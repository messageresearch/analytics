[21:09] We want to remember brother Ernie Villa
[21:12] this evening as he's not able to be with
[21:13] us as a ear infection at home. Also want
[21:16] to remember Jonathan Anthony and Nicole

[21:23] Amen. Want to lift up the Frey family.
[21:25] We know they give so much of their time
[21:27] and their energy here at the school.
[21:28] It's a blessing to see each one that has
[21:31] been so faithful in contributing and
[21:33] those that are able to even give a
[21:35] little of their time. It means a lot and
[21:37] it goes a long ways. We want to
[21:39] appreciate you this evening as well.
[21:40] Brother Darren,
[21:42] man, if you have a need upon your heart
[21:44] this evening
[21:46] or just in this atmosphere, just say,
[21:48] "Lord, speak to me."
[21:52] Whatever you'd have on the servant's
[21:53] heart tonight, our pastor is going to
[21:56] come in a few moments. Deliver what the
[21:58] Lord has laid on his heart, but it takes
[22:00] us to hear to receive it and take God at
[22:04] his word. Amen. Will you pull on the
[22:07] gift of God tonight? Amen. Brother
[22:09] Darren,
[22:10] [Music]
[22:15] let's bow our heads.
[22:17] [Music]
[22:21] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful,
[22:23] Lord, that we can come into your
[22:24] presence tonight,
[22:27] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. So thankful that we are your
[22:29] children,
[22:30] &gt;&gt; that we've been birthed by the spirit of
[22:33] truth,
[22:35] &gt;&gt; Lord God. We're so thankful, Lord Jesus,
[22:37] that all around us is gross darkness,
[22:39] but yet you've given us light. Father,
[22:42] you've put a difference between us and
[22:44] the and the people and the things of
[22:46] this world. You've put a mark upon us,
[22:48] Father. You've given us your Holy
[22:50] Spirit. You've given us life and life
[22:52] more abundantly. Father, that we can
[22:55] live above all the cares of this world.
[22:57] We can live above all the the trials,
[22:59] Lord, the temptations, the persecutions,
[23:01] Lord, the sicknesses that come upon us.
[23:04] Father, you've given us your word,
[23:06] Father. A word that cannot fail. But you
[23:09] said you'd be with us and even in us to
[23:10] the end of the world. Father, all these
[23:12] precious promises you've given us, Lord,
[23:14] it encourages us. Father, I'm thankful
[23:17] for the word that even encouraged me
[23:18] today, Lord. Just going through a trial
[23:20] and you just whispered, "It's just a
[23:22] trial." And I was just rejoicing, dear
[23:24] God. Lord Jesus, you're mindful of us,
[23:27] Lord God. No matter what we're going
[23:29] through, you're there to give us
[23:31] strength, Lord God. You're there to
[23:32] touch our bodies when we're feeling
[23:34] weak. Dear God, you're there to forgive
[23:36] us when we do wrong, Lord. The blood is
[23:38] still flowing tonight, Lord Jesus. And I
[23:41] pray, Father God, that you just forgive
[23:42] us of all of our sin, all of our
[23:44] iniquities, Lord, that it all be under
[23:46] the blood, all cast into the sea of your
[23:48] forgetfulness, Lord Jesus, that nothing
[23:51] would hinder us, Lord. Not even Satan
[23:53] would be able to stand before us this
[23:55] night, dear God, as the word of God is
[23:57] ministered to us, Lord. Whether we're
[23:59] here, Lord, whether we're at home not
[24:01] feeling well as our brother Ernie with
[24:03] his ear infection, Lord. Father, raise
[24:05] him up. We pray, dear God. Lord Jesus,
[24:08] we pray that you'll take, Lord Jesus,
[24:10] the fray children, Lord, they're not
[24:11] feeling well. Raise them up, Father.
[24:13] It's your word, Lord Jesus. You've
[24:15] already spoken. By your stripes, they're
[24:17] already healed. Father, we're claiming
[24:20] it, Lord Jesus. We're combining our
[24:22] faith with theirs, Lord. Oh, Lord Jesus.
[24:24] We thank you for these promises, Lord,
[24:26] and we're walking in them, Father. This
[24:28] is our inheritance. This is a portion,
[24:31] Lord, the allotment that you've given us
[24:32] in this hour, and we've received it,
[24:35] Lord Jesus. We're walking in it, Lord
[24:37] God, and we're we're manifesting it,
[24:39] Lord. We give you the glory, dear God.
[24:42] We give you the praise for you're still
[24:44] working on us, Father. There's still a
[24:46] work for us to do in this world, Lord
[24:48] Jesus. Help us to be faithful, Lord.
[24:51] Help us to press in, dear God, to catch
[24:54] that Holy Ghost burden, dear Lord Jesus,
[24:56] to reach out to that last soul, dear
[24:59] God, to reach out to our loved ones, to
[25:01] our children, Lord, to those that are
[25:03] walking in darkness, dear God, that they
[25:06] would see the great light of Jesus
[25:07] Christ in our lives. That light would
[25:09] attract them, Father. That you would woo
[25:12] them to yourself, Lord, just as you've
[25:14] done us, Lord. How we rejoice, Lord God.
[25:17] We rejoice that we can be a part of this
[25:19] great calling, this great plan of
[25:22] redemption. How it humbles us, Lord.
[25:24] We're nothing, dear God, without you.
[25:27] But you've elevated us, Lord Jesus, to
[25:29] your right hand. You've elevated us to
[25:31] the throne of God. We've ele you've
[25:33] elevated us, Father God, to your side.
[25:36] And Lord Jesus, we just want to sit at
[25:38] your side tonight. Sit at your feet,
[25:40] Lord Jesus, as you would speak through
[25:42] our pastor.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; Lord God, you've prepared a word for
[25:45] him, Lord. A word in due season. And
[25:47] Lord Jesus, I'm here to receive what you
[25:49] have for us tonight. Lord Jesus, we're
[25:52] putting in our order in. Even if we have
[25:54] it, Lord, we can put our order in right
[25:56] now. That you'll do great and wondrous
[25:58] things in our midst tonight, Lord Jesus.
[26:01] That lives would be touched, Lord. Lives
[26:03] would be set on fire. That people would
[26:05] be filled with the Holy Ghost, Lord
[26:08] Jesus, that people would be saved.
[26:09] People would be healed, Lord God. That
[26:11] many mighty miracles, oh God, would be
[26:13] performed, Lord God, in our midst. For
[26:15] you said signs and wonders would follow
[26:17] them that believe. We're believing
[26:19] tonight, Lord. We're accepting the word.
[26:21] We're believers, dear God. We're
[26:23] expecting, Lord Jesus, for you to move
[26:25] on the scene this this night, Lord. Oh,
[26:28] God. We're believers, Lord. Let our
[26:30] faith, Lord God, just be united tonight,
[26:32] Lord, for those that maybe feel tired,
[26:35] downtrodden, Lord. We're here to
[26:37] encourage them, Father. We're here to
[26:39] lift them up, oh God. We're a we're a
[26:41] body ministry, Lord Jesus, ministering
[26:43] to each one. So God, we're just waiting
[26:46] upon you, Lord. Send the fire, Father.

[26:52] We're waiting in anticipation, Father,
[26:54] for what you've laid upon our pastor's
[26:56] heart. No doubt it's something that we
[26:58] have need of even tonight. Something,
[27:00] Lord Jesus, that will give us strength,
[27:02] that will give us courage, that will
[27:04] give us that ability, Father, just to
[27:06] press on, Lord God, more so than ever
[27:08] before.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord Jesus.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; We so love you.

[28:03] that's the office of a pastor. Lord, the
[28:05] head of the local body. We just want to

[31:03] granted, but I picked some fruit. It was
[31:06] ripe. They're good songs. So maybe I'll
[31:09] get Brother Ryan to teach them to us
[31:10] because I'm not much of a song teacher.

[33:47] [Music]
[33:51] &gt;&gt; How wonderful to be gathered
[33:54] &gt;&gt; around his word. Amen. Good to be in the
[33:57] house of God.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be in the land of the living
[34:00] and be here
[34:01] &gt;&gt; so we can worship together,
[34:04] &gt;&gt; read together.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Infallible word of God.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Just wonderful.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; The service tonight uh will be probably
[34:14] kind of a leadin to Sunday morning. So,
[34:17] uh those that are not here, I hope they
[34:20] will get to perhaps stream it ahead of
[34:23] time. And uh those of you that are here,
[34:26] you might want to just make special note
[34:29] of some of the scriptures in the
[34:30] direction that we're in and it'll help
[34:32] you on Sunday morning. I also want to
[34:34] mention to you that we are preparing
[34:38] and there have been preparations being
[34:40] made for uh M Murphy'sboro convention
[34:44] which is on the 4th, 5th and 6th of
[34:47] November.
[34:49] And uh pastor Joseph Hammed there has
[34:52] just had this very very much on his
[34:54] heart for a number of years. And now I
[34:57] think this is the third year that we're
[34:59] having the convention there. He he's
[35:02] really burdened for we say missions but
[35:05] it is to get the word out to the people
[35:08] and that is our our burden. And so he
[35:10] came here and he's w kind of watched the
[35:13] work over the years and he just said he
[35:16] wants to be uh uh like a a a station
[35:22] down there in the south and the
[35:24] southeast. So we we're thankful for
[35:26] that. We're thankful for the opportunity
[35:29] and uh this week in fact is I believe
[35:31] tomorrow the uh missions faith challenge
[35:34] report is going to be off. So, you'll be
[35:36] able to get your copies on Sunday. And I
[35:39] would appeal to you once again, young
[35:41] and old. You have a friend. Everybody's
[35:43] got a friend, a few friends. Even if you
[35:46] have an enemy, send one to them. And uh
[35:50] that would be very scriptural. Uh and
[35:53] it'll do them good. It'll really do them
[35:55] good whether they're close or far. So,
[35:58] we'd appreciate that. We appreciate your
[36:00] prayers for these meetings. Also the
[36:03] very following weekend, November 11th,
[36:05] 12th, and 13th, uh we are to be with
[36:08] brother David McGuri in Dallas, Fort
[36:12] Worth. And the Lord certainly did some
[36:14] supernatural things the last time we
[36:16] were there, and he just wanted to have
[36:18] the meeting again this year. I would
[36:20] request that you also pray for Brother
[36:23] Ivan. He's uh in China and I just got
[36:27] we've gotten several emails, but I just
[36:29] got uh one that I believe this morning
[36:33] and uh they he gave a number of gave
[36:36] some pictures perhaps we'll be able to
[36:38] show you on Sunday, but there's two
[36:40] sisters uh and a and a young girl
[36:44] working and then with them is uh two
[36:49] another couple of volunteers that come
[36:51] in and give their time. He said they
[36:53] work generally at least 10 hours a day.
[36:56] They are there there is orders coming
[36:59] in. People are calling in, writing in,
[37:02] texting, whatever for the message books
[37:06] because they realize now since the hub
[37:09] more people are learning that there's
[37:12] message messages that are available in
[37:14] the Chinese and English and Vietnamese
[37:17] on the hub and they're ordering
[37:19] individual ones. They're doing between
[37:21] two and 400 a day.
[37:25] Isn't that incredible? And sending them
[37:27] all over China as far as Japan and
[37:31] Australia on the other side. And I I
[37:34] just say God bless them.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; So on your behalf, I I just went forward
[37:40] and they needed another printer,
[37:42] commercial printer. They're similar to
[37:45] the ones we have for the hub here, only
[37:47] they buy them over there. So, we sent
[37:49] them $2,000 from your missions giving so
[37:53] they could uh uh continue this work. I
[37:56] mean, you know, these people are for the
[37:59] most part really quite poor. They were
[38:00] they said, "Well, we'll do it on our
[38:02] own." And I just I knew that's too great
[38:05] a burden. So, we shared with it.
[38:07] Furthermore, I think it's a blessing for
[38:09] us to know that perhaps we provided that
[38:13] someone you've read a book recently. You
[38:15] heard a message recently and you were
[38:18] blessed. Some of these are seeing it for
[38:20] the first time.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, that's a real joy. Brother
[38:24] Murphy, of course, just left. Just
[38:26] arrived last Saturday and uh there was
[38:30] many churches and pastors and of course
[38:32] they wanted him to stay. uh we needed
[38:35] him here and uh so let's remember those
[38:38] that he just left. Also on Friday night
[38:42] of the prayer service and brother Kyle
[38:44] is back from uh hunting trip with
[38:48] brother Dave and and brother Jose and
[38:51] brother
[38:53] uh let's see brother Blake How and Sam
[38:58] and I were along just for the ride. But
[39:01] anyway, uh the other brothers did a lot
[39:04] of the work and but we're having the
[39:06] prayer service on Friday night and I
[39:09] know that it's also been mentioned the
[39:11] the workers at the school. I I've been
[39:13] so encouraged to see people coming there
[39:15] almost every day and I know we're
[39:18] winding up and we just have little work
[39:21] to do. So God bless the people. It it
[39:25] won't be in vain. Amen.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; I'll have you turn in your Bibles to
[39:30] Amos the 8th chapter.
[39:32] And Amos is just after Joel.
[39:44] No, I'll preach if you pull.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. I told Brother John if he can't
[39:51] pull to push.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:00] I'm going to start reading at the 11th
[40:02] verse. But just before we read, let's
[40:04] let's pray once more.
[40:08] Blessed, lovely Lord Jesus.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; What a privilege it is, what an honor it
[40:14] is for us to call you our Lord, our
[40:18] Savior.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Oh God, our Lord and our God.
[40:24] My Lord Jesus, it is in your name. If
[40:27] that had not been given and uh and
[40:30] granted to us, we wouldn't have this
[40:32] approach to the almighty God. And we
[40:36] just give you honor and praise, oh Lord.
[40:39] You're the holy one of Israel.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; You're the holy one that Abraham
[40:44] worshiped, Isaac and Jacob worshiped.
[40:46] And the prophets were moved by the Holy
[40:49] Spirit, your spirit. and they they pen
[40:52] down these words, some that we will read
[40:54] tonight. I pray that you'll give us
[40:57] insight.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Give us enlightenment, oh God. Give us
[41:00] faith as we hear the word. I pray,
[41:03] Father, you'll bless your people
[41:05] immensely. Anoint us, oh God. Anoint me
[41:07] as I standing here at the post of duty
[41:10] to speak. Your will be done on earth as
[41:13] it is in heaven. And all the people
[41:15] could say, "Amen." Amen. Reading now
[41:20] Amos 8 and 11.
[41:22] Behold, the days come, sayaeth the Lord
[41:25] God, that I will send a famine in the
[41:28] land. Notice who's sending it. I will
[41:30] send a famine in the land. Not a famine
[41:33] of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of
[41:36] hearing the words of the Lord. And they
[41:39] shall wander from sea to sea, and from
[41:42] the north even to the east. and they
[41:45] shall run to and fro
[41:47] uh to seek the word of the Lord and
[41:50] shall not find it.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; In that day shall the fair virgins and
[41:54] young men faint for thirst.
[41:58] And now I'm just reading this verse. You
[42:00] can listen. Job 42 and5. I have heard of
[42:03] thee by the hearing of the ear, but now
[42:08] mine eye seeth thee.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you as you have
[42:14] your seats.
[42:21] You'll have to kind of release the
[42:24] boundaries of your mind tonight as we uh
[42:28] think of this and speak about this
[42:30] subject because I found uh as I studied
[42:35] and I've been pondering this for some
[42:37] time
[42:38] uh hearing is not a very easy subject to
[42:42] define
[42:44] and brother
[42:46] brother Darren in his prayer actually
[42:49] quoted the title that I had to this
[42:51] message until I I felt I would just
[42:54] change it to call it something else
[42:56] because brother Brandham preached the
[42:58] message hearing recognizing and acting
[43:02] &gt;&gt; and brother Darren used those exact
[43:04] words as he was coming towards the end
[43:06] of his prayer which was really a kind
[43:10] confirmation to myself said to hear and
[43:14] to recognize and to act upon the word
[43:17] but I I want to uh entitle this
[43:20] predestinated to hear the voice
[43:24] and the subject is going to kind of get
[43:28] off in some distant places. But I think
[43:30] we need that to realize
[43:34] uh that the hearing is not just with the
[43:36] faculty of our eardrum
[43:40] and our what what we process in our mind
[43:44] and the thoughts that we get. I'll speak
[43:47] certain words tonight, but all of you
[43:49] people, you're not going to process the
[43:52] thoughts exactly the same. It's not
[43:55] going to mean I may make a statement and
[43:57] it'll mean one thing to one sister,
[43:59] another thing to another brother over
[44:01] there, and something entirely different
[44:03] to someone over here because our minds
[44:06] just go in those directions. But God
[44:08] knows exactly what you need.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; He knows just what each one of us needs.
[44:14] And so when I thought about this hearing
[44:18] uh and I thought about what the Bible
[44:20] has to say and the Bible has much much
[44:23] to say about hearing. For example,
[44:28] uh the the scriptures begin with the
[44:31] words in Genesis 1 and3 because there's
[44:33] nothing to hear unless somebody speaks.
[44:37] And so we we we're starting right early
[44:40] in the Bible with the with the words to
[44:42] give us a a beginning this evening. But
[44:46] the ability the ability to hear and to
[44:49] respond to the call of God goes far
[44:53] beyond the faculties as I said a moment
[44:56] ago of the physical hearing or the
[44:59] emotional attachment because people can
[45:03] you know they hear something but inside
[45:06] inwardly they have a much stronger
[45:10] uh uh feeling about something because
[45:12] even the words will inspire something
[45:15] within.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; You know,
[45:18] &gt;&gt; that's why they say when, you know, when
[45:20] we speak to one another or be kind to
[45:22] one another or whatever we say to one
[45:25] another, it it can have it will have an
[45:29] effect,
[45:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Uh on the individual. That's why we say
[45:32] to people, God bless you. Because that
[45:36] should have an effect on the people. Uh
[45:39] uh someone says to a member of their
[45:42] family, I love you. it has an effect. Uh
[45:46] we're glad that we hear those words
[45:48] &gt;&gt; and we appreciate that.
[45:51] Now,
[45:53] uh, just just so you ponder these things
[45:55] as we start out,
[45:57] I want to read this because I I I spend
[46:00] a lot of time on a short phrase, but if
[46:05] the entire bride body of Jesus Christ
[46:09] suddenly and instantly experienced a
[46:12] complete cleansing of every connection
[46:16] and attachment
[46:18] to their place of fellowship. Now they
[46:21] can't change their place of residence
[46:24] but their place of fellowship and who
[46:27] they fellowship with. Uh every
[46:30] connection and attachment outside of the
[46:33] voice of God
[46:36] through the chosen vessels that God has
[46:38] ordained. I'm quite certain that there
[46:41] would be a massive movement and
[46:44] readjustment within that body of Christ.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; In other words, they say, "Well, what
[46:49] are you saying, brother Biscell? I'm
[46:50] saying that a lot of people are perhaps
[46:53] within the ranks of the message because
[46:56] they someone else that they're close to
[46:59] is there
[47:01] &gt;&gt; or someone my friends are there
[47:03] &gt;&gt; or my family is there and that has
[47:06] nothing to do with it. It is that every
[47:09] person needs to be where you're seated
[47:11] tonight because you've heard the voice
[47:13] of God.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; You heard a personal call
[47:17] &gt;&gt; to your own soul.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. and something happened within. In
[47:22] other words, you heard with an inner
[47:24] voice.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; You heard something from within.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; It isn't something that moved you and
[47:29] attached you emotionally
[47:31] &gt;&gt; or physically in any special way, but it
[47:34] is that you had a an experience with the
[47:38] voice of God.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; God spoke,
[47:42] &gt;&gt; God called and you responded. Amen.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Now for example the basis of fellowship
[47:51] as in John 1 and 1 John 1 and7. But if
[47:54] we walk in the light as he is in the
[47:57] light if if if we walk in the light as
[48:01] he is in the light we have fellowship
[48:05] one with another. That's really the only
[48:08] basis of fellowship. If we walk in the
[48:10] light as he is in light and the
[48:13] conjunction word, the blood of Jesus
[48:15] Christ his son cleanseth us from all
[48:18] sins. That happens to be a very powerful
[48:22] scripture.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; If we walk in the light as he is in the
[48:26] light, then we have fellowship one with
[48:28] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[48:31] cleanseth us from all sin. So that's
[48:33] just an example of what I'm speaking of
[48:36] as the basis for fellowship.
[48:39] family or friends may play a big part
[48:41] and it should.
[48:44] Some of the disciples were brothers
[48:47] &gt;&gt; and brother Bram speaks about their
[48:49] father speaking to them about the
[48:51] Messiah that would come and then the
[48:54] Messiah came in their time in their age
[48:57] and called them and that's the grace of
[48:59] God upon that family. And we have it
[49:02] right here. And I'm thankful for the
[49:05] grace of God upon our families. And you
[49:08] that are here with your families and
[49:10] those of you that are here that h are
[49:12] younger and perhaps don't have families
[49:14] yet. You're part of a family. You want
[49:16] to thank God for the family you're a
[49:18] part of. You want to thank God that God
[49:20] ever breathed upon the soul and spoke to
[49:24] your father, your mother, or whoever
[49:26] else. and uh and so our our talents and
[49:30] our position in life uh should have a
[49:33] positive effect upon our uh our
[49:37] contribution to the body of Jesus
[49:38] Christ, but it is not the basis of
[49:40] fellowship. So we're thankful for every
[49:43] talent and every skill and every person,
[49:46] every willing worker uh whether whether
[49:49] you're highly visible or not, that
[49:51] doesn't make any difference. Uh it is
[49:54] according to the scripture it is the it
[49:56] is the one that's almost invisible the
[49:58] lowly ones that would be in a
[50:00] congregation that must be esteemed
[50:03] because we do not know how to value
[50:06] things the way God values it. It's not,
[50:08] you know, just from the ministry or the
[50:11] pastor or or those that are so visible,
[50:15] but it is every member of the body of
[50:17] Christ is to be highly esteemed
[50:21] &gt;&gt; and we have fellowship. So now I start
[50:24] out by saying a scripture that you all
[50:27] know very very well.
[50:29] Third verse in the Bible says, "And God
[50:32] said,
[50:34] &gt;&gt; "Let there be lights."
[50:36] &gt;&gt; And there was light.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; So God said, you've heard me speaking it
[50:41] here before because I don't want you to
[50:43] think I'm on one track, but I don't know
[50:45] what language he used. I don't know if
[50:47] there is a language. I don't know if
[50:49] there is an audible sound. But he spoke
[50:52] to the elements. He spoke to his
[50:55] creation. And his creation in whatever
[50:59] form it was responded positively. Let
[51:03] there be light.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; And there was light.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Something heard it.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Something adjusted. Something moved.
[51:10] Something blew into a flaming fire and
[51:13] gave light.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; And we had a greater light to rule the
[51:16] day and a lesser light to rule the
[51:19] night.
[51:21] And the the word that is is used in
[51:24] Hebrew for said,
[51:26] it is to speak or to utter, but it goes
[51:29] beyond that. It is to say in one's
[51:33] heart. So God could have
[51:37] just desired it.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; God could have or that word also is to
[51:42] think
[51:44] &gt;&gt; or to command. So God could have had it
[51:46] in his mind
[51:47] &gt;&gt; and just focus his thoughts and said, "I
[51:50] want a light.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; I want a great light. That's what I
[51:55] desire." He's the creator. He didn't
[51:57] have to have a language.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; He could think it. He could command it.
[52:05] Or it is also to promise. And God said
[52:08] it is to make a promise. I'm going to
[52:10] have a light. I don't whether it took a
[52:12] hundred million years. It's that's
[52:15] irrelevant.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; God desired it. God thought about it.
[52:19] God intended it and God said it and it
[52:22] happened.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; God spoke to the heavens. God spoke to
[52:28] the waters. God spoke to the earth and
[52:32] to man and in each case
[52:36] said very specific things. And God said,
[52:39] "Let there be light." And there was
[52:40] light. And God said, "Let there be a
[52:43] firmament in the midst of the waters,
[52:45] and let it divide the waters from the
[52:47] waters." And it did. And God said, "Let
[52:51] the waters under the heaven be gathered
[52:53] together unto one place, and let the dry
[52:55] land appear." And it was so.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; And the God said, "Let the earth."
[53:01] Here's God speaking.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; He's talking to the earth.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; He's talking to the heavens.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; He's talking to the planets. He's He's
[53:10] got intention for all of these things.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; He probably said at some point in time,
[53:14] "And don't get out of time
[53:18] &gt;&gt; because he's going to have a prophet
[53:19] come on down the road and tell us
[53:22] thousands of years later." They're
[53:23] they're so precise. They're just a uh
[53:26] absolutely to the second right on time.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; And God said, "Let there be lights in
[53:34] the firmament." And there was. And God
[53:37] said, "Let the waters bring forth
[53:41] abundantly
[53:42] &gt;&gt; the moving creatures that hath life."
[53:44] And it did. And God said, "Let the earth
[53:47] bring forth." Now he's talking to the
[53:49] earth. "Let the earth bring forth
[53:52] the living creature after its kind." And
[53:56] then God said, "Let us make man in our
[53:59] image." And he did.
[54:02] The creator speaking to his creation.
[54:06] Amen.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; And whatever form that substance was in,
[54:10] be it liquid H2O
[54:13] or whether it was earth or whether it
[54:17] was air or whether it was planets, the
[54:21] creator
[54:22] &gt;&gt; in whatever form he spoke or desired it
[54:26] or commanded it or promised it or
[54:28] intended it that I want you to have a
[54:32] better understanding of the God we
[54:34] serve. Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; And he is he's conscious of every
[54:39] thought we have
[54:41] &gt;&gt; and he just thought those things or
[54:43] intended those things or spoke those
[54:46] things. Anyway, the word is God said it
[54:48] and it happened.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; That's how he gives. Can there be a
[54:52] promise? Can there be any kind of a
[54:54] promise of God that could fail that kind
[54:57] of a God?
[54:58] &gt;&gt; I think that this surely ought to
[55:01] inspire faith into your hearts tonight.
[55:03] And God said, "And the creator speaking
[55:07] to his creation,
[55:09] &gt;&gt; the substance of creation heard him,
[55:15] &gt;&gt; and whatever form it was in, it heard
[55:17] him
[55:19] &gt;&gt; and responded accordingly.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; The waters brought forth."
[55:23] &gt;&gt; And it didn't bring forth just anything.
[55:26] It brought forth what he thought it
[55:28] should bring forth,
[55:30] &gt;&gt; and bring forth creatures.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; The scripture says Psalms 33:6, "By the
[55:39] word of the Lord, were the heavens made
[55:41] and all the and all the host of them by
[55:44] the breath of his mouth."
[55:46] &gt;&gt; In Hebrews scripture, the prophet refers
[55:49] to often through faith. We understand
[55:52] that the worlds were framed by the word
[55:55] of God so that things which are seen
[55:58] were made of things which do not appear.
[56:03] The serpent
[56:04] &gt;&gt; was also part of this creation.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; But he crossed the boundaries.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; He crossed the boundaries
[56:18] of his
[56:23] created being.
[56:25] When he went to the woman,
[56:28] there's no place where there was ever
[56:30] any allowance for him, a creature like
[56:33] that, to come to a higher one and to
[56:37] speak.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; He crossed the boundaries. I want you to
[56:41] watch that very closely. You may say,
[56:42] "Well, where are you going, brother
[56:44] Bisc? Why are we speaking about these
[56:45] things?" Because when you find any
[56:50] spirit begins to manifest itself and
[56:52] wants to lift itself up,
[56:56] It's not coming from the right
[56:57] direction.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Let every man abide in his own calling.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; When you find the people become lifted
[57:04] up, a person kind of becomes lifted up.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; I don't care what they're in, but they
[57:09] start to be lifted up within themselves,
[57:11] it's a wrong spirit.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:17] So the serpent
[57:19] was also part of the creation but he
[57:22] crossed these bounds when he spoke to
[57:24] the woman. He never heard his creator
[57:28] God give permission to speak to the
[57:31] woman. It's never there.
[57:36] Thou has been in Eden. The scripture
[57:38] says in Ezekiel, "Thou hast been in
[57:41] Eden, and every precious stone was thy
[57:45] covering. The sardest topaz, and the
[57:48] diamond, and the burl, and the onyx, and
[57:50] the jasper, and the sapphire, the
[57:52] emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold.
[57:54] The workmanship of thy tabts, and of thy
[57:57] pipes, that is the joints, etc., was
[58:00] prepared in thee in the day that thou
[58:02] was created." He was a created being.
[58:06] But this created being also said uh
[58:09] prophet Isaiah speaking he said for thou
[58:11] hast said in thine heart God revealing
[58:14] what was in his heart I will ascend into
[58:17] heaven. I will exalt my throne above the
[58:20] stars of God. I will also sit in uh I
[58:23] will sit also upon the mount of the
[58:26] congregation in the sides of the north
[58:28] and I will ascend above the heights of
[58:30] the clouds and I will be like the most
[58:33] high. So now you can see that Satan
[58:36] himself, Lucifer, who had been cast to
[58:39] the earth, is now taking and accessing
[58:43] humanity through the facility of the
[58:47] serpent.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Satan cast out of heaven seeking to
[58:55] ascend because that's his whole theme. I
[58:58] will ascend. I will ascend. I will sit.
[59:01] I will do this. I will do that. Lifting
[59:04] himself up. That desire to lift himself
[59:07] above what God had given him, the
[59:10] position God had given him. And that's
[59:12] the origin of that that spirit. And he
[59:16] and and so whenever Satan takes control
[59:19] of a thing or a person, they begin to be
[59:22] lifted up from their calling or their
[59:24] position. So it says, "Now the serpent
[59:28] was more subtle than any beast of the
[59:30] field which the Lord had Lord God had
[59:34] made. And he said unto the woman, now
[59:37] notice, he said unto the woman, ye hath
[59:40] God said, notice how subtle, perhaps
[59:43] you've never noticed this before. I
[59:45] begin to see some new things in it. You
[59:48] shall Did God say you shall not eat of
[59:50] every tree of the garden?" That's not
[59:52] what God said exactly. And the woman
[59:56] said unto the serpent, "You, we may eat
[59:59] of the fruit of the trees of the
[1:00:00] garden." God told him, "You can eat of
[1:00:02] the fruit of the trees of the garden,
[1:00:04] but not this one of the tree of
[1:00:06] knowledge and and of good and
[1:00:08] knowledge." So he said, "Did you shall
[1:00:12] did God say you shall not eat of every
[1:00:15] tree of the garden?" He's identifying
[1:00:18] himself.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; You understand? He's identifying himself
[1:00:23] because he was the one that she was not
[1:00:25] to partake of.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Now, so uh I I want you to notice first
[1:00:32] and now the serpent said
[1:00:35] and then the woman said,
[1:00:38] "We may eat of the fruit of the trees of
[1:00:40] the garden, but of the fruit of the tree
[1:00:42] which is in the midst of the garden, God
[1:00:44] has said, you shall not eat it, neither
[1:00:46] shall you touch it, lest you die." And
[1:00:47] the serpent said. So now we we start off
[1:00:51] and God said and God said and God said
[1:00:54] let there be lights and God said let
[1:00:55] there be a firmament and God said let
[1:00:57] the waters be divided and God said let
[1:00:59] the waters bring forth and God said let
[1:01:01] the let the earth bring forth and it did
[1:01:04] and it did and it did and now we have
[1:01:07] and the serpent was the most subtle and
[1:01:08] he said
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; so now he is being like acting like God
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; and then she said Adam he hasn't said
[1:01:19] anything yet? And and and the serpent
[1:01:22] said unto the unto the woman,
[1:01:27] and the woman said unto the serpent.
[1:01:30] So now they're also directing the
[1:01:33] conversation.
[1:01:36] You might, you know, just to give you a
[1:01:38] little breather here for a moment.
[1:01:43] You know, parents especially, they
[1:01:45] realize it and perhaps others you've had
[1:01:47] the experience, but you you're talking
[1:01:50] to somebody and they don't indicate any
[1:01:53] acknowledgment of what you said
[1:01:56] and you say, "Do you hear me?
[1:02:00] I'm talking to you."
[1:02:03] Oh, a few people have smiled. I know
[1:02:06] you've done it. I got a quote here where
[1:02:10] the prophet of God says, "Satan, I'm
[1:02:13] talking to you."
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; He's getting his attention.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Then he tells them what he plans to do.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; So the serpent said, the serpent said,
[1:02:29] "And he was cast down to crawl upon his
[1:02:32] belly on the earth." One of the first
[1:02:36] signs that God had Moses do through
[1:02:39] Aaron, told Aaron, "Cast your rod down."
[1:02:43] And it became a serpent.
[1:02:46] Take it up again by the tail. And it
[1:02:48] became a rod again. And went before
[1:02:50] Pharaoh and said, "Cast your rod down."
[1:02:53] Pharaoh's magicians did with their
[1:02:56] enchantment the same thing. And Aaron's
[1:02:58] rod swallowed all of theirs up. Brother
[1:03:01] Brandham says, "You know what he did?"
[1:03:02] He says he took that rod with their
[1:03:03] serpents in it and went and did
[1:03:05] miracles.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; See, some of you need to read the
[1:03:10] message. It is there. I didn't dream
[1:03:13] that up. He did say that.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:18] But from that day, the tree of humanity
[1:03:23] began to wither until in the end time
[1:03:27] there would be a famine for hearing the
[1:03:31] word of God.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; So when the serpent started speaking,
[1:03:37] the devil has had a heyday ever since.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, what's all these
[1:03:43] gadgets about?
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; What's all this telephone business?
[1:03:46] What's all this social network about?
[1:03:48] What's all this about in the end time?
[1:03:50] You think, hey, and not many years ago,
[1:03:52] they didn't have such a thing as a
[1:03:54] telephone.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Some of you that lived on the farm, or
[1:03:59] if you ever did live on the farm, they'd
[1:04:01] hook a wire with a tin can onto a onto a
[1:04:04] fence and could get get to hear a voice
[1:04:07] two, three miles away on on the barb
[1:04:10] wire.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Did you know that? Anybody here ever
[1:04:13] know that?
[1:04:15] Oh, there you are. Oh, man. You're
[1:04:18] telling us where you're from, brother
[1:04:20] Derek. That is really in the sticks. But
[1:04:22] I I've done it. I've had the can up to
[1:04:24] my ear and, you know, yell something
[1:04:27] here and say, "What do you say?
[1:04:31] Sounds scratchy." It is scratchy, but
[1:04:33] it's better than walking three miles
[1:04:40] until the end time and there be a famine
[1:04:42] for hearing the words of God. That's
[1:04:44] right.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; In the message, the world is again
[1:04:46] falling apart. Brother Brandham said,
[1:04:49] "No wonder we're falling apart."
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; There's nothing. He stops. The very
[1:04:55] thing that created the earth, the very
[1:04:58] thing that was put here for the earth to
[1:05:01] turn on, the very thing that systems and
[1:05:04] everything else was to revolve around
[1:05:07] this word that by God framed the world.
[1:05:11] Amen.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; No wonder it's falling apart again
[1:05:14] because the word of God there isn't the
[1:05:17] same availability. It's not being heard
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; the same way.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; If God is silent, God can be silent.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; In the Bible, between Malachi and and
[1:05:28] Matthew, there was 400 years and it's
[1:05:30] commonly said 400 years of silence.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; There wasn't the words of God being
[1:05:37] spoken by the prophets of God. Malachi
[1:05:40] to to John the Baptist was a silent
[1:05:43] time. And there's been times when when
[1:05:47] God has been silent. He'll move in some
[1:05:50] great way and then he just lets it as it
[1:05:53] were coast and see and then men made
[1:05:56] denominations and they made all their
[1:05:57] systems and everything and God just
[1:05:59] pulled back from it.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Let them do what they want. And brother
[1:06:03] Brandon keeps saying and then he pruned
[1:06:04] the branch. Pruned the branch. cut it
[1:06:07] off because it was no longer fruitful
[1:06:09] with his with his uh with his life and
[1:06:12] his fruit. So,
[1:06:15] uh and then in the message turning on
[1:06:17] the light, he said, "But God's going to
[1:06:19] have a bride tree." Because now I said
[1:06:22] this, it it withered. God's going to
[1:06:24] have a bride tree. And all that the
[1:06:27] cankerorm ate and the caterpillar said,
[1:06:31] "I will restore, sayeth the Lord." Mal
[1:06:34] Malachi 4 tells us we'd be brought back
[1:06:37] to the original faith like it was on the
[1:06:40] day of Pentecost, the faith of the
[1:06:42] fathers. So, we believe that it will
[1:06:45] come. I I believe it's time for it now.
[1:06:49] The limbs were withered and dried up and
[1:06:53] they'll be taking them from the tree so
[1:06:56] that the tree can bear itself right in
[1:07:00] the top of the tree, bear fruit. uh bear
[1:07:03] bear itself right in the top of the
[1:07:05] tree. In other words, reproduce itself
[1:07:07] right in the top of the tree. And you
[1:07:10] may wonder why brother Brandham is
[1:07:11] saying things uh saying it in this way.
[1:07:14] And and they're being pruned off.
[1:07:16] They're being trimmed off because at
[1:07:19] that time they were still uh his
[1:07:22] ministry and the ministry and the
[1:07:24] churches and denominations were very
[1:07:26] much still integrated. They were using
[1:07:29] him, using his name, having meetings,
[1:07:32] having conventions. But he could foresee
[1:07:35] that they were going to be pruned off
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; and leave the bride tree.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; The bride tree hasn't got Christian
[1:07:43] Businessman Association branches
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; and all kinds of denominational
[1:07:47] branches. But at that time, it still
[1:07:49] did. But he's saying that time has come.
[1:07:53] And that's why they were casting him out
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; because God was pruning them off
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; so that the bride tree which this word
[1:08:02] came to bring and restore back
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; was coming into being.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Okay. A famine of hearing the words of
[1:08:13] the Lord. Number one. Number one. Not
[1:08:17] only that many will not hear the word of
[1:08:20] God even though it was spoken. They
[1:08:22] won't hear the word of God. That's
[1:08:24] number one. For for example, because
[1:08:26] they obeyed not the voice. Second, this
[1:08:28] is 2 Kings 18 and 12. Because they
[1:08:31] obeyed not the voice of the Lord their
[1:08:33] God, but transgressed his covenant and
[1:08:36] all that Moses the servant of the Lord
[1:08:38] commanded and would not hear them nor do
[1:08:42] them. So that's number one, the people
[1:08:45] won't do it. But number two is I've got
[1:08:48] several scriptures on that. But number
[1:08:50] two, the famine of the hearing of the
[1:08:52] words of God is because God has not
[1:08:55] dispensing with it. God hasn't got the a
[1:08:59] Luther or hasn't got a Wesley or hasn't
[1:09:02] got uh a prophet of God as we've had in
[1:09:05] this generation. And so the words of God
[1:09:09] are not. You want to be very, very
[1:09:13] thankful. We have such free access.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; And we don't just have access to the
[1:09:21] just to live by faith.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; And and a and a man who smoked a pipe
[1:09:25] and drank beer.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; That was Luther
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; and hated the Jews.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; That was Luther's. I understand. I'm not
[1:09:32] his judge. But God used him.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; That was the light that he had. And God
[1:09:38] used him with a revelation, the just
[1:09:40] shall live by faith. And he was one of
[1:09:42] God's messengers for that age.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; I'm glad we're not just under that age
[1:09:48] because it wouldn't satisfy. That's why
[1:09:51] the brother Brandham also said that he
[1:09:53] said if I preached a denominational
[1:09:55] doctrine, it wouldn't mean anything to
[1:09:58] you. Aren't you glad about that?
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't mean anything to you. And
[1:10:03] then he talks about this message. He
[1:10:05] said this message is not for them
[1:10:07] because it's too rich.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; It would make them sick.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; But now you have a different spiritual
[1:10:13] constitution. You were made to hear this
[1:10:16] kind of word.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; People hear these kind of things and it
[1:10:19] is far too strong for them. But when you
[1:10:23] hear it, that's why many come in even
[1:10:24] into this church, come here and listen
[1:10:27] to the word and hear the preaching says,
[1:10:28] "Wow, you know, whoa, that's intense.
[1:10:31] That is too strong for me." and they're
[1:10:33] and and they're out of here.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; But you sit here and you say, "Give me
[1:10:38] more.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; I want to hear that."
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Because you have that kind of you're
[1:10:43] predestinated
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; to hear that voice.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; You're predestinated to hear what that
[1:10:49] voice said.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; It says in Zechariah 7:11, going back
[1:10:58] just to the first point, "And they
[1:10:59] refused to hearken. They pulled away the
[1:11:02] shoulder and stopped their ears that
[1:11:04] they should not hear. And in Acts 28 and
[1:11:07] 27, for the heart of this people is
[1:11:09] waxed gross and their eyes their ears
[1:11:12] are dull of hearing. Notice their hearts
[1:11:15] waxed gross first and their eyes their
[1:11:19] ears are dull of hearing. And that's why
[1:11:21] brother Brandham even speaks to the
[1:11:23] people. He said, "You've heard so much."
[1:11:25] But we don't want to just have heard so
[1:11:26] much. We want to digest what we hear. We
[1:11:30] want to assimilate it. We want it to
[1:11:32] become f some of the fabric of our
[1:11:34] being, our spiritual being. Not just
[1:11:37] come to church, young people, you put
[1:11:40] this on. This is a garment. This is
[1:11:42] something that is it's actual. It's
[1:11:45] reality. It's not just words that go in
[1:11:47] here and come out here or or just rotate
[1:11:50] around, grab it, you know, gyate around
[1:11:53] in your mind. That's not what it's for.
[1:11:54] It'll do something to you. These are not
[1:11:57] just a words out of a Bible school. his
[1:11:58] words out of a prophet's mouth that came
[1:12:00] from God, thus sayith the Lord. And and
[1:12:03] and if that word could say, "Let there
[1:12:05] be lights." And there was lights, he can
[1:12:07] say, "Let there be a son of God." And
[1:12:08] there will be a son of God.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; And if he can wait for millions of years
[1:12:12] for that, he can wait a few days for
[1:12:14] you.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; He's got faith in his word.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; He knows that thing that needs to be
[1:12:19] changed will be changed.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said it and he will have
[1:12:24] it.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Isn't that wonderful?
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to have that kind of that
[1:12:31] kind of God that created. He spoke to
[1:12:33] his creation. When he's speaking to you,
[1:12:36] you're part of his creation. The reason
[1:12:38] I started out the way I did is to let
[1:12:40] you know that it's not God's not
[1:12:42] speaking just uh on a on a verbal or an
[1:12:45] audible way to get into your eard drums
[1:12:49] and to get into your mind and to get
[1:12:51] down to your soul. He has another way.
[1:12:53] He can also speak directly to your soul.
[1:12:56] Amen.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; You begin to feel something.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; I was just thinking, you know, here
[1:13:02] comes a vindicated prophet of God where
[1:13:05] pillar of fire has uh been pictured over
[1:13:08] him. Pillar fire between the people. I'm
[1:13:11] speaking through the pillar of fire. Yet
[1:13:12] in such simplicity, he goes out of a
[1:13:16] morning out of his hotel room to mail a
[1:13:20] postcard.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:22] And while he goes out to mail the
[1:13:24] postcard, he hears a he hears just
[1:13:26] something inside like a little voice
[1:13:28] like you've all heard it.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Keep walking.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Keep walking.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Two words. Keep walking.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; So there's a big policeman there on the
[1:13:38] corner. So he goes he he related this to
[1:13:41] me also. He goes to a store window. They
[1:13:44] weren't open. They were kind of dark.
[1:13:46] And he just looked in the store window
[1:13:48] and he said, "Father, is that you?
[1:13:52] And God didn't give a great glorious
[1:13:54] vision and saw flashes of lightning and
[1:13:56] thunder. No, he just kept hearing that
[1:13:58] same thing inside. Keep walking. So he
[1:14:01] went to the edge of the sidewalk. Keep
[1:14:03] walking. So you just start across. Keep
[1:14:06] walking. Now isn't that profound?
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; I just said to my wife driving here
[1:14:16] tonight, I said, you know, she says,
[1:14:18] "Well, the same thing happens to us." I
[1:14:20] said, "Yeah, but it's just not so
[1:14:22] fantastic,
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; you know, when it happens to him." Then
[1:14:25] something outstanding happens. And uh
[1:14:29] and and then he ends up The end result
[1:14:31] of that is he keeps walking and there's
[1:14:34] a there's a colored woman waiting for
[1:14:36] him. She's all wet with dew from the
[1:14:38] night, leaning over the fence.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Morning, Parson.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; He's already gone past her. Excuse me. H
[1:14:48] how do you know? Do you know me? No,
[1:14:50] sir. Said, I don't know you.
[1:14:53] But she knew he was coming.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; He said, you're supposed to have a a val
[1:14:57] briefcase. He said, I left it in the
[1:14:59] hotel.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; That's what I saw you carrying.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; I was back in the hotel.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; And then she's been praying for him.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Do you ever hear me? My name's William
[1:15:10] Brandom. No, I never heard of you.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible?
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Keep walking. Keep walking. and a and a
[1:15:17] boy gets saved,
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; gets healed,
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; and becomes, I believe, Sunday school
[1:15:23] teacher or something.
[1:15:25] We never know.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; You're waiting for some great enormous
[1:15:33] voice and maybe it's just something
[1:15:35] inside.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; I got up this last Saturday morning
[1:15:40] and I said, I didn't say anything. I
[1:15:42] just said and I kept pushing it out and
[1:15:45] I just had like a little voice you you
[1:15:48] know you should maybe go and pick up
[1:15:49] brother you know go and meet brother
[1:15:52] Murphy at the airport and I thought well
[1:15:54] I'd like to you know and I don't know if
[1:15:56] I can or not and then and then we had
[1:15:59] things to do and you know wife's got
[1:16:02] plans and I got plans and and and then I
[1:16:05] was always kind of edgy throughout the
[1:16:07] day in case something crowded that out
[1:16:08] and I thought well if it works out we'll
[1:16:10] go and uh but I kept trying to push
[1:16:13] things around and manipulate things so
[1:16:15] that I would be able to go. Finally, I
[1:16:17] said to her in the afternoon, I'd like
[1:16:19] to, you know, go to the airport and uh
[1:16:22] meet brother Murphy,
[1:16:25] you know, if we are able to do that.
[1:16:28] And well, I think Sister Tracy's going
[1:16:30] to pick him up. I said, "Oh, I know, but
[1:16:31] I I said I feel like I want to be
[1:16:33] there."
[1:16:35] So, anyway, we went early. We went a
[1:16:38] little bit early about 5 to plane wasn't
[1:16:42] coming in until 7:30. We said, "Well,
[1:16:43] he's got the customs. He's got the
[1:16:45] immigration
[1:16:46] baggage. Waiting for the baggage. He
[1:16:48] won't be out till 8:00."
[1:16:51] And so,
[1:16:53] uh, I just said, "No, I I really want to
[1:16:55] go." So, we got in a car and boom, away
[1:16:57] we went down the road. And we were there
[1:16:59] at about 20 after. It takes about 25
[1:17:02] minutes from my house, just no traffic,
[1:17:04] no nothing. and and walked into the
[1:17:07] airport
[1:17:09] and I just walked in and my wife says,
[1:17:12] "Now we want to stand back." So we're I
[1:17:15] was looking for Sister Tracy. We want to
[1:17:17] stand back. Doesn't this sound profound?
[1:17:22] So we want to stand back. We want to see
[1:17:24] his wife hasn't seen him for two months.
[1:17:27] Want to let her be able to greet him. We
[1:17:29] don't want to be, you know, involved in
[1:17:31] that private moment.
[1:17:34] So we were kind of pulling back a wee
[1:17:36] bit and here come this brother walking
[1:17:38] up to me said you looking for a Chinese
[1:17:40] man. Brother Murphy,
[1:17:44] what are you doing here? This is only
[1:17:46] this is only 20 7. You're supposed to be
[1:17:49] back in there. The plane's not supposed
[1:17:50] to be here for we even called and they
[1:17:54] said the plane is due at 7:30. So he
[1:17:57] said we know they told us on the
[1:17:59] internet you're going to be here at
[1:18:01] 7:30. No, he says, "We got here at 5 to
[1:18:03] 7 and I was already through the
[1:18:06] immigration's nothing. I just, you know,
[1:18:08] I just waved my uh my passport and I was
[1:18:11] out of here at 10 after 7. He'd been
[1:18:14] there for 10 minutes." And I said,
[1:18:16] "Well, is Sister Tracy, is she here?"
[1:18:19] "No." He said, "She just left the
[1:18:21] house."
[1:18:23] He said, "I just phoned her. She just
[1:18:25] left the house." I said, "Well, call
[1:18:27] her. We'll take you." No, no, no. He
[1:18:30] said, "She's coming. she's coming. And I
[1:18:32] said, "Well, call her. Find out where
[1:18:33] she's at." So he called her just a
[1:18:36] couple minutes. "No, she just left the
[1:18:38] house. She's in Suriri." I said, "Well,
[1:18:40] just tell her to stay and we'll just
[1:18:41] take you." And Sister Tracy's house was
[1:18:45] full of people and everything and we got
[1:18:48] to have him in the car and I I just felt
[1:18:51] a great privilege. And you know what? It
[1:18:53] couldn't have been it couldn't have been
[1:18:56] better because if if you'd have tried to
[1:19:00] schedule everything, the schedule was
[1:19:02] God's schedule. And while it was
[1:19:03] happening, we realized, you know, this
[1:19:05] is God's schedule.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; And then we were able to, you know, take
[1:19:09] him home and meet the family and go in
[1:19:13] ourselves and have supper.
[1:19:19] Not because we wanted it. We were forced
[1:19:21] to eat. You know, you all know what
[1:19:23] that's like.
[1:19:25] All right. But, you know, it's just a
[1:19:27] little thing, but I really think God
[1:19:31] said, "My servant has been laboring
[1:19:35] all these weeks." I asked Brother
[1:19:38] Murphy, "How many messages did you
[1:19:39] preach?" He said, "I I don't know." He
[1:19:42] said, "Probably 30 in the last month."
[1:19:46] That's a lot of services.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; That's a lot of services. And God has
[1:19:52] always had, you know, he's had a special
[1:19:54] place. Someone that's been laboring and
[1:19:57] giving themselves. You know what he
[1:19:58] probably said? I'm I'm just going to
[1:20:00] arrange that, you know, Brother Ed and
[1:20:03] Sister Ruth just have nothing to do and
[1:20:05] they jump in their car and just whisk
[1:20:07] right off to the airport and pick my
[1:20:09] servant up.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Well, anyway, I'll be like, "Brother
[1:20:16] Garald anyway." He He's blessed by it.
[1:20:19] I'm blessed by it. Amen.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; So the famine comes not only will those
[1:20:26] not hear but those that would hear like
[1:20:30] the scripture says woe unto you lawyers
[1:20:32] for you have taken away the key of
[1:20:35] knowledge.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; You entered not in yourselves and them
[1:20:40] that were entering you hindered.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; That spirit is still here.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Not in this church but it's here. There
[1:20:47] are those that will not enter. Ministry
[1:20:51] theologians won't enter and do
[1:20:54] everything in their power to see that
[1:20:55] you don't enter.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; How many have experienced that?
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[1:21:04] Ken raised his hand. I remember when
[1:21:07] when he first came and he he didn't know
[1:21:10] a whole lot about the Bible, but it was
[1:21:13] arranged, I believe, by his parents that
[1:21:15] he would go and see a very very
[1:21:18] dignified
[1:21:20] white-haired old man. Doesn't mean that
[1:21:22] everybody's white-haired is dignified,
[1:21:23] but anyway.
[1:21:26] And uh he was a, you know, retired
[1:21:28] minister of the church where Ken went to
[1:21:31] and played the organ and so on. And uh
[1:21:36] so
[1:21:38] he knows that he's kind of got into a
[1:21:40] rad some radical stuff. Says now Cam,
[1:21:44] you know that we can't take the Bible
[1:21:47] literal.
[1:21:50] For example, it says that the prophet
[1:21:53] Elijah, Elisha, I don't remember which
[1:21:55] one, but he says for example, the
[1:21:58] prophet made the axe head float.
[1:22:01] Ken, we know that steel doesn't float.
[1:22:07] Ken had never heard that before. He
[1:22:10] didn't know, but all he knew is if the
[1:22:12] Bible said that, he believed it floated.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Well, one thing," he said,
[1:22:18] "Uh, if the Bible," he didn't know it
[1:22:20] was in the Bible, but he said, "If the
[1:22:22] Bible says that, I believe it. I believe
[1:22:25] it floated."
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; And he said he doesn't even know how it
[1:22:28] happened, but he found himself out in
[1:22:29] the front porch.
[1:22:31] just happened that fast
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; and he was already out the door.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; They have the key.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; that lots of these leaders knew the
[1:22:42] truth.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; That's why they kept having the prophet
[1:22:45] come because they knew they wanted the
[1:22:47] sign. They wanted the sign to happen,
[1:22:50] but they didn't want to hear the voice
[1:22:52] of the sign.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to come to that.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:22:57] in spiritual food and due season. He
[1:22:58] says, "Now, we all know, we're all very
[1:23:01] aware that there is a great spiritual
[1:23:03] drought in the land today." Doesn't say
[1:23:05] it was coming. This 65 and then it's in
[1:23:08] the land today. Speaking and you know
[1:23:12] that was predicted by the prophets just
[1:23:14] before the second coming of Jesus of the
[1:23:16] of the Christ would be there. He said,
[1:23:18] "There will come a famine in the land
[1:23:20] and it won't be for bread alone, but
[1:23:21] it'll be for hearing the word of God and
[1:23:24] that day is now.
[1:23:27] hearing the true word of God. Now this
[1:23:30] types the natural drought with the
[1:23:32] spiritual sin and unbelief by false
[1:23:35] teachers and modernists in the church
[1:23:38] had brought had brought the place to
[1:23:41] this coming oncoming judgment and then
[1:23:44] they had turned from God's word and his
[1:23:47] prophet to a modern theological terms of
[1:23:51] the word. Right.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; And he goes on in Amos 8:11 where we
[1:23:55] read where it is said that there would
[1:23:57] come a famine not for bread uh or water
[1:24:00] but for the hearing of the word of God
[1:24:02] and that people would go from sea to sea
[1:24:05] from east to west and and to and fro
[1:24:08] everywhere seeking to for the word of
[1:24:10] God and fail to find it. If that don't
[1:24:14] fit this nation at this time
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; now he was saying that in ' 65. if that
[1:24:20] don't fit that nation at the time.
[1:24:22] Listen friends, we've had lots of bread,
[1:24:25] lots of water, a lot of those things,
[1:24:29] but there has been a drought
[1:24:31] and we're living in the midst of it. You
[1:24:33] talk about a spiritual drought.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that?
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; And he said there's
[1:24:42] we don't need bread. We got plenty of
[1:24:45] it. We got plenty to eat, plenty clothes
[1:24:48] to wear, nice homes to live in, and
[1:24:51] everything. But there's a famine for the
[1:24:54] hearing of the word of God. A man won't
[1:24:58] know what to believe.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; A man won't know. A person doesn't know
[1:25:04] what to believe. And that's created a
[1:25:06] famine because there's every kind of a
[1:25:08] doctrine, every kind of an idea, every
[1:25:10] kind of an opinion,
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; every kind of a teaching, all kinds of
[1:25:14] preaching, every kind of if you want it
[1:25:16] glitzy or if you want it very stayed and
[1:25:19] stoic, however you want it. If you
[1:25:21] wanted an a man or if you want people
[1:25:23] climbing all over the place, however you
[1:25:25] want it, you can have it. But that
[1:25:27] created a famine because people didn't
[1:25:29] know what to believe.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they didn't believe
[1:25:34] anything.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; So I'm confused. I don't know what to
[1:25:37] believe.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; And that created the famine.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; John 1 and1. And he came to his own.
[1:25:45] Follow me closely now. I'm going to just
[1:25:47] try and hold it right down. He came to
[1:25:49] his own and his own received him not.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; But John 10 and 27 says, "My sheep
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; hear my voice."
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; And I know them. Amen.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; And they follow me.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; That happens to be absolute.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; He came to his own. His own received him
[1:26:11] not.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; But in the same book by the same writer,
[1:26:14] he he speaks my sheep. These are his own
[1:26:17] words. My sheep know my voice.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; And conjunction word, they I know them.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? It isn't just you
[1:26:29] have to know him, but he knows you.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; And they follow me.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Not the preaching only, but they follow
[1:26:36] me.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; The voice of the sign. Now in the in the
[1:26:42] scripture the voice that refers to the
[1:26:44] voice of the sign in the Old Testament
[1:26:46] which God spoke to Moses in Exodus that
[1:26:49] voice that voice the word there is
[1:26:52] actually a thunder or thunderings or
[1:26:56] it's used also for proclamation
[1:26:58] something but almost always it is the
[1:27:01] voice throughout the Old Testament but
[1:27:03] it when you when you have the uh uh when
[1:27:07] you have the thought that it is a a
[1:27:09] thunder. Uh it's thunderings. It's a
[1:27:12] proclamation. It's a powerful statement.
[1:27:15] And it shall come to pass if they will
[1:27:18] not believe thee.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; If you will, if they will not believe
[1:27:23] you, Moses,
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; you're the one that's speaking.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; They hear your vocal cords, but they
[1:27:29] won't believe that. Right?
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "And if they won't believe
[1:27:33] thee, neither hearken to the voice of
[1:27:35] the first sign,
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; they will believe the voice of the
[1:27:39] latter sign
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; because God was going to uh keep
[1:27:43] enforcing it and intensifying it until
[1:27:47] they would have to believe it
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; and believe it so much they'd ask him to
[1:27:50] go."
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; But it literally thundered to them.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; And the opening of the seals was in
[1:27:58] seven thunders. that voice
[1:28:02] they so that you understand even people
[1:28:04] got caught up in it and so on and so
[1:28:06] forth and maybe uh uh maybe turned
[1:28:09] others so they became uh afraid to speak
[1:28:12] about it. I'm not afraid to speak about
[1:28:13] anything he spoke about. He said the
[1:28:16] seven thunders are the seven voices
[1:28:18] under those seven seals.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; And he said if you go to the symbol in
[1:28:22] John's gospel they they heard the people
[1:28:25] heard a thunder,
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; But he heard something else.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; That's right. He heard, "This is my son,
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; my beloved son."
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; He heard specific words that were
[1:28:35] articulated to him.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul, the men fell to the ground
[1:28:42] because they they saw the great light.
[1:28:46] But not only did he see a great light
[1:28:48] and they heard a voice and one place
[1:28:50] that said they didn't hear the voice.
[1:28:52] What they didn't hear, they didn't hear
[1:28:54] the voice articulating the words saying
[1:28:57] something. They heard a sound, but they
[1:29:01] did not hear Saul. Saul, why persecutest
[1:29:05] thou me? That was the message from the
[1:29:08] Lord Jesus to him.
[1:29:12] Maybe you're sitting beside somebody or
[1:29:14] someone else in your family or some
[1:29:16] friend when God spoke to you and smoked
[1:29:19] you with conviction.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; They weren't convicted. They don't know
[1:29:23] what you're doing.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; I know two young men in Singapore and
[1:29:27] the one and one was invited to go to see
[1:29:31] the film Deep Calls to the Deep
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; and and he's in the army. He didn't want
[1:29:36] to go alone. He's kind of afraid, you
[1:29:38] know, and he knew that they were trying
[1:29:40] to convert him. And so he says to his
[1:29:43] buddy, "Hey, I I got to go and see this
[1:29:45] film. Will you go with me?" Yeah, okay,
[1:29:46] fine. I I'm free. I'm all right. So away
[1:29:49] they both go and they're both watching
[1:29:52] at this in Singapore. And the guy who
[1:29:54] just got invited, he was the one who
[1:29:56] became a believer.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he heard a voice
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; articulating to him, "This is for you.
[1:30:06] Hallelujah.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; So the voice of the sign and this there
[1:30:13] there is there is obviously a sound of
[1:30:16] greater intensity
[1:30:19] reaching to the parts of our being not
[1:30:22] connected to the physical hearing.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; If they will not believe thee, they'll
[1:30:29] not believe your voice. They will
[1:30:32] believe the voice of the latter sign.
[1:30:36] The Bible says in Moses and Aaron they
[1:30:38] went in before Pharaoh and I mentioned
[1:30:39] earlier they cast the rod down and
[1:30:42] before Pharaoh and his servants and it
[1:30:44] it became a serpent and then they took
[1:30:46] it up the rather their their
[1:30:50] enchantments and their magicians sent
[1:30:53] theirs down and so on. But now I want to
[1:30:55] go on quickly. Says in Matthew, "For
[1:30:58] this is he, for this is he that was
[1:31:00] spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying,
[1:31:03] the voice of one crying in the
[1:31:05] wilderness." The voice of one crying.
[1:31:09] Please interpret that for me. The voice
[1:31:11] of one crying in the wilderness. Was was
[1:31:14] was John out in the wilderness just
[1:31:17] crying out and creaming out or was it
[1:31:20] referring to his preaching or what was
[1:31:22] it referring to? Well, the Bible says
[1:31:25] the Bible says that the people were they
[1:31:28] were drawn they multitudes came to John
[1:31:33] came to his baptism. Baptism isn't a
[1:31:35] custom in the Old Testament.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; They didn't do baptism. Nobody was
[1:31:40] immersing people in in Jordan. But John,
[1:31:43] he's out there doing some. It wasn't
[1:31:44] just because it was some kind of a
[1:31:46] circus or some kind of a demonstration.
[1:31:49] Well, he's putting people in the water.
[1:31:51] Let's go and see. No, there was
[1:31:53] something he was there was a voice
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; of one crying in the wilderness
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; and the people were drawn to this to
[1:32:02] this man to this ministry. There was
[1:32:05] something that was uh special about him
[1:32:08] and perhaps they couldn't even explain
[1:32:09] it.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; But to many of them there was no
[1:32:12] articulation of the word. Many came and
[1:32:15] were baptized. Many did not come.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; You might wonder where I'm going and
[1:32:21] that's fine. That's fine. But I hope it
[1:32:23] makes enough sense to you. So we just
[1:32:25] carry on. And so the voice of one crying
[1:32:28] in the wilderness prepared the way. And
[1:32:30] then Jesus came on the scene immediately
[1:32:33] following that. And John introduced him.
[1:32:37] And and Jesus said
[1:32:40] to the disciples, he said to two, and
[1:32:43] the Bible says this, and Jesus, now get
[1:32:46] the scene, please. Now, in this
[1:32:48] generation, a man, William Brandam, is
[1:32:50] walking out in the sidewalk says,
[1:32:52] "Follow me. Follow me." You know, you
[1:32:54] know, just keep walking, keep walking,
[1:32:56] keep walking. 2,000 years ago, a man was
[1:33:00] just walking. A man was just walking
[1:33:03] along the seashore and there's two
[1:33:06] fishermen and the Bible says they were
[1:33:08] casting their net
[1:33:10] into the sea.
[1:33:13] Now, that's not profound.
[1:33:16] That's not startling.
[1:33:18] And the man is walking. This man is
[1:33:21] called Jesus of Nazareth.
[1:33:23] And he sees two brethren, two brothers,
[1:33:27] Simon, called Peter and Andrew, his
[1:33:29] brother, casting a net into the sea,
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; for they were fishers. And he saith unto
[1:33:36] them, "Follow me, and I will make you
[1:33:40] fishers of men." and they straightway or
[1:33:43] immediately they immediately left their
[1:33:47] net
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; and followed him.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just the audible words, come
[1:33:53] and follow me
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; and I'll make you fishers of men.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; I am absolutely am convinced there was
[1:34:00] something that was deep within
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; calling for something and they somehow
[1:34:05] that it made a connection.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; This is the time. This is what I've
[1:34:11] looked for.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; There's just something about this
[1:34:14] moment.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Friends,
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; you had that.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; We all had that. We became a believer.
[1:34:23] It became our moment.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; It was the It was the transforming
[1:34:27] moment. It was the defining moment of
[1:34:29] our lives. Everything changed from that
[1:34:32] day forward. Is that not so?
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; This one, there was something. Now, now
[1:34:40] you'll know why I read earlier out of
[1:34:43] Genesis, starting at the beginning of
[1:34:45] Genesis. It was the creator.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; I'll say it again. It was the creator.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; For all things were made with by him and
[1:34:55] without him was nothing made that is
[1:34:57] made.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; God
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; was in Christ.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; God who said, "Let there be light." And
[1:35:05] there was. God who spoke to the waters.
[1:35:08] God who spoke to the to the air to the
[1:35:11] planets. God who spoke to the earth. God
[1:35:15] was now speaking to the earth in another
[1:35:17] form.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Men,
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; fishermen.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; God speaking, the creator speaking to
[1:35:24] his creation.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Come.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Come follow me.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; I'll make you fishers of men. And that
[1:35:34] and that earth which was part of its
[1:35:36] creation could do nothing different than
[1:35:38] it did in the beginning. It had to
[1:35:40] respond
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; and it had to respond immediately
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; because he was there. He was moving and
[1:35:50] they left their net,
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; left their father. Others left their
[1:35:53] father and went immediately and followed
[1:35:56] him.
[1:35:58] [Music]
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; What do you think about it?
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Whatever form it was in, doesn't matter
[1:36:06] whether it was Peter or Andrew
[1:36:09] or Ed Biscll
[1:36:12] or you
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; when God spoke
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; and he's the one who said you're going
[1:36:18] to come.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; I'm the creator
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; and you're a part of this earth
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; and I'm calling for you to come.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God.
[1:36:38] So many things he said so many things.
[1:36:41] There are so many things in the message.
[1:36:42] Hear his voice. So many things to dull
[1:36:45] the senses of the people today.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; So I want you to think about our
[1:36:50] environment now for a moment
[1:36:53] because I am convinced that God speaks
[1:36:58] perhaps more than we're able to hear.
[1:37:01] Amen.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; And there are things that can dull our
[1:37:06] hearing.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; And he said that it dulls the senses of
[1:37:11] the people today. Oh, but in the midst
[1:37:13] of all that, in spite of everything
[1:37:16] dulling in every voice that's in the
[1:37:18] world today, some of them are pleasure
[1:37:21] voices, some of them are sinful voices
[1:37:24] to lure the people. But in the spite,
[1:37:27] and I want you to get this, in the
[1:37:29] spite, in spite of every bit of that,
[1:37:32] the truth of God still remains.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; He that will hear my voice and come
[1:37:42] after me. Men and women who will hear
[1:37:45] the voice of God, God still waits to
[1:37:47] speak to every individual that'll open
[1:37:50] their ears to hear God's voice.
[1:37:54] And Jesus said,
[1:37:57] "Everyone that is of the truth heareth
[1:38:01] my voice."
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; There can't be a single one
[1:38:04] predestinated to the truth without
[1:38:07] hearing his voice.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; And it isn't that you just get blessed
[1:38:10] in a service, whether you understand it
[1:38:12] or don't understand it. God can speak to
[1:38:14] you after you've left here.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; God can speak to you tomorrow while your
[1:38:19] sisters are in the house or your men are
[1:38:21] working or wherever you are. God can
[1:38:23] speak to you. Just come in a moment at
[1:38:25] time.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; But I'm speaking tonight that you'll be
[1:38:28] more aware,
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; that you'll be more alerted,
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; that you will have a consciousness, an
[1:38:33] awareness of his presence, this God. You
[1:38:37] can never escape him. Friends, he's
[1:38:39] there. He fills all time and space. When
[1:38:41] you move around tomorrow, just remember
[1:38:43] the air around you is filled with the
[1:38:45] God that's in you.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; That's absolutely the truth. Amen.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Now he said now before we close this
[1:38:56] section, this is in the Leodysan church
[1:38:58] age. He said we must seriously consider
[1:39:01] these two thoughts. First this age will
[1:39:04] have one prophet messenger. Revelation
[1:39:06] 10:7 which he singular shall begin to
[1:39:10] sound. And then brother Brandham goes
[1:39:11] through a number of messengers and it
[1:39:14] was one Noah one Moses one. And then he
[1:39:17] says on the basis of human behavior
[1:39:19] alone, listen everybody, on the basis of
[1:39:23] human behavior alone, anyone knows that
[1:39:26] where there are many people, there is
[1:39:29] even divided opinion on lesser points.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Now if we took a single subject here,
[1:39:37] some might think it's good. No, I don't
[1:39:39] think it's good. You'll have a whole
[1:39:40] variety of ideas and opinions. That's
[1:39:44] why I say to people, whatever you do,
[1:39:46] don't seek advice
[1:39:49] even from good intending people.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Don't seek advice. First, I said to
[1:39:53] brother Dio once, what do you do with
[1:39:55] all these thousands of people and have
[1:39:57] all of these maybe questions and I spend
[1:40:00] a lot of time counseling. What do you do
[1:40:02] with a 68,000 people? He said, I tell
[1:40:04] him to go home and pray. I said, thanks.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he said, "You have
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; I've heard it just in the last two
[1:40:15] weeks.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; I don't know what to do. This one said
[1:40:18] that and that one did that and that one
[1:40:20] said that." I said, "The biggest mistake
[1:40:21] you wasn't that you asked anybody."
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; You should have just kept it to
[1:40:26] yourself.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Go to prayer. Ask God.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; And and and if you have to talk to
[1:40:33] somebody who's not going to say
[1:40:35] anything,
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; and let's hope it's a preacher.
[1:40:41] And he says they have all kinds of
[1:40:42] divided opinion on lesser points of a
[1:40:45] major doctrine which they will all hold
[1:40:47] together. He says who then will have the
[1:40:51] power listen now. Who then
[1:40:55] church those you Cloverdale by the way I
[1:40:57] wish this church was absolutely filled
[1:40:59] this Sunday morning.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Who then will have the power of
[1:41:04] infallibility?
[1:41:06] Infallibility is without error.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Where do we have an absolute?
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Where can we cast our anchor?
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; And once we cast our anchor said, "We're
[1:41:18] done.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; I've cast my anchor. I don't need
[1:41:21] another anchor.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; This is going to hold me.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Through every wind,
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; every storm,
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; I've cast my anchor."
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Where's the power of
[1:41:35] infallibility which is to be restored in
[1:41:39] the last age?
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; It's going to go back to manifesting the
[1:41:44] pure word bride.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; I may not feel like I'm there. You may
[1:41:50] not feel like you're there. God, eternal
[1:41:53] God, has got plenty of time. And not
[1:41:56] that I want to delay it, not that I want
[1:41:59] to uh, you know, make room for our
[1:42:02] errors or mistakes or whatever more, but
[1:42:05] it takes time to mature.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; And if I'm not where I ought to be or
[1:42:09] you're not where you ought to be, don't
[1:42:11] give up.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Cuz God won't give up.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; I say you're going to, if you're an
[1:42:16] elected seed, you're going to come
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; one way or another.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; The easy way or the hard way, but you're
[1:42:24] going to come. All you have to do is
[1:42:26] decide today that you are or you aren't.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; And even if you decide you aren't, God
[1:42:32] might not agree with you.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:36] [Music]
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; He's not afraid of your failures.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; He's not even afraid of your sin. He'll
[1:42:43] just forgive you
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; if you just ask him. He's got the bleach
[1:42:47] waiting
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; for you to drop that drop of ink in it.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He just delights in
[1:42:54] abolishing it.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; He delights in breaking it up so you
[1:42:57] can't find it.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; And you keep looking and the devil keeps
[1:43:01] looking and they can't find it.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; And God sits back and he has a wonderful
[1:43:06] time.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz he's the only one who's
[1:43:09] got that.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Nobody else has got that.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; He just annihilates it.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; He creates something and annihilates
[1:43:20] others.
[1:43:22] Hallelujah.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; And he says about this prophet, he said
[1:43:30] that means we will have the word once
[1:43:32] again as it was. And I'm closing now
[1:43:34] right away.
[1:43:36] He has he'll have the word. It was
[1:43:39] perfectly given and perfectly understood
[1:43:41] in the days of Paul. I will tell you who
[1:43:44] will have it. It will be a prophet as
[1:43:48] thoroughly vindicated or even more
[1:43:52] thoroughly vindicated than was any
[1:43:55] prophet in all the ages. He says from
[1:43:58] Enoch to this day. And you've heard me
[1:44:00] say, and I'm not ashamed of it, and I I
[1:44:02] I don't expect to ever change it.
[1:44:05] There's been no messenger, no prophet
[1:44:07] like this since Adam.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; None. Amen.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; There's never been a record where
[1:44:13] anybody stands up with 40, 50 people in
[1:44:16] front of them tonight and tomorrow night
[1:44:17] and the next night and next night and be
[1:44:19] able to say years later has it ever been
[1:44:22] wrong.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Never been wrong.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, look what you're
[1:44:28] connected to.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; It's infallibility.
[1:44:31] [Applause]
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says he won't need to speak
[1:44:39] for himself.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; God will speak for him by the voice of
[1:44:45] the sign.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; I want you to hear this just very brief
[1:44:49] audio clip. And if it's too loud, that's
[1:44:52] fine.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; I ask for them to make it loud.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Let it boom out here in this auditorium.
[1:44:58] So they're doing the best they can.
[1:45:03] Oh God, my father, I come in Jesus name
[1:45:06] to pray for this people who has now
[1:45:09] honestly and sincerely have confessed
[1:45:12] their wrongs. Oh blessed God, may this
[1:45:16] be a night that they'll never forget.
[1:45:18] May the Holy Spirit come into every
[1:45:20] heart just now and just move out all
[1:45:23] everything and all the sickness from
[1:45:26] their body. I now challenge the devil to
[1:45:29] a debate.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; That's what I like. Satan,
[1:45:34] you are aware that you are whipped.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; You have no legal rights.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, my Lord, stripped you of
[1:45:43] every authority you had when he died at
[1:45:45] Calvary to take away sin and sickness.
[1:45:48] And you're nothing but a bluff.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; And we're calling your blood.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; You know that when our Lord came to the
[1:45:56] tree, he cursed the tree. The next day
[1:45:59] it was withering. And our Lord said to
[1:46:03] his disciples, "Have faith in God."
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; For if ye shall say,
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Ye shall say,
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; "This mountain,
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; be moved."
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Don't doubt in your heart, but believe
[1:46:16] what you have said is coming to pass.
[1:46:19] You can have what you said.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Satan, you know the scripture on that.
[1:46:24] And I've just taught this people that
[1:46:27] God is in them. Yes.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; And if God is in them and they speak to
[1:46:31] that disease and say be away from me and
[1:46:35] don't doubt in their heart right then
[1:46:37] that disease has to move for Christ said
[1:46:40] so. For it's not them that speak. It's
[1:46:43] the father that dwells in them that's
[1:46:45] speaking. They're in need. So come out
[1:46:47] of them in the name of Jesus Christ. I
[1:46:50] say as God's servant by a message from
[1:46:52] an angel who anointed and has proved to
[1:46:54] the people that Jesus is here and the
[1:46:56] message is right. So come out of them in
[1:46:58] the name of Jesus Christ. I adjure you
[1:47:01] to leave every sick person and get into
[1:47:03] outer darkness in the name of the Lord
[1:47:06] Jesus Christ.
[1:47:08] [Music]
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Did you hear that?
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; I'm sure you heard that.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; How many heard that great roar go
[1:47:20] through the building just then?
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; That was it. Yeah.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Surely you won't down any longer.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; That was God speaking back.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Can't you see?
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; God speaking back.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Rise. You believe you're healed?
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; You believe that God answered prayer?
[1:47:44] Raise your hands to him. Thank him for
[1:47:46] it.
[1:47:48] [Music]
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; You're healed. God speaking back.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Maybe the people didn't hear it. God
[1:47:59] heard it.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; God spirit.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; The same God that said, "Let there be
[1:48:04] light."
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; spoke in that building with a roar.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; But in the roar, it wasn't Apostle Paul.
[1:48:11] It wasn't the people with him hearing
[1:48:13] the roar. It was a prophet in the end
[1:48:15] time heard the roar. He said, "Did you
[1:48:18] hear it? That was God speaking."
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; And God said, "You're healed. Amen.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Ricardo, it's not
[1:48:30] 2,000 years ago. It's today.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Lisa, for
[1:48:36] standing. Hallelujah. An act of faith.
[1:48:39] Why not have it?
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Why not enjoy it? It's here. It's
[1:48:44] available. It's present with us.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; I say glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; It's God that's called you.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; It's God that's called you.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; You're his sons and daughters.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is God's decree.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Don't doubt.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Believe.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Believe.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; With everything that's in you.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So many of the voices, so many of
[1:49:14] the voices, he said the voices of this
[1:49:18] life,
[1:49:21] you know, he said there's voices of
[1:49:23] troubles and voices of problems
[1:49:26] that that
[1:49:29] you don't have to have the problem
[1:49:30] present with you, but it just rotates
[1:49:34] within you.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; You keep hearing it. It's this way and
[1:49:38] that way and how am I going to overcome?
[1:49:41] How am I going to handle this one?
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; This is so complex. This is so involved.
[1:49:46] Involves that person, this person, that
[1:49:49] brother, this brother. You got to cast
[1:49:52] it down.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have to cast it down.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; You know, we're not going to fix it.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; The main thing is that God's voice
[1:50:02] speaks to you. Imagine all that crowd of
[1:50:04] people that was there. I have another.
[1:50:06] There's another one where the roar is
[1:50:09] incredible and it just roars through the
[1:50:11] building. And brother Benam says says,
[1:50:13] "On the day of Pentecost, there came a
[1:50:15] great wind and that wind blows right
[1:50:18] through that building at that time.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; It's much louder than even this,
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; that same one."
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; That spoke that
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; that same God
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; hasn't changed one iota. Amen.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; It's us that change and us is get we get
[1:50:35] all uh uh what do I say? We get weighted
[1:50:39] down.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; We become weary. Our minds can only
[1:50:42] handle so much.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Let's cast all of our burden on him.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; For he carth for you.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:53] When I think of God that creates the
[1:50:56] heavens and the planets and all of these
[1:50:59] things,
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; you think that he's not mindful of us.
[1:51:02] In fact, it's I think it's a sin. It's
[1:51:05] wrong for us to become so completely
[1:51:08] overwhelmed with things of this life
[1:51:11] that we can't possibly even uh uh you
[1:51:14] know give him the place of honor that he
[1:51:16] deserves.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; I believe how great is our God.
[1:51:20] How great is his name?
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Will you join me?
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Let's have the musicians.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Let's sing praises to him.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; The world isn't going to do it.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Your school isn't going to do it out
[1:51:37] there. The school of the world, our
[1:51:39] school would, but the business place,
[1:51:42] you're not going to hear this in the
[1:51:43] shopping mall.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; So, let us let us give glory to God.
[1:51:48] You're going to go in a restaurant and
[1:51:49] hear some great thumping demonic music.
[1:51:52] Let's make music that God, this God will
[1:51:55] enjoy.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Let's gladden the heart of our father.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's stand together.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; How great is our God.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Turn this music up.
[1:52:16] I want to fill this place and rattle the
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; beams.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Help me sing. Brother Derek,
[1:52:26] if you can't sing, make a make a sound,
[1:52:29] a joyful noise. We're not here today to
[1:52:33] end this on a down note,
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; quiet note.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; I hear you kids. Hey, you fellas. I hear
[1:52:39] you out on there on the yard bouncing a
[1:52:42] ball. I want to hear you make more noise
[1:52:45] praising God than bouncing a ball.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; If you think that this is bad, you don't
[1:52:56] want to go to heaven
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; cuz I'm going to be in heaven. I'm going
[1:52:59] to make a lot more noise. I'm making
[1:53:01] down here.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; As soon as you crossed over, I tell you
[1:53:08] what, we're going to be a bunch of
[1:53:09] fanatics. Amen.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; I can't be I can't be tempted anymore. I
[1:53:14] can't have a bad thought anymore. Can't
[1:53:16] have a bad feeling anymore. Is that all
[1:53:18] right, Tyler?
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; It's okay.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; We're going to be there. You'll be a
[1:53:22] fanatic, too.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; All right, let's sing it. Uh, how great
[1:53:28] is our God?
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; How great is our God?
[1:53:34] How great is his name?
[1:53:38] He's the greatest
[1:53:43] forever.

[1:55:42] and
[1:55:45] you
[1:55:47] put your trust in me.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:54] I've been singing a song all day today
[1:55:56] and I had already determined before I
[1:55:58] came to church I wanted to sing it at
[1:55:59] the end of the service. Fill my way
[1:56:02] every day with love.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; I think it's one of Billy Paul's
[1:56:06] favorite songs.
[1:56:08] Heard him I heard him wanting to sing it
[1:56:10] or sang it once. Let me walk blessed
[1:56:14] Lord. We'll start there. Heat. Heat.

[1:58:57] to the course, I want everybody turn
[1:58:59] around, shake hands with as many as you
[1:59:00] can. Give that nice smile. You've been
[1:59:03] smiling through this service.
[1:59:06] Hallelujah.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I said,
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; "Praise the Lord." Amen.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; We got a wonderful guide, wonderful
[1:59:15] savior.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. A creator.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; He spoke to your earth.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Said, "You're going to come forth
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; in a different form."
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not just a human. You're
[1:59:28] going to come forth a son of God.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; A daughter of God. I sent a message to
[1:59:33] change you.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; And that's just the beginning.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to change your atoms.
[1:59:40] You're going to come in another body.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; And to prove it to you, I got a
[1:59:47] theophony right beside you.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; You're going to take a step and step
[1:59:51] into it.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; You talk about a veil. This one here,
[1:59:59] the devil can get at. He can get in this
[2:00:02] flesh and he can do all kinds of things.
[2:00:03] He gets in this mind. He gets in all
[2:00:05] this emotional realm.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Lies to us all the time.
[2:00:10] tells us that, you know, things are
[2:00:11] good, then tells us things are bad, all
[2:00:13] kinds of things,
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; but he won't be able to do a thing once
[2:00:18] you step into that one.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:00:23] Soon the rain will be allowed.
[2:00:30] [Applause]
[2:00:35] [Music]

[2:02:54] Brother Kyle.
[2:02:57] Hallelujah.
[2:03:01] [Music]
[2:03:03] I tell you, this brother's got a voice.
[2:03:05] Brother Kyle, he's got a voice. He was
[2:03:07] up there hunting.
[2:03:10] He and Brother Dave, they went down to
[2:03:11] the boat just down the hill about 100 ft
[2:03:14] from the camp. What do you know? There's
[2:03:17] a moose standing right there in the
[2:03:18] water.
[2:03:20] First thing I heard was kaboom, kaboom,
[2:03:23] you know. Then I hear this man's voice.
[2:03:27] I mean, he sounded more than this
[2:03:28] loudspeaker.
[2:03:30] He yelled, "Moose, bring guns."
[2:03:35] And I said, "Uh, I said to brother Sam,"
[2:03:37] I said, "That's just exactly the way he
[2:03:40] preaches.
[2:03:41] Just says right to the point, move,
[2:03:44] bring guns." Then he came up, he said,
[2:03:45] "Did you hear me?" I said, "Hear you?" I
[2:03:49] thought you had lifted up the tent were
[2:03:51] yelling under the tent.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Well, now I'm glad that brother Kyle God
[2:03:57] changed his tune
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; from the days of the world and all the
[2:04:01] excitement of the basketball and all the
[2:04:04] rest of it. He's in a different game.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; The game of eternity,
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; giving his life to preach the gospel.
[2:04:11] Whatever God has in store for him.
[2:04:12] Brother Kyle, come. Hope you don't mind
[2:04:14] me with that little person.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:04:19] [Music]
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Say blessing all the people.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, let's pray together.
[2:04:24] Lord Jesus, it's it's so obvious. It's
[2:04:26] been good to be here tonight. Lord,
[2:04:28] you've spoken to us to our hearts. Lord
[2:04:30] Jesus, I believe everyone from the
[2:04:31] youngest to the oldest can go home.
[2:04:33] Lord, thankful that you spoke to our
[2:04:36] hearts, Lord Jesus. It's just been a
[2:04:37] it's been a special evening, oh God.
[2:04:39] It's just I I appreciate it, Lord, how
[2:04:41] you talk to me so personally, Lord. And
[2:04:43] Lord, we thank you for that. Thank you
[2:04:44] for all the good things you're doing for
[2:04:46] us, Lord, in our lives, Lord, for
[2:04:48] salvation and so much more. Jesus, thank
[2:04:50] you for this this gathering of people,
[2:04:52] Lord, and for the ministry that you've
[2:04:53] sent by our way to speak to our hearts,
[2:04:55] Lord Jesus. I just pray that you you
[2:04:57] help us now as we go our separate ways,
[2:04:59] Father. Help us meditate on those things
[2:05:01] that you spoke to us personally, Lord
[2:05:02] Jesus. And may they could just grow. And
[2:05:04] Lord, may they just be be able to
[2:05:06] flourish and bring forth fruit in our
[2:05:08] lives, Lord Jesus. We just don't want,
[2:05:10] as brother John was speaking, Lord, the
[2:05:12] water to go inside of us and to flow out
[2:05:14] and be lost, Lord, but may it be able to
[2:05:16] be useful, Lord, and to nourish us and
[2:05:18] to strengthen us, Lord Jesus. We didn't
[2:05:20] just come here in vain or just to spend
[2:05:22] time, Lord, but it was so good to be
[2:05:23] here, Father. Just thank you for it. You
[2:05:26] bless everyone. Keep them safe as they
[2:05:27] go home, Lord, different ones of Seattle
[2:05:29] and help us, Lord, be prepared for the
[2:05:31] events tomorrow and the next day, Lord,
[2:05:33] and bring us back safely to on Sunday to
[2:05:35] the service, Lord. We appreciate you in
[2:05:38] Jesus name. Amen.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[2:05:41] brother.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Going to let you go and be dismissed in
[2:05:44] Jesus name and want you to be happy in
[2:05:47] the Lord and believe what you heard
[2:05:49] tonight. Will you do that? Drive safe on
[2:05:52] the road and Lord willing, we'll see you
[2:05:54] Friday night. If not Friday, we'll see
[2:05:56] you Sunday and be praying for the
[2:05:58] meeting Sunday. Sunday evening, Brother
[2:06:00] Murphy's going to going to speak and and
[2:06:03] tell you about what's been happening.
[2:06:05] And I know he won't be able to cover in
