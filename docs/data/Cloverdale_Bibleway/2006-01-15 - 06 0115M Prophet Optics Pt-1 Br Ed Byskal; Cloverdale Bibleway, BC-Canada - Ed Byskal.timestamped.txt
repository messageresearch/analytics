[13:48] [Music]
[13:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just have a couple of requests
[13:54] here this morning.
[13:58] and uh we just want to bring them before
[14:00] the throne of grace.
[14:02] There's a testimony.
[14:05] Sister Leverne, she said, "I requested
[14:07] prayer for Paris Tuk, I believe in uh
[14:11] April
[14:12] 2005.
[14:14] A horse had fallen on her and broken her
[14:16] back, totally dislodged her pelvic bone.
[14:20] Um
[14:22] just uh 9 months later she had her
[14:25] second surgery to remove the rods and uh
[14:29] she has had a complete healing and
[14:31] recovery. She asked me to thank the
[14:33] saints for your prayers.
[14:36] Always wonderful to hear someone that's
[14:38] been healed and delivered. We want to
[14:41] remember and I'm going to ask brother
[14:42] John Andy's. Brother John, if you'd come
[14:43] this morning, there's a request that we
[14:46] uh pray for sister Lisa St. John's
[14:48] mother, Sister Jean Watkins. She
[14:50] recently had neck surgery and has lost a
[14:52] lot of blood. The doctors are not sure
[14:54] why. The families asked that we pray
[14:56] this morning. Brother Mark and Sister uh
[14:58] Deborah Lowry have an unspoken request
[15:01] this morning. I know there's a lot of
[15:02] needs in our midst. If you've got a
[15:04] need, just lift it before the Lord. If
[15:05] you're listening in on the internet this
[15:06] morning and you've got a need, you just
[15:09] lift it before the Lord as we come
[15:10] before him this morning. Brother John.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just approach him together.
[15:17] [Music]
[15:19] Hallelujah. Lord, we're standing on holy
[15:23] ground
[15:25] and we know there's angels all around.
[15:28] Ministering spirits have been dispatched
[15:30] to this meeting. Your Holy Spirit is
[15:33] present.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; Your spirit is here. Your your throne is
[15:38] open.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; As far as we understand, the door is
[15:42] still open.
[15:45] As far as we know, there's still blood
[15:47] on the mercy seat.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; God, we've gathered around your
[15:51] presence, lifting up holy hands,
[15:55] not because we're holy, but because you
[15:57] have
[15:58] &gt;&gt; desired to live inside of these houses
[16:01] of clay. We lift up our hearts together
[16:04] as a congregation in unity and unison.
[16:08] We look to you. We run into this
[16:13] strong tower, city of refuge.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; We kneel at your feet.
[16:19] &gt;&gt; We feel like the sister in the scripture
[16:21] that when everyone else would not come,
[16:25] they didn't recognize it was you. She
[16:28] came and threw herself at your feet.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; Your prophet said she be to kiss and
[16:33] weeping and under such a spirit of
[16:35] anointing. She was under a spirit of
[16:38] worship. Father, we feel that same
[16:40] atmosphere is in this building. We want
[16:43] to throw ourselves at your feet and cry,
[16:46] "Aba, Father, our father, our husband.
[16:52] Everything that we desire is in you. Our
[16:56] healing is in you, Lord. You are the
[16:58] great physician.
[17:00] You're the one that put this lady's body
[17:02] back together nine months ago when this
[17:05] horse fell on her. Bones put back
[17:08] together, ligaments put back together,
[17:11] muscles put back together. Father, we
[17:13] are your body. You have put us back
[17:15] together, God. Satan thought to crush
[17:18] us, but you have put us back together.
[17:21] Every joint supply, every need supply.
[17:25] We are here for you to do surgery on our
[17:28] lives. Oh God leads among us. Father,
[17:31] Sister Watkins has need there in South
[17:33] Carolina of your touch. Lord, the
[17:36] doctors have tried to put her back
[17:38] together, Lord. But Lord, we know you
[17:40] are the only one that can rightfully do
[17:43] a healing in our bodies.
[17:46] Our families are in need. Congregation
[17:48] is in need. Hands are lifted up. Father,
[17:51] we stand in your presence believing that
[17:54] you're still a God of miracles. You're a
[17:56] God of divine healings. If we can just
[17:59] speak the right word and have the faith,
[18:02] believing all things are possible. Lord,
[18:05] if we can just touch the hymn of your
[18:07] garment, Lord, as you pass by this
[18:09] service this morning, God, I pray that
[18:12] you would visit us especially today,
[18:14] God. unspoken requests, spiritual needs,
[18:19] emotional needs, needs that cannot be
[18:22] spoken out, Lord. But you know the
[18:24] secret of our hearts, Lord. You passed
[18:27] by this generation 40 years ago. You
[18:30] used a man to express yourself. Would
[18:34] you come this morning and express
[18:36] yourself, God?
[18:38] &gt;&gt; You have not changed.
[18:40] Your word is still the same. The pillar
[18:43] of fire is not left. You know the
[18:46] secrets of our hearts. We're a people
[18:48] that has developed under your harvest,
[18:50] son. And we're still listening for the
[18:53] sound of your voice to change these
[18:55] bodies, oh God. And give us a word in
[18:58] due season, the mind of Christ spoken
[19:01] across this altar. Lord, we're judging
[19:04] ourselves this morning.
[19:07] Lord, we know that you closed the door
[19:09] one day in Noah's time and the door was
[19:12] shut.
[19:14] Lord, we don't know when that door is
[19:15] going to be shut.
[19:17] We don't know when mercy is going to
[19:19] end. But I pray this morning you would
[19:21] deal with our souls. Deal with souls of
[19:24] men and women. God, move among us in a
[19:28] special way. Let grace be spoken over
[19:30] this altar. God, over this judgment
[19:33] seat. Let grace be ministered to hearts
[19:36] that are awaiting.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; Bring in lives that are wayward. God,
[19:41] family members that are away. Father,
[19:44] may the token be applied to hearts. God,
[19:47] break us down to nothing. That you would
[19:50] be able to do an eternal work among us.
[19:52] Let us see it happening right here this
[19:54] morning. That you would change lives
[19:56] while we hear your word. that you would
[19:59] break prison bars and go out among us
[20:02] and heal lives that are broken, missing
[20:04] limbs and lives that need a touch.
[20:07] Father, touch us all. Let us respond
[20:10] under your divine presence as it were
[20:13] our last opportunity
[20:15] and we reverence you, Lord. We cherish
[20:18] these moments. We are focused on your
[20:20] presence, believing, Lord, that every
[20:22] syllable and every line, I pray that you
[20:25] would anoint this congregation. Let
[20:27] there be a quickening life among us. Let
[20:30] there be a spirit of liberty and a and a
[20:32] breaking out of your presence. Let us be
[20:35] lost under your shakina glory. That we'd
[20:38] all be under the impact of your
[20:40] nearness. Take control of the minister,
[20:43] our pastor. Lord, let him move in a
[20:45] channel that is so divine that they
[20:48] would so express your heart that we as
[20:50] your people would express deity. also
[20:55] take this meeting under your divine care
[20:57] and reach out Lord into those realms
[20:59] where all things are possible in Jesus
[21:02] name. We thank you for what you're going
[21:05] to do what you're doing already to move
[21:07] our hearts into this place of believing
[21:09] God
[21:11] in Jesus name.
[21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[21:33] got some announcements this morning and
[21:35] uh Sister Florence and a group have a
[21:37] song to sing this morning. If they could
[21:39] come and get ready while we're going
[21:40] through these announcements, appreciate
[21:42] it very much. Um first of all, we want
[21:45] to welcome all those who are visiting
[21:46] with us. We're just real happy to have
[21:48] each and every one of you here this
[21:50] morning and uh and just uh pray that
[21:52] you'd enjoy the service. Um let's be
[21:56] praying for a pastor as well that God
[21:58] just speak through him. Amen. We have uh
[22:03] some uh additions to the assembly.
[22:05] Brother uh Junald and Sister Alda Juno
[22:09] would like to announce the arrival of
[22:12] their baby boy born January the 10th
[22:15] 2006 at 12:07
[22:18] a.m. So he's an early riser
[22:22] 5 lb
[22:24] and n this can't be right. 19 o
[22:28] 16 ounces.
[22:30] Oh well
[22:33] he's not too big.
[22:37] We're thankful that mother and baby are
[22:39] doing well. Um,
[22:43] and also, uh, Brother Jason, Sister
[22:46] Sarah Tagert, would like to announce the
[22:47] arrival of their daughter, Tabitha
[22:50] Briala, born on January the 12th,
[22:53] weighing in at
[22:56] 8 lb 2 oz, and they're they're doing
[22:59] well. So, we're thankful for that. Uh,
[23:01] there's going to be a young people's
[23:03] meeting. Brother John Andy's asked me to
[23:04] announce this Friday night, January the
[23:06] 20th, uh here at the church, 7:30 p.m.
[23:09] And although the young people uh been
[23:11] enjoying those with brother John, so
[23:13] let's be praying. Amen. And and remember
[23:15] to come out to that meeting this this
[23:17] Friday, there's a reminder to parents
[23:19] with children in Sunday school. Sunday
[23:22] school starts when?4
[23:25] to 10.
[23:27] And the reason that uh they're asking me
[23:29] to announce this, I assume, is that some
[23:30] of you are late. So get there on time
[23:33] and uh make sure kids, if you're
[23:36] listening to make sure your parents get
[23:38] out the door on time, don't don't do
[23:39] anything to slow them up. Kids are good
[23:41] at that sometimes. Um and also for
[23:44] parents of this year's graduating class,
[23:47] uh so if you got a child in grade 12
[23:49] this year and they are graduating
[23:52] uh from high school, um and that means
[23:55] that you're almost certain they're going
[23:57] to graduate. Um, there's a meeting in
[24:00] chapel music room after the evening
[24:03] service tonight.
[24:06] Amen.
[24:19] [Music]
[24:35] I was in prison,
[24:39] locked up in chains.
[24:43] Sin held me captive
[24:47] to sorrow
[24:49] and pain.
[24:52] Years of frustration
[24:56] as love passed me by.
[25:00] Until the master
[25:04] heard my heart's cry
[25:10] for grace,
[25:13] marvelous
[25:15] grace.
[25:17] I needed grace
[25:21] to pardon and make me whole.

[26:01] for mercy
[26:03] with nowhere to hide.
[26:08] There was a soulless
[26:12] searching for me
[26:15] with grace ever flowing
[26:19] and it set my soul free.
[26:24] It was grace,
[26:27] marvelous

[27:29] sing.

[27:35] grace,
[27:37] God's
[27:39] grace,
[27:41] grace that will pardon and cleans
[27:47] within

[31:15] I like
[31:18] trampled on the ground.
[31:22] Oh, we took the fall
[31:27] and you
[31:31] my
[31:41] behind
[31:44] You
[31:47] die
[31:56] on the ground.
[32:00] You took the fall
[32:04] and you me
[32:12] above all power
[32:17] above all.
[32:18] [Music]
[32:20] You're above all natur
[32:32] and all the ways of man.
[32:38] For you were here before the world ends.
[32:47] Above
[32:54] all
[32:56] the world
[33:01] and above all
[33:04] and trees of the earth
[33:11] there's no way to And you are my
[33:18] Heat. Heat.
[33:22] [Music]
[33:28] Yeah.
[33:30] Heat.
[33:40] I deserve the fall
[33:45] and I meat.
[34:06] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[34:15] [Applause]
[34:17] You fall
[34:21] and
[34:22] [Music]
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We worship him.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[34:37] &gt;&gt; We love him.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; He loves you.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; That's what's really important. Amen. So
[34:44] happy to be with you this morning and
[34:46] see the church full packed out
[34:51] means you want to come to the house of
[34:53] God.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:55] And we come here for a divine purpose
[34:58] that's give him praise
[35:01] &gt;&gt; that his name might be praised. I've
[35:03] always been so amazed in the scripture
[35:06] how that people suffered.
[35:09] blind man was blind not because anyone
[35:12] sinned said but so that God could be
[35:15] glorified. So we're here for one purpose
[35:19] that he might be glorified.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Not that we can get things or you know
[35:24] get our desires met but that he can be
[35:27] glorified. And however he chooses to do
[35:29] that we say praise God.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to turn to the word uh
[35:37] directly this morning.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Sorry. Thank you. And uh
[35:46] want to take our time with your
[35:49] patience. I'd like to do that.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Are we
[35:53] are we in business?
[35:56] All right. Good. Uh
[36:01] I'm not going to finish the subject this
[36:04] morning. So if you feel when I come to
[36:08] the end I I I'm going to I'm going to
[36:10] speak according to a certain amount of
[36:12] time. When I get to the end, if you kind
[36:14] of feel like you're left hanging, you
[36:16] are.
[36:18] There'll be more to come. And uh if if
[36:22] you don't, you know, don't get to the
[36:23] second service, you won't enjoy this one
[36:25] nearly as much. But uh sometimes we need
[36:28] to, you know, lay quite a bit of
[36:30] groundwork. And uh that doesn't mean
[36:33] that it's boring at all. I think all of
[36:36] the word is exciting.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to read out of Matthew
[36:40] the 13th chapter
[36:47] and going we'll be starting at the 10th
[36:49] verse
[36:51] of chapter 13 Matthew
[36:55] and want to say once again that we are
[36:58] so uh thankful and we so much appreciate
[37:02] all of your prayers
[37:04] uh and the kind words and emails and so
[37:08] on that you have sent our way. I just
[37:11] really really appreciate it. I don't
[37:14] know how to thank you enough just to say
[37:16] that we love you in Christ and uh
[37:21] someday I just pray that God will reward
[37:23] you accordingly. Amen.
[37:26] Appreciate this congregation
[37:28] and what you uh what part you play and
[37:32] everyone plays a part. I wouldn't want
[37:35] you for a moment to think that you sit
[37:38] in this audience and you're obscure and
[37:40] you're not seen and not appreciated and
[37:44] not needed. You are needed and you play
[37:46] an important part. You'll never know
[37:49] until we cross over what part that was,
[37:54] but everyone plays a part. Amen.
[37:57] All right, we'll start to read at the
[37:59] 10th verse.
[38:04] And the disciples came and said unto
[38:06] him,
[38:08] why speakest thou unto them in parables?
[38:10] Now the parable that Jesus had just
[38:14] given them was the famous parable of the
[38:16] swer and the seed.
[38:19] And uh verse 11, and he answered and
[38:22] said unto them, because it is given unto
[38:24] you to know the mysteries of the kingdom
[38:26] of heaven, but to them it is not given.
[38:31] I think we should read that again.
[38:34] And he he they said, "Why do you speak
[38:36] to them in parables?" And he answered,
[38:40] "Because
[38:42] it is given unto you to know the
[38:44] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but
[38:47] to them it is not given."
[38:51] You have to really understand God to
[38:52] understand that scripture. Amen.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; For whosoever hath, to him shall be
[38:58] given, and he shall have more abundance,
[39:02] but whosoever hath not, from him shall
[39:05] be taken away even that he hath.
[39:10] Therefore speak I to them in parables,
[39:13] because they seeing see not, and hearing
[39:17] they hear not, neither do they
[39:20] understand. And in them is fulfilled the
[39:22] prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, "By
[39:26] hearing you shall hear and shall not
[39:28] understand, and seeing you shall see,
[39:32] and shall not perceive. For this
[39:34] people's heart is waxed gross, and their
[39:38] ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes
[39:41] they have closed. Lest at any time they
[39:45] should see with their eyes, and hear
[39:47] with their ears, and should understand
[39:49] with their heart, and should be
[39:52] converted, and I should heal them. But
[39:56] blessed are your eyes, for they see, and
[39:59] your ears, for they hear. For verily I
[40:03] say unto you, that many prophets and
[40:06] righteous men have desired to see those
[40:09] things which you see
[40:11] &gt;&gt; and have not seen them, and to hear the
[40:14] things which you hear and have not heard
[40:17] them.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; I say we are a blessed people.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; God.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow in prayer.
[40:24] Almighty God,
[40:27] gracious and loving heavenly father, we
[40:30] can say this morning, our loving
[40:32] heavenly father, which art in heaven,
[40:36] hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come,
[40:40] and thy will be done on earth as it is
[40:42] in heaven. I pray Lord this morning that
[40:45] as you see this waiting audience here,
[40:48] those that are on the internet, in their
[40:51] rooms, in their buildings, wherever they
[40:54] may be, I pray that the Holy Spirit will
[40:57] surround each individual. Make yourself
[41:00] known to them, Lord. Pray that the word
[41:03] will be quickened. Pray that the speaker
[41:06] will be quickened. Pray that Christ
[41:08] himself will be seen and that he may be
[41:11] the only one glorified.
[41:14] Oh God, you know why we are here to get
[41:17] closer to you. We want to be drawn
[41:20] nearer to you. And so I pray that you
[41:22] will just envelop us somehow, Lord, and
[41:25] draw us into your own bosom, oh God.
[41:28] Make known your will and purpose in our
[41:31] lives, and make us to know the time and
[41:33] the season that we're in. Lord, I pray,
[41:36] Father, you will bless us as we have
[41:38] gathered together in the name of Jesus
[41:41] Christ and for your glory alone. Amen.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[41:50] I have two titles for the service this
[41:53] morning.
[41:54] And uh one that I have been
[41:59] uh I I I've I've had this on in in my
[42:02] notes now for some time and I call it
[42:05] prophet optics
[42:07] and you'll understand it as we as we go
[42:10] through the service but uh I thought to
[42:14] make it more under more understandable
[42:16] to the people
[42:18] uh the subject really will cover looking
[42:22] to the unseen.
[42:24] and the unseen looking to the seen.
[42:28] Going both ways. That means that we
[42:34] humans, we look to the unseen and the
[42:38] invisible God looks to the seen and sees
[42:42] the visible. I want to go into both
[42:45] aspects and I won't manage both this
[42:48] morning but uh it is uh I've been
[42:53] pondering this for quite some time and
[42:56] some of the uh thoughts were actually
[43:00] expressed in brother Mike's service
[43:02] because I was already in that vein and
[43:05] in that channel and I felt that God knew
[43:08] that that I was already in that channel.
[43:11] So I'm not changing anything. There is
[43:14] different kinds of sight in vision.
[43:19] We have sight by our natural eyes
[43:24] which are very limited by the way. Uh we
[43:27] can only see just a certain distance.
[43:31] Uh and what our eyes register to us
[43:35] might not always be accurate.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; You can't believe everything you see. As
[43:40] they say, don't believe everything you
[43:42] hear. You can't believe everything you
[43:43] see either.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; I have fellowshipped with people and
[43:47] they've seen pillars of fire and they've
[43:50] seen doves and they've seen eagles and
[43:53] they've seen all kinds of things, but it
[43:56] didn't register anything on their
[43:57] spiritual life cuz they're out there. I
[43:59] don't know where they are today,
[44:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:01] &gt;&gt; They're as lost and in darkness as they
[44:03] can be. So that whatever vision that was
[44:06] that they saw, they saw literal things,
[44:08] but it didn't do a whole lot for them.
[44:11] And then there is there is insight.
[44:14] There's inner sight or insight that we
[44:18] have by understanding. We learn things.
[44:21] We discover things. And then there are
[44:25] those that had sight by inspiration
[44:29] because even before they saw something,
[44:31] inventors,
[44:33] uh, men who rise into such heights of
[44:37] inspiration, they could see something
[44:39] out there, they can't describe it yet.
[44:42] They can't define it yet, but they see
[44:44] it in in in some fashion. They see it
[44:48] out there, and they just know. I guess
[44:51] Alexander Graham Bell just knew somehow
[44:54] that he could achieve some of these
[44:56] inventions that he uh persisted in and
[45:00] even after failure after failure after
[45:03] failure he persisted because he believed
[45:06] that it was possible somehow had some
[45:09] inspiration that reached out there and
[45:11] said this is possible and I'm going to
[45:14] pursue it till somehow I achieve it and
[45:17] uh so we have sight by that uh uh that
[45:21] kind of inspiration
[45:23] and sight by mental comprehension may
[45:26] not be something we fully understand yet
[45:28] but we we have a mental comprehension of
[45:31] of a certain matter certain subject in
[45:35] the message testimony uh brother
[45:38] Brandham telling the testimony of
[45:39] raising the dead boy says where my faith
[45:43] is based is concerning a gift he's
[45:46] speaking of his faith where my faith is
[45:48] based is concern concerning a gift that
[45:51] was given me.
[45:53] Some people receive a revelation.
[45:57] Some people pick it up out of the word.
[46:02] Some people take it by inspiration. But
[46:05] he said, "Mine is in a vision."
[46:09] And so he says, "When I see those
[46:11] visions happen, there's nothing in the
[46:14] world that can change that." Amen.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; His faith was in that vision because he
[46:20] knew it was supernatural
[46:23] and he knew it was from God.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Now there's people even in the world
[46:28] that have supernatural experiences.
[46:30] Uh it but it may not be it may not be of
[46:34] God. There are supernatural things which
[46:37] are beyond the realm of the natural and
[46:41] it doesn't uh it not necessarily divine
[46:44] or from God. The prophet knew that those
[46:47] visions were from God.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; He could anchor it back in the
[46:52] scripture.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; He knew that there was a message and a
[46:55] messenger to come at this time. So he
[46:58] anchored that back in the scripture and
[47:00] they coordinated together. They linked
[47:02] up and connected together and that gave
[47:05] him a perfect faith in that in that
[47:08] vision.
[47:10] There are also degrees of clarity.
[47:13] Brother, the Lord Jesus prayed for a man
[47:16] and for he was blind and it could he
[47:19] see. He said he saw men as trees. See,
[47:24] and that wasn't enough. And Jesus
[47:26] carried on with him until he could see
[47:28] clear clearly. Now, we have today
[47:33] we've got, you know, in the medical
[47:34] field, they've got the doctor can't see
[47:37] it, but he says, "Well, I'll send you
[47:39] for a CAT scan. I'll send you for an
[47:41] MRI.
[47:43] We'll send you to the to the lab and
[47:45] we'll have some X-rays done, and then
[47:47] they get those negatives and get those
[47:49] pictures and they can see something
[47:52] within your body. There's something
[47:54] there we need to check out." Uh, I had a
[47:57] CAT scan uh when I had the uh the my
[48:02] disc in the my neck herniated and
[48:04] pressed in against the my spinal cord.
[48:08] And so uh sometime later they sent me
[48:10] for a CAT scan. And when I I got the CAT
[48:14] scan, the specialist in uh Vancouver
[48:18] General Hospital looked at it. He said,
[48:19] "Where do you have this done?" So I told
[48:21] him where I had it done. He said, "It's
[48:23] it's good enough for a diagnostic
[48:25] purposes, but it's not good enough for
[48:27] an operation. I wouldn't operate with
[48:29] this with this uh CAT scan." And so he
[48:34] needed something that had greater
[48:35] clarity and it would have to go through
[48:38] another process. I would have to have it
[48:40] again. So there and it's very important
[48:43] when you get to some critical stage that
[48:45] you see things clearly. You don't want
[48:48] to just have some general idea of the
[48:50] message. For example, I believe that God
[48:53] gave us this message so you could see it
[48:55] clearly. It just doesn't have to be
[48:57] something of general information out
[48:59] there. God didn't give it to that. And I
[49:01] would ask you not to be satisfied with
[49:03] some just general understanding when
[49:06] they when when there's a better picture
[49:08] available. Hallelujah.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Science has empowered governments in
[49:15] this day
[49:18] to essentially take the privacy away
[49:20] from their subjects.
[49:22] There's big cases about it. They've, you
[49:26] know, generally in a in a military
[49:29] uh arena they are doing well computers
[49:34] first were military you know it wasn't
[49:36] built for us. It was built for military
[49:38] purposes and of course now it's it's
[49:41] such a tool for the public. But they've
[49:44] got such power in vision and their
[49:47] optics today that they essentially can
[49:51] see into your home.
[49:54] And uh uh
[49:57] I I was wanting to show you a little
[49:59] object, but we couldn't quite find it.
[50:01] Brother Randy Snow who works in
[50:05] uh fire prevention technology
[50:09] and he has seen some pretty advanced
[50:11] stuff.
[50:13] And one day I was with him and a couple
[50:15] of other brothers. Brother Roy Florent
[50:17] was there and uh we were in the uh
[50:22] Sheraton Hotel at Guilford
[50:25] and he took a little object out of his I
[50:27] wanted to have that object here today.
[50:29] It was about about that long and about
[50:33] that wide and about that thick. Just
[50:37] shiny shiny stainless steel silver
[50:40] object and had a ring on one side about
[50:43] the size of a quarter. Just a a line in
[50:45] it and a ring on the other side about
[50:48] the size of a dime. He said, "See this?"
[50:50] So we're all looking at it. He said,
[50:53] "This was developed by the United States
[50:55] military." He said, "This object is an
[50:58] optic eye.
[51:00] This eye is in the satellites over your
[51:03] head right at this minute.
[51:06] It is it is for spy work and military
[51:09] and whatever more." He said, "This right
[51:12] now can look through this 17story
[51:15] concrete building and tell you the time
[51:18] on your watch."
[51:20] And those brother's eyes, including
[51:22] mine, got us about that big around. We
[51:25] said well you know uh he said thi this
[51:29] this this thing here now we are using it
[51:32] in the domestic field for fire
[51:35] prevention because it used to be that
[51:38] they had to wait they had sensors that
[51:40] were heat sensors and then when the fire
[51:43] would get that sensor hot it would
[51:46] activate the fire retardant system. But
[51:49] he said now this this object sees the
[51:52] flame and sets it off instantly. And he
[51:55] said on ships and and airports where
[51:58] it's very highly flammable inflammable.
[52:02] He said this is the this is the thing
[52:03] that they use. So it came down from a
[52:06] military purpose down to be used in
[52:08] industry. But I thought if I had this
[52:10] here today, it would help you to see
[52:13] that there are there are things that
[52:16] have sight and have vision can look
[52:18] through this building, can look through
[52:20] concrete building and tell you the time
[52:23] on your watch. Let me say that with the
[52:25] two eyes you have in your head, you
[52:27] don't see very much. Amen.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; And there are worlds that are around us
[52:35] &gt;&gt; unseen.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; That even man with his technology has
[52:41] proven that we walk in a very very
[52:44] narrow tunnel of space.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; You don't see very much. And if we walk
[52:49] just by sight, we certainly will not
[52:52] walk by faith.
[52:54] and your faith. God has given an element
[52:57] of faith that can reach far beyond what
[53:01] you see. And as believers, we need to
[53:04] walk where we don't see things.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; We can't walk by sight and really be a
[53:09] full believer. We just can't do it. And
[53:12] I I believe that we're for the most part
[53:15] far too taken up and guided by directed
[53:19] by influenced by what it is that we see.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Now I have a I have a short clip here
[53:29] for you. H I would like uh our brothers
[53:34] to show you. And this starts from about
[53:40] either 10 or 100 million light years
[53:43] into space
[53:45] and takes you to a leaf on a tree in
[53:50] Florida
[53:52] and ends up in such minute detail that
[53:56] it will be uh I just want I want you to
[54:00] see this while you're looking at it.
[54:02] Number one, you you with your naked eye,
[54:04] you don't see the heavens where this is
[54:07] going, and you don't see where it's
[54:09] going to come to. So, we'll just watch
[54:12] it for a moment. 10,000 light years.
[54:16] 1,000 light years.
[54:20] 100 light years.
[54:23] 10 light years.
[54:26] One lightyear.
[54:30] 1 trillion kilometers.
[54:33] 100 billion kilometers.
[54:36] 10 billion kilometers.
[54:40] 1 billion kilometers.
[54:43] 100 million kilometers
[54:46] and 10 million kilometers,
[54:50] 1 million kilometer,
[54:53] 100,000 kilometers. Now you see the
[54:55] Earth, 10,000 kilometers.
[55:00] Now you see Florida 1 th00and kilometers
[55:04] 100 kilometers
[55:07] 10 kilometers
[55:11] 1 kilometer
[55:14] 100 m see the buildings there's the
[55:17] trees 10 m
[55:21] there's some leaves one meter
[55:24] I'll let you go on with it and just
[55:26] watch it
[55:29] a centimeter
[55:32] A millimeter
[55:35] micrometers.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; That beautiful.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; And you step on those leaves all the
[56:21] time.
[56:24] There's a world out there in the
[56:26] universe and there's a world right under
[56:27] your feet and you we don't know a thing
[56:28] about it.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; And God made it all.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brothers.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; God made it all.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; That marvelous.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that God made the
[56:43] worlds.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Rod, for sending that
[56:46] to me about three years ago.
[56:50] Every once in a while somebody sends me
[56:52] something says he said I think brother
[56:55] Ed can use that so I just tuck it away.
[57:00] Faith is the substance
[57:03] of things hoped for, the evidence of
[57:07] things not seen. Faith is a substance of
[57:13] things hoped for, and it is the evidence
[57:16] of things not seen. For by it the elders
[57:20] obtained a good report, and through
[57:22] faith we understand that the worlds,
[57:26] plural, were framed
[57:28] by the word of God, so that things which
[57:31] are seen are not made of things which do
[57:34] appear.
[57:36] There's whole worlds
[57:38] of this minute
[57:41] world. And fact is we wouldn't put this
[57:44] kind of microscopic evidence on the
[57:46] hamburger you eat from some of the fast
[57:48] food joints or you probably never eat
[57:50] another one.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; You know that's true.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; You're going to think it over today
[57:58] before you ordered that hamburger.
[58:02] Things that you don't see. whole worlds
[58:05] that are out there and God made it all.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; We are living friends, we are living in
[58:12] such a narrow little tunnel. And if we
[58:15] are only going to be directed and
[58:17] dictated and our mind is just going to
[58:19] be filled with all of these things that
[58:21] are in here, we're going to miss out on
[58:24] what God is doing.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Our God is great.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Our God is mighty.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Our God is eternal. Hallelujah. And we
[58:33] love him for it.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; The things which are unseen. And the
[58:37] scripture says, "While we look not at
[58:40] the things which are seen, but the
[58:42] things which are unseen." Hallelujah.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Now that I have a quote I'd like to show
[58:48] you also,
[58:51] and I don't don't read it faster than I
[58:54] do. And we and we see that Abraham,
[58:58] he was not a young man when this
[59:01] happened. He was an old man,
[59:05] 75 years old, and his wife Sarah, which
[59:09] was his halfsister, and they had been
[59:12] married many, many years since she was a
[59:14] girl of about 17. It's believed. And God
[59:18] told Abraham, "I have chosen you and
[59:21] Sarah that you are going to have a
[59:23] child." And Sarah had been barren all
[59:27] her life.
[59:29] But Abraham never looked at what his
[59:32] eyes would see. An old wrinkled woman
[59:36] many years past the time of life to have
[59:39] children. But he looked at the unseen
[59:43] and he saw Isaac. I want you stop there
[59:46] a moment. He saw Isaac. That's very
[59:50] important.
[59:52] He looked and he saw Isaac by faith. He
[59:54] saw Isaac and uh
[1:00:07] just trust. Only believe.
[1:00:11] Technology will bring it all back.
[1:00:14] I could read it for you, but I want you
[1:00:16] to see it.
[1:00:20] He looked at the unseen and he saw Isaac
[1:00:23] by faith. He saw Isaac. And notice
[1:00:27] please, and he after looking to the
[1:00:31] unseen, he called those things which
[1:00:34] were not as though they were. After he
[1:00:38] looked to the unseen, but by faith he
[1:00:41] looked to the unseen. But after he
[1:00:44] looked to the unseen, he called. In
[1:00:46] other words, after he looked to the
[1:00:48] unseen, then he made a confession,
[1:00:51] and he staggered not at the promise of
[1:00:53] God, and he called those things which
[1:00:55] were not as though they were. He got a
[1:00:58] glimpse of the unseen. By faith he saw
[1:01:01] it, and the Bible says that he endured
[1:01:04] as seeing the invisible God with him all
[1:01:07] along the road. We say hallelujah.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to bring a very important
[1:01:13] point here. It didn't say that he looked
[1:01:15] at the promise. Now, the promise was
[1:01:18] made. God made the promise. But we we
[1:01:21] say so often just keep looking at the
[1:01:23] promise. Looking at the promise, but
[1:01:25] while we're looking at the promise,
[1:01:26] we're looking at all the conditions and
[1:01:28] all the circumstances around us. And we
[1:01:30] keep quoting the promise like it's
[1:01:32] brainwashing ourselves. Quote the
[1:01:33] promise and quote the promise. No. He
[1:01:36] saw Isaac.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; He saw it already finished. He was
[1:01:41] rejoicing cuz he already had the son.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; He already had him.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Make make the booties. Get the things
[1:01:49] ready cuz I see the son.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; I see Isaac on the way.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; It isn't that. He kept just quoting well
[1:01:56] God said to me. Well, God said to me,
[1:01:57] "Well, God said to me." And we can get
[1:01:59] into a pattern. We just say, "Well, it
[1:02:01] says in the word, ask what you will. Ask
[1:02:03] what you will. Only believe." And what
[1:02:04] we are, we're looking at the promise
[1:02:06] instead of looking to the unseen. We
[1:02:08] need to look to the unseen and see the
[1:02:11] thing that you are praying as it's
[1:02:13] according to the word. You have to know
[1:02:15] there's a promise for it. But then you
[1:02:17] look to the unseen and see it finished.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; See it done. That's what God wants you
[1:02:22] to see. He wants you to see it finished.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; I'm praying for loved ones. And I
[1:02:33] decided instead of quoting the just
[1:02:35] quoting the promise, I'm going to see
[1:02:37] them here in church. I see them with
[1:02:39] their hands raised. I see them
[1:02:41] rejoicing. I see them on the streets of
[1:02:44] glory because God cannot lie.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God cannot lie.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; He didn't say he'll honor your quote
[1:02:54] quote quote quote. He'll honor your
[1:02:56] faith.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; And faith has sight. Faith sees the
[1:03:01] finished product.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Faith sees the end of the road.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Faith sees it all done.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, may we rise up in faith
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; and see it as a finished work.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; I think that's a marvelous principle
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; that we certainly need to put into
[1:03:23] practice
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; and hold it there. Amen.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Faith sees it finished.
[1:03:32] So faith indeed is the substance.
[1:03:35] Now for for us to think that man merely
[1:03:39] by reading the word of God
[1:03:42] by simply reading it that we have a
[1:03:45] perfect understanding of the word. I'd
[1:03:48] say that is folly. That's a great
[1:03:49] deception.
[1:03:51] I say that because if that were so, then
[1:03:54] all humans with uh uh some level of
[1:03:58] intelligence could read the scripture
[1:04:01] and we would not be having churches on
[1:04:03] every corner because they'd all be
[1:04:05] believing the same thing. If it was just
[1:04:07] by human intelligence reading the Bible
[1:04:10] and say, "Oh, that's what it means."
[1:04:13] Then we'd all believe the same thing.
[1:04:15] But that isn't the case because
[1:04:19] Jesus said, "To you it is given
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; and to them it's not given."
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; And that's a hard statement to make at
[1:04:30] times. But the scripture says
[1:04:34] in 1 Corinthians 1:19,
[1:04:37] "For it is written, I will destroy the
[1:04:40] wisdom of the wise, and will bring to
[1:04:44] nothing the understanding of the
[1:04:45] prudent.
[1:04:47] Who is the wise? Where is the scribe?
[1:04:52] Where is the disputer of this world?
[1:04:54] Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of
[1:04:58] this world?" I would say just with the
[1:05:00] little clip we saw coming from a 100
[1:05:03] million lighty years out of space or
[1:05:04] whatever it was to a leaf in Florida, I
[1:05:08] would say even that would make uh the
[1:05:10] wisdom of the wise utter foolishness.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; God in his greatness. Who can understand
[1:05:15] it?
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; And that is God. We just addressed him
[1:05:19] in prayer as our father. Our father made
[1:05:22] that
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; and that is just a that that is such an
[1:05:26] infotal uh amount of what he's made. We
[1:05:30] we can't eternity eternity itself is
[1:05:33] without beginning and without end. I
[1:05:35] feel sorry for anybody here that has not
[1:05:37] got in uh eternity as their goal.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; We have eternity. Eternal life is our
[1:05:43] goal. I was trying to ponder. I prayed
[1:05:46] this morning said, "Oh God, help me to
[1:05:48] understand something more about
[1:05:50] eternity, eternal life, and and what's
[1:05:53] on the other side." Because I began as I
[1:05:56] pondered this over the last few weeks,
[1:05:58] we're living in such a uh such a small,
[1:06:02] it's just like a tunnel. We have tunnel
[1:06:03] vision. And and I think it's a real
[1:06:07] trick of Satan to just get us so
[1:06:10] engrossed with just our little lives and
[1:06:13] our little circle to eat up all of our
[1:06:16] energy, eat up all of our time, eat up
[1:06:18] all of our whole being, just consume
[1:06:21] ourselves with something and pass off
[1:06:23] the scene with actually no testimony and
[1:06:26] no record when God himself put us here
[1:06:30] for a purpose.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? put you here for a
[1:06:35] purpose, to be a witness and to have a
[1:06:37] testimony for him. And may we say this
[1:06:40] morning, oh God, let me live here for
[1:06:42] the divine purpose, the purpose that you
[1:06:45] have. Otherwise, it's just a exercise of
[1:06:48] futility. But we're here that we might
[1:06:51] be an expression of Jesus Christ.
[1:06:56] He hath hath not God made foolish the
[1:07:00] wisdom of this world.
[1:07:03] I'll say that the message that we
[1:07:06] believe and the message that God sent
[1:07:09] through his prophet messenger is an such
[1:07:12] utter simplicity that it has made
[1:07:16] foolish the wisdom of the world.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Look at the message of the serpent seed.
[1:07:21] One of the mysteries the message of the
[1:07:24] serpent seed and the original sin.
[1:07:28] The host of churches in in the religious
[1:07:31] world believe in some kind of an apple,
[1:07:34] believe in some kind of a fruit. And a
[1:07:36] prophet comes in his simplistic way and
[1:07:39] says it's nothing short it was a act of
[1:07:43] adultery and it was a sexual sin. It is
[1:07:47] a blood sin. Thus, it had to be a blood
[1:07:50] sacrifice. It was a blood sin. That's
[1:07:53] why Abraham had to be circumcised as God
[1:07:56] testifying. And he says, "And that
[1:07:58] foreskin will be a token to me." Why
[1:08:01] would that uh embarrassing part of of of
[1:08:05] a a man's body be a token to God? Cuz
[1:08:08] God was declaring, "I'm not going to use
[1:08:10] the human instrumentality to bring my
[1:08:13] promised son on the scene. I will
[1:08:15] promise you a son. But that promised son
[1:08:18] is coming by my word. Not coming by your
[1:08:21] efforts. Not coming by what you can do.
[1:08:24] And you circumcise yourself. And that
[1:08:26] will be a token to me. That'll be a
[1:08:28] token unto me because this son isn't
[1:08:31] coming that way. And it all ties
[1:08:33] together with the original sin. And it
[1:08:35] has made foolish
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; all the apples and all the other fruit
[1:08:40] and whatever more. And they can't even
[1:08:42] explain the original sin. God sent a
[1:08:45] messenger.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And a pillar of fire
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; and a light that has made this book a
[1:08:54] new book. Has made it alive. Hallelujah.
[1:08:58] I say blessed be his name. In the
[1:09:01] simplicity of the of the message came
[1:09:04] the revelation of and but to you it is
[1:09:06] given and to others it's not given. I
[1:09:09] thank God it was given. Amen.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Bear with me. Apostle Paul says, "Bear
[1:09:17] with me in my folly. And indeed, bear
[1:09:19] with me, for I'm jealous over you with a
[1:09:22] godly jealousy, for I have espoused you
[1:09:25] to one husband,
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; that you may be a chasteed virgin unto
[1:09:31] Christ, but I fear lest as the serpent
[1:09:34] beguiled Eve." Oh my.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; So your mind shall be corrupted from the
[1:09:39] simplicity that is in Christ.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; What's the Apostle Paul saying? He's
[1:09:43] saying in the clearest language that can
[1:09:45] be said
[1:09:47] that Eve didn't have one husband
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; and she did not come to that one husband
[1:09:53] chasteed or virgin. And I don't even
[1:09:55] know why I'm saying this this morning,
[1:09:57] but that's absolute scripture from
[1:09:59] Genesis to Revelation. And you can't
[1:10:02] escape it. And every soul will have to
[1:10:05] answer to that one day. God sent a
[1:10:08] confirmed message, a vindicated message.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:13] My friends here, young men, young
[1:10:15] ladies, brothers and sisters in Christ,
[1:10:18] if this would be my last message, let me
[1:10:20] declare to you that God, the unseen that
[1:10:23] you can't see, has come from the unseen
[1:10:26] and come down into the visible and
[1:10:29] confirmed his word with signs and
[1:10:31] wonders and powers and the fulfillment
[1:10:34] of the prophecy of the scripture.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; And don't ever stray from it. Hold right
[1:10:40] fast to it
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; and it will open up to more things and
[1:10:44] more things. You'll see more on down the
[1:10:47] road than you'll see even today. This
[1:10:49] God is endless.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; We're not coming down to nanometers and
[1:10:55] fem or whatever it was. We're not coming
[1:10:58] down inspecting some leaf or some bug.
[1:11:01] We're going out into the great beyond.
[1:11:04] Hallelujah. into that great place that
[1:11:07] God fills all time and space and his
[1:11:10] children shall be with him. His family
[1:11:13] shall be with him. You think of God that
[1:11:15] can do that and show that on just a
[1:11:18] leaf. You think he had any trouble
[1:11:20] making us a body, a theophony?
[1:11:22] Hallelujah. A glorified body. You think
[1:11:25] that God has any trouble raising up a
[1:11:28] body out of the grave and changing the
[1:11:30] atoms or taking the gases of one that
[1:11:33] has been burned at the stake that God
[1:11:35] will call it all back.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; And he will not lose one thing that he
[1:11:41] had purposed in his mind. He will call
[1:11:43] it all back.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; That's the God I believe in. That's the
[1:11:47] God I'm preaching this morning. He's the
[1:11:50] eternal God. He's the creator of heavens
[1:11:53] and earth. Amen.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; For after that in the wisdom of God, the
[1:12:02] world by wisdom knew not God. It pleased
[1:12:05] God by the foolishness of preaching to
[1:12:08] save them that believe.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Even the preaching this morning, as
[1:12:12] simple as it might be, as humble as it
[1:12:14] might be, in the foolishness of
[1:12:16] preaching,
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; God chose to save those that will be
[1:12:20] saved. He's got somebody that'll scream
[1:12:23] out and he's got somebody that he's
[1:12:25] screaming out for.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; For I and then the uh
[1:12:33] and then Job
[1:12:35] he saw some things.
[1:12:38] He said, uh,
[1:12:40] for I know that my redeemer liveth,
[1:12:44] and that he shall stand at the latter
[1:12:46] day upon the earth, and though after my
[1:12:50] skin worms destroy this body, yet in my
[1:12:54] flesh shall I see God.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; That's a powerful statement. Let the
[1:12:59] skin worms eat up my body, digest the
[1:13:02] material thereof, but yet in my flesh I
[1:13:06] shall see God. Hallelujah.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; He had a he had an understanding. He
[1:13:12] finally came to a place where he began
[1:13:14] to see and he said, "Whom I shall see
[1:13:17] for myself, I shall see him
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; and mine eyes shall behold
[1:13:24] and not another. Though my reigns be
[1:13:28] consumed within me,
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; shall he'll see him."
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in the message,
[1:13:34] "Show us the father."
[1:13:37] He said, "Now that's been the cry of the
[1:13:39] human heart.
[1:13:41] Through all the ages is to see God.
[1:13:46] We see him in nature.
[1:13:49] You can see him in a flower. You can see
[1:13:51] him in so many.
[1:13:56] You can see him everywhere."
[1:13:59] Brother Bram tells the story that little
[1:14:01] boy
[1:14:03] asked his Sunday school teacher, I
[1:14:04] believe it was, he'd like to see God. He
[1:14:07] said, "No, no one can see God." And the
[1:14:10] old man, they were in the boat
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; and the sun was setting out in the west
[1:14:16] and the whole sky was painted all the
[1:14:20] colors that only the creator can paint
[1:14:22] them. And a little boy said something to
[1:14:24] him. I may not be telling the story
[1:14:26] completely, but he just said, "You want
[1:14:28] to see God?" Teacher said, "Nobody can
[1:14:31] see God." The old fisherman said, "Son,
[1:14:34] that's all I've ever seen is God.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; We see him in the mountains.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; We see him in the weather. We see him
[1:14:41] everywhere.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; We see him in his word.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; We see God and we see him in one
[1:14:47] another. We see him in his body." And I
[1:14:50] can tell you that seeing him in his body
[1:14:52] is a more that's a more accurate view
[1:14:55] than even seeing him in nature. All
[1:14:58] kinds of people in the world see him in
[1:15:00] nature. They see God, they want to
[1:15:02] identify. They see God in the universe.
[1:15:04] Of course, even a fool, a fool said in
[1:15:06] his heart, there is no God. They see him
[1:15:08] in in the universe. All kinds of people
[1:15:10] see him in in nature. And a lot of
[1:15:13] people see him in the various churches,
[1:15:14] but their vision is not very clear. But
[1:15:17] then there's got to be a place where you
[1:15:18] see him in his people.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; You see God, this God that I'm talking
[1:15:25] about in his people in such such a
[1:15:29] variety of ways. He said every man has
[1:15:33] wanted to know God and to see God. Job
[1:15:37] wanted to see him. Moses wanted to know
[1:15:41] who that was in the burning bush. Then
[1:15:44] he said, "Show me your glory." Moses
[1:15:47] said he wanted to see some manifestation
[1:15:50] to know that it was God. And all of us
[1:15:54] do that. I wonder if you have that cry
[1:15:56] in your heart this morning. Said all of
[1:15:58] us do that. We have that cry. We want to
[1:16:01] know that God. We are. We all long to
[1:16:05] see something that's real. To see
[1:16:08] something to prove that God is. You
[1:16:12] know, we're not here just to come to
[1:16:13] church and hear some songs and hear a
[1:16:16] sermon. We're not here for that. Our
[1:16:19] real purpose down deep in our heart,
[1:16:21] every person hungers and longs for a God
[1:16:25] that that is
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; present in my situation, in my home, in
[1:16:32] my family, in my job, in every area of
[1:16:36] my problems or my concerns. This God is
[1:16:40] not can't be something that is a god of
[1:16:42] the past or a god of the future or a god
[1:16:44] of somewhere else and great things
[1:16:46] happen back there. They got to happen
[1:16:48] now.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; This God is not limited.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; This God I'm preaching is here at this
[1:16:57] instant
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; and he's here to deliver any bound
[1:17:00] person that wants to cry out for
[1:17:02] deliverance. Amen.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Regardless of what that bondage is, this
[1:17:06] God is here now to give sight, spiritual
[1:17:11] sight.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; If you're blind, and I can tell you
[1:17:14] there's more blindness in the world than
[1:17:15] there is sight when it comes spiritually
[1:17:18] speaking. And if you do have vision, but
[1:17:20] it's not clear, say, "God, give me
[1:17:22] clarity of view of vision. Let me see
[1:17:26] with clarity."
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Don't let it be some cat scan. Don't let
[1:17:29] there be some MRI that they can't that
[1:17:32] you can't perform a surgery with. Do
[1:17:34] whatever is necessary and give me a
[1:17:36] clear vision.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; If my soul needs an operation or
[1:17:41] something within my spiritual life, do
[1:17:43] that for me.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; That God has to be present. And he is
[1:17:47] present. And I want to see that God
[1:17:49] doing those kind of things on a regular
[1:17:53] basis
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; in God's people. I don't want to be
[1:17:55] speaking about a God that just you get
[1:17:57] enthused with for a moment or a Sunday
[1:18:00] or from one meeting to the next. But we
[1:18:02] want to see a God that's working in your
[1:18:04] lives, working in your daytoday life.
[1:18:07] Amen. Doing things that you can come to
[1:18:10] the house of God rejoicing that he has
[1:18:13] done such marvelous things for you.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; He's great.
[1:18:26] And the disciples came
[1:18:28] and said unto him,
[1:18:31] "Why speakest thou unto them in
[1:18:34] parables?"
[1:18:38] The disciples themselves didn't
[1:18:40] understand the parable.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; You know that
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; if you read the scripture, they even
[1:18:47] asked him,
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; "What does this mean? And he's told them
[1:18:52] you understand them.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Others it's not given but to you it's
[1:18:57] given
[1:19:02] but why do you speak to them in
[1:19:04] parables?
[1:19:05] And he answered
[1:19:07] now just put yourself in their place.
[1:19:09] They're asking their Lord Jesus the
[1:19:11] master
[1:19:13] why are you using these parables? Well,
[1:19:16] because
[1:19:18] it is given
[1:19:21] to you to know the mysteries of the
[1:19:25] kingdom of heaven, but to them it's not
[1:19:28] given.
[1:19:32] For whosoever hath, to him shall be
[1:19:34] given, and he shall have more abundance.
[1:19:38] I'd like to just break that down a
[1:19:40] moment. To whosoever hath, what do you
[1:19:42] have? If you haven't had that seed of
[1:19:46] eternal life, it can never be added to.
[1:19:50] But those that have are predestinated by
[1:19:53] almighty God, this God who's the
[1:19:56] invisible God, that you cannot even
[1:19:59] begin to uh to grasp the scope, you
[1:20:03] can't even begin to grasp the scope of
[1:20:05] his of some of the minor and the lowest
[1:20:09] forms of life.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; We can't grasp it. Are you with me?
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; You know, we get so elevated in our
[1:20:16] mind, we understand such great things.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; That kind of wisdom is foolishness to
[1:20:20] God.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; What kind of wisdom is is is is real
[1:20:24] wisdom to God is wisdom that comes by
[1:20:27] faith or faith wisdom.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Faith wisdom, sir.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:41] because it is given to you. And for
[1:20:44] whosoever hath to him shall be given, he
[1:20:47] that hath that eternal life seed in him,
[1:20:51] to him, to her it shall be given, and to
[1:20:55] him that hath not,
[1:20:57] from him shall be taken away even that
[1:21:00] he hath. And therefore I speak to them
[1:21:03] in parables because they seeing they see
[1:21:06] not and hearing they hear not and
[1:21:09] neither do they understand. If they
[1:21:11] don't understand how in the world is a
[1:21:14] person going to be enlightened.
[1:21:18] We all have gone to school
[1:21:20] some a whole lot more than others but we
[1:21:23] go there to understand.
[1:21:25] And then we find out that technology
[1:21:27] advances so fast that what we had is
[1:21:30] just a boat anchor.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; It's just gone so quickly.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; There isn't there isn't a person there
[1:21:35] isn't a carpenter here that works the
[1:21:37] way carpenters do. My father was a
[1:21:39] carpenter. I saw how he worked. There
[1:21:41] isn't anybody here. There's not an
[1:21:42] accountant here that's doing things
[1:21:44] exactly as they did. There's no one
[1:21:46] here. Everything is so advanced and we
[1:21:48] don't want to go back to the old the old
[1:21:50] system. We might get melancholy when we
[1:21:53] talk about the old ways, but somehow
[1:21:55] nobody wants to go back.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Nobody wants to go out here and and get
[1:21:58] their horse out of the barn and bring it
[1:22:00] up to and hitch it up and get out in the
[1:22:02] wagon and drive home in the rain.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; I'd be home in 10 minutes and take you a
[1:22:07] day or so.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; You want to go back to the old times?
[1:22:12] No, just in your mind.
[1:22:14] We'd like to think about it.
[1:22:20] You kids, you don't know anything about
[1:22:21] some of these. All you know about is
[1:22:24] automatic dishwashers and automatic,
[1:22:29] you know, dryers and
[1:22:32] and I'm not that ancient, but I have run
[1:22:35] one of those that went like this
[1:22:38] washing machine. That's what agitated it
[1:22:43] for my mom. I run that thing like that.
[1:22:49] Or you go to get the homogenized milk,
[1:22:51] you know, but you don't know anything
[1:22:52] about, you know, going like this for a
[1:22:54] cream separator. How many know anything
[1:22:56] about this? Oh my, there's a few more
[1:22:59] ancients around here. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:01] We're not all alone.
[1:23:03] But we don't want to go back there. You
[1:23:05] want to go back? No, I don't want to go
[1:23:07] back. I soon just stop at the store and
[1:23:09] pick up a 2% homogenized.
[1:23:13] That's the way we are
[1:23:17] spiritually.
[1:23:20] I know where I'm going spiritually.
[1:23:23] Oh, we'll send them. Brother Tony on
[1:23:26] Wednesday mentioned, you know, being in
[1:23:28] Bible school, I think four years, and
[1:23:30] Rebecca about three years. And many
[1:23:32] others have been there, too. And you go
[1:23:33] there. Oh, we're going to learn about
[1:23:36] God.
[1:23:38] And we're going to come out of here and
[1:23:39] tell people about God because we it's
[1:23:40] been handed down and handed down and
[1:23:42] handed down and handed down and to get
[1:23:44] all of this all systematic and all of
[1:23:47] this put together in nice neat packages
[1:23:49] and even learn exactly how to present it
[1:23:52] and how you make your entrance into your
[1:23:54] message and how you reach your peak and
[1:23:56] then how you come down and how you
[1:23:58] really uh you know uh uh strike a
[1:24:01] certain nerve with the people and and
[1:24:03] how you close and how you get people
[1:24:05] forward and how you get them to members
[1:24:08] and all of this is studied and learned
[1:24:10] and because every organization's
[1:24:12] interested in membership and they learn
[1:24:14] about they learn about the original sin
[1:24:18] and they learn about predestination or
[1:24:21] they ignore it completely
[1:24:24] and as ministers that I've called right
[1:24:26] in this community in this city I've
[1:24:29] called them asked him about Revelation
[1:24:31] 17 and one says oh he says stay away
[1:24:34] from that he says that's dangerous
[1:24:39] and he's a scholar. He's a learned man.
[1:24:42] And then you have then you then you have
[1:24:45] God raised up someone
[1:24:48] who's got his hints and his canes and
[1:24:50] can't get the grammar exactly straight
[1:24:53] and as someone said to me off the radio
[1:24:55] broadcast uses the English uses the
[1:24:58] queen's worst English but he said but
[1:25:00] what he says is the truth.
[1:25:03] Amen.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; I don't know the man who wrote the
[1:25:07] letter, but then he he raises up one
[1:25:12] and in his utter humility and simplicity
[1:25:16] says there's a a pillar of fire.
[1:25:22] And that pillar of fire is none other
[1:25:25] than the spirit of the Lord Jesus
[1:25:27] Christ.
[1:25:29] And I'm just your brother.
[1:25:32] I couldn't do anything.
[1:25:34] I don't know you, but he knows you.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; But if he will come
[1:25:42] and then he'll say, "He's here."
[1:25:46] Who's here? The one that made these,
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; the one that knows every secret.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; And then you hear him say, "You couldn't
[1:25:56] hide anything in your life for me. You
[1:25:58] couldn't hide anything now
[1:26:01] if you tried.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; It's all exposed. Why? Because a prophet
[1:26:06] optics.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; God looking from the unseen to the
[1:26:12] scene.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And starts telling the people this is
[1:26:16] what the situation is exactly. Even the
[1:26:19] doctors with their medical science, they
[1:26:22] have said it's this. And you've had one,
[1:26:25] two, three, four, five operations,
[1:26:29] but they couldn't find it. And then the
[1:26:32] prophet optics, God speaking, but it's
[1:26:35] this.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Now, any accur any any vision that is
[1:26:40] that accurate, you better believe one
[1:26:44] thing. Those kind of optics are the only
[1:26:47] optics that can look at this and tell
[1:26:49] you what it is.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; They're the only optics.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; The only thing that has such intensity
[1:26:57] and clarity that can look at this word
[1:26:59] of God that has puzzled the world for
[1:27:02] centuries and centuries since it's been
[1:27:05] written. It puzzled it because God hid
[1:27:07] it. And Jesus said these are the
[1:27:10] mysteries and only that kind of optics
[1:27:13] is going to understand the mysteries of
[1:27:15] God. Man with his understanding will get
[1:27:17] one interpretation, another man another
[1:27:19] interpretation. Who are we going to
[1:27:21] believe? I'm going to believe the angel
[1:27:24] of the Lord. I'm going to believe the
[1:27:26] pillar of fire. It's not a man that
[1:27:28] we're believing. It's God that made
[1:27:31] those things that speaks through the
[1:27:33] individual. How do we know? because he
[1:27:35] was he was uh he was strong enough to be
[1:27:39] able to say
[1:27:41] the God
[1:27:43] let the God
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; now come and prove it.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Let the God who gave the word let the
[1:27:51] God who spoke the word let him now come
[1:27:54] and prove that word
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; and let him prove what I've said is the
[1:27:58] truth.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:05] Jesus gave a number of parables
[1:28:09] and I'll I'll going to give you some
[1:28:13] slides just now.
[1:28:18] I would like mysteries starting with
[1:28:20] mysteries of the kingdom please.
[1:28:30] A mystery.
[1:28:32] Jesus spoke now a number of mysteries. A
[1:28:35] mystery is a previously hidden truth now
[1:28:40] divinely revealed but in which a
[1:28:43] supernatural element still remains
[1:28:46] despite the revelation. So many people
[1:28:49] I've had I've had literally uh thousands
[1:28:53] of people say I got the revelation and
[1:28:55] for some it was absolutely true because
[1:28:58] it proved that they had the revelation
[1:29:00] because their life remained stable and
[1:29:03] they continued on. They had a hold of
[1:29:05] something from the unseen invisible
[1:29:07] realm. And and a mystery according to
[1:29:09] the according to the Greek is
[1:29:13] a previously hidden truth now divinely
[1:29:17] revealed.
[1:29:19] And when it was spoken, when the prophet
[1:29:21] messenger spoke it, it was divinely
[1:29:23] revealed. But there was still a
[1:29:26] supernatural element that remained
[1:29:28] despite the revelation. And only God who
[1:29:32] spoke it, only God who revealed it. Like
[1:29:35] Jesus, now now just hold it closely,
[1:29:38] please. Jesus told the parable, and
[1:29:41] we're going to go into that in a moment.
[1:29:43] A parable of the swer and the seed.
[1:29:47] He He spoke it. Now, a parable, as we'll
[1:29:50] see in a few moments, is something that
[1:29:52] is a it's an example. It is something
[1:29:55] that goes parallel. Here's the truth of
[1:29:59] it and here's here is something now
[1:30:01] that's being spoken that is to go
[1:30:03] parallel with it that should that should
[1:30:06] inform the person of what that is that
[1:30:10] was spoken. So he spoke of the swer and
[1:30:12] the seed asked him what is that what
[1:30:15] does that mean? Well, he said the the
[1:30:18] the swer is the son of man. The good
[1:30:21] seed are the children of the kingdom.
[1:30:23] The world the earth is the world. And he
[1:30:26] began to tell them what it is. And the
[1:30:27] seed is the word of God. He began to
[1:30:30] explain what it was. But there is a
[1:30:33] divinely a divinely a supernatural
[1:30:36] element that still remains despite the
[1:30:39] revelation. And the disciples did not
[1:30:42] have it at that moment even though he
[1:30:45] revealed what it was but they came to
[1:30:47] know what it was.
[1:30:50] And that's exactly the same as it is
[1:30:51] with us. Now please if we go to the next
[1:30:54] one
[1:30:55] the first mystery Jesus went on and told
[1:30:58] and if you had a Scullfield Bible
[1:31:01] Brother Brandham quoted Dr. Scoffield in
[1:31:04] these first uh first number of of
[1:31:08] mysteries. The mystery of the kingdom of
[1:31:10] heaven. That's the one he said we're
[1:31:13] talking on now. The second mystery was
[1:31:15] the mystery of Israel's blindness during
[1:31:18] this age. Romans 11 and 25. And the
[1:31:22] third mystery was the mystery of the
[1:31:24] translation of the living saints at the
[1:31:27] end of this age. Uh 1 Corinthians 15 and
[1:31:30] so on. And the fourth mystery, the New
[1:31:33] Testament church as one body composed of
[1:31:37] both Jews and Gentiles. And I've given
[1:31:39] the scriptural references there for you.
[1:31:43] The fifth mystery is of the church as
[1:31:46] the bride of Christ out of Ephesians
[1:31:49] 5:28:32. The sixth mystery is the living
[1:31:52] Christ, same yesterday, today, and
[1:31:55] forever. And we have that in Hebrews
[1:31:57] 13:8 and so on. Now the seventh mystery
[1:32:01] is of God, even Christ as the incarnate
[1:32:04] fullness of the Godhead bottle embodied
[1:32:07] in whom all divine wisdom and godliness
[1:32:10] is restored to man. The eighth mystery,
[1:32:13] the mystery of the processes by which
[1:32:17] godliness is restored to man. And the
[1:32:20] ninth mystery, the mystery of iniquity
[1:32:23] found in 1 Thessalonians 2 and 7.
[1:32:28] Next one, please. The 10th mystery, the
[1:32:31] seven stars of Revelation 1:20. The
[1:32:34] seven stars are the seven church ages
[1:32:37] and the seven messengers and so forth.
[1:32:40] The 11th mystery is mystery Babylon the
[1:32:44] prostitute spoken of in Revelation the
[1:32:47] great harlot 17 revelation 175-7.
[1:32:51] Now, brother Brandon goes on here at
[1:32:52] this point. He says that is some of the
[1:32:54] mysteries that this angel is supposed to
[1:32:57] wind up those 11. Dr. Scoffield has in
[1:33:02] in his notes in the Bible. I carry a
[1:33:04] Scoffield Bible. He says that is some of
[1:33:07] the mysteries that this angel is
[1:33:08] supposed to wind up. And may I say this
[1:33:11] with reverence and not referring to
[1:33:14] myself but referring to the angel of
[1:33:18] God. Now, brother Brandham is going to
[1:33:20] go on from here, but he has inserted
[1:33:22] this. Let me refer to the angel of God.
[1:33:26] Let me refer to that supernatural
[1:33:29] element in the ministry. Hallelujah. I
[1:33:32] can't do that this morning. I am not
[1:33:34] that prophet messenger. But he could do
[1:33:37] that. But I can say one thing. I believe
[1:33:40] what he is saying
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; because of the supernatural element,
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:47] If you stood here on this platform and
[1:33:50] and had that kind of a record and that
[1:33:52] kind of a testimony, it would carry some
[1:33:55] weight.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; If you even spoke something that was
[1:33:58] strange as he did out of the scripture,
[1:34:01] but said now and and many out there, uh
[1:34:04] I'm not pointing to you, but out in the
[1:34:06] audience at that time couldn't couldn't
[1:34:08] even believe what he was saying was the
[1:34:11] truth. But then to have the uh uh the
[1:34:15] confidence to say let the God
[1:34:19] who wrote the word, let the God who does
[1:34:23] the supernatural, if he is God, and if I
[1:34:26] have spoken the truth, let him come now
[1:34:29] and confirm that it's true. That one
[1:34:32] that came was the angel of God.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; And I would say, what would God who
[1:34:38] cannot honor error? God who cannot stand
[1:34:43] unbelief. God who knows nothing of
[1:34:47] telling a lie. What kind of a God would
[1:34:50] he be coming and confirming all kinds of
[1:34:53] falsehood
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; and false doctrine? Never.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; I say never.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Do you believe me?
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Never. Not my God.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; My God will only honor the truth.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Will only honor the truth. Amen.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; And how people are theologians and think
[1:35:13] they know the scripture can say that
[1:35:15] some a man can stand there and and their
[1:35:18] god is going to come and confirm error
[1:35:21] and lead people into false doctrine. I
[1:35:23] say never. The problem is they don't
[1:35:26] have clarity of vision.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; We need to have clarity of vision.
[1:35:30] Friends, we need to be able to see more
[1:35:32] than we have seen.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; I trust you're not satisfied with where
[1:35:36] you're at.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I got even saying this little
[1:35:39] clip. I got such an appreciation. Oh
[1:35:42] God, you can take me down into a leaf on
[1:35:45] a tree in Florida and show me all of
[1:35:47] that. And when you get to the end,
[1:35:49] there's such marvelous colors and I step
[1:35:52] on those things. It doesn't mean a thing
[1:35:54] to me. And here there's whole worlds
[1:35:55] down there. Oh God, if that is the case
[1:36:00] on a little leaf, a botany plant, what
[1:36:02] about the eternal God? What about this
[1:36:06] right here? What about this eternal God?
[1:36:09] Hallelujah.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, I deny
[1:36:13] every falsehood, every false spirit.
[1:36:16] This word is true and this messenger
[1:36:18] spoke the truth.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; And my God confirmed it was the truth.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I'm on a war path after
[1:36:27] the devil today.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Any spirit that tells you anything else,
[1:36:31] any spirit that cause you to doubt this
[1:36:33] word, that is not from God. Hallelujah.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm not referring to myself,
[1:36:45] but I'm referring to the angel of God."
[1:36:48] That is in Is this the time, sir? Next
[1:36:52] slide, please.
[1:36:54] Now, these are some of the other
[1:36:56] mysteries. The serpent seed, that's been
[1:36:59] a hidden mystery all through the years.
[1:37:04] And I will say that God
[1:37:07] God
[1:37:09] made man's wisdom utter foolishness.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; You want to be sit here and believe it
[1:37:17] was an apple, you go right ahead.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; I say you're a foolish man or a foolish
[1:37:22] woman
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. That's such
[1:37:26] utter foolishness
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; that somebody ate an apple and plunged
[1:37:29] the whole world into sin.
[1:37:32] She defiled the womb.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; And the only reason she was saved is
[1:37:36] because Adam took her quickly and gave
[1:37:39] her his seed.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; And God could not destroy her with
[1:37:43] Adam's seed in her.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; And look where we were.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Look at the look at the debauchery and
[1:37:52] sin we were in. But God, he would have
[1:37:54] destroyed us. But Jesus Christ came.
[1:37:58] Hallelujah. And pregnant us with his
[1:38:00] seed.
[1:38:02] eternal life seed
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; and God can't destroy that seed.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; He can't destroy you
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; and made you and him one.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Just a couple more moments. The grace
[1:38:21] straightened out as brother Tony
[1:38:23] preached Wednesday. Not disgrace but
[1:38:26] real true grace.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; No such a thing as an eternal burning
[1:38:30] hell. Hey, how you going to be in
[1:38:32] eternal hell without eternal life? And
[1:38:34] the only eternal life is from God
[1:38:36] himself. There can be no eternal hell.
[1:38:39] It might be millions of years as he
[1:38:41] said. He said it might be for millions
[1:38:44] of years, but anything that was eternal
[1:38:47] had never beginning or end and hell was
[1:38:50] created. Listen friends, that's the
[1:38:52] scripture.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; I don't care what your religion told
[1:38:56] you. I don't care what your preacher
[1:38:58] told you. I don't care what your Bible
[1:39:00] school told you. I have a prophet that
[1:39:03] has pointed to the word. And the
[1:39:05] scripture says that hell was created
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; for the devil and his angels.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; And the devil's not going to be there
[1:39:13] forever cuz he doesn't have eternal
[1:39:15] life.
[1:39:17] [Applause]
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; And by the foolishness of preaching, God
[1:39:23] has made foolish the wisdom of the
[1:39:25] world. I so thank God for the word that
[1:39:29] we have. Hallelujah. I say praise be to
[1:39:33] God to all of those that are on internet
[1:39:35] today. You ought to stand up in your
[1:39:37] room and say praise be to God for this
[1:39:40] glorious message that God has given us.
[1:39:42] Hallelujah. To them it has not been
[1:39:44] given. To you it has been given. You
[1:39:47] should say thank you Lord. You gave it
[1:39:49] to me. You gave it to me. I didn't
[1:39:52] deserve it. I didn't earn it. I couldn't
[1:39:54] buy it. You gave it to me.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; In the next slide, please.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; The mystery of the baptism of the Holy
[1:40:10] Ghost without sensation, but the person
[1:40:13] of Christ performing in you the same
[1:40:16] works that he did. and the mystery of
[1:40:19] water baptism where the extreme tr
[1:40:21] trinitarianism has brought it into the
[1:40:24] titles of father, son, and holy ghost.
[1:40:26] And the mystery of the godhead being
[1:40:28] fulfilled in the baptism in the name of
[1:40:32] Jesus Christ.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to conclude there.
[1:40:38] I know you want to go on,
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; but I feel I'll just conclude there.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; There's a lot more, isn't there?
[1:40:49] I said to my wife, I was going to preach
[1:40:51] by the watch today.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; If I preach according to your hunger and
[1:40:57] your appetite, I'd carry on and I' I'd
[1:41:01] blow my wad.
[1:41:06] Hallelujah.
[1:41:09] Let me just look here and see.
[1:41:16] Maybe I'll just I'll give you just
[1:41:19] something so you can think on for uh
[1:41:22] next next service
[1:41:26] because Jesus was speaking of parables.
[1:41:29] He said a parable
[1:41:32] said I speak to them in parables. A
[1:41:34] parable
[1:41:36] is a placing of one thing by the sight
[1:41:39] of another.
[1:41:42] A parable is a comparison of one thing
[1:41:46] with another, a likeness, a similitude.
[1:41:51] And a parable is an example by which a
[1:41:54] doctrine or precept is illustrated. The
[1:41:58] placing of one thing beside another. It
[1:42:00] goes in parallel. It goes in tandem. It
[1:42:03] goes alongside of it. And there was
[1:42:06] Jesus himself, the sewer, sewing the
[1:42:10] seed, the good seed into the earth. It
[1:42:13] was going right along with what he was
[1:42:15] doing. So he gave a parable of exactly
[1:42:17] what was happening. And he revealed it
[1:42:19] to them, but they didn't they didn't
[1:42:21] understand it. They didn't comprehend
[1:42:23] it. There was it was revealed, but there
[1:42:26] was still a supernatural element that
[1:42:29] that remained in the revelation of it.
[1:42:33] Here we have, you know, uh, you that
[1:42:36] have read the seals and you've lived in
[1:42:38] the message and you've heard it so many
[1:42:40] times. I want to say to you, don't don't
[1:42:44] just sit in a service and don't just
[1:42:47] read a book through. It's not a
[1:42:48] paperback book.
[1:42:51] Don't take the Bible and just read it.
[1:42:54] Well, I got to read a chapter tonight
[1:42:55] because I'm I'm going through the Bible.
[1:42:58] That that's that's whether you're going
[1:42:59] through the Bible, well, God bless you
[1:43:01] for it. But that there's more to it.
[1:43:03] Maybe it's the Holy Spirit wants to
[1:43:04] speak to you out of John's gospel
[1:43:06] instead of back in Genesis or someplace.
[1:43:09] You want to be mindful of the Holy
[1:43:11] Spirit and the thing that God causes you
[1:43:13] to ponder. Maybe you heard something in
[1:43:15] a service today and God will cause you
[1:43:17] to ponder something and you go home and
[1:43:19] then a certain scripture come. Don't
[1:43:20] don't push it away. Go right now and get
[1:43:23] your concordance and if you got a
[1:43:25] computer, get there and search it out
[1:43:27] and go and read it and ponder it. Maybe
[1:43:29] a certain quote will come. Oh yeah. What
[1:43:31] message was that? And go and get that
[1:43:33] and listen to it carefully and ponder it
[1:43:36] and let the Holy Spirit
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; give you the supernatural element.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; It's been revealed.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; But there's a supernatural element to
[1:43:45] it.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; And so we'll be going on from here
[1:43:54] in the next service.
[1:43:57] We have so much more and I want you to
[1:43:59] have a bit of time out and be rested for
[1:44:03] this evening's meeting. Amen.
[1:44:07] Hallelujah. Let's stand to our feet,
[1:44:10] shall we?
[1:44:15] I want to sing a little bit and just
[1:44:16] worship.
[1:44:18] I'd like to sing a verse or two of Open
[1:44:20] Mine Eyes
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; that I may see glimpses of truth.
[1:44:29] You able to follow me this morning?
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; It's pretty simple, pretty elementary.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; You like the word?
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Hallelujah.
[1:44:46] Open mine eyes that I may see.
[1:44:53] Glimpses of truth thou has for me.
[1:45:00] Placing my hand to that wonder
[1:45:07] that shall last and set me free.
[1:45:14] Silently
[1:45:16] now I wait for thee.
[1:45:21] Ready my God I will to see.
[1:45:28] Open my eyes
[1:45:33] and
[1:45:35] see.
[1:45:41] [Music]
[1:45:42] Oh my
[1:45:49] voices of truth.
[1:45:56] And while the angels
[1:45:59] fall my ear,
[1:46:03] everything else will
[1:46:10] silently
[1:46:12] now I wait for thee.
[1:46:18] My God, I will
[1:46:22] sing.
[1:46:24] Open my eyes.
[1:46:27] [Music]
[1:46:38] Open my mouth and let me
[1:46:45] gladly
[1:46:48] truth everywhere.
[1:46:52] Open my heart and let me prepare
[1:46:59] love with my children
[1:47:02] [Music]
[1:47:04] to share.
[1:47:06] Silently
[1:47:09] I wait for thee.
[1:47:13] Ready my God I will to see.
[1:47:20] Open my eyes to you and me
[1:47:33] at this place junction in the service.
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:41] I believe there are those here that need
[1:47:43] to say, "Open my heart.
[1:47:48] open my heart that I may, you may not
[1:47:51] have agreed with everything I said
[1:47:53] today.
[1:47:55] But you need to say, "Open my heart
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; not to me,
[1:48:00] but to God that confirmed the word."
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Because friends, I can say
[1:48:09] I can say with a great deal of feeling
[1:48:11] this morning,
[1:48:13] you're just passing through this little
[1:48:15] short life.
[1:48:18] And it could be very brief.
[1:48:22] Sister Biscll and myself got in the car
[1:48:24] this morning and we started to drive.
[1:48:27] [Music]
[1:48:28] And of course, we're so mindful of the
[1:48:31] loss of our
[1:48:34] son-in-law
[1:48:36] said only two weeks ago, they stepped
[1:48:39] into a car and and within two hours the
[1:48:42] whole scene had changed. within 2 hours
[1:48:45] someone was on the other side and you
[1:48:47] have no guarantee that you'll even see
[1:48:51] this evening. You have no guarantee. And
[1:48:54] you say, "Well, you know those things.
[1:48:57] We've heard those things before."
[1:48:58] Listen, I'll tell you one thing in the
[1:49:00] authority of God's word. You're only
[1:49:01] living here once. And I don't care
[1:49:04] whether you live 5 minutes or 50 years.
[1:49:08] Every one of those we give an account
[1:49:11] for before God. how we live it. And the
[1:49:14] scripture says that and we'll give an
[1:49:16] account for what God has given us. God
[1:49:18] has given us an opportunity this morning
[1:49:20] to open our heart and let the divine
[1:49:23] Holy Spirit come in and take absolute
[1:49:26] control. We've been given an opportunity
[1:49:28] time after time in meetings and I know
[1:49:31] there are those that need to perhaps
[1:49:32] surrender their lives. Those that need
[1:49:34] to be delivered from habits of life,
[1:49:37] those that need to uh let loose of their
[1:49:39] own their own mind, their own thoughts
[1:49:43] and whatever it is, whatever it is, we
[1:49:45] have no we have no excuse in this kind
[1:49:48] of an atmosphere to live at something
[1:49:50] below what God has for us. And we need
[1:49:53] to open our heart and say, "Oh God,
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; give me the strength.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Give me the stamina. Give me the
[1:50:00] insight. Let me see life for what it is.
[1:50:03] Let me see my life for what it is. Let
[1:50:05] me see eternity. Let me peer into that
[1:50:08] realm. Oh God, let me be moved
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; by the word of the Lord. Let me be moved
[1:50:14] by the Holy Ghost. Let me be moved when
[1:50:17] I have this opportunity." People say,
[1:50:19] "I'll have it next week." You may not.
[1:50:22] And there's a good chance you won't
[1:50:24] because
[1:50:26] God gives you this opportunity and he's
[1:50:28] not obliged to give us at our time.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; This is his time. Today is the day of
[1:50:36] salvation. Today is the day when God is
[1:50:39] speaking. And I want to seize upon that
[1:50:42] opportunity. I'm sure this congregation
[1:50:44] will agree with me. This world is
[1:50:46] getting darker and darker and more
[1:50:49] deceptive all the time. Is it not? It's
[1:50:52] becoming more corrupted.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; I say thank God
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; for a word that's an anchor
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; to the soul. Thank God for a message
[1:51:02] that is made that has made foolish the
[1:51:05] wisdom of man.
[1:51:08] [Music]
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; And you'll see where I'm going to be
[1:51:15] going in another verse and another part
[1:51:17] of this
[1:51:19] message.
[1:51:21] What does God see?
[1:51:26] I don't really want to say this
[1:51:31] because I start off in uh my next
[1:51:33] message.
[1:51:35] But the first place that the Bible says,
[1:51:38] "And God looked
[1:51:41] and God looked,
[1:51:43] he looked upon the earth
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; and the Bible says and it was corrupted.
[1:51:50] says, "God saw and everything was good.
[1:51:54] Everything was very good cuz he'd made a
[1:51:58] little bit of what you saw in the clip
[1:52:01] and God saw.
[1:52:03] But then one day and God looked
[1:52:06] and the earth was corrupted."
[1:52:11] There's another phrase that we want to
[1:52:13] love and hold very dear.
[1:52:16] When I see the blood,
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; I'll pass over you.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; We can say, "Where is that blood today?"
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Where is it?
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; It's not back on Calvary. It's not on a
[1:52:31] wooden cross. It's not even on the
[1:52:33] ground.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; That blood is in his word.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; When I see the blood,
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; remember before it was blood on a
[1:52:42] doorpost. It was a spoken word. The
[1:52:45] blood was only the evidence of what was
[1:52:48] spoken. And when they heard the word and
[1:52:51] did what the word said, then God saw
[1:52:53] that it wasn't just the paint that was
[1:52:55] on the post. He saw that there was a
[1:52:57] people obedient to his word. I said, God
[1:53:02] sent his message, a vindicated
[1:53:04] messenger, and it is today the bleeding
[1:53:07] word. The bleeding word. And when I see
[1:53:10] that,
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; I'll pass over you. Amen.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; I say, "Glory be to God. Glory be to
[1:53:18] God. When I see that, I'll pass over
[1:53:21] you. Make sure you have that
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; and I'll pass over you."
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Christ my redeemer.
[1:53:37] 24:51.
[1:53:39] And we're going to close.
[1:53:42] Christ my redeemer
[1:53:46] died on the cross
[1:53:49] died for the sinner
[1:53:52] paid all his dash
[1:53:59] [Music]
[1:54:00] [Applause]
[1:54:03] will pass for You

[1:54:40] will he
[1:54:48] [Applause]
[1:54:48] [Music]
[1:54:51] for you.
[1:54:58] Heat. Heat.
[1:55:12] I pass
[1:55:15] [Music]
[1:55:17] [Applause]
[1:55:17] [Music]
[1:55:21] all
[1:55:24] each one
[1:55:28] through
[1:55:30] hide in the saving
[1:55:34] blood
[1:55:35] and I will pass will pass for Heat.
[1:55:41] Heat.
[1:55:53] When I
[1:55:56] see the
[1:56:00] pass, I will pass for you.
[1:56:07] When I sat on a log,
[1:56:11] I stand as a testimony
[1:56:14] and looked in the eyes of that prophet,
[1:56:20] precious brother Brandham.
[1:56:22] And all he said was,
[1:56:25] [Music]
[1:56:27] I believe you have three questions. Said
[1:56:30] he came to me this afternoon. I believe
[1:56:33] you have three questions.
[1:56:35] Before he opened his mouth,
[1:56:38] I knew I was so exposed.
[1:56:41] And the thought that passed through my
[1:56:42] mind, and I'll never never forget it, to
[1:56:44] my dying day. There is nothing I can
[1:56:47] hide. I am naked from my earliest memory
[1:56:52] of anything in my life. I'm naked. I
[1:56:55] stand in his presence naked.
[1:56:59] I'm glad he didn't start saying,
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; "I see you when you're in sin.
[1:57:05] I see you going to the hunts. I see you
[1:57:08] going to places. I see you thinking
[1:57:11] things you shouldn't think.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; I see you doing all of this wicked
[1:57:15] things. But when it came under the
[1:57:17] optics of the prophet messenger, you
[1:57:21] have three questions.
[1:57:23] He asked three questions on baptism and
[1:57:26] on the godhead and on the serpent seed
[1:57:29] and then went into the scripture and
[1:57:31] those prophet optics went from my heart
[1:57:33] into the word of God and answered all of
[1:57:36] those questions. I say my brother,
[1:57:39] sister, a God that can take a leaf and
[1:57:42] come from a 100 million light years and
[1:57:44] come down until that leaf that isn't
[1:57:46] little insignificant just minute
[1:57:49] microscopic little things and all of the
[1:57:51] color that's there. I'm glad that that
[1:57:53] God can look down into our heart and
[1:57:56] take all the layers away and peel all of
[1:58:00] that aside. And my brother, my sister,
[1:58:03] he's not examining. He's looking at the
[1:58:05] blood. Amen.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; The bleeding word.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; And even when we didn't know how to
[1:58:12] believe it, he saw the desire and the
[1:58:15] call of God said, "Blessed are you. It's
[1:58:18] given to you
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; to understand
[1:58:22] the mysteries of the kingdom."
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, how we love him.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; How we love him today. I just love him
[1:58:28] with everything that's in my heart,
[1:58:30] friends. So glad.
[1:58:36] Oh great compassion.
[1:58:38] And we're going to close.
[1:58:44] [Applause]
[1:58:54] [Music]
[1:58:57] I
[1:59:00] [Music]
[1:59:03] for you
[1:59:06] when I
[1:59:09] see the blood
[1:59:12] when I
[1:59:15] see the blood.
[1:59:24] I will pass. I will pass over you.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you, Father.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; We just want to please you, Lord.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; We want to please you with all that is
[1:59:38] in our hearts.
[1:59:40] I am coming, Lord Jesus, asking in your
[1:59:45] name.
[1:59:46] You the one who uttered these words,
[1:59:49] they were scribed in the scripture by
[1:59:52] Matthew and you told the many parables
[1:59:55] of the kingdom of heaven. Oh God, let
[1:59:58] the supernatural element come to us at
[2:00:01] the people. We are the children of this
[2:00:03] end age. There's not going to be another
[2:00:06] one.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Not another message. There will not be
[2:00:11] another message like this ever.
[2:00:15] You said, "Oh God, you'll send these
[2:00:18] seven, the eyes of the Lord."
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, how you've looked down, Father, into
[2:00:26] the innermost region of our hearts.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; And Lord, the day came when we had a
[2:00:32] sense of conviction and we surrendered
[2:00:34] our lives. And now today, we pray that
[2:00:37] you'll give us spiritual insight,
[2:00:40] spiritual understanding. and I'm
[2:00:42] burdened. Lord, I'm praying for those
[2:00:45] that are standing here that are in need.
[2:00:47] Don't let them walk out of here in need.
[2:00:49] Don't let them walk out of here bound.
[2:00:51] Don't let them walk out of here in a
[2:00:53] confusion or in darkness. I pray that
[2:00:56] you will give such insight, Lord, and
[2:00:58] give them courage to surrender now. Say,
[2:01:02] Lord, I give you myself
[2:01:05] and all that I am.
[2:01:07] the name of Jesus Christ. I pray,
[2:01:10] Father, that as the people leave the
[2:01:13] sanctuary
[2:01:15] or as they remain before you in prayer,
[2:01:18] I pray that you will continue whether
[2:01:20] they leave or whether they stay. I pray
[2:01:22] that you will continue by the Holy Ghost
[2:01:26] to indelibly mark and brand their souls
[2:01:30] with the truth of your word.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name, I ask it.
[2:01:36] [Music]
[2:01:38] Amen.
[2:01:40] I'd like to just sing with you before
[2:01:41] you go. Pleasing.
[2:01:44] Pleasing.
[2:01:47] I want our life to be pleasing.
[2:01:52] Pleasing.
[2:01:58] Let me be pleasing
[2:02:02] to you.
[2:02:04] Let everything
[2:02:08] that I do, oh God,
[2:02:15] you
[2:02:18] praise.
[2:02:21] [Music]
[2:02:23] and everything
[2:02:26] I pursue
[2:02:36] to you.
[2:02:38] And let's be praying for one another as
[2:02:40] we sing it once again and shake hands.
[2:02:42] Please, please,
[2:02:47] let me be pleasing
[2:02:51] to you.
[2:02:52] [Music]
[2:02:53] Let everything
[2:02:56] that I do
[2:03:00] be pleasing
[2:03:03] to you. I pray for you. Pray.
[2:03:09] [Music]
[2:03:11] Let everything
[2:03:14] I pursue
[2:03:17] be pleasing.
[2:03:21] Lord
[2:03:23] to you.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; You're all dismissed in the name of the
[2:03:28] Lord Jesus Christ. If you're in need of
[2:03:31] prayer, you can come. There's brethren
[2:03:33] here to pray with you. Don't leave here
[2:03:35] bound, hindered, fettered.
[2:03:38] God will meet you here. Brother Tom,
[2:03:41] could you please Brother Tony? Brother,
[2:03:46] yes. Amen. God bless you.
[2:03:50] Amen. Hallelujah.

[2:04:11] Amen.
[2:04:14] [Music]
[2:04:24] Christmas.
[2:04:29] [Music]
[2:04:53] Hallelujah.
[2:04:56] All
[2:04:59] my God
[2:05:02] is present in the house. Amen.

[2:05:43] Good morning.
