[8:33] Oh, what a change.
[8:39] Amen.
[8:42] Thank you, Lord. I'm asking Brother Tom
[8:44] Frey, Brother Tom, if you'd come just
[8:46] open the service in a word of prayer. We
[8:48] have no prayer requests here or prayer
[8:50] cloths. If you have a need, just raise
[8:52] your hand as we go. If you're on the
[8:53] telephone or on the hookup, just raise
[8:55] your hand as well. Tom,
[9:02] bow our heads, please.
[9:06] Precious Lord, we want to come into your
[9:08] presence, Lord. Father, we know that
[9:11] Lord, in this day and age, oh God, Satan
[9:13] is your enemy. He is our enemy, Lord.
[9:18] And Lord, there's not one thing he'd
[9:19] like more than to ruin our fellowship
[9:21] tonight, Lord. Lord, he'll use the
[9:24] memory channel. He'll use mistakes that
[9:26] we made today and things that we've
[9:28] done, Lord, to get in the way. And we
[9:30] just want to, Lord, each one lay those
[9:32] things on the table, Lord. We don't want
[9:35] nothing to come between you and us,
[9:37] Lord. Father, we want to be free to
[9:39] worship you, Lord. Free to give you
[9:40] glory and honor and praise. Lord, you're
[9:44] the alone, the only one that's worthy,
[9:46] oh God, of any praise that we might
[9:48] have. Lord, Father, if our thoughts have
[9:50] been on things of today and things of
[9:53] yesterday and things of tomorrow, Lord,
[9:55] we just lay them down as vain, Lord, and
[9:58] empty, Lord, we know that only you can
[10:00] satisfy those things we need, Lord.
[10:03] Father God, there's not a person in this
[10:05] room that doesn't have a need, Lord.
[10:08] Father, whether it be in in their
[10:10] physical life, Lord, whether it be
[10:11] spiritual, Lord, whether it be mental,
[10:14] Father, I just remember my wife at home
[10:16] sick, Lord, and and one of my children,
[10:18] Lord.
[10:21] Father, I know you're the healer.
[10:24] Lord, and and just so many more things
[10:27] that we can say tonight, Lord, that are
[10:29] needs, Lord. But Lord, we know that you
[10:32] paid the price on Calvary, Lord, so that
[10:34] we wouldn't have to to fight the
[10:36] battles, Lord. You said that you'll take
[10:38] up arms for us, Lord. Lord, you said to
[10:41] just stand still. And Lord, that you
[10:43] would move. And so, Lord, we lay
[10:46] everything right on this table, Lord
[10:48] God. Father, that the man of God would
[10:51] not be hindered, Lord. That there be
[10:53] nothing, oh God, that would hinder the
[10:54] word that's to come forth tonight, Lord.
[10:57] Father, we don't know what you have
[10:58] prepared for us, oh God. But we're
[11:00] willing, oh God, to lay everything down
[11:02] that you can give us, oh God, what you
[11:04] desire. And we just pray for the man of
[11:07] God for strength, Lord, that as he
[11:09] stands behind this pulpit, oh God, he
[11:11] might have freedom and liberty,
[11:13] strengthen his body, oh God, to just get
[11:15] himself out of the way, Lord, that you
[11:17] might receive all the glory tonight.
[11:20] Bless everyone that hears this service,
[11:22] Lord, whether they're in this assembly,
[11:24] whether they're on the internet, or
[11:26] whether they hear it months away. Lord,
[11:28] may you just bless the word that goes
[11:29] forth from this desk tonight in Jesus
[11:32] name. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[11:36] Amen. You may move your seats.
[11:44] Amen. God bless you. It's good to have
[11:45] everyone here this evening. As I
[11:47] mentioned earlier, if you're on the
[11:48] telephone hookup or on the internet, we
[11:50] want to say God bless you. It's good you
[11:52] could join us. Our brother uh Nathan
[11:54] Hildbrand and his father and I think

[17:52] of the few. One of the few. Number 79 on
[17:54] the screen.

[20:53] Lisa, nice to see you. Amen.
[20:56] Every promise.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[20:59] &gt;&gt; Of course you do. Otherwise, you
[21:01] wouldn't be here.
[21:04] Every promise. Maybe you're going to
[21:06] hear about some tonight.
[21:11] Promise in the book is mine.
[21:16] Every chapter, every verse, every line.
[21:21] I am trusting in his love.
[21:27] Every promise in the book is mine.
[21:32] Every promise in the book is mine.
[21:37] Every chapter, every verse, every line,
[21:43] I am trusting in his love divine.
[21:48] Every promise in the book is mine.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; Now, we're just going to loosen up.
[21:57] We're going to believe for every word
[21:59] that we have need of. We want to make it
[22:01] personal. Now, in preparation for the
[22:04] word, I look across the congregation,
[22:07] even though I've been gone for some
[22:08] days, I know there's needs
[22:12] and you know that there's a need. And
[22:14] so, I just want you to not only lift
[22:16] your heart, maybe you want to just lift
[22:18] your hand, say, "Every promise I need, I
[22:22] have something I'm here for tonight.
[22:26] I'm here for a spiritual purpose
[22:29] and I'm claiming the everlasting word of
[22:32] God.
[22:34] Every promise in the book is mine.
[22:40] Every chapter, every verse, every
[22:45] I am trusting his love.
[22:51] Every promise in the book is mine.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Oh gracious heavenly father, how lovely
[22:59] you are. How wonderful is your presence
[23:03] and the and that we can come and are
[23:05] invited to come into your divine
[23:09] majesty, Lord, into the presence of the
[23:13] eternal God, the only true and living
[23:16] God. There is none other beside you.
[23:19] You're the God of Israel, the God of
[23:21] Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of
[23:23] Jacob, the God and father of our Lord
[23:26] Jesus Christ that sent him as a
[23:28] propitiation for us. You're the God that
[23:31] stood by your prophet in this
[23:33] generation. And you're alive tonight.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; You're You have ears to hear and a mouth
[23:39] to speak, eyes to see. Look down, oh
[23:43] God, into our hearts and see our
[23:46] individual cry in need and hear our cry.
[23:50] And now, Father, as we approach the
[23:52] word, I pray that you'll bless this
[23:54] gathering of people. We've gathered to
[23:57] meet with you, not to hear man or not to
[24:01] see one another, but we've gathered to
[24:03] hear from you.
[24:05] May your will be done on earth as it is
[24:07] in heaven. in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[24:11] And amen.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; It was so nice to see on the screen see
[24:18] our brother, I believe, Walder
[24:20] Hilderbrand singing with Nathan and
[24:22] Jonathan. God bless you. So nice to see
[24:27] and have you here. Also, Brother Tom and
[24:29] Sister Marilyn Brown are here visiting.
[24:32] Very, very short. One thing, they
[24:35] they're truly like the wind. They come
[24:38] in and barely get to shake their hand.
[24:41] They're gone. I guess they're leaving
[24:43] tomorrow. But Sister Marjorie Miles was
[24:46] so kind and had us over and we were able
[24:49] to reminisce. And believe me, we have a
[24:52] lot to reminisce about. We We've got a
[24:55] long long history. And it' been just
[24:57] wonderful to to you know what's you know
[25:00] what's wonderful to talk about it is
[25:02] because you just keep confirming how
[25:05] faithful he is.
[25:07] He's faithful.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; He's faithful. Amen. Good see, brother
[25:11] Ken. Sister Jillian, God bless you. God
[25:14] will honor that. Amen. Hallelujah.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Well, it's good to be back and we're not
[25:20] going to delay the service, but
[25:23] you know, God is God just a wonderful
[25:26] God. I wouldn't want to serve anyone
[25:28] else.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; Some years ago, I had a call from a
[25:35] pastor
[25:36] He said, "My son
[25:39] is just in total rebellion and he's
[25:42] against me. He's against what we stand
[25:44] for. He's against what we preach. He's
[25:47] against everything."
[25:49] He said, "Uh
[25:52] um I'm going to put him out of the
[25:54] house." He said, "I I'm calling you to
[25:58] just see what you think." I said, "Don't
[26:00] do it. Don't do it." I said, "You know,
[26:03] where might you put him?"
[26:05] And I said, "He he needs to respect the
[26:08] Christ, which is this gospel. He needs
[26:10] to respect Christ, but I wouldn't cast
[26:13] him out onto the street or wherever."
[26:16] Anyway, I'm not going to go into a lot
[26:19] of detail.
[26:20] He said, "Would you talk to him?" I
[26:22] said, "Yeah, I sure will." So, I had a
[26:26] had a long counseling time with him and
[26:31] I just told him, I said, "Listen, you
[26:32] know, you we're not trying to make you
[26:34] be a believer. We're not trying to make
[26:37] you a Christian. We're not trying to
[26:39] give you a revelation. We can't. God has
[26:41] to do that. But you need to honor the
[26:45] faith of your mother and father. You
[26:47] need to respect them. And they will
[26:49] always be your mother and father. If you
[26:51] get married, they'll be your wife's
[26:53] mother and father-in-law. And if you
[26:55] have children, they'll be your grandpa,
[26:57] their grandparents. And I said, "You'll
[26:59] never change that." So I said, "You
[27:01] better just, you know, have to come to
[27:04] terms with that." Make a long story
[27:07] short, that was some years ago. And God
[27:11] God, he's not interested in five minutes
[27:13] or just what happens tonight. He's
[27:15] interested in your life. He's interested
[27:17] in where you're going. He's prepared a
[27:19] place for us.
[27:21] And uh
[27:23] the pastor told me, he said, "I I I I
[27:26] just came to the point." I said, "He's
[27:28] coming 21 years old. When he comes 21,
[27:31] I'm going to put him out." Two days
[27:34] before he was 21.
[27:38] Just two days before he had hooked up
[27:39] with a girl. This girl was from overseas
[27:43] from Europe here like exchange student
[27:45] and got work and got immigration and
[27:48] they got together and they were you know
[27:52] really thick together and the pastor
[27:54] told me he said you couldn't have put a
[27:56] tighter pair of pants on anybody than
[27:58] that girl wore and just everything that
[28:02] we're opposed to she was. And two days
[28:06] before he's going to put them out and he
[28:08] just hated to do it.
[28:11] The boy walked up to him and says, "I'm
[28:14] getting married and I want you to marry
[28:16] us."
[28:18] He said, "Wow." He said, 'You know how I
[28:20] was going to do that?
[28:23] And so he called he called another
[28:26] pastor. He said, "What should I do?"
[28:28] That pastor said, "Marry him. You're the
[28:29] best one to do it. You know, you're the
[28:32] only one that can really do it."
[28:34] &gt;&gt; So he married him. And now she came in
[28:37] the environment of of the Holy Holy
[28:40] Spirit and the word of God. And uh they
[28:44] decided to come to church
[28:47] and he came to church and that pastor's
[28:51] son God got a hold of him. He'd been
[28:54] raised in it since a baby and God got a
[28:57] hold of him. He hit the platform and
[28:59] started sobbing his soul out. And this
[29:02] unsaved girl who he just married came up
[29:06] and laid her hand on him and started
[29:08] praying for him.
[29:10] And the pastor, you know, we know we
[29:12] know how everything's supposed to go,
[29:14] right?
[29:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "This isn't right." You know,
[29:17] and here she is praying her heart out
[29:19] for for him and she need prayer. Well,
[29:21] they just make it all short. In a few
[29:23] days, they baptized her.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; And in the last service I spoke, they
[29:28] sat right there,
[29:29] &gt;&gt; both of them, right in front. and he
[29:32] wanted to see me and we went into study
[29:34] and he said I never had an opportunity
[29:37] to formally thank you but he said when
[29:40] you had that talk with me said that
[29:42] helped me a whole lot so sometimes it
[29:45] can just be a simple a few words but if
[29:49] God's behind it
[29:50] &gt;&gt; amen hallelujah and I just want to tell
[29:53] you one more thing too because I know
[29:55] it'll be a lot of interest to you
[29:57] brother Ron Spencer I didn't know but
[29:59] brother Ron the doctors had told him
[30:01] medical people had told him that he had
[30:03] damaged his lungs and I had said here
[30:05] that he to my knowledge he had not
[30:07] damaged his lungs but they said that he
[30:10] had damaged his lungs and had lost I
[30:12] think don't quote me but I think it was
[30:14] around 60 or 70% of the use of his lungs
[30:19] and he said that in normal daily life he
[30:21] was just very very short of breath he
[30:22] would have to stop and sit down and he
[30:24] couldn't manage and and on a Friday
[30:27] night I believe it was in North Carolina
[30:29] in the meeting in North Carolina.
[30:31] Uh the the the atmosphere, the people
[30:35] responding to the word atmosphere just
[30:37] turned electric
[30:39] and uh I called on anyone to stand at
[30:43] that moment and he stood he responded
[30:45] immediately. He said he said, "Brother
[30:48] Biscuit," he said, "I threw both hands
[30:50] into the air." He said, and I said, God,
[30:53] I believe it's the same God speaking
[30:56] that spoke in creation and is speaking
[30:58] here and I receive this. He said, I open
[31:01] my mouth to take a breath and he said it
[31:04] was like a force, a force, a physical
[31:07] force came down like a wind and filled
[31:11] his chest and his lungs. He felt like he
[31:13] was going to burst. And he says it left
[31:16] him at that instant. His his
[31:19] father-in-law said to me, his
[31:21] father-in-law said he came over to me on
[31:24] the platform. He said, "He's a different
[31:25] man since that since that last Friday.
[31:29] He's a totally different man." And you
[31:31] know what, friends? I hope you come
[31:33] expecting tonight. God is real. We don't
[31:36] serve a God of dead wood, stone, formal
[31:40] doctrines of something. We have a living
[31:42] God. This is a vindicated message.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. and we're thankful for it.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're just so thankful and uh
[31:51] I I want to announce that uh I and my
[31:54] family going to be away for some
[31:56] vacation time and some rest just now and
[31:58] then I have to go on and we'll be
[32:00] speaking in in uh Ukraine and in
[32:03] Switzerland. But, uh we're going to have
[32:07] uh uh we're going to begin with two
[32:09] services on se on September the 28th,
[32:12] Sunday the 28th. as we'll begin on two
[32:15] with two services again and on on that
[32:20] day we're going to have the Lord's
[32:21] supper and communion as well and so we
[32:24] want you to be looking forward to that
[32:25] and praying towards that. Brother Lance
[32:28] Laru and brother John Andy's will be
[32:31] taking the lion's share of the ministry
[32:34] uh while both brother Tom and I are
[32:36] away. And if you have any spiritual
[32:38] need, I tell you these brothers know
[32:41] God. They know how to pray. We have
[32:43] other ministers that are here as well.
[32:46] But they will be giving themselves to
[32:48] the word, to the ministry, and the care
[32:50] of the church, the people. You've been
[32:53] well cared for.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[32:58] I want to have you turn in John's gospel
[33:00] if you would please. And I'm I'm going
[33:02] to watch the time. I realize that the
[33:05] school has just started once again.
[33:07] Sorry I missed the opportunity to pray
[33:09] with the children, but uh
[33:13] I know God will be with them. In John's
[33:16] gospel, the second chapter, please,
[33:19] we'll start at the 13th verse.
[33:25] Oh, I have
[33:28] friends. There's just so much that's
[33:29] been happening of a supernatural nature.
[33:34] Just believe.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; Will you just have faith and believe?
[33:38] God is doing far more than I could take
[33:40] and relate in the next couple of hours
[33:42] literally both home and abroad.
[33:46] Amen.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; And we want it to continue tonight.
[33:49] Amen.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; I didn't come here just to take fill in
[33:52] a Sunday evening service.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; I mean, or Wednesday evening service.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Starting at the 13th verse. And the Jews
[34:01] Passover was at hand. And Jesus went up
[34:04] to Jerusalem and found in the temple
[34:06] those that sold oxen and sheep and doves
[34:09] and the changers of money sitting. And
[34:12] when he had made a scourge of small
[34:14] cords, he drove them all out of the
[34:17] temple. and the sheep and the oxen, and
[34:20] poured out the changers money, and
[34:22] overthrew the tables, and said unto them
[34:25] that sold doves, take these things
[34:27] hence, make not my father's house, and
[34:30] house of merchandise. And his disciples
[34:33] remembered that it was written, the zeal
[34:35] of thine house hath eaten me up. Then
[34:38] answered the Jews, and said unto him,
[34:41] What sign showest thou unto us, seeing
[34:44] that thou doest these things? Jesus
[34:46] answered and said unto them, Destroy
[34:49] this temple, and in 3 days I will raise
[34:51] it up. Then said the Jews, 40 and 6
[34:54] years was the temple in building, and
[34:56] wilt thou rear it up in three days? But
[34:58] he spake but he spake unto the uh he
[35:02] spake of the temple of his body. Amen.
[35:06] God bless you. You may be seated.
[35:13] I want to I want your attention
[35:16] and just as little movement as possible,
[35:18] please. I want to speak to you on the
[35:22] zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
[35:28] It's quite a quite a subject. The zeal
[35:33] of thine house hath eaten me up.
[35:39] This zeal
[35:41] can be both negative and positive. Can
[35:44] be indignation,
[35:46] can be envy, can be jealousy, something
[35:49] that's eating a person up.
[35:52] But zeal on the positive side,
[35:55] can be a fervorance of spirit,
[35:59] of earnest, sincerity,
[36:02] desperation,
[36:04] all of these things. pursuing, defending
[36:07] anything is a zeal on behalf of
[36:10] something. And I think of today that
[36:13] people have uh goals and they have they
[36:17] have objectives. They have uh a cause
[36:21] and uh it it's everything to them. I
[36:25] think of the Olympics that just uh
[36:27] concluded and I was trying to conceive
[36:29] in my mind. I read a little article that
[36:32] a a a person reported and and they said,
[36:36] you know, one thing that we don't have
[36:38] to watch this for, you know, however
[36:41] many uh uh sessions they have or or
[36:44] games they have of of the NBA or hockey
[36:48] or something else. At least we don't
[36:49] have to watch this, you know, day after
[36:52] day after day. Of course, we don't have
[36:53] to anyway, but that's what she was
[36:55] expressing. And this uh sports reporter,
[36:58] she said, you know, they just come and
[37:00] they're here for uh two weeks uh for and
[37:04] then we don't see them again. They pass
[37:06] off the scene and we don't see them for
[37:08] another four years. And then they're
[37:10] there for two weeks and they all pass
[37:12] off the scene and they're they're we
[37:15] don't see them or hear of them hardly
[37:16] for another four years and then they
[37:19] reappear. these all of these uh uh o
[37:23] Olympic you know the athletes and I got
[37:27] thinking of I've been pondering about
[37:29] that just a little bit thinking just
[37:31] think four years but I tell you what
[37:33] they don't forget it
[37:35] &gt;&gt; they're remembering it every morning
[37:38] &gt;&gt; when it's over they're up the next
[37:39] morning maybe at 5:00 or 6:00 and they
[37:42] didn't change their diet they're staying
[37:44] right with that diet cuz they've got
[37:46] four years down the road they're going
[37:48] to be there again. I was just bronze
[37:50] this time or maybe I came sixth this
[37:52] time. I'm going to make it next time.
[37:55] I'm going to stand on that podium next
[37:57] time. And they they're you talk about a
[37:59] cause. They're absolutely fanatically
[38:03] dedicated and given over to it for what?
[38:05] Just a few moments standing there with a
[38:08] piece of metal around their neck. And
[38:10] I'm not I'm not degrading them. I'm not
[38:12] diminishing them. That's that's their
[38:14] life. That's their cause. If they can do
[38:17] that
[38:18] &gt;&gt; for that kind of crown, that little
[38:21] fading thing and they may fade off and
[38:24] not even be there four years later and
[38:26] the world will forget them unless
[38:28] they're, you know, somebody of an
[38:30] outstanding
[38:31] uh world record or something. But to
[38:34] think that it is within a person, they
[38:38] have the wherewithal and you have it
[38:41] &gt;&gt; for a much different cause and a much
[38:44] different purpose in life. And and we I
[38:47] if they should if they should settle
[38:50] back, they certainly aren't going to
[38:52] stand on any podium and win anything,
[38:54] win any prize. They they have that we we
[38:58] have also, you know, we may be having an
[39:01] election. They they they talk about it
[39:03] in Canada and they're in the midst of
[39:05] one in the United States. They're
[39:06] they're going to be choosing a new
[39:09] president in November. And you talk
[39:12] about a cause. You talk about people
[39:15] crossing the country, campaigning,
[39:17] wearing themselves out. You think my
[39:19] voice is horse? They lose their voices.
[39:22] They're screaming. They're yelling.
[39:23] They're they're trying to uh win votes
[39:26] over. They're trying to talk to people.
[39:28] They're they're committed to it to what?
[39:30] a political party.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron Spencer, I think he shocked
[39:36] his people and all. He said, "Just
[39:38] think." He said, "The people were up
[39:40] this morning at early 4, 5:00 in the
[39:43] morning already lining up to hear
[39:45] someone stand up and speak and tell them
[39:47] a bunch of lies."
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; True.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; And not that they intend to do it, but
[39:57] even the prophet, he tells it very, very
[39:59] clearly. good men. Even priests go
[40:02] priests, he says, they go into the
[40:03] priesthood not to be bad people, to be
[40:05] good. And none doesn't go in to be a bad
[40:08] woman. Goes in to be a good person. But
[40:10] the system corrupts them because the
[40:13] systems are corrupt
[40:14] &gt;&gt; because man is at the bottom of it. Do
[40:17] you believe that?
[40:18] &gt;&gt; All right. I want you to respond then if
[40:20] you really believe it. You say sickum
[40:22] tonight and I'm going to preach.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; And people are people have good
[40:25] intentions, but they have a cause. I'm
[40:28] talking about a cause. If anybody has a
[40:31] cause, it's the believers of this
[40:32] message. We have a cause. We have a
[40:36] purpose in this world.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; We're not here to be idol. We're not
[40:42] here to just ride the wave. We're here
[40:44] to be aggressive. We're here to be
[40:47] zealous.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; We've got something to be zealous about.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; I don't have to pump you up. The Holy
[40:53] Spirit will pump you up.
[40:56] He'll make real to you. Just yield
[40:58] yourself to him
[40:59] &gt;&gt; even now. Don't wait for tomorrow. Even
[41:02] now,
[41:02] &gt;&gt; if you happen to need that, and I
[41:04] believe we all do.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; We all do.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; To be fervent.
[41:11] People get, and I'm just going to take a
[41:13] moment with this, but they get so
[41:16] fervent with their campaigning and their
[41:20] politics and their volunteering programs
[41:22] and community projects and and we get a
[41:26] little rag paper comes to our desk, our
[41:28] door rather, a couple times uh a week
[41:31] and and I leaf through the thing and and
[41:33] I'm just amazed how people get so
[41:35] engaged in community projects and what
[41:39] they will do and how hard they will work
[41:41] and how they give themselves to it. And
[41:44] I just think, you know, some of that's
[41:45] not even in in believers.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; They don't work at this. They don't come
[41:50] just a, you know, on a Sunday or
[41:52] something. They're working at this all
[41:54] the time and giving themselves of every
[41:56] every bit of time they may have. They
[41:58] squeeze that time. They sacrifice.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; They sacrifice themselves. Nobody has to
[42:04] beg them. They want to do it
[42:06] &gt;&gt; because they believe in a cause. So, it
[42:08] really boils down, do we believe in
[42:10] this?
[42:11] Do we really believe in this?
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that we do.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; And we live, we live at this at this
[42:21] time. All of us have become accustomed,
[42:24] I believe, one way or another. But we
[42:26] are living in a world that is under a
[42:29] cloud of paranoia.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:34] You young people are being reared in a
[42:36] &gt;&gt; in a society that's already filled with
[42:40] fear
[42:41] &gt;&gt; and you're you're accustomed to it. You
[42:42] become accustomed to it. I can't get
[42:45] accustomed to the fact when I go through
[42:48] uh uh go through an airport and I've
[42:50] said it here before. Go through an
[42:52] airport
[42:54] and I tell you what, you're just so many
[42:57] cattle going down the chute.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Take your belt off. Take your shoes off,
[43:04] you know. Take your jacket off. Put it
[43:06] there. No, don't put it there. Take your
[43:08] computer out and do this. What is that?
[43:11] Have you got anything?
[43:13] Got anything sharp? We got a little
[43:16] razor like this. Hardly cuts my beard.
[43:19] Take it out. You can't take that. This
[43:22] is fanaticism.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; How many people have they caught?
[43:33] Listen.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; 19 men
[43:37] change the whole world.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; 19 men change the world you're living
[43:43] in.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; 19 men are forcing you to do a whole lot
[43:47] of things and will continue to do a lot
[43:49] of things you never dreamed you'd ever
[43:51] do. 19 men who believed in a cause
[43:58] &gt;&gt; invented the world word terrorism almost
[44:02] every day you hear it everywhere you
[44:05] hear it and it's infiltrated every
[44:08] aspect of your life your home
[44:12] &gt;&gt; true
[44:12] &gt;&gt; your countrymen
[44:14] &gt;&gt; my life every country every person 19
[44:19] men did it
[44:22] I know of the 11 men
[44:28] &gt;&gt; that changed the face of the world.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Zeal,
[44:35] &gt;&gt; commitment,
[44:38] &gt;&gt; you can call it fanaticism if you want.
[44:40] I call it the Holy Ghost.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; They got full of the Holy Ghost and they
[44:46] did what they could where they could.
[44:48] Amen.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; It didn't have to have a big title.
[44:52] Some of them didn't even get included
[44:55] &gt;&gt; hardly in the scriptures of what they
[44:57] did, but they believed in what they were
[44:59] doing. They believed in it.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; We believe in this message, do we not?
[45:04] &gt;&gt; And that happens to be an earmark of the
[45:07] believers all down through history. If
[45:10] they if they really believed it, they
[45:13] were committed to it, they were given
[45:15] over to it, and they wouldn't allow
[45:17] anything to take it out of them.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; You think that these Muslims that are so
[45:25] fanatically given over, you think these
[45:28] suicide bombers, you think they You
[45:30] think that you could convince them
[45:32] otherwise? Never.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Never. You couldn't convince them any
[45:36] other way because they're more committed
[45:38] than you that than perhaps you are to
[45:41] get them out of it.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Even if you had the opportunity to try
[45:45] to talk them out of it, you can't
[45:46] persuade them out of it because they're
[45:48] completely given. So you can just say,
[45:50] "Oh, it's a spirit." Oh, that doesn't
[45:52] work with me because we have the Holy
[45:55] Spirit.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; We have the Holy Spirit.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; We are to have the Holy Spirit. And the
[46:01] Holy Spirit's more aggressive than that
[46:03] spirit.
[46:04] Can you say amen?
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; We have the Holy Spirit and he's called
[46:08] baptized with the Holy Ghost and
[46:11] &gt;&gt; fire.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Say it again.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Fire.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Fire can be a a a burning blaze that
[46:19] catches the attention of the people.
[46:21] Fire can also be a quiet, unheard,
[46:25] almost un unseen, almost invisible, but
[46:29] it's a burning ember
[46:31] &gt;&gt; and it'll remain hot. Some substances
[46:33] remain hot. Just hot. Just white hot.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; They don't have to have a whole lot of,
[46:40] you know, fuel to them. They just remain
[46:43] hot. I can tell you some believers are
[46:46] um perhaps, you know, they're more uh uh
[46:50] demonstrative
[46:52] and and others are quiet. Some burn real
[46:56] fast and others burn slow, but they burn
[47:00] long and they're faithful. You see them
[47:02] year in and year out and nothing
[47:05] changes. What is it? It's a fire.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; It's a flame. It's an ember.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; And you can see it all through the
[47:12] scriptures.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:19] When you read when we read uh Hebrews
[47:22] the 11th chapter, you can't read Hebrews
[47:25] the 11th chapter
[47:28] without feeling the burning devotion of
[47:32] those heroes of faith.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Your heart must be stirred when you read
[47:38] and hear. And what shall I say more?
[47:40] Paul says, what shall I more say? For
[47:43] the time would fail me to tell of Gideon
[47:45] and of Barack and of Samson and of Jeffy
[47:47] and of David also and Samuel and the
[47:50] prophets who through faith they subdued
[47:52] kingdoms and wrought righteousness,
[47:55] obtained promises and stopped the mouths
[47:57] of lions. I don't think what Paul is
[47:59] writing here and what God thought of
[48:02] these people that wasn't the headlines
[48:04] in the newspaper.
[48:07] They weren't saying it from the from the
[48:10] public or from the reigning kingdom at
[48:13] that time or from the political system.
[48:15] They weren't saying these people have
[48:17] these people have wrought righteousness.
[48:19] These people have done they said these
[48:21] are a bunch of fanatics.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Ben used many
[48:25] times these are holy rollers.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid of some reproachful
[48:31] sentence
[48:32] &gt;&gt; or claim upon you. Amen. Amen.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; And they quenched the violence of fire
[48:39] and escaped the edge of the sword. And
[48:41] out of weakness was made strong. And
[48:42] they waxed valiant in fight and turned
[48:45] to flight the armies of the aliens.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; You know, you're quiet. I'm going to
[48:55] preach till I've got the flames going
[48:57] burning,
[48:59] burning high and burning hot
[49:03] until some zeal is I'm going to stoke
[49:05] some fires tonight.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah,
[49:14] and I'm just going through two or three
[49:15] of these examples. Jeremiah, he found
[49:18] that the word of God in him. And we are
[49:22] the people who go around saying we're
[49:24] the word made flesh today.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; All right. If that is the truth and that
[49:29] is the case, it will definitely show.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah was one. And he even said he
[49:37] said to the Lord, you you I've been
[49:39] deceived. You know, he felt he'd been
[49:42] brought into something and led into a
[49:44] certain way. And he he he kind of
[49:47] predicted he thought which direction it
[49:49] was going to go and how it would be in
[49:51] his life. And then he found it was going
[49:52] to be different because he found it
[49:54] brought such reproaches and brought such
[49:56] hardship upon him. And then he decided I
[49:59] won't speak of this anymore. I won't
[50:02] speak of it. I won't say it. And he said
[50:04] then I said I will not make mention of
[50:06] him. I'm just not going to make mention
[50:09] of him nor speak anymore in his name.
[50:12] I'm not going to do it. But I'm not
[50:13] going to declare this word of the Lord
[50:16] anymore. He says, "But his word was in
[50:21] my heart as a burning fire shut up in my
[50:25] bones."
[50:27] &gt;&gt; It's the same word.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; The same word that had that was in
[50:31] Jeremiah. It's the same word. Same God.
[50:35] You believe it? Same God that's here
[50:37] tonight. Exactly. Don't put him back
[50:40] there. He's here right now. Don't say I
[50:42] will be. Say I am. I am that word. I
[50:46] can't shut it up.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Got to allow God. Let the breeze and the
[50:52] wind of the Holy Spirit Amen.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; I believe that we ought to agree here
[50:58] tonight. our services. We're not just
[51:00] here for one service, but our church,
[51:02] the services, and the brother next to me
[51:05] and the sister next to me, it's going to
[51:07] be different
[51:08] &gt;&gt; because by the power of by the power of
[51:10] our own faith, we're going to change one
[51:13] another.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; We're going to have an effect, a
[51:15] positive effect on one another.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Because we're not content to be where we
[51:22] are. You know what we're preaching for?
[51:24] What I'm preaching for is that a whole
[51:26] body of people moves higher, moves to
[51:29] another level. I heard brother John Andy
[51:31] say that quite some time ago, maybe two,
[51:34] three years ago, and it never left me.
[51:36] That's what we're here for, to move
[51:38] people to a higher level, to another
[51:40] plane, not to settle back down higher
[51:43] and higher.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what this whole message is
[51:46] all about.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; And you can find it in Apostle Paul. You
[51:52] just can't find these people as normal
[51:55] individuals with a normal job and a
[51:58] normal calling. These people had a
[52:00] cause.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; And perhaps it wasn't all flamboyant.
[52:05] No, some of them have a quiet burning
[52:08] flame. But they were always the same.
[52:11] And they were constant. Wherever they
[52:13] were, they were had an effect upon the
[52:16] community or upon their area,
[52:18] &gt;&gt; upon the people that were around them.
[52:21] Apostle Paul said in the book of Acts,
[52:24] he said, "None of these things move me."
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Listen to me tonight. There are things
[52:31] that are out here that are trying to
[52:33] move you.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; There are things I'm going to come on it
[52:38] a little bit further down in the
[52:39] message. There's things out there, and
[52:42] brother Brandham says, "Why do you
[52:45] hunger, church?"
[52:47] &gt;&gt; I'll give the quote later on. Why do you
[52:49] hunger, church? Are you church?
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Why do you hunger?
[52:54] &gt;&gt; And why do you thirst?
[52:56] Because it's God's wanting to reveal
[53:00] these secrets to you.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; But he says, "But you let
[53:04] &gt;&gt; you let this the world get it out of
[53:07] you."
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Didn't say sin, but just the world. You
[53:13] let your job get it out of you. you let
[53:15] your wife or your husband or your family
[53:18] or somebody get it out of you. See, I'll
[53:22] just leave that there because I want to
[53:24] come back to it. But Paul went on to
[53:26] say, "None of these things move me,
[53:27] neither count I my life dear unto myself
[53:31] so that I might finish my course with
[53:34] joy and the ministry which I have
[53:36] received of the Lord Jesus to testify
[53:39] the gospel of the grace of God." And in
[53:43] Corinthians, he went on to say in
[53:44] Corinthians, for though I preach the
[53:46] gospel, I have nothing to glory of, for
[53:49] a necessity is laid upon me. Yay, woe
[53:53] unto me if I preach not the gospel. This
[53:56] a man is a driven man.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; It's not just some history. This are
[54:00] this is our brother
[54:02] &gt;&gt; serving the same God we're serving. He's
[54:05] the first church age messenger. And
[54:07] thank God he had others coming in behind
[54:09] him burning with the same flame and the
[54:12] same fire.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he went on to say, "For if I
[54:16] do this willingly, I have a reward. But
[54:19] if I against my will, a dispensation of
[54:22] the gospel is committed unto me." He
[54:24] said, "What is my reward then? Verily,
[54:26] that when I preach the gospel, I may
[54:28] make the gospel of Christ without
[54:30] charge, that I abuse not my power in the
[54:33] gospel. For though I be free from all
[54:35] men, yet have I made myself, yet have I
[54:39] made myself servant unto all.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; You know, this preaching the gospel of
[54:46] Jesus Christ
[54:47] is not just something. It's not
[54:49] something that maybe sitting out in the
[54:51] audience people think, oh, you're on a
[54:54] platform or you're behind the pulpit and
[54:55] it's it's all it's all, you know, you're
[54:57] before the people. I tell you what, it's
[54:59] a service.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; You have to be willing to serve. Amen.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Not here to talk about myself, but most
[55:06] of the days that I was away, I would
[55:08] maybe have breakfast
[55:10] and maybe some cheese and crackers after
[55:13] the evening service back in my room. And
[55:17] Sunday, they had a picnic and everybody
[55:19] was there and everybody's invited and
[55:21] said, "You never saw so much food." And
[55:23] oh, I would have liked to have been
[55:24] there not for the food, but to just to
[55:26] be with the brothers and sisters and get
[55:28] to shake their hand. I never even got to
[55:30] shake most of their hand because I just
[55:32] went from the service directly home.
[55:35] Went to my room already thinking about
[55:37] the next service. But Sunday morning, I
[55:40] just stayed from morning right till the
[55:43] evening service time. And God gave us a
[55:46] gracious time. Friends, we're here to
[55:48] serve. I don't say the ministry. We are
[55:51] here as a church, as a body of Christ.
[55:54] We're here to serve. We've got a call on
[55:56] our lives. We've got a commission and we
[56:00] are those that have been sent here.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; We didn't we weren't birthed here by
[56:04] accident. We have been sent here.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; And that whatever skills you have, God
[56:09] gave it to you. Whatever talent you
[56:11] have, God gave it to you. The person you
[56:13] are, God brought you here.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And surrender and yield up
[56:18] what you have, who you are to him. And
[56:20] he will use it.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He wants that fire kindled.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; And so, Apostle Paul goes on. He says,
[56:32] "And unto the Jews, I became a Jew
[56:36] that I might gain the Jews for them that
[56:39] are under the law." And he says, "To
[56:40] them that are without the law, as
[56:42] without the law,
[56:44] that I might gain some, gain them. And
[56:47] to the weak, I became as weak that I
[56:50] might gain the weak. I made all things
[56:53] to all men that I might by all means
[56:57] save some. You know, friends, we're not
[57:00] here to live our own lives. We're not
[57:02] here just to be individuals and a little
[57:05] in a little orbit of our own. We're here
[57:08] if they're weak, we became weak, and to
[57:10] those that are those that are Jews or
[57:12] those that are this, we became that.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:18] Know ye not that they which run in a
[57:20] race run all, but one receiveth the
[57:22] prize, so run that ye may obtain.
[57:28] Others in the scripture have had a real
[57:29] purpose in life. And the Bible
[57:34] is a record
[57:36] of zealous people,
[57:39] &gt;&gt; zealots,
[57:42] &gt;&gt; zealous people
[57:44] &gt;&gt; that were gripped with zeal.
[57:47] Brother Brandham said in the
[57:48] manifestation of the spirit, he said, "I
[57:51] may not have much knowledge of the word
[57:53] and so forth, but in my heart I have a
[57:56] love for him that I can't express.
[57:59] He's more than life to me.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Just a short statement, but he wasn't
[58:04] just saying something flowery. He was
[58:07] saying absolute truth. I may not be able
[58:10] to express it, but down in my heart is a
[58:12] love so great. He said, I cannot express
[58:16] it and it means more than life.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; I'm going to come down to our address.
[58:26] more than our job,
[58:28] &gt;&gt; more than our education,
[58:30] &gt;&gt; more than our own little way of life,
[58:33] &gt;&gt; more than uh you know, more than maybe
[58:36] uh what what we possibly could do. I can
[58:40] do it. I I know I can get there. I can
[58:42] achieve this. I maybe that's not the
[58:44] goal that God wants you to achieve.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; May have something else in mind for you.
[58:50] Let him do the molding.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist, when we read of him,
[58:59] he preached with such force as the Holy
[59:02] Spirit poured through him the
[59:04] fulfillment of Malachi 3. He preached it
[59:07] with such force and it caught the
[59:09] attention of the people. I'm mentioning
[59:12] quite a number so that you can just
[59:15] identify with them. And then it said of
[59:17] him, "Behold, I send my messenger, and
[59:19] he shall prepare the way before me, and
[59:21] the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly
[59:23] come to his temple, even the messenger
[59:25] of the covenant whom you delight in.
[59:27] Behold, he shall come," sayth the Lord.
[59:30] Amen.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; And who may abide his day? Who may be
[59:34] the who may abide the day of his coming?
[59:37] And who shall stand when he appearth?
[59:39] For he is like a refiner's fire and a
[59:42] fuller soap, speaking of Jesus Christ.
[59:45] He shall sit as a refiner and purifier
[59:47] of silver. And he shall purify the sons
[59:50] of Levi and purge them as gold and
[59:53] silver that they may offer unto the Lord
[59:55] an offering of righteousness. And I
[59:57] would suggest tonight that possibly and
[1:00:00] most likely that there is an area in
[1:00:02] every one of our lives that this refiner
[1:00:05] of fire that there's some dross that
[1:00:08] there's something there that he could
[1:00:11] burn and we could walk out of this place
[1:00:13] a pure people for God. I'm not talking
[1:00:16] about sinful things. I'm not talking
[1:00:17] about iniquity or disobedience. I'm
[1:00:20] talking about simply having the dross
[1:00:23] burned up.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; God is doing things even when we don't
[1:00:33] realize it.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's word is going forth.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; We may not even realize it
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; during a service. He's a refiner of
[1:00:45] fire. And it speaks of John the Baptist
[1:00:49] then in Luke's gospel. And he shall go
[1:00:51] before him in the spirit and power of
[1:00:54] Elias. And he'll shall turn the hearts
[1:00:57] of the fathers to the children and the
[1:00:59] disobedient
[1:01:01] uh to the to the wisdom of the just to
[1:01:03] make ready a people prepared for the
[1:01:06] Lord.
[1:01:08] And he said, "I indeed baptize you with
[1:01:11] water under repentance, but he that
[1:01:13] cometh after me, he's mightier than I,
[1:01:16] whose shoes I'm not worthy to bear, and
[1:01:18] he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:01:21] and with fire.
[1:01:25] this zeal.
[1:01:27] Not just zeal. I'm going to shift a wee
[1:01:30] bit. Going to shift gears.
[1:01:33] Not just zeal, but the zeal of thine
[1:01:37] house.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Not the zeal for my job has eaten me up.
[1:01:43] Not the zeal for this sport. Not the
[1:01:44] zeal for this goal that I have. Not the
[1:01:47] zeal for something else in life.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; But the zeal of thine house.
[1:01:54] hath eaten me up.
[1:02:06] You as a body of people
[1:02:10] are the house
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; and you as an individual
[1:02:16] is also the house.
[1:02:21] And Satan will use and is using and
[1:02:24] contriving every possible thing he can
[1:02:28] to do damage to the house
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; and to fill it with all kinds of stuff.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; And the one I'm representing is here
[1:02:41] tonight to get it out
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; of the house.
[1:02:48] That is why when the prophet came, he
[1:02:51] came and his message was a delivering
[1:02:54] message.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; But it was a delivering message because
[1:02:58] it was liberating us and it cast things
[1:03:00] out of this house.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; How many of you here can rejoice over
[1:03:05] that?
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; This message is a liberating message, a
[1:03:13] delivering message. And sometimes it
[1:03:16] comes as one of our brothers of brother
[1:03:19] uh Richard Drake's dad. He said, "It
[1:03:21] tore strips off me, but it sure felt
[1:03:24] good."
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; It was a a purifying purging. Sometimes
[1:03:31] we get things, you know, little things
[1:03:32] that we hold it kind of dear to
[1:03:34] ourselves and it's not it's not being a
[1:03:37] benefit maybe even to others or to your
[1:03:39] own self and God has to get shed of it
[1:03:42] and get rid of it.
[1:03:46] The intense desire was for the house or
[1:03:50] the dwelling place of God. And it's very
[1:03:52] much a part of the character of Jesus
[1:03:55] Christ. The Apostle Paul writing to the
[1:03:58] Corinthians said, "I'm jealous over
[1:04:00] you." Same word, zealous. I'm jealous
[1:04:04] over you, but it's with a godly
[1:04:06] jealousy.
[1:04:08] I'm going to say tonight publicly to you
[1:04:11] that know me so well, I'm jealous over
[1:04:14] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; When I see things that creep in, whether
[1:04:19] it be in a family or an individual life,
[1:04:22] I say I'm on a war path.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to do war with this spirit.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Not going to have something bind people
[1:04:36] and hold them back.
[1:04:38] This is a liberating message.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is a message of uh uh
[1:04:44] this we are baptized with this message.
[1:04:46] It's a message of fire.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Not just excitement, not just something
[1:04:50] for a moment. It's not just for this
[1:04:52] Wednesday evening.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; This whole message is it sets the course
[1:04:55] of our life.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; We're going to go through this world. We
[1:05:01] are going through this world like a uh
[1:05:04] like a comet through the sky and leave a
[1:05:07] trail of fire behind us.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; The son of man, I say Jesus Christ
[1:05:15] said to those spirits, listen
[1:05:20] what the scripture said here.
[1:05:24] And when he'd made a scourge of small
[1:05:26] cords,
[1:05:28] he drove them all out of the temple
[1:05:31] and the sheep and the oxen and poured
[1:05:34] out the changers money and overthrew the
[1:05:38] tables. And he said to them that sold
[1:05:40] doves, "Take these things hence."
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Make not my father's house a house of
[1:05:49] merchandise.
[1:05:50] People might think, "Oh, people talk
[1:05:52] about selling things in the church."
[1:05:54] It's way beyond that.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us when it speaks of the
[1:06:02] oh my
[1:06:06] speaks there's of another cleansing and
[1:06:09] I haven't got time to go into it, but
[1:06:11] there's a cleansing. And brother
[1:06:13] Brandham speaks of the cleansing of this
[1:06:15] this earth.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He's going to burn it with a
[1:06:21] fire
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; to make it a fit dwelling place
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; for Jesus Christ and his bride.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; And part of that cleansing, I haven't
[1:06:29] got time, but when you go home, you can
[1:06:31] read it tonight or tomorrow in chapter
[1:06:33] 18 of of Revelation. And it talks about
[1:06:36] this Babylon and the kings of the earth
[1:06:39] and who committed fornication and lived
[1:06:42] deliciously with her. And they shall
[1:06:44] bewail her and lament her. For when they
[1:06:47] shall see the smoke of her burning,
[1:06:50] standing a far off for the fear of her
[1:06:52] torment, saying, "Alas, alas, that great
[1:06:54] city Babylon, the mighty city, for in
[1:06:57] one hour is thy judgment is thy judgment
[1:07:00] come." And listen to this. And the
[1:07:02] merchandise of gold, and of silver, and
[1:07:05] of precious stones, and of pearls, and
[1:07:07] of fine linen, and purple, and silk, and
[1:07:11] scarlet, and all the thine wood, and all
[1:07:14] manner of vessels of ivory, and all
[1:07:16] manner of vessels of most precious wood,
[1:07:20] and of brass, and of iron, and of
[1:07:22] marble, and of cinnamon, and odors, and
[1:07:24] ointments, and frankincense, and wine.
[1:07:26] Think of this. This is what he's he he's
[1:07:28] purging it out. Amen.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; These things these things were objects
[1:07:33] of of such a they were so glamorized the
[1:07:36] people blinded the people and oh they
[1:07:39] were so taken up with all of these fancy
[1:07:42] and wonderful things and meant nothing
[1:07:44] to God.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; And he drove it out of the earth, the
[1:07:49] whole earth to make it a place that was
[1:07:51] fit for the believers.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:55] and and find flour and wheat and beasts
[1:07:57] and sheep and horses and chariots and
[1:08:00] listen to the last line. And slaves
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; and the souls of men.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; I don't care who you are, but one day
[1:08:10] you were held by that.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; We all were held
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; under the power of this system
[1:08:19] and God came and drove it out.
[1:08:24] He made a holy scourge and came with a
[1:08:28] prophet's voice in our day
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; that was s that was successful that was
[1:08:36] essential that was sufficient is the
[1:08:39] word I'm looking for sufficient to loose
[1:08:42] us and the oxen and the doves and the
[1:08:45] changers of money and all the things in
[1:08:47] other words all the things that occupied
[1:08:50] that temple
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; said take it out cuz that's not what
[1:08:54] this temple's made for.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; And we're not going to develop a develop
[1:09:00] a a a system within a message that, you
[1:09:03] know, just become something that's
[1:09:05] acceptable. This is just a level that we
[1:09:07] are. We're not at any particular level.
[1:09:09] We're here at the at the uh at the
[1:09:13] bidding of the Holy Spirit. Whatever he
[1:09:15] says, we will do.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; What he wants of us, we will give. Amen.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Of our time, of our being, of our
[1:09:26] families, of whatever more.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; I want the service tonight and I thought
[1:09:34] about it earlier. This is my eighth
[1:09:37] service since I've been gone as a number
[1:09:40] eight. But I feel more I feel more
[1:09:42] committed because I'm here home with our
[1:09:45] own people. But I thought of this
[1:09:46] service and I thought I want God grant
[1:09:50] by the Holy Spirit that you will take
[1:09:53] and into the hearts of the people you'll
[1:09:56] rearrange our agendas. You'll rearrange
[1:10:00] our priorities. And may I may I be
[1:10:03] rewarded when this service is over that
[1:10:05] the message itself will have a different
[1:10:07] a different location in your agenda.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. I asked the people when they were
[1:10:14] away, how many people perhaps had read
[1:10:17] or heard or read the seals or people
[1:10:19] hadn't even read the seals? Might be
[1:10:21] some sitting here. You need how can you
[1:10:24] have the fire of God
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; when the very voice of God that he sent?
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he exposed in the seals
[1:10:32] this Babylon,
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; he exposed them
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; to their destruction. Satan hates this
[1:10:40] book of Revelation, which I do. He hates
[1:10:42] it. And you're sitting here. You love
[1:10:44] it.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; This is to be your focus.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; This is your focus, friends. My
[1:10:51] brothers, my sisters, this is our focus.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; This is our daily food.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; This is something we give ourselves to.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; This isn't a sideline. This isn't just
[1:11:04] an optional thing to my life. This is to
[1:11:06] be the focus of your life.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:10] Don't don't sit there and just say,
[1:11:11] "Well, that's the way you see it,
[1:11:12] Brother Ed. That's the way the Bible
[1:11:14] teaches it. That's the way the message.
[1:11:16] You can't find anything else in the
[1:11:18] message." Then it should be number one.
[1:11:20] Is the message Christ?
[1:11:22] [Applause]
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; What place is Christ to have?
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; He's to be number one.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; He'll never be number two. He's number
[1:11:30] one.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; We must allow that. We must say tonight,
[1:11:34] that's truth. I accept it. Even though
[1:11:38] you may not know how things are going to
[1:11:40] be arranged, just say, "God, take
[1:11:41] control of my life. Take order of my
[1:11:44] affairs."
[1:11:46] Hallelujah.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; It's not what I want. It's what he
[1:11:51] wants. Thy will be done on earth as it
[1:11:53] is in heaven.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Faithfulness. Was he faithful? Is he
[1:11:58] faithful? He expects us to be faithful.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; He came and delivered you for a purpose.
[1:12:04] He cast all those things out. Satan
[1:12:07] would make a merchandise of your life.
[1:12:09] He is today. He's making merchandise of
[1:12:12] the souls of men.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Just for a few minutes now,
[1:12:27] I want to speak about the burden of the
[1:12:29] word of the Lord
[1:12:31] in this generation.
[1:12:34] And this will take a quite a shift
[1:12:35] perhaps for you.
[1:12:38] It'll come in a way that maybe you
[1:12:40] didn't expect.
[1:12:42] But one of the things that jealousy
[1:12:44] does, it's protective.
[1:12:50] A husband for wife and a wife for
[1:12:52] husband.
[1:12:54] parents over their children
[1:12:58] or brother
[1:13:00] to sister just as members of a
[1:13:03] congregation in the church.
[1:13:07] We're not to see some fall and say, "Ah,
[1:13:09] look at that.
[1:13:11] Expect that. Look at they think they're
[1:13:13] a believer. Look at that." You you're
[1:13:15] not helping them.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; That's not lifting them up.
[1:13:22] Oh, I hear this or I hear that and I'm
[1:13:23] not speaking about anything specific
[1:13:24] because I haven't heard about anything.
[1:13:26] I'm speaking what's on my heart by the
[1:13:28] Holy Spirit.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; If you say, "Well, brother Ed, it's kind
[1:13:34] of on my case." I don't know anything
[1:13:35] about your case. I only know what the
[1:13:37] Holy Spirit is telling me to say.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; We are called on
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; We are called on to benefit the house
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; of Quad.
[1:13:50] If we say we must speak with our Lord
[1:13:53] Jesus Christ, make not my father's house
[1:13:56] a house of merchandise, I won't allow
[1:13:58] it.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Where have I got power? I may not be
[1:14:03] able to speak, but I got power in
[1:14:05] prayer.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; I got power with my uh uh relationship.
[1:14:10] I got power. I can visit. I can speak. I
[1:14:13] can do something.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; That's why I just told you the little
[1:14:18] account. It's not just a part of life.
[1:14:21] Years ago, speak to a young man, never
[1:14:24] see him for maybe five, six, seven,
[1:14:25] eight years. And next time you see him
[1:14:28] sitting right on front
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; with his wife
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; serving God.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; It so helped me.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; It just so helped me.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; We're not there to destroy people. We're
[1:14:43] there to encourage them. Say you can do
[1:14:45] it. I say to you young people, you can
[1:14:48] do it, but you do what? You can be in
[1:14:50] the rapture.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; It's for you.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; It's not for people to say, "Oh, um, you
[1:14:56] know, uh, come breath, go breath."
[1:14:58] That'll never get you there. You think
[1:15:01] they're going to You think that God's
[1:15:02] going to have people stand on a stand on
[1:15:04] a athletes uh podium at some world
[1:15:08] Olympics and then uh and have Apostle
[1:15:11] Paul say
[1:15:14] every all people run but one wins the
[1:15:17] race. Right?
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; He knew what the Olympics was.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; And now we had one and the Bible speaks
[1:15:27] Malachi 1 and1 says the burden of the
[1:15:31] word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi
[1:15:34] twice in Zachchariah says the same
[1:15:36] thing. The burden of the word of the
[1:15:38] Lord. Do you know it might help you to
[1:15:40] understand when a minister comes and
[1:15:42] stands behind the pulpit here and you
[1:15:44] see it like it's a groaning. It's a it's
[1:15:48] an urging that's beyond their physical
[1:15:51] self to express. It's not it's not their
[1:15:54] excitement. It's not that they want to,
[1:15:57] you know, raise their voice or or or
[1:16:00] thunder out, but it is a groaning
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; from within. It's a it's a great thrust
[1:16:07] that's coming from deep inside because
[1:16:10] it's the burden of the word of the Lord.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; It's not the burden of the man. It's a
[1:16:15] burden of the word of the Lord. And you
[1:16:17] need to be spiritual. Sometimes when a
[1:16:19] minister stand behind the pullpit,
[1:16:21] remember it's a spiritual ministry. It's
[1:16:24] a spiritual battle.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; And Satan, look at how brother Brandham
[1:16:29] has to say to the people every once in a
[1:16:30] while. He says to them, he says, you
[1:16:33] know, I'm not just preaching to you here
[1:16:35] because they're coming so cutting
[1:16:37] sometimes so hard, but they know that
[1:16:39] it's going says these tapes, he said, go
[1:16:41] worldwide.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; He was ministering not just to the
[1:16:46] people there, but he's ministering to
[1:16:47] more that was beyond that. And I am too
[1:16:50] through you.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; This word lives on. Amen.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; And so this is very essence of the
[1:17:01] entire message that we have the message
[1:17:04] of this hour the end the very essence of
[1:17:06] it is one of I'm taking now beyond zeal
[1:17:12] to travail.
[1:17:14] I spoke here some time ago, touched on
[1:17:16] it, the breath of God
[1:17:19] and how the the the the depth of that
[1:17:24] the breath of God. The last explanation
[1:17:28] to that phrase is as a woman in travail
[1:17:32] panting
[1:17:33] in travail
[1:17:35] panting. And it came to me with such
[1:17:39] force while I was away
[1:17:42] begin to see.
[1:17:44] I said to the people,
[1:17:47] you know,
[1:17:50] in North Carolina,
[1:17:54] we're just no distance at all from
[1:17:57] Spindale.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Where's Spindale? Who's ever heard of
[1:18:01] Spindale? called that because it was a
[1:18:04] cotton place where they spun yarns.
[1:18:07] Spindale here. The prophet God in his
[1:18:12] extraordinary measure of grace sends
[1:18:15] that kind of a voice and ministry to
[1:18:17] Spindale.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; I said to the people here, I'm going to
[1:18:21] read you what he said in Spindale. Here
[1:18:22] it is.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Here's who he called out. Here's the
[1:18:26] names he called. Where are these people?
[1:18:29] Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Where are all those thousands that were
[1:18:33] there?
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Anybody here that was there? And and and
[1:18:36] I called out maybe one or two. They're
[1:18:39] not there.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; You'd think, "Oh, what a loss. What a
[1:18:45] what an exercise in in vain to send a
[1:18:48] mighty voice to spin nail. It's it's not
[1:18:52] over.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; I was still able to be there to echo it
[1:18:56] out.
[1:18:57] And God has a voice there in that whole
[1:19:00] area.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; A mighty voice.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; I didn't know that brother Kim was going
[1:19:06] to come down. Brother Kim went and maybe
[1:19:09] doesn't want me to say this. Brother Ben
[1:19:10] is here. And he also uh went with his
[1:19:12] mom and they they met their dad down
[1:19:15] there. And and brother Kim, he went and
[1:19:16] he he had had a plan and he bought a
[1:19:20] car, but he had he had the printer. He
[1:19:23] took the printer with him and the and
[1:19:25] the stapler and the cutter and
[1:19:27] everything else and and brother Joseph
[1:19:30] Green who is now the pastor there. There
[1:19:32] was about a thousand people that night I
[1:19:34] would think and and he said I want on
[1:19:36] the last night I want him to put that on
[1:19:38] the platform and so brother Kim just
[1:19:40] stood there and pulled it down on the
[1:19:43] internet. It was actually internet. It
[1:19:44] wasn't wasn't you know it wasn't just on
[1:19:47] a disc. Pulled it down in the internet
[1:19:48] and and and said okay we'll go here.
[1:19:51] We'll we'll go to Spindale. We'll just
[1:19:54] go on a we we'll just go on a search and
[1:19:57] we'll search Spindale. Okay, there's
[1:19:58] there's the messages he preached in
[1:20:00] Spindale. So, we'll just choose this one
[1:20:02] right here. And click. And here here's
[1:20:05] another one. Click. And by the time he
[1:20:07] was done speaking, both of them were
[1:20:09] off. And another brother came up and
[1:20:11] just stapled them both and trimmed them
[1:20:13] both and and within about two and a half
[1:20:14] minutes had both of the messages out.
[1:20:16] And I just said, "Who wants these
[1:20:18] messages?" Brother Joe Green. Just went
[1:20:19] like that, you know. So I turned around,
[1:20:21] presented them to him. He said, "These
[1:20:23] are messages that nobody's ever read."
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; I won't say nobody's ever read. Perhaps
[1:20:28] somebody has read it on the on their on
[1:20:30] the on the internet, but you know what I
[1:20:32] mean.
[1:20:33] The people were gripped by that.
[1:20:37] But you see one of the things and I'm
[1:20:39] now going to tell you and you can think
[1:20:42] what you wish of me.
[1:20:45] But one thing that I see creeping in
[1:20:47] amongst the message
[1:20:51] is actually a a Catholic spirit. Oh, you
[1:20:55] say you're not serious,
[1:20:58] brother Ed. What are you saying? Yeah.
[1:21:00] Yeah. You know what the Catholic spirit
[1:21:02] is?
[1:21:04] The priest will tell me.
[1:21:06] The priest reads the book.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; The priest does it. I don't have to do
[1:21:11] it.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; I just go to church and the priest tells
[1:21:14] me
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; whatever he tells me. How many Catholics
[1:21:17] are here saved
[1:21:21] all across the congregation? Staunch
[1:21:24] Catholics.
[1:21:25] My father was an alter boy. Brother
[1:21:27] Lance Laroo was an alter boy.
[1:21:30] My father stood behind the pullpit, the
[1:21:33] little podium, and would look at the
[1:21:35] Bible, and he's not a kid. He's a young
[1:21:38] man, and his soul yearned to see what
[1:21:43] was in that book. If I could just put my
[1:21:46] hands on it and read that book, but it's
[1:21:49] not for me. It's just for the priest.
[1:21:55] And the danger within the message is
[1:21:59] that they're just content
[1:22:01] with what they got.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; And Satan's trying to pull one over on
[1:22:10] you.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; And some of you young people, the
[1:22:14] messages are lined up in your mother and
[1:22:16] dad's
[1:22:20] shelves.
[1:22:21] you haven't you can read good and you go
[1:22:23] and you study hard and you write exams
[1:22:25] and all the rest of it and to get good
[1:22:28] marks great get good marks what's that
[1:22:31] going to do for you
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; might give you better place in life but
[1:22:34] it's not going to do anything for you
[1:22:35] eternity
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; unless the good marks and what you do
[1:22:38] here is devoted to Christ devoted to God
[1:22:41] I'm going to learn this I'm going to I'm
[1:22:43] going to uh seek to give myself I've got
[1:22:46] certain skills certain things and for
[1:22:48] the kingdom of God but I lay it all
[1:22:50] before the kingdom of God all for the
[1:22:52] body of Christ.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Am I speaking in tongues or foreign
[1:22:57] language or something? You understand
[1:22:58] what I mean?
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; I told part of your testimony, Sister
[1:23:01] Lewan, and I told how sister Marjorie
[1:23:04] Miles heard the prophet's voice. It
[1:23:07] wasn't CK&W or it wasn't some other
[1:23:10] radio station. It wasn't Soft Rock and
[1:23:12] it wasn't 102 Christian station. She
[1:23:15] heard a voice
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; and she wondered, "Where in the world is
[1:23:19] that voice coming from?" and dial the
[1:23:22] television channels to try and find to
[1:23:24] get it to match and tried the radio
[1:23:26] station to try to get it to match and
[1:23:28] now I don't know all the details but the
[1:23:30] end of that is sister Lana's here and
[1:23:32] sister Marjory's here two souls
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; I say glory to God
[1:23:39] hallelujah
[1:23:41] let's give him praise
[1:23:44] hallelujah he's worth it
[1:23:49] I told her testimony, brother Darren, of
[1:23:52] God's mighty power
[1:23:55] to take the scourge and drive out every
[1:24:00] binding force. Oh, I just want to give
[1:24:02] glory to him tonight.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Tell your friends, you're not going to
[1:24:07] stop me. I'm going to have a jubilee
[1:24:08] here this evening.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; I want you to continue with it.
[1:24:14] Change your whole focus, your whole
[1:24:16] attention from the youngest who can
[1:24:18] understand me to the eldest here. Change
[1:24:20] our priorities.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Start your day. Have the word of God.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Make it a diet.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; A diet.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; If you don't get the message, don't have
[1:24:31] breakfast.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; If you don't have the message, don't eat
[1:24:34] that day.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; And you'll find yourself in the message
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; being dictated to by the flesh. Say, "Oh
[1:24:41] God, create in me a great hunger.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[1:24:48] after righteousness.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; The zeal of thine house. The zeal of
[1:24:54] thine house. The zeal. God put a zeal in
[1:24:57] you for this house.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; I need this word.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; I need this.
[1:25:05] I need it today.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; I need this instruction today. Amen.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; See, if we don't take that, I can tell
[1:25:14] you that Satan has
[1:25:18] uh he's a cunning cunning enemy. And
[1:25:21] this is a whole another service and I
[1:25:23] can't even begin on it now, but I'm
[1:25:24] going to introduce it.
[1:25:27] Hollywood.
[1:25:30] When you think of Hollywood, you think
[1:25:31] of movies and actors. And just forget
[1:25:33] that for a moment. Hollywood is a
[1:25:35] spirit.
[1:25:38] Hollywood is a spirit that has permeated
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; your home,
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; this church,
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; your school,
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; your own individual life.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, whether you want me to
[1:25:52] say it or not, you can't prevent it by
[1:25:55] yourself.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; It fashions the way you think.
[1:26:02] Hollywood has made mockery of what they
[1:26:06] call love.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Hollywood has made a mockery and a joke
[1:26:12] out of marriage.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Hollywood has permeated every area.
[1:26:21] Hollywood has permeated the pulpit
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; and religion
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; and worship
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; until they don't know what worship. The
[1:26:30] thing of worship is a hype up the people
[1:26:32] and put on a production. That's not
[1:26:35] that's not worship. Worship is when you
[1:26:37] get lost in God and you're just saying,
[1:26:39] "Oh, glory to God." Something's rising
[1:26:42] within you and you can't keep it down.
[1:26:45] That's worship.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Hollywood's made a mockery of prayer.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; People don't know how to pray.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Even last service I was in
[1:27:00] And I'm not making any reference to
[1:27:02] brother Ron Spencer church, but people
[1:27:05] today I said you can't keep it out
[1:27:06] anywhere. Let's pray. Raise your voice
[1:27:10] to God. Begin to pray.
[1:27:13] Hear pin drop.
[1:27:16] 300 people praying.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; 500 people praying. Well,
[1:27:24] I can't. I'm afraid somebody might
[1:27:25] listen to me. I'm afraid that a
[1:27:27] nonsense. You're not afraid somebody
[1:27:28] might listen to you. You get on the
[1:27:30] phone, you're gonna yap somebody's ear
[1:27:32] off.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; It's just where your priority is.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; The problem is you haven't talked to
[1:27:40] him.
[1:27:42] Come on, rise up.
[1:27:45] [Applause]
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; It's the same son of man
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; that's here tonight that's trying to
[1:27:53] drive out the stuff that's been making a
[1:27:54] merchandise of your life, trying to hold
[1:27:57] you back, trying to hinder you, trying
[1:27:59] to bind up your family, bind up your own
[1:28:02] life. God is here.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is here this evening. The
[1:28:07] same son of man that was here on earth
[1:28:09] in that temple is here now in this
[1:28:12] temple.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; The same son of man.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The same one and the same
[1:28:19] voice is going to purge the whole earth
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; and make it ready.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; They've tried to take the souls of man
[1:28:27] and make them slaves.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Make merchandise of the souls of men. I
[1:28:32] tell you what I announce to Satan today.
[1:28:34] He's not going to have this soul. Not
[1:28:36] going to have your soul. You agree with
[1:28:38] me. You agree with God's word. Not going
[1:28:41] to have my soul. I give all that I am
[1:28:43] and all I ever can be to him.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Son of man is here.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Same son of man.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Only he's in another temple. And that's
[1:28:57] a more important temple. It's the temple
[1:28:59] of God.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:05] Praise God.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; That word came by burden and I'm going
[1:29:11] to close with this.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham came into a
[1:29:15] institution.
[1:29:17] It was an insane institution. Said it
[1:29:20] was psychopathic institution.
[1:29:23] He came there and all insane people.
[1:29:29] And there was a very lovely young lady
[1:29:32] in her 20s sitting there
[1:29:36] and brother Bham is looking around.
[1:29:40] The young woman spoke up and says sir,
[1:29:43] would you start with me?
[1:29:46] He said you
[1:29:50] are you what are you doing this place?
[1:29:54] They said I'm insane.
[1:30:02] It was in Flint, Michigan.
[1:30:06] And he went into the room and there was
[1:30:08] a man with him. Beautiful young woman.
[1:30:10] Looked about 22 to 25 years old. 20 to
[1:30:13] 25 years old.
[1:30:16] She said, "How do you do?"
[1:30:20] Said, "If you don't mind, sir, I'd like
[1:30:21] you to start with me."
[1:30:25] Now, as I'm going through this,
[1:30:29] will you please bear in mind this is not
[1:30:33] just a man from Jeffersonville, Indiana
[1:30:35] that wandered into
[1:30:37] an insane psychopathic institution.
[1:30:41] This is God Almighty,
[1:30:44] veiled in flesh of a prophet messenger
[1:30:47] walking into a place that is invaded by
[1:30:50] every spirit.
[1:30:52] And there was almighty God
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; ready to speak a word.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; And it's only to elect.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; We don't know who it is. Oh, if you only
[1:31:05] know how privileged you are that he came
[1:31:09] your way.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Thousands, millions may be better,
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; but he came your way.
[1:31:21] Hallelujah.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; She said, "If you don't mind, sir, could
[1:31:31] you start with me?" She said, "I
[1:31:32] wonder."
[1:31:34] And said, "Could you listen to my story
[1:31:36] just a moment?" She said, "I was reared
[1:31:38] in a good home."
[1:31:42] And my mother taught me not to do wrong,
[1:31:45] to shun the evil, and embrace the right
[1:31:48] thing.
[1:31:50] I got mixed up with a young man.
[1:31:54] It caused me disgrace.
[1:31:57] I just started to throw myself away and
[1:32:00] I became an alcoholic.
[1:32:03] Then they picked me up and sent me to a
[1:32:05] Catholic institution
[1:32:08] called the Good Shepherd's Home.
[1:32:12] There I was under correction for a
[1:32:14] number of years and then they released
[1:32:16] me and as soon as I got out
[1:32:19] I started drinking again.
[1:32:22] And she said, "Then I served a year or
[1:32:24] two in a woman's state prison."
[1:32:28] And said, "Then I changed from
[1:32:30] Protestant to Catholic." See, she's
[1:32:32] trying.
[1:32:35] Then during this time, I changed back to
[1:32:37] Protestant again from the chaplain
[1:32:39] talking to me. The chaplain persuaded
[1:32:42] her in the prison that she should be a
[1:32:44] Protestant again.
[1:32:47] and said, "I came out and tried again,
[1:32:49] but she said I went right back into it
[1:32:51] again into prostitution
[1:32:54] and drinking."
[1:32:57] And I said, "Brother Bren speaking, and
[1:32:59] your mother,
[1:33:01] she's dead.
[1:33:04] Father, he's dead."
[1:33:08] And I said, "What do you think they
[1:33:09] would think about you now?"
[1:33:12] She said, "Oh, if I could only go back
[1:33:15] again."
[1:33:18] And I said, "Now listen, friends.
[1:33:21] Brother Brandham isn't taking three
[1:33:23] pages
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; to bore you
[1:33:27] because this is nothing less than the
[1:33:30] Holy Spirit of God speaking to a whole
[1:33:32] generation."
[1:33:35] And I said, "A lovely young woman like
[1:33:37] you. Don't you desire to be married and
[1:33:40] have babies like all mothers do and so
[1:33:45] forth." And she said, "I would love to,
[1:33:47] sir, but look at me. What What could I
[1:33:49] offer anyone?" I said, "You've got one
[1:33:53] thing you could offer." And she said,
[1:33:55] "What's that?"
[1:33:57] I said, "Your soul to Jesus Christ."
[1:34:02] And she said, "Sir, he wouldn't receive
[1:34:04] me."
[1:34:06] And I said, "Oh, yes, he will."
[1:34:09] She said, "How do you know he would? I
[1:34:12] tried."
[1:34:13] And I said, "Yes, you're just turning
[1:34:16] the pages, but you really come to him."
[1:34:20] She said, "What could he do with me?" I
[1:34:24] said, "Make a lady out of you."
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; She said, "Not me. I'm too far gone
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; now. Listen to the breath of God
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; listen to the breath of God. Listen to
[1:34:38] the groaning now of the Holy Spirit to
[1:34:42] woman in this state.
[1:34:45] I said he can take you back
[1:34:49] from the time when you was a virgin
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; innocent girl. The blood of Jesus Christ
[1:34:56] is sufficient and powerful to transform
[1:34:59] the vilest sinner to a bloodwashed saint
[1:35:03] guilless before God.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; That wasn't just a statement to her.
[1:35:10] That was God's breath.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; That was God's breath. That was God's
[1:35:16] creative word
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; to create her back into her innocence,
[1:35:21] into her virginity again. Do you believe
[1:35:24] that or do you think that's over the
[1:35:26] edge? That's absolutely the truth.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; That was the power of Almighty God
[1:35:32] coming through a vessel to take her back
[1:35:34] to the state of her innocence again.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; And the people said,
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; we should say, "Praise be to God."
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; That's my God.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's my God.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; He loosed you.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; He set you free.
[1:35:52] He didn't just do that. He created you
[1:35:55] as a new creature in Christ Jesus and
[1:35:58] takes you back to your innocence again.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; That's the travail
[1:36:05] of the Holy Spirit. That's the travail
[1:36:08] of God.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; That's what the Apostle Paul was saying.
[1:36:12] I travail again in birth for you. That's
[1:36:16] why the prophet spoke birth pains. He
[1:36:19] said, "Israel
[1:36:21] entered into birth painans under every
[1:36:23] prophet's message."
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Listen friends,
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; this earth is going to be born
[1:36:33] into a perfect place fit for Christ and
[1:36:37] his bride and his wife.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon went on to say,
[1:36:45] she said, "I've tried so many times
[1:36:50] And he said, "Well,
[1:36:52] I want to tell you, I believe your case
[1:36:54] has never been diagnosed, right?"
[1:36:59] And I said, "You don't want to be like
[1:37:01] that." And she said, "Certainly not."
[1:37:03] See, God was in the desire.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; God was in her desire. That's why she
[1:37:08] tried. That's why she changed to
[1:37:09] Catholic. That's why she changed back to
[1:37:11] Protestant, because she was trying.
[1:37:16] It's not trying.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; And I know we've just come through camp
[1:37:20] and we've had young people say, "Well,
[1:37:22] I've tried." That's not it.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; It's not it. It's selling out.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; See, I can't get that across. Selling
[1:37:31] out.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Parents need to be sold out. Give an
[1:37:36] example to the young people
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; need to be sold out for God.
[1:37:42] Hallelujah.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful on a Wednesday night we
[1:37:46] have a crowd like this that's here and
[1:37:49] that is evidence that you have something
[1:37:51] in your soul towards the message. But
[1:37:54] don't come here just so as a a gathering
[1:37:56] place or this is my social circle. It's
[1:37:59] not a social circle.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; We're here because of the fire of God.
[1:38:05] And if you're not here because of the
[1:38:07] fire of God, go get entertainment
[1:38:09] somewhere else. We're not here to
[1:38:10] entertain. We're here to preach and take
[1:38:13] the gloves off and preach the word of
[1:38:15] God.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:18] [Applause]
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; This flowery just, you know, we're not
[1:38:31] here just to be flowery. We're here to
[1:38:32] preach the truth.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; And if there ever was a day that we
[1:38:36] needed, it's now.
[1:38:41] So he asked her to get down to pray.
[1:38:44] She said, "What you said a few moments
[1:38:46] ago is exactly what I want to be. I want
[1:38:48] to be a mother with a husband and
[1:38:50] babies, someone to love and someone that
[1:38:53] loves me." And she said, "I'd never
[1:38:55] spoil a man's life like I am." Says,
[1:38:58] "You don't have to." And he had her get
[1:39:01] down and pray. And she prayed for a
[1:39:04] while. And she looked up at him. He
[1:39:07] said, "It's over."
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "No, it's not.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; You're just going to get up and be
[1:39:12] exactly the same. You stay right there."
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; And she began to pray. And he began to
[1:39:18] pray. And they prayed and they prayed
[1:39:20] and they stayed there. And finally, he
[1:39:23] said, with the tears streaming down her
[1:39:24] face, she looked up at him. He said,
[1:39:26] "Said, brother Brandham, something's
[1:39:28] happened." He said, "That's it.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; That's it. It's over now.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to be able to stay there
[1:39:35] till something happens.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Stay there till the Holy Spirit baptizes
[1:39:41] you. I still believe in the baptism of
[1:39:43] the Holy Spirit.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. With the demonstration and power
[1:39:50] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; We believe in it, do we not?
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; God's cleansing his temple.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; He's cleansing his temple. Don't you
[1:40:03] dare stay where you have stayed.
[1:40:08] If you've been in a state of backsliden
[1:40:12] or playing with the message, don't you
[1:40:15] stay there. Don't you stay there. Satan
[1:40:18] is a vile, cruel taskmaster and nobody
[1:40:24] can handle him. Humanly, you can't
[1:40:26] handle him. Say amen if you agree with
[1:40:29] that.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; You know you we can't handle him. He's a
[1:40:32] slicker. He knows more about the
[1:40:34] scripture than you do.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; You can't debate. You can't argue with
[1:40:38] him. What's the solution? Simple. You
[1:40:41] give yourself to God.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; You pray.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Stay on your knees till
[1:40:49] something happens.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; This woman got up and he said she's
[1:40:55] married now.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Lovely Christian woman.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Got her children and her husband. Amen.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; What did it?
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Creative.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Power.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; The third pole of Brother Bram's
[1:41:09] ministry was create.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Create. God is creating his bride right
[1:41:15] tonight. He's creating it. There is no
[1:41:17] other word. That's the only word. That's
[1:41:19] the only word that's creative.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; And that's why I have I'm so gripped and
[1:41:24] so so not sold on it. I'm so committed
[1:41:28] to it. The only word that this world has
[1:41:31] that we have in this world rather is
[1:41:34] thus saith the Lord.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; And there doesn't happen to be another
[1:41:38] message. God doesn't send two that go
[1:41:40] contrary one from the other. We have
[1:41:42] thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; I should have brought my
[1:41:50] while I was just getting ready for
[1:41:51] service.
[1:41:53] I got an email from Sister Janet Maloney
[1:41:58] and she said Saturday night
[1:42:02] and the atmosphere just turned into
[1:42:04] electric in the tent
[1:42:08] and brother
[1:42:11] Ron Spencer was preaching
[1:42:14] and caught away as he was.
[1:42:18] I hope you don't mind Sister Janet.
[1:42:19] Sister Janet had been praying. She'd
[1:42:22] been under a crushing crushing burden
[1:42:26] for a nephew, I believe it is,
[1:42:32] whose name is Raymond.
[1:42:38] And if you could picture a hopeless
[1:42:41] person,
[1:42:42] that's this man.
[1:42:45] and she had to come to a most
[1:42:49] difficult, most crushing of a decision
[1:42:53] concerning this man. And she
[1:42:55] counseledled with me
[1:42:57] some months ago about him.
[1:43:00] He's like he's like the woman. He's he
[1:43:02] he's the male of this woman.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Sister Janet, I gave the testimony twice
[1:43:11] and she walked into the tent. She had a
[1:43:14] second thing on her heart, two things.
[1:43:17] And she walked into the tent and she
[1:43:19] prayed and had her head down said, "Cod,
[1:43:23] cause brother Spencer to speak to me
[1:43:27] directly."
[1:43:30] And she raised her eyes and Brother Ron
[1:43:33] was right there in the platform looking
[1:43:35] straight into her eyes and he says,
[1:43:38] "Raymond."
[1:43:39] And what was else he said?
[1:43:43] He said to your don't worry or he's
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; poor poor boy.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; The poor boy free something like that.
[1:43:50] The poor boy spoke directly to her.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; I said to brother Raymond I said to
[1:43:55] brother Spencer do you remember saying
[1:43:56] that? He said no I have don't remember
[1:43:58] it at all.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; That's one. I have a second one. I won't
[1:44:02] tell you about it just now.
[1:44:05] Both on that same night. We're all
[1:44:08] sitting there maybe oblivious to how
[1:44:11] real God is.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How how powerful he is and
[1:44:16] maybe reaching out maybe a thousand
[1:44:18] people there. But there's one woman that
[1:44:20] walked out of there and said, "Thank
[1:44:21] God.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; He she touched the hem of his garment."
[1:44:27] My brother, my sister, I say to you
[1:44:29] tonight, don't miss it.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Don't just sit here on Wednesday evening
[1:44:34] saying, "Well, we're just here." Don't
[1:44:35] miss that.
[1:44:38] Amen.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the reality of God.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; I don't want anything less. Why settle
[1:44:44] for less when the heavens are full of
[1:44:46] the real?
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; The zeal. And I pray that God will
[1:44:55] baptize you with a fire of zeal for the
[1:44:58] house of God, for the temple of God. Not
[1:45:03] a bunch of stones in Israel. This
[1:45:05] temple, this bride.
[1:45:08] Hallelujah. This bride of Jesus Christ
[1:45:11] is the temple of God.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Your body is the temple of the Holy
[1:45:21] Ghost. Amen.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; And Satan's working feverishly
[1:45:27] with merchandise
[1:45:29] to, you know, the tradeoff deal and the
[1:45:32] barter thing and and you know, with our
[1:45:36] I know we get nervous. We start talking
[1:45:38] about our time. I'm talking about not
[1:45:40] your time. I'm not talking about your
[1:45:42] money. I'm talking about you.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; You as an individual. We you as an
[1:45:48] individual, young or old, you give
[1:45:51] yourself say, "Well, I'm a farmer. I'm a
[1:45:53] I'm a carpenter. I'm a plumber. I'm a
[1:45:56] I'm I'm a a skilled technician." Fine.
[1:46:00] Carry on. But the whole thing is sold
[1:46:02] out and given over to God. Whatever you
[1:46:04] want me, I'm eager.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stay with it, friends.
[1:46:11] I'm over time, but I'm going to stay
[1:46:12] with it because God wants this message
[1:46:15] down in your heart tonight.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; He wants this congregation, he's calling
[1:46:19] out the congregation to be sold out to
[1:46:22] God with zeal. And I pray that Sunday
[1:46:25] morning when you come here and Brother
[1:46:27] Lance is speaking that you'll have a
[1:46:29] fire in your bones. You won't come here
[1:46:32] late. You won't be visiting out in the
[1:46:34] fellowship room. You'll be here. You'll
[1:46:36] be in the Bible. You'll have the message
[1:46:37] book open. You'll be in prayer sing, "Oh
[1:46:40] God, speak to me."
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; And you come here and it'll be different
[1:46:47] over this pullpit.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I have the confidence
[1:46:55] tonight that the Holy Spirit has given
[1:46:57] me the confirmation that this is the
[1:47:00] message for this group of people that's
[1:47:02] here tonight for this congregation and
[1:47:04] that you're going to receive it and
[1:47:06] you're going to move on with God at a
[1:47:09] different level than you ever have
[1:47:11] before.
[1:47:12] And then we say amen.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; That is so be it. And that is it shall
[1:47:18] be so.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet.
[1:47:24] Why don't you offer your prayer to God?
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Why don't you tell God what's in your
[1:47:29] heart?
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; And hear me now, Lord.

[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Let your words match what's in your
[1:48:15] heart. Just tell them what's in your
[1:48:18] heart.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:48:22] Oh God, I've been cold. I've been away.
[1:48:23] I've been a drift.

[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; But fire of God.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; This is what the people need.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; This is what the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:48:37] needs.

[1:54:54] voice.
[1:54:56] And it told his love to me. But I long
[1:55:01] to rise. I have a zeal tonight to rise.
[1:55:07] A hunger and a thirst eating on me to
[1:55:10] rise
[1:55:12] so this temple could be more given over.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Yes. Do I have you as my friends, my

[1:55:28] need to close because we've got a young

[1:57:32] We're going to sing consecrate me now
[1:57:34] thy service. I want to give one word to
[1:57:37] the young men.
[1:57:40] Do you know why you struggle so much? Do
[1:57:42] you know why Satan works on your case so
[1:57:44] much? young men,
[1:57:47] not ignoring the young ladies, but you
[1:57:49] young men, is because God has ordained
[1:57:52] that you should be spiritual leaders.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; And Satan hates that
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; and he wars against that and he tries to
[1:58:00] occupy and fill you with all kinds of
[1:58:02] other things and you're energized to do
[1:58:04] all kinds of things that set the world
[1:58:06] on fire.
[1:58:08] Set it on fire, but set it on a godly
[1:58:10] fire.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You've got patterns. you've
[1:58:13] got. And that's why that's why maybe one
[1:58:15] or two of you, maybe a whole bunch of
[1:58:17] you are getting the message tonight.
[1:58:19] That's why Satan works on young men so
[1:58:21] much to distract them and fill your life
[1:58:24] with everything else cuz you're ordained
[1:58:27] of God to be a leader,
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; to be an example.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; And so when we sing this,
[1:58:35] I don't have to preach a long message.
[1:58:37] Just say that's for me.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Ed. You've now given me
[1:58:42] you've given me some you've given me
[1:58:44] some insight. I'm called of God by the
[1:58:48] word to be a leader and that I will be.
[1:58:51] I'll give myself to that in the name of
[1:58:53] Jesus Christ.
[1:58:57] Consecrate
[1:59:00] me now
[1:59:03] to my ser
[1:59:07] [Music]
[1:59:19] and let my soul
[1:59:24] come with A steadfast

[2:00:23] [Music]
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; As we close the service, we don't
[2:00:33] dismiss you from his presence. Those of
[2:00:36] you that need to slip away, you just
[2:00:38] slip away as you need. If you wish to
[2:00:40] remain and be in prayer,
[2:00:43] continue to do so.
[2:00:45] Just mind God,
[2:00:48] my gracious,
[2:00:50] loving, kind heavenly father, full of
[2:00:53] longsuffering and mercy,
[2:00:56] full of grace, full of love. You've
[2:01:00] shown it to us, Lord, tonight. You've
[2:01:02] shown it to us in our lifetime when we
[2:01:05] think of where we were in the darkness
[2:01:07] in the pit we were in and that how you
[2:01:09] loosed us. Oh, we're so thankful you
[2:01:11] came into the temple with a cord with a
[2:01:14] scourge and drove all the merchandisers
[2:01:17] out. Hallelujah. People are making
[2:01:20] merchandise of our lives and you set us
[2:01:22] free. And here we are now in a liberated
[2:01:26] place, in a liberated atmosphere. Oh
[2:01:28] father, I pray that every every person,
[2:01:31] oh God, as they have resolved and
[2:01:34] dedicated themselves to you, you will
[2:01:38] receive them. You'll receive this
[2:01:40] dedication. I'm thine, O Lord, and I've
[2:01:43] heard thy voice. You'll receive this
[2:01:46] dedication. Consecrate me now to thy
[2:01:49] service, oh God. Don't let me just be an
[2:01:52] idol one, but let me be a useful joint.
[2:01:54] That which every joint supply, let me be
[2:01:57] a supplying joint in the name of Jesus
[2:02:00] Christ for this temple of the Holy
[2:02:03] Ghost. Father, bless your people as they
[2:02:07] drive the highways. Keep them safe.
[2:02:10] Watch over them. I pray until we'll at
