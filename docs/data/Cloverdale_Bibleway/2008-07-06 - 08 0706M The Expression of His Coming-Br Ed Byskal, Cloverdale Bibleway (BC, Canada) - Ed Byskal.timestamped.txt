[18:10] got a few announcements here. Uh first
[18:13] off, we want to uh welcome everyone. And
[18:18] uh happy to have all those who are
[18:20] visiting with us. We have uh uh Brother
[18:23] John and Sister Sarah Stewart uh and

[18:36] And also, brother Henry Dick and his
[18:38] family are visiting from Calgary. Know,
[18:40] Brother Henry, may we get you to stand
[18:42] as well.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, in the fellowship room. Okay.
[18:48] There's a whole other congregation up
[18:50] there. I'm surprised. I mean, sometimes
[18:51] you walk out and there's uh seems like a
[18:54] couple hundred people out there.
[18:56] Um, we also, uh, and my, uh, apologies
[19:02] to Sister Anita and Brother Joseph for
[19:04] not, um, reading this out last week. I
[19:07] misplaced it. Um, but Brother Joseph and
[19:10] Sister Anita uh, Lei are proud to
[19:13] announce the arrival of their little
[19:16] baby girl. Kaylee Jolene is born June
[19:19] the 21st, weighing 7 pounds. Everyone is
[19:22] feeling just fine. So, that's wonderful.
[19:31] And we also are thankful for the Lord
[19:33] for the arrival of Max Jesse Bergen who
[19:37] arrived uh this week on Thursday coming
[19:40] in at 9 lb 9 o
[19:43] and not quite ready to start school but
[19:45] maybe next year.
[19:48] And uh we're thankful for the Lord for a
[19:51] another healthy grandchild. Amen.
[19:59] He he seems quite sedate given that he's
[20:02] we have the blending of brother Kim's
[20:04] jeans and my jeans in there. So, I
[20:08] wasn't sure what we uh what we had to
[20:10] expect, but uh he seems remarkably
[20:12] sedate. So, we're thankful for that as
[20:14] well. Brother Matthew
[20:37] Well, the works of the Lord have been
[20:41] great,
[20:42] and now he calls certain men to live
[20:47] holy
[20:49] as As the evening time grows late,
[20:55] there are those who are hungry and
[20:59] yearning.
[21:01] And though our strength may give way, we
[21:05] must all the more pray for so many still
[21:09] have not heard the call.
[21:16] So I'll keep on sharing the word
[21:23] with anyone's ears that are open.
[21:28] And if the world turns their head and
[21:32] I'm left here standing alone,
[21:36] my stopping place will be my heavenly
[21:40] home.
[21:48] We are the ones who are chosen to speak
[21:53] of all the truth and the life we've been
[21:58] given.
[22:00] Let us go where his spirit does lead
[22:06] and testify of our father in heaven.
[22:12] And though we face unbelief,
[22:15] still his word we must keep. There'll be
[22:18] so many who won't answer their calling.
[22:26] But I'll keep on sharing the word
[22:33] with anyone's ears that are open.
[22:39] And if the world turns their head and
[22:42] I'm left here standing alone,
[22:46] my stopping place will be my heavenly
[22:50] home.
[22:51] Let us keep on sharing the word
[22:58] with anyone's ears that are open.
[23:04] And if the world turns their head and
[23:08] we're left here standing alone,
[23:11] our starting place will be our heavenly
[23:15] home.
[23:17] When the world turns their head and
[23:21] they're left here standing alone,
[23:24] our dwelling place will be our heavenly
[23:28] home.
[23:49] Thanks, brother Matthew.
[23:52] I certainly do want to share the word. I
[23:54] got up this morning uh early and had a
[23:58] an email from a sister
[24:03] Don't know who she is. Don't know where
[24:04] she's from, but she would she'd stumbled
[24:06] onto the website, believe the sign, and
[24:09] said, "Boy, I'm interested in Brother
[24:13] Brandham's ministry. I've heard bad
[24:14] things. I've heard good things, but I'm
[24:16] interested in the truth." And uh
[24:19] certainly we want to make sure that we
[24:21] get the word out to everyone who's
[24:22] hungry. Amen. Thirsting for the truth.
[24:26] Got a wonderful testimony here from our
[24:28] brother Bob Hansen and then our sister
[24:30] Natasha Hoyer has a song for us. Sister
[24:33] Natasha, if you could come. Um, get
[24:36] ready. Uh, brother Bob said, "On our
[24:38] recent return from Europe, I had
[24:40] contacted a serious and worsening
[24:42] infection. The doctor was making
[24:44] arrangements for me to see the head of
[24:46] infectious diseases because three
[24:48] medications I was given were not
[24:50] working. The ministry laid hands on me,
[24:53] anointed me with oil, and we prayed a
[24:55] prayer of faith. The next morning, um
[24:58] while in prayer, the affection broke.
[25:00] Satan was defeated. I am perfectly well.
[25:03] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[25:11] Thankful for the healing touch of God.
[25:15] Amen. A couple of announcements as well.

[25:20] the grounds during camp in an RV or a
[25:24] trailer, please complete an RV
[25:27] registration form, which are now
[25:29] available at the ties and offering box
[25:32] uh out in the foyer. They can't
[25:34] accommodate tents.
[25:37] So, um, unfortunately, they they if you
[25:40] if you thinking about going and staying
[25:41] on a tent, that's not going to work. But
[25:43] they can take RVs and trailers. Oh,
[25:46] please uh see u get one of the forms at
[25:48] the back and fill it out. Also, a note
[25:51] from brother Richard. Please do not
[25:53] bring any more clothing for the Ukraine
[25:55] and Siberia until after camp. They
[25:58] currently have more than enough. So,
[26:00] thanks everyone who's been bringing
[26:02] things in. Sister Natasha
[26:23] High upon this mountain,
[26:27] the sun is shining bright.
[26:31] My heart is filled with gladness.
[26:35] here above the cares of life.
[26:40] But I've just come through the valley
[26:44] of trouble, fear, and pain.
[26:48] It was there I came to know my God
[26:53] enough to stand and say,
[26:59] "Even in the valley, God is good.
[27:08] Even in the valley,
[27:11] he is faithful and true.
[27:16] He carries his children through like he
[27:21] said he would
[27:24] even in the valley.
[27:29] God is good.
[27:34] This road of life has led you through a
[27:39] valley of defeat.
[27:43] You wonder if the father
[27:47] has heard your desperate plea.
[27:50] There is hope in that rugged place where
[27:55] tears of sorrow dwell.
[27:58] Can you hear him gently whispering?
[28:03] I'm here and all is well.
[28:09] Even in the valley, God is good.
[28:17] Even in the valley,
[28:20] he is faithful and true.
[28:24] He carries his children through like he
[28:30] said he would.
[28:33] Even in the valley, God is good.
[28:45] Even in the valley, God is good.
[28:53] Even in the valley,
[28:56] he is faithful and true.
[29:00] He carries his children through like he
[29:05] said he would.
[29:08] Even in the valley, God is good.
[29:16] Even in the valley,
[29:23] God is good.
[29:38] Amen.
[29:41] Thanks, Sister Natasha. In everything,
[29:43] give him thanks. Give him thanks. Let's
[29:45] sing it together. We're going to be
[29:46] turning to the word at this time as

[29:54] everything
[29:58] give him thanks.

[31:00] Give him thanks.
[31:12] Heat.
[31:20] Heat.
[31:36] here
[31:44] in the good times.
[31:46] In the good times,
[31:49] praise
[31:51] his name.
[32:10] Once again a good I
[32:34] feel
[32:46] I trust we're very grateful people
[32:49] &gt;&gt; today. We have so much to thank him for.
[32:52] Just so much to thank him for. Do you
[32:56] feel a sense of worship in your heart?
[32:59] You've been worshiping, singing.
[33:02] It's good to praise the Lord
[33:05] &gt;&gt; even when you don't feel like it.
[33:08] David said, "I will say to my soul,
[33:11] praise the Lord."
[33:13] &gt;&gt; So if you feel like it, praise him. If
[33:15] you don't feel like it, just say to your
[33:17] soul, "Praise him."
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One thing you'll know,
[33:21] you're doing the right thing.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[33:25] We're uh looking forward to a wonderful
[33:29] evening on this coming Wednesday. You'll
[33:32] want to be sure and be here. Uh the
[33:35] brothers have just all returned. Brother
[33:37] Ernie, brother Kim, brother Michael from
[33:41] the Philippines
[33:42] and uh this has been the launching of
[33:46] the hub network. Uh it has ignited an
[33:51] enthusiasm amongst the ministers,
[33:54] amongst the churches, amongst the
[33:56] people, amongst uh young men in the
[34:00] congregations that have been able to lay
[34:03] hold and see this vision. and it has
[34:06] really sparked something in the country
[34:08] the Philippines. So, we're going to be
[34:10] hearing from each of the brethren and
[34:13] you'll be seeing uh also you'll be here
[34:16] Wednesday, Brother Ernie for sure. And
[34:19] uh so you'll be able to really have
[34:21] we're taking the whole service uh just
[34:25] for uh that
[34:28] not a report as such but what God has
[34:30] done and what God is doing. And uh each
[34:33] of these brothers will take a a part of
[34:35] the service and we're really looking
[34:37] forward to that. Uh tomorrow on Monday
[34:43] we are having the service for our sister
[34:46] Menedic.
[34:47] Uh
[34:49] we had I thought it was announced on
[34:52] Wednesday. Uh but I don't know if the
[34:54] arrangements were fully made yet, but
[34:57] it'll be 100 p.m. tomorrow afternoon
[35:01] uh here in the church. And this is the
[35:03] first Sunday we don't have our sister
[35:05] Menace sitting with brother Jake. And I
[35:09] know it's a it's not just a space
[35:11] sitting beside him uh that is there now,
[35:15] but it's a big vacancy in his heart as
[35:17] well and in the heart of the family. And
[35:20] so we're going to save our comments for
[35:22] tomorrow, but I will say this. She was a
[35:24] mother indeed.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; She was a mother indeed. She was in her
[35:29] quietness.
[35:31] And many of you, perhaps most of us here
[35:34] don't know what you will know by
[35:36] tomorrow afternoon, but she was
[35:39] certainly a mother indeed. I will just
[35:42] make this comment. I'm going to make it
[35:44] tomorrow as well, but there may be a
[35:45] good number of you that won't be able to
[35:47] be here because of work, because of
[35:50] travel, distance, and whatever more.
[35:53] You know, we have little happenings in
[35:56] our life and at the moment it just
[36:00] something sparks in your mind and you
[36:02] think, "Well, that kind of stood out and
[36:04] that was different and and but you what
[36:07] you don't realize at the moment is that
[36:10] that moment is going to stay with you
[36:12] the rest of your life." Or those few
[36:15] words, they're going to stay locked in
[36:17] your mind. And while you'll forget a lot
[36:19] of things that you think are important,
[36:22] there'll be that little sentence that
[36:24] you'll never never forget. And I
[36:27] remember when brother Brandham took the
[36:30] hand of a woman.
[36:33] Remember it like it was five minutes ago
[36:37] and he just took her hand and here I am
[36:39] just a a teenager took her hand because
[36:43] that's where the discernment was at that
[36:45] time. And he just went like this.
[36:49] The hand of a mother.
[36:54] That never left me.
[36:56] It spoke such volumes not only of the
[36:59] woman, but that that was what a prophet
[37:03] of God would notice.
[37:06] The hand of a mother.
[37:08] There was something about
[37:11] that hand that worked hard. And it's
[37:14] amazing.
[37:16] But that is exactly what I felt when I
[37:21] shook sister Mena's hand. Every time I
[37:25] thought the hand of a mother say God
[37:28] bless her soul rest her gallant soul and
[37:32] she's certainly has a heritage here with
[37:36] many of the children of the family.
[37:40] So we'll be honoring her life and
[37:42] remembering her tomorrow afternoon at
[37:44] 1:00. And I understand there's a viewing
[37:47] at 10:30.
[37:49] That will be at Henderson's
[37:51] at Henderson's funeral home in uh
[37:53] Langley.
[37:56] So, God bless you as we gather tomorrow.
[38:00] We also want to thank God for the
[38:04] wonderful day we had yesterday. for all
[38:06] of you that were able to come out to the
[38:08] camp and there were hundreds of you. Uh
[38:11] we put a good test on the deck and uh uh
[38:16] I was standing beside one of the
[38:18] brothers who was involved in the
[38:20] construction and he says it might you
[38:23] know it was like it was going to sag a
[38:25] wee bit and I said I I think it was made
[38:28] real well. You brothers did a good job.
[38:30] It's not no he said we want it to
[38:31] settle. We we want all this weight on
[38:34] here because we can adjust it back where
[38:37] it should be. And I don't think it gave
[38:39] even a quarter of an inch with several
[38:42] hundred people on it. I want to commend
[38:44] the brothers that worked and and all who
[38:46] have been there. And I also we did not
[38:50] yesterday, but I want to thank our
[38:52] brother Raymond who's not here this
[38:53] morning. Uh he's at home with the little
[38:56] fellows, you know, is in a cast. Little
[38:59] Nathan is in a cast from his hips down
[39:02] and we'll be for five weeks
[39:05] uh because he broke the his legs. And so
[39:09] we want to thank brother Raymond
[39:12] and uh we're we're really really
[39:15] appreciate him and he roasted uh that
[39:19] beef for all of us and it was just
[39:22] wonderful. They started early and
[39:24] there's a lot of preparation and getting
[39:26] the barbecues and hauling them down and
[39:29] just a lot of work and we appreciate
[39:32] those kind of those kind of works and
[39:35] endeavors and it you know we go there
[39:37] and enjoy it and so many of you have
[39:39] commented and if you shake brother
[39:41] Raymond's hand you can thank him. you
[39:43] sisters that also labored and worked
[39:46] with him. We just appreciate it. And for
[39:49] myself, it was just so satisfying, so
[39:53] wonderful to see all the senior young
[39:56] people that were there as tour guides.
[39:58] How many took a tour? Could you just
[40:00] raise your hand? Sorry. Wonderful.
[40:04] How many of you that took a tour didn't
[40:06] know that that all existed there? Let me
[40:09] see your hands. Good. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.
[40:13] Well, wonderful.
[40:16] I I'm sure there were more, but it was
[40:19] wonderful to see. And then uh Brother
[40:22] Tom Frey took charge of the parking with
[40:24] all the junior young fellows. And I tell
[40:27] you what,
[40:29] they they had a spirit of policemen on
[40:32] them. And I drove in there, you know,
[40:36] the little fellows 12 or 13 years old or
[40:39] even less and all of their vests on and
[40:43] the authority that went with it and
[40:45] says, "Oh, brother Biscll, you go right
[40:47] over there and park right beside Tom's
[40:48] car under that tree over there." And I
[40:50] said, "Well, you know, I'm going to kind
[40:53] of take it quite not that o that as
[40:56] officious." And the other two that were
[40:57] standing there and they're just standing
[40:59] at attention. I thought, "Well, maybe
[41:00] I'll go over and park by." No, no. He
[41:02] said, "You just go straight ahead.
[41:03] Straight ahead. Just go straight up
[41:05] there and park there on that uh right
[41:07] beside Brother Tom's car." Said, "Okay."
[41:09] Yes, sir.
[41:12] That changed that right away. I said,
[41:14] "Wonderful to see them coming up.
[41:16] Thanks, Mother Tom and Brother Jess and
[41:19] Sister Lynn and helping to arrange
[41:21] things. We We're just so thankful. It
[41:24] was a wonderful day." And that that was
[41:26] just like a little prelude
[41:28] to the camp,
[41:30] &gt;&gt; to our family camp. And I can tell you
[41:33] that it will indeed be and take on not
[41:36] only the appearance, but I believe that
[41:39] God was in it. And it will indeed be
[41:41] family.
[41:43] There isn't a lot of places for us to go
[41:45] as a family.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Isn't it a wonderful atmosphere out
[41:49] there? I know that you felt that. It's a
[41:51] wonderful atmosphere. It's an atmosphere
[41:53] of peace, isn't it? You imagine if we
[41:55] feel it, what others feel, we have a
[41:57] place that we can go besides being here
[42:00] at church. So, God bless you all. Uh
[42:04] let's stand and maybe let's uh just sing
[42:07] a song.
[42:09] I just want to worship him somehow.
[42:14] Let's do something. Help me, brother
[42:16] Rod. Will you? I want to sing the first
[42:17] verse of blessed assurance. Jesus is
[42:20] mine.
[42:22] You're singing my favorite song.
[42:26] This is my story.
[42:29] This is my song. Praising my savior all
[42:32] the day long. First verse, please.
[42:36] Blessed assures.
[42:48] Oh,
[42:53] our glory.
[43:00] of salvation.
[43:07] God
[43:11] born of his
[43:16] and
[43:18] his
[43:20] lift.
[43:22] This is my story.
[43:28] This is my
[43:33] I'm praising my
[43:46] is my story.
[43:51] This is my song.
[43:56] Praising my savior
[44:02] all the day.
[44:07] Join with me in prayer, would you
[44:08] please?
[44:11] Almighty God, our father in heaven, we
[44:15] are approaching you.
[44:18] We're approaching you softly,
[44:21] humbly, for your prophet said that God's
[44:25] people are humble people.
[44:27] We're recognizing and confessing that we
[44:30] are nothing in ourselves. What we are,
[44:33] we can only thank you for, Lord. And we
[44:37] pray that today that your Holy Spirit
[44:39] will merge, oh God, filling us, merge,
[44:43] oh God, and take control of this human
[44:46] spirit and these human thoughts and
[44:49] mind. I pray, oh God, that the Holy
[44:52] Spirit will have such preeminence that
[44:55] you'll take control and cast out every
[44:58] doubt and every question, cast out every
[45:01] hindrance, oh God. And we want to come,
[45:04] Father. We want to, as we have already,
[45:07] worship you in spirit and in truth. For
[45:10] those that sang specials, Lord, thank
[45:13] you for their uh con contribution. Oh
[45:16] God, for all that are making this
[45:19] service possible. We thank you for that.
[45:21] But yet all of that will be in vain
[45:24] unless you by your presence settle
[45:27] amongst us. OH GOD, MAKE US CONSCIOUS of
[45:30] the Holy Spirit. Make us conscious of
[45:32] the angels of God standing at their
[45:35] posts of duty. Make us conscious, oh
[45:38] God, of the very presence of Jesus
[45:40] Christ that is amongst us now in such a
[45:43] way. Oh Lord, you have testified to it
[45:46] with this glorious message which you
[45:49] have sent. Thank you for the voice, OH
[45:51] GOD. THANK YOU for the message that
[45:53] you've given us. We have substance to
[45:55] believe. We have the promises that have
[45:57] been unveiled. Oh Lord Jesus, we thank
[46:00] you. And now we pray that you will
[46:02] anoint us, oh God, as hearers and I as
[46:06] called on now to speak. I pray, Father,
[46:08] that the Holy Spirit will utter the
[46:11] words that should be spoken and that you
[46:13] will have your perfect way throughout
[46:14] this day in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[46:18] And everybody could say,
[46:20] &gt;&gt; "So be it." Amen.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Remembering there's no service this
[46:23] evening. We're one service during the
[46:26] summer vacation time. I'll have you turn
[46:28] in your Bibles, please, to Mark, the
[46:31] 13th chapter. We'll read a few verses.
[46:36] And I'll ask for your undivided
[46:37] attention and as little movement as
[46:40] possible.
[46:41] The Lord willing, I have also some
[46:43] slides which we didn't get to last week.
[46:45] And now I've added a few of quotes that
[46:50] we've been going over for the last few
[46:53] meetings.
[46:55] And this really is going on from the
[46:58] message
[47:01] Christ the mystery of God in you. So I'm
[47:05] I'm just giving it a different title
[47:07] because I this would be more or less the
[47:10] subject the expression of his coming.
[47:14] We're starting at verse 31. Heaven and
[47:16] earth shall pass away but my words shall
[47:19] not pass away. But of that day and that
[47:23] hour knoweth no man, know not the angels
[47:27] which are in heaven, neither the son,
[47:30] but the father. And if you were to read
[47:33] uh further in the chapter, you'll find
[47:35] that Jesus is speaking about his coming.
[47:39] And so we'll look at the 32nd verse
[47:41] again. But of that day, and that hour,
[47:45] knoweth no man, know not the angels
[47:49] which are in heaven, neither the Son,
[47:52] but the Father.
[47:55] Take ye heed, watch and pray, for you
[47:58] know not when the time is. For the Son
[48:01] of Man is as a man, taking a far
[48:04] journey, who left his house, and gave
[48:07] authority to his servants, and to every
[48:10] man his work, and commanded the porter
[48:13] to watch. Watch ye therefore, for ye
[48:17] know not when the master of the house
[48:19] cometh, at even or at midnight, or at
[48:23] the crowing, or in the morning,
[48:26] lest coming suddenly he find you
[48:28] sleeping. And what I say unto you, I say
[48:32] unto all. Watch.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you have your
[48:37] seat.
[48:43] We are all interested and very keenly
[48:46] interested, I'm sure, where we are
[48:48] today.
[48:50] uh in the last meeting we spoke of
[48:54] because we are here because we know that
[48:59] we didn't bring ourselves here God has
[49:01] brought us here we need to go to him who
[49:05] brought us and ask him what does he want
[49:08] us to do
[49:10] uh and anyone that goes even a soldier
[49:15] goes to war he does not go with his own
[49:18] charge
[49:20] He goes by commission. He's
[49:21] commissioned.
[49:23] Not only is he commissioned, but he's
[49:25] also equipped.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Not only is he equipped, he's also
[49:28] trained.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; And so God has not put us here
[49:33] untrained,
[49:35] unequipped,
[49:37] or uncommissioned. We're here on a
[49:38] commission.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; And that was one of the things that John
[49:42] the Baptist could first say that I'm one
[49:45] cent. that was that was supremely
[49:48] important. I've been sent here and he
[49:51] knew who sent him and he knew that he
[49:54] had been equipped and those things are
[49:56] all important. So we say now uh I I
[50:00] would like to just summarize very very
[50:03] briefly going back into the very very we
[50:07] can't say the beginnings because with
[50:08] God there is no beginning but at some
[50:11] point at some point in in in the in
[50:16] God's mind he began to uh let his
[50:20] thoughts to become words so that he
[50:23] could speak things and bring them into
[50:25] existence and cause them to materialize.
[50:27] lies. So, and that was what was called
[50:31] the the the word or the logos of God.
[50:34] The logos is simply a Greek word that
[50:38] that refers back to the word, the spoken
[50:41] word. And so, the logos, in other words,
[50:45] it wasn't just what was coming forth
[50:47] from God, but it was the fact that God
[50:50] had determined that the that he shall
[50:53] now express and make himself known. So
[50:56] he began to pour out of himself this
[50:59] logos
[51:00] &gt;&gt; or word which had been thought. He was a
[51:04] self-existent one that existed all by
[51:06] himself. There's only one God, the
[51:10] eternal God. We agree with that one God.
[51:13] And so this God had in him
[51:17] characteristics,
[51:18] attributes, qualities. And brother
[51:21] Brandham uses the word attributes so
[51:24] many times. And then it is evident from
[51:27] the scripture and in the message Christ
[51:30] the mystery of God revealed who I'll be
[51:31] making many references to again today
[51:34] that that God had this uh within himself
[51:40] this uh ambition this desire this uh
[51:45] motive to express himself and and and
[51:50] it's it's a force it's a power it is
[51:54] something that is beyond human
[51:56] description. So no words that I have uh
[52:00] or that we have uh within ourselves is
[52:04] able to describe this uh power, this
[52:08] thrusting
[52:10] God must reveal himself. So he needs to
[52:13] express himself and thus came the word.
[52:17] So he began to speak, "Let there be. Let
[52:20] there be." And there was.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "If he said, "Let
[52:24] there be light and there came a fog." It
[52:26] wasn't God.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; It wasn't from his thought. So he began
[52:29] to speak and this outpouring and he
[52:32] gives these he gives these various
[52:34] descriptions. And I know that this is
[52:35] fundamental to many of you that attend
[52:38] here, but he gave he gave these uh uh
[52:42] other descriptive words to this
[52:44] outpouring. He said it was the
[52:45] anointing.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; It was the logos. It was the word. He
[52:50] talks about the little light that went
[52:52] out. Calls it like a little light went
[52:54] out from God in its beginning and it was
[52:58] the anointing and it was the it was the
[53:01] son of God. He said now it wasn't Jesus
[53:04] because Jesus was born, but it was the
[53:06] son of God. So by him were all things
[53:09] made and without him was nothing made
[53:11] that is made. So God, now what is the
[53:16] son? A son is an expression of the
[53:18] father.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; See what I mean? So it all meshes
[53:22] together. It was the expression of God
[53:25] coming. And the and the the method that
[53:27] he was using is it would be a word form
[53:30] because then a thought now becomes a
[53:32] word. So he spoke it but it was a word
[53:35] not like you speak but it was a word of
[53:37] power.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; It was a word of energy. It was a word
[53:41] that would achieve what was in his mind.
[53:43] It was the logos. And that word has
[53:46] never lost its power.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; That's why the promises of God are yay
[53:52] and amen to everyone that believeth. And
[53:56] so God also put that into place that if
[53:59] if if his creation would believe him,
[54:02] they would be benefited. If they would
[54:04] doubt it, they would lose everything.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; See what I mean?
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so now this was the process of
[54:12] the anointing. Now here we are today
[54:15] and that which was poured out of God
[54:18] has come all down through the centuries.
[54:22] But God because it was something that
[54:26] was internally within God and was coming
[54:28] out and being expressed.
[54:31] The expression within itself did not
[54:34] necessarily reveal to the humans what it
[54:38] was. as he expressed it. They could see
[54:41] the manifestation but didn't always were
[54:44] not always able to grasp what it was
[54:47] they were looking at.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; I hope this doesn't sound too mystical
[54:51] to you. But but God can manifest and I
[54:54] showed it in a number of places. God can
[54:56] manifest himself and people could look
[54:58] right at the manifestation which Jesus
[55:01] Christ himself was. I'll just refer to
[55:03] him. He was the perfect image of God on
[55:08] earth, was he not?
[55:09] &gt;&gt; And how many looked at him? Very, very
[55:12] few could identify that he was God
[55:15] manifested in the flesh.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Because now that took a revelation on
[55:20] the individual level. God by his spirit
[55:23] need to reveal to you what that was. And
[55:26] that is why Jesus asked that critical
[55:29] question. Who do men say that I am? And
[55:31] they had various answers. And then he
[55:33] said to the disciples, "But who do you
[55:35] say that I am?" And brother Brandham
[55:37] said he was asking the church. When he
[55:40] talked to his disciples, he was asking
[55:41] the church. And so now here we are as
[55:44] the as the church, the bride of Jesus
[55:46] Christ. And that question still holds
[55:48] today. But who DO YOU SAY? NOT WHO THAT
[55:51] WAS, who this is.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Who do you say this word is? Who do you
[55:57] say is this word the logos to you? Is
[56:00] this word the outpouring from God to you
[56:03] that has rippled on down through the
[56:05] centuries of time? Who do you say this
[56:07] is? WHO DO YOU SAY this is in bride
[56:10] form? Who do you say this is within this
[56:13] BUILDING TODAY? WHO DO YOU SAY THIS IS
[56:15] THAT'S sitting next to you? Be it
[56:17] husband, wife, young person, brother,
[56:19] sister, WHOEVER IT IS, WHO DO YOU SAY
[56:21] THAT it is? And when you say it's
[56:23] Christ,
[56:24] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, then that means that's what
[56:26] came out from God at the very beginning.
[56:29] and has come on DOWN TO THIS TIME. THIS
[56:32] IS CHRIST.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; And so then what is Christ?
[56:38] &gt;&gt; What is this anointing here to achieve?
[56:42] Brother Brandham said the logos in the
[56:44] message, show us the father.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; It's very very important. Show us the
[56:50] father. Said the logos went out of God
[56:53] which was the Christ, the anointing that
[56:56] went out. And then in attitude and who
[56:59] is God? said that was the logos that
[57:03] went out of God in the beginning. That
[57:05] was the son of God that came out of the
[57:08] bosom of the father. Jesus said he came
[57:10] out of the bosom of the father and that
[57:13] he would go back. He said that was in
[57:16] the beginning was the word and the word
[57:18] was with God and the word was God.
[57:21] And then he said this, "And in the
[57:23] beginning was God, and then out of God
[57:26] came the logos, a part of God that went
[57:29] out of God." And so when we we have to
[57:33] conclude that if we agree and you agree
[57:36] with we have agreement this morning that
[57:38] that that which is here with us is
[57:42] Christ.
[57:44] And you have to say this is the same
[57:47] what I'm sitting beside and what is in
[57:50] this service today is the same one that
[57:53] was in the burning bush with Moses.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; This is the same one that called Samuel.
[57:59] Samuel. Samuel. Samuel. THIS IS THE SAME
[58:02] ONE that David worshiped.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. THIS IS THE SAME ONE THAT
[58:08] CAME AND WALKED ON EARTH in the body
[58:10] called Jesus Christ. THIS IS THE SAME
[58:13] ONE THAT WAS WITH THE PROPHET of God in
[58:16] this generation when he said there's a
[58:17] light and it hangs over the man there
[58:19] hangs over the WOMAN HERE. THE SAME ONE
[58:22] IS HERE TODAY. NOT A NOT A WATERED DOWN
[58:26] ONE. THE SAME ONE. Not a weakened one.
[58:29] THE SAME ONE. HALLELUJAH. THE SAME ONE
[58:32] WHO SAID, "I'M ALIVE AND I LIVE FOREVER
[58:36] MORE AND BECAUSE I LIVE, YOU SHALL LIVE
[58:38] ALSO." The same one. If you can believe
[58:42] that to the degree God wants you to
[58:44] believe that, this service will be a
[58:46] different service for you. Your problems
[58:48] will melt in that presence. Hallelujah.
[58:52] YOUR QUESTIONS WILL BE DISSOLVED IN THAT
[58:54] PRESENCE. HALLELUJAH. THE THINGS YOU
[58:57] THINK ARE IMPORTANT WILL BECOME
[58:58] NON-EXISTENT IN THAT PRESENCE. THE
[59:01] THINGS OF THIS WORLD WILL GROW STRANGELY
[59:04] DIM IN THAT PRESENCE. THE DESIRES YOU
[59:07] HAVE WHICH ARE ILL DESIRES, WRONG
[59:09] DESIRES WILL MELT AND GO AWAY IN THAT
[59:12] PRESENCE. HALLELUJAH. SATAN CANNOT LIVE
[59:16] IN THAT PRESENCE. HE CANNOT FUNCTION IN
[59:19] THAT PRESENCE. YOU NEED DELIVERANCE.
[59:22] IT'S HERE NOW.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Only believe.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Only believe.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; All things are possible.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We cannot put any
[59:35] restrictions on him.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; So the unfolding of this mystery of God
[59:42] and the mystery was his self-expression
[59:46] all down through the types and shadows
[59:49] and then in the final fulfillment
[59:52] Christ the mystery of God revealed he
[59:54] said now down through the ages he has
[59:57] been slowly unfolding
[1:00:00] the mystery.
[1:00:02] So all the acts of the believers down
[1:00:04] through the scriptures in the Old
[1:00:06] Testament has been expressing what God's
[1:00:09] great goal is.
[1:00:12] And I'd like you to note that the plan
[1:00:15] of redemption,
[1:00:17] even the plan of redemption remained a
[1:00:20] mystery
[1:00:21] while it was in types and shadows
[1:00:24] and even while it was in fulfillment.
[1:00:29] So the plan of redemption
[1:00:32] to redeem a fallen human race
[1:00:35] to pay the supreme sacrifice even all of
[1:00:38] that remained a mystery
[1:00:41] all through the ages.
[1:00:44] You need to stay with me very closely
[1:00:46] because I'm coming to your address.
[1:00:50] And even while it was in fulfillment in
[1:00:53] Jesus Christ upon the cross, it was
[1:00:56] still a mystery even to the his closest
[1:00:59] confidance in his disciples.
[1:01:02] So I DON'T CARE HOW SPIRITUAL YOU are
[1:01:05] here today
[1:01:06] or what man you may have confidence in,
[1:01:10] what minister, I can tell you that there
[1:01:13] are aspects of what is happening today
[1:01:16] as a result of God's fulfillment in this
[1:01:19] message and the ongoing
[1:01:22] uh rippling out of this message, the
[1:01:24] fulfillment of it, it is still a mystery
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; to a lot of people
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; and there are aspects of it that are min
[1:01:32] a mystery to all of us.
[1:01:36] And why is that? I'll tell you in
[1:01:38] advance and then I'm going to come to
[1:01:39] it. It's because we don't understand our
[1:01:42] own life.
[1:01:44] Our own life is a mystery. And I'm going
[1:01:46] to show you in the scripture from those
[1:01:49] that have lived that God has called that
[1:01:53] God put his hand upon and called them
[1:01:57] his elected his children that the things
[1:02:00] that were happening in their lives, the
[1:02:03] things that were in particular
[1:02:06] mysterious to them was the very hand of
[1:02:09] God
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; more so than their daily labors and
[1:02:14] their daily striving. and all of their
[1:02:16] ups and downs and so on. That was just,
[1:02:18] you know, part of life. But in the in in
[1:02:21] in in
[1:02:24] the the essence of their life,
[1:02:27] God was actually in control of that.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; So he says also, therefore, the entire
[1:02:37] Bible is the revelation of God's mystery
[1:02:40] in Christ. The entire Bible
[1:02:43] is God's mystery in Christ. The entire
[1:02:47] Bible is an expression and the message
[1:02:50] I'm speaking to you today I have
[1:02:52] entitled the expression of his coming.
[1:02:56] And where I'm going to come down to your
[1:02:58] address is that you and I, I say by
[1:03:02] grace are the expression of Christ's
[1:03:06] coming,
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; his second coming.
[1:03:10] Our lives are the expression of his
[1:03:13] coming.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; You may wonder right away if you have a
[1:03:16] self-examination say, "How in the world
[1:03:20] is my life expressing?"
[1:03:22] Well, I intend to prove to you in the
[1:03:25] scriptures that we are expressing nay
[1:03:29] even now his second coming.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; We are not just another church.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; We are not just another gathering of
[1:03:36] people.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; The people that have gathered all over,
[1:03:39] they have their creeds and they have
[1:03:41] their dogmas. They have their programs.
[1:03:46] They have whatever it is they're
[1:03:47] established on and that's what they're
[1:03:50] expressing. We only have one thing that
[1:03:54] we believe that God has sent his word.
[1:03:59] We believe that it is not a man's word.
[1:04:02] It is thus saith the Lord.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; And if we believe that, then we believe
[1:04:06] that is the same that came out from God
[1:04:09] in the very very beginning as far as our
[1:04:12] understanding is that God began to pour
[1:04:15] out of himself and continues to pour out
[1:04:17] of himself even to this day. AND THE
[1:04:20] ANOINTING which we have received which
[1:04:22] is actually the living word of God. That
[1:04:25] is the anointing. The anointing is not a
[1:04:27] feeling or a sensation. The anointing is
[1:04:29] this word of God made alive in its
[1:04:32] generation IN ITS SEASON. WE HAVE
[1:04:35] RECEIVED THAT. WE HAVE received the
[1:04:37] anointing which was the logos which was
[1:04:40] the initial outpouring of God WHICH WAS
[1:04:43] THE SON OF GOD. WE HAVE RECEIVED THAT.
[1:04:45] WE'VE RECEIVED THE SON. WE'VE RECEIVED
[1:04:47] THE ANOINTING. WE'VE RECEIVED THE LORD
[1:04:50] God
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; for this day and I can prove to you by
[1:04:53] the scripture that this day it was sent
[1:04:57] as the coming.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; So he said therefore the Bible is the
[1:05:05] revelation of God's mystery. And then he
[1:05:08] makes this statement. He wanted to
[1:05:09] achieve his one purpose. Let me read it.
[1:05:12] The entire Bible is an expression of one
[1:05:16] goal. The entire Bible, I'm going to go
[1:05:19] slowly. The entire Bible, he said, is an
[1:05:23] expression
[1:05:25] of one goal that God had,
[1:05:29] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[1:05:33] entire Bible.
[1:05:35] And all the acts and conjunction all the
[1:05:40] acts of the believers in the Bible
[1:05:44] has been in type and expressing what
[1:05:48] God's great goal is.
[1:05:51] And God's great goal I ask I also stress
[1:05:56] to you and want to do it so again
[1:06:00] his great goal
[1:06:02] and the great mystery that he's always
[1:06:04] held in his mind the apex of that
[1:06:08] mystery is when he descends down into
[1:06:13] man's sphere in his personal presence
[1:06:17] and makes himself personally acquainted
[1:06:21] That is the supreme apex of God's
[1:06:24] mystery.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; And because it's a mystery, he can do
[1:06:28] it. And the multitudes don't know it.
[1:06:32] Even most don't know it. And we may know
[1:06:35] it in part. But I want to shake your
[1:06:40] thinking today
[1:06:42] and perhaps say some things that may
[1:06:44] raise more questions, which will be
[1:06:47] fine. But I want you to ponder them.
[1:06:50] So all the acts of the believers in the
[1:06:54] Bible, do you believe you're in the
[1:06:56] Bible?
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; So it includes you.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; All the acts of the believers in the
[1:07:02] Bible has been in type
[1:07:05] and expressing
[1:07:07] what God's great goal is.
[1:07:10] Then he asked the question, now why
[1:07:12] didn't he keep Adam and Eve like that?
[1:07:15] Why didn't he just keep Adam and Eve?
[1:07:18] In Adam and Eve, he could say that he's
[1:07:21] a father.
[1:07:24] In Adam and Eve, he could say, "I have a
[1:07:27] son and his bride."
[1:07:30] In Adam and Eve, in Adam, I don't know
[1:07:33] if you've ever thought of this, but Adam
[1:07:34] had pure blood.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; If God just needed pure blood on the
[1:07:41] cross,
[1:07:43] Adam had pure blood.
[1:07:45] It wasn't contaminated.
[1:07:48] Why didn't he leave and just keep Adam
[1:07:51] and Eve like that? I've never heard of a
[1:07:52] minister any place or I've never heard
[1:07:54] of anything that even asked that kind of
[1:07:56] a question. It's a very very uh
[1:08:00] thoughtprovoking question. Why didn't he
[1:08:02] leave them like that? And it is also his
[1:08:05] answer. He answers it because the answer
[1:08:08] so marvelous because it includes us. He
[1:08:10] said then he would never have been able
[1:08:13] to express his fullness or his full
[1:08:15] attribute because even though Adam and
[1:08:18] Eve were perfect within their own units,
[1:08:21] it they could not express what God had
[1:08:23] within him which only you can express.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S A UNIQUENESS ABOUT YOURSELF
[1:08:30] IN SPITE OF YOU OR WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT
[1:08:31] YOURSELF OR IN SPITE OF WHAT YOUR
[1:08:34] FRAILTIES MIGHT BE. THERE'S A UNIQUENESS
[1:08:36] IN YOUR EXISTENCE THAT ONLY CAN ONLY YOU
[1:08:39] CAN EXPRESS HIM.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; That's where it gets real tight. You
[1:08:46] have to believe that.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe that, you're not
[1:08:49] going to get much out of the rest of the
[1:08:50] service.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; You've been sent here to express the
[1:08:56] word for this moment.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; And the word for this moment has to do
[1:09:00] with his coming.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:04] Yeah,
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; he would never have been able. He said
[1:09:08] he could have been a father there. That
[1:09:10] is true cuz he had Adam and Eve. He
[1:09:12] could have been a father there, but also
[1:09:15] he's a savior.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; And in that state, THERE WAS NOTHING TO
[1:09:19] SAVE. So that attribute WAS THRUSTING
[1:09:22] OUT. IT MUST BE MANIFESTED.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; This is where you have to really
[1:09:28] understand God. So something had to
[1:09:30] fall. Right. Amen.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; The children had to sin. The children
[1:09:35] had to disbelieve. God didn't make them
[1:09:38] do it. But he created the circumstances
[1:09:40] so they could do it.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; And she did fall. And Adam did walk
[1:09:46] away. She was deceived. He was not.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Is that what Apostle Paul said?
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Are you following me thus far?
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; And so you say,
[1:09:56] how did it how do you know he was? He
[1:09:58] said as as a savior he is because he
[1:10:01] said I have the experience.
[1:10:05] So when he says and I have the
[1:10:06] experience that simply means that what
[1:10:08] God intended in the fall and becoming a
[1:10:12] savior here's a man who's experienced
[1:10:15] it. So now the attribute has been
[1:10:18] appreciated her has been received. How
[1:10:21] many have been saved? Amen.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; We are the beneficiaries of that
[1:10:25] attribute.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; And God, God within himself, there was a
[1:10:30] thrust, there was a force, THERE WAS A
[1:10:31] POWER, AN OUTPOURING. I MUST BE A
[1:10:34] SAVIOR.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; NOT ONLY A FATHER, BUT I MUST BE A
[1:10:38] SAVIOR.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; And the FALLEN HAD TO BECOME ILL, HAD TO
[1:10:43] BECOME SICK, HAD TO HAVE FRAILTIES AND
[1:10:46] COME UNDER THE CURSE. IT HAD TO HAPPEN
[1:10:49] SO THAT HE COULD BE A HEALER. IT HAD TO
[1:10:52] BE BOUND SO HE COULD BE A DELIVERER.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; HAD TO GO INTO DARKNESS SO HE COULD BE
[1:10:56] THE LIGHT THAT WOULD COME.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HAD TO BE CONFUSED SO HE
[1:11:03] COULD COME AND BE THE ANSWER.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; That was all in him.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; It must BE MANIFESTED. IT HAD to be.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; HAD TO BE AT TIMES OF DISTRESS SO HE
[1:11:13] COULD BE THE peace maker.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; OH HALLELUJAH. I FEEL LIKE STOPPING for
[1:11:19] a moment and WORSHIPING HIM. THANK YOU,
[1:11:22] LORD JESUS. HE'S DONE THAT FOR ME. HE'S
[1:11:25] DONE THAT FOR YOU. HE'S COME AND
[1:11:27] MANIFESTED HIS ATTRIBUTE AS A SAVIOR, AS
[1:11:30] THE HEALER. HE'S HEALED YOU. HE'S HEALED
[1:11:33] YOU
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S STILL A HEALER.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; NONE OF THOSE ATTRIBUTES HAVE
[1:11:38] DIMINISHED.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL NOT FIND THE WORD SUBTRACT IN THE
[1:11:43] BIBLE, BUT YOU'LL find the word add. AND
[1:11:46] YOU'LL FIND THE WORD MULTIPLY, BUT
[1:11:47] YOU'LL NEVER FIND THE WORD SUBTRACT.
[1:11:50] GOD, YOU CAN'T TAKE ANYTHING FROM GOD.
[1:11:52] YOU CAN ADD, YOU CAN ADD, you can
[1:11:54] multiply.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; And all of this has happened
[1:12:04] that he might live in his people. He
[1:12:06] went on to say
[1:12:09] he had to experience, he's a savior. He
[1:12:11] had to express that.
[1:12:14] And how could he do it? Only through
[1:12:16] Christ. Notice only through Christ. That
[1:12:21] which went out from him. Only through
[1:12:23] Christ he could be a healer. So it went
[1:12:24] on down to he could be a savior. He
[1:12:27] could be a healer. Only through Christ.
[1:12:30] How could he be a son?
[1:12:32] Only through Christ. That is why it is
[1:12:37] not Jesus.
[1:12:39] It is the Lord Jesus Christ. That is his
[1:12:45] full title.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; ONLY THROUGH CHRIST. HOW could he be a
[1:12:49] healer? Only through Christ. And all
[1:12:52] things wound up, he said, in the person
[1:12:55] Jesus Christ.
[1:12:58] Now, why didn't he keep Adam and Eve
[1:12:59] like that? I go on.
[1:13:02] Why didn't he just keep Adam and Eve
[1:13:04] like that?
[1:13:05] He'd have never been able to express his
[1:13:08] fullness. He would have never been able
[1:13:10] to express his full attribute. And so
[1:13:14] today, we are participants
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; in God's great mystery.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to put that down. I want
[1:13:22] you to remember that I am a participant
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; in the great mystery, the great mystery
[1:13:31] of God.
[1:13:33] We're not just rambling across the face
[1:13:36] of the earth in a just a lot of uh
[1:13:39] irrelevant,
[1:13:41] you know, our lives are not irrelevant.
[1:13:44] But people that just live for this life,
[1:13:46] that's why I say to you, don't get
[1:13:48] caught up with just what's happening
[1:13:50] here.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; This life is irrelevant. Unless you know
[1:13:55] I'm here as an expression of the
[1:13:58] attribute of Almighty God, it'll be a
[1:14:00] mystery. IT MIGHT EVEN BE MYSTERY TO ME.
[1:14:02] BUT THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. I KEEP MY FOCUS
[1:14:04] ON THAT.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; And so today we are participants of the
[1:14:11] great mystery. We are expressing the
[1:14:14] coming of Jesus Christ. Why are we
[1:14:17] expressing the coming? Because this
[1:14:18] happens to be that season.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; First, here was his three purposes.
[1:14:27] First and foremost to express himself
[1:14:31] completely
[1:14:32] God in Christ. Second to have the
[1:14:36] preeminence
[1:14:38] in this in his church which is his body
[1:14:41] bride. And thirdly to restore the
[1:14:44] kingdom to its rightly position that
[1:14:47] fell by sin. Those are the three
[1:14:51] that brother Brandham deals with in
[1:14:52] Christ the mystery God revealed. I'd
[1:14:55] like you to notice please to express the
[1:14:58] preeminence
[1:14:59] to restore all all of these are achieved
[1:15:04] through the anointing that went out from
[1:15:06] God. How could he in the first place?
[1:15:09] How could he express himself? Only
[1:15:11] through Christ.
[1:15:14] How when I say Christ, I don't want you
[1:15:16] to think just of the person of Jesus
[1:15:18] Christ because it went on from there.
[1:15:21] Jesus said himself,
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave you, but yet I won't
[1:15:26] leave you. I will come to you.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; And he came in spirit form
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; so that he could continue on this work
[1:15:33] of what? Expressing the
[1:15:36] un invisible God.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to hold myself back a wee
[1:15:41] bit. So you can just keep yourself alert
[1:15:44] and pray if you would please. So this is
[1:15:46] all achieved through the anointing that
[1:15:49] went out from God. It can only take
[1:15:53] place through Christ. And when I say
[1:15:54] Christ, I want you to think of that
[1:15:56] which came out from God in the
[1:15:57] beginning. The anointing, the logos, the
[1:15:59] light, the son of God, all of that came
[1:16:03] out, that's what's present here. If we
[1:16:05] lose that, if somehow we disconnect
[1:16:08] that, you can never never align yourself
[1:16:11] with God's program. Brother Brandham
[1:16:13] said that's what he was trying to and
[1:16:15] would achieve.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is achieving it.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm preaching today. We're
[1:16:23] going to take a step forward in
[1:16:25] achieving that goal.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if it can be a
[1:16:29] selfrevelation to you, a revelation of
[1:16:31] what God's plan in your life is, then
[1:16:34] that will be a marvelous first step.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And let others see. Don't
[1:16:39] worry about others so much. Let's just
[1:16:41] worry about step number one, I want to
[1:16:43] have a I want to have an understanding
[1:16:46] of what God's program in my life is.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Cuz once that gets in place and gets in
[1:16:51] order and keeps in alignment, not saying
[1:16:53] that you haven't had that or you haven't
[1:16:55] experienced that, but we want to take a
[1:16:57] further step.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; AND IN TAKING A FURTHER STEP, there'll
[1:17:03] be a lot of things that you know that
[1:17:04] get disorganized as we go through a week
[1:17:06] of life.
[1:17:08] Things become priorities that are not
[1:17:11] priorities.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Things become important that really are
[1:17:16] not important.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Things occupy our minds and stress us
[1:17:22] out that aren't worth it.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; They aren't worth it.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Not worth it, friends. Not worth it.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; We get all rattled about things. It's
[1:17:32] not worth it.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; It's not worth it. It's not the focus of
[1:17:37] God. That's why we're here TO GET
[1:17:40] REFOCUSED.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; IT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TO GET THINGS
[1:17:43] REORGANIZED.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; And this is and I would suggest to you,
[1:17:47] we need to get ourselves ALIGNED WITH
[1:17:49] WHAT GOD'S FOCUS IS. GOD'S FOCUS IS this
[1:17:52] force, this anointing THAT WENT OUT.
[1:17:54] THIS ANOINTING, THIS SUN WENT OUT. THIS
[1:17:57] IS WHAT IS IMPORTANT. AND IT WENT OUT
[1:17:59] INTO THE PEOPLE.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; And now YOU HAVE TO SAY, I'VE BEEN A
[1:18:03] RECIPIENT OF THAT SO I CAN BE A
[1:18:05] PARTICIPANT.
[1:18:06] AMEN.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; I've received it.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; I'VE RECEIVED THE WORD.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; I RECEIVE WHAT GOD SENT.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; So God's desire for expression
[1:18:25] is without bounds.
[1:18:28] Some of these phrases which
[1:18:31] I'm giving to you have come from deep
[1:18:33] within. God's desire for expression is
[1:18:38] without bounds.
[1:18:43] To put it in plain English,
[1:18:51] God will
[1:18:53] allow something to take place that you
[1:18:57] and I would write off
[1:19:00] as hopeless.
[1:19:04] And yet God will use it and index it
[1:19:07] around and use it for his glory.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; If we sat beside Apostle Paul and heard
[1:19:14] him say, "I was a blasphemer."
[1:19:18] Say, "What?"
[1:19:20] If I said to you today, "I was a
[1:19:21] blasphemer.
[1:19:23] I was a druggger. I was a drunkard. I
[1:19:27] was an adulterer."
[1:19:29] You'd probably go out of these doors
[1:19:30] saying, "I don't quite have the same
[1:19:33] confidence that I did have
[1:19:36] in brother Biscll."
[1:19:38] That's because you're human.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; And we take it through a human filter.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; And you need to take it through a
[1:19:44] special filter, a supernatural filter.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; God is boundless
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; in his love. He's boundless in his
[1:19:53] forgiveness. HE'S ABSOLUTELY BOUNDLESS
[1:19:56] IN HIS ABILITY TO REDEEM.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; HE'S BOUNDLESS IN THE FORCE FROM WITHIN
[1:20:04] TO EXPRESS HIMSELF. AND IF HE HAS TO LET
[1:20:07] SOMEONE GO TO THE VERY DEPTHS SO THAT HE
[1:20:09] CAN SHOW HIS MERCY,
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; HIS POWER TO REDEEM.
[1:20:15] IF YOU CAN LET SOMEONE NOT ONLY BECOME
[1:20:17] DARKENED WITHIN, BUT LET THEM BECOME TO
[1:20:20] SUCH A HOPELESS THAT THEY'RE NOTHING BUT
[1:20:22] THE DREGS OF HUMANITY AND HE PICKS THEM
[1:20:25] UP AND SETS THEM IN HEAVENLY PLACES IN
[1:20:28] CHRIST JESUS. OH, THE GRACE that drew
[1:20:31] salvation's plan.
[1:20:34] OH, THE LOVE THAT BROUGHT IT DOWN TO
[1:20:36] MAN.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; HOW? Only through Christ.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; ONLY THROUGH CALVARY.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:45] ONLY THROUGH THAT SAITH THE LORD.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; So we want to look at a few God's desire
[1:20:55] for expression
[1:20:58] the image of the invisible God the
[1:21:00] firstborn of every creature. The
[1:21:02] scripture says,
[1:21:04] "For by by for by him were all things
[1:21:07] created that are in heaven and that are
[1:21:09] in the earth, visible and invisible,
[1:21:12] whether they be thrones or domains or
[1:21:14] principalities or powers. All things
[1:21:16] were created by him and for him."
[1:21:21] And the Bible tells us that the Old
[1:21:23] Testament is a a figure.
[1:21:26] In Hebrews it says which was a figure of
[1:21:29] the time then present. There's only a
[1:21:31] figure and the the meaning of the word
[1:21:34] figure is from the word we also
[1:21:37] understand as parable right
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; our word parable comes from that Greek
[1:21:41] word and it's the placing of one thing
[1:21:44] beside another so you can compare it so
[1:21:47] now today we take our lives this
[1:21:50] scenario where you are what you're
[1:21:53] experiencing and we read in the
[1:21:55] scripture in the old testament we read
[1:21:57] about Moses or we read about how God
[1:21:59] dealt with Samuel, how God dealt with
[1:22:01] David and you bring them up and you
[1:22:03] compare them like as a parable and one
[1:22:08] is an example or an example of this one.
[1:22:11] We can see what God honored here. And
[1:22:13] brother Brandham said, if you want to
[1:22:14] know what God will honor today, go back
[1:22:17] and see what he honored if he ever
[1:22:18] honored faith back there. He has to
[1:22:20] honor it today. So you bring them into
[1:22:22] alignment and one compares with the
[1:22:24] other.
[1:22:28] So that is the parable and then apostle
[1:22:30] Paul speaks about it. All these things
[1:22:33] happened in the scripture as an and
[1:22:35] samples that they and they are written
[1:22:38] for our admonition
[1:22:41] upon whom the ends of the world are
[1:22:43] come.
[1:22:45] So the central theme of the whole
[1:22:47] scripture
[1:22:49] is our redemption and restoration
[1:22:52] and of all things to bring all things
[1:22:54] back to its original condition
[1:22:59] when the earth once again will be
[1:23:00] restored back to its Eden beauty.
[1:23:06] And so the scripture which we've read
[1:23:07] over the last three weeks or more to it
[1:23:10] that God God was in Christ and Christ is
[1:23:14] the anointing. So if you say I have
[1:23:17] received the anointing
[1:23:20] this is astounding friends that's to say
[1:23:24] I've received God.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; I have God. Amen.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; I'm only limited by the word that God
[1:23:32] has spoken about me, but I have God in
[1:23:35] me.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; I have the creator in me.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; I have holiness in me.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; The world
[1:23:45] tries to afflict me in the world and
[1:23:49] Satan. And he'll use everything. He'll
[1:23:51] use my job. He'll use my education.
[1:23:54] He'll use my friends. He'll use my
[1:23:56] peers. He uses all of these things, the
[1:23:59] influences of the world. But
[1:24:01] nevertheless,
[1:24:02] one thing is established.
[1:24:05] God in his great driving force to have
[1:24:09] an expression on the earth. I am in
[1:24:11] agreement with the word. I am that
[1:24:14] expression
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; to express him in this place wherever
[1:24:19] you find yourself. That is that is my
[1:24:21] calling on earth. That's why I was born.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; We have wonderful parents, a wonderful
[1:24:29] mother I just spoke of earlier that has
[1:24:31] gone on and many of you children several
[1:24:33] of your children are here.
[1:24:36] The children that issued forth from
[1:24:39] sister Mened, we all have a mother.
[1:24:42] That's how we came.
[1:24:44] You have a mother
[1:24:46] in one sense of the word. I'd like to
[1:24:49] give great honor and respect to that.
[1:24:52] But just for a moment and for the
[1:24:53] purpose of this service and to put
[1:24:56] things in perspective who your mother
[1:24:58] and father are are rather irrelevant.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; They simply what is relevant is that God
[1:25:07] brought you here.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; That's what's relevant.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; When you get those THINGS IN
[1:25:13] PERSPECTIVE, GOD BROUGHT ME HERE.
[1:25:16] FATHER, YOU BROUGHT ME HERE. WHAT WHAT
[1:25:19] DID YOU SEND ME HERE FOR? WHAT AM I TO
[1:25:22] DO? WHAT IS MY PURPOSE IN LIFE? AND HOW
[1:25:26] WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO EXPRESS IT? I HAVE
[1:25:28] BEEN BROUGHT HERE TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF
[1:25:30] YOUR WORD FOR THIS HOUR. SHOW ME WHAT
[1:25:33] THAT WORD IS
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; AND I WILL GIVE MYSELF TO THE EXPRESSION
[1:25:39] OF THAT WORD.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; SHOW ME WHAT YOUR CALL IS. LET ME HEAR
[1:25:42] YOUR voice and you'll hear me answer.
[1:25:46] Send me.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; These are deep things. I'm speaking
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; the subject.
[1:25:59] We are the expression
[1:26:02] of his coming.
[1:26:08] I hope I'm not misunderstood.
[1:26:11] I have questioned
[1:26:16] I've had deep questions about the
[1:26:18] concepts
[1:26:21] and beliefs that many believers and
[1:26:23] especially what Christianity
[1:26:27] holds regarding the second coming of
[1:26:30] Jesus Christ.
[1:26:33] The Jews missed completely
[1:26:38] the first coming
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; and even today are still looking for
[1:26:42] their Messiah
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; and they have gross misconceptions of
[1:26:48] that coming.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; So this
[1:26:55] this is something that you need to think
[1:26:57] about.
[1:27:00] God's elected people,
[1:27:04] God's elected nation,
[1:27:07] who he brought forth from Abraham, the
[1:27:10] father of the faith, and he brought them
[1:27:12] through wars. He gave them a land. He
[1:27:15] brought them through bondages. They went
[1:27:17] into Egypt. They went into Babylon.
[1:27:20] They've had an incredible journey
[1:27:22] through life. And in in our time, THEY
[1:27:25] ALMOST BECAME EXTINCT THROUGH A
[1:27:26] HOLOCAUST. AND THEY'VE HAD AN INCREDIBLE
[1:27:29] HISTORY. AND YET TODAY THEY MISSED THE
[1:27:31] FIRST COMING AND NOW NOW EXPECTING A A
[1:27:34] MESSIAH. AND THEY HAVE RELIGIOUS ORDERS
[1:27:37] BY the score within the country and the
[1:27:40] and beliefs by a myriad OF BELIEFS OF
[1:27:43] WHO THE MESSIAH IS, HOW HE'S GOING TO
[1:27:45] COME AND EVERYTHING ELSE. IT WILL ONLY
[1:27:48] BE BY A DIVINE intervention of God
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; that anyone will see it.
[1:27:55] Amen.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU TALK ABOUT CHRISTIANS, OH,
[1:28:00] THE LORD IS COMING IN POWER AND GREAT
[1:28:02] GLORY. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID WITH
[1:28:05] THE ANGELS AND AND AND what does that
[1:28:07] mean?
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Are there angels coming down out of the
[1:28:13] heavens? Is there clouds that's going to
[1:28:15] come? IS THERE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?
[1:28:20] You're very silent.
[1:28:22] And I expect you to be because when it
[1:28:25] gets right down to where the rubber hits
[1:28:27] the road and for people to actually
[1:28:29] describe how it's going to happen,
[1:28:35] we get
[1:28:39] kind of confused
[1:28:45] and we say the Messiah, the Messiah
[1:28:47] came, CHRIST CAME THE FULLNESS OF THE
[1:28:51] GODHEAD BODILY.
[1:28:53] CAME
[1:28:54] AND THE ELECT OF God
[1:28:59] couldn't recognize him. God
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; in his fullness
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; in HIS UNRESTRICTED POWER,
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; RAISING THE DEAD, healing the sick,
[1:29:10] MIRACLE AFTER MIRACLE ACHIEVED IN FRONT
[1:29:13] OF THE EYES OF THE PEOPLE. I CAN TELL
[1:29:15] YOU WHAT YOU SEE WITH YOUR EYES WON'T
[1:29:17] save you.
[1:29:20] BUT WHAT YOU HEAR WITH THESE EARS WON'T
[1:29:22] GIVE YOU REVELATION.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO PRAY, "OH GOD, WHO SENT ME
[1:29:28] HERE, GOD WHO GAVE ME BIRTH, GOD WHO
[1:29:31] GAVE ME LIFE, GIVE ME THE HOLY SPIRIT."
[1:29:36] AND THE PENTECOSTAL WILL SAY, "HEAR YOU
[1:29:38] SPEAK IN AN UNKNOWN TONGUE SAY, YOU GOT
[1:29:39] IT. YOU GOT IT." BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE
[1:29:41] IT.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S EVIDENCE THEY DON'T HAVE IT.
[1:29:45] AND OTHERS SAY, "WELL, IF YOU CHASE IT,
[1:29:47] EVEN WITHIN THIS MESSAGE, IF YOU FALL
[1:29:49] FORWARD OR FALL BACKWARD OR WHATEVER
[1:29:51] MORE, THAT'S NONSENSE.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; HEAR ME. I SAY IN THE NAME OF THE LORD,
[1:29:55] NONSENSE. IT'S NOT A FEELING, NOT A
[1:29:58] THRILL, NOT A SOMETHING UP YOUR BACK OR
[1:30:00] ANYTHING ELSE.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THAT BECAUSE YOU CRIED, NOT
[1:30:03] BECAUSE YOU SHED TEARS. IT'S BECAUSE
[1:30:06] YOUR LIFE WAS CHANGED.
[1:30:10] IT'S NOT EVEN BECAUSE YOU STOP DRINKING,
[1:30:12] YOU STOP DRUGS, YOU STOP THOSE ARE THE
[1:30:14] ATTRIBUTES OF UNBELIEF. IT'S THAT YOU
[1:30:16] HAVE THE POWER NOW TO BELIEVE THE WORD
[1:30:18] OF GOD.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; AND THAT WORD IN YOU, THAT FAITH IN YOU
[1:30:24] IN THE WORD BEGIN TO TRANSFORM YOU
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; into a new creature in CHRIST JESUS.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; AND ALL THINGS PASS AWAY.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; I'm coming on to ANOTHER MESSAGE
[1:30:37] ALREADY. AND ALL THINGS BECOME NEW.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT THE PERSON YOU USED TO BE.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; IF YOU GOT A TEMPER BACK THEN AND YOU'RE
[1:30:46] IN THE MESSAGE AND YOU STILL HAVE A
[1:30:48] TEMPER, LET ME TELL YOU WHAT YOUR
[1:30:49] MESSENGER SAID.
[1:30:52] Death changes nothing.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; FURTHERMORE, HE SAID, "WHAT YOU ARE
[1:30:59] HERE, YOU WILL BE THERE."
[1:31:02] AND I'LL SAY WHAT YOU ARE HERE, YOU WILL
[1:31:04] BE THERE IN AN INTENSIFIED FORM.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; If you got evil and dark things here, it
[1:31:11] will be intensified there.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; IF YOU LOVE HOLINESS, YOU LOVE THE
[1:31:17] SAINTS.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE SAY, "OH, I'M A BELIEVER, ETC."
[1:31:22] YOU YOUNG MEN, YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU
[1:31:24] HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF FRIENDS, THE
[1:31:26] RIGHT KIND OF FELLOWSHIP. I WOULDN'T
[1:31:28] HANG AROUND WITH THOSE THAT LOVE THE
[1:31:30] WORLD AND THE THINGS OF THE WORLD.
[1:31:32] REMEMBER, DEATH CHANGES NOTHING.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; IF YOU LOVE THAT HERE, YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:31:36] LOVE THE SAME THING ON THE OTHER SIDE.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Remember now, THE PEOPLE OF GOD, THE
[1:31:45] ELECT of God, the children OF GOD IN THE
[1:31:47] OLD TESTAMENT, THEY HAD THEY HAD THE
[1:31:50] MANA, THEY HAD THINGS, BUT THEY WANTED
[1:31:52] FLESH. OH, WE WANT FLESH. WE'RE TIRED OF
[1:31:55] THIS MANA. WE'RE TIRED OF THIS KIND OF
[1:31:58] PREACHING. WE WANT SOMETHING THAT'LL
[1:32:00] THRILL US, SOMETHING THAT'LL DO
[1:32:02] SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR OUR FLESH.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; God be to give them flesh
[1:32:07] till it was just hanging out of their
[1:32:08] mouth and out of their
[1:32:12] He sent them quail and they ate flesh
[1:32:17] till they were so tired of this flesh.
[1:32:20] Said, "No, we don't want this."
[1:32:23] I tell you what, friends, people who
[1:32:26] love the ways of sin and darkness are
[1:32:28] going to go to a place of sin and
[1:32:29] darkness, and it's going to be more like
[1:32:31] the quail. They're going to say, "Oh,
[1:32:34] I'm so fed up. I'm so full of this." But
[1:32:36] they're, the prophet said, they're
[1:32:38] caught and trapped in a nightmare. They
[1:32:42] can't COME BACK TO THIS LIFE BECAUSE
[1:32:44] THEIR TIME IS SPENT UP AND THEY CAN'T GO
[1:32:46] INTO THE PRESENCE OF GOD BECAUSE THEY
[1:32:48] PIERCED WHEN THEY DIED, THEY PIERCED THE
[1:32:51] BLOOD VEIL. AMEN.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; WHERE JESUS WHEN HE DIED FOR THE SINS OF
[1:32:56] THE world while you're in this world,
[1:32:59] the sin is a the blood is ATONING FOR
[1:33:01] YOUR SIN. BUT LISTEN TO ME, MY BROTHER,
[1:33:04] MY SISTER, MY YOUNG FAITHFUL young
[1:33:06] person. WHEN YOU PASS THAT VEIL, THERE
[1:33:09] IS NO MORE BLOOD FOR YOU.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; People actually go to hell.
[1:33:21] Yeah,
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; I know all the preachers put people in
[1:33:24] heaven and that don't be fooled by that.
[1:33:26] They're not in heaven.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; They go to hell.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; And the prophet describes hell.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; You go to a place that's beyond beyond
[1:33:37] redemption. You go to a place, you
[1:33:39] pierce the veil of the blood. The blood
[1:33:41] at this moment is a circle that's around
[1:33:43] the earth.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Let me just give you something.
[1:33:46] Sometimes we think of oh some kind of
[1:33:48] poetic pctoral thing. It's not that. Let
[1:33:51] me get you down to reality. The prophet
[1:33:54] of God said that this word is a bleeding
[1:33:58] word.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; It also is a letter that killth.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; So now we have both sides of it. It's a
[1:34:05] letter that killth. You can just have it
[1:34:07] preached. You can have just a whole
[1:34:08] bunch of uh legal terms to stay and to
[1:34:12] live by, but that'll just kill. That
[1:34:14] doesn't bring life. But it the word in
[1:34:16] its season. The Holy Spirit comes to
[1:34:18] that word in its season. That's why it's
[1:34:20] the word and the spirit.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Out of God came word AND SPIRIT.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN'T HAVE JUST WORD ALONE. YOU
[1:34:28] MUST HAVE WORD AND SPIRIT. And the
[1:34:31] spirit WILL ONLY COME NOT TO HISTORY,
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; NOT TO SOME FUTURE PIE IN THE SKY. THE
[1:34:37] WORD COMES TO THE WORD FOR ITS SEASON.
[1:34:41] AND THE WORD THAT HAS BEEN SENT NOW HAS
[1:34:44] BEEN SENT THROUGH THE MOUTH OF the
[1:34:46] spirit of Elijah.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; MALACHI 4 HAS BEEN FULFILLED AND NOW IS
[1:34:51] IN THE PAST ALREADY IN THE PAST. AND GOD
[1:34:54] HAS SENT A MESSAGE THAT SPIRIT, THE HOLY
[1:34:57] SPIRIT OF GOD THAT CAME OUT of God. THE
[1:35:00] WORD CAME OUT AND THE SPIRIT CAME OUT TO
[1:35:02] MAKE THAT word live.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; And it's that word that changes a
[1:35:08] person's life. That's right.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; There's people that cannot believe and
[1:35:13] do NOT BELIEVE AND DISCREDIT GOD'S word
[1:35:16] in its season.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about hell.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says when they pass from
[1:35:22] this life,
[1:35:26] they pass through the
[1:35:29] blood that actually circles the earth.
[1:35:33] Now, you might think I'm stretching this
[1:35:35] too far, but do you know h I know that
[1:35:39] you believe
[1:35:41] that science has moved along with the
[1:35:43] fulfillment of scripture.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; I know you believe that.
[1:35:48] I'm sure that you believe that the tape
[1:35:51] recorder came on the scene to hold this
[1:35:55] prophet's voice,
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:00] And the word the word of God. I will say
[1:36:04] the thus saith the Lord is the bleeding
[1:36:09] word.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; To receive thus saith the Lord is to
[1:36:15] receive the sacrifice. You might think
[1:36:17] of Calvary. You might believe of Christ
[1:36:18] on the cross. You might go to the movie
[1:36:20] and see the passion which that won't
[1:36:22] give you the picture whatsoever. I have
[1:36:24] not seen it and I do I intend to see it.
[1:36:26] That's not it. If I don't get the story
[1:36:28] from the scripture, I don't have
[1:36:30] anything else move me.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how much my emotions
[1:36:34] get moved. That has nothing to do with
[1:36:36] it. It's how much I get moved by the
[1:36:38] word of God.
[1:36:48] And so it's a bleeding word. That is the
[1:36:51] sacrifice.
[1:36:58] Listen close.
[1:37:00] This is the first time in the history of
[1:37:03] man since Adam.
[1:37:06] While almost all of you in this building
[1:37:09] lived,
[1:37:10] there's the first time
[1:37:13] that the word spoken by God's servant
[1:37:16] can be sent actually into space
[1:37:20] into a dimension that God created to
[1:37:22] hold our voices and encircle the entire
[1:37:26] globe.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; I say it's a banner, a ribbon of blood.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:34] that God in the last day before he
[1:37:38] brings the world to judgment
[1:37:40] he will give them a warning
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; and the warning will not only be by
[1:37:45] spoken word but also scientifically
[1:37:48] vindicated THAT THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING
[1:37:50] IN THAT WORD and I'm thankful TO BE A
[1:37:52] LITTLE PART OF THAT
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; I'M THANKFUL THIS CHURCH CAN BE A PART
[1:37:55] OF THAT I'M THANKFUL THE BRIDE OF JESUS
[1:37:57] CHRIST CAN BE A PART OF THAT SHE IS
[1:37:59] INTERESTED SHE'S A HELP
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; TO HER HUSBAND.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; HER HUSBAND GAVE THE WORD AND SHE SENDS
[1:38:08] IT OUT.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BY VOICE, BY PREACHING, BY
[1:38:13] ANY TECHNOLOGY, BY ANYTHING THAT COMES
[1:38:15] INTO OUR HAND. AND AS OF TODAY, HE IS
[1:38:18] SENDING IT AROUND THE WORLD. THUS SAYITH
[1:38:20] THE LORD, A BLEEDING WORD.
[1:38:25] AMEN.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; And he says, "When you pass that ribbon,
[1:38:31] let me tell every person here that will
[1:38:33] die, cuz some I trust will not die.
[1:38:38] Every person that dies
[1:38:41] is going to do one of two things. You're
[1:38:43] going to pierce that ribbon of blood and
[1:38:47] stand in front of God with no more time
[1:38:51] to live on earth."
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:55] AND STAND THERE WITHOUT A blood to atone
[1:38:59] for you.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; He enlarges on that by saying, "And you
[1:39:05] are locked into a nightmare
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; that you cannot come out of. You're not
[1:39:13] going to wake up
[1:39:16] out of this nightmare.
[1:39:19] My soul is heavy.
[1:39:24] Because I know that I'm speaking to
[1:39:27] those here that are not prepared to go.
[1:39:32] And if somehow your life was called to
[1:39:35] cease at this time, you would pierce the
[1:39:39] blood veil
[1:39:41] and stand before God
[1:39:44] without any time left on this earth.
[1:39:48] Say, how how how old are they when
[1:39:50] they're called?
[1:39:53] Silas was 21.
[1:39:58] I've held him in my arms that have been
[1:40:00] five weeks.
[1:40:03] Innocent went into the presence of God.
[1:40:08] They've gone at young ages. You don't
[1:40:10] have to be old to pass. 32.
[1:40:14] My mother was 32.
[1:40:20] serious indeed
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; and you're going to stand before God and
[1:40:26] you want to don't leave this service
[1:40:28] until you've asked your question. Am I
[1:40:30] prepared for that moment? Because it's a
[1:40:34] fallacy. It's a fallacy of religion
[1:40:36] today to say, "Oh, well, you know, it it
[1:40:38] it will be better." No, no, no. We'll
[1:40:40] come back to the prophet. It will be
[1:40:43] what it is.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; It will be what IT IS.
[1:40:50] OH, THAT MIGHT BE A AN AWAKENING. OH,
[1:40:52] GOD. I I CAN'T GO THE WAY I AM. EVEN
[1:40:55] THOUGH I'M A PROFESSOR, I I READ THE
[1:40:57] MESSAGE. I BELIEVE IT. I I COME HERE TO
[1:40:59] CHURCH. THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
[1:41:01] WHAT KIND OF A LIFE DO YOU HAVE?
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Where are you at with God?
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; You are today.
[1:41:11] And we have calls and people needing so
[1:41:15] much counseling and marital things and
[1:41:20] rearing our children things
[1:41:23] and husband and wife things
[1:41:26] and financial things
[1:41:29] and business things and education things
[1:41:37] in the scale of what I'm speaking about
[1:41:40] those don't even relate.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Those are not even on the page.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about you
[1:41:50] life
[1:41:52] and where you're going.
[1:41:57] This is not here. I'm not here to bring
[1:42:02] any condemnation. There is now therefore
[1:42:05] no condemnation of them are that are in
[1:42:08] in in
[1:42:10] Christ Jesus.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; I do not believe that those things that
[1:42:16] have plagued us.
[1:42:20] You know, when I was a boy, I had a
[1:42:22] temper.
[1:42:25] I don't believe I've ever said that to
[1:42:27] the church.
[1:42:29] When I was a young boy, I had a temper.
[1:42:34] My sister's here in the church this
[1:42:36] morning and I remember once throwing
[1:42:40] something at her in a rage.
[1:42:43] I remember picking up something and I
[1:42:45] was going to strike her maybe when I was
[1:42:47] about just a boy, six, seven, eight and
[1:42:51] say, "Oh, that's just children things."
[1:42:52] Do you know what?
[1:42:55] In my young heart,
[1:42:57] I knew that was wrong.
[1:43:02] I knew that was wrong.
[1:43:04] And when I got into my teens,
[1:43:08] it was always present with me. Not the
[1:43:10] temper. It was present with me that that
[1:43:13] must not be a part of my life.
[1:43:17] That cannot be a part of my life. What
[1:43:20] is just a weakness and a problem with
[1:43:21] the boy, it only grows and intensifies
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; when you get older. And if we have lusts
[1:43:28] of the flesh and we care for the things
[1:43:30] of the flesh, they will only intensify
[1:43:33] as they get older.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; And let me touch on something else here
[1:43:37] that's very striking and very, very
[1:43:39] important. I hear all kinds of
[1:43:41] complaints that come up from time to
[1:43:43] time. Well, I am the way I am because my
[1:43:45] husband is this or I am what I am
[1:43:48] because my wife is this or I am what I
[1:43:50] am. No, no. It's not because it's not
[1:43:53] because of the preacher. It's not
[1:43:54] because of the church. It's not because
[1:43:55] of the deacons and not because your
[1:43:57] wife. The power that God called you to
[1:43:59] be a son or a daughter of God overpowers
[1:44:02] absolutely anything.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; ANYTHING IN THIS LIFE
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS AN EXCUSE.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; SAY AMEN.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; It's an excuse.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; THE POWER THAT GOD BROUGHT AND REDEEMED
[1:44:17] YOU IS SUFFICIENT TO OVERCOME EVERYTHING
[1:44:22] IN THIS LIFE. AND IT MAY BE THAT GOD
[1:44:24] ALLOWED SOMETHING ELSE TO COME YOUR WAY
[1:44:26] TO MAKE YOU STRONGER, TO GIVE YOU MORE
[1:44:28] FAITH, TO MAKE YOUR WALK TO be what it
[1:44:31] ought to be.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; God help me. I never intended to say so.
[1:44:36] I was actually saving those things for
[1:44:39] another service
[1:44:49] that's coming.
[1:44:54] Listen church,
[1:44:56] listen Cloverdale, Bible way and all
[1:44:58] that may be streaming
[1:45:00] as believers of this message.
[1:45:03] We have
[1:45:06] an indescribable responsibility
[1:45:10] to live at a level and live at a
[1:45:12] standard
[1:45:14] that's not the standard of this church.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; We only have one standard. It has to be
[1:45:21] the standard of the scripture.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; And we're not going to try to twist the
[1:45:27] scripture and and contrive it to to make
[1:45:30] it say something it doesn't say. It says
[1:45:32] what it says.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; And if some around you refuse to
[1:45:40] acknowledge it or refuse to obey it or
[1:45:42] refuse to and go A DIFFERENT DIRECTION,
[1:45:44] THAT'S THEIR BUSINESS.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; And they stand before God.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; And people so lightly say, "Oh, I'll
[1:45:50] give answer to God. I'll stand before
[1:45:52] God." Make sure you want to really say
[1:45:54] that.
[1:45:59] And so this, how is Christ coming?
[1:46:03] Do I have a little bit of time?
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; How is he coming?
[1:46:12] Well, he'll come in a way that is
[1:46:13] unexpected. The scripture says it'll be
[1:46:15] like the thief in the night because the
[1:46:17] thief in the night, nobody expected him
[1:46:18] to creep in, but he crept in.
[1:46:24] God didn't make any grand announcement
[1:46:26] to all the dignitaries of Israel when he
[1:46:28] just slipped in and was born in a crib,
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; in a animal crib, in a manger.
[1:46:38] No one expected that.
[1:46:43] Here, here come here, here come now
[1:46:45] follow me closely. Here comes a a a
[1:46:48] messenger and the world becomes
[1:46:51] uh startled
[1:46:53] by the supernatural aspect of it.
[1:46:58] Brother Brandham stands in a certain
[1:47:00] place
[1:47:02] and is holding a child. This not in a
[1:47:04] room. This is not in his house. This is
[1:47:06] not back behind some building. This is
[1:47:08] in front of the people. Hundreds if not
[1:47:11] thousands of them holding a child. All
[1:47:13] crippled up.
[1:47:16] and a little
[1:47:18] sister from a group like the Menanites,
[1:47:21] for example, playing the piano.
[1:47:24] The great physician now is here,
[1:47:27] the sympathizing Jesus.
[1:47:31] And this slight small
[1:47:35] servant of God, softspoken,
[1:47:39] begins to pray over this child. And the
[1:47:42] limbs begin to straighten out and the
[1:47:43] bones begin to snap and crack and the
[1:47:46] people scream. And the girl leaps away
[1:47:49] from the piano playing the great
[1:47:51] physician now is near. And the piano
[1:47:54] continues to play because the atmosphere
[1:47:56] is so sacred it can't be broken.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; And God is breaking something onto the
[1:48:02] scene.
[1:48:05] Now I want to speak about decisions
[1:48:08] because I'm at that point.
[1:48:13] Brother Brandham was having the meeting.
[1:48:16] Maybe a pastor decided or made a
[1:48:19] decision to have that meeting.
[1:48:22] But God
[1:48:24] in his,
[1:48:26] please stay with me closely. God in his
[1:48:29] great
[1:48:33] urge and thrust and driving force to
[1:48:37] bring forth Christ.
[1:48:39] Now the time had come that this will not
[1:48:41] be some historical thing. People keeping
[1:48:43] Christmas and Easter and all that and
[1:48:45] all these religions and all these
[1:48:46] denominations. Now God is going to come
[1:48:49] down and and and and like a knife
[1:48:53] and separate that. God now is going to
[1:48:56] take and bring and introduce Malachi 4.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; I'm going to introduce a forerunner at
[1:49:02] this time. This is going to be
[1:49:04] different. This is not just going to be
[1:49:06] a healing meeting. This is going to be
[1:49:08] different. and the supernatural takes
[1:49:10] place and the people become astounded
[1:49:12] and they startled and shaken and then
[1:49:16] invitations come for more meetings and
[1:49:18] more meetings. Now
[1:49:21] I want to bring it down home to you.
[1:49:24] Brother Brandon made a decision that was
[1:49:27] a human decision
[1:49:29] to go to the Ohio River
[1:49:32] and to baptize some people. And so he's
[1:49:36] just baptizing as we would baptize.
[1:49:39] People go in dry and they come out wet
[1:49:41] and whatever hap transpires within them
[1:49:44] that's between them and God. But then
[1:49:47] now get this. God is on his way to
[1:49:54] intercept
[1:49:55] with a a supernatural act the human the
[1:50:00] human event.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Here's a human event. People are
[1:50:04] gathered and uh ministers baptizing
[1:50:08] people. And this is something everybody
[1:50:10] can understand. But now a voice
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; cries out SAYS, "AS JOHN THE BAPTIST
[1:50:18] FORERRAN THE FIRST COMING OF CHRIST, SO
[1:50:20] WILL YOUR MESSAGE FORUN THE SECOND.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; FORRUN THE SECOND." HEY FOLKS, THINGS
[1:50:26] HAVE CHANGED.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; NOW WE HAVE A MAN IDENTIFIED. NOW WE
[1:50:31] HAVE A VOICE SPEAKING A SUPERNATURAL
[1:50:34] EVENT THAT HAS HAPPENED ON EARTH. AS
[1:50:37] JOHN THE BAPTIST FOREER RAN, SO WILL
[1:50:39] YOUR MINISTRY FORUN THE SECOND COMING OF
[1:50:42] CHRIST. NOW THE WORLD OUGHT TO KNOW AT
[1:50:44] LEAST THE SECOND COMING. THE EVENT IS
[1:50:47] ALREADY IN MOTION.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; The forerunners here.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; IT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED BY A SUPERNATURAL
[1:50:57] EVENT.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:51:00] Notice now I've got some very important
[1:51:02] things to say to your life.
[1:51:06] It wasn't brother Brandham's decision
[1:51:10] to go and baptize
[1:51:12] some people
[1:51:14] that actually brought the voice.
[1:51:17] It was him doing what he would do as a
[1:51:21] minister.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; It was him doing what would be the
[1:51:25] normal thing of life to do. Some people
[1:51:28] asked, "Can you baptize us?" Yes, I will
[1:51:31] baptize you the way we baptize people in
[1:51:34] the name of THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. THAT
[1:51:36] WAS ALL JUST A NORMAL RUN of events. IT
[1:51:40] WAS A NORMAL EVENT. BUT GOD, BECAUSE IN
[1:51:43] HIS ECONOMY, HE HAS OBEDIENT SONS,
[1:51:46] OBEDIENT DAUGHTERS. GOD TAKES A HUMAN
[1:51:49] EVENT AND INTERRUPTS IT WITH A
[1:51:52] SUPERNATURAL EVENT.
[1:51:55] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; I know there's some here that have made
[1:51:59] bad decisions.
[1:52:02] Say, oh, if I could just go and rewrite
[1:52:03] it.
[1:52:05] Let me tell you about a bad decision. A
[1:52:07] prodical son. We call him prodical. The
[1:52:09] Bible doesn't say that.
[1:52:11] But he was a son and he got caught up in
[1:52:16] his desires
[1:52:18] for the world. Oh, I'm going to go. If I
[1:52:22] could get my hands on my share of the
[1:52:24] estate, I'm going to go AND SET THE
[1:52:27] WORLD ON FIRE. I'M GOING TO DO THINGS.
[1:52:30] I'VE BEEN HERE WITH MY FATHER AND MY
[1:52:32] ELDER brother and and this HAS BEEN A
[1:52:34] DRAG. AND I WANT TO GET OUT. I WANT TO
[1:52:36] GET FREE OF MY HOME. I WANT TO GET OUT
[1:52:39] THERE AND DO THINGS AND SET THE WORLD ON
[1:52:41] FIRE. I I'M JUST GETTING MY SHARE OF THE
[1:52:43] ESTATE. FATHER,
[1:52:47] would you please give me my inheritance?
[1:52:52] And the father gave him all of his
[1:52:54] inheritance that he had coming.
[1:52:58] But he had friends and he went into
[1:53:01] another country. He went into a strange
[1:53:03] place. He went down, who knows where it
[1:53:06] was, into Seattle or Las Vegas or some
[1:53:10] place. And I'm going, he made a
[1:53:12] decision. I'm going down. Am I going to
[1:53:15] live a life? Wow. Are you with me?
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; That was a his decision.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; And he
[1:53:23] uh invested or wasted. Wasted is a
[1:53:27] better word.
[1:53:28] And he wasted. It's a strange thing with
[1:53:31] your inheritance. It's like ether.
[1:53:35] Any of you folks know what ether is?
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Ether evaporates.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Just goes. you have it in your bank
[1:53:42] account. And
[1:53:44] wow, I had a few thousand dollars there.
[1:53:49] I better get off that subject.
[1:53:52] But it's like ether. Believe me, it's
[1:53:54] like ether.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; You get some money in your hand, you get
[1:53:57] some money in your bank account. It's
[1:53:59] like ether.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; And it just goes, it just takes wings
[1:54:04] and flies.
[1:54:06] And he found he had nothing.
[1:54:10] and he's eating from the drakes of the
[1:54:13] swine where he was feeding.
[1:54:15] That was his decision.
[1:54:18] It was a series of decisions.
[1:54:21] It was a bad decision. Many bad
[1:54:23] decisions.
[1:54:28] Then one day
[1:54:32] he came to himself.
[1:54:36] He had lots of time to come to himself.
[1:54:37] He thought about this a lot of time. But
[1:54:39] now he came to himself AND IN COMING TO
[1:54:42] HIMSELF THAT WAS GOD'S SUPERNATURAL
[1:54:45] INTERVENTION IN HIS EVENT.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; HIS EVENT WAS THE RESULT OF HIS BAD
[1:54:49] DECISIONS. YOU MAY BE WHERE YOU ARE
[1:54:51] TODAY AND SAID, "OH, IF I COULD JUST GO
[1:54:53] BACK AND REDO THIS OR UNDO THAT OR DO
[1:54:55] SOMETHING ELSE." I WILL TELL YOU TWO
[1:54:57] THINGS. NUMBER ONE, YOU CAN'T DO THAT,
[1:54:59] BUT DON'T DO IT AGAIN.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST, BUT YOU CAN
[1:55:04] CHANGE THE FUTURE BY ALLOWING HIM TO
[1:55:07] INTERRUPT. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
[1:55:10] ELSE. YOU MAY BE SOMEBODY YOU'RE PRAYING
[1:55:11] FOR AND THEY'VE MADE SOME BAD DECISIONS,
[1:55:14] BUT GOD CAN INTERRUPT THEM.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; GOD CAN BRING THEM BACK TO THEIR SENSES.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; GOD CAN CAUSE THEM CAUSE THEM TO COME TO
[1:55:22] THEMSEL.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS A SUPERNATURAL EVENT IN A
[1:55:26] VERY NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; And he came to himself
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; and he really could think right for the
[1:55:34] first time. I will go back to my father.
[1:55:37] He began to think things. There's many
[1:55:39] servants of my father better off than I
[1:55:41] am. I'm going to go back to my father.
[1:55:43] THAT WAS A SUPERNATURAL EVENT. HIS MIND
[1:55:46] BECAME ILLUMINATED.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; And he returned to his father and become
[1:55:54] part of the scripture, become part of
[1:55:55] the word.
[1:55:58] Remember this please.
[1:56:01] A bad decision
[1:56:03] will not prevent
[1:56:05] the sovereign grace of God from bringing
[1:56:09] a son or daughter to himself.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Neither will a right decision
[1:56:18] necessarily
[1:56:21] cause
[1:56:23] the supernatural event, the supernatural
[1:56:27] interruption of God. It's not because we
[1:56:29] do we do a whole lot of nice things that
[1:56:32] God says, "Oh, you know, now I'm going
[1:56:35] to do it." No, it's his grace.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; It is his so sovereign grace.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; So what is the benefit of a good
[1:56:43] decision over a bad decision, a bad
[1:56:45] decision, lost years, lost fellowship,
[1:56:48] wounds, bounds, ALL KINDS OF FEATHERS,
[1:56:52] PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL SCARS, ALL KINDS OF
[1:56:55] THINGS THAT IS THROUGH BAD DECISIONS.
[1:56:57] BUT A GOOD DECISION, NEITHER DOES A GOOD
[1:57:00] DECISION, ALL A GOOD DECISION DOES IS
[1:57:02] PREVENTS A LOT OF THAT.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; You that ARE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
[1:57:06] BROUGHT UP IN THE MESSAGE. WHAT A WHAT A
[1:57:08] PRIVILEGE YOU have
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; so YOU'RE NOT ALL TANGLED UP WITH the
[1:57:12] things of the world
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; and and I would keep a series of good
[1:57:15] decisions.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Can I have just a few more minutes,
[1:57:25] please?
[1:57:37] Now
[1:57:38] because I was speaking on at the
[1:57:40] expression of the coming of Christ
[1:57:45] and what should be our decision? What
[1:57:47] should be your decision this morning?
[1:57:50] Well, maybe I'll say a couple more
[1:57:52] things that will help you
[1:57:55] because these things I think are really
[1:57:56] striking. And I know that I've said some
[1:57:58] things that are perhaps a little bit
[1:57:59] startling to you.
[1:58:03] You know, Brother Brandham talks about
[1:58:05] the coming of Christ and Jesus said it
[1:58:09] come as a thief in the night and so on.
[1:58:12] And I related brother Bram's decision to
[1:58:15] baptize and then the supernatural
[1:58:18] intervention.
[1:58:20] Now what? Now where do we go from here?
[1:58:24] You know when when a prophet preaches
[1:58:27] souls that are in prison,
[1:58:31] it it is frightening. There are times
[1:58:33] it's frightening. He said that they were
[1:58:36] preached to souls that were in prison.
[1:58:37] It was already too late.
[1:58:43] I have to tell you what's on my heart.
[1:58:46] In many cases, I believe we're already
[1:58:48] there.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says door in a door.
[1:58:55] Listen now is Malachi 4 speaking.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; It's not Ed Biscll.
[1:59:02] What if today the rapture came
[1:59:06] and he took two from Tucson,
[1:59:09] one from Phoenix, and around the world
[1:59:12] as a universal rapture will be. And the
[1:59:16] ones that rises from the dead will go to
[1:59:19] meet him in the air. Those that rise
[1:59:21] from the dead, outside of the sovereign
[1:59:23] grace of God, you won't know anything
[1:59:24] about that.
[1:59:27] only if God allowed you to meet one that
[1:59:31] had risen from the dead.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; We will go and we'll be gathered with
[1:59:36] them and meet the Lord in the air. The
[1:59:38] scripture says
[1:59:41] but he says this, you meet him in the
[1:59:44] air and steal away
[1:59:47] a mysterious thing.
[1:59:50] And then one of these days judgment
[1:59:52] drops upon the earth. And you say,
[1:59:56] do you hear what I'm saying?
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Judgment will drop upon the earth. And
[2:00:00] there'll be very religious people. And I
[2:00:02] will say people who professed to follow
[2:00:04] this message. And they will say, he's
[2:00:07] telling you in advance what they will
[2:00:09] say. And this is what they will say.
[2:00:11] Well, wasn't there supposed to be a
[2:00:13] rapture first?
[2:00:16] True.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; And you knew it not.
[2:00:20] Think how many people will disappear in
[2:00:22] the world today and there won't even be
[2:00:26] a word.
[2:00:29] You'll know nothing about it. There'll
[2:00:31] be 500 people in the world today will
[2:00:33] come up missing
[2:00:35] and you won't know nothing about it.
[2:00:38] We're living in a terrific time.
[2:00:41] Now,
[2:00:43] the religious world has made you to
[2:00:45] think there's going to be thunders and
[2:00:49] thunderous and lightning and flashes and
[2:00:52] clouds and great power and glory and the
[2:00:56] Lord's going to descend. I say that's a
[2:00:57] fallacy.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; It's going to happen, but it's not going
[2:01:01] to happen. What we've done is taken the
[2:01:03] scripture and we put our interpretation
[2:01:05] to it
[2:01:07] and we've making the the Gentiles have
[2:01:09] made exactly the same error that the
[2:01:12] Jews made and they've missed him.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; And the Gentiles have had their
[2:01:16] religious concepts and have missed him.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; And remember
[2:01:22] now remember I'm coming to the crux of
[2:01:24] my message. Been preaching for an hour
[2:01:26] and a half and I'm really at the crux of
[2:01:28] it now. This is where I should start.
[2:01:30] But you needed this.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said to Peter and the
[2:01:38] disciples,
[2:01:40] "Who do you say I am?"
[2:01:44] It wasn't just that they were
[2:01:45] identifying Jesus Christ, but in the
[2:01:47] concept and and in the context of my
[2:01:50] message today, what they were really
[2:01:52] saying is, "We believe you've come."
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; We believe you're actually here. Right?
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; We believe the Messiah has arrived.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; The reason why the prophet of God went
[2:02:06] over that and over that and over that
[2:02:08] and said to the church and said to THE
[2:02:10] PEOPLE, "WHO DO YOU SAY THIS IS?"
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; HE WANTED THEM TO WAKE UP
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS CHRIST HERE NOW,
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; NOT SOMEBODY COMING, SOMEBODY WHO HAD
[2:02:23] ARRIVED.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ME, IT'S HIM. HE SAID, AMEN.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; It's him. It's not me. It's him.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; AND NOW GOD HAS A MESSENGER IN THE
[2:02:36] PHYSICAL BODY OF FLESH TO INTRODUCE ONE
[2:02:39] WHO'S BEYOND THE VEIL. JUST AN EYESIGHT
[2:02:41] JUST OUT OF YOUR EYESIGHT, JUST OUT OF
[2:02:43] THE TOUCH OF THESE UH NATURAL UH UH UH
[2:02:47] PHYSICAL SENSES, BUT HE WAS PRESENT. AND
[2:02:50] THEN THE SPIRIT OF THAT WORD CAME INTO
[2:02:54] THE DISCIPLES. AND THAT IS WHY JESUS
[2:02:55] SAID, "DON'T GO PREACHING. GO TO
[2:02:58] JERUSALEM.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; AND NOW I TALK ABOUT THE DECISION THAT
[2:03:02] 120 MADE AND THE DECISION THAT 380 made
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; because he WAS SEEN OF ABOVE 500
[2:03:08] BRETHREN AND 120 GOT TO WHERE CHRIST
[2:03:11] TOLD THEM TO GO AND 380 DIDN'T ARRIVE.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; So they made a decision
[2:03:21] to go and they're sitting there a day
[2:03:26] 120. Do you know what's amazing about
[2:03:28] that?
[2:03:30] 120 went there. Day one,
[2:03:34] there's still 120. Day two, still 120.
[2:03:39] DAY FOUR, DAY FIVE, STILL 120. OH, I
[2:03:43] THANK GOD THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T
[2:03:45] PREPARED TO GO THEIR OWN WAY OR DO
[2:03:47] ANYTHING DIFFERENT. AND AND FINALLY, DAY
[2:03:50] 10, STILL 120.
[2:03:54] I TRUST THAT'S THE KIND OF PEOPLE WE GOT
[2:03:56] HERE TODAY.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; STILL 120.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; I'M STILL HERE.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M STILL HERE.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; I'M STILL ENERGIZED BY THIS WORD. I'M
[2:04:09] STILL HERE.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; I'VE COME THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES. THEY
[2:04:14] DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THEIR FINANCES. THEY
[2:04:16] DIDN'T TALK ABOUT ALL THAT NONSENSE.
[2:04:18] THEY WERE STILL THERE WAITING.
[2:04:24] FOR HIM WHO HAD BEEN HERE, CHRIST AND
[2:04:28] HAD GONE WAS GOING TO SEND NOW THE
[2:04:30] SPIRIT TO GIVE LIFE TO HIS WORDS.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE LOGOS THAT WAS SPEAKING.
[2:04:35] AND NOW THEY NEEDED TO RECEIVE THE
[2:04:37] SPIRIT INTERNALLY SO THEY COULD
[2:04:40] INTERNALIZE HIS WORDS AND RECEIVE THE
[2:04:43] POWER THEY NEEDED TO CONTINUE THE
[2:04:46] EXPRESSION OF GOD THROUGH CHRIST.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:04:52] And now their message had changed.
[2:04:57] This Christ
[2:04:59] who you saw
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; and who you heard
[2:05:04] did God send
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; and he was proven by many many
[2:05:09] supernatural things. And you with wicked
[2:05:12] hands HAVE TAKEN AND CRUCIFIED HIM. AND
[2:05:14] NOW THEIR MESSAGE WAS HE WAS PROMISED.
[2:05:17] HE CAME AND YOU MISSED IT.
[2:05:22] RIGHT.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; And while you wait for a rapture,
[2:05:27] friends,
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; you're going to find yourself actually
[2:05:31] on the other side. You're not going to
[2:05:34] have any anticipation.
[2:05:36] I don't believe you'll have any
[2:05:37] anticipation. It's just a faith you hold
[2:05:39] in your heart. You're just going to
[2:05:41] believe it. And one day, he said death
[2:05:43] doesn't change anything. I say the
[2:05:44] rapture doesn't change doesn't change
[2:05:46] anything except the change of your body.
[2:05:48] And you're going to find yourself on the
[2:05:49] other side. Say, "My goodness, I took
[2:05:52] one step and now look where I'm at."
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M BEYOND DEATH. IT'S GONE.
[2:05:59] THERE'S NO MEMORY OF IT. IT'S GONE.
[2:06:01] WE'RE IN A NEW LIFE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE
[2:06:03] THE WORD.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; And maybe some sitting right in this
[2:06:10] congregation this morning are going to
[2:06:12] be in the other part of the prophet's
[2:06:13] words going to say, "Wow,
[2:06:17] wasn't it supposed to be a rapture
[2:06:18] first?"
[2:06:20] He said, "Look at the things that's
[2:06:21] happening."
[2:06:23] You know, when I see the judgments
[2:06:25] already falling,
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; sometimes I sit on a plane.
[2:06:33] I looked at a newspaper
[2:06:37] and I think to myself,
[2:06:41] looks like the tribulation's already set
[2:06:43] in.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; What am I doing here?
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; What am I doing here?
[2:06:50] Friends,
[2:06:51] precious friends,
[2:06:54] don't be caught in such a place after
[2:06:57] I'm preaching my heart out. Don't let
[2:07:00] these things in this world prevent you,
[2:07:03] hinder you, thwart your direction. Keep
[2:07:07] your focus, keep your direction, and let
[2:07:10] everything else fall where it may, BUT
[2:07:12] KEEP YOUR EYES UPON THE GOAL, the his
[2:07:16] achievement. And so, what are we doing
[2:07:18] here today? That's why this church is
[2:07:20] not like other churches.
[2:07:25] Friends,
[2:07:27] I'm really speaking from my heart and
[2:07:28] I'm probably going to be understood.
[2:07:31] It's not your long skirt, sisters,
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; and it's not your long hair.
[2:07:39] There may be some that see that.
[2:07:42] Many see that. And it just has a big
[2:07:46] zero effect.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; You're an odd bunch. Oh, that church on
[2:07:52] the hill or whatever more. Oh, yeah. We
[2:07:55] got a bunch of men in Linda and oh
[2:07:57] that's fine
[2:07:59] but your life
[2:08:03] your manner.
[2:08:10] You are
[2:08:12] different by the transforming power.
[2:08:15] You're actually different.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; It's difference in your appearance. It's
[2:08:19] difference. There's a difference. And
[2:08:21] you know what it is? There's an aura.
[2:08:24] around you.
[2:08:30] You young people, you children,
[2:08:33] you families,
[2:08:36] you're different.
[2:08:39] Not just because you dress different or
[2:08:42] look different, but there's an aura
[2:08:45] of power. There's an aura of holiness.
[2:08:50] There's an aura. There's something
[2:08:51] around you and people recognize it. They
[2:08:55] know it. They know it. It's not me
[2:08:58] telling you that. I don't need to pump
[2:09:00] you up. You either got it or you haven't
[2:09:02] got it.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Joe Perkins, excuse me for
[2:09:09] making a personal
[2:09:11] reference.
[2:09:14] Brother Joe Perkins is
[2:09:17] a believer
[2:09:19] and so I only use him as an example.
[2:09:24] Yesterday
[2:09:25] you know we're having a a wonderful time
[2:09:28] of fellowship. It's not like a religious
[2:09:31] service.
[2:09:34] And my wife had noticed
[2:09:36] brother Perkins standing by himself over
[2:09:39] on the on the deck out at the camp, just
[2:09:44] standing there alone. I don't know what
[2:09:46] was in his mind or in his thoughts.
[2:09:50] And my daughter Linda wanted to say
[2:09:52] something to her mother.
[2:09:56] My mother, my my
[2:09:59] Linda's mother, my wife is
[2:10:02] not real stable on her feet with a
[2:10:04] little
[2:10:06] uh
[2:10:08] I won't say disability, but she's just
[2:10:11] not as stable as she would like to be.
[2:10:15] So, Linda walked over and she wanted to
[2:10:17] say something to her. She walked over
[2:10:19] and took her hand and she came up on the
[2:10:21] deck and they just started in their
[2:10:23] conversation together as mother and
[2:10:25] daughter.
[2:10:30] And brother Perkins,
[2:10:33] this spoke to my wife.
[2:10:36] You walked over
[2:10:40] said, "Excuse me, I don't know what
[2:10:43] you're talking about. Excuse me for
[2:10:45] interrupting.
[2:10:48] But he said, "Just the way that you did
[2:10:51] that
[2:10:52] and you reach out daughter to mother
[2:10:56] and received her up and helped her." He
[2:10:58] said, "That was just such a display of
[2:11:02] respect.
[2:11:05] It so spoke to him."
[2:11:07] Brother Perkins, excuse me for making
[2:11:09] this personal reference. As a believer,
[2:11:13] you know, you expect that believers
[2:11:14] might pick up on that, but you know,
[2:11:16] there are people in the world and they
[2:11:18] notice these little insignificant
[2:11:22] things.
[2:11:24] Just how you responded,
[2:11:27] how you answered,
[2:11:30] how you didn't respond
[2:11:33] when the world would have responded,
[2:11:36] what it was you said.
[2:11:40] and they're seeing something different.
[2:11:42] There's good people. I'm not talking
[2:11:44] about good people now. There's very good
[2:11:46] people in the world.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about people that have been
[2:11:50] shaped. Watch now. I'm closing. People
[2:11:53] actually been formed
[2:11:56] by a word. It didn't come from William
[2:11:59] Brham. He was only a mouthpiece,
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; but it actually came from the outpouring
[2:12:04] of God,
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; the force of God.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. through a vessel out into the
[2:12:10] sound waves and into the ears of people
[2:12:14] and it begin to shape and transform
[2:12:16] their life till they can say I'm not
[2:12:19] what I used to be. I'm not the person I
[2:12:21] used to be. Not because the church said
[2:12:23] don't smoke, don't drink, DON'T TAKE
[2:12:25] DRUGS. HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. IT'S
[2:12:27] AN INTERNAL WORK
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[2:12:32] SOMEBODY MIGHT BE HERE TODAY AND SAID,
[2:12:34] "WELL, I DECIDED TO COME TO CHURCH." BUT
[2:12:37] YOU KNOW WHAT? IT MIGHT WELL BE THAT GOD
[2:12:39] IS USING THIS VESSEL TO INTERRUPT YOUR
[2:12:42] EVENT WITH A SUPERNATURAL ACT AND TELL
[2:12:45] YOU NOW IS YOUR MOMENT. NOW IS YOUR
[2:12:48] TIME.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; IT MAY BE NOT BECAUSE NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE
[2:12:55] AT A A SWINE TROUGH. IT MAY BE WHILE
[2:12:58] YOU'RE SITTING IN THIS SEAT THAT GOD
[2:13:01] SAYS AND AWAKENS YOU.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Till you can get your right thinking,
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; your right thought.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stop in a few minutes, but
[2:13:15] I can't stop yet. There are the things
[2:13:17] that have been little irritants,
[2:13:21] and they're more than little irritants.
[2:13:22] They're big irritants. I'm going to
[2:13:25] speak about how your home is conducted.
[2:13:27] how you as mothers watch over your home
[2:13:30] and conduct your home and you as
[2:13:32] husbands as providers and spiritual men
[2:13:36] in the church in your home as priests
[2:13:40] I'm going to say that if there's a
[2:13:41] relationship husband wife relationship
[2:13:44] in this world at the very best of times
[2:13:46] it's not easy but I will tell you on the
[2:13:50] authority of God's word there's power in
[2:13:52] this spoken word to make a marriage what
[2:13:55] it ought to be to make a home WHAT IT
[2:13:58] OUGHT TO BE.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; NOT SAYING THAT DISAPPOINTMENTS WON'T
[2:14:05] COME. NOT SAYING THAT THERE WON'T BE
[2:14:07] SATAN come roaring in like a lion and
[2:14:10] tear a tear at a home or a family. But
[2:14:13] the one THAT HAS THEIR SIGHT AND THEIR
[2:14:15] GOAL FIXED ON CHRIST THAT THAT PERSON
[2:14:19] CANNOT BE DEFEATED
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES CANNOT BE
[2:14:24] DEFEATED.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:28] IT'S OF A CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TODAY that
[2:14:31] a husband
[2:14:33] set THE EXAMPLE
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; AND HAVE A LEADERSHIP IN HIS HOME AND
[2:14:38] SPIRITUAL LEADERSHIP NOT BY WORD BUT BY
[2:14:42] EXAMPLE
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; TO LIVE THE LIFE
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; THAT THE CHILDREN CAN ADORE
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; AND LIVE THE LIFE THE CHILD MIGHT GO
[2:14:53] SIDEWAYS BUT THEY CAN LOOK BACK AND HEY,
[2:14:56] DAD DID IT RIGHT.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; MOTHER DID IT RIGHT. THEY GAVE AN
[2:15:00] EXAMPLE AND GOD WILL HOLD THAT BEFORE
[2:15:03] THEM
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; and they will have the enlightenment.
[2:15:06] LOOK AT WHEN THE YOUNG MAN'S LIFE AT THE
[2:15:09] AT THE SWINE PIT WHEN HE CAME TO
[2:15:11] HIMSELF. WHAT DID HE THINK ABOUT?
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID HE THINK ABOUT HOW HIS FATHER
[2:15:18] TREATED HIS SERVANTS? AMEN.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT, OH, THE GOOD TIME
[2:15:26] I CAN HAVE AT HOME AND MY DAD AND THE
[2:15:28] KIND OF PERSON he is AND MY MOM AND WHAT
[2:15:31] SHE DOES FOR ME AND WASHES MY CLOTHES
[2:15:33] AND HERE I AM IN THIS PIT. THAT'S NOT
[2:15:35] THE POINT. IF YOU RETURN BECAUSE OF
[2:15:38] THAT, THE CHURCH IS NICE. THERE'S A GIRL
[2:15:40] THERE I LIKE. THERE'S A BOY THERE I
[2:15:42] LIKE. THAT'S NONSENSE.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; LET GOD GUIDE YOUR LIFE.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; the father
[2:15:52] be the provider and take his place in
[2:15:57] the home and a mother take her place in
[2:15:59] the home and be a mother. And let me say
[2:16:03] this to you, there are parameters
[2:16:07] for a husband and parameters for the
[2:16:10] wife.
[2:16:12] And where a lot of the trouble comes is
[2:16:15] when the wife or the husband began to
[2:16:18] cross over and actually invade the
[2:16:21] parameters, the responsibilities of the
[2:16:24] other. And that's what we don't want to
[2:16:27] do. And what is our life expressing? I
[2:16:30] want to say to you as a congregation as
[2:16:31] I close now and to those that are
[2:16:34] streaming,
[2:16:36] you are an expression
[2:16:38] of the coming of Christ.
[2:16:41] And when the spirit of the word that
[2:16:44] came from the mouth of Jesus Christ came
[2:16:47] into the disciples, they had to express
[2:16:49] before the world, he has already come.
[2:16:54] He's already left and we happen to be
[2:16:56] here to tell you you missed him.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; Don't add to my words. But I will say
[2:17:03] this, we are an expression.
[2:17:07] I don't know how many more God will
[2:17:08] bring.
[2:17:14] Do you know that in the days of Wesley,
[2:17:15] he would stand on a chair and have about
[2:17:18] 20,000 people and preach the simple
[2:17:21] gospel? I have Wesley's messages in my
[2:17:24] volumes and there would be thousands
[2:17:29] that would come to Christ. And today you
[2:17:33] can exert, you can lay before God, you
[2:17:37] can exert every energy. The people can
[2:17:40] pray and we do everything possible and
[2:17:43] you can exert all of this energy and
[2:17:45] sometimes one or two will come.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; That's true, friends.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT EASIER.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; IT'S HARDER.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; And there will BE A TIME I'VE SAID IT
[2:17:59] BEFORE. I'LL SAY IT ONE MORE TIME.
[2:18:01] THERE'LL BE A TIME WHEN EVERY SERMON
[2:18:03] THAT'S BEEN PREACHED BY EVERY MEMBER OF
[2:18:05] THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST, EVERY LIFE
[2:18:07] THAT'S BEEN LIVED, EVERY WITNESS THAT'S
[2:18:09] BEEN GIVEN, EVERY DOLLAR THAT'S BEEN
[2:18:11] SPENT WILL BE SPENT FOR ONE SOUL CALLED
[2:18:15] THE LAST ONE.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET SAID THERE WILL BE THE
[2:18:19] LAST ONE. AND WHEN THE LAST ONE COMES
[2:18:22] IN, WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; WE'RE HISTORY.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; You might be here
[2:18:33] this morning.
[2:18:36] That's just where we're at.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; And we are not the expression of a
[2:18:40] church.
[2:18:42] We are not the expression. That's why we
[2:18:43] don't act as a church. People people
[2:18:45] come to us all the time from the world
[2:18:47] and around say, "Well, you're a nice
[2:18:49] church and this. We want to be part of
[2:18:50] the school. We want to be part of this.
[2:18:52] We want to be part of that." We shut it
[2:18:54] down. That's not our call. OUR CALL IS
[2:18:58] TO EXPRESS A MESSAGE THAT HAS COME FROM
[2:19:01] GOD AND IT WILL BE INTERNALIZED IN THE
[2:19:04] PEOPLE AND YOU CHILDREN WILL BE GROWN UP
[2:19:06] WITH IT. IT WILL CHANGE AND TRANSFORM
[2:19:09] YOUR LIFE AS YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE THROUGH
[2:19:11] AND YOU WILL EXPRESS THE WORD FOR THE
[2:19:12] SEASON BECAUSE YOU CANNOT EXPRESS
[2:19:14] ANYTHING ELSE. AND THE WORD FOR THE
[2:19:16] SEASON IS MALACHI 4 HAS ALREADY
[2:19:18] HAPPENED.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; LUKE 17:30 HAS ALREADY BEEN MANIFESTED.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; AND REVEALED TO SOME AND NOT REVEALED TO
[2:19:26] A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; AND SOME HAVE RECEIVED THE WORD BUT HAVE
[2:19:30] NOT ALLOWED IT YET FIRST PLACE IN THEIR
[2:19:32] LIFE. AND YOU need to do that. AND
[2:19:34] YOU'RE SITTING HERE TODAY. YOU'RE
[2:19:36] BELIEVERS HERE TODAY. AND YOU NEED TO
[2:19:37] LET THAT HAVE FIRST PLACE IN YOUR LIFE.
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; AND you need to realize your call
[2:19:44] in this generation is to be an
[2:19:46] expression
[2:19:48] of his coming.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; I'm expressing that he came.
[2:19:53] What happens now, brother Biscll? Well,
[2:19:56] I can tell you what's going to happen,
[2:19:57] but I can't tell you how it's going to
[2:19:58] happen.
[2:20:02] There's going to be some folks not going
[2:20:04] to be found around.
[2:20:11] And as of this morning,
[2:20:15] there's probably young people
[2:20:18] and married couples
[2:20:20] that might be missing family members.
[2:20:24] That's God's word.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; They're simply going to be gone.
[2:20:30] Says, "I'll take them."
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; And the other scripture says, "And
[2:20:34] they'll be left.
[2:20:42] And that's what I leave you with this
[2:20:44] morning.
[2:20:45] Cloverdale Bible way
[2:20:48] as believers.
[2:20:50] That is why we have no interest in the
[2:20:52] world to say, "Well, this church is
[2:20:53] doing that and this church allows that
[2:20:55] and this church,
[2:20:57] I'm not even interested."
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; And when you people sometimes give me a
[2:21:04] call and say, "Well, I need this, I need
[2:21:05] that, I need you to call me right away."
[2:21:07] and I don't call right away because I
[2:21:09] have another priority
[2:21:13] that much supersedes
[2:21:16] your perceived big problem which in my
[2:21:19] estimation is rather a little problem.
[2:21:23] I asked brother Dioa a few days ago,
[2:21:26] brother Dioa,
[2:21:28] you have thousands of people.
[2:21:31] We try to answer all of our people's
[2:21:33] requests and call and brother Tom and
[2:21:36] other ministers, brother John and we try
[2:21:39] to answer their requests. We try to meet
[2:21:42] I try to answer all my emails.
[2:21:45] I answered one first thing this morning
[2:21:47] before finishing the little message
[2:21:49] because a brother had asked me it was a
[2:21:52] false doctrine. He asked me do you
[2:21:54] believe that? No, I said somebody from
[2:21:56] the Eastern Canada is teaching this. I
[2:21:58] said brother Brandham never said it. The
[2:22:00] scripture never said it. I have never
[2:22:01] said it. I have never believed it. He
[2:22:03] wanted to know, do you have that
[2:22:04] revelation? No, I have that. And it's
[2:22:06] not a revelation. It's a human thought.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; The prophet never spoke. Never once. The
[2:22:11] Bible never says it once. I have never
[2:22:13] seen it anywhere. And I'm not prepared
[2:22:15] to take somebody's concoction.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; But we've tried to answer everybody. I
[2:22:23] said to brother Dioa, "How do you handle
[2:22:25] this?"
[2:22:28] Well, he said,
[2:22:30] "I tell them to go home and pray."
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:22:38] I said to brother Tom, I got a wonderful
[2:22:40] answer from Brother Doca.
[2:22:43] When people come with all kinds of
[2:22:44] financial problems and marital problems
[2:22:46] and everything else and all these kind
[2:22:48] of problems, he tells them, "Go home
[2:22:51] first and pray. Go to the prayer meeting
[2:22:54] and pray."
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; And that's what I say to the
[2:22:57] congregation. And that's what we need to
[2:22:58] do so we can have our priorities right.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[2:23:04] Expression of the coming, second coming
[2:23:07] of Jesus Christ.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; And you might go home a little nervous
[2:23:10] today. Say, "Where are we?" I wouldn't
[2:23:13] worry about it. Just as long as you've
[2:23:15] been able to identify, let me ask every
[2:23:18] single person. Answer yourself. Who do
[2:23:20] you say this is?
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; Well, it's a sermon. It's a nice man.
[2:23:28] It's a good church. That's what Brother
[2:23:30] Brandham says. All the denominational
[2:23:32] said,
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; That's what they said. Brother Ernie,
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; it's a good church. He was a good
[2:23:37] teacher. He's a nice man. Brother Bis is
[2:23:39] a nice fellow. You don't take everything
[2:23:40] he says, but you know, and the people
[2:23:42] there, they're nice people, etc., etc.
[2:23:45] You're you're just denominational.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; That's where you're at. You're just a
[2:23:49] denomination.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; But who do you say this word is? Well,
[2:23:53] you know, there's I've heard some
[2:23:55] powerful messages come out of the out of
[2:23:56] the message and and it sits on my shelf,
[2:23:59] etc., etc. Who do you say it is?
[2:24:03] Oh, I have Christ on my shelf gathering
[2:24:05] dust.
[2:24:08] I have Christ expressed himself on dis.
[2:24:12] I never hear it.
[2:24:15] Excuse me.
[2:24:17] Something don't add up.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; Something don't add up.
[2:24:26] As of this moment, you're lost.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; As of this moment, you're still lost.
[2:24:34] You haven't come into a relationship.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; I don't care what your mother and
[2:24:39] father. They might be the best members
[2:24:41] of this church.
[2:24:44] That's why you're played with the world.
[2:24:45] That's why you have trouble with the
[2:24:47] world. Cuz you haven't had a birth yet.
[2:24:50] That's right.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; There's young people in this
[2:24:51] congregation and they gather at the
[2:24:54] young people's meeting and I I have gone
[2:24:56] in and seen them. And the thing that
[2:24:57] really really gets a hold of my heart is
[2:25:00] I know
[2:25:03] some of them aren't born again yet,
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; but they're carried along with the
[2:25:08] association and the fellowship and the
[2:25:10] friendship and they go outside and have
[2:25:12] just a wonderful time.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; But as of this moment, they're still
[2:25:16] lost.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:19] That's right.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; What does that do to a person when you
[2:25:23] preach your heart and soul out?
[2:25:27] They need to
[2:25:29] at least
[2:25:31] at least give themselves
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; and let let this transforming power
[2:25:36] change them.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together.
[2:25:47] Almighty God
[2:25:50] who chose and spoke and called Abraham
[2:25:53] and told him to leave his kindred,
[2:25:58] to leave his family
[2:26:00] and to go into a far country.
[2:26:04] God that spoke to Moses when he was in
[2:26:07] the wilderness after failing.
[2:26:10] His decision
[2:26:12] to settle an argument and to settle some
[2:26:14] strife. his decision to slay a man
[2:26:18] and now he's wandering as a shepherd as
[2:26:21] a just a servant
[2:26:26] appearing as a failure.
[2:26:29] He couldn't go back and rewrite it and
[2:26:31] neither did you want him to. But you
[2:26:33] interrupted and intervened
[2:26:35] in the midst of his event, in the midst
[2:26:38] of his
[2:26:41] work and labor as a shepherd
[2:26:44] and his life was changed forever. As
[2:26:47] your messenger said, what he lacked, the
[2:26:50] pillar of fire had.
[2:26:52] Lord, what the people lack, what I lack,
[2:26:54] what any of us here lack
[2:26:57] is is right present with us. The pillar
[2:26:59] of fire which delivered this message to
[2:27:02] us. The pillar of fire delivered a
[2:27:05] message to us. Out of the pillar of fire
[2:27:08] spoke a voice.
[2:27:11] We have received the message that has
[2:27:13] forerrun the second coming of Jesus
[2:27:16] Christ. And we're somewhere in that
[2:27:19] process.
[2:27:21] We're somewhere in that sequence. And oh
[2:27:25] god, it is a it's a very very
[2:27:28] treacherous place because the enemy
[2:27:31] would like to come in say oh it's way
[2:27:33] off in the future etc. You have time to
[2:27:35] do this. You have time to go and enjoy
[2:27:37] yourself and have time to make mistakes.
[2:27:39] Oh God, and not realizing all the time
[2:27:42] that what we are here, we're going to be
[2:27:44] beyond the veil. So we want to set our
[2:27:46] course. We want, oh God, we want you to
[2:27:49] intervene. I want and I'm asking that
[2:27:51] you will intervene and interrupt this
[2:27:53] service. Lord, I've come here and
[2:27:55] preached, oh God, what I felt you had
[2:27:57] delivered and brought to me on my heart
[2:27:59] and now I've delivered it to the people.
[2:28:01] And there are some that are sitting
[2:28:02] here, Lord. They need earnestly. They
[2:28:04] need desperately. They need this moment.
[2:28:06] They don't need to allow this moment to
[2:28:09] leave here. They need, oh God, to
[2:28:11] capture this moment at this time. And I
[2:28:14] pray, Father, that you will not permit
[2:28:16] them to postpone it, to procrastinate,
[2:28:19] and to set it off for another time. Oh,
[2:28:22] come, Holy Spirit. I pray take the words
[2:28:25] that have been spoken and brand them
[2:28:28] upon the hearts and the minds
[2:28:30] of the needy, especially the needy. And
[2:28:34] may we, oh God, that have been called to
[2:28:36] this hour for this purpose to be an
[2:28:39] expression of your coming. May we never
[2:28:41] forget that phrase.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; May we live honorably according to it
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; In the wonderful name of Jesus Christ.
[2:28:53] Oh God. Oh God. I'm going to give some
[2:28:58] time for this word to soak in and
[2:29:01] furthermore
[2:29:03] to let the Holy Spirit confirm the word
[2:29:05] with signs following. I feel it would be
[2:29:08] improper for me to close the service.
[2:29:11] There may be mothers and fathers.
[2:29:14] There may be others here
[2:29:17] that you say I I'm not where I ought to
[2:29:20] be at all. And in the light of the word,
[2:29:23] I can I want to confess the Holy Spirit
[2:29:26] has spoken very precisely to my heart
[2:29:30] and my soul. I want to stand as a
[2:29:33] testimony that I am responding to that.
[2:29:38] I want to perhaps sing
[2:29:42] the song.
[2:29:48] Who? Who is that knocking?
[2:30:14] I wonder if I can have brother Marco,
[2:30:16] would you just take that uh
[2:30:21] take it over to my wife? I will need
[2:30:24] some help. I want to sing. Who's that
[2:30:25] knocking? Who's that calling for me to
[2:30:28] come?
[2:30:30] I don't know all the words exactly.
[2:30:35] Brother Rod, do you know that chorus?
[2:30:47] Put power please for that.
[2:30:59] Who is that knocking,
[2:31:04] calling,
[2:31:07] seeking?
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; Who is that troubling
[2:31:13] my soul?
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; Surely it is Jesus.
[2:31:24] asking,
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; pleading,
[2:31:29] wanting
[2:31:31] to make
[2:31:33] me whole
[2:31:40] that calling
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; for me
[2:31:44] to come.
[2:31:48] Come and be saved
[2:31:52] from sin.
[2:31:57] Who is that calling
[2:32:01] for my
[2:32:03] poor heart
[2:32:07] wanting
[2:32:09] to be
[2:32:11] let in?
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; Why don't you pray while they're
[2:32:15] singing?
[2:32:17] Who is that calling,
[2:32:21] knocking,
[2:32:24] seeking?
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, who is that trling
[2:32:30] my soul?
[2:32:35] Surely
[2:32:37] it is Jesus
[2:32:41] asking
[2:32:44] leading
[2:32:46] wanting
[2:32:48] to make
[2:32:50] me.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; Who is that knocking? Who is that
[2:32:54] knocking?
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; Who is that knocking?
[2:33:01] calling,
[2:33:03] seeking.
[2:33:06] Who is that troubling
[2:33:10] my soul?
[2:33:15] Surely
[2:33:18] Jesus
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; asking
[2:33:26] he's wanting
[2:33:28] to make
[2:33:30] me home.
[2:33:32] Before we sing the chorus again, there
[2:33:34] may be some here that are have never
[2:33:37] received Christ
[2:33:39] or you're living in a place where you
[2:33:41] know that you need him now and you'd
[2:33:44] like to just step forward here and I'm
[2:33:46] going to pray. And if you have
[2:33:48] confidence in my prayer,
[2:33:51] not me. I just pray God will hear me
[2:33:55] and God will hear your heart
[2:33:58] and God will respond. I know that he
[2:34:00] will. I'm sure that he will.
[2:34:06] If you want to join me here at the
[2:34:08] platform, that will be fine, too. Then
[2:34:10] we're going to pray together.
[2:34:13] Who
[2:34:15] is that knocking,
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; calling,
[2:34:21] seeking?
[2:34:23] Who is that tring
[2:34:28] my soul? Surely
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; it's Jesus.
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; It's Jesus.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; It's Christing.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; It's Christ. Let's just move into that
[2:34:49] atmosphere. Let's sing that first verse
[2:34:51] again, please, dear.
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; Who is that calling? Who is it
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; for me
[2:35:00] to come?
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; Who do you say this is?
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; Come and come and be saved
[2:35:07] from sin.
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; Who is that seeking
[2:35:17] for my
[2:35:19] poor heart?
[2:35:23] wanting
[2:35:25] to make me.
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; That's what he wants to do is make us
[2:35:29] whole. Who whole.
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; Who is that knocking?
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; Who's knocking?
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; Calling.
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; Who's calling?
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; Seeking.
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; Whose voice is that I hear?
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; Who is that?
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; My soul. Oh, who's troubling my soul
[2:35:51] just now? Oh, surely
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; it's Jesus
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; asking
[2:36:05] to make
[2:36:07] me home.
[2:36:10] Oh,
[2:36:13] is that knocking,
[2:36:17] calling, calling,
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; seeking?
[2:36:23] Who is that troubling
[2:36:27] my soul?
[2:36:33] &gt;&gt; Surely,
[2:36:35] it's Jesus. Jesus
[2:36:38] asking,
[2:36:40] pleading,
[2:36:43] wanting
[2:36:45] to make
[2:36:47] me whole.
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; We want to pray.
[2:36:53] And when you bow and pray with me, I
[2:36:55] want you to say within your heart,
[2:36:58] I'm praying
[2:37:01] that I shall enter into an era of
[2:37:03] transformation in my life.
[2:37:07] I shall not be the person that I have
[2:37:10] been.
[2:37:12] I will allow the word first place in my
[2:37:15] life.
[2:37:17] Don't look to the failings. Don't look
[2:37:21] to the weakness.
[2:37:23] Look to the solution. Look to the
[2:37:25] resource. Look to him who's speaking.
[2:37:27] Look to him who's troubling
[2:37:29] your heart just now. Look to him who's
[2:37:31] stirring. Stirring. Why would he be
[2:37:33] stirring? Because he's here. He's here
[2:37:36] to do more than you could even ask or
[2:37:38] think for. Think of
[2:37:41] Oh, lovely Lord Jesus. Lovely Lord
[2:37:44] Jesus. Give us a comprehension. Give us
[2:37:47] an enlightenment. Help us to see,
[2:37:49] Father, in truth, who it is that is
[2:37:52] here. Help us to see, oh God, and to
[2:37:54] acknowledge what you have spoken that
[2:37:56] the angels of God are actually here to
[2:37:58] energize the faith of the people. The
[2:38:01] Holy Spirit is here. You have sent this
[2:38:04] urging of the Holy Spirit. You've sent
[2:38:06] this sweet gentleman. Oh, this lovely
[2:38:09] gentleman called the Holy Spirit. The
[2:38:12] spirit, the Holy Ghost, oh spirit of
[2:38:14] God, fall upon our people. fall upon us,
[2:38:18] oh God, and from within. Come down into
[2:38:21] the very deepest resource of the soul, I
[2:38:24] pray, Lord, and begin to illuminate and
[2:38:26] cast out darkness, out of the dark
[2:38:29] places, and there's tithers places,
[2:38:31] Lord, where your people are in a state
[2:38:34] of question, in a state of quandry. I
[2:38:36] pray that you'll be the answer and the
[2:38:38] solution, Lord, to their question. Oh
[2:38:41] God, some are in a dilemma at this
[2:38:43] moment. I pray that you'll be the
[2:38:45] solution for the dilemma. Oh God, some
[2:38:48] are in need, but we're not praying so
[2:38:49] much for the for the needs of this life,
[2:38:51] but we're praying for these spiritual
[2:38:53] needs. Oh God, that the next time they
[2:38:55] come and sit in this congregation, they
[2:38:57] will have already experienced a powerful
[2:39:00] transformation of the Holy Spirit. Oh
[2:39:03] God, I pray you'll burn up dross, burn
[2:39:06] up the emptiness. Oh God, burn up these
[2:39:09] things that are needlessly encroaching
[2:39:11] upon our spiritual life. Burn up the
[2:39:13] frivolity, Lord. Burn up the world. Move
[2:39:17] the world out, oh God. Move every trace
[2:39:19] of the world out, I pray. And may our
[2:39:22] whole focus and all of our energy be a
[2:39:26] focused, oh God, and be in one
[2:39:28] direction. And that is for your
[2:39:29] achievement. Your achievement to express
[2:39:32] yourself. Come, come, oh, Holy Spirit.
[2:39:35] Come, I pray. Fill us, oh God. FILL US.
[2:39:38] SUPERCHARGE US, OH GOD. Fill us, I pray,
[2:39:41] Lord. PHYLLIS, LET THIS CONGREGATION,
[2:39:44] LET EVERY MAN WHO KNOWS TO PRAY, every
[2:39:46] woman who knows TO PRAY, LET ME HEAR
[2:39:48] YOUR VOICE CALLING UPON THIS GOD THAT
[2:39:50] YOU BELIEVE IS PRESENT WITH US, CALLING
[2:39:52] UPON this Christ, come, oh transforming
[2:39:56] light, come, oh holy power, come, oh
[2:40:01] creator, create in us a new heart,
[2:40:04] create in us a clean heart, create in
[2:40:06] us, oh God, what would glorify you and
[2:40:09] express you, oh Lord. Lord. Oh Lord. Oh
[2:40:14] Lord.
[2:40:17] My Lord. My Lord.
[2:40:19] Oh God. Oh God. We need a
[2:40:22] transformation.
[2:40:24] Oh God. Every man, every woman, my Lord,
[2:40:29] my God. Come, I pray, in all of your
[2:40:32] beauty and all of your glory. Come, oh,
[2:40:34] Holy Spirit, and give them a give them
[2:40:37] an experience they've not had before in
[2:40:40] the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:40:42] Hallelujah.
[2:40:44] &gt;&gt; If God has spoken to you, young men,
[2:40:45] call upon him. Lift your hands up and
[2:40:48] surrender to him. Give him give him all
[2:40:52] of yourself. Here I am, Lord. Take me.
[2:40:55] Take me. Take me, Father. Let me be what
[2:40:58] I've never been before. Transform me, oh
[2:41:01] God. LET ME BE THAT KIND OF A TESTIMONY.
[2:41:05] WE'RE HERE UNDER THE OPICES OF THE HOLY
[2:41:09] SPIRIT TO TESTIFY THAT CHRIST HAS COME
[2:41:12] AMONGST US. THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE
[2:41:14] TESTIFYING.
[2:41:15] Oh God, let this ring so deep into the
[2:41:18] hearts of the people. Pray in the name
[2:41:20] of Jesus Christ,
[2:41:23] let the Holy Spirit, somebody need to
[2:41:26] say yes. I'll say yes. I'm going to say
[2:41:30] yes to you, oh God. Going to say yes to
[2:41:32] your will. Say yes to your way. I'm
[2:41:36] going to say no to myself.
[2:41:39] I'm going to say no to just the things
[2:41:41] of this world. I'm going to say yes to
[2:41:43] you,
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; mighty God. In the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:41:49] In the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:41:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Let God have his
[2:41:56] way back there.
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Call upon him.
[2:42:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Call upon him.
[2:42:06] Oh God.
[2:42:09] There needs to be a yielding here. Let
[2:42:11] this congregation yield now. Just yield.
[2:42:14] Don't be silent about it. Just yield.
[2:42:17] Say, "Father, I'm here. I'm standing for
[2:42:19] a purpose. Lord, I don't want to leave.
[2:42:23] I will not leave this building with
[2:42:24] anything less than the full measure that
[2:42:27] you have for me this morning."
[2:42:29] &gt;&gt; This man preached his heart out. Oh God,
[2:42:32] CORRECT THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE
[2:42:34] CORRECTED in my life.
[2:42:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:42:50] &gt;&gt; Spirit of God,
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; break me, mold me,
[2:42:55] shape me.
[2:42:59] Lord.
[2:43:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:04] Someone's praying.
[2:43:07] Lord,
[2:43:09] come by.
[2:43:15] Someone's
[2:43:19] &gt;&gt; I trust you're praying. Call.
[2:43:24] Call upon him. Call upon him. Oh my
[2:43:30] Lord,
[2:43:33] come my
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; Come by here, my Lord.
[2:43:48] &gt;&gt; Come by here, my Lord.
[2:43:54] Come by here.
[2:44:00] Come
[2:44:02] here. Come on. Lord,
[2:44:06] come
[2:44:08] here.
[2:44:12] Come by here. My Lord,
[2:44:18] come by.
[2:44:24] Oh Lord
[2:44:27] might
[2:44:32] I am
[2:44:36] Lord
[2:44:39] God.
[2:44:44] Oh, I am near
[2:44:52] I hear.
[2:44:57] I am here.
[2:45:03] Come here.
[2:45:08] Oh,
[2:45:11] come
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; all to Jesus. I surrender.
[2:45:30] All to Jesus
[2:45:35] I
[2:45:37] surrender
[2:45:41] all
[2:45:43] to him.
[2:45:53] I
[2:45:55] will never
[2:46:07] presence.
[2:46:16] I
[2:46:18] surrender
[2:46:21] all.
[2:46:27] I
[2:46:30] surrender
[2:46:33] all
[2:46:41] to Jesus.
[2:46:45] Bless his savior.
[2:46:50] Christ
[2:46:59] again.
[2:47:01] I
[2:47:04] surrender.
[2:47:12] I
[2:47:15] surrender
[2:47:18] all
[2:47:25] to be
[2:47:28] myior.
[2:47:34] your eyes.
[2:47:43] Oh yes, I
[2:47:48] surrender.
[2:47:51] Oh
[2:47:56] Lord, I Lord I surrender.
[2:48:01] I surrender all.
[2:48:06] Oh
[2:48:10] to thee
[2:48:12] all my blessings.
[2:48:17] Oh Lord I
[2:48:21] surrender
[2:48:24] all.
[2:48:28] Then why do you wait dear brother? Why
[2:48:30] do you tarry so long?
[2:48:35] I want to sing a few lines while you're
[2:48:38] standing, while you're praying.
[2:48:42] I feel inclined. I feel led. There may
[2:48:45] be someone that's still waiting.
[2:48:50] I feel that the Holy Spirit is speaking
[2:48:54] and it's saying, "Why do you wait?
[2:48:58] Why do you wait, dear brother?
[2:49:02] Death changes nothing.
[2:49:06] And when you cross over, there will be a
[2:49:08] great white throne judgment.
[2:49:11] And the peoples will be gathered
[2:49:16] and there'll be the believers
[2:49:19] and the bride will sit with him.
[2:49:24] I've thought of this
[2:49:27] and I would need extra grace from God
[2:49:32] because I'm not one that would relish or
[2:49:35] cherish
[2:49:36] the kind of moment
[2:49:39] where I could be gathered by his grace,
[2:49:41] by his love, by his grace. And those of
[2:49:45] us that will be gathered certainly will
[2:49:47] be standing with him
[2:49:50] in a great white throne judgment. And
[2:49:53] there will be those that will be
[2:49:54] gathered. I would I don't relish the
[2:49:57] thought of looking down
[2:49:59] and seeing a face
[2:50:02] of one that sat in the service
[2:50:05] and I knew that God was dealing with
[2:50:07] them. And I knew they were not
[2:50:10] converted.
[2:50:12] and to see them standing there at the
[2:50:15] great white throne judgment. But
[2:50:17] friends, the Bible before me, that's
[2:50:21] going to happen.
[2:50:23] And this is the opportunity God's giving
[2:50:26] you every opportunity. God is the
[2:50:29] straining of the Holy Spirit, the
[2:50:31] pleading of the Holy Spirit, THE CALL OF
[2:50:34] GOD. IT'S NOT A MAN THAT YOU WITHSTAND.
[2:50:38] It's not a It's not just a sermon. It's
[2:50:40] not just a SUNDAY MORNING. THIS IS NOT
[2:50:42] JUST A CHURCH. THIS IS A PEOPLE
[2:50:44] representing the coming of Jesus Christ.
[2:50:51] &gt;&gt; THE MESSENGERS COME GONE. MALACHI 4,
[2:50:54] LUKE 17:30, REVELATION 10:7 HAPPENED.
[2:50:58] GONE.
[2:51:00] You say, "Well, I wish I could have
[2:51:01] LIVED THERE." LISTEN TO ME. Listen to
[2:51:03] me.
[2:51:05] You don't want to go A LITTLE FURTHER
[2:51:06] DOWN THE road and said, "I WISH I WOULD
[2:51:07] HAVE SURRENDERED THEN." RIGHT?
[2:51:09] &gt;&gt; You don't WANT TO FIND YOURSELF ON THE
[2:51:11] OTHER SIDE. SO, I should have done it.
[2:51:14] So, you're trying to scare us. I'm more
[2:51:17] than scaring YOU. I'M PERSUADING YOU
[2:51:19] WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S IN ME.
[2:51:22] &gt;&gt; You think THIS IS SCARY? BE ON THE OTHER
[2:51:24] SIDE or get to the very last MOMENT. AND
[2:51:28] THE PROPHET EVEN DESCRIBES IT WITH DEATH
[2:51:30] LEAVING, LIFE LEAVING YOUR BODY. SAY, I
[2:51:33] I I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.
[2:51:36] I stood at my uncle's bedside and and
[2:51:38] and he he WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING. HE
[2:51:40] WAS STRUGGLING IN BED. HE WAS TRYING TO
[2:51:42] SAY SOMETHING to me and the nurse
[2:51:44] thought he was in distress. He gave him
[2:51:46] a shot. He never woke up. He slipped on
[2:51:48] the next few minutes. I've never wanted
[2:51:51] knowing what he wanted to say. What have
[2:51:54] you wanted to say? You don't want to
[2:51:56] look in the eyes OF JESUS SAID, "OH, I I
[2:51:58] WANTED TO SAY forgive me, but I I I
[2:52:01] didn't." Why didn't you?
[2:52:06] I want to surrender.
[2:52:12] Why do you wait, dear brother?
[2:52:15] Why do you tar so long?
[2:52:18] Don't t
[2:52:20] give them all now.
[2:52:23] I have no order to this service. The
[2:52:25] order of this service is the order of
[2:52:26] the Holy Spirit.
[2:52:32] Don't linger.
[2:52:35] Don't wait.
[2:52:38] Let's meet on the other side rejoicing.
[2:52:43] Let's take a verse of that, Brother Rod,
[2:52:45] and then we're going to close.
[2:52:48] Pray with me, will you?
[2:52:49] &gt;&gt; Why do you wait,
[2:52:53] dear brother?
[2:52:58] &gt;&gt; Why do you tear
[2:53:02] so long?
[2:53:05] Your Savior is waiting
[2:53:10] to give you
[2:53:14] a place in his sanctified
[2:53:18] throne.
[2:53:22] So why
[2:53:25] not?
[2:53:27] Why
[2:53:29] not?
[2:53:31] Why not come to me now?
[2:53:40] Why
[2:53:42] not?
[2:53:44] Why?
[2:53:49] Why not come to him?
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; The chorus again. Why?
[2:53:59] God,
[2:54:02] why
[2:54:04] God?
[2:54:06] Why I come to him now?
[2:54:14] Oh, why
[2:54:17] God?
[2:54:19] Why?
[2:54:23] Why
[2:54:26] come to him now?
[2:54:31] Just you might know that the Holy Spirit
[2:54:32] has ordered this service.
[2:54:35] I had an entire slide presentation
[2:54:38] for you this morning
[2:54:42] and I laid it all aside.
[2:54:46] Probably a good half hour, a slide
[2:54:47] presentation
[2:54:49] with scriptures and quotes that I felt
[2:54:52] were for you. Lord willing, if we have
[2:54:55] another meeting, we'll have another
[2:54:57] time.
[2:54:58] Until then, I'm going to commit you to
[2:55:00] God and the words that have been spoken
[2:55:02] to God. going to pray that this word
[2:55:05] will really
[2:55:08] sink very very deep in the coming days.
[2:55:10] That you'll ponder it very very deeply.
[2:55:14] And even those of us in the congregation
[2:55:16] who have been in the way a long time
[2:55:20] and you have a good grasp of the
[2:55:22] message, don't ever think for a moment
[2:55:24] that you've got it all
[2:55:27] &gt;&gt; because we don't have it all.
[2:55:29] &gt;&gt; And I'm raising some questions. We don't
[2:55:32] want to go in a false security that
[2:55:35] we're way up the road and we're way
[2:55:37] ahead of everybody else. That just ain't
[2:55:40] so. It's just not It's not so because
[2:55:44] God is God is stirring our nest.
[2:55:49] God is really digging very, very deep.
[2:55:52] And we need to have that take place in
[2:55:54] our lives.
[2:55:56] We'll bow in prayer. Our heavenly
[2:55:57] father,
[2:56:00] so kind, so kind,
[2:56:04] so thankful, so thankful, Lord,
[2:56:07] for the words that have been given to us
[2:56:13] by God from your very mouth and through
[2:56:17] your mouthpiece, your prophet messenger.
[2:56:21] And when you have told us and confirmed
[2:56:24] to us that you loved fatherhood,
[2:56:28] then I can stand here today and these
[2:56:31] people can stand
[2:56:33] knowing that you have brought us here
[2:56:36] because you so loved to express yourself
[2:56:39] as a father. And as a father, you'll
[2:56:42] provide what we have need of. And Lord,
[2:56:44] we stand here needy people. I have need.
[2:56:49] &gt;&gt; Everyone has need.
[2:56:51] And Lord, I the one thing I desire and I
[2:56:54] pray for earnestly that you will reveal
[2:56:56] yourself and more of yourself in your
[2:56:58] word. Reveal yourself to me. Lord, I
[2:57:00] just live off your word. This nothing
[2:57:03] means so much as to be able to see you.
[2:57:05] See you, Lord Jesus. See you magnified
[2:57:07] and see you exalted and see you in your
[2:57:09] word. And and then to live, Lord, live
[2:57:12] in the people. You desired to live in
[2:57:14] the people. You wanted the preeminence.
[2:57:15] This was one of your great great
[2:57:17] achievements to to achieve and you have
[2:57:19] a motive for doing it. Lord, I say
[2:57:22] today, let my voice ring out into
[2:57:24] eternity. Have the preeminence, oh God.
[2:57:29] &gt;&gt; In your people have the preeminence
[2:57:32] when we gather together. May you have
[2:57:34] the preeminence.
[2:57:36] And then Lord, the last that your
[2:57:39] prophet spoke of to restore us back to
[2:57:43] that original Eden.
[2:57:45] Oh, take us back. We're on our way back,
[2:57:48] Lord. I just can't seem to move fast
[2:57:50] enough. I want to move back, oh God, to
[2:57:53] that original Eden, Lord, and all of its
[2:57:55] Eden beauty and all of its Eden harmony
[2:57:57] and all of its Eden fellowship, Lord.
[2:57:59] How we desire that, oh God, let the
[2:58:02] millennium come, Father, let the
[2:58:05] orchestra start up, Lord. Let the angel
[2:58:07] band begin to sing, oh God, for the
[2:58:10] saints are coming home. Lord Jesus, I
[2:58:13] pray you'll bless this people. Bless all
[2:58:16] who have prayed. Bless all who have
[2:58:17] surrendered, all who have raised their
[2:58:19] hand, all that have opened their heart
[2:58:21] to receive the word, Lord, in the name
[2:58:24] of Jesus Christ.
[2:58:26] Amen. Let's all stand, please. Blessed
[2:58:29] be the tithe that binds our heart and
[2:58:31] Christian love. And you may shake hands
[2:58:33] with one another. And you're dismissed.
[2:58:36] Pray for me, would you? As we pray for
[2:58:39] one another.
[2:58:41] Look forward to seeing you if you are
[2:58:42] able to be here at the memorial service
[2:58:44] tomorrow.
[2:58:45] Blessed be
[2:58:48] the t
[2:58:50] that
[2:58:54] our hearts
[2:58:56] in great
[2:59:02] The fellowship
[2:59:06] of keep
[2:59:10] his life
[2:59:12] to that
[2:59:14] of God
[2:59:18] with me.
[2:59:26] Oh,
[2:59:42] heat, heat.
