Joel Waldner askked us to remember a friend. The doctors have said that she may have breast cancer. pray that God will make this trial a blessing for them and that they may be led to Christ through this experience, through this trial. Amen. If you have a need upon your heart this morning, just lift it before the Lord as we go to prayer. God bless you. [Music] Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. Our dear precious heavenly father, you mean more than life to us this morning &gt;&gt; as we have gathered in this house, a house where we gather to lift up that holy name of the lovely Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And we can say from the depths of our heart, you mean more than life to me. Father, we see this whole world. It's groping in darkness, but you've given us light to see. You've given us eyes to eyes to behold the glory of God. You've come by our way in the resurrection, Lord Jesus. And you've quickened a seed gene that dwells within. And so there's something Lord that is beating on the inside crying for more of you. crying for adoption, crying for a change, that the great I am would come down this morning in a special way, anointing our hearts to believe, for all things are possible to them that believe. As brother Joe has put this request forward, I'm sure there's many hands that are raised this morning as mine are. Those that have joined on the way of the internet, I'm sure their hearts are raised also knowing that you see the very thought and intent of every heart that is here. So Lord, great high priest, may we touch the hem of your garment this morning by faith, not looking to man, but looking to the great I am. For all things are possible this morning. Lord, would you touch the needy? Would you save the lost? Will you heal the sick? Lord, would the resurrection come by our way? meet with us in a special way. For the musicians, Lord, may it be a special encounter as they minister to your people. The soundmen, the video men. Lord, may you come by their way. Anointing them, Lord, as they offer their love gift to us. And as the pastor comes, anoint the gift, Lord. Anoint the man of God. Anoint our ears to hear. Let the spirit speak. May the Holy Ghost move. May lives be changed. May word upon word be deposited within our hearts. Lord, I feel a a charge within. God, move upon us, Lord, as we see the day approach. The hour of the change is upon us. May our eyes be turned heavenward. And may God you anoint this church like never before. May you meet us in a very special way. May all carnality go. May the expectation be high. May you move amongst us Lord Jesus meeting our every need. Bless us now in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God bless you each and everyone as you have your seats this morning. Say God bless you to those that are listening on the telephone hookup and on the internet hookup. Certainly want to say God bless you to you as well. Brother Gary St. John and his daughter and uh brother Nathan Hildebrandt have a special. So why don't they come and get ready this morning do have a quick announcement to let you know about. We do want to remember young peoples on Friday evening. this Friday night, 7:30 in the fellowship room, young people's meeting. BCA would also like to invite you for a guided tour. Those that aren't aware, an email has been sent out. There's a signup sheet on the bulletin board. You can take a tour of the new school building that's being built and constructed. How many have been able to participate in labor? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's appreciate that with a hand clap. Amen. Amen. Much work has gone into the building and we certainly appreciate all those that have taken their time and energy and strength and put into the school. We want to welcome Sister Leah Leton, I believe, from Finland. Where's Sister Leah at this morning? God bless you. Could you stand? God bless you. Amen. It's quite a journey from Finland. It's good to have you here in the service this morning. Got brother Luis is back from Argentina and Chile. And where's Brother Luis? Brother Luis, God bless you. It's good to have you back this morning. Amen. Anyone else that's visiting with us, we certainly want to welcome you into the service this morning. Trust this special is a blessing. And we'll be turning right to the word. He's glad to be walking down the road. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I just looked up a quote. The the name of the song is there is a road and brother Brandham said going beyond the camp in 1964. He said notice as they went out into the wilderness there were miracles signs when they moved into the camp. Now remember they left Egypt's camp and moved out into the wilderness with God's camp. He said, "How do you know it was?" God said, "Your people will s shall s sojourn for 400 years, but I'll bring them out with a mighty hand." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I'll give them this land there, and they'll be on their road by a vindicated light, a vindicated prophet with signs, wonders that God was in the camp. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they were on their road. They had a pillar of fire. They had a prophet. They had the mana. They had the living waters. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just came in. &gt;&gt; Little song we put together. Pray for us that the anointing would stake as it is here already. [Music] There is a way that leads to life. The few that find it never die. Pass mountain peaks graced white with snow. The way grows brighter as it goes. There is a road inside of you. &gt;&gt; Inside of me there is one too. No stumbling pilgrim in the dark. The road to Zion's in your heart. The river runs beside the road. It's waters living as they flow. In liquid voice the water calls on thirsty knees a pilgrim falls. There is a road inside of you. Inside of me there is one too. No stumbling pilgrim in the dark. The road to science in your heart. Sometimes a shadow, dark and cold, lays like a mist across the road. But be encouraged by the side. Where there's a shadow, there's a light. There is a rope inside of you. Inside of me, there is one, too. &gt;&gt; No stumbling pilgrim in the dawn. The road to Zion's in your heart. Sometimes it's good to look back down. We've come so far we've gained such ground. But joy is not in where we've been. Joy is who's waiting at the end. There is a road inside of you. Inside of me, there is one, too. No stumbling pil. [Music] The road to Zion's in your heart. There is a road inside of you. Inside of me, there is one, two. No stumbling per in the dark. The road to Zion in your heart. A road to Zion in your heart. &gt;&gt; Lead me, Lord, I'll follow. Lead me, Lord, I'll follow. I appreciate that special this morning. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Lead me, Lord, I'll follow. as the Sunday school children find their way in but our pastor to come this morning. [Music] Lead me Lord [Music] I will follow. Lead me Lord I will go. You have called me. I will answer. Lead me home. I will go. Lead me home. I will follow. [Music] Lead me. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, you love me. I will answer. [Music] I will go. He is here. Hallelujah. He is here. Amen. [Music] He is here. Holy. Holy. I will pray his name for me. [Music] Oh, you will never be the same for he is. Why don't we stand together this morning? You desire to speak to your heart. It's a declaration this morning. Break what is your heart this morning. [Music] Holy, holy. I will bless his holy name for he is here. [Music] [Music] You will never be the same. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That sounds good. You'll never be the same. I want to leave this place today being at a different level. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be the same as when we came in, do we? Amen. Uh I'm going to go to the word right away, but I thought I'd like to sing just before we do. Uh Lord, I just want I want to just thank you, Lord, for letting me hear thy word. We don't want to be just uh attendees this morning, but we want to hear. And it takes something more than us just being attentive. That's good. Being real uh and filled with expectation, that's good. But it just takes a little something more. And that's something divine. &gt;&gt; Give me an understanding. Open my mind. Let me hear what it is you're saying. Speak by your Holy Spirit. So I wonder, brother Derek, brother Ryan, if we can just sing that, please. &gt;&gt; Want to thank you, Lord. Oh, thank him for letting me hear your word. [Music] How my God the glory revealed in me for that special night when I saw your life wonderful with eternal life I thank you let's sing the verse first verse to open my eyes. All the angel I was living in was then I heard recognizing your name and perfect and the message of praise. [Music] I just want to thank you Lord for letting me hear your word. I am I [Music] glorify [Music] [Music] Even in my wildest dreams I see I see the Is that true of the Lord the rapture mystery [Music] I heard by God simplicity the strong Where is your Lord? I thank you. [Music] My son [Music] glorious [Music] face to face with eternal life. Lord, I thank you. And we do thank you, Lord. [Music] We do thank you. We thank you, Lord. This is a special moment. We're together. We're together in a place of prayer, in a place of correction, in a place of revelation. We don't know how to thank you for hearing, allowing us to hear your word. I think of that special moment, that special time each one of us have it when it was as though the lights went on. A glorious glow, a glow of glory just spread upon our souls. Such a warmth and such a beauty. And from then on, it's been a glorious walk. how we thank you for this walk, oh God. And we're able once again to gather around your word. We're still here in the land of the living. So you have a purpose for us today. You have a purpose, Father, for each one that is here and each one that is streaming. Those, oh God, in other places and other lands. We ask, Father, that you will bless the bride of Jesus Christ with a special blessing. All those that minister, all those that stand behind the pullpit and seek to edify and build up the body of Christ. We have the promise that one day, oh God, and that's why we're here. One day truly, all of these natural things will pass away and we'll be in the perfection and the beauty of a restored Eden. Pray you'll bless us, oh God, today and anoint speaker and hearers I yield myself to you, Lord. I trust you'll cause me to say what should be said and that you'll bless the hearers. May it sink to the realm of the soul. I pray in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll invite you to take your Bibles, please, and turn turn me with me to Revelation 21. Now I had asked if you would uh read future home and who is this Melzdc. Uh future home tells of our home a future home. and who is our Melzdc uh speaks a great deal about our body and the person that will be in that home. So that's what we want to uh speak about this morning. Brother Brandon said this Bible love letter is something God writes to us. He's hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and he will reveal it to babes such as would learn. So this Bible that we have and we'll be reading from is a love letter. Uh last Sunday I spoke on the a great voice out of heaven and it was very appropriate that brother Darren had shown to the people and yourself the new website with the with the hub to me. I don't even really call it I call it a massive library of the prophet's voice and his message uh in different languages. And to me it was it could only happen in this time. The Bible says in Isaiah and there's a lot of scriptures that have a lot of different meaning to us now. Excuse me. Thou shalt not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain. For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the heavens or as the waters cover the sea and another place as the waters. And now the voice of God covers the earth. &gt;&gt; As the waters cover the sea. &gt;&gt; It couldn't happen in any other age. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've read that scripture many times and never even made sense to me really. I wondered how that was ever going to happen. But today, the word of God is encircling, the bleeding word is encircling this globe. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; And we've received it. We've received the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So last Sunday we spoke of the future home more as a place prepared for the redeemed and a great voice from heaven that God has sent in our day to prepare us and to convey us to that place. Today I want to emphasize on on the our home as being this this our dwelling place. This is what God gave us to dwell in or home. This is your home. Say, "Well, I'm going home." Well, you wouldn't enjoy home very much if you were in some decrepit afflicted condition. In fact, they might take you to another place. Not too long ago, and I'm just keeping you standing for a moment. Not too long ago, I had a I had to take my aunt. My aunt has been very independent and very self-sufficient. And she doesn't need any financial help or anything. And she drives her own car. She just turned 80. And uh but she has sugar diabetes and she wasn't looking after it. And she was in bad condition. and they had to take her three three times in one month to by ambulance to the hospital. So there's she doesn't have any children. She doesn't have any family. I'm her nephew. She has another nephew and one great niece. And the three of us got together and said she and a doctor said she cannot go home. I will not permit her to go home. You'll have to have a place for her. And sometimes you can wait on a list for a year or two years to find a place in a senior citizen's home. It's one place that had a temporary home, a Baptist home over here in South Sur. And we had to take her there. And the room was just a tiny room maybe 12 ft across and a little al cove where there was a bed. And here is a cabinet and a sink and a bathroom there. And we had to put her in there and she's there today. And this is now this is your home. Well, that's tragic. That's tragic. And just go to the senior citizens homes. I don't know about you, I don't want to have to go there. I've told my family if I get that condition, push me over a cliff. I just don't want to go there. But we do want to go to our eternal home. &gt;&gt; All right. So, we'll be talking about that. All right. We'll read out of uh Revelation the 21st chapter. Uh reading from verse one. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first earth, the first heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there was no more sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God, out of heaven, prepared as a bride, adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men." I'm glad that voice is there. &gt;&gt; And he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people. And God himself shall be with them and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears. Notice please. Tears from their eyes. And there shall be no more death. Neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed away. Before we read the next scripture, I would like you just to notice, please, you're all going to go home sometime today, wherever your residence is. But I can guarantee you that residence has never had tears. That residence has never known death. That residence has never known sorrow or pain. And neither has it had any crying. It's it's this home. It's this home that has pain &gt;&gt; and sorrow and crying and tears and death. And it's this home that God's interested in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll read a second scripture, please, in 2 Corinthians 5 and just a few verses there. Starting with verse one. For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God and house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this we grown earnestly, desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven. If so be that being clothed, we shall not be found naked. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened, not for that which we would be unclothed, but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up in life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavenly Father, bless now this time as we study and read and speak in Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated. Apostle Paul says that we shall not be found if so being clothed, we shall not be found naked. And the message to the Leodysian church is that they were wretched and naked and blind. They they they didn't have anything no covering when they were presented when they came into the presence of God. I want you to notice in these uh in this last scripture reading which we had, Apostle Paul speaks of our body as our house of this tabernacle, a building of God. He says, "For we know that if our earthly house," I want you to think very personally now. You have a personal earthly house, but this earthly house is not not remaining, you know, it's not the status quo. As time goes on, you will find things change &gt;&gt; imperceptibly almost, but things change &gt;&gt; and you'll find that age will take its toll on you regardless of your health and beauty at this time and your strength of your youth. There's a lot of young people and young men and young ladies and even teenagers and younger go to the children's hospital and it's heart-wrenching. I've been there. We've had people that have had children who've been there. &gt;&gt; And it's heart-wrenching &gt;&gt; to see the little ones suffering. This world is a suffering place. &gt;&gt; And I can't I cannot help but long for a place where there is no sorrow or crying or pain because there's something in here calling out for that. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so Apostle Paul says if that earthly house if if we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle and this is profoundly deep and I want you to follow me very very close and listen very attentively. Our earthly house of this tabernacle we're dissolved. We have a building &gt;&gt; not we will have. We have a building of God &gt;&gt; and house not made with hands &gt;&gt; eternal in the heavens. &gt;&gt; It's without beginning without end. &gt;&gt; And this for in this we grown earnestly to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven. If we go back to the beginning and we have to go back to the beginning to get a real understanding. If you go back to the beginning and of the beginning of creation and you see a we speak about Eden. Soon as we see about Eden, we think of perfection. We think of something that is in perfect harmony. There's a scripture that says, "And the Lord God planted a garden eastward." No garden ever. You could go to butcher gardens or the beautiful gardens of the hanging gardens or whatever more. You'll never never imagine a garden as God planted a garden &gt;&gt; and he made it just right &gt;&gt; for his son Adam and his wife Eve. And the Bible tells us and there and there he put the man whom he had formed. I want to put the emphasis on that. The man that he had formed. There was a a harmonizing between the place. Eden wasn't the home. It was the place where the home was going to be. &gt;&gt; The home was what God had given Adam, the first man, Adam, which was a spirit man to live in. &gt;&gt; And he formed a body and gave him a body. God formed a constructed a body, a permanent house, a home for the first man, Adam, to dwell in. The scripture says, and for those of you that are are well acquainted with the message, as most of you are, uh we know that the first man, let us make man in our image and after our likeness. And then the scripture says, "And so God made man in his image." And the trinitarians get hung up on let us. &gt;&gt; And I go along with them and I say, "Okay, that's fine. Did God make one in his image?" Yes, we have to believe that because he said, "Let us make man in our image." I said, "When he was done, how many people did he have, &gt;&gt; didn't have three, &gt;&gt; didn't have two, &gt;&gt; he had one &gt;&gt; when he was done." &gt;&gt; And then he called their plural name Adam &gt;&gt; singular &gt;&gt; because even as God, he has masculine, feminine, he has got every relationship within him, but he's one God. Hear you, oh Israel. The Lord your God is one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You You've got the ability to be mother, to be father, to be an aunt, to be this, to be a husband, to be a wife, to be all. But you're one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you love your children different from when you love your wife or your wife love your husband different than you love your children? How how can you have such a such a diverse capacity within you? Because you made like God made you that way. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can love your brothers and sisters, but you you have a special relationship with others. And so we won't get on to that. But then he placed this house &gt;&gt; in a beautiful garden. &gt;&gt; And the first man, Adam, was perfectly perfectly harmonized with his dwelling place. We speak of our future home as a home. And we often think of heaven as our home. But then the scripture says rather in the future home in that message future home there will be houses of pure gold there will be avenues and parks and gardens and the river of life coming trickling out of the throne running down through the chasms and oh over the terraces and the tree of life will be blooming in every yard and and bear its fruits 12 times a year. And we we think of that as a home. But I want to digress from that. I want to think about this house. And as uh the old song that was written by Stuart Hamlin when I was a lot younger, but I think you probably may have heard it. This old house. &gt;&gt; How many have you ever heard this old house? Oh, we've got some friends. For all of you that haven't heard about this old house. This old house once knew its children. This old house once knew its wife, his wife. This old house was home and comfort as they fought the storms of life. This old house once rang with laughter. This old house heard many shouts. Now he trembles in the darkness when the lightning walks about. Ain't going to need this house &gt;&gt; no longer. Ain't going to need this house no more. Ain't got time to fix the windows. Ain't got time to fix the floor. Ain't got time to oil the hinges. Nor to mend the window pane. Ain't going to need this house no longer. He's getting ready to meet the saints. &gt;&gt; Haven't got any time any longer. This old house, that's not the house that we want to stay in very long. Amen. &gt;&gt; You might be full of all vim and vigor and and ready to do things and that's just fine. Just let a little time go by and you'll be saying, "You know what? I agree with old brother Ed. I just can't do what I used to do." &gt;&gt; I used to I worked for a short time. I won't be long on this, but I worked for a short time with a old rancher and he was rugged. He was rugged and he had horses and cattle. He had so many horses, he didn't even know how many. And he used to tell about us. He'd go on into the night and we'd were trying to go to sleep and he'd be talking in the dark, you know, and we just had bunk beds and old ranch house sort of thing. And and he'd be talking about the old Bronx that he broke and everything else. He was all crippled and broken up, you know, he walked like this. He was probably in his late 70s and he'd say, "And I can still do it." So me and the other young fellow, you know, we'd get on and we'd say, "Well, here we got a couple Bronx out here. Why don't we do it? We'd like to see you break another one. Show us how." He never took us up on it. But inside, he was still youthful man. I can still do it. &gt;&gt; See, but this old house needed some oil in the hinges. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. I'm just setting the pace. The house as Paul speaks of it. And you'll have to allow me some time to lay some foundation here. The house as Paul speaks of it. And it's so wonderful. You know, God knew that the Bible was going to be written even in the Greek language, the New Testament. And the house is of course of the uh a a home, a dwelling, a household. But it's more than just a house. It's an inhabited house. &gt;&gt; This isn't just a shell. I'll just toss something out here for you. Jesus talked about the man and when the demon is cast out from him and the evil spirits are cast out from him and he goes wandering out in the in the wilderness in the desert places. And that demon spirit says, "I will return to my house." &gt;&gt; Because a spirit has to have something to manifest and to work and to be animated in. &gt;&gt; I will return to my house. So we have the Holy Spirit and that is why the Holy Spirit must inhabit the individual. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is how God and the only way God can express himself, the Holy Spirit must inhabit you. &gt;&gt; And if you're going to be a true son and daughter of God, you must be filled and baptized with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; That's absolutely essential. And hol being baptized with the Holy Ghost is not a formality and it's not just a sensation. It's not that. It's a life. You become infused with the life. &gt;&gt; You have a human spirit. Where did you get it? It came into your body. When you took your first breath, as you entered out of your mother's womb, you took that breath of life in the human spirit. And whatever that whatever characteristics that spirit had, as that baby began to grow and mature, it began to uh manifest and demonstrate itself. And so, it's not only a house, but it's an inhabited house. And it speaks of the human body as an abode for the Holy Spirit. But he said, "Our earthly house of this tabernacle." And the tabernacle now is is very very rich. And I need you to hold with me on all of this. The tabernacle is a a like a tent. That's the first word. It's a tent. As the human body, this is just a tent. going to take it down someday. &gt;&gt; Or it's got to be changed to a permanent residence. &gt;&gt; You with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In which the soul dwells as in a tent which is taken down at death. But that comes also it keeps coming down to more more foundation words in the Greek. It's also as a vessel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Speaks of Apostle Paul when he was strucken down on the road to Damascus and and they and and the the the prophet local prophet said that he's a God spoke to him said he's a chosen vessel &gt;&gt; unto me. &gt;&gt; Not just a tent but a chosen vessel unto me. And the scripture in Acts 9:15, it says, "Go thy way, for he's a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the Gentiles." And then Paul said in Timothy, "If a man therefore purge himself from these," speaking of the natural fleshly things, "he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified in meat for the master's use." And the vessel, this house, this tabernacle is is not just merely a tent. It's a tent which is a temporal place, but it's also a a vessel. And a vessel also making reference to the vessels that sail the seas. They have their tackle and their and their rigging and their ropes and and uh it it speaks of a man that has chosen qualities and so on. He's a vessel unto me and to my use. He's not only a tent. He's not only a dwelling place that I will dwell in him by the Holy Spirit, but he's going to be a useful vessel. And that's why perhaps we saying the anchor holds though the ship is battered. &gt;&gt; The anchor holds though the sails are torn. &gt;&gt; Is that right? I have fallen on my knees as I face the raging seas. The anchor holds in spite of the storm. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's this anchor. &gt;&gt; And not only the anchor, but that's this vessel. &gt;&gt; We've got some rigging. We've got some ropes. We've got some tackle. &gt;&gt; And we've got some sails to make our way through &gt;&gt; stormy seas and heavy seas. Because we are a tabernacle &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; We may be here on a temporal basis. We may be here not permanently. We're moving on our way. But there's one thing sure. We're heading for a a safe shore. &gt;&gt; And then it goes just a wee bit further. This tabernacle is a shadow. A third word of the Greek has to keep coming down. I wished I had it for you on the screen, but I didn't have s enough time. It's a shadow or a shade caused by the interception of light. A shadow or an image cast. And that's why the prophet, how many times you heard brother Brandham say, I hold my hand up, &gt;&gt; but the light casts a shadow. It's it's and the shadow is a negative, &gt;&gt; confirming that there's a positive, &gt;&gt; but the closer the positive gets to the negative, they merge into one. &gt;&gt; And then we learn that this is only a negative. If the house of this tabernacle, &gt;&gt; this shadow, this tent, if it gets closer and closer to the positive, hallelujah, they just merge into one. &gt;&gt; And that's why this body shall be changed, there will be a sweep that'll go across this body and the atoms of it will change. &gt;&gt; I've got some deep things to say it. And I say deep because there are things that I have never thought of before. And brother Mark, now you'll know, Brother Mark, Sister Rachel, we were having dinner the other night and they started to and he he started to say, "Well, I we even had the book there." He said something, you know, Brother Brandham said. So I said, "Sunday morning, just remember that I already had my notes printed before we before we sat together." That's good. &gt;&gt; This image, this shadow, this negative, this is the negative. &gt;&gt; Even though this negative we can put up and say, well, here's a I I I'm I'm creating a shadow using this as a as a positive and and the shadow is a negative. But this in truth is just a shadow. &gt;&gt; This is the negative. This is the negative. This is the passing. This is the tent. &gt;&gt; This is the shadow. &gt;&gt; And the real it's only this is only here because you have a real &gt;&gt; that's near you. And the prophet now you have to step into a prophetic ministry and he calls it a theophony. &gt;&gt; You have a real word body. &gt;&gt; The first Adam that was created a spirit man. You skipped by that. We all came by a natural sexual birth. But there's one that God made. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "But when we pass from here, we go immediately." One breath. You're one breath away. He said, "You have it beside you." &gt;&gt; Your doctor can't tell you that. The pharmacist can't. No one else can tell you that. Most preachers can't tell you that. But that's what speaks in the message. A prophet message tells you you have you have it &gt;&gt; and it happens to be the reality &gt;&gt; and it's not going to get older. &gt;&gt; It's not going to get gray hair. It's not going to lose its hair. It's not going to get stooped shoulders. It's not going to have short breath. It's eternal. And you have it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Every son and daughter of God has it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the first man, Adam, let me just now go back a wee bit, was a spirit man. He was in the very image of God. Let us make man in our image and after our likeness. And the Bible says, "And so God made man in his image." And brother Brandham said as he walked through the garden of Eden first first as a theophony like the Holy Spirit is here now walking in here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now it is deep. It is deep. &gt;&gt; You can't think and figure out and calculate how this Holy Spirit is walking through here. &gt;&gt; Amen. But at this very moment, the Holy Spirit is saying one thing to this person here, another thing to this man, another thing to this girl and this woman over here, another thing to someone else. And the same Holy Spirit, and brother Brandham says it more than one place that that Adam in his first state was given control of all of creation and the animals and so on. That's why he could even name them. He said, and he had a body. It was like he's like the Holy Spirit that guides the church now. &gt;&gt; Like the Holy Spirit directs the church now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are animal. &gt;&gt; I learned that in school even back then that we're mammal. I'm glad we got the Holy Ghost to guide these animals too. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know we're very refined and very dignified and we've learned and we're cultured and all the things, but it's just amazing what these animals can do. &gt;&gt; How they can go and kill one another for no reason at all &gt;&gt; and murder and the world is full of it and conflicts are everywhere and the earth is is is being saturated with the blood. Why? Because man outside of God is merely an animal. And as I've I have often said, don't attribute this to a pig or a dog. &gt;&gt; They live with much higher standard &gt;&gt; than many humans. &gt;&gt; Humans will give themselves over to such a degraded condition. You ought to see &gt;&gt; Well, you have seen it. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. That's why you're quiet. &gt;&gt; That's exactly the case. Without God, friends, where would you and I be? &gt;&gt; God for God forbid we even have to go there. &gt;&gt; But without God, &gt;&gt; so I'm glad for this Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; that is guiding the church today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what Adam was like in his first creation. And then there was no one to till the soil. And so God formed a body and took from him from that original creation took from him a helpmate which was Eve his wife which had a womb for his seed. But the serpent got there first &gt;&gt; and brought forth a liar and a murderer &gt;&gt; called Cain. &gt;&gt; You can never attribute that to God. &gt;&gt; Come on. And that is why God said, "I'll put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed, your seed, the serpent's seed." How scholars can miss that is more than I know. &gt;&gt; Between your seed and the seed of the woman, and the woman has no seed, and it takes a prophet with a seventh grade education because it didn't come from his education. It came from God. That kind of wisdom came from God. &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that? &gt;&gt; True. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that seed, your seed will bruise his heel, but he will bruise your head. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad we have that more than just a a knowledge, more than just an understanding. Friends, there's no there's not a purpose in the world. There isn't a reason in the world for a person to give themselves uh towards a kingdom, Satan's kingdom, because the leader of that kingdom has already been sentenced and doomed. &gt;&gt; He has a crushed head. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I'm following a leader. He's got a crushed head. &gt;&gt; Don't give yourself there. Don't go there. &gt;&gt; Let's go to a leader that is a king, &gt;&gt; the eternal king. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to one who's righteous, &gt;&gt; who's just. &gt;&gt; He will never never deny a righteous person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the very image of God. &gt;&gt; And then there was no man to till the soil. So in Genesis 2, then a body is formed. I know you all know this very well, but follow and stay with me. And he forms. We do not know how that forming took place, but we know that God created all things by his word. I'm going to drop something in. You'll have to think about it and maybe swim for a while. So now came forth man. Adam was formed out of the dust of the earth. and his wife was taken from him and then the serpent seed was introduced and God had to curse the earth. &gt;&gt; That's where it all started. Every prison, every incarcerated person, every hospital bed, every mortuary and every gravestone is represented there. And God cursed the serpent. He did not curse the woman or the man. But there were aspects of their life. And the woman because she had received that seed. You will conceive in sorrow and bring forth children in pain and you will multiply and you'll bring forth. And that's what it all had to do. And with the man, he cursed the earth because the man had to be the provider. And the earth is cursed and it'll bring forth thorns and thistles and stickers and all kinds of things. And now the earth because of this cursed environment. And then now the woman is carrying not one seed but two seeds. And the bodies of those boys are coming from a cursed earth, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And they come and they immediately begin to once you're born, they begin to die. They may live for hundreds of years, but their bodies, as your bodies, hello, &gt;&gt; your physical bodies have come from a cursed earth. You're made of that. &gt;&gt; But now God began to speak out of the cursed earth. his words &gt;&gt; from his his ordained mouthpieces, &gt;&gt; sons and daughters of God, &gt;&gt; who were living in a who who their physical being was of the cursed earth and they came by a a sexual birth which was not the not the way that God had ordained it. It was a secondary way. &gt;&gt; And they begin to speak of a coming of redemption. Amen. &gt;&gt; Out of the position in being in a cursed body, &gt;&gt; a body of cursed material, shall I say, &gt;&gt; a body that was, are you with me? &gt;&gt; But out of their mouth, they begin to confess &gt;&gt; that which was a reality. &gt;&gt; And things they didn't understand. And the scripture says that the prophets they searched what manner and what manner of time it was that the of the sufferings of Christ and the glory which should follow because they were seeing somehow aspects and different facets of redemption. And while they were in a cursed earth, a cursed position not unlike us today because there was something in them that was saying there is another home. [Music] There is another place because they begin to see that there was jealousy and hatred and pride and men became enemies and they fought one with another, brother against brother, family against family and there was something in them saying surely this is not the way it's supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Something in them was saying there's got to be something different than this. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's something in you and I that are here today and we see all the religious world and all the uh bickering and all of the strife and the world and the politics and the nations and everything else and there's something in us that says surely this isn't the way it is. &gt;&gt; Go out into your street. Walk down your street. Go down Robson Street. go down Davy Street. &gt;&gt; We had brothers in the police that said they didn't even want to get out out of their car. These are men. These are policemen with guns and weapons and spray and handcuffs and everything else. They don't want to get out in the streets of Vancouver. &gt;&gt; And every city is the same. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God declares the absolute truth. Every every political system is of the devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's going that direction. &gt;&gt; And you might as well say amen to it &gt;&gt; because that's already a voice in the heavens. &gt;&gt; It's already been said and that's the way it is. &gt;&gt; And this is a cursed earth &gt;&gt; and God's going to renovate it. &gt;&gt; God's going to destroy it, but keep the framework. &gt;&gt; He's going to bring a reign of righteousness and holiness. And so these men spake of their own &gt;&gt; redemption. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Stay with me now. &gt;&gt; They actually declared their own resurrection &gt;&gt; out of a cursed body of earth. The earth was cursed and their their mothers ate the food and your mother ate food and your body is decrepit and shall go back to dust again. &gt;&gt; But for those redeemed, &gt;&gt; those who believe. &gt;&gt; And that's the difference, friends. You're either a believer or an unbeliever. For those that believe. &gt;&gt; And for those that believe, they don't have to be convinced every day. They don't have to be propped up every day. They simply believe it. &gt;&gt; They believe it in spite of everything they see. They believe it in spite of everything that happens to them. We just believe it. &gt;&gt; And those apostles or rather the seers and prophets and sages of they just believed it. And the Bible says of Abraham, Abram, and God appeared to Abram and told him, "Leave your country. Leave your kindred. &gt;&gt; Those that's what he could see. That's what he was attached to. That's what he was emotionally attached to. &gt;&gt; Leave this &gt;&gt; and go to a land that I will show you." And that's exactly where we are today as Abraham's children. We've had to leave. We've had to make decisive decisions, conscious decisions. I'm done with the world. I'm done with my old life. I'm done with my friends. I'm done with that. I separate myself and I set my face towards the country. Where is it? I'm not exactly sure, &gt;&gt; but it's a land he said he will show me. And there's something in here that says there that land is a reality. [Music] &gt;&gt; And I'm on my way. &gt;&gt; Not knowing where we go. &gt;&gt; Not knowing what the future holds, but I'm on my way. &gt;&gt; It's going to be up to whoever called me. &gt;&gt; And I believe in the God that called me. &gt;&gt; I believe in the God of this message. I believe in the God of the prophet that spoke future home. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So he gave this body as a dwelling place. And here we are today. I'm getting a little ahead of myself, but I must just follow along. Here you are in this state, in this condition. And remember the cursed earth brought brought forth stickers, thorns and thistles. And that's why the prophet says we will always have &gt;&gt; that sticky nature &gt;&gt; because we've got this. He says in in the future home, he says our your soul is redeemed now &gt;&gt; and your body will be redeemed with the earth. &gt;&gt; God is going to renovate this earth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you don't go by way of death, he said death will take you there. &gt;&gt; But if you don't go by way of death, you will have to be changed. &gt;&gt; And that change is equal to what happens at death. &gt;&gt; When you're changed, you'll arrive in another body in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. &gt;&gt; Oh, what an ultimate victory. &gt;&gt; This is what Jesus suffered for. This is why he died. And so you have to ponder this a wee bit. And so here were these men, men like you and I. Men who had infirmities and men who had weaknesses. Moses &gt;&gt; type of Christ. &gt;&gt; Samuel type of Christ. Isaac. Abraham. Isaac, Jacob, &gt;&gt; Joseph, &gt;&gt; all a perfect type of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not not all a perfect type, but a type of Christ. Christ who was perfect. Brother Brandham says Joseph was perfection, but he did have a little scratch. &gt;&gt; Nobody was without a scratch. &gt;&gt; And some of us have more &gt;&gt; than others. &gt;&gt; But that's fine. &gt;&gt; It'll be done away with. Well, should I just give up, brother Bisc? No, don't give up. Let that which is real in your soul rise up and take control over the body. Let that which is in your soul take control of your emotions &gt;&gt; and take control of the body, the physical being &gt;&gt; and we go where we ought to go and do not go where we should not go because the Holy Spirit from within is guiding us, &gt;&gt; guiding our speaking, &gt;&gt; guiding our confession. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But yet it'll still have a sticky nature because it came of a cursed earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so now comes the most unique being that ever walked. And a virgin, Mary said to the angel, "Be it unto me according to your word." &gt;&gt; And the Bible says details, now you've heard me say it before, but I have to say it in this context. It details all the details of the birth of Christ. And then the Bible says in in Matthew the 2 chapter, all this was done, every detail of the birth of Christ, all of this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of uh spoken of the Lord by the prophets. So the prophets literally spoke. &gt;&gt; You with me? &gt;&gt; They literally spoke the body of Jesus Christ into existence. &gt;&gt; Now you have to think about that. &gt;&gt; It was God's word. &gt;&gt; It's not the prophet's word. It's God's word. &gt;&gt; And God called forth the second Adam out of the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he took a body. &gt;&gt; Mary &gt;&gt; ate grain and wheat and things that grew out of the soil and issued into the world. &gt;&gt; A man child. The Bible says a man child. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But in him was God. So part of that conception there was the flesh part which was man. He would be hungry as you get hungry. He would sweat when you got hot. He had every He was tempted in all points as we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to me young man. Jesus was your age. &gt;&gt; He knows exactly. And the same devil that speaks to you spoke to him. &gt;&gt; He was your age. &gt;&gt; He knows everything about it. &gt;&gt; And when he came to his manhood and 30 years old, he begins a ministry and he begins to take this body. But the but the the the spirit part of him was God. &gt;&gt; So he was man very man and he was God very God. &gt;&gt; And he took &gt;&gt; that's why we can identify him. He took that cursed body to Calvary. &gt;&gt; He took and brought the earth body into full subjection &gt;&gt; to show to us it can be done. and he took it to Calvary. &gt;&gt; You still want me to keep on preaching? &gt;&gt; And he aged like you age. &gt;&gt; In fact, is he aged prematurely &gt;&gt; because when he was 30, he looked like he was 50. &gt;&gt; And the Pharisees said, "You're not 50." And you say that you saw Abraham before Abraham was. I am. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That was a spirit part. &gt;&gt; He was God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He could speak to the wind and speak to the waves and he could speak to the tree. Let no fruit be born on you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Demonstrating and showing what a son of God a restored position. But he took that body, brought the earth into absolute subjection to the spirit of God that was in him. God was in Christ. reconciling the world to himself. Listen friends, he didn't do it for himself. He did it for you sitting here today. &gt;&gt; And he takes it to Calvary and he's able to say, "No man, &gt;&gt; takes my life from me. I lay it down and I will take it up again." &gt;&gt; That body had to listen to him. and he took it to the tomb. And out from the tomb came a a a person, a being that could eat fish, broil fish and honey, and pass through a wall, a physical wall. It was the same Christ &gt;&gt; in another form &gt;&gt; showing to us that there is another form &gt;&gt; and it's a real form &gt;&gt; and you can take it and handle it and shake hands. Feel me, touch melle. &gt;&gt; The spirit hath not flesh and bones such as I have. Do you see the reality of it, friends? &gt;&gt; And now here we are. He's demonstrating all through the scriptures that these bodies, they can have stickers, they can have weaknesses, they can have frailties. And your enemy, he has only one thing in mind. Condemn you for your weaknesses. &gt;&gt; And God only has one thing in mind. And that is deny that liar. &gt;&gt; Deny him. He has no good intent for you. He has no good plan for you. deny the unbeliever and believe. &gt;&gt; Believe the promise. &gt;&gt; And so now we were speaking that there's a great voice in heaven and the voice of the uh the voice of the prophets, the voice of the righteous, the voice of the apostles, the voice of the messengers, and the voice of the messenger of this time. But I want to add another voice. to the heavens. Listen to me. I'm not speaking some mystical stuff. I want you to add your voice &gt;&gt; to the heavens. &gt;&gt; And let's say here and let's agree here today. There's a great voice in the heavens. &gt;&gt; And at at at at that day when I stand before him, I shall hear my voice in full agreement with his voice. I will hear my voice saying what my prophet said. I will hear my voice declaring by confession exactly what he said. &gt;&gt; You think these are little phrases? You know what he says? Say &gt;&gt; what the tape says. &gt;&gt; Say it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you'll hear it again. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't want to stand up there and say, "Well, I don't know about that. I think that's just what the preacher thinks." You'll hear it. &gt;&gt; Oh, I think you know all those unbelievers that all those criti criticizers that stood there, they'll stand there while Brother Brandham stands there. &gt;&gt; When that pillar of fire was staying with him all the time, and the angel of the Lord who is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ himself on the platform. Can you imagine being in that presence and those men hearing their voices saying I think that's his own idea. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; He ought to just stay with the gift and let leave the teaching up to us. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine hearing that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And that's what they will hear. You think that's my imagination? That's what the scripture teaches us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why am I preaching with such fervor? Because these things need to be made known. In this season, &gt;&gt; say what he said. &gt;&gt; You may not understand it any more than Abraham knew where he was going. He didn't know where he was going. That's irrelevant. He could say, "I heard from God and this is what he told me to do and I'm on my way. And that's all you need to say. &gt;&gt; Do you understand it? No, I don't fully understand it. I don't understand everything about this way, but I have a calling within me. And I'm going to come to that now. [Music] &gt;&gt; And add your voice &gt;&gt; is what I'm saying to you. In the name of Jesus Christ, add your voice. &gt;&gt; Don't add your doubts. &gt;&gt; Don't add your criticism. &gt;&gt; Don't add your evil things. at your voice that someday I want to hear this again. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've given it a lot of thought, friend, when I was ready to say something &gt;&gt; and I asked myself, do I want to hear this again? &gt;&gt; And I agree with my own self, I don't want to hear it again, so I don't say it. [Music] &gt;&gt; You aren't going to hear it again &gt;&gt; unless you say, "Lord, forgive me. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry I said that. Forgive me. and let the blood &gt;&gt; wash it away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How How many are thankful for the blood of Jesus Christ? Of course we are. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Even then, if you didn't raise your hand, you should raise it now cuz you'll see that act again. Also, if you didn't raise it, raise it now. [Music] And that's why he was called the beginning, the beginning of the creation of God. In the message, he must be born again. He says, "Then came in sin. Then in came sin, and sin marred the picture." This just kind of gives a review of it. But sin can't stop the purpose of God. I &gt;&gt; if these things mean something to you, often when I'm sitting in the seat behind in a minister's ministering and I hear him saying something and quoting the prophet of God, quoting the scripture, I will say it with him because I want my own soul &gt;&gt; to emphasize that. &gt;&gt; And you should say with me, but sin can't stop the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Let's say it together. But sin can't stop the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; And now we can say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have an enemy. He wants to stop it. &gt;&gt; He wants to hinder you. &gt;&gt; He wants to make your life miserable. But sin can't stop the purpose of God. Believe that [Music] &gt;&gt; God will not be defeated. &gt;&gt; Say that with me. God will not be defeated. And the people said, "Praise God." &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; God will not be defeated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We may miss the mark or fail sometime along the way, but God will not be defeated. And we're God's children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; He says, "Because sin came in, the woman brought forth man, which was secondary, a perverted way." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A perverted way. God never created him out of the dust of the earth with his own hands. But woman had brought him through sex. &gt;&gt; Same way we came. &gt;&gt; It was a secondary way. And that's why we have the struggles we have. But God's not going to leave you in this state. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God's children. Can you just imagine? Try to turn your mind loose and break the barriers down and think of a place in the city where the lamb is the light &gt;&gt; in the city. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where divine light. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Then what happened where we where we make our bodies from the dust of the earth, the calcium," he says, "the lumber, that pot ash that God had laying out is still being used. One day, the last bit of it will be used up." &gt;&gt; And that's right, the lumber pile will go down, but God still makes man from the dust of the earth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you come on this earth without having any reason, any way you uh no way at all you had of bringing yourself here. God brought you here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are not an accidental birth. &gt;&gt; God brought you here. &gt;&gt; And that's why he caused his message, his message by the Holy Spirit to come your way. You're sitting here this morning because God wants you here. [Music] Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You may not have even been able to make certain meetings to the past, but God has you here because he wants you to hear this service. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why doesn't the believing congregation say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That means so be it. But by the sexual birth, we skipped around. &gt;&gt; We skipped around the other one. &gt;&gt; That original man, the one God had in his mind. In fact, is when he had in his mind said, "Let us make man." I don't think it's speaking of one man. &gt;&gt; Let us make man &gt;&gt; in our image. God had in his mind his family. That's I can tell you that because all through the scriptures, he calls out for his family. &gt;&gt; He goes out to Abraham and I'm going to give you a seed and you're going to be the father of nations and there's going to be people and my people going to go into bondage and after many years they're going to come out. &gt;&gt; That's God's program. &gt;&gt; God has a nation. God has a people. God has a family. God's purpose cannot be defeated. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's already got in his mind a marriage table, a marriage supper. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's going to receive you as his wife. &gt;&gt; He sent a messenger in this time to tell you all about the bride. &gt;&gt; This is the first bride message I know of. &gt;&gt; Your bride, friends. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is more. This is not just church. &gt;&gt; This is not Bible way. That has nothing to do with it. is the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we skipped around that. He says he was the word. And a theophony is something. Now a theophony. You have a theophony. And a theophony is something you could not see. It could be here right now. Yet you cannot see it. &gt;&gt; And the best way that he the prophet of God in this generation could describe it and he could only use that description because we had got there in the countdown in the development of of science. He said it's like television &gt;&gt; going through the room and you've heard it many times but now you need to hear it in reference to this service going through this room right now is colors &gt;&gt; and voices. &gt;&gt; He says bodies &gt;&gt; are passing through and what television will do is catch the signal and channel it. They do not create the colors. &gt;&gt; The colors might be over in Italy &gt;&gt; or in China or some other country, &gt;&gt; but it will simply channel what is here going through the room. &gt;&gt; There's voices going through the room. There's all kinds of messages. There's all kinds of texting that's going through the room. and you have a certain you can have a cell phone or some other uh piece of equipment that can pick it up &gt;&gt; and it will tell you exactly what's going through the room. &gt;&gt; I had an experience which some of you know about. I've said it before, but I'll just say it very quickly. I was preaching in in Norway at a convention and and and made those same statement. I said, "There's voices going through the room." And they had uh they had cameras there, video cameras, and some equipment that was taking place. And when they went to when they went to rehear this because they were going to duplicate it, right? As I said, and there's voices going through the room, a series of other voices started coming through the room &gt;&gt; and there was several languages. There was Russian, &gt;&gt; there was English, &gt;&gt; and there was another two or three languages that were on that tape, &gt;&gt; and the one they made some inquiry because this is it wasn't a garble thing. They made some inquiry because it was so clear. And it was a radio station in Texas that' been off the air for about 50 years. &gt;&gt; Where was the voice? &gt;&gt; And so they inquired about it and said, "Well, how will this happen?" And they said, "Well, it can go into some, you know, to some distant place and and bounce off of some satellite, bounce off of some planet and come back to the Earth." And that's obviously what they picked up. &gt;&gt; You think these voices aren't up there? There's a great voice in heaven &gt;&gt; and it's also the voice of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; When you said, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; have your way. When you said, "Oh father, I give myself to you." You'll hear it again. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I am thine, oh Lord. I've heard thy voice and told thy love to me, but I long to rise on the wings of faith and be closer drawn to thee. Maybe others were just singing a tune, but you were singing, "Draw me nearer. draw me nearer. &gt;&gt; Go and listen to Future Home. Go to the end. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon begins to sing the old song. I'm bound for that beautiful city &gt;&gt; the Lord has prepared for his own where all the redeemed of all ages sing glory around the white throne sometimes in his voice breaks I get homesick for heaven and the joys that I'll behold what a joy it will be when my Savior, I see &gt;&gt; in that city, &gt;&gt; beautiful city of gold. &gt;&gt; And then he begins to weep. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's a reality. It's not just a song. It's not just a tune. It's not just a melody. It's a reality. &gt;&gt; And we all get homesick. Why do you get homesick? Because there's something in here calling for it. Is that the lights &gt;&gt; of whom I see? &gt;&gt; Do I see you? I feel a breeze from the crystal sea. Is that the Lord standing high on heaven's balcony? If that's the lights of home, it's a precious sight to me. &gt;&gt; You skipped around your eternal home. Says he was he was a theophony, something that you could not see but could be here right now. And he just says it's in another dimension. It's like television. And it's in another dimension. People are moving through this room now singing colors. Also, your whole being is only subject to five senses. Your being is subject to five senses. You see, you taste, you smell, you hear, and you feel, only subject to five senses. And you are only subject to what the sight has been limited to see. But there is, you're only limited by what the sight is permitted to see. But there is another dimension that can be seen by the transformation of television by television. He says now television does not manufacture the picture. It only channels it into a circuit and then the television picks uh the television screen picks it up but the picture's there to begin with. &gt;&gt; Your theophony is there to begin with. &gt;&gt; It's another realm. It's another channel, but it's here. And I'm preaching to see to have you to believe it &gt;&gt; with everything that's in you. &gt;&gt; I want you to say, "I believe in that more than I believe in this." Because this is passing away, but that will not pass away. &gt;&gt; It's your inheritance. Reach out and take it. &gt;&gt; Television was here when Adam was here. It was here when Elijah was here. He said &gt;&gt; when he was on Mount Carmel, it was here when Jesus was here &gt;&gt; and walked the shores of G. Isn't it amazing? Television was here when Jesus was here. You never hear of it in the Bible. Why? It wasn't for that season, but it's for this season because it's no shock to you. It's a no-brainer for you. You understand it. He said they couldn't have believed it back then because it would have went over their head. It wasn't that God couldn't reveal it, but it's beyond them. But it's not beyond you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And someday now follow &gt;&gt; God's messenger sent to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Follow it close. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The angels. And so he said they wouldn't have believed it back then. They wouldn't have believed television. But now God's teleision &gt;&gt; in a prophet form. &gt;&gt; It's telling the people about another dimension. &gt;&gt; It's not the idol, American Idol or the Canadian Idol or some other thing on television. It's not I Love Lucy or the CNN or anything else. It's not that. But it's a prophet who saw far beyond those channels. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen folks, I'm going to preach. &gt;&gt; I want you, especially you kids, you listen. This is your generation. God's going to hold me may not hold me accountable, but he's going to hold you accountable. Going to hold you accountable for this generation. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching not because I have to preach. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching because I'm a burden man. &gt;&gt; You're going to be here. You're going to see it. You're going to enter into it. And this message came for you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't have believed it back then. But you can believe it today. They couldn't have even understood it back then. You can understand it today. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the church in its development &gt;&gt; and science and its development have gone hand in hand. And that's why the church, the science and its development have put the heavens have filled it full of sounds that now for the first time we can retrieve and bring back the prophet's message. You can hear brother Brandham's voice. You can't hear Elijah's voice because they hadn't developed it back then. &gt;&gt; But Elijah's voice is there the same as Jesus voice is there the same as Paul's voice is there. And William Brandham's voice is there. &gt;&gt; And it should mean something more to you when they comes and the first thing we have on tape. We have these new gadgets. &gt;&gt; Recording gadgets. &gt;&gt; A God's prophet. The first thing he tells us is they got these recording gadgets. Just a casual statement. It's not a casual statement. He's announcing to you these things will be recorded. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this whole world will be judged by that voice. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's not his voice. It's thus sayaith the Lord. [Music] And he says, "And so as television is here that we can that we just think, well, Brother Ed, we've heard that so many times that's just, you know, let's get on with the message." Okay, we'll get on with it. And so are angels here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see them? &gt;&gt; You can't reach out these five senses and feel them. You're Joseph and you're here. So are the angels here. &gt;&gt; I can't feel it just like that because that's one of my five senses. &gt;&gt; I felt you. I can speak to you. I can hear you. I can see you. So are the angels here. But the prophet said something further that is blessing and you can feel the influence. You can't see them but you can feel the influence of them. &gt;&gt; They're trying to move us to be believers. &gt;&gt; Believe on it. &gt;&gt; Believe on it. &gt;&gt; And so is Christ here. Jesus of Nazareth who walked with Jordan of Galilee is here in this building. Here right now. Not in some spooky way. He's here in this building if you can believe it. &gt;&gt; And by him all things are possible. &gt;&gt; I tell you my friends, it becomes a little bit scary because we could believe for things we're almost afraid to believe for. &gt;&gt; And so are angels here. &gt;&gt; Angels just some big crowd. No, your angel, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The one that was stood by your mother, your mother's bedside when you came into the world, that angel. &gt;&gt; And it's before the face of the father. &gt;&gt; So, he's not far away. &gt;&gt; And he watched over you and brought you to this time. &gt;&gt; And he preserved you so you could hear this service. and he came with you into this church. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; What a message. &gt;&gt; And so is Christ here. And to prove it, then he just reached into that dimension and told you what was happening and told you what people told people what they did years ago. That's right. &gt;&gt; I think of one woman that came before him and he was so conscious and so kind and so considerate and know she had suffered and she'd been to doctors and doctors and doctors and he said, "You've been to doctors and they couldn't find it. They couldn't find what was wrong." And he moves away and he quietly says, "Can I say it?" and she gave her consent. He said, "When you were a little girl, I think about 8 years old. Do we have an 8-year-old girl here? Anybody ate?" Nobody ate. Eight. Right there. When she was about your age, she fell down a well. Can you imagine a man in public telling what somebody did maybe 40 years ago? When you were a girl, you fell down a well. And when you fell down the well, it loosened your organs. It loosened them. And they've operated and they never could find it. &gt;&gt; But a prophet found it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's in another channel. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God is that concerned about an individual and tell them what happened when they were 8 years old. &gt;&gt; He knew you. You older people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I remember my youth and I go much over my youth in these days and I think about it. You know why? Because I see God's hand &gt;&gt; back there guiding you and something inside of you calling out. And now help me. &gt;&gt; Before you could call out, he says this, before you could have a cry in your heart, now I'm coming down to what is that cry? He said, before you can have that cry within, there has to be a reality. There has to be the real out there that's calling to you. &gt;&gt; So my service today, friends, is home is calling. &gt;&gt; Home is calling. Amen. &gt;&gt; In fact is brother Brandham says this. I've got all these quotes but I can't go on with it. You you listen to what he says. He says that like it is in the natural when you were in your mother's womb. Your mother got a craving. He said maybe for cantaloupe or something else. And some of you women that have carried children know what it is. You got a craving for pickles or and strange stuff. But he explains it. I even went on to Google to see what the world thinks about it. The prophet is so far beyond Google, they don't even know where they're which end is up. &gt;&gt; And great scholars and scientists and everything else. He puts it in one phrase. You in your mother's womb was calling for something &gt;&gt; and that's why she had this craving. And she craved strange stuff because you needed it. Your body was calling for it. &gt;&gt; And if you say today, you know what, brother Ed's message today is like a pickle. &gt;&gt; Well, you just thank God for the pickle &gt;&gt; because it's your body out there that's calling for it. You need what you're hearing to go there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not here to win any brownie points or anything. We're just here to speak what God makes real. And this is so real to me, friend. So real. And he takes that he takes that perfect analogy and says a mother when she's carrying a child, she'll crave for something and the father will go and do whatever. He'll squeeze the pennies and whatever to get it for her because you're calling for it. And likewise, your heavenly home, &gt;&gt; your heavenly home, your home is calling for it. And he says, "And he will send a preacher to the pullpit to preach what you need to hear." &gt;&gt; Don't blame Don't blame me for this service. It's your fault. [Music] [Applause] Your body's calling for Hallelujah. I've been feeding on it all week. &gt;&gt; I've been feeding out all week cuz my body needed it. &gt;&gt; And now I'm here to speak it out to you cuz your body needs it. &gt;&gt; You needed to get there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You need to You need now to confess and put up into the heavens. I believe that &gt;&gt; and I want to hear on that day Lord Jesus saying I believe your word. I believe your messenger. I believe the man who spoke it &gt;&gt; because it's thus say the Lord according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Just is that all right with John? Good. He was preaching about the house at home. So I just felt to take it a little different direction. Now we'll just read these quickly. Now we see the attribute sons of his spirit not yet entered into the word body word form body but a theophony. He said this body is subject to the word and waiting for the earnest change of the body. &gt;&gt; Melzdc went to meet Abraham before he got back home. What a beautiful type. Here we have Melchzdc &gt;&gt; who was a theophony. We know that meeting Abraham before he got back home after the battle. &gt;&gt; We meet Jesus in the air before we get home. &gt;&gt; And I'd like to tell you that this message was his appearing. &gt;&gt; He's appearing to us. He said &gt;&gt; we have met Jesus before getting home. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, we meet him in the sky." Well, wherever this guy is, I can tell you that there's another realm. There's another dimension. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we're meeting him now. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We meet Jesus in the air before we get home. Therefore, the theophony, if you have died and entered into that theophony, what happens? The theophony comes to the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; To pick up the redeemed body. &gt;&gt; And if you're in the air, you take the body to meet the theophony. &gt;&gt; There you are. And caught up and go to meet the Lord in the air. Who is this? Melisedc but God. He says in another place, this mortal body and the theophony body and the resurrected body, which is the glorified, the three of them make the glorified body your eternal home. Now look it, just listen close. Jesus said to the disciples, he said, "There are some of you that shall not see death until you see uh the kingdom of God and coming in its power." And after 6 days he taketh up Peter, James, and John three is a witness up into the mount transfiguration. And on the mountain he was transfigured before them. And on the mountain was Elijah and Moses. Elijah had been raptured. Moses had died. But all both of them were there. So there was the the rapture, the resurrection, and Jesus glorified and three witnesses of the earth. There was three there in a mortal body, one that had had a rapture, one who had died and resurrected. And Jesus glorified Mount Transfiguration. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All standing on the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is it in the skies? &gt;&gt; Where's the skies? &gt;&gt; Oh, religion and all of that. Sunday school stories have told you someplace up there and heaven's 150 million light years. Don't you believe it? A prophet said he's going to renovate this earth &gt;&gt; and you're going to live here &gt;&gt; and you'll travel like a thought. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One woman came to the old brother. He didn't have the message such as we have it. But the old brother that led me into the ministry and she came to him and she said, "Brother McFraf, is there going to be any horses in heaven?" And he didn't have the message, but he says, "Well, I don't know." He said, "If there if we don't," he says, "we'll just create a few." Says, "You want them with pink polka dots or whatever kind of horse you want, we'll just create them." Cuz we, he says, we're going to be like him. that one thing he knew uh we're going to be like him and he's a creator and so we have to be like him. &gt;&gt; That was his solution. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And caught up to meet the Lord in the air. Who is this Melzdc? But God. &gt;&gt; Our own life is just a pattern. It's just a shadow. Look at yourself. You can't right now, but look at your neighbor. your shadow neighbor. Some are going to say, "Wow, I wish I was a shadow." But we're just shadow and not the real thing. Hello, brother. Not the real thing. A friend of mine, excuse me, he was in Alaska and he played the bass fiddle and he was there with Brother McGriff and his son and they were on the platform playing and he was very, very shy. And so they're saying and the pastor said, "Now we want these people to introduce themselves." And so brother McGriff said who he was and Norman said who he was. And this brother, very dear friend of mine, used to be a a deacon in my church. He was just terribly shy. And he kind of hid behind the the big bass fiddle. He says, "It don't matter." And the people laughed because they knew him. Some of the people knew him. So they laughed. His name was Vern. And so they laughed and and he said, "Don't laugh." He said, "That's just fine, brother. Don't matter. That does, you know, we've heard stranger names and that or whatever." And he just thought that that was his name. Don't matter. Well, Brother Brandham says, "We're not the real thing." How are you, brother? Not the real thing. Hallelujah. But you do have a real thing. You have a real body. You have a real place. You have a real home. And guess what? Home is calling, folks. &gt;&gt; That's why you're in the season that you're in. Home is calling. out on the internet. Home is calling. &gt;&gt; Is that the lights of home? &gt;&gt; Is that the voice &gt;&gt; that I hear? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; From heaven's balcony. Oh, that's the lights of home. &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful thing. It's a wonderful sight to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; It takes death to develop the picture &gt;&gt; to put us back in the theophony we come from. Then in the resurrection, we come in his likeness, a resurrected body. What a beautiful, not only beautiful, but it's the real solemn truth of God's eternal word. Hallelujah. Isn't that wonderful, friends &gt;&gt; to be in that season? &gt;&gt; We're not here for a long time, &gt;&gt; but we should be here for a wonderful time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, I need you up here, Brother Derek. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. God bless you. Hallelujah. Amen. The reason why I want you to enjoy it is cuz I'm enjoying it. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Wes. &gt;&gt; Dian Nyard, &gt;&gt; Zach, young lady, Jessica. &gt;&gt; I'm sure you're all happy &gt;&gt; that dad is still here. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] We're not done yet, brother Wes. &gt;&gt; Something yet to do. &gt;&gt; Some reflection &gt;&gt; of our Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; that only you can do &gt;&gt; because you've been chosen to reflect him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But don't we appreciate God's sons and daughters? &gt;&gt; Appreciate you. Appreciate you young people. Appreciate it with all my heart. Hallelujah. I say go for it. &gt;&gt; Go for the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I was younger than most of you when I still had that same fire and same zeal. And I can tell you it never needs to go out. The flame never needs to go out. Do what you can. Wherever you can and make the right confession. If you make your mistakes and you fall down, don't stay there. The prophet said you'll get up. A son of God will get up &gt;&gt; and go for it right away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. My &gt;&gt; Oh, we love love love to have that kind of response. &gt;&gt; Do we can we sing that? Uh is that the lights of home? I see. Give Brother Ryan some volume two. We're not making a special out of this. We're just singing a song. Chorus first. [Music] Is that the light of all my sea? Do I feel free from the crystal sea? Is that the door standing high on me? If that's the light of my soul rise up, my soul cries out. Oh Lord, how long till my hand and you call me home [Music] to catch it. [Music] I this world keeps me all I see I feel from the crystal Is that the Lord stand behind [Music] me? Seems I can't hear. Here we are right here. The angels sing with hearts of gold and a thousand stra [Music] [Applause] [Music] my We [Music] all see I feel free from the grace. [Music] Is that the Lord's day? I am aly. I see. You might feel the breeze from that sea. The Lord [Music] has a beautiful [Music] that beautiful city the Lord has prepared for his own. for all the redeemed of the ages. How many were able to hear prophet of God saying that? Oh, thank you. God bless you. Wasn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; I just felt could not finish this service without singing a verse or two. I'm bound for that beautiful city my Lord has prepared for his own where all the redeemed of the ages. Sing glory around the white throne. Sometimes I go home singing for heaven. And the glory I there shall behold. What a joy that will be when with my Savior I see in that beautiful city of gold. I'm bound for that beautiful sea. My Lord has prepared for his soul. We're all redeemed of all ages. Sing glory around the white. Sometimes I sing for heaven. The glory I see. What a joy that will be when my Savior I see in that beautiful city of you know many of you we don't have much time down here to visit to see one another but there'll be a day is coming when we'll not get weary and we won't have other appointments and we'll be able uh speak about the glorious things that God has done. I wonder brother brother West could you pray for us? [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come here. want to hug you. Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Say a word. Say a word if you wish, please. [Music] Bless you. First off, let me say how blessed we are and how blessed I am to be here &gt;&gt; and how thankful for the word that we have heard and received. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, [Music] &gt;&gt; I thank God primarily for that that he saw fit to bring me here and bring me back here to bring me his word to manifest his word in me and to see it in this day and age. &gt;&gt; If I can do this, um, I want to thank the ministry. I want to thank God for having his hand upon me. Um, I'm a miracle. &gt;&gt; Um, &gt;&gt; praise God. [Music] &gt;&gt; I stand here as a miracle of God's healing hand and as a testimony and as a miracle of your prayers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to thank the ministry. I don't know how Brother Ed made it so quick down to Bellingham. I want to thank God for my family, for a wife. She's doing everything. For my family that know how bullheaded I am that got me into the hospital. Um I'm a miracle. Um, &gt;&gt; I have been told by uh doctors, by physical therapist, "Wow, what a surprise. You're a miracle. Things aren't going fast enough for me, but they're going great." Especially when the right side of my body was a chunk of meat. [Music] I checked in the hospital. Blood pressure 217 over 138. And they couldn't get it down. Wow. They pumped so much stuff into me. I thought, how much more can my body take? I have no idea how brother Ed made it so quick down there. My son, my wife were there and they're a comfort. But there's something about your pastor being there. Amen. &gt;&gt; What a comfort. So, I think I had about eight or 10 IOS thrown into me to get my blood pressure down and it wouldn't come down. I'm going, "Wow, that's interesting." I saw a man of God pray and probably uh 5 seconds 3 to five and they took the cough off said 110 get them out of here. They were waiting for it to get down to 110 and it wouldn't go there. 130 135 wow this is interesting. I can assure you that somebody was in control not me. Amen. &gt;&gt; The hand of God was there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I covet your prayers. I thank you for your prayers. Each and every one of them, the phone calls, the uh &gt;&gt; you have no concept about the strength. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Um Brother Ken came down and prayed for me. He said, and in his prayer, he said, "Thank you, God, for the thousands of people around the world that are praying for you. And I thank you from China to brother Ron's church to brother Lance's to just my brother Ddier and brother Ddier sent message with sister Barbara Graham saying hey we're he sent some kind words and said we're praying for you it's the prayers and the prayers of a righteous man avaleth much righteous sister um it's not going quick enough for me but my wife said wow if you could have seen yourself when you're in the hospital but I stand before you as a miracle But you have no concept the number of miracles that have occurred. &gt;&gt; I mean it just for my blood pressure going down, brother Ed wouldn't go down. A man of God praise and it goes &gt;&gt; to were walking and I hope Am I taking too much time, Brother Ed? Am I taking too much time? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Okay. Just a just to kind of skip over the miracles as quick as I could to touch a couple of them. Brother Ed made it down and he prays. My blood pressure goes down and so they take me into the ICU and I'm laying on this gurnie and on a venture I've never been on before in my life. And all a sudden my wife is next to me and I hear this word this song. I'm going I'm not dead. And then sister Arlene Weston [Music] My wife had her iPhone in her pocket. Now you talk about odd things happening. [Music] Sorry. Her cell phone turns on. Thank you. And Hog goes from the phone to the music to find Sister Arling Weston. I know she's been married. I don't know her maiden or her new name, but it's uh we're going into ICU and it's she pulls it out and like I said, I didn't think I was dead, but it's greater works than these. And she pulls it out and she turns up the volume and we're walking down the hall. Poor guy pushing the gurnie must have thought, what's with these people? And the lady in the ICU, the head nurse kind of goes, what's going on? are walking down the hall and our sister Arlene Weston is singing greater works than these. Wow. So, the miracles on top of miracles on top of miracles and brother Ken, you've put me into a guilt trip. I had a thousands of people praying for me when I'm laying on my back doing my my physical therapy myself. My ankle doesn't turn and I'm &gt;&gt; I got to think I've got thousands of people around the world praying for me and you lifted me up. You know, uh, Brother Tom and Brother John came down and I was so proud the day before. I think I touched my finger. I couldn't do it the next day. Exhausting. But the strength of the prayer is what brought me through. And we've heard time and time again, even last week, I went to my general doctor and he said, "What's happened to you?" You're a no, excuse me. He said, "From what? What happened to you? You're doing incredible." went to the neuro the neurologist and the neurologist took a look and said, "Wow, you can walk. You're this is a miracle." And he looked at my eyes and he said, "Wow." He said, "Usually where people have a stroke in this portion of the brain, they're crosseyed." I'm not crosseyed. I can see my brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; So, uh, that's just a few of the miracles. I'm sorry. I just had to go ahead and say &gt;&gt; your prayers. your prayers. &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; the greatest thing of all is the word that we've received for this hour. &gt;&gt; And I'm here and brother Raphael gave me a call and he said, like you said this morning, Brother Ed, he brother Wes, he said, God has something more for you to do. He gave me my arm and you have no idea how great it is to be able to raise your arm &gt;&gt; and praise the Lord. [Applause] [Music] When this chunk of meat here doesn't move, you have no idea how great it is to be able to get back down on your knees and praise and pray to God. &gt;&gt; That is an honor. &gt;&gt; I stand before you as a miracle. The hand of God has touched me. He's not finished with me. He's not finished with us. Brother Cardo, &gt;&gt; Sister Shmaine, he's in the arms. He's in the legs. And I guess if the greatest thing, cuz I would probably ask my kids this, I'd say, "What have you learned from all this?" I'm sure that I'm going to learn a lot more. But I can tell you unequivocally, he loves me. &gt;&gt; He loves you &gt;&gt; more than we will ever know. and he's into everything, every aspect of our life. If we're concerned, he's concerned. And I can't tell you the with the body being whacked out the way mine was. And I was out of control. Brother Ed's holding my hand and praying for me. [Music] His hand was there. He was there. He was in that room. &gt;&gt; And he was with me. And he's with us. And he cares for me. He cares for you more than we'll ever ever know. &gt;&gt; But thank you for your prayers. Thank you, Lord, for your hand upon me. I give you all the praise and all the glory. Let's just pray.
