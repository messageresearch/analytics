[9:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to ask the
[9:51] brethren if they would just come and
[9:52] prepare for the morning offering. We're
[9:54] going to open the service with a word of
[9:57] prayer. Want to read a testimony first
[9:58] from our sister Shannon Schmoutz.
[10:02] Saying this past Friday evening, her
[10:03] oldest daughter Hannah had complained of
[10:05] pain in her stomach and she prayed for
[10:07] her and she was up
[10:10] working on art projects within a short
[10:11] amount of time. But then she was
[10:12] complaining of pain in her lower right
[10:14] abdomen that hurt to the touch. And she
[10:16] laid hands on on her and prayed once
[10:18] again. And her husband prayed as well as
[10:20] he worked. And as the evening
[10:21] progressed, the pain improved. And all
[10:22] day Saturday the pain grew less and less
[10:24] until it was entirely gone. Thank you
[10:26] Jesus for answered prayer.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:30] Hallelujah.
[10:32] Sister Joy Hayes just asked that we
[10:34] would please have prayer for her niece.
[10:35] The doctors think she has a rare blood
[10:37] disorder similar to leukemia. She has
[10:40] test scheduled on Tuesday to determine.
[10:42] Amen. So if we could remember her and
[10:44] also our brother Kyle is at home sick
[10:46] and body. And sister Violet asking will
[10:49] we please remember brother David. He is
[10:50] in the hospital. that God would just use
[10:52] this situation to minister and speak to
[10:54] his heart. Amen. Why don't we sing that
[10:57] chorus? Jesus. Jesus. There's just
[10:59] something about that name.
[11:02] Amen. Brother Tim, would you come maybe
[11:04] just open the service for us as we sing
[11:05] this song?
[11:07] Oh Jesus.
[11:09] [Music]
[11:11] Jesus.
[11:13] Jesus.
[11:18] There's just something
[11:21] about
[11:22] that
[11:26] as we sing Jesus
[11:33] Jesus
[11:36] like the
[11:38] [Music]
[11:42] rain.
[11:43] [Music]
[11:46] Oh Jesus.
[11:48] Jesus.
[11:51] Jesus.
[11:54] [Music]
[12:06] and
[12:08] will all
[12:10] pass away.
[12:15] [Music]
[12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be home.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; Shall we just approach the Lord in
[12:25] prayer?
[12:28] Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. There is truly just
[12:32] something about that name as we
[12:35] utter those
[12:38] that word that name from our lips. But
[12:40] Lord, it's more than a name. There's
[12:42] many people that are using that name
[12:45] this morning in the wrong way. There's
[12:48] some Lord that are reciting it as though
[12:50] it's some kind of creed or form. But
[12:53] Lord, we thank you that as it was in the
[12:55] logos, it's not just the word expressed.
[12:58] It's the thought behind the word. And we
[13:01] thank you Lord that we can worship you
[13:02] in spirit and in truth. That we can know
[13:05] our God and that we can see exploits
[13:08] being done oh Lord amongst your people.
[13:10] And Lord we thank you for the testimony
[13:12] this morning of Sister Schmottz and many
[13:14] things Lord that you have done in our
[13:16] midst. We give glory to the name of
[13:19] Jesus Christ. We thank you Lord for this
[13:22] opportunity Lord. Even pondering your
[13:25] word this morning Lord I will enter your
[13:28] gates with thanksgiving. I will come
[13:30] with praise saying this is the day that
[13:33] the Lord has made. We will be glad and
[13:35] rejoice in it oh God. And we thank you
[13:38] Lord for the opportunity to rejoice
[13:40] together to feed on your word to enter
[13:43] into your presence together bringing our
[13:45] licks of fire uniting our hearts and our
[13:48] minds in one accord that the spirit of
[13:50] the living God might move amongst his
[13:52] people once again. Lord there's needs in
[13:55] this place. Lord there's burdens.
[13:57] There's ones that would have prayers
[13:59] that need answer, maybe unspoken
[14:01] requests. Lord, may you move amongst the
[14:04] congregation here on the internet,
[14:06] wherever it might be, Lord. And Lord,
[14:08] may you change the onslaught of the
[14:10] enemy and cause a great defeat to the
[14:13] kingdom of darkness and a great king, a
[14:16] great victory to the kingdom of light.
[14:18] We remember these prayer requests, oh
[14:20] God. Sister Joyy's niece, Lord, we ask
[14:22] for her. We don't know her estate
[14:25] spiritually, but Lord, you're the God of
[14:28] the whole earth.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; The earth is the Lord's in the fullness
[14:32] thereof. And so, Lord, may you come to
[14:34] her. May you deal with her heart and may
[14:37] you touch her mortal body. We're asking
[14:39] him as believing people. Also for sister
[14:42] for D, brother David this morning,
[14:44] sister Violet's husband. Lord, may you
[14:47] touch his heart and his body. Lord, may
[14:50] you go to him there in the hospital.
[14:52] You're you are a high priest that is
[14:54] touched by the feelings of our
[14:56] infirmities.
[14:58] Lord, you know what we go through. For
[15:00] you came to earth that you might go
[15:02] through what we go through. And Lord,
[15:04] you are touched by it and we commit it
[15:06] into your hands. And Father, as we turn
[15:09] to the word in a little bit, we just ask
[15:11] your blessing upon the word. Anoint our
[15:14] pastor. Aresh
[15:18] Lord. For we have heard enough through
[15:20] that gift that Lord ought to put us into
[15:22] rapturing cycles in our life.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; But Lord, once more, may you use the
[15:27] gift
[15:28] &gt;&gt; and may you touch our lives, taking us a
[15:30] little bit further, drawing us a little
[15:32] bit nearer to yourself. Bless brother
[15:34] Ryan as he leads us in worship and
[15:36] prepare as we prepare our hearts for the
[15:38] word this morning. And Lord, we are
[15:41] going to take up an offering. We want to
[15:43] commit it into your hands. We ask Lord
[15:46] that you'll receive it as we give it as
[15:49] a form of worship unto you Lord. We
[15:52] surrender it to you, asking you to bless
[15:54] it, increase it, use it for your glory.
[15:56] Lord, we commit all to you in the
[15:58] wonderful name of Jesus Christ we pray.
[16:01] Amen.
[16:03] [Music]
[16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. Maybe as
[16:10] they take up the offering, we could just
[16:11] sing the same God.
[16:14] [Music]
[16:18] And we'll start with the chorus.
[16:21] The same God
[16:24] who spoke to
[16:26] the woman at the well
[16:30] is the same God who wondered
[16:37] [Music]
[16:43] the raing red sea.
[16:47] He is the same God who's living in
[16:53] me. I look back on history. Oh, I look
[16:57] back on history. I see the mighty God
[17:02] unveil.
[17:05] Proving over and over that his word can
[17:10] never fail.
[17:12] But I can't keep on running on the last
[17:18] glory.
[17:21] He is the same God.
[17:24] [Music]
[17:29] Yes. The same God
[17:34] [Music]

[17:41] to raise to
[17:45] the same God.
[17:48] [Music]
[17:54] He is the same God
[17:57] to me.
[18:00] [Music]
[18:02] When the same God created all the
[18:07] heavens and all the earth
[18:10] came back
[18:12] Jesus and there was power in his word.
[18:18] Now in these last days I

[33:26] their hearts and all of us together that
[33:29] you'd speak to us through thy word. For
[33:32] thy word is truth.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; In the name of the word Jesus Christ, we
[33:39] ask. Amen.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:49] And Jesus said,
[33:53] "Our Father, which art in heaven,
[33:57] hallowed be thy name,
[34:00] thy kingdom come,
[34:02] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[34:05] heaven.
[34:07] Give us this day our daily bread.
[34:12] and forgive us our debts
[34:15] &gt;&gt; as we forgive our debtors.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; And lead us not into temptation, but
[34:20] deliver us from evil. For thine is the
[34:23] kingdom and the power and the glory
[34:26] forever.
[34:28] Amen.
[34:29] Dear heavenly father, we've read these
[34:32] glorious
[34:34] words, inspired words,
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, and how you taught us to
[34:39] pray. We're not here to pray with a
[34:41] multitude of words, but to ask you to be
[34:45] present with us
[34:47] &gt;&gt; and to circumcise as your prophet has
[34:50] said.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Lord, I dedicate myself to you as I
[34:54] stand before these people.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; And before all of those that may be
[34:58] streaming today, I pray that you will
[35:00] bless them. Come into the room where
[35:02] they are, oh God. There are those that
[35:05] are needy. those as we heard this
[35:07] morning our brother David Law is in
[35:09] hospital. I pray father that you'll come
[35:11] into that room and may a mighty presence
[35:14] of God surround him and permeate him
[35:18] &gt;&gt; and give him oh God your thoughts.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; I ask oh God you will give each one of
[35:23] us your thoughts today. May we be
[35:26] inspired by the Holy Spirit. For your
[35:28] Holy Spirit indeed is present with us.
[35:31] And Lord, I pray that you will reveal
[35:33] yourself in your word as we read it, as
[35:37] we look upon it, as we ponder it, as we
[35:40] meditate. All of this will be in vain
[35:42] unless you are here present to do it,
[35:45] Lord.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:52] I want to speak to you this morning on
[35:55] something I've been pondering for quite
[35:57] a long time.
[36:00] And uh
[36:02] the the subject is two worlds.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; We're in one here, physical one.
[36:13] And uh we have everything that you've
[36:16] experienced this last week
[36:18] and we'll continue to experience. But
[36:21] there's another world
[36:24] &gt;&gt; and I just wondered where that world is
[36:26] and and we will find from the messenger.
[36:30] So listen to closely now. The messenger
[36:33] God sent you
[36:36] &gt;&gt; stepped into another world.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Unannounced
[36:41] &gt;&gt; unpredicted. Yeah.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; And uh without any fanfare
[36:46] &gt;&gt; and began to tell people their names,
[36:50] &gt;&gt; where they lived. He knows your name.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; He knows where you live.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; He knows all about you.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; He knows all about me.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; And I felt it's my responsibility this
[37:05] morning to tell you about that world.
[37:08] And we will find and I believe if we
[37:10] look
[37:10] &gt;&gt; yes
[37:11] &gt;&gt; at the messenger God sent and allowed
[37:13] him access to that world ready immediate
[37:17] access back and forth and would tell us
[37:20] then we need to know uh for with full
[37:23] assurance
[37:24] &gt;&gt; that that world is just that close
[37:27] &gt;&gt; and the only thing that numbs us to it
[37:29] is this world
[37:31] &gt;&gt; and all of the things and so on. So we
[37:33] want to talk about that. I'll have you
[37:35] turn to uh the book of Acts,
[37:39] the first chapter,
[37:41] and we'll read the first seven verses.
[37:43] Then I'll
[37:45] let you have your seats,
[37:51] Acts 1.
[37:56] The former treatise have I made, O
[37:59] Theophilles, of all that Jesus began to
[38:02] do and teach until the day in which he
[38:05] was taken up after that he through the
[38:07] Holy Ghost had given commandments unto
[38:10] the apostles whom he whom he had chosen,
[38:15] to whom also he showed himself alive
[38:17] after his passion, by many infallible
[38:20] proofs, being seen of them 40 days, and
[38:23] speaking of the things pertaining to the
[38:25] kingdom of God and being assembled
[38:28] together with them, commanded them that
[38:30] they should not depart from Jerusalem,
[38:33] but wait for the promise of the Father,
[38:35] which says he, you have heard of me. For
[38:39] John truly baptized with water,
[38:42] but you shall be baptized with the Holy
[38:44] Ghost, not many days hence."
[38:48] When they therefore were come together,
[38:50] they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt
[38:54] thou at this time restore again the
[38:57] kingdom to Israel. And he said unto
[39:00] them, it is not for you to know the
[39:02] times or the seasons which the father
[39:06] hath put in his own power.
[39:11] God bless you. You may have your seats.
[39:20] You'll need to follow very very closely
[39:23] and if you have a pencil you might want
[39:25] to make a note here or there. If you
[39:28] have a question, I'd be happy to address
[39:31] it. Not in this service, but later. And
[39:33] if I don't get done this morning, I will
[39:35] just uh close the service and then uh
[39:38] because brother John Andy's will be
[39:40] speaking tonight, brother Tom will be
[39:42] speaking in in Renton.
[39:45] So I would like to say after this uh
[39:47] reading of scripture having just
[39:49] experienced the resurrection
[39:51] &gt;&gt; the disciples, the apostles and the
[39:53] followers of Christ and uh that event
[39:57] which seemed uh uh so in incredible
[40:03] they
[40:05] the thing that was on their mind was the
[40:07] restoration of Israel. Are you going to
[40:09] restore? Is this the time? This event is
[40:12] so incredible.
[40:14] uh a man has raised from the dead. Our
[40:17] Lord Jesus Christ has raised from the
[40:19] dead. Surely he's going to restore the
[40:21] kingdom. That was the focus of their
[40:22] minds.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; We all have a focus.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; And it's it's on the conclusion of our
[40:28] faith.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Where are we headed?
[40:30] &gt;&gt; And what we speak about of course which
[40:33] is which is only right is the rapture,
[40:36] the change of the body and the
[40:38] resurrection uh of those that are asleep
[40:40] in Christ. that is uh which is uh that
[40:44] is something that to miss that is
[40:46] unthinkable.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; And yet when I read some things that the
[40:50] prophet of God has spoken about it, it's
[40:52] it's almost frightening. So that very
[40:56] few
[40:57] &gt;&gt; very few
[40:58] &gt;&gt; will make the rapture.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; And so that's not to put any doubt in
[41:02] our minds or to cast any shadow, but it
[41:06] is to thrust you forward
[41:09] &gt;&gt; to say I cannot miss this. Amen.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; And if someone might just relax back and
[41:14] say, "Well, we're all predestinated.
[41:16] We're either in or we're out." Well,
[41:17] that shows for sure you're lacking
[41:19] something.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Uh we're not to lean back just on on
[41:23] predestination. Say, "Well, I'm
[41:26] predestinated. I'm going to make it."
[41:27] That's the wrong way to begin with. That
[41:30] isn't predestination.
[41:32] predestination will uh thrust a person
[41:35] forward and say you know I must I must
[41:38] attain this as the apostle Paul said
[41:43] and so the scripture also says and I
[41:45] have many scriptures and and quotes and
[41:47] so you'll just follow along closely
[41:49] please
[41:50] because I've been going over this for a
[41:52] number of weeks
[41:55] in Romans 8:23
[41:57] uh Paul is saying and not only they in
[42:00] fact as I want to read uh 22 as well.
[42:04] For we know that the whole creation
[42:07] groanth and travaleth in pain until now.
[42:12] And not only they, but ourselves also,
[42:16] which have the first fruits of the
[42:17] spirit, even we ourselves grown within
[42:22] ourselves, waiting for the adoption to
[42:25] wit the redemption of our body. There
[42:28] isn't anyone here but what has a
[42:31] groaning?
[42:34] &gt;&gt; This this world presents us with things
[42:38] that sets up a groaning within us.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; And we groan for two reasons. We groan
[42:44] because uh of of the thing we
[42:47] experience, the burdens that we
[42:49] experience.
[42:50] And we groan because that within us is
[42:53] declaring this should not be.
[42:57] Prophet said a tree, you know, a tree
[42:59] struggles because there's a place where
[43:02] a tree doesn't struggle.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Flowers and so on and so forth. And men
[43:07] in life and women as well, uh, in life,
[43:11] we experience things that we know
[43:13] there's something within us that's
[43:15] saying this isn't the way it's supposed
[43:17] to be.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; This isn't the way it's supposed to
[43:19] happen. And there's something and and
[43:22] there's a a groaning and a travail that
[43:25] comes within. So I want to I want you to
[43:28] remember that as we as we move forward
[43:30] in the in the message. Now Moses and
[43:34] this is what I was thinking about early
[43:36] early this morning. Moses he looked upon
[43:39] the burdens of his brethren. Brother
[43:41] Brandham said that uh Pharaoh looked
[43:44] through the same window,
[43:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[43:46] But Moses looked to upon his brethren
[43:51] and uh
[43:54] he he he saw his brethren in with
[43:57] burdens
[43:59] and he was so burdened
[44:02] until he slew a man.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Now I don't think anyone here has done
[44:06] that.
[44:08] I would say a person has to be really
[44:10] quite desperate
[44:12] at the injustice that you're looking
[44:14] upon.
[44:16] to be a God called prophet
[44:20] &gt;&gt; and to slay another man
[44:23] &gt;&gt; because of the injustice that he's
[44:25] seeing. You can't convince me
[44:28] &gt;&gt; that he wasn't terribly
[44:31] had some convictions. Uh even though he
[44:34] was in all the uh the beauty of and and
[44:38] educated in all the wisdom of Egypt and
[44:42] yet there's something that's not right.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; And there's something in him calling and
[44:48] saying that's not the way it's supposed
[44:49] to be. They're not supposed to be in
[44:51] slavery. They're not supposed to be in
[44:53] bondage. They're not supposed to be. And
[44:55] we have perhaps loved ones.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; We have perhaps immediate family or very
[45:01] close family and we we we are connected
[45:05] with them. And God has seen that we're
[45:06] connected one way or another. And so we
[45:09] are saying there's something within us
[45:10] that's saying this is not the way it's
[45:12] supposed to be.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you that world
[45:19] &gt;&gt; that is generating that within you is
[45:22] very present.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:24] is very near.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; So Moses looked upon them burdened. He
[45:29] was already groaning but he could not
[45:32] identify that groaning. And then
[45:34] sometime later, many years later, he
[45:37] faced a burning bush.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; And in that burning bush, a voice said,
[45:43] "I'm the God of Abraham."
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Well, he knew that was his forefathers.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. This is his
[45:51] forefathers. And now he hears a
[45:54] supernatural voice identifying himself
[45:57] as being the God of his forefathers. So
[46:00] that's connected to me.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Uh I can identify with that right away.
[46:06] Abraham is my forefather.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Isaac's my forefather. And this one that
[46:11] is supernaturally speaking to me I can
[46:13] identify with. And now and now he's
[46:16] saying and and goes right to his
[46:18] groaning. Come on.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; I've come down to deliver them.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; I want you to go.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; So the God
[46:29] of the deep, we sing the song, there's a
[46:32] deep, deep calling. The prophet spoke on
[46:35] deep callth to the deep at the sound of
[46:37] thy water spouts
[46:39] and at the noise of thy water spouts.
[46:42] There isn't anyone here. That's why you
[46:44] come to church. That's why you're
[46:47] sitting here
[46:48] &gt;&gt; because there's a a groaning for
[46:50] something
[46:51] &gt;&gt; you're reaching out and maybe you can't
[46:53] even uh maybe you can't define it.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Maybe you can't even say exactly what it
[46:59] is.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Uh I've had people in my office and some
[47:03] perhaps even sitting here and they've
[47:05] said uh I feel that I need the Holy
[47:07] Ghost.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; And I said, well uh what will you be
[47:12] like when you get the Holy Ghost?
[47:16] I don't know.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; I said, 'Well, if you don't know what
[47:19] you'll be like when you get the Holy
[47:20] Ghost, how do you know you haven't got
[47:22] the Holy Ghost?
[47:24] &gt;&gt; And what what caused the doubter the
[47:26] question about the Holy Ghost? Because I
[47:29] can't baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
[47:31] Repent and be baptized in the name of
[47:33] Jesus Christ and you shall receive the
[47:37] gift of the Holy Ghost.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; So, it's his that's his responsibility.
[47:45] But there's a deep call
[47:48] within us and I I want to deal with that
[47:50] this morning because ultimately the
[47:53] focus of that deep call is I I must
[47:59] attain
[48:00] &gt;&gt; the rapture.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; I I believe that God has sent
[48:06] &gt;&gt; this message
[48:07] &gt;&gt; as a call
[48:09] &gt;&gt; to that rapture. And uh there's been
[48:12] such an unveiling of this word.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; And I must I must attain that.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; And that's why I'm living. That's why
[48:19] I'm here. That's why I pray. That's why
[48:22] I read the scripture. That's why I read
[48:25] the message. That's why I believe what I
[48:26] believe
[48:27] &gt;&gt; is for that one single purpose that I
[48:30] will attain the rapture.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; That's our focus. So there's a deep
[48:34] call. And I want to say to you today and
[48:38] especially perhaps to the young people,
[48:42] this God that set up that groaning or
[48:46] set up that call, he's the God of that
[48:50] call.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; He's the God of that groaning.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; He's the God of that groaning.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; And he'll identify himself. Yes.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Then you'll know where it came from and
[49:05] you can identify with it.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; U
[49:12] things that are to be. Brother Brandham
[49:14] said, "This life holds all kinds of
[49:16] evils. So therefore, the life that is to
[49:20] come won't have it."
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; This one has lust and sickness, death,
[49:27] &gt;&gt; because it's not the house that he's
[49:29] gone to prepare.
[49:32] Do you have some of that?
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Do you have sickness or anything like
[49:36] that or death? He said, "This is a pest
[49:40] house." And uh he was asking people if
[49:42] they know what a pest house is because
[49:44] they don't use that term today, but they
[49:46] used to when when there was contagious
[49:48] diseases, they'd put a sign on the on
[49:51] the door. It was a pest house. That's a
[49:54] house. He said that's uh well, that's
[49:57] where we're living. A pest is where they
[49:59] put people all the diseased people.
[50:02] Well, that's just what sin has done to
[50:05] us.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Uh put us in an earthly pest house.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; This world is a pest house.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Do I hear amen?
[50:16] &gt;&gt; This house is full of sin, sir,
[50:19] &gt;&gt; injustice,
[50:21] &gt;&gt; crime,
[50:22] &gt;&gt; violence.
[50:24] I read the other day where uh since the
[50:27] United Nations the United Nations that
[50:30] are to bring peace and have peace cores
[50:33] and so on. We have brother Hughes
[50:34] message here who's given his life and
[50:37] spent many years as as a peace corps uh
[50:39] from the Canadian in the Canadian
[50:41] military and because they want to have a
[50:44] reputation as peace uh givers and
[50:48] protection protection of peace and these
[50:51] nations have done very very much of that
[50:54] uh uh of the of the peace. However,
[50:58] there will not be any peace without the
[51:01] prince of peace.
[51:03] I believe we know that.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; But the United Nations since they were
[51:07] set up, there has been 240
[51:11] wars.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; 240 wars and they set up. And they only
[51:17] mandated
[51:18] uh action on two. I think it was Vietnam
[51:22] and Korea.
[51:24] Only those two wars.
[51:27] Isn't that quite a record
[51:30] &gt;&gt; for the hundreds of billions of dollars
[51:32] that it cost to keep them going? And
[51:34] they got 200. They can't do anything
[51:36] with Syria. Can't seem to. They're just
[51:38] lame, limp, nothing there. Well,
[51:44] take it for what it's worth. That's not
[51:45] my record. That's what they've said.
[51:49] I'm not down on them, but I I certainly
[51:52] I'm not in support of that kind of a
[51:53] record.
[51:55] Well, I had 240 chances and I was
[51:58] successful on two of them and say hello
[52:00] and goodbye.
[52:04] There is a groaning.
[52:07] And now I'm going to I'm going to
[52:08] belabor this point for a moment because
[52:11] I know that it's very present. And you
[52:13] know, we come in and we hear services
[52:17] and we hear messages and we read the
[52:18] word and and we get a a sense and a
[52:21] feeling of, you know, I could conquer
[52:23] anything. And there's a feeling of
[52:25] rejoicing and ecstasy and there should
[52:27] be when we go out the doors and we you
[52:30] know come to reality of where we're at
[52:33] &gt;&gt; and what we struggle with and you know
[52:35] it seems that uh you know even here we
[52:37] get mentally prepared so that it doesn't
[52:39] exist out there but when we go out there
[52:41] we find it very real and there it is.
[52:44] And I want to deal with that. I want to
[52:47] make I want to make the the world of
[52:50] your groaning so real that that one will
[52:53] lose its its effect.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; So there's a groaning, there's a travail
[53:05] for another land, a world wherein dwells
[53:09] righteousness.
[53:10] Jesus said in John 16, "Now Jesus knew
[53:14] that they were desirous to ask him
[53:18] and if you you you that have been
[53:21] present during the last services that
[53:22] I've spoken from about Easter forward
[53:26] and uh it wouldn't wouldn't do you any
[53:29] harm to hear them again."
[53:32] &gt;&gt; And this happens to be on the way to
[53:34] Gethsemane. These words, I want you to
[53:37] put yourself there. You're on the way to
[53:39] Gethsemane.
[53:41] You don't really know what's happening.
[53:48] Things have changed in the message of
[53:50] that time.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Seriously changed. The miracles seem to
[53:55] be gone.
[53:57] The power seems to be gone.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; The one you have followed and given
[54:04] everything to
[54:05] &gt;&gt; is acting very very different. and
[54:08] speaking very different. And so Jesus
[54:11] knew that they were desirous to ask him.
[54:15] And he said unto them, "Do you inquire
[54:19] among yourselves?"
[54:22] Of that I said,
[54:24] "A little while and you shall see me. A
[54:28] little while and you shall not see me.
[54:30] And again, a little while and you shall
[54:32] see me."
[54:35] His next verse. Verily, verily, I say
[54:38] unto you that you shall weep and lament.
[54:43] Let's not shed a few tears. You will
[54:45] weep and lament,
[54:47] but the world shall rejoice,
[54:50] and you shall be sorrowful, but your
[54:53] sorrow shall be turned into joy. A woman
[54:56] when she's in travail
[54:59] &gt;&gt; hath sorrow because her hour is come.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; His hour had come. Their hour had come.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; And I want you to see something that's
[55:09] fairly I think fairly rich and deep.
[55:14] They were in the very midst of
[55:18] the blinding of their entire nation.
[55:21] Yes,
[55:22] &gt;&gt; they were coming into more light,
[55:25] &gt;&gt; more glorious light.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; They were experienced the greatest thing
[55:28] that ever happened.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; They didn't know it, but they were
[55:31] experiencing it.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; And the rapture is going to be something
[55:36] &gt;&gt; or is something that that the earth has
[55:39] not experienced.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; And if you're called by this message, if
[55:43] you have been called by this prophet
[55:44] voice to experience this, that in itself
[55:48] is unparalleled in the world.
[55:51] Very few are called.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Very few attain that. But if you've been
[55:56] called to attain that, we should be
[55:58] pressing uh towards the mark of the the
[56:01] prize of the high calling in Christ
[56:03] Jesus with everything that's within us.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; And he said, "A woman that's in travail
[56:12] has sorrow because her hour is come. But
[56:14] as soon as she is delivered of the
[56:16] child, she rememberth no more the
[56:19] anguish for joy that a man is born into
[56:24] the world. And Jesus who was the son of
[56:28] man
[56:29] and my mind went quickly back and I
[56:32] don't know if I can uh uh succeed in
[56:35] having you follow me but uh the first
[56:38] man of promise was was se was Abraham.
[56:42] first man of promise. And that would
[56:45] have gone nowhere if he hadn't had a
[56:47] Sarah who by faith had strength to
[56:50] conceive. And she went into labor pains
[56:52] and brought forth Isaac.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Isaac had Rebecca. She went into labor
[56:57] pains and brought forth. And the lineage
[57:00] continued on. And that lineage was
[57:03] building of the image of Jesus Christ.
[57:06] Amen.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; And then finally there was a young girl
[57:10] only she was virgin and she had been
[57:13] conceived of by the Holy Ghost.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; And she had a new creation,
[57:20] &gt;&gt; a seed within her, a new creation.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. With blood.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Blood that was worthy to buy your soul.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Blood that was worthy to deliver every
[57:31] man and woman.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; And she was carrying that. And the Bible
[57:36] says that they they went because all of
[57:39] the world should be taxed and she's
[57:41] great with child
[57:44] &gt;&gt; and she went into labor pains and
[57:47] brought forth a son.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; She had travail and brought forth a son.
[57:52] And the son was God in flesh.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; That would be God in flesh to the
[57:58] people. The word in flesh but it came
[58:01] through to travail. And now Jesus, the
[58:04] son of man in his uh earthly time and
[58:09] period, now he's coming to the end.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said,
[58:15] you have to really pinch your mind now.
[58:19] Jesus said in Hebrews through Paul
[58:22] saying, "Behold, I and the children
[58:26] thou has given me."
[58:29] Now the second Adam
[58:31] &gt;&gt; was bringing forth a family
[58:35] &gt;&gt; hadn't taken a bride yet.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; She has another part to play.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; In this time and she will play it.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; She will be pregnantated
[58:46] &gt;&gt; by the word. The word which is here. She
[58:49] will be pregnantated by that word
[58:52] revealed. When it's revealed again,
[58:54] she'll be pregnantated and will receive
[58:56] that and will be hated by the world
[58:59] because of it
[59:00] &gt;&gt; and damned by the world
[59:03] &gt;&gt; and every nasty thing said about the
[59:05] message because they've come to another
[59:08] birth time,
[59:10] [Music]
[59:12] &gt;&gt; another travail time.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; The hour has come.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it helps you to be able
[59:21] to place yourself in the scripture.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; And so understand now some of the words
[59:26] that I spoke earlier when the disciples
[59:28] wanted to free Christ, you will not go
[59:31] to death. He said these things must be.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; These things must be.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? These things must be.
[59:40] Say, I hear this. Hear that. These
[59:43] things must be. And you pay no attention
[59:45] to it whatsoever because the hour has
[59:48] come.
[59:49] This is the hour for these things
[59:52] because a manchild
[59:54] the son of David
[59:56] &gt;&gt; must come into existence
[59:58] &gt;&gt; and a sit upon the throne of David.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; And Ruth the gentile bride of Moabitis.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Are you with me young ladies?
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; With me folks? and Ruth, the gentile
[1:00:15] bride, taken by Boaz.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; You'll find it in the breach and
[1:00:21] redeemed, brought into a brought into
[1:00:23] the uh cycle of redemption. And she was
[1:00:27] caught in that. She had been married,
[1:00:29] but he couldn't he didn't have any seed
[1:00:31] to give her. He didn't have the seed of
[1:00:33] the kings in him.
[1:00:36] IMC didn't have it
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; and her husband Mahalan, I believe it
[1:00:40] was, didn't have the seat of the kings.
[1:00:43] But then after a a period of drought,
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; something within her must have been
[1:00:52] crying out and groaning, why was I born
[1:00:56] a Moabitete?
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Why wasn't I born into the house of
[1:00:59] Israel? But I will stay with Naomi. I
[1:01:03] will stay with what word we have. I will
[1:01:08] stay with it because that word held the
[1:01:11] promise.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And finally Boaz came on the
[1:01:15] scene. Who is this young maiden? This is
[1:01:17] Ruth the Moabitis. And from that time
[1:01:20] the messenger who introduced him passed
[1:01:23] off the scene and is no more remembered
[1:01:26] in the book. Not brought to uh not
[1:01:28] spoken of in the book again. And Boaz
[1:01:31] takes and redeems Ruth and Naomi and
[1:01:35] obtains Ruth and she receives his seed.
[1:01:39] And now the process, the cycle of the
[1:01:42] kings and produces Oed and he and has
[1:01:46] Jesse and Jesse has David. You see the
[1:01:49] eternal God, that world is eternal.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; He's not doing things in our timeline.
[1:01:55] He's not doing things in our schedule.
[1:01:58] [Music]
[1:02:00] You cannot put the timeless God into a
[1:02:03] box of time.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; This prophet, this prophet in our day,
[1:02:09] he was in the timeless realm in this
[1:02:12] realm. Speaking of the timeless realm,
[1:02:13] and men in their little minds think
[1:02:16] they're going to take this timeless God
[1:02:18] and fix it, say, "Well, it didn't happen
[1:02:20] that way. It wasn't on this day." God
[1:02:22] doesn't know anything about days.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You understand what I say?
[1:02:29] How do you understand God when God says
[1:02:32] uh and and gives it to a vindicated
[1:02:34] prophet, you shall not make any graven
[1:02:36] image
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; of any likeness of anything in heaven or
[1:02:40] on earth, you shall not make a graven
[1:02:42] image. And then gives them all the
[1:02:44] specifications for the temple of the
[1:02:46] tabernacle rather, and saying, I will
[1:02:49] dwell with the people. You make this
[1:02:51] tabernacle and in the most holy holy
[1:02:54] holy place you'll have an ark and over
[1:02:57] the ark you'll have a mercy seat and
[1:02:59] over the mercy seat you'll put two
[1:03:01] cherubams graven images of cherubams and
[1:03:04] you'll put it in the most holy place.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Reconcile that for me
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; or the Torah which is the only Bible
[1:03:16] they had. The only Bible they had said
[1:03:18] it's an abomination. absolutely
[1:03:20] blasphemy to eat human flesh or to drink
[1:03:23] blood or to have anything with blood in
[1:03:26] it. You must have it absolutely free.
[1:03:28] That's why we have the kosher kosher on
[1:03:31] all the packages in your department
[1:03:32] store if it's kosher. And they've got
[1:03:35] all kinds of things added to it. But my
[1:03:37] when when Rabbi Richmond was here, my
[1:03:40] wife had a we have a set of pots and
[1:03:42] pans and everything set aside and it
[1:03:44] doesn't touch anything else. It just
[1:03:45] cooks kosher food for the Orthodox
[1:03:49] people that we've had. Garrison Solomon,
[1:03:52] his wife, Rabbi Richmond each time. And
[1:03:55] we have those dishes and those things
[1:03:57] just set aside for that. And that's why
[1:03:59] they don't mind coming to our place.
[1:04:01] They love coming to our place because
[1:04:03] they know that we honor the the the
[1:04:06] kosher and buy the kosher things and so
[1:04:08] on so forth. But here the only Bible
[1:04:10] they have at the time of the scripture,
[1:04:12] the only Bible says absolute blasphemy.
[1:04:15] And you're going to believe in this. Man
[1:04:16] says, "Unless you eat my flesh and drink
[1:04:19] my blood, you have no life in you." And
[1:04:21] just left it and walked away.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Never went back and explained it. Never
[1:04:27] went back and said, "Well, I know it's
[1:04:28] hard to understand, but let me just give
[1:04:30] you a little bit more." He didn't do
[1:04:31] that. He said, "You either believe it or
[1:04:34] you don't believe him."
[1:04:35] [Applause]
[1:04:36] this man was vindicated by God. You
[1:04:39] believe it or you don't believe it.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; And if you go the direction I don't
[1:04:43] believe, then then that's the result you
[1:04:45] get.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; And I think this congregation need to be
[1:04:48] a congregation of believers.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; And we believe the word the timeless God
[1:04:54] cannot be put into a a box of time.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; You can't take immortality and bring it
[1:05:00] down into the mindset of humans.
[1:05:04] He doesn't fit.
[1:05:06] [Music]
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; And so now we begin, even if we even if
[1:05:15] we realize this morning, you know what?
[1:05:17] After this service, we walk out of here
[1:05:18] and say, you know what? I don't know
[1:05:20] anything.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; That's a plus.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; That's a plus. And then if God makes
[1:05:25] himself known, then you know something.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Say, well, you know what? I heard
[1:05:29] something and it really set me thinking
[1:05:31] this morning. That's a That's a double
[1:05:34] plus.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; So Jesus knew and he said a woman when
[1:05:40] she's in travail because
[1:05:44] and I've been saying to you now and I
[1:05:46] want to repeat it again so you get it.
[1:05:49] They didn't have Easter
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; when this was happening.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; They don't even know what that word
[1:05:55] means.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Easter.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Bunnies and eggs and stuff.
[1:06:03] has nothing to do with what was going
[1:06:05] on. This was a cruel
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; uh judgment
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; taking an innocent man
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; and bringing him to the most cruel of
[1:06:15] deaths.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; But this was the travail that the church
[1:06:19] entered into
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; with him because the son of man is trans
[1:06:26] being transformed. Shall I say the same
[1:06:29] God is coming into another office by way
[1:06:32] of a birth into the son of God
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; and will be in a in a whole period of
[1:06:38] the New Testament era as son of God.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Son of God. God is a spirit.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; So he wanted to reveal himself as a son
[1:06:47] of God.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; A son of a product of that spirit.
[1:06:51] That's why Mary was conceived of by the
[1:06:55] Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; She produced a son of God.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; But he initially revealed himself
[1:07:04] because he was born of a woman. He
[1:07:06] revealed himself as a son of man
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; and fulfilled the scripture.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:12] G.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; And then before he left, he said, "When
[1:07:16] you see the days again of Noah
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; and you see the days of Sodom,
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; then I then the in in such a time will
[1:07:24] the Son of Man be revealed again." In
[1:07:26] other words, there'll be another man
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; who the son of man, the son of man
[1:07:33] reveal re will reveal himself through a
[1:07:38] son of man
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; and say, "Well, I don't understand it."
[1:07:42] Well, believe it
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; because that's exactly what the
[1:07:46] scripture is speaking about.
[1:07:51] And Apostle Paul says this
[1:07:55] in first 1 Thessalonians 4:15. For this
[1:07:58] we say unto you by the word of the Lord,
[1:08:01] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:08:03] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:08:05] them which are asleep. For the Lord
[1:08:08] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:08:10] shout, with the voice of the archangel,
[1:08:12] and with the trump of God, and the dead
[1:08:15] in Christ shall rise first. And the
[1:08:17] people said,
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; We believe that.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:08:26] be caught up together with them in the
[1:08:28] clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And
[1:08:32] so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[1:08:35] Wherefore comfort
[1:08:37] one another with these words.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the first verse of the
[1:08:42] next chapter says, "But of the times and
[1:08:45] the seasons,
[1:08:47] brethren, ye have no need that I write
[1:08:50] unto you." And it goes on.
[1:08:53] So the subject I want to say, Apostle
[1:08:55] Paul now is setting forth that listen
[1:08:58] very very closely
[1:09:00] because this this has troubled scholars
[1:09:03] and you can read all kinds of it if you
[1:09:04] wanted to and I would suggest you don't
[1:09:06] bother yourself about it. But the Old
[1:09:10] Testament says very very little about
[1:09:12] the afterlife.
[1:09:15] In fact is the doctrine of the
[1:09:19] resurrection is not a doctrine in the of
[1:09:22] the Old Testament
[1:09:24] and I'm going to give you some
[1:09:26] statistics just now. It became a
[1:09:29] doctrine. So that which happened to
[1:09:32] Jesus Christ that was kind of strange to
[1:09:35] them.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:38] uh eternal life and I have this for you.
[1:09:43] Eternal life is used
[1:09:45] only in the New Testament. The term
[1:09:49] eternal life is only used in the New
[1:09:52] Testament 26 times.
[1:09:55] Life eternal is used only in the New
[1:09:59] Testament four times.
[1:10:02] So eternal life doesn't appear in the
[1:10:05] Old Testament. And life eternal doesn't
[1:10:07] appear in the Old Testament.
[1:10:10] Everlasting life is used once in the Old
[1:10:14] Testament and 10 times in the New
[1:10:17] Testament.
[1:10:19] Everlasting life, I believe it's used in
[1:10:21] Daniel once. And life everlasting is
[1:10:25] used only in the New Testament four
[1:10:28] times. So eternal life, life eternal,
[1:10:32] everlasting life and life everlasting is
[1:10:36] really not found in the Old Testament as
[1:10:39] a teaching. It's not found. In fact is
[1:10:42] some of the Jewish people go back and
[1:10:44] say it does not appear uh an afterlife
[1:10:47] does not appear in the Torah which is to
[1:10:51] them the five books of Moses. It's used
[1:10:53] elsewhere perhaps once. And Job said,
[1:10:57] you know, I know that my redeemer liveth
[1:10:59] and at the last day I'll stand upon the
[1:11:01] earth, etc. But it's not a doctrine by a
[1:11:05] messenger as Apostle Paul was. Now,
[1:11:07] Apostle Paul gives it very specific.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; There'll be a resurrection and the dead
[1:11:12] and those that are asleep will rise
[1:11:14] first. Then we which are alive and
[1:11:16] remain. There's no such a thing in the
[1:11:18] Old Testament. So, it was put yourself
[1:11:20] back, please, and understand it was
[1:11:22] very, very difficult. And and I don't
[1:11:25] want you to dwell on how difficult it
[1:11:27] was for the believers then. That's why
[1:11:29] there was such a bewilderment, you know,
[1:11:32] and and and the son of man will be
[1:11:33] killed and he'll be and he'll rise
[1:11:35] again. This isn't a doctrine.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; This isn't something they understood.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; And he'll rise again.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; So this is a complete bewilderment. But
[1:11:45] we are we are down here many many
[1:11:48] centuries later and have received the
[1:11:50] kind of message we have. There should be
[1:11:52] no mistake.
[1:11:55] There should be no error whatsoever in
[1:11:57] our mind that this is a teaching that
[1:11:59] God has established
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; and God has confirmed
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; from Jesus right on through. He's con
[1:12:07] confirmed this. So, we have to come to
[1:12:09] the conclusion there's a process of
[1:12:11] redemption
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; and this is what's been happening. And
[1:12:15] here we are at the at the at the end of
[1:12:17] redemption. Now, listen, I'm I'm moving
[1:12:19] quickly and I'm jumping ahead of myself
[1:12:21] and then I'm going to come back to it.
[1:12:23] But uh the prophet says clearly that the
[1:12:27] Jews have gone back to their homeland
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; for the day of atonement.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; We play a part in that
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; because the Gentiles and that we we
[1:12:38] enter in at the at the closing of this
[1:12:41] era. We enter in there's a a rising
[1:12:44] Jesus said plainly that the world will
[1:12:46] hate you. Yeah.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Not going to think you're the finest
[1:12:52] person
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; in the staff
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; or where you work.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; You're an oddball.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; You're an oddball.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Accept it, folks. You're an oddball.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; That's what it is.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; And not well thought of. And then from
[1:13:10] even those from within, and I've been
[1:13:13] with ministers and so on and and I'm not
[1:13:16] troubled. I'm not troubled a bit.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; These things must be.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; It's here in the scripture.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; It's a travail. Does it is it is it a
[1:13:26] burdensome thing? Well, yes, there's
[1:13:28] some burden with it, but it's a glorious
[1:13:30] thing because a woman when she's in
[1:13:32] travail and he must pass from son of God
[1:13:36] to son of David.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; And that is why the prophet would say,
[1:13:41] "You're pregnantated."
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; And you're sealed.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:46] The womb is sealed
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; because God has given you that seed.
[1:13:51] [Music]
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; And that seed can only produce what this
[1:13:55] word has written. This is God's seed.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; You've received this word.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Have you followed me thus far?
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:14:09] But the times and seasons, brethren, you
[1:14:11] have no need that I write unto you. And
[1:14:14] so now I've given you that the subject
[1:14:16] of the resurrection was not a
[1:14:18] wellestablished subject in the Old
[1:14:20] Testament and thus the disciples. But
[1:14:24] you know friends even though they
[1:14:26] couldn't understand it did that did that
[1:14:29] stop
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; did that stop the church b being born?
[1:14:34] Did that stop the power of the Holy
[1:14:36] Spirit? No. That doesn't stop anything
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; though we don't maybe understand every
[1:14:42] detail and you know as humans we like to
[1:14:45] understand I like to understand these
[1:14:47] things many times it's not given to us
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; to understand as Jesus said to the
[1:14:52] apostles and the disciples
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; so it's very important that we
[1:14:57] understand that the plan and purpose of
[1:14:59] God
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; in the unseen world
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; is being played out in this physical
[1:15:07] visible world.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; And this is where now where the rubber's
[1:15:13] going to hit the road.
[1:15:16] Jesus said, "If I've told you of earthly
[1:15:19] things and you believe not, how shall
[1:15:22] you believe if I tell you of heavenly
[1:15:23] things?
[1:15:25] And no man hath ascended
[1:15:28] up to heaven, but he that came down from
[1:15:31] heaven,
[1:15:33] even the Son of man which is in heaven.
[1:15:37] And he's standing there and those
[1:15:40] people, I want you to put yourself there
[1:15:44] around him.
[1:15:46] when he said that no man's ascended up
[1:15:48] to heaven
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; except he that came from heaven
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; even the son of man which is in heaven
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; and he's standing there and say
[1:15:58] that again
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; and you'd walk away from that and he
[1:16:04] wouldn't say it again or he wouldn't
[1:16:05] explain it
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; and you'd have to go out saying you know
[1:16:09] what I don't really know anything
[1:16:12] I can't figure that out
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; even the son of And I believe that he
[1:16:16] came from heaven. I believe he's the son
[1:16:18] of God. I believe he's the son of man.
[1:16:21] Whatever. And he says he came down from
[1:16:25] heaven. And the son of man that's in
[1:16:28] heaven.
[1:16:30] They say, "Well, I thought that this
[1:16:32] world was, you know, a world of trouble
[1:16:35] and famine and all of these things."
[1:16:38] But the unseen world is unfolding in the
[1:16:43] visible world.
[1:16:49] And in Mark he said this. And when the
[1:16:53] Sabbath day was come, he began to teach
[1:16:56] in the synagogue. And many hearing him
[1:16:58] were astonished and saying, From whence
[1:17:01] hath this man these things?
[1:17:05] That's the statement. From whence hath
[1:17:07] this man these things? So they could
[1:17:10] regard that he has these things. We're
[1:17:13] astonished at these things. But where
[1:17:15] did he get these things?
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; And I say to, you know, if there was
[1:17:19] nothing to the message, the world
[1:17:21] wouldn't pay any attention to it. They
[1:17:23] say a bunch of people just off the wall.
[1:17:25] No, they know. They're astonished with
[1:17:28] these things.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; They're amazed at these things, but they
[1:17:33] can't figure out where did this man get
[1:17:35] these things.
[1:17:38] We hear these tapes or we hear these
[1:17:40] things and and if you look at it with
[1:17:42] the mind of I'm going to see where it
[1:17:45] aired. Well, if you looked at it and to
[1:17:47] see where Jesus aired, you would find
[1:17:50] lots of places that he aired according
[1:17:52] to your understanding. But the problem
[1:17:55] is you've got an eternal God. You're
[1:17:57] trying to put him in a box. You're
[1:17:59] trying to put him an immortal. He
[1:18:01] doesn't know anything about yesterday or
[1:18:03] tomorrow or anything. Incidentally,
[1:18:07] while I was away, and I mentioned this
[1:18:08] to a couple of the ministers,
[1:18:11] uh, how many here have heard of Stephen
[1:18:13] Hawking?
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; A lot of you. Good. Stephen Hawking is
[1:18:19] the Einstein of yesterday
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; and he's so brilliant. The fact is he
[1:18:24] was here in Vancouver and I went down
[1:18:26] and heard him and he speeched by a
[1:18:30] computer voice touching buttons and
[1:18:33] answered questions on the universe and
[1:18:35] things. I mean, just incredible.
[1:18:38] And I thought that was so And there he's
[1:18:40] all twisted up with that uh Garrick's
[1:18:43] disease, Legareric's disease.
[1:18:46] And I thought it was so amazing. But he
[1:18:49] said
[1:18:50] he said a a a child once asked him, "Dr.
[1:18:56] Hawkins, why can't we remember the
[1:18:59] future as well as we remember the past?"
[1:19:04] And and Stephven Hawkings put that in
[1:19:07] his book. He said, "I thought that was a
[1:19:09] very intelligent question."
[1:19:13] And I can tell by the silence. You don't
[1:19:16] think it's quite that intelligent,
[1:19:18] but we're not in the realm that Stephen
[1:19:21] Hawking is. We're not thinking where he
[1:19:22] is. He's got the time warps and
[1:19:25] everything else. But the prophet got
[1:19:26] into that also. He touched it. And did
[1:19:28] you did you know students that brother
[1:19:31] Brandham used the time time space or
[1:19:33] space time and he puts those two
[1:19:36] together that is absolutely a scientific
[1:19:38] term
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; and then he talks about which also is
[1:19:45] this probably perhaps didn't come by
[1:19:47] some divine revelation but he said that
[1:19:49] you know they can travel and he said I
[1:19:52] think science says you can travel say
[1:19:54] for 300 years and when you would come
[1:19:56] back you're only 50 years older.
[1:19:59] even though you've been gone 300 years.
[1:20:02] Uh, can you figure that out? I can't
[1:20:05] figure that out. So, I'm here. I'm just
[1:20:08] saying, you know, I don't know anything.
[1:20:11] I really don't. So, I'm just saying it
[1:20:12] the way he said it. And Stephen Hawking
[1:20:16] said, you know, I thought that was very
[1:20:18] intelligent. Why can't we remember the
[1:20:20] future uh as well as we remember the
[1:20:23] past? And it meant a lot of sense to
[1:20:25] him. He thought that was a very
[1:20:27] intelligent question.
[1:20:29] So there it is.
[1:20:36] Now we're getting down to the meat of
[1:20:38] the subject. Jesus said
[1:20:42] Jesus rather the prophet said of Jesus
[1:20:45] Jesus lived in a world nobody knowed
[1:20:47] anything about.
[1:20:51] He said it is
[1:20:54] I'm in another world.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; I'm just taking phrases.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; I'm in another world and the two worlds
[1:21:04] that exist at the same time. Now we're
[1:21:06] talking about rapture.
[1:21:12] And he said, "A vision,"
[1:21:15] and this is at thy word in 1953,
[1:21:20] he said, "A vision causes you to be in
[1:21:23] two worlds at the same time."
[1:21:26] So a vision caused that. He said,
[1:21:29] "You're in this world here now, yet
[1:21:33] you're in another world." He was
[1:21:34] describing it.
[1:21:36] He said, "You're speaking over there
[1:21:39] knowing that your voice is heard back
[1:21:41] here speaking of himself. You know that
[1:21:44] you're you're over there and you're
[1:21:45] speaking and yet you and you know that
[1:21:48] the voice is being heard here, but
[1:21:51] you're over there.
[1:21:53] Then after a while, it gets to a place
[1:21:55] you can tell. You can't tell whether
[1:21:58] you're over here or over here."
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Now, is is that real? Well, here here's
[1:22:05] a man, you know,
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; here's a man that went to school.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Here's a man that's married. Here's a
[1:22:11] man that's a father.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; And yet he stands here in front of the
[1:22:15] people and goes to some place
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; while he's standing there.
[1:22:22] That place where there is no war.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; That place where there is no violence.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; That place that is a place of absolute
[1:22:31] knowledge and wisdom
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; and comes back here and then people sit
[1:22:36] here with little peanut brains and try
[1:22:40] to figure out what he said.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; How can you figure out what he said when
[1:22:45] you don't even know where he was?
[1:22:51] Hallelujah.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Am I making some headway?
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:22:57] He said, "I don't even know where I'm at
[1:22:59] half the time."
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; And then in another message, God's God
[1:23:06] commissioning Moses, he said, "You don't
[1:23:08] realize, friend, what a strain.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; You're living in two worlds at the same
[1:23:12] time. But the angel of the Lord that you
[1:23:14] see on this picture is here now.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; So being in that realm, he knows that
[1:23:19] that angel is here now.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; And every spirit, notice now what
[1:23:25] happens. He just steps into absolute
[1:23:27] authority. And every spirit here in the
[1:23:30] building is subject to me by Jesus
[1:23:33] Christ at this time.
[1:23:36] [Music]
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Where do you get that kind of
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; authority?
[1:23:44] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I
[1:23:46] take possession
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; of every spirit in this building.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; That's like taking ownership.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; And sir, as we would see Jesus, it's
[1:24:00] anointing and it makes me feel different
[1:24:02] from than what I really am and read your
[1:24:05] life cuz you're in a dual condition.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; You're in the two worlds at the same
[1:24:11] time. Amen.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; This world cannot be understood with the
[1:24:16] natural mind. I'm going into perfect
[1:24:18] faith now. The message perfect faith.
[1:24:20] But Jesus lived in a world that no one
[1:24:22] knowed about.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; He was an odd person.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; He lived in a world of perfect faith
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; in the in the perfect God in which he
[1:24:30] was.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; If we lived in a perfect faith of a
[1:24:34] Christian to what we are, we'd be a
[1:24:37] mystic to the world.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; The people wouldn't understand you.
[1:24:41] Now you're coming to He's inferring
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; please your full attention.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; He's inferring that this is for you.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; He's inferring there's a realm of the
[1:24:55] God of this message
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; that wants you to participate.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. and to become into such a realm
[1:25:03] that God can uh speak to you and show
[1:25:07] you things that cause you to be I don't
[1:25:09] want anybody to get any wild ideas this
[1:25:12] off-the-wall stuff. Brother Brandham
[1:25:14] lived a very very natural life.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; He said you'd be a mystic to the world
[1:25:23] and the people wouldn't understand you.
[1:25:25] Well, they don't understand you now, do
[1:25:27] they?
[1:25:29] So, is that a result of this world
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; or a result of the college you went to
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; or a result of the high school you
[1:25:36] graduated from?
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Or is that a result of where you work?
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Or is that a result of what you've heard
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; through this word
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; that has made you so the world doesn't
[1:25:49] understand you.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; You'd walk in the spirit and what the
[1:25:55] spirit said you would do. what it forbid
[1:25:58] you to you would not do. Then the people
[1:26:01] begin to say and you'd be a mystic
[1:26:03] person to them.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; He said that's the way it is to all
[1:26:07] believers. They're a mystic. The people
[1:26:10] don't understand because they live in a
[1:26:12] world to themselves.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus lived in a world that nobody else
[1:26:17] could touch. The disciples couldn't
[1:26:19] understand him when he spoke to them.
[1:26:22] Then they then uh they say this and then
[1:26:25] they said why you walk why are you
[1:26:29] talking riddles we don't understand this
[1:26:32] how can this be see they wasn't in the
[1:26:35] world that he lived in that's the
[1:26:37] problem when it sounds like a riddle
[1:26:39] then you say I'm not in the world that
[1:26:42] that speaker is in I'm not in the world
[1:26:44] where that statement originated
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; God take me into that realm
[1:26:52] Give me an understanding.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; I say, "Oh God," I'm not just preaching.
[1:26:59] I'm saying, "Oh God, grant that to this
[1:27:02] people." That's what this church stands
[1:27:04] for. That's what this church exists for.
[1:27:07] That's what this church was established
[1:27:09] on. Oh God, give us a mind that
[1:27:13] understands what seems like a riddle to
[1:27:15] the world.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; You'll never learn it in the
[1:27:19] encyclopedia. You'll never learn it in
[1:27:21] the college or your school. You'll never
[1:27:24] learn it. That That's why I thank God
[1:27:26] for the school that we have. So that the
[1:27:28] atmosphere is there. It's conducive to
[1:27:31] supernatural things. And you young men
[1:27:34] and young ladies, you thank God. Oh God,
[1:27:38] you provided people. You provided
[1:27:40] teachers. You provided ministry. You
[1:27:42] provided us with a burden in a vision.
[1:27:45] And it's my it's my grand privilege to
[1:27:48] carry this on. Amen.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; So it's another world. And the reason
[1:27:59] why I'm I know I've I know you may say
[1:28:02] in your mind, well, why do you say it,
[1:28:05] you know, more times when two or three
[1:28:07] times? Because there's different things,
[1:28:10] different aspects that are said.
[1:28:14] And while I'm while I'm speaking, I want
[1:28:17] you to know that world is right here.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; That world is very present.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; That world is more real than the one
[1:28:29] you're in.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Sitting in a physical state
[1:28:34] in a physical body.
[1:28:36] You say, "Well, that seems to get off
[1:28:38] into almost like a mystic realm." It is.
[1:28:44] It is
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; it's a realm that God, your brain needs
[1:28:50] the Holy Spirit
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; to come down and illuminate you with
[1:28:54] divine light.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; And there's another reason why I want
[1:29:01] to, and I'll I'll bring this out. You're
[1:29:03] living in two worlds. When he says
[1:29:04] you're, he's speaking of himself most of
[1:29:06] the time. You're living in two worlds at
[1:29:08] the same time. You're in a dimension
[1:29:11] that the world knows nothing about. The
[1:29:13] world knows nothing about this
[1:29:16] dimension.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that?
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; And there's no way to explain it. Do you
[1:29:24] agree with that?
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; There's no way to explain it.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; It's another world. And that's why I
[1:29:33] wouldn't even venture to explain it.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; It's to be believed. Amen.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; And did you know uh do you now believe
[1:29:42] in Owens ownsboro, Kentucky, he said
[1:29:45] it's another world like two worlds. You
[1:29:48] break over into this world and this
[1:29:50] world and you stay you stay in it too
[1:29:53] long you hardly know just now. He said
[1:29:56] when leaving the platform when it comes
[1:29:58] on I feel like oh I was up in the
[1:30:01] heavens but when it's off of me I feel
[1:30:03] good but in between those times. So
[1:30:07] there is an in between those times.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; It seems like you're just stepping off
[1:30:13] the world.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; No need in me trying to explain it. You
[1:30:19] can't explain God.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; You've got to believe God.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; You can't explain God. I've stood behind
[1:30:26] this pulpit and I've tried to imitate
[1:30:32] Brother Brandham's movements and that is
[1:30:34] for this very purpose right here.
[1:30:36] I've heard these things. I've known
[1:30:38] these things. But in my testimony that I
[1:30:40] just gave down in Louisiana,
[1:30:43] and if you want to go back and see the
[1:30:47] go back and see the uh deep call to the
[1:30:51] deep and brother Benham, he has a prayer
[1:30:55] line up and there's a lady there and
[1:30:56] ministers are behind him. And then he he
[1:30:59] gets talking to the congregation. and he
[1:31:01] kind of gets inspired and he said if the
[1:31:03] God if people wouldn't believe me you
[1:31:05] know like if I were God sends his gifts
[1:31:08] and God sends his ministers and God
[1:31:10] sends this and he's talking like that
[1:31:11] and then then he turns around like this
[1:31:15] and
[1:31:17] he kind of shakes his head. That's the
[1:31:20] problem. He doesn't know what world he's
[1:31:22] in.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; And he sees this woman and he says, "It
[1:31:28] is, is this a patient?" That's exactly
[1:31:31] where he is.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; He's not sure. It's just in between.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; And then when you get up into that
[1:31:38] heavenly realm, as it were, and you're
[1:31:41] taking command of the every spirit's
[1:31:44] under my command right now. The angel of
[1:31:46] the Lord is here. I take possession of
[1:31:48] every spirit in this building. When did
[1:31:50] you ever hear a man say that? And then
[1:31:52] coming with that divine wisdom and
[1:31:55] telling people their names or whatever
[1:31:57] more. Then step down and you have to go
[1:32:00] home.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Dear I I I would you take out the
[1:32:04] garbage.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Then you're back in the real world.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; What's the garbage mean? What? What's I
[1:32:15] got to go to the store and get some
[1:32:16] groceries. What's that mean?
[1:32:18] I've just been a place there's no such a
[1:32:20] thing as
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; shopping,
[1:32:23] no such a thing as a need.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; I just come from that divine presence.
[1:32:29] And now you're hearing this one.
[1:32:30] Unclean,
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; worthless,
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; sick,
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; people afflicted, people possessed,
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; walking down the street undressed,
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; insanity.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; You never see such a thing like that.
[1:32:45] And people all taken up and Yeah. about
[1:32:48] this and that and about the other thing
[1:32:50] and all burdened about this and all the
[1:32:52] other things and it's is this the world.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; There's a place friends where this world
[1:32:58] doesn't matter very much.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; I hope it means something to you.
[1:33:16] He says, "Visions make me weak." You're
[1:33:19] living in two worlds. Now, we're not
[1:33:21] just talking about a prophet and what he
[1:33:23] experienced.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; I want you to go behind the scenes. God
[1:33:27] has sent this for you to hear,
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; for you to visualize and see. for you to
[1:33:35] determine why he did that for you, for
[1:33:38] this congregation, for this ministry,
[1:33:40] for these brothers that are behind me.
[1:33:42] Why did God do this? Why should we be
[1:33:45] hearing that?
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Because you need it.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; For where you're going, this has been
[1:33:53] sent to help you to get there.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; He says you're in two worlds. You're
[1:34:02] here and then you're in another world.
[1:34:05] You can't help that. Just like you
[1:34:07] dreamed a dream. How many dreamed a
[1:34:09] dream last night?
[1:34:12] Don't be ashamed. Put up your hand if
[1:34:13] you dreamed a dream. Look at all these
[1:34:15] dreams. My goodness.
[1:34:18] Did it mean anything?
[1:34:21] Why? Why didn't you stop it and say,
[1:34:23] "I'm not going to have that."
[1:34:26] He can't stop it like you can't stop it.
[1:34:30] You just dream a dream
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; and somebody doesn't dream. Why didn't
[1:34:34] you dream if you didn't dream? Shame on
[1:34:36] you. You should have dreamed something.
[1:34:39] You can't dream. He said he said some
[1:34:42] people subconscious and the conscious
[1:34:44] too far apart. And then those that
[1:34:46] dream, they're he said they come close
[1:34:48] together and that's where you dream. He
[1:34:49] said and the prophet they come right
[1:34:51] together. The conscious and the
[1:34:53] unconscious the consciousness come right
[1:34:55] together and he doesn't have to dream.
[1:34:57] He doesn't go into sleep to dream his
[1:35:00] dream.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; And he's not seeing a picture like you.
[1:35:03] And when you dream, you saw a picture
[1:35:04] and you saw all the colors and you saw
[1:35:06] everything. I had a dream the other
[1:35:08] night and it must have taken hours.
[1:35:12] But science tells me it just went
[1:35:14] through my mind. And how could my mind
[1:35:16] grasp all of that? I mean, so many
[1:35:18] details. It takes 15 minutes maybe to
[1:35:20] tell my wife the whole dream. And they
[1:35:23] say I had it in a quarter of a second, a
[1:35:25] split second. I I didn't know my mind
[1:35:27] was capable of that
[1:35:29] all that information in such a short
[1:35:31] time. Now
[1:35:34] now you'll understand I understand from
[1:35:36] brother Brandham's family that sometime
[1:35:40] when you go into uh
[1:35:43] go into interviews and has people lined
[1:35:45] up for interviews, he had the answer for
[1:35:47] all of them
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; before they came. Amen.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Or in a prayer line,
[1:35:54] why wouldn't he know this one
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; if he's going to tell a dream? Well, you
[1:35:58] know, I was traveling to a certain place
[1:35:59] and the person comes up there and says,
[1:36:01] "Well, you came from a certain place.
[1:36:03] You came over here and your car was a
[1:36:05] color green and you have a letter in
[1:36:07] your pocket and and and you know, and
[1:36:09] this is why you're here." Then the next
[1:36:11] one and the next one.
[1:36:17] He says, "Well, you're living in two
[1:36:19] worlds. This is a redemption by power."
[1:36:22] And you're in a world here and you're in
[1:36:24] a world there.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; You're with somebody else maybe 50 years
[1:36:28] ago.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; He's in another world
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; and he's with this person 50 years ago.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll tell you what. I I told some
[1:36:40] of these things I haven't told my
[1:36:41] testimony very much. And uh Joanne said,
[1:36:45] "Dad, you haven't even told us some of
[1:36:48] those things." Brother Brandham told me
[1:36:51] about the blind man in Bombay, India,
[1:36:53] Mumbai now. And he was in India and this
[1:36:57] blind man, he was a sun worshipper and
[1:37:00] he burned his eyes out
[1:37:03] and they're just, you know, couldn't see
[1:37:05] anything. And brother Brandham went into
[1:37:08] a vision and saw him. Now, this will
[1:37:11] help you. Saw him
[1:37:15] uh doing something.
[1:37:18] So, he saw that he had he could tell by
[1:37:21] what he was doing. Now, Brother Bram's
[1:37:22] in the future. The man's not even there
[1:37:24] yet.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; I'll spin your head out.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; He's not even there yet.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; And he he he looks at the man in the
[1:37:35] vision. In the vision. Because he's
[1:37:37] there.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; He's in a future state. Why can't I
[1:37:40] remember the future as well as I
[1:37:41] remember the past? He did.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; And he told me, he says, I saw I looked
[1:37:50] at his sideburns
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; and I could see some white hairs in it.
[1:37:57] And he says, and then
[1:38:00] he said, I, you know, had to come in
[1:38:02] between and look at him now. He said,
[1:38:04] look at his sideburns. And they were all
[1:38:06] black. He said, "So I knew he was going
[1:38:09] to have his vision,
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; but he didn't have it yet." He says,
[1:38:12] "Then I had to exercise my faith that he
[1:38:15] would receive it right now."
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; And I guess I was in the church where
[1:38:20] that happened
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; in India
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; with the with the host pastor's grandson
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; and stood behind the table. They haven't
[1:38:30] even moved the table that brother
[1:38:31] Brandham preached behind.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; So it's real.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:36] And the man got his sight. And then they
[1:38:38] said, he said that the police and the
[1:38:40] deacons or whoever had to try to protect
[1:38:43] him, they wanted to tear his pants and
[1:38:45] have a piece of his cloth from his suit
[1:38:47] or whatever more because they're very
[1:38:49] given over to holy man, etc. They
[1:38:52] recognized right away that this was
[1:38:54] unearly. So he looked,
[1:38:57] didn't he?
[1:39:00] So, you know, you know now why I was
[1:39:02] saying when you walk out,
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; you might well say, "I don't know
[1:39:06] anything."
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; And we certainly have no right to
[1:39:11] question this kind of ministry.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Said to somebody else maybe 50 years ago
[1:39:23] and you may be with somebody years from
[1:39:25] today.
[1:39:28] You may be with them 50 years ago and
[1:39:30] you may be with somebody years from
[1:39:32] today to come and yet you realize you're
[1:39:35] standing on the platform here and you're
[1:39:38] speaking something that that happened
[1:39:40] many many years ago, maybe weeks ago,
[1:39:43] months ago, another nation, another
[1:39:46] place or something.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; And you're standing there in a
[1:39:49] completely different environment.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; That world friends was this messenger
[1:39:55] had access. God gave him access so that
[1:39:59] we could have some understanding of
[1:40:01] where we're going.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; He didn't do this to tickle the ears.
[1:40:06] Didn't do this to, you know, surprise or
[1:40:08] shock the people. God didn't do this so
[1:40:10] that he would be glorified. That that
[1:40:12] the man would be glorified. God did this
[1:40:15] that he would be glorified that a people
[1:40:17] would rise up. And when this kind of
[1:40:19] ministry come and said, "Come out of
[1:40:21] her, my people. be separate, say the
[1:40:24] Lord. You would quiver and say, I will
[1:40:27] do that.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; I'm being called by another voice.
[1:40:32] [Applause]
[1:40:32] [Music]
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Contending for the faith, if you haven't
[1:40:40] heard that, the old tape that we have of
[1:40:44] contending for the faith has a when it
[1:40:47] comes to the end of the message, there's
[1:40:49] a small blank there. It's not on the
[1:40:52] current ones. It's not on the current
[1:40:54] tapes, but we have an old one we've
[1:40:56] preserved. My wife first heard this and
[1:40:59] I played it on the radio broadcast, but
[1:41:02] it is by brother Kelly was healed. He
[1:41:06] was in a terrible, terrible condition.
[1:41:08] And brother Brandham called him out and
[1:41:10] you can hear his voice and he's saying
[1:41:14] he's saying, "You've had a third of your
[1:41:16] stomach removed." Yes, I've had a third
[1:41:18] of my stomach removed. You're going to
[1:41:19] hear all of that on that tape. And he
[1:41:21] gives us testimony. So it does in
[1:41:23] contending for the faith kind of. You're
[1:41:26] working in two worlds. You're here and
[1:41:29] you're in another world. And when that
[1:41:31] goes out, then you go in and you see
[1:41:34] what you're uh what's standing near at
[1:41:36] the platform here. Listen to this.
[1:41:39] Angels of God and everything. uh and and
[1:41:43] you see hideous things that take place
[1:41:46] even from there because there there's
[1:41:48] nothing hidden
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; and you see hideous things take place
[1:41:51] then you're wondering sometimes and
[1:41:54] that's the reason I said when God calls
[1:41:56] you and maybe you a minister God called
[1:41:59] me and made me a seer
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; as he promised in the Bible
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; and the people who believe the Bible say
[1:42:06] amen
[1:42:07] [Applause]
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; in this world
[1:42:11] In this world, we may be total
[1:42:13] strangers, but in another world, we're
[1:42:15] all completely known. He says, "I'm not
[1:42:17] beside myself."
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; But this is a dimension. Two worlds.
[1:42:23] See, in our presence, we're standing
[1:42:25] here looking at one another. He's with a
[1:42:28] person standing here looking at one
[1:42:30] another as men. I don't know you. I've
[1:42:32] never seen you. You're a total stranger
[1:42:35] to me. I don't know you. Now, he's
[1:42:37] talking in the present.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; I don't know you. never seen you, but
[1:42:41] we're now standing here looking at one
[1:42:44] another.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; So, by your features and your face, I
[1:42:50] never seen you.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; And we're strange to one another. But
[1:42:55] there's another world.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Just out here
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; where the supernatural is
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; and that's where God lives.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; You're here as message believers. And
[1:43:08] that world is right here. And that's
[1:43:10] where God is.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; And you had a you had a physical prophet
[1:43:16] messenger who God gave access who
[1:43:19] stepped into that over a period of years
[1:43:22] and years and years.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; And that's where the Holy Spirit is.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; And he knows me
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; and he knows you.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he knows me and he knows
[1:43:36] you. Amen.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is speaking to one
[1:43:40] person as it happened to be a woman and
[1:43:42] he's talking to her and he's saying now
[1:43:47] you you were in another you were prayed
[1:43:49] for before.
[1:43:51] You were in an evangelistic meeting and
[1:43:54] you were prayed for before. You were
[1:43:56] prayed for by another man. And he begins
[1:43:59] to he said he's a a slim man kind of a
[1:44:02] slight man and his hair is and he
[1:44:04] started to say his hair is thinning. He
[1:44:07] said, "It's me."
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; He's in another place, in another city,
[1:44:13] in another time, in another time zone.
[1:44:17] And he's describing the person praying
[1:44:19] for her in the past. And he says, "It's
[1:44:22] me."
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "You, I prayed for you before."
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends,
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to leave this
[1:44:30] meeting today saying, "I follow a
[1:44:32] wonderful message.
[1:44:34] has been a wonderful revealing of Jesus
[1:44:37] Christ.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; This is what Jesus did.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; This is where Jesus was.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; And and he sent it again
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; to let me know of the place he went to
[1:44:52] prepare for us
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; and for me.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:57] G
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; immediately you know you're not in the
[1:45:04] presence of your brother.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; You're not in the presence of your
[1:45:10] brother.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; You're in the presence of God.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; So you started feeling something
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; and the man or the woman doesn't know
[1:45:18] what they're feeling. He said and he
[1:45:21] tells a woman on deep call to the deep.
[1:45:24] He said, she reaches out. Now, it means
[1:45:27] something more to you now. You've heard
[1:45:29] me say it before. Touches the pulpit. He
[1:45:32] said, "Now, that's all right. That won't
[1:45:34] hurt you.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; That's him, not me."
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; That's why he's saying it. He's in
[1:45:41] another world.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; And so,
[1:45:46] are you still with me? Am I all right
[1:45:48] for a little time yet? Just about 10
[1:45:50] minutes. I'm going to close. I'll just
[1:45:52] close.
[1:45:55] And he says immediately, "No, you're not
[1:45:57] in the presence of your brother. You're
[1:45:58] in the presence of God. You're aware of
[1:46:01] that."
[1:46:02] And I have said, "Never in the history
[1:46:04] of mankind did God give such public and
[1:46:08] open access
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; to the eternal realm."
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; You cannot find never in the history of
[1:46:17] human mankind
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; that God gave such immediate access.
[1:46:22] Amen.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; To the eternal realm. Why did he do
[1:46:25] that?
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Hello folks. Why did he do that?
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Why did he do that?
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; So these people of this generation would
[1:46:39] be without excuse. Amen.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; And if I go to prepare a place for you,
[1:46:48] Jesus said, I will come again and
[1:46:51] receive you unto myself
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; that where I am,
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; there you might be also.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; I hope you're getting this.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; He He made this display. He made this
[1:47:07] show
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; not only to let you know there was
[1:47:11] another place, but to let you know this
[1:47:14] message has come to call you to that
[1:47:16] place and lead you to that place. And if
[1:47:20] you follow it, you'll end up in that
[1:47:22] place where Jesus said, I go to prepare
[1:47:24] a place. This is the place.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; There is no other place. This is the
[1:47:32] eternal realms. This is where God lives.
[1:47:34] This is where the Holy Spirit is.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to go.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; I want to go to heaven, don't you?
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; There's something within a believer
[1:47:49] that's calling and desiring
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; to know the times and the seasons.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; When will this be? We must be close. I
[1:47:58] get people writing me. They said, "Well,
[1:48:00] it it'll either be this year or next
[1:48:02] year." I don't know but I want to be
[1:48:04] there. I hope it's tomorrow or today.
[1:48:08] God cannot be explained in the timeline.
[1:48:11] And brother Ben Brandham in the future
[1:48:12] home he speaks of three stages of the
[1:48:15] world. And uh out of Peter out of second
[1:48:19] Peter third chapter speaks of whereby
[1:48:22] the world that then was. And then in the
[1:48:25] verse seven he said but the heavens and
[1:48:27] the earth which are now.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; And then later on but we look for new
[1:48:32] heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth
[1:48:35] righteousness. And then he goes on to
[1:48:37] say in the 11th verse seeing then that
[1:48:40] all these things shall be dissolved.
[1:48:43] What manner of persons ought we to be
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; all these things. What's part what's
[1:48:48] troubling you right now? What are you
[1:48:50] groaning over? I know the greatest
[1:48:53] groaning is set up by the Holy Spirit,
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; the prize of the rapture.
[1:49:02] That's my greatest groaning.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Almost everyone here, I would say
[1:49:08] everyone here, you have something within
[1:49:11] you, a deep that's calling to the deep
[1:49:14] and it's a travail.
[1:49:16] That travailing is going on to birth you
[1:49:19] into that place. Amen.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Now, we have some earthly things
[1:49:23] happening, and I I have to get with it.
[1:49:25] I'm I'm going to have to cut some things
[1:49:27] out, but I want to get to this, please.
[1:49:30] Under each prophet, he said there's been
[1:49:33] birth pains.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; So, I'm into this travail. Now,
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; this world, now I want I want to blend
[1:49:43] the two together for a moment so you
[1:49:44] have more to think about.
[1:49:47] this unseen world and the things that
[1:49:50] are happening in the unseen are
[1:49:51] unfolding. Shall I say this? In the
[1:49:54] midst of the things that are taking
[1:49:57] place, the events of the world in the in
[1:50:00] the midst of it, God is unfolding the
[1:50:03] fulfillment of his scripture.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; The two worlds are actually uh going
[1:50:08] along
[1:50:33] And in the midst
[1:50:37] of birth,
[1:50:55] Holocaust
[1:51:00] the after the second war or during the
[1:51:02] second world war during that birth pain
[1:51:07] Israel is having an incredible birth
[1:51:09] pain
[1:51:11] because it is that birth pain that
[1:51:14] actually gives birth to a nation
[1:51:18] and they end up in a flea from Poland
[1:51:21] and from Germany and from Russia and
[1:51:24] from all over Europe. They flee to go to
[1:51:26] their homeland, fulfilling the
[1:51:28] scripture,
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Who's sending them back? God is sending
[1:51:32] them back. He said, "I will gather you.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; I scattered you. Now I will gather you."
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; And he creates all kinds of conditions,
[1:51:41] war and economic things and all kinds of
[1:51:44] things happen. And there is a a rabbi
[1:51:49] and this rabbi's name
[1:51:52] is Shapiro.
[1:51:54] Colonimus Calaman Shapiro.
[1:51:59] He was considered a grand rabbi. Not
[1:52:03] grand in the sense of a nice grand
[1:52:05] rabbi, but a grand of certain status
[1:52:08] rabbi
[1:52:10] in Poland.
[1:52:13] He was murdered at 54 years old by the
[1:52:16] Nazis during the Holocaust.
[1:52:20] Uh but he survived quite a lot of it by
[1:52:24] working in a shoe factory.
[1:52:28] And he says this the pains
[1:52:32] he was received as a as a very notable
[1:52:35] rabbi by many and is also by the more
[1:52:38] modern rabbis. is not really that well
[1:52:42] thought of.
[1:52:44] But he said the pains leading to the
[1:52:46] revelation of Messiah
[1:52:49] are similar to labor pains, suffering
[1:52:53] and suffering that leads to birth.
[1:52:56] In a similar vein, when a seed is
[1:52:59] planted, it must first rot in the
[1:53:02] ground. Only after the seed ceases to
[1:53:06] exist will a wonderful plant sprout from
[1:53:08] it. This plant will have leaves and
[1:53:11] branches and bear fruit, many times the
[1:53:14] size of the original seed. All this was
[1:53:17] hidden potential within a tiny seed
[1:53:20] which first had to die.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Does this sound familiar?
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Redemption is divine.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; The agents, in other words, the agents
[1:53:34] of redemption must be diminished.
[1:53:38] These are the pains of Messiah.
[1:53:41] Isaiah 66:9 says, "Shall I induce birth
[1:53:45] and not give birth?" Then says God
[1:53:51] uh
[1:53:52] in labor pain in labor and then he helps
[1:53:55] us to give birth. Of course, he's
[1:53:58] feeling of the the position of the
[1:54:00] Jewish nation which he needs to. He says
[1:54:03] the greater the labor pains,
[1:54:05] the greater
[1:54:07] uh the greater the divine light, I
[1:54:09] believe is what it says uh that they
[1:54:12] lead up to. These are the pains of
[1:54:14] disillusion
[1:54:16] dissolusion
[1:54:18] of the state of for the state of
[1:54:21] regeneration
[1:54:23] and pain for the sake and not pain for
[1:54:26] the sake of pain.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Now, we're not just suffering because
[1:54:30] we're suffering. We're not caught in
[1:54:33] this thing by accident.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; This is in God's plan. And in the plan,
[1:54:38] we are suffering this enormous pain
[1:54:42] and travail
[1:54:46] on behalf of Messiah
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; in the plan of Messiah.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; And then he went on to say, a seed must
[1:54:56] a seed must rot before the tea tree can
[1:54:59] grow. And as a woman must labor before
[1:55:02] she can give birth, so must we undergo
[1:55:05] the pains of Messiah before redemption
[1:55:08] comes. The master of the world brings
[1:55:11] salvation through suffering. I'm not
[1:55:13] speaking this. I'm simply quoting what
[1:55:16] he said. He doesn't have the message of
[1:55:19] course, but he is uh very very and
[1:55:22] brother Brandham says in the rapture now
[1:55:24] the rapture the rapture message.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; The fourth last service
[1:55:35] that corn of wheat fell in the ground
[1:55:38] and died under the dark age persecution.
[1:55:41] It went into the ground. It had to die.
[1:55:45] Any man spiritual can see that unless
[1:55:49] that seed dies and rot,
[1:55:52] it abides alone.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; And it had to go into the ground under
[1:55:56] the dark age. It laid there rotted and
[1:55:59] come forth in two blades of the Lutheran
[1:56:02] church. And he goes on, he said, "Have
[1:56:05] you noticed this last days? How it's
[1:56:07] begin to pull away?" Now,
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; now notice what the prophet is speaking
[1:56:12] of in these last days. It has be to pull
[1:56:15] away now.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; It's be to pull away now. And when that
[1:56:21] and when that wheat begins to grow, then
[1:56:23] the shock begins to get away from it.
[1:56:26] Yes.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; He wasn't
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; He wasn't sad. He wasn't trying to bring
[1:56:30] any heaviness on the people or explain
[1:56:34] why things are the way. This is what
[1:56:36] happens.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; And we enter into a travail.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Maybe there's a loss of family or a
[1:56:42] loss of friends or a loss of whatever
[1:56:45] more. But and but it's in God's economy,
[1:56:48] there's no loss.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; The word of God is still absolutely
[1:56:54] true. No man can pluck mine out of my
[1:56:57] hand.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Is that it? Toot for finish. That's it.
[1:57:02] End of subject.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; All that the father hath given me shall
[1:57:07] come.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; And no man can pluck them out of my
[1:57:11] hand.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter whether they're in this
[1:57:13] church or another building. I don't care
[1:57:15] where they are in the world. God knows
[1:57:18] those that are his.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; And therein we rest. And therein our
[1:57:25] faith is perfect and complete.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And so if you notice in
[1:57:32] the last days, yes." And then he said,
[1:57:34] "So the church really is in birth pains
[1:57:37] tonight."
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; This is this day the scripture
[1:57:44] fulfilled.
[1:57:47] So the church is really in birth pains
[1:57:49] tonight again
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; for the deliverance
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; of the son
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; son of God to come again.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; All of our theologians, all of our
[1:58:02] systems, all of our denominations has
[1:58:05] rotted right out from under us.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:58:15] and let it be heard wherever people want
[1:58:17] to hear my voice. They've completely
[1:58:20] rotted out from under us. In my
[1:58:22] lifetime, I sat on a log in the
[1:58:25] wilderness and all of the systems and
[1:58:27] denominations and friendships and all
[1:58:30] the ministers I'd preach preached in
[1:58:32] their pulpits and whatever more. I
[1:58:35] became tainted
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; to them. I became tainted to me. I
[1:58:39] entered into a divine and glorious light
[1:58:42] and I counted nothing. I count it as
[1:58:45] just waste
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; that I might win Christ the word.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
[1:58:57] so we rejoice that things just rotted
[1:58:59] and and if people wanted to hang on to
[1:59:02] what was rotting and go, they have to go
[1:59:04] with it, I guess.
[1:59:09] So the church is really in birth pains
[1:59:11] and all the systems etc has rotted out
[1:59:15] right out from under us. So we are in
[1:59:17] birth pains
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; and a message from God always throws the
[1:59:22] church into heavier pain.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; So when a message if you say this is a
[1:59:28] message from God you must expect it will
[1:59:30] throw us into heavier pain. Amen.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Maybe we're not even there yet.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; But after a while,
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; she's going to be delivered of a bride.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; And that'll bring forth Jesus Christ to
[1:59:53] his bride.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; This rabbi said a little further, and
[1:59:56] I'm going to quit now. As the seed must
[1:59:59] rot before the tree can grow, and as a
[2:00:02] woman must labor before she can give
[2:00:04] birth, so must we undergo the pains of
[2:00:07] Messiah before redemption comes. The
[2:00:10] master of the world brings salvation
[2:00:13] through suffering. Therefore, we must
[2:00:15] accept that these pains and understand
[2:00:17] their significance. We must not re rebel
[2:00:20] against God, but perceive the mercy of
[2:00:23] his ways. This is an exalted form of
[2:00:26] mercy.
[2:00:32] We find ourselves in the midst of this
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; must realize that these are the pains of
[2:00:38] cleaving to God through nullifying our
[2:00:42] own existence.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Say if this is what I was called for,
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; so be it.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:53] Sister Glattus Dao said to brother
[2:00:55] Brandham on a car seat. She said,
[2:00:56] "Brother Brandham, are you going to be
[2:00:57] here for the rapture?" He said, "No, I'm
[2:01:02] going to be killed."
[2:01:04] He said, "It's kind of an explosion."
[2:01:07] He said, "It it might be a gunshot. I
[2:01:10] don't know, but I'll not be here for the
[2:01:12] rapture."
[2:01:15] You know what? at the question of a dear
[2:01:18] sister whose house I stayed in and I and
[2:01:21] my wife stayed there many times. I took
[2:01:23] her funeral.
[2:01:25] She was that kind of a person. Brother
[2:01:27] Bam, are you going to be here during the
[2:01:28] rapture
[2:01:32] and immediately? No. In other words,
[2:01:34] what is it? Nullifying oneself
[2:01:37] to the plan of God.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Moses, are you going to go into the
[2:01:41] promised land? No. you people rebelled
[2:01:44] and I call you rebels and I got angry
[2:01:47] and God just said that's it
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; and for that reason I'm not able to go
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; but Joshua will go my servant
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; and Joshua will lead you in
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus are you going to be here when the
[2:01:59] Holy Spirit know it's expedient for you
[2:02:02] that I go
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; if I don't go he won't come so I'm I'm
[2:02:06] ready to nullify myself
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; are you going to be here
[2:02:12] Hallelujah. And here we are to receive
[2:02:15] such a message and such a messenger
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; to show us the way and to tell us about
[2:02:19] that world over and over and over and
[2:02:21] over and over again until you say how
[2:02:23] many times you have to tell it. I
[2:02:25] haven't even told you all the time. I'm
[2:02:27] in two worlds. And I'm preaching about
[2:02:29] two worlds. And that's the world.
[2:02:31] There's none of this stuff that you're
[2:02:32] going to be all caught up in and
[2:02:34] burdened about tomorrow. It's all
[2:02:36] meaningless.
[2:02:38] the grocery and the shopping and all the
[2:02:40] fashions and everything else in the
[2:02:42] future. It's all there's no future with
[2:02:44] God. He's already passed that.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; He's eternal.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Isn't he wonderful?
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's so wonderful.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; I wonder, Linda, I wonder if you can
[2:03:01] come and play something for me.
[2:03:03] And I can't sing it, but maybe
[2:03:07] can you fire up these microphones and
[2:03:08] maybe we can get somebody to help us.
[2:03:12] Brother uh Ryan.
[2:03:18] I need Brother Ryan.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Glad for these gifts.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Do we have the words to uh the lights of
[2:03:30] home? Seems I can see.
[2:03:34] Seems I can hear the angel sack
[2:03:39] with hearts of gold and a thousand
[2:03:41] strength.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Earth holds no charms
[2:03:46] when I hear their sound.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Sweet bula. Bula is married.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Sweet bula land. Sweet married land.
[2:03:55] That's where the bride goes to the
[2:03:56] married land.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; My home. Sweet home.
[2:04:03] [Music]
[2:04:21] What's the first verse? How does the
[2:04:23] first verse start?
[2:04:31] [Music]
[2:04:41] My soul cries out.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; 961.
[2:04:46] Oh Lord, how long
[2:04:50] till my torn
[2:04:55] can you call me home
[2:05:00] since I
[2:05:04] [Music]
[2:05:05] in the sky?
[2:05:08] Nothing in this world
[2:05:13] keeps me sisfied.
[2:05:17] Is that the light
[2:05:22] of all my se
[2:05:25] [Music]
[2:05:26] I feel free
[2:05:30] from the crystal sea
[2:05:35] standing high
[2:05:38] on
[2:05:43] the lights
[2:05:47] It's a welcome to me.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that first verse once again.
[2:05:52] My soul cries
[2:05:57] [Music]
[2:06:00] till my joy begin
[2:06:05] and you call me
[2:06:09] since Heat. Heat.

[2:06:45] [Music]
[2:06:48] Hey,
[2:06:50] [Music]
[2:06:59] seems I can hear
[2:07:04] the angels sing
[2:07:09] along.
[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:20] When I hear this song
[2:07:23] [Music]
[2:07:25] you
[2:07:27] [Music]
[2:07:29] want
[2:07:30] [Music]
[2:07:45] [Music]
[2:07:46] to

[2:07:57] the lights of
[2:08:01] it's
[2:08:03] [Music]
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; I want to sing a verse again. by the
[2:08:10] verse. But I want to leave you this
[2:08:12] morning
[2:08:14] by telling you this is not a service.
[2:08:17] This is not just a service.
[2:08:20] This is more of an announcement of
[2:08:24] what's been laid before us. What's here
[2:08:27] in the messages
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; and that's been sent
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; to get you to move you forward towards
[2:08:33] this place. There's a place right now
[2:08:35] you say, "Well, is that tomorrow or the
[2:08:36] next day or the next week?" No, no, no.
[2:08:38] It's actually right now.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; You just have to resolve within yourself
[2:08:45] as I did this morning.
[2:08:48] There's a there's a place there's a
[2:08:50] place
[2:08:53] within the realm of this dimension, this
[2:08:57] other world. I want to move closer to
[2:09:00] it. I want it to impact this life. Amen.
[2:09:05] L
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; I want the significance of this life to
[2:09:08] be dictated by the importance the
[2:09:10] importance of this life to be dictated
[2:09:13] by that world.
[2:09:15] [Music]
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; It's hard. I know it's hard and we have
[2:09:21] a travail down here because our souls
[2:09:24] are crying out.
[2:09:26] There's something within you
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; and I would like you to find a release
[2:09:30] for that. Even this morning, we can't
[2:09:34] pray for individuals, but we'll pray for
[2:09:36] our each one together. I want to pray
[2:09:39] with you. And I'm going to pray
[2:09:42] earnestly and sincerely
[2:09:45] that God will let us not not just peer.
[2:09:47] I don't want it just to be instant. I
[2:09:49] don't want just some new things to be
[2:09:51] heard or some little further information
[2:09:53] to I I don't want that. I'm praying that
[2:09:57] it will just you'll just the whole
[2:10:00] congregation
[2:10:02] just move. I thought about a young man,
[2:10:06] Brother Daniel, you wrote me wrote in
[2:10:10] our anniversary and I appreciated that.
[2:10:17] I just desire that God would I desire
[2:10:19] with everything that's in me. I know
[2:10:20] it's right there.
[2:10:24] Otherwise, all these things are
[2:10:27] they're just in vain. These are just
[2:10:28] some more services. Where are these
[2:10:30] people that were listening to this?
[2:10:33] The God of your groaning.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Between 3 and 4 this morning. I rolled
[2:10:39] over and wrote that in the dark. The God
[2:10:41] you're groaning. The God of Moses
[2:10:44] groaning
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; met him in the bush.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I prayed, "Oh God, let the
[2:10:50] God of the desire within you, the God of
[2:10:52] your groaning come and meet you and say,
[2:10:55] I'm the God of Abraham. I'm the God of
[2:10:58] your forefathers." That's why you have
[2:11:00] that. I put that there.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; And like the prophet of God says, that
[2:11:04] desire, the desires that he's put in is
[2:11:07] us for him.
[2:11:08] Oh God,
[2:11:12] [Music]
[2:11:17] my soul cries out,
[2:11:21] "Oh Lord, how long
[2:11:26] till my
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; just reach out now?
[2:11:32] [Music]
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; Reach out.
[2:11:35] I can't I have
[2:11:40] my home in the sky.
[2:11:44] Nothing in this in this world.
[2:11:47] [Music]
[2:11:50] As a prayer will come
[2:11:57] of my
[2:12:01] to be free
[2:12:05] of the Christmas sea
[2:12:09] that stand.
[2:12:17] [Music]
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; I have a father. He knows my name
[2:12:28] though.
[2:12:34] I have
[2:12:36] a father.
[2:12:39] [Music]
[2:12:42] He calls me
[2:12:46] [Music]
[2:12:49] and you never
[2:12:51] leave me.
[2:12:55] No matter where I go,
[2:12:59] [Music]
[2:13:03] he knows my name.
[2:13:10] He knows my everywhere.
[2:13:15] [Music]
[2:13:24] And I
[2:13:30] have a way
[2:13:34] [Music]
[2:13:37] before
[2:13:38] my heart.
[2:13:43] And before even time began
[2:13:48] my life
[2:13:51] [Music]
[2:13:53] confession.
[2:13:58] My
[2:14:09] he
[2:14:12] [Music]
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; with our heads bowed. Heavenly Father,
[2:14:24] If you'd like to raise your hand,
[2:14:26] children,
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; you feel free to do so.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; God, you see my craving. You see the
[2:14:33] yearning. You see the depth of my
[2:14:35] desire.
[2:14:37] You see where it's taken me. You see
[2:14:39] where my hands have drooped down
[2:14:41] sometimes when I felt it was almost
[2:14:44] almost impossible for me to go any
[2:14:46] further. But yet, you were there. You
[2:14:48] knew my name and you called me.
[2:14:51] Lord Jesus, I pray for each each one of
[2:14:54] the precious loved ones,
[2:14:58] your children.
[2:15:00] How you must love them. You came, you
[2:15:03] suffered. You came into travail and you
[2:15:06] purchased them. You bought them as your
[2:15:09] own children. And now you have said and
[2:15:12] you told your disciples, I go to prepare
[2:15:14] a place for you. And if I go to prepare
[2:15:16] a place, I will come again and receive
[2:15:19] you.
[2:15:20] And you said to them, "A little while
[2:15:23] and you'll see me no more. And then a
[2:15:24] little while you'll see me. I know that
[2:15:27] that's troubled you. And I I know that
[2:15:29] you can't understand that." Oh God. Oh
[2:15:32] God. And then you come in this
[2:15:34] generation and you tell us so clearly.
[2:15:36] So clearly, Lord, I marvel. I marvel. It
[2:15:40] went on so long. Meeting after meeting,
[2:15:42] crossing the nation and crossing the
[2:15:44] world, crossing the earth. Meetings all
[2:15:47] over. And you showed yourself as a
[2:15:50] pillar of light in Germany. You showed
[2:15:52] yourself as a pillar of light in
[2:15:54] Houston, Texas. You showed yourself over
[2:15:57] the people, oh God. You're the same
[2:15:59] yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; And you're present here now. And that
[2:16:05] world is present here now. And you know
[2:16:08] our name.
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; You know each one of us. We had to be
[2:16:11] born in this season. You had each one of
[2:16:14] us conceived at a certain time so that
[2:16:17] we would be here now to glorify you.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Oh God. I pray you'll move the people
[2:16:25] from the to enter reality from these
[2:16:29] things that are visible and seen and are
[2:16:32] passing away. They're they're transient.
[2:16:35] They're just here for a moment and then
[2:16:37] we're moving on.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we're getting ready to go home.
[2:16:42] I pray father you'll do something very
[2:16:44] deep and very rich in this people as I
[2:16:48] sought to pour out my heart oh God to
[2:16:50] the people and to stay with the thought
[2:16:52] as you had given it
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; I pray father in the name of Jesus
[2:16:56] Christ you'll see our desires and move
[2:17:00] us oh God into a place of intimate
[2:17:03] fellowship divine with you
[2:17:07] Lord Jesus
[2:17:08] [Music]
[2:17:19] [Music]
[2:17:27] It was right in this birth pains.
[2:17:31] The prophet is speaking to the people
[2:17:32] about birth pains. He's speaking to us
[2:17:35] this morning about birth pains. our Lord
[2:17:37] Jesus.
[2:17:41] He said, "What?"
[2:17:44] And here's what he did.
[2:17:47] [Music]
[2:17:50] There's a woman, a stranger to me,
[2:17:54] never seen her,
[2:17:56] but she's got something wrong with one
[2:17:57] of her limbs.
[2:17:59] And that's your husband sitting next to
[2:18:01] you.
[2:18:03] You're not from here. You're from
[2:18:05] California and your name is Roland.
[2:18:07] [Music]
[2:18:11] There's a man, a colored man. Something
[2:18:14] wrong with his eyes.
[2:18:17] His work. He does something with a car.
[2:18:19] Polish his car. He's a car waxer.
[2:18:23] Your eyes are going bad.
[2:18:26] Your first name is Fred
[2:18:29] and your last name is Con.
[2:18:33] The man right behind there, he's not
[2:18:36] from here. From California, got a bad
[2:18:38] back. Mr. Owens, that's you. The Lord
[2:18:42] Jesus makes you well. I never seen you
[2:18:45] in my life.
[2:18:47] Little fella sitting here got a hernia,
[2:18:52] wearing glasses in a gray suit. Fred,
[2:18:56] God heals you if you believe it. Really
[2:19:00] accept it. Mrs. Holden sitting over
[2:19:03] there from him suffering with eye
[2:19:06] trouble. What are you crying for? You
[2:19:09] got a nervous breakdown, bronchitis,
[2:19:12] heart trouble. You believe that God will
[2:19:15] make you well. Sitting on the end of the
[2:19:17] seat there, you believe with all your
[2:19:19] heart Jesus Christ will make you well.
[2:19:22] All that nervousness will go from you.
[2:19:24] You feel like you're back to your right
[2:19:27] condition. The devil's lying to you. You
[2:19:30] accept it now. Rise up your hand. Raise
[2:19:33] up your hand and accept him. Okay, it's
[2:19:35] all over. He said, "What? This church is
[2:19:40] going through birth pain.
[2:19:43] Just finish that."
[2:19:45] No prayer line. Just finish that.
[2:19:49] I'm saying to this congregation and all
[2:19:51] who are listening,
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; this age entered into a birth pain
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; and the pains have gotten perhaps
[2:19:59] greater intensity and faster till one
[2:20:02] thing happens, another thing happens.
[2:20:04] Don't even consider it.
[2:20:08] Do you hear me?
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Don't even consider it.
[2:20:13] [Music]
[2:20:14] Don't get on all of this rasmatile. I
[2:20:17] can tell you, I tell you in the name of
[2:20:18] the Lord, if they would have had a
[2:20:21] Facebook years ago or if they would have
[2:20:23] had all this community uh connection
[2:20:25] years ago, uh the apostles would have
[2:20:28] been telling them it's not of this
[2:20:30] world. We have nothing to do with this
[2:20:32] world.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; All the science was a prophecy of the
[2:20:36] devil.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; Get enough education to get as much
[2:20:40] education as you need. I'm in favor of
[2:20:42] advanced education. That's fine to do
[2:20:44] whatever you need to do, but you live
[2:20:47] your life for God.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; All of these things, Peter says, shall
[2:20:53] be dissolved.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; That's this world.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; But in that world,
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; this kind of wisdom,
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; this kind of thing,
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; well, will it it it's timeless.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; And that's where you're going, children.
[2:21:09] Glory to God.
[2:21:13] I'm ending with this.
[2:21:20] God knew when William Brandon would be
[2:21:22] born.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; God happened to know when Roland was
[2:21:26] conceived. He happened to know when Fred
[2:21:28] Khan was conceived. He happened to know
[2:21:30] when Mr. Owens was conceived. He
[2:21:32] happened to know where when Mrs. Holden
[2:21:34] was conceived. This God happened to know
[2:21:37] all of that. And he had that happen so
[2:21:40] that they would be there at that moment
[2:21:42] for this messenger to call them out as
[2:21:44] evidence to us years later that here it
[2:21:47] is.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; The other world is here. It's present.
[2:21:50] Knows your name. He knew when you would
[2:21:52] be conceived. He knew when you would
[2:21:54] come. He knew what the craving would be
[2:21:56] in your heart. He put it there for this
[2:21:58] place.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; I say yay and amen.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; God raised us up. God knew when I would
[2:22:06] be conceived. God knew the direction and
[2:22:08] and the life and many sad things in my
[2:22:11] life and I won't even go into God knew
[2:22:14] that
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; God knew the hardships.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Probably 40 years a hardships and
[2:22:23] poverty,
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; not even knowing where I'd be sleeping
[2:22:27] sometime and make you ready for
[2:22:30] something that was in the future. God
[2:22:32] knew that I'd be troubled. God knew the
[2:22:35] craving and the travail that was gone
[2:22:37] within me. You haven't perhaps been
[2:22:39] there, but I was I was saying, "What's
[2:22:42] happening?
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; What's happening to this world of
[2:22:46] Pentecost? What's happening to this
[2:22:49] great Holy Spirit that's moving on the
[2:22:51] people anointed?" Yes. What's happening?
[2:22:54] And then there it is.
[2:22:57] four questions, four answers, four
[2:23:00] scriptures right here in this Bible that
[2:23:03] I had read hundreds of times.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Then what happened? A divine light
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; on this scripture.
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; What is it doing? It's fulfilling his
[2:23:13] purpose. That's what the the prophet of
[2:23:15] God sent to give light on this revealed
[2:23:18] Jesus Christ. And I can say I seen him,
[2:23:21] friends. I see him. And I want you to
[2:23:24] participate. You have participated.
[2:23:27] You've enjoyed it. But don't become
[2:23:29] burdened down. This travail has to
[2:23:32] happen.
[2:23:33] [Music]
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; This bride must give birth.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; God
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; as Ruth.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; As Ruth, the redeemed gentile bride
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; was redeemed by Boaz.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; The type of Christ gave her seed. We
[2:23:55] have had our Boaz has come in this
[2:23:58] season and he's already given us seed.
[2:24:01] [Music]
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; It's not the seed of another son of man
[2:24:06] coming to do miracles. It's the seed of
[2:24:08] the son of David
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; to sit on his throne
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; because that's another phase of the same
[2:24:15] part of redemption. And and friends,
[2:24:18] it's already in the process. That's why
[2:24:21] they went through a travail. That's why
[2:24:23] they went through a holocaust. That's
[2:24:25] why they went That's why this rabbi was
[2:24:27] shot
[2:24:29] of a few. He survived much of it. And
[2:24:31] then 1943 November shocked.
[2:24:37] He gave his life but taught the people
[2:24:40] and he said and he gave teaching to the
[2:24:43] young people to the children. Gave
[2:24:45] teaching to the young married couples.
[2:24:48] gave teaching to tell them that that
[2:24:51] that they should not be distressed that
[2:24:53] this uh these these afflictions have
[2:24:56] come. It's part of the redemption. And
[2:24:59] he was dead on. He said the seed must
[2:25:01] rot.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; And a prophet of God comes and tells us
[2:25:04] the seed must rot. And I've experienced
[2:25:07] that the seed is rotted, friends. And a
[2:25:10] new divine light has come and moving us
[2:25:13] to the rapture. This is of him. This is
[2:25:16] his work, not our work. This is his
[2:25:18] work.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; He started it and he shall finish it.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; He shall finish it.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; If we haven't got it just right, don't
[2:25:29] worry. He'll have it just right.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we haven't got the timing
[2:25:33] exactly right, he'll have the timing
[2:25:35] just exactly right.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:25:39] forever. Oh, friends, I hope you can
[2:25:42] taste and come and taste and see that
[2:25:44] the Lord is good. I feel beside myself.
[2:25:47] Participate. Say, "Oh God,
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; let me in on this."
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; This is real, friends.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; Your job will be dissolved.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; All of these associations and
[2:26:02] relationships will be dissolved. This
[2:26:05] world shall be dissolved. Amen.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; But that one,
[2:26:13] the prophet has told us, hasn't got
[2:26:16] automobiles and cars and
[2:26:20] gasoline and
[2:26:23] airplanes.
[2:26:25] None of those schedules.
[2:26:28] Oh, God help us.

[2:26:39] your name. He knew you'd be standing
[2:26:41] here. He knew you'd be in this service.
[2:26:43] He knew you'd be hearing these things
[2:26:45] cuz he's reaching out to you. Not me,
[2:26:47] him. He's reaching out to you saying, "I
[2:26:50] want you to know about me more. I want
[2:26:53] to come and walk with you."
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; I want to walk life path where you don't
[2:26:57] know tomorrow, but I do.

[2:27:01] might be there, but I do. I know all
[2:27:03] about it.
[2:27:08] I'm going to take you by the hand and
[2:27:10] lead you home.
[2:27:13] [Music]

[2:27:26] [Music]
[2:27:30] But what's that verse of that song?

[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; My road is winding.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; Your road. Your road.
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; But he can't see around.
[2:27:53] my pathway.
[2:27:55] [Music]

[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; He'll take me through

[2:29:02] to
[2:29:04] [Music]
[2:29:06] You know, God knew exactly when the one
[2:29:08] that's standing beside you would be
[2:29:09] conceived
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; and lead them, him, her to this service
[2:29:15] to stand beside you, be a part of the
[2:29:18] body of Jesus Christ.
