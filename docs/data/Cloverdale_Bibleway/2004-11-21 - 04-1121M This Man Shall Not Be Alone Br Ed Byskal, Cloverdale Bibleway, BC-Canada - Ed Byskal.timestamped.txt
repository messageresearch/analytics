[19:19] Jeffrey Meyers or Jeffrey, sorry, who's
[19:23] 17 years old, he has contacted a virus

[19:34] air airlifted him to St. John's
[19:36] Hospital. Uh, brother Guy went with him.
[19:39] He asked that the saints would pray that
[19:41] the Lord would undertake in this
[19:42] situation before the virus attacks the
[19:44] lungs. He's not serving the Lord. is
[19:47] just asking that God would speak to him
[19:49] at this time. And I'd also request um
[19:54] for my dad who's got uh they just
[19:56] discovered he's got a tumor uh this past
[19:59] week. He's going in for an operation the
[20:00] next two weeks. So would uh really
[20:04] request and cover covet your prayers and
[20:07] uh would appreciate that. How many have
[20:08] a need this morning? Amen. If you've got
[20:11] a need, would just take it before the
[20:13] Lord as we go to prayer if you're
[20:15] listening in. uh on the internet, on the
[20:17] phone lines, you just lift your hand
[20:20] before the Lord. He sees every need even
[20:22] before we ask. Brother did
[20:29] bow our hands.
[20:33] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[20:36] Father, even as we sang the song, we are
[20:39] here this morning to receive from your
[20:41] hand,
[20:43] knowing that you have given us a sure
[20:44] word of promise, Father, that when we
[20:48] assemble in your name and look to you,
[20:50] the lamb of God, you'll be there to
[20:53] minister to us, oh God,
[20:56] that's our deepest desire this morning,
[20:58] Father, to sit at your table, oh God,
[21:01] and to see you break the bread of life,
[21:05] Lord, to open our eyes and anoint them
[21:07] with eyes that we might see you. Oh God,
[21:10] we desire to enter into the secret
[21:13] chamber behind the veil where the world,
[21:15] oh God, is silenced on the outside where
[21:18] our hearts can commune with you
[21:20] oneon-one. Father, we believe that you
[21:23] have prepared your servant already this
[21:25] morning. You have given him that which
[21:26] we have need of. Father, so we come, oh
[21:29] God, just to open our hearts, to lift up
[21:32] our empty hands to you, sing nothing we
[21:35] bring, oh God, only to your cross we
[21:37] desire to cling. May you drop down in
[21:39] our midst, oh God, even as we have
[21:41] welcomed you with the songs of Zion this
[21:44] morning, Lord, come and minister to
[21:46] every life. Come and touch us, oh God.
[21:49] Come and fill us with your spirit to
[21:51] overflowing. We desire to be of service
[21:53] to you, oh God. We ask that you'll take
[21:56] your servant and just anoint him in a
[21:58] special way this morning. Yes. Oh God,
[22:01] put all the effort he can in this
[22:03] service. But how our efforts are in vain
[22:06] unless the Holy Spirit comes and take
[22:08] full charge. We know that he depends on
[22:11] you this morning. Lord, may you anoint
[22:13] him, Father. May you give him liberty,
[22:15] oh God. May you just open our hearts
[22:17] that we can pull on the word that this
[22:20] morning may be a Holy Ghost meeting in
[22:22] your presence, Father. That's what our
[22:25] hearts are hungry and thirsty for this
[22:27] morning, Lord. You promise to ask that
[22:30] those that hunger and thirst after
[22:32] righteousness, they shall be filled. Oh
[22:35] God, and for the needs in your presence
[22:37] this morning, our brother Nelson guide
[22:40] for his nephew. We believe, oh God,
[22:42] you're the maker of the body. As the
[22:44] saints of God, unite the hearts this
[22:46] morning. And we pray on their behalf.
[22:49] Father, we just believe that you're more
[22:51] than able to deliver this young one and
[22:54] to bring his body back in order, oh God,
[22:57] to restore his immunity, Father, to
[22:59] fight this virus, oh God. And for our
[23:01] brother Rod, Father, this morning, we
[23:04] know you've been so faithful to our
[23:06] brother over the years. You've proven
[23:08] yourself as the mighty Jehovah Rafa, oh
[23:11] God. Once more, we pray this morning
[23:14] that you'll touch his father. Oh God,
[23:16] that you deliver him. Oh father, that
[23:18] you direct the hand of the surgeon. Oh
[23:20] God, for you are the healer. Father,
[23:23] they can only remove the turor, but you
[23:25] are the healer, oh God. And we believe
[23:28] that you move on his behalf. This
[23:30] morning, we want to yield oursel to you,
[23:32] Father. We want you to have your liberty
[23:34] in our midst, Father. We want every
[23:36] hindrance to be removed. We want your
[23:39] children to be raised, oh God, in a
[23:41] realm of faith and expectation that this
[23:43] meeting will not be in vain. Father,
[23:46] that will not come out empty, oh God,
[23:48] but return to our home rejoicing because
[23:50] our heart did burn along the way as you
[23:53] spoke to us this day. Father, may you
[23:55] direct us in the song and the words in
[23:58] everything this morning. May you have
[24:00] your blessed way. This service is yours.
[24:03] Take full control in Jesus name. Amen.
[24:06] Amen.

[31:04] And uh we have just so much so much to
[31:08] be thankful for and so much that's
[31:09] taking place.
[31:11] Uh just a week ago, our brother Timothy
[31:16] Ma after about 2 months in Vietnam and
[31:20] he's back. We haven't even heard much
[31:22] from him at all.
[31:25] Brother Timothy was sick for about two
[31:27] weeks Vietnam.
[31:29] And uh but he just kept plowing forward
[31:33] and we're so thankful for that.
[31:37] Brother Murphy and Sister Tracy just got
[31:41] back Friday,
[31:44] two and a half months in China. Just
[31:47] almost wore out, just going from one
[31:50] work to another, one place to another.
[31:53] And I'm so thankful that we're able to
[31:56] have a part. You know, this is
[31:58] sovereign.
[31:59] It's not something that's been
[32:00] engineered by man. We didn't hear from
[32:04] some earthly headquarters that said go
[32:06] and do this. Go and you know some kind
[32:10] of human strategy or agenda has been
[32:12] God. And this congregation wants to be
[32:15] aware of that.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; We want to say praise God
[32:19] &gt;&gt; who's guiding us by the Holy Spirit. And
[32:23] our brother Tony and sister Rebecca
[32:26] having just arrived back also. They were
[32:29] in India and had services also in Kuwait
[32:33] and Iran
[32:35] and I saw some just some still pictures
[32:38] last night of the groups in Iran and I
[32:42] can tell you it touched my heart and
[32:44] you're going to be moved. You don't want
[32:46] to miss the meeting. We don't know just
[32:49] when that will be as yet. believers
[32:53] scattered and sprinkled all through that
[32:57] country, that Muslim country. And I'm
[32:59] conscious this morning of something
[33:01] happening, something taking place. And
[33:04] in the service this morning, we have our
[33:06] brother Mustafa
[33:08] who is going to I want to have let him
[33:11] have a half an hour tonight before the
[33:16] service, before the preaching service.
[33:19] So that's why we're starting early.
[33:21] I don't want to I think it would be a
[33:24] crime to uh not give our brother
[33:28] sufficient time because our brother
[33:30] Aaron McGary who just stood up a moment
[33:32] ago, he's going to be ministering for us
[33:34] tonight. Brother Aaron's father is
[33:36] pastor in Dallas in Texas there. And our
[33:40] brother Aaron ministers and travels
[33:43] considerably and ministers. So, he's
[33:45] going to be ministering tonight. But I
[33:47] want our brother Mustafa to be able to
[33:49] tell us something of his background. And
[33:52] I believe it's no accident that our
[33:55] brother Mustafa has been granted the
[33:59] only publishing license for Christian
[34:03] literature in Turkey.
[34:06] Uh he's has a license for the only
[34:09] Christian radio station in that Muslim
[34:12] nation.
[34:14] and his he he will tell you of his
[34:16] vision tonight. He will tell you of how
[34:19] God brought him to Christ to salvation
[34:22] from a Muslim background
[34:24] and uh the dangers that they have
[34:27] experienced.
[34:28] Uh our brother's well educated but God
[34:31] has got a hold of his heart and how God
[34:34] led him and brought him. He'd been he'
[34:37] been it's been uh just an unbelievable
[34:41] network that only God can put together
[34:44] that brought him to the knowledge of the
[34:46] message just recently. And uh so he will
[34:50] be giving you something of his
[34:52] background,
[34:54] how the 1980 coup affected his family.
[34:58] His father was arrested and imprisoned
[35:01] for two years. I believe his father was
[35:04] also in the government. uh had some
[35:06] government position
[35:08] and then his his burden now because if
[35:12] God opens the doors as we trust he will,
[35:16] he would like to
[35:18] have his uh the the station needs to be
[35:21] increased in power and with more
[35:25] um towers so it'll be able to reach
[35:29] uh the first is the nation of of Turkey
[35:34] because you would need some their towers
[35:36] to from which to send a signal and then
[35:39] from the eastern part of the nation
[35:42] because they border right on Iran and
[35:44] Iraq and so on and if they have if they
[35:47] have towers there it'll be able to reach
[35:49] the entire Middle East and God is uh I
[35:54] said that we would be you know we
[35:56] certainly would be praying towards this
[35:58] end and uh doing what we can do in that
[36:01] direction because when I see something
[36:05] happening that man has not engineered,
[36:08] then I say that's God that's doing it.
[36:12] And and that God would allow the
[36:14] congregation here in the church here.
[36:17] And we can see I mean, you know, uh our
[36:19] brothers here today, Brother Tony just
[36:22] got back. They've had this connection.
[36:25] our our our brother Matthew Dertie, I
[36:29] think, was in a state of shock to see
[36:31] what was happening in his country of
[36:34] Iran. And uh and then to find that the
[36:37] gospel and you know, was reaching his
[36:39] own sister over there who knew nothing
[36:42] of what brother Tony and sister Rebecca
[36:45] were. I you know, friends, I mean, this
[36:48] is the supernatural. Write it in the
[36:50] book of Acts.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Just write it in the book of Acts. We
[36:53] don't want to be uh you know dull of
[36:56] mind, dull of ears and dull of hearing.
[37:00] Want to say this is God.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Remember God has done many things all
[37:06] through the centuries that the people
[37:07] failed to grasp till he was long gone.
[37:11] And then they said, "Isn't Elijah
[37:12] supposed to come? Isn't there supposed
[37:13] to be a rapture? Isn't there supposed to
[37:14] be resurrection?" Brother Bram said,
[37:16] "It'll all be passed
[37:18] &gt;&gt; and there'll still be a gathering in
[37:20] church. Don't you be one of those. Amen.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; There'll probably be people coming to
[37:25] this church after it's all over. Said,
[37:27] "Isn't this supposed to isn't that
[37:28] supposed to happen?" Well, I don't plan
[37:31] to be here. We're here now. We're going
[37:34] to do everything we can now.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; And if you can't do anything more than
[37:38] pray, just pray earnestly that God will
[37:41] move in a mighty way, in a sovereign
[37:43] way, not only over there, but here as
[37:45] well.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:48] All right. I'd like to just sing that
[37:51] chorus. Perhaps we'll sing it once
[37:54] again. Uh but I'd like to sing another
[37:56] chorus as well. It's a older course
[38:00] until you know
[38:03] his loving hand that reaches out to
[38:05] fallen man. And that's what I'm glad he
[38:07] reached out to this fallen man. Aren't
[38:10] you glad?
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We were fallen friends and
[38:15] fallen beyond
[38:17] help till he reached out his hand for
[38:20] us.
[38:22] until you know the man that reaches down
[38:29] to fallen man and fix him up from the
[38:35] sin where he has
[38:41] until you know just how it is to know
[38:46] that God is
[38:53] until you know the love of God. Isn't he
[38:57] wonderful?
[38:59] Oh, until you know the blood
[39:04] that reaches down to fallen man
[39:11] from out of s where he has brought
[39:18] until he
[39:22] to know that God is really
[39:26] [Music]
[39:30] until you know.
[39:37] Hallelujah. God bless you. If you'll
[39:39] take your Bibles, please turn to First
[39:41] Corinthians the 12th chapter.
[39:56] We'll read.
[40:01] We're going to read there. Before I read
[40:05] a 1 Corinthians 12, hold your finger
[40:08] there. And I'm going to read u some
[40:11] selected verses out of Genesis 2
[40:21] verse 18.
[40:25] And carrying on from Wednesday night.
[40:27] For those of you that were not here
[40:29] Wednesday, it might be a little more
[40:31] difficult for you to kind of follow, but
[40:33] I'll try to make it as clear as
[40:34] possible.
[40:36] And the Lord God said, "It is not good
[40:42] that the man should be alone.
[40:45] I will make him an helpmate for him."
[40:50] Verse 21.
[40:52] And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[40:54] fall upon Adam, and he slept. And he
[40:58] took one of his ribs, and closed up the
[41:00] flesh instead thereof.
[41:02] And the rib which the Lord God had taken
[41:05] from man, made he a woman, and brought
[41:09] her unto the man.
[41:16] A scripture that you're all familiar
[41:18] with
[41:20] tells us in Luke, "And it shall," and as
[41:23] it was in the days of Noah, so shall it
[41:28] be also in the days of the son of man.
[41:31] They did eat, they drank, they married
[41:33] wives. They were given in marriage until
[41:36] the day that Noah entered into the ark,
[41:38] and the flood came and destroyed them
[41:40] all. Likewise also as it was in the days
[41:44] of Lot, they did eat, they drank, they
[41:46] bought, they sold, they planted, they
[41:48] builded, but the same day that Lot went
[41:51] out of Sodom, it rained fire and
[41:53] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[41:56] all. Even thus shall it be in the day
[41:59] when the Son of Man is revealed. That's
[42:01] the son I'm talking about.
[42:04] It's not good for man to be alone.
[42:08] And this is the man I'm speaking of.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; The day when this man was revealed
[42:14] &gt;&gt; and the God, this was the second Adam
[42:17] says it's not good for him to be alone.
[42:20] I will make for him a wife.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is God's doing and it's
[42:28] marvelous in our eyes. And Paul speaking
[42:31] about this body said in 1 Corinthians
[42:34] 12:12,
[42:36] "For as the body is one and hath many
[42:40] members, and all the members of that one
[42:42] body, being many, are one body, so also
[42:46] is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all
[42:50] baptized into one body, whether we be
[42:54] Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or
[42:57] free, and have been all made to drink
[43:00] into one body. For the body is for the
[43:04] body is not one member, but many. God
[43:08] bless you. You may be seated.
[43:14] Pray now that our
[43:18] gracious heavenly father will make clear
[43:20] the word to us as we speak
[43:25] the ministry
[43:27] of uh our Lord Jesus.
[43:31] He referenced he used the reference son
[43:34] of man
[43:37] uh
[43:39] not many times. I think around 70 times
[43:44] concerning himself
[43:46] in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[43:50] In his revealing in this day, brother
[43:52] Brandham made reference to the son of
[43:54] man over a thousand times.
[43:59] And it was significant that he should do
[44:01] that because this is the time of his
[44:03] revealing.
[44:05] He used the term for the first time that
[44:09] I have been able to find was in the
[44:12] message the angel of God in 1948.
[44:18] And he now is
[44:22] uh bringing forward
[44:24] God through the prophet vessel
[44:28] is beginning to make known the ministry
[44:32] of the son of man.
[44:34] And that ministry now is going out to
[44:37] the individual
[44:39] people and he's drawing an example from
[44:43] the scripture where Jesus is coming to
[44:47] the man who he is going to tell him the
[44:52] man in the at the pool of Bethesda and
[44:55] he's going to speak to him and the man
[44:59] is telling Jesus I have no one to put me
[45:02] in the
[45:04] But the the the thought I want you to
[45:07] lay hold of is that he's speaking now
[45:10] one person Jesus Christ speaking to one
[45:14] man as an individual to an individual
[45:18] and he's revealing himself as the son of
[45:21] man and uh he said take up your bed and
[45:24] walk. When Jesus was questioned, and
[45:27] brother, this is what brother Brandham
[45:29] is speaking of. When he was questioned,
[45:31] he told those that were questioning him
[45:34] that the son of man could do nothing
[45:38] except what he seen the father doing
[45:41] before. So what he sees the father do,
[45:45] so doeth the son likewise, the son of
[45:49] man. That was his brother Brandham's
[45:52] first instance of the use of that term.
[45:56] His last one is in the very last
[45:59] gathering he has
[46:01] which is communion
[46:03] in 65
[46:06] after the entire ministry is all
[46:08] finished. But now it is not a oneonone.
[46:13] He's not describing a ministry of one
[46:17] person to an individual. But now in in
[46:21] the communion, he's saying that we do
[46:25] this
[46:27] because that we are giving thanks to him
[46:31] and among one another,
[46:33] eating bread between each other. See,
[46:37] it's not individual now. Now it's a
[46:40] community. It's a group. and wine
[46:43] between each other as his blood and his
[46:47] flesh. And then he quotes, "Except you
[46:50] eat the flesh of the son of man, you
[46:54] have no life in you." The last time he
[46:56] used the phrase, now it has gone from a
[47:01] ministry to from one to one. Now he's
[47:05] brought it into a community.
[47:08] This is a body. We are eating bread with
[47:11] one another.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; We are drinking the wine with one
[47:15] another. And except you eat the flesh of
[47:18] the son of man. So this revealing of the
[47:20] son of man, God has has taken it and it
[47:23] has evolved from one to the community to
[47:30] the union uh rather the the gathering of
[47:33] the people the body
[47:36] and I think that is very significant.
[47:40] uh there is a a thought that's well
[47:44] known
[47:46] in uh this generation
[47:49] which usually I think is used to
[47:52] describe
[47:54] uh political persuasion someone who may
[47:57] be persuaded one way or another and it's
[48:00] individualism or collectivism
[48:03] and individualism
[48:05] is thought more uh I think tends more to
[48:09] democracy
[48:10] while collectivism tends more to the
[48:14] communist or communism and incidentally
[48:17] I don't think that communism as we
[48:21] understand it or as you know it and
[48:23] nations who have identified themelves as
[48:26] communist I personally and this my own
[48:29] personal thought believe it's the
[48:31] highest form of capitalism because it's
[48:34] only a handful of people that hold all
[48:37] the wealth at least in democracy Y uh
[48:41] and and which tends towards
[48:43] individualism
[48:44] the the uh you know the the individual
[48:48] is free and of course there's various
[48:50] levels of thought along that line but uh
[48:54] uh those that have in a democratic
[48:57] society they feel that we have a certain
[48:59] collectivism as well because you go and
[49:02] vote for who you want and the the
[49:04] majority wins and that's who goes into
[49:08] power. And so in one sense it has been a
[49:11] collective movement. On the other hand,
[49:13] it's an individual. Everybody has the
[49:15] the you know the honor of the
[49:18] individual. They can go as far as they
[49:20] want and go as high as they want and
[49:23] earn as much money as they want and live
[49:25] as high as they want or or go out in the
[49:27] woods and get lost if they want to and
[49:30] and live as a hermit. Whatever the
[49:32] individual wants to do, that's what's
[49:34] respected. And I find that in the
[49:37] individual and you'll see you might say,
[49:39] "Well, why did you swing this way?"
[49:41] Well, because that's exactly what we
[49:43] started in the ministry of the son of
[49:45] man. It just starts with individual.
[49:47] This person, that woman, that man, this
[49:49] person over here, but at the end of the
[49:51] ministry, I want you to see that it's
[49:54] not the individual. It is it is the
[49:57] collective body and it is for the
[50:00] betterment of the body. Uh we are not
[50:03] within the body of Christ. uh permitted
[50:05] to do just what we want to do. We are we
[50:09] are called to do what is for the benefit
[50:12] of the whole body
[50:13] &gt;&gt; and that is what's important you see.
[50:16] And so uh we have we don't want our
[50:20] understanding of the scripture be t to
[50:22] be tainted with what is uh what is known
[50:25] in the world as being individualism or
[50:28] collectivism because you know the thing
[50:30] is even within the body of Christ. It's
[50:33] not a democracy and neither is it
[50:35] communism as we understand it. And yet
[50:38] we are to have things in common. uh uh a
[50:42] lot of you have come from colonies where
[50:44] which were based on uh and from the
[50:47] scripture and they had all things in
[50:48] common and you know that they don't have
[50:51] that in the in the uh community of the
[50:54] colonies because only a few just exactly
[50:57] like the communist nations only a few
[50:59] held all the wealth and all the power
[51:01] and all the authority and all the
[51:02] decisionmaking was just in the hands of
[51:05] a very few that's not having all things
[51:07] in common. That's not the way it works.
[51:10] I'm glad for the for the community that
[51:14] was birthed on the day of Pentecost
[51:16] which is under the leadership of the
[51:18] Holy Spirit.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; So we're not we're not just individuals.
[51:26] We don't do and we cannot be. We are a
[51:29] part of a body.
[51:32] uh in the rapture message prophet said
[51:35] you are a part of God because you're an
[51:38] attribute of God. So God doesn't think
[51:41] of of us and we and he does not deal
[51:43] with us and does not look upon us as
[51:46] being just a a a loose gathering of
[51:51] people but we are a functioning body
[51:55] dependent upon one another and interact
[51:58] with one another. this world now would
[52:01] have you, you know, because because of
[52:04] the society that we live in. You can
[52:06] live in your own little sphere. I can
[52:08] live in my own little sphere. We can
[52:10] come here under one roof, etc., and and
[52:13] and mingle around for a while and shake
[52:15] hands and smile at one another. That's
[52:17] not what God has in mind as a body. He
[52:21] has a he has in mind a body that is
[52:24] integrally integral with one another. We
[52:27] interact with one another. We are to be
[52:30] concerned about one another. We are to
[52:33] be affectionate to one another. We are
[52:35] to love one another. And we're to
[52:39] understand that this body operates for
[52:41] the benefit of the body. We cannot look
[52:44] upon one another and see someone in need
[52:46] and have our bowels uh closed up, our
[52:49] bowels of compassion. And yet on the
[52:52] other hand, we find that there are those
[52:54] that in this society that we've been
[52:57] raised into that believe in
[52:59] individualism. They go off on, you know,
[53:02] on their uh they they believe what they
[53:04] believe. They may be believers of the
[53:06] message, but they live a very
[53:07] individualistic life until disaster
[53:10] comes and suddenly they believe in the
[53:12] community.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; You know, great collapse, great collapse
[53:19] of some kind. Maybe when they were
[53:21] healthy and strong and all the rest,
[53:22] they're just roaring ahead. You don't
[53:24] hardly see them and suddenly they're
[53:26] sick. Oh, they want everybody to know.
[53:29] Pray for me now. You know, come to my
[53:31] aid. Well, that's fine. And that's what
[53:33] we're supposed to do. But the thing is,
[53:35] we need to know ahead of time that
[53:37] that's not the that's not the order of
[53:39] the day. That's not the way this body
[53:42] functions.
[53:44] go roaring ahead and just, you know,
[53:46] have great financial success and then
[53:48] have a financial collapse. When they
[53:50] were going ahead, they didn't they
[53:52] didn't they weren't committed to the
[53:54] body at all.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; But then when disaster came, suddenly
[53:58] they're happy. There's this this
[54:01] community feeling of the body come to my
[54:03] aid. We want to have that revelation
[54:07] long before
[54:08] &gt;&gt; that happens.
[54:10] And so you are a part
[54:13] in the invisible union. He said the
[54:16] anointed word of his day of which you
[54:19] are a part by predestination. You are a
[54:22] part by predestination of the anointed
[54:26] word in the message God's power to
[54:28] transform. You are a part of the word
[54:31] because he was the word at the beginning
[54:35] and you are the word now. Amen.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; You're a part of the word and he and
[54:41] when you saw the word and see the word
[54:43] function and have the record of how the
[54:45] word function and operated, we are a
[54:48] part of the same word.
[54:52] All right. Now,
[54:55] uh
[54:58] I have a couple of
[55:00] quotes here just on individualism and
[55:03] collectivism. I'd like to just drop it
[55:05] in and then I want to move on.
[55:07] Individualism holds that the individual
[55:11] is the primary unit of reality
[55:15] and the ultimate standard of value.
[55:18] That's individualism.
[55:20] And collectiv collectivism holds that
[55:24] the group the race or nation the
[55:29] community could be the church or the
[55:32] movement whatever etc is the primary
[55:36] unit of reality in the ultimate standard
[55:41] of
[55:43] value.
[55:44] One is individualism other is
[55:47] collectivism.
[55:49] How does this relate to the scripture?
[55:52] Well, we find very very early when God
[55:56] began to speak to one person whose name
[55:59] was Cain and God said, where's your
[56:02] brother?
[56:04] And the common phrase that's quoted so
[56:07] many times, am I my brother's keeper?
[56:11] Am I responsible for my brother? God
[56:14] wouldn't have asked if he hadn't been
[56:15] responsible. Am I my brother's keeper?
[56:19] The truth of the matter is yes. We are
[56:21] our brother's keeper.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; That's how the body functions.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; We can't be just isolated in our little
[56:29] own sphere. We are our brother's keeper.
[56:32] This is a body. It's a functioning body.
[56:37] And we have I have much to say about
[56:39] about that today. And the Lord said,
[56:43] "Where is thy brother Abel, thy
[56:45] brother?" In Romans,
[56:49] Paul says, "Therefore, if thine enemy
[56:52] hunger," so it goes beyond the body. "If
[56:56] thy enemy hunger, do what? Feed him."
[57:01] &gt;&gt; If thy enemy thirst, give him to drink.
[57:05] This isn't your friend. This isn't
[57:08] somebody go to church with.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; This isn't something someone who did you
[57:12] a favor or had you over and now you have
[57:15] them over. This is not reciprocal.
[57:19] That's not what it is. This is if he's
[57:21] your enemy. If he's done you wrong, if
[57:25] he's trying to do you wrong. If he's
[57:27] trying to act deceitful and he's hungry,
[57:30] feed him.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; There should have been a bigger amen to
[57:34] that. I'm reading what Paul said. This
[57:37] is the doctrine. This isn't a good idea.
[57:40] This isn't an option. This is a
[57:43] doctrine.
[57:54] Fact is, I can say today that probably
[57:56] in the society we live in, there's a
[57:59] whole lot of coals that are never heaped
[58:01] upon a person's head because the thing
[58:04] isn't practiced.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; And if there were coals upon a person's
[58:12] head, perhaps they would react
[58:14] differently.
[58:18] Brother Brham talks about
[58:20] democracy and this isn't a this isn't a
[58:24] a message on politics at all but he says
[58:26] we can't look to democracy.
[58:29] Now it was right
[58:32] but it's it's run it but it's run it's
[58:35] lived its life. Kings live their life
[58:39] and kingdoms and dictators and all have
[58:43] lived their day. Democracy, excuse me,
[58:46] democracy was the best thing they had,
[58:50] but it's polluted through with politics.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; It's rotten to the core.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; You still believe he's prophet.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; No hopes on it at all.
[59:02] And he says, "You're just like trying to
[59:05] build on a charred cities that's burnt
[59:09] to smolders. You can't build it. It's
[59:12] ruined and gone. And it has to be that
[59:15] way. It must come that way. The Bible
[59:18] says it'll be that way. He said Satan is
[59:21] the ruler
[59:23] of every nation. And I will say both
[59:26] democratic and communist. Every nation,
[59:31] &gt;&gt; however, they're run by a dictator or by
[59:33] a voted in government or whatever more.
[59:36] As far as our position is concerned
[59:39] spiritually, because politics has
[59:42] corrupted it. Amen.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Both democratic. He said every kingdom
[59:47] belongs to Satan and he rules them
[59:50] according to his own way of ruling.
[59:54] But this body of believers, it is a
[59:57] collective body.
[59:59] But it is a it is a gathering. It is a
[1:00:03] collective body. not by collectivism as
[1:00:06] as is understood by our theories or our
[1:00:12] understanding
[1:00:14] uh in in a in a worldly sense as far as
[1:00:17] the world is concerned. Our collective
[1:00:20] body of believers is called the body of
[1:00:23] Christ.
[1:00:25] It is called the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:00:29] And that's quite a different body. And
[1:00:31] that's the one I'm talking about. The
[1:00:33] bride of Jesus Christ sounds good to me.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; The lamb's wife sounds very good to me.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; This is the body. And it and it is a
[1:00:46] body that understands the the community.
[1:00:50] It should understand the community. It
[1:00:53] should understand collectivism in its
[1:00:55] purest sense. And Jesus practiced it.
[1:00:59] The early church practiced it. But we we
[1:01:03] need to understand it uh in in a pure
[1:01:06] way.
[1:01:08] The bride body
[1:01:11] is the product of the creative word of
[1:01:17] God. And in this end time, God has begun
[1:01:22] moving in a supernatural way through a
[1:01:27] prophet vessel. And I described at the
[1:01:30] beginning just to set your thought in
[1:01:32] this way began moving through that
[1:01:34] prophet vessel dealing with just the
[1:01:37] individuals. So we could s call that
[1:01:39] individualism.
[1:01:41] But as that ministry progressed, it
[1:01:44] became collective.
[1:01:46] It was to the body of Jesus Christ. I
[1:01:49] don't call you church anymore. I call
[1:01:51] you bride as I ended up Wednesday. Not
[1:01:55] just a nice phrase. Not something just
[1:01:58] to make people feel good. Not not just
[1:02:01] to make them feel a exclusive and a a
[1:02:06] very special unit. While that is true,
[1:02:09] but that's not why he said it. He said
[1:02:11] it because in his ministry it was moving
[1:02:14] the very the very force of God. The
[1:02:17] logos word that was coming out of his
[1:02:20] mouth he saw was making a distinct uh uh
[1:02:24] it it was working according to the
[1:02:27] divine uh purpose of God um in the
[1:02:31] people and he could see that a bride a
[1:02:34] body of Christ was taking shape
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; out of the humanity which is the earth.
[1:02:40] and that God was creating a wife for the
[1:02:44] for the for Jesus Christ
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; for the man Jesus Christ
[1:02:52] and God the Lord God said
[1:02:56] it's not good that man
[1:02:58] should be alone and I will make him a
[1:03:01] helpmate
[1:03:04] for him.
[1:03:07] That is what has incidentally been
[1:03:10] happening.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; The making
[1:03:14] God has been making.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; This is not uh an arrangement of
[1:03:21] of of programs. We'll have a program.
[1:03:25] We'll have a program for the youth.
[1:03:27] We'll have a program for the school.
[1:03:29] We'll have a program of Sunday school.
[1:03:31] We'll have a program for the young
[1:03:33] couples. We'll have a program for the
[1:03:35] singles. We'll have a program and all
[1:03:38] these programs put together and somehow
[1:03:40] we get a a a group of people could be a
[1:03:43] thousand, 2,000 or 10,000. It wouldn't
[1:03:46] necessarily have anything to do with the
[1:03:49] body of Christ. But when God by his
[1:03:52] spirit works through his servant and
[1:03:56] sends his word,
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; a message into a generation, a a certain
[1:04:02] point in time, that that point in time
[1:04:05] becomes pivotal
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; because now God is speaking. That is why
[1:04:11] I showed you on Wednesday night, and for
[1:04:13] those of you that were here, this will
[1:04:15] sound repetitive, but if you just excuse
[1:04:18] me a moment, God begins dealing with
[1:04:21] Adam, one man. And then then he begins
[1:04:25] after the fall, that man fell. God
[1:04:28] begins to build and he calls one man,
[1:04:31] once again, we could say that was
[1:04:33] individualism. calls one man out of all
[1:04:36] the earth.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; And he's the man who has the blessing of
[1:04:39] God. I will bless you.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; I will bless your seed.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you individual this
[1:04:47] land. But then out from him comes Isaac.
[1:04:50] And out from Isaac comes Jacob. And out
[1:04:53] from Jacob comes the 12 patriarchs. But
[1:04:56] in the very beginning, God in his mind,
[1:04:58] he didn't have just the individual in
[1:05:00] mind. He had the whole collective body
[1:05:02] in mind.
[1:05:04] And he was saying it's not good. He was
[1:05:06] expressing his own his own uh desire.
[1:05:10] And brother Brandham said his desire was
[1:05:13] his attributes. He had desires to
[1:05:16] express this attribute. And he he the
[1:05:19] prophet said he loved fatherhood.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He had that attribute within
[1:05:25] him. He didn't have any sons. He didn't
[1:05:28] have any daughters. He didn't have any
[1:05:30] family. and out into the out of the eons
[1:05:33] of eternity. But yet, he had that
[1:05:35] desire. Why it happened at this point, I
[1:05:38] don't know. Well, why it didn't happen
[1:05:41] several trillion years ago, I don't
[1:05:43] know. God always was in existence. But I
[1:05:46] do know that we didn't come here by
[1:05:48] accident. We came here by a mighty uh
[1:05:51] creator of heavens and earth. Uh we are
[1:05:54] created in his image and we have a
[1:05:56] desire that is similar to his desire. He
[1:05:59] wanted a a body. He wanted a family. He
[1:06:02] wanted a marriage. He wanted a a unit.
[1:06:05] He wanted a family. He desired this
[1:06:08] family. And when he called one man, he
[1:06:10] began to deal with him because he wanted
[1:06:13] to bring out this family. And his arc
[1:06:16] enemy slipped in and caused that first
[1:06:19] Adam to fall. And God begin to build.
[1:06:21] And he begins to lay a foundation. He
[1:06:24] lays a cornerstone down. And it's a
[1:06:26] Abraham a faith. And he lays another
[1:06:29] corner down, Isaac. And he lays another
[1:06:32] corner down, Jacob. And he lays another
[1:06:34] fourth corner down for his masterpiece.
[1:06:37] And that's Joseph. And he's got the four
[1:06:40] corners of the monument that he's going
[1:06:42] to build. And now he begins. And the 12
[1:06:45] patriarchs come. Now he's been dealing
[1:06:47] with the individual, one man. Now he
[1:06:49] comes. He's got the four corners of the
[1:06:52] masterpiece coming. And out of there
[1:06:54] come now tribes and clans. Now it's
[1:06:58] become collective and out of that then
[1:07:00] finally he calls them because as Jacob
[1:07:03] wrestles with the angel of the Lord say
[1:07:05] I'm not going to call you Jacob anymore
[1:07:07] you're not going to be a deceiver
[1:07:09] anymore you're going to be called Israel
[1:07:12] and those that came out now they have a
[1:07:14] different status going to call you now
[1:07:16] the children of Israel you're the
[1:07:19] children of this man the children of
[1:07:21] Israel and then he raises up a prophet
[1:07:23] and calls them out of bondage according
[1:07:25] to his word by Abra Abraham and takes
[1:07:28] them out of Egypt into the wilderness
[1:07:31] and begins to hover over them. Watch
[1:07:33] over them. Make sure their shoes don't
[1:07:35] wear out. Make sure their garments don't
[1:07:38] get old. Make sure they have food coming
[1:07:40] down every day fresh from heaven. Make
[1:07:43] sure they have fresh water. 2 million
[1:07:45] people,
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; railroad tank loads uh of of water every
[1:07:52] day for all of these people. God looking
[1:07:56] over his family. You say, "Well, some of
[1:07:58] them there were Kora and Dayan and
[1:08:01] Abrams and all of these renegades in the
[1:08:03] earth swallowed up, but God's purpose
[1:08:06] could not be could not be derailed.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; I don't care what people say about the
[1:08:15] bride of Jesus Christ. God's purpose
[1:08:18] shall never fail.
[1:08:21] She'll be there.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; And God had said, "I will make for him a
[1:08:27] help meat. I'll make for him a wife."
[1:08:30] That's the saith the Lord. And nothing
[1:08:32] can change that.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; And this body of people. And then God
[1:08:38] speaks to Abraham and says, "Speak to
[1:08:40] the people. Make known my word and
[1:08:43] they'll be a peculiar people unto me.
[1:08:46] They'll be a holy nation unto me. They
[1:08:48] will be a they will be a congregation of
[1:08:52] Israel. Now he calls them on on gen
[1:08:55] Exodus the 12th chapter just coming to
[1:08:57] the blood sacrifice. Now they'll be a
[1:09:00] congregation.
[1:09:02] Speak to the congregation of Israel.
[1:09:05] Congregation being the gathering of the
[1:09:08] people. This will be a gathering. Not
[1:09:10] just a gathering coming from another
[1:09:12] word. That means there'll be a gathering
[1:09:14] that shall be a testimony. There'll be a
[1:09:17] gathering that shall be a witness. They
[1:09:19] are a gathering. And furthermore, it
[1:09:21] goes even further. It goes further from
[1:09:23] another compound word. There'll be a
[1:09:25] gathering for a witness, but for a
[1:09:28] restoration.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; And this restoration, this gathering is
[1:09:32] to make somebody a king and make
[1:09:35] somebody a queen.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Speak to the congregation.
[1:09:40] And I'm speaking to you about the
[1:09:42] congregation. God instituted
[1:09:45] the congregation of Israel.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A lot of congregations that
[1:09:52] are gathering in buildings today, but
[1:09:54] there are some that God has ordained.
[1:09:57] And whether they be in Kuwait or Iran,
[1:10:00] whether they be in India or China,
[1:10:02] whether they be in Europe or in Siberia
[1:10:04] or Russia, wherever they are, God has
[1:10:07] ordained his congregation. And he has
[1:10:10] said, "You're my children and you're my
[1:10:14] family. You will be my witness in the
[1:10:16] earth. You're going to testify that I am
[1:10:19] king and I'm going to confirm that
[1:10:21] you're my queen."
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Not an individualistic
[1:10:32] kind of religion. This is a collective
[1:10:35] body. And God begin
[1:10:38] he be to do this by the power of his own
[1:10:43] spoken word.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Now God cannot
[1:10:49] increase in knowledge.
[1:10:53] Neither can God increase in power.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; But he can increase in the manifestation
[1:11:00] of his power.
[1:11:03] He can increase in the glory of his
[1:11:07] manifestation.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; He can become more glorious. He can ever
[1:11:11] expand. They tell me that the universe
[1:11:13] is an expanding uh uh universe. That it
[1:11:17] is that there are more galaxies and
[1:11:20] more. Well, that doesn't bother me at
[1:11:22] all. I would believe that probably
[1:11:23] that's exactly right because God is he
[1:11:27] you can't put him in a box. Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; You can't you can't define him. And
[1:11:33] that's why he said don't make any image
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; unto me because then that would that
[1:11:38] would that that would define what God
[1:11:40] was. And soon as you define him, he's
[1:11:43] gone beyond it.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; And that is why the prophet said and
[1:11:47] came so hard against denominations
[1:11:50] because a denomination defines what God
[1:11:53] is and what he's not. What truth is and
[1:11:57] and can't go any further. God can only
[1:12:00] be known by revelation. And that and
[1:12:02] this God is an expanding God. He's an
[1:12:05] enlargement. He continues, he increases.
[1:12:09] He's eternal.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; He said Jehovah. Jehovah is which is a
[1:12:16] uh which is two uh words uh describing
[1:12:20] God put together that is a self-existent
[1:12:25] one. But the prophet says now he is a
[1:12:28] self-existent one that exists with his
[1:12:31] family.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; And he said he cannot be self-existent
[1:12:36] anymore.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; He exists with his family.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; He exists with you.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Can you realize how great this is that
[1:12:45] we poor beings but yet creatures of his
[1:12:49] own grace and his own election. We
[1:12:52] creatures have made him so he cannot be
[1:12:55] alone anymore because he's fulfilling
[1:12:59] his own word. It's not good for man to
[1:13:02] be alone. There was something within him
[1:13:05] that desired fellowship. And that is why
[1:13:08] when the when the very expression of the
[1:13:11] invisible God was here on earth, the
[1:13:13] Godhead, the fullness of the Godhead
[1:13:15] bodily, he desired and the prophet said
[1:13:18] he Jesus only asked for one thing and
[1:13:21] that was your fellowship.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Think of it your fellowship.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was expressing the
[1:13:31] father.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; It's not good
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; to be alone.
[1:13:37] And so God,
[1:13:39] he can expand
[1:13:42] in his manifestation of his glory. Let
[1:13:45] there be light. And there was. Let there
[1:13:47] be a firmament in the midst of the
[1:13:49] waters. And there was.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Let the waters under the heaven be
[1:13:53] gathered together in one place. And it
[1:13:55] was so.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Let the earth bring forth grass and
[1:14:00] herb. And it was and it did.
[1:14:04] Let the waters bring forth abundantly
[1:14:06] the moving creatures that hath life. And
[1:14:08] it did.
[1:14:11] Let the earth bring forth the living
[1:14:13] creatures after its kind. And it did.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; And God created man in his own image.
[1:14:21] And he did. He created him.
[1:14:26] And he said, "And I will make
[1:14:30] a woman." And he did.
[1:14:38] He said, "When the spirit of God,
[1:14:41] the logos, the word which God said, let
[1:14:45] there be and there was, and there went
[1:14:47] the logos, which is the word and the
[1:14:50] word." He said, "Cuz all this was in the
[1:14:52] logos." All of this was in the logos.
[1:14:55] Let there be and there was. Let it be
[1:14:57] and it did.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; It was in the logos to begin with. It
[1:15:01] was in the word to begin with. And so
[1:15:03] when the word proceeded out,
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; that which proceeded out had to happen
[1:15:09] because it wasn't the man,
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; we don't even know in what form God
[1:15:15] spoke it, but he said it.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Before there was any earthly form. And
[1:15:21] so when Jesus came the the perfect image
[1:15:25] of the invisible God standing upon earth
[1:15:28] and he said you know rise up take up
[1:15:30] your bed and walk. He did
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; because it was the logos that was coming
[1:15:36] out.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Not just the voice of a man
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; but the logos was speaking. Behold. And
[1:15:42] they were
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; and as the logos be to breathe upon the
[1:15:51] earth, there came forth there came
[1:15:53] marine life building up to bird life
[1:15:57] onto animal life. And finally there was
[1:16:00] something in the represent
[1:16:02] representation or looked like the thing
[1:16:04] that was brooding over it. You see God,
[1:16:08] he's saying God brooded over the earth.
[1:16:11] He brooded. The spirit of God moved. Oh,
[1:16:13] it wasn't 24 hours.
[1:16:17] He brooded and he brooded it. Let there
[1:16:20] be. And there was let the waters and it
[1:16:24] did. Let the earth and it did. It kept
[1:16:27] brooding over the earth. Kept brooding
[1:16:29] until
[1:16:31] came one like him.
[1:16:34] Looked like the one. It was a
[1:16:37] representation of the one that was
[1:16:39] brooding. standing upon the earth and
[1:16:43] then God maybe stepped back and said
[1:16:49] it's very good
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; this is very good
[1:16:56] he was now seeing
[1:16:58] his attributes
[1:17:00] I had certain desires now I see them
[1:17:02] manifested
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; and it's very good after he said it was
[1:17:07] very Good.
[1:17:11] The scripture says,
[1:17:13] "And all
[1:17:15] all the animals, those are something
[1:17:17] that God had in his mind. And all of
[1:17:21] these living creatures begin to pass
[1:17:23] before Adam. And Adam with the very
[1:17:26] intelligence of God gave name to all the
[1:17:29] animals, each male and his female
[1:17:33] passing by." And then the scripture
[1:17:35] says, "But there was none found for
[1:17:38] Adam."
[1:17:40] And God says, "It's not good." Not Adam.
[1:17:44] Adam, he didn't say, "I'm lonely.
[1:17:47] I see all these going by in pairs, but
[1:17:49] there's nothing for me."
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, Adam didn't say that. God said it.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; It's not good for man to be alone. He's
[1:17:58] finished his creation, the original
[1:18:00] creation. That's why the prophet says
[1:18:02] byproduct says I'll make for him for him
[1:18:05] a wife. I'll make a woman
[1:18:09] had nothing to do with her choice and
[1:18:12] nothing to do with Adam's choice.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Had to do with God's choice.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; And God brought the woman to the man.
[1:18:23] this very day that you're seated here in
[1:18:26] this church or those that are on the
[1:18:29] internet seated where they are in the
[1:18:31] world part of the body of Christ there's
[1:18:35] a movement happening there's an action
[1:18:37] taking place we may call it missions we
[1:18:39] may call it something else we may call
[1:18:41] it a Sunday morning service or Wednesday
[1:18:43] service or whatever more but there's an
[1:18:45] action taking place if this thing is of
[1:18:48] God if it's not we should all we should
[1:18:50] dismiss now and go home so we don't
[1:18:53] waste each other's time.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; And I'd be delighted to do that if I
[1:18:58] wasn't convinced it was God.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; But if it is God, then we say, "God,
[1:19:04] what are you doing?" And he'll say, "I'm
[1:19:06] making a woman."
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, it has come to the
[1:19:12] season that it's not the congregation
[1:19:15] anymore. It's not just a nation anymore.
[1:19:18] It's not just a peculiar people anymore.
[1:19:20] And it's not even what Jesus said. He
[1:19:22] said, "I'll build my church." It's
[1:19:24] progressed beyond church because out of
[1:19:27] that church had to come a very specific
[1:19:31] woman.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Call a bride of Jesus Christ, a an
[1:19:37] elected lady.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; That would be word of his word and bone
[1:19:44] of his bone. Hallelujah. Not an
[1:19:46] individual now but a collective body.
[1:19:50] Spirit of his spirit, word of his word,
[1:19:53] life of his life. Hallelujah. Flesh of
[1:19:57] his flesh. This is called the bride of
[1:20:00] Jesus Christ. And so, not in his first
[1:20:02] coming, but in his second, he now comes.
[1:20:05] It wasn't brother Brandham that called
[1:20:07] you bride. It was the son of man called
[1:20:10] you bride. He himself said, "You're not
[1:20:13] be church anymore. There's been
[1:20:16] churches, churches, brides, brides. I
[1:20:18] see the logos coming out of the vessel
[1:20:21] mouth of a prophet vessel calling you
[1:20:25] bride.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; A different kind of a collection now a
[1:20:30] different kind of a group, a different
[1:20:33] kind of a body.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; God the logo.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to bring her to the man.
[1:20:42] Some of us,
[1:20:45] I trust
[1:20:47] all of us,
[1:20:49] we talk about a body change. I'll tell
[1:20:51] you that scripture only exists because
[1:20:54] God intends to bring some by that
[1:20:57] method.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; He intends to change their atoms while
[1:21:01] they're breathing.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; You'll take one breath in time and the
[1:21:05] next one will be in the eternities.
[1:21:09] Hallelujah.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; He intends to take you, but that action
[1:21:13] will be to fulfill that scripture. I'm
[1:21:16] going to bring the woman to the man.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; And you'll come to the man.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Some may come by the way of the grave
[1:21:26] and they have died. They've been
[1:21:28] separated from life, separated from
[1:21:30] their loved ones, and they're buried
[1:21:32] beneath the soil. But God has decreed,
[1:21:36] I'm going to bring the woman to the man.
[1:21:39] And though they may be nothing but ashes
[1:21:42] scattered to the seven seas or buried
[1:21:45] beneath the earth of this of the soil,
[1:21:48] God is going to bring them back in a
[1:21:50] resurrection and show that the last
[1:21:53] enemy to be destroyed. Not just to be
[1:21:56] defeated, to be destroyed is death.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:05] And this man Jesus Christ in his first
[1:22:08] coming realized
[1:22:11] something perhaps we didn't realize but
[1:22:14] he the creator knew we were born in sin
[1:22:18] and shapen in iniquities. We were we had
[1:22:21] a husband. We were already united to
[1:22:25] that husband was our first nature which
[1:22:28] we got through our byproduct birth
[1:22:31] through a natural sexual birth. We came
[1:22:34] into the world born in sin, shapen in
[1:22:37] iniquities with a nature speaking lies
[1:22:40] and living all kinds of a debauchery
[1:22:43] life. But God rich in mercy
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; said they cannot be I they cannot be
[1:22:49] taken and held from me. And so God in
[1:22:52] his great mercy, what he did was he came
[1:22:55] down himself. Hallelujah. And Satan in
[1:22:59] Eden took the head of the woman and
[1:23:01] said, "Did God say and the and the God
[1:23:05] himself didn't take the head of the
[1:23:07] woman, but he took her womb
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; and he created a seed
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; and out of that womb came one called
[1:23:15] Jesus Christ. He was the perfect image
[1:23:17] of the invisible God. And God was in
[1:23:20] him. He was God and man."
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:25] And he took our covenant with death. He
[1:23:28] took our covenant that came through a
[1:23:31] sexual birth. He took our covenant to
[1:23:34] the cross and it could only be destroyed
[1:23:36] by death.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; And so he took our sin and he went to
[1:23:40] the cross and took our covenant with
[1:23:42] death and died himself.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; One individual.
[1:23:48] One individual. God starting the
[1:23:51] redemptive process with one individual.
[1:23:54] He was the first fruits of many. He was
[1:23:57] the first sheath that should be waved
[1:23:59] over the people. And the and the waving
[1:24:02] of the sheath was a testimony by God
[1:24:05] that there were more like him that are
[1:24:08] in the field. You weren't even born yet.
[1:24:11] The body you're sitting in was only
[1:24:13] elements of the earth. You weren't even
[1:24:15] born. Your mother and father hadn't even
[1:24:18] conceived you yet. You weren't even in
[1:24:20] anybody's thoughts. But God knew that
[1:24:23] you're going to come on the scene at a
[1:24:26] certain time. Not when Jesus would walk
[1:24:28] here and call you church, but when Jesus
[1:24:30] would walk here in another body and call
[1:24:33] you bride.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; And now he's going to give evidence to
[1:24:41] this ever expanding power of his, this
[1:24:45] glorious dynamic power, the dynamics of
[1:24:48] the Holy Spirit. He said, "I'm going to
[1:24:51] destroy death.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show that he's destroyed."
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; He was destroyed at Calvary and the and
[1:24:59] our Lord Jesus raised with the keys of
[1:25:02] death, hell, and the grave. But now that
[1:25:04] was a single individual,
[1:25:07] but now it's going to be a collective
[1:25:09] body. They're going to rise. They're
[1:25:12] going to rise. Hallelujah. In the
[1:25:14] resurrection morning, there'll be a
[1:25:17] resurrection. My brother, why can we say
[1:25:19] that? Because it is spoken and it shall
[1:25:23] be.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Let there be. And there was.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Let it bring forth. And it did.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; And he says through the Apostle Paul,
[1:25:36] "We shall not all sleep, but we shall
[1:25:39] all rise. We'll not all sleep, but we'll
[1:25:42] be quickened in a moment, in the
[1:25:45] twinkling of an eye. Hallelujah.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; One of these days, more certain than I'm
[1:25:50] standing here, more certain than you're
[1:25:52] sitting there, there will come those
[1:25:54] raised from the dead.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They must be because the
[1:25:58] word has already said it. The logos has
[1:26:01] spoken.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; And there cannot be any other way. And
[1:26:07] they'll begin to mingle with those that
[1:26:09] are alive. There'll be a sweep.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know what you feel this
[1:26:13] morning, but there will be a sweep.
[1:26:17] Oh God, let that sweep, let me be a
[1:26:19] recipient of that sweep, a sweep over
[1:26:22] our bodies and a changed in our atoms
[1:26:26] and will defeat death while we walk here
[1:26:29] on earth.
[1:26:32] Oh, let me be a part of that. Don't you
[1:26:35] want to be a part of that? You think I'm
[1:26:37] just excited? That's the truth of God's
[1:26:39] word.
[1:26:41] Hallelujah.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Don't miss that one. There'll be a
[1:26:47] sweep. The Logos has already spoken it.
[1:26:51] And it will be exactly as he said it.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; He said there will be a bride.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; He saw it already. There will be a
[1:27:00] bride. And the very word coming out of
[1:27:02] his mouth was creating that bride
[1:27:05] [Music]
[1:27:07] for himself.
[1:27:09] He said his own word created her.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; You're not here by an accident. If
[1:27:16] you're here because this church got a
[1:27:18] program, goodbye.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; If you're here because of just some
[1:27:21] little fellowship, goodbye. This
[1:27:24] gathering of people is for one purpose,
[1:27:28] the collective body of Jesus Christ.
[1:27:33] Not what I think, not what you think,
[1:27:35] not what I like, not what you like, not
[1:27:38] what we dislike. This is the body of
[1:27:40] Christ.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Has been created by the word. And what
[1:27:44] we're seeing happening today is God
[1:27:46] himself bringing the woman to the man.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; That will be the final act. The final
[1:27:53] act you'll pass from this realm, from
[1:27:55] this dimension. Oh God, let it be. We'll
[1:27:59] pass from this dimension into another
[1:28:02] one into the arms of our lover.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; You think Adam loved Eve? Wait till you
[1:28:12] see this.
[1:28:14] There be nothing like that. There's
[1:28:16] never been a union like this one. We're
[1:28:18] already united. But this veil of this
[1:28:21] flesh must drop so that we can seize the
[1:28:24] everlasting prize
[1:28:27] ever. That's why this isn't just
[1:28:30] religion. That's why this church isn't
[1:28:32] like other churches. That's why this
[1:28:34] message is not like other denominations.
[1:28:37] They aren't even the same. They're not
[1:28:38] in the same planet.
[1:28:45] [Applause]
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; When the man came,
[1:28:51] it was a very simple life.
[1:28:54] They rode on the donkeys and the animals
[1:28:57] and the burden bearers.
[1:29:00] Life was rural.
[1:29:02] Life was simple
[1:29:05] when the man came.
[1:29:08] But when the woman came,
[1:29:10] it was very complex.
[1:29:13] Women are from Venus.
[1:29:18] Men are from Mars, they say. I don't
[1:29:20] know what the difference is, but
[1:29:23] who can understand a woman? I thank God
[1:29:27] I know God.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Can thou understand this creature? Thou
[1:29:37] knowest.
[1:29:44] You that aren't married don't know what
[1:29:45] I'm talking about.
[1:29:48] I'm going on 51 years and I'm been in 51
[1:29:51] years of training.
[1:29:53] I've learned a lot of things. But don't
[1:29:55] anybody come to me and ask me what I
[1:29:57] learned cuz I'm not too sure what I
[1:30:00] learned.
[1:30:02] But the woman come in a very complex and
[1:30:05] a prophet came and in case you didn't
[1:30:08] know, he had to remind us this is a
[1:30:10] complex age.
[1:30:14] This is an age Jesus never indicated
[1:30:17] that the deception would be so powerful
[1:30:20] when he was here as the man that only
[1:30:25] scarcely would the righteous be saved.
[1:30:28] and all. But when the woman come
[1:30:32] in and the age of the woman, the
[1:30:34] deception would be so powerful.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; The desires would be so strong.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; The enemy, Satan himself, will have
[1:30:45] taken the seals so to speak off of
[1:30:47] himself. He would have come out in the
[1:30:49] open and enchanted the people with every
[1:30:52] delight with tantaliz
[1:30:56] every feeling, every sense be a taste or
[1:30:59] smell with all the perfumes and all the
[1:31:01] beautiful things and all the fragrances
[1:31:03] and all the foods and all the drinks and
[1:31:07] this and that and this is new and
[1:31:09] flashing it before the people knew this,
[1:31:11] knew that, try this, try that and the
[1:31:13] people get on this meal and go a new
[1:31:16] religion, a new sound, a new music, a
[1:31:18] new this, everything's new. Oh my
[1:31:20] brother, my sister, that's the age, the
[1:31:22] complex age of the woman. But in the
[1:31:26] midst of that complex age, in the midst
[1:31:29] of that deception, in the midst of that
[1:31:31] perversion, rises out of the earth a
[1:31:34] beautiful, pure virgin wife
[1:31:40] for the man.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; I will make for him
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; a help meat.
[1:31:49] and he brought the woman to the man.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; He took centuries
[1:31:56] raising the man out of the earth. When
[1:31:59] God called Abraham, that's what he had
[1:32:00] in his mind was Christ.
[1:32:04] Wasn't just Abraham. It was Christ.
[1:32:07] When he called when he called him,
[1:32:11] I'm going to give you a seed. Isaac come
[1:32:14] the other
[1:32:16] Jacob
[1:32:18] Joseph.
[1:32:20] God in his mind saw Christ.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; And he's raising him where? Out of the
[1:32:26] earth.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; He formed the first Adam out of the
[1:32:30] earth. I know. He didn't just go cl
[1:32:33] There you are. He brought him out out of
[1:32:36] the earth. Now he's bringing the second
[1:32:38] atom out of the earth.
[1:32:40] Oh,
[1:32:41] out of this terrible, tumultuous time,
[1:32:44] out of bondage, they went into bondage.
[1:32:48] But that line of faith continued on.
[1:32:52] God's purpose could never be destroyed.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of invention
[1:32:59] comes. I don't care whether it be
[1:33:01] computer or the internet or all of this
[1:33:03] or whatever more. I don't care about
[1:33:05] their pornography or all of this
[1:33:08] business. I can tell you one thing. The
[1:33:10] work and purpose of God can never be
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; it can never be uh derailed.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; It can never be thwarted.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; It can never be circumvented.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, my sister, I just feel
[1:33:29] eaten up. I feel consumed
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; with this with this. It's not good for
[1:33:39] him to be alone.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says when Jesus was here
[1:33:49] says of him, "And all men,
[1:33:54] all men." Brother Brandham called it his
[1:33:56] church. I'm trying to make as much
[1:33:59] headway as I can. He called it his
[1:34:02] church, his 12 disciples.
[1:34:05] And they left him and fled.
[1:34:08] He came to his own, and his own received
[1:34:11] him not.
[1:34:13] But as many as received him, to them
[1:34:15] gave he power to become the sons of God,
[1:34:17] but he came to his own.
[1:34:20] He's a a man rejected
[1:34:24] of men
[1:34:26] and acquainted with grief.
[1:34:31] This was a part of this whole program.
[1:34:35] He was alone.
[1:34:40] But the same word abides. It's not good
[1:34:44] for him to be alone.
[1:34:47] There must be someone because the
[1:34:50] attribute of God called for fellowship.
[1:34:54] Amen.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; You think that God would hunger and
[1:34:56] thirst for fellowship, desire and yearn
[1:34:59] for fellowship, and allow some fallen
[1:35:02] archangel called Lucifer to to prevent
[1:35:05] that, not in a trillion years,
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; couldn't stop it. But even though he and
[1:35:14] you'll find wherever the word came,
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word then comes into and
[1:35:20] begins to issue out from Apostle Paul.
[1:35:23] And Apostle Paul, he says, "All men have
[1:35:27] forsaken me.
[1:35:31] You want to go and listen to present
[1:35:33] stage of my ministry." Now in this day,
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says all the doors are
[1:35:39] closed.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; And he goes right to the same scripture
[1:35:43] and he says, "Deus hath forsaken me.
[1:35:49] He said, "Deus didn't go off into sin,
[1:35:51] but he just forsook him."
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; And he described
[1:35:56] there was a man that was with brother
[1:35:58] Brandham, a very, very wealthy man, and
[1:36:02] his first name was Damos.
[1:36:06] I do not want to call his name in
[1:36:08] public, but he was the founder of the
[1:36:10] Full Gospel Businessman's Voice. and on
[1:36:14] down the road. And brother Brandham
[1:36:15] describes before it even happened, he
[1:36:17] says he went off and he chose the big
[1:36:20] things,
[1:36:21] chose the wealth and chose those things.
[1:36:24] And I saw where that man sits on the
[1:36:27] platform with a Catholic bishop
[1:36:31] suggesting that or Roberts
[1:36:34] and and another great Christian leader
[1:36:39] should go to the Vatican and be received
[1:36:41] by the Pope. He said, ' And I'm going to
[1:36:44] put that forward. I think that they
[1:36:46] should do that
[1:36:49] way earlier.
[1:36:51] Here's the son of man
[1:36:55] in the vessel of of a prophet.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham being a vessel
[1:37:00] portraying giving
[1:37:03] allowing
[1:37:06] the son of man to be revealed.
[1:37:11] He's saying, "All men have forsaken me.
[1:37:14] Death hath for Deeus hath forsaken me."
[1:37:17] And he quotes from Paul where Paul
[1:37:20] says, "Uh, when you come, bring my cloak
[1:37:26] and bring the scrolls. Above all, bring
[1:37:28] the scrolls."
[1:37:30] And Paul was reduced. Think of it,
[1:37:33] friends. Here I am.
[1:37:38] You know what? Am I
[1:37:42] below zero?
[1:37:45] And if I said, "Would you please bring
[1:37:47] my coat?" There'd probably be 500 of you
[1:37:49] that bring a coat.
[1:37:51] Here's Apostle Paul, the very mouthpiece
[1:37:55] of God,
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; the very
[1:38:00] initiator of the New Testament doctrine.
[1:38:04] one who would write most of this
[1:38:06] marvelous book
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; of the New Testament
[1:38:12] saying when you come say this one has
[1:38:15] left me and Deus hath forsaken me and
[1:38:17] all men he said have forsaken me
[1:38:21] and and he had one he said I've sent
[1:38:23] this one to Ephesus and but when you
[1:38:26] come bring the books and bring the
[1:38:29] parchments especially and bring my coat
[1:38:35] Why was he Why was he forsaken?
[1:38:38] Because Because of the man.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Because of the man. Are you with me?
[1:38:44] Because of Christ. Because of the word.
[1:38:49] You can live your life down here and be
[1:38:51] as popular as you want or as popular as
[1:38:54] the world will allow you. But as you
[1:38:57] begin to express
[1:38:59] Christ
[1:39:01] and you will hear some things perhaps
[1:39:04] tonight from brother Mustafa
[1:39:07] and in those countries and from brother
[1:39:09] Tony who just mentioned if those men let
[1:39:14] it out if they discover that they're
[1:39:16] Christians it could either mean a bullet
[1:39:18] to the head or at the very least you
[1:39:21] lose your work. You lose your you lose
[1:39:23] your income. You're done. You're
[1:39:25] finished. I can tell you why. It's
[1:39:29] because of the man,
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Christ. You understand? But when he's
[1:39:34] when he expresses himself, when he makes
[1:39:36] himself known, people see it right away.
[1:39:40] They know it right away. And so in this
[1:39:44] day and age, in this day,
[1:39:48] Brother Brandham had to say, and he did
[1:39:50] say it. He said, "It's not me that they
[1:39:55] hate. It's the message."
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; He was a nice man. They love to have
[1:40:02] him. And he goes right back and says,
[1:40:05] "Oh, that young prophet Jesus of
[1:40:08] Nazareth. Oh, they wanted him. They
[1:40:11] wanted his sign. They wanted his
[1:40:12] miracles. They wanted that. They want
[1:40:15] the blessings."
[1:40:17] That's where the church got into
[1:40:18] trouble.
[1:40:20] Brother Brandham said, "You see the
[1:40:22] woman on the street and then you see the
[1:40:24] spiritual church of the church is a
[1:40:26] woman." What's a woman on the street do?
[1:40:29] She bears herself the very graces that
[1:40:32] God has given her body to bring forth
[1:40:36] life, but exposes it to the world so
[1:40:40] that men can lust and commit adultery
[1:40:43] with them, making themselves
[1:40:45] prostitutes.
[1:40:47] That's strong. But that's the word that
[1:40:49] he used.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; And a prophet said if she dresses that
[1:40:54] way, now that is only in indicative of
[1:40:57] the spiritual condition for the church.
[1:41:00] The church exposed herself. Said you
[1:41:03] don't you want joy? Don't you want to be
[1:41:05] happy? Don't you want to be healed?
[1:41:07] Don't you want to have this? Don't you
[1:41:09] want to, you know, all all of these
[1:41:11] blessings, all of these graces that God
[1:41:13] gave the church and exposed it to the
[1:41:16] world,
[1:41:17] no new birth, no repentance.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; I believe in repentance.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; I believe that it's the goodness of God
[1:41:27] that brings a man to repentance
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; and that rep that that godly sorrow
[1:41:33] workketh repentance. And I tell you
[1:41:35] what, my brother, my sister, I still
[1:41:37] believe in the old fashioned need to be
[1:41:39] sorry for our sin.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Sorry that we rejected God. Sorry we
[1:41:44] walked away from him and come with a
[1:41:47] humility and repentance. And then then
[1:41:50] comes forgiveness.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; And so it was in this day that he had to
[1:41:58] be rejected. The message had to be
[1:42:00] rejected. And we have a rejected
[1:42:02] message. So, we're not trying to make it
[1:42:04] popular. We're not trying to, you know,
[1:42:07] expose the graces of the message. I
[1:42:09] believe it still has to come the same
[1:42:11] old-fashioned way.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; People have to come by repentance.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; And then God honors that.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:30] Give me another few minutes.
[1:42:39] in the message Jehovah Gyra.
[1:42:43] He said, "If you could just realize
[1:42:46] that the very one that you serve and
[1:42:50] separated yourself from the world to
[1:42:52] serve, the very one that you love, the
[1:42:55] very one that's going to stand in
[1:42:57] judgment, you in judgment with him to be
[1:42:59] judged if his presence can come right
[1:43:02] here and show that he's here." He says
[1:43:05] now and he said the only difference he
[1:43:08] said now his corporal body can't do it.
[1:43:14] There was I'm trying to acquaint you
[1:43:16] with the full scope of this ministry.
[1:43:19] The corporal body can't do it. There was
[1:43:23] nothing different, nothing different
[1:43:27] between Christ standing here 2,000 years
[1:43:31] ago in a corporal body and he's telling
[1:43:35] them everything is exactly the same. The
[1:43:40] only thing he can't do what he wants to
[1:43:43] do now and the only difference is the
[1:43:46] corporal body. Now he's in the corporate
[1:43:49] body. He's in the body of Jesus Christ,
[1:43:53] but it is the same identical Christ. Oh,
[1:43:57] if we could have that understanding,
[1:43:59] that revelation this morning, personal
[1:44:01] revelation to you, it's the same Christ.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; I don't care how old you are, how young
[1:44:05] you are, or what your station in life.
[1:44:07] It is the same Christ.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; But it's just not the corporal body.
[1:44:13] It's the corporate body.
[1:44:16] Amen.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; And that's what that's what God is
[1:44:19] dealing with right now. And there are
[1:44:21] some things just as I draw to a close.
[1:44:25] There are some things friends
[1:44:28] that cannot happen
[1:44:31] in the individual on an individual basis
[1:44:34] quite the same. And that is why the
[1:44:37] scripture says if two or three
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; shall agree
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; it shall be done.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:45] Don't question God and don't don't ask
[1:44:48] why that is. We can ask but we won't get
[1:44:50] the answer. But the one thing I I've
[1:44:53] taken you right from Genesis all the way
[1:44:55] through the scripture. One thing is
[1:44:58] absolutely certain. When God had his
[1:45:02] purpose and his program in mind and you
[1:45:05] are a part of that program, if you
[1:45:07] believe you're part of that program, I
[1:45:09] am stating emphatically and irrevocably
[1:45:14] that what God had in his mind was a
[1:45:17] corporate, a body,
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; the body of Christ.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:25] And that in his final act, think of it,
[1:45:29] his final act.
[1:45:32] Oh my.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; He brought the woman to the man and in
[1:45:38] that first instance, the fall came.
[1:45:43] They fell.
[1:45:45] She was deceived. And her husband went
[1:45:48] in to redeem her. And the fall came and
[1:45:50] God immediately begin to build another
[1:45:54] masterpiece
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; and brought forth a second Adam. And now
[1:45:59] there's a wife for that Adam. And in the
[1:46:02] conclusion of the ages in the end time
[1:46:05] and here we are. His final act is to
[1:46:10] bring her to him to to show the ultimate
[1:46:14] defeat of what happened back there. And
[1:46:17] to think that you and I could sit here
[1:46:19] this morning and be a part of that
[1:46:21] program,
[1:46:23] it's so moving to me to think that he
[1:46:25] would call us nobodies.
[1:46:27] Call us insignificant creatures of the
[1:46:30] earth. And that he would allow us, as he
[1:46:33] said, an invisible union creeping on the
[1:46:36] brittle threads. We little humans
[1:46:39] creeping on the brittle threads of life
[1:46:41] in our very lif being expended from us.
[1:46:45] and you're getting older and you're
[1:46:47] going to get weaker and death already
[1:46:48] rest on us. But with this great sentence
[1:46:51] that God has given, there'll be a bride
[1:46:54] and she'll be a spotless bride. There'll
[1:46:57] be a resurrection. There'll be a supper
[1:46:59] table. There'll be these things. The
[1:47:01] very logos that spoke in the beginning,
[1:47:04] let there be, is the same one that has
[1:47:06] said this.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; And if you just say, well, that was a
[1:47:10] man. He's a nice lowly Nazarene from
[1:47:12] Nazareth. His father's here, Joseph. And
[1:47:15] that's the way people treat brother
[1:47:16] Brandon's ministry. It's not that.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; You miss that completely. It's not that
[1:47:21] at all. It's so far beyond that. But
[1:47:23] when you get the revelation that that
[1:47:26] was a very logos,
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; If God wanted to say out of his mouth,
[1:47:32] let there be a let there be a light in
[1:47:34] the firmament.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; It's the same one that spoke it. Amen.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says of Jesus Christ
[1:47:42] because he was creator when he hung on
[1:47:44] the cross. He says everything had to
[1:47:46] testify that he was forsaken. Even the
[1:47:49] sun and the moon which he created
[1:47:52] stopped shining turning their back on
[1:47:54] him. His creation left him. He said his
[1:47:57] creation forsook him. His father forsook
[1:48:01] him. His church forsook him. He was
[1:48:04] alone. But there was a word, he shall
[1:48:06] not be alone.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; For it's not good that man shall be
[1:48:11] alone.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; I will make for him a wife.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; I don't know what you think about him,
[1:48:17] but to me there's no there there isn't
[1:48:19] anything that could be too good for him.
[1:48:21] And to think somehow to grasp somehow
[1:48:24] I'm a part of that unit called the body,
[1:48:28] the bride, the wife of the lamb, the
[1:48:31] bride of Jesus Christ. It's things are
[1:48:33] too wonderful for us.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Nobody knows you perhaps better than
[1:48:41] yourself outside of God himself. And you
[1:48:44] know all your frailties and you know all
[1:48:45] your weaknesses and you know everything
[1:48:47] about you know your failures and to
[1:48:50] think
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; I'm part of what he took
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; to make
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; I'll make
[1:48:57] a wife for him. I'll make a woman for
[1:49:01] him. In the mind of God, in the mind of
[1:49:04] God, somehow I say, couldn't you choose
[1:49:07] something better?
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Couldn't you choose someone with more
[1:49:11] integrity?
[1:49:12] Couldn't you choose a more sincere
[1:49:14] people? But it had nothing to do with
[1:49:17] that. It has to do with election.
[1:49:20] How glorious election is. I have chosen
[1:49:23] them. And nobody can question why he
[1:49:26] chose you, why he chose me. He has
[1:49:29] chosen us.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; And I will make for him a wife, a woman.
[1:49:35] It's not good that this man, the son of
[1:49:37] man, should be alone. I'll make for him
[1:49:39] a wife.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; And here in the end time, here you sit
[1:49:45] in the end time with this great,
[1:49:48] splendid, glorious honor.
[1:49:53] Sitting here beside your friends, your
[1:49:54] husband, your wife, your children, or
[1:49:55] whatever more. I want you to go out of
[1:49:58] this place saying, "I'm part of what God
[1:50:01] has picked up out of the earth and began
[1:50:04] to form not a man now, but a woman."
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; It wasn't, "Oh, through the holy union
[1:50:13] of marriage. My mother and father came
[1:50:15] together and gave me life. I was birthed
[1:50:19] into this world. I'm a Norwegian. I'm a
[1:50:21] German. I'm I'm a Brit. I'm this. I'm
[1:50:23] that. I'm Russian. I'm Ukrainian. I'm
[1:50:26] Canadian. and I'm American. That's a
[1:50:28] bunch of nonsense. It was God taking a
[1:50:31] piece of the earth.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; And so I'm going to make a woman
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; and a woman's going to be suited
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; to my son
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; exactly
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; to his taste.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; That's what this is all about. And there
[1:50:50] is nothing, nothing that can ever change
[1:50:54] that word of God that's been spoken. It
[1:50:58] has been spoken and thus it shall be.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Praise his name.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:10] Glory.
[1:51:13] Thy word, oh God.
[1:51:16] That is his word.
[1:51:20] That's what he said.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I had an Elijah prophet in this
[1:51:28] day said, "Don't worry.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; She'll be there.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; She'll be there. Not here. There."
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; What do you think about that? What do
[1:51:39] you think about that?
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; If he said you'll be here in 2004, that
[1:51:45] wouldn't bring any joy to my heart. But
[1:51:47] when he said, "Don't worry, you'll be
[1:51:50] there. You'll be there." I say, "Oh,
[1:51:52] God, that's what I will hang on to.
[1:51:55] That's where my faith will be anchored.
[1:51:57] You'll be there." What do you think
[1:51:59] about a church? What do you think about
[1:52:01] a Cloverdale Bible way? What do you
[1:52:03] think about it? Those on the internet,
[1:52:04] what do you think about it and say, "Oh,
[1:52:06] I will accept that Logos voice. Don't
[1:52:09] worry, you'll be there."
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:16] Hallelujah.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Oh God, how we thank you.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Your word is for eternally settled in
[1:52:27] heaven.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; What kind of joy does that bring you?
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; What kind of peace? What kind of
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; satisfaction does that bring you?
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This isn't some ball game.
[1:52:47] This isn't the Super Bowl.
[1:52:50] This isn't some NBA game or brawl. This
[1:52:53] isn't something else, friends of this
[1:52:55] world. This isn't a bunch of excitement
[1:52:58] that's been whipped up by some music or
[1:53:01] some band. But this is something that
[1:53:04] whatever you feel, you feel as a result
[1:53:06] of the word of God. Oh, may it reach
[1:53:10] deep down into your soul. may have set
[1:53:13] you on a plane that you have never
[1:53:14] visited before and may we dwell there.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to the almighty God.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; In the resurrection morning, I think we
[1:53:31] have to sing it.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; We have to sing it in the face of every
[1:53:35] demon.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Hell has been emptied out onto the
[1:53:41] earth. Do you deny that? Not a bit. Hell
[1:53:45] is on the earth.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Hell is in our government.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Hell is in our school system.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Hell, all this debauchery and filth.
[1:53:55] It's because hell is loosed. My brother,
[1:53:57] my sister, you want to be thankful for
[1:54:00] you and your family. You have the blood
[1:54:02] of Jesus Christ hang standing over you
[1:54:05] and the token inside
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; crying out, "It's finished. It's
[1:54:09] finished. The price is paid." That's
[1:54:11] what the token says.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Do you have the token in you?
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; And whether we go by the way of the
[1:54:20] grave or whether we go by the way of the
[1:54:23] change, remember that what I'm saying to
[1:54:25] you today, that is the act that will
[1:54:29] perhaps be like the final act that God
[1:54:32] has bringing you
[1:54:36] to the man.
[1:54:43] You might say, "Well, Brother Brandham
[1:54:44] said, I'm going to change it a we bit."
[1:54:50] When God brought that, Brother Brham
[1:54:53] said, "Most beautiful woman that ever
[1:54:55] lived,
[1:54:56] brought her to Adam."
[1:55:01] He looked on her
[1:55:03] and he said, "This now is bone of my
[1:55:09] This is flesh of my flesh.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; She shall be called woman.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; She for she was taken out of the man.
[1:55:18] When Jesus
[1:55:21] now
[1:55:22] in a bodily form sees us, he'll look on
[1:55:27] it and say, "This is the most beautiful
[1:55:28] thing
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; that was ever produced off the face of
[1:55:32] the earth."
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:35] He'll look on it and say, "This is bone
[1:55:38] of my bone.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; This is flesh of my flesh. This is the
[1:55:42] same spirit that was never divided from
[1:55:44] God Almighty. This is the same spirit.
[1:55:49] [Music]
[1:55:56] does today or it did when Jesus said it
[1:55:59] to the disciples. You and I are one.
[1:56:02] You'll be in me. I and the father, the
[1:56:04] father and me. We're one.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; We've heard it oh so many times. We are
[1:56:09] one. But when you have him, brother
[1:56:12] Brandham says, "We're going to sit
[1:56:13] across the table." And I think we ought
[1:56:15] to think about that. We're going to sit
[1:56:17] across the table from one another.
[1:56:21] The redeemed
[1:56:23] of the bride ages, the bride from all
[1:56:26] the ages.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; You'll be sitting at the wedding supper.
[1:56:32] We're going to look at one another.
[1:56:35] He said, "Tears of joy will start going
[1:56:38] down your face." I guess they will.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Tears of joy.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; And he's going to come out. He said he'd
[1:56:44] come out.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Going to walk right down the table. Say,
[1:56:49] "Don't cry anymore, children. It's all
[1:56:51] over."
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, friends,
[1:56:57] it's all over.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; I want to hear those words. The voice
[1:57:03] I've heard before, I want to hear it
[1:57:05] once more saying, "It's all over. Don't
[1:57:09] cry anymore.
[1:57:11] No more separations. No more sickness.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; No more temptation. No more death.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; None of these things.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; No misunderstandings.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; None of these things to crowd in and try
[1:57:25] and take away.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; No more devil.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; No more demons.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Think of it. No more demons. No more
[1:57:34] evil.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Not even a remote thought that could be
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Everything pure,
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; holy. Amen.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Rod, I think maybe you and
[1:57:48] Jeremy and Joanna could sing
[1:57:54] that song that they sung,
[1:57:57] a pure heart.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Let my heart be bowed and my knees bend.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:07] But first, I'm going to sing a bit of
[1:58:09] the inner in a resurrection morning.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:14] [Music]
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; I want to be there.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; I believe we'll be there
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; by his grace. All right, we'll sing a
[1:58:22] verse or two in the resurrection
[1:58:26] morning.
[1:58:28] [Applause]
[1:58:36] sing

[1:59:45] [Music]
[1:59:51] know some of us some of us have a lot
[1:59:53] more to look forward to perhaps than
[1:59:56] some of you that are younger.
[1:59:59] I was in a meeting as a young man, our
[2:00:01] brother Breta Langard, who's
[2:00:04] standing here today. He's in his 80s,
[2:00:07] but I remember when his father, I
[2:00:09] remember it so well, stood up in a
[2:00:12] little log church where we were meeting
[2:00:15] and he gave a testimony. He wanted to
[2:00:17] give a testimony
[2:00:19] and he began to speak of his life. And
[2:00:23] brother Brett will probably remember
[2:00:24] every word, but I remember him just
[2:00:27] looking off like this. And he said, you
[2:00:30] know, it's uh it's fall time
[2:00:33] and uh leaves and everything is changing
[2:00:36] its color.
[2:00:38] It's fall time. And then he described
[2:00:41] his own life. He says, "That's where
[2:00:42] I've come. I've come to my fall time."
[2:00:45] How many days was it, Brother Brea,
[2:00:47] before he was gone?
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; About a month. about 30 days after that,
[2:00:55] just a very short time, and he was
[2:00:57] working, strong man, never been sick,
[2:01:00] and just went into the presence of God.
[2:01:05] What a what a life he lived. How that
[2:01:08] impacted me.
[2:01:11] I won't know him except someone may
[2:01:13] introduce him because I only knew him as
[2:01:14] a elderly man. I have a father and a
[2:01:18] mother
[2:01:19] over there.
[2:01:22] My wife is a father and a mother.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; We got loved ones.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; And the longer I live, I realize I have
[2:01:30] more on the other side than I have on
[2:01:32] this side.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; And that's the way it is as believers.
[2:01:37] Just more is placed on the other side.
[2:01:41] Nothing, nothing in this world, fame,
[2:01:45] fortune, nothing in this world even
[2:01:49] begins to compare. Don't miss that,
[2:01:51] friend. My brother, my sister, this
[2:01:54] morning if you haven't made your calling
[2:01:55] and election, sure. You make sure this
[2:01:58] morning, don't go out of a service like
[2:02:00] this. But just say, "Oh Lord Jesus, give
[2:02:02] me that assurance.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; And if anything stands in the way, let
[2:02:06] it be moved out now
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ." So, what
[2:02:11] must I do? Believe.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Believe and thou shalt be saved.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel like rejoicing.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; What are we doing? We're singing a song,
[2:02:24] aren't we?
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; All right, let's sing another verse just
[2:02:29] before Rod and him sing.
[2:02:32] In the resurrection morning
[2:02:37] to me
[2:02:39] [Applause]
[2:02:44] I see my blessing
[2:02:48] died for me.
[2:02:50] [Applause]
[2:02:52] [Music]
[2:02:53] [Applause]
[2:02:57] Hallelujah.
[2:02:58] [Music]
[2:03:00] Amen.
[2:03:02] My hallelujah
[2:03:04] is the resurrection
[2:03:06] [Music]
[2:03:09] open. We shall rise.
[2:03:12] We shall rise.
[2:03:15] We shall rise.
[2:03:18] We shall rise.
[2:03:21] We shall rise.
[2:03:24] In the resurrection morning,
[2:03:30] [Music]
[2:03:34] [Applause]
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; We rejoice and now we worship. I love
[2:03:41] that song, Brother.

[2:07:34] [Music]
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Let us be that generation, Lord.
[2:07:38] a chosen race,
[2:07:41] this royal priesthood,
[2:07:43] [Music]
[2:07:44] this bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:07:48] Father, I can say today, Lord, I've been
[2:07:49] lifted high
[2:07:51] into the presence of God and into
[2:07:54] heavenly places by the word of God.
[2:07:57] I believe the word of God, Lord, has
[2:08:00] blessed your people.
[2:08:02] And father God, that our eyes have been
[2:08:05] open to this glorious revelation that I
[2:08:08] am this woman.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; And Lord, the hands of God are ushering
[2:08:13] me in the very presence of the king. I
[2:08:16] say, "Oh, this is grace.
[2:08:18] This is the grace of God that I would
[2:08:20] find myself in the mind of God being
[2:08:22] ushered into the presence of God.
[2:08:26] [Music]
[2:08:29] It's a blessed time.
[2:08:32] And father, I just pray this morning if
[2:08:34] there's somebody that's feeling the
[2:08:36] ushering hands of God within their
[2:08:38] lives, let them respond and say, "Oh,
[2:08:40] this is the grace of God that I'm bring
[2:08:43] back to my Adam again." Or let them just
[2:08:46] surrender and let them realize this this
[2:08:49] is the election of God. This is the
[2:08:51] predestinated plan. This is your
[2:08:53] fornowledge taking place. Would you just
[2:08:55] Lord revelate each and every one of us
[2:08:59] to this glorious unfolding that we have
[2:09:02] so enjoyed this morning. I pray God that
[2:09:05] you will bless the man of God.
[2:09:08] Lord, you see the energy. You see the
[2:09:11] burden of the word that's being
[2:09:14] packed within that vessel. I pray God
[2:09:16] that as he poured out, you'd pour back.
[2:09:18] I pray God you'll strengthen him
[2:09:20] mightily this morning. And Lord God, let
[2:09:22] us not forget what we heard. But may
[2:09:24] these be just wonderful, wonderful words
[2:09:26] of life that we cherish these thoughts
[2:09:29] and take them with us and let us commune
[2:09:31] around maybe the supper table even yet
[2:09:34] this evening and commune around this
[2:09:37] glorious message that we heard this
[2:09:40] morning. And Father, we're just
[2:09:42] anticipating another move of God this
[2:09:44] evening. We're just wanting more of your
[2:09:46] grace, more of your presence, more of
[2:09:48] your word. Lord, bless our dear brother
[2:09:51] McGary as he will deliver the word of
[2:09:52] God. and our our dear brother Mustafa
[2:09:55] Lord as he will come and and expound his
[2:09:57] burden. I just pray Lord there'll be a
[2:09:59] blessed time for your people. May we
[2:10:01] come with great expectation and may we
[2:10:03] go now under the blessing and presence
[2:10:05] of God. Go with your children. We pray
[2:10:07] in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:27] Just a little more to dad's testimony.
[2:10:30] We had a special meetings in Dawson
[2:10:32] Creek and and my father testified and he
[2:10:36] said this. 48 years ago I was the
[2:10:40] happiest boy in Norway. I got saved.
[2:10:44] tonight. He said, 48 years later, I'm
[2:10:46] the happiest man in Canada, I'm still
[2:10:49] saved. Less than 24 hours after those
[2:10:53] words, my father went to be with the
[2:10:55] Lord. And uh I've preached, you know,
[2:10:59] for quite a few years, and I often
[2:11:02] mention this, if you want to be the
[2:11:04] happiest
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; anywhere,
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; get saved.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; That's that's the way to do it. God
[2:11:11] bless you.
[2:11:23] Wonder Brother Tony if you could bring
[2:11:25] Brother Mustafa back to the study. I'd
[2:11:26] like to just save a moment. You're all
[2:11:28] dismissed in Jesus name. Isn't it good?
[2:11:31] Isn't it lovely? We see you at 4:30.
[2:11:34] Have a little refreshment, a little rest
[2:11:37] and be here at 4:30. God bless you.
