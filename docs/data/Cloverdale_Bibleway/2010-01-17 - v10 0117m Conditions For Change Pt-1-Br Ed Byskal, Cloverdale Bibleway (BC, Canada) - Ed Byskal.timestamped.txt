[7:07] the tempest
[7:09] power is broken.
[7:14] When Jesus
[7:17] comes,
[7:19] the tears are wiped away.

[7:31] and fills the heart with glory.
[7:38] For all is changed
[7:42] when Jesus comes to save.
[7:49] When Jesus
[7:51] comes,
[7:54] the tempered
[7:56] power is broken.

[8:12] He takes the blue
[8:16] and fills the heart with glory.
[8:23] For all is change
[8:28] when Jesus comes to stay.
[8:33] [Music]
[8:35] Amen. Do you believe that this morning?
[8:37] &gt;&gt; Is that what we need this morning? for
[8:39] Jesus to come. Walk up and down every
[8:41] aisle. We have prayer requests here this
[8:44] morning. We have things on our heart.
[8:46] And when Jesus comes, the temptor's
[8:48] power is broken.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter if it's sin. It
[8:51] doesn't matter if it's sickness. When
[8:53] Jesus comes, it's all finished.
[8:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I'm going to ask brother
[8:58] Luis to come and open the service in a
[8:59] word of prayer. I have a number of

[28:13] Far dear than all that the world could
[28:19] impart
[28:21] was the message that came to my heart.
[28:29] How that Jesus alone
[28:33] for my sin did atone
[28:37] and Calary
[28:39] covers
[28:41] it all.
[28:45] The stripes that he bore and the thorns
[28:50] that he wore told of mercy and love
[28:57] ever more.
[29:00] And my heart bowed in shame
[29:04] as I called on his name.
[29:09] And Calary
[29:11] covers
[29:12] it all.
[29:17] Calary
[29:19] covers
[29:20] it all.
[29:24] My past with its guilt and stain,
[29:32] my guilt and despair.
[29:35] Jesus took on him there
[29:39] and Calary
[29:42] covers it all.
[29:47] How matchless the grace
[29:51] when I looked in his face
[29:55] of this Jesus my crucified
[30:00] Lord
[30:03] my redemption
[30:05] complete.
[30:06] I then found at his feet
[30:11] and Calary covers
[30:14] it all.
[30:19] How blessed the thoughts that my soul by
[30:24] him bought shall be his in the glory on
[30:30] high
[30:33] where with gladness and song I'll be one
[30:39] of the throne
[30:41] and calary
[30:43] covers
[30:45] it
[30:48] [Music]
[30:49] Calary
[30:51] covers it all.
[30:54] [Music]
[30:56] My past with its sin and stain,
[31:03] my guilt and despair.
[31:07] Jesus took on him there.
[31:11] And Calary
[31:13] covers it all.
[31:19] And Calary
[31:21] covers it all.
[31:26] Yes. Calary
[31:29] covers
[31:30] it all.
[31:34] [Music]
[31:41] Amen. Calvary covers it all. It's
[31:43] wonderful. You know, all week long I was
[31:46] thinking it would sure be nice to hear
[31:47] Sister Ruth sing. And I think this is as
[31:50] close as we get to Sister Ruth. Amen.

[31:54] order. We're going to sing that chorus,

[35:07] &gt;&gt; and the more we give of ourselves you'll
[35:09] never regret it.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll receive your reward.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we're really happy about
[35:16] that and uh happy that you're all here.
[35:20] Praise the Lord.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; We're in for a good time.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Mike, for the letter,
[35:28] Brother Mike Ganny. I appreciate that.
[35:30] Amen. You get once a while you get, you
[35:33] know, you get a note, you get a letter,
[35:34] you get a phone call and say, "Thank you
[35:37] for the ministry
[35:40] uh and all the ministry to the bride."
[35:43] But the ones that minister to you,
[35:46] uh, just coming here to the pulpit just
[35:49] now, I I just had a letter, quite a
[35:54] large envelope, and I just opened up. It
[35:56] looked like quite official and looked
[35:58] like it might be something I should uh
[36:02] perhaps know or tend to, maybe something
[36:03] we need to pray about or speak about.
[36:06] and I opened it up and uh a brother that
[36:09] I know really quite well,
[36:12] he said, "This 2010, my wife and I
[36:16] decided that we wanted to write and we
[36:20] wanted to give special
[36:22] uh recognition
[36:25] to important things that have happened
[36:27] in our lives." And they said it was in a
[36:30] meeting
[36:32] that you were preaching
[36:34] and I gave the state that I was
[36:36] preaching in special meeting and they
[36:39] said God spoke through you and healed
[36:42] our home.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; The home was tore apart.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; And God healed the home.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; You know what's wonderful in this day is
[36:52] that God is not interested in raising up
[36:54] personalities. That was back in the days
[36:57] of Pentecost. It was like a personality
[37:00] cult. But today we have a message and we
[37:03] just preach that message. People that
[37:05] receive that message receive the benefit
[37:07] of the message. And often the minister
[37:10] doesn't even know about it.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; And I say, "Praise God.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; All the glory goes to him."
[37:16] &gt;&gt; And we just each one want to be a tool
[37:19] in his hand.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Nice to see Wayne Salon here as well.
[37:25] He's a associate with Milco. So we need
[37:28] to really pray for him and
[37:31] and then they can pray for one another.
[37:34] Uh Wayne worked also with uh uh worked
[37:38] closely with Michael Hunt and uh and uh
[37:42] Michael Mike had a real influence on his
[37:44] life. I believe that would be true. And
[37:47] uh he said when Mike left he said I
[37:50] believe this wouldn't be out of place.
[37:53] Wayne told Milky, "Then my life went
[37:55] downhill and then then God brought you
[37:57] along and now I'm coming back up." Well,
[38:00] that's what we're here for, Wayne. You
[38:02] see that? Come right back up. Amen.
[38:06] I have I have some greetings that I need
[38:08] to just uh give to you. Brother Dioa
[38:11] from the Congo
[38:13] wanted to greet you uh in email this
[38:17] week. and brother Sergey in Moscow.
[38:19] They're in planning on having the
[38:21] dedication of the church in Moscow, Lord
[38:25] willing, on the 1st of May. And we
[38:27] really need to pray for them. They're
[38:29] working so so hard. They won't have the
[38:32] everything everything in place, I
[38:34] suppose, but they just want to have the
[38:36] sanctuary with the washrooms and so on
[38:39] all finished, and they expect to have
[38:41] that done for uh May dedication. And uh
[38:45] so uh there he's asked uh myself if we
[38:49] we can come and be part of the
[38:51] dedication because the church here and
[38:53] the believers have had a big part of
[38:58] uh of building that church and they have
[39:00] worked and saints also in in uh
[39:04] in Europe as well. But we have sent uh
[39:08] uh we sent another $35,000 to them. You
[39:12] know, these people just wouldn't have a
[39:14] place to worship if it is impossible for
[39:17] them to have it if we didn't help them
[39:19] somehow. And I don't think it hurt us.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; None of the believers who gave didn't
[39:24] hurt them and we were able to be a
[39:27] blessing to them. Isn't that wonderful?
[39:29] That's just wonderful. And now three
[39:31] congregations came together so they
[39:33] could fellowship into one place. That's
[39:35] brother Sergey. Brother Garrett Rodal
[39:38] from Germany also was in touch with me
[39:42] and wants to be remembered to you. and
[39:45] brother Andre Pati and I'll be speaking
[39:48] about brother Andre Pati because he has
[39:50] worked extensively
[39:52] in Haiti for many years and they have a
[39:57] printing work in the heart of Haiti
[40:00] downtown in the city and I didn't know
[40:04] if there were believers or how many
[40:06] believers. Voice of God also have an
[40:09] office in uh downtown in the city of
[40:13] Haiti. And I I found out this two days
[40:17] ago, there's two 2,000 believers in the
[40:21] church in in the city of part of Prince
[40:24] itself. And so I'm going to be speaking
[40:27] about that a little bit later on. So we
[40:30] want to remember them as well.
[40:34] Now, I'm going to have you uh turn in
[40:37] the scripture if you would,
[40:40] and we can turn to uh 1 Corinthians the
[40:43] 15th chapter.
[40:45] And uh once you give you a moment to get
[40:49] there, then we're going to just have a
[40:50] word of prayer.
[41:09] I would like to say also about uh the
[41:12] prayer meetings that that have been here
[41:15] in the church and they've had it in the
[41:17] fellow in the chapel for years and uh I
[41:21] I already had it on my heart and I had
[41:24] been speaking to some other brothers and
[41:27] I wanted to I felt I'd like to have a
[41:29] change in the prayer meeting and uh have
[41:33] it in in the fellowship room and change
[41:37] the order of it a wee bit and encourage
[41:40] the people and I have not attended very
[41:44] few of the prayer meetings but I felt in
[41:46] my heart I want to be there so often I'm
[41:49] studying or visiting on a Friday evening
[41:52] but I just feel to to we need to get
[41:56] together and have a time of prayer about
[41:58] specific things at this time. And so we
[42:01] want to be making a formal announcement
[42:03] on that. And then for those of you that
[42:06] might be concerned about the meetings
[42:07] during February,
[42:09] especially while the Olympics are taking
[42:11] place here, and it's kind of an unknown
[42:13] thing, but we have decided to make some
[42:16] arrangements. So we have some meetings
[42:19] uh on this side, our regular services,
[42:22] and also on the US side for those that
[42:24] just find it almost impossible to get
[42:26] across the border. We don't know what
[42:28] kind of lineups or what kind of uh
[42:31] situation will be and we just don't want
[42:33] to make it overly burdensome to the
[42:36] people. So, we'll be making that
[42:37] announcement as well. Everyone feeling
[42:40] fine?
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just have a word of prayer.
[42:45] Dear Lord Jesus,
[42:48] thinking this week and as I was
[42:49] answering someone's mail, I thought of
[42:53] the words and how I hear your messenger,
[42:57] your prophet, our precious brother
[42:59] Brandham. How I hear him speak and
[43:03] speaks of you and he tells people how
[43:08] lovely
[43:09] &gt;&gt; you are.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Isn't he lovely?
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh Lord, this morning I want to
[43:15] say before these people that you are
[43:18] indeed the lovely one.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; And I pray that there will be the
[43:22] presence of the Holy Spirit that will
[43:24] just brood over the people that everyone
[43:27] will feel in their heart. There'll just
[43:29] feel their heart warming and there'll be
[43:31] a presence there. Lord, as the people
[43:34] had remained standing and respect to the
[43:36] word now, which we are going to read,
[43:39] all of this would be in vain unless you
[43:41] would come and punctuate it with the
[43:44] Holy Ghost. We want the Holy Spirit to
[43:47] have absolute control of the meeting.
[43:49] Lord, we pray you'll save the lost. We
[43:52] pray you will loose those that are
[43:54] bound. We ask that you'll come and heal
[43:57] those that are sick. We pray father that
[43:59] you will give revelation of your word so
[44:02] it won't be some dead letter but it will
[44:04] be a living fire within our bones in the
[44:08] name of Jesus Christ. Bless the people
[44:10] now and all those on the streaming uh
[44:13] wherever they might be in the world we
[44:15] say God blessing upon them. Amen.
[44:20] In 1 Corinthians 15, I'm going to read
[44:24] verse 49 down to 52.
[44:29] And as we have borne the image of the
[44:31] earthly, we shall also bear the image of
[44:35] the heavenly.
[44:37] Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and
[44:40] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
[44:44] Neither do corruption inherit
[44:46] incorruption.
[44:48] Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall
[44:51] not all sleep, but we shall all be
[44:54] changed in a moment, in the twinkling of
[44:57] an eye, at the last trump. For the
[45:00] trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall
[45:03] be raised incorruptible, and we shall be
[45:07] changed.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is a promise out of the mouth
[45:12] of God and it cannot he will not uh move
[45:16] away from that. He won't change his mind
[45:19] about his word. In uh Revelation 21,
[45:23] there's one verse. I'll just read it for
[45:25] you. And I saw a new heaven and a new
[45:28] earth. For the first heaven and the
[45:31] first earth were passed away and there
[45:34] was no more sea. a new heaven and a new
[45:38] earth. That'll be a change.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; And I want to speak on conditions for
[45:45] change. Think about that as you have
[45:47] your seats.
[46:05] Now, you'll need to focus as just as be
[46:10] as alert as you can because I want to
[46:14] take some of the things that are
[46:15] currently happening
[46:17] uh regarding the destruction in Haiti.
[46:21] But it was so fitting and was completely
[46:25] uh compatible with the message this
[46:27] morning because I had been studying
[46:31] uh and preparing on this change and the
[46:34] conditions for change. You know, you
[46:37] have to have I just want to take my time
[46:39] a little bit now. You you have to have
[46:42] certain conditions for change. There are
[46:44] many of us uh I'm I suppose most all of
[46:48] us that we desire change.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; If you're sick here this morning, you
[46:54] desire to be restored to health and
[46:57] that's a change. I I know it can be so
[47:00] sudden that you can just be afflicted
[47:03] with something and just in a moment you
[47:05] cannot do what you did an hour ago. You
[47:09] are restricted. You are hampered. You
[47:11] are ill. You are perhaps prone in bed.
[47:15] You just you and you need you need
[47:18] something to happen and there are
[47:20] certain conditions which perhaps have to
[47:23] be met in order to have that uh in order
[47:26] to bring about that change. There may be
[47:29] those and there are obviously from time
[47:32] to time we experience financial
[47:35] reversals and financial difficulties and
[47:38] the world has experienced what they call
[47:40] the meltdown and we've had a a huge huge
[47:45] losses. People have lost they've worked
[47:48] all their lives and they've lost their
[47:50] pensions. They've lost their uh equity
[47:53] in their 401k. They've lost their RRSPs
[47:57] on this side. They've lost their equity
[48:00] in their homes and maybe they had other
[48:02] property and maybe even lost that and
[48:04] lost their home period. Uh they need
[48:07] change.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; They need something to happen. And there
[48:11] may be those without work even today
[48:14] that do not have enough to pay this
[48:17] month's bills. They need something to
[48:20] change, something to happen. And uh so
[48:23] we we have that that's just that's just
[48:26] common place. That's something that uh
[48:28] we all experience and there isn't anyone
[48:31] I don't suppose anyone here but what we
[48:34] desire change sometimes things go
[48:37] sideways in our relationships you know
[48:40] within a family or within a church or
[48:43] within a within a country or wherever
[48:45] more and we need something to bring
[48:47] about change very often you need a a
[48:51] leader and I'm glad we have a leader
[48:54] called a great shepherd and he's master
[48:57] of change.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; And this scripture which we read, we
[49:01] have borne the image of the earthy.
[49:03] Well, that's no mystery. We're all
[49:05] sitting here and we're very much
[49:07] subjected to the earthy. But Paul says,
[49:10] "And we shall also bear the image of the
[49:14] heavenly." And that's a change we don't
[49:16] want to miss at all. That's something
[49:18] that wants we want to u uh anchor our
[49:22] faith in that
[49:24] &gt;&gt; flesh and blood cannot enter into the
[49:26] kingdom of God and neither does
[49:28] corruption inherit incorruption.
[49:32] And today and in the last few days,
[49:35] we've been made so so mindful of the uh
[49:38] terrible calamity uh that has taken
[49:41] place in uh in in Haiti and in uh
[49:45] especially in the city of uh Port of
[49:47] Port of France. Uh uh I spoke with
[49:51] brother Andre Pati as I said a few
[49:53] moments ago and I spoke with him at at
[49:56] length. We had a a lovely conversation.
[49:58] and I we know each other very well and
[50:02] brother Andre felt years ago that he
[50:05] wanted to do something to for the
[50:07] message for the people in Haiti uh and
[50:11] they set up a printing operation and so
[50:14] as we've been doing for example in India
[50:17] and and many other countries uh he has
[50:21] uh focused on Haiti and his church which
[50:25] is in just east of Montreal
[50:28] uh he's they they have been working and
[50:30] he's been making many many trips down
[50:32] there. So my purpose for calling him was
[50:35] because you you you hear of some of
[50:38] these uh just disasters that take place
[50:42] as we've had in the Philippines
[50:43] recently. I think about four typhoons
[50:47] and uh and then you know believers have
[50:51] lost their homes and uh but I always
[50:54] thank God because I have a certain
[50:57] confidence that God is sparing his
[50:59] people
[51:00] &gt;&gt; and that's very important. We have a
[51:03] protection our Jehovah God is a
[51:06] protector
[51:07] &gt;&gt; of his people as well.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:10] But there there's just one I I just want
[51:12] to you know make known uh just one of my
[51:16] own inner feelings when I hear of uh of
[51:20] uh disasters and so often people get
[51:23] completely swallowed up in the emotion
[51:25] of the moment and I always feel it's
[51:28] better to do something that is on a
[51:31] long-term basis than just throw money at
[51:34] a problem that is just with no program
[51:37] no plan no anything else As uh as the
[51:41] saying goes, if a man needs some food,
[51:43] if he needs a fish, you're better off to
[51:46] buy him a fishing pole and then he goes
[51:49] and catches his own fish. And that way
[51:51] he can catch it today and catch one
[51:53] tomorrow and catch one if you just buy
[51:55] him a fish. That's all he's got. And so
[51:58] it's much much better if you give help
[52:00] on a on a a on an extended basis. We had
[52:05] one just recently and I'm just telling
[52:07] you these things because it's all part
[52:08] of my message today and it'll be quite
[52:10] different. But we had one recently where
[52:13] a a a pastor in the Philippines and he
[52:17] was quite young. He just suddenly died
[52:21] and he left a a congregation, left a
[52:24] wife with I think eight children and uh
[52:27] and and so word was sent out. And today
[52:30] of course you know word travels very
[52:32] very quickly. I receive it and maybe
[52:35] thousands of other people receive it on
[52:37] the internet and however more. So,
[52:39] somebody sends $50 and some $200 and
[52:42] some $500. And so, here we sit, but you
[52:46] don't know really what's happening, how
[52:49] is she being cared for? And quite
[52:52] frankly, what are her needs? We don't
[52:54] know what the needs are. What are the
[52:56] needs of the family? And so I sent word
[52:58] right away and I said, "Well, of course
[53:01] we're interested in helping the sister,
[53:04] but we want to determine what are her
[53:07] needs and what will her needs, how is
[53:09] I'm not worried about how she'll bury
[53:11] her husband and maybe pay some expenses
[53:14] today, tomorrow, but how will she feed
[53:16] the children next month and this year
[53:20] and next year? What's the program?
[53:22] What's the plan?" and she needs some
[53:24] commitment, you know, from the
[53:26] believers. And uh and so this was the
[53:29] word we sent to our brother over in the
[53:31] Philippines. And brother Ernie has
[53:33] always been very very close
[53:36] uh to anything that happens over there.
[53:38] And so uh uh we we we I wanted to know
[53:43] something else. I said I also know that
[53:47] there are churches in the Philippines
[53:49] which are large churches and there are
[53:51] people over there that are skilled
[53:53] people. Uh for the most part people
[53:56] don't earn big salaries but many of them
[54:00] earn a fairly good living. That would be
[54:02] if you're in Manila or in the in the in
[54:05] a larger centers. So I I wanted to know
[54:09] what are they doing for their own
[54:12] people? What do those churches do? It's
[54:15] not enough just to put your hand out and
[54:17] and hope that you know overseas and
[54:20] America and Europe will uh uh will be
[54:23] the answer all what are we doing for
[54:25] ourselves and what are the people doing
[54:28] there. So I wanted to know that those
[54:30] churches are also going to sacrifice and
[54:33] help uh help with the sister's needs and
[54:37] uh so it different information then
[54:40] began to uh come in to us and uh and the
[54:44] sister was very I thought she just did
[54:47] absolutely excellent. They were out in a
[54:50] very rural and in a poor area and so on
[54:53] and uh and she took some funds that she
[54:56] had received and set up a little market,
[54:58] a little bit of a store. And she's got
[55:01] children which are grown and can help
[55:03] her and now they have a little bit of a
[55:06] store and they they sell things and that
[55:10] way she has a living. And I thought that
[55:12] was very nice. And so we offered also to
[55:15] help. And we I said, "We'd like to find
[55:18] out exactly what does she need per
[55:20] month." And and it was all sorted out.
[55:23] And the brother over there, they went
[55:26] over all the things that she would need
[55:28] for her and a family. And about $400 a
[55:31] month, uh helped her. And and we did
[55:34] exactly the same thing with a sister who
[55:37] lost her husband. She's a young sister.
[55:39] She lost her husband in China. Well, we
[55:42] didn't want to just, you know, as I
[55:44] said, throw money at a problem. We want
[55:46] to know what is the degree of the
[55:48] problem. What is her needs? And brother
[55:52] Murphy did exactly the same thing. I
[55:54] asked him to find out and he came back
[55:57] and she needed X amount per month. And
[56:00] so we here as a church, we weren't
[56:02] willing to wait for anyone else. We just
[56:05] said we will provide those funds for her
[56:08] every month for a year. So, she knows
[56:11] that she will be looked after uh for a
[56:15] year. And I think it was even before the
[56:17] year was over that we got word back that
[56:20] she's being cared for and she doesn't
[56:22] need our assistance anymore. And that's
[56:25] the way I think the body of Christ
[56:26] should work. Doesn't that sound good to
[56:28] you?
[56:30] &gt;&gt; So, that's why I was calling brother
[56:31] Andre Pati. I don't know. I know little
[56:35] or nothing about Haiti. I've left that
[56:37] to people that uh you know speak the
[56:39] French language and are very close and
[56:43] uh I knew that brother brother Andre
[56:46] Pati and his church and and others also
[56:48] I believe in Quebec City had been
[56:50] working uh so I said are there believers
[56:53] there? Well yes he said there's a very
[56:55] nice church of 2,000 believers right in
[56:59] Porta Prince and uh I said where do they
[57:02] worship? He said, "Well, they worship
[57:03] right downtown in the city." And he
[57:06] said, "And uh and the voice of God
[57:09] representative," he said, is a very good
[57:11] friend, a very fine man, and uh for a
[57:15] while he was looking after carrying for
[57:17] the voice of God work. Then he then he
[57:20] gave that up for a season, then he went
[57:22] back to it. So he's working with them uh
[57:25] at this time. And he said he's a very
[57:27] wellbalanced, a very fine man, and spoke
[57:29] very highly of him. He says, "And they
[57:31] have a distribution building there. And
[57:34] I have since discovered that the
[57:37] building where the voice of God is, I
[57:39] understand, is is collapsed. And the
[57:42] building where brother Andre Pati's
[57:45] printing work is collapsed." And but he
[57:48] spoke to the brother who's in charge of
[57:50] brother Abraham who's in charge of his
[57:52] printing work. And they have said that
[57:56] he was he was not injured. So we thank
[57:59] God for that. We do not know about
[58:02] others, but amongst 2,000 people, uh I
[58:06] would imagine that there there there
[58:09] must be uh uh incredible needs even for
[58:13] the essentials of of food and water and
[58:18] some medical things and so on. So I said
[58:21] to brother Andre, we they they have a
[58:24] website and uh and you can get the
[58:27] website from brother Kim and you can
[58:30] donate if you wish directly there. We're
[58:32] going to take an offering this morning,
[58:34] but you may not be ready for it. That's
[58:36] fine. But you can also give in uh you
[58:39] can just give it to the office and just
[58:41] put it to Haiti and and we will send it
[58:43] on your behalf uh directly. Uh there's a
[58:48] possibility and I don't know uh just the
[58:51] logistics of it but the Canadian
[58:54] government has agreed to match all
[58:57] donations that are made to a to a
[59:02] uh a recognized charity which we are and
[59:06] we'll be giving to brother Andre Pati
[59:08] and he's a recognized charity and so I
[59:11] don't know just how that works but uh
[59:14] have you looked into some of that
[59:15] brother Kim? how yeah how that works. So
[59:18] uh there's a possibility that whatever
[59:20] we give they may match that or whatever
[59:23] you give and we'll keep track of it. So
[59:25] put your name if you would on the
[59:27] envelope if you wish or however you wish
[59:30] to do it and uh but we'll take up an
[59:33] offering at the end of this service but
[59:35] you can also bear this in mind at the
[59:38] same time. Uh I got word also from
[59:44] uh brother Andre on on the 14th uh
[59:48] January couple days ago
[59:51] and he said that we had no news up until
[59:53] today when I was finally able to speak
[59:56] to brother Abraham
[59:59] for a few seconds before the line was
[1:00:02] out. There had been no communication
[1:00:04] whatsoever. Brother Abraham works at the
[1:00:08] message printing shop. we have been
[1:00:10] operating out of Haiti for the past few
[1:00:13] years. He just had time to tell me that
[1:00:17] by the grace of God, he was doing okay,
[1:00:21] that he hadn't heard about any believers
[1:00:24] losing their lives, but that the
[1:00:26] building owned by brother George uh
[1:00:29] Lamar, I believe it is, where the
[1:00:32] printing shop was set up, was in ruins.
[1:00:35] and brother George's in-laws property
[1:00:38] where brother Guy Contave uh lives.
[1:00:42] Brother Guy is responsible for the voice
[1:00:44] of God distribution is also totally
[1:00:48] ruined and we will keep you posted as
[1:00:50] soon as we have any developments. I have
[1:00:53] asked brother Pati because he had been
[1:00:57] scheduled to uh fly and be there on
[1:01:00] January the 27th
[1:01:03] and uh so he felt when he when the
[1:01:06] earthquake took place and everything
[1:01:07] that he was not going to try to change
[1:01:09] his schedule. He just try to stay with
[1:01:11] the schedule because there's no flights
[1:01:14] that other than military and aid flights
[1:01:16] that are being allowed right now. So, he
[1:01:19] plans to go on the 27th. And then I
[1:01:22] received a call and I believe this will
[1:01:24] be all right to brother Randy Snow uh
[1:01:28] was made was in contact or people from
[1:01:32] Phoenix who he has work done work for
[1:01:35] called him and asked him if he would
[1:01:38] also go to Haiti as uh and and
[1:01:41] contribute two weeks of his time because
[1:01:44] they need team leaders to uh assist with
[1:01:47] getting uh construction and some
[1:01:50] temporary
[1:01:52] uh structures up. And so, Brother Randy
[1:01:55] was asking me about the believers that
[1:01:57] are there because they will obviously
[1:01:59] need to employ some believers. And so,
[1:02:01] you can pray with Brother Randy. He's
[1:02:03] just uh praying about this now. He's
[1:02:06] supposed to leave also in a couple
[1:02:07] weeks. So, if you go there, Brother
[1:02:09] Randy, you'll be there at the same time
[1:02:12] that Brother Andre Pati is there and you
[1:02:15] could work together with him. So, we
[1:02:18] don't know how much involvement that
[1:02:20] this will all be. But I do know that if
[1:02:23] there's believers that are in need, uh
[1:02:27] uh it's up to us to have compassion and
[1:02:32] to do what we can. Uh I just have some
[1:02:35] some slides here quickly and I suppose
[1:02:37] most of these you have seen, but uh
[1:02:40] maybe we could dim the lights a wee bit.
[1:02:42] Please, the house lights. And so we
[1:02:44] could just see these now.
[1:02:57] And I trust I I have I have not taken
[1:03:00] the most shocking uh of but all of those
[1:03:03] are bodies and the people are standing
[1:03:04] there. They have up till yesterday
[1:03:07] morning they have buried 40,000
[1:03:10] people and they have no idea of how
[1:03:13] many. We've heard 50,000. Then we've
[1:03:16] heard 200,000. And they don't know.
[1:03:19] They've just had to put them into mass
[1:03:21] graves. Here's a man stepping over
[1:03:24] bodies and probably looking for
[1:03:28] his relatives.
[1:03:31] Uh a woman finally getting a a drink of
[1:03:35] water.
[1:03:38] There's a building that's completely
[1:03:40] collapsed. That is a school. And it's
[1:03:44] unfortunate. You see a pair of legs out
[1:03:48] there. People are there's one one school
[1:03:51] of 700 children
[1:03:54] totally collapsed and they don't hear
[1:03:57] any sound of life in it. And another
[1:04:00] school of 300 and it totally collapsed.
[1:04:05] Now this is a calamity.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; But friends don't forget this is not a
[1:04:10] greatest calamity is coming. Right.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; We've already been we've already been
[1:04:16] spoken very specifically of what is
[1:04:19] taking place.
[1:04:21] But you can imagine, you know, this is
[1:04:23] just a few hours away on a plane and
[1:04:26] you'd be uh there uh trying to determine
[1:04:30] what what is life all about.
[1:04:33] Uh this is from St. Gerard Technical
[1:04:38] School.
[1:04:41] There's an entire building is just open
[1:04:44] on one side
[1:04:47] and I saw one touching picture where a
[1:04:50] man is telling the people he's saying
[1:04:53] tell them to be quiet because he's
[1:04:55] trying to hear. They're tapping and
[1:04:58] they're trying to hear if there's anyone
[1:05:00] tapping on the inside if there's any
[1:05:02] life. They just pulled a little baby out
[1:05:05] that was and she's fine. A little girl.
[1:05:09] She was in there for 68 hours and I
[1:05:12] don't know how she lived but she seems
[1:05:15] to be fine.
[1:05:18] This man,
[1:05:20] his daughter passed away.
[1:05:34] This is the difficulty there, Randy,
[1:05:37] which I know you've seen as well, but
[1:05:40] the the scope of the the scope of the
[1:05:44] destruction.
[1:05:45] It's not merely the scope of it, but the
[1:05:48] United Nations from Geneva said this
[1:05:50] week, "This is the greatest disaster
[1:05:55] since the United Nations was formed."
[1:05:58] And that this is a greater disaster than
[1:06:00] the tsunami which took over almost
[1:06:04] 300,000 lives, more death, but but they
[1:06:09] had the infrastructure in place there.
[1:06:12] The police were still in place. The
[1:06:15] military was still in place. The
[1:06:17] government was still in place. And the
[1:06:19] United Nations used these words. Haiti
[1:06:23] has been decapitated
[1:06:25] because the police building collapsed
[1:06:27] with the police in it. Uh government
[1:06:30] buildings are destroyed and it is a
[1:06:32] country without any real uh direction at
[1:06:37] this time. And if it were not for the
[1:06:39] United States that went in to take some
[1:06:40] leadership, uh we're we're happy about
[1:06:43] that. And Canada sent ships out
[1:06:46] immediately. A hospital ship is on its
[1:06:49] way and uh several hundreds of soldiers
[1:06:52] and everything because they have to try
[1:06:53] to maintain order.
[1:06:57] So now we have members of the Polish
[1:07:00] uh search and rescue team get ready to
[1:07:03] depart for Haiti.
[1:07:06] And this is the French medical aid
[1:07:08] organization,
[1:07:10] uh, doctors of the world, and they're
[1:07:13] checking their list for their stuff.
[1:07:15] This is the Nicaraguan soldiers load a
[1:07:17] plane with humanitarian aid. Here's the
[1:07:21] Chinese search and rescue team getting
[1:07:23] ready to depart Beijing airport and
[1:07:26] they're being instructed by an officer.
[1:07:29] There's a medical equipment being loaded
[1:07:31] from Venezuela.
[1:07:33] There's over 20 nations. Look at this.
[1:07:35] This is a German Red Cross member walks
[1:07:38] through uh the medicine boxes and
[1:07:41] humanitarian
[1:07:42] aid at the logistical center in Berlin.
[1:07:46] And this is a another one here from the
[1:07:49] either I believe uh this one is either
[1:07:52] from the States or Canada. I believe
[1:07:54] it's the US.
[1:07:57] A Spanish rescuer with a 2-year-old
[1:08:00] cloud after he's rescued from a
[1:08:03] collapsed home. Does he have any
[1:08:05] parents? We don't know. Many of them
[1:08:07] don't.
[1:08:10] This is a very recent This morning
[1:08:12] picture. Injured girl is fed uh by a
[1:08:17] volunteer at the hospital in Porta
[1:08:18] Prince. And incidentally, the hospitals
[1:08:21] are out in the yards
[1:08:25] here. They're receiving water.
[1:08:28] Uh, and there's been such a shortage
[1:08:33] and they jostle each other during water
[1:08:36] distribution here.
[1:08:38] This is the golf course which is this is
[1:08:41] from this morning and they're making a
[1:08:44] makeshift camp and and they're just tens
[1:08:47] of thousands of people. They don't have
[1:08:49] any home. They don't have anything
[1:08:51] anymore. This is the backyard of a
[1:08:54] hospital and this is what it looks like.
[1:08:58] The hospital of course isn't able to
[1:09:00] hold any more people. I thought this was
[1:09:03] very moving, very touching. This is also
[1:09:06] from this morning. They've got a a
[1:09:09] machine and this woman.
[1:09:13] She's alive and conscious, but she's
[1:09:16] buried under the collapse university
[1:09:19] and excuse me. And they've not been able
[1:09:22] to get her out at the time that I had
[1:09:25] this photo.
[1:09:28] And a girl here could be any girl here.
[1:09:32] She's comforts her injured mother at a
[1:09:36] market in Port of France.
[1:09:40] And so that is those uh pictures which I
[1:09:45] thought it would be fine to show those.
[1:09:50] So we can shut that off now. Thank you.
[1:09:53] Have our lights back up.
[1:10:01] I expect that it's quiet,
[1:10:04] but I would like to say
[1:10:08] because I been speaking and I want to
[1:10:10] speak to you on the conditions for
[1:10:13] change.
[1:10:16] These people need a change.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; I think you would agree with me. They
[1:10:23] need a change. And so the nations of the
[1:10:26] world reacted.
[1:10:29] Yes, we'll come there from 20 nations or
[1:10:33] more. In comes the aircraft. In comes
[1:10:37] the soldiers. In comes the medical team.
[1:10:40] They left here from Vancouver
[1:10:42] immediately after they heard of it.
[1:10:44] firefighters are coming from different
[1:10:46] countries and all kinds of workers and
[1:10:49] police and medical aid and and a school
[1:10:53] group from over in uh eastern British
[1:10:55] Columbia are there and they they just
[1:10:57] come from churches and all over a church
[1:11:00] in Pennsylvania. They they loaded up
[1:11:02] their people and and flew into an
[1:11:05] adjoining country and drove people in
[1:11:08] nurses and just people to try to help.
[1:11:11] And then there's there those are
[1:11:12] wonderful stories. And then you hear the
[1:11:15] very saddest story. Some sad stories. A
[1:11:18] woman from here went there just to do uh
[1:11:23] excuse me do some you know to give
[1:11:25] herself and she was she was had landed
[1:11:29] in Porta Prince and was there 90 minutes
[1:11:32] when the earthquake took place and she
[1:11:34] was killed.
[1:11:36] And you have these, you know, you
[1:11:38] wonder, well, why do good bad things
[1:11:40] happen to good people or they have good
[1:11:42] intent. But what we have now is is so in
[1:11:47] keeping with where I want to project
[1:11:49] this in a spiritual sense as well. We
[1:11:52] have all of this aid. We have all of
[1:11:55] this outpouring
[1:11:57] of compassion. You have all of this
[1:12:00] desire that's pent up and built in
[1:12:03] within the people. And people want to do
[1:12:05] things that they can't even do. Do you
[1:12:07] know why? Because there isn't a there
[1:12:09] isn't a channel open.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; There are. And so people are busy trying
[1:12:15] to put channels together. And you've got
[1:12:17] to create certain conditions. They can't
[1:12:20] get they can't get the aid from the
[1:12:23] airport to the people because of the
[1:12:26] conditions, the the the roads, the
[1:12:29] destruction, but and no equipment to do
[1:12:32] things. So my my principal thought is
[1:12:35] you've got to have you must have
[1:12:38] conditions in order for change to
[1:12:41] happen. There's certain conditions that
[1:12:44] have to be met. And as as as as much as
[1:12:46] we would twist and turn and say, well,
[1:12:48] something has to happen. I just feel,
[1:12:50] oh, God, something has to happen. But
[1:12:52] there has to be some real conditions
[1:12:55] take place. There may have to be skilled
[1:12:57] people. There may have to be now I want
[1:13:00] you to think about in the in the
[1:13:02] spiritual sense as well. There has to be
[1:13:05] certain things in place and then a a a
[1:13:08] channel. I'll just stay with this uh uh
[1:13:12] the the Haiti situation for a moment. uh
[1:13:15] the it it would only be natural I think
[1:13:17] that the uh president of the United
[1:13:20] States, President Obama, who's the
[1:13:22] highest officer of the wealthiest
[1:13:25] nation, I would guess uh at least it's a
[1:13:29] a super power, the super power
[1:13:31] recognized on the earth. It would it is
[1:13:34] only right. And I I just saw him on the
[1:13:37] MSNBC news on my computer and he and he
[1:13:40] stands forward and says, "We say to the
[1:13:44] people of Haiti that uh we will be there
[1:13:48] uh and you will not be forgotten." In
[1:13:50] other words, we're committing ourselves
[1:13:52] to be there for uh for the long term.
[1:13:56] Then he realized now that's the channel
[1:14:00] you see and the the the I want you to
[1:14:03] get my thought now because this is
[1:14:05] important. That's the channel. He's he's
[1:14:08] he's the one there isn't anyone else who
[1:14:11] could gather that kind of force and make
[1:14:15] the kind of financial commitment to to
[1:14:19] bring the people together and to direct
[1:14:22] things. He realized he needed more. So
[1:14:25] he called two previous presidents,
[1:14:28] Clinton and Bush, to his side, asked
[1:14:31] them if they would assume responsibility
[1:14:35] to see that this continues and that this
[1:14:38] doesn't get out of focus and because a
[1:14:42] president of a nation such as the United
[1:14:44] States is having many many other things
[1:14:47] to deal with and while other things are
[1:14:49] being dealt with the economy or the
[1:14:51] health care and all of these things,
[1:14:53] they don't want to lose sight of Haiti
[1:14:56] and its needs because it's not going to
[1:14:58] be resolved in 30 days. It's not going
[1:15:01] to be resolved in. So now you have the
[1:15:03] three things you have my my subject that
[1:15:06] the the things need desperately to
[1:15:09] change.
[1:15:11] Some you may be in a situation. I want
[1:15:14] you to apply the principle. We get into
[1:15:17] situations in life spiritually and even
[1:15:20] naturally or emotionally or whatever
[1:15:23] other way. I don't know. Even the devil
[1:15:25] may have been talking to you this last
[1:15:27] week saying, "Well, that's just
[1:15:28] hopeless. What is hopeless?" Because
[1:15:31] something inside of you say uh this
[1:15:34] needs to change or I need to change or
[1:15:37] this relation relationship needs to
[1:15:39] change or my physical health needs to
[1:15:42] change something. Oh God where's the
[1:15:45] answer? Well I tell you in order for it
[1:15:48] to change you have to have conditions.
[1:15:50] There are certain conditions that need
[1:15:52] to change. And the conditions are uh the
[1:15:56] change is dependent on the conditions.
[1:15:58] With this right here that I've just
[1:16:00] showed you, unless they got equipment to
[1:16:02] clean up the streets, they won't have a
[1:16:04] change. Unless they get people, skilled
[1:16:07] workers, willing workers, compassionate
[1:16:10] people, compassionate nations. You can
[1:16:12] have all of that. You can have all the
[1:16:14] desire you want, but it has to it has to
[1:16:17] filter down into the real world. It has
[1:16:19] to filter down into real work and then
[1:16:22] and then change can happen. But even
[1:16:25] that can't happen unless there's a
[1:16:28] channel. Now this is going to really
[1:16:30] this is going to take you on a surprise
[1:16:32] in a few moments.
[1:16:33] You've got to have a channel and it's
[1:16:36] got to be a channel in this case. And on
[1:16:38] behalf of Haiti, I will say that uh
[1:16:41] President Bush him uh not President
[1:16:43] Bush, but President Obama, President
[1:16:45] Bush and President Clinton joining
[1:16:48] together. But the one the president
[1:16:51] who's in place, he's he he's an elected
[1:16:54] channel and he's the one who is is is
[1:16:59] authorized. He's the one who can say,
[1:17:01] "We're going to commit, you know, these
[1:17:03] hundreds of millions of dollars. We're
[1:17:05] going to do this and we're going to
[1:17:07] bring about a a change and we're going
[1:17:09] to stand with these people." And that is
[1:17:12] uh that's about the only way that it can
[1:17:15] really happen. But now as believers,
[1:17:21] we know that this world
[1:17:26] is due
[1:17:27] for a catastrophic events
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; that make this like kindergarten.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; That's what this book says.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; And it is going to happen.
[1:17:43] And now we've had a prophet in this
[1:17:46] generation, not just a preacher, but a
[1:17:49] prophet.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to this congregation
[1:17:52] today before you lose the effect of the
[1:17:55] pictures which you just saw. And you'll
[1:17:58] agree with me there needs desperately to
[1:18:00] be change. You'll agree with me, I'm
[1:18:03] sure, that there must be conditions for
[1:18:05] that change. And you'll agree with me
[1:18:07] that there must be a channel that is
[1:18:10] ordained by the authorities or the by
[1:18:13] the powers. And in our case, in the
[1:18:15] spiritual sense, the authority can only
[1:18:18] come from almighty God. He's the
[1:18:21] authority. And he says he will do
[1:18:24] nothing. N O T H I N G. He will do
[1:18:29] nothing, but he will show it first to
[1:18:32] his servants, the prophets. Now you have
[1:18:35] the channel
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; and that's the channel that the creator
[1:18:40] is using
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; and I have it all through the message
[1:18:43] and we have it all through the
[1:18:44] scripture. God will do nothing. And so
[1:18:48] then today it would be only uh it would
[1:18:51] be the greatest trickery of the enemy
[1:18:55] for us to dilute or to play down what
[1:19:00] the prophet messenger and I'm standing
[1:19:03] here before you today as sometimes a
[1:19:06] troubled person because I will speak to
[1:19:09] individuals or speak to families to say
[1:19:11] well the messenger the messenger let's
[1:19:14] say it another word the channel,
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; a higher channel than the president of
[1:19:20] any nation.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; I expect that you would say amen to
[1:19:26] that. The highest channel, the highest
[1:19:29] office
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; that's been given to a human
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; in this entire age was given to that one
[1:19:36] man.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; And what he says came to pass. and what
[1:19:44] still remains unfulfilled will come to
[1:19:47] pass.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; He he speaks of in the future home. So
[1:19:54] this is something that we look forward
[1:19:57] to. He said in this new earth, the skies
[1:20:01] will never black again. No, he said
[1:20:03] that's from the curse. What we've seen
[1:20:06] on the screen is just a little trickle.
[1:20:09] I didn't even show the worst which
[1:20:10] you've seen them. But it's just a it's
[1:20:13] just infotal of the suffering that's
[1:20:15] happening and the agony that's going on
[1:20:17] this morning while we sit here in the
[1:20:19] comfort of this church. People are out
[1:20:22] there. They don't have any livelihood.
[1:20:24] They don't have any food. They don't
[1:20:25] have any future. They don't have a home.
[1:20:27] They don't have nothing. Nothing.
[1:20:30] They've been reduced to less than even
[1:20:32] the animals that can look after
[1:20:34] themselves. They're so dependent. They
[1:20:36] have nothing. Right?
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; But that's just a toothache
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; compared to what this world is in for.
[1:20:43] The prophet of God said that this earth
[1:20:45] will belch.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; And he said furthermore when he
[1:20:49] prophesied of the destruction of
[1:20:51] California, he said Los Angeles will
[1:20:54] sink below the ocean.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; And he said it'll be like Capernium
[1:20:59] which could never be found again. It's
[1:21:02] going to lay below the ocean. And he
[1:21:04] said, "The ocean will weep its way clean
[1:21:07] into the desert, clean into the salt and
[1:21:10] sea." Is that what he said?
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; That is the author. That is the creator
[1:21:15] who created. He said, "You people talk
[1:21:18] about hell." He said, "The earth, the
[1:21:20] earth is a bubbling. It's it's a
[1:21:22] belching uh of molten rock. You're on
[1:21:26] hell every day." Right.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; And he said when that takes place in
[1:21:32] California, he said it'll be worse than
[1:21:35] the days of Pompei, the last days of
[1:21:37] Pompei. I have visited Pompei on two
[1:21:40] occasions. And I had my family there uh
[1:21:44] a year or so ago and and there's people
[1:21:46] that has sprawled out there. You you can
[1:21:49] see them clawing trying to make their
[1:21:52] way out of the building. and and and by
[1:21:55] the time uh uh Vuvius, I believe it was,
[1:21:59] Mount Vuvius, it it it poured down over
[1:22:04] 60 ft of ash, hot burning uh chemical
[1:22:11] ash on the people and and they just they
[1:22:14] they're caught in their motion. They're
[1:22:16] caught in their attempt to escape. And
[1:22:18] the prophet says, "This will be worse
[1:22:20] than the last days of Pompei." I tell
[1:22:23] you friends, people want to ask, well,
[1:22:26] uh, you know, will we have a chance
[1:22:27] then? I wouldn't even attempt to have a
[1:22:29] chance then. This is your chance.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; This is your time.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; This is a time to take serious what God
[1:22:36] has said.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "There be no more the curse.
[1:22:43] Never will it be black again with angry
[1:22:46] clouds. Winds will never blow across her
[1:22:49] again." We're talking about behold I
[1:22:51] make a new heaven and a new earth. My
[1:22:53] brother, my sister, this world is due
[1:22:56] for a change. I'm going to declare to
[1:22:59] the top of my lungs and with all the
[1:23:01] force and energy I have, you can have
[1:23:04] this world. I want the one the prophet
[1:23:06] speaking about.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; I want the one that Jesus spoke of, I'll
[1:23:11] make all things new. There'll be a new
[1:23:13] heaven and there'll be a new earth
[1:23:15] wherein will dwell righteousness and
[1:23:18] justice for all. Hallelujah. That's a
[1:23:22] promise to you. And it came in this age
[1:23:25] through God's ordained channel. Amen.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "No, she'll never tear up the
[1:23:33] trees and tear up the houses and turn
[1:23:36] over the things and lightning and the
[1:23:39] wrath will never belch from Satan across
[1:23:42] there and kill a man walking down the
[1:23:45] road or burn up a building. No, no more.
[1:23:48] There'll be no more typhoon sweep down."
[1:23:51] We could say to the Philippines,
[1:23:52] "There'll be no more typhoons you've had
[1:23:55] four just recently." And they'll hear
[1:23:57] this message in the in the Philippines
[1:23:59] as well. There'll be no more of that.
[1:24:02] There'll be no more winds to come down
[1:24:04] and to kill and destroy and to wrench
[1:24:06] family members one from the other. Be no
[1:24:09] more man standing there holding his his
[1:24:11] dead baby.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Death will be destroyed.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Here we have too much of it. But death's
[1:24:22] an enemy.
[1:24:25] Right.
[1:24:28] No more typhoons and tornadoes to tear
[1:24:30] up houses and kill little children and
[1:24:33] things. Won't be no more trying to
[1:24:36] destroy. It won't be there. Satan is
[1:24:39] cast out.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; And I believe that there's a life that
[1:24:43] we have within us as a believer today
[1:24:45] according to the word of God, eternal
[1:24:48] life for the believer. And it's that
[1:24:50] life that's going to that's going to
[1:24:52] experience and live in that in that
[1:24:55] heavenly place. It's not some pie in the
[1:24:57] sky. The same messenger said it's like
[1:25:00] going through the doorway from the
[1:25:02] elements of the interior to the elements
[1:25:04] of the exterior. He said it's just a
[1:25:06] door. That's all it is. These bodies are
[1:25:10] going to they're fading away right now
[1:25:12] while we're sitting here. We're getting
[1:25:14] older. But there is a land.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. where we won't have these
[1:25:19] things anymore and we don't have death
[1:25:22] and we won't need money and we won't
[1:25:24] have rotten politics and all of these
[1:25:27] rotten things. My friends, we're on our
[1:25:29] way out of here according to God's word.
[1:25:32] And if we don't have God's word, then we
[1:25:35] might as well all pack it in and just
[1:25:37] give it up. But this is the truth.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; This is yay and amen. Amen.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; And you can make all the promises and
[1:25:45] have all the wishes and all the desires
[1:25:47] that you want and all the plans, but
[1:25:49] they'll fail.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; And this will not fail.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; This is thus saith the Lord.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth have met. He said
[1:26:01] that's what he's talking about now.
[1:26:03] Heavens and earth have met and God and
[1:26:07] man is reconciled. Here we come back now
[1:26:10] to the messages I've been speaking on. A
[1:26:13] restored Eden has begun.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; I say, when did it begin? Well, if it
[1:26:20] hadn't begun already, it began when he
[1:26:23] said those words.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; You might think I'm a fanatic, but I'm
[1:26:27] going to go the whole distance this
[1:26:29] morning. You can call me as big a
[1:26:31] fanatic as you want. But when God the
[1:26:34] author had his agent on earth, a prophet
[1:26:39] vindicated prophet messenger, what was
[1:26:42] coming out of his mouth was creation.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; What was coming out of his mouth was
[1:26:47] judgment.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; What was coming out of his mouth was
[1:26:50] both restoration and destruction.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; That's what he has a prophet on the
[1:26:58] earth for. He is a messenger. a
[1:27:02] messenger to tell the people what's
[1:27:04] happening.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Things that are covered, he uncovers
[1:27:08] them. This is really what's happening.
[1:27:10] And this is what's taking place. You may
[1:27:13] think, "Oh, everything is going. We we
[1:27:14] live in a nice country and all the rest
[1:27:16] of it, but you need a prophet to say
[1:27:18] it's rotten to the core.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; This country and every country."
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "And all the curse is gone."
[1:27:31] Now he's we've gone from the what what
[1:27:34] is going to pass away to what it will
[1:27:35] be. And the curse is gone just like all
[1:27:38] the curse of sin is gone when the Holy
[1:27:40] Ghost accepts you.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; You don't accept it. It accepts you cuz
[1:27:47] go cuz it's God's attribute.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; He said if you were see yet you were
[1:27:52] born in sin but God had that attribute
[1:27:56] and here you expressed yourself here on
[1:27:58] earth. That's what you're doing today.
[1:28:01] You express yourself here on earth and
[1:28:04] he comes down and gets you. So you're
[1:28:06] back here. He said, "Here's where you
[1:28:08] belong. Sin's lost its power."
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Let the congregation say it. Sin's lost
[1:28:15] its power.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Lost it power.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Unbelief has lost its power.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; It may hear, but it may be around. You
[1:28:24] may hear it all over, but it's lost its
[1:28:26] power. It's lost its effectiveness. You
[1:28:29] say, "Well, how do you know?" Because
[1:28:31] the the authorized voice said it.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; And that's where you have to pin your
[1:28:37] hope, your faith, and confidence. God's
[1:28:40] messenger said it.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; It's not that I say it and that I feel
[1:28:45] inspired. He said it. Sin lost its
[1:28:48] power.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Unbelief has lost its power.
[1:28:54] G.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Don't forget it.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit comes in. You are a
[1:29:03] restored person.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; You are a restored person.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; If I wasn't before, if you believe this
[1:29:10] now, say God's messenger said it, you
[1:29:13] are a restored person. And Satan and sin
[1:29:16] has lost its power. You don't ever have
[1:29:18] to listen to him again.
[1:29:21] Amen.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Who's the devil compared to a prophet of
[1:29:26] God?
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's Lucifer himself.
[1:29:29] Lucifer comes to you may show himself up
[1:29:32] and say, "Uh uh, I'm going to do this
[1:29:34] and I'm going to do that and you're
[1:29:36] going to lose your mind and you're
[1:29:37] depressed." You say, "I've got a higher
[1:29:40] authority than you. I have a prophet
[1:29:43] from Almighty God who says, I am
[1:29:46] restored.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; I am restored.
[1:29:51] I have a prophet messenger who said you
[1:29:54] and sin has lost its power.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Unbelief has lost its power.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; If I can get you to believe that today,
[1:30:02] you'll walk a different kind of a life.
[1:30:04] You'll have a different kind of a home
[1:30:06] and family. It'll be different from here
[1:30:08] on out.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you can just get that
[1:30:13] concept that almighty God speaking
[1:30:16] through a vessel on earth.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; He said he could have had the son preach
[1:30:21] the gospel. He could have had the winds
[1:30:23] preach the gospel, but he chose man to
[1:30:26] preach the gospel. He wants to use your
[1:30:28] mouth as a testimony, as a witness, but
[1:30:31] he used and there's all kinds of
[1:30:33] vessels. But this this one now is God's
[1:30:36] authority.
[1:30:37] Uh Haiti needed President Obama as a
[1:30:42] channel. We've got another channel.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; And you, those of you that are familiar,
[1:30:47] you know all about channels. You know
[1:30:49] all about formats. And you've got to get
[1:30:51] in the right channel.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; People got a history channel and they
[1:30:55] got a memory channel and all of these
[1:30:58] different channels. And you can't get if
[1:31:00] one is a channel on a television 62. You
[1:31:04] won't get it at 52.
[1:31:06] It's got to you got to be in that right
[1:31:08] channel. You got to get in that right
[1:31:10] format. You've got to get right in that
[1:31:13] channel and and agree with all of your
[1:31:16] heart that this is God's channel.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; This is called a prophet channel. Not a
[1:31:22] history channel, not an imagination
[1:31:24] channel, a prophet channel.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; And he said certain things and those
[1:31:30] things can never fall.
[1:31:34] No word can go to the ground
[1:31:36] unfulfilled. It will be fulfilled.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; When it says Los Angeles will sink and
[1:31:42] slide beneath the ocean, you count on
[1:31:44] that.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; That's more certain than your dinner
[1:31:47] this afternoon. More certain than you
[1:31:49] sitting where you are today. It will
[1:31:51] slide. People say, "Well, how, where?"
[1:31:53] Don't don't worry about that. God knows
[1:31:55] how and where and when.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; And it'll be that way.
[1:32:01] Yes. Yes, sir.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; And this, as you saw for 25 pictures, is
[1:32:06] just a it's not even a kindergarten
[1:32:08] stuff.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; It's not even a toothache
[1:32:13] compared to what there was. I saw a man
[1:32:15] on a documentary and he's from the
[1:32:17] Pentagon
[1:32:19] and he was standing on an overpass with
[1:32:22] Los Angeles behind him and he speaks
[1:32:25] into the camera and he said, "This is
[1:32:28] Los Angeles behind me." said, "They're
[1:32:31] talking about the earthquake." He said,
[1:32:33] "I'm not saying if it comes, I'm saying
[1:32:36] when it comes." He says, "And we've
[1:32:39] studied this." And he was from the
[1:32:41] Pentagon. And he he he's part of the
[1:32:44] official department of the government. I
[1:32:46] don't remember just exactly what the
[1:32:48] government what part of it now, but he
[1:32:50] was saying and he had write down the
[1:32:52] specifics. He said, "We have in United
[1:32:55] States 200 serious burn units." 200 in
[1:33:00] the whole nation of serious burn units.
[1:33:04] He said when this earthquake takes
[1:33:07] place, he said there will be probably
[1:33:10] upward of 100,000 people in need of
[1:33:14] serious burn units and we don't have
[1:33:17] them. He said we don't have enough
[1:33:19] medication. We don't have enough pain uh
[1:33:23] relief for the number of people that
[1:33:26] would be calling for it at that time. In
[1:33:28] fact, and he said this plainly, he said,
[1:33:30] "Don't feel sorry for the people that
[1:33:33] die. Feel sorry for the people that are
[1:33:36] alive."
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; That's just a man of the world,
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Tom.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; That's just a man. He he I don't know
[1:33:43] where he is today, but these are these
[1:33:46] are officials. These are speaking things
[1:33:48] that they know. Say, "Oh, God, where can
[1:33:51] we hide?" You can hide in Christ.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; You can hide this morning. I'm showing
[1:33:56] you where the shelter is. We have a
[1:33:58] protector.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, they could drop an
[1:34:01] atomic bomb right on top of this church
[1:34:04] and no one would get killed if that was
[1:34:06] God's will. And then we could be
[1:34:08] vaporized into another dimension because
[1:34:11] what man devised cannot destroy the
[1:34:14] believer.
[1:34:16] [Applause]
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; We are beyond that. He that believeth on
[1:34:21] me shall never die.
[1:34:24] that came out of Jesus mouth
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; and we believe it
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; and now he sent another mouth in this
[1:34:30] generation
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; and that's the mouth we believe
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; that's it just rejoice in it
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; confess it
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; so you know we have there make great
[1:34:52] enormous efforts
[1:34:54] We make a lot of efforts. We
[1:34:58] We got a church building here or we have
[1:35:00] perhaps the internet and we got people
[1:35:03] that stream and people that uh work with
[1:35:06] the tapes and in the audio and in the
[1:35:08] visual and and all of these things and
[1:35:10] you're out there and you're working and
[1:35:12] you're giving and the effort that's
[1:35:14] being made, the desire that there is
[1:35:16] within the believer, oh God, that we can
[1:35:18] reach one more that we can help
[1:35:20] somebody. I tell you what, do what you
[1:35:23] can do while you can do it.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Witness while you can. There will surely
[1:35:27] come a day and you won't even be able to
[1:35:30] do like you say, "Well, if I could do
[1:35:31] something for the people in Haiti, you
[1:35:33] don't have the channel. You don't have
[1:35:35] the you're not enabled to do it." But
[1:35:38] you are here.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; You're here able to do something uh uh
[1:35:44] within the call of God. You know, things
[1:35:46] that the world doesn't know. Your
[1:35:48] neighbors don't know.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:35:51] And they're a reality, friends.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "And when they shall
[1:36:00] say peace and safety, then sudden
[1:36:04] destruction cometh upon them as travail
[1:36:07] upon a woman with child." And notice
[1:36:10] these words, "They shall not escape."
[1:36:15] Who's God speaking to? Who's God
[1:36:17] speaking about? Who are they? Whoever
[1:36:20] they are, they shall not escape.
[1:36:24] You might not have thought that, well,
[1:36:26] I'm going to come to church this
[1:36:27] morning. We're going to sit there and we
[1:36:28] have a song service and hear some
[1:36:32] specials and hear a message.
[1:36:36] Listen, friends,
[1:36:38] we must not take this message casual.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Even to this present moment that we're
[1:36:46] in. And I don't care what kind of
[1:36:49] situation you get in, what kind of
[1:36:51] conversation you have, you make sure
[1:36:53] it's seasoned with what the prophet of
[1:36:55] God has said.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; I have absolutely been a gasast
[1:37:02] in recent months when a when a prophet
[1:37:06] messenger will make a certain statement
[1:37:08] concerning uh our individual life or
[1:37:11] concerning the church or concerning the
[1:37:13] offices of the church and there's a
[1:37:15] tendency well just to downplay it.
[1:37:17] doesn't it's not that important. And I
[1:37:19] have people I've had people even get
[1:37:21] offended.
[1:37:24] And I quoted I said, "Well, what was
[1:37:27] it?" They said, "Well, you said such and
[1:37:29] such and such and such." I said, "Well,
[1:37:31] just a moment." And I thought, "What was
[1:37:33] it?" And as I begin to say it, I
[1:37:36] recognize it was a quote. I said, "Well,
[1:37:39] that's a direct quote. I wasn't I
[1:37:41] reading a quote? Wasn't I reading a
[1:37:43] quote from the prophet's message?" And
[1:37:46] and the brother said, "Well, well, yeah,
[1:37:47] yeah, you were." I said, "Well, do you
[1:37:50] have a problem with what the prophet of
[1:37:53] God has spoken?"
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Well, no, not really. But I mean, the
[1:37:56] thing was there was a problem.
[1:37:59] Don't ever have a problem
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; with what he spoke.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; I don't care how it strikes you or how
[1:38:05] it affects you. You put your feelings
[1:38:07] down and stop down on it and say, "What
[1:38:09] he said, that's that's what my
[1:38:11] confidence is in." Because even this old
[1:38:15] life of mine or yours could pass away.
[1:38:17] I'm not interested in people's feelings.
[1:38:19] I'm not interested. I've gone beyond
[1:38:21] that. Now, God's not even interested in
[1:38:23] my feelings.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, that hurt me." So, it hurt.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Just say, "Praise God, it hurt, but it's
[1:38:31] the truth anyway."
[1:38:34] [Music]
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:38:41] See, you can say amen, but I don't even
[1:38:43] need you to say amen. I'm going to
[1:38:45] preach it anyway
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; because this precisely God's word.
[1:38:50] We've been here all of these years and
[1:38:52] for one purpose to make known what the
[1:38:55] messenger of the hour has said to to to
[1:38:59] do everything within our power and
[1:39:01] within our ability and to use our gra
[1:39:04] our resources to see that someone else
[1:39:06] will have it that someone else can read
[1:39:09] uh uh this message I got restoration of
[1:39:11] the of the bride tree I've been reading
[1:39:13] it was going to speak even more on it
[1:39:16] how I would love how I respect
[1:39:19] Brother Andre Pati or Voice of God or
[1:39:23] Brother Momus when he was living and all
[1:39:25] of these people and brother Perry Green
[1:39:27] that put books together. You never hear
[1:39:29] me say one word contrary to that. I
[1:39:33] thank God for every effort. I thank God
[1:39:36] for every printing press that's in the
[1:39:38] country. And people have things say,
[1:39:40] "Well, we don't do that." I wouldn't
[1:39:42] boast about that. I think every church
[1:39:44] should be involved in it. Say, "Do what
[1:39:46] we can.
[1:39:51] Amen.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; If you're a believer
[1:39:55] and you do plan to cross beyond the
[1:39:57] curtain of time, and you will.
[1:40:00] One thing's for sure, if you're a
[1:40:01] believer, you're going to meet the
[1:40:03] messenger of this day.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:08] Hallelujah.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't suggest that we would
[1:40:13] want to say, well, you know, we just
[1:40:15] stayed, you know, a little quiet. Us
[1:40:17] four and no more.
[1:40:20] We didn't have any concern for anyone
[1:40:22] else. I want to be able to run up.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; I want to be able to say, "Brother
[1:40:27] Brandon,
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; the message God gave you, I'm so
[1:40:31] thankful you were so true to it.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't let money or popularity or
[1:40:36] anything change it. Amen.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; You were uncompromising with it
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; and we tried to stay true to it and we
[1:40:43] tried to get it into every person's hand
[1:40:45] that we possibly could.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; We used every channel, every avenue to
[1:40:49] get it out. Encourage the people to get
[1:40:51] it out.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; That's the most important thing.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; What can be more important than thus
[1:40:56] saith the Lord.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; And God gives us the privilege to let
[1:41:02] someone else know what thus sayith the
[1:41:04] Lord has said.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:08] Amen.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; For as it was in the days that were
[1:41:16] before the flood,
[1:41:18] they were eating and drinking and
[1:41:20] marrying and giving in marriage until
[1:41:21] the day that Noah entered into the ark,
[1:41:23] and they knew not until the flood came
[1:41:26] and took them all away. So also shall
[1:41:29] the coming of the Son of Man be.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; God has done things and he's taken the
[1:41:34] world by surprise. No one even
[1:41:36] understood when this little prophet
[1:41:40] messenger stood before the people and
[1:41:44] God begin to put him forward with uh
[1:41:47] indescribable healings.
[1:41:49] How would you have been? How would you
[1:41:51] have reacted? And I don't know where the
[1:41:52] people are. They were sitting in the
[1:41:54] building when they handed him that
[1:41:56] crippled and twisted up child into his
[1:41:59] arm and the bones begin to snap and
[1:42:02] crackle and the child was made whole and
[1:42:05] leaped out of his arms and a little uh
[1:42:08] uh little sister playing the piano like
[1:42:10] an Amish Amisher or something and she
[1:42:13] was playing the piano, the great
[1:42:15] physician now is near the sympathizing
[1:42:17] Jesus and she jumped away from the
[1:42:20] piano. But the moment the prophet said
[1:42:22] were so sacred that the piano continued
[1:42:25] to play the great physician now is near
[1:42:29] the sympathizing Jesus. Those things
[1:42:31] happened and God is introducing that
[1:42:34] kind of how wouldn't you listen? How
[1:42:36] wouldn't you hear that kind of a voice
[1:42:37] again?
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; I would say it would be it would be
[1:42:41] absolutely ludicrous not to hear it and
[1:42:44] to believe it and what he says is the
[1:42:47] absolute
[1:42:49] Amen.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; And he judged everything by the word.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; And someone said to him, "Did the angel
[1:42:58] tell you that?" He said, "If the angel
[1:43:00] told me anything contrary to the word of
[1:43:02] God, I wouldn't believe the angel."
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of messenger I I have a
[1:43:08] lot of confidence in.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; That message unfolds this word. You
[1:43:16] know, this is a mysterious word. Yes.
[1:43:19] Yes, sir.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; With all of the history and mankind and
[1:43:22] theology and all the studies and all the
[1:43:26] volumes of encyclopedias and and
[1:43:29] translations, still they cannot find the
[1:43:32] some of the most simple things.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; It makes me so embarrassed to think that
[1:43:39] we have to have a messenger come and
[1:43:42] say, "In the beginning, God created the
[1:43:44] heavens and the earth."
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Period.
[1:43:48] And here we got all this intellectualism
[1:43:50] and they can't find that period.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; He said it might have been 800 million
[1:43:56] years, might have been hundreds of
[1:43:57] millions of years before when when God
[1:44:00] was doing all this creation. They think,
[1:44:02] well, he did he did all this in 24
[1:44:04] hours. Brother B says it wasn't in 24
[1:44:07] hours. He said those seeds were laying
[1:44:09] beneath the water and the word of God
[1:44:11] was spoken and at some point in all of
[1:44:14] the eons of time when when God said it,
[1:44:17] it was going to come forth and those
[1:44:19] seeds had to bring forth light. And so
[1:44:21] he said, "Let there be light." And the
[1:44:23] light came and the sun drew near the
[1:44:26] earth and the seeds came forth. And not
[1:44:29] one bit different than today, the son of
[1:44:31] man, the revealing of the son of man in
[1:44:35] that ministry drew near to you because
[1:44:37] you had a seed in your life
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; and that seed had to come forth.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; It had to come forth
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; and there was no other way because
[1:44:49] that's the order. That's the channel.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; God's not changing his mind. said,
[1:44:57] "Well, I'll I'll use the moon or I'll
[1:44:59] use some other planet." God's using the
[1:45:02] sun to bring forth life because it's a
[1:45:04] type of the son of God
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; drew near to you
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; to bring forth life.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; If you want to listen to a service, any
[1:45:15] of you unfamiliar, you ought to listen
[1:45:16] to the last 20 minutes of choosing of a
[1:45:18] bride.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; He said this solemn warning.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; That's a solemn warning. He said, "We
[1:45:27] don't know what time and you don't know
[1:45:30] what time that this city one day." This
[1:45:33] was spoken in Los Angeles,
[1:45:36] California. You don't know what time
[1:45:38] this city one day is going to be laying
[1:45:41] out here in the bottom of this ocean.
[1:45:45] They might have not known it before.
[1:45:48] and all the seismographs and the
[1:45:51] earthquake centers which I have spoken
[1:45:53] to here in this area. I've spoken to
[1:45:56] them because they have major
[1:45:57] earthquakes, many every month, but they
[1:46:00] said most of them are deep in the ocean
[1:46:02] and you don't hear of them. and uh and
[1:46:05] the Denver, Colorado is where they keep
[1:46:07] they have the center for the world, but
[1:46:09] because of new technology and new
[1:46:12] sensitive equipment and so on, the man
[1:46:14] told me that they're and this is some
[1:46:16] years ago that they're already three
[1:46:18] years behind reporting the earthquakes.
[1:46:25] Don't ever think for a moment we're
[1:46:26] going to have an earthquake and then I'm
[1:46:28] going to get right with God or that will
[1:46:31] be a moment that I will really you know
[1:46:34] no that just isn't going to happen.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; It's going to be laying out here at the
[1:46:40] bottom of this ocean and he cries out oh
[1:46:42] capernium
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; said Jesus thou art thou who exaltth
[1:46:47] into heaven will be brought down into
[1:46:49] hell. For if the mighty works had been
[1:46:52] done in Sodom and Gomorrah, it had been
[1:46:55] standing till this day. And Sodom and
[1:46:57] Gomorrah lays at the bottom of the Dead
[1:47:00] Sea, and Capernium's in the bottom of
[1:47:02] the sea. Thou city, now he begins to
[1:47:05] prophesy against Los Angeles. thou city
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; who claims to be the city of the angels
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; who's exalted yourself into heaven what
[1:47:15] they call their celebrity stars
[1:47:19] said you have exalted yourself into
[1:47:21] heaven and sent all the dirty filthy
[1:47:24] things of fashions and things till even
[1:47:26] the foreign countries come here to pick
[1:47:28] up your filth our filth and send it away
[1:47:31] with your fine churches and your
[1:47:34] steeples and so forth the way you Do
[1:47:37] remember one day
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; I want you to remember that this is the
[1:47:42] channel.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; The channel
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; God will do nothing but he reveal it to
[1:47:48] his secrets of prophets. Now this
[1:47:50] prophet proven vindicated for over 30
[1:47:54] years is giving the announcement the
[1:47:58] prophecy. Your fine church is in
[1:48:00] steeples. I want you to remember one day
[1:48:03] you'll be laying at the bottom of this
[1:48:05] sea and your great honeycomb uh under
[1:48:09] you right now. The wrath of God is
[1:48:11] belching right beneath you. How much
[1:48:14] longer he'll hold this sandbar hanging
[1:48:17] over that when that ocean out yonder a
[1:48:20] mile deep will slide in there plum back
[1:48:23] to the salt sea. He said it'll be worse
[1:48:26] than the last day of Pompei. Repent, Los
[1:48:30] Angeles. Repent, the rest of you and
[1:48:33] turn to God. The hour of his wrath is
[1:48:36] upon the earth. Flee while there's time
[1:48:39] to flee and come into Christ. He said,
[1:48:42] "Let us pray." And then he began to
[1:48:44] pray. Dear God, when in my spirit is
[1:48:47] shaking, I'm sure Ezekiel could have
[1:48:50] said that. I'm sure Daniel and Isaiah
[1:48:53] could have said the same thing. My
[1:48:55] spirit is shaking. My heart is dropping.
[1:48:58] teardrops of warning. Grant, oh God,
[1:49:01] that men and women will not think of
[1:49:03] what I've said as a joke and that the
[1:49:05] church people will not think of that it
[1:49:08] is something that was prejudice or
[1:49:10] against them. May they see, Lord, it is
[1:49:13] it's in love
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; that thou beest me record, Almighty God,
[1:49:18] that up and down this coast I have went
[1:49:21] year after year proclaiming your word.
[1:49:25] Amen.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Bear me record, oh God.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; It would if it would happen tonight. I
[1:49:31] hold I've told the truth and thou
[1:49:34] knowest that this vision of the bride is
[1:49:37] the truth.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; So now we have a vision of the
[1:49:41] destruction of a vast city of millions
[1:49:44] of people.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; And he spoke of he said listen even to
[1:49:48] the words hanging over that sandbar.
[1:49:51] There was a large corporation in
[1:49:53] Vancouver called Hydro Dynamics
[1:49:58] and they made they made the uh like a
[1:50:00] Pisces investigative submarine and they
[1:50:04] deep submersible submarines and it came
[1:50:08] really into the forefront here because
[1:50:10] they had one loaded on a boat and they
[1:50:13] had another one loaded on a flat deck
[1:50:15] ready to go to the boat and the Canadian
[1:50:18] government was sending them uh to Russia
[1:50:20] had bought them and the United States
[1:50:22] put pressure on Canada and said hey we
[1:50:27] we we don't want you to send them and
[1:50:29] there was a bit of a tough uh over it
[1:50:31] and Canada said well they're made in
[1:50:33] Canada there our technology and so on
[1:50:36] and the United States said that is
[1:50:37] correct but you have used some American
[1:50:40] technology and and parts in that
[1:50:44] submarine and uh and so Canada with
[1:50:47] their good friendship with America
[1:50:48] decided to cancel the shipping shipping
[1:50:50] of these ships of these boats out there.
[1:50:53] The reason I was so keen about it, I was
[1:50:56] actually uh it looked as though I was
[1:50:58] going to have to go into their plant and
[1:51:00] appraise them because they had gone uh
[1:51:03] they were going into bankruptcy because
[1:51:05] of these things. Now, I don't know exa
[1:51:07] exactly what happened to them
[1:51:08] eventually, but I can tell you this. I
[1:51:10] got a very very keen interest in it. And
[1:51:13] then a big article because the newspaper
[1:51:15] in the city of Vancouver very keen on
[1:51:17] it. It was a large corporation and it
[1:51:19] was a big article in the Vancouver
[1:51:20] province. I've looked for it since but I
[1:51:23] I've not been able to find it but it was
[1:51:26] a large article. I remembered on the
[1:51:27] bottom of a page and they were re they
[1:51:31] were telling of the account of whether
[1:51:33] it was one of these subs or whether it
[1:51:35] was one of the American uh research
[1:51:37] submarines, but they were off the coast
[1:51:40] of California on the continental shelf
[1:51:43] and they had the they they they had a
[1:51:46] mother ship and they uh they had a
[1:51:49] research submarine that was doing
[1:51:51] research down on the ocean floor and
[1:51:54] they're just moving along very very
[1:51:55] slowly. And there I think it was a
[1:51:57] twoman sub. And while it was moving, it
[1:52:00] it it bumped into something which wasn't
[1:52:02] uncommon. So they just changed their
[1:52:05] position and continued to move on and
[1:52:08] maybe raised it up a wee bit and
[1:52:10] continue to move on and then bump it
[1:52:12] into something else. And so they decided
[1:52:14] to uh uh contact the mother ship to get
[1:52:18] a bearing of where they were. And they
[1:52:21] determined from the mother ship that
[1:52:24] they were one mile under the coast of
[1:52:28] California that there's actually water.
[1:52:30] And they said there they said in this
[1:52:33] article that it was it was like a great
[1:52:36] uh a great bench and it was being
[1:52:38] supported with huge uh huge sandstone
[1:52:44] pillars like it was pillars and and they
[1:52:46] they were there underneath California,
[1:52:49] the state of California. And the word
[1:52:51] they used it was it was like it was
[1:52:54] honeycombed.
[1:52:55] I never forgot it.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; It was like my I got goosebumps all over
[1:53:01] me
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; and a prophet crying out against Los
[1:53:05] Angeles. And he said there
[1:53:16] should be laying at the bottom of this
[1:53:18] this bottom. He said, "Your great
[1:53:21] honeycomb under you right now."
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; I've held that in my heart all these
[1:53:30] years.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; You say, "All these years, these years
[1:53:34] are just
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; nothing." We're talking about God of
[1:53:39] eternity. But the creator spoke through
[1:53:43] a vessel standing right in that city
[1:53:48] declaring your honeycomb is going to
[1:53:51] give way and you're going to slide into
[1:53:54] the ocean. And then we had I think of
[1:53:56] this church I'm reminding some of you
[1:53:58] that we're not here but some of you that
[1:54:00] were here and it's good to be reminded
[1:54:02] once again. Professor uh Dr. Jacobs from
[1:54:06] the University of Madras uh stood right
[1:54:10] here in this platform in our church and
[1:54:13] his specialty is the earth structure and
[1:54:17] he went right to this this part where
[1:54:20] brother Brandham said is this honeycomb
[1:54:22] is going to slide into the ocean. I was
[1:54:26] over in Madras and and and I had to wait
[1:54:29] a little bit because there were uh there
[1:54:31] was a delegation from Moscow that was
[1:54:34] there and he was to speak to them and uh
[1:54:37] because he because of his knowledge of
[1:54:39] the earth's crust and everything he was
[1:54:41] an expert on mining and and the the
[1:54:44] makeup of the earth's crust and
[1:54:46] different kind of materials and so on.
[1:54:48] And so when he stood here on the pulpit,
[1:54:51] he went to this quote. He went to this
[1:54:54] uh prophecy of brother Brandham and he
[1:54:56] said when when brother Brandham used the
[1:54:58] word it will slide into the ocean. He
[1:55:00] said I'd like to tell you of the
[1:55:02] structure of the earth's crust under Los
[1:55:05] Angeles. And he began to give the
[1:55:07] different materials that were present
[1:55:09] there. And he says and there's a whole
[1:55:12] band before it comes to the solid hard
[1:55:15] bedrock. There's a whole band. And he
[1:55:17] said the best explanation I could give
[1:55:18] it to you that you would understand.
[1:55:20] It's like graphite and it's just very
[1:55:23] smooth. He says and that is precisely
[1:55:26] when that earthquake takes place. He
[1:55:28] said it the structure of the earth in
[1:55:30] this and the design of it. He said it's
[1:55:32] literally going to slide into the ocean.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Friends, we didn't need that. But it's
[1:55:38] nice to have it confirmed by a believer,
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; who is also a scientist who knows about
[1:55:43] it, about the about the earth. And
[1:55:45] whether we live to see it, I trust not.
[1:55:48] I trust we'll be gone. I've had lots of
[1:55:50] people say, "Well, are we going to be
[1:55:52] here during that time?" Well, if you're
[1:55:54] in Christ, you have nothing to fret
[1:55:56] about anyway.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; You're not going to be caught up with it
[1:56:01] anyhow. But I will say to you today, and
[1:56:04] I feel incredibly moved what you've seen
[1:56:07] on the screen today, friends, that has
[1:56:10] happened in our time. It is decapitated
[1:56:13] according the United Nations, a whole
[1:56:15] nation of 9 million people, and they
[1:56:18] have no they have no infrastructure.
[1:56:20] They have no no government or anything
[1:56:23] to to run them. The nations of the world
[1:56:26] are going to have to come and help them.
[1:56:28] But I'll say this to you, those that
[1:56:30] were in Christ, I thank God there's
[1:56:33] believers amongst them,
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; and I I pray that those believers will
[1:56:37] be sustained and will have the necessary
[1:56:40] things of life.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; And we want to do whatever we need to
[1:56:44] do. We're not here for offerings. We're
[1:56:46] not here to pump for that. That we're
[1:56:48] way beyond that. What we're pumping
[1:56:51] today is that God sent his voice.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you woring with me?
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not, you know,
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; yelling too loud,
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; but I am I am moved.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; This is our message.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; This is our messenger.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is our safety net.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; We don't need all the social things and
[1:57:16] all of these things. I thank God for
[1:57:18] them. I thank God for every doctor and
[1:57:20] and doctors without borders and the
[1:57:23] people who go down there and the smile
[1:57:25] those doctors that work under a smile
[1:57:27] and so on which we've had we've had them
[1:57:29] even here became believers. I thank God
[1:57:32] for that. But friends, you want to have
[1:57:35] a bomb shelter made out of feathers
[1:57:38] under his wings. Will we trust?
[1:57:41] Hallelujah.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:44] You want to have a provider that's
[1:57:46] called Jehovah Gyra.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You want to have a healer in
[1:57:51] a time like this when we can say our
[1:57:54] trust is in the almighty God.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; And I saw a new heaven
[1:58:07] and a new earth. You know why I'm going
[1:58:11] to close right now. I've been a little
[1:58:12] longer than I want to be,
[1:58:14] but you ought to read birth pains.
[1:58:17] Can I just give you a few lines?
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Now, she knows, speaking of this earth,
[1:58:26] this one you're sitting in, this one
[1:58:28] that you're enjoying,
[1:58:31] now comes the now comes the actual
[1:58:35] breath of God
[1:58:38] through a chosen vessel's mouth.
[1:58:42] And she knows her time of deliverance is
[1:58:44] at hand. This is just before he's taken
[1:58:47] off the earth in 65.
[1:58:50] And she knows she must give way. Said
[1:58:53] even the earth knows it.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; The world knows that her birth pains is
[1:58:58] so great that she's got to give way.
[1:59:00] There's going to be a new birth born at
[1:59:04] hand. And I'm thankful for that. I'm
[1:59:07] tired of this one. Do you agree with
[1:59:09] him? Amen.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Sound like a lot of you still are happy
[1:59:14] with it. We're tired of this one.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Anyone knows that's here. It's a place
[1:59:19] of death
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; and sorrow
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; and all kinds of discrepancies and so
[1:59:25] forth. I'm glad that you have to give
[1:59:27] away. I'm glad that the time is at hand.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Continues on. She's totally rotten.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Her politics and systems is just as
[1:59:37] rotten as they can be. Amen.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; I've just been reading the history of
[1:59:41] the MOSSAD and uh and all the
[1:59:43] entanglement with the CIA and with the
[1:59:46] FBI and the KGB in Russia and the uh
[1:59:51] BOSS I believe from from Africa and all
[1:59:54] of the agencies of the world. And when I
[1:59:58] have read it, my wife has been reading
[2:00:00] some of it. I all I can tell you this
[2:00:03] earth at the highest level is rotten to
[2:00:07] the core. That's right.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Absolutely rotten to the core.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; And they show in there in detail how
[2:00:16] hundreds and billions and billions of
[2:00:18] dollars have been passed right into the
[2:00:21] Vatican bank. And it is mafia money,
[2:00:24] tens of billions of money. And Cardinal
[2:00:27] Marinus, who was just sent back to the
[2:00:29] Vatican from from Chicago. And some
[2:00:32] years ago, he was wrapped up in the in
[2:00:35] the case where there was 34 uh a pope
[2:00:39] that only lived for 34 days.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; And that and and David Yallop, if you
[2:00:44] want to get the book called in God's
[2:00:46] name, David Yalop says plainly, and he
[2:00:49] gives the names of several men, he says,
[2:00:51] "I'm not saying that one of these might
[2:00:53] have killed the Pope. I am saying one of
[2:00:56] them did murder the Pope."
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. and they haven't put him in jail
[2:01:01] because they know it's the absolute
[2:01:03] truth. And he unveils, he goes right
[2:01:06] into the banking system of the of the
[2:01:09] Vatican bank and begins to show how
[2:01:11] absolutely corrupt they were.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; They scheme up things that you and I
[2:01:17] don't even know of. All I can tell you
[2:01:19] is when the prophet says in a simple
[2:01:21] term, "She's rotten."
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Then you have to know she's rotten.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Do you have another five minutes?
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; You know what the You know what the
[2:01:36] Vatican was engaged with at that time
[2:01:38] when he was writing that book? David
[2:01:40] Yallop. Y A L L O P. They were engaged
[2:01:44] in the Faulland war was taking place
[2:01:47] with Argentina against England because
[2:01:50] the Faulland Islands down off the coast
[2:01:52] of Argentina.
[2:01:55] But within within the Vatican, they'd
[2:01:58] set up
[2:02:00] I think they called it a G9
[2:02:03] shadow government, world government for
[2:02:06] the whole world. And they had certain
[2:02:08] people were in place. Cardinal Marinus
[2:02:11] was one, the president of Argentina was
[2:02:14] another. And they had these key pl
[2:02:17] people who would step into place for a
[2:02:19] world government.
[2:02:24] And they needed money and they chose
[2:02:26] some wealthy men in Italy and they
[2:02:30] encouraged them said they arranged
[2:02:32] you'll buy this bank and you'll buy this
[2:02:35] bank and soon as these men about three
[2:02:37] of them got these banks then it was
[2:02:39] filtered all through the whole Catholic
[2:02:42] system said all all the nuns your orders
[2:02:46] you will bank at this bank the priest
[2:02:48] will bank at these banks all the all the
[2:02:51] parishioners and have it filtered all
[2:02:53] down. We're going to bank at these banks
[2:02:55] because we're going to make these banks
[2:02:57] big banks. That was all part of the
[2:02:59] scheme. And then those banks became very
[2:03:02] popular and they became with lots of
[2:03:05] deposit of money and they got
[2:03:07] recognition with the IMF, the
[2:03:09] International Monetary Fund. And they
[2:03:12] they could borrow money from other
[2:03:14] nations. They borrowed just under $1
[2:03:17] billion.
[2:03:18] These banks which were in Italy borrowed
[2:03:22] just under $1 billion
[2:03:24] and they and and and they funneled it
[2:03:27] when it came into the bank
[2:03:30] they sent it right into the Vatican
[2:03:32] bank. And because the Vatican is a is a
[2:03:36] nation to itself, it's completely it has
[2:03:38] total immunity. And so when the funds
[2:03:41] came into the Vatican, all track and
[2:03:44] trace was was was
[2:03:47] lost. And when it went out of the bank
[2:03:50] of the Vatican, just listen to this.
[2:03:53] There's a little history.
[2:03:56] It went out of the va the Vatican bank
[2:03:59] and went to France and they bought
[2:04:02] exorcet missiles from France and shipped
[2:04:06] the missiles to Argentina to the
[2:04:08] president of Argentina and he blew
[2:04:11] British ships out of the water with
[2:04:14] British missiles,
[2:04:17] bought with British money
[2:04:20] because they wanted to they wanted to
[2:04:22] see that they that this member of the of
[2:04:25] the world government would maintain and
[2:04:28] actually win that war, which he did not.
[2:04:32] That's how corrupt it is. Now, they
[2:04:34] mention the same people in the Mosad and
[2:04:38] the and and this is all fact. No
[2:04:40] fiction. That's all fact, all names, all
[2:04:44] dates, almost 500 pages.
[2:04:49] And he mentions the same people. And
[2:04:51] when I read that about David Yalop, a
[2:04:54] very very respected uh uh uh reporter,
[2:04:58] and he said because of all of that that
[2:05:00] was happening, this is what happened.
[2:05:05] The pope, the pope died, and another one
[2:05:08] just came in.
[2:05:10] And the secretary, the pope secretary,
[2:05:13] which he inherited, the secretary from
[2:05:14] the last one, the secretary for the pope
[2:05:17] told him
[2:05:19] about this shadow government. And some
[2:05:23] of the people right in the Vatican and
[2:05:24] some of the cardinals are part of this.
[2:05:28] And he told the he told his secretary
[2:05:31] he's going to dismantle it. He's opposed
[2:05:34] to it and he's going to dismantle it.
[2:05:37] And now all of these people were going
[2:05:39] to be dismantled. He goes to bed. He has
[2:05:43] his medication there. And he goes to
[2:05:47] sleep. 2 hours. 2 hours before he passed
[2:05:51] away. That same night, he'd been in
[2:05:54] power 34 days. Two hours before, someone
[2:05:57] within the Vatican had already called
[2:06:00] the undertaker
[2:06:02] to come and get his body. And the man is
[2:06:05] still living.
[2:06:06] He wasn't even sick.
[2:06:10] So, he was poisoned or something. And
[2:06:13] David Yalup says
[2:06:16] he had all of these figures and the
[2:06:18] pictures of the undertakers and when
[2:06:20] they got the call and when they came
[2:06:24] two hours before he died so they could
[2:06:26] be there on time.
[2:06:29] And because of this great upheaval, this
[2:06:31] Cardinal Marsis is sent to Chicago. just
[2:06:34] now recently he's sent back to the
[2:06:36] Vatican and they said he's a prisoner in
[2:06:38] Vatican because he can't really be
[2:06:40] allowed out. He is that corrupt. And
[2:06:43] Marinus has told this reporter he said
[2:06:45] this is a gravy train. They're getting
[2:06:48] so much money, billions and billions of
[2:06:51] dollars from the mafia. And this
[2:06:53] reporter says it's money of
[2:06:55] prostitution.
[2:06:57] It's money of every kind of of of
[2:07:01] gambling. It's money from the lowest
[2:07:04] scum of the earth.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; And sitting there, I tell you, my
[2:07:07] brother, my sister, God had a prophet's
[2:07:11] eyes
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; that could look beyond those fancy robes
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; and all that nice talk.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; This might cost us something. Might cost
[2:07:22] me something. This is on the internet,
[2:07:24] but I'll say it's corrupt
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; to the very core.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; And God's going to judge her.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:32] And the scripture says that God will
[2:07:34] judge her.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; And are you listening to me?
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; And God sent a prophet in this time to
[2:07:40] let us know that that hour has arrived.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; And that is why the world is sinking
[2:07:46] into such a impossible condition. Who
[2:07:50] has the answer?
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; They're grappling with things. Who has
[2:07:54] the answer for the world's problems?
[2:07:56] There's no way. They don't have any
[2:07:58] answer. They're just kind of feeling
[2:07:59] their way through the darkness. You
[2:08:02] might say, "Why is there a great
[2:08:03] meltdown now? Why is all of these things
[2:08:05] happening? Why did the why did the uh
[2:08:08] iron curtain fall? Do you know why?"
[2:08:13] Just one man.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; The vessel. Are you listening? Amen.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; The vessel stood and said, "When
[2:08:23] the Berlin Wall comes down,
[2:08:27] then the old Roman Empire will be back
[2:08:30] in the same cycle that it was when
[2:08:33] Christ was here on earth."
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Who can say things like that? That's
[2:08:39] just one line. It's not a whole book.
[2:08:41] It's not a whole bunch of doctrine. just
[2:08:43] one word out of a prophet's mouth and
[2:08:46] it's already signed, sealed, and
[2:08:48] delivered.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; And when he said that, we didn't see it
[2:08:52] till the wall started going down. I say,
[2:08:54] "God, give us eyes. God, give us a
[2:08:57] believing heart.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; God, give us insight. God, give you and
[2:09:01] I revelation." That's my prayer.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; I didn't come to preach. I just come to
[2:09:10] pour out my heart. Praise God.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; And I'll conclude with this
[2:09:22] same messenger.
[2:09:25] He's got a restoration of the bride
[2:09:27] tree.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; And he's making a declaration here. He
[2:09:31] now the vessel. I want you. He the
[2:09:33] vessel. Not the president of the United
[2:09:36] States. the the prophet of God for the
[2:09:39] whole generation, for this whole age.
[2:09:42] He's making a statement that the bride
[2:09:44] tree and he's talking directly about you
[2:09:48] and about I who've been called into this
[2:09:51] message. We are in a restoration by the
[2:09:55] authority of that word
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; and nothing can change it.
[2:10:01] And then he goes to the future home and
[2:10:04] describes our future home, your home.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; And he describes what Peter says, "The
[2:10:10] heavens will be on fire."
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, sister, when this
[2:10:15] world's on fire, we'll be in the bosom
[2:10:17] of God.
