[0:01] Yay, my children, the Lord would say
[0:02] unto thee this morning, draw thou nigh
[0:06] unto the Lord. Yay, as Ruth did cleave
[0:09] unto Naomi, and was brought into the
[0:11] promised land. Yeah, even so thou, if
[0:14] thou shalt cleave unto the word of the
[0:16] Lord, thou shalt be brought into the
[0:19] promises of the Lord. Yay, thou shalt be
[0:21] brought into my rest, sayaeth the Lord.
[0:23] And as a doctrine dust fall as a dw in
[0:27] this hour, yay, my word is going forth
[0:29] to my servants. Yay, it shall incompass
[0:32] this earth. But except thou be filled
[0:35] with the spirit, thou shalt not know the
[0:37] voice of the Lord. Therefore the Lord
[0:40] would say unto thee, depart thou from
[0:42] iniquity. Yay, clean up thy life. Yay,
[0:45] leave those things behind that are
[0:47] worldly, ye that are fleshly, that are
[0:50] not a desire unto the Lord. For the Lord
[0:52] was saying unto thee in this hour, that
[0:55] except thou doth repent, ye except thou
[0:58] do turn unto the Lord with all thine
[1:00] heart, and be willing to desert that
[1:03] which is behind, yay, the Lord shall not
[1:06] hear thee when he cometh. For the Lord
[1:08] is coming as a bride. For I the
[1:11] bridegroom for his bride. And as a bride
[1:14] doth prepare herself and get herself
[1:16] ready for the coming of the bridegroom,
[1:19] even so must my children get themselves
[1:22] ready even in this hour that they might
[1:25] be ready at my coming, sayeth the Lord.
[1:28] Therefore watch ye and pray, sayeth the
[1:30] Lord. Hearken thou unto my word that is
[1:33] going forth. For my word shall not
[1:36] return unto me v boys, but it shall
[1:38] accomplish those things which I have
[1:40] predestinated, sayeth the Lord, that
[1:43] shall be in the last day. Therefore,
[1:46] hearken thou, hearken thou, turn thou
[1:48] from thine own wisdom. Turn thou from
[1:51] thine own doctrine. Yay, turn thou from
[1:54] that which is led thee in bondage, and
[1:56] turn thou unto the word of the Lord, and
[1:59] thou shalt be set freeh. Yay, my mercy
[2:02] shall be upon thee, sayaeth the Lord.
[2:05] &gt;&gt; Your heads bowed now. Just a moment.
