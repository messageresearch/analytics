[0:00] the standard is the standard is
[0:03] every seed must bring forth after his
[0:06] own
[0:06] kind and god is the first one that
[0:10] prophesied
[0:11] he gave a prophecy god actually
[0:14] prophesied
[0:15] and the prophecy is concerning seed
[0:18] and he comes to the serpent and he says
[0:20] i'll put enmity between you and the
[0:22] woman
[0:23] and between your seed and her
[0:26] seed and her seed was going to be
[0:29] nothing other than the
[0:30] new created seed of almighty god
[0:33] god was god was speaking and prophesying
[0:36] again that
[0:36] he's going to create a new seed and
[0:39] jesus christ would be the beginning
[0:41] of a new creation hallelujah
[0:44] and i say to you today he transformed
[0:48] himself into spoken word
[0:50] and uttered his word and spoke in this
[0:52] generation
[0:53] the spoken word is the original
[0:56] seed and has brought forth
[0:59] original children after his kind
[1:03] and there's a great struggle going on
[1:05] for us to
[1:06] to dilute and to water down and
[1:10] to take away from the emphasis and the
[1:12] importance of it
[1:13] i resist the spirit of this laodicea
[1:17] with everything that's in me i resist it
[1:20] in the name of jesus christ
[1:22] it is the enemy of god
[1:25] and i wanted this church rise up
[1:29] because this is your time to shine
[1:32] this is your time to make yourself known
[1:35] this is your time to
[1:36] be able to tell the world we're not just
[1:39] a church
[1:41] we're sons and daughters of the living
[1:43] god
[1:44] we've been birthed by the eternal seed
[1:46] of almighty god
[1:48] and i refuse to be reduced down
[1:51] to a nominal christian it's a lukewarm
[1:54] generation hallelujah
[1:58] i refuse it in the name of jesus christ
[2:01] and as a servant of christ today i say
[2:04] satan you're defeated
[2:07] hallelujah you perverter of the seed of
[2:09] god
[2:10] you cannot pervert this seed
[2:12] [Applause]
[2:16] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:20] hallelujah
[2:30] he's filled our streets with filth and
[2:32] vile
[2:33] things you rub shoulders with it every
[2:36] day
[2:37] i deny it in the name of jesus christ
[2:40] with everything that's in me i deny it
[2:42] this perverted spirit will have no part
[2:45] of the message
[2:46] i'm not talking about the perversion of
[2:48] the flesh i'm talking about the
[2:49] perversion of the word of god
