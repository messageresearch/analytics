[2:32] leaning on the everlasting
[2:36] arm.
[2:39] Hallelujah. What a fellowship when
[2:42] you're washed in the blood of the lamb.
[2:45] &gt;&gt; You're not joining a church. You're not
[2:46] joining a group. You're not hanging out
[2:48] with some folks. You've been born into
[2:50] the kingdom of God.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the country want to we want
[2:55] to be citizens of. Amen. I want to sing
[2:57] God is good all the time. Number 378. If
[3:00] you could love the presence of the Lord.
[3:05] When you're walking
[3:09] through the valley
[3:12] and the shadows are all around, he says,
[3:18] "Do not fear.
[3:21] God will guide you.
[3:24] He will keep you safe and sound for his
[3:29] promise.
[3:30] &gt;&gt; He has promised.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; He has promised.
[3:34] &gt;&gt; He'll never leave you nor forsake you.
[3:39] And his word is true. God is good.
[3:45] One time
[3:47] he puts a song of in this heart of mine.
[3:54] God is good
[3:57] all the time
[3:59] through the darkest night. His light
[4:04] still shines. God is good.
[4:08] He's so good all the time.
[4:14] We were s
[4:16] [Music]
[4:18] worthy
[4:20] but for us he came to die
[4:25] [Music]
[4:26] with
[4:28] the Holy Spirit
[4:31] last
[4:33] [Music]
[4:40] everlasting.
[4:45] Hallelujah.
[4:49] &gt;&gt; God is good
[4:52] all the time.
[4:55] Puts a song of praise in this part of my
[5:00] God is good. My God is good all the
[5:04] time.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; All the time.
[5:09] His light still shines. God is good.
[5:15] He's so good.
[5:18] All the time we were sinners.
[5:23] We were so unworthy.
[5:26] But for us, he came to die
[5:32] and fill us with
[5:35] the Holy Spirit.
[5:39] and testify.
[5:43] [Music]
[5:48] Hallelujah.
[5:51] &gt;&gt; It's your mercy. It will never
[5:55] [Music]
[6:01] put the song of praise in this.
[6:06] My God
[6:09] [Music]
[6:13] would
[6:15] [Applause]
[6:17] still
[6:22] [Music]
[6:29] hallelujah. Maybe as we stand together,
[6:31] we are standing on holy ground.
[6:34] Just before we change the order of the
[6:36] service, we have several prayer requests
[6:38] to pray over this morning.
[6:41] The Lord Jesus, we need him on the
[6:44] scene.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:46] We are standing
[6:51] [Applause]
[6:53] on holy
[6:55] ground.
[6:56] [Music]
[7:07] all around.
[7:10] [Music]
[7:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, let us praise
[7:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[7:20] now.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus now
[7:24] we are singing.
[7:28] in his presence on holy
[7:32] ground.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; Maybe you just want to lift your hand to
[7:35] him this morning. We are standing.
[7:40] We confess it Lord on holy
[7:44] ground.
[7:47] [Music]
[7:54] Angels all around.
[8:00] Oh, let us praise
[8:07] Jesus.
[8:09] Now
[8:13] we are
[8:15] &gt;&gt; we are standing in God's presence on
[8:19] holy
[8:21] ground.
[8:23] [Music]
[8:26] Amen. It's wonderful to have the saints
[8:28] from Seattle here with us this morning.
[8:30] Brother Peter Ivano, it'd be nice if you
[8:33] could come and open the service in a
[8:34] word of prayer this morning. remember
[8:36] the request we have before us as the
[8:38] deacons come to receive the morning
[8:40] offering.
[8:43] Brother Richard Drake wants us to
[8:44] remember Sister Barb who's homesick this
[8:47] morning. Sister Shana Vanlair is also
[8:50] home sick with a lung infection. Just
[8:52] asking that the Lord would touch her.
[8:54] Sister Sherry Kukon says to pray for my
[8:58] sister Chris who fell early this
[9:00] morning. She's at the hospital now in a
[9:02] lot of pain and can't sit up and the
[9:04] doctors are trying to determine exactly
[9:06] what is wrong. I think there was a a
[9:08] falling spirit going around this
[9:10] morning. I nearly took a dive down the
[9:12] stairs myself and came to church and my
[9:15] wife texted me as soon as I got here and
[9:17] she said, "Don't make a big prayer
[9:18] request, but if you got to expose the
[9:20] devil if he's there." My daughter Lily
[9:23] fell down the same stairs and hurt
[9:24] herself this morning. So, they're at the
[9:26] hospital. So, maybe they're there to
[9:28] minister to somebody. We don't know the
[9:30] Lord needs. So just ask that his hand of
[9:33] mercy would be upon them.
[9:36] If you have a need upon your heart, we
[9:38] want the devil to be defeated today.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit
[9:44] has a great mind and he knows exactly
[9:46] how to defeat the devil. And we just
[9:48] want to confess, Lord, you know the
[9:50] need.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; You know where the weaknesses are. You
[9:53] know where the frailties are. Help us
[9:55] Lord, brother Peter, to come this
[9:57] morning.
[10:06] Our dear Lord Jesus,
[10:08] Father, we come before you this morning.
[10:11] We're so thankful to you because we know
[10:14] that you are a true and living God.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; We know that you're still the same
[10:17] yesterday, today, and forever, Lord God.
[10:20] Father, you know all of our needs.
[10:22] Father, you know our petitions. You know
[10:24] our desires. You know our prayers, Lord
[10:26] God. You know the cry of our heart, Lord
[10:28] Jesus. Father, we're so thankful to you
[10:31] that you are alive tonight, Lord Jesus.
[10:33] Lord God, you're not in the grave.
[10:35] You're not just a God of history, Lord.
[10:37] But you're the same yesterday, today,
[10:39] and forever, Lord Jesus. And that is our
[10:40] hope. That is our faith. That is what
[10:42] we're standing upon this morning, Lord
[10:44] God. Every morning, every day that we
[10:46] get up, Lord Jesus, we know that you are
[10:48] with us, Lord, because you said and
[10:50] you've promised in your word. Lord
[10:52] Jesus, there is none like you, Father.
[10:53] We just want to adore you and give you
[10:55] praise and thanksgiving, Father, for
[10:57] everything that you do for us, Lord God,
[10:59] for how much you care for us, Lord,
[11:01] because you said, "I will not leave you,
[11:02] Lord." And we hold on to that promise,
[11:04] Lord Jesus. Lord God, and we pray that
[11:06] you would come this morning, Father.
[11:08] Minister to every need, Lord Jesus.
[11:10] Minister to every heart, Lord God. Speak
[11:13] to each and every one of us, Lord God,
[11:14] from the youngest to the oldest, Lord
[11:16] Jesus. May your word go forth tonight,
[11:18] Lord God. You're still the same God. You
[11:21] can speak by the power of your word,
[11:22] Lord Jesus. You can transform lives. You
[11:25] can transform thoughts. You can
[11:27] transform ideas and desires, Lord God.
[11:29] Any plan, Lord God, you could, Lord
[11:32] Jesus, redirected, Lord God, the way you
[11:34] want it to be, Father. Father, we stand
[11:36] before you. We ask you, Lord, Lord
[11:38] Jesus, that you will have preeminence
[11:40] amongst us this morning, Lord. May the
[11:42] word, Lord Jesus, have preeminence in
[11:44] every heart and every soul, Lord Jesus.
[11:46] Father, as I was just reading this
[11:48] morning, Father, your prophet said that
[11:50] you are able to change the nature of the
[11:52] spirit, Father, which is the soul, Lord
[11:55] God. And that's what we're desiring,
[11:57] Lord Jesus, that you'd come, Father, and
[11:59] change the nature of the spirit, Lord
[12:01] God, from a worldly, Lord Jesus, to to a
[12:04] heavenly father. May we, Lord Jesus, be
[12:06] more like you, Lord God. May we not
[12:08] leave this place the same as we came in
[12:11] this morning, but may you minister to
[12:13] every heart and soul, Lord. We pray for
[12:15] these needs this morning, Father, for
[12:17] Sister Barb and Sister Shana, Lord
[12:19] Jesus. And Lord God, for Sister Coupons,
[12:24] Lord Jesus. Father, you know these
[12:26] needs, Father. You know, Lord God, every
[12:28] one of us, Lord God, and we ask that you
[12:31] would minister, Father, and go to those
[12:33] to those places, Lord Jesus, and answer
[12:35] those prayers, Father. Heal the sick,
[12:38] Lord God. Deliver those that are bound,
[12:40] Lord Jesus. We believe that you're still
[12:42] the same God, Lord, and you're able to
[12:44] do those things, Father. We don't we
[12:46] don't just come here just because, Lord,
[12:48] but we believe you're still the same
[12:50] powerful God, and you're able to do
[12:52] those things, Father. We pray that you
[12:54] bless each and every one of us, Lord
[12:56] God. May we give back unto you this
[12:57] morning and our offerings, Lord Jesus,
[13:00] in our lives. We lay everything down at
[13:01] your feet. May you speak to us. May you
[13:04] minister through our pastor, Lord Jesus.
[13:06] And may you be glorified in every life,
[13:08] and every home, Lord Jesus. We love you.
[13:10] We commit everything to your hands. In
[13:12] the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[13:14] Christ, we ask all of these things.
[13:16] Amen.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints, as you have your
[13:20] seats this morning.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. God has been so good to us.

[13:58] prayers, the Aello family. Amen. So we

[21:08] to be in the house of God this morning
[21:11] we have uh also a few more
[21:14] uh announcements that need to be made.
[21:16] Uh one we like to remember in particular
[21:18] right now, Brother Murphy and Sister
[21:20] Tracy are in Louisiana
[21:22] and I tried to hook on before coming to
[21:25] church and just as brother Murphy was
[21:28] coming to the pulpit, it all froze up.
[21:31] But uh I'm sure he'll be a tremendous
[21:34] blessing to the saints in Louisiana.
[21:36] Louisiana camp, youth camp is coming.
[21:38] Believe Brother Kim is heading down. and
[21:41] Sister Heddy, are you going to? Yes. And
[21:44] uh some of the young people from the
[21:46] school, they'll be going down this week,
[21:48] so we must remember them. And and uh
[21:51] that will be wonderful. Brother Biscll,
[21:54] brother Timman Puit, Brother Donnie
[21:57] Reagan, and uh Brother Ron Spencer will
[22:00] be speaking in Switzerland. That will be
[22:02] a tremendous time. We need to remember
[22:04] them in this Easter week. You never
[22:07] know, saints of God, this could be the
[22:09] final final curtain.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; Let's all go up. Let's all get caught
[22:14] away.
[22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the hour we're living for
[22:18] and living in. And I know there's a
[22:20] couple that's dying for another
[22:22] announcement to be made. They're on the
[22:24] edge of their seats. Families are
[22:27] sitting there. And I think there's a
[22:29] picture that's going to go up here.
[22:32] Johannes, brother Johannes and sister
[22:36] Hana Hannah Schumacher, Jonas's mother
[22:41] and father. Jonas, why don't you stand?
[22:42] We know who you are. He wasn't welcomed
[22:45] when he came because I said he's been
[22:46] here so often. We keep welcoming him.
[22:49] So, Brother Jonas and brother uh Jerry
[22:54] and sister Dana Robinson would like to
[22:57] announce the engagement.
[22:59] Brother Jonas, Sister Hopy, why don't
[23:01] you stand
[23:04] and why don't we congratulate
[23:06] [Music]
[23:13] Amen.
[23:16] Amen. A wonderful young couple had the
[23:18] privilege to spend some time missed last
[23:20] night. I'm sure they had a wonderful
[23:22] occasion. But the wonderful thing is you
[23:25] just have to rest in the fact that you
[23:27] know sisters might wonder well who's my
[23:29] husband or brothers might wonder who's
[23:31] my wife. Don't you worry God has a way
[23:33] of bringing them from Germany to Canada.
[23:37] And we're happy for you. God bless you.
[23:40] And may God just guide you in the days
[23:42] and weeks ahead as we invite brother
[23:45] Biscll to come and minister the word of
[23:47] God. our dear precious pastor that God
[23:51] will anoint him, strengthen him, and use
[23:52] him in a mighty way. And then those that
[23:55] are visiting and have come all the way
[23:57] from Seattle, God bless you. Whether
[23:59] some are here from Victoria, I don't
[24:00] know, but we'll have a wonderful time
[24:03] today, this morning, and around the
[24:05] communion table. I'm amazed that he
[24:08] loves me.

[27:15] to me.

[27:24] Yes, Lord.
[27:26] Knowing you are everything I'll ever
[27:31] need.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm amazed.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Isn't this grace amazing, friends?
[27:42] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm
[27:45] [Music]
[27:49] through your preious
[27:52] blood. I found you
[27:56] and my sins
[27:59] are washed away. All wash away. All my
[28:05] sins
[28:07] are washed away.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; Let's sing it like this. Oh, I believe
[28:14] &gt;&gt; I
[28:16] love
[28:17] &gt;&gt; that you love me.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; I believe. Yes, I believe
[28:24] your hand
[28:27] to your
[28:30] heart
[28:34] and my sins
[28:37] are
[28:39] all washed away. All my sins
[28:44] are wash away.
[28:53] God bless you.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Another wonderful day.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; Grand announcements.
[29:02] We're praying for brother Murphy.
[29:04] It's nice to see you once again, brother
[29:08] Johannes.
[29:10] and uh to hear the announcement of
[29:14] uh the engagement and and future plans
[29:17] for brother Johannes and sister Hopi.
[29:20] God bless you.
[29:24] We want to uh thank also the
[29:28] uh
[29:30] the song I was expecting a song in
[29:32] Filipino and it was in English.
[29:36] But I'm glad it was in English because
[29:38] the words meant a great deal to me.
[29:42] And uh saying, you know, the fire of
[29:47] God's devotion. That was so fitting to
[29:50] the service this morning. The fire of
[29:53] God's devotion. So, we want something
[29:56] special from God. Then this afternoon,
[29:59] we'll be having the Lord's this evening,
[30:01] the Lord's communion.
[30:04] And we want
[30:07] each one of us to have the testimony
[30:09] that all who come behind us may find us
[30:12] faithful.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Whoever they may be, if there are more
[30:16] that are coming behind us, may they find
[30:18] us faithful.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; Indeed.
[30:21] We I want to just go to the word in a in
[30:24] a moment. So, can we have a word of
[30:25] prayer, please?
[30:28] Dear heavenly father, we've already
[30:30] prayed and our brother Peter
[30:34] uh prayed. I I I pray you'll bless
[30:37] brother Peter Ivanko and the group from
[30:41] Reon and Seattle that have come to join
[30:44] us for the communion. And we think of
[30:47] those from Victoria that may be here,
[30:50] the island. And uh we know it's been
[30:54] difficult because of the island and the
[30:56] fairies at this time so loaded. But we
[31:00] pray, oh God, you'll bless the gathering
[31:02] of the people.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; We have gathered to honor you.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; This is the Lord's day and it's a great
[31:09] day for us. We thank you for last Sunday
[31:12] and the services, Lord, and our brother
[31:15] Tom and brother John that ministered the
[31:18] word to us and our brother Tim uh Dodd
[31:22] up at uh Grand Prairie, Lord, last week
[31:25] and now back. We thank you for the
[31:28] report of the saints of God
[31:31] &gt;&gt; and those that are gathering and have
[31:33] gathered in Switzerland. And I pray,
[31:35] Father, that your holy sacred presence
[31:39] will be upon the meetings
[31:41] &gt;&gt; and upon the people that gather. You
[31:44] will hold them in your grip, oh God, and
[31:47] pray and prevent the enemy from having
[31:50] anything to do with the meetings.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; We pray, oh God, you'll be glorified.
[31:55] And now this morning, especially, we
[31:58] have some things on our heart. I pray,
[32:01] oh God, that you will take human lips
[32:04] &gt;&gt; and speak the thoughts that come from
[32:08] the throne of God. We're not interested
[32:10] in any other thoughts. We're not
[32:12] interested in human opinion. We're
[32:15] interested in what God has said.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; And what you have conffirmed and
[32:20] vindicated, oh God. Thank you for the
[32:22] cross.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus, for the shedding
[32:26] of the blood. Thank you for that great
[32:28] sacrifice that no one else could ever
[32:31] pay. And we can say we've been redeemed
[32:34] by blood divine. Thank you, Father. In
[32:37] the name of Jesus Christ, we commit
[32:40] ourselves to you now. Thy will be done
[32:43] on earth as it is in heaven.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll have you while you're
[32:49] standing turn in your Bibles if you
[32:51] would please
[32:53] to Genesis the 22nd chapter and we're
[32:57] going to read verses 15 down through 18
[33:01] and then we have a second reading in
[33:03] Deuteronomy 28.
[33:09] So in our first reading Genesis
[33:14] 22,
[33:16] I pray that uh we will stand here today
[33:21] present ourselves
[33:24] to Almighty God. Say thy will be done.
[33:30] Don't let it be just another service for
[33:33] you. Say impact my life. Amen.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm praying.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; All right, we'll start with the 22nd
[33:43] chapter, verse 15. And the angel of the
[33:46] Lord called unto Abraham, this is when
[33:49] he took his son Isaac up to be offered.
[33:54] called to Abraham out of heaven
[33:57] and the second time
[34:01] and said, "By myself have I sworn,
[34:05] sayeth the Lord.
[34:07] For because thou hast done this thing,
[34:11] and hast not withheld thy son, thine
[34:15] only son,
[34:17] that in blessing I will bless thee, and
[34:20] in multiplying I will multiply thy seed
[34:23] as the stars of the heaven, and as the
[34:27] sand which is upon the seashore,
[34:30] and the seed, and thy seed shall possess
[34:33] the gate of the enemies. You'll notice
[34:36] in the verse before which we just read
[34:38] said, "Thy son, thy only son." He had
[34:41] Ishmael.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; So it just pays to recognize that God
[34:47] has a way of counting that's not our way
[34:50] of counting.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; The elect are the elect.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Thy seed, thy seed, and thy thy son, thy
[34:59] only son.
[35:01] Uh, nobody knows exactly what may have
[35:03] been in God's mind. But Apostle Paul, he
[35:06] said, notice he said, "Seed, not seeds
[35:10] as in many, but as in one, which is
[35:13] Christ."
[35:15] &gt;&gt; So God's mind is on those things.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; And in thy seed shall all the nations of
[35:22] the earth be blessed because thou hast
[35:24] obeyed my voice. And then down I want to
[35:28] speak upon uh blessings but in a certain
[35:32] from a certain direction but I thought I
[35:34] would like to uh turn to Deuteronomy 28
[35:39] and speak about these blessings. And it
[35:41] shall come to pass starting from verse
[35:43] one.
[35:47] Deuteronomy 28 verse one. And it shall
[35:51] come to pass, if thou shalt hearken
[35:54] diligently unto the voice of the Lord
[35:57] thy God, to observe and to do all his
[36:00] commandments, which I command you this
[36:03] day, that the Lord thy God will set thee
[36:05] on high above all the nations of the
[36:08] earth. And all these blessings shall
[36:11] come on thee, and overtake thee. Isn't
[36:14] that wonderful?
[36:16] If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of
[36:19] the Lord thy God, blessed shalt thou be
[36:22] in the city, and blessed shalt thou be
[36:26] in the field. So whether you're a farmer
[36:28] or a city dweller, blessed shalt thou be
[36:33] shall be the fruit of thy body and the
[36:36] fruit of thy ground and the fruit of thy
[36:39] cattle, the increase of thy kind, and
[36:43] the flocks uh of thy sheep.
[36:47] Blessed shall be thy basket and thy
[36:50] store.
[36:51] Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest
[36:56] in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou
[36:58] goest out. The Lord shall cause thine
[37:02] enemies that rise up against thee to be
[37:07] smitten before thy face. Do you believe
[37:10] that? Amen.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; They shall they shall come out against
[37:15] thee one way and flee before thee seven
[37:18] ways
[37:19] &gt;&gt; and eight if necessary.
[37:21] The Lord shall command thee uh blessing
[37:25] upon thee in thy storehouses and in all
[37:29] of all that thou setest thine hand to
[37:33] unto. And he shall bless thee in the
[37:36] land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
[37:40] The Lord shall establish thee and holy
[37:43] peop a holy people unto himself, and he
[37:47] hath as he hath sworn unto thee, if thou
[37:51] shalt keep the commandments of the Lord
[37:53] thy God, and walk in his ways. And all
[37:57] the people of the earth shall see that
[38:01] thou art called by the name of the Lord,
[38:05] and they shall be afraid of thee. Amen.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; And the Lord shall
[38:13] make thee plenteous in goods, and in the
[38:16] fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of
[38:19] thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy
[38:21] ground, in the land which the Lord swear
[38:25] unto thy fathers to give thee. The Lord
[38:28] shall open upon thee his good treasure,
[38:32] and heaven uh the heaven to give the
[38:36] rain unto thee unto thy land in thy in
[38:40] thy season in his season, and to bless
[38:43] all the work of thine hand, and thou
[38:46] shalt lend unto many nations, and thou
[38:50] shalt not borrow.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; And the Lord, that's amazing, have a
[38:55] nation with no debt.
[39:00] Do I hear? Amen.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; That's better. And the Lord shall make
[39:06] thee the head and not the tail, and thou
[39:10] shalt be above only, and thou shalt not
[39:14] be beneath.
[39:16] If thou if that thou hearken unto the
[39:19] commandments of the Lord thy God, notice
[39:22] how that keeps coming in, which I
[39:24] command thee this day, to observe and to
[39:27] do them. And thou shalt not go aside
[39:31] from any of the words which I command
[39:34] thee this day to the right hand or to
[39:37] the left to go after other gods to serve
[39:40] them.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless his word. You may have
[39:44] your seats.
[39:58] I've got a number of
[40:01] quotes, just a few, but I want I'll just
[40:03] have this one up. Please, we'll dim the
[40:07] lights.
[40:09] No, that's not it. Please.
[40:11] I just want the first one.
[40:14] Every Christian.
[40:22] Every Christian. Do we have some here?
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. I'm sure. Every Christian fights a
[40:29] battle. How often? Every day.
[40:36] I want it to sink in. That's why I'm
[40:37] just waiting. Going slow.
[40:40] We're in a warfare right now going on
[40:44] constantly within us between right and
[40:49] wrong.
[40:51] Shall we receive it? What shall we do?
[40:55] Shall we uh shall we bow to the world?
[40:59] Shall we give up this thought that we
[41:02] got? Shall we give up this thought that
[41:05] we got?
[41:07] And uh I had uh in an appendix
[41:12] out of that same message, victory day.
[41:15] And if we see it, said focus on it.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; If we see it, if you see it, doesn't say
[41:22] everybody got to see it, but if you see
[41:23] it, focus on it. And part of the service
[41:27] this morning is that to help you to see
[41:29] it,
[41:31] &gt;&gt; to see it maybe more clearly,
[41:34] &gt;&gt; see what this is all about.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; And I hope that you agree with it.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; If we see it, focus it. Take it from
[41:46] Genesis to Revelation. Don't just let
[41:48] the preacher do it. You do it.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Take it from Genesis to Revelation. Go
[41:52] home and take the Bible
[41:56] And may perhaps God will speak to you
[41:58] about a certain message or a certain
[42:00] scripture.
[42:02] And she says, "Thus sayaith the Lord
[42:04] each time right down through there. We
[42:07] can't give it up. We can't compromise
[42:10] with the rest of them. We just can't do
[42:13] it. We've got the We've got to stay
[42:16] here. That's all. No matter how great
[42:20] the enemy is and how much machinery he's
[42:23] got against us and how many
[42:25] organizations
[42:27] and how many of this, that, or the
[42:30] other, we just can't compromise.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; That wonderful words.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; I've got a lot more I could say right
[42:39] there, but I just want to go on from
[42:42] there. First,
[42:45] I want to speak on the cause of Christ.
[42:49] Everything has to have a cause. We had a
[42:53] couple remarkable things in this last
[42:56] week.
[42:57] And uh
[43:01] this last week I you know because
[43:04] there's many that are from across the
[43:06] border and many that are here local
[43:09] Canadians. Maybe you don't hear too much
[43:12] about Vimemy Ridge.
[43:15] Vimemy Ridge was a a ridge in France
[43:20] and the French troops were unable to
[43:22] dislodge the German troops in the first
[43:26] world war
[43:28] and they were the it is said that the
[43:31] German troops had spent two years. I
[43:35] have been to vimeie ridge. I and my
[43:38] wife, the people from Netherlands took
[43:40] us there and uh it is it's an amazing
[43:44] fortification.
[43:46] The trenches are not one story.
[43:49] They're they're maybe two or three
[43:52] stories. And they had uh I understand
[43:56] that they had some of the trenches even
[43:59] had not merely kitchens but hospitals
[44:03] and they were prepared to look after the
[44:05] wounded and so on.
[44:07] And they were so well fortified and they
[44:09] had concreted machine gun nests
[44:14] and that's what prevented the British uh
[44:18] not the British but the French from
[44:20] capturing it. And uh that was one of the
[44:24] greatest battles. It was a hundred years
[44:27] 100y year anniversary this last week.
[44:30] And uh there was four divisions of
[44:32] Canadians. Now, we Canada didn't have
[44:35] much of a population back then, but four
[44:37] divisions is I think probably 4,000 or
[44:40] more men and one British division, but
[44:43] there was a total of 170,000
[44:47] men.
[44:48] And the Canadians had conceived a a plan
[44:53] to attack by
[44:56] uh what they called creeping a creeping
[44:58] attack. And they would go a 100 yards
[45:02] and then stop and let the artillery
[45:06] barrage just over their heads and they
[45:08] just blew the ground there. They've left
[45:10] the ground as it was. It was just uh
[45:14] muddy and terrible. and the uh troops
[45:17] that were going over it. In fact is we
[45:20] feel quite close because my wife's
[45:22] father was fighting right beside Vimemy
[45:25] and her uncle was in Vimemy and uh the
[45:31] Canadian uh troops took the ridge in
[45:34] four days
[45:36] by this creeping attack and they would
[45:40] go a 100 yards and stop and sometimes
[45:43] they were just 30 40 yards 30 40 m from
[45:47] the uh German lines and the German
[45:50] trenches. And uh one one young uh
[45:54] Canadian fellow, he came up with a plan
[45:56] or an idea to
[45:59] tunnel under under the right where the
[46:03] machine guns nests were all concreted
[46:06] in. And he I think they blew up about
[46:09] five at once and uh and made way for
[46:13] them to come and they captured it. And
[46:16] so they're there celebrating the 100th
[46:19] anniversary. Now, that was uh that was
[46:23] not it's not just a matter of interest,
[46:25] but these young men, there was 4,000
[46:28] that were killed in those four days.
[46:30] Just under 4,000 that were killed. That
[46:33] was an awful cost,
[46:35] &gt;&gt; but it was a cause.
[46:38] It was a cause. There was a cause to
[46:40] fight, but they didn't have a that's not
[46:42] a cause where they chose to fight. That
[46:46] was a cause where they were drafted or
[46:48] they joined, but they didn't know
[46:51] exactly what they're going to be doing.
[46:52] But the military officers tell them what
[46:56] they're going to do or the military
[46:58] department. But here is uh I thought
[47:02] what is life?
[47:04] What's life all about? People are asking
[47:06] that all kinds of people, young
[47:09] teenagers,
[47:11] married couples. They're saying, "What
[47:13] is life? What do I do? Uh do I work for
[47:17] my life and just drop over some at some
[47:20] point and and uh leave the rest behind?
[47:24] What what what's this all about?" And I
[47:28] this is what I'm I'm preaching. I have a
[47:30] very great burden on my heart.
[47:33] The burden of the word of the Lord is
[47:35] what I'm burdened with. And that is that
[47:40] you didn't come here as they call
[47:42] planned parenthood
[47:45] where the parents actually planned you.
[47:47] It was God that planned you.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says clearly,
[47:53] you've been pre-planned.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Your birth here was pre-planned.
[47:58] And there's one I can tell you there was
[48:00] one being that knew who you were going
[48:03] to be. They knew what color hair you're
[48:07] going to have or color eyes. He knew
[48:10] what country you were going to be born
[48:12] in. He knew absolutely everything. He
[48:14] knew what kind of blend of character and
[48:18] maybe took centuries bringing that down.
[48:22] But then a prophet comes and explains
[48:24] that. says he mixed one with another and
[48:27] another with another and another with
[48:30] another until he got the right ting.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; And that's not the ting you want to
[48:35] hear. That's the thing he wanted to
[48:37] hear.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; And so he put certain qualities and
[48:41] blended certain things together
[48:44] and uh it's really quite an amazing
[48:48] thing.
[48:49] very very amazing that we have been
[48:52] pre-planned
[48:53] and we have a certain purpose. I want to
[48:56] I just want to take my time if you don't
[49:00] mind because because of the brevity of
[49:03] life. Not just the brevity but because
[49:06] of the seriousness of life regardless of
[49:09] what age you are. And I'm looking at
[49:13] some very young faces. But time will
[49:16] slip away from you very quickly. Count
[49:19] on it. And you'll remember these words
[49:22] on down the line. You'll say, "Where did
[49:25] the last 10 years go? Where did the last
[49:28] 10 years that you've lived go?" And
[49:30] that's where the next 10 are going to
[49:32] go.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; And then and and as fast as those went,
[49:35] the next 10's going to go faster.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; It's true, brother Ernie, isn't it? Yes.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; So I think the thing to we need to do as
[49:46] a group of people as a congregation and
[49:48] those of you that are streaming
[49:51] what we need to identify is
[49:54] where are the blessings of God on on
[49:58] what in this life? There's no nation I
[50:01] know that has the blessings. There is no
[50:06] there's no country. There's no there's
[50:08] no church I know that actually can say
[50:13] and boldly declare we have the blessing,
[50:16] &gt;&gt; we have the source. No, it's just the
[50:19] mercy and grace of God.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; And God is dealing with individuals
[50:25] &gt;&gt; and we're a group of individuals. And
[50:27] there'll be some here that will gain
[50:30] more from this service than others. But
[50:32] I pray for everyone and I have been
[50:35] pondering very very deeply throughout
[50:37] this week, not one week, more than one
[50:41] week. And I want you all to listen very
[50:43] very closely.
[50:46] I may say some things that you agree
[50:48] with. I trust I will and some things you
[50:52] may disagree with and that'll be fine.
[50:56] I'll pray for you.
[51:00] So we want to identify what is blessed.
[51:04] And this is what God said in Genesis 22
[51:06] and1
[51:09] that in blessing I will bless thee.
[51:12] Speaking to Abraham
[51:15] and in multiplying I will multiply thy
[51:18] seed as the stars of the heaven and as
[51:22] the sand which is upon the seashore.
[51:25] and thy seed shall possess the gate of
[51:27] the enemy. And then in Galatians, Paul
[51:31] picks that up and Paul says, "Now to
[51:35] Abraham and his seed were the promises
[51:38] made, he sth not, and to seeds plural,
[51:45] &gt;&gt; as to many, but as of one, and thy seed,
[51:50] which is Christ." Amen.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; And we know without me having to go into
[51:56] a whole lot of uh detail that Christ is
[52:00] this word of God living
[52:03] &gt;&gt; and manifested.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; And we know that there's a portion for
[52:08] each time and each season.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; It's not all just that's when when Jesus
[52:15] came. The record of Jesus is here. And I
[52:19] don't really want to do it with this
[52:21] Bible because it's kind of coming apart.
[52:24] But
[52:27] it does have its effect.
[52:33] These two pages here separate the Old
[52:37] from the New Testament.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; And the New Testament is actually just a
[52:43] a portion. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
[52:46] John.
[52:48] They record the life of Jesus Christ.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; The book of Acts records what happened
[52:55] to people like you and me when the
[52:58] spirit of Jesus Christ after his
[53:01] resurrection came into them.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; And then they begin to act and do
[53:08] what he did. And what what what was left
[53:12] in the word of God that was not
[53:15] completed yet. And and the messenger we
[53:19] speak about the messenger prophet
[53:21] messenger in this time. He was chosen of
[53:25] God and the proof of that is his
[53:28] ministry. But he was chosen of God for a
[53:32] a certain allotment of scripture which
[53:35] was not completed and not fulfilled
[53:39] which a people would fulfill. I mean if
[53:42] you say well it's all done if it's what
[53:44] are you doing here?
[53:46] &gt;&gt; What am I doing here if it's all done?
[53:48] No, there's a part for us to fill. Fill.
[53:51] You are written in this scripture.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; And the prophet comes to identify that
[53:57] scripture and say, "Wow,
[54:00] something's left. It's and it's for
[54:03] you." And and and the emphasis is on now
[54:07] the people are coming out and but now
[54:11] this is called a bride.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; And this is a bride for him.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; He was the husband. He was the man and
[54:19] and out of the scriptures coming the
[54:22] woman, the wife and this the bride is
[54:25] going to come out. And so there's an
[54:27] aotment for yourself as well. And that
[54:30] is why
[54:33] uh that scripture and the word of God
[54:37] alone bears
[54:39] the blessings of God.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Because and brother Brandham says it
[54:44] very clearly. He said, "It may sound
[54:47] unreasonable.
[54:48] It may look impossible.
[54:51] It may look as though there's no way
[54:53] it's going to happen." He said, "It is
[54:55] going to happen because God said it was
[54:58] going to happen."
[54:59] &gt;&gt; He's not depending upon circumstances or
[55:03] or you know manipulating things and and
[55:07] arranging so that it can happen. It will
[55:10] happen simply because he said it has
[55:12] going to happen.
[55:14] And it's important for us today to say
[55:18] it's it's going to happen. Whatever the
[55:21] prophet of God has spoken, I I put my
[55:24] confidence there because that's
[55:28] that's the one or that's the ministry
[55:32] that God has confirmed. And when he
[55:35] confirms it from some supernatural realm
[55:37] and if you and if you have any question
[55:40] about that you may vi visit her here or
[55:42] there may be somebody listening on the
[55:44] internet for the first time. You need to
[55:47] take enough it's your life.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; It's your it's your future. You need to
[55:53] take enough time. Maybe you studied for
[55:56] many years in school or advanced
[55:59] education to get where you're at. and
[56:02] and and a lot of people have spent 12,
[56:04] 13, 14, 15 years. You need to spend a
[56:07] few weeks at least to go from Genesis to
[56:11] Revelation and find out and first listen
[56:15] to the messenger. Listen to I do it
[56:18] myself. I've did it several times this
[56:21] week and the last few days. I always go
[56:24] to the end of the service because I when
[56:27] I hear or I'm reading a message book, I
[56:30] go to the end quickly and because some
[56:33] of the things that are spoken, I say
[56:36] that is really stiff. That is really
[56:38] straight. But now I want to come to the
[56:41] end to see what God did.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; And you see God confirming it
[56:46] &gt;&gt; and and God taking a vessel. And a few
[56:49] moments ago, this vessel speaks
[56:52] something that maybe you never saw
[56:54] before or you have a hard time
[56:56] accepting. But then you come into the
[56:58] end and you find God speaking
[57:01] &gt;&gt; and a man saying I'm not in this world.
[57:03] You may be hearing my voice. That's not
[57:06] me speaking. That's him. Where did it
[57:08] come from? If this is a word that God
[57:11] has blessed, then it was in the mind of
[57:13] God eternally. And then I say to this
[57:16] congregation and all other
[57:18] congregations, we better take heed to
[57:21] it.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; We better listen to it.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; We better say that uh whatever I have
[57:28] learned or whatever I have studied that
[57:32] that's meaningless.
[57:34] Whatever I think,
[57:35] &gt;&gt; who cares what you think?
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Who cares what I think? All kinds of
[57:40] smarter people than us have come up
[57:42] before. But what and it's not our
[57:45] opinion. It's not what we not what
[57:48] appeals to us, but it's what God has
[57:51] said.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Let's find out what he said. You need to
[57:54] take the time to discover what God
[57:57] confirmed
[57:58] &gt;&gt; and then say that's truth.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; And I said all of this to say that's
[58:04] what we need to identify.
[58:08] We need to identify where the blessing
[58:11] is.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Because God said, "I will bless thee
[58:19] and I will bless your seed."
[58:22] And I went to the chapter Deuteronomy
[58:24] 28. So we can just describe the
[58:26] blessing.
[58:28] Let me say this to you as a friend, as a
[58:31] brother in Christ. And if you wish to
[58:34] think of pastor, that's fine, or
[58:36] whatever. I'm so thankful for the
[58:38] ministry that we have here. So thankful
[58:41] for what God has done. Thankful that God
[58:44] has drawn you some way. Somehow he's
[58:48] drawn you and given you an interest and
[58:51] and and sparked a curiosity. Now you're
[58:54] going to satisfy that curiosity
[58:57] because
[59:00] what I have here today, I think will
[59:02] spark some interest for you.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; We got to have a commitment.
[59:09] A few days ago,
[59:11] President Trump, whatever you think
[59:13] about President Trump, I think he
[59:16] probably did a good thing, but he sent
[59:19] uh 59 Tommy Hawk missiles
[59:23] into Syria. While the Canadians are
[59:26] celebrating what they did a 100 years
[59:28] ago, here's a president
[59:31] uh sending missiles into a country and
[59:35] uh on a certain airfield
[59:38] because the president of that company,
[59:40] that country
[59:42] gassed his people
[59:45] and and when the president they said on
[59:47] the news, in fact his newscasters that
[59:51] have been very very in the media which
[59:53] has been very negative and very I think
[59:58] unkind
[1:00:00] to Mr. Trump without listening, without
[1:00:03] hearing first or seeing what he's going
[1:00:05] to do. And we may not agree with what he
[1:00:08] he's doing or what he promised to do or
[1:00:10] whatever more. Uh but nevertheless, he
[1:00:13] really silenced these people,
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Uh they don't know what to think now.
[1:00:19] And he took it to took it to task and
[1:00:22] said he said these words. He said these
[1:00:26] people that were gassed and he saysnone
[1:00:28] of God's children need to suffer like
[1:00:32] that.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; And to that I could say correct.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. And that was a brutal
[1:00:39] thing to do and he felt something needed
[1:00:43] to be done. And uh so whether that stops
[1:00:47] it or not, that's beside the point. But
[1:00:50] the thing is he caught the attention of
[1:00:52] the world.
[1:00:53] And he felt that that was a sufficient
[1:00:56] cause
[1:00:58] to do something and to send a signal
[1:01:02] maybe to North Korea or
[1:01:05] to Iran or some of the other nations
[1:01:09] that are fully run. And now you have a
[1:01:11] prophet. I'm going to be reading some
[1:01:13] things. I hope you don't weary. If
[1:01:15] you're weary, just stand up and shake
[1:01:16] yourself cuz I don't I don't speak that
[1:01:19] often anymore.
[1:01:22] But I can tell you what, you young
[1:01:24] people that are here, you could I I'm
[1:01:27] going I'm going to say some things in
[1:01:29] just a few moments. I'm going to lay a
[1:01:31] challenge out to you
[1:01:34] because I can tell you that you you can
[1:01:37] be just like you are now. get out in
[1:01:39] your nice shiny car and go to a
[1:01:41] restaurant and all the rest of it, but
[1:01:43] by tomorrow morning,
[1:01:45] there could be all kinds of devastation
[1:01:47] taking place. There's been people just
[1:01:50] like us before living the easy life,
[1:01:55] enjoying the benefits of life, enjoying
[1:01:58] families, and in a few moments. in a few
[1:02:01] moments.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; It may not be Europe. It may be here
[1:02:09] next time. And and small countries. And
[1:02:12] brother Brandham says some small
[1:02:15] country.
[1:02:17] A small country. Just some wild guy. And
[1:02:21] this this kind this civilization isn't
[1:02:24] short on wild guys.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; We live in a very unstable world. Right.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; And I see you're agreeing. You young
[1:02:34] people need to. I may not see it and we
[1:02:38] may not see it. And you say, "Well, we
[1:02:40] have a prophet says I won't drop a bomb
[1:02:42] before the bridal be gone." But he also
[1:02:44] talks about a squeeze. He talks about
[1:02:47] things.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; He talks about hardships.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; And so that's what I am going to be
[1:02:54] speaking about.
[1:03:08] Brother Brandham talked about another
[1:03:11] group of people
[1:03:14] and uh this is a little bit difficult
[1:03:16] for me
[1:03:20] but we have what is called the Holocaust
[1:03:23] and everyone knows about the Holocaust.
[1:03:26] Now those those people
[1:03:30] they didn't perhaps realize
[1:03:34] uh that they were written in the word of
[1:03:36] God.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; This word of God
[1:03:41] that actually is the only thing that's
[1:03:43] blessed.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; And we don't understand blessings. We
[1:03:49] think well blessings is having enough
[1:03:51] food and having a better job and all of
[1:03:54] these things. No. The blessings
[1:03:58] that you have, if there's blessings on
[1:04:01] your life, it's because your name was
[1:04:04] put in the lamb's book of life
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; And so I'm going to
[1:04:15] You can dim the lights please for me one
[1:04:17] moment.
[1:04:22] No home in Germany.
[1:04:25] Everything taken away from them.
[1:04:28] Everything.
[1:04:30] I'm talking about combs.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Combs. So they couldn't comb their hair.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the hair from the
[1:04:39] women. You got Don't ever complain about
[1:04:42] your long hair. I've seen mountains of
[1:04:44] it
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; where they just cut off their hair.
[1:04:50] and dehumanize them. I'm talking about
[1:04:54] I'm talking about doctors.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about school teachers. I'm
[1:04:59] talking about young people. I'm talking
[1:05:01] about children.
[1:05:06] And it says
[1:05:08] he said
[1:05:11] also in Italy
[1:05:13] and Russia
[1:05:16] and no place to go
[1:05:19] and they uh they were sent back to their
[1:05:23] homeland
[1:05:25] just to fulfill the word of God.
[1:05:29] I wonder if the people could say
[1:05:33] together, just to fulfill the word of
[1:05:36] God. Shall we say it, please? Just to
[1:05:40] fulfill the word of God. Once more. Just
[1:05:44] to fulfill the word of God. No place. No
[1:05:49] place to call home. Just to fulfill the
[1:05:52] word of God. Driven from this country,
[1:05:55] unwelcome.
[1:05:58] and many times still unwelcome just to
[1:06:01] fulfill the word of God. The blessed
[1:06:04] word of God.
[1:06:06] The word of God that is that I by myself
[1:06:10] have sworn. God said
[1:06:14] and I can tell you this message, these
[1:06:17] people that got problem with this
[1:06:19] message, they got a problem with God.
[1:06:23] Hallelujah.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; It's that the message doesn't unfold the
[1:06:28] way many think.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; And I want to dislodge any thoughts in
[1:06:33] your mind that has to happen the way I
[1:06:36] think it's going to happen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen that way.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; And we are anticipating a rapture. And I
[1:06:44] can tell you it just uh you know it's
[1:06:47] not going to be just a easy woozy thing
[1:06:50] that we just uh keep floating on. I'll
[1:06:52] just go to church and get ready and hear
[1:06:54] some exciting things and get ready for
[1:06:57] the rapture. What is the rapture?
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; H how does it happen?
[1:07:03] Uh h how are these things to take place?
[1:07:06] What are you expecting?
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; See those are why why do I ask that?
[1:07:12] Because I think that I I think about
[1:07:14] that. I ask about that and I know that
[1:07:16] the prophet of God,
[1:07:19] he speaks of it sometimes that you that
[1:07:21] you come to a place of faith and he
[1:07:24] talked about faith and tied faith to the
[1:07:26] rapture. So sometimes we don't have
[1:07:28] enough faith for healing. And what about
[1:07:31] faith for the rapture? Oh well, there's
[1:07:35] maybe perhaps something. And then faith
[1:07:37] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:07:40] word of God. And I don't want to uh make
[1:07:43] it difficult for you sitting here
[1:07:45] listening those on the internet and
[1:07:47] whatever more. What do you know about
[1:07:49] the word of God? What do we know about
[1:07:51] the message? uh when when have we
[1:07:55] absorbed it and pondered it and and uh
[1:07:59] you know I I don't want to present
[1:08:00] myself as being anything but this last
[1:08:02] week I just pondered as I read uh a
[1:08:06] quote and another one and and and as I
[1:08:10] pondered
[1:08:12] who it was and who's speaking and some
[1:08:17] quotes I'll come what world he was in he
[1:08:19] said I'm in another world I thought what
[1:08:22] world is that?
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; And then he said when you get there and
[1:08:27] in that world and he said when you come
[1:08:30] back out of the vision you have the word
[1:08:32] of God. I thought that's the go that's
[1:08:35] the word that's blessed
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; our this blessing that come from God
[1:08:39] come from another world. It's not a
[1:08:42] blessing of this world. It's from
[1:08:44] another world. It's not from a world of
[1:08:47] time. It's from a world of eternity.
[1:08:50] It's something foreign to us. We have
[1:08:52] beginnings and endings. The start of the
[1:08:54] day, the end of the day, beginning of a
[1:08:56] job, the end of a job, starting a
[1:08:58] school, the ending of school. Eternity
[1:09:00] doesn't know anything about that. You've
[1:09:03] got to get out of that out of that
[1:09:05] place. Oh, it all begins. It all ends.
[1:09:08] Now we're getting married. Now we now we
[1:09:10] have a life and then we have a death.
[1:09:13] It's not that. This is an eternal God.
[1:09:15] and he picks up a one one person and he
[1:09:19] start to generate his word through it
[1:09:21] and and and he hardly knows where he's
[1:09:24] at and and he doesn't know it. He's
[1:09:27] looking around to see if he's in in this
[1:09:29] world. He's not that's not for him.
[1:09:32] That's for you.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; That's for us.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Has to alert alert us where we are.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; He says a dark world. I'm not preaching
[1:09:44] a negative message. If I can get you on
[1:09:47] this side into how God has been dealing
[1:09:51] and I I I will read a
[1:09:54] read a quote and read it and my wife
[1:09:58] came into the room and scared me
[1:10:00] actually into the study cuz I was so
[1:10:03] deep in
[1:10:05] and being affected by what was taking
[1:10:08] place. I thought, well, if I read this,
[1:10:11] it's so simple.
[1:10:13] So simple. But yet I can tell you that
[1:10:16] the spirit of God comes moving out of
[1:10:20] that realm. I it didn't make any
[1:10:22] difference that I was sitting in my
[1:10:24] study or or the messages 30, 40, 50, 60
[1:10:28] years ago. God knows nothing about that
[1:10:31] 60 years. He's the eternal one. And he
[1:10:35] sees a son or sees a man or whoever he
[1:10:38] is. I don't feel anything special, but
[1:10:40] I'm sitting there and I'm absorbing and
[1:10:43] seeking to hear and seeking to make
[1:10:46] contact with that God. And before a few
[1:10:50] moments passes, I find myself weeping.
[1:10:53] Oh, I'm so moved. I'm so moved at this
[1:10:57] presence. Oh, and then I understand. I
[1:11:01] know why. He said, "Isn't he lovely?"
[1:11:03] And I begin to say that so many times.
[1:11:06] You are lovely, Lord. Oh, you're so
[1:11:09] lovely. You're so wonderful. This whole
[1:11:12] atmosphere is so glorious. It puts you
[1:11:14] out of this world and out of this life
[1:11:17] and into another place.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:22] [Applause]
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh God, help me.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Help me to convey this.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Help me to convey this. Not the thought,
[1:11:32] not the quote,
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; but this atmosphere. Help me to convey
[1:11:36] this
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; how you're are feeling and what you have
[1:11:40] said and what you think about things.
[1:11:42] Yes sir.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; So he said just to fulfill the word of
[1:11:49] God. Oh the loving hand of God.
[1:11:54] how sometimes it looks cruel the way
[1:11:58] that people suffer, but it still it's
[1:12:02] the tender hand of Jehovah
[1:12:05] leading his little children. We thank
[1:12:08] you, Lord. And I thought very deeply
[1:12:11] about this. And some of you, you that
[1:12:15] are here that are school teachers,
[1:12:18] you are that are parents,
[1:12:22] you may not agree with this, but
[1:12:26] my wife has difficulty,
[1:12:29] and I don't blame her at seeing the
[1:12:31] pictures of the Holocaust.
[1:12:35] And I would challenge anyone who thinks
[1:12:38] that they're able
[1:12:40] to look at the pictures of stacks of
[1:12:43] bodies of the Holocaust. You think,
[1:12:46] "Well, that's just too terrible." It is.
[1:12:49] It is very terrible.
[1:12:51] But I I challenge you to look at it and
[1:12:53] say, "Tender hand of Jehovah."
[1:13:00] That doesn't agree with your mind.
[1:13:03] That doesn't agree with the 20th 1st
[1:13:05] century thinking.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; That doesn't agree with Canadian or
[1:13:10] European or American life,
[1:13:13] but that agrees with what God said to
[1:13:16] fulfill the word of God. So, what kind
[1:13:19] of a God are you teaching? I don't know,
[1:13:23] but it's a God of the word. Amen.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with and he he uses
[1:13:32] whom he uses.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; He uses wicked men.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; He uses vile, dark, wicked men.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; But they fulfill his purpose.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about God. If we could get a
[1:13:46] understanding, if we could get a real
[1:13:49] revelation of who this God is.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; And what he has blessed, he's blessed.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do. He's not going to
[1:13:58] ask anybody, "Can I bless it or can I
[1:14:01] bless them?" He doesn't care what people
[1:14:03] think about William Brandham or Martin
[1:14:05] Luther or anybody. He doesn't care what
[1:14:08] they think about them. He raises them
[1:14:10] up. They do what they're supposed to do.
[1:14:12] They go off the scene. that and that
[1:14:15] that's that's his doing. And then we
[1:14:17] could just say God is God.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; That's my God.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; That's the one who conceived redemption.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; He saved me.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; And he's the only one that has the
[1:14:31] capacity to forget, to wash from his
[1:14:35] memory. We don't have that capacity, it
[1:14:38] seems. But and we let Satan get in there
[1:14:41] and use our memories like a playground.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; And all of you you people that have
[1:14:47] failures,
[1:14:49] we all have failures.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; We all have miserable failures.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; And and and we we can't re we can't wash
[1:14:58] from our memory, but he can.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; He can literally wash from his memory.
[1:15:04] Why? Because he's God.
[1:15:07] Hallelujah.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; I'm going to just read this. Did you
[1:15:14] know that the Greek word holocaust
[1:15:21] means burnt whole?
[1:15:26] For the early Jews who followed the laws
[1:15:30] given in the first books of the Bible,
[1:15:33] a holocaust was a sacrifice to God. The
[1:15:38] burning on an altar of a lamb, goat, or
[1:15:42] young bull. The word is used about 200
[1:15:47] times in the traditional Greek version
[1:15:50] of the Old Testament,
[1:15:53] though it rarely appears in English
[1:15:56] translations.
[1:15:58] In the 1700s,
[1:16:01] Holocaust began to be, and I'm not
[1:16:03] speaking about the Holocaust, but it's a
[1:16:06] reality.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:11] 1700s began to be used to refer to the
[1:16:16] mass destruction of life. But no mass
[1:16:20] murder in western history ever
[1:16:23] approached this scale achieved by the
[1:16:26] Nazis. And incidentally that was a
[1:16:30] political political group. As many as 6
[1:16:34] million Jews may have died
[1:16:40] at their hands.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:16:43] now I'm making I'm moving slowly. Is
[1:16:46] that all right?
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; You honor a Jew and God will honor you.
[1:16:56] Now, there's a bunch of Jews that's
[1:16:58] renegade
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; just like there's Gentiles the same way,
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; but the real Jew, God's put his name on
[1:17:08] the book before the foundation of the
[1:17:11] world.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; And here, here he was murdered down in
[1:17:16] this time. And remember, think of it
[1:17:20] now, how perfect this is. Right after
[1:17:23] them, millions of slaughtered Jews,
[1:17:26] innocent people by the nations of the
[1:17:30] world. Here the scripture says right in
[1:17:33] this time that there
[1:17:37] each one under the altar
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; realized what has happened and they are
[1:17:45] given white robes. Here's my second
[1:17:48] challenge to you.
[1:17:51] You look at those
[1:17:54] very vivid photographs
[1:18:00] and say given white robes.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; They didn't know it.
[1:18:10] There's not there's not a preacher
[1:18:12] living
[1:18:14] or that is in history that have used
[1:18:17] these words.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to say something. Your
[1:18:21] prophet used them.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; You can't look at those pictures and say
[1:18:28] tender hand of Jehovah.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; You've got to eliminate what's in your
[1:18:35] mind. You've got to dismiss what's in
[1:18:37] your mind. And I'm going to read a
[1:18:39] scripture. I'm going to read a a
[1:18:41] paragraph where he said in prayer, "Help
[1:18:45] me to dismiss
[1:18:47] my thoughts and dismiss
[1:18:50] my life."
[1:18:54] Friends,
[1:18:56] these are incredible times.
[1:18:59] But when you look at those pictures
[1:19:02] and I did not look at those pictures
[1:19:06] I've been to I've been to I've been to
[1:19:08] Ashwitz. Lots of been people been to
[1:19:10] Awitz. That doesn't mean anything. A lot
[1:19:14] of people have seen the same same things
[1:19:15] we've seen. They don't have a prophet
[1:19:18] who says the same thing.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; That's what stirs a person's heart.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; At least it should.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:30] to look at those rooms to look at those
[1:19:33] places and I stood in front of those
[1:19:36] ovens. I'm not bringing it back in my
[1:19:38] memory now, but I did stand in front of
[1:19:41] those ovens and realize that there was
[1:19:44] people that had to wheel those bodies in
[1:19:46] and wheel them out. And here somehow
[1:19:52] God was receiving a life
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; as a sacrifice.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; And they didn't know that in moments
[1:20:03] they're going to have a white robe.
[1:20:06] [Applause]
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; They didn't know there was a tender hand
[1:20:10] of Jehovah
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; driving their offspring and future
[1:20:16] people.
[1:20:19] and become a nation because be why to
[1:20:22] fulfill the word of God. He has to go
[1:20:25] there and reveal himself to them.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; How precious is the plan of God. Listen
[1:20:30] to me church.
[1:20:33] If you never hear me again, listen to me
[1:20:36] this last time.
[1:20:40] This word that carries God's blessing is
[1:20:44] the only purpose and cause you have in
[1:20:48] life.
[1:20:49] [Applause]
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; There's not another thing
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; to be a carpenter
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; or to be a steward on airline, brother
[1:21:00] Milant.
[1:21:05] What is all of that?
[1:21:08] Where's that going to go? There's
[1:21:09] multitudes of them.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; To be a teacher or to be a principal or
[1:21:14] to be a educated person, that's
[1:21:17] wonderful just in this life.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; But the only purpose, the only purpose
[1:21:22] is for the cause of Christ.
[1:21:26] [Applause]
[1:21:32] And now that I've come to that point,
[1:21:36] we have a certain vision.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; That vision is not a human vision.
[1:21:42] That h that vision is something that has
[1:21:44] come painfully
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; through the message of the hour.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; The message is not an easy message.
[1:21:54] The message is not a uh something that's
[1:21:57] compatible with this generation.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; I knew the way that the prophet spoke
[1:22:07] about homosexuality
[1:22:10] and the perversion of the world that
[1:22:13] could never be popular in America or
[1:22:16] Canada.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Could never be popular and it cannot be
[1:22:20] popular in the world. Nevertheless, he
[1:22:24] was speaking God's thought
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; and it'll never be compatible with human
[1:22:30] thought
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; or modern thought.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; So, we have a very difficult situation.
[1:22:38] You're living in a modern world.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; You're educated into modern thought
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; and it is imposed upon you. That's
[1:22:50] right.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; You're strange if you don't believe it.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; And then you go to church and hear
[1:22:56] something else.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; And now you're put into a battle every
[1:23:00] day.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; What is it that we're going to believe?
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Are we going to believe what we're
[1:23:08] taught?
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Are we going to believe what is required
[1:23:12] in this world?
[1:23:27] We had a number of
[1:23:29] and perhaps still do
[1:23:32] a number of police officers.
[1:23:38] I asked
[1:23:41] John Bin in China when we were under
[1:23:45] arrest.
[1:23:47] Have since have since asked his wife,
[1:23:56] they have one son.
[1:23:59] Are you Do you think about another
[1:24:01] child? Oh, no, no, no, no. That's that's
[1:24:04] out of the question because
[1:24:08] The regulations at that time was one
[1:24:11] child.
[1:24:14] The regulations
[1:24:17] in this country
[1:24:20] have to do with perverted life and
[1:24:22] making it acceptable because we are what
[1:24:25] is called an inclusive
[1:24:29] an inclusive society.
[1:24:33] An acceptable society.
[1:24:36] And that is perfectly fine to a degree.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; But there are some things that you
[1:24:44] cannot fellowship with.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; There are some things that you cannot be
[1:24:49] in harmony with.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; And I knew that our some of our brothers
[1:24:57] that are in the police force
[1:25:00] are going to run
[1:25:02] into a collision.
[1:25:13] This Bible
[1:25:15] is on a collision course with modern
[1:25:18] thought.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; And you cannot serve both of them.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; That just happens to be a reality.
[1:25:38] That just happens to be reality.
[1:25:42] And
[1:25:46] good times may not also always be
[1:25:51] the kind of
[1:25:54] times that we are expecting.
[1:25:58] this message of commitment
[1:26:01] to a cause, the cause of Christ
[1:26:05] revealed in this day. Brother Brandham
[1:26:07] was uh you know he had a lot a court
[1:26:11] case against him and it was on taxes and
[1:26:15] I'll tell you exactly why. So I hope
[1:26:18] everybody's listening and on the
[1:26:19] internet.
[1:26:21] He would get a
[1:26:24] they'd take offerings of course in these
[1:26:27] large meetings sometimes take an
[1:26:29] offering. He he wouldn't, but there
[1:26:31] would be offerings taken. And so people
[1:26:33] would just write a check, you know,
[1:26:35] Billy Brandham or to Brother Bill or
[1:26:37] however it was, brother Brandham,
[1:26:42] and they would just go in to the
[1:26:44] association
[1:26:46] to pay for the cost of the
[1:26:50] uh and and when I was with him in the
[1:26:52] early 60s, he was he was still he was
[1:26:54] just getting a salary at that time,
[1:26:58] and it was $100 a week,
[1:27:01] $400.
[1:27:02] about $400 a month at that time
[1:27:07] and that is why we here just get a
[1:27:10] salary as a ministers we get a salary
[1:27:14] we do not
[1:27:16] this business whatever anyone else wants
[1:27:18] to think that's up to them
[1:27:21] but I want to keep it squeaky clean
[1:27:25] and uh so some years later a tax
[1:27:31] inspector
[1:27:33] came against him after for back taxes
[1:27:38] and actually that's why I was in
[1:27:40] Toronto. I was waiting to go and to he
[1:27:45] had asked me specifically to write a
[1:27:48] proposal to the trustees
[1:27:51] and to
[1:27:53] uh he said he'd like to bring his books
[1:27:56] his books not the spoken word books but
[1:27:59] his books which are like 20th century
[1:28:01] prophet etc
[1:28:04] under or prophet visits South Africa and
[1:28:08] bring them into one office and look
[1:28:11] after the tapes. And he said, "I the
[1:28:14] tapes are sometimes not good quality."
[1:28:19] And he says, "I have widows is what he
[1:28:21] said. I have widows and they play the
[1:28:24] tape and half of it is is blank." And he
[1:28:28] said then he said, "Then they always
[1:28:30] write me." And you'll find that also in
[1:28:32] on the on the tape. He speaks about it.
[1:28:36] So the last letter which I have at home
[1:28:40] was from Billy Paul and I was asking
[1:28:43] some specific questions as to how many
[1:28:45] were on the list etc because I wanted to
[1:28:48] make sure that I could make a living for
[1:28:51] my family and they said there was 800
[1:28:54] and some that were on the list in the
[1:28:57] last meeting which was uh July I think
[1:28:59] in 1965
[1:29:01] and he said and daddy doesn't want to
[1:29:04] make a major decision until the tax case
[1:29:08] is settled and it wasn't settled until
[1:29:10] 1965.
[1:29:13] And uh
[1:29:15] so he's talking about that and he says
[1:29:18] he says and then they they'll send
[1:29:21] people away in
[1:29:24] federal prison for 20 years.
[1:29:27] And so he says I was at the an attorney.
[1:29:31] I was t he was talking to an one of the
[1:29:33] attorneys and and I had to go up to
[1:29:36] Chicago I think for the for the court
[1:29:39] case. So if you sit as quietly as
[1:29:42] possible. And uh so he said,
[1:29:46] "Well, I have brothers in the federal
[1:29:48] prison."
[1:29:50] He said, and the attorney says, "You
[1:29:52] have?" Well, he said, "I did have."
[1:29:56] He said, "Well, what's their name?"
[1:29:59] Well, he said, 'Well, one was John John
[1:30:03] and Alcatraz of Patmas, right?
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; He said he was a federal in the federal
[1:30:08] prison. And he said, and and then
[1:30:11] another brother is is Paul, and he was
[1:30:14] in a Roman federal prison. And then
[1:30:17] Daniel was in one, and uh and he was in
[1:30:21] a federal prison. And then ju Joseph was
[1:30:24] in a federal prison accused of the
[1:30:27] potterer's by potterer's wife and he
[1:30:29] said he spent there and his hairs all
[1:30:31] grew out and and uh he said he had they
[1:30:34] even had to shave him before he could
[1:30:36] come before Pharaoh. He said uh uh oh
[1:30:40] I've had a lot of brothers in the
[1:30:41] federal prison.
[1:30:44] I thought they're my brothers, too.
[1:30:51] Is this all right?
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Those people were committed.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; They were young men, but they were
[1:31:01] committed.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; This church exists
[1:31:09] because
[1:31:10] of this message.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Listen to me now. This church that
[1:31:14] you're sitting in exists
[1:31:18] because of a commitment to this message.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Used to be just a lot of young people.
[1:31:28] Then they married,
[1:31:31] they had children
[1:31:33] and their children needed a school.
[1:31:37] That school over there, BCA,
[1:31:42] is a part of this church
[1:31:48] and it needs to be committed to this
[1:31:52] message.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not asking you for your agreement.
[1:31:56] I'm telling you that.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Mount Baker Bible Way Camp.
[1:32:04] It's another entity.
[1:32:06] Bible believers of Washington is another
[1:32:10] entity.
[1:32:11] I am here to announce that these
[1:32:14] entities.
[1:32:16] Yeah, they're pieces of paper that have
[1:32:19] been established etc. But they exist
[1:32:22] because of this message.
[1:32:26] And furthermore, I believe that this
[1:32:30] message actually is carrying or is
[1:32:34] packing because I can take years and
[1:32:38] years and years and years of messages
[1:32:42] and I find the same God
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; that's visiting on the first message is
[1:32:48] still there on the last message.
[1:32:51] [Applause]
[1:32:53] And I find if he didn't change his mind,
[1:32:56] I don't plan to change my mind.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; And if I change my mind, I'd like you to
[1:33:05] show me someone that has the same
[1:33:08] vindication,
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; the same supernatural
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; to give me authorization
[1:33:15] to change from this to that.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, I'm not interested in men's
[1:33:20] minds. or their opinions or their
[1:33:24] reasoning or anyone else. I'm not
[1:33:28] interested in their smarts. I'm not
[1:33:30] interested in their ignorance. I'm not
[1:33:32] interested in anything. But I need to
[1:33:34] satisfy myself because I have a soul.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; I'm responsible for my wife. She has a
[1:33:43] soul.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; I'm responsible for my children. They
[1:33:48] have a soul.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. You better have a very good
[1:33:52] argument.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm serious about these
[1:34:00] things.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; You have a soul.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; You young people, you children, you have
[1:34:09] a soul.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; And here is a soul.
[1:34:28] those people of having to do with I see
[1:34:32] I see sitting here in the congregation
[1:34:36] I personally believe that we have a
[1:34:38] great responsibility
[1:34:41] we say well it's a BCA and it's a school
[1:34:44] or MM MBBC DC or Mount Baker Bible Way
[1:34:48] Camp or Bible Believers of Washington.
[1:34:51] Bible Believers of Washington came about
[1:34:54] because there were many Americans that
[1:34:57] were moving into the Washington area and
[1:35:00] I simply said into the office one day.
[1:35:04] We we give people tithe receipts and
[1:35:07] whatever it has to be seamless and
[1:35:09] whatever we do in Canada, we got to be
[1:35:11] able to do in the States. That's why it
[1:35:14] exists.
[1:35:15] but it's because something was happening
[1:35:19] and when people are saying I'm attracted
[1:35:21] to that
[1:35:23] and I would respond, "God bless you,
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; or you come from China or you come from
[1:35:28] Africa or wherever or we we we don't
[1:35:31] just have a a little phrase and say,
[1:35:34] well, it's multic multicultural and so
[1:35:36] on so forth." Those are all modern
[1:35:38] terms, but I as far as I'm concerned,
[1:35:41] it's men and women
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; gripped by the same thing.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; I'm not an old man. Just uh I these are
[1:35:52] things that I've pondered for a long
[1:35:54] time.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; And they are they exist. This church
[1:35:59] exists because a message of the hour has
[1:36:04] gripped people's hearts and they have
[1:36:06] become committed to the cause.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; And now I'm going to go a little bit
[1:36:15] further. Is that all right, brother Tom?
[1:36:20] I'm going to go a little bit further.
[1:36:23] I don't feel
[1:36:25] right in my heart about people
[1:36:32] just becoming attached
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; and
[1:36:38] living off the avails
[1:36:41] of the sacrifice of others.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Listen folks, people sacrificed
[1:36:49] to build this building.
[1:36:52] Yes, sir.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; People sacrificed. People sacrificed
[1:36:56] to put Bible
[1:37:00] the BCA together. People sacrificed
[1:37:05] incredibly and still do. Yeah.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; And I thought of you, brother Norm
[1:37:10] Woods.
[1:37:11] So quietly,
[1:37:13] brother, you brother Kim Dingwall,
[1:37:16] so quietly
[1:37:20] the people at large don't know
[1:37:26] of the positions and the salary you turn
[1:37:29] down.
[1:37:32] And you, brother Norm Woods,
[1:37:35] vice president
[1:37:37] in Lafarge concrete.
[1:37:40] I may happen to know that. Many don't
[1:37:42] know that. And you retire and give
[1:37:46] yourself to the young people.
[1:37:51] Do you kids appreciate that?
[1:37:57] Is the vice president
[1:38:00] of a concrete company.
[1:38:03] Lefar cement
[1:38:06] and comes and teaches
[1:38:08] uh a class at school. And I don't know
[1:38:12] many of you kids maybe sat there and had
[1:38:16] brother Norm Woods or
[1:38:20] Brother Kim Dingwall and other people
[1:38:22] come in there and it doesn't matter what
[1:38:24] they do.
[1:38:26] It doesn't matter what they do.
[1:38:30] It's, you know, I I see your brother Sam
[1:38:32] Waldner. Brother Sam was there on his
[1:38:35] knees putting putting the tile on the
[1:38:37] floor and and so on and and I just
[1:38:40] thought, well, that doesn't take a whole
[1:38:43] lot of genius. And I'll just watch him
[1:38:46] and and and he was so particular, you
[1:38:49] know, he
[1:38:51] if I didn't lay it just right, he'd rip
[1:38:53] it up and put it down again. And his
[1:38:56] great big strong hands and God bless
[1:38:59] you. But that's how it happened. And
[1:39:01] then others, you know, other people just
[1:39:03] tood in say, well, you know, it's nice
[1:39:05] school and oh, wonderful. And, you know,
[1:39:09] they don't give a thought about
[1:39:10] anything.
[1:39:13] It wasn't for that purpose. and you who
[1:39:17] have come after.
[1:39:22] That's why I appreciated I wrote those
[1:39:24] words down
[1:39:27] that all who come behind us
[1:39:31] find us faithful.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; And you kids that are you young people,
[1:39:38] you're going to have somebody coming
[1:39:39] behind.
[1:39:43] And I want to counsel you today. Do
[1:39:50] what I've tried to do
[1:39:56] and be committed to it.
[1:40:00] It's not in and out and up and down. And
[1:40:03] I've tried to live steady.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; I've tried to live stable.
[1:40:09] I've tried to live honorably and with
[1:40:12] integrity. I've really tried to do that.
[1:40:15] It's not always easy.
[1:40:18] And you're you can be misunderstood. I'm
[1:40:21] not
[1:40:22] Please don't forgive. Don't for don't
[1:40:25] don't don't misunderstand me uh you know
[1:40:28] unnecessarily.
[1:40:33] And I I I still want to preach just a
[1:40:35] wee bit. Can I do that?
[1:40:38] Now, I actually did all of that to set
[1:40:41] the kind of the foundation so you can
[1:40:43] see where I'm going.
[1:40:46] I believe that people that want to come
[1:40:48] and have benefits
[1:40:53] of the church,
[1:40:55] benefits of the school,
[1:40:58] benefits of the camp,
[1:41:02] benefits of the missions. They also need
[1:41:05] to know that we are in expectation of a
[1:41:09] commitment.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; You folks need to support that.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what I believe. I believe
[1:41:18] it's wrong for Holy Ghost teachers to
[1:41:23] sit here to be in this church. Or others
[1:41:27] say, well, no, I don't agree with the
[1:41:30] you don't agree with the headship
[1:41:33] of the church or you don't agree with
[1:41:35] the headship of the camp or the headship
[1:41:38] of the school.
[1:41:40] Listen friends,
[1:41:42] that whole thing exists because
[1:41:46] of what burden.
[1:41:48] And I want the people to know it is a
[1:41:51] burden.
[1:41:53] And when it gets right down where the
[1:41:55] rubber hits the road and then the issues
[1:41:59] come to rest here
[1:42:02] about the uncleanness or about uh if
[1:42:06] there's anything to do with the law,
[1:42:09] anything to do with the regulations,
[1:42:12] there's a few people that have to worry
[1:42:14] about it
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; and some of them are on this platform
[1:42:22] and we may be the ones that are laying
[1:42:24] awake at night
[1:42:26] wondering and praying.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; My wife came and stood behind me in the
[1:42:36] study
[1:42:38] early in the morning the other day and
[1:42:41] said,
[1:42:43] "How did you sleep?"
[1:42:46] Well,
[1:42:48] why?
[1:42:49] Well, she said, "You were saying
[1:42:51] something. You were talking in your
[1:42:52] sleep.
[1:42:54] Really?
[1:42:57] She said, "Well, yeah." You said, "Oh,
[1:42:58] Lord."
[1:43:01] I said, "Well, yeah, that's you know,"
[1:43:04] she said, "It sound like you're maybe
[1:43:06] praying or something." Oh Lord. You
[1:43:10] know, there's only one person that you
[1:43:12] can go to at certain times.
[1:43:15] When you got things that need to be
[1:43:17] resolved,
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; and it's him,
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; the lovely one,
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; the one who could say,
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; "Yes,
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; I give them white robes."
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; I call it the tender hand of Jehovah.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; And I thought, I got to speak on it.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; And I know that that's not a this isn't
[1:43:40] a regular service. This isn't something
[1:43:42] that you're going to, you know, I I'm
[1:43:45] letting it go out on the internet, but
[1:43:47] nevertheless, I'm glad for you that are
[1:43:49] here.
[1:43:51] I'm glad that you're sitting here
[1:43:53] listening and giving me a time. But I
[1:43:56] tell you, I'm speaking from if you read
[1:43:59] ma if you read Malachi 1 and 1, it
[1:44:02] starts out the burden of the word of the
[1:44:04] Lord.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Another prophet starts out the burden of
[1:44:08] the word of the Lord. Let me tell you
[1:44:11] friends and I had a a a minister here
[1:44:14] just a few days ago and he's from the
[1:44:16] eastern part of the world and he said I
[1:44:20] I want to ask you about the church. I
[1:44:22] want to ask you about how you conduct
[1:44:24] things and and the affairs of the church
[1:44:26] and how how do you handle the financial
[1:44:29] things and I was so glad I could just be
[1:44:32] entirely open with him because they've
[1:44:34] seen things and they've seen things that
[1:44:37] they admire. They've seen things that
[1:44:39] have have lived through the storms of
[1:44:42] time. Listen folks, we've gone through
[1:44:44] storms.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; We've gone through false accusations.
[1:44:48] We've gone through lies, absolute lies,
[1:44:51] but we've come through the other side.
[1:44:54] And I have one thing to say about it.
[1:44:56] It's because of the blessing of God upon
[1:44:59] the word. Not because of our character.
[1:45:02] Not because of any of those things, but
[1:45:04] because the blessing of God is upon the
[1:45:07] word. And he and if he sees you as a
[1:45:09] servant,
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; a servant of the word, this young lady,
[1:45:13] this man, they're going to live this
[1:45:15] word. You will be blessed of God.
[1:45:19] [Music]
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; The blessing is on the word.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; And it's irreversibly upon the word.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; That's where the blessing of God is in
[1:45:32] this world. Amen.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; And if you live just to raise a family
[1:45:36] and live and die, it's nothing more than
[1:45:39] the rest of humanity. But you say, "I
[1:45:42] have a cause."
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; And it's the cause of Christ.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; That's the cause.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; I have a real cause.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; And if you only affect one,
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; it's worthwhile.
[1:45:57] If you only influence one into the
[1:45:59] kingdom of God,
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; it's worthwhile.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; You know, when things
[1:46:13] and I'm going to close in a few moments,
[1:46:23] but I like to know where something
[1:46:24] originates.
[1:46:29] And if this
[1:46:33] if this has a blessing,
[1:46:36] if there's a blessing on this message,
[1:46:39] I want to have you have a look at this.
[1:46:45] This is a prayer
[1:46:50] and the prayer involves as a commitment.
[1:46:57] Lord God, I promise you a new
[1:47:06] I'm taking this in steps. A I promise
[1:47:12] it might help you
[1:47:17] to say those words.
[1:47:20] I promise.
[1:47:23] Do you dare?
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; I promise.
[1:47:28] I promise a new.
[1:47:36] Let me live. And this request comes, let
[1:47:39] me live as long as you have desire of me
[1:47:43] living.
[1:47:46] Not how long I desire to live, but as
[1:47:49] long as you desire me to live.
[1:47:53] And then the prayer,
[1:47:56] let me be true to the principles of this
[1:47:59] word
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; and then surrender.
[1:48:08] May I live till I can dismiss
[1:48:12] my own thoughts
[1:48:16] and dismiss my own life.
[1:48:21] This is deep.
[1:48:25] Dismiss my own life and let the life of
[1:48:28] Jesus Christ reflect through it in his
[1:48:32] promised word of this age.
[1:48:36] And then prayer for others. And may this
[1:48:40] great promise come upon everyone
[1:48:44] that's present now. For we ask it in
[1:48:48] Jesus name. And that Jesus happens to be
[1:48:52] living. That Jesus happens to be in this
[1:48:55] place. That Jesus happens to be standing
[1:48:59] here listening to me.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; And this prayer of this prophet and this
[1:49:05] prayer which I read, I I I am praying
[1:49:09] for you.
[1:49:13] May I so live till I can dismiss my own
[1:49:17] thoughts, dismiss my own life, and let
[1:49:21] the life of Jesus Christ reflect through
[1:49:24] it in his promised word. And may this
[1:49:29] great promise,
[1:49:33] hello all the congregation,
[1:49:35] this is the word that is carrying the
[1:49:38] blessings of the almighty God. There is
[1:49:42] no other word. There's no other word
[1:49:44] that I know of. There's books and books
[1:49:46] on theology.
[1:49:48] I cannot guarantee you that the
[1:49:51] blessings of the Almighty is upon that.
[1:49:54] But I know that this happens to be I'm a
[1:49:57] simple person. This happens to be a
[1:50:00] word. Listen, congregation, you've come
[1:50:02] here as committed people cuz you come
[1:50:05] here for Sunday. You come here to hear
[1:50:07] the word. You're committed to it. I'm
[1:50:10] I'm taking your commitment seriously
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; and people contribute marvelously.
[1:50:17] They labor incredibly to make this all
[1:50:21] possible. I am indebted, eternally
[1:50:24] indebted to the people of this
[1:50:28] congregation.
[1:50:31] I see your brother Esther Hazen. He
[1:50:34] sends a report every Saturday night. I
[1:50:39] receive it on and our brother Kobus I
[1:50:43] tell you what you may sit there but I
[1:50:45] appreciate it. You may think that you're
[1:50:48] not seen or recognized but I I do.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; I see you there and I can tell you it
[1:50:54] was 560ome
[1:50:56] sentences. He numbers the sentences that
[1:50:59] have been proof read
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; from one week to the next week and sends
[1:51:04] it to brother brother Tim Dodd and
[1:51:07] myself.
[1:51:09] That's incredible that somebody sits
[1:51:11] here in the church
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; and counts the sentences
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; that have been proof read of this
[1:51:18] message.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; I can tell you that God's blessings are
[1:51:23] upon a life that does that. That's a
[1:51:26] commitment of a kind.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Unrecognized,
[1:51:32] no great big band playing,
[1:51:36] no big office in the church, but
[1:51:40] something's in the heart says this needs
[1:51:42] to be done and just goes ahead and does
[1:51:45] it. I say God bless you.
[1:51:49] But more than that, the God of the word,
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; I'm saying it flat out. Whoever that God
[1:51:57] is, whoever that God is, I even said in
[1:52:01] prayer this morning, God, let me know
[1:52:04] you better. Let me understand you
[1:52:08] because it's so so mysterious. some of
[1:52:13] the things that he does.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; I find it incredibly mysterious
[1:52:20] when he can take stacks of human bodies
[1:52:25] and say it's a tender hand
[1:52:28] and have a man I can tell you he's
[1:52:31] dismissed
[1:52:32] all reasonable thought.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; He's dismissed his own blind thought.
[1:52:40] He's dismissed his own affection.
[1:52:43] He's dismissed it completely. Say it's
[1:52:46] the tender hand of Jehovah driving him
[1:52:50] back because that's what the word of God
[1:52:53] declares.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; I had a leader. Can I go on a moment or
[1:53:01] two?
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; I had a leader of the Israeli people
[1:53:05] that came here and spoke. Garrison
[1:53:07] Solomon. How many were in the meetings?
[1:53:10] Raise your hands.
[1:53:14] Many of you. Gen Solomon.
[1:53:18] I drove him and his wife to the motel
[1:53:21] down here, the Ramada.
[1:53:25] We were parked outside. his wife had
[1:53:26] gotten out and she was at the door
[1:53:33] and he was sitting there with me and he
[1:53:35] said
[1:53:37] just uh privately he said my wife
[1:53:42] she cannot get over that holocaust. She
[1:53:47] just cannot
[1:53:50] accept it. She cannot get over it.
[1:53:54] And I said, "Well, you know what our
[1:53:56] prophet said?"
[1:53:59] I said, "Our prophet said it was the
[1:54:01] tender hand of Jehovah,
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; right?"
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; And he just looked at my glove box. He
[1:54:08] couldn't understand that for the moment.
[1:54:11] I said, "Because
[1:54:13] he said, you people have be back in it
[1:54:17] took that to drive you back into your
[1:54:20] homeland. and God cannot bless you until
[1:54:23] you're in your homeland.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; And he said, "That is right."
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; And I walked I got out of the car and I
[1:54:34] walked to the I walked to the front
[1:54:36] door. Listen friends, I'm not telling
[1:54:37] you stories. I'm telling you about
[1:54:38] events
[1:54:40] about you, about the people of this
[1:54:42] congregation. And I walked to the door
[1:54:44] where Naomi's hand was on the handle of
[1:54:47] the door. She was going to pull a ramada
[1:54:49] handle open.
[1:54:51] Yeah. She said, "I've never met people
[1:54:53] like this."
[1:54:56] And pulled the door open.
[1:55:00] Friends, that's your testimony.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[1:55:06] that's the message testimony.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; You don't know what what what you're
[1:55:14] echoing out.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; You don't know what you're screaming
[1:55:18] out. You don't know what kind of because
[1:55:22] because our service is being streamed
[1:55:24] this morning. Some things I can't even
[1:55:26] say because they were just spoken the
[1:55:28] other day to my wife.
[1:55:33] She invited
[1:55:35] a businessman from downtown to be
[1:55:38] streaming the service this morning. And
[1:55:41] he may be
[1:55:48] You don't know how far the testimony is
[1:55:50] going. Right.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; I personally feel I personally feel
[1:56:00] that we have a responsibility to be
[1:56:03] committed to this message
[1:56:06] that we need to renew it
[1:56:09] perhaps.
[1:56:16] I feel I'm just going to
[1:56:24] going to bring the service to a close.
[1:56:32] I'll maybe make a personal confession
[1:56:36] and that is that I
[1:56:38] I'm very very desirous to be connected
[1:56:43] to that world.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:56:53] and the message. Let me just go over
[1:56:55] these quickly.
[1:57:05] I don't know if you've ever heard this.
[1:57:08] Brother Brandham says,
[1:57:12] he says, "Now quickly to a vision. It
[1:57:15] happened two years ago. I was in my room
[1:57:20] right after a big meeting and I seen a
[1:57:22] rocky hilly country
[1:57:25] just as natural. Not a dream, he said.
[1:57:29] Can you hear me? All right.
[1:57:31] Not a dream. In a dream, a vision is
[1:57:34] something you're looking at like I'm
[1:57:37] looking right now to you
[1:57:41] or you looking at me.
[1:57:44] Sometimes I'd be standing
[1:57:47] right like this and I'd sit in my room,
[1:57:52] been sitting in my room talking to my
[1:57:54] family
[1:57:56] and move completely away,
[1:58:00] be gone for an hour uh and a half or two
[1:58:04] hours.
[1:58:07] Listen friends, I'm not telling you a
[1:58:09] story.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; This is something you say, "I'm
[1:58:12] connected with this. Amen.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to I'm going to make a
[1:58:19] statement in just a moment which I made
[1:58:21] before. This is where this message
[1:58:23] originated.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; It didn't come out of Louisville.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Didn't come out of Jeffersonville.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Came out of eternity.
[1:58:34] Amen.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And I'd sit there
[1:58:41] perfectly still without a speck of
[1:58:43] breath."
[1:58:45] Do I have to say that again? Without a
[1:58:47] speck of breath.
[1:58:52] And you don't understand that. Neither
[1:58:53] do I. But that's fine. He said, "And
[1:58:56] that's what medical science can't
[1:58:58] understand.
[1:59:00] where it done not even a speck of
[1:59:02] breath.
[1:59:04] You could put a fine a thing of any as
[1:59:08] you want
[1:59:11] around my nose
[1:59:14] and not a bit of breath they tell me.
[1:59:18] But my respirations,
[1:59:20] heartbeats just the same, but they don't
[1:59:24] understand it.
[1:59:27] Now listen friends and he says fading
[1:59:30] out into another country,
[1:59:33] another world
[1:59:35] and when you return you have just
[1:59:38] exactly what God had said and it's never
[1:59:42] failed and it can't. It's God.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; I just stopped there.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; That deserves
[1:59:53] a real commitment.
[1:59:59] If I never see you again, I will say
[2:00:01] this. We have a cause.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; We now have a purpose to live.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; You will not get this in the finest of
[2:00:11] schools. You'll not get this in a Bible
[2:00:15] school.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; And the same prophet says the church is
[2:00:20] a mess.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:00:23] And I am so thankful to God that at
[2:00:26] least we have a place where we can come
[2:00:28] and sit. And this is a spiritual
[2:00:30] reprieve.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; You can sit here.
[2:00:38] You can rest yourself and you can know
[2:00:42] for certain you're not going to hear
[2:00:44] something wonky.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; There's no kingdom building. That's
[2:00:49] right.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; I've told the people in Switzerland,
[2:00:52] I'll say to these people here, I am
[2:00:54] personally resentful against anybody
[2:00:57] trying to build a kingdom. What human
[2:01:00] thinks he's worthy of a kingdom?
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; What What person has a a a a ministry
[2:01:07] that's worth following and he himself's
[2:01:10] going to fall into the grave?
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; I say, I want them to be connected to
[2:01:14] the eternal one.
[2:01:17] Yes.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; But that we might know him better.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; That we might not that we might be
[2:01:26] connected with him. Brother Roy.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; So I hear little simple things.
[2:01:33] I hear a prophet saying to and I've said
[2:01:36] it here several time might not mean
[2:01:38] anything to you
[2:01:40] but it means volumes to me.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:01:46] Isn't he lovely?
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Isn't he lovely?
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; I think though, where is he at? What's
[2:01:55] he seeing?
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Who's he seeing?
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; Let me let me and I and I yearn for that
[2:02:05] contact.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; And God helps me to enter into that
[2:02:09] place. And that's what I pray. I ask for
[2:02:14] this congregation,
[2:02:16] Lord.
[2:02:18] Let them feel that same feeling.
[2:02:22] Let them let them experience,
[2:02:26] not the discernment.
[2:02:29] Let him let them experience this lovely
[2:02:31] one. You're on the balcony.
[2:02:35] Oh, that you might know him.
[2:02:39] Experience this lovely one. I know that
[2:02:42] you've got work to do and bills to pay
[2:02:45] and that's this world.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Listen close now. You got things to
[2:02:52] study. You got burdens of life. You got
[2:02:55] all kinds of things. That's this world
[2:02:58] and it's passing and you're going to
[2:03:01] leave it. Right. Right.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; But the thing that got a hold of you and
[2:03:05] have pulled you in here
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; and made a a group of people, we call it
[2:03:10] Cloverdale Bible Way. That's just a
[2:03:12] name.
[2:03:14] But it's you
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; the people
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; that God, the eternal God said, "That's
[2:03:21] my child
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; and they're worthy of my tenderness.
[2:03:29] And in his tenderness, he may do things
[2:03:31] that you don't understand.
[2:03:45] Sometimes they say, "Well, that I I laid
[2:03:48] a couple challenges out." I said, "Well,
[2:03:51] look at this. If you look at these
[2:03:53] photos
[2:03:55] and the problem is we look at it and our
[2:03:57] eyes register in the brains and and then
[2:04:00] our emotions get all caught up into it
[2:04:03] and we see the young people, we see the
[2:04:05] babies." You know what? God, for some
[2:04:08] reason,
[2:04:10] he allows, and I I just began to go
[2:04:12] across the congregation,
[2:04:17] there's quite a number here
[2:04:19] that are living without their loved
[2:04:21] ones.
[2:04:24] And some of them went very, very young.
[2:04:28] My mother went when I was six and a
[2:04:30] half.
[2:04:32] My daughters are three here sitting in
[2:04:34] this congregation. They've never seen
[2:04:36] her.
[2:04:38] They've never seen her grandma.
[2:04:41] And she's never seen them.
[2:04:45] Why did she go?
[2:04:48] Was it just a death
[2:04:51] or was there some further purpose?
[2:04:55] So, I've got to mold this little boy.
[2:05:00] I've got to mold him. He's got to He's
[2:05:02] got to go someplace.
[2:05:04] He's got to go in the strange lands.
[2:05:08] He's got to live alone a lot of the
[2:05:10] time.
[2:05:14] There's other people here. And I don't
[2:05:17] want to start naming names.
[2:05:28] But I can tell you the loss.
[2:05:33] The loss of life
[2:05:37] to us is one thing but to our father is
[2:05:41] quite another.
[2:05:44] And when I think in terms and I want you
[2:05:46] to think in terms when you can look at
[2:05:49] just utter
[2:05:54] such sadness
[2:05:57] and hear the words
[2:06:00] tender hand of Jehovah,
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; It'll change you.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:08] When you hear the words, you didn't
[2:06:12] invent the words and they didn't come
[2:06:14] out of Bible school.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Came from God. Came from eternity.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Said, I give you and to them was given
[2:06:26] white robes.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; I want to have one.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; I want to have what the word has
[2:06:35] promised
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; and I believe that we will. God bless
[2:06:39] you and thank you for your patience.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bless you.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads, please.
[2:06:50] Dear Lord Jesus,
[2:06:54] Lord Jesus,
[2:06:57] my Lord and my God,
[2:07:01] Father
[2:07:04] which are in heaven,
[2:07:07] a God that
[2:07:10] whose thoughts have been made known.
[2:07:14] And now I have spoken some of the things
[2:07:17] which have been strange. I know they've
[2:07:20] been strange to the people. I know that
[2:07:22] they're going to ponder them and they're
[2:07:24] going to think about them and they may
[2:07:27] have questions about them.
[2:07:30] But Lord, I in the quietness of this
[2:07:32] moment, I'm asking you to do something
[2:07:38] very substantial
[2:07:40] within the lives, within the souls and
[2:07:44] the hearts of this congregation that s
[2:07:47] that is seated here before me. I pray,
[2:07:50] oh God, that you will move them in an
[2:07:56] eternal realm.
[2:07:58] Oh, Father God,
[2:08:01] move them, I pray, into a realm of
[2:08:03] understanding
[2:08:05] in a place, oh God, where they will
[2:08:07] understand. And we want to understand
[2:08:09] your thoughts and understand why you do
[2:08:13] certain things. We don't need to know,
[2:08:15] but we say you do all things well.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; We say bless your name. I thank you,
[2:08:22] Father. I thank you so much in the name
[2:08:25] of Jesus Christ.
[2:08:28] Amen.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; What's that song we used to say? Uh,
[2:08:42] I can almost see the lights of home.
[2:08:48] I can almost see the lights of home. Is
[2:08:51] Donnie Rambo's song?
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Is that the lights of home? Yeah. Do you
[2:08:57] know that, Brother Ryan? Is that the
[2:08:58] lights of home? Is that the lights of
[2:09:01] home?

[2:09:14] [Music]
[2:09:20] [Music]
[2:09:22] I want to sing a few
[2:09:25] verses of that chorus first. That chorus
[2:09:27] is that the lights of home
[2:09:29] [Music]
[2:09:34] is that. Can you sing that, brother?
[2:09:41] Home I see
[2:09:45] I feel
[2:09:48] a breeze from that crystal sea.

[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Is that the lights
[2:10:59] of all I see?
[2:11:03] Do I feel free
[2:11:08] from that crystal?
[2:11:10] [Music]
[2:11:12] Is that the Lord standing high
[2:11:17] on heaven's balcony?
[2:11:22] If that's a light song,
[2:11:27] it's a welcome sign.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand, please. Is that the
