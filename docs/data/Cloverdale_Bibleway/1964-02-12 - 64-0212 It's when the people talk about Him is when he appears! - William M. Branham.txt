Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's Jesus Christ revealing Him just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
always through the scripture it's when the people talk about God that's when he appeared now we're too busy talking about other things I think that's the reason many people who love him fail to see him we're so busy with our Creeds and denominations and business about the churches and memberships and getting more members and things we're too busy to talk about him he's the word we're too interested what the some Creed some textbook or something else says how many members can we get in vote them in shall we take this one that one the other we should be constantly giving ourselves to the word of God In Prayer studying the word but we're too interested in something else
