========================================
[Music] we're [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] hallelujah welcome to the service this morning everybody happy to be here wonderful to see you I see so many faces we appreciate love each and every one of you if I started naming names we'd be here longer than I'm supposed to be here brother Kyle sister Christina is so good to have you here with us brother Kyle why don't you come and open the service in a word of Prayer amen really looking forward to the service today the children's choirs or the sunday-school is going to come in and sing in just a moment but we want to invite the Lord Jesus into the service this morning into our hearts it's good to have each of you here this morning but the Tom's got a baby dedication this morning so it'll be a full day amen brother Kyle thank you we adore you Lord Jesus there's no one who captures our affection like you do Lord we're so thankful what you've done in our lives so thank you for you've sent a message so we can see you so clearly Lord Jesus we just pray this afternoon Lord you help us able to relax to be able to hear your word Lord for our faith to ascend Lord we all have such needs such burdens such pleas and cries of our hearts but you see them all Lord for those in our midst for a sickened body with us brother Timothy Ron toko or different ones Lord we all have needs in our body may touch us Lord for those who have

offering this morning it's the children we'll just be getting ready to come in just any moment we certainly thank you all right take a moment and welcome each one that's gathered here in a in the visible congregation and those that are connected with us by way of streaming the borders are a little bit of a zoo so you might see a gap here there where the u.s. folks had to stay on the other side there's lots of family so it's good to be a testimony and go and visit the sides of the family that don't necessarily come here to church but the Lord knows each and every one we do want to make a quick note there's a note on the bulletin board for a get-together on January 1st so if you'd like more information on that that's on the bulletin board we've also have sister huambo from Australia and sister Beulah from Winnipeg so maybe they could raise their hands real high welcome them here this morning god bless you you're down here amen very nice to have you here brother Joseph and sister Naomi are gonna have their little one dedicated this morning so it's just gonna be a special day amen let's sing o come all ye faithful is the children get prepared [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh Oh [Music] Oh God [Music] [Music] [Music] the Shepherd training we all can go enjoy single niche must only nine [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] I was thinking one more no more all right they've got to go let's give him a nice applause as they go great inspiration on the little video that was really nice changed it up a little bit it's kind of fun you appreciate that hey men aren't these children wonderful they'll be sitting in your seat someday watching their children come up if the Lord tarries I can say that because this happened it's happened Amen let's give them another nice applause as they exit the stage I know I don't dare sing a song you're too distracted but it's a good distraction we need to appreciate the little ones that the Lord has given us and thus will turn the service to a brother Tom this morning and welcome Joseph and Naomi to bring their little one to be dedicated but Singh will not leave our little ones behind brother Tom comes will not leave our little ones [Music] [Music] [Music] may not be [Music] [Music] [Music] hey man how many can attest to that we're not gonna leave our children behind amen they are love gifts from God to us we have brother Joseph and sister Naomi Guerrero okay that's good and brother Joseph and sister Naomi God has blessed them with a baby boy and they the baby Joseph is 2 2 months 2 years 2 months old and I understand brother Joseph your father's here he's upstairs and we want to greet you this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus hey man Jesus took time and took the little ones up in his arms and so we're gonna take time as we get ready to hear the word of God this is a part of it and this little bundle of joy is named Joseph in the Bible or the Hebrew for the name Joseph means God will increase God will increase so I thought I would this this morning I took out of Genesis 39 verse 2 the Bible says and the Lord was with Joseph I want you to just to think about that the Lord was with Joseph and the Bible says he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian and the master saw that the Lord was with him the Lord was with Joseph he could attest to that and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand so Joseph has a tremendous connotation the son of prosperity and I want you to think about this sister Naomi and brother Joseph he was called the son of prosperity when he was in the pit and his brother sold him you say well that was not prosperous but we need to understand what God thinks is prosperous and what the people think that's prosperous he was in the pit he was prosperous Joseph was at Pont AFER's house who was a governor who was very wealthy and the world would say Punta fer was prosperous but not so the Bible says Joseph was prosperous yet a slave had nothing he was prosperous he went to prison and wherever Joseph went he was prosperous so what we call prosperous and what God calls prosperous we have to look this morning that this couple have named their child specifically Joseph the Lord will increase the prosperity of God is not in things or it couldn't be prosperous in the pit or in prison or in Potiphar's house the prosperity of God is the presence of God I want you to remember that brother Joseph for yourself for your child Naomi for this bundle of life the Lord has given you it does not matter whether it has a thing but if he's got God he's got everything he's a prosperous son because the Lord God is with him brother Branham said he's seen his life and begin to move and the next thing you find out that he's thrown in a hole deceived by his brother's supposed to be killed and thrown in a hole but he was taken up but Joseph foresaw that he saw himself in prison he saw himself in the dungeon he saw God was with him whatever he did he was the Prince of prosperity because God was with him the world might prosper in things brother Joseph but the world can't prosper without God everywhere Joseph went he was prosperous he was the Prince of prosperity may this Sun be the Prince of prosperity in this life and may the presence of God be upon him for brother Brown goes on to say for with Christ there is prosperity and Christ returns to earth all curse of the earth has taken away the deserts will bloom the rough places will be made smooth bring forth in abundance for he is the Prince of prosperity and I believe God's giving you the inspiration to name your son Joseph so prosperity spiritual prosperity is having the Lord and everything that you do having favor with God in all that you do and with this I would like to give you a scripture in Philippians two three and verse 20 but I believe all wrote for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we took we looked for our Savior the Lord Jesus and I looked up that word conversation is in heaven it means that we're a different people we're different because our citizenship is not on earth but our citizenship is from above Jesus believed he came from God and he's go back from God goes back to God the Prophet said we if we were ever in the mind of God to be eternal were going back to God God has blessed this home with Joseph the son of prosperity may he realize early that he's a citizen of heaven not just a citizen of Laodicea but he's a citizen of heaven he's come from heaven he goes back to heaven and he's eagerly may he eagerly if God should tarry look for the king of heaven may God bless this son brother Joseph sister Naomi let's pray father you bless this home with Joseph Lord his name means the Lord will give him increase may he increase in the presence of God increase in his life with God yes and may he know you Lord in an early early age the Prince of Peace mighty God the everlasting father may this son be born under Lord the great prosperity of God not in things but in the presence of God go with Joseph Lord she made the presence of God keep him watch over him and may there be a wall of fire all around him keeping him healthy keeping him focused Lord as a young boy looking to the king of glory we ask now that you bless him as we dedicate him to you Lord in Jesus name Amen no I'm amazed that he loves me let's stand as we welcome our precious brother David mayor my ear [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what a gift what a gift that has been given the bride of Jesus Christ of pardoning all our sin well this morning we have a special guest brother David Maher from Switzerland France where did we say it to us brother David has been a special blessing not only to here in Cloverdale but to those around the world he's been a friend he's been a soldier of the cross he's got a desire to not just rust out and do nothing but to burn himself up for the glory of God and be used of God I was picking brother David up on Thursday I was driving to the airport and I thought well I'll just listen to a tape as I'm I'm going in and I just got on my little phone and just downloaded the greatest gift and I thought well you know I'll just listen to that it's Christmas well I'm gonna I'm gonna listen to what the Prophet said the greatest gift is so as I was driving down the road and brother Branham was introducing the different people he says now I have a great friend he says a very very good friend that is here this morning from Switzerland I thought Lord I'm driving and picking up a very very good friend from Switzerland I thought Lord you're mindful of everything the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord and brother David is a pastor he's a man of God he has had a vision and has had these meetings in Switzerland now for 12 years brother David going on more and it's been a wonderful gathering of saints around Europe in Africa and we want to I want to thank brother David publicly for his labor and all the brothers that had labor with him to make these meetings possible and so now God has given us a gift of our dear precious brother to be here this morning we want to pull on that gift and and and may God give you a real present this morning and may the Lord unwrap that gift for you in the unveiling of his word amen god bless you brother David please have your glory good morning Saints I'm amazed that he loves me and I'm

children keep on giving praise to our Lord and Savior it was truly a blessing for us and well you know Satan he does everything he can to to block us to stop us a storm came by Satan his in for travel but here we are thank you Lord amen and you know all things work together for good I had the honor of staying with relative my sister Joanne and their home and now Satan he blocked there was no electricity and of course sister Johanna was a burden but in the night between Thursday and Friday as you know nine hours time difference you have a jet lag so I woke up and it was all dark but that's

whatsoever Amen I have a nine-hour jet lag Amen you hear locals but we want to give glory to the king of kings amen hallelujah so why are we standing if we can take take the Word of God Cloverdale we will drop some atomic bombs this morning because the word is atomic power is that okay amen let us take John 1 verse 1 say Amen when you're there in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men verse 5 and the light shine it in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not amen now let's take Genesis 1 verse 1 and I would like to read this verse with the revelation that God gave us brother Branham he says that God can mean it's it's an English word that I can have several meanings people make their piano of God make their car of God so brother Branham he says in the beginning Elohim a man because Elohim is the self existing one amen you piano your car or whatsoever they make God's they cannot be self existent amen so let's read it with that revelation so in the beginning elohim created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and Elohim said let there be light and there was light and Elohim saw the light that it was good and elohim divided the light from the darkness amen hallelujah may God add the blessing to the reading of his word let's have a word of Prayer our precious heavenly Father Lord how thankful we are father to be gathered here in your name Lord and Lord there's no other place we want to be but in your presence Lord and we know Lord you said there were two or three are gathered in your name that you are amongst us so father God we surrender to you and I pray Lord God may you take control over my body on myself father and may I be a vessel that you can speak to Lord I pray may you knowing the hearers of the word father because we won the word to produce in our lives father and I pray may you change us may you transform us Lord and Lord when we go back home later on father may we say it was good to hear you word oh and father wet burned when we heard a word of God it transformed us Lord because Lord we know you word is Almighty so may you take control over the service father although there are old those that are here those that are streaming father Lord you know the needs of each and every one father but Lord we want to give you all the glory and all the praise be certainly you are worthy to be praised bless Lord a pastor heal or the ministry father Lord a blessing they've been throughout the years Lord may you continue Lord and and keep them and guide them and bless them in all things father we pray and ask these things in Jesus Christ's name Amen and amen hallelujah you may be seated hey man so this morning a little Christmas message and for a title I would like to take let there be light and there is a man now we know that brother Branham he drew out the ages and how we know that we are living in the darkest age but we can focus on the darkest age but he has called us out of that so it's the most glorious age amen help me preach now amen Amon means so be it so let it be so Lord Amen and we know that Satan always tries to to to pervert everything we can look around and while I saw we were driving from the the Christmas concert going home and trees were everywhere and it was so dark powers were cut out it was so dark and that's Amen that was just with my natural eyes but spiritually everything is so dark glory be to God there is lights a man's talk now people because it's Christmas they want to put some natural lights I've seen houses I mean there are lights everywhere and so they want to brighten up their life that is so dark by putting natural lights aiming that but that's not the light I want to talk about this morning there is a real light a man that can shine Oh in no matter what situation that's the Christmas light I want to talk about a man so we know Christmas a man was now is another 25th of December a man like brother Branham says it's not the day it's the 25th of December it's a day we put aside amen because we realize a man he couldn't be born on December 25th lambs are born April or May amen but people and back home I don't know if the same here in Canada but yeah they like the story of a little Jesus being born and that's what it stays a little Jesus a little baby and we just dedicate a glory be to God a little baby so people they they they they they love little babies not realizing what was this greatest gift that was given to the world amen so we see that and it wasn't a 25th of December but he was born and now brother brownie says but I don't suppose that he cares what they we set aside because the actual day is lost anyway but it's a commemoration of his birthday so come let us adore him let us be glad and rejoice Amen joyful joyful how many are joyful this morning joyful joyful we adore thee we can sing it and we can have a face that is as sad as sad can be but joyful joyful we as RT amen amen so it's not I don't want to talk about a little baby in a manger aim but about God being made flesh amen the fullness of the Godhead bodily in him hallelujah Christmas should be a day says the prophet of worship mmm-hmm now let us worship our lamb hallelujah amen he's the only worthy one of all our praise so if there is any praise that needs to be given he deserves all our praise amen we know now through the reading of the word God created everything he created everything by spoken word let there be let there be let there be a man he created the angels name in God he is an object of worship God loves to be worshipped listen now when a king is born even there's usually singing when a king is born says brother Branham Amon but then there was no greetings here on earth people to greet him so the angels came down and sang thinking about those shepherds Amen walking with their sheep and now an angelic host coming down I'm bringing you good news amen we're gonna do a little travel here hey madam I'm bringing to our day later amen so the angels came down and sang rejoicing as today in the City of David is born Christ the Saviour gods and gellick hosts listen out who couldn't understand the mystery of this virgin birth but yet they sang and Satan can come around and tell you once you have the revelation of all the mysteries then I think you can start worshiping the angelic host never understanding this virgin birth but never the last day came down to worship the Saviour the king of kings goodwill to man Amon and they sing in his bird angels sang for the first time to human beings mm-hmm angels had never sung before to human beings and look at the choirs Oh hallelujah we saw some angelic little children singing here look at the choirs hey many many men whoa he continues saying brother Branham how they had stood and trained and trained those voices they'd sing at the bird of the Messiah Amon and they were all by pasts and angels came down and sang - who common sheepmen common Shepherd not clergy with clothes on but shepherds and look who got the first message for glory I can but rejoice amen be because he came to me as simple me amen if you if you're not unidentified I take it for me he came to me hey man so I want to certainly give him glory he didn't go to a cathedrals oh no but he went there to the Shepherd's in the wilderness hallelujah God revealing himself in humility how many can really say from the depths of their heart thank you Lord for bringing your message to me your reveal the world to me Amon not because I have a PhD or a doctor or this or that no no a sinner but saved by grace and he came to me hey man amen he revealed himself to us but now that was the first time is that okay my flight leaves tonight so we have all day and the church says amen hallelujah now we see that the Angels sang for the first time to human beings but there was a first time that angels ever sang at a celebration it's the Sailor prophet you know where that was it was in heaven and he refers to job job 38:7 job where was ow before I lay the foundation of the earth when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy we're without job you see the first time the Angels ever sang at a celebration it was in heaven Amen but the first time they sang to human beings was to the Shepherd's but where was Dow I'm asking you little pride where was the Amen before even the angels came down brother Branham tells it I was there I was there rejoicing I was there give him glory oh when he o exposed me to plan of redemption so come let us adore him we'll come let us adore him hallelujah amen amen there was worship before there was worship 2000 years ago and there's worship now on the earth a man not an emotion but true pure worship Haman reading the verses Haman about the birth of Christ Amon and the children sang about it when the Shepherd's received the message you know what they said let us now go even unto Bethlehem so we don't know where exactly there were but they received a message let us go if it takes us an hour two hours three hours let us go we want to respond to the world and in nowadays lukewarm age we become so lukewarm Oh service tonight I have to drive a half an hour to church even if I have to go to Cloverdale and if it takes me five hours I want to go and a door Jesus is Savior amen amen god loves worship hey man so that was worship before there was worship 2000 years and they're still worship amen amen you know there's power and true worship some people are against emotional and I'm not looking for emotionalism but believe me if your religion like Brenda Bram says don't have any emotion you have to change your religion an army when it goes to war they're not silent but now I'm speaking about an invincible army [Music] so we have everything to worship about because he's the great conqueror he is the great conqueror but he calls us the invincible army Oh hallelujah now it's not against the law correct me if I'm wrong it is not against the law here in Cloverdale here in Vancouver here in Canada to worship am i right but it is according to the word to worship him let everything that has breath praise ye the Lord amen there has to be singing says brother Branham he wouldn't have been sang to the people wouldn't have sang to him because they didn't believe him and that's the reason three little dots here it comes comma you might as well get it sorry brother Tom but here I go that's the reason today that people's ashamed to praise God they're ashamed of Christ I'm not ashamed of Christ he is my all he is my Savior he's my lord the reason that I never [Applause] [Music] hallelujah the great cathedrals won't receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost they're set in there a classy ecclesiastical way that they will not receive it but listen how God's going to find somebody that he can get praise through Lord let it be me who shall I sand letting me be the order I heard a brother say one time IRA I prefer to lose my voice praising God aiming and screaming for nonsense I'm not just screaming I want to tell my Lord and Savior how wonderful he is how great he is how much I love him hallelujah we'll let the worshippers arise let the sons and a daughter sing he is worthy of our praise a many many many man we want to worship Him in spirit and in truth I don't care my neighbor I don't care my mom I don't care my dad I personally want to praise my Lord and Savior when John saw in Revelation 5 a man he saw that no one was worthy he wept bitterly hey man but when the Lamb the perfect sacrifice Jesus Christ amen slain from before the foundation of the world when he stepped forward hey man and he's the only one who is worthy do you hear me he is the only one that is worthy sep 14 the seals there off the weeping became became shouting rejoicing oh he was having a Jubilee now what about us Amen with the greatest light that's ever been given come on now Oh hallelujah have a jubilee down in my heart a many many many many men how many love our Lord and Savior how much we can thank him because we have an open book I told the church back home hey I told him I said but what is the real understanding your understanding of an open book we can quote it but what is it really oh yeah the seals been open the book is open there has to be a true revelation Oh hallelujah let's talk about Jesus a many many many men and there will be a people on the land that will live the Word of God because said let there be and there is a man revelation ten a man now the angel say go take the open book so he opens the land they is the only one he goes opens the book now he tells John go take the open book John didn't need to go and beg he didn't need to go home please now John won't give me the book so some people think they have to beg and beg God doesn't want to keep the title deed for himself he gives it a man he gives us our inheritance Eamon but it's up to us by fate to step forward and say give me the open book hallelujah hello him said let there be light and there is mmm and I lo I love how the Prophet for some he's illiterate uneducated speaks bad or you know his grammar was bad but he could speak like a doctrine he could speak like a professor like a scientific he could go into the back parts of God's mind and how he exposed it he says let's just picture now as a little drama so you can get it so you can get it let's see now coming out of space where there was nothing let's make it a little white light like a mystic like like a halo and that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning that was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the Father that was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelled among us amen and he continues and says now see this is just like a child playing before the door I love it it was the son of God comma the logos and I can see him out there he spake and said let there be light and there was nothing something happens an atom I told you there's atomic power here in the Word of God an atom turned there and begin to were around this way and the Sun began to come into existence because he had said let there be now why do you quote that brother David just to show you the power of God's Word oh yeah I'm gonna nail it down amen we are here to destroy Satan's Kingdom this the smallest or the tallest no matter who you are we are here and bread it the brother Tom was quoting into the car even when the weakest of the saying goes on his knees oh hell is trembling amen amen amen so he continues there was nothing to make it from but he believed his own word and there was lights oh I see another play a piece fly off it's a meat-eor after a few millions a year or a hundred billions of years and people still scratch their head don't worry hello him said let there be and there is a man he goes another one flying of the Sun he goes on amen so here's brother Branham a man in the mind of God he's explaining what happened mm-hmm amen what is he doing writing his first Bible the human beings once looked towards the heaven he puts all the stars in the heavens the zodiac starting off with what the Virgin amen ending up with Leo the line the first coming of Christ second coming of Christ amen amen amen the Virgin in the line of the tribe of Judah amen so how is it possible brother David I don't know but there is and it's important we have a deep revelation of that mm-hmm because now I'm gonna bring it to us what the word says about us amen oh I'm so good that he said there will be a bride without spot or wrinkle I didn't say it brother Tom didn't say it brothers didn't say he said it let their a be Oh hallelujah now when did I start birth genesis said a man has written let there be a firmament in the midst of the water Simon I'm just gonna quote him rapidly but let her waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear he continues let the earth bring forth grass and it was good let there be foul fish and it was good so he continues let there be let there be and it was good amen and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth him on the earth so God created man in his own image the image of God created he him male and female created him now if we go a little further in Genesis 2:18 and the Lord God said so so far the creation it was good it was good it was good it was good now and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him help me for him God had already in his mind a bride so the whole creation was it was good but now it is not good because it has to be a bride now a word is a thought expressed now as I said before there is power in the Word of God never forget it children never forget it there's power in the Word of God amen Isaiah 55 says so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I send it so now in other words whatever God said will happen will happen let there be light and there is now brother Branham deals with that because let there be light says what if they wouldn't have been like we don't know whether he is God or not but because he just said let there be light and there wasn't see but now then God when God speaks and we see it is then that's the light that shines forth , the truth of the word that's when God speaks you see there is light and life and he continues saying it is God's spoken life my words are spirit and truth amen oh yeah yes God spoken life amen so whatever God says and whatever God does is perfect John 1:4 says in him was life and the life was the light of men verse five and the light shining and darkness and the darkness comprehended it not another translation says the light shines in darkness and the darkness has not overcome it oh I love that now light has a strength of power I was thinking I was getting ready to turn off all the lights but I won't go there but light has a power in it when I was in my room and Bretta tomes I had a candle it was dark amen it was dark but this little candle I found everything in my room I didn't bang into the wall the little light so no matter how little your light is and you think it is it is much more powerful than the darkness that is around you so stop finding excuses but I'm too small I'm too little my little line my this my dad no the smallest of the light forces darkness outside let there be light and there is a many many many many man Oh from the very beginning God wanted a light listen psalm 119:105 thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path now if God believe his own word what about that's the bride easy question but I hope you have a deep answer to that and say yes Lord so we have to believe the whole Word of God now God had a plan it's a Christmas message little Jesus God Himself amen but it's important that we don't forget that it's still God himself almighty all-powerful now God had a plan and he explains the natural woman Adams bright aim and maybe fell for Satan's scheme against the Word of God how how did he fell by reasoning it so let's let's not reason don't know I don't even try to reason believe only believe a man Eve fell from reasoning she fell from grace by listening to Satan's lie and her way we can say yeah that a man but you know what after God had her fortified behind his word so as soon as you started reasoning your vacation which is the word of God you're out of the fortification Eve was fortified she was protected she started reasoning boom she fell from grace if she had stayed behind a word she'd have never fell so if Satan can get you on one corner that's all he wants that's all he wants and Eve she believed so much of it but yet she missed it because you can believe so much of the Word of God and yet miss it you need to take hundred percent of the Word of God when gentlemen to take the book didn't say give me chapter one to five and I leave the rest eat the little book so you can become the little book amen so disbelieving the Word of God aim and now this first Eve fell God has the plan and this plan is perfect he is first he fell the second will not fall but why brother David did God allow all this sin to come in the earth that's easy because God send there's a prophet I'm gonna tell him what he said how could he ever permits him to come in the earth if it wasn't for a reason just to back up now some things that we have said he says what was first the Savior or the sinner the Savior sure which is more powerful a savior or a sinner why did he let sin happen in the first place to show that he is Savior why does he let sorrow come o to show us that there is a true joy why does he let the night come to show us that there is a real day a many-many man why does he let tamper come to show us that there is real peace I touched a sensitive core there and that's the piece we want and the only way to have that piece a menace to have Christ in you the greatest gift that was given hmm the devil listener who is stronger the darkness or the light the devil isn't omnipresent nor omnipotent

children to him he's but a devil boo devil like brother on would say boo devil now let's not reason the word today Amen God knows the end from the beginning a man and I can tell a man by the revealed Word of God Satan I've seen the back side of the book and you're lost you lost a man John 8:12 then spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of Life so there can be darkness upon the earth the darkest age we're living in but that doesn't mean I have to walk in the darkness he that followed me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of Life you know when brother Branham talks about you can create a world into existence now we put that all we're gonna create a world and it's gonna be like

been through but you don't know what I've been through and that doesn't matter if we serve God and he's a Living God you can be joyful cheerful in all things hey man now remember we are finite our minds are finite God is infinite a man an infant is perfect aim and God permitted it that he might project his love and power to the human race and when we are brought in the presence of the Lord Jesus at his coming there will be a million angels Oh hallelujah think of it there will be a million angels turn around the earth with bowed heads listening at the church sing the songs of redemption not knowing what they're talking about because they've never been lost a man they don't know what it means to be lost but you and I we know what it is to be lost hey man but thank God I am free free free from this world of sin hey man [Music] Loree glory glory glory he chose us in him before the foundation of the world this second Eve one fall it's impossible for her to fall he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it you're not worthy you'll never make it you're not one of them the word says he chose me before the foundation of the world you wanna you want to discuss with me mm-hmm go see my husband everyone says it's about time we talk to Satan not life if you believe the Word of God and

stay a man hallelujah and I'm on my way to heaven shouting to victory come on church I'm on my way to heaven I'm on my way if you're not identified that I am and the brother said Amen but I'm on my way to heaven shouting victory hallelujah now the world will not return void it will accomplish it is dust say the word of God now just to show you the power of the word of God if you want to follow is equal 37 the hand of the Lord verse 1 the hand of the Lord was upon me and carry me out in the Spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and caused me to pass by them roundabout and behold there were very many in the open valiant law they were very try what we are here the picture that is painted is now there are many bones and they're very dry very bad and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answered all Lord God thy knowest again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh ye dry bones hear the word of the Lord as I say the law of God at these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into and ye shall live have you ever thought I think all of you have seen a skeleton dry bones in class or in a museum wherever now how do you explain that dry bones can hear the Bible says hear the word of the Lord come on now God's Word can never fail no matter how many dry bones there are no many hands no matter how long they'll be laying there God said prophesy again amen whoo oh and there's a bride rising up on this earth amen breaking every chain Oh advancing with the name of Jesus amen but listen now a man samo when he went to find the next king he wanted to anoint the next king they all came but he anointed David now what about you you are anointed you've been anoint your under the Eagle anointing and God's Word will never fail it will never come back to me void without manifesting what I said says the Lord God prophesied over us there will be a bride without spot or wrinkle hey man God's Word is perfect listen now let's continue just took a few examples but God's Word is so powerful there's so many types in his word brothers and sisters listen up Ruth for verse 21 just to show you Boaz came from the lineage of Salman Salman was married to Rahab that's Ruth for 21 and salmon begat Bors Boaz begat obed if we look to Matthew 1 verse 5 it says in Psalm Bri got boys of Rahab and boys begat obed of ruth and obed begat jesse and JP begat joseph the husband of mary of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ so now humanly speaking how could Jesus come from a lineage like that I'm talking humanly now I'm gonna talk to spirit leap but that's how Satan comes how can it be a perfect lamb look to the lineage okay ready let's go a few years before when Joshua went to take Jericho there was Rahab she believed the word when they came this is nothing but the truth apply the token and when we will come and yes the city will be destroyed thou household you and thy household come on now mom's dad come on mom come on dad you and I household applied a token and they will be saved now Joshua gives clear instructions Joshua 6:21 and they utterly destroy all that was in the city both man and woman young and old and ox and sheep and ass with the edge of the sword in other words you destroy every living creature now coming back a few years later I can see the high priest standing before Rahab and sow into this holy estate these two persons present come to be joined if there is any person here that can show a just case why they should not be lawfully joined together in this holy matrimony do you now speak or from hereafter forever hold your peace they were all destroyed Joshua the great Joshua made sure there was no living witness and I'll Joshua took sure he made certain all others know nothing against our son holiday yeah wonderful Savior unto us a child is born Amen Jesus my Savior God for Danis predestinated us Haman and I believe his word hey man whatever God says I say hey man and God as we saw he wrote his first Bible in the skies and the stars amen and when God made his covenant to Abraham he points back to his original word Genesis 55 and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the Stars is that we able to number them and he said unto them so shall thy seed be god always points to the word brother Graham said back to the word because the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word of God cannot fail hey man what are you talking about brother David well there come a royal seed of Abraham amen I Abraham received a natural seed Isaac but he was talking about a spiritual Amon it was pointing to the super seat to come amen and that was Christ was God's Word made manifest now in Jove Achara now we are Abraham's seed if we are in Christ there are two seeds of Abraham one is natural the other one was Christ amen so if you are in Christ you have a super seat super to what Abraham wants because you come by the Royal seed come out Christ and if you're dead in Christ then you are Abraham's children and you have Abraham's seed and Abraham's faith come on now and [Laughter] Abraham's faith was in God's Word regardless of what took place he called those things which were not as is all they were you know why because God said so come on now bride because God said so there will be a bride without spot or wrinkle a many many many men now what is the definition of a believer how many believers do we have here to this morning wonderful wonderful brother Tom okay they don't know what the definition is now just quoting the prophet a believer is the fate of God that moves in you come on now I'm not talking about mental fate now faith comes by hearing hearing all the Word of God no reasoning no thinking out believing the Word of God he that is perfect came to take my place but to bring me to perfection God had a perfect plan before the foundation of the world and we are here in 2:18 close to 19 doing what manifesting his script brother Branham another quote say we are the actors on the scene I don't want you to be actors that's not what I am what I mean by that people they act all kinds of strange things no you live by the word you live by the word you believe the word you speak the word Amen that's the actor live by the word become the word eat the book to become the book Amen God came down to reveal himself to reveal all the mystery amen and the disciples asked Jesus why do you speak in mysteries Matthew 13 11 he answered said of them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven now I'm bringing it back to 2018 because it is given to you to know the mysteries that's why I myself and my prophet messenger to you a mouthpiece but to reveal the mysteries to you to you it is given to know the mysteries so we have no excuse now a mystery is a scripture it's a previously hidden truth now divinely revealed , but which is a supernatural element still remains despite the revelation oh where are you going okay very simple Abraham received the promise you will have a son he believed the Word of God Romans fork says and he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God you want to be strong and faith start giving glory to God God loves worship God wants us to hear him glorify His name so it's not emotion if you want to go a grow strong in faith give to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform and therefore it was imputed imputed to him for righteousness now the Scriptures were revealed to Abraham you will have a son he said amen Sarah we're gonna have a son he believed the word but a super narrow natural element remain what was it some lad morning he looked into the mirror and said I am changed that was the supernatural element but for us it's exactly the same you believe the word brother David how am I gonna be perfect Oh we'll tell you how you can be perfect Eamonn how I'm gonna be changed don't worry don't worry god knows what he's doing I shall be changed amen mortality will take on immortality Amon in the bye-bye world instead of fussing and trying to find out believe the word give glory to God hallelujah how can I be perfect very simple God looks through the blood of his son perfection comes by Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ only now let's take a little time to talk about perfection God was manifested was in his son Jesus Christ then he came to a virgin bird conceived by a virgin overshadowed by the Holy Spirit God Himself came down into a blood cell now again brother Brown he goes into such a clear explanation the scientists tried to find out but look he came down into a blood cell and wrapped the blood around him the blood cell coma the germ of life of God Himself wrapped in this blood cell that brought the son Jesus Christ now what does he do by that to make you perfect and to bring you back into fellowship and he brings you through that blood cell into himself do you get it says through the blood cell of the Lord Jesus what is that blood cell listen the blood cell of the Lord Jesus that in veiled the life of Jehovah you want to talk about little Jesus you can talk about little Jesus who but the life of Jehovah himself was in the little Jesus a many many many man God Himself created that blood cell a many many men and listen now he continues that in veiled the life of Jehovah comma and we can we say all together we we coming through the blood cell become a part of that life I'm gonna talk about atomic bombs so comma deity itself lays in the man that's received the Holy Spirit you are a son I'm a Branham by birth and a part of mr. and mrs. Branham isn't me and if you become a son or a daughter of God a part of Det lays in you he became me so I can become him I was guilty and so are we don't find excuses mine are smaller than yours and - we are all guilty and you know what only a judge can give a verdict that's right huh only the judge can give a verdict but glory be to God the great wig one came down and said taste this mr. Lawry the judge became my lawyer I was guilty also guilty but then he came down he said case dismiss brother branham said it's like you've never done it in the first place you want to know my first place way back in the mind in the back parts of God oh yes hey man and now I can only be perfect through Christ Jesus dropped the charges hey man we are under another covenant you are under another covenant my beloved I've loved you the wedding band is already slipped on the finger hey now Christ listen now we'll talk a little about predestination is that okay we think that here things happen we people say it happens by chance by no nothing happens by chance listen now into it right in the middle of the heart is a little place in a human being that isn't in an animal a little place where the soul is and Christ was speared through there so that the blood cell was pierced tore loose that blood cell and set the Holy Spirit at liberty for God to call through there and bring believers through the blood cell back into fellowship with himself again oh my he says through the washing of the water by the world therefore he alone is worthy of our praise happy Christmas blessed Christmas he provided a perfect sacrifice a man and we should remember Calvary every single day and Christmas should be a day of worship and now not only the 25th or the 24th and to you and to me and to us is given a way to come back into fellowship again so now the predestination this soldier thought just to make sure he's dead mm-hmm okay in the important bowls in ready for a bomb the flesh only veils the blood the blood is a life that's the only way to keep life in a body for the skin and a flesh and a tissues and the senior and so forth to hold the blood in their place so they can give life to this tabernacle that I'm dwelling in now that's what veiled God from mankind was the blood and the sinew and the skins of Jesus Christ the Son of God the unadulterated bird of his who god the father overshadowed the Virgin Mary and created in her the blood cell of his own being , the creation and in there his skin kept it from man so there was a veil like the Bible says which is his skin that kept it from man but one day the sin of man opened up his heart with a spear and his blood ran out in a manner his blood ran out on the ground it was given freely for the sins of the world and it's revealed today glory be to God it's revealed today and as that blood came forward also came to spirits and through the washing of the water by the blood through the spirit we are born into the kingdom of God now a little soldier thinking he's just going to make sure somebody's dead Oh hallelujah God's plan is perfect this spear went exactly on the right spot to make sure that blood cell was mob liberators set free why because way from the beginning he had his pride on his mind he wanted a way to bring her back to fellowship again glory when that blood cell because of sin was pierced yonder it freed God yonder the only thing between the mankind and Jesus God Almighty was the skin come on now so many people miss it so many people miss it but there's a bride chosen a man and she won't miss it hey man she hears the word she receives it and says Amen that's a the Lord amen now amen in the Old Testament if a man walked through that veil it was sudden death and it's that not to go through it now once where it was there to go in now it's death to stay out receive ye the Holy Ghost he was freed I love how brother Bram says it freed God yonder liberated hallelujah why was that for for me for you happy Christmas [Laughter] Jesus by one sacrifice perfected forever his church we are then perfect through Christ Jesus you've never done it at the first place you've never done it to begin with case dismissed brother David how can you say a thing like that I know I know my case I'm a hard case but God by His love and mercy he loved me before before I even was here but he said this is my beloved this is my beloved I choose you who come let us adore him hey man now listen God gave His light in this generation like never before he came down and opened a book all the mystery all the loose ends have been revealed why to reveal Christ what's the open ever revealing Christ revealing who he is and who we are now on August the 8th 1963 what a coincidence in 63 one of the biggest robbery took place in England millions were robbed Brad Abram on in turn on the light 64 says false light caused the greatest robbery in the world that the world ever had in England not long ago the greatest robbery that was ever performed was done by a false light 7 million dollar robbery is done by a full slide and slowed the train down and Scotland Yard couldn't find the men they got away so slicky Satan is so slicky be careful kids young people elderly Satan is so so leaky that was known as the greatest robbery that always was ever done by robbers and in the natural now this was in the natural they were playing with the signalling system they played with the signalling system that made the train to stop easy robbery they got away with it never knew where it was how and so on but now the greatest robbery that was ever done to the Church of Jesus Christ is done by a false light glare of some other age and rejecting the lights that predicted for this age a false light a glare of yesterday don't walk in the glare of yesterday walk in the warmth of the s oh and today don't pull yourself down into a denominational shade we need to ripen under that light let there be light and there is light what light the light of the s oh and the Sun hallelujah now there is power in that light you know that light can make dry bones live can make that a royal seed that's been laying there for years comes to life what poles it is light there can be layers and layers and layers and layers of concrete but that seed under the light of the sson will come forth it's not maybe perhaps know it will come forth a many many men now what's the matter it's caused the greatest robbery it's taken Christ from the church that's the greatest robbery of the church and remember the cold creed light will not ripen the seed of today so don't go back to another age God revealed his word to us oh it was so good in this age and it was so good in this age I want to live in my age what is my age bride age Lahori I want to ripen under that seed hey under that lights now Malachi for he is not the message he is the foreigner of the message what is the message Christ Christ is the message amen now that's why he came down he came down and took all the loose ends to reveal his true identity and our true identity and this message is perfect the Word of God is infallible God send us a son of man but revealing the son of man that's what it's all about brother says what's the opening door revealing Christ and now after the opening of the seals brother Branham says my Bible became a new Bible brother David it's getting complicated now no no it ain't because in the Bible there are so many types pointing back to the seals stop pointing back to the bride to Christ and the bride when God revealed a word this is like a new book ok let's take one example of Ruth and Boas is that still okay if you have a jet Lake stand up start worshipping you can sing a song Ruth and Boas which is a type of Christ and as a bride amen now we can see in Ruth she's gleaning in the field God has supplied a chief servant you can read it in the Bible Eliezer but in chapter 2 and I'm when I say early years of course I'm pointing to Rebekah but it was a chief servant in chapter 2 Ruth is introduced by the servant to the chief himself you can read it who's the chief himself her kinsman thank God for a servant in our age yes a wave sheaf we can't we can't we have to be thankful but now the Kingsmen says do not glean in another field you have found favor in my eyes the kinsman say don't know somewhere else my fortification is my word in my field your insecurity you have found favor the bible says grace in my eyes the kinsman's wants he wants her to stay in the field why to teach who he is so if you want to try elsewhere you'll never know who you are you'll never know who you are now after chapter 2 in Ruth there is no more mention of the servants because now it's time for Ruth and Boas in route 3:17 Ruth received six measures of barley six seals in 317 so route 317 and he said these six measures of barley gave him II and he therefore he said to me go not empty unto thy mother-in-law verse 18 then said she sit still my daughter until they know how the matter will fall for the man what a prophetic word for a man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this they what a type now the kinsman redeemer and now the seventh is what it's a secret there is silence for the world is what's going on what is it Boaz himself it's not a public show it's not for the whole public but there's an invisible union going on hey man and that's going on right now a man invisible union of the bride and the bridegroom where the world miss it a million miles away people will still even be quoting in ants but they didn't take the whole book so therefore they miss it but how thankful we can be a many many men why is there silence he's telling his secrets to his bride you are my beloved I chose you I love you hallelujah happy Christmas the message is about the bride because what is the world bride it's the manifestation of the hour what hour now this day the manifestation of this hour now you say ram ram in the Serpent's sea we got new light on it no you haven't that's what the devil come to Eve with some new light you don't need no new light you need to walk in the light that God's already put here that's all don't walk in the light of another age God gave us all the light we need you reveal all the mysteries there's not somebody to come no God is perfect and his word will never fail Webster says the glare is a false light like a mirage and that's what the devil is doing today showing people a mirage a Council of Churches over a group of denominations which will turn out to be false because there is a real light shining presence sister there is a real light shining that's why we can rejoice and adore Jesus our Lord and Savior a few more minutes is that ok now we know if it were possible Satan would deceive the very elect but if it were possible and it ain't boo devil as long as you fortified under the word as long as you are in Christ you fortified and you can say boo devil now listen but there will come false anointed ones hey that's a Bible oh brother David you know why did Lord allow this to show his glory like we saw in the beginning why did sin come to show that he's a savior why did sickness come to show that he's a healer amen he's still the same there will be false anointed ones and they'll call themself prophets mm-hmm but you will recognize them by the word no matter what they do they might heal the sick they might open the eyes of the blind and deny the word get away from it yeah but you know brother David I love that brother I read you know we have such a good relationship get away from it when they denied a word you stay away from it don't care what it is stay with the word regardless what it says what is the bride the royal seed the elect of God we were in his mind in his thoughts and now in very plain language you know that language the true Bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each one came at its time before you were born we dedicated baby I don't know how many days he had but before he even was born God knew all about him so no matter how old you are God still knows everything about you and we forget that we forget how mighty our God is and each member came forth and became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is we're speaking about the spoken word let there be and there is now this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride it's very apparent that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him listen now came from the same source that makes something special out of you brothers something special out of you all came from the same source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in many man bird body whereas once God was manifest in one member even our Lord Jesus how do you feel bride happy Christmas how thankful we can be God gave us an absolute what's the absolute the Word of God not my church not this church not this preacher not no no no no there's one absolute it's God himself now he said let there be light and there is brother Branham says in the greatest battle ever for the only thing that he's waiting for now is for his army to get their position come on now army of the Living God candies dry bones live come on now oh my ears no no no you've been prophesied over you are the bride of Jesus Christ without spot without wrinkle God provided a perfect sacrifice so that he could go and take the book and open a Caesar of and reveal you know the mysteries he's waiting when his army to get their position like the Stars the first Bible hallelujah their position let's take our position like the stars of heavens amen now we don't want to be wandering stars wonder if this is right wonder if that is right wonder if this will happen wonder if it could be don't wander stay like those stars of heaven as a real soldier as is post of duty stand there believing lorry be to God son they're believing come on bride let's take our stand as a real son and a daughter of God he said let there be and there is let's not put it on tomorrow or the next week or next year or I don't know when now stand and believe only believe all things are possible he says oh and there will be light in the evening time that's God who says there will be light in the evening time and let me tell you we're in the evening time there's not much time left we can see the signs all around us but rise and shine in the evening time there will be lights that's when come Christ the Holy Spirit Jesus comes down and set himself at the head of the church what a glorious time we're living in and he will resurrect his church being his own body and that's what is going on right now all over the world the Spirit is moving and all over the world there's an invisible union of the bride going on with a groom hey man David those songs I don't know don't worry they come by inspiration many will just continue and the bride will be gone already because they are not reflecting the light of the som didn't Jesus say in Saint John 15 I am the vine you are the branches and he gives an example the Prophet about an orange aiming and then he says if the vine ever puts foot another vine or not a branch sorry it'll be of the same live that's in it it'll bear an orange amen because at the beginning in the root it's an orange tree life he spoke the word let there be light and there is light Isaiah 60 verse 1 says arise stand stand like the stars in heaven arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth hey Manny can cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee is that your desire is that your desire then I have to decrease after this disappear I have this I have that know of nothing Here I am Lord but I gave myself away I give it all to you Lord that's a real Christmas brothers and sisters God will shine for his light he's doing it just for the coming of the Lord and it's not a man man is out of it it's God God does it because he promised it the Word of God will never return a void never forget it if we never see each other again we will see on the other side but the Word of God can never fail just like the word in the beginning I'm wrapping up now it was spoken in the Garden of Eden spoken word and the second time it was made flesh and dwelt among us and the third time it became part of us when the Holy Ghost is dwelling in us God coming into the man he spoke first the word the enemy tore it down then the word was made flesh and he was crucified but now there's a difference in the word the word has become the church and the church is the word you want to know the secret I know you've quoted many times the secret is the word is in the bride she's a spoken word seed bride the word is in the bride now just ripen under the light of the sol so that this seed all can produce and you know what it will produce nothing but the original huh huh you come from the same source how do you know it's God because he's taking the word so it's nothing my brother Tom ready John by the team not this church that church no no no he's taking the word what word his word and manifesting it isn't he wonderful now what time are we living in the Angels are all standing in order we talked about the angels coming down first time they sang to the humans first time they sang I had the celebration but now the angels are all standing in the order says brother Branham hallelujah the great corridors of heaven are crowded full the hearts are all in tune the great bands already practiced up there's a homecoming pretty soon for the Church of the Living God who has been waiting for his coming everything is in order I love that everything is in order with God there's nothing out of order your life isn't it out of order to your eyes it seems out of order to your eyes it seems a chaos God knows what he's doing then everything is ready everything is in order and I'm so glad and I'm waiting for that hour how many can say Amen - yeah the Angels already tune up hallelujah waiting for you and I homecoming time let us stand to our feet musicians 1 Peter 2 says you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show for the praises of him who had called you out of darkness into what into his marvelous light let there be light and there is light we have no excuse whatsoever a many-many man Oh hallelujah he has called us out of darkness into his light and God is light listen he was in the beginning here God is light he was in the beginning he is still the light he was made flesh went back to light and will be light till he comes in flesh and when he comes again the second time in the flesh then our bodies will be transformed and make like unto his and will be with him forever oh what a beautiful rejoicing thing that is who come let us adore him let us rejoice and be glad oh we have all the reasons in the world to rejoice because we walk in the light we walk in the light by our own doing no by our own merits no by the grace of God you can play walk in the light we walk in the light hey man that's why he says you're a city that sets on a hill a candle that cannot be put out you're the salt of the earth you're light of the world Jesus when he wasn't here on the yurt he did what he had to do but now the bride the bride has to do what she has to do Jesus said gave a clear
