[2:42] hey man let's stand to her fetus reading
[2:46] welcome brother David and heir to the
[2:49] pulpit he's a pastor from France who has
[2:53] brought his family here to be with you
[2:55] at this camp I think that's uh that is a
[2:59] great honor for us brother David to have
[3:02] you great honor it says something about
[3:05] the camp also that he would want to
[3:07] bring his children because we I believe
[3:10] he believes that the Word of God myth is
[3:13] ministered and it has an effect with on
[3:18] the lives of his young people and that's
[3:22] what we want young people will have
[3:24] activities this afternoon will enjoy one
[3:27] another and maybe the eating hall but
[3:30] now we've come to this meeting not just
[3:33] to put in some time but to hear what the
[3:36] mind of God has for us
[3:39] and if you are desiring something from
[3:42] God this morning last night was a
[3:43] tremendous move of God tremendous word
[3:47] and I want you to know as a man that had
[3:49] gave his heart to the Lord
[3:51] since he's 21 I'm 65 and it has not
[3:57] changed a bit it has only grown deeper
[4:01] and stronger
[4:02] I want more every day it doesn't stop at
[4:05] a camp meeting it goes on and on Lord
[4:09] show me yourself reveal your word I want
[4:12] to walk with you Lord that's why we have
[4:15] camps not just to give you a a nice
[4:18] little experience and then go home and
[4:20] forget about it but the Holy Ghost can
[4:23] come down transform your lives that you
[4:26] will never be the same again but you
[4:29] will never be lukewarm in a lukewarm age
[4:32] that there will be a fire burning within
[4:35] your soul that you can say burn on Holy
[4:38] Spirit burn within me let me be the
[4:41] Church of the Living God in this last
[4:43] age that's why we have camp that's why a
[4:47] pastor has a burden that we would have
[4:50] these grounds for these many years and
[4:52] you see these ones that are
[4:53] behind cameras and behind the sound
[4:55] moves they were in camp they were in
[4:59] camp they were sitting where you are but
[5:02] God's got a hold of them and they've
[5:03] moved on and now they're the support and
[5:06] they want you to have an experience what
[5:11] they have experienced and it's more than
[5:14] the frock it's more than the shouting
[5:17] it's a deep inner experience when the
[5:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost comes and
[5:23] lives within your soul how thirsty are
[5:26] you this morning I I want to put on my
[5:29] hands at Lourdes I'm very thirsty
[5:31] I'm thirsty for a great move of the Holy
[5:35] Ghost within my life I don't want to be

[5:40] pulpit but I can say truly Lord fill me

[16:38] thank you brother Tom hallelujah you
[16:43] know the Lord is so wonderful and so
[16:46] mighty and maybe you've heard it so many
[16:48] times but the mind of God is simply
[16:52] perfect as brother Tom was standing here
[16:54] not knowing anything about my notes
[16:57] Eamon but God knows and he knows what is
[17:00] needed for his people and as he was
[17:03] speaking he mentioned how thirsty are
[17:06] you that is my title this morning
[17:09] hey I'm under great expectation
[17:13] believers payment if the mind of God can
[17:17] tell brother Tom how thirsty are you
[17:19] there's a great blessing of God for us
[17:22] this morning
[17:23] hey man as for a subtitle I would like
[17:27] to take there is free refill that's why
[17:34] I'm saying that to everybody the
[17:37] youngest to the oldest
[17:39] there is free refill come on now so I'm
[17:44] asking you preach with me hey man when
[17:46] the warded word is being preached we
[17:48] want to water it with our pray say Amen
[17:51] that's beer amen so if we just reread
[17:55] songs and we see Haman David who was a
[17:59] man after God's own heart and if we look
[18:01] to his life we can say but he did some
[18:03] wrongs and he did dad but there was one
[18:05] thing he realized that he needed more of
[18:10] God he had a thirst in his soul my first
[18:14] my soul thirsteth after the Oh God hey
[18:18] man and today amen the greatest desire
[18:21] we should have it's not you just to have
[18:23] a nice camp activities can be great and
[18:27] believe me yeah I've seen many years
[18:30] been here many years the activities are
[18:32] great but what what is far more greater
[18:35] is a touch of the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[18:40] so that's all that matters amen so let's
[18:43] not focus on what will happen after now
[18:46] is the time to receive from God hey many
[18:53] man if you look to King David he had all
[18:55] he could dream of he had all the riches
[18:59] you can think of and in today's language
[19:01] we would say he was a very successful
[19:03] person hmm he's a great somebody cuz
[19:09] often that's what you know if you don't
[19:10] do this I all we hear that that person
[19:12] is a great somebody you know what the
[19:15] world calls great the Lord calls foolish
[19:20] mmm-hmm but David in you with all his
[19:25] riches oh his army that he could have he
[19:28] could never quench the thirst of this
[19:31] soul now the soul deepest thirst is for
[19:35] God Himself who has made us so that we
[19:39] can never be satisfied without him so no
[19:46] matter how much you try to quench that
[19:48] thirst with the things of the world
[19:50] you'll never be satisfied so we might as
[19:56] well be very clear this morning you will
[19:59] never be satisfied unless you quench
[20:04] that thirst with God everyone can say I
[20:11] need more of God everyone can see you
[20:13] and believe you but God he knows what's
[20:17] in your hearts desire you can fool the
[20:21] pastor you can fool your brother your
[20:23] sister your mom your dad but you don't
[20:26] fool God so let's take of our masks now
[20:32] and be Sisir before God let's not waste
[20:38] our time
[20:38] oh brother David I still got time I'm
[20:41] young I want to appreciate my life if
[20:44] you really want to appreciate your life
[20:45] run to Christ
[20:50] because he will come the word says in a
[20:54] twinkling of an eye so let's not put two
[21:00] tonight service tomorrow morning service
[21:02] or next week next year what you can have
[21:06] this morning hallelujah
[21:11] in this last age Satan he's very subtle
[21:14] oh he wants us to keep us away from the
[21:17] word and the power of God and he wants
[21:20] to trap us by all means now if we look
[21:24] to the natural brother branham he he
[21:26] spoke about the verse we read and he
[21:28] says as the heart panted for the
[21:30] WaterBrook so my soul thirst after deal
[21:32] God if that deer don't get the water
[21:35] he's dead and if you can get to Christ
[21:41] not the church the devil tries to put a
[21:45] force thing in you there tries to make
[21:50] you satisfied
[21:51] that great thirst in you by saying oh
[21:53] yeah I joined church I'm in Bible way
[21:57] I'm in this church they even English a
[21:59] ver now I'm this man of that church
[22:04] that's just almost as bad as doing
[22:07] something else I'm presbyterian
[22:09] I'm Pentecostal I'm Catholic I'm Baptist
[22:11] that dumb mean one thing to God you can
[22:15] be any church member and go to hell like
[22:18] a Martin in its box do you hear me so
[22:23] it's we're not I'm not talking to the
[22:25] church members now I'm talking to the
[22:28] royal seat of Abraham and enough is
[22:31] enough we draw the line
[22:36] except a man be born again he will in no
[22:39] ways wise enter in well I do this I do
[22:43] that I do the other you need to be born
[22:46] again to enter in God don't recognize
[22:53] anything else except a man be born again
[22:57] of the spirits and of the water he will
[22:59] in no wise enter in so it's a clear
[23:02] message believers brother David it's a
[23:06] simple message maybe it is but is a
[23:10] capital message that is the most
[23:14] important thing in our lives is the new
[23:18] birth hallelujah brother branham he
[23:21] tells a story of the about the dear Amen
[23:24] and he says now being a hunter I'm
[23:26] acquainted with deers and several of you
[23:28] are hunters you're acquainted with tears
[23:30] but I love it how he explains it he says
[23:33] hey man I'm acquainted with action of
[23:36] them and if you know it is as long as a
[23:38] deer can get to the water brother he can
[23:41] revive in a second there is something in
[23:48] a deer that when he gets to the water
[23:54] his wounds will heal mmm
[23:58] his strength comes back and there is
[24:03] something that is in you you may be hurt
[24:07] you may have scarves you may have had a
[24:10] miserable life so far don't you worry
[24:14] come to the water and drink their free
[24:18] refill and you will see strength coming
[24:22] back my scars being here
[24:25] so don't give me a cheap excuse my life
[24:28] that's my life that God is still the
[24:32] same this morning you know brother David
[24:37] I'm different really as the heart panted
[24:42] for the water Brooks oh my soul thirst
[24:43] after thee O God brother Branham says
[24:46] he's wounded the hounds of hell is after
[24:52] every one of you so your story ain't
[24:55] different brother David and I've seen
[24:58] and believe me some young people say oh
[25:01] you know I I go to these places but I
[25:05] know what I'm doing
[25:08] that's where Satan wants you to bring on
[25:11] his ground no negotiation I'm a son of
[25:14] God you're a son of God you're a
[25:15] daughter of God we don't need to
[25:17] negotiate we don't need to discuss thus
[25:20] say the Word of God
[25:22] payment so the hounds of hell is after
[25:26] every one of you he only wants to get
[25:33] you away from the shepherd once mmm oh
[25:40] you know it's only Wednesday night
[25:42] service I think I'm gonna skip Wednesday
[25:44] night service you're listening to
[25:48] Satan's subtle lies you know brother Tom
[25:54] brother it's only one service one
[25:56] service can be enough one service can be
[26:01] enough that's why this camp is this is a
[26:05] celebration camp because there's freedom
[26:09] when the word is being preached Amen we
[26:12] want to embrace the word and said that
[26:14] is for me I say Amen and I don't want to
[26:18] listen to the lies of Satan anymore amen
[26:23] that's what brother Brown says he only
[26:25] wants to get you away from the shepherd
[26:27] once oh so don't play that game
[26:33] oh that dear he has to find WaterBrook
[26:37] or perish Oh God he says let that be our
[26:41] soul today from the back to the front
[26:46] let that be our soul today wounded if
[26:52] you can't find a what a Brook the hounds
[26:54] will get him pretty soon but if you can
[26:56] only find out water if we only can get
[27:04] that kind of life sis brother branham
[27:06] blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[27:08] after righteousness for they shall be
[27:11] filled
[27:13] may not be the motifs of this church
[27:16] this morning can we say Amen
[27:20] Sudan may not be our motives this
[27:22] morning
[27:23] amen amen amen may our affections be
[27:26] turn away from the things of the word
[27:28] the cares of the world and let's focus
[27:32] on him how thirsty are you there's free
[27:38] refill the hounds of hell is right
[27:44] behind you
[27:45] crippled and wounded by sin you see only
[27:48] get away once from the Shepherd and you
[27:50] will be crippled wounded because the
[27:54] hounds of hell are behind every one of
[27:58] you brother David what a message well I
[28:03] want to get you out of this risky
[28:07] situation where you think you're smarter
[28:10] than God
[28:12] the hounds of hell are behind each and
[28:16] every one but glory be to God there is a
[28:19] fountain oh where we can drink freely a
[28:23] many many many men now we've got to find
[28:26] Christ or perish and when that sort of a
[28:29] desire gets into a man's heart he will
[28:32] find Christ when you get into that shape
[28:34] and that's what these meetings are all
[28:36] about when we get into that condition
[28:39] where it ain't the games that matter
[28:42] we're the only thing that matters is
[28:45] Christ when the brown tabernacle pitched
[28:51] through that place
[28:54] the little isms will drop out the doors
[28:57] the differences will all be settled out
[28:59] and Christians will be Christians we
[29:03] heard reddit and preach there's no place
[29:06] for sissies brothers are brothers
[29:09] sisters are sisters
[29:11] we don't want to be shaped after the
[29:13] world I want to be safe according to the
[29:17] word Christians are Christians oh and
[29:25] this will be I love it and this will be
[29:28] a spot that'll be talked of around the
[29:31] world when any congregation of people
[29:34] will thirst for God in that manner come
[29:38] on say sir let us search for God in that
[29:41] matter brother David wha what are you
[29:44] excited about what am i excited about I
[29:47] had a life-changing experience amen and
[29:50] it's burning inside of me and my prayer
[29:53] is for each and every one of you you
[29:55] have the same experience that baptism of
[29:58] the Holy Ghost
[29:59] oh you walk will be different you'll
[30:01] talk will be different your songs will
[30:03] be different your price will be
[30:05] different if you want a reality
[30:14] how desperate should we be when you get
[30:17] to a place that you want Christ so bad
[30:19] you must have him or perish you can't
[30:24] sleep at night not because we want to
[30:27] talk about this song or about that movie
[30:30] about this or about that come on now
[30:34] you can't sleep at night a many men you
[30:37] can eat you've just got to find him
[30:45] blessed are you when you hunger and
[30:47] thirst after righteousness because
[30:50] you'll find eternal life hello how
[30:54] brother Branham says it when the church
[30:57] gets to that place that is got to find
[31:00] Christ or die
[31:07] till not until that time I say enough is
[31:16] enough enough is enough we don't want to
[31:21] have another camp meeting we want a
[31:26] revival to break out amen so the way to
[31:30] have a revival is to be so desperate so
[31:33] thirsty
[31:34] oh brother David I've been blessed three
[31:37] weeks ago five years ago did you lose
[31:41] your thirst David being such a rich man
[31:45] he said my soul thirsteth after deal god
[31:51] that's what Satan wants to bring into
[31:54] your mind I'm satisfied so young people
[32:00] how did you come to come this year maybe
[32:03] you've never seen brother David that
[32:05] doesn't matter at all I mean nobody try
[32:09] to tell everybody about somebody who can
[32:11] save anybody come on now I'm determined
[32:21] to receive from God it's a matter of
[32:23] life or death
[32:27] Romans 8 says for we know that the whole
[32:30] creation groaneth and travaileth in pain
[32:33] are we groaning are we desiring so much
[32:36] more of Christ Webster says it's a
[32:42] painful desire first thing for God
[32:46] should be such a now brother David do I
[32:49] have to have pain the there if it
[32:52] doesn't get to the water it dies and
[32:56] believe me brothers and sisters if you
[32:59] don't get to Christ you die you can be
[33:05] as somebody in school you can be as
[33:07] somebody at work but that has no
[33:10] importance I want to be christ-like
[33:17] we know we live in laude sear Amen so
[33:21] it's a dry and desert land lukewarm I'm
[33:27] in the message for so many years has the
[33:32] message become common to you I've been
[33:36] to church all my life has it become so
[33:38] common that we lost our thirst for quote
[33:41] for more of God forbid Satan tries to
[33:49] fill you with its filth he tries to
[33:51] replace that thirst with all his dirt we
[33:55] live in an age where we have so many
[33:58] varieties of drinks when you go to the
[34:04] grocery store you found hundreds and
[34:07] hundreds and hundreds of drinks it's
[34:09] amazing that's the natural but Satan
[34:15] brings you all kinds of drinks all kinds
[34:18] of filth to satisfy your thirst
[34:23] now do you know that all drinks no
[34:26] matter what it is
[34:27] soda tea coffee juices they have one
[34:31] thing in common that is water
[34:35] redbull there's water in it I know some
[34:42] of you brothers drink that that's the
[34:47] only pour pure thing amen amen and we
[34:50] see in the world that is the thing that
[34:52] is lacking scientists say that in 2050
[34:57] we will be lacking drinking water
[35:00] believe me I'll be gone
[35:07] in a desert in a dry and country land
[35:13] everything is Fric ly starchy and that's
[35:18] what the people are without the baptism
[35:21] of the Holy Ghost they become Sparky
[35:24] correctly you preach the article but
[35:36] wait until that satisfaction comes the
[35:40] satisfaction portion of the fullness of
[35:42] the Holy Ghost comes and then the joy
[35:45] Belsen wolf shouting will ring amen let
[35:50] the bells of victory sound very clear
[35:53] because there is victory in the camp let
[35:58] us prophesy again it is joy unspeakable
[36:06] and full of glory when you full with God
[36:12] you can't be starchy you can't sit still
[36:16] ransom when God does something for you
[36:18] oh yeah you will shout and scream I'm
[36:21] not talking about emotion hey man I love
[36:24] how Joshua and the skits he said Haman
[36:27] when we go this time around the walls I
[36:30] just don't want any worship god bless
[36:34] you brother Joshua was it Marco I think
[36:36] it was huh yeah brother Marco god bless
[36:38] you I don't want any with any kind of
[36:40] worship I want to worship from the soul
[36:44] Haman and our Joshua tells us this
[36:47] morning when you hear the word of God
[36:50] I want to respond to that word
[36:53] say let it be so Lord amen glory be to
[36:56] God if Jehoshaphat would praise God Amen
[37:02] when he heard the word of God Amen he
[37:04] praised her and God fought the battle
[37:07] what about us this morning he is still
[37:10] the same the great God Jehovah a many
[37:14] many many men has brother Branham he's
[37:17] continued saying has he become the very
[37:18] fountain of your life or are you trying
[37:23] to push him away and satisfy your
[37:25] longing with a list of the world or any
[37:27] other trick of the enemy are you trying
[37:32] to satisfy this longing by joining a
[37:34] church and neglecting the great
[37:36] spiritual birth which is the only remedy
[37:40] that you can be saved by there ain't no
[37:44] shortcuts
[37:45] there ain't no deviations there's one
[37:48] way be ye born again hallelujah
[37:54] now what happens if a buddy deer comes
[38:04] around that's how brother branham calls
[38:07] it if you're not a buddy deer comes
[38:11] along and says you know I know where
[38:15] there is a mud hole down there and if
[38:20] you've got somebody's so-called buddies
[38:27] if those buddies take you away from the
[38:30] Word of God there are nobody
[38:37] brothers and sisters oh you know it's
[38:40] just for wanan and i know i know my
[38:42] position be careful
[38:44] Satan is subtle he ain't a buddy dear
[38:48] there
[38:48] he's a trick of Satan trying to trap you
[38:54] we don't want to go through a mud hole
[38:56] we won the pure water of God aimin ho
[39:01] and there is nothing that can satisfy
[39:04] that thirst that is in a human being
[39:07] until God comes in you must have it or
[39:11] die and no persons has a right to try to
[39:16] hush or satisfy that holy stirs that is
[39:19] in him it's ungodly to do so if you're
[39:26] thirsting for God there's only one thing
[39:29] that can satisfy it that's to meet God
[39:32] that's what these meetings are all about
[39:35] well brother brother David yesterday was
[39:38] wonderful and it was but don't listen to
[39:46] the reasoning of Satan saying oh I had
[39:49] my blessing yesterday there's free
[39:52] refill
[39:56] you know us Europeans when you go to a
[39:59] restaurant you pay for a coke there's no
[40:02] free refill so the first time years ago
[40:05] I came here free refill ask my kids free
[40:09] refill oh that's the natural what about
[40:13] the spiritual there are so many
[40:16] blessings for you how thirsty are you
[40:26] now brother branham he warns us and he
[40:29] says if you're thirsting for God be sure
[40:32] it's God you found he's warning us here
[40:36] now that's Satan the hounds of hell are
[40:39] behind us and you can be sincere
[40:43] yeah I'm thirsting for God but Satan
[40:46] will come and try to give you something
[40:48] to satisfy that thirst be certain you
[40:52] found you find God okay he will simply
[40:58] try to make a way so that you're
[41:00] satisfied don't be satisfied unless you
[41:05] have Christ unless you have a born-again
[41:08] experience now we don't want to take
[41:14] that lightly our attitude determines the
[41:17] results Satan will do all he can to give
[41:21] you mind battles he'll do all he can to
[41:24] stop you from coming to Christ remember
[41:27] those that were there last Sunday about
[41:29] this plane it is a struggle amen to
[41:32] reach that barrier once it gets beyond
[41:34] the sound barrier so I know several of
[41:39] you were here at the altar and there's a
[41:42] great battle going on when the world is
[41:45] being preached but the word is still
[41:47] Almighty
[41:49] Menem but satan he will come and say no
[41:52] don't go to the altar you don't need to
[41:56] go to the altar and what if what if
[41:59] brother tom or brother ed sees you going
[42:02] to the altar what does it matter the
[42:06] deer has one desire it needs to find
[42:10] water or it'll die so no matter who or
[42:15] what may think anybody I want to come to
[42:20] God for more of him don't let Satan play
[42:27] with your mind we run to Christ God
[42:33] still gives us the opportunity to run to
[42:36] Christ to be filled with him how thirsty
[42:40] are you mm-hmm now we see that Satan he
[42:47] tries to prefer to pervert dissatisfying
[42:50] on the soul that thirst of the soul he
[42:53] tries to give you everything to satisfy
[42:56] it
[42:56] hey man and it continues everything is
[42:59] perverted right ready Tim gave us stats
[43:03] I was blown away
[43:05] he gave us stats that's reality so
[43:10] there's nothing in this world there's
[43:12] nothing that Satan can give you to
[43:15] satisfy your thirsty soul but what is
[43:20] being preached here is nothing but the
[43:23] Word of God the pure Word of God that's
[43:27] the only thing that can satisfy your
[43:29] hungry soul so Satan perverted
[43:34] everything he has perverted so gradual
[43:36] until it's become the most deceitful age
[43:38] age that any human being ever lived in
[43:43] so it is a dry and there's a place this
[43:47] scripture applies to today completely
[43:50] dry oh yeah people can do all kinds of
[43:53] things but they're so dry so dry blessed
[44:01] are we believers to be sitting in his
[44:05] presence let's never take that for
[44:08] granted
[44:09] never take the Word of God so it's
[44:12] common to me now we know there's a
[44:19] control tower of the soul then there's
[44:25] one for the body and many times these
[44:29] warr one against the other
[44:32] what's the great trouble today too many
[44:36] people try to live between those two
[44:38] desires you cannot be sitting on the
[44:41] middle of the fence where it's hidden
[44:43] remember this either you serve God or
[44:47] you serve Satan there's no in-between up
[44:53] to us to choose how thirsty are you
[44:55] thirsty a natural thing it's just simply
[45:04] something that God has given us given a
[45:08] desire and that's the control there's a
[45:11] control tower to that desire and this
[45:15] ters this control tower that sets where
[45:17] energy in the man's heart is something
[45:20] something that God gave him to warn him
[45:24] of the desires that is needful for him
[45:32] what is needful not what you think
[45:36] that's where Satan's playground is
[45:38] that's the control tower I want to
[45:40] listen to that's what is needful for me
[45:46] give me more of you Lord Jesus
[45:48] I'll have lujah and we know the story
[45:51] about the Indian a man that says I have
[45:54] two dogs in me a white one and a black
[45:58] one
[45:58] Roy brown says oh yeah and which one
[46:01] wins the battle I want to do right and
[46:04] doing wrong and there's a white and a
[46:07] black dog so the chief says what matters
[46:10] is the one that I feed the most mm-hmm
[46:14] so little bride what are you feeding on
[46:17] feeding on Facebook Twitter Internet
[46:21] films snapchat all this chunk of satan
[46:26] it is brother David we heard preach
[46:32] against it same tries one thing to get
[46:36] you away from the Shepherd only one time
[46:39] he's the great Shepherd he is the great
[46:42] Shepherd so he gives all this chunk to
[46:46] keep you busy I think I mentioned it
[46:49] last last meeting busy means being under
[46:53] Satan's yoke or are you feeding on the
[47:02] unfailing body Word of the Son of Man
[47:04] that's what matters
[47:08] that's all that matters to be filled
[47:11] with him and him alone the Word of God
[47:13] tells us that we we must be born again
[47:15] there is no other way brother David you
[47:18] know my character my past my family I
[47:22] was born so-and-so and it's true I don't
[47:25] know what will you families but brother
[47:29] branham he gives us an example in a
[47:30] paradox he says now the genes in the
[47:33] father and the mother of this boy no
[47:35] matter how much they are converted still
[47:37] remains the flesh that's been
[47:38] interviewed out to this boy therefore
[47:42] the boy has got a complex in him
[47:44] listener just like from his mother's
[47:48] family and they are not forgiving they
[47:54] will not apologize
[47:56] and that's where that boy stands I said
[48:02] to the father
[48:02] no no matter how you've raised him up
[48:05] now look at your family to the mother
[48:07] there are a bunch of people they're very
[48:10] independent
[48:11] irreverent to religion hmm you're the
[48:17] only one of all your sisters then he
[48:19] says brother branham talking to the
[48:21] mother of all your sisters and brothers
[48:23] and you are sweet kind and forgiving
[48:27] what does that so don't give me the
[48:32] excuse my mama's like that my dad is
[48:35] like that brother Brandon said I'm the
[48:37] son of yeah my father he's an alcoholic
[48:43] Satan will give you all kinds of excuses
[48:46] but don't give me excuses take the Word
[48:51] of God what Mesa you're sweet you have
[48:57] received the Holy Ghost
[48:59] that's the thing that made you tender
[49:02] and sweet it's not your people anymore
[49:05] it's your Christ that lives in you then
[49:10] I said to the boy look at your family
[49:13] practically all of them are drunks and
[49:15] so forth and how Moody and high tempered
[49:19] and high-strung he talks to their father
[49:23] now but you're not you're kind of
[49:25] forgiving what is it
[49:27] the Holy Spirit you'll know more what
[49:30] you are its Christ in you and he
[49:35] continues now he brings it to their
[49:37] their son now and I'm bringing it to you
[49:39] all now now that same thing has to
[49:45] happen to your son
[49:51] the father says oh I know my son he went
[49:54] to the altar we baptize him in the name
[49:56] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:58] brother brand says that maybe all right
[50:01] all the outward motions he might be
[50:04] identified as a believer with the
[50:06] believers but until he is regenerators
[50:09] born again I'd advise that young man to
[50:13] never marry a woman he'll make hell
[50:16] honored for her until that gentle sweet
[50:19] forgiving spirit of Christ comes in
[50:23] [Applause]
[50:27] that's all Lee the only thing that
[50:31] matters is for him to come in until
[50:39] Christ comes in then he continues to say
[50:42] in his intellectual she's trying his
[50:43] best to overcome he can do it that's
[50:50] strong he can do it because the battle
[50:53] is the Lord's listen how he never
[50:56] overcome it Dave it ain't on him Christ
[51:02] will have to overcome it when he lets
[51:06] Christ in then he's already overcome
[51:11] then so just let Christ come and amen
[51:16] and you see a life your life being
[51:18] completely changed brother John will do
[51:26] things a little different today it's
[51:32] calm
[51:41] brother David
[51:43] what do we have here a vessel the Bible
[51:49] talks about there are vessels of Honor
[51:53] and I refer to 2 Timothy 2:20 or Romans
[51:55] 9 21 there are vessels of Honor and this
[51:59] honor I want to be a vessel of Honor so
[52:06] here we have a vessel and inside yes
[52:10] there are ping-pong balls but they
[52:12] represent something to Timothy 3:2
[52:17] speaks about the last days how the
[52:20] people would be and we heard last night
[52:23] that all these little things you can
[52:26] call them little but a little demon is a
[52:29] demon so all this is what lovers of
[52:37] themselves covetous boasters proud
[52:45] disobedience and thankfulness I just
[52:48] wrote a few down here heading it while
[52:51] brother David I don't have all this
[52:52] inside of me don't worry we'll come to
[52:57] it
[52:59] jealousy rebellion lust selfishness
[53:04] hot-tempered aggressive bitterness
[53:08] complexes frustration social-media
[53:11] addictive stubbornness religion spirits
[53:20] okay that is the vessel and now there
[53:25] can be only one ping-pong ball in the
[53:29] vessel or many there is only one remedy
[53:36] that is to be filled with the water of
[53:41] God
[53:43] so now what happened Satan is subtle you
[53:47] go to church I felt good brother Tom
[53:52] listening to the word it was good it was
[53:57] very good and I went last Sunday I think
[54:02] I'll stop hmm nothing happened nothing
[54:11] happened brother Tom they told me to
[54:13] come and hear the word and nothing
[54:16] happened
[54:19] subtle sing but let me tell you stupid
[54:23] Satan what we need to do is to continue
[54:32] every good thing is good as long as we
[54:37] keep on doing it if you want to go
[54:40] strong grow strong is read your Bible
[54:45] pray everyday that you may grow strong
[54:52] so okay brother David I continue as long
[54:57] as you keep you know feeling on the Word
[55:01] of God normally something should happen
[55:06] something should happen
[55:08] hey that's what it they were stuck sorry
[55:13] so if you keep on feeding on the Word of
[55:16] God what will happen is all these
[55:21] ping-pong balls representing now I'm
[55:24] gonna help because of the heat they were
[55:26] stuck you see they're coming that's what
[55:34] we need
[55:36] listen now Satan will come around and he
[55:41] will tell you you ain't what you what
[55:45] you were that's Loudy see ya
[55:48] you become lukewarm because they're
[55:51] still if I ask anybody in the back what
[55:54] do you see do you see that part here
[55:57] thank you brother
[55:58] I don't know who said no you still see
[56:02] ping-pong balls here but keep on
[56:05] drinking of the fountain that never runs
[56:08] dry and what happens they will all go
[56:13] out I'm helping now for the sake of time
[56:16] listen the good thing I love that part
[56:29] now you don't see any more orange do you
[56:32] the good thing is when you filled with
[56:35] Christ Satan will come around you know
[56:40] he can try but he can only stay on the
[56:44] surface the Word of God tells us resist
[56:48] the devil and he will flee from you so
[56:51] that's the good news brothers and
[56:53] sisters Satan can come around but unless
[56:56] you fill with his presence
[56:59] Amen he has no more impact on you and
[57:03] that's what these meetings are all about
[57:06] [Applause]
[57:14] Brennan says water is Christ his holy
[57:18] spirits in the message a prisoner a
[57:26] prisoner brother relative mentioned
[57:29] prison is protection I'd like to make
[57:36] this statement God always has to take
[57:38] any man that will serve and truly to be
[57:41] his prisoner
[57:42] a man has to surrender every ambition
[57:45] he's got everything that he is
[57:48] everything his life soul body will
[57:51] ambitions and everything else and become
[57:54] a complete prisoner to Christ who is the
[57:57] word to serve God God is looking for
[58:02] prisoners he's always done it you might
[58:09] searches through the scripture the man
[58:11] has to be a prisoner to Christ against
[58:13] anything therefore you cannot be
[58:16] connected with anything but Christ and
[58:20] here we are living in a connected age
[58:26] some of you have two phones or a mobile
[58:30] phone and iPad sorry or any kind of pad
[58:38] but what matters here you cannot be
[58:42] connected with anything but Christ then
[58:48] God can use you until then he can't when
[58:55] God gets you to be his prisoner then you
[58:58] can do nothing but what the Spirit says
[58:59] do Paul with all his great aunt elects
[59:05] he was taught by Gamaliel to be a great
[59:09] priest or Rabi some day and he had high
[59:13] ambitions so it is great intellect he
[59:17] still needed the fire of God
[59:22] you know what fire is still the oldest
[59:27] type of sterilization and we need the
[59:32] fire of the Holy Ghost in our lives to
[59:36] burn out everything that is contrary to
[59:40] his word now he had high ambitions
[59:46] you know ambition and adoption begins
[59:51] with the letter A but adoption is the
[59:56] ambition of God for you so my ambition
[1:00:01] here has is none importance I want to be
[1:00:08] connected to Christ he was
[1:00:12] intellectually a great man great
[1:00:14] authority great man in the nation but he
[1:00:16] had to sacrifice every bit of it to
[1:00:18] become part of God to express Jesus
[1:00:21] Christ Moses his intellectuals he had to
[1:00:25] lose them in order to find Christ so
[1:00:27] don't come with Europe high-minded
[1:00:30] intellects or you artificial intellect
[1:00:33] that's now the daily thing you're gonna
[1:00:40] write some algorithms and you know oh

[1:00:46] believe me artificial intelligence if
[1:00:50] you ask the question can a man walk on
[1:00:52] water
[1:00:53] no because the law of gravity says that
[1:00:57] you will sink but hey let me talk you
[1:01:01] about my Lord Almighty therefore you
[1:01:05] cannot rely on your intellect you cannot
[1:01:08] Lyonne artificial intelligence hey man

[1:01:22] Moses he had to have a life-changing
[1:01:25] experience
[1:01:26] amen amen and it's only when he got that
[1:01:29] experience Haman when he met the pillar
[1:01:31] of fire that he could go out amen and
[1:01:35] call for flies and flies came into
[1:01:38] creation because he had a prisoner that
[1:01:41] Pharaoh couldn't pay off with nothing
[1:01:45] Satan will come around and try to pay
[1:01:48] office why don't you come you'll be

[1:01:57] fashion clothing yo-yo fashion clothing
[1:02:03] junk clothing yeah I want to been
[1:02:08] connected to Christ so I don't want to
[1:02:14] be paid of by anything
[1:02:17] fara couldn't pay off with nothing
[1:02:19] nobody else could turn him no way he was
[1:02:22] a complete prisoner in the chains of
[1:02:24] God's Word bound up only to us said the
[1:02:29] Lord the people were all the same
[1:02:35] but when Moses saw him after their
[1:02:40] experience with the pillar of fire what
[1:02:44] did he see I'm asking you the question
[1:02:47] what did he see he saw a free people and
[1:02:56] this morning I see a free people in
[1:02:59] front of me I respond to the Word of God
[1:03:02] that our first thing in their soul in a
[1:03:06] dry
[1:03:07] and but they hear the word and they come
[1:03:10] drink and drink and drink to be
[1:03:13] completely filled with this power fair
[1:03:17] so only slaves fair every morning so
[1:03:23] only slaves but Moses saw there's
[1:03:29] victory in the camp and there's victory
[1:03:32] in this camp Haman thus said the word of
[1:03:36] God hey man he is still the God that
[1:03:39] delivers he says till the God that fills
[1:03:42] that seals with the Holy Ghost yeah
[1:03:47] that's God's plan for his bride
[1:03:50] God sent in our generation a prophet a
[1:03:53] many many men and God said Melchizedek
[1:03:57] went to meet Abraham and Sarah
[1:04:00] he gave them a message Laurie that
[1:04:06] message transformed their bodies and God
[1:04:09] gave us a message let that message never
[1:04:12] become common to us because that's the
[1:04:15] Word of God that is transforming us this
[1:04:19] word is transforming me changing me
[1:04:22] molding me into his image revelation 21
[1:04:30] and he said unto me it is done I am the
[1:04:31] Alpha and the Omega the beginning and
[1:04:33] the end I will give unto you and to him

[1:14:27] good news there's free refill I'm soon
[1:14:35] gonna be closing now how many know the
[1:14:37] story about a young man Glenn Cunningham
[1:14:42] anybody heard that story if you have
[1:14:48] good repeating it new this man young man
[1:14:56] they called him also the Kansas flyer
[1:14:59] this little boy he went into a country
[1:15:03] school house and it was heated by an
[1:15:06] old-fashioned potbelly coal stove and
[1:15:08] this eight-year-old boy named Glenn
[1:15:10] Cunningham had the job of coming to
[1:15:13] school early every day so that he could
[1:15:16] use kerosene to start a fire and warm
[1:15:18] the room before his teacher and his
[1:15:20] classmates arrived so every day
[1:15:23] he ran to school to heat up the school
[1:15:25] the class now one day somebody had
[1:15:33] changed the container of kerosene and
[1:15:36] used and fill it with gasoline and
[1:15:39] disaster struck
[1:15:41] the class and the teacher arrived to
[1:15:43] find a schoolhouse engulfed in flames
[1:15:46] terrified on realizing that Glenn was
[1:15:49] inside there rushed and then and managed
[1:15:51] to drag him the unconscious little boy
[1:15:54] out of the flaming building he had major
[1:15:57] burns all over the lower part of his
[1:16:01] body he was brought to the hospital the
[1:16:05] doctor told his mother that her son
[1:16:06] would surely die which was for the best
[1:16:10] really for the terrible fire had
[1:16:12] devastated the lower half of his body
[1:16:14] but that brave boy didn't wanna die
[1:16:20] Glenn made up his mind that he would
[1:16:25] survive he was determined and somehow to
[1:16:31] the amazement of the physicians he did
[1:16:33] survive yet when the mortal danger was
[1:16:36] passed he again heard a doctor and his
[1:16:38] mother speaking quietly the mother was
[1:16:40] told that since the fire had destroyed
[1:16:41] so much flesh in the lower part of his
[1:16:44] body that it would almost be better that
[1:16:46] he died since he was doomed to have a
[1:16:49] lifetime crippled in a wheelchair but he
[1:16:54] made up his mind he wouldn't be crippled
[1:16:57] he would walk and I don't go going all
[1:17:01] the details the story is wonderful that
[1:17:04] the flesh was completely melted in a way
[1:17:08] it was impossible to use his limbs but
[1:17:15] he was determined ultimately he was
[1:17:18] released from the hospital and this mum
[1:17:21] and dad had to massage his legs there
[1:17:23] was no feeling no control nothing yet
[1:17:26] his determination that he would walk was
[1:17:29] as strong as ever
[1:17:31] hallelujah he wasn't in bad one and he
[1:17:38] if he wasn't in bad he was confined to
[1:17:39] the wheelchair and one sunny day his
[1:17:41] mother wheel him out of the yard
[1:17:43] out into the yard to get some fresh air
[1:17:45] this day now I'm saying this day instead
[1:17:53] of sitting there he threw himself from
[1:17:56] the chair
[1:17:57] Glenn pull himself across the grass
[1:18:01] dragging his legs behind him he worked
[1:18:07] his way to the white picket fence
[1:18:09] bordering their lot with great effort he
[1:18:11] raised himself up the fence then stake
[1:18:15] by stake he began dragging himself along
[1:18:18] the fence resolved that he would walk he
[1:18:22] started to do that every single day
[1:18:28] ultimately through his daily massages
[1:18:31] Glenn's ayran persistence and his
[1:18:33] resolute determination he did develop
[1:18:36] the ability first to stand up then to
[1:18:40] walk haltingly with help than to walk by
[1:18:45] himself and then miraculously to run
[1:18:52] don't give up
[1:18:54] don't give up I have determined this day
[1:19:06] Glenn began to run through school he ran
[1:19:10] for the sheer joy of running and being
[1:19:12] able to run he ran everywhere that he
[1:19:15] could the people in his town would often
[1:19:17] see him run by by his own way having a
[1:19:21] huge smile on his face Oh believe me
[1:19:25] when you take of this water you will
[1:19:29] never thirst again you have a big
[1:19:32] smiling face and God wants to give so
[1:19:35] much more to each and every one now this
[1:19:38] little boy he had a positive attitude as
[1:19:44] strong as it as well as a strong
[1:19:46] religion his favorite bible verse was
[1:19:48] Isaiah 40:31 that those who wait upon
[1:19:51] the Lord shall renew their strength they
[1:19:53] shall mount a will we with wings like
[1:19:55] eagles they shall run and not be weary
[1:19:57] they shall walk and not faint

[1:21:10] nobody

[1:21:14] lies that boy was determined and he went
[1:21:18] to the Olympics he got records because
[1:21:24] he was determined that he was going to
[1:21:26] walk and I pray this morning that you
[1:21:30] are determined to come and drink of the
[1:21:34] water that he gives freely that's what
[1:21:42] it's all about
[1:21:46] God strategy is to take empty vessels
[1:21:51] and shake the world with them empty
[1:21:59] vessels no orange ping-pong balls
[1:22:02] emptied ourselves but filled with the
[1:22:06] Holy Ghost why don't we stand musicians
[1:22:15] that's what we need today is empty
[1:22:17] vessels so God can fill enough God
[1:22:25] cannot use you as long as you're filled
[1:22:28] up with yourself or with anything that
[1:22:32] is contrary to his word brother Branham
[1:22:36] gives us a quote and says the only thing
[1:22:37] a tree has to do that is planted by that
[1:22:40] water is to drink drink and spread out
