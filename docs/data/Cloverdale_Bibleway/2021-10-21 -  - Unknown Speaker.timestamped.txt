[0:00] and i was thinking about the process of
[0:02] life
[0:03] and actually the growth
[0:05] of human life
[0:07] and what is happening
[0:09] and you have no clue what's going on
[0:13] right
[0:14] like what's going on
[0:17] and so i have a little video just hold
[0:19] just hold it there for a second
[0:21] and i'll take this three minutes
[0:23] because i want you to realize
[0:25] as we just go through this little
[0:27] message tonight a little simple
[0:28] wednesday night
[0:29] that regardless of what you may see or
[0:32] hear or what your five senses here feel
[0:36] something very well could be transpiring
[0:39] you just have no you don't have a sense
[0:40] to see it except your faith
[0:44] accept your faith the sixth sense do not
[0:48] rely on your emotions and your
[0:50] affections and your memories and your
[0:51] your touch and your feeling your hearing
[0:53] all of that because you you're gonna
[0:54] miss the fact and the strength that you
[0:57] actually need knowing by faith it's
[0:59] actually happening but i don't see it
[1:01] happening
[1:02] so we're going to look at an example
[1:03] that this happens so why don't you throw
[1:06] up the video
[1:07] yeah
[1:09] all right so we have a human cell and
[1:12] it's been fertilized and it has just
[1:14] split
[1:15] this is just as fertilization and now
[1:17] the cell is splitting you have no clue
[1:19] this is happening
[1:20] this is like
[1:22] within hours 24 hours actually it begins
[1:24] to divide so this has happened within 24
[1:26] hours of fertilization and every 12 to
[1:28] 15 hours
[1:32] it continues to divide
[1:36] in about five days there's about 100
[1:38] cells
[1:40] you're saying what's happening i don't
[1:42] see life coming
[1:43] know what's happening
[1:45] at such a microscopic level you don't
[1:46] know here's about 100 cells and it
[1:48] breaks forth
[1:50] from this coding and this protection it
[1:52] has and these cells now break forth and
[1:53] they implant themselves under the womb
[1:55] and they actually don't just plant
[1:57] themselves there it actually then goes
[1:58] right into the lining
[2:01] of the membrane and now starts to grow
[2:03] continue to grow
[2:05] and the cells now which called is called
[2:07] gastrulation this is what's happening
[2:08] here and it's going to actually now
[2:09] start splitting and there's different
[2:10] layers of the cells that now start to
[2:12] grow
[2:13] and one layer starts to become you'll
[2:15] see in the little little uh
[2:17] video
[2:18] one becomes certain aspects of the body
[2:20] a third the middle layer becomes a
[2:22] certain aspect of the body and a bottom
[2:23] layer becomes a certain aspect of the
[2:26] body
[2:29] showing here lungs this is all happening
[2:32] and you have no clue
[2:34] you have no clue that life is in in
[2:37] formation
[2:39] as we as as you're living and you're
[2:41] like where's the problem where is it but
[2:43] it's happening here now you have a teeny
[2:45] teeny little
[2:46] not even an embryo yet this is his brain
[2:48] cells you can see the brain is still
[2:50] open and all the different cells are
[2:52] being formed and they're reaching out to
[2:54] each other
[2:55] and it's kind of now your organogenesis
[2:57] you're seeing the cells form of blood
[2:58] vessels as vessels and cells start going
[3:00] to their their areas of what their what
[3:03] they're
[3:03] meant to become here's your heart the
[3:05] little little one's heart now beating
[3:07] very early in development he's about at
[3:10] about uh four and a half weeks in or so
[3:12] he's about five a fifth of an inch long
[3:15] in 30 days he's about the size of a red
[3:16] currant
[3:18] and here his little arms now are
[3:19] starting to break forth and butt out
[3:21] from the from the main body
[3:25] organs start to go in place and we have
[3:26] this teeny
[3:28] teeny little
[3:29] aspect of a child that's being formed
[3:31] that's
[3:32] barely even at the at the end of about
[3:33] 60 days they're not even an inch long
[3:36] and a third of an ounce in weight
[3:38] cells start to recede and where it was
[3:40] webbed one time they started to recede
[3:42] and now they're not webbed the cells
[3:44] diminish in certain areas and each cell
[3:46] has a function to play and this teeny
[3:48] little one you say he's like very small
[3:51] it's like this big you have no clue
[3:54] no clue that this is happening
[3:58] [Music]
[4:00] incredible
[4:02] i marvel
[4:04] at life
[4:05] i marvel at it
[4:07] and you see something like this how on
[4:10] earth
[4:10] can someone say there's no god
[4:13] how on earth
[4:14] can someone look at that and see the
[4:16] form who tells those cells to go and be
[4:19] an arm who tells that cell to be a blood
[4:21] vessel and go to the brain and form the
[4:23] brain cells who gives it that
[4:25] intelligence you're telling me evolution
[4:27] it's garbage
[4:30] it's god himself that does that
[4:33] who who is what is the life that gives
[4:36] those cells that unction
[4:38] god
[4:40] god
[4:41] amen
[4:42] and a miracle of life it takes his time
[4:44] and all the while someone says i don't
[4:47] my mama doesn't really feel anything and
[4:49] in the first 30 days she has no clue
[4:50] what's really going on but it's
[4:52] happening
[4:53] there's an appointed time of life it's
[4:55] happening even though you might not see
[4:57] it or feel it but god has it ordained
[4:59] and his purpose will come to pass
[5:03] i want you to take that into your own
[5:04] situation say i don't know if you have a
[5:07] need and i'm not seeing it come to pass
[5:09] but maybe it's just like that little one
[5:11] maybe cell upon cell maybe little arm
[5:13] cells baby little liver cells that
[5:15] little heart starts to pump life is
[5:17] starting to pump just a few weeks deep
[5:19] and some life now is forming
[5:22] and your answer is on the way
[5:25] hallelujah
[5:26] amen
