[0:24] sometimes uh
[0:27] people that know what's going on kind of
[0:28] take it for granted. But when you see it

[12:45] to all those who prayed. Um,
[12:48] and I'm going to ask our brother John

[13:09] for a quick recovery as he's in the
[13:11] hospital with several several injuries.
[13:14] Sister Kalista wants us to pray for her
[13:17] brother Francis. He needs the Lord to
[13:19] come through for him in a situation. Um
[13:23] there's a request for brother Tim
[13:24] Perkins, Uncle Tom. He's going in for
[13:26] open heart surgery. Pray that all is
[13:29] well and it'll draw him closer to the

[14:00] brother is 39 years old. Does not know
[14:03] the Lord yet. Requesting Lord will use
[14:05] this situation to wake him spiritually
[14:06] and save him also for healing his body.
[14:09] Amen. How many have a need this morning?
[14:11] They want to be remembered before the
[14:12] Lord as we go to prayer. If you're
[14:13] listening in on the internet, on the
[14:15] phone, hookup, you've got a need this
[14:17] morning, just ask the Lord right now to
[14:19] meet that need. Amen. John,
[14:23] it's wonderful to be a Christian this
[14:24] morning. Amen. Be on the Lord's side.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; Father, we lift up our hands in your
[14:29] presence. so grateful that we can say
[14:32] that we're your children and you're our
[14:34] father and everything that we have need
[14:37] of is in your presence and in your word
[14:40] and by faith we're reaching through the
[14:42] veil of flesh and doubt and unbelief and
[14:45] negativism and this worldly system. So
[14:49] good to come to your house and be a free
[14:51] people. Be able to lift up our voices
[14:54] and our hands and worship you. You are
[14:56] worthy of our praises. You are worthy of
[14:59] our adoration. Oh, Father, you have
[15:02] healed us. You have saved us. You have
[15:04] filled us. You have brought homes back
[15:07] together. You've done miracles among us.
[15:10] And we just love your presence. And we
[15:12] love to be able to revel in your in the
[15:14] freshness of your nearness. Oh God. We
[15:17] invite you this morning right now in
[15:20] this service in a special way, in a
[15:23] divine way. May you come breaking
[15:25] through and cause there to be things
[15:27] happen that are supernatural alone. That
[15:30] we as your people would stand back and
[15:33] praise you. That lives would be healed
[15:36] even yet while they hear the word. That
[15:38] sicknesses and cancers and illnesses
[15:42] would be afraid at the atonements in
[15:44] effect. Lord, that lives would be
[15:46] delivered of backsliden cells and
[15:49] everything that is not of you and of
[15:51] perfect health that your children would
[15:54] be delivered in the house of God. We do
[15:57] not accept childhood illnesses. We do
[15:59] not accept middle-aged uh infirmities.
[16:02] We do not accept the excuse that it is
[16:05] just age. We have been promised a well
[16:08] body and we receive that this morning.
[16:11] The blood is still sufficient. Those
[16:13] stripes are still in effect, oh God. And
[16:16] so, Lord, would you heal your people?
[16:19] Send out a great wind of your presence.
[16:22] And may lives sense that coolness of
[16:25] your spirit and the angel visiting this
[16:27] address today. Father, we claim
[16:30] deliverance for lives that are bound.
[16:32] Even as a body of believers, we unite
[16:34] our hearts together that nothing would
[16:37] stand before the believer's prayers.
[16:39] That nothing would stand before their
[16:41] hearts. Lord, we love you, Father. We
[16:44] confess that you are more than
[16:46] sufficient to meet our heart's cry. May
[16:49] you burst through spirit realms,
[16:51] shackles fall off, walls come crushing
[16:55] down. That the Holy Spirit would be
[16:57] released into hearts that are dark and
[17:00] dingy and and discouraged. May hope come
[17:04] breaking through an array of hope today.
[17:07] bring life out of the situation and a
[17:10] fresh birth of your spirit, Father. Even
[17:13] those on the internet and those that are
[17:15] connected and our hearts, Lord, are
[17:17] burdened with these requests, Father.
[17:19] Lord, you know each one of them. Even
[17:22] before the semi swipe swiped the
[17:24] vehicle. Even before the vein bursted,
[17:27] Lord, and the blood went into the brain.
[17:30] Even our sister Anna that I believe is
[17:32] coming home this morning. We commit her
[17:34] to you, Lord. And other needs and their
[17:36] prayer requests, we lay our hands on
[17:38] them. Hands are lifted up all over the
[17:40] building because we believe you. We
[17:43] believe you and our faith is united with
[17:46] your word.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; Bless the minister this morning. Lord,
[17:52] if he steps out of the way and we as the
[17:54] congregation step out of the way, what
[17:57] could happen today?
[17:59] &gt;&gt; We sense that something is going to
[18:01] happen.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, we just invite you to
[18:05] have total and complete control of the
[18:07] service. May everything that is fleshly
[18:10] and carnal be submitted to the Holy
[18:13] Spirit that the word would have access
[18:15] in every area. We praise you already for
[18:19] the testimonies. We thank you for what
[18:21] you're going to do. We thank you for
[18:23] what you're doing. Hallelujah. We praise
[18:26] your holy name. Hallelujah. Praise be to
[18:30] the Lord Jesus Christ. Fill every vessel
[18:34] with the Holy Spirit. May there be no
[18:36] room for Satan to hide. May there be no
[18:39] room for his access, but may the Holy
[18:42] Spirit have such a freedom today. May
[18:45] there be a spontaneous eruption of the
[18:47] Holy Spirit that lives that are bound
[18:50] would be set free in your house. This is
[18:52] your house. Do whatever's in your heart
[18:55] to do today. And we love your appearing.
[18:59] We love your grace. We love your mercy.
[19:02] We love your power, Lord. So thankful
[19:05] for the blood. So thankful for the power
[19:08] of God. So thankful we are not a dead
[19:10] religion. So thankful we are not a
[19:13] denomination. So thankful we are not
[19:15] earthbound but we are eagles Lord and we
[19:18] want to soar today where all things are
[19:21] possible.
[19:23] Bless your people. Feed the flock.
[19:26] Minister Lord in places that only you
[19:29] can minister in Jesus name.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[19:42] Amen.
[19:43] [Music]
[19:57] We've got a baby dedication this
[19:59] morning. Uh and if we get uh brother
[20:02] Nathan, Sister Heidi to bring the little
[20:04] one up. Well, this is a special event
[20:06] this morning. We always uh deem it a
[20:09] great honor and privilege to dedicate
[20:11] our children back to the Lord. Um this
[20:14] morning, Eliza Christina Davies is going
[20:17] to be dedicated to the Lord. And um I
[20:22] didn't know whether we we want to say
[20:23] that this is the the cream of the pie
[20:27] or the sugar and spice that's going to
[20:29] make everything nice in the home, but I
[20:31] know what it is to have boys.
[20:34] And uh and a little girl is something
[20:36] special. And uh the Lord has granted to
[20:40] Nathan and Sister Heidi a little girl
[20:43] this morning.
[20:45] They have given me a little bit of um a
[20:47] testimony here. I'm going to read, but
[20:49] I'm going to read it with the scripture
[20:52] Nathan you sent me in the email. It's
[20:54] very appropriate and I believe a
[20:56] milestone
[20:59] for Eliza to live by. Out of Job 33,
[21:03] Brother Nathan gave me this scripture.
[21:05] The spirit of God hath made me and the
[21:09] breath of the Almighty has given me
[21:12] life.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; It's tremendous, tremendous scripture.
[21:17] And this was the testimony they would
[21:19] like to declare before the Church of the
[21:21] Living God. Today, we publicly want to
[21:24] thank our Lord Jesus for the miracle of
[21:27] our healthy baby Eliza. Prior to Eliza's
[21:31] birth, the doctors warned us that
[21:33] because of the lack of amniotic fluid
[21:35] during the critical time of her lung
[21:37] development, Eliza may have insufficient
[21:40] blood vessels in her lungs to support
[21:43] life. At birth, Eliza had to have
[21:46] maximum life support, and the doctors
[21:49] told us not to get our hopes up until
[21:52] she made it through the following four
[21:55] or five days. Our confession was that
[21:58] God had already given her the blood
[22:01] vessels she needed because we believed
[22:04] his word and saw God had had his hand on
[22:09] her before her birth.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; I said, "That's tremendous." And that's
[22:14] why you can take a scripture. I believe
[22:16] we are the word bride that we can take
[22:19] our experience, go back to the word and
[22:22] make a declaration. It is the Lord God
[22:26] that hath made me and given me breath.
[22:31] &gt;&gt; This is God's grace.
[22:34] To the doctor's amazement,
[22:36] Eliza came off the respirator after only
[22:39] five days. And many other miracles have
[22:42] happened along the way in the answer to
[22:44] the saints prayer. And today Eliza is
[22:48] completely healthy.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:58] And here's the public uh confession.
[23:01] Brother Nath Heidi would like to say
[23:03] we'd like to thank the congregation, the
[23:06] believers in the prayer meeting and
[23:07] others around the world who prayed.
[23:10] Eliza is a testimony that Jesus Christ
[23:14] is the same yesterday, today, and
[23:17] forever. I say to God be praised that he
[23:21] can have a mother and father of this
[23:23] character.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; A young man that has known his God and a
[23:28] young woman that has known her God from
[23:31] her youth.
[23:33] Eliza means an oath of God or to take an
[23:36] oath. It's a binding of the worshipper
[23:40] to the God they worship.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; The Bible declares of it comes from the
[23:45] root Elizabeth which says that Elizabeth
[23:48] was righteous before God walking in all
[23:51] the commandments and ordinance of the
[23:53] Lord and was blameless. I say may God so
[23:59] anoint this little Eliza that she had
[24:01] walked before God in all ordinances and
[24:04] through the blood of Jesus Christ come
[24:06] to the reality I'm blameless faultless
[24:10] and guiltless before my God who gave me
[24:13] breath may his hand ever be upon her
[24:16] life. Sister Heidi, God's blessed your
[24:18] home. You have sought God in your youth,
[24:21] Nathan in your youth, and God has grant
[24:23] to you the very desires of your heart,
[24:27] and we want to give God the praise.
[24:35] All right, let's pray.
[24:41] Father, cradled in my arms is a gift
[24:44] from God.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; You've blessed the home. You've blessed
[24:47] Sister Heidi, Brother Nathan, Lord,
[24:51] abundantly. You've given them boys. And
[24:53] now this little girl, may it be a joy in
[24:56] the home. And may she realize early in
[24:59] her life of who her creator is, this
[25:02] lovely Lord Jesus, the spirit of God
[25:05] that has given her breath to breathe.
[25:07] May your hand ever be upon her life. May
[25:10] you keep her in the center of your will.
[25:12] And may, Father God, the windows of
[25:14] heaven be ever opened upon her life. I'm
[25:18] sure this morning, Lord, the
[25:19] grandparents on both sides can lift up
[25:22] their eyes and say, "To God be the
[25:24] glory. Great things he has done." Lord,
[25:27] what a heritage this little Eliza has
[25:30] this morning. Grandparents on both sides
[25:33] serving God. Mommy and a daddy serving
[25:36] God. And may Lord God she raise up early
[25:39] if you should Terry to serve this living
[25:42] God our lovely Lord Jesus Christ. We
[25:45] dedicate her back to you this morning
[25:47] and giving you all the glory, the honor
[25:49] and praise in Jesus name. Amen.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; He's a miracle working God and he's
[25:57] still Hebrews 138.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:14] And we've got uh Darl, Sister Nicole
[26:17] visiting with us. Um Sister Nicole's
[26:20] sister Jennifer and uh
[26:23] somebody else is singing with him. I
[26:24] don't know who, but anyways, they know
[26:25] who it is. If you could come up at this
[26:27] time. Also, we one other announcement I
[26:29] forgot to make. We got the grad for all
[26:30] the uh
[26:34] young people at church that are
[26:36] graduating from high school this year.
[26:37] And that's happening on uh the 12th of
[26:40] January. So, a week Monday now, or June
[26:44] the 12th. I knew it started with J.
[26:46] Anyways, um
[26:49] uh they made the serious error of of
[26:51] putting Randy Snow and myself in charge.
[26:56] And uh some of the grads have not yet
[26:59] got us the pictures.
[27:02] Now you have to have them to us today.
[27:05] If you don't have them to today, then
[27:06] brother Randy and I are going to take
[27:08] our liberty to make some stuff up. So
[27:10] you believe me, you don't want to have
[27:12] that to happen. Grads who haven't I
[27:14] think there's about 10 of them that
[27:15] don't have pictures to us yet. And also
[27:18] now another thing I want from each one
[27:19] of the grads somehow someway get to me
[27:22] this week or to brother Randy. We need a
[27:25] little overview, something that we can
[27:26] say while the pictures of yourselves are
[27:29] being shown in front of everyone. And
[27:31] again, if you don't get us something to
[27:33] say while the pictures, you can write a
[27:35] poem, you can do a little, you know,
[27:37] whatever you want. You know, the
[27:38] pictures that were sent, so you can you
[27:40] can provide us with a description of
[27:42] those pictures or a a uh just send us
[27:45] something to read while those pictures
[27:47] being shown. And again, if you don't
[27:49] send us something, then we'll take our
[27:51] liberty to make something up. So,
[27:58] [Music]
[28:13] Who am I that the Lord of all the earth
[28:18] would care to know my name
[28:22] would care to know my hurt?
[28:27] And who am I that the bright and morning
[28:31] star
[28:32] would choose to light the way for my
[28:37] ever wondering heart.
[28:41] Not because of who I am, but because of
[28:46] what you've done. Not because of what
[28:49] I've done, but because of who you are.
[28:56] I am a flower quickly fading
[29:00] here today and on tomorrow.
[29:04] A wave tossed in the ocean.
[29:07] A vapor in the wind. Still you hear me
[29:12] when I'm calling. Lord, you catch me
[29:15] when I'm falling. And you told me I am.
[29:23] I am yours.
[29:26] [Music]
[29:30] I am yours.
[29:36] Who am I that the eyes that see my sin
[29:42] would look on me in love
[29:45] and watch me rise again?
[29:50] Who am I that the voice that calmed the
[29:54] sea
[29:55] would call out through the rain
[29:59] and calm the storm in me.
[30:04] Not because of who I am, but because of
[30:08] what you've done. Not because of what
[30:12] I've done, but because of who you are.
[30:18] I am a flower quickly fading.
[30:23] Here today and gone tomorrow.
[30:27] A wave tossed in the ocean.
[30:30] A vapor in the wind. Still you hear me
[30:34] when I'm calling. Lord, you catch me
[30:38] when I'm falling. And you told me who I
[30:42] am.
[30:45] Not because of who I am, but because of
[30:49] what you've done. Not because of what I
[30:53] done, but because of who you are.
[30:59] I am a flower quickly fading. Here today
[31:04] and gone tomorrow.
[31:07] A wave tossed in the ocean. A vapor in
[31:11] the wind. Still, you hear me when I'm
[31:15] calling, Lord. You catch me when I'm
[31:19] falling. And you told me who I am.
[31:25] I am yours.
[31:32] I am yours.
[31:35] [Music]
[31:39] I am
[31:42] yours.
[31:47] [Music]
[31:49] [Applause]
[31:59] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you're in his care?
[32:01] Amen.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; He knows what is going to happen
[32:04] tomorrow. He holds the future in his
[32:06] hands. I'm so thankful that we serve a
[32:08] living God.

[32:11] its power. As brother brother's going to

[36:57] [Applause]
[37:03] [Applause]
[37:13] Glory. Holy Jesus
[37:20] for his.
[37:30] How we thank you, Father,
[37:33] for the sacrifice of Calvary
[37:36] that you made this available to every
[37:39] one of your children. And we stand here
[37:42] today, Lord, saying, "I am redeemed
[37:45] by the blood of Jesus Christ. We're a
[37:49] happy people, Father. We're a happy
[37:52] family.
[37:54] Your grace has been so abundant to us.
[37:57] And on behalf of all the people that are
[37:59] gathered in the visible audience and
[38:02] those in the invisible audience out on
[38:04] the internet on the telephone hook up
[38:07] and those that will hear the archive
[38:09] service, we pray that the same anointing
[38:13] that is present with us now will flood
[38:16] the rooms and the buildings where the
[38:19] people are assembled. And may it be a
[38:22] mighty mighty move of God upon their
[38:24] soul. May the church, the bride of Jesus
[38:28] Christ, may that bride body be built up,
[38:30] Lord, to its final place and the final
[38:34] one to come in, oh God. And may this
[38:37] final message that is being sent out by
[38:40] the bride of Jesus Christ, I pray it
[38:43] will accomplish all you have intended it
[38:46] to do in Jesus' name. Amen.
[38:51] [Music]
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; It's a good day.
[38:59] We had a glorious time at the open house
[39:04] &gt;&gt; for all that were able to be here. And
[39:07] uh
[39:09] maybe I'll just allow you to have your
[39:10] seats for a few moments if you don't
[39:12] mind. Uh,
[39:16] I think there was about
[39:19] perhaps as many as 400 people that
[39:22] actually came through and went on the
[39:24] tours through the church. I came and my
[39:27] wife and we went on one.
[39:30] Uh, it was an eyeopener.
[39:34] How many people that came through and uh
[39:39] didn't realize what goes on behind the
[39:41] scenes? Let me see your hands and hold
[39:43] them up.
[39:45] I got to put up both of my hands. I I've
[39:48] been involved in almost well, I guess
[39:50] every every area in almost every detail,
[39:53] but there's a lot of things that I just
[39:56] didn't know.
[39:58] Uh,
[40:00] and don't know exactly how it all takes
[40:03] place, but it was it was just really
[40:05] remarkable.
[40:07] I want to uh I have the concept the idea
[40:11] we should have an open house but that's
[40:13] that's a simple statement you know and
[40:16] talk is cheap
[40:18] sometimes a lot of work has to go on
[40:20] behind that then brother Tom took a hold
[40:23] of it and uh we begin to develop some
[40:28] thoughts and ideas and brother John
[40:30] Andy's
[40:32] came to uh our assistance and without
[40:36] the efforts of brother Tom and brother
[40:38] John. It just would not have been the
[40:40] evening that it was. And I want to thank
[40:43] them each one for their effort and the
[40:47] work that was done. And then all the
[40:50] various departments of ministry because
[40:52] it was their idea. Let's get all the
[40:54] various departments of ministry and have
[40:56] them say something and let's put a video
[41:00] together. And so the video brethren got
[41:03] together. So there was all the
[41:05] departments of ministry which were the
[41:08] duplicating and the groups went through
[41:10] each of those areas. Brother John,
[41:12] brother Tom took a hold of it and timed
[41:16] uh how many might be in a group and how
[41:18] long it might take and then had each one
[41:21] of the different departments write a
[41:24] paragraph of what they would need to say
[41:27] in order to describe what it is they do
[41:30] in order to send this message. to have
[41:33] it duplicated or to give the sound in
[41:35] the sanctuary. So, and then each of them
[41:40] would be standing and saying uh what it
[41:43] is they do and describing it to every
[41:45] group and I think there was about 19
[41:48] groups. So if those various areas and
[41:51] the groups started at 15 persons but 15
[41:55] we saw that it wasn't going to or those
[41:58] in charge saw it wasn't going to uh we
[42:02] weren't going to get through all the
[42:03] people so it was increased to about 20
[42:06] and 25 and someone told me that one of
[42:08] the groups had about 27. Well, that
[42:10] really is almost an overload. But by by
[42:15] the time the evening was over, if those
[42:18] that were speaking in all the different
[42:20] departments, if they didn't have their
[42:23] uh paragraph rehearsed, I tell you, they
[42:25] knew it well by the end of the day.
[42:28] Uh there was a duplicating
[42:31] uh area, the sanctuary sound here, the
[42:36] internet sound and the brothers were
[42:39] there. Then the internet streaming and
[42:42] the brothers that sit there, the video
[42:45] edit suite up here and uh and the two
[42:49] parts of the video editing and the
[42:52] streaming from the sanctuary that is
[42:56] done from handled from there and then
[42:59] the translation live translation which
[43:02] is taking place at this moment up here
[43:04] and the Chinese Vietnamese
[43:08] the French and other languages. Uh, and
[43:12] things are being put into place right
[43:14] now that we'll be able to handle a
[43:17] number of languages
[43:19] simultaneously,
[43:21] which we are able to do now, but we'll
[43:23] be able to put on the internet live
[43:26] while the service is in progress. And uh
[43:31] uh it it it just moved me because as
[43:36] brother Murphy began to actually preach
[43:39] the service that was coming up and for
[43:41] those you went through I don't know what
[43:42] you experienced but I can't hear that. I
[43:46] I sense the anointing of God come on the
[43:49] on brother Murphy while he was doing it
[43:52] and it starts to break me up because I
[43:54] can just imagine what that must sound
[43:58] like to someone who does not understand
[44:02] the language English language that the
[44:04] prophet brought the message in but are
[44:06] able to hear it live like that with a
[44:10] dedicated anointed voice I tell you
[44:13] friends it's a I feel highly very
[44:15] privileged to even have any part of it
[44:19] and then from the
[44:21] uh from the translation then went into
[44:24] the missions department where brother
[44:26] Tony was and spoke to the people of all
[44:29] the various areas and works and even in
[44:32] our group I was surprised when he said
[44:35] how many don't have the last believers
[44:36] faith challenge report that's put out
[44:39] some time ago and several of our own
[44:42] people hadn't hadn't picked one up
[44:44] didn't have one yet. And I think if
[44:47] you're here and have not seen that
[44:49] there's a lot of work, not just gone
[44:52] into the faith challenge report, but
[44:55] when you think of the people that are
[44:58] scattered all over the world in the
[45:00] areas where God has opened doors for our
[45:03] congregation to be able to work in, uh
[45:06] then you know that a lot has gone into
[45:09] it before it can even be put on paper
[45:13] before you can receive it in your hand
[45:14] and read it. So when you read it, you
[45:16] must know that there's months and months
[45:18] and months of the working of the Holy
[45:20] Spirit all over the globe that has taken
[45:24] place before it can even be put in
[45:26] words. And so then you want to have an
[45:28] appreciation for that. And thank God
[45:30] that you're privileged to be able to
[45:32] hold that in your hand and read of the
[45:35] working not of man. If it's of man, it
[45:37] will pass away and become nothing, but
[45:39] the working of the Holy Spirit.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:43] And then up through the uh Bible way
[45:46] Christian Academy and uh the school uh
[45:50] there were just so so many remarks. And
[45:53] then while all of that was taking place
[45:56] and the groups were going through from
[45:59] two different directions so we wouldn't
[46:00] end up too many in one spot at one time.
[46:03] And it was timed very very lovely. I I
[46:06] know there were people that had to wait
[46:07] a wee bit but it was um it it went very
[46:10] very smooth. And then uh the the young
[46:13] people were here singing so that the
[46:17] live streaming and the video editing
[46:19] could uh have something live that was
[46:21] happening. So the young people, many of
[46:24] them, maybe 50, 60 of them here singing
[46:26] and others singing uh specials all
[46:29] evening. And some of the people that
[46:31] were had uh you know, just had to step
[46:33] in and sit down and and so there were a
[46:36] lot of people at different parts of the
[46:38] building being able to hear that. Uh the
[46:41] video that the brothers made for the
[46:43] evening was being played constantly in
[46:46] the toddler's room there. So I want to
[46:49] thank all of those that participated and
[46:52] were in that uh uh gave so much of
[46:55] themselves to have the evening for the
[46:58] church and for all who wish to come. the
[47:01] young people and the guides out of the
[47:04] young people, the senior young people
[47:06] who acted as guides and took the people
[47:09] all through. Then I do not want to
[47:11] forget, you notice I'm not mentioning
[47:15] names here because I couldn't even begin
[47:17] to mention all the names, but all those
[47:20] in the congregation
[47:22] who worked to make uh they worked in the
[47:26] yard. They powerwashed and sprayed the
[47:30] fence and did all the landscaping and
[47:33] and where the curbs were broke and fixed
[47:36] the curbs and did all kinds of things
[47:39] throughout the church. Things that were
[47:41] uh I I couldn't even have dreamed said,
[47:43] "Well, the door jambs are scratched. We
[47:46] need to paint those." And the brothers
[47:47] were here and if anybody had a few
[47:50] moments on their hands, they weren't
[47:51] they weren't idle very long and they
[47:54] were doing something. I can say all the
[47:56] hands really uh uh did a just did a
[48:02] masterful job and and I want to thank
[48:05] you because I believe it shows something
[48:08] out of the pre out of the people's heart
[48:11] when they want to have the place where
[48:13] we worship to have it nice not to have
[48:16] it run down. I believe that's important.
[48:19] you you pride yourself in your homes and
[48:22] you like to have things neat and clean
[48:24] and I think that's good and I think it
[48:26] should be that way and when we come in
[48:29] the house of God see all the message
[48:31] books uh neatly put in place made
[48:35] accessible to us never we won't want to
[48:37] take it for granted do we and uh so it
[48:41] was a very special evening brother Tom
[48:43] do you have a comment about that all
[48:46] Right.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; I'm always moved when you see what God
[48:53] does. And after we had gone home after
[48:56] the evening, Joanna and I were standing
[48:58] in the kitchen
[49:01] and I thought I went back into my mind
[49:03] of a young couple that moved out from
[49:05] Toronto by the voice of God and said,
[49:08] "Go west." not knowing where they were
[49:11] going and knowing that there were there
[49:13] were people that needed that ministry,
[49:16] needed that voice, needed that type of
[49:19] word to shape and mold them. And I
[49:22] thought after walking through and and we
[49:24] did, we put a lot of hours in to do what
[49:26] we did and to see the people blessed and
[49:28] you coming up, different ones, brothers
[49:30] move said, "Hey, I didn't realize the
[49:33] brothers are doing all this." I said to
[49:35] one group of brothers, I said, 'Well, in
[49:37] a lot of churches, maybe one or two are
[49:39] are working behind the scenes, and we're
[49:41] sitting here this morning, and you know
[49:43] that there's 11 brothers working
[49:46] whatever they can do to get this word
[49:48] out. And I thought, that's amazing.
[49:50] That's 33 times through a week, and we
[49:53] sit here and rejoice. And I thought, you
[49:55] know, Brother Ed and Sister Ruth going
[49:57] home, I I I trust in some little way God
[50:01] could just give them a little window to
[50:04] see how much we appreciate lives that
[50:06] have been poured out, not just for us,
[50:09] but for around the world. And to see
[50:11] that there's God's got his mighty band
[50:14] behind. One man can't do it, but we're
[50:17] all there and have a Tony and a
[50:19] different ones and we're all doing our
[50:21] portion. I thought, Lord, would you just
[50:24] give Brother Biscll and Sister Ruth a
[50:26] little taste of a little bit of
[50:27] satisfaction to know their lives have
[50:30] been used for the glory of God? And I
[50:32] believe we've been blessed. Bride of
[50:34] Christ have been blessed. And I say,
[50:35] Brother Biscol and Sister Ruth, bless
[50:38] you. And we're just fruits of your
[50:40] labor. Amen.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:56] And I'd like to give a hand to all of
[50:57] those that worked so hard to make it all
[51:00] possible.
[51:10] And
[51:13] uh
[51:15] I didn't expect Brother Tom to be saying
[51:17] those things or I wouldn't have had him
[51:18] up here.
[51:22] I think I can take just a few moments.
[51:25] Uh there's always something special that
[51:28] happens just you know something a little
[51:30] unique and brother Lyall Black uh dear
[51:35] friends from long ago and sister Sherry
[51:39] his wife with him and we were going
[51:42] through and I we just happened to I said
[51:44] to my wife we got to go through and one
[51:47] of these tours and so we'll associate
[51:50] ourselves with one of these groups and
[51:51] so we were in their group and we were up
[51:54] here. And and uh so brother Michelle
[51:58] says, "Okay, now over to you." Uh I
[52:02] think it was brother Philip Ashdown and
[52:04] Michael Ray. They're sitting here
[52:06] looking down at these windows and says,
[52:08] "All right. Uh now what we're doing
[52:10] here," they said, "Now we're taking the
[52:12] live shot of the picture." And here we
[52:14] have one right here. And now I need to
[52:17] merge some sound with this picture. And
[52:19] so here we here we are at 5 43 2 1
[52:24] Phillip. All right. Now give me the
[52:27] sound now. The sound is merging with
[52:28] this. And it was going like this. And
[52:30] when they when they finish this their
[52:32] spiel
[52:34] they said is there any questions?
[52:36] Brother Lyall Black says, "Yeah, how old
[52:39] are you fellas?"
[52:44] I thought that was a very good question.
[52:47] One says I'm 20. I'm 24. It was about
[52:50] that time. I just ready to bury my head
[52:52] and walk out. You know, you just get
[52:54] feeling that way. But God has to raise
[52:57] up those that don't only have talents
[52:59] and skill, but have to be dedicated.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're thankful for that. I need to
[53:04] bring you greetings as of this morning
[53:07] from uh Brother Isaac Noriega. Had a
[53:10] conversation with brother Isaac Noriega
[53:13] in Tucson. And for those of you that
[53:16] don't know, brother Isaac Noriega has
[53:18] wonderful translators in his church and
[53:20] they are translating on a regular basis
[53:22] and they send their discs up here and
[53:25] that's the Spanish goes on the internet
[53:28] of the message. Brother Gido from
[53:31] Belgium sent a brief email yesterday. He
[53:35] just just returned from Siberia where
[53:38] he's been for quite some time. They had
[53:41] very great opposition. He said almost
[53:44] physical almost became physical but in
[53:47] spite of the opposition God gave them
[53:49] wonderful victory. Uh several were
[53:52] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[53:54] Christ or orphanages were visited and
[53:58] the believers were built up and
[54:00] encouraged in the meetings and that's
[54:02] what it's all about. And he's going to
[54:04] be sending a report that we'll be able
[54:05] to give you in a few days. um as my
[54:10] sister an sister Anne was discharged
[54:13] this morning and uh so I think her part
[54:16] of the family are picking her up this
[54:19] morning. So thank you for your prayers
[54:21] on that on their behalf and I enjoyed
[54:24] that song by uh the message sisters
[54:29] sister Nicole Towns and Sister Jennifer
[54:32] Gray and her daughter. I enjoyed that
[54:35] song. All right. Do you mind me taking
[54:39] that little time? Would you mind
[54:41] standing? We're going to read some
[54:42] scriptures. A brief scripture reading in
[54:45] Matthew 23.
[54:50] Scripture reading from last Sunday. I'm
[54:53] just going to read one scripture and it
[54:55] is verse 23 of Matthew. And before we
[54:59] read, let's just look to the author once
[55:02] again.
[55:03] Almighty God,
[55:06] your word, our Bibles are being opened.
[55:10] We're going to read them. But it takes
[55:12] much more than human understanding.
[55:15] It takes much more than what each of us
[55:18] have learned in our school years where
[55:21] we learn to read. Lord, it takes now the
[55:25] Holy Spirit to inspire the very minds
[55:29] and the hearts to take Lord my lips I
[55:33] pray this morning and express your
[55:36] thoughts oh God by the Holy Spirit of
[55:39] God in the name of Jesus Christ we now s
[55:43] dedicate and surrender ourselves holy to
[55:46] you in Jesus Christ's name amen
[55:52] Jesus Jesus speaking once again, "Woe
[55:54] unto you scribes and Pharisees,
[55:57] hypocrites, for ye pay tithe of mint and
[56:00] an annis and come and have omitted the
[56:04] weightier matters of the law, judgment,
[56:08] mercy, and faith. These ought ye to have
[56:11] done, and not to leave the other
[56:14] undone." I will be uh spending most of
[56:19] the service this morning on the judgment
[56:23] aspect. And uh this judgment is the
[56:26] discernment or the distinguishing
[56:29] between one thing and another making a
[56:32] valued judgment
[56:34] uh decision. And then I want to read out
[56:37] of second Corinthians the 4th chapter
[56:41] just two verses verses three and four.
[56:46] 2 Corinthians 4,
[56:53] Apostle Paul writing to the Corinthians,
[56:57] "But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to
[57:01] them that are lost,
[57:03] in whom the God of this world hath
[57:07] blinded the minds of them which believe
[57:10] not." So if you'll watch that closely,
[57:13] the God of this world, if he's a god,
[57:16] then he's being worshiped. The god of
[57:19] this world hath blinded and he hath been
[57:22] successful hath blinded the minds of
[57:26] them which believe not. So to doubt or
[57:29] to disbelieve causes a blindness. And it
[57:33] says, "Lest the light of the glorious
[57:35] gospel of Christ uh who is the image of
[57:38] the of God should shine unto them." May
[57:43] God take his word now and and bless it
[57:45] to our hearts. You may be seated.
[57:51] Keep your Bibles handy. We will be
[57:53] reading
[57:55] later on.
[57:57] Now, Apostle Paul said that the god of
[58:01] this world hath blinded the minds. And
[58:04] that word blinded here is is to blunt to
[58:10] blunt the ma mental discernment.
[58:15] So the god of this, in other words, to
[58:18] question. So the scribes and the
[58:20] Pharisees, for example, they were always
[58:22] questioning Christ. They were always
[58:24] reasoning and and trying to, you know,
[58:28] determine how they might uh uh not only
[58:32] question Christ, but question him at and
[58:35] at from such a direction and uh so that
[58:39] they might catch him or trap him. All of
[58:42] that was because they didn't really
[58:43] believe in him. They didn't believe he
[58:46] was who he was. And by by disbelieving
[58:50] that their very act of trying to bring
[58:52] that into human reasoning uh and the
[58:56] fact that they were questioning it
[58:57] actually blunted their mental perception
[59:02] so that then they were incapable of
[59:05] making a clear decision.
[59:08] That is a and that is the blinding part.
[59:11] And so this I want to uh focus on some
[59:16] areas of our lives.
[59:21] And each person here is is party to this
[59:25] because we live in the world but we are
[59:29] not of the world. That has to be a very
[59:34] clear distinction in us amongst us here.
[59:38] But because we live in the world, we are
[59:42] involved.
[59:44] We are interacting on a daily basis with
[59:48] the world and with those who are of the
[59:52] world because we are in the world. There
[59:56] are many areas of our lives which are
[1:00:00] essential. We are essentially involved
[1:00:04] with we are involved with our children
[1:00:07] being educated. We are involved with our
[1:00:10] work, our profession
[1:00:13] uh uh business that we may be in. We are
[1:00:16] involved with um worship. We're involved
[1:00:21] with uh a church as such. We're involved
[1:00:24] in many of those areas which are not
[1:00:27] unique to us because everyone in the
[1:00:30] world pretty well uh is involved somehow
[1:00:33] in that but part of it there's a very
[1:00:37] very slim percentage of it that is
[1:00:41] actually of God
[1:00:44] and the rest of it is part of this world
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; and that takes a divine
[1:00:53] discernment of God to know between one
[1:00:57] and the other.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; And I want to take it a little bit
[1:01:00] further to say that there are there are
[1:01:04] many of these areas in fact most of
[1:01:06] these areas of our lives that are
[1:01:09] essential to us and we find ourselves
[1:01:12] moving in them because uh and this will
[1:01:16] come very very clear to you in just a
[1:01:18] short while. But as our lives go on, we
[1:01:21] are moving in these areas of our lives.
[1:01:24] But it is, and I'd like to expose Satan
[1:01:27] today, so he's not going to like this
[1:01:29] message. But Satan is determined to try
[1:01:33] to have those areas of our lives kind of
[1:01:36] swallow us up until what that son and
[1:01:40] daughter of God who is in the world, he
[1:01:43] would like us to become so uh so
[1:01:47] swallowed up that we become uh almost
[1:01:51] captivated and controlled by that which
[1:01:53] is of the world.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Has that been clear? If it's not clear,
[1:01:59] it will become clear. Now,
[1:02:03] uh we happen to be we are
[1:02:07] uh we are in a bride age as believers.
[1:02:13] But although we are in a bride age, it's
[1:02:16] like Jesus said, we are in the world,
[1:02:18] but we are not of the world. We are in a
[1:02:22] bride age, but yet we are also in a
[1:02:25] Leodysian age. We are not of the
[1:02:28] Leodysian age. We happen to interact
[1:02:31] with it
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; every day. We're in that last age that
[1:02:37] uh that there's only seven of them and
[1:02:39] we're in that last age, but we are not
[1:02:42] of that age. We just happen to have to
[1:02:46] interact with it every day of our lives.
[1:02:49] Now
[1:02:51] uh Jesus said concerning the uh
[1:02:54] Leodysian age and it's a it's an age
[1:02:57] which is a homogenization
[1:03:00] to become lukewarm.
[1:03:03] It was described as being thou lukewarm
[1:03:06] and lukewarm is just a homogenizing of
[1:03:09] hot water and cold water and it just
[1:03:12] becomes and you can't find the dividing
[1:03:15] line.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. Where is
[1:03:18] the where is the divine discernment? Who
[1:03:21] is going to uh guide us? So we uh and he
[1:03:26] said I sooner have you hot or cold
[1:03:29] because lukewarm is just a you know it's
[1:03:32] just a homogenizing of the both and that
[1:03:35] is this generation. Oh, everybody
[1:03:37] believe, you know, believe whatever you
[1:03:38] want to. We have to accept people and
[1:03:41] there there's no uh and and and quite
[1:03:44] often there's a lot of resistance to you
[1:03:46] having a firm conviction about something
[1:03:48] because if you do, you're a bigot.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; And I don't agree with that. I say a
[1:03:55] person that a person that doesn't stand
[1:03:57] up for their convictions, uh they're
[1:04:00] they're they're not even a man or a
[1:04:02] woman. You got to be able to stand up
[1:04:04] for your convictions. But then you're
[1:04:06] not being honest with yourself.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; And so in lukewarm to be lukewarm is
[1:04:12] something that is halfhearted,
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; un unenthusiastic,
[1:04:18] apathetic, indifferent or laxidasical.
[1:04:23] Right.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; So Jesus was saying there is a there's a
[1:04:27] this age is kind of halfhearted and
[1:04:31] unenthusiastic
[1:04:33] and apathetic. A condition of the soul.
[1:04:37] Lukewarm is a condition of the soul that
[1:04:40] wretchedly fluctuates between dormcancy,
[1:04:45] being dormant,
[1:04:47] inactive
[1:04:48] or a numbness,
[1:04:51] and hot or cold. The hot part is fervor
[1:04:56] and zeal and dedication and eagerness
[1:04:59] and commitment and and love. A a real
[1:05:02] zeal. And so now just watch. People have
[1:05:06] started out and many of us can no doubt
[1:05:09] identify this. Start out and we're all
[1:05:11] invigorated and we're enthusiastic and
[1:05:14] we're zealous and so on. But as time
[1:05:16] goes on,
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; as time goes on,
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; it just gets wearing on that. What wears
[1:05:23] on it? What is it that wears on it? What
[1:05:25] is it that saps that out? The world.
[1:05:31] So, we're in the world, but we're not of
[1:05:34] the world. But it's that which is of the
[1:05:36] world that is draining and and
[1:05:40] exhausting and takes away from that
[1:05:43] fervor and that zeal and that
[1:05:45] enthusiasm.
[1:05:46] Oh my. And that activity and pretty soon
[1:05:49] it becomes more inactive
[1:05:52] and more apathetic.
[1:05:54] And not that we want to, but that's the
[1:05:57] effect of the world. And we got to say,
[1:06:00] when do we say this thing stops right
[1:06:02] here?
[1:06:04] This has gone far enough. And I've got a
[1:06:07] discernment of the Holy Spirit, and I'm
[1:06:10] not going to allow the world to have
[1:06:12] that effect upon me.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Glad you're catching it.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham, he's he he
[1:06:21] preaches a sermon and it's a looking at
[1:06:24] the unseen. And we heard brother Tom
[1:06:27] preaching a couple wonderful services,
[1:06:29] the last two. Not that those were just
[1:06:32] the only ones, but those were really
[1:06:34] appropriate at this time. And that we
[1:06:37] have to look to the unseen by looking at
[1:06:40] the unseen, but not seeing everything
[1:06:42] that not allowing everything we see to
[1:06:45] have its effect upon us. We look at the
[1:06:47] unseen and bring and by faith bring the
[1:06:51] invisible and have it materialize in
[1:06:54] front of us. We need to be looking at
[1:06:56] what the real issues of life and what is
[1:06:58] the purpose of life. Otherwise, we'll
[1:07:01] certainly miss the mark. And brother
[1:07:02] Brandham had preached this service
[1:07:04] sermon. Then he went into prayer. And
[1:07:07] this is what I think every preacher has
[1:07:09] feels this way sometime after sermon. He
[1:07:11] said, 'Lord, let this little broke up
[1:07:13] message tonight that I have fumbled
[1:07:16] around over here trying to find the lead
[1:07:21] to something that I would break that
[1:07:23] would break a revival and it seems like
[1:07:26] Lord, I just can't find the spot.
[1:07:31] We preached a whole service. It's all
[1:07:33] done. Feels I fumbled around. I've tried
[1:07:36] to find the leadership. I've tried to
[1:07:38] find the spot and I just couldn't find
[1:07:41] it. Seems like the people still can't
[1:07:43] get in it somehow. And the word goes
[1:07:46] forth and I'm sure that the spirit is
[1:07:48] here. Lord, what is the hour that we're
[1:07:50] living in? It's the hour of numbness.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; It's the hour of numbness. It is the
[1:07:58] hour that the church has been lulled
[1:08:00] asleep by the things of the world
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; and by all kinds of things that they
[1:08:08] should not have listened to.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Is that our here Lord? But it had such
[1:08:13] an effect on him while he said it kind
[1:08:16] of brought the people into a numbness
[1:08:19] and the numbness which is that is what
[1:08:23] that either hot or cold that dormcy and
[1:08:27] inactivity
[1:08:29] or numbness. Not that we want that, not
[1:08:32] that we desire that but that's the
[1:08:34] effect of what's what is of the world.
[1:08:39] And then he goes right after that
[1:08:41] immediately just simply starts in. He
[1:08:43] says right back over in this corner, I
[1:08:46] see a man. Do not know him. Never seen
[1:08:49] him in my life as far as I know. Mr.
[1:08:52] Cop, stand up. Jesus Christ makes you
[1:08:55] well.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Here's a lady sitting here right here at
[1:08:59] me praying and she's saying, "God, be
[1:09:03] merciful to me."
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; What dimension is he in?
[1:09:06] He says, "That's what she's saying. God,
[1:09:09] be merciful to me." You were praying. He
[1:09:11] said, "Oh Jesus, let him call me."
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; That's what she's saying. You were
[1:09:16] saying, "Oh, Jesus, let him call me.
[1:09:19] Mrs. Hoist,
[1:09:21] you may go home and be well if you
[1:09:23] believe
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; after a fumbled up message,
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; after perhaps feeling he hadn't hit the
[1:09:29] spot. I've been trying to find the
[1:09:30] place." But it happens because the world
[1:09:35] invades our minds and causes us to be
[1:09:38] numb.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; And that fervor, where's that fervor of
[1:09:42] years ago? Hallelujah. I thank God we
[1:09:45] got a young conver uh a congregation.
[1:09:48] But it's nothing saying that an old
[1:09:50] waror.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. An a laborer, a godly sister such
[1:09:55] as we have here in a congregation. The
[1:09:58] scripture tells me we can remain like
[1:10:00] Caleb. We can remain full of fervor and
[1:10:04] zeal and the faith of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:07] and believe the promise of God. Do not
[1:10:10] be weary and welloing.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; For you shall reap if we faint not. And
[1:10:15] we shall not faint.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; We're not We're not of the age to faint.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; We're of the age to go on in.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; That's our promise. We claim that
[1:10:25] promise.
[1:10:27] We are here as believers.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; We're We're not here as unbelievers.
[1:10:31] We're here as believers.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; We're not here to go through the motions
[1:10:38] of some brand of religion.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; That's not why we're here.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; We're deeply committed
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; to this gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Although we are committed, as I said a
[1:10:51] moment ago,
[1:10:53] we're not immune
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; to the spirit. that's in the world.
[1:10:57] We're not immune to the fact as the
[1:11:00] Apostle Paul referred to it. He said
[1:11:03] this present evil age. We're not immune
[1:11:06] to this present evil age in the sense of
[1:11:08] the word. We're not immune. We are
[1:11:10] immune to it, but we're not immune to
[1:11:12] the interaction that we must have
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; from it.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul taught the Corinthian
[1:11:18] church.
[1:11:20] He called it that the God of this evil
[1:11:23] age hath blinded the minds of them which
[1:11:25] believe not. The scripture which we just
[1:11:28] read and brother Brandham calls it this
[1:11:31] world
[1:11:33] as Satan's Eden.
[1:11:36] God's Eden he said was established in
[1:11:39] righteousness and Satan's Eden is
[1:11:42] established in sin because Satan is sin.
[1:11:45] Amen.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; God is righteousness and God's kingdom
[1:11:51] was established in righteousness and
[1:11:53] peace and life. And Satan's
[1:11:57] establishment
[1:11:58] is in sin and it's remarkable and
[1:12:02] religious sin.
[1:12:07] This world that we rub shoulders with,
[1:12:10] the world that we interact with daily,
[1:12:14] it is this world that Satan has designed
[1:12:17] upon the basis of science
[1:12:20] and beauty.
[1:12:23] The challenge for the believer
[1:12:27] is to discern
[1:12:30] the subtle approaches of Satan.
[1:12:34] and to resist those approaches
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; that he attempts to impose upon us
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; in our daily lives by his reasoning and
[1:12:45] he reasons with us that we need it.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; He reasoned with Eve that she needed
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; this experience that her eyes would be
[1:12:55] open and it'd be like God's knowing good
[1:12:58] and evil. No, notice he was promising
[1:13:02] her a discernment at the same time
[1:13:05] blinding her to discernment.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; And that is his tactic.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; He promises that we're going to be uh
[1:13:15] achieving something when in fact he's
[1:13:18] blinding the people from achieving their
[1:13:21] goal.
[1:13:26] Now,
[1:13:28] when Jesus rebuked the leaders, the
[1:13:31] scribes and the Pharisees in our Matthew
[1:13:34] scripture, and I'm just giving you some
[1:13:35] background here,
[1:13:39] he rebuked the leaders for having
[1:13:41] omitted the weightier matters. And that
[1:13:44] is the same thing. It's it is it is a
[1:13:47] neglect of them or a disregard. That's
[1:13:50] all it is. It's not saying I don't
[1:13:52] believe it anymore. It is something
[1:13:55] crowds in and and and then the important
[1:13:58] thing becomes neglected
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; or disregarded.
[1:14:02] And that's what Jesus was saying. He
[1:14:05] said, you've disregarded these important
[1:14:07] things and you've made you've made uh
[1:14:11] the things that are less important as
[1:14:14] being very important. And so he said
[1:14:17] you've left off judgment. And that
[1:14:19] judgment is that discerning between what
[1:14:22] really was important and what was not so
[1:14:25] important.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; And so that's what we're talking about
[1:14:29] this uh this discernment. And I'd like
[1:14:32] to also make a reference to the line of
[1:14:35] demarcation between what is important,
[1:14:38] what is not important. The line of
[1:14:41] demarcation
[1:14:43] between what is what is right, what is
[1:14:45] wrong.
[1:14:47] Hey, sometimes that's not a very very
[1:14:49] clear that's not a very clear line.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; You've all been there.
[1:14:54] uh you know what is right, what is
[1:14:56] wrong,
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; what is clean, what is unclean, what is
[1:15:00] holy, what is unholy because there gets
[1:15:02] to be areas that we are that we have to
[1:15:05] approach and are brought right in front
[1:15:08] of us and they they call it gray areas
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; and that's where we really need
[1:15:13] discernment because that's where Satan
[1:15:15] fosters those gray areas.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; So that's what we're that's what we're
[1:15:19] dealing with.
[1:15:21] So Jesus is saying here
[1:15:25] is not that they that they do not have
[1:15:28] judgment.
[1:15:30] He didn't say you don't have judgment.
[1:15:33] He said you've omitted it. You've
[1:15:34] neglected it. You do have it, but you
[1:15:37] don't use it.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; You see? And so willingly to willingly
[1:15:42] neglect or to forsake it or to disregard
[1:15:46] the judgment that God has given us. So
[1:15:49] it's entirely possible that we as
[1:15:51] believers,
[1:15:54] we come to areas of our lives where
[1:15:58] sometimes we don't know what to do.
[1:16:00] Sometimes we know what to do, but we
[1:16:03] procrastinate.
[1:16:05] You know what that word is?
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; We procrastinate the decision that we
[1:16:10] know we should make.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to ask you for your hands
[1:16:15] because we've all done it. And anybody
[1:16:17] wouldn't raise their hand. I don't think
[1:16:19] would be really honest with themselves.
[1:16:21] We said, "Well, I know I really need to
[1:16:23] I know I really need to say I'm sorry. I
[1:16:25] know I really need to say forgive me."
[1:16:28] And some may still be hanging here,
[1:16:30] still waiting on that one.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; I know I should really do this. I know I
[1:16:35] should really do that, but you know, I
[1:16:37] and and we can say, "Well, why are we
[1:16:39] not doing it?" Well, because we're just
[1:16:41] procrastinating. what we're doing is
[1:16:42] neglecting
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; from doing what we know we ought to do
[1:16:46] or saying what we know we ought to say.
[1:16:48] So it's the dividing line. But now the
[1:16:51] real line that I want to talk about now
[1:16:53] for the next short while is the dividing
[1:16:55] line between what is the world because
[1:16:59] the scripture says a great deal about
[1:17:02] the world.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; The uh I have I have the scriptures. I
[1:17:06] don't want to take the time but the
[1:17:08] Bible speaks about the cares of this
[1:17:10] world. The children of this world. Jesus
[1:17:13] said I am not of this world but he
[1:17:15] speaks of the prince of this world. The
[1:17:17] prince of this world he uses more than
[1:17:19] once. He speaks of the kingdom is not
[1:17:21] his kingdom is not of this world.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; He said where's the denter of this
[1:17:27] world? The world has dissenters. People
[1:17:29] that want to argue and then he and then
[1:17:32] the world has a wisdom and God has
[1:17:35] already called the wisdom of this world
[1:17:36] as foolishness.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; He says the princes of this world he
[1:17:41] refers to the wisdom of this world. He
[1:17:44] refers to the fashion of this world. He
[1:17:46] refers to the god of this world. He
[1:17:49] refers to the course of this world and
[1:17:51] the darkness of this world and the poor
[1:17:53] of this world. And he refers to his
[1:17:57] kingdom is not of this world but in the
[1:18:00] end of the scripture in revelation all
[1:18:02] the kingdoms of this world become his
[1:18:06] kingdom. Amen.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; So it's this world that I'm speaking
[1:18:11] about. And there is a line,
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; a line of demarcation,
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; amen,
[1:18:20] between what is of the world
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; and what is involves those that are in
[1:18:27] the world. Now, I've been uh I've been
[1:18:31] really stressing that we are in the
[1:18:34] world, but not of the world. And so,
[1:18:38] when does a thing
[1:18:42] become of the world
[1:18:46] or remain as an essential part of
[1:18:51] those of us who are in the world our
[1:18:54] lives.
[1:18:56] That's a big question. That's a very
[1:18:58] important question. I've taken all this
[1:19:00] time now to build up to really this
[1:19:03] critical spot. When is it
[1:19:06] that something that is
[1:19:10] essential part of our lives,
[1:19:14] I'll bring it down real simple. We're
[1:19:17] all dressed here this morning.
[1:19:21] We all have our garments on.
[1:19:25] And that is incredibly important.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Because without that, it would be
[1:19:30] sinful.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; It would be a shame. It would be a
[1:19:34] disgrace. But it's an amazing thing that
[1:19:38] while we are here clothed in our right
[1:19:42] minds
[1:19:44] that Satan can take that very thing
[1:19:47] that's an essential part of Christian
[1:19:50] living
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; and take it with a spirit of fashion
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; and move it on out
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; and impact
[1:20:01] lives of professing Christians and move
[1:20:05] them on out until they're enticed and
[1:20:07] enchanted
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; and and bring them garments that are
[1:20:13] ungodly
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; and are of the world
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; and bring that which is to clothe and to
[1:20:23] cause a person to be in holiness.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. and then as a moderate to dress in
[1:20:29] moderation and take them out in a and
[1:20:33] especially the lady of the world or the
[1:20:36] lady of of even the believers because
[1:20:39] it's a sacred body
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; that God has given certain graces for
[1:20:45] life
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; and for motherhood and Satan would like
[1:20:49] to take and cause that body to be one
[1:20:53] that would be looked upon and lusted
[1:20:55] after and bring it into condemnation
[1:20:58] just by the very way it's dressed.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Taking something that is of a godly
[1:21:05] essential part of our lives and bring it
[1:21:08] right on out until it's it's something
[1:21:10] that would bring condemnation and
[1:21:13] damnation upon the person.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; And to put it very very bluntly to take
[1:21:17] it from a godly place to where it would
[1:21:20] stand before God, brother Bram says as a
[1:21:21] prostitute. Right.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; So that's a long ways. Where's the line?
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Where's the line? I say it is it's God's
[1:21:30] responsibility to speak which he has and
[1:21:33] it's our responsibility to listen
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; and hear. When that voice gives that
[1:21:40] little signal inside
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; thus far and no further.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; You go beyond this line, you'll be of
[1:21:48] the world. If you stay on this side, you
[1:21:52] are in the world. But if you go over
[1:21:54] here, you're of the world. It's the
[1:21:56] world that does this. And so what what
[1:21:59] was godly yesterday can be worldly
[1:22:03] tomorrow. That's right.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says that a woman's body
[1:22:15] has been given these graces
[1:22:18] and Satan is, you know, he's the
[1:22:20] designer of fashion.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Satan is the designer of fashion. So, he
[1:22:26] wants to accentuate the movement of this
[1:22:31] sacred body.
[1:22:33] wants to show the form of it and wants
[1:22:37] to cast it out before the world
[1:22:42] and bring it down into disrepute. I say
[1:22:46] that's an incredible just an incredible
[1:22:49] disgrace that he's trying to impose upon
[1:22:54] uh we're not talking about we're not
[1:22:56] talking about uh the the those that are
[1:22:58] sinners already. He's already got those.
[1:23:01] But upon believers That's right.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Now, that is just uh that's just a a
[1:23:07] small part.
[1:23:09] Now, Jesus said
[1:23:12] in his prayer in John 17, I'm only going
[1:23:15] to read four scriptures. He says, "And
[1:23:19] now I am no more, I want you to catch
[1:23:21] this, in the world, of the world. I am
[1:23:23] no more in the world, but these are in
[1:23:27] the world. And I come to thee, holy
[1:23:30] father, keep through thine own name
[1:23:34] those whom thou hast given me that they
[1:23:37] may be one as we are. Verse 14, I have
[1:23:41] given them thy word and the world hath
[1:23:44] hated them because they are not of the
[1:23:48] world.
[1:23:50] Even as I am not of the world, I pray
[1:23:55] not that thou shouldest take them out of
[1:23:58] the world, but that thou shouldest keep
[1:24:00] them from the evil. Where's the evil?
[1:24:04] It's in the world.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Verse 16, they are not of the world,
[1:24:10] even as I am not of the world, but they
[1:24:14] are in the world. These are in the
[1:24:16] world. Keep them.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. While they're in the world, keep
[1:24:19] them.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can you say amen?
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; While they're in the world, keep them
[1:24:25] from the evil.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus said
[1:24:30] in John, he was speaking to the same
[1:24:32] religious leaders, John 8:23, and he
[1:24:34] said unto them, you are from beneath. I
[1:24:37] am from above. You are of this world. I
[1:24:41] am not of this world. There's a
[1:24:44] incredible statement. Drinks the same
[1:24:45] water. They drink. eats the same food
[1:24:48] they and dressed with the garment like
[1:24:50] they're dressed and all of these things
[1:24:53] looked entirely to be in the world the
[1:24:55] same as they're in the world or of the
[1:24:56] world like they're of the world. But he
[1:24:58] says, "I'm from above. You're from
[1:25:00] beneath. You're of this world. I'm not
[1:25:02] of this world. There's a distinct line.
[1:25:05] You can't you can't homogenize that. You
[1:25:08] can't make that some indefinable line.
[1:25:11] That's a clear line.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; You're of the world. I'm not of this
[1:25:15] world."
[1:25:16] Hallelujah.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; And we've got to be able to say that and
[1:25:19] feel that witness within our own heart.
[1:25:22] I am not of this world. Amen.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; In a message contending for the faith,
[1:25:32] he said, "No matter what it seems like
[1:25:35] and what others say, the religion of
[1:25:38] Jesus Christ has never been popular
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; and it never will be popular because the
[1:25:47] world knows its own and you are not of
[1:25:51] the world when you become a Christian.
[1:25:55] You are a different person from the
[1:25:57] world. And we know that.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; You know that. But I want to
[1:26:03] re-emphasize it. You are not of this
[1:26:05] world.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; This message is not of this world. It
[1:26:10] didn't come from this world. It didn't
[1:26:12] come hatched up in a Bible school or
[1:26:15] some school of theology. It came as
[1:26:18] Apostle Paul's doctrine came. And it's
[1:26:21] the same as Apostle Paul's doctrine. It
[1:26:24] came by revelation.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And not only that, Apostle Paul went
[1:26:30] now, he was gone for years and he came
[1:26:32] back, just reading it last night, came
[1:26:34] back to Jerusalem and consulted with the
[1:26:36] other apostles who had been with Jesus
[1:26:39] Christ and who had recorded his words.
[1:26:43] And they found that what Apostle Paul
[1:26:45] received by revelation and what they had
[1:26:47] heard from the mouth of Jesus was
[1:26:50] exactly the same thing.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Now if they had already heard it, why
[1:26:54] did it need to come by revelation? It's
[1:26:56] because God is a God that reveals
[1:26:59] himself and that is how he instructs and
[1:27:02] that's why Apostle Paul became the
[1:27:04] apostle to the Gentiles.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Even more so than the apostles who heard
[1:27:09] the word from the lips of Jesus Christ.
[1:27:12] Amen.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "I pray
[1:27:16] I pray, Father, that they not be of the
[1:27:19] world, so you're not of the world."
[1:27:24] Now these various areas of our lives,
[1:27:28] Paul said to Titus, teaching us that
[1:27:31] denying ungodly and worldly lusts, we
[1:27:34] should live soberly, righteously, and
[1:27:36] godly in this present age, this world,
[1:27:42] which is a a the an arrangement or the
[1:27:46] the this cosmos,
[1:27:49] but having the character this worldly.
[1:27:52] It says a little bit differently that
[1:27:55] the denying ungodliness and worldly lust
[1:28:00] or worldly is those things having the
[1:28:04] character of this corrupt age that we
[1:28:06] are in.
[1:28:09] Now I I want to take worship for a
[1:28:11] moment.
[1:28:14] There is a true worship
[1:28:17] that is in this world and there's a
[1:28:20] worship that's of the world. Now, if you
[1:28:23] take your Bibles, would you please turn
[1:28:25] to Numbers the 21st chapter
[1:28:30] and we're going to read just a few
[1:28:31] verses here.
[1:28:36] Numbers 21. And we're going to start to
[1:28:39] read at verse one.
[1:28:42] And when King Aar the Canaanite, which
[1:28:45] dwelt in the south, heard tell that
[1:28:48] Israel came by the way of the spies,
[1:28:52] then he fought against Israel, and took
[1:28:54] some of them prisoners.
[1:28:56] And Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord,
[1:28:58] and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver
[1:29:02] this people into my hand, then I will
[1:29:05] utterly destroy their cities. And the
[1:29:07] Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel
[1:29:10] and delivered up the Canaanites. And
[1:29:12] they entirely destroyed them in their
[1:29:15] cities. And he called the name of the
[1:29:16] place Horma.
[1:29:18] And they journeyed from Mount by
[1:29:22] the way of the Red Sea to come past the
[1:29:24] land of Edom. And the soul of the people
[1:29:28] was much discouraged because of the way.
[1:29:30] I just want you to look this way for
[1:29:32] just a moment. Now, this we're at a
[1:29:35] critical spot here. Now they have prayed
[1:29:38] to God, we need this victory over this
[1:29:42] evil king and if you will do this for
[1:29:46] us, we will serve you and we will
[1:29:49] destroy this wickedness. We'll cleanse
[1:29:51] it out and we will destroy all their
[1:29:54] cities and so on. But then the people
[1:29:56] journeyed after that victory and all of
[1:29:59] us have experienced marvelous victories.
[1:30:01] He journeyied after that victory and
[1:30:03] they became wearied with the way
[1:30:08] just normal life. There was no other
[1:30:11] great battles that they had to they just
[1:30:14] become wearied with life. And I can say
[1:30:16] here there's not a man or a woman that
[1:30:19] has begun to assume the responsibilities
[1:30:22] of life that at some point in time
[1:30:25] you're not always dancing around and
[1:30:27] skipping along the way. You get weary
[1:30:29] with life.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; You just plain get weary. Young people
[1:30:33] that go to school and they go with their
[1:30:36] big bags of their uh of their homework
[1:30:39] and they've got they've got projects to
[1:30:41] do and they've got to study and make
[1:30:44] them get themselves ready. I don't care
[1:30:46] what area of life it is in. Uh it may be
[1:30:48] a wonderful life. You may be fit and in
[1:30:51] good health, but you become wearied with
[1:30:53] the way.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; You can be silent if you want. But I
[1:30:58] know that's the case.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; And and that happens to be when that
[1:31:03] happens, you have to be very very alert
[1:31:06] and very very discerning because that
[1:31:08] gives opportunity for Satan to to come
[1:31:11] in and and then people, you know what,
[1:31:13] they need discernment at that time. And
[1:31:15] I'll tell you why. Because things begin
[1:31:18] to kind of go reversal. this isn't my
[1:31:20] expectations haven't really been met in
[1:31:22] this relationship or in this marriage or
[1:31:24] in this home or in this church or in my
[1:31:27] employment or whatever more and uh and
[1:31:30] uh for whatever reason and at a time
[1:31:32] like that then suddenly uh if you
[1:31:35] haven't got the exact correct godly
[1:31:38] discernment if you don't if you're not
[1:31:40] careful you start blaming the wrong
[1:31:43] thing
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; the wrong person
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; you know what I mean
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; say Well, while this is happening, maybe
[1:31:50] it's, you know, uh, uh, who I'm working
[1:31:52] with, it's their fault, not my fault, or
[1:31:55] it's the boss's fault, or somebody below
[1:31:57] me fault, or somebody in the church's
[1:31:59] fault, or it's the deacon's fault, or
[1:32:01] the preacher's fault, or it's my wife's
[1:32:03] fault, or it's it's my somebody's fault.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; But maybe that's not the case at all.
[1:32:09] You just become weary in the way. And
[1:32:11] you got to kind of uh uh gather your
[1:32:14] resources together and say, "I'm a
[1:32:16] believer. I'm a son and daughter of God
[1:32:19] and I'm not going to lie. I am at this
[1:32:21] spot. I am at this difficulty, but God's
[1:32:24] going to see me through it.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; I'm a real spiritual Israelite. I'm a
[1:32:31] son of God. I'm going to come through
[1:32:33] and I'm going to crest every wave
[1:32:36] according to the prophet's promise.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Everybody gets wearied with the way. But
[1:32:43] when they got wearied with the way, the
[1:32:45] people spake against God. Verse five,
[1:32:49] they begin to blame the wrong person
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; just because they were weary.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; And they blame blame God and they blamed
[1:33:00] Moses. Wherefore have you brought us up
[1:33:03] out of Egypt to die in this wilderness?
[1:33:06] These people just come through great
[1:33:08] victory. You know, it's always been
[1:33:10] amazing to me how soon people can forget
[1:33:14] the grace of God in their lives. How
[1:33:17] soon they can forget the mighty
[1:33:20] deliverance that they have experienced.
[1:33:22] And how soon they can forget the pains
[1:33:25] and pains of sin
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; and forget how desolate it was, how dark
[1:33:32] it was, how confusing it was, and the
[1:33:36] terribleness of sin and the darkness
[1:33:38] that you were in and the bondage that
[1:33:40] you were in. Don't forget Egypt friends.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; And don't forget the marvelous
[1:33:46] deliverance that God gave you.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he broke the chains and
[1:33:52] set you free.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Don't forget that.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; But they got wearied in the way. And by
[1:33:59] getting we wearied, they began to
[1:34:03] complain against the wrong ones.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Wasn't their fault at all. What they
[1:34:08] should have said, you know what? This is
[1:34:10] the tough way.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; They should have said to one another,
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; "Let me have your hand, brother. We're
[1:34:15] going to make it.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; We're going to make it.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; We've got the word. We've got the
[1:34:20] prophet of God. We've got thus says the
[1:34:23] Lord, and he didn't bring us out here to
[1:34:25] die. He brought us out here to go into a
[1:34:27] land, and we're going to go into it."
[1:34:30] Hallelujah. God didn't bring us here to
[1:34:32] wither out in Leodysia. He brought us
[1:34:35] here to go across in the rapture.
[1:34:38] That's why he brought you here.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; If he didn't, then we ought to close the
[1:34:42] doors, close the service, go home, eat,
[1:34:44] drink, and be merry, and have a best
[1:34:46] time that you possibly can.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; But we are not of the world. We are in
[1:34:51] the world. But we're not of this world.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; But because we are because we are in the
[1:34:57] world, we are interacting with it. We
[1:34:59] are affected by it and afflicted by it
[1:35:02] from time to time and become weary with
[1:35:04] it.
[1:35:07] And so they complained against God,
[1:35:09] complained against Moses. And the Lord
[1:35:12] sent fiery verse six. Verse six. And the
[1:35:16] Lord sent fiery serpents among the
[1:35:18] people,
[1:35:20] and they bit the people,
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; and much people of Israel died. Amen.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Therefore, the people came to Moses and
[1:35:28] said,
[1:35:30] "We have sinned,
[1:35:32] and we have spoken against the Lord and
[1:35:35] against you.
[1:35:37] Pray unto the Lord that he may take away
[1:35:40] the serpents from us." And Moses prayed
[1:35:43] for the people. And the Lord said unto
[1:35:46] Moses, "Make thee a fiery serpent, and
[1:35:48] set it upon a pole. And it shall come to
[1:35:50] pass that everyone that is bitten when
[1:35:52] he lookth upon it shall live. And Moses
[1:35:56] made a serpent of brass and put it upon
[1:35:58] the pole. And it came to pass that if a
[1:36:02] serpent had bitten any man when he
[1:36:04] beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
[1:36:09] Brother Bram says in God identifying
[1:36:11] himself,
[1:36:13] God's characteristics identified in
[1:36:15] Moses, a pillar of fire was following
[1:36:18] him. He also had the atonement in
[1:36:21] action.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Not speaking of it, but he had it in
[1:36:25] action.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't just speak about the
[1:36:27] atonement. He had it there working.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; He says, "Not what will be, but what is
[1:36:34] right now." Now notice he had a brass
[1:36:35] serpent and that being had been lifted
[1:36:39] up for the sickness and diseases of the
[1:36:42] people. Therefore, Moses was practicing
[1:36:45] divine healing.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; It wasn't some, you know, uh, educated
[1:36:53] people that were helping them when these
[1:36:55] vipers or these serpents bit them. He
[1:36:57] had he had divine healing. The prophet
[1:37:00] said he had atonement. The brass serpent
[1:37:03] symbolizing that God was in the camp.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; The brass serpent
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; that was lifted up on a pole symbolized
[1:37:11] that God was in the camp and they just
[1:37:13] had to look on it
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; and they were healed.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Wasn't that simple?
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; I've been bit.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Look in the wrong direction. Look this
[1:37:20] way and see it
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; and you're healed.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Simple. All I had to do was believe it.
[1:37:27] Amen.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; That's all they had to do is believe it.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; If they said, "Uh, you know, I don't
[1:37:34] believe it. I don't accept that. I'm
[1:37:36] just going to look here. I'm going to
[1:37:37] stare at the ground. I'm going to I'm
[1:37:38] going to suck this bite. I'm going to
[1:37:40] get rid of this venom myself." They
[1:37:42] died.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; I've been told by my grandparents that
[1:37:46] when you get bit, you need Next fellow
[1:37:48] says, "Well, uh,
[1:37:51] what's this got to do with that brass
[1:37:52] serpent?"
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; I mean, this is a live bite. And that's
[1:37:57] a live snake. And my granddaddy told me
[1:38:01] in our religion that if I just cut that
[1:38:03] a wee bit and suck it and press it and
[1:38:06] do this and do that and do the other
[1:38:07] thing and put some pus on it, it will
[1:38:09] draw that venom out and I'm going to
[1:38:11] live. He died.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; He died with all of his reasoning and
[1:38:15] all of his efforts. But if you just look
[1:38:17] to the brass serpent, they had divine
[1:38:19] healing in the camp and God was in the
[1:38:21] camp and atonement was in the camp and
[1:38:23] they were healed of it. Amen.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; They kept that brass serpent
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; until finally there was a king on down
[1:38:32] the road.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; And that king inherited this serpent,
[1:38:37] this brass serpent. And he was a godly
[1:38:40] king. His name was Hezekiah.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; And he inherited this brass serpent in
[1:38:46] his uh in his reign. And it came to pass
[1:38:48] in the third year of Hosa, son of Elah,
[1:38:52] king of Israel, that Hezekiah, the son
[1:38:54] of Ahaz, king of Judah, began to reign.
[1:38:57] He was 25 years old when he began to
[1:38:59] reign. Say young man. He was 25. I show
[1:39:02] you what a 25-year-old boy can do. Young
[1:39:05] man, not boy, but a young man.
[1:39:10] And uh 25 years old when he began to
[1:39:13] reign. and he reigned 29 years
[1:39:17] in Jerusalem.
[1:39:19] And his mother's name was Abi, the
[1:39:22] daughter of Zachchariah.
[1:39:24] And he did that which was right in the
[1:39:26] sight of God, in the sight of the Lord,
[1:39:28] according to all that his father David
[1:39:31] did. And he removed the high places and
[1:39:35] break the images and cut down the
[1:39:38] groves. This all had to do with worship.
[1:39:41] And he destroyed the images and he cut
[1:39:43] down the groves because they used to go
[1:39:44] in the places where the trees they were
[1:39:46] very very highly regarded. And uh and he
[1:39:49] cut down the groves, special places
[1:39:51] where they would go for their worship.
[1:39:53] And he break in pieces the brazen
[1:39:55] serpent that Moses had made. For unto
[1:39:59] those days the children of Israel did
[1:40:01] burn incense
[1:40:04] to it and called it Neah.
[1:40:10] the very serpent that God raised up
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; as a emblem of atonement and divine
[1:40:18] healing.
[1:40:20] They took that and they kept it of
[1:40:22] course because God had never told them
[1:40:25] whether to destroy it or what to do. But
[1:40:27] that thing which was of God evolved in
[1:40:31] their worship and in their lives until
[1:40:34] they begin to give it a place it was not
[1:40:36] supposed to have. And that brass serpent
[1:40:39] became an idol.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon makes quite a few
[1:40:47] references to it.
[1:40:51] Get this
[1:40:54] perhaps even becoming
[1:40:56] a little more difficult for you. But
[1:40:59] Jesus,
[1:41:01] he said in in a in uh I'll just I'll
[1:41:05] just read it for you.
[1:41:10] after this one amazing amazing scripture
[1:41:14] which we love so dearly.
[1:41:18] And no man hath ascended
[1:41:21] up to heaven, but he that came down from
[1:41:24] heaven, even the son of man which is in
[1:41:27] heaven.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Marvelous scripture. The next verse
[1:41:31] says, "And as Moses lifted up the
[1:41:36] serpent in the wilderness, even so must
[1:41:39] the Son of Man be lifted up." Here Jesus
[1:41:44] is identifying himself
[1:41:47] with the serpent that was lifted up in
[1:41:50] the wilderness because it was it was a
[1:41:53] brass being an emblem of judgment,
[1:41:56] divine judgment. And Jesus was going to
[1:41:58] uh take upon himself all the judgment,
[1:42:02] the divine judgment for all of us.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Your judgment's gone, friend, because
[1:42:07] Christ bore it.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; But as a and so it actually typified
[1:42:14] Christ and yet they took that thing.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; That was lifted up for the sickness of
[1:42:22] the people. And the Bible says, I'm
[1:42:25] sorry, in the in the message, it says in
[1:42:27] the in God manifesting his gifts, it
[1:42:29] says, "And the brass serpents in the
[1:42:31] wilderness, the brass serpent in the
[1:42:33] wilderness, the people looked and lived,
[1:42:36] that was a type of Christ. And if the
[1:42:39] type healed them, what will the antitype
[1:42:42] do?
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; If the brass serpent made like unto the
[1:42:47] son of God who was made sin, the serpent
[1:42:51] was an emblem of sin. brass the
[1:42:54] judgment. So the brass serpent was a
[1:42:57] emblem of sin and of judgment and and if
[1:43:01] looking on at that serpent they lived
[1:43:04] what of them looking at the Christ
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; and live
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; in the one true living church. I need to
[1:43:17] just get a couple more quotes. As Moses
[1:43:20] lift up the serpent in the wilderness,
[1:43:22] so must the son of man the same reason.
[1:43:26] And now that serpent was God's provided
[1:43:29] way for healing for many, many years.
[1:43:34] And after the serpent, the people got to
[1:43:37] worshiping the image
[1:43:43] instead of what it stood for.
[1:43:46] I want you got your thinking caps on
[1:43:48] now. They begin to worship the image,
[1:43:51] the structure of the thing instead of
[1:43:54] what it stood for.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; It says you can make a god out of
[1:44:00] anything.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; You can make a god out of your wife, out
[1:44:03] of your husband.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; You make a god out of the piano.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; You make a god out of anything.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Because it begins to take a place. It's
[1:44:14] not not what it stands for but you make
[1:44:17] a and it becomes an image within itself
[1:44:23] and he says uh
[1:44:28] and after the serpent the people got to
[1:44:31] worshiping the image the serpent instead
[1:44:33] of what it stood for and that brought
[1:44:36] the people under idolatry in the
[1:44:39] uncertain sound. These sound similar
[1:44:41] now. The brass serpent was all right.
[1:44:45] See, the brass serpent was all right.
[1:44:48] There was no condemnation in the brass
[1:44:50] serpent. But when they begin to get away
[1:44:52] from God and worship the serpent, the
[1:44:55] prophet tore it up
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; being led by the Holy Spirit.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now look at the serpent. The
[1:45:02] the brass serpent in the wilderness. Did
[1:45:05] you know the prophet had to tear that
[1:45:07] serpent to pieces? Why? Because the
[1:45:09] people were worshiping the serpent and
[1:45:11] they made an idol out of it. He said,
[1:45:14] "Do you believe you can do it today? You
[1:45:16] can make an idol out of your church. You
[1:45:19] can make an idol out of your pastor. You
[1:45:21] can make an idol out of the out of an
[1:45:23] evangelist." He says, "And I'm afraid
[1:45:25] that there's a whole lot of it's being
[1:45:28] done." They idolize the man.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; What about What about a sports idol?
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; They're not ashamed to call it an idol.
[1:45:38] What about a movie star idol?
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; What about a television star idol?
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; What about a politician idol? Whatever
[1:45:45] it is, you can idolize and they begin to
[1:45:48] idle idolize the image of the person.
[1:45:52] Not necessarily their physique and so
[1:45:53] on, but they begin to idolize it. And
[1:45:56] rather than and some of it now is
[1:45:59] strictly of the world. But my message
[1:46:02] this morning and I hope that you are
[1:46:04] really being able to lay hold of it is
[1:46:08] I'm not concerned of those things that
[1:46:10] are of the world. Let them be out there.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; But there are things which
[1:46:16] are essential. I call them essential.
[1:46:20] Your job is essential.
[1:46:23] Your education is essential.
[1:46:26] I've I have dealt with people who
[1:46:30] commence their education and I would say
[1:46:32] it was their education essential let's
[1:46:34] say absolutely
[1:46:37] was further education essential I would
[1:46:40] say in many cases absolutely and today
[1:46:43] more so than in the past
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; and I would say you know get whatever
[1:46:49] education you can but can education
[1:46:51] become an idol I'd say absolutely
[1:46:55] Amen.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; I have dealt with people who are way up
[1:46:59] in years and have become professional
[1:47:02] students.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; And there's a, you know, there's just a
[1:47:07] like a a a hunger, a hankering, a
[1:47:10] thirsting, a yearning for more and more
[1:47:13] and more and more knowledge and perhaps
[1:47:16] with no special direction to it. Now, I
[1:47:18] don't think that's something that
[1:47:20] plagues us here. But on the other hand,
[1:47:22] on the other hand, that is exactly what
[1:47:26] I'm I'm bringing to you is that there
[1:47:28] are things that are an essential part of
[1:47:31] our life, but it it begins to and when
[1:47:34] does it become a god? When it begins to
[1:47:37] control you
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; and tell you what you can do and what
[1:47:42] you can't do instead of you telling it
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; what you're going to do.
[1:47:48] Now, brother Brandham says, "Now,
[1:47:51] idolatry is a strange thing." He says,
[1:47:54] "Now, the order for this idol worship is
[1:47:56] the man that sets up an idol. He fixes
[1:48:00] the idol. Then he goes in and prepares
[1:48:02] himself for this great worship." Now, he
[1:48:05] believes that this idol is made in the
[1:48:08] image of some god that he has never
[1:48:12] seen, and he's he's without form. So he
[1:48:16] believes in the image of the idol that
[1:48:19] it makes that he makes to his god.
[1:48:26] And he says, "Now don't let that leave
[1:48:28] you. The image is the image is in the
[1:48:31] image of the mythical god that he
[1:48:34] believes that it is."
[1:48:38] Now I was I was reading where it was
[1:48:41] saying
[1:48:45] that there is in every human mind
[1:48:49] a craving for visible forms to express
[1:48:53] religious conceptions
[1:48:55] and this tendency does not disappear
[1:48:58] with the acceptance or even with the
[1:49:01] constant recognition of the pure
[1:49:03] spiritual truths.
[1:49:06] It's really amazing
[1:49:08] to me how that uh and I think that uh
[1:49:12] perhaps uh the younger portion of the
[1:49:15] congregation may have more uh I'm not
[1:49:19] too sure but they may have more
[1:49:21] care that needs to be taken along these
[1:49:23] lines.
[1:49:25] Uh I don't know how many of you maybe
[1:49:27] get the National Geographic but we've
[1:49:29] gotten the National Geographic since so
[1:49:32] many years I don't want to even think
[1:49:33] about them. But the last one they of all
[1:49:38] things usually it has something to do
[1:49:39] with you know nature and so on there
[1:49:41] they get on to the soccer game soccer
[1:49:46] if you read the first page which I
[1:49:48] hadn't read. My wife said you ought to
[1:49:50] read this first page. She didn't know
[1:49:52] what I was studying. She said they've
[1:49:55] made they say right in there that soccer
[1:49:59] in Europe especially is an absolute
[1:50:02] religion.
[1:50:05] And they they quote a scripture.
[1:50:09] They quote a scripture
[1:50:12] and it just just slips me right now. But
[1:50:14] it they quote a scripture and thou it's
[1:50:18] like something like thou has done great
[1:50:20] things wherever we are glad or something
[1:50:22] like that.
[1:50:23] And they just bring it right down. And
[1:50:26] they bring the whole article completely
[1:50:29] filled with spiritual
[1:50:32] connection all the way through,
[1:50:35] showing that it is literally a religion.
[1:50:38] And to show that that it's it demands
[1:50:42] the devotion of the people as does
[1:50:45] religion.
[1:50:47] And then they even take a knock at
[1:50:48] religion. They said a and it makes
[1:50:51] people violent as does religion
[1:50:57] and they will expend themselves and do
[1:51:00] whatever they need to do as will
[1:51:02] religion.
[1:51:05] But I think they took a whack at
[1:51:06] religion saying well but but they don't
[1:51:09] get to a soccer game and tried to devise
[1:51:12] a way to kill another nation
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; as does religion.
[1:51:20] And it was really incredible. And you
[1:51:22] talk about devotion. I mean, and it
[1:51:24] actually becomes political because one
[1:51:27] nation against another
[1:51:30] uh and and how they'll finally meet.
[1:51:32] They've been in opposition and they and
[1:51:34] bitter hatred for years. But then the
[1:51:37] two teams of those bitter nations will
[1:51:41] meet on the soccer field and a whole
[1:51:43] political process starts of of kind of
[1:51:46] healing and bringing those two nations
[1:51:48] together.
[1:51:49] But if the one team if the wrong team
[1:51:52] wins, they've got a riot and they got a
[1:51:55] political almost war going on.
[1:51:59] Now don't tell me that they haven't made
[1:52:02] a religion out of it.
[1:52:04] Don't tell me that they haven't made
[1:52:05] idols out of those people.
[1:52:09] You know, this may seem very distant and
[1:52:13] and far from you, but it is it's
[1:52:16] astounding to me
[1:52:19] how that those people who you don't say
[1:52:22] are a star to you, but how the effect of
[1:52:26] how they act
[1:52:29] and the way they speak
[1:52:32] and the kind of music they listen to and
[1:52:36] how they dress and perhaps just even the
[1:52:38] way they wear their clothes or how it
[1:52:40] does how it seems to permeate
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; down through the whole society until
[1:52:47] someone who's innocently living in the
[1:52:50] world and is a believer on the Lord
[1:52:54] Jesus Christ and as a walks in the light
[1:52:57] of the message but that thing permeates
[1:53:00] and s sets its tentacles right down and
[1:53:04] comes into your home
[1:53:06] by a magazine,
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; by a newspaper, by an advertisement of
[1:53:11] somehow and Satan is there trying to
[1:53:14] capture a a little bit of your mind.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Ah, that's the thing to do. Oh, you
[1:53:20] really need that.
[1:53:24] Are you with me?
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; That's really true. That's very, very
[1:53:30] true. And that is where we need
[1:53:32] discernment. Amen.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; We need the discernment of God.
[1:53:42] Now,
[1:53:44] I have I'm going to be closing shortly,
[1:53:46] but I have I have followed through with
[1:53:50] last week's service, the way to your
[1:53:53] matters. And I want this to be part two.
[1:53:56] But I have a subject that I want to give
[1:53:59] you now that I've called. The subject
[1:54:02] for this morning's service is the gods
[1:54:05] of Leodysia.
[1:54:07] And the longer we live in this age, I
[1:54:12] would say the keener the discernment we
[1:54:14] need.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Jesus said these words and we we know it
[1:54:24] so well. Behold, I stand at the door and
[1:54:27] knock. If any man hear my voice and open
[1:54:30] the door, I will come into him and will
[1:54:33] s with him and he with me. Oh, a lot of
[1:54:37] people like to make this the door of
[1:54:38] your heart. He was trying to get into
[1:54:40] the whole age through the messenger. He
[1:54:43] was saying, "Behold, I stand the door
[1:54:45] and knock. If any man hear my voice and
[1:54:48] open the door, I will come into him and
[1:54:50] s with him and he with me, they will
[1:54:51] have fellowship." That that's they they
[1:54:53] will have a a a fellowship together. My
[1:54:57] question is, what were the people doing
[1:54:58] that were inside?
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; He was outside,
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; They had a form of worship. They were
[1:55:05] worshiping.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; There was worship going on in there.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; But I can tell you it was vain worship.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; It was worship of the world.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; But not by true worshippers that are
[1:55:19] still in the world. It was of the world.
[1:55:22] And obviously Jesus Christ was not the
[1:55:25] one being worshiped because he was
[1:55:28] outside.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; You get my point? Amen.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; So inside they're obviously worshiping
[1:55:33] and in the message how can I overcome
[1:55:36] the prophet says and then look at
[1:55:37] Leodysian church age after it has
[1:55:40] received the Holy Ghost and with the
[1:55:43] knowledge of the spirit of God within it
[1:55:45] and then the works of God is denied by
[1:55:47] it and it's called an evil work. Then
[1:55:50] what about that? There's where Christ
[1:55:52] was put out of his own church. It it
[1:55:56] never showed him in the church until it
[1:55:59] came to never showed him in the church
[1:56:01] until it came to Leodysia. And when he
[1:56:04] got to Leodysia, he'd been put out of
[1:56:07] his church trying to get back in.
[1:56:19] Now,
[1:56:24] I had had just spoken a little bit
[1:56:26] earlier of a fashion. I brought it
[1:56:29] because I wanted to get your thoughts
[1:56:31] right into right into the uh into the
[1:56:34] subject.
[1:56:36] Now, brother Brandham says in Jehovah
[1:56:38] Gyra.
[1:56:39] He said, "I was trying to find Oral
[1:56:41] Roberts this morning on the television
[1:56:43] that sits in my room and I finally found
[1:56:46] it and I went ahead and I was taking a
[1:56:49] bath and shaving and so on." He says, "I
[1:56:52] I I looked upon the he says went out to
[1:56:54] see what was going on and my said the
[1:56:59] most ungodly things trying to advertise
[1:57:02] skirts for women and said it showed
[1:57:06] every move of their body. God making a
[1:57:10] woman such a high thing that she is and
[1:57:15] would degrade her mind." Now, I want you
[1:57:18] to see, please, this congregation and
[1:57:21] all who are listening and streaming.
[1:57:23] Now, we we don't just have a man there
[1:57:26] looking at it. Now, we've got a
[1:57:28] prophetic eyes.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Now, you you might have looked at it.
[1:57:33] You might have looked at it and maybe
[1:57:35] it'd been disappointing to you or
[1:57:37] disgusting to you or repulsive to you
[1:57:40] and you'd just say, "That's that's so
[1:57:42] repulsive."
[1:57:43] you know, and make you upset or whatever
[1:57:46] more. But now catch this place.
[1:57:51] He say he's seeing it a little bit
[1:57:53] differently and see what's going on. And
[1:57:56] my the most the most ungodly thing,
[1:58:01] trying to advertise skirts for women
[1:58:04] that showed every move of their body.
[1:58:09] God making now here he says on the one's
[1:58:12] hand God making
[1:58:16] uh such a high thing that she is lifting
[1:58:19] her up such a high thing that she is and
[1:58:23] now he's on the other side and would
[1:58:25] degrade her mind when God put a sheepkin
[1:58:29] over to hide her and she went and she
[1:58:33] went a knitted dress to show every form
[1:58:37] of her body.
[1:58:40] Now, you know what this ended up doing?
[1:58:43] I tell you very plainly.
[1:58:45] America went the direction and I can
[1:58:47] give you
[1:58:49] I can give you quote after quote after
[1:58:51] quote until she became a goddess.
[1:58:56] Satan was successful at taking
[1:59:01] a body that was given for bringing life,
[1:59:07] bringing life into the earth
[1:59:10] and and causing it to become something
[1:59:15] that would be looked upon
[1:59:17] and bring it to such a degraded place,
[1:59:20] something that God had lifted up. Then
[1:59:22] people have the audacity to say,
[1:59:23] "Brother Brandham hated women."
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; That's a lie.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; He said he's he's standing there with
[1:59:31] truth because he said, "I love them.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; I love them with a godly love.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; I He doesn't want to see that happen."
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; And so now here's something. You see my
[1:59:42] point? Here's something that's I'm
[1:59:44] trying to bring a protection to this
[1:59:45] congregation.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to bring something of
[1:59:47] protection to our young people, our
[1:59:49] young ladies. When you go out there and
[1:59:52] you go shopping in these stores,
[1:59:54] remember Satan is the designer.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; He has designed it. And you need to ask
[2:00:01] yourself, is this going to bring me uh
[2:00:03] be is this going to bring me before the
[2:00:05] public and cause God to be disappointed
[2:00:10] and cause the Holy Spirit to be grieved?
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; When when he's actually bringing this
[2:00:17] for my protection,
[2:00:20] Amen.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; I know it may be quiet, but it's
[2:00:24] absolute truth.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; And there's a godly way to approach
[2:00:28] that. And for men as well.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. For men as well out there.
[2:00:34] We're not here to to hit the fashion
[2:00:37] standard.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; We're here to be modest. We're here to
[2:00:41] be properly clothed. We're here to be
[2:00:44] clean. I believe that sisters, you know,
[2:00:46] even the prophet says they like to look
[2:00:48] lovely and I think that they should. I
[2:00:51] think that's perfectly fine. But when
[2:00:53] you say anything, this is going to
[2:00:54] accentuate my body or accentuate a part
[2:00:57] of my body. This is going to bring me
[2:01:00] out in front of the eyes of lusting men
[2:01:03] and not only man,
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; the lusting world.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; And by God's grace, I'm I'm drawing a
[2:01:11] line.
[2:01:14] by the Holy Spirit.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; There's a line and I feel in my soul I
[2:01:21] feel comfortable. I feel at peace on
[2:01:25] this side and this is pushing the
[2:01:28] boundary too far
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to deny it. I love the
[2:01:32] thing. I love the garment. I love the
[2:01:35] make. I love the tag. I love the
[2:01:37] manufacturer. whatever more but I'm
[2:01:39] denying that because it's pushing the
[2:01:42] boundary
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; the heaven
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; and it moves it from I am I am I am in
[2:01:48] the world but I'm not of the world and
[2:01:50] I've come now to the conclusion this is
[2:01:53] of the world
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; and that applies to all the areas of our
[2:02:01] lives it could be my job it could be my
[2:02:04] business it could be any part and Satan
[2:02:08] is in every part of it. He's the God of
[2:02:10] this evil age.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; And as being God of this evil age, he
[2:02:17] wants to he wants the the bowing. He
[2:02:20] wants to be uh have obesence. He wants
[2:02:24] to be served.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; And that's that's exactly the direction
[2:02:29] that it takes.
[2:02:40] But with this I close
[2:02:46] in Daniel's day.
[2:02:50] They raised up an image
[2:02:55] and it was a forced worship.
[2:03:00] It was a forced worship. This is not
[2:03:02] easy for me to say, but brother Brandon
[2:03:05] talks about it being a force to worship
[2:03:07] in the end time. And what they this this
[2:03:10] image that they raised up actually image
[2:03:13] to Daniel raised him up said everybody's
[2:03:17] got to worship this.
[2:03:19] That same spirit, that's the spirit
[2:03:21] that's in the land today.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; That's the spirit the Bible says. In
[2:03:25] fact, as it finally concludes, you I
[2:03:27] want want you to think about this very
[2:03:29] deeply. The Bible finally concludes that
[2:03:31] there's an image to the beast that is
[2:03:33] raised up
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; in the book of Revelation.
[2:03:39] And the Bible says, "All
[2:03:42] whose names are not in the book,
[2:03:48] worship the beast."
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; All whose names are not in the book of
[2:03:54] life of the lamb, worship the beast.
[2:03:58] Listen friends, this whole thing is not
[2:04:00] about buying homes and you know having a
[2:04:03] job and buying a car and going place.
[2:04:06] This whole thing, the whole thing is
[2:04:08] about worship.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; What you're going to bow to, what you're
[2:04:11] going to serve, that's what it's all
[2:04:12] about.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; And you want to go out these doors today
[2:04:15] and say, I serve Christ. I serve this
[2:04:18] word. I bow to this word. I bow to the
[2:04:22] Christ who gave this word. Friends, I'm
[2:04:25] giving obedience. And I am not ashamed
[2:04:27] here to say I bow to that that uh
[2:04:30] prophetic word that came that could say
[2:04:34] stand up Mrs. Hoist
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; you're healed Mr. caught
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; that wisdom.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; That's the God
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; that this man serves.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; That God who's of the supernatural, that
[2:04:46] God that is of a of a divine power.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; That's the God that wrote this book.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; And that's what we serve.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; I bow to that. I give reverence to it.
[2:05:01] But Satan will want he wants to permeate
[2:05:05] in such a form till a person doesn't
[2:05:08] think that they are being forced to to
[2:05:12] bow. But there are so many demands and
[2:05:16] pressures that come upon us and we we we
[2:05:19] start
[2:05:21] first you just start caving into it you
[2:05:23] know and becoming weary with it and
[2:05:25] start just uh surrendering to it. I
[2:05:29] believe in this day and age, people have
[2:05:31] been preparing for all kinds of, you
[2:05:34] know, uh maybe uh tribulation or
[2:05:37] whatever more and storing up foods and
[2:05:39] all of this business. I don't think it's
[2:05:41] going to be that kind of thing at all. I
[2:05:43] think it's going to be a rip roaring
[2:05:45] global economy as it was in the days of
[2:05:48] Noah. They're going to buy and they're
[2:05:50] going to sell and they're going to build
[2:05:52] and they're going to plant and they're
[2:05:53] going to do all kinds of things. They're
[2:05:55] going to trade in huge economic blocks
[2:05:57] and the whole world and and as far as
[2:06:00] sexually is concerned, they're the whole
[2:06:02] world become polluted and contaminated
[2:06:04] and perverted.
[2:06:11] You know, they're making a great big
[2:06:12] thing.
[2:06:14] They arrested 17 terrorists
[2:06:18] in Toronto
[2:06:20] day before yesterday
[2:06:23] and they said that they got
[2:06:26] this this is the main this is the main
[2:06:28] news MSNBC news in the states that 17
[2:06:32] terrorists are arrested in Canada.
[2:06:37] They said they have three tons
[2:06:40] three tons
[2:06:43] of of
[2:06:45] explosives
[2:06:46] which just can be gotten almost
[2:06:48] anywhere. It's just farm
[2:06:52] uh fertilizer.
[2:06:56] One ton blew up the Oklahoma
[2:07:00] building.
[2:07:02] One ton. This is three tons.
[2:07:04] And there's been a little bit of word
[2:07:06] that maybe They were trying to actually
[2:07:10] blow up. They think they might going to
[2:07:11] be blow up. I think that tallest tower
[2:07:14] was until they got one taller in
[2:07:16] Malaysia, but the CN Tower in Toronto.
[2:07:19] They said if they did that, they would
[2:07:21] have blown away thousands of lives,
[2:07:24] several thousands of lives.
[2:07:27] So, they're making a big issue out of
[2:07:29] it.
[2:07:31] I sit there and listen and everybody
[2:07:32] just googling, you know. I was I I got
[2:07:36] it on my computer and I didn't think it
[2:07:38] would even be reported in the States
[2:07:40] because, you know, it's a strictly a
[2:07:42] Canadian thing, but there was some US
[2:07:44] connection. But while I'm sitting there
[2:07:46] and I have just read because I've been
[2:07:48] studying this message, I've just read,
[2:07:51] friends,
[2:07:52] that AIDS,
[2:07:56] there's 65 million
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; people in the earth with AIDS.
[2:08:02] 25 million have already died
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; and they're talking about 3,000 people
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; and they got the whole world all
[2:08:12] captivated. These guys got three tons
[2:08:14] of, you know, fertilizer and all the
[2:08:16] rest of it and they're going to blow up
[2:08:17] something. Sure, fine. That's tragic.
[2:08:20] What about this other thing?
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; And you have to search to find it.
[2:08:24] Right.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; And they get to some countries one in
[2:08:29] four and next country one in five. And
[2:08:32] it and it's just it it's and then they
[2:08:34] talk about
[2:08:35] we found a duck
[2:08:38] that's got the aven flu up in Mongolia.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; And we got they killed that duck.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; Come on folks.
[2:08:51] I'm not being I'm not mocking, but yet I
[2:08:54] am feeling a little bit like Elijah
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; serving all these gods.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; That's where your false gods have taken
[2:09:01] you. We're living in Sodom
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; and they're having their gay parade in
[2:09:06] in Israel.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Why don't they trace it down?
[2:09:18] because it's the spirit of the very god
[2:09:21] of this evil age and he's not going to
[2:09:24] attack that
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; and he's got the people all captivated
[2:09:28] on all these other things and all these
[2:09:30] other issues and making them so that he
[2:09:33] himself
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; remains remains secluded. He remains
[2:09:38] guarded from it and we're in contact
[2:09:40] with it every day
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; and would impose that upon you. I know
[2:09:47] you're a little bit quiet, but that's
[2:09:48] the world that you live in. But you are
[2:09:51] not of this world. I will repeat the
[2:09:54] words of Jesus. You're not of this
[2:09:57] world.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; You're in the world, but you're not of
[2:10:01] the world. These things are of the
[2:10:03] world, but we're not of the world. And I
[2:10:06] I want to thank God only by his grace
[2:10:09] that we're not of the world, but we're
[2:10:12] in the world.
[2:10:13] We're we're you know we're talking about
[2:10:15] they're talking about pandemics
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; and and and inoculating everybody. I
[2:10:21] tell you what, friends.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; I may go off the same but you mark my
[2:10:27] word. There's no solution.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; There's no solution
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; for the corruption
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; that has been that has been in initiated
[2:10:38] in this age because that's the way it's
[2:10:40] going to go. Amen.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; And you want to thank God, you've got an
[2:10:44] exit out of here.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; You got a way out of here.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Let it sink in
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; and say, "I thank God I'm not part of
[2:10:54] it."
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; you're the one,
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; the glorious one that has made a way of
[2:11:05] escape for your people. And today Lord I
[2:11:08] am rejoicing and bringing across to
[2:11:11] these people the words that you spoke
[2:11:13] Lord Jesus and telling your disciples in
[2:11:17] that great prayer uh in John 17 that
[2:11:21] they were in the world but they are not
[2:11:24] of the world. We have not come as being
[2:11:28] part of the world but Lord Jesus we are
[2:11:31] separated from it. And I pray that the
[2:11:34] Holy Spirit with just a divine
[2:11:37] inspiration will permeate every person.
[2:11:40] There are those here perhaps need to be
[2:11:42] filled with the Holy Ghost. Lord, we
[2:11:44] need that kind of wisdom. We need that
[2:11:47] kind of discernment. And I pray that you
[2:11:49] will grant it. Lord, in the name of
[2:11:51] Jesus Christ, take these words. I pray
[2:11:54] that you will instill it deep in the
[2:11:56] hearts of the people. And Lord, I pray
[2:11:59] that that they will never be ashamed of
[2:12:01] your word. We're going to stand by it.
[2:12:04] But Lord, with Jesus, we want to express
[2:12:06] it. We want to live it out. And I pray,
[2:12:08] Father, that the word will be indelibly
[2:12:11] marked in the hearts of the people. And
[2:12:13] that you'll take the service tonight, oh
[2:12:15] God, and bless the people as they come
[2:12:18] from service to service. And as we move
[2:12:20] onward and upward in the name of Jesus
[2:12:23] Christ, I ask it. Amen. Amen.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; While I was studying, guess getting
[2:12:28] ready to come to the pulpit, you can you
[2:12:30] can well imagine I just thought, "Thank
[2:12:33] God, this world's not my home.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; I'm just
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; passing through.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; My treasures are laid up
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; somewhere beyond the blue." See, you
[2:12:47] know, we sit here in the congregation.
[2:12:50] Are we getting ready to sing that,
[2:12:51] please? We sit here in the congregation
[2:12:54] and I don't know if you realize it but
[2:12:56] you're protected people.
[2:12:59] Those that have to get out and I travel
[2:13:02] to a lot of countries
[2:13:04] and what I'm speaking about I've been in
[2:13:07] contact with.
[2:13:09] I've been I've been in countries that
[2:13:12] have been incredibly plagued.
[2:13:15] Used to be plagued by poverty
[2:13:18] and that is sad in itself. but plagued
[2:13:23] with the sin that the world is sinking
[2:13:27] in.
[2:13:30] If it weren't for the promise of God,
[2:13:31] friend, I don't even know where I would
[2:13:33] be.
[2:13:35] Knowing what we know and the reality of
[2:13:38] it, all I can say, I thank God more
[2:13:41] today for Calvary
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; and for the power of the blood of Jesus
[2:13:45] Christ, for the protection of it. You've
[2:13:49] been a protected people.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; You want to rejoice over it.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we stand?
[2:14:00] This world is not my home. I'm just a
[2:14:05] passing through. My treasures are made
[2:14:09] up somewhere beyond the moon.
[2:14:14] Angel
[2:14:15] [Music]
[2:14:17] heaven's open door and I can't feel at
[2:14:21] all in this world anymore.
[2:14:29] I have no friend like you. And if
[2:14:32] heaven's not my home, then Lord, what
[2:14:36] would I do? The angels back at me from
[2:14:42] heaven's open door. And I can't feel at
[2:14:46] home in this world anymore.
[2:14:50] They're all expecting me. And that's one
[2:14:54] thing I know. I fixed it up with Jesus
[2:15:00] many years ago.
[2:15:02] [Music]
[2:15:06] Though I am weak and poor and I can't
[2:15:10] feel at all in this world anymore.
[2:15:15] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[2:15:20] you. And if heaven's not my home, then
[2:15:24] Lord, what would I do? The angels
[2:15:28] fashion me from heaven's open door. And
[2:15:33] I can't feel at home in this world
[2:15:37] anymore.
[2:15:39] Just over in the glory land. We'll live
[2:15:43] eternally.
[2:15:44] [Music]
[2:15:47] Yeah.
[2:15:49] Sh.
[2:15:51] [Music]
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord,
[2:16:06] you know I have no friend like you. And
[2:16:10] if heaven's not my home, then Lord, what
[2:16:14] would I do? The angels fashion me from
[2:16:19] heaven's open door and I can't feel at
[2:16:23] home in this world anymore.
[2:16:28] We're only we're only going to walk
[2:16:30] through here once. You won't live
[2:16:32] yesterday again.
[2:16:35] This day has gone thus far.
[2:16:40] as your brother, as your friend, as your
[2:16:42] pastor,
[2:16:44] I want to re-emphasize and say, live
[2:16:47] every day for him.
[2:16:50] You will never regret it.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; And when we reach the other shore,
[2:16:55] we're going to shake hands.
[2:16:58] We're going to embrace one another
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; literally.
[2:17:03] You'll have a body. You have it now.
[2:17:06] You've never seen it, but looks like you
[2:17:11] in your perfect health and life stream.
[2:17:16] And you have it and God
[2:17:19] designed it.
[2:17:21] You're going to live in it
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; like you're living in this one.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; But we only have this moment to go
[2:17:27] through.
[2:17:29] For some of us might be long life. Some
[2:17:31] of us might be shorter life.
[2:17:34] Live it, my brother, my sister, with all
[2:17:37] the fervor and all the zeal
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; that you can.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; Don't let the enemy wear you down. As a
[2:17:45] prophet would say so often, don't be
[2:17:47] weary.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Don't be weary.
[2:17:52] Live it with everything that you have.
[2:17:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; You even if you'll just say, "Lord, let
[2:18:00] the let the very
[2:18:02] fervor or the burden of your word that
[2:18:06] my brother Ed is feeling right now, let
[2:18:09] it come into me
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; and let it possess me.
[2:18:15] Let it permeate me."
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; Because I'm praying for that. I'm
[2:18:19] praying that every man and woman and
[2:18:21] every young person here become an
[2:18:23] absolute fire brand for God in whatever
[2:18:26] area you are in. You're going to touch
[2:18:28] somebody that I can't touch. You're
[2:18:30] going to influence them. They're not
[2:18:31] going to be in the church. They're going
[2:18:32] to hear your life preaching. May your
[2:18:35] life preach a mighty sermon is my
[2:18:37] prayer. Amen.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'd like to sing. Linda then
[2:18:42] sings my soul, my savior God to thee.
[2:18:46] The the chorus, please. Then sings, "My
[2:18:50] soul,

[2:20:26] [Music]
[2:20:31] We glorify you, Lord.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; With those words on your lips, we
[2:20:38] dismiss you in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:20:41] with the blessings of God.
[2:20:44] May you go from this place as sons and
[2:20:48] daughters that have come from another
[2:20:51] land and are on their way back to that
[2:20:54] land.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; We're just journeying here for a short
[2:20:58] moment.
[2:21:02] And we have others who've already
[2:21:05] crossed over.
[2:21:08] We're going to meet them. This isn't a
[2:21:11] fairy tale. It's not something we just
[2:21:13] have to keep thinking about. It is the
[2:21:15] reality. That's the real place
[2:21:19] and that's where we're going. And that's
[2:21:21] why you were here this morning is to get
[2:21:23] ready for it. Greet one another. Would
[2:21:26] you
[2:21:28] God bless you? You're dismissed in Jesus
[2:21:30] name.
