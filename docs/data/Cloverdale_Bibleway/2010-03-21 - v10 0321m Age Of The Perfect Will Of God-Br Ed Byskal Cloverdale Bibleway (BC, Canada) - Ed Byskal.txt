And it's so good to see you this morning. It's so good to see him live through you. I want to sing I want to be holy righteous number 1060 on the screen. Maybe just before we sing that, I'll give a couple of quick announcements. We don't have to interrupt the rest of the service at this point. Um if you had any lost in items from camp, they can be found in the fellowship room. They can be picked up uh between now and April 4th. After that, they'll be sent away to a needy country, I'm sure. Young people's choir is this afternoon at 3:30. So, if you're in Young People's Choir, make sure that you're here for that. And the nursery, for those of you that are moms that have little babies, the nursery is under renovation at this point, but they have the fellowship room set up for all the mothers that would need a nursery to be able to use that. So, dads, brothers, young people, make sure you stay out of the fellowship room as the moms will be using that as a nursery. For today, we have a new addition to the family of God, Caitlyn. An where's mom and dad Paula? Not here yet. This morning, all right. Well, it's awful new baby. So, she's born 7 lb 3 oz. Little baby girl. So, we want to congratulate brother Steve and sister Paula.

So, if you see them, make sure you make them real welcome into the house of the Lord this morning. Where's Brother Matthew Dertie? How's that rib, brother Matthew? Perfect. Nobody noticed. Brother Matthew had a broken rib on Wednesday. He was standing in the parking lot. Had a couple of brothers lay hands on him and pray for him. I think he actually wrote who they were here. Brother Ben Drake, Brother Jim Miller, and the Lord miraculously touched him &gt;&gt; and healed his rib. Matthew wants to give praise to the Lord this morning. Amen.

Brother John Kerr, why don't you come and just lead us in prayer this morning, each one that has a need upon your heart, just lift it before the Lord as we pray. Those that are visiting amongst us, we trust that the Holy Spirit will minister to you this morning. Those that are on the internet, hook up, reach out and touch the master this morning. We have loved ones. We have unsaved ones. We have those that are far from God. We have those that are streaming that feel just as much a part of this service as you do, the redeemed of the Lord, sitting here this morning. And they need us to pull on the word because they're pulling on the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to hear what the Lord has to say to the church this morning.

I wonder if we could stand once again. [Music] As humans, we always are needy and we need the supernatural &gt;&gt; amongst us. &gt;&gt; We have I have I have Sister Elizabeth Das. I have you on my heart today. She's here. Perhaps a lot of people may have stayed home, but she's got severe pain, knees swelling. They say it's arthritis. We have a God that's greater than arthritis. &gt;&gt; So, I just pray that God will dispense with the arthritis &gt;&gt; in his presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; And sister Sue Aguary, I just heard of Brother Phil's need and terrible condition with I've never even heard of it with shingles behind the eye. And shingles are very, very painful. Sister Sue, go and tell Phil Forest, would you please? God is greater than the shingles and your congregation of people. And when the prophet said that people are raising their hand and coming to God in unison and unity and if one chase a thousand and two 10,000 what about a congregation like this? Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; He's greater than all of these things. Greater than cancer, greater than diabetes, greater than all of these things. and we bring your affliction, whether it be physical or spiritual or any other emotional, we bring it to him. And I know we've already prayed, but I'd just like to have you join with me in prayer before we come to the word. Oh, Father Jehovah Gyra, &gt;&gt; the provider, our provider. You've provided all that we have need of and more. You're the creator of heavens and earth and you've made all things. And we're praying, oh God, for our brother Philari today, Lord. And my heart was so touched as I heard yesterday of his affliction. Smite this affliction, oh God. And may it begin to subside as of now, oh God. And may he be delivered from this affliction. Our sister Elizabeth Diaz is here. Oh God, remove, I pray, oh Father, this arthritic condition and swelling of the knees and may she walk for the glory of God and many other needs that are amongst us. Lord, our brother Daryl, oh God, how we're standing firm with him. You spoke to him and touched him. Lord, you've touched me. Father, you've touched brother John Lei. Oh God, you've touched so many that are here. We give you glory. We give you praise. You're the almighty one, the God of Abraham, of God of Isaac, and God of Jacob. You're the God of the living and not of the dead. We give you praise, Lord. We give you praise. And all out on the internet congregation, oh God. Let them stand in their rooms and wherever they are. And may they be delivered and healed, Father, by the power of the resurrected Christ. For you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. You're the mighty I am. Not I was or will be, but you are today, Lord. We thank you. We thank you. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. And now touch us as we turn to your word. Father, give us a spirit of revelation upon us, Lord. Spirit of adoption, oh God. Bring us into a maturity Lord where we will have understanding in your word I pray and take it to heart in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; In Jesus name. In Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I wonder if we could maybe just sing thank you Jesus. Thank you [Music] Jesus. [Music] for the things that you have done for us. Oh, I can love that you have given me life. Thank you, Lord. Thank you. Thank you, Jesus. Jesus [Music] for the things that you have done for us. Oh, I can't repain the love that you have given me. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you'd like to join with me in reading and turn to the scripture in second Peter the 3 chapter. And while you're turning, we want to say the baptism we're going to have tonight. Our young sister Brooke Bismouth is going to be baptized. And I don't know who else might want to be baptized if they've never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and baptized into this word. That's the baptism that we believe in and do. So thankful for the young men, young women, young people and the meetings and the after effect of the camp meetings. Remember when you have a meeting with God, it doesn't end with camp. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't end with a good service. You just keep pressing on. &gt;&gt; Good to hear you pray, John. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother John has been here since been a young boy. It's wonderful to see the different ones have prayed. I was so moved as I heard, you know, the different ones pray and and lead in part. It's your it's your turn now. We want to greet those on the streaming congregation. We have a nice congregation here, but there's many more and uh uh possibly hundreds of people that are streaming. And we want to say God bless you. Uh once in a while, just occasionally I look to see where they're streaming from. Generally about 25 countries and perhaps even more I think of and I look at them every once in a while. I see them throughout the uh Europe nations, United Kingdom and and France and Belgium and Holland and Norway and into Russia and the Ukraine and Poland down through many nations in Africa. And they're here with us. They're streaming and we say God bless you &gt;&gt; down into New Zealand and Singapore, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, uh, Brazil, uh, Mexico. My, there are just so many down on the islands of the sea. So, we just say God bless them &gt;&gt; immensely and I trust that they will have a a wonderful, joyous time with the word today. You've been enjoying the future home. That's good. You're not enjoying it near as much as you're going to when you get there. &gt;&gt; We'll start to read second Peter the 3 chapter starting at the first verse. This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance, that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior. Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying, "Where is the promise of his coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. For this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished. But the heavens and the earth, which are now by the same word, are kept in store, reserved under fire, against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men. But beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness, but is long-suffering to usward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved. What manner what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hastening unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved. Any element shall melt with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. And we say amen. God bless you as you have your seats. Just as a little prelude to the message, I want to say to you as a as a congregation, as a pastor, as a friend, as a brother in Christ, we are taught and we believe that God has sent uh his prophet and messenger. I want to think of that word for a moment. his messenger with remarkable vindication because the message was critical and urgent and important. I would like to say that the message we refer to the message so many times but I want to emphasize and impress you deeply today that brother Brandham was sent and a messenger means to give an announcement or it is actually a one sent forth with orders. He wasn't here for his own choosing. He was here with orders. He was sent with orders. &gt;&gt; And you and I are privileged to hear those orders. &gt;&gt; So this is not a you know just a hoham church or doctrine. Right. &gt;&gt; This is uh one that has been that has been received by a messenger, an announcing messenger. Here are some of the announcements. This is the last age. &gt;&gt; This is the last church age &gt;&gt; and the messenger always comes at the end of the age. This is the messenger &gt;&gt; because he's been proven by a multitude of vindications. &gt;&gt; This is the calling out of the bride. &gt;&gt; It's not something happened hundreds of years ago. It's happening now. &gt;&gt; And we have received the last signs. Think of it. We have received the sign of the Messiah. Yes. &gt;&gt; We have received the sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Just think of it. We talk about a resurrection, but we have seen the sign of the resurrection. It's on tape. You can hear it. And when you hear that vindication, you say, "I'm hearing the sign of the resurrection." &gt;&gt; This messenger has said that the bride will be the final age, the final voice to the final age. And if you are a bride and you believe that, then you have to declare and confess God has sent the most vindicated, proven messenger to tell me and announce to me that this is the final voice and I'm a part of that final voice to the final age. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's only right that this kind of messenger would be the one who would tell us about the future home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just the future home, but the future home of the heavenly bridegroom &gt;&gt; and the earthly bride. &gt;&gt; Our eternal home. This messenger has been sent to tell us of these things in the message of future home and many of you have been reading it and I'm so thankful for that. There are there are three things that I would like to draw your attention to and and and brother Brown speaks of all three of them but I would like to stitch them together. Excuse me. He speaks of three stages of the earth. I'm not preaching yet. We're just starting to set a little base foundation. Three stages of the earth. But the last stage he he speaks clearly that it that that speaks of eternity. &gt;&gt; Not the millennium, but eternity. Then he speaks of then he breaks off from that and goes into the Old Testament to Leviticus the 23rd chapter. And those you had been reading it will recall now these are things you've read. And he goes into the Old Testament goes to the 23rd chapter of Leviticus which speaks of the seven feasts. The seven feasts and he goes to the last feast. Said now this is the feast of tabernacles which is a dwelling places. It speaks of the changing of the body. And he goes to that. But he says now the last day of that feast was the eighth day and there is no eighth day. There's only seven because the eighth day speaks of eternity. &gt;&gt; So when he speaks of the world, he takes it to eternity. When he starts now to speak of the last feast, he takes it and shows from the Old Testament, it blends right into eternity. And then he takes and speaks also of the wave sheath which happened after Jesus was resurrected from the dead. And he said he was waved over the people because he was the first one that come to full maturity. And he was waved over the people as a memorial to God that there's more like him in the field. &gt;&gt; And you were in the field. You were laying in the field of the earth when Jesus Christ was waved over the people. And the Bible says the prophet brings out from the scripture that he was he he was it was waved as a memorial that there were more like him in the field and that they would come. There were more like him that would come forth. And I want to say to you now before we start preaching and here we are. Right? &gt;&gt; It's this God who brought us forth &gt;&gt; and he sent Elijah with all the vindication and all the proof and something that would speak to that seed that you have in you because that also was eternal life seed and that's the only thing that could quicken it was was the spirit of God. Isn't it wonderful? Amen. &gt;&gt; And we we took and started last Wednesday. Thy our heaven our heavenly father, thy kingdom come, thy will be done. Our father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. What I've just spoken to you now is the consummation of his will. Thy will be done. Thy desire. What he desires is not that we're sitting here fighting with the world. That he's allowed that, but his desire is that he'll take his children to his home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come. &gt;&gt; Thy will be done. This is his will. His will is his desires, his ambitions, his his objective. What he takes pleasure in. He doesn't take pleasure even in the death of the wicked. He doesn't take pleasure in all the wars and the fighting and all the things that we even uh we have we scrape with every day. We rub rub shoulders with every day and we're bombarded with every day. He doesn't take pleasure in that. He takes pleasure that he's delivered us from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that will be the age of the perfect will of God. What I'm speaking of now is the age of the perfect will of God. So now it's it is absolutely so important. I I I even fail to find words to express how important it is that we discern the hour that we're living in and who we are. &gt;&gt; That God has called you for this time and for this season. And as Jesus said to Jerusalem, if thou hast known even thou, at least in this thy day, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace, but now they are hid from thy eyes. And then he goes on as for the days. Notice he said if you had known this day, but he said the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee about and keep thee on every side and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee. And they shall not leave uh in thee one stone upon another because thou kneest not the time of thy visitation. We this this uh generation this age has had a time of most unusual vindication and visitation. &gt;&gt; This is our day &gt;&gt; when God has visited us. &gt;&gt; And even as Tommy Osbborne said of brother Brennham's uh memorial, he said, "I know I'll be misunderstood for this, but he said God walked amongst us again." &gt;&gt; And he says, and mark my word, this won't happen again. I tell you what, I don't know what what other things he has preached. I've heard many things. Uh I've heard a number of sermons of brother Osborne when he was uh ministering and brother Brown spoke highly of him. But I can tell you he was ordained of God to say those things. &gt;&gt; God walked amongst us &gt;&gt; and he will not do it again because it needed to have that kind of significance so that we would realize the hour that we're in. And as I said earlier on Wednesday that they Jesus said the children of the world are wiser in their generation in their time. They pick up on things quick real quickly. We find our children and and the educational world and they pick up on things real quick and and they they major on it and they build on it and they advance and they go further with it. And uh we don't want to we don't want to be that way spiritually. Um, I mean, we don't want to be slack spiritually. We want to in the message countdown, my there's so many things going through my mind, you'll have to just try to stay with me. But in the message countdown, Brother Brandham takes the advancement of the world and shows that the church has advanced right along with it. But we don't want to be slack in the in the advancement of the church and the advancement of what's happened. Look, look at what God has sent. And yet, there's so many multitudes that they don't only deny it. They don't want to have anything to do with it. &gt;&gt; To them, it seems like it's old-fashioned. And it's so advanced, they can't even grasp it. &gt;&gt; I can tell you, Brother Brandham spoke things that were so advanced in science, in in medicine, in uh botney life, in all fields of science. He's so advanced. [Music] &gt;&gt; How would you like many, many years ago saying, "There's voices going through here right now. There's colors going through this room right now. There's bodies going through this room. That's right. &gt;&gt; Figure that one out. &gt;&gt; That's not not some strange off-the-wall doctrine. That's exactly true. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Science could prove it." And so you have a radio, you have a signal, you have a television, it proves some of these things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So the messenger to the people of this day, one sent with orders in the message Elisha the prophet. I I I just want to I want to identify some things in these quotes. It might be quite long, but hang on to the essence of the quote because I'm on a very specific theme. Brother Brandham, now I'm on a on this theme of knowing the time that you're in. He knew the time. He had to know the time that he was in. &gt;&gt; All right? And in Brother Brandham's ministry, you'll find that um uh you'll find that his ministry was such it was progressive. The revelation was progressive. And uh and so the unveiling to us is progressive. He says, "Now down through the age, now this is this is 1956 down through the age." He said, "You come." He's speaking now in prayer. You come and vindicated yourself. How we can see David climbing the mountain and looking back over Jerusalem and rejected by his own. And he wept as he went up the mount. And just a few hundred years after that, we see the son of David rejected and sitting on the same mountain saying, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how oft you and hovered over you as a hen with her chicks, but you would not if you'd only known your day of visitation." And he says, "And dear father tonight," now this 1956, "and dear father, tonight my heart I feel the Holy Spirit crying out, oh now there's a messenger announcing, oh America, America, how oft would the Holy Spirit have given you the real outpouring of a revival? how he would have gathered you and held you in safety. But I believe you didn't understand the day of your visitation. You scorned the prophets. You called them fanatics and you put them in jail. &gt;&gt; Then in 1961 in sers we would see Jesus. He said, "I'm praying, fasting, and waiting on God. I want to do my part while I'm here in California. You do your part. God is doing greater things today than he ever than ever has been known since Jesus Christ was on earth. And it's going right over the top of the people's head. What's he saying? They still don't understand the day of their visitation. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And they're missing it." He said, "That's the bad part. if they'd only known it like Jesus. If you'd known your day, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often I would have hovered over you as a hen does her brood. But you would not if you would have only known your day of visitation. He said, "That's the way it is today. It's always been and that's the way that's what it is now. if we' if we'd have only known the day of visitation. But the visitation goes right through and the people are looking way over here for something else and the first thing you know the visitation's over and there it is. That's why I'm rejoicing so much tonight that we have caught the voice of the visitation. We've caught and heard the voice of the announcement. Our hearts are moved. Our whole soul is stirred because it's not just a service for us. It's not just a church for us. We've heard it and we've received it as a messenger from God with an announcement that this is this is what's happening. And we're saying, "Oh God, cause me to be alert. &gt;&gt; Oh God, let me be fully at attention. Let me be ready to receive this as a voice from God." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the choosing of the bride. Now we go to 1965. I'm just moving you &gt;&gt; through the prophet's ministry because this is what this is. That's why I I came at first to say he came with an announcement. &gt;&gt; These people missed it. 56 missed it. &gt;&gt; 61 missed it. 63 65 missed it. &gt;&gt; Let's not us miss it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Men were soon going into future home. He said that solemn that's solemn warning cuz he had just spoken some comments and I always read before it. He said, "We don't know what time." Notice that the time we don't know what time and you don't know what time that the city one day is going to be laying out here in the bottom of this ocean. &gt;&gt; This is an announcement. It's not just something that you know he spilled out of his lips. This is an announcement. This city will be laying out here at the bottom of this ocean. Oh, Capernium. He said Jesus said Jesus, thou exalted into heaven will be brought down into hell. For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom and Gomorrah, it would have been standing till this day. And Sodom and Gomorrah lays at the bottom of the Dead Sea. And Capernaum's at the bottom of the sea. And thou city who claims to be the city of angels, uh, Los Angeles, he said, you exalted yourself into heaven, they got their stars, their fallen stars, wicked stars. and you that have exalted yourself into the heavens and have have and and and and have sent your filth, he said, you've picked up your filth and sent it away with your fine churches and your staples. You're still religious, you see, and so forth the way you do. Remember, one day you'll be laying at the bottom of the sea. You great honeycomb under you. Your great honeycomb under you right now. The wrath of God is belching right beneath you. How much longer he'll hold this sandbar hanging over that when that ocean out yonder a mile deep will slide in there plum back to the salt and sea. It'll be worse than the days of Pompei. Repent. Los Angeles. Repent. The rest of you and turn to God. The hour of his wrath is upon the earth. flee while there's time to flee and come into Christ. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be around when that happens. &gt;&gt; I can just tell you right now, they the world think they had a meltdown. They have no meltdown like it's coming. &gt;&gt; And I want to be in Christ. &gt;&gt; I want to be fully in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Mori said to Esther, "For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time," &gt;&gt; that's her time. &gt;&gt; Then shall there be an enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place. &gt;&gt; I would say to the bride from another place, &gt;&gt; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed. And who knoweth, who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this? &gt;&gt; I say to you young people, I say to this congregation, I say to those that are streaming, who knoweth? &gt;&gt; God knows that we have come to the kingdom for such a time as this. And that's why God sends this kind of a messenger, sends this kind of a prophet, sends this kind of vindication. That's why he himself came and stood at the pull pit at the platform service after service whether it be uh Durban, South Africa or Bombay or Houston, Texas or Dawson Creek or Edmonton or Saskatoon or Chicago or wherever it was that was that pillar fire came there so that we wouldn't miss it. &gt;&gt; So that we wouldn't miss the day of visitation. That's why it all happened. That's why that's why men come like brother Diggs. That's why men come and that as brother Tom will preach tonight, brother John taking services as myself, other men of God who are ministering to the bride of Jesus Christ with such an urgency. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some may minister for different reasons, but I'm not here for another reason. I'm here to expend all the energy and all the vision and burden that I have for you that are here, dear loved ones and friends. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've been called for such a time as this. He says of the church, the church and recognize the day in his message. The church has not recognized her day. Recognize the day of the evening time. It's here. It's not coming. The evening time is here. And it's here to vindicate the coming of Christ. And we're at the end. Recognize your day. &gt;&gt; One of the most significant times in all of history when one span of time blended into another. &gt;&gt; He talks about the church ages. One blends into the other. And once again, a messenger is sent at a specific time. And brother Brandham was sent here at this time when time would blend into eternity. And that's why he had to go into this message. He never spoke future home a dozen times. As far as I know, he spoke it once. And he takes you into the three stages of the earth going into eternity. He takes you into the eighth day taking you into eternity. He takes us into the wave sheath which takes right into eternity. That is the whole theme of that message. I I need I need to set this before you as we move on into it. But now just quickly, there's been some fullnesses of times when something when something comes to its fullness and then and then it's as Jesus said your day, oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, if you'd only known your day of visitation. But now it's gone. &gt;&gt; Now something else is going to happen. An era has passed. Hear the word of God. I came and walked among you. God in flesh, the fullness of the Godhead. I walked among you, did all manner of healings, sent the word and and healed the people and did all manner of miracles, but now it's gone. In other words, like Tommy Osborne said, you're not going to see this again. &gt;&gt; You're not going to see it like this. But now this era has passed. &gt;&gt; And uh Jerusalem and the temple will be laying down. There won't be one stone upon another. another era is going to come. &gt;&gt; He said in the a scripture which he read, "Blessed is he that readeth, Revelation 1 and3, and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep the sayings which are written therein." Four. And the reason for blessed are they is because the time is at hand. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham takes that phrase, the time is at hand. In Revelation, the Revelation series uh church age book chapter 1 says the time was not at hand previously. &gt;&gt; The time wasn't at hand previously. The warning for Los Angeles wasn't needed previously. He was sent with that warning. He was sent with that declaration. The time was not at hand previously. In the wisdom and economy of God, this mighty revelation could not come forth hitherto. This revelation couldn't come previously. He says, "Thus we immediately learn a principle. The revelation of God for each age can come can each age can come in that age only and at that specific time." What you're hearing today couldn't even have come to the previous generation. It had to come at your time. &gt;&gt; And you young people will hear at it perhaps hear it. You hear the same words and you'll hear it at a different level than perhaps someone else because you will be energized and inspired and revelated and say, "This is my time. &gt;&gt; I'm here. &gt;&gt; I'm breathing. I've been given life. Doesn't matter how you came down physically. It matters what you heard spiritually. &gt;&gt; God ordained that I would hear this. God ordained that I would be in a certain camp, hear a certain messenger, sit in a certain church, hear a certain thing. God ordained this is my time. &gt;&gt; Says the revelation of God to Moses came only at a specific time in history. And even more specifically, it came as the people cried unto God. &gt;&gt; Jesus himself came at the fullness of time. Fullness of time. Please hang on to that. He being the complete revelation of the Godhead. And in this age, Leodysian, the revelation of God will come in its due time. &gt;&gt; It will not falter. Neither will it be premature. Think on this and heed it well. For we are in the end time today. &gt;&gt; Oh, let us be moved. &gt;&gt; Let our hearts be opened. &gt;&gt; And say, "Oh, God, don't let me miss a thing. &gt;&gt; Let me get every tidbit. Let me get every part. &gt;&gt; This is the time. This is my time. That's why I'm here." &gt;&gt; I'd say, "If it's not your time, why weren't you born previously? here. Why weren't you born sometime in the future? You were born now. You were brought here now for this season, for this time. &gt;&gt; We're not here just to be a carpenter or a a plumber or electrician or or or something else or a housewife or even though that's our ministry. We have to do those things. That's part of this life. But your real call, your real call was to hear this word. Your real call was to hear this messenger. God sent you. And so the you you the real prayer is, "Oh God, thank you for your voice. I've heard it. &gt;&gt; I heeded it. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; It will not falter. &gt;&gt; And it will not be premature." &gt;&gt; So then that time came at the time of Jesus. Jesus came at the fullness of time. And then the fullness came the fullness of the of the Old Testament. And the Bible says, "And when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his son." when the fullness of time when God was done with the law and because that could never bring man to righteousness even the prophets everything that they they kept trying to turn the people back back to the law to the keeping of the things and it could not bring a people to perfection it couldn't bring them to a wave sheath &gt;&gt; that isn't what God desired all burning of animals and sacrifices and he even said one place all your new moons and your sacrifices is a stench in my nostrils. That is what he wanted. Integrity of the heart. &gt;&gt; But there was no transforming power in the blood of bulls and goats. But there's transforming power in the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Be ye therefore transformed. And when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth a son made of a woman and made under the law. And that that's why Jesus said, "Think not that I've come to destroy the law and the prophets. I've come think not that I come to destroy the law or the prophets. I'm not come to destroy, but to fulfill." In other words, I've come to bring it to its final conclusion. I've come to bring it to its fullness. I'm the end of it. &gt;&gt; Not that God cast it off and said, "Well, that was a big mistake." No. Then Jesus came at the end of it and says, "I'm part of the fulfillment. &gt;&gt; I've brought it to its conclusion. I've brought it. The will of God concerning the law and the prophets has now been completed. I'm a part of that completion. Are you with me?" &gt;&gt; And that after Jesus short time to fulfill it is to bring it to the full measure. Jesus was the full measure &gt;&gt; of the whole Old Testament and the law &gt;&gt; to render it perfect to bring it to pass. So Jesus came to fulfill or bring the final conclusion of the Old Testament law and prophets. Thus when he the lamb of God died at the time of the feast of the Passover all other lambs died in vain. Jesus lived for 33 and a2 years. But during those years, they kept the Passover every year. And every year, God honored their Passover. They all killed their lambs. And God honored their lambs. But when the fullness came and God's lamb was hanging on Calvary that day, they killed all their lambs in vain. [Applause] You see friends, &gt;&gt; that is why when God's prophet messenger came and after he delivered his message, it was fine for us to come and we gather in churches and we sing songs of worship. But when finally the message came, which was Christ himself and the people turned that down, all of their singing, all of their worship, all that became empty. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because an era had passed. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So they sang in vain. They practiced in vain. They prayed in vain. They worshiped in vain because it was man's doing and not God's doing. &gt;&gt; God was here. God stood on the platform. The pillar of fire was on the platform. God witnessed it. And they rejected it and turned it down. and religion became an empty and that is why Hollywood has moved to the platform. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm glad we still have the Holy Ghost on the platform. I'm glad we still have the pillar of fire at the platform. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Unfolding the word speaking to the people [Applause] &gt;&gt; in the power of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God come amongst us. &gt;&gt; Do whatever is necessary here. &gt;&gt; So the fullness of time had come. &gt;&gt; And Jesus came to bring this fulfillment. &gt;&gt; And he says the law and the prophets were until John &gt;&gt; were until John. &gt;&gt; And since that time &gt;&gt; the kingdom of God is preached. It's a different era, &gt;&gt; a different time. So the law and the prophets where until John, until that time, but now the kingdom of God is preached, something else is happening. And that's why Jesus could say, "I didn't come to destroy it. I'm putting all of these together. I came to fulfill it." &gt;&gt; And so he began to turn. He began to announce. Even John the Baptist began to announce that another era is coming. The lamb of God is here. I'm going to introduce him. I don't know who he is, but I'm going to introduce him. What a revelation when he saw his own cousin after the flesh walking in the mud of uh of Jordan River and saying, "This is him of whom I spake." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He knew no man after the flesh. &gt;&gt; He only knew him after the spirit and the word of God. This is him. Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. &gt;&gt; Jesus began to turn the corner &gt;&gt; from law to grace. &gt;&gt; And that is why then the apostle Paul came and it was it was important. It was absolutely essential that he would meet the pillar of fire not in the flesh. He didn't know Jesus after the flesh. He met him on the road to to Damascus and he and the apostle and brother Brandham says he knew that presence. He knew that was the same one that was in the burning bush back there. He said and that's why he could turn the corner from lot of grace. He had to have that kind of an encounter. Listen my brother, my sister, the Holy Spirit, the prophet of God, the prophet of God had the pillar of fire in attendance and saw it over the people and revealed the secret of the people's hearts. Are you ready? While that pillar of fire hung over him and while that pillar of fire hung over the room where he where the seals were opened, you are the product &gt;&gt; of what he spoke &gt;&gt; under the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, that that does so much for me. We're here. We're here as a product. You're a product of the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; You're not the product of this church. You're not the product of some man's ministry. You're the product of the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's it for the Lord. &gt;&gt; In the message, evening messenger, he said, "It's always been a fight &gt;&gt; for the messenger &gt;&gt; to separate the old from the new." &gt;&gt; It's always been a fight for the messenger coming to separate the old from new. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Though always the message must be scriptural, now for each foretold of the other." For instance, he said Jesus how hard it was him to come in and change the message from law to grace. Yet the Bible said it would come that way and there'd come a Messiah and the daily sacrifice would be done &gt;&gt; would be over. So that was Jesus part &gt;&gt; of turning it from law to grace &gt;&gt; and then apostle Paul he came the sacrifice of Jesus Christ was the full end and the completion of the prophecy this prophecy and the woman's seed shall bruise the serpent's headl &gt;&gt; that had to And he was the fullness of that prophecy. No one had to come and doctor it up. No one had to come and add to it. The serpent's head was crushed at Calvary. &gt;&gt; We must never forget that. &gt;&gt; And that is why in the Patmas vision, Jesus could say, "I am the first and the last. I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold, I'm alive forever more." &gt;&gt; What is there to fear? The judgment that fell upon him at the cross, at the grave, and when he descended was for us. &gt;&gt; He absorbed. He absorbed. Are you listening? He absorbed the full brunt of the wound of sin. And there therefore is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Here is the one who conquered both worlds, the seen and the unseen. &gt;&gt; Here he is. &gt;&gt; Not back there. He's here. He conquered both worlds. He conquered the world that you tend you have to live in and tend with and he conquered the world that is to come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because Satan wants to keep us out of there. He's not going to be able to do it. &gt;&gt; The atmosphere in the in the future home, the atmosphere is filled with demon spirits. They come to afflict you. That's the unseen world. This Jesus that has spoken to you, that called you, has defeated that that atmosphere. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He alone is the savior, redeemer. He is the only God. The Lord Jesus Christ is his name. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul was chosen by God. never got to walk with the Lord Jesus Christ. But he was the one chosen to separate the law from grace. And the prophet said in Christ the mystery, God revealed Paul had something greater than any of the apostles did because Paul saw him &gt;&gt; after he was dead, &gt;&gt; buried, and rose again and expressed himself in the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel. That led the children of Israel. No wonder that he could separate the law from grace. Over in the book of Hebrews, he meant the same pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; And then there's another fullness, the fullness of the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; And here you are. &gt;&gt; Here we are. Amen. &gt;&gt; The fullness of times when that will take place and the Bible says the fullness of the Gentiles when the fullness of the Gentiles arrived and the fullness of times it's referred to both ways. God sent his last messenger not John the Baptist but the same spirit of Elijah. When the fullness of times of the Old Testament came, God sent Elijah the third time of his coming. When the fullness of time of the Gentiles came, God sent Elijah because that was his most faithful prophet spirit. He sends Elijah to turn the people back. It was Elijah who rebuilt the altar. It was Elijah who called fire down from heaven. It was Elijah and then Elisha came with a double portion of Elisha. And they and then and then came John the Baptist in the spirit of Elias but didn't do any miracles. He only had a message. &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world to turn the people's hearts back to him. [Music] &gt;&gt; Then when brother Brandham came, he had both miracles and a message &gt;&gt; because it's the fullness of the Gentiles &gt;&gt; and the gospel will go back to the Jews. There's an awakening happening there in Israel. And there's awakening happening here. &gt;&gt; There's awakening happening amongst the bride. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so this fullness, there's a fullness of the Gentiles. Paul said, "For I, brethren, for I would not, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise, this mystery, &gt;&gt; that you should be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in part has happened to Israel until &gt;&gt; Jesus said the law and the prophets was until John." &gt;&gt; And now the Apostle Paul is coming and he's prophesying and he's saying that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become him. &gt;&gt; In Ephesians, he said that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ. He couldn't gather all things into Christ if Christ remained partially a mystery. &gt;&gt; He couldn't gather them into Christ because Christ is the word. If the seals were never open, he had to have a vindicated messenger with orders to come and open the seals or to speak the opening. Brother Brandham didn't open the seals. The lamb opened the seals. The prophet of God was the mouthpiece to speak what was open. &gt;&gt; The opening of those seas seals was signaling the end &gt;&gt; of an era. and the opening of another era [Applause] &gt;&gt; that in the dispensation of the fullness of times. The fullness of times is connected to the gathering in one being Christ all things both which are in heaven and that which is in earth &gt;&gt; even into him. &gt;&gt; How could they be gathered into him if he remained a mystery? &gt;&gt; The mystery had to be made known. The mystery of the serpent seed had to be made known. The mystery of the godhead had to be known. We can't worship a a a trinity of gods or a multiplicity of gods. We worship God himself &gt;&gt; revealed as a father, as a son, and in the holy spirit. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? Amen. &gt;&gt; In the seventh seal, I'm talking about the fullness. In the seventh seal, he said, "We must remember that the seventh seal is the end time of all things." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the end. &gt;&gt; It is the end of the struggling world. It is the end of the struggling nature. It's the end of everything. It's the end of the trumpets. It's the end of the vials. It's the end of the earth. It's even the end of time. Time runs out. Everything runs out in this time. The end of the seventh seal. And here we are right in the midst of it. We're in the winding up. We're in the fullness. We've heard the concluding messenger. He's already gave his message. There won't be another one. &gt;&gt; If you're waiting for better meetings, they may never come. Jump in right now. &gt;&gt; Jump in and say, "Here I am, Lord." Pour it in. Pour it in. Pour it in. Pour revelation into me. Pour zeal into me. Don't let this world make us to become kind of lopsided and and lukewarm. We deny the world. We deny that lukewarm spirit. We deny the soft light. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's just all excitement." I say, "Give me more. &gt;&gt; Give me more of this kind of excitement. &gt;&gt; Let me be carried right out of my house." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Into the realms of the spirit. be lifted up into the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; This is a reality. &gt;&gt; And when you finally realize, friend, I want everybody in this building, this isn't going to come your way again. &gt;&gt; This is coming your way now. &gt;&gt; There's not going to be another message. There's not going to be the seals open again. They have been open. [Applause] the perfect will of God. &gt;&gt; Now you'll have a different revelation every time you say the Lord's Prayer. &gt;&gt; Our Father, which art in heaven, &gt;&gt; Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. &gt;&gt; Thy will be done. And brother Brandham says on the seventh seal, I have it here somewhere my notes. He says we shouldn't think it's been that this is strange. And he mentions the Colin boy Collins boy and the girl healed from luccomia leukemia rather. He said what it is. It's the kingdom of God coming. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Healing is just a small part of it. This is the healing. This is the kingdom of God coming. the opening of this seventh seal and the and all the other seals. This is the kingdom of God coming. &gt;&gt; Hey, we pray thy will be done and everybody prays it and God does it and they miss it. &gt;&gt; It's a kingdom of God coming. &gt;&gt; He said more and more from the negative to the positive &gt;&gt; as it has been. &gt;&gt; It's been happening. Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; The perfect will of God, &gt;&gt; which is the completion, the completed the the the what was set out, the definite goal and the point that God had in his mind. He said, "Who gave himself for our sins, Galatians 1:4, that he might deliver us from the present evil world according to the will of God." All of this happened to deliver you and I &gt;&gt; from this present &gt;&gt; evil world. &gt;&gt; And you young people especially, you will perhaps if time goes on, you will contend with things that I don't have to contend with. But this message came to deliver you from this present evil world. And this world is not getting better and it's not improving. It's becoming more wicked, more vile, more uh flagrant with its evil. It'll pour it out on you. It'll in an insidious way. It'll put it in the on the shopping centers. It'll put it on the clothes racks. It'll put it before our children in school. That's why I'm so thankful for the school that is here and the Holy Ghost teachers that they can give our children an atmosphere &gt;&gt; to nurture &gt;&gt; the spiritual life. &gt;&gt; It's not going to come less &gt;&gt; in the school system. It's going to come more. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "You can't outsmart him. &gt;&gt; Don't think you're going to outsmart him. He is so slick. &gt;&gt; He knows the Bible better than any of us. &gt;&gt; But he has no revelation. &gt;&gt; And this is the revelation we have. This is the word. He can't even get a hold of it. &gt;&gt; Deliver us. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. deliver us from this present evil world. &gt;&gt; To deliver, the word even is to choose out for oneself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In delivering you, it isn't it just that he frees you and cuts some bondages off. He chooses you for himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's the untouchable one. &gt;&gt; Christ is untouchable. He's already been He's already uh satisfied the judgment of God with the full curse at Calvary. He's the untouchable one. &gt;&gt; He's the mighty conqueror. &gt;&gt; And you can say today, I am in the mighty conqueror. &gt;&gt; I am untouchable in him. [Applause] When the fullness of the Gentiles arrived in the fullness of times, God sent forth this last messenger. In the fullness of the Gentiles, in the fullness of times, a messenger to the age always comes at the end of the age. And so, this is the end of the age. I'm going to hurry along now. In the what is the attraction? And he says, "And God of heaven promised the evening time would have an evening light. And three years ago, this mystery was a prophecy." &gt;&gt; He said, "What time is it, sir? But now it's history. It's passed. The promise is fulfilled." He said, "Just three years ago, this was a mystery. Today, it's history. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be looking at things and think that they're a mystery when in fact, they may already be history. We're not sitting here &gt;&gt; to just, like I say, be rocked to sleep. &gt;&gt; We're here to be shaken &gt;&gt; and moved. [Music] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be looking at things and think it's a mystery waiting to be revealed when in fact it's already history. And he said this in modern events. He said, "What a time it is that we're living in." He said, "We're living in the bride age." The calling uh bringing back to God through a channel that he promised to bring it back in. &gt;&gt; Look at that was a modern events made clear. This was just a few hours before he was leaving. &gt;&gt; This is this is one of his last messages. &gt;&gt; Rapture, modern events made clear. Things that things that are to be in modern events made clear. That was and then the last message was leadership. There's a second last message. He's saying it's already happened. &gt;&gt; Can I read that again for you? &gt;&gt; What time is it? &gt;&gt; He's asking the people that are there, what time is it? And I take those words and repeat them this morning. Not because we're back there, because we're up here. But we can say the same word. What time is it, folks? What time is it? &gt;&gt; He said, "We're living in the bride age." I say, "We're living in the time of the bride's been called." &gt;&gt; But we are living in the bride age. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. The bride's been called. &gt;&gt; Dear ones, young ones, the bride's been called. &gt;&gt; You are the youth of that calling. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Don't take this one lightly. This thing's been on my heart and in my bosom for weeks. &gt;&gt; Oh God, give me the strength and give me the words. I pray that the Holy Spirit would take the words and plant it directly into your heart. &gt;&gt; We're not living I'm not here to speak to you about history, speak to you about something that's been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; We're living in the bride age and the calling back to God through a channel. and the channel was standing right in front of them and they didn't miss they missed it completely went straight over their head &gt;&gt; in leadership the very last message he goes on he says as Moses called a nation out of a nation Christ today &gt;&gt; is calling a church out of a church and Christ right at that day was calling a church out of a church and they missed it &gt;&gt; and here we are the church of the living God &gt;&gt; called by the living word of God. My friends, this isn't just some other uh other doctrine to get excited about. This isn't some mental gymnastics. This is the truth that's burning in our soul. &gt;&gt; What was the attraction on the mount? He says, "What was the attraction was because scripture was being fulfilled?" &gt;&gt; That's why there's such a burning. That's why there's such an excitement. Scripture is being fulfilled. Not has been, is being fulfilled. [Applause] [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; The same thing in type. He said, "Taking them to the glorious eternal promised land." Not just the promised land of Israel, but to the eternal promised land. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the in the end time message, he said, "And oh, I'm so glad to be on the earth now just before the break of day." &gt;&gt; That was 1954. Listen, I'm I'm taking you. I hope you're following me now in the sequence. I'm showing you as it was there in his earlier ministry. Here it is here in his later ministry. And here we are here. &gt;&gt; Then I'm going to come to future home. I've got to really move. says, "I'm so glad to be on the earth now." Just before the break of day, herald the message of his blessed appearing. He He knew back then in 54. He knew he was heralding. He knew he was the heralder. He knew he was the messenger. He knew he had been sent with an announcement to tell the people, "This is the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ." And behold, the fig leaves now are becoming green, &gt;&gt; and the gospel of the kingdom is sweeping to every nation. And we're near the end can be seen. And then we come to 64 in shalom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; From 54 to 64. Now we come 10 years. He said, God who made the promise in the last days these things would happen that we see happen. He says, "If he the promised son and the promised son came, if he promised all these things that we see through the scriptures, and it did, let's get into the rhythm of it." &gt;&gt; So, he wasn't saying, "Oh, it's coming." He was saying, "It's here. &gt;&gt; Get into the rhythm of it now." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I say the beat has gone on and I want to be in the beat. I want to be in the rhythm, not even of 64, but this time 2010. &gt;&gt; God didn't stop back there. &gt;&gt; God didn't finish it back there. &gt;&gt; It's happening today while you're sitting here. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. [Applause] [Music] Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Get into the rhythm of it. &gt;&gt; He said, "The dawning of a new day." He didn't say, "I can see it coming." He says, "It's the dawning of a new day." This is happening. It's in the He said, "I feel it all over me. The light of a new day." the light of a day where there is no night. Once God starts it, it's already started. We can't stop it. It's not going to have any interruptions. It's going to come right to the eternal day &gt;&gt; where there's no night and there's no darkness and no shadows, no skies to dim, no dark skies, no midnights, no graves, no flowers on the hillsides, no funeral section. Say, "Oh God, give me that time." And we've been called. You've been called into it. &gt;&gt; That's what God did for you at camp. &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you what happened at camp. It's just another step in this great movement. It's just another step on the way to the hillsides where there'll be no more flowers, there'll be no more graves, there'll be no more funeral possessions, there'll be no storms, there'll be no disasters. That's what you've been called to. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; don't spurn this invitation. &gt;&gt; Don't spurn this invitation, &gt;&gt; my dear little ones, &gt;&gt; because he's not going to give it again. When the king sent out his servant and said, "Go and invite them." And they were busy and had their things to do. He never said, "Go back and try and persuade them. &gt;&gt; Just leave them to their things. &gt;&gt; I'm busy with my auction and I'm busy. I bought a piece of ground. I'm busy with this and I'm busy with that." Leave them to it. &gt;&gt; Now go out again and get the halt and the maimed and the blind. And so and he goes out again. He says in the second pole, "And there's still more room." says, "Go into the highways and the byways." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Get the drunkards and the alcoholics and the prostitutes and get those that are blasphemers and get them all. Get the dopers and the drug addicts. Get them all. Get the religious one. Get them all. &gt;&gt; Persuade them to come in. [Music] He said now &gt;&gt; the darkness is separating &gt;&gt; itself from the light. &gt;&gt; That's what he now was seeing. It changed from 54 to 64 and it changed even further &gt;&gt; from 64 till now. Many of these people rejected it. But now we hear the same message and the same messenger and we say it's for me. &gt;&gt; He said God caused it &gt;&gt; and the light's doing it. &gt;&gt; You've heard me maybe preach on it if you remember. He said the light's pressing itself. &gt;&gt; The light is pressing itself in such a way until the darkness has to congregate together. You say, "Why is this terrible wickedness happening?" It's the light that's pressing it. &gt;&gt; The light is squeezing the darkness. Light is greater than darkness. And the light is squeezing the darkness, calling it to coagulate, if you would, causing it to condense. &gt;&gt; It becomes the evil becomes gross evil. The darkness, gross darkness, the filth and uncleanness, vile. It's because a light is pressing it. and separating from it and they're just given over to straight darkness &gt;&gt; and the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit fil people &gt;&gt; are going to leave this world &gt;&gt; and I say to you in the name of the Lord you don't want to be here [Music] &gt;&gt; I just want to say to you I feel like I'm announcing some things today I really do. &gt;&gt; I felt I was going to come to the pulpit with announcement to let you know that we're a lot further down the road &gt;&gt; than perhaps you have realized. &gt;&gt; We can't take it just kind of hung ho, you know, easy. No, no more. &gt;&gt; He said, I'm sure that you've noticed the seventh seal. I'm sure that you've noticed the thing that's been happening this week. The kingdom of God is coming. &gt;&gt; That's quite an announcement. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is coming &gt;&gt; and it's becoming more and more from the negative to the positive as it has been. We're just drawing closer to God all the time. &gt;&gt; Our heavenly father, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Let your pleasure be done. And he's saying it's being done. I'm calling them and they're responding. They're coming into this new day. They're coming into this glorious light. &gt;&gt; Can I have a little more time? &gt;&gt; Then we we're not going to squeeze in on Tom's time tonight, but I want to get I want to get this now. I have I have some slides and I want to get to it. Speaking of our future home, I gave you a little background right at the very beginning. He speaks of the three stages of the earth. He goes into the eighth day and all speaking of eternity. &gt;&gt; I might as well drop my bomb right now. &gt;&gt; This message and this messenger actually was ordained to usher you into eternity. That's the purpose &gt;&gt; of such a phenomenal ministry &gt;&gt; to usher you into eternity. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham, he only used the phrase the phrase. Now listen to me carefully. Feast of the tabernacles. Feast of Tabernacles. He referred to feasts and tabernacles and so on and other places, but he only used the phrase feast of tabernacles four times. And they're all in the future home. Because the future home, the very message is the very word of God coming to the believing bride to let her know this word is going to take you to a change. &gt;&gt; This word is ordained. It's already been seasoned with the eternal word of God. From the thought of God, this this messenger is going to call my family. I'm going to lead them. This is the calling out of the bride. I'll give them the sign of the resurrection. They'll believe it. I'll give them the sign of the Messiah and they'll believe it. I'll send all these announcements and they'll believe it. And then I'll I'll notify them about the future home and I'll talk to them about the the the feast of the tabernacles. &gt;&gt; And at the feast of tabernacles, I'll have my messenger take them to the last day of the feast of the tabernacles to show them that it's that day is not even in the in the calendar. It's not the Sabbath. It's not the great day of the feast of the Sabbath, but it's a day after on the morning after because it was on the eighth day that Jesus our Sabbath raised. &gt;&gt; It was on the eighth day that the Holy Ghost came to give birth to the church &gt;&gt; because he took him into eternity. And the messenger had to bring it to you and I to realize this is a message of the eighth day. &gt;&gt; He said the seventh day speaks of time. &gt;&gt; But the eighth day speaks of eternity. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Three stages of the earth and the world out of out of Peter's gospel. Let me get myself organized here where we read the world that then was the heavens and the earth which are now and the new heavens and the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness in the future home and the three stages of the world once again the old world that stood out of the water which was the that was the Andalivian world the present world we live in now and the world that is to come the new world It means from passing from one thing. When it says pass away, it's the passing from one thing to another. To pass from one condition, it says to another. What does it mean? The earth will be loosed from the grip of Satan. It'll be loosed. It'll be loosed from politics. It'll be loosed from denominational religion systems. It'll be used for the kingdom of God to be established here on the earth. Do you realize that, friends? Whether you're in Washington, British Columbia, or California, or wherever it is, regardless of how vile or how wicked, you realize that France and Paris and the UK and London and all of these places and whether off into Russia or down into down into Africa, this world, God created it for himself. &gt;&gt; And righteousness is going to be in Kinshasa. Righteousness is going to be in Johannesburg. Righteousness is going to be in San Francisco. Righteousness is going to be in Los Angeles. That place was given to God. He created it. It will be righteous. And listen friends, the messenger has come to make the announcement. &gt;&gt; And that's why he says this law is going to slide into the ocean &gt;&gt; and this wickedness is going to be done away with. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I feel like doing a dance. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; We established here on earth. He says, "One time it one time I was his property." Why don't you say that together? One time I was his property, but not now. &gt;&gt; But not now. He came to lose the grip of it. He loosed the grip of sin, of Satan upon my life, upon your life. And now we're not his. Why do we say that? Now we're not his. Let the devil know we're not his. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends. Elijah said that. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost said that &gt;&gt; by the spirit of Elijah. We're not his. &gt;&gt; The grip has been loose. You think he's got some strings tied to you? You announce to him this morning, I've been loosed from you. He loosed me from your grip. I don't care what your circumstances are in life. Our God is greater than those circumstances. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Have you often heard me say in prayer, Brother Bram says, "Take your hands off God's property." Amen. &gt;&gt; Have faith to claim your own. &gt;&gt; That's your right. &gt;&gt; Take your hands off her. &gt;&gt; Take your hands off him. &gt;&gt; Faith will do it. Maybe you need to say that. Take your hands off her. Take your hands off him. She's God's property. He's God's property. &gt;&gt; Loose him. [Music] &gt;&gt; He said it's the same word as when he stood at the grave of Lazarus and he called Lazarus forth. That was the supernatural. But he said to those that were around him, "Loose him." &gt;&gt; In other words, you put the rags on him, take them off. We're part of a world that has encumbered and enslaved people. Take it off. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're empowered by prayer. &gt;&gt; We're empowered by faith. &gt;&gt; Take it off. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was so blessed. Brother Roy said to Judy, "I saw one of your sons. I got him mixed up praying at the camp." &gt;&gt; He began to pray. I thought, "My goodness, &gt;&gt; this is glorious. &gt;&gt; Where's this young man been? &gt;&gt; I know many times you prayed, Brother Roy, Sister Judy, take your hands off. &gt;&gt; They're God's property. [Music] not annihilate it. Just take your hands off of it. &gt;&gt; Loose it and let it go. &gt;&gt; When a man's changed, he isn't annihilated, but he's he's a changed person. He's been changed from what he was to what he is. Not annihilated. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not by works of righteousness which we have done, said the Apostle Paul and Titus, but according to his mercy, he saved us by the washing of the regeneration. By washing of re regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit and the and the re the new birth uh let's have it here. He said the new birth hence renovation. I just want to get what what renovation is. the production of a new life consecrated to God. A radical change of mind for the better. Restored to its pristine state. And I have to underline that. Restored to its pristine state. We have the Holy Spirit has come to us through this message to restore you to your pristine state. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There'll be no artificial joints. &gt;&gt; I remember old brother, brother Herb Rutherford. He was laying in bed and I think he'd had some hip joints replaced and he had a rougher voice than I have. He said, "Brother Ed," he said, "What do you think?" He said, "When this change comes in this new body," he says, "I'm not going to have artificial hips there, am I?" I said, "No, boy." I said, "There's going to be a lot of stuff laying around, artificial knees and artificial joints and false teeth and glasses and all these things." Praise God. It's &gt;&gt; all going to be gone. It doesn't belong in the new world. [Applause] to our pristine state &gt;&gt; is the millennium. &gt;&gt; The millennium reign, the thousand years is not sorry is not the new earth. &gt;&gt; The thousand years is not the new earth. &gt;&gt; So he said the three stages, the millennium is not the new earth. It's not even the earth that's here now. No, I'll let him I'll let the prophet explain it. The millennium reign is a different reign and that's what we go into the millennium, but that isn't the new earth and the new earth. No, he said that's just a rest place, a rest period. Not at all the new heavens and the new earth. For in the millennium, we have things that we would not go into that. He said it's a type of the old seventh day of Eden. Remember the old seventh day of Eden when God rested, sin was there. There was failure within Adam and Eve at that time. And I'm not trying to put an interpretation to it, but I just say he said it's a type of the old seventh day of Eden. The seventh day after he made the world, the seventh day he rested in Eden. &gt;&gt; The millennium is a type of the seventh day. We're still in time in the millennium. It's a day, a thousand years. It's a time element. Don't get that mixed up with the new earth now because it's not. Now you say, I'm sorry. Now you say, brother Brandham, you're trying to put something way over yonder beyond the seventh day. Sabbath, as God made the earth and labored six days and rested, the seventh was only a type of time. But I just said here, we become eternal. Can you say amen? We become eternal. And then he said, "Let's take the last feast, which was the feast of tabernacles." And here's the scripture. Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord. On the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you. And you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord. It is a solemn assembly, and it shall and you shall do no survile work therein. You shall not do any work that reminds you of of slavery. You won't do any work that reminds you of the work you're doing now. &gt;&gt; You'll do no work on that eighth day because we've passed from that. We've passed from time into the eighth day. &gt;&gt; And this is not a message for time alone. This is a message to call you out of your old religion and call you out of your old life and call you out of your bondage and to loose you from the grip of Satan. But it's also a message to take you in because the messenger was one in the breach of time from time into eternity. &gt;&gt; Do you believe me? &gt;&gt; I sat as close as brother Tom is to me right now and and brother Brandon would say, "I'm in two worlds." &gt;&gt; Which world was he in? He was in this one and he was in the eternal realm. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why he could tell the person what you did last week. &gt;&gt; What you did just before you came to the service. You you slid a chair out in your bedroom and you you sat there. You kneel there and prayed and you prayed that I would call you. &gt;&gt; He said to one woman, "Do you want me to tell you what you prayed?" [Applause] &gt;&gt; He said, "You've been to you've been to the doctors." He said, "Two large men, quite large men. They're doctors." He says, and he said, "Do you want me to tell you what's on your report?" &gt;&gt; And then go and tell her what's going to be in the where is he? He's in eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To all the Catholic people that might ever listen to this, they never had a pope do such a thing. &gt;&gt; Never had a prespter do, never had a general overseer of the Pentecostal assemblies do the do such a thing. We are following. Are we following a message? Yes, we are. by a vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; And I'm not ashamed of that message in the messenger. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a what a gift from God that he would call you and I &gt;&gt; such as we are into such a into such a realm &gt;&gt; so he said let's take the last feast and we we read that now we got an eighth day &gt;&gt; on the eighth day &gt;&gt; and he says now there's only seven days but here we speak of the eighth day a holy convocation the eighth day is what back to the first day. What it speaks of eternity as she rolls around without a stopping place. Notice it also is upon the eighth day, the last day of the feast of the tabernacle. Notice after that, after the last feast day, after the last church age, after the last complete seven days upon the earth, after the millennium, that this holy convocation comes. &gt;&gt; For in the millennium, the Bible said they shall build houses and they shall inhabit them. But in the new earth, it's already went and prepared the place. It's built. We have nothing to do with the building of it. &gt;&gt; A holy convocation. The eighth day, which there's only seven days. Then on the eighth day, which comes back to the first day again, comes right back to the first day. The eighth day is a holy convocation. &gt;&gt; Eight days deals with the new creation, not old creation. 8 days is a new creation. For it was on the eighth day that our Lord Jesus raised from the dead. Hallelujah. He never went back to that grave. &gt;&gt; He never went back to that tomb. He never went back to Calvary or Golgatha. He was a new creation. [Music] &gt;&gt; Eighth day, which is a holy convocation, which is the first day. You've done pass through time and dropped into eternity again. Not the keeping of days and keeping of Sabbath and new moons and things like that, but have passed changed your form. Not annihilated, but passed from death unto eternal. &gt;&gt; Not will be, we have passed. &gt;&gt; And the messenger came to let us know that we those that have eternal life have always had eternal life. You've always been eternal. He just came to tell you you are eternal. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Help me out. I'm trying to go quickly here now so you can be done. And you shall count on you. You shall count unto you from the tomorrow after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheath of the wave offering. Now we're to the wave sheath. You shall count. This is another part of the scripture. You shall count. Leviticus the 15th verse of chapter 23. You shall count unto you from the tomorrow after the Sabbath. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From the day that you brought the sheath of the wave offering, seven Sabbath shall be complete. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; After 50 days or seven Sabbaths, Brother Brandham said, from there again there come another holy convocation. what happened? The Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost on the eighth day. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And Christ uh was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth." He was the first fruits of those that slept in the Bible in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church. There will have to be a sheath waved again in the last days. There will have to be a sheath waved again in the last days. &gt;&gt; Who was the sheath that was waved &gt;&gt; at the resurrection? &gt;&gt; Was Christ in another form? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Put on your thinking cap now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And there'll have to be another one. He's making an announcement. The message is full of announcements. And there'll have to be another chief wave. Now, this is in the rising of the sun. There'll have to be another wave sheath coming in this bride coming of Christ and the fullness of the word. It couldn't come till the seals were opened because the sheath is Christ. &gt;&gt; And that's why he preached the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ. And that's why he preached, I indict this generation, not that generation or another one coming. I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ because the word come and they crucified it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But when they crucified him that time, did it stop him? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Say it again. Did it stop him? No. It never stopped him. He just continued on with the program. He was buried and raised again. And not only raised again, then he was raised according to this scripture in Leviticus as a memorial to God. &gt;&gt; And he was waved over the people. &gt;&gt; That there were more like him still in the field. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was waved over this earth. He dropped his blood on it first. Then he raised in the resurrection and was waved over it. And when he ascended, he was waved over it. Father, there's more like me. &gt;&gt; There's more like me. &gt;&gt; There's more word in flesh down there. &gt;&gt; There's others that are going to live being the word in flesh. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Waving the sheath. What was the chief? The first one that come to mature. The first one that proved it was a wheat. That proved it was a &gt;&gt; chief. He said if there would be a holy ritual, it should come forth on the Sabbath, which was the seventh day of the week, which is Saturday. But did you notice in this memorial to wave it on the first day of the week the sheath which was the first of your seed that you planted when it comes up and ripens you cut it down this sheath and take it to the priest and let him take it and wave it before the Lord for your acceptation that you are accepted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were accepted before you were born. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You were accepted when you were laying in the earth. &gt;&gt; Before your body was formed, &gt;&gt; before your father put seed in your mother's womb, you were accepted. &gt;&gt; And the accepted one will never be discredited and set aside. You're accepted. Now, for those of you for the younger ones, I've said this many times before, but I'll just go over it very, very quickly because I'm trying to watch my time. I didn't have my watch on. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The scripture says this, when you come into the land, &gt;&gt; so it didn't put a special day on. It says, "When you come into the land and you've sew in your fields, the first ripe grain, the first ripe grain, because it was all Christ, the first ripe one was the first one who came to maturity, the first one who could prove, as brother Brandham says, the first one that could prove he was a wheat." &gt;&gt; Now, that was back there. That is why when you read the messages, you'll hear the prophet say, "Now, if I have told you the truth, let him come now and prove &gt;&gt; I told you the truth." In other words, if I have spoke the ripe grain to you, if I've presented the wheat sheath to you, if I've presented the absolute truth to you, then let him who gave the word come and prove it. And did he? Every time. Every time. Every time he proved it. &gt;&gt; So there had to be another chief at this time. That's why he said there had to be another one at this time. But if you live back then, your parents, he says, "When you come into the land," because they, you know, it it wasn't a certain day they came in when they came in. Then they planted their field, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And then the grain grew. But if you've been around on a farm, it never all ripens at the same time. There'll be some that comes ripe first. &gt;&gt; And you take that first one, that first sheath, and you cut it down because that was to that would to describe explicitly that Christ would be the first one to come to maturity and they cut him down. &gt;&gt; He was cut down to the cross and to death &gt;&gt; and they had to play a part in that. Why? It was your sins and mine that put them there. &gt;&gt; So, you play a part in it. &gt;&gt; And you cut the sheath down. And when you've cut the sheath down, don't take it to Oh, man. If you were here for a second season, second session this afternoon, I could start right now. You don't take it to the prophet. He didn't say go and take this to Moses &gt;&gt; or go and take it to Joshua. Moses wasn't there yet. He didn't say take it to someone else. You take it to the priest. &gt;&gt; Jesus could not do this as the God prophet. &gt;&gt; He had to die, shed his blood, take his own blood, ascend it, and then be waved over the people because it was only the priest that could wave it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; At the beginning of the priesthood, he waved it. &gt;&gt; At the beginning of the priesthood, there was a waving that there was more like him. But at the end, &gt;&gt; at the end of mercy and at the end of the priesthood comes the full word again. And that's why Jesus said, "Who is this MelzDC? It's another priesthood. &gt;&gt; Not Aaron. But who's this Melzdc? Who is this one that's showing himself? Who did she touch? opportunity touch the high priest, but it was the ending of mercy at the ending of the age. &gt;&gt; Don't get me wrong now, but at the end of the age, there had to be another waving &gt;&gt; because now the full word had come, had been crucified, cut down, and they couldn't stop it. [Music] &gt;&gt; They said all kinds of nasty things. &gt;&gt; You folks to live through it all. When we gathered in the little house, Brother Don, Sister Gur were there, few others perhaps, Sister Violet Law, they called us tapeworms, these po people to go and they listened to tapes and they made it as spooky as they could and they shut off all the lights. Isn't that what they said? And they they shut off all the lights in the darkness and they don't believe in music and they're a weird cult and they made it as spooky as possible and they're a bunch of tapeworms. Well, one lady finally one lady came in one day and she sat down and we were in the log church then and she heard the people singing their lungs out and heard them playing their music and heard them shouting and they're praising God like she she came up to me. She says, "I heard that you people don't believe in music." I said, "Where'd you hear that?" Well, she says, "Some people told me you don't believe in music." I said, "Of course we believe in music." What? And she was so moved by the whole thing. I tell you one thing, she knew that whoever spoke to her was telling lies &gt;&gt; and it still carries on &gt;&gt; what what these people are. &gt;&gt; All these people, &gt;&gt; I'm so glad I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; All right, I'm just finishing right now for your acceptation. He said, "Notice it was the first of God, the first corn of God's wheat that had been raised from the dead by God's quickening power. God had quickened his life, raised him from the dead. He was the first fruits of them that slept. He was that she chief. That's why they had to wave that sheath for it was the first one that came to maturity. It was the first one." I will say this, I'm coming to a close just now in a couple minutes. I want you to take this real serious. Jesus was the sinless. He was the sinless son of God, tempted in all points like you and I are and yet without sin. and he was the first sheath that came to maturity and was cut down and waved before God. But that was not God's whole program. God wanted to take a sinner that had been cleansed by the blood of this lamb. &gt;&gt; He wanted to take a sinner that even tried to commit suicide. &gt;&gt; He wanted to take a sinner that hated people. He wanted to take a sinner as brother Brennham said he was a sinner &gt;&gt; and he tried attempted to do these things and then then and then one day but God's hand was on him &gt;&gt; and God wanted to take a sinner and bring him to that full maturity &gt;&gt; so that we would see hey it's not just Jesus Christ someone who came from heaven's uh glories hey God can take a sinner &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of a sinner you've been I don't care what you've done God want to break a sinner. &gt;&gt; That's his pleasure. &gt;&gt; His pleasure is the cross work, the sacrifice work. He can take a sinner and bring him to full redemption [Applause] &gt;&gt; and bring them to maturity. &gt;&gt; Then we understand more what it's like to say to be like Jesus. Now the last the last one believing and it was waved as a memorial of thanksgiving to God believing that the rest of them would come. I say to you to those that are streaming to all who will ever hear this voice and they have come. &gt;&gt; I want you to get beyond that you're just part of a church or part of Bible way or any other church. You're part of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; They're in Bolivia. They're in Peru. They're in Argentina. They're in South Africa. They're in Zambia. They're in uh they're in Nairobi. They're all over the world. They're in Nigeria. They're in Congo. They're in Belgium. They're in France. They're in Germany. They're in Russia. They're in the Ukraine. They're all over. It's a glorious bride of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; to your friends. Brother Brandma crossed over and he saw millions, &gt;&gt; millions. &gt;&gt; He said, "I saw you all there." [Music] &gt;&gt; I just want to ask you, did he see you? &gt;&gt; Does your faith say he saw me? &gt;&gt; This messenger saw me? &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, that's too great." Did God see you then? Amen. &gt;&gt; God saw you. &gt;&gt; You're part of that number. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have a reason to rejoice. &gt;&gt; We have a reason to shout. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; They screamed and threw their toques in the air and everything else at the Olympics. The Olympics. What's the Olympics? &gt;&gt; Olympics is nothing. &gt;&gt; All the games are nothing. We're in the greatest race of all time. &gt;&gt; And God chose for you to be here at the very last lap. [Music] &gt;&gt; You talk about the podium. We're going to stand on the podium. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Having overcome the devil. &gt;&gt; And sin, the deceiver. [Music] You think that Jesus was waved in vain? &gt;&gt; No, he was not waved in vain. He was he was he was waved because the the the people were there in the field and now we've come. &gt;&gt; If it was a memorial to God then, forgive me for just taking this minute, but if it was a memorial to God then and God rejoiced in that memorial, think think what he what what's in the heart of God when he sees the product of it. [Music] And &gt;&gt; here's the last one. You You came by predestination. &gt;&gt; And there's the genuine holy convocation. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We're entering the holy convocation. We're entering into that real genuine eternity &gt;&gt; where the church is called not some station or some denomination, but into eternity where with their eternal king. We don't have it uh at all. He said, "Why don't we have it at have it have it at all? There's no such a thing as days and things of times. You've passed into eternity where you come from." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You were there to begin with. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Future home. &gt;&gt; Future home. &gt;&gt; That's why you've been called. I think we ought to stand and sing. &gt;&gt; Uh either the young people sang it the other day and I I I don't have all the words but all I have in it I have that phrase shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's say thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I want to shout hallelujah. You know that it's good after you heard the word to worship. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Let's just worship for a few moments. &gt;&gt; Let our spirits enter into worship. [Music] &gt;&gt; Who's coming to Brother Derek coming to give us a hand here? [Music] I'm just made up so that when I sing, the Bible says we do it with all of our heart. &gt;&gt; We've got something wonderful to worship for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When I think about the Lord, how he saved me, how he raised me, how he filled me with the Holy Ghost, how he healed me to the other. When I think about the Lord, how he takes me up, turn me around, how he solid ground. [Music] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, you're worthy of all the glory and all the honor and all the praise. [Music] Oh, hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. For you're worthy of all the glory and all the honor and all the praise. Hallelujah. When I think about the Lord, how he saved me, how he raised me, how he fil me with the Holy Ghost, how he healed me to the other. When I think about the Lord, how he meal [Music] [Music] Jesus. Yes.

I believe it's going to be a glorious time. &gt;&gt; But I think we need to sing and worship. There's people almost everywhere and they are &gt;&gt; whose hearts are all a flame with the fire that fell at Pentecost. Didn't only fall pentecost, it fell here. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Brother Kim, brother uh brother Randy and brother Milco, some that are going, Brother Machmood and his wife are going and I'm so happy about that.
