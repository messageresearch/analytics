[music] Lord, you are our great high praise, God. You're here this morning, oh God. All our counsel for our souls are pray Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We have to ask her Derek Paris Der for the service in the word of prayer. Got a couple of testimonies. Sister Marjorie Miles [music] says, "I thank the Lord for his faithfulness. Thanks also to my pastor and all the ministers, deacons, brothers and sisters in Christ for your prayers, love and kindness to me. I believe the Lord is the great physician. And our brother Eddie Childers said, "We'd like to thank you for your prayers, your visits, phone calls, and for the love offering. [music] Words cannot express what this means to us. I've been off IV nutrition and lime free for 3 weeks. For 22 years, I have never been without an IV. that after 22 years of IV nutrition, [music] 16 surgeries, multiple hospital stays, I believe God has and is bringing about the manifestation of my healing. &gt;&gt; May God be given all the glory, honor, and praise. Amen. We've got requests this morning uh from our brother Jim Jones. And many remember brother Jim. Uh I've been up here visiting a couple of times and he's uh thing may be listening in on the line now on the internet. We just uh want to pray this morning for arthritis that has affected his sciatic nerve. [music] He's scheduled for surgery but knows God can heal him. Amen. So we want to pray for brother Jim this morning. There's a request from our sister Patty Pettingill that we pray for her mother who's in the hospital with pneumonia and uh her nephew Scott needs a complete heart and lung transplant. Um and uh her sister Linda who's in a nursing home with severe [music] edema in her legs. So, Sister Patty's requesting prayer these relatives of her that are very afflicted. Also, there's a testimony and a prayer request for Brotherh Vineyard. Last week, he fell 15 ft at work [music] and landed on his head and his shoulder. And he says, uh, breaking my collar, but we would like to give the Lord all the praise and glory for sparing my life. This kind of accident could have been so much worse. Please keep us in prayer because I might have to go for surgery to repair my soul shoulder. So, let's just pray for brother Bob this morning. God would touch him. And if you've got a need this morning, if you're here in our midst or if you're listening in, uh just lift your request to the Lord. Amen. He's aware of each and every one of our needs. Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, Lord, you're a mighty God. Lord, your grace is sufficient this morning, Lord. The needs that have been brought before you this morning by your children, Lord, have been brought in faith, Lord Jesus, believing that you had done it once, Lord, and that you would come once more, Father. Lord, that you would meet the requests of our brother Jones. Father, Lord, Sister Patty, Father, and Faith has written down the request, Lord, for loved ones, Lord. Lord, there might be those that have a organ that's out of place. Father, would you come and provide the strength, Lord, needed in the body to bring that back to its rightful position, Lord? [music] Lord, this morning for this service, Father, we're looking to the unseen this morning, Lord, as Abraham looked beyond the promise, Lord. He could not contain it in that hour which he stood, Lord, but you gave him a promise, Lord, and he held on to that promise. &gt;&gt; Lord, we're looking this morning to your word, Father God, that you would speak to each and every heart that's been gathered here this morning. Lord, may we cry out, Father, if there be a need in our lives, Lord, the hands have been raised. Come and meet every need, Lord Jesus, in divine presence. Those on the internet, Lord, on the telephone hookup, Lord, may be in a wayward state, Father, but Lord, looking for a touch of Jehovah to come upon their lives, Lord, would you do your eternal work this morning, Lord Jesus? [music] Father, drive out the fear in our lives, Lord. Take out every unclean spirit, Lord, that would hinder your children, Lord, from receiving from your throne of grace. Lord, we're desiring to hear from you. Lord, take our pastor, Lord, may as the vessel has prepared, Lord, and as he stands behind this sacred desk, Father, may you speak divinely to each and every heart, Lord, for you know the needs that we have need of. You know the walk that we have, Lord, and where we should be. Father, if we're not where we ought to be, Lord, would you bring us higher? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe we could just worship you for a moment. &gt;&gt; Lord, how lovely you are. &gt;&gt; How wonderful your grace is, Lord Jesus, in our lives, Lord. Give us a liberty, Father, to praise you and to worship you, Lord Jesus. Lord, may there be such a sweet atmosphere here this morning, Lord, that you would feel comfortable, Lord, to come down and just walk amongst us this morning, as you did with Adam and Eve in the cool of the evening, Lord, walking hand in hand with your children, Lord. Come and minister to our hearts, oh God. Take us beyond this realm of the flesh, Lord, and let us look into that realm of eternity, Father. draw us closer unto thee. We ask it, Father, in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. You may be seated. Want [clears throat] to welcome everyone this morning and in particular those who are visiting with us. We're happy to have each and every one of you here this morning. Good to see brother Brad Johnson.

You miserable this morning? &gt;&gt; Oh, there's a couple said no. Amen. I'm glad I'm redeemed. Praise God. We got a baby baby dedication this morning. Uh, brother Chris and Sister uh Brenda Maritz are going to bring their little one. And while they're coming, let's sing I am so glad that our father in heaven tells of his love in the book he has given. I am [music] so glad that our father in heaven tells of his [singing] love in the book he has written. Wonderful [music] things in the Bible I see. This is the [music] dear that Jesus loves. Oh, I am so glad that Jesus [music] loves me. Jesus loves me. Oh, I know Jesus loves me. Oh, I am so gladus [music] loves me. Jesus loves me. Oh, [music] I am so gladus. Jesus [music] loves me. Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, we're going to be dedicating uh another little one. And we all were this size once. You don't remember it, but it was an important time for the parents, your parents. I I'm certain of that. in this important time for brother Chris and sister Brenda bring their little one here. Uh looks like she's been well fed, well looked after. We want to uh dedicate. She has a different name. I couldn't find that name anywhere. It must have been right from South Africa. Lizel, &gt;&gt; I say leisel. Leisel. All right. And uh I'm forgiven because I couldn't find it anywhere. She she won't run into it elsewhere. I don't think Leisel Rebecca and Leisel because I wanted to find out. You know, lots of times parents tell me what the name means, but I like to confirm what it is. And and I had to take uh Brother Chris and Sister Brenda's word. It's consecrated to God. And her second name Rebecca, servant of God. And I took those which means consecrated is the same in the scripture is dedicated. And to dedicate actually has direct reference to that which is renewed or new. And I thought of Lisel as a she's a as far as physically is concerned she's a new creature in humanity but not a new creature in Christ yet. She hasn't had that experience of course but there is uh something I thought was very very outstanding and I'll just tell you what it is to consecrate which is something that's new in respects to her form. She's new. God is so great. There'll never be another one like her. &gt;&gt; There's only one. The fingerprints on her 10 little fingers are all different from all six billion of humanity. She is, the scripture says in in dedicate. She's unique. She's new. She's fresh. She's uncommon. Not common. uncommon, completely different. Isn't it marvelous how our God has made each one? And then in respect to her kind, this is unprecedented and novel and different. You know, it's it's marvelous when we think how unique they are. Now, we have children that are just born and some are unwanted and some are sent off to homes and so on so forth. But I'm so thankful that Leisel has been born into a home of a dedicated mother and father. And that's important. It's hard for me to dedicate a child if I don't know that the parents are dedicated. I was here the other night and brother Chris is working up preparing the new video edit studio. And when you see people give themselves and they haven't spent days but have spent hours and weeks and months up there, that is the best example for a child. And this is what brother Brandham has said. You've no doubt heard this before, but he said, "Your life will impress your children and influence your children by the example that you set before them." And I think it's a good thing that we put every effort before our children as godly parents and make an example and be an example. If you ever run into a a difficult time with this child, both of you want to be able to look up and said, "Father, we did everything. We knew what to do. We took her to the house of God. She was under the influence of the gospel. She felt the presence of God. She saw people moved. She saw people healed. She saw the supernatural. And we did everything. And now your messenger prophet said to us that if we would be this example that would influence her. And I believe in that. I believe in that. I believe it's very hard for parents to have been slothful in their spiritual life and have not lived a dedicated life and then run into a a time when they really need to call on God and say, "How do you have confidence? How do you have confidence to pray?" But when you do this and you live that example and the Bible tells us about this influence and brother Bram spoke about it and that is that is the inflow. There's something from each of you that is going to flow into her. An inflow that will modify her life that doesn't bother me. I raise some. Amen. I'm going to dedicate Leisel Rebecca. Amen. Let's pray. Father, this is such a privilege for me to hold this child in front of her mother and father. A gem that you have given, a spirit that came from God. And Father, I pray that with the heritage that she has, her grandparents that are here, Lord, Brother Paul and Sister Linda, and uh Lord Jesus, I think of her greatgrandparents, our brother Billy and Sister Betty Ratif, Father, and and Sister Brenda's parents that are here, our brother Tim and sister Susan. What a heritage she has. But it goes far beyond the human lineage, but into eternity. And I pray Lord that as I hold her, you will receive her as they have received her from you, as she is dedicated now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I pray, Lord, that you will take and watch over Leisel. I pray that you will keep her in good health. I ask that her heart will respond quickly &gt;&gt; when she hears the name of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit will hover over her and teach her the way of life. And Lord, and on that day that the circle will not be unbroken. But when we gathered that great marriage supper, let her walk down as that beautiful young lady that you have pictured in your mind. And may she, oh God, find the place where she has been ordained to sit and be there with her loved ones. Father, this is why I dedicate her to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. I can start preaching right now. God bless you, Chris. God bless you, Sister Brenda. We're going to have another song. We're going to have another song. Brother Rod is going to just come now just before we turn to the word. So happy you're all here. Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Praise God. This song I believe Sister Margaret is going to sing. Is that correct? And I'd like you to hear the words especially because it's so much in keeping with the messages we've been speaking in the last three weeks or so. And we'll continue on today, the Lord willing. Brother Rod, Sister Margaret, why don't you come? And while she's coming, let's sing together. We are standing on holy ground. We [music] are standing [singing] on holy [music] ground. And I know [music] that there are angels all around. [music] Let us praise. Let us praise [music] [singing] Jesus. Now [music] we are standing in [music] his presence. Glory. [music] Why have we [music] been distressed? [singing] Oh, we've been [music] troubled. So, what is it [music] that we've done? Have we transgressed [music] his [singing] laws? Let us search [singing] and [music] test our ways. and see where [singing] we've drunk. Let's forsake our own ways and he will make [music] us strong. Though he had cast out, but he will lift [music] up. Though he have broken, yet he will bind. [music] He hath wounded, but he will heal. With his [music] people, his covenant he'll keep. Let us search and [music] test our ways and see where [singing] we've drawn. [music] Let us lift our hands in praise and [music] worship him who's our God. For he had cast [music] down, but he will lift up. [music] Though he had broken, yet he will bind. He hath wounded, but he will heal with his people. [music] His covenant he'll keep. [music] For he had cast down, but he will lift up. [music] Though he had broken, yet he will bind. [music] He had wounded, but he will heal with his people. His [music] covenant he'll keep with his people. [music] His covenant he'll keep with his [music] people. His covenant he'll keep with his people. His covenant [music] he'll keep. With his people, his covenant will keep. &gt;&gt; Hey, just hold on to those words while we soon will be going to the word. Uh, I need to just make a couple of announcements. Uh, we met with the deacons this last weekend, the trustees, and I want I want to say to the congregation, you have a just a wonderful group of men. It was just so blessed after all of these years, years, and years. and and their concern with the people and for the church and for the gospel of Jesus Christ and just to think that you know we can meet and discuss so many things and concerns and yet it's just a blessed time of unity and to see the brothers enjoy one another. They have uh are requesting and so I'm making it because I believe that you will uh abide by by this because of our problem of of parking space and space everywhere. Uh we've had some of you have double parked and park along the side here and we cannot get in emergency vehicles if they're needed. Uh a fire truck or a rescue uh truck or an ambulance can't get to the door and they can't get move around. they can't get around in the parking lot. So, I'm going to request that you don't double park on the ends where they're uh just in the parking spaces and they're arranging now to have the areas striped and painted. So, you will not park in those areas. They will have to have the vehicles moved. Uh last Sunday we needed to get emergency vehicle in and uh one of the deacons was going all over through the church trying to find the people who were double parked and so we would request that you would not double park and I know that it's a problem you're parking on the street and up the street here and that will be our next thing we need to pray about to see if God will help us to maybe get a little bit more space than we have right now. the church, just so you know, as a congregation, the church purchased, uh, the house beyond brother Alex and Sister Walkinas, uh, it came up for sale. And I understand, I didn't find out till yesterday that one of the brothers in the church was kind of looking at it to he wanted to be near the church, so he was wanting to make an offer on it. And we didn't know that it was up for sale for quite a while. And anyway, we had purchased that property. It is u uh we thought that it was a good thing to do because it gives us if for per chance we had to try to make a little more room here. Uh the city wouldn't allow us to do anything, we didn't have enough parking space and that was our our big problem before. This would add a little piece of ground. Now we have two extra lots and the houses on them. But uh we're just looking to the Lord to see how God would guide us. We don't know what the future holds. This is a young congregation and if you sat down and and did the some of the, you know, some of the brief calculations that the brothers have done and the trustees have done, you'll find that uh I mean, we're we're dedicating babies. We dedicated one today. We've got one. We got two backed up and you know, they're just coming down the the line. And uh but it's a young congregation and you think we've been here now over 15 years. I think it'll be 15 years in January. And uh when you you think 5 years goes by just like that. I appreciate some of the brothers that I've been speaking to, fathers who got just young children, but they're already thinking terms of the school. They want to be able to get their children in the school. They would like to have it in at least the seven years. And we've got over 20 children that are coming right downstream that would want to go into the school. We don't we can't put them in the school. We have absolutely no room to put them in the school. With the extra space, we might be able to get another portable or two, but the feeling of the trustees is that it would be just an expensive band-aid and it really wouldn't do a whole lot for us. So, we may have to be looking for uh seriously for another location. And you say, "Well, we've got I got a little space beside me this morning." I tell you, we had the Lord's table foot washing and then the people coming in for that. We couldn't hardly move in here. And you sisters and the brothers just couldn't hardly move. And and just the congregation itself just through its natural uh increase is is just uh very very substantial. So you would you make that a special matter of prayer, please. Everything that we are engaged in is really quite uh where we're really cramped for space right now. And we just opened up in here. The brothers have been working there for several months. And I'll just tell you that was a major task. It wasn't just we had to get new engineering from the city of Suriri and they required that we actually replace the roof structures and the joist, the floor joist and have them as engineered beams. Every joist had to be an engineered beam. And the brothers are brother Gordy Russell. I want to on behalf of the congregation say thank you brother Gordy. He just assumed such a tremendous responsibility. and Michael Ray, brother Michael Ray, Brother Chris Merittz, and many other brothers. But these brothers have taken a incredible amount of work. If you saw the wires that Brother Chris Meritz along with uh Brother Michael strung trays of wires because they have to wire in for the equipment room for all the video work and the translators will be up there area I think for about four translators. We've added about 700 square ft, but it was a mammoth mammoth task. And that's what we call an expensive band-aid. Uh when it's finished, we're going to make it possible so all the congregation be free to, you know, go up there and see it and and visit the brothers. I have a incidentally, Brother Tony and Sister Rebecca are in Iran right now. I have a picture of them. Could uh can we show that picture? Brother Tony even has a bit of a beard. He I don't know. They might They fit in, don't they? He said, "Uh, we're having a nice time. Things are very different. We have met some nice friends and uh couldn't say much more." That's all he said. having a nice time. We've met some good friends and so on. They they just came to Iran from Kuwait. They were in Kuwait and then they'll be making their way home. So, I'm sure you'll hear much more when we get here. Would you remember to pray for them, please? All right. Would you stand? And I'd like to have you turn in 1 Coronicles, please, to uh the 16th chapter. Nice to see our brother Brad Johnson. I know that he was welcomed officially, but I tell you what, we've we have a longstanding friendship there. Brother Brad and his wife, Sister Molly. Sister Molly didn't come with you, Brother Brad. All right. Well, we'll forgive you. I guess you greet her for us. In the 16th chapter of Chronicles, we're going to read [cough and clears throat] starting with verse 11. Seek the Lord and his strength. Seek his face continually. Remember his marvelous works that he hath done. His wondrous his wonders and the judgments of his mouth. Oh ye seed of Israel, his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. He is the Lord our God. His judgments are in all the earth. Be mindful always of his covenant, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations, even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac, and hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant, saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan the lot of your inheritance, when ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it. And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people, he suffered no man to do them wrong. Yay, he reproved kings for their sakes, saying, "Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. Sing unto the Lord, all the earth, and show forth from day to day his salvation. Declare his glory among the heathen, his marvelous works among all nations. For great is the Lord and greatly to be praised. He also is to be feared above all gods. And I am reading also from John the 10th chapter vers 30 and 31. Perhaps I'll just back up and read verse 27. My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish. Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. How's that for a covenant? &gt;&gt; My father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand. &gt;&gt; I and my father are one. Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. Amazing, isn't it? Let's ask the Lord to give us a special understanding of this scripture. Almighty God, giver of every good gift. You're the father of lights. All light comes from you. I pray that you'll banish any darkness or cloud, any fog that may be upon our minds. Give us clarity of the Holy Spirit, clarity of understanding, clarity of speech this morning. I pray God, I pray you'll give understanding to the people. May the Holy Spirit be upon us. Lord, we do not want to lean upon the arm of flesh or upon the arm of just human ability. Lord, we have nothing to do with that. We want to deny that just now for we declare we are dependent upon you. Entirely dependent. Move upon us, oh God. Have your free course in the service, Lord. Have your free course, I pray. And Lord Jesus, we are interested that your name will be glorified and lifted up. The name that's above every name, those that might be needy here, yet we have prayed, Lord. But we are continuously in need, Lord. And we have some even this morning that have special needs. I pray that you'll reach out and meet that need, oh God. Touch them with a divine touch. And may their faith rise beyond the emotions or rise beyond just the natural mental powers. May their faith rise oh God in that sixth sense that dimension Lord that is beyond this natural elements and lay hold of the promise of God the covenant which you've made in Jesus Christ's name. We're so dependent upon you now. We pray that you will grace this entire day in the service tonight. And our brother Lance will minister, oh God. I pray that you will grace this entire day with your presence. And we will declare without shame, we love you, oh God. We love you with all of our heart for what you've done for us and what you are doing. In Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Now the scripture which I just closed with, Jesus said, "I and my father are one and then the Jews took up stones to stone him." You need to put those two things together. It's amazing. Jesus said many things and of course they took up stones at other times, too. But you need to ask yourself the question, why was it at this moment? Uh, and what was there in this statement that caused this kind of response from the hearers, the people? They were the religious people. They were god-fearing people in their minds. And then they took up stones to stone him. Now the declaration that he made that could not have come at any other time. In other words, when you hear the hear the word then took they up stones to stone him. Then it was at that moment they took up stones because that was the only time Jesus couldn't say that when he was 12 years old even though he was the son of God but the there was a a time when those things could be said. And I want to I want to just take another scripture if you don't mind. Uh if you want to turn to it you can turn to it in Luke's gospel the 4th chapter. And I'd like to just take my time this morning. Uh I believe that I get encouraged by you that I should do that. &gt;&gt; Luke the 4th chapter verse 20. And he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. Now let me just have your attention for a moment. The scripture here earlier says, "And he went to the synagogue." He he went to the synagogue as was his custom. &gt;&gt; In other words, this was not the first time he was doing it. He as was his custom. But now on this occasion, it was different. He that was his custom, he always went to the synagogue. See, that was his custom. A custom is something you do again and again and again. It's a part of your life. And now, but on this occasion as was his custom. But now, there came a different time, a different moment in time. And the book of Isaiah was delivered to him. And the scroll, we have it in the book, but he has it in the scroll. But he's going through the scroll to find the place. and he's looking for the place and he finds it. The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound. And he only reads half of the next two sentences, only one sentence of it. He splits the verse right in half. to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord. The last part of that same sentence is and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn. But he didn't come to proclaim the day of vengeance of our God at that time. So when he finished reading to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord which is just a comma he stopped and he closed the book the Bible says AND SAID THIS DAY IS THIS scripture fulfilled in your ears. Amen. &gt;&gt; Had he gone on, he wouldn't have been able to say that. But he stopped at precisely. My point is he could only say, "I and my father are one." It came at a precise moment in time when that had to be introduced. That had to be spoken. And it also had to generate that KIND OF A RESPONSE. THEN TOOK the upstones to stone him. in and the seed is not air with the shock. In that message, prophet of God says, "Now it's hard to get in a church for a sponsorship." Now he's talking about this age, this time. Now it's hard. Can you imagine? Isn't this remarkable? &gt;&gt; Think about it. Now here here's a here's a messenger. Brother Brandham in his ministry couldn't beat the people off lined up filling any auditorium filling it to the tens of thousands and overseas and Durban and Johannesburg and Bombay and on and on and hundreds of thousands of people. Now he's saying it's hard to get a church for sponsorship. When they were crying, come and join us. Come and BE WITH US. JUST ADJUST your doctrine a little bit. Two or three small changes. You won't have any problem. You won't have any problem. And he keeps referring to he he's referred to a number of times. And Jesus when he was the young prophet and doing all of the miracles and things, everybody wanted this young prophet. Everybody wanted this this popular move that was happening because it was at a level. They wanted they wanted the miracles. They wanted the signs. They wanted the wanders that were taking place. They just uh that they knew that that would be good for their organization. &gt;&gt; Hard to get sponsorship just as it was with our Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; because it's him. If it he said if it isn't it isn't me it's him it's not me he's saying but as he preached at the first and healed the sick and raised the dead you have to get the picture now brother Brandham's reaching right back into the scripture in the time of Jesus and taking a quantum leap from there to this day and making that absolute perfect comparison because it was the son of man in a body in this day and it was the son of man being revealed in this day. And that's why he's saying, "It's not me. It's him. &gt;&gt; It's still him. It's not me that can't get sponsorship. It's him that can't get sponsorship." &gt;&gt; Isn't that perfect? &gt;&gt; And back here, there was a time when everybody wanted him. Oh, this young prophet. And the and and the Pharisee wanted him for his feast day to have a feast that he would have this popular young prophet there even though he didn't believe his doctrine but he wanted that young prophet Jesus Christ of Nazareth to come and that was him and his revealing back then in a physical revealing and the physical body because the body had to go to Calvary but this time it's the same Christ only in word form and not one iota different. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's hard thing even to get a group of people like this to really comprehend. It's the same Jesus Christ. Not one trace different. Not one trace less in power. Not one. If you can reach through today and touch the hem of his garment, it will be as effective as it was back then. &gt;&gt; His power is present. His presence is here to make himself known to you. And he wants to do it more than we even want to receive it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us not be part of the multitude that just stood by the wayside and watched him and mused mused mentally about him and wondered about him and questioned about him. But let us let us be I hope I can get you persuaded today to release all the elements of the natural life and reach through even beyond your environment here in the congregation today to reach beyond it and actually touch him who is here who is present. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not me. But he was but as he preached at the first at the first and healed the sick and raised the dead and cleansed the lepers and cast out devils. Everybody wanted him. But there come a time where there's a message that always follows the sign. A message always follows the sign because the sign has a voice. And he said if the sign doesn't have a voice, no matter what you hear about, I hear, "Oh, great things are taking place." That is that's fine. I don't deny great things. I don't deny that people even have uh things that I can't explain or supernatural events that are taking place. But you just sit back. Don't get carried away with that. You watch and see if there's a voice that follows that sign. If there's a message and that message will have to agree with this 100%. &gt;&gt; A message that follows that sign he because a sign has a voice. He says but when he sat down one day when he sat down one day and said now brother Brandham has brought a perfect parallel between that day and this day Christ then and Christ now. It wasn't Christ then and his ministry now. It was Christ then and the ministry of Christ now. &gt;&gt; The very ministry you've been called under. &gt;&gt; The very voice that moved you. &gt;&gt; And now he is saying he's saying but when he sat down one day and said I and my father are one. You would have thought that that would have inspired and brought a response out of the people that said, "Oh, OH, HOW GLORIOUS. THIS ONE WHO WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING. THIS ONE WHO WE HAVE so uh uh so been uh gripped and taken by this early ministry. Now he's saying different things. He's saying new things. He's saying I and my father are one." You would have thought they would have said, "Isn't this marvelous that God has raised up one who has been vindicated and proven amongst us and is now able to declare that he that has that God is his father." That was new. Moses didn't say that. You know, Elijah didn't say that. Samuel didn't say that. God God had never been declared by the people of the Old Testament to be their father. They never said, "I'm his son." And that is why they took up stones to stone him. But today, it's a common we're his children. We're sons and we're daughters. And it's a common thing for us. But you understand this was a this was a a remarkable thing to to and and a blasphemy as far as the Jewish people were concerned to make that kind of a declaration. But when he sat down one day and said, "My father and I are one." That was more than they could stand. &gt;&gt; That was more than they could stand that they could take. It was also when he said, "Except you eat my flesh and drink my blood, you have no life in you." He says, "What doctor and well-thinking people would have said, "This man's a human vampire trying to get you to eat his flesh and drink his blood." He never explained it. He just said it. &gt;&gt; And there's things today that have been spoken even in the message and people maybe wrestle with it one way or another. We're not to wrestle with it. It's been spoken. We just leave it &gt;&gt; and believe it. And then he went on to say, "And tonight you might hear things that through the meeting that's just said, we might not be able to explain, but remember Jesus is the same. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever." WHAT'S HE SAYING? IT'S A COMMON PHRASE. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. In other words, he said it back there. They didn't understand it. He'll say it here, and they won't understand it. He said it there and he didn't explain it. He'll say it again and he won't explain it. &gt;&gt; He'll say he said it back then. He expected the people to believe it. People just like you sitting maybe not on seats such as you are, but sitting on the banks listening to him. He said it back there. He expected they'd believe it. He says it today. He expects that we'll believe it. When they believed it back there, they received the supernatural. When we receive it today, we'll receive the supernatural when we believe. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I see you raise your hand, brother Mike Vineyard. God bless you. &gt;&gt; May God answer your prayer. Touch your body and your son. &gt;&gt; Brother Bob, we prayed for him fell 15 or 18 feet. We need the supernatural, friends. And this God that we're talking about, this God, he so yearns and so desires that when today when we hear the same words that we will at least have this uh not just a concept but a revelation that it is the same Jesus Christ. Oh, I can't stress that enough because if we if that if we can absorb that, there's just absolutely nothing that is impossible with God. You believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; With man this is impossible, BUT WITH GOD NOTHING, &gt;&gt; NOTHING. Say the word, nothing shall be impossible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the very ministry that called you at this time was sent at this particular season to make the two one. That's what this ministry is all about. And I've alluded to that and I've made certain statements as we've gone along, but I have felt that I wanted to approach this subject once more. And some of the statements may be repeated, but I believe it's it's it's essential in the message proving his word. And incidentally, I was sitting in that service. Brother Brandham goes into the vision which I was included in. And if you read the read the message, I was the young man in the green checkered shirt. Most of you know that. Maybe visitors here don't know that I was in that vision. That vision took six hours, minimum of six hours to be fulfilled from the beginning to the end. You know, brother Bram talks about going in to pray for a boy or something, pray for someone. And he said, "If in the vision there's a hat on the bed and he goes in and the hat's not there, he can't go and put it there." &gt;&gt; In the vision, I was wearing a green checkered shirt. I that I'd had that shirt for years. It was a green checkered dokin shirt and it had got ripped here a lot of times and my wife just stitched it up with a sewing machine, stitched it up several times. I don't know why it tore there, but it was torn there. And so when I was getting ready to go on this particular hunt, I said to her, "Throw this shirt away and go and get me a new shirt." And I thought red would be a good color. When I lived in the north, I never got red, but now we're going up in the mountains. I thought maybe I should be have red shirt so they can see me long ways off. And being the good wife that she is, she didn't do it. I have to say that. I mean, she had the she was Sarah. She gave the right instruction this time. She was in the vision, I guess. So, she didn't do it. She just swed it up again. As it needs to be, we all got up in the of of the morning. I didn't know there was any special thing to happen. And we get up in the morning and make our way. And I we had to cross a creek. Now, I don't remember that cuz I fell in so many times, I guess. But brother Brandham remembered it real well and I think we were crossing on a log or something and I fell off that log and fell into the water of this creek. I scold incidentally and I had I so I just said to the brothers just wait and I'll run back to the camp cuz we weren't that far. I'll run back and change and change my clothes. And so I ran back, opened up my duffel bag and was going to get into a nice new shirt and looked at open up my duffel bag and here's this old green checkered shirt. I thought she didn't get me a new shirt. So I put on that shirt and now I'm right on my way to fulfill a vision. &gt;&gt; See, I didn't have any idea there was any vision coming on. I didn't have a least clue that 6 hours from now or 6 or 7 hours from now I was going to be standing by the trail as I was supposed to be in the vision. Uh that there was an 18-year-old young fellow that was beside me with not much hair on his hands and was going to spread out his hands for some reason or was going to hear a voice that's 42 inches. I mean I didn't know any none of that was planned. You understand? It just happens. But it happened right at that season and everything had to come together. It was absolutely made to measure. It is. Why? Because it's thus sayeth the Lord and it's an eternal word. And that's why I can speak with such confidence today. And when you read proving his word, it is one of the marvelous most marvelous descriptions he gives of the son of man ministry which was his ministry at this time. Now friends, why did it come at this time? Do you know why? God knew you were going to be here at this time. And he knew that there was something a part of the contract was in you by a predestinated seed that was in you. You were going to be born AND BROUGHT INTO THIS LIFE. YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING IN YOU THAT WAS NOT GOING TO MATCH ANY DENOMINATION. IT WOULDN'T MATCH ANY CLUB. IT WOULDN'T MATCH ANY SOCIETY. IN FACT, IS IT WOULDN'T MATCH EVEN WITHIN THE NATION THAT YOU WERE RAISED UP IN. YOU WOULD GO AROUND SAYING LIKE THE LIKE THE LITTLE eagle in the barnyard, "SOMETHING'S WRONG. I'm eating, BUT IT DOESN'T SATISFY. THIS ISN'T MY DIET FOR SOME REASON. I hear these other voices all around me, but it doesn't make any SENSE TO ME. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS CLOCK CLUCK of this uh of this so-called mother that I have. I don't understand it. And then one day you HEARD A CERTAIN SCREAM. You heard A CERTAIN SOUND. WHAT WAS IT? It was the voice BEHIND THE MESSAGE, BEHIND THE SIGN. YOU HEARD THE SOUND. AND YOU JUST SAID, "OH MY, THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME." In fact is it sounded so good, we said in our mind, "It can't be real. IT CAN'T BE RIGHT. That's too good." But it was precisely God's voice coming to you. It was the other part of the contract that was coming to meet to meet the the half that you had &gt;&gt; last last Wednesday. I took the contract and I tore the covenant in two. And there was a and when I read half of it, you that were here, most of you were when I read half of it, it didn't make any sense. But when you put the two together in that day, Hallelujah. I'll write my law in their hearts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't that marvelous? &gt;&gt; And listen what he says in here. Now he goes back not to even to the time of Jesus but into the time of Abraham who had been promised. And incidentally, I hope maybe I can get time to get back into that covenant that God made with Abraham. But God had already made a covenant with Abraham. Then in Genesis 18, he visits him in the form of Elohim, in the form of a man, &gt;&gt; and he eats he eats meat and drinks milk and there's butter and whatever more that Abraham set before him. He made a feast for him. And I'll just put it the way uh the prophet of God has said it. And remember, he said that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there. He says that could discern the thoughts of Sarah's mind behind him. That was not Jesus. He said he had not yet been born. You understand? He's making a distinction here. But it was a man in human flesh. &gt;&gt; And that Abraham called Elohim. He called him Lord Elohim. the great almighty and Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom. Now he said watch close. And I'll ask this congregation today, watch close. &gt;&gt; This may be the dividing line between some of you that believe and some may be a question. Maybe some can't believe, but I'll say you believe it. &gt;&gt; I admonish you to believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I came to the end of my life tomorrow, I'd want to know that I believed it. &gt;&gt; Even if I hadn't understood it, believe it. &gt;&gt; Even if your mind reasons and you have difficulty, but believe it and ask God to help you believe it even more than you may have before you came to the meeting. And Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Sodom, now watch close. in the days of Sodom. So it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. It will be the same when the Son of Man is being revealed. When he's being revealed, not no more as a church. Not no more. He said, "The bride's called. In that day, the Son of Man will be revealed." Notice how what he's stressing. He said, now he asked the question, "What the Son of Man is being revealed?" There's a certain season in time when the conditions of Sodom and Gomorrah are everywhere and the days of Noah have repeated themselves globally when that season arrives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it has arrived. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S SAYING IN THAT day &gt;&gt; that's why I started out today saying when Jesus said I and my father are one then they took up stones to stone him. couldn't happen earlier, but now the time had arrived. And he went into the synagogue as was his custom. And he stood up for to read. It's the only time it's quoted in his entire life that he stood up in the synagogue to read. And a priest handed him the scroll. And he opened up the book. And you know, the same thing repeated in this time. Brother Brandham stood up for to read &gt;&gt; in birth painans. and he opened the book and couldn't open the pages were stuck TOGETHER AND HE THOUGHT THERE HAD BEEN A MISPRINT AND THE BIBLE had just been given to him by his wife and a priest stood up. Priest Bishop Stanley stood up and came beside him and handed him his Bible &gt;&gt; and he and he and he and he he read the scripture out of the priest's Bible. The same repeat, the same thing happening. Oh my, there's so many things. Are you able to follow me? &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And the same thing is repeating when you see these conditions globally. Then he said it will be that day. Now I know this may be elementary to a lot of people but a lot of it needs to be said again needs to be referred to again. And perhaps you've heard it many times and it'll just clinch. It'll come with a whole new force to you. And in that day the son of man will be revealed. And he says what? In other words, what for? He answers it to join the church to the head. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is it? IT'S THE CATALYST. &gt;&gt; HE'S SAYING the catalyst &gt;&gt; THAT UH THAT ELEMENT &gt;&gt; HAS now arrived. &gt;&gt; THAT SPECIAL THING THAT GOD SENT THAT WILL UNITE THE TWO TOGETHER, &gt;&gt; THE HEAD AND THE BODY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND IF IT CAME AT THAT SEASON, THAT MEANS THAT IT WASN'T CONNECTED WITH THAT KIND OF A UNION BEFORE. &gt;&gt; It was moving up to it, but it hadn't come to that place to join the church to the head, unite the marriage of the bride. &gt;&gt; Then he goes on, continues on, the bridegroom, the bridegroom call will come right through this. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you are here this morning and maybe you've been moved say, "Oh, I was moved by a time when brother Lance preached and it moved me. Brother John Andy's preached, Brother Tony, Brother Tom, Brother Ernie or Brother Bisll, you preached and I was so affected and my understanding was open. THE HOLY SPIRIT CAME ON ME. I WAS DELIVERED." &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHATEVER IT WAS THAT HAPPENED. But I will tell you, it was none of those brothers. It was the bridegroom call. I WAS LISTENING TO A TAPE. I HEARD A PROPHET PREACH. OH, I HAD HEARD IT MANY TIMES. BUT NOW IT CAME WITH A NEW FORCE. IT WASN'T WILLIAM BRANDOM. IT WAS THE BRIDEGROOM CALL. And it could only come in this season. But I am here declaring over the last three services and now number four. THIS PARTICULAR ELEMENT could not be at any other time in the history of mankind. It had TO COME AT THIS HOUR FOR ONE PURPOSE TO UNITE. &gt;&gt; IT IS THE FORCE TO UNITE. IT'S A CATALYST THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO UNITE THE ELEMENTS TOGETHER into one. And once that element which is the Holy Spirit has bonded the two together, it is inseparable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to God. There's no way to part it. I have had an experience you know when you break especially some China that's one thing that why China becomes valuable is kind of because China breaks China chips you know loses its value some of its value you can find some very very valuable pieces you know from Dresden and Germany they make beautiful china And uh in uh in England they've just made beautiful China in France. Made some beautiful China. But the reason why China becomes real valuable is because it breaks over the over the years and it's gone from history disappears and there's always less and less of it. It's a depleting uh uh a depleting commodity. So you always try and I've had the experience I I go to a store and say have you got something that will put these two together and that is one of the hardest things to get. I have had experience I've gone and talked to people say I need to glue two things together or they've come up with new products. They said you put this in there that thing will break but it won't break right here. won't break on this same this will glue this thing together and it makes the two so strong. This weld is so strong. This substance is so strong. But you have a tube of this and you have a tube of this. This is one substance but this is a catalyst. You've got to have this and you mix them together and I tell you what, you don't have much time. Once that catalyst gets in there, you don't have much time. I tell you what, in this hour, we don't have a whole lot of time. It's all just come converging, crashing in at the one moment in time. And this is this is the moment where the cattle has come. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said this, the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was what was operating. But you hear you hear it on the tape. You can see it on the on that brief video. And incidentally, I [clears throat] saw two men that are very much given over to the first part of the ministry. There's a video and I think that's the one that was shown over the uh the television in in Israel. And uh because they had they had William Brandom up there and they had AA Allen and they had Jack Cole, the three of them, and they had a little clip from each of their ministries. They had AA Allen casting out a demon of cancer and they had Jack Cole praying for another woman. Brother Bram talks about Jack Cole. He talks about AA Allen didn't one moment deny the mighty works that were happen. We wouldn't belittle them at all. Have no comment on it whatsoever. God does what he does and he allows what he allows. But the thing is he says if that sign doesn't have a voice coming behind it. Oh, I'm glad that we're not just left and say, "Well, I saw a man cast out a devil or I saw a man pray for somebody and they were healed." I can't explain how they were healed. That's not up to us to explain. But when we say, "I saw some marvelous things." That's fine. But I would sooner hear someone say, "I heard a voice." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AND IT MADE THIS BOOK LIVE. AND THERE WERE THINGS I COULDN'T GRASP, THINGS I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND. AND MY MIND WAS FILLED WITH DARKNESS and confusion. And how I yearned, how I yearned for light and life. And then one day I heard a sound. One day I heard a voice AND JUST ONE WORD AND IT CLEARED IT ALL AWAY. LISTEN, I heard four I heard four scriptures brought to me out of the prophet's mouth. And in those four scriptures, I've used the term a thousand questions evaporated out of my mind. I mean, I lived for years in in in a uh not in a confusion as such, but I I was confused about where did this brother stand, where did that man, where did this minister stand? And I saw their lives and I saw their anointing and heard them speak in tongues and all kinds of miraculous things and declarations. But one day, and this one believed one thing, that one believed another thing. of that. How can this be young man looking looking for something solid, looking for something that would uh you know answer these questions and sit now with another man, a prophet of God, and reach into the same scripture. All four verses that he referred me to, I knew them well. And he even left a line a a word out. In the last days seth God I'll pour my spirit upon. I said all. He said right. A ll all flesh. But not all flesh is saved. &gt;&gt; A drunk can feel the spirit of God. A prostitute could feel the spirit of God. It doesn't mean anything unless she believes it &gt;&gt; OR HE BELIEVES IT for the transformation of the soul. The word has to reach the soul. I hope it's getting down to you friends. And he says, "And he'll come in human flesh." He'll come in human flesh. Just thank God through all OF THESE CENTURIES. HASN'T DONE IT, FRIENDS, children of 2004. He didn't do it a 100 years ago. He did IT IN YOUR DAY. &gt;&gt; HE DID IT IN YOUR SEASON. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD THE BRIDEGROOM IN NOW another capacity IN A BRIDEGROOM CAPACITY OPERATING THROUGH A HUMAN VESSEL. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS WHY? TO UNITE &gt;&gt; THE TWO TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Then then back there they took up stones to stone them. &gt;&gt; But back then there were a lot that didn't take up stones to stone them. They just sat and listened. That's nice. There's a marvelous, marvelous things he sang. Don't be in that crowd either. Don't be in that crowd. Well, that's nice. This man Jesus, he has got some real energetic people. He's got Peter. Oh my goodness, Peter. He just gets all enthused. I heard great things about Peter. Stepped out on the water and did all of these things. And he's got he's got James, a prayer warrior, and John. Oh, and and then there's all these others. And there's, you know, they're following him some women. He's got some enthused ministers today, too, &gt;&gt; who've been gripped. I tell you what, I don't preach the way I'm preaching at my age here today because I want a certain kind of friendship or certain kind of association or certain kind of name or a certain kind of living. That's not it. I tell you what, in just a second, if I could get free of it, I would. But I am compelled as long as I have breath, as long as I have energy, as long as I have competence of mind and a mental retention AND ABILITY TO STIR UP THE GIFT THAT'S IN THE PEOPLE. CAUSE THEM TO BELIEVE. PERSUADE THEM TO BELIEVE. PERSUADE THEM TO AGREE WITH THIS WORD OF GOD. WHY DID THIS COME? WHY WAS HE REVEALED TO ME? TO UNITE ME AND MAKE ME ONE. &gt;&gt; NOT TWO, BUT ONE. HALLELUJAH. SHIELDED &gt;&gt; BY THE spirit of God, &gt;&gt; by this prophet catalyst. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To make the two one to unite the two together, the church has to be the word. He is the word and the two unites together. And to do that, &gt;&gt; TO DO THAT, it will take &gt;&gt; Amen. IT WILL TAKE THE MANIFESTATION OF THE REVEALING of the SON OF MAN. SEE HOW HE GOES OVER IT AND GOES OVER IT AND GOES OVER IT. NOW, in the little bit that I read you, he's come to that very POINT THREE TIMES in this paragraph. &gt;&gt; And I would say to you that is a very very significant thing. You know it's he said see I'll come back to my thought it's this it's son of man Jesus Christ will come down now he I'm not repeating it he's repeating it I'm going on in the same paragraph now we're coming to the fourth time it's the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And will make the word so real. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Make it so real &gt;&gt; that it'll unite the church and him AS ONE, the bride, AND THEN SHE'LL GO HOME TO THE WEDDING SUPPER. I WILL SAY WITHOUT THAT UNITING, IT WILL BE NO GOING HOME TO THE WEDDING SUPPER. &gt;&gt; This is not some option. THIS ISN'T AN OPTION. SAY, "WELL, that's nice. I think, you know, it'd be nice if I COULD BELIEVE LIKE THAT." YOU NEED TO BELIEVE like that. YOU NEED TO SAY, "OH, GOD, MOVE ALL THE OBSTACLES OUT OF THE WAY. MOVE all the hindrances out of the way. MOVE EVERYTHING, EVERY QUESTION OUT OF MY MIND, or if I haven't even received it to this level yet, let me COME TO THAT DEGREE WHERE I CAN MAKE THAT uh I can make that discernment." It was God, the bridegroom, IN HUMAN FLESH, OPERATING THROUGH A VESSEL. AND THAT ELEMENT HAD TO COME TO MAKE THE WORD SO REAL THAT I COULD NOT DENY IT. AND I HEARD IT. IT WASN'T MERELY ANOINTED, BUT it was the word of God. It was anointed to me. And it was so real. &gt;&gt; Now I hear from a minister's mouth. The purpose was to take and unite me, make me one unit. &gt;&gt; My guarantee I'll sit at the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; Then she'll go home to the wedding supper. He said, "Amen. She's already united." &gt;&gt; And we go to the wedding supper, not to the marriage. She's already united. She's already united. In my message today, I'm saying it could not happen a 100 years ago. Your forefathers may have been wonderful people. And I'll tell you, there's great people that have lived in the past. They didn't have this privilege. They looked for it. They looked for it. They could see it in the word of God. They looked for it, but it didn't come. Now, I'd like you to notice the ministry of Elijah. The Elijah spirit that was anointed that anointed John the Baptist. At the birth of John, his father, Zachcharias, was filled, the Bible says, with the Holy Ghost. He's filled with the Holy Ghost. And he prophesied saying uh concerning the ministry of John and this is what he said. And his father Zachcharias was filled with the Holy Ghost and prophesied saying, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he hath visited and redeemed his people. He hath raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David, as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which which have been since the world began, that we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us, to perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant. This was the ministry of the spirit of Elijah to remember or bring back to remembrance or to restore to the people their to their consciousness the covenant which God made. &gt;&gt; A covenant's often made up of many promises, not just one, but many promises. And then there can be a whole series of promises. And then God declared as he did to Abraham. And I brought it Wednesday night. He declared to Abraham. He said, "I'm going to give you a son and your seed is going to inherit this land." And he went on and made a number of promises. And then at the end of the experience of dividing the animals and so on, he said, "And this was the covenant that he made. This is my covenant between you." Now, the covenant involved all the promises that he made to him. The word covenant, it's a it's a pledge. It's an agreement. And God made an unconditional covenant that went all the way back to Eden when he prophesied of the coming of Jesus Christ and that he would bruise the serpent's head. He speaks of that and the quote I made here after Adam and Eve sinned and God said depart out of my presence. He couldn't stand it. So I can see Adam starting to walk away. Then he said, I could hear those sheep skins, bloody sheep skins flopping against his legs. He's going out. And I can see God who covers all space and time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who has no beginning or ending. I can see it all bottling down like a funnel coming down like this for one little four-letter word. L O V E. love. Actually, before I spoke that on Wednesday, before I referred to this, I woke I wasn't even awake yet in the wee hours of the morning, sometime in the middle of the night, I guess. And I I I just had an experience that I was speaking this to you and I I I saw myself raising my hands and just bringing it down. I said in into one funnel, just a funnel. We were we were command We were separated from God. But now this God just came down into a funnel. L O V E. Love. &gt;&gt; Oh, how grateful I am to God that he did not leave us separated and cast off. You know friends, and I hope you take this correct. I travel a lot. I travel more than perhaps I want to travel and more than you want me to travel. But it has been my sad experience and those others of the ministers of this church that have traveled. And this is when I'm done saying what I'm going to say. I want to preface that by saying this that it is that is the reason we're so compelled to try to hue to the line. Try to live according to the word of God. Because as I have traveled been in a lot of churches and I don't know why and I see and observe in the people that the life of this word they're missing they're missing the preciousness of it. They're missing the strength of it and they're unsettled in their lives. And you see you see distress and you see questions and and what brings such an agony a agony to me I say they've got access to it. &gt;&gt; It is right here before them. Why are they living so far below their standard? Why isn't the man of God declaring the full strength of the word? Why isn't he telling them this son of man that has been manifested to you HAS COME IN A SPECIAL WAY to make THE WORD SO REAL? THAT IT WILL COMPEL YOU, IT WILL DRAW YOU, IT WILL ACCELERATE, &gt;&gt; THE ONENESS, THE UNITY, THE COMING TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; And then you see people, you see them last year, you see them five years ago and they're walking, walking with this reality, with this faith. They're walking in the light of the word. AND GOOD TIMES COME, BAD TIMES COME, ALL KINDS OF THINGS COME. BUT YOU SEE THEM YEARS LATER AND THEY'RE THE SAME AND YEARS LATER AND THEY'RE THE SAME. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS. IT'S NOT THEM. IT'S NOT THEIR GOOD LIFE. IT'S NOT THEIR STRENGTH. IT'S NOT THAT. IT'S THE SEAL THAT'S HOLDING. &gt;&gt; IT'S THAT THAT'S BEEN MADE REAL TO THEM THAT'S HOLDING. and where where that uh uh uh substance which is the revelation of the of the son OF MAN OF JESUS CHRIST. I TELL you what, once the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit, YOU KNOW, BEFORE BEFORE PENTECOST, THEY TOOK UP STONES TO STONE JESUS. BUT THE DISCIPLES WERE STANDING THERE, THEY DIDN'T TAKE UP stones to stone them. &gt;&gt; They didn't WANT TO CAST THEM IN PRISON. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO CRUCIFY THEM BECAUSE THE THE ONENESS HADN'T come yet. &gt;&gt; BUT ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST IN ACTS 2, &gt;&gt; WHEN THE WHEN THE TIME OF PENTECOST HAD FULLY COME, &gt;&gt; IT COULDN'T HAPPEN 30 YEARS BEFORE THAT, BUT AT THAT TIME AND WHEN THE DAY OF PENTECOST WAS FULLY COME, THERE CAME A SOUND FROM HEAVEN AS A RUSHING MIGHTY WIND. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE RIGHT PLACE. It was Jerusalem. IT WAS THE RIGHT PEOPLE WHO HAD BELIEVED his word. THEY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT, BUT THEY BELIEVED IT. OH, FRIENDS, ARE YOU HEARING ME? THOSE PEOPLE HAD TO BE BORN. THEY HAD TO LIVE. AND THERE WAS WOMEN and men THAT WERE IN THAT GROUP. THEY HAD TO BE THERE. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE ORDAINED OF GOD TO BE THERE. AND A RUSHING MIGHTY SOUND FROM HEAVEN CAME. AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE, THE PROPHET SAID, DIVIDED ITSELF UP. THE WORD OF GOD DIVIDED ITSELF UP. AND THERE WAS ON EACH OF THEM licks of fire, CLOVEN TONGUES OF FIRE. AND BROTHER BANNER MAKES A POWERFUL STATEMENT. HE SAID, GOD, HE HAD DIVIDED HIMSELF. UH HE HAD HE HAD DIVIDED HIMSELF. THE PILLAR OF FIRE NOW WAS MANY LITTLE FLAMES. AND HE AND HE MAKES A COMMENT. THIS isn't verbatim NOW, BUT HE SAID WHAT WAS HE DOING? HE WAS he was bringing himself together. THAT HAD TO HAPPEN BECAUSE PART OF THE WORD WAS IN you and in you and in you and in you and in you and in you. AND SO THE PILLAR OF FIRE DIVIDED ITSELF TOGETHER AND IDENTIFIED THAT EACH OF THOSE HAD THE WORD IN THEM. AND BY THAT HOLY SPIRIT COMING, IT BROUGHT THE WHOLE UNIT TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT COULD ONLY HAPPEN AT THAT TIME. &gt;&gt; AND I SAY AGAIN, AND THIS THAT YOU ARE HEARING CAN ONLY HAPPEN AT THIS TIME. &gt;&gt; We are ridiculed. We are spoken evil of by people. We're called A CULT OF THE DEVIL OF whatever more of heretics. WE'RE WORSHIPING SOME DEAD MAN. I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT PROPHET OF GOD IS DEAD. &gt;&gt; I'd like TO KNOW WHAT SAINT OF GOD IS DEAD. HALLELUJAH. JESUS SAID, "IF YOU BELIEVE IN ME, YOU SHALL NEVER DIE." &gt;&gt; THERE'S PREACHERS WITHIN JUST BLOCKS OF HERE. PREACHERS WITHIN A FEW BLOCKS OF HERE TRYING TO SAY THAT WORSHIPING SOME DEAD MAN. WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT OF SOME CATHOLIC FAITH worshiping some dead people. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WE'RE IN FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LIVING GOD. &gt;&gt; AND WE BELIEVE THE SCRIPTURE, HE THAT BELIEVETH ON ME SHALL NEVER DIE. BELIEVEST THOU THIS? &gt;&gt; OH, Martha says, "IN THE END TIME, I KNOW HE'LL RISE IN THE RESURRECTION." HE SAID, "I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE." THIS SON OF MAN WHO VISIT HIMSELF HERE NOW AND WILL ACCOMPANY THIS WORD AS LONG AS IT'S PREACHED. HE IS THE RESURRECTION. &gt;&gt; As I've said many times before, we're not going to a resurrection. Those that are ASLEEP IN CHRIST, THEY ARE THE RESURRECTION. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT GOING TO A RAPTURE. WE ARE THE RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; And when the day OF NOT OF PENTECOST IS FULLY COME, BUT WHEN THE DAY OF THE RAPTURE IS FULLY COME, I CAN TELL YOU ALL OF THESE INDIVIDUAL PIECES WILL UNITE TOGETHER FOR THAT GREAT GATHERING MOMENT. AND WE'LL be there &gt;&gt; together. &gt;&gt; It's going to be more real than it is right this moment. &gt;&gt; And I know I I just know myself. I'm going to be looking for you. I'm be looking. Say, I walked with them in life. We walked together. We labored. We prayed together. We washed feet together. We had communion together. Where are they? Oh, there they are. Oh, there they are. You talk about a rejoicing. YOU TALK ABOUT A REJOICING. YOU WON'T BE SITTING QUIET AS YOU ARE THIS MORNING. YOU'LL SAY, "I MADE IT. I MADE IT. I MADE IT. HALLELUJAH. I MADE IT. OH, GLORY TO GOD. NO MORE TEMPTATION. NO MORE STRANGE THOUGHTS. IT'LL ALL BE GONE. WHY? BECAUSE YOU HEARD THE WORD &gt;&gt; AND YOU WERE UNITED TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; OH, you think this kind of preaching is a little uh uh, you know, too demonstrative? I SEE THESE IDIOTS AT THE BALL GAME. WITH A LITTLE IF I WAS HERE TRYING TO GET YOU EXCITED OVER A LITTLE PIG SKIN OR A LITTLE HARD RUBBER PUCK AND SEE THEM BEAT THEIR FEET AND JUMP ON THEIR HATS AND DO ALL KINDS OF CRAZY THINGS AND GET IN FIGHTS AND SLAM ONE ANOTHER. OH, the people look at that, they think that's normal. &gt;&gt; I think it's crazy. I think it's insane. BUT TO GET EXCITED OVER THIS GLORIOUS THING AND TO THINK WE HAVE INHERITED ETERNAL LIFE. NOT WE SHALL. WE HAVE &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS AN UNCONDITIONAL covenant &gt;&gt; that sister Margaret SANG ABOUT UNCONDITIONAL AND BROTHER BRANDHAM TIES ANOTHER WORD TO UNCONDITIONAL. IF IT'S UNCONDITIONAL IT'S ETERNAL. IT'S ETERNAL BECAUSE UNCONDITIONAL HAS NO END. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BREAK IT. IT'S UNCONDITIONAL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; UNCONDITIONAL. NOT IF YOU DO. HE SAID I HAVE. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BANNER MAKES ANOTHER STATEMENT. HE SAID IT'S NOT EVEN I WILL. &gt;&gt; LOTS OF TIMES God says I WILL DO THIS AND I WILL DO THAT AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE LAND AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE son and I'll do all of these things. BUT IN THIS CASE, HE SAYS, "I HAVE ALREADY DONE IT. &gt;&gt; It's finished. &gt;&gt; It's not if you measure up to a certain standard, he's already done it. &gt;&gt; It's finished." Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell you what, there isn't a person, not on the face of the earth out of five or six billion people that were here when God sent the his prophet messenger at this time, there wasn't one that had put in their order and said, "Oh, God, send Elijah." And if they did, they probably didn't even know what they were speaking of. But he sent him &gt;&gt; because God said he will do it. And his first part of his covenant, he said he made a conditional covenant with Adam. Said if you do this, I'll do that. If you eat of this tree, you'll die. Went on. It was a conditional contract covenant. But now he talking to the serpent. He said, "I'm going to put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed, AND HIS SEED SHALL, UNCONDITIONAL COVENANT SHALL BRUISE YOUR HEAD." &gt;&gt; That's a part of the covenant you want to repeat. That's a part of the covenant THAT YOU WANT TO EXPRESS ON A REGULAR BASIS. AH, THE PART OF THE COVENANT IN ME IS THAT THIS SERPENT, THIS SATAN'S HEAD IS BRUISED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; My goodness, time's gone. I haven't even started here. &gt;&gt; God's covenant with Abraham made up of many promises. Where's my son? God said, "Out of your own lines, he's going to come." You're going to bring a son out of your own lines, and that'll be your heir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look up to heaven and see the stars. See if you can count them. That's how your seed's going to be. And he believes God made a statement and it was counted to him for righteousness. Now I'm going TO GIVE YOU THIS LAND ALSO. I give you this land. Going to give you a seed. Not just a seed. Out of your own loins. And I'm going to give him this land. And in the same day, Abram said, "Well, how am I going to know that this is going to happen?" You know, I believe there's a lesson here for us because often we we hear it and we believe it because the Bible said pre previously he believed God and it was it was counted to him for righteousness. He believed it. But he said, "How will I know?" And so God was going to confirm the covenant to him and so that he knew. Now he said, "How will I know?" In other words, catch this please. How will I be irrevocably convinced so it can never never escape me again? How how will that be? How? He said, "Take these animals. Take a heer and a she goat and a ram and a turtle dove and a pigeon, the birds." Now, God didn't tell him to divide them, but he had asked, "Now, how will I know? I want a covenant to happen here. And so Abraham himself now, he took the animals. He divided them, cut them up. He spread them out, laid them there. He didn't go off someplace else and have a rest in his tent. He stood there with them because he knew this was covenant making. AND THE TWO PEOPLE MAKING THE COVENANT HAVE TO STAND OVER THE PIECES OF THE DEAD ANIMAL BECAUSE THIS IS THE COVENANT. And he he had heard it now THE COVENANT. NOW HE'S STANDING OVER THE PIECES. HE THAT WAS ALL HE COULD DO. But he was not the dark horror of darkness that came. That was God's part. Now God, Abraham did what he could do towards the covenant. Now God is showing him the rest. And the horror of darkness came. We didn't know what it was till a prophet come and said it was hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hell, a horror of darkness. And in the midst of the darkness, a little light moving. &gt;&gt; OH, THANK GOD. EVEN IN THE MOST CRITICAL MOMENT, THERE CAME THAT LITTLE LIGHT BECAUSE THAT LIGHT WAS PART OF THE COVENANT, that sacred light moving through the pieces. And God testified to him, and this is the covenant that I make with you. This what's going to happen to your seed. They're going to go and be in bondage, etc., etc., but I'm going to deliver them. And so God writes his covenant and he was showing you know this well but carry on with me a moment. He was showing him Calvary and at Calvary. Now notice here was this unit called Jesus Christ of Nazareth the son of God. Now he was just going to go into different different elements. He was now just going to part and the blood was going to go one direction and the spirit was going to go another direction. The spirit would rise to GOD BECAUSE IT COULD NOT BE SEPARATED from God. BUT THE BODY WENT TO THE tomb and the blood went to the earth. And they WERE ALL MAKING A STATEMENT. The earth is mine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AND THE FULLNESS THEREOF. AND SATAN, YOU HAVE YOU HAVE GOTTEN IT BY A FRAUD. BUT I'M TAKING IT BACK. &gt;&gt; I'M SPILLING THIS RIGHTEOUS BLOOD at creation OF ALMIGHTY GOD ON THIS EARTH AND I'M CLAIMING IT BACK. And even though there'd be multitudes hearing just today, I thought how sad it was here in the poor country of Iraq and the United States training up special forces and special police of the Iraqi army and the insurgents and the rebels who are causing so much DISTRESS AND TROUBLE. YOU THINK of and and and they they came in and seized a a police office and took the contents of the office. 21 officers took them. That just happened. 21 officers took these police, TOOK THEM OUT, AND SHOT EVERY ONE OF THEM. OH, I'm not I'm not saying that to be sensational. That happened in the real world. That happened just very close to where brother Tony and Sister Rebecca are. And when I heard that and I thought about it today, I thought we've got some police officers in our church. We got some men in special forces and so on. Some mothers without a son. Some wife is without a husband. &gt;&gt; They've been stripped of the very love of their life. Some children today, &gt;&gt; right now &gt;&gt; whose HEARTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY EMPTIED OUT, &gt;&gt; BECAUSE DADDY WON'T come home again. &gt;&gt; He's gone. The own countrymen TOOK THEIR LIFE. 21. JUST BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. And they're gone. Wiped off. I thought they've been stripped of everything that is precious to them. You children, you young people, what would you do if you had to wake UP AND HEAR SUCH A CATASTROPHIC THING, SUCH A HORRIFIC THING HAS happened in my country to my father. These separations that I was talking about two Wednesdays ago, they're severe, they're bitter, and they're terrible. But I tell you one, there's one separation you and I cannot afford. &gt;&gt; And that's why I'm preaching today. We cannot come up before him and find and hear THESE WORDS. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO HEAR THESE WORDS. Depart &gt;&gt; from me. &gt;&gt; You workers of iniquity. AND THE PROPHET SAID, "INIQUITY, IT'S NOT SOME PROSTITUTION LIFE OUT THERE OR SOME DRUNKENNESS OR RIVALRY. IT IS THEY HEARD THE TRUTH AND KNEW THE TRUTH AND REFUSED TO DO IT. &gt;&gt; INIQUITY. &gt;&gt; WE CANNOT HEAR THAT. Depart from me. Oh, that's something that's constantly in my mind. That's why we preach with the fervor that we do. That's why we pull with everything that's in us. You young men and young women that have the pull OF THE WORLD, REMEMBER JESUS SAID HE'S A THIEF. &gt;&gt; AND HE WANTS TO ROB FROM YOU YOUR YOUTH. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO ROB FROM YOU YOUR PURITY. HE WANTS TO DRAG YOU DOWN INTO THE MUD. HE WANTS TO ROB from the homes the the BLESSEDNESS OF THE ONENESS AND THE BEAUTY AND THE PURITY AND THE HOLINESS AND THE LOVE. HE WANTS TO TAKE LOVE FROM THE HOME. HE WANTS TO TAKE THE RESPECT OUT OF THE HEARTS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE OR THE WIFE FOR THE HUSBAND OR THE HUSBAND FOR THE WIFE. HE'S A ROBBER. &gt;&gt; BUT LET THIS CHURCH STAND UP AND RISE SAY WE DENY HIM THAT PRIVILEGE. &gt;&gt; I DENY HIM THAT. &gt;&gt; I STAND HERE UPON THE WORD OF GOD, UPON THE IRREVOCABLE COVENANT OF ALMIGHTY GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; This word STANDS FIRM &gt;&gt; AND I STAND FIRM ON THIS WORD AND I DON'T CARE. THIS GENERATION IS SO PERVERTED AND SO TWISTED AND IT HAS SO SEVERED AND DISMEMBERED UNTIL we become accustomed to it. Don't ever become accustomed to it. Don't ever let that thing get in your heart. You measured by the word of God. And the prophet said when God could come down and talk with them lift to ear, they were in harmony. In harmony, he said that is oneness. And I know these things are hard to say because of the generation we're in, but I'm going to say it anyway. &gt;&gt; There should be harmony between husbands and wives. There should be harmony between children and parents. &gt;&gt; There should be harmony between brother and brother and sister and sister and brothers and sisters and sisters and brothers. There should be harmony and THAT KIND OF A CHURCH WILL BE A CHURCH OF INCREDIBLE POWER. &gt;&gt; INCREDIBLE UNSPEAKABLE POWER. AND THEY'LL UNITE TOGETHER AND THEY WILL PRAY. GOD WILL ANSWER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It may sound like a dream to you. It must not be a dream. That is the truth of God's word. &gt;&gt; Let's live by every word of God. Oh, there's just so much, friend. Just so much. I've been so consumed with this whole subject and I must I must close because time is slipping away on us. But there were so many parts. But I think I've conveyed to you the critical parts of this this word that you've been called under. This is not a message of as such that has been initiated by Cloverdale Bible Way. This is the one thing that Gerson Solomon, he was really uh I would say not bothered but it was trouble. He wanted to get the question answered. want to know where did this thing start? Where did this thing start? He says, "I hear about you people all over the world." He said, "I hear from about you from Africa and from Europe." He said, "Up in Scandinavia." He said, "People contact me." And I said, "Well, who are you?" Well, he said, "Well, you know, Brother Bisco, you know, yes, yes, yes." And Cloverdale Bible said, "We're the same." And he's just hearing that all over. We're the same. We're the same. We're the same. He says, "Where did you start?" He said to me, "Are you the founder?" I said, "Oh, no. I'm not the founder." But he said, "You must be, you know, the main person." I said, "No, no, no. You got it all wrong." And I said, "You've heard me talk to you about Brother Brandom." Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I said, "That's where this really started. That's where this began. This was something that God done." I'm so glad, friends, I can say to you, then then will the son of man be revealed. &gt;&gt; What would you and I do today if we had to go out and face the world that we're in? &gt;&gt; And I don't want you to think that I'm a negative person, but I I walk out, I walk the streets, I walk through the community, I drive, I have contact with a lot of people, and on a regular basis, I say th this is an insane institution. I am walking through an insane institution. I want to say something to you. I've been in the insane institutions many times and they weren't as bad as what I face on the streets. &gt;&gt; I've never had anybody tried to stab me or kill me or anything else. But on the streets, you don't know what's going to happen. &gt;&gt; The worst I saw an insane institution. They want to give a big man an injection. He didn't want the injection and he roared. Almost scared me, but he didn't want that injection. And I didn't blame him. They want to turn him into some kind of zombie. So he just walk around like that. That's the worst I saw. But it's not the worst I saw in the streets on the streets of your town. The people you have to rub shoulders with. You say, "Well, it doesn't look that bad." Just a second. &gt;&gt; If it starts getting that way to you, well, it doesn't look that bad. Don't get used to it. &gt;&gt; Don't get accustomed to it. There's something else you might not understand. God's going to God's going to burn it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's going to burn it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, there's a lot of nice people." That is for sure. Going to be a lot of nice people go to hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. a lot of good a lot of good uh good thinking people and good reasonable people and all the rest of it. And that's where your mind's going to run out of space. You say, "Well, how come that's not for you and I?" But that's what this word says. &gt;&gt; And the false prophet and the beast and that trinity going to be cast into the lake of fire and those that followed him, those that loved it. I'll tell you what, this world and you're in contact with multitudes of people that love that spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; They love that godless spirit. They love the god-haters of the world and they're part of it. &gt;&gt; But there's another group of people &gt;&gt; getting ready to leave. &gt;&gt; And they are going to leave because they can't be left behind. &gt;&gt; They've already been already been inseparably united. Hallelujah. Oh, I thank God. Next time you hear a message or read a message and you hear and see that revealing of the son of man taking place, you see the you you see that operation of the prophet ministry and you oh, you think that was wonderful for those people. My I'd like to have been back there and had had the secret of my heart revealed. Oh, brother Biscll, you were so privileged. You You sat with them and you were in the same tent and you spent days and even weeks together. It was so privileged. But I say you're even more privileged. &gt;&gt; You're more privileged. You say, "Well, how was that?" Well, because you believed without seeing. &gt;&gt; But when you hear these things, I want you to I want you to grasp one thing. God did all of this for you. &gt;&gt; Just just give me a couple minutes. &gt;&gt; I don't want to leave this. The Bible says that God took of the rib of Adam and he made a woman and brought her to the man. God did that. He took a rib and here's what the exact Greek text says and Jehovah God formed the ri which he had taken from the man into a woman and brought to and brought her in to the man. actually took a part of Christ and formed of that rib into a woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wasn't just poof, but he formed her into a woman. And then that same God brought her to the man. And I became intrigued with this. He made her He made her. And I felt and that's why I stopped here. I felt very very impressed to say this to you as a congregation. God made us made you for Christ. This word he made you. &gt;&gt; He actually formed you. &gt;&gt; That's why you didn't fit in so many places. He actually formed and shaped you. to fit perfectly with this word. &gt;&gt; Made the two of you one. And I went into that made he made you. It says that he actually fashioned and formed. But he says another thing, the word made is that he put he put it in order. And I got thinking about my own life, my own got thinking about the different people that are here and how he had to bring an order, an order perhaps even to your geographic location. Had to bring an order to your thinking, an order to your whole relationship. He had to put it in order. And then it secondly, it also is that he purchased it. Actually, it it is that he owns it. He bought it. He didn't just put it in order. Isn't something when God was done and then he brought her to the man. Do you realize that what's ever happened in your life and everybody's story is entirely different? Do you hear me? &gt;&gt; God God has been working in your life to will and do his own will. And he BROUGHT YOU &gt;&gt; STEP BY STEP. BROUGHT you to the man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; DIDN'T BRING YOU THERE SO YOU BE TWO INDIVIDUALS. BROUGHT YOU TO THIS CHRIST SO THAT HE COULD MERGE YOU AND MAKE YOU into one single unit. &gt;&gt; I've conducted a lot of weddings and I come here and often SAY GOD INSTITUTED marriage back in the Garden of Eden. It was God who instituted it. Let me tell you, God, he's the one who designed this marriage. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS THE IT'S WONDERFUL WHEN A BRIDE AND GROOM COME UP IN ALL OF their beauty of youth. BUT GOD ORDAINED, HE DID SOMETHING MORE WONDERFUL. SOMETIMES HE DIDN'T TAKE SOME BEAUTIFUL THING. HE TOOK SOME RAG TAG OFF THE STREETS. HE TOOK SOME DRUNK. HE TOOK WHATEVER. HE TOOK THE LOWEST. HE TOOK THE SCUM. HE TOOK PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THEIR OWN INTELLIGENCE. HE TOOK PEOPLE THAT WERE SO BOUND. &gt;&gt; I LOOKED ACROSS THIS CONGREGATION. SOME OF YOU WERE IN SUCH DARKNESS. WE ALL WERE. BUT HE TOOK YOU. YOU WERE IN SUCH A STATE OF AFFAIRS. AND GOD BEGIN TO WOO YOU AND DRAW YOU. HE HAD ONE THING IN HIS MIND. A MARRIAGE. A MARRIAGE FOR MY SON. I'M GOING TO BRING HIM A WIFE. I'M MAKING THIS I'M MAKING THIS ONE FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; You've been made for him. You've been actually made for him. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE BEEN CREATED for him. The very makeup &gt;&gt; he's making, he's made you for him. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful thing. Do you take this man &gt;&gt; to be your lawful wed husband? To have and to hold from this day forward, &gt;&gt; for better, for worse, in sickness and in health. AND WHATEVER HAPPENS, YOU TAKE HIM TO BE YOUR OWN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Let's stand. Oh father God of covenants, God of promises, God who has made such serious and righteous covenant with your people, not dependent upon whether we will or whether we can. In many cases, we can't. We haven't got the inner fortitude. We haven't got what it takes. But you have more than what it takes. And then you send the Holy Spirit of God upon us and into us to unite the bride and the bridegroom together. Lord, may we I I pray may this have a uh a new sense of awareness upon us and in the people and throughout today, a consciousness. May it be a PRESENCE THAT WILL ENVELOP US AND SURROUND US. AND LET THE presence permeate us. Oh, eternal God. May the things that were spoken today, Lord, help that the words of my mouth have been uttered and penetrate into the deepest parts of the hearts and understanding of your people. I pray that you'll move, oh God, upon some that may be standing here now that know in THEIR HEART OF HEARTS that they have not made preparation. They have not accepted. They have not yielded. They've not given themselves unreservedly. May they at this moment say, "Oh my God, take me the way I am. COVENANTKEEPING FATHER GOD, TAKE ME AND I ACCEPT YOUR SACRIFICE OF CALVARY. I ACCEPT THE SEPARENCE OF your son. How he was severed from you, that I might be united with you. &gt;&gt; HE BECAME NAKED THAT I MIGHT BE CLOTHED. HE WAS REPROACHED AND MADE ASHAMED TO IN the eyes of the people that I might be accepted. HE WAS BROKEN THAT I MIGHT BE HEALED, that I might be whole. Oh God, I pray you'll make this closet BY THE HOLY SPIRIT to be a reality &gt;&gt; upon each one. And I would urge if there are those that are standing and say, "These are strange things. I've never heard them before, but there's something in my heart that is saying yay and amen. I ask and would counsel you now to make that prayer to Christ. Just say, I give myself to you. I surrender myself to you. And maybe while you're contemplating this or making this prayer, we can just sing, I surrender all. I surrender all. all to Jesus. I surrender. I surrender all. Those of you, you don't need the words. [music] So, you can just have your eyes closed and and pray for that one. [music] Or those that are just think there are some that perhaps have not got peace with God. They haven't been united. Wouldn't it be, isn't it our desire, people, saints of God, to see perhaps one stray sheep? Just come back into the fold, one prodal son, one daughter that's still wewarded. [music] Let them come now, Lord. Let them come. I pray that this word I've spoken this morning will not be fruitless, but it'll bring forth much fruit, Lord, for your glory. &gt;&gt; For your glory alone, I surrender [music] all. [music] I surrender all [music] to thee. My lavior. [music] [chant] [music] Oh, I surrender all. [music] I know. I [music] surrender all [music] to my [music] blessed. [music] All that I have and all that I ever can be and will [music] be. All that I am. [music] All I am, [music] all I shall ever [music] [music] the love that [music] I I surrender [music] to thee together now. All [music] that I am now. All that I am. [music] All I shall ever [music] be. is [music] the love that [music] I surrender [music] to thee. [music] I wonder if you are here and you want prayer in your life. this congregation to pray with you and for you. All you need to do [music] stand and say, "Lord, I make my heart an altar right where I am. And through sin and this natural birth, I was separated from you. But you have made a way for me to become one, united with you." [music] Maybe someone's I've been living a cold and different life, not very fervent. But I realize today again [music] I cannot take this in some casual way. This is not a casual gospel. It's a gospel that burns with the fire of God. Oh God, burn within our soul and our heart. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Touch every life of the living flesh. Those, oh God, that have not been united by the full baptism of the Holy Ghost, [music] may you baptize them. You are that baptizer. Many, oh, been baptized in water and perhaps some have not been baptized with the Holy Ghost. as they receive the word, &gt;&gt; as they accept it, Lord, as they internalize it, [music] may the Holy Spirit in his faithfulness, I know that you will come to it and give them that experience for indeed it is an experience. We thank you, Father. Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, oh God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, friends, as we speak about crossing over in that land that we shall inherit. How marvelous. You bus drivers won't go and face what you face. you factory workers, you wives, your children, [music] some of the schools that you go to, the colleges, there be no such a thing. There is a place of righteousness. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a land of milk and honey. There is [music] our where [singing] there is a landing [music] with us. There [music] we shall see our blessed [music] [singing] reason. Hallelujah. Praise [music] God. The river and mighty river. [music] We shall see [music] our blessing. That's the reason and &gt;&gt; that's [music] the reason we shout hallelujah [music] shining [music] river. [music] There we shall see how blessed. [music] &gt;&gt; Keep it right in the front of your mind and settle it for once and for all. Don't ever have another doubt. [music] At that moment of that change, that moment when we cross over, wherever it is, whether it be [music] by life or by death, at that moment, and I hear that voice [music] once more, enter in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Enter in. [music] Be blessed of the Lord. Hallelujah. Brother Roy Ford, I wonder if you would come, please dismiss us in prayer. if you would please [music] that that's the reason [music] we shout [music] our king across the river that shining [music] Where the saints will gather. There [music] we shall see our Messiah. [music] &gt;&gt; All together. Repeat after me. There I shall see. &gt;&gt; There I shall see &gt;&gt; my blessed Messiah. &gt;&gt; My blessed Messiah. &gt;&gt; That is uttered out of your mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; God heard it. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; The devil heard it. And I'm glad he heard it. &gt;&gt; Brother Roy in prayer. Our gracious loving heavenly father.
