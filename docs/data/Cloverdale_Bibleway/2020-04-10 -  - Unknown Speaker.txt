TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] you [Music] there was a time of my life I was separated from everything including the young lady that I thought I might marry I didn't know but I was God it was about eight months long and during that eight months I had a very very unusual walk with God I guess I would say very unusual I had a rule and I worked in store right below and the Hudson's Bay had bought out my father-in-law he became my father-in-law but he was just the owner and I I was working in the I was manager the produce department and when noontime came I would go up to my room and give the first half hour of my lunch time in prayer and it was just something very special it isn't something that I and advise others or admonish them it was just something that I just did I had longed for it I craved for it I even you know would pinch him the moment so I could be longer there and I would slide out the other chair for the Lord Jesus to sit on and be there and when when the work was over I would sometimes go out and walk and woods or walking there around the creek and just look at the flowers or something and just be overwhelmed at the beauty of it and weep and he said so that was the kind of experience we had and then God was moving in such a way that denominations was nothing it was the people you know if there was a hunger and a desire for God and we under we heard that there was a meeting or I heard that there was a meeting taking place in northern Alberta and there was about 300 350 miles from Laurel we were and I waited till when work was over on Friday and then I took off on my motorcycle that was the only trouble only transportation I had and it was cold and I was suffering from hypothermia I didn't know what what I was and I went to tell about two o'clock in the morning and then I would see if our light flicker or you know way in the distance and I thought oh my goodness I've always was so bashful to do that and then there was one right beside the road a little log house and so I pulled in there real quick it was in the middle of night and the light was on and I leaned my bike up against the log house and tapped on the door and I just heard some voice inside come on him so I opened the door and there was a guy with his feet up on a table reading a book and so I said well I I said I'm just pulling up and I was very cold North almost freezing to death and all he said yeah I said I thought maybe I could bunk here for the night yeah he said you can have a room here and he was a bachelor made a big breakfast in the morning and and I set off the next day and it had snowed that night and so in the afternoon and the Sun was coming out and people were splashing you know spraying me with wet snow and water and so on but I did that to get to a meeting and it was in that waiting that no God confirmed that God had given me the young woman who was my wife to be my wife and I was feeling a call I guess and I can't identify what the call was I think it evolved into you know when I began to speak to my wife and we were actually riding in a car then I'll go back and I said well I wanted her to know I would not be able to give her the kind of life that she knew and that she's experienced and that she's had with her father being a businessman and being in business and so on I said I can't give you that kind of life I said I've been called a preach and that's probably the first time I said that to her I've been called a bridge so I think that now in retrospect I was I was feeling that Paul III I didn't you know we didn't have the example of someone behind the pulpit and someone preaching but it was just a deep hunger for greater things of God and the life that God had for you know what there was you know available and so I was actually frustrated on the bed and I was in great sobs you know just exposing my soul to God and I didn't know what to do I remember taking off my watch and I put it on the bed and I took my billfold out and I put those on the bed and I just surrendered it to God I said my time and what I put in my hands was going to be his and I can't I can't describe any special extended thing from that but I think God sees that and then he just sets your life in a certain course and allows certain things to happen and and he knows that blessings are not going to upset you or they're not going to drive you in a wrong direction you you handle that you and then you you become a trustworthy steward of the things of the kingdom of God God has to have people that can handle funds can handle business the gospel itself is not it's not something that is conducted on you know God can take little buddy and he can take lunch so yeah I just it was something I experienced that was before we were married [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
