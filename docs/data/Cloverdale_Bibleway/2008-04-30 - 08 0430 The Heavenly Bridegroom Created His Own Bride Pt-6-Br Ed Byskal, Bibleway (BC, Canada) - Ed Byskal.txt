Sister Lana wants to give thanks that her her dad is back from death's door and she wants to thank every single person that prayed and spent a moment in time and the Lord's presence on his behalf. Just a absolute miracle that the Lord has brought to our brother. So we want to thank him for that. If you have a need upon your heart, our God is great. Our God is wonderful. We just want to take this time this evening, set aside the week. It'll be there tomorrow, Lord Terry's, but if not, we wouldn't want to have missed an opportunity like we have this evening to meet with our creator once again. Brother Codle, would you come? [Music] Let's bow our heads. [Music] Most gracious Father, we thank you for this night, Lord Jesus. Another opportunity that you've afforded us, Lord, to gather into that name that is above every name, the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Father, we just yield our hearts to you tonight, Lord, that you may take the word and engraft it in us, Father, that we may be changed. And Lord, we do thank you and give you glory and honor tonight. And Lord, we thank you for meeting every need in this body, Lord. So many miracles. So many answers to prayer. We just thank you, Lord. We just take this moment to give you praise, to give you honor, to give you glory, Lord. Father, we thank you now, Lord. We ask that you would anoint the man of God, Father, as he comes forth tonight, Lord, that the man would step out of the way. And that the uncction of your spirit would flow into this place, Lord, and that our hearts and souls will be filled with fresh mana from above, Lord, as you would feed us. Feed your sheep tonight, Lord. We're so hungry and thirsty for you, Lord. We ask, Father, that our hearts and ears would be open and sensitive to that which you would speak to each of us individually, Lord. Meet us where our need is tonight, Lord. We are a needy people, and we're so thankful for your grace and mercy. And we ask this in the name that is above every name, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Amen. God bless you.

So, it's kind of a package deal. It's good for everybody. Praise the Lord. Well, we don't want to take any more time. We invite our pastor to come this evening. Maybe we'll just sing uh 982 on the screen. Elo Elohim. This song sends me right back to Abraham's tent. I can see Abraham sitting in his tent door and seeing Elohim walking down the way. And that's the way my attitude is tonight. I don't see a minister or pastor, Brother Tom, Brother John coming to the pulpit. I come in with the attitude, Elohim is present. &gt;&gt; He's the one that's come that's going to speak to us. We're his bride. &gt;&gt; We're his bride. That's who's desiring to speak to us tonight.

[Music] Let your Higher you come your [Music] Holy Spirit. Holy Spirit, let your fire [Music] holy spirit come. Holy Spirit, let your fire. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's our desire. &gt;&gt; That's why we're here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let your fire fall. I was thinking of that just before coming to the platform. Thinking when John said of Jesus Christ, he said, "He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire." I was just pondering that, you know, not only the Holy Ghost and with fire, it'll be a pure fire. &gt;&gt; It'll be a wonderful flame. Amen. Well, we're going to go immediately to the word. I believe that's why you've come. And I'll read some scripture. Uh we're going to continue on and take part six. from the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride and just see how God will allow us to go this evening. I want to review a little bit of last week, but we can do it quite quickly because I have all the slides in place and uh so we'll just try to cover as much ground as we can in as short a time as we can. Appreciate you all being here this evening. Without you, we wouldn't be having a service. &gt;&gt; That's for sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you for driving the many miles you've driven, taking the time off, and I appreciate it. I know that God appreciates it. Amen. Just before we read, I'm just going to ask the Lord's blessing on our reading. Father, we are so dependent upon you, so incapable within ourselves. And right now, Lord, I'm just casting all my care on you because I know you care for us. Committing this entire service, Lord, in the next uh the next hour or whatever time it is that you lead us, oh God, I pray the Holy Spirit will come and visit each individual where they are. Lord, I pray that you'll speak to them in a language they understand, in terms they understand. I pray, Father, for those that are heavy and burdened that they will hear the words of Jesus Christ. Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden. And so many are today, Lord. And you are the one anointed by God, the word coming to us to loosen the bonds and the bands that bind and the prison from the prison cell. Lord, I pray you'll break the doors of the prison house. Let the people be free, oh God. And we've not come here to be bound and cold and formal. We've come here to en enjoy and worship, oh God, our salvation. And if there's some here who have lost the joy of their salvation, I pray you'll restore that joy of salvation to them again this evening, Lord. And I pray that you'll give utterance to your word, Lord. May my lips simply be a tool in your in your hand and and may you receive all the glory in the name of Jesus Christ. We ask it and thank you, Father God. Amen. I'm going to read out of uh 2 Corinthians once again the fourth chapter, but we'll just uh start to read at the 18th verse and then continue on into the fifth chapter for four verses. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. Isn't that a powerful verse? &gt;&gt; I love that verse. For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens. Now, if I can just have your attention this way for just a moment, please. The Apostle Paul, in fact, is when uh uh when the apostles and those that spoke the word, they didn't speak them into nice little chapters and verses like this. They were just speaking. And then at later time we don't know when in in history man began to assemble it into chapters and so on. So now when Paul is saying while we look not at the things which are uh which are seen. So he's talking about the physical but at the things which are not seen. I want you to really grasp. He's saying while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen. So he's saying we can look at the things which are not seen. &gt;&gt; It's almost a it's it's like a paradox but it's true and you have to catch that because we we need to you know we need to look at the things which are not seen. Everybody has a goal and an objective you know something they want expect to do in life. Show it to me. I'd like to see it so I can handle it. Well I can't really show it to you but I could describe it to you. And if you could describe it accurately enough, then I would get a vision of what it was that you were you that you were h holding in your mind as a vision as an objective. You see, then I could see it. Jesus said, "The world won't see me, but you'll see me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he wasn't going to be here physically. They wouldn't be able to see him. But you'll be able to see me. And now Paul goes straight on into the next verse, which is the next chapter. But don't get don't get distracted by that or derailed by that. He goes right into the next verse and he says, "For we know that if our earthly house," that's what's seen. If our earthly house were dissolved, then you wouldn't see it. If it were dissolved, we have a building of God and house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this we grown earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house. Our house which is from heaven. You should be able to say while you read that with my house which is from heaven. We just This isn't a group revelation. This is an individual revelation. We can't get joy. I can't get joy over the fact that you have it. I get joy over the fact that I have it. You have it. That's where your joy is. So my house which is from heaven, if so be that being clothed, we shall not be found naked. For we that are in this tabernacle do grown, being burdened not for that uh we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality, that's the clothing he's speaking about, that mortality may be swallowed up in life. God bless you as you have your seats. We have a building of God and house not made with hands. Now, our physical body, as we just go over all the several weeks that we've been going over this, our physical body, as we understand from the message, been under construction for a long time. For those of you that browse around on computers and you'll come on pages once in a while, you'll come up on a page and it'll say under construction. And I'm sure you've seen that. And then I go back to that page later on, maybe weeks later, and I still find it's still under construction. I see some of you smiling. You've run into that. And then you might even let two, three months go by and it's still under construction. And I quit going there. They just been under construction too long. Well, we've been under construction a long time. &gt;&gt; And a prophet of God said, you know, that that that sun and that the planet out there and the sun and the clinker flies off and maybe drop for millions of years and then God stopped it. We can't understand all of that. Then it then it you know materials and and elements and whatever more came to make up our body said what was he doing? He was making he was making you. Well, we just pass over that because we don't understand it. Uh we can't comprehend a God of that a you know that kind of power and that kind of control. But that's that's God. All things are possible with him. &gt;&gt; And so our physical body's been under construction throughout the ages. And then we went through how we are a body uh spirit and soul. We have a human spirit that entered our body at the time of birth and giving uh giving life giving animation to our our person so that we can uh we express what we are when you have a child if it's born and it's still born. It may be absolutely perfect. It's got you know 10 fingers and 10 toes and everything's perfect just perfectly shaped. might might even resemble might even see some resemblance of the parents in that child, but it's still born. The spirit did not enter it. There's one thing that's absolutely sure. Now, you don't have to even be a prophet to say it. You say no one will ever know what the nature of that child might have been because there's not. It takes the spirit to enter it to give it animation. &gt;&gt; We don't know whether it's a quiet child or a boisterous child. We don't know whether it was athletically inclined or intelligent or more intelligent or had a higher IQ or what it was or whether it was gifted with art or in music or whatever or we don't know anything about it. We only maybe know it was a boy or it was a girl and that's about it. But the spirit of life did not enter the child was a stillborn. If the Holy Spirit does not come and confirm within the religious world, if the Holy Spirit does not come and confirm that that is his word, that I'm the author of the word that this person has received, then it's a stillborn, a spiritually stillborn, &gt;&gt; because it takes the Holy Spirit to give the animation or the the manifestation of God to that individual. &gt;&gt; You believe that? But I'm sure that you do. &gt;&gt; Now the Bible tells us also that uh that when God had completed his his uh uh creation of of Adam had made Adam, made him an image uh like himself that he breathed into his nostrils and he became a living soul. I I made a distinction last Sunday that it was different between what Adam received than what a child receives when it's born into the world. When uh that which Adam received was God the life of God himself that God had created and breathed into him and he became a living soul. Uh and and and that was in that physical uh body. So now I want to perhaps justh take a couple of the of the slides and and go through from last week with you. Uh and this is the scripture for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved that we have a building of God. We have I I I like that phrase. We have I have a building of God. Not I will have I have that building of God. And we're going to be speaking about that as as we go along. and house that's not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul. Now remember that's in Genesis 2 and 7. But in Genesis 1 and 26 and 27, let us make man uh in our own image. And God created man in his own image. He made him in his own image. And and but but it's in chapter two when he formed him of the dust of the earth, he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living soul. Made him out of the dust of the earth. Now not in his own image that not the dust of the earth. See he said he had he had already made the man. That's in that's in Genesis 1 and 26 and 27. He had already made the man. Then he breathed into him the breath of life and he became a living soul. So the soul of man is the nature of the spirit. And you see the reference there of the message. When you're reborn, you don't get a new spirit. You get a new nature of that spirit. It's the same spirit, but a new nature of it. It's the same spirit, but a new nature. You take two men, stand them together. Both look alike and one of them is a sinner and the other of them is a Christian. One man say, "I got a spirit the same as you have." But one of them is a different. His soul, his nature is different. He's been changed. &gt;&gt; Two standing right together. Genesis 1:26-27. He formed He formed them out of the dust of the earth and breathed into his nostrils. He then he asked the question, what connection does the first man have with the second man? The man that was made in God's image, God is a spirit and the man he made was a spirit man. That was in Genesis 1. In Genesis 2, it says there was no man. He'd already made man in his own image. But in the next chapter, there was no man to till the soil. And as the prophet says, a a spirit doesn't put his hand to a plow and care for the garden. There was no man to care for the care for the garden and to and to care for the earth actually. And so what connection does the first man, the spirit man have with the second man? The first man is the second man made manifest in five senses. He gave him this body and he has the five senses to taste, feel, smell, hear and so on. Now the inside of that is a spirit which you become when you're born in here and the breath of life is breathed into you. That spirit notice I have underlined that spirit is of a worldly nature. I just stop there for a moment. You can take any child boy or girl. You can say I'm I'm going to isolate this child. I'm going to I'm going to take them into the woods into the wilderness. I don't want them to see any evil. I don't want them to be in contact with any evil. I don't want them to hear anything wrong. I don't want them to hear any cursing or slang. I don't want them I don't want them to see television or any I don't want them to be in contact with the world. You can have them out there and isolate them. But it's just as sure as you're breathing God's air, that child, that child will show an evil streak someplace along the way. He'll have a temper or lie to you or do something. Why? because it's born in sin and shapen in iniquities and comes into the world speaking lies. That's just our nature. We have to be changed &gt;&gt; by a new birth. &gt;&gt; And so that breath of life that you took in when we're issued into the world from our mother's womb, that was not that that that is not the Holy Spirit of God. You must be born again. And you must be born again of the word and the Holy Spirit. And then you have the spirit of God. God breathes his spirit into you. We're going to get much more into that. So that was a spirit of a worldly nature because it was not given from God, but it was permitted. It was given or permitted by God. There is a difference between what God breathed into Adam when he became a living soul and when a child is born uh by a natural birth and takes the first breath of life. Before Adam died, prophet said he had a lamb that redeemed him. And the reason we bring that in is because Adam fell. &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve fell in sin, but there was a lamb. The Bible says the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world. I'm just tying a lot of these thoughts together as we move rather quickly. Those who he forneew, the scripture says he has called and he got a lamb to redeem them. He was a type. Adam was a type. Adam fell. Then the lamb was provided for Adam because already in his nostrils had become the breath of the eternal God. That's not Adam didn't have a birth by sexual birth. &gt;&gt; He wasn't conceived by a sexual relationship. He was created by God. That's very very important. I just want to stay with that a moment. Now, &gt;&gt; he already had the breath of eternal God and he became a living soul. Notice now as I ended last week, that was a final act, a final act of God upon his creation that God breathed into him, his breath. That happens to be the same word that is used, the same thought that is used concerning the scripture. All scripture is given by inspiration of God. inspiration is like a a breath of God. And that is why Jesus then did a final act at the second uh when when when he was just getting ready to depart after the resurrection and he breathed upon his disciples and said, "Receive ye the holy receive ye the Holy Spirit. Receive you the Holy Ghost." And that was one of his last acts in his entire ministry is he breathed upon them. That's very important because God, oh my, the Bible says that all things were made by him. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the Bible says all things were made by him and without him was nothing made that is made. Christ was the logos that came out of God by which God uh uh created all things because the scripture says all things were made by him and without him was nothing made that is made. So all things were that was the creative force and that is why all things were made by the word. &gt;&gt; God spoke the word. You know, we we would just bring it down into into at our our level for a moment and I was pondering this today at length. Here we are uh very very different one from another and so on and our lives are different. But there's one thing that we do have in common and that is that your life is largely made up of what you have heard what you have observed in life uh what you have allowed yourself to be affected by. So your maybe your parents instructed you and taught you in certain things, your father, your mother, and they said, "Now look dear, this is the way you do things. And if you do it this way, this is what happens." And so maybe maybe mother taught the girls how to how to cook or how to bake. And if you do this, you'll have a flop. You'll have a failure. &gt;&gt; Some of you young ladies that when you first got married, uh, you know, maybe you had to learn how to cook. I don't know. Hope you have kind husbands. And my wife, my wife doesn't mind because we've been married a long time now, but she made some biscuits when we first got married. And I looked at those biscuits and I said, "The only thing that would raise those is dynamite. They were flat and heavy." And uh they weren't like those nice fluffy biscuits. But you ought to see the biscuits she cooks now. And she'd just cook them up in a few minutes. And you know, uh, I said, "Well, we got any bread for toast?" "No, don't worry. I'll just make some biscuits." And she has biscuits on the table there are hot and steaming and they're just lovely in just a few moments. But we didn't learn it. So, learn it overnight. But something we acquired in life. Some of you fellas, I looked at you, you know, and you said, "Well, I'm a drywaller and I'm a carpenter and I'm this and I'm that and and uh where'd you learn it?" Well, you know, I just hung around this person or that fellow told me or I read it in the book. I went to school and I read it. So, we we become what we are largely by what we've heard and what we've seen and what we've observed. And you you parents now that have children, you don't even have to say a whole lot to your children. They're watching you. They're just observing you. And even when they're not realizing that they're observing you, they are observing you and they're learning. They're simply acquiring habits, they're acquiring uh traits, they're acquiring things by observing you. And now when we become a believer, we become born again. And we begin to feed on the message. We begin to feed on the word. I can tell you that you might hear something. You may hear a message. You may hear a tape. and and that that may not you might not realize there's any effect on you at all but on down the road that's affected you it's affected your thinking and it forms you into the kind of person that you become brother Brandham says that the those prophets of old they were in the deserts so long uh in the presence of God they were transformed persons creatures transformed men they come out of that presence of God I tell you what it's It's a power. It's something real. It's a reality. &gt;&gt; And it has an effect on the individual. All right? So, he became a living soul. And when God breathed into Adam, uh what God breathed into Adam is equal to what he's breathing into us by the breath of his word, by the breath of his message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here's where I came to end. Now last week this breath of life is the final act in God's labor bringing forth our house which is from heaven a a word body. Now this is it. I know it gets over some people's heads but just hang on here. So the power of the revealed word of God breathing eternal life into us here and now building our house which is from heaven. Now, for those of you that weren't here last week, and I'll just say this now. In his final act, Jesus breathed on his disciples, saying, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost. The Son of Man revealed in this last age, breathes into his bride body as a last and final act of his ministry." And I've called it the breath of the third Paul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Or the resurrection breath. I want that breathed over me. &gt;&gt; I don't want it when I'm six feet under. &gt;&gt; I want the breath of the resurrection breathed into me now and here. &gt;&gt; I want to have that present with me. &gt;&gt; That breath of life that you took when you were just a few seconds old. You still have it. &gt;&gt; You've been through a lot, but you still have it. &gt;&gt; See what I mean? You had it then and you needed it then or you'd have been still born and you still have it now. And when that leaves you, you're going to be finished. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's one place we all find common ground. If that if a if a person goes the way of the grave on the slab, doesn't matter whether you're rich, poor, what you were, healthy, sick, whatever, we're all on common ground. Then &gt;&gt; I want the breath of the resurrection life. Now merging uh the merging of the visible with the invisible. And I pointed out when you were born because the natural types the spiritual when you were born into this world. Now you you just you must see this when you were born into this world. God permitted that spirit, that human spirit that you have that's unique to yourself and it fits your person, your your physical being, your physical your your your physical body, who you are. It's not some something strange. It's not some uh some different kind of species that came to you. This I hope this doesn't sound foolish, but just listen for a moment. It wasn't something foreign. It had to fit you. &gt;&gt; That spirit was made for that body that came. &gt;&gt; Those two merged together, the invisible, like brother Brandham says, you've never seen me &gt;&gt; and I've never seen you. &gt;&gt; The real you, I've never seen &gt;&gt; and the real me, you've never seen. &gt;&gt; We shake hands. We smile at one another. We look into one another's faces. But quite frankly, we have never seen each other because at some point in time when you were birthed into this world, a a an element from the invisible &gt;&gt; came and merged with the physical self. &gt;&gt; And when they're separated, there is no more no more you really you. you've passed into another another place for the believer for the believer that has believed that's been birthed of this seed. &gt;&gt; Now this is a seed. &gt;&gt; This produces something. &gt;&gt; I I have to speak perhaps elementary but it is like and I've used this analogy many times but you can find the most awkward young man in in you know 15 or 16 years old. What do you want to be? I want to be a doctor. No, I don't I don't want to just be a doctor. I I want to be a brain surgeon. What's going to transform that awkward uh uh fellow like with he's got 10 thumbs? What's going to uh you say, "Well, I hope if I ever need surgery, I don't fall under your scalpel." But what's going to transform him from that into the kind of person that he he could be perhaps one of the finest doctors there is? He will study the words of learned men. He will study the words of those that have experienced and experimented and and all of the things that he can uh get lay his hands on. and he will go to school and he will be mentored by uh by men of great great intelligence in that particular field and on a few years it may take him 8 10 or 12 years to go into that kind of special field but that awkward young man will be transformed into maybe one of the finest surgeons in the country. What did it? Bunch of books. &gt;&gt; We are transformed. &gt;&gt; This word that I hold tonight has infinite power. &gt;&gt; It's not going to make us into some qualified person here on earth for a job or a profession, but it's going to make you ready &gt;&gt; to pass from this realm into another realm. And that's the kind of power, that's the kind of word that I want to give myself to. You need to give yourself to &gt;&gt; in the message who is this Melzdc. Uh brother Brandham went on to say God in this stage of his creation. You understand there was a certain stage of his creation later formed into the into flesh into Jesus Christ became Jesus Christ and from the great beginning spirit then came down to be the word bringing itself out he becomes flesh Jesus uh mortal to taste death for all of us sinners when Abraham met him he was Melzdc now watch there's three things happening here when Abraham met him. He was Melzdc, king of Salem, priest of the most high God. And that was a theophony. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; He unfolds here what all of his attributes, all the attributes will do in the final day, in the final end, every son of Abraham, every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing. In other words, they will he was he was displaying to Abraham the kind of body that his sons would come to in every son of every son and daughter of God. He said we see the attribute sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word form body of theophony. This body is subject to the word and waiting for the earnest change of the body. Now last week and brother Brandham in this in this message he also goes into how a how a mother and I I just want to uh cover this as well how a mother carrying a child now we all were there every person is here and I I'm speaking to adults and those who understand you young people we've spoken very plain here but we all were in our mother's womb and in that state our mother at some point craved for something. She craved for a certain thing, but that craving was actually your body. You don't remember that, but your your body was craving for certain things and that it required and your mother craved for those things that the child might receive that that you would receive it and be born a healthy child. Now that is God's God ordained it to be that way. And now the prophet of God is is showing us very clearly taking from what apostle Paul has written. If this body, if this tabernacle be dissolved, we have another waiting eternal in the heavens. &gt;&gt; Now we might just, you know, these are these are some of my own personal questions. I know that we we're speaking about the rapture last night over brother brother Joe and sister Bobby's but I personally believe that that theophony body that you have I would suggest to you that it's been under construction also you've been under construction a long time and something is taking place that you and I uh we we have very little concept of we have what Apostle Paul has said what brother Brandham has said concerning that we have another uh now you just go back for a moment now you're you're in your you're in your infancy you're you're just been conceived in the womb uh and you have uh uh you're you're forming you're being formed and uh your body is calling for certain elements and certain vitamins And uh the the mother now becomes she is the incubator. She is uh carrying you and she is taking on these things that you are calling for and your body is receiving that. You're not aware of it at all. The prophet of God is saying that you have a body. And the reason why I say it's under construction is because the prophet also says that God will call you have a certain desire. You have a certain desire. Now hold it close. Now you have a certain craving. In this we grown not to be unclothed upon but to be clothed upon. We grown for something. The very the very thing your desire may be different from this person's desire. And that person may be different from this person's desire. And there may be some sitting here that have no desire whatsoever. I'd be real real distressed if I was sitting here under the sound of the gospel and had no desire for eternal things and no thought about what's beyond this short little brief life which is just a breath just a whisper. What is your life? &gt;&gt; It's even a vapor. &gt;&gt; You might feel young and strong and full of energy and vigor. Don't count on that. That body can just be gone like that. And furthermore, your life, your strength, you may be strong today, you could be struck down and sick tomorrow. &gt;&gt; People aren't as strong and athletic and all the rest of it and and and suddenly their health is gone. &gt;&gt; Our breath is in God's hand. And if I had no desire, I would really be troubled. But you have a certain desire, a yearning, a craving. It is something that is it's it's constant. It's there all the time, sometimes greater than at other times. I'm so thankful for a message that tells you you have a body &gt;&gt; uh beyond the beyond this curtain of time &gt;&gt; that is is calling to you is calling to you. &gt;&gt; He said it's actually calling to you. &gt;&gt; So you have a desire. A lot of people just think, well, I have a desire. I have such a desire never seems to be met. Never seems to be satisfied. I have news for you. your your body &gt;&gt; on the other side that's under construction is calling for you. And the prophet of God says because you have that desire, God will call a man to the pullpit and preach something. Why? He'll preach a word because that word is going to change and transform you like the young man that's being changed from an awkward boy into a into a into a great surgeon of some kind by words which he reads, which he hears, the things that he learns and he puts into practice. But now that is just for time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's just for this life. And he becomes a a professional man. But now here we come into a spiritual realm. We come into a whole spiritual thing. And what it is, friends, as I ended, I was so inspired last Sunday. It is the it is the breath of God. Jesus breathed upon the disciples said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; And then when Peter got up after he received the infilling of the Holy Spirit, he stood up and he said, and he cried out to the thousands that were gathered, "Now hear my words." Because now he was going to breathe upon that crowd. And when he finished breathing on them, they Bible says they were pricricked in their heart. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of breath &gt;&gt; we want breathed out upon us. They were pricricked in their heart and they cried out, "Men and brethren, what must we do to be saved?" &gt;&gt; Now, that had a spiritual effect &gt;&gt; upon them. And here comes a message. We can call it a message and this and that. And brother Brandham said this. Let's just put different words to it. God, I will say the son of man in this day breathed upon this generation with a breath of life from God. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Look at the change it made in you. &gt;&gt; What was it? Not just some books, not just some tapes. the breath of almighty God. &gt;&gt; And where did he breathe it? He breathed it into your nostrils and you become a living soul. &gt;&gt; Transformed by the power of God. &gt;&gt; You find people down the street or wherever or maybe sitting right next to you and and read the same scripture, nothing happens. &gt;&gt; But when the spirit of God, what is it? It's the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit of God. He is confirming that he's the author of the word that you have not just heard in your ears, but you believed in that channel to the soul. And you remember me speaking now, you're made of body, spirit, and soul. And there's five channels to the body, five channels to the spirit, and one channel to the soul. And in that channel, you will either believe or disbelieve. If you disbelieve, then the Holy Spirit does not come. There is no life and it's ineffective. &gt;&gt; It's invalidated because by unbelief &gt;&gt; if you believe &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, help thou my unbelief. &gt;&gt; I believe what I hear. I receive that word as a word that come from you. I receive that word as the breath of almighty God. No different than the breath that God breathed into Adam." Not one bit different. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The same breath. &gt;&gt; The same inspiration. And God breathes it into us in this generation. And a third pull, a final act. For those of you that know the message, the last part. &gt;&gt; It was the last part. &gt;&gt; God capped off his creation by breathing into him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He became a living soul. Jesus finished his remarkable earthshaking ministry by breathing on the disciples and the church was born 50 days afterwards. And then and then in the revealing of the son of man, Jesus prophesying of our day and then and then he comes and reveals himself. Oh my, when I when I think of how God demonstrated himself and took control of the body realm by healings, &gt;&gt; marvelous healings, &gt;&gt; oh, no wonder you're smiling, Sister Lana, we smile with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Lana's father we've been praying for here 84 years old uh taken and rushed to the hospital and laid there unconscious in a uh with with cardiac arrest with in a ventilator breathing for him and and all I could pray all I could pray I mean the man has lived a long life all I could pray she's claiming his soul he's praying for her soul she's spoken to him over the years for his soul. And excuse me, Sister Lan, I hope you don't mind because this is just this evening, just before I haven't even spoken to her. She spoke to my wife. And I expected, quite frankly, I expect her husb her her father at that age to to pass at any moment here. He's he's he's alert. Correct. They moved him out of ICU, moved him up into a regular ward. and and the whole thing has just dramatically changed. &gt;&gt; And and in prayer, all I could say is uh Sister Lana, may God honor now and may your prayers may your prayers and your arms. &gt;&gt; I think we can give a I think we can give a a bouquet once in a while. And our sister Lana has been a giving person. It doesn't matter whether it's food for the for someone or a big pot that or flowers or whatever more. And when there was a big need in Brazil, and I don't often do this, and I hope she won't be embarrassed, but when there was a need in Brazil for our our brother to go, brother Cesar, to go on the television, and and God knew he would only have a few months to do it, a little over one year. And both people are sitting in this audience right now. And I was met by three people and one came against me with a vengeance that we would support television. I said, "I'm not supporting television. I have no desire to be on television ever. I'd never said anything." I read a portion of a man's letter, a man who has a door, great door open. I just read the last paragraph of his letter and I was I was met with such a such a terrible spirit before I even got to the corner of this building in the hallway. And I was met also in the hallway by another person says, "God has spoken to me about that and I want to I'll be giving you checks for this amount." And when I got into my office, there was an envelope slid under the door. And I opened up the envelope and it happened to be from our sister Lana. And she says, "I feel to pledge X amount. I'll be giving like about $2,000 a month for the next six months." And the whole television bill for one year, $48,000 was already paid before I even got to my office. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sister Wana, that's why I prayed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has heard your prayers. &gt;&gt; And has seen your arms. That's exactly what the angel said &gt;&gt; in the scripture. &gt;&gt; This has been a giving church. &gt;&gt; And I just tell you friends, God God is one that sees that. &gt;&gt; He has seen your sacrifice. He has seen your desire to get this message. Why? It's not just some books. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Somebody reads those words. That's right. &gt;&gt; And then the Holy Spirit, are you with me? &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit of God says, "I'm the author of those words." &gt;&gt; And I'll give life to them &gt;&gt; when it enters into the soul realm. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give life to them. &gt;&gt; And life breaks forth. And it's not you. It's not what your mother and father give you. It's what your heavenly parent gave you. God almighty give it to you. &gt;&gt; I say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you don't mind me taking and being a little bit personal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But when the testing of his word is over, this body is subject to the word and waiting for the earnest change of the body. But when the testing of his word is over, then we are taken up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world. Do you folks believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the word there that we skipped to come right around there down here to be tempted and tested. Now listen, and I perhaps see this clearer than I could maybe state it to you, but you sit, you come into the house of God, you're perhaps at home and you have a certain craving, and it won't be perhaps the craving you had a month ago or 6 months ago, but you have a yearning and you're desiring uh uh something from God in your life. I want I want you to recognize and now is my firm belief that your eternal home, your theophony body is calling for that. And then if God has obedient servants to come behind the pulpit and you've experienced this, I'd be very disappointed if you haven't experienced this. you craved, you desired, and you came here and and sat down and the very word you needed came across the pull pit. &gt;&gt; How many have had that? &gt;&gt; I've had that. &gt;&gt; See this Bible here? I will have perhaps read one scripture, read a certain scripture stood out to me. And I thought, you know, I'm going to ponder that. I'm going to give myself to that. I believe the Lord wants me to speak on that. I'll come here and sit right in that chair and a man of God comes here to the pulpit, whichever the minister, and he'll open up the Bible and come right to that scripture and read that very scripture and begin to expound on it. Well, you can you can just well know what's going on in my life, in my heart. It's not just something, oh, isn't that wonderful? You know, I just thought about that. I just read about that or we just spoke about that and many of you could come to me and say that meeting after meeting and week after week. Let me say to you, it is your eternal home. It is your eternal home. It's your body that's calling for it. The same as you did in your mother's womb called for a certain thing. Your mother was obedient and went and got it and your daddy pinced perhaps and got the thing that you needed that you needed and you didn't know that you were getting it and you were receiving something from it at the sacrifice of others. And here we are today receiving a glorious message at the sacrifice of others and God breathing into you the breath of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; How marvelous &gt;&gt; this great plan of God. &gt;&gt; We'll never never figure God out completely. In order to stand temptation, you had to bypass the theophony. In other words, we didn't come like Adam came. That's right. &gt;&gt; He was created in the image of God. But you skipped around that and every person came through a natural birth in order to stand temptation. You had to bypass the theophony. You had to come down here in the flesh to be tempted by sin. We have to be tempted by this evil present evil age. Isn't it marvelous though that in the midst of that here you have a craving for God that God is going to send a messenger going to send a word to you. You're going to be directed by the Holy Spirit to a scripture. You may be directed by uh by the man of God coming behind the pulpit or one way or another God's going to minister that craving because you're craving not to be unclothed but to be clothed upon. That craving is calling that that word body is calling. In other words, uh when when God fore orained you, you believe you're fore orained. When God fore orained you to live here at this season, at this time in history, God also God also left part of this word which needed to be fulfilled and manifested. There was a bride to be manifested. Had to be manifested. She's spoken of here in the scripture. There's types of her all through the Old Testament. And it's spoken of her and she appears in the book of Revelation. It's called the bride of Jesus Christ and it's called the wife of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Jesus, the most eligible bachelor that ever came to the earth, ever walked on the earth, never took a wife in his human existence, but he does now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; I read something very interesting just this last week speaking about Israel because you know Israel is spending now celebrating 60 years their 60th anniversary and they talked about the Jews coming years ago many many years ago when it was uh other people of other lands and other other nations were inhabiting Israel and they said that when those first people arrived there they found that it that she was married to another man. I thought that was very interesting. They found that their bride was married to another man. Their nation was married united to another people. It isn't that amazing that they use that kind of language. That's such a that's almost message language. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's just so perfect with the scripture. Amen. But our Lord Jesus Christ now comes and take a a wife to himself. And you've come here now to stand temptation and you have to bypass that theophony. And brother Brandham calls it your word your your word body. Your word body. When God sent you here, your portion is not the next person's portion, &gt;&gt; and my portion is not yours, and yours isn't mine. You want to thank God for that? &gt;&gt; Seriously. &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Isaac. &gt;&gt; But you have a portion. &gt;&gt; What is it? Just allow me to belabor the point. A word portion. I'm just putting some thoughts that brother Benham left us. He said that's your word body and you sit here, you come in contact and you have a craving for the word. &gt;&gt; That's your word body and God sent you. You bypass that to come here to be tempted and tested. What is the temptation? What is the what is the testing all about? It is because one power and that's the power of Satan is very determined to throw every obstacle in front of you so that you will not fulfill your course. &gt;&gt; That's the obstacle. But God is determined that you shall hear the right word, that you shall surrender yourself to the right word, and the Holy Spirit will empower you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Energize you &gt;&gt; because it's your body that's calling to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I want to try and encourage you just now, regardless of the temptation that we're called to go through, it also has been ordained that it's a glorious church &gt;&gt; without spot, &gt;&gt; without wrinkle or any such thing. &gt;&gt; How powerful is this breath of God? I was touched. I'm touched by things that are very, very real. And I find that brother Brandham, you know, people think maybe he tells a long story. It's not that. But he encounters a woman that's lived a very, very unclean life. And it's called from that time in the message from that time. And he says, I said, "A lovely," I'm breaking into their conversation. He's speaking to her and I said, "A lovely young woman like you. Don't you desire to be married and have babies like all mothers do and so forth." And she said, "I would love to, sir, but look at me. What could I offer anyone?" And I said, 'You've got one thing you could offer.' And she said, 'What is that?' And I said, 'Your soul to Jesus Christ.' &gt;&gt; And she said, "Sir, he wouldn't receive it." I said, "Oh, yes, he will." And said, "How do you know that he would? I've tried." And I said, "Yes, you're just turning over pages, but you really but you really come to him." And she said, "What could he do with me?" I said, "Make a lady out of you." She said, "Not me. I'm too far gone." Now, listen, friends, &gt;&gt; you might consider me off at the top, but this next paragraph, I believe, is the breath of God to this woman. Amen. &gt;&gt; I said he can take you back &gt;&gt; to the time when you was a virgin innocent girl. The blood of Jesus Christ is sufficient and powerful to transform the violent sinner to the bloodwash saint guiltless before God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where's she going to hear that? &gt;&gt; Where's the textbook? She's going to hear that. &gt;&gt; Who's going to read that to her? &gt;&gt; And if she believes that, that's exactly what would happen to her. &gt;&gt; Because God's prepared to stand behind that, take the vilest, the most unclean, and even in your state, and take you back and turn you back into a virgin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, if God would do that, How much more he take the bride of Jesus Christ and blot out every sin, erase every transgression. &gt;&gt; And you might say, "I know I've been born in sin and shaped in iniquity." I have a word for you. &gt;&gt; And there has been a breath that God has breathed into this generation. &gt;&gt; And he's saying that he's saying to you uh that you will be made a living soul. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not someone just forgiven, but someone that is purified and taken back to your sinless estate. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's not a man or a woman, but what Satan exercises and uses &gt;&gt; over time &gt;&gt; in the channel of them in memory. There isn't a person here, not a person that has things that you say, "I wish I had never encountered that. I wish I had never done that. I wish I had never fell into that." I got news for you. &gt;&gt; God is breathing &gt;&gt; upon this generation. &gt;&gt; God has breathed upon it &gt;&gt; with a breath. &gt;&gt; I know a power that'll take you back and make you sinless. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's why he said he said you never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Notice the emphasis is on the first place. In the first place, you never did it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of gospel I believe. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of message that we preach. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sinless before God. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that we are without reproach &gt;&gt; in his sight. Yes, &gt;&gt; maybe not our neighbor's sight, but in his sight, he looks upon the bride of Jesus Christ, says, "You're sinless. &gt;&gt; I didn't just forgive you. I took you back to your sinless state. That's how I saw you. That's how I envisioned you. &gt;&gt; And that's what I've done." And the Bible says, "We are the house of God. We are God's house. We are God's building." &gt;&gt; There isn't a man. There isn't a school. There isn't a theology. There isn't a church in the world that can turn you into that. But only the breath of God alone. And what is the breath of God? Thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; You think he was just telling this little lady sick? Sick of her own life. &gt;&gt; Nobody would have me. Which man would have me? I have nothing to offer. I'm a rich. &gt;&gt; I'm the violist. I have nothing to offer anybody. God wouldn't even take me. Yes, he will. He won't only take you. He'll take you back to the beginning. &gt;&gt; He'll take you back the way he pictured you in your in his mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's going to bring forth what he had in his mind. He's the great He's the great sculptor. &gt;&gt; He's the one that's building the masterpiece. &gt;&gt; And nobody can change his plan. &gt;&gt; He's going to bring it forth &gt;&gt; till he look on it and say, "It's good. It's very, very good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's looking on it. He's saying, "It's perfect. &gt;&gt; It's my handywork. &gt;&gt; I did it. &gt;&gt; I built it. &gt;&gt; I purified it. &gt;&gt; I paid the price. &gt;&gt; Newly created blood of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Purchased our redemption. &gt;&gt; Not half of it, all of it. and made you sinless and guiltless before God. &gt;&gt; That's the scripture &gt;&gt; and it's been confirmed in this time. &gt;&gt; You can't believe it. You can't disbelieve the voice of God and come to that kind of state. &gt;&gt; But if you say in your heart tonight, I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe it with everything that's in me. &gt;&gt; And if there's something in you that's calling, &gt;&gt; you might even be here. never heard these things before, but there's something in you that's calling. &gt;&gt; You know, there's people who walk the streets. There's people who good people, but they they have no hope. They have no place. They have no rel place to let off the pressure. They're just searching. I run into them regularly. So do you. But if there's something they're calling, that means there's something for you. I believe that with all my heart. &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world, his name's on the lamb's book of life. Now he speaks about Christ. Then from that he became the word. Christ became the word. The theophony that could appear disappear. A theophony can appear and disappear. &gt;&gt; And then he became flesh. &gt;&gt; Now he appeared in a theophony to our father of the faith Abraham. Yes sir. So he appeared as a theophony then. &gt;&gt; Then he came and became flesh. The word became flesh. Follow this closely. In a virgin born, not through a sexual relationship. In a virginborn son called Jesus Christ in the end time. And back here he met Abraham in a Theophony. Here he comes to the earth in the flesh to take the body to Calvary as a sacrifice. In the end time, the same son of man, the same Lord Jesus Christ, now uses a redeemed vessel &gt;&gt; and brings it to full adoption to demonstrate before a generation of people and to be a mouthpiece for God so that he can take that portion of the book that has still been sealed and breathe it out. It needed to be breathed out. We say, "Well, the seven seals." Listen, it's not just some messages. The word needed to be breathed out. &gt;&gt; The breath the breath of those words needed to be breathed out upon the people to bring the final transformation to the people to prepare us for what is coming. Now, &gt;&gt; we expect the change of the body. I can tell you any change of the body, any rapture experience is involved in that breath of God. &gt;&gt; He says he could appear, disappear, and then he became flesh and returned back again, resurrected that same body in a glorified condition. But you bypassed the theophony and became flesh man to be tempted by sin. And then if this earthly tabernacle is dissolved, quoting Paul's words, we have another already waiting. We have not yet. We have not yet the bodies. But when this body receives the spirit of God, the immortal life inside of you, it throws this body, this earthly tabernacle in subjection to God. And then when you become subject to the spirit, it throws your whole being subject to that spirit. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? And that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quickened made alive. Tell you what, you need to chew that last two lines for a while. And that and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word &gt;&gt; made manifest or quickened made alive. &gt;&gt; What? Why? How? How can be quickened? We're quickened by the breath of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the Bible said, "Don't do this," that body quickly turns to it. There's no question. And what is it? It's the earnest of the resurrection. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So now you've received the spirit upon that word and you're you have craving and you're groaning and you're yearning and you're desiring. Not just those are not just natural desires. Your eternal home is calling for that. That's a word home and you're craving for the word. And God sends a man behind the pullpit to preach the very word you're craving. &gt;&gt; It's your eternal home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then because the Holy Spirit has control of the individual, they they turn quickly in obedience. &gt;&gt; Have you experienced that? &gt;&gt; I have a breath of God for you. &gt;&gt; Says you have the earnest &gt;&gt; of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; That ought to turn somebody loose. &gt;&gt; You mean I've got the down payment of the resurrection? You have it. &gt;&gt; You've desired. You crave certain things and God spoke to you. God sent the word that you needed that you were craving and when you heard it, it changed you immediately. That is the down payment of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; You have the down payment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know when you have a down payment on something, &gt;&gt; down payment on a piece of property or down payment on an automobile or something, somebody give you a down payment. Say, "My car is for sale. My pickup's for sale." Okay, fine. Oh, I just wish I could sell this thing. Oh, and you're just all distressed over it. Just wish I could sell it. And somebody comes along says, "Yeah, that's that's a nice pickup." Yeah. Yeah, it's a great pickup. It just, you know, I think I'll buy that. Okay. Here, I'll I'll give you $500 down. You take that $500. You know the heaviness that you had earlier in the day, it's just gone. It's just gone. You know, you know that that downcast look on your face. It's gone. It's replaced with a smile. Actually changed the whole physical features. Maybe your friends or your parents or your or wife or husband says, "What happened?" Oh, I I sold the truck. You did? How do you know? Well, is it is it really sold? Yes, sir. I got I got the down payment right here. Yes, it's all sold. It's a done deal. &gt;&gt; You feel real good about it because you got the earnest. Don't ever forget that craving that's within you. &gt;&gt; And then the obedience to the Holy Spirit speaking you and turning just that degree I turned. &gt;&gt; I heard the voice. I turned. It spoke to me. And I begin to obey and move in that direction. Not obeying a creed. not obeying a tradition. They can make all kinds of changes. You can go and join a club and it'll make all kinds of changes. Not that kind of a change, but the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; something within you and it indexed you around and has kept moving you, indexing you, changing you. Why? Your eternal home is calling for it. And the fact, and now prophet gives you this glorious truth. The fact that you turn that little bit &gt;&gt; is the down payment. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got the resurrection. &gt;&gt; You've got the down payment. You've got the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Isn't that good news? &gt;&gt; Isn't that good enough to come to church on Wednesday night to hear? I just going to go home tonight. I got the down payment of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; has witnessed it. This body will be raised up again &gt;&gt; because it's already started. &gt;&gt; I know if you folks want to get excited, but I'm getting excited. &gt;&gt; It's already started. Why? Because you heard it. The Holy Spirit did something. You moved. It changed you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was once subject to sin and mire and corruption, but now it's got the earnest. It's turned heavenly. Now that's the earnest that you're going in the rapture. It's the earnest. So you don't only have the down payment of the resurrection. If you go that way, you got the down payment of the rapture. Have the down payment. Hello folks sitting here this evening. Wednesday night. I'm not preaching some little tale to you. I'm telling you what a prophet messenger has said. And if he was standing here, he couldn't say anything else. I'm giving I'm giving breath to his words. &gt;&gt; And I believe that his words, God gave him breath &gt;&gt; so he could say that you have the earnest the down payment of the rapture &gt;&gt; within you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not to just give you a good feeling. That's the breath of God. &gt;&gt; That's God's promise. In other words, &gt;&gt; a sick person laying, dying. I don't know what sister Lana has said in prayer, but I believe that her prayers on behalf of her father have been the breath of God &gt;&gt; to that man's soul. &gt;&gt; And if he slipped away tomorrow, &gt;&gt; it'll have been God that brought him to his awareness &gt;&gt; and consciousness. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we said today, Sister Lana, that God has given you this time and given him that reprieve. Whatever it is, if God raised him to good health, fine. But if you shall slip away, God gave you this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Breath of God. I believe in the breath of God more. I've never seen it in I've never seen it in my entire life like I see it now. &gt;&gt; Never thought of it before in that light. Never. never used the term a third pull breath. &gt;&gt; A resurrection breath. &gt;&gt; It had to happen. &gt;&gt; It had to take place. &gt;&gt; And God in his program ordained that you would live at this time. Other than that, if you consider yourself an accident or just a birth through your mother and father coming together, you're not getting the message. You're not getting God's word. God allotted you to come to this generation. God ordained that you would hear the words that you've heard. God has ordained that you would sit in this service tonight. And God's program is that something that is being spoken answers to the groaning, &gt;&gt; the desire that's within. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you've ever heard Excuse me. I'm just going to come to an end in just a few minutes because I don't want to be long now. But I heard a little phrase a long time ago and and probably it's a common phrase says uh you know listen to your pain, listen to your body and God has given me wonderful wonderful health all my life but I've remembered those little phrases and sometimes uh you know you're just not feeling good just not feeling good at all. That's when the devil comes and tells you, "You're getting sick." You &gt;&gt; ever heard that? &gt;&gt; He He He has the same phrases all the time. He plays on them all the time. You're getting sick. You're getting the flu. And uh I get feelings, so I don't feel good. And I go and I open the fridge door and I stand there and I stare at everything in the fridge. And I have some kind of a craving, but I haven't identified it. And I'll be standing and staring at that fridge and uh I just I'm I'm trying to listen to my body. I'm trying to listen to what I'm craving for, I'm desiring. And sometime there it is. Buttermilk. I want some buttermilk. When's the last time I drank buttermilk? I can't even remember. It's so many years ago. But you're craving for something and finally you identify it. Say that's it. I just need that. Or I'll or I'll say something to my wife. I I'm just craving a certain something and and maybe you can make it up for me and that's what I feel like having. Don't want anything else. Don't want anything else. make me some of this. You know, your system's craving for it, but you know, you can't hardly identify it. And I said that for this reason. I'm coming to a close now. Many times, you know, you're busy with life, you're working, you're occupied, you're under pressure. But if you could just get all that debris away, &gt;&gt; you'll find that down inside is a certain craving. You know what it is? God's trying to break through that curtain of time and just on the other side and right beside you &gt;&gt; is a word body. Now, now I'm not thinking of a word body as like I am here with hands and feet and so on. You know, my life uh my life is is involves a whole lot more than just this frame. It involves those that are close to me. It involves those that I fellowship with. It involves a whole environment. Your word body, what God has promised you is not 10 toes and 10 fingers and say, "Oh, it's a wonderful theophony. You know, you're going to be so much younger. You're going to be so handsome. You're going to be so beautiful." That's not it entirely. Sure, I'm sure you're going to have a dwelling place, but it's far beyond that. In that realm, you'll know as you're known. You'll have you'll have completely uninhibited fellowship. You'll have uh you'll have experienced relationships like you never never could because this flesh stands in the way. This mouth can't say it right. This mind has plagued a good thought, a bad thought, a suspicious thought, a critical thought, a wonderful thought, all joy, all just come plaging. You won't have any of that there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your word body is a whole environment. It's a whole living atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Look, when brother Brandham went beyond the curtain of time, what's the first thing? What's the first thing he said? He saw millions of people. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that's what he's describing. And to come running and to come embracing our brother and he's hearing our brother, our precious brother. That whole experience is part of what what you're being called to. &gt;&gt; This world is not my home. &gt;&gt; I'm just a passing through. &gt;&gt; I thought of the children in their little song. Uh uh some of the Sunday school children perhaps remember it. God's still working on me. &gt;&gt; You remember that one? &gt;&gt; God's still working on me, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This world is not our home. &gt;&gt; Let's just read this last couple. A sick person laying dying. Nothing left but death. That's all. That's all can happen. I've seen the shadows of people done eat up with cancer and tuberculosis and see them persons a little while a little while after that perfectly normal and strong. If there is no divine healing then there's no resurrection because divine healing is the earnest of the resurrection. How many were really touched by brother Toby and such Rebecca's testimony? &gt;&gt; Isn't it marvelous to have a doctor say the chromosome's back? &gt;&gt; Where'd it go? &gt;&gt; I don't know. My family doctor had to tell my wife that a growth that she had, we're going to operate and remove this growth. She probably won't like me saying this cuz she's very private person, but I want to give glory to God. And they did. And he came to her bedside. the next morning and he said, "We couldn't find it." She said, "Where did it go?" He said, "We don't know." &gt;&gt; And I said, "Praise God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what I believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's stand, shall we? &gt;&gt; Our dear loving Lord Jesus. We just don't know how to adequately express you. We've spent this evening here. &gt;&gt; And the dear people have come. They've listened attentively. And I pray Lord, you will reward them. I can't, but I know that you will. Reward them with something that will remain branded upon their hearts and minds. Place it down into their soul. Oh God, give them a jubilee. I pray. Father, tonight I want to pray for brother Jim Douly's sister. She's one of these &gt;&gt; at the last stages of cancer. Oh God, how needy she is right now, Lord. How needy she is. is and we do not know the state of her soul but as our brother Jim will see her we believe very soon the next day or two I pray that you'll go with him we're praying as a congregation you'll send and and infuse him with the Holy Spirit infuse him with a divine presence a presence for in your presence the supernatural is happening oh God is happening and we would not try to tell you what to do or how to do it or when to do it. But we pray above all things that you'll capture her soul, Lord. And I pray, oh God, you'll redeem her and bring her back. And hear the prayers of this righteous man. Oh God, hear the fervent prayers of this family on behalf of Brother Jim Douly's sister. And we want to remember another one tonight, Lord, of Brother Nathaniel Johnson's wife in Tucson, Sister Margaret, I believe her name is. Oh, God. And Sister Lorie Snow has is so burdened for her. It's like second parents to her and Lord of family that they've been together all of these years. And to see this woman has yet many years of life before her. I pray, oh God, that you would reach down into into her very body, into the into the very places that need virtue and let your virtue cause the cancer cells to die. For your prophet said nothing would stand before his prayers, not even cancer, identifying that demon. We rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ. God, drive it from her body. I pray raise her up, Lord. And I pray you'll bring a bring a a a fountain of encouragement to our brother Nathaniel. Lord, pray you'll lift him up. This son of God, this minister of the gospel, oh Lord, come and bear his burden, I pray. And to come and attend to them this evening, I ask in Jesus Christ's name. And for those that enjoy good health, we want to thank you for we thank you for your word that has been brought to us. We thank you for your your message, Lord. and the messenger and to allow us to see the things that we see. I pray dear Lord you'll just receive our thanksgiving from the depths of our heart in Jesus Christ's name. We want to glorify you &gt;&gt; and we do glorify you. There's none like you. There's none like you. Be praised amongst us. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The only thing I can think of, Linda, is my This world is not my home. This world is not my home. I'm just a passing through. My treasures are laid out somewhere beyond the angels me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. I have no friend like you and a heaven's not my home. What will I do? The angels back to me from heaven's open door and I can't see my heart in this world anymore. They're all expecting me. And that's one thing I know. I fix it up with Jesus many years ago. I know you see me through though I weak and poor and I can't in this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. And if heaven stop my home, then what will I do? The angels said to me, my heavens open door and I can't be left in this world anymore. Just over in glory land. We live eternally. The saints on every hand are shining victory back from heaven shore and I can't feel at all. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. And if heaven is not my home, then what would I do? The angels beckon me. Heaven's open door and I can't feel at home in this world anymore. I want to ask this congregation. [Music] Don't feel embarrassed if you don't raise your hand. I'm not asking for a show of hands as such. I'd like to know in this congregation, how many are there that have someone [Music] that not just weighs upon your heart, but someone who's constantly constantly on your heart that you know is not saved, not prepared to go. And you're praying for them. You're holding them. You've held them for a long time and you continue to hold them before God. How many are there? Look how many men and women there are. Look how many souls there are. Perhaps someone that you're mention. And even if you don't mention, you're holding it before God. You're just praying for them all the time. Don't you think for a moment that our Lord Jesus very pleased for that? That you're holding him before him. God saw that. God saw that. Wonderful. This is the body of Christ here on earth. were holding some before the kingdom of God. I want to take a step further. I'm thinking of one right now. We pray for him all the time. I'm going to take another step. I believe I'm going to walk on the shores and the hills of glory with that individual. I'm praying with you want to take that step of faith also. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This isn't excitement. This is having some faith in the promise of God. He has spoken it and now we are going to believe it and hold fast to it. Father, you see these hands, not for ourselves, but we have held these before you. We've held these souls, each one worth 10,000 worlds. We hold them before you, oh God. We bear them before you, and we announce to Satan into his kingdom of darkness that we do not know at what moment, but he must turn them loose. The price of the blood of Jesus Christ has already been paid. Their souls have been purchased. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The anointed word has been spoken. The head of the serpent has been crushed. &gt;&gt; And the seed of the woman has come. &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, you've presented yourself in our time. Now here you're present now to fulfill the word in Jesus Christ's name. May they be loosed. Oh God, the ones that are being held and the hands that have been raised. Oh Lord, save these sons, these daughters, these fathers and mothers, and these children. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, let this congregation, Lord, have a faith that's been loosed. loosed by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh God, this enemy, this enemy, these habits that hold them or control them. It may be drugs, it may be alcohol. It could be any other habit of life, but those are only attributes of the unbelief. Bring their souls to believe. I pray cause their soul to be pricricked. Holy Spirit, penetrate, I pray, the very room that they're in. They may be sitting watching television. Let them become disinterested. [Music] Let sleep leave their eyes. Oh God, may they toss and turn and may they be reminded that their soul hangs over hell and darkness. Oh God, Lord, &gt;&gt; and that they'll turn and call upon the name of the Lord. And may something that has been spoken to them come to their remembrance now. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, we thank you for it. Thank you for hearing us now, Lord. And we will go treasuring their promise that you've given us. We ask you to bless this congregation, Lord, and dismiss us with abundant grace. I pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Amazing [Music] how sweet the sound. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I [Music] [Music] see &gt;&gt; when we've been there 10,000 years away [Music] 10,000 Heat. Heat. [Music] We know that sing.
