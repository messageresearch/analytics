[4:52] God

[9:19] Oh

[10:55] you
[11:03] my anchor
[11:06] my
[11:10] you
[11:15] hallelujah The battle is the Lord's.
[11:18] There is a source in time of need. How
[11:22] many have ever gone through a battle?
[11:23] Gone through a storm, but you've reached
[11:26] beyond the veil. There is a source. If
[11:28] you haven't reached beyond that veil, I
[11:30] challenge you this morning.
[11:32] There's a source in time of healing.
[11:35] If you have chains this morning, just
[11:38] press against him a little bit and ask
[11:40] him to come and break those chains. He's
[11:42] faithful. The songs have meaning.
[11:45] something to a believer. It's beyond the
[11:48] flesh. Amen. Let's sing this together
[11:50] this morning.
[11:53] There is a soul
[11:58] in time of need
[12:02] that gives me
[12:07] that brings me
[12:19] My go
[12:23] stand there in my defense.
[12:30] Where you are
[12:39] strength is
[12:43] and your heart is
[12:47] And we're
[12:51] gone.
[12:59] The battle is
[13:05] where
[13:09] he calls my name.
[13:15] Oh,
[13:22] he
[13:28] should
[13:43] be I Yeah.

[15:22] Heat.
[15:46] Take her home.
[15:52] Remember God. Take her
[16:00] soul.
[16:03] Take her.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; I'm sure Samson reached back and he
[16:11] said, "Remember God.
[16:20] Take her home.
[16:24] The battle is the Lord.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; In your trial this morning, remember
[16:30] God.
[16:32] He is greater than the soul.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No weapon. No weapon formed
[16:54] against you.
[16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:55] &gt;&gt; No weapon formed against this bride
[16:58] shall prosper.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. I
[17:03] trust that you feel encouraged in the
[17:05] Lord.
[17:06] Amen. He is faithful. We don't come
[17:09] because we have problems. We come
[17:11] because he has called us. Trials of this
[17:14] life, they grow strangely dim in his
[17:16] presence.
[17:18] Amen. Brother Peter, happy birthday.
[17:24] Amen.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Team number four,
[17:36] we love you, brother Peta. One more
[17:39] chemo treatment, right? That's a good
[17:41] birthday present.
[17:44] God's victorious
[17:46] through it all. We've learned to trust
[17:50] in Jesus through it all.
[17:54] Amen. By the things that he suffered. If
[17:57] he could learn all of that, what more
[17:59] can we learn through the things that we
[18:01] suffer?
[18:03] Amen. I'm going to ask Brother Tim,
[18:04] Brother Tim Dodd, if you'd come. We have
[18:07] several prayer requests to remember
[18:08] before the congregation this morning.
[18:10] Sister Eleanor Drake gives us a
[18:12] testimony to thank the Lord for and
[18:15] thank the saints for all their prayers
[18:17] for Sister Helen Bilisberger. The family
[18:19] is very much amazed at how well her
[18:22] progress has been made in such a short
[18:24] time. Please continue to pray as she
[18:26] still has a long way to go
[18:28] and um sorry still no visitors at this
[18:32] time. Praise God for the power of
[18:34] prayer. Amen. Thank you, Sister Eleanor,
[18:37] for that testimony this morning. Um,
[18:40] brother Hugh and sister Sylvia have a
[18:42] request for their daughter. It's in the
[18:44] hospital with um,
[18:47] uh, looks like a blood clot. So, we just
[18:50] want to remember it's a very serious
[18:52] need. Please pray for her. Have a
[18:55] request from Sister Patty Pettingale,
[18:58] Sister Kayla, who are both homesick
[19:00] today, asking for prayer from the
[19:02] congregation. A senior pastor has
[19:05] requested prayer for his wife. This is
[19:07] from brother John. Uh he lost a daughter
[19:10] to cancer 5 years ago and now his wife
[19:14] has been diagnosed with breast cancer
[19:15] and just asking that the Lord would be
[19:17] merciful to her and that our
[19:19] congregation would pray. My
[19:21] mother-in-law, Sister Joanne Savory is
[19:24] requesting prayer for herself. She has
[19:26] diverticulitis and is in a lot of pain
[19:28] and discomfort. Just asking that the
[19:30] Lord would touch her. Desires not to go
[19:33] for surgery. God's been merciful in our
[19:35] family over many years. She had um
[19:38] appendicitis. The doctor was ready to go
[19:41] in for surgery and just after she got
[19:43] saved and she said, "Just check one more
[19:45] time."
[19:46] &gt;&gt; The doctor went in and checked and he
[19:48] said, "How did you get a brand brand new
[19:50] append appendix? It looks like a
[19:53] newborn's." Amen. That's our God.
[19:56] &gt;&gt; He can do things just like that. So,
[19:58] she's just asking one more time. Amen.
[20:01] And if you have a need upon your heart
[20:03] as we go to prayer this morning, Brother
[20:05] Tim
[20:15] physical needs this morning
[20:18] certainly
[20:20] our burden for those you know the body
[20:23] is not just a local body. It's a
[20:25] international worldwide body and there
[20:28] are many needs. We are a needy body. As
[20:31] long as we're in these mortal bodies,
[20:32] we'll be a needy body. We're looking
[20:35] forward to a body change.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; And uh God is doing great things to get
[20:40] his bride ready for that. And I before
[20:42] we go to prayer, I just want to say that
[20:44] we've just published the latest edition
[20:46] of the believers faith challenge report.
[20:50] And it will be hitting the mail this
[20:51] week. Thanks to brother Matthew and his
[20:53] outreach group. They'll be doing a uh
[20:56] work effort this week to put it in the
[20:58] mail. We mail thousands of these uh
[21:01] around the world and the people that are
[21:03] interested in them and you can get your
[21:05] copy before anybody else does. They're
[21:07] on the back table by the office and uh
[21:10] there's some unique articles in here. We
[21:13] have one. We were actually hoping to
[21:15] have brother Jason Jackson with us from
[21:17] Arkansas here just last month, but he
[21:20] got uh pulled aside because of the
[21:22] hurricane that they had down there in
[21:24] Florida. And he went to have some meet
[21:26] with some and help some family members.
[21:28] Um but he helped us to put an article
[21:31] together of the impact of his church
[21:35] sponsoring a print station in Angola.
[21:38] And that is such a a unique article.
[21:40] You'll want to read that personally. It
[21:42] has had a huge impact on their church. I
[21:44] won't I won't uh give you any spoilers
[21:47] as they say. Uh the Uganda what's
[21:50] happening in Uganda is in here. Uh
[21:53] usually we publish one or two pages uh
[21:57] per we could say project or per item in
[22:01] Ug for Uganda. We went to four pages in
[22:04] this in this magazine. and and there's a
[22:07] lot of detail and pictures in there that
[22:08] you'll enjoy reading about. China and
[22:10] what's happening in China and some of
[22:12] the details brother Murphy couldn't
[22:14] necessarily share over the internet.
[22:16] They're in there in the faith challenge
[22:18] report. Greetings from our pastor.
[22:20] What's happening on the message of many
[22:22] other things you want to get your copy
[22:25] and you'll be inspired by it. That's why
[22:26] it's called the faith challenge report.
[22:29] It'll challenge your faith.
[22:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want our faith challenged. You
[22:33] know, faith has to have a challenge
[22:36] &gt;&gt; in order to operate.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; If there's no need, there's no need for
[22:39] faith.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; And but we thank God that he challenges
[22:44] us and puts a pressure to our faith, but
[22:47] he gives us the faith to overcome the
[22:49] challenge.
[22:51] &gt;&gt; And let's believe together uh not just
[22:53] for what's happening overseas, but let's
[22:56] believe together this morning as we
[22:57] pray, especially for these individual
[23:00] needs. I don't know if you felt that way
[23:02] as brother Derek was reading them. I
[23:05] felt that these were people that really
[23:06] needed a touch from God. And let's bow
[23:09] our heads together. And if you need also
[23:11] need a touch from God, have a desire in
[23:13] your heart, why don't you just make that
[23:15] known before the Lord.
[23:18] &gt;&gt; Oh wonderful heavenly father,
[23:21] you are our God.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; We are your people. We are not ashamed
[23:26] to be called your people, oh Lord. We
[23:30] are called Mrs. Jesus Christ. We are
[23:33] called after the name above every name.
[23:37] We've been baptized in that name. We
[23:40] have been saved by faith in that name.
[23:44] And we have been cleansed by the blood
[23:46] that flowed from that vessel. And Lord,
[23:48] we thank you this morning that we could
[23:50] come to you. Father, in the name of
[23:53] Jesus Christ, we're desiring, Lord,
[23:55] we're a people in need. We give
[23:57] testimony, Lord, for your goodness
[23:59] amongst us. We give testimony for your
[24:01] goodness to brother Peter, oh God. We
[24:04] thank you for him, oh Lord. And we pray,
[24:06] Lord, you'll continue to strengthen and
[24:08] heal him. Lord, continue to guide the
[24:11] doctor's hands as he endures the
[24:14] radiation treatment for the sake of his
[24:17] family, his loved ones. Oh God, we pray
[24:19] your quickening upon his mortal body. We
[24:22] remember Sister Helen this morning. Oh
[24:24] God, she's improving. And Lord, we're
[24:27] believing for a full improvement. That
[24:29] as long as she has life on the earth,
[24:31] that she will also have health and
[24:33] strength. Lord, we commit her into your
[24:36] hands. Oh God, these other needs that
[24:38] are represented here, Brother Hugh's
[24:41] request, the other request for a pastor
[24:44] and his wife. Lord Jesus, you're the
[24:46] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[24:49] Lord, you suffered at Calvary those
[24:51] stripes that we might be healed. And we
[24:53] pray that the healing virtue that was
[24:55] loosed at Calvary would be poured out
[24:57] upon these requests this morning. Lord,
[25:00] may you go to them each and everyone
[25:01] individually. And Lord, may you do a
[25:04] supernatural work within their lives,
[25:06] loosing them, breaking the power of the
[25:09] enemy, liberating the captives, oh God,
[25:12] lifting up the downtrodden, unbburdening
[25:15] the burdened, oh God. Lord, in each and
[25:18] every one that has a need, we desire,
[25:21] Lord, that you'll just come by our way
[25:23] this morning. We're praying for
[25:25] ourselves. We're praying for loved ones.
[25:27] We're praying, oh God, believing that
[25:30] even as you have promised it in your
[25:32] word, it shall be, Lord, for you cannot
[25:36] break your word. We love you, Lord. We
[25:40] thank you that you've called us to serve
[25:41] you. We thank you for this service this
[25:44] morning. Thank you that our pastor is
[25:46] going to come and minister the word this
[25:48] morning. We pray Lord you'd anoint him
[25:50] with a double portion. Lord, you'll
[25:53] strengthen his hand, Lord. That you'll
[25:55] give him that divine inspiration that
[25:57] only comes from your presence. And as we
[26:00] take up an offering this morning, we ask
[26:02] that Lord, you receive it as a form of
[26:04] worship. We give it unto you in worship
[26:07] this morning. May you bless it and use
[26:09] it for the glor glory of the name of
[26:11] Jesus Christ for the furtherance of the
[26:14] kingdom of God.
[26:16] We want to say Lord that we love you
[26:19] &gt;&gt; and thank you for your grace in our
[26:21] lives and we commit this service and all
[26:23] of these needs to you in the wonderful
[26:26] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning as you have
[26:34] your seats.
[26:39] Amen.
[26:43] Amen. How many enjoyed the special that
[26:45] Brother Victor sang on Wednesday night?
[26:48] Amen. I really appreciated that. I asked
[26:49] Brother Victor if it wouldn't be too
[26:51] much trouble if he could sing that for
[26:52] us again this morning. I think that'd be
[26:54] real nice. Brother Victor, if you'd come
[26:56] and get ready, that would be wonderful.
[27:00] We have a baby announcement here amongst
[27:02] my papers.
[27:05] I I tried not to hide it. Here it is.
[27:08] David and Linda Adamora are happy to
[27:11] announce the arrival of their baby girl,
[27:13] Joanna Adamora. Is she precious?
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[27:19] Amen.
[27:25] She was born on November 18th at 11:59
[27:28] a.m. Brother Victor, you might as well
[27:30] come on up. that they won't even notice
[27:32] you if that baby picture's up there.
[27:35] She weighed six pounds and 12 ounces.
[27:37] Mother and baby are doing outstanding.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And grandparents are happy.
[27:45] I'm sure they are. We have young
[27:47] people's on Friday night at 7:30 in the
[27:51] fellowship room. And brother Michael
[27:53] Andy's wanted me to make sure that I
[27:55] remind the young people that it's press
[27:56] the mark and it's starting right at
[27:58] 7:30. So, you don't want to come in at
[28:00] 7:40 hoping that they're done singing.
[28:03] Uh cuz you'll already be late. So, make
[28:05] sure you get there about 7:15 so they
[28:07] can get everything set up and have
[28:09] everything going speedily at 7:30. Sound
[28:12] good?
[28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. We'll
[28:15] invite our pastor to come just after
[28:17] brother Victor's done singing.
[28:37] Beloved, now we are
[28:42] the sons
[28:44] of God,
[28:46] adopted by his blood. We've been
[28:51] redeemed.
[28:54] We've been made joint hes with Jesus
[29:00] and to reign as kings and priests.
[29:04] Tell me, what do we say
[29:08] to these things?
[29:11] If God is for
[29:15] us,
[29:19] tell me who can be against
[29:24] us.
[29:27] If God is on our side,
[29:36] how can we be denied?
[29:44] In all these things,
[29:49] we are
[29:52] more than coner
[29:55] through Jesus
[29:57] Christ
[29:59] our Lord.
[30:04] Nothing can separate
[30:08] us from the love
[30:12] of God.
[30:19] Oh, we are told that God is working
[30:24] everything
[30:26] for our good
[30:28] if we promise to love him and do his
[30:33] will.
[30:36] And though the enemy tries to harm us,
[30:41] still the song our heart should sing.
[30:45] Now tell me what do we say
[30:49] to these things?
[30:51] If God is for
[30:56] us,
[30:59] tell me who can be against
[31:04] us.
[31:08] If God is on our side,
[31:15] how can we be denied?
[31:24] In all these things
[31:28] we are
[31:30] we are more than conerors
[31:34] through Jesus
[31:36] Christ
[31:38] our Lord.
[31:41] And
[31:43] nothing can separate
[31:47] us from the love
[31:50] of God.
[31:57] in joy
[32:00] and triumph
[32:02] or even your time of trouble.
[32:06] There's nothing to compare
[32:10] with the glory that's in store.
[32:15] For be it for thy sake, we stand
[32:19] justified
[32:20] by faith and will be glorified in him
[32:25] forever more.
[32:30] Sing it with me. If God is for
[32:36] us,
[32:39] tell me who can be against
[32:44] us.
[32:48] If God is on our side,
[32:55] how can we be denied?
[33:04] In all these things
[33:08] we are
[33:11] more than conquerors
[33:14] through Jesus
[33:16] Christ
[33:18] our Lord.
[33:21] And
[33:22] nothing can seeparate
[33:26] us from the love of God. Let's sing it
[33:31] one more time.
[33:35] If God is for
[33:40] us,
[33:43] tell me who can be.
[33:47] No situation, no circumstance,
[33:50] no sickness. God is on our side.
[33:59] How can we be denied?
[34:07] In all these things, we are
[34:15] more than coner through Jesus
[34:20] Christ
[34:21] our Lord.
[34:24] And
[34:26] nothing can seeparate
[34:30] us from the love of God.
[34:38] Nothing can seeparate
[34:42] us from the love
[34:45] of God.
[34:48] And
[34:50] nothing
[34:52] can seeparate
[34:55] us from the love
[34:59] of God.
[35:11] Amen. Brother Victor, thank you so very
[35:14] much. As our pastor comes this morning,
[35:17] we can sing blessed assurance.
[35:21] Nothing can separate us that gives us
[35:23] blessed assurance.
[35:25] Amen. And God bless you each and
[35:27] everyone this morning and welcome those
[35:29] that have joined with us on the internet
[35:32] today and ask that you be blessed in the
[35:35] service as we're blessed in his presence
[35:37] this morning. We appreciated this
[35:38] service Wednesday night. Brother Ernie,
[35:40] thank you for ministering. Amen. We
[35:43] enjoy the gifts that God's given us in
[35:46] this body.
[35:49] Blessed asssurance,
[35:54] Jesus is mine.
[35:59] Oh, what a
[36:04] glory
[36:10] of salvation.
[36:13] I'm virtious of God
[36:19] for his
[36:24] washing his blood.
[36:29] This is my story.
[36:33] This is my song.
[36:38] Praising my savior
[36:43] all the day.
[36:48] This is my soul.
[36:52] This is my song.
[36:57] Praising my savior
[37:02] all
[37:07] perfect
[37:21] on my side.
[37:24] I see angels. save
[37:28] me and break from
[37:36] your mercy.
[37:39] You whisper.
[37:44] This is my story.
[37:49] This is my song.
[37:53] Praising my savior
[37:58] all the way.
[38:03] This is my soul.
[38:07] This is my song.
[38:12] Praising myior.
[38:22] God bless you.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; This is my story also
[38:27] &gt;&gt; all the day long.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; But I have another story I'd like to
[38:32] just sing a wee bit about. He came to me
[38:36] &gt;&gt; when I could not go to him. He came to
[38:39] me and I trust that would be your
[38:42] experience today. I stood right about
[38:46] where Tom is sitting and we were
[38:49] singing. He came to me. I remember even
[38:52] looking up in the balcony over to this
[38:54] side. I don't know why. I just looked
[38:56] over there and I I said, "Yes, you came
[39:00] to me.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; You came to me in my element.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; You came to me in in the wilderness as
[39:08] it were
[39:10] &gt;&gt; and you came to me there. You came to me
[39:12] in a prophet
[39:14] &gt;&gt; and you answered many questions. Yes,
[39:18] &gt;&gt; you came to me.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; And I'd like you if you would stand if
[39:21] you wouldn't mind and just sing that.
[39:24] And I'd like your thought to be upon
[39:29] that very thought.
[39:31] Perhaps this is the moment he would just
[39:34] come to me in a special way.
[39:37] So let's just sing it.
[39:48] He
[39:54] when I
[39:59] where he was.
[40:02] He ra
[40:25] to where he was.
[40:28] He came to me.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; I'll have you sing it. I'll have you
[40:34] sing it once again with me. And rather
[40:37] than sing it like a lullaby,
[40:41] we'll sing it like a song,
[40:44] like a putting words to your putting
[40:47] music to your words. He came to me.
[40:53] He came to me
[40:56] &gt;&gt; when I could not come
[40:59] &gt;&gt; to where he was. He came to me.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Sing it like a
[41:06] like an event in your life.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Would you do maybe you want to close
[41:10] your eyes and just think about that? I'm
[41:13] just wanting to create that kind of an
[41:15] atmosphere.
[41:17] Second, brother
[41:25] He came
[41:27] to me
[41:32] when I could come
[41:36] to where he was.
[41:39] He came
[41:45] and that's my
[41:51] I am
[41:58] when I
[42:01] to
[42:04] he'll
[42:09] just pray a moment, please. Our heavenly
[42:12] father,
[42:15] &gt;&gt; we're indebted forever.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, we are. Then you came to us when
[42:20] you came. Our life was changed.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Our life was transformed by the
[42:27] transforming power which we could not
[42:30] even begin to comprehend. But you have
[42:33] done it. And we've gathered here this
[42:35] morning for various reasons. Perhaps
[42:39] some say, "Well, it's Sunday and we
[42:41] always go to church." But may it be more
[42:44] than that.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. May it become a time when we come
[42:48] and speak to you and you speak to us.
[42:52] May it be a time, oh God, that this will
[42:55] be a house of prayer, a house of
[42:58] communicating with you, heavenly father,
[43:01] bless your word now. and and we pray
[43:04] that we'll be worthy to read your words.
[43:09] Things that you've spoken, things that
[43:12] were in your heart, things that you had
[43:15] intended shall be and they shall be. Oh
[43:19] God, whether we see it or do not see it,
[43:22] they shall be. Thy will be done on earth
[43:25] as it is in heaven.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; We speak, oh Lord, to you as our father.
[43:31] We pray your will be done in Jesus name.
[43:34] Amen.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Anoint us Lord we pray.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Well you enjoyed I'm sure brother
[43:47] Dodd's comments about
[43:49] Faith Challenge report.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Well I haven't read it yet.
[43:54] I'm certainly going to read it.
[43:58] And uh I trust you'll be blessed this
[44:00] week as you ponder the things that God
[44:04] has for us.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; May this Sunday be uh a Sunday that we
[44:10] different from others. I just pray that
[44:12] you will have a testimony such as I had
[44:15] just a moment ago. I maybe just said it
[44:18] quickly. I was standing where brother
[44:20] Tom is sitting and I was standing and I
[44:23] was just singing. He came to me.
[44:26] It was just another chorus.
[44:29] But that day it was a different chorus.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; That day it was different words.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; And I don't even know if the author of
[44:37] the song
[44:38] &gt;&gt; felt what I felt.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Thought that day he came. You remember
[44:44] when he looked at you,
[44:45] &gt;&gt; saw you, what did he see in you?
[44:48] &gt;&gt; And so I I pray that today will be a
[44:51] blessed time in his presence.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:56] Amen.
[44:59] I'll have you take your Bible and
[45:02] because I'm going to
[45:06] uh be speaking from I'm going to speak
[45:09] from the old creation and the new
[45:13] creation,
[45:15] our first birth and our second birth.
[45:19] And why believers, even believers, have
[45:22] a lot of trouble, have a lot of
[45:24] difficulty because we're living in both
[45:27] places at the same time.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; That's and Brother Ernie, you laid a
[45:32] wonderful foundation for that on
[45:35] Wednesday. It was really wonderful.
[45:37] Someone was asking me, I was smiling. Of
[45:40] course, I was smiling through the whole
[45:42] time. I just enjoyed I enjoyed the word
[45:46] real a whole lot is what I'll say. And
[45:50] uh a few a few weeks ago, brother Tom
[45:55] preached a series and I don't know if
[45:58] you caught it as in a series, but I we
[46:02] started on the theme, hear ye him.
[46:06] And then the second service he spoke on
[46:12] uh those that heard him said, "But
[46:15] blessed are your ears for they hear for
[46:19] the things they hear and your eyes for
[46:22] the things a lot of people could see
[46:24] physically,
[46:27] but they weren't seeing
[46:29] &gt;&gt; what they were given to see." And then I
[46:33] think the third service was, and you'll
[46:36] just forgive me Tom if I'm not exactly
[46:38] on quue here, but I think the third
[46:41] service was that uh you could see and
[46:47] you could hear.
[46:49] Even if you wanted to, you could see and
[46:51] hear only by his grace and by his
[46:55] predestinated.
[46:57] And you'll only see and hear
[47:00] what you hunger and really hunger after
[47:04] &gt;&gt; today.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Uh it it won't come. It's God's not
[47:08] going to force it down your throat.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; It's something you will need to hunger
[47:13] for. You desire for. You think about it.
[47:17] You ponder it.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; And you think about his greatness and
[47:20] your unworthiness. and when you see
[47:23] things in the in the light that they
[47:26] really are. And I'm just seeking to
[47:28] prepare you for what I have further to
[47:31] say.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then in that third service
[47:38] uh the last service at least whether it
[47:41] was the third or fourth service it was
[47:44] that
[47:45] we uh
[47:48] we are predestinated to a certain
[47:51] purpose
[47:53] and God does he opens our eyes causes us
[47:58] to see causes us to hear
[48:02] because it is to direct our life in a
[48:06] certain pre-planned direction
[48:10] and God has his intent in fact is that's
[48:14] why you were perhaps some of you may be
[48:17] born in the home you were born in he
[48:20] wanted you to hear certain things
[48:22] perhaps others of you worked with
[48:25] someone who you worked with a a
[48:27] colleague or you ran into somebody and
[48:31] they just casually said something to you
[48:34] and it just that was different
[48:37] &gt;&gt; and you followed on or you got invited
[48:40] to church.
[48:42] This this is a church. It's not a church
[48:45] church.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; This is just a building that we come we
[48:49] come to hear the word of God.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; We come to let the Holy Spirit have his
[48:55] way.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; And that's the whole desire. And failing
[49:00] that, we fail completely. There's all
[49:03] kinds of churches, all kinds of
[49:06] buildings. They're monuments
[49:09] is what they are.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; And we don't want this to be just a
[49:12] monument. We don't want this just to be
[49:14] a formality. If this is just a formality
[49:17] to you, ask the Holy Spirit, "Jar me
[49:20] from that."
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. jar me out of that
[49:23] &gt;&gt; and let me know that I'm here for a
[49:26] divine purpose
[49:28] &gt;&gt; for to meet a divi have a divine meeting
[49:32] &gt;&gt; with the holy one of Israel.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[49:38] Now with I'll just have you take your
[49:40] Bibles if you would. If you don't have a
[49:43] Bible, share it with the one right next
[49:44] to you
[49:47] because I'd like you to read from John
[49:50] the uh 17th chapter
[49:53] and the 11th to the 16th verse.
[49:57] And while you're turning, I might as
[50:00] well say this to you because it came to
[50:02] my mind today and I said, "Father, let
[50:06] me be worthy to read these words."
[50:10] This is not just some printed words on a
[50:13] page.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; This is the prayer.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Of Jesus Christ.
[50:20] We're not worthy to even read it.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Cause uses to be worthy.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; And it's a conversation
[50:29] earlier in John. Jesus had a
[50:32] conversation with Nicodemus.
[50:35] And we will turn to that just after.
[50:40] I'm going to
[50:43] turn this on so you can read it.
[50:48] And now I am no more in the world. I'd
[50:52] like you to notice the word in the
[50:55] world, but these are in the world.
[51:00] And I come to thee, holy father,
[51:03] keep through thine own name those whom
[51:06] thou hast given me, that they may be one
[51:10] as we are.
[51:13] While I was with them in the world, I
[51:17] kept them in thy name. Those that thou
[51:21] gavest me, I have kept,
[51:24] and none of them is lost, but the son of
[51:27] predition, that the scripture might be
[51:30] fulfilled.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; And now I come to thee,
[51:35] and these things I speak in the world,
[51:40] that they might have my joy fulfilled in
[51:44] themselves.
[51:45] Not his not a distress
[51:49] &gt;&gt; but a joy fulfilled in themselves.
[51:53] Not something hilarious or jovial as
[51:56] such but a deep settled joy.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Verse 14. I have given them thy word
[52:04] and the world hath hated them because
[52:08] they are not of the world. And I would
[52:11] like you to notice now the word of O.
[52:14] They are not of the world. They haven't
[52:18] proceeded from the world. They may have
[52:21] gone through the school system. They may
[52:23] have gone through further education, but
[52:25] they're not of the world. They may earn
[52:28] a living there and survive and raise a
[52:31] family, but they're not of the world.
[52:34] They're not a product of the world.
[52:39] and the world hath hated them,
[52:42] &gt;&gt; and they are not of the world, even as I
[52:45] am not of the world. I pray that thou
[52:50] shouldest take them. I pray not that
[52:53] thou shouldest take them out of the
[52:56] world, but that thou shouldest keep them
[52:59] from the evil.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; They are not of the world, even as I am
[53:05] not of the world.
[53:08] verse 16.
[53:11] And I'm going to turn back to uh in
[53:15] John's gospel
[53:18] to uh John the 3 chapter
[53:22] and I just want to read a couple of
[53:24] verses
[53:28] uh starting John 3
[53:31] and the third verse. Jesus answered and
[53:35] said unto him, that was Nicodemus,
[53:38] verily, verily, I say unto thee, except
[53:42] a man be born again,
[53:45] he cannot see the kingdom of God. So
[53:48] this is another birth. Except a man be
[53:51] born again,
[53:54] except a man be born again, he cannot
[53:57] see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus sth
[54:01] unto him, "How can a man be born when
[54:05] he's old? Can he enter the second time
[54:09] into his mother's womb and be born?" And
[54:12] I want to answer, "No, he couldn't."
[54:15] Because
[54:16] if he
[54:19] with the birth that he had entered into
[54:21] the second second time into his mother's
[54:23] womb and was born, it would still be
[54:26] flesh.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; It would still be death. it would still
[54:30] be sinful. And I'll talk about that in
[54:32] just a moment. So Jesus answered, verse
[54:35] 5, Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I
[54:39] say unto thee, except a man be born of
[54:43] water and of the spirit, he cannot enter
[54:48] into the kingdom of God." God bless you.
[54:51] You may be seated.
[54:56] Now, we had our first birth.
[54:59] And that's why we're here.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; You're all here.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; And uh you have a a father and a mother
[55:08] someplace,
[55:12] but you were born in sin
[55:15] and you were shaped in iniquities
[55:18] and you came with a human nature
[55:22] and you came
[55:24] uh as a result of unbelief. You're the
[55:27] product of unbelief.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Eve disbelieved the word. Adam went to
[55:33] redeem her. And uh so the first birth,
[55:39] we're born in sin and shapen in
[55:41] iniquities.
[55:43] Secondly,
[55:45] we're born subject to pain,
[55:48] to disease, to sickness.
[55:52] You're born subject to those things. We
[55:55] have wars,
[55:58] all kinds of infirmities.
[56:01] And because of that birth,
[56:04] this birth that I'm speaking of now, the
[56:07] second birth,
[56:09] the second birth is the beginning of the
[56:12] creation of God. I'd like you to, if you
[56:15] have your Bible, if you just turn also
[56:18] to
[56:20] Revelation the 3 chapter.
[56:23] And I was very uh
[56:26] affected by this particular verse.
[56:45] Revelation the 3r chapter
[56:49] and the 14th verse.
[56:53] and unto the angel of the church of the
[56:56] leadyans.
[56:57] Write
[56:59] these things saith the amen.
[57:04] Now a few moments ago we were reading
[57:07] words that he spoke on earth
[57:10] spoke to mortal ears. There very few
[57:13] that will understand these words but now
[57:17] he's still speaking.
[57:20] And under the angel of the church of the
[57:22] leadyans, under the messenger
[57:26] &gt;&gt; of that church.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; He has a special message.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; And he didn't even say speak. He said
[57:35] write.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; These things saith the angel.
[57:40] These things saith the amen,
[57:43] the faithful and true witness,
[57:46] the beginning of the creation of God.
[57:50] This is the beginning of another
[57:52] creation.
[57:57] The beginning of the creation of God.
[58:01] It isn't that God failed in the first
[58:04] creation.
[58:05] God knew it was going to go that
[58:08] direction
[58:09] because we sit here in a body
[58:13] through that creation
[58:15] and we're all born in sin. I don't care
[58:18] how good you are. I don't care what
[58:20] you've believed. That has nothing to do
[58:22] with it. We are born in sin and shapen
[58:26] iniquities. And in this body, we will
[58:29] get older. We will get weaker. Brother
[58:33] Brandham even asked a man, he said, "Is
[58:36] it not true that as I eat food and it's
[58:41] digested in this body, he may not have
[58:43] used those words, but he said, "As I eat
[58:46] food and I eat vegetables and so on, I
[58:50] get stronger." Yes. He said, "That's
[58:52] that's correct. You get stronger.
[58:56] is because it's bringing blood cells
[58:59] into the bloodstream and you get
[59:02] stronger. He said, "Then how is it that
[59:05] I eat today, I still eat the same food,
[59:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:09] &gt;&gt; I still eat the same potatoes and eat
[59:11] the same meat and so on, but I get
[59:13] weaker."
[59:15] &gt;&gt; And the man didn't have an answer for
[59:17] him.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; He gets weaker. you get weaker
[59:21] &gt;&gt; eating the same food, but you don't
[59:24] regenerate the same as you do when
[59:27] you're younger. So, we have a mixed
[59:29] audience here today. We have some of you
[59:32] that are receiving the benefits of what
[59:36] you eat on that end. But gradually, as
[59:39] time goes on, you'll find that it it
[59:44] becomes more uh more weight than you
[59:48] want.
[59:49] Uh, it doesn't do what you want it to
[59:52] do. You I say I used to be able to
[59:54] always do this. I could always do this.
[59:57] Well, we don't anymore.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Sister Biscll sitting back there. She
[1:00:02] used to run like an antelope.
[1:00:04] Uh,
[1:00:06] today it's more difficult even to walk
[1:00:10] steady. Same thing with myself. And so
[1:00:14] that is one birth.
[1:00:17] And Jesus said to Nicodemus, "You must
[1:00:23] you must be born again.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; You cannot see the kingdom of God until
[1:00:29] you're born again."
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; It it isn't, friends, that you sit in
[1:00:33] this church or any other church. That
[1:00:36] will not give you the vision that you
[1:00:38] need to have. You can clean your glasses
[1:00:41] or do whatever you wish, but that
[1:00:44] doesn't give you the vision. You must be
[1:00:46] born again and then you shall see the
[1:00:49] kingdom of God.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Except a man be born again, he cannot
[1:00:55] see the kingdom of God. He cannot enter
[1:00:58] the kingdom of God.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you that this life that
[1:01:03] you're representing today, sitting in
[1:01:06] the seat that you're in will end.
[1:01:11] Then a prophet of God, his words will
[1:01:14] mean so much to you when his words and
[1:01:17] he spoke and said that that this life.
[1:01:21] Are you listening?
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; This life only changes
[1:01:25] the there's no change actually. You you
[1:01:28] and this life you step into another
[1:01:31] life. You just take one footstep as
[1:01:33] brother Ernie was describing to us on
[1:01:36] Wednesday night. And you take one step,
[1:01:39] it'll be in time. And you'll take
[1:01:42] another step and you'll be in eternity.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; If you're born again,
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Allow me just to read. I want to read
[1:01:56] something that I thought of you, brother
[1:01:58] Ken Andes, because
[1:02:02] you put so much meaning and depth
[1:02:06] to the church ages,
[1:02:09] and I really appreciate that.
[1:02:12] Brother Brandham says in the church ages
[1:02:22] just a moment please.
[1:02:26] It's in the Leodysian church age page
[1:02:30] 336.
[1:02:31] He says, "But now he is standing in the
[1:02:35] midst of his church." Speaking of
[1:02:37] Christ,
[1:02:38] as he stands there revealing who he is
[1:02:42] in this last age,
[1:02:45] he calls himself the author of the
[1:02:47] creation of God, which we just read. He
[1:02:51] calls himself the author of the creation
[1:02:54] of God. This is another creation.
[1:02:59] This has to do with the church. This is
[1:03:02] a special designation of himself.
[1:03:06] He is the creator.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; As John's gospel says, in the beginning
[1:03:12] was the word and the word was with God
[1:03:16] and the word was God. All things were
[1:03:20] made by him and without him was nothing
[1:03:23] made that is made.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; He created all things. So now he is
[1:03:28] saying this is another creation.
[1:03:32] This has to do with the church. In other
[1:03:34] words, he's going to create something.
[1:03:37] This is a special designation of
[1:03:40] himself. He is the creator of that
[1:03:43] church. The heavenly bridegroom created
[1:03:48] his own bride.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:52] As the spirit of God, as the spirit of
[1:03:55] God, he came down and created in the
[1:03:59] Virgin Mary the cells from which his
[1:04:03] body was born. I want to repeat that he
[1:04:08] created the very cells in the womb of
[1:04:11] Mary for that body.
[1:04:15] It was not enough for the Holy Spirit to
[1:04:19] simply give life to a human oam
[1:04:23] supplied by Mary. That would have been
[1:04:27] sinful mankind producing a body.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; That would not have produced the last
[1:04:34] Adam.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Are are you receiving this?
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Of him. It is it was said lo a body hast
[1:04:44] thou father hast thou prepared for me?
[1:04:50] God not Mary provided that body. Mary
[1:04:55] was the human incubator
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; and she carried that holy child and
[1:05:02] brought him to birth. It was a God man.
[1:05:07] He was the son of God. He was the new
[1:05:11] creation.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Man and God met and joined.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; He was Colossians 1:18.
[1:05:20] For he is the head of the body, the
[1:05:23] church who is the beginning, the
[1:05:26] firstborn from the dead. Hallelujah.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; And in and in all things, he might he
[1:05:34] might have the preeminence. 2
[1:05:37] Corinthians 5 and:17.
[1:05:40] Therefore, if any man be in Christ,
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; I I wish to have this on the slides, but
[1:05:47] I don't have it prepared for you.
[1:05:49] Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he
[1:05:52] is a new creation.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; You are a new creation. If any man be in
[1:06:00] Christ,
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; he is a new creation.
[1:06:04] Amen.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Old things have passed away and behold
[1:06:08] all things become new.
[1:06:11] There you can see that uh though man was
[1:06:15] of the old order
[1:06:18] or creation now in union with Christ and
[1:06:23] here's the key in union with Christ. He
[1:06:26] has become the new creation of God.
[1:06:30] Ephesians 2:10. For we are his
[1:06:33] workmanship,
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; created in union with Christ
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; unto good works. Ephesians 4 and 24. And
[1:06:42] that you might put on the new man.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; This is how you do it. Which after God
[1:06:50] is created in righteousness and true
[1:06:54] holiness, this new creation is not the
[1:06:58] old creation made over.
[1:07:00] or it could not be called a new
[1:07:03] creation.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; This is exactly what this this exactly
[1:07:08] what it says it is new creation. It is
[1:07:12] another creation distinct from the old
[1:07:15] one.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; No longer is he dealing by the ways of
[1:07:20] the flesh. This was this was how he
[1:07:25] dealt with Israel. He chose Abraham as a
[1:07:29] man of of of the flesh. And of Abraham's
[1:07:33] issue,
[1:07:35] see, God had promised him seed of
[1:07:38] Abraham's issue
[1:07:40] uh through the godly
[1:07:43] Isaac line.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; But now out of every kindred, tribe, and
[1:07:49] nation, he has pro proposed a new
[1:07:52] creation. He is the first of that that
[1:07:57] creation.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; He was God created in the form of man.
[1:08:02] Now by his spirit, he is creating many
[1:08:06] sons unto himself.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; God the creator creating himself a part
[1:08:13] of his creation. Isn't this wonderful?
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; This is the new revelation. This is the
[1:08:19] new revelation of God. This was his
[1:08:23] purpose. And then I have underlined and
[1:08:25] highlighted this purpose took form
[1:08:29] through election.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; And I could continue on, but I want to
[1:08:33] just stop there. You cannot supersede
[1:08:36] the election of God.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; You're sitting here by his election.
[1:08:42] You owe a debt to him
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; to thank him,
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; to worship him,
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; because he simply elected
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; that you'd be born in a certain place.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; I want to just speak about these two
[1:08:55] births for a moment. I've been pondering
[1:08:57] them for days, weeks. In fact,
[1:09:03] you that are mothers and fathers.
[1:09:07] Well, by with technology, maybe you
[1:09:10] didn't know it was a boy or a girl, but
[1:09:12] you knew very little. And and and that's
[1:09:15] not thanks to you. That's thanks to
[1:09:17] technology.
[1:09:19] Uh when my daughters were born, they
[1:09:21] wouldn't even let me go into the to the
[1:09:24] see where the children were.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; I was not permitted. I could only look
[1:09:29] at them through a glass. You say, "How
[1:09:31] horrible." Well, that's part of my life,
[1:09:34] right? That's a horrible part of my
[1:09:36] life. Yeah. I couldn't even see my
[1:09:39] daughters. I couldn't even see my
[1:09:40] children. That's, you know, for a
[1:09:43] husband to stand there, it's very
[1:09:45] humiliating. Yeah. It's my seed, but I
[1:09:47] can't even see them. I can't They got to
[1:09:50] put this glass between me and my child.
[1:09:53] And my wife is sitting there. our last
[1:09:57] daughter that is sitting here t today,
[1:10:00] Tom's wife, Joanne. Uh, I was working
[1:10:06] and so I raced home because I was going
[1:10:08] to fix myself something to eat real
[1:10:11] quick and run down to the hospital. And
[1:10:14] so I phoned nurse's station and I said,
[1:10:18] "How's Ruth Biscll?" She said, "She's
[1:10:21] about the same." I said, "Oh, okay,
[1:10:23] fine." I had lots of time. So about 25
[1:10:27] minutes later, I got a phone call and it
[1:10:30] was from the hospital. It was my wife
[1:10:32] was on the phone. I said, "Oh, hi. I I
[1:10:35] just talked with the nurses station."
[1:10:37] And uh she said, "Well, it's a girl."
[1:10:41] I said, "Oh, come on." I said, "I I I I
[1:10:45] know better. I've just talked to the
[1:10:47] nurse." And she said, "Everything's
[1:10:48] probably the same." No, she said, "It's
[1:10:50] a girl." I said, "You're kidding." And
[1:10:54] uh what I didn't know is that her father
[1:10:56] came in to see her and uh the bed was
[1:11:00] empty and uh there was another sister
[1:11:03] there that we knew and uh related by
[1:11:07] marriage and uh she and she was there.
[1:11:11] She said, "Well, I I think she maybe
[1:11:14] just went down to the washroom or
[1:11:15] something." So he said, "Well, I'll just
[1:11:17] go. There's another old-timer here. I'll
[1:11:19] go and visit him and then I'll come
[1:11:21] back." So he came back in about 20
[1:11:24] minutes or half an hour. He came back
[1:11:27] after little time of visiting and and
[1:11:29] she's in her bed and uh well he said I
[1:11:33] was just in here. She said well it's a
[1:11:35] girl and that was a shock to him as
[1:11:39] well. And so I I raced down to the
[1:11:41] hospital of course it was a girl
[1:11:45] and I had prayed because I had doubted
[1:11:48] my own prayer. I guess I prayed for a
[1:11:50] son and I said,
[1:11:54] "If it's a girl, just make it that they
[1:11:57] all can sing."
[1:12:01] And so that part of my request I got,
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; but the other part I didn't get. I I
[1:12:08] wanted a boy, but I never got a boy. I
[1:12:10] got three girls. All right, that's
[1:12:13] natural birth. But isn't it, isn't it
[1:12:16] incredible that something this dynamic,
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; something so lifechanging,
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; something that's going to change your
[1:12:25] entire home and your life at home and
[1:12:28] maybe your job and all of these things,
[1:12:31] you don't have anything to say about it,
[1:12:33] right?
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing?
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[1:12:39] something like this and I don't have
[1:12:40] anything to say about it. And I
[1:12:42] furthermore, you have nothing to say
[1:12:44] about their nature or their character
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; or what they're going to like or what
[1:12:49] they're going to dislike. You you have
[1:12:52] very little whether they've got skills
[1:12:54] or whether they're gifted. You don't
[1:12:56] know anything about it. You say, "Well,
[1:12:58] I'll I'll do everything I can." Well,
[1:13:01] you can do everything you can, but if
[1:13:02] the kid hasn't got it, they don't have
[1:13:04] it.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; You can't put it in them. Uh I know a
[1:13:09] little bit about that.
[1:13:12] I had I had one daughter, you know, I I
[1:13:14] have a lot of experience and I had one
[1:13:17] daughter and she would she would come
[1:13:19] and tap on my cheek at about 3:30 in the
[1:13:23] morning. Many many mornings.
[1:13:27] Yes, Marilyn. She'd be standing there in
[1:13:29] her little night gown and tapping and
[1:13:32] and she it was like a
[1:13:36] Chinese torture treatment I believe they
[1:13:38] have.
[1:13:40] and she would just tap on she would tap
[1:13:43] on there as long as it took for me to
[1:13:45] open my eyes and uh she couldn't say her
[1:13:48] Rs either at that time which is no
[1:13:51] surprise I couldn't say it till I was
[1:13:53] about eight but she would tap on my face
[1:13:57] and then when I'd open my eyes she'd say
[1:14:00] I need a pencil and a paper
[1:14:04] because she was going to be an artist
[1:14:06] someday
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; now you ought to see when she takes a
[1:14:09] pen in her hand and and and I sit there
[1:14:13] and say, "How do you know to do that?"
[1:14:16] Well, it was back there. I should have
[1:14:18] known when she was saying, "I need a
[1:14:20] pencil and a paper." That she was trying
[1:14:22] to tell me, "I got it in me and I have
[1:14:25] to do something about it. I need a
[1:14:28] pencil and a paper." So, I'd get up and
[1:14:31] get her a pencil and a paper.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; That was a natural birth.
[1:14:38] natural birth, as wonderful as it might
[1:14:40] be, we're born in sin and shaped in
[1:14:43] iniquities,
[1:14:44] regardless of how beautiful you are or
[1:14:47] how young you are or and and that has
[1:14:50] nothing to do with it. You're still
[1:14:52] going to get stooped over and you're
[1:14:54] still hair is going to turn white and
[1:14:55] you're still going to get wrinkled and
[1:14:58] and uh and shaky when you get older. If
[1:15:02] that happens, it's that that's this
[1:15:05] life. Thank God that there's a new
[1:15:07] birth.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Thank God there's another birth. It's
[1:15:11] not wishful thinking. It's not in our
[1:15:14] mind.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; And I want to talk about these two. Do I
[1:15:17] have a few minutes?
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; We have a second birth.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; The beginning of the creation of God.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; The beginning of the creation of God
[1:15:28] comes and washes away the deformities
[1:15:33] of the first birth. Amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; It's either a weaker birth or it's a
[1:15:38] stronger birth.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; And my conviction to you is it's a
[1:15:43] stronger birth.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; There's a light that comes within the
[1:15:46] body to this in this flesh in this
[1:15:52] beginning of the creation of God or this
[1:15:55] shall I say this old creation.
[1:15:58] And you know there's some light
[1:16:01] uh we have light.
[1:16:04] I don't know how to describe it exactly.
[1:16:06] We can say well because you can speak or
[1:16:09] because you can see or because well it
[1:16:12] it has a measure of light. But the
[1:16:14] second birth is a perfect light.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; The second birth your thinking will be
[1:16:20] correct.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; And your thinking will not be of doubt
[1:16:23] or unbelief.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; There's a complete change between the
[1:16:29] new birth
[1:16:30] second birth and the first birth.
[1:16:38] The beginning of the creation of God
[1:16:41] comes and washes away the deformities of
[1:16:45] sin
[1:16:47] and the mar
[1:16:50] of the effects of unbelief.
[1:16:52] You know, when the serpent and Eve had
[1:16:55] their initial conversation,
[1:16:58] it wasn't just what was spoken,
[1:17:02] but
[1:17:04] it was a displacement of headship.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; The Bible says clearly that she should
[1:17:13] have been able to go and talk to her
[1:17:14] husband,
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:17] But neither was he able to give her the
[1:17:20] kind of instruction that she needed.
[1:17:25] Uh
[1:17:28] I'm just thinking of something that I
[1:17:31] perhaps should say and I don't want to
[1:17:32] say but and I have said this over the
[1:17:36] pulpit here when brother Brandham speaks
[1:17:40] about the masterpiece
[1:17:42] and how Michelangelo struck that
[1:17:44] masterpiece when he finally saw it what
[1:17:48] was an image in his mind and he finally
[1:17:50] saw it there and he says he He may be
[1:17:54] pecked at it for years
[1:17:57] and someone maybe would say, "Why are
[1:18:00] you pecking at that? Why are you hitting
[1:18:03] that stone?" But when he finally saw the
[1:18:06] image
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; of what he had in his mind,
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; he thought it should speak to him
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; and he struck it on the knee
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; and made a mar. He marred the image and
[1:18:20] he said, "Speak."
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:18:23] because he thought it should speak to
[1:18:25] him.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; It looked so real. It was such a
[1:18:29] fulfillment of what he saw in his mind.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says, "And it could
[1:18:34] only take a prophet. You couldn't say
[1:18:36] this with human intellect." He said,
[1:18:39] "The mar is what made it the
[1:18:43] masterpiece." Amen.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; And we think now of the mar of the first
[1:18:50] birth
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; and we were marred.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; You can take a child out of a good home
[1:18:59] out of good Christian parents and put
[1:19:02] him up in the mountain where he'll never
[1:19:04] see any evil or never uh never contact
[1:19:08] anything. He won't see other peers of
[1:19:11] his of his age.
[1:19:14] dabbling in sinful things, but he'll
[1:19:17] still have a sinful nature.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; He'll still come against things that are
[1:19:23] right and pure and so on. And that's
[1:19:26] because he'll be he could be better. But
[1:19:29] the gospel didn't come to make people
[1:19:31] better.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:50] The prophet said in the message he swore
[1:19:53] by himself.
[1:19:55] He says in Jesus Christ
[1:19:58] formed from a blood cell
[1:20:02] and the outside shield of the cell
[1:20:05] itself
[1:20:07] which is billions times billion smaller
[1:20:11] than the human eye can see.
[1:20:15] But that was the body.
[1:20:18] The Lord Jesus inside of that was God
[1:20:22] himself
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; wrapped himself around the blood cell in
[1:20:27] order to take his own blood and to spill
[1:20:32] his own blood
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; or give it freely that we
[1:20:38] uh through the breaking of that blood
[1:20:40] cell to our to our mortal
[1:20:45] to our mortal when it when it breaks
[1:20:48] breaks and our life leaves from here to
[1:20:51] go out through the redemption of the
[1:20:56] blood that God required.
[1:20:59] We can we can be brought into that body
[1:21:03] and brought a part of God himself as a
[1:21:07] son of God. Brother, if you can digest
[1:21:10] that,
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; it'll sure do you good. Amen.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; I wish I had some way to just show you
[1:21:20] what it what what it is. Just think of
[1:21:24] God Jehovah coming down into the womb of
[1:21:28] a woman overshadowed
[1:21:30] come down in the in the uh down in the
[1:21:35] down to spirit and he's in them. Where
[1:21:39] is he? He's the creator himself.
[1:21:43] He made the very woman in the womb.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; He made the very woman in the womb that
[1:21:50] uh that he was in right then. God made I
[1:21:55] excuse me, but it's not always easy to
[1:21:58] easy to read exactly as the prophet
[1:22:00] speaks.
[1:22:03] God made himself little,
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; came down and got into his blood own
[1:22:09] into this blood cell
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; and his and he began to build something
[1:22:16] around him. What was it?
[1:22:20] He said when the Holy Ghost overshadowed
[1:22:23] her and put a blood cell in into her
[1:22:27] womb in creation,
[1:22:30] God the creator made that
[1:22:35] made that and and that came to be the
[1:22:39] son of God. Amen. Outside of believing
[1:22:43] that, you're lost. Right.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; All you could do, you have to believe
[1:22:49] that in order to be saved.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Now, here we have the beginning of the
[1:22:57] creation of God.
[1:23:05] I have a thought that I want to convey
[1:23:08] to you and I think that I'll just
[1:23:13] um speak it to you.
[1:23:18] Now I've established there is a new
[1:23:20] birth. There's an old birth and a new
[1:23:23] birth.
[1:23:24] I want this congregation to understand
[1:23:27] except ye be born again, you cannot
[1:23:31] enter the kingdom of God.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; You can do a lot with this.
[1:23:38] You can go shopping.
[1:23:40] You can go fix it up. You can get your
[1:23:43] hair cut.
[1:23:45] You men,
[1:23:47] you can look fine. You can go to the gym
[1:23:51] and all of that other stuff.
[1:23:54] But still one day you're going to lay on
[1:23:57] a cold slab.
[1:23:59] Whether you're a Bill Gates with 20 or
[1:24:02] 30 or 40 billion dollars,
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; just paper or where you're somebody
[1:24:08] who's in debt.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; You'll all lay on the slab and that's
[1:24:12] where you'll find common ground.
[1:24:16] when the ecumenical movement was moving
[1:24:20] and everybody was joining this and
[1:24:22] speaking in tongues and so on and so
[1:24:24] forth. I was in a house on Vancouver
[1:24:28] Island as a result of the radio
[1:24:30] broadcast
[1:24:32] and the family who's who owned that
[1:24:34] house there in brother Roger Smith's
[1:24:37] church in Abbottzford to this day
[1:24:41] and they invited me to come there and
[1:24:44] brother Amy Mulan. How many remembers
[1:24:46] brother Amy Mulan? Put your hands up
[1:24:48] high so he's not a stranger to the
[1:24:51] congregation. Brother Amy Mulan was in
[1:24:55] his brother was his brother in the
[1:24:57] flesh. He was a hopeless hopeless
[1:25:01] hopeless alcoholic.
[1:25:03] He was a good Catholic
[1:25:06] and he gave himself to go to Borneo
[1:25:10] and the islands in the South Sea to work
[1:25:14] on a gospel ship. He thought surely I
[1:25:17] will find peace with God and I will find
[1:25:22] freedom from this demon of alcohol.
[1:25:25] And he came to the knowledge of the
[1:25:27] message as a result of my visit over
[1:25:29] there. He wasn't there. He heard of it
[1:25:32] through his brother. But I remember they
[1:25:35] were seated on the floor. Started here,
[1:25:38] went around some in chairs.
[1:25:41] There was 22 people.
[1:25:44] And I said, I didn't know what to say
[1:25:46] really. I just came there as a visitor
[1:25:50] and I was looking to the Lord that I
[1:25:52] could say something of value.
[1:25:55] So I said, now I don't know you. You're
[1:25:59] all strangers to me.
[1:26:02] I said, this person over here may be
[1:26:04] Salvation Army. This one might be
[1:26:06] Catholic. And this one over here might
[1:26:07] be a Baptist.
[1:26:10] And I I went around. This may be
[1:26:13] Jehovah's Witness. this may be whatever.
[1:26:16] And I just named all the different
[1:26:19] groups that I could recall quickly.
[1:26:22] And I said, now I would like to have the
[1:26:25] Bible says, now I'm quoting the Bible.
[1:26:28] The Bible says that Jesus, the word was
[1:26:33] made flesh.
[1:26:35] I said, I would like the real Jesus to
[1:26:38] stand up.
[1:26:40] Nobody stood up.
[1:26:42] I said and I read from the scripture. I
[1:26:45] said, "This
[1:26:48] is Christ,
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; This is him."
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; And I said, "I know that the
[1:26:57] Salvation Army,
[1:26:59] they describe Jesus one way and
[1:27:02] Catholics another way and Baptists
[1:27:05] another way. And I know that they do not
[1:27:08] agree."
[1:27:11] I said, "Who has Jesus?
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; I'm confused. I want to know who has
[1:27:16] Jesus."
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; And and as a result, the the owner of
[1:27:22] the home gave his life to this Jesus
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; that he was hearing. Now, I'm I'm coming
[1:27:29] to my main thought in just a moment. So,
[1:27:32] I want you're listening real nice.
[1:27:36] And I said this Jesus,
[1:27:41] this word, this, we refer often to the
[1:27:45] word, but the words of God.
[1:27:48] Please
[1:27:52] just give me your full attention. Thank
[1:27:54] you.
[1:27:56] your mother
[1:27:59] when your father's seed
[1:28:02] I'm speaking to adults now your father's
[1:28:04] seed came to the womb of your mother
[1:28:09] and your mother ate of
[1:28:15] the vegetation of the earth the herbs
[1:28:19] the fruit
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; whatever more you are a product of the
[1:28:25] word of God. That's
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Even this shell here,
[1:28:31] you are a product of the word of God
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; in that in that sense.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; You also are a product of Eve's Eve's
[1:28:42] disobedience
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; of disbelief.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; That's why a prophet comes and says sin
[1:28:48] is not the drinking and the smoking and
[1:28:51] the gambling. That's not sinful. Those
[1:28:54] are the attributes of sin.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Even adultery and all of those things as
[1:28:59] the attributes of sin. The sin is not
[1:29:03] believing
[1:29:05] the fullness of the word of God. That's
[1:29:07] the sin.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; I hope you get that.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; We all came the same way.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Our mothers and fathers were product of
[1:29:17] the earth.
[1:29:20] Jesus Christ himself, the body was
[1:29:23] formed. The Bible says she believed,
[1:29:26] "Let it be unto me as thou hast spoken."
[1:29:30] She believed, the Virgin Mary believed
[1:29:34] the word of God that a virgin would
[1:29:37] conceive.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God, you'll not hear
[1:29:42] it anywhere else, so pay real strict
[1:29:45] attention. The prophet of God said those
[1:29:48] words, those words that were spoken by
[1:29:53] the prophet, because it wasn't a man, it
[1:29:56] wasn't just Isaiah speaking. It was God
[1:29:59] issuing his intent
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; concerning the new creation through her
[1:30:06] through there his mouth said, "A virgin
[1:30:09] shall conceive." And he says those words
[1:30:13] anchored in her heart in her in the womb
[1:30:16] of Mary and and and those words anchored
[1:30:20] in her womb. Here she is a vessel of the
[1:30:24] earth. And those were eternal words that
[1:30:27] were spoken by the ma mouth of God had a
[1:30:31] different intent. I hope you're able to
[1:30:33] understand. Even though even though she
[1:30:36] herself was a product of the earth, her
[1:30:39] mother ate the vegetables and so on and
[1:30:42] she's going to continue to eat to give a
[1:30:46] a a human life
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; to a man and God would be in him
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; reconciling the world to himself
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; and that is why he went to Calvary.
[1:30:59] People celebrate Easter. They know
[1:31:01] nothing about Easter. I tell you that
[1:31:03] this is a new creation
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; walking amongst an old creation. And
[1:31:09] friends, here's the struggle that you
[1:31:11] and I have.
[1:31:13] We are a new creation.
[1:31:17] We're a new creation by the Holy Spirit
[1:31:21] of God.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; He brooded over the earth
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; and up came the flowers and up came and
[1:31:28] God said, "Let the earth bring forth and
[1:31:33] it brought forth trees and herbs. Thou
[1:31:36] shalt eat of all the herbs and the
[1:31:39] plants and the things and they could eat
[1:31:41] of it, but they could not partake of the
[1:31:45] tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; and of that tree. In other words, there
[1:31:51] was an object that would present itself
[1:31:55] and they must not partake of that. And I
[1:31:58] can tell you friends today, this is not
[1:32:00] just my own thoughts, but you have to
[1:32:03] have the wisdom of the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; One person goes through further
[1:32:10] education
[1:32:12] and they can come out fine
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; because they keep eating from another
[1:32:17] tree. They keep eating from the tree of
[1:32:19] life
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; which is greater than the tree of
[1:32:23] knowledge of good and evil.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. The light that's in the believer
[1:32:27] is greater than the darkness that's in
[1:32:29] the world.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; You say amen to that.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; The message is greater. And now we have
[1:32:37] a people birthed by the Holy Spirit and
[1:32:42] feeding on the word that God gives
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; to the believer. It's a divine thing.
[1:32:51] You have nothing. You go to the you you
[1:32:54] go to the store and you go to the fruit
[1:32:56] stand and you say, "Well, I'll have some
[1:32:59] of this and I'll have some of this dill
[1:33:01] and I'll have some turnups and I'll have
[1:33:03] You had nothing to do with bringing that
[1:33:05] forth."
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; The people who weeded the garden had
[1:33:09] nothing to do with it.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; It grew because God said it back there,
[1:33:14] "Let the earth bring forth." And I drive
[1:33:17] past the fields here on 40th Avenue and
[1:33:20] I think, "Oh, God, how man just uh is so
[1:33:25] benefited from the from what you said
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; hundreds and thousands of years ago. Let
[1:33:32] the earth bring forth." Every season it
[1:33:35] brings forth. And we go to the store and
[1:33:38] we think that we're wonderful. I'm able
[1:33:40] to go to Sabon Foods or Safeway or
[1:33:43] wherever more and buy all of these
[1:33:45] vegetables. We didn't have anything to
[1:33:47] do. The man who put them there didn't
[1:33:49] have anything to do. The man who bought
[1:33:51] them and paid for them and the farmer
[1:33:53] who sprayed it, he doesn't have anything
[1:33:55] to do with it. The earth brought it
[1:33:57] forth
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; and our mothers and fathers ate it
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; and produced us
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; by the act of marriage.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; We didn't have very little to do. We had
[1:34:09] very little to do with bringing
[1:34:10] ourselves forth. And then you went to a
[1:34:13] church. You went to a certain place and
[1:34:16] this one preaches that and that one
[1:34:17] preaches something else and and they
[1:34:19] made denominations and made creeds and
[1:34:22] made books and you had to believe these
[1:34:25] books or something. And then Satan is so
[1:34:27] subtle. He said, "See, they just got
[1:34:29] books. They just got something to
[1:34:32] believe." Well,
[1:34:35] Jesus also believed something.
[1:34:38] Come on.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; He said what Moses said to do that do.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; But don't be as these people who say it
[1:34:49] but don't do it.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; I stood here and read and I felt
[1:34:56] unworthy reading John 17. Don't John 17
[1:35:01] ever don't ever look upon John 17 as
[1:35:05] just some verses in the Bible. It's more
[1:35:07] than that.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; It's a man of God, the son of God, son
[1:35:12] of the living God, speaking these things
[1:35:15] to his father. And he says, "Father, I'm
[1:35:19] no longer in the world, but these are in
[1:35:22] the world."
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Be with them.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; I've kept them from the world.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; He's kept you
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; from the world. And then he turned
[1:35:33] around and said, "These are not of the
[1:35:36] world, even as I am not of the world.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; I'm not the product of the world. I'm
[1:35:42] the product." He He didn't even claim to
[1:35:44] be the product of Adam and Eve.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; He was the product of almighty God.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; And we have been birthed by the Holy
[1:35:53] Ghost.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; We've been birthed, that's not just a
[1:35:55] phrase, we've been birthed by the Holy
[1:35:58] Spirit of God. It has brooded upon this
[1:36:02] word.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; These seeds,
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; this happens to be God's seed.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Human seed brings forth all kinds of
[1:36:15] life.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Human seed brings forth all kinds of
[1:36:19] life.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Some that God will destroy.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; And some that God will take as his own
[1:36:27] family.
[1:36:29] human seed.
[1:36:31] You know who are yours,
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; your relatives and whatever more.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; But God's seed is this
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit comes and broods
[1:36:43] upon this seed
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; and the spark to life
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; the human seed, the sperm of the man.
[1:36:54] I'm speaking now to adults. The human
[1:36:57] sperm of the man goes,
[1:37:02] and you'll understand something in just
[1:37:04] a moment, but it goes and of all those
[1:37:07] millions
[1:37:09] of germs,
[1:37:11] one will go
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; and attach itself
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; to the egg of the female and to the wall
[1:37:21] where it's intended and the organs. Who
[1:37:24] put those organs there? God himself.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; He made the whole thing.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Who did the conception? God.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; And by election, he elected some.
[1:37:39] He elected.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; This will be my child.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; He doesn't care where they were born.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; He doesn't care what color they are.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; He doesn't care what he gave them the
[1:37:51] color of their eyes and the color of
[1:37:53] their hair. He gave it all at that time.
[1:37:56] That's God's doing.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Aren't we glad for God's plan.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you friends.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; We thank we thank our heavenly father.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; It is such a marvelous plan.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; And then now here is a God. He brought
[1:38:16] about the first creation and it fell. He
[1:38:19] brought about the second creation and it
[1:38:22] does not fall.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; It does not fail.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; And down through the centuries he sent
[1:38:29] his messengers and the world slew them.
[1:38:34] Jesus said to kill the prophets.
[1:38:38] Fill up the cup of the prophets because
[1:38:42] fill up the cup of wrath because he knew
[1:38:44] they were not accepting him.
[1:38:47] Are you following me?
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; And almighty God who created all things
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; and the earth and all of these things,
[1:38:58] he's not going to allow
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; He's not going to allow the product of
[1:39:05] the new birth to be overcome by the
[1:39:09] product of the earth.
[1:39:11] He's not going to he's not going to
[1:39:14] allow the new creation to be overcome by
[1:39:18] the old creation.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; And so the Holy Spirit brooded upon the
[1:39:25] earth. We know that. And up came the
[1:39:28] growth and the vegetables and so on and
[1:39:31] so forth. And the prophet brother
[1:39:33] Brandham even speaks of it. And I hope
[1:39:36] that you have the capacity
[1:39:39] to understand
[1:39:40] that the product of the old birth has
[1:39:43] brought this life.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; And Satan, he just plays games. He
[1:39:48] tantalizes with it and all kinds of
[1:39:51] things and makes things that are so uh
[1:39:55] have such an effect upon the emotions.
[1:39:58] And brother Ernie, that's why I so
[1:40:01] enjoyed the service that he took the
[1:40:03] power of the senses and how Satan so
[1:40:07] tantalizes those senses. And and anyone
[1:40:10] who has not got the new birth, they'll
[1:40:13] be taken by these.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; But when you have the new birth,
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; it's not when you're old naturally. When
[1:40:21] you have the new birth, I didn't have
[1:40:23] any interest in the world. When I was
[1:40:26] just a teenager, before we were married,
[1:40:29] I had a vehicle and I had guys that had
[1:40:32] come by. They'd come by where I worked
[1:40:34] and say, "Do you want a drag race?"
[1:40:38] I thought, "Drag race? Are you crazy?"
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Why did I think that what he thought was
[1:40:45] exciting was a crazy to me?
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; I don't h I don't know. I can't explain
[1:40:50] that. I just can't explain that.
[1:40:55] And here I got something now I want to
[1:40:57] ask you.
[1:40:59] I was the age of some of you young men.
[1:41:04] I had to work too.
[1:41:07] We had to work and earn very little
[1:41:09] money.
[1:41:11] It was before credit cards. And I
[1:41:14] couldn't run up the gas pumps and get
[1:41:17] money
[1:41:18] that way, get credit that way.
[1:41:22] But I had a hunger.
[1:41:25] It's what I want to ask you about.
[1:41:26] That's why I'm standing here today. Had
[1:41:29] a hunger. A hunger.
[1:41:31] I was so hungry for the things of God.
[1:41:36] So we heard that there was a meeting.
[1:41:39] My wife went with a friend and some pick
[1:41:43] up her car or something. I didn't know.
[1:41:46] It was 350 miles from where we lived. I
[1:41:50] got on a motorcycle. until I had a
[1:41:52] motorcycle. I had to work until 5 or
[1:41:55] 6:00.
[1:41:57] And after that, then I got on the
[1:41:59] motorcycle
[1:42:00] and started to drive into Alberta to
[1:42:04] northern Alberta
[1:42:06] to a city called Manning, Alberta.
[1:42:10] There was very little pavement.
[1:42:13] It was mostly It was cold, colder than
[1:42:16] it is outside. But it reminds me of the
[1:42:20] time
[1:42:22] This is still the same person,
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; It was these legs I threw over a
[1:42:28] motorcycle. Uh-huh.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; And I got and we didn't have nice
[1:42:34] outfits that you could buy that were
[1:42:36] weatherproof.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; And I drove till way late in the night
[1:42:42] and it was becoming 1 and 2:00 in the
[1:42:45] morning and past Grand Prairie, Brother
[1:42:47] Tim, and over the Smoky River.
[1:42:51] And it got it got very cold at night.
[1:42:55] And I was pounding
[1:42:57] these legs
[1:43:00] to keep them from freezing.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. These legs,
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Legs of the earth.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Legs of the first creation.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; But inside,
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; was another creation.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Inside there was a hunger.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; The new man was so hungry. Amen.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; For God
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; and I pulled into a place I see light
[1:43:27] off and and I just have something in the
[1:43:30] human nature. I just oh I don't want to
[1:43:32] bother people. I don't want to I don't
[1:43:35] want to interrupt their evening as one
[1:43:38] at about 2:00 in the morning
[1:43:42] and then there was light right beside
[1:43:43] the road in a little log house. So I
[1:43:46] just pulled quickly off. I couldn't go
[1:43:49] any further and I leaned the motorcycle
[1:43:52] against the wall, came to the front door
[1:43:54] and just heard the man inside yell,
[1:43:57] "Come on in." So I opened the door and
[1:44:00] here's a guy at the back and he's got
[1:44:02] his feet up on the table and he's
[1:44:04] reading a book.
[1:44:06] He said, "Do you ever hear this author?"
[1:44:09] He named the author. I thought I'm a
[1:44:11] total stranger. But you know, we never
[1:44:14] worried about anybody coming in to rob
[1:44:16] anybody that was out of our mind. And he
[1:44:20] said, "Do you ever read a book by this?"
[1:44:22] So I said, "No, I haven't. Never did."
[1:44:25] So I said, "Listen, I I just I just came
[1:44:29] up with a motorcycle." Oh, he said, "I
[1:44:31] didn't hear it." I said, "Yeah, I parked
[1:44:33] it right outside."
[1:44:35] And I said, "I'm just wondering if you
[1:44:37] got a place I can kind of camp over the
[1:44:40] night." Oh, yeah. Yeah. I says, "So, his
[1:44:42] bedroom's right there. You can stay
[1:44:44] there." I don't know. I don't know his
[1:44:46] name. I don't know anything about him. I
[1:44:49] don't know if he was married or not
[1:44:50] married. He probably wasn't, but anyway,
[1:44:53] he said, "You can just stay there. I'll
[1:44:54] make you bacon and eggs in the morning."
[1:44:56] And so, I never did find out his name.
[1:45:02] And I pray, God, just make a place, give
[1:45:05] him a bed someplace, sometime. And I got
[1:45:08] up in the morning and went the rest of
[1:45:10] the way. You know why? And then there
[1:45:12] was about 4 ines of snow, fresh snow,
[1:45:15] and the cars were going by and they
[1:45:17] started to melt and they thought it was
[1:45:19] fun. You know, they just splash splashed
[1:45:22] me up with uh with their cars. They sped
[1:45:25] by. That was the only direction only
[1:45:27] time we had a little bit of pavement and
[1:45:29] I finished off
[1:45:32] the trip. Why?
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; I'm just hungry for a meeting.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; I just want to be in church that night.
[1:45:38] Amen.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; I don't know the name of the pastor.
[1:45:41] Yes, I do. His name was Ericson. I think
[1:45:44] he was a Baptist. Baptist and
[1:45:46] organization. Didn't mean nothing.
[1:45:49] Didn't mean nothing.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; It was in that atmosphere.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God's ministry was born.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; And that's why we just accepted it.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; This is just a natural thing.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; And you know what we said? We said he's
[1:46:05] a prophet. Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; We didn't we didn't know any of the
[1:46:08] scripture. We didn't know Malachi 4. We
[1:46:11] didn't know Revelation 10. We just said,
[1:46:13] "This is a prophet. This is what a
[1:46:15] prophet does.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; This is what a prophet says." And so we
[1:46:20] went to that meeting and and uh I'm just
[1:46:24] going to tell you this and I'm I'm
[1:46:26] finished with it.
[1:46:30] That night
[1:46:32] I stayed in the sleeping bag with four
[1:46:34] or five other brothers at the back of
[1:46:36] the church in the kitchen or something.
[1:46:40] And I got down into that sleeping bag
[1:46:43] and I got such a burden. I got I I began
[1:46:47] to intercede.
[1:46:49] I didn't know what a hardly intercession
[1:46:50] was, but I knew what a burden was.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Friends, this is a real life.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; This isn't just going to church Sunday
[1:46:58] morning. This is going so hungry
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; and so sensitive to the Holy Spirit that
[1:47:06] the Holy Spirit can speak or can lay
[1:47:09] something on your heart. You don't have
[1:47:11] to be thinking about what you're going
[1:47:13] to do tomorrow. It's God Almighty.
[1:47:15] Hallelujah.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Thinking what he's going to do tomorrow.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; And so I I rolled and I wept and I
[1:47:23] groaned and I didn't know what I was
[1:47:25] praying for. And I groaned and rolled
[1:47:28] until I just was weak. And I finally
[1:47:31] just went to sleep.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; In the morning, the pastor, who I've
[1:47:36] never heard, he got up in the morning
[1:47:39] and he said,
[1:47:41] "We grieved the Holy Spirit last night."
[1:47:48] He said, "We grieved the Holy Spirit
[1:47:50] last night."
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; I didn't know what he was talking about.
[1:47:56] Then he said somebody prayed
[1:48:01] and I went to him right after the
[1:48:03] service and I told him what happened to
[1:48:05] me. He said that was it.
[1:48:07] He never said anything further.
[1:48:11] So there was a
[1:48:13] almost like a
[1:48:16] little mystery to the whole thing.
[1:48:21] You know, brother Brandham speaks about
[1:48:24] people who are led by the Holy Ghost.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; And they're almost mystics.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; To the world. The world can't that isn't
[1:48:33] two and two makes four.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; That is that's above algebra. That's
[1:48:38] that's something from another realm.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; But when you're born again,
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; you're dictated to by the Holy Spirit.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; And we have those things. I don't tell
[1:48:50] about a lot of those things that happen
[1:48:53] regularly
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; in this congregation, supernatural
[1:48:57] things.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; And that's what makes me to know
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; there's a God in heaven is ordained
[1:49:05] himself. He's ordained that we should
[1:49:09] believe. And furthermore, that is why
[1:49:13] ministry comes behind this pulpit and
[1:49:16] begins to speak
[1:49:20] from the message,
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; From the word.
[1:49:25] And here I'm going to make known to you
[1:49:28] something that perhaps hasn't come to
[1:49:30] your mind.
[1:49:34] The prophet said
[1:49:38] it lay cell upon cell,
[1:49:42] cell upon cell.
[1:49:46] Do you know anything about your body
[1:49:47] forming
[1:49:49] that you're sitting in right now? This
[1:49:50] is you.
[1:49:52] You know anything about it forming? You
[1:49:54] weren't around.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Did you give any instruction or
[1:49:59] direction?
[1:50:01] Did your mother or father give any
[1:50:03] instruction or direction?
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; This is how he's going to be. This how
[1:50:08] she's going to be.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; It didn't have anything to do with it.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; And now a message comes
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; and you don't know anything about the
[1:50:24] servant,
[1:50:26] the vessel.
[1:50:28] And God is pushing himself
[1:50:32] himself
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; through
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; right
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; clay
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; redeemed clay
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; and he takes a vessel
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; and people
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; to me it's so absurd forgive me but I
[1:50:50] think that people who rise themselves up
[1:50:52] in their mind and say well I this is
[1:50:54] what I think of William Brandham and
[1:50:56] this is what I think of the pope open.
[1:50:58] This is what I think. Who cares what you
[1:51:00] think?
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; God's already decided.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; God's already got election.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; God is saying and I am saying on his
[1:51:09] behalf, God says election is mine.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; I do what I will.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; I do what I intend to do.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; And I will fulfill it. Amen.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; You you can wrestle all you wish friends
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; but God in the end
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; his will shall be done
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; and the elect say thy will
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; be done
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; on earth
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; as it is in heaven.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; This is my you are my father
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; and this is my attitude toward you. I
[1:51:45] bless your name. I worship you because
[1:51:49] you have brought me your Holy Spirit has
[1:51:53] has brooded over the words. How will I
[1:51:57] how will I know which words it is? He
[1:52:00] has selected certain ones. He selected a
[1:52:03] message for Philadelphia and for Thotyra
[1:52:06] and for Sardis and he selected a message
[1:52:09] for Leisa.
[1:52:11] And he says to John, "Write
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; and tell him who's speaking. I'm the
[1:52:18] faithful one. I'm the amen of God.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; I'm the faithful messenger."
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; And write these things.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; To the angel or to the messenger,
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; the angel of the church. Right.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; And I wonder
[1:52:40] I had not intended on
[1:52:46] saying much about this.
[1:53:21] You're familiar with all the destruction
[1:53:24] that's been taking place.
[1:53:32] And I'm just reading what others have
[1:53:34] said.
[1:53:38] The 2018 wildfire session
[1:53:42] is the most destructive
[1:53:44] on record
[1:53:46] in California
[1:53:48] with a total of 7,000
[1:53:52] 579 fires
[1:53:56] burning an area of 1 million 667,855
[1:54:04] acres.
[1:54:08] the largest amount of burned acreage
[1:54:12] recorded in a fire season
[1:54:17] according
[1:54:19] the California Department of Forestry.
[1:54:26] Brother Brandham spoke a message in
[1:54:29] Yuma, Arizona, right on the border
[1:54:34] on December the 4th in 1965.
[1:54:38] Listen close now.
[1:54:41] If you were Almighty God,
[1:54:44] women, men,
[1:54:47] if you were Almighty God
[1:54:51] and you could sit on your throne,
[1:54:54] you say, "Well, now
[1:55:00] this is the last message
[1:55:03] and I sending it to the earth.
[1:55:12] And I've said to my
[1:55:16] apostle John,
[1:55:19] I've showed him
[1:55:21] gave him the message to the Leodysans.
[1:55:25] Now I want you to write
[1:55:28] write it
[1:55:30] and send it to the angel
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; right
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; of that church.
[1:55:36] And now the great eternal God
[1:55:41] when that season comes,
[1:55:44] his spirit
[1:55:46] is directed.
[1:55:48] His spirit who's the author of this
[1:55:50] word.
[1:55:52] See, now there's a certain thing that
[1:55:54] must be said,
[1:55:59] and I want you now to brood over
[1:56:05] these cells.
[1:56:07] Brood over
[1:56:10] this mighty, eternal, lifegiving word of
[1:56:13] God.
[1:56:15] There will be some elected people.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; There'll be living
[1:56:24] Yes,
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; by the first birth.
[1:56:27] But I am not willing
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; that they shall be destroyed.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; I am not willing that my enemy, arch
[1:56:36] enemy, Satan should foil my plan.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; These shall come forth.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; And I shall send this Holy Spirit, my
[1:56:47] spirit,
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; to brood over the earth.
[1:56:51] Now the word has gone. Yeah. They put it
[1:56:54] into books. They put into all kinds of
[1:56:57] theological
[1:56:59] seminaries etc. and have declared this
[1:57:02] and that and the other thing. But I have
[1:57:04] a prophet down there
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; and I want you to get this message to
[1:57:10] him.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; And let him identify himself
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; in the scripture in my word. Let him
[1:57:18] identify himself. He's the one that must
[1:57:21] speak and say these things.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; And this is the one, this is the
[1:57:27] Almighty speaking. This is the amen,
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; the faithful and true witness.
[1:57:32] Furthermore, this is the beginning of
[1:57:35] the creation of God.
[1:57:40] and brood over these words.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; And as it's brooding over the words, the
[1:57:48] brooding of the great son of God,
[1:57:54] it shines upon stones.
[1:57:57] Nothing happens.
[1:57:59] shines upon some part of earth
[1:58:03] and maybe vegetation comes but shines
[1:58:07] upon some wheat
[1:58:11] gathered into my corner.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; I have much to say and at the end of
[1:58:17] this age
[1:58:19] these are the things that are going to
[1:58:21] take place.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:24] And this prophet,
[1:58:28] he spoke the message of rapture.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; You plan to be in the rapture. He spoke
[1:58:34] about the rapture.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; This is the fourth last message that he
[1:58:40] speaks.
[1:58:42] And it's 3 hours and 41 minutes by car
[1:58:47] to go to Rialto, California.
[1:58:51] And there he will preach things that are
[1:58:53] to be.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; And this is where much of this message
[1:58:59] even came from.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; He speaks of the
[1:59:04] relationship
[1:59:09] and of the coming of the children coming
[1:59:13] forth.
[1:59:17] And then 40 minutes from there,
[1:59:21] 40 minutes,
[1:59:24] he'll speak the next night in San
[1:59:26] Bernardino
[1:59:29] and he'll speak their modern events
[1:59:32] made clear by prophecy.
[1:59:35] And in that service, he says, "This is a
[1:59:38] horrible time,
[1:59:42] but it's the most glorious time in the
[1:59:46] world to preach the gospel."
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; What's he talking about? The two two two
[1:59:53] creations. It's a horrible time
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; for the lost.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; It's the most glorious time to preach
[2:00:01] the gospel. Amen.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; That's the only way you can have a
[2:00:04] horrible time and a wonderful time,
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; my friends.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Believer friends,
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; this is a horrible time,
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; but it's a glorious time
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; to stand for Christ
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; and for the new creation of God.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; It's the most glorious time to preach
[2:00:28] the gospel.
[2:00:30] If I could have stood on the brink of
[2:00:33] time before it came into existence
[2:00:37] and the father would have looked at me
[2:00:40] and said, "What time down through the
[2:00:43] ages would you want to preach?
[2:00:49] I'd want it right now."
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. Just before the coming.
[2:00:59] just before the coming of him.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, if I could only preach,
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; just before he comes,
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; just before this rapture which he
[2:01:10] described
[2:01:12] just a two days ago, I would want to
[2:01:15] preach at this time
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; even though it's a terrible time,
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; It's a wicked time
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; and the thoughts of man's mind and
[2:01:25] intent are only evil continually.
[2:01:29] Friends, this world is fitted for
[2:01:32] destruction.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; California will be just child's play
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; alongside of what's going to happen. The
[2:01:42] prophet of God spoke about the earth
[2:01:45] erupting
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; and coming forth.
[2:01:51] I'll tell you what, even down in Hawaii,
[2:01:55] they even tried to figure out
[2:01:58] how to stop the lava.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; They couldn't stop it
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; and couldn't stop it from burning.
[2:02:06] The pro, this prophet of God said, "And
[2:02:09] you can take whatever direction you want
[2:02:11] to take. I just say I believe it."
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "The earth will burst forth."
[2:02:16] Yeah.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't believe in some
[2:02:19] someone might say I don't believe in a
[2:02:21] hell." You're standing on a you're
[2:02:23] sitting this morning, Sunday morning, on
[2:02:25] a whole globe full of it. Right.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; 40 minutes
[2:02:38] from San Bernardino when he was in
[2:02:41] Covena to preach the last service.
[2:02:46] I suggest you read
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; all of those
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; rapture
[2:02:54] 3 hours 40 minutes later things that are
[2:02:58] to be
[2:03:00] 40 minutes another direction to Cavina
[2:03:04] and there he preaches leadership
[2:03:08] and he asks in there who's leading you
[2:03:11] now
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; right
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; who's leading you Now
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; what about a young fellas?
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Well, my teacher or my professor said
[2:03:27] such and such.
[2:03:29] His voice will be silent.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; He won't even be around. My boss, my
[2:03:36] superior said, "I was doing this. I was
[2:03:39] doing that." But what does he say?
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; That's the one to listen to.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:46] Yes,
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; that's the one to listen to.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; And all these other things we may just
[2:03:53] use
[2:03:56] them, but say this life will be
[2:04:02] given to hunger after God.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean we just walk around,
[2:04:08] you know, and do nothing. No.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; But we have a direction
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; and God is our direction. Right.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; I hope these things have meant something
[2:04:18] to you.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; I've been very affected by it.
[2:04:31] And so now say, well, what what did you
[2:04:35] say? And I'm I'm closing. What did you
[2:04:38] say in the last two hours?
[2:04:44] While you've sat here,
[2:04:48] there may be somebody,
[2:04:53] you may have conceived.
[2:04:56] I'm speaking very plain.
[2:04:58] There may be some mother here that is
[2:05:01] conceived
[2:05:02] and you don't even know it.
[2:05:06] You have no way of knowing it. But there
[2:05:09] may be an infant
[2:05:12] that has been conceived.
[2:05:15] We don't know.
[2:05:18] But in the new in the new birth,
[2:05:23] maybe someone has conceived.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Maybe a a life
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; has come
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; into the individual heart, soul. I I
[2:05:35] don't know where the spot is, but
[2:05:37] wouldn't that be more important?
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; The other one's going to bring a human.
[2:05:42] This one's going to bring a son or
[2:05:44] daughter of God,
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; born again,
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; of the spirit of God. What are they
[2:05:50] going to do? Is it going to be another
[2:05:52] Fanny Crosby
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; or is it going to be what is it going to
[2:05:56] be? Another minister's wife
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; or another preacher of the gospel? We
[2:06:01] don't know.
[2:06:03] We have no way of knowing and it's not
[2:06:05] our business.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; I say
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; thy will be done.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; We'll be faithful to this word.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Somebody will hear it.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Somebody will be moved.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Somebody will be fed.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, precious young people.
[2:06:28] Precious young people,
[2:06:30] just give your strength,
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; give your future days
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; to him.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Will you bow your head with me? Heavenly
[2:06:41] Father,
[2:06:43] we've spoken
[2:06:45] what you've laid upon our hearts
[2:06:48] and I have
[2:06:50] sought to deliver it to them to the
[2:06:53] people, the congregation that you've
[2:06:55] gathered here today. I pray, Father,
[2:06:59] you'll take this church.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Pray you'll take the congregation,
[2:07:04] the song leaders and the worship
[2:07:06] leaders,
[2:07:08] the musicians. Oh God,
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; those that attend to the streaming
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; and sending this word out. Oh God,
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; we want to we we are not afraid to be
[2:07:21] identified with your messenger.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we thank you that you've sent
[2:07:27] him.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; We thank you that you have sent the Holy
[2:07:30] Ghost.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; You've not only guided him, but now you
[2:07:34] guide us into this word. And here we
[2:07:37] are, Lord, representing the message to
[2:07:40] the Leodysian church. We see a world
[2:07:44] that is falling apart. Oh God, we see
[2:07:48] such confusion and everybody declaring
[2:07:51] to be the truth. We thank you, oh God,
[2:07:54] that you speak your truth
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; and you confirm your truth.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; You vindicate your truth. And we ask you
[2:08:03] to come forward Lord
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; and vindicate Father I pray the power of
[2:08:09] Christ, the power of Calvary in healing.
[2:08:12] Oh God, our brother Peter, oh God, raise
[2:08:16] him up, Father,
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; not for our glory, but for your glory,
[2:08:22] raise him up, oh God. Our sister Helen
[2:08:24] Billisburgger, raise her up, oh God.
[2:08:28] give her the use of her her body. Oh
[2:08:32] father, I pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:08:35] There may be many others that are
[2:08:37] suffering, Lord. Or there are others
[2:08:40] that Satan has attracted and he has done
[2:08:44] everything he can, Lord, to draw them
[2:08:48] aside. I pray, Father, it will be in
[2:08:51] vain as of now. Let the Holy Spirit
[2:08:55] come,
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and invalidate what he is
[2:08:58] attempting to do. Lord, there's perhaps
[2:09:01] people that have been invited and are
[2:09:03] visiting for the first time. Oh, I pray,
[2:09:06] oh God, I pray, Father, in the name of
[2:09:10] the son of God, Jesus Christ, that they
[2:09:13] will feel a a sensation of a pull, a
[2:09:18] drawing,
[2:09:19] oh God. A drawing that we cannot
[2:09:22] understand. One that will say, "I will
[2:09:25] go."
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; I will seek out these things, Lord. May
[2:09:30] they be like the Bereans. I pray father
[2:09:34] you'll bless this service and the
[2:09:37] service tonight and our brother John
[2:09:39] that will journey with his family down
[2:09:42] to Ron.
[2:09:45] Oh God moved by your holy spirit
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; on this west coast we pray in the name
[2:09:53] of Jesus Christ we give you all the
[2:09:56] glory. Amen and amen.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:03] God bless you.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; He's wonderful.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is,
[2:10:12] brother Tom.
[2:10:18] Thank you for your attention.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:35] in the poor.
[2:10:40] I hear the Lord
[2:10:49] Here is
[2:10:53] me to give my
[2:11:01] he
[2:11:02] to me
[2:11:07] and I
[2:11:15] for my
[2:11:18] savior
[2:11:20] soul. I feel the
[2:11:28] I feel the Lord
[2:11:34] in my ear
[2:11:42] and his spirit is moving
[2:11:47] me to give
[2:11:50] I
[2:11:56] speak to me
[2:12:02] and I
[2:12:09] Lord
[2:12:11] come and save my soul.
[2:12:16] I feel
[2:12:22] as the musicians continue to play. I
[2:12:24] thought it was
[2:12:26] just the Lord that we showed a picture
[2:12:28] of a little baby
[2:12:30] at the beginning of a service than
[2:12:32] natural.
[2:12:35] But how greater is that spiritual birth?
[2:12:40] That joy that bring that little baby
[2:12:41] will bring a home will be just
[2:12:43] tremendous.
[2:12:44] But the joy that brings the body of
[2:12:46] Christ is a new birth. And that is the
[2:12:50] most important thing. Not allowing the
[2:12:53] new creation to be overcome from the old
[2:12:55] creation.
[2:12:57] This new creation that God is creating.
[2:13:00] There's a deep calling to the deep. I
[2:13:02] don't know about you, but that's all
[2:13:04] I've been in in the last few days.
[2:13:06] Future home. Things that are to be. It's
[2:13:08] a call. It's a pull.
[2:13:11] We're living in the two realms, in the
[2:13:13] two worlds.
[2:13:15] But I'm so thankful at a horrible time,
[2:13:18] as the pastor was saying, this is the
[2:13:21] most glorious time for the elect of God.
[2:13:25] And if you haven't come to this
[2:13:26] knowledge of salvation
[2:13:29] or Jesus Christ as a personal savior,
[2:13:32] maybe this is your service and the Holy
[2:13:35] Spirit is tugging at your heart saying,
[2:13:37] "Just surrender. I feel a pull. I want
[2:13:41] to pass from death unto life. I want to
[2:13:44] go into his glorious kingdom. I want to
[2:13:46] be carried away. I want to be raptured.
[2:13:49] I want to be changed. Maybe the word is
[2:13:51] speaking to you because each and every
[2:13:54] one must be born again.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; I feel the pull.
[2:14:07] Lord, speak to your own this morning.
[2:14:15] Jesus, you know you're only
[2:14:18] a lamb of God.
[2:14:29] He speaks speakingly, Lord, to your
[2:14:32] children.
[2:14:36] and I
[2:14:43] Lord please come and take
[2:14:48] control.
[2:14:50] I feel the Lord.
[2:14:57] Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[2:15:01] Maybe there's somebody here this morning
[2:15:02] that actually feels the pull or the tug
[2:15:06] of the Holy Spirit.
[2:15:09] And God's dealing with your heart and
[2:15:10] you on a surrender
[2:15:14] in a greater way, a more consecrated
[2:15:16] way, a more dedicated way.
[2:15:20] As a scripture was read this morning,
[2:15:22] you must be born again. It's not an
[2:15:25] option.
[2:15:27] It's it's it's something that it comes
[2:15:29] from within.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; And if you're here this morning, you
[2:15:35] just want to lift up your heart, lift up
[2:15:37] your hand, and say, "Lord, save me.
[2:15:42] Deliver me. Set me free from the
[2:15:45] entanglements of sin and depression,
[2:15:49] from the burden of being lost, no hope,
[2:15:54] nowhere to go. But there's something
[2:15:56] within you that feels the pull that
[2:15:59] said, "Lord, here am I. Lord, save me.
[2:16:04] Save me, Lord."
[2:16:07] And Lord, with these hands and different
[2:16:09] ones raised around the room,
[2:16:13] you know the heart.
[2:16:16] You know the reason
[2:16:19] where some feel the pull and others it
[2:16:21] just goes right over.
[2:16:24] So, Father, I pray that that hand and
[2:16:26] lift it up, that God, you'll reach down
[2:16:29] your hand and you'll start and kindle a
[2:16:32] fire that will never be quenched, Lord.
[2:16:35] That the Holy Spirit himself would
[2:16:38] breathe upon that life and bring forth a
[2:16:40] new creation by the word of life that
[2:16:44] was spoken this morning.
[2:16:46] Confirm your word, Lord.
[2:16:49] Confirm it in the hearts of your
[2:16:51] children. and let the Holy Ghost have
[2:16:54] its free course
[2:16:57] and committing these hands and these
[2:16:58] lives and these needs to you in Jesus
[2:17:02] precious name.
[2:17:06] Amen.
[2:17:08] Let's sing this glorious old song. Down
[2:17:11] from his glory, everliving story.
[2:17:19] down from his glory.
[2:17:29] Glory

[2:17:36] name

[2:17:52] strangeanger

[2:18:56] with
[2:18:58] reluctance
[2:19:02] flesh and blood.
[2:19:09] He took the form of man
[2:19:14] and revealed the healing
[2:19:18] plan.

[2:20:25] Oh, let's just sing this chorus. Let's
[2:20:28] just all worship as we get ready to
[2:20:30] close now.

[2:21:22] And all God's fullness dwelleth in him.
[2:21:25] What a savior. What a redeemer.
[2:21:28] This great mystery unfolded.
[2:21:32] And God has come today to reveal it
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; to the sons and daughters of God. How
[2:21:37] happy we should be.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; How thankful we should be that actually
[2:21:42] we did feel the pull of God.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And
[2:21:47] I don't know what to say cuz brother
[2:21:49] Biscll just just spoke the last half of
[2:21:51] his ser. I turn over turned over to
[2:21:52] brother John. I said I'm in a heap of
[2:21:54] trouble.
[2:21:56] I'm preaching on fire tonight.
[2:21:59] Birth by the fire of God.
[2:22:02] So God has a continuity. And we just
[2:22:04] pray that you'll come expecting, come
[2:22:06] praying that we also could have the fire
[2:22:10] of God. There's a reason why there's
[2:22:12] fires going on
[2:22:14] because there's a holy fire descending
[2:22:17] and there's another fire that's come so
[2:22:19] that we can ascend.
[2:22:21] May God bless you. May the presence of
[2:22:23] God go with you. May you ponder these
[2:22:26] things as Mary did when she heard the
[2:22:28] salutation of an angel. She pondered
[2:22:30] these things within her heart. We've
[2:22:32] heard from God this morning. So, God
[2:22:35] bless you. Greet one another. You're
[2:22:37] dismissed in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:25:40] Wow.
[2:26:41] Oh yeah.
