[0:00] who is this that darkeneth counsel by
[0:02] words without knowledge gir up now thy
[0:05] loins like a man for I will demand of
[0:07] thee and answer thou me where was thou
[0:10] when I laid the foundations of the earth
[0:13] declare if thou Hast understanding who
[0:16] hath laid the measures thereof if thou
[0:18] knowest or who hath stretched the line
[0:21] upon it whereupon are the foundations
[0:23] thereof fastened or who laid the
[0:25] Cornerstone thereof when the morning
[0:28] Stars sank together and all the the sons
[0:30] of God shouted for Joy or who shut up
[0:33] the sea with doors when it Break Forth
[0:35] as if it had issued out of the womb when
[0:38] I made the cloud the Garment thereof and
[0:40] thick Darkness a swaddling band for it
[0:43] and break up for it my decreed place and
[0:45] set bars and doors and said hither to
[0:48] shalt Thou come but no further and here
[0:51] shall thy proud waves be stayed hast
[0:53] thou commanded the morning since thy
[0:55] days and caus the day spring to know his
[0:58] place that it might take hold of the
[1:00] ends of the Earth that the wicked might
[1:02] be shaken out of it
