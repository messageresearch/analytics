Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise your name, Lord God. Praise your name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're going to go to prayer this time in this presence. Ask brother John Andy's. Brother John, if you'd come open the service in a word of prayer. Our sister Ela has written a note. We want to remember sister Rachel from Maine who requests the believers to uh support her in prayer as she was once again diagnosed with cancer. She's not able to take the medication and needs a desperate touch from the hand of God to touch her. Also, Brother Matthew Redell has a prayer request here for a c-orker by the name of Dave whose father Frank is in the hospital with a severe heart condition. Apparently, brother Matthews had a chance to witness to Dave. He says he's close to be coming to church. So, we just wanted to ask that God would move not only on Dave's father, Frank, but also on Dave's life himself. Amen. If you have any needs this morning, just raise your hand and heart as we go to prayer. Actually, I'd like to sing as brother brother John comes. I'd like to sing only believe. Only believe all things are possible. Holy dream, only believe that all things are possible. Holy believe. Holy. [Music] All things are possible. Holy. [Music] Our Lord Jesus. Let's believe right now. Our Jesus, all things are possible and all things [Music] because he's here. Oh yes, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Our Jesus is here. Jesus. Oh yes, Father. All things are possible. Jesus, let's all agree together. Heavenly Father, we want to bless your name together. Lord, we want to throw open the doors of our hearts, our lips, our lives are before you. We want to praise your holy name. Even before we speak about our needs or what's on our hearts, we want to express to you our love, our adoration. Oh, if these hands could lift up, Lord, if our lips could tell you what's in our hearts, if our hearts could speak this morning, it would be volumes right now. Lord Jesus, we love you. We appreciate you. We thank you for what you've done, what you're doing. Jesus, only eternity will be able to tell your greatness, your majesty, your glory. Father, Lord, we as humans, we as your bride, we as your lady, we open up our hearts to tell you we love you. We thank you for redemption, bringing us back, Lord, to our right minds, to our ought to be condition. You're doing that this morning, Jesus. And we want to see it happen in a further way. We want to see scales drop off our eyes and ears be open, hearts be open, even lives that aren't even in this room, our family members, loved ones that need a touch. Lord, we believe you're doing a miracle right now. We believe you're able to turn hearts around and move in situations, take cancers out of bodies, give a young person a right mind, the mind of Christ, that they would surrender, that they would yield, that your Holy Spirit would permeate through their lives, and bring a marriage back together. Bring lives that are strangers into the family, into the home. This is your house. This is your house of praise. This is the house of prayer. This is where we release our cares, our burdens to you. Abba Father, you are our father. You are the one true living God. You are the only God. You are the only truth. You are the only way. You are alive this morning, Jesus. Father, anything could happen in your presence. Lord, we believe our hearts are ready, Father, to do your will and submit ourselves. Lord, we pray that you go to Rachel there in Maine. Father, dealing this situation, this life, she needs a touch from you, Jesus. Lord, even this one that Matthew spoken to needs a touch. You're dealing in his life, Father. A part of the body's been affected affected his life. I pray that you would move in that situation into lives. Father, our hands are lifted up. There's needs in the building, Jesus. There's prayer that's gone up before, Lord. Even this prayer, and we're agreeing together that the strongholds of the enemy would be broken, that he would be crushed, that he would be bruised, that his back would be broken, that men and women would enter into a realm, Lord, at the sound of your voice this morning, that every captive would be set free, every life that might be shackled or or bruised, that you would heal them. Jesus, you sent your word and healed us. May that hand move across our lives again this morning. If there's areas, Lord, that needs to be touched, things that need to be dealt with. Father, Lord, we've not dressed for one another. We haven't come here to see one another. We want to see you, Jesus. Deal with our hearts, God. Do a surgery. Father, we know our birth is a mess. We haven't come here to put on a show or to hide behind a facade. Break us, Lord. Purge us, Lord. We want to bring forth more fruit, much fruit. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Do a heart transplant, Lord. Take our lives, take our lips, take our spirits, our bodies, our souls are before you, Jesus. Lord, let the word have an incredible effect, Jesus, this morning. Don't let us be dull. Don't let us be drifting out into another galaxy. But Lord, bring us bring us subject to thus, sayeth the Lord. In your presence, the supernatural's moving. Hearts are being mended. Lives are being broken. Lord, there's a fountain of grace that's being made available. Oh God, we don't want to miss you this morning. Your appearing, your face, your presence is what we live for. We live for this, Jesus. We want to give our all to you. We want to surrender right now. Not at the end of the service, but right now, we want to yield our members. We want to let you have full course. Even now, those out on the internet, Father, those on the phone, hook up, those that are sick and body, those that need a touch. Jesus, time or distance means nothing to you. You are present and you're touched with the feeling of what we're going through. And we, as your bride, just make ourselves available. We make our womb available. Let your will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Take this service as a love gift back to yourself. We want to enter in now. Get get our hearts prepared for what you have to say to us. We love you, Jesus. Minister this morning in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [Music] Amen. You may have your seats. And I have a couple of announcements, but as I'm making them, Sister Lesley and in your group, if they want to come up now and get ready, can you turn me down just a little bit? Thanks. Come get ready at this time. As I make these, uh, the Bible believers mission update is now available at the tape library. So, if you want to uh grab that, I believe it's most likely one per family. So, you can grab those at the tape library. Also, we want to welcome sister Adah's husband just arrived from the Philippines to sojourn with us. Why don't we get him to stand and we can welcome you. God bless you. It's good to have you. Amen. Thank you. Amen. They gave me a name, but I didn't want to embarrass myself. So, when you see him, make sure you shake his hand and you can ask Sister Ada how to pronounce his name. It's just safer that way. Uh, also, Brother Jess Berios has a announcement here. There will be a meeting in the chapel right after the evening service for all those who are interested in helping with the Bible camp this year. So, you can meet Brother Jess tonight. Amen. God bless you all saints. Just enter in and worship the Lord with us in this song. Amen. Jesus is here right now. [Music] Jesus is here right now. Jesus is here right now. He is here to meet your need to set the captives free. Oh, Jesus is here right now. Jesus is here right now. &gt;&gt; Just reach out and touch him. Jesus is here right now. He is here to meet your needs. to set the captives free. Oh, Jesus is here right now. [Music] If you feel all hope is gone and you're fighting this battle alone and depression threatens your very soul, Jesus would visit you today. Take that dark cloud away. Oh, Jesus is here right now. I know he is. Jesus is here right now. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's moving in this place. Jesus is here right now. You just reach out and touch and he is here to meet your need. to set the captives free. Oh, Jesus is here right now. He was broken for you and me. But yet, he rose triumphantly to give us victory over death, hell, and the grave. Seven angels came in a cloud. His voice it turned out loud and he said, "Jesus is here right now. Jesus is here right now. He is here to meet your every need. Jesus is here right now. in this place. He's here to meet your needs, to set the captive free. Oh, Jesus, he's here right now. S again. Jesus is here right now. Just touch the hem of his garment. Jesus is here right now. I show your love and he is here to meet your need to set the captive free. Oh Jesus is here right now. Jesus is here right now. [Music] Jesus is here right now. here to meet your needs, to set the captives free. Oh Jesus, he's here and now he is here to meet your need to set the captives free. Oh Jesus is here right now. [Music] Amen. Aren't you glad he's here to meet our needs? If you just ask him as brother Ed comes sing the word.

Happy to see you all here today and to feel and sense the presence of the Lord and enjoy the ladies of choir singing. And well, we're here now to hear the word. &gt;&gt; So, we need to be in prayer about that. Amen. God bless you. Nice to see our brother here. And nice to see brother Gay as well. God bless you, brother Gay. Uh to finally see, I saw in the Oh, yes. Our sister Aida her husband here as well. You welcomed him. Others that may be visiting. and uh we were away of course happy to be uh back. We had a wonderful time at uh at brother Donnie Reagan's and brother Jeff Jenkins church also with brother Samuel Dale and we won't spend any time with that but uh brother Murphy and Sister Tracy it was it was sister Tracy's first time to be uh or to see another congregation outside of here and and China and she really enjoyed it and we were so happy to have Brother Murphy and Sister Tracy with us. The congregation there were very very blessed uh and uh have brother Murphy uh introduce them further with the work in China. And we were just so delighted. While we were in Lima, I had the opportunity to meet our brother Anoir Chavad and he is uh with us going to be speaking tonight. Our brother Anoir is from Pakistan and uh we didn't recognize him in the service did we? Where is our brother Anoir? Maybe you can just come here a moment. Our brother Anar will be preaching tonight. &gt;&gt; God bless you brother there. He will be preaching tonight and uh our brother has been a pastor for quite a number of years in Lahore Pakistan and then came to the message a few years ago. He was he was ministering I think pastoring for about 8 years prior to that weren't you? Yes. And uh and then God opened his understanding and his eyes to the message. And so we were happy to meet meet him there in Lima. And tonight you'll hear the rest of the story. Amen. God bless you, brother. [Music] Brother Lonnie Jenkins who has been really laboring for a lot of years to get the message into into Pakistan which is largely Muslim and uh it's not a difficult it's not an easy place it's a difficult place to get the message established there and brother Lonnie is very very encouraged that our brother Anoir has uh has taken a real burden to do this. One of the reasons of course that he's here not only to meet you and so I can have a little time with him but he's here to work with brother Murphy and brother Tony was brother Tony's burden so that the message could begin to have a voice over in their language in in that country. So, we're very very happy to do whatever we can do and to be a part uh and to encourage our brother Anoir in the work there. I want to go directly to the word, but I'd like to maybe have you stand and sing, I feel the pull. I hear the call. And we need to today, I don't know just exactly how the service is going to go, but I would like to encourage you to just gather all of your thoughts. Say we lay everything else aside. We've come here because God, you know, God moved on you at some point in your life and you feel the pull. We're here to hear the call. Amen. Appreciated that prayer this morning, brother John. Felt a real response from the people. And uh you know, sometimes we come to the pulpit and we just know exactly how we're going to start and feel at least unless God moves in a special way how it's going to move through. But uh today I'm I'm just not that certain. So, I want you to really feel the pull and I want you to really pull on the on the It's not that I am uncertain. I could I I guarantee I could have you here for the next 3 hours with no problem. And so, that is my big problem just to have that down the way it should be. And uh I would like you to be mindful that there are there are decisions that are being made say in high places of authority places within the government or within the religious world. There are decisions being made. There are ide are ideas being put forward. There's motions being made within the Senate, within the parliament, whatever government it might be that are going to affect you down the road. You don't know anything about it right now. It hasn't come to the surface. It maybe hasn't come into play as yet, but you will feel its effects on down the road. I believe much of what brother Brham has brought because as a prophet spoke of things and now we're starting to see them. But there may be some things that are in motion yet that have not come into full effect, but you will they will come into effect. And I believe that there will be a squeeze, a spiritual squeeze, and perhaps an economic squeeze and whatever more. And and today uh you know I would like to just expose some of these things and with God's help may the Lord May the Lord help us. Let's just sing this chorus before we pray. I feel the Just give yourself to him now. I hear the call and his spirit moving me to give my all. Speak to me and I agree. Oh yes we do Lord Lord come &gt;&gt; take control. I feel the just once again prayerfully. I feel the Holy Spirit of God and thy spirit moving me to give my all. speaks to me and I agree. [Music] &gt;&gt; I feel the with our heads bowed. Gracious and loving heavenly father, we are here standing in your presence. And as we prayed a few moments ago in the study, what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him? But you have not only come to visit us, you have come to abide with us. You said, I will abide with you. I will be in you and you will be in me. Your messenger declared that this was that day. We agree and we say it again and again over and over. We agree that you are in us and we are in you and that this is the day of oneness. Bless not only those that are here but those that are streaming. How we feel a part of them and we desire they will feel a part of us Lord. And one day the barriers will be gone. One day time will be dissolved. One day, oh God, the curtain of time will drop and we will be together forever in your divine presence. And this veil of flesh will also drop. And we will so rejoice, oh God, that it's gone. and that we will be Lord unhindered and unfettered in your presence and with one another as we so desire to be. Bless now the word. Anoint us Lord. Anoint me I pray as I stand at this post of duty and your people as we move confidently in the hour that you have appointed us to live in in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Open your Bibles if you would please to uh Acts the 4th. Acts the 1st chapter and I'm also going to read from Matthew 16. Acts the first chapter at verse 4 just down through verse 11. and being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which saith he, you have heard of me. For John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence. When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel. And he said unto them, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in his own power, but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in Judea, and in Samaria, and under the uttermost part of the earth." And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven, as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel, and said, and also said, which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven, this same Jesus, which is taken up, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner, as ye have seen him go into heaven. I would like you to notice that when they asked, "Will you restore again the kingdom to Israel and he said that these were the things the times and the seasons which the father had put in his own power like you'd notice that word and then he said, "But you shall receive power." And he used two different words there. It is the father hath put this in his own jurisdiction and in his own authority. But you will receive power. You will receive dunamis. You'll receive power that will carry you through. &gt;&gt; And that's what he's speaking about. In Matthew the 16th chapter, Jesus is speaking to Peter and the disciples, but he addresses Peter and the 17th verse after Jesus had asked them, "Who do men say that I am?" And Jesus answered and said unto him to Peter, Blessed art thou Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father, which is in heaven, and I say unto thee that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. I want to speak on the power of revelation. We are uh we need to be empowered. Jesus said to the disciples, you shall receive power. You will be empowered. And the reason he said that is very obvious. They would need power. &gt;&gt; We need power. Amen. &gt;&gt; We need endurance. &gt;&gt; We are fascinated by power as humans. We're just automatically whether that power is exerted for good things or evil things. We are fascinated by it. We we see to see a man that is humanly very very strong. It's it's really quite amazing to see what a man might be able to lift or what a man might be able to do or what he might be able to endure. Or we see some machine or some piece of equipment and it's massive. It can do enormous things. It can do powerful things and we are uh we are attracted to that. We can't say that we're not. And when we see, you know, such things as uh at the space center, uh even I've never been there to to view it, but to see those rockets lift a spaceship or send some satellite, you you know, if you were there, you wouldn't be looking some other direction. You'd be fascinated at that millions of thrust of power coming out of the bottom of that rocket and sending this huge spacecraft into into orbit at uh thousands of miles an hour perhaps. I think they have to go about at least 25,000 m an hour to get it into its orbit. We would be fascinated by it. We'd be attracted by it. We're we're interested in things of power. When God allows nature to be released with enormous energy, whether it be by earthquake, whether it be by volcano, whether it be by storm, by wind, by tornado, by hurricane, by tsunami or whatever more. We are fascinated by the strength of power and how it is exerted and demonstrated and how it can change things in a very short period of time. We're interested in power. There are other kinds of power which are which are being uh which is being I would say exerted uh but it may be slow moving. It there are there is what we call there's chambers of power. There's halls of power. There's offices of power. We think of the power that man has taken to himself as uh leaders of countries and nations and groups of nations and how leaders have gotten together and and contrived to agree to exert power upon people. Unassuming people, people unaware, people not not not knowing what is taking place. But in the high some in high ranking office, they've come to a decision. Maybe just a handful of men have come to a decision of what they're going to do. And they they've they lay out their strategy and map out the and then make a decision uh of of that's going to affect multitudes and millions and millions of people. That is where I'm coming to this morning. Jesus said to Peter, he said that the gates of hell shall not prevail. I will build my church. I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And the word which he used there the gate uh it can be either in the wall of a city or a palace or a town or the temple or a prison. It can be likened to a vast prison. the access or entrance into any state. I don't know. I want to just uh just a moment. I want to just come back to it a moment. This is called St. Peter's Square. It's called St. Peter's Square. It may not be entirely what Jesus was talking about, but I believe that's the gates of hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, even the way it was constructed, it's called this, if you go to the Bureau of Tourism, they call these two two arms to embrace the people. I would say to hold the people. &gt;&gt; And then in here, this is an obelisk actually, which is from Egypt right in the center. and uh and and the whole encompassing uh office and position of this uh called St. Peter Square. It's not just a physical structure, but it's what takes place there &gt;&gt; and the decisions that are made there and the people. It is the who's who of the world. &gt;&gt; It's your leaders. I don't care whether you're from America or Canada or whether you're from Europe or the United Kingdom or wherever. The only country I think that has not had their leaders uh go there and they may well have gone there is China and some of the maybe some of the Asian countries, but they have gone there and decisions have been made that have affected their people dramatically. And there are leaders of the religious world that have gone there and we will refer a little bit more to it. Now I'm taking I showed you this picture a few days ago. This is the but I've added a little bit to it since I've been away. And the thing that I've added to it is that uh a nation is represented by their leader and when their leader has done made an act then God considers that nation to have be involved in that act. Not that all the people are but the nation as a nation. And because this was the first time in history that a United States president has gone to a funeral of a pope. This is not just a president. This is three presidents. It's not just three presidents, but two of them are Republican and one is Democrat. That is both the parties of the United States. That encompasses the entire United States. Now, Brother Brham was offered and uh uh I bl I believe it was Van Bloomberg uh had made an appointment for brother Brandham to visit the pope and the appointment was made for him to visit the pope. So, he was going to do that. Then he said he asked what must I do when I visit the pope? They said, "You'll need to kiss his ring and you need to bow down." He said, "I'm sorry, that's out. I'll call him brother if he wants to call me brother or if I'll call him brother or whatever, I'll give him any kind of uh respect and recognition. But to bow down, he said, would be an act of worship. And that, he said, is accepting the doctrine. bowing down and accepting the doctrine is exactly what the scripture says that they will commit fornication. &gt;&gt; This to me, my brother, my sister, is the very act of fornication. &gt;&gt; This has been spiritual fornication. America has formerly committed fornication with the Roman church &gt;&gt; and have drank of her cup &gt;&gt; and are intoxicated with the wine of her fornication. &gt;&gt; All right, you can shut that off if you would please. And it's going to take some power not to be affected by the things that are taking place. And the scripture says that all the earth, all whose names are not written in the lamb's book of life worshiped &gt;&gt; the beast. I personally believe that perhaps we have not uh visually seen all of it take place, but I believe we're right there. The scripture says, "We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." The words of our Lord Jesus to Apostle Paul when he met him on the road to Damascus. Jesus is addressing him and telling him what his commission will be. And he ends with these lines. to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith, that is faith that is in me, that they might be delivered from the power of Satan. There is a I tell you what friends this these uh things that took place in the last few days and one week ago was the inaugural uh inaugural service of the installation of the present pope who's taken place pope Benedict the 16th and uh uh he has been ready to say that he's going to continue the course of of uh unity etc. uh this thing that that is taking place has been prophesied by brother Brandham prophesied 30 and 40 years ago and his the prophecies are so distinct so accurate that I intend today to at least get enough in front of you so that you'll go home and uh uh you'd be wise to perhaps take a a message that's a rather difficult message which is feast of the trumpets but with your patience and with your cooperation, I want to go into that message with quite some detail today. And you'll see that there has been prophecies which have been prophesied back there and warnings which have been issued back there. And we are seeing those things happening right now. And we would be we would be well advised to really sharpen our spiritual senses up and to p pull up the traces and to make sure that things aren't slack in our lives because I also feel very very strongly about this. If we're sitting here today in our present environment in this present rather relaxed atmosphere and things are spoken out of the word of God and and we think well you know yeah it's it's it you know that is speaking to me. Yeah the Lord you know that kind of came to my address but somehow we just you know we managed to set it aside. We managed to uh relegate it to some lower you know place on our agenda. I'll just tell you for sure that for you will not stand the pressure that is going to come because there's going to be greater pressure. There going to be a time where you're going to have to decide to stand with the word or stand with your flesh or stand with whatever it is that has you know been in your uh uh kind of in your particular thing. And uh sometimes it it can be, you know, it can be money, it can be business, it can be education, it can be all kinds of things. All kinds of things. But we can we want to be assured that we're not giving uh uh we're not giving the the message and the things that God speaks to our heart second place. Now, I would also like you to notice that when the disciples asked, "Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?" I want you to catch that because this is a very, very similar question that we have on our minds. Lord, will you now are we at the time when you're going to restore fully the kingdom of God? Are we going to enter into the full promise of God? Uh is this the time of the rapture? Are we actually moving into this rapture cycle? We've heard it. We've heard it. And now they had good reason to believe this must be it. They'd seen the suffering. They saw the crucifixion. They saw how the word had been treated. They saw the nation rejected. We've seen the same thing. They had been considered an oddball little group of people. You're just a little offshoot. You're just off scouring. You're just a a little group of loose people. And uh uh you know and and and then Christ himself then uh suffered the cross and the death and the resurrection. And they were not believing in the resurrection. The the nation did not come forward and say he's he's risen. It was just those that he revealed himself to. It was still power of revelation. &gt;&gt; The whole nation never regarded him as resurrected. They they bought a lie. They paid for a lie. And the people believed a lie rather than believing the truth. They're believing a lie today. They're absolutely hoaxed. &gt;&gt; They're absolutely taken in. They're sucked in. &gt;&gt; I I look at some of the events that's happened in the last few days. I mean, we we become accustomed to it. You see it in the newspaper, see it in the magazine, you see it on the television or you see it on and hear it on the radio. But but when it's visual, when it's visual and you and you see all of this grandeur and and this pump and this ceremony and these hats and and whatever they call them and all of the robes for this occasion and that occasion, it's ludicrous. It's absolutely bizarre. And if we we would put on those hats, they would call you the nuttiest people in the world. But they put them on and everybody goes goooo. Uh-uh. It's just bizarre. It's absolutely wild. Who in the world invented that hat? It was borrowed, of course, they said from the Old Testament. Well, I can tell you that what they had in the Old Testament and all this, you know, it has to be scarlet for this occasion, has to be gold for this occasion, has to be, you know, it has to be a certain kind of ribbon, a certain kind of this and so many of this and so many of that and on and on and on. And it's absolutely wild. &gt;&gt; Just nonsense to the utmost degree that they can ever take Peter, the humble, illiterate fisherman, and and get this out of it. I mean that is that is the wildest imagination that you you can't even get there. &gt;&gt; You cannot associate the two. But you know today we don't think a whole lot of it. But don't underestimate the power of that beast. &gt;&gt; That they got they got they got plans for you. &gt;&gt; They've got plans for you. They've got plans. Don't think for a minute they don't know about this message. Don't think for a minute. I've already heard years ago that they have the church ages right in the Vatican file. That is people who've been there said they've got the church ages there. I bet they have the seals there. I wouldn't be a bit surprised to have a whole set of uh of the library of the books there. I wouldn't be a bit surprised. They got scholars just studying these things all the time. How long would it take for your name to be identified in their computer or the computer system? How long would it take for them to identify you as a believer of this message who believe this kind of thing? &gt;&gt; How long would it take for your nation to identify you and say you you're a believer of hate literature? &gt;&gt; They do it in a few weeks. &gt;&gt; You'd all be down there. If you're identified if you own a gun, you're identified if you drive a car. You're identified if you own a home. You're on this tax role. And you're identified here. You're identified if you got a medical card. If you got medical insurance, you're identified. They got so much information on you, you can't even you can't even think about it. &gt;&gt; You can't even imagine it. I got a card here right here. I don't want to I'm going to put my finger over the picture. It's a terrible picture. I was I was upset when I took this picture and I looked like it too. It's up. Give me that card and get this thing over with. But implanted in this plastic here is a whole bunch of information. Implanted in that plastic is is my I think my passport number and and all kinds of details. And I just wave this thing in in front of a another piece of plastic. And the guy in the office, he just looks at what's coming up on the screen. &gt;&gt; They know all about you. &gt;&gt; They know the color of your eyes. And without even looking at the picture, they know they got all kinds of information about you. And it wouldn't take any length of time. Believe me, &gt;&gt; it would take zero amount of time. And they probably have everything in place to identify you already as a believer this message. &gt;&gt; And when the disciples were asking this, they had a good reason to ask it. They had a very good reason to ask it because now he had resurrected and they thought now things are moving in a positive direction. He has been resurrected. Oh, will you now restore the kingdom? Is this what we've been waiting for? No. In fact is he said it's not for you to know the time or the season that the father has put in his own jurisdiction under his own authority. But you will receive power. They didn't know how badly they needed that because soon after this the very power of Rome which was in control of their nation now was going to come down with a heavy hand. They were going to besiege Jerusalem. And if they had not been believers of the message, they too would have been trapped in Jerusalem. But because they were believers of the message, the prophet said, "Not one of them were caught in that city." But this nation, this nation, this same power, because this is the identical power, it's just changed its mask. It was pagan Rome which slew them by the hundreds of thousands till the blood ran out of the city. All of that cruelty I'm standing here publicly today declaring all of that cruelty still is under her skirts. &gt;&gt; All of that wickedness has not changed one iota. And he said there exactly the same spirit that was in pagan Rome simply took on a new uh a new identity as papal Rome. &gt;&gt; It has not changed. And so now here we are. Here we are. There was another era where these same people called the Jews became dispersed throughout the world. And they were dispersed in all countries all over the world. Be it South America, Russia, Soviet Union, formerly all nations of the world, even into the Muslim countries of Iraq and Iran and and down through the Arab nations and North Africa and so on. Jews were scattered all over and they became uh citizens of those countries. They held passports of those nations. They were identified. They were there for generations. They were there. They had uh they had their families and on on extended families. They had their businesses. They had their farms. Farms that had been handed down from generation to generation. And then when the end time came, now the brother Brandham says in the in the feast of the trumpets, he said those those spirits 200,000,000 horsemen which were held at the river Euphrates. Now it's very interesting that the river Euphrates was the eastern boundary of the Roman Empire. They and he said they could not cross into the promised land. They could not come into the promise. Now, and but it was the eastern boundary of the Roman Empire and that's as far as they could go. And the prophet says those 200,000,000 horsemen, he said they're not there isn't that many horsemen in the world. Said it's not a horsemen. A horse in the scripture is a power. A power. And he said these powers, he said they were chargers. He said they were demon spirits. There were spiritual forces, powers that were held there. And he said they were held there uh and under under uh uh traditions. They were bound by certain traditions. Now, you have to really put your mind to work now. And so the the Roman church, the Roman church, it wasn't what we have today, but they had traditions and and it it was it was it was not the Roman Catholic Church as such that had armies in power to go out and destroy, but they would consent to certain things. Now, just watch a moment and then I'm going to I'm going to read quotes as I come on, but he said the traditions held them. They were bound by traditions. See, and then he said they were loosed by dictators. Now he said in the scripture it says they received power as kings. Do you recall the scripture? They received power as kings. They were not kings. He says they were dictators. A Mussolini and a Stalin and a Hitler. They they had power as a king, but they were not kings. And that is why that is why the Roman church remained silent while these fellas went and did their business. &gt;&gt; And he said that these chargers, these these persecution forces were loosed under the dictators. And he calls it he calls it in one place the trumpet the trumpet of persecution &gt;&gt; because it actually was one of the trumpets that was being blown. You always think that we'll say well the feast of the trumpets oh something marvelous going to happen. You can't it's it's hard to relate. That's why I want you to think now. It's hard to relate that when that trumpet was being blown the people, it was a trumpet of persecution and those forces which was the old pagan Rome. The same power that they had back there and under pagan Rome slew millions of martyrs of the early Christians. But now they had been bound. He said for almost 2,000 years they'd been bound, but they were released under the dictators. And that is why the Roman church and the papacy and everything remained silent. They gave consent by silence to the thing that was taking place by the dictators because they were in agreement with the thing because it was the same spirit. And in fact, the prophet said that Rome was being revived. They were having I will put it this way. It was the false bride's revival. &gt;&gt; The false bride. Look at not very many years ago. Many of you here are young, but some of you have a few years under your shoe leather. And it was during your time. I can tell you that what has been happening in the within the powers and office of the Roman church has changed so dramatically and so quickly that even even the Catholic people themselves many have resented what the liberalization what they call the liberalization but they don't know what is being schemed and hatched out the liberalization is to swallow it up. &gt;&gt; So these here we are today and I feel like maybe I'm speaking to a lot of spiritual Jews &gt;&gt; and you've got your homes and you've got your profession and you've got your business. It would be like before the trumpet of persecution, someone standing up in a synagogue and saying, "Listen, folks." Uh there there's there's there's things that are moving there. There's there's undercurrents here. There are things which are uh maybe not real good signals. Uh uh we've had a we've had a prophet and he has told us that these things were going to happen. They say, "What are you talking about? We've been here for we've been here for years. We've been here, in fact, is we've been here for centuries. &gt;&gt; We've been established. My great-grandfather had this business, had this farm. We've been here. My neighbors, I got the most wonderful neighbors. And you're trying to tell them there's a holocaust coming. &gt;&gt; They just said, "You have gone bazoon. &gt;&gt; We have wonderful friends here." &gt;&gt; And we've got passports and we've got identification. and our kids are in school and my my young people are going to college and then we we got thing everything's going fine, everything's looking great. We feel real positive about the future. But the word of God had declared that he was going to call them back. They never do you listen to me now? They never dreamed in their wildest imagination that a trumpet would be blown under persecution. But the good part of that was God was going to use the extreme to get them back. &gt;&gt; And if you're a son and daughter of God, he's going to use the extreme to get you in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You might be able to get along and say, "Well, I can kind of hang loose and I can kind of think what I want to think. I can kind of, you know, go my own way." Yeah, the Lord's kind of talking me about it, but I mean, I'll leave it for another time. If you are a son and daughter of God, God is going to act. He's going to work on your case. And you'd be far better to feel the pull now and answer the call now than to wait for that time. and tried to warn the Jews not very many years ago not very many years ago had tried to tell them there is a terrible persecution coming because because we're not where we're supposed to be. You know, we're not supposed to be here in Poland. We're not supposed to be here in Germany. We're not supposed to be here in Russia. We're not supposed to be here in the United States. We're supposed to be in Israel. And it says in the scripture, and we can read it in here in in our Bible in the Torah, we can read where our God Jehovah said, "I'm going to drive you back. I'm going to get you back in your land." And if they had said, "It's written in the word, I'm going to get you back in the land," they might have said, "Well, yeah, but you know, we've been here for a long, long time. We're established here. How we, you know, we can't we can't really do it." God knew how to do it and he did do it. And God knows how to get you, how to get your profession in second place, how to get your education on down the line and how to get everything else that concerns you and seems to be number one. He'll get it where it belongs. &gt;&gt; And he'll get himself number one in your life somehow or other. [Music] They could never dream that there was such cruelty that there was such an enormous cruelty which was awaiting them. They couldn't believe it. And the disciples when they were asking Jesus, are you ready to establish the kingdom? No, it was completely the other way. &gt;&gt; They're going to completely lose the kingdom &gt;&gt; as far as the as far as the outward and physical was concerned. I'm not talking about the spiritual kingdom, but they he little did they realize that such enormous cruelty still laid within the heart of Rome, pagan Rome at that time. And then they wrote in and they tried to withstand and we have a mada and we have the places where they took a stand and tried to resist and were just just crushed. &gt;&gt; They didn't realize that that was there. And Jesus didn't detail it for him. He didn't say, "Look, this is what's going to happen. I want to inform you. I want to put you on the inside track. This is really what's going to happen." He didn't tell them that. He just said, "But you will receive power." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You will receive power. I'd like to ask you people today, have you received that power? Have you received that Holy Ghost? Is he the one who's guiding your life? Is he the one who's directing your life? Is he the one who who is who who is giving is he your wisdom? Is he your decision maker? &gt;&gt; That's what I want to ask. It might do well if you'd like to turn in your Bibles to Deuteronomy 28. Deuteronomy 28 uh speaks concerning the blessings of the land if they shall heed the word of God. But if they did not, the conditions which would bring curses and chastisement. But we he gets very much more specific if we get down to about verse 49. And the Lord shall bring a nation against thee from from far from the end of the earth as swift as the eagle flieth. A nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand. And now listen to this prophecy coming through the prophet Moses to these people saying if you will heed the word you'll be blessed. But if you don't heed the word, if you will not accept the word, then then this is the kind of result that's going to happen. and a nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young. And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed, which also shall not leave thee either corn, wine, or oil, or the in or the increase of thy kind, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee. and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates. And Rome is the only one that besieged Israel in all their gates. &gt;&gt; They completely encompass them. And this is nothing less than a prophecy of this same this same nation, pagan back then, prophesying of their pagan destruction, but now it's a spiritual thing. And they've got it is the same demons. &gt;&gt; You need to say amen to it. It is the same demons. Don't think it's some far away distant place. You had a prophet messenger who spelled it out in great detail of what their plan was. And that's what you need to read and understand. &gt;&gt; And I'm helping you hopefully to understand today and perhaps this weakness of of you know of speech and so on, but you just try to get it, please. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustest throughout all thy land, and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the Lord thy God hath given thee. And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons, and of thy daughters, which the Lord thy God hath given thee in the siege, and in the straightness wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee. And the prophet said, they ate their their children. &gt;&gt; And the prophet Moses is telling them that they will do it. And I guarantee you when they looked at their little lovely ones, they and heard the words of the prophet, they could not believe that anything that God would allow happen to them. We're God's elect. We're God's chosen. But if they would not heed the word of God, God will take whatever measures are necessary to make you and them believe in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that the man that is tender among you and very delicate, his eyes shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children, which he shall leave, even the attraction and the love of husband and wife would fail them because of the distress that Rome would put upon them. And so that he will not give he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat because he hath nothing left nothing left him in the siege and in the straightness wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates. The tender and delicate woman among you which would not adventure to set the soul of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness. Her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter, and toward her young, one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children, which she shall bear. For she shall eat them. for want of all things secretly in the siege and straightness wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates. If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, the Lord thy God. And the people said, &gt;&gt; that's God's word. &gt;&gt; That's absolutely God's truth. &gt;&gt; Do you acknowledge that? Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't want to just acknowledge it when it speaks all wonderful nice things. We want to acknowledge it because these prophecies are absolutely the truth. &gt;&gt; And there's coming there's coming a time that may be very very soon upon us which is called a tribulation period. And that tribulation period is going to make anything that has come up up to this time like kindergarten stuff. It's going to be the same spirits. They've been they have been held back &gt;&gt; as the Roman powers were held back by their traditions. See, the church was in power for a lot of years, but they were held back because they had their robes and their ecclesiastical things and their traditions and things. They weren't people to go out and they weren't released. They didn't have a release to go out and slaughter the people. But the spirits which were guiding that church was murderous. &gt;&gt; And so and so those spirits caught into the those men that were dictators that were given power as kings, but they weren't crowned. They didn't have a crown, the scripture says, but they were given power as kings. And when they went out and exercised these powers, all of this holiness and all the rest of it were in absolute favor of what was taking place because it was the spirit that was bound by those traditions which was released from the traditions by cruel men. &gt;&gt; And those demons guided those dictators to accomplish the church's purpose. &gt;&gt; I hope I'm making it clear. But to get people to understand and of and we of all people from all the ages, there's some cunning things that are taking place. Now, let me just go back a wee bit. If we go pre the second world war and you say, well, the Jewish people have been established and I don't need to enlarge on that. They they had their farms. They had their businesses. They had all of these things for them to imagine even uh the the crushing persecution which a prophet has called the trumpet of persecution. And that was the feast of what was the feast part of it. You mean 6 million of them uh being uh cremated was a feast. It was a feast in that they could not be blessed till they would get back in their homeland. And it took that to get them back. And getting them back was the feast. &gt;&gt; The holocaust or the persecution wasn't the feast. He said that was the trumpet, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That blasted &gt;&gt; under those dictators. It blasted &gt;&gt; until it would get those people back where they belong. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends. And we've had seals opened and the seals are equal to the seals are equal to the trumpets. The trumpets are to Israel and the seals are to the Gentiles. And the seals have been open. Maybe we haven't even acknowledged it. They they they heard all about the trumpets, but they didn't see it happen. &gt;&gt; They didn't see anything taking place. So why should they be concerned about You've heard about the seals being open. What does it mean? You don't even know. But if the things which are written in there start to happen and take place, you'll be very very interested in what it says. &gt;&gt; All right. Now the old Roman Empire being revived. I'm reading now if you'll just have give me your attention from I'm reading from Revelation 9 and 13. And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar, which is before God, saying in the saying to the sixth angel, which had the trumpet, loose the four angels, which are bound in the great river Euphrates. See, that's as far as Rome. That was their farthest boundary. Now just for a moment the river Euphrates is one. There was a river that flowed through Eden and then it went into four heads. Four different rivers went out from that river. So you and the fourth one was e was Euphrates. You know, God has such a master plan, a hope that we can even get even if we get a snibble or two or a crumb or two, it will be sufficient. &gt;&gt; But so Euphrates was in Eden. Euphrates when a Roman power took control of the land that Jesus would walk on, as far as they could go was Euphrates. And they were bound there. That was as far as they could go. and their evil work. Now, the scripture doesn't speak about everything they did to all other countries, but the scripture is in great detail of what they did to Palestine and how they dealt with God's people. See, you are God's inheritance. &gt;&gt; Jacob is my people. &gt;&gt; God loved fatherhood. &gt;&gt; You are the the result of his love for fatherhood. He wanted sons. He wanted daughters. He wanted a family. And brother Brandham says in Christ the mystery of God revealed. That was the first thing that he wanted to do was to express himself. That was the first thing he wanted to do. And the first expression that he refers to that he wanted to express was he said because he loved fatherhood. And he said he could only manifest that through the son of man. That is why when Jesus came as the son of man, God was expressing himself as a father. That was the first thing he wanted to do. He wanted to express himself, but he wanted to express himself as father. And so when the first first begotten of God came onto the earth as God, that's what he this what he said. This is my beloved son &gt;&gt; in whom I am well pleased. This is my beloved son. He wanted to be known to the people. I am a father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And through this firstborn, I will bring forth many sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you are here today if you believe the word of God as I think you do. You are here today. And I'm announcing to you, you are here as the result of Almighty God, the creator of heavens and earth, desiring with his first desire to have children, &gt;&gt; to have offspring, to have an attribute of his own being expressed here on the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And more than that, he's allowed us to come at this time and to be this kind of light, this kind of uh manifestation of his attribute in the face of his arc enemy, Lucifer. &gt;&gt; And there they are. Hallelujah. Try to deceive her if you want. You can't deceive her. &gt;&gt; She's she can't be deceived because she's an attribute of mine. and I'll make myself known to her in such a way that you won't be able to deceive her. &gt;&gt; You can try and attract her. You can try and enchant her. Do whatever you want, but you'll not be you'll not succeed. And I'll just uh there there she is. &gt;&gt; She's on display. &gt;&gt; Bound in the great river Euphrates. How are you going to figure that one out without a prophet? And the fourth angels, the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year to slay the third part of men. And the number of the army of horsemen were 200,000,000. And I heard the number of them, chargers, spiritual chargers. that had been bound under this pagan system but would be released and pagan Rome would become papal Rome. The old Roman Empire had been bound for almost 2,000 years and it was revived and loosed through the power of the dictators in the feast of the trumpets. I'm just I'm giving you this now. Notice over in the Bible where they received power as kings but wasn't crowned a dictator's not a crown king but just just receives power as a king. Now uh I did tell a little bit about Eden. I'm going to go directly to the feast of the trumpets. For those of you who'd want to make a note down, this is on page 23. I'm going to go slowly now. He says, "Note in Revelation the 9th chapter in the 13th verse, the sixth trumpet, there was 200,000 horsemen that had been bound in the river Euphrates was turned loose under the sixth trumpet." Now, many of the things I might be saying say, "Well, I I I don't know. I'm not following you. Just hang in there. Just hang in there. Just hold it. Catch it as a lesson. They were loosed under the sixth trumpet. A trumpet is always to call the people together. Or the trumpet is for an announcement. The trumpet there was the feast of uh and and the and remember now I'm just my mind is going faster than I can speak. But the the trumpet that is sounding now, he's calling them. And the trumpet that was released, the trumpet of persecution which was released, persecution of the Jews was sounded and blasted out to take call them back. For a trumpet is to call them call the people to an announcement or something. And it called them back to their own country. And that trumpet sound was so loud, so clear, so commanding that even though they had left their homes, they had left their lands, the war was over, the persecution, the the world's telling them it's all over now. And they didn't want to go back. We don't want to go back. We want to now the blast was so strong. I just want to go home. I want to go back to my land that they hadn't been hardly given yet. 1948 hadn't rolled around. The United Nations hadn't voted and made him a nation. But we want to go back. It was so powerful. I'm telling you, my brother, my sister, God knows how to dig down into your life and make you homesick for heaven &gt;&gt; and make you very unhappy with the best that this life can give you. I don't care what you have in this life. It it it doesn't even it's not even a snap compared to what God has for you and you might have to fight your way there. And they got there on boats and were turned back said go to Cyprus. We're going to put you in another concentration camp. But they could not lose their desire. Not because how did that happen with hundreds of thousands of people? How did that happen? It was a supernatural blast &gt;&gt; of God's trumpet. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they couldn't escape it. &gt;&gt; And God knows how to bring us around. He know how to deal with natural Israel. He sure knows how to deal with us. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help me to help me to say it. Help me to preach it. Help you to get it. &gt;&gt; He said, "They weren't natural horses. They breathed fire and they had breastplates of jasper. They had tails and the ends of the tails looked like a serpent. A snake's head on the end of it stinging. It was spiritual horses, spiritual devils, chargers that had been bound in the Euphrates all these years. Supernatural devils. What was it? He says, "What was all this?" Now maybe you don't know the you don't know what the uh symbol is because it is so rich and deep in symbolism. You have to have a prophet. You'll get nowhere without a prophet. And he said he asked what was it? Nobody would ever tell you this. You won't get this any other book. And here it is right here. It is the old Roman Empire being revived. The persecution of the Jews. So they were being revived. Hallelujah. The old Roman Empire was being revived under the persecution. And I can just tell you, I just showed you a picture where the the presidents of the most powerful nation on earth bowing in front of that power, &gt;&gt; the demised &gt;&gt; pope. And he talks about the beast that was and the beast that is and is yet to come. He said that's the succession of popes from one to the other. He said in pagan Rome the king died and there was no more king. Maybe another one could come but he couldn't be in the same power. Look at where where's pagan Rome today? It doesn't exist. &gt;&gt; They could have king after king after king but they didn't follow with the same authority in the same power. But because this this demon force has has traced itself and gives itself authenticity from being back in in Peter &gt;&gt; saying we're from Peter and we have a solid connection all the way through and it passes from one to the other. The beast that was is the same as the beast that is. And this beast is the same as one that's going to come. &gt;&gt; And they just take the mantle of the last one and go forward with the same power and the same authority because it's a beast power and it's a spiritual thing. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you that when brother Brandham spoke this, they wouldn't even have a pope come to America. They wouldn't allow him on the on the front lawn or in the rose garden or in the oval office. They would not allow him there. But Eli but but when Elijah was here, I'll tell you another Ahab was here also. And Ahab opened the door for Rome. &gt;&gt; And a Time magazine said that President Kennedy opened the door. And they said it would have even been thought that a pope could come in the back door, but now they said he can come in the front door. And this beast power has has been so magnificent and so grand that it has swept in the most powerful nation on earth &gt;&gt; and had their presidents scandalous. &gt;&gt; Bow in front of that dead carcass. &gt;&gt; I'm not even American. &gt;&gt; But neither am I Canadian. &gt;&gt; I'm Christian. I'm a believer. I have my passport in heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I got my citizenship in another country. And my heart yearns for that country. I don't care what kind of a boat they put you on and say you can't get there yet. You can't you got to go through this. You got to whatever we have to go through. So be it. We'll go through it cuz we're going home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; Who go with me to my father's house? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's the old Roman Empire. He said, "And they'd been bound for nearly 2,000 years of the river Euphrates can't cross to the promise, a religious sect that was trying to get to the other side. Uh Euphrates, you know, came through Eden, but they were bound there for 2,000 years. 2 thou 200,000 devils of persecution. And notice what happens. I'm just taking certain segments. Notice what happens under the sixth trumpet. They were turned loose on the Jews. The persecution of the Jews, supernatural devils. Now I want you to understand that's why I've been preaching here even even pre going to Awitzen since that it we we are not of one nation or another nation. This wasn't one nation or another nation. This wasn't just Mussolini or Hitler and Stalin. These were supernatural devils. &gt;&gt; Nobody can even imagine the kind of atrocities and human suffering that those pe it wasn't those men that brought it. It was a demon that inspired them. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't just Jews. There were others. &gt;&gt; I read things and there are people who really withstand the the Roman power and Romans it is and the papacy and all the rest of it. They're absolutely livid with the things that take place and all the rest of it. And when they took the Jews, they didn't just take Jews to the various camps. There was there were uh uh Jehovah's Witnesses. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. There were Polish people. Polish people were the first ones to die in Ashwitz, British soldiers, Russian soldiers. Homosexuals were taken in and many were slain. There were other groups that were taken in. There might be other groups that were taken in, but as far as God was concerned, he blew the trumpet for one people. And as far as the seals are concerned, he opened them for one people. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Look how the prophet cried out against this marology and this worship of women. How he screamed about it. And now here are the leaders of the world. so enamored and so taken in by the events of the last 2 three weeks in the Vatican City. It is reported applause rang out as John Paul's simple wooden coffin adorned with a cross and an M for Mary. That is blasphemous. Amen. &gt;&gt; The cross that my savior suffered and died and gave the blood of the newly created blood by almighty God quad blood like no man had. This was a new creation &gt;&gt; and suffered under that agony and gave his blood as a sacrifice. No man takes my life. I lay it down. I'll take it up again. Here comes now a leader that is has the world bowing before him putting a big M with a cross. &gt;&gt; There's no part of the suffering. &gt;&gt; Even the Lord himself call her call her woman. &gt;&gt; Speak to John. Take care of her. She had to go to Pentecost &gt;&gt; to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Her womb was just a incubator. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan took Eve's head and God took Mary's womb &gt;&gt; and gave us a savior. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Jesus said, "Woe unto you scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites." Now, I'm I'm reading this in connection to how how how they bind people to the traditions and their creeds. It's phenomenal. And Jesus said, "Woe to you Pharisees, hypocrites, for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men. For you neither go in yourselves, and neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. &gt;&gt; Now, neither could these go in. They were bound by ecclesiastical powers, traditions, and creeds. Now, I I I don't know if you probably just won't catch it just immediately, but I I think I've established that the pagan system, it was bound and Rome who had become papal Rome had become an ecclesiastical system. The system I talked about power now I'm talking about the power of the system. It's incredible. &gt;&gt; How do you hold? How do you even imagine? How do you fathom holding 1 billion people? It's the power of the system. Amen. &gt;&gt; They may have little different beliefs and ideas, but the system, the actual structure of the system holds the souls of 1 billion people walking on the face of the earth and and controls the thoughts of hundreds of millions more. &gt;&gt; You got to give me a little while. He said in the feast of the trumpets on page 24 he said there's that Roman Empire bound there by what? By ecclesiastical powers. Powers. Ecclesiastical stuff has power to it. And he said they're bound by ecclesiastical powers. The Roman Empire bound by ecclesiastical powers which Rome, pagan Rome become papal Rome and was bound there in its traditions of Christian. Listen very close. It was bound there in its tradition of Christian or what part of Christian and superstition. So what part of Christian they had adopted? They're bound by that because they made a tradition out of it. You know, let me just drop this in. Brother Bram says when God send the people a prophet and then they make a tradition out of their prophet, &gt;&gt; they build a tradition and make a tradition and the tradition begins to bind the people rather than the very word that the messenger brought. &gt;&gt; The word is Christ. We're married to Christ, &gt;&gt; not on some traditional I'm a believer. You Mal Malachi 4, Luke 17:30 and all of that. That's not it. It's what are we living? &gt;&gt; That's what it is. And he says they were by what part of Christian tradition and superstitions it had of Rome &gt;&gt; putting together all these worship of women and all these other kind of stuff and Christian Christmas days and holidays and holy days and things. It's bound by that tradition and it cannot let loose. &gt;&gt; It can't let loose of those traditions. It can't let loose. I hope you're understanding me. It can't let loose of those traditions because it is those traditions that give them the power to hold the people in a false religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So they can't let loose of them. &gt;&gt; But they have murder in their heart. &gt;&gt; The spirit that dominates them is against God's people. And in their mind, the Jews are a problem. And so they fabricate, "The Jews killed Jesus." &gt;&gt; And the Jews say, "The Romans, you killed them." &gt;&gt; And that has been their centuries old argument. But you know what? Of all things, they're solving it just now. &gt;&gt; They're solving it just now. We won't say you killed him anymore. And Israel says, "Okay, if you do that, we'll play on the same block. We won't say you killed him." &gt;&gt; Stupid people. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he was God's lamb. &gt;&gt; God sacrificed him &gt;&gt; cuz God knew he's going to raise him up again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he says, "The same ungodly pagan spirit." And listen to this now. He stops. Listen close. And he says, "And that spirit, whatever I've described to you now, he said, "And that spirit caught into the nations of the world." That spirit. And that is why now there comes just little things that you've never heard before rising up in America and in this country. Oh uh we got you know these problem these people uh it comes from the religious right. They've coined little cute phrases and what they're really saying is believers of the Bible, &gt;&gt; people who believe the whole scripture, &gt;&gt; they've got you identified now. And that's the first thing they did to bring under the trumpet to bring the Jews to their persecution. They had to first identify which group they're going to single out. &gt;&gt; And that demon that was directing them was saying that's the group. They're not the only people who are giving us trouble because in Germany there were German people who gave them trouble &gt;&gt; and they had lots of them in prison because they were political prisoners. And some of those, believe it or not, even German people went to the German concentration camp and were under the SS troops. &gt;&gt; You're silent. I hope you're getting what I'm saying. There were a lot of groups that were giving those people problem, but there was one group that gave them a lot of problem because those people held the testimony of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, well, there's a lot of fundamentals. There a lot of people out here that give us trouble, but there is one group. They dress different &gt;&gt; and they act different and they've got a different air about them and they're not the same even to these other fundamentals and while we don't care for these others but these people really give us problem and look what they say and I can hear it coming from the inner sanctums of the Vatican saying to leaders that would bow before their dead pole &gt;&gt; you have a people there trouble to us. &gt;&gt; We want you to fix the problem. &gt;&gt; Shut them down. &gt;&gt; In fact, it would please us if you made their churches warehouses. &gt;&gt; It would please us if you make sure they're not on the internet anymore. &gt;&gt; These things that they're saying about us are really by your own by your own laws illegal. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. You know what? We'd suddenly find ourselves in a strange problem. You brothers that are police upholders of the law, you'd find yourself where John in China is after arresting us and feeling so despondent over it because in inside he did not want but the power of the system said arrest them. Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Who do you listen to? &gt;&gt; The system or your heart? &gt;&gt; They'd love to have more children. Can you have a Why don't you have another child? Oh, he said that's not possible. Why? It's against the law. Oh, so now it's the system. &gt;&gt; You're going to bow to one or the other. As far as I'm concerned, I think it's time we we don't wait till the future, but we settle it right now. I bow to this and this alone. &gt;&gt; I pledge allegiance to the lamb and to the lamb alone. [Music] And that spirit caught into the nations of the world according to the prophecies of Ezekiel and the rest of them. And they were loosed upon the Jew who knew nothing of that spirit. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Knew nothing of that spirit. And there's your mysteries hid under the seal there. &gt;&gt; Amen. As I said earlier, that is why when you hear and see things uh and one of the things that came up that if you followed news at all, that's one of the things that you know became quite prominent at this time was here's the 60th anniversary of Awitz and soon after this Pope hope goes and another one comes and there's a whole lot of things that are happening and things that are happening for the first first time for the first time. Putout &gt;&gt; is now in has just visited Israel for the first time &gt;&gt; that a Russian leader has visited &gt;&gt; first time. And when Russia goes down there for that oil and he wants to set up his own road map to peace because he feels that Bushes isn't working and he would like to make himself as some leader in that area for influence. Friends, there's things happening. You just pull up to the pumps and say, "Wow, the gas is a dollar a liter, whatever more." But there's forces and there's things that are completely out of our control, but we don't care. Like the Jews there, they didn't know nothing about it. We don't know nothing about it. &gt;&gt; We don't care. This world's not our home. &gt;&gt; I'm just passing through. &gt;&gt; Move out of my way. I'm headed home. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can I have a few more few more minutes? Now, brother Brandham, some of this going to be shocking, but I just want you to pay strict attention. I'm not going to read all this. I'm just going to read a few lines, but listen very close. Brother Brandham talked about David Duplly perhaps between se 70 and 100 times in the message. David Duploy from Africa from South Africa is a great scholarly man and he was with brother Brandham on the platform. He arranged meetings for him. He was in Jeffersonville. He was on the platform. Brother Brandham calls him a great friend. And then down finally when it got to about 1963 in the message, Souls that are in prison, in fact is it's not souls that are in prison. That's not the that's not the message title. It's souls that are in prison now. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham's crying out. He says the council of churches over there that's meeting in Rome. This circular letter that my good friend David Duples when I sat there and I cried to him about it in in in 14 mile creek. There was a certain place they were at not long ago. Not realizing that he swung the church right into Babylon. &gt;&gt; Right. when everybody's saying, "Oh, all the churches are going to be one now." Yeah, I know that. Just exactly what's wrote on my book of prophecy in 1933. 19 and 33. Listen, friends, can you put things together? That was right when the Nazi power was was devising a a what they were going to do when they got into power. &gt;&gt; They were just coming into power. And here for coming against a natural Jew. And here was God devising his plan to release upon the bride so that we who would come along and years later would be free from the bondage of the system. [Music] &gt;&gt; And he says it would take place. He says, "Why don't you realize that Satan's uniting together?" The Bible says that. And just after a bit, just a little while, as soon as they become one, then he notice as soon as they become one, he was saying, be declaring plainly, they aren't yet. But he also is prophesying they will. &gt;&gt; Now, if they hadn't happened, well, I wouldn't be standing here. But what he prophesied just in straight statements &gt;&gt; happening one after the other. &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not drowning you. Ark of the beast rise. &gt;&gt; David Duples. I'd like to have had this all on a on a overhead for you and then you could read it, but you you just have to try to catch it. David Dupacy, one of the key men, this this is not a quote now. This is of his life. Just a few lines. One of the key men in bringing together Pentecostalism and Catholics. This is this is read of him and attribute to him. By the 1950s, Duples became immersed in the task of ecumenism. He preached that God was pouring out the latter reign power just preceding Christ's return. He became friends with the modernistic leaders of the world council of churches and participated in the second assembly of the WCC world council of churches in 1954 and in the third assembly in 1961. Now, brother Brandham cried out against him just before 1963. He had been his friend sitting with him and so on. He said he was invited to the Vatican to speak personally with Pope John the 23d and was the only Pentecostal invited to attend the only Pentecostal invited to attend the Vatican 2 council of the mid 1960s. In his biography he testified that his heart broke and he literally wept during the performance of the Catholic mass. is a man who got brother Brandham into South Africa &gt;&gt; when he met with 24 modernistic ecumenical leaders in 1956 for example he said he felt a warm glow come over him oh how he needed the message the greatest battle ever fought to find out it has nothing to do with a warm glow &gt;&gt; it has to do with what the word of God has declared it only what the word of God and what you have in your emotions. You might have had a warm glow. You might have one now. Don't even pay any attention to it. Or you might say, "Your message is leaving me cold. Don't pay any attention to that. It's not whether it leaves you warm or leaves you cold. It's whether that's sayeth the Lord or not. That's what counts. Has nothing to do with how you're feeling. Has nothing to do with it brought a tear to your eye or left you dryed. It has nothing to do with that. It has to do with whether it's a truth of God's word or not. And he said he felt a warm glow come over him. Look at what the warm glow did for him. And his attitude of judging doctrine melted away. These are his own words. &gt;&gt; A warm glow came over him and the and and his attitude of judging doctrine melted away. A warm glow caused doctrine to become nonimportant. &gt;&gt; He said, "I felt such love and compassion for those ecclesiastical leaders that I would rather have died for them than pass sentence upon them." And he contra he contrasted that with the old days when he would have denounced their false doctrine. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Those were his old days. He said when he first visited Vatican, Dupacy claimed that a similar experience caused his prejudice against Catholicism to melt away so that thereafter he could readily accept priests as brothers in Christ without any judgmentalism whatsoever regarding their doctrine through powerful. I want you to hang on. I got another 10 minutes or so and I want you to listen very very close. Notice now through doctrine he the thing of doctrine melted away. Brother Brandham says I got the quote. I haven't got the time to read it to you. He says you will have to surrender your fundamental teachings &gt;&gt; for this unity for this oneness to take place. And here he's saying and he's the leader of it of the movement. And he says without any judgmental whatsoever regarding their doctrine and through powerful emotional experiences at mass during the Vatican 2 council duplic doctrine. So now the doctrine and this is a man that is leading the last church &gt;&gt; age Pentecostalism back to mana. &gt;&gt; And folks, this isn't history. You're living in it. &gt;&gt; This is what's happening. And now now I'm going to read to you what the Catholic theologians and leaders declare about the same movement. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So the one the movement on one a warm glow on the Pentecostals cuz that's what they experienced. And here a prophet if they'd listened to him said the speaking in tongues and all of the shaking and all of this thing that's not the evidence. He said it's a evidence but it's not the evidence of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You can speak in English and have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You can. And now here's from the postvatican itself in an ecumenical response to the neopentecostal movement that spread in evangelical and liberal circles in the Catholic faith. says that a baptism of the Holy Spirit including speaking in tongues was evidenced by a Roman Catholic retreat at uh Dukeine or whatever university in 1967 and it spread to Southbend Indiana and to Ann Arbor then over the world. At first the movement was viewed with extreme caution. I've said to you over this pulpit many times that at the first world council of churches meeting which was 1948 when Israel was established because here come a prophet saying it's uniting time everything's uniting churches are uniting Israel is uniting the nations are uniting &gt;&gt; and here of course the same spirit's on these people are you with me &gt;&gt; and and at those first meeting the Catholic Church was not a part. I have the three there's only three denominations are part but there were 147 represented in the first meeting and the Catholics were not part of it. They were only observers. I just want you to see friends where they've gone from observers &gt;&gt; to controllers. &gt;&gt; From observers to controllers. from one who couldn't get into the White House, couldn't get onto the lawn, now comes in and tells the president what to do. &gt;&gt; And here's what they say. It was with extreme caution, but it was demonstrated that Catholics in the charismatic movement, and listen, while this was happening, here's a prophet screaming out, "Don't do it. Come out of her. Come out of her, my people. Come out of her. Don't be a part of her pledge. Don't be a part of her sins. Come out. Come out. &gt;&gt; They're saying, uh, he preached serpent seed. Tell little stories or whatever more he preaches. He doesn't believe in the trinity and taint and slander, a spotless ministry. In the meantime, going back to the great who has the blood of millions under her skirts, &gt;&gt; you ought to stand up and say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; That God should ever come and give us this kind of understanding. &gt;&gt; And he says that Catholics in the charismatic movement received, here's what they received. Mr. duplic received a glow and a complete purging of the importance of doctrine. Didn't care what they taught. Mary, Trinity, purgatory, the whole bit. &gt;&gt; All the superstitions and stuff and nonsense and all the goofy hats and all the robes and everything else without the audacity to say this is utter nonsense. &gt;&gt; Why don't you men just put on some clothes and stop looking like a bunch of women? You know what? Even amongst believers today, they kind of shun and shy away. Brother brother Reagan told me when he bring up these subjects, he said, you know, it falls a little bit quiet. Don't you dare fall quiet. Don't you dare leave me with just with my neck on the line. I want you to join me. Don't say, "Who's on the Lord's side? Come with me." Hallelujah. And he says that those that came in the charismatic movement received a greater appreciation for the mass marry and the sacraments. That's what the charismatic movement did for them and more support was received by the hierarchy. Charismatic meetings exist in almost every country. There are numerous charismatic bishops including one Cardinal Leo Suninins of Belgium. John Paul 2, this one that you just saw laying on the on the board commissioned Cardinal Sunnins to guide the evolution of the Catholic Charismatic renewal so that this was his commission so that it enters fully into the heart of the church. Right. &gt;&gt; Pentecost sold themselves out. &gt;&gt; It's the two three popes ago sold themselves out, invited the man, gave him the kind of a, you know, respect and whatever more and swept it in. Of course, they had to do it. &gt;&gt; It had to be that way. Oh, thank God. I got out just in time. Hallelujah. I got out just in time. Just in time. Oh my goodness. I feel like having a jubilee. I feel like having rejoicing. [Music] Hallelujah. I'm done. Just a few moments. I got I'm going to be finished. They had an ecumenical charismatic renewal conference in Kansas City and a bunch of names but Lutheran Baptist Episcopalian Catholic Methodist Orthodox Jesus for Jews Pentecostal Holiness Dr. David Duply, Cardinal Leo Sumins, Ruth Carter Stapleton, which is President Carter, his sister, and quite a number of others. Those are the dignitaries which were present. I'm not saying it was at this conference that this next quote came from, but this is from this is from a an article at the Pentecostal movement in the Catholic Church. And this is one of their leaders and theologians now speaking and I quote and I want you to listen over here. This been the purpose of one of the purpose of this meeting. Over here the last church age Pentecostal swallowed up into Rome and testified his major points that doctrine was not important. Amen. I was completely purged of the importance of doctrine. Now one of their people who has received what he said he has, this is the effect on him. Rebaptism, quote, rebaptism is unacceptable because of baptism, one is reborn and made a member of the church. So they're establishing it very very firmly. Rebaptism is unacceptable. &gt;&gt; Rebaptism, rebaptism is anathema. &gt;&gt; That's a curse. &gt;&gt; Too bad he doesn't say, "You know what? I come into this charismatic thing and I was just purged of all my doctrine." No, he got anointed &gt;&gt; to reestablish his doctrine &gt;&gt; and to tell all of these ignorant people of the Pentecostal age that they got swallowed up. We'll tell you what what is doctrine and what is not. &gt;&gt; Here I'm still continuing. It's anathema an anathema for a Catholic to undergo believers baptism is heretical or the very least a scandal. No one can receive the knowledge that he is saved. &gt;&gt; Hello. You just had one of their theologians call you a liar &gt;&gt; cuz you say, "I know I'm saved." &gt;&gt; I know I'm saved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, Satan is a liar and the father of all lies. &gt;&gt; And he's got a lot of children and priests and whatever more and preachers that are saying the same thing. He said, "No one can have the certitude about his ultimate salvation. This is unscriptural and in contradiction with a firm and unanimous Catholic tradition and with the formal teachings of the Council of Trent." Now, that's where he went back to the formal Catholic teachings and the Council of Trent. And that's why you can't know that you're saved because those guys back there said so. &gt;&gt; He that believeth on the son hath life. And he that believeth not on the son hath not life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not die but have eternal life. Isn't that the scripture? Beloved, now are we the sons of God, &gt;&gt; and it does not appear what we shall be, but when he shall appear, we shall be like him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; This man's name was Killian McConnell, quite a first name. He concludes, "Catholic Pentecostals tend to go back and cultivate all the avenues to God that they had abandoned, they had abandoned, but the charismatic movement moves them back to embrace all of them again. and he itemizes them all that they had abandoned, the rosary, visits to the blessed sacrament, devotion to Mary, and frequent confession, daily mass and communion. And at Notre Dame, Cardinal Leo Suninins, who is appointed by this pope, the one who just passed away to bring this charismatic movement to the very heart of the church. He concludes by saying, "The secret of our unity with the Holy Spirit is our unity with Mary, the mother of God." And at these words, the entire 25,000 rose to their feet for a long period of applause and praise. We ought to be ashamed that when you realize that you're loose, you can't stand with a loud applause of gratitude and praise. &gt;&gt; There they are saying, "This charismatic movement has brought us back. to all of these things. And God would send us undeserving humans, &gt;&gt; a prophet that batted his way across the country &gt;&gt; to somehow speak a message on a tape or some other means and get a book into your hands that gave you the kind of deliverance that you have today. I tell you what, young people and old alike, you ought to give him all of your life. You ought to give him everything you have. We have every reason to thank him. Glory to God. Thank God. Thank God. Hallelujah. [Music] Oh, how we thank you, Lord. How we give you praise. So grateful for not caught in that place. Thank you, Lord. Oh, bless his name. Bless his name. Bless his name. Once like a bird in prison, I dwelt. No freedom from my sorrows I felt but he set us free. &gt;&gt; We were held and bound also by traditions. Think about where you were. &gt;&gt; Think about where you were. &gt;&gt; Think about what you were into. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think about where you were. &gt;&gt; Think about where you would be today. &gt;&gt; And I just tell you friends, I haven't got time to even go on and finish. I'm a long ways from finishing. But there's a squeeze coming on. There's a squeeze that's gonna The first thing they did, they identified the troublesome group. &gt;&gt; These people are troubled because they're blasting out on a without any shame or restriction. And we have to silence them. And you know, in this day and age, you know, it's it's diplomacy. They'll work in the background. They'll work in the back rooms and and they'll make they'll they'll make it impossible. First they identify the group. That's what they did before the Second World War. Identified the Jews are the problem. Then they, you know, however they identify, that's up to them. They made them wear a star. Well, I'd be happy to wear a star. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd I'd wear the five star, six point star, or whatever it is of I'd be happy to wear that. &gt;&gt; Oh, there is one of those guys. You go in the mall, you girls. Hello. &gt;&gt; And if you cringe now, I tell you, you won't even be in it then. That's right. &gt;&gt; If you cringe now, &gt;&gt; if you cringe now, if you find something now that God touches your heart, say, "Well, you know, little too straight, a little too straight. I'll just wait for another time." No. When the other time comes, you you'll you'll surrender up your beliefs. &gt;&gt; You'll surrender them up. and identified them and they told them, "You can't shop where we shop. &gt;&gt; You can't ride on the same bus as we ride. Fact is, you can't be in business anymore because we don't renew your license. You're a contractor. You got a license. You got a sound studio. You're a musician. You want to have a license. You sell automobiles. You're a machinist, financial planner. Sorry. This is a church. Not anymore. We just we take we we're going to descertify it. &gt;&gt; But if you'd like to come in line &gt;&gt; with with all the regulations, fine. No problem. We understand. Just surrender them up. And they tightened it up. You say, "Well, could it get that tight?" That's just the beginning. &gt;&gt; That's just the beginning. &gt;&gt; And one benefit and another benefit and they go and they're taken away. And then the who knows after that, then persecution, whatever kind of persecution, then the media gets a hold of it. They identified you. They identify you as you brothers and sisters have been in a colony. You don't know anything about being identified like this. You could have all the black hats and all the beards you want. This will be a whole lot more. Say, "Oh, you're the believers that you you believe that false cult. You got a dead prophet. Now we really know who you are." &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I have a prophet, but he's not dead." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; None of them are dead. &gt;&gt; But I'm prepared &gt;&gt; whatever happens. And you say, "Well, do you really think?" I really think that those things those things still lay in the message. &gt;&gt; And they say, "There will be a squeeze." A lot of people waiting for what kind of a squeeze, but there'll be a squeeze. &gt;&gt; But I don't want to conclude just on a high note. But I will tell you that the bride of Jesus Christ, you have to decide where you are will not be in a tribulation. &gt;&gt; And with sorrow in my heart, unless God does some remarkable things for some folks here in this church, you will be in it. and you'll then prove what you really believed. &gt;&gt; And you think that you don't have support. Now, this is I got news for you. This is this is the most support you're ever going to get &gt;&gt; right here and now. &gt;&gt; The word is here. &gt;&gt; The ministry is here. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters are here. The Holy Ghost is here. All these things are here. This is the greatest you're ever going to have. &gt;&gt; If you can't make it now, you won't make it then. Believe me, you won't make it then. And I felt in my heart I needed to say that today. &gt;&gt; And I want you to be able to say within the very depths of your soul, &gt;&gt; Lord God, brother Ed, and whoever will hear me, I am resolved &gt;&gt; to enter the kingdom &gt;&gt; and nothing shall stand in my way. &gt;&gt; You young fell still got education. Is education going to stand your way? Tell me, sports going to stand your way? &gt;&gt; No, sir not. &gt;&gt; Is music going to stand your way? &gt;&gt; Some talent or gift going to stand your way? Is money going to stand your way? Businessman, &gt;&gt; tell me. &gt;&gt; Is job or support from my family is going to stand your way? Are you prepared to give it all up if I need to? But I will not deny my Christ the word of God. I had a little family. I had a job and I was preaching and didn't have anything. I had a house to live in thanks to my father-in-law. And I came home from having meetings all through the states. I came home broke and I needed work. and two men, Lutheran men, hired me. And my father spent his inheritance, which wasn't a lot of money, but it was quite a bit of money for those days. He spent his inheritance that he received from his father, my grandfather, when he passed away. He spent his entire inheritance republishing and reprinting tracks of converted nuns and priests and what they'd come into in salvation. And he spent the entire inheritance and distributed to every home by hand in a city of maybe 8 10,000 and another one where my brother-in-law, brother Brenda and Anne were living and he and he got some other helpers and they delivered to every place. I didn't I was not in support of it. I was not against it. I I I just didn't know the burden that I thought maybe there's a better way. Catholic priest of the city of Dawson Creek came to my employers, Alan Dalan and Oliver Swenson, well known to my sister and her husband, senior lovely men. And we were standing at a at the desk in the store and they said, "Ed, we were visited by the Catholic priest last night and they have told us he said there are 2,000 Catholic residents in this city and that our store will not be what do you call will &gt;&gt; support &gt;&gt; supported. Our store will not be shopped in until you are until you have you're rid of Edisll. He said, "And we told them that it is not you. It is your father." And the priest said, "It makes no difference. we will not none no Catholic will shop in your store till he's gone. And I said, "Listen, no issue, no problem. I won't put you to that." They said, "Well, listen. What we'd like you to do, you put an ad in the paper and and you know, uh, state that you h you are not associated with this. You have nothing to do with this and we will pay for the ad. and they thought that might suffice them. I said, "No, although I perhaps don't really support the way my father's doing it, I I do support what he believes and I I cannot do that." But I said, "I do. You have no problem. I won't I won't put you in that difficult place. I will leave. I will just leave." this man, a trustee of a Lutheran church. I'm talking about about 1959. He just went like this. I can't stand those people telling me what to do. And I smiled and I said, "But they are, aren't they, Oliver? &gt;&gt; They're telling you what to do." 1958 when a whole lot of you folks weren't born. I know a little bit about what I'm talking about. And the prophet said this. He said, "Although they never envisioned all these Protestants never envisioned it to be this way that they that the Catholic Church will take over, will unite with Protestantism and will take over." He said they never envisioned it that way. But that's what's going to happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, in Canada, this is largely a Catholic nation. We have a large population, and I want to say this in closing in case anyone ever hears this outside of this church. It's not the people, it's the system. Brother Brandham says, and you remember Sister Bobby was the words I said to our sister Bobby Graham just outside. It's not the people, it's the system that corrupts them. &gt;&gt; Said they go in there to be good people. They go in to be good nuns and go in to be good priests, but the system corrupts them. I had another message. We have another system. We have another system and it doesn't corrupt but it redoss. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It gives life. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to sing because it been on my heart all day. Search me, oh God, and know my thoughts today. And then we're going to close. Thank you for your patience. And our brother Anoir will be ministering tonight. We give him full support and time. Have a rest. Get refreshed and come back. All right. Search me, oh God, and know my heart today. Christ me, oh Savior, all my pray see there be some wicked way in [Music] Every sing. &gt;&gt; I would like to sing just a third verse, please. Lord, take my life. Lord, take my life. Grant it Lord and make me holy thine. [Music] Fill my pure heart with thy great love divine. Take all my will, my passion, self and pride. [Applause] I now surrender Lord in me. [Music] Let us just reverently pray. I'm going to ask brother Dier if you would come. Please, brother Dier. And I would ask you today, you know where you are. You know where you stand. We don't want some emotional thing, but I would sincerely desire if God spoke to you on in a specific way that you just surrender your entire will to him and let there be a concrete change. Let it be between you and God. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Brother Dier, [Music] our gracious father, we're truly thankful this morning, oh God, to know the things that we know and to have hearts to believe, Father, when we consider the multitude, Father, that are walking in darkness and in spiritual for prisons. Oh God, truly our hearts rejoice this morning to know what we have heard this day, Father, and for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to cause us to know the hour that we're living in, the seriousness, Father, of these things. Learn the solemnity of this presence that is here, of the word that has gone forth and hearts that are waited in the balance and found wanting. Lord, I pray, oh God, that you'll not let anyone escape the pool of the spirit. And would you minister an entrance, oh God, to those that are needy this morning? For the word has not been sent in vain, but truly to give us warning. How much time of warning we're entitled to, we just don't know. Father, but how we desire to maximize the opportunity to capitalize upon it today and not let these things escape our grip, but get a hold of them, Father, and believe, oh God, unto the salvation of souls for those that are in need this morning, Father. We feel the burden of the word of the Lord. And we ask, oh God, that you'll just move in an unusual way. That you'll confirm your presence, Father. that you confirm your word with signs following dear God. That those that need to escape from the grip of the enemy will find a deliverance today in the house of God. For the word has been proclaimed a trumpet of deliverance and jubilee, oh God, to set us free from any influence that'll bond us, oh God, and keep us from this free salvation that you made available to us this morning. Lord, we pray that those that have need will go receiving today and your servant who has been obedient to the voice of God. Would you renew him and strengthen him, Father? Would you just continue to unveil your word to him that he may feed the flock of God, you know how much we need to hear those things in this hour. Lord, we thank you for your grace today. We ask that you'll dismiss us with your presence and bring us back again for more of your work. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're dismissed in Jesus name. Greet one another. We'll see you at 5:00. Come early. Good seat. God bless you. Bless you, brother. [Music] Do you know? [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
