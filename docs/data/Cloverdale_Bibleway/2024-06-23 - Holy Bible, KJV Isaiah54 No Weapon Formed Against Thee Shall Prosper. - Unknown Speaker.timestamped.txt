[0:00] the book of the prophet Isaiah chapter
[0:03] 54 sing Oh Baron thou that D not bear
[0:08] Break Forth into singing and cry aloud
[0:11] thou that D not travail with child for
[0:13] more are the children of the desolate
[0:15] than the children of the married wife
[0:17] saith the Lord enlarge the place of thy
[0:20] tent and let them stretch forth the
[0:22] curtains of thine habitations spare not
[0:25] lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy
[0:27] Stakes for Thou shalt Break Forth on the
[0:30] right hand and on the left and thy seed
[0:32] shall inherit the Gentiles and make the
[0:35] desolate cities to be inhabited fear not
[0:38] for Thou shalt not be ashamed neither be
[0:40] thou confounded for Thou shalt not be
[0:43] put to shame for Thou shalt forget the
[0:45] shame of thy Youth and shalt not
[0:47] remember the reproach of thy widowhood
[0:49] anymore for thy maker is thine husband
[0:52] the Lord of hosts is his name and thy
[0:55] Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god
[0:57] of the whole Earth shall he be called
[0:59] for for the Lord hath called thee as a
[1:01] woman Forsaken and grieved in spirit and
[1:03] a wife of Youth when thou was refused
[1:07] saith thy God for a small moment have I
[1:09] forsaken thee but with great mercies
[1:12] will I gather thee in a little wrath I
[1:14] hid my face from thee for a moment but
[1:17] with Everlasting kindness will I have
[1:19] mercy on thee saith the Lord thy
[1:21] Redeemer for this is as the Waters of
[1:24] Noah unto me for as I have sworn that
[1:26] the Waters of Noah should no more go
[1:28] over the Earth so have I sworn that I
[1:30] would not be wroth with thee nor rebuke
[1:33] thee for the mountains shall depart and
[1:35] the hills be removed but my kindness
[1:38] shall not depart from thee neither shall
[1:40] the Covenant of my peace be removed
[1:42] saith the Lord that hath Mercy on thee
[1:45] Oh thou Afflicted tossed with Tempest
[1:48] and not comforted behold I will lay thy
[1:51] stones with Fair colors and lay thy
[1:53] foundations with Sapphires and I will
[1:56] make thy Windows of agots and thy Gates
[1:58] of carbunkle and all thy borders of
[2:01] pleasant stones and all thy children
[2:03] shall be taught of the Lord and great
[2:05] shall be the Peace of thy children in
[2:08] righteousness shalt thou be established
[2:10] Thou shalt be far from oppression for
[2:13] Thou shalt not fear and from Terror for
[2:16] it shall not come near thee behold they
[2:18] shall surely gather together but not by
[2:21] me whosoever Shall Gather together
[2:23] against thee shall fall for thy sake
[2:26] behold I have created the Smith that
[2:28] bloweth the coals in the fire and that
[2:30] bringeth forth an instrument for his
[2:32] work and I have created the waster to
[2:35] destroy no weapon that is formed against
[2:37] thee shall prosper and every tongue that
[2:40] shall rise against thee in judgment Thou
[2:42] shalt condemn this is the heritage of
[2:44] the Servants of the Lord and their
[2:46] righteousness is of me saeth the Lord
