[1:38] this morning, saints.
[1:41] Amen. And I trust everyone has come here

[1:51] It's what God wants this morning. Amen.
[1:53] And he wants us to come this morning
[1:55] with a broken and contrite heart. The
[1:57] Lord said he would never despise that.
[2:00] Let's uh turn on the screen this morning
[2:02] number 522.
[2:05] We want Jesus to come this morning. Then
[2:08] Jesus came.
[2:10] One sat alone beside a highway begging.
[2:14] Amen. But then Jesus came and made his
[2:18] darkness flee. Amen. Let's sing it
[2:20] together. One sat alone
[2:25] beside the highway.
[2:31] His eyes were blind.
[2:35] The light he could not see.
[2:41] He clutched his rags
[2:45] and shivered in the shadow.
[2:51] Then Jesus came
[2:54] and made his darkness.

[3:38] from home and friends,
[3:42] the evil spirit broke him
[3:47] among the tombs.
[3:51] He dwelt in vis.
[3:57] He cut himself
[4:00] as demon powers possess
[4:04] him.
[4:05] Then Jesus came
[4:09] and set the captive free.
[4:15] When Jesus comes the table
[4:21] is broken.
[4:23] [Music]
[4:27] The tears I

[15:25] Thank you, Father.
[15:29] Man, it's good to have a brother Kim
[15:30] Dingwall here this morning. Brother Kim,
[15:32] I'm going to ask you if you'd come and
[15:33] open the service in a word of prayer. Uh
[15:36] there's a testimony here this morning
[15:37] from a brother Frank Fletcher. Says, "I
[15:40] want to thank all my dear brothers and
[15:42] sisters for the many prayers regarding
[15:44] the things that were ailing me. The Lord
[15:47] Jesus has helped me of gastroenteritis,
[15:50] Paul of shingles. Glory to his holy
[15:52] name." and uh he just wants to thank
[15:55] everyone and also for his thumb which is
[15:58] much better.
[16:00] Uh Sister Diana Johnson says, "I want to
[16:02] give the Lord glory. Last week when
[16:04] Sister Bondie went to the front for
[16:05] prayer, I also was in need for healing
[16:07] and the pain left. The Lord answers
[16:10] prayers."
[16:12] Brother Tom Frey uh is a woman that uh
[16:16] works with him has asked for prayer for
[16:18] her husband who has a slow growing
[16:21] cancer. Her words were that she believes
[16:22] in the power of prayer. Also, uh,
[16:25] brother Tom is thanking everyone for
[16:27] praying for, uh, sister Kim's family.
[16:30] Her nephew passed away on Friday morning
[16:32] and, uh, thankfully they were able to
[16:34] see him on Wednesday. We're encouraged
[16:37] that God has a plan for her family and
[16:39] they just want to u ask for continued
[16:42] prayer for the family. Also, our brother
[16:45] Isaac Nash is requesting prayer for a
[16:47] friend of his who's not a Christian. and
[16:50] his dad is in the hospital in very
[16:52] serious condition has requested that we
[16:55] pray for him. And also uh I'm requesting
[16:58] prayer this morning. There's a fellow
[16:59] who lives down in Orlando, Florida that
[17:02] uh I've done some work with and we just
[17:05] found out he's been diagnosed with
[17:06] cancer both in the brain and the liver.
[17:08] Very serious. And uh if God doesn't
[17:11] touch him, he's in big trouble and he
[17:13] doesn't uh know the Lord. So I just ask
[17:16] that you'd pray for him this morning as
[17:17] well. Amen. And how many have a need
[17:20] this morning, Brother Kim, as you come,
[17:22] you just lift before the Lord in prayer.
[17:24] And if uh if you're listening in on the
[17:27] internet this morning and you've got a
[17:29] need this morning, you just raise it
[17:30] before him as we go to prayer. Amen.
[17:40] Father, we just bow in your presence
[17:41] this morning.
[17:47] Father, we're just so thankful for your
[17:49] August presence this morning, Lord.
[17:56] Lord, you know I have a desire this this
[17:58] morning to stand in your presence and
[18:00] worship you, Lord.
[18:04] Father, we come into your presence,
[18:06] Lord, after having rubbed our shoulders
[18:08] with the world. And Father, like Aaron's
[18:12] rod, Lord, we just bud and blossom in
[18:15] your presence, Lord. We feel so alive in
[18:18] your presence, oh God.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; Father, we hear the testimonies of how
[18:23] you've moved among us and healed the
[18:26] sick and delivered the afflicted, Lord.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[18:31] &gt;&gt; Father, that's what we expect in your
[18:33] presence, Lord.
[18:35] And this morning, we just come this
[18:37] morning as we opened in song this
[18:39] morning. We're here to worship you this
[18:42] morning, Lord. Here I am to bow down
[18:45] before you, oh God. To prostate
[18:48] ourselves before the living God this
[18:50] morning, Lord. We love you this morning,
[18:53] Lord. We lift our voices in adoration of
[18:57] you this morning, oh God.
[19:00] But Father, we just ask that you'd make
[19:03] yourself known this morning. We can't
[19:05] even ask that you'd come this morning,
[19:07] Father, for we know you're here already,
[19:09] Lord.
[19:10] Father, we just pray that you'd move up
[19:12] and down and stop at every seat, Lord.
[19:16] Father, may each person here be
[19:18] conscious of your presence this morning,
[19:20] Lord. Father, for in your presence, we
[19:23] find all that we have need of, Lord.
[19:26] Father, it's just so wonderful to stand
[19:28] here this morning with the saints of God
[19:31] and worship you, Lord.
[19:34] Lord, when I was thinking this morning
[19:35] of that song, When Jesus came, there's
[19:38] several hundred testimonies this morning
[19:41] here of when Jesus came. Our lives were
[19:44] changed, Lord. We were set free, Lord,
[19:47] to worship you, God.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; We love you this morning, Lord.
[19:52] [Music]
[19:54] &gt;&gt; And Lord, there's needs among us this
[19:56] morning. Father, may you just raise our
[19:59] consciousness of your presence, Lord,
[20:01] because we know that in your presence we
[20:04] find all we have need of, Lord.
[20:07] And then we ask this morning as the word
[20:09] would come forth, Lord. That you just
[20:11] minister to our hearts personally, Lord.
[20:15] We love you this morning. Have your way,
[20:18] Lord. Bless us as we continue to worship
[20:20] you in your name. Hallelujah.
[20:24] Thank you, Jesus.
[20:26] [Music]
[20:28] Amen. You may be seated.
[20:36] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[20:42] [Music]
[20:45] We want to welcome all those who are
[20:47] visiting with us this morning and uh we
[20:49] just are happy to have each and every
[20:50] one of you. Um
[20:53] I got a note here from brother Gary St.
[20:55] John that a brother Andrew from Alaska
[20:58] may be in the service visiting today and
[21:00] left a message that he was coming today.
[21:02] Uh are you here with us, brother Andrew?
[21:05] Don't know if he is or not. If he is, we
[21:07] get you to stand up. Is he here?
[21:12] A long ways from Alaska, so maybe he
[21:13] didn't make it. Anyways,
[21:16] we are happy to have everybody here
[21:18] who's visiting with us.
[21:21] Um,
[21:25] we've got some sisters are going to sing
[21:26] a song for us this morning and uh
[21:30] the name of the song I pronounce it
[21:32] wrong is a Hakuna Wakita

[21:40] language they speak in Zimbabwe and the
[21:43] second part is uh is in a language

[21:59] "These are troubled times, my friends."
[22:03] Amen. Have you seen lots of trouble in
[22:04] the world? Amen. But God is in his
[22:07] people once again. Aren't you thankful?
[22:10] These are troubled times,

[29:27] We prayed on Wednesday night for the
[29:30] family of Sister Kim Frey's uh sister
[29:35] whose son was uh seriously injured in a
[29:38] motorcycle accident. And that son passed
[29:41] away on Friday morning about uh 7 in the
[29:45] morning, I understand. And so we'd like
[29:48] the congregation if they'd remember
[29:51] especially uh we're not just wanting to
[29:53] remember the family. What we're really
[29:55] wanting to do is pray that God will use
[30:00] uh this accident and this tragedy to
[30:03] make spiritual inroads.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Do you agree?
[30:08] Everything should have a spiritual
[30:09] impact and to and to allow now the
[30:12] testimony of brother Tom and sister Kim
[30:16] to allow their testimony and their
[30:18] family to make serious inroads into
[30:22] those that have perhaps who knows of the
[30:25] family that have pondered about things
[30:26] of life and perhaps they have wondered
[30:29] about things without ever expressing it.
[30:32] But now we pray that this crisis will
[30:35] cause their hearts to be opened and made
[30:37] tender and may the testimony of this
[30:40] word reach into into their hearts.
[30:43] That's what we desire. So we pray for
[30:46] that and we'll be praying for you,
[30:49] brother Tom Citric. God bless you.
[30:53] At the end of today's service, we're
[30:56] asking that the deacons will have I have
[30:59] a a little survey here. We want we want
[31:03] every person
[31:05] every person 18 and older. The reason we
[31:09] put that is because for most 18 year
[31:11] olds at least are driving. But this is
[31:15] every person in the church that's 18 and
[31:18] over to fill out this survey. We've not
[31:22] had Sunday morning uh Sunday evening
[31:25] services throughout the summer. And uh
[31:29] we had I had good reason to do so. And I
[31:32] gave about 15 10 or 12 or maybe up to 15
[31:38] uh reasons describing the uniqueness of
[31:40] this church. And so now we are wanting
[31:44] you to fill out this survey which simply
[31:46] says it's very simple. Nobody should
[31:48] make any mistakes. I live in the USA.
[31:51] Either tick that. I live in Canada. I'm
[31:55] a married adult with children.
[31:58] or I'm a married adult with no children.
[32:02] I'm a single adult over 18 years old or
[32:05] I'm a single parent and I'm in favor of
[32:08] one service on Sunday or I'm in favor of
[32:11] two services on Sunday and that's it.
[32:13] You don't have to sign it, but we do
[32:16] want everyone to make one out
[32:19] in uh
[32:21] in this uh yesterday's paper which
[32:25] delivered to my door. Uh the front the
[32:29] front lines is showing the
[32:32] traffic at the Blaine border and I had
[32:37] noticed it but I didn't know exactly
[32:39] why. I had never heard of my 30 6 37
[32:44] years of living here, we've never
[32:46] experienced hour and a half, two hours,
[32:49] and two and a half hour lineups at the
[32:52] border. But they had announced here that
[32:55] last Thursday
[32:57] the Department of Homeland Security has
[33:00] announced to add a whole array of
[33:05] security and high-tech surveillance
[33:07] equipment and literally turn the entire
[33:11] border between Canada and the United
[33:14] States into what they will call a
[33:15] virtual border
[33:18] uh high-tech. It won't be a a wall as
[33:21] such but it will be a techn high-tech
[33:24] wall and they're going to do it through
[33:27] a whole series of equipment and I
[33:30] suppose maybe during this process maybe
[33:32] that is why we've been experiencing what
[33:35] we've been experiencing.
[33:37] Uh I want to tell you friends that this
[33:40] business of a Sunday morning service,
[33:42] Sunday evening service is something that
[33:45] I have agonized over. This isn't some
[33:47] light thing. And if anyone has in their
[33:50] mind that we're just relaxing and
[33:53] wanting to have more fellowship Sunday
[33:55] evening, just get that out of your head
[33:57] because that doesn't exist. This
[33:59] something I've agonized over for a long
[34:02] time. And even to the point of looking
[34:05] for halls on the US side, thought of
[34:08] having a morning service here, evening
[34:10] service there. I had feedback from the
[34:13] people said it won't work. Uh, I'm going
[34:16] to be in both services anyway. Uh,
[34:18] someone on the US side who's sitting
[34:20] here today said, uh, uh, you can't do
[34:23] that. That's my family and I'm part of
[34:26] the family up there and I I I want to be
[34:29] with the with the people at the church
[34:32] and even if you have a service down
[34:33] there, I I'm going to be here anyway.
[34:35] So, we just had an enormous amount of
[34:38] feedback. Now, those that have no
[34:41] children
[34:43] and you live close to the church here,
[34:46] I'm just going to ask that when you when
[34:49] you fill this out, I want you to be
[34:51] honest. I want you to be sincere, and I
[34:53] don't want you to be selfish. It's not
[34:55] exactly what you would want, but it's
[34:58] what's best for the for the
[35:00] congregation. And if someone has some
[35:03] real bright uh quick
[35:07] solution, I'd certainly be happy to hear
[35:10] it. It's a difficult This congregation
[35:13] is is very unique for a number of
[35:16] reasons. Number one, we're believers of
[35:18] the message. And because of that, people
[35:22] come from long distances to be in the
[35:26] congregation and to be together. and why
[35:28] you have made this your church home. I
[35:31] do not have your answer. You have that
[35:34] within your own heart. And now what we
[35:37] want to do is make the church and make
[35:40] the congregation and make the meetings
[35:43] um uh so that they're not that they
[35:46] don't um uh uh weary the people to such
[35:51] a degree. I know that people want to
[35:52] come. They want to come from, you know,
[35:55] many of the people come from maybe not
[35:59] so great a distance, but here's just
[36:01] what, you know, a brother expressed to
[36:03] me and two brothers in fact, one is on a
[36:06] Canadian side. These are real sincere
[36:09] brothers. Both have families. And uh
[36:13] they said, "Well, because the church is
[36:15] crowded, we want to be there early. We'd
[36:17] like to be there at least by 10:00." And
[36:20] one brother on the US side with the
[36:22] family said, "I leave uh maybe leave
[36:25] maybe 8:00 so I can have my children
[36:28] here and be here by 9 or 9:30. Have lots
[36:33] of time, maybe be an hour ahead of the
[36:35] service." And then then we just have
[36:38] enter into the meeting and we have such
[36:39] a beautiful time and the atmosphere so
[36:44] lovely and we leave here. we can't go
[36:46] home, but we go to a restaurant where I
[36:50] feed the have to feed my family. And he
[36:53] says, "The music and the atmosphere just
[36:57] absolutely drains me. It's just like I
[36:59] lose everything that I had in the
[37:01] service. And then uh you know $50 later
[37:06] after paying for your food, then we've
[37:08] got a couple of hours to kind of float
[37:11] around, wait around maybe in the churchy
[37:13] yard or parking lot till the evening
[37:14] service starts at 5:00 and then when
[37:18] it's over, then we're getting home uh 12
[37:21] 13 hours since we left. Well, you can do
[37:25] that for a while. Now, when they're a
[37:27] young couple and have no children,
[37:30] that's very easy to do. when they start
[37:32] getting you've got children, you've got
[37:34] teenagers or you got small children. You
[37:36] can't keep them cooped up in the car,
[37:38] cooped up in a restaurant, cooped up in
[37:40] the church and so on. They've got to
[37:42] expend some of their energy. So, I have
[37:45] been wrestling with these things and we
[37:48] want to do exactly what's best. But the
[37:50] majority, if the majority of the
[37:52] congregation said, "No, we're ready for
[37:54] the sacrifice. We're just going to be
[37:56] there and go the whole distance." then I
[37:59] would expect that you'll be here Sunday
[38:01] evening uh and don't miss the Sunday
[38:03] evening services because it's also not
[38:06] fair for a man of God to wait on God to
[38:09] spend his time in prayer and to and and
[38:12] to come to a church where 10 or 15% of
[38:15] the people aren't here.
[38:18] You hear me? You hear me? So now this
[38:20] thing goes both ways. It's not just what
[38:23] you want. It's also what the ministry
[38:25] feels is is the best for the for the
[38:28] congregation. And I I don't I don't like
[38:31] to see people missing the evening
[38:34] service uh because of their distance and
[38:36] and so on. And I took a I took a little
[38:39] bit of a survey just myself and there is
[38:44] approximately
[38:46] uh 250 248 to be exact close to my count
[38:52] that are living on the US side. That's a
[38:55] sizable congregation. 250 people about
[38:59] 60 of those are children. The rest are
[39:02] adults. and uh and out in Chilowak which
[39:05] is a good distance away uh we have about
[39:09] 33.
[39:10] So we're coming close to 300 of of the
[39:14] people that are represented here live
[39:16] quite some distance away and I excluded
[39:20] all the people in Seattle or Lynwood or
[39:24] Tacoma. We've excluded all of those
[39:27] which those names are on our on our
[39:30] phone list but I have excluded those
[39:32] because I wanted this to be as accurate
[39:34] as possible. Having said that, I don't
[39:37] want you to be troubled about it uh
[39:40] while we have the service this morning
[39:42] because I've got more important things
[39:43] to say. And uh but if you will make sure
[39:46] I want everyone to take a survey, just
[39:49] fill that out, please. You can uh just
[39:52] leave it on the offering box or put it
[39:54] in the offering box or or hand it uh
[39:57] into the office if you would please. Now
[40:02] uh I have a short clip. The church the
[40:06] church here got uh really behind
[40:10] uh brother uh Cesar's work in uh in uh
[40:15] Brazil. And we have had we've got now a
[40:20] oh we've probably got six eight or 10
[40:23] DVDs of the television broadcast which
[40:26] he has uh is putting across the nation
[40:30] and uh and God opened the door. You
[40:34] remember here some weeks ago now uh
[40:37] actually just 3 four months ago God
[40:39] opened the door. He had a he was on a
[40:42] local television station and was having
[40:44] very good response. He'd been on it
[40:46] quite a some time. I don't know how
[40:48] long. Then he determined that uh this
[40:51] door opened for him to go across the
[40:54] whole nation. And uh he just it was
[40:58] going to cost a considerable amount of
[41:01] money and going to cost about $48,000
[41:05] for the year. And uh but the CEO, the
[41:09] president of the national station just
[41:12] happened to run into him at the station
[41:14] has his local station in his city and
[41:16] he's in a large city also and said that
[41:19] he would allow him to cover the entire
[41:21] nation of Brazil which is I think fifth
[41:24] largest on earth uh for half price. And
[41:29] so they simply I I I simply made it
[41:32] known to the people here. We never took
[41:34] up an offering or anything. But by 5:00
[41:37] that afternoon from the morning service
[41:39] before the evening service started, that
[41:41] year was paid for.
[41:43] And so I just people just came to me and
[41:47] said, I have a burden for that. I want
[41:50] to do that. I respected that. So we let
[41:52] them know. So this just a little clip of
[41:56] what you will see. I want you to see it
[41:58] now. It's just a few minutes long. And
[42:00] this is uh brother Cesar in Brazil.
[42:21] SP.

[46:58] [Music]
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:11] Hallelujah.
[47:18] I tell you what, I rejoice
[47:20] &gt;&gt; think that's going over and uh literally
[47:24] hundreds of thousands of people. Here's
[47:27] Can I just take a couple of moments?
[47:29] This is why you know uh we're having
[47:32] service this evening, Lord's table,
[47:35] footwashing tonight, so at 5:00 sharp,
[47:38] but I'm going to take my time this
[47:40] morning anyway.
[47:42] Uh here's just a few of the testimonies
[47:44] from this broadcast. Uh this just just
[47:48] little clips of it. As a majority of
[47:50] Christian people in Brazil, the
[47:53] teachings I had concerning the trinity
[47:56] which have its deep roots on the
[47:58] Catholic doctrine. For the first time, I
[48:01] heard through FA perfea,
[48:06] whatever it is, broadcast something that
[48:08] brought me to the truth of such
[48:11] doctrine. Another one, in truth, I don't
[48:15] know what my life would now be without
[48:18] this broadcast. For I was in a tunnel
[48:21] with no exits. I found out through your
[48:25] Christ centered teachings I was in fact
[48:28] a fake. The truth of your broadcast
[48:31] helped show me how to live an authentic
[48:34] Christian life in in never realized the
[48:38] great deception about the true doctrine
[48:40] of the godhead. I also thank you for the
[48:43] DVD you sent me and if possible please
[48:46] send me the epos exposition of the seven
[48:49] church ages and on and on. I don't want
[48:51] to take I've got a whole page of them
[48:53] here and uh that was just one part that
[48:56] had been sent to us. Uh, I I rejoice
[48:58] because this is what has to happen until
[49:01] until we go home and we're going to be
[49:04] speaking about that. So, I trust you're
[49:06] alert. I trust you're anxious to hear
[49:10] the word this morning. And we'll have
[49:12] you stand to your feet.
[49:14] Turn, if you would, to the small book of
[49:17] Habac,
[49:18] which is just before Zechariah in the
[49:21] Old Testament. We're going to read some
[49:24] verses from chapter 2, verses 1, 2, and
[49:28] 3.
[49:32] While you find your place,
[49:38] we're going to just bow our heads in
[49:41] prayer and ask that our Lord will be
[49:45] glorified
[49:46] and pleased with the events of today.
[49:50] Father,
[49:52] even as we have been pondering coming to
[49:55] the Lord's table tonight, what a
[49:57] gracious time that is for every
[50:00] believer.
[50:02] And Lord, we pray that your people
[50:06] uh which have come today, this morning
[50:09] to receive from you, they will not go
[50:12] away disappointed.
[50:14] They will receive what is needful for
[50:17] them for their walk. I pray that you
[50:20] will just plant deep within our very
[50:24] being. Oh God, as we as we study these
[50:28] things and as I speak, I pray that as we
[50:31] already have prayed in the study this
[50:34] morning that you will give utterance,
[50:37] divine utterance, that you will bless
[50:40] the people, Lord, as they receive it.
[50:43] And may there be an expectation, an
[50:46] anticipation, oh God, for the hour that
[50:49] we're in. And help me to deliver, oh
[50:51] Lord, what you would have spoken. And
[50:53] then, Father, as we take this series, I
[50:56] believe, Lord, as we will be taking
[50:59] further services on this, I pray that
[51:01] you'll make them a blessing. Now, anoint
[51:04] us mightily in the name of Jesus Christ.
[51:06] We receive it. We thank you for it.
[51:09] Amen.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:11] All right, we're reading
[51:14] verses 1, 2, and 3. Habac 2.
[51:18] I will stand upon my watch, and set me
[51:21] upon the tower, and will watch to see
[51:24] what he will say unto me, and what I
[51:28] shall answer when I am reproved.
[51:31] And the Lord answered me and said,
[51:34] "Write the vision, and make it plain
[51:37] upon tables, that he may run that
[51:40] readeth it. For the vision is yet for an
[51:44] appointed time, but at the end it shall
[51:48] speak and not lie. Though it tar, wait
[51:53] for it, because it will surely come, it
[51:58] will not tarry." Amen.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love that third verse because it
[52:04] is so applicable to what we have to say
[52:07] concerning the seals and going into this
[52:09] first seal. For the vision is yet for an
[52:12] appointed time, but at the end it shall
[52:16] speak and not lie, though it tar.
[52:21] Wait for it because it will surely come.
[52:24] It will not tarry. The vision is for an
[52:27] appointed time. And I want to take a
[52:30] text uh a title this morning. From the
[52:34] time of the revealing to the time of the
[52:38] fulfillment. From the time of the
[52:41] revealing to the time of the
[52:44] fulfillment. And that's what that's
[52:46] where we are. The vision has been spoken
[52:51] and it has been revealed. But from the
[52:54] time of the revealing to the time of the
[52:57] fulfillment, there are many, many events
[53:00] which take place and will take place,
[53:04] but it shall surely come to pass.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[53:10] Keep your Bibles open if you would.
[53:14] a scripture that
[53:18] we are very very familiar with
[53:22] and sometime we need to look at a
[53:24] scripture
[53:26] and ponder it very deeply and also we
[53:29] need the author the Holy Spirit to make
[53:33] these scriptures real to us. And we know
[53:35] that all things work together for good
[53:39] to them that love God and to them who
[53:42] are the called according to his purpose.
[53:47] For whom he did forno.
[53:50] He also did predestinate to be conformed
[53:54] to the image of his son that he might be
[53:58] the firstborn among many brethren.
[54:03] For whom he did forno, he also did
[54:06] predestinate to be conformed to the
[54:09] image of his son.
[54:13] And so in the predestination, it says
[54:16] whom he did forno, he also did
[54:19] predestinate to or unto. And that's a
[54:22] period of time.
[54:25] He predestinated us to be uh conformed
[54:29] to the image of his son. one of the
[54:31] great truths of the Bible. And if you
[54:36] will allow me, I'm going to go slowly
[54:39] and you can make notes if you wish. I'm
[54:42] going to try not to preach as such, but
[54:45] I I I want to stay uh very precise to
[54:49] the thoughts because I've been pondering
[54:52] this now for quite some time. But one of
[54:55] the great truths of the scripture is
[54:59] that God is sovereign. I know we know
[55:02] that and we just say, "Well, I I've
[55:04] that's just, you know, something that's
[55:06] so standard." But we do forget often
[55:09] that God is sovereign. He does things as
[55:14] he sees fit. He does it in his schedule
[55:18] and he does it how he wishes to do it.
[55:21] Amen.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; His name even his name which is in the
[55:26] very opening verses of the Bible which
[55:30] refers to him as Jehovah
[55:33] and it implies that he is as the prophet
[55:36] has said the self-existent one
[55:40] who continuously
[55:43] and increasingly
[55:45] reveals himself.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; This is our God. He continuously
[55:53] and increasingly
[55:55] reveals himself. So what you know about
[55:58] him now is not what you're going to know
[56:00] in another day because he increasingly
[56:05] &gt;&gt; and continuously
[56:07] reveals himself.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; And who
[56:11] of us humans can even begin to grasp? We
[56:15] can't even begin to comprehend
[56:18] the the the this infinite God. But we
[56:22] need to keep that as our our basic
[56:25] understanding.
[56:26] And so it is in this regard
[56:30] that God chooses when,
[56:34] how,
[56:36] and through whom
[56:38] he will reveal himself
[56:41] and to what degree.
[56:44] because he increasingly reveals himself.
[56:47] So to what degree he's going to reveal
[56:49] himself
[56:51] uh and to make himself known.
[56:54] Paul said in Romans, "Oh the depth of
[56:58] the riches both of the wisdom and
[57:00] knowledge of God, how uncarchable are
[57:03] his judgments and his ways past finding
[57:07] out. For who hath known the mind of the
[57:11] Lord? or who hath been his counselor.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; It's abundantly clear
[57:19] that he has established that God has
[57:22] established certain offices,
[57:26] positions I will say, persons
[57:30] with specific duties which I will call
[57:33] an office. We call it these various
[57:35] offices which God establishes. And he's
[57:38] established these offices to fulfill
[57:42] these certain duties and
[57:44] responsibilities.
[57:47] And these offices have been ordained by
[57:50] God to express a certain part of
[57:53] himself. Then if you take all of these
[57:56] offices in their aggregate and and their
[58:00] sum total, then you see more of God.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; God gives us life as individuals.
[58:08] a man, a boy, a girl. They're born,
[58:11] they're raised up. Then they become
[58:14] adults and then uh they
[58:20] say become uh a a a groom and she
[58:24] becomes a a bride and they become
[58:27] married. They are they're entering into
[58:30] an office. When a young man, young woman
[58:32] when they marry, then they actually
[58:35] enter into an office because now one
[58:37] becomes a husband and a and a girl
[58:40] becomes a wife. Those are offices which
[58:43] have been set out in the scripture and
[58:45] then they become a father or mother if
[58:47] they have children. Those are offices
[58:50] and God has uh he has instituted that
[58:53] those offices have not only certain
[58:56] responsibilities but also are that they
[59:00] they require and demand certain amount
[59:02] of respect and recognition and then God
[59:05] has offices such as uh I will just
[59:08] mention some a priest a priest in the
[59:12] scripture and I'm I'm moving now all of
[59:14] this is essential for move into the into
[59:17] the seal
[59:19] A priest for every high priest, the
[59:22] scripture says in Hebrews 5:1, is is
[59:25] taken from among men is ordained for
[59:30] men. Now, a high priest is taken from
[59:32] man, and he's ordained
[59:35] for men. He's ordained for the people in
[59:38] things pertaining to God. So, now we
[59:41] have someone who is going to stand and
[59:44] represent the people before God.
[59:48] He's pertaining things to God that may
[59:52] offer
[59:54] that he may offer both gifts and
[59:56] sacrifices for sins.
[59:59] Now, you know, I just want you to be
[1:00:01] careful on that. For every high priest
[1:00:04] that's taken from among men is ordained
[1:00:07] is ordained by God. ate for men for the
[1:00:11] people in things pertaining to God that
[1:00:14] he may offer both gifts and sacrifices
[1:00:18] for sins for the sins of the people and
[1:00:21] God has he's God instituted this office
[1:00:25] that a high priest would be taken from
[1:00:27] among the people and that was not given
[1:00:30] to anyone else that was for the high
[1:00:31] priest whoever he was which was taken
[1:00:34] from among the people and he would offer
[1:00:37] sacrifices to God and God looked upon
[1:00:41] that and acknowledged that because God
[1:00:44] instituted the office for that purpose
[1:00:47] and and that was his duty. That was his
[1:00:49] work and so the people would receive uh
[1:00:52] would be recognized that would be
[1:00:54] recognized by God on behalf of the
[1:00:56] people. Now a prophet is another office
[1:01:00] and and a very fa a very common
[1:01:02] scripture to us in Amos 3:7. And surely
[1:01:06] the Lord God will do nothing, but he
[1:01:09] revealth his secrets unto his servants,
[1:01:12] the prophets. That's quite clear and
[1:01:15] that's uncomplicated. The Lord will do
[1:01:18] nothing. But you know, amazing as simple
[1:01:20] as that is. There's multitudes of people
[1:01:23] that won't accept that.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; They just won't accept that. I hear from
[1:01:28] God myself. God spoke to me. But the but
[1:01:31] the uh the testimony of their life
[1:01:33] doesn't indicate that they heard from
[1:01:35] God.
[1:01:37] Then we have the office of the king. You
[1:01:40] understand I'm going through prophet,
[1:01:41] priest and king.
[1:01:44] Through the king
[1:01:46] uh the psalmist David who was a great
[1:01:48] king and whose kingdom was set up that
[1:01:51] God promised would be an everlasting
[1:01:53] kingdom. He said, "Great deliverance
[1:01:56] giveth he to his king, to his king, and
[1:02:00] showeth mercy to his anointed, to David,
[1:02:04] and to his seed forever more." Another
[1:02:08] scripture regarding that, Pilate
[1:02:10] therefore said unto him, unto Jesus,
[1:02:13] "Art thou a king then?" And Jesus
[1:02:16] answered, "Thou sayest that I am a king.
[1:02:20] To this end was I born, and for this
[1:02:23] cause came I into the world, that I
[1:02:26] should bear witness unto the truth, and
[1:02:28] every man that heareth every and
[1:02:32] everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[1:02:35] voice. Are you a king? He said in the
[1:02:38] judgment hall,
[1:02:40] he said, to this end was I born to be a
[1:02:44] king.
[1:02:48] Now we have just established those
[1:02:51] offices.
[1:02:54] And then
[1:02:56] I want to just move from that now and
[1:02:59] make reference to on occasion
[1:03:03] on rare occasions
[1:03:06] God has allowed these offices to
[1:03:08] converge.
[1:03:10] God has allowed them to converge.
[1:03:13] We have a strange
[1:03:16] society that we live in
[1:03:20] because in this Eden, Satan's Eden,
[1:03:25] Satan has also determined that he would
[1:03:29] switch the roles of the offices
[1:03:33] of husband and wife
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; and who should have who should have the
[1:03:39] headship. And the scriptur is very
[1:03:41] clear. I'm not here to preach on it this
[1:03:44] morning, but it's also very very evident
[1:03:48] that our society suffers enormous
[1:03:51] difficulties from this switching of the
[1:03:54] roles and the converging of what's
[1:03:57] husband and what's wife and what's man
[1:03:59] and what's woman and where their
[1:04:02] position is. God has stated what they're
[1:04:04] to be and that's what they should remain
[1:04:06] to be. And when you get outside of that,
[1:04:09] the whole the whole cycle of the family
[1:04:13] becomes elliptical and it gets way off
[1:04:15] balance and goes into chaos.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; But there is some God in the scripture
[1:04:25] has allowed some overlapping or some
[1:04:29] converging
[1:04:30] of the offices. For example, brother
[1:04:34] Brandham says, and it's clear that
[1:04:36] there's never two major prophets on the
[1:04:39] earth, major prophets. He said a lot of
[1:04:41] minor prophets, but not major prophets
[1:04:44] on the earth at the same time. And this
[1:04:47] is what he says. God always deals with
[1:04:50] one individual.
[1:04:52] Two men, two men's got two ideas. There
[1:04:57] never was two major prophets on the
[1:05:00] earth prophesying at the same time. Look
[1:05:04] back and see if there was. No, sir. Two
[1:05:08] too much scrupled up. He's got to get
[1:05:11] one man completely surrendered to use
[1:05:15] that person. He searches for that
[1:05:17] person, but there will be one sometime
[1:05:21] somebody who will listen to him word by
[1:05:24] word.
[1:05:26] When we come to the church ages, the
[1:05:29] church ages over overlapped one another.
[1:05:31] Now, each age had a messenger.
[1:05:35] And so, you've got a messenger, you've
[1:05:37] got a church age with a messenger whose
[1:05:40] message is being spoken during that
[1:05:42] church age. But now, Brother Brham's
[1:05:44] very distinct and he deals with it more
[1:05:46] than once where an age will overlap with
[1:05:48] the other age. So, you really have the
[1:05:51] message of two messengers that is
[1:05:53] merging at some point.
[1:05:55] where one is fading off and the other's
[1:05:58] just starting start beginning.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; And so he says in regard to that he said
[1:06:05] in order to understand
[1:06:07] the wealth of meaning involved in in
[1:06:10] this scripture he's quoting behold I set
[1:06:13] before you an open door and no man can
[1:06:16] shut it. He said, "We must we must now
[1:06:19] recall what has been said about each age
[1:06:23] running over into another age. There is
[1:06:27] an overlapping,
[1:06:30] a melting or fading into
[1:06:34] rather than an abrupt end and a clearcut
[1:06:38] start. This age particularly flows into
[1:06:42] the next age. And not only does this age
[1:06:46] overflow into the last age, but the last
[1:06:48] age in many respects simply a carrying
[1:06:52] on of the sixth age. The seventh age
[1:06:54] said is is merely carrying on of the
[1:06:57] sixth age. The seventh age, a very short
[1:06:59] age, gathers up into itself for one
[1:07:03] quick work all the evil of every age.
[1:07:07] See, it's accumulation
[1:07:09] of every age. And the last age, the last
[1:07:14] message to the last to the last age and
[1:07:16] the elect of the last age will be a
[1:07:19] gathering up of all the righteousness
[1:07:22] of all that has been down through the
[1:07:24] ages. Luther broke out with
[1:07:26] justification. We have justification
[1:07:29] today such as Luther never understood
[1:07:31] it. We have sanctification today such as
[1:07:34] Wesley never understood it. So we
[1:07:37] haven't only we've garnered what they
[1:07:39] have and it has been intensified by this
[1:07:43] God who increasingly and continuously
[1:07:47] reveals himself because that was a
[1:07:50] revelation God was revealing to Luther
[1:07:53] and to Columba and to Wesley and on down
[1:07:55] through the ages was re revealing
[1:07:58] himself and that revelation was was of
[1:08:02] this of of God and the the people that
[1:08:05] received received it. They got that
[1:08:07] message. But in the last age, the
[1:08:09] Leodysian age, he said that the
[1:08:11] Leodysian age quickly comes in bringing
[1:08:14] both the tears and the wheat to harvest.
[1:08:19] Now,
[1:08:21] in the first seal,
[1:08:24] uh,
[1:08:26] I'd like you to turn in your Bibles if
[1:08:28] you would to Revelation the fifth
[1:08:30] chapter
[1:08:32] because in the fifth seal, brother
[1:08:34] Brandham actually deals with
[1:08:38] uh, chapter five in particular, the
[1:08:41] breach. That's the breach chapter.
[1:09:00] And I saw, starting with verse one, and
[1:09:02] I saw in the right hand of him that sat
[1:09:04] on the throne, a book written within,
[1:09:07] and on the backside sealed with seven
[1:09:10] seals. And I saw a strong angel
[1:09:14] proclaiming with a loud voice, who is
[1:09:17] worthy to open the book, and to loose
[1:09:20] the seals thereof. Now, I'd like you to
[1:09:22] notice the characters which are being
[1:09:27] identified by John in this chapter as we
[1:09:30] read it. The first thing he saw on the
[1:09:33] right in the right hand of uh I saw in
[1:09:37] the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:09:40] throne. So there's one hymn that sat on
[1:09:43] the throne. That is one that is that is
[1:09:47] identified. And then I saw a strong
[1:09:49] angel proclaiming with a loud voice who
[1:09:53] is worthy to open the book. Now we have
[1:09:55] a second character which has become
[1:09:58] visible in the in the book. And no man
[1:10:01] in heaven nor in earth nor under the
[1:10:05] earth was able to open the book, neither
[1:10:07] to look thereon. And I wept much because
[1:10:11] no man was found worthy to open and to
[1:10:14] read the book, neither to look thereon.
[1:10:17] And one of the elders, now another one
[1:10:20] has come into the picture, said unto me,
[1:10:23] weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe
[1:10:26] of Judah, the root of David, hath
[1:10:30] prevailed to open the book, and to loose
[1:10:33] the seven seals thereof. Now the lion
[1:10:37] represents a king and that's the kingly
[1:10:39] office. So the kingly office now comes
[1:10:43] into the into view into John's view and
[1:10:46] the lion the elder says the lion has
[1:10:50] prevailed.
[1:10:51] He's conquered the brother Brandham says
[1:10:54] he's conquered. He's prevailed to open
[1:10:56] the book and to loose the seven seals
[1:10:59] thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the
[1:11:02] midst of the throne, and of the four
[1:11:05] beasts, and in the midst of the elders
[1:11:08] stood a lamb. The lamb is a priest.
[1:11:11] Always a priest. And so here's now he
[1:11:15] sees a priest. A lamb as it had been
[1:11:18] slain. He was wounded. He's been in
[1:11:20] battle. Having seven horns and seven
[1:11:23] eyes, which are the seven spirits of
[1:11:25] God, sent forth into all the earth. And
[1:11:28] he came. Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; The lamb came
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; and took the book out of the right hand
[1:11:36] of him that sat upon the throne. Now,
[1:11:39] just turn the page. Go to chapter 6
[1:11:43] and we're going to look at verse one.
[1:11:46] And I saw when the lamb opened one of
[1:11:49] the seals, and I heard as it were the
[1:11:52] voice of thunder, one of the four beasts
[1:11:55] saying, "Come and see." And I saw and
[1:11:59] beheld a white horse, and he that sat on
[1:12:02] him had a bow, and a crown was given
[1:12:05] unto him, and he went forth conquering
[1:12:08] and to conquer. But verse one says, "And
[1:12:11] I saw when the lamb
[1:12:14] opened one of the seals." Now chapter
[1:12:17] five is saying, "And the lion,
[1:12:21] the lion, the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:12:24] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[1:12:28] the seven seals thereof." But now
[1:12:31] chapter six says that the lamb opened
[1:12:35] the seal. So now we have two things
[1:12:38] happening and these are critical.
[1:12:40] Absolutely critical. And you'll see
[1:12:42] where I'm coming to in just a little
[1:12:44] while. Listen very closely
[1:12:47] because this is our hour.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; These events are in our time and it's
[1:12:53] critical that we understand them really
[1:12:55] is so we have now the lion. So we have
[1:12:59] that office in possession and the lion
[1:13:03] of the tribe of Judah has prevailed.
[1:13:06] He's conquered to and he's taken the he
[1:13:11] has
[1:13:13] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[1:13:16] the seven seals thereof. Now I want to
[1:13:18] stop there. The seal is a symbol.
[1:13:23] That's what the prophet says all the way
[1:13:26] through. How it was sealed was and how
[1:13:29] it was made a mystery is
[1:13:32] that he made a statement. It's it it's
[1:13:35] like a parable said I saw a white horse
[1:13:41] and he that rode on him had a bow and he
[1:13:45] went out to conquer conquering and to
[1:13:48] conquer and that is in parable form that
[1:13:52] is in symbol form and brother Brandham
[1:13:55] calls it symbol and the symbol is what
[1:13:58] sealed it.
[1:14:00] Now, it was the lamb that actually
[1:14:04] opened the seal. And when the first seal
[1:14:09] was opened, and the lamb opened the
[1:14:12] seal, only the lamb could do that. See,
[1:14:15] no man could do that. But he was worthy
[1:14:18] because he had paid the price. And so,
[1:14:20] he was able to, and I want to put it in
[1:14:23] language that we'll understand. So he
[1:14:26] utters his voice or he speaks and the
[1:14:29] thunder is the voice of God. So the
[1:14:32] thunder utters when the seal is open
[1:14:35] there's a thunder and the thunder is
[1:14:38] God's voice which is present at that
[1:14:41] time and God has to have a a absolutely
[1:14:46] confirmed voice. He cannot have
[1:14:49] something that came out of a school of
[1:14:51] theology. He can't have something that's
[1:14:53] been taught by man. He's got to bring of
[1:14:56] He's got to use the office of a prophet.
[1:14:58] He's got to bring him from the
[1:15:00] wilderness as it were, untaught by man,
[1:15:04] unnoticed by man, unrecognized by man,
[1:15:09] because now he's got to show him forth
[1:15:12] that he is he is uh his ministry is of
[1:15:15] such a supernatural nature that no one
[1:15:19] can argue with it. It is absolutely
[1:15:23] supernatural. It's God on the scene. And
[1:15:26] then God utters his voice through that.
[1:15:30] And what happens is it's the seal is
[1:15:34] dissolved.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; The symbol is dissolved. That's how it
[1:15:39] disappears. It's dissolved. If I tell
[1:15:42] you something in a parable and say, "Uh,
[1:15:45] I'm mystified by that. I don't
[1:15:46] understand that." And then I continue on
[1:15:49] say what it really means is that this
[1:15:52] this means that and this means something
[1:15:54] else and you say oh okay I say it and
[1:15:57] now it's all your mind is illuminated
[1:15:59] and you understand it. So God did not
[1:16:02] want these things to be known in
[1:16:05] previous ages. So he he only allowed it
[1:16:08] in symbol form and when John saw it he
[1:16:12] saw these symbols and he wrote them
[1:16:13] down. I saw a white horse. I saw a red
[1:16:17] horse. I saw a black horse. And he wrote
[1:16:20] down and and the rider and what he was
[1:16:22] doing and what followed afterwards and
[1:16:24] it remained in symbol form. And man all
[1:16:27] down through the years has studied and
[1:16:30] took the Greek and took the Hebrew and
[1:16:34] took all what it might mean this and it
[1:16:37] might mean that but that's not
[1:16:39] sufficient. There has to be someone say
[1:16:42] this is not me. This is not man. This is
[1:16:46] not from a book. This is thus sayaeth
[1:16:49] the Lord. The same one that told me your
[1:16:51] name is the same one that told me this.
[1:16:54] And you can have confidence in it.
[1:17:00] And so now we have the converging.
[1:17:04] And here's a um
[1:17:08] he says that Revelation the 5th chapter
[1:17:11] this is not the seven seals. It is the
[1:17:14] breach between the church ages and the
[1:17:17] seven seals. It's the breach between the
[1:17:20] church ages and the seven seals. I don't
[1:17:23] have them here. You've seen me do this
[1:17:25] before. just for the younger ones coming
[1:17:27] up and maybe newer ones and those
[1:17:29] visiting. If I had the church age book
[1:17:32] here and the sales book here and held
[1:17:35] them together, the church ages, you
[1:17:38] know, remember church is always in the
[1:17:42] feminine gender.
[1:17:44] Church, that's the era of the woman. The
[1:17:48] seals is not a feminine gender. And the
[1:17:52] fact is the prophet says the seals are
[1:17:55] Christ.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; And so we have the woman and the man.
[1:18:00] But and the opening of the seals is the
[1:18:02] dissolving of the seals or the
[1:18:05] dissolving of the parable. So that what
[1:18:08] the seal means can now be spoken to the
[1:18:13] people. And the and the seal it was
[1:18:15] Christ who had himself sealed up.
[1:18:19] He had let himself be known. That's why
[1:18:21] he continuously
[1:18:23] and increasingly
[1:18:26] reveals himself. And so he allowed
[1:18:29] himself to be known through the offices
[1:18:32] of the reformers. And allowed himself to
[1:18:35] be known this way. And he allowed
[1:18:36] himself to be known and and as time went
[1:18:40] on he had a everinccreasing
[1:18:43] unveiling of himself. But in the end
[1:18:46] time, there can be no secrets anymore
[1:18:49] because it's marriage time.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; And the woman that he's been calling
[1:18:54] down through the centuries has to be his
[1:18:57] bride. But in the end time, there has to
[1:19:00] be an elect woman called out. Come out
[1:19:03] from among them, and be ye separate,
[1:19:06] sayeth the Lord, because this lamb of
[1:19:09] God is going to reveal himself in his
[1:19:12] fullness.
[1:19:15] that has been ordained for the hour so
[1:19:18] that she will know who he is. There will
[1:19:20] be no mistake, no misunderstanding, and
[1:19:23] they will in a in in a a love
[1:19:27] relationship be united in marriage.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; And so now we have the church age and
[1:19:35] the seals book. And before brother
[1:19:38] Brandham can come to the first seal, the
[1:19:40] message just prior to the first seal is
[1:19:44] chapter five which is the breach between
[1:19:48] the church ages. Chapters 1, 2, and
[1:19:51] three. Chapter four, God shows God shows
[1:19:55] John the scene in heaven. And chapter
[1:19:58] five, he begins to show him the activity
[1:20:02] of what's taking place there. So,
[1:20:05] chapters 1, 2, and three are the church
[1:20:08] ages and what is happening over these
[1:20:10] 2,000 years. Chapter 4, John is carried
[1:20:14] up and he sees the scene in heaven.
[1:20:17] Chapter five, now he sees what is
[1:20:20] actually beginning to take place in
[1:20:22] heaven. In chapter five is is the re the
[1:20:26] claiming watch closely is the lamb
[1:20:30] claiming the book because the book is
[1:20:33] not a book like this. The book has your
[1:20:36] name in it
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; and your name is actually your life.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; The expression of your life on earth is
[1:20:43] in that book
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; and everything is in that book. Amen.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Every deed, every thought that you don't
[1:20:50] want, everything because that was the
[1:20:53] that was the book of life or the record
[1:20:55] of life. But now when the lamb comes
[1:20:59] from the midst and he comes to the one
[1:21:02] who's on the throne, he comes and takes
[1:21:05] takes that book. He is claiming that
[1:21:08] book. Now the book becomes the lamb's
[1:21:11] book of life. And you must remember the
[1:21:14] bleach, the blood, the Clorox which he
[1:21:18] has given is the only remedy for the sin
[1:21:23] on the things iniquities that's recorded
[1:21:26] in the book.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; And so brother Brandham says it looks
[1:21:29] like it's two books. It's not. It's one
[1:21:31] that flows into the other. And so
[1:21:33] there's a book of life. But now this
[1:21:36] becomes the lamb's book of life. And
[1:21:38] that's why every sin of the Old
[1:21:41] Testament, all the all the failures of
[1:21:43] the Old Testament do not pass into the
[1:21:46] New Testament. Abraham lied in the Old
[1:21:49] Testament. When you get to the New
[1:21:50] Testament, there's no record of his lie.
[1:21:53] He backslid in the Old Testament. No
[1:21:55] record that he backslid. Uh uh David
[1:21:59] took another man's wife, Ba Sheba. No
[1:22:02] record of it in the New Testament.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because it passed through
[1:22:07] Calvary and there's none of that on this
[1:22:10] side of Calvary. Hallelujah. What a
[1:22:12] rejoicing it is. And so the the book of
[1:22:15] life became the lamb's book of life when
[1:22:18] the lamb took the book and he was the
[1:22:20] only one that could take it. A king
[1:22:22] couldn't take it. It wasn't in the
[1:22:24] king's office. It was the lamb that
[1:22:26] could take the book. Hallelujah. And
[1:22:28] that is why the one that stood by the
[1:22:30] prophet messenger on earth was that same
[1:22:33] one
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; and told him this is the disease. That's
[1:22:37] the person told him before he came to
[1:22:39] the platform. This is what you're going
[1:22:41] to see. There's demon-possessed people.
[1:22:43] This one's got epilepsy. He'll try to
[1:22:45] get away from you, but you'll he got
[1:22:47] away from the doctors, but he won't get
[1:22:49] away from you.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:52] That's the kind of vindicated voice that
[1:22:55] was there because he had to confirm him
[1:22:57] for 30 years. So the first three and a
[1:22:59] half last three and a half years the
[1:23:01] same length of ministry as our Lord
[1:23:03] Jesus Christ. He would then give the
[1:23:05] thoughts of God to the people concerning
[1:23:07] this
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; which had been sealed.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; We had bits and pieces but it had not
[1:23:14] been fully revealed. Amen.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; In the Philadelphiaian church age, he
[1:23:22] said, "In order to understand, oh yes, I
[1:23:25] read that where the one is flowing into
[1:23:27] the other." And so then one of the
[1:23:29] elders said unto me, "Weep not, John,
[1:23:32] the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[1:23:35] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[1:23:38] the seals thereof." He said in the first
[1:23:40] seal, now we find also in this that as
[1:23:44] soon as John heard the announcement
[1:23:47] for the kinsman redeemer to come forth
[1:23:50] and to make his claims,
[1:23:52] notice now as soon as John heard the
[1:23:56] announcement for the kinsman redeemer to
[1:23:58] come forth and to make his claims, there
[1:24:01] was no man that could do it. No man in
[1:24:03] heaven, no man in earth, no man beneath
[1:24:06] the earth. And no one was worthy even to
[1:24:10] look at the book. Just think of that. No
[1:24:13] person at all worthy even to look at it.
[1:24:17] And John started weeping. He said there
[1:24:21] was no chance for redemption.
[1:24:24] Then everything has failed.
[1:24:27] And quickly we find that his weeping
[1:24:29] stopped quickly because it was announced
[1:24:33] that by one of the elders, one of the
[1:24:36] elders said, "Don't weep, John, for the
[1:24:38] lion of the tribe of Judah hath
[1:24:41] prevailed." In other words, overcome and
[1:24:44] has conquered.
[1:24:47] And then I'm I'm repeating now. And I
[1:24:50] beheld, and lo, in the midst of the
[1:24:52] throne, and of the four beasts, and in
[1:24:55] the midst of the elders stood a lamb, as
[1:24:58] it had been slain, having seven horns
[1:25:00] and seven eyes, which are the seven
[1:25:02] spirits of God, sent forth into all the
[1:25:06] earth. And so now we have both the lion
[1:25:09] king office and the lamb priest office
[1:25:13] represented at the time of the opening
[1:25:17] of the seals.
[1:25:20] I want you to listen real close
[1:25:24] because this had never happened before.
[1:25:27] Quite frankly,
[1:25:29] I may be misunderstood.
[1:25:31] I don't believe I should be. That is why
[1:25:35] there is not in recorded history a
[1:25:38] ministry like William Brham's
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; because it was in his ministry.
[1:25:47] It was it wasn't his choosing.
[1:25:50] It was in his ministry where these
[1:25:53] offices had to converge.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; The lamb priest and the lion king.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; I will go a step further. I will say
[1:26:05] that the first part of his ministry
[1:26:10] and I will read that to you and prove it
[1:26:12] to you in a very lengthy reading in a
[1:26:14] few moments. But in the first part of
[1:26:16] his ministry, the great
[1:26:20] spiritual leaders of the day identified
[1:26:24] that that was the ministry of Jesus
[1:26:26] Christ as they see it in the scripture
[1:26:30] because in the scripture they have it
[1:26:33] they have it foretold and they see his
[1:26:36] his priesthood ministry
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; and accepted that. Now notice please
[1:26:44] when Elijah came in the form of John the
[1:26:47] Baptist
[1:26:49] and John
[1:26:52] John was recognized as a prophet and
[1:26:55] Jesus and John were only perhaps six
[1:26:57] months apart in their age
[1:27:00] and John now
[1:27:02] the sacrifice had to be washed. Jesus
[1:27:05] was coming to John as far as the world
[1:27:07] was concerned it was his cousin. He was
[1:27:10] coming to him on the banks of the river.
[1:27:12] John is down there blasting the whole
[1:27:15] generation.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; You
[1:27:19] vipers,
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Repent
[1:27:23] and don't say we have Moses. Said God's
[1:27:26] able of these stones or don't say we
[1:27:28] have Abraham. God's able of these stones
[1:27:31] to raise up children to Abraham. And it
[1:27:33] was startling them. Who is this wild man
[1:27:36] who came from the desert and with camel
[1:27:39] skin and eating wild honey and locust?
[1:27:41] Who is this man? And they were attracted
[1:27:44] to him.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; And he's declaring now and he is a
[1:27:48] prophet. He is Elijah. And he's
[1:27:51] declaring there's one among you who you
[1:27:53] know not.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; And he didn't know at that time. He
[1:27:58] didn't know who it was. But he said, "He
[1:28:00] that sent me has told me on whom I see
[1:28:04] the the star, the light descending, he
[1:28:08] is the one that will baptize with the
[1:28:10] Holy Ghost." And he sees Jesus the next
[1:28:12] day coming. This is he of whom I spake.
[1:28:16] And he says, "Behold," he didn't say,
[1:28:18] "Behold the prophet of God," but behold
[1:28:22] the lamb of God. Because with that
[1:28:25] statement, the lamb of God, he was
[1:28:28] speaking to people who understood God's
[1:28:30] principle that he was pointing to
[1:28:33] another office. This is not a prophet
[1:28:35] office. He doesn't say this is God's
[1:28:38] prophet. He says this is the lamb of
[1:28:41] God. This is God's lamb. This is God's
[1:28:45] sacrifice. And they were offended
[1:28:49] because they knew the sacrifice had to
[1:28:51] bleed. And of course, they were not to
[1:28:53] be children of God in the first place.
[1:28:55] They were they they were serpent seed.
[1:28:58] Jesus said, "You are of your father, the
[1:29:00] devil, and his deeds you do." And they
[1:29:04] took up stones to stone them because
[1:29:05] they had murder in their heart. Exactly
[1:29:08] like Cain had. Exactly like Satan had
[1:29:12] had murder in their heart. And so and
[1:29:16] and they could not catch that
[1:29:17] revelation. the religious order of the
[1:29:20] day. They recognized his prophet part,
[1:29:24] but they could not recognize his
[1:29:26] priesthood part. And he had to die. His
[1:29:30] blood was shed. He entered into the
[1:29:32] presence of God with his blood and
[1:29:34] became our high priest.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; And that is why he's been a priest all
[1:29:39] through these 2,000 years under the
[1:29:41] dispensation of the Holy Spirit. He was
[1:29:43] priest. And so when the prophet when
[1:29:46] brother Brandham comes he does exactly
[1:29:49] what John did initially. He began to
[1:29:52] speak to the people draw great crowds to
[1:29:54] to himself not to himself but for the
[1:29:57] purpose of introducing the lamb priest.
[1:30:01] Now here comes the prophet and he comes
[1:30:04] and that is why the church world
[1:30:06] accepted him because he demonstrated
[1:30:09] Christ in his priesthood and we become
[1:30:12] accustomed to that priesthood for 2,000
[1:30:15] years. So there was nothing startling
[1:30:18] about brother Brandham's early ministry.
[1:30:21] They just accepted it. They were
[1:30:23] delighted with it. And I'm going to read
[1:30:25] what Tommy Osburn said about it. They
[1:30:27] were absolutely taken by it. They were
[1:30:30] enamored by it. They said things that
[1:30:32] people in the message don't want to say.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; He said clearly this was God in the
[1:30:38] flesh again.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; And yet we're unable to catch the king
[1:30:46] lion part because the lion when you talk
[1:30:49] about a king you're now talking about
[1:30:52] the judicial system. You're talking
[1:30:54] about authority. You're talking about
[1:30:57] laying the law down. And there's no ifs,
[1:31:01] ands, or buts about it. And now we have
[1:31:03] a ministry that doesn't just say, "Oh,
[1:31:05] sister. Oh, brother, you feel that
[1:31:07] presence? That's him. That's not me.
[1:31:09] That's my voice, but that's not me
[1:31:11] speaking." And uh who would know your
[1:31:13] name and who would know? And they're
[1:31:14] weeping and all the rest. But but now he
[1:31:16] has to come and speak. I indict this
[1:31:19] generation.
[1:31:20] Amen.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Had to speak the trial.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Our stand is his defense.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; This is the trial.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; See, this was different.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; And that was the part they couldn't
[1:31:37] catch.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; They had their idea of Genesis and the
[1:31:41] garden and the original sin. But now it
[1:31:44] begins to be declared what it really was
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; and how it followed all the way up.
[1:31:50] Well, how how in the world is a
[1:31:52] generation that's being controlled by
[1:31:54] Satan himself, how are they going to how
[1:31:57] is he going to and laying there in the
[1:31:59] in the weeds of the religious order of
[1:32:02] the day? How in the world is he going to
[1:32:04] accept a man who's uncovering him?
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; How's he going to accept? How are those
[1:32:11] religious leaders going to accept when
[1:32:12] the curtain the the veil is pulled off
[1:32:15] and they're exposed and their hypocrisy
[1:32:17] is exposed? How are they going to accept
[1:32:19] that? How's Rome going to accept it when
[1:32:22] they were the ones who tortured and
[1:32:23] murdered 68 million? How are they going
[1:32:26] to accept it? They can't accept it. And
[1:32:28] and here comes a prophet and tears the
[1:32:31] veil off of that false trinity doctrine
[1:32:34] and that false baptism by which they win
[1:32:37] millions into their church as
[1:32:38] membership. And he's telling them
[1:32:40] membership means nothing. You got to be
[1:32:43] born again.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; How could they accept it? They couldn't
[1:32:48] accept it.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; And so on one hand, he was popular. He's
[1:32:54] popular with the demonstration and the
[1:32:57] manifestation of the priest of the lamb
[1:33:00] priest office, but when it come to the
[1:33:03] king lion office, he couldn't. And both
[1:33:06] of those converged in his ministry.
[1:33:09] And that's why he was such a paradox.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; And that's why you were such a paradox.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; There's things about your life, things
[1:33:19] about this church that people they love,
[1:33:22] they admire, they wish they could have
[1:33:24] it, but they cannot accept it because
[1:33:27] they cannot believe the word.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; I said I wouldn't preach, but I have a
[1:33:34] wee bit. Amen.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; So the elements
[1:33:42] the elements of prophet priest and king
[1:33:46] lion are present in the message
[1:33:50] and the prophet priest ministry is so
[1:33:54] very evident. The prophet priest
[1:33:56] ministry is so very evident in brother
[1:33:59] Brandham's early ministry.
[1:34:02] Now I have some slides here and these
[1:34:06] will raise some questions.
[1:34:09] So if we just put up the first slide
[1:34:11] first.
[1:34:14] The first three chapters of Revelation
[1:34:18] is the seven church ages. John is caught
[1:34:21] up in the fourth chapter to see things
[1:34:23] which was which is and which is to come.
[1:34:28] Remember that now. Which was which is
[1:34:30] and which is to come. The lion of the
[1:34:32] tribe of Judah has prevailed, in other
[1:34:34] words, to overcome and has conquered.
[1:34:38] And one of the elders sith unto me, weep
[1:34:40] not. Behold, the lion of the tribe of
[1:34:43] Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed
[1:34:45] to open the book, and to loose the seven
[1:34:48] seals thereof.
[1:34:51] Christ on earth was an eagle. When he
[1:34:54] died, he was a priest. So that made him
[1:34:56] a lamb. And when he comes again, he's
[1:34:59] king. So he'll be a lion. The lion of
[1:35:02] the tribe of Judah. He's an eagle, a
[1:35:04] lamb, and a lion. Amen. Father, son, and
[1:35:08] holy ghost, prophet, priest, and king.
[1:35:11] He was that which is and shall come, the
[1:35:15] almighty, alpha, and omega from the
[1:35:18] beginning to the end, the eternal God.
[1:35:22] And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of
[1:35:24] the throne, and of the four beasts, and
[1:35:26] in the midst of the elders stood a lamb
[1:35:28] as it had been slain, having seven horns
[1:35:31] and seven eyes, which are the seven
[1:35:33] spirits sent forth into all the earth.
[1:35:35] Now uh
[1:35:40] I want to go to
[1:35:43] now that is uh slide five. Now the fifth
[1:35:48] slide.
[1:35:50] And he came and took the book.
[1:35:53] He came and took the book out of the
[1:35:55] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:35:57] throne. Now this is going in sequence.
[1:36:01] Now to the
[1:36:03] these other quotes continuing in
[1:36:05] sequence. The mystery of the book are
[1:36:08] revealed when the seals are broken.
[1:36:12] And when the seals completely are
[1:36:14] broken, the time of redemption is over
[1:36:18] because the lamb left the intercession
[1:36:20] post to walk out to take his claims. I
[1:36:22] want to stop there a moment. This has
[1:36:24] created a question in the minds of a lot
[1:36:28] of people and perhaps some went
[1:36:31] overboard one way or another and we'll
[1:36:33] maybe come to that a little later on.
[1:36:35] But he says when the seals are when the
[1:36:37] seals completely are broken and the time
[1:36:41] of redemption is over because the lamb
[1:36:45] left the intercession post to walk out
[1:36:48] and take his claims. So now here we come
[1:36:51] to this this uh dilemma. I will call it
[1:36:55] dilemma because we say are the seals
[1:36:58] broken? Yes. That means that the lamb
[1:37:01] has left the intercessory seat in order
[1:37:04] to do that. When he leaves the
[1:37:06] intercessory seat, the prophet says
[1:37:08] clearly that redemption is over. There
[1:37:11] is no redemption anymore. And so some
[1:37:14] have taken that and simply declared
[1:37:18] there's no more mercy. There's no more
[1:37:20] mercy. It's over everything from there.
[1:37:23] And actually it was to their own
[1:37:25] destruction because that that failed
[1:37:28] failed miserably. I believe if we wait
[1:37:31] on the vision,
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; it will surely come to pass
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; and if we stay in the right attitude in
[1:37:39] the right atmosphere, God is duty bound
[1:37:43] to make these things known. But now the
[1:37:46] the one seed of thought that I want to
[1:37:49] sew in your mind which is critical to
[1:37:51] understanding this is when he came and
[1:37:54] took the book this it isn't that he
[1:37:57] walked across the platform or walked
[1:37:59] across the hall or walked into the next
[1:38:01] room or just walked up to the throne and
[1:38:03] said give me the book bing bang and it's
[1:38:04] all over. No, how long did that take?
[1:38:10] How long did it take when he went and
[1:38:12] took the book and began to open the
[1:38:15] seals? What what length of time was
[1:38:18] that? And then when the prophet spoke
[1:38:20] the seals, that was the revealing of it.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; But then how much time is it from the
[1:38:27] time of the revealing to the time of the
[1:38:29] fulfillment
[1:38:31] when it's all done when it's completed?
[1:38:34] So, it's revealed what happens, but it's
[1:38:37] not it's not fulfilled.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; I just going to give you an example.
[1:38:43] Just hold that right there because I'm
[1:38:45] going to come right back. That's really
[1:38:46] the nub of the message this morning as
[1:38:49] far as I want to go. But I just want to
[1:38:51] hold that for a moment.
[1:38:54] You will recall because most of you know
[1:38:56] the scriptures when God spoke to
[1:39:00] Abraham.
[1:39:03] when God spoke to Abraham
[1:39:05] and he said a a very few
[1:39:09] uh a very few verses
[1:39:16] he said to Abraham
[1:39:18] it was Abram yet had not changed his
[1:39:20] name
[1:39:23] and he told him take a heer
[1:39:27] take a uh take the turtle doves and take
[1:39:31] these
[1:39:32] and separate them. And uh and he sat
[1:39:36] beside them and a great horror of
[1:39:39] darkness came and a light came and moved
[1:39:41] through those pieces that he had
[1:39:44] sacrificed or he had not sacrificed but
[1:39:46] he had divided them as God had told him.
[1:39:48] And the Bible says, "And God said unto
[1:39:51] Abram, know of assurityity that thy seed
[1:39:55] shall be a stranger in a land that is
[1:39:58] not theirs, and shall serve them, and
[1:40:02] they shall afflict them 400 years."
[1:40:05] There's five things that God told him.
[1:40:09] Number one, thy seed shall be a a
[1:40:12] stranger in a land that's not theirs.
[1:40:14] Number one. Number two, and shall serve
[1:40:18] them.
[1:40:19] Number three, and they shall afflict
[1:40:22] them 400 years. Number four, and also
[1:40:27] that nation whom they shall serve be I
[1:40:30] will I judge. And number five, afterward
[1:40:35] they shall come out with great
[1:40:38] substance. five little short phrases
[1:40:42] that took over 400 years to fulfill.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; And I will say that when God spoke it,
[1:40:50] I'll put it in my language, God sealed
[1:40:52] it
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; because he didn't know who, where, when,
[1:41:00] what nation,
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; who is this, how's this going to happen?
[1:41:04] Knew nothing.
[1:41:07] And then centuries went by and here's a
[1:41:11] here's a runaway
[1:41:14] prophet that doesn't know he's a
[1:41:16] prophet, but he's standing in the
[1:41:18] wilderness and sees a burning bush and
[1:41:22] he moves to the bush. And now God, he
[1:41:26] speaks to him out of take your shoes
[1:41:28] off. You're standing on holy ground. and
[1:41:30] he prepares him and he's he's attracting
[1:41:33] his prophet
[1:41:35] and and God begins to speak to him and
[1:41:39] tells him, "Moreover, I am the God of ab
[1:41:43] thy father Abraham." He identifies where
[1:41:46] his roots are. He's telling him right
[1:41:48] off the bat, right at the beginning,
[1:41:50] you're not from Pharaoh.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; You're not from the palace.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; You're not from this world.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; You're of another lineage.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:00] I am of thy father. I'm the God of thy
[1:42:03] father and the God of Abraham, the God
[1:42:06] of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And
[1:42:10] Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to
[1:42:12] look upon God. And the Lord said, notice
[1:42:16] now, I have seen, I have surely seen the
[1:42:20] affliction of my people
[1:42:22] which are in Egypt, and have heard their
[1:42:26] cry by reason of their task masters. For
[1:42:29] I know their sorrows,
[1:42:32] and I am come down to deliver them. I'd
[1:42:37] like to put this also in just paragraph
[1:42:40] form. I've now come down. I've seen
[1:42:42] their affliction. First, the one who's
[1:42:45] speaking is I'm the God of a thy father
[1:42:47] Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God
[1:42:51] of Jacob. He says, "And I have seen the
[1:42:54] affliction of this people, and I have
[1:42:57] come down to deliver them out of the
[1:43:00] hand of the Egyptians." Now, what God
[1:43:03] had spoke to Abraham is taking on
[1:43:07] enormous dimensions. Now, the nation who
[1:43:11] who's been afflicting them is known. The
[1:43:13] people have been identified. What they
[1:43:16] are doing has been identified. Their
[1:43:19] crying has reached the ears of God. The
[1:43:22] whole thing has taken on a whole new
[1:43:24] meaning.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; But it was sealed back there. But now it
[1:43:28] begins to open up. But he doesn't tell
[1:43:30] Moses, "I'm going to send plagues, and
[1:43:33] you're going to bring 10 plagues. 1 2 3
[1:43:35] 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. And the 10th one's going
[1:43:38] to be death, and they're going to let
[1:43:40] you go, and you're going to borrow
[1:43:42] things off of the Egyptians, and you're
[1:43:44] going to go out with great wealth." He
[1:43:46] doesn't tell them any of that, even at
[1:43:49] the burning bush. So what is it? It's
[1:43:51] Jehovah, the great self-existent one who
[1:43:55] continuously and increasingly reveals
[1:43:58] himself.
[1:44:01] And we love him.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; And that's what he's doing in this
[1:44:04] generation. The seals had to be revealed
[1:44:08] and made known to the people because
[1:44:11] we're in the fulfillment of it.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; And it's an hour to say, "Oh, it's
[1:44:16] already over. It's already done.
[1:44:20] Someone can say well the king is here
[1:44:22] and I can say amen.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; That's fine. I can he can say well uh uh
[1:44:28] the mediatorial work is over. I can also
[1:44:32] say amen to all but the elect.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brandham said he
[1:44:38] and I got a quote here in a moment. It's
[1:44:40] predestination.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; You see God has been merciful to
[1:44:44] multitudes of people. You might say well
[1:44:47] how does this work? Where does man's
[1:44:49] free choice come? Man has a choice.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; But don't forget that God has a choice.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Every man chooses who he's going to
[1:44:58] marry.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; God has a choice.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; But this is what when Jesus came by, you
[1:45:08] have to pray for me. But when Jesus came
[1:45:11] on the scene, he said to the people,
[1:45:14] "Had I not come,
[1:45:17] you'd have no sin.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; But now there but now
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; there's no covering for your sin.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; You follow me?
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; So up to that time, God's mercy was
[1:45:32] there." You understand? Up to that time,
[1:45:36] the priest, oh God help me.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; The priest would go in and the high
[1:45:42] priest would go in once a year on behalf
[1:45:45] of the people to make sacrifice to God.
[1:45:48] And God would see the sacrifice, but not
[1:45:50] without blood. He had to go with blood.
[1:45:52] And when God saw that the blood was
[1:45:54] there from the sacrifice, here's the
[1:45:56] high priest. Here's the office I have
[1:45:58] instituted. And the people their sins
[1:46:00] were uh not erased but they were
[1:46:03] covered.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; And God acknowledged that.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Do you know that Aaron went in
[1:46:13] and he offered blood and God accepted
[1:46:17] that and the people that were out there
[1:46:20] for the most part all died in the
[1:46:23] wilderness.
[1:46:26] And yet God was covering their sin
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; by the office of that high priest.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; And yet they would die in the
[1:46:36] wilderness. And this God knew they would
[1:46:38] die in the wilderness. But he yet gave
[1:46:40] them forgiveness
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; through recognition of that office. And
[1:46:46] I will say there were many in the
[1:46:48] denominational years taking the same
[1:46:50] scene, the same principle forward.
[1:46:52] Throughout all these denominational
[1:46:54] years, they honored God and God had
[1:46:57] instituted the the message of the
[1:46:59] messengers down through the ages. But
[1:47:01] God had not confronted them yet with
[1:47:04] this prophet ministry to reject. He had
[1:47:07] not come and visited them in such a dere
[1:47:11] intensity.
[1:47:13] And as Jesus said, before I come,
[1:47:17] you do not have sin, but now there's no
[1:47:20] covering for your sin.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Is this making some sense to you?
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; And when the seals completely are
[1:47:35] broken, let's go to the next next quote,
[1:47:38] please. He was a mediator between that.
[1:47:43] But when the real revelation happens on
[1:47:45] the seals and as they begin to break,
[1:47:48] the lamb is coming forth from the
[1:47:50] sanctuary.
[1:47:52] It's according to the word. He come from
[1:47:55] out of the midst of and took the book.
[1:47:59] So he is no more mediator because even
[1:48:03] they called him a lion and that's the
[1:48:06] king and he's not a mediator then. And
[1:48:10] we'll take the next one. The lamb in the
[1:48:13] time of the intercessory. Now we just
[1:48:15] ended with the lion. Now we're going
[1:48:16] back again. He goes back the l the lamb
[1:48:19] in the time of intercessory back here.
[1:48:22] He knew that there was names in there
[1:48:26] that was not put in there. I'm sorry.
[1:48:29] That was put in there from the
[1:48:31] foundation of the world. And as long as
[1:48:34] those names have never been manifested
[1:48:37] on earth as yet, he had to stay there as
[1:48:40] intercessor. Do you get it? Perfectly.
[1:48:43] Predestination.
[1:48:45] If you miss the word predestination,
[1:48:47] you've got a conundrum because you've
[1:48:49] got an irreconcilable.
[1:48:51] You have the seals open here and you
[1:48:53] have a mediator who's already left.
[1:48:58] And so some went I think way far
[1:49:01] overboard said there's no more mercy. No
[1:49:04] listen.
[1:49:08] Mercy,
[1:49:10] love,
[1:49:12] longsuffering,
[1:49:14] anything that we could use to describe
[1:49:18] God
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; is an attribute of God.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; And he cannot diminish in that
[1:49:25] attribute. If God can diminish in his
[1:49:28] mercy, then he's not God.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; He cannot diminish. But the one thing
[1:49:34] that God can do, has done, and is doing
[1:49:39] is he restricts how that attribute can
[1:49:43] be accessed.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that.
[1:49:52] That is why I said I want to go back a
[1:49:55] moment ago. Jesus stood there now
[1:49:58] identified as the lamb of God.
[1:50:01] And God through the years that Jesus was
[1:50:04] on earth was now changing. In the in the
[1:50:07] Bible we read and the lamb came forth
[1:50:09] and took the book. I can say also from
[1:50:12] the time of Jesus' birth, 12 years old
[1:50:14] as a boy, from that time to the time he
[1:50:16] was crucified, the lamb was coming forth
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; as the redeemer.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't just that he walked across
[1:50:24] the floor and said, "Here I am. I'm the
[1:50:26] lamb and it's all over." No, it was a
[1:50:28] period of time from the time of his his
[1:50:31] his announcement, behold the lamb of God
[1:50:33] that takes the sin of the world. Now we
[1:50:36] have a year, two years, three years
[1:50:38] before he's on the cross. So we have a
[1:50:40] period of time from the time of the
[1:50:43] announcement to the time that it
[1:50:44] happens. But Jesus stood there at that
[1:50:47] time while they still had the high
[1:50:50] priest. The high priest was going in to
[1:50:53] this to the before Christ died and after
[1:50:57] he died because he died at the Passover.
[1:51:00] Are you staying with me?
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; This be a challenge to maybe some of you
[1:51:04] young people, but you hang on. Old
[1:51:06] brother Ed still got a couple things up
[1:51:08] here. Amen.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; The high priest was going in with the
[1:51:13] blood which God said if they do that
[1:51:17] they would have their sins covered. They
[1:51:20] would be forgiven. But when God's lamb
[1:51:23] came on the scene, access to mercy
[1:51:26] ceased to happen that way.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "Now there he was
[1:51:34] on the mercy seat. He's on Calvary." And
[1:51:37] the old system doesn't work anymore. And
[1:51:41] if you're going to have mercy, you have
[1:51:42] to come through him. Outside of him,
[1:51:44] there's no mercy.
[1:51:47] And so now through 2,000 years, we have
[1:51:50] a history and we have a church history
[1:51:53] of people that have uh uh that we know
[1:51:56] the lamb of God and Jesus of Nazareth
[1:51:59] and this and the sacrifice of Calvary.
[1:52:02] And it's all part of our it's part of
[1:52:04] our being. And we know that if we
[1:52:07] repent, we have forgiveness. And we if I
[1:52:10] come down, I just repent, I have
[1:52:12] forgiveness. But it's God's prerogative
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; to change the system.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; And when the lamb himself, the revealing
[1:52:21] of the son of man, when Luke 17:30 came
[1:52:24] on the scene, he was already in motion
[1:52:27] to change the system.
[1:52:30] And the old system wouldn't work
[1:52:32] anymore. And unless you come through
[1:52:35] this, you cannot find mercy.
[1:52:39] [Applause]
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Mercy didn't go any place. And the mercy
[1:52:43] seat's not a chair. The mercy seat is an
[1:52:46] attribute.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; And God can never diminish from that
[1:52:50] attribute. But how they will access it.
[1:52:52] And starting in the first seal, people
[1:52:54] got all scrupled up on it
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; and misunderstood it seriously
[1:53:02] and made terrible mistakes and went into
[1:53:04] chaos and entered much trouble.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; But it's as clear as it can be if you
[1:53:11] wait for the vision. And so there's a
[1:53:14] time from its revealing. When the
[1:53:16] prophet spoke it, he was revealing what
[1:53:18] it was. When John saw it, he wrote it.
[1:53:22] And but then now notice in Revelation
[1:53:25] 10, when the thunders uttered the seven
[1:53:27] thunders, which was the voices of God,
[1:53:30] and that was the seven thunders because
[1:53:32] it's seven voices to match the seven
[1:53:34] seals.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; And they asked Brother Brandham, "Are
[1:53:38] you going to speak on the seven
[1:53:39] thunders?" He said, "That's what the
[1:53:40] seals were all about."
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; And he says, "The thunder is the voice
[1:53:45] of God." And so people got off on the
[1:53:48] seven thunders and made a big issue of
[1:53:50] that. It's too simple.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; The thunder is the voice of God.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; And the prophet spoke the opening of the
[1:54:00] seven seals and spoke the word of God
[1:54:02] out concerning that. And that was a
[1:54:05] thunder. Don't tell me it wasn't a
[1:54:06] thunder. It's thundered all through the
[1:54:07] whole church world.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; It's thundered.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; It sure has. And that was none other
[1:54:14] than the lamb of God taking the book
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; and delivering its contents to his
[1:54:22] servant Elijah to speak its contents.
[1:54:26] And when he spoke it, the symbol
[1:54:28] dissolved.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; And so the seal was gone.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; In other words, the seal was broken
[1:54:35] because the symbol was gone. Instead,
[1:54:37] it's not just a white horse. He says the
[1:54:39] white horse is a power
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; and it's white because the one who's on
[1:54:44] it is the devil. And I've read where
[1:54:46] some thought it's the Holy Ghost. And
[1:54:48] they have all kinds of different ideas.
[1:54:50] Now we have a prophet says that's Satan
[1:54:52] on that horse. And he's riding on
[1:54:54] deception. He's riding out to deceive.
[1:54:58] But he can't deceive the people born by
[1:55:00] the word of God. He can't deceive them.
[1:55:11] And so as long as those names,
[1:55:14] and it's very specific, until the last
[1:55:17] name has actually been declared on the
[1:55:19] earth,
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; there's mercy available to that
[1:55:24] individual. Has he left the mercy seat?
[1:55:27] Yes, he left the mercy seat cuz the word
[1:55:30] says so. He left the mercy seat. But
[1:55:33] that doesn't say there is no mercy
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; because he's a god of mercy.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; That's an attribute of his.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; But what he simply said is you cannot
[1:55:45] access it any longer that way.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; We understand what access is all about.
[1:56:02] Do I have a few minutes?
[1:56:04] I want you to listen closely.
[1:56:07] This is lengthy.
[1:56:09] So don't just give me your undivided
[1:56:12] attention.
[1:56:15] Tommy Osburn.
[1:56:18] How many have heard Tommy Osburn's
[1:56:20] memorial address? I see your hands. How
[1:56:23] many have not heard it?
[1:56:25] Most of the congregation.
[1:56:28] He titles this God in flesh again.
[1:56:33] He says, 'I will read from John. This is
[1:56:35] the memorial address. And I've read on
[1:56:38] the website recently, this last week,
[1:56:40] that Tommy Osbbor is considered to have
[1:56:42] spoken to more people than any man on
[1:56:44] earth. I don't know. That's what they've
[1:56:46] said. Untold hundreds of millions of
[1:56:48] people he's spoken to in over 50 years
[1:56:50] of his ministry.
[1:56:52] It was Tommy Osbbor who entered his
[1:56:55] ministry. He was a Pentecostal preacher,
[1:56:57] but he saw Brother Brandham in Portland,
[1:56:59] Oregon,
[1:57:01] and changed his life forever.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Now, this is what he says. And I have I
[1:57:05] have to impress you that I believe that
[1:57:08] when a man is speaking, if I were given
[1:57:11] that charge to speak
[1:57:14] at a memorial to this kind of a prophet
[1:57:17] of God, I would really be weighing my
[1:57:20] words out knowing I have to give answer
[1:57:22] to God what I'm saying concerning this
[1:57:25] man.
[1:57:27] He says, I will read from John 10:30-36.
[1:57:30] I won't read it all. I and my father are
[1:57:33] one. Then the Jews took up stones again
[1:57:36] to stone him. Jesus answered them, "Many
[1:57:39] good works have I showed you from my
[1:57:40] father. For which of these works do you
[1:57:42] stone me?" The Jews answered him, "For a
[1:57:45] good work we stone thee not, but for
[1:57:47] blasphemy because thou being a man
[1:57:49] makest thyself God?" And then Jesus
[1:57:52] answered, "Is it not written in your
[1:57:54] law? Ye are gods? If you called them
[1:57:56] gods under whom the word of God came to
[1:57:58] and the scripture cannot be broken, say
[1:58:00] of him whom the father hath sanctified
[1:58:02] and sent into the world, thou blasphemst
[1:58:05] because I said I'm the son of God. And
[1:58:07] then these words, brother Brandham read
[1:58:09] them so often. If I do not the works of
[1:58:12] my father, believe me not. But if I do,
[1:58:15] though you believe me not, believe the
[1:58:17] works that ye may know and believe that
[1:58:20] the father is in me and I in him. Please
[1:58:23] catch the theme. And when I think Tommy
[1:58:26] Osburn says it would be appropriate if
[1:58:28] we could read 1 Corinthians 1:26. For
[1:58:31] you see your calling, brethren, how
[1:58:33] there not many wise men after the flesh,
[1:58:35] and not many mighty. Not many noble are
[1:58:38] called, but God hath chosen the foolish
[1:58:39] things of the world to confound the
[1:58:41] wise. And God hath chosen the weak
[1:58:43] things of the world to confound the
[1:58:45] things which are mighty. And base things
[1:58:47] of the world which are despised have God
[1:58:50] chosen. Yay. and things which are not to
[1:58:53] bring to not the things that are, that
[1:58:55] no flesh should glory in his presence.
[1:58:57] And the next chapter, for I determine
[1:59:00] not to know anything among you, save
[1:59:02] Jesus Christ and him crucified. And I
[1:59:05] was with you in weaknesses and in fear
[1:59:07] and in much trembling. And my speech and
[1:59:10] my preaching was not with enticing words
[1:59:12] of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of
[1:59:15] the spirit and power, that your faith
[1:59:18] should not stand in the wisdom of men,
[1:59:19] but in the power of God. He ceases the
[1:59:22] scripture reading. He said, "One has
[1:59:24] written,
[1:59:26] there's a wind that blows, full of grace
[1:59:28] and power, and in creation's most
[1:59:31] wondrous hour, when God gently breathed
[1:59:35] on a form of sod, the first man lived by
[1:59:40] the breath of God." He said, "The wind
[1:59:42] is a symbol of God, the Holy Spirit. It
[1:59:45] blew across the face of the deep when
[1:59:47] the earth was yet without form and void.
[1:59:49] It blew across the Red Sea and opened up
[1:59:52] a path of deliverance for the people who
[1:59:54] believed. It came as a sound of a
[1:59:56] rushing mighty wind on the day of
[1:59:59] Pentecost when God came to become one
[2:00:01] with man. And it has blown across the
[2:00:04] face of this our generation, a fresh
[2:00:07] breath of God in this 20th century
[2:00:10] through the extraordinary ministry of
[2:00:12] God's prophet to this age. The man
[2:00:15] recognized among men by the name of
[2:00:17] William Brham. This little man because
[2:00:20] of the gift of God for ordained in his
[2:00:23] life lived and ministered completely
[2:00:26] interpenetrated with heaven and earth
[2:00:30] transcending both the seen and the
[2:00:32] unseen worlds. At the same time he
[2:00:35] couldn't help it and he couldn't avoid
[2:00:38] it. One of his closest friends wrote
[2:00:40] these words as he endeavored to describe
[2:00:43] his first Brandham campaign that he had
[2:00:46] attended.
[2:00:48] Quote,
[2:00:50] "We were privileged to keep only five
[2:00:52] glorious days and nights of this
[2:00:55] celestial vigil,
[2:00:57] but the effect of those memorable days
[2:01:00] lives on today." The people were left
[2:01:02] humbled and tendered because they knew
[2:01:05] that Jesus of Nazareth had passed our
[2:01:08] way in his servant. For that holy pause,
[2:01:12] we had seemingly turned back the pages
[2:01:14] of time and joined the admiring host of
[2:01:17] followers that shuffled along the dusty
[2:01:20] trails of Galilee in faithful devotion
[2:01:23] to the lowly carpenter who claimed to be
[2:01:26] the Messiah of Israel. In our visionary
[2:01:29] procession, we had passed by the place
[2:01:31] of the tombs, which erupted a naked
[2:01:34] demonic demoniac, screaming and hissing
[2:01:38] his objection to the presence of Christ,
[2:01:40] but sat at his feet a moment later,
[2:01:43] clothed and in his right mind. We were
[2:01:46] among the jostling mob around Jesus when
[2:01:50] he asked the abrupt question, "Who
[2:01:52] touched me?" We saw a trembling little
[2:01:55] woman cast herself at his feet and
[2:01:57] declare before all the people for what
[2:02:00] cause she had pulled at the border of
[2:02:02] his robe and how she had been healed
[2:02:05] immediately. And then we followed on to
[2:02:08] Gyrus's house and saw the raising of his
[2:02:11] daughter. We heard the plain words of a
[2:02:13] deaf and dumb child after his tongue was
[2:02:16] loosed
[2:02:18] by the master's touch and laughed to see
[2:02:21] the lame man leap for joy. We clamorred
[2:02:25] for a seaside seat with 5,000 other men
[2:02:29] who had forsaken the anvil and hammer
[2:02:32] and closed the doors of their shop to
[2:02:34] spend the day hours in wrapped listening
[2:02:37] to the wonderful teachings of the divine
[2:02:39] philosopher. We wept with the women as
[2:02:42] we gazed on his beautiful face and
[2:02:45] recognized the sorrow and grief that
[2:02:48] spoke of a broken heart and felt the
[2:02:50] melting charming sensation at that one
[2:02:54] glance from his kind eyes could bring to
[2:02:56] the soul. Yes, Bible days were here
[2:03:00] again. Here was a man who practiced what
[2:03:04] he preached. He said, 'I say this, Tommy
[2:03:08] Osbbor goes on, not to exalt any human,
[2:03:11] but to only emphasize that our deep
[2:03:14] appreciation for our brothers stemmed
[2:03:16] from the fact that his ministry seemed
[2:03:18] to bring us bring our lover Lord closer
[2:03:21] to us and to better acquaint us with his
[2:03:24] living works, his personality, and his
[2:03:27] deity than anything had before. It was
[2:03:30] on April morning in 1909 that William
[2:03:33] Brandon was born in a little log cabin
[2:03:35] for ordained of God to minister to this
[2:03:37] generation to cross my path and most of
[2:03:41] yours. When the prophet of God crosses
[2:03:44] your path, oh God grant that you don't
[2:03:47] miss the day of your visitation. How I
[2:03:50] thank God, he said. I wish I could cry
[2:03:52] and talk, but how I thank God. Forgive
[2:03:55] me. To those who perhaps have not
[2:03:57] perceived or known the day in which we
[2:04:00] live. I know this sounds ridiculous, but
[2:04:03] to we who know we can not shake the
[2:04:06] seriousness of this hour. God has chosen
[2:04:10] diverse and mysterious ways to reveal
[2:04:13] himself to his servants, especially
[2:04:15] those called for dispensational
[2:04:18] purposes. as brother Brandham was called
[2:04:20] to Moses he appeared in a burning bush
[2:04:23] to the children of Israel in a pillar of
[2:04:25] fire to Samuel by a voice in the night
[2:04:28] to Elijah with a still small voice and
[2:04:31] other ways to Abraham in a human form to
[2:04:34] Paul John and others in his resurrected
[2:04:37] glory frequently he appeared by
[2:04:39] supernatural visitations of angels
[2:04:41] frequently to Abraham to Moses and to
[2:04:43] Joshua to Gideon to David to the
[2:04:46] prophets to Zachchariah to the shepherds
[2:04:48] and to the apostles. It certainly would
[2:04:50] not be strange then that in this way he
[2:04:53] appeared to brother Brandham. The angel
[2:04:56] of God spoke to him and said, "Fear not.
[2:04:59] I am sent from the presence of Almighty
[2:05:01] God to tell you that your peculiar life
[2:05:04] and misunderstood ways have been to
[2:05:06] indicate that God has sent you to take a
[2:05:09] gift of divine healing to the peoples of
[2:05:11] the world. If you will be sincere and
[2:05:15] can get the people to believe you,
[2:05:16] nothing shall stand before your prayer,
[2:05:18] not even cancer. He was also told, among
[2:05:21] many other things, that his gift was a
[2:05:24] sign of the nearness of the coming of
[2:05:26] the Lord. And through it, God would call
[2:05:29] his people together in the unity of his
[2:05:32] spirit. You hear what he's saying?
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; That this gift was a sign of the
[2:05:39] nearness of the coming of the Lord. And
[2:05:41] through it,
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; God would call his people together in
[2:05:47] the unity of his spirit. In short, the
[2:05:51] man we know as William Brandon was sent
[2:05:53] to demonstrate God again in the flesh.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; But why was he sent to do so? And why
[2:06:00] all of these signs? Had not Jesus
[2:06:02] already done these things? Have they not
[2:06:04] already been written and recorded? Yes,
[2:06:06] absolutely. They had all been done
[2:06:08] before. and men had forgotten them.
[2:06:13] So God willing,
[2:06:15] more abundantly to show the immutability
[2:06:18] of his counsel did it again in the 20th
[2:06:22] century. He did it again and I beheld
[2:06:25] his glory. He could have done it in the
[2:06:27] 18th century, but he did it while I was
[2:06:30] here. So this is the purpose of me being
[2:06:33] here, of our being here. This is the
[2:06:35] purpose of recounting these things. I've
[2:06:37] just said a few things, but now I must
[2:06:39] bring you face to face to face the full
[2:06:42] charge that I, as a servant of the Lord,
[2:06:45] believe that God would have you to face
[2:06:47] tonight. You whom he fore ordained to be
[2:06:50] in this meeting and hear these things
[2:06:53] for you are not here by chance. I pray
[2:06:56] God tonight that the words can be said
[2:06:58] that will show you a little bit more the
[2:07:01] purpose of what we witnessed and see how
[2:07:03] it would affect us now that the man of
[2:07:06] God has gone on. Go back to the
[2:07:09] beginning when God created man. He
[2:07:12] created him as a God man. Notice how
[2:07:14] he's starting.
[2:07:16] Go back to the beginning when God
[2:07:18] created man. He created him to be a God
[2:07:21] man to walk, talk, think, and be like
[2:07:24] God. He breathed into him his very life,
[2:07:27] his breath, God himself. Then the fall
[2:07:30] came, sin, the separation, the spoiled
[2:07:33] plan, the broken fellowship, and the
[2:07:35] tearing apart of what God had planned.
[2:07:37] But but then came the love story, the
[2:07:40] redemption story. And it was no longer
[2:07:42] the forgiveness but now the remission of
[2:07:44] sins. The sunship and the new creation
[2:07:48] came about by so perfect a sacrifice and
[2:07:50] so perfect a word that man once again
[2:07:53] through the act of God was transformed
[2:07:56] and put back in a in a capacity once
[2:07:59] again to be a God man.
[2:08:02] First he showed us how this would be.
[2:08:04] This idea of God and man being one uh
[2:08:08] had been lost. The concept was lost when
[2:08:11] man went out of the went out of the
[2:08:12] garden. They forgot about it and never
[2:08:14] thought about it. Even the old prophets
[2:08:16] consciously never thought never thought
[2:08:19] of it. They didn't perceive it under the
[2:08:21] divine inspiration. They foretold these
[2:08:24] things. But in their human conscience,
[2:08:26] they never thought of this sunship, this
[2:08:29] remission, this total redemption, this
[2:08:32] restoration that was to come. They never
[2:08:35] even thought of it. Nobody ever called
[2:08:37] God his father. It would have been the
[2:08:39] most sacriiggious thing they had ever
[2:08:41] done. So much of uh so much so that they
[2:08:44] wanted to kill Jesus when he did it.
[2:08:47] This is the new language that no one
[2:08:49] could ever conceive. Then of course the
[2:08:52] crucifixion fulfilled the prophets. But
[2:08:54] then this wind, this spirit, this
[2:08:57] presence, this God in spirit form blew
[2:09:00] in that room as the sound of a rushing
[2:09:02] mighty wind and little pillars of fire
[2:09:05] sat on everyone just like at sat in the
[2:09:07] camp of Israel just like it blazed in
[2:09:09] the bush. This wind blew and they became
[2:09:12] God's people, a new creation for the
[2:09:14] first time. It was never known before.
[2:09:17] They became a new creation, divine
[2:09:19] species, God men, God dwelt. Then the
[2:09:23] end began to draw near and the last days
[2:09:27] began to come upon us. A bit of light
[2:09:30] then began to come through. A bit more
[2:09:34] and a bit more until a few years ago we
[2:09:37] were nearing the end of the cycle of
[2:09:39] another 2,000 years which is the final
[2:09:42] one. So that the day of the Lord is at
[2:09:44] hand. This was the closing generation.
[2:09:47] Something had to happen. It couldn't go
[2:09:49] as the past generation had gone. This
[2:09:52] one is it. Therefore, in God's divine
[2:09:56] mercy, somehow stepping beyond the
[2:09:58] bounds of ordinary measure, he had fore
[2:10:02] ordained at this hour to send us again
[2:10:05] this prophet. Some are going to think
[2:10:07] I'm sacriiggious or off doctrinally, and
[2:10:10] it doesn't really matter. But God came
[2:10:13] again in human flesh
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; and said, "Apparently, I must show them
[2:10:18] again. I must remind them again. They
[2:10:22] must see one more time. Once again, they
[2:10:24] must know what God is like. And he
[2:10:27] stepped down and sent a little man, a
[2:10:30] prophet, but more than a prophet this
[2:10:32] time, a Jesus man this time. Elijah was
[2:10:36] not that. This is more than that which
[2:10:39] we have beheld. Moses was not that. For
[2:10:42] because the different dispensation which
[2:10:44] he lived, it couldn't be what we have
[2:10:46] seen more than that. A Jesus man, a man
[2:10:50] full of God, but sent as a special sign
[2:10:54] to a generation, this generation, a
[2:10:58] supernatural sign, an extraordinary
[2:11:00] measure. Amen.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; Said this halo of light that appeared at
[2:11:08] his birth, the star, the angel, the
[2:11:09] discernment, the gifts, all of these
[2:11:12] were given for that one purpose to show
[2:11:15] to show us God again.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; This was William Brandham's life. I'm
[2:11:26] missing out much of it. This was William
[2:11:28] Brandham's life precisely as we read it
[2:11:30] in the scripture. Then here brother
[2:11:33] Brandham say this and they say it's
[2:11:36] wrong today. But it isn't. They don't
[2:11:39] believe it. They wouldn't have believed
[2:11:41] it then. But God has come again. Crossed
[2:11:45] our paths again. Showed us again what
[2:11:48] God a God man is like. What God is like.
[2:11:52] what he is like in in the flesh and what
[2:11:55] the new creation is like. Is this a
[2:11:57] mystery?
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; This is not a mystery. This is the
[2:12:01] wonder of God.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Is this a matter of of dick to dicker
[2:12:05] over doctrally? This is a matter to g
[2:12:08] give glory to our God who has come in
[2:12:11] the flesh again in our generation. He's
[2:12:13] come in the flesh in all of us, but in a
[2:12:16] particular way in this man who was his
[2:12:18] prophet for this generation. Listen
[2:12:23] friends,
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; they did recognize it.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; And these were leaders, great leaders
[2:12:31] that were gathered in this meeting.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; This is what they believed. What they
[2:12:37] saw and what they agreed with was the
[2:12:40] priest lamb.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; They got that far. They could see the
[2:12:46] lamb priesthood
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; and they loved it. And they never saw
[2:12:51] anything like that. And they had to
[2:12:53] agree this is a Jesus man.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; This is God in flesh. Said it over and
[2:12:58] over again more than we say it.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; He said it
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; to in this generation went beyond the
[2:13:05] bounds of what should be necessary to
[2:13:08] shake the people out of that Pentecostal
[2:13:11] doctrine. And many of them trinitarians.
[2:13:14] And now they say this is a prophet. This
[2:13:17] is a sign. This is a sign of his coming.
[2:13:19] And through this sign, he's going to
[2:13:20] gather a people. I wouldn't be a bit
[2:13:23] surprised God made him say it.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; And here we are today, a product of it.
[2:13:31] But we're not here just for the
[2:13:33] priesthood. We're not here just for the
[2:13:35] mercy part. We're not here just for
[2:13:38] that. But we're here because the king,
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, was introduced through this
[2:13:43] ministry. the king. Hallelujah. And
[2:13:47] he'll be son of David to the Jews. We
[2:13:49] are here just in this little space of
[2:13:51] time from the time of the revealing to
[2:13:54] the time of the fulfillment of the
[2:13:56] seals. Here we are right in the middle
[2:13:58] of it. And when we read it, sometime we
[2:14:00] say, "Oh my goodness, has that already
[2:14:01] happened?" Well, we're It looks like
[2:14:03] something to happen. Looks like it has
[2:14:05] happened. I can tell you it is
[2:14:07] happening.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; You're right in the middle of this
[2:14:10] happening. And this is a glorious
[2:14:12] happening. And if that man can say that,
[2:14:14] surely I can say his this this message
[2:14:18] came to call an elect, and that elect
[2:14:20] has been called and is being called, and
[2:14:23] I'm glad to be a part of it. I rejoice
[2:14:26] in what God has done.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Are you thrilled to be identified with
[2:14:30] it?
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Forget about Cloverdale Bible Way.
[2:14:33] Forget about the church. Forget about
[2:14:34] that. We've been called by the
[2:14:36] bridegroom's voice.
[2:14:38] And I heard his cry. Amen. and I came
[2:14:42] out to him and we've been united in
[2:14:45] marriage to this glorious one.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, he still heals. He still
[2:14:51] delivers the demoniac.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; He still casts out. He still raises the
[2:14:57] dead.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; He still does these mighty things. But
[2:15:00] more than that, we have been wed to him
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; and his seed has been placed in us. And
[2:15:07] we He is the word and we are the word.
[2:15:10] Hallelujah. We're the last voice to this
[2:15:13] generation.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; People say that's a lot to say. You must
[2:15:20] think a lot of yourself. The same spirit
[2:15:22] that was in Christ that would say if you
[2:15:25] don't hear this, you remain in your sin.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; That's exactly. You remain in your
[2:15:31] unbelief because this is a vindicated
[2:15:33] word. God has confirmed this word.
[2:15:36] Hallelujah. Not just with signs and
[2:15:38] wonders. He He confirmed it out of the
[2:15:40] scriptures.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; There's no message that unfolds the
[2:15:44] scriptures like this.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; Well, that's as far as I could get
[2:15:53] the converging of those offices and it's
[2:15:56] really marvelous.
[2:16:01] I'm thrilled.
[2:16:03] Thank you for your patience and your
[2:16:05] time. Time has slipped away from us.
[2:16:08] But I'm just going to thank him if you
[2:16:11] would please.
[2:16:12] It's It's amazing what
[2:16:16] I'm sure you're quite surprised to hear
[2:16:18] what men have said.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; Are you not?
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Incredible.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; Let us not take these things lightly.
[2:16:29] Oh, Father God,
[2:16:32] you are indeed the God of Abraham, the
[2:16:34] God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.
[2:16:37] You are the God of the prophets, the God
[2:16:39] of the kings,
[2:16:41] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[2:16:43] Christ who raised him from the dead.
[2:16:47] You are the one that came and stood by
[2:16:49] the messenger, the prophet messenger of
[2:16:51] this day.
[2:16:53] We know that that was you speaking. You
[2:16:56] have come and unveiled your word.
[2:16:59] How thankful we are. We don't have to
[2:17:00] sit in darkness anymore.
[2:17:03] We don't have to be Gentiles sitting in
[2:17:05] darkness, but we are Gentiles that sat
[2:17:06] in darkness that saw a great light
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; and we have risen to this light. Oh, I
[2:17:13] thank you for the light of your go
[2:17:14] glorious gospel. Father, somehow I pray
[2:17:18] you'll inspire this congregation.
[2:17:20] Inspire this people. Give them a divine
[2:17:23] a divine uncction. Give them an
[2:17:26] illumination in their minds. I've tried
[2:17:28] to make it as clear as I could this
[2:17:30] morning. Lord, I pray that you'll take
[2:17:31] it and nail those things down in the
[2:17:33] heart. Even let the unbelieving heart
[2:17:35] right now, oh God, I pray they'll be
[2:17:37] loose to their unbelief.
[2:17:39] They might say, "Oh God, my father, I
[2:17:43] believe, cast away this doubt from my
[2:17:46] mind. I pray you'll give all of our
[2:17:48] precious young people, give them a
[2:17:50] stalwart walk with you. I pray, Father,
[2:17:53] that you will give them such such a an
[2:17:56] inspiration, Lord. when they go to
[2:17:59] school, we we pray that they will do
[2:18:01] well. How much more we pray that they
[2:18:04] will grasp your word and the depth of
[2:18:06] it. Oh God, grant it in the name of
[2:18:08] Jesus Christ. We ask it for your glory.
[2:18:12] Refresh us, Lord, as we will soon return
[2:18:15] for the Lord's table this night in Jesus
[2:18:18] name. Amen.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll stand and I want to sing.
[2:18:23] It's manifesting time.
[2:18:29] It's manifesting time, friends.
[2:18:33] From the time of the revealing to the
[2:18:36] time of the fulfillment.
[2:18:38] Were you able to receive this morning?
[2:18:40] Something for you to take and chew on. I
[2:18:43] trust that it really is. I trust that it
[2:18:45] is.
[2:18:47] Here it is. The voice of my beloved.
[2:18:51] The voice of my beloved.
[2:18:55] Behold, he quickly comes sweeping over
[2:18:59] the mountains, over the hills he
[2:19:03] [Music]
[2:19:10] say.
[2:19:19] It's manesting time.
[2:19:22] The fruit on the
[2:19:26] wall
[2:19:27] is coming
[2:19:30] [Music]
[2:19:36] anient.
[2:19:44] We sing the third verse. Plays the third
[2:19:46] verse. In the cliff of the rock, in the
[2:19:51] secret place,
[2:19:54] till the day breaks
[2:19:57] away
[2:19:59] [Music]
[2:20:01] in that mountain place.
[2:20:04] [Music]
[2:20:11] Thank you.
[2:20:12] [Music]
[2:20:13] Oh, it's
[2:20:16] time
[2:20:22] is coming in.
[2:20:33] [Music]
[2:20:34] My lovely one is coming in.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; Now, for those of you that had
[2:20:44] opportunity to read the first seal, I I
[2:20:48] have to tell you, I've read the first
[2:20:50] half of the first seal uh a multitude of
[2:20:53] times in the last 10 days, and I haven't
[2:20:56] even got to the backhand yet. I've read
[2:20:58] it. I've read it, of course, many times
[2:21:00] before, but I just felt to really
[2:21:04] go slowly. And I believe God has some
[2:21:06] things in it for us. And quite frankly,
[2:21:10] I know that even this morning throughout
[2:21:12] the congregation, I had that witness
[2:21:15] before I came to the pullpit. There's
[2:21:17] going to be some questions that you've
[2:21:19] had that have been answered.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; You had some questions about it. So,
[2:21:25] that's why I took in the service. I
[2:21:27] thought I would raise the question first
[2:21:30] and then come back in and show the
[2:21:33] scriptural pattern
[2:21:35] that it happened with Abraham. It
[2:21:37] happened with Moses, happened in Jesus'
[2:21:39] time. And so the real key here for it
[2:21:42] all is from the time of the revealing
[2:21:45] which it has been revealed to the time
[2:21:47] of the fulfillment. and he had to say
[2:21:50] what it was in the revealing,
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; but not necessarily that it was all
[2:21:56] over. But when it was spoken, you can be
[2:22:00] certain it was initiated.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; And I can say to you on the authority of
[2:22:05] God's word, we're right smack in the
[2:22:07] middle of it.
[2:22:09] And I don't know about you, but I love
[2:22:11] to be in the middle of things,
[2:22:13] especially when God's doing it.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nice to have our brother Ernie
[2:22:18] here. I'm going to ask brother Ernie to
[2:22:20] come and dismiss us in prayer and and
[2:22:22] then deacons, please have these surveys
[2:22:25] ready, please at the door. I want
[2:22:27] everyone 18 and over to take one,
[2:22:29] please. And u uh don't leave it at home.
[2:22:32] Bring it back this evening if you would
[2:22:34] just deposit it there. Uh and come with
[2:22:38] your hearts all ready. We only have a
[2:22:39] little time to get refreshed now and get
[2:22:41] rested and be back here at 5:00. Brother
[2:22:44] Ernie, God bless you. Nice to have you
[2:22:46] again. God bless you.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[2:22:50] [Music]
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; Father, we can as a group say that we
[2:22:55] are so thankful that the spirit of truth
[2:22:57] has come in this day.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; And Lord, you have revealed yourself to
[2:23:03] a body of believers. You have offered to
[2:23:06] them a justification, a sanctification,
[2:23:10] a revelation of your spirit and an
[2:23:13] infilling of your spirit, Lord, that
[2:23:15] would lift us up into realms and
[2:23:17] dimensions and spheres that no other
[2:23:20] people who have ever walked the earth
[2:23:22] have had that privilege. Lord, you've
[2:23:24] called us. You proposed to us. You've
[2:23:27] asked us to be your bride, oh God. And
[2:23:29] we have responded, Lord, that we will
[2:23:31] take that wedding band of unmmerited
[2:23:34] grace, Lord. We'll be faithful. We'll be
[2:23:36] true, Lord, in all of our dealings,
[2:23:39] Lord. Lord, we want to love you in ways,
[2:23:42] Lord, that we don't even know how to,
[2:23:44] Father. But Lord, you will show us. You
[2:23:46] will lead and guide us and direct us,
[2:23:48] Lord, into further truth, into more
[2:23:51] revelation, into a depth, Lord, into a
[2:23:54] sweetness of revelation of truth,
[2:23:56] Father, that will satisfy our soul,
[2:23:59] Lord. Lord, I pray that each one of us,
[2:24:01] Lord, would be able to shine the light
[2:24:04] of God in this darkened world, Lord, to
[2:24:07] others, Father, who may be out there
[2:24:09] looking, who may be sincere seekers, oh
[2:24:12] God, may be trapped in a system, but
[2:24:15] Lord, lead us and guide us and direct
[2:24:17] us, Lord, to those that you would have
[2:24:19] us witness to, Father. And Lord, we pray
[2:24:21] for Brother Ed that you would restore
[2:24:23] his strength and his energy, Lord. We
[2:24:26] thank you for the insight into the word
[2:24:28] that you have given to him, Lord, that
[2:24:30] he may pass on to us, Father. And Lord,
[2:24:32] we pray for the service tonight, that we
[2:24:34] would come ready and and and and and be
[2:24:37] in anticipation and expectation, Lord,
[2:24:40] of this great time together, the Lord's
[2:24:42] supper and footwashing. Father, we thank
[2:24:45] you for this day. We thank you for what
[2:24:47] you've done in this service, Father, in
[2:24:49] your precious name of our Lord Jesus
[2:24:51] Christ. Amen.
[2:24:55] God bless you each one. Greet one
[2:24:58] another and we'll look forward to seeing
[2:25:00] you this evening. You're dismissed. God
[2:25:02] bless you.
[2:25:05] [Music]
[2:25:20] Love my Cric.
