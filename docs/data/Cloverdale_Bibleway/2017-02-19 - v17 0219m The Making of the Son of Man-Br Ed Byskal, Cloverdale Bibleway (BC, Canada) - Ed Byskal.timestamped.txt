[5:17] sing. I know the master of the wind.
[5:18] I've been in my boat of life.

[5:32] sails on a troubled sea.

[6:18] We can call the storm to make the sun to
[6:22] shine again. Yes, I know I know the
[6:28] master of the
[6:31] Amen. Sometimes I saw
[6:34] sometimes I saw light
[6:38] in the sky
[6:41] among the peace my soul can be found
[6:49] but an unexpected stor
[6:52] may drive me high but
[6:57] it may bring me low it can never bring
[7:00] me

[7:21] Yes, he can calm the storm and make the
[7:25] sun to shine again. Yes, I know. I know
[7:31] the master of the world.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that second verse again.
[7:35] Sometimes I s
[7:39] [Music]
[7:40] like an eagle in the sky
[7:45] among the peace of my soul.
[7:50] [Music]
[7:53] An unexpected storm.

[11:14] [Music]
[11:17] is more than I see

[11:27] something.
[11:28] [Music]
[11:37] &gt;&gt; Let's stand and receive verse four.
[11:39] Every is handing
[11:49] and

[13:18] eyes I see.
[13:20] [Music]
[13:24] He came to me.
[13:30] He came
[13:33] to me. For some things this morning,
[13:35] saints, we lift our arms and worship
[13:37] him. But I could not come to where he
[13:40] was.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; He came to
[13:45] bless your name. Lord Jesus, that's why
[13:48] you died. That's why he died.
[13:55] on Calary
[13:57] [Music]
[14:02] when I could not come
[14:06] to where he was. He came
[14:10] to me.
[14:14] He came
[14:16] to me. Hallelujah.
[14:20] For you came
[14:23] to me
[14:24] [Music]
[14:26] when I could not come
[14:30] to where he was.
[14:33] He gave to me
[14:39] and that's why he died.
[14:43] [Music]
[14:45] Watch
[14:47] me
[14:51] when I could not come
[14:55] to where he was. He came to me just once
[15:01] more. where he came to. Oh, thank you
[15:04] Lord to me.
[15:08] He came
[15:11] to me
[15:15] when I could not come
[15:19] to where he was.
[15:22] He came
[15:24] to me
[15:27] and that's why he died.
[15:31] [Music]
[15:33] on Calary.
[15:35] [Music]
[15:39] When I could not come
[15:43] to where he was, he came to me.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be your name, Lord. Amen.
[15:54] It's because of that, saints. So, now we
[15:55] have a right to come before him through
[15:57] the blood of Calvary. What a privilege.
[16:01] It might be the only right we can
[16:03] exercise is based on what he's done for
[16:05] us to come before him as children. Amen.
[16:08] Through the blood of the lamb. Amen.
[16:09] We're going to go to prayer at this
[16:11] time. Amen. Brother Darren Hoffman, can
[16:13] I ask you to come please if you wouldn't
[16:15] mind and open the service for us in a
[16:16] word of prayer. Floren family is just
[16:19] asking we please remember brother Roy
[16:20] who's home not well asking for a healing
[16:23] touch for him. And also our sister Patty
[16:26] Pettingale is asking for healing. She's
[16:28] having medical problems.
[16:30] Our sister Violet Law is asking for
[16:32] prayer for her sister Rosemary who has
[16:34] had some tests done and they're just
[16:35] asking that the tests would all come
[16:37] back positive, that everything is
[16:39] working in her favor and she will not
[16:41] have to have an operation. Amen. Let's
[16:44] remember our sister Violet sister. If
[16:46] there's something on your heart that you
[16:47] just like to lift before the Lord and we
[16:49] can come before him this morning through
[16:50] the blood of the lamb knowing that he's
[16:52] already made a way for us. All right.
[16:54] So, let's exercise our right this
[16:56] morning as sons and daughters of God.
[16:58] Amen. And ask for what you have need of
[17:00] this morning. Brother Darren, come
[17:01] please. Thank you.
[17:04] [Music]
[17:08] Let's bow our heads.
[17:11] [Music]
[17:14] Heavenly Father, we are so thankful this
[17:17] morning, Lord.
[17:20] Father, we're thankful for the
[17:21] revelation of Jesus Christ that you have
[17:23] given to each one of us, Lord.
[17:26] Lord, so many precious promises that you
[17:28] have placed in your word for us. So many
[17:32] treasures, dear God. So many promises of
[17:35] healing, Lord. He promises of salvation.
[17:39] Heavenly Father, you have given us, Lord
[17:41] Jesus. We're a blessed people, Lord. And
[17:45] father, thinking of how that
[17:48] when Moses met you, Lord, how that you
[17:51] spoke to him and said you were merciful
[17:53] and gracious and how he he acted upon
[17:56] it, Father. He stood in their breach,
[17:58] Lord. He prayed for the Israel, Lord. He
[18:00] besought you, Lord God, to be merciful
[18:03] unto them, to be gracious unto them and
[18:04] to lead them into that promised land.
[18:08] Lord, this morning we go through many
[18:10] trials and many struggles, dear God, but
[18:13] Lord, we're asking the same thing. Lord,
[18:14] lead us to that promised land. Lead our
[18:16] children, lead our loved ones, dear God.
[18:19] Heavenly Father, we we want to walk in
[18:21] the promises of God. They're yay and
[18:23] amen to them that believe. We don't want
[18:25] to be hearers only, Lord, but we want to
[18:27] hear the word. We want to recognize that
[18:30] is God speaking to us through the
[18:31] vessel. God unveiled in a man. God
[18:35] unveiled in a people. Lord Jesus, would
[18:38] you so speak to us today, Lord, through
[18:40] your servant, Lord? It just takes one
[18:42] word, Father. It just takes a moment,
[18:44] dear God, for that word to touch our
[18:46] hearts, to transform us, Lord, to change
[18:49] situations, to change lives, to raise up
[18:52] those that are sick and bodied, Lord.
[18:54] those that are downcast, those that are
[18:56] troubled in their spirits, Lord. Those
[18:58] that are are possessed, Lord, those that
[19:00] are oppressed by the enemy, Father, it
[19:03] is but one word, dear God, if we can
[19:05] just act upon it, recognizing that is
[19:07] Jesus Christ, the word that has been
[19:09] brought to us today, Lord, through your
[19:11] servant, Lord, our prophet, William
[19:13] Brham. We're so thankful, Lord, for a
[19:15] message of deliverance, a message that's
[19:17] real, Lord. Father, not just vain words.
[19:20] is not a dead letter, Father, but it's a
[19:22] living word, a living reality, Lord,
[19:25] Lord, that just beating within our
[19:26] hearts, Lord, for Father. So would you
[19:29] today, Lord, would you come and meet
[19:31] with us, Lord? We're wanting a greater
[19:34] portion. We want, Lord, a greater desire
[19:36] in our lives to serve you, Lord. So many
[19:39] distractions, Lord God, that the enemy
[19:42] puts before us. But there's an
[19:44] attraction on the mountain, Lord, that
[19:45] we want to behold today, Lord. Father,
[19:48] we came today to behold your glory to
[19:51] receive of you, Father. That this word
[19:53] would be quickened in each one of us
[19:55] today. Lord, we just ask for these
[19:57] prayer requests, Lord. These ones that
[19:59] need a touch in their body, Lord Jesus,
[20:01] by your stripes, Lord, they're already
[20:04] healed. You're the Lord God that heals
[20:05] all of our diseases. You've already
[20:07] given us the promises, Lord. May faith
[20:09] rise within our hearts to claim what is
[20:12] already ours, to resist the devil, and
[20:14] he will flee. Lord, we so give you
[20:16] thanksgiving. Father, just asking that
[20:18] you'll bless the remainder of the
[20:20] service. Lord, just as we just are led
[20:22] by Brother Ryan through the singing and
[20:24] through the worship, Lord, we just want
[20:26] our hearts prepared now to receive you,
[20:29] Lord Jesus. Have your way with us. Bless
[20:31] the offering. Bless those that can give.
[20:34] Father, may you multiply it. Use it for
[20:36] your glory, Father. Lord Jesus, we give
[20:38] you thanksgiving now and praise you for
[20:40] all things in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[20:44] [Music]
[20:46] Praise the Lord.
[20:48] Amen. God bless you. You may have your
[20:50] seats. We take up the offering. Maybe we
[20:52] could just sing. There is none like you.
[20:54] No one else can touch my heart like you
[20:56] do. Amen. He's so worthy. I just want to
[20:58] give him thanks this morning. I just
[21:00] feel such a a welcome atmosphere already
[21:03] this morning. And I'm so excited to see
[21:05] what God's going to do. Amen. Through
[21:07] the word. So, let's just prepare our
[21:08] hearts. We're going to turn the pulpit
[21:10] to our brother Tom for a moment just
[21:11] before brother Ed comes. But let's sing
[21:13] this chorus a couple times together.
[21:15] There is none like you,
[21:18] &gt;&gt; Lord. There is none like
[21:22] you.
[21:24] No one else
[21:28] &gt;&gt; can touch my heart like you
[21:32] &gt;&gt; the way that you do.
[21:35] And I can search for all eternity,
[21:40] Lord,
[21:42] and find
[21:43] there is none like you.
[21:49] There is none like you.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; There is none like you.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. No one else. No one else can touch
[22:03] my heart like you.
[22:06] &gt;&gt; And I can search.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; I can search for all eternity,
[22:13] Lord,
[22:14] and find that there is none like you.
[22:20] Once more, there's none like you, Lord.
[22:22] There is none.
[22:25] There is no one like you, Lord Jesus.
[22:33] No one else can touch my heart like you
[22:37] do.
[22:40] And I can search for all eternity,
[22:45] Lord,
[22:47] and find
[22:52] you.
[22:56] Amen. God bless you this morning. Nice
[22:58] to see everybody here. Looking forward
[23:01] to a wonderful day in the presence of
[23:03] the Lord. And um I've just got a couple
[23:06] of announcements before the pastor would
[23:08] come out and minister the word of God to
[23:10] us. Uh a couple of things we'd like to
[23:13] say. We're coming up to a camp time and
[23:16] it's a wonderful time
[23:18] and we're having it for our young
[23:20] people. Our camp is for our young
[23:22] people. And sometimes, like any daddy,
[23:25] he wants to have some special time with
[23:27] his own children. And those are times
[23:30] that maybe you get away with your family
[23:31] and you do something special. And you
[23:33] make them special. You make them feel
[23:35] special. And that's what we are having
[23:38] this camp for this winter camp. Brother
[23:40] Craig Bur from Lime, Ohio will be
[23:43] speaking. And I believe it'll be exactly
[23:46] what we have need of, what exactly the
[23:49] parents have been praying for for their
[23:50] young people. I believe God works at
[23:53] both ends. And as we have looked to the
[23:56] Lord over these years, and we have many
[23:58] times, of course, for the special
[24:00] speaker that will come, we just pray
[24:02] that God will anoint brother Craig in a
[24:04] special way. He's looking forward, and
[24:06] we're looking forward to him. So, we
[24:08] want uh as many as can support the camp
[24:13] in your prayers. And that's what we're
[24:15] asking for this morning, that God would
[24:17] move in a sovereign and and special way.
[24:21] And if you take and speak to the young
[24:22] people many times, it will point back to
[24:24] a certain event or a certain service.
[24:28] And I'm sure that that's what you would
[24:29] want for your own special young children
[24:32] in in your own family. So the services
[24:35] will be for the campers for February
[24:38] 23rd, 4th and 5th. Uh the 26th will be
[24:42] on this Sunday and the Sunday is open to
[24:46] all all that can make it across the
[24:48] border. We would invite you to come and
[24:50] it'll be our main service and um it
[24:54] starts at 10:30 10:30 a.m. on the US
[24:58] side. Now, those that are unable, of
[25:00] course, we have a a multicultural
[25:03] um assembly and different ones have
[25:05] maybe challenges in the immigration area
[25:07] and we we understand that. And so, what
[25:10] Brother Bisll, myself, we've been
[25:11] sitting down talking what can we do to
[25:13] make it like a service for you that
[25:15] can't make it across the border. Well,
[25:17] we're going to have the sanctuary open.
[25:20] We're going to stream it on the on the
[25:22] screen behind here. And uh brother I've
[25:24] asked brother Tim Dodd to stay behind to
[25:26] be with you. Brother Joe Waldner has
[25:29] graciously accepted also as a deacon.
[25:31] We'll be here. It will be a service. It
[25:33] will be conducted as a service, but
[25:34] we'll be together. We'll be at Mount
[25:36] Baker Bible Way Camp. You'll be at
[25:38] Cloverdale Bible Way. And I I believe
[25:40] that'll be something special for you.
[25:42] And you can and and you can experience
[25:45] what the Holy Spirit will be ministering
[25:47] to us in a very special way. Um
[25:50] counselors, we'd like you to note that
[25:52] we have a a meeting right away after the
[25:54] service in the chapel. If you could
[25:56] gather for that, that would be
[25:58] wonderful. Right away after the service,
[26:00] uh you may linger as as as the Lord
[26:02] would have you linger, but after God's
[26:04] dealt with you, please um assemble in
[26:07] the in the chapel. One last thing, um we
[26:10] actually spoke a couple of weeks ago
[26:12] that the saints or the young people from
[26:14] China were going to give their Wednesday
[26:16] night experience. Well, Brother Murphy
[26:17] comes in tomorrow night and they've been
[26:21] they've told me that they wanted Brother
[26:23] Murphy to be here for that evening. So,
[26:27] God willing, I've spoken to Brother
[26:28] Murphy last week and Brother Murphy is
[26:31] going to be taking the service Wednesday
[26:32] night with the young people, Brother
[26:33] Kim, and all those that have been in
[26:35] China. I think it'll be a wonderful
[26:37] time. So, God bless you and may this
[26:40] week be a just a wonderful experience.
[26:42] We've been waiting on the Lord for this
[26:44] service this morning. Brother Ed sent a

[26:51] reading in the scripture listening to a
[26:53] tape. I'm looking forward to the
[26:55] presence of God to unveil himself
[26:58] through us this morning. God bless you.
[27:07] And there also will be a meal at the
[27:09] camp for everyone who makes it to the
[27:11] service. Uh so and there's no Sunday
[27:14] school, but lunch will be provided at

[31:46] Love that will glow
[31:49] till others

[31:54] Jesus.
[32:00] And we're going to sing that last verse
[32:01] again as our pastor comes. I want you to
[32:04] sing it like the confession that it is.
[32:06] Triumph and peace is mine now. Jesus
[32:09] reigns within. Hallelujah. He giveth joy
[32:12] divine and victory over sin. So let's

[35:54] I cannot.
[35:57] [Music]
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Wonderful to see everyone here this
[36:13] morning and uh
[36:17] we're just in expectation, are we not?
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for receiving the note
[36:23] yesterday and thank you Matthew for
[36:27] Matthew Adell sending it out. He said
[36:28] that's the first time that that's been
[36:31] requested. So that's right. It was the
[36:34] first time we requested it from the
[36:36] office and I'm glad I'm sure that none
[36:39] of you who have read the message the
[36:42] unveiling of God have regretted that.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know it's a just a wonderful
[36:46] message and thank you brother
[36:51] Hayes, brother Jim Hayes and Sister Joy.
[36:54] Thank you for being present today and
[36:57] for the note also. they received the
[37:00] note and so I'm glad that so many uh
[37:04] participated and were hearing it and so
[37:07] on. I think that there are some things
[37:08] that I've been about uh 3 weeks and I
[37:13] haven't quite got through yet. I've got
[37:16] the last few pages to do which I expect
[37:19] to do today. But uh I've been I just got
[37:23] hung up so many times
[37:25] &gt;&gt; and there's lots to get hung up in.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; So, I want to take my my time today, but
[37:35] I I did want to say thank you to the
[37:39] people that have come and the local
[37:41] congregation because if we didn't have
[37:44] that, uh we wouldn't have much of a
[37:47] ministry to the country or the world or
[37:49] the local congregation. But we're so
[37:53] thankful that God has uh been able to
[37:56] use this place as a lighthouse.
[37:59] And uh to all those that are streaming
[38:02] and brother Timothy Anoco in South
[38:05] Africa uh we're missing you today. Uh I
[38:09] know that the people in Switzerland and
[38:12] Germany and Romania and Croatia and
[38:15] wherever else. It's just wonderful. And
[38:18] we we're more than thankful. We feel it
[38:21] a privilege to be able to be a blessing.
[38:25] And if we can fit someplace in their
[38:28] lives, then we just feel rewarded.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[38:34] I'm going to have you uh stand and read
[38:37] with me and we'll uh we'll start in the
[38:41] scriptures.
[38:44] We're going to read. I want to read John
[38:47] 1 and 14 first.
[38:54] And then we will go immediately to
[38:56] Philippians the 2 chapter
[39:00] starting to read at verse 5
[39:06] in the Philippians.
[39:09] But first John 1 and14.
[39:12] And I'm reading these scriptures
[39:15] specifically to emphasize certain
[39:18] words and certain phrases throughout the
[39:21] service.
[39:24] And the word was made flesh
[39:28] and dwelt among us. And we beheld his
[39:31] glory. The glory is the only begotten of
[39:35] the father full of grace and truth.
[39:39] And I have been pondering very deeply
[39:42] and the word was made
[39:45] flesh. How how was it made?
[39:50] How did it go from the thought and the
[39:52] intent of God to a vis visible man? It's
[39:58] hard sometimes for our human minds to
[40:00] get around that that you know the word
[40:04] was made flesh.
[40:07] So, I've been pondering that and I want
[40:09] to call the service this morning the the
[40:12] message the making of the son of man
[40:16] because when we get uh the concept and
[40:19] the idea and into how God made that then
[40:25] we'll know why he made us
[40:29] why he made and he brought Jesus
[40:33] uh at a certain moment in time he
[40:36] brought him here. He was making him and
[40:40] the prophet says Christ was in Abraham
[40:46] and we know Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and
[40:49] Joseph were the four corners of the
[40:51] masterpiece
[40:53] and he constructed his masterpiece. But
[40:56] these were all humans with flaws
[41:00] &gt;&gt; just like you,
[41:02] &gt;&gt; just like me. We all had flaws.
[41:06] No one was perfect in someone else's
[41:09] eyes
[41:10] &gt;&gt; because the one that was looking wasn't
[41:12] perfect.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; So that's just normal. But so don't
[41:17] expect to see anything perfect cuz you
[41:19] wouldn't know it was perfect if it was
[41:21] perfect.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; We haven't got a perfect judgment to
[41:27] begin with. But the making of the son of
[41:29] man, the son of man was a perfect one.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was the He was the image of the
[41:36] invisible God.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; He was the temple in which God came to
[41:42] dwell in. He was the veil
[41:45] &gt;&gt; for the invisible God.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; And what a high honor he has given to us
[41:51] &gt;&gt; to give a messenger, a prophet messenger
[41:56] with a word. But as Jesus was not even
[42:00] considered by the uh the local people to
[42:04] be a perfect one for they found enough
[42:07] error in him to hang him
[42:09] &gt;&gt; on a cross and to give him a most cruel
[42:12] death
[42:14] &gt;&gt; but death could not conquer him
[42:18] &gt;&gt; because he was beyond corruption by the
[42:21] word of God. His flesh will not see
[42:24] corruption.
[42:25] And death can't take a believer.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Death, who is the penalty of sin, has
[42:33] already been dealt with.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus died the death.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God is trying to tell
[42:41] us something. God is using him. He came
[42:43] at a certain era
[42:47] in history of the world. In fact is this
[42:51] ministry his ministry just began to
[42:54] blossom after the second world war. We
[42:57] call it the second world war. Prophet
[42:59] calls it the second birth pain.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; And we need to talk message language.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; So that just blossomed 194748
[43:11] just after the second birth pain. I
[43:13] wonder if that isn't significant.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Yes it is. And I I was thinking just of
[43:19] my own life and uh we all have we all
[43:23] came but I want you to know today I am
[43:27] ministering to you as as from the depths
[43:30] of my heart that you individually you
[43:33] came when God wanted you on the scene.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; So we're not only talking about the
[43:40] making of the masterpiece Jesus Christ.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the making of you.
[43:46] Amen.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; And I pondered some things today whether
[43:50] I would even say them. But one I've I've
[43:53] learned a few things in life. And one of
[43:56] them is that the the individual humans,
[44:00] we have difficulty.
[44:02] Uh that's why I read the scripture and
[44:05] the word was made flesh. We we rattle
[44:07] that off our lips all the time. But what
[44:09] does that mean? How how was the word?
[44:13] That's what I want to talk about. How
[44:15] was the word made flesh? And there are
[44:18] other things in the scripture I will be
[44:22] dealing with in the message in the of
[44:24] the mercy seat and how drastic changes
[44:29] of the mercy seat and we don't
[44:32] understand that perhaps. So I I wanted I
[44:36] want to dwell especially on the
[44:39] ministry, the prophets ministry
[44:42] coming to us at this time. And this was
[44:45] this wasn't an accident. Your mother and
[44:48] father and your heritage and all that
[44:50] business has nothing to do with that.
[44:53] God simply used them as tools
[44:56] &gt;&gt; to bring you on the scene. He wanted you
[44:58] here now.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; He wanted you to hear a certain thing.
[45:02] He wanted you. He wanted you. He has you
[45:05] ordained to be in this service today. I
[45:08] don't know most all of you or many of
[45:10] you and why you're here and all the rest
[45:12] of it. I can tell you you're not here by
[45:14] an accident.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; You are not here by just your own
[45:18] thought. Well, I think I'll go to church
[45:20] today. That's not it at all. God wanted
[45:22] you here to hear what's going to be
[45:25] spoken.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; And I want you to listen on that basis.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:31] I'm here by design.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh and dwelt
[45:38] among us. And we beheld his glory. We
[45:42] did. And as the glory the glory as of
[45:47] the only begotten of the father, full of
[45:50] grace and truth.
[45:53] And to be made is is to come to pass.
[45:59] To be made is to be done or to to be
[46:02] fulfilled. And that's why Jesus said,
[46:05] "How then?" They want him to escape the
[46:08] suffering. How then will the scriptures
[46:11] be fulfilled?
[46:12] &gt;&gt; That was part of his own making.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; That was there for him. And you know
[46:17] that there's there's a rapture. There's
[46:20] a catching away.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; There's glorious things that are
[46:24] prophesied to happen in this time. And
[46:26] God called you here for that.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; That that's the that that that's the
[46:33] enormity of this thing. That is just un
[46:35] almost unbelievable. God called you here
[46:38] for that. And that is why Satan put such
[46:41] pressure on you to captivate your time,
[46:44] to capture your mind, to occupy you with
[46:48] all kinds of other things. And that's
[46:50] fine. We've got necessary things, but we
[46:53] must keep our focal point. why we're
[46:56] here.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we'll read now in Philippians
[47:00] 2,
[47:02] starting in verse 5.
[47:04] Let this mind be in you which also was
[47:08] in Christ which was also in Christ
[47:12] Jesus. Who being in the form of God
[47:14] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[47:16] God but made himself of no reputation
[47:20] and took upon him the form of a servant
[47:23] and was made in the likeness of man. So
[47:27] we have that again. And he was made in
[47:30] the likeness of man. wasn't easy, wasn't
[47:33] simple.
[47:34] And he and God himself subjected himself
[47:39] and humbled himself, allowed in the
[47:42] character of God, allowed himself to be
[47:44] represented on earth by men who
[47:49] did things that you probably wouldn't
[47:52] respect. But Moses murdered a man and
[47:56] David took Ba Sheba and all of these
[48:00] things and things that you might have
[48:01] remembered for a whole lifetime.
[48:04] Wouldn't it be good for you to remember
[48:05] that?
[48:06] &gt;&gt; It would be good for you to remember
[48:08] that God brought this man
[48:11] &gt;&gt; and God anointed this man
[48:13] &gt;&gt; and I'm not called here to figure out
[48:16] what I can find wrong with them or wrong
[48:20] with their message or wrong with what
[48:22] they said. That's not my calling. I'm
[48:24] called here to believe
[48:27] &gt;&gt; what God has made known to me.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; And he was made in the likeness of men.
[48:34] Verse eight. And being found in fashion
[48:36] as a man, he humbled himself and became
[48:39] obedient unto death, even the death of
[48:42] the cross. And then we go on to 2
[48:44] Corinthians, I'm sorry, 2 Corinthians 3
[48:47] and 6.
[48:51] who also
[48:56] who also hath made us able ministers of
[48:59] the New Testament, not of the letter,
[49:03] but of the spirit. For the letter kleth,
[49:06] but the spirit giveth life. But if the
[49:08] ministration of death written in and
[49:11] engraven in stones was glorious, so that
[49:15] the children of Israel could not
[49:17] steadfastly behold the face of Moses,
[49:20] for the glory of his countenance, which
[49:23] glory was to be done away, how shall not
[49:27] the ministration of the spirit be rather
[49:30] glorious? For if the ministration of
[49:32] condemnation be glory, much more doth
[49:36] the ministration of righteousness exceed
[49:39] in glory. For even that which was made
[49:42] glorious hath no glory in this respect,
[49:46] but reason by reason of the glory that
[49:50] excelth.
[49:51] For if that which is done away was
[49:54] glorious,
[49:56] much more that which remainth is
[49:58] glorious. Now that's a verse we want to
[50:01] remember. Although we may not have re
[50:05] understood some of the things we read.
[50:07] For if that which is done away, the law
[50:10] was done away and and fulfilled much
[50:14] more that which remainth is glorious.
[50:16] There is some that remains and somehow
[50:19] we are here. Verse 12. Seeing then that
[50:23] we have such hope, we use great
[50:26] plainness of speech,
[50:30] we use much great plainness of speech,
[50:33] and not as Moses, which put a veil over
[50:37] his face, that the children of Israel
[50:40] could not steadfastly look to the end of
[50:43] that which is abolished. But their mind
[50:46] was blinded. For until this day, notice
[50:49] this phrase, for until this day remainth
[50:53] the same veil untaken away in the
[50:56] reading of the Old Testament, which veil
[50:59] is done away in Christ. But even unto
[51:03] this day, but even unto this day, when
[51:06] Moses is read, the veil is upon their
[51:09] heart because they had an idea what he
[51:11] was saying. They had it all conceived,
[51:15] already set up,
[51:16] &gt;&gt; right? as they have today. Whether it be
[51:19] what brand you want, you can have any
[51:21] brand from Catholic to Orthodox to
[51:24] Methodist to Baptist to whatever you
[51:28] want. And so you say, "Well, are you
[51:30] different?" Yeah, we are different.
[51:32] We're different because
[51:34] uh one phrase that you will f have found
[51:36] in the message when God a man he says a
[51:40] word is a word. It just remains a word.
[51:44] And it's if if it's not more than a
[51:46] written word, then it just remains a
[51:48] written word. And there be all kinds of
[51:50] people have a different understanding of
[51:52] a written word. You have one education.
[51:54] You came from one country. You have a
[51:56] background. You may think of it even in
[51:58] another language. And and so a certain
[52:01] written word has a certain reference to
[52:04] you and you you think of it that way.
[52:07] But but the prophet of God would maybe
[52:10] give a a word or say, "Well, I heard
[52:12] that when I was a kid. I I heard that in
[52:15] other churches and so on."
[52:17] But then when God comes and manifests
[52:21] that word or makes it known or when God
[52:25] does something and and fulfills a
[52:28] certain word and unites it, merges it
[52:31] with time and events in time and the
[52:35] people and the and and maybe the customs
[52:38] that are happening on the street and in
[52:41] other churches in in homes and and he
[52:43] manifests that
[52:44] &gt;&gt; this is my word for the time
[52:47] &gt;&gt; then then it's gone beyond a word.
[52:49] Prophet says then he's manifested it
[52:52] &gt;&gt; and once he's shown it once God has come
[52:55] behind it and shown it then that's the
[52:58] supernatural part and by believing the
[53:01] supernatural part you're a different
[53:04] kind of a person.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; That's that's the difference in the
[53:08] message.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:11] Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the
[53:14] Lord, when it which is the heart shall
[53:16] turn to the Lord, the veil shall be
[53:18] taken away. Now the Lord is that spirit,
[53:21] and where the spirit of the Lord is,
[53:23] there is liberty. But we all with open
[53:28] face, beholding as in a glass the glory
[53:32] of the Lord, are changed into the same
[53:36] image from glory to glory, even as by
[53:39] the spirit of the Lord. Let's read that
[53:41] 18th verse together. But we all with
[53:44] open face beholding as in a glass the
[53:48] glory of the Lord are changed into the
[53:52] same image from glory to glory even as
[53:56] by the spirit of the Lord. Amen. Thank
[54:00] you for standing. You may be seated.
[54:09] Brother Brandham in the message actually
[54:11] had gone further and he read the next
[54:14] verses of chapter 4
[54:16] uh of 2 Corinthians. Therefore, seeing
[54:20] we have this ministry, we have received
[54:23] mercy, we faint not, but have renounced
[54:27] the hidden things of dishonesty, not
[54:30] walking in craftiness, nor handling the
[54:33] word of God, deceitfully,
[54:36] but by manifestation of the truth,
[54:39] commending ourselves to every man's
[54:42] conscience in the sight of God. But if
[54:45] our gospel be hid, it is hid to them
[54:48] that are lost.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Right
[54:50] &gt;&gt; now, there are some principles and I
[54:53] have been holding these things in my
[54:55] heart forever, ever, ever so long, and I
[54:58] finally decided uh I'll uh I just talked
[55:02] to Tom and I've been kind of waiting for
[55:04] the last few weeks to maybe approach
[55:07] this, but I wasn't ready. So, brother
[55:10] Tom graciously
[55:12] uh preached the word and and we were
[55:14] very much blessed and others also.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Now, when brother Brandham was done with
[55:23] this uh reading of this scripture,
[55:28] he he said his prayer and I want to
[55:32] I want to give several quotes. I put
[55:35] them on the screen so I will read them
[55:38] and you can read them. Those that read
[55:40] fast, don't read fast. Just ponder them
[55:43] along as you go. Go follow me and I'll
[55:47] read slow.
[55:49] Is that all right?
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Are we all in agreement?
[55:53] &gt;&gt; All right. Good. Good.
[56:10] They had my clicker hidden.
[56:16] Could we just dim the lights a wee bit,
[56:18] please? Thank you.
[56:22] Here's the prayer. May the Lord add his
[56:24] blessings to the reading of his word.
[56:28] Now, my subject this morning, I trust
[56:31] that God will reveal this and each time
[56:35] if you take the tapes and listen and I
[56:38] hope and trust that you have had a
[56:42] spiritual understanding of what that God
[56:46] has been in trying to get over to the
[56:49] church. So, I I stopped there. What What
[56:52] has God been trying to get over to the
[56:54] church?
[57:00] I'm silent for a moment just because
[57:03] that's the way I am when I read. I
[57:05] think, what has God been trying to get
[57:07] over to the church?
[57:10] &gt;&gt; I hope I haven't missed anything.
[57:14] Um, and and and getting over to the
[57:17] church without saying it right out.
[57:20] So, that puts a little question on it
[57:24] right there.
[57:26] It's a thing sometime we have to say
[57:30] things in such a way that it might thin
[57:33] down.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; We have to say things in such a way that
[57:39] it might thin down.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; It might bring some to go out. Wow.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Some to leave
[57:50] and some to ponder over. The Bible says
[57:53] when the angel of the Lord came to Mary
[57:56] Magdalene or not Mary Magdalene but Mary
[57:58] the Virgin Mary and said you're going to
[58:01] have a child and the Holy Spirit is
[58:05] going to overshadow you and uh that
[58:09] which will be conceived in you will be
[58:12] of the Holy Ghost.
[58:14] That that that's incredible. And she how
[58:17] how will these things be? I've not known
[58:19] a man.
[58:22] So, right away she's going into the
[58:24] medical side of things. I haven't
[58:27] received any sperm from a man.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; How will anything be conceived in me?
[58:33] But this is going to be of the Holy
[58:35] Ghost. The Bible says she pondered these
[58:38] things.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; So, I I felt to say, and I wrote it
[58:42] down, don't ponder too long.
[58:47] Ponder these things, but don't ponder
[58:49] them into till you wound them down into
[58:52] unbelief. Ponder them so that you can
[58:54] believe them.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Till you finally come to the conclusion,
[58:58] well, I don't know how it's going to
[59:00] happen, but it's just going to happen
[59:02] because he has said this to me.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; But it may cause some to leave or some
[59:11] to ponder over. But that's done
[59:13] purposely.
[59:15] it because it must be done that way. It
[59:19] must be done that way.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Spiritual things must be done that way.
[59:25] And when we go to the scripture, if you
[59:28] go to the teachings of Jesus and read
[59:30] the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke,
[59:32] and John, you will find that Jesus
[59:35] actually invited people to disbelieve.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Because he knew that those that were
[59:42] called can't be can't disbelieve.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; He gave them a lot of room.
[59:50] And then when I listen to the prophets
[59:52] ministry, I find and I'm just saying
[59:55] this to you because I'm not here to try
[59:57] to convince you of anything.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; If you're a believer, you are convinced.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; And if you're an unbeliever, well, you
[1:00:05] are a makebeliever, you might just be
[1:00:07] trying to figure out what I'm sitting
[1:00:09] here and saying, what can I criticize?
[1:00:12] You can criticize lots of things.
[1:00:15] If you need any help, I'll help you.
[1:00:24] Then it might be I'm carrying on in the
[1:00:27] message now. Then it might be that some
[1:00:30] would say, "You mean would would that
[1:00:33] God would purposely do a thing like
[1:00:36] that?" He certainly did.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; And he does yet.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; We carry on. He said one day and I put
[1:00:48] the multitudes up there. He because he
[1:00:51] deals with three groups. He deals with
[1:00:53] multitudes, the ministerial ministerial
[1:00:56] association and and he describes the
[1:00:59] ministerial association. He goes back to
[1:01:01] the 70 that Jesus chose and he he he he
[1:01:05] just compares with things that they
[1:01:07] might do today and so on so forth. It's
[1:01:09] all the same. It's it's Jesus Christ the
[1:01:12] same yesterday and forever and the
[1:01:14] people are the same.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; He said one day when there were
[1:01:18] thousands around him, he said, "Except
[1:01:21] you eat the flesh of the son of God, son
[1:01:24] of man, and drink his blood, you have no
[1:01:27] life in you." What kind of a statement
[1:01:30] do you think that a medical doctor or a
[1:01:33] nurse Now we read this over very quick,
[1:01:37] but allow me to stop.
[1:01:41] educated people.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Not that brother Brandham says, "I'm not
[1:01:47] supporting ignorance."
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; He had nothing wrong with going to
[1:01:52] universities or colleges or getting as
[1:01:56] high an education as you possibly can.
[1:01:59] But you must never allow that to tinker
[1:02:02] with your faith.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:10] No matter regardless of what you've
[1:02:12] learned or what someone remember when
[1:02:14] you study a book, you're just studying
[1:02:16] someone else's brain.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; There's no brain
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; that equals this one.
[1:02:26] [Applause]
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; And there's no brain that equals who
[1:02:31] this sent.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; If you believe on him who he has sent,
[1:02:37] Right. Right.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; And so he says, "Why do you think that a
[1:02:42] medical doctor or a nurse or any fine
[1:02:47] intellectual person
[1:02:51] is educated people? So now education is
[1:02:55] fine but you must not let it allow allow
[1:02:58] it to become a trap
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; to you
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; to that somehow now you've read in the
[1:03:05] book and you're going to figure things
[1:03:06] out.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Hey this last week I was to a doctor.
[1:03:13] It's a young young doctor
[1:03:16] and uh my wife was with me
[1:03:20] and uh she's oriental
[1:03:24] and I find many of them very very
[1:03:26] brilliant
[1:03:27] but she had studied things in a books
[1:03:29] and she said I'm strongly suspicious
[1:03:35] that uh your heart is diseased.
[1:03:38] I'm strongly suspicious. And she says, I
[1:03:41] want you to have an angiogram and I'll
[1:03:44] arrange that and I want you to wear a
[1:03:46] patch and I and while she was saying it,
[1:03:49] I thought, I'm not having an angiogram
[1:03:51] and I'm not having a not wearing this
[1:03:53] patch and and she's writing out the uh
[1:03:56] and I was feeling sorry for her while
[1:03:58] she was writing out prescription because
[1:04:00] I'm not doing any of that.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:07] Anyway, but she learned it in a book and
[1:04:10] was going to impose what she learned in
[1:04:12] a book onto me. And I've learned some
[1:04:15] other things from another book and I
[1:04:17] just I choose to read those things. And
[1:04:22] yet on the on the same hand, I respect
[1:04:24] those people very very highly. And uh
[1:04:27] but something witnesses like I think it
[1:04:30] was Charles Wesley's father that said to
[1:04:32] him on his deathbed, "It's the inner
[1:04:34] witness, son. It's the inner witness.
[1:04:37] And so I go for the inner witness while
[1:04:40] I'm sitting down with wise people and
[1:04:42] people who are educated and people who
[1:04:44] know about my body and they've studied
[1:04:46] all about the anatomy etc etc and they
[1:04:50] will say something and and I have sat
[1:04:52] before one of the finest uh uh spinal
[1:04:56] doctors in Vancouver. In fact is he's
[1:04:59] over the spinal uh division in the
[1:05:02] Vancouver General Hospital. I sat there
[1:05:05] and I had I went down to Seattle and had
[1:05:07] some pictures taken this a few years
[1:05:09] ago. And and so he asked me, "Where'd
[1:05:11] you have these pictures taken?" I said,
[1:05:12] "In Seattle." He said, "Well, they're
[1:05:14] good enough for diagnosis diagnostics,
[1:05:17] but I wouldn't operate with these. I
[1:05:19] would do my own."
[1:05:21] And so he he had them up on the screen
[1:05:24] and put them all up on the screen. I'm
[1:05:26] looking at all my bones and stuff. And
[1:05:29] he says, uh,
[1:05:32] well, he said, if you tell me that you'd
[1:05:34] like to operate, I'll operate,
[1:05:36] but if you tell me that you'd like to
[1:05:38] wait
[1:05:40] a while, I think that would be good,
[1:05:43] too. Those are his words. And I said,
[1:05:47] uh, I I think I'll wait.
[1:05:51] And he said, I think that's a good idea.
[1:05:53] He said, you know, a nerve will heal.
[1:05:56] And when he said that, It just like a
[1:05:59] resounding within me said, "God made you
[1:06:01] say that."
[1:06:03] That's just why I came here. God made
[1:06:05] you say that. And I've used that phrase
[1:06:09] dozens of times. A nerve will heal.
[1:06:13] Hallelujah. Of course, it'll heal. God
[1:06:15] made it that way.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; You know how many years ago that is?
[1:06:21] That's I've gone hunting and gone on the
[1:06:24] quads and did everything that everyone
[1:06:26] else does and uh I I think that's fine.
[1:06:30] So education is fine. Don't get me
[1:06:32] wrong. That's why we have a school.
[1:06:36] He says but what for a man that had a
[1:06:39] ministry like that? He said a fine
[1:06:41] intellectual person would think of a
[1:06:44] statement. What would they think of a
[1:06:45] statement like that? Drink my blood, eat
[1:06:47] my flesh. He says, "For a man that had a
[1:06:50] ministry like that, like he had, like
[1:06:52] Jesus had."
[1:06:56] Why would he say eat the flesh? That's
[1:07:00] cannibal
[1:07:02] to drink human blood. It's vampire.
[1:07:05] And furthermore, I tell you, it's
[1:07:07] absolutely opposed to the scripture.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Please
[1:07:14] let that sink in. Amen.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus said things that were absolutely
[1:07:20] opposed to Old Testament scripture,
[1:07:23] which was the only scripture they had.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; And an intellectual person would say,
[1:07:28] "No wonder they would walk away."
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; You've allowed things to, you know, turn
[1:07:37] around in your mind and say, "Well, you
[1:07:40] know,
[1:07:42] that's that's not really the way it is,
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; right? I just came up with one few days
[1:07:48] ago. Everybody, brother Brandon,
[1:07:49] whenever he refers to Na, how many have
[1:07:52] heard him refer to Nika?
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; About eight or 10 people. How?
[1:08:00] And he says Rome.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; And and my wife has detected it and
[1:08:07] others and they said, "Well, Na is not
[1:08:09] in Rome. It's in Italy. It's in not
[1:08:12] Italy and Turkey."
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. But when
[1:08:16] when the Constantine was over and all
[1:08:19] the rest of it, it was under Roman rule.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; It was under the Roman kingdom
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; at that time.
[1:08:29] So he says, "What do you think they
[1:08:30] would say to drink human blood? It's a
[1:08:33] vampire." In other words, he wants us to
[1:08:36] be cannibals and vampires. And the
[1:08:39] whole, this was the result of it. The
[1:08:42] whole audience walked away
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; from hell.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. They were healed or they they were
[1:08:51] had all kinds of miracles happen. They
[1:08:54] ate supernatural bread
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; that he kept multiplying to them.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; I was there. They could say, "I was
[1:09:01] there." But now they're walking away.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; So something was overpowering in their
[1:09:07] in their reasoning and the whole
[1:09:10] audience walked away.
[1:09:12] And I've just put down the scripture
[1:09:14] strictly forbade to do such things as to
[1:09:18] drink blood.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Just put I want it down in language that
[1:09:22] you understand it.
[1:09:26] And then he the the next group is and
[1:09:29] there was a ministerial association. Now
[1:09:32] we've gone from number one group was the
[1:09:34] multitudes.
[1:09:36] Second group is a ministerial
[1:09:38] association that those multitudes likely
[1:09:41] listened to. And there was a ministerial
[1:09:44] association with him of 70 that he had
[1:09:48] chosen.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; And he turned to them and he said, "What
[1:09:52] will you think when you see the Son of
[1:09:55] Man ascending up from where he came
[1:09:58] from?"
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Now, he didn't explain that.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; He never explained how.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:06] Paul did that later on. He just said it
[1:10:10] and then when his this he said, "What
[1:10:14] will you say to these ministers when you
[1:10:17] see the Son of Man ascending up from
[1:10:20] where he came from?" No doubt the men
[1:10:23] said, "Now just a moment. Oh, we eat
[1:10:27] with him. We fish with him." Don't think
[1:10:31] that I haven't included myself in this,
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; right? We hunt with him.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; We sleep in the same tent.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; We eat.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; We make
[1:10:44] pancakes together.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Somebody served Jesus.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; They the women and so on. It was we we
[1:10:54] can't have all spiritual things up here
[1:10:56] in some hooks
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; place where we can't get it get real.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; It was right here. Jesus had clothes
[1:11:05] like you have clothes. Jesus washed like
[1:11:08] you washed.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus wept like you weep.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus had all of these things. And so
[1:11:14] people could see his humanity. They had
[1:11:16] to come to grips with that. When he
[1:11:18] said, "What will you say when the what
[1:11:21] will you say to these ministers and say
[1:11:23] the son of man? You see the son of man
[1:11:25] ascending up from where he came from?"
[1:11:28] No doubt. They said just a moment. We
[1:11:31] eat with him. We fish with him. We sleep
[1:11:34] with him.
[1:11:36] We know where he was born. We see the
[1:11:39] cradle that he was rocked in. And how
[1:11:41] does this man, this is a hard saying,
[1:11:45] and the Bible said that they didn't walk
[1:11:47] with him anymore. It was John 6 and 66.
[1:11:53] I looked that up for you, so you can put
[1:11:56] that down if you want. John 6 verse 66.
[1:12:09] Then he had 12 left.
[1:12:13] That's group three.
[1:12:17] Had the audience of the multitudes.
[1:12:22] And he had this is just after. Now don't
[1:12:25] forget the scripture is the unveiling of
[1:12:28] God.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; And the one who was saying these things
[1:12:33] was God in flesh.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; The one who was speaking and I will go
[1:12:38] further in in uh in and I want to show
[1:12:41] you today before I close. I want to show
[1:12:44] you that he was actually the mercy seat.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; He was the mercy seat.
[1:12:54] and they were walking away from the
[1:12:56] mercy seat.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; That's what I want you to hear.
[1:13:02] Don't ever walk away from the mercy seat
[1:13:05] cuz I'm also going to take and show you
[1:13:07] how the mercy seat moved down in stages
[1:13:12] to this present time.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; People think, well, I'm just leaving a
[1:13:17] message. I I'm done with that.
[1:13:22] Don't leave the mercy seat.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Make sure you're not walking away from
[1:13:27] the mercy seat.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; It's not walking away from brother this
[1:13:33] or sister that or whatever that or I'm
[1:13:36] walking away from this mistake or this
[1:13:38] error. I'm walking away. No, you you you
[1:13:44] brother Ed is saying some very very
[1:13:46] serious things. You be careful what you
[1:13:48] walk away from.
[1:13:50] and at other in other cases walk away
[1:13:53] from it very quickly
[1:14:01] and he had 12 left.
[1:14:05] This is incredible
[1:14:07] God
[1:14:09] all these people that have left
[1:14:13] and he chose he chose 12 and one of them
[1:14:16] was a devil.
[1:14:18] He said, "So he turned to them and
[1:14:22] there's no one could explain what he had
[1:14:24] just said,
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:27] [Music]
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; How are they going to eat his flesh and
[1:14:33] drink his blood?"
[1:14:35] And notice this next line, "And how did
[1:14:38] he come down when he was born right here
[1:14:42] on earth?"
[1:14:45] They couldn't understand it. That's
[1:14:47] number one. They couldn't understand it.
[1:14:51] And neither can you understand
[1:14:54] everything that this message has spoken
[1:14:57] for our time or anything that God may
[1:15:01] even vindicate or utter or prove that
[1:15:04] this is me. It doesn't mean that you'll
[1:15:07] understand it.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; You're nice and quiet.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; That's just exactly what I want.
[1:15:17] And furthermore, we'll go on a little
[1:15:19] further. They couldn't understand it.
[1:15:22] And then he turned to those to to the
[1:15:25] apostles and he said, "Do you want to go
[1:15:28] also?
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; This is the Lord Jesus,
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; This is a mercy seat. This is the son of
[1:15:35] God.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; This is the holy one of Israel. Do you
[1:15:39] want to go also?"
[1:15:42] And that's when the apostle Peter made
[1:15:44] that great statement, Lord, to whom
[1:15:47] would
[1:15:49] we go? For we are satisfied. We know
[1:15:53] assuredly that you and you alone have
[1:15:56] the word of life at this hour and were
[1:16:00] satisfied of that. So they couldn't
[1:16:03] could not explain it.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Why are you a believer?
[1:16:12] You don't have to really give an answer
[1:16:16] because you you if you are a believer,
[1:16:18] you can't explain it.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; How are you a believer? I don't know
[1:16:24] exactly how people say, "Are you that
[1:16:26] gullible?" Yeah, I guess so.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Either that or I'm just that simple or
[1:16:34] whatever more. I don't know what it is.
[1:16:41] You can't explain faith.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; It's something that you believe
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; and it's so solid that there's nothing
[1:16:49] else will take its place.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; I can tell you the proof of this
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; daily. Daily. You're with people. You're
[1:16:57] with your neighbors. You're with your
[1:17:00] peers. You're maybe in a a workplace.
[1:17:04] And you know as well as I know and I'm
[1:17:06] going to bear right down on you. People
[1:17:09] look at you admirably
[1:17:12] or hatefully or spitefully, whatever,
[1:17:15] but they there's a good number of people
[1:17:17] that look at you admirably.
[1:17:20] They wish they had your life.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; They wish they had that appearance.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; They wish they had that peace.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; They wish they had that stability.
[1:17:33] Amen.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; I remember walking to a man's place up
[1:17:40] on above my wife's father's store and he
[1:17:43] had rooms up there and and uh I was in
[1:17:48] my little room and I walked over to this
[1:17:51] other fell's room. I knew him real well.
[1:17:53] His brother was a bookkeeper in the
[1:17:55] store and I walked over to him, knocked
[1:17:58] on his door and he was laying on his
[1:18:01] cot.
[1:18:05] They always called me Biscll.
[1:18:08] He said, "Biscll"?
[1:18:10] He said, "you don't know how many times
[1:18:12] I've laid on this bed
[1:18:14] weeping."
[1:18:16] and he gritted his teeth and said
[1:18:19] saying, "I wish I could live the life
[1:18:22] you live."
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; And then he began to just opened up like
[1:18:27] he was split open. He said, "You may not
[1:18:30] know it, but he says, I'm a married
[1:18:32] man."
[1:18:34] He said, "I went to war.
[1:18:36] My wife left me." And he says, "And uh I
[1:18:41] have two two daughters." He was shocking
[1:18:44] me. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; This guy was Smitty who he would just
[1:18:47] went out and hunted with. I mean, he
[1:18:49] just like blurted open everything.
[1:18:53] And I said to him, I said, he says, "And
[1:18:56] one of my daughters is coming on the
[1:18:58] train
[1:19:00] to see me." He said,
[1:19:03] "And I'm going to meet her here."
[1:19:06] He says, "I haven't seen her since
[1:19:09] I came back from war."
[1:19:13] And I says, "Uh, Smmedy,"
[1:19:16] his name was Smith. I said, "I'm going
[1:19:19] to go back to my room right now. I'm
[1:19:23] going to pray
[1:19:26] that you and your wife will come
[1:19:28] together and so that your children."
[1:19:32] And I went back to my room.
[1:19:35] You talk about humility and simplicity.
[1:19:38] I'm talking about a God that works.
[1:19:40] Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a God that is a living
[1:19:43] God.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; And I prayed that that somehow somehow
[1:19:50] couldn't explain it, couldn't understand
[1:19:52] it. I just heard it a few moments ago
[1:19:54] and I just prayed that somehow God would
[1:19:57] do something supernatural.
[1:20:01] And the next time I talked to him, when
[1:20:03] his wife his daughter came on the train,
[1:20:07] it was his wife instead of his daughter.
[1:20:10] and he went back to Brford, Ontario. And
[1:20:14] I saw him years later when I was in
[1:20:17] Ontario. And he he said if God would do
[1:20:20] that, he would serve God the rest of his
[1:20:23] life. Now, he would lay on that very cot
[1:20:28] and grit his teeth and say he would want
[1:20:31] to live that life. I'm telling you,
[1:20:33] there's people that want to live your
[1:20:35] life. Yes.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; They have a certain ambition to live
[1:20:40] their life
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; or to get out of the mess that they're
[1:20:42] in or whatever. It's it Listen, friends,
[1:20:46] the message isn't for everybody.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; That's just that simple.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; It's not for everybody. Can I hear you
[1:20:52] say amen?
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; But there are people that admire it and
[1:20:58] they they they love the glow. And where
[1:21:02] do you find young ladies like this? And
[1:21:05] listen, you just thank God you are who
[1:21:08] you are by the grace of God.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Therefore, they knew that the word that
[1:21:21] was written for that age that they were
[1:21:24] living in, the Messiah age, that he fit
[1:21:29] that place exactly. That's what they
[1:21:31] knew. They couldn't explain it. And what
[1:21:34] they could what what could they do? Uh
[1:21:38] what could they do to go back in them
[1:21:41] cold formal churches that they came out
[1:21:45] of said where would we go to? We are
[1:21:49] fully persuaded that you have the word
[1:21:52] of life. And they couldn't explain it
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; but they believed it
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; and I identify with that sir
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; 100%. Yeah,
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; they couldn't explain it. I can't
[1:22:05] explain exactly. But I can tell you all
[1:22:08] for a thousand tongues.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; I can tell you I I wouldn't I wouldn't
[1:22:13] take another life for anything.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; You can have the whole world
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; have all their entertainment and all of
[1:22:21] their whatever they're in taken up with
[1:22:24] taken up.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; But give me this Jesus.
[1:22:41] And Jesus said that
[1:22:47] the reason why I didn't want to preach
[1:22:49] this, I want Jesus to take
[1:22:50] responsibility for it.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:53] Otherwise, you'll go from here. Or some
[1:22:55] might go from here. Or some might be
[1:22:57] streaming. Or some might be listening
[1:23:00] just for to find out what they could
[1:23:03] find wrong. And they say, "Well, this is
[1:23:04] what brother Ed Biscll said." No, this
[1:23:06] is what Jesus said.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; This is what a prophet of God said about
[1:23:10] what Jesus said.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said that to weed down his
[1:23:15] crowd
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; till he could get the group together.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; What group together? There is a group
[1:23:23] till he could get a group together.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; You have come together. I want you to
[1:23:29] realize that who you're sitting beside
[1:23:32] came here for a purpose.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Maybe different purposes. I don't know.
[1:23:37] But you came here for a certain purpose.
[1:23:40] Jesus, if you had been here and Jesus
[1:23:42] was a minister, he would say things that
[1:23:45] if possible, it would weed the crew, the
[1:23:48] group down till he had their group that
[1:23:51] believed him. Yeah.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; And out of all of those people, only 11
[1:23:59] of them
[1:24:01] then understood exactly, now notice now,
[1:24:05] not what it was or explain what they
[1:24:08] believed, but explain they understood
[1:24:11] who he was.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; This is what the prophet of God is
[1:24:16] speaking. That's what the message is all
[1:24:17] about. The unveiling of God. Right?
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; And if it was just that simple, it it
[1:24:24] wouldn't have to be explained.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; And it's not actually explained. That's
[1:24:28] why you could read the message book. You
[1:24:31] can read the whole New Testament.
[1:24:34] Multitudes.
[1:24:36] This is a this is a paradox to me how
[1:24:39] multitudes of people hate God, hate the
[1:24:43] gospel, hate anything to do with purity,
[1:24:46] etc. And yet when they die, they want
[1:24:49] somebody somebody to read some scripture
[1:24:51] over them or put them in heaven.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; They don't want to go to heaven. They'll
[1:24:56] be miserable in heaven.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Forgive me. Don't forgive me.
[1:25:08] Who understood actually who he was. They
[1:25:13] knowed that he was God. and God alone.
[1:25:17] And now this is brother Brennham
[1:25:20] speaking. And now my subject this
[1:25:22] morning is to reveal or unveil that God.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; When you read that message,
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; whether you got it or not, that was the
[1:25:35] purpose
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; to unveil that God.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; And you may or may not have got it. You
[1:25:45] may want to go back and reread now, but
[1:25:48] this is his opening phrases.
[1:25:52] And this was the purpose of this service
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; is to redirect you to that.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't want to go over
[1:26:03] the messages super, you know, in a light
[1:26:07] way.
[1:26:09] Um,
[1:26:12] you have to excuse me here. I'm I'm
[1:26:14] doing my very best for you
[1:26:21] to reveal or unveil that God.
[1:26:25] Now, I just have your attention for a
[1:26:27] few moments and I have a few more slides
[1:26:29] to show you
[1:26:32] in the making.
[1:26:34] The the the subject was
[1:26:38] making the making of the son of man. And
[1:26:42] I want to give it another another title
[1:26:46] at this point and that is the making of
[1:26:48] the mercy seat.
[1:26:54] You know, we're a lot of nice people
[1:26:56] here. We're friendly people. I hope
[1:27:00] we're all different natures, etc. But
[1:27:03] there's not a man or a woman.
[1:27:07] There's not a child.
[1:27:10] There's not a person that at some time
[1:27:13] in your life, you may not feel that this
[1:27:15] morning you're sitting here, you may not
[1:27:17] feel that, but believe me, there's not
[1:27:21] not a single one. But what someday will
[1:27:24] need mercy.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Mercy is not something that you have.
[1:27:31] Mercy is not something you deserve.
[1:27:37] And mercy is not compassion.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Mercy is not sympathy.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Mercy is not forgiveness.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Mercy is something you don't possess.
[1:27:55] I had a I have the quote on this, but I
[1:27:58] won't refer to it
[1:28:00] except to say
[1:28:03] the prophet of God said, "You were born
[1:28:06] here condemned."
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; I was born condemned.
[1:28:15] We didn't come here with there are those
[1:28:18] that maybe came in royalty or those that
[1:28:20] were those that are gifted and those
[1:28:23] that are skilled and those that have
[1:28:25] incredible mental retention.
[1:28:28] You were born here condemned.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Your parents were condemned.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Your great grandparents were condemned.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; We were condemned by sin.
[1:28:40] We were born in sin and shaped in
[1:28:43] iniquity and we needed mercy.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; And I hope that you'll understand what
[1:28:53] I'm the way I'm presenting this. We came
[1:28:57] here condemned
[1:29:00] and we needed mercy.
[1:29:03] And the only one that can give mercy
[1:29:06] is God who has mercy. Amen.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; He can give mercy.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; I want to say that so you understand it.
[1:29:17] Uh I'm not satisfied with the way it
[1:29:20] just came out.
[1:29:23] Everybody, every human that ever came
[1:29:26] into this world needs mercy.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; And we we cannot look upon someone else.
[1:29:33] Someone else we we could error and do
[1:29:36] something wrong. Say I'm sorry. and they
[1:29:38] can forgive us for it. But that but that
[1:29:42] is not mercy. Mercy is something that we
[1:29:45] don't have. Mercy is something we don't
[1:29:48] deserve. We were born condemned. And God
[1:29:51] gives mercy. And mercy could be would be
[1:29:57] I will not
[1:29:59] uh I will not attribute your sin to you.
[1:30:02] Yes,
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; you don't deserve it. But I'm not going
[1:30:07] to attribute your sin to you.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; You were born a natural unbeliever.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to attribute what goes
[1:30:16] through your mind to you.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to attribute your
[1:30:19] questions and doubt to you.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not. And that's my mercy.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; And that's what mercy is. Mercy isn't
[1:30:28] some fluff and flooy and well, you're a
[1:30:30] nice person. That's not mercy. When
[1:30:33] that's all done and I go home alone and
[1:30:36] lay my head upon my pillow, I need
[1:30:38] mercy.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; I need to know that I have contact with
[1:30:44] one who has the mercy. Amen.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; And it's only God and God alone.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Yeah.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; And this is going to maybe blow you
[1:31:00] away, but
[1:31:03] you know, we each
[1:31:06] I really question whether I would say
[1:31:08] this, but I think I will.
[1:31:17] It's hard for humans. I started out to
[1:31:20] to say it's hard for humans to
[1:31:24] uh recognize the kind of change
[1:31:28] and I use the scripture and the word was
[1:31:31] made flesh and it kind of loses people.
[1:31:34] I've used that scripture. These brethren
[1:31:36] have used these scriptures and you've
[1:31:38] quoted these scriptures. You've read
[1:31:40] these scriptures perhaps hundreds of
[1:31:42] times. But to to to
[1:31:45] watch how how does it evolve that the
[1:31:48] word was made flesh? I I can't really
[1:31:50] explain that, but I believe that
[1:31:52] perfectly.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Don't get me wrong, but each one of you
[1:32:00] here one day were just a sperm.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; That's all you were.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; You were a sperm within your father.
[1:32:16] And that sperm came to the womb of your
[1:32:19] mom,
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; That's every person.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter how handsome and how
[1:32:27] beautiful and all the rest of it you may
[1:32:29] be. That's what you wear.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; And out of that
[1:32:35] and by the design of the creator,
[1:32:39] you were born a child.
[1:32:41] and you came into the world and you grew
[1:32:43] into the person you are.
[1:32:47] But you nobody I've talked to thousands
[1:32:49] of people. I haven't talked to people
[1:32:53] who gloried you know what I was once
[1:32:57] just a sperm.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; They don't talk about that. They'll talk
[1:33:01] about when they were young and talked
[1:33:03] about when they were in education. They
[1:33:05] talked about when they were in the
[1:33:07] military or what what they did in life
[1:33:10] and all the rest of it, but they don't
[1:33:11] talk about, but God knew you when you
[1:33:14] were just a sperm.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; God knew you prior to that.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; And he says, "This sperm isn't going to
[1:33:23] turn out very good.
[1:33:28] So, they're going to need my mercy.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; They're going to need my mercy. and I've
[1:33:34] got it to give it to them.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; This isn't a wack old preacher here, but
[1:33:44] my mind does go out on strange places.
[1:33:48] And that would help you to understand
[1:33:50] that going from one thing, you evolve to
[1:33:53] another to the person you are. Yes,
[1:33:55] you're dressed very nice and your hair
[1:33:57] is done very nice and all of you're very
[1:33:59] very fine people and so you've you've
[1:34:03] come some distance,
[1:34:08] but this very fine body is going to lay
[1:34:10] on a slab
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; and some undertaker is going to pump it
[1:34:17] full of
[1:34:20] chemicals so it doesn't rot so fast.
[1:34:25] And and this is what's going to happen.
[1:34:28] It's not going to have a very uh pompous
[1:34:33] departure.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; People will do the best they can. They
[1:34:36] will say the nicest things about you and
[1:34:38] hope for somebody to put you in heaven.
[1:34:41] No, you're either in heaven now or
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; is this okay? Amen.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; People need to see how things evolve.
[1:35:01] And so I I want to I want to just take
[1:35:03] you very quickly
[1:35:06] and and and this is where maybe some of
[1:35:08] you will drop off,
[1:35:11] but I hope not. I hope not.
[1:35:17] And I'll just tell you ahead of time.
[1:35:23] No, I won't tell you ahead of time.
[1:35:32] No, I want to get down to the mercy
[1:35:35] seat.
[1:35:39] [Music]
[1:35:41] Can I shut the lights down please
[1:35:45] for just a moment? Now this is the mercy
[1:35:47] seat.
[1:35:49] This is the actually the ark. A picture
[1:35:52] of the ark as I got this off the
[1:35:55] internet. So that's a picture of the ark
[1:35:59] and where the two cherubams are with
[1:36:01] their
[1:36:03] uh perhaps I'll I'll just read what they
[1:36:06] say about that.
[1:36:08] Um,
[1:36:11] I guess I won't.
[1:36:15] But the two cherubams on top have their
[1:36:18] wings to toward each other and their
[1:36:20] faces are looking down.
[1:36:23] Now, I I just need a moment to
[1:36:26] This is They're covering the mercy seat,
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; but what is covering it is is is
[1:36:32] literally a slab.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:36] And it is about 2 and 1/2
[1:36:39] uh cubits by 1 and 1/2 cubits. 2 and 1/2
[1:36:44] cubits long and 1 and 1/2 cubits wide.
[1:36:50] You're listening real close. The only
[1:36:52] thing in that box is the word of God.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; And if you think you'll get mercy
[1:37:01] anywhere else, you are mistaken.
[1:37:07] And the cherubams which represented
[1:37:10] cherubams and Isaiah were saying holy,
[1:37:13] holy, holy. That's the only word they
[1:37:15] knew.
[1:37:18] Holy, holy, holiness to the Lord.
[1:37:24] That's what God considers very holy.
[1:37:26] That was the mercy seat
[1:37:29] and the the slab which was the actual
[1:37:32] mercy seat. It's not the whole box. The
[1:37:35] slab which was the mercy seat covered
[1:37:39] the word of God or veiled
[1:37:44] the word of God
[1:37:46] and the people. You think they can
[1:37:49] explain that?
[1:37:52] And that was in the tent of their
[1:37:54] testimony. You you think that the uh you
[1:37:58] know all the Jebusites and the
[1:38:00] Canaanites and all that came up on the
[1:38:02] hill said, "What in the world is that
[1:38:06] down there in the middle of Israel?" And
[1:38:08] they're all camped around it
[1:38:10] ceremoniously.
[1:38:12] All the 12 tribes are divided into four
[1:38:15] tribes each on and they got emblems of
[1:38:18] the uh of the camps and Judah and the
[1:38:23] different ones and you know all around
[1:38:25] the camps. What in the world is that?
[1:38:28] And and then some fanatical said, well
[1:38:30] you know I had an Israelite a friend of
[1:38:33] mine and you know what he told me? He
[1:38:34] said their god is in there.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:39] And and they have a prophet down there.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; You know, we're going to look like we're
[1:38:46] a lot of believers. They have a prophet
[1:38:49] down there and and their prophet the God
[1:38:52] said that that they'll meet their
[1:38:54] prophet uh in between these cherubams,
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; And that's their religion.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; You think they were accepted? No.
[1:39:05] They've been even hated to this day.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:39:12] Hang on, I'm just started.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Then that mercy seat evolved
[1:39:20] from a golden emblem
[1:39:23] such as that to this.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; I thought that's a beautiful picture.
[1:39:37] Jesus.
[1:39:39] Jesus.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Could we dell the lights a little more,
[1:39:42] please?
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; How are you going to figure out?
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; How are you going to explain it? Went
[1:39:57] from that to this.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; the word.
[1:40:04] What was in the ark
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; became flesh.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; And God used humans, weak humans to
[1:40:13] bring this one along because this Christ
[1:40:16] was in Moses. This Christ was in
[1:40:20] Abraham. This Christ was in all the Old
[1:40:24] Testament saints. And this Christ was
[1:40:27] in. And Jesus said himself to his
[1:40:29] disciples, to that 11 that stayed with
[1:40:32] him, I will be in you
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; and you'll be in me
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; and I'll be in the father
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; and we'll be one.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; How? I don't care how. That's what he
[1:40:45] said.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to explain it. I'm here to
[1:40:48] believe it. Amen.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Listen to me now. And with the centuries
[1:40:56] of time, you know, raised up Catholicism
[1:40:59] and and the
[1:41:03] Orthodox Church of the Greek Orthodox,
[1:41:07] Ukrainian Orthodox,
[1:41:10] Ukrainian Catholic, which I came from.
[1:41:14] all of these and
[1:41:17] all of their theories and you you think
[1:41:19] things that we do are foolish. Washing
[1:41:21] feet is foolish. Jesus washed feet.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; But they tried to push my head towards
[1:41:28] kissing some of the emblems and the
[1:41:30] wooden statues on a little table. I
[1:41:33] never saw Jesus kissing any statues. I
[1:41:36] didn't know I was only five or six, but
[1:41:39] I just pulled my head back. I I wasn't
[1:41:42] going to kiss those statues. You talk
[1:41:45] about a You talk about some weird things
[1:41:47] that happen. And I'll tell you that to
[1:41:50] have a I'm going to speak very plainly
[1:41:52] now, but to hear on the on this on the
[1:41:55] news and you hear on the news that this
[1:41:58] great church of hundreds of millions of
[1:42:02] people and now in and they just they
[1:42:06] just uh came out with some statistics
[1:42:08] out of Australia that 30 to 40%
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; of their priests were involved in sexual
[1:42:18] sins.
[1:42:19] upon young people and people still go
[1:42:22] there to church.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; That's wild.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; That's your world,
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; That's this world.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be separated from this
[1:42:36] world.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; And a lot of people want to hide their
[1:42:40] face and and and say as though they they
[1:42:43] don't want to think about that. That's
[1:42:45] the real world and that's a devil's
[1:42:47] world. And I like to have a prophet say,
[1:42:50] "And this is Satan's Eden."
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Why don't you say, "Amen."
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; This is Satan's Eden.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Every government's of the devil.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Every kingdoms of the devil.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; He's the one who said, "I'll give you
[1:43:07] the I'll if you'll bow down and worship
[1:43:10] me, I'll give you all the kingdoms of
[1:43:12] the world." Hallelujah.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus knew he was going to get them
[1:43:15] anyway.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; The reason why he's now the mercy saint
[1:43:29] and the prophet of God said certain
[1:43:31] things about this that I want you to.
[1:43:34] The veil of the temple
[1:43:37] was torn in twain from the top to the
[1:43:41] bottom because the ark which we had just
[1:43:44] seen was behind this veil.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; And God was not satisfied. Stay with me
[1:43:51] now. God was not satisfied that the ark
[1:43:55] which was his promise it it was the ten
[1:43:58] commandments that were in that veil
[1:44:01] behind in that ark behind this veil
[1:44:04] there wasn't one of the Israelites that
[1:44:07] could keep the ten commandments listen
[1:44:10] I'm preaching to you
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; there isn't one of you that can keep the
[1:44:14] ten commandments
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; and Jesus himself compounded the
[1:44:19] commandments
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; commandments and said, "Thou shalt not
[1:44:22] commit adultery." And Jesus enlarged on
[1:44:25] that and said, "If thou lookst on a
[1:44:28] woman to commit, if thou lookst on a
[1:44:30] woman to lust after her, you have
[1:44:33] committed adultery with her in your
[1:44:35] heart." Is that what he said?
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Is that what this Bible says?
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what this Bible says.
[1:44:42] There isn't a man alive that can be
[1:44:45] justified in the face of that kind of
[1:44:48] the the law. The apostle Paul said, "The
[1:44:50] law did not come to justify. The law
[1:44:53] came to condemn."
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Is there is there uh
[1:45:04] now you'll have to be just very very
[1:45:06] respectful.
[1:45:08] Is there a
[1:45:11] is there value?
[1:45:14] Is there value in living right? Is there
[1:45:17] value in living pure?
[1:45:19] Is there value in living holy?
[1:45:21] Absolutely.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; With this life, you have a better
[1:45:28] relationship.
[1:45:29] You have a you have a God-honoring
[1:45:32] relationship.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; God has honored those things.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't give you more
[1:45:38] righteousness,
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; than a prostitute,
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; or some sinner man? no more righteous.
[1:45:46] He's as pure as you are.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen. I'm gonna
[1:45:51] preach it anyway.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; When it comes to redemption, when it
[1:45:56] comes to receiving mercy, if God gives
[1:45:59] Rahab mercy,
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; that's as pure as she's as pure as the
[1:46:03] next person.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; If God and I can't explain that, but if
[1:46:11] God decided to give Ba Sheba uh to give
[1:46:15] her mercy
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; and send and in a merciful state, she
[1:46:20] brought forth Solomon.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; And Jesus referred to Solomon.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't refer to any other the sons of
[1:46:28] David, but he referred to Solomon. And
[1:46:31] he says, "A greater than Solomon is
[1:46:33] here.
[1:46:35] Amen.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Have I left you someplace?
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me?
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; But that ark was behind this veil. And
[1:46:50] the veil was
[1:46:52] the veil was torn from top to bottom.
[1:47:01] When the veil was rent at Calvary, the
[1:47:04] mercy seat came into plain view.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; It was hanging on Calvary, dripping in
[1:47:10] blood as they had took blood year after
[1:47:14] year at the cleansing of the sanctuary
[1:47:17] and the sprinkling of the mercy seat.
[1:47:19] The mercy seat had to be sprinkled with
[1:47:22] blood by the finger of the priest. And
[1:47:25] there God with his great mighty stroke
[1:47:27] of lightning power split the old badger
[1:47:31] veil from top to bottom. And the mercy
[1:47:35] seat came into plain view.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; The mercy seat came into plain view. The
[1:47:42] real genuine lamb of God was hanging in
[1:47:46] plain view on Calvary. We say amen to
[1:47:49] that. We believe that. And the mercy
[1:47:53] seat came into plain view when God had
[1:47:56] paid the price himself and become one of
[1:48:00] us and had manifested himself as a man
[1:48:04] to get acquainted with us and we to be
[1:48:08] acquainted with him. The mercy seat was
[1:48:10] in plain view of all Israel on that day
[1:48:15] of the atonement.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; They all could have seen it. He was in
[1:48:19] plain view. Now listen to me friends. We
[1:48:22] may look back, but God then changed this
[1:48:26] mercy seat to a a living word, but since
[1:48:29] Pentecost, since the crucifixion, when
[1:48:32] that veil was rent from top to bottom
[1:48:35] for that generation, for that
[1:48:37] generation, you weren't back there, but
[1:48:40] you are here.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You weren't there.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; You agree with that? You weren't there.
[1:48:46] We're not worshiping history. We're not
[1:48:48] worshiping some historical god. You were
[1:48:51] not there. All right. Where's the mercy
[1:48:54] seat for you? The same word of God.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; They couldn't explain how that word was
[1:49:01] made flesh. But they believed who he
[1:49:03] was. That's what the prophets re
[1:49:06] revealing and speaking of. They believed
[1:49:08] who he was.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; And that's the key today.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; And you have to believe who God sends.
[1:49:16] Amen.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; God sent not only a prophet in this
[1:49:21] generation, but God stood beside him
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; with a pillar of fire and confirmed
[1:49:27] things that we could not confirm
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; and said things that were even hard to
[1:49:32] believe. But you better believe it.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; You must believe whom God sent.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; That's the word
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; that he has used. And fact is friends,
[1:49:43] I'm coming to it in just a moment.
[1:49:45] That's mercy.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; That's the mercy seat
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; in this generation. You might say, "Oh,
[1:49:54] that is just wild." Let it be wild.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Can I explain it? No, I can't explain
[1:50:01] it. You can't explain it.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; And if you find fault with that, then
[1:50:07] give me the answer.
[1:50:09] [Applause]
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Don't point to a book. All right.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; I believe that this is the word of God.
[1:50:16] But the God of this, the God is
[1:50:19] necessary for the God of this word.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; The God of this word, these are words on
[1:50:27] paper, India paper.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Let the God of this word,
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; that's what the prophet of God said.
[1:50:34] That's what brother Brandham said when
[1:50:35] Charlie Mitchell was sitting there with
[1:50:38] a with a a tomb in a tumor in his lung.
[1:50:44] Is that what happened?
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; A tumor in his lung. You can hear it on
[1:50:48] the on the tape. You can hear the voice
[1:50:50] on the tape. Then I want to say, was God
[1:50:53] with the man or not?
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, God is with the man.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; You can do what you wish with it. But
[1:50:59] nevertheless, that's what happened.
[1:51:01] Amen.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; And he's sitting there, a man that I
[1:51:04] know, a man I interviewed, and he's l
[1:51:06] he's there with a tumor in his lung, the
[1:51:10] size of a man's fist,
[1:51:13] and have a man speak and say,
[1:51:17] "Let the God of Elijah,
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; if he is God,
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; let him come forth now."
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; And calls out the man. There's a man,
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; his name's Charlie Mitchell, right?
[1:51:31] That's right.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; I want you to be very respectful. Now,
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; we're talking about this God.
[1:51:43] You know, brother Benham talks about
[1:51:45] people moving and don't move if you
[1:51:47] don't need to because we all have human
[1:51:50] spirits
[1:51:51] and that is what it's it's not you
[1:51:54] physically your spirit
[1:51:57] how how that's be being treated and how
[1:52:00] it's being looked on. And just now I
[1:52:02] want to tell you God, that God,
[1:52:06] the God of Jesus Christ, who you saw
[1:52:09] hanging here on a cross, just a picture
[1:52:11] of him, the God of William Brandham, the
[1:52:14] God of the prophets, the God of Moses,
[1:52:17] and the God of your God.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; I say it regularly, my God,
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; the Holy One of Israel.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Do you identify with that God?
[1:52:29] Do you identify with him?
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what this church
[1:52:36] exists for.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; A living God.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm interested in this
[1:52:42] message because it's a living God.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; It's the only message I know that God
[1:52:48] came down
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; and God proved his existence.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; God proved his presence. Amen.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; That's what you want to hang on to
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; where God proved himself.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; I'm standing by this man. I'm standing
[1:53:04] by this word.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; And Charlie Mitchell goes back to the
[1:53:09] very hospitals, three of them, the
[1:53:12] hospitals that sent him on behalf of the
[1:53:16] coal mine that he worked in. and brother
[1:53:19] Brandham if oh my goodness friends have
[1:53:23] you listened to the word the way because
[1:53:25] I knew some of these people I've
[1:53:27] listened and I'm conveying it to you
[1:53:30] allow me to do that
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; and you can hear it with your own ears
[1:53:34] if you wish to go get the tape and
[1:53:37] listen to him call Charlie Mitchell out
[1:53:40] and he says you have been a mine worker
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; that's like saying, "You have been a
[1:53:50] sinner,
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; but you're not a sinner anymore.
[1:53:54] You have been an unbeliever, but you're
[1:53:56] not an unbeliever anymore. You believe
[1:54:01] [Applause]
[1:54:02] [Music]
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; another thing about this mercy seat you
[1:54:05] saw saw a moment ago, uh, the slab and
[1:54:09] and the and the cherubams on top and God
[1:54:13] speaking, whether you believe it or
[1:54:14] don't believe it, you want to believe
[1:54:16] this." And God said, "And you put two
[1:54:20] cherubams on top."
[1:54:22] Said to Moses, "And I
[1:54:26] will meet you there."
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah,
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; friends. However you interpret that,
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; right? Exactly right.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Bring it to us. Bring it to me. I'm
[1:54:40] seeking to bring it to you. There is a
[1:54:43] place and I won't end this service
[1:54:45] before I've said the a few more things.
[1:54:48] There is a place where God has promised
[1:54:51] to meet you.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you where it is. Tell me
[1:54:55] where it is. I can tell you where it is.
[1:54:58] It's wherever the word of God is being
[1:55:01] unfolded. Wherever it's wherever it's
[1:55:04] coming to its final end, its final
[1:55:07] fulfillment. when God is calling and he
[1:55:11] says in the end time that he's going to
[1:55:13] call a people, he's going to call a
[1:55:15] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; And you find that scripture,
[1:55:20] that promise would be in that box. That
[1:55:23] promise is in the ark. That promise was
[1:55:26] in Christ who hung on the cross. That
[1:55:29] promise is in the message. And that
[1:55:31] promise is being fulfilled. It's either
[1:55:34] fulfilled in the past or is being
[1:55:37] fulfilled or will be fulfilled. I don't
[1:55:40] know which and I don't care which.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether it has been
[1:55:45] fulfilled or is being fulfilled. I want
[1:55:48] to have the word that is uh that is the
[1:55:51] mercy seat for this hour. I want a
[1:55:55] living mercy seat.
[1:55:59] And I'm here as a testimony to tell you
[1:56:02] he's at his mercy seat.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; He's absolutely at his mercy seat.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; And why do I want to say that that way?
[1:56:11] Because I've been there.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; I've been there and he's talked to me.
[1:56:16] Yeah.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; At the mercy seat
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; when I've given myself and I'm appealing
[1:56:24] to you to give yourself to the word as I
[1:56:28] spoke of it earlier in the f earlier
[1:56:30] this service. You ponder those things.
[1:56:32] You don't try to figure them out.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; They can't be figured out.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; You'll never understand it. Tell me how.
[1:56:40] And this prophet would say how God would
[1:56:43] have mercy upon a foul people like us.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; And people want to take on an heir. And
[1:56:51] well, I'm kind of a fairly good person.
[1:56:54] There is no one good. That's why even
[1:56:56] when the man came to Jesus said, "Good
[1:56:59] master, what shall I do to inherit
[1:57:01] eternal life? Why callst thou me good?
[1:57:04] There's none good but God."
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; That's what you have to accept.
[1:57:10] There's none good but God.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; And he in his mercy at the mercy seat
[1:57:17] gave us his righteousness.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; That's why you're chosen.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; That's why that's how you become elect.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; You don't become elect because you
[1:57:29] believed a certain thing and somebody
[1:57:32] figured it all out. Now you become
[1:57:33] elect.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; That's not how it happened. You become
[1:57:37] elect because you one day you found you
[1:57:40] could do nothing for yourself.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; You found yourself a failure.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; You found yourself condemned.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; And you said, "Oh God.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Oh God."
[1:57:55] [Music]
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; It's a little chorus I wanted to sing. I
[1:58:01] asked if Linda could be here for me.
[1:58:26] I want to sing it.
[1:58:28] Maybe Brother Ryan, you can help me.
[1:58:32] We're not done the service. I just want
[1:58:34] to sing this chorus. Mercy rewrote my
[1:58:38] life.
[1:58:40] I wonder how many here want to raise
[1:58:43] your hand and say that's exactly what
[1:58:46] happened. Brother Ed
[1:58:48] Mercy.
[1:58:50] I didn't have it.
[1:58:53] I can tell you I've I've lived a fairly
[1:58:55] straight life,
[1:58:57] but I needed mercy.
[1:59:02] [Music]
[1:59:06] I told my wife last night
[1:59:10] about a debt that I just felt to pay
[1:59:13] off. We've been married 62 years, but I
[1:59:15] told her last night of a debt that I
[1:59:17] paid off
[1:59:21] in human life.
[1:59:24] That's not to make me great. I'm
[1:59:26] absolutely nothing. I needed mercy.
[1:59:30] Doesn't matter how many good things
[1:59:32] you've done, you needed mercy.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what kind of a birth you
[1:59:37] had or what kind of a country you came
[1:59:39] from, you needed mercy.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you if you want to
[1:59:45] believe me or not believe me, but mercy
[1:59:47] is found in this message.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Mercy is found in the word of God.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; That was that word was none other than
[1:59:55] the making of the son of man. Amen.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; And I have a few more things to say. It
[2:00:03] is where a person can if you try to
[2:00:06] figure it out, you can enter into a
[2:00:08] realm of
[2:00:11] almost confusion.
[2:00:15] And that's why brother Brandham had to
[2:00:17] explain
[2:00:19] I am a son of man.
[2:00:22] Right. Amen.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; He was asked, he said,
[2:00:27] "Are you the son of man?" He said, "No."
[2:00:31] "Is the pillar of fire the son of man?"
[2:00:34] "No." He said,
[2:00:36] he said, "I am a son of man."
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; revealing
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; the son of man.
[2:00:44] So somehow in the complexity
[2:00:47] of
[2:00:49] of a man in flesh is it a veil? Yes.
[2:00:54] God's word is veiled.
[2:00:57] [Music]
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; God's word is veiled in a man.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; You know something, friends?
[2:01:10] Like Tommy Osburn said,
[2:01:13] [Music]
[2:01:16] Tommy Osbborne,
[2:01:17] he said, "You won't see this again."
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:01:23] Tommy Osbbor who knew to come to brother
[2:01:26] Brandham
[2:01:28] concerning
[2:01:30] would God hear me if I prayed or Roberts
[2:01:33] did also you can read it in David Edwin
[2:01:36] Harold's book
[2:01:40] professor Harold from Birmingham Alabama
[2:01:47] the world recognized it
[2:01:53] folks. The world recognized it when he
[2:01:55] was hanging on the cross in in in
[2:01:59] different units. Finally, there was the
[2:02:00] thunder and the rocks rolled and all
[2:02:05] these things happened. The earthquake
[2:02:06] came and they said, "Surely
[2:02:10] this was the son of God."
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Right? Too late.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Right. but for the wrong purpose.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; It's not an earthquake that reveals him.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; It's not an earthquake that suddenly
[2:02:25] makes and when people have I can tell
[2:02:28] you if there's a giant earthquake which
[2:02:30] they're expecting for Vancouver. If it
[2:02:32] happens and when it happens and there
[2:02:34] will be people here just like there is
[2:02:36] today
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; and people calling you think they won't
[2:02:40] call on God. Of course they will. Sorry
[2:02:43] folks, that's not
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; what the earthquake came for.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; The earthquake simply confirmed that God
[2:02:51] who is the creator of the earth, he lets
[2:02:54] things convulse. But you've already had
[2:02:56] a prophet. You're sitting on a whole
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; cauldron
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; of boiling earth,
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; It's not the fact that it bursts open
[2:03:06] that people are going to call on God.
[2:03:08] That's fine. That's fine. But that's not
[2:03:11] it. They call it they call on God
[2:03:14] because a voice and the Holy Spirit of
[2:03:17] God speaks to the individual says this
[2:03:21] is me.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; I'm meeting you at the mercy seat.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Have you got that? I'm meeting you at
[2:03:29] the mercy seat.
[2:03:32] [Music]
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; It's evolved.
[2:03:36] The mercy seat was that box.
[2:03:41] And in Israel, they're making perhaps
[2:03:43] that very box and overlaying it with
[2:03:45] gold. He'll not be there.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; And people in the Philippines, God bless
[2:03:53] the Philippine people here. I was over
[2:03:55] there when they had people being
[2:03:57] crucified.
[2:03:59] [Music]
[2:04:01] And it's a cruel thing. They're being
[2:04:04] crucified, aren't they, brother Ernie?
[2:04:06] Yes, sir.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; And dragged on the crosses. Do they gain
[2:04:11] any righteousness? Won't give them one
[2:04:13] second in heaven.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; If they only knew
[2:04:19] and some have come to know. And how we
[2:04:22] thank God, Brother Ernie, for every
[2:04:25] every book, every translation,
[2:04:28] everything that ever has been done,
[2:04:30] every gospel that has been preached,
[2:04:32] Brother Ernie's been there many times
[2:04:34] and preached.
[2:04:35] [Music]
[2:04:37] And even if one
[2:04:40] came at the sound of the gospel,
[2:04:42] friends, it's not the multitudes. The
[2:04:45] multitudes left him.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; The 70 of the ministry left him.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; And since then have come, you don't find
[2:04:55] me to be anti. I'm not anti. But I can
[2:04:58] tell you all these I I was at an
[2:05:01] ecumenical movement
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; right
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; meeting. All of you know what ecumenical
[2:05:06] we all get together. How do you all get
[2:05:09] together and
[2:05:12] throw all your mistakes into a pot and
[2:05:14] somehow come up with some victorious
[2:05:17] thing that God is doing? It's utter
[2:05:19] nonsense.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; It's utter nonsense. I go on a record
[2:05:23] saying it's utter nonsense.
[2:05:26] Amen.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; So I stood in this service
[2:05:30] and the people were sitting on chairs
[2:05:31] and in the sofa and on the on the floor
[2:05:34] and
[2:05:36] they'd heard a radio broadcast and
[2:05:38] someone heard something
[2:05:40] and they wished me to come over to
[2:05:44] Vancouver Island and I did. 22 people
[2:05:48] were in the room.
[2:05:51] I said now I don't I didn't know any of
[2:05:52] those people except the people had
[2:05:54] invited me. said, "I don't know these
[2:05:56] people." I said, "Now, perhaps this one
[2:05:58] here might be Salvation Army. This one
[2:06:00] might be Catholic. This one here might
[2:06:02] be Baptist. This one here might be, you
[2:06:06] know, whatever, whatever, one of the
[2:06:08] other denominations." And I said, "We
[2:06:10] all have come together."
[2:06:13] I said, "Now,"
[2:06:15] I held my Bible. I said, "This Bible
[2:06:18] says that Jesus is the word."
[2:06:24] And I happen to know that you believe a
[2:06:26] different word than these people do. And
[2:06:29] you believe a different word than these
[2:06:31] people do. Is that right?
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; We got to be careful in the message. And
[2:06:36] you people believe something different
[2:06:37] than these people believe.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; And would the would the real Jesus stand
[2:06:42] up?
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; You never saw such a quiet crowd.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; And out of there came a family to become
[2:06:49] believers there in Brother Roger Smith's
[2:06:51] church.
[2:06:53] today.
[2:06:57] How did it evolve and come from that?
[2:07:01] I friends in this very very deceptive
[2:07:06] age, I would want to have the word that
[2:07:10] God was free and God felt comfortable to
[2:07:14] stand behind.
[2:07:16] He even came the the B the scripture
[2:07:20] says that he became flesh and the
[2:07:24] prophet said he came down where you and
[2:07:27] I are. Jesus was born of a woman
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; like you were
[2:07:34] for one purpose. He wanted to be near
[2:07:37] you. He wanted you to understand him. He
[2:07:41] want and God wanted to be understood
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; by the people. Can you imagine? God has
[2:07:48] done all of these things so he could be
[2:07:50] understood by the people.
[2:07:54] [Music]
[2:07:58] Okay, we'll just sing. I'd like to sing
[2:08:01] this song. Mercy rewrote my life.
[2:08:06] Mercy
[2:08:09] re
[2:08:10] my heart.
[2:08:15] His mercy
[2:08:18] re my heart.
[2:08:25] I should have fallen.
[2:08:29] My soul
[2:08:32] cast down.
[2:08:34] of mercy
[2:08:37] rule my heart
[2:08:41] once again.
[2:08:43] Oh mercy
[2:08:47] rule my heart.
[2:08:53] Oh, mercy
[2:08:56] re my life.
[2:09:00] [Applause]
[2:09:03] I should have fallen. My soul
[2:09:09] cast
[2:09:16] my life.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; I'd like the congregation to say mercy.
[2:09:22] Mercy
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; that you didn't deserve.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Say mercy.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Mercy
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; that only one had.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Only one had.
[2:09:35] [Music]
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; In the beginning
[2:09:39] was the word.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. However, whatever form, people
[2:09:43] could talk about all kinds of form, but
[2:09:45] whatever form it was, all I can tell you
[2:09:48] that in the beginning, that word
[2:09:51] possessed mercy and that's the only
[2:09:54] place of his mercy. And that is why God
[2:09:57] would say to Moses of so many thousand
[2:10:01] years ago, in there
[2:10:04] of all the nations of the world, am I
[2:10:08] making sense to you? of all the nations,
[2:10:11] of all the peoples, of all the kingdoms.
[2:10:14] But God calls a people. Why does he call
[2:10:17] a people? I don't know.
[2:10:20] But that's his own prerogative.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; He calls whom he calls.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; And if Jesus was the word made flesh and
[2:10:30] could stand on earth and say,
[2:10:33] "And they left him.
[2:10:35] They left me." The mercy seat saying
[2:10:38] they left me.
[2:10:42] [Music]
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; The mercy seat saying 70
[2:10:48] ministers which I called
[2:10:51] left me
[2:10:53] because I couldn't understand. You know
[2:10:55] what he's being reduced down? He's not
[2:10:57] trying to get people to leave him. He's
[2:10:59] trying to get people to see that there's
[2:11:01] one way. That thing that has spoken to
[2:11:05] you, that thing that illuminates. I'm
[2:11:08] looking at you young people. You really
[2:11:10] desperately need
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; something to illuminate. And if you've
[2:11:15] experienced it, then you can say, "I
[2:11:17] thank God.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; I thank God for this uh unspeakable
[2:11:22] gift." Because you can't earn it. You
[2:11:25] can't do anything for it. Hallelujah.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm speaking of, friends.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm speaking of.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; I'm not a young man, but I woke up this
[2:11:42] morning
[2:11:44] before I even leave washing my face. I
[2:11:48] stand at thanking the Lord.
[2:11:51] Thank you. We have this kind of
[2:11:53] relationship. Thank you that I can talk
[2:11:54] to you.
[2:11:56] Thank you that you've made yourself
[2:11:58] known.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you that we have such a peace.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you that mercy rewrote my life.
[2:12:10] [Music]
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Just a few more minutes, please.
[2:12:17] [Music]
[2:12:23] Here we are.
[2:12:37] since Pentecost. You remember he
[2:12:39] returned then to Paul after that and to
[2:12:43] Peter in the prison as the pillar of
[2:12:45] fire. Remember that. But in the last
[2:12:48] days, he's supposed to return again. You
[2:12:52] remember that? in the last days. Say,
[2:12:55] "Oh, yeah." Don't take it lightly. If
[2:12:59] you believe that he's returned in the
[2:13:02] last days,
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; to come back
[2:13:09] to come back again to manifest the son
[2:13:12] of man to show to show the word the
[2:13:17] light. The traditions has been will be
[2:13:21] wiped away. There is nothing going to
[2:13:24] bother it. It's going to be done anyhow.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; God just tear them denominations and
[2:13:31] traditions down. And friends, a little
[2:13:34] further on in the book, further he says
[2:13:37] here, the whole mercy seat is sitting in
[2:13:39] plain view. Anybody can see it. The veil
[2:13:42] is rent. God of glory. The whole mercy
[2:13:45] seat comes into plain view.
[2:13:49] How God could have mercy on foul sinners
[2:13:52] as us when he hid himself was a mystery.
[2:13:55] And now it's in plain view or in full
[2:13:58] view revealed by his word. It's always
[2:14:02] the word constantly. That is God. It's
[2:14:06] the word that opens it up. It's the word
[2:14:09] that opens it up. If those people would
[2:14:12] have known the word of God that day when
[2:14:15] Jesus died, they would have seen the
[2:14:18] mercy seat. They would have seen who he
[2:14:23] was. And now it's repeated again.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Pardon? Excuse me. It's repeated again.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about history now.
[2:14:33] We're talking about today. I know I'm a
[2:14:35] little bit over time, but just sit tight
[2:14:38] for a few moments before I close. But
[2:14:40] now it's repeated.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; It's not enough for us to look back and
[2:14:44] say, "Well, they missed it." Oh, I I
[2:14:47] would have seen it. You would have.
[2:14:48] Well, now's your chance.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; Now's your opportunity. Hello all up in
[2:14:53] the congregation in the balconies and so
[2:14:56] on. Now is your opportunity. Yes, sir.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; Young people, press through. You say,
[2:15:01] "Well, what's the press through?" Well,
[2:15:03] I would say take a message like this and
[2:15:06] ponder it.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; Take it a line at a time and ponder it.
[2:15:11] Ask yourself some questions. Ponder it.
[2:15:14] I can tell you one thing.
[2:15:18] I can tell you friends.
[2:15:22] this rapture,
[2:15:24] this promise that that we have.
[2:15:28] I was talking to some members of my
[2:15:30] family last night for a few moments.
[2:15:35] I'm taking very very seriously the
[2:15:38] catching away,
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; the rapture of the church,
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; the change of this body. I'm taking that
[2:15:45] very very serious. I don't want to have
[2:15:48] given these years of my life and miss
[2:15:51] that.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; And to have a prophet say, "Don't miss
[2:15:54] it."
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; Means that some possibly can miss it. I
[2:15:59] wouldn't want to have preached here as
[2:16:01] many times as I have and have people
[2:16:03] miss it. We don't want to miss it. Say,
[2:16:06] "Well, if I'm elected, I'm going to be
[2:16:07] there." Yes, that's exactly right. But
[2:16:10] you have to believe the right things.
[2:16:12] You must be a believer
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; of those things that when when Satan
[2:16:18] comes to whisper a question or a doubt
[2:16:20] and I know that looking over a
[2:16:22] congregation this size each one of your
[2:16:24] lives have been touched by somebody
[2:16:26] who's cooled off.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Isn't that true?
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; It is absolutely the true
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; and face up to it
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; and take the take the stand within
[2:16:39] yourself. Don't miss the mercy seat.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; Don't leave the mercy seat.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; And see, people cool off to the message,
[2:16:49] start questioning this, questioning
[2:16:50] that. You're leaving the mercy seat.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:56] Please tell me, please tell me how's a
[2:17:00] person going to come to the I don't care
[2:17:03] whether it's a slab in the Old Testament
[2:17:05] or the ark itself or the Torah or what
[2:17:09] form you might have it. But listen to
[2:17:12] me. I don't care how how educated you
[2:17:15] are. I don't care how smart you are. I
[2:17:17] don't care how much you've read or
[2:17:19] studied or or any of those things. I
[2:17:22] don't care how strong you are, how
[2:17:24] athletical you are, how how anything you
[2:17:28] are, but when it comes into you, just
[2:17:30] remember now. Remember, young men,
[2:17:33] remember, you're just flesh and blood.
[2:17:37] I want you to look at the mercy seat
[2:17:40] and tell me how how how does it work?
[2:17:47] How how does this function?
[2:17:50] I want to figure this out before I
[2:17:51] participate.
[2:17:55] H how do I look upon this slab?
[2:17:58] How do I look into this box?
[2:18:01] How to look upon these two tables of
[2:18:03] stone? Yeah, they said he was up in the
[2:18:04] mountain and God wrote these. I'm taking
[2:18:07] it right down. And then they say, "Well,
[2:18:11] this this fellow was born of a virgin."
[2:18:15] I don't know. How did that happen? And
[2:18:18] now somebody's saying he's he's a mercy
[2:18:20] seat.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; H how how does he he was born like I was
[2:18:24] born. Here's the cradle he was weded in.
[2:18:29] Here's the person who bore him.
[2:18:32] Mercy seat,
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; And he could say, "If you believe on me,
[2:18:35] you have eternal life. You won't die."
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; How can I believe that? M
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; and now we have a group of people here
[2:18:43] today
[2:18:46] and I'm talking to you.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; This message
[2:18:52] is the word of God. The same God
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; that has the essence of eternal life
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; has it in it.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; And it calls for one thing that you
[2:19:03] believe.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; Maybe you can't explain it.
[2:19:10] And here a brother's telling you on the
[2:19:13] authority of God's word. You you don't
[2:19:15] have to explain it.
[2:19:17] You can't understand it.
[2:19:20] You can't get your mind around it. How
[2:19:23] would the God of eternity
[2:19:27] how the God who flung the universes in
[2:19:30] place,
[2:19:32] that God
[2:19:34] is interested in me?
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:38] He wants to dwell in me.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; What kind of preposterous is this? This
[2:19:45] is the truth. This is what Jesus said.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; And we can't believe him. We can't
[2:19:50] believe anybody.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; Am I being too plain?
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; We can't believe him. We can't believe
[2:19:55] anybody. He said, "I will be in the
[2:19:58] Father, and the Father will be in me,
[2:20:00] and I will be in you." Is that correct?
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Deity will be in you. And then we have a
[2:20:06] prophet that raises up in this
[2:20:07] generation says he wants to live in you.
[2:20:10] It is him in you. Now that has happened.
[2:20:13] That's what makes this group unique.
[2:20:15] That's what makes it different is
[2:20:17] because this God is in you.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; Now if you said that just to me I say
[2:20:22] well that's nice. Thank you. Pat you on
[2:20:24] the back or I'm saying it to you. You
[2:20:26] can take it however you wish. But I'm
[2:20:28] trying to speak on the authority of that
[2:20:31] message
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; and the God of that message.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if that prophet could say
[2:20:35] that, then I feel that I can at least be
[2:20:38] an echo and echoed the same thing.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's that's the veil
[2:20:44] today. You're the veil to this world."
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; And if they tore that veil like that,
[2:20:50] we're not going to have an easy time.
[2:20:52] We're not looking for an easy time.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; We're not preaching an easy time.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; But the people of this world, they fight
[2:21:00] and struggle. We have something at least
[2:21:02] to fight and struggle for.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:20] And I saw another mighty angel
[2:21:24] come down from heaven clothed with a
[2:21:26] cloud.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; You know, all kinds of people trying to
[2:21:30] figure this out.
[2:21:34] When did it come? Well, it didn't come.
[2:21:36] Well, he wasn't there. I I was reading
[2:21:38] he's not there when this actually
[2:21:39] happened. And he didn't hunt out of
[2:21:42] season. And
[2:21:49] don't forget I said that nonsense.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Well, I can prove he was there. I can
[2:21:57] prove he can. You haven't proved
[2:21:59] anything.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; I I can prove it was by a rocket.
[2:22:07] I can prove that the winds that were
[2:22:09] blowing were Oh, you are such a smart
[2:22:12] person.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; It's amazing that you couldn't speak
[2:22:17] eternal life into somebody.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; I look down your faces. I know people
[2:22:33] talk about, "Oh, well, this one kind of
[2:22:35] cooled off and that one they're not
[2:22:36] walking we're walking with the message
[2:22:38] anymore." Who what are they walking
[2:22:40] with?
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; Who's their absolute? Where's the
[2:22:44] absolute?
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me you don't need an
[2:22:47] absolute. We need an absolute. I want an
[2:22:49] absolute. I have a right to an absolute.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; If somebody's going to say, "We have the
[2:22:54] right to eternal life." I want to know
[2:22:56] how
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; believe on him
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; whom God has sent.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:01] [Applause]
[2:23:07] And I saw another mighty angel come from
[2:23:10] come down from heaven clothed with a
[2:23:13] cloud and a rainbow was a upon his head
[2:23:18] and his face was as it were the sun and
[2:23:21] his feet as pillars of fire. Do you see
[2:23:24] this poor body here?
[2:23:29] I was sitting in that service
[2:23:34] when the prophet first showed the
[2:23:36] picture.
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; I was sitting there.
[2:23:41] My family was sitting there.
[2:23:44] Do you remember that, Linda? Do you
[2:23:46] remember sitting there? long time ago.
[2:23:51] We were sitting there and he showed that
[2:23:54] this picture
[2:23:56] held it up. But it actually
[2:24:02] is this a
[2:24:06] down here. See, this is the earth here.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; That's why they showed it in Life
[2:24:13] magazine,
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; And he's actually looking down on the
[2:24:17] earth.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:24:19] But he just and then he said there
[2:24:22] they've got it. They need to turn it to
[2:24:24] the right.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; So he just turned it and when he turned
[2:24:29] it the whole audience just gasped.
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; We all went I did too.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; He said now who do you see?
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:24:40] [Applause]
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; Glory. and I took a copy of the picture
[2:24:47] and we had a little blonde girl in in
[2:24:49] our apartment
[2:24:52] and she came in. My wife says, "Is her
[2:24:54] name Barbara?"
[2:24:56] Anyway, she's very pretty little girl
[2:24:59] about about that tall and she just came
[2:25:02] running in and I held up this picture
[2:25:04] and I said, "Who's that?" She says,
[2:25:05] "It's Jesus."
[2:25:07] I thought, "Oh, the simplicity of a
[2:25:09] child.
[2:25:11] Yeah.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; And then someone else looks at it and
[2:25:14] says, "Well, I figured out. I think
[2:25:16] there was a a rocket that they exploded
[2:25:19] over St. Ed over Edward's base in
[2:25:22] California." Yeah. Carry on. Carry on.
[2:25:25] Carry on. And when you got it all
[2:25:26] figured out, just put one great big bold
[2:25:29] letter out of it and bold dead.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; Dead. Dead. Dead.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:40] You brothers know what I'm talking
[2:25:41] about.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; We all have encyclopedias.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; I got a page out of one here.
[2:26:05] That's one page.
[2:26:09] And this whole side and down to there is
[2:26:12] on mercy.
[2:26:14] And I guarantee you'd be asleep by the
[2:26:17] time I got reading all of that.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; And I'm sorry I can't say I'm not sorry,
[2:26:22] but I'm I'm happy to let you know that
[2:26:25] when I got to the end of it, I can't say
[2:26:27] it's thus sayeth the Lord.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; But I can I can give you after these
[2:26:31] scriptures have been these scriptures to
[2:26:34] me.
[2:26:36] uh these quotes.
[2:26:39] How many sees him standing?
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; The mighty conqueror.
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Jim, thank you. You sent this to
[2:26:47] me.
[2:26:49] The word made flesh
[2:26:52] unveiled before us. We're talking about
[2:26:54] him this time. The Alpha and the Omega.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; He that was, which is, and shall come.
[2:27:02] The root and the offspring of David was
[2:27:05] the son of man,
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; the son of God,
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; son of man and will be son of David.
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; You will be with all your heart. Uh
[2:27:17] you'll
[2:27:19] you believe it with all your heart is
[2:27:21] the question. Unveiling himself in every
[2:27:24] age brought to the believer veiling
[2:27:27] himself in human flesh from the
[2:27:30] unbeliever. He is hid behind a veil. May
[2:27:34] God break every veil.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; And we see him as he is.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God break every veil.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; Every doubt that clouds your mind, may
[2:27:45] God break it.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm trying to be I'm trying to
[2:27:52] be gracious.
[2:27:57] I've been in large congre in large
[2:27:59] conventions.
[2:28:01] I know there's all kinds of trinitarians
[2:28:04] there and there may be here.
[2:28:07] Please explain for me how somebody says,
[2:28:10] "Oh, how I love Jesus." Just a moment.
[2:28:13] You stop there. But I refuse to go into
[2:28:17] this water and be baptized in his name.
[2:28:19] You do?
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; How you want to be baptized? I want to
[2:28:23] be baptized in the name of the father
[2:28:26] and of the son and of the holy ghost.
[2:28:29] Let's get real. None of those are a
[2:28:31] name.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; Who you going to be? Who you going to be
[2:28:34] baptized in? If you haven't been
[2:28:36] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:28:39] Christ, you have not been baptized. And
[2:28:42] every person in this book that was ever
[2:28:45] baptized was baptized in the name of the
[2:28:48] Lord Jesus Christ. And yet people today
[2:28:51] will bow to that and honor that and all
[2:28:54] the rest of it. And I I say you haven't
[2:28:56] got anything. And every one of you that
[2:28:59] have gone to the water to be buried with
[2:29:02] him. I love old brother Daniels and
[2:29:06] Daniel Evans his father in India. He old
[2:29:09] workhorse and he's baptizing people in
[2:29:12] the water muddy dirty water. But he are
[2:29:15] out there baptizing them. a couple of
[2:29:17] them baptizing. His son was baptizing
[2:29:20] also. And he he when he got on this
[2:29:23] subject, he said, "The father didn't die
[2:29:25] for you. The Holy Ghost didn't die for
[2:29:28] you. Jesus Christ died for you. He was
[2:29:32] buried and he raised up again.
[2:29:36] Hallelujah." And that's how he was
[2:29:38] baptizing the people. I said, "God bless
[2:29:40] that old man. He's gone on now to his
[2:29:43] reward." Hallelujah. How many people can
[2:29:46] say praise the Lord with me?
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we stand to our feet?
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; I thank you, Father, for this
[2:29:57] mercy seat.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, what mercy we have found.
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; What a glorious foundation we have
[2:30:08] found. Foundations for the families,
[2:30:11] foundation for the churches,
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; foundation, oh God, for our faith. Our
[2:30:17] faith is anchored.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; Anchored securely in the fact that it is
[2:30:22] you and none else than you. You've come
[2:30:25] on the scene in our day and in our time.
[2:30:29] Oh, it is Jesus. Yes, it is Jesus. How
[2:30:34] we thank you, Lord. I pray that you'll
[2:30:36] bless this faithful congregation of
[2:30:39] people and those that are praying for
[2:30:41] us, those that are streaming,
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; Lord. Bless this bride. Some of them we
[2:30:47] won't meet till we cross over, but we
[2:30:49] pray by your grace, by your mercy, Lord
[2:30:53] Jesus. And you're full of that grace and
[2:30:55] mercy. And we will meet with those who
[2:30:58] have gone before. We will meet with the
