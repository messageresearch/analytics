[9:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe that.
[9:27] &gt;&gt; Just thinking, you know, the commission
[9:28] that brother Brandham had, it wasn't
[9:30] just to get the people to sing songs,
[9:33] &gt;&gt; but just to get the people to believe.

[9:37] prayers. Amen. Just hold it before him
[9:39] this evening.

[9:50] grandson who's killed last night. So his
[9:52] co-orker asked for prayer.
[9:55] Uh also our sister Patty Pettingale, I
[9:58] guess she just came out of the hospital
[9:59] today. Uh she's at home. So we just want

[11:17] evening, Lord Jesus. We thank you for
[11:20] the wonderful things you have done in
[11:21] our lives thus far, Lord God. I think of
[11:24] how your prophet said, Lord, of how that
[11:28] Lord, a true worship, Lord, is just to
[11:32] present ourselves a living sacrifice. Oh
[11:34] God, Lord, it's not just with our lips,
[11:37] Lord God, with our life lived out for
[11:39] you, oh God. And Lord, we just want to

[11:43] God, just empty out of self and sin,
[11:45] Lord God. Cleanse us from every failing,
[11:48] oh God. And Lord, we come before you,
[11:51] Lord, just to ask you, Lord, for these
[11:53] special favors, Lord God. Lord, you know
[11:55] every need that was mentioned, Father,
[11:57] for our sister Karen, Lord, for her. I
[12:01] believe it was her daddy.
[12:05] I can't remember, Father, but God, you
[12:07] know each and every need, Lord Jesus.

[13:04] want to remind uh the young people that
[13:06] there's a young people service this
[13:08] Friday 7:30. So, sure you all remember,

[13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:21] Let's sing. Oh, the children of the Lord
[13:22] have a right to shout and sing. Amen.
[13:27] God's children can't shout and sing. I
[13:28] don't think anyone has a right to be
[13:30] happy about anything. Amen.
[13:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, the children of the Lord have a
[13:39] right to shout and sing. For the waves
[13:42] growing bright and our souls are on the
[13:46] way.
[13:49] We are going by to the palace of king.
[13:55] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[14:00] Yes. The children of Lord have a right
[14:04] to shout and sing for the way we're
[14:08] going right and our souls are on the
[14:11] way.
[14:13] Oh, we are going by and by to the palace
[14:18] of the king.
[14:20] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[14:40] It's a fast good oldfashioned
[14:42] uh southern gospel song and I know we
[14:45] all know it and I would trust you'll
[14:47] just join in with me on the chorus but
[14:50] it's oldfashioned and simple but it is
[14:52] my testimony.
[14:54] Praise the Lord.
[14:58] We are often tossed and driven on this
[15:03] restless sea of time. Somber skies and
[15:08] howling tempest off succeeded a bright
[15:11] sunshine. In that land of perfect
[15:16] when the mist has rolled awake, we will
[15:21] understand and fitter by and by.
[15:26] Oh,
[15:28] by and by.
[15:31] When the morning comes, when all the
[15:36] saints of God are gathered home, we will
[15:41] tell the story of how we've overcome.
[15:47] And we'll understand it better by and
[15:51] by.
[15:54] Trials dark on every hand. And I cannot
[15:59] understand
[16:01] all the way that God would lead us to
[16:04] that blessed promised land. But he
[16:08] guides me with his eyes. And I'll follow
[16:12] till I die. And I'll understand it
[16:16] better by and by
[16:23] and by.
[16:25] When the morning comes, when all the
[16:30] saints of God are gathered home,
[16:35] we'll tell a story of how we've overcome
[16:41] and we'll understand it better by and
[16:45] by.
[16:48] Temptations, hidden snares often take us
[16:53] unaware.
[16:55] And our hearts are made to flee by our
[16:59] thoughtless word and deed. And we wonder
[17:03] why the test though we try to do our
[17:07] best. And we'll understand it better by
[17:12] and by
[17:17] and by.
[17:19] When the morning comes, when all the
[17:24] saints
[17:25] of God come together at home, we'll tell
[17:30] the story of how we've overcome.
[17:35] And we'll understand it better by and
[17:39] by.
[17:41] Oh
[17:43] by and by.
[17:46] When the morning comes, when all the
[17:51] saints of God are gathered home, we'll
[17:56] tell the story
[17:59] of how we overcome.
[18:02] And we'll understand it better by and
[18:06] by.
[18:08] Oh
[18:10] my and by.
[18:13] When the morning comes,
[18:16] when all the shame of God are gather,
[18:23] we'll tell the story of how we've
[18:27] overcome.
[18:29] And we'll understand it better. We'll
[18:34] understand it better.
[18:36] We'll understand it better. flying by.
[18:45] Thank you Jesus. Give him praise. Thank
[18:47] you Lord. Thank you Lord.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; Let's sing at the cross. At the cross
[19:02] where I first saw the light. Amen. The
[19:05] light's still shining this evening in
[19:06] our hearts.
[19:12] Oh, at the cross, at the cross, where I
[19:16] first saw the light and the burdens of
[19:20] my heart roll away.
[19:24] Oh, it was there by I received my side
[19:31] and now I am happy all day. First verse.
[19:37] The last hand is my savior.
[19:43] And in my sovereign God
[19:49] would he
[19:52] s
[20:00] oh cross that cross is where I burn saw
[20:06] light and the burnings of my heart roll
[20:11] way.

[20:34] the tree.
[20:37] Amazing.

[21:10] day.
[21:13] Well might the sun in God is high and
[21:20] shine his glory.
[21:25] And Christ the mighty mater.
[21:36] Oh, and the rock and roll where I saw
[21:43] and the bird of my heart roll away.
[21:49] It was there by faith. I receive my son
[21:55] and now I am happy all day.
[22:00] But drops of rain can
[22:07] the debt of the high.
[22:12] Dear Lord, I give myself
[22:17] away is all that I can do.
[22:24] Oh, and cross and cross where I burst
[22:29] all
[22:30] and the burdens of my heart go away.
[22:36] It was there by me. I received my son
[22:42] and now I am happy all the day. Amen.
[22:48] Are you thankful that your burdens
[22:49] rolled away?
[22:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to pick them up
[22:52] tomorrow morning. They're gone in the
[22:54] sea of God's forgetfulness. Amen.
[22:58] Like to sing the chorus of blessed
[22:59] assurance just as we turn the service
[23:01] over to brother Ed.
[23:04] as we do. I just uh
[23:09] I don't know how many people noticed it,
[23:11] but the song service is a little
[23:12] different in that every song we've sang
[23:15] tonight was written by one person,
[23:18] Banny Crosby.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; I was just I read a little uh life story
[23:24] of her on Sunday and it touched my
[23:26] heart.
[23:28] Brother Brandham spoke of her many
[23:30] times.
[23:32] Just amazing what one person yielded to
[23:35] God
[23:36] &gt;&gt; can do just bring us into the presence
[23:38] of the Lord.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's many times he spoke
[23:46] what do you think of Jesus?
[23:49] He said what do you think Penny Crosby?
[23:51] What do you think of this Christ?
[23:54] And she panned pass me not. Oh gentle
[23:56] savior
[23:58] hear my humble cry.
[24:01] While on others thou art calling.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[24:09] think of it.

[24:13] earth beside thee? Whom in heaven but
[24:16] thee?
[24:18] &gt;&gt; Friends, we're looking to one tonight.

[24:23] word.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; He's here to meet our needs. Amen.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; As the ministry comes forth, it'll just
[24:29] touch our hearts. Heal the sick, touch,
[24:33] save the lost soul. Amen.

[28:33] &gt;&gt; Well, we're so thankful to be back in
[28:36] the house of God locally here to hear
[28:40] the singing and the worship and to know
[28:43] that we're ready to hear the word. Amen.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Coming to church tonight, we listen to
[28:48] the brothers when the men sang, "I know
[28:51] his voice."
[28:52] &gt;&gt; And as far as I'm concerned, you can
[28:54] sing that again for me. That's just
[28:57] lovely. Amen. Glad we know his voice.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here.
[29:03] just got a excuse me, just got a uh
[29:08] uh word from brother Gido in Belgium and
[29:12] he just wanted to let us know because he
[29:15] just received his visa for Siberia
[29:18] and he is he will be going to Siberia.
[29:21] He's uh setting all the things in place
[29:24] now. uh he he's going to the capital of
[29:28] Siberia this time and many of the
[29:30] children that he visited in the far
[29:33] reaches of s northern part of Siberia
[29:36] and Siberia is north but the northern
[29:38] part he visited those uh orphanages over
[29:42] these years and these orphan children
[29:44] now have grown into adults and many of
[29:47] them are in the cap they're there
[29:51] working so he's contacted them and he's
[29:53] going to be with them. And so, let's
[29:56] just pray that God will give them a
[29:58] gracious time. Uh, you know, I'm sure
[30:00] it's not a it's not a simple matter for
[30:02] them to try to live uh the life that
[30:06] that he's he's taught them to and and
[30:08] that the word teaches and we don't know
[30:11] how how uh how much available the
[30:14] message is to them. But I but brother Go
[30:17] asked us if we'd remember to pray for
[30:18] him.
[30:20] Also, brother Deepak Titus, he's uh he's
[30:25] probably uh streaming tonight. He and
[30:27] his wife and two children immigrated
[30:31] from India. I know brother Dpac's
[30:34] father. He's a pastor, wonderful pastor
[30:37] in India. They stream quite a few of our
[30:39] meetings as well. And uh Brother Deepac
[30:43] has an uncle in Winnipeg who sponsored
[30:47] him to come to Canada. and they just
[30:50] arrived uh about three weeks ago.
[30:52] They're in Winnipeg now and uh they
[30:55] consider that as a as a just a a
[30:59] stopping place for the time being. They
[31:01] expect to be here, Lord willing, end of
[31:04] June. They really need to spend about 2
[31:07] 3 months there because they were
[31:09] sponsored there under a certain program.
[31:12] But he wants to come here and he's very
[31:14] very well educated in um in uh technical
[31:19] uh engineering. Uh he has taught in the
[31:22] colleges and universities in India. And
[31:25] so we're hoping that uh well we believe
[31:28] that God will give him a place and a
[31:29] position here. God's never never left us
[31:32] out on a limb, has he?
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? And he said their
[31:37] their only desire, I mean their only
[31:39] desire, he said they just are yearning
[31:41] to be in the fellowship. They want to be
[31:43] here. And while they've streamed it, to
[31:46] them it's not quite good enough. And uh
[31:49] so we're we want you to really welcome
[31:53] them when they come. And uh we're we're
[31:56] attempting to have a place for them to
[31:59] uh to live in just for a time being
[32:02] until they get kind of settled. But they
[32:04] want to be it. It's wonderful when you
[32:05] have people that come from so far and
[32:08] the only thing they got in their mind is
[32:10] we want to be in the fellowship. We've
[32:13] seen the people but we want to be there.
[32:14] We want to be a part of it. We want our
[32:17] children in the school. And those are
[32:18] the two main things on their mind. And
[32:21] the third thing is a job just enough to
[32:23] keep us uh alive. I think God will honor
[32:26] that.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know he will. Amen. Others have
[32:30] been calling all all in just two days.
[32:33] in fact is quite a bit today. Others are
[32:35] calling and uh we got a we got a request
[32:39] from Africa they a couple while I was
[32:43] there a family there has been witnessing
[32:46] to a Chinese family and they're
[32:48] interested in the message and they just
[32:50] didn't know
[32:52] you know uh h how how much more to
[32:55] approach them or how they can approach
[32:57] them and when I was able to tell them
[33:00] we've got a whole website with the
[33:02] messages translated and they can hear
[33:05] brother Brandham's voice with the voice
[33:07] over uh brother Murphy speaking the
[33:10] message. They were just thrilled. So
[33:13] they just right away got it on email
[33:15] today. What is that website? We we want
[33:18] to get our people onto that website
[33:19] right away. I tell you friends,
[33:22] God hasn't done this in a corner.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; It's just all it's just all over. Uh I
[33:29] read today there are those that are so
[33:32] opposed to the message. I read some and
[33:35] uh you know that we were in brother
[33:36] Brandham's meetings and and then they go
[33:38] on with all of their I will call it
[33:40] nonsense because that's what it is and
[33:42] never really quote him.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; You know, never really say what he said,
[33:47] but say what they think he said. Oh, I'm
[33:50] so glad for the word of God and what
[33:52] it's done for you and I. Amen. And so,
[33:55] we're going to go turn to the
[33:57] scriptures, but just before we do, let's
[34:00] just bow once more in prayer. Father, uh
[34:03] we have spoken about brother Gido and we
[34:06] we ask as a congregation that you will
[34:09] be very very near to him that you will
[34:12] guide every footstep. Go with he and
[34:15] brother Dennis his uh interpreter as
[34:17] they make their way Lord from spot to
[34:20] spot from station to station from city
[34:23] to city from orphanage to orphanage. I
[34:25] think of those children, Lord Jesus. And
[34:27] when you were here, you took the time,
[34:30] you set the adults aside and you drew
[34:33] the children to yourself and you said,
[34:36] you said that they were blessed. And I
[34:38] pray, Lord, that that uh I know that
[34:40] even now these children that have not
[34:43] mother nor father and have not anything
[34:46] of this world's goods. And Lord, the
[34:50] future is bleak. But here comes brother
[34:52] G with a testimony of a Lord Jesus that
[34:56] loves children. And I pray that you will
[34:58] speak to their hearts and touch them,
[35:00] Lord, even as you touch my own heart as
[35:03] a child. Oh God, I pray that you will
[35:06] just so anoint him and give him a give
[35:08] him a a series of uh meetings this time
[35:11] such as he's never had before in the
[35:14] name of Jesus Christ. Be with our
[35:16] brother Deepac, Lord, and his sister and
[35:18] his wife, Sister Vanana. And I pray,
[35:20] Lord, that you will make a way for them,
[35:22] oh God, as they're looking to you and
[35:24] others that have called and we said we
[35:26] would remember them in prayer. I pray,
[35:28] Father, that you will be very near them.
[35:30] And now, Lord, anoint as the word is uh
[35:33] the message has already been blessed by
[35:35] prayer, our brother Mike praying. I
[35:37] pray, Father, that as I stand at the
[35:39] post of duty, you'll just anoint us and
[35:42] touch us physically and spiritually in
[35:44] every way. In Jesus Christ's name we ask
[35:46] it. Amen. Amen. God bless you for
[35:49] standing. Turn if you would to uh second
[35:52] Peter. And I would like with God's help
[35:56] to
[35:57] perhaps just lay some foundation uh this
[36:00] evening uh for for Sunday. And uh Lord
[36:05] willing,
[36:07] I'll be speaking Sunday morning. You
[36:09] want to pray for my voice? I've been
[36:11] having some increased trouble with my
[36:14] throat and I just don't know what the
[36:17] answer is. I know who causes it.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; D with a capital D.
[36:24] The devil.
[36:28] You're agreeing with me, are you? All
[36:30] right. That's good. That's good. I
[36:31] needed some agreement.
[36:34] So, if you want to say sickum tonight,
[36:36] well, you you just go ahead and that'll
[36:37] help me along.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; We're going to read from the 15th verse
[36:43] of the chapter one of Second Peter.
[36:45] Moreover, I will endeavor that ye will
[36:48] that you may be able after my decease
[36:52] to have these things always in
[36:54] remembrance. For we have not followed
[36:56] cunningly devised fables when we made
[36:59] known unto you the power and coming of
[37:01] our Lord Jesus Christ. Uh but where
[37:05] eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he
[37:08] received from God the Father honor and
[37:11] glory when there came such a voice to
[37:13] him from the excellent glory. This is my
[37:16] beloved son in whom I'm well pleased.
[37:19] And this voice which came from heaven.
[37:22] We heard when we were with him in the
[37:25] holy mount. We have also a more sure
[37:28] word of prophecy where unto you do well
[37:31] that you take heed as unto a light that
[37:34] shineth in a dark place until the day
[37:37] dawn and the day star rise in your
[37:39] hearts. Knowing this first that no
[37:42] prophecy of the scripture is of any
[37:44] private interpretation.
[37:46] For the prophecy came not in old time by
[37:48] the will of man, but holy men of God
[37:51] spake as they were moved by the Holy
[37:54] Ghost. You may be seated and keep your
[37:57] Bibles handy and ready if you would
[37:59] please.
[38:01] I I'd like you to notice the last verse
[38:04] which we just read. For the prophecy
[38:08] came not in old time by the will of man.
[38:12] But holy men of God spake as they were
[38:16] moved by the Holy Ghost. Uh I I want to
[38:22] take a thought moved by the power of
[38:26] life.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said there's only two
[38:29] powers in the world and that is the
[38:34] power of life and the power of of death.
[38:39] Only God and Satan. That's only two. He
[38:42] said we have wars and uprisings and all
[38:45] kinds of conflicts. People rise against
[38:48] people, nation against nation, all kinds
[38:52] of of of things taking place throughout
[38:55] the entire world. We hear of it. We
[38:58] become accustomed to it. But always
[39:00] remember, he said only two powers.
[39:04] Only two powers. All humanity,
[39:09] six billion
[39:11] of us because we are part of that
[39:13] community. And every person in this
[39:16] building and under the sound of my voice
[39:19] is directed by one of those two.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; There is no in between.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; It's either God directing us or Satan
[39:28] directing us.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; And I realize we can be, you know, under
[39:33] we can be as sons and daughters of God
[39:35] and we're being guided by the the Holy
[39:38] Spirit. And I realize we can, you know,
[39:40] uh, perhaps take a detour and and get
[39:43] sidetracked and all of those things, but
[39:46] I I want to, uh, have you be thinking
[39:48] with me and remember the scriptures that
[39:51] we use tonight and that you'll keep them
[39:53] in mind, bear them in mind these next
[39:55] days until Sunday. And so we want to
[39:58] enlarge on them, the Lord willing. But I
[40:01] want to think about this uh this aspect
[40:04] of being motivated because we are all
[40:07] are motivated. We're moved by something
[40:10] and we we understand that term that
[40:12] terminology. It's it's a common term to
[40:15] us today. Uh we hear of motivational
[40:18] speakers and people that are highly
[40:21] motivated and people that are not
[40:23] motivated. At least they don't think
[40:25] they're motivated. But even if a person
[40:28] thinks they're not motivated, they are
[40:31] being they are being driven by
[40:33] something. Some people might be driven
[40:36] more slowly than others. Some are very
[40:39] very highly motivated people and we can
[40:43] say they're driven. They're driven for
[40:45] something. People are driven for a lot
[40:47] of different things. You know, during
[40:49] the gold rush it was gold fever. That's
[40:52] what they called it. But you should see
[40:54] the documentaries I've seen, you know,
[40:56] many years ago and seen these men and
[40:59] they had camels up in this country. Did
[41:01] you know that they had camels in this
[41:03] country walking in the snow? They had
[41:06] donkeys and everything else and the men
[41:08] packing things on their backs. You talk
[41:11] about being driven, hoping and expecting
[41:13] that, you know, they're going to get
[41:15] rich and they call it gold fever.
[41:18] There's all kinds of fevers. I want to
[41:20] believe that tonight and as I pondered
[41:22] this subject and thought about it for
[41:24] the last number of days, even while I
[41:26] was away, I trust that we could be a
[41:28] people that have a message fever
[41:32] &gt;&gt; driven driven by a spirit that brought
[41:37] the message and that we would have a
[41:39] message fever.
[41:42] There's there's a a a myriad of things
[41:45] today that motivate people and I want to
[41:49] just name some of them off so from our
[41:53] just our natural uh uh surroundings but
[41:57] a a motive now a motive is that which
[42:01] incites
[42:02] motion or action. If you have a motive,
[42:06] it incites
[42:09] motion or action. And a motive is also
[42:13] having power to move or to cause motion.
[42:19] That's having a motive.
[42:22] A motive may signify
[42:26] either a mental impulse or something
[42:30] external, an object that you see or a
[42:33] desire that you have so that it induces
[42:37] or causes action.
[42:41] I want you to hold that. Now the Bible
[42:45] is a record
[42:47] of highly motivated people.
[42:51] Both men and women have been driven by
[42:56] something that even they could not
[42:59] understand.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that if the
[43:03] prophets had known what it was they were
[43:05] saying, they would have in no way said
[43:07] it.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; They didn't understand what they were
[43:10] saying. They many times did not do not
[43:14] know what they were doing. They couldn't
[43:16] understand their actions. Brother
[43:18] Brandam says, "I believe it is in things
[43:20] that are to be." He said, "You know,
[43:22] when uh like when we're children, we
[43:24] don't uh the things that of of adult
[43:27] life and the things that our parents and
[43:30] adults do seem so mysterious to you. But
[43:33] when you get of age and you enter into
[43:36] adulthood yourself, then you look back
[43:38] and you see that that it it it all makes
[43:41] it all fit so well. It all makes so much
[43:44] sense. When we're a child, we thought of
[43:46] a child. Thought as a child, we act as a
[43:49] children as children. But when when we
[43:51] get older, then we understand the things
[43:54] that were such a mystery. And he said,
[43:56] he said, you know, you it might look
[43:58] like a a mystery. It was so mysterious
[44:00] at the time. You you kind of stumbled
[44:03] into a a little building and and heard
[44:06] the gospel. And he said, just fell right
[44:09] down at the altar and gave your life to
[44:12] Christ. And it all seems so mysterious,
[44:14] but something was driving you.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; And it's either life or death.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; It's either the power of life or death
[44:25] that is causing an impulse within us to
[44:29] do what we do.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, it's not something
[44:33] that's just a flash in the pan. It's
[44:36] it's something this motivation that I'm
[44:38] speaking of is something that is so
[44:41] consistent. It is it's continuous. It's
[44:45] not something that's a big boom here and
[44:47] a shotgun there and and then nothing in
[44:49] between. You know, it's something that
[44:52] is consistent and it keeps moving a
[44:54] person forward. Sometimes faster than
[44:57] other times, but we're moving forward.
[44:59] We go in the same direction week after
[45:01] week and month after month and year
[45:03] after year. and you see a person years
[45:05] later and they're just the same, only
[45:07] they're further down the road. They're
[45:09] more established, more stronger in their
[45:13] faith and in what they believe, they've
[45:15] not changed one bit because that's
[45:17] really the power that I'm talking about
[45:20] tonight.
[45:22] Some of the things that people are
[45:24] motivated by today or that motivate
[45:28] people today and and some of these
[45:31] things you may you know have thought of
[45:34] no doubt have thought of but I want to
[45:36] just focus on them a wee bit. The media
[45:38] and advertising is is a huge huge
[45:42] industry and it's it's out there today
[45:46] in every newspaper and every magazine
[45:49] and every kind of form of of media
[45:51] whether it radio or television or
[45:53] internet or whatever more. It's out
[45:55] there to motivate you to spend your
[45:58] money.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; And if you haven't got money, use your
[46:04] credit card.
[46:06] And if you don't have a credit card,
[46:08] borrow from a bank. Do something, but
[46:12] spend some money.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; That's the name of the game, friends.
[46:18] Oh, you might be quiet, but that's all
[46:20] right. I'm going to preach it anyway.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; It motivates. It's there to motivate
[46:25] people and it entices it. You see it in
[46:28] the eyes and you hear it in the ears and
[46:31] my, it looks so wonderful. And there's
[46:34] only 1.9% interest. And mine I And you
[46:37] can have it right now. And you don't
[46:39] have to pay anything for 12 months.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Fill your house full of furniture. You
[46:45] don't have to pay a penny. Don't tell me
[46:48] that you haven't got an impulse.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh my, it's just the right color
[46:52] and it's the right everything and I just
[46:54] think I need it." you know,
[46:57] &gt;&gt; hey, this whole industry, you think
[47:00] there's people that are scheming right
[47:02] now while you and I are sitting here,
[47:03] they're working in their little uh
[47:06] offices and they're at their drafting
[47:07] board and they're trying to draw uh
[47:11] they're scheming at drawing the sleek
[47:13] lines of next year's automobiles.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; What are they trying to do? Their intent
[47:20] is when that thing hits the hits the
[47:22] magazine, you're going to see it and
[47:25] say, "Oh, wow. I got to have that."
[47:29] &gt;&gt; And they say, "Just what we figured.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; That's just what we planned." What have
[47:35] they done? They've motivated you
[47:38] &gt;&gt; by what you've seen. And and it it's
[47:40] it's it's it's given you a motivation.
[47:43] It's to persuade you. And furthermore,
[47:47] brother brother Brand tells, you know,
[47:49] some of these things sounds real real
[47:50] simple, but he heard an ad or uh saw an
[47:54] ad or something of this soap.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; You remember
[47:58] &gt;&gt; the soap just does it by itself.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; You don't have to do anything. You just
[48:04] put the dishes and you use this soap.
[48:06] You put the dishes in. You bring them
[48:08] out. They're just sparkling, squeaky
[48:10] clean.
[48:12] And so he said to his wife, "Let me do
[48:14] the dishes.
[48:16] I got some of this stuff. This is just
[48:19] magic." Put it in there. Put that old
[48:21] dirty dish with all the dried egg on it.
[48:24] Brought it out. It was just the same. He
[48:26] said, "That's a fraud.
[48:29] That's not true." But you see, what
[48:31] they're wanting to do is cause you to
[48:34] believe that what they're saying is the
[48:37] truth.
[48:39] is the truth. And if you are persuaded
[48:43] that it's the truth, then they if they
[48:46] can make you believe that's the truth,
[48:48] then you'll have an impulse to buy it.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Now, what about religion?
[48:56] &gt;&gt; If they can make you believe that this
[48:59] doctrine or what they have is absolute
[49:02] truth, who doesn't want truth? We want
[49:04] truth.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; We want the truth. and to say, "Oh, it
[49:09] sounds truth and it looks true and I
[49:13] think I'll believe it." And there you
[49:15] are. And it swallows people up. And that
[49:18] is why that is why a prophet would need
[49:20] to come with a thus sayeth the Lord. So
[49:23] that uh there'll be a people that will
[49:26] appeal to that or that that will appeal
[49:29] to them and they'll say I don't
[49:31] understand it and I don't know why I'm
[49:34] hitting the altar and I don't know why
[49:37] I'm surrendering my life and I don't
[49:39] know why exactly my mind is is trying to
[49:42] do gymnastics with it but somehow deep
[49:46] in my inner man, my inner being, my soul
[49:50] is saying yay.
[49:53] Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; It's an impulse
[49:59] &gt;&gt; that you're having and it's
[50:02] &gt;&gt; life.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Life is pulsating.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; I think of patriotism. I'm not trying to
[50:12] preach on these things now. I just want
[50:14] to go over a few. I think of patriotism.
[50:18] People become patriotic
[50:21] and they become very fervent. They
[50:24] become patriotic to the point I'm
[50:26] willing to give my life for my country
[50:29] and for the cause that my government
[50:31] puts forward and I believe in what
[50:34] they're saying and I'm going to join the
[50:36] force and I'm going to go I'm going to
[50:38] go and fight. I'm going to give my life
[50:40] and they do.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Many of them do for patriotism. They're
[50:44] motivated by patriotism. Others have a
[50:47] cause. Uh there's causes of there for
[50:50] for poverty. Uh for uh cancer uh no the
[50:57] world knows of of Terry the Terry Fox
[51:00] run. Terry Fox the boy from over here on
[51:03] the other side of the river Kquitlam or
[51:05] north uh Port Kquitlam I believe it was
[51:08] whichever. And and they have Terry Fox
[51:10] runs now all over the world. One boy
[51:14] running with an artificial leg across
[51:17] Canada. Didn't quite make it, but he ran
[51:20] he ran hundreds and hundreds of miles,
[51:22] thousands miles. I forget he made about
[51:25] 3/4 of the way across and then and then
[51:27] died. But it caught
[51:30] &gt;&gt; it caught the imagination of people and
[51:33] people that have to run. He I think he I
[51:36] think he brought in around $20 million
[51:38] in his run for cancer and and and he
[51:42] gave him a name in history, but it
[51:44] motivated people and people all over the
[51:47] world want to run in the Terry Fox run.
[51:50] One man, you know, he he caught their
[51:53] imagination. There's people today where,
[51:56] you know, they're motivated for AIDS and
[51:58] they're motivated. They do all kinds of
[52:00] things. And the streets of many cities
[52:02] in America in the last week have been
[52:05] filled with hundreds of thousands of
[52:07] people. Hundreds of thousands of people
[52:09] because they're motivated on the on the
[52:12] immigration issue and who should be
[52:14] allowed immigration and and these that
[52:16] the government is called illegal. What
[52:19] would we do without them? Our country
[52:21] needs them. Our our industry needs them.
[52:23] And everybody has a cause. Everybody has
[52:27] an issue. But people are motivated by
[52:29] it. You can't say they're not motivated.
[52:32] Something pulsates in them and they're
[52:34] not ashamed to get out in front and you
[52:36] know here we got a message.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Don't hold it back. Are you ashamed of
[52:41] it? They they get out there their
[52:43] banners and right in front of the
[52:44] cameras and hold it up. We got a cause.
[52:47] We're motivated. We we got to if they
[52:50] got a cause, it's just a just something
[52:52] for time. What about you got eternal
[52:55] life? Amen.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Man said he was an atheist. I wish I had
[53:01] it. I could read it for you because it
[53:03] puts most of most believers to shame
[53:06] really in one way. But he says, "If I
[53:09] really believed that there was a hell
[53:11] that burned and people were going to be
[53:14] tormented
[53:15] and my friends were and the people I
[53:18] work with, etc. And if I really believed
[53:20] there was a place of such bliss as as
[53:23] Christianity says, heaven. And if I
[53:26] really believed that this was eternal
[53:29] life, and this was, of course, he
[53:31] thought that was eternal damnation. But
[53:33] he said, "If I really believe that,
[53:35] there'd be no ocean too wide. There'd be
[53:38] no mountain too steep. There'd be no
[53:41] cold too severe. There'd be no desert
[53:44] too hot. There'd be no place there'd be
[53:46] no hardship." And he could see himself
[53:49] giving everything in in in absolute
[53:52] fanatical surrender. What's he saying?
[53:55] I'd be motivated if I really believed
[53:57] that.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; We aren't all motivated the same way,
[54:07] but we should be all motivated by the
[54:09] same thing.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; And that's the Holy Spirit. And the Holy
[54:12] Spirit is life. Life is motivating us
[54:14] on. And we don't change.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What we are today motivates
[54:19] us tomorrow and we have a good time, it
[54:22] still motivates us through. We have a
[54:24] bad time, that has nothing to do with
[54:25] that. Things go sideways, things go up,
[54:28] things go in reverse, things go
[54:30] absolutely, people turn against us. That
[54:32] has nothing to do with it.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; We're motivated
[54:36] &gt;&gt; by a power and it's a power of life.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Our own human reasoning
[54:47] can motivate people. They come to a
[54:49] certain determination.
[54:51] The influence of another person can
[54:54] motivate someone say, "I think you
[54:56] should do this." And they do it. And as
[54:58] I said, religion and the millions that
[55:00] give their lives for the cause.
[55:03] And last but not least, the Holy Ghost
[55:07] motivates people.
[55:10] I was reading in the scripture. It's
[55:12] Acts the 10th chapter. We won't
[55:14] necessarily turn to it just now, but
[55:16] perhaps on Sunday if you wish to read
[55:19] it. Acts the 10th chapter.
[55:21] And it's really striking in the light of
[55:24] this thought that I'm bringing to you.
[55:28] Peter, who's been brought up in strict
[55:32] teaching of the law, that's all they've
[55:35] known. He he he is a uh he's been taught
[55:40] by his parents. He's a Jew taught in
[55:44] there all the precepts of Judaism. We've
[55:48] been brought up to like you have as
[55:50] you've been brought up.
[55:54] And he sees in the vision a sheet coming
[55:56] down all kinds of creeping animals and
[55:58] different things. Creeping things and
[56:00] animals on there, clean and unclean, I
[56:02] guess. And and a voice says to him,
[56:05] "Rise up." and eat. He said, "Nothing
[56:09] unclean has ever touched my lips. I I've
[56:12] never eaten anything unclean." And it
[56:14] happens three times.
[56:17] That has such an effect on him. And then
[56:21] the voice says to him, "Arise,
[56:25] there's men at the door." And he goes
[56:27] down to those men. And those three men
[56:30] have been sent by Cornelius who's a
[56:32] centurion of the band of the Italian
[56:35] called the Italian band. So he's over a
[56:38] hundred men of the Italian band. And
[56:41] they're saying
[56:45] a devout man, Cornelius, a centurion,
[56:47] has sent us for you to come there. Now
[56:51] he's just told the Lord, he said, "I've
[56:53] never allowed anything unclean to touch
[56:56] to touch my lips." and he knows what it
[56:58] is. Now, now he's being called to go to
[57:01] these Gentiles. And furthermore, he's a
[57:04] he he's a a soldier. He's an officer of
[57:08] the army that has got Israel under under
[57:12] its iron hand.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; He says, "Go to him."
[57:17] And now
[57:20] the power of of that spirit that is an
[57:24] anointing him, the power of it is
[57:27] stronger than his teaching all the way
[57:31] from childhood. The precepts from from
[57:34] babyhood up to manhood, it just
[57:38] disappears.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; That's powerful. That's real motivation.
[57:43] Now, he didn't go up and j dance and
[57:45] have a whole bunch of there's no emotion
[57:47] attached to it at all. He just now he's
[57:50] moved by a quiet deep
[57:53] &gt;&gt; power.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't understand it. And they
[57:58] spend the next day traveling and he
[58:00] comes to Cornelius's house. Cornelius
[58:02] has been moved. He's he he he's
[58:05] motivated to call for this man. And I
[58:08] see there's there's such a a a merging
[58:12] together. Now, we read it like a story,
[58:14] but it's a whole lot more than a story,
[58:16] friends, because there was a whole lot
[58:17] more to it. This man, this man Peter
[58:20] especially had had all of his religious
[58:24] precepts displaced. Now, he had already
[58:26] received the Holy Spirit on the day of
[58:29] Pentecost, but nothing was said that he
[58:31] was going to lay all of this aside. But
[58:34] that one experience of God is so real
[58:39] that he can not escape it. And not only
[58:42] that, but when when God gives it to him,
[58:46] he actually knows what it means. You
[58:48] know,
[58:51] that's why people come into services
[58:54] such as tonight, Sunday. People who know
[58:58] nothing but the message.
[59:00] They don't even know what you're talking
[59:02] about. People who know very little about
[59:04] the scripture, they'll come into a
[59:06] meeting and a minister might be into the
[59:09] depths of the word preaching for with
[59:11] all the force and and and the richness
[59:14] that God has given him for the people.
[59:17] And somebody will sit there who's an
[59:19] absolutely ignorant of all spiritual
[59:21] things, but he understands or she
[59:23] perfectly what you're saying and they
[59:25] have an interpretation because it it
[59:28] ministers to them and they see
[59:30] themselves and they see exactly what
[59:32] they're supposed to do and they're
[59:34] motivated by it.
[59:37] and say, "You told my whole life." Maybe
[59:40] there was really nothing in it that
[59:42] related to them. But when God does it,
[59:45] it just shows exactly what you're
[59:47] supposed to do.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[59:53] &gt;&gt; So now, the scripture that we read said
[59:54] that the holy men of God, they spake
[1:00:01] as they were moved. Yes, sir.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; By the Holy Ghost. And this word moved.
[1:00:12] It isn't that just that they had an
[1:00:14] impulse, but this particular word is to
[1:00:18] bear. You're like you're carrying
[1:00:21] something. You're to bear or bring
[1:00:24] forth. And I want to not want you to
[1:00:27] notice the the different places that
[1:00:29] it's used in the scriptures. We'll be
[1:00:30] able to use our Bibles in just a moment.
[1:00:33] So now it's to carry some burden. It
[1:00:36] says in Malachi, the burden of the word
[1:00:40] of the Lord. Not the burden of the
[1:00:43] prophet Malachi, but the burden of the
[1:00:46] word of the Lord.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; You're a believer of the message.
[1:00:51] You believe and you have certain things
[1:00:54] that you hold dear
[1:00:58] to actually bring those out. to bring
[1:01:02] those out as the Holy Spirit intends to
[1:01:04] bring them out in the in the in the
[1:01:08] place that you live to hold it forth as
[1:01:11] a testimony. It actually comes as a
[1:01:14] burden.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; It's a weight.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; It's something you're carrying.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; It's not some light flippant thing, but
[1:01:23] it's something that is is weighty. It's
[1:01:26] heavy,
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; and you're bearing it. You're carrying
[1:01:29] it. you're bringing it forth
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; and there's a responsibility with it.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; It has to be carried with a certain kind
[1:01:39] of a a a dignity or spiritual integrity.
[1:01:44] It's carried. It's not something you
[1:01:45] know when God entrusted this to us. It
[1:01:48] wasn't a light matter.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; It's not something that we that that's
[1:01:55] why I I get burdened. I was today when I
[1:02:01] look over the country and and see and
[1:02:03] and sometimes such a evil report comes
[1:02:07] on the message and I feel it's
[1:02:08] unnecessary.
[1:02:10] it wasn't really necessary. And then you
[1:02:12] have to say, "Well, God, you know,
[1:02:15] maybe, you know, uh there's been those
[1:02:17] that have embraced the message, turn
[1:02:19] away from it." To me, you know what they
[1:02:22] did? They stood right on the path that
[1:02:24] Jesus walked by. And as he walked by,
[1:02:27] they put lashes on his back.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; It's exactly what they did.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; They lashed him as he walked by and
[1:02:34] wounded his body and brought evil report
[1:02:39] on him. a false report. And I and I and
[1:02:42] I it breaks my heart when I see
[1:02:45] something like that. We have been
[1:02:46] entrusted because God believes in you.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, God trusted Job. I
[1:02:54] believe he's trusted. If you are a
[1:02:56] believer and he's given you what he's
[1:02:58] given you, then God has trusted you with
[1:03:01] it. Amen. And that should move us and
[1:03:04] motivate us to hold it with a real
[1:03:07] respect and hold it with an integrity.
[1:03:10] Say, I'll not deny it.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll not bring it down. I'll
[1:03:14] hold it up. I have an impulse within me
[1:03:18] to hold it high. Hallelujah.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; And so that's what it was within these
[1:03:29] prophets. Now, the Bible tells us I I I
[1:03:33] haven't wanted to turn to it, but I'm
[1:03:35] going to turn to it. Um,
[1:03:38] in First Peter,
[1:03:54] I believe I have it here.
[1:04:04] First Peter
[1:04:07] uh
[1:04:10] verse 10,
[1:04:13] of which salvation, now notice it's
[1:04:15] talking about the prophets again, of
[1:04:18] which salvation the prophets have
[1:04:19] inquired
[1:04:21] and searched diligently.
[1:04:24] Oh, I wish we could see them tonight.
[1:04:26] see those men of God, holy prophets of
[1:04:29] old, inquiring, searching diligently.
[1:04:33] You know, they just didn't walk over to
[1:04:34] the neighbor's house or they didn't turn
[1:04:36] on a radio. They didn't have any of
[1:04:37] that. It was year after year. They
[1:04:40] searched the scriptures and poured back
[1:04:42] and forth over the scriptures, searching
[1:04:45] it by their candle light, searching
[1:04:48] diligently, seeking. And they said, and
[1:04:51] and they inquired and searched
[1:04:53] diligently who prophesied. They had
[1:04:56] prophesied of the grace that should come
[1:04:58] unto you searching what or what manner
[1:05:01] of time the spirit of Christ notice the
[1:05:05] spirit of Christ which was in them did
[1:05:09] signify when it that's the spirit of
[1:05:12] Christ when it testified beforehand of
[1:05:16] the sufferings of Christ and the glory
[1:05:18] that should follow. Now here's these men
[1:05:21] just get you can look up now. Here's
[1:05:23] these men, holy men, godly men, men who
[1:05:28] you'd love to have in your home, men who
[1:05:30] you'd love to have as your neighbor, as
[1:05:33] your confidant, as someone you could
[1:05:35] talk to, holy men of God. And the spirit
[1:05:39] which was in them did signify of the
[1:05:42] sufferings of Christ and the glory which
[1:05:45] should follow. And and it was in them.
[1:05:47] And they were inquiring. They were
[1:05:49] wanting to determine when is this going
[1:05:51] to be? How is this going to happen? And
[1:05:54] and God held it from them
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; to make it known
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; at a later time and to other people and
[1:06:02] to another generation. And I can tell
[1:06:05] you uh without a shadow of a doubt in my
[1:06:09] mind that the apostles
[1:06:12] the apostles would love to have seen
[1:06:15] what you see today.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; They would love to have lived in this
[1:06:19] time. And quite frankly, I think they'd
[1:06:22] tear the country up.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, I think some of them be
[1:06:26] thrown in jail
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; because they would not be able to hold
[1:06:30] their peace.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; And we we might well be getting ready
[1:06:37] for who knows what the future is. We're
[1:06:40] not going to be considered nicer people
[1:06:42] all the time. There's going to be a
[1:06:44] spiritual, as I said, an integrity that
[1:06:46] that the world cannot deny. But Jesus
[1:06:50] said, "The world will hate you."
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; They will hate you because there's only
[1:06:56] two powers in the world. It's Satan and
[1:06:59] God. And Satan hates God. And if you
[1:07:01] have God in you, you're going to be
[1:07:03] hated
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; by the world.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:11] Now you can also take your Bibles
[1:07:15] and uh this being moved by the Holy
[1:07:18] Spirit,
[1:07:20] what moved the
[1:07:23] uh holy men of God, what moved them to
[1:07:26] speak and caused them to bring forth
[1:07:30] uh in John John 12 and verse 24.
[1:07:35] This will just put a little different
[1:07:37] slant on it here for the moment. Verily,
[1:07:41] verily, verily, I say unto you, except a
[1:07:43] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[1:07:45] die, it abideth alone. But if it die, it
[1:07:49] bringeth forth fruit. That is the same
[1:07:52] word as it moved. What moved the
[1:07:56] prophets? Now Jesus is saying he's using
[1:08:00] exactly the same word that if a corn and
[1:08:03] wheat fall in the ground and it abideth
[1:08:06] alone but if it die it bringeth forth it
[1:08:09] bringeth forth fruit. In John 15 and2,
[1:08:13] every branch in me that beareth not
[1:08:15] fruit, he taketh away, and every branch
[1:08:18] that beareth fruit, this is bearing,
[1:08:22] the same as carrying the word, it bears
[1:08:25] the fruit, he purgeth it that it may
[1:08:27] bring forth more fruit. Let me just stop
[1:08:30] here for a moment before we go on to the
[1:08:31] other scriptures and say this that
[1:08:34] I it is if you will just relax
[1:08:39] and just trust what God
[1:08:42] has done in a person's life in your own
[1:08:46] individual life.
[1:08:48] The branch does not wrestle and struggle
[1:08:52] to bear the fruit. It will bear the
[1:08:55] fruit. Amen.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; The life is is like an involuntary
[1:09:00] power that's in it. But for a believer,
[1:09:04] there's one thing that we need do need
[1:09:05] to do. Brother Lance ministered on it on
[1:09:08] Sunday. And that is one thing you can
[1:09:11] do. And that is where your choice comes
[1:09:14] in. You can yield
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; or you can resist it.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; See, and that is where we need to yield
[1:09:23] to the Holy Spirit. then the Holy Spirit
[1:09:26] will do the work. You just need to yield
[1:09:28] to it. And that yielding is a is a
[1:09:31] continual thing. All right. In in John
[1:09:33] 15:4, also abide in me and I in you. As
[1:09:37] the branch cannot bear, it's moved by
[1:09:40] the Holy Ghost cannot bear fruit of
[1:09:42] itself except it abide in the vine. No
[1:09:45] more can ye except you abide in me.
[1:09:48] John 15 and5 we find it again. I'm the
[1:09:52] vine, you are the branches. He that
[1:09:53] abideth in me, and I in him, the same
[1:09:56] bring bringeth which is being moved
[1:09:59] bringeth forth much fruit, for without
[1:10:02] me you can do nothing. And then in Acts
[1:10:04] 2 and two, this is interesting.
[1:10:12] And suddenly there came a sound from
[1:10:14] heaven as of a rushing. And the word
[1:10:18] rushing is the same word as beareth
[1:10:22] fruit to bear fruit or
[1:10:26] holy men of God where moved same word
[1:10:31] rushing wind coming on the what happened
[1:10:35] then those people they begin to act
[1:10:38] different than when they'd walked in the
[1:10:40] doors
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; they began to do different things and
[1:10:43] the Holy Ghost came upon them they spake
[1:10:45] in other languages.
[1:10:48] and they walked out
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; absolutely
[1:10:52] uh possessed
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost. They were possessed
[1:10:56] of another spirit but as a spirit of
[1:10:59] life
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; and they walked out into the world,
[1:11:03] different people.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Peter a coward before and now he stands
[1:11:07] up and says hear me.
[1:11:10] He denied it before, but now he's
[1:11:12] saying, "Hear me." by the Holy Ghost,
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; the power of life, and it moved through
[1:11:18] him. Whether whether they were in
[1:11:20] prison, whether they were threatened, it
[1:11:22] always was the same. Or they might be
[1:11:24] for uh 3,000 coming on the day of
[1:11:27] Pentecost and being converted. How
[1:11:30] glorious. But it wasn't that way always.
[1:11:33] But the spirit that was in them was
[1:11:36] always always the same.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; The spirit that was motivating them
[1:11:44] wasn't up today, down tomorrow, 100°
[1:11:47] now, now zero, below zero. No, no, no.
[1:11:50] It's the same all the time. And it's
[1:11:53] moving through you. Whether you see it
[1:11:55] or you don't see it, it's moving through
[1:11:57] you. You have to believe that.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:12:02] Hallelujah.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; A rushing mighty wind and to fill all
[1:12:09] the house where they were sitting. Now
[1:12:12] in trying to do a service without his
[1:12:15] will, brother Brandham refers to the
[1:12:18] burden of the word of the Lord.
[1:12:21] And he says, "Brethren, don't miss
[1:12:22] this." Now, if you know, trying to do a
[1:12:25] service, I want to just give the setting
[1:12:27] perhaps for the young people. Brother
[1:12:29] Brandham was speaking to the Christian
[1:12:30] businessmen. The Christian businessmen
[1:12:32] were under the impression the preachers
[1:12:34] have failed.
[1:12:36] Preachers have failed. Churches have
[1:12:38] failed. They're all split up. And now
[1:12:41] we've come together. And the one reason
[1:12:44] brother Brandham came and actually
[1:12:45] opened up many chapters for them was
[1:12:48] because he did agree with them on this
[1:12:51] one major point. And that is that they
[1:12:53] were they were disregarding all the
[1:12:55] denominational barriers. I'm a Catholic.
[1:12:58] I'm a Presbyterian. I'm a Methodist. I'm
[1:12:59] a Pentecostal. And for that one thing,
[1:13:01] Brother Brandham opened up chapters for
[1:13:03] them because he supported them. But they
[1:13:06] also had other things. They believed
[1:13:08] that prosperity was spirituality.
[1:13:11] But if they prospered, they were really
[1:13:13] spiritual. And he chopped that down. And
[1:13:16] they also believed that churches have
[1:13:18] failed, ministers have failed, and we're
[1:13:21] the ones God has prospered us. We're
[1:13:23] blessed. We're going to take the gospel
[1:13:25] to the world. And so he he he told him
[1:13:28] here and trying to do trying to do God a
[1:13:30] service without his will, he went back
[1:13:32] to the scripture and he said David had a
[1:13:34] better idea of how to get the word to
[1:13:37] the people said the ark is away. We need
[1:13:40] to bring the ark back. The ark was
[1:13:42] supposed to be on the shoulders of the
[1:13:43] Levites but others said we're and
[1:13:46] brother Brandham says they got anointed.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; In other words, they were motivated
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; by the anointing.
[1:13:54] Amen.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; So a person could get anointed and oh
[1:13:59] really enthused. He also used the word
[1:14:01] enthused. And because they were
[1:14:04] enthused, they were motivated. But the
[1:14:06] cart was wrong.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; They put it on a cart. And the word has
[1:14:11] to be moved. And it's the same today.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not here by my choice. Amen.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Any man of God that takes the word of
[1:14:18] God, the word of God moves to the people
[1:14:22] on the shoulders of the Levites, and
[1:14:24] it'll never be any other way.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Others may do it,
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; but God will not support it.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; And it be a it'll be a nice card. It
[1:14:34] might be a better card. It might be
[1:14:36] fancier. It might have more money behind
[1:14:38] it, but God won't be behind it. And so
[1:14:41] God and so, Brother Brandham is saying,
[1:14:44] don't miss this. And my sisters, you who
[1:14:47] want to be woman preachers and so forth,
[1:14:50] don't you miss this. No matter how much
[1:14:53] your anointing is, you've got to get in
[1:14:56] God's provided position. And he said,
[1:15:00] David's anointing was all right.
[1:15:04] He was dancing.
[1:15:06] He was having a time. Don't tell me he
[1:15:08] wasn't happy. And and we could say, "Was
[1:15:11] it God's will to bring that word back?"
[1:15:14] Of course it is.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. You'd think that would be
[1:15:19] more important than how it came back.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; If we were back there at that time, and
[1:15:24] I can almost hear myself saying it in my
[1:15:27] ignorance. I don't care how it gets back
[1:15:29] as long as it gets back.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; But not with God's program.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; The program that he set up is the
[1:15:36] program that he was going to bless. And
[1:15:38] it's the only program he was going to
[1:15:40] bless.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; And so they were anointed. He says, "And
[1:15:45] David's anointing was all right, but in
[1:15:47] doing it, he got enthused."
[1:15:50] He got enthused
[1:15:53] and stepped over the boundary line. Oh
[1:15:56] my, I I've just seen so much of it. They
[1:16:00] people get enthused and then they cross
[1:16:02] the border boundary line of how God has
[1:16:06] ordained a thing to be done. So we need
[1:16:08] to stay in that program.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; He said it was on the shoulders of his
[1:16:14] ministers. His ministers was the
[1:16:17] Levites. Put it over their left shoulder
[1:16:20] and pack the ark like this because it
[1:16:22] was up over their heart and they had the
[1:16:25] burden of the word of the Lord.
[1:16:29] See, the word of the Lord is not, you
[1:16:32] know, as a minister, I can tell you we
[1:16:34] we don't sit in a room and and try and
[1:16:36] get a message
[1:16:38] or just read some interesting material
[1:16:40] and try to get a message. That's not it.
[1:16:42] The burden of the word may be a burden
[1:16:44] that you'll have for a very very long
[1:16:46] time and then it'll just evolve and
[1:16:49] it'll just move and finally the time
[1:16:52] will come and God will show it in the
[1:16:54] scripture and say, "Here it is." You
[1:16:56] know, speak it to the people. And then
[1:16:58] someone comes after it and says, "Oh,
[1:17:00] just right now I needed that just at
[1:17:02] this minute."
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; That's really wonderful.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; In the message, the greatest battle.
[1:17:09] Now, these are just some of the quotes
[1:17:11] I'm giving you.
[1:17:15] Do you realize some of the things which
[1:17:18] I just said inspirationally? Now, I want
[1:17:19] to give you the quote. Do you realize
[1:17:21] that there's really only two powers in
[1:17:23] the universe?
[1:17:25] of all of our differences between
[1:17:27] nations and differences between each
[1:17:30] other and everything. It all amounts up
[1:17:33] to two powers. There's only two powers
[1:17:36] and there's only two kingdoms. Two
[1:17:38] powers and two kingdoms. All the rest of
[1:17:41] the little minor things are connected
[1:17:44] with either one of those two powers. All
[1:17:46] the rest are just little minor things
[1:17:47] are connected with one of these two
[1:17:49] powers.
[1:17:51] And those powers is God's power and
[1:17:54] Satan's power.
[1:17:57] That's what every war, every disorder,
[1:18:00] everything that comes along, it's either
[1:18:03] controlled by God's power or Satan's
[1:18:06] power. And that is the power of life and
[1:18:10] the power of death. And so, just to kind
[1:18:13] of set your minds and perhaps the Lord
[1:18:15] willing, I'd like to be able to come on
[1:18:18] to this on Sunday.
[1:18:21] If we took different people through the
[1:18:24] scriptures that we could relate to,
[1:18:27] we'll find times in their life where
[1:18:29] there was no mistake whatsoever
[1:18:32] that it was God.
[1:18:35] They say, "I know that that's God. An
[1:18:37] angel of the Lord came or whatever
[1:18:39] more."
[1:18:41] And Lord willing, I may come to this. I
[1:18:44] just I was going to hold it back, but I
[1:18:45] just mentioned Samuel as a as a boy, 12
[1:18:49] years old. Now, most of you fellas here
[1:18:51] are beyond that.
[1:18:53] He's just 12 years old, they say.
[1:18:57] And now
[1:19:00] he hears a voice, calls his name,
[1:19:04] he goes to Eli cuz he thinks Eli's
[1:19:06] calling him. And that happens about
[1:19:08] three times. And Eli tells him, "Go and
[1:19:11] lay down again." And if he calls you,
[1:19:14] say, "Here am I." Your servant hears.
[1:19:18] And he goes and and he hears a call
[1:19:21] again.
[1:19:22] Now listen closely.
[1:19:25] That voice
[1:19:27] that was calling him was going to be the
[1:19:31] motivating force in his life from that
[1:19:34] day on.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; But he didn't know it.
[1:19:39] Even to the time he was being rejected
[1:19:42] years and years later, he's now being
[1:19:45] rejected by the very nation he was a
[1:19:47] prophet to and are rejecting him and
[1:19:50] saying, "Samuel, give us a prophet." And
[1:19:54] they had a reason for it because his
[1:19:56] sons had gone had gone and done evil and
[1:20:00] he got old and they said, "Give us give
[1:20:03] us a pro give us a king." And he told
[1:20:06] him what the king would do. But he was
[1:20:08] being rejected. And even in that
[1:20:10] rejection, even when he's being
[1:20:12] rejected, and we can all relate to that,
[1:20:14] we've been turned aside by somebody.
[1:20:16] We've lost some friends.
[1:20:19] And even in rejection, that same voice
[1:20:22] he heard because that was life.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; That was life back then.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; And it was still life. It was life when
[1:20:33] he was in the midst of his, shall we
[1:20:35] say, glory days. It was life and it was
[1:20:39] life. And some of you maybe this evening
[1:20:42] you're everything's just going right on
[1:20:45] top and say it's just great. And maybe
[1:20:48] to someone else, you might be saying
[1:20:50] this is the hardest time of my life
[1:20:52] right now. I've never gone through a
[1:20:54] harder time. But I will say this, the
[1:20:57] voice that you once heard and you didn't
[1:20:59] even know who it was that was calling
[1:21:01] you, that's the same voice that's
[1:21:04] motivating you and pushing you on. Amen.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; And he'll push you on
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; and he'll just drive you on it. You You
[1:21:12] don't feel some great enthusiasm, but
[1:21:13] he's there. He's pushing you forward.
[1:21:15] He's moving you forward. And my brothers
[1:21:18] and sisters, tonight, I want to say to
[1:21:20] you, if it was life back then,
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; a year ago or 30 years ago or more, if
[1:21:26] it was life then, it's life tonight.
[1:21:28] Amen.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; And if I took it the other way, and I
[1:21:33] don't want to get on to it, but uh save
[1:21:35] it for Sunday, but there's people that
[1:21:39] have taken a turn or gone a certain
[1:21:41] direction, and they thought, "Oh, this
[1:21:42] is great." You know, I got a better
[1:21:44] opportunity. Things are things are going
[1:21:46] to go better for me. And, you know, I
[1:21:48] let go of my my my message beliefs. And,
[1:21:51] you know, it's a lot easier now and I
[1:21:53] can do this and I can do the other thing
[1:21:55] and so on so forth. that I don't go to
[1:21:56] church and maybe cut my hair or do
[1:21:59] whatever more.
[1:22:01] They don't realize that the thing that's
[1:22:03] motivating them now, his name is death.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; And he was death in the beginning
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; and he's still death
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; and it'll be death. It's only life or
[1:22:16] death. It's only Satan or God.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:24] Now, I guess I'm I'm I'm just going to
[1:22:26] be short tonight,
[1:22:28] but I I will uh touch on this.
[1:22:34] Uh
[1:22:41] the scripture says, "While we look not,"
[1:22:45] and you know the scripture well, "while
[1:22:47] we look not at the things which are
[1:22:49] seen, but at the things which are not
[1:22:52] seen, for the things which are seen are
[1:22:56] temporal, but the things which are not
[1:22:58] seen are eternal."
[1:23:01] And I want you to think about this and
[1:23:03] then be thinking about this until Sunday
[1:23:04] as well.
[1:23:06] The world that you and I look at the
[1:23:10] seen things what we see.
[1:23:15] I'm I think I consider myself a very
[1:23:17] positive person.
[1:23:19] I really do. And I consider you a
[1:23:21] positive people. But the things that are
[1:23:24] around us and the and the world that you
[1:23:27] rub shoulders with
[1:23:29] is a very negative place.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you say so? Amen.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; And when you walk down the street or you
[1:23:41] go to your place of work
[1:23:44] and when you see what you see and you
[1:23:47] hear what you hear,
[1:23:51] you see how people conduct themselves.
[1:23:54] You see how the world dresses.
[1:23:57] You see and hear the language that they
[1:23:59] use.
[1:24:01] You go to a shopping mall. You go to the
[1:24:04] service station, you go to pay your
[1:24:07] bill, there's all those magazines right
[1:24:09] in front of the cash desk.
[1:24:11] They put the worst of them right there.
[1:24:14] And then you
[1:24:17] you may be with your friends and you
[1:24:20] hear this and you hear that and you hear
[1:24:22] cursing and you hear crude language
[1:24:26] and you hear of this fight
[1:24:29] and you hear what this family's doing
[1:24:32] and you hear of this marriage breakup.
[1:24:36] You hear about these children. You hear
[1:24:37] about then you hear the news and you
[1:24:40] hear there's been this kind of disaster
[1:24:42] and this plane that crashed just this
[1:24:45] morning and 113 people are gone and
[1:24:49] they're all and not far from where Tony
[1:24:51] and Rebecca are right now. It's Armenian
[1:24:53] airplane. You just hear it every day.
[1:24:55] Every few minutes you just hear it. It
[1:24:58] just leaves you heavy.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Leaves you heavy. It's a very very
[1:25:03] negative world.
[1:25:06] And the scripture says, "While we
[1:25:10] look not at the things which are seen,
[1:25:14] but at the things which are not seen."
[1:25:17] Because if we look at the things that
[1:25:19] are seen, our lives are going to be
[1:25:21] motivated in the wrong direction.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; I want to leave you with that thought.
[1:25:30] We'll be motivated very much in the
[1:25:32] wrong direction.
[1:25:35] and and uh brother Brandham said this.
[1:25:40] Do you know that the devil has a
[1:25:42] language?
[1:25:46] Did you know brother Brandham talked
[1:25:47] about the devil's language?
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; I said the devil has a language.
[1:25:58] Oh, you're quiet.
[1:26:04] He said,
[1:26:08] now he said, "Now Paul here,
[1:26:11] uh, here of the valley or the shadow
[1:26:13] rather, the law, he's talking about the
[1:26:16] the law of the Old Testament being a
[1:26:19] shadow of good things to come. He could
[1:26:21] it could never make the worshipper
[1:26:23] perfect." Then he goes on to show what
[1:26:26] perfection is. Now it's a strange thing
[1:26:30] that this is so much thought of uh so
[1:26:33] much thought of people they say
[1:26:37] okay you listening people say
[1:26:43] and no doubt
[1:26:45] we have said it at some time or another
[1:26:49] but that is speaking in tongues that God
[1:26:51] doesn't want you to speak in
[1:26:55] and that is he said people say, "Well,
[1:27:00] I'm weak.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; My faith is not very much.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not a very good Christian."
[1:27:10] He said, "That's just what the devil
[1:27:13] wants you to say,
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; and you're just talking his language
[1:27:17] right now."
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "You mustn't never say
[1:27:25] that. Don't never let your testimony be
[1:27:28] negative. Let it be positive.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Never permit a negative thought to come
[1:27:32] in your mind if you can help it. And
[1:27:35] when it starts, don't entertain it.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; If it does start, don't entertain a
[1:27:40] negative thought. Why? Because those
[1:27:43] negative thoughts will eventually
[1:27:46] motivate you in a negative direction.
[1:27:50] And you'll find yourself doing negative
[1:27:53] things and speaking negative things. And
[1:27:55] this just isn't positive thinking. This
[1:27:58] is God's word. God word God's word wants
[1:28:01] you to confess the truth.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And negative never come from God.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says that is his
[1:28:11] language right there.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not very good. I'm not a very good
[1:28:16] Christian. I'm weak. my faith is weak.
[1:28:21] And he said, you'll never live above
[1:28:23] your confession in works. Uh I do bear
[1:28:27] witness that message. He said this. He
[1:28:31] said, if that he said, now healing is
[1:28:34] not something that you just say, well,
[1:28:36] yeah, I believe it. I believe it. It's
[1:28:38] not that. Healing is not and whether
[1:28:41] it's healing, whether it's healing or or
[1:28:43] whatever it is, it doesn't make any
[1:28:45] difference. But he said it's not just
[1:28:47] saying, "Yeah, I believe it. Yeah, I
[1:28:48] believe it." It's more than that. Listen
[1:28:51] closely, friends. We're not We're not
[1:28:53] talking. This isn't kindergarten stuff.
[1:28:56] This is this is things that you can live
[1:28:58] by.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; You can put this into practice right
[1:29:01] now.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "And well, yeah, I believe it.
[1:29:05] I believe it." He said, "Now, that's all
[1:29:07] right." If you say, "Yeah, I believe it.
[1:29:08] I believe it." He said that's all right
[1:29:11] if that's the best you can do
[1:29:14] just mentally or just say yes I see it I
[1:29:18] believe that I accept it then if you
[1:29:21] accept it on those basis
[1:29:24] keep saying it
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; over and over
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; he said it out loud
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; don't don't don't don't don't whisper it
[1:29:34] don't think it in your mind say it over
[1:29:37] and over I believe it. I believe it. Do
[1:29:40] you believe it? I accept it.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe it. Say it out
[1:29:45] loud. I believe it. And you keep saying
[1:29:47] it over and over until it becomes a
[1:29:50] reality to you.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; And that's how you defeat these negative
[1:29:55] things.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Say it out loud. Say it
[1:29:58] over and over. Just keep saying it. I'm
[1:30:00] healed. I'm healed." Say it until
[1:30:03] actually you believe it. And when you
[1:30:04] believe it, then it's going to take
[1:30:07] place.
[1:30:08] Hallelujah.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Let's say praise the Lord.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's say I believe it.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; And soon as you give that testimony, the
[1:30:19] high priest comes moving on the scene.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Glory. Praise his name. How we thank
[1:30:25] you, Lord Jesus. Amen. I believe it. I
[1:30:28] believe it.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; And if it's the very best you can do,
[1:30:32] just keep doing the best you can do.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't he wonderful?
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Well, that's just the beginning. Being
[1:30:42] moved
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; by the power
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; of life.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; And being moved.
[1:30:49] I I I've just to close now. I'm just
[1:30:52] going to close. I've seen people and
[1:30:54] they get all enthused about something.
[1:30:56] And actually, they're not only enthused,
[1:30:59] they're confused
[1:31:02] because they're enthused about
[1:31:04] something. And I know in my heart, and I
[1:31:07] think deep down in their heart of
[1:31:08] hearts, they know it's wrong, too.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; They got enthused about it and actually
[1:31:13] feel anointed about it, but they know
[1:31:15] they're headed in the wrong direction.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:22] And I know
[1:31:24] that it's death at work.
[1:31:26] And from there, it'll just deteriorate
[1:31:31] and it'll be worse.
[1:31:33] and a few months down the road there's
[1:31:36] some other catastrophe and on and on and
[1:31:38] on it goes. But oh, I tell you what,
[1:31:41] friends, if you start moving in the
[1:31:43] right direction, I just love it. I love
[1:31:46] I think a quote, I think brother Tom
[1:31:48] made it last Sunday morning that when
[1:31:51] you speak and you confess it, you're
[1:31:53] moving a mountain, a grain of sand at a
[1:31:56] time.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; That's the same thing. Brother Brandham
[1:31:59] saying the same thing. Say it.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Say it again. Say it out loud. Say it
[1:32:03] over and over. Say it until you believe
[1:32:05] it.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And when you really
[1:32:08] believe it, it's going to happen."
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Isn't that simple?
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Do you know what? Don't stumble over the
[1:32:15] simplicity, friends.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandon wasn't
[1:32:18] teaching a kindergarten class. He was
[1:32:21] teaching people how to have victory.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; He was teaching people how to crush
[1:32:25] Satan in their life. He was teaching how
[1:32:28] to have victory. Amen.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; And if it'll work today,
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; did it ever work in your life?
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Did it ever work in your life?
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; It'll work tonight the same way.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; And back then you believed it. You
[1:32:41] believe it again right now.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it'll work.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; It'll absolutely work.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; And God's no respector person. Don't
[1:32:52] say, "Well, you know, I'm not, you know,
[1:32:54] brother Ed or some brother this brother
[1:32:56] that sister, they're real strong." Don't
[1:32:58] think that you're in the wrong
[1:33:00] direction. You're heading for a negative
[1:33:03] a heading downfall. But let the let the
[1:33:06] power of life motivate you.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; You know what that power of life wants
[1:33:09] you to do today, this evening, he wants
[1:33:12] you to keep saying it.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; He wants you to say it tomorrow morning.
[1:33:16] You wake up tomorrow morning and maybe
[1:33:18] before your feet hit the floor, say, "I
[1:33:20] believe it.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; I believe this word. I believe this
[1:33:23] message has been sent to me. I believe
[1:33:25] everything has been made real to me. And
[1:33:27] I believe some things I don't
[1:33:29] understand.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; I believe things he hasn't revealed to
[1:33:35] me yet.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Cuz I know what he reveals to me will be
[1:33:38] truth
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; and truth will be life,
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; eternal life.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I've been singing a song
[1:33:48] and I want to sing it.
[1:33:51] You help me find it. What was it,
[1:33:52] Brother John? Now I can forget, but you
[1:33:55] can't.
[1:33:59] 2547.
[1:34:02] I wrote it down. 2547.
[1:34:05] It's a
[1:34:07] a song I sang
[1:34:10] when I didn't understand it fully.
[1:34:14] My father would, you know, get us get up
[1:34:16] there and mother played a little pump
[1:34:19] organ. It was in a construction camp.
[1:34:22] And I remember them singing this song. I
[1:34:24] think they sang it almost every Sunday.
[1:34:26] Savior like a shepherd lead me. But oh,
[1:34:29] how we need him to lead us. And a
[1:34:31] blessed blessed words to this hymn.
[1:34:34] Amen. Let's let's stand as we sing it.
[1:34:36] And I I hope it'll be a real blessing to
[1:34:38] you.
[1:34:42] Savior,
[1:34:44] like a shepherd, lead
[1:34:47] us much we need thy tender care. Earth
[1:34:54] and thy pleasant pastures feed us.
[1:35:05] Blessed Jesus,
[1:35:08] blessed Jesus,
[1:35:11] thou has
[1:35:13] thy
[1:35:17] blessed Jesus.
[1:35:20] Blessed Jesus
[1:35:23] thy
[1:35:26] we are.
[1:35:30] We are thy who thou be friend
[1:35:34] us
[1:35:38] in our way.
[1:35:42] Keep th from sin. Defend
[1:35:46] us. Jesus
[1:35:49] when we go astray.
[1:35:52] Blessed Jesus.
[1:35:55] Blessed Jesus.
[1:35:59] My children
[1:36:02] pray.
[1:36:04] Blessed Jesus.
[1:36:07] Blessed Jesus.
[1:36:10] Hear my children.
[1:36:14] And we'll sing the last verse.
[1:36:18] Let us seek thy favor.
[1:36:23] Early
[1:36:25] to thy will.
[1:36:39] Blessed Jesus.
[1:36:42] Blessed Jesus
[1:36:45] Christ.
[1:36:51] Blessed Jesus.
[1:36:54] Blessed Jesus.
[1:36:57] Thou has loved us.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Savior,
[1:37:06] like a shepherd, lead
[1:37:09] us
[1:37:11] much. We need thy tender care. Before we
[1:37:16] do
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; sweetly now, blessed Jesus,
[1:37:33] blessed Jesus,
[1:37:37] thouast
[1:37:40] we are.
[1:37:43] Oh blessed Jesus,
[1:37:46] blessed Jesus.
[1:37:50] Thou has
[1:37:56] God bless you, sheep of his fold.
[1:38:01] Flock of God, the Bible calls you.
[1:38:05] The elect lady, Peter calls you.
[1:38:09] How blessed we are
[1:38:12] to feed in his flock, to feed in his
[1:38:14] pastures.
[1:38:16] And that last verse where we sang early
[1:38:18] let me I thought of you young people
[1:38:21] that are here tonight
[1:38:23] and you don't know how I respect you
[1:38:26] because there's multitudes very very few
[1:38:30] very few churches even within the
[1:38:33] message that has young people sitting
[1:38:37] across on the front seat filling all
[1:38:39] these seats. But I will tell you and
[1:38:42] remember maybe one day brother Ed is not
[1:38:45] here. Remember, remember what I'm saying
[1:38:48] to you. You will never regret these days
[1:38:53] when early you sought him.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; I'm a long ways down the road, but I
[1:38:58] sought him early in my life. In my early
[1:39:01] teens, in my later teens, it was all
[1:39:04] over then.
[1:39:07] Early will I seek him. You will never
[1:39:10] regret it. And God is preserving you
[1:39:13] many, many scars that others have had to
[1:39:16] bear because they didn't hear it and
[1:39:18] they didn't know it, but you do. God
[1:39:22] bless you, David. I'm going to ask you
[1:39:24] to come and dismiss us in prayer if you
[1:39:26] would please. God bless you and be
[1:39:28] praying for us for Sunday, will you? God
[1:39:30] bless you, brother David. Amen.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, Lord God, once
[1:39:37] again, we've come to thy house of
[1:39:39] worship, Lord God. thy house of praise,
[1:39:41] Lord Jesus. Father, Lord God, we've come
[1:39:44] with with open hearts, Lord Jesus. And
[1:39:46] Father, we've received thy word, Lord
[1:39:47] God, with gentleness, Lord God, and
[1:39:49] meekness, Lord, Father. Once again,
[1:39:51] Lord, Father, you fed your sheep, Lord
[1:39:52] God. You've taken the man out of the
[1:39:54] way, Father. You've spoken through these
[1:39:56] mortal lips, Lord Jesus. Father, we heed
[1:39:59] thy word, Lord. And truly, we can say
[1:40:00] that we believe it, Lord Jesus. We keep
[1:40:03] confessing it, Lord God. Even though we
[1:40:04] don't believe it now, Father, we know,
[1:40:06] Father, according to thy word, Jesus,
[1:40:08] that we will believe it, Lord. For it's
[1:40:10] been prophesied about us, Lord God, in
[1:40:11] the days of old Lord, that there will
[1:40:13] be, Lord God, a bride without spot or
[1:40:15] wrinkle, Father. Here we stand, Lord
[1:40:17] Jesus, before thee, Lord God. We're
[1:40:19] testifying of it, Lord God. Father,
[1:40:21] we're pressing on, Lord. We're not
[1:40:22] looking at the world outside, Lord, but
[1:40:24] we're looking to you, Lord God, the hope
[1:40:25] of glory.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Father, even now, Lord Jesus, as we just
[1:40:29] dismiss, Father, we pray that we do not
[1:40:31] dismiss from thy presence, Lord Jesus.
[1:40:33] That Father, you just confirm these
[1:40:34] words that you have spoken deep within
[1:40:36] our hearts, Lord. Father, that as we
[1:40:38] continue, Father, during the week, Lord
[1:40:40] Jesus, we continue to meditate upon
[1:40:42] these words, Father, that we come to
[1:40:43] that house once again on Sunday, the
[1:40:45] Lord will and Father, stronger, Lord
[1:40:47] Jesus, fortified with thy word, Lord
[1:40:49] God, and filled with your spirit, Lord.
[1:40:51] Father, looking forward to that day when
[1:40:53] you come and receive us once again.
[1:40:54] Bless thy people now, Lord, keep us safe
[1:40:57] in the way, Lord Jesus. Bless the
[1:40:59] pastor, Lord, Father, bless your
[1:41:00] ministers, Father, that take the burden
[1:41:01] of the word, Lord. Father, may we
[1:41:04] continue, Lord Jesus, just to bask in
[1:41:05] thy presence, Father, in Jesus Christ's
[1:41:07] name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you,
[1:41:11] brother David. God bless you. Amen. God
[1:41:13] bless you. God bless you all.
[1:41:18] How many heard of the earthquake in down
[1:41:20] in Tonga this morning? Very few. 8 point
[1:41:26] 8 point earthquake. Very very large
[1:41:28] earthquake. They said that there was a
[1:41:30] tsunami, a wave that was going to strike
[1:41:33] New Zealand and also Fiji. And Tom and
[1:41:37] Joanne had just gone to Fiji. And uh so
[1:41:42] we finally got a hold of them about
[1:41:44] between 4 and 5 this morning. And there
[1:41:47] was nobody in even in the lobby of the
[1:41:50] place where they are, the hotel or motel
[1:41:53] where it is. And uh so finally when
[1:41:55] people arrived there, I mean the staff
[1:41:58] arrived, he was actually instructing
[1:42:00] them and he said he said it was just
[1:42:03] amazing. He said he was reminded of when
[1:42:04] we were in China because he said it was
[1:42:06] like the message network that was
[1:42:09] working and and he was getting more
[1:42:12] information than anyone else down there.
[1:42:15] And then and the people were praying and
[1:42:17] concerned and and the management says,
[1:42:19] "Well, we'll move you to higher floors
[1:42:21] or we'll get you." And I just text them.
[1:42:23] And I says, you know, don't believe
[1:42:24] anybody. Just get to higher ground, you
[1:42:26] know, if that is the case. And uh here,
[1:42:29] you know, uh sister
[1:42:31] uh Sister Anne Zeller's mother's here,
[1:42:34] Sister Donaldson from New Zealand. And
[1:42:38] um you know, I know that they were in
[1:42:39] contact with uh uh saints back there.
[1:42:42] And there's a lot of saints in a lot of
[1:42:44] saints in Fiji, a lot of saints in the
[1:42:46] islands, a lot of saints in New Zealand.
[1:42:49] And here they said it would have hit New
[1:42:51] Zealand in 40 minutes. And turned out
[1:42:55] they said, you know, there was no
[1:42:57] tsunami
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; from an 8-point earthquake. There was
[1:43:00] none. So we thank God for it.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Dismissed in the name of Jesus
[1:43:06] Christ. Greet one another and be happy
[1:43:08] in Christ. And and remember to say it
[1:43:10] out loud. You're dismissed. God bless
[1:43:13] you.
[1:43:15] God bless you, brother. Love you back.
[1:43:42] Heat. Heat.
