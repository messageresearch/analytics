[11:23] and we've heard his word. We know what
[11:25] that word says.

[11:30] prayer.
[11:31] I want to go to prayer tonight. Brother
[11:34] Dier, if you'd come and just open the
[11:35] service in a word of prayer. We have
[11:38] a request for a brother from Ohio. He
[11:41] has serious complications due to
[11:43] diabetes as well as a heart condition.
[11:45] Please pray for both spiritual and
[11:47] physical healing. As well, brother Cucon
[11:50] phone and ask for prayer. So, we just
[11:51] want to remember these. Amen. Whatever
[11:53] need that you have, the Lord knows our
[11:56] needs. Amen.
[11:58] Let's just sing it one more time.
[12:00] [Music]
[12:04] Be it unto me
[12:09] according to your word
[12:14] according to your promises.
[12:20] I can stand
[12:25] Lord carve upon my heart
[12:30] the truth that sets me free
[12:36] according to your word
[12:40] [Music]
[12:43] to me.
[12:52] Let's pray together.
[12:57] Our most gracious heavenly father,
[13:02] it's a grand privilege for us tonight to
[13:04] stand before you again, Lord,
[13:07] knowing that you're the one who have
[13:09] ordained this gathering from before the
[13:11] foundation of the world.
[13:14] Father, we are tonight in expectation of
[13:17] what you have in store for us, oh God,
[13:21] believing that it is your word that
[13:23] we're found in tonight. For you declare
[13:26] that forsake not the assembling of
[13:29] yourself much more as you see that day
[13:31] approaching.
[13:33] And tonight we have not forsaken the
[13:35] assembling of ourselves. We have come,
[13:37] oh God, so willingly and so desirous to
[13:40] have an encounter with the living God,
[13:43] knowing that man shall not live by bread
[13:45] alone, but by every word that proceed
[13:48] from the throne and the mouth of God. So
[13:51] tonight our eyes are fixed upon you,
[13:53] great one, knowing that you are
[13:56] sufficiency and are all in all, knowing
[13:58] that you never failed us yet, oh God,
[14:00] and you'll not be guilty tonight of a
[14:02] breach of promise. our God will keep his
[14:05] word toward those that expect him to do
[14:08] so, Father. So, we come asking that
[14:11] you'll move among us once again. That
[14:13] you'll renew our spiritual energy
[14:15] tonight. That you'll visit us, oh God,
[14:18] each one in our place of duty tonight,
[14:20] coming to pull upon the word. coming in
[14:23] faith and expecting to receive from you,
[14:25] Lord, knowing that we'll not go out
[14:27] empty, Father, but we'll go rejoicing
[14:30] with a testimony that our hearts did
[14:32] burn within us. Oh God, as you spoke to
[14:35] us along the way, anoint your servant
[14:37] tonight, Father, knowing that it's not
[14:39] by might nor by power. It is by your
[14:42] spirit alone. So take the man's servant
[14:45] and remove the human element, Lord, and
[14:47] let the divine portion drop down from
[14:49] heaven that he'll be nothing but a
[14:51] reflector of the light that come from
[14:53] your throne and that he may shine down
[14:56] upon our hearts, oh God, and bring the
[14:58] change that we're looking for. But we
[15:00] want to go from glory unto glory until
[15:03] we stand, Father, in that new body that
[15:06] you promised to us, Lord. That's the
[15:08] reason of our gathering tonight. So we
[15:10] want you to have your preeminence today.
[15:13] Just move among us in an unusual manner.
[15:16] Touch every heart, Father, and bring
[15:18] comfort to the discouraged and healing
[15:20] to those that are sick. Father, even the
[15:22] prayer requests that were read tonight,
[15:24] we lay our hands upon them. Father, this
[15:27] brother with diabetes complication, we
[15:30] know that you're the great physician,
[15:32] the sympathizing Jesus. We invite you on
[15:34] the sin. Father, let your healing virtue
[15:37] go and visit him at his place, oh God,
[15:40] that he may receive a healing touch from
[15:42] you and our brother Mike Cooken tonight.
[15:45] We ask that you'll remember him also,
[15:47] Lord. And each one of us here tonight,
[15:49] Lord, where various need, but you're
[15:51] mindful of them, Father. So, we just ask
[15:54] that you'll have your way among us, that
[15:56] your great name once again will be
[15:58] admired among the congregation, Lord.
[16:00] That you just have an unusual way to
[16:03] move, Lord. Father for you move in
[16:05] mysterious way your wonders to perform.
[16:08] This meeting is dying. We simply commit
[16:11] it to you father asking that you'll have
[16:13] the preeminence that you lead and guide
[16:16] in all things. Bless each son and
[16:18] daughter tonight. Even the stranger and
[16:20] the visitors among us. Remember them
[16:22] all. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[16:29] [Music]
[16:31] &gt;&gt; Have your seats.
[16:39] Amen. We want to welcome brother Greg
[16:42] and sister Beatus are visiting from
[16:44] Denver, Colorado. Glad to have you. And
[16:46] I see the
[16:49] uh see the wicks back there. So, it's
[16:50] good to have you as well and all that
[16:52] are visiting with us.
[16:55] Let's uh

[17:04] Sounds like home to me. Amen.
[17:15] That sounds like home to me.
[17:20] Like where I want to be.

[17:29] to dim our eyes again.

[17:40] as we sing of his praise and glory
[17:45] where the saints of God will be.

[21:47] Amen.
[21:48] Hallelujah.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; More I surrender. I'm sure the more we
[21:54] can surrender tonight, the
[21:56] &gt;&gt; more we'll receive.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to be in the house of God.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; Good to be in expectation.
[22:05] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. I wonder we could maybe have
[22:09] you stand and I'd like to just sing we
[22:11] are standing on holy ground. Tom,
[22:15] [Music]
[22:20] I feel that
[22:22] whenever God's people get together, you
[22:25] know, they they have holy sites all over
[22:28] the world and different people have
[22:30] different places where they go and it's
[22:34] sacred or holy to them.
[22:36] There's been a lot of believers that
[22:38] have made their journey up to Sabina
[22:40] Canyon and different places and Sunset
[22:43] Mountain and whatever more. And they go
[22:45] to Israel. We go to Israel. We like to
[22:48] go to some special places. And I've been
[22:50] to the to the tomb and gone inside the
[22:53] tomb and was happy that it was empty.
[22:57] But the most sacred place is when a man
[22:59] or a woman or a young person meets God.
[23:05] I don't think I have no record in the
[23:08] scripture or any of the children of
[23:09] Israel ever went back to try to find the
[23:11] burning bush, but they had who had been
[23:14] in the burning bush with them.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; Friends, we got whoever was on Sunset
[23:19] Mountain. We got them right here.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got them right here.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Don't have to go any place.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; Find them tonight. Just talk to him
[23:29] tonight. Isn't that wonderful?
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:35] We are standing
[23:41] on
[23:43] [Applause]
[23:44] [Music]
[23:48] [Applause]
[23:52] our angels
[23:55] all around
[24:00] us.
[24:02] Let us praise him our Jesus.
[24:08] [Music]
[24:11] We are standing in his presence.
[24:18] [Music]
[24:21] &gt;&gt; Just in a moment of prayer before we
[24:23] turn to the word. Father, it's such a
[24:26] delightful time when your people come
[24:30] together. We can stand with your word,
[24:33] the holy scriptures open before us. And
[24:37] as your prophet has said, any
[24:40] individual, any man with strength can
[24:43] turn the pages. Lord, we would be
[24:46] completely incapable
[24:48] of determining what is written on those
[24:50] pages unless by the Holy Spirit you come
[24:54] with a divine light and a divine
[24:57] utterance and speak oh God the very
[25:00] thoughts of God. Pray that you will make
[25:02] known to us Lord your word and what we
[25:05] need for this time and for this season.
[25:09] Bless this congregation, Lord, and all
[25:12] of the invisible congregation wherever
[25:14] they might be throughout the world and
[25:16] streaming. I pray, Lord, that they will
[25:19] be able to say yay and amen to your word
[25:21] also. And that you will come into that
[25:24] very room or place where they are. And
[25:27] may it be a great blessing to all the
[25:29] body bride of Jesus Christ. For your
[25:32] glory, we ask it. And we submit
[25:34] ourselves giving ourselves wholly
[25:36] unreservedly to you.
[25:39] be with my lips, Lord, that I may utter
[25:42] and say just what you would have spoken,
[25:45] and may it fall into good ground,
[25:48] yielded heart, surrendered to you, Lord,
[25:51] in the name of Jesus Christ, our beloved
[25:54] Savior, Lord. Amen.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; I had a phone call today from brother
[26:05] Roy Shrewsbury.
[26:07] I don't know just how old our brother
[26:10] Shrewsbury is, but he's he's up ahead of
[26:12] me quite a few years. He said, "Well, I
[26:15] just preached three times, I think you
[26:17] said, on Sunday. They had a morning
[26:19] service and then went to prison to He
[26:21] goes to the prisons." He has a
[26:23] marvelous, the most wonderful open door
[26:25] of any man I know in the prisons. And
[26:30] they just kept filling up the chapel.
[26:32] And he preached, I think, three
[26:34] services.
[26:36] And he has such a heart for the men. The
[26:38] men know him. And on on occasions,
[26:42] uh, he's had the officers and the warden
[26:46] of the prison told him because he goes
[26:49] into places amongst men that were
[26:52] violent men, murderers, and so on. And
[26:55] they even told him if if they seize you,
[26:59] we cannot help you. we can't do anything
[27:03] if they take you hostage in that
[27:05] particular if you if you choose to go
[27:08] amongst these these individuals and he
[27:11] said that's fine because he said they
[27:14] know that I love them and he goes and
[27:16] mingles amongst them he told me just the
[27:19] other day when he was there day before
[27:21] yesterday I think it was he said that he
[27:24] one man came to him after the service
[27:27] and he said I'm here for life I won't
[27:31] ever get out of here. He asked him, "How
[27:34] many of you men have children?" He said,
[27:36] "Almost everyone raised their hand." And
[27:39] he had such a heart to think those men
[27:41] are incarcerated
[27:43] and uh won't see their children, can't
[27:45] be around them during this Christmas
[27:48] season or any other season, but
[27:50] especially at this time. And so, let's
[27:52] pray for brother Roy Shrewsbury. We
[27:55] can't get in there, but he does.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; And I think he deserves our prayers.
[28:00] pray that God will so end him with the
[28:03] Holy Spirit in the presence that he may
[28:05] be able to bring those men into the
[28:07] presence of God. He doesn't know how
[28:09] many are receiving the Lord Jesus Christ
[28:12] in whatever measure they're able to
[28:14] understand, but there's very intelligent
[28:17] people and men and he's just around the
[28:20] men as that's where he goes and he's
[28:22] done it for years and I just say God
[28:24] bless him. He goes there every goes
[28:26] there every week and has as many
[28:29] services as is as possible. So I just
[28:31] say God bless our brother Roy
[28:33] Shrewsbury.
[28:34] And you know you're here. This is just a
[28:37] a Wednesday evening. We won't say just a
[28:39] Wednesday evening because there is no
[28:41] less important time when God is with his
[28:44] people. You have come. I I began to
[28:48] think and it kind of goes in line with
[28:49] my service tonight. Uh if it wasn't for
[28:53] the grace of God in your lives, who
[28:56] knows where you would be.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; Probably be some of you that may well be
[29:01] incarcerated.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; Some of you wouldn't be living.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; Satan would have cut your life off
[29:07] short.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; Your homes would be broken and children
[29:12] would be tore apart and who knows where
[29:15] you'd be. Some of you would be street
[29:17] people and who knows what condition we'd
[29:20] be in. But here we are
[29:22] &gt;&gt; by the grace of God.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; And it's not it's not something that we
[29:26] should only think about occasionally
[29:28] because every time God spoke to the
[29:30] children of Israel, he told them,
[29:32] "Remember, you are in you were in
[29:35] bondage.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Remember, you were in bondage and I
[29:38] brought you out with a mighty hand. I
[29:40] brought you out." And that's what we
[29:42] want to keep in our thoughts and our
[29:43] minds. Amen. Thank God for redemption.
[29:46] Thank God for Christ. The world is
[29:48] remembering Christmas today, but we are
[29:51] remembering the Christ of Christmas.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; We're not confused about that at all. I
[29:59] don't know whether they made the
[30:00] announcement. Tomorrow night the school
[30:02] is having their Christmas uh
[30:04] presentation, whatever it is, songs and
[30:06] so on. And uh so everyone is invited to
[30:10] be there. We we hardly had enough room
[30:12] for everybody last year, but we'll make
[30:14] room somehow. And so you just come and
[30:17] it's it's delightful to see the purity
[30:20] and the sincerity of the children and
[30:22] the atmosphere that they've been raised
[30:24] in with the principal or brother
[30:26] Timberman's and the teachers. Each one
[30:29] of them I say God bless you. God bless
[30:32] you teachers and God bless all who are
[30:34] making this possible. Without you it
[30:36] wouldn't be possible. And you that give
[30:39] towards it, God bless you. I can tell
[30:41] you that it's a worthy cause.
[30:46] The school system today is filled with
[30:48] devils.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; You might as well know it. We know it.
[30:52] It's filled with devils.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; And you might as well hear it. If your
[30:56] children weren't being taught by the
[30:58] people that we have, there may well be
[31:00] some lesbian teaching them,
[31:02] &gt;&gt; some homosexual teaching them, some
[31:05] perverted vine teaching them, some
[31:08] darkened mind who knows nothing about
[31:10] God. Thank God we have Holy Ghost.
[31:14] filled men and women.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I sure appreciate your
[31:19] support. All right. Uh just uh this
[31:23] announcement will be on the board if you
[31:25] don't get it just now. This coming
[31:28] Sunday, December 23rd will be a morning
[31:31] service, an evening service. I'll be
[31:32] speaking in the morning and brother Tom
[31:34] Ray will be speaking in the evening. Uh
[31:37] Wednesday the 26th. Next Wednesday,
[31:39] there will be no service on Wednesday
[31:42] the 26th.
[31:44] And on Sunday, December the 30th, will
[31:46] be one service in the morning because
[31:50] then on Monday the 31st, service will
[31:54] start. Watch night service will start
[31:55] here at 9:00
[31:58] and we'll go till we're done
[32:01] &gt;&gt; and that we'll go into the new year. So
[32:04] that service will be also in 207 and
[32:07] 208.
[32:10] We don't know just how long it'll go in
[32:12] 208, but we'll be here. And then
[32:15] Wednesday, uh, January the 2nd will be
[32:17] no service because our service will be
[32:19] Monday night and we'll be covering it.
[32:22] And then from, uh, January 2nd from then
[32:25] on will be our our regular time. So, if
[32:28] you didn't get all of those, that's
[32:29] fine. It'll be on the board back there.
[32:32] All right. If you'll take your Bibles
[32:33] and open them to the book of Isaiah,
[32:37] I want to uh read and keep your Bible
[32:40] handy because tonight I intend to uh
[32:44] read quite a bit of scripture and
[32:45] comment on it as we go through. Uh we're
[32:49] going to start with verse one of Isaiah
[32:52] 5 and read down through verse seven.
[32:58] May the Lord bless his word to our
[33:00] heart. Isaiah 5.
[33:07] Now I will sing of I will sing to my
[33:10] well-beloved a song of my beloved
[33:13] touching his vineyard.
[33:16] My beloved hath a vineyard in a very
[33:18] fruitful hill. Now, before we go any
[33:21] further, just so we get a understanding
[33:24] of what we're reading about, God says in
[33:27] verse uh seven, I believe that that his
[33:30] vineyard is the house of Israel. So, the
[33:33] descriptive language that is used here,
[33:36] God is speaking of his people, of his
[33:39] children, Israel.
[33:42] So he said, "Uh, my wellbeloved hath a
[33:45] vineyard in a very fruitful hill, and he
[33:48] fenced it, and gathered out the stones
[33:51] thereof, and planted it with a choicest
[33:54] vine, and built a tower in the midst of
[33:57] it, and also made a wine press therein.
[34:01] And he looked that it should bring forth
[34:03] grapes, and it brought forth wild
[34:05] grapes." And now, oh inhabitants of
[34:08] Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I
[34:12] pray you betwixed me in my vineyard.
[34:14] What could have been done more to my
[34:17] vineyard than I have done in it?
[34:21] Wherefore when I looked uh that it
[34:24] should bring forth grapes, brought it
[34:26] forth wild grapes, and now go to, I will
[34:30] tell you what I will do to my vineyard.
[34:33] I will take away the hedge thereof, and
[34:35] it shall be eaten up, and break down the
[34:38] wall thereof, and it shall be trotten
[34:41] down. And I will lay it waste. It shall
[34:44] not be pruned, nor digged, but there
[34:47] shall come up briars and thorns. I will
[34:50] also command the clouds that they rain
[34:52] no rain upon it. For the vineyard of the
[34:55] Lord is the house is the host of the
[34:59] house of Israel
[35:01] and the men of Judah his pleasant plant.
[35:04] And he looked for judgment, but behold
[35:07] oppression, for righteousness, but
[35:10] behold a cry. Amen. You may have your
[35:15] seats
[35:16] and please keep your Bible open
[35:20] and look at verse four just once again.
[35:25] What could verse four what could have
[35:28] been done more to my vineyard that I
[35:32] have not done to it? And this is what I
[35:34] want to take as a as a thought as a text
[35:37] tonight and a title of this uh service.
[35:41] What more could have been done?
[35:46] I don't want to start where I want to
[35:48] end. But if we bring that phrase, that
[35:53] title down to where we are right today
[35:57] in the age that we're in and the, you
[36:02] know, upon whom the end of the world has
[36:04] come and the and the uh incredible
[36:09] conditions that exist and that we have
[36:11] to face today. And yet, having said all
[36:14] of that,
[36:16] I say, what more could God have done?
[36:22] What more could he have done? Was there
[36:24] anyone else he could have sent? Was
[36:27] there any other spirit that could have
[36:29] come? Would there have been anything
[36:31] else, anything more that God could have
[36:35] done than he already did do? And I'd
[36:38] like to just add to that that I do not
[36:41] believe that God has any regrets. You
[36:44] know, all of us we as humans we have we
[36:48] live with regrets. Every once in a while
[36:52] we uh uh think about something some
[36:55] moment in our lives and we think about
[36:58] if I could have just done something
[37:00] more. if I could have just uh uh you
[37:04] know some regrets are very very
[37:06] difficult to deal with. I had a cousin
[37:09] and uh my cousin first cousin he had uh
[37:13] he had asthma I I I wasn't around him a
[37:17] lot. I wasn't around him when he was
[37:19] suffering a great deal. But I visited
[37:21] his wife some years ago and we stood in
[37:25] the kitchen and there Ukrainian Catholic
[37:28] people and of course as Catholic people
[37:31] they're very easily gripped by guilt and
[37:34] and I say that because I've had a lot of
[37:36] experience with that. Not myself
[37:37] personally but dealing with that. And uh
[37:41] we stood in the kitchen and she
[37:43] described how he came out and and and
[37:46] had this asthma attack and uh of course
[37:50] he'd had Manny. So she, you know, was
[37:55] not real instant upon maybe calling the
[37:59] ambulance or whatever. And before she
[38:01] could get help, he died. He died there
[38:03] on the kitchen floor. And she was living
[38:06] with regret. Uh, I I could have moved
[38:09] faster. I could have taken it more
[38:11] seriously. I should have It cost me his
[38:14] life. It cost me my husband. And I I
[38:17] tried to deal with her and tried to
[38:19] encourage her because, you know, just to
[38:21] get a person to realize you you you it
[38:24] will do you no good to try to live with
[38:26] that regret. Now, you'll only grind
[38:28] yourself down into a condition of
[38:31] perhaps sickness yourself. But she was
[38:34] living with that and had been living
[38:35] with that. Uh uh we all have had some
[38:38] regret. We if id only done more, if id
[38:41] only said this, if I'd only taken more
[38:43] seriously, if id if I could just do it
[38:45] over again.
[38:47] Uh when I was a young boy, I lived in a
[38:50] preacher's home. And he had a son and
[38:53] five children. And to my knowledge, only
[38:57] one of those only one of the five
[38:59] children even made real a real serious
[39:02] attempt to serve God. And I uh he went
[39:07] as a missionary, went to went to uh
[39:11] Taiwan, which was Formosa at the time.
[39:14] And when he came back, he was touring
[39:16] through and I was a young pastor at the
[39:19] time. And and I had him and his wife
[39:21] come and I spoke at the church. And then
[39:24] I met him just outside. Well, he I was
[39:27] almost more like a son to him. I think I
[39:29] was sometimes more of a son to him than
[39:32] his own son because he'd say, "Come on,
[39:34] Eddie." And he'd take a shotgun. He
[39:37] loved to go hunting ducks and things.
[39:39] And we'd go out someplace and and I was
[39:42] even conscious then, you know, he's not
[39:43] taking his son, but he's taking me and
[39:46] we go go out and uh uh along some sloohs
[39:49] or some swamps and and oh, he just loved
[39:53] to do that. Well, we I stepped out of
[39:56] the church and he's standing outside
[40:00] and there I am, you know, a boy that
[40:02] lived in his home and I'm pastoring a
[40:04] church now and he nice little
[40:06] congregation and he he just broke down.
[40:09] The people were all coming out shaking
[40:11] hands. He just broke down and began to
[40:13] weep and he he he just wept. He his
[40:16] shoulders shook and he looked at me and
[40:19] he said, "Oh," he called me Eddie, of
[40:21] course. He said, "Oh, Eddie." Oh. He
[40:23] said, "If I could only do it over again,
[40:26] if I could only do it over again, how
[40:28] different I would have done things." And
[40:30] there he is, a man in his senior years
[40:33] living with some regret. Who knows
[40:35] that's in his heart, but at that moment,
[40:37] whatever the scenario was, whatever he
[40:40] experienced in the service and just, you
[40:43] know, being there with myself, I guess
[40:44] he it all flooded of memories coming
[40:47] back and re regret it. And I can tell
[40:49] you one thing in the great mind of God,
[40:52] he has zero regrets about what he has
[40:55] done.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he gave his best.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Every time he gave his best. That's why
[41:03] Jesus said to Israel, "I've sent you
[41:06] prophets, holy man. I've sent the best."
[41:10] That was the very best that God could do
[41:12] in every generation.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; And so I I want to think about that.
[41:16] What more could he have done?
[41:18] Now there's a a unique condition which
[41:21] exists in our time
[41:24] and the age I like to think about you
[41:27] know the days that you and I are living
[41:28] in. There's a unique condition that
[41:30] exists right now and uh happens to be
[41:34] amongst believers and that is because
[41:38] change
[41:39] change has taken place at such a rapid
[41:43] pace with at at this particular era of
[41:46] our time in the generation that we're
[41:49] living in and I know that everyone would
[41:52] agree that change has been so rapid has
[41:56] has taken place uh so quickly who can
[41:59] hardly keep a breast of it. So
[42:01] consequently, what we have in a
[42:03] congregation such as we are here this
[42:06] evening, we've got people, it used to be
[42:08] that maybe pioneers, you know, they
[42:12] perhaps farmed and pioneered with uh
[42:15] with horses or oxen or whatever more.
[42:18] And they would do that for centuries,
[42:21] centuries after centuries. But here we
[42:23] are. We've gone from the ox cart or from
[42:27] the horse and buggy to the to the
[42:29] astronaut age in one lifetime.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Things have changed very very
[42:35] dramatically. And just in the people
[42:37] that are seated here tonight, there's
[42:39] people here that went with horse and
[42:41] wagon, people here who who you know
[42:44] walked for uh many many miles. people
[42:47] here who went to school maybe in log
[42:50] cabins and went to church as we have in
[42:53] log cabin churches and then and then uh
[42:57] things change so dramatically and so
[42:59] quickly and then you have a whole
[43:01] generation and they know nothing about
[43:03] that. They haven't experienced that.
[43:06] They were uh they've been born and you
[43:08] young people have been born in in homes
[43:10] that have been well provided for. And
[43:13] you step out of the house and step into
[43:15] a nice car or into a warm garage and you
[43:19] don't know anything about that perhaps
[43:21] that hardship that perhaps your parents
[43:24] or your grandparents went through and
[43:26] that all has happened so quickly. And so
[43:29] the question is and you'll see where I'm
[43:31] going in a few in a few minutes. The
[43:33] question is, how do we have a sense of
[43:36] appreciation?
[43:38] How do we appreciate what we have and
[43:41] where we're at? How do we appreciate
[43:44] both materially, but more spiritually?
[43:47] How do we appreciate the cost and and
[43:51] the the hardship that has gone into
[43:54] bringing us to where we are today?
[44:02] We've gone from
[44:05] sparse
[44:06] humble beginnings
[44:09] and hardship in just a not very many
[44:12] years from sparse hardship sparse meager
[44:18] beginnings to plenty in a short period
[44:22] of time. We've come from
[44:26] uh we've gone from as I said a moment
[44:28] ago horse and buggy to jet age. We've
[44:31] we're in a day of inventions which are
[44:34] taking place so quickly and so rapidly
[44:36] that we can scarcely keep track of
[44:39] things. We are at a place where today
[44:43] you can walk into the mall or wherever
[44:46] you want and uh or spiritually pick
[44:50] whatever kind of church you want. You
[44:52] can go from a little wee group in a
[44:54] house or to some mega church with
[44:56] thousands and thousands of people. Just
[44:58] whatever taste a person has, you can
[45:01] gratify your your you know your desire.
[45:06] Whatever pleasure a person desires, it's
[45:09] out there for them.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; You agree with me?
[45:12] &gt;&gt; All right. I just want you to keep
[45:13] following along. And so there are those
[45:16] that have been born and raised in this
[45:18] time and I think it's extremely
[45:21] difficult to perhaps uh relate to the
[45:25] times that uh were uh uh of more
[45:28] difficulty and the times to relate to
[45:31] the times of hardship. Now you might say
[45:34] well why are we you know why are we
[45:36] speaking about this? This doesn't seem
[45:38] to be maybe something of depth in the in
[45:40] the message. Well, I'll tell you, it's
[45:41] very, very deep because
[45:44] God has made a number of references in
[45:48] the scripture, and I'm going to go to
[45:49] them, and they're were really lengthy in
[45:52] the in the scripture reading, so I won't
[45:54] be able to read them all, but God
[45:56] details, and he always tells the people
[45:59] of how he found them and the condition
[46:02] they were in and how he how he conducted
[46:05] them and how he prospered them and how
[46:08] he blessed their fields and blessed
[46:10] their cattle and bless their households.
[46:13] And he's he's reiterating he's reminding
[46:16] them of where they came from and how
[46:19] they got to where they are. And then he
[46:21] and in more than one place he says, "But
[46:23] you forgot.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; You forgot."
[46:27] &gt;&gt; And so God gave the people, he gave them
[46:30] a a an actual a a I would say
[46:37] almost like a recipe. I'm going to have
[46:40] you turn with me to Deuteronomy, the
[46:42] book of Deuteronomy
[46:44] and the and the sixth chapter. I hadn't
[46:48] intended to go here just yet, but I I
[46:50] feel that I will.
[46:53] And we're going to start reading at the
[46:55] first verse.
[46:57] Now, now these are the commandments, the
[47:00] statutes, and the judgments which the
[47:03] Lord your God commanded to teach you
[47:07] to teach you that you might do them in
[47:12] the land whether you go to possess it.
[47:14] So now he's starting off immediately,
[47:16] I'm just going to make comments as I go
[47:18] along. starting off uh immediately that
[47:22] they uh uh that they should teach the
[47:25] commandments and the the statutes of the
[47:29] Lord.
[47:31] And now down through verse three, he's
[47:33] talking about the position that the word
[47:35] should have. And that thou mightest fear
[47:37] the Lord thy God to keep all his
[47:40] statutes and his commandments which I
[47:43] command thee, thou and thy son. Now he's
[47:47] extending it beyond just the parents.
[47:50] Thou and thy son and thy son's son on
[47:54] down to the grandchildren all the days
[47:56] of thy life and that thy days may be
[48:00] prolonged. Hear therefore, O Israel, and
[48:04] observe to do it, that it may be well
[48:07] with thee, and that you may increase
[48:10] mightily, as the Lord God of thy fathers
[48:13] hath promised thee, in the land that
[48:16] flowth with milk and honey. So now just
[48:19] uh you can give me your attention for
[48:20] just a moment. So he's telling them that
[48:23] the land is a land of milk and honey,
[48:25] and indeed it was a land of plenty, a
[48:28] land of milk and honey. So now you must
[48:30] understand right away that I am not
[48:32] saying well because uh you know you've
[48:35] been raised in uh a place where you you
[48:38] haven't uh particularly gone hungry. You
[48:42] haven't uh maybe uh maybe you're not in
[48:45] want. But it doesn't mean that others
[48:47] even in your in your time have not been
[48:50] in want or it it's but it's nothing
[48:53] against the individual. you know, we we
[48:56] you sit in a fine church. Uh uh fine.
[49:00] It's it's not it's not a negative on
[49:02] you. It's nothing uh it's no mark
[49:05] against an individual that you might
[49:07] have things rather easy. But it is a
[49:10] mark against an individual if they're
[49:13] not mindful of what brought them to that
[49:16] place.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; We need to be mindful constantly. And
[49:22] that's why God is saying to the children
[49:24] of Israel, you keep this before your
[49:26] sons and before your son's sons. You
[49:29] keep this in the home. And watch where
[49:32] we go on down to verse four. Here, O
[49:35] Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.
[49:38] And thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[49:40] with all thy heart, with all thy soul,
[49:42] and with all thy might. And these words
[49:45] which I command thee this day shall be
[49:48] in thy heart. They shall be in thy
[49:51] heart, and thou shalt teach them
[49:53] diligently unto thy children, and shalt
[49:56] talk of them when thou sitest in thine
[49:59] house. Do you hear it?
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt talk about these things when
[50:05] you sit in your house, and when thou
[50:07] walst by the way, and when thou liest
[50:10] down, and when thou riseest up. Now, God
[50:14] is not wasting his breath and speaking
[50:17] this through Moses to the children of
[50:19] Israel because this is a secret and this
[50:22] is a key in order. If you have these
[50:26] things before you constantly and you're
[50:29] speaking about them and they're they're
[50:31] in your home and they're on the
[50:33] doorposts and wherever more and the
[50:35] people are constantly having this before
[50:38] them, then they will acquire a an
[50:42] appreciation.
[50:44] It won't be something strange to them.
[50:46] They'll realize what it cost to bring
[50:49] this message to them. what it cost and
[50:52] that others are less uh they're less uh
[50:56] you know they're not as benefited.
[50:58] They're less they're less privileged
[51:01] than perhaps you are. And so because
[51:05] there's a danger there's a danger if
[51:07] everything just becomes so humdrum so
[51:11] common. Oh uh you know the world owes me
[51:14] a living. No the world doesn't owe
[51:16] anybody a living. The fact that we have
[51:18] things the way we have, it's not a
[51:20] negative against you. It's not a mark
[51:22] against you. But if we forget where it
[51:25] came from, if we forget and become
[51:27] unappreciative and unthankful, then it
[51:30] is a mark against us and God is
[51:33] displeased. And I show you in the
[51:35] scripture where he became angry with the
[51:38] people because they forgot the God that
[51:41] brought all of these this goodness upon
[51:43] them. They just revel in the goodness.
[51:46] Oh, everything is so good. Everything's
[51:47] so wonderful. I must be so blessed of
[51:49] God. We're so blessed of God. That's
[51:51] true. But that attitude takes a person
[51:54] away from the real character that God
[51:57] loves. And that's a character where a
[52:00] person loves God with all their heart.
[52:02] You can't love him if you just are uh
[52:05] reveling in all the good things that God
[52:07] We We get like spoiled children.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; You know what's the next good thing
[52:12] that's going to happen? Well, you know,
[52:14] where's the next good thing with with no
[52:16] conscience of what this cost and what
[52:18] people went through and what the others
[52:22] uh endured to bring us to this place.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; I hope I can make it clear and I hope
[52:28] you can receive it.
[52:30] And then we'll just go on a few more u
[52:34] verses here. He says, "And thou shalt
[52:36] bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and
[52:40] they shall be as frontlets between thine
[52:42] eyes, and thou shalt write them upon the
[52:45] posts of thy house, and on thy gates.
[52:48] And it shall be when the Lord thy God
[52:51] shall have brought thee into the land uh
[52:53] which he swear unto thy fathers, to
[52:55] Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give
[52:58] thee great and goodly cities." See, he
[53:01] wants to give that which thou buildest
[53:04] not. And notice please now verse 11.
[53:08] And houses full of all good things which
[53:12] thou fillest not, and wells which thou
[53:16] digest not, and vineyards and olive
[53:19] trees which thou plantest not. When thou
[53:23] shalt have eaten, and be full, then
[53:26] beware, lest thou forget.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; See where it comes? immediately after
[53:33] houses that you didn't fill,
[53:36] &gt;&gt; vineyards that you didn't plant,
[53:39] uh wells that you didn't dig, and all of
[53:42] these things. And when you've received
[53:44] it and you've eaten, and you're full,
[53:47] and everything has just come relatively
[53:50] easy, then beware.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; See, beware lest thou forget the Lord.
[53:58] not necessarily forget where it all came
[54:00] from, but forget the Lord because it all
[54:02] came from him.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; And beware, lest thou forget and forget
[54:07] the Lord which brought thee forth out of
[54:09] the land of Egypt from the house of
[54:11] bondage. See where he's gone? He's gone
[54:13] all all the way back from all of this
[54:16] plenty all the way back to the place of
[54:19] bondage. He wanted the people, he wanted
[54:21] the fathers to tell the children and
[54:24] keep it before the mind. And I believe
[54:26] it's up to the preachers as well. Keep
[54:28] it before the people that this word did
[54:30] not come to us easy on easy street.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Very we need to be very conscious of it.
[54:38] Came through hardship and and brother
[54:41] Brandham talks I've got the quote a
[54:42] little later on. I'll give it to you.
[54:44] I've gone through some many hard battles
[54:47] and it makes a way for you. But just
[54:50] because it makes a way for us, it's not
[54:52] that not that we should forget the hard
[54:54] battle that it caused. See, we've got a
[54:57] message.
[54:59] We've got a glorious message.
[55:02] Wells of water, but we didn't dig it.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; We didn't spend any backbreaking time.
[55:09] We didn't spend you didn't spend hours
[55:11] at night. When brother Bram talks about
[55:14] the time, the times that the night in
[55:18] prayer and wondering what what is this
[55:22] strange life that I have? Not a month,
[55:25] not a week, but even some for years.
[55:28] What is this? And God is doing it not
[55:30] for him,
[55:32] &gt;&gt; but for us.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; For us.
[55:36] We weren't the ones who, you know,
[55:39] labored over the tape recorders and
[55:41] packed them around and carried the tape
[55:44] recorders and hooked all the wires up so
[55:46] we could record every make sure there's
[55:49] a microphone and try and get it working
[55:51] and we know nothing. All we do is take a
[55:53] tape and stick it in and hit the switch.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Are you getting my point?
[56:02] &gt;&gt; We didn't do anything about we've got
[56:04] two people here.
[56:06] a biggest part of their life. Brother
[56:08] and sister Andes,
[56:10] listening to these tapes and getting
[56:13] every comma in every quotation mark and
[56:18] every paragraph
[56:20] starting laboriously,
[56:23] week in and week out and month in and
[56:26] month out. this year, next year, 10
[56:30] years, 20 years, 30 years, 35 years, and
[56:34] more. 35 years, a long time. You just
[56:38] sit here and go out there and just pick
[56:39] up a book and you're not thinking about
[56:42] what it took to dig that well.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; You're not thinking what it took. So,
[56:47] you can just lay your eyes on it and
[56:49] leave through it and say, "Well, I want
[56:50] that." But God remembers where it came
[56:54] from.
[56:56] God remembers even before they could do
[56:58] that the prayer, the groaning, the
[57:03] strain upon the man of God and the
[57:07] conditions that he was under and the
[57:09] resistance that was there and the and
[57:12] the spiritual warfare and the demons of
[57:15] hell that were throwing every gun and
[57:18] every everything they could, all
[57:20] armament against it. And yet someone has
[57:23] to get up with all that nervous state
[57:25] and deliver that word and preach it
[57:28] uncompromisingly so it could finally go
[57:30] onto a recorder and go into a book and
[57:33] have devoted people and bring it on down
[57:36] on down. Trees you didn't plant wells we
[57:39] didn't dig houses we didn't fill up
[57:42] churches we didn't build
[57:47] &gt;&gt; but we just walk. That's fine. It's not
[57:49] a it's nothing against an individual.
[57:51] You can't help that you came on at this
[57:54] season. But the but the thing that I
[57:56] must say to you is don't forget
[57:59] &gt;&gt; beware lest we just think oh you know ho
[58:02] h this just comes this just the way it
[58:04] is and the world owes me this and the
[58:07] ministry owes me this and mothers and
[58:09] fathers and grandfathers they owe me
[58:11] this and God owes me this. No
[58:14] &gt;&gt; no that's not it.
[58:17] You say, "Well, now what is the answer
[58:19] so I don't forget?" You keep it before
[58:21] you all the time and you remember where
[58:24] it came from all the time and you keep
[58:26] your heart tender and you keep it
[58:28] appreciative and say, "Thank God. Thank
[58:30] you, Father. Thank you for the
[58:32] faithfulness. Thank you that you raised
[58:34] up faithful men, faithful women, mothers
[58:37] and dads and faithful individuals. Lord,
[58:40] thank you for the faithful ministers.
[58:42] Thank you, oh God, that we have laborers
[58:45] and people who work.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Even right now as I stand here, we know
[58:53] a number of brothers and along with the
[58:55] brother Chris Peterson, brother Randy
[58:58] Snow, two brothers that are leading in
[59:00] two different directions, but doing this
[59:03] labor at the camp. And well, for some,
[59:06] well, you know, hoham, yeah, it's a
[59:07] camp. And who paid for it? I don't know
[59:10] who paid for it. And you know, it's just
[59:12] I guess the world owes it to me. No,
[59:15] that isn't how it and I just say to the
[59:17] brothers, I said, you know what?
[59:20] We don't do this for yourself.
[59:23] On down the road, that ground will
[59:26] become sacred
[59:28] &gt;&gt; when God by the Holy Spirit comes and
[59:31] touches some darkened, bound soul and
[59:35] delivers them.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It'll be a holy spot for a
[59:39] moment.
[59:41] And that's why you do it.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; That's why we do it.
[1:00:02] I just have this written down. Most
[1:00:05] believers today, and this is not a
[1:00:07] negative, this I don't want you to take
[1:00:09] this in in a in a negative sense, but
[1:00:12] most believers today because because
[1:00:15] there's been such a an enormous
[1:00:18] growth and the word has spread
[1:00:23] and things are changing. Things are
[1:00:26] changing for the ministry. Things are
[1:00:28] the the the demand of the people and the
[1:00:32] requirement of the people is changing.
[1:00:34] It's one of the things I know you
[1:00:35] enjoyed, brother Tim Dodd on Sunday, but
[1:00:39] we spent Monday and we spent all day
[1:00:41] Monday. Well, uh, yeah, probably eight
[1:00:44] or 10 hours just speaking about these
[1:00:47] things because he's singing even in the
[1:00:49] short time from the time he came to the
[1:00:51] knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:00:54] the light of this message.
[1:00:57] And you see he was he was from a
[1:00:59] Pentecostal church and he had so become
[1:01:02] disenchanted.
[1:01:04] He lost his he lost his connection and
[1:01:07] actually he and his wife had both given
[1:01:09] up on it. Not backslid but just given up
[1:01:12] on it. Didn't know where the answer was
[1:01:14] but knew it wasn't there. And then here
[1:01:17] comes the message by their way through
[1:01:20] just a supernatural connection that God
[1:01:23] puts together. But now here he is in a
[1:01:26] short period of time. He said I see
[1:01:27] things are changing so rapidly and and
[1:01:30] you know you see we don't know anything
[1:01:33] about
[1:01:36] uh maybe having we had four years in a
[1:01:39] house.
[1:01:41] You you're not you don't know about that
[1:01:43] but that's nothing against the people.
[1:01:47] Uh we held meetings
[1:01:50] uh in a riding stable,
[1:01:53] many meetings in a riding stable. And my
[1:01:57] platform was a a hayrack wagon. We had
[1:02:01] the pulpit on the hayrack wagon. That
[1:02:03] was in Sister Tammy Laroo's mom and
[1:02:06] dad's farm. And that's where we had
[1:02:08] meetings. Two 300 people, 400 people in
[1:02:11] the writing st. And we had the meetings
[1:02:13] there every year. and then in a
[1:02:16] warehouse and then the YMCA,
[1:02:20] maybe under some cloth canopy in Romania
[1:02:24] or some other place. Now, it's it's
[1:02:26] nothing it's nothing against anybody
[1:02:28] here that you weren't there,
[1:02:32] but and it's nothing against anybody
[1:02:33] here, the young people here, that you
[1:02:35] weren't here with a shovel in your hand
[1:02:37] with the with the mud up to your thighs
[1:02:40] uh when this building here was being
[1:02:42] built. And uh all the work and the labor
[1:02:46] that was done. But all of that happened
[1:02:49] so we could be where we are at and then
[1:02:52] we can say but what now? What what is
[1:02:55] God wanting from me?
[1:02:57] It's God doesn't God's not interested in
[1:03:00] people just coming in you know Wednesday
[1:03:02] Sunday you know uh this is the way it is
[1:03:06] and kind of the world owes me the world
[1:03:09] owes me and God owes me this salvation
[1:03:11] and oh we're just everything's so
[1:03:13] delightful everything is delightful but
[1:03:15] there's something more to it than that
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; and that's where I'm coming to amen
[1:03:24] I'm just going to take my my time I'm
[1:03:26] not going going to be long long tonight,
[1:03:28] but I just want to take it a little
[1:03:29] slower rather than just get a hold of a
[1:03:31] couple of things and kind of preach on
[1:03:33] it.
[1:03:36] There's an inherent danger. I'm going to
[1:03:39] stay close to my notes because I really
[1:03:40] pondered these things deeply this week.
[1:03:43] There's an inherent danger in having the
[1:03:46] blessings without any hardship.
[1:03:49] And it's lest we forget. Isn't it
[1:03:52] wonderful? We live in a free country.
[1:03:55] But you know this freedom didn't come
[1:03:57] cheap.
[1:03:59] A lot of men fought.
[1:04:03] I was just reading.
[1:04:05] Uh and it's it's something that probably
[1:04:07] very very few know about. One of the
[1:04:10] largest
[1:04:12] peacetime explosions that ever took
[1:04:15] place happened in Canada in Halifax
[1:04:18] during the Second World War. How many
[1:04:20] here have heard about the Halifax
[1:04:22] explosion? Wow. Quite a few. Good.
[1:04:27] And there were there were literally
[1:04:31] hundreds and hundreds. I'm reading where
[1:04:33] a doctor and a nurse are trying to serve
[1:04:37] uh trying to help people. And there were
[1:04:40] so many they loaded them on a train to
[1:04:42] take him to another city in in Nova
[1:04:45] Scotia and packed the train that the
[1:04:47] train was so full they couldn't put
[1:04:49] another body in the train. I mean these
[1:04:52] are people I don't want to talk about
[1:04:53] how gruesome it was. But these are
[1:04:55] people who the doctors who's a wartime
[1:04:58] doctor said they've never seen such
[1:05:01] devastating and never saw such wounded
[1:05:03] people. People with the face blown right
[1:05:06] off of them. and they're still alive and
[1:05:08] there they don't even know how to start.
[1:05:10] Don't even know where to begin
[1:05:12] stitching. There isn't enough of
[1:05:13] anything to go around the even the fire
[1:05:16] departments are blasted to demolish to
[1:05:19] nothing and doctors and hospitals are
[1:05:22] destroyed. There's no place to take the
[1:05:24] people. It was just an incredible thing.
[1:05:27] And but that that happened because there
[1:05:29] was ammunitions that were loaded on a
[1:05:32] ship and it came into dock and was hit
[1:05:34] with another ship and the whole thing
[1:05:36] exploded and just thousands of people. I
[1:05:39] think there was over 1,500 almost close
[1:05:41] to 2,000 killed instantly and they
[1:05:45] probably don't even know how many were
[1:05:47] killed. was a huge huge enormous uh
[1:05:51] disaster.
[1:05:53] And uh but then you know we have we have
[1:05:58] a we've just come through November the
[1:06:00] 11th
[1:06:02] and uh we think about
[1:06:05] uh everybody's wore little red poppies
[1:06:09] and there's a little phrase that says
[1:06:10] lest we forget.
[1:06:13] So they want people on the 11th of
[1:06:15] November every year to remember the
[1:06:18] enormous cost to keep America free, to
[1:06:22] keep this country free, to free Europe
[1:06:26] and all the people that suffered. And
[1:06:28] we're not talking about difference of
[1:06:30] armies. They think of the people in
[1:06:32] Russia and Germany and and France and
[1:06:36] England and all those European countries
[1:06:38] and they lost so many so many people.
[1:06:40] We're not here to talk about politics,
[1:06:42] but just to bring bring this to reality.
[1:06:45] You know how many men
[1:06:48] how many men Canada committed? I've
[1:06:50] mentioned it once or twice before, but
[1:06:52] Canada committed more soldiers to the
[1:06:54] Second World War per capita than any
[1:06:58] other nation that was involved in the
[1:07:00] war. Canada with a small population had
[1:07:03] over 1 million I have the actual
[1:07:06] statistics slightly over 1 million
[1:07:10] fighting men and just under half a
[1:07:12] million women that were involved
[1:07:14] directly involved in the forces in the
[1:07:16] war. Now Canada's only uh Canada's only
[1:07:22] uh uh 10% of the US population. So you
[1:07:26] if you were going to take that, you'd
[1:07:28] have to say that the US would have to
[1:07:30] have 10 million fighting men in the
[1:07:33] Second World War, which they didn't
[1:07:34] have. 10 million. We had over 1 million,
[1:07:37] just under 1,100,000
[1:07:40] fighting men in the Second World War and
[1:07:43] lost tens of thousands of men. But you
[1:07:46] take the entire war probably 54 I've
[1:07:50] heard 54 and I've heard 56 million
[1:07:53] people from from all of the armies that
[1:07:56] would be the German army and the Russian
[1:07:58] army and all the armies including I
[1:08:02] believe the Holocaust but lest we forget
[1:08:05] so we're we're we're thinking about that
[1:08:07] think about the
[1:08:10] you know that is incredible but think
[1:08:12] about the martyrs
[1:08:16] We should not forget
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; every one of them gave their lives for
[1:08:21] this gospel
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; and that we could have this Bible in our
[1:08:25] hands today. And we must not forget
[1:08:27] that. That is something that is right
[1:08:29] before God. He doesn't forget a single
[1:08:32] one of those. And we I know that we go
[1:08:34] on. You might say, "Well, this is a very
[1:08:35] strange uh message tonight, but it
[1:08:38] shouldn't be."
[1:08:40] You know, it's not enough that we just
[1:08:41] talk, oh, her wonderful bride and God
[1:08:43] has given us so many blessings and this
[1:08:45] is such a positive gospel. We want to
[1:08:47] remember because I can show you
[1:08:49] scripture chapters where God reminded
[1:08:51] them in detailed what it cost to bring
[1:08:54] them. Remember the bondage that you went
[1:08:56] through. Remember the people that that
[1:08:58] led you out and the kind of the kind of
[1:09:00] leadership that God has given. I think
[1:09:03] these things are absolutely vital
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; for the kind of appreciation that God
[1:09:10] wants. Not just appreciation, but it
[1:09:12] puts us into a place to say, "Lord, what
[1:09:15] do you want me to do?
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; What should I be doing?
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; If they were that diligent in their time
[1:09:22] and in their era, surely there's
[1:09:24] something you have for me.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; What do you want me to do?"
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then when we think of that
[1:09:33] uh I just here's the quote that I was
[1:09:35] referring to earlier in the power of
[1:09:38] transformation. Brother Brandham says,
[1:09:39] "But dear friends, I'm not young like
[1:09:42] you all this morning. But I'm old and
[1:09:45] I've been through many hard battles."
[1:09:47] And by going through those hard battles
[1:09:50] brings you where you are this morning.
[1:09:52] You see, so I'm sure that you understand
[1:09:55] that. And God has put me through it that
[1:09:58] my life might open up a way to say this
[1:10:02] is it. And then now if God had him to
[1:10:05] open up the way for somebody so he could
[1:10:08] say this is it then that's exactly the
[1:10:11] same pattern God wants for you and I. So
[1:10:14] we live a certain life and lay some
[1:10:16] footsteps on the sands of time and can
[1:10:18] say to a neighbor or to a friend or to a
[1:10:21] husband or wife or whatever more here's
[1:10:23] here's the footsteps. Here's the
[1:10:25] footsteps, son, daughter. Here's the
[1:10:27] footsteps, my friend, my peer. Walk in
[1:10:30] these. I've made a way. It's not a not
[1:10:33] an easy way, but it's the right way.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And and then this is it."
[1:10:40] And then you all run over that road, but
[1:10:44] before me, now he's going before him.
[1:10:46] There was someone opened up the way for
[1:10:49] me to go. And we opened up the road for
[1:10:51] one another. And as you see sometime an
[1:10:55] old veteran getting old and his marks
[1:10:57] all over him as Paul said one time, I
[1:11:00] bear in in my body the marks of Jesus
[1:11:03] Christ. How Timothy looked upon those
[1:11:06] marks I guess with reverence as he as he
[1:11:09] committed uh to as he committed to young
[1:11:12] Timothy as he committed the gospel to
[1:11:14] young Timothy.
[1:11:18] I believe that's why we have the Lord's
[1:11:20] table
[1:11:22] because it is that we remember his death
[1:11:26] until he come. And I thought of the song
[1:11:28] that says, "Lead me to Calvary, King of
[1:11:31] my life, I crown thee now. Thine will
[1:11:34] the glory be. Lest I forget thy
[1:11:37] thorncrown brow. Lead me to Calvary.
[1:11:40] Lest I forget Gethsemane. Lest I forget
[1:11:43] thine agony. Lest I forget thy love for
[1:11:47] me, lead me to Calvary. It's something
[1:11:50] we need to keep before us.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; There's a parallel between us and Israel
[1:11:57] in the Bible and that I've described, I
[1:12:00] believe, in the first part of this
[1:12:02] service.
[1:12:04] He's also blessed us with every
[1:12:06] spiritual blessing and material
[1:12:08] blessings. The scripture tells us in
[1:12:11] Ephesians 1 and3, "Blessed be the God
[1:12:14] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
[1:12:17] hath blessed us with all spiritual
[1:12:20] blessings in heavenly places in Christ."
[1:12:25] And notice the three words. Now, this is
[1:12:27] in Deuteronomy.
[1:12:29] We won't read the chapter, but the 32nd
[1:12:32] chapter of Deuteronomy is very much like
[1:12:34] the sixth chapter and also the eighth
[1:12:37] chapter. God is telling them to be
[1:12:39] mindful. But in the 32nd chapter, I'm
[1:12:42] just going to uh turn to a couple verses
[1:12:45] here in that because I want to bring to
[1:12:48] a in the 32nd chapter.
[1:13:02] God speaks and says, "Do ye thus
[1:13:05] reququit the Lord uh oh foolish people
[1:13:08] and unwise? Is not he thy father?" Now,
[1:13:11] he's starting to ask uh and there's
[1:13:14] three things that I want to bring out of
[1:13:16] the last half of verse six. Is he not
[1:13:19] thy father?
[1:13:21] Is not thy father that brought uh
[1:13:24] brought thee that bought thee? Let me
[1:13:27] start that again.
[1:13:30] Is not he thy father? This is in verse
[1:13:33] six. That hath bought thee, that's
[1:13:36] number one. Hath he not made thee?
[1:13:40] That's number two. And established thee.
[1:13:43] That's number three. Then he goes on
[1:13:46] with verse seven. Remember the days of
[1:13:48] old. Consider the years of many
[1:13:50] generations.
[1:13:52] Ask thy father and he will show thee thy
[1:13:55] elders and they will tell thee. And I
[1:13:57] just want to stop there for a moment.
[1:14:01] God speaking to the people. He's
[1:14:03] speaking as a very very uh clear
[1:14:09] very very clear parallel between where
[1:14:12] they were and who God was addressing
[1:14:15] because he was addressing people. He was
[1:14:17] saying, you know, ask your father and
[1:14:19] speak to them and see what it was like
[1:14:23] back there. See, because there was
[1:14:25] something he was trying to make a point
[1:14:27] with them, and show thee and thy elders,
[1:14:31] and they will tell thee. When the Most
[1:14:34] High, now this is what he's talking
[1:14:35] about. When the Most High divided the
[1:14:37] nations uh their inheritance, when he
[1:14:41] separated the sons of Adam, and he set
[1:14:44] the bounds of the people according to
[1:14:46] the number of the children of Israel,
[1:14:48] for the Lord's portion is his people.
[1:14:51] Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. He
[1:14:54] found him in a desert land. He's
[1:14:56] describing the process and where they
[1:14:58] came from. We found him in a desert land
[1:15:01] and in a waste howling wilderness. And
[1:15:04] he led him about. He instructed him. He
[1:15:07] kept him as the apple of his eye. As an
[1:15:11] eagle stirth up her nest, flutterth over
[1:15:14] her young, spreadth abroad her wings,
[1:15:16] taketh them, and beareth them on her
[1:15:18] wings. So the Lord alone did lead him,
[1:15:22] and there was no strange God with him.
[1:15:25] He made him to ride on the high places
[1:15:27] of the earth, that he might eat the
[1:15:30] increase of the fields, and he made him
[1:15:32] to suck honey out of the rock and oil
[1:15:35] out of the flinty rock. So you I just
[1:15:37] want to stop there for a moment. God
[1:15:39] wasn't saying, "Now you should feel
[1:15:41] condemned. You should feel badly that
[1:15:43] you've eaten the fat of kind and that
[1:15:46] you've sucked honey out of the rock and
[1:15:48] that you've had all these one that I
[1:15:49] bore you up and when you had trouble I
[1:15:52] was there to deliver you and he didn't
[1:15:55] want them to feel bad about that. He was
[1:15:57] happy. He wanted to do that. That was
[1:15:59] his program. He wanted to bless them. He
[1:16:02] wants to bless the people. In other
[1:16:04] words, in this day, he wants to give
[1:16:06] revelation upon revelation. He wants his
[1:16:09] people to be fattened on the word of
[1:16:11] God. He wants the ministry to come
[1:16:13] behind the pulpit and have a rich load
[1:16:16] to uh un un uh to to give out to the
[1:16:20] people. He wants that. He wants us to
[1:16:22] have honey in the rock. He wants us to
[1:16:24] be healed when we're sick. He wants us
[1:16:27] to have He wants us to have victory over
[1:16:29] the enemy when it comes in like a flood
[1:16:31] and have a the Lord raise up a standard.
[1:16:34] He wants that. Hallelujah. He wants
[1:16:36] that. He wants us to see answers to our
[1:16:39] prayers. He wants to see the impossible
[1:16:42] happen. But he doesn't want us to forget
[1:16:44] where it came from.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Lest we forget,
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; where it came from. Because that is the
[1:16:51] nub. That is the critical. That's the
[1:16:54] pivotal point right there. And it keeps
[1:16:56] coming in scripture after scripture,
[1:16:58] scripture after scripture.
[1:17:01] And I get around in the message a lot. I
[1:17:03] preach in a lot of different places.
[1:17:06] And uh I just spoke to my wife as we
[1:17:09] were coming to church. She doesn't know
[1:17:11] what I going to speak on at any time. I
[1:17:14] never discuss it. But sometime I'll just
[1:17:17] say something that's you know on my
[1:17:19] heart and I'm pondering very very deep
[1:17:24] you know
[1:17:26] uh
[1:17:28] we've spoken and even made public
[1:17:32] that uh there are many many of the
[1:17:35] prophets messages
[1:17:37] that you have never read
[1:17:40] because they've not been printed.
[1:17:45] But
[1:17:48] you know, I've gone to places where they
[1:17:50] haven't had I've got I've got some
[1:17:52] handwritten
[1:17:54] translations in books. I've been with
[1:17:58] people where they wrote them on paper,
[1:18:01] brown paper bags. I have pieces of paper
[1:18:04] where they wrote them. And then they
[1:18:06] came to church and then this brother
[1:18:08] would give it to the next sister or next
[1:18:11] brother and then they would exchange a
[1:18:13] page so they could read those pages of
[1:18:15] what the prophet said and then they
[1:18:17] would bring those pages that next
[1:18:19] meeting and exchange them and that's how
[1:18:21] they got a book read.
[1:18:24] But I said to my wife, I said, "You
[1:18:26] know, it's really amazing. there's
[1:18:28] something that's kind of come over the
[1:18:29] people and you could say, you know,
[1:18:32] there's hundreds of messages you've
[1:18:33] never read.
[1:18:37] Maybe no one comes forward and says, I
[1:18:41] must have that. What did he say?
[1:18:45] I've got How could I get that?
[1:18:49] Do you know why that isn't was because,
[1:18:51] you know, we kind of got enough and I'm
[1:18:55] okay.
[1:18:57] I I'm I'm I'm wellfed.
[1:19:00] We've got plenty.
[1:19:03] Somebody say, "Amen."
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; And the first time that this began to
[1:19:10] come to my mind and began to grind
[1:19:13] within me, just like a dynamo when we
[1:19:16] were in Brazil and I'm trying to stir up
[1:19:20] the brothers. You only got 200 messages.
[1:19:24] Yes. And he said, "Many of those aren't
[1:19:25] accurate because the brother who was
[1:19:28] translating them was living in sin."
[1:19:31] I said, "What?
[1:19:37] Why are you Why aren't you just
[1:19:40] translating those yourself? You've got
[1:19:42] expert brothers here. Why aren't you
[1:19:45] translating?" Well, you know, it's it's
[1:19:47] he's a very senior man and so I said,
[1:19:50] "Forget him. I make no apology. forget
[1:19:53] him.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Begin to translate this thing
[1:19:56] accurately.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Translate it clearly. You've got good
[1:20:00] people give. But to find, you know, that
[1:20:03] to find that
[1:20:06] kind of spirit, I'll call it worship in
[1:20:08] a worship in a double garage spirit or
[1:20:11] preach in a barn spirit or lay on a on a
[1:20:16] dirt floor spirit. something something
[1:20:19] that's away from the ease of the
[1:20:22] message. You might say, "Well, but but
[1:20:25] uh and I'm going to make it just as
[1:20:27] clear as I can. It's not a negative
[1:20:29] thing. It's not that God expected
[1:20:31] anything less." Says, "You came in a a
[1:20:34] time of blessing." That's wonderful.
[1:20:36] We're here in a time of blessing. God
[1:20:38] expects us to appreciate it. He wants us
[1:20:40] to have it, but he doesn't want us to
[1:20:42] forget. And the reason he doesn't want
[1:20:44] us to forget where it came from is
[1:20:46] because it will inspire within us. We'll
[1:20:49] become invigorated
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; to some hardship ourselves. Say, "What
[1:20:54] kind of hardship?" Well, maybe it'll be
[1:20:55] some midnight oil.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; You know what midnight oil is? That's
[1:21:00] staying up late and studying and reading
[1:21:06] and becoming I I've got to know.
[1:21:09] Sometime people call me and say, "What
[1:21:10] did Brother Brandham say about this?"
[1:21:12] Well, why don't you read it and find out
[1:21:13] what he said?
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; They want the preacher to do it all.
[1:21:18] Say, "Well, I got a question about
[1:21:20] this." Well, you got a message and you
[1:21:21] got an education. Read it yourself.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Briscoll, what a way to treat
[1:21:27] the people. Oh my goodness. That this
[1:21:30] hasn't even started.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Are you all right, brother? Or should we
[1:21:36] pray for you?
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; You going to be all right? Okay.
[1:21:40] That sounded like it was that cough is
[1:21:42] pretty vicious there.
[1:21:45] Amen.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Isn't this wonderful?
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; I'm just feeling great.
[1:22:02] He says, what I'm just going back
[1:22:04] reiterating a wee bit.
[1:22:07] Moses. God is speaking through Moses and
[1:22:09] saying to the people, "I bought you.
[1:22:12] You're my inheritance.
[1:22:14] You belong to me. I have acquired you.
[1:22:18] And furthermore, I am creating you."
[1:22:21] That's exactly what the word in Hebrew
[1:22:22] is. I bought you. I'm creating you.
[1:22:26] You're actually my possession.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; And you're my redemption. You You're
[1:22:30] You're the ones I've redeemed. So, I owe
[1:22:33] I I own you. Then he says, "I bought
[1:22:36] you. He said, "Is not he that your
[1:22:39] father? Is he your father?
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; He bought you."
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're not your own.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not. No, you've been bought with a
[1:22:47] price.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; You've been bought with the blood of
[1:22:50] Jesus Christ.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; And the world is remembering Christmas
[1:22:54] right now. Do you know what Christmas
[1:22:55] is? We we we uh Christmas is whatever
[1:22:59] they want to make it as a pagan holiday.
[1:23:01] But to us, even though we know that
[1:23:03] Christ didn't come at this time of the
[1:23:04] season, but that doesn't take away from
[1:23:06] the fact that Christmas to us is when
[1:23:08] God commenced. And brother Bram says by
[1:23:11] the Holy Spirit, which Matthew says in
[1:23:13] chapter 2, God began a creation in the
[1:23:16] virgin womb of Mary.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Mary who gave the body.
[1:23:21] Brother Brandham says God gave the body.
[1:23:24] A body hast thou prepared me? God
[1:23:27] created that body
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; and God created that cell because he was
[1:23:33] starting a new creation.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; And you, how many here could raise their
[1:23:37] hands or be most of the people in the in
[1:23:39] the congregation I would hope would
[1:23:41] would be able to raise their hands and
[1:23:42] say, "I have been born again." You've
[1:23:45] been born by that seed that was created
[1:23:48] in the womb of Mary. That was the
[1:23:51] beginning, the prophet said, of a new
[1:23:53] creation. That was the beginning of a
[1:23:55] new creation. And you're an extension of
[1:23:57] that creation.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; That's why he didn't live to himself.
[1:24:02] Lest I forget. Think about it. What a
[1:24:04] cost. He didn't live according to his
[1:24:06] own desires. He lived
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; and what he saw the father do. That's
[1:24:10] what he did.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; So he bought he bought us. And then the
[1:24:17] scripture says that he he made us. Now
[1:24:21] he made us a new creation. I just want
[1:24:23] to quote I want to only be another few
[1:24:25] minutes. please.
[1:24:27] But here's a quote I I you've heard many
[1:24:30] times, but just listen to how it goes
[1:24:32] right now from the late of the same
[1:24:33] church age. It speaks about Christ
[1:24:36] standing
[1:24:38] and he's he's standing there revealing
[1:24:41] who he is in this in this last age. I
[1:24:44] have something I just have to come to.
[1:24:46] He's the author of the creation of God.
[1:24:51] And this is another creation.
[1:24:55] Oh, I wish we could really grasp this.
[1:24:57] This has to do with the church. This is
[1:25:00] a special designation of himself. He is
[1:25:03] the creator of that church. The heavenly
[1:25:06] bridegroom created his own bride. As the
[1:25:10] spirit of God, he came down and created
[1:25:13] in the virgin Mary the cells from which
[1:25:16] his body was born. Of him it is said,
[1:25:20] "Lo, a body hast thou father prepared
[1:25:23] me." God, not Mary, provided the body.
[1:25:27] Mary was the incubator and God provided
[1:25:31] the body.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; That God by that same seed, that's
[1:25:36] exactly the same seed by which we are
[1:25:39] born because we are we've been created
[1:25:41] in him. And brother Brandham takes that
[1:25:43] scripture, for we are his workmanship
[1:25:46] created with Christ. But he takes it and
[1:25:48] he just puts these words together. For
[1:25:51] we are his workmanship, created in union
[1:25:54] with Christ Jesus unto good works.
[1:25:57] Ephesians 2 and10. And then in Ephesians
[1:26:00] 4:24, and that ye put on the new man
[1:26:04] which after God is created in
[1:26:06] righteousness and true holiness. Oh my.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; He said this is the He said the new
[1:26:15] creation is not the old creation made
[1:26:19] over. You came into the world. You were
[1:26:22] born in sin and shapen in iniquities.
[1:26:25] God has not taken you and simply made
[1:26:28] you over or patched you up.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; You are a new creation.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; I have bought you.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; I have made you.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what he said to his
[1:26:40] people. And I have established thee. I
[1:26:42] have bought thee. Can you say amen?
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; I have made thee.
[1:26:48] and I have established thee.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; And that is why he's zealous and jealous
[1:26:53] over his people, over his children. He
[1:26:56] wants to give them the fruit of the
[1:26:58] land. He wants to give them milk and
[1:26:59] honey. He wants to give them victory. He
[1:27:02] wants you to have it.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. He But he never wants you to
[1:27:06] forget. Even though maybe you said,
[1:27:07] "I've been raised in a good home. I
[1:27:09] never knew the wounds and the pangs and
[1:27:12] the marks of sin." God bless you. And
[1:27:15] you don't need to have it. Don't ever
[1:27:17] let the devil tell you, "I've got to go
[1:27:19] out in the world and I've got to sew my
[1:27:21] wild oats." You don't need that. You
[1:27:23] don't need that. Those chains and bonds
[1:27:26] of of Satan upon you. You don't need it.
[1:27:28] You have to remember where God delivered
[1:27:31] your parents from, your mother and
[1:27:33] father from. You got to remember the
[1:27:36] bondage of the world. And that's no. All
[1:27:38] you have to do is walk the street and
[1:27:39] you can see it right away. And you and
[1:27:42] and God wants you to say, "Thank God I
[1:27:45] never had to experience this.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Thank God delivered my forefathers out
[1:27:51] of Egypt, out of we came out of bondage.
[1:27:55] Thank God I can suck milk and honey out
[1:27:58] of the rock. Thank God that I have this
[1:28:01] wonderful liberty and freedom."
[1:28:07] I want to speak on on Sunday morning on
[1:28:11] the great blessings
[1:28:13] that have come with what we call the
[1:28:15] light. I want to speak of the light of
[1:28:17] freedom,
[1:28:19] the light of riches and the light of all
[1:28:22] the benefits and the blessings that God
[1:28:24] has blessed, shall we say, America,
[1:28:26] North America with. God has blessed it.
[1:28:29] God has given it.
[1:28:31] You got more food in your house than you
[1:28:32] can eat.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Isn't that true?
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; That is true.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Is that something that God is holding
[1:28:48] against you? Not at all.
[1:28:52] But while that you're going to have a
[1:28:54] fine home, you're going to go and turn a
[1:28:55] thermostat on. You might say, "Well,
[1:28:57] this isn't very deep. This is very deep.
[1:29:02] because this either genders and brings
[1:29:04] forth a thanksgiving to God. And that's
[1:29:07] why God in search right in that
[1:29:08] scripture, love the Lord thy God with
[1:29:11] all thy heart, with all thy soul, with
[1:29:13] all thy mind. I tell you what, we we
[1:29:16] really quite frankly, I don't believe we
[1:29:18] understand that scripture. I'm talking
[1:29:20] about loving God with all your strength
[1:29:22] and all your energy and all your being
[1:29:24] and all that you can be and ever will
[1:29:26] be.
[1:29:35] He made us. He has fashioned us.
[1:29:38] He's accomplished us. He's established
[1:29:40] us.
[1:29:42] Made us establish us to be firm and be
[1:29:44] stable. You know, friends, you're here
[1:29:46] on a Wednesday evening. Do you know
[1:29:47] there's a lot of people that aren't
[1:29:49] here?
[1:29:51] There's people that's completely that f
[1:29:53] sat in the same seat you sit in. They're
[1:29:54] totally backslid.
[1:29:56] I wouldn't point my finger at them at
[1:29:58] all. They are what they are. What
[1:30:00] they've gone in the direction that
[1:30:01] they've gone and for whatever reason
[1:30:03] they've gone there. But just think about
[1:30:05] it. What's the difference between you
[1:30:06] and them? Nothing. Just the grace of
[1:30:07] God.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; You're just here because of the grace of
[1:30:10] God.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for the grace of God, you'd
[1:30:13] be out there.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; That's all it is.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; It's just the grace of God. say, "Well,
[1:30:20] there's people that's going to be out
[1:30:22] here on this pagan holiday of of of
[1:30:25] Christmas and just wearing their shoe
[1:30:28] leather out, going from one store to the
[1:30:30] other, buying things that people don't
[1:30:31] need and that that their loved ones
[1:30:33] aren't going to appreciate."
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; It's not true.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Yet, Brother Brandham received Christmas
[1:30:40] gifts. He received it from his church,
[1:30:43] received it from other brothers,
[1:30:44] received candy, received suits, received
[1:30:46] all kinds of things. But the thing was
[1:30:48] that didn't take Christ out of
[1:30:49] Christmas.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Christ is the focal part.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; He's the whole reason that there is such
[1:30:56] a such a time as this. And the world can
[1:30:58] go and do their own thing, but we're not
[1:31:00] a part of that.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; I hope you can get a balance on that.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; What more he asks
[1:31:14] could he do?
[1:31:18] Beware that you forget not.
[1:31:21] What more could I do? He asked the
[1:31:24] people that more than once.
[1:31:28] He asked why they have forgotten.
[1:31:31] What could I have done more? What more
[1:31:33] could have been done?
[1:31:35] As I said right at the beginning of the
[1:31:37] service, God has no regrets.
[1:31:40] He's never going to have to say God's
[1:31:42] never going to say, "Oh, I'm so sorry,
[1:31:44] Cloverdale." By the way,
[1:31:47] If id only sent somebody else this your
[1:31:49] way. Oh,
[1:31:53] he's got he'll have no regrets.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; He's going to say Cloverdale Bible way.
[1:31:59] Whoever you are from wherever you've
[1:32:01] been, he's going to say, "What more
[1:32:03] could I have done?"
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; All you had to do was keep it before
[1:32:07] your children. Keep it before your
[1:32:09] grandchildren. Put it on the doorpost.
[1:32:11] Put it on the fridge. Put it wherever
[1:32:12] you put it. Here's what here's what he
[1:32:15] did here. Here's the signs. Here's the
[1:32:18] pillar. Think about it. The same pillar
[1:32:21] of fire.
[1:32:23] You need it before you all the time. The
[1:32:25] same pillar of fire is going to meet you
[1:32:26] when you come into church the next time.
[1:32:28] The same pillar of fire is going to lead
[1:32:30] you when you go home out of church
[1:32:31] tonight.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; It really is.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; You need to keep that in front of you.
[1:32:36] Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; You need to actually feel that and sense
[1:32:39] that so that you can say,
[1:32:42] "Thank you, Father.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; You bought me
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; and you've given me this rich,
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; glorious
[1:32:51] truth
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; for me to walk in." And when you see the
[1:32:55] world going, "Thank you, Father. You've
[1:32:58] established me. I don't have to run with
[1:33:00] that crowd. I don't have to go there for
[1:33:03] my pleasure. Thank you, Father.
[1:33:07] I you possessed me. You own me and I'm
[1:33:10] yours entirely.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, you watch it. Then God start pouring
[1:33:15] out more blessing upon blessing and you
[1:33:18] give yourself to him and he gives
[1:33:20] himself to you.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close with this. Even
[1:33:25] though I'm a long ways from being done,
[1:33:27] I'm going to close with this.
[1:33:30] I believe that God always gave his best.
[1:33:33] I'm going to close where I want to start
[1:33:35] on Sunday.
[1:33:38] Brother Brandham says very clearly
[1:33:42] this age
[1:33:44] was a dark dismal age
[1:33:49] and when the seven church ages
[1:33:52] were drawn out and by the Holy Spirit
[1:33:55] were drawn out on the back wall and
[1:33:58] brother Brandham says I left I left a
[1:34:01] little sliver of light
[1:34:05] but he says Leodyus totally blackened
[1:34:07] out, totally dark, totally black because
[1:34:12] Christ was put outside of the church.
[1:34:14] Brother Baron said, "I left a little
[1:34:16] light there."
[1:34:18] God used that servant
[1:34:22] to leave a little light
[1:34:24] in this generation.
[1:34:26] I want you to think real deep now. and
[1:34:29] took him off the scene.
[1:34:32] The messenger,
[1:34:34] the signs that he would do, seeing the
[1:34:39] light and the pillar of fire over this
[1:34:41] man or over this woman,
[1:34:44] we don't have that.
[1:34:47] This one who was there is exactly here.
[1:34:50] There's nothing different. And he has
[1:34:53] said that you ladies
[1:34:56] working perhaps in your kitchen,
[1:34:59] you're a servant of Christ.
[1:35:02] You brothers doing what you're doing and
[1:35:04] being led of the Holy Spirit, you're
[1:35:05] servants of Christ. Whether we're a
[1:35:07] farmer, whether we're a preacher,
[1:35:08] whether we're plumber, electrician,
[1:35:10] whatever, we're servants of Christ.
[1:35:14] He gave us the designation that you are
[1:35:16] the bride of Jesus Christ. We've heard
[1:35:17] that. Oh, we've heard that. We can
[1:35:19] almost go to sleep on that.
[1:35:22] But let me say this to you.
[1:35:27] If God could have done anything better
[1:35:34] to this age of people in 207 going into
[1:35:38] 208
[1:35:40] because God is going to have those
[1:35:41] people before him, too.
[1:35:44] All these people that are going to go
[1:35:46] into the new year
[1:35:48] along with you, God's going to have them
[1:35:51] before him one day. And you know what
[1:35:54] he's going to be able to tell them? What
[1:35:57] more could I do? Because I gave you the
[1:36:00] very best there was.
[1:36:04] And in case you don't think that you are
[1:36:07] the very best that God could leave this
[1:36:10] generation, then you have to tell me
[1:36:13] your conclusion is that God's going to
[1:36:15] have some regrets.
[1:36:17] He's going to have to say to a group of
[1:36:19] people, "I'm so sorry. I could have
[1:36:22] given you something better
[1:36:24] than the bride of Jesus Christ. I could
[1:36:28] have given you a brighter light, but I
[1:36:30] didn't do it. I could have given you a
[1:36:32] more correct example of who I am. I
[1:36:36] could have given you a better a better
[1:36:39] expression
[1:36:41] of Christ and I held it back. I didn't
[1:36:44] do it. God's not going to have to say
[1:36:45] that.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Because you're here tonight.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; This happens to be my message to you.
[1:36:55] That sliver of light
[1:36:57] that God has left in this generation
[1:37:03] is what God had in his mind before the
[1:37:05] very foundation of the world. And he
[1:37:07] could say to Leia to see, I left you the
[1:37:09] very best.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; It was adequate.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; It was more than adequate.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; It was abundantly clear.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; I left you a message. I left you a
[1:37:21] testimony. I left it lived out. I left
[1:37:23] it proclaimed. I left it preached.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And that, my brother, my sister, I'm
[1:37:30] closing this service on that. That
[1:37:32] sliver of light, if that wasn't the
[1:37:35] best, then it wasn't the best 50 years
[1:37:37] ago.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Then the messenger and the message
[1:37:41] wasn't the best. And if that wasn't the
[1:37:44] best, then the martyrs died in vain and
[1:37:45] they weren't the best. And if they
[1:37:47] weren't the best, then Paul and the
[1:37:49] apostles weren't the best. And if they
[1:37:51] weren't the best, Jesus wasn't the best.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, far be it from that,
[1:37:56] brother Ed." We never never say that. If
[1:37:58] Jesus was the best, then the revealing
[1:38:01] of that same Jesus in this hour in a
[1:38:04] people that the prophet of God said is
[1:38:06] the bride is the is the bridegroom in
[1:38:09] bride form. It's Jesus Christ in bride
[1:38:12] form, not Jesus Christ watered down. I
[1:38:15] don't care what you think about
[1:38:16] yourself. I don't care how negative you
[1:38:18] are on yourself. I don't care what kind
[1:38:19] of problems you're experiencing. You
[1:38:22] happen to be God's choice
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; in this age and you happen to be what
[1:38:28] the prophet of God called a sliver of
[1:38:30] light. You're a sliver of light to this
[1:38:32] dark world.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; And if God could have done something
[1:38:38] better, he would have done something
[1:38:40] better. He hasn't got a better voice. He
[1:38:43] hasn't got a better life. He hasn't got
[1:38:45] a better light. You are the light of
[1:38:47] this generation.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; And he wants you to believe that.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; He wants you to walk like that.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; He wants you to quote that. He wants you
[1:39:04] to repeat that. He wants that to be the
[1:39:06] theme of your thoughts.
[1:39:10] When you walk out of here tonight and
[1:39:12] you go amongst the people and whether
[1:39:14] you're amongst your unsaved friends or
[1:39:16] whatever it is and the people you're in
[1:39:17] contact with, that's what's supposed to
[1:39:19] flow through you. And don't think
[1:39:21] anything else. Don't let Satan rob you
[1:39:23] of that.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; And we don't ne we don't just settle
[1:39:28] back in, you know, kind of a rocking
[1:39:31] chair attitude and oh, God just gave us
[1:39:34] all the best because he had to give us
[1:39:35] all the best. That's not so. He gave us
[1:39:38] what he gave us so we could be the best.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; So we could be something we couldn't be
[1:39:43] any other way.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:39:48] Right in the face of the devil. I say
[1:39:50] glory be to God.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; This is the Lord's doing. This is the
[1:39:54] Lord's doing and it's glorious in our
[1:39:56] eyes.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Pray for Sunday. Would you please?
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank him.
[1:40:07] Hallelujah.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; I got a couple of things I want to sing.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to sing?
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; It's one thing you find out about
[1:40:21] Brother Ed. It takes me 55 minutes to
[1:40:24] get to my subject and then the last five
[1:40:26] I preach it.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Let's sing. Let the lower lights be
[1:40:34] burning.
[1:40:37] Why don't we stand to our feet? Let
[1:40:40] everybody sing it to the glory of God. I
[1:40:44] appreciate you. I thank you for being
[1:40:46] here. I appreciate your prayers. Keep
[1:40:48] praying for us, will you? For myself,
[1:40:51] for those that minister.
[1:40:54] Amen.
[1:40:56] Amen.
[1:40:58] [Music]
[1:41:03] Let's start with the first verse,
[1:41:05] please. Brightly beamed,
[1:41:12] the light comes ever
[1:41:17] to us. He keeping
[1:41:21] all the light
[1:41:24] upon the shore.
[1:41:26] Let the
[1:41:29] lights be burning.
[1:41:32] Send the
[1:41:34] across the
[1:41:38] fainting
[1:41:39] struggling.
[1:41:42] You may resue,
[1:41:44] you may save.
[1:41:48] Dark the night of sin has settled.
[1:41:53] While the angry
[1:41:56] bills roar
[1:42:00] our watching longore
[1:42:05] [Music]
[1:42:11] be
[1:42:15] across the wings
[1:42:21] [Music]
[1:42:22] You may rescue,
[1:42:25] you may
[1:42:29] trip your
[1:42:31] laugh, my brother
[1:42:33] sound
[1:42:40] [Music]
[1:42:43] in the dark.
[1:42:48] Let the Lord
[1:42:50] lights be burning
[1:42:53] the glee across the way
[1:43:00] struggling.
[1:43:02] You may
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; I had an interesting conversation this
[1:43:09] last week
[1:43:11] with a businessman who's a large
[1:43:15] contractor. He's the president
[1:43:19] and he has been uh chosen to build a new
[1:43:22] building in downtown Vancouver
[1:43:25] for the gospel mission. And for any of
[1:43:27] you who've ever noticed in the
[1:43:29] newspaper, if you've gotten a Vancouver
[1:43:31] newspaper from time to time, the Gospel
[1:43:33] Mission
[1:43:35] feeds the hungry off the street,
[1:43:38] provides beds for the homeless, and
[1:43:41] they've done this, I think, for maybe
[1:43:43] 60, 70 years or more.
[1:43:46] So they needed to build a new building
[1:43:48] and this contractor had agreed to build.
[1:43:50] He told me it took five years just to
[1:43:52] get a building permit. Five years.
[1:43:55] Because there are people who have
[1:43:56] resisted it. People who are greedy
[1:43:59] because they feel at this uh this level
[1:44:01] of
[1:44:03] of humanity.
[1:44:06] And these homeless people, they depress
[1:44:09] the price of their land and their
[1:44:10] property and their homes. And they don't
[1:44:12] want them. They say, "Let them go out to
[1:44:14] Langley. let them go. And they've been
[1:44:15] fighting and struggling for five years
[1:44:18] in the city council
[1:44:20] to get a building permit. He said, "We
[1:44:23] were four hours just Monday night in the
[1:44:27] Vancouver council and we got permission
[1:44:30] to build this building after 5 years. We
[1:44:33] got permission." He said, "And the same
[1:44:35] people and one woman was there who has
[1:44:37] carried the banner in opposition and
[1:44:39] she's opposed this from day one and
[1:44:41] she's been a spokesman for other people
[1:44:44] and so on and managed to get the thing
[1:44:46] stalled and stalled and stalled."
[1:44:49] And he said there's a bunch of people
[1:44:50] that got up and spoke, but he said a
[1:44:53] 15year-old girl got up and all these
[1:44:56] people were describing these homeless
[1:44:59] people and the street people and these
[1:45:01] people who have not had the life that
[1:45:04] you and I have had.
[1:45:09] And this 15-year-old girl got up after
[1:45:12] they had described once again this low
[1:45:15] end of humanity and who they are and
[1:45:18] what they are and we want them out of
[1:45:20] here. Clean the place up.
[1:45:23] This 15year-old girl got up and went to
[1:45:25] the microphone before the whole city
[1:45:26] council and all those people that were
[1:45:28] there in council chambers and she said,
[1:45:32] "I don't know
[1:45:35] where these people live, but I live
[1:45:38] right across the street from the Union
[1:45:40] Gospel
[1:45:42] place."
[1:45:44] And she says, "And I know the people and
[1:45:48] I know the kind of people that go in
[1:45:50] there." And she says, "I've lived here
[1:45:52] since I've been 8 years old. And I feel
[1:45:55] the safest when I walk that block where
[1:45:59] the Union Gospel place is. I feel the
[1:46:03] safest when I'm there. And so I've
[1:46:05] always walked in front of that block.
[1:46:08] And she says, "And I've been in there
[1:46:10] and I know the people." And she says,
[1:46:12] "They're good people and they're nice
[1:46:14] people." And she said, "That is where I
[1:46:17] have felt the safest."
[1:46:21] One of the council members spoke up and
[1:46:24] he said, "This girl
[1:46:26] has changed our mind.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; And we're going to give passage for this
[1:46:32] place to be built."
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; I thought that was remarkable.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; You know what? She had no axe to grind.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; She just told the truth
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; out of a sincere heart.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Just told the way it was. You young
[1:46:49] people here, you think you don't she she
[1:46:51] persuaded an entire city council
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; at 15 years old. And I thought that was
[1:46:56] a very touching story. And I was able to
[1:46:59] witness to that president of that
[1:47:02] company. I was able to witness to him
[1:47:04] how this church started and you people
[1:47:08] and what is here and what God is doing
[1:47:11] today and it also touched his heart.
