[0:41] I think we can sing that one more time.
[0:45] [Music]
[0:53] &gt;&gt; It's all because of him. Because he
[0:57] lives
[1:01] [Music]
[1:04] if he's gone because I
[1:11] call the future
[1:16] and life is worth living
[1:21] because

[7:50] glory

[7:55] Won't you come to this fountain so rich
[7:59] and sweet?
[8:02] Cast thior
[8:06] [Music]
[8:10] and be complete.

[9:28] Hallelujah. Just before we go to prayer,
[9:30] I want to sing 701.
[9:34] He was wounded for our transgressions.
[9:38] He was bruised for our iniquities.
[9:40] Surely he bore all of our sorrows. and
[9:44] by his stripes.
[9:46] If you're in need of healing tonight, by
[9:48] his stripes, he can't come today. Bear
[9:51] any more stripes. You can't beat
[9:52] yourself enough. But if you can just
[9:55] believe on him this evening.
[10:00] &gt;&gt; He was wounded
[10:03] for us.
[10:09] He was bruised for our
[10:19] [Music]
[10:23] soul.
[10:27] And by
[10:29] his stripes we are
[10:35] for he was wounded
[10:38] for our transress.
[10:42] [Music]
[10:44] He was ru for I
[10:49] [Music]
[10:54] surely
[10:58] sorrow
[11:02] and by
[11:04] his stripes we are
[11:10] for he was
[11:13] for
[11:15] as precious.
[11:19] He was bruised for I
[11:29] surely
[11:33] sorrow.
[11:35] [Music]
[11:45] Keep your mind on me. Keep
[11:52] your mind.
[11:54] [Music]
[11:58] &gt;&gt; There's a great secret in this.
[12:02] on me
[12:09] and I
[12:11] will give
[12:14] to you perfect
[12:17] [Music]
[12:19] sweet
[12:21] [Music]
[12:30] Can we do that tonight? Oh,
[12:34] [Music]
[12:41] &gt;&gt; yes. Stay
[12:44] on me.
[12:47] [Music]
[12:51] And I
[12:53] give
[12:55] you perfect
[12:58] peace.
[13:00] Sweet
[13:02] release.
[13:04] If you'll just keep your mind
[13:09] on me.
[13:13] Hallelujah.
[13:15] Hallelujah. We want to go to prayer at
[13:17] this time. I have brother Tony, brother
[13:20] Tony Adam, if you'd come lead us in
[13:22] prayer. Just coming back from Brazil.
[13:29] Do want to pray over a prayer cloth
[13:32] that's laid here in faith believing
[13:35] someone asking that the church would
[13:37] pray. They believe if they receive this
[13:40] that the same prayers that have been
[13:42] answered in the past will be conveyed
[13:44] unto them and healing can be granted. We
[13:48] also want to remember an unspoken prayer
[13:50] request that our pastors made known to
[13:52] ourselves this evening. It would desire
[13:54] that the church would just lift it up
[13:56] before the Lord. We don't always have to
[13:58] know all the facts. All we have to do is
[14:01] reach out and touch the hem of his
[14:03] garment on the behalf of others for
[14:05] living for others.
[14:08] This is the desire of our hearts and
[14:10] that's what touches the father. So we'll
[14:12] just go to prayer at this time
[14:14] remembering these needs.
[14:21] Heavenly father,
[14:25] we truly want to have our minds kept on
[14:27] thee, on thy word. Your promises that
[14:31] are sure and amen. your word that'll
[14:34] never pass away, but oh God is the means
[14:36] by which we can have faith in you. And
[14:38] to know, Lord, that you hear our
[14:40] prayers. To know, Lord, that your ear is
[14:42] attuned to your bride this evening.
[14:45] Lord, that you are, oh God, here in our
[14:47] midst tonight to move among us and to
[14:50] Lord Jesus perform your word. And
[14:52] Father, as we would gather here this
[14:55] evening in your name and in your
[14:57] presence, Lord, there are needs that we
[14:59] bring before the altar tonight. There
[15:01] are needs, Lord, of those, Father, that
[15:04] are in sickness and body, Lord, that are
[15:07] suffering in different ways, Father. All
[15:10] of these needs of which are met in you,
[15:12] Father. And we pray, Lord, as we lay our
[15:14] hands on this prayer cloth, that you
[15:16] would, Father, just, Lord, go and do the
[15:19] supernatural work, Father. Oh Lord, that
[15:22] you would undertake, Lord, that just as
[15:24] it was in the days when Paul was
[15:27] ministering, Lord, and they took claws
[15:28] from his body, that Lord, the sicknesses
[15:31] were driven away because of the
[15:33] supernatural presence of an almighty God
[15:36] that was in the midst. And Lord, we
[15:37] believe you're here with us the same way
[15:39] tonight. Lord, there's other needs as
[15:42] well. As we are holding a need of Lord a
[15:45] brother we baptize in Lebanon as Lord
[15:48] Jesus on death door. We hold Abraham up
[15:50] before you Lord that thy will would be
[15:52] done for your glory and your honor Lord.
[15:55] Lord Jesus let your word go forth in a
[15:58] great way Lord as we hold this need up
[16:00] before you. And Lord this unspoken
[16:02] request as well that brother Ed has
[16:05] brought before the assembly. Lord even
[16:08] before it was spoken even before it was
[16:10] made known. Lord, you knew the
[16:12] situation. It's a situation that's under
[16:15] divine control. And we rest in that
[16:17] tonight. We are assured that our lives
[16:20] are ordered of you. That you brought us
[16:22] forth into this season of time, Lord
[16:24] Jesus, to perform your word in us and to
[16:27] Lord, live through us. And in every
[16:29] situation, Lord, may you be glorified
[16:32] and may you receive honor. And so,
[16:34] Father, we have great expectation, Lord,
[16:36] as we've brought these requests before
[16:38] you. as we would turn our hearts to the
[16:40] word tonight. That's why we're here,
[16:42] Lord. To feed our souls, to be
[16:44] strengthened on the inner man, Lord, to
[16:46] live godly in this wicked and perverse
[16:49] world that we're living. Lord, let your
[16:50] glory rest upon us tonight as we ask all
[16:53] these mercies in the name of our Lord
[16:55] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[16:59] Amen. God bless you. You may have your
[17:01] seats this evening.
[17:03] Once again, we want to say God bless you
[17:05] to each and everyone. Those visiting
[17:06] here with us this evening, those on the
[17:08] internet hookup. Just want to say God
[17:11] bless you to you as well. We do want to
[17:13] make mention of a choir practice
[17:15] immediately. It's a junior choir
[17:17] practice immediately following the
[17:19] service this evening in the chapel. And
[17:22] on Sunday morning at 9:45
[17:25] a.m., there will be a junior choir
[17:26] practice in the chapel. So, if you're in
[17:28] the junior choir practice, you've been
[17:30] notified. So, please be prompt and in
[17:32] attendance.
[17:34] Praise the Lord. Isn't it good to be
[17:36] here?
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Can almost just relax and breathe for a
[17:40] couple of seconds and realize that
[17:41] you're back in a supernatural place
[17:44] where supernatural things happen. Even
[17:47] though we may not be aware of it, a
[17:48] person's being spoken to, the word is
[17:51] coming and delivering somebody. Could be
[17:53] sitting right next to you. It could be
[17:54] you. So, we just want to be sensitive to
[17:56] the moving of the Holy Spirit and ask
[17:59] that the Lord would meet with us. Once
[18:01] again, we'll invite our pastor to come
[18:03] this evening,
[18:05] speak what the Lord has laid upon his
[18:07] heart. Let's turn the screen to 590.
[18:10] There's a great haven of rest.
[18:15] We'll start with the chorus.
[18:18] [Music]
[18:22] anchored my soul
[18:26] in the haven
[18:28] of rest.
[18:30] I s
[18:33] I see
[18:35] no more
[18:39] the
[18:42] place we
[18:46] sto
[18:48] in Jesus
[18:51] I'm safe
[18:53] ever
[18:54] for I've anchored
[18:57] I've anchored
[18:59] My soul is in the haven
[19:04] of rest.
[19:06] I'll say who I see
[19:10] no more.
[19:15] The tempest
[19:17] made sweet
[19:19] or wild.
[19:23] [Music]
[19:32] &gt;&gt; Can we sing Ellie? Elohim. Ela. Elohim.
[19:37] Why don't we stand together? The song is
[19:41] I can't escape it. I thought I'd sing
[19:43] something else, but the Lord said no. We
[19:44] need to sing this before this service.
[19:46] So, we'll just sing it as a praise
[19:49] offering to the Lord. Amen.
[19:58] Lord,
[20:02] how we long
[20:04] to worship
[20:06] you.
[20:09] [Music]
[20:14] Oh,
[20:17] how we long
[20:20] to worship
[20:22] you.
[20:25] Lord, we come
[20:27] to you
[20:30] in worship.
[20:33] No matter what
[20:35] the circumstance,
[20:40] no matter what
[20:43] our situation,
[20:48] we will live
[20:51] a holy
[20:57] [Music]
[20:59] [Applause]
[21:04] How we long to worship
[21:08] you
[21:10] [Music]
[21:15] [Applause]
[21:16] [Music]
[21:21] to worship. worship you
[21:26] oh Lord we come to you
[21:30] in worship
[21:33] no matter what
[21:36] the
[21:38] Lord he's a wonderful God
[21:42] [Music]
[21:49] we will lift
[21:52] He has
[21:56] to
[21:58] [Music]
[22:06] worship
[22:08] you tonight
[22:12] [Applause]
[22:12] [Music]
[22:13] [Applause]
[22:15] and
[22:19] how we
[22:21] to worship
[22:23] you.
[22:25] Oh,
[22:30] and
[22:34] I long to worship
[22:38] you.
[22:43] [Music]
[22:51] to worship
[22:53] you.
[22:57] Amen. While you're standing yet, I would
[23:00] like to just sing a verse in a chorus of
[23:03] pass me not, oh gentle savior.
[23:06] Hear my humble cry while on others thou
[23:08] art calling. Let this be our prayer
[23:11] tonight. Do not pass me by.
[23:15] Count yourself in.
[23:18] Count yourself in for a a blessing
[23:21] tonight. Count yourself in for the
[23:24] answer
[23:25] &gt;&gt; to whatever need you might have. Count
[23:27] yourself in. Come expecting now.
[23:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[23:34] Maybe you keep Brother Derek's mic on
[23:36] too.
[23:38] Pass
[23:40] me,
[23:42] oh gentle Savior
[23:50] my
[23:53] cry
[23:55] [Music]
[23:58] and
[24:00] [Music]
[24:08] do
[24:09] not pass
[24:13] This is our
[24:18] [Music]
[24:28] humble
[24:31] cry.
[24:32] [Music]
[24:35] And
[24:37] [Music]
[24:41] Holy
[24:45] do.
[24:53] This is our prayer. Lord,
[24:56] Savior, Savior,
[24:58] hear my humble cry.
[25:01] While on others thou art calling, do not
[25:05] pass me by. Lord, there's many people
[25:08] here gathered this evening. And the
[25:11] prayer of every heart, I believe, is
[25:13] exactly the same.
[25:15] Come by here, Lord. Come by me. Come my
[25:20] way. Speak to me. I need to hear your
[25:23] voice. Oh Lord, I want to hear an
[25:26] answer.
[25:27] I pray, Father, that you will do so
[25:30] directly by the Holy Spirit or directly
[25:34] through your word, through the anointed
[25:36] preaching. Let it be anointed this
[25:39] evening, oh God. We're solely depending
[25:42] upon you. The arm of flesh will surely
[25:45] fail us, so we have no confidence in the
[25:48] flesh. We're trusting solely upon the
[25:52] ministry of the Holy Spirit. Let the
[25:54] breath of God brood over the people I
[25:57] pray. May every evil force be defeated
[26:00] right at the beginning of the service.
[26:02] Oh God, we feel a wonderful, glorious
[26:05] atmosphere. And now I pray that your
[26:07] name will be lifted up and glorified in
[26:10] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[26:14] May his name be praised.
[26:18] We're going to be turning to Exodus the
[26:21] 12th chapter. And while you're turning,
[26:23] we had some more good news today. And
[26:26] that is brother Zephaniah Peters from
[26:27] Tanzania got his visa. So we're thankful
[26:31] for that. It just wouldn't be just
[26:33] wouldn't be right if Brother Zephaniah
[26:35] wasn't here. Amen. He says he calls us
[26:38] his second home.
[26:42] So we're happy he feels that way. Amen.
[26:46] Exodus the 12th chapter, we're going to
[26:48] read two verses.
[26:54] that is 12 and 13.
[26:58] For I will pass through the land of
[27:00] Egypt this night and will smite all the
[27:02] firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man
[27:05] and beast, and against all the gods of
[27:09] Egypt. I will execute judgment. I am the
[27:12] Lord, and the blood shall be to you for
[27:16] a token upon the house where you are.
[27:19] When I see the blood, I will pass over
[27:22] you, and the plague shall not be upon
[27:25] you to destroy you when I smite the land
[27:29] of Egypt."
[27:30] God bless his word to us this evening.
[27:33] You may be seated.
[27:41] On Sunday,
[27:43] last Sunday,
[27:45] uh I spoke about entering into the Holy
[27:48] of Holies and entering into his rest.
[27:52] And God spoke about my rest.
[27:55] But I just want to uh I I want to give
[27:58] some special attention just to for the
[28:00] moment to the phrase that Apostle Paul
[28:05] said, "Seeing therefore it remainth that
[28:07] some must enter in." And I would like to
[28:11] draw your attention to the fact that
[28:13] entering is an action word.
[28:16] And this evening I want to speak on
[28:19] applying the token and that applying is
[28:23] a is an action word and preparing you
[28:27] for Sunday. Lord willing on Sunday I
[28:30] would like to minister
[28:33] on desperation
[28:35] which is also an action word. If you're
[28:38] in desperation you will do something.
[28:40] And yet they're all tied together. These
[28:43] uh these subjects are all tied together.
[28:46] And so these these verbs of entering
[28:50] into his rest, applying the token
[28:54] and striving to enter in at the straight
[28:57] gate, seeking him with all your heart in
[29:02] that hour of desperation and they're all
[29:05] tied together. Brother Brandham preached
[29:07] the token message and the very next
[29:11] service was the desperation
[29:14] because the verses which we have just
[29:16] read I will pass through the land of
[29:19] Egypt
[29:20] this night. So was bringing it right
[29:23] down to that moment.
[29:26] And I'll smite all the firstborn
[29:30] in the land of Egypt, both man and
[29:32] beast. And against all the gods of
[29:35] Egypt, I will execute judgment. I am the
[29:38] Lord.
[29:39] And the blood shall be to you for you
[29:43] for a token upon the houses.
[29:46] We had the young people had and know
[29:50] most of you that are here this evening
[29:51] will well remember the camp the
[29:54] presentation
[29:56] where there was one door of the Hebrews
[30:00] and they were not really
[30:04] uh uh they weren't very fervent about
[30:07] what Moses the prophet had spoken and
[30:10] they had the father had a position and
[30:13] working for the Egyptians he was kind of
[30:15] between the leaders uh uh the task
[30:19] masters and the people and so he had a
[30:22] good position. Things were quite easy
[30:24] for him. So he just couldn't take it as
[30:26] seriously as the next household which
[30:30] took it very seriously and and the son
[30:33] is asking father have we covered you
[30:35] know have we have we applied the have we
[30:38] applied the blood to the doorpost and
[30:40] the and the door lentil and he was so uh
[30:44] concerned about it and he said well
[30:45] we're doing everything that the prophet
[30:47] of God has said we're doing everything
[30:48] that he said we're doing it just the way
[30:50] that he said it and in that they rested
[30:52] and death struck the other family even
[30:54] though they were Hebrews and it was a
[30:57] very very striking and very serious very
[31:01] solemn time but it was just an enactment
[31:05] but it was no less real. I can tell you
[31:08] that even though we read these two
[31:09] verses these two verses happened to
[31:12] involve
[31:14] hundreds of thousands of people and
[31:17] homes and brought a whole nation to
[31:20] their knees.
[31:22] And uh
[31:24] it was just a simple act of applying the
[31:27] blood, but it was an act and it had to
[31:29] be done.
[31:31] And I have uh been you know I ponder a
[31:34] lot of things from week to week and as
[31:37] the months go by and the years go by and
[31:40] I I see the effect of the message on uh
[31:44] the lives of people and then I I see
[31:47] others that do not take it really
[31:50] seriously.
[31:51] And there are things that are ministered
[31:54] things that the prophet of God has said
[31:58] very clearly. You don't even need a
[32:00] revelation. It just says it very
[32:03] clearly, very plain. And then you'll
[32:06] you'll see, you know, and I think we're
[32:07] all inclined that way sometime. Just
[32:10] kind of carry on. Well, yeah, I know.
[32:11] And I should change and I should do it
[32:13] and I should correct it and and so on.
[32:16] And I I would say that the hour is too
[32:19] late for us to take it casually. The
[32:23] hour is far too late. And I think that
[32:26] we we must be more than hearers of the
[32:29] word. We need to be doers.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Action is what God wants.
[32:36] And so in the message in the desperation
[32:40] message and you might want to read that
[32:43] between now and Sunday uh or hear it uh
[32:47] I will be I expect to be Lord willing in
[32:50] that message quite a uh to quite
[32:52] extensively on Sunday. But in the
[32:55] desperation message, brother Brown's
[32:57] referring back to the token message
[32:59] which he just preached the service
[33:01] before and he said the message this
[33:04] morning was to me that was the token
[33:07] message was to me the highlights message
[33:11] of my entire ministry. You know this is
[33:14] 1963 September 1963.
[33:17] It's getting on. He's only got 64 and 65
[33:20] to minister. So it's right towards the
[33:22] end of his ministry. So he said it's the
[33:24] highlight message of my entire ministry
[33:27] this morning. Highlight message of my
[33:30] entire ministry. He says it twice. And
[33:33] he says further. Now there's many people
[33:37] who don't know what that token is. And I
[33:41] think there's perhaps many here that
[33:44] don't fully uh know. They know that well
[33:46] it was the blood back then. But we're
[33:48] we're not we're not 3 and 4 thousand
[33:50] years ago. we're up here today and what
[33:53] is the token now? And brother Brandham
[33:56] of course tells us the token is the the
[33:58] Holy Spirit is the token today. But you
[34:01] know that's just a phrase to a lot of
[34:02] people and we want to we want to make it
[34:07] uh more clear. Uh I want you to
[34:10] understand it. We I think that we uh we
[34:14] need to be able to uh spend some quiet
[34:17] time on this Wednesday evening. And I'm
[34:20] just going to keep back from preaching
[34:22] as as such. But I would like to lay some
[34:25] things in. Um while everyone doesn't
[34:29] know maybe what as brother Bram said
[34:31] doesn't know what the token is
[34:34] talking about today. We must have the
[34:37] token. That is absolutely essential. But
[34:40] yet we preach it anyway. While not
[34:44] everyone everyone here may not even have
[34:46] it applied. I trust it will be applied.
[34:49] But I'm going to be dwelling on that
[34:51] word, applying the token very, very
[34:54] much. And even though, you know, we
[34:56] preach the gospel, we know that
[34:58] everybody's not going to be saved, but
[34:59] yet we preach the gospel because it's
[35:01] for some. Uh we know that everyone's not
[35:04] going to be healed, but we preach
[35:05] healing anyway. We preach faith even
[35:08] though maybe everybody hasn't got faith,
[35:09] but we preach it because faith come by
[35:11] hearing and hearing by the word of God.
[35:13] So we preach it anyway. We preach
[35:15] salvation anyway. We preach the token
[35:17] anyway.
[35:18] Amen.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Because uh somebody's going to take a
[35:21] hold of it.
[35:25] Now, the the time of the token most
[35:29] certainly points to the sacrifice, and
[35:31] we understand that the time of the token
[35:35] certainly points to the sacrifice of
[35:37] Jesus Christ at Calvary, but also of
[35:40] this time. And I think for us more
[35:43] importantly at this time, not more
[35:46] important than Calvary. Calvary was the
[35:48] purchase price paid. But now it is the
[35:51] redemption. The redemption that was paid
[35:55] for this the claiming time. It is
[35:58] redemption claiming time. But in in Luke
[36:01] 17:30, which is the revealing of the son
[36:04] of man, it was a it was an evening time
[36:08] back then for the Jewish nation. And
[36:11] after that they went into darkness and
[36:12] have been for 2,000 years. It's the
[36:15] evening time for the Gentiles at this
[36:17] time. And in the message, the token
[36:20] message while I lay this foundation,
[36:23] prophet said the lamb was killed in the
[36:27] evening time after being kept up for 14
[36:31] days. And then the lamb was killed and
[36:34] the blood was applied. I'd like you just
[36:37] to watch this word as we go through
[36:39] applied because I believe perhaps you'll
[36:42] see it from quite a different direction
[36:44] tonight and it'll be a blessing to you
[36:46] and a lot of good solid instruction and
[36:48] we can go away and and actually uh put
[36:51] it into apply it to our lives. The blood
[36:55] was applied in the evening time and he
[36:58] said you get it. The token never came
[37:00] into existence until the evening time.
[37:04] And this is the evening time. And we
[37:06] know that this is the evening time of
[37:09] the age that we live in. This is the
[37:11] evening time of the church. This is the
[37:15] evening time. He said, for me, this is
[37:18] the evening time of my message. He said,
[37:21] I'm dying. I'm going. I'm moving out in
[37:24] the evening time of the gospel.
[37:28] So the token which was the Passover
[37:33] was a critical moment for these people.
[37:36] And if it was if that was a critical
[37:39] moment for those people, is it any less
[37:43] critical for us? I say not
[37:47] &gt;&gt; and perhaps much more so critical for us
[37:50] than it was for them. So, we're not just
[37:52] sitting here on a Wednesday evening, you
[37:56] know, uh, well, we've come to church,
[37:59] and I want to move way beyond just
[38:01] coming to church on a Wednesday evening
[38:04] or on any any service. We want to move
[38:07] far beyond that because we are living in
[38:11] a real crisis time. When we look around,
[38:16] you don't have to look very far and you
[38:18] can see that there's distress of
[38:20] nations. There's violence everywhere and
[38:24] men's hearts are failing for fear. And
[38:27] that's not a negative thing because we
[38:29] have the most positive gospel that there
[38:31] is. This is a crisis time that we're
[38:35] living in. And God has provided
[38:38] abundantly for every believer that can
[38:41] live victoriously in this time.
[38:46] The Passover night,
[38:48] the Passover night which we just read
[38:50] read about was the culmination
[38:54] of all the plagues and a mighty
[38:57] ministry. Now the people had not
[39:00] participated in it themselves. They saw
[39:02] the hand of God in mighty demonstration,
[39:07] God uh without any question and beyond
[39:11] any doubt, any doubt whatsoever, God
[39:14] himself demonstrated himself, manifested
[39:18] himself so that all the people,
[39:20] believers, unbelievers, makeelievers,
[39:22] all had to know that was God that was
[39:25] moving on us and brought the plagues.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; It had really nothing to do with the
[39:30] people. And we're sitting here today. We
[39:33] are the product of a message that we
[39:36] really had nothing to do with in it
[39:38] coming. And it came with an incredible
[39:42] demonstration of power.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; We had nothing to do with that power. We
[39:48] had nothing to do with what took place.
[39:50] But it came with an incredible
[39:52] demonstration even to the raising of the
[39:55] dead. several cases of being of the dead
[39:59] being raised and the supernatural and
[40:01] and all kinds of supernatural things.
[40:04] And so God in so doing will you say well
[40:08] back then he brought a nation to their
[40:10] knees as it were. He I would say that he
[40:13] God has in this time actually brought
[40:16] the world to a time of decision.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Either accept it or reject it. And you
[40:23] might say, well, there's multitudes
[40:25] never never heard. Well, there was all
[40:26] kinds of multitudes never heard Moses'
[40:28] voice either. But nevertheless, God
[40:31] accounted it to the whole nation. And
[40:34] this time it is really to the whole
[40:36] world. And so, not since the days of the
[40:38] apostles, I want to just make a few
[40:41] quotes.
[40:43] Not since
[40:46] in the in the message, Jesus Christ the
[40:48] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[40:50] Brother Brandham is saying nowhere you
[40:53] find in find it in history since the
[40:56] days of the apostles.
[40:58] This is the last winding up of the
[41:01] message to the Gentiles.
[41:04] And FF Bosworth
[41:08] uh he made a he made a remarkable
[41:11] statement. FF Bossworth, if you have the
[41:14] Isuza Street uh book, Isuza uh the Isuza
[41:19] revival that broke out, the Pentecost
[41:21] revival, and many of the early I got a a
[41:25] book that was sent me just recently, 100
[41:27] years of Pentecost. And uh FF Bosworth's
[41:31] pictures there, he's one of the original
[41:33] fathers of that great movement at that
[41:37] time. And brother Brandham asked, "How
[41:39] many knows Fred Bosworth?" And do you
[41:42] believe him to be a good man? He is. And
[41:44] he's as close to me as my daddy. But yet
[41:48] in that, brother Bosworth, who stood by
[41:51] my side, who stood in the pulpit, who's
[41:53] preached of this gift, who's built
[41:56] platform, who's constantly speaks of it.
[41:59] He constantly speaks of of the ministry.
[42:03] And he and this is what Father Bosworth
[42:05] said. He said, "I'm 70some years old.
[42:08] I've never seen it. Never read of
[42:11] anything like it since the days of the
[42:14] apostles. Never seen anything like it.
[42:17] Never read anything like it since the
[42:19] days of the apostles. And here's a man
[42:22] and people look back to Isuza Street and
[42:24] the great mighty revival and everything
[42:26] else. Here's a man that was a one of the
[42:28] fathers
[42:30] of that great move and he says, "I've
[42:32] never seen anything since the days of
[42:34] the apostles." So, he's he's attributing
[42:37] uh a supernatural that that was taking
[42:40] place in the in Brother Brandham's
[42:42] ministry that he never saw back then,
[42:44] even in 1906. And they said it was just
[42:47] swept the whole world. But he said,
[42:48] "I've never seen anything. I've never
[42:50] heard anything. I've never read anything
[42:52] like this since the days of the apostles
[42:56] in the message of grace."
[42:59] said, "God has done great signs and
[43:01] wonders like he's never done since the
[43:03] world, since the days of the Lord Jesus.
[43:07] He's never did it in all the history of
[43:09] time and around the world that's went
[43:12] and still the world continually getting
[43:14] worse." But then I have to remember that
[43:17] we're living in the Leodysian church age
[43:20] where there where they will get worse
[43:23] and it said that they would for the
[43:25] scripture says it'll wax worse and
[43:27] worse. So even though the greater move
[43:31] and a greater revival and nothing like
[43:33] it since the time of the apostles and
[43:36] just one last quote along this line uh
[43:39] because this is bringing us into into
[43:42] focus. You've been called under that
[43:44] kind of a message that called under that
[43:48] kind of a demonstration.
[43:51] Maybe you didn't see it. We didn't see
[43:54] Moses and we didn't see the plagues. Any
[43:56] one of them but we believe it happened.
[43:58] Exactly the way the scripture says
[44:02] in the message Balman Gilead. Now when
[44:05] we he said when we seen the greatest
[44:07] thing the greatest revival the greatest
[44:09] ministries that's ever been known since
[44:12] the days of Jesus Christ has crossed
[44:15] this nation. Tell me when,
[44:19] where, where whereabouts did you ever
[44:22] read in a book or hear or even know of
[44:26] ministry like we have today? Now, he
[44:29] said, now what's going to follow it?
[44:32] Judgment to reject it. So, people say,
[44:36] well, uh, you know,
[44:39] I don't see any judgment. Quite frankly,
[44:41] I see it everywhere.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; I see judgment everywhere. I see it on
[44:46] the people. Uh whenever you see what's
[44:48] happening with our youth and happening
[44:51] and the and the wickedness and the vile
[44:54] things that are taking place to me, it's
[44:56] judgment.
[44:58] It's judgment. The bars and and then
[45:01] here's another thing. I don't know if
[45:02] you've ever thought of this. Probably
[45:03] you have.
[45:05] But you know, when you just consider
[45:07] some of these things when you when you
[45:10] speak of and when I rehearse in your
[45:13] ears the mighty things and the
[45:16] supernatural and you talk about the tent
[45:18] meetings, you talk about the revival,
[45:21] you talk about them packing out
[45:23] auditoriums across the entire nation and
[45:27] not only thousands, tens of thousands,
[45:30] not only tens of thousands, hundreds of
[45:32] thousands of people gathering ing and
[45:35] you see what is what has taken place and
[45:37] then look at the nation today you know
[45:40] look at America today look at Canada
[45:42] today cold formal dead as dead twice
[45:45] dead plucked up by the roots say what
[45:48] was the effect of all of that you know
[45:50] what it was is a whole lot of emotion a
[45:53] whole lot of physical things people
[45:55] desiring healing and desiring miracles
[45:57] where the miracles take them nowhere
[46:01] &gt;&gt; you can have miracles every day of your
[46:03] life but once You get birthed by the
[46:06] word of God.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; It'll be a change in your life. And that
[46:10] change will last all of your days and
[46:13] take you on into eternity. It has to be
[46:15] a word birth. It's not just a, you know,
[46:18] miracle miracle and having all these
[46:20] kind of things. They're lovely. They're
[46:22] wonderful. What did the plagues do for
[46:25] for Egypt? Nothing.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; They went on their own way
[46:29] and never recovered.
[46:32] go to Egypt today if you think they've
[46:34] recovered.
[46:37] I'm not a travel agent, but
[46:42] so the evening time message has forced a
[46:45] time of decision upon this generation.
[46:49] Now, it's a it's a paradox. The paradox
[46:52] is this. I'm not just telling you, but
[46:55] you know deep in your heart that this
[46:58] message is unlike any message. There is
[47:00] nothing like it.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; We can say also similarly that the Lord
[47:05] Jesus Christ as a man because he was the
[47:09] word in flesh and there was there was no
[47:12] one there wasn't others that were
[47:14] similar to him.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; He was like he lived on another planet.
[47:19] He was in another league. He was in
[47:21] another realm. And as the prophet said,
[47:23] he dwelt in two worlds at the same time.
[47:26] That was our Lord Jesus Christ. And if
[47:29] and and if this message in word form is
[47:32] revealing him, if it is the revelation
[47:35] of him, then there can be no message
[47:38] even remotely similar to it.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; It has to be as different as he was
[47:43] different.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; He was all alone. He was completely
[47:47] isolated to the to the rest of the
[47:50] world. And this message is entirely
[47:52] different. It will never become
[47:54] familiar.
[47:57] And so we don't want to ourselves who
[48:00] feed on it day by day. We don't want to
[48:03] let it become familiar.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; We don't want that. We don't want it
[48:07] just to we don't want to be at ease in
[48:09] Zion. We don't want to, you know, and
[48:12] and uh brother Brandham brought it up a
[48:14] number of times. It speaks of it also in
[48:16] the scripture. You know, when we we get
[48:19] our jobs and we get our homes and we get
[48:22] kind of things put together,
[48:24] those time those blessings never tend
[48:28] towards making a person more fervent and
[48:31] more zealous. They always tend to make a
[48:35] person, you know, kind of settle back
[48:37] because things are taken care of and the
[48:39] bills are being paid and I've got my job
[48:42] and we've got our home and we've got our
[48:44] car and we've kind of got our our
[48:47] holiday vacation all slotted and what
[48:50] we're doing and you know we're doing
[48:52] this and you young people, bunch of you
[48:55] gone through your graduation uh
[48:58] ceremonies and all these things and you
[49:00] know things are kind of mapped out and
[49:02] We we there's a tendency when we come
[49:04] into the house of God. Well, we're in
[49:06] the house of God. This is church. Yeah.
[49:08] Here's our ministers. There's a pastor.
[49:10] And uh and we've we've got things more
[49:13] or less uh all put in place. And there's
[49:17] a tendency then to just kind of lax off.
[49:20] But I think if this is as critical a
[49:23] time as as the token message says it is
[49:27] and as the desperation message says it
[49:29] is, then we ought to be we ought to be
[49:32] and I shouldn't even have to say it, but
[49:34] we ought to feel an urgency. We ought to
[49:37] feel an urgency all the time because
[49:41] it's a critical time. And it's not
[49:44] critical because our environment
[49:46] necessarily says it's critical. It's
[49:48] critical because the word of God says
[49:51] it's critical.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; You might be able to look at some things
[49:56] in a relative way and say, "Well, things
[49:58] are actually better today. There are
[50:01] things are actually going better." You
[50:02] know, and if you look at some things,
[50:05] you might be able to say that. But a
[50:07] real believer can't say that. I wouldn't
[50:09] say that because it's not because we see
[50:12] things from a different perspective.
[50:13] Well, let me go on quickly. the our L
[50:16] the Lord Jesus said the law and the
[50:19] prophets where until John and since that
[50:23] time the kingdom of God is preached and
[50:26] every man every man pressth into it
[50:30] that's not just men but men and women
[50:33] both every person in other words
[50:36] presseth into it it's an active action
[50:41] word we're not there's nothing in the
[50:44] Bible that really indicates that we just
[50:46] kind of uh you know can relax ourselves.
[50:49] It they press into it and the Bible says
[50:53] that every man presseth into it and the
[50:56] word is that they use force they apply
[50:59] force there there we should as believers
[51:03] feel a force within us driving us
[51:07] forward.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:11] applying
[51:13] uh uh uh the pressing into it and
[51:17] applying a force. There is a force there
[51:19] should be a force within us. Now
[51:23] applying the token is uh
[51:29] it's an action word
[51:32] and the action in this case is doing not
[51:36] just hearing.
[51:38] And uh I I'm going to come down to where
[51:41] we live. I'm going to come down to our
[51:43] address. Your address, my address.
[51:47] I've stood behind this pullpit
[51:50] and have preached
[51:52] and I've seen the word go out. I've seen
[51:56] lives touched and I know that God has
[51:59] spoken. in fact is just a couple of
[52:02] meetings ago,
[52:06] I know that there was an individual
[52:08] standing here at the end of the service
[52:11] that could was so moved
[52:15] and I was waiting to see the surrender
[52:20] and I knew that God was speaking to this
[52:23] individual. I knew it. I knew it as well
[52:26] as I knew my own name. But and I know
[52:30] that that individual knew that they
[52:33] should be surrendering and God was
[52:36] dealing with them and dealing with them
[52:38] and dealing with them, but they didn't
[52:40] move. I only use that as an example
[52:44] because I believe that there's as the
[52:46] weeks and months go by and the years
[52:48] roll by, it's amazing how long we can
[52:51] hang on to something
[52:54] &gt;&gt; that we know
[52:56] &gt;&gt; we ought to surrender up.
[52:58] we know we ought to let go. It's amazing
[53:02] how long we will allow things that we
[53:05] know are wrong or attitudes that we know
[53:09] are wrong and we'll hang on to those
[53:12] attitudes and we'll hang on to that that
[53:16] thing and and not let go of it. It's
[53:19] it's amazing to me and I I think that if
[53:23] we as individuals could just uh
[53:26] assimilate what I'm saying this evening.
[53:28] It's a critical time. We don't have time
[53:32] to wait. We don't have time to let
[53:34] things go on and on and on and on. What
[53:36] we ought to do, we ought to respond very
[53:39] quickly. And I'm preaching also to
[53:41] myself. We ought to respond very, very
[53:43] quickly and say, "God, you speak and
[53:47] I'll do it." Because the scripture is
[53:50] very clear
[53:54] about doing the word. Be ye not hearers
[53:58] only but doers of the word. And the
[54:02] scripture tells us of the man that built
[54:04] it his house on the sand and the other
[54:07] man who built it on the rock dug deep
[54:10] and built it on the rock. And one simply
[54:13] the only difference between the two one
[54:15] was a hearer and the other one was a
[54:18] doer. Jesus is telling us a powerful
[54:21] powerful truth. It's not sufficient to
[54:24] sit in a comfortable church and hear it
[54:28] only.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; And you might as well say amen even if
[54:32] it hurts. Just say ouch.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; But say amen anyway.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; I say amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; I say amen. Not because it's a wonderful
[54:42] preaching, but because it's truth.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; And I would like to see I would like to
[54:48] believe that we could have a
[54:50] congregation of people that would be so
[54:53] sensitive to the Holy Spirit that as
[54:56] soon as the Holy Spirit just spoke to
[54:59] our individual heart, we had an
[55:02] immediate yes Lord. Yes, I will do it.
[55:07] Yes, I will go. And it will change the
[55:11] whole atmosphere of the of the
[55:14] congregation and quite frankly change
[55:17] the whole atmosphere of the meetings.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; The meetings would be different
[55:22] completely different if we had say the
[55:26] the whole majority of the congregation
[55:29] just moving under the brooding of the
[55:31] Holy Spirit. Yes. And we surrender. Yes.
[55:35] Lord, you've identified that thing and I
[55:38] leave it. I leave it right now. I'm on
[55:41] my way. I'm leaving that behind. Can you
[55:44] say
[55:44] &gt;&gt; amen?
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; In the message desperation. Now, I've
[55:55] got a number of quotes and I'm going to
[55:57] uh I'm going to spend a little time on
[55:59] them.
[56:01] He said, "Now I'm sure or hope that you
[56:05] got what the token meant. The token is
[56:08] the sign
[56:10] that the blood has been applied.
[56:14] So the blood had to be applied.
[56:17] Um uh the the man of the house had a
[56:20] responsibility
[56:23] for his household and he had to apply
[56:26] the blood.
[56:28] It was a sign that the price had been
[56:31] the price that had that's been asked
[56:33] required of God. It had been paid and it
[56:38] was a sign that God received you.
[56:43] Now appi applying the token
[56:46] and this is where I want to come to for
[56:48] this evening. Applying the token is
[56:51] actually living an example life.
[56:56] A life that's lived out as an example.
[57:01] And if we hear the word
[57:04] and it speaks to us but we don't do it
[57:07] then there is no example.
[57:10] Amen.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; If we hear the word
[57:14] and God speaks to us concerning
[57:17] something that may be very very
[57:18] personal, something within your own
[57:21] life, your own realm, but if we don't do
[57:24] it,
[57:26] then we are not applying
[57:29] the token because the token is an action
[57:33] word. Token is the life being lived out.
[57:38] That's exactly what it is.
[57:40] God gave God gave the word and it come
[57:43] out of Moses' mouth. This is exactly
[57:45] what you're supposed to do. You take the
[57:47] Passover lamb and and and here's how you
[57:50] order every step of it. So when they
[57:52] took that lamb and when they slay slew
[57:56] the lamb and took the blood and and and
[57:59] uh did all the other things that were
[58:02] essential for the Passover because
[58:04] brother Brandham also called that the
[58:06] communion. So they had communion.
[58:10] So they slay the lamb and it's prepared
[58:13] a certain way and they eat it and they
[58:16] have like brother Brandham said you know
[58:20] the children perhaps the son said
[58:23] hey father why you got the staff in your
[58:26] hand? Why have you got the shoes? Why
[58:29] have you got the sandals on your feet?
[58:31] Because this was not an ordinary meal.
[58:34] Right?
[58:35] &gt;&gt; You eat it with haste
[58:37] &gt;&gt; and you eat it this way and you be pre
[58:39] be prepared to move out. It's a critical
[58:42] time.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; If that was so then what about now? I'd
[58:47] say we want to have the shoes on our
[58:48] feet. We want to have the staff of the
[58:51] word in our hand. We want to be ready to
[58:53] move out.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a critical time.
[58:58] Judgment falling everywhere. We've
[59:00] received a message. We received a an
[59:03] invitation.
[59:07] Time to move out.
[59:09] It was a critical time.
[59:12] So applying the token now.
[59:16] Brother Brandham says this, you are a
[59:20] creator yourself,
[59:22] a miniature creator.
[59:25] And did you ever see people that were
[59:27] nice people though you just couldn't
[59:31] be around them hardly?
[59:35] Something about something about them you
[59:38] just couldn't stand. This is exactly
[59:40] what he said.
[59:42] Did you ever see people that you just
[59:44] love to be around? Did you ever see them
[59:47] kind of people
[59:49] that's the atmosphere that they create
[59:52] themselves?
[59:54] someone creates an atmosphere and you
[59:57] love to be around it. And others, he
[1:00:00] said, they're nice people. They're good
[1:00:02] people. They're real godly people.
[1:00:04] They're Christians and all the rest of
[1:00:05] it, but they the atmosphere that they
[1:00:08] create around them or that is created
[1:00:11] around them for whatever reason. It's
[1:00:13] maybe it's just not an atmosphere that
[1:00:16] you like to be around. It's not
[1:00:18] something that you kind of, you know,
[1:00:20] want to be associated with. not bad
[1:00:23] people, but it's it doesn't minister
[1:00:25] anything to you. And then you have
[1:00:27] others you just like to be around them.
[1:00:29] And when you leave, you feel
[1:00:31] strengthened. You feel edified. You feel
[1:00:34] higher. You feel better off.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Because each one of us create an
[1:00:42] atmosphere around us. I want you to hang
[1:00:45] on to that now. Hold on to that because
[1:00:47] that's going to me be important. And he
[1:00:49] said, "And let me tell you today, my
[1:00:51] dear friends, the greatest thing that
[1:00:55] there is this side of heaven is lovable
[1:01:04] statements and accounts that brother
[1:01:06] Brandham has given and used the
[1:01:10] principle of love and I have been deeply
[1:01:14] deeply I won't say affected, but I've
[1:01:17] been deeply convicted
[1:01:19] because I have I've read it.
[1:01:23] I listened to it and I just in no wise
[1:01:26] feel that I can anyway measure up to
[1:01:30] what he said love would be.
[1:01:35] You say, "Is that true?" Yeah. And I
[1:01:37] think if I threw it out here this
[1:01:39] evening, and I won't do it, but I think
[1:01:41] there'd be most of this people that sit
[1:01:44] sitting here in this church that would
[1:01:46] confess.
[1:01:48] I don't have that measure. I haven't
[1:01:51] experienced that kind of love.
[1:01:58] Maybe you couldn't even experience this.
[1:01:59] Listen,
[1:02:03] divine love. He said, "God is love." You
[1:02:07] read in the book, now he's talking about
[1:02:09] his own experiences, one that took place
[1:02:11] in Portland, Oregon. You read in the
[1:02:13] book when a maniac ran out to kill me on
[1:02:17] the platform that night. I was with
[1:02:19] brother Brandham and he related this
[1:02:21] exact this very happening.
[1:02:24] Brother Edwin Dods brought a man here
[1:02:27] that was a uh an executive of the
[1:02:32] UPC, United Pentecost organization, and
[1:02:35] I believe he was head of home missions
[1:02:37] or something. He was in this meeting.
[1:02:41] You remember that, brother Dodd? And
[1:02:43] said, "My pastor," Brother Dodd was
[1:02:45] telling this man, "My pastor knew
[1:02:48] Brother Brandham and was in the meetings
[1:02:50] and saw some supernatural things. Maybe
[1:02:52] you'd like to meet him." So, we arranged
[1:02:54] and met in my study right here after the
[1:02:57] service. And this man was in this
[1:03:00] meeting and saw this happen and saw that
[1:03:04] maniac come up and and brother Brandham
[1:03:07] told me that when that maniac stood in
[1:03:09] front of him and was frothing at the
[1:03:11] mouth, he was saying to him through his
[1:03:14] clenched teeth, I'm going to tear you
[1:03:16] limb from limb.
[1:03:19] Now, here's what brother Brandham says.
[1:03:22] He came up to kill me that night. He
[1:03:24] said, I didn't hate the man.
[1:03:27] I loved him.
[1:03:31] Now put yourself honestly put yourself
[1:03:35] in his shoes
[1:03:37] and have somebody tear in here and come
[1:03:40] up in your face. I'm going to tear you
[1:03:44] limb from limb and you know maybe it's
[1:03:46] full of demon power
[1:03:49] and what are you going to do?
[1:03:52] This to me smites me in the deepest part
[1:03:55] of my heart because brother Benham said
[1:03:57] I didn't hate him.
[1:04:00] And you might say, "Well, I wouldn't
[1:04:01] hate him either." No, but your heart, no
[1:04:03] doubt, would be filled with fear.
[1:04:06] And you'd be looking for the exit doors,
[1:04:08] and I might be doing the same thing. You
[1:04:11] say, "Would you, Brother Ed? Yeah, I'm
[1:04:13] human. You think I want somebody to tear
[1:04:16] me limb from limb?" I might look at this
[1:04:18] big strapping fellow and say, "I'm I'm
[1:04:21] I'm history."
[1:04:23] Unless God had spoken something very,
[1:04:25] very specific to me and said, "Stand
[1:04:27] there and I'll be with you."
[1:04:31] He said, "I loved him. I felt sorry for
[1:04:34] him." And that's what slew him on the
[1:04:38] platform.
[1:04:40] He actually dropped on Brother
[1:04:41] Brandham's shoes.
[1:04:46] Now, I can't say that I experienced a
[1:04:48] great move of love, but I was in a
[1:04:50] meeting and there was a demon-possessed
[1:04:53] young man. He was very sturdy fellow. He
[1:04:57] wasn't he wasn't big, but he was
[1:05:00] violent, very violent.
[1:05:03] And they told me that this young man
[1:05:07] tears up meetings and he's very violent.
[1:05:10] And the people were fearful of him. And
[1:05:13] so before before I started to before I
[1:05:16] started the service, I just said, "I
[1:05:18] just want everybody to bow your heads.
[1:05:20] We're going to pray." And I and I told
[1:05:22] him clearly, I said, "We're going to
[1:05:24] bind that demon.
[1:05:26] That demon is not going to be able to
[1:05:28] disturb this service." And that young
[1:05:30] man had a red polka dot handkerchief
[1:05:34] in his hand. He took that red
[1:05:37] handkerchief out. And as long as I
[1:05:40] preached and as long as that service
[1:05:42] went on, he just twisted that thing in
[1:05:44] his hand and he couldn't do a thing. He
[1:05:48] was as he was as controlled as a mouse
[1:05:52] under the power of God. And I can't say
[1:05:55] that I had a great expression of love,
[1:05:58] but I knew one thing that that God had
[1:06:01] put that service in my hands and the
[1:06:03] devil had no right to disturb it. And
[1:06:05] we're going to bind him right there. and
[1:06:07] he was absolutely bound through the
[1:06:09] whole service. And we prayed for the
[1:06:11] young man after the after the meeting
[1:06:13] and what happened after that. That was
[1:06:14] the last time I I I actually saw him.
[1:06:18] But he said, "Love is the mightiest
[1:06:20] force there is. And even felio love,
[1:06:24] felio love will make a mother jump
[1:06:27] through a fire to grab her burning baby.
[1:06:30] She won't think of herself." Even felio
[1:06:32] love. What about agela love?
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's it's it's within reach,
[1:06:38] friends.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; And you don't know you don't know what
[1:06:41] you have until you're called on.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; You are a creator, he said, of an
[1:06:49] atmosphere around you. And you make that
[1:06:52] yourself by your own disposition and the
[1:06:56] spirit that's on the inside of you. The
[1:06:58] spirit that's on the inside of you.
[1:07:00] You're creating an atmosphere. When you
[1:07:02] go out of this place tonight, I don't
[1:07:04] care whether it's at home or at your
[1:07:06] work or wherever it might be, if you if
[1:07:10] you focused your thoughts on this and
[1:07:12] believed it with all your heart, you
[1:07:15] say, "I am creating an atmosphere.
[1:07:20] I'm creating an atmosphere.
[1:07:29] the spirit that's on the inside of you.
[1:07:33] Now, I want to take the word apply
[1:07:36] because that atmosphere that you create,
[1:07:41] you're actually applying something.
[1:07:44] You know, if you get all distressed and
[1:07:47] nervous
[1:07:49] and uh
[1:07:55] we've even had people
[1:07:59] We've had people and there's a certain
[1:08:01] spirit that I have confronted a number
[1:08:04] of times and that spirit jumps on people
[1:08:07] and when you start feeling really
[1:08:09] miserable,
[1:08:11] it's amazing how that likes company. I'm
[1:08:15] miserable and I just want somebody else
[1:08:18] to feel miserable, too. And you create
[1:08:21] that kind of an atmosphere and do you
[1:08:23] know what happens? Somebody else starts
[1:08:25] feeling miserable.
[1:08:27] They didn't experience what you
[1:08:28] experienced. They had had nothing to do
[1:08:31] with what you went through, but you just
[1:08:33] feel miserable.
[1:08:35] And uh I'm just not content to be
[1:08:38] miserable by myself.
[1:08:41] We've actually dealt
[1:08:43] with people that have been in that state
[1:08:47] and they actually know. I've talked to
[1:08:50] them. I said, "Do you know it's a
[1:08:51] spirit?"
[1:08:53] Furthermore, do you know that it's an
[1:08:54] evil spirit? And and they'll agree.
[1:08:57] Yeah. Yeah. I said, 'Now, I can tell you
[1:09:00] because I've done a few battles with him
[1:09:02] and I can even tell you how that works.
[1:09:06] He builds up his case and maybe things
[1:09:09] start going wrong in the day or in the
[1:09:12] morning and things just aren't exactly
[1:09:14] right and you you we've got all kinds of
[1:09:16] words. We feel down in the mouth. We
[1:09:18] feel blue. We feel gloomy. We feel
[1:09:21] whatever more. None of those are in the
[1:09:22] Bible.
[1:09:24] But I said at some point in time, you
[1:09:27] actually start feeling just a dark
[1:09:28] cloud, a dark heaviness moving near you.
[1:09:32] You know what they I've dealt with
[1:09:34] several cases. I mean, had it bad.
[1:09:38] And I said, "Is that what happens?" They
[1:09:40] said, "Yeah, that's exactly what
[1:09:42] happens. I actually can feel it." I
[1:09:44] said, "You know what? That's that demon
[1:09:46] spirit. You're feeling his influence
[1:09:49] moving up on you. But if you don't know
[1:09:53] what it is, you don't know how to handle
[1:09:55] it, you need to say right at that moment
[1:09:58] before he takes a hold of your thoughts
[1:09:59] and bring you negative and bring you
[1:10:01] down and bring you into depression, you
[1:10:03] need to stop right there and say, "Just
[1:10:05] a moment. I know who you are.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; I know who you are and I know your
[1:10:10] tactics and you have no part with me.
[1:10:12] I'm a bloodbought son or daughter of God
[1:10:15] and you have no place
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; and I resist you." actively resist him
[1:10:21] and he has to flee according to the word
[1:10:24] of God and he will flee.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; But if you just mop along, it's going to
[1:10:30] take control of the day and make you
[1:10:32] miserable and then you get miserable and
[1:10:35] you start walking around say I just like
[1:10:36] somebody else to share this misery with
[1:10:38] me. I don't want to be miserable by
[1:10:40] myself. how to make someone else's life
[1:10:43] a day real miserable and then at least
[1:10:45] two of us will be miserable
[1:10:49] and that really works bad in a home.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; It's bad. Now, you can stay there if you
[1:10:54] want, but I I I just don't care for it.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; If you apply something, now we're
[1:11:02] talking about this application. Some of
[1:11:04] you people that are uh workmen in
[1:11:07] construction and so on or whatever more,
[1:11:10] if you're going to apply something,
[1:11:12] that's that's not merely an action word,
[1:11:15] but it's an activity. It's something
[1:11:17] that you do. You're going to apply
[1:11:19] something.
[1:11:20] And it may be that one application's not
[1:11:24] enough. And it might also be well, if
[1:11:27] this application works here, then it
[1:11:29] automatically works over there. Look,
[1:11:31] I'm going to just bring it to to you.
[1:11:32] Right. Right. right down where we all
[1:11:35] live.
[1:11:38] We have the words and we I hear them all
[1:11:41] the time and I don't think people
[1:11:42] understand them. Oh, I've applied the
[1:11:44] token. What did you do? They don't know.
[1:11:47] That's just a phrase. I applied the
[1:11:49] token. I applied the token to my son. I
[1:11:51] applied the token on my daughter. I
[1:11:52] applied the token. I applied the token.
[1:11:55] To apply the token is actually an
[1:11:58] activity. It's an action. I've applied
[1:12:01] the token. what brother Brandham's
[1:12:03] talking about, I'm going to give it to
[1:12:04] you in detail. You actually apply a life
[1:12:07] and influence that person.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; You apply it. You apply it to them. And
[1:12:14] now you've got, you know, one
[1:12:16] application doesn't fit all.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; One application does not fit all. You
[1:12:22] have somebody and maybe you got one
[1:12:24] child. We'll talk about children.
[1:12:26] Parents applying the token to the for
[1:12:29] the children. You got one child and and
[1:12:31] they've got one kind of temperament.
[1:12:33] They've got they've got uh you know
[1:12:36] they've got a certain kind of a
[1:12:38] character and the life you live to
[1:12:41] influence them may well be different
[1:12:44] than the life the atmosphere you create
[1:12:47] around another one
[1:12:50] or or a husband to wife and a wife to
[1:12:53] husband.
[1:12:55] you know,
[1:12:57] uh I guess we all got, you know, certain
[1:13:02] spots which are sensitive and uh and
[1:13:05] I've heard the phrase and you have too
[1:13:07] to say, well, they they know which
[1:13:09] button to push.
[1:13:11] They get a reaction.
[1:13:18] Brother Bram talks about people and how
[1:13:20] different they are.
[1:13:23] you find one person is uh
[1:13:27] real boisterous and you know
[1:13:30] demonstrative and loud and the next
[1:13:34] person's real quiet.
[1:13:36] Well,
[1:13:38] to apply the token to say to one person
[1:13:42] of member of the family or let's just
[1:13:43] talk about the family that's here.
[1:13:47] You know, you have some people that are
[1:13:49] quiet. They're reserved.
[1:13:52] They're I won't say refined, but they're
[1:13:55] just they're just different. They've got
[1:13:56] a quiet, timid spirit.
[1:13:59] And if you want to influence them and
[1:14:03] you want to influence them the right
[1:14:04] way, it's not the same as when you're
[1:14:07] dealing with the next person. Next
[1:14:09] person might be, you know, they're free,
[1:14:11] they're outgoing, they're they're
[1:14:13] whatever more. And you you just deal
[1:14:16] with people that are different. You deal
[1:14:17] with them differently. I'm a pastor. I
[1:14:20] know. I mean, I'm I'm in some homes and
[1:14:21] and homes are relatively quiet and I
[1:14:25] don't go in there and, you know, try to
[1:14:27] have a great big loud time. You just
[1:14:32] kind of flow with it, you know, and be
[1:14:35] whatever whatever that home is, whatever
[1:14:37] that person is.
[1:14:41] I've been around people
[1:14:44] uh that
[1:14:46] they want to share a burden.
[1:14:49] And so I I and I sense that I sense that
[1:14:53] they're they're happy to share a burden.
[1:14:55] And so I may share a burden of the
[1:14:57] church. I may share a burden from a
[1:14:59] family. I may share a burden of the work
[1:15:01] of the Lord and and just tell them and
[1:15:03] and but to the next person that would be
[1:15:06] terribly negative.
[1:15:08] It would just crush them and weight them
[1:15:10] down. And I sense this person, this
[1:15:13] person's not made to handle that at all.
[1:15:18] Brother Brandham said he comes in the
[1:15:20] home and I read it again today. He'll
[1:15:22] have come in the house and the kids are
[1:15:25] fighting and screaming.
[1:15:27] Said that happened in his home. I'm sure
[1:15:28] they did because they had children and
[1:15:31] they're fighting and you know maybe
[1:15:36] yelling and whatever more crying
[1:15:38] and he said even his wife standing there
[1:15:41] at the at the dispan and she's crying as
[1:15:45] well and it's just been that kind of a
[1:15:47] time. Well,
[1:15:50] now I don't know, you know, I don't know
[1:15:53] whether uh uh just how I would handle
[1:15:56] that, but it might be a tense moment,
[1:15:58] you know, but for him, he he went there
[1:16:01] and he just decided he's a creator. He's
[1:16:03] going to create an atmosphere. He just
[1:16:06] got there and started helping her and
[1:16:08] doing the dishes and working with her
[1:16:10] and and created a whole different
[1:16:12] atmosphere. And he said a few minutes
[1:16:14] everything was just nice and quiet and
[1:16:15] peaceful.
[1:16:22] might say, "Well, where's all this
[1:16:23] coming to?"
[1:16:26] Have you ever heard of a pity party?
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; You all have heard of a pity party.
[1:16:32] When we're going through a bad time, we
[1:16:34] like some pity and so, you know, people
[1:16:38] get in a pity party and one starts it
[1:16:42] and then the other one just feeds that
[1:16:44] and then this one feeds this one. and
[1:16:46] oh, they're just having a great time.
[1:16:50] And when they're all done,
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; they're not any higher.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; They're far worse off.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; They've just they've absolutely uh they
[1:16:59] they they have succeeded in destroying
[1:17:01] each other's victory,
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; but they feel better because we got it
[1:17:06] off.
[1:17:08] See, it doesn't work. It does not work.
[1:17:13] I've I've seen it so many so many many
[1:17:15] times.
[1:17:17] So, what do you do in a time like that?
[1:17:20] Well, I just realize that that that will
[1:17:23] not succeed. That won't that won't get
[1:17:25] us any further.
[1:17:28] So, now here's here's what uh brother
[1:17:30] Brandham said about applying.
[1:17:34] He talks about I think it was in a
[1:17:37] message u
[1:17:40] I think it might have been things that
[1:17:41] are to be or modern events one of those
[1:17:44] too he talks about how God made people
[1:17:47] different one loves the mountains one
[1:17:49] hates the mountains one loves the
[1:17:51] prairies one loves the desert one he
[1:17:53] made us all different we're completely
[1:17:56] different and you can't take someone who
[1:17:58] loves the desert and say you're going to
[1:18:01] love the mountains they don't love the
[1:18:03] mountains they were is made that way.
[1:18:06] One person's made quiet, another
[1:18:08] person's made talkative, another
[1:18:10] person's made one way, made the other
[1:18:11] way. But God made us all.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; And we need to be and you that have uh
[1:18:17] you that have, you know, children in
[1:18:19] your families. Listen friends, this
[1:18:22] might this might sound like just uh you
[1:18:25] know
[1:18:27] beef stew and potatoes, but it's really
[1:18:30] needful because I deal with all kinds of
[1:18:33] situations. Even young people and
[1:18:37] parents need to be really discerning
[1:18:41] how they deal with their young people,
[1:18:42] how they deal with their children need
[1:18:44] to be real discerning because the way
[1:18:46] you the way you deal with one and what
[1:18:48] I'm going to talk about dealing the way
[1:18:50] you apply the token to one is absolutely
[1:18:52] opposite to the way you apply the token
[1:18:54] to the other one. Completely opposite
[1:18:57] because this one can take it, the other
[1:18:59] one can't take it and they have to be
[1:19:01] handled exactly differently. And then
[1:19:04] some, you know, young people, they have
[1:19:06] a a real hard time. You deal with a a a
[1:19:09] a young person when they're young and
[1:19:13] apply the token. You can't treat uh a a
[1:19:17] a senior teenager like you treat a
[1:19:20] child.
[1:19:23] And neither can a husband treat a wife
[1:19:26] like they treat their children. You're
[1:19:28] not a child. And you can't treat a wife
[1:19:31] can't treat a husband like he's just one
[1:19:33] of the little boys in the home.
[1:19:37] Now you do this, do that, take the
[1:19:41] garbage out, and you know you have to do
[1:19:43] those things. You don't have to be
[1:19:44] reminded. You got all the things. But if
[1:19:47] you get if you get treated that way,
[1:19:48] pretty soon you start acting that way.
[1:19:52] Just what do you want me to do next,
[1:19:53] dear?
[1:19:59] You'd be surprised what kind of
[1:20:00] atmosphere that that creates. It
[1:20:03] actually creates an atmosphere. But if
[1:20:05] one and the other and if each have a
[1:20:08] real respect for one another, an
[1:20:10] acknowledgement of one another,
[1:20:13] another one each for their position. You
[1:20:16] know what you're actually doing? You are
[1:20:18] creating an atmosphere and you're
[1:20:20] applying something to the home.
[1:20:23] you're actually applying something to
[1:20:25] their lives.
[1:20:29] Brother Brandham says in the token, now
[1:20:31] this is the token.
[1:20:33] He opens with these words, flee for
[1:20:36] safety,
[1:20:37] then apply.
[1:20:39] And here's what you want to Here's what
[1:20:43] here's what you want to believe for. You
[1:20:46] want for your own safety.
[1:20:49] You believe for your safety. and then
[1:20:52] apply the token for the whole family.
[1:20:56] Now, just stop. You've used that term
[1:20:57] before. What do you mean by it? I'm
[1:21:00] telling you what I believe by it for the
[1:21:03] service tonight. But what do you mean by
[1:21:04] it? Say, well, I've applied the token.
[1:21:06] What did you do?
[1:21:10] It'd be good for you to answer that to
[1:21:11] yourself. If you've ever used that
[1:21:13] phrase, I've applied the token. What did
[1:21:15] you do when you applied the token? I'm
[1:21:17] going to tell you what he said. And in
[1:21:20] fact is you'll find the word apply over
[1:21:22] and over and over and over again. And I
[1:21:25] believe that as as believers I believe
[1:21:28] we have a responsibility
[1:21:30] to create an atmosphere. You might say,
[1:21:34] "Well, I haven't got any responsible for
[1:21:35] I'm not responsible for the young person
[1:21:37] beside me." Well, a phrase has been
[1:21:41] going over and over and over in my mind,
[1:21:43] and it's the words of Cain.
[1:21:48] And he said, "Am I my brother's keeper?
[1:21:52] Am I my brother's keeper?" Well, yeah,
[1:21:54] we are.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; We are our brother's keeper.
[1:21:59] We're there to keep, to strengthen, to
[1:22:02] build one another up so that when they
[1:22:05] move out of our presence, they can say,
[1:22:08] "I've been encouraged. I've been
[1:22:10] strengthened. I have been very much
[1:22:13] helped from this visit, from this
[1:22:16] atmosphere that I've just been in. I
[1:22:19] challenge you to create an atmosphere
[1:22:21] for one another. Be active, be
[1:22:24] proactive.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Talk talk encouraging to one another.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; So he says, "Then apply the token." He
[1:22:36] said, "You believe for your safety, then
[1:22:38] apply the token for the whole family.
[1:22:42] You say how can I do that? He answers a
[1:22:45] he asked the question how can I do that?
[1:22:49] He said number one claim it. It worked
[1:22:52] for you. Then you and the word become
[1:22:56] one.
[1:22:58] He said it works for both of you. You
[1:23:01] and the word are one. Then apply it to
[1:23:04] your children. Apply it to your loved
[1:23:07] ones like Rahab did. She applied the
[1:23:10] token to her father. She applied it to
[1:23:13] her mother. She applied it to her
[1:23:15] brothers and sisters and got them all
[1:23:19] in.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Then he says, "You apply it.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; She applied it to her mother. She
[1:23:25] applied it to her father." And listen,
[1:23:28] she had the token, but she didn't even
[1:23:30] know that she had the token. She didn't
[1:23:32] know what the token was. And they told
[1:23:35] her where to put it. They told her how
[1:23:37] to apply it. They told two spies told
[1:23:42] her how to apply it. These are two
[1:23:44] spies.
[1:23:46] They aren't even prophets. They're two
[1:23:49] spies. They're two soldiers. And they
[1:23:52] told Rahab what to do with that scarlet
[1:23:55] thread and put it in the window. And
[1:23:58] they she did it and her life was spared.
[1:24:01] Is this a myth or is it happening? Did
[1:24:03] that actually happen?
[1:24:06] And so they spoke it and told her. They
[1:24:08] didn't leave her any message book. They
[1:24:09] just told her, "This is what you do. You
[1:24:12] have it. You put it in the window and
[1:24:14] your place will be spared."
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; And the walls were going to come down
[1:24:18] and her house was on top of the walls.
[1:24:20] And it sounds like a fairy tale, but
[1:24:22] that according to the word of God
[1:24:25] happened exactly like that. And if that
[1:24:28] happened,
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; can't we trust a prophet and make us
[1:24:33] active enough to say this is what you
[1:24:35] do?
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; And I don't care. It may be in in, you
[1:24:39] know, in my uh feeble way this evening,
[1:24:42] but I could I could preach and I could
[1:24:44] narrow it down a whole lot because I
[1:24:46] don't want to, you know, I don't want to
[1:24:48] get too heavy with it. But the word of
[1:24:50] God is calling on us to apply the token.
[1:24:54] In other words, apply this kind of life.
[1:24:57] We are responsible to one another. We
[1:25:01] are fathers. You are responsible for
[1:25:03] your home to live the kind of life that
[1:25:06] those children and those around you are
[1:25:09] going to admire. And I want them to be
[1:25:11] able to say, I want to live that kind of
[1:25:14] a life. I want to be that kind of a
[1:25:17] person. Is this is this too high to
[1:25:19] reach? No, I don't think it's too high
[1:25:21] to reach at all. I to say that's right
[1:25:23] within our reach. God would not have
[1:25:25] given it to us unless he knew that we
[1:25:28] had it in our in our place. You've got
[1:25:31] it exactly like Rahab had it. She had
[1:25:34] that scarlet thread. You have it. You
[1:25:37] have the token. The prophet said you
[1:25:39] have the token. And I believe you have
[1:25:41] the token. I have the token.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're living in a time of
[1:25:47] this is a time when destruction's on its
[1:25:50] way.
[1:25:53] lives are being shattered.
[1:25:58] How come you are where you're at?
[1:26:01] How come God has given you what you
[1:26:03] possess?
[1:26:05] What what has done that? Well, we can
[1:26:07] say, well, it's just a a grace. It's
[1:26:09] amazing grace. But it's even more than
[1:26:11] that. It is that the word is preached.
[1:26:13] We hear it. We believe it. We act upon
[1:26:17] it. And when we act upon it, we are
[1:26:19] applying something not only to
[1:26:21] ourselves, he says for your own safety.
[1:26:24] That's why we do it. We do it for our
[1:26:26] own safety. And then once you have it,
[1:26:29] then you apply it to someone else.
[1:26:31] That's exactly what he said. You can't
[1:26:33] get anything else out of that out of
[1:26:35] that token message than that. Then you
[1:26:36] apply it.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; It didn't say how impossible it is or
[1:26:41] how hopeless it is. It may be utterly
[1:26:44] hopeless, but you apply it. You believe
[1:26:47] it. And when you believe it, you confess
[1:26:50] it. How long shall you confess it? As he
[1:26:52] said, say it until you believe it.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Keep saying it.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; You keep applying it.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; It's not for us here to discuss. This
[1:27:02] one looks good. This one looks
[1:27:03] promising. This one looks impossible. It
[1:27:06] had nothing to do with it.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; She just Rahab asked for I want a I want
[1:27:11] a true token from you,
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; a true promise. you'll save me.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they said, "We'll save
[1:27:21] everything that's in your house as long
[1:27:23] as they're here." And you keep your vow
[1:27:25] and you don't tell our our mission here.
[1:27:28] You keep this secret. And you and
[1:27:31] everyone that's in this house will be
[1:27:33] safe
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; and they will not be destroyed in the
[1:27:36] judgment of God. And I'm going to I'm
[1:27:39] putting my confidence in a vindicated
[1:27:42] word.
[1:27:46] Does it look impossible? Yes. Many of
[1:27:48] them look impossible. And I don't know
[1:27:50] how it's going to happen. But he said,
[1:27:52] "You live the life. I'm doing everything
[1:27:54] I know how to live the life in front of
[1:27:57] them. I want to live it. And if I have
[1:27:59] to go by the way of the grave, I want to
[1:28:01] at least have the testimony." He lived
[1:28:03] what he believed.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; He held steady.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Showed the character of Christ. I want
[1:28:09] that. Ask him to forgive me every time
[1:28:12] we don't. We're all human. We go through
[1:28:16] those times. But I tell you what,
[1:28:20] I'm doing everything we know to do. He
[1:28:22] said, "Claim it. It worked for you,
[1:28:24] didn't it? Worked for you. You're here
[1:28:27] on a Wednesday evening. Did it work for
[1:28:29] you?"
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Now, he's saying if it worked for you,
[1:28:33] then you can make it work for someone
[1:28:35] else
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; out of your own life.
[1:28:40] You know what I like about this? Some
[1:28:41] people say, "Well, I can't I can't
[1:28:43] really testify." You can this way.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Some people say, "I'm not good with
[1:28:48] words." You don't have to be good with
[1:28:49] words. You have to just be good with
[1:28:51] obedience to the word. You have it in
[1:28:54] you. You live it. You let the t You let
[1:28:57] the light and it'll it'll beacon out
[1:28:59] somebody that's not even in the sound of
[1:29:01] your words. They can't even hear you
[1:29:04] because they live in another city. They
[1:29:05] live in another country, but they still
[1:29:08] get the effect of your life.
[1:29:10] You'd be surprised where that goes.
[1:29:17] Said, "How can I do that?" You claim it,
[1:29:20] then you apply it to your children.
[1:29:22] Apply it to your loved ones.
[1:29:25] Get them all in. He said, "You apply it.
[1:29:27] Say,"Lord,
[1:29:28] I'm going after my son." That's what he
[1:29:30] said. Say,
[1:29:33] didn't say hear it. Said say it. I'm
[1:29:37] going after my son. I'm going after my
[1:29:40] daughter. I claim her, Satan. You turn
[1:29:44] her loose. I'm coming after her. I apply
[1:29:48] the token. It's not some It's not some
[1:29:52] figment of your imagination. I'm going
[1:29:53] to apply the token. I'm going to apply
[1:29:55] the token. It's not It's not something
[1:29:57] that you just get down and grunt out in
[1:29:59] prayer. It's a life that you live. I'm
[1:30:02] going to live this before them. They're
[1:30:04] going to have this testimony and I'm
[1:30:06] going to live this life in front of
[1:30:08] them. Hallelujah. And you are applying
[1:30:12] applying your life applying the token to
[1:30:16] them. It's an application.
[1:30:19] And this person might need one kind of
[1:30:20] application. That person need another.
[1:30:22] The young people, the teenagers, they
[1:30:24] need one kind of application. Another
[1:30:27] couple, a single sister, a brother, they
[1:30:29] need a different kind. Someone who's in
[1:30:30] a hardship, they need a certain kind of
[1:30:32] application. The other one that is have
[1:30:35] everything's coming up, you know, roses
[1:30:37] and pieces and cream. They need a
[1:30:38] different kind of application. So, we
[1:30:40] have to be almost all things to all
[1:30:43] people. But you have it within you.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; One time Jesus would cry out, next time
[1:30:50] he'd be silent. Sometime he'd just send
[1:30:53] his word and heal him. You know, he give
[1:30:55] the biatitudes on the mountains and and
[1:30:57] and and he he was different at different
[1:31:00] times because that what was he doing? He
[1:31:02] was applying, not only applying and
[1:31:05] creating an atmosphere for the
[1:31:07] believers, for those that would follow
[1:31:09] him, but also bringing a a judgment on
[1:31:12] those that were rejecting it.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; He said, I apply the token, oh Holy
[1:31:23] Spirit that lives within me, catch my
[1:31:27] daughter there. I'm going to her now
[1:31:30] with your anointing upon me. You will do
[1:31:33] it. Not will you do it. You will do it.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; I say amen.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; See, people have lived the life in Acts
[1:31:42] 16 and31. He's quoting Paul told the
[1:31:46] centurion, "Believe.
[1:31:48] I'm a messenger of the hour. Believe on
[1:31:51] the Lord Jesus Christ. Thou and thy
[1:31:53] house shall be saved. Believe for your
[1:31:56] house. Bring them all under it. Now
[1:31:59] you've seen the God of heaven perform a
[1:32:01] miracle just before judgment. You
[1:32:03] believe it? Yes. What can I do? He said,
[1:32:06] "Rise and be baptized." And he did it.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; He did it.
[1:32:12] The man obeyed the word. Paul took him
[1:32:15] and baptized him. He said, "Now believe
[1:32:17] on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou and
[1:32:20] thy house shall be saved."
[1:32:23] He said, "Brother, believe what? Believe
[1:32:25] the Lord Jesus Christ for your house. He
[1:32:28] said, "Believe the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:32:29] your house." And he puts it in different
[1:32:31] words. Apply
[1:32:33] the token to your house.
[1:32:37] Then what do you do? Then what do you do
[1:32:40] when you apply it to your house? Move
[1:32:42] all the trash out.
[1:32:45] Get all the short skirts and the shorts
[1:32:48] and the cards and the cigarettes and the
[1:32:50] televisions and whatever more and kick
[1:32:52] them out the door. You're going to apply
[1:32:54] the token.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; That's what you do next.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Clean house.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Like Jacob did said, "Wash your clothes
[1:33:11] and everything. Put away your gods."
[1:33:14] Joshua did the same thing. Then he said
[1:33:17] he was getting ready. He was getting
[1:33:19] ready. That's active. He was getting
[1:33:21] ready. They were applying the token.
[1:33:24] They were getting ready
[1:33:27] before they moved out. Before Joshua
[1:33:31] moved out, he instructed them what to
[1:33:33] do. Clean house.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; He said they were getting ready. He puts
[1:33:39] it in other words. They were applying
[1:33:41] the token.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Same language.
[1:33:49] He said, "Amen. That's it. Get ready.
[1:33:52] And the reason I'm reading this is
[1:33:53] because I want you to notice how many
[1:33:55] times he used apply the token. Applying
[1:33:59] the token and and and relating it and
[1:34:03] connecting it with getting ready and
[1:34:06] doing these other things. He said, "Get
[1:34:08] ready. Apply it. Believe it. Clean up.
[1:34:11] Let your children, let your family, let
[1:34:14] your loved ones see it in you." And
[1:34:18] that's right. He said, "It'll take
[1:34:19] effect."
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; He didn't say when, but it'll take
[1:34:23] effect. Let them see it in you.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Let them see it by getting say, "Well,
[1:34:30] I'm getting ready. I'm cleaning things
[1:34:32] up. I'm making changes in my life."
[1:34:34] Maybe there's something that, you know,
[1:34:37] sometimes we make a decision. I'm going
[1:34:39] to do a certain thing. And then you you
[1:34:42] start on that direction. You start doing
[1:34:44] it. And then you start feeling I'm not
[1:34:46] comfortable with that. I really don't
[1:34:48] feel comfortable.
[1:34:50] I go here and you know have this
[1:34:53] activity and I don't feel comfortable.
[1:34:56] I've it happens with me quite often. I
[1:34:59] go to go to a restaurant. I've seen
[1:35:01] restaurants. The devil's a slicker. You
[1:35:04] start a restaurant and the waitresses
[1:35:06] are nicely dressed. They'll come and
[1:35:08] serve you and the food's so excellent.
[1:35:10] You think this is a great place.
[1:35:13] And over a period of short time,
[1:35:16] you'll see the waitresses
[1:35:18] and they're almost unclothed
[1:35:21] and it's a disgrace
[1:35:24] and I don't feel comfortable. And I say
[1:35:27] I wouldn't want to bring a minister in
[1:35:30] here
[1:35:32] and I certainly wouldn't want to bring
[1:35:34] the Lord Jesus in here and I certainly
[1:35:37] wouldn't want to bring brother Brandham
[1:35:39] here. I'd be terribly embarrassed and I
[1:35:41] just make a decision. I'm done.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Let this place go.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; You know it works.
[1:35:51] I don't know, brother Don. You were
[1:35:53] here. I'm sure you're one of us. We used
[1:35:55] to go down here to the Clover Inn when
[1:35:57] the town was just a little one-horse
[1:35:59] town, no traffic lights. This place has
[1:36:02] grown so much, but it actually was that
[1:36:05] that in the Clover Inn. They had an old
[1:36:08] Ukrainian lady. Of course, she's
[1:36:09] Ukrainian. She knew how to cook.
[1:36:13] and the nicest cinnamon buns. Great big
[1:36:16] cinnamon buns. I'm not selling them
[1:36:17] because they're not there anymore, but
[1:36:20] don't go running down there. And the
[1:36:22] Briner family and my wife and I, we'd go
[1:36:24] down there every once in a while and
[1:36:27] have a breakfast of a on a Saturday
[1:36:29] morning. And I it was just marvelous the
[1:36:32] kind of breakfast they'd serve. And then
[1:36:34] couple young fellas bought it. They
[1:36:36] bought the place. First thing I noticed
[1:36:38] the signs, you know,
[1:36:41] beer and drinks available at the at the
[1:36:45] table. They never used to do that. And
[1:36:48] then they turned a big section of it
[1:36:50] into a like a cocktail lounge in another
[1:36:52] room, but the the the cocktail girls
[1:36:55] walking through the restaurant and it
[1:36:57] was kind of floozy floozy flowing gowns
[1:37:01] and I I felt uncomfortable. And finally,
[1:37:04] you know, that just happened two or
[1:37:05] three times and a bunch of us brothers
[1:37:07] were in there and we said, "We walk out
[1:37:10] of this place in the name of the Lord
[1:37:12] Jesus Christ and we shake the dust off
[1:37:15] our feet and God's against this place."
[1:37:17] And then three weeks later, it burned to
[1:37:19] the ground.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that was just an
[1:37:21] accident. It was a wonderful accident."
[1:37:24] I don't care what you want to attribute
[1:37:25] it to. I attribute it to exactly that we
[1:37:28] walked out of that place and turned that
[1:37:30] thing over and we're not going to be
[1:37:32] there anymore. Is there anything wrong
[1:37:34] with that?
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; No, not at all. And I think that as far
[1:37:38] as us brothers were concerned, we
[1:37:39] strengthened one another. So, we don't
[1:37:41] support this kind of thing. We're out of
[1:37:43] here.
[1:37:46] It happened the other day in the car.
[1:37:48] Said, "Where you going to when are you
[1:37:50] going to where are you going to take
[1:37:50] this, brother?" I said, "Well, I'm we've
[1:37:53] nixed that place and we've nixed that
[1:37:55] place, so we'll go to another place."
[1:37:58] My wife says, "Well, I'm glad. Wouldn't
[1:38:01] want to go there. council a brother in
[1:38:03] that kind of an atmosphere. Not at all.
[1:38:05] We're going to another place.
[1:38:08] You might think it's just small things.
[1:38:11] Well, you know what? I think it's
[1:38:13] relatively small thing, too, to have a
[1:38:15] have a basin full of blood and painting
[1:38:17] it on the post of the door and over the
[1:38:19] l of the door. I think that's a pretty
[1:38:21] small thing, too. There isn't anybody
[1:38:23] that couldn't do it, but it was a
[1:38:25] critical thing. It needed to be done.
[1:38:27] And those children needed to see their
[1:38:28] dad hear what the prophet said and
[1:38:31] didn't care whether this has never
[1:38:33] happened before. We've never done
[1:38:34] anything like this before. This is very
[1:38:36] very strange. But it was the thing to do
[1:38:39] because he said it. And if he said it,
[1:38:42] what's wrong with doing it? It can be as
[1:38:44] simple as can be. Say, I never done this
[1:38:45] before. But if he said it, do it.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; I would sooner do something I didn't
[1:38:53] understand knowing that it came out of a
[1:38:55] vindicated mouth. I would sooner do that
[1:38:57] than sit back and try to figure out my
[1:38:59] own way.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Can I have just about five minutes? I'm
[1:39:07] going to close. Going to close
[1:39:10] because here we come right back. The
[1:39:12] reason why I talked about creating an
[1:39:13] atmosphere because in this long quote in
[1:39:16] the token, he comes right to it.
[1:39:19] He said, "Then apply the token in
[1:39:22] prayer.
[1:39:24] It's not just I'm the head of this home
[1:39:26] and you do that and you do this and you
[1:39:29] do something else. That's not the way it
[1:39:30] works.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; We apply the token in prayer. We apply
[1:39:35] the token, he said, in consideration,
[1:39:38] with believing. Apply it with such love.
[1:39:43] Such love.
[1:39:48] Well, I will tell this.
[1:39:53] There was a incredible move of God
[1:39:57] where brother Chris Berg, who was a real
[1:39:59] friend of brother Brandhams, a real
[1:40:01] friend of his.
[1:40:05] And brother Chris prayed for five years
[1:40:07] up in the Arctic because he hearded
[1:40:10] reindeer and he had to move with the
[1:40:11] reindeer.
[1:40:13] And that man was such a man of prayer.
[1:40:17] And this came from another man. Brother
[1:40:19] Chris didn't even tell me this. This
[1:40:21] came from another man.
[1:40:23] And he told brother Chris being in his
[1:40:26] tent and all all uh banked up with snow.
[1:40:32] And brother brother Breta, my
[1:40:34] brother-in-law and my sister know him
[1:40:36] real well. In fact is I think my sister
[1:40:38] gave him his last lunch just before he
[1:40:41] went out and and died of I think a heart
[1:40:44] attack. They've known him all, you know,
[1:40:47] much of their lives. Brother Chris Berg
[1:40:51] prayed for a revival amongst the Eskimo
[1:40:53] people, prayed for their salvation, and
[1:40:56] in five years he never saw one give
[1:40:58] their life to Christ.
[1:41:01] One one night he was in he was in prayer
[1:41:05] in the tent and his tent, you know,
[1:41:08] right where the little stove, the pipe
[1:41:10] goes through the canvas, there's
[1:41:12] supposed to be a metal collar there
[1:41:14] around the pipe and the metal collar had
[1:41:18] come off off the canvas and it wasn't
[1:41:20] there.
[1:41:22] And the little fire was going in that
[1:41:25] little we stove and he was in prayer and
[1:41:27] he was so deep in prayer and I have
[1:41:30] heard him in prayer. I've seen him in
[1:41:31] prayer. My wife has seen him in prayer.
[1:41:34] I've seen that little man get in prayer.
[1:41:36] And he was so locked in prayer and so
[1:41:39] lost in God that his tent caught fire
[1:41:42] and burned down around him. And he
[1:41:45] wasn't even aware that it had burned
[1:41:46] down. Can you believe that? His tent and
[1:41:49] of course canvas just goes like, you
[1:41:52] know, just goes like well just like
[1:41:55] that. And that tent burned down. And
[1:41:59] when he opened his eyes, he was looking
[1:42:01] at the stars and he thought he'd crossed
[1:42:04] over.
[1:42:06] He thought he was on the other side, but
[1:42:08] I think the 50°ree weather probably told
[1:42:10] him he wasn't.
[1:42:13] But he never saw anybody get saved. And
[1:42:16] I had a a man come to our church when we
[1:42:19] were up in Dawson Creek and he said,
[1:42:21] "Where's Chris Berg?" I want to say
[1:42:23] Chris Berg. We had such a move of God
[1:42:26] and the people started coming and they
[1:42:28] packed the place out and they came to
[1:42:30] the altars and they wept and they
[1:42:33] surrendered their lives to Christ. They
[1:42:35] were totally transformed people. And he
[1:42:37] says when they came up off their knees,
[1:42:38] he says, "Where's Chris Berg? He's the
[1:42:41] one who told us about this. He told us
[1:42:43] about this. One of those men who got up
[1:42:49] had committed adultery with another
[1:42:52] man's wife.
[1:42:56] And when he got up from prayer, he knew
[1:42:58] he had to make that right.
[1:43:02] He got up and he went to the little
[1:43:04] shack where the other man lived. And he
[1:43:06] had got become a Christian as well. And
[1:43:09] he stood on his front step
[1:43:13] and knocked on his door
[1:43:15] and told him, "I committed adultery with
[1:43:20] your wife."
[1:43:22] And the man inside
[1:43:24] threw himself around this man's
[1:43:26] shoulders and hugged him and said, "You
[1:43:30] are forgiven.
[1:43:32] I forgive you." Now, that friends is the
[1:43:35] kind of love the prophet's talking
[1:43:37] about.
[1:43:39] That's the kind of love. That's the kind
[1:43:42] of love that he's talking about.
[1:43:47] When you can have something that just
[1:43:48] wrenches you emotionally
[1:43:51] and you think it's going to destroy your
[1:43:53] entire life.
[1:43:55] Love is stronger than that hurt. Love is
[1:43:58] stronger than the sin. Love is stronger
[1:44:01] than anything. He said it's the most
[1:44:04] powerful force in the world. It doesn't
[1:44:06] give allowance for those things, but it
[1:44:09] it's a standard
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; by which and and that's what he said.
[1:44:13] Can you say amen to that? Amen.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; And those two natives right there
[1:44:18] embraced one another
[1:44:20] and the one forgave the other.
[1:44:24] That's love.
[1:44:29] And he said in closing,
[1:44:31] he said, "Apply it and create the
[1:44:34] atmosphere around you that they'll just
[1:44:38] drop right into it. And if you've got
[1:44:40] the token, you create a spirit around
[1:44:43] you of power that when you walk, people
[1:44:46] know that you're a Christian. They love
[1:44:49] for you to say something to them. They
[1:44:51] believe your word. What you say, they
[1:44:54] hold on to it. Apply the token, then
[1:44:57] walk with it. Claim your household. You
[1:44:59] must do it now. This is the evening
[1:45:02] time. Now, you've been listening a long
[1:45:05] time and this is a evening time. It's
[1:45:09] applying time now. The wrath will strike
[1:45:12] one of these days and it might be too
[1:45:15] late then. So apply the token with
[1:45:19] confidence.
[1:45:22] I thank the Lord
[1:45:24] for this kind of instruction.
[1:45:29] Sometimes it's good to even hear
[1:45:30] something that goes straight over your
[1:45:32] head. That's too strong for me. That's
[1:45:35] too that's that's over my head. But what
[1:45:38] you want to do is be able to say a
[1:45:42] vindicated voice said it and I know that
[1:45:45] it's absolutely possible. It's within my
[1:45:47] realm because I am a believer of it.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to have you stand and I
[1:45:54] want to sing 9004
[1:45:58] Let the Death Angel Pass.
[1:46:04] Let's just sing the chorus first, shall
[1:46:06] we? Please,
[1:46:14] let's bow our heads.
[1:46:18] Father,
[1:46:20] you're the author of this word
[1:46:23] and you're the one that has vindicated
[1:46:26] it. You're the one that has confirmed
[1:46:28] it. And we are thankful for that. I'm so
[1:46:31] thankful this evening for the leadership
[1:46:35] that you give us, the direction you show
[1:46:39] us, and that you'll even say things that
[1:46:42] within ourselves we think,
[1:46:46] can I attain that? Can I actually reach
[1:46:48] that? But there's something there's a
[1:46:51] spirit witnessing within and telling us
[1:46:54] that this is our inheritance.
[1:46:56] It is our inheritance. Lord, I would
[1:46:59] like to experience myself the degree of
[1:47:02] love that you have expressed, that
[1:47:05] you've spoken of, that you've said is a
[1:47:07] reality. And don't let this congregation
[1:47:10] sit back and say, "I'll just settle with
[1:47:12] what I have." Let us move on out, Lord.
[1:47:15] Let us move into that holy of holies.
[1:47:18] Let us move into this shikina glory
[1:47:21] where we can have such communion and
[1:47:23] fellowship.
[1:47:25] It's for us, Lord. It's our portion, oh
[1:47:28] God. And I pray for this service this
[1:47:30] evening. And the people that are
[1:47:32] gathered here, whatever they may have,
[1:47:34] whatever they may be holding in their
[1:47:37] heart, oh God, in the name of Jesus, I
[1:47:40] claim that it'll be made correct. I pray
[1:47:42] that it'll be made right. Deal with
[1:47:44] every heart, Lord. And may every man,
[1:47:47] woman, and young person say what I I'm
[1:47:50] uncomfortable with what I've been
[1:47:51] allowing. I've been uncomfortable about
[1:47:53] where I'm going. I'll change my course,
[1:47:56] Lord. I'm going to honor you. Who'll
[1:47:58] say, "Amen. I want to do that,
[1:48:01] God. Grant them. Grant them the courage.
[1:48:06] Don't let them settle for less. Grant
[1:48:08] them the courage. Oh God, myself also,
[1:48:12] Father, I pray that it will be obedient
[1:48:14] at each turn of the road. Each time we
[1:48:17] feel an influence from that divine
[1:48:20] realm, we'll be so willing and ready and
[1:48:23] quick to answer and a positive answer.
[1:48:27] In Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen.
[1:48:30] Amen. Let the death angel pass.
[1:48:38] God's bride safe at last.
[1:48:42] [Music]
[1:48:44] in the token he gave
[1:48:49] that we could be saved.
[1:48:55] Oh hallelu
[1:49:00] and glory to God.
[1:49:06] The blood's been applied. The spirit
[1:49:10] abides. Let the death angel pass.
[1:49:15] Oh, we sing it with victory.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Let the death angel pass
[1:49:28] in the token he
[1:49:33] that we could be saved.
[1:49:39] Oh hallelujah
[1:49:44] and glory to Godless

[1:51:31] is open today.
[1:51:36] And those who are hungry,
[1:51:39] [Music]
[1:51:41] God said would be
[1:51:46] outside of this.
[1:51:51] The lost will be found.

[1:52:03] living
[1:52:08] angel
[1:52:09] [Music]
[1:52:23] that we could be saved.

[1:52:28] Oh, hallelujah.

[1:52:39] [Music]
[1:52:44] Let the angel pass.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:52:55] The blood's been applied.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; His spirit abides.
[1:53:02] Let the death angel pass.
[1:53:06] I believe there'll be a time.
[1:53:09] There certainly will be a time
[1:53:11] we're going to meet in another place.
[1:53:14] And all of these words and all of these
[1:53:16] things are going to have such a depth of
[1:53:18] meaning to us
[1:53:22] when we reach the other side. And that's
[1:53:25] why we're here tonight. Amen.
[1:53:30] A dismiss in prayer.
[1:53:33] Blessed Lord Jesus,
[1:53:36] you certainly have applied a token to us
[1:53:38] by the Holy Spirit, but we saw a life
[1:53:42] that was lived.
[1:53:44] I hold here in my hand what the world
[1:53:48] calls the Bible.
[1:53:51] But to us who believe, it's much more
[1:53:53] than a book.
[1:53:55] It's the record of one from Genesis to
[1:53:58] Revelation.
[1:54:00] It is the revelation of one life, the
[1:54:04] life of our Lord Jesus Christ. We see
[1:54:07] you reflected all through the scriptures
[1:54:10] in the Old Testament and then for a
[1:54:13] short period, Lord, a very short period,
[1:54:17] such a short life.
[1:54:20] But what an impact
[1:54:23] upon the entire globe ever since. Just a
[1:54:28] short life, but so powerful.
[1:54:32] Tonight, Lord, I give you all the glory
[1:54:36] for the life that you lived and you've
[1:54:39] left an indelible print upon our lives.
[1:54:43] You've applied the token to us. And when
[1:54:47] we read in the scripture, we feel that
[1:54:50] application coming into our being.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; So changes us and transforms us. You
[1:54:58] create an atmosphere, Lord. Even though
[1:55:00] they can say you live 2,000 years ago,
[1:55:03] it's not 2,000 years ago. Here tonight,
[1:55:06] here amongst us. I feel that atmosphere
[1:55:09] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Your spirit
[1:55:13] creating an atmosphere for us. And in
[1:55:16] that atmosphere, we want to be like you.
[1:55:18] It's no wonder that songwriters and
[1:55:20] poets have given so many words to
[1:55:23] wanting to be like Jesus Christ. People
[1:55:26] have tried to attain that we cannot do
[1:55:28] within ourselves, but you've applied a
[1:55:31] token and given us the sweet Holy
[1:55:34] Spirit. And so tonight, Lord, it gives
[1:55:36] me a sense of peace and joy and
[1:55:41] happiness to be able to commit the words
[1:55:44] that have been spoken and this people
[1:55:47] that have received it. I commit them to
[1:55:49] you. They're your lovely bride. You have
[1:55:52] purchased them. You will watch over
[1:55:55] them. You will keep them. And I pray,
[1:55:57] Father, until the next appointed time,
[1:56:00] the season when we gather here once
[1:56:02] again on the Lord's day, keep keep them
[1:56:07] through thy truth. Thy word is truth.
[1:56:10] This was your prayer, Lord Jesus, and it
[1:56:13] certainly will be fulfilled. Bless your
[1:56:16] people, I pray. Dismiss us with your
[1:56:19] grace, I ask in Jesus Christ's name. And
[1:56:23] we said, amen. So be it. God bless you.
[1:56:27] Read one another. And I don't know, was
[1:56:30] there a practice after? All right. God
[1:56:33] bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus
[1:56:34] name. Amen.
