We are so privileged, Lord God, to be able to approach you that we have a channel open. And as your prophet and messenger declared how Job had a channel, he had an avenue, a channel by revelation, we know that you have revealed yourself to us. Lord, we would certainly not know. We could not understand the things that you have caused us to know. You have made yourself known. &gt;&gt; You've made the scriptures clear. It is though you have directed our thoughts and taken command of our minds and have said to us as your children, you shall know these things. You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. Lord, we have such a positive promise and we stand there firmly with our feet, oh God, established upon the covenant that you have made. You're not a man that you can lie. You shall fulfill every word that you have promised to your children. This evening, Lord, we've come to worship not only with in song and with our lips, but we've come to worship you with our lives and our presence here. And we pray that your presence will overshadow us and flow around us and permeate us through and through. And we want to glorify you. All glory to the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelu. Hallelujah. We praise you, Lord. We praise you, Lord. You're worthy. You're the only worthy one. We give glory to you, oh God. Thank you for redemption. Thank you for Calvary where the serpent's head was crushed. &gt;&gt; We have that victory tonight. &gt;&gt; Glory to your name. Illuminate us now, Lord, as we read your word in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. If you have your Bibles, we're going to turn to Exodus the 3 chapter. and this morning speaking uh reading and speaking from first Peter. We won't read there, but just while you're turning to Exodus 3, the verse I took my text from was, "But you are a chosen generation and a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light." That's our purpose in life. And this is a holy nation. And I have inserted in there a holy resourcerich nation. &gt;&gt; We are resourceri might be that we need to develop some of these resources. Might need we need to refine some of them. &gt;&gt; But we are resourcerich. Now, I'm going to read in Exodus, and we're having baptism tonight as well. Two of our precious young people are being baptized, and uh we're so happy about that. Exodus uh 3. Now, what we're going to do is I'm going to just read a few verses and then if you'll keep your Bible open, you may want to refer back to it. Uh I'll start with verse one. And we'll read down to verse four. And then we'll go to verse 10. Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock on to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire, out of the midst of a bush. And he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, "I will turn now aside. I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt." And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called him unto him out of the midst of the bush and said, "Moses, Moses." And he said, "Here am I." Verse 10. Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt. And Moses said unto God, Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? And he said, Certainly, I will be with thee, and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee, when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God upon this mountain. And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, the God of your fathers hath sent me unto you, and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say unto them? And God said unto Moses, I am that I am. And he said, thou thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I am hath sent me unto you. And amen. God bless you as you have your seats. When we speak of resources, we speak of of potentials. Brother Brandham said, and I'll give the quote later on, he said that the burning bush had what Moses lacked. So the potentials uh Moses had certain potentials but they needed to be developed by what was in the burning bush. I don't know just exactly how uh to bring it to you and I don't know exactly how God will deal with you in trying to comprehend and recognize that the very one that was in that burning bush was in Houston, Texas allowed his photograph to be taken &gt;&gt; the same pillar of fire for a third exodus in this generation And as Moses said, I'll turn aside now and see this one day something touched you. And you said, I haven't heard anything like this. I haven't seen anything like I haven't seen this kind of manifestation. Haven't seen this kind of people. I I I I'm going to turn aside now. And you turned aside and something began to speak to you. &gt;&gt; Something began to get you. &gt;&gt; I looked down our brother Peter Girtson. He drove past and saw some children from the school playing in the parking lot and something caught him. Said, "I haven't seen that. I haven't seen girls dressed like those young girls are." Something caught him and from that time it's been different &gt;&gt; for you. something caught a hold of you and you saw something and you turned aside for a moment said I will look and see what this sight is and to every seed of God once you turned aside and that which caught your attention had what you needed. And that same pillar of fire was not merely in the burning bush on the back side of the desert near the mount of God of Horeb was not merely in Houston, Texas and photographed but and and I don't want you to take this lightly. That same pillar of fire, that very presence, that very intelligence that spoke to Moses is right here in this building. And if you can believe that, if you can lay hold of that and say, "Oh, God, I believe that with all that's in me, God will do something for you." And this just may be a night that God wants to begin moving in your own life and move you further. A a potential is something that is has capacity. The encyclopedia says it's having potential is having capacity for existence. May not exist at this present moment, but it has capacity for existence to exist. It's a potential. potential is something that's possible but it hasn't it's not actual yet. It isn't it hasn't come into being yet but it has it has the uh capacity and there may be things that are as I speak you might feel that's beyond me. Uh you know I I' I'd like to believe that. I'd really do I do believe it but I just don't know if I can grasp it. I don't know if I can uh apprehend it. Well, there are things that Paul, he said that he was pressing toward the mark. He was saying that he wanted to apprehend that for which he had been apprehended. He wanted to seize that. And he would not be saying that if he had already seized it. So he said, "It's out there. It's beyond me. But I am not stopping. I am reaching forward. I am laying hold. I am believing that and I will lay hold of it and apprehend it. Apprehend means you don't just take a hold of it and let go of it. You apprehend these police brothers. They apprehend a prisoner. They secure him and bring him to wherever they're they plan to uh you know take him. Well, that's exactly you have been apprehended and uh and we want to apprehend that for which we have been apprehended. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh I I also would like to just make this general comment. I don't think there's anything wrong with aiming high. And I don't think that there's anything wrong with aiming too high. I don't know if a person can aim too high. I remember once back in the log church a lot of years ago brother from uh Port Elizabeth I believe it was Cape Town or Cape Town South Africa and he said I'm not going to die and you just feel a little hush go over the congregation and he stopped he said don't you know don't don't do that you know don't don't uh discredit my faith you know if I want to believe that. Well, then the people caught themselves and I think said quite an affirmative amen. If if he could lay hold of that, we say God bless him. &gt;&gt; And I think we ought to be able to lay hold of things that are high goals. Now we began to speak or we were speaking this morning and we got to that part of um the potentials that are within us. Uh now I spoke on and closed on the potentials we have for for unity. I'm going to take about two or three others, but I would like to just go back and speak about uh the body of Christ and some scriptures that we have concerning the body of Christ. Uh Paul said in Corinthians, the cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ and the bread which we break? Is it not the communion of the body of Christ? And I feel I would really like to stress this point this evening, you know, as a as a beginning place and take you back to this morning's service. uh there are so many homes and so many workplaces that today I think we've become accustomed whether it be the school that the young people go to or the place of work where you brothers work sisters some of your sisters are working out in the workplace uh there are homes and families and I don't think I'm describing uh the homes that are here in the church, but it could be where we get so taken up uh timewise. We get taken up interest wise, our interests are different. And the husband, he's he he's taken up and consumed with his circle of responsibility and so on. And and uh the wife, she's doing her thing, and the children are each doing their thing, and everybody's kind of going their own way. and the house uh ends up being kind of a a mutual meeting place where we grab a bite to eat, sleep for a little while, and then we're we're going our own direction. Uh I don't think that is really now I realize that you know that's a part of our uh a part of our age and I'm going to comment on that for I'm going to take a part of this service about that just a little later on. But you know what I mean when they when I refer to a house just being a place where people go through their own little orbits and then are are out doing their own thing. And the church can be the same thing. You know, we have our own uh our own activities and we have our own little life and we have uh uh we become just a whole uh several hundred individuals and we rotate in our own little uh uh sphere and our place of interest and then you know we have a meeting place here. We come here and we have a certain formality. We sing some songs and have a special and and hear a sermon and whatever more and and then we shake hands and go home. uh uh it has to be more than that. And so the unity I was speaking about this morning is not merely unity of gathering in one building, smiling, shaking hands, rejoicing, clapping our hands and doing similar things. That is not the unity. The unity is is is is from this scripture and other scriptures which I will read. It is uh is it not the communion uh of the body of Christ? This is this is one body. We are members of one body. And this body is not something that is malfunctioning. It's a body that works together. It's a body that functions. It's a body that has the same life stream. The same lif stream that's in you is in me is in the next brother, the next sister. the same lif stream, the same interest. The body of Jesus was not divided in his thoughts. No this way, this way and you know all uh in in some confused state. The body of Christ, the body of Christ has one mind, one thought, one vision. And now it doesn't take away from our individuality. We are individuals and we, you know, we're not all put out through uh uh a same machine and and uh we we look different and we do things differently and we we accept that and we acknowledge that. But as far as our spiritual goals and our spiritual vision is concerned, there should be one unified objective I believe along that line. And then the scripture says also now you are the body of Christ and members in particular. It means in particular you have your own part but that part is not some individual part over here. That part is a unified with the rest of the body. That's why it says you are the body of Christ. And doesn't say you're members in particular alone. That would mean you could be you know going any direction. It says but we are the body of Christ and members in particular. We have a part of a unique part of that body of Christ. Then the scripture says also that Ephesians 4 and2 for the per that the ministry was given for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry and for the edifying of the body of Christ as pastors, teachers, evangelists, apostles, prophets, the five-fold ministry has been given for this. And then that is the structure that God has given. And then uh the word of the Lord comes to the prophet and then the ministry as servants of Christ pick that up and God speaks to them out of the out of the message that God has sent. And it doesn't mean that God doesn't speak to the individuals uh individual members. He does and it must be that way. But as far as leadership is concerned, God has a pattern for leadership. He can't have 500 leaders. He has we he has a structure. In fact, is there's a there's a place in your home as as husbands and wives that have you have a home, you have a family. Uh I'm not permitted to cross a boundary of the headship of a father in a home. I'm permitted to work with him but not permitted to uh to uh override that headship in the home. And when I was in uh uh in uh in Brazil just now, that was one of the major points that I started out with the ministers because it it was it's almost like it was a new thing to them. Uh and it was a surprise to them. And I said to the brothers, they're senior brothers and I'm older than they are. So right away they be feel, you know, subservient to myself or some of them do at least. And I said to the brethren, I am here under your leadership. And they just like, you got to be kidding. I said, that's the scripture. I said, "And the prophet, if he ever laid anything out, he laid out that the church is sovereign and the pastor is the head of that church." That's what he said. Now, we can wiggle around if we wanted to. And many people uh who have traveled from other countries down there, you know, they begin to kind of tell those brothers how they should do it and do this way and you're not doing that right and you should have this and you should have that and and try to restructure them and and make them more successful or make them like a church back in America or Canada or whatever more. I said, "Listen, Brother Brandham said furthermore that that the native person that is native to his own country, he knows best how to get the gospel to his own people than than someone else from a foreign land." And I I really drove that thing down. I said, "I am here to serve you in whatever capacity you want us to try to serve you, but we are here subject to your ministry." And every one of these pastors, every one of you are sovereign in your own church. You're sovereign in your own place. And that's the way God has ordained it. And furthermore, once they started to grasp that and once they began to believe that God began to bless the meeting, they they had they had a liberty. They had a they understood then they were being respected uh for their call. And you know a person has to respect uh what you are in Christ be husband wife whatever we are. And so now this body of Christ there's potentials that I'm speaking about the body of Christ the body of Christ has communion. Whether you have it isn't the point. The body of Christ has communion. We may not have developed that communion. We may not have entered into that closeness. we may not have entered into that the beauty of that harmony uh one with another. Uh there may be uh uh in a larger congregation like this and and I've seen many that are much much larger. I find it would be quite impossible. But I think that we should make an an attempt to be uh to be near to one another, to be close to one another, to at least exude the uh feeling that that we are people that are concerned. We are people that are compassionate. We are people. We're not just someone that come here and happen to sit across the church from you and and and and shake hands when we go and so on, but there there is a a closeness. There is a bond. And the bond is a bond of love. I'm going to come to that in a little bit later. But whether we experience it or not is not the point. The point is this body of Christ has the resource of communion within it. Communion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A real union. Communion. Amen. &gt;&gt; This this body has the resource of each member being regarded and respected as a unique and special feature in this body of Christ. I don't care whether it's the ear, the eye, the nose or whatever it is. We are members in particular. and whether we have looked upon that brother that sister or or whatever function is happening and you might you know it's not what happens here on the platform uh necessarily I I can tell you I am I am just amazed and I am so appreciative of every member and the part they play and who they are. You might say well I don't do anything. I'm not visible whatsoever. I can tell you that what whatever God has given you to contribute to the body and it it may be something that you think is so insignificant. But let me just tell you something that you might do. You might not do anything more than shake hands with some people, put your offering in the offering, your tithe, uh say an encouraging word, uh maybe make a phone call, tell somebody that you really appreciated them, that thing that you just said to me uh when I was going out of the church that really lifted me up. Uh it may be something so simple and so insignificant, but that may anchor may well anchor something in that other person's heart and that will never leave them till the time they die or the time they're raptured and it remains as an anchor, a simple little word, a simple little statement. I was working once and as a young man just got married, didn't have any children yet and working hard and trying to make a living and I I think I missed a Sunday service and uh a brother just said to me, in fact, it was old brother McGriff. He just said to me, he said, "Whatever you do, build your life around Jesus Christ." And that that that doesn't sound like a profound service, profound profound message, but I never forgot it. I never forgot it. I've been busy. I've been occupied. I've missed services. I've I've, you know, that's just been life. Uh there's been things I've times you sometime you're away from your family, whatever more. But I've always kept that in the back of my mind. Build my life around the Lord Jesus Christ. Make him the focus point. to make him the hub of the whole of the whole wheel. And now this body also this body has it is presently and even at this moment is being edified. This ministry has been given to the church for the edifying of the body. Now we may not make full use of it but my word and my counsel this evening is that every person we should be made aware that when we walk through those doors and sit in this seat that you should be aware this body by almighty God who created heavens and earth and has set the universe in its place and all of these galaxies and everything in its orbit. My God, you have actually you have actually uh created in such a marvelous way this body of Christ and you have brought edifying into this body. This body whether I'm aware of it or whether I'm half asleep is actually being edified right at this moment because he has said it will be edified. That resource is within the body of Christ and it will be edified. your body, you perhaps have something to eat this afternoon and your body without you knowing anything about it is is uh getting nourishment and it's being nutrients are flowing to your body. Your circulatory system uh is is uh dis dispersing with that the energy and everything else that God ordained in this natural life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I read a quote. I don't read them very often. I only find it in a couple of places where brother Brandham said that the body of Jesus Christ once was quite early, but he also said it in ' 64. And I read it this morning where he said the sickest body was the body of Jesus Christ. Now I I have heard ministers and I I don't really agree with it that they have made that as a major pillar of their ministry sort of thing that the body of Christ is the sickest body and it is all the rest. I don't really I don't go for that. I don't believe that. I believe the body of Christ is the most beautiful woman. The church of Jesus Christ, the bride of Jesus Christ is the most wonderful group. And wherever I have gone, whether it is Zimbabwe or Malawi or Congo or or or uh in Europe or down in South America or Central America or across the United States or Canada, wherever God has led me to be or over in Asia, wherever it is, they're all the same. You could put them right here or put you right over there and there just wouldn't be that much difference. And you'd just take one another and you'd hug one another and you'd feel the same movement, that same flow of the same spirit. It would be there because it is the same body. &gt;&gt; It has the same life. &gt;&gt; It has it's invigorated the same way. And they would get they would get uh enthused and excited and inspired about the same preaching. I can take the same message I preach right here and go down there to Brazil and they just get electrified over the same thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Its body enjoys the same kind of food. &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. We have the same kind of diet. &gt;&gt; You'd fall very quiet if I started with some ava Marie Mary or whatever it is, Mary, mother of God, and some of those statements and brought up some rosary and everything. I think that you'd get very deflated pretty quick. You'd say, "What in the world is going on now?" You just say, "This isn't our diet." &gt;&gt; But this resource is in the body. Nevertheless, it uh you can be perfectly healthy, but you need to uh you need to do some things. Now, help me now. You need to do something. Don't go quiet. In other words, you need to do some things. And as you get older and as the message gets older, you need certain exercises and you need certain, you know, body movements that maybe you didn't have when you were young and the message was young and you didn't have any troubles and you didn't have anything to deal with and oh my, it was just all all uh you know fire and thunder and in you're so invigorated and go out in the street and witness and all the rest of it and Oh, just rejoicing. Threw the clock away. Meetings went on for hours. There was there was no meeting. They just started and went on and on and finally everybody went home. That's the way it was. And oh, we could say, "Oh, look at that denomination, all the rest of it." And brother Brandham, he he even said that, you know, the the what they had in Catholicism after a while, they found the same things coming into into Lutheranism. And after when Wesley came, then they found the same things that were in Lutheranism creeping into Wesleyanism. &gt;&gt; And then came Pentecost. And after Pentecost was young and fresh and, you know, full of fire and then pretty soon as it got older, then they found the same things that were in the Wesleyan movement and it coming into there. And now we out of Pentecost, we've gone moved on into bride age. And when we were young and fresh and didn't have all kinds of, you know, there was none of these difficulties or things to be concerned about. But as time went on, you find the same things, you know, moving in, creeping in, all the rest of it. So what do you need? You need to be edified. You need the body needs what God has put in it. And the resource is here. &gt;&gt; The resource is here. God has placed the resources. the body of Jesus Christ is being edified. But sometime now as you get a little older and I realize my goodness, it's hard to, you know, watch uh uh the breath and the weight and and all the other things that go with it and the movements. Goodness, why is that shoulder hurting? and get up out of bed in the morning, you know, and you just don't straighten up as fast as you used to. I've seen some of you a whole lot younger than me and you're having trouble, but you know what it's like. And so you find you have to start doing things in the body of Christ. Oh, well, we didn't have to do that, you know, back there, but now there are certain exercises that we need to have. And maybe back there, oh, the communion was so sweet. It was so instantaneous. There were just nothing. We just were one little unit, you know, and maybe you remember back in some place that you wear and it's just a little home group and whatever more, which is perfectly fine. But I've been in home groups that had more detention in them than we have here. &gt;&gt; Been at each other's neck. My goodness. So, we need to be edified and we need to work at having communion, &gt;&gt; not communion, but as as the Lord's table, but you need to work at it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Those of you that are married, you need to work at it. They say marriages are made in heaven but God left a whole lot of work on earth to be done in them. And brother Brandham says in this what shall I do with Jesus? He says right before us and this has been used for healing so much. Right before us we see the image of a perfect healed person by faith. And then we just make step by step till you step right into that person and just walk right on with it. There you are. That's what it take. That's what does it. Your faith, not your feelings. Your faith does it. But thanks. But thanks and praise be to God. Now, you might think this is uh stretching that a wee bit, but I don't think it is at all. You put before you what you think the body of Jesus Christ is. That perfect, harmonious, magnificent body of Jesus Christ. A body of power, a body of single thought, a body of single vision. one that operated like it was here on earth when Jesus Christ moved here. Although he was a man that was didn't have any beauty that we should desire him, yet I believe that his movements must have been with the most glorious grace. And brother Brandham said at the pool of Bethesda, he probably stepped over people that were sick and afflicted and invalid. And there he was. But he already had had the vision. He knew exactly where he was going. To me, that's the glorious grace. The body of Christ isn't some confused person today. The body of Christ isn't some uh uh I isn't a unit around the world that is uh scattered helter and skelter and doesn't know what it's doing. I find it uh very very marvelous under the opaces of the Holy Spirit. And when I speak of the the Congo or I speak of Brazil or I go to Brazil and speak of Cloverdale and speak of what God is doing in various places, it is it is to me it is absolutely marvelous. &gt;&gt; And I say to our God, how marvelous it is, how glorious that you redeemed a people out of this cesspool of iniquity and have brought a pure body bride of Jesus Christ. How wonderful. What a master plan that you came and descended into Satan's Eden and and brought a virtuous bride out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said the the the the serpent went to Eve's head and took her reasoning. God came to a virgin and took her womb. Jesus Christ came in this time, didn't appeal to her head, but came to the womb &gt;&gt; of the virgin bride and pregnantated her with a pure thus sayaith the Lord. That's already happened. And she is, I tell you, a purchased a purchased body of people, a glorious church without spot or wrinkle, whether you see it or don't see it, but that's what the word of God has said. &gt;&gt; And so I think we should as a as a group of people, I would like to encourage and all those who may be listening and streaming. I I went home. I don't even know how the people got to the computer in time. Got home already. email from Finland and another email from United States regarding the service this morning and the people were just blessed by it and and a sister in Finland interpret it for her brother. I'm sorry for her husband and pro maybe wouldn't be listening now but be getting in the middle of the night there but if they hear the service she'll certainly know I'm speaking her husband as she interpreted the message he said well then unforgiveness would be like a blood clot it would be stopping the blood from flowing to the part of the body and it wouldn't be getting the healing that it needs and she said that's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm glad for what people were getting from it. But what we need to do is we view this body of Christ and however you relate to it, whether you feel deficient or whether you feel lacking or I don't know how you feel or you feel overjoyed and and uh uh uh uh just uh uh important part of it or uh really connected. But nevertheless, I think we we all need to see this body of Christ and walk towards it &gt;&gt; and walk into it. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I have had I've had some little thing, you know, it's caused a fragmentation of my closeness with somebody else." Then I think you need need to stop looking at that person. You need to look at this body of Christ. Say, "This body of Christ has perfect communion. This body of Christ is absolutely a unified body. this body of Christ walks in and works in one unit. &gt;&gt; And I walk into that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe God would bless that. He said in uh one in a million, he said, "I'd give my entire life for this cause. And may I say this with sincerity? If I had 10,000 lives, I'd never change my opinion. Now he said, "Now healing is in the reach of every person." Remember, healing is in you. Talking about healing. I'm talking about healing in the body of Jesus Christ. There is healing. You think that God would put healing in our physical body and not put healing in the body of Christ? I tell you, there is healing in the body of Christ. And you might be a cell that will heal another cell. You might be one that is lifted up and needs to lift another one up and minister to another part of the body of Christ. Not just, you know, not just to have a little circulation here and then go on out, but that we actually are ministering to one another. And then he went on to say, God placed in the peach tree every peach that would ever be in it. Then he planted it in the garden. He said the peach tree or the apple tree or the fruit tree just has to grow from drinking the water in the earth. Now each one of you has those potentials in you to deliver you. &gt;&gt; Each one of you &gt;&gt; have in you the potentials the potentials perhaps has not become actual yet but you have the potential to deliver you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say praise be to quad. &gt;&gt; We may need to develop it. We may need to develop it further. Might be something that has been idled for a while. Needs to be uh started up again. So, well, I used to do that. I actually used to read my Bible. I actually used to take time to hear a message. I actually used to, you know, participate in some. But I've been too busy. Well, we're going to get to that, too. So, we've talked about the potentials of unity this morning, and so I won't go any further on that, but what ties in with the potentials of unity is the potential for, and I I think I'm aiming high for divine love. We can say it, we can speak about it, but I'm talking about an active divine capstone love. Love can look at a lot of bad things and look beyond it. &gt;&gt; Tell you what, if you've ever, you know, been standing where I stand, you've had family or have children or have those that are near to you or relatives and we all do. Often you have to look beyond a lot of things and see see what love sees. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; that black woman that had a boy that was dying from a social disease, from an immoral life, she looked way beyond his sin. She looked beyond his disease. She looked beyond death that was claiming him and patted his ared his face and said, "Mama's little boy." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that kind of love she, I tell you, she mined. She developed the resource of love that pulled an airplane with Elijah on it out of the sky. &gt;&gt; That kind of love. And brother Brandon looked at me, Brother John, he said, "Brother Eddie," he said, "what brought that airplane down? What caused that snowstorm?" &gt;&gt; And I didn't say anything. I didn't know what to say. He said, "That woman's love for her son." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. just a black mother, a black woman living in a poor part of the city. But her love was strong enough to change the elements of the sky and bring a snowstorm and bring a pilot and a plane down &gt;&gt; and bring a minister by her way, a prophet right by her gate. I tell you, there's one happy woman. &gt;&gt; And that God will honor faith wherever he finds it. Because I want to tell you something this evening. This that I'm speaking about divine love is a law of love. &gt;&gt; I say to you tonight, it's the law. &gt;&gt; It is the law. &gt;&gt; And that resource is within the believer. &gt;&gt; It is so strong in surging through me right now. Whether you see it in life or don't see it in life, God is not a man that he can he can lie. He made a promise. And if you claim that promise, he's not going to look you in the face and say, "I couldn't keep it." &gt;&gt; He's going to keep that. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, it's impossible." Nothing is impossible with God. &gt;&gt; Say, "That's aiming high. What's wrong with it? What's wrong with it? Can we aim too high? &gt;&gt; I say aim high. &gt;&gt; Whether we even see it in life &gt;&gt; or we don't see it, &gt;&gt; that's irrelevant. We believe it. &gt;&gt; We believe it. &gt;&gt; God who could take Abraham when his body was dead and Sarah's womb that was already dead and the milk veins. Is this your God? &gt;&gt; Is this your God? God that can change their very mortal lif stream and bring her back to conception. And you think somebody is beyond salvation or redemption? Not by my God standards. God is waiting for us to tap in to the resource that's within us now. &gt;&gt; And it won't function. It won't operate simply by well I go to Cloverdale Bible. That doesn't mean anything. Uh we got good preacher. That doesn't mean a thing. We got good singers. We got good musicians. We got wonderful deacons and all the rest of it. That doesn't mean anything. You You can have all of that. But it's the word. It's the word. Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. And if you believe that word, then nothing is impossible with this God. That's a divine love. Brother Brandham said in the questions and answers in 54, he said, "I'll give you my estimation of what I think that the closest thing to an evidence that a man is a Christian than anything I know of." Now, if you're interested in his estimation, let your ears be perked up. You know what it is? It's travail of soul. A person that is so hungering and thirsting for God day and night that they just can't stand it. &gt;&gt; And they got to do something for God. And they're full of love. And they're just a soul travail. Just travailing all the time. The Bible said, "He that goeth forth seowing in tears will doubtless return again, rejoicing, bringing with him precious sheav." This resource of perfect love in uh in the message explaining healing and and the raising of Gyrus's daughter, I guess it is in Gyrus. Anyways uh talks about the law it's simple the law of electricity he said if you work according to the law of electricity said if you then he said if you have an artisian well you can have an artisian well on one side of a hill putting out thousands of gallons of water per minute and on the other side of the hill you've got a crop burning up and it's needing that water. He said, "Well, now he said, if God is here in this building right now," and he asked the people if they believe it. Said, "You could shout, you could pray, you could do all of the things that you wanted to, and that water still wouldn't get from that artisian well to the other burning crop. But if you just used the law of gravity, you could get that water to that burning to to that burning crop on the other side of the hill. And then he he came right down. He said, "Now, if God is in this building now, here you might think if brother Brandon was here, it' all be different. It wouldn't be a bit different. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't be one bit different. You might get more excited. You might have more expectation. And I suppose that you would, but it wouldn't. You still would have to operate faith. You could come right before him right here. He could reveal the secret of your heart, but you'd still have to believe it. He's talked to a woman and he said and he reveals the tells her the very secret of her heart. He says she's missing it. &gt;&gt; And many that got it got their physical uh prayer answered never got a spiritual revelation. But he said now the only thing that you can do is work according to the law of God for our healing. He said is that right? And what is the law of God? What is the law of God? Coverdale Bible way said his love perfect love that casts out all fear. Love and faith is the same thing. love, perfect love, cast out all fear. I believe that that goes hand in hand with unity. The reason I hesitate there because I was thinking they're wondering if I should say something or not. But you know, I I may be uh a little bit strange, but I have a little problem with this phrase because it's so loose. I love you. I have a problem with that because I feel before I say that, I really need to weigh out what it is that I'm saying and the depths of those words because they happen to have they happen to carry a huge responsibility. &gt;&gt; If I love you, that means that regardless of what you may do, I'm going to hang on to you. I'm going to hold you fast. I'm going to believe in you. I'm going to be one with you for your benefit, for your best. And even though you may go off uh into some distant place or whatever more, love is strong enough to change the circumstances &gt;&gt; and bring people around. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it's not your love. It's his love just flowing through you. You're only the vessel. It's not your love, it's his love. &gt;&gt; Paul said to Timothy, "Let no man despise thy youth, but be thou an an example." And I would like, I don't think we're aiming too high. If I say to this church, I would like this church to be an example. You may say, "Well, it already is. I'm happy if it is, but I would like to be a better and a brighter example with a higher standard with a and when I talk about higher standard, I'm not talking about dress code necessarily. I'm talking about a spiritual standard where we see the manifestation of God amongst the people and where people become in visit and say, "What love they have the brethren one for another. What a body of people." and that it might might ripple out and others may hear it. What a diverse congregation. People from many nations, but they love one another. They respect one another. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is this too high to aim? I think not. I think that resource lays right here tonight in these seats. &gt;&gt; That resource to be a greater example. I believe that we would benefit the body of Christ. They could hear perhaps from other places, other cities, other churches, other places. Maybe they have other kind of difficulty and they could look and say, "Well, there's a beacon light that's shining." &gt;&gt; What a tragedy it would be. What a tragedy it'd be if we say, "Well, you know, we've we've had uh just spiritual dilemma and all kinds of difficulty." And uh we're not immune to that. I'm talking real plain. We could have that's easy to have &gt;&gt; say, well, we got warfare or war taking place amongst the members and the deacons fight and they can't agree with the trustees and the pastors this and other ministers of that and war and dispute taking place and open open argument happening and so on. Wouldn't wouldn't that be a discouragement to you? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be tragic? Wouldn't that be terrible? That's the other side of the coin. And yet on the other hand, we don't want to become just so uh we become professional at hiding our feelings. You know, they used to have a little cartoon and somebody would be doing something and shaking hands or giving a compliment to somebody. But out here was another little cloud that said what they were really thinking. Well, you look so lovely today. And they say, where'd they get that garment? Down in the garbage dump. You know, something like that. &gt;&gt; Say, oh, you know, so nice to have you. And the other guy is saying, how can I get out of here and &gt;&gt; get on my way? &gt;&gt; I'm looking at you. You all have that cloud. I've had that cloud a whole lot of times. And people actually pick it up. They can say, "I know you're busy. I know you got that is right. That's exactly right. Choosing the harder way. It's not easy. In fact, is I personally find it difficult. I'm sure Every human does finds it somewhat difficult to lay down our own hurts, our own feelings our own, you know, something that is uh it has touched you very very deep. It's hard to lay that down, you know, and this is not a counseling session and yet I think it is very very very needful instruction. In fact is I don't think there's instruction I could be preaching it. We need to and we need to practice that. We need to put it into practice now. &gt;&gt; We really do need to just lay those hurts down. Lay those things down and move on &gt;&gt; from that. Move on from that because those things have an they they they afflict us. They have an effect upon us as a body of people. It may not I'm not just speaking about people within the church. I'm talking about, you know, can be things outside. You you you that work in the workplace, you can get so afflicted from a workplace and you pack that home. you kids from school that are in in various schools, you can pick up such a spirit at school and then you pack it right home and upset the whole household. These spirits, &gt;&gt; they jump around. &gt;&gt; They sure do. And and the enemy is there just upset the whole house, bring distress, bring dissension, maybe get the mother going one side, the dad going the other side. Where'd it come from? maybe from some classroom. We got to be spiritual. &gt;&gt; And you know, if if it depends what frame of mind a person is in. I I've said here before people say, "Well, you know, I don't like this thing up here." Well, that's fine. Maybe I don't like it either. But what does that what's the difference? What has that got to do with what is happening &gt;&gt; in the communion of the body of Christ? It really has nothing. It's perishing. It's passing away. It has nothing to do with it. The color of the carpet or the color of the walls or whether it's what is this or what is, you know, whether it's cold or whether it's too hot. That's fine. We try to make it as comfortable and as good as possible. But on the other hand, our our message and our prophet talks about rugged people. You want to be happy you're not sitting on the concrete. want to be happy we're not suffering with some snow outside or some cold weather or some hot weather or humid weather or whatever more. We we we come here for communion. We come here to edify one another and we are what we are and we can't be anything else. Let's raise the standard higher and say we'll be a body of people that move in the spirit of God and we'll not allow Satan to have an opportunity. won't allow him to get a foothold in here because we believe in the law. The law of perfect love. We believe in that law. &gt;&gt; Law will drive you to risk your life. Love, the law of love will cause you to risk your life. Love will drive us to expend ourselves. people people say and I I'm not saying I can only speak personally on on some things but they'll say why you know why you go down there all that way for for one week and just back and you know wear yourself out and you know we need you at home and so on so forth. I realize all that but I can't tell you the things that I know that are needed. I I can't I can't speak that publicly. So many things you can't say and you just need to be there for them and need to give whatever you can give and you can't give something that you aren't and something that you don't have but you're there to give what you can give and and most times it isn't it is in money it's not finances it's not that they just they some say I want to shake the hand that took brother Brandham's I had a lot of them say that right here. I want to shake your hand. Brother came right up. I'm just sitting with almost wasted after an hour and a half or so. And he says, "Can I have your handkerchief?" I said, "It's all wet. It's all sweaty." I said, "I just want to have it." I don't know what it means to him. I've had him take it. Say, "Can I have your tie? Well, it's all wet. I'd like to have your tie. Can you give me your tie? I take my tie off and give it my tie. I have your handkerchief. I want to have it. Somebody took my handkerchief said I'm not ever going to wash this. You know, I don't think there isn't one one there isn't one ounce of virtue to that. But yet I want I I don't want to hesitate to say very quickly and we need this as a as a as a body of Christ. I know that that kind of respect for the ministry and the man of God is going to put them in good standing with God. And if we had that kind of respect one for another, I'm not asking for that, but for one for another, that when you look at another, you realize Jesus Christ in all of his suffering hung there for this person, for this young man, for this brother, for this sister. Jesus Christ loved them so much. God loved them so much. He sent Christ down from the glory of heaven to suffer and die for them. and I respect them. &gt;&gt; And they're doing their best. &gt;&gt; They're sincere. &gt;&gt; They're a member of the body of Christ. And that will set up a communion between you and them. And you'll begin to discover a new appreciation &gt;&gt; one for another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Love will cause you to expend yourself. Love will overcome offense. so that you will not be offended. I'm just going quickly because I want to come to this now before I close. I've been almost an hour now and I want to close in a little bit, but this is coming to one of the most important parts. I want you to think with me about the resource of time. Time. Satan has engineered things to rob us of our time. I believe it's highway robbery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's put a gun to our head and said, "You're going to do this and you're going to keep this schedule and you've got this much to do and this is going to keep demand your time." The scripture says Job 14 and5 seeing that his days are determined and the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass. Our days are determined and our months are with him. and he has appointed our bounds and we cannot pass that. And David said in Psalms, the days of our years are three score years and 10. And if by reason of strength they be four score years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow, for it is soon cut off and we fly away. Each one here has been given a deposit by God, a resource of so much time and those bounds are already set. You have so many days, weeks, months, and years. And God has given it to you and allowing you to determine pretty much how that is spent. And Satan has engineered things so that he would make it such so it would be uh just a an incredible struggle to have barely enough time to say a short prayer, to come to church or to have a little time for God. And I think that he has perpetrated a massive fraud upon the body of Christ. There's an article here says, "Ready, set? Let's slow down. This is just how the world is viewing things." But can you listen close? this person who wrote this had a near miss on the highway and almost had an accident. And so they said that this close call, you know, it caused them to think and they write heart disease because of the pressure of this age. Heart disease is our number one health problem followed by depression. Happiness has been on the decline for the past 40 years. Isn't that amazing? God calls a voice off the earth and happiness begins to deteriorate. I don't think there's a medical category for hurry sickness, but we're all carriers. We're all carriers of hurry sickness. Says, "Our incredible energy," and I'm just taking little excerpts, "Our incredible energy," speaking of the American people, this is out of the Seattle Times, I believe it is, "Our incredible energy has become obsessive, rushing, and maybe we're just galloping toward a cliff." said, "Could we learn something from Europe? Slow life. There's a movement over there, slow life." And there was a quite a joke over the fact that McDonald's, which is fast food, set up a place in Italy where they traditionally like to take a lot of time eating. And so they've called it slow food instead of fast food. And now there's around 6,000 places that have opened up and they call it slow food to encourage the people to take a little more time. Now just listen just a moment. They are saying this journalist has said but the most significant reason to slow down is time for relationships. Why? Because research shows that taking time for friends and family is the most important thing you can do for your physical and psychological well-being. This is just a world talking about human relationship. I'm talking about taking time for a spiritual relationship. You know when Jesus saidf follow me I will make you fishes of men and the Bible says also that there were others women that ministered to him and so on. So, it wasn't just the 12 disciples. There were many others that followed him. And I was just thinking as I pondered this subject, it takes time to follow the master. And follow also comes into being a disciple. And a disciple is essentially a follower. And in the in the Bible days, a master or a leader or uh uh one that was considered as a spiritual leader, he perhaps ride before his students and his students would follow him. They study and watch eagerly how he does things. And he is not just their master, but he is their example. And they intend to follow him. I I I I want to say that this congregation here. We do have some time. And I would like to lift the standard of how we use that time. We perhaps don't have to be as long as we need to be on the telephone. I saw an ad and there were a group of ladies and I think it I think it's just worth saying there a group of ladies and they were having a little lunchon together on a nice balcony just overlooking a beautiful little lake and you could see it was so serene and so lovely and so nice and they were enjoying one another's company and the cell phone went off one of the lady's cell phone. She reaches into her purse, takes out the cell phone, looks at it, and she just pits that thing like a hand grenade into the lake. And all the other women reached into their purse. They all grabbed their cell phone. They all pit their cell phones into the lake. I thought that was a good thing to do. We become slaves to those things. And some don't have one, they have two. And I've been with brothers that have three and can talk on two at once. I don't know what it is. I really don't. I'm a busy person. I have people I can be connected with all over the place. But you know, and I I shut that cell phone down and and and I get in the airplane and and the thing just barely touched the ground and you know, there's somebody on the phone, maybe some young girl or some fellow or some businessman, and I don't know, maybe it's a sense of power. I don't know what it is. You know, they get on the phone and I'm busy and I'm connected. You know, sometimes I wonder whether they're trying to tell me I actually got somebody to talk to. And sometimes I wonder if they're actually talking to anybody. Yeah, sell those shares. Oh, are we only going to make 400,000? Well, that's too bad. Anyway, sell them anyway. And the way it is. I got off the last plane. They're just all kinds of people on the cell phone. I I got a cell phone. I just shut the thing down. I didn't even open the thing up. I could have been talking to people and reading, but I just think there's, you know, when I go to dial somebody, even in the church, I think, how many calls have they got? Do they really need me? Do I really need to make this call to them right now? Sometime I think about that because I just think about, you know, their time. I'm getting more conscious of time. We've got a resource of time. I would like to raise the standard of what we do with our time in this church. you in your home, &gt;&gt; you young people, I don't care whether and I think you need to become very very regimented. Say, I am going to take more time for my relationship with Jesus Christ. I'm going to tell him. And I think we as a church need to take more time with our families and more time with one another and more time with brothers and sisters. Do you agree? &gt;&gt; Can I can I just carry on with this? &gt;&gt; You know, one of the things that they said is exactly what brother Brandham. Brother Brandham said that the streets would be full of neurotics and they are saying right here that the pressure of time on the people is turning them into that. He said uh they said well if they start going this way they they indicated uh uh won't that ruin the economy if everybody slows down? Won't that ruin the economy? He said what's the economy for? Isn't it to help create a happy healthy country? What good is a healthy economy if it's killing its citizens? Amen. &gt;&gt; It goes on to say and there's a gentleman by the name of Wybrow that had written an article or written a book and and she quotes him says Wybrow says that we are being pushed to the edge of our physiological and uh psychological uh limits. Uh we can't take much more. We need a new approach to both the economy and to our sense of well-being. We need to pay attention to all the subtle messages telling us to slow down. The feeling of being constantly irritable and ready to explode. The fear that we're always behind says those are some of the messages. And the world is that way. I have been irritable because of the pressure because of the time, you know, that that the the there just isn't enough time in the day &gt;&gt; to get things done. And I've just decided it's not worth it. &gt;&gt; God's given me so much time and I'm going to just I'm going to make sure that the world only gets what it what I have to give it. I'm going to have time for my relationship with Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; to be able to you have to do thing a lot of things. No, you don't have to do a lot of things, but you can sit there &gt;&gt; and you can speak with him and you can have some time. People say, "Well, God doesn't speak with me." Well, you take time for it. &gt;&gt; I think we need to have that time. I I I think it would be it would really be an insult if we're trying to build a relationship with somebody and some of the young couples that have, you know, gone through courtship and marriage and so on so forth and as a as a family, I hope I'm not being too plain and blunt, but it just, you know, to run in and say, "Well, dear, I only have five minutes. you know, let's uh uh you know, let's have our little intimate conversation right now and then I got to be off. I got to be going. It's not going to work. &gt;&gt; Just not going to work. We have to have time to merely be with one another and to sit with one another uh like we are here in church tonight. But we have to have time. I'm talking about our relationship with Christ. It takes time, folks. And brother Brandham talks about the 10 days that they were in the upper room. I think those 10 days did a lot of things. Brother Brandham even says Peter maybe said, "Oh, I think I got it." No, one day and two days and three days and they were all together and I I don't know what took place there, but they were but God allowed them to wait 10 days. And that was a I think an although we're not waiting 10 days, but it seems to me that it's an essential part of our relationship and allowing the Holy Spirit to uh to have his way in our hearts. Now, um my when I was with brother Brandham and I'm going to close in just a moment. When I was with him, I was just a young man and I tried to observe so I could grasp what made him what he was or what God saw in him and why as a prophet I was so intrigued with that ministry. I noticed that he had time. He had time to observe and he observed simple things. And I would try to pick up what not only what he observed but why he saw that. And when he saw this Indian man saw the big patches of gunny sacks on his pants and how he sat on the horse, how he sat so straight. I was observing and he was pointing that out to me and I was asking myself inside what is it in him that sees such a simple thing when he come in here if he came in here I can guarantee you you'd be shocked with what it was that he would observe he would observe the most simple thing the thing that you and I overlook that's what he observed and he told here in detail spent time in a service told how at times square in New York that he and Billy went there and they went there because they said they were going to tear this structure down. So, they went there to take some pictures. And you know the thing that he observed, he didn't talk about the grandeur of what it was they took pictures of. He looked around. He saw the people up above and where they were and they were rushing, going here, going there. He says to Billy, "Where are they all going? Where are they all going? Where are they hurrying to? And that's what caught his attention. And I actually think that, you know, that would be a good thing for us to say. Where am I rushing to? What am I hurrying off to? Have I taken time for the real important thing? You know something, friends? uh in this body if I could just express myself tonight in this body I believe that if you could take just what I've said now on this resource of time that we have you say well what would that do about yourself think what that do right here on the platform think what that do for the man of God who's ministering here think about what that would do for someone else who's observing you and then you would encourage someone else and someone else and the whole the whole atmosphere here of the entire congregation rises higher. You begin to see God start to do things spontaneously in the congregation and prayers answered and uh unbelieving and the backslider coming back to God and the supernatural happening. Why? Because God is so pleased to dwell in that kind of an atmosphere. I say, "Oh God, that's what we want. Is that aiming too high? No. I believe that's what God has in store for us. And that resource is here. I think it just means uh depends on what we do with that resource. It's a tremendous a tremendous thing. And with this, I'm going to close. I've observed something in the last short while. I want to be very very frank with you and this is probably coming out of left field but I want to express my burden and vision for the present time. I've observed and I mentioned it just a little bit this morning. I was just you you have to try to come into my mindset now. I was just in Brazil and the message came there in 1957 which there really was no message in but it was introduced and I met the grandson of the man who brought it there and I believe this grandson is is going to have some official position down there. not not with what we were doing, but um he told me and talked to me uh quite a little about how his grandfather brought the message there. But while he's speaking and while I'm speaking now, here's another brother, brother Vanderlay, whose church we were in and seeing this church and upstairs a huge kitchen and area to feed the people. 11,200 people in the congregation probably half again as many as we have here and qualified men something happened to me only only place ever happened in the world the head deacon I understand he's a head deacon and they likened him to Tony because he just moved around so quick and so on so I was done preaching I I I stepped back I was sitting there and he he saw that I wanted to maybe slip away. So, he comes and gets me and takes me back into the pastor's study. I mean, the pastor's study is old marble floor. It's beautiful study. And takes me to the pastor's study, and I'm going to go and sit down in the pastor's chair. Oh, no. Uh, no, no, no, no, no. He doesn't speak a word of English, and I certainly don't speak any Portuguese. No. And there's a doorway there, and in in this other little room right off the pastor's study is two twin beds, and off of that is an ensuite, a bathroom with a shower and all the rest of it. And uh so you know now he and and he rushes in there and he gets a hold of the pillow and fluffs the pillow and makes motion. He wants me to lay down. Oh no. I I've never gone from the pull pit to lay down like this in the pastor's study. Oh, no. I said, "No, you know, I want to wash my face." So I go into the washroom. He in there ahead of me and I start splashing some water in my face and washing my face and he already has a big bath towel off of the off the wall and my face is all wet and he's patting my face. I loved him. I said, "I've never had this happen in my life. Just let me suffer some more like this." and he passes it up and sets that towel up and now he's got a hold of me and he takes me right over to this bed that he was so determined he fluffed the fluffed it up and and so well I thought well I I'll sit here I can sit here I he had me sat down had both of my shoes pulled off before I could even say Jack Robinson and swung my feet up on the bed and laid me down and I thought well this does feel pretty Guess what? I felt called to Brazil and I thought I I looked at these people and that's the kind of deacons they have. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I thought, you know, it is uh so rich in its culture and its character and its natural resources and the its modern and fine buildings and fine congregation. And I felt so sad. They have probably less than a hundred messages available to them. And as I was preaching, I I I just took three words, three words. It was so powerful statement of brother Brandham and I I had said that's three words out of one paragraph. It's just they just exploded. They just were electrified. I said, "That's just three words out of one paragraph." And perhaps you haven't you haven't even got that book. But Satan works so hard for them not to lay down little feelings, little hurts, and he just will nurture that, fertilize that, keep that thing going. So just go on year after year after year. And it's amazing how our mind says, "Well, you know, listen, this is I had people rattle things. When did this happen to me?" Well, that was about 12 12 years ago and you're still packing that thing. 15 years ago and you're still packing that thing. But we are poor humans. We do that and the devil just loves it. He just go for it. Yeah. You know, they treated you wrong and that's the way it is. I tell you what a miserable situation to live in. God deliver us. &gt;&gt; Deliver us from that kind of thing. And it has hindered the message. And while I thought of that, probably got less than a hundred messages. I mean, really qualified messages. And I I I I so I told them, "God bless brother Timothy, brother Murphy, the brothers I've got down here, China, Vietnam, Ukraine, and now Brazil in just the last five or six years." And you heard about China this morning. Say, "What is this burden? What is my burden?" My burden and vision is to work with pastors and men of God and to see that the message gets into as many languages and get spread as far a field as it possible in the shortest possible time. That's my burden. My burden is to go into a place and evaluate what is the true need in the country. If God opens a country or opens the hearts of the people, my burden is if requested to provide counsel to men of God who have the vision for their people. My burden is to advise and to make the most efficient and economically sound and effective way to get the message and increased quantities to the nations of the people. My burden is if if necessary to offer direct assistance to the brothers to ensure that the bride of Jesus Christ is is serviced with the with the cry and the message that she so desires. My burden is to see something that is being blessed of God and where his holy presence is welcome. My burden is to make use of the most advanced technology for the purpose of getting the gospel of Jesus Christ in the light of this message to the world. And my burden is that this will require every ounce of spiritual strength and resource that we can muster. But that is my desire. Brother Brandham said in deep callth the deep. He said, "No, in the prayer line," he said, "if he rebukes you." He said, "It'll be the truth. If it's you must be willing to stand it in the audience anywhere, if he says you must know it's not me, it's him." And go make it right. The first thing you can do before you can find a a cure, you've got to find the cause before you can find the cure. And so I'm sorry I've been a little bit long, but I got this message from the burden that came on my heart when I was in this country. And you I you can't look at a nation of 180 million people and see these churches and see these people and see these believers and see such wonderful deacons as I just described to you and fine godly men of God as pastors and see them and and and the thing that was so uh uh I was unable to grasp it was I was just incapable of grasping and as the first time I encountered it that they were content with what they had because it just seemed as though it wasn't going to come to them that they weren't going to really get it and they they didn't really have they wondered it was like too good a thing to believe that we were going to stand by them and that's why brother Tony stayed there he didn't want to stay there he'd love to be here he'd love to be with his wife love to be in this church tonight he didn't want to stay there, but he's going from brother to brother and church and it's a huge nation and seeking and letting them know we are here, brethren. We will stand with you. We we will put whatever resources we can and you as a church, you're the people that are supporting with prayer and with giving and whatever more. and friends because our time is limited because we only have a small resource of time. I say to this congregation, I trust that you see what my burden and my vision is. And and and I believe that you'll understand if I say this. God has raised I'm going to say it plain. God has raised up this place and is going to need is going to need the full effect of every member of the bride of Jesus Christ. I'm not talking about finances. I finances is is down the ladder as far as I'm concerned, but a body that moves together. A body that's in harmony. A body that exercises the law of love and unity and striving endeavoring for the unity of the faith. a body where the Holy Spirit is so pleased and we come together and it's electric. It's just electrifying what God has done. I wouldn't want to be accountable for having held back the spirit of God in a meeting when there's people crying out, "Oh God, come amongst us. Move mightily. Don't let anything hinder you." Hear the God of creation come amongst us. Does the people say, "Amen." Glory to God. That's what your desire is. I believe if we move in that direction, even that some that may not be as committed as as others at this moment, but I believe we'll be a force. It'll be a powerful force. And it will move others. It'll move others. It'll move those that are slower, but they will see that someone has taken a real stand, a real step. And now we're going to use these resources that God has given us. The strength that we have, what one person can't do, we'll do as a unit. &gt;&gt; We'll do together. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When we come together in the house of God and whoever it is stand behind the pulpit, he knows he has the support of the people. He knows they've been in prayer. He knows they've had a personal relationship and they have been talking to Christ. No wonder he'll come down and anoint us. Hallelujah. I'm taking a little extra time, friends, but this thing is burning on my soul. That God has raised up this place. He's raised up this place to be a testimony. And I see that the nations that God has allowed us to to to work in and to function in the brethren that God has given and all we are is assisting them. I think of the Philippines and what is happening there. I tell you what, that office that's in the Philippines, that's not just an office. That's a work of God. &gt;&gt; Everything. I tell you what, even believers so-called have worked against that and have I've gotten long long pages like that of of of ministers names who said we don't accept the books that come. They think we're printing books. We don't print books. It's the pastors over there print the books and the people over here in America just pay pay to have them printed. But they they've raised up and one of the first scriptures I read to the brothers in in Brazil was and a great door and effectual is opened unto me. Paul said and conjunction word there are many adversaries. And I said to the pastors as soon as you start to try to do something good for God evil will be right there. You'll try to do something and amazing it's not from without. Many times it's from within. Number one, lack of support, not financial support. Being right behind the vision, not being able to not be able to commit themselves and say, "Brother Ed, Brother Biscll, whoever, whatever you've called me, you say, I see what's happening, Brother Tony, Brother Ernie, I see what's happening, and I may maybe I'm not very vocal. Maybe I'm not upfront. Maybe I'm not very visible. I want you to know I'm behind it because I see what's happening." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's all we need. &gt;&gt; And then we'll do whatever God allows us to do. &gt;&gt; And when you have, brethren, here I'm kind of standing in the middle. I'm coming here conveying to you the burden, the burden, not of one or two men, the burden of maybe two, 300 ministers in Brazil saying, "Don't leave us. &gt;&gt; Don't leave us. &gt;&gt; Help us put this together. We don't know how to do it. We don't have the wisdom. We've never done it. We don't know. We don't have the experience. Stay with us. &gt;&gt; I say to the congregation, are you willing to stay with them? &gt;&gt; Willing to stay with them? &gt;&gt; Willing to support them? &gt;&gt; You willing to say, "Do what you can, brother Ed. Do what you can, Brother Tony." Pray for Brother Tony tonight. We're with you. That's what we need. Thank you. God bless you. And through that then we're able to express to these brethren, brother Netto, brother uh Vanderlay, some of these brethren, they just those two I've just mentioned there at least 3,000 believers as they were here you'd love them &gt;&gt; and as soon as you'd embrace them you'd say I got 1100 messages they got 100. That's what I feel. I take those brothers, those pastors by the neck and shake their hand and say he he's maybe got 70 and I got,00 and I'm going to walk out of here feeling great. I feel heartbroken. I come home and think that they're play politics with this message. Say you can't get it out. You can't I tell you there isn't any power in heaven or hell that's going to stop when this word from getting out. going to get it to those people. And I believe we need to we need to support that kind of thing &gt;&gt; in the Ukraine. In the Ukraine and I close, I promise in the Ukraine there the first time and all 70 ministers, some from Armenia. I said Armenia, my goodness, from Usbekistsan. Is it pastors I never thought I'd ever see. You mean the message got there? Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, how wonderful. He said, "Can you help us? Can we get books?" I I I don't know what the what's happening with the books. We didn't go there for that. I said, "Do you have books? Do you have message books?" And and the first brother said, "I I've only gotten the last book I got is in Russian. The last book I got was two and a half years ago." And this brother says, "The last one I got was about three years ago." and uh and a great door and actor was open. But there are many adversaries and if we stop because there's an adversary but we keep pursuing. Hallelujah. We keep pushing many difficulties but you don't give up. &gt;&gt; We don't give up. &gt;&gt; The body of Jesus Christ doesn't know to give up. Even when Jesus was weary, he didn't quit. When we're weary, we don't quit. &gt;&gt; He was tired, but he had compassion on the people. And this body of Christ hasn't changed. We get weary, but we don't give up. &gt;&gt; And we still have compassion. &gt;&gt; And we expand ourselves as a as a bride, a body of Christ. I see what happens in the church. I see an event like yesterday. I see the sisters. I see your labor. I see what you do. I say, "God bless you." I take people through the school. I tell you what, you teachers and you that are involved there, I say it, it's not just school workers on the wall. It's love hangs on the wall. &gt;&gt; And people come through and they say that. And today they're getting two messages a month in the Ukraine. Two a month. Last one I saw was it said two and a half years and one says three years. Two a month. I ask you as a congregation, does that deserve just a prayer? Does that deserve our united heart, a a feeling from our soul and our spirit and say, "God bless every brother that has any hand in doing that." And may they know that we are here to support them in prayer in whatever way that we can. Ah, if they see or the streaming of the video, they'll see my hand up. They'll see the glory of God on my face. They'll see me sitting in my seat in my place. I've gone over there. You'd be surprised. They say, "Who's that brother? Who's that sister? I notice they're not there now. Where are they?" I said, "Well, they're sitting on the other side of the church." Oh, then they feel better. They thought they weren't there anymore. And my wife says, "They keep better track of our people than we do. It's amazing because they live with it." Well, to God be the glory. Great things that he's done. and let you know we'll be as faithful and as burdened servants as we possibly can be. And I let the devil know tonight that there is absolutely no adversary. There is no weapon that he can form that's going to stop this message, going to stop this bride. And to me, it's a beautiful, spotless bride, virtuous, married to the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what I think about this bride. That's what I think about her. I say, "God bless you." We've got a couple that are going to be baptized. I wonder if we could just stand and sing while they go to be uh get ready to be baptized. Forgive me for being a little bit long, but I think that we have sufficient time to me unbburden myself. I'd like to just sing to God be the glory. Great things he's done. Brother Rod, maybe you could uh help us lead in that. [Music] He the world that he gave us his son to yielded his life and I to sin and open the floodgate that all may go in. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Let the earth hear his voice. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Let the people rejoice. Oh come to the father through Jesus the son and give him the glory. Great things he have done.

Very appropriate song for he had done great things. Tonight we have two of our our young people being baptized. Jamina Waldner, Brother Michael, Sister Helen's daughter. I was thinking Mike 30 some odd years ago as Mike heard the voice of God and actually almost lived in a car and I was blessed to have him come and live in my apartment. I was a single man and I always I had the three-month plan. The three-month plan is you live with me three months, you better have a job and out you go and spread your wings. We had some great times of fellowship. Brother Mike, great man who loves the word of God. And we're blessed here, Jamina, to have you here, a daughter standing. The scripture says this in in 1 Samuel and three, it says, "An heir the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep that the Lord called Samuel and he answered," Here am I. We have brother Timothy Andy's also to be baptized. We have Jamina Waldner that's standing in the waters of baptism. And the wonderful thing about each one of their testimony is that each one has heard the voice of God. That is a tremendous thing. And I believe it's so tremendous because the same voice that spoke to Samuel is the same voice that spoke to them to go on with God. The Bible goes on to say in in John chapter 5, verily verily I say unto thee, the time is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of God. So I believe it's very important that a person hears this voice. And Jamina, you've heard it as a young girl. Just a few years ago, God dealt with her to surrender her life to Christ, to walk on, give herself to the Lord. And you know, as time goes on, sometimes it just gets a little bit distant. Little bit distant. But the Lord is faithful. The Lord is very faithful. And sister Jimmy is very quick to say, "I've heard the voice of God again, and I want to be obedient to the voice." You know, there's a lot of people that hear voices. Brother Ram said, "There's many voices today. That's to deaden the voice of the supernatural." A lot of people hear the voice and they might even hear the message and they might even uh maybe say, you know, God's dealing with me. But it's another thing to respond &gt;&gt; to the voice. &gt;&gt; And Sister Jamina, that's what I want you to understand now. Not Not only did God speak to you, but now you've responded to him. You were pricricked in your heart just as they were in the book of Acts. They heard the word and were pricricked. Peter said, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." This baptism is not the end all. The baptism of fire, that's when a son and daughter is birthed by the word of God. Sister Jamina, may God grant to you your desires for the things of God. Let's pray. Father, I believe you've ordained this time that Jamina is standing in the waters tonight. Lord, something has tugged at her heart. She's responded. She said, "Yes, Lord. Yes to your will and to your way." And Father, she's responded desired to be filled with God. She's repented. She has given her life to you. And now, Lord Jesus, she wants and desires to be identified not only in your death, Lord, but in your resurrection. So, I'm praying, God, you fill her with the Holy Ghost. Make her such an example and a light of your glory. Lord, may the spirit of God and a spirit of meekness and grace be her portion. And may God, you ever lead her faithfully is our prayer. I commit her now your divine care in Jesus name. Sister Jamina, by your confession &gt;&gt; that Jesus Christ is your personal savior. I baptize you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want that kind of blessing. I want I want I want I want that kind of blessing that saves and keeps and satisfies the soul. I want I want that full salvation to build of heaven for me. Oh, I want I want I want the kind of blessing that saves me and keeps me and satisfies my soul. I want Yes, I want that full salvation till of heaven's glory. [Music] Come on here, brother Timothy. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We've got a real jewel standing here tonight. Timothy Andes, God has spoken sovereignly. Spoken sovereignly, too. And that's what you always look for. You know, so often as I told both Jamina and Tim, different ones come into the office and many are even here yet now and they've come and we've talked to them and dealt with them in the scriptures and just come and say, "Well, I feel I need to be baptized, but it's because of my friend or because of this or because of that." And we just felt, well, we'll just hold on. But when it's of God, it's a marvelous thing. I've never hurried for one. I've taken the time from going from the scriptures. We sit down, we cover it. We want them to know that this is the most important event for them. &gt;&gt; It is because the scripture says, "Saints of God, repent." That's that's the word of God. And be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins. And you know, there's people that come here often that don't do that. The Bible says to him, "You shall be filled with the Holy Ghost." And that is a desire of every son and daughter of God is be filled of God and be used of God, whatever God has. And I've watched Brother Tim over the last few meetings and and God's dealt with you, Tim, hasn't he over the last few months. And the marvelous thing about this and this is a marvelous marvelous thing. Brother John was away in meetings and brother Timothy is here in the house of God and brother John calls me up and he says I believe if you just be tender I believe the Lord's dealing with Timothy. I say that's right. I believe he is too. And sure enough Tim doesn't know of our conversation and God confirms the word and I say that is a great thing. It's a great thing. And Tim has come on his own desire. Maybe you'd like to give a testimony, Tim. &gt;&gt; I just want to say thank you to the Lord for letting me be here. And I just want to thank him for all the things he's done in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, let's pray. &gt;&gt; Lord, I I see a young man that has responded to the beckoning of the I pray God that you will ever keep your hand upon his life. And Father, that he could be an example to other children that would be around him. Lord, give him such a love for the word of God. Lord, that same one that spoke to Samuel, may you continue to speak to him on a daily basis, Lord, in his little prayer closet as he shuts himself away at night, Lord, to read your word. May he become a soldier of the faith. May you anoint him in a young age, Lord God, to hold the banner of your word up high. Father, we just commit him now to you in Jesus name. And brother Timothy, by your confession that Jesus Christ is your savior, I baptize you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
