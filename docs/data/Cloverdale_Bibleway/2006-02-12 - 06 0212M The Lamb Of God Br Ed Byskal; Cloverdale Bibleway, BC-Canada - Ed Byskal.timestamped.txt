[15:44] &gt;&gt; We're going to go to prayer at this
[15:45] time, but before we do, I'd like to sing
[15:46] just the chorus. I know the master of
[15:48] the wind. Number 25 44. Aren't you glad
[15:51] you know him this morning?
[15:53] &gt;&gt; He's here to meet our needs. Hallelujah.
[15:58] I know the master of the way.
[16:06] I know the maker of the rain.
[16:13] Oh, he can calm the soul and make the
[16:18] sun to shine again.
[16:23] I know the master of the way. Sing it
[16:27] one more time.
[16:30] Yes, I know the master of the way.
[16:38] Oh, I know
[16:42] the rain.
[16:47] He can all make the sun to shine again.
[16:54] Oh, I know the master of the way.
[17:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to go to prayer at
[17:03] this time. And we ask brother Tony,
[17:06] brother Tony, if you'd come and take
[17:09] these prayer requests for the Lord. I'm
[17:11] going to actually, brother Tony, leave
[17:13] two for you. I just can't pronounce
[17:14] their names. They're overseas, so I'll
[17:15] have you make mention of them. Uh we
[17:18] want to remember brother uh Dave Sanger,
[17:22] pastor in
[17:24] down Philadelphia. He's uh gone to the
[17:26] for emergency surgery this past week and
[17:29] had to be uh remitted to the hospital
[17:31] for complications.
[17:34] Just pray that God's grace will be with
[17:36] him in the second operation.
[17:39] I also Elizabeth Neighbor has a request
[17:41] here. We want to remember uh
[17:44] Joshua Stany who is uh who has ruptured
[17:47] his appendix in Louisiana and pray for
[17:50] the infection, the healing, the fever
[17:52] would be reduced. Apparently, he's been
[17:55] in the hospital for several days.
[17:59] Sister
[18:00] Norma Smith has a testimony here. On
[18:03] Tuesday, I had a stent put in my main
[18:06] artery in my neck. Praise the Lord.
[18:08] Everything went well. Thank you all for
[18:10] your prayers.
[18:12] And uh, Brother Mike Gier
[18:16] has a prayer request here for his boss's
[18:17] son, Jason, who is in a medicalinduced
[18:20] coma, very critical condition. Uh
[18:23] they're just asking prayer for his lungs
[18:25] to clear and that God will use this time
[18:27] to deal with the parents.
[18:30] We want to pray for uh Doris Hayes
[18:33] wanting to be here but having to stay
[18:35] home due to a cold and lung condition.
[18:39] And uh we want to remember please pray
[18:41] for Ron West as he's going in for heart
[18:44] surgery Victoria on Wednesday. I do have
[18:47] one testimony
[18:49] testimony of healing from China. A
[18:52] brother was diagnosed with liver cancer
[18:54] one year ago and testified how the Lord
[18:57] healed him and re healed him after he
[18:59] received the message one year ago. Short
[19:01] shortly after he got saved, he was
[19:03] diagnosed with cancer and his doctors
[19:05] persuade him to take a chemical
[19:06] treatment. He heard of the miraculous
[19:08] healing power in two testimonies of
[19:11] brother Yang's liver cancer who
[19:13] apparently had a funeral uh ready and
[19:14] arranged for him and uh sister fans h
[19:18] hepatitis B. So, this brother refused
[19:20] the chemical treatment but kept going to
[19:22] church. Just last week, he got an
[19:24] all-around physical check and the
[19:26] results came back and the doctors told
[19:27] him that all of his liver functions are
[19:29] normal. I want to thank the Lord for
[19:31] that.
[19:39] [Music]
[19:41] We rejoice in that testimony, God's
[19:43] healing power. Simple faith can bring
[19:46] the master on the scene, can't it? You
[19:49] know, his uh outstanding service on
[19:51] Wednesday with brother Dier, I'm sure
[19:53] you all remember how he just had these
[19:56] words uttered forth from him that God is
[19:59] gathering a cloud of witnesses. You
[20:00] remember that?
[20:02] &gt;&gt; Well, just yesterday, we had another
[20:05] witness go beyond the curtain of time.
[20:07] Another pastor, this is brother Rashid
[20:10] Gil from Pakistan. He was in the pulpit
[20:13] preaching. I couldn't think of a better
[20:14] way to go to step on into eternity than
[20:17] from right behind the sacred desk. Amen.
[20:19] And so while we mourn the loss of our
[20:22] precious brother Rashid in Pakistan and
[20:24] the bride in Pakistan is is mourning his
[20:26] loss, we do not sorrow as others do. For
[20:29] our brother is a part of that great host
[20:32] of witnesses. But we do want to remember
[20:34] the family in prayer today. And also for
[20:37] brother uh Jean Fransis in Mauritius. He
[20:41] is uh diagnosed with a kidney failure.
[20:44] He's also suffering with anemia, but his
[20:48] confession is in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[20:50] Amen. Let's join our hearts together in
[20:52] faith this morning. Heavenly Father, you
[20:55] truly are the master of all things. When
[20:59] you were in the boat with the disciples,
[21:01] Father, you were at such peace that you
[21:03] were able to sleep in the midst of a
[21:06] storm, a trial that had been
[21:08] predestinated, oh God, to stir the faith
[21:11] of your disciples for them to be able to
[21:13] recognize that when you are in the boat
[21:15] with us, there's nothing that we have to
[21:17] fear. And Lord, though we may see the
[21:20] storms of life raging about, though we
[21:22] may see how the cancers and demon forces
[21:25] are assailing your bride, Lord, we can
[21:28] think of many this morning, spirits of
[21:30] infirmities that are keeping those from
[21:32] service this morning like our sister
[21:34] Doris. Lord, we rebuke this lung
[21:36] infection and this cold. In the name of
[21:38] Jesus Christ, we rebuke this this spirit
[21:41] of infection that's on this brother
[21:43] Josiah, Lord, down in Louisiana. We pray
[21:46] for him that he also would be able to
[21:48] recognize that the master is in his boat
[21:51] that his master is with him. Oh father,
[21:54] for this one that oh God has recognized
[21:56] a God that is on the scene. And our
[21:59] brother Mike Gier Lord that's what we
[22:01] live for to be a witness to those around
[22:03] us that they may see this power of your
[22:06] presence Lord living within us. And
[22:09] brother Mike's boss Lord having
[22:11] recognized something different about our
[22:13] brother reaches out in faith Lord to ask
[22:16] for prayer for his son Jason. Lord Jesus
[22:19] we don't know all the situation. We
[22:21] don't know why he's in this coma. But
[22:23] Lord Jesus, this man is asked and oh
[22:26] God, Lord, how we're reminded in the
[22:28] scriptures that you when we were
[22:30] invited, you always went to the scene.
[22:33] Lord, this man is inviting you to come
[22:35] on the scene. And may you confirm his
[22:38] prayer desire and this request for your
[22:40] glory, for your honor, Father. Oh Lord
[22:43] Jesus. Lord, we also think of uh Brother
[22:47] Ron West, Lord, who's going in for
[22:49] surgery. We think of the Gil family,
[22:52] Lord, that is mourning the loss of a
[22:54] husband, of a father. How our precious
[22:57] Rashi, Lord, is is held in such high
[23:00] regard and esteem as a minister, as one
[23:02] who has labored in these things. Lord,
[23:05] even having stood behind this pulpit and
[23:07] ministered to us. We pray for the
[23:08] family. We pray for the bride in
[23:10] Pakistan as we see, Lord Jesus, how
[23:13] you're moving on a political scene. how
[23:15] Lord Jesus that Lord God those ones that
[23:18] are under the spirit of Israel's
[23:20] religion oh God are being thrust to the
[23:23] forefront and Lord we know that this is
[23:25] your doing for you raise up kings and
[23:27] you bring them down Lord you're wanting
[23:29] to have oh God a window I believe of a
[23:32] of an entrance of your word into these
[23:35] countries where they have been so rigid
[23:37] and so firmly against the gospel the
[23:40] very lands where the gospel has been
[23:42] 2,000 years ago Lord send forth your
[23:45] word into these countries like Pakistan
[23:47] and where Islam is named. We pray Lord
[23:50] for the peace of these countries that
[23:52] your gospel could go in and comfort the
[23:54] bride in Pakistan Lord as they have lost
[23:57] the Lord apostle of their faith as it
[23:59] were in that country. We pray for
[24:02] brother Jean Franis Lord with this
[24:04] kidney failure and anemia. May you
[24:06] strengthen him. May you deliver him as
[24:08] his confession is in you Lord. other
[24:10] requests for brother David's hanger. We
[24:13] pray you'd touch him as well. And Lord,
[24:15] the unspoken request, Lord, you see each
[24:18] and every heart this morning. Lord God,
[24:21] as we raise our hands in this building,
[24:24] Lord, across the globe, as those who are
[24:26] listening by way of internet or
[24:28] telephone or who may even listen at a
[24:30] later date, Lord, you're not bound by
[24:33] time. You're not bound by distance.
[24:35] You're the everpresent help in a time of
[24:37] need. And Lord, our faith is anchored in
[24:39] you this morning. We've seen too much.
[24:41] We've heard too much like the testimony
[24:43] out of China. Lord, bless and move for
[24:46] your glory. Show your power. Show your
[24:49] presence. And Father, as we come to the
[24:51] order of the ministry of the word, Lord,
[24:54] we've created, I believe, by faith an
[24:56] atmosphere of our worship. Lord, now for
[25:00] the seed to find good ground. Lord, we
[25:04] want our hearts to be open. We don't
[25:06] want to be rigid. We don't want to be
[25:08] cast in our own ideas. Loosen us,
[25:10] Father. Work the ground. And Lord,
[25:12] anoint brother Ed as you would come that
[25:14] that word with life, that word with
[25:17] power, that word with a dynamics that'll
[25:20] change our bodily conditions and our
[25:22] spiritual conditions would come forth
[25:25] over this sacred desk and minister to
[25:27] your bride. As we ask all these mercies
[25:30] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[25:32] Amen.
[25:38] Amen. You may be seated.
[25:43] [Music]
[25:49] Amen. God bless you. I want to welcome
[25:51] everyone tonight this morning. Used to
[25:53] doing this evening service. Keep saying
[25:55] good night or good evening. But uh God
[25:58] bless you. It's good to have everyone
[25:59] here. If you're on the telephone, hookup
[26:02] or on the internet, we want to say God
[26:03] bless you. I have two announcements uh
[26:05] to make and as I'm doing that, Sister
[26:06] Elizabeth Neighbor and Rhysa Young have
[26:09] a special for us. Why don't you come and
[26:10] get ready at this time? Uh just a note
[26:13] from Jeremy Bergen. Anyone interested in
[26:16] helping to create content for the
[26:18] witnessing website uh presented by

[26:22] bulletin board. There will be uh various
[26:25] sessions on Saturday and you want to

[26:45] uh I forgot actually forgot to write it
[26:46] down.
[26:49] I forgot what it was now. That's all
[26:51] right. Why don't we just sing I Know the
[26:52] Master of the Wind again. I love that
[26:53] song.
[26:55] I know the master of the way.
[27:03] I know the maker of the rain.
[27:10] Oh, he can call and make the sun shine
[27:15] again.
[27:18] I know the master of the wind.
[27:38] [Music]
[27:55] met the man and a woman
[27:59] in a town called Shunam.
[28:02] They'd made a home for Elisha and found
[28:06] favor in his eyes.
[28:10] So God sent them a miracle.
[28:13] the only thing they had longed for.
[28:17] Within a year they would hold a son as
[28:20] Elisha prophesied.
[28:25] One day they ran from the field. They
[28:28] brought the child to his mother.
[28:31] She held his head there on her knee
[28:34] until he died at noon that day.
[28:39] She didn't tell anyone. She ran straight
[28:43] to the man of God.
[28:46] And if anybody asked her, she replied
[28:50] while on her way, "It is well."
[28:55] It is well.
[28:58] [Music]
[28:59] There is peace in my despair, knowing
[29:03] God will hear my prayer, and I will
[29:07] cling
[29:10] &gt;&gt; to the promise that he brings.
[29:13] Even death can have no sting, no power
[29:17] in hell.
[29:20] [Music]
[29:22] In his presence I will dwell
[29:27] where it is well.
[29:32] [Music]
[29:35] Elisha stood by the bedside
[29:38] where she lay the boy when he died and
[29:42] prayed a prayer upon him and he breathed
[29:45] new life again.
[29:49] friend. God doesn't change.
[29:52] If you have that woman's faith,
[29:56] he'll send you a miracle. And until
[29:59] then, you can say, "It is well."
[30:05] It is well.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; There is peace in my despair, knowing
[30:12] God has heard my prayer, and I will
[30:16] cling.
[30:19] to the promise that he brings. Even
[30:22] death can have no sting, no power in
[30:26] hell.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; In his presence I will dwell
[30:35] where it is well.
[30:39] It is well.
[30:42] There is peace in my despair. Knowing
[30:46] God has heard my breath and I will cling
[30:52] &gt;&gt; to the promise that he brings. Even
[30:56] death can have no sting, no power in
[31:00] heaven.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; In his presence I will dwell. I will
[31:11] &gt;&gt; in his presence. I will
[31:16] where it is. Well,
[31:21] [Music]
[31:24] it is well.
[31:30] [Music]
[31:32] It is
[31:35] well.
[31:47] Thank you, sister and sister Elizabeth.
[31:49] We're going to be turning the service at
[31:50] this time to our pastor, brother Red. As
[31:52] he comes, I'd like to sing number 357.
[31:54] Jesus, draw me close.
[31:57] Closer, Lord, to thee.
[32:01] Jesus draw me close
[32:08] closer Lord to you.
[32:12] [Music]
[32:14] Let the world around me.
[32:26] Oh Jesus.
[32:30] [Music]
[32:38] For I desire to worship
[32:43] and
[32:46] [Music]
[32:51] Jesus Heat. Heat. Heat.
[32:54] [Music]
[33:02] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[33:04] [Applause]
[33:12] Jesus
[33:15] Christ
[33:25] for Ius.
[33:29] [Music]
[33:38] Heat. Heat.
[33:39] [Music]
[33:48] Oh, let the world around me fade away.
[34:00] Jesus Christ
[34:02] [Music]
[34:08] to you.
[34:10] [Music]
[34:11] I desire to worship
[34:16] and
[34:17] obey.
[34:19] [Music]
[34:23] &gt;&gt; That's my desire today to worship and
[34:26] obey both. Hallelujah. I think worship
[34:30] without obedience is not really a very
[34:34] sincere worship, but we're here to
[34:36] worship and obey, right? Amen.
[34:40] Uh I have a announcement about next
[34:43] Sunday
[34:45] because the youth camp will be taking
[34:46] place uh starting on the on Friday. So
[34:51] on next Sunday, we're we will only have
[34:54] one service and that will be at 11:00.
[34:58] We're hoping that everyone from the uh
[35:00] youth camp will be able to get back in
[35:03] time. They're going to have to start a
[35:05] little bit early and uh to try to be
[35:07] here by that time by 11:00 and then we
[35:11] can just have that one service that day.
[35:15] Uh also want to just let you know that
[35:20] uh you see these two windows up on this
[35:22] side. There's one window here and one
[35:24] around the corner matching this that's
[35:26] over here.
[35:27] We have now uh three translation rooms
[35:33] up there that are now functioning.
[35:35] They're all equipped and wired and our
[35:37] translators are there now. And the
[35:40] fourth one actually is uh is the Chinese
[35:43] and Vietnamese work and they so there'll
[35:47] be there's room for four translators up
[35:50] there
[35:51] uh uh simultaneously. We've made them as
[35:54] soundproof as possible. There's been a
[35:56] tremendous amount of labor that has been
[35:59] involved to do that, but that has uh
[36:03] made it possible. So, Brother Madden or
[36:07] whoever's translating in the Serbian
[36:09] didn't have to go over into Brother
[36:11] Tom's office and brother Murphy goes to
[36:14] my office. And we had little we cubby
[36:17] holes up here years ago where people
[36:20] would, you know, try to uh do that kind
[36:23] of work. But today it's becoming more
[36:25] and more and more important because
[36:27] since the internet the the uh
[36:31] translations take place and then we get
[36:33] the services out to in other languages.
[36:38] Then for some time now I've had a burden
[36:42] and I'm a very very you know very
[36:45] elementary in my technology as far as
[36:48] technology and understanding is
[36:51] concerned but I just asked some I think
[36:54] very fundamental questions and one of
[36:56] the questions I asked people who know a
[36:58] lot more than I do I said now I stand
[37:01] here at the pullpit and the voice goes
[37:04] uh through the microphone and it goes to
[37:07] the server here and it's digitized and
[37:11] it goes to the server at SFU and it goes
[37:16] into their whole system and it goes up
[37:19] to the satellite and they can hear it in
[37:21] some other country providing they
[37:23] understand English. I said, "What what
[37:26] is preventing someone from uh Brother
[37:30] Murphy, for example, I know that soon as
[37:32] he speaks, he's he's he's speaking right
[37:35] now as I speak." And uh and his voice is
[37:39] going onto a onto a computer and it's
[37:41] being digitized. Why can't we send that
[37:45] simultaneously so that anyone who speaks
[37:48] Chinese can hear it anywhere in the
[37:50] world? And uh it was good question.
[37:53] Well, it takes more equipment and more
[37:55] equipment is more expense and all the
[37:57] rest of it. Well, it it looks now and
[38:00] I'd like you just to be holding it in
[38:02] prayer. looks now as though there's been
[38:04] a a commitment to to purchase the
[38:08] necessary equipment and some people
[38:11] really became burdened about it and have
[38:14] taken it upon themselves to let's get
[38:17] that equipment and be able to put I
[38:21] understand perhaps as many as eight
[38:23] languages simultaneously
[38:26] be going onto the internet and you'll be
[38:30] able to share the service with people in
[38:32] many other languages. languages and many
[38:33] other lands. And uh I I just believe if
[38:37] God opens a door for us, we should walk
[38:40] through it.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; And I'm in very much in favor of that.
[38:44] And I just want to say to all those that
[38:46] have labored and there's many things uh
[38:49] when you come here to church and you sit
[38:51] here and take in a service, believe me,
[38:54] you only see the tip of the iceberg.
[38:57] That's all you see. You just see the tip
[38:58] of the iceberg. There's people who are
[39:00] spending uh not hours, days and weeks
[39:04] and months of their time and and uh much
[39:08] of it is donated and they just give
[39:10] themselves to the ministry. And I say
[39:12] God bless them and God bless all of you
[39:15] who make that possible. Every the
[39:18] scripture tells us that every every
[39:21] joint supply
[39:23] &gt;&gt; and that's exactly what I believe it.
[39:25] every joint supply whatever it is and
[39:28] however we're able to and uh if you
[39:30] don't think you're doing enough don't
[39:32] worry you just keep pressing in and God
[39:35] will have a place for you and God does
[39:38] have a place for you I believe that with
[39:40] all my heart I want to make an
[39:42] announcement about the chapel and that
[39:45] the deacons are here and they can we've
[39:47] discussed this some time ago but we want
[39:51] to have the chapel restricted
[39:55] And only those who are preparing for the
[39:58] current service are to be in the chapel
[40:01] before the services. And musicians and
[40:05] singers who are using the chapel should
[40:08] do so in a in a prayerful uh atmosphere
[40:12] as you're getting ready to come out and
[40:14] serve the people in in worship. And I
[40:18] believe that that's important. In the
[40:20] past, we've uh we've permitted and even
[40:22] encouraged, I suppose, the young people
[40:25] who who play instruments to just play in
[40:29] the chapel while the service has been
[40:31] going on and learn the songs and so on
[40:33] so forth. But we're not going to do that
[40:35] anymore. We during the service, we want
[40:38] any all the all the young people and
[40:41] anyone here in the service. And that's
[40:44] uh that's my my desire. and and uh so I
[40:47] have asked that the the deacons if
[40:49] anyone's in the chapel during the song
[40:51] service and during the service at all
[40:53] they should be in here. You know as soon
[40:55] as you get outside of the walls all the
[40:57] talk and chat and this and that we need
[40:59] to be in here because we don't know what
[41:02] God is going to do and how God is going
[41:04] to deal with you. And so the the chapel
[41:07] will be just for the musicians and the
[41:10] singers that are preparing for the
[41:13] current service, the service that is
[41:15] just coming up. And everyone should be
[41:17] in the sanctuary during the services.
[41:22] Um
[41:24] believe that's everything. I was going
[41:26] to tell you about brother Rashid Gil,
[41:28] but I
[41:32] brother Tony has done so. And we want to
[41:34] remember the family. I don't know how
[41:36] brother how old brother Rashid was, but
[41:39] many of you here remember he has been
[41:41] here on more than one occasion and uh he
[41:45] was a kind of the workhorse in Pakistan
[41:48] and so they would really feel that loss.
[41:50] He was a real workhorse for the message
[41:53] there. Amen. Well, maybe we could just
[41:56] sing the chorus we were singing. If
[41:59] you'd like to stand and we'll get ready.
[42:01] Jesus, draw me close. We get ready for
[42:04] the word this morning. Everyone feel
[42:06] good?
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. You pray for me and pray for
[42:13] yourself. And I'll also pray for
[42:17] everyone here.
[42:25] Jesus strongly close
[42:31] [Music]
[42:38] the world around me.
[42:43] [Music]
[42:46] Yes.
[42:49] Jesus Christ
[42:54] [Music]
[42:57] to you
[43:00] for I desire
[43:03] to worship
[43:05] and obey. Let's join in just once again
[43:10] all together.
[43:13] Jesus Christ.
[43:17] [Music]
[43:25] [Music]
[43:28] Heat. Heat.
[43:41] [Music]
[43:47] I desire to worship.
[43:56] Just before we read, let's talk to the
[43:59] author.
[44:01] Almighty God,
[44:03] you are the author of life, the author
[44:06] of this word we call the Bible.
[44:10] man has put it into a book form, but you
[44:13] are the one that put it into word form.
[44:16] You're the one that spoke it. You
[44:18] inspired the prophets and sages of old
[44:22] to speak. And the word of the Lord does
[44:25] indeed come to the prophet. And we thank
[44:28] you for the messenger we have received
[44:30] in this hour. Lord, I pray that that
[44:33] word that has touched our lives will be
[44:36] ignited again with the winds of the Holy
[44:40] Spirit. Lord, that this will not be a
[44:43] head knowledge, something that we have
[44:45] learned or something that we can repeat,
[44:48] but let it be something that sinks from
[44:50] the womb of the mind down into the soul
[44:53] region. Lord, let it come into that
[44:56] third realm. Let it go beyond any of our
[44:59] emotional being. Lord, I pray going
[45:02] beyond our little material needs. May we
[45:06] see, oh God, those things that you see,
[45:09] may we, oh God, be moved by that which
[45:12] you are moved with. And I pray, Father,
[45:14] today you'll be pleased with the
[45:16] service. Pleased, oh God, with all the
[45:19] efforts, Father, of the people having
[45:21] come. We've gathered together and we've
[45:23] gathered here that we might hear words
[45:25] of thee, Lord. So I pray you'll speak
[45:28] on, oh God, having received, Father, our
[45:32] sincere desires. And now, Lord, anoint
[45:36] us each one. Anoint me as I stand here
[45:38] before the people as they stand and
[45:41] ready to receive now. And I ask, oh God,
[45:44] that you'll remove every obstacle that
[45:46] may be in our way, Lord. every obstacle
[45:49] that may be in the individual way, Lord,
[45:52] and rather than them being preoccupied
[45:54] with what was yesterday or what is
[45:57] tomorrow, remove it in the name of Jesus
[46:00] Christ. And may we now just be focused
[46:03] on this one central focal point and that
[46:09] is your presence with us, making known
[46:13] your word to us. feed the sheep
[46:16] &gt;&gt; and give us strength for the day in
[46:18] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:23] Open up your Bibles if you would please
[46:25] to Revelation the 5th chapter
[46:30] and we're going to read.
[46:32] There's only 13 verses, 14 verses in
[46:35] that uh chapter.
[46:39] And so we'll begin to read,
[46:44] believe, down to verse 10.
[46:47] And I saw in the right hand of him that
[46:49] sat on the throne a book written within
[46:53] and on the backside sealed with seven
[46:55] seals.
[46:57] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[46:59] with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to
[47:02] open the book and to loose the seals
[47:04] thereof? And no man in heaven, nor in
[47:08] earth, neither under the earth, was able
[47:11] to open the book, neither to look
[47:13] thereon. And I wept much, because no man
[47:17] was found worthy to open the book, to
[47:19] open and to read the book, neither to
[47:22] look thereon. And one of the elders sth
[47:26] unto me, weep not. Behold, the lion of
[47:28] the tribe of Judah, the root of David,
[47:31] hath prevailed to open the book, and to
[47:33] loose the seven seals thereof. And I
[47:36] beheld, and lo, in the midst of the
[47:38] throne, and of the four beasts, and in
[47:40] the midst of the elders stood a lamb as
[47:42] it had been slain, having seven horns
[47:46] and seven eyes, which are the seven
[47:48] spirits of God, sent forth into all the
[47:51] earth. And he came and took the book out
[47:54] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[47:56] the throne.
[47:58] And when he had taken the book, the four
[48:01] beasts and four and 20 elders fell down
[48:04] before the Lamb, having every one of
[48:06] them harps and golden vials full of
[48:09] odors, which are the prayers of the
[48:11] saints. And they sung a new song,
[48:13] saying, Thou art worthy to take the
[48:15] book, and to open the seals thereof. For
[48:19] thou was slain, and hast redeemed us to
[48:21] God by thy blood, out of every kindred,
[48:25] and tongue, and people, and nations, and
[48:29] hast made us unto our God, kings, and
[48:33] priests, and we shall reign on the
[48:36] earth.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[48:43] Well, it's no secret and
[48:46] it's well well known that the book of
[48:50] Revelation is a very symbolic book
[48:53] and we certainly
[48:55] I have looked to see what others have
[48:57] said about various aspects of the of
[49:01] even some of the subject matter today.
[49:03] And I can tell you when I was done I
[49:06] just said thank God for a prophet.
[49:09] I tell you, it went from east to west.
[49:12] It went from north to south. It went It
[49:14] went way out to Pluto and back.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Went all over the map. And I just I I I
[49:19] I just said, "Thank God we have an
[49:23] absolute.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; That makes sense."
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Actually makes sense.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; But it is a it's certainly an a mystical
[49:34] book.
[49:36] There's another scripture I want to read
[49:40] out of Hebrews 4:13
[49:42] that says, "Neither is there any
[49:45] creature,"
[49:47] we're a lot of creatures here today,
[49:49] "But neither is there any creature that
[49:52] is not manifest in his sight, but all
[49:56] things are naked and opened unto the
[49:58] eyes of him with whom we have to do."
[50:04] And I found it also interesting not to
[50:07] distract you from my main subject as I'm
[50:09] going to introduce in just a moment, but
[50:12] this scripture that says uh that neither
[50:17] is there any creature that is not
[50:19] manifest in his sight,
[50:23] but all things are naked and open unto
[50:27] unto the eyes of him with whom we have
[50:30] to do. And I found it very interesting
[50:32] the that this the reference to this word
[50:36] do is to whom we have to logos. The word
[50:41] is actually logos which is word. In in
[50:44] other words, God there's nothing hidden
[50:47] from God. It's not what we're doing in
[50:50] activity that he's speaking about here,
[50:51] but it is what we believe.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Our faith, our belief in the word. And
[50:56] that's what he's really talking about. I
[50:57] want to speak to you today and all of
[51:00] this will tie together as we move along.
[51:02] I want to speak to you today simply on
[51:04] the lamb of God.
[51:07] I have been taking several services
[51:09] about five on the prophet optics and uh
[51:14] I had a phone call last night matter of
[51:17] fact and uh a brother from way across
[51:20] the nation on the other side of the
[51:23] ocean the Atlantic Ocean called and said
[51:26] our pastor's been speaking on fiber
[51:29] optics. She said, "Then I went in to
[51:31] stream one of your services and I saw
[51:33] you were speaking on prophet optics."
[51:35] And I said, "Well, I that's right. For
[51:38] my part, I I like prophet optics a lot
[51:40] better than fiber optics, you know." But
[51:43] uh so we've been talking about
[51:48] the kind of eyes that God has given, the
[51:50] kind of eyesight that God has given. And
[51:53] uh uh in this in the subject today, the
[51:57] lamb of God, you may wonder how I'm
[52:01] approaching this,
[52:03] but in the Old Testament, I'm going to
[52:06] go right from Genesis to Revelation.
[52:09] In the Old Testament, the lamb was
[52:12] chosen by the person. The man went out
[52:17] and looked and chose the lamb. had to be
[52:21] uh certain had male of the first year
[52:24] and no blemishes on it. So he'd examine
[52:27] it and he'd look at it real well and
[52:29] then he would select the one. The man
[52:32] did the selecting, the man did the
[52:34] doing, the man did the sacrificing, the
[52:37] man he he arranged everything. But I
[52:41] found as I move through the scriptures
[52:43] from Genesis to the lamb that we read
[52:47] about just now this evening, that lamb,
[52:51] that's the one that's doing the
[52:52] choosing.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; He's the one whose eyes we fall under.
[52:59] It's not the man looking anymore. It's
[53:01] the lamb looking. It's the lamb leading.
[53:05] It's the lamb making the selection.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; He did so on earth. and he met Peter and
[53:12] Andrew and James and John and he called
[53:15] them. The lamb was making the selection,
[53:18] not the man anymore. And the the roles
[53:21] turned completely around. And I'm glad
[53:24] they have. And I'm going to speak to you
[53:26] about this lamb, the lamb of God.
[53:30] We start by
[53:33] uh in in Genesis we find that the
[53:38] scripture tells us that God clothed Adam
[53:43] and unto Adam and to his wife did the
[53:45] Lord God make coats of skins and clothe
[53:49] them. They don't say the scripture
[53:52] doesn't say whether it was a lamb or
[53:54] what it was. Brother Brandham said it
[53:56] was a lamb. And I'm satisfied it was a
[53:58] lamb because it's been a lamb all the
[54:00] way through the scripture.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; It's also interesting
[54:05] and I I think it's important that I
[54:07] significant that I make this mention at
[54:09] this point that the lamb is mentioned 30
[54:13] times in the new testament.
[54:17] 30 times is the lamb mentioned in the
[54:21] new testament.
[54:23] Once it is mentioned by the unic that
[54:27] was in his chariot and he was reading
[54:29] the scripture out of Isaiah 53 and he
[54:33] was asking who is he speaking of? Is the
[54:36] prophet speaking of himself or is he
[54:38] speaking of another and Philip then
[54:41] began to declare to him from the same
[54:44] scripture and preach to him of Jesus
[54:46] Christ. That's one time. And the second
[54:49] time it's mentioned uh by uh by Peter
[54:54] and speaking of that we are washed by
[54:57] the blood the precious blood of the
[55:00] lamb. Those are the two times 28 times
[55:06] out of 30 it's picked up by the apostle
[55:10] John.
[55:13] John is the only one who caught
[55:17] John the Baptist saying behold the lamb
[55:22] of God that takes away the sin of the
[55:24] world. Not Matthew,
[55:27] not Mark, not Luke, but John
[55:33] for it's it's very significant that John
[55:37] caught into the spirit of Elijah.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; He caught those words.
[55:43] that John the Baptist was speaking,
[55:46] not the others, but somehow John caught
[55:49] it. It was very significant that he
[55:51] should catch it because he was the one
[55:53] that was going to end up on the aisle of
[55:55] Patmas.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; And and there was something significant.
[55:59] There was something about him. There was
[56:00] something about his nature. He he was
[56:02] noticing something. He was catching
[56:04] words that that uh were not as
[56:06] significant to others. And he and he and
[56:09] he says it twice. He says that the only
[56:11] two times John the Baptist that spirit
[56:13] of Elijah making the declaration and the
[56:16] and the scripture tells us by John the
[56:18] Baptist's own declaration of his own
[56:21] self. He said that he who sent him said
[56:25] on whom you see the dove descending the
[56:27] same as he that shall baptize you with
[56:30] the Holy Ghost and fire. But when he did
[56:33] see him coming, he didn't say behold he
[56:36] who will baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[56:38] and fire. He uttered a different phrase.
[56:41] Behold the lamb of God that takes away
[56:44] the sin of the world. And the next day
[56:47] Jesus comes to him again and and John
[56:49] seeing him coming says, "Behold this is
[56:51] he of whom I spake. Behold the lamb of
[56:54] God that takes away the sin of the
[56:57] world." And something within John said
[57:00] that needs to be scribed. That's
[57:02] something that must not be forgotten.
[57:05] That's something the spirit of God
[57:06] within him declaring that this is
[57:09] something that has to be recorded for
[57:11] all time
[57:14] &gt;&gt; because there's a transition taking
[57:16] place now. This lamb
[57:19] now was going to have a different role.
[57:22] This lamb was going to be presented to
[57:24] the world differently than all the lambs
[57:26] of the past. And furthermore, when this
[57:29] lamb was being sacrificed, God's lamb on
[57:32] Calvary, when he was being sacrificed,
[57:34] all other lambs were dismissed
[57:39] &gt;&gt; and done away with
[57:41] &gt;&gt; at the coming of this lamb.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Tell you, it's something here to be
[57:46] sitting here today and feel
[57:48] the sense of that assurance. I have been
[57:51] called by this lamb.
[57:54] I have come under the eyesight of this
[57:58] lamb. And this lamb doesn't just look on
[58:00] the outside, but he looks down into the
[58:03] inside of my very being and can say
[58:06] there's no blemish.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:11] There's no blemish because I have paid
[58:14] the price for this one that I am
[58:17] selecting. What a glorious thought.
[58:20] Amen.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; In Eden
[58:26] in the message fellowship, the prophet
[58:28] said, "If God met a man and upon the
[58:31] basis of his faith under the shed blood,
[58:35] save the first man, Adam, he has to
[58:39] forever remain under the same program."
[58:43] He said, "God chose a place called Adam
[58:46] and Eve and shed the blood of an
[58:47] innocent one and covered them with the
[58:52] substance of that innocent one." Covered
[58:54] them with the substance of that innocent
[58:57] one with the blood upon them. That was
[59:00] the basis that man could talk to God and
[59:04] hear his word and get his word was under
[59:08] the shed blood.
[59:12] Adam and Eve did not need covering for
[59:14] God's part.
[59:17] God's eyes
[59:19] are eyes that a piece of skin upon them
[59:23] to hide their shame when they became
[59:27] knowledge became aware that they were
[59:30] naked. He didn't need they didn't need
[59:32] covering for God's but they needed to
[59:34] hide their own shame.
[59:37] And the very fact that God took
[59:39] substance and clothed them speaks
[59:43] clearly that something was lost. When
[59:47] God clothed them, it's a making a
[59:50] declaration something was lost. An
[59:53] innocence was lost. And an innocent one
[59:56] would be directly involved by restoring
[1:00:00] what they had lost.
[1:00:03] Now, the very first time that the word
[1:00:07] lamb is uttered in the Bible, I believe
[1:00:10] these things are significant. They're
[1:00:11] very significant to me and they bless me
[1:00:13] and I think they will bless you. The
[1:00:16] very first time
[1:00:19] that the word lamb
[1:00:22] is uttered in the Bible
[1:00:26] is by Isaac.
[1:00:30] a perfect type of Christ.
[1:00:33] And he's on his way
[1:00:36] up the mountain to be sacrificed.
[1:00:41] And he's carrying the wood
[1:00:45] as the one who he's reflecting Christ
[1:00:48] who will carry his cross.
[1:00:51] And he's walking up the mountain and he
[1:00:53] says,
[1:00:55] "My father," yes, my son says, "Behold
[1:00:59] the fire and the wood, but where's the
[1:01:03] lamb?"
[1:01:05] First time it's uttered in the
[1:01:07] scripture.
[1:01:09] That whole program of God is so precise,
[1:01:13] friends. It's so precise.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Don't we rejoice in it? Isn't that
[1:01:19] marvelous that the type of the lamb
[1:01:21] would be the first one who would ask,
[1:01:23] "Where is the lamb?"
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; He knew he wasn't the lamb, but there
[1:01:28] must be one.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; And I love the second time it comes out
[1:01:32] of the father's mouth. God will provide
[1:01:35] himself a lamb. Can't we say, "Praise
[1:01:38] God."
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; You see that spirit moving all the way.
[1:01:45] Almighty God himself having clothed his
[1:01:47] children. Now s some centuries have gone
[1:01:50] by and it's never been mentioned not in
[1:01:53] holy rit but here comes the young man
[1:01:56] who is of perfect type of Christ bearing
[1:01:59] his cross and where is the lamb.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; God will provide himself a lamb.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; So you can see the stage is already
[1:02:11] being set
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; so beautifully. The picture so marvelous
[1:02:15] and God is making it so abundantly clear
[1:02:20] what his program is.
[1:02:24] Where is the lamb
[1:02:26] for a burnt offering?
[1:02:29] My son,
[1:02:31] God will provide himself a lamb for a
[1:02:33] burnt offering. So they went both of
[1:02:35] them together.
[1:02:38] Then we move on.
[1:02:41] The spirit and power
[1:02:44] of Elijah was prophesied by the angel
[1:02:48] to be upon John the Baptist.
[1:02:51] We've taken a quantum leap now from
[1:02:53] Genesis to Luke's gospel to John's
[1:02:57] gospel
[1:02:59] and the spirit and power of Elijah
[1:03:01] because the Old Testament closes out.
[1:03:05] Behold, I will send you Elijah the
[1:03:08] prophet,
[1:03:09] and he will, now it's closing out, and
[1:03:12] he will restore the hearts of before the
[1:03:14] great and terrible day of the Lord, and
[1:03:16] he will restore the faith of the the
[1:03:19] heart of the children. He'll turn them
[1:03:21] back to the faith of the fathers and the
[1:03:24] fathers to the children, and the
[1:03:26] children to the fathers. But in Luke's
[1:03:29] gospel when the angel came,
[1:03:32] he's making reference now to a
[1:03:34] forerunner to Christ's coming. And he
[1:03:37] shall go before him. This forerunner
[1:03:40] shall go before Christ in the spirit
[1:03:44] and power of Elijah or Elias to turn the
[1:03:50] heart and he needs the spirit and power
[1:03:54] of Elijah to turn the hearts of the
[1:03:57] fathers to the children and the
[1:04:00] disobedient to the wisdom of the just
[1:04:03] and to make ready a people prepared for
[1:04:07] the Lord. So now John the Baptist, he
[1:04:11] related these instructions concerning
[1:04:14] Jesus given to him by God. And this is
[1:04:17] what he said.
[1:04:19] and I knew him not,
[1:04:21] but that he but he that sent me to
[1:04:25] baptize with water, the same said unto
[1:04:28] me, upon whom you shall see the spirit
[1:04:31] descending and remaining on him, the
[1:04:35] same is he which baptizeth with the Holy
[1:04:38] Ghost. Now, this is a direct
[1:04:42] word of God to John the Baptist who now
[1:04:46] was anointed with the spirit of Elijah,
[1:04:48] the spirit and power of Elijah to
[1:04:52] deliver this message. And I knew him
[1:04:55] not. But when John the Baptist saw him
[1:04:58] coming, I'm repeating this, but it needs
[1:05:00] to be repeated. When John the Baptist
[1:05:02] saw Jesus coming towards him, he cries
[1:05:05] out, "Behold the lamb of God which
[1:05:09] taketh away the sin of the world." Now
[1:05:11] the spirit and power of Elijah is upon
[1:05:15] this servant, this forerunner to utter
[1:05:18] what needs to be said. And so he utters
[1:05:21] out. He makes no reference to this is
[1:05:24] the one that's going to baptize with the
[1:05:25] Holy Ghost and fire. But he says, "This
[1:05:27] is he. This is the lamb of God that
[1:05:31] takes away the sins of the world. That
[1:05:34] is a staggering statement.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; How can any man
[1:05:40] stand on the bank of a river and point
[1:05:44] to another man, obviously a human, and
[1:05:47] say, "This is the man. Behold, this is
[1:05:50] the lamb of God." Such a phrase has
[1:05:52] never been spoken. They don't even know
[1:05:54] what that phrase means. They don't know
[1:05:57] the depth of it. This is the lamb of God
[1:06:00] that takes away the sin of the whole
[1:06:03] world.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; I can tell you friends that is a we we
[1:06:08] know these phrases. We hear it from
[1:06:10] childhood. But to hear that for the
[1:06:12] first time, there's nobody could grasp
[1:06:15] that.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; The man who said it, I doubt if he knew
[1:06:18] the depths of it himself. It was just
[1:06:21] something moving within him. But there's
[1:06:23] another one standing there. and John the
[1:06:26] Apostle and he catches that.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; What he's really catching is the spirit
[1:06:32] and power of Elijah,
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; catching a hold of it.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; He caught it.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; And I just rejoiced. I said, "Oh, God,
[1:06:43] there's another group of people that may
[1:06:44] not know a whole lot of things, but we
[1:06:47] have caught into the words and the
[1:06:49] spirit and the power of Elijah. Yeah,
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; we've caught his statements. We caught
[1:06:56] the words and they have so deep they
[1:06:59] marked us indelibly they branded our
[1:07:02] minds and we can't get rid of it. We
[1:07:04] can't shake it. It's part of our life.
[1:07:06] It's part of our what we what we breathe
[1:07:08] and what we eat. It's part of us.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; We have got the spirit and power of
[1:07:14] Elijah.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; And it is a power.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; It's an absolute power. It's not some
[1:07:20] waffle dish rag spineless thing and
[1:07:24] marshmallow can't stand up. It is a
[1:07:26] spirit in power.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; And I can say to John the Apostle
[1:07:30] someday, God blessed you, John. I God
[1:07:34] allowed me to see that one day and I
[1:07:36] rejoice. You caught it. I caught it. And
[1:07:39] I fellowshipped with a lot of other
[1:07:40] people that caught it.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; And we want to follow
[1:07:54] this Apostle John now because he's
[1:07:57] actually going to relate a transition of
[1:08:00] the lamb.
[1:08:01] John the Baptist introduced him, but
[1:08:04] it's really the Apostle John who depicts
[1:08:07] and describes this transition from the
[1:08:10] little lamb that was a an animal out in
[1:08:13] the field and typed through the
[1:08:16] scripture. But now he's going to take
[1:08:18] and describe this transition,
[1:08:21] incredible transition of this lamb, the
[1:08:24] lamb of God.
[1:08:29] We want to follow the apostle John
[1:08:32] through some of the experiences that God
[1:08:34] gave gave in preparing for his most
[1:08:38] important time of his life which I
[1:08:42] believe when he would write his visions
[1:08:45] giving the world the book of
[1:08:46] revelations.
[1:08:49] The Apostle John caught that spirit of
[1:08:51] Elijah
[1:08:53] and thus was the only one that
[1:08:57] identified the Lord Jesus as the lamb of
[1:09:00] God.
[1:09:03] Only John. Now he was one of the four
[1:09:07] protectors. We concluded last Sunday
[1:09:12] on the four protectors.
[1:09:14] the word. It's not that it's not that
[1:09:17] Jesus needed to be protected as the as
[1:09:20] David. I'm sorry. Peter took his sword
[1:09:24] and was going to protect the Lord Jesus.
[1:09:27] And Jesus said, "Put up your sword.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; They that live by the sword, they'll die
[1:09:31] by the sword." I don't need that kind of
[1:09:33] protection.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; But the kind of protection that Matthew,
[1:09:37] Mark, Luke, and John, they recorded what
[1:09:40] he said.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; They recorded what he did. and they
[1:09:44] could declare this truly was the son of
[1:09:47] God.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; He did what no other man did. He spoke
[1:09:51] what no other man spoke. Never a man
[1:09:53] spake like this man. This indeed was
[1:09:56] none other than the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:09:58] And the and the scripture follows
[1:10:00] through in continuity. And then those
[1:10:02] four which were around him, they
[1:10:06] reported they recorded his life, the
[1:10:09] record of his life. And it's here in the
[1:10:12] book.
[1:10:14] This is this is the book that was
[1:10:16] sealed.
[1:10:17] Brother Brandon refers to it as the
[1:10:19] Bible.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; And the seals also well, we won't get
[1:10:24] into it, but
[1:10:26] he said that the seals at the time when
[1:10:30] the seals are revealed or made known,
[1:10:33] seven thunders uttered their voice. And
[1:10:36] John the Apostle was going to take up
[1:10:39] his pen and write and he was instructed
[1:10:42] write them not. Brother Brandham says
[1:10:45] now the seals are one thing and the
[1:10:46] thunders are another. And a lot of
[1:10:48] people in the message get confused
[1:10:50] because they say oh well they take the
[1:10:52] seals the the seals are the seals book
[1:10:54] that have been spoken now and say well
[1:10:56] that's not the thunders. The thunders
[1:10:58] are something else. Oh that's another
[1:10:59] great revelation coming. No that's not
[1:11:01] it at all. The seals the seals are the
[1:11:04] symbol that sealed sealed the uh sealed
[1:11:07] the truth.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; The the the seal the symbol sealed it.
[1:11:12] Said he saw you know four horse riders
[1:11:15] and the first one was the first one was
[1:11:17] white and the next one was red and the
[1:11:19] next one was black and the next one was
[1:11:20] pale. No, nobody knows what that is. And
[1:11:23] that was the symbol that sealed the
[1:11:25] truth. And then one day, God would take
[1:11:28] and loose the seal. And the voice that
[1:11:31] loosed it was a thunder.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; And so the thunder revealed that the
[1:11:36] symbol sealed it. It's just that simple.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; And so in the opening of the seals, and
[1:11:41] then God has now another one in the
[1:11:44] spirit and power of Elijah
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; to catch the revelation
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; that the spirit and power of Elijah had
[1:11:53] announced would come. And so we want to
[1:11:56] follow John
[1:11:58] who caught this. It's only John, one of
[1:12:01] the four protectors. He's the only one
[1:12:04] that saw Jesus and identified him as a
[1:12:07] lamb that taketh away the sin of the
[1:12:09] world.
[1:12:12] I think that's an outstanding statement.
[1:12:16] Now the same spirit
[1:12:19] and power of Elijah speaking the word of
[1:12:21] the Lord before the dreadful day of the
[1:12:23] Lord before the dreadful day of the
[1:12:25] Lord. Turning the hearts of the children
[1:12:28] back to the faith of the fathers. So the
[1:12:31] children hear and are catching that same
[1:12:35] spirit. Not just not just one or two,
[1:12:38] but the spirit the children are catching
[1:12:41] the spirit of Elijah as it speaks forth
[1:12:44] the words of God.
[1:12:48] I can see John
[1:12:52] as an example.
[1:12:54] I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:12:57] laboring on this just a wee bit. I want
[1:12:59] you to just keep your attention focused,
[1:13:01] please. The next day, John see Jesus
[1:13:04] coming to him. That's John the Baptist.
[1:13:07] And saith, behold the lamb of God which
[1:13:10] taketh away the sins of the world. This
[1:13:13] is he of whom I said after me cometh a
[1:13:16] man which is preferred before me for he
[1:13:19] was before me.
[1:13:23] And now it'll be John. I want you to see
[1:13:27] him as one of the protectors.
[1:13:30] There were cherubams in Eden that turned
[1:13:33] every way with a flaming sword. Not
[1:13:36] protecting the way of life, protecting,
[1:13:39] not protecting the tree of life, but
[1:13:41] protecting the way.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Adam lost his way.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; This generation has lost their way.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; They don't know. And if it wasn't for
[1:13:52] the word of God, if it wasn't for the
[1:13:53] message of the hour, we wouldn't know
[1:13:55] how to do even some very elementary
[1:13:57] things.
[1:13:59] Have you got that?
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't know hardly how to dress,
[1:14:02] wouldn't know how to live, wouldn't know
[1:14:04] how to speak, wouldn't know how to
[1:14:06] worship, wouldn't know how to do hardly
[1:14:08] anything. And so the these protectors
[1:14:10] have always been around the word.
[1:14:14] I don't know if I can say it just
[1:14:17] clearly the way someone has said it, but
[1:14:19] they said that the
[1:14:21] the center of the world is Israel
[1:14:25] and the center of Israel is Jerusalem
[1:14:29] and the center of Jerusalem is the
[1:14:31] temple
[1:14:32] and the center of the temple
[1:14:35] is the holy of holies and the center of
[1:14:38] the holy of holies is the ark and the
[1:14:42] center of the ark is the word.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; And I think that's very well put.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; It is the center.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; It's the focal point.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; And God's eyes,
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; his eyes are on that word.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; And it shall be fulfilled.
[1:15:04] And so John, I see him, not Matthew, not
[1:15:07] Mark, not Luke, but John.
[1:15:10] He he has to he has to protect it from
[1:15:13] one side.
[1:15:15] And this side is that this one that's
[1:15:16] coming must be identified as the lamb of
[1:15:19] God. It that must not slip by and not be
[1:15:23] kept. It must not be recorded.
[1:15:26] Look how significant
[1:15:29] this is to us.
[1:15:32] And it's only in the New Testament by
[1:15:35] John outside of the book of Revelation
[1:15:38] is the only two times the lamb
[1:15:41] is identified. And here's this apostle
[1:15:46] John now with a spirit that's upon him
[1:15:49] standing there is at where and John the
[1:15:53] Baptist seeing this man coming and John
[1:15:56] catching that it's as though he took
[1:15:59] that flaming sword as it were and said
[1:16:01] that must be held that must be protected
[1:16:04] the people of the earth must know the
[1:16:06] redeemed must know this is the lamb of
[1:16:09] God that takes away the sin of the world
[1:16:12] and it shall be declared It shall come
[1:16:14] down through all the centuries and you
[1:16:16] people here today shall hear it. Not
[1:16:18] just read it as a statement in a book,
[1:16:20] but you will you will also participate
[1:16:23] in the spirit that he caught a hold of.
[1:16:25] Amen.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; It was only John,
[1:16:31] Peter, and James
[1:16:34] that were permitted by Jesus to come
[1:16:36] into the into the room where Jesus
[1:16:39] raised the daughter of Gyrus from the
[1:16:42] dead.
[1:16:47] And the Bible even says,
[1:16:49] "And he suffered no man to follow him,
[1:16:53] save Peter and James and John."
[1:16:57] Peter was not one of those protectors.
[1:17:01] James was not one of those protectors,
[1:17:02] but John was, and he needed to be there.
[1:17:06] And he and the Bible says they put them
[1:17:08] all out and would allow no man to be
[1:17:10] with them but Peter, James, and John.
[1:17:14] Apostle John walked with this lamb
[1:17:18] up the mount of transfiguration
[1:17:23] and a Peter recorded it and he said for
[1:17:25] he received from God the father honor
[1:17:28] and glory when there came such a voice
[1:17:31] to him from the excellent glory this is
[1:17:33] my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased
[1:17:37] and this voice which came from heaven we
[1:17:39] heard when we were with him in the holy
[1:17:42] mount
[1:17:44] The Apostle John
[1:17:46] needed to be there
[1:17:49] on the Mount Transfiguration. And on the
[1:17:51] Mount Transfiguration, John saw the
[1:17:53] rehearsal of the coming of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:56] You see how he's being prepared and
[1:17:59] trained.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said in Revelation
[1:18:05] chapter 4 in that series, he said over
[1:18:07] in this place, then he saw the coming or
[1:18:10] the rehearsal. The first thing he saw in
[1:18:13] the coming was Moses
[1:18:16] represented the dead saints that would
[1:18:18] be resurrected. And that's all the six
[1:18:21] ages that they slept six a six church
[1:18:24] ages. Not only that, Elijah was there,
[1:18:28] the messenger of the last day with his
[1:18:30] group. So now here's John. He's caught
[1:18:33] the spirit of Elijah, the spirit and
[1:18:36] power of Elijah coming out of out of
[1:18:38] John the Baptist. And now he's one
[1:18:41] that's chosen to go up in the mount. He
[1:18:44] sees the dead girl raised from the dead.
[1:18:46] There's no mistake in his mind that this
[1:18:49] indeed is a different lamb of God.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; This is different from anything he's
[1:18:54] seen. He sees the dead raised. And now
[1:18:56] he goes up in the mount transfiguration
[1:18:58] and the prophet and spirit of Elijah in
[1:19:00] this day catches it. Says the first
[1:19:02] thing John saw was Moses.
[1:19:05] Then he saw Elijah.
[1:19:08] What an experience that must have been.
[1:19:11] And he's recording it.
[1:19:14] And he says, "Not he saw Elijah, the
[1:19:16] messenger of the last day, with his
[1:19:19] group or the transfigured, the
[1:19:21] raptured." So he when he saw Moses, that
[1:19:24] was all asleeping. When he saw Elijah,
[1:19:26] that was all the the ones who be changed
[1:19:29] and raptured. There there's the Apostle
[1:19:32] John. He's looking at the resurrection
[1:19:34] and the rapture all on the mount.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:19:38] Hallelujah.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I hope you're staying with
[1:19:40] me.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; And he's looking at Jesus glorified.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; So, he sees them that lived and died. He
[1:19:47] sees them that lived and were changed.
[1:19:49] And he sees he sees Christ glorified. He
[1:19:53] sees all of it right there. And the
[1:19:55] prophet how he brought out that he saw
[1:19:57] the whole cycle of life. The whole cycle
[1:20:00] of life was there. There they were as as
[1:20:03] mortal beings. There was Moses
[1:20:05] representing the sleeping. There was
[1:20:09] Elijah representing those that are
[1:20:12] changed and and raptured. And there's
[1:20:14] Jesus in the glorified state which all
[1:20:17] of us will come to.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The whole cycle was there on
[1:20:22] the mountain.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; And that's why he said and he took them.
[1:20:26] He said, "Some of you will not taste
[1:20:28] death till you will see the son of man
[1:20:30] coming in his glory, in his power. the
[1:20:34] kingdom of God coming. They saw the
[1:20:36] kingdom of God, my brother, my sister,
[1:20:38] that is the kingdom of God.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Here we are as mortals, but we're in the
[1:20:43] kingdom of God. The kingdom of God comes
[1:20:45] not by observation, but it's within you.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; We're in the kingdom of God.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Some have slept. Some have gone the way
[1:20:54] of the ground. They're in the kingdom of
[1:20:56] God represented by Moses on that day.
[1:20:58] Some have been translated and they re
[1:21:01] are represented by Elijah. And Jesus
[1:21:03] stood there representing all of us. For
[1:21:05] we shall be glorified. We shall have a
[1:21:08] body like unto his glorious body.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; I tell you, if you don't want that body,
[1:21:15] you can just have the one you have.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; You can have whatever choice you want.
[1:21:18] But as far as I'm concerned, it's that
[1:21:20] glorified body that I desire.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; That's we're living for. Amen.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; He said they saw the rehearsal of it.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; John along with James his brother and
[1:21:34] Peter were taken further into the garden
[1:21:38] than any others.
[1:21:42] Jesus went into the garden
[1:21:46] and the Bible says that
[1:21:50] he took them further.
[1:21:53] James,
[1:21:56] John his brother, John and James his
[1:21:58] brother and Peter
[1:22:01] brought them further into the garden,
[1:22:02] brought them further into his experience
[1:22:06] when actually the spirit would leave him
[1:22:09] and they would see that moment.
[1:22:12] Perhaps they couldn't see it physical
[1:22:15] with their physical eyes, but they would
[1:22:17] see him come into that agony. And the
[1:22:19] Bible says then that he left them and
[1:22:21] went just a short distance, just a
[1:22:24] little distance, and he fell.
[1:22:27] And Apostle John, Peter and James
[1:22:30] witnessed that and saw that agony and
[1:22:32] that expression and perhaps looking up,
[1:22:36] "My soul is exceeding
[1:22:39] sorrowful unto death." He says to them,
[1:22:42] "Try ye here.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Wait with me."
[1:22:47] John had that pull.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Terry here and he went a little further
[1:22:53] and fell.
[1:22:55] Father, if it be possible,
[1:22:58] let this cup pass from me.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, not my will, thine be
[1:23:05] done.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; I tell you, John saying this is a
[1:23:10] different lamb. I don't know perhaps
[1:23:13] everything that
[1:23:15] John the Baptist was alluding to or what
[1:23:17] he was referring to, but this is like
[1:23:20] nothing other, nothing else that has
[1:23:24] ever I could possibly experience what
[1:23:26] I'm experiencing now.
[1:23:29] And John was to witness the crucifixion
[1:23:33] of Jesus and he was struck by something
[1:23:37] and he's the only one that caught it.
[1:23:42] A bone of him shall not be broken. He's
[1:23:46] still on the lamb.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; He's still that that has consumed him
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; that he's caught that
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; and he's the only one. And he's he he's
[1:23:57] there at the crucifixion and and and he
[1:23:59] records and then then came the soldiers
[1:24:01] and break the legs of the first because
[1:24:04] they had been instructed the Jews.
[1:24:05] Therefore, because it was the
[1:24:07] preparation that the bodies should not
[1:24:09] remain upon the cross on the Sabbath
[1:24:12] day,
[1:24:14] for that Sabbath day was the high and
[1:24:17] high day, high holy day. They besought
[1:24:21] Pilate
[1:24:22] that their legs might be broken and that
[1:24:25] they might be taken away.
[1:24:28] And John, only John, not Matthew, not
[1:24:31] Luke, not Mark.
[1:24:33] He says, "And then came the soldiers,
[1:24:35] and they break the legs of the
[1:24:36] Pharisees, watching it, and of the other
[1:24:39] which was crucified with him. And when
[1:24:40] they came to Jesus, they saw that he was
[1:24:43] dead already."
[1:24:45] And they break not his legs.
[1:24:48] But one of the soldiers with a spear
[1:24:50] pierced his side, and forth with came
[1:24:53] out their blood and water. And he that
[1:24:56] saw it, speaking of himself, I saw it,
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; and I bear record.
[1:25:02] and his record is true.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; And he knoweth that he saith is true,
[1:25:10] and that you might believe. If there'd
[1:25:14] be anybody here that would dare doubt
[1:25:16] this, I would say there's no hope for
[1:25:19] you. You are hellbound. If you deny this
[1:25:22] record, he's recording the testimony of
[1:25:26] the lamb of God.
[1:25:31] And he says, "For these things were
[1:25:33] done." He says, "My record is true."
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; And these things were done that the
[1:25:38] scripture might be fulfilled. That
[1:25:41] spirit that was on him caught back into
[1:25:43] the Old Testament, just a a vague
[1:25:46] scripture, as it were. And that the
[1:25:48] scripture might be fulfilled. A bone of
[1:25:51] him shall not be broken.
[1:25:54] Amen.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; The only one that caught it.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; He caught the scripture of the Old
[1:26:00] Testament
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; from Moses
[1:26:04] in Numbers 9 and 12. They shall leave
[1:26:07] none of it until the morning. Speaking
[1:26:11] of the sacrificed lamb, the Passover
[1:26:13] lamb, they shall leave none of it till
[1:26:15] morning, nor break any bone of it. Can
[1:26:19] you imagine
[1:26:21] two, four, six words?
[1:26:24] Here's a man. He's viewing a
[1:26:27] crucifixion. He's viewing a most uh
[1:26:30] brutal killing of a man called Jesus
[1:26:33] Christ. And he's caught up in it. He's a
[1:26:36] follower of it.
[1:26:38] He's a disciple. He's given all. He's
[1:26:41] left his trade. He's left his business.
[1:26:44] He's left his family. And it all seems
[1:26:47] to be crashing down on him in this
[1:26:50] incredible moment. But that spirit of
[1:26:54] God is so faithful. And that spirit that
[1:26:57] was on him and that spirit that's in you
[1:27:00] will direct you even to six words if
[1:27:02] necessary.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; And you'll know this is it.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; God doesn't have to speak volumes and
[1:27:09] books and encyclopedias to the
[1:27:11] believers. He simply says sometimes one
[1:27:14] word come.
[1:27:16] and that's enough.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Forsake
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; where you have been. Repent and that's
[1:27:22] enough. Be filled with the spirit and
[1:27:25] that's enough. Be baptized in water for
[1:27:28] the for the b for the remission of sins
[1:27:31] and that's enough.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; You don't have to keep babying us along
[1:27:36] and telling us along. And then John,
[1:27:40] he sees this great sight that he's
[1:27:42] seeing and he notices here comes the
[1:27:45] soldiers. It's a high holy day. Here
[1:27:47] they come. The leaders are saying break
[1:27:50] their legs. You know why? Do young
[1:27:53] people know why they broke the legs.
[1:27:58] Because death of crucifixion is by
[1:28:00] asphixxiation.
[1:28:03] They hang.
[1:28:05] And I've described this before, but
[1:28:06] there's always young ones growing up.
[1:28:08] They hang nailed by their hands and
[1:28:10] their feet are nailed. And when their
[1:28:13] feet are nailed, their knees are
[1:28:14] slightly bent. You'll see all the all
[1:28:17] the images of the crucifixion. You'll
[1:28:20] see their knees are slightly bent. In
[1:28:22] some cases, they put a block under the
[1:28:24] feet and then they put a spike through
[1:28:26] both feet, crossed over. And that was
[1:28:29] because after you hang the ligaments and
[1:28:33] the muscles tear from the chest and the
[1:28:37] diaphragm comes up and the breathing
[1:28:40] gets shorter and shorter and they can't
[1:28:42] get a breath. And so when they can't get
[1:28:44] a breath, they straighten their legs and
[1:28:47] they can breathe for a few moments. And
[1:28:50] when that is too painful and they hang
[1:28:52] back down and they get their breath is
[1:28:55] hard pain hard to come and they stand up
[1:28:59] and they go down and they stand up and
[1:29:01] that is that long suffering of the cross
[1:29:06] and finally says well tomorrow is the
[1:29:08] high holy day and we don't want them to
[1:29:11] be on the cross. they must come down and
[1:29:13] so take and break their legs so they
[1:29:16] cannot stand up anymore and catch their
[1:29:18] breath. Go and break their legs. And so
[1:29:21] John is there. He know what happened. He
[1:29:22] sees them break the legs of the first
[1:29:24] one and go over to the second one on the
[1:29:26] other side and break the legs of that
[1:29:28] one. Then they come to Jesus
[1:29:30] and he's already
[1:29:33] given up the ghost.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; It is finished.
[1:29:40] The lamb of God.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; No man taketh my life from me. Said I g
[1:29:46] lay it down and I will take it up again.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; And he gave it. Did he not?
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Did he give it?
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; And it came back.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; He raised it up again. Did he not? Amen.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; And that spirit that's on you right now,
[1:30:06] this moment, left him when he was
[1:30:08] hanging on that wooden cross. Do you
[1:30:10] realize that? Right from the cross, that
[1:30:12] spirit went from the cross,
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; and came down
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; into you
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; and into the church.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; And we are recipients of that spirit
[1:30:23] today.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; That spirit that you have, that Holy
[1:30:27] Spirit left him at the cross. Amen.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; The spirit of life,
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; the token,
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; that I've been speaking about,
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; the token left him.
[1:30:41] And now God's eyesight, prophet optics,
[1:30:45] looks for that life within the believer.
[1:30:48] And that's that's why it says all things
[1:30:51] are manifest in his sight.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; He doesn't look at how we're dressed
[1:30:55] this morning. That's not important to
[1:30:58] him. He doesn't look at how your hair is
[1:31:00] combed or any of these other things that
[1:31:02] are so important to our friends and
[1:31:05] colleagues and associates, but he looks
[1:31:07] down into the heart. He sees the heart.
[1:31:10] I don't have to try to see it. He sees
[1:31:12] it.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; And everything's like an open book
[1:31:14] before him. And quite frankly, I love
[1:31:16] those kind of optics.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he sees it.
[1:31:23] sees my mistakes,
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; sees our errors, but he sees our desire.
[1:31:28] We have no desire for the world. We have
[1:31:31] no desire for this corruption. We have
[1:31:33] no desire to continue in this in this
[1:31:36] life, the direction it's going. Our life
[1:31:38] and our desire is for eternal things.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:58] And for whatever reason,
[1:32:04] and John recorded this, I don't know the
[1:32:07] reason, but for whatever reason, Peter
[1:32:09] decided to ask Jesus about this man,
[1:32:12] John.
[1:32:17] And Peter seeing him, seeing John who
[1:32:20] he's walked with, they've been disciples
[1:32:22] together. They've gone through
[1:32:23] everything together.
[1:32:25] But he sees him and some somehow he
[1:32:28] becomes curious and he says, "Lord,
[1:32:32] what shall this man do?"
[1:32:35] Just even in Peter, there must have been
[1:32:38] something.
[1:32:40] What is it about John? He got to lay his
[1:32:43] head on your bosom.
[1:32:47] He's he's considered the beloved
[1:32:50] disciple. But there was no animosity
[1:32:53] within Peter. But he was curious. What
[1:32:55] shall this man do? And Jesus says,
[1:33:00] if I will that he tar till I come,
[1:33:04] what is that to thee? Follow thou me.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Then went the saying abroad because it's
[1:33:12] very common amongst the believers.
[1:33:14] something is said and then everybody
[1:33:16] draws a conclusion and are off base.
[1:33:21] Then went the word around, oh, John's
[1:33:24] not going to die. This disciple's not
[1:33:26] going to die. Yet Jesus did not say unto
[1:33:29] him, he shall not die. But if I will
[1:33:32] that he tar till I come, what is that to
[1:33:34] thee?
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; The big thing here is not whether he
[1:33:38] dies or doesn't die. The big thing here
[1:33:39] is it's none of your business. Amen.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Go out and serve God.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; So many things we curious people
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; and curiosity always killed thee.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; We're not curious about things we like
[1:34:00] to know, but a lot of it we don't need
[1:34:02] to know. What is that to thee?
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Follow thou me.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; That's what's important. Right.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; But John, he was curious about that.
[1:34:15] And somehow now we see, and stay with me
[1:34:19] closely because I must move quickly.
[1:34:22] We see John carried
[1:34:25] for the testimony of Jesus Christ. He's
[1:34:28] put on the aisle of Patmas. That was
[1:34:30] God's will.
[1:34:32] And then on the aisle of Patmas, he's
[1:34:34] caught into the spirit. He's standing
[1:34:36] there in the ground, but he's caught in
[1:34:38] the spirit and he said, excuse me, and
[1:34:43] he was took away into heaven and foraw
[1:34:46] all the things that God promised and
[1:34:50] said to the disciples. He said, "What is
[1:34:53] that to you if he terries till I come?"
[1:34:55] He said he saw he saw the coming of the
[1:34:58] Lord and what would take place.
[1:35:03] He saw on earth what would take place on
[1:35:07] earth to the rapture of the church and
[1:35:11] was taken up, excuse me,
[1:35:14] and was taken up and shown plum up plum
[1:35:19] on down even to past the millennium.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; He said it was the Lord's day. He said
[1:35:30] he was in the spirit in the Lord's day.
[1:35:32] And so many people mistake, you know,
[1:35:34] oh, he was in, you know, just having
[1:35:36] some kind of an emotional experience.
[1:35:38] Had nothing to do with that. He was
[1:35:39] carried forward to the Lord's day.
[1:35:44] And he saw exactly
[1:35:47] John was carried in the spirit over into
[1:35:50] the Lord's day. And this is the day of
[1:35:53] man, but the day of the Lord shall come.
[1:35:57] and on down through the scriptures,
[1:35:58] we'll find that he was in the Lord's
[1:36:01] day, caught up in the spirit and taken
[1:36:04] over to the Lord's day. Now, friends,
[1:36:07] the reason why
[1:36:10] the reason why I I I felt so inspired to
[1:36:13] bring you through John's life now, we
[1:36:17] are here and he's on the aisle of
[1:36:18] Patmas.
[1:36:21] I think it doesn't take very much mental
[1:36:24] power to realize God prepared him for
[1:36:28] this moment.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; He was a prepared vessel. And John's
[1:36:36] first sight of this lamb
[1:36:39] includes a great deal of symbolism. A
[1:36:42] great deal.
[1:36:44] And and in the in the breach, brother
[1:36:45] Brandham says, "How can Jehovah see
[1:36:48] anything but that bloody lamb standing
[1:36:51] there?" And the lamb proceeded out into
[1:36:54] the vision. Now, here's John. And this
[1:36:57] isn't long afterwards. He said, "All
[1:36:59] these visions took place within two
[1:37:01] years." And then John now, he's the one
[1:37:04] that stood and heard John the Baptist
[1:37:07] behold the lamb of God that stuck with
[1:37:11] him. Saw him at the cross. Saw him saw
[1:37:16] the piercing. Saw the blood. The one I
[1:37:19] said is a lamb. Here he is bleeding.
[1:37:24] Sees and hears the words. Sees him come
[1:37:28] in to break the legs. And he knows the
[1:37:30] Passover lamb must not have broken legs.
[1:37:33] And he catches it. Says, "Not a leg of
[1:37:35] him shall be broken." And he sees it.
[1:37:38] It's anchored in his heart. And God has
[1:37:40] prepared him. That spirit that's upon
[1:37:42] him has prepared him all down all down
[1:37:45] through the the the the months and very
[1:37:48] short period of time. And now he's a
[1:37:50] he's on the aisle of Patmas
[1:37:53] and he hears this voice great voice and
[1:37:56] he turns around to see who it is and
[1:37:59] he's caught in the spirit to the Lord's
[1:38:01] day. But he says that the lamb advancing
[1:38:05] from glory for intercessions to make
[1:38:08] claims now for his redemption. He said
[1:38:12] the lamb he's bleeding. He's he's
[1:38:16] shaking. He's been in battle.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; He's been an intercession.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm glad. He's been an intercession
[1:38:26] for us before the father.
[1:38:32] And he has power, but he couldn't have
[1:38:35] power till he shed the blood.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; The blood was his power.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; He had to become a sacrifice before he
[1:38:43] had any power because it was the
[1:38:45] shedding of his blood that proved that
[1:38:48] he was the kinsman redeemer.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; An angel could not take that place.
[1:38:54] Another man born by sex could not take
[1:38:57] that place. When the book when someone
[1:38:59] to open the book was being searched for,
[1:39:02] the prophet says Elijah was standing
[1:39:04] there.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Elijah could do nothing. Moses was
[1:39:08] standing there. They could do nothing.
[1:39:11] And then he says, and they said, "Sir,
[1:39:13] heaven, this lamb had not been seen
[1:39:15] before."
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; And then he said he he begins to
[1:39:19] approach and he comes into John's
[1:39:22] vision. Oh, I wonder what an experience
[1:39:25] that was for John. And he sees this lamb
[1:39:27] approaching. He says, "Where's he been?"
[1:39:29] He's been back in the eternities.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Making intercession, knowing
[1:39:37] I'm going to redeem the earth.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; I'm going to redeem the world.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; And as a lamb, while a while a man the
[1:39:46] sinner in the Old Testament went
[1:39:47] searching for his lamb, now the lamb
[1:39:49] comes searching for the sinner.
[1:39:52] Amen.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; What eyes?
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; What a lamb. While that one was
[1:39:58] helpless, this one has power.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Are you catching it?
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says the lamb advancing to
[1:40:12] him out of glory.
[1:40:15] And the scripture which we read which
[1:40:17] now I focus on.
[1:40:20] And I beheld,
[1:40:22] and lo, in the midst of the throne,
[1:40:26] and of the four beasts, the four
[1:40:27] protectors,
[1:40:29] and in the midst of the elders,
[1:40:32] stood
[1:40:34] a lamb,
[1:40:36] not seated at the right hand of the
[1:40:38] majesty on high, but he stood.
[1:40:42] And the word that the Apostle John has
[1:40:45] used,
[1:40:47] he stood. He's standing because he's
[1:40:51] there to establish something.
[1:40:54] The word is to bid to stand in the
[1:40:57] presence of others and even before
[1:40:59] judges. He's standing there getting
[1:41:03] ready to take a book
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; that cannot be taken by anyone else. And
[1:41:08] the contents of the book and my brother,
[1:41:10] my sister, if you're not in this book,
[1:41:12] you'll never be there.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; This book isn't only a record of his
[1:41:16] life. It's a record of my life because
[1:41:19] his life is in the believer.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; His life is in you.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; If it's not in you, you have no part of
[1:41:28] heaven.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; But when he went to claim that book,
[1:41:30] because part of it, part of it was lost.
[1:41:33] I'm going to regain the inheritance.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to establish it. gonna
[1:41:40] make a people that can stand before them
[1:41:42] not only judges but they judge.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; And has passed from judgment unto life.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; The word he used was to make firm. He
[1:41:55] stood and the purpose of his standing.
[1:41:58] He's going to take a book and he's going
[1:41:59] to make the people who are written in
[1:42:01] that book solid, established, firm.
[1:42:06] Amen.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Make them so they can stand before any
[1:42:09] judge.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Make them so they can stand under the
[1:42:12] scrutiny of the most uh uh the eyes that
[1:42:16] have the greatest insight
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; that no one can find a fault.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; In them
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; and we're manifest
[1:42:27] before the sight of him with whom we
[1:42:29] have to do.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; With whom we have speak, to whom our
[1:42:32] testimony is. Oh, I hope you're able to
[1:42:35] follow me, friends.
[1:42:39] And he's standing to make firm, to fix,
[1:42:41] to establish. But listen to this. He now
[1:42:45] stood. Brother Brandham has said he's
[1:42:46] standing. He makes a point of it
[1:42:50] to cause a person to keep his place.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Let get down to our address.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. In case you ever have a feeling,
[1:43:03] in case you ever have something within
[1:43:06] you that is trying to draw you aside to
[1:43:09] cool off your experience, to make you
[1:43:11] think it's not worth it to live some
[1:43:13] kind of laxidasical or even backsliden
[1:43:16] life. You remember, you remember. And
[1:43:19] don't forget that a lamb stood one day.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Not for himself, for you.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; He stood there for the purpose that you
[1:43:27] shall not be moved. Amen.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; He stood there to claim a book and your
[1:43:32] life is in the book. He he he took that
[1:43:35] book not just to claim it but to
[1:43:37] establish
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; to fix
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; the life of every person who was
[1:43:43] recorded in that book.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Because he's not going to lose any of
[1:43:47] his life.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; I have three children
[1:43:54] that are all here this morning. as a
[1:43:56] human father. As a father, do you think
[1:44:00] for one second I could I could choose
[1:44:03] between one of those and say one of you
[1:44:05] go to hell
[1:44:08] and two of you go to heaven or one I
[1:44:11] have a I have a choice here. I want this
[1:44:13] one to go go with me and be with me
[1:44:15] forever and ever and the two of you are
[1:44:16] going to go into annihilation and go
[1:44:18] into suffering and go into hell.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; How could I as a human ever have that in
[1:44:24] my heart? Right.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; All that the Father hath given me shall
[1:44:30] come.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; My sheep hear my voice
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; and I will lose none of them.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; That's the lamb I'm talking about.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; That's the lamb that stood there. And
[1:44:44] whenever that slippery old subtle devil
[1:44:46] comes to you and suggest you can't make
[1:44:48] it, you just tell him a lamb of God
[1:44:51] bleeding, shaking. He's been in battle,
[1:44:53] but he won the victory and he stood
[1:44:55] there for me.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; And there's no way you can have me.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; There's no way you can claim me. And
[1:45:02] there's no way I'm going to destruction.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Let us just rejoice.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of all of our praise.
[1:45:14] He's worthy of all of our praise.
[1:45:19] Amen.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; When he stood
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; it also the same Greek word
[1:45:30] is has direct reference to the balances
[1:45:34] where they used to weigh the money
[1:45:37] and he's declaring when he stood
[1:45:40] I have the value.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have the purchase price
[1:45:46] and I'm laying it down now.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It's settled for time and
[1:45:52] eternity. I'm one who had the blood.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; The newly created blood of God
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; and I have I have paid the price.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; I have weighed it out in the balances
[1:46:05] and my children are paid for.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Listen
[1:46:12] friends, go out of this place today
[1:46:14] rejoicing. The invoice is stamped paid.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; The debt is stamped paid.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; The mortgage is invalid.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Our land stood for us.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; And he said it's paid.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; I carried the price.
[1:46:37] Amen.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; When John saw him,
[1:46:43] I'm going to be closing with this. It's
[1:46:44] a little lengthy, but I'm going to close
[1:46:45] with this. When John saw him, this lamb
[1:46:49] was indeed different
[1:46:52] because he said,
[1:46:55] "I saw this lamb stand and he stood
[1:47:00] as as it had been slain
[1:47:03] and he had seven horns."
[1:47:06] not two, but he had seven horns because
[1:47:10] horns always speak of power. This lamb
[1:47:13] now is not some little timid thing that
[1:47:15] would go out to the pasture to that the
[1:47:17] man would get. But this lamb has power
[1:47:19] and who can know his power? He he's got
[1:47:22] power and perfection. Seven seven horns.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; And which
[1:47:30] seven horns and seven eyes. Who can
[1:47:34] escape this kind of eyesight? Seven
[1:47:36] eyes, perfection in in vision. And they
[1:47:41] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[1:47:44] sent forth into all the earth. Listen
[1:47:47] friends, we have come under
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; the influence of this power
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; and we have come under the vision of
[1:47:56] these eyes
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; in the dialogue. I read it also last
[1:48:03] week. And I saw in the midst of the
[1:48:05] throne and of the four living ones, and
[1:48:08] in the midst of the elders a little lamb
[1:48:10] standing as if it had been killed,
[1:48:12] having seven horns and seven eyes, which
[1:48:14] are the seven spirits of God, sent forth
[1:48:17] into all the earth. And now
[1:48:21] follow it very close.
[1:48:23] Brother Brham gives this absolute
[1:48:26] clarity.
[1:48:33] He takes it from Revelation 3:1, which
[1:48:35] says, "These things saith he that hath
[1:48:38] the seven spirits of God and the seven
[1:48:42] stars." The one who held the seven stars
[1:48:44] in his hand. Revelation 1 says, "And he
[1:48:46] hath he hath the seven spirits of God."
[1:48:50] Once again,
[1:48:52] as in the previous four ages, the spirit
[1:48:54] is revealing
[1:48:56] our gracious Lord to us by setting forth
[1:48:58] his wonderful attributes.
[1:49:01] This time he is standing in the midst of
[1:49:05] the church.
[1:49:07] We see him as the one with the seven
[1:49:10] spirits of God and the seven stars.
[1:49:14] He said this same phrase is found
[1:49:17] four times in the book of Revelation.
[1:49:20] Revelation 1:4
[1:49:23] from the spirit from the seven spirits
[1:49:25] which are before his throne. Revelation
[1:49:28] 3:1
[1:49:30] these things sayith he that hath the
[1:49:32] seven spirits. Revelation 4 and5.
[1:49:36] And out of the throne proceeded
[1:49:38] lightnings and thunders, thunderings and
[1:49:41] voices, and there were seven lamps of
[1:49:43] fire burning
[1:49:46] before the throne, which are the seven
[1:49:48] spirits of God. Now, he's enlarged on it
[1:49:50] a wee bit. There are seven
[1:49:54] seven lamps of fire burning before the
[1:49:57] throne, which are the seven spirits of
[1:50:00] God. And finally, Revelation 5 and 6,
[1:50:03] which we read today.
[1:50:05] And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of
[1:50:08] the throne, and of the four beasts, and
[1:50:10] the midst of the elders stood a lamb as
[1:50:12] it had been slain, having seven horns
[1:50:15] and seven eyes, which are the seven
[1:50:17] spirits of God sent forth into all the
[1:50:19] earth. That's the four times it is
[1:50:21] spoken of. He said to begin with, we
[1:50:25] know of certainty that these verses are
[1:50:28] not teaching a new contrary doctrine to
[1:50:31] John 4:24.
[1:50:34] God is one. God is a he said one spirit.
[1:50:38] God is a spirit.
[1:50:41] But this is like 1 Corinthians 2:12, I'm
[1:50:45] sorry, 8-11,
[1:50:47] wherein we find one spirit, one spirit
[1:50:51] manifesting himself in nine different
[1:50:54] ways.
[1:50:56] Thus we know that the seven spirits of
[1:50:58] God mean it is one spirit, one same
[1:51:03] spirit coming forth in a sevenfold
[1:51:06] manner. Seven spirits, one spirit coming
[1:51:09] forth, he says it sent forth into all
[1:51:11] the earth. So it's sent in a sevenfold
[1:51:14] manner.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Now in Revelation 4:5, these same seven
[1:51:22] spirits are called lamps of burning,
[1:51:25] which I I repeated that once for you
[1:51:28] because brother Brandon makes a point
[1:51:29] here. Now they're called lamps of
[1:51:31] burning, which are the seven spirits
[1:51:34] before the Lord. So since John always
[1:51:37] used nothing but Old Testament symbols
[1:51:41] in the revelations because that's all
[1:51:43] they had was the Old Testament. So he
[1:51:45] used the Old Testament. He drew on it
[1:51:47] when they break the legs. He only has
[1:51:50] the Old Testament. And so we go to the
[1:51:52] Old Testament and find in Proverbs 20
[1:51:54] and 27 that the spirit of man,
[1:51:59] the spirit of man is the lamp of the
[1:52:01] Lord.
[1:52:03] These seven spirits are found to be
[1:52:06] associated with man.
[1:52:09] John the Baptist in John 5 and35 was
[1:52:13] called a burning light
[1:52:16] which should actually be translated as
[1:52:18] burning lamp.
[1:52:20] Again in Revelation 5 and 6, the seven
[1:52:23] spirits are identified as seven eyes
[1:52:27] in Zechariah 4 and10. Are you staying
[1:52:30] with me? Amen.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; For who hath despised the day of small
[1:52:34] things? For they shall rejoice and shall
[1:52:37] see the plummet in the hand of Zerubabel
[1:52:40] with those seven. They are the eyes of
[1:52:44] the Lord.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; It is very evident that the word they
[1:52:52] refers to men. Thus we see that the eyes
[1:52:56] of the Lord in th this instance are men.
[1:53:00] Of course they will be anointed men full
[1:53:03] of the Holy Ghost for God's ministries
[1:53:06] are not in the power of men but in the
[1:53:10] Holy Ghost. And putting our scriptural
[1:53:12] discoveries together, it is evident that
[1:53:15] the seven spirits of God refer to the
[1:53:18] continuous ministry of the same Holy
[1:53:21] Spirit in the lives of seven men with
[1:53:25] whom God identifies himself very
[1:53:28] closely. Can the church say amen?
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; He said they are his eyes and they are
[1:53:36] his lamps.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; And we say praise be to God. How
[1:53:41] thankful we are that God has sent such a
[1:53:44] clear message.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; And no wonder, no wonder, no man on
[1:53:50] earth could speak these things. It was
[1:53:53] the lamb that spoke them.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; It was the lamb
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; that stood and took the book. It was the
[1:54:00] lamb himself, this lamb, that delivered
[1:54:04] it to the messenger of this age. Outside
[1:54:07] of that, he would be helpless. outside
[1:54:09] of that he would know nothing about it.
[1:54:10] Even in the breach, he says, "Tomorrow,
[1:54:12] tonight is the is the first seal." He
[1:54:15] said, "I don't know one thing about it."
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; And he was humble. Came to the pulpit
[1:54:20] saying, "I would have made the most
[1:54:21] horrible mistake if he hadn't come to me
[1:54:24] today and told me exactly what it was."
[1:54:27] I thank God for that kind of voice. And
[1:54:29] I thank God for this beloved lamb
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; that stood and took my life and took
[1:54:35] yours.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? And I hold this Bible.
[1:54:38] He took your life, my brother, my
[1:54:40] sister,
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; regardless of what you think about it or
[1:54:43] the failures or all the rest of it. He
[1:54:45] took your life
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; and he was not ashamed
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; and he took it. Do you hear me? He took
[1:54:50] it and said, "I'm not ashamed of them in
[1:54:52] spite of their sin, in spite of their
[1:54:54] wrongs, in spite of their weakness. And
[1:54:55] they are mine and I have bought them.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; I had the price and I'm standing to fix
[1:55:04] them solid and to take them and bring
[1:55:06] them to myself." Hallelujah.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; I thank for the record of Apostle. I'm
[1:55:11] thankful to God today for the Apostle
[1:55:13] John.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful that God prepared him.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; And how I rejoice today
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; that we have caught the words of Elijah.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; And not just words, friends, the spirit
[1:55:24] and power of Elijah.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; We have caught into it.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh, what a
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; what a glorious thing this is.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; I hope that you can just rejoice in it.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; And so I I I just concluding with this
[1:55:46] phrase.
[1:55:48] All of this has is power to the people.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; They like to say that in politics.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Power to the people. My goodness, they
[1:55:57] get a they get elected and forget you
[1:55:59] even exist.
[1:56:01] But this
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; this one here, this lamb did not forget
[1:56:05] that you existed
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; and he transferred the power to the
[1:56:09] people.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; And they overcame him
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; by the blood of the lamb
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; and by the word of their testimony. And
[1:56:23] number three, they loved not their lives
[1:56:25] unto death.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; They overcame him. Who are they? Here we
[1:56:30] are. Who are they? Are you here? They
[1:56:34] overcame him.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; There isn't a thing him is the devil
[1:56:38] himself.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; That old dragon, the devil, that serpent
[1:56:41] that slithered into Eden cannot deceive
[1:56:44] this bride. That's what Elijah's spirit
[1:56:47] has said. And I catch the spirit and
[1:56:49] power of Elijah.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Who got that?
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And he said, "He
[1:56:57] deceived Eve, but he won't deceive this
[1:56:59] one."
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; How could Jesus have paid this price
[1:57:03] standing before the throne? How could he
[1:57:06] ever pay this price and see in the end
[1:57:08] time at the final conclusion the same
[1:57:10] devil comes and and pollutes his wife?
[1:57:14] Not a chance.
[1:57:17] Not a chance.
[1:57:19] I say not a chance.
[1:57:22] There's no way this bride can be
[1:57:24] deceived. There's no way he can corrupt
[1:57:26] this bride. No way he can do it.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Not because we're great, because he's
[1:57:32] great.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; The lamb of God.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, look to the lamb of God.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Isn't he glorious,
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; We're loving you tonight. This morning,
[1:57:44] rather. We're loving you.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; We're here, Lord. My heart is filled.
[1:57:50] Just filled overflowing. I wish Lord
[1:57:52] would would be as though we'd have all
[1:57:54] day. We could just sit and speak about
[1:57:56] these things and different ones could
[1:57:59] give their testimony of how this lamb
[1:58:01] sought them out. Oh, we bless your name.
[1:58:05] We bless your name, oh God.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the midst of the people,
[1:58:10] we bless your name. My Lord Jesus,
[1:58:12] receive the praise from our lips. Feeble
[1:58:15] as it might be, we're here to praise
[1:58:17] you.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Glory. Glory God.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Receive our thanksgiving
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; for the sacrifice of your lamb.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Let's stand, shall we? Maybe we can
[1:58:30] sing. We bless your name. We bless your
[1:58:32] name. We do that. And you you you sing
[1:58:35] it like you're singing the same like you
[1:58:37] saw the same scene that John saw.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; I saw a lamb standing shaking, bleeding,
[1:58:45] came out of the eternities where he made
[1:58:46] intercession. Interceded for you.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:50] Hallelujah.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; I don't feel worthy of it.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; interceded for you and me.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; We bless your name.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; I'm bit of a fanatic here this morning.
[1:59:03] I don't know if you're enjoying it, but
[1:59:04] I am enjoying it.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; It just suit me fine if this is our last
[1:59:09] service and we're all going home
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; today. Hallelujah.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Brother David is a been a
[1:59:16] glorious life, hasn't it?
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Enjoy it. Enjoy it.
[1:59:21] Enjoy it.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; I bless your name.
[1:59:33] I bless your name.
[1:59:38] I
[1:59:43] give you praise.
[1:59:48] Yeah.
[1:59:52] Heat.
[2:00:03] I
[2:00:05] sing the chorus once again, please. I
[2:00:08] bless your name.
[2:00:17] [Applause]
[2:00:22] Heat.
[2:00:32] Heat.
[2:00:42] I bless your name.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; First verse.
[2:00:57] Heat.
[2:01:06] Heat.
[2:01:15] [Music]
[2:01:22] Let's go to the second verse, please.
[2:01:26] [Music]
[2:01:34] You're
[2:01:36] free.
[2:01:53] Yeah.
[2:01:56] Heat.
[2:01:59] [Applause]
[2:02:06] Yeah. Heat.
[2:02:11] [Applause]
[2:02:17] Heat. Heat.
[2:02:30] I
[2:02:33] bless your name. I
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; How many know that this is more than a
[2:02:40] song? This is an experience.
[2:02:44] We have experienced that and perhaps
[2:02:46] some today are experiencing that. I say
[2:02:49] this lamb stood and stands today to fix
[2:02:54] us and establish us to cause us to be
[2:02:57] overcomers
[2:02:59] in the name of Jesus Christ. We defy
[2:03:02] those chains.
[2:03:04] [Applause]
[2:03:06] Defy those chains. Would you do it? Is
[2:03:08] there something trying to bind you? Tell
[2:03:10] that enemy, you have no power. You have
[2:03:13] no claim on me now. We defy those
[2:03:17] chains.
[2:03:19] That's not just some way timidly
[2:03:22] resisting it, but it's rising up knowing
[2:03:25] the price that has been paid. The
[2:03:27] incredible victory of Calvary.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, my friends, my believers, friends,
[2:03:34] brothers and sisters in Christ, I tell
[2:03:36] you, there is no praise that's too great
[2:03:39] for this lamb.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Don't be timid about giving him glory.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:46] [Music]
[2:03:51] The second verse, I think we ought to
[2:03:53] sing it again. Brother Rod, my voice is
[2:03:55] a little down. Will you help me, please?
[2:03:58] I want everybody to sing the second
[2:04:00] verse. And if there's anyone that's got
[2:04:02] a chain hanging on you, don't allow it
[2:04:05] any longer.
[2:04:07] You'll give glory to Christ by defying
[2:04:10] those chains now.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the power of the word will set
[2:04:15] you free. You only have to believe it.
[2:04:19] Amen. Believe it in the name of Jesus
[2:04:21] Christ. And so shall it be.
[2:04:25] Brother Rod as we sing it on Midnight
[2:04:28] Heat.
[2:04:31] Heat.
[2:04:41] Yeah.
[2:04:45] Heat.
[2:04:55] Yeah.
[2:04:58] Heat.
[2:05:09] Heat.
[2:05:19] Heat.
[2:05:28] [Applause]
[2:05:31] We bless your name.
[2:05:36] We bless you.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; I feel led of God to sing that second
[2:05:41] verse again.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Somebody here hasn't let go completely.
[2:05:47] And God by the Holy Spirit is here to
[2:05:50] deliver you in an instant.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; You go out of here a free man.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; You go out of here a free woman. Who
[2:05:59] wouldn't want freedom?
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Prison doors are open.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Prison doors are open.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Nothing is as strong as the word of God.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Not in our flesh.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Not because of what we can do, but
[2:06:15] because of what he has already done.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Let the congregation all say together,
[2:06:23] "It
[2:06:25] is finished."
[2:06:27] Can we repeat the words of Jesus once
[2:06:29] more? The lamb of God. It is finished.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; There is no more debt.
[2:06:39] Satan has no claim on you. Defy those
[2:06:43] chains in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:06:46] [Applause]
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[2:06:50] Lord. Hallelujah.

[2:10:04] so.

[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Tom, would you come and bless
[2:10:19] the people with a prayer? We send you
[2:10:21] out of this place blessed
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; to return tonight blessed.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Take the blessing with you and bring the
[2:10:28] blessing with you.

[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; We bless your name this morning.
[2:10:39] We give you honor due your holy name.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, we can say for whom the sun sets
[2:10:44] free.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; We're free indeed.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; We're free this morning by the word of
[2:10:50] God.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray God that as we receive your
[2:10:54] word, this bleeding, bloody lamb of God,
[2:10:57] we've reached out in faith and we've
[2:11:00] claimed the promise and those that were
[2:11:02] bound, they are now loosed by the word.
[2:11:06] And Father God, we want to say this
[2:11:08] morning, we're free.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; We're free to worship you and to adore
[2:11:11] you. We want to lift you up. We want to
[2:11:14] give you glory, honor, and praise. Lord,
[2:11:16] we thank you for the word this morning.
[2:11:18] We thank you for the bleeding, bloody
[2:11:20] word. We're thankful for the power in
[2:11:22] it. And we can say, Lord, with the
[2:11:24] assurance, it's setting us free. This
[2:11:27] Holy Ghost power is setting us free. So
[2:11:31] Lord, we ask that you go with your
[2:11:33] people now and let them go rejoicing.
[2:11:36] The devil's defeated. Lord, we're free.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Our chains have been loosed by the word
[2:11:43] of God. Lord, you're still a bleeding
[2:11:46] lamb.
[2:11:47] You're still a lion of the tribe of
[2:11:49] Judah, and you're still prevailing. So,
[2:11:53] Father, we're asking you now to go with
[2:11:55] us as we return tonight rejoicing around
[2:11:58] the body word of the Son of Man.
[2:12:01] Strengthen your people. Let them go
[2:12:03] rejoicing. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
