Now, this is a real easy song to sing because it's the same tune is on Christ the solid rock I stand. So, this is an old song. It goes back to the 1860s, I think, somewhere back in the 1800s. So, uh you can uh sing it along with me.

I'm gonna ask Brother Tom to come and open the service in a word of prayer. If you've got a need this morning, if you're listening in on the internet and you've got a need, want to continue to remember our um brother Ron Spencer, Lord's really done a work for him. We appreciate it. And we just want to pray that God would just completely finish that work. Amen. Tom Father, as we sing the old songs of Zion, something wells up within my own heart, saying, "It's amazing grace." Lord, the anthem of the redeemed. Amazing grace. How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. Lord, that we can look within our own lives and father can testify this morning. It's amazing that that capstone would come with shoutings of grace, grace, grace. And so, Lord, we look to you, author and finisher of our faith. Come and inspire your people again. Let us look, Lord, into the glorious truths of your word. Inspire them to us, Lord. Revelate us. Move us, Lord, into realms that our soul so longs for. So, Father, as we've gathered this morning, we pray that you will meet every need in divine presence. Lord, with uplifted heart and hands, we reach within the veil by faith, claiming the promises for their yay and in him. Amen. So, Lord, bless your children. Strengthen them by the word and let it go forth healing them body, soul, and spirit. And father we'll be sure to give you all the glory, the honor and praise due your holy name. We thank you for this opportunity in Jesus name. Amen. Man, you can have your seats. want to welcome all those who are visiting with us and uh mentioned uh Jake and Aaron the family, brother Ken, sister Diane, and also I understand brother Robert Wilson and his family are visiting from Chicago and uh brother Robert uh really happy to have you here and uh really appreciate brother Robert. If you look at the on the Believe the Sign website and you see the video, it's there because Brother Rob Robert wrote us the hack to the extension so that we could put video in there because the program didn't allow us to do that. So, Brother Robert, we really appreciate uh your help and uh and uh what you've done for the message. Amen. And um couple of announcements. There is a junior choir practice today at 3 pm and uh brother John Briner has a song for us. Brother John, maybe you could come and get ready at this time. Uh also um brother Joey and uh sister Stephanie Wartz are proud to announce the arrival of their baby boy Aaron Michael who was born Saturday, October the 13th, weighing in at 7 pounds 15 ounces. We're happy for Joey and Sister Stephanie. Also, uh this is a reminder that everyone is invited to attend a welcome reception for brother Ivan and Sister uh Asenith Wong. Um and uh I don't think uh Sister Asin rather is uh new to the assembly here. Brother Ivan, of course we know. Why don't we get you to stand so everybody knows who you are? they here? Maybe not. They might be out the fellowship room. So, anyways, they're having a um this Saturday, October the 20th, from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., there's a special welcome reception for them uh in the fellowship hall. And if you would like to attend, please be sure to use the signup sheets that are posted on the bulletin board outside the office. Amen. Think that's it, Brother John. Well, I'm thankful for the blood this morning. I uh was asked to sing the song again, but you know what? I never I never tire of singing about the blood. So, without the shedding of blood, there would have been no forgiveness for our sins. So, I'm thankful this morning. Uh we sang this a few weeks ago and um if you remember it, feel free to sing along. Um and I trust it's a blessing for you this morning. [Music] [Music] I remember the moment and I remember the place you lifted the veil from my heart and you showed me your face And oh what forgiveness an expression of your love. So I won't forget your mercy. Lord, I'll remember the blood. For I remember the blood [Music] and I remember your grace when you reached through the darkness. Lord, I knew I was saved. And I saw your love flowing down like a fountain. Save me by mercy. You gave me your love. I remember them. [Music] Lord, you gave me your covenant. It's a promise so true. It's your word unconditional. And though it binds me to you and Lord, there is a token you've applied to my soul. So I will remember Lord wherever I go. Cuz I remember the blood and I remember your grace when you reach through the darkness. Lord, I knew I was saved. And I saw your love flowing down like a fountain. [Music] You saved me by mercy. You gave me your love. I remember the blood. I know your blood will never lose its power. Oh Lord, no never. Lord, no never. For I know that your blood it atones for my sin forever and it will never, Lord, it will never lose its power. Cuz I remember the blood and I remember your grace [Music] when you reach through the darkness. Lord, I knew I was safe [Music] and I saw your love flowing down like a fountain. You saved me by mercy. You gave me your love. I remember the blood. [Music] Oh, I remember the blood. And I remember your grace. Lord, when you reached through the darkness, well, I knew I was safe and I saw your love flowing down like a fountain. You saved me by mercy. You gave me your love. I remember the blood. [Music] [Applause] Thanks, brother John. Thankful for the blood gives us the power, the word, his spirit to change from who we were. Amen. The likeness of his his image. And that's all we really want. Amen. To be like him. And I don't want to be like me. Amen. I want to be like him. &gt;&gt; Praise God. We're going to turn to the word now as brother Biscll comes. Let's sing together. Holy words long preserved. They resound with God's own heart. Oh, let the word of God impart this morning. Amen. Holy words preserve for our in the word of God give us strength. Help us in this world where we grow. The word of God will guide us. Word of God, [Music] changing me, changing you. We have come with heart.

I'm glad he knows my name. &gt;&gt; He knows my &gt;&gt; He knows my &gt;&gt; He knows my every thought. He sees each and [Music] &gt;&gt; I have a maker. Let's sing it again. And I had a [Music] and he and even began my life in his hand. He knows my name. &gt;&gt; He knows my name. He knows my everywhere. [Music] &gt;&gt; I walk.

He can storm and make the sun shine again. I know. &gt;&gt; Let's just sing it once again. I know the master of the I He came from the stor. I know the master of &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to be acquainted with him? &gt;&gt; To know him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whom to know &gt;&gt; is life eternal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. We want to greet all the those that are streaming with us on the internet. We greet you also in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Part of the congregation here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the last two weeks, uh we just passed a million the million mark of visitors to our website. I thought that was quite remarkable and uh it's there's people who are interested, &gt;&gt; people who are being helped &gt;&gt; and we just want to be a blessing. Uh the internet may be used for a lot of very evil purposes, but we're determined to use it for a very good purpose. &gt;&gt; And let people all over the world, wherever they might be, if they feel inclined to do so, one thing for sure, it's just their own choice. they feel inclined to uh be united with us in a service and we can be of a strength to them. Praise God. &gt;&gt; We're just happy to do that. Just so happy and we feel united one with them. Amen. God's doing so many wonderful things. Uh we have a special greeting this morning to our brother Henry Hayes, Senior. Brother Henry Hayes should stand up. Uh he's a a notable man for a couple of reasons. One, he's the most senior brother that I've ever baptized. And I think that's wonderful. Baptized at 89 and today he's 90. [Applause] Yes. And I thought of the scripture, in fact, as my wife and I thought of the same scripture as soon as we were doing a little card to give our brother Hayes and says, "With long life will I satisfy him and with my salvation." I said, "You got both." You got both. A lot of people have long life, but they don't have salvation. But it's wonderful to have both. Amen. It's wonderful. Amen. Well, we will go directly to the word and I'll have you stand and turn to the book of Matthew, the 27th chapter. Also, I would like to make a couple of comments before we even turn to the scripture. Please, if you would just stay very very closely focused on the entire message this morning because uh the not only the way that I minister but uh you can't change being who you are and how you see things and and so uh you need to stay from the beginning right to the end of the message in order to really catch uh the thought. Sometimes the principles, critical principles, powerful principles are buried in very simple things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so when you see something coming in, you know, such utter simplicity, you'd think, you know, even when you read some of the things that Jesus spoke, they're they're so simple, but they're so powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're profound. And uh they're so simple they're perhaps difficult to actually lay a hold of. And brother Brandham said it's in a simplicity we go right over the top of it. See? So may God help us and help me to uh convey what uh what's on my heart this morning. Then secondly, you'll keep your Bibles close and open because I'm going to be referring to a lot of scripture. So we'll begin to read at the third verse of chapter 27. Then Judas, excuse me, please. Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? See thou to that? And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself. And the chief priest took the piece silver pieces and said, "Is it it is not lawful for to be put into the treasury because it is the price of blood." And they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field to bury strangers in. Wherefore that field was called the field of blood unto this day. And this then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, "And they took the 30 pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value, and they gave them for the potter's field as the Lord appointed me." And that 10th verse is in reference to the prophecy in the scripture. Excuse me. The ninth verse I'd like to read again. then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, "And they took the 30 pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value." Let's have a word of prayer. Dear Father, we commit this service into your hands. We pray that the mighty Holy Spirit will just take charge of everyone's thoughts and minds and pray dear Lord the thing that you would like to convey will be powerfully brought to the hearts of each individual. Anoint us for service Lord. Anoint me, oh God, I pray. anoint the people and all who will listen and hear this service and be benefited by it. We pray and I desire Lord that people will move higher and love you in a realm in a dimension that they have not yet attained. May there be something of depth oh God something that goes beyond words and beyond emotion. May it be something oh God that is for eternal in the name of Jesus Christ we ask. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. I want to speak on the value of him. That's why I read the ninth verse twice. And he's not someone who was just 2,000 years ago. The value of him that is present, the value of him that has been revealed, the value of the son of man as was revealed according to Luke 17:30. And we, you, I happen to be living at that very moment when he, the living Christ, is just as real today in word form as he was then in flesh form. &gt;&gt; And I wonder how we value him. Value is to estimate or to fix a value to have in honor or to revere to hold in reverence but more specifically for today's service to make an estimation to look at something make an estimation and place a certain value and say it's worth that. Once you've established a value, then you can also think about what you would give in exchange for that if you needed to give something in exchange. The value of him, there's a vast difference in a set of values. Vast difference. A value is a very very relative word. It goes from one pole to the other. You've heard the term somebody's junk is somebody's treasure. That's what all these garage sales and flea markets and collectible stores and stuff. It's what it's all about. Some lose interest in things that they one time thought was so valuable and occupied a prominent place in their home. And as time went on, it uh went from the home to the basement and from the basement to the garage and from the garage to the dump. But it was really valuable. One day I remember when uh I remember I began to see things that became popular in the old chrome furniture with the buttons on the vinyl chairs and I thought I threw that to the garbage and here people are giving their eye teeth for it. I thought my goodness I should have saved all that junk. We've all gone through that. And the world world is full of stories of people that had possessions and they they they cared for and they treasured for years only to find that it was worthless. Some have thought that they've had, you know, something that was priceless and then they find out it wasn't worth anything. There's been people who thought they had original art hanging on the wall only to find out it was a fraud. &gt;&gt; They thought it was worth millions and treated it like it was worth millions and it wasn't worth anything. And then there are others who have accumulations of stuff that has either been handed down or has been collected over a lifetime. and they discover one day that a discarded item was very valuable. I was in one of our family's homes of this church or here today and I walked in and and I said, "That's a that's a nice painting." Oh, is it? Yeah. I said, "That's a nice painting. That's a well-known artist." It is? Yeah. Where'd you get it? Well, it was, you know, my mother gave it to me. They didn't know what was hanging on the wall. I didn't tell them was hanging on the wall. They might have gone and sold it and bought a car or some other worthless thing. You've all heard and read you that have read the message. We read about the little boy with the stamp, you know, and he ends up and he sells it for a dollar and goes buy some ice cream or something and then next time it was sold for thousands and thousands of dollars. It wasn't the wasn't the size of it. what was on it. So there's a vast vast difference array of evaluation and I don't want to stay on that but we have heard many times that you never really fully appreciate what you have until it's gone. And especially when it comes to our family, our friends, we have someone and then they move away or God takes them and maybe we never put a whole lot of maybe they weren't very visible, never said a whole lot and then we find out really what what it is that we're missing and what it was that we had and we weren't able to really appreciate it. And there has to be some formula to evaluate things. You have to have some comparison or something that is that you can relate to. There are people for example employees in a corporation and they can be one is considered extremely valuable. They're valuable for their skills. They're valuable for what they contribute to the company. They're valuable because they perhaps contribute a great deal to the profitability of the company. The company's successful because of this individual and their business acumen or skills or whatever they call it. And then another person may be very valuable, considered valuable because they have uh management skills or they have technical skills or whatever more. They're they're just extremely valuable to the company. And so there are so many ways that they have a formula to value. The scripture says, "What is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" Quite frankly, I think there's a a lot of us, I say us, I include myself in the in the message. I really believe we need to have a refocusing of what is truly valuable. &gt;&gt; I really do. I believe that Satan has been successful at bluffing the population of the earth and it creeps in even amongst believers and it's hard for us to keep our focus and to really see what's valuable, &gt;&gt; what truly is valuable because it has so many flashing lights and things out there and enticements and enchantments and all kinds of things. and you reach for this and reach for that. And when you get a hold of it, you find out it was just a bubble &gt;&gt; and it wasn't really worth all the time we spent, all the energy we spent. And and after all, when it's all done, what have you got? You find out you're just hanging on to some ashes and it just dissipates out of your hands and is gone. what is truly valuable. You know, it's amazing. I find that when I'm studying often little things cross my pathway or someone sends me a little something and every once in a while, Brother Ernie just sends me a little note. And this wasn't even the major part of his note, but at the bottom he just had a little something and it says this. Do not value the things you have in your life, but value who you have in your life. &gt;&gt; And I thought that was very important. Do not value the things you have in your life, but value who you have in your life. Now we are here today because we have someone in our life. We have something in common. We have a Christ, a living Christ that's been made known to us through a message. And we have that in common. We have a person. &gt;&gt; He's the man. the man &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. I've been speaking about him. So have others been speaking about him. And as believers of the message, one thing we know, we know. Would you agree with me? &gt;&gt; One thing we know that we're living in the days we sing. These are the days of Elijah. Well, these are the days of the son of man. These are the days. And in a different way, we could say, well, that's been all true all down through history, but not at this level of understanding. Not at this level. They didn't have a message like this back in the days of the martyr, the ox age. They didn't have it in the man age. Didn't have it even not very many years ago. But we have it today. &gt;&gt; We can say we know him. whom to know as life eternal. Just beyond the range of your vision this morning, just beyond the range of this physical eyesight is this man. This person has feelings. He's touched with the feelings of our infirmity. Far more sensitive than we could be. knows more about us, knows more the beginning to the ending, knows all of that. He's watching, has eyes, ears to hear. &gt;&gt; He's here. He's present. &gt;&gt; He has come in that. And that was the purpose of the ministry of a prophet ministry. He couldn't do it without that. And that's why that ministry also has become very dear, priceless, valuable. &gt;&gt; Couldn't happen another way. It had to happen this way. &gt;&gt; This was the chosen way. This was the foretold way. This was the ordained way. This was the predestinated way. There was no other way. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message concerned and convinced, Brother Brandham makes this statement and I'm going to take one phrase which I'll repeat when I'm done. I'm convinced he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. I'm convinced in the ministry and the message I'm preaching. I am convinced that it's the truth. I'm convinced that these visions come from God. I'm convinced we're living in the last days. I'm convinced that this very spirit that's on you now is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Glory." And I can say, "Glory." And we should all say, "Glory." &gt;&gt; We're convinced of that. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm thoroughly convinced. I'm convinced that the Holy Ghost way is right. I'm convinced that the Bible way is the truth. I'm convinced." And here's the line. I'm convinced that this is Jesus Christ here now. &gt;&gt; I'm convinced that this is Jesus Christ here now. The same Jesus Christ that Judas looked on. &gt;&gt; The same Jesus Christ that he evaluated. The same Jesus Christ that the nation of Israel looked on, watched him, studied him, heard him, weighed out his words, thought about his message, put everything on a scale of evaluation, made an estimation, said he's worth 30 pieces of silver. I'm convinced this is Jesus Christ right now. here. Now, I'm convinced if we believe him at this minute, I'm convinced that he'll heal every sick person in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. Oh, it's wonderful to have that kind of confidence. I'm convinced that he'll heal every sick person right now in the twinkling of an eye. &gt;&gt; This isn't a quote. &gt;&gt; This is him. I'm convinced that he'd pour the Holy Ghost upon here till there'd be such a shout till hard to tell what would take place that I'm convinced. So I asked the question, how do you value him? And what formula do we have? We're going to read in a moment, but don't turn to it just yet. In Matthew 26, the chapter just before the one we read our text from in Matthew 26, Jesus arrives at Bethany. And actually, he arrives six days before the Passover. And the Passover was the pass his last Passover when he would be crucified. So he's coming to a very serious critical time. Before him is the garden of Gethsemane, the last supper, the betrayal, the crucifixion, and his death. All of that is just days ahead of him. And in uh Matthew 26, it's also related in John the 12th chapter. John tells more than Matthew certain details. And Matthew 26 starts two days before the Passover. And the chief priests are now they're very wound up about getting Jesus off the scene and destroying him and killing him. And they have gone to the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest, and they're consulting between themselves. How can we get him? How can we take him subtly? We need a plan to get a to get him and to destroy him. And so they have they have gone to Caiaphas's palace. And now Jesus becomes Jesus is invited to Simon the leper's house for supper. And at the supper is Martha, Mary, and Lazarus who had been raised from the dead. And that they're at Simon the leper's house. Mary is not named in Matthew 26, but she's named in John's gospel. She's called Mary of Bethany for Jesus has come to Bethany. And now we'll read from Matthew 26 from the sixth verse. And I'll make some comments as we proceed. Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, there came unto him a woman who I said now is Mary of Bethany, sister of Lazarus and Martha, having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat. Now you can just look this way if you would for a moment. This isn't only uh a very unusual thing to happen but it's at a very unusual time and you have to understand that when someone does something of an unusual nature uh e even the the act is unusual but then when they do it at a very unusual time almost could be considered an o awkward time he's sitting at meat and she's driven there's something within her. She just has to do this and she takes and breaks this alabaster box and pours it over his head. And there's indignation amongst the disciples. In fact, as John now mentions the disciple, it was Judas that was had become indignant. But this alabaster box, it was considered to be the very best material to preserve ointments, the very best. So she had the very best that she had. Brother Brandham said she'd probably earned it through a life of prostitution. And she has it in the very best of a of a container that it'll be that it'll be um maintained. It's it's precious. Perhaps it's because of its scent or its smell and its consistency or whatever more. And this was the very best container that we had. And she had kept this and preserved this and had bought this with the monies that she had earned. And now she sees this one who has brought her into this glorious experience with him, raised her brother from the dead, and now they're having a supper. She doesn't know anything about Calvary. She doesn't know anything about the suffering, what's going to happen in the next hours, but she's driven. &gt;&gt; Let me say something. Neither do you know what's going to happen just ahead. Neither do we know just a moment that we'll be caught away. We don't know anything about the rapture except a few words, but we're we're here to experience some incredible things. And as she was and she broke the box, poured the oil over his head while he's sitting for dinner eating supper. And the and the disciples have a reaction. And Judas speaks up and why was this waste? Why is this wasted like this? This could have been sold for 300 pants and it could have been given to the poor. And the scripture says not because he cared for the poor but because he was a thief. That's what was motivating his reaction. And then Jesus said this, "She's anointed me for my burial." She knew nothing about the burial. &gt;&gt; She knew nothing about all this event, but she knew she was being driven by the spirit of the word because it had to be in the word. And this will be told for memorial for her throughout all generations. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the disciples saw it, verse 8, they had indignation saying, "To what purpose is this waste?" There can be some very, very spiritual things. Get me now. Spiritual things can be considered a waste. They can appear to be a waste, a waste of time, &gt;&gt; a waste of energy, a waste of strength, a waste of money. &gt;&gt; Remember, you cannot have the evaluation of the world &gt;&gt; and apply it to spiritual things. &gt;&gt; People worry about maybe the tithe that they give, the tenth that they give, and worry about that. And perhaps there's those here that don't give it at all. It's not your money. You're not giving anything. &gt;&gt; It's God's money. And furthermore, it's the best investment you can ever make. &gt;&gt; You got money sitting in a CD or in some uh certificate in a bank. I can tell you it's going downhill &gt;&gt; just by inflation. But what you put to the Lord's work and isn't it marvelous? I have such a liberty because we're not taking an offering. We're not trying to pull anything out of your pocket. I'm trying to tell you what we have is an evaluation in God's word. And &gt;&gt; I'm not telling you that God's going to bless you and God's going to do this and God that's the wrong motivation. But I can tell you I've had people come into this congregation, get saved and come and counel with me and said, "We can't afford to give. We've here here it is." And they had it all written out. They had their income and at the bottom they're at a negative. They said, "How can we pay our tithes?" I said, "You know, it's God's business. It's not for me to tell you. &gt;&gt; That's what the word says. He says, "We're going to start paying our tithes." They came to me 2, three months later. They said, "We have an absolute miracle." And furthermore, it doesn't even make it doesn't even make mathematical sense. We've been paying our tithes, paying all our bills, and we've got $200 left over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God's got more ways. &gt;&gt; He owns the cattle on a thousand hills. He doesn't need our filthy lucer. But it's it's our benefit that we are able to give to God's work. Not only give of money, but give of our time, give of our home, give of our service, give and be be hospitable. Amen. Look for ways to bless. When you find those people around the church, you young people, you set those young, you set those folks, those families, those couples, you set them as an example &gt;&gt; and seek to follow that example. Why are you quiet? &gt;&gt; Open your door. Open your heart. &gt;&gt; Open your house. Open your pocketbook. Open up everything. Say, "God, it's not mine. It's all yours. My life is yours." If you live for yourself, you lose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What you're holding tight, you've already lost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You couldn't bind me up if you tried. I feel such liberty here today. I might even take an offering. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be a shock? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And for this ointment, verse n, for this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. And when Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? For she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you, but me you have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this that this woman, this woman hath done, we be told for a memorial for her. Then one of the twel called Judas a scariot went unto the chief priests and said unto them, "What will you give me?" And I will deliver him unto you. And they covenanted with him for 30 pieces of silver. And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. We have two individuals, one man and one woman. And this is an extreme paradox. One woman feels that this person is worth absolutely everything &gt;&gt; that I have &gt;&gt; and everything that I have ever earned. everything my entire life which is wrapped up in this alabaster box. I'll just pour it on his head. It may look like a total waste and it will be gone. I can never collect it again. My whole life savings are gone. But this moment demands it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is the value of this moment. and I must do it. And here's another man who's seen the miracles, who has participated in the ministry, who sat in the message church and sat with not only the prophet but the God prophet &gt;&gt; and saw the miracles and was part of it and went preaching the gospel and saw and participated in that great ministry and came back rejoicing. And he views the entire life and all the events and comes up with a value that 30 pieces of silver will be sufficient for me to betray him. Brother Brandham said, "God's gifts always find their place." This woman brought this myrr and anointed that anointed costly something to take the smell of death away. She certainly didn't know that. She didn't know she broke the alabaster box. This is going to take the smell of death away. It's a simple thing. She broke the alabaster box and poured it upon the head of Jesus. And Judas said, "Why was this ought to have been given to the poor, not that he had respect for the poor, but he was a thief to begin with?" He carried the money. Said, "This ought put it." Jesus said, "Let her alone, for she did this. She anointed him onto his burial. This woman was grateful. Now, I have this. Here's the highlighted part. This woman was grateful that her sins were forgiven &gt;&gt; until she spent her all her money she had and took an alabaster box and broke it and poured the oil and just ordered the room with fine smell of this myrr that she had anointed him for his death. And now see, she did the service not knowing what she was doing, but she was so grateful to God. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, folks. You're not just hearing a sermon. There's enough people in here today with the very presence of God and the experience that you've had, you can look upon it. You can see it within you. You can say, "This is so priceless. This is so precious. I'm going to let I'm going to let the order of this experience fill this place. &gt;&gt; I'm going to affect others. Going to influence them by the life and the association and the relationship and the love that I have. It will be visible. &gt;&gt; Others will see it. &gt;&gt; She wasn't doing it to be seen. She wasn't doing it to be somebody. She was doing it because she was releasing the love she had. And the love that we have in our heart has to go a lot further than singing a song. &gt;&gt; I love him. I love him. And sometimes it's even hard to get people to open their mouth and to sing and to worship. I say we ought to be absolutely liberated to express what we have in our hearts for God. &gt;&gt; You won't scare me &gt;&gt; if you raise your voice &gt;&gt; and scream a praise to the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; You won't scare me or anyone else &gt;&gt; if you shouted out, "I love him." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll do somebody some good &gt;&gt; if you get carried away &gt;&gt; with something that's in your heart. And then it was what we read. Judas that betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned. One place brother Brandon was saying he didn't really expect it to happen like that. When he saw he was condemned he saw you know sometimes God help me. Sometimes we have some little idea. Sometime we have some thought, sometime we have some personal opinion or personal characteristic within our family or within the church or within where you work or whatever more. We have some little thing and we hold it and it's so dear and we hold it so tight and we can cause such a fuss over it and then when all is said and done, it doesn't mean anything. &gt;&gt; It's not worth two cents. &gt;&gt; But to us, it's so priceless. &gt;&gt; But when we think of It can come down to any area of our life. As as as believers, you hear it preached, we ought to dress a certain way. You say, "Well, it's so hard. so hard to change or I mentioned once here in the church just a oneliner about women's skirts with a zipper in front. I never had such an uproar. Never had such an uproar over a oneline statement in the church. And I had some, you know, I never even expected to ever hear a remark about it ever, but I had some that contact me said, "I went home and I cleaned out my closet and I just got rid of them." I had others that said, "You can't find it in the word of God and you can't find it in the message." And and there the zipper became important, &gt;&gt; really valuable. But when all is said and done, what does it mean? Nothing. &gt;&gt; But who are you affecting? Who are you influencing? &gt;&gt; Is it got brownie points to the plus side? Is this, you know, is this the way that I'm intending or the way that I'm determined to, you know, conduct myself or whatever more? Is it is it influencing people into a spiritual dimension and a relationship? Are are you doing something for the Lord or is it for oursel? Oh, I made a point. Oh, I want a disciple. &gt;&gt; Great. You got a disciple. You got somebody on your side. You got somebody that agrees with you. I say &gt;&gt; that's all it means. Just nothing. Good. I've got a long time yet. &gt;&gt; Not really. How can we ever or we can never fully comprehend how great men of the scripture, men living honorable lives, men living a life that the prophet said you couldn't put a finger on their life. How could they ever come up and with even an inclination within them? We need to kill this man. &gt;&gt; This isn't these aren't light words. &gt;&gt; These are great, spiritually admired and honored men. Actually having a a meeting. How can we not how can we do away with this man and and send him to another place or how can we just you know remove his influence but how can we kill him how can we destroy him how can we subtly do this and in that meeting they're actually making an evaluation and how could Jesus accompany how could Judas accompany Jesus and take part of the ministry and betray him the scripture says that he may take part of this ministry, an apostilhip because they chose another another one that would take Judas's apostilhip from which Judas by transgression fell. And here's why he did it. That he might go to his own place. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about the four that died at Calvary, &gt;&gt; the son of God and the son of predition and one thief. The Bible says that Judas went out and hung himself. The son of God on one tree, the son of predition on another tree with the thief. One thief saw something said, "Lord, remember me &gt;&gt; when you come into your kingdom." He saw he saw something that the disciples on the ground failed to see. &gt;&gt; They saw the kingdom crumbling. He saw it coming into power. &gt;&gt; He never saw the first pulls. never saw the second pull, never heard the third pull, but he had a revelation of who it was that was gasping his last breath beside him. Lord, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. When you come into your kingdom, remember me. That's all. &gt;&gt; Today, you'll be with me in paradise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the other son of predition died on a tree also and took the other one, cursing his way to hell. And the prophet said, "The son of predition came from hell and went to hell. &gt;&gt; And the son of God came from heaven and went to heaven." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're in the midst of a incredible experience. Friends, you have a short life. Remember, you're not going to go this way again. You have a very short life. Wait till you get to my age. You find out how fast it went. Amen. &gt;&gt; You that are young and you that have your youth. And my oh how I would love to be in my teens again and be able to start give youth and my strength &gt;&gt; to this one and pour out something that would be fragrant upon his name. &gt;&gt; How I would be careful not to bring marks against this message. I like to live such an honorable way so that people could look and find a beacon light &gt;&gt; beaming out. &gt;&gt; People that love God, people that are stable, people who consider the message worth more than anything else in life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometime people get their eyes on what God pours in. I tell you what, God pours in so we can pour out. So we can bless the bride of Jesus Christ with whatever we have or whatever God puts in our hands. Judas saw and walked with the word in flesh form. And I want to superimpose upon your minds. You are walking with the same word, the same Christ in word form. And there is no difference. The word was made flesh and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; And now the now he he has been made word, revealed word and dwells among us. &gt;&gt; Our heart our hands have handled. Our eyes have looked upon him. &gt;&gt; God himself in word form in the second coming message. Brother Brandham said, "It's God's infallible, eternal, everpresent word." And frankly, it's God himself living in word form. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; It's God himself. God has fills all time and space. God has funneled himself down and has come into word form. &gt;&gt; I wonder if Judas could actually grasp. I don't believe that he could. I don't believe that he did. that this one that he was actually walking with and could see his hands and perhaps see the veins in his hands and see him as he studied him as he took the bread and broke the bread and took the fishes and and and and saw him and saw him got tired and saw him asleep in the boat. I doubt that he actually could grasp in his heart what is in him created the ground I'm standing on. What is in him caused this wheat to grow that I'm eating this bread from? I doubt if he'd grasp that. I prayed and I'm praying that even now that somehow your minds will be illuminated that this is not just a message. This isn't just something we say brother Brandham said. This isn't just that. This has been a divinelyapp appointed servant that there could be no other way had to come at this time. And God knew that you'd be born in the day you're born. He knew you'd be breathing his free air and in his sunshine at this certain time. He knew that you'd be sitting exactly where you are, hearing exactly what you're hearing and having some little uh preacher tell you it's a living Christ alive present here now. The same one &gt;&gt; that the woman appraised &gt;&gt; as being worth more than all she had. It's the same one that Judas appraised for 30 pieces of silver and the nation of Israel. The value of him whom they valued. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; And the infallible word of God said, "The reason I rest my faith upon this word because I believe it to be the word of God." And then if it is the word of God, it's God himself in word form. &gt;&gt; And then in the invisible union, just exactly he said like the grain that went into the ground in the ground. The same Jesus Christ in the bride form, same power, same church, same thing, same word. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; It's the same Jesus Christ, the same God has written word. The word became flesh. That was Jesus Christ. That same Jesus Christ now has come in word form in a generation that is an intellectual generation, a cultured generation. He came in word form, &gt;&gt; but it's still him. Exactly. Precisely him. &gt;&gt; They could pour physical oil on him. You can pour the oil of your life upon him. You can pour the oil of your of what God has given you. You can pour it upon him. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, those earnings were from her sinful life. The very body that you have was born in sin and shapen iniquity." But here, it's become a vessel that you can actually contain something to pour it out upon him, the word, this Christ, this message &gt;&gt; and all that it represents. As much as you've done it to one of the least of these, my brethren, you've done it unto me. &gt;&gt; When you give that cup of cold water, when you sisters are doing the dishes, that same Lord Jesus looking at you, you're doing those dishes for him. You served him. You served someone. You served the believers. You served your family. You served your husband. You brethren that are out working, you're laboring. You say, "What is this all about?" You're laboring for one. There's only one purpose in life. Everything else Everything else is ashes and worthless. And please tell me what this bucket of ashes is worth. It's worth nothing. Unless we use it only as a as a tool, as an instrument. We have an evaluation. We say, "If I can do this, praise God, then I can do that. I can support my home. I can have a place where I can have people. I can witness to them. I can speak to them. This is my whole life. This is what I breathe for. &gt;&gt; Don't sit and just look at me today. I want you to say, "I'm getting it, brother Ed. &gt;&gt; I'm getting it. &gt;&gt; I'm getting the message. I'm understanding. I'm getting it. By God's grace, I want to pour myself into it. And I want to pour myself upon the very head of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So it's Jesus Christ. You believe everything else. Brother Brandham said, "Let's believe this. It's Jesus Christ in bride form." &gt;&gt; You're sitting beside him. &gt;&gt; You're sitting beside him today. This isn't some poetic license. You're sitting beside him. &gt;&gt; This is him. &gt;&gt; This is the bride. &gt;&gt; This is him &gt;&gt; in bride form. &gt;&gt; No different. It's the same one that Judas looked on. &gt;&gt; Let's not sell out one another. Let's not discredit one another. &gt;&gt; This is him. &gt;&gt; And you'll never have another Christ that you can pour your life out on. He's not going to come your way physically for you to pour oil on. He's here now. This is your chance. &gt;&gt; Don't ever forget it. &gt;&gt; If I leave the scene, don't ever forget this. This is your day. &gt;&gt; This is your chance. Don't miss it. &gt;&gt; I challenge you young men. I challenge you people. Don't miss this opportunity. Each of us must make our estimation and place a value accordingly. Moses looked, Brother Brandham said, through the same window that Pharaoh looked through. When Pharaoh looked through the window, he said, "Look at those mudbers. Look at these slaves I have. Look at what they're building for me. I got this entire nation under my control. A bunch of slaves, worthless slaves." Moses came up to the window. &gt;&gt; He said, "They're God's seed. &gt;&gt; They're God's chosen. These are the children of God. These are the people that are holding a promise. &gt;&gt; Both of them looked out the same window. Both of them had a totally different evaluation of what it was they were seeing. Wasn't just Moses. Thank God for the message. Brother Brandham said it was God. It was God, Christ in Moses. &gt;&gt; It was Christ and Moses that saw things the way he saw them. He said he looked he looked at the unseen. I love this. So Moses when he looked out the window, he was looking at the unseen. This is what he saw. He saw the years that were coming ahead. Oh my, I'm so touched. I'm just praying God to help me through the rest of this service. I've been waiting for this moment to come and preach to you. He said he saw Egypt destroyed. &gt;&gt; I wonder if God could give you that eyesight. every person here today when you go to your place of work and endeavor tomorrow. I pray that God will give you eyesight that you'll see this world destroyed. &gt;&gt; Fire &gt;&gt; is hanging in the heavens. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that this elements will melt with fervent heat &gt;&gt; and Moses saw Egypt destroyed. And furthermore, brother Brandham said Moses saw when he was standing over Egypt walking in the palatial palaces of the superpower of the earth. &gt;&gt; He said he saw Egypt as they are today. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what he says in this clock. &gt;&gt; He saw Egypt as they are today. Oh God, help us &gt;&gt; to see this lesson age that we're in as God sees it. &gt;&gt; All this fine things and all these fine homes and all these fine automobiles and all of this luxury. Let's see it as God sees it. &gt;&gt; God give you eyesight today that you'll see it's worthless. It's ashes. Yes, we must have it. We must we must do our conduct our affairs in a stewardship manner. But we can we we can deal with this world as God sees it &gt;&gt; and see it as God sees it. &gt;&gt; Get all you can, learn all you can, and give all you can. &gt;&gt; I'm not asking you to remain ignores. &gt;&gt; Don't go to school. That's all I'm saying. Get all the education you can if that's how God leads you. Earn all you can. Give all you can. &gt;&gt; Be all you can. He saw Egypt as she is today. He saw Israel. Now this takes quite some eyesight friends. In fact is this takes a greater uh capacity of eyesight than I'm asking that God give you today. He looked on people. You haven't seen them. You haven't seen any of these people here stomping in mud and straw squeezing between their toes. You haven't seen them each other. You haven't seen that. Maybe you've seen each other in work clothes or seen each other in in our school or studies or whatever more. He saw them trampling in the mud. And when he saw them, the prophet of God says he saw them comfortably in the bosom of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. If you could look around this congregation today and see the bride member of Jesus Christ that's beside you in this body called the body of Jesus Christ. I wish that God would give you eyesight that you could see that person comfortably in the bosom of God in the other land. If you could see them in the rapture, &gt;&gt; how valuable that person that's beside you. You see them in a rapture. You see them in a glorified body. &gt;&gt; Oh, God help me. That's the kind of eyesight you need in order to live the way we ought to live. &gt;&gt; In order to interact the way we ought to interact. &gt;&gt; We see them in the bosom of God. &gt;&gt; We see them glorified. &gt;&gt; It will take away the humanity. says he saw them comfortably seated around Abraham in glory. When I read that, I said, "God, we need that. &gt;&gt; We need that. I need that. You need that. The church needs it. Believers of the message around the world need that. They need to see one another seated comfortably in heaven in the bosom of God. Uh we need to see each other that way &gt;&gt; in glory &gt;&gt; and by faith he chose to take the worst the worst the religion could give him and he compared it he estimated it with the best that the world could give him. Moses looked at the very worst that religion could give him and he compared it with the very best that the world could give him and he chose to suffer the reproach of Christ and considered it a greater treasure than all of Egypt could offer or afford to give him because he endured as seeing him who was invisible. And don't think that just as a phrase if you want to endure. And there's a lot of folks that don't endure. But we need people that will endure. You're this way today. You're victorious today. You're victorious tomorrow. Say, "How do I have that kind of life?" It depends what you're looking at. &gt;&gt; And if you see what I'm talking about today, you live a different kind of life. &gt;&gt; And you will endure. I haven't got time but the gentile warriors of David believe brother Vin was probably the first I remember hearing just mentioning the gentile warriors because he spoke quite a bit about it but the gentile warriors of David it wasn't just what they saw but on the other hand they were associated with someone who was rejected someone who was running for his life. Someone who appeared to be defeated, but they knew that he'd been anointed as king. &gt;&gt; And so that's what they that's what they kept their eyes on. They knew he had been anointed as king. The the prophet said his own people kicked him out and they didn't want nothing to do with him. Saul ran him out. The head of the denomination kicked him out. have nothing to do with him. The council kicked him out and he became a fugitive. They had to go wherever they could. I wonder if we were in some warehouse. Hello. If we were in some warehouse and we never had, you know, the grand piano, but maybe something with the ivory off of the keys and maybe a little out of tune and you weren't sitting where you're sitting today, but you were sitting on some hard seats and you had a tough time at the border and you had a flat tire coming to church and you came from Chilowak or you came from the Northshore in Vancouver and you had difficult coming here and all the rest of it and then you're sitting here. I wonder if we were just in a warehouse, would we all be here? &gt;&gt; Why do you say that? Because I'm preaching on the value. &gt;&gt; The value of him. &gt;&gt; Is he worth it? I'm trying to work to a closing, but now I come to the most critical spot in Isaiah 53. Don't turn to it. I'll just speak from it because I like your attention. Now in Isaiah 53, it starts out and I just begin to see this in such powerful such a powerful way. Who has believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? Four. Now he begins to give out the description. How can anybody believe this report? Who's going to believe this report? For he comes up out of the ground, out of dry ground as a tender plant out of dry ground. And he's rejected. He's esteemed of God. He's afflicted. He's acquainted with grief and sorrows and we all hid our face as it were from him. Who's going to believe that this is the son of God? Who's going to believe this one came from heaven? Who's going to believe he's going to be the atonement and redemption will be accomplished through him? Who's going to associate theirel with him? And there's no place in the entire chapter of of Isaiah 53, the prophecy, entire prophecy of Jesus Christ. There's no place to polish him up. &gt;&gt; There's no place to make him more palatable. &gt;&gt; There's no place to make him nicer. &gt;&gt; No place to make him more popular or accepted to the world. &gt;&gt; He is rejected. He has been rejected and he's still rejected. This is him. I can't stop speaking about him. He's gripped and captivated by life. He shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry dry ground. He hath no form nor calmliness. And calmliness is he has no splendor. He has no glory. He has no honor. He has no majesty. Who's going to believe this report? Who's going to believe this message is really what it is? Oh, it gathers an accumulation of people, but do they really know it's him? &gt;&gt; Him. And when we we shall see him, when you see him, there is no beauty. There is no beauty and there's no way to make him beautiful. &gt;&gt; I've saved a long article. I won't even get into it now, but they just had, you know, the anniversary of Princess Diana's death. And everybody had different thought about it. And I don't read, I don't get a newspaper other than what is scattered at my door. But it was when I was away and someone in Europe wrote about how the world has caught up with her death and this anniversary and the commercialization of it. And they said this generation is a is gripped by a beauty cult. everything. I won't say everything, but so much of it, billions and billions and billions of dollars could feed, I'm sure, the entire poor world with what is spent on beauty products &gt;&gt; and the operations and the cosmetic surgeries and all that takes place to reshape the body and reshape the face and to make things more more wonderful and more beautiful. And this man who I'm sure has no spiritual direction is not coming from a spiritual direction identifies a whole generation as a generation of people gripped with the beauty cult. &gt;&gt; You talk about a lot of cults and people call this a cult. I'll tell you those that are gripped with this whole beauty business, that's a cult &gt;&gt; and it's a lie. &gt;&gt; And it's taking people to hell &gt;&gt; and it's making them something that they aren't. They're not that. &gt;&gt; They put on all expensive garments and shape their bodies in a certain way and all kinds of this idol and that idol and whatever. It is idolatry. &gt;&gt; Absolutely idolatry. The magazines are full of it. The newspaper's full of it. Everything's full of it. It's all a beauty cult. &gt;&gt; But there's no beauty in him. &gt;&gt; And we can't make him beautiful. But yet to us as a believer, we say as a bride in the Song of Solomon that, "Oh, he's more wonderful." &gt;&gt; 10,000 times 10,000. Can't compare with him. He's all together lovely. &gt;&gt; Do you see him that way? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? These are simple things, but that is why I just get so moved. And on the tape, I hear I can actually see it visibly. Brother Brand, I'm standing there and a woman comes up and in that presence, he just utters quietly, "Isn't he lovely? Oh God, how how how could the Lord Jesus stand by and not give that woman what she had need of when two people meet and that servant that knows him so well, doesn't have to preach her a sermon. He just says, "Isn't he lovely?" friends, if I never preach another service, quite frankly, I'm weary. I don't I don't I don't have a fondness. I don't have any itch to preach. I'd like to just go and spend time with him because he's lovely. &gt;&gt; He's altogether lovely. I would like to convey that to you. Don't go out these doors and forget that. You say, "Well, Brother Ed, yeah, you're an old white-haired man." Just let me tell you something. Some of my most precious times that I had in my life was when I was in my teens. And what he is tonight, he was then. I saw him in the flowers. I saw him in the trees. Brother Brandham talks of hearing his voice in the wind of the trees. It's simple, isn't it? But try to get that try to get into that atmosphere down in Vancouver or in the mall or at Bellis Fair. You won't find it there. He's despised. He's rejected of men. He's a man of sorrows. He's acquainted with grief. And we hid, as it were, our faces from him. He's despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. And when we saw him, there was no beauty. Do you know why? You were looking at your own sorrow and your own grief and your own sin. And there's no way it could be lovely. He was carrying your life. &gt;&gt; He was carrying your penalty. &gt;&gt; There's no way for it to be attractive. &gt;&gt; He was oppressed. He was afflicted. And he opened not his mouth. He wasn't He didn't have a command of his vocabulary. Listen, this is the same Jesus Christ. This isn't a story. This isn't just a prophecy. This is the one who you say you love and you serve. This is him. &gt;&gt; And he can't be anything else. &gt;&gt; Are you weary with my preaching? &gt;&gt; Are you getting a hold of what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; And it pleased the Lord to bruise him and put him to grief. You shall make his soul when thou hast made his soul an offering for sin. My sin, your sin. The atmosphere is right. The Holy Spirit is present. He's saying things to each one of us in a a personal way. And I ask you, what value is this man? What value is he? The Bible tells us, and I'll go quickly, Samuel was rejected. But when God spoke to Samuel, he said, "It's not you, it's me they rejected." God has always expressed himself in his chosen vessels, prophets, kings. David was spit on. Christ was spit on. He prophet said it was Christ and David. So David was spit on. David had dust cast on him. It was Christ. They cast dust on him. Tore his beard out. God always expressed himself in the people. The Apostle Paul said, "From henceforth, let no man trouble me. For I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus." Not my marks, not the church's marks, the marks of the Lord Jesus. Those are his marks. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus expressing himself in his people. Now I come to a part that is most important to me. I said and I thank you for your very kind attention. Brother Brandham in life story and there's an there's a an entire piece big segment of brother Brandham's life and up to today perhaps you have thought it's part of his life story or this is part of his experience and it was but God didn't only allow God ordained that he would have that experience in order that he could be the vessel that he had to be for the people to whom he had to come and to the message he had to carry. &gt;&gt; God allowed his prophets he expressed himself in the prophets. Brother Brandham's life was shattered completely shattered when his young wife Hope passed away. And then within a few hours, his eight-month-old baby Sharon, he calls Sherry, and he prayed and he cried, "God, don't take her. Don't take her." And his prayer sound like it went nowhere. God knew what he was doing. But he was taking that young man and just crushing and tearing the soul as it were right out of him and he describes it after she died and said God wouldn't hear him and it was like the devil spoke to him said this God doesn't hear you says I went home. I stayed with mama that day and that night I was going around to the house and I picked up the mail. Doesn't it sound ordinary? It's about the same as Jesus going to supper at Simon the leper's house. It's very ordinary. I went to mama's house. His life is the world has come to a complete end. says, "As soon as I went there, the little old room there, little stove, little old cot. I stayed right there at the home. I didn't want to go nowhere else. There wasn't very much there. that little he says that old furniture but she and I live together with it. Now he's making a comparison. He's making an evaluation. The objects he's looking at are probably worth nothing. He's had to live in utter utter poverty. A little cot, little stove, little bit of old furniture. And he found a little envelope and on it was Sherry and in it was 85 cents that she had put away wanting to buy her something, I believe, for Christmas. And he saw those things said, "God, I can't live. I just can't live. I can't go on. There's nothing left. Let me go. Let me die." Is in that frame of mind. And he says, "But these things here, we live together with it and it was ours. People can think what they wish to think about this word about this Christ that I'm I'm not speaking about something that's beautified and we got fine things and all that. Forget that. There's all ashes. Everything that you brothers up in the video room and all the rest of it, just remember there's just bunch of ashes. What is this worth if we don't have a relationship? I'm talking about a relationship that's gripping, a relationship that's deep. &gt;&gt; And when he looked at these things, he gave the actual the heart and the essence of this message this morning. He said it was it was a whole lot. Now he said three things. He said three things. She and I lived here together with it. And it was ours. Number two. It was a whole lot. And he says this words. It ain't the value of anything. It's the way you look at it. Moses looked, he saw one thing. Pharaoh looked, he saw something else. Judas looked, he saw something worth 30 pieces of silver. The safe prostitute looked and saw something worth her entire life. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you, if she'd have had more ointment, she'd have poured it on him. She just was impelled, compelled to do this. And he says the angels came and had taken her away. Speaking of her little daughter, says he packed her down, put her in the arms of her mother. I went out there and I heard the undertaker say, "Ashes to ashes and dust to dust and earth to earth." And as the old clay clouds dropped upon the little casket, and the breeze came down through the trees, it seemed to say, "There's a land beyond the river that they call the sweet forever, and we only reach the shore by faith degree. One by one we'll gain the portal there to dwell with the immortal. Someday when they ring the golden bells for you and me. We're all going to be there one day. And everything that has seemed so important and so valuable. I just wonder if we'll have that moment of regret and that twinge. Why did I waste so much of my energy and my time to build something that is for not? &gt;&gt; It took a crushing to bring these attributes out. Now listen close as I come to a close. I frankly believe that that was God because now there was another father and he had a place and he had prepared it and he put his son in it. Adam and Eve and death swept him. death crept in and tore them out of his bosom, tore them out of his fellowship, tore them out of his arms. There was no more fellowship. There was no more communion. It was gone. It was it was a a just a incredibly indescribable just a relentless effort of Satan and his his subility came to the utmost climax when he crept under the walls of Eden and seduced the bride. And we may be touched in our deepest of heart. But I wondered I wondered this week. Oh God, help me to convey this. The grief that Jesus experienced, he was experiencing because he was the son of God. He was he he was describing and expressing his father, God himself. He was expressing him. And God came down after death came in the cool of the day. This is the creator of heavens and earth. In his very apex, the greatest he could do is have a son. He looks around. Eden has become pretty empty. have no fellowship. We used to walk in the cool of the day. There's no communion. Can't even walk with my It's gone. Separated. A curtain has fallen. He's on the other side. A great chasm. Great chasm has happened. Here's a prophet in his little house. sees this little thing and that little thing. He said, "But it's what we had. It's all we had. We lived here. We had fellowship here. We communed here. But it's all taken away. It's torn from me." Here's God standing in. I think if brother Brandham had the power or you and I who have perhaps experienced similar things, we'd had the power to recreate it and change it. But God stood there. This is a He saw thorns coming. He saw the day that he saw an earth filled with violence. The Bible says he came down chapter six of chapter six of Genesis and the world is beauty conscious. They got a beauty cult going on and men and women take each other for husbands and wives and whatever more and the earth is filled with violence and we have it today. what we have today is what they had then and God saw that &gt;&gt; fact is I just received a little article from the Temple Institute and right at the top right at the top it I'm so amazed Genesis 6 and6 says in our Bible and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart. And in the Hebrew it says, "God regretted that he had made man on the earth and he was pained. He was pained to his very core." Stay with me, folks. Brother Brandham couldn't fix it. He couldn't change it. But God stood there and beyond the cross and beyond the sinful world and beyond the Noah the days of Noah and beyond the violence and beyond the Sodom and Gomorrah and beyond Leodysia. He saw another day coming. &gt;&gt; He saw another day coming and he declared, "I'll make all things new." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This can't stay this way. I'll make a new I'll make a new heaven. I'll make a new earth. And there'll be no death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll take a right out of the midst of it. I'll show this enemy that I'm God. &gt;&gt; I'll take a people that'll defy death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. While they're living, they'll defy death. I'll change them in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, and they'll defy death. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; And there's no wonder the heavens couldn't stay silent when Jesus walked up out of the water and a voice cried out, "This &gt;&gt; is my son." The voice heaven could not remain silent on Mount Transfiguration. This is my beloved son. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. What do you think? And he said, "Father, glorify thyself with the glory that he had in the beginning." And a voice like a thunder roared out, "I have glorified it and I will glorify it again. Now listen. And now comes a prophet on this hand. And it's needful that he's crushed and everything is stripped away from him. What's precious is taken from him. And he goes and backs and he looks said, "God, I don't want to live anymore. I don't want to live anymore. But while he looked at those things, he said, "They were ours. We lived here." And it ain't how it ain't the value of it. It's how you look at it. Let me tell you friends, there's a lot of folks here, a lot of us, and what you're looking at, it ain't the value you think it is. &gt;&gt; And it ain't worth what you're giving it. You need to only use it &gt;&gt; for the purpose of this one, this man, this man of Galilee, this one called Jesus Christ. And no wonder, oh God help me and God help you. No wonder that at this time here comes this little man exuding humility till people just see even see him believe it was Gordon Moore's wife her daughter just saw brother Brandham getting out of a little Model T car out on the road and she saw this little man step out of this old car and she said she had her hands I believe at the dishes in in the in the sink and she doesn't know why, but she said something just like a spirit come over and she just began to cry because she said the humility that marvelous. Isn't that marvelous? Oh, God. How I desire and yearn. People don't need to see us as successful, somebody who's accomplished, somebody who can make their way through this world and have the answers when people come into our presence. If they could sense a humility, they could sense a cleanness. They could sense an honesty and an integrity about us so that they would wonder and marvel. Who are you? What kind of person are you still coming? More important things just now. You can imagine the heart of God that he kept things in his mind. He kept secrets. He kept the plan. I'm not going to make it known. Satan and all the hordes of hell are not going to have this. I'm going to keep it a secret. I'm going to let the centuries go by. I'm going to let the world develop into some great exotic uh learned place and let them make a image to the brain and intellectual and cultural things and all the fineries. I'm going to let all of this happen. And then I'm going to bring bring along a uneducated person, a man who can't speak the queen's English, a man who hasn't been taught in the ways of religion and all. I let the world develop it. Let Satan develop his Eden. In the midst of that Eden, I'm going to bring my servant. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And going to bring him to a time I'll crush him and make him the kind of servant that he must be. But then a time will come and he's going to open the seals. He's going to reveal the secrets that have been in my mind since before the foundation of the world. And the prophet comes in the first seal. And he he says, and Jesus said, "Glorify thyself. I have glorified it. I will glorify it again." He said, "And what about the time?" He refers to it as an affidavit. What about the time that this time? And he says this, He says, "Now the seal," and let's read a little bit. He said, "Oh, how I'd like to dwell on that for just a few minutes, and I hope that you people know these things. The first thing when the lamb broke, the lamb broke the first seal. Can you just imagine? I put the thing together from Genesis all the way to our time. God who lost it all. God who said, "I'm going to make it again." Now, he's right on the very brink of revealing the whole plan. what has been, what is, and what will be. &gt;&gt; And he says this, and are they're waiting for I he says, I hope all the people that know these things and are waiting for the consolation of the Lord. And he says, now study real close. He has when the lamb broke the first seal, a thunder roared. He said, and that's the significance. When the lamb broke a seal, the thunder roared. I understand that brother John Andy says, "You young people and you've been hearing the seals are just starting on the seals." And I sent him an email because I want you to I want to say to you this morning, all of you young people, even those of you that were not there, you need to be there on Friday nights and you need to read read this seal. Read the portion you're going to be studying. Read it over every day. Read it and become acquainted with it so you're not coming in as a stranger to it. Read it. These are things that God held in his mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. From the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And then there came a voice and a thunder roared. That's a great significance. It's got a meaning. It's a meaning. He says, "Nothing happens without a meaning." Meaning a thunder. And he says, John the 12th chapter, the 23rd verse, he said, "Listen real close. Then you won't have to wonder no more what it is. And Jesus answering said, "The hour is come." Listen, before the voice spoke, Jesus is saying, "The hour has come." This man that I'm talking about is saying, "The hour has come." Now is the servant that's revealing that man, and he's saying, "The hour has come. &gt;&gt; The hour has come. that the Son of Man should be glorified. And he says, "See, you're at the end of an age. His ministry is ending." Referring to Christ at that time. And he says, "The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified." And he asks this question to those I'm asking it to you. What about the hour has come when his bride must be taken away? &gt;&gt; What about that hour, folks? God has waited a long time for that hour when the bride must be taken away. A people, a people who have heard his voice, a people who have received a confir confirmation. Is there something in your heart today that says this is it and this is him? This is him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you have that in your heart? &gt;&gt; This is him. &gt;&gt; This is my bridegroom. Just remember friends, however long we live, let's not try to polish him up. He will always be rejected. He will always be a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. This will always be him. He's been that from the beginning. But the hour is come that the Son of Man shall be glorified. And the hour has come, he says, "What about the hour has come that time shall be no more? And the angel is ready to set one foot on the land and the other on the sea and a rainbow over his head." &gt;&gt; What about that hour? He's asking, "What about that hour?" Amen. &gt;&gt; And here you are. &gt;&gt; Here we are &gt;&gt; in that hour. &gt;&gt; We're in that hour. &gt;&gt; I want you to go home today and think real real deep and real hard. And I pray that the Holy Spirit will almost like be hauntingly on your footsteps and that you'll be conscious throughout your life. What value am I placing on this? And how have we valued him? This lovely one. this message did not come to us very easy and it didn't come to us cheap. And brother Brandham, he said, uh, if you only knew, brother, sister, I'm closing. You look down there and say, "Oh, this is easy. These hear things." He said, "You don't know what's behind the life." See, he goes all the way back. You don't know. They saw it in the glamour. They saw it in the power. They saw the demonstration. But he said, "You don't know what's behind the life." And he said, "This old heart's been broke and tore to pieces until God gets out." But someday it'll be over. So you're still standing there saying, "You don't know what's behind it." And we don't. I don't expect that we will sit here this morning. But I preached this service so that you may have not just a mere more information, more knowledge, but a deeper experience. Say we can say father this what I'm enjoying today has been very costly very costly and I so appreciate it. No wonder God and perhaps you have not seen it or perhaps you've not even maybe it's never passed through your mind but listen to me friend as a servant of Christ. God almighty God the one that walked in Eden whose heart was broken. He looked at what he made. All the glorious things and the cre and the creatures, millions of them extinct, but they weren't then. And he looked on it. It was empty. Wasn't very meaningful. But what he's seeing as you're sitting here today, what he's seeing is the power, the word. the word. This is the most glorious thing because what he's doing, he's making the very thing that was the very heart in the core that pained him. The very heart of it that was ripped away. He's seeing it coming back together again. And it was tore from him by a perverted word. And now I've sent a pure word. I'm opening up the secret. I'm opening up the mysteries. I have a vessel that I crushed &gt;&gt; to make him ready, to make him the kind of vessel that would stay true. &gt;&gt; Even when he was enticed by the multitudes and the wealth and the glamour and the honor and all of it, he disdained it and remained true. &gt;&gt; Because you must speak to a people I've given everything for and they will treasure me. They will love me. They will honor me. And we I will take them in my embrace and be united with them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you haven't experienced that, I pray that today in this moment that you will say, "My heart is open. Lord, take and pregnant me with your word. do something special. Bring me into that relationship. I sense it. I feel it. I'm being pulled. I'm being drawn. If you will, if you'll give over and if you'll yield, I feel ordained to tell you you can enter into a life that you have not experienced hitherto to this time. Let us pray. Father, I'm speaking about you and I'm speaking to you. This audience of people, Lord, who we have walked together, some for a shorter period of time and others for a very long time. And Lord, there I know that deep down in the recesses of the hearts of these people is a a a throbb, a desire. Satan would like to cover it over. He would like to he would like to contaminate it if he could. He would like to dilute it. He would like to encumber it if he could. But oh God, I pray that that desire that you put there for yourself, for your own glory, for your own joy, for your own pleasure, let it rise. Let it rise above all the rest of the turmoil and the den and the noise and the dust and the clamor of the world. Let it rise. Let it rise. Let it rise. Lord, take the words that I've attempted to speak this morning. Take the frailty. Take the weakness of it. Take the simplicity of it and just bring it. I feel Lord, I've said all that I could say. How you touched my own heart. How I was sensing and feeling some of the same shifting and moving of emotions as it were, the waters of the sea and the ocean washing over my own soul. And oh God, I I would desire that not only for myself but for all that are here and all that are listening and all that are viewing that they will be so drawn and so powerfully moved that they will simply say yes Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes. I I don't know how to do it and I cannot on my own strength do anything but I just give myself to you in a yielding in a yielding and in a surrender. Come Lord Jesus be in attendance here now because I'm I am convinced that you're here. Others are convinced there are those that are very needy here. I pray, oh God, you make yourself known and real to them in the name of Jesus Christ. The name of Jesus Christ. Could we just sing? Come by here, my Lord. [Music] Invite him, will you? Will you invite him? Don't let anything hinder you. Come by here. [Music] &gt;&gt; Sister Katie, Sister Katie, would you come, please? Come by here. &gt;&gt; Come by here. [Music] Come by. &gt;&gt; Someone's praying. [Music] Someone's praying. [Music] Someone's praying [Music] mighty [Music] Let's all stand. Someone's praying. [Music] Someone's great [Music] by [Music] [Music] your eyesight. [Music] We see you reaching out through your promise. We see you reaching out to Sister Katie in bright form. We see you reaching out, oh God, to her now, oh God. And bring under the curse, this affliction. Bring under the curse, oh God, this thing that is foreign to her body. [Music] [Music] of this word of this message in the name of Jesus Christ. [Music] Spring [Music] was [Music] good [Music] Come by. &gt;&gt; Come by here, my Lord. Come by here. Come by here Come here. [Music] Come here. My [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; 783. These are the words that brother Brandham said he just heard as the wind was coming through. This is what he heard. I think it would be fine, wonderful, appropriate for us to sing it. When they ring the golden bells for you and me. Oh, when we hear the angels singing, will we hear them? Will you hear them? &gt;&gt; Are you happy about it? &gt;&gt; Is it a reality? &gt;&gt; There's a land river that they call forever and we only reach by faith. [Music] And everyone let the words speak to you now. We'll gain the mortals there to dwell with the immortals when they ring the golden bells for you and me. Oh, don't you hear the bells bow ringing? You hear the angels singing his gloral [Applause] [Music] to the [Music] far [Music] beyond the shiny river when they Ring the golden bells for you and me. &gt;&gt; Like to have the last verse, please. The third verse. When our shall go their number when we sleep. When the king commands the spirit to be free. Never [Music] kingdom. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. for you and me. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you hear the bells ringing? You hear the angels singing is the gloral to [Music] forever just beyond the shin river. And they ring the bells for you and I thought it was so appropriate that uh Rabbi Richmond and the Temple Institute this is the they don't just select at random uh scripture but they have a a a scripture that they follow at certain times in the year. And this scripture of God's heart being pained comes just after they've had suka, which is the remembrance that they're transient here. This is not your home. You remember that you're transient. And you'll make a booth for seven days. And you'll stay in the booth seven days. But after that, and this is the next scripture, cuz God was pained to the core, but that's not where it ended. He said, "I'll make all things new." [Music] &gt;&gt; I trust we can truly appreciate and put the right kind of value on the fact that God called you. &gt;&gt; God brought you into this. &gt;&gt; God allowed you to hear this. Could we not say thank God? &gt;&gt; I thank God. &gt;&gt; I put great value upon this. &gt;&gt; My prayers may God touch your hearts very very deeply. We'll pray. Our dear Lord Jesus, what a lovely atmosphere. What a lovely group of people. What a marvelous, marvelous message and word that you have sent us. We see you in it, Lord. We see you rejected. We see you esteemed, smitten. We hear all kinds of things, but it only makes us love you more. We say, "You're altogether lovely. You're the fairest of 10,000 to my soul. Oh Jesus. Jesus. Living word, living Christ. I pray that you will pass through the barriers. Oh God, pass through the barriers of this material world and touch the souls of the people when they go to their home or where they go to have some refreshment. Touch them so deeply, oh God. Even in the midst of a crowd, in the midst of their family, may they feel separated to you and alone with you and in fellowship and communion with you. Let the effects of this service be longlasting. May it be eternal in the lives of those that you've ordained. People have driven long ways, Lord. Pray that you'll bless them for their efforts. Bless those that got up very early and those that are staying late to hear and be and to participate. Bless them in the home, I pray, where they are, wherever it might be at this time. And now, oh God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, God of the prophets, and God of the messengers, God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, receive these humble words. Lord, forgive us our sins. Forgive us our failings and our mistakes and iniquities. And may the precious blood of your lamb, God's lamb, cleanse us every wit that we want to be pure and holy before you. And give us a sense of value that the world can never give us. That we might love each other as we ought to. that we might see Christ in bride form in the name of Jesus Christ. Ask you to bless the afternoon now and the service this evening for your glory, Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen. Oh, how I love Jesus. Oh, &gt;&gt; how [Music] I love Jesus. [Music] How I love Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. We dismiss you in that lovely name. Go and have some rest and refreshment here this evening. And as you leave, I'd ask that no one speak in the foyer and you just mind the Lord. Do whatever he tells you to do. I dismiss you in the name of Jesus Christ. You're free to go. Greet one another. God bless you. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music]
