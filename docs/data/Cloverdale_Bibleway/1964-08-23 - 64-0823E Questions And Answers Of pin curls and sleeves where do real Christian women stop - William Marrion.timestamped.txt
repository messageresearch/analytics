[0:00] but in the days of the voice of the
[0:01] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[0:03] sound the mystery of God should be
[0:05] finished as he hath declared to his
[0:08] servants the
[0:10] prophets now first question I pulled out
[0:13] here brother brandom is it wrong for a
[0:16] Christian to put her hair in pin curls
[0:21] also what length should her sleeves be
[0:25] thank you a sister um now that's means a
[0:28] whole lot to that woman now to some of
[0:31] us Brothers we might think oh this silly
[0:32] woman but but it's not silly to her she
[0:36] wants to know now about putting hair in
[0:41] uh what was it pigtails or something
[0:44] other I'm sorry I I didn't I'm sorry pin
[0:48] curls excuse me pin pigtail that's what
[0:52] the girls used to wear years ago you
[0:53] remember kind wasn't that right they
[0:55] call them pigtails just kind of curls
[0:56] hang down no pin curls excuse me friend
[1:00] um uh what length sleeves should she
[1:03] wear I I don't think that it is anything
[1:08] about that I don't know you see what I
[1:10] can't back up the Bible I I don't want
[1:12] to say much about it now I'm just
[1:14] telling you this for me because I have
[1:17] no scripture to back this up the only
[1:19] thing I have for the ladies about their
[1:21] hair is not to cut it how they want to
[1:24] wear it that's up to them and about the
[1:27] pin curls actually I don't know what
[1:28] they are unless these things look like
[1:30] clothes pins that they stick in their
[1:32] hair about only thing that I know and
[1:35] the lengths of sleeves I think being a
[1:38] Christian God will tell you what to do
[1:40] about those things you see I believe as
[1:43] a Christian person you you know about
[1:45] how to do that I don't think God Cuts
[1:47] any certain lengths or whatever it is as
[1:49] long as you're decent and look honorable
[1:51] and clean I I think that's all right
[1:54] don't you see now that's just my opinion
[1:56] now this is me see cuz I can't back
[1:59] nothing else up with the scripture I
[2:00] believe this morning the question come
[2:02] up about um uh uh painting the hair you
[2:05] know with a with a color now I I if I I
[2:08] can't say anything about that I don't
[2:10] know but I I have no scripture say not
[2:13] the the color your hair that's that's
[2:16] you women you like to look nice and you
[2:18] should look nice and brother bram's not
[2:20] against you children you're my children
[2:22] I I I love you and I I don't want to be
[2:25] balling you out I I wouldn't do it for
[2:27] nothing I'm only trying to help you but
[2:30] now look let me just ask let me say this
[2:32] and answer to that question are you
[2:34] ready and to you on the tape here it is
[2:37] sisters if there is a question in it
[2:40] don't do it but if you're if you're
[2:43] filled with God's spirit and led to go
[2:45] do it as long as it don't interfere with
[2:47] the scripture you're perfectly satisfied
[2:50] that that's the will of the Lord then go
[2:51] ahead and do it see because there's no
[2:53] scripture to say no see about it I don't
[2:56] don't say nothing like that in the Bible
[2:58] I know Isaiah 5 believe it this talk
[3:00] about women how they would wear
[3:01] changeable apparel and everything like
[3:04] that but that was pride and stuff hold
[3:06] on if you do that for Pride then it's
[3:08] wrong see examine your heart before God
[3:12] if there's no scripture for in the way
[3:13] the spirit leads you you go ahead and do
[3:15] it but now when it comes to whether you
[3:17] should have long hair or short hair you
[3:20] have long hair that's the bival
