TRANSCRIPT
========================================
matter so little how much you may or the people you've known. It all comes to nothing when praised at his feet. It's nothing to Jesus, just meories to keep. Only one life, so soon it will pass. Only what's done for Christ will last. only one chance to do his will. So give to Jesus all your days. It's the only life that pays when you recall. You have but one life. You may take all the treasures from far away lands. Take all the riches you can hold in your hands. And take all the pleasures your riches can buy. But what will you have when it's your time to die? Only one life. So soon it will pass. Only what's done for Christ will last. only one chance to do his will. So give to Jesus all your days. It's the only life that pays when you recall. You have but one life. [Music] The days pass so the months come and go. The years melt away like new fallen snow. Spring turns to summer. Summer to fall. Autumn brings winter and death comes to all. Only one life, so soon it will pass. Only what's done for Christ will last, only one chance to do his will. So give to Jesus all your days. It's the only life that pays when you recall. You have but one life. One life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Why don't we sing number 430 on the screen? This is my desire to honor you. Brother Jeremy and a couple of sisters have a song, Jeremy Waldner. So maybe they could come while we're singing this a couple of times. &gt;&gt; This is my desire [Music] to honor you, &gt;&gt; Lord. With all my heart I worship you. &gt;&gt; All I have within me I give you praise. All that I adore is in you. Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my soul. I live for you alone. Every breath that I take, every moment I &gt;&gt; Lord have your way in me. &gt;&gt; Let's sing it again. Oh, this is my desire to honor you, Lord, with all my heart. I worship you. Oh, all I have within me, I give you praise. All that I adore is in you, &gt;&gt; Lord. I give you my heart. I give you my soul. I live for you alone. Every breath that I take, every moment I make, have your way in me. [Music] It is written that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God. And by his word, he gave his son for us on Calary to pay the price of sin for you and for me. &gt;&gt; By his word, &gt;&gt; he raised the sick man from the veil. By his word &gt;&gt; he gave life unto the dead. &gt;&gt; By his word, &gt;&gt; oh he brings hope to the hopeless soul. &gt;&gt; To the hopeless soul by his word &gt;&gt; you can have the victory. &gt;&gt; For he has set the captive free. He gives life to you and me. [Music] Just one word was broken in Eden and that's what caused a fall. So it will take all of the word to bring us back to God. And through this last day message, all his word has been made known. And through its power, we have overcome. &gt;&gt; He spoke and squirrels of hair. Storm roll back from where you came. Little flesh, I give you back your life. He made your life. He spoke the tumor right of existence. &gt;&gt; He gave to voice salvation. Word. He gives life to you and me. &gt;&gt; By his word &gt;&gt; we'll be changed like Abraham and Sarah. &gt;&gt; Be caught away like Elijah. [Music] We will raise the sleep and save &gt;&gt; raise by his word. Let go to a wedding supp. We will live eternally. By his word, we'll be changed like by his word be away like we will raise the sleeping ra [Music] to see our ris eternally. By his word we will live eternally. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you enjoy that &gt;&gt; by his word? &gt;&gt; And that's what we're here to hear this morning. Why don't we sing as our pastor comes this morning number 681, blessed assurance, Jesus is mine. This is our story. It's not somebody else's story. It's your story. Amen. Let's sing it together.

Bring forth life, Father. &gt;&gt; We're looking to you, the lamb of God, this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's just sing that chorus again as our pastor comes. &gt;&gt; This is my story. [Music] This is my song. I'm praising my savior [Music] all day long. [Music] This is my story. This is my song. Praising myior [Music] all the day long. Amen. God bless you. Wonderful day. &gt;&gt; It's always a good day in his presence, isn't it? I'll just have you have your seats for a few moments. Nice to see church full. And I know they're sitting in the sanctuary in the not only sanctuary, but in the fellowship room. Just uh yesterday I was uh just walking through a restaurant and uh looked down and and strange as it might seem, I had just mentioned this man's name. He's a a well well-known oldtimer from the Cloverdale area. And I had just mentioned his name to another person. I probably wouldn't mention his name in in years and years. I would have no reason to. Uh, and uh, I I walked through this restaurant and there he's sitting right there. And uh, so I called him by name and took him by the hand and he just didn't want to let go of my hand. He didn't know who I was to begin with. And and I gave him my name. I says, "It's Ed Piscll." Oh my. And he's sitting there with a younger lady and it was his daughter. And it turned out she had him there on his 83rd birthday. And uh I said I you won't believe this. I said in the last two hours I just spoke of you to another man. And I told him about you and and told him about you know a little bit about how I knew you and etc. etc. He had a trucking business right here in in Cloverdale. Just one or two trucks and you know just a a man at I he graveled for me when I built our house about 35 years ago. And uh and so then he started speaking to his his daughter. He says he asked me, he said, "You you know, you're still connected with the the the church or Bible way or something." "Oh, yes." I said, "There's about 800." "Oh," he said. He started talking to his daughter. He said, "You can't even get in that parking lot." He he knew all about it. He knew more about it than a lot of other people. And here you you you don't realize you wouldn't think that a a just a lot of metal on rubber tires driving into a parking lot is a witness to anybody. &gt;&gt; But you're a witness every time you drive in. &gt;&gt; You're a witness every time you walk into the house of God because it raises a question. What's it all about? &gt;&gt; What is drawing those people there? What fills that parking lot on a Wednesday night? Why are they there? I had a pastor in this town tell me, he said, "I can't hardly get 10 people on Wednesday night." And they're just absolutely baffled. It's a good reason. &gt;&gt; Good thing said, "Let the world be baffled. &gt;&gt; Let the world be in wonderment." &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad we got something to shout about. &gt;&gt; I'm glad we got something to rejoice in. Glad we got something we can look forward to, &gt;&gt; you know, not just to be enthused, but something to be enthused about &gt;&gt; and to have a reason behind it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I'm enthused. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We just had uh uh thank you for your prayers. We just had uh services in Lima, Ohio with Brother Jeff Jenkins, and uh it was their annual family camp as well uh held right at their church. And uh it was probably I I would say the most outstanding meetings and uh that I've been in. I just spoke three of them. Brother Barry Coffee was there. Brother Eugene Braun uh also speaking participating in the meetings. But for whatever reason, and I don't try to I don't try to question God or to ask him, you know, why he does certain things at certain times, but there was just a a a very wonderful presence. And I believe that brother Jeff Jenkins said it right. He said it was really a two-part thing in that the presence of God was there, but also he said the people were so filled with expectation, he just couldn't get over that aspect of it. And to me, he hit the nerve because that was the key. And on a on our Saturday evening meeting, uh it was it was a very very unusual the presence of God. And then long after we left the service, uh, Brother Jeff told me they were there till 11:00 or or after and people standing and people just sitting and people at the front and whatever more. I I perhaps had already left the service. I don't know. I don't want you to clap. I don't want you to rejoice because this is a I don't know exactly how to take just what I'm going to tell you now. I've never had any experience like this. I've never had it in a service that I've been in. And uh it it was uh it was a great victory. It was a great disappointment after I was speaking on I had just been speaking here on you as an individual and the bride of Jesus Christ being the expression you're not called to be you know uh workmen or plumbers or carpenters or business people or whatever more or or even housewives you are called to that but that's not your main purpose in life. your main purpose and the reason why you're here and the reason why God brought you here is to express the mystery of God which is Christ and and it was powerful and God came down and vindicated that message that that thought that theme. There was a woman in a wheelchair and been in a wheelchair for two years and she was in the back uh I think just outside of the sanctuary. Her husband was there wheeling her and another woman was there and this woman in the wheelchair said to the woman, she said, "I see Jesus Christ in you." And that woman turned around to her and said, "Well, if you see Jesus Christ in me, stand up out of that wheelchair and walk." That woman stood up out of that wheelchair, walked into the church, walked down to the front, and began to worship God. Her husband, in a stunned uh uh shock, took the wheelchair and followed her down all the way down to the front &gt;&gt; and was right behind her with the wheelchair. And when she was done worshiping and praising God like that, she looked around, saw the wheelchair, and went and sat back down in it and lost it. Just like that. Brother Brandham said, and we may take these things lightly, but we shouldn't. He said, "As sure as your faith will take it away, your doubt will bring it back." &gt;&gt; And he said, "She just glazed over." And brother Jeff even talked to her and it was just like a glaze had come over her and she couldn't hardly grasp what had happened and why she was now in that state again. It's a lesson for us. I wasn't going to tell you this, but I thought I would. It's a lesson for us. It's a lesson for us. Listen to it. That your faith will take it away and your doubt will bring it back. We need to really really and I pray that this woman will enter into that place again. I really do. I pray that she'll not have to go through life in that wheelchair. But I tell you what, if I'd been two years in a wheelchair and and and and got up and walk because I saw Christ in a woman, the last thing I'd want to do is sit back down in it. I'd say, "Take that thing and throw it off a bridge. I'm done with that." &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And friends, you know, maybe you haven't got a wheelchair, but in one sense, we all do. &gt;&gt; We all have something we sit in. We all have something we rely on. We all have something that our unbelief causes us to to be hindered by and we want to be sure and get out of that thing. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; We also had while there were two young men that God spoke to at that same evening, both young men, one was a Pentecostal young man and another young man that had been hanging around on the per perimeter of the message, but had never dedicated his life to it. And God spoke to both of those young men that night. And both of them were baptized and received Christ in the fullness of his word. And that was a great victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. I mentioned the message hub. In fact, is we had uh the two videos that we've shown on the message hub here. The one with brother Derek introducing it and uh the one that uh uh brother Kim and brother Michael uh took when they were in the Philippines. It was about an 8-minute clip. So, I just said, "Well, maybe we'll just show both of these." And we we did show it to the people and and just exactly what we have so long for and desired. I said, "This is only second time we've shown this. We we showed it to our congregation, but we're not really ready. This is rather premature, but we're going to go ahead and I will just fill in here what uh what the vision is, what the objective is." And they they just caught it like that. And there was a brother from Kenya and he came forward and he says, "I've been a translator for years. I want to translate. The key is the when once a message is translated your people will be able to read it anywhere in the world probably within just a few hours. &gt;&gt; That's the key. &gt;&gt; And he came for he wrote a note and said I want one of those printers and I want to be a translator. And other brother was from Ghana there. Both of them were pastors. And then brother brother Barry Coffee who is just going to be going uh to Ukraine and in fact as I will be meeting him in the Ukraine in first week of October and then he's going on up to uh Moscow where we have sent funds from that's been given by uh some people that are streaming the service been given by people here in the church and we've already sent the first amount of funds over there. They are I think that was probably the first amount that substantial amount they received and they are so uh inspired. They are so quickened that they can now move forward and they're moving forward with the plans. Brother Barry is going over there. But as I spoke about the hub and about the printers and and you know I don't know uh just how you are going to take this but it it seems that it's just you know it's just the hand of God of of all the printers that were chosen to for the kiosk and for the hub and I was between brother Randy Snow's work brother Kim's work and anyway this one printer was chosen and of all of the printers probably hundreds that huelet Packard make they put that one on sale at half price. &gt;&gt; I just said I said you know God made them do that. &gt;&gt; And they they they said they'll be on pray on on half sale to the end of this month. So, Brother Barry Coffee and uh and the the church there, they got they got a bunch. They said, "We want to put between 15 and 20 of these print stations in uh in Russia and they're just taking it and making use of the hub that's been created and and uh got the message on it. Uh and more messages are going on all the time. I I'm just so delighted at what is happening and people are picking up on it. In fact, is this morning probably they they uh Brother Barry set it all up, connect it onto the internet in his church to show the people he bring he'll bring a message down and have it printed right there on the platform. I tell you what, people are getting it. He said he said outside of the initial search message, the search for the message which was done many many years ago and there's many of you here in the church that have it and that's what everyone uses. He said outside of that initial search for the message, he said this is in his estimation is the greatest thing that has happened since then. And I I am just so thankful that we can be a part of that. And I rejoice in it, friends. I rejoice in it. I don't know what your plans are. God might be in them. He might not be in them. I don't know. I don't know what your what your thoughts are. He might be in them. He might not be in them. But I'll tell you one thing. God is in this message. &gt;&gt; God loves this message. I don't know about your plans or where you're going or what you intend to do. And God may be in it. He may not be in it. But I do know that God's in this message. God's in this word. And whatever you can do to send that out, I don't care how you do it. God God will bless you for it. &gt;&gt; And we don't do it for blessing. We do it because it's our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Uh, our camp is coming up in just a a few more days. Really, it's rushing up on us so quickly. I want to say a few things to the congregation. First, I want to thank the congregation for the way that you have lived your lives, for your sacrifice, for your giving, for your labor and all and in every way. It includes everybody really includes everybody. Without your giving and support, we would not have been able to initially make the uh purchase possible which has happened. And without people coming forward uh such as our brother uh Chris uh Peterson and uh this congregation will really never know the amount of time that our brother Chris and then our brother Randy Snow making it uh making it a fireproof uh I won't say fireproof but fire prevention system throughout the place. You've heard me say some of this before, but I just want to take a few moments because we're rushing up now to our camp time. We have not done this to have a 44 acre camp out of Mount Baker. We've done it for whatever spiritual purpose God will do. You people have homes, you have apartments, you have condos or whatever that you live in. Uh, and you might say, well, I bought this home because I needed it. My family needed it. My or have to have a place to live. I bought this place because I've got to have a place to work. But the ultimate the ultimate purpose and objective in everybody's life. And these are kind of four pre uh comments before my message today. But the real reason we do these things is because our whole life and everything we do is towards God. All of you that have contributed and have volunteered your time and given your time. I we don't want to wear you out. We don't want to burn you out. But I want to say this. It's like riding a bicycle. You know, you ride a bicycle. uh you might get all played out or you you you do something that takes up your energy, but when you're done, you know what happens? Uh you rest a little while and God gives you that energy back. Isn't that amazing? &gt;&gt; So, you've been out at camp and you've worked and you've labored and you've given and and we thank you for that. More than that, I believe that God who keeps an accurate set of books, he knows exactly what you have done and how you have prayed and so on so forth. And then and then you get all wearied out, but you have a little rest and you know what? It comes back &gt;&gt; and you're renewed again. You didn't have to put anything in the slot machine to get it. God just gave you the strength back. &gt;&gt; So, you gave it freely, but God also gave you freely. He gave it all back. So, I would just say to the congregation, you make yourself available. We need uh you I think we've got counselors and then there's uh staff that's needed in the in the kitchen in the camp and not only our camp but uh we're trying rushing right now to get finished and brother Chris, brother Randy just needing whatever kind of help. And if they make known to you if you can uh you know give a few hours of time it'll be so so helpful. They're just finishing the last things. And I don't know you out there at the fellowship room at the fellowship day I should say but very much has taken place even since then. And it's going to be a place it's going to be a place it's going to be a retreat. It'll be a place where you'll be able to go where you'll be able to just be in that kind of atmosphere. And now it brings me to uh my last point on this and that is I would like to call on this congregation to take uh specific time and quality time and set it aside and get alone with God and pray for this camp. I feel that God wants to visit us in a special way. &gt;&gt; I desire the supernatural. &gt;&gt; We don't just desire to have a lot of preaching. We don't desire just to have music and worship, but we desire to see the supernatural hand of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want I want to bring you to a place of expectation. Why should we not believe? For all things are possible to them that believe. Are we believers? &gt;&gt; Oh, you want to confess you're a believer. You know, we've had sicknesses and things hang on and diseases and things hang on and infirmities and things hang on and and and if it and if those things don't take place, Brother Brandham right at the end of his ministry still had sisters in wheelchairs that were sitting right there and he said, "She's like a beautiful flower here amongst us." That then that's God's part. But let not our faith be diluted. Let not our faith be diminished. We want to believe for all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why settle for less? &gt;&gt; We want to see the supernatural amongst us. And the greatest supernatural be supernatural spiritual deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so that is why I would like to ask you to that's more than volunteering. We're not volunteering. We're doing something that's a part of our life and that is to pray for a special pray for you. I'll give you some specific things to pray for. Pray that God will give me wisdom. Pray that God will give the brothers in charge. Brother Tom, Sister Joanne, Brother Jess, Sister Lynn, Brother Tom Frey, and his his good wife to and and they take charge of of aspects of it. Brother Raymond and Sister Raesa and all the sisters, you sisters, sister Karen and Sister Karen Hendrickson here and people that have taken just given themselves so unreservedly. We appreciate it, don't we? &gt;&gt; I know that you do. And I don't think there's anything wrong with saying God bless them &gt;&gt; and God bless you, each one of you, because I know that you have so given. And I'm and so I'm not talking about that for camp. I'm talking about that for what God wants to do. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to see sons and daughters. And this is the largest camp we've ever had. We've maxed out completely in the senior camp. The senior camp is around 350 right now and we've been below 200. All we've filled it up. We're putting and people are just saying we're just coming and we don't know where to put them. And uh and there's people who wanted to come and they've said, "We've heard that it's an exclusive camp that nobody can get in." I said, "No." I had to answer them because they were quite upset about it. I said, "No, it's not an exclusive camp, but you'll have to get a motel someplace. We only have so much only so much beds. That's what's exclusive about it. And after that, then you can you can just come to the meetings." The meetings are open in the evening. Let's pray for the for the speaker, our brother Ron. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe God spared him. Don't you? &gt;&gt; I believe God spared him for one of the purposes. He spared him is to be here with us. &gt;&gt; And if God spared him for that purpose, I believe that God has certain words already set aside. Not for last week, but for and but for that time. Amen. And I want you to come to the I want you to come out of those grounds with that in your heart. God preserved this speaker. When death tried to take him and Satan tried to take him, God preserved him and he's coming here with words of God and he's going to utter them. And I want you to believe that this morning. &gt;&gt; I could have gone a long time ago, but God's preserved me and I believe preserved me to be here and have something for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to take it and receive it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. All right. Thank you for the songs that the sisters sang and and uh Sister Hannah and Esther and Naomi. I appreciate that song so very very much. And brother Jeremy along with Sister Lesanne and Sister Florence and Sister Elizabeth. We appreciate those words the concerning the blood of Jesus Christ. Well, I've taken a little extra time, but I feel that I that's my privilege. Why don't you stand with us? Just before we turn to the word, I'd like to pray with you. What a wonderful moment this is, Lord Jesus, that we can refer and and bring ourselves and refer to you, oh God, as our father. And we uh we love Lord this these moments when we can be together and and sense your divine nearness and just have evidence Lord even as I've related to the people of the things that you have done. Lord I rejoice to see you two young strong men who had resisted giving themselves so freely but then your presence overwhelmed them. Lord, I think of the woman who got up out of the wheelchair. I pray that even now, Father, that that will have come back on her. I pray that she's already out of it again, Lord. I pray she'll be out of it for the rest of her life, Father. Whatever you have in store for her. And whatever you desire to do, Lord, amongst us, not only today, not only in this service, but in our individual lives, when we move about the town, when we move about our work, when we moved about our community and amongst our associates and friends, and especially when we move about the body of Christ, may we be a dedicated, sanctified, holy vessel for you. May we be a strength to one another. Oh God, I pray you'll banish every doubt. I pray you'll banish every wrong amongst us. Oh God, I pray you'll remove every obstacle in the name of Jesus Christ. You said whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. We bind the efforts of the enemy. We bind Satan against uh against his purpose and his will. We bind him, oh God, according to your word and according to your promise. And now, Father, I pray there will be a mighty release of the Holy Spirit upon the people, upon our hearts. Oh God, if there's a heart that's out of place, out of tune, I pray, Lord, they will just come into harmony now with your will. Oh Lord, I pray you'll open your word, send a spirit of revelation upon us that we might see clearly. And I pray you'll anoint us, anoint myself, Father, as I give myself to you. and each one, Lord, as they receive your word, may it fall into good ground. I pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I'll invite you to uh take your Bible if you would please in turning to Genesis. And while you're turning to Genesis, I the 32nd chapter. Actually, I want to also say that I have heard from so many places how blessed you were uh last Sunday, Brother Lance's service. &gt;&gt; Amen. I heard he broke all time records. And I'm glad that we shattered that time zone for Brother Lance. God bless you, Brother Lance. Amen. Hallelujah. I think preacher needs to forget the clock sometime. And that's what these Sunday morning services we don't have a a evening service uh right now and during this time but they do have the service in Seattle. So we are mindful of that as well. But uh uh us preachers we need lots of help. God bless you. All right. In the 32nd chapter I'm going to be skipping some verses. We'll read verse 1 2 and 3 and then 6 and 7 and then 9 10 11 and 12 and then I'll be jumping down to verse 20. This is about Jacob just to give you the background. And Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him. And when Jacob saw them, he said, "Uh, this is God's host." And he called the name of that place Mahanim. And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Sire, the country of Edom. And the messengers returned to Jacob. Verse six, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and 400 men with him. And then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed. And he divided the people that was with him and the flocks and herds and the camels into two bands. Verse n. And Jacob said, this is his prayer. Oh God, my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the Lord, which said unto me, return unto thy country, and to the kindred, thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee. Now, he's rehearsing to the Lord what God has spoken to him. Verse 10. I am not worthy of the least of all thy mere mercies, and of all the truth which thou hast showed unto thy servant. For with my staff I have passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands. Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me and the mother of the children. and thou hast uh and thou saidest, I will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which uh cannot be numbered for multitude. Now, that is kind of a uh just a preamble to the message, which I would like now to focus on verse 24. And Jacob was left alone because Jacob's he sends gifts to Esau and then he sends his family from him and he's left alone. And there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh. And the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him. And he said, "Let me go, for the day breakth." And he said, "I will not let thee go." That's the angel said, "Let me go." And Jacob has said, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me." Notice now he this is one that has already received the blessing. But now this is something beyond the blessing of the birthright and the blessing of his father Isaac. He's gone now. Now there's something within him. He recognizes. You may not know exactly who this person is, but he said, "I will not let you go except thou bless me." And he said unto him, "What is thy name?" And he said, "Jacob." And he said, "Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel, for as a prince has thou power with God, and with men, and hast prevailed." And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, "Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?" And he blessed him there. And Jacob called the name of the place Peninoale, which is meaning facing God. For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved." And as he passed over Penoale, the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh. Now he said, "I have seen God." Verse 30, if you look please, I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved. You may be seated. I'm going to ask for your undivided attention and your full focus because you're sometimes it's difficult and I feel a a challenge for as a as a minister feel a challenge to try to get a whole group of people to follow the thought as God has brought it to me because sometimes it seems that you you need some distance you know there's a distance between one thought and the next thought so just ask the Holy Spirit now to give you the same kind of understanding and the way he spoke to me about this I want to speak on my life is preserved and Jacob ties that directly in to seeing God face to face said I've seen God face to face and my life is preserved served in the in the patmas vision when John the apostle saw the Lord Jesus Christ. Now he never he did not see him as he knew him on earth. This was a very very different scene. It was so different and so numbing and so consuming upon him that when he saw him, he fell at his feet as one dead. He never did that in life. Never once did John fall at the feet of Jesus Christ in flesh as one dead. But when he saw him now in the revelation, he fell at his feet as one dead. And uh brother Brandham brings out uh that uh the seven descriptions of his personage. The seven description there's seven church ages. And just watch now the seven descriptions. And his head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow. Number one. His eyes were as a flame of fire. Number two. and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace. Number three, his voice as the sound of many waters. Number four, and he had in his right hand seven stars. Number five, and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword. Number six, and his countenance, his face was as it were the sun that shineth in its strength. Number seven, in the scripture, when you saw the face, we saw him face to face. That is that you now met the person, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Not you're not just seeing a part of the person, but you have met the person. And that is why the words are even interchangeable in the scripture concerning the face uh panim in the in the old testament the face of the person was the person and when they when you saw their face that meant the person was now present. I want you to hang on to that. The seventh the seventh church age. The seventh church age as I saw his countenance and there was no more description after that. That was now the total person was present in the seventh church age. That is the purpose of our day is not that we should have another blessing or learn something more about God but that God would make himself present amongst a people. &gt;&gt; Amen. I understand we're going to have a wedding here this coming Saturday. I can tell you for those of you that come here and attend the wedding, it won't be a bride with a groom in her imagination. And it won't be a groom standing here with no no bride. Just him in his imagination. and said, "Well, I'm imagining she's there, or I'm imagining he's there. I have a perfectly pictured in I have a perfect image in my mind." That won't do it. &gt;&gt; That just not going to suffice. The person has to be present and they want to turn towards each other and look each other face to face. We didn't marry something imaginary. We didn't come to this wedding. We're the prophet said, "We're married here." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not married here to some some image in our mind or some historical figure of the past. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And if that's what we would have, then you don't know him yet. But you're married to one who has come present. How did we come to know him? Because he unveiled himself. He made himself known in his word. This is me. I'm describing myself accurately, perfectly, precisely, and my spirit of my person has come to make that word alive. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the seventh age messenger the seventh age and the messenger you have been brought face to face or have been brought we'll put it another word. You've been brought face to face or you have been brought into the presence of that person into the presence of this one that's been described. And then Revelation 10:1. Notice now, brother Brennan goes back to Revelation the first chapter and says the same person. So he says, "And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun." The reason why now his face becomes uh becomes a key uh a a key part of this verse is because it's his person. Now notice also he said a rainbow was upon his head. That's a covenant. That was the word part. And his face was as it were the sun. That's the person himself is present. And his feet as pillars of fire. It's important to recognize that his face and his feet are represent his person and his feet is always identified with judgment. If you look in re in Revelation 1, his feet were like fine brass that burned in the fire and brass all through the scripture is judgment. when he came when he came uh when he came in the time of Noah and you know that deliverance the god of deliverance was the god of judgment at the same time the same water that delivered the people was the same water that destroyed the others you follow that so it was important now he's coming a mighty messenger coming descending with the covenant with the word and it's not now just sending someone but it's the person himself his face is is once again identified because it's his person his own personal presence that is coming will be there and he has to have because he's not coming into a physical body like he did when he was born of a virgin but he's coming now to use a redeemed vessel so he comes through a prophet messenger in the end time and that is why that is I brother Brandham had to say for 30 33 years that's not me that's him. Had to keep saying it. It's not me it's him. Why did he have to say that? Because the people could feel that strange that fain almost un unearly presence. He wanted them to know that's not me. That's not just some mystic. That's him. &gt;&gt; That's the resurrected Christ. I can prove to you that he's here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not I can prove to you he's coming. I can prove to you that he's present. He was saying &gt;&gt; and that's the word we've believed. That's the word that's unveiled him. That's the word that you if you believe in it, you'll come to know him in reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the feet and the face speak of exactly the same. The revelation of Jesus Christ is to see. The revelation of Jesus Christ is to see the very face of God. And to see him is to receive him. To see him, I'm repeating, is to either receive him or to reject him. To receive him is life and to reject him is death. There's no way around it. Jacob wrestled with the angel and God changed his name. a person's life, his life, his character from Jacob to Israel. It's really quite uh uh it's quite interesting. In fact, is it's mentally challenging to think of the times that Jacob was referred to in the New Testament. And he's they always call him Jacob, but Jacob was changed. The whole nation of people that came out of him, for out of him came the patriarchs, and out of them came the whole nation. And that is why they call it Israel. That's how come Israel is called Israel. It's called the land of Israel. It's the land of Jacob. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the land of the patriarchs. That's what came out of him. It's the land of the birthright. &gt;&gt; That was his birthright &gt;&gt; to bring forth. Got to keep myself or I'll be going ahead of what I want to get to. So, Jacob received the blessing. Now the Bible says uh the Bible says that of him that you have prevailed that Jacob has prevailed and because he prevailed he is a a prince and he prevailed the scripture your name will be no more Jacob for as a prince thou hast power with God and with man and hast prevailed. Don't you find it a paradox? This is a man that just been running from his troubles. This is a man who just sent his wives and their children across the creek, across the river ahead of him. This is a man who just sent a few hundred animals as a gift to his brother because he feels his brother's going to kill him or do some damage. is a man. He still knows but he has an abiding knowledge. He has abiding faith that I have the birthrightmen. &gt;&gt; I have the inheritance. That's going to be very very very important as we move through the rest of the message. So he he had received the blessing but yet in another sense and I want you to follow me very closely. Jacob had prevailed. But in another sense, it was God that had actually prevailed. God had prevailed in bringing him to a place and into an experience that changed him. Up to that moment, he was a shyster. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Up to that moment, he was a deceiver. Up to that moment, he contrived. He deceived his brother. He conceived his his daddy who was a prophet. He deceived all the people around him. He he was a he was a deceiver. He just had that uh kind of nature with him. But at that moment he was changed. And by being changed he could come into the lineage and the fatherhood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So God had prevailed. God had prevailed in advancing the mystery that he was unfolding out of the eternities that of Christ, this anointing which I've been speaking about in advancing the whole program of redemption. And God was not going to change his mind. God was going to be the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. That's all there was to it. God was going to be the God of those and that was going to be the foundation and out of Jacob it couldn't change. He had to bring forth the patriarchs. You agree with that? &gt;&gt; When I say that, I want you to also be able to personalize it and internalize it for your own self that God who brought you here and has a purpose in your life, he's not going to change his mind about that. &gt;&gt; He's going to do what he's going to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want to surrender. &gt;&gt; I want to dedicate myself to God's program &gt;&gt; rather than have our program. &gt;&gt; And so God prevailed. It says that Jacob prevailed and and indeed he did. But God prevailed in advancing his great unfolding of his mystery uh in revealing of Christ and bringing forth Christ. In a message identified masterpiece of God the prophet said and Jacob which means surppler and that's a deceiver and we realize that Jacob's life really represented grace because it was grace of God all the time with Jacob. So it was a it was a it's a really a a a I'll say a unique combination when we can find and we need that we need that believe me even in this last week as I spent time alone with God I'm so conscious that you know we're unworthy people &gt;&gt; we're unworthy servants we we need the cleansing all the time &gt;&gt; we need the grace of God every day. &gt;&gt; We just can't live one day without the grace of God being extended to us. We absolutely are in dire need of the grace of God. And I'm glad so glad that we don't have to do anything to earn it because if we if we had some penance or we had some some activity that we did to try to earn it no more. It would be no more grace. I'm just glad that God gives a grace. &gt;&gt; By grace he gives us what we have need of. And then the prophet in the message my redeemer liveth he said he walked different Jacob did what he used to walk because one night he came in contact with an angel of God and the angel touched his hip and made him walk different. He had and here's what I want you to uh register please. He had an evidence that he had been a hold of God and God had been a hold of him. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He had a different walk. &gt;&gt; And I trust we all have experienced that. &gt;&gt; And if we have not say, "God, make my walk different." &gt;&gt; I look down this congregation and I know the lives of many of you and I know that you got a hold of God. And I know that God got a hold of you because something happened and you were a changed creature. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The things I used to do, I do them no more. Not because we had some reformation, because we had a transformation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen to your testimony, Sister Lana. I and my wife, and we're so blessed to hear it again and to hear things we hadn't heard before. And this is what they're producing. some from the congregation right here. It's called Our Stories and it's wonderful. You want to get the DVD of Sister Lana's testimony and what God brought her from and how God preserved how God preserved you, how God brought you to this place. It's nothing but the grace of almighty God that God would even open your eyes. Look where you came from and where you are today. And many of you have been here many many years in the grace of God and the peace of God and the preservation of God. &gt;&gt; You know where this message has come from? It's come from a prayer that I've been praying sometime. I would like to be able to I wish I could show the people on a screen how I see the enemy sweep in and attempt to destroy lives and cut them down. Attempt to destroy families and cut them down. Attempt to destroy ministries not only here but elsewhere and cut them down mercilessly. And I haven't had I haven't had a lot of words, but I have I want to say to this assembly as your brother, I've just prayed one thing. Preserve us. &gt;&gt; Preserve us, oh God. &gt;&gt; Preserve us in these violent times. &gt;&gt; Preserve us in these wicked times. Amen. &gt;&gt; Preserve us from this temptation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why it meant so much to me, brother Jake, standing in the hospital room with the body of Sister Mina on the bed and just Brother Jake alone early in the morning and my wife and I went there and he began to tell me. He said she was not very responsive. She was sitting in her chair at home and he said her hand was just moving like this on on the arm of the chair. And he said, "This is the other part of the story, Brother Jake. This is your part and I'll tell you my part." He said, "What are you doing?" She said, "She's writing." What are you writing? Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. And I had been praying just over the last days when I see the enemy sweep in and he wants to cut people down. He wants to destroy. He wants to shatter lives. He'd like to just shatter everything. I just said, "God, preserve us. Preserve us." And then you hear a little rumor, you know, because I'm kind of the center control where central where everything comes through. You hear about this young person, you hear about that family, you hear about this fellow, hear about that man, hear about this woman, hear about them. He just gets so he can't hardly carry anymore. I only look up and say, "Preserve us. &gt;&gt; Preserve us, oh God. &gt;&gt; Preserve our young people. &gt;&gt; Preserve our families. &gt;&gt; Preserve our congregations. &gt;&gt; Preserve our ministry. Preserve us. Oh God, can you say that with me? Preserve us." And I went to the scripture &gt;&gt; and I read about Jacob says, "And I saw God face to face and my life is preserved." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "Father, that's exactly it. in this day and in this age, my my mind went immediately to the message of this hour. And knowing that this was the this is the age of his presence. This is the age of his countenance. This is the age of his. And if we haven't seen it, it's our problem. Then we need to say, God, clear my vision. &gt;&gt; Clear my eyesight. Take the veil away. Remove the dimness from me. Take the shades away that I might see you clearly because I know by your word. I know by the message of the hour. This is the day of your presence. This is the day of your visitation. This is the day when you're here to look and I can see you face to face. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; If you don't see them, it's not a failure on God's part. It might be that our expectation is not where it should be. It might be where our focus is not where it should be. And so he said that Jacob from that moment had the time, had the evidence that he'd been a hold of God and God had been a hold of him, had gotten a hold of him. And he says when he was getting ready to die down in Egypt, he said with that inspiration before the resurrection, give him a a measure before the resurrection said, I know that something's going to happen yonder. a promised land in the promised land one of these days. So upon the the very place that this inspiration he said come here my boy Joseph that was a prophet his prophet come here my son Joseph which was a prophet he said come here and lay your hand on this wrestled the place where I have been. So now he's years later he's taking his son Joseph said lay your hand still remembering this is the evidence I have my life has been changed my life been transformed I still remember that I go back to that place that's a good thing to do and he said Joseph lay your hand right here on this place and swear to me by the God of heaven that you will not bury me down here swear that you won't bury me here for he knew that was essential that he was gathered with his people. He knew that he must be gathered with his people and I must not be buried here in Egypt. And so they took his bones and put them. He said, "My life is preserved." Now taking an important turning an important corner here in the message. My life is preserved. Jacob's life not according to his material things but his life according to the blessing and according to the promise. His life was preserved. When you think of what your life is and if I asked you to tell me what really comprises your life. Probably the most of it would be something that would be and I want to use two words tangible and intangible. visible and invisible, seen, material, physical and immaterial, invisible and unseen. And if I asked you to say to me, tell me what really makes up your life. You might have a whole range of things. You might say, "Well, uh, the love of my family, the special relationship that I have with this, my husband, my wife, or my family, my children. What makes up my life is the experiences I've had with God that have brought me to this place to where I am now. &gt;&gt; All of those are intangible. All of those are very very difficult to define because you can't put your hand on them. something that's tangible. If you look up the word, it is something that you can touch. And intangible is something that you cannot touch. You can't lay your hand on it. I began to think about our spiritual life and and uh what really makes up our spiritual life. And uh most of the things in the scripture have reference to in our a believer's life is largely the unseen. Now brother Brandham talks about the senses the senses of the body. He said and you've been given these five senses to contact this world. So you have them. He did something interesting as well. He picked a man out of the congregation. Said, "Now here's a man. He's in a gray suit. He's got a striped tie on." He said, "It's a little larger than myself." He said, "Now, uh, I can't touch that man. I'm I I'm not able to touch him, but he says, but my sight declares him." So I have a sense that declares him. I'm looking at brother Ernie just now. So my sight declares him even though my touch does not declare him. My other senses don't declare him but my sight declares him. Then he moved and he says now my sight doesn't declare him but I still know that he's there. My sight doesn't declare him. Now now there's no he can't touch him. He can't see him. He can't hear him. Doesn't smell him. Doesn't taste him. None of the senses declare that he's there. But he says, "But I know that he's there." &gt;&gt; And that's how faith is. &gt;&gt; These senses were not made to contact the supernatural. &gt;&gt; They're not made for it. Oh, I felt it. Well, that's that's fine. Happy you felt it, but it wasn't it's not what we're talking about. &gt;&gt; Oh, I heard I heard a voice. I heard. I saw a flash of light. Fine. Too many people put their anchor their faith on that. That's not faith. It's what you don't see, what you don't hear, what you don't smell, you don't taste. The body's not affected by it whatsoever, but you know it's there. &gt;&gt; How do you know? Well, I wrestled. &gt;&gt; I had a great wrestle. I'd been trained in a certain way. I I believed a certain thing and I had a wrestle with a man uh with the angel of God and it left me with a different walk. I was changed from that moment. I got up out of that place and I was a different person from then on. I've had lots of struggles. I've had lots of battles. But I was changed. &gt;&gt; Every person needs that. Every man and woman needs that. Every young person needs that. If you haven't had that meeting, you need to meet that angel of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Who is it? It's the angel of the covenant. You need to meet Revelation 10:1. You need to meet him. You need to meet him in his power and in his holiness and in his presence. Oh, you say, "How will I know that I met him?" You won't be able to shake it off. You won't be able not to know. Do you hear me? You won't be able not to know. You'll meet him and you'll be transformed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And seeing Sister Lana's testimony really spoke to me because I was right on the on the line of this in my message. When God begins to deal with you, I don't care where you're at. I don't care what your position. You can be in in hell's darkest hole, &gt;&gt; but when God begins to deal with you and he begins to put things in your mind, you can't get rid of those things for nothing. They're just with you all the time. You can be in in a you can be in the darkest place on earth. You can be in the deepest of of sins of of sin's blackness, but you cannot get that off your mind. That's all you think about. You just think about it. and you can't shake it off because God's dealing with you. Then when you finally surrender and give in, when you finally lay it all down, oh my, how glorious it is. It's a birth and it's a mess. &gt;&gt; I like to see births that are a mess. &gt;&gt; I like to see people wallow in their tears. I like to see them repent. Oh, you say, "Well, a lot of people have tears, but they don't they don't really come to Christ." That is true. A lot of people repent for a whole lot of reasons and I'm not going to go into it. You want me to? &gt;&gt; People repent because they get caught. People are cry because they get caught. &gt;&gt; That's not repentance. &gt;&gt; People cry because they they they've tried something else and doesn't work. Woohoo. It doesn't work. &gt;&gt; So that's your problem. &gt;&gt; I'm not being difficult. But when a man the the scripture says that it is the goodness of God. There's two scriptures that I always stand on. The goodness of God leads a man to repentance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And godly sorrow workketh repentance. Godly sorrow. We're sorry for our sin. We're sorry for our mistakes. We're sorry for our unbelief. That's why I don't have much of well if I hurt you that's not the thing. If I offended you that's not a repentance. It's say I did wrong and I'm sorry for it. I said something and God has spoken to me and I'm sorry for it. I should not have said that. I should not have done that. That's repentance. So we have now the visible and the invisible, the seen and the unseen, the tangible and the intangible things. And I can tell you that Jacob became a very very great man in the in his time. And he had thousands of cattle and thousands of flocks of sheep and goats and camels and herds of animals and so on. He had children. He had his wives with him and servants and all of these things. You will not find any place in the scripture where he's contriving to gain. Well, you say, "Well, what about when he was working for Laban?" Listen, he tells Laban when he meets him, Laban follows after him, chases him, and catches him. I think seven days journey or so. They had already left three days and he finally caught him and said, "Why did you take my gods?" etc. And they search for everything. Can't find the gods. It was Rachel that had taken one of her father's gods and hid it. But anyway, uh Jacob says to Laban, he said, "I served you." He says, "What do you mean? You know that these are your cattle and everything I have is yours." He said, "I served you so many years for my wives. I served you." He said, "And you changed my wages 10 times." And and and and the the cattle that I was to receive, they were if they were a a scrubby one and a sickly one, that's what I got. And then and then if they were string raaked or or whatever, marked a certain way, he got all the marked cattle. And and and then God told them how to put the rods in front of the the eyes of the animals while they were while they were conceiving. And and here the cattle came and they were all marked and they were odd kind of oddball cattle and that all became his. And anytime one of Jacob's one of Laban's cattle was sick and died, he made Laban he made Jacob replace it. Anything that was torn by animals and killed, he made Jacob replace it. And so Jacob, Jacob's focus and his thrust in life was not to attain. I'm laying a big foundation here, but his focus in life was not to better himself in life. God just did it. &gt;&gt; In fact is whatever God wants to do, he'll just do it. As long as we have our correct perspective, as long as we have our correct focus, as long as we have God's spiritual agenda, then we leave everything else. Sometimes, you know, we tend to look upon another say, "Oh my, why are they blessed? Oh, why? What do they do? What what do they do? How come they're doing so well?" That has nothing to do with that. You got your eyes on the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; Your eyes need to be on one thing. is what is God's main purpose in this life? What is God's main agenda? &gt;&gt; Whether you say amen or not, I'm going to preach it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; What I'm saying about Jacob is what I'm saying about us. Jacob's trouble only started after he got the birthight. That's where his trouble really started. And the birthright in its entirety is intangible completely. Something he can't define. It's just something out there. &gt;&gt; Hey, you talk about your theophony. Show me your theophony. &gt;&gt; You talk about, oh, I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go to prepare a place for you, I'll come again and take you. I I got a home. Show me the home. Tell me the home. It's all intangible. You believe this message. Believe this word. Show me your faith. Show me your believing. Show it to me. So, well, you know what you're going to end up with? You're going to end up at the end of this service saying, "I can't really I can't really prove anything. I don't have anything tangible to lay my hand to and say, this is really what I believe." That's why people, you know, they like to take medals and idols and so on so forth. And that is why the even the children of Israel, that's why they said to Moses, you know, give us this calf. We want to we want to identify something and say, "These be the gods that brought you." We want to be able to lay our hands on something and say, "This is the blessing of God. I really come home this morning say how people come here in this church and I don't care what other people throughout the message think about this church is oh yeah big church worth millions of dollars blessing my goodness I don't even think about that when I come in this place I'm just glad glad we got a place to sit in and glad we got a place to worship glad I have people come around you know what I don't even take a lot of people around because I they get start googling Oh. Oh. And they see the big switchboards up there or whatever more. I don't even know. Some some people buy it. The trustees buy it or somebody says something. This is what we need. That's what we need. So they go ahead and get it. Say h how's it paid? I don't know. God gave somehow and the people gave and that's what happened. But somebody out there this this God's work. When the church was very very young, just a handful were there. My some of my own daughters came to me and they were all disturbed and troubled because it looked like some of the young people, one or two of them were slipping away. I said, "Dad, dad, you know, this is happening. Dad, dad," I said, "Hey, just a second. These are God's sheep, sir, and if he can't keep them, I sure can't." Well, this one's slipping away and that one's slipping away. I say, if God can't keep them, if they've been here, sometimes people been here and they hear the word, they've been here for years. They know exactly what the word of God says. They know exactly what the message says, but they're determined to go their own way. Up to them. Down the road is a lot of trouble. &gt;&gt; Down the road is a lot of heartache. And the trouble is so many times years later they come back. The woman might be in the service this morning. Just about three weeks ago, I sat in my office with a woman and she took counsel from me 23 years ago. And I said, "Don't do it. Don't do it. It's wrong. It's against the word. It's against the message." But it was something that she felt she needed in her life. She would get a companion. She would get a home. And so she went and did it. It involved a marriage. About three weeks ago, she asked for a meeting, sat in my office, and her first word says, "I've been in the wilderness for 23 years. Can I come back? It's the only woman I ever put out of the church. Just can I come back? Have you repented? Oh, have I repented? 23 years. 23 years gone. Kind of a big vacant space. You know friends say so what is the problem brother Ed? The problem was got the vision on the physical on the natural and lost the vision on the spiritual. Where am I headed now? I want to come to another scripture. I want you to hold that right there, please. The scripture says, "While we look not at the things, While we look not at the things that are seen, While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. &gt;&gt; Can I read that again? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Would you like to turn in your Bible and read it with me? &gt;&gt; Turn to second Corinthians the 4th chapter. 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter and it is verse 18. And let us read it together, shall we? While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. The key word here, the key word, and this is really where I want to focus the message is while we look. Look, that word is actually has two aspects to the word and I need to kind of demonstrate it for you. While we look not at the things which are seen and the and and and the word key, the word that is key here is this word look. And I just want to get I had it I have it here for you. It is to do this that we do not look to observe to fix one's eyes upon to direct one's attention to or having regard for a thing. In other words, and it also means to to to turn or to be separated from. So there's two things that happen here when we look say we look so we turn and we focus here and we look on a certain thing in order to do that we have to be we separate we essentially that's what the word is speaking of we actually separate while we turn because it assumes we are looking at something so while we look not so we look not to look said Look here. We So we we actually it's not just a change of direction, but it's actually a change of focus. What we were concentrating on here, what we were spending our energy on here, now we change the focus and we look over here. What Apostle Paul, he's not saying we're not in this world anymore. He's not saying we don't have bills to pay anymore. He's not saying we don't have a life to live and we don't have we don't have to make our way. He's not saying that. But what he's saying is that we don't focus on this. We don't look on this. In fact is he's saying be separate separated from that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we can't be divided. And that's what Jesus said. We can't serve God and mammon. Can't serve them. Can't serve both. It doesn't say that mammon doesn't exist. Says we can't serve them. &gt;&gt; We can't be focused on them. That can't be our attention. That can't be what consumes us. That can't be what occupies us night and day. It can't be that. It has to be what is invisible. &gt;&gt; What does the invisible declare to you today? Where are you going to place the importance? If I understand what a prophet says, he says, "Right beside you is a theophony." Listen to me. You mean at the time of this short breath on life, we're going to take just a breath expire from here. People will weep maybe over our remains and you're going to be in another body. &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't we be focused on that? &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't we be focused that if this body be dissolved, we have another in the heavens, eternal aonian. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why shouldn't that occupy us? Why shouldn't we be thinking about that? Why shouldn't we be thinking about where we're going? Not to spend 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 years. Where we're going to spend eternity, where we're going to be at home, not where we're going to be with a few people here at Cloverdale Bible, but where we're going to be with the saints of old. &gt;&gt; You people have said to me, "Oh, you're so privileged. You say you were with the prophet of God. You were with brother Brandham." What happens if I tell you this morning? You're going to see him. You're going to be there. You're not going to be in a weakened body. You're not going to be struggling with life. You're not going to have weaknesses. You're going to be there. You're going to see the Lord Jesus. You're going to see the apostles. You're going to see the saints. You're going to see the martyrs. You're going to be with them forever. &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't that be our focus? Amen. &gt;&gt; And the things of life, the things that are natural, if we strain and we struggle and we want to get a little higher, we want to get I'm not saying don't pay your bills. I'm not saying don't don't appreciate your your raise or whatever happens or a better car you get or whatever more. That's not our focus. &gt;&gt; If it just so happens, if it happens, let it happen. If the camels increase, let them increase. &gt;&gt; If the house increases, let it increase. &gt;&gt; Whatever happens, that's not our focus. &gt;&gt; It might go down. &gt;&gt; And I have a message coming on God's economy. &gt;&gt; And it'll be a startle to a lot of people. &gt;&gt; So what? say, "Oh, I had people come by my place years ago and said, "Your house is worth $90,000." Well, of course, that's a chuckle today cuz that's not even the price of a lot. And I think I think I had around 50 50,000 in the place that I built, 57,000 or something. Says, "Oh, your place worth 90,000." Well, well, it's just a roof. I I got to live here. That was my realization. And I even told him maybe I put in my hands like spiritual Jews. I don't know. I said, "So it's worth 90,000." What? So what? &gt;&gt; But I said, you know, and I I I had a realization if I if I sell it for 90, I got to pay 90 for some piece of junk across the road. &gt;&gt; So that's that's nothing. And they came back said, "Oh, your place's worth 130,000." So, so I still have to have a place to live. &gt;&gt; It doesn't do anything for me. And they come back and say, "Oh, it's gone down. It's only worth 110." So, &gt;&gt; and I finally decided a long time ago, I'm not the one who's setting the price. Some guys in the government or some economist or some who control inflation or the Federal Reserve Bank or whoever else and I don't care about them. &gt;&gt; So, oh, now you're worth this. Okay. now. Oh, the economy's busting. Now you're only worth this. You're broke. So, I'm still here. &gt;&gt; And it so happens that we got a whole another focus. I'm looking to the unseen. &gt;&gt; Are you crazy? Yeah, I'm crazy. I'm looking to the unseen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I see in the unseen realm. &gt;&gt; I got another sense. A real one &gt;&gt; more than this feeling. I got another sense. more than my taste and more than my smelling and more than my hearing and more than my sight. I have another sense. It's called a sense of faith. &gt;&gt; And this word of God says that faith is substance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is substance. &gt;&gt; I got my hand on it. I got my spiritual grip on it. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't change. You need your vision on that on that unseen, the intangible, the untouchable. You can't touch it. Thank God I can't touch it. And neither can the devil touch it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the economists can't touch it. And the politicians can't touch it. And the religious order can't touch it. Nobody can touch it. It's a sacred secret between God and me and God and you. while we look not. &gt;&gt; And for the congregation this morning and all that hear me, there's a great need in this Leodysian age and within the message to actually we've been plagued by something and what we're plagued by is trying to have a foot in both worlds. What we're plagued with is trying to hang on to the one while we're trying to see the other. &gt;&gt; What we're plagued with is a divi a division in our focus. We're here and then we're here. &gt;&gt; We're here and then we're here. &gt;&gt; Doesn't work. &gt;&gt; Just doesn't work. We got to have our focus on and and this isn't going to go away. The church will still be here for you to these seats will be here, Lord willing, next time you need them to come and sit in them. Your house will be there whatever more and God will see you through it. &gt;&gt; Through the good times, through the bad times. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jacob was not striving and neither should we to increase his goats, increases sheep, increase his what? Let me tell you something, friends. There's people in this country, I got to handhold myself back a wee bit. There's people in this country when I was a uh just a young we were young family and are they come in with a grand announcement. This is a this is a smart people. This is the smart people. The grand announcement. Can I tell you just a little personal things? &gt;&gt; Does it help you? &gt;&gt; The smart people. The people are in control of thing. I'm we're not in control. People are in control of things. said, "We're going to allow you to put a little money away every year, and this will be for your retirement." Oh, it sounds so good. Retirement. I think a lot about that these days. Retirement. So, they let you put a little away and you don't have to pay tax on it. Oh, that is so my the government is so nice. Thank you for thinking of me. so kindly. So we put the money away and then the next year you put a little more away and the next year a little more and then finally things, you know, they go like this in the world up and down and in and out and back and forth. And then when you're done, you get to be my age and you find out what you put away. Won't even keep you in an old folks home for the next 12 months. just won't keep you. And here they've been enticing you all these years. Let me tell you another one. They take take off your salary. Take off your I'm talking about the things that we've been focused on. They take off your salary. It's called in Canada CPP, Canadian Pension Plan. and they take it off every every paycheck every year. I've put into it all my life. I started working when I was 15 before they even had it. And then as soon as they instituted, I've been paying ever since because I never see it. They take it off. It's yours, but they take it to look after it for you cuz you can't look after it. You're too dumb. We, the smart guys, we'll look after it. So they look after it and then God blesses me with health. And when I'm supposed to retire, I still I don't want to retire. I keep working. So I just keep going. They say, "Oh, you're still working. You can't have this." &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; Well, who's going to have it? Oh, we're Never mind. Don't ask those questions. We're going to keep it. &gt;&gt; You are? Yeah. can't see a penny of it. And then you know what they said? Oh, you reached a certain age and uh we're going to send you a check. Well, the check right now wouldn't even buy gas for my car. &gt;&gt; And then they decided they learned, "Oh, you're still working. We're going to take that check back, too." And it's called grabbing back. You know what? I have a philosophy. So what? &gt;&gt; They never gave me my health in the first place. They never gave me salvation in the first place. They never gave me the promises of God in the first place. I got the promises of God which are far more. And so they tell you one time, "Oh, this is a oh, this is a wonderful thing." Don't have your eye on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't count on it being wonderful cuz I guarantee you the direction the world is going is not going to be not to treat you like like you're a special child. &gt;&gt; No, they won't. &gt;&gt; Now that'll have you nice and silent. That's just kind of an introduction to God's economy. God has an economy also. &gt;&gt; God has an economy also. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; You know where I learned some of my lessons? The old brother from Portland, Oregon, he and his wife, which took I and my wife, they saw something in us. I don't know what they saw, but they saw something in us and invited us. They said, you know, they they felt that I should be in the ministry. So, they opened the door and we went before we had any children. My wife became pregnant carrying Linda while we were in meetings and we had to go back so that she'd be born. My wife was carrying a second child, Marilyn, while we were in meetings. And we were in meetings night after night after night. And then we had to go all the way back 1500 miles so the child could be born. This was our life at that time. And we were staying with them in a little wee tiny house. And he bought this. He bought this as a shack, one-bedroom shack. And he says, "I want to build on to it." He had a gift to do things in a special way. He said, "I want to build on to it." And and he had told me, he said, "Ed," he said, "I have brothers and they worked their fingers to the bone. One is gold mining in Alaska. Another one is over in Yakama. and they spend their time working their fingers to the bone to increase and to get wealth and so on so forth. He says, "And I have as much as any of them have and spent his whole life preaching the gospel." Spending his whole life and I saw the man make incredible sacrifices and refuse and turn down lucrative lucrative things. They asked him to build the the the monument arch over President Roosevelt's where his son was killed, their only son in the state of Alaska on a in a plane crash. And they said, "We've built a we built a road about 60 miles." He says, "I'm too busy preaching to the native Indian people." He said, "No, you don't understand." He said, "We don't care what you charge. We build a road 60 miles. charge anything you want. We've looked at several pieces of stonework and we want you to do it. He said, "Well, I can't do it. I'll go and have a look at it and tell you how it should be." So, he drove out with them and he says, "This is the way you have the arch and this is what should be." He designed the whole thing, you know, said this way, you know, and and and then he said, "Well, you're going to do it, aren't you?" "No, I'm not going to do it." Said, "We don't care what you charge. Name your price. we want you to do it. He said, "No, I won't do it. I'm too busy." I learned things from that man. I learned that he was seeing something else. &gt;&gt; And so I helped him in this shack in this house. And I'll never forget, excuse me for being so personal today, but I'll never forget he had the power saw laying at his feet, standing right out in front of this wall. We got a bunch of builders and carpenters here. None of you like this fellow. He said, you know, he said, "We want to build this room out from here," he said. And he picked up that saw and he he looked the corner of the wall and he said, "I think we should cut in right about here." And he just buzzed right up that cut the whole front end of his house out. And I, my dad was a carpenter. I thought, "Wow, you know, there's something else." He's just cutting right in right into his home. Cutting the whole wall out with no measurement, no line, no nothing. He just going up the wall, cut the whole wall out, fixed up this beautiful room and he built a fireplace in it and I was helping and he just designed it and because it was cute, people fell in love with it. But this just a place where they could have between meetings, they had to have a place, a roof over his head. He didn't care. it is no interest to him what it's worth. That had no he didn't know we're going to do it and make some money. That wasn't in his mind at all. We just need a roof over our head &gt;&gt; so we can come back and be at home. And pretty soon knock on the door came. Says, "Where was the Department of Transport?" He's way out in the boondock south of Portland towards Tigert. He says, "And here come uh here come people from the Department of Transport." They said, "There's a big freeway coming from the I5 here, and it's cutting over here to Beaverton, and it's coming right through this area, and we need a big area for a freeway uh corridor, and it so happens that the corridor comes across the back of your property. If it didn't touch your house, then you'd be home free. Unfortunately, it just cuts the corner off your roof. Just a corner. It doesn't touch the building. It just the hangover of the roof and it just clips it. So they says, "So we have to buy the house from you." Says, "We don't want to sell the house. You have to. And then what we'll do is when we buy the house, you have to move out the property that is not used. We take the house and we sell it by auction and then the house will be moved by the person who buys it and you will have the remaining property and whatever we don't have and haven't taken from you, you will have that. So fine, it was a big hassle. So they oh we do we need this because it's in our way. He was so busy just wanting to have meetings, wanting to work for God. That's all his whole life was getting people saved. That was his whole ministry. So now they have to move out. They move out just go in a motor home or something and go to the auction to buy the house because they sent people there and he had all this stone big stone fireplace. So appraiser comes in says we don't know how to praise this place. How's anybody going to move all this stonework? They sent two other fellas. They come and look at it and the lady next door wasn't even getting enough to pay her mortgage. They weren't getting anything. Here's a man who's giving his whole life. Has no focus, no attention on natural things whatsoever. None. Zero. Believe me, I spent some years living with them and learned some things, things I've never shared with you. I'm sharing this with you. And finally, they said, "We're going to give you 25,000 for this house." and we'll sell it at the auction. So he gave him 25,000 cash, a lot of money back in the 1950s. Yes, sir. And he goes to the auction. He's sitting there. They'll wonder what they're going to get for this place because they can't move all this stone fireplace and stuff. He sits in the auction and buys the house for 800 and went and got his stuff and moved back in because the land that they didn't need fell back to him and he stayed in the same house was just out for a few days and had 24,200 in his pocket. I say, "Praise God. I like that kind of economy." Now, did he figure that out? No, he never figured that out. God figured that out. Yes. &gt;&gt; But what was his vision on? His vision wasn't I'm going to do this. I'm going to make a big bunch of money and so on. That wasn't consuming him. He couldn't care less. &gt;&gt; You understand? Because there has to come a time. We turn from this. We turn from this apple. We turn from this and look over here. And what is over here? The invisible, &gt;&gt; the unintable, the immaterial, the thing I can't touch but the thing I believe in. And my faith, which God loves, &gt;&gt; touches that. &gt;&gt; My faith lays a hold of that. &gt;&gt; That is my eternal purpose. That's my eternal home. That consumes me. &gt;&gt; That's what I think about when I get up. That's what I think about when I'm shaving in the morning. That's what I think about all my time is thinking about that. &gt;&gt; But Satan's got this life engineered to get your mind to captivate it on a whole bunch of other things. And at the end of the day, it's a waste. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And &gt;&gt; I really have an opposition to it because I see it. It just almost causes a person to become expire their strength and their energy and just become so weary struggling with the things of life. I tell you what to do. Turn away from it. &gt;&gt; I need to hear a bigger amen to that. Turn away from it. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And you'll come to a rest. &gt;&gt; You'll come to a peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not that we become dilatory. It's not that we become careless. God intends us to be careful stewards of what he gives us, but we're not striving or spending our time creating a larger herd or a larger bank account or this or that is. Just be diligent with what God gives you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're working for somebody, give him his time. &gt;&gt; Be diligent. Be the best employee there is on the street. Be the most Be the most diligent person with financial matters. Just be diligent with the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Just give me a couple more moments &gt;&gt; because you may think, well, where's this in the message? This is pretty elementary. It's very important. &gt;&gt; The seals now came to be open. And I have to give you this before I close. The seals were about to be open. Now, here's the messenger on earth. A a prophet messenger 30 years looking into the invisible. Do you see that light? He couldn't believe that people couldn't see that light. I read this morning, he said, "I see you." He said, "Does anybody know this woman?" Some hands went up. He said, "Thank you. Are we strangers?" Total strangers. I said, "I see you. You be I see you becoming a young woman again. Where's he looking?" That's the only way he could help her. That's the only way she could get faith in her heart is by a prophet looking into the invisible and seeing. And now comes a time because all of the healing, all the supernatural, all the vindication isn't bringing a bride forth. &gt;&gt; Thought you'd catch that. &gt;&gt; All of that, all that feeling, all of that, you sense the presence. You know you're not in the presence. Even that didn't bring a bride forth. How many people have you run into said, "Well, I stood in front of the prophet and I felt that incredible mighty presence and it just consumed me. It just it just changed my life." Do you ever meet one? Do you know why? Cuz that's not it. &gt;&gt; Did they feel it? Yes, they felt it. Did they tremble? Yes, they trembled. Did they put their hand on the pulpit to steady themselves? Yes, they did. But did did it bring them to the word birth? No. &gt;&gt; And I don't know exactly why. Don't look. I say to this congregation, the name of the Lord, stop looking for the physical, supernatural, emotional. Stop living in an emotional realm. &gt;&gt; Well, I feel good. I don't feel good. That has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; Your natural desires and your emotional things has nothing to do with the kingdom of God. And now God has a messenger says now I'm going to I'm going to open the seals. I'm going to open what's been in the bosom of God through this eternities and uh you you go and if you read if you will read Is this the time, sir? Is this the time of the end, sir? And Junior Jackson has a dream. And he interprets the dream. And he says, I was standing and he asked Juny, calls him Juny, said, "Didn't I I I had my hand up there and I I I took something like a bar or something sharp." Yeah, that's right. And and cleaved off the top of this mountain. Yeah, that's right. And it was white stone. There was stone there and things were written in the stone. But the sun, not the su n, but the s o n had never shone on that. It was written. There's mysteries, secrets, things that had been who made the mountains. God raised them up. What is this all referring to? It's referring to the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; And there was things that were written there. And no man had ever seen this. The sun had never shone on it. He says, "And I was to interpret this to the brethren to the brothers and there was a bunch of ministers around." He said, "And and and the the one that was with him said to him as a prophet messenger, look on this." He says, "And I said to the ministers that were standing around me, look on this." And then I left and went and I go over a hill, down a valley, over a hill, down valley, and begin to go west, which is what he did. came to Arizona. I was going west, &gt;&gt; he says. And then the ministers, some went this way, some went that way, some went another way, and very few stayed and looked on what I said. &gt;&gt; The looking was the key to everything in the future. And those that went this way and went that way did so because they had other things they got attached to and failed to stay and look on what he said. &gt;&gt; And then he comes comes actually to the opening of the seals and in the seventh seal he comes all the way back and details and relates that whole thing again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and told the people, "Look on this &gt;&gt; at the end." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Are you catching what I'm saying? Look on this. &gt;&gt; Don't figure it out. Just look on it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the first seal was opened and a horse rider, a living creature, a horse rider rode out, but a living creature, a living, it was called a beast. The beast said, but there's two different I want to won't have time to get into it now, but the the beast was a living creature. The prophet said it was an anointing that came down in every age. And he said, "And the beast said, the seal was opened, and the living creature cried out, come and see." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Those are two things. And if you look carefully now, just for a moment, and I'm winding up. If you look carefully at every move of God for Moses or say for the Lord Jesus, the first part of his ministry was a ministry that caused people to come to come and they came and it attracted the people. And the prophet said in the ministry which was the revealing of Jesus Christ for 30 years the ministry attracted the people. The signs attracted the people. The wonders attracted the people. So what did they do? They all came. &gt;&gt; Thousands came. Hundreds of thousands into the millions came. Then come another part of the ministry which was the unveiling &gt;&gt; of the God that was speaking. Notice, notice, please carefully. Well, I'm just trying to close up. Moses comes down to the people. I'm on the same thought. Moses comes down to the people said, "I met God in a burning bush." A supernatural thing. I met him in a burning bush and this is what he said and now I'm down here. He said, "Who is he?" Says, "I am that I am." And Moses then begins to manifest this one in the invisible, intangible, immaterial God that spoke to him in a voice. And to prove that he met this God and this God had called and spoke to him, to prove it, plagues begin to come. When the plagues came, something the people could touch and feel and understand, something that affected them physically, they began to see it. And then they would respond to Moses, "Go and tell your God, take it away, and we'll let the people go." And God would hear and take it away. But the people the people to them it had a it had a compelling power and attracted them &gt;&gt; to come. &gt;&gt; You might wonder maybe why the woman didn't continue to walk out of the wheelchair. I tell you what that happened or they had a bigger crowd there. A bigger crowd of what? &gt;&gt; A bigger crowd of who? You understand? &gt;&gt; And here come the big crowds and some more plagues and some more plagues. 10 plagues. And those people were completely in alignment with Moses. Moses is our man. Oh, Moses is this great prophet. &gt;&gt; They're going to hear Moses. They only got into the wilderness a short distance and they forgot all about him. &gt;&gt; And we don't even know what happened to this Moses. They went up in the mountain. They've been 400 years in bondage. Not not willing to wait 40 days. &gt;&gt; I find that is still a human weakness today. Person can live a life and be before the people all the years and then some maybe some infraction maybe not some infraction but some disappointment said well I'm disappointed. And so the people became disappointed in Moses for whatever reason but they had come out. They had come out. Watch closely. They came out. They did the coming uh being attracted to that first part. Come &gt;&gt; and see. &gt;&gt; And then Moses met God and came down. And for the first time when he spoke the word, they could now see who it was. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. And he begins to lay the word down. Now they had God defined in word form &gt;&gt; and they couldn't take it. &gt;&gt; The plagues call them to come. But when they saw God, &gt;&gt; the Bible says they all died in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Read it. Read it in your Bible. Read it. And Jesus, he healed and took the fever away and raised the dead. And they came by the thousands and tore off their clothes and wave laid them down and waved, "Hosana in the highest. Hosana." One week before they were crying, crucify, crucify, crucify. What happens? People are fickle &gt;&gt; if they don't have a real revelation. Really fickle. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are they not? Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; That's why I say when a person has a birth and gets their eyes fixed on the supernatural, on the invisible, on the intangible, they're unmovable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're unmovable. &gt;&gt; And here comes brother Brandham. 30 years, not three and a half as Jesus 30 years in front of the people, in front of mostly the Pentecostal people. As brother Brandham said, you received me and you receive the supernatural. They were made for it and the great signs and wonders that were done and they are to attend the church. It's not that they're not supposed to. They're they are too attentive. But that's what their focus was. What they could see, what they could feel, what could happen. And they wanted they wanted to see these things take place. And oh, they were did they glorify God? They glorified God. And then God begins to send his word. Come and see. &gt;&gt; God now begins to define himself in a thus sayith the Lord in a word. And the people now for the first time begin to see who it was that was with the prophet. And when they saw who it was, &gt;&gt; they went their way. &gt;&gt; They went to their business. They went back to their cattle. They went back to the full gospel businessmen. They went back to their churches. They went back and look where they are today. &gt;&gt; And you never saw that. You never were in those meetings. You have tapes, but you didn't see maybe what I saw. That's why I feel it's a double blessing for me to be able to be here. I saw it and I'm still here. &gt;&gt; You never saw it and you're here. &gt;&gt; He in his grace, oh, made himself known to you. He in his grace showed himself to you and here you are. &gt;&gt; And I say to you in the name of the Lord, &gt;&gt; let your vision pierce the veil. &gt;&gt; Let your vision look to the unseen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just can't I can't really go on any further. I have so much so much here I would like to say, but I would I'd like to tell you that this messenger that is the one thing I'm so endeared to and he said that same God, that same God that was back there is actually present with you now. Oh, if I could get you to believe that. &gt;&gt; If I could get you to believe that, there wouldn't be a sick person in this place. &gt;&gt; Not that that's our focus, but we desire those things. We desire the supernatural. Satan has no right &gt;&gt; to God's children. &gt;&gt; You're sick here and afflicted. It's your right to be free from that. You've not had this experience with God. It's your right. &gt;&gt; It's your right to have it. &gt;&gt; You're here and you have not had a real light turning on of revelation within you. I'm not here to try to preach you into it. I'm just here to tell you it's your right. &gt;&gt; Now, I come against Satan in the name of Jesus Christ. Something has plagued you. Some blindness has blinded you. It's your right to have vision. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. It's your right to look into the invisible. &gt;&gt; It's your right to have faith. &gt;&gt; Faith belongs to you. It's your right more so than your feeling of your hand. It's your right to have that kind of touch. [Applause] And the prophet said, if we don't walk in light, if we only walk in, he said, if we don't walk in light, we'll become children of darkness. &gt;&gt; God, let us walk in light. &gt;&gt; The light of the word that has come. &gt;&gt; I give all praise and glory to God who has brought this message. I shall not be ashamed of this word. &gt;&gt; It has brought you to where you are today. I say glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; For having called you and brought you into his light. &gt;&gt; You didn't only come, but now you see. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All glory to God. I've seen God face to face &gt;&gt; and my life is preserved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My life is preserved. &gt;&gt; What was preserved? What was preserved when Jacob met him? What was preserved was the fact, listen closely, that he became within the lineage of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Satan was trying to rob him of the privilege. Listen to me friends. This world, this world would try to entice you for the single purpose of consuming you. &gt;&gt; This world would try to entice you with the good things of this age and the beautiful things of this age. You try to entice you until you be completely consumed and that is your whole focus and that that just becomes your energy is spent on that. And at the same time, God from another realm is speaking to us and showing us what it is he given. Here it is. And he's laying it out for us. He's giving it as simply as he can. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I have an ambition in life. And I'll tell you, I can tell you my ambition. My life is close to being I'm in the twilight years. You may wonder why I am I am obsessed with getting the message into somebody else's hands. I feel a great coolness even amongst believers on that subject because they're content. I have it. And this is what I I'm in the bride. There's only God's grace here in the bride. &gt;&gt; Nothing good that you have done. And by bringing you in, God laid the responsibility on you to try and give it to somebody else. &gt;&gt; Show it to somebody else. Manifest this Christ to somebody else. Manifest this revelation to somebody else. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm obsessed. I sit at home as I did this week and I run across and I'm reading the message looking to the unsane. Looking at the unseen and I'm just so moved. I said, "My wife, let me read this to you. Isn't that beautiful? Isn't that beautiful?" And right away I get stung. What if somebody else wants to read that? What if somebody else that hasn't got that &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; needs that? &gt;&gt; What can you do? And I feel that's where we need to use our energies and our resources. &gt;&gt; Will I ever see that person? Maybe never see that person. Maybe never shake hands with that person. But I look to the unseen. One day, one day I tell you, I'm going to take a I'm going to take a journey, too. One day I'm going to take a step into my theophony. One day I'm going to be more than theophony. I'm going to be in a glorified body. You'll be in a glorified body. And let that body be more real than the one you're sitting in today. &gt;&gt; That's the promise of God's word. If I try to think of it with my mind, it's too too impossible. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; It just seems so far out of reach. The only way I can do it is with what he said. Right. &gt;&gt; And by getting it into someone else's language, I just think right away someone else can read that and see those same words and have that same effect on them. I see where that word has helped me through big battles, through big struggles. &gt;&gt; See where Satan tries to come in and just tear everything out from under you. I'll share one more very very precious moment with you. I may have shared it with this congregation. I don't know. Back in the log church, we were going through one of our darkest moments. It seemed that all the powers of darkness and Satan came against us. Came against me personally as well. And just as you walked in through the double doors, there was a door right here where the where the tapes had been cleaned. It was a nursery first and then we made it a room where the tapes were being filtered, brother Bren. And what was that for? Try to get it so someone else could hear it. Try to just get some get some tapes out. Get some cassettes out. Do whatever you could do. And I went into that room and I fell to my knees and I sobbed. You say you you sobbed, Brother Ed? Yeah, I did. I sobbed like my whole inside had broken like a fountain. And I cried out to God. And God spoke to my heart. No voice, nothing audible, but as clear as I'm speaking to you. Says, "Like David, I have given you peace. and you have walked with my prophet. Those two things. I've had ministers come and say, "Brother Ed, we look at your church and we see its stability." I move very quickly to back away &gt;&gt; from taking any credit. Zero. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; There's no talent, no smarts, no nothing. Not my ministry, nothing. I go immediately back to that chair. I've given you peace. And I face those times. Every time I face them, not too often, but every time I do. Why am I saying this to you? You maybe didn't kneel at that chair, but you've knelt someplace. God spoke to you someplace. God talked to you somewhere. And I'm encouraging you, you go back as Jacob did, saying to his grown son, who's now a great great ruler, saying, "Put your hand at this spot where I met God, where I wrestled it out with God." That's what I say to you. And whenever I face it, I go back to that moment. And that's I read for you this morning, Jacob. Here he's coming. got his brother and a host of men, armies of men, 400 of them. He doesn't know what's going to happen, but he begins to tell God, "God, this is what you said." What's he doing? He's looking to the invisible. He's not looking at all the things that are around him. And I'm saying to the congregation this morning, we've got a we've got a a a a major battle on in Leodysia. This is a day of sights and sounds and feelings, feeling good, medications, everything, uppers and downers and this and that. Don't be hurt. Don't feel bad. Are you depressed? We got things to look after you. We got things to fix you. That's this world. We got a new color. We got a new taste. We got a new design. There's a new pickup truck coming out. There's a new this. There's a new that. I say don't have your eyes on that. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; And let your faith and your philosophy be. Whatever he chooses for me &gt;&gt; will be fine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you for your patience. Thank you for your time. Thank you for listening to me. And I pray that it'll be a blessing to you in the name of Jesus Christ. I trust you'll come to know him. Not lifting myself up, but I trust you'll come to know him as I have known him. When I speak to you and I become touched, it's because I've met him. I've heard him. I've heard his voice. I tell you, children, it works. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it works. Do you remember where he met you? Do you remember where he first spoke to you? Don't forget about going back to it, reminding him. That's when you delivered me. &gt;&gt; That's when you set me free. That's when you spoke to my heart. That's when you told me to do a certain thing and I did it. Amen. I've seen God face to face and my life is preserved. &gt;&gt; Let's just pray. How we love you, Lord. How we love you, oh God. You're the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob. You are the one that they worshiped. Father, today as I've spoken very openly and very personally to this congregation, I pray, Father, especially for those that have not come to know you yet. May it be even now. May there be a strange and wonderful movement of around them. May they sense your presence, Lord. And for others that may not sense anything, may they simply say, "You have spoken it, oh God. You have said it in your word, and I want to follow it. I give myself to you." Lord, there's no service that we should end without giving opportunity to the people to say, "I am yours, Lord. I give myself to you." Right in the middle of my prayer, if that's you, then lift your hand. Let our eyes be closed and our hearts be in prayer. You lift your hand. Say, "Oh God, make yourself I need you to make yourself real to me." And I'm calling out to you right now. Don't depend on my prayer, but depend on your prayer. Depend on the promise of God. And heavenly father I pray through Jesus Christ the they the our redemption our redeemer. Lord even as you uh use Jacob in his own way and in his part you advanced you advanced and move forward the uh the coming of Christ uh in in in his visitation. And now in this time, Lord, you've even spoke through your messenger that we bring forth, we actually produce and bring forth the body of Jesus Christ in a bride form. Lord, I pray that you will take the word and the not only the sincerity but the seriousness of it. And may may our vision Lord in the name of Jesus Christ let the vision of this congregation be fixed on the invisible Lord and on that which is beyond this world. For you've said in this you've said that the things of this world will pass away but those things oh God which you have made eternal they will be forever. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I ask these blessings and believe for them. Lord, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to have you stand and sing with me, Faith of Our Fathers, Living Still. I've got half a scripture I'll read. For we walk by faith, not by &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That was written for us. &gt;&gt; We walk by faith. &gt;&gt; We walk by what we don't see. &gt;&gt; And not by sight. &gt;&gt; That's what Apostle Paul has said. All right, let's sing this song together. Faith of our father living still in fire and fire and sword. Oh, our hearts be high with joy. Where we hear that glorious word, fade of our father, [Applause] we will be true to the day. Our father's chain in prison dark where still and heart and conscious brea how sweet would be their children's faith if they like them could die for thee. Faith of our father. Holy faith. We will be true to thee till death. Faith of our father. We will love both friend and fool in all our strife and preaching as love knows how by kindly words and users. Holy faith we will be true to as your testimony faith on our father's holy name we will be true to the children. Why do you think Hebrews 11 is there in the scripture? It's there for you. It's there for me. By faith, Abraham, by faith, Sarah, by faith, Noah, by faith the patriarchs, by faith. That's what God recognized. And friends, it's not something you have to pull down. Faith is nigh thee. &gt;&gt; Where? Even in thy mouth. &gt;&gt; The word of faith which we preach, it's not far away. this thing that I preach today, it's not don't become quiet. It's not something that's distant. It's I'm trying to tell you you possess it. You have it. You need to just exercise that. Hallelujah. And part of the exercising will be will be turning your focus from this &gt;&gt; to this. &gt;&gt; And I want to say in closing, you can have both. That's why I use Jacob, please. I'm not preaching anymore, but I use Jacob as a testimony because a believer can have both the material &gt;&gt; and his vision fixed on the unseen at the same time. &gt;&gt; And that is why &gt;&gt; the scripture tells us of kings. &gt;&gt; David, he he he didn't write in his Psalms 10 and some books and chapters. He didn't write about his throne. He didn't write about the marble. He didn't write about the great columns and the great pillars and what more he wanted to do. He wrote about the covenant of God and wrote about the precepts and your word is life to me. That was all. What is it? He had he was connected to the intangible. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I pray that my time here this morning will not be in vain, but that there'll be a majority majority of this congregation that will say, "I'm fixing I'm fixing my vision from this to this." There was a whole portion of the Old Testament where exactly the same principle applies. Exactly the same principle applies. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got a life to live. You got bills to pay. I would I would advise you to take exactly what the old preacher said. God, you and I are in a deep dark hole. You get out, I'll hang on, and we'll both be out. Think that's good. That's good advice. That's good advice. And as sure as we're standing here, friends, you are going to cross over. &gt;&gt; I'm looking at you. You are going to cross over. &gt;&gt; I am going to cross over. We might as well meet victoriously. &gt;&gt; We might as well go victoriously. &gt;&gt; We might as well go with our sights on the right goal. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? [Music] We're going to be there more real than we are right now. &gt;&gt; More real than we are right now. We are going to cross over and it won't be too long. And we're going to be on the other side either through the rapture or through and listen one last thing. When the opening of this word was coming and the opening of the seals was coming, the voice that spoke to him said, "This will bring rapturing faith." &gt;&gt; Tell you what, I want to look on that, brother Gary. &gt;&gt; I want to be looking on that. I want to be looking on that, Nathan. Brothers and sisters, I want to keep my eyes on that. God bless you. We're going to pray now. Dear Father, I'm just asking as we close, as we dismiss, let this be a day when we ponder and think deeply about our lives, about what you'd have us to do, that we might follow very seriously, conscientiously. And Lord, in a consecrated way, the voice of the Holy Spirit, I pray that you'll direct the footsteps of these precious people. These are your children. You bought them with your own blood. I pray that oh God let them let us as a group of people be a true testimony be a true expression of the Lord Jesus Christ as he's revealed in this hour in Jesus Christ's name. Dismiss us now with your grace I pray for your glory. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. You greet one another on this side. [Music] Lord willing, we'll see you on Wednesday evening. God bless you. [Music] What are you doing? [Music] Daddy. Hey, [Music] are you [Music] Maybe. [Music] Holy [Music] Ghost. [Music] Hallelujah.
