[1:19] we lived in Victoria and I got a call
[1:24] from my brother saying that my dad had
[1:29] had a massive heart attack the main
[1:33] artery to his heart had ruptured out and
[1:37] he was just hanging on a thread and in
[1:42] those days they had oxygen tents were
[1:45] they put them over you so my husband
[1:48] called the doctor in Dawson Creek and
[1:51] the doctor said you'd better send her up
[1:54] so it was about a two-hour flight I
[1:58] guess up to Dawson so I went up and I
[2:02] was only able to stand by his bed for 10
[2:04] minutes and and a day and not not speak
[2:10] to him he couldn't speak of course and I
[2:13] was there for two or three days and then
[2:15] I had to come back because we were now
[2:17] preparing for brother branham's meetings
[2:20] I was very burdened for him my heart was
[2:25] very happy and we went into the Alberni
[2:29] meetings with that on my heart wanting
[2:33] to speak to brother Brown him and ask
[2:35] him to pray for him but I didn't have a
[2:38] chance because I was playing the piano
[2:40] and then we came down to Victoria and
[2:44] had the meetings there and the meetings
[2:48] closed and brother Ed was speaking to
[2:52] brother Branham and just saying goodbye
[2:54] to him and we stood outside the motel
[2:56] and it was evening late evening and they
[3:01] were just saying goodbye in a very
[3:03] casual way and then he just turned and
[3:05] said oh by the way sister Pisco your
[3:09] father will be all right and from then
[3:13] on he recovered and I think he was about
[3:19] 64 when he had that attack and from then
[3:25] on he had no trouble with his heart not
[3:30] one man
[3:31] and he lived just a month from 85 and he
[3:36] passed away just from old age no trouble
[3:40] with his heart whatsoever and when
[3:44] brother Branham said he'll be alright
[3:46] he was alright and he said he confessed
[3:50] he said I know I'm saved in Alberni I
[3:55] was in the meetings there
[3:57] when brother Brown was there and hearing
[4:00] him call out the native Indian people
[4:04] that I knew and I knew their situations
[4:07] I don't know if he told about this one
[4:10] brother his name was Mike and he was
[4:14] sitting right up probably the second row
[4:17] from the front and everybody knew about
[4:21] an older man who was from a little
[4:25] fishing village called a howzit he had
[4:29] been an invalid just laying on a cot for
[4:32] years and and brother branham said to
[4:37] this brother Mike you're praying for
[4:41] this man and he's an invalid and he's in
[4:46] a hospital not far from here in a city
[4:50] called Nanaimo well brother ad knew that
[4:57] this brother was from a howzit so in his
[5:01] mind he said no this brother is not in
[5:04] Nanaimo he's in a howzit and another
[5:08] brother on the platform said no this
[5:12] brother is not in Nanaimo he's in
[5:16] Alberni in a hospital and afterwards
[5:20] they found out yes he had been moved
[5:23] that very day up to the Indian hospital
[5:27] in Nanaimo and brother Branham had said
[5:31] he's in denial brother Robert Johnson
[5:38] took brother branham out in his boat
[5:41] this is in the Alberni area and it was
[5:45] out on the Alberni canal and brother
[5:50] Johnson and his wife were unable to have
[5:53] children and they had prayed about
[5:55] having a child and as they were going
[6:00] along in the boat suddenly they thought
[6:05] they had hit a log what they call a dead
[6:09] head it's a floating log just below the
[6:12] surface
[6:13] very dangerous to two boats if they hit
[6:17] that and and brother branham said to
[6:22] brother Johnson you thought you'd you
[6:25] thought you hit a dead head that was the
[6:29] presence of the Lord
[6:30] letting you know that he's going to give
[6:33] you and your wife a child we lived with
[6:37] the native people included we stayed in
[6:41] their house I wouldn't even want to tell
[6:45] you the conditions of things that we saw
[6:48] but you know that's the way it is you
