Brother Joe Waldner, would you come this morning, Brother Joe, take us before the throne of grace as a congregation. My heart's very full this morning. I trust that yours is, too. We do want to remember Sister Leverne. She's not sitting here this morning. She's at home not feeling well. When I first read the request, it says, "I would like to request prayer." And I thought it said, "I would like to request power." And I thought after I reread it, I said, "Well, I like the first version first." She needs power. She needs that wonder working power. Amen. To come down and energize her body. We also want to remember Brother Ryan Hayes this morning. Faithful musician and song leader in our congregation. A wonderful gift that God has placed in our body. We want to remember him this morning as well. Brother Joe, bow our heads and our hearts this morning. Precious heavenly father, dear Lord Jesus, come before thy holy presence this morning. We're so thankful for your goodness, grace, and love and mercy towards us, Father. Because you are our father, we come before thee, Father, with encouraged hearts, oh God, knowing we're your children. If children, we're heirs of these great, exceedingly precious promises that you've laid before us in thy word, oh God. So we come boldly, Lord God, knowing that you're still the same yesterday, today, and forever. You say, "I'm the Lord God and I change not." Lord, you are today what you've always been, Father. Oh God, we can come with the token on our lives applied, Father, that we know, Lord God, Father, that we have now the earnest of our inheritance, Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, knowing that you're still the same yesterday, today, and forever. And you have given us the Holy Spirit, oh God, that we can rejoice, that can lead and guide us, Father. And that we can ask anything in thy name, Lord. You said you will do it, Father. Oh God. So Lord, this morning also, we just want to lift up thy wonderful name, which name is above every name. A name that's far above every principality and every power. You are ruler, Lord. You rule this world, Father. Oh God, and everything is your hands. You set up kingdoms and you make kingdoms to follow God because you are God and beside you there is no other Lord God. So we lift you up this morning and we want the word to lift you up father. We want our minister to come and exalt you, Father. Oh God, and to learn of thee once again, Father, encourage our hearts, encourage our life, Father. Oh God, we lift you up this morning, oh God. Lord, and we want to lift up those that are sick and afflicted today, oh Father. We just lift up, oh God, our sister and our brother, oh God. They have they have they have brought in this request, oh God. Father, and surely, Lord God, you know the need, oh God, this morning, oh God. I also want to lift up our brother Jerry Schul, oh God, who's in the hospital, sick and afflicted. Oh God, down in Louisiana, Lord. Lord, a brother, oh God, that's been faithful. He's been addicted for many years, Father. He stood before thee, oh God. Lord, he has his lungs are so bad, Lord, having to be on oxygen most of the time, Father. Lord, my desire, oh God, is that you give him a new set of lungs, oh God. Lord, not just to be just healed for a moment, oh God. We lift them up, oh God. We also want to lift up the children that surround him. His wife, Father, the ministering brethren that brother-in-laws, Father, that are burdening their hearts for them, oh God, in the church and brothers Tim and Timothy, oh God. We just want to lift them up, oh God, at this time being discouraged, oh God. And I'm sure, Lord, they need prayer this morning, Father. Lord, and for our congregation here as a whole, oh God, we want to lift every soul up in your divine presence, oh God. Oh Lord, you know every need, oh God. Father, oh Lord, and we we have need. We we ask thee, oh God, that you'll meet every need. Lord, anoint your word as it come this morning in power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost. Oh God, Father, we need you in this hour to come in power and in strength. Oh God, bless thy people once again. Oh God, we give you thanks and honor and glory. Heavenly Father, bless this day to us. We commit it to you and your wonderful name, Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord. Why don't you have your seats this morning as the deacons receive the offering? Amen. Thank you. Why don't we sing together uh number 483 on the screen if you could? I shall not be I shall not be moved. Before Before you start playing, I've got uh two quick announcements that I need to make. So, young people's will be this Friday at 7:30 p.m. and that's 13 and up. So, if you're in the young people's bracket between 13 and up, make sure that you're there. That's from Brother Mike Andes. If you have any questions, please connect with Brother Mike. And today between the services at 3:00, the Sunday school will be practicing and they would like all of the Sunday school helpers that are involved in that from the young people's group if you could be there at 3:00 as well. I believe I'm not going to guess where that's at, but I'm going to say I'm going to say in the chapel, but if it's not, head over to the fellowship room. I know the fellowship room can be kind of full during the services, so make sure that you're there. Let me see if I have anything else here. All right, let's sing. Uh, I shall not be moved. As the deacons are receiving the offering, Jesus is my savior. I shall not be moved [Music] there. I shall not be moved. Just like a tree that's planted by the waterers. I shall not be moved. I shall not be I shall not be I shall not be moved. I shall not be I shall not be moved. Just like a tree that planted by the waterers. I shall not be moved in my Christ in my Christ. I shall not be moved. She is love. I'm hiding. I shall not be moved. Just like that's planted by the water. I shall not be. Oh, I shall not be I shall not be moved. I shall not be I shall not be moved. That's planted by the waterers. Lord, I shall not be moved. Amen. That's a good testimony. &gt;&gt; Well, this morning I have a couple announcements I'd like to make. Seeing that we're coming into the season that we are, they call it Christmas season. Um, number one, I'd like to um, uh, let you know that there will be a schedule posted up in the foyer in around the office to let you know the service times. I'll go over that. But uh this morning we'd like to recognize a couple of brothers that um that uh we'd like to put forward as um as deacons or they would like to step into a position or they wouldn't mind step into a position. But the brethren have a need for more brothers. Uh seeing that the congregation is growing, the needs are many and uh the names have been put forward. We want to put them forward to you. They'll be going through what we call a trial period over a couple next three months. See how they work in and how you work in with them. And uh I'd like brother uh Jeff Wman if he would mind standing so everybody would know. Brother Jeff Wman and brother Leon Garland. Would you like to stand up? Brother Leon, these are the two brothers that the brethren have names have been put forward. So if you see them helping the deacons over the next few weeks and months, they're there for a reason. And we thank God that God have put uh faithful and loyal brothers amongst us. And may God use them and may you be comfortable in the position that God has now placed you in. They are faithful brethren and of a good report. So God bless you and thank you for standing. Amen. Next is a Christmas schedule we'll be going into um coming into the Christmas time on December the 25th. It is Christmas morning and the greatest gift that we could have is to come and and worship the giver himself, the giver of the great gift. So, we'll have one service that morning at 11:00 on December the 25th. Uh that following Wednesday will be a regular service. Praise the Lord. And look forward to that. Then on December the 31st at 9:00, uh that is our watch night service. It will start sharply at 9. And of course, the next morning is New Year's, January the 1st. So, we thought we'd start an early service around 7 in the morning. I knew that would keep you awake. I just wondering whether you were listening. No, we will have a 1:00 in the afternoon service so that all of you people that need to sleep in and get your rest can get some rest. So, again, December the 25th, one service at 11:00, regular service the following Wednesday. Our watch night service December the 31st at 9:00 and our January the 1st service will be 1 in the afternoon. God bless you. Looking forward to the word. Pastors preaching this morning. &gt;&gt; I'm under great expectation. Amen. May we just pull on the gift. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Let's just sing a couple more verses of that song we were singing. Um we've got a special this morning and a baby dedication. So, those that are singing, the Vanenter children, if they would come up and get ready, we'll just sing this another time or two while they're getting ready, and then we'll move right into the dedication at the end of their song. I shall not be I shall not be moved. I shall not be I shall not be moved. Just like a tree that's planted by the water. I shall not be moved. It's on his word I'm leading. I shall not be moved. He's leading. I shall not be moved. Just like a tree that's planted by the waterers. I shall not be moved. I shall not be I shall not be I shall not be moved. I shall not be I shall not be just like a sea that's planted by the water. I shall not be. Glory hallelujah. Oh, glory halleluah. I shall not be moved. I'm anchored in Jehovah. I shall not be moved. Just like a tree that's planted by the waterers. I shall not. Oh, sing it out now. Will I shall not be? I shall not be moved. I shall not be I shall not be moved. Just like that by the water. I shall not be moved. I shall not be. I shall not be. I shall not be moved. I shall not be. I shall not move just like that's planted by the waterers. I shall not be [Music] I read about how Paul and Silas were in jail and no one there. Nobody there to pay their bill. But when they prayed, &gt;&gt; But when they prayed, they found that God was on their side. The jailhouse door, &gt;&gt; the jailhouse door swung open wide. If you believe, &gt;&gt; if you believe, you shall receive. You shall receive. There's not a trouble or the Lord can't relieve. Oh, he is just the same today. All you have to do is trust and pray and believe. You must believe when Daniel said within the hungry lion's den, nobody thought nobody thought that there was any hope for him. But all night long the lions never took a bite. God took away. God took away their time. If you believe, if you believe, you shall receive. You shall receive. There's not a trouble or can the good Lord can't believe. Oh, he is just the same today. All you have to do is just pray. You must believe. When David stood when David stood before the giant with his ling alive as such a puny little thing. But David knew what David knew. His faith in God would stand the test. He slung the rock. He slung the roof. God did the rest. If you believe in you shall receive. You shall receive. There's not a trouble ahead. The good Lord can't believe. Oh, he is just the same today. All you have to do is trust and pray. Believe. You must believe. All you have to do is trust and pray and believe. You must believe. All you had to do is trust and pray and believe. You must believe. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Wow, that was some singing, wasn't it? We're going to have a baby dedication and uh we parents arranged for them to sing just in front of the baby dedication. So uh wow. &gt;&gt; I hope that this daughter that we're going to dedicate will know what kind of singing we're expecting of her. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that all right? &gt;&gt; And you know they weren't just singing a special. I think that was an example to all of us. &gt;&gt; You sing like that. We'll all have the same response. &gt;&gt; I looked over the congregation and they were everybody was smiling. &gt;&gt; Isn't that nice? &gt;&gt; Joy. I thought you should be up here singing too, but maybe there'll be another time. All right. Well, this is the family that the medical world said couldn't happen. That's what they said. How many years was that? &gt;&gt; Five years. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Five years. &gt;&gt; Five years. &gt;&gt; Five years. Five years can't happen. And never will have a natural birth. And this fourth one came with by natural birth. Everything was natural. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh Andre has said to me in the email which and and in person that she is an absolute miracle. So I feel somewhat honored today to not just merely be here but to dedicate a miracle to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God sent a miracle down. Now we dedicate a miracle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, brother Rickart and sister Andrea have desired to dedicate this baby. This child is a daughter and they have named her Adele Lorraine. Adele because of the meaning of being noble, kind and tender. And uh they said we thought it appropriate to have tender as a meaning because in this world not too many people are tender towards the Lord and that would be a great attribute for her to have. And I thought it would be a great time in this service for everyone to say, "Lord, let me be tender &gt;&gt; towards your Holy Spirit. Let me be tender to the words that you have chosen to be spoken today. May I be tender to the word of God." And I'm going to just say a word more about that in a moment. And the second name they named her Lorraine, named after her greatg grandmother Ruth and after her mother Andrea. They both carry that same name Lorraine. And in case you don't know, it's a place in France and it's connected to nobility. They good thing for ancestry.com. they can find out it goes all the way back to Charlemagne. We're all We're all kings and priests somehow. But I love the word tender because it made reference to my I think one of my favorite of kings of the Old Testament, which was a young lad, Josiah. And for you boys that are seated here, it might surprise you that he came to the throne at 8 years old. 8 years old. And sometime between 8 and 18, he some of his people were digging and found a holy book, the book of the law. and and in the book they had read of the judgments of God that came against the people because they had not adhered to the word. And uh he just was in anguish over that. And the Bible says this, he sent he sent messengers to uh to uh Halda. He sent messengers to Hilkaya the high priest. And God spoke to him through them and said this because thine heart was tender. That's always been special for me. Because his heart was tender. And he was just a young lad, a young man. Because your heart was tender and thou hast humbled thyself before the Lord. When thou heardest what I spake against this place, it wasn't a compliment. It was something against the place and his heart was tender and against the inhabitants thereof. And they should become a desolation and a curse. Now what he did, he rent his clo his clothes and wept before God. And God heard him. Now friends, I just want to say to you, this is a big dedication, but this is more than a big this is a service and God has a purpose in this &gt;&gt; and that is that we when we hear something even if it's against us, we we come before God with a soft tender heart and he tore his clothes in in humility and came to God with such desperate and wept before God. God said, "Send words back to this young man." And I pray that that will be the case with Adele. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and all that she may affect in life. So, we're going to dedicate Adele Lorraine Vanenter to the Lord. Do I dare hold her? I'm like, &gt;&gt; she w we thought she was going to be quiet, but she wants to say amen. We'll pray. Heavenly Father, we hold this jewel that you have sent down into the Vanenter home. &gt;&gt; And you ordained that Andrea should be her mother &gt;&gt; and brother Rickart shall be her father. And we pray, oh God, that you will watch over her. &gt;&gt; I pray that there will be a holy cloud of the Holy Spirit upon her &gt;&gt; and that she will indeed be a noble child. &gt;&gt; Indeed, she shall be one, oh God, that will be tender to your Holy Spirit. And as you have given her through a miraculous birth and conception to this couple, Lord Jesus, our brother Rickart and Sister Andrea, now we dedicate them as as not only as husband and wife, but as father and mother. And I pray that this child, Lord, will grow up with the glory of God upon her face. I pray, Lord, that you will let her hear your name and understand it. &gt;&gt; Then she may understand your word, Lord. Pray that you'll give her that gift and we dedicate this child back to you father in the name of Jesus Christ. Adele Lorraine van enter given back to you on this day in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; That was a glory hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. God bless you. Thanks for the song. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I want to put up a a slide also of our brother Kobas's work and what we've done. We've adjusted a wee bit, brother Kobus, just to show what had been taking place in the last week. So, can we put that slide up and then we'll we'll need to dim the lights. So, this is since last week uh the previous week the top one of Chinese was at 16% and now at 30% 14% change. The next one was from 0% to 2%. The IG pool uh proof reading is uh this week is 100%. Last week was 82. Now it's 100% and that's already set to go up. The lingala was from 22% up to 27%. This is just this week friends what people have been giving. and uh a German proof reading which was 1% that remains unchanged this week. Shona proof reading from zero went up to 6% in one week and the shona the bottom Shona was 100% and it is 100% yet today. So it hasn't changed. It's 100% last week, 100% this week. Amen. Brother Kobus, uh, you haven't been that visible with the people, but I will speak about a certain part of the body of Christ. And to those of you that have not been forward or visible, you won't forget this service. you mothers and sisters, women uh that you hear a lot of things in the message that you perhaps have felt touched you in a derogatory way and there are others who never are forward, never are seen, do not play an instrument, do not sing. Uh, I want to talk about you today and so you will remember this service. I'll have you stand and read with me and you can turn in your Bibles to Ephesians the 5th chapter. And just before we read, I'd like to pray with you. Have you pray with me? And while you bow your head and while you ponder what to say, say this. Father, open my eyes as you did Josiah's and let me hear your voice. Let me hear what you want me to hear. May it touch my heart. Heavenly Father, this is what I pray. This is what I desire for every one of these your elected that are gathered here in this place. And there are so many others around the globe. Those that you died for, those that were on your mind when you did the act of redemption. Lord Jesus, we are here to thank you for giving yourself freely and heavenly father expressing what was in your thoughts before the foundation of the world. You would not allow the enemy of our souls to have any victory. You conquered him. You smoked him. You left him helpless on the ground and cast him to the dust of the earth. And Lord, we believe and we live in the joy of that victory. We are here today, oh God, to declare you have indeed sent your Holy Spirit which came forth from your body. And I pray that today, Lord, you will make this so clear and so evident to the people. And may the people of the Lord rejoice in knowing that you are mindful of every member in Jesus Christ's name. Now I pray you will touch us each one speaker and hearers alike and those that are streaming and wherever they may be may be may those that are afflicted rise up in the name of the almighty one the conqueror of all sickness and all frailties and all death in the name of Jesus Christ. Thy say thy will be done and all the glory shall go to you Lord Jesus. Amen and amen. Hallelujah to our God. Glory to our God. Thank you for your word, Lord. Thank you for the message that you sent. Thank you for the prophet messenger that you sent, oh God. Faithful to our word, and we have received it. We have received it. We believe on him who sent him. We believe on you, Lord Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now in Ephesians 5 and30 I'm going to read one verse and then I would like to read two quotes and then you may have your seats after that. Ephesians 5 and30. We'll be reading other scriptures later. For we are members of his body. Who's members of his body? We are. &gt;&gt; We are. Whoever can include themselves. And we we are members. I don't care where you're seated this morning or where people are that are streaming the service. We are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. And I'm going to be stressing the bones. Because when we see one another, you don't see bones. You see the physical part. You see the flesh part. So we say flesh of his flesh. But that doesn't they don't stop there. And the Bible doesn't stop there. And brother Brandham doesn't stop there. He says, "And bones of his bones." &gt;&gt; That's the revelation Adam had when Eve was taken from him from a rib. Not from a muscle, not from a ligament, but from a rib, a bone. Took that the invisible part and made it visible. &gt;&gt; And here we are for a season. You're visible. We see you. Uh I'm sure you're happy that you're not sitting beside a skeleton. But on the other hand, if it wasn't for the skeleton, you wouldn't be standing. So that's the invisible part. And we're very happy that we have the invisible part. I was thinking of you, Brother David, and happy to have &gt;&gt; Brother David here this morning. He can tell you about some of the bones when they become broken. It becomes very painful. And I can tell you that you might be an invisible part of the body of Christ. But if you get fractured or broken, &gt;&gt; we have a lot of pain. &gt;&gt; And the pain radiates through the rest of the body. And I want you to know that that's not poetic language and that's not in the dream world. That's in the real world. &gt;&gt; And God's provided place of worship. Brother Brandham has said, "Now remember in Christ we are flesh of his flesh, bone of his bones. When God wounded Christ at Calvary, he was wounded for me and you. We are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone, body of his body, name of his name, bride of him. See, we are in him. We are his flesh and his bones. And God has already raised us up potentially. The quickening power that raised us up raised us rather from the uh from a life of sin and changed our being. It has potentially raised us up in Christ Jesus which the resurrection will bring us forth in the full maturity. &gt;&gt; That's what the resurrection will be. But you have been raised up. Flesh of his flesh, you that are more visible and bone of his bone. You that are not that visible, &gt;&gt; but not less important. &gt;&gt; In fact, is very much the other way. And in the seed shall not be heir with the shock. I read this. Jesus is the word and he is the bridegroom and the bride is part of the groom. Therefore, the word that is to be fulfilled this day is the same part of the word that was fulfilled in his day. And it's the same word, same experience, same life. For when God separated Adam, he was both uh he was both. We find out Adam was spirit to begin with and incidentally that's invisible. the invisible world. He made man of his own image, created he he him male and female and the male became visible and the female remained invisible until he took a bone from Adam and then Genesis 2 and and on he created man out of the dust of the earth. Now he became visible. Man was created in God's image. God is a spirit. So he's a spirit man. Then when he became flesh man, animal flesh on the earth. He is showing portraying here the bride. He never the bride he never taken and made another being but he took part of Adam the original creation and took from him a rib. You came from an original creation of Jesus Christ. He took from him a rib from his side and took the feminine spirit of Adam and left the masculine spirit in there and placed it in the feminist part. Therefore, part of his spirit, part of his body, flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone, word of his word, life of his life. And that's the way the bride is to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can the congregation agree with that? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated and keep your Bibles ready if you would please. I want you to think about the flesh as being the visible part and the bone as being the invisible part. Those are both parts. I have just so we could get as as good a understanding as possible. I've taken I had brother John uh photocopy for me so we could get a little better understanding. But instead instead, excuse me, there is absolute necessity for the parts of the body that are considered the more weak And those parts of the body which we consider rather ignoble are the very parts which we invest with additional honor and our unseemly parts and those uh unsuitable for exposure are treated not not unsuitable for exposure because of appearance But their office or their position may be that they are not called of God to be visible. He says they are treated with seemingless modesty and uh something less than uh they use the word decorum which are more presentable parts do not require but God has so adjusted he's mingled harmonized those parts and subtly proportioned the parts of the whole body, giving the greater honor and richer endowment to the inferior parts which lack apparent importance. Now you're you're going to this is going to kind of set the mind in a different channel and needs to be because sometimes we've had a lot of emphasis and no emphasis at all or not even maybe mention of those that are not visible and do not have any recognized honor. But I'd like you to know that when there are just so many scriptures, so many scriptures. God took Ezekiel to a valley of dry &gt;&gt; what? What? Fleshones. &gt;&gt; Bones. He says, "Can these live?" &gt;&gt; It looked hopeless. &gt;&gt; And Ezekiel said, "Thou knowest. And the Bible says that he caused them to stand. &gt;&gt; Not a heap of flesh, but he caused the bones to stand. He put senu on them and flesh on them and skin on them. And it was a being. And then God breathed into it. &gt;&gt; Became a living person. When Jesus was resurrected from the dead, it was the women that came and rushed and came early to the tomb and and the and seeing two men in uh white garments. They said, "See where he lay. This is where he was laying." And when they stepped outside, they found that he was standing there and they held him by the feet. He wasn't standing without bones. He required the body of Christ required flesh and bones and that was exactly the way it was. We'll be going now. I get your mind in a certain direction and I want to major on that. I've been pondering this and actually studying it for probably two weeks or more and spending a lot of time on it. I want to read some scriptures because I would like to give a little uh background to some of these things. I'm I'm just you don't have to follow with me uh in your Bible. I will just read these scriptures. Acts 1 and3 to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them. I wanted to have these on the screen but I'll make the emphasis to whom to whom this was a certain segment of people a certain group of people. If you want to include yourself, God bless you. If you don't want to include yourself, I can't say God bless you. But I I will say you should be able to include yourself to whom he showed himself. That should cause this congregation to say, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; let that resurrected Christ be seen of me. &gt;&gt; Let that resurrected Christ speak and give me ears to hear him." &gt;&gt; And to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs. And that continued on into the prophet's ministry. And that has continued on since the prophet's ministry because it's the same resurrected Christ. And he cannot do anything but the supernatural things. He has done many, many supernatural things. And some of his most wonderful things cannot even be mentioned over the pulpit for one reason or another. But there are glorious things, &gt;&gt; glorious things, supernatural miracles have happened right here in this building. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he was being seen being seen of them. Notice the way the scriptur is written. 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining uh to the kingdom of God. He wasn't seen of Caiaphas. He wasn't seen of Herod. He wasn't seen of Pilate. He wasn't seen of Pilot's wife. He wasn't seen of all of these various people that were so visible. But these that were invisible, they were part of his structure, &gt;&gt; part of his flesh and part of his bones. And they would rise and under the power of the Holy Spirit and take this message of his resurrection, he said, "You'll be witnesses of me." &gt;&gt; And here we are. We're part of his flesh. We're part of his bones. And all of us are witnesses of his resurrection. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. I'm getting started here. I haven't even haven't even got to the beginning. In Acts 4:20, he says, "For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and have heard." Others hadn't heard it. Others hadn't seen it. Maybe they heard a voice, but they didn't see who it was that was speaking. In Acts 26-16, Paul is telling of his uh of his conversion. And he said, "But rise," he heard this voice that said, "but rise and stand upon thy feet, for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister, and a minister and a witness, both of these things which thou hast seen, and those things in which I will appear unto thee." You know, there's no record of those men that were even with Apostle Paul, that close to the pillar of fire, that close to the voice of almighty God, creator of heavens and earth, that close &gt;&gt; and missed it. Somehow missed it. I'm not being derogatory on them. I'm just saying this confirms to us the election of God. I'll take one. I won't. I'll show myself to him. I'll speak. He'll hear me. I'll show him many visions. I'm going to bring him into the third heaven. Going to do all of these things. And the others weren't called to it. &gt;&gt; And that same God that makes that kind of selection says, "This will be flesh. You'll be a deacon or you'll be a preacher or you'll be an evangelist or you'll be a witness or you'll be whatever." And somebody might not be at right in this congregation. This church could not function could not function and could not God would not bless it with supernatural things unless it had those that were willing to be part of the structure. &gt;&gt; Never seen, never heard, never put forward. But they are bone of his bone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I had the title of this as bone of his bone, but I thought I'll change it to make it the body of Christ. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen. I'm going to come down to your world right now because I know that you become subjected to celebs, celebrities. I'd like to see them walking out, walking down the street in their skeletons and see how attractive they would be. That's what God sees. &gt;&gt; They're not only flesh, they're bones. Isn't that the truth? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And one day that flesh will rot away. &gt;&gt; In a very short time there'll be a pile of bones. &gt;&gt; But there were men in the scriptures who had a handle. They had a knowledge of God in such a way they said, "Don't leave my bones down there. Jacob said, "Don't leave my bones down in Egypt." &gt;&gt; And I say, "Oh, Father, we have been called with a holy calling. Don't leave our bones down here. &gt;&gt; Resurrect us. &gt;&gt; I'm here for a resurrection." Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen are not made of things which do appear. So I wonder now the scientists and all of these things they talk about a a mirror universe or another one. This one certainly can't be. I mean foreign earth we're we're standing on earth and we feel important people but the earth they say has been here for hundreds of millions of years and you're going to live what 70 80 90 whatever that's a very short period of time you're not going to live as long as the bark on the trees outside &gt;&gt; I mean that tree we cut it down use it for wood it's going to last longer than most people &gt;&gt; we're insignificant ificant without God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We're very insignificant without God, &gt;&gt; without eternal life. &gt;&gt; And here's a verse I want to stress now. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen. Isn't that a paradox? the invisible things of him. Now don't shut your mind off think you can't you many of you are students and university students etc. Others are teachers and teach Sunday school teachers or teachers in school. You can grasp this. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made. So the things that are made, the things that can be seen are evidence of invisible things. This isn't the only world. The prophet said, "I'm standing in two worlds." Well, do you think the one he was standing in simply because you couldn't see it was less important? No, by all means, far more important. It was an eternal realm. We call it another dimension. It's another world. &gt;&gt; There's another life. &gt;&gt; A life that was stronger than the life of the cancer that was taking this person to death. &gt;&gt; You're taking them illegally. &gt;&gt; You have no right to this body. Are you with me, friends? That you have no right to this body. Come out of her, Satan. Come out of him in the name of Jesus Christ. And that word still works today. You may be afflicted right in your chair now. You may be afflicted in your room now. But I say by the same authority, not from this world, but from another world that was poured into us and called us and elected us to be a special elected people. Satan, we have control over you. Come out of those people. Come out of the church of the living God. Do you accept that? Do you accept that? Come out of them in the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we just start at Genesis for a little background. And God said, "Let us make man in our image after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." So God created man in his own image. This was the invisible man. God is a spirit. The Bible says and the prophet says the first man he made was a spirit man. And the spirit man is not visible. Brother Brandon even when he was coming to the place where he would stand between two worlds or stand in another world I want to say to you I sat where you say are sitting and looked upon a physical man I didn't see the bones of him but I saw the physical part of him and I saw God use that flesh a God's a God saw him and used him in such a way that me as an individual who could not go there had to had to confess that there was another realm there's another place there's another world and he would step into it and bring down a knowledge so that my ears in this this realm I could hear it and he could speak it sometime would say can you hear me at the back can you here because he said I I don't know whether you can hear it and he's talking now he's bringing wisdom down he's bringing knowledge from another world going through this orphice or this vessel that prophet vessel called of God and speaking to humans the truth &gt;&gt; that made the thing that was afflicting them a lie &gt;&gt; who is proposing that lie upon them and say well I got this affliction, I have this medication. Listen, friends, don't let that that's fine, but don't let that be where they end your confidence is we're connected to another world. We're connected to another life, and we have a direct connection by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept and took one of his ribs. God took one of his ribs. &gt;&gt; Man tries to figure out which rib, forget it. God took it. &gt;&gt; Whether it's still there, we don't know. Whether it's gone, we don't know. But he took a bone. slept. And he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh thereof instead instead thereof. And the rib which the Lord God had taken from him made he a woman and brought her unto the man. So he took an invisible part. He took the bone, a rib, an invisible part and made. Think of the wisdom. Think of the plan. Think of the scheme. I'm going to make something that this man will have such a revelation about that he will leave his father and he will leave his mother and join himself to this woman. This that was invisible which I have made visible. He will join himself to her and they will live till death do them part. And Adam said when he brought the woman to him, and Adam said, "This now is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. she shall be called woman because she was taken from the man. And that's why you have a prophet that says they're both the they're both the man, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And says in the when she's manifested, when the bride of Jesus Christ, the bride of Jesus Christ is manifested to the world, both flesh and bones, both visible and invisible, that makes up the body of Jesus Christ. And Paul is writing, just in case you don't see it that way, I will rest all members of the body of Jesus Christ and those that are more in noble or more unseen. And you give them greater honor because without that, the body can't function. &gt;&gt; I hope I'm getting my point across. You that are married, your wives leave and are gone for a while and you have to make your own bed and make your own breakfast and so forth. I don't like it. And I and I even feel less secure. My My wife's not there to protect me. I'm supposed to protect her, but I'm more insecure when she's not there. I go checking the doors and make sure the doors are locked cuz I don't want anybody coming. My wife's not here to protect me. It's just a It's just a sense. And now if if if this is the body of Christ, that's the way Christ, he has a much just a grasp and understanding of things, how significant and how important every part is. &gt;&gt; And so you are members of my body. &gt;&gt; You are members of my body. What's he saying? He's saying, "I can't function without you. I'm not going to come down as a flame of fire. You're the only thing that people are going to see and not only see, but they're going to be affected." Jason, I just see you in for a moment. Excuse me. But you went to China with the school and you plan to, you know, interpret for the kids. So you'd use your voice and they'll see you and you'll meet your parents and you'll embrace them etc etc. But after some days, I just want to make my point. After some days, your father who had no outward inclination of having a desire towards godly things, was not a believer, was not a Christian, but he comes to Murphy and he says, "Whatever Jason has, &gt;&gt; I want." &gt;&gt; What is that? &gt;&gt; What is that? It's part of the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's the invisible part that has become visible through a witness. &gt;&gt; But the witness wasn't saying anything. The witness was just being a witness. Just just expressing a part of Christ, &gt;&gt; but that part's a living part. &gt;&gt; This congregation should be mature enough &gt;&gt; to catch that. &gt;&gt; And that's not deep. You might say that's very elementary. Then rejoice in the elementary part of it. &gt;&gt; He said the first man was in the image of God. This is in God's power to transform. 65. The first man was in the image of God which is spirit. John 4 says God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. But God is a spirit. And the first man that he created was spirit man. And he was in the image and in the likeness of God. And then he put this man in flesh. Watch this. Now I have this highlighted. Then he put this man in flesh and man fell. So then God came down and became in the image of man that he might redeem that fallen man. That's the real gospel story &gt;&gt; to my opinion. He said took man from the invisible world to a physical world and now is taking the redeemed back to the eternal unseen invisible world that we came from. That's why we talk about body change, but we kind of lose it there because we say, "How's that going to happen? I don't know how it's going to happen. He said it. &gt;&gt; I don't even know why I'm here. Why are you here? How did you come? Oh, you came by a birth, did you? Do you understand the birth? People don't understand the birth. Everything that happens in those last moments, a few moments when a child is born and takes a gasp of breath and mother and dad are there and you're looking at an invisible world. You don't even know what's happening. Science can't even figure out what's happening. &gt;&gt; And we're going to tell God what he's doing or God's word when it's right or wrong. Forget it, friends. We're We're so insignificant. We're only here by the grace and mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's true humility. I believe when we realize that we're not too much. &gt;&gt; And as God taken from Adam, is is that thy word? And as God taken from Adam a rib, unseen, I I'm I'm adding the word unseen. And made Eve out of it. He taken from the side of Christ, unseen. &gt;&gt; Taken from the sight of Christ and made the church out of it. And we together will walk in the paradise of God someday. Amen. &gt;&gt; In one of these uh quotes, it's a wonderful part. Brother Brandham was I was trying to explain it to my wife yesterday, but and I may not explain it to you, but some of you ministers might be able to take a hold of it. And and I hadn't recalled reading that quote exactly like that. He says, "And they came to break the bones, the legs of Jesus." And that was very prominent in my mind. I was reading that quite a bit. And they came to break the bones of it because the scripture says, "There shall not a bone of him be broken." And he says he drew back the hammer to break the bones. says, "And then a a a soldier drove the spear into his side, and out came blood and water into from his heart, and he said he was already dead." &gt;&gt; So, they didn't need to break the bones. He was already dead. And then he just goes into another world. He said the bride was already redeemed &gt;&gt; and it didn't need that. The bride was already redeemed. He says, "Now for those that are coming in the tribulation, they believe in Jesus, &gt;&gt; but they're not in the bride." &gt;&gt; See, oh, he just sees it all over the place, friends. And they'll go through the tribulation, but they're not in the bride. Friends, I'm so glad I can speak and say to this church and have breath in my body to tell you that we were redeemed. &gt;&gt; He took the invisible world once again. &gt;&gt; He took the spirit of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he became the he he became the uh the I don't want to say orphice but he became the vessel through which he carried that re power of redemption. &gt;&gt; And we became redeemed by that act. &gt;&gt; And when God says a person's redeemed and if you're in the mind of God, you're redeemed. There's no way to become unredeemed. You are redeemed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel like singing I am redeemed. &gt;&gt; I am redeemed. &gt;&gt; If anybody asks you who I am, tell them I'm redeemed. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Let the church say so. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Took from the woman. Took the woman the bride from the sight of Christ. invisible from the invisible world to the flesh brought it down and that's why the Holy Spirit came on the day of Pentecost and what was it that were like drunk people that were like humans that was flesh people that was flesh flesh of his flesh not only that bone of his bone &gt;&gt; life of his life &gt;&gt; you're not just making plans down here and going and getting ahead head. That's not it, friends. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not here just serving flesh. &gt;&gt; We're flesh of his flesh. &gt;&gt; Bone of his bone. &gt;&gt; Word of his word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's hear the people say it. Word of his word. &gt;&gt; Word. &gt;&gt; Word of his word. &gt;&gt; Word. &gt;&gt; And life of his life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She is him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. She is him. &gt;&gt; What he desires, we desire. What he wants said, we say. &gt;&gt; Where he wants a person to go, we go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have to have feet. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I haven't got some flesh. I got some bones in there. &gt;&gt; And the bones and the feet work together &gt;&gt; to accomplish the word of God. &gt;&gt; He said, "And who is this Melzdc? You come like Adam, like me. &gt;&gt; Talking to the people. You come like Adam. You come like me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You came like brother Brennan. &gt;&gt; You become from the attribute. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The invisible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the flesh. &gt;&gt; You have an attribute. &gt;&gt; You are an attribute. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You come from an attribute to the flesh &gt;&gt; to be tempted. Oh, we don't maybe like that. But that's why you came down. You become visible to be tempted. &gt;&gt; But you are an attribute. So don't just say, "Well, I'm, you know, my mother's this." And go back and figure out where you come from and all the rest of it. That's not important. &gt;&gt; It's nice to maybe find out. I've had several say to me every once in a while, "Why don't you go back and search your search your roots and find out? I think you're Jewish." Well, that's a compliment, but what does that mean? Does that mean I won't get older or you're Jewish? You're royalty. blah blah blah. You know, God has chosen quite a few in this message. It's royalty. &gt;&gt; What's that mean? Going to sit in a different seat. They're going to have different friends. So, it's nothing. &gt;&gt; But now I can say I have his the royal blood &gt;&gt; flows through my veins. &gt;&gt; Now you're saying something. You're saying a new creation. I'm part of a new creation. Hallelujah. I'm not part of this world. I don't love this world. I can't stand this world. And like Marilyn's song is, this world is getting cold to me. I'm getting un on I I don't have any affection for it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because my home is in another place. &gt;&gt; And that's not just a dream world. That's not some some fictitious something. That's a reality. &gt;&gt; You come like Adam did from an attribute to the flesh to be tempted. But when this life is finished here, and it will be, whether it's by change or whatever, if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one already waiting. &gt;&gt; Already waiting. Already waiting. &gt;&gt; How many can say already? &gt;&gt; Already &gt;&gt; waiting. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's where we go. &gt;&gt; That is the word. When we can look back and see what we done. Now you now we don't understand it. We have never become the word. We've just become the flesh man, not the word. But uh and and look, he said clearly makes it clear. You will never be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not saying you're not the word. Period. No. If you were a thought, you shall be the word. &gt;&gt; If you're a thought, you are whatever God thought about. &gt;&gt; He says, "But look clearly." Makes it clear. You will never be the word unless you were a thought at the beginning. That proves the predestination of God. &gt;&gt; You can be the You can't be the word unless you're a thought. Amen. &gt;&gt; You had to be in the first. But you see, in order to stand temptation, you're going to really think this is strange. But when Satan comes to you, and he does, and he will, &gt;&gt; and he comes to you with temptation, just tell him to get lost &gt;&gt; and come back someday and tempt your skeleton. Just tempt my bones. &gt;&gt; You know, it's the flesh we have problem with. True. &gt;&gt; Is this getting way off someplace? Anyway, as long as you don't say, "Oh, God, ship Brother Red off." I thought about this a long time. I thought about and I was thinking about you sisters and I thought, "Boy, people aren't going to understand this. How in the world do you get people to think about the bones?" Nothing very attractive about your bones. when you look and say like Dan Daisley gets up in the morning and in case you don't know Dan Dasley he was a little short stubby guy great big and you know and he wore real thick glasses like looking through the bottom of two coke bottles and he says he says he says every man that loves himself loves his wife or something like that you know and he says and he gets up in the morning and looks into the mirror and if you knew him as I did and he'd say, "You handsome dog." I thought anybody that could be that shape of a guy and say, "You handsome dog," he wasn't seeing very clear through those coke bottles. But if you could stand in front of the mirror and all you'd see is bones. tomorrow morning. &gt;&gt; Just bones. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't be very handsome either. &gt;&gt; But God put them there. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Put everyone there. You wouldn't want to be brother Tom and having being laying on a on a bed and I think they were pulling out the slivers of bones with the tweezers the whole ankle bone gone taking and the doctor saying you golf yeah he loved golfing said you won't uh you won't golf came. Why? It was the bones. Wasn't the flesh. It was the bones. Your whole life has changed because these bones are just splinters. What you did, what you enjoyed, what you loved, you won't do it anymore because the bones are gone. Brother Dave was David Jernoff was telling me when he laid under that truck and he said he was crushed. He's going to give his own testimony soon. We're waiting to hear it. But when he was crushed, he had eight ribs, eight bones, eight ribs broken. Eight. I've never heard of eight ribs broken. and he knew that he had to move somehow, but he was pinned. And if he didn't get that truck off of him and get free of it just so he could breathe, he'd be gone in a few minutes. Tell you what, friends, there will come a time there will come a time in your spiritual life, you'll find out that those that were not important in the church were very important. And the Bible says on those that are are seem in noble and they seem uh insignificant, heap more honor on them. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. God heaps more honor on them. &gt;&gt; I'm not done preaching &gt;&gt; now. You know, we're so affected by what we see. A theophony is something you could that you could not see, but it could be right here now. So that's what I want to get across to you. There's a there's a part of this message that we really are don't understand. And because we don't understand it, we don't give it any importance. And the prophet said that your theophony is here. And because you don't see it, you don't think about it. your theophony that when you were born, you bypassed that through natural sexual life, birth. We all came the same way and we all bypassed that. But he said it's here. &gt;&gt; It's waiting for you. This one that you have now by your mother you die. By the woman you die, and by the man I'm giving I'm giving quotes now to the scripture. By the man, Jesus Christ, you'll live. &gt;&gt; What came from his side, you live. But the body that came from your mother, by that you die. You get older and you just die. I don't know how beautiful you are or how how much sports you ability you have or how skilled you are or how smart you are or what skills you have or what you have in the in uh in the world. That's only for this world and I just want to tell you about it. It's just going to kind of fade away and fade away. you'll get where you're not so you're not so agile and you're not so quick to respond and that that'll just be natural. That's the natural that's this body. I want you to get acquainted with the one that's near you and that's the one that you feed when you feed on the word. Don't come here just to hear something. come here realizing that there's one beside you that needs to feed and it's actually a part of you. It's a part of you. It's it's if you're an attribute from God and you come from God, you have another I want to I want to give you a description of a bone. Hello. &gt;&gt; I don't want to speak to a bunch of skeletons. You're all you all got a skeleton and it's not very handsome or very pretty, but you're here in a in a body of flesh that God gave you. But inside you have a capacity. And that's that capacity that hungers after God. They that hunger after God and after righteousness. Invisible. Invisible. They that hunger. Describe your hunger to me. &gt;&gt; Describe Describe your thirst for me. &gt;&gt; Show it to me. &gt;&gt; Where? And I have so many people say, "Well, I love you, Brother Biscol. I I take it with a not a grain of salt, but a ton of salt so much of the time because I Brother Brenam says, "Well, you know what is love? go down to the drugstore and get me some. &gt;&gt; What is love? You it's it's it's it's invisible. It's part of a realm I don't understand. And I've had all kinds of I've I've married over a hundred young couples. Brother Tom and the other ministers, Brother John has ministered some more. I don't know how many others have been married, but I tell you, I and my wife, we're coming to an anniversary in in the spring. And I can tell you something about love that you probably don't know. And you wouldn't recognize it with the with the human understanding. You wouldn't recognize it. And don't come and ask me about it because I can't describe it. But all I can tell you, I I know enough about it to tell you that that most people don't understand the path that they're going to be taking. So if theophony is something that you have, it's yours. It's what God intended in the first place and standing beside you. And if you pass this world, you're going to go to it. Do you know the message? If you want to read who is this MelzDC, a theophony is something that you could not see. It could be here now yet you cannot see it. It's just like television. You all know what television is. That's another dimension. Now, here's here. This isn't an IT man. He's way beyond it. He's way beyond. We have men here understand all of that. Way beyond me, but they're not beyond this prophet here. People are moving right through this room now. I had to think of that. People are moving right through the Can you see them? No, you don't see them. There's people moving through this room. They got birth marks on them. They're in certain color clothes. You don't see it. And he said, "People are moving right through this room now singing. Do you hear them?" I can't hear them. He said they're singing. He said but the eye is only subject to five senses. So he said your whole being is only subject to five senses rather and you are only subject to what the sight has been limited to see. But there is another dimension &gt;&gt; there is another dimension &gt;&gt; and it is here. Whether you believe in it or don't believe in it or have your own ideas about it has nothing to do with me. Here's someone who was ordained of God to describe it for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you do well to ponder it very seriously that can be seen by a transformation by a television. There's another dimension. Now, television does not manufacture a picture. A television only channels it into a circuit and then the television screen picks it up. But the picture is there to begin with. &gt;&gt; Now we have a television. &gt;&gt; Someone who stood here and told a vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And spoke and the the spoke the words of the vision and the words of the vision got scribed onto paper. And you are so you are so privileged to be able to read what the television said, what the vision was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the television was here when Adam was here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Television was here when Elijah was on the mountain. On Mount Carmel, television was here when Jesus of Nazareth walked the shores of Galilee. We don't see him. Television doesn't pick it up now, but it was here back then. This is This isn't This isn't strange. This isn't weird. This is the truth. This is what's happened. This is what's happening. This isn't history. He's saying this is what's happening now. And your theophony is here. &gt;&gt; Your theophony was here. God God thought if you are elected, it it had nothing to do with the oh, Satan's going to get a hold of you and you're going to be brought down into a hell on earth. And that doesn't mean nothing to God. I've provided a way. &gt;&gt; I've provided not an escape away. &gt;&gt; They are my sons. &gt;&gt; They are my daughters &gt;&gt; and sin and hell can never have them. They shall not corrupt. &gt;&gt; You know what started this? &gt;&gt; You know what started this service? I'll just tell you. In the middle of the night, night after night, &gt;&gt; I think she's bone of my bone. Bone of my bone. I hadn't even read the scripture. The brightest bone of my bone. So I thought, I'll look at that. And you know what? the bone in the Old Testament and the bone in the New Testament. I don't know if I can just get get to it now. Will you give me just a moment? &gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you uh just from what I have been studying, is it all right for me to take my time like this? The bone is not the invisible. I've been telling you that. But it has to do with uh those that are uh the comy parts. C O M E L E Y L Y rather. Comely parts. And the calmly parts are those parts are uh calmly in in one translation is the the honorable the graceful perhaps elegant in figure in bearing oneself be in speech or behavior one in good standing. Just listen close now. Honorable, respectful, and something that a person has and holds dear. I'll tell you, you want to describe all those things. It is the the graceful part, the delicate part perhaps. Doesn't say it's ever weak. is strong. I I want to describe now you sisters for a moment. There are sisters here who have never said a word. They've never sang a song. They've never played an instrument. You are as much a part of the body of Christ as a man who stands behind the pulpit. You may not be eligible for a certain office. &gt;&gt; You may not be an evangelist or a pastor or a prophet or an apostle. You may not be eligible. You may not be a deacon. And there's there's churches out here will say you can be a deaconist. You can turn on the television. You can see them preaching &gt;&gt; completely haywire out of their place. &gt;&gt; I want you to listen close, but not any less important. They might be part of the skeleton because I want you to believe this word now. They are flesh of my flesh. And you may see the flesh of a deacon coming down the aisle and so on. You may see the flesh of the minister or the flesh of the song leader or the people that are playing instruments, but there is bone of my bone. And I can tell you in God's economy, there is not a single bone that is less important than another bone. And there's not a single bone that's less important than the most prominent of flesh. &gt;&gt; I said that because I felt I had to say it. And I'm continuing on. When brother Brandham was talking about the the unseen, the television, another world, he's he's not just talking about television. Let's not get hooked on that. Talking about there's another place. Let me say I feel like preaching. If you could just get a glimpse for the next three, four, five seconds of that other world, you'd never want to be in this one again. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me, kids? &gt;&gt; Do we hear me? Young people, you young attractive ladies and young fellows, you might be able to pump a lot of steel. You might not, you won't pump any over there. You wouldn't even want to say, "Oh, if I could just be there." And I'll tell you what's going to impress you is the Brother Bisclled. Brother Biscll and I can tell you I'll tell you a little bit about it. It was a place like where color and feeling merge. The color is just like emerald. Soft, beautiful green. And the feeling is like so so peaceful body, soul, spirit. You not a thought, not a problem, not nothing. Not worried about your job or not worried about a bill to pay. And you know the first thought that came through me? I said, "Just let me live here forever. I want to live here forever." It just just lasted a few seconds. And that's what it is, friends. And that's right beside you. There's another world. And you people are here. how privileged you are to to believe in a a prophet that God called. The people that say all kinds of nasty things and the people who turned against him, they didn't have a clue what they were turning because they couldn't see it. &gt;&gt; It was invisible. &gt;&gt; And just because it's invisible doesn't it's right here. It it's it's here. It's close as your next breath. And I can tell you every person here, I'm not lying to you. I'm telling the truth. If if you just had a few seconds there, you'd say, you'd be exactly like brother Bam. You say, "Do I have to go back?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do I have to go back across the curtain of time? It's only a breath away. And then he'd say something. This isn't some great great revelation, but I'd like to say I'd like to repeat. Yeah. He'd say, "Don't don't miss it." Whatever you do, don't miss that. And brother Ed is standing here today saying, "Whatever you do, don't miss that." I don't care what this world is, all all the stuff that you get in all engaged in. And you know we have at our homes and your families you have your soccer and you have your games and you have this and you have your school and you have your studies. Don't don't let it become too prominent. Just say I'm just getting through this world. Give it your best shot. Do your best. But just remember you're not staying here very long. What you learn will last you. And do your best. Be real be real diligent about it. Do your very best. I had to write this. I had to get this down on the computer again. And what you want to be able if if God gives you life upon earth see I I can say some of these things cuz I'm here but whatever I said and uh I had to I had to write and I pasted in my Bible all the way. If you ever get to be brother Ed's age or where you are right now, what you want to be able to say is all the way my savior leads me. What have I to ask besides? Can I doubt his tender mercy? Who through life has been my guide? You know, young people love to go to BCA. You know why I'm so dedicated to BCA? Cuz I'm a dropout. What grade are you in? &gt;&gt; Eight. &gt;&gt; Eight. What grade are you in? 10. That's when I dropped out. I didn't finish my 10th year. That is why we are so gripped in our heart. Something it's not visible. If I could have only been in a school where people prayed, it was so terrible and whatever was in me. One of the last things I remember they're having Satie Hawkins day. I said, "What? I've never heard of that." Well, that's when the girls are out cuz there's a dance or something going on and the girls get to pick who they want. And I remember riding my bicycle to school to big new high school, nice high school. It's the only time I was in that school. And I rode my bicycle and there's a girl standing at the front door. Bunch of them waiting for the guys to come from lunchtime. And I thought isn't for me. This isn't for me. Do you know why friends? Maybe don't understand it now, but there is something inside calling. I wasn't scared. I said, "This just isn't this isn't my life. This isn't my world." I was uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; I could yell to make it more impressive for you. But do you ever feel uncomfortable? It's because you weren't made for this world. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not because you are going through hardship or whatever you went through, but you don't feel comfortable here &gt;&gt; because it's you're not made for this world. &gt;&gt; You're made for another place. &gt;&gt; And God has prepared it for you. &gt;&gt; He said even a prophet comes here and says he he made it lovely for you. He made it for he you have certain likes and certain desires. He made it it just for his bride. He suited it out. Made it just perfect for her. &gt;&gt; This is so different for me. And now I'm I'm actually speaking just right of my heart. You know why? I said God I don't even know. I don't know how God provided. I don't I don't know how God I don't know how this building and I don't know how all this how all you people came I don't understand all those things but I can say one thing Jesus led me &gt;&gt; all the way &gt;&gt; and if there's anything I can say to you when you get there and you don't don't want to wait till you get there what you want to say this morning is I want I want him to lead me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What do you know about your future? Very little. What do you know about your skills? What do you know about what do you know about what's going to happen? You don't want to call on him in the midst of a disaster. &gt;&gt; And I appreciate what brother Dave was able to say when he's being crushed. It really affected me. He said there he was crushed under that truck and he didn't know if he was going to live for another five minutes. But he he thought, "I'm glad I don't have to make anything right." What a statement. I'm so glad I don't have to make anything right. Everything's okay. And if I have to go, I have to go. Can you say that, folks? Can you say that? Young people, can you say that, kids? It's okay. If he wants to take me now, I'll go. Serious business, friends. Serious business. But that's what life is all about. I just had to hold back otherwise I maybe would have gone into area that I didn't want to go. But you young men and you young ladies that you have a future. Maybe you have some marriage in your future. You want God to be your guide. You want God to be your guide. I'll tell you that you're looking towards a time that Satan's got all of his target on the home, the family, husband and wife. He's got all his target. He's got all his ammunition. He has all of his and you've waited for a short time. You think about marriage, whatever you do, don't step into a piece of hell. You're better to wait. You're better not to get married than to step into hell itself because it'll either be heaven or hell. And in in the best mar listen I'll never say this to you but in the very best marriages there's plenty of there's plenty of trouble in the very best marriages. But when you have flesh and bones both and you agree there's nothing that can stand against that. I don't want you to go from this building and forget this. When the scripture speaks about husbands, love your wives. She may not have the prominent place that you have, but you are too. Give more honor to the calmly part. Give more honor to it. I think of a man and he was a believer and his wife was not a believer and he wanted to know how he could cast the devil out of her. You know what the prophet of God, you know what the said? Buy our box of chocolates. &gt;&gt; And I know that. Yeah. Maybe we smile at that. No, he's giving you a big secret. &gt;&gt; You'll get more you'll get more distance and you'll get more achieve. You'll achieve more with a box of chocolates than trying to cast the devil out of her. &gt;&gt; What am I saying? Why am I saying this? Why am I speaking this way? It's because we are so human. We are so attached to physical things. We're so controlled by our senses and it's time that we depart from that and get in tune by the Holy Spirit. It might take more prayer. It might take more contemplation these messages. The reason I'm speaking from my heart is I I may not I may not be on my knees and wailing before God over what I should be saying, but I'm saying, "God, give me something that touches somebody's life." &gt;&gt; And I'm waiting on you and I'm I'm pondering these words and I'm I'm I I'll read something that the prophet did and then I'll say, "Why did he do that? Why did he say that?" And I seek to go down into it and to become a part of it. And I see something happen in the scripture and I I I read about it. The people did different things. I had different actions to Christ and he was the word. He's the word. We got the word and have different actions to him. I said why did they do that? Why didn't they offer themselves? Why didn't they? And it's like something says to me, what would you do? And brother Brandman then when he says you know you have to say yourself in the scripture where would you be what would you be doing in this I I I asked myself serious questions. Would I be loving him? Would I be rejecting him? Would I be just casual about this thing or would I you know and it takes more it takes more than just hearing it. You you've got to take it into yourself. And like I said in this prayer for this baby dedication, we gave her this name because she we want her to be tender. Not very many are tender. You were right, brother Rickard, Sister Andrea. Not too many are tender. Oh God, make us tender. When the minister gets up tonight to speak, oh God, make me tender. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've got pages more, but I'm not going to go any further. I'm going to ask you to bow your head with me. Dear father, you yourself know alone. You know how much more I would I could continue on and say and my human mind feels it may be important. But just now, Lord, I feel that there are people here. They're precious people. There are people that you died for, Jesus. You thought of them while you're on your journey to Goltha. You're thinking of them. I must I must give myself for them. They will hear it sometime. I'll have faithful messengers. And in this day, Lord, how thankful as my wife and I spoke on the way to to the church this morning. Oh God, how thankful how thankful we are that you sent our precious brother Brandham, a faithful one that would not he would not compromise on your word. He would say it even say things that we hear and maybe we cringe Lord because we think it was so hard. But yet from the things that he was seeing, he saw that harlot church. He saw the denomination. He saw how Satan was slithering around like a serpent using all these acceptable things in the world. acceptable to the flesh, acceptable to the human senses, acceptable but yet unacceptable to you because you had something better for them. It didn't stop at this life. It didn't stop in this world. It wasn't bound to these few things. And we see and we hear him say, the more what does science have in store for you? The more death it has more death and finer car, a nicer car, a nicer home. You have all of these all of these things, Father. You saw it all and how he would use it to his advantage. And yet you seek to point us to another place, another world, another creation, oh God. And you've left all of these special secrets, very very uh unique secrets. You've left them. And you sent a prophet to uncover them so that we could see them. And then you'd come into meetings such as this and touch our hearts and move upon us. Oh father, achieve your goals. Achieve, I pray. Oh father, these hearts are yours. The bride that you have called is yours, Lord. And we are here for one purpose. We are here to demonstrate our love for you. Jesus, my Jesus, I love you. I ask for the people whose hearts have been touched. Oh God, thou knowest. Thou knowest. [Music] Relax. [Music] I'd like to say, "Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. [Music] Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee. [Music] Speak my &gt;&gt; Don't sing it as a song now. &gt;&gt; Speak my Lord. Seek and I will answer. Lord, send me. Wonder if you'll sing it again. Maybe you like to stand. And I' I'd like to ask a request. This is a request from brother Biscll. Now, please don't sing it just as a song. [Music] Don't think we're at the end of the service. We're not at the end of the service. Going to continue on. You're going to think about these things after you leave this building. You're going to be thinking about these things. And I'm praying and it'll be different because I'm praying that the Holy Spirit this afternoon stay right with you, right by you, impregnate your mind and will not you will not be able to get it out of your mind. Don't try to get it out of your mind because I'm going to pray now that it will stay in your mind. It'll stay within you. Uh you won't be able to shake it. You say some of the things that I've heard, God affect my life. &gt;&gt; Let me come under the transforming power. &gt;&gt; Let me sense it. Let me feel it. Guide my footsteps. Lord, keep me out of trouble. Keep me from making wrong decisions. Keep me from any trap &gt;&gt; that the devil sets for me. Friends, you realize that the enemy is a lot smarter than any of us. &gt;&gt; He'll set traps for people they don't even realize they walk into them. Say, "Oh God, keep me from them." &gt;&gt; Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. I want you to say it. Sing it that you desire him to speak to you now. My scream my Lord. Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee. [Music] Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I will answer. Lord, send me. Now everyone singing please. Speak my Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, dear Lord Jesus. Speak my Lord. speak and I'll be quick to answer thee. Oh, speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I will answer. Lord, send me. While you're playing it, dear Lord Jesus, somebody may want to just if you feel to lift your hand, but above all things, just pray with me. Father, I would love to put my arms around the brothers, lay my hands upon the sisters and pray with them. And so I'm here now praying with them. Oh God, God of the future, God who's the same yesterday and today and forever. The God that has raised up messenger, our messenger, the God that raised up the ministry, the God that has called the bride, Lord. And many perhaps do not know what they've been called to. But let them realize that there's another realm that we are hearing a voice from another place. We are hearing, oh God, something calling from another world. Oh God, and it's a real place. We hear your prophet's voice. Don't miss this. Oh God, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, you'll prepare hearts, Lord, that they may live here like strangers. Let the people here live here like strangers and pilgrims. Lord, just traveling through. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, take these homes, take these families, and you will care for them. Oh God, you'll watch over them. Some of them may be right now in in the destitute straits or in some circumstance of life. They might have some family or children difficulties that is causing a pain to their heart. Let them know, oh God, that you're the almighty one, you have control of these things. We pray that you'll go out and deal with those that need to be dealt with. I pray, oh God, those that have been swallowed up by this world and this life, let let it all fall from them like a super structure. Let it fall away from them. Let them find themselves, oh God, hanging on to the the the very very shaky ground where they may be, but let them find, Lord, uh something solid that they can be recalled. Let a re let a recollection of a message they heard, something that was said, a sentence. Oh God, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you'll speak. Oh father, take the few words that have been spoken and take these words that have been uttered. Oh God, I know that it's reached down into the soul of those those that are here. I pray, Father, in Jesus Christ's name, that they shall not be able to forget those words. Lord, I pray that you will work with it. I pray, oh, Holy Spirit, I commit the message to you. I commit the people to you. I commit this day to you. This is the Lord's day. Continue to speak throughout the day, oh God, and bless your people, I pray, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. You know, a few days ago, uh, in the faith challenge report, Brother Matthew Redell, you sent me an email. I don't want to belabor this, but I want to I got another email from a pastor in another country. Said, I've read the Faith Challenge report. He said, "Now, I want to ask you a question. I still have to answer this." And it's it was quite long and detailed. He said, "You said in there, she hath done what she could." You've heard brother Murphy preached on it. Different ones have mentioned it. And he comes up with it also. And he says, "Now I'm wondering, I worked with Bible believers for some years. I am pastoring now for some years. But now I wonder as time has gone on, family has grown into their teens and maybe into their early 20s. I wonder now, what does God what would God have me to do? I'm asking the question. She has done what she could. I wonder if I've done what I could. And and that's what I want to leave with you. We want to do what we can. Oh God, maybe convey something from your just live some kind of a I want to say to you graceful. You are the you are the people of the earth that is able to extend a real grace. This is not emotion. This is not sympathy. This is not just holding somebody's hand and helping them through life. But this is something that I want to convey and I'm saying this in my last comments. You possess it. You hold it. Hold it to yourself. You have a certain grace that God has given you. You're not just flesh of his flesh, but you are bone of his bone. You're his dignity. &gt;&gt; You're his grace. You're the essence. And that's a word that I hoped I wouldn't forget during this service. You're the very essence of his being. It's not something that you do, but it's something that you are. You possess it. You possess it. And God sent you this message. He sent you this message. Young people, you think you hear the message, the message, the message. He sent it to you to give you qualities that this world can never give you. He sent to give you things uh uh certain graces and certain qualities and and and certain things that are in impossible for me to describe. But I can tell you one thing, they will be resident in your life and in your body. They'll be resident in your home. They'll be resident with your family. They'll be resident when you meet as it was Joshua. Uh Josh unsaved father preachers couldn't move him. Maybe other things can't move him, but it's something that is is so impossible to describe, but I'm here to scream it out to you. It's real. &gt;&gt; It's absolutely real. Absorb it. &gt;&gt; Let it soak in. &gt;&gt; It's real. I'd ask you to go home and when you leave this place, ask yourself this question. What did a female dear? What kind of sermon did she preach to a man that brother Brandham said had kind of lizard eyes, real man, and blew a whistle in this life in the visible world blew a whistle of a wounded fawn or a lost fond dear and a big mother do steps boat in front of the gun in front of a evil evil hunter, shoots to kill. And brother Brandham, here a prophet that you say is a prophet. He's your prophet and he stands there. Oh God, don't let him do it. Don't let him blow the loyal heart of this mother dear out just for sport. Don't let him do it. And he's got a gun up. I want to ask this congregation, what kind of a sermon was she preaching? [Music] &gt;&gt; What was she conveying to him? Tell me about it. Get me a glass full of it. [Music] go down to the store and buy me a dollar's worth. Buy me a $100 worth of what it was. And I'm saying to you men and women of this congregation, don't let us stand here and take that so in such a casual way or so flimsy. That was real. &gt;&gt; She was real. She was conveying something. I'm saying something to you. You have a right. You have an essence. You have a possibility to take the substance of this message. Something that's indescribable. Something that's unseen. But take that unseen. Say, "Oh God, let it exude out of my body. I don't even know what to say. I don't know how to say it. I don't know how to describe it, but there needs to be something within me. Oh God. Oh God, I grant I I I pray he grant it to you in Jesus Christ's name. Now I just unloaded my heart a little bit more and I say God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. It's 1:00. I don't want to keep you any longer. You go pondering these things. God bless you. [Music] Quick correction to the announcement that I made earlier about the Sunday school. There is not a Sunday school practice at 3:00. It's for the helpers. So, if you're one of the helpers, make sure that you're there at 3:00. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
