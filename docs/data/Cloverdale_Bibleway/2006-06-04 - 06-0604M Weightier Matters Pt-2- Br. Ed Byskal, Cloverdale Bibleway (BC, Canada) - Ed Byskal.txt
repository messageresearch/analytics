I just want to thank the Lord for his grace towards my mom and bringing her through her operation. She is doing well. And thanks to all those who prayed. Um, and I'm going to ask our brother John Andy's. Brother John, if you'd come and open the service this morning, word of prayer. Uh, Anna, my daughter, is requesting prayer for u friend of hers at school. Uh, Jeff McCertie was sidestripe swiped by a semi as he was driving home from work on Wednesday night. And uh, she is praying for a quick recovery as he's in the hospital with several several injuries. Sister Kalista wants us to pray for her brother Francis. He needs the Lord to come through for him in a situation. Um there's a request for brother Tim Perkins, Uncle Tom. He's going in for open heart surgery. Pray that all is well and it'll draw him closer to the Lord. The Frey family this morning is requesting prayer for Jonathan who's at home running a high fever. Our brother Mark Lowry is requesting prayer this morning for sister Deborah. She's at home not well today. Uh, brother Alex is requesting prayer. Um, his mom phoned the day on uh on Friday and said that uh his brother had was in the hospital with a vein in his brain that uh broke and flooded his brain with blood. His brother is 39 years old. Does not know the Lord yet. Requesting Lord will use this situation to wake him spiritually and save him also for healing his body. Amen. How many have a need this morning? They want to be remembered before the Lord as we go to prayer. If you're listening in on the internet, on the phone, hookup, you've got a need this morning, just ask the Lord right now to meet that need. Amen. John, it's wonderful to be a Christian this morning. Amen. Be on the Lord's side. &gt;&gt; Father, we lift up our hands in your presence. so grateful that we can say that we're your children and you're our father and everything that we have need of is in your presence and in your word and by faith we're reaching through the veil of flesh and doubt and unbelief and negativism and this worldly system. So good to come to your house and be a free people. Be able to lift up our voices and our hands and worship you. You are worthy of our praises. You are worthy of our adoration. Oh, Father, you have healed us. You have saved us. You have filled us. You have brought homes back together. You've done miracles among us. And we just love your presence. And we love to be able to revel in your in the freshness of your nearness. Oh God. We invite you this morning right now in this service in a special way, in a divine way. May you come breaking through and cause there to be things happen that are supernatural alone. That we as your people would stand back and praise you. That lives would be healed even yet while they hear the word. That sicknesses and cancers and illnesses would be afraid at the atonements in effect. Lord, that lives would be delivered of backsliden cells and everything that is not of you and of perfect health that your children would be delivered in the house of God. We do not accept childhood illnesses. We do not accept middle-aged uh infirmities. We do not accept the excuse that it is just age. We have been promised a well body and we receive that this morning. The blood is still sufficient. Those stripes are still in effect, oh God. And so, Lord, would you heal your people? Send out a great wind of your presence. And may lives sense that coolness of your spirit and the angel visiting this address today. Father, we claim deliverance for lives that are bound. Even as a body of believers, we unite our hearts together that nothing would stand before the believer's prayers. That nothing would stand before their hearts. Lord, we love you, Father. We confess that you are more than sufficient to meet our heart's cry. May you burst through spirit realms, shackles fall off, walls come crushing down. That the Holy Spirit would be released into hearts that are dark and dingy and and discouraged. May hope come breaking through an array of hope today. bring life out of the situation and a fresh birth of your spirit, Father. Even those on the internet and those that are connected and our hearts, Lord, are burdened with these requests, Father. Lord, you know each one of them. Even before the semi swipe swiped the vehicle. Even before the vein bursted, Lord, and the blood went into the brain. Even our sister Anna that I believe is coming home this morning. We commit her to you, Lord. And other needs and their prayer requests, we lay our hands on them. Hands are lifted up all over the building because we believe you. We believe you and our faith is united with your word. &gt;&gt; Bless the minister this morning. Lord, if he steps out of the way and we as the congregation step out of the way, what could happen today? &gt;&gt; We sense that something is going to happen. &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, we just invite you to have total and complete control of the service. May everything that is fleshly and carnal be submitted to the Holy Spirit that the word would have access in every area. We praise you already for the testimonies. We thank you for what you're going to do. We thank you for what you're doing. Hallelujah. We praise your holy name. Hallelujah. Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ. Fill every vessel with the Holy Spirit. May there be no room for Satan to hide. May there be no room for his access, but may the Holy Spirit have such a freedom today. May there be a spontaneous eruption of the Holy Spirit that lives that are bound would be set free in your house. This is your house. Do whatever's in your heart to do today. And we love your appearing. We love your grace. We love your mercy. We love your power, Lord. So thankful for the blood. So thankful for the power of God. So thankful we are not a dead religion. So thankful we are not a denomination. So thankful we are not earthbound but we are eagles Lord and we want to soar today where all things are possible. Bless your people. Feed the flock. Minister Lord in places that only you can minister in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Amen. [Music] We've got a baby dedication this morning. Uh and if we get uh brother Nathan, Sister Heidi to bring the little one up. Well, this is a special event this morning. We always uh deem it a great honor and privilege to dedicate our children back to the Lord. Um this morning, Eliza Christina Davies is going to be dedicated to the Lord. And um I didn't know whether we we want to say that this is the the cream of the pie or the sugar and spice that's going to make everything nice in the home, but I know what it is to have boys. And uh and a little girl is something special. And uh the Lord has granted to Nathan and Sister Heidi a little girl this morning. They have given me a little bit of um a testimony here. I'm going to read, but I'm going to read it with the scripture Nathan you sent me in the email. It's very appropriate and I believe a milestone for Eliza to live by. Out of Job 33, Brother Nathan gave me this scripture. The spirit of God hath made me and the breath of the Almighty has given me life. &gt;&gt; It's tremendous, tremendous scripture. And this was the testimony they would like to declare before the Church of the Living God. Today, we publicly want to thank our Lord Jesus for the miracle of our healthy baby Eliza. Prior to Eliza's birth, the doctors warned us that because of the lack of amniotic fluid during the critical time of her lung development, Eliza may have insufficient blood vessels in her lungs to support life. At birth, Eliza had to have maximum life support, and the doctors told us not to get our hopes up until she made it through the following four or five days. Our confession was that God had already given her the blood vessels she needed because we believed his word and saw God had had his hand on her before her birth. &gt;&gt; I said, "That's tremendous." And that's why you can take a scripture. I believe we are the word bride that we can take our experience, go back to the word and make a declaration. It is the Lord God that hath made me and given me breath. &gt;&gt; This is God's grace. To the doctor's amazement, Eliza came off the respirator after only five days. And many other miracles have happened along the way in the answer to the saints prayer. And today Eliza is completely healthy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And here's the public uh confession. Brother Nath Heidi would like to say we'd like to thank the congregation, the believers in the prayer meeting and others around the world who prayed. Eliza is a testimony that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. I say to God be praised that he can have a mother and father of this character. &gt;&gt; A young man that has known his God and a young woman that has known her God from her youth. Eliza means an oath of God or to take an oath. It's a binding of the worshipper to the God they worship. &gt;&gt; The Bible declares of it comes from the root Elizabeth which says that Elizabeth was righteous before God walking in all the commandments and ordinance of the Lord and was blameless. I say may God so anoint this little Eliza that she had walked before God in all ordinances and through the blood of Jesus Christ come to the reality I'm blameless faultless and guiltless before my God who gave me breath may his hand ever be upon her life. Sister Heidi, God's blessed your home. You have sought God in your youth, Nathan in your youth, and God has grant to you the very desires of your heart, and we want to give God the praise. All right, let's pray. Father, cradled in my arms is a gift from God. &gt;&gt; You've blessed the home. You've blessed Sister Heidi, Brother Nathan, Lord, abundantly. You've given them boys. And now this little girl, may it be a joy in the home. And may she realize early in her life of who her creator is, this lovely Lord Jesus, the spirit of God that has given her breath to breathe. May your hand ever be upon her life. May you keep her in the center of your will. And may, Father God, the windows of heaven be ever opened upon her life. I'm sure this morning, Lord, the grandparents on both sides can lift up their eyes and say, "To God be the glory. Great things he has done." Lord, what a heritage this little Eliza has this morning. Grandparents on both sides serving God. Mommy and a daddy serving God. And may Lord God she raise up early if you should Terry to serve this living God our lovely Lord Jesus Christ. We dedicate her back to you this morning and giving you all the glory, the honor and praise in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's a miracle working God and he's still Hebrews 138. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we've got uh Darl, Sister Nicole visiting with us. Um Sister Nicole's sister Jennifer and uh somebody else is singing with him. I don't know who, but anyways, they know who it is. If you could come up at this time. Also, we one other announcement I forgot to make. We got the grad for all the uh young people at church that are graduating from high school this year. And that's happening on uh the 12th of January. So, a week Monday now, or June the 12th. I knew it started with J. Anyways, um uh they made the serious error of of putting Randy Snow and myself in charge. And uh some of the grads have not yet got us the pictures. Now you have to have them to us today. If you don't have them to today, then brother Randy and I are going to take our liberty to make some stuff up. So you believe me, you don't want to have that to happen. Grads who haven't I think there's about 10 of them that don't have pictures to us yet. And also now another thing I want from each one of the grads somehow someway get to me this week or to brother Randy. We need a little overview, something that we can say while the pictures of yourselves are being shown in front of everyone. And again, if you don't get us something to say while the pictures, you can write a poem, you can do a little, you know, whatever you want. You know, the pictures that were sent, so you can you can provide us with a description of those pictures or a a uh just send us something to read while those pictures being shown. And again, if you don't send us something, then we'll take our liberty to make something up. So, [Music] Who am I that the Lord of all the earth would care to know my name would care to know my hurt? And who am I that the bright and morning star would choose to light the way for my ever wondering heart. Not because of who I am, but because of what you've done. Not because of what I've done, but because of who you are. I am a flower quickly fading here today and on tomorrow. A wave tossed in the ocean. A vapor in the wind. Still you hear me when I'm calling. Lord, you catch me when I'm falling. And you told me I am. I am yours. [Music] I am yours. Who am I that the eyes that see my sin would look on me in love and watch me rise again? Who am I that the voice that calmed the sea would call out through the rain and calm the storm in me. Not because of who I am, but because of what you've done. Not because of what I've done, but because of who you are. I am a flower quickly fading. Here today and gone tomorrow. A wave tossed in the ocean. A vapor in the wind. Still you hear me when I'm calling. Lord, you catch me when I'm falling. And you told me who I am. Not because of who I am, but because of what you've done. Not because of what I done, but because of who you are. I am a flower quickly fading. Here today and gone tomorrow. A wave tossed in the ocean. A vapor in the wind. Still, you hear me when I'm calling, Lord. You catch me when I'm falling. And you told me who I am. I am yours. I am yours. [Music] I am yours. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you're in his care? Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows what is going to happen tomorrow. He holds the future in his hands. I'm so thankful that we serve a living God. So thankful the blood will never lose its power. As brother brother's going to come now and minister the word. Let's sing together number 24:26. I think we can start with the chor with the verse. The blood that Jesus shed for me will never lose its power. Do you believe it this morning? Sing it with me. Oh, the blood that Jesus shed for me. [Music] Oh, way back on Calary. [Music] The blood that gives me strength from day to day. It will never lose it. Glory reaching to the highest [Music] and to the gives me praise from it will ever his power. Oh, and it soos my temp and it calms my fears. Oh, and it cries on my tears. The blood that keeps me free from today. He will never lose his power. Oh [Music] to the highest to the Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] Reaching to the highest might [Music] give We pray from day. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Let the people of the Lord say so. &gt;&gt; We all have been beneficiaries. of the blood of Jesus Christ, this bleeding word. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's just stand and let's sing. I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the lamb for sinners slain. Give him glory all ye people. For his blood has washed away every stain. Amen. Hallelujah. I will praise him. I will praise him. Praise the Lamb for King for his blood has washed away each day. I will praise him. Yes, [Applause] I will praise him. [Applause] [Applause] Glory. Holy Jesus for his. How we thank you, Father, for the sacrifice of Calvary that you made this available to every one of your children. And we stand here today, Lord, saying, "I am redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ. We're a happy people, Father. We're a happy family. Your grace has been so abundant to us. And on behalf of all the people that are gathered in the visible audience and those in the invisible audience out on the internet on the telephone hook up and those that will hear the archive service, we pray that the same anointing that is present with us now will flood the rooms and the buildings where the people are assembled. And may it be a mighty mighty move of God upon their soul. May the church, the bride of Jesus Christ, may that bride body be built up, Lord, to its final place and the final one to come in, oh God. And may this final message that is being sent out by the bride of Jesus Christ, I pray it will accomplish all you have intended it to do in Jesus' name. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a good day. We had a glorious time at the open house &gt;&gt; for all that were able to be here. And uh maybe I'll just allow you to have your seats for a few moments if you don't mind. Uh, I think there was about perhaps as many as 400 people that actually came through and went on the tours through the church. I came and my wife and we went on one. Uh, it was an eyeopener. How many people that came through and uh didn't realize what goes on behind the scenes? Let me see your hands and hold them up. I got to put up both of my hands. I I've been involved in almost well, I guess every every area in almost every detail, but there's a lot of things that I just didn't know. Uh, and don't know exactly how it all takes place, but it was it was just really remarkable. I want to uh I have the concept the idea we should have an open house but that's that's a simple statement you know and talk is cheap sometimes a lot of work has to go on behind that then brother Tom took a hold of it and uh we begin to develop some thoughts and ideas and brother John Andy's came to uh our assistance and without the efforts of brother Tom and brother John. It just would not have been the evening that it was. And I want to thank them each one for their effort and the work that was done. And then all the various departments of ministry because it was their idea. Let's get all the various departments of ministry and have them say something and let's put a video together. And so the video brethren got together. So there was all the departments of ministry which were the duplicating and the groups went through each of those areas. Brother John, brother Tom took a hold of it and timed uh how many might be in a group and how long it might take and then had each one of the different departments write a paragraph of what they would need to say in order to describe what it is they do in order to send this message. to have it duplicated or to give the sound in the sanctuary. So, and then each of them would be standing and saying uh what it is they do and describing it to every group and I think there was about 19 groups. So if those various areas and the groups started at 15 persons but 15 we saw that it wasn't going to or those in charge saw it wasn't going to uh we weren't going to get through all the people so it was increased to about 20 and 25 and someone told me that one of the groups had about 27. Well, that really is almost an overload. But by by the time the evening was over, if those that were speaking in all the different departments, if they didn't have their uh paragraph rehearsed, I tell you, they knew it well by the end of the day. Uh there was a duplicating uh area, the sanctuary sound here, the internet sound and the brothers were there. Then the internet streaming and the brothers that sit there, the video edit suite up here and uh and the two parts of the video editing and the streaming from the sanctuary that is done from handled from there and then the translation live translation which is taking place at this moment up here and the Chinese Vietnamese the French and other languages. Uh, and things are being put into place right now that we'll be able to handle a number of languages simultaneously, which we are able to do now, but we'll be able to put on the internet live while the service is in progress. And uh uh it it it just moved me because as brother Murphy began to actually preach the service that was coming up and for those you went through I don't know what you experienced but I can't hear that. I I sense the anointing of God come on the on brother Murphy while he was doing it and it starts to break me up because I can just imagine what that must sound like to someone who does not understand the language English language that the prophet brought the message in but are able to hear it live like that with a dedicated anointed voice I tell you friends it's a I feel highly very privileged to even have any part of it and then from the uh from the translation then went into the missions department where brother Tony was and spoke to the people of all the various areas and works and even in our group I was surprised when he said how many don't have the last believers faith challenge report that's put out some time ago and several of our own people hadn't hadn't picked one up didn't have one yet. And I think if you're here and have not seen that there's a lot of work, not just gone into the faith challenge report, but when you think of the people that are scattered all over the world in the areas where God has opened doors for our congregation to be able to work in, uh then you know that a lot has gone into it before it can even be put on paper before you can receive it in your hand and read it. So when you read it, you must know that there's months and months and months of the working of the Holy Spirit all over the globe that has taken place before it can even be put in words. And so then you want to have an appreciation for that. And thank God that you're privileged to be able to hold that in your hand and read of the working not of man. If it's of man, it will pass away and become nothing, but the working of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then up through the uh Bible way Christian Academy and uh the school uh there were just so so many remarks. And then while all of that was taking place and the groups were going through from two different directions so we wouldn't end up too many in one spot at one time. And it was timed very very lovely. I I know there were people that had to wait a wee bit but it was um it it went very very smooth. And then uh the the young people were here singing so that the live streaming and the video editing could uh have something live that was happening. So the young people, many of them, maybe 50, 60 of them here singing and others singing uh specials all evening. And some of the people that were had uh you know, just had to step in and sit down and and so there were a lot of people at different parts of the building being able to hear that. Uh the video that the brothers made for the evening was being played constantly in the toddler's room there. So I want to thank all of those that participated and were in that uh uh gave so much of themselves to have the evening for the church and for all who wish to come. the young people and the guides out of the young people, the senior young people who acted as guides and took the people all through. Then I do not want to forget, you notice I'm not mentioning names here because I couldn't even begin to mention all the names, but all those in the congregation who worked to make uh they worked in the yard. They powerwashed and sprayed the fence and did all the landscaping and and where the curbs were broke and fixed the curbs and did all kinds of things throughout the church. Things that were uh I I couldn't even have dreamed said, "Well, the door jambs are scratched. We need to paint those." And the brothers were here and if anybody had a few moments on their hands, they weren't they weren't idle very long and they were doing something. I can say all the hands really uh uh did a just did a masterful job and and I want to thank you because I believe it shows something out of the pre out of the people's heart when they want to have the place where we worship to have it nice not to have it run down. I believe that's important. you you pride yourself in your homes and you like to have things neat and clean and I think that's good and I think it should be that way and when we come in the house of God see all the message books uh neatly put in place made accessible to us never we won't want to take it for granted do we and uh so it was a very special evening brother Tom do you have a comment about that all Right. &gt;&gt; I'm always moved when you see what God does. And after we had gone home after the evening, Joanna and I were standing in the kitchen and I thought I went back into my mind of a young couple that moved out from Toronto by the voice of God and said, "Go west." not knowing where they were going and knowing that there were there were people that needed that ministry, needed that voice, needed that type of word to shape and mold them. And I thought after walking through and and we did, we put a lot of hours in to do what we did and to see the people blessed and you coming up, different ones, brothers move said, "Hey, I didn't realize the brothers are doing all this." I said to one group of brothers, I said, 'Well, in a lot of churches, maybe one or two are are working behind the scenes, and we're sitting here this morning, and you know that there's 11 brothers working whatever they can do to get this word out. And I thought, that's amazing. That's 33 times through a week, and we sit here and rejoice. And I thought, you know, Brother Ed and Sister Ruth going home, I I I trust in some little way God could just give them a little window to see how much we appreciate lives that have been poured out, not just for us, but for around the world. And to see that there's God's got his mighty band behind. One man can't do it, but we're all there and have a Tony and a different ones and we're all doing our portion. I thought, Lord, would you just give Brother Biscll and Sister Ruth a little taste of a little bit of satisfaction to know their lives have been used for the glory of God? And I believe we've been blessed. Bride of Christ have been blessed. And I say, Brother Biscol and Sister Ruth, bless you. And we're just fruits of your labor. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'd like to give a hand to all of those that worked so hard to make it all possible. And uh I didn't expect Brother Tom to be saying those things or I wouldn't have had him up here. I think I can take just a few moments. Uh there's always something special that happens just you know something a little unique and brother Lyall Black uh dear friends from long ago and sister Sherry his wife with him and we were going through and I we just happened to I said to my wife we got to go through and one of these tours and so we'll associate ourselves with one of these groups and so we were in their group and we were up here. And and uh so brother Michelle says, "Okay, now over to you." Uh I think it was brother Philip Ashdown and Michael Ray. They're sitting here looking down at these windows and says, "All right. Uh now what we're doing here," they said, "Now we're taking the live shot of the picture." And here we have one right here. And now I need to merge some sound with this picture. And so here we here we are at 5 43 2 1 Phillip. All right. Now give me the sound now. The sound is merging with this. And it was going like this. And when they when they finish this their spiel they said is there any questions? Brother Lyall Black says, "Yeah, how old are you fellas?" I thought that was a very good question. One says I'm 20. I'm 24. It was about that time. I just ready to bury my head and walk out. You know, you just get feeling that way. But God has to raise up those that don't only have talents and skill, but have to be dedicated. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're thankful for that. I need to bring you greetings as of this morning from uh Brother Isaac Noriega. Had a conversation with brother Isaac Noriega in Tucson. And for those of you that don't know, brother Isaac Noriega has wonderful translators in his church and they are translating on a regular basis and they send their discs up here and that's the Spanish goes on the internet of the message. Brother Gido from Belgium sent a brief email yesterday. He just just returned from Siberia where he's been for quite some time. They had very great opposition. He said almost physical almost became physical but in spite of the opposition God gave them wonderful victory. Uh several were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or orphanages were visited and the believers were built up and encouraged in the meetings and that's what it's all about. And he's going to be sending a report that we'll be able to give you in a few days. um as my sister an sister Anne was discharged this morning and uh so I think her part of the family are picking her up this morning. So thank you for your prayers on that on their behalf and I enjoyed that song by uh the message sisters sister Nicole Towns and Sister Jennifer Gray and her daughter. I enjoyed that song. All right. Do you mind me taking that little time? Would you mind standing? We're going to read some scriptures. A brief scripture reading in Matthew 23. Scripture reading from last Sunday. I'm just going to read one scripture and it is verse 23 of Matthew. And before we read, let's just look to the author once again. Almighty God, your word, our Bibles are being opened. We're going to read them. But it takes much more than human understanding. It takes much more than what each of us have learned in our school years where we learn to read. Lord, it takes now the Holy Spirit to inspire the very minds and the hearts to take Lord my lips I pray this morning and express your thoughts oh God by the Holy Spirit of God in the name of Jesus Christ we now s dedicate and surrender ourselves holy to you in Jesus Christ's name amen Jesus Jesus speaking once again, "Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye pay tithe of mint and an annis and come and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith. These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone." I will be uh spending most of the service this morning on the judgment aspect. And uh this judgment is the discernment or the distinguishing between one thing and another making a valued judgment uh decision. And then I want to read out of second Corinthians the 4th chapter just two verses verses three and four. 2 Corinthians 4, Apostle Paul writing to the Corinthians, "But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not." So if you'll watch that closely, the God of this world, if he's a god, then he's being worshiped. The god of this world hath blinded and he hath been successful hath blinded the minds of them which believe not. So to doubt or to disbelieve causes a blindness. And it says, "Lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ uh who is the image of the of God should shine unto them." May God take his word now and and bless it to our hearts. You may be seated. Keep your Bibles handy. We will be reading later on. Now, Apostle Paul said that the god of this world hath blinded the minds. And that word blinded here is is to blunt to blunt the ma mental discernment. So the god of this, in other words, to question. So the scribes and the Pharisees, for example, they were always questioning Christ. They were always reasoning and and trying to, you know, determine how they might uh uh not only question Christ, but question him at and at from such a direction and uh so that they might catch him or trap him. All of that was because they didn't really believe in him. They didn't believe he was who he was. And by by disbelieving that their very act of trying to bring that into human reasoning uh and the fact that they were questioning it actually blunted their mental perception so that then they were incapable of making a clear decision. That is a and that is the blinding part. And so this I want to uh focus on some areas of our lives. And each person here is is party to this because we live in the world but we are not of the world. That has to be a very clear distinction in us amongst us here. But because we live in the world, we are involved. We are interacting on a daily basis with the world and with those who are of the world because we are in the world. There are many areas of our lives which are essential. We are essentially involved with we are involved with our children being educated. We are involved with our work, our profession uh uh business that we may be in. We are involved with um worship. We're involved with uh a church as such. We're involved in many of those areas which are not unique to us because everyone in the world pretty well uh is involved somehow in that but part of it there's a very very slim percentage of it that is actually of God and the rest of it is part of this world &gt;&gt; and that takes a divine discernment of God to know between one and the other. &gt;&gt; And I want to take it a little bit further to say that there are there are many of these areas in fact most of these areas of our lives that are essential to us and we find ourselves moving in them because uh and this will come very very clear to you in just a short while. But as our lives go on, we are moving in these areas of our lives. But it is, and I'd like to expose Satan today, so he's not going to like this message. But Satan is determined to try to have those areas of our lives kind of swallow us up until what that son and daughter of God who is in the world, he would like us to become so uh so swallowed up that we become uh almost captivated and controlled by that which is of the world. &gt;&gt; Has that been clear? If it's not clear, it will become clear. Now, uh we happen to be we are uh we are in a bride age as believers. But although we are in a bride age, it's like Jesus said, we are in the world, but we are not of the world. We are in a bride age, but yet we are also in a Leodysian age. We are not of the Leodysian age. We happen to interact with it &gt;&gt; every day. We're in that last age that uh that there's only seven of them and we're in that last age, but we are not of that age. We just happen to have to interact with it every day of our lives. Now uh Jesus said concerning the uh Leodysian age and it's a it's an age which is a homogenization to become lukewarm. It was described as being thou lukewarm and lukewarm is just a homogenizing of hot water and cold water and it just becomes and you can't find the dividing line. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. Where is the where is the divine discernment? Who is going to uh guide us? So we uh and he said I sooner have you hot or cold because lukewarm is just a you know it's just a homogenizing of the both and that is this generation. Oh, everybody believe, you know, believe whatever you want to. We have to accept people and there there's no uh and and and quite often there's a lot of resistance to you having a firm conviction about something because if you do, you're a bigot. &gt;&gt; And I don't agree with that. I say a person that a person that doesn't stand up for their convictions, uh they're they're they're not even a man or a woman. You got to be able to stand up for your convictions. But then you're not being honest with yourself. &gt;&gt; And so in lukewarm to be lukewarm is something that is halfhearted, &gt;&gt; un unenthusiastic, apathetic, indifferent or laxidasical. Right. &gt;&gt; So Jesus was saying there is a there's a this age is kind of halfhearted and unenthusiastic and apathetic. A condition of the soul. Lukewarm is a condition of the soul that wretchedly fluctuates between dormcancy, being dormant, inactive or a numbness, and hot or cold. The hot part is fervor and zeal and dedication and eagerness and commitment and and love. A a real zeal. And so now just watch. People have started out and many of us can no doubt identify this. Start out and we're all invigorated and we're enthusiastic and we're zealous and so on. But as time goes on, &gt;&gt; as time goes on, &gt;&gt; it just gets wearing on that. What wears on it? What is it that wears on it? What is it that saps that out? The world. So, we're in the world, but we're not of the world. But it's that which is of the world that is draining and and exhausting and takes away from that fervor and that zeal and that enthusiasm. Oh my. And that activity and pretty soon it becomes more inactive and more apathetic. And not that we want to, but that's the effect of the world. And we got to say, when do we say this thing stops right here? This has gone far enough. And I've got a discernment of the Holy Spirit, and I'm not going to allow the world to have that effect upon me. &gt;&gt; Glad you're catching it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham, he's he he preaches a sermon and it's a looking at the unseen. And we heard brother Tom preaching a couple wonderful services, the last two. Not that those were just the only ones, but those were really appropriate at this time. And that we have to look to the unseen by looking at the unseen, but not seeing everything that not allowing everything we see to have its effect upon us. We look at the unseen and bring and by faith bring the invisible and have it materialize in front of us. We need to be looking at what the real issues of life and what is the purpose of life. Otherwise, we'll certainly miss the mark. And brother Brandham had preached this service sermon. Then he went into prayer. And this is what I think every preacher has feels this way sometime after sermon. He said, 'Lord, let this little broke up message tonight that I have fumbled around over here trying to find the lead to something that I would break that would break a revival and it seems like Lord, I just can't find the spot. We preached a whole service. It's all done. Feels I fumbled around. I've tried to find the leadership. I've tried to find the spot and I just couldn't find it. Seems like the people still can't get in it somehow. And the word goes forth and I'm sure that the spirit is here. Lord, what is the hour that we're living in? It's the hour of numbness. &gt;&gt; It's the hour of numbness. It is the hour that the church has been lulled asleep by the things of the world &gt;&gt; and by all kinds of things that they should not have listened to. &gt;&gt; Is that our here Lord? But it had such an effect on him while he said it kind of brought the people into a numbness and the numbness which is that is what that either hot or cold that dormcy and inactivity or numbness. Not that we want that, not that we desire that but that's the effect of what's what is of the world. And then he goes right after that immediately just simply starts in. He says right back over in this corner, I see a man. Do not know him. Never seen him in my life as far as I know. Mr. Cop, stand up. Jesus Christ makes you well. &gt;&gt; Here's a lady sitting here right here at me praying and she's saying, "God, be merciful to me." &gt;&gt; What dimension is he in? He says, "That's what she's saying. God, be merciful to me." You were praying. He said, "Oh Jesus, let him call me." &gt;&gt; That's what she's saying. You were saying, "Oh, Jesus, let him call me. Mrs. Hoist, you may go home and be well if you believe &gt;&gt; after a fumbled up message, &gt;&gt; after perhaps feeling he hadn't hit the spot. I've been trying to find the place." But it happens because the world invades our minds and causes us to be numb. &gt;&gt; And that fervor, where's that fervor of years ago? Hallelujah. I thank God we got a young conver uh a congregation. But it's nothing saying that an old waror. &gt;&gt; Amen. An a laborer, a godly sister such as we have here in a congregation. The scripture tells me we can remain like Caleb. We can remain full of fervor and zeal and the faith of the Holy Spirit and believe the promise of God. Do not be weary and welloing. &gt;&gt; For you shall reap if we faint not. And we shall not faint. &gt;&gt; We're not We're not of the age to faint. &gt;&gt; We're of the age to go on in. &gt;&gt; That's our promise. We claim that promise. We are here as believers. &gt;&gt; We're We're not here as unbelievers. We're here as believers. &gt;&gt; We're not here to go through the motions of some brand of religion. &gt;&gt; That's not why we're here. &gt;&gt; We're deeply committed &gt;&gt; to this gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Although we are committed, as I said a moment ago, we're not immune &gt;&gt; to the spirit. that's in the world. We're not immune to the fact as the Apostle Paul referred to it. He said this present evil age. We're not immune to this present evil age in the sense of the word. We're not immune. We are immune to it, but we're not immune to the interaction that we must have &gt;&gt; from it. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul taught the Corinthian church. He called it that the God of this evil age hath blinded the minds of them which believe not. The scripture which we just read and brother Brandham calls it this world as Satan's Eden. God's Eden he said was established in righteousness and Satan's Eden is established in sin because Satan is sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; God is righteousness and God's kingdom was established in righteousness and peace and life. And Satan's establishment is in sin and it's remarkable and religious sin. This world that we rub shoulders with, the world that we interact with daily, it is this world that Satan has designed upon the basis of science and beauty. The challenge for the believer is to discern the subtle approaches of Satan. and to resist those approaches &gt;&gt; that he attempts to impose upon us &gt;&gt; in our daily lives by his reasoning and he reasons with us that we need it. &gt;&gt; He reasoned with Eve that she needed &gt;&gt; this experience that her eyes would be open and it'd be like God's knowing good and evil. No, notice he was promising her a discernment at the same time blinding her to discernment. &gt;&gt; And that is his tactic. &gt;&gt; He promises that we're going to be uh achieving something when in fact he's blinding the people from achieving their goal. Now, when Jesus rebuked the leaders, the scribes and the Pharisees in our Matthew scripture, and I'm just giving you some background here, he rebuked the leaders for having omitted the weightier matters. And that is the same thing. It's it is it is a neglect of them or a disregard. That's all it is. It's not saying I don't believe it anymore. It is something crowds in and and and then the important thing becomes neglected &gt;&gt; or disregarded. And that's what Jesus was saying. He said, you've disregarded these important things and you've made you've made uh the things that are less important as being very important. And so he said you've left off judgment. And that judgment is that discerning between what really was important and what was not so important. &gt;&gt; And so that's what we're talking about this uh this discernment. And I'd like to also make a reference to the line of demarcation between what is important, what is not important. The line of demarcation between what is what is right, what is wrong. Hey, sometimes that's not a very very clear that's not a very clear line. &gt;&gt; You've all been there. uh you know what is right, what is wrong, &gt;&gt; what is clean, what is unclean, what is holy, what is unholy because there gets to be areas that we are that we have to approach and are brought right in front of us and they they call it gray areas &gt;&gt; and that's where we really need discernment because that's where Satan fosters those gray areas. &gt;&gt; So that's what we're that's what we're dealing with. So Jesus is saying here is not that they that they do not have judgment. He didn't say you don't have judgment. He said you've omitted it. You've neglected it. You do have it, but you don't use it. &gt;&gt; You see? And so willingly to willingly neglect or to forsake it or to disregard the judgment that God has given us. So it's entirely possible that we as believers, we come to areas of our lives where sometimes we don't know what to do. Sometimes we know what to do, but we procrastinate. You know what that word is? &gt;&gt; We procrastinate the decision that we know we should make. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to ask you for your hands because we've all done it. And anybody wouldn't raise their hand. I don't think would be really honest with themselves. We said, "Well, I know I really need to I know I really need to say I'm sorry. I know I really need to say forgive me." And some may still be hanging here, still waiting on that one. &gt;&gt; I know I should really do this. I know I should really do that, but you know, I and and we can say, "Well, why are we not doing it?" Well, because we're just procrastinating. what we're doing is neglecting &gt;&gt; from doing what we know we ought to do or saying what we know we ought to say. So it's the dividing line. But now the real line that I want to talk about now for the next short while is the dividing line between what is the world because the scripture says a great deal about the world. &gt;&gt; The uh I have I have the scriptures. I don't want to take the time but the Bible speaks about the cares of this world. The children of this world. Jesus said I am not of this world but he speaks of the prince of this world. The prince of this world he uses more than once. He speaks of the kingdom is not his kingdom is not of this world. &gt;&gt; He said where's the denter of this world? The world has dissenters. People that want to argue and then he and then the world has a wisdom and God has already called the wisdom of this world as foolishness. &gt;&gt; He says the princes of this world he refers to the wisdom of this world. He refers to the fashion of this world. He refers to the god of this world. He refers to the course of this world and the darkness of this world and the poor of this world. And he refers to his kingdom is not of this world but in the end of the scripture in revelation all the kingdoms of this world become his kingdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's this world that I'm speaking about. And there is a line, &gt;&gt; a line of demarcation, &gt;&gt; amen, between what is of the world &gt;&gt; and what is involves those that are in the world. Now, I've been uh I've been really stressing that we are in the world, but not of the world. And so, when does a thing become of the world or remain as an essential part of those of us who are in the world our lives. That's a big question. That's a very important question. I've taken all this time now to build up to really this critical spot. When is it that something that is essential part of our lives, I'll bring it down real simple. We're all dressed here this morning. We all have our garments on. And that is incredibly important. &gt;&gt; Because without that, it would be sinful. &gt;&gt; It would be a shame. It would be a disgrace. But it's an amazing thing that while we are here clothed in our right minds that Satan can take that very thing that's an essential part of Christian living &gt;&gt; and take it with a spirit of fashion &gt;&gt; and move it on out &gt;&gt; and impact lives of professing Christians and move them on out until they're enticed and enchanted &gt;&gt; and and bring them garments that are ungodly &gt;&gt; and are of the world &gt;&gt; and bring that which is to clothe and to cause a person to be in holiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. and then as a moderate to dress in moderation and take them out in a and especially the lady of the world or the lady of of even the believers because it's a sacred body &gt;&gt; that God has given certain graces for life &gt;&gt; and for motherhood and Satan would like to take and cause that body to be one that would be looked upon and lusted after and bring it into condemnation just by the very way it's dressed. &gt;&gt; Taking something that is of a godly essential part of our lives and bring it right on out until it's it's something that would bring condemnation and damnation upon the person. &gt;&gt; And to put it very very bluntly to take it from a godly place to where it would stand before God, brother Bram says as a prostitute. Right. &gt;&gt; So that's a long ways. Where's the line? &gt;&gt; Where's the line? I say it is it's God's responsibility to speak which he has and it's our responsibility to listen &gt;&gt; and hear. When that voice gives that little signal inside &gt;&gt; thus far and no further. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You go beyond this line, you'll be of the world. If you stay on this side, you are in the world. But if you go over here, you're of the world. It's the world that does this. And so what what was godly yesterday can be worldly tomorrow. That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says that a woman's body has been given these graces and Satan is, you know, he's the designer of fashion. &gt;&gt; Satan is the designer of fashion. So, he wants to accentuate the movement of this sacred body. wants to show the form of it and wants to cast it out before the world and bring it down into disrepute. I say that's an incredible just an incredible disgrace that he's trying to impose upon uh we're not talking about we're not talking about uh the the those that are sinners already. He's already got those. But upon believers That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, that is just uh that's just a a small part. Now, Jesus said in his prayer in John 17, I'm only going to read four scriptures. He says, "And now I am no more, I want you to catch this, in the world, of the world. I am no more in the world, but these are in the world. And I come to thee, holy father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are. Verse 14, I have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world. Even as I am not of the world, I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. Where's the evil? It's in the world. &gt;&gt; Verse 16, they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world, but they are in the world. These are in the world. Keep them. &gt;&gt; Amen. While they're in the world, keep them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; While they're in the world, keep them from the evil. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John, he was speaking to the same religious leaders, John 8:23, and he said unto them, you are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world. There's a incredible statement. Drinks the same water. They drink. eats the same food they and dressed with the garment like they're dressed and all of these things looked entirely to be in the world the same as they're in the world or of the world like they're of the world. But he says, "I'm from above. You're from beneath. You're of this world. I'm not of this world. There's a distinct line. You can't you can't homogenize that. You can't make that some indefinable line. That's a clear line. &gt;&gt; You're of the world. I'm not of this world." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we've got to be able to say that and feel that witness within our own heart. I am not of this world. Amen. &gt;&gt; In a message contending for the faith, he said, "No matter what it seems like and what others say, the religion of Jesus Christ has never been popular &gt;&gt; and it never will be popular because the world knows its own and you are not of the world when you become a Christian. You are a different person from the world. And we know that. &gt;&gt; You know that. But I want to re-emphasize it. You are not of this world. &gt;&gt; This message is not of this world. It didn't come from this world. It didn't come hatched up in a Bible school or some school of theology. It came as Apostle Paul's doctrine came. And it's the same as Apostle Paul's doctrine. It came by revelation. &gt;&gt; And not only that, Apostle Paul went now, he was gone for years and he came back, just reading it last night, came back to Jerusalem and consulted with the other apostles who had been with Jesus Christ and who had recorded his words. And they found that what Apostle Paul received by revelation and what they had heard from the mouth of Jesus was exactly the same thing. &gt;&gt; Now if they had already heard it, why did it need to come by revelation? It's because God is a God that reveals himself and that is how he instructs and that's why Apostle Paul became the apostle to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even more so than the apostles who heard the word from the lips of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "I pray I pray, Father, that they not be of the world, so you're not of the world." Now these various areas of our lives, Paul said to Titus, teaching us that denying ungodly and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age, this world, which is a a the an arrangement or the the this cosmos, but having the character this worldly. It says a little bit differently that the denying ungodliness and worldly lust or worldly is those things having the character of this corrupt age that we are in. Now I I want to take worship for a moment. There is a true worship that is in this world and there's a worship that's of the world. Now, if you take your Bibles, would you please turn to Numbers the 21st chapter and we're going to read just a few verses here. Numbers 21. And we're going to start to read at verse one. And when King Aar the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies, then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners. And Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities. And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites. And they entirely destroyed them in their cities. And he called the name of the place Horma. And they journeyed from Mount by the way of the Red Sea to come past the land of Edom. And the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. I just want you to look this way for just a moment. Now, this we're at a critical spot here. Now they have prayed to God, we need this victory over this evil king and if you will do this for us, we will serve you and we will destroy this wickedness. We'll cleanse it out and we will destroy all their cities and so on. But then the people journeyed after that victory and all of us have experienced marvelous victories. He journeyied after that victory and they became wearied with the way just normal life. There was no other great battles that they had to they just become wearied with life. And I can say here there's not a man or a woman that has begun to assume the responsibilities of life that at some point in time you're not always dancing around and skipping along the way. You get weary with life. &gt;&gt; You just plain get weary. Young people that go to school and they go with their big bags of their uh of their homework and they've got they've got projects to do and they've got to study and make them get themselves ready. I don't care what area of life it is in. Uh it may be a wonderful life. You may be fit and in good health, but you become wearied with the way. &gt;&gt; You can be silent if you want. But I know that's the case. &gt;&gt; And and that happens to be when that happens, you have to be very very alert and very very discerning because that gives opportunity for Satan to to come in and and then people, you know what, they need discernment at that time. And I'll tell you why. Because things begin to kind of go reversal. this isn't my expectations haven't really been met in this relationship or in this marriage or in this home or in this church or in my employment or whatever more and uh and uh for whatever reason and at a time like that then suddenly uh if you haven't got the exact correct godly discernment if you don't if you're not careful you start blaming the wrong thing &gt;&gt; the wrong person &gt;&gt; you know what I mean &gt;&gt; say Well, while this is happening, maybe it's, you know, uh, uh, who I'm working with, it's their fault, not my fault, or it's the boss's fault, or somebody below me fault, or somebody in the church's fault, or it's the deacon's fault, or the preacher's fault, or it's my wife's fault, or it's it's my somebody's fault. &gt;&gt; But maybe that's not the case at all. You just become weary in the way. And you got to kind of uh uh gather your resources together and say, "I'm a believer. I'm a son and daughter of God and I'm not going to lie. I am at this spot. I am at this difficulty, but God's going to see me through it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm a real spiritual Israelite. I'm a son of God. I'm going to come through and I'm going to crest every wave according to the prophet's promise. &gt;&gt; Everybody gets wearied with the way. But when they got wearied with the way, the people spake against God. Verse five, they begin to blame the wrong person &gt;&gt; just because they were weary. &gt;&gt; And they blame blame God and they blamed Moses. Wherefore have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in this wilderness? These people just come through great victory. You know, it's always been amazing to me how soon people can forget the grace of God in their lives. How soon they can forget the mighty deliverance that they have experienced. And how soon they can forget the pains and pains of sin &gt;&gt; and forget how desolate it was, how dark it was, how confusing it was, and the terribleness of sin and the darkness that you were in and the bondage that you were in. Don't forget Egypt friends. &gt;&gt; And don't forget the marvelous deliverance that God gave you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he broke the chains and set you free. &gt;&gt; Don't forget that. &gt;&gt; But they got wearied in the way. And by getting we wearied, they began to complain against the wrong ones. &gt;&gt; Wasn't their fault at all. What they should have said, you know what? This is the tough way. &gt;&gt; They should have said to one another, &gt;&gt; "Let me have your hand, brother. We're going to make it. &gt;&gt; We're going to make it. &gt;&gt; We've got the word. We've got the prophet of God. We've got thus says the Lord, and he didn't bring us out here to die. He brought us out here to go into a land, and we're going to go into it." Hallelujah. God didn't bring us here to wither out in Leodysia. He brought us here to go across in the rapture. That's why he brought you here. &gt;&gt; If he didn't, then we ought to close the doors, close the service, go home, eat, drink, and be merry, and have a best time that you possibly can. &gt;&gt; But we are not of the world. We are in the world. But we're not of this world. &gt;&gt; But because we are because we are in the world, we are interacting with it. We are affected by it and afflicted by it from time to time and become weary with it. And so they complained against God, complained against Moses. And the Lord sent fiery verse six. Verse six. And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, &gt;&gt; and much people of Israel died. Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore, the people came to Moses and said, "We have sinned, and we have spoken against the Lord and against you. Pray unto the Lord that he may take away the serpents from us." And Moses prayed for the people. And the Lord said unto Moses, "Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole. And it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he lookth upon it shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon the pole. And it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived. Brother Bram says in God identifying himself, God's characteristics identified in Moses, a pillar of fire was following him. He also had the atonement in action. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not speaking of it, but he had it in action. &gt;&gt; He didn't just speak about the atonement. He had it there working. &gt;&gt; He says, "Not what will be, but what is right now." Now notice he had a brass serpent and that being had been lifted up for the sickness and diseases of the people. Therefore, Moses was practicing divine healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wasn't some, you know, uh, educated people that were helping them when these vipers or these serpents bit them. He had he had divine healing. The prophet said he had atonement. The brass serpent symbolizing that God was in the camp. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The brass serpent &gt;&gt; that was lifted up on a pole symbolized that God was in the camp and they just had to look on it &gt;&gt; and they were healed. &gt;&gt; Wasn't that simple? &gt;&gt; I've been bit. &gt;&gt; Look in the wrong direction. Look this way and see it &gt;&gt; and you're healed. &gt;&gt; Simple. All I had to do was believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all they had to do is believe it. &gt;&gt; If they said, "Uh, you know, I don't believe it. I don't accept that. I'm just going to look here. I'm going to stare at the ground. I'm going to I'm going to suck this bite. I'm going to get rid of this venom myself." They died. &gt;&gt; I've been told by my grandparents that when you get bit, you need Next fellow says, "Well, uh, what's this got to do with that brass serpent?" &gt;&gt; I mean, this is a live bite. And that's a live snake. And my granddaddy told me in our religion that if I just cut that a wee bit and suck it and press it and do this and do that and do the other thing and put some pus on it, it will draw that venom out and I'm going to live. He died. &gt;&gt; He died with all of his reasoning and all of his efforts. But if you just look to the brass serpent, they had divine healing in the camp and God was in the camp and atonement was in the camp and they were healed of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; They kept that brass serpent &gt;&gt; until finally there was a king on down the road. &gt;&gt; And that king inherited this serpent, this brass serpent. And he was a godly king. His name was Hezekiah. &gt;&gt; And he inherited this brass serpent in his uh in his reign. And it came to pass in the third year of Hosa, son of Elah, king of Israel, that Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz, king of Judah, began to reign. He was 25 years old when he began to reign. Say young man. He was 25. I show you what a 25-year-old boy can do. Young man, not boy, but a young man. And uh 25 years old when he began to reign. and he reigned 29 years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Abi, the daughter of Zachchariah. And he did that which was right in the sight of God, in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father David did. And he removed the high places and break the images and cut down the groves. This all had to do with worship. And he destroyed the images and he cut down the groves because they used to go in the places where the trees they were very very highly regarded. And uh and he cut down the groves, special places where they would go for their worship. And he break in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made. For unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it and called it Neah. the very serpent that God raised up &gt;&gt; as a emblem of atonement and divine healing. They took that and they kept it of course because God had never told them whether to destroy it or what to do. But that thing which was of God evolved in their worship and in their lives until they begin to give it a place it was not supposed to have. And that brass serpent became an idol. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon makes quite a few references to it. Get this perhaps even becoming a little more difficult for you. But Jesus, he said in in a in uh I'll just I'll just read it for you. after this one amazing amazing scripture which we love so dearly. And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the son of man which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Marvelous scripture. The next verse says, "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up." Here Jesus is identifying himself with the serpent that was lifted up in the wilderness because it was it was a brass being an emblem of judgment, divine judgment. And Jesus was going to uh take upon himself all the judgment, the divine judgment for all of us. &gt;&gt; Your judgment's gone, friend, because Christ bore it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; But as a and so it actually typified Christ and yet they took that thing. &gt;&gt; That was lifted up for the sickness of the people. And the Bible says, I'm sorry, in the in the message, it says in the in God manifesting his gifts, it says, "And the brass serpents in the wilderness, the brass serpent in the wilderness, the people looked and lived, that was a type of Christ. And if the type healed them, what will the antitype do? &gt;&gt; If the brass serpent made like unto the son of God who was made sin, the serpent was an emblem of sin. brass the judgment. So the brass serpent was a emblem of sin and of judgment and and if looking on at that serpent they lived what of them looking at the Christ &gt;&gt; and live &gt;&gt; in the one true living church. I need to just get a couple more quotes. As Moses lift up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the son of man the same reason. And now that serpent was God's provided way for healing for many, many years. And after the serpent, the people got to worshiping the image instead of what it stood for. I want you got your thinking caps on now. They begin to worship the image, the structure of the thing instead of what it stood for. &gt;&gt; It says you can make a god out of anything. &gt;&gt; You can make a god out of your wife, out of your husband. &gt;&gt; You make a god out of the piano. &gt;&gt; You make a god out of anything. &gt;&gt; Because it begins to take a place. It's not not what it stands for but you make a and it becomes an image within itself and he says uh and after the serpent the people got to worshiping the image the serpent instead of what it stood for and that brought the people under idolatry in the uncertain sound. These sound similar now. The brass serpent was all right. See, the brass serpent was all right. There was no condemnation in the brass serpent. But when they begin to get away from God and worship the serpent, the prophet tore it up &gt;&gt; being led by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now look at the serpent. The the brass serpent in the wilderness. Did you know the prophet had to tear that serpent to pieces? Why? Because the people were worshiping the serpent and they made an idol out of it. He said, "Do you believe you can do it today? You can make an idol out of your church. You can make an idol out of your pastor. You can make an idol out of the out of an evangelist." He says, "And I'm afraid that there's a whole lot of it's being done." They idolize the man. &gt;&gt; What about What about a sports idol? &gt;&gt; They're not ashamed to call it an idol. What about a movie star idol? &gt;&gt; What about a television star idol? &gt;&gt; What about a politician idol? Whatever it is, you can idolize and they begin to idle idolize the image of the person. Not necessarily their physique and so on, but they begin to idolize it. And rather than and some of it now is strictly of the world. But my message this morning and I hope that you are really being able to lay hold of it is I'm not concerned of those things that are of the world. Let them be out there. &gt;&gt; But there are things which are essential. I call them essential. Your job is essential. Your education is essential. I've I have dealt with people who commence their education and I would say it was their education essential let's say absolutely was further education essential I would say in many cases absolutely and today more so than in the past &gt;&gt; and I would say you know get whatever education you can but can education become an idol I'd say absolutely Amen. &gt;&gt; I have dealt with people who are way up in years and have become professional students. &gt;&gt; And there's a, you know, there's just a like a a a hunger, a hankering, a thirsting, a yearning for more and more and more and more knowledge and perhaps with no special direction to it. Now, I don't think that's something that plagues us here. But on the other hand, on the other hand, that is exactly what I'm I'm bringing to you is that there are things that are an essential part of our life, but it it begins to and when does it become a god? When it begins to control you &gt;&gt; and tell you what you can do and what you can't do instead of you telling it &gt;&gt; what you're going to do. Now, brother Brandham says, "Now, idolatry is a strange thing." He says, "Now, the order for this idol worship is the man that sets up an idol. He fixes the idol. Then he goes in and prepares himself for this great worship." Now, he believes that this idol is made in the image of some god that he has never seen, and he's he's without form. So he believes in the image of the idol that it makes that he makes to his god. And he says, "Now don't let that leave you. The image is the image is in the image of the mythical god that he believes that it is." Now I was I was reading where it was saying that there is in every human mind a craving for visible forms to express religious conceptions and this tendency does not disappear with the acceptance or even with the constant recognition of the pure spiritual truths. It's really amazing to me how that uh and I think that uh perhaps uh the younger portion of the congregation may have more uh I'm not too sure but they may have more care that needs to be taken along these lines. Uh I don't know how many of you maybe get the National Geographic but we've gotten the National Geographic since so many years I don't want to even think about them. But the last one they of all things usually it has something to do with you know nature and so on there they get on to the soccer game soccer if you read the first page which I hadn't read. My wife said you ought to read this first page. She didn't know what I was studying. She said they've made they say right in there that soccer in Europe especially is an absolute religion. And they they quote a scripture. They quote a scripture and it just just slips me right now. But it they quote a scripture and thou it's like something like thou has done great things wherever we are glad or something like that. And they just bring it right down. And they bring the whole article completely filled with spiritual connection all the way through, showing that it is literally a religion. And to show that that it's it demands the devotion of the people as does religion. And then they even take a knock at religion. They said a and it makes people violent as does religion and they will expend themselves and do whatever they need to do as will religion. But I think they took a whack at religion saying well but but they don't get to a soccer game and tried to devise a way to kill another nation &gt;&gt; as does religion. And it was really incredible. And you talk about devotion. I mean, and it actually becomes political because one nation against another uh and and how they'll finally meet. They've been in opposition and they and bitter hatred for years. But then the two teams of those bitter nations will meet on the soccer field and a whole political process starts of of kind of healing and bringing those two nations together. But if the one team if the wrong team wins, they've got a riot and they got a political almost war going on. Now don't tell me that they haven't made a religion out of it. Don't tell me that they haven't made idols out of those people. You know, this may seem very distant and and far from you, but it is it's astounding to me how that those people who you don't say are a star to you, but how the effect of how they act and the way they speak and the kind of music they listen to and how they dress and perhaps just even the way they wear their clothes or how it does how it seems to permeate &gt;&gt; down through the whole society until someone who's innocently living in the world and is a believer on the Lord Jesus Christ and as a walks in the light of the message but that thing permeates and s sets its tentacles right down and comes into your home by a magazine, &gt;&gt; by a newspaper, by an advertisement of somehow and Satan is there trying to capture a a little bit of your mind. &gt;&gt; Ah, that's the thing to do. Oh, you really need that. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That's really true. That's very, very true. And that is where we need discernment. Amen. &gt;&gt; We need the discernment of God. Now, I have I'm going to be closing shortly, but I have I have followed through with last week's service, the way to your matters. And I want this to be part two. But I have a subject that I want to give you now that I've called. The subject for this morning's service is the gods of Leodysia. And the longer we live in this age, I would say the keener the discernment we need. &gt;&gt; Jesus said these words and we we know it so well. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will s with him and he with me. Oh, a lot of people like to make this the door of your heart. He was trying to get into the whole age through the messenger. He was saying, "Behold, I stand the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and s with him and he with me, they will have fellowship." That that's they they will have a a a fellowship together. My question is, what were the people doing that were inside? &gt;&gt; He was outside, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They had a form of worship. They were worshiping. &gt;&gt; There was worship going on in there. &gt;&gt; But I can tell you it was vain worship. &gt;&gt; It was worship of the world. &gt;&gt; But not by true worshippers that are still in the world. It was of the world. And obviously Jesus Christ was not the one being worshiped because he was outside. &gt;&gt; You get my point? Amen. &gt;&gt; So inside they're obviously worshiping and in the message how can I overcome the prophet says and then look at Leodysian church age after it has received the Holy Ghost and with the knowledge of the spirit of God within it and then the works of God is denied by it and it's called an evil work. Then what about that? There's where Christ was put out of his own church. It it never showed him in the church until it came to never showed him in the church until it came to Leodysia. And when he got to Leodysia, he'd been put out of his church trying to get back in. Now, I had had just spoken a little bit earlier of a fashion. I brought it because I wanted to get your thoughts right into right into the uh into the subject. Now, brother Brandham says in Jehovah Gyra. He said, "I was trying to find Oral Roberts this morning on the television that sits in my room and I finally found it and I went ahead and I was taking a bath and shaving and so on." He says, "I I I looked upon the he says went out to see what was going on and my said the most ungodly things trying to advertise skirts for women and said it showed every move of their body. God making a woman such a high thing that she is and would degrade her mind." Now, I want you to see, please, this congregation and all who are listening and streaming. Now, we we don't just have a man there looking at it. Now, we've got a prophetic eyes. &gt;&gt; Now, you you might have looked at it. You might have looked at it and maybe it'd been disappointing to you or disgusting to you or repulsive to you and you'd just say, "That's that's so repulsive." you know, and make you upset or whatever more. But now catch this place. He say he's seeing it a little bit differently and see what's going on. And my the most the most ungodly thing, trying to advertise skirts for women that showed every move of their body. God making now here he says on the one's hand God making uh such a high thing that she is lifting her up such a high thing that she is and now he's on the other side and would degrade her mind when God put a sheepkin over to hide her and she went and she went a knitted dress to show every form of her body. Now, you know what this ended up doing? I tell you very plainly. America went the direction and I can give you I can give you quote after quote after quote until she became a goddess. Satan was successful at taking a body that was given for bringing life, bringing life into the earth and and causing it to become something that would be looked upon and bring it to such a degraded place, something that God had lifted up. Then people have the audacity to say, "Brother Brandham hated women." &gt;&gt; That's a lie. &gt;&gt; He said he's he's standing there with truth because he said, "I love them. &gt;&gt; I love them with a godly love. &gt;&gt; I He doesn't want to see that happen." &gt;&gt; And so now here's something. You see my point? Here's something that's I'm trying to bring a protection to this congregation. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to bring something of protection to our young people, our young ladies. When you go out there and you go shopping in these stores, remember Satan is the designer. &gt;&gt; He has designed it. And you need to ask yourself, is this going to bring me uh be is this going to bring me before the public and cause God to be disappointed and cause the Holy Spirit to be grieved? &gt;&gt; When when he's actually bringing this for my protection, Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know it may be quiet, but it's absolute truth. &gt;&gt; And there's a godly way to approach that. And for men as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. For men as well out there. We're not here to to hit the fashion standard. &gt;&gt; We're here to be modest. We're here to be properly clothed. We're here to be clean. I believe that sisters, you know, even the prophet says they like to look lovely and I think that they should. I think that's perfectly fine. But when you say anything, this is going to accentuate my body or accentuate a part of my body. This is going to bring me out in front of the eyes of lusting men and not only man, &gt;&gt; the lusting world. &gt;&gt; And by God's grace, I'm I'm drawing a line. by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; There's a line and I feel in my soul I feel comfortable. I feel at peace on this side and this is pushing the boundary too far &gt;&gt; and I'm going to deny it. I love the thing. I love the garment. I love the make. I love the tag. I love the manufacturer. whatever more but I'm denying that because it's pushing the boundary &gt;&gt; the heaven &gt;&gt; and it moves it from I am I am I am in the world but I'm not of the world and I've come now to the conclusion this is of the world &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; and that applies to all the areas of our lives it could be my job it could be my business it could be any part and Satan is in every part of it. He's the God of this evil age. &gt;&gt; And as being God of this evil age, he wants to he wants the the bowing. He wants to be uh have obesence. He wants to be served. &gt;&gt; And that's that's exactly the direction that it takes. But with this I close in Daniel's day. They raised up an image and it was a forced worship. It was a forced worship. This is not easy for me to say, but brother Brandon talks about it being a force to worship in the end time. And what they this this image that they raised up actually image to Daniel raised him up said everybody's got to worship this. That same spirit, that's the spirit that's in the land today. &gt;&gt; That's the spirit the Bible says. In fact, as it finally concludes, you I want want you to think about this very deeply. The Bible finally concludes that there's an image to the beast that is raised up &gt;&gt; in the book of Revelation. And the Bible says, "All whose names are not in the book, worship the beast." &gt;&gt; All whose names are not in the book of life of the lamb, worship the beast. Listen friends, this whole thing is not about buying homes and you know having a job and buying a car and going place. This whole thing, the whole thing is about worship. &gt;&gt; What you're going to bow to, what you're going to serve, that's what it's all about. &gt;&gt; And you want to go out these doors today and say, I serve Christ. I serve this word. I bow to this word. I bow to the Christ who gave this word. Friends, I'm giving obedience. And I am not ashamed here to say I bow to that that uh prophetic word that came that could say stand up Mrs. Hoist &gt;&gt; you're healed Mr. caught &gt;&gt; that wisdom. &gt;&gt; That's the God &gt;&gt; that this man serves. &gt;&gt; That God who's of the supernatural, that God that is of a of a divine power. &gt;&gt; That's the God that wrote this book. &gt;&gt; And that's what we serve. &gt;&gt; I bow to that. I give reverence to it. But Satan will want he wants to permeate in such a form till a person doesn't think that they are being forced to to bow. But there are so many demands and pressures that come upon us and we we we start first you just start caving into it you know and becoming weary with it and start just uh surrendering to it. I believe in this day and age, people have been preparing for all kinds of, you know, uh maybe uh tribulation or whatever more and storing up foods and all of this business. I don't think it's going to be that kind of thing at all. I think it's going to be a rip roaring global economy as it was in the days of Noah. They're going to buy and they're going to sell and they're going to build and they're going to plant and they're going to do all kinds of things. They're going to trade in huge economic blocks and the whole world and and as far as sexually is concerned, they're the whole world become polluted and contaminated and perverted. You know, they're making a great big thing. They arrested 17 terrorists in Toronto day before yesterday and they said that they got this this is the main this is the main news MSNBC news in the states that 17 terrorists are arrested in Canada. They said they have three tons three tons of of explosives which just can be gotten almost anywhere. It's just farm uh fertilizer. One ton blew up the Oklahoma building. One ton. This is three tons. And there's been a little bit of word that maybe They were trying to actually blow up. They think they might going to be blow up. I think that tallest tower was until they got one taller in Malaysia, but the CN Tower in Toronto. They said if they did that, they would have blown away thousands of lives, several thousands of lives. So, they're making a big issue out of it. I sit there and listen and everybody just googling, you know. I was I I got it on my computer and I didn't think it would even be reported in the States because, you know, it's a strictly a Canadian thing, but there was some US connection. But while I'm sitting there and I have just read because I've been studying this message, I've just read, friends, that AIDS, there's 65 million &gt;&gt; people in the earth with AIDS. 25 million have already died &gt;&gt; and they're talking about 3,000 people &gt;&gt; and they got the whole world all captivated. These guys got three tons of, you know, fertilizer and all the rest of it and they're going to blow up something. Sure, fine. That's tragic. What about this other thing? &gt;&gt; And you have to search to find it. Right. &gt;&gt; And they get to some countries one in four and next country one in five. And it and it's just it it's and then they talk about we found a duck that's got the aven flu up in Mongolia. &gt;&gt; And we got they killed that duck. &gt;&gt; Come on folks. I'm not being I'm not mocking, but yet I am feeling a little bit like Elijah &gt;&gt; serving all these gods. &gt;&gt; That's where your false gods have taken you. We're living in Sodom &gt;&gt; and they're having their gay parade in in Israel. &gt;&gt; Why don't they trace it down? because it's the spirit of the very god of this evil age and he's not going to attack that &gt;&gt; and he's got the people all captivated on all these other things and all these other issues and making them so that he himself &gt;&gt; remains remains secluded. He remains guarded from it and we're in contact with it every day &gt;&gt; and would impose that upon you. I know you're a little bit quiet, but that's the world that you live in. But you are not of this world. I will repeat the words of Jesus. You're not of this world. &gt;&gt; You're in the world, but you're not of the world. These things are of the world, but we're not of the world. And I I want to thank God only by his grace that we're not of the world, but we're in the world. We're we're you know we're talking about they're talking about pandemics &gt;&gt; and and and inoculating everybody. I tell you what, friends. &gt;&gt; I may go off the same but you mark my word. There's no solution. &gt;&gt; There's no solution &gt;&gt; for the corruption &gt;&gt; that has been that has been in initiated in this age because that's the way it's going to go. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you want to thank God, you've got an exit out of here. &gt;&gt; You got a way out of here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let it sink in &gt;&gt; and say, "I thank God I'm not part of it." &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; you're the one, &gt;&gt; the glorious one that has made a way of escape for your people. And today Lord I am rejoicing and bringing across to these people the words that you spoke Lord Jesus and telling your disciples in that great prayer uh in John 17 that they were in the world but they are not of the world. We have not come as being part of the world but Lord Jesus we are separated from it. And I pray that the Holy Spirit with just a divine inspiration will permeate every person. There are those here perhaps need to be filled with the Holy Ghost. Lord, we need that kind of wisdom. We need that kind of discernment. And I pray that you will grant it. Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ, take these words. I pray that you will instill it deep in the hearts of the people. And Lord, I pray that that they will never be ashamed of your word. We're going to stand by it. But Lord, with Jesus, we want to express it. We want to live it out. And I pray, Father, that the word will be indelibly marked in the hearts of the people. And that you'll take the service tonight, oh God, and bless the people as they come from service to service. And as we move onward and upward in the name of Jesus Christ, I ask it. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; While I was studying, guess getting ready to come to the pulpit, you can you can well imagine I just thought, "Thank God, this world's not my home. &gt;&gt; I'm just &gt;&gt; passing through. &gt;&gt; My treasures are laid up &gt;&gt; somewhere beyond the blue." See, you know, we sit here in the congregation. Are we getting ready to sing that, please? We sit here in the congregation and I don't know if you realize it but you're protected people. Those that have to get out and I travel to a lot of countries and what I'm speaking about I've been in contact with. I've been I've been in countries that have been incredibly plagued. Used to be plagued by poverty and that is sad in itself. but plagued with the sin that the world is sinking in. If it weren't for the promise of God, friend, I don't even know where I would be. Knowing what we know and the reality of it, all I can say, I thank God more today for Calvary &gt;&gt; and for the power of the blood of Jesus Christ, for the protection of it. You've been a protected people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You want to rejoice over it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we stand? This world is not my home. I'm just a passing through. My treasures are made up somewhere beyond the moon. Angel [Music] heaven's open door and I can't feel at all in this world anymore. I have no friend like you. And if heaven's not my home, then Lord, what would I do? The angels back at me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. They're all expecting me. And that's one thing I know. I fixed it up with Jesus many years ago. [Music] Though I am weak and poor and I can't feel at all in this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. And if heaven's not my home, then Lord, what would I do? The angels fashion me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Just over in the glory land. We'll live eternally. [Music] Yeah. Sh. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. And if heaven's not my home, then Lord, what would I do? The angels fashion me from heaven's open door and I can't feel at home in this world anymore. We're only we're only going to walk through here once. You won't live yesterday again. This day has gone thus far. as your brother, as your friend, as your pastor, I want to re-emphasize and say, live every day for him. You will never regret it. &gt;&gt; And when we reach the other shore, we're going to shake hands. We're going to embrace one another &gt;&gt; literally. You'll have a body. You have it now. You've never seen it, but looks like you in your perfect health and life stream. And you have it and God designed it. You're going to live in it &gt;&gt; like you're living in this one. &gt;&gt; But we only have this moment to go through. For some of us might be long life. Some of us might be shorter life. Live it, my brother, my sister, with all the fervor and all the zeal &gt;&gt; that you can. &gt;&gt; Don't let the enemy wear you down. As a prophet would say so often, don't be weary. &gt;&gt; Don't be weary. Live it with everything that you have. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You even if you'll just say, "Lord, let the let the very fervor or the burden of your word that my brother Ed is feeling right now, let it come into me &gt;&gt; and let it possess me. Let it permeate me." &gt;&gt; Because I'm praying for that. I'm praying that every man and woman and every young person here become an absolute fire brand for God in whatever area you are in. You're going to touch somebody that I can't touch. You're going to influence them. They're not going to be in the church. They're going to hear your life preaching. May your life preach a mighty sermon is my prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'd like to sing. Linda then sings my soul, my savior God to thee. The the chorus, please. Then sings, "My soul, my savior comes to thee. How great th How great thy [Music] soul come to thee. How great thou are. How great God just once again my soul my savior God [Music] how great [Music] how great oh Oh my soul, my savior. [Music] How great thou art. How great th How great thou are. How great. [Music] We glorify you, Lord. &gt;&gt; With those words on your lips, we dismiss you in the name of Jesus Christ. with the blessings of God. May you go from this place as sons and daughters that have come from another land and are on their way back to that land. &gt;&gt; We're just journeying here for a short moment. And we have others who've already crossed over. We're going to meet them. This isn't a fairy tale. It's not something we just have to keep thinking about. It is the reality. That's the real place and that's where we're going. And that's why you were here this morning is to get ready for it. Greet one another. Would you God bless you? You're dismissed in Jesus name. [Music] God bless you, brother Vile. Heat. Heat. N. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Halleluah. Hallelujah. [Music]
