Brother Darren Hoffman, why don't you come and open the service in a word of prayer, take the needs of the congregation before the Lord as we pray together. We want to remember brother Ernie Villa this evening as he's not able to be with us as a ear infection at home. Also want to remember Jonathan Anthony and Nicole Frey at home not feeling well in body. Amen. Want to lift up the Frey family. We know they give so much of their time and their energy here at the school. It's a blessing to see each one that has been so faithful in contributing and those that are able to even give a little of their time. It means a lot and it goes a long ways. We want to appreciate you this evening as well. Brother Darren, man, if you have a need upon your heart this evening or just in this atmosphere, just say, "Lord, speak to me." Whatever you'd have on the servant's heart tonight, our pastor is going to come in a few moments. Deliver what the Lord has laid on his heart, but it takes us to hear to receive it and take God at his word. Amen. Will you pull on the gift of God tonight? Amen. Brother Darren, [Music] let's bow our heads. [Music] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful, Lord, that we can come into your presence tonight, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. So thankful that we are your children, &gt;&gt; that we've been birthed by the spirit of truth, &gt;&gt; Lord God. We're so thankful, Lord Jesus, that all around us is gross darkness, but yet you've given us light. Father, you've put a difference between us and the and the people and the things of this world. You've put a mark upon us, Father. You've given us your Holy Spirit. You've given us life and life more abundantly. Father, that we can live above all the cares of this world. We can live above all the the trials, Lord, the temptations, the persecutions, Lord, the sicknesses that come upon us. Father, you've given us your word, Father. A word that cannot fail. But you said you'd be with us and even in us to the end of the world. Father, all these precious promises you've given us, Lord, it encourages us. Father, I'm thankful for the word that even encouraged me today, Lord. Just going through a trial and you just whispered, "It's just a trial." And I was just rejoicing, dear God. Lord Jesus, you're mindful of us, Lord God. No matter what we're going through, you're there to give us strength, Lord God. You're there to touch our bodies when we're feeling weak. Dear God, you're there to forgive us when we do wrong, Lord. The blood is still flowing tonight, Lord Jesus. And I pray, Father God, that you just forgive us of all of our sin, all of our iniquities, Lord, that it all be under the blood, all cast into the sea of your forgetfulness, Lord Jesus, that nothing would hinder us, Lord. Not even Satan would be able to stand before us this night, dear God, as the word of God is ministered to us, Lord. Whether we're here, Lord, whether we're at home not feeling well as our brother Ernie with his ear infection, Lord. Father, raise him up. We pray, dear God. Lord Jesus, we pray that you'll take, Lord Jesus, the fray children, Lord, they're not feeling well. Raise them up, Father. It's your word, Lord Jesus. You've already spoken. By your stripes, they're already healed. Father, we're claiming it, Lord Jesus. We're combining our faith with theirs, Lord. Oh, Lord Jesus. We thank you for these promises, Lord, and we're walking in them, Father. This is our inheritance. This is a portion, Lord, the allotment that you've given us in this hour, and we've received it, Lord Jesus. We're walking in it, Lord God, and we're we're manifesting it, Lord. We give you the glory, dear God. We give you the praise for you're still working on us, Father. There's still a work for us to do in this world, Lord Jesus. Help us to be faithful, Lord. Help us to press in, dear God, to catch that Holy Ghost burden, dear Lord Jesus, to reach out to that last soul, dear God, to reach out to our loved ones, to our children, Lord, to those that are walking in darkness, dear God, that they would see the great light of Jesus Christ in our lives. That light would attract them, Father. That you would woo them to yourself, Lord, just as you've done us, Lord. How we rejoice, Lord God. We rejoice that we can be a part of this great calling, this great plan of redemption. How it humbles us, Lord. We're nothing, dear God, without you. But you've elevated us, Lord Jesus, to your right hand. You've elevated us to the throne of God. We've ele you've elevated us, Father God, to your side. And Lord Jesus, we just want to sit at your side tonight. Sit at your feet, Lord Jesus, as you would speak through our pastor. &gt;&gt; Lord God, you've prepared a word for him, Lord. A word in due season. And Lord Jesus, I'm here to receive what you have for us tonight. Lord Jesus, we're putting in our order in. Even if we have it, Lord, we can put our order in right now. That you'll do great and wondrous things in our midst tonight, Lord Jesus. That lives would be touched, Lord. Lives would be set on fire. That people would be filled with the Holy Ghost, Lord Jesus, that people would be saved. People would be healed, Lord God. That many mighty miracles, oh God, would be performed, Lord God, in our midst. For you said signs and wonders would follow them that believe. We're believing tonight, Lord. We're accepting the word. We're believers, dear God. We're expecting, Lord Jesus, for you to move on the scene this this night, Lord. Oh, God. We're believers, Lord. Let our faith, Lord God, just be united tonight, Lord, for those that maybe feel tired, downtrodden, Lord. We're here to encourage them, Father. We're here to lift them up, oh God. We're a we're a body ministry, Lord Jesus, ministering to each one. So God, we're just waiting upon you, Lord. Send the fire, Father. Fall fresh on us tonight, Lord Jesus. We're waiting in anticipation, Father, for what you've laid upon our pastor's heart. No doubt it's something that we have need of even tonight. Something, Lord Jesus, that will give us strength, that will give us courage, that will give us that ability, Father, just to press on, Lord God, more so than ever before. &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We so love you. What love is this, Lord Jesus, that would save sinners such as us, Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank you for the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you for your mercies that are new every morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, your mercies will never fail us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Your mercies are from everlasting to everlasting. &gt;&gt; So be with us, Father, as we wait upon you, Lord. as we worship you, as we praise you, we pray you'll anoint our brother Derek. Father, just to help us to get into that channel, Lord, anoint the musicians, Lord, as they're doing their part. And oh, God, most of all, speak to us, Father. &gt;&gt; Anoint the man of God who has waited upon you. We so appreciate the gift in our pastor. Lord, it's it's a gift that we've not overlooked, but we know, Lord Jesus, we hold it in high regard for that's the office of a pastor. Lord, the head of the local body. We just want to give due respect, Lord God, to the man of God as he's waiting upon you, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, to be respectful and to be attentive, Lord, to hear the word of God, Lord Jesus, to hear it, to recognize it, and then to act upon it. &gt;&gt; So here, Lord Jesus, we're reporting for duty tonight, &gt;&gt; praying, Father God, that you would have your way in each and every one of us. In the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we commit all things to your to you in your hands, Father. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Stand and sing one more chorus with me. [Music] Thanks. Thanks. I give you thanks for all you've done. I am so blessed. My soul has Lord I give you thanks. We say thanks Lord. [Music] [Applause] I give you thank you. [Music] I am so blessed. My soul is I give you praise. We say thanks Lord. [Applause] I give you for all you. I am so blessed. My soul is [Music] I give you thanks. Amen. You have may have your seats this evening. Amen. It's good to see everyone. As we invite our pastor to come minister the word to us this evening. We want to greet each and everyone. Those that are visiting with us. I don't see brother Joe Perisok, but I believe he's brother Joe. God bless you. Why don't you stand and wave your hand? You're not a strange in our midst. From Edmonton, God bless you and your wife. Good to have you here this evening. Amen. Praise the Lord. Your sons are very gifted and talented and we've been blessed by them. Amen. Was able to spend some time with one of your sons up in Grand Prairie a week or so ago and we may be learning a couple of songs that they sing. So I think they take them for granted, but I picked some fruit. It was ripe. They're good songs. So maybe I'll get Brother Ryan to teach them to us because I'm not much of a song teacher. We have gifts in the body that we can pull on. Amen. Why don't we sing together? Lord, I lift your name, your holy name. As we invite brother Biscll to come this evening. Lord, I lift your name. Your holy name. It's your [Music] God. [Music] [Applause] You're my [Music] king. [Music] might [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the [Applause] [Music] Let's all sing this together as we sing it once again. Your life your name your name. [Music] You're a great I am. Yes. [Music] I [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; How wonderful to be gathered &gt;&gt; around his word. Amen. Good to be in the house of God. &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be in the land of the living and be here &gt;&gt; so we can worship together, &gt;&gt; read together. &gt;&gt; Infallible word of God. &gt;&gt; Just wonderful. &gt;&gt; The service tonight uh will be probably kind of a leadin to Sunday morning. So, uh those that are not here, I hope they will get to perhaps stream it ahead of time. And uh those of you that are here, you might want to just make special note of some of the scriptures in the direction that we're in and it'll help you on Sunday morning. I also want to mention to you that we are preparing and there have been preparations being made for uh M Murphy'sboro convention which is on the 4th, 5th and 6th of November. And uh pastor Joseph Hammed there has just had this very very much on his heart for a number of years. And now I think this is the third year that we're having the convention there. He he's really burdened for we say missions but it is to get the word out to the people and that is our our burden. And so he came here and he's w kind of watched the work over the years and he just said he wants to be uh uh like a a a station down there in the south and the southeast. So we we're thankful for that. We're thankful for the opportunity and uh this week in fact is I believe tomorrow the uh missions faith challenge report is going to be off. So, you'll be able to get your copies on Sunday. And I would appeal to you once again, young and old. You have a friend. Everybody's got a friend, a few friends. Even if you have an enemy, send one to them. And uh that would be very scriptural. Uh and it'll do them good. It'll really do them good whether they're close or far. So, we'd appreciate that. We appreciate your prayers for these meetings. Also the very following weekend, November 11th, 12th, and 13th, uh we are to be with brother David McGuri in Dallas, Fort Worth. And the Lord certainly did some supernatural things the last time we were there, and he just wanted to have the meeting again this year. I would request that you also pray for Brother Ivan. He's uh in China and I just got we've gotten several emails, but I just got uh one that I believe this morning and uh they he gave a number of gave some pictures perhaps we'll be able to show you on Sunday, but there's two sisters uh and a and a young girl working and then with them is uh two another couple of volunteers that come in and give their time. He said they work generally at least 10 hours a day. They are there there is orders coming in. People are calling in, writing in, texting, whatever for the message books because they realize now since the hub more people are learning that there's message messages that are available in the Chinese and English and Vietnamese on the hub and they're ordering individual ones. They're doing between two and 400 a day. Isn't that incredible? And sending them all over China as far as Japan and Australia on the other side. And I I just say God bless them. &gt;&gt; So on your behalf, I I just went forward and they needed another printer, commercial printer. They're similar to the ones we have for the hub here, only they buy them over there. So, we sent them $2,000 from your missions giving so they could uh uh continue this work. I mean, you know, these people are for the most part really quite poor. They were they said, "Well, we'll do it on our own." And I just I knew that's too great a burden. So, we shared with it. Furthermore, I think it's a blessing for us to know that perhaps we provided that someone you've read a book recently. You heard a message recently and you were blessed. Some of these are seeing it for the first time. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, that's a real joy. Brother Murphy, of course, just left. Just arrived last Saturday and uh there was many churches and pastors and of course they wanted him to stay. uh we needed him here and uh so let's remember those that he just left. Also on Friday night of the prayer service and brother Kyle is back from uh hunting trip with brother Dave and and brother Jose and brother uh let's see brother Blake How and Sam and I were along just for the ride. But anyway, uh the other brothers did a lot of the work and but we're having the prayer service on Friday night and I know that it's also been mentioned the the workers at the school. I I've been so encouraged to see people coming there almost every day and I know we're winding up and we just have little work to do. So God bless the people. It it won't be in vain. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll have you turn in your Bibles to Amos the 8th chapter. And Amos is just after Joel. No, I'll preach if you pull. &gt;&gt; Amen. I told Brother John if he can't pull to push. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to start reading at the 11th verse. But just before we read, let's let's pray once more. Blessed, lovely Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; What a privilege it is, what an honor it is for us to call you our Lord, our Savior. &gt;&gt; Oh God, our Lord and our God. My Lord Jesus, it is in your name. If that had not been given and uh and granted to us, we wouldn't have this approach to the almighty God. And we just give you honor and praise, oh Lord. You're the holy one of Israel. &gt;&gt; You're the holy one that Abraham worshiped, Isaac and Jacob worshiped. And the prophets were moved by the Holy Spirit, your spirit. and they they pen down these words, some that we will read tonight. I pray that you'll give us insight. &gt;&gt; Give us enlightenment, oh God. Give us faith as we hear the word. I pray, Father, you'll bless your people immensely. Anoint us, oh God. Anoint me as I standing here at the post of duty to speak. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. And all the people could say, "Amen." Amen. Reading now Amos 8 and 11. Behold, the days come, sayaeth the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land. Notice who's sending it. I will send a famine in the land. Not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east. and they shall run to and fro uh to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it. &gt;&gt; In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst. And now I'm just reading this verse. You can listen. Job 42 and5. I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you as you have your seats. You'll have to kind of release the boundaries of your mind tonight as we uh think of this and speak about this subject because I found uh as I studied and I've been pondering this for some time uh hearing is not a very easy subject to define and brother brother Darren in his prayer actually quoted the title that I had to this message until I I felt I would just change it to call it something else because brother Brandham preached the message hearing recognizing and acting &gt;&gt; and brother Darren used those exact words as he was coming towards the end of his prayer which was really a kind confirmation to myself said to hear and to recognize and to act upon the word but I I want to uh entitle this predestinated to hear the voice and the subject is going to kind of get off in some distant places. But I think we need that to realize uh that the hearing is not just with the faculty of our eardrum and our what what we process in our mind and the thoughts that we get. I'll speak certain words tonight, but all of you people, you're not going to process the thoughts exactly the same. It's not going to mean I may make a statement and it'll mean one thing to one sister, another thing to another brother over there, and something entirely different to someone over here because our minds just go in those directions. But God knows exactly what you need. &gt;&gt; He knows just what each one of us needs. And so when I thought about this hearing uh and I thought about what the Bible has to say and the Bible has much much to say about hearing. For example, uh the the scriptures begin with the words in Genesis 1 and3 because there's nothing to hear unless somebody speaks. And so we we we're starting right early in the Bible with the with the words to give us a a beginning this evening. But the ability the ability to hear and to respond to the call of God goes far beyond the faculties as I said a moment ago of the physical hearing or the emotional attachment because people can you know they hear something but inside inwardly they have a much stronger uh uh feeling about something because even the words will inspire something within. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; that's why they say when, you know, when we speak to one another or be kind to one another or whatever we say to one another, it it can have it will have an effect, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Uh on the individual. That's why we say to people, God bless you. Because that should have an effect on the people. Uh uh someone says to a member of their family, I love you. it has an effect. Uh we're glad that we hear those words &gt;&gt; and we appreciate that. Now, uh, just just so you ponder these things as we start out, I want to read this because I I I spend a lot of time on a short phrase, but if the entire bride body of Jesus Christ suddenly and instantly experienced a complete cleansing of every connection and attachment to their place of fellowship. Now they can't change their place of residence but their place of fellowship and who they fellowship with. Uh every connection and attachment outside of the voice of God through the chosen vessels that God has ordained. I'm quite certain that there would be a massive movement and readjustment within that body of Christ. &gt;&gt; In other words, they say, "Well, what are you saying, brother Biscell? I'm saying that a lot of people are perhaps within the ranks of the message because they someone else that they're close to is there &gt;&gt; or someone my friends are there &gt;&gt; or my family is there and that has nothing to do with it. It is that every person needs to be where you're seated tonight because you've heard the voice of God. &gt;&gt; You heard a personal call &gt;&gt; to your own soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. and something happened within. In other words, you heard with an inner voice. &gt;&gt; You heard something from within. &gt;&gt; It isn't something that moved you and attached you emotionally &gt;&gt; or physically in any special way, but it is that you had a an experience with the voice of God. &gt;&gt; God spoke, &gt;&gt; God called and you responded. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now for example the basis of fellowship as in John 1 and 1 John 1 and7. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light if if if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another. That's really the only basis of fellowship. If we walk in the light as he is in light and the conjunction word, the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sins. That happens to be a very powerful scripture. &gt;&gt; If we walk in the light as he is in the light, then we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin. So that's just an example of what I'm speaking of as the basis for fellowship. family or friends may play a big part and it should. Some of the disciples were brothers &gt;&gt; and brother Bram speaks about their father speaking to them about the Messiah that would come and then the Messiah came in their time in their age and called them and that's the grace of God upon that family. And we have it right here. And I'm thankful for the grace of God upon our families. And you that are here with your families and those of you that are here that h are younger and perhaps don't have families yet. You're part of a family. You want to thank God for the family you're a part of. You want to thank God that God ever breathed upon the soul and spoke to your father, your mother, or whoever else. and uh and so our our talents and our position in life uh should have a positive effect upon our uh our contribution to the body of Jesus Christ, but it is not the basis of fellowship. So we're thankful for every talent and every skill and every person, every willing worker uh whether whether you're highly visible or not, that doesn't make any difference. Uh it is according to the scripture it is the it is the one that's almost invisible the lowly ones that would be in a congregation that must be esteemed because we do not know how to value things the way God values it. It's not, you know, just from the ministry or the pastor or or those that are so visible, but it is every member of the body of Christ is to be highly esteemed &gt;&gt; and we have fellowship. So now I start out by saying a scripture that you all know very very well. Third verse in the Bible says, "And God said, &gt;&gt; "Let there be lights." &gt;&gt; And there was light. &gt;&gt; So God said, you've heard me speaking it here before because I don't want you to think I'm on one track, but I don't know what language he used. I don't know if there is a language. I don't know if there is an audible sound. But he spoke to the elements. He spoke to his creation. And his creation in whatever form it was responded positively. Let there be light. &gt;&gt; And there was light. &gt;&gt; Something heard it. &gt;&gt; Something adjusted. Something moved. Something blew into a flaming fire and gave light. &gt;&gt; And we had a greater light to rule the day and a lesser light to rule the night. And the the word that is is used in Hebrew for said, it is to speak or to utter, but it goes beyond that. It is to say in one's heart. So God could have just desired it. &gt;&gt; God could have or that word also is to think &gt;&gt; or to command. So God could have had it in his mind &gt;&gt; and just focus his thoughts and said, "I want a light. &gt;&gt; I want a great light. That's what I desire." He's the creator. He didn't have to have a language. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He could think it. He could command it. Or it is also to promise. And God said it is to make a promise. I'm going to have a light. I don't whether it took a hundred million years. It's that's irrelevant. &gt;&gt; God desired it. God thought about it. God intended it and God said it and it happened. &gt;&gt; God spoke to the heavens. God spoke to the waters. God spoke to the earth and to man and in each case said very specific things. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. And God said, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters." And it did. And God said, "Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so. &gt;&gt; And the God said, "Let the earth." Here's God speaking. &gt;&gt; He's talking to the earth. &gt;&gt; He's talking to the heavens. &gt;&gt; He's talking to the planets. He's He's got intention for all of these things. &gt;&gt; He probably said at some point in time, "And don't get out of time &gt;&gt; because he's going to have a prophet come on down the road and tell us thousands of years later." They're they're so precise. They're just a uh absolutely to the second right on time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament." And there was. And God said, "Let the waters bring forth abundantly &gt;&gt; the moving creatures that hath life." And it did. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth." Now he's talking to the earth. "Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind." And then God said, "Let us make man in our image." And he did. The creator speaking to his creation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And whatever form that substance was in, be it liquid H2O or whether it was earth or whether it was air or whether it was planets, the creator &gt;&gt; in whatever form he spoke or desired it or commanded it or promised it or intended it that I want you to have a better understanding of the God we serve. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he is he's conscious of every thought we have &gt;&gt; and he just thought those things or intended those things or spoke those things. Anyway, the word is God said it and it happened. &gt;&gt; That's how he gives. Can there be a promise? Can there be any kind of a promise of God that could fail that kind of a God? &gt;&gt; I think that this surely ought to inspire faith into your hearts tonight. And God said, "And the creator speaking to his creation, &gt;&gt; the substance of creation heard him, &gt;&gt; and whatever form it was in, it heard him &gt;&gt; and responded accordingly. &gt;&gt; The waters brought forth." &gt;&gt; And it didn't bring forth just anything. It brought forth what he thought it should bring forth, &gt;&gt; and bring forth creatures. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The scripture says Psalms 33:6, "By the word of the Lord, were the heavens made and all the and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth." &gt;&gt; In Hebrews scripture, the prophet refers to often through faith. We understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were made of things which do not appear. The serpent &gt;&gt; was also part of this creation. &gt;&gt; But he crossed the boundaries. &gt;&gt; He crossed the boundaries of his created being. When he went to the woman, there's no place where there was ever any allowance for him, a creature like that, to come to a higher one and to speak. &gt;&gt; He crossed the boundaries. I want you to watch that very closely. You may say, "Well, where are you going, brother Bisc? Why are we speaking about these things?" Because when you find any spirit begins to manifest itself and wants to lift itself up, It's not coming from the right direction. &gt;&gt; Let every man abide in his own calling. &gt;&gt; When you find the people become lifted up, a person kind of becomes lifted up. &gt;&gt; I don't care what they're in, but they start to be lifted up within themselves, it's a wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the serpent was also part of the creation but he crossed these bounds when he spoke to the woman. He never heard his creator God give permission to speak to the woman. It's never there. Thou has been in Eden. The scripture says in Ezekiel, "Thou hast been in Eden, and every precious stone was thy covering. The sardest topaz, and the diamond, and the burl, and the onyx, and the jasper, and the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold. The workmanship of thy tabts, and of thy pipes, that is the joints, etc., was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created." He was a created being. But this created being also said uh prophet Isaiah speaking he said for thou hast said in thine heart God revealing what was in his heart I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will also sit in uh I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north and I will ascend above the heights of the clouds and I will be like the most high. So now you can see that Satan himself, Lucifer, who had been cast to the earth, is now taking and accessing humanity through the facility of the serpent. &gt;&gt; Satan cast out of heaven seeking to ascend because that's his whole theme. I will ascend. I will ascend. I will sit. I will do this. I will do that. Lifting himself up. That desire to lift himself above what God had given him, the position God had given him. And that's the origin of that that spirit. And he and and so whenever Satan takes control of a thing or a person, they begin to be lifted up from their calling or their position. So it says, "Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord had Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, now notice, he said unto the woman, ye hath God said, notice how subtle, perhaps you've never noticed this before. I begin to see some new things in it. You shall Did God say you shall not eat of every tree of the garden?" That's not what God said exactly. And the woman said unto the serpent, "You, we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden." God told him, "You can eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, but not this one of the tree of knowledge and and of good and knowledge." So he said, "Did you shall did God say you shall not eat of every tree of the garden?" He's identifying himself. &gt;&gt; You understand? He's identifying himself because he was the one that she was not to partake of. &gt;&gt; Now, so uh I I want you to notice first and now the serpent said and then the woman said, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, you shall not eat it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die." And the serpent said. So now we we start off and God said and God said and God said let there be lights and God said let there be a firmament and God said let the waters be divided and God said let the waters bring forth and God said let the let the earth bring forth and it did and it did and it did and now we have and the serpent was the most subtle and he said &gt;&gt; so now he is being like acting like God &gt;&gt; and then she said Adam he hasn't said anything yet? And and and the serpent said unto the unto the woman, and the woman said unto the serpent. So now they're also directing the conversation. You might, you know, just to give you a little breather here for a moment. You know, parents especially, they realize it and perhaps others you've had the experience, but you you're talking to somebody and they don't indicate any acknowledgment of what you said and you say, "Do you hear me? I'm talking to you." Oh, a few people have smiled. I know you've done it. I got a quote here where the prophet of God says, "Satan, I'm talking to you." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He's getting his attention. &gt;&gt; Then he tells them what he plans to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the serpent said, the serpent said, "And he was cast down to crawl upon his belly on the earth." One of the first signs that God had Moses do through Aaron, told Aaron, "Cast your rod down." And it became a serpent. Take it up again by the tail. And it became a rod again. And went before Pharaoh and said, "Cast your rod down." Pharaoh's magicians did with their enchantment the same thing. And Aaron's rod swallowed all of theirs up. Brother Brandham says, "You know what he did?" He says he took that rod with their serpents in it and went and did miracles. &gt;&gt; See, some of you need to read the message. It is there. I didn't dream that up. He did say that. &gt;&gt; Amen. But from that day, the tree of humanity began to wither until in the end time there would be a famine for hearing the word of God. &gt;&gt; So when the serpent started speaking, the devil has had a heyday ever since. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, what's all these gadgets about? &gt;&gt; What's all this telephone business? What's all this social network about? What's all this about in the end time? You think, hey, and not many years ago, they didn't have such a thing as a telephone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you that lived on the farm, or if you ever did live on the farm, they'd hook a wire with a tin can onto a onto a fence and could get get to hear a voice two, three miles away on on the barb wire. &gt;&gt; Did you know that? Anybody here ever know that? Oh, there you are. Oh, man. You're telling us where you're from, brother Derek. That is really in the sticks. But I I've done it. I've had the can up to my ear and, you know, yell something here and say, "What do you say? Sounds scratchy." It is scratchy, but it's better than walking three miles until the end time and there be a famine for hearing the words of God. That's right. &gt;&gt; In the message, the world is again falling apart. Brother Brandham said, "No wonder we're falling apart." &gt;&gt; There's nothing. He stops. The very thing that created the earth, the very thing that was put here for the earth to turn on, the very thing that systems and everything else was to revolve around this word that by God framed the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; No wonder it's falling apart again because the word of God there isn't the same availability. It's not being heard &gt;&gt; the same way. &gt;&gt; If God is silent, God can be silent. &gt;&gt; In the Bible, between Malachi and and Matthew, there was 400 years and it's commonly said 400 years of silence. &gt;&gt; There wasn't the words of God being spoken by the prophets of God. Malachi to to John the Baptist was a silent time. And there's been times when when God has been silent. He'll move in some great way and then he just lets it as it were coast and see and then men made denominations and they made all their systems and everything and God just pulled back from it. &gt;&gt; Let them do what they want. And brother Brandon keeps saying and then he pruned the branch. Pruned the branch. cut it off because it was no longer fruitful with his with his uh with his life and his fruit. So, uh and then in the message turning on the light, he said, "But God's going to have a bride tree." Because now I said this, it it withered. God's going to have a bride tree. And all that the cankerorm ate and the caterpillar said, "I will restore, sayeth the Lord." Mal Malachi 4 tells us we'd be brought back to the original faith like it was on the day of Pentecost, the faith of the fathers. So, we believe that it will come. I I believe it's time for it now. The limbs were withered and dried up and they'll be taking them from the tree so that the tree can bear itself right in the top of the tree, bear fruit. uh bear bear itself right in the top of the tree. In other words, reproduce itself right in the top of the tree. And you may wonder why brother Brandham is saying things uh saying it in this way. And and they're being pruned off. They're being trimmed off because at that time they were still uh his ministry and the ministry and the churches and denominations were very much still integrated. They were using him, using his name, having meetings, having conventions. But he could foresee that they were going to be pruned off &gt;&gt; and leave the bride tree. &gt;&gt; The bride tree hasn't got Christian Businessman Association branches &gt;&gt; and all kinds of denominational branches. But at that time, it still did. But he's saying that time has come. And that's why they were casting him out &gt;&gt; because God was pruning them off &gt;&gt; so that the bride tree which this word came to bring and restore back &gt;&gt; was coming into being. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; Okay. A famine of hearing the words of the Lord. Number one. Number one. Not only that many will not hear the word of God even though it was spoken. They won't hear the word of God. That's number one. For for example, because they obeyed not the voice. Second, this is 2 Kings 18 and 12. Because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord their God, but transgressed his covenant and all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded and would not hear them nor do them. So that's number one, the people won't do it. But number two is I've got several scriptures on that. But number two, the famine of the hearing of the words of God is because God has not dispensing with it. God hasn't got the a Luther or hasn't got a Wesley or hasn't got uh a prophet of God as we've had in this generation. And so the words of God are not. You want to be very, very thankful. We have such free access. &gt;&gt; And we don't just have access to the just to live by faith. &gt;&gt; And and a and a man who smoked a pipe and drank beer. &gt;&gt; That was Luther &gt;&gt; and hated the Jews. &gt;&gt; That was Luther's. I understand. I'm not his judge. But God used him. &gt;&gt; That was the light that he had. And God used him with a revelation, the just shall live by faith. And he was one of God's messengers for that age. &gt;&gt; I'm glad we're not just under that age because it wouldn't satisfy. That's why the brother Brandham also said that he said if I preached a denominational doctrine, it wouldn't mean anything to you. Aren't you glad about that? &gt;&gt; It wouldn't mean anything to you. And then he talks about this message. He said this message is not for them because it's too rich. &gt;&gt; It would make them sick. &gt;&gt; But now you have a different spiritual constitution. You were made to hear this kind of word. &gt;&gt; People hear these kind of things and it is far too strong for them. But when you hear it, that's why many come in even into this church, come here and listen to the word and hear the preaching says, "Wow, you know, whoa, that's intense. That is too strong for me." and they're and and they're out of here. &gt;&gt; But you sit here and you say, "Give me more. &gt;&gt; I want to hear that." &gt;&gt; Because you have that kind of you're predestinated &gt;&gt; to hear that voice. &gt;&gt; You're predestinated to hear what that voice said. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says in Zechariah 7:11, going back just to the first point, "And they refused to hearken. They pulled away the shoulder and stopped their ears that they should not hear. And in Acts 28 and 27, for the heart of this people is waxed gross and their eyes their ears are dull of hearing. Notice their hearts waxed gross first and their eyes their ears are dull of hearing. And that's why brother Brandham even speaks to the people. He said, "You've heard so much." But we don't want to just have heard so much. We want to digest what we hear. We want to assimilate it. We want it to become f some of the fabric of our being, our spiritual being. Not just come to church, young people, you put this on. This is a garment. This is something that is it's actual. It's reality. It's not just words that go in here and come out here or or just rotate around, grab it, you know, gyate around in your mind. That's not what it's for. It'll do something to you. These are not just a words out of a Bible school. his words out of a prophet's mouth that came from God, thus sayith the Lord. And and and if that word could say, "Let there be lights." And there was lights, he can say, "Let there be a son of God." And there will be a son of God. &gt;&gt; And if he can wait for millions of years for that, he can wait a few days for you. &gt;&gt; He's got faith in his word. &gt;&gt; He knows that thing that needs to be changed will be changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said it and he will have it. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to have that kind of that kind of God that created. He spoke to his creation. When he's speaking to you, you're part of his creation. The reason I started out the way I did is to let you know that it's not God's not speaking just uh on a on a verbal or an audible way to get into your eard drums and to get into your mind and to get down to your soul. He has another way. He can also speak directly to your soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; You begin to feel something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was just thinking, you know, here comes a vindicated prophet of God where pillar of fire has uh been pictured over him. Pillar fire between the people. I'm speaking through the pillar of fire. Yet in such simplicity, he goes out of a morning out of his hotel room to mail a postcard. &gt;&gt; Yes. And while he goes out to mail the postcard, he hears a he hears just something inside like a little voice like you've all heard it. &gt;&gt; Keep walking. &gt;&gt; Keep walking. &gt;&gt; Two words. Keep walking. &gt;&gt; So there's a big policeman there on the corner. So he goes he he related this to me also. He goes to a store window. They weren't open. They were kind of dark. And he just looked in the store window and he said, "Father, is that you? And God didn't give a great glorious vision and saw flashes of lightning and thunder. No, he just kept hearing that same thing inside. Keep walking. So he went to the edge of the sidewalk. Keep walking. So you just start across. Keep walking. Now isn't that profound? &gt;&gt; I just said to my wife driving here tonight, I said, you know, she says, "Well, the same thing happens to us." I said, "Yeah, but it's just not so fantastic, &gt;&gt; you know, when it happens to him." Then something outstanding happens. And uh and and then he ends up The end result of that is he keeps walking and there's a there's a colored woman waiting for him. She's all wet with dew from the night, leaning over the fence. &gt;&gt; Morning, Parson. &gt;&gt; He's already gone past her. Excuse me. H how do you know? Do you know me? No, sir. Said, I don't know you. But she knew he was coming. &gt;&gt; He said, you're supposed to have a a val briefcase. He said, I left it in the hotel. &gt;&gt; That's what I saw you carrying. &gt;&gt; I was back in the hotel. &gt;&gt; And then she's been praying for him. &gt;&gt; Do you ever hear me? My name's William Brandom. No, I never heard of you. &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible? &gt;&gt; Keep walking. Keep walking. and a and a boy gets saved, &gt;&gt; gets healed, &gt;&gt; and becomes, I believe, Sunday school teacher or something. We never know. &gt;&gt; You're waiting for some great enormous voice and maybe it's just something inside. &gt;&gt; I got up this last Saturday morning and I said, I didn't say anything. I just said and I kept pushing it out and I just had like a little voice you you know you should maybe go and pick up brother you know go and meet brother Murphy at the airport and I thought well I'd like to you know and I don't know if I can or not and then and then we had things to do and you know wife's got plans and I got plans and and and then I was always kind of edgy throughout the day in case something crowded that out and I thought well if it works out we'll go and uh but I kept trying to push things around and manipulate things so that I would be able to go. Finally, I said to her in the afternoon, I'd like to, you know, go to the airport and uh meet brother Murphy, you know, if we are able to do that. And well, I think Sister Tracy's going to pick him up. I said, "Oh, I know, but I I said I feel like I want to be there." So, anyway, we went early. We went a little bit early about 5 to plane wasn't coming in until 7:30. We said, "Well, he's got the customs. He's got the immigration baggage. Waiting for the baggage. He won't be out till 8:00." And so, uh, I just said, "No, I I really want to go." So, we got in a car and boom, away we went down the road. And we were there at about 20 after. It takes about 25 minutes from my house, just no traffic, no nothing. and and walked into the airport and I just walked in and my wife says, "Now we want to stand back." So we're I was looking for Sister Tracy. We want to stand back. Doesn't this sound profound? So we want to stand back. We want to see his wife hasn't seen him for two months. Want to let her be able to greet him. We don't want to be, you know, involved in that private moment. So we were kind of pulling back a wee bit and here come this brother walking up to me said you looking for a Chinese man. Brother Murphy, what are you doing here? This is only this is only 20 7. You're supposed to be back in there. The plane's not supposed to be here for we even called and they said the plane is due at 7:30. So he said we know they told us on the internet you're going to be here at 7:30. No, he says, "We got here at 5 to 7 and I was already through the immigration's nothing. I just, you know, I just waved my uh my passport and I was out of here at 10 after 7. He'd been there for 10 minutes." And I said, "Well, is Sister Tracy, is she here?" "No." He said, "She just left the house." He said, "I just phoned her. She just left the house." I said, "Well, call her. We'll take you." No, no, no. He said, "She's coming. she's coming. And I said, "Well, call her. Find out where she's at." So he called her just a couple minutes. "No, she just left the house. She's in Suriri." I said, "Well, just tell her to stay and we'll just take you." And Sister Tracy's house was full of people and everything and we got to have him in the car and I I just felt a great privilege. And you know what? It couldn't have been it couldn't have been better because if if you'd have tried to schedule everything, the schedule was God's schedule. And while it was happening, we realized, you know, this is God's schedule. &gt;&gt; And then we were able to, you know, take him home and meet the family and go in ourselves and have supper. Not because we wanted it. We were forced to eat. You know, you all know what that's like. All right. But, you know, it's just a little thing, but I really think God said, "My servant has been laboring all these weeks." I asked Brother Murphy, "How many messages did you preach?" He said, "I I don't know." He said, "Probably 30 in the last month." That's a lot of services. &gt;&gt; That's a lot of services. And God has always had, you know, he's had a special place. Someone that's been laboring and giving themselves. You know what he probably said? I'm I'm just going to arrange that, you know, Brother Ed and Sister Ruth just have nothing to do and they jump in their car and just whisk right off to the airport and pick my servant up. &gt;&gt; Well, anyway, I'll be like, "Brother Garald anyway." He He's blessed by it. I'm blessed by it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the famine comes not only will those not hear but those that would hear like the scripture says woe unto you lawyers for you have taken away the key of knowledge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You entered not in yourselves and them that were entering you hindered. &gt;&gt; That spirit is still here. &gt;&gt; Not in this church but it's here. There are those that will not enter. Ministry theologians won't enter and do everything in their power to see that you don't enter. &gt;&gt; How many have experienced that? &gt;&gt; There you are. Ken raised his hand. I remember when when he first came and he he didn't know a whole lot about the Bible, but it was arranged, I believe, by his parents that he would go and see a very very dignified white-haired old man. Doesn't mean that everybody's white-haired is dignified, but anyway. And uh he was a, you know, retired minister of the church where Ken went to and played the organ and so on. And uh so he knows that he's kind of got into a rad some radical stuff. Says now Cam, you know that we can't take the Bible literal. For example, it says that the prophet Elijah, Elisha, I don't remember which one, but he says for example, the prophet made the axe head float. Ken, we know that steel doesn't float. Ken had never heard that before. He didn't know, but all he knew is if the Bible said that, he believed it floated. &gt;&gt; So he said, "Well, one thing," he said, "Uh, if the Bible," he didn't know it was in the Bible, but he said, "If the Bible says that, I believe it. I believe it floated." &gt;&gt; And he said he doesn't even know how it happened, but he found himself out in the front porch. just happened that fast &gt;&gt; and he was already out the door. &gt;&gt; They have the key. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; that lots of these leaders knew the truth. &gt;&gt; That's why they kept having the prophet come because they knew they wanted the sign. They wanted the sign to happen, but they didn't want to hear the voice of the sign. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to come to that. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? in spiritual food and due season. He says, "Now, we all know, we're all very aware that there is a great spiritual drought in the land today." Doesn't say it was coming. This 65 and then it's in the land today. Speaking and you know that was predicted by the prophets just before the second coming of Jesus of the of the Christ would be there. He said, "There will come a famine in the land and it won't be for bread alone, but it'll be for hearing the word of God and that day is now. hearing the true word of God. Now this types the natural drought with the spiritual sin and unbelief by false teachers and modernists in the church had brought had brought the place to this coming oncoming judgment and then they had turned from God's word and his prophet to a modern theological terms of the word. Right. &gt;&gt; And he goes on in Amos 8:11 where we read where it is said that there would come a famine not for bread uh or water but for the hearing of the word of God and that people would go from sea to sea from east to west and and to and fro everywhere seeking to for the word of God and fail to find it. If that don't fit this nation at this time &gt;&gt; now he was saying that in ' 65. if that don't fit that nation at the time. Listen friends, we've had lots of bread, lots of water, a lot of those things, but there has been a drought and we're living in the midst of it. You talk about a spiritual drought. &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that? &gt;&gt; And he said there's we don't need bread. We got plenty of it. We got plenty to eat, plenty clothes to wear, nice homes to live in, and everything. But there's a famine for the hearing of the word of God. A man won't know what to believe. &gt;&gt; A man won't know. A person doesn't know what to believe. And that's created a famine because there's every kind of a doctrine, every kind of an idea, every kind of an opinion, &gt;&gt; every kind of a teaching, all kinds of preaching, every kind of if you want it glitzy or if you want it very stayed and stoic, however you want it. If you wanted an a man or if you want people climbing all over the place, however you want it, you can have it. But that created a famine because people didn't know what to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they didn't believe anything. &gt;&gt; So I'm confused. I don't know what to believe. &gt;&gt; And that created the famine. &gt;&gt; John 1 and1. And he came to his own. Follow me closely now. I'm going to just try and hold it right down. He came to his own and his own received him not. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But John 10 and 27 says, "My sheep &gt;&gt; hear my voice." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know them. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they follow me. &gt;&gt; That happens to be absolute. &gt;&gt; He came to his own. His own received him not. &gt;&gt; But in the same book by the same writer, he he speaks my sheep. These are his own words. My sheep know my voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And conjunction word, they I know them. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? It isn't just you have to know him, but he knows you. &gt;&gt; And they follow me. &gt;&gt; Not the preaching only, but they follow me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The voice of the sign. Now in the in the scripture the voice that refers to the voice of the sign in the Old Testament which God spoke to Moses in Exodus that voice that voice the word there is actually a thunder or thunderings or it's used also for proclamation something but almost always it is the voice throughout the Old Testament but it when you when you have the uh uh when you have the thought that it is a a thunder. Uh it's thunderings. It's a proclamation. It's a powerful statement. And it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee. &gt;&gt; If you will, if they will not believe you, Moses, &gt;&gt; you're the one that's speaking. &gt;&gt; They hear your vocal cords, but they won't believe that. Right? &gt;&gt; He said, "And if they won't believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, &gt;&gt; they will believe the voice of the latter sign &gt;&gt; because God was going to uh keep enforcing it and intensifying it until they would have to believe it &gt;&gt; and believe it so much they'd ask him to go." &gt;&gt; But it literally thundered to them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the opening of the seals was in seven thunders. that voice they so that you understand even people got caught up in it and so on and so forth and maybe uh uh maybe turned others so they became uh afraid to speak about it. I'm not afraid to speak about anything he spoke about. He said the seven thunders are the seven voices under those seven seals. &gt;&gt; And he said if you go to the symbol in John's gospel they they heard the people heard a thunder, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But he heard something else. &gt;&gt; That's right. He heard, "This is my son, &gt;&gt; my beloved son." &gt;&gt; He heard specific words that were articulated to him. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul, the men fell to the ground because they they saw the great light. But not only did he see a great light and they heard a voice and one place that said they didn't hear the voice. What they didn't hear, they didn't hear the voice articulating the words saying something. They heard a sound, but they did not hear Saul. Saul, why persecutest thou me? That was the message from the Lord Jesus to him. Maybe you're sitting beside somebody or someone else in your family or some friend when God spoke to you and smoked you with conviction. &gt;&gt; They weren't convicted. They don't know what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know two young men in Singapore and the one and one was invited to go to see the film Deep Calls to the Deep &gt;&gt; and and he's in the army. He didn't want to go alone. He's kind of afraid, you know, and he knew that they were trying to convert him. And so he says to his buddy, "Hey, I I got to go and see this film. Will you go with me?" Yeah, okay, fine. I I'm free. I'm all right. So away they both go and they're both watching at this in Singapore. And the guy who just got invited, he was the one who became a believer. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he heard a voice &gt;&gt; articulating to him, "This is for you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the voice of the sign and this there there is there is obviously a sound of greater intensity reaching to the parts of our being not connected to the physical hearing. &gt;&gt; If they will not believe thee, they'll not believe your voice. They will believe the voice of the latter sign. The Bible says in Moses and Aaron they went in before Pharaoh and I mentioned earlier they cast the rod down and before Pharaoh and his servants and it it became a serpent and then they took it up the rather their their enchantments and their magicians sent theirs down and so on. But now I want to go on quickly. Says in Matthew, "For this is he, for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, the voice of one crying in the wilderness." The voice of one crying. Please interpret that for me. The voice of one crying in the wilderness. Was was was John out in the wilderness just crying out and creaming out or was it referring to his preaching or what was it referring to? Well, the Bible says the Bible says that the people were they were drawn they multitudes came to John came to his baptism. Baptism isn't a custom in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; They didn't do baptism. Nobody was immersing people in in Jordan. But John, he's out there doing some. It wasn't just because it was some kind of a circus or some kind of a demonstration. Well, he's putting people in the water. Let's go and see. No, there was something he was there was a voice &gt;&gt; of one crying in the wilderness &gt;&gt; and the people were drawn to this to this man to this ministry. There was something that was uh special about him and perhaps they couldn't even explain it. &gt;&gt; But to many of them there was no articulation of the word. Many came and were baptized. Many did not come. &gt;&gt; You might wonder where I'm going and that's fine. That's fine. But I hope it makes enough sense to you. So we just carry on. And so the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepared the way. And then Jesus came on the scene immediately following that. And John introduced him. And and Jesus said to the disciples, he said to two, and the Bible says this, and Jesus, now get the scene, please. Now, in this generation, a man, William Brandam, is walking out in the sidewalk says, "Follow me. Follow me." You know, you know, just keep walking, keep walking, keep walking. 2,000 years ago, a man was just walking. A man was just walking along the seashore and there's two fishermen and the Bible says they were casting their net into the sea. Now, that's not profound. That's not startling. And the man is walking. This man is called Jesus of Nazareth. And he sees two brethren, two brothers, Simon, called Peter and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea, &gt;&gt; for they were fishers. And he saith unto them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men." and they straightway or immediately they immediately left their net &gt;&gt; and followed him. &gt;&gt; It wasn't just the audible words, come and follow me &gt;&gt; and I'll make you fishers of men. &gt;&gt; I am absolutely am convinced there was something that was deep within &gt;&gt; calling for something and they somehow that it made a connection. &gt;&gt; This is the time. This is what I've looked for. &gt;&gt; There's just something about this moment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Friends, &gt;&gt; you had that. &gt;&gt; We all had that. We became a believer. It became our moment. &gt;&gt; It was the It was the transforming moment. It was the defining moment of our lives. Everything changed from that day forward. Is that not so? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This one, there was something. Now, now you'll know why I read earlier out of Genesis, starting at the beginning of Genesis. It was the creator. &gt;&gt; I'll say it again. It was the creator. &gt;&gt; For all things were made with by him and without him was nothing made that is made. &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; was in Christ. &gt;&gt; God who said, "Let there be light." And there was. God who spoke to the waters. God who spoke to the to the air to the planets. God who spoke to the earth. God was now speaking to the earth in another form. &gt;&gt; Men, &gt;&gt; fishermen. &gt;&gt; God speaking, the creator speaking to his creation. &gt;&gt; Come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come follow me. &gt;&gt; I'll make you fishers of men. And that and that earth which was part of its creation could do nothing different than it did in the beginning. It had to respond &gt;&gt; and it had to respond immediately &gt;&gt; because he was there. He was moving and they left their net, &gt;&gt; left their father. Others left their father and went immediately and followed him. [Music] &gt;&gt; What do you think about it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever form it was in, doesn't matter whether it was Peter or Andrew or Ed Biscll or you &gt;&gt; when God spoke &gt;&gt; and he's the one who said you're going to come. &gt;&gt; I'm the creator &gt;&gt; and you're a part of this earth &gt;&gt; and I'm calling for you to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. So many things he said so many things. There are so many things in the message. Hear his voice. So many things to dull the senses of the people today. &gt;&gt; So I want you to think about our environment now for a moment because I am convinced that God speaks perhaps more than we're able to hear. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there are things that can dull our hearing. &gt;&gt; And he said that it dulls the senses of the people today. Oh, but in the midst of all that, in spite of everything dulling in every voice that's in the world today, some of them are pleasure voices, some of them are sinful voices to lure the people. But in the spite, and I want you to get this, in the spite, in spite of every bit of that, the truth of God still remains. &gt;&gt; He that will hear my voice and come after me. Men and women who will hear the voice of God, God still waits to speak to every individual that'll open their ears to hear God's voice. And Jesus said, "Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice." &gt;&gt; There can't be a single one predestinated to the truth without hearing his voice. &gt;&gt; And it isn't that you just get blessed in a service, whether you understand it or don't understand it. God can speak to you after you've left here. &gt;&gt; God can speak to you tomorrow while your sisters are in the house or your men are working or wherever you are. God can speak to you. Just come in a moment at time. &gt;&gt; But I'm speaking tonight that you'll be more aware, &gt;&gt; that you'll be more alerted, &gt;&gt; that you will have a consciousness, an awareness of his presence, this God. You can never escape him. Friends, he's there. He fills all time and space. When you move around tomorrow, just remember the air around you is filled with the God that's in you. &gt;&gt; That's absolutely the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he said now before we close this section, this is in the Leodysan church age. He said we must seriously consider these two thoughts. First this age will have one prophet messenger. Revelation 10:7 which he singular shall begin to sound. And then brother Brandham goes through a number of messengers and it was one Noah one Moses one. And then he says on the basis of human behavior alone, listen everybody, on the basis of human behavior alone, anyone knows that where there are many people, there is even divided opinion on lesser points. &gt;&gt; Now if we took a single subject here, some might think it's good. No, I don't think it's good. You'll have a whole variety of ideas and opinions. That's why I say to people, whatever you do, don't seek advice even from good intending people. &gt;&gt; Don't seek advice. First, I said to brother Dio once, what do you do with all these thousands of people and have all of these maybe questions and I spend a lot of time counseling. What do you do with a 68,000 people? He said, I tell him to go home and pray. I said, thanks. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he said, "You have &gt;&gt; I've heard it just in the last two weeks. &gt;&gt; I don't know what to do. This one said that and that one did that and that one said that." I said, "The biggest mistake you wasn't that you asked anybody." &gt;&gt; You should have just kept it to yourself. &gt;&gt; Go to prayer. Ask God. &gt;&gt; And and and if you have to talk to somebody who's not going to say anything, &gt;&gt; and let's hope it's a preacher. And he says they have all kinds of divided opinion on lesser points of a major doctrine which they will all hold together. He says who then will have the power listen now. Who then church those you Cloverdale by the way I wish this church was absolutely filled this Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; Who then will have the power of infallibility? Infallibility is without error. &gt;&gt; Where do we have an absolute? &gt;&gt; Where can we cast our anchor? &gt;&gt; And once we cast our anchor said, "We're done. &gt;&gt; I've cast my anchor. I don't need another anchor. &gt;&gt; This is going to hold me. &gt;&gt; Through every wind, &gt;&gt; every storm, &gt;&gt; I've cast my anchor." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Where's the power of infallibility which is to be restored in the last age? &gt;&gt; It's going to go back to manifesting the pure word bride. &gt;&gt; I may not feel like I'm there. You may not feel like you're there. God, eternal God, has got plenty of time. And not that I want to delay it, not that I want to uh, you know, make room for our errors or mistakes or whatever more, but it takes time to mature. &gt;&gt; And if I'm not where I ought to be or you're not where you ought to be, don't give up. &gt;&gt; Cuz God won't give up. &gt;&gt; I say you're going to, if you're an elected seed, you're going to come &gt;&gt; one way or another. &gt;&gt; The easy way or the hard way, but you're going to come. All you have to do is decide today that you are or you aren't. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And even if you decide you aren't, God might not agree with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; He's not afraid of your failures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not even afraid of your sin. He'll just forgive you &gt;&gt; if you just ask him. He's got the bleach waiting &gt;&gt; for you to drop that drop of ink in it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He just delights in abolishing it. &gt;&gt; He delights in breaking it up so you can't find it. &gt;&gt; And you keep looking and the devil keeps looking and they can't find it. &gt;&gt; And God sits back and he has a wonderful time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz he's the only one who's got that. &gt;&gt; Nobody else has got that. &gt;&gt; He just annihilates it. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; He creates something and annihilates others. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he says about this prophet, he said that means we will have the word once again as it was. And I'm closing now right away. He has he'll have the word. It was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of Paul. I will tell you who will have it. It will be a prophet as thoroughly vindicated or even more thoroughly vindicated than was any prophet in all the ages. He says from Enoch to this day. And you've heard me say, and I'm not ashamed of it, and I I I don't expect to ever change it. There's been no messenger, no prophet like this since Adam. &gt;&gt; None. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's never been a record where anybody stands up with 40, 50 people in front of them tonight and tomorrow night and the next night and next night and be able to say years later has it ever been wrong. &gt;&gt; Never been wrong. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, look what you're connected to. &gt;&gt; It's infallibility. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says he won't need to speak for himself. &gt;&gt; God will speak for him by the voice of the sign. &gt;&gt; I want you to hear this just very brief audio clip. And if it's too loud, that's fine. &gt;&gt; I ask for them to make it loud. &gt;&gt; Let it boom out here in this auditorium. So they're doing the best they can. Oh God, my father, I come in Jesus name to pray for this people who has now honestly and sincerely have confessed their wrongs. Oh blessed God, may this be a night that they'll never forget. May the Holy Spirit come into every heart just now and just move out all everything and all the sickness from their body. I now challenge the devil to a debate. &gt;&gt; That's what I like. Satan, you are aware that you are whipped. &gt;&gt; You have no legal rights. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, my Lord, stripped you of every authority you had when he died at Calvary to take away sin and sickness. And you're nothing but a bluff. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're calling your blood. &gt;&gt; You know that when our Lord came to the tree, he cursed the tree. The next day it was withering. And our Lord said to his disciples, "Have faith in God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For if ye shall say, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Ye shall say, &gt;&gt; "This mountain, &gt;&gt; be moved." &gt;&gt; Don't doubt in your heart, but believe what you have said is coming to pass. You can have what you said. &gt;&gt; Satan, you know the scripture on that. And I've just taught this people that God is in them. Yes. &gt;&gt; And if God is in them and they speak to that disease and say be away from me and don't doubt in their heart right then that disease has to move for Christ said so. For it's not them that speak. It's the father that dwells in them that's speaking. They're in need. So come out of them in the name of Jesus Christ. I say as God's servant by a message from an angel who anointed and has proved to the people that Jesus is here and the message is right. So come out of them in the name of Jesus Christ. I adjure you to leave every sick person and get into outer darkness in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [Music] &gt;&gt; Did you hear that? &gt;&gt; I'm sure you heard that. &gt;&gt; How many heard that great roar go through the building just then? &gt;&gt; That was it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Surely you won't down any longer. &gt;&gt; That was God speaking back. &gt;&gt; Can't you see? &gt;&gt; God speaking back. &gt;&gt; Rise. You believe you're healed? &gt;&gt; You believe that God answered prayer? Raise your hands to him. Thank him for it. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's over. &gt;&gt; You're healed. God speaking back. &gt;&gt; Maybe the people didn't hear it. God heard it. &gt;&gt; God spirit. &gt;&gt; The same God that said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; spoke in that building with a roar. &gt;&gt; But in the roar, it wasn't Apostle Paul. It wasn't the people with him hearing the roar. It was a prophet in the end time heard the roar. He said, "Did you hear it? That was God speaking." &gt;&gt; And God said, "You're healed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Ricardo, it's not 2,000 years ago. It's today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Lisa, for standing. Hallelujah. An act of faith. Why not have it? &gt;&gt; Why not enjoy it? It's here. It's available. It's present with us. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's God that's called you. &gt;&gt; It's God that's called you. &gt;&gt; You're his sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is God's decree. &gt;&gt; Don't doubt. &gt;&gt; Believe. &gt;&gt; Believe. &gt;&gt; With everything that's in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So many of the voices, so many of the voices, he said the voices of this life, you know, he said there's voices of troubles and voices of problems that that you don't have to have the problem present with you, but it just rotates within you. &gt;&gt; You keep hearing it. It's this way and that way and how am I going to overcome? How am I going to handle this one? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is so complex. This is so involved. Involves that person, this person, that brother, this brother. You got to cast it down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have to cast it down. &gt;&gt; You know, we're not going to fix it. &gt;&gt; The main thing is that God's voice speaks to you. Imagine all that crowd of people that was there. I have another. There's another one where the roar is incredible and it just roars through the building. And brother Benam says says, "On the day of Pentecost, there came a great wind and that wind blows right through that building at that time. &gt;&gt; It's much louder than even this, &gt;&gt; that same one." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That spoke that &gt;&gt; that same God &gt;&gt; hasn't changed one iota. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's us that change and us is get we get all uh uh what do I say? We get weighted down. &gt;&gt; We become weary. Our minds can only handle so much. &gt;&gt; Let's cast all of our burden on him. &gt;&gt; For he carth for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When I think of God that creates the heavens and the planets and all of these things, &gt;&gt; you think that he's not mindful of us. In fact, it's I think it's a sin. It's wrong for us to become so completely overwhelmed with things of this life that we can't possibly even uh uh you know give him the place of honor that he deserves. &gt;&gt; I believe how great is our God. How great is his name? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Will you join me? &gt;&gt; Let's have the musicians. &gt;&gt; Let's sing praises to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; The world isn't going to do it. &gt;&gt; Your school isn't going to do it out there. The school of the world, our school would, but the business place, you're not going to hear this in the shopping mall. &gt;&gt; So, let us let us give glory to God. You're going to go in a restaurant and hear some great thumping demonic music. Let's make music that God, this God will enjoy. &gt;&gt; Let's gladden the heart of our father. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's stand together. &gt;&gt; How great is our God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Turn this music up. I want to fill this place and rattle the &gt;&gt; beams. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Help me sing. Brother Derek, if you can't sing, make a make a sound, a joyful noise.

I want to hear you make more noise praising God than bouncing a ball. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you think that this is bad, you don't want to go to heaven &gt;&gt; cuz I'm going to be in heaven. I'm going to make a lot more noise. I'm making down here. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; As soon as you crossed over, I tell you what, we're going to be a bunch of fanatics. Amen. &gt;&gt; I can't be I can't be tempted anymore. I can't have a bad thought anymore. Can't have a bad feeling anymore. Is that all right, Tyler? &gt;&gt; It's okay. &gt;&gt; We're going to be there. You'll be a fanatic, too. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All right, let's sing it.

Amen. &gt;&gt; We got a wonderful guide, wonderful savior. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. A creator. &gt;&gt; He spoke to your earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Said, "You're going to come forth &gt;&gt; in a different form." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not just a human. You're going to come forth a son of God. &gt;&gt; A daughter of God. I sent a message to change you. &gt;&gt; And that's just the beginning. &gt;&gt; I'm going to change your atoms. You're going to come in another body. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; And to prove it to you, I got a theophony right beside you. &gt;&gt; You're going to take a step and step into it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You talk about a veil. This one here, the devil can get at. He can get in this flesh and he can do all kinds of things. He gets in this mind. He gets in all this emotional realm. &gt;&gt; Lies to us all the time. tells us that, you know, things are good, then tells us things are bad, all kinds of things, &gt;&gt; but he won't be able to do a thing once you step into that one. &gt;&gt; Glory. Soon the rain will be allowed. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Yeah. All the while. Oh my god. [Applause] Yeah. Heat. [Applause] Hallelujah. Brother Kyle. Hallelujah. [Music] I tell you, this brother's got a voice. Brother Kyle, he's got a voice. He was up there hunting. He and Brother Dave, they went down to the boat just down the hill about 100 ft from the camp. What do you know? There's a moose standing right there in the water. First thing I heard was kaboom, kaboom, you know. Then I hear this man's voice. I mean, he sounded more than this loudspeaker. He yelled, "Moose, bring guns." And I said, "Uh, I said to brother Sam," I said, "That's just exactly the way he preaches. Just says right to the point, move, bring guns." Then he came up, he said, "Did you hear me?" I said, "Hear you?" I thought you had lifted up the tent were yelling under the tent. &gt;&gt; Well, now I'm glad that brother Kyle God changed his tune &gt;&gt; from the days of the world and all the excitement of the basketball and all the rest of it. He's in a different game. &gt;&gt; The game of eternity, &gt;&gt; giving his life to preach the gospel. Whatever God has in store for him. Brother Kyle, come. Hope you don't mind me with that little person. &gt;&gt; God bless you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Say blessing all the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, let's pray together. Lord Jesus, it's it's so obvious. It's been good to be here tonight. Lord, you've spoken to us to our hearts. Lord Jesus, I believe everyone from the youngest to the oldest can go home. Lord, thankful that you spoke to our hearts, Lord Jesus. It's just been a it's been a special evening, oh God. It's just I I appreciate it, Lord, how you talk to me so personally, Lord. And Lord, we thank you for that. Thank you for all the good things you're doing for us, Lord, in our lives, Lord, for salvation and so much more. Jesus, thank you for this this gathering of people, Lord, and for the ministry that you've sent by our way to speak to our hearts, Lord Jesus. I just pray that you you help us now as we go our separate ways, Father. Help us meditate on those things that you spoke to us personally, Lord Jesus. And may they could just grow. And Lord, may they just be be able to flourish and bring forth fruit in our lives, Lord Jesus. We just don't want, as brother John was speaking, Lord, the water to go inside of us and to flow out and be lost, Lord, but may it be able to be useful, Lord, and to nourish us and to strengthen us, Lord Jesus. We didn't just come here in vain or just to spend time, Lord, but it was so good to be here, Father. Just thank you for it. You bless everyone. Keep them safe as they go home, Lord, different ones of Seattle and help us, Lord, be prepared for the events tomorrow and the next day, Lord, and bring us back safely to on Sunday to the service, Lord. We appreciate you in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; Going to let you go and be dismissed in Jesus name and want you to be happy in the Lord and believe what you heard tonight. Will you do that? Drive safe on the road and Lord willing, we'll see you Friday night. If not Friday, we'll see you Sunday and be praying for the meeting Sunday. Sunday evening, Brother Murphy's going to going to speak and and tell you about what's been happening. And I know he won't be able to cover in one service, but he it'll be a good it'll be a good uh we'll get a good portion of it. God bless you. You're all dismissed. Have a great day in school tomorrow, kids. All right. God bless you. [Music] Hey. Hey. Hey. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
