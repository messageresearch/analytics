We ask brother John Stall, senior. Brother John, if you'd come, open the service in a word of prayer. Sister Roxanne has a couple of prayer requests. First off, she would like to say, "My dad wishes to thank everyone for their prayers. He's doing really well and has had a a good report from his doctor. He's trusting God for a complete healing. So, we want to thank the Lord for that. Also, Sister Roxan has a note here. My brother Daniel asked that we pray for one of his students who is a Catholic man who is searching and is unhappy with the church. Daniel gave him the message, God is his own interpreter on CD. pray for guidance and wisdom for Daniel to uh his life as well. We got a prayer request here. Please pray for please remember the St. John's in prayer. In two days a great financial burden could be lifted if the Lord will provide a decision in in our favor. Amen. We thank you so much and God bless you. Amen. We want to remember the St. John's tonight. Amen. If you have a need this morning, if you're on the telephone hookup on the internet, I just ask that you stand with us. Raise your hand and hearts as we go to prayer. Brother John, if you'd come, let's all bow our heads in reverence to God. We're here this morning, Lord Jesus, to praise your holy name. Almighty creator of heavens and earth. Nothing is too big or too small for you, Lord, that you not intervene in our behalf. We're here to praise you, for the stones will not praise you. The dead will not raise your name up either. You are the God of all the universe. For every tongue shall confess, every knee shall bow that they are God. There is no other God before us. You are the king of kings, the god of all gods and and and lord of all lords. There is none but you lord. Oh there's no other existence in the whole universe but and all power and glory flows from you. You are the tree of life. You are the fountain of living waters from where power flows flows through to us. Oh God so that we can live day by day being being subject to your will and way for this purpose you have placed us here on this earth. And now, oh Lord God, for these requests which have been pinned down and written, Lord, for sister Roxanne, oh God, giving you thanks, Lord, for what you have done in the lives of her family, oh God, we just received the sacrifice this morning, Lord, and there is and the and the utterance of praises and glory to your most holy name, Lord. And for this other financial burden, this brother St. John, whatever, oh God, we just ask, Lord, for you're more than able. You are you are the Lord who has a kettle on a thousand hills. Oh Lord Jesus, you're more than able to meet all our needs, Lord. Whatever it might be, spiritual, physical, uh uh financially, where whatever, oh God, we all need to just raise up our hands, Lord, and what you have said, Lord, whosoever there are three or four gathered in your name, Lord, and the request will be brought to you in your name. These these requests shall be granted, Lord. And here we are a needy people, Lord. other crisises in the midst of the of the family of God. Lord, in my own family, Lord, &gt;&gt; I just bring this need before you Lord. Oh God, &gt;&gt; you know what is needed. Lord, you can apply the balm of Gilead. Lord, &gt;&gt; you can pour in that which is needed to comfort those that have need of comforting. my daughter Eli. Lord, &gt;&gt; we just lift her up before you Lord. &gt;&gt; You know what is needed. You know what is required. Lord, many prayers of going heaven word in her behalf. Lord, you are the one that is able to pour in that need that what is which is needed, Lord. &gt;&gt; And we commit her into your hands in this service, Lord. that everything which is needy in the body of Christ Lord would be poured out from the mount of the minister which would be speaking and sitting behind his sacred desk. Lord, &gt;&gt; I know how my soul has been fed, Lord, from year to year. All the time we have sojourned here, how always has been, Lord, poured in at the right time, at the right moment, that which is needed. And we just commit everything into your hands. Whatever would be sung, whatever be done to your honor, to your praise, and to your glory, just receive it, Lord. For we believe we're here a body of pe we're here a body of people with sincere hearts that have come here for one purpose and that's to glorify your holy name Lord and to lift you up high most high Lord. Oh God and this is what our desire is here this morning. Otherwise, if this if this is not the purpose of our ba being gathered here together, our coming here is in vain, Lord. And just implement up and impregnate into our hearts, Lord, the real purpose and the real reason why you're here. And it's just for your honor for your glory. That in the midst of all this turmoil which is in the world, all around us, Lord, there is a place of rest. There is a place of place of refuge where we can find comfort and peace, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. Amen. Love his presence.

Heavenly Father, we've sung psalms and we have prayed prayers. Our brother John Stall moved by the Holy Spirit as he prayed, sensing, oh God, your spirit continuing. And as our choir singing, oh God, and the people singing and we're worshiping you, we pray that you'll be pleased to be amongst us. Not only in the service now but throughout this day. Not only in this building but where the many other places where people are worshiping with us just now. They may be a hospital room. Oh God in a home where others are gathered across the seas in other lands. But we are here, oh God, to be inspired by the Holy One of Israel. And we pray that this day shall be a dedicated day to you and the service this evening, Lord, and your servant, our brother Lance, as he will speak and take the word, oh God. And in the coming days, Father, we think of the young people gathering. And Lord, we do not want to simply have set times when we gather, but we pray that you will be in attendance at every one of these meetings and gatherings. Oh God, now Lord, as we're approaching your word shortly, pray that you will anoint us mightily. We thank you for dedicated lives. We thank you, oh God, for the riches we have in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Your will now be done. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you, choir. Thank you. Well, we are happy to be able to report that the saints in China were set free. Amen. This last week, I believe Thursday evening. We don't have any other details. Uh we just know that they've been set free. And I haven't had a chance to uh to speak yet with uh those that may have more more knowledge of it, but that's just what we've heard. Also see brother Ernie's back. My just good to see you. I saw you on the little monitor there and it just warmed my heart, brother Ernie. And we need to hear about the Philippines. We there's been some outstanding things. I I I don't think that things happen, you know, just by accident. uh there there isn't anyone of us and there is no human that can really determine the full effect of what the message has been doing in the Philippines many parts of the world but the Philippines we're speaking of just now and to think that the people were gathering from all over the islands and ministers in these mystery expo we may call them mystery expo but really what it is it's the word penetrating ing the hearts of the people and the hearts of ministers and our brother Ernie along with the other ministers there have been uh focusing on on men ministers to see where there's an open door and been let getting the message out into the into the country uh and ministers from all over and some of them now for the second time and others have been rebaptized and taken the message back to their church. Well, it's no mystery to me that right in the midst of all of this, you know, there's a fire and our office is is largely destroyed and we have to move to another place. And it's no mystery to me then that four terrible storms sweep that country and there's still, I think, over a thousand missing and there has been hundreds and hundreds killed. And I don't know if you saw it or not, but it really touched my heart in a picture in the newspaper there. People are are are going single file, a group of them. And uh the first one in the picture is a little girl, probably 11 years old, maybe 12 years old. And she is mud from the top of her head. had a little flimsy dress on, walking over debris and sticks and a slide of some kind of a mudslide where they must have been buried. And she's walking in her bare feet trying to I I I tried to imagine myself walking where she was walking. It was just impossible to think a person could navigate that kind of place. And I I just you know I tell you what that it is no mystery that those things are happening and coinciding all at one time. God is is uh God is speaking and allowing even these disasters to to come to the island such as it is all at the same time. I try to keep myself open and sensitive and you just see these things happening. I feel that we have a part and I'm glad that we're able to play whatever part we're able to play and the brothers who go out from from this congregation here and I pray that God will send them out from many congregations but especially now that God will speak mightily to the people of the Philippines. Who knows if all of this happened and we know that God doesn't send disasters but he can use them. he can use them. &gt;&gt; And so uh uh these disasters come, what would happen if if brother Ernie's trip over there and all the united efforts of all the all the ministers over there and all of the mystery expose and and all of them just got one minister and maybe he took it back to his church and got one person and there was two out of this whole thing. What if the disaster such as we've just had conditioned somebody's heart to say, you know, there must be something else. And and all of these things coming together got one soul. &gt;&gt; It was all worth it. &gt;&gt; Worth it a million times worth it. So, we're so thankful that Brother Ernie's back and and we certainly want to have you prepare, Brother Ernie, so we can hear uh not only what's happening, but we I think the church is privileged and I hope you don't weary. We hear of China one week and who knows, you know, we we we get a lot of word and we have a lot of word in our home and now we're able to, you know, to hear what this word is doing elsewhere. All right. We feel privileged about that. I trust I just can't. I'm not made to be able to sit here in this country and just sit and be self-satisfied and eat my food and live in my home and drive my car and come here to this church and not be affected by people who don't have any of that, don't have the message and don't have a church and don't have a building and don't don't have any any music and they don't have any of those things. I just can't sit here and be satisfied. I just think that we need to be a conduit to pour out the blessing. And whether it be through the internet or whether it be over the telephone or whether it be through our offerings or whether it be through trying to help out in another country, I think that God in fact is I know I know that God is pleased with that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Freely you have received &gt;&gt; freely give. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think I see uh Sarah here. Sarah Dingwall is brother Jonathan Bergen's fiance. We just announced that their marriage upcoming and uh and nice to have you here Sarah. God bless you. Amen. All right, I'll have you turn in your Bibles to Genesis the 40 5th chapter. And while you're just holding your Bible there, you can give me your attention. I'm going to read three other verses. David said, "Look upon mine affliction and my pain and forgive all my sins." He said again, "Hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities." In Isaiah it is said, "Behold, for peace I have great bitterness, but thou hast in love to my soul, delivered it from the pit of corruption. For thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back." &gt;&gt; Are those wonderful words? &gt;&gt; Aren't those wonderful words? and the revelation and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness, the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood. The prophet said he loosed us from our sins. Now we're going to read from the eth from the 1st to the eth verse. Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him. And he cried, "Cause every man to go out from me." And there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. And he wept aloud. And the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph. Doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him. For they were troubled at his presence. And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, "I am Joseph, your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. Now therefore, be not grieved nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither. For God did send me before you to preserve life. For these two years hath the famine been in the land, and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earring nor harvest. And God sent me before you to preserve you for a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives in a great deliverance. So now it was not you that sent me Heather, but God, and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. May God bless his word to our hearts. Thank you. You may be seated. I want to continue from last week and this may sound like a strange scripture to continue with the subject the blame game part two. I wondered at first if I would ever speak this because it is such a uh it's such a vast subject. that covers such a vast area of human life and our human experience and I just didn't know if I could be adequate. I believe that God helped us last Sunday and I believe that God from the word that I've heard from you. Uh I've had a lot of response both by email and and directly and I I trust that uh this will be continuing that there will be a lasting effect upon you. uh this message did not come you know to just to kind of tickle our ears or to stir us momentarily. The message came to make permanent change within our lives. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said in the message shalom he said crossing the nation and speaking and the Lord God identifying and a vindicating. He's saying a lot here. saying God coming and vindicating and confirming and identifying his word and showing that's exactly and never let nothing be said unless it comes to pass exactly what he said. Now here's a prophet in prophetic me ministry and he said speaking it right into existence and so forth. Look how far that's going. Just to the third pull to that creative word of God coming out of a prophet's mouth and he's been doing and people sit there and look at that and continue right on in the same condition. &gt;&gt; Now that was really something. What he's saying is after seeing it vindicating and seeing it confirmed and seeing the word actually in in action, the creative word of God, what he's saying is that there should have been a change. &gt;&gt; He said in uh also in in shalom, these are he said it in Phoenix and said it in Sierra Vista. He said, "I crossed the nation preaching." I think so this was in his mind. He said, "I cross the nation preaching against this thing and come back the next year and it's worse than it was when I started." The He said, "The people want to do right, but there's something about it that won't let them do right. It just presses down on them, forces them. It's like a heavy dark fog over the whole earth. Not only in Phoenix, but all over the world. There seems to be just a groping darkness that's gathering, getting more dense and dense all the time, just smothering out real manhood and womanhood. And so here we are many years down the road from that. And it's it it's heavier now. I'll say the fog's thicker now. &gt;&gt; And it's a heavier weight even now. But the word of God which came, the message which came is not only adequate, but it's more than sufficient. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; More than sufficient for us. And so I am speaking because I I desire that if God uh initiates something in your heart uh within your own self that you sense there God is speaking to me through this word. I pray that you will take that and say, uh, God, make this to be a a a substance in my life that will be uh that will have continuity, that it's not just something I just have a a stir during a service in a Sunday morning, but that God uh continues that in my life and some corrective measure, let it continue. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to take this uh the blame game and and be weaving in three different thoughts. Last Sunday I took the blame game just shifting the blame onto elsewhere for things that have occurred in our lives. And like I said, it covers such a broad expanse of of our life. It can go from childhood in some cases, from married life. It can be abuse of all kinds. Such a broad scope of of events that can and has taken place. And there isn't anyone that has not been touched by this and affected by it one way or another. uh and there isn't anyone but what we have engaged in placing the blame elsewhere &gt;&gt; and so even this phrase is very very common today and there you know who's to blame for uh uh 911 and who's to blame for the crucifixion of Jesus Christ that's been going on for 2,000 years the Catholics say the Jews are the Jews say the Catholics were the Romans were and Everybody says, "Well, I tell you what, it was God who led the lamb to Calvary." &gt;&gt; And if they only would read the scripture, they would know that. But but it's just it's just that spirit of the age that's here. It's always someone else's fault. And in blaming someone else, then we get a sense of justification. So I want to that I'll I'll touch on a little bit more of that. And secondly, there is also this that I have observed where some people are made up in a just a certain way where they are they are so self-examining of themselves that they place all the blame for things upon themselves and I'm a failure and I'm no good and all the rest of it and give Satan an advantage for condemnation &gt;&gt; and that also is a great error. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the third which I want to which our scripture bears out today is where a person takes all the blame upon themselves in the in the spirit of Christ so that uh there is there is none of this trying to discover what degree of fault is yours. &gt;&gt; You're 40% to blame. I'm 60% to blame. You're 90% to blame. I'm 10% and and you did and I did and they said and he said and she said and that and then this happened and then that happened. That gets absolutely nowhere. &gt;&gt; That gets absolutely nowhere. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to show you it's unscriptural. &gt;&gt; Going to show you in the scripture that it's unscriptural. And so now we have read this uh scripture concerning Joseph and his brethren coming to him. I thought as I read this, what a perfect opportunity Joseph had. Now, you have to remember many years have gone by from a young man now sold and finally comes into Egypt and and he goes through all of his his trials in Egypt and and uh uh even Pharaoh's wife seeking to tempt him to an adultery and then going into prison for two years uh because of her lie and because of all of this. And he was he was he was perfection. He was a perfect type of Christ, but it was being lived out in a very ordinary life. He lived a life like you and I. He felt like you and I did. And now he's standing there in all of his royalty and the in the glory of the nation and the power, an interpreter of dreams, a dreamer of dreams, an interpreter of dreams. And and and now has risen. He's, as he said, he's become a father to Pharaoh. And he's standing there in all of that in all of that riches and all of that vindication. And now his dream from many many many years ago uh has come to pass. And here is his brothers uh uh kneeling before him, frustrating themselves before him. He could have said, "I told you so. I'm Joseph." &gt;&gt; Now it's finally come to pass when I spoke it. I want you to know that that's the God that I serve. He had the most He had the most, I would say, perfect opportunity to cause them to gravel &gt;&gt; before him in their utter failure and in their despair and all of the rest of it. He could have rubbed their noses down into the ground and said, "You deserved it and now you're getting it." &gt;&gt; What an opportunity. Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice in his in his comments here which is in the word of God because he had to live out the perfect type of Christ. He could not bring up any of their failure. &gt;&gt; Even though they had failed, listen, they hated him. The scripture tells us they were jealous of him. The scripture tells us they were jealous of the favor because he was a favorite son of his father and had the coat of many colors. They were jealous over that. And because he was a dreamer of dreams, they hated him more. &gt;&gt; And because of the dreams which even involved his mother and father, the scripture tells us that they didn't understand him, &gt;&gt; that they felt something against him. And so he had all of these things. this jealousy. He could have thought of them throwing him in the pit. He could have thought of them uh lying to his father knowing that his father was living all these years with the grief of his lost son being destroyed. &gt;&gt; I'd lost a son. And in fact is when these uh when his brothers were standing before him and he wanted to you know uh cause them to to to say what was in their heart. He said you know you're spies. No they said we're not spies. We are 12 sons of of a man and uh we're not spies and the youngest of us is still with their father and one is not standing right there in front of them. Amen. &gt;&gt; And one is not. They said it twice. And one is not. What a statement. And one is not. But there he was. You know something? We've all been in that place. We didn't know where God is, where where's our redemption, where is our salvation, where's our deliverance, and stand right in front of us. Amen. &gt;&gt; The one we thought was not in your life was standing right there. He was going to interrupt you someplace along the along the way. &gt;&gt; You thought he was not. Maybe today you walked in and you haven't really had a lot of very deep spiritual thought and and you're in church and you're you know you've been going through the service and so on so forth, but maybe in your mind he's quite distant. But yet in as far as God is concerned, he's right there before you, in front of you, ready to do what you need to have done. &gt;&gt; And we thought, well, he's not, but he is. &gt;&gt; The agony of his father that his father endured. He had all of these things, but he did not engage in the so common and so human thing of placing blame. He could never have portrayed Christ had he placed the blame. &gt;&gt; But what an opportunity. And they were to fault. They were to blame. But he saw something greater. He saw the bigger picture. He said, "It wasn't you in the first place. It wasn't you that sold me into Egypt. God brought me here." &gt;&gt; He saw the bigger picture of the thing that was happening. Every single person here in this building has had great adversity take place in their lives. And you you uh uh have every reason to believe. In fact, as you may be sitting there and saying, "But brother Ed, this did happen." And it was her fault. It was his fault. It was their fault. It was my employer, my wife, my husband, my children, my parents. It was their fault. They did do this. And this has I am sitting here today because this happened. But you need to rise above and see a bigger picture. &gt;&gt; You need to see a bigger picture. You have to say today God has allowed this or it wouldn't be this way. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, sin did it. The devil did it. Whoever did it, but God permitted it." Or you wouldn't be. If you're a son and daughter of God, God has allowed it. And you need to get to rise to that place and then that will open the door for the correct attitude towards it &gt;&gt; to deal with it in the right way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is said then said Jesus. Now he could have said he could have laid the blame upon them but then said Jesus father forgives them. Listen for they know not what they do. &gt;&gt; And they parted his raignment and cast lots and there he is stripped naked in open shame bearing our shame and bearing our sin. certainly wasn't for anything that he did that he was hanging there suffering this terrible terrible death &gt;&gt; but it is human and we come by it in a very natural way because our first parents did it and that's where I started last Sunday and God said to Adam hast thou eaten of the tree and he said, "The woman that you gave me, she gave it to me and I did eat." In other words, if you hadn't created her in the first place and brought her to me, &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be in this fix. &gt;&gt; No. the woman that you gave, she gave it to me and I did eat. And he said to the woman, "What is this that thou hast done?" And the woman said, "The serpent beguiled me." In fact, he deceived me. And brother Brandham said, "Deception, of course, is when you don't know that you're even doing it. &gt;&gt; You don't know that this is going to go where it's going to go." It was a deception. And she was, she said, "He beguiled me and I did eat." Beguiled, not only to deceive, but to mislead by guile. And oh, that's a horrible practice. And I do see it and I do find it when people say something and and and they they will make a statement here, but they actually want you to believe this over here. And that's what happens. It goes in a triangle. A statement is made, but a person believes this over here. What they believe over here is actually a lie. But what was said wasn't directly a lie, but it was intended that you would believe a lie. &gt;&gt; And that's what guile is. &gt;&gt; Guile is when you may speak a half a truth. You may speak a half a truth but it's said in such a way in such a manner. It's said with uh uh with the in in an opportunity to cause a person to believe something false and then that's what happens. That is beguiled and and to draw away or to charm away. And that is what the serpent did. And since that time, everybody has engaged, whether you want to admit it or not, we have engaged in what is known as I said and the title of this message in the blame game. Everyone, who's here that hasn't been hurt? Who's here that hasn't been wounded? Who's here that hasn't been at some point in life Christ? David experienced the same. And usually it's not some stranger walking down the street that just says to us in passing, "I hate you." It wouldn't mean anything. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I don't know you." You have to I have said, and I don't know that it's exactly correct or not, but I have said because I have believed it. You have to love before you can hate. &gt;&gt; You actually have to Because hate is a perversion of love. &gt;&gt; And David said, "Yay, my own familiar friend in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread. We sat at the same table. We had fellowship together. We were close enough. My own familiar friend in whom I trusted, which did eat my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me. It wasn't one that was some enemy down the way, but it was my familiar friend, the one that was close to me. Jesus said, "I speak not to you all. I know whom I have chosen, but that the scripture might be fulfilled. He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me. That was that was the fulfillment of that scripture. But yet David experienced the same thing. That's what he experienced. He experienced it. He actually lived it out on that side of the cross. He lived it out because he was living out a part of Christ. We're on this side of the cross. And often we have some here and I'm trying to cover a broad scope. uh h of of our human experience. But there's sometimes and most often it is even within a family or an extended family or within the congregation because we are a family. &gt;&gt; The body of Christ is a family. &gt;&gt; It is the family of God. and and our disappointments or our our experiences in life, whether it be in our natural family or within the spiritual family. We can and have experienced crushing experiences that uh give a open door, give a opening for us to and it's only natural we would like to place the blame. Well, if if he had not done or she had not done or if they had done this would be different, etc. It can go on and on and it does go on and on. And so the the the the thing that I find is necessary is that a person needs to come to a place where they can rise in the spirit of Christ and be able to cope with these things in a in a Christlike way. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this this this service this morning is going to be a tall order. It's a real tall order. So David said, "It's my familiar friend. It's somebody that's been trusted, somebody that you have given you have given yourself to or you have uh grown up with or you have you're united into perhaps one family unit. And this is where it usually starts. Remember remember now we're we're going back to Eden. Eden was the first family unit and Satan coming through the instrumentality of the serpent. The first thing he did was to break up the family unit. &gt;&gt; That is his first and and that is his first and still his target. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said to me, he said, "The sin of the beginning will be the sin of the end." &gt;&gt; Amen. And we as a congregation of people, there's no use me talking about, you know, pie in the sky things that aren't a reality to you. You're nice and quiet because these things are a reality. &gt;&gt; We have experienced disastrous things. In fact is let me go take a step further. In many cases outside of God helping us to cope with these things, uh there is a there's something within the human psyche that can blank those things out &gt;&gt; and the a wall goes up and we've blanked out even within our subconscious. It just becomes a part of our life. Don't go there. I don't go there. Nobody goes there. But let me tell you something. You have to allow God to go there &gt;&gt; because the scripture says he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted. &gt;&gt; A lot of people there, you're perhaps even here today and you have gone through a crushing, destructive, catastrophic experience in life. And it might be years ago, &gt;&gt; but you have never really dealt with it. It just remains something that's blocked off. It's blanked out. And that it happens to be a result of this uh this uh evil age which we are in. And let me say I want to say so many things here today. God give me the strength to say it. And we are not getting we're not coming to a time when things are going to be easier and nicer. The fog is getting thicker &gt;&gt; and the darkness is getting thicker and heavier and the weight is getting heavier. And what we've experienced here is going to be more of it. &gt;&gt; We've got here the the result of many broken homes, which is the same serpent that crawled into Eden. He's the same one that's doing the same thing even at this very hour. &gt;&gt; And there's no use us running and hiding and putting our head in the sand as though these things don't happen. They do happen and they have happened and they will continue to happen. But we need to deal with it in a scriptural manner, in a scriptural way. And I can tell you one way that will never never work. It is to seek where where the blame is. &gt;&gt; It's 50% this way, 50 that way. It's 60 40 70. It just happens to have happened. We got young people that are here that have never really known perhaps the life with a father or the life with a mother or the life of a united home. We have others that are completely wonderfully united homes. They've never experienced a sing. So I don't know what you're talking about, brother Biscll. Nevertheless, it happens to be a very real reality. And it's something that the that the gospel of Jesus Christ in this end time is going to is coping with and and there's power within this message to take care of those things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. for someone who has gone through those things. There's people there's there's young people who who are married here who never experienced a united home. They didn't have a father and mother in the home. And now they are a mother. They are a wife. They are a father. They are a husband. And they're not too sure exactly how to handle it. They've never had an example. &gt;&gt; They've never had a father image before them. There never had a mother image before them. There wasn't a mother there. But let me tell you something, friends. The author of motherhood happens to be represented right here in the book. The author of fatherhood happens to be represented right here in the book. And if we heed and hear what God has spoken and allow the Holy Spirit to come and infuse us with the same spirit of this book, you will have motherhood. You will have fatherhood. And you won't have to figure out who's to follow. Sometimes the sources of these experiences which we have had are distant. And as I said earlier, and I want to just dwell on it a moment, so difficult to deal with that even here in a service such as we're having within the minds of there's grown up adults here that were abused as children. They don't want to go there. But I'll tell you one thing, you have to let Christ go there. &gt;&gt; You'll have to open up the door to that. There's been those that perhaps have been abused terribly by an alcoholic mother or father, and you just can't blank it out like, well, it never happened. It doesn't exist. All the rest of it, because that wound, that wound is there. &gt;&gt; And he came to heal the broken &gt;&gt; hearted. Amen. &gt;&gt; For the spirit of the Lord is upon me. And it's the same Christ that's alive today. This is the same son of man revealed now. When the message came, he came with healing in his wings. &gt;&gt; But you can't just hold that off. &gt;&gt; I read of a therapist. I read his own account and he was counseling a woman and in the midst of his counseling and when they were at a certain point he said to her, "How old do you feel just now?" And she said, "Nine." Nine years old. Because that is when the trauma took place. when she finally he finally uh got to the point right at the point a critical point. How old do you feel just now? &gt;&gt; Nine. I feel nine. Because now she was back there, not just in her memory, but something that was blanked out. You see, here's my point. You might say, "Well, Brother Bisll, why in the world are you speaking to us in such a way?" I'll tell you why. Because as long as that lays there undelt with, Satan knows where that is. &gt;&gt; And he'll come back there and that thing will fester and keep rising up at at certain times and it'll be this one to blame. If I hadn't had this kind of a life, hadn't had this kind of a childhood, hadn't had this kind of a husband or this kind of a wife, my life could have been so different. You've got to allow Christ to come into that dark spot and heal that thing for once and for all. And then it'll be done. &gt;&gt; It'll be over. &gt;&gt; It'll be finished. &gt;&gt; And we won't engage in the blame game. [Music] You know, the world conjures up cute little phrases and they might be very appropriate. I don't know. But phrases that seem to fit certain situations and certain aspects of our our life. And you may have encountered this. I'm not a great reader of all kinds of other things other than the scriptures and the message, but I do a little bit of reading. And uh there was I I read a just a short segment of a person's own personal account of how they engaged for years in what this is known as the blame game. And uh apparently they have a a medical or psychological uh I they identified as borderline personality disorder BPD. And uh this one young fellow said, "In my journey of healing from borderline personality disorder, without realizing it for a great number of years, I was constantly blaming others for my problems and for my pain." He said, "It is very typical for someone with this borderline personality disorder." And I'm not I I don't say that that's what it is. In our case, it's the devil. &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it. But he has identified it and he said uh it's very typical for someone with this to honestly believe while in the throws of a distorted thought process that everything they feel is someone else's fault. So often a person with BPD will take out their confusion and pain on those who try to care. Someone comes and tries to be a help and an aid and somehow it gets transferred even to them on those who try to get close and try to stay close. What happens when someone tries to care to be close for many with this uh this disorder is that once a certain line is crossed in when they become too close then there comes like a transference they begin to offload all these things onto someone else onto one who's trying to help them out of the situation that they're in now you might you might just wonder now I I've given a lot of thought to this the reason I read the scripture which I read is because Joseph, not only did Joseph not engage in this, but these sons, they didn't tell him that they were guilty amongst themselves. They said, "We be guilty." Because they knew each other. And they knew the dark things that they had done. They said, "We be guilty." But they wouldn't tell anybody else. They wouldn't tell their father they were guilty. They wouldn't tell Joseph they were guilty. They didn't tell God they were guilty. They just kept it to themselves. We be guilty. But when they came now before before Joseph, before one who is not. He He in their minds, he didn't exist anymore. They didn't know what happened to him. We sold him. He's gone. We saw him just go off in a into the sunset on a pack of camels. We don't know what happened to him. Right. &gt;&gt; And when they're standing before Joseph and Joseph, he knew the whole thing. He knew it all. &gt;&gt; He knew what happened. &gt;&gt; He He knew he was thrown into a pit. He knew he had been sold to the merchants. And he knew he had been taken as a slave into Egypt. He knew he saw everything. He knew everything about it. But he was not trying to put any blame on anybody. He didn't even put the blame on that adulterous woman of Pharaoh's wife. &gt;&gt; Could have said that scoundrel, that liar tainted my life, put a terrible blemish on me and sent me to a dungeon, prison, ratinfested place with some other prisoners. &gt;&gt; Don't you see, friends? He didn't engage in that. He had every right &gt;&gt; and there's people that are here including myself and we and we we have events we have things which we encounter in life and we have somebody there who who is in fact to blame but when you see the bigger picture it we we're we we don't get anywhere by attaching the blame it doesn't do anything for us and last Sunday I spent most of the time on a horrible disastrous ous failure within even I'm talking about the bride of Jesus Christ. I think that many are living so far below where they should be living simply because they say well because this happened because that happened because this terrible disappointment because this thing went sideways because I experienced this I'm letting go of my spiritual convictions &gt;&gt; and we've experienced it. Well, because my parents are this, because my father's this, because my children are that, I I'm I'm just I I'm not throwing in the towel, but Oh, they say, "Well, do you deny that there's a message?" Oh, no. I don't deny that. Do you deny that Brother Brandham is a prophet of God? Oh. Oh, no. No. He's He's the prophet. I've had people are living right in sin. &gt;&gt; Say, "I still believe the message." Oh, no you don't. &gt;&gt; Oh, no you don't believe the message. Because that message wouldn't want that doesn't that message doesn't condone that kind of thing. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said if you don't do it, you don't believe it. &gt;&gt; Is that right? You don't do it, you don't believe it. So in order to believe it, if you really believe it, you do it. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking things that I've never spoken before. I've had people come into this church that have been so wounded, whose lives have been so destroyed by others by others been so destroyed. I'm not here to to resurrect memories, but those of you that feel that you're, you know, you're included in this, you allow me this because I must I must speak it. So destroyed by men that were trusted, men who were in position and women who were in position. People had been so trusted. They so gave themselves so completely. They'd had done anything for those people. They so loved them. They so trusted them spiritually, naturally, in every way. And then they were betrayed. Not only merely betrayed, not a promise broken, but abused &gt;&gt; and maybe led into into an area of their life where they were violated. literally violated and then come here so broken, so disrupt, so shattered that they hardly know their own name. I'm telling you, this congregation today, I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; I've experienced this not once, not twice, but many times. What is the way out? Okay, now we'll sit down and we'll just find out who's to blame. It would never have worked. &gt;&gt; Where's healing going to come from? Where's healing going to come from? I'm talking about people that have every reason in the world to lay blame and perhaps lay criminal charges. &gt;&gt; Evidence, criminal charges could have been laid. But are we now going to do that? Are we going to get somewhere that we can justify or vindicate or bring penalty upon someone? Are we uh will will this suffice? Will this do something? Even if you brought criminal charges, even if a person was able to get uh uh some money or be repaid, is that going to do it? No. And they're here today. They're sitting in church today. What is the answer? The message has told me that I've been instructed by the message that Satan has access to the memory channel. Amen. &gt;&gt; I have been instructed by a prophet's message that that memory channel has to be blown out &gt;&gt; by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And when that is blown out by the Holy Spirit, then and only then can God take control of it &gt;&gt; and begin to bring a healing to that part of that person's life. He came. He said, "I have come to heal the brokenhearted, the shattered, the broken, the distraught, &gt;&gt; the abused. I've come to heal them." And as time would go on and those things are never resurrected again, we look into the face of him. Knows me, knows where I've been, knows what's happened. He knows who's to fault. And I just come. I just come. I just give myself what is left of me. I give myself and I will believe that he can heal. I will believe that he can make out of me what he wants me to be. &gt;&gt; This scripture which is so beautiful. The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, and to set at liberty them that are bruised. Two words here, brokenhearted and bruised. And if you look into them, you'll find that they're both very similar. Now, you might be saying, "Well, we're in the message and we're so far beyond that, and we're, you know, that's way past uh other part of our lives." Well, I'm just not too sure that that is the case because I see where those traits come up and they come up within the congregation. They come up within the body of Christ. And there's a certain there's a certain uh sequence that happens every once in a while and I recall some right now as I stand here. It's in my mind. I've been asked, "Brother Biscll, I hear that you do a certain thing." In this case, it was television. I hear that you have a television. I said, "Well, I have a monitor and I have uh I have cable in the house because they cable all the houses, but I'm not connected. I don't have it." Well, this person, they had a young person, a a teenager, wanted to know that. Well, I answer them even though I know right at the case that right at that moment they're playing the blame game &gt;&gt; because they want to backslide &gt;&gt; and they are trying to find justification for their own backsliding. I know that's exactly the case. They want to backslide. And so even though I answered it, I answered it just exactly. I said, "No, I don't do not." Did that make any difference? Not one bit. that young person went just the way they want. And I don't know if we ever saw them again. They've gone off into because that's what they want to do in the first place. But they were scanning the horizon to see who can I blame. What can I blame? I want to place some fault somewhere so that I will be excused to do the thing that I want to do. I want to let go of my standards. And so I'm trying to find some reason out there in the congregation. Sometimes I have young people and they they have something they have some fault or something. I uh my parents and my mother allows this or my father does that etc etc. Well, I don't I don't go into it to try to find out is that right? Is you mean to tell me they actually do that? Because in so doing the thing is what is the motive? What's the what's what what is the point? What is the what is the next step? Well, the next step is if the I if if they can uh if they can uh uh justify a certain degree of of fault someplace in some cases it is to relax their own or give themselves room to do something that is uh drawing aside, falling away or in plain Bible language backsliding. So what if they do? What what's the answer? What if that person does? Well, I see this young person in the church. Okay, fine. But what are you doing about it? &gt;&gt; My wife does this, my husband does that. I'm I'm I'm bearing down on this because &gt;&gt; I need to come down with a punchline at the end. So what if they do? So what if that is the case? So what if that did happen? So what if I was hated? So what if they were jealous about me? So what if they did lie about me? So what if they did say so what if I did spend time in prison over a lie? What if what &gt;&gt; Joseph was a perfect type of Christ &gt;&gt; and Christ did not engage in that. And we stand here today. You're sitting there today. You'll sing songs. You'll rejoice. You clap your hands and say it's Christ in me. &gt;&gt; You say it's the word in flesh again. &gt;&gt; Which word? &gt;&gt; The word that condemns, the word that seeks to find fault. The word that seeks to find blame, to lay blame. What kind of word lays in us? &gt;&gt; He knows nothing of that tactic. &gt;&gt; He knows nothing of that tactic. It's not in him. In fact, it's he took all the blame. &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm going to be coming to. Amen. &gt;&gt; Never said these things didn't happen. &gt;&gt; They have happened. They do happen. They will happen. They are happening. &gt;&gt; So here's the sequence. &gt;&gt; Someone said, "Well, you know, here I found some fault. I found some blame." All right. The next thing is that releases them to go the direction they want to go anyway. And then I find that that then that that shifts to another degree. It shifts into another gear and then they find fault with maybe their parents and then that extends to from their parents then to the church and then extends on from the church to the pastor and then from the pastor really in the end it's against God &gt;&gt; and that is the sequence &gt;&gt; and it can start out with such a an impetismal thing. &gt;&gt; Say that is so small but you watch it grow. &gt;&gt; You watch it grow. &gt;&gt; Joseph and I keep going back to it because it's a perfect time. &gt;&gt; Joseph could have it it could have started out. He could have said, "Well, do you remember when I had that dream? &gt;&gt; Do you remember when I had that dream?" And you fellas got so mad at me. Now, that was just a little household. That was just a little family affair. That's all it was. Look, look where it went. &gt;&gt; Look where it went. Look what happened from there on. We just had this squabble in the house. I had this dream. I thought it was spiritual. You didn't think it was spiritual. I I I really appreciate it. You hated it &gt;&gt; and you hated me for it. Now look where we are. &gt;&gt; But what would have happened if he didn't see that God was in ordering his life? Then you might sit here and say, "Oh yeah, but that's Joseph." No, he he he was on the other side of the cross and we're on this side of the cross. He was reflecting Christ there and you are reflecting Christ now. &gt;&gt; If we're not, why are we here? Why are we in this service? Why are we listening? Why are we professing the message? If we're not reflectors of Christ, and I'm trying to say this happens to be something this Christ, this son of man never engaged in. He doesn't know anything about the blame game cuz he didn't blame. He just said, "Forgive them. They don't even know what they're doing &gt;&gt; at his most crushing moment suffering as he was." I said last week and I'd like to say again, there is no valid reason for a man or a woman or believer to give up their spiritual standard their convictions, their walk with God. There's no valid reason to turn from the things of God. You will never be able to justify that in the presence of God. When we stand there to give an account, we'll never be able to say, "Well, because this happened, it turned me better." God will say, "Is that all? Does that all a knowledge? And is that all a revelation you have of Calvary? That you had opportunity to become better? You had opportunity to to say slanderous things? You had opportunity to to go the direction you went?" Now, I'm glad you're here this morning, friends. I'm glad you're all here as believers. I'm glad you're hearing. I'm glad God has dealt with me about these things. &gt;&gt; So, there's no justification for a believer to be removed. Now, one of the things that happens, are you following me thus far? One of the things that happens is when an individual finds justification to relax, maybe not turn away from the message, oh, come to church, uh call brother, sister, all the rest of it, engage in in uh the activities perhaps of the of the body of Christ. But one of the things that happens if a person relaxes from their ferveny and from their stand with God is that you are not a unit to yourself. &gt;&gt; You affect somebody. And when and when we move back from our convictions, when we move back from our standards, when we move back from our devotion to God, when we simply cool off, cool down, and it becomes evident in our lives, in our in the way we conduct ourselves, perhaps in the way we speak or our attendance to the church and the body of Christ. We had time before, we don't have time now. and and and that affects somebody else. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says this, "Thou shalt not remove thy neighbors, &gt;&gt; landmarks, &gt;&gt; you will not affect. We are not permitted &gt;&gt; in this oneness of the body of Christ. We are not permitted. No one &gt;&gt; Amen. is permitted to live in such a way so that it it it it causes someone else to go the same direction and move their landmarks. &gt;&gt; I am not permitted as a servant of Christ to live in such a way so it would cause the people or cause someone else to to loosen their standard up &gt;&gt; even though it may not be sinful. &gt;&gt; There's no sin in fishing. I could go fishing tomorrow morning. I could fish the whole week. I could be fishing right up and then come home Saturday night and say, "Oh, yes. I got to, you know, you you think that that is a I'm just I I'm just making some uh a foolish example now." No, no, no, not at all. I stood right with the pastor in a study and his associate, he says, "My associate comes in here just a few minutes before service and says, "Oh, I I got to have something." and he's flipping through his Bible to have something to go out to say and he's really leaning upon the arm of flesh because perhaps he was gifted to speak in the first place and he just wanted to catch a little note of inspiration to go out and and give it to the people. I wouldn't be sinning if I fish right up to Saturday night. But I'll tell you what, I would be setting a standard that would cause somebody else to remove their landmark. &gt;&gt; They say, "Well, our pastor does it. I can do it." and I'd removed their landmark, &gt;&gt; the landmark of your inheritance in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're all called upon of God to live in such a way so that someone else should be able to look at you and and and be moved godward, &gt;&gt; not downward. We shall not remove our neighbors landmarks. So says the scripture. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not remove thy neighbors landmark which they have of old time have set in thine inheritance. It has to do with their inheritance. And listen, it goes stronger in Deuteronomy. It has said, "Cursed be he that removeth his neighbor's landmark." And all the people, the scripture says, "shall say, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all the people shall say, &gt;&gt; "Amen. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor's landmark." &gt;&gt; In other words, it's called upon of us to live. You young men, you families, you mothers and fathers, you young ladies, we're all called upon of God to live in such a way so someone can look at you and say, "I would like to live that way. &gt;&gt; I would like to serve God that way. I would like to have that degree of devotion, that degree of dedication. They will look at you and be influenced God word &gt;&gt; and all the people shall say, &gt;&gt; "Amen." Amen. &gt;&gt; We shall not remove our neighbor's landmark. &gt;&gt; If someone wants to say, "Well, they do it." Even if that does happen, it's not justification for you or me to do it. Now the scripture says of Jesus who when he was reviled he reviled not again. When he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously. When he was reviled he reviled not again. Now there's just two aspects of the actually the ministry of the word that I will just touch on very very briefly. Last Sunday we read out of Exodus 32 where Moses was up on the mountain and the people were saying as for this Moses we don't know what happened to him. in fact is it it they were dismayed at it and the scripture in the Hebrew language simply puts it in this this is the this is the scenario. We don't know what's happened. Uh we're we're disappointed. We've been brought out here. We're embarrassed. Here we are out in this wilderness and and the man they said the man that led us out here not realizing that Moses had already told them the angel of the Lord is leading you. And right in this message, people say, "I I got something just here a few days ago came from overseas and and they start talking about the mess in the message." Well, it might be it might be by their assessment, &gt;&gt; but I see a different kind of a message. I see a glorious message. I don't see any man that has led us out into this wilderness. I see the angel of the Lord that has led us and is leading us and shall continue to lead us. I see the bride of Jesus Christ has something that is glorious in his sight. &gt;&gt; And I see that she's being taught and instructed. I thought today, have to forgive me because I'm bouncing around a wee bit, but I thought today, where would we be? Where would you be? I want you to ask yourself that. If it was not for this son of man, Jesus Christ, in the form of this coming of the word, if he had not come to you in this day, where would you be? My wife and I were just hearing uh there was actually uh one of the churches downtown and it's named after Wesley the messenger. It's called the James Wesley or Wesley Church. It's a Anglican church, I believe, a church of England. And one of their ministers is leaving. So, in celebration of his leaving of the church, they're having uh they're having something for the community. I believe it's happening either this Sunday, maybe this afternoon or next Sunday. They're having a jazz fest. just everybody and anybody who can play jazz. Just the whole they're going to have some groups and so on so forth, but it's just kind of a uh and they said hang loose. Just anybody and everybody come in and and they're going to just have a jam session the whole afternoon. Anybody who wants to play, just come and jazz it up. &gt;&gt; Well, that sounds so utterly foolish to us. &gt;&gt; But if you didn't have the strength of this word, If you didn't have the correction of this message, if we didn't have the instruction of this word, who knows where you'd be today. &gt;&gt; Who knows what we believe it? That seems so uh it seems so impossible for us to even comprehend. But I can tell you that if we if this son of man had not come our way, and when he did, when this message came your way, did he say, "You were a rat. You were a scoundrel, did he? When he approached you, said, "You remember back there? Look, look what you wear. You're a no good nothing." And he had every reason to just really rub our faces down in our failures, &gt;&gt; into our bondage. He had every reason to it. You rejected me. I called you. So, he could have said all kinds of things, but he never did do that. He never did do that because Christ does not engage in placing the blame. He places everything on delivering you from it. &gt;&gt; When you came to know Christ, when you came to know and and and if you have received a revelation, I'm talking about a divine revelation from God of what he has done in this generation. One thing is for sure, he never once pointed to your failures. Had he done so, you could not have come to a complete deliverance. He only showed you what he provided for you. He showed you. He came with such a glorious message, with such marvelous statements. &gt;&gt; You're quiet most of this service, and I think that's good. But I tell you, it would have been an unbearable experience if he'd have just started identifying our errors, our failures, our mistakes, and all that we did, &gt;&gt; our defiled condition. He'd done that, we wouldn't have been able to even rise above it. Redemption and deliverance and healing does not come that way. Now, I hope you're catching the principle. If it didn't work for us to come to salvation, how is it going to work us in the body of Christ if we try to work on that principle of, you know, finding out where the problem, where the where the blame is to be. That isn't the way he works. The way he works is this is the way. Follow me. This is the way out. This is the way to healing. This is the way to deliverance. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The gospel has been presented to you &gt;&gt; so that he can call you the blameless ones. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A few more moments, please, and I'll close. 10 minutes I'm going to close. You remember Moses come to Aaron. He said, "What have you done?" And the Bible says, and here's the two things I was going to mention about the ministry. The Bible says that Moses, I touched on it Sunday, Moses saw the nakedness of the people and he saw how Aaron had made them naked. And it's it was not nakedness in the flesh at that time. It was a nakedness which simply means a relaxation that Aaron had relaxed from uh from the the instruction of the word. He had relaxed the word that the people were living under. In other words, he gave consent for them to do what they desired to do, which was something outside of the word of God. &gt;&gt; And that made their nakedness. I'll tell you what, in this day and age, uh there's some startling things. Brother Brandham, he talks about uh the fleshly nakedness of this generation. And uh I believe it was reported I don't get a newspaper by home, but I bought one. May sometimes I think God allows me to get get one and it just so confirms where we are today. and it talked about the nakedness of women. So this is just a this is just a newspaper in Vancouver and they said in the 1950s the women were showing 9% of their body flesh on the street and they were actually taking it by a certain event that has been taking place like something down in Hollywood I guess and they said then when it got up into uh the 60s there They were showing about 30% of their flesh and now it is between over 50%. actually have the statistics and I saved the whole article. And they said they and then they said there was a couple of movie stars that came out and they wore kind of long gracious gowns and and the degree went down because the you know the popularity thing then was to follow their uh uh their example and it went back down by about 10%. But now it has it's gone up to about 59%. And they said they figure in another few years that women will be showing up to 75% of their bodies naked on the street. And you see what a prophet said about that in the 1950s. And I can tell you what he was speaking from seeing what was happening on the street. &gt;&gt; He was seeing visibly what was happening down the street. So you can say, well, so you young men, you can never say, well, it's because there's naked flesh on the street. What God has given you in this message is greater than that naked flesh. &gt;&gt; What God has given us, what God has given us in this message is greater than your broken home. You young people with single parents, this message is greater &gt;&gt; than the depravity that you've had being deprived of a father or mother. It's greater. &gt;&gt; It's greater. &gt;&gt; In the world, you may have been twisted all up and into a terrible kink, but under this message, this message came to heal the brokenhearted. You can say, "Oh, that's fine for you, Brother Biscll. I know what it is to not have a mother. I know what it is to go from pillar to post. I know what it is to live in homes as a child that didn't want me. I know what that is. &gt;&gt; I know what it is to be like the fifth wheel. I know what it is to be deprived of those things. But I also know what it is. That there's a Calvary and there's a healer that's greater than all of these disappointments. &gt;&gt; And the people said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's greater. &gt;&gt; It's greater. Amen. &gt;&gt; You single parents that are here and have brought up your children the best you know how to serve God. I say God in heaven bless you abundantly. I pass this blessing on to you. Go forward. &gt;&gt; Go upward. &gt;&gt; Continue on. &gt;&gt; God is your reward. &gt;&gt; Is Christ the answer? Is he the answer for all of it? That's great. &gt;&gt; Are we not going to continue to have terrible disappointments? Yes, there will be. Satan will tear. He will seek to tear at the lives of individuals, at the lives of people. But I say he is is futile. It's an empty vain, futile effort on his part before the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to kind of take five minutes on the last phase and that is taking all the blame. I had a couple come to me once and they met me at the back and they were very twisted up inside. They said we're we don't know how to act. You have invited uh a minister happened to be coming through and I said he'll speak in the evening service and they said this minister has treated us very very roughly. We were in his church and he has treated us very badly and we don't know how to act. We want to come to the service but we don't know how to act. And right away it may sound simple friends. It may sound simple but I tell you what it has stood this man in goodstead for a lot of years. I said right away, you'll get no place by saying, "Well, he said, and then when he said we did, and we did, and they did, and he did, and we said, and he said, I said, when we're all done, if we sorted that all out and laid the blame, and you took your part of the blame, and he took his part of the blame, what have we achieved?" &gt;&gt; Zero. &gt;&gt; A big fat zero. &gt;&gt; It will get you nowhere. a big fat zero. &gt;&gt; So I said, there's one answer that I have and it's for you to take 100% of the blame and they just looked at me. I said, "Listen, if you take 100% of the blame, that's step number one, and number two, I want you to go to him tonight, and I want you to say with all the honesty of your heart. We're sorry over what happened, and we are not here to discuss it. We're here to tell you and to ask you to forgive us. We take all the blame. I said, when you've gone to step two, what's he going to say? &gt;&gt; As a Christian, he has to say, "Yes, I forgive you." &gt;&gt; And number three, he has no place to go from there. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is tutti &gt;&gt; the end of the subject. &gt;&gt; It's all over and out. &gt;&gt; But someone said, "Well, what if we aren't to blame? Take it anyway." &gt;&gt; I read about Joseph, didn't I? &gt;&gt; I read about Joseph. Isn't that what he did? He said, "It's not your fault. &gt;&gt; It's not your fault. &gt;&gt; You didn't do it. You didn't send me here to Egypt. God sent me here &gt;&gt; in the situation you are. Are you big enough? Is God big enough for you to say God permitted it or I would I am a child of God. I am a son of God. I'm a daughter of God. He saw every area of my life. He saw every step that I took. And God knows exactly where I sit right today. And I I I'm going to give him all the credit and all the glory and give Satan none. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He took all the blame. &gt;&gt; In the spirit of Christ, he didn't just take it to go through an exercise. He didn't take it to condemn himself. &gt;&gt; He took all the blame. Maybe some of you wonder how in the world that would ever work. But it does work. Let me close in a couple of minutes. I'm just trying to close and I'm really shortening things up. You know, I started last Sunday with Adam and how they passed the buck. Brother said they passed the buck. Said, "Well, the woman that you gave me." But in the final analysis, in the final analysis, I'm going to read you a quote in a moment. You have to really think this one over. In the final analysis, there was something within Adam that was determined to assume responsibility for his wife. All the responsibility. All the responsibility. Brother Brandham says one place that when the serpent came and she was sown with that seed, he said Adam took her quickly to himself. &gt;&gt; He took her quickly to himself and swed her with the seed out of his body knowing that God couldn't destroy her when a part of him was now in her. &gt;&gt; He knew he came from God. He was a son of God and he put her and he took assumed full responsibility for her and took her quickly to himself. &gt;&gt; Now here's what here's what the prophet said in Ephesians church age. Listen now, the word teaches us that if a woman leaves her husband and goes with another man, she's an adulteress and is no longer married and the husband is not to take her back. That word was true in Eden as it was true when Moses wrote it in the law. Now, do not take just a part of this &gt;&gt; quote. It was true in Eden as it was true when Moses wrote the law. The word can't change. Adam took her back. They said, "Man, can't take her back." Says, "Adam took her back." He knew exactly what he was doing. But he did it anyway. &gt;&gt; She was a part of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he was willing to take her responsibility upon himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; He would not let her go. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; You see, it was a disastrous thing that took place, but he would not let her go. He said, "So Eve conceived by him." He knew she would. He knew exactly what would happen to the human race and he sold the human race into sin that he might have Eve for he loved her. &gt;&gt; That's a powerful powerful statement. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he took the thing that caused him to take her to himself and pregnant her was in taking her to himself, he preserved her. &gt;&gt; I hope you're spiritual enough to pinch your conscience. Now, this one that was the second Adam, he was Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago walking here. And he could say to a woman, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more." &gt;&gt; And all that they said, "Who sinned? This man or his parents?" He said, "No one." if they were all born in sin. &gt;&gt; But he was saying as far as approaching him, no one sinned, but that the name that God we may be glorified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God is glorified in deliverance. &gt;&gt; God is glorified in in his healing power. I'm not talking about healing of the bodies now. I'm talking about healing in the in the realm that I'm speaking of today. And when this son of man, listen closely now. When this same Christ came through this generation &gt;&gt; and begin to walk amongst the children of men &gt;&gt; and found you, &gt;&gt; in your pit, &gt;&gt; found you in your death, &gt;&gt; found you wallowing in your condition. &gt;&gt; He didn't even spend one moment &gt;&gt; trying to decipher where you were. and the dark places you had been and the sin you engaged in and the rebellion in your heart and the hardness and the rejection and on and on and on. How he could have gone. He never even spent one instant. He said, "Come unto me. All ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Come unto me and you'll find deliverance." But if for a moment you try to f oh where my fault, their fault, my parents' fault, this one's fault, some preachers's fault, some church's fault, you stay where you are. But when you say, "I forgive all of that. I turn my back on that. I have now been I have now come into the very presence of the of God himself." &gt;&gt; And when that son of man came to you, Amen. &gt;&gt; I look across this congregation and my mind races as I think the many places that you have been and how Satan has taken to tear and nash at our lives and to try to destroy us but he could not succeed. &gt;&gt; The greater one came. The greater one came &gt;&gt; and he said, "I will take all the faults." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will take all the pain. I will take all your nakedness. I will take all your failures. I will take it all. You bear none of it anymore. &gt;&gt; You have none of it. You may wonder why people rejoice. They rejoice because they experienced it. &gt;&gt; They rejoice because they know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; I take it all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I take it all. &gt;&gt; Here's one standing here today. Even as I as a human, if I was a your friend, and a friend indeed, if I could take it all and send you out with a healed life. Oh, wouldn't I do that if I was a friend? But here's one that stands here today. It is the word of God made flesh again in the form of the son of man, Jesus Christ, in the second coming, letting the bride know, you never did it in the first place. And I take it all. I take it all, &gt;&gt; all your shame, &gt;&gt; all your failure and that of anyone else that was associated with your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anyone else whose pathway whose footsteps cross yours, I take them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And by coming, friends, my dear ones in Christ, by coming to you, by coming to you, &gt;&gt; listen, he was actually taking and putting his arms around you and pulling you to himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; And in that act, no fault, no blame, no shame because he was taking it all and he pulled you into himself and pregnantated you with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you are saved. &gt;&gt; You are saved &gt;&gt; for time and eternity. his very act of of coming to you and and the very act of Adam taking her to himself saved her. &gt;&gt; He did not try to lay blame or fault. And had he, we could never been healed. &gt;&gt; We could never have come to know what we've known. Maybe some of you God will deal with you. Maybe there's some of you and it'll have to be of God. There may be somebody here. You could only do so by the spirit of God. But you may be directed to go to someone say I don't know the grace that I've received I now give &gt;&gt; and the things that have taken place they are now passed and before God who forgave Hey, I now take 100% of the blame in this blame game. To me, that is the most glorious thing &gt;&gt; one came to you said, I will take it all. Satan would like to keep his toe in the door by saying, "Yeah, but you you were to blame. You did do some things. You did let you did you did you did and as long as you allow him that, it'll be you won't have a you won't have a complete deliverance." &gt;&gt; But when you say it's over, it's finished and it's gone. &gt;&gt; I am delivered. I am forgiven. &gt;&gt; Then you'll understand what these scriptures are all about when he says these things. Just listen to me now. that he might present it, the church, you the people to himself. &gt;&gt; A glorious church. &gt;&gt; Say it. Glorious church. &gt;&gt; Say it once again. A glorious church. &gt;&gt; Not having spot or wrinkle. Satan would like to have you say, "I know I've got a lot of spots. I got a lot of wrinkles. I got a lot of failures. I got a lot of places where there should be some blame and I could be condemned over it." But our Lord Jesus Christ took that blame. He took that shame. He took your fault upon himself. And even if you might say, "I do have fault. I do have we have an area where I've allowed Satan to come into my life." Then God is offering you the opportunity to turn aside, slam the door on him. &gt;&gt; God has given us the opportunity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said to the spotless without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without &gt;&gt; blemish, &gt;&gt; without blame, without blemish of any kind. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, what what is Christ going to do? &gt;&gt; Say, well, I brought a church. Yeah, 68 million martyrs. Many of them were victorious and so on. They wouldn't deny the name of Christ. But when it come to Leodysia, didn't work. &gt;&gt; Just didn't work. That old serpent that crawled in Eden, he just overpowered it again. Just deceived her again. A prophet came and declared under the vindication of God that this Eve, this bride cannot be deceived. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you can't be deceived, it means you were made for the truth. &gt;&gt; You've been designed for the truth. &gt;&gt; And that's why all of those other things couldn't register with you. Your heart and soul could not say amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz you were made for the truth. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm trying to close. Brother Brandham is a musician's come. Brother Brandham, you've read about this, but I want to hear I want you to hear it in this context. All you young ladies, listen. Everyone listen. But she was a young woman and he went into an insane institution. He said the people were in their straight jackets and he knew he was there now to pray for a person and he came in and there was a beautiful young woman. She was sitting there and uh he said, "How do you do?" She said, "How do you do, Reverend Brand or Mr. Brham?" He said, "Uh, Brother Bam said, well, I don't really know where to start because you just in this big place. I don't know really where to start." And she says, "Well, how about starting with me?" He said, "You are you a patient here?" She said, "Yes." He said, "She was a beautiful young woman. would have made anybody a real fine sweetheart as a as a wife. And he said, "Well," he said to her, "That's fine for the insane the situation they were in." She said, "That's what I am. And she said, "Would you listen to my story?" He said, "Certainly." I was about I was raised in a Christian home. Many of you young people, she was raised in a Christian home. I started going with a boy that smoked and drank. And one night there was a spiked drink given to her. Not exactly with something to knock her out, but with something that she didn't Well, he said it was something and then an immoral act. And she thought she'd throw her life away. She became an alcoholic. She became a prostitute. She was picked up and sent to the good shepherd's home. when she was only about 15 years old, a Catholic institution, she changed her religion from what she was to a Catholic. Came back out, thought she'd be all right. And the same thing happened again. Then she was picked up. She was getting of age then and sent and spent two years in the woman's penitentiary. And there they thought they had fixed it all right then and said when she came out she said the same thing again started right over again. And I said well now lady you're just trying to turn a new leaf. That won't work. So a new leaf won't work. Trying won't work. said, "I want to ask you something." He said, "Don't you and never expect to be married and a pretty woman like you and have a husband and babies like any normal woman?" And she said, "Yes, but who would have me?" She said, "What could I promise a man?" said, "I got a I get temper fits that I'd fight and swear and drink and said I get on a drunk and wouldn't come home for a month." Said, "What would a man want with a woman like me?" And I said, "He wouldn't." But I said, "Did you ever think that instead of being just something as a a school or turning over a new leaf or something, something could help you?" He said, "It's a devil." Now, the church couldn't help her. Religion couldn't help her. The penitentiary couldn't help her. The good shepherd's home couldn't help her. Turning over a new leaf couldn't help her. But now he's talking about something. Before he can talk about health, he has to talk about the problem. The problems is the devil. &gt;&gt; People today are tempted to say, "I'm a manic depressant." It's a devil. &gt;&gt; And today they've got all kinds of medications that give you only take you further away, make you reliant on some medication. It's a devil. &gt;&gt; You have to start where the problem is. &gt;&gt; They say, "Well, here just take this pill or take that medication. take this. That's just that's not even turning over a new leaf. &gt;&gt; Does this congregation say amen? &gt;&gt; And she said, "Mr. Brandom, I've always believed that." She said, "And now they say I'm a delinquent person." And I said, "Don't believe it." &gt;&gt; Oh, she never had anyone say that to her before. They say I'm delinquent. They say I'm insane. He said, "Don't believe it." &gt;&gt; She could have said, "The walls tell me that." The people here tell me that. The people who got them in a in straight jackets, they they I've got a lot of evidence I'm insane. He don't believe it. It's the devil. Oh, I thank God for this glory of this wondrous way of the gospel. I thank God for the power of the cross of Jesus Christ. It has to start someplace. You don't believe it. &gt;&gt; They've told me this and they've told me that and I've been analyzed and I've been to this counselor and I've been to that pastor. I've been to this church, but I still have this thing. Number one, don't believe it. &gt;&gt; It's the devil. [Music] &gt;&gt; You try to fix it and turn over new leaf, it won't work. said, 'I've always believed that. I said, 'n now, the only way, the only way, the only way to get rid of this devil is in prayer. &gt;&gt; It's not talking to somebody on the phone or sending somebody an email. It's by prayer. &gt;&gt; The only way to get rid of this devil is by prayer. &gt;&gt; Does the congregation say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; I want you to say it from the bottom of your bootstraps. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the gospel of Jesus Christ. We are glorifying the cross of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'm over my time by a long ways, but I'm going to throw the clock away. &gt;&gt; I feel the power of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; God's going to bring victory. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Let's get down and pray." And there's been many times people got around here and prayed. And I prayed. I prayed earnestly while they didn't say a word and I knew in my heart no deliverance can come. They must pray. &gt;&gt; They must repent. I I can't repent for anybody. You can't repent for me. We repent for ourselves. &gt;&gt; And then deliverance comes. &gt;&gt; And she prayed. And she prayed there a while. I prayed with her. You'd think that would be sufficient for anything? And she looked up and she said, "Oh, Mr. Brandom, I believe I'm going out of here to be a different girl." And I said, "No, no, you're not. You're going out of here to be the same way you came in." See, you're just simply taking it on a mental conception. &gt;&gt; You're just feeling I can do it now. No. And this is where all kinds of people may be sitting right here. You've been to that spot. &gt;&gt; Oh, you just heard something that's so sturdy up. I'm going to be different. I'm going, I can never be the same. You go down the road a little ways a week or two and you're exactly the same. You know why? Number one, you didn't deal with it as being a devil. &gt;&gt; So, well, I'm just depressed or I'm just this or I'm something else. It's a devil. &gt;&gt; And you got to resist the devil. &gt;&gt; Recognize it. &gt;&gt; Tell you what, my brother, my sisters, the word of God is sharper than any two-edged sword. &gt;&gt; Some of you have had the same thing. You've had a repeat and a repeat and a repeat and a repeat. It's a devil that causes you to do that. Yeah, you got to get rid of him. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just feel a spirit of warfare upon me. I want to go out and see. Are you delivered? &gt;&gt; Don't give any way to the devil. &gt;&gt; It's the devil that causes us to be less than what we ought to be in Christ. &gt;&gt; So, you're simply taking on a mental conception. And I said, "You've got to get down to business, sister, with God." And we got down and started praying. And after a while, she struck something. &gt;&gt; Then she turned and the tears running down her cheeks out of them big brown eyes. And she said, "Brother Brandham, I'll never do that again." Oh, she found something then. &gt;&gt; She's married now. She's got two or three children. She's never drank from that day since. She's never smoked. See, something happened. &gt;&gt; He called that young man a modernday Judas. In context with the service, Brother Brandham had ample reason to start to counsel her. Well, you see, young woman, where it started, that's where you should have resisted, right back there. You should have never gone with that young man. He could have gone on and on and on. She'd been nothing but a dejected failure, abject failure. And he had every reason like Joseph had with his brethren. He could have pointed all of her sin and her trouble. She didn't need to hear about her failure. She needed to know there was a way out. &gt;&gt; She didn't need to hear this will probably just happen again. She needed to hear this will never happen again. Uh Christ is here. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So glad &gt;&gt; there was someone that took all the blame. &gt;&gt; A song has been going through my mind and I haven't even any voice left. Uh maybe we could take the microphone to my wife. You don't want to. Can you get a microphone? You know it. [Music] Can I have a microphone on those? I'd like one of those. [Music] You made lots with your plates and lots of [Music] wait for a moment. [Music] It was his love for me that nailed him to the tree. [Music] to die in agony, [Music] &gt;&gt; my sin. For my own guilt and pain, blame, the great redeemer came, willing to bear my shame. of all my sin. Oh, what a savior is mine. In him, God's mercies combined. His love will never decline. and he loves me to Calvar's hill. One day the Lord was led away. None else the price could pay for all my sin. He on the cross was slain. Yielding his life in pain, he felt the bitter stain of all my sin. The next verse. Was ever love so strong? [Music] Was ever crime so wrong? When Jesus suffered long for all my sin, he saw my greatest need, became my friend indeed. Through him I have been freed of all all my sin. Sing it with us. Oh, what a savior is mine. God's mercies combined. His love and ever decline. And he loves me. Why don't we stand and we'll sing it through. Brother Jason helping please. &gt;&gt; It was his love for me that nailed him to the tree to die in agony for all my sin. For my own guilt and blame, the great redeemer came, willing to bear the shame of all my sins. Oh, what a savior is mine. In him, God's mercies combined. His love can never decline. And he loves me to Calary's hill. One day the Lord was led away. None else a price could pay for all my sin. He on the cross was slain. Yielding his life in pain. He devel. [Music] Oh, what a what a savior is mine. [Music] In him, God's mercies come by and his love will never decline. and he loves me. &gt;&gt; I wonder while we're singing it if we can grasp the depth of that love. [Music] You can think of the worst and the darkest and the most horrible part of your past or your life and he loved you greater than that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can think of your greatest failure &gt;&gt; and he loved you more than that. He loved you more than that. He loved you beyond that. And that today, my brother, my sister, is our example. And I want to preach another service. It won't be on this subject, but it'll be extended from this subject. And it is this that we follow in his steps. &gt;&gt; As I have done, so do ye. &gt;&gt; As I have done, &gt;&gt; you follow. And the people said &gt;&gt; as he did as the example, you do it &gt;&gt; and God will give you glorious, marvelous success in your spiritual walk. &gt;&gt; And the people said, &gt;&gt; "I want to know that you believe it." Was [Music] ever love so strong? Was ever crime so wrong? And Jesus suffered long for all my sin. He saw my greatest need. He became my friend in need. Through him I have been free of all my sins. Sing it in victory now. Oh what a Savior is mine. In him God's mercies combine. His love will never decline. [Music] [Applause] And he loves me. Oh, what a savior is my in God's mercies. His love can never be. and he loves us free. We thank you matchless savior [Music] for this undying unchanging love and how you have spoken the word in such intensity in such strength to our individual hearts that we can have the absolute assurance and confidence that we lay before you blameless and without blemish. And in so confessing we lift up the power of the cross. We agree to the complete of the completeness of Calvary. We agree that that the words that you spoke it is finished indeed are true. That is done. Lord, as we are drawing to a close of this service and will depart this place, we'll return after a short time of rest and nourishment. I ask that your Holy Spirit will so take, oh God, the thoughts, take these things only as the Holy Spirit can speak them to the individual heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Lord, may each life be directed so sovereignly and guided by the Holy Spirit, oh God, in the thing that they should do &gt;&gt; and the way that they should believe. And Lord, perhaps there it was a it was a very broad subject across a great scope of our our lives. Someone needs to say, &gt;&gt; "It's the devil." Amen. &gt;&gt; And they need to deal with it in such a way. &gt;&gt; Someone needs to say, "I take all the blame. I will take it all." And that way fellowship is restored. And that way no one has to try to seek to find where the fault lies. But I take all the blame, oh God. And someone needs to say, "I reject this condemnation that Satan tries to lay upon me. I reject it. This is not the plan of God. And someone needs to say, "I'm done with shifting this. I'm done with shifting this elsewhere, on someone else, on someplace else." Lord, I acknowledge my own failings and recognize what I heard this morning is my only answer, my only solution. And now I regard that you took it to Calvary. You took it all to Calvary, and I don't have to deal with it anymore. Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray, Father, that you'll take the congregation this morning. I want to know while we're praying and our heads are bowed. Maybe you want to raise your hand and I identify. Say, I identify with a certain aspect of this service today. God knows. I know. I lift my hand and say, God, you take over. What I have tried doesn't work, but I want you to take over. I want you to take absolute control of my life and every dictate every part of it in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, with hands raised, with hearts lifted up, with our faces looking heavenward, we are asking you to take charge of our lives. Oh God, we know and we have an absolute assurance that your undying caring for us and love for us will guide us through these waters of this age that we are in. Lord, I pray that you'll take the words now and let it be branded on our hearts for your glory and we'll give you all the praise in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Hallelujah. I've been long longer than I wanted to be. So, I'm just going to dismiss you in the name of Jesus Christ. You've you've heard what you've heard. You've planted it deep in your heart. And I always find that God has a continuity of thought that he has a has a mind in this in the s services and the series that we've been having. And I believe that it's for us at this time. And if you just remember the very first quote I read, let us not go out and just be the same persons we were. Let it let the influence of the Holy Spirit make those changes that need to. It may not apply to everyone. If it doesn't apply to you, we're fine. But take those make those changes and say, "God, here I am. You take me and do what you would do with me. I'm I'm entirely surrendered to you." Amen. And the people said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name.
