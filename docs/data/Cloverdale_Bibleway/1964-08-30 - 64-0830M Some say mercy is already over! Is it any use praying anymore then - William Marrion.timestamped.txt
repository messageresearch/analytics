[0:00] brother Bram some say Mercy is over and
[0:04] no one can be saved now is this trueth
[0:08] I'm glad I got this one we watch and
[0:11] pray we watch the prayer lines and it
[0:15] seems some are
[0:18] still uh finding Mercy now that's the
[0:22] first question you got too is Mercy over
[0:26] don't never think that see just keep
[0:30] right on doing everything you can until
[0:32] you're taken away see we notice in a
[0:35] prayer line some finds Mercy sure
[0:38] Mercy's the doors are open see I think
[0:41] where you got this uh this thought might
[0:44] lay between see I don't have time to
[0:46] give each one of these scriptures are
[0:47] right place you see each one of these
[0:48] things the right place the in the prayer
[0:52] line you find Mercy certainly if I know
[0:55] Jesus is coming this afternoon I'd be
[0:57] doing just the thing I'm doing right now
[1:00] just continuing right on Mercy is always
[1:02] open see and now where I think you get
[1:04] it is about the finishing of the seven
[1:07] Church ages and the Seven Seals being
[1:10] loosed see the Seven Seals it's
[1:13] manifested what takes place have what
[1:16] has took place the seventh Church age
[1:18] where the end of the seventh Church age
[1:20] when I say the end that doesn't mean
[1:23] it's this very hour this very minute
[1:25] remember the Bible said back in the
[1:28] times of of the Lord Jesus Paul said for
[1:30] the time is at hand amen do you realize
[1:35] how long that was in God's time that was
[1:38] yesterday my time has been 2,000 years
[1:42] see the time is at hand see what God
[1:46] calls at hand is not what we call at
[1:48] hand see so Just Keep On Believing keep
[1:51] on praying keep on uh God still got
[1:54] Mercy open just keep flowing into it as
[1:56] fast as you can God will do the Stop and
[1:58] when it's time to stop see but in the
[2:00] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[2:02] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[2:04] of God should be finished as he hath
[2:07] declared to his servants the prophets
