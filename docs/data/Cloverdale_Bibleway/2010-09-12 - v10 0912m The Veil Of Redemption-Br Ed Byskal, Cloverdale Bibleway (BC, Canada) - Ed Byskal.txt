Those of you made your way with us, God bless you. Trust you feel welcome. If you see someone you don't know, go up, shake their hand, say, "God bless you." And those who are also streaming with us, we just trust that you would feel the same presence wherever you're at. I have one announcement on the street. There's a red Mercury van license plate Washington license plate 921 SCU. Your lights are on. So, if you'd like to be able to go anywhere after the service, I'd encourage you to make your way out and take care of that. Amen. Our sister Hedi Kasanti is going to come and bless us with a song. Maybe as she does, why don't we sing in everything, give him thanks. In the good times, praise his name. In the bad times, we're going to do the same. Amen. Amen.

Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; It's a pleasure. It's a privilege for us to be able to open our mouths and to be here with the saints of God and to give him glory. I was praying this morning, Lord, I just ask that you'll be pleased. &gt;&gt; Don't be grieved, but be pleased. We don't want to do anything to grieve him, but we want him to be pleased. May he be pleased with our uh attendance here today, with the word that is spoken, with the songs that are sung, and with the worship. And I know that you're doing it from the bottom of your heart. I'll just have you have your seats for a few moments. Uh our brother Daniel was Yes. Right here. Our brother Daniel was in Congo and uh in the future we'll have future days. I don't know just when he's uh getting together with brother Aaron Hardy and they're going to try to put together some of the some of the pictures which have been prepared. Uh but this uh this just took place. Brother Daniel just got back and the convention uh in in Kinshasa with brother Dioa and uh the other brethren was August the 22nd to the 31st. So it just concluded. But I think that it would be good for us to know a little bit about it. These are people you're going to spend eternity with. And I think that we can learn from uh one another. Uh I was I was greatly moved by the uh by a some of the not slides merely but some of the video and uh it's just impossible for us to be there. We just can't do that. I was supposed to be there and I just was not able to go. I felt very very bad about it. uh seven seven days of the 10 days of the convention were concentrated for ministers. Uh they they started out the convention with I won't name the countries because there are many many countries uh from Africa and Europe and even some from United States. Uh there were 2,200 guests that started out with 2,200 ministers. These are not the congregation. These are ministers that were registered and uh the services went on for the seven days. Uh brother do brother Dioa spoke uh several of those days. Brother Nanda Chedetti from the island of Maitius spoke on Sunday the 29th. Brother Peter from New York, I'm not sure I'm acquainted with the brother, but he spoke on Monday. and brother Caillou covered the subject of the sovereignty of the local church and a local ministry. Uh and uh then they took a portion of the service on the deity of Christ who is the only true God and the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Brother Kadima from South Africa spoke on the seventh seal showing the deity of Christ in the revelation revelation 10. Uh and then brother Dioa preached on the religion of Nimrod and was that was the first person to be worshiped as God. And it's a it sound like a really a tremendous meeting. uh during the convention, at the end of the convention, there were uh 3,737 ministers. Uh it's not good enough for us just to hear about it, but I hope that we're affected by it. And these guests uh were ministers in particular and believers from the four corners of the world. They were fed, lodged, transported by believers of Shakina Tabernacle who barely make $200 a month for their work, their salary. Brother Daniel said, "I saw sisters giving themselves to the work of God. Some of them could come from 6:00 a.m. in the morning till 12 midnight or just to receive just to receive and welcome the guests. Parents gave their home their rooms to have ministers sleep in there. Those who were unable to do so tried to rent a place to host as many ministers as they could support. The few brothers that have cars gave them gave their away their cars for the work. And sometimes they had to drive back and forth driving the ministers back and forth by supporting themselves and the cost of gasoline and other expenses. young children. I hope all you children are listening. They worked overnight through the night to help clean the church and move seats for the next service because we had service in two places, two different locations. and the new the new site where the uh and the old church both were being used for the meetings. There are so many sacrifices from believers in the Congo to have the convention to be done so perfectly. And like I said, brother Daniel speaking, 3,737 or more were supported by what we call today the poorest persons in the world. I can only see God in that. And it's not the work of a man. &gt;&gt; This wasn't uh this wasn't a 10 days of socializing. &gt;&gt; This was 10 days of sacrifice. We've got quite a number of Congalles people in this church and some that have come from Seattle today and incidentally we're having communion tonight. Uh this afternoon the service will be 4:00. But I would like to say to you of the Congolese community don't seek to adopt our ways but seek to convert us to your ways. I admire and uh desire more the sacrifice or the life of sacrifice to open a person's home to make a bed available to be hospitable or be addicted to hospit to hospitality as the scripture said of one brother and uh uh and I I made the statement this was not socializing we you know we can invite people and socialize. But that's really not what we're talking about here. We're talking about sacrifice. We're talking about sacrifice to achieve something that God is pleased with. And uh I would say that the curse in this Leodysian age is individualism. We're satisfied to be enclosed and and uh uh I realize we can't change everything here, but we can struggle against it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I have very few amens on that. &gt;&gt; We can struggle against it. &gt;&gt; And I think we need to struggle against it. We need to try to break down those barriers. And I know whenever we get invited or go to someone's place and uh we sit and sang, I know, brother Nathan and Sister Deborah here, we've been to their place two, three times and you know, they pull out the instruments or the guitars or whoever is there and we sing and we worship and and uh yes, we it is socializing to a a to a a degree, but that's not the intent. The intent is to edify one another and benefit one another. And when I get around these people, when I go overseas, excuse me, now you're, you know, I I have been many, many, many, many countries, somewhere between 45 and 50 countries. But one of the things I try to do is be a good listener. And one of the things I I have a habit of doing, I ask people, "How did you come to the message? How did God begin to deal with you?" I'm much more interested in hearing that than I am telling them, you know, what I know or what I've learned or whatever more. And when, you know, when I've heard the testimonies of some of these people that are just so poor and simple believers, I feel about that big when they're speaking. The thing that God has allowed them to experience. And you know, when I walk away, I feel enriched. &gt;&gt; I really feel enriched. I feel built up. And so I I don't want you to consider that um you know a negative here. I mean we we can't change things. &gt;&gt; The economy is what the economy is. But we can war against it. &gt;&gt; We can war against the uh you know the things that take away from what could make our life rich. Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, you you just you just put it to the test and you'll find you you can't do it if God doesn't open the door. But when he does and when there's an opportunity, and I believe that at every opportunity, we should try to uh be a blessing to God's people. As much as you've done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren, you have done it unto who? &gt;&gt; Me. speaking of Christ, you've done it unto me. Uh the saints there are building a a a building a building is it's not like building standards over here, but it's a very very uh very very fine uh structure and it has to be safe and all the rest of it. Uh, but they've got about seven I think it say six or seven hectares. That'll be about 14 15 12 14 acres. And uh uh the building that they're putting up hopefully will be will handle about uh 12,000 people. And I can tell you they're going to pretty closely to fill that. If you see the pictures, it really remarkable. Must be touching for you, brother Daniel, to go back and be part of it. So now you Congalles people take it serious and convert us. Bring us to your level of sacrifice and hallelujah. We might start today by me having a long service congal style. Let's remember brother Murphy. Now there's a brother right from our midst that's sacrificing. He just arrived. He arrived in Shenzen and just went immediately after a terrible long trip went immediately into meetings right after the meetings. Uh took a bus trip for eight hours where they were waiting for to go right into services again. And so when you see them come back and they're look we're worn out they it's it's for a good cause for good reason. It is it is in truth. And so that's how the message is going and excuse me in whatever part we're able to play. That's that's why I feel so privileged when we're not able to even begin to convey to you. If we did it would sound like we're just going from one meeting to the other with the report. We haven't heard from brother Victor Adamora who's been in Nigeria and Ghana and that part of Africa. Uh we've scarcely heard we've heard from brother Tom a little bit about Siberia. Brother Milco just came back from uh the saints uh in Israel and Hub Station has gone there. uh brother brother Tim Puit and brother Ron Spencer and maybe another brother are are now having plans to go to uh to Uganda and they've they've called and asked brother Kim Dingwal that he would go and another church in the eastern states is going to bring buy some uh some of the print stations, the hub stations and they're going to ship them and get them over there and they want brother Kim to instruct the people and train young men and then he'll probably maybe go by brother um uh to Kenya and and uh be there with brother Oadia. There's just so much is taking place. I am thankful friends &gt;&gt; that I'm not just sitting in a church enjoying a service. I want to be and I think we all want to be active. You say well how can I? Well, one thing you can do is get on your knees and prevail before God. Strengthen those brothers and bless them. And number two, open doors for me so I can be something more than just a average American or average Canadian. I want to open my heart and open my home and open up my uh pocketbook and whatever I need to do. We're not we're not you know you know us here. We're not pulling on money. But when we have an opportunity to do good to the children of God, let's let's do all that we can for only one life. It will soon be passed and only what's done for Christ will last. &gt;&gt; Amen. heard about the service, brother John, on Friday night and uh and how they had things set up and couple hundred people out on Friday, uh combining a prayer meeting and uh brother Kyle spoke about the prayer meeting and how it was kind of merging with the witness and that had taken place at the Lynen booth and uh and the people that were touched and some of our young people here, two or three of them just on their own, went out on the streets and printed several hundred books uh maybe from the hub station, I don't know, and handed and they were all given out. I just say, "Praise God. &gt;&gt; Stir it up." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let the name of the Lord be glorified. &gt;&gt; Let the message give the winds a mighty voice. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. All right. Should we pray about anything else? Well, we could pray that the rain stops so that that hole out there doesn't turn into a swimming pool. We don't need one. All right. God bless you. It's lovely to see you and have you here. Let's stand and we're going to read the word. Before we do, we'll have a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, as our spirits are quietened before you, we pray that the Holy Spirit will come and prepare our prepare our hearts, prepare the ground that your seed will fall into good ground and bring forth fruit. Lord, we pray it'll bring forth a hundfold. Lord Jesus, I pray that your name will be glorified. It was the name that was given. It's the name that's above every name. It's the name that we all have received and have been baptized in. We thank you for that glorious name. And we pray, oh God, that you will today move about this entire congregation of people out on the internet. Lord, those that are streaming at this time, their heads are bowed praying with us. Move into those rooms by the Holy Spirit. And may there be an atmosphere created, oh father, that will be a benefit to the bride of Jesus Christ. We need to be strengthened, Lord. Satan is waring against us in every possible way that he can. But I pray that you will give us such a unmovable, unshakable faith, oh God, that nothing can move us, Lord. Pray that you will bless this day and bless the service tonight, Lord, and the communion and the foot washing. bless I pray every activity and those that participate and we're all here to participate now in the name of Jesus Christ we ask that the spirit of revelation will be our portion Lord let us see things that will strengthen us I pray in the name of Jesus and for your glory amen &gt;&gt; amen I'll have you turn in the Bible to John the 3 chapter and we'll read from verse one And then we're going to read from Romans 7 uh three or four verses there. Starting with uh verse one of John 3. There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. The same came to Jesus by night and said unto him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God, for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him." Jesus answered and said unto him, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, &gt;&gt; he cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus said unto him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?" And Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit." And then in Romans 7th chapter, we're going to read from verse 18. For I know, Paul speaking here, for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing. For to will is present with me. In other words, he has a desire. For to will is present with me, but how to perform it or how to do it. That which is good I find not. For the good that I would, I do not. But the evil which I would not that I do. And I think we all could say amen. That that's our experience. Now if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me. I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me. God bless his word and bless you as you have your seats. Um, I have a Scoffield Bible. In fact is I didn't know until I was with Brother Brandham. He saw my Bible and he said, "Oh, I see you have a Scoffield Bible." He said, "That's exactly the same Bible I carry. It's about that's about the size of it." And um, he said, "I like old Dr. Scoffield's uh, some of his notes." And I know in the message he uses some. Scofll says about the new birth. When Nicodemus was asking about it, he said the necessity of the new birth grows out of the incapacity of the natural man to see or to enter into the kingdom of God. However gifted, moral or refined, the natural man is absolutely blind to spiritual truth and impotent to enter into the kingdom. for he can neither obey, understand nor please God. &gt;&gt; That's the natural man. &gt;&gt; I thought that was good. &gt;&gt; I want to speak on the veil of redemption. and I uh we had a service in Seattle uh a couple weeks ago and we spoke on the fullness of redemption, the full redemption and I wanted to bring it uh uh to you this morning but it's uh coming from a completely different direction so the you from Seattle can can recognize perhaps little bits of it segments here and there but I want to speak on the veil of redemption. ion uh brother Brandham mentions uh in the scripture the veil of the temple excuse me please the veil of the shakina glory he speaks of the veil of the blood the veil of God the veil of his flesh speaking of Jesus Christ the veil of human flesh speaking of us the veil of sin the veil of sickness The veil of sorrow, the veil of fear, the veil of unbelief, the veil of tradition, the veil of death, the veil of the grave, the veil of mercy, and the veil of mortal kin. All of these veils. Now, there are, and I'll just bring this up on the screen for you. There are two births, one natural and one spiritual. There are two natures, a nature by each of those births. There's two books, a record of each nature. And I might just say that's the book of life, which is the book of life. And then there's the lamb's book of life. This is a dying spirit in a dying body. But now you can't be two bodies in one time. But there can be two natures in you at one time. Like in the book, Brother Brandham speaks of uh uh the the book, he speaks of the church age book, I believe, at this time. And the spot where uh there we was talking about the two books being one. The book of life, the first book of life coming up was when you were born. That was your natural birth. But then one time way back down in there, there's a little grain of life laying there which you'd wonder where did it come from? I was born of Charlton Ella Brandom. In their nature, I was a sinner. I come to the world a liar and all the habits of the world laid right in me. But down in there too was another nature present. Predestinated was in there by God in this same body. Two natures in there. &gt;&gt; Thank God for that seed. That predestinated seed. But really frankly, he said, "We have never seen each other. We have never seen one another." You hear something speaking out of a body here that impersonates whatever is on the inside. So then when we talk to each other, we're really not talking to the body. It's the spirit inside, but the body is the thing that identifies the spirit that's on the that's on the inside. And then brother Brandham speaks of every thought and every act and every deed that is recorded. And there's a there's a a a quote out of God's power to transform. Is it all right? They just lay this foundation. &gt;&gt; We each one come down to the end of the road where we're going to give an account for every word. When we're born, our first little cry goes out on a tape. It's going to be played back again at the day of judgment. Even the clothes you wear will be showed in your face at the day of judgment. Even science has found that by television, television doesn't manufacture a picture, it only channels it. The color of clothes, every time you move, every thought in your mind is absolutely kept on God's record. And that big thing uh will be laid right before you. every one of them filthy dresses you wore. Every time you went to the barber shop, cut the cut that hair that God gave you, it's going to be you'll answer for it. Uh you can't make a move right there. Just even the thoughts of your heart uh while you're doing it will be played right before you. How are you going to escape? How shall we escape if we neglect? Notice this now. How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? We're not going to escape. Every move and the thought of the heart is recorded right in another dimension. Even the color of the clothes you wear. Now, brother Brandham talks about when you get the book once again, you're going to see maybe a little confusion there of what I said. Now, Brother Brandham is saying here in the quote, I just that everyone everything's recorded. Now, we're going to brother Bram speaking about the book. You're going to see maybe a little confusion there of what I said the two books of life. It's the same book, but one of them is your natural birth. The other one is your spiritual birth. One leads out to the other one just like a stock of wheat. Whenever you talk to me, you talk to me as a living person. But there's a part of me here is that person that must perish. That's the that's the book that the name comes off of. But the eternal one, the predestinated one, the elected one, the name never can come from uh never can come from there because it was always on it. It can never be taken off. Continuing in the invisible union. Now your old book is gone with your old union. And now your name in your old in your has been transferred. Now you say, "Do you mean to tell me that the old book God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness?" You stand perfectly before God. Now your name is now in the new book, not in the book of life, but in the lamb's book of life. What the lamb redeemed, not the old book of your your natural union, but your new bride. Hallelujah. Your new life is in the lamb's book of life. Your marriage certificate. Hallelujah. Where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold, I believe is what it says. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we just have the lights. That's all we're going to have of that for now. Apostle Paul said, and I need to lay all of this broad uh base out, and you listen very close. Apostle Paul said,"For I know that in me which I read, in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing. For to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not." So he speaks of the of the natural flesh and the waring one with the other. And I want to say that there's a I want to present it this way that there's a veil uh uh between this flesh. In other words, here we are as individuals and we don't know one another. We don't really see one another. We uh in fact is before I'm done this service, you're going to be glad that you have this veil of flesh because you wouldn't want your neighbor or anyone in this church or anyone that you are seated with. We would not want what the prophet of God said, every cry, every word, every thought. Who wants that spread on a screen? Right. &gt;&gt; And if I had your book or you had my book or anybody had your book of life &gt;&gt; that and the way God records it, you would say have mercy. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, have mercy. Don't make that public. Don't uh you know don't uh uh surv allow me to survive this moment. Who wants their natural life? Now friends, this is not poetic language. This is exactly the Bible. &gt;&gt; Your deeds, your thoughts, every movement, every action, every thought. And that's why the apostle Paul in this flesh there is no good thing. There isn't anyone who can boast of what they've done in the flesh. Anything that you've done in the flesh that is of any consequence, you can only thank God for it. &gt;&gt; Because even when we would do good, the will, we have a will to do good, but we can't find how to do it. &gt;&gt; We can't find how to perform it unless there's another power, another life that that allows us or gives us an opportunity. So in this flesh dwells no good thing. And there's the the this flesh is a veil. The prophet says it's a veil. This and you we're we're thankful in this natural life that there is this natural veil of this flesh. Quite frankly, I don't want anybody to even have any any access to my thoughts or your thoughts. We just don't want them to have access to it. And and We were born in sin and shapen in iniquities and come into the world speaking lies. friends, in order to see the greatness and of Calvary, in order to see the marvelous things that God has done for us, and I will become very specific in it in a few moments, but I find that the reason why a lot of people can't rejoice in the deliverance because they haven't really seen how profoundly bound they were. Amen. &gt;&gt; Evil and sin is very sinful. &gt;&gt; And there's no such a thing as a white lie or or just some little thing or that's some little infraction. It's it's it's evil. &gt;&gt; And we need to recognize it as evil. &gt;&gt; There's no kind of half good people. Without God, we are disgraceful sinners. And we need to see the darkness of we need to see the bondage of it in order to rejoice in the liberty that is in Christ. &gt;&gt; And so when I come down and I'm spending some time on it. Uh I don't want you to get quiet. You rejoice that you can see because there's a lot of people and and in fact is most of the population don't really think what they do is wrong. That's true. &gt;&gt; And they they they can do very very wrong things, very evil things. But somehow in this generation, it can be excused. It can there can be a a a way found out uh you know to make it look not as bad as it really is. And I have put it this way. God has the supernatural technology to capture and preserve our words, our thoughts and deeds in a book called the book of life. &gt;&gt; Hey, man with this puny insignificance makes computers that you can't even get rid of the things anymore. You can't get rid of they say, "Oh, it's up there in cyberspace somewhere." Well, I'll tell you something else. God's word of all of his prophets, of all of his holy men, of all of his and and the words of Jesus Christ and my words and the words of William Brandham and the words of every prophet is in cyberspace also. God didn't need a computer to put it up there. He has a dimension there and it is held there. It will be judging this more sinful world. The truth will be coming against falsehood and the lies and all of these uh injustices and things that have happened. God has his own technology. &gt;&gt; And he had that technology before. Man, we wouldn't even be able to discover this technology if God hadn't made a a a place for it, &gt;&gt; made a made it possible. There's not a person that could survive having the book of life of their life exposed. Not a single person. There's none righteous, know not one. There's none good, no not one. And on the one hand, we're thankful for that veil of flesh. And if you have risen above being thankful for the veil of flesh, I'll tell you by the time we're done, I hope that you will see that in our flesh, that is in our flesh dwelleth no good thing. And that is why brother Vander would even say the greatest problem and the greatest enemy that we have is our own self. Amen. &gt;&gt; On the one hand, we find this weakness of the flesh &gt;&gt; and the flesh is weak. You can't make it strong. Jesus said it is weak. &gt;&gt; The flesh is weak. &gt;&gt; But there is a, you know, I don't want to just leave you there, but the flesh in itself is weak. Now there is one a veil is something that conceals. So we say the veil of flesh. Well, it conceals a whole lot. But there is one who sees through that veil and it is God. The scripture says, "Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight, but all things, all things, say with me, all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do." &gt;&gt; And in that I want to rejoice also. That's his plan. That's his program. He allowed us to have. So we live in this world and we've got this veil of flesh uh and and it can't be penetrated. I mean there are things if you wish to expose to your friend fine but there are things that you people will never know know about you. Nobody will know about you. No believer will know. No unbeliever will know. No business associate. No friend. Nobody will know. That's your own. You've got that veil in your own flesh. And God allowed that. But at the same time, he's tried to tell this world that he can see through that veil. And he knows all things. There's no attitude. There's no feeling. There's no anything that can be hidden from God. And we want to say, "Praise God for that. &gt;&gt; I'm finally found out. &gt;&gt; I'm totally exposed." And the sooner a person finds that out, the better off you are. &gt;&gt; There is somebody who sees the allseeing eye of almighty God. &gt;&gt; And we're thankful we have &gt;&gt; an allseeing eye. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who can see us as we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so the scripture says Paul in Corinthians, for he hath made him, that was Jesus Christ, he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, these things, friends, are &gt;&gt; I'm going to take my time and penetrate on them &gt;&gt; because these are things that we know, we hear, but I want to bring it down into a practical term so that if we really believe it, then there will be a an incredible rejoicing in our heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he he who knew no sin. Now here was here was a God in flesh. A life that also had a veil of flesh. And when God looked through that veil, there was no sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he lived a sinless life. &gt;&gt; The only human frame that walked on earth sinless. &gt;&gt; And God looked upon him and said, "This is my son. This who this is who came out of the bosom, my bosom. &gt;&gt; This is my This is my prodigy. This is actually my seed &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God dwelt in him. The fullness of God dwelt in him and there was no sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He had a veil of flesh &gt;&gt; but there was no sin. But when he finally that body finally took its final steps and came to a place called Calvary &gt;&gt; and was nailed to a cross and was made sin &gt;&gt; for us. &gt;&gt; Then God could not look on him any longer &gt;&gt; and God turned his face from him and he cried, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" That was you there, friends. &gt;&gt; That was me hanging there. &gt;&gt; That was my sin. That was everything that was in that book &gt;&gt; that were we would be horribly ashamed of this morning. That content of that book hung on that cross. &gt;&gt; And God could not look on him. Although he looked on him one time said, "This is my son. in whom I'm well pleased. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, in whom I'm pleased to dwell. And now the same son hangs on the cross. And the veil of his flesh is tore open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God can see him as he is. And he has taken not only our sin, but the Bible says the sin of the whole world. He became sin. &gt;&gt; Those words are so powerful. I doubt if we can really grasp it. But he became sin. &gt;&gt; Who knew no sin &gt;&gt; that we who were sinners could be righteous, &gt;&gt; take his righteousness. &gt;&gt; So that God then in the second stage could look on us &gt;&gt; and say, "I see no sin. It was a complete transfer. &gt;&gt; It was a complete transfer. &gt;&gt; I'm declaring here today, all of your sin was nailed to the tree. &gt;&gt; All of your sin, every thought, everything that was recorded in God's book was erased by his blood. There's no man that can stand before that cross and and declare any righteousness. &gt;&gt; And now the veil of the temple was tore from top to bottom. &gt;&gt; And the mercy seat was exposed. &gt;&gt; Was just completely tore from top to bottom. Why? because the the veil of his flesh was being tore. &gt;&gt; He was tore wide open. &gt;&gt; He was totally exposed. He was bruised and wounded more than that of any man. His visage was marred more than that of any man. And the the veil of his flesh was tore. And while that was happening, the veil of the temple was tore also because when it was tore, the mercy seat was completely exposed within him. God was in Christ. &gt;&gt; Reconciling the world to himself. Reconciliation was exposed. When his flesh was exposed, &gt;&gt; God looked upon when it was tore. The flesh, the body of Jesus Christ was tore, God saw his own attributes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The sins of the whole world. As long as a person is living here on earth. As long as a person is living here on earth. Listen to anyone who's here that may not be fully surrendered. I'm talking about fully surrendered. &gt;&gt; Except a man be born again. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about being born again. &gt;&gt; He cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Now the prophet explains it and I'm so glad for the mysteries. There's a mystery of redemption as brother Tom mentioned it here in the last service. I thought he was going to get off on my this Sunday morning service. He said now we have contact. I want you to listen very very close now and don't think that I'm exaggerating something. I'm only projecting it from what the prophet of God has said. So we understand something of the age that we're in. &gt;&gt; He said now we have contact through science through science the fourth dimension as it was because coming right through this building now comes pictures. So there's pictures going through this building voices of radio pictures. I'm glad that there's a veil &gt;&gt; between I and those pictures. &gt;&gt; I'm glad there's a veil between I and those voices. &gt;&gt; How terrible it would be for us to come and try and have a sacred service and have those voices that you would hear on radio or television or those pictures of those strip teasers, those goddesses of Hollywood coming through this building. But God has something to erase it. &gt;&gt; God has a way to eliminate it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God is going to destroy it even with a fire in the heavens. &gt;&gt; Because there's demon forces in the heavens. &gt;&gt; And Satan is the prince of the power of the air. And God's going to destroy what's in the air. &gt;&gt; There's voices going through this building. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is pictures going through this building and our senses does not contact it. You're sitting here in your five senses and it does not contacted but yet they have a tube or a crystal that picks up those ether waves and manifests them. So you see right in this building now is live actions. Not talking about some, you know, pictures from a book. &gt;&gt; Right in this building now is live actions of people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the air, &gt;&gt; live voices. &gt;&gt; They're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know it. They're absolutely the truth &gt;&gt; and the only thing you can do to catch it. I said I don't understand the mechanics of those things that science has invented but we know that it proves to us there is a fourth dimension. &gt;&gt; Now in the fifth dimension is where the sinner the the unbeliever dies and goes. The fifth dimension is a kind of well a horrible dimension. It's like a nightmare. He said he's locked in it because he cannot go into the presence of God because he has no blood. &gt;&gt; That's the difference between the unbeliever and there may be some sitting here. If you have not had the new birth, you do not have the blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; You do not have that which came when the veil was tore. &gt;&gt; When the veil was tore, the blood went to the earth and the spirit went to God and the body went to the tomb. &gt;&gt; But he has no blood to go into the presence of God. And God cannot look on him without that veil of blood. Right? &gt;&gt; And he cannot go back to earth because his time has been lived up. &gt;&gt; He cannot return. There's no more time for him to live on earth. And he's caught, as the prophet says, in a nightmare. &gt;&gt; As you and I sit here today, there's untold millions of people in that place. Their lying prophet spoke over their casket that they were going to heaven. They're going to a wonderful place. Don't you believe it? &gt;&gt; Without God, they went to hell. &gt;&gt; Without God, without the new birth, &gt;&gt; they will be caught and are caught. And even those who've come and proclaimed the message and have played with it and have just identified with it but have not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the new birth. They are destined for that place. You might say, "Well, I'm predestinated." I will say, "Well, prove it." Then &gt;&gt; prove you're predestinated by yielding to the voice of God and that seed. If I was not right with God, I would be at this altar &gt;&gt; before I'm done preaching. I'd be down at this altar. I'd be on my knees. I'd be calling on God. Have mercy on me. I've heard so much and I've not surrendered to you. You sent such a voice. You sent such a vindication and I have just mouthed it. I have just played with it. I have not made a full I've not made a full decision. And you have that power of decision. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God, if you're truthful in your heart, he will honor that. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, the fifth dimension is where the sinner or unbeliever goes." He said, "And when a Christian dies, he goes to the sixth dimension." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God is in the seventh dimension. &gt;&gt; We're going to be right next to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When a believer dies, they go right next to God. And then he said, you see, a Christian when he dies, he goes under the altar of God, right into the presence of God, &gt;&gt; and he's at rest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're destined for rest. &gt;&gt; There's not much rest in this age, but we're destined for rest. That's according to the promise of God. And he says to break it down. When a man has a nightmare, he's not altogether asleep. And neither is he awake. He's between sleep and awake. And that's what makes him have a horrible shaking and screaming because he's not asleep and he's not awake. He's drawing an analogy here. &gt;&gt; And you can have that in normal life. You have a nightmare and you can't wake up and you're not awake and you're not asleep but you're in a nightmare and it's a horrible place and a prophet of God is saying that's where you go. It is the same kind of a situation. He says and to take that shows that where a man goes when he dies unconverted he's lived his time up. He's he he's dead on the earth and he cannot go into the presence of God because he's not fit to go there without the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching a Sunday morning service. I'm just asking you, are you fit to die? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you fit to leave here? Two of these pastors that were on the way to the convention in Congo didn't make it. One was lost in a boat in water and one was killed in a truck accident. Well, you say, "Well, my that is." No, I'm bringing it home to you. You might not get home. &gt;&gt; You don't have any guarantee you're going to get home. You don't have any guarantee that you're going to see the morning and have breakfast in the morning. You have no guarantee. Are you fit? Are you ready &gt;&gt; to die? &gt;&gt; Say amen if you are ready. &gt;&gt; Give a testimony to Christ. &gt;&gt; And if you have a question, you don't want to leave these doors with that question still hanging in your mind. &gt;&gt; You might say, "I've never heard you preach like this, brother Bisco. This might be my last service. I don't know. You want to?" I don't know either. I don't have any guarantee of this afternoon or tonight. I don't have any guarantee I'll get home. &gt;&gt; Neither do you. &gt;&gt; Fact, you come to Cloverdale Bible means nothing. &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing. This is just a building of boards and and concrete and whatever more. &gt;&gt; We want to know that we have the life of Christ in us. The life that God looked at when the veil of flesh was tore open and could find no sin. &gt;&gt; The only sin he could see was your sin, my sin. But the blood was there to atone for it. &gt;&gt; And the prophet calls it the veil of blood. &gt;&gt; And that's where I get the veil of redemption. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I and you and every believer is concealed behind the veil of redemption. &gt;&gt; And when God looks through the blood, look through that veil, he can see no sin. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That ought to make any believer want to stand and shout. &gt;&gt; We can say, "My sins are gone." &gt;&gt; You can't see them. God can't see them. The devil can't find them. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, our thoughts, our thoughts, whatever you think of what I just said is going through the building right now. Maybe somebody says, "Well, you know what? I can't really grasp that. I don't believe that." That's going through the building. You might think it's staying in your mind. It's not in your mind. It's already It's already escaped. &gt;&gt; It's escaped the veil of your flesh, &gt;&gt; your thoughts. That's why a man in a human body called a prophet of God, William Brham. stood on the platform and said, "Don't think that." &gt;&gt; Where was the thought? &gt;&gt; The man, the woman, the person thought it's just in my mind. That's my own private thoughts. No, they're not private. &gt;&gt; And that's why he'd cry out, "Don't think that." &gt;&gt; And he'd tell them what they're thinking and he'd said, "That's not mind readading. Jesus perceived their thoughts. Why? They thought they had their little private thoughts to themselves, thinking he's a deceiver and he's that, he's this. And Jesus was able to counter them because those thoughts were already released from the veil of the flesh. &gt;&gt; So he cries out once, "Don't think that. It's not fanaticism." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. cuz he picked up the thought. It was already out. It was already in the building. &gt;&gt; And God had a vessel that could capture it &gt;&gt; and bring it out of out of the dimension. He You talk about cyberspace. We're way beyond that. &gt;&gt; And he picks up the thought that's not fanaticism. Don't think that. He says God will have us to answer at the day of judgment where the secrets of all hearts are disclosed. &gt;&gt; He says come now come sir. A man comes. It isn't. No it isn't discernment. The man is thinking is discernment. He caught the thought. It's not discernment. Don't think that he's not here. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's discernment. He's not here." Don't think that. He said, &gt;&gt; "It's not discernment. Don't think that he's not here. He is. He's here and he can do anything he wishes. It's a lady's trouble. &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to tell you and show you that this God of this message, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; has com has everything exposed before him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're thankful for that &gt;&gt; because this message also tells me of what is erased and what is forgotten and what is covered and what is concealed under the veil of blood. [Music] &gt;&gt; And if you question the veil of blood, then go on in your darkness and live with your sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the veil of darkness, the veil of the veil of the blood that is I I wouldn't be standing here at this pulpit if it wasn't for that &gt;&gt; veil of his blood. &gt;&gt; He said to the lady, "It's a lady's trouble. It's also a heart trouble. It's left you now, sister. He who lets me know." &gt;&gt; Amen. that it was there lets me know that it's gone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He that lets us know we were sinners also has let us know it's gone. &gt;&gt; It's gone. &gt;&gt; Don't ever let the devil drag it up to you again. It's gone. He who lets us, the very God that speaks to the word and brings a conviction to your heart is the same God who says it is gone. &gt;&gt; What kind what kind of a crime what kind of a spiritual crime would it be to take God's word and twist it back and say, "Well, my mind says, well, it's not really gone." Amen. &gt;&gt; You got your debate with God. &gt;&gt; Not with man, &gt;&gt; not with me, not with anybody else. My prophet says it is gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ says it is gone. &gt;&gt; Yes, there is a process. And if you've not repented, I urge you. &gt;&gt; I call upon you to make a full repentance. It's not something that a person walks into. It's something that a person willfully of their own accord they do. They must repent. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about godly sorrow. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about full repentance. &gt;&gt; And then accept. Don't stay. I found people they repent and they repent and they repent. No. Listen. Repent and then go on and serve God. Repent and rejoice that that the that the blood of Jesus Christ has cleansed you. [Music] &gt;&gt; God help me. &gt;&gt; He who lets me know it was there lets me know it's gone. &gt;&gt; So go rejoicing &gt;&gt; and be happy. &gt;&gt; He says, I'm not reading your mind. No, &gt;&gt; don't think that. &gt;&gt; Even the woman who was there for healing was thinking that he's reading my mind. &gt;&gt; And he's telling her now, what where did that thought go? You think, well, it's just in the chemistry of the brain and I have certain thoughts, not a chance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the God that's speaking this word through me even knows that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you might be surprised what a minister under the anointing of the Holy Spirit preaching what he catches. &gt;&gt; And he hasn't got time to even play games with it. &gt;&gt; He's there to preach the gospel and to keep preaching in anticipation that God by the Holy Ghost will change your thoughts. &gt;&gt; It's the same word that's here today. The same word that's being preached. It's the same Holy Ghost that was in Jesus Christ. The same Holy Ghost that was in his prophet and all the prophets. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There is no message that exposes it like this message. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad that we are before one with whom we have to do and all things are naked and bare before him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said to this woman even actually receiving her healing, don't think that I'm not reading your mind. And it's not mental telepathy. It's the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I I I want you people to come to a reality this morning. I want to speak to you directly. Here's people just like you, a woman just like any woman in this place. And she's seeking and desiring and needing something physical. And here Satan is putting a thought in her mind. She's thinking, not realizing that, not realizing that that thought has already escaped the veil of flesh. And there God has a prophet that can capture that and tells her it's not mental telepathy. &gt;&gt; Satan was trying to rob her of her healing. This is not mental telepathy and I'm not reading your mind. &gt;&gt; And then to explain where she was in her thought. This is mental telepathy. And on and now she has a prophet telling her what it was. It is the resurrection of Jesus Christ. How deceived &gt;&gt; the deceiver would have an individual to be &gt;&gt; thinking it's mental telepathy when it's actually the power of the resurrection &gt;&gt; that is right there &gt;&gt; to bring them to a physical healing and a spiritual healing &gt;&gt; I say oh love of God &gt;&gt; how rich how pure &gt;&gt; how wonderful oh love of God &gt;&gt; that you look down upon us weak, &gt;&gt; humans, worms of the earth, &gt;&gt; and have patience with us after you so clearly expose yourself and tell us of your great love and then we go on thinking it's some mental thing or or some discernment or some mental telepathy or something and then he appeals to us. Don't think that. And I'm speaking this to this congregation and all who may be on the internet. Don't think those thoughts. &gt;&gt; Think on these things. &gt;&gt; Think on things that are pure. And listen, if you're not born again, you don't have the capacity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And even as a born again believer, we have thoughts that go through our mind and words that come out of our mouth. We say, "Oh, God, I don't want that to be." But you want to thank God. You have a greater one in you &gt;&gt; than him that's in the world. You have a greater one in you than him that's inspiring that thought. And that is why you have also that spirit when it comes. You would not. &gt;&gt; You don't want that. &gt;&gt; And that's what God is looking at. [Music] in the hidden life in Christ. He said you're scared. People today is afraid. What are you afraid of? Why even death itself don't scare a Christian? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Death, where is thy strength? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The very thoughts of people is scared. Oh, brother Brandham, the doctor told me I just can't get well. What are you scared of? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, this is very scientific. Comes from the God of science. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says there's an atonement. What are you scared of? There's an atonement laying for you &gt;&gt; yonder. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Brandham, I've done so much sins. What are you scared of? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's an atonement. &gt;&gt; And I couldn't I couldn't emphasize sufficiently in all of the scriptures. I could go through the scriptures and take all the negative things of us as humans and you would be down on the floor, I would think, crawling out of this place because of the darkness and the evil and how God looks on it. Think of the holiness of God &gt;&gt; and your actions in the last week, your thoughts in the last week, your words in the last few hours &gt;&gt; in the presence of a holy God. You couldn't even exist in his presence. And so when we see that then we have such a thanksgiving that there is an exit. &gt;&gt; There is a way out. &gt;&gt; So he's asking what are you scared of? There's an atonement laying yonder. Well, brother Brandham, now he's going in into conversation as it were with you and I. Well, brother Brandham, I've done so much sins. What are you scared of? There's an atonement waiting for you. There's someone who loves you. Don't be scared. &gt;&gt; And now, don't ever forget these words. The constant &gt;&gt; words of Jesus. Fear not. &gt;&gt; I'm he that was dead and is alive again and alive forever more. &gt;&gt; Fear not. &gt;&gt; He said, get in that atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Why? Because those words &gt;&gt; are going through this building. &gt;&gt; Fear not. &gt;&gt; I'm he that was alive. &gt;&gt; All of the words and all the filth and all the vulgarity and all the vile things that are going through these airwaves that are here with us at this present time. But amongst those &gt;&gt; are words that shall never pass away. That's why Jesus has said, brethren, heaven and earth may pass away and heaven and earth will pass away. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says in the future home that the heavens will be on fire. reading it from uh Timoth Peter's gospel and he says it's not just a fire but it's a holy fire &gt;&gt; because it burns up everything that's held in the atmosphere &gt;&gt; but there is another atmosphere &gt;&gt; I've got to convey it to you there's another atmosphere and in that atmosphere is another voice as Jesus said heaven and earth will pass away but My words will not pass away. &gt;&gt; When I quote what the prophet of God has said under the inspiration of God, those words will survive the fire of God. &gt;&gt; The words of Jesus will survive the fire of God. &gt;&gt; Going through this building at this moment, I will be thou whole. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Neither do I condemn thee. &gt;&gt; Go and sin no more. &gt;&gt; Going through this building right now. And those words will be going through the atmosphere when the heavens have been burned and on fire with a holy fire. &gt;&gt; This business of cyberspace, God's going to hit the delete button &gt;&gt; and he's going to delete all of that rubbish. &gt;&gt; He's going to clean up this nation of garbage. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's going to burn it with a holy fire. &gt;&gt; And everything that you've said of a doubting nature, of an evil nature, it's already been taken care of by the other book called the book of life, the Lamb's book of life. People [Music] [Applause] have read that scripture, have read the scripture for generations &gt;&gt; where the lamb stood and took the book, but it actually happened &gt;&gt; in this time. &gt;&gt; The lamb &gt;&gt; and he waited until he had Elijah here on earth &gt;&gt; and to reveal to us and to all who would believe. And if you don't wish to believe it, keep your sin &gt;&gt; and walk out of this building condemned. &gt;&gt; Not because I said so, because he said so. &gt;&gt; If you do not believe, you will remain condemned. &gt;&gt; But in the in the sacred mercies of God, God sends Elijah here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. to tell us what is in the contents of the book. &gt;&gt; And I'm not so much on the contents now. I'm in on I'm actually dealing with the action. &gt;&gt; The action. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is when he stood because the prophet in the in the bridge, &gt;&gt; oh friends, help me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Give me strength &gt;&gt; as is so urgent upon me. But when the prophet who's already spoken the church ages, the seven of them, and laid it all out &gt;&gt; in perfect historical order, &gt;&gt; and he lays out the church ages, then he meets the seven angels of God. Don't let a thought come into your mind, I don't believe that. Because that thought will already be released and God will pick it up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it'll be released from your &gt;&gt; veil of flesh. You want to say although I may not understand, I believe. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I don't only believe it. I rejoice in it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm rejoicing in his deliverance. I'm rejoicing in his salvation. I will not believe an evil thought. I will not hold an evil thought. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm here for a revival, a personal revival today. I've been laboring under the word of God, and I desire a tremendous release. I pray, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; give me the energy &gt;&gt; and give me the word &gt;&gt; and may a spirit of revelation &gt;&gt; grip the people [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; and and and in the breach." Listen close. in the breach in the message the breach because he's now called out &gt;&gt; an elect lady out of the church ages and now he's going to reveal the husband &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; who the seals was him &gt;&gt; and she was called out of the church ages &gt;&gt; and he's going to have a marriage &gt;&gt; but he has to reveal who he is &gt;&gt; for her to see who he is. &gt;&gt; And so he goes to the Old Testament to the book of Ruth &gt;&gt; and he shows how that the kinsman, &gt;&gt; one who was close, &gt;&gt; one who's close, &gt;&gt; stay with me. I'm not just preaching, also teaching, &gt;&gt; one that was close, a near kinsman. &gt;&gt; But the prophet said, according to the book of Ruth, there was a nearer kinsman. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said that nearer kinsman was the devil &gt;&gt; because you were born in sin &gt;&gt; and shapened in iniquity &gt;&gt; and he had a claim on you. And if you have not received Jesus Christ, he still has a claim on you. &gt;&gt; And he will put his thoughts in your mind and you will think them and have no capacity to excommunicate them. But the believer &gt;&gt; has another power, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; and he can rid himself or their yourself &gt;&gt; of those unbelieving thoughts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because of the other word that's also going through this room at this time. Think on these things. Whatsoever whatsoever is lovely, whatsoever is true, whatsoever is honest. Hallelujah. Think on these things. Those words are going through this building. [Music] &gt;&gt; There's another word. &gt;&gt; Do you hear the voice of Apostle Paul? If you had the capacity, you could pick it up because that voice is going through here. We have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Nathan, we have the mind of Christ. We have the mind of Christ. And that voice will be going through the atmosphere long after other voices have all been stilled. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; And there was another nearer kinsman. And Boaz, the one who was close, who was Christ, came and said, "Will you will you redeem Naomi's estate?" Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will redeem it." Do you know why? Because she was the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; She was the Old Jewish church. And all they had there was the blood of bulls and goats and lambs and sheep and that could continue on forever. &gt;&gt; Yes, I'll redeem her because we'll just do this year after year after year. Well, let it be known to you, &gt;&gt; this kinsman. Let it be known to you. If you redeem her, you must also redeem a gentile bride, a Moabitete, a no good woman &gt;&gt; coming out of a terrible group of people. The Moabites, you've got to redeem her says, "I can't do it." &gt;&gt; Boaz had the wealth. &gt;&gt; Our Boaz, Jesus Christ, he could pull out the blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blood that Satan hasn't got. &gt;&gt; The blood that will be the veil of redemption. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That can erase every sin, every transgression. &gt;&gt; And he says, "I can't do it." &gt;&gt; And he was correct. He couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; Satan was silenced &gt;&gt; at Calvary. &gt;&gt; He comes about you and every believer &gt;&gt; as a roaring line. And maybe he's roaring even at this moment. &gt;&gt; And soon as you go out these doors, out of this atmosphere, for sure he'll be roaring around &gt;&gt; trying to get you to doubt what has been said. Let me declare to you in the name of the Lord to believe this word is your only possibility of being delivered. And if you forget it, if you disallow it, if you disbelieve it, he may never call you again. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, you're trying to scare us now." Just try it out. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I were sitting in your seat, if you're an unbeliever or just a make believer or someone just sympathizing with the message or just raised about and have it in your home, I would I I'd shake in my boots &gt;&gt; after this vindication &gt;&gt; after this kind of word, &gt;&gt; after this kind of myster exposing of the mysteries of quat &gt;&gt; and you still doubt, &gt;&gt; right? [Applause] You'll be in a very dark place. &gt;&gt; There was a nearer kinsman. &gt;&gt; And when a pro and when brother Brandham is speaking about it, listen close now. &gt;&gt; If you may not understand everything, but it'll you'll mean a lot more to you as a little time goes on. And now between it's called the breach. What is the breach? It's something in between. &gt;&gt; It's between the church ages. And he said to those in the church ages, "Come out of her, my people." &gt;&gt; And be ye separate, sayth who? The Lord. &gt;&gt; Not William Brham. Come out of her. And there was a group that had come out. &gt;&gt; And now the God himself said, "Go into the desert." Many prophets went into the desert. Go into the desert. And he met him there with seven angels. He said they came from eternity in a split. &gt;&gt; You talk about science. You talk about astronauts. They know nothing about this. &gt;&gt; This is a god of science. Those angels came out of eternity in a split &gt;&gt; and hung in the sky so that man with his technology could take the picture and call it mysterious cloud. Of course, it was mysterious. It held all the mysteries. Of course, it was mysterious. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said it wasn't for them. &gt;&gt; It's for you. &gt;&gt; It's for you. &gt;&gt; It's for you, my precious friend. [Music] &gt;&gt; To tell you about full redemption. &gt;&gt; And the full redemption was I have descended. &gt;&gt; I've come down now. &gt;&gt; I have a validated voice here on earth. I have a prophet mouthpiece and I have come down to tell you I am I am redeeming you. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, I thought I was redeemed." No, now you're being you have been redeemed, but you're being claimed. &gt;&gt; And in the scripture, the Bible says, "And the lamb stood &gt;&gt; changed his posture." changed and you lived &gt;&gt; in the in the hour he changed his posture and the Bible says he came and he took the bookl &gt;&gt; your book &gt;&gt; your thoughts &gt;&gt; your acts &gt;&gt; your deeds &gt;&gt; your neighbor sitting beside you doesn't know but he knew &gt;&gt; and he came and took your Look. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet said he was John saw him coming out of the eternities. He was bleeding. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He'd been in battle, &gt;&gt; not for himself. In battle for you &gt;&gt; so that he would be worthy to take the book. &gt;&gt; And when it fell into his hands, brother Daniel, it became the lamb's book of life. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah to the lamb. Glory to the lamb of God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And what was in your book couldn't pass to his book &gt;&gt; because the veil of the blood &gt;&gt; prevented it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Dead. Old Testament, the blood of bulls, lambs, and the commandment of the law and prophets and patriarchs and holy men of God. But there was no blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To take away their sin. &gt;&gt; This was the record of their life. Amen. &gt;&gt; But it starts here with the lamb's book. &gt;&gt; The generation. The first verse is the generation &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The son of David and the son of Abraham. Oh, over here. The prophet said Abraham lied, &gt;&gt; but it couldn't go through the veil of blood and it was never reported over here. Jacob was a shyer. &gt;&gt; Jacob was a shyer, but it couldn't go through the veil and end up over here. &gt;&gt; David committed adultery, but it couldn't go through the blood and get over here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the veil of redemption &gt;&gt; and none of the sins, &gt;&gt; none of the weaknesses of the Old Testament could pass through into the New. That's a very thin veil, but it's a powerful one. It could not come through. It could not come through. [Music] And if you want to keep what's on this side, if you want to keep what's in your record, &gt;&gt; you may do so by the simple act of disbelief. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to believe it. I'm not going to believe it. I'm not going to accept it. &gt;&gt; Then you keep your sin. &gt;&gt; You keep the awfulness of it. and you pay the consequence. &gt;&gt; I've delivered my soul. &gt;&gt; And through this building, through this building are words that are going through. And those words, Satan would condemn you. &gt;&gt; Satan would point out every weakness. He is a roaring line. and he goes around and he's going to try to get you to make a wrong confession. Deny him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen to the tape if you wish from Dawson Creek and a young man who I met and took a picture of a soldier boy. What's the matter? Soldier boy. While the people are singing, I love him. I love him. Comes another voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. because it's picking up the thoughts &gt;&gt; that were released from the mind of the body of flesh &gt;&gt; of a soldier boy condemned. &gt;&gt; What's the matter, soldier boy? That's the devil talking to you. &gt;&gt; Here's the whole solution. Deny him. &gt;&gt; Deny him and you'll go home and be a real gentleman and be a real man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, can you grasp the power of the grace of God &gt;&gt; from a homosexual who's trying to commit suicide? &gt;&gt; The prophet is telling him, "Deny him. Deny him and you'll go home and be a real gentleman and be a real man." &gt;&gt; Duty end of subject. That's all there is to it. You can't add anything to that. &gt;&gt; And it's on that basis you sit here today &gt;&gt; redeemed. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; This is not based on how good anybody lived. the power and the strength of the blood &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; the veil &gt;&gt; of redemption. &gt;&gt; The constant words. Don't ever forget this. Don't ever forget the service. The constant words. Whatever you think or whatever you say when you leave here, make sure that you're agreeing with Christ and the scriptures and the message. Make sure you're agreeing with it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I was I don't want to forget the lamb stood and whether he stepped forward or whatever and he took the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet is mentions that and he goes back in the Old Testament says Boaz comes &gt;&gt; Boaz comes to the field and there's a Moabitete gentile. He said who is this woman and he has a servant singular who identifies who she is and introduces her to him which is exactly what was happening on earth at that moment. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that he first addressed the nearer kinsman. &gt;&gt; Jesus dealt with Satan. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He took authority over him. You haven't got the wherewithal I do. &gt;&gt; You don't have the price I do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're not a mighty man of wealth. You gave it up when you disbelieved in heaven. &gt;&gt; And I've overcome you. And you've been cast to the earth. and I overcome you again. &gt;&gt; I point you to your defeat. [Music] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says in Boaz, &gt;&gt; doesn't come to the field now because she's attracted and she comes and lays down at his feet. That's right. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And Boaz," now here we have an Old Testament, "and he took he took Ruth." &gt;&gt; Hang on close. Now, he took Ruth, which was the same act that Jesus stood and took the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She had a book, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know that her forefathers came about and her nation came about through incest? &gt;&gt; She has a terrible history. Her book of life is wretched. &gt;&gt; But now Boaz took her &gt;&gt; and inserted his seed into her and she became a mother of Jesus Christ. God sent his prophet not to expand your thoughts and to give you more thinking power and to give you some more stories of the Bible. He didn't come to create new message churches. He came to tell the people you're my wife &gt;&gt; and I have taken you &gt;&gt; to myself. &gt;&gt; Not only that, I have sent my seed and pregnantated you with my seed. and made you my wife. &gt;&gt; You're not merely my bride. You're my wife. &gt;&gt; And as Mary was pregnant as a remaining a virgin, so was this bride pregnant remaining a virgin. &gt;&gt; And your book of life tells you, I've been in this church. I've been in that church. I believed this. I was an atheist. I was an agnostic. I was in sin. I wasn't anything. I blasphemed. That's what Paul said he did. I I did this. I did that. I ran in the streets. I I I lived the lowest of life or I lived the best and a moral life. You still need redemption. &gt;&gt; And this one when he came and told you, he didn't care what you did. &gt;&gt; He didn't care what Ruth did. He didn't care what what any of them did. He didn't care what Tamar did. He didn't care what what Rahab did. He didn't care what Basheba did. He he he came to redeem the whole works. &gt;&gt; How? Not by some emotional thing. By pregnantating you with his spoken word seed. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you understood what I'm saying. And so I'm closing. &gt;&gt; You don't believe me? Having therefore, brethren and sisters, boldness &gt;&gt; to enter in. you couldn't have been able to enter in before now &gt;&gt; but to enter into the holiest &gt;&gt; by the blood of Jesus &gt;&gt; by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us &gt;&gt; through the veil. It was concealed. But now we go through the veil. &gt;&gt; That is to say, his flesh. &gt;&gt; When his flesh was tore, the price was paid, &gt;&gt; the blood veil, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, came up between holiest and where we live. And now we go into the holiest of all. &gt;&gt; Amen. through the blood of Jesus Christ, which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast. &gt;&gt; And which enterth into that within the veil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well friends, I can't describe to you how thankful I am because on I'm very conscious of the two books, the two natures &gt;&gt; and the two births. And I thank God my mother and father brought me into the world. But I thank God for that birth so that I could stand here and come to know him in redemption. &gt;&gt; That I could labor for him and toil for him. And I just say to you, especially you young men, live your life for this bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Live your life for others. to this congregation. The only fulfilled life is one when you get my age, you can look back and say, "I I I did what I could." Like the people in Congo, I I I drove people to the meeting. I picked them up. I helped those that were less fortunate, those that were poor, those that come from Seattle, those that have driven a long distance. I'm not just going to go home and enjoy the quietness of my home, but I want to fellowship with them. I want to open up my heart and open up my home. It comes down right down where we live. &gt;&gt; And when you get down the road, if the Lord Jesus gives you time, you'll look back and you'll say, "I'm so happy that my life has become fulfilled by serving the bride of Jesus Christ." This is we're not back there and the ages passed. We're here &gt;&gt; and we don't know what tomorrow holds. We don't know. But let's let's friends, let's give ourselves to this message. God bless you young people that have gone out on the streets and done whatever more. You'll never regret it. Reformatted the message. I can guarantee you somebody today is is is reading some of those messages because you put formatted it and you got it up there. Somebody's read reading Token. They're reading Kinsman Redeemer. They're reading this for the first time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say, "Praise be to God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have this glorious opportunity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To serve him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't get quiet on me now. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. God bless you participants and those that have been reached. God reached through to you. I trust that you'll take these these words and anchor them in your heart. I wonder if we could sing, Brother Ryan, if you can come and help me. I'd like to just sing. We have an anchor that keeps the soul steadfast and sure. Isn't this a wonderful message that God's given us? &gt;&gt; You talk about science. We're so far beyond science. &gt;&gt; I I read the things that the people do and and and the things that that they have come up with. And my my no wonder people read the prophet's message and just get lost in it because it goes so far beyond the reach of our mental capacity. Let's stand together and I want to just have a prayer. Father, how delighted I am that you have given people whose hearts are open to your word and whose minds are thinking on the good things of God. I pray, Father, that you will take every doubting spirit and cast it into the pit of despair. cast it away from the people. Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ, I ask, oh God, that you will take control of every spirit and bring it into captivity to the mind of Christ. Father, that you will achieve and accomplish in this meeting what you would have done. Oh God, oh God, lives are in the balances and people are weighing things out. Father, don't let them choose the wrong direction. &gt;&gt; Let them cast themselves completely &gt;&gt; at your feet calling on you for mercy. Lord, &gt;&gt; may we have a true the signs following that you would have that would be a pleasure to you in Jesus Christ's name. I commit this audience to you. Amen. Amen. We have an anchor that keeps the soul. If you'll say sing it out, please. [Music] The soul steadfast and sure while the pills roll. It's fastened to the rock that cannot move. Grounded firmity in the Savior's love. We have an anchor. The king of While the ro it's fastened to the rock that cannot move in the Savior. &gt;&gt; Let's sing the first verse. Will your anchor hold in the storms of life? When the clouds unfold, their wings strike. When the strong ties lift and the cables strain, when your anchor drift over singing, we have an anchor that keeps us home. and passing through passing through eternity in the Savior. When our eyes behold through the gathering night the city of gold our har we shall anchor fast by the heavenly shore. When the storms fall past forever more and turn the soul stand and sure while the old road I'm fastened to the rock that cannot move in the saints. Friends, I am so so so grateful, so thankful to God for the revelation of this word. [Music] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you're not sitting in some dead &gt;&gt; tradition, &gt;&gt; living off of history? &gt;&gt; This is now. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Weakness I found to cover all my sins. [Music] Oh, it's in Jesus. Oh, in Jesus. It's in Jesus. He's the one. He's the rock of salvation and he's a firm foundation. It's in Jesus. He is the one. It's in Jesus. Oh, it's in Jesus. Oh, in Jesus. It's in Jesus and he the one he's the rock of salvation. [Music] It's in Jesus. He is the one. Praise the Lord. Well, I have only one desire that brother Bisco would have just carried on a little more. Then we just could have gone right into the communion service because I don't even know where to pick up any pieces. Yeah, it's tremendous. &gt;&gt; We might just have to go right to the communion table, saints of God, or just replay the tape. It was just marvelous. &gt;&gt; 4:00. At four o'clock, the service this evening will be started and we've got a few hours to take a little rest. But brother Bram said this is something we just don't do as a tradition. This is something we take very serious and we're thankful that we can come to the Lord's supper table this evening and that we could tar one for another. I believe believe it'll be a special and wonderful time for each and every one of us. So be praying this afternoon that God will just have his divine will and way within this service this evening. Let's pray. Father, we can truly say we've heard wonderful words of life. And Lord, it's thrilled my soul and I am so thankful that we have this lovely unveiled Christ standing before a people. Lord, we're just praying now as we'll continue this afternoon and we'll have communion. We just pray the same presence that is here now will just continue with your people that we would unite our little licks of fire that you would be glorified for the scripture has declared, Lord, that if you would be lifted up, you'll draw all men to you. So, Father, we're just praying you'll be with the people this afternoon. Prepare us, we pray, and may you be glorified. go with us now we ask in Jesus precious name. Amen. You're dismissed. God be with you. God watch over you and give you a blessed afternoon. We'll see you Lord willing then at 4:00. God bless. Amen. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music]
