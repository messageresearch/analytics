[11:37] God
[11:41] word in My heart

[11:52] Spirit of God knees
[12:01] so that you
[12:04] can come
[12:10] and fill me.
[12:14] Hallelujah.
[12:16] Have your way, Lord Jesus. Is that your
[12:18] desire this morning at the cry of your
[12:20] heart? Lord, come and fill me and have
[12:22] your way, Lord. Amen. We're going to
[12:24] open the service in a word of prayer.
[12:27] Amen. Brother Eli Waldner, could I ask
[12:28] you to come, please open the service for
[12:30] us as the brothers would come and
[12:32] receive the morning offering also. We
[12:35] don't have any written prayer requests,
[12:37] but we know there are many needs in the
[12:40] body. Steve and our family, we've been
[12:42] remembering my grandfather. God's
[12:43] blessed him with long life, 99 years
[12:45] old, and he's just in a home now, and
[12:48] they're not expecting him to last much
[12:49] longer. And brother Brenham says God
[12:52] heals the old. That he can still reach
[12:54] down and touch a man at 99 years old. Or
[12:57] if it's time to go home, then we just
[12:59] pray that God would grant him peace and
[13:01] comfort and release from the pain. But
[13:04] we're just thankful for lives that God's
[13:07] moved upon. So I'm in the baptismal tank
[13:08] at 80ome years old and just been really
[13:11] privileged to see God move in our
[13:13] family. And brother Eli, could you come
[13:15] please and open the service for us as
[13:17] the deacons come? If there's something
[13:18] on your heart that you just like to
[13:20] remember with an upraised hand, we know
[13:21] that God sees that. It's an act of faith
[13:24] even to raise your hand and say, "God,
[13:25] see me." Amen. Thank you, brother Eli.
[13:37] Let's just pray.
[13:40] Dear gracious father, we come before you
[13:42] this morning giving you thanks and
[13:44] praise for your mercy and grace upon our
[13:46] lives, Father.
[13:48] So thankful for your love and kindness,
[13:50] Lord Jesus. You're such a merciful God,
[13:53] Lord. We appreciate what you've done in
[13:55] our lives, how you saved us and
[13:56] delivered us from sin and darkness of
[13:59] this world, Lord. Father, we just pray
[14:02] you'll continue to give us strength to
[14:04] fight to fight this fight to run the
[14:07] race that set before us, Lord. God, we
[14:10] need you every hour, Lord. We need your
[14:12] direction for our lives, Lord. We pray
[14:15] Lord this morning that they'd come and
[14:17] visit us in a special way. Lord, anoint
[14:19] your servant, oh God, that you've
[14:21] prepared, Lord, and he's laid his face
[14:24] before you. And God, we just pray you'll
[14:26] anoint him now and give him the words of
[14:30] life for each one of us, Father. We're
[14:32] just hungering and thirsting this
[14:33] morning, Lord. You know what we each
[14:36] have need of, Father. Just take us a
[14:38] little bit higher this morning, Lord.
[14:40] Deliver us from anything we need to be
[14:42] delivered off, Lord. Any anything that
[14:45] isn't pleasing to you, Father. Take it
[14:47] out of our lives, Father, and help us to
[14:50] keep pressing on, Lord. We just ask you
[14:53] to bless the service this morning in a
[14:55] mighty way, Father. We also pray,
[14:57] Father, for the the offerings this
[15:00] morning, Lord, and the tithes, oh God,
[15:02] as the people give, Father. We just ask,
[15:05] God, that your holy presence would be
[15:07] upon each one, Lord.
[15:10] Lord, you love giving hearts. We just
[15:12] ask you to bless each one that's giving.
[15:14] Father, Lord, that the word will
[15:16] continue to go forth in power, Lord.
[15:19] Just ask you to bless the offering this
[15:21] morning. Each one that's here this
[15:23] morning. Bless us. We pray in the name
[15:25] of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[15:32] Bless you as you have your seats. If I
[15:34] could but touch the hem of his garment.
[15:37] And we want to greet you all this
[15:38] morning in the precious name of our Lord
[15:39] Jesus Christ. It's happy to be gathered
[15:42] together again this morning. And brother
[15:44] Tony, sister, is this your last Sunday
[15:46] with us here? Bless you and the family.
[15:48] Brother Peter, sister Harley, Sister
[15:50] Katherine, we'll miss seeing you here
[15:51] with us, but God bless you on your
[15:53] travels and look forward to seeing you
[15:55] back here again. God bless you. Anyone
[15:58] else visiting, I saw Sister Connie
[16:00] Leonard here. Sister Connie, always a
[16:01] privilege to have you with us. God bless
[16:02] you. Anyone else who's visiting this
[16:04] morning, we pray you just feel welcome
[16:06] in the house of the Lord today. Let's
[16:08] sing this as we take up the offering. If
[16:10] I could but touch the hem of his
[16:12] garment.
[16:14] Oh, if I could not touch
[16:20] the head of his arms
[16:25] [Music]
[16:43] all
[16:45] [Music]
[16:48] my good touch. I know what he will again
[16:56] [Music]
[17:00] the
[17:04] [Music]
[17:11] one of his
[17:13] [Music]
[17:16] I know I
[17:19] [Music]
[17:21] My s for
[17:25] [Music]
[17:28] touch.
[17:29] [Music]
[17:31] &gt;&gt; One more time. In life touch
[17:34] [Music]
[17:48] [Music]
[17:54] I know I
[17:56] [Music]
[17:59] my sins all forgiven.
[18:02] [Music]
[18:04] I could touch it and I love
[18:10] [Music]
[18:12] Amen. We're going to turn the service
[18:13] directly to our pastor and ask our
[18:15] brother Ed to come. As he does, let's
[18:17] just sing Shackled by a heavy burden,
[18:19] neath the load of guilt and pain. Amen.
[18:22] But he touched me and now I'm no longer
[18:24] the same. Amen. Sing the verse. I was
[18:29] shackled
[18:30] by a hair
[18:32] [Music]
[18:41] and
[18:45] the hand the hand of Jesus
[18:50] I see you
[18:53] [Music]

[21:07] happened.
[21:09] [Music]
[21:22] Amen.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; Are you happy about that?
[21:27] &gt;&gt; We desire him to touch us again
[21:30] &gt;&gt; and again
[21:32] &gt;&gt; and again.
[21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:36] Something about his presence that just
[21:38] satisfies so wonderfully. Well, I heard
[21:42] uh our brother and sister Debolt are
[21:46] going to be departing and we're going to
[21:49] miss that role. Brother Tony, Sister
[21:52] Rose, God bless you. Brother Peter, I
[21:56] got it right. I almost changed his name
[21:59] to David.
[22:02] Don't call him Brother David. It's
[22:04] Brother Peter. Sister Harley and Sister
[22:07] Katherine. God bless you. We enjoyed
[22:10] having you over our home and I know all
[22:12] who have visited with you have
[22:15] uh have built a relationship and a
[22:19] treasure uh treasure your company. So
[22:22] may God give you a prosperous uh season
[22:25] and bring you back soon.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; We have an announcement that we wish to
[22:32] make.
[22:34] uh
[22:36] our brother Jean and sister Sephora Jaka
[22:41] and brother Jacques and sister Jeene
[22:46] uh Kubaluca.
[22:49] They wish to announce the marriage of
[22:52] their children.
[22:54] They are have become engaged
[22:57] Naomi
[22:59] and Justin.
[23:10] Looks like Naomi is pro promoting the
[23:14] Canadians.
[23:19] Where's Sister Naomi and Brother Justin?
[23:22] We'd like to have them stand.
[23:28] There they are.
[23:30] God bless you.
[23:37] and brother Jean Chimpaka flew all the
[23:40] way from Africa for this announcement.
[23:44] Uh that is that's real fatherhood.
[23:48] God bless you, brother Jean.
[23:50] So nice to have you here, Sister
[23:53] Sephora.
[23:55] And I didn't know but brother Justin and
[23:59] uh I believe his mother or some of his
[24:02] family were here at our 40th anniversary
[24:06] but many came and we weren't able to
[24:10] greet them all at that time. So uh just
[24:14] so if you shake hands with brother
[24:16] Justin you know that he's not a stranger
[24:18] entirely. He has been here before and
[24:22] now lives in Chicago.
[24:25] God bless you, brother Justin.
[24:28] Sister Naomi, as you make your plans for
[24:32] the future,
[24:36] I want to uh
[24:39] get directly to the word today
[24:43] and we'll ask for your kind attention
[24:46] and as little movement as possible. Uh,
[24:51] I just have been feeling so so different
[24:54] about this service. I want to preach on
[24:58] and speak on Bethl,
[25:01] the house of God's bread.
[25:03] I'd like to say something before we
[25:05] start the service and that is that I I
[25:09] really feel a very great weight upon the
[25:13] ministry.
[25:15] Whoever ministers, be it brother John
[25:17] and brother Tom, brother Tim
[25:20] or myself, whoever ministers, brother
[25:23] Kenandes and brother
[25:27] Ernie Vil Noea when he's here, whoever
[25:30] and wherever they minister, it's there
[25:34] is a great weight.
[25:36] Uh, and I'll explain this. Brother
[25:39] Brandham speaks about the and I'll be
[25:42] reading the quote. He speaks about the
[25:44] uh the compound meaning
[25:48] and it's compound because it meant
[25:51] something to the people back there in
[25:54] the Bible when it happened
[25:56] and it means something further up
[25:59] perhaps it things that were happening in
[26:02] the scripture also meant had a special
[26:06] meaning in the time of Jesus or the
[26:08] apostles the disciples and or the early
[26:11] church and then that same scripture will
[26:15] take a quantum leap and have even a
[26:18] deeper or greater meaning to this time.
[26:23] And if we don't see when we're speaking
[26:25] of that scripture, if we just stay back
[26:27] there
[26:29] uh and don't get the compound aspect of
[26:32] it, then it can't come home to you. It's
[26:35] got to mean something here today, now.
[26:39] And if we speak about the things that
[26:41] they
[26:43] experienced back there, you know, they
[26:45] lived perhaps a very rural life. So we
[26:49] think, oh yeah, well that's a lot
[26:50] different than than we are. But the same
[26:54] principles apply,
[26:57] the same things. Maybe you work for a
[27:00] corporation and you come home and you
[27:02] earn a salary and all the rest of it.
[27:04] And maybe they had cattle that were, you
[27:08] know, uh, having calves and they're
[27:11] shearing sheep and they're doing all
[27:14] those things. But work is work. Whether
[27:17] you're driving nails or shearing sheep,
[27:20] it's all work. And and then and God is
[27:24] not He's not interested whether you're
[27:27] driving a nail or washing dishes or
[27:30] whether you're going with a pot on your
[27:32] head to go and get water.
[27:34] It's it's it's irrelevant to God really
[27:37] except what is important and what is
[27:40] relevant that God meets them where they
[27:43] may where they are. God meets the people
[27:46] in maybe in the New Testament where they
[27:48] are and God meets us today where we are.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; That's what's important.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:55] So, I'd like to
[27:58] have you stand if you would,
[28:00] and we're going to ask for his special
[28:02] guidance.
[28:05] Appreciate all that are here and all the
[28:08] families that are represented,
[28:11] all the young people, children. I was
[28:14] thinking much about the families this
[28:16] morning. And uh the body of Jesus Christ
[28:21] wouldn't be what it is without every
[28:25] member of that body. And I just had a
[28:29] special appreciation,
[28:31] a special
[28:33] thanksgiving to God for the various
[28:35] families. And some perhaps are more
[28:38] visible than others, but that is not
[28:41] what's important. The important part is
[28:44] that we've been called.
[28:46] We've been called and placed into the
[28:48] body and we have been done. That has
[28:53] been done by none other than the Holy
[28:56] Spirit. He is the only one that can do
[28:58] that. And he uses various ministries and
[29:01] various experiences in our lives to
[29:04] bring that about. But that's very
[29:06] important. And the fact that you're here
[29:08] today isn't because you just figured
[29:11] that, you know, it'll be good for me to
[29:13] move or be here or be with these people
[29:16] or whatever.
[29:18] I believe and furthermore, I am
[29:21] absolutely convinced that God has
[29:24] certain times to do certain things and
[29:28] this will have a lot of meaning to you
[29:30] as we move through the scripture. So,
[29:32] let's ask you'll join with me as we
[29:35] pray.
[29:37] Dear heavenly father,
[29:40] we are feeling and sensing your nearness
[29:46] and we believe Lord you want to say
[29:48] something to us and I pray you will talk
[29:52] you'll speak
[29:54] &gt;&gt; take your word oh God and speak to the
[29:57] people
[29:58] &gt;&gt; how you know each individual one and
[30:01] you've placed such great value upon the
[30:04] lives
[30:06] You considered their value was so great
[30:08] while they sold you for 30 measly pieces
[30:12] of silver. You went in the next few days
[30:15] and gave your life blood for each each
[30:19] drop of blood. Lord, you paid for us.
[30:22] And we are not our own what we are been
[30:25] bought with a price. Not silver or gold
[30:28] or corruptible things, but with the
[30:31] precious blood of the lamb of God. And
[30:34] oh lamb of God, when there was no one
[30:36] worthy to take a book that was recorded
[30:40] and all of our deeds were recorded, you
[30:43] are not ashamed of them. We are perhaps
[30:46] ashamed of some of the deeds and the
[30:48] thoughts and the things that we've said,
[30:50] but you said, "I have the blood." You
[30:53] are a mighty man of wealth. You carry
[30:56] the wealth of the world in your new
[31:00] creation. The new creation. Oh, we thank
[31:04] you for the second Adam, the new
[31:06] creation, the very lamb of God, the son
[31:09] of God that came forth. And we're so
[31:11] thankful for the message that has
[31:13] revealed you. What a precious precious
[31:16] gift we have, Lord. While others perhaps
[31:19] are gathering today and and they're
[31:22] they're sincere. But Lord, it's more
[31:25] than sincerity. It's the grace, the
[31:28] grace of God. You came by our way, Lord.
[31:32] and we thank you for that. We pray
[31:34] you'll receive honor and glory. Bless
[31:36] the word now and bless our gathering. I
[31:39] pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:45] Thank you musicians. It'll be fine.
[31:50] I'll have you turn in your Bible,
[31:52] please, to Genesis the 28th chapter.
[31:59] And we're going to read from Genesis 28
[32:02] verse 10
[32:08] on down to
[32:10] verse 22.
[32:22] Um
[32:24] I think that what I'll do sometimes
[32:26] we're not exactly certain what we wish
[32:28] to do but I want to convey something out
[32:32] of these scriptures and so I think we'll
[32:35] read them and perhaps then just go back
[32:37] over it so you can keep your Bible open
[32:40] starting with verse 10.
[32:43] And Jacob went out from Beersa
[32:46] and went toward Haron.
[32:49] And he laid it upon a certain place and
[32:53] terried there all night because the sun
[32:56] was set. And he took of the stones of
[32:59] that place and put them for his pillows
[33:03] and lay down at that place to sleep. And
[33:06] he dreamed a dream. Behold, a ladder set
[33:09] up on the earth, and the top of it
[33:11] reached to heaven, and behold, the
[33:14] angels of God ascending and descending
[33:17] on it.
[33:20] And behold, the Lord
[33:23] And behold, the Lord stood above it, and
[33:26] said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy
[33:29] father, and the God of Isaac, the land
[33:33] whereon thou liest. To thee will I give
[33:36] it, and to thy seed. And thy seed shall
[33:40] be as the dust of the earth. And thou
[33:43] shalt spread abroad on the west, and to
[33:46] the east, and to the north, and to the
[33:48] south, and in thee, and in thy seed
[33:52] shall all the families of the earth be
[33:55] blessed. Notice now when he said that,
[33:57] and to thee and to thy seed, that seed
[34:00] that was in him.
[34:03] And just in case
[34:05] uh I wouldn't want you to just quickly
[34:09] go over that and pass it by, but I
[34:13] decided I would I would want to see how
[34:16] many germs there were in a human sperm.
[34:20] Uh and it is from a low of 20 million to
[34:24] 200 million.
[34:26] So you were not here by accident.
[34:30] It was God that gave conception.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Is that correct?
[34:35] &gt;&gt; It was God that gave conception. You
[34:38] were one of those massive mass amount of
[34:42] sperm and now here you are a living
[34:47] person born to somebody and you're in
[34:51] this service. And whether you're here by
[34:54] accident or whether you're here by habit
[34:58] is irrelevant. This may be a a a a day
[35:02] that's been chosen for you to hear
[35:05] something,
[35:07] to start something, for the Holy Spirit
[35:09] to come to you in a special way and
[35:13] maybe create a special moment.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; And that's what I've prayed for.
[35:19] to thy seed
[35:24] to thy seed.
[35:28] And behold, the Lord stood above it. And
[35:30] I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father,
[35:34] the God of Isaac, and the land whereon
[35:37] thou liest will I give it will I give it
[35:40] and to thy seed. And thy seed shall be,
[35:44] verse 14, shall be as the dust of the
[35:48] earth, and thou shalt spread abroad, to
[35:51] the west, and to the east, and to the
[35:53] north, and to the south. And in thee,
[35:57] and in thy seed shall all the families
[36:00] of the earth be blessed. And behold, I
[36:03] am with thee, and will keep thee in all
[36:06] thy in all places, whether thou goest,
[36:10] and whether and will bring thee again
[36:14] into the land, into this land. For I
[36:17] will not leave thee until I have done
[36:20] that which I have spoken to thee of."
[36:23] And he was afraid,
[36:26] and he said,
[36:28] "How dreadful is this place? This is
[36:31] none other but the house of God.
[36:36] And this is the gate of heaven.
[36:42] And Jacob rose up early in the morning
[36:44] and took the stone that he had put for
[36:48] his pillows and set it for a pillar. Set
[36:53] it up for a pillar and poured of e oil
[36:55] upon it the top of it. And he called the
[36:59] name of that place Bethl.
[37:02] But the name of that city was called L
[37:05] or LSE at the first. And LSE is a almond
[37:10] tree. It was called an almond tree. But
[37:13] he named it Bethl, the house of God's
[37:16] bread.
[37:19] And Jacob vowed a vow saying, I will if
[37:23] God will be with me and will keep me in
[37:26] this way that I go and will give me
[37:29] bread to eat and raignment to put on. So
[37:33] shall so that I come again to my
[37:36] father's house in peace. Then shall the
[37:39] Lord be my God. And this stone which I
[37:42] have set for a pillar shall be God's
[37:46] house. And all of all that thou shalt
[37:50] give me, I will surely give thee the
[37:54] 10th unto thee. The Lord bless his word.
[37:57] You may have your seats.
[38:01] The reason I hesitated between some of
[38:03] the verses and the reading was largely
[38:06] because I have uh some notes in between
[38:11] and I want to make some comments
[38:15] now.
[38:18] Um just see if I have
[38:26] brother Benham says concerning
[38:28] Bethlehem.
[38:30] Beth Bethlehem
[38:33] the name Bethl. Beth B h Beth in the
[38:38] Hebrew word means house. L E L stands
[38:42] for Elohim
[38:45] means God.
[38:47] Beth L is is Elohim which is God. The
[38:52] house of God
[38:55] where the bread of life
[38:58] laid
[39:00] means a loaf of bread
[39:03] in the Hebrews. In the Hebrew Elohim, L
[39:07] is God. Elohim
[39:10] Beth is house.
[39:13] L is Elohim. Then E L E M is bread.
[39:18] What was he? The house of the bread of
[39:23] God.
[39:24] The house of God's bread. Now
[39:30] I want to just take a moment and I think
[39:33] this is very very important for you to
[39:36] get into the life of Jacob
[39:40] at this time when he he he just came to
[39:44] this place. It was just a place to stop
[39:46] and and stay overnight. It said the sun
[39:48] was fixed.
[39:51] But this man now
[39:53] certain things had taken place in his
[39:55] life and a lot was to take place but
[39:57] certain things had already happened. One
[40:00] was he had got the blessing of the
[40:03] birthright. Brother Brandham said he had
[40:05] actually he'd actually deceived his
[40:09] his mother helped him but he deceived
[40:12] his brother his father into believing
[40:15] that he was the eldest and he got the
[40:18] birthright. The birthright friends was
[40:21] everything.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; It was the right to be in the lineage of
[40:25] the Messiah.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; And and that birthight is very
[40:31] significant for you and I. You either
[40:34] are here with the birthright
[40:36] &gt;&gt; or without the birthight.
[40:39] It may be destined for you. You perhaps
[40:43] are to be in that lineage, but that
[40:46] would be by the second birth. And that's
[40:49] why each person, each son and daughter
[40:52] of God must come by the second birth. We
[40:56] must be born into the kingdom of God. So
[40:59] now Jacob had received this birthright.
[41:03] His brother was terribly angry about it.
[41:07] Uh his brother cried out to his father,
[41:11] "Do you not have one blessing left for
[41:13] me?" and he said what I've said I have
[41:16] said and the blessing is already on
[41:19] Jacob and he couldn't reverse it. Uh it
[41:23] it uh all of these things have such
[41:25] depth and such meaning, but I simply
[41:28] want to say that this was on his mind
[41:31] and he knew that he had trouble in the
[41:34] home and trouble in the family and and
[41:38] he's uh out here in this uh desert place
[41:43] and just makes a a place to sleep and
[41:47] puts his uh head on some on some stones
[41:51] and That's where he rests. And he has a
[41:54] dream. And this dream is this ladder
[41:59] that is reaching into heaven.
[42:03] And uh not only is it a ladder reaching
[42:05] into heaven, but angels are descending
[42:08] and ascending on it. And God is at the
[42:12] top. And uh so he comes to the
[42:15] realization this is the house of God.
[42:19] And he he names it Bethl. And I'm going
[42:22] to go through the I'm going to go
[42:26] through the
[42:28] seasons of Bethl with you. And I want
[42:31] you to be able to stay with me. And if
[42:34] you are not able, you'll jot it down if
[42:38] you would jot your questions down. I
[42:40] would be happy to go back over it with
[42:43] you.
[42:47] Brother Brandham said in enticing s uh
[42:50] spirits,
[42:52] Bethl was just a pile of rocks
[42:56] laid upon one another.
[42:59] And it became the house of God, the
[43:02] dwelling place. And Jacob said, "This is
[43:04] none other than the house of God, just a
[43:07] pile of stones laying on top of one
[43:10] another. It doesn't take the great
[43:13] elaborate things. It takes the
[43:16] simplicity and faith to believe in what
[43:19] it takes. That's what makes it. And you
[43:23] have lighted upon. It says he lighted
[43:26] upon it. He he happened to come to this
[43:30] place. It wasn't anything very elaborate
[43:35] or glamorous.
[43:38] You are here this morning now.
[43:40] Uh, I'm I'm going to tie up so you'll be
[43:44] able to see from Jacob was the house of
[43:47] God.
[43:49] Jesus,
[43:51] he said, "I'm the bread that came down
[43:53] from heaven." That was the house of
[43:56] God's bread.
[43:59] And then in this day, we h you are here
[44:03] because we have received, you have
[44:05] received or you've been touched by.
[44:08] And many people have been through the
[44:12] meetings whether they're the prophets
[44:14] meetings or other believers churches or
[44:17] here. But you have been touched by the
[44:20] revelation
[44:22] of this house of God's bread.
[44:26] And the prophet of God
[44:28] was a very very unique person
[44:32] in that he was his life was to follow
[44:36] the pattern of Jesus Christ in that he
[44:41] comes out of poverty
[44:43] comes out of obscurity
[44:46] is is is just blown onto the scene with
[44:50] a supernatural ministry.
[44:53] People are coming. He didn't send out
[44:55] invitations.
[44:57] They came by the thousands and thousands
[45:00] and tens of thousands and even hundreds
[45:03] of thousands. Why? Because they were
[45:06] attracted to the fire. They were
[45:09] attracted to the supernatural.
[45:12] And then uh that they came with their
[45:15] sick. They came with their dead and
[45:17] dying. They came with uh the afflicted
[45:22] uh for years until they were wasted to
[45:24] nothing. They came expecting the they
[45:28] just knew that this God this was
[45:31] something supernatural they had never
[45:32] seen. And so the signs and the miracles
[45:36] and it seemed that there was nothing too
[45:38] difficult for this person's God.
[45:42] They were looking for answers
[45:45] that could not come from the medical
[45:48] field, could not come from their
[45:51] education. They were looking for answers
[45:54] that the psychologists and wise of the
[45:57] world could not answer. They were
[46:00] looking for answers maybe to dilemmas
[46:04] that uh the financial world couldn't
[46:08] solve. They had uh incredible
[46:12] just insurmountable
[46:15] unanswerable
[46:16] problems, questions perhaps marital
[46:20] questions as the woman at the well had.
[46:24] Perhaps other kinds of questions, maybe
[46:27] family, maybe difficulties within the
[46:30] family, things that were just insoluble.
[46:36] We are that way.
[46:39] We either are that way or we had that at
[46:42] some point in our lives. And I can tell
[46:44] you what you needed. You needed the
[46:46] bread
[46:47] &gt;&gt; of life.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; You needed the kind of bread that would
[46:51] give you strength,
[46:53] &gt;&gt; would give you hope again,
[46:55] &gt;&gt; would would answer your questions and
[46:58] and and solve these insoluble problems.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; You needed bread. Bread. God's a good
[47:07] baker.
[47:08] This is God's bread.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; This isn't some human bread from some
[47:13] bakery.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; This isn't wonder bread.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; This is supernatural bread.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; This is God's bread.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; And and and thank God that he has a
[47:26] house,
[47:27] &gt;&gt; has a place
[47:30] &gt;&gt; from which the bread comes.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; And we thank God in this generation.
[47:35] And then Jesus who was the bread of life
[47:38] said, "I will be in you."
[47:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; I will dwell in you.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; I my father will be in you.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; And I want to be able to come if I have
[47:52] time to. You are bread.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; You have You possess the bread of life
[47:59] &gt;&gt; and not for yourself only.
[48:03] It's already worked its miracle for you.
[48:05] But what about someone else?
[48:07] &gt;&gt; There's someone that you live by.
[48:10] There's someone there's somebody who's
[48:12] your peers. And regardless of your age,
[48:14] whether you're young or your teens or
[48:16] you're in your 20s or now you're a young
[48:19] couple or whatever more, there's
[48:21] somebody. Oh, it may seem like
[48:23] everything's going along fine, but you
[48:26] don't know what they face
[48:28] &gt;&gt; when they're alone.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. when they're alone in their room,
[48:33] when they're pondering the deep things
[48:34] of life, and they have to think at some
[48:37] point in time, you might be in your 20s
[48:40] today, but someday you'll you'll have to
[48:42] think about
[48:45] crossing over.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; It's appointed unto man once to die.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; And after this, the judgment, you need
[48:52] God's bread.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; You need God's bread. In case that
[48:56] sounds a very distant place from you,
[48:59] ask God just now to make it very near,
[49:03] very real, because that's the ultimate
[49:06] in as far as this life is concerned. We
[49:09] were born, we were birthed, we were
[49:11] conceived, we came into the world, and
[49:13] now here we sit and we're in this place.
[49:16] Not a very glamorous place,
[49:19] not a very special place, but we're here
[49:22] in what we call Cloverdale. Cloverdale
[49:25] was a hay seed town. Excuse the term. We
[49:28] call it Clover Gulch because it was just
[49:31] a very very plain town. This Suriri,
[49:34] this part of Suriri was kind of the uh
[49:39] not even the average man's place. This
[49:42] was the low end. And uh of course
[49:45] pressure on the land and everything
[49:47] else. We won't even get into that. But
[49:49] it became quite uh quite a good place to
[49:53] live. and everybody had to have a place
[49:55] to live. But regardless of that, people
[49:59] are people have insoluble problems.
[50:03] Every person, whether on the low end of
[50:06] the ladder or whether they're
[50:08] multi-millionaires or multi-millionaires
[50:10] or whatever more, all have enormous
[50:12] problems
[50:14] and we will continue with those
[50:16] problems. But in the midst of Satan's
[50:19] Eden,
[50:20] &gt;&gt; that's right. We have the bread of life
[50:27] &gt;&gt; and some of the secrets of that
[50:30] are in this passage of scripture.
[50:37] There's something that happens.
[50:40] It happens back there. It h it's
[50:43] happening today. It happened in Jesus
[50:46] time.
[50:48] and that is that the life and the things
[50:52] that we'll cover with Jacob and God help
[50:54] me to move forward as quickly as
[50:56] possible, but they happened in Jesus
[50:59] time.
[51:01] And I'm I'm just looking for that one
[51:04] quote. Uh I want it badly.
[51:12] It's it's uh in a message in 1965.
[51:15] Brother Brandham preached this day is
[51:17] the scripture fulfilled and brother
[51:19] Mitchell is in that meeting. I
[51:22] interviewed him at a television station
[51:25] in Rowan Oak, West Virginia.
[51:29] But he said in this message
[51:32] and he was speaking of Christ, he said,
[51:35] excuse me, how he could stand there and
[51:39] say, "This day is this scripture
[51:42] fulfilled right before your eyes."
[51:46] Now, here's a prophet in 1965 putting
[51:50] himself back in that time and bringing
[51:53] it forward. Compound meaning,
[51:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:56] And he's saying how could he say this
[52:00] day is the scripture fulfilled before
[52:02] your eyes. How outstanding. How so
[52:05] plainly. And yet those people
[52:08] misunderstood. They misunderstood.
[52:11] People today misunderstand. I hope you
[52:13] don't misunderstand.
[52:16] He said, and then he asked the question,
[52:18] why
[52:21] is because they took the interpretation
[52:23] of some order of priests
[52:27] that they were listening to. And history
[52:31] always repeats itself. Here's a phrase.
[52:36] This is paragraph 56. You may want to
[52:39] mark it in that message when you get it.
[52:42] History always repeats itself and
[52:45] scripture has a compound meaning to it
[52:49] and a compound revelation.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Has a compound meaning.
[52:57] It meant something to them when it
[52:59] happened.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; It meant something to Jacob when it
[53:02] happened when he was having this dream.
[53:04] It means something further down the road
[53:07] in Jesus time.
[53:10] I'm the bread from heaven.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; What made Jacob say, "This is the house
[53:15] of God. This is the house of God's
[53:18] bread." Well, I can tell you why. He
[53:21] received the answers to his
[53:23] incomprehensible and absolutely
[53:26] impossible questions. He received those
[53:29] answ. Wouldn't you like to receive them
[53:31] this morning?
[53:32] &gt;&gt; You're carrying some.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, he has the answer for
[53:37] it.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:41] There are some things that we're craving
[53:43] for
[53:45] and if we don't you will
[53:48] and you'll need to have the answer he is
[53:52] the bread and and something that I want
[53:55] to convey to you that when he comes
[53:58] forward when he feeds your soul on the
[54:04] answer to life and the answer to your
[54:07] insoluble
[54:08] questions, it'll they'll just evaporate
[54:12] like ether.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's a a change that comes
[54:18] over a person and you are able to not
[54:23] cope with that. That's not what I'm
[54:25] asking. That's not what I'm saying. It
[54:27] isn't something where you're able to
[54:29] cope with the dilemma. That's not it.
[54:32] It's something where he deals with the
[54:33] dilemma or where he takes control of you
[54:38] in some way. Maybe it's faith that needs
[54:41] to come in and then the faith comes in
[54:44] such a measure that he's in control.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Faith is faith comes to you to the place
[54:51] where all of your burdens we we may sing
[54:55] about it. just leave your burdens at the
[54:57] place of prayer or I leave them at the
[55:00] feet of Jesus. And we sing it and it
[55:03] sounds wonderful and it's the melody is
[55:06] lovely but to do it it's we find it
[55:10] hard,
[55:16] don't we?
[55:19] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at you. I see you smile when
[55:22] I say don't we? It's not always that
[55:26] easy. And then there are things, well,
[55:29] you say, well, uh, I've lived with these
[55:31] things for years, or I've lived with
[55:34] something without an answer for years,
[55:37] it doesn't mean he doesn't have the
[55:39] answer.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're just not able to obtain
[55:46] it. But when God steps down and does
[55:48] something and and the reason I'm able to
[55:51] preach this is because I've experienced
[55:53] these things that I'm talking about.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he lighted upon a
[56:03] place. He lighted upon a certain place.
[56:08] Nothing elaborate. Pile of stones. The
[56:11] prophet says that's what it was.
[56:15] Just a pile of stones, right?
[56:17] &gt;&gt; You should have seen when brother Don
[56:20] Alexander shoveled the first shovel of
[56:23] dirt here at this place to dedicate this
[56:26] piece of ground to the Lord. Who knew?
[56:30] Who knew that such a building would be
[56:32] put up? What's the building? Nothing.
[56:35] It's a bunch of giprock and lumber and
[56:37] nails and so on. But what what's the
[56:40] people that are in it? What's happened
[56:42] here? How many have been baptized? You
[56:44] say, "Oh, yeah. I know a lot have been
[56:45] baptized and they're here. They're there
[56:47] every we we don't care about that.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; We're not here to worry about that.
[56:52] We're we're here to be concerned about
[56:54] the children."
[56:57] &gt;&gt; And the families
[57:00] &gt;&gt; and the bread of God.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, some maybe they won't
[57:04] make it, maybe they won't." We're not
[57:07] here for that. We're here for those that
[57:09] will.
[57:11] We're here for those that are going to
[57:12] be around the marriage supper.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:17] [Applause]
[57:20] &gt;&gt; So, he lighted upon a certain place and
[57:22] and that word that's a it's an old
[57:25] English term, but it it means to light
[57:27] it upon the place to encounter
[57:30] encountered something. He wasn't
[57:32] expecting that dream. He didn't order
[57:34] that dream. It didn't say, "I'm now I'm
[57:36] going to lay my head down and yeah, now
[57:40] I'm going to have a wonderful dream.
[57:42] It's going to be used about. It's going
[57:44] to be preached about. Oh, this is a
[57:46] great great moment. This is a great
[57:48] great place." That wasn't it at all. He
[57:50] laid it upon a place and he carried
[57:52] there all night because the sun was set.
[57:55] And he took a stones. He took the stones
[57:57] of that place, that place, and placed
[58:00] them for his pillows. you know that God
[58:04] knew what was going to happen in this
[58:06] place.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; God knew exactly what was going to
[58:11] happen.
[58:13] And uh even though it was just a pile of
[58:16] stones, Bethl became a very very special
[58:19] place.
[58:21] And you lighted upon a different kind of
[58:23] a place.
[58:25] You've lighted here and you're sitting
[58:27] on some benches. You say, "Well, Brother
[58:30] Ed, you're making this just so common."
[58:33] That's exactly
[58:35] what I want to do.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; I want to make it so common. You just
[58:40] have a song service and brother Ryan
[58:43] gets up and sings and so different ones
[58:48] are musicians
[58:50] and someone's going to preach
[58:53] and uh we want something enthusiastic
[58:56] and something very exciting. Maybe God
[59:00] just wants to settle you down to the
[59:02] humrum of life
[59:05] &gt;&gt; and let your problems soak into your
[59:08] mind as they were in Jacob's mind. I can
[59:11] tell you. I'm going to go on just a
[59:13] little bit further. He lighted upon this
[59:15] place
[59:19] and then this is what happened.
[59:27] If there ever was a time when we need
[59:30] special
[59:32] special nutrition, I'm speaking now from
[59:34] my heart. If there ever was a time we
[59:36] need special strength, special
[59:39] stability,
[59:41] special insight,
[59:44] special discernment.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; It's today
[59:48] when you go into school and you you that
[59:51] are students and you've got to choose
[59:52] what am I going to do? What what will I
[59:54] take as a major? What am I going to
[59:57] major in university? And some of you are
[59:59] here and I thought of these. Some of you
[1:00:03] are here sit tash you're here from
[1:00:07] Zimbabwe.
[1:00:10] Where's Zimbabwe?
[1:00:12] I happen to know Zimbabwe to me was a
[1:00:16] place of a great burden. And from this
[1:00:19] church we poured out
[1:00:22] a lot of energy,
[1:00:25] made a lot of trips,
[1:00:27] have a lot of experiences. We won't even
[1:00:29] talk about them. But Zimbabwe young lady
[1:00:33] comes
[1:00:36] uh cuz she's intelligent
[1:00:39] gets uh
[1:00:42] per permission to come to Canada to a
[1:00:45] certain university to study certain
[1:00:47] thing and so he studies he's on her way
[1:00:51] in life
[1:00:53] parents sending her perhaps I'm only
[1:00:55] using her as example excuse me sister
[1:00:57] Tash there are many others Brother Jean
[1:01:00] Manassi, but I'm talking now about
[1:01:02] Sister Tash.
[1:01:04] And then
[1:01:07] life gets touched
[1:01:11] by something that seems to be different.
[1:01:15] Gets a taste of the bread of life.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Not us, not the ministry here.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; But she gets touched. Brother Jean
[1:01:26] Manasi gets touched, carries it into the
[1:01:29] university. Who who's who who's doing
[1:01:31] this? Excuse me just a moment. Who's
[1:01:34] who's who's guiding this kind of thing?
[1:01:37] That's
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Is this all accident
[1:01:42] or is this something divine?
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; What what should we call this place
[1:01:46] that's divine?
[1:01:51] And then you got big questions in life.
[1:01:55] And and then here's this brother Daniel.
[1:01:58] He's from the Congo.
[1:02:01] And I I just felt I needed to relate a
[1:02:03] couple things. And we're not going to be
[1:02:04] long on it, but everything changes
[1:02:08] as time goes. And and
[1:02:12] questions
[1:02:13] somehow are divinely answered from some
[1:02:16] other place
[1:02:18] and things begin to come into place and
[1:02:22] so on and so forth. You say, "Oh, well,
[1:02:24] I'm not there, but
[1:02:29] you may be where I am."
[1:02:33] When you start getting at a whole lot of
[1:02:36] different questions, you you're standing
[1:02:38] here today or you're sitting here
[1:02:40] watching someone standing behind and
[1:02:42] I've got different kind of questions.
[1:02:45] Do do I want to leave my family or do I
[1:02:49] want to leave? What happens to them? Or
[1:02:51] what am I supposed to do? What
[1:02:55] what about the church? What about the
[1:02:57] people? What about all of these things?
[1:03:02] What about those? What what about the
[1:03:04] past? What about the
[1:03:06] by the way where it started? What about
[1:03:09] how how what is
[1:03:12] what's this all about? What what what's
[1:03:15] God's plan? Then people come and people
[1:03:18] hear and
[1:03:23] you know it's not it's not an indivi.
[1:03:26] Then you find out it's not an
[1:03:30] individual.
[1:03:32] It's not a person. It's not a
[1:03:36] personality. It's not your skills. It's
[1:03:38] not your smarts. It has nothing to do
[1:03:42] with that. It has there's then then
[1:03:44] there comes a realization there's
[1:03:46] there's got to be someone and and uh
[1:03:50] Jacob excuse me but I'm taking my time
[1:03:54] and Jacob wakes up from this dream and
[1:03:58] he says this is a terrible place this is
[1:04:00] a dreadful place why was it dreadful
[1:04:04] it's the same stones he just piled up
[1:04:07] what has made it dreadful there was a
[1:04:09] presence there was something happening
[1:04:12] thing that he realized was out of his
[1:04:14] control.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; He met a god that he he met He met God
[1:04:19] and he said, "This is the house of this
[1:04:22] is the house of God. This is the house
[1:04:24] of God's bread. This is the gate of
[1:04:27] heaven.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; This is a dreadful place." Now, you
[1:04:31] might not realize that
[1:04:34] what I'm going to say.
[1:04:36] I sat in a car beside a the prophet of
[1:04:39] God. You say, "Well, that must have been
[1:04:41] wonderful." No,
[1:04:43] you got it wrong. I'm sitting there and
[1:04:47] I have questions. I got questions in my
[1:04:50] heart
[1:04:52] and I don't know which direction. I
[1:04:54] don't know. I had just gotten a job.
[1:04:57] God knew I had just gotten a job. That
[1:04:59] that's my own You're not interested in
[1:05:01] that. That's my own personal problem. I
[1:05:03] have three little babies, three children
[1:05:05] to feed and just starting school and I
[1:05:08] got I got a whole different set of set
[1:05:11] of things. You're not interested in
[1:05:12] that. Of course you're not. You got your
[1:05:14] own life. You're busy. You've got
[1:05:16] things. I'm saying my God is the same
[1:05:19] that knows your life.
[1:05:23] I irregardless of where you are in the
[1:05:25] station of life. That's irrelevant. But
[1:05:28] where you sit today is very relevant
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; because I say you're not here by
[1:05:33] accident.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; You're any more than a Jacob beside that
[1:05:39] pile of stones was not a was not an
[1:05:42] accident. God knew that place and he
[1:05:45] stopped at that place and that place
[1:05:48] became a very very special place. I am
[1:05:51] here today to say to you that this place
[1:05:54] can become a very special place to you.
[1:05:57] And some may may be sitting here because
[1:05:59] well I'm here because my parents are
[1:06:01] here. I'm here because somebody moved
[1:06:03] here. You have to wake up and find out
[1:06:06] say in your heart
[1:06:08] I didn't invent this place.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; I didn't make this place.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; God ordained it.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to regard that
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; whether it's special or not. I'm going
[1:06:21] to allow God, the God of heaven, the God
[1:06:25] of Jacob, the God of father of our Lord
[1:06:28] Jesus Christ, and yes, the God of
[1:06:30] William Brandham, that God.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; And I'm sitting in the car, and suddenly
[1:06:35] there comes one in the car.
[1:06:39] Another one.
[1:06:42] I thought I was going to die.
[1:06:46] I've had people say to me, "Oh, I know
[1:06:48] what that feels like, brother Biscll."
[1:06:50] And I just had to say to myself, "No,
[1:06:53] you don't know anything about this.
[1:06:58] This became a dreadful place.
[1:07:02] A place where a person's totally
[1:07:04] exposed. No one wants to be vulnerable.
[1:07:07] Nobody wants to be totally exposed.
[1:07:09] Nobody wants to be naked before God.
[1:07:13] No one wants to face or confront a power
[1:07:17] that knows everything about you, every
[1:07:19] secret,
[1:07:21] every thought that you've had or desire
[1:07:25] that you've had. No one wants to be in
[1:07:28] that place.
[1:07:30] And I can tell you there were people
[1:07:32] that came before brother Brandham. There
[1:07:35] was a man in Windsor, Ontario in the
[1:07:38] meeting in Windsor, Ontario,
[1:07:40] and he decided in his smarts,
[1:07:44] this man's a fake.
[1:07:47] This man
[1:07:49] invents these things, this man exercises
[1:07:53] telepathy.
[1:07:55] So, they decided and he was a a leader
[1:07:58] in a church in the church world.
[1:08:03] and we'll get down to our where we
[1:08:05] should be in a few moments. And he
[1:08:08] decided that he and another couple
[1:08:13] went for lunch.
[1:08:15] And in lunch, they decided that in fact,
[1:08:18] there's a pastor I was with in Toronto.
[1:08:21] He was in I don't know if he was in this
[1:08:23] meeting, but this man writes
[1:08:27] his doom on a prayer on a prayer card.
[1:08:34] And he wrote on a prayer card that he
[1:08:36] had tuberculosis
[1:08:38] and cancer.
[1:08:42] And when he came before brother
[1:08:43] Brandham, Brother Brandham said, "I had
[1:08:44] a gray suit on and a red tie,
[1:08:48] intelligent looking man, smart as
[1:08:50] attack."
[1:08:52] He came to the platform and he walked up
[1:08:54] and he said, "Well, just let me have
[1:08:57] your hand." And brother Brandham said,
[1:08:59] "Let me have your hand."
[1:09:03] He says, "I'm tired and I've I've seen
[1:09:05] so many visions. Let me have your hand."
[1:09:08] And I never noticed the man, but he put
[1:09:10] his hand over on mine and I said, "Sir,
[1:09:14] there's nothing wrong with you.
[1:09:16] Just go ahead."
[1:09:20] And then went on quite a dialogue and
[1:09:23] the man is saying, "No, no, no."
[1:09:25] and he opens up his shirt or something
[1:09:29] and uh
[1:09:32] and then brother Brandon finally said to
[1:09:33] him, I said, "Sir,
[1:09:36] why has the devil put in your heart to
[1:09:39] try to deceive God?"
[1:09:44] A modern Judas, I said, "You are a
[1:09:48] church of Christ." And then he said,
[1:09:49] "Excuse me." Well, I done said it. And
[1:09:53] then he went on, you are a Church of
[1:09:55] Christ preacher
[1:09:58] and you belong to the Church of Christ
[1:10:01] over in the United States.
[1:10:05] And that man sitting up there and he
[1:10:08] points to a man on the balcony
[1:10:10] with that blue suit on and your wife and
[1:10:14] his wife sitting there. You sat at a
[1:10:18] table last night that had a green thing
[1:10:22] over it spread like this and you made up
[1:10:27] that this was telepathy
[1:10:31] and you were coming tonight.
[1:10:34] And that man raised up and he said,
[1:10:36] "That's the honest truth. God have mercy
[1:10:40] on me." And I said, "Sir, you put TB and
[1:10:45] cancer on that card and now you have it.
[1:10:50] It's yours now."
[1:10:54] And he grabbed me by the pant leg and
[1:10:58] said, "I didn't." I said, "I can't help
[1:11:00] you. You go right ahead. That's up
[1:11:04] between you and God. You wrote your doom
[1:11:08] right on your card." and that you and
[1:11:12] that got him. That was all of it. He
[1:11:15] said, "When you came up, you had none of
[1:11:17] it and when you leave, you will have
[1:11:19] both of it."
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; My point is that people thought, "I'm
[1:11:24] coming to church." You know, people are
[1:11:27] going to sing songs and we're going to
[1:11:29] have some specials and we're going to
[1:11:31] have regular service and regular church.
[1:11:34] That changed very, very quickly for him.
[1:11:37] That place became a dreadful place.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to this congregation,
[1:11:45] though you may not have recognized it
[1:11:47] always, that God is this God.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; That God is our God. I want to put you
[1:11:55] on notice. That God is the God we
[1:11:57] worship.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; That God is the God we listen to.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; That God has written his word, has
[1:12:04] spoken his word. That God sent a
[1:12:07] prophet. That God sent a message. Not
[1:12:11] his message, our message. He sent his
[1:12:14] message to us through that vessel. And
[1:12:17] that's what we want it. We want that God
[1:12:21] to guide this church. We want that God
[1:12:25] to guide the school.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; We want that guide that God to guide the
[1:12:30] camp or any effort
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; and to guide the missions whatever.
[1:12:36] Is that all right?
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to continue on here
[1:12:42] for just a moment, please.
[1:12:45] You're going to have to really pray for
[1:12:46] me.
[1:12:48] Is this all right?
[1:13:14] I just I'm determined not to
[1:13:20] get confused because there are certain
[1:13:22] things that I want to bring out to you.
[1:13:25] So that's why now we've gone. I want you
[1:13:29] to keep this compound thing in mind.
[1:13:32] There we are.
[1:13:34] Jacob's on a pile of stones. And now
[1:13:38] something has happened and he said this
[1:13:40] is a dreadful place.
[1:13:46] A woman a woman comes before brother
[1:13:48] Brandan and the woman is seriously ill
[1:13:53] and she's got something like an
[1:13:55] arthritis.
[1:13:57] He said, "I see her getting stiff and
[1:14:01] oh, I see a dark shadow moving in
[1:14:04] cancer."
[1:14:06] And that cancer now that was her
[1:14:09] experience. Jacob had his experience.
[1:14:14] I described it a wee bit to you.
[1:14:17] Tremendous family problems. There's not
[1:14:20] hardly a family here, but what you have
[1:14:23] family burdens. I want to announce to
[1:14:27] you and you receive it from me. God
[1:14:29] knows exactly every burden in every way.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; And this God has the bread that can
[1:14:40] dissolve that.
[1:14:42] [Applause]
[1:14:46] And you have to come to the place where
[1:14:47] you say whatever God does it's perfect.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; It's his will.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; It's not that's not fatalism. That's
[1:14:56] trust and perfect confidence in God.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; God knows about your youth. God knows
[1:15:02] about your life. God knows about your
[1:15:05] future. And he has it absolutely in
[1:15:08] control. And say, "I'm not going to try
[1:15:10] to make it work. I'm not going to try to
[1:15:13] fix it up. I'm not going to try to
[1:15:15] manipulate it. I just trust him.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; And so he says a dark shadow moving in
[1:15:25] cancer and that cancer is in the back or
[1:15:29] spine
[1:15:31] the shadow of death. when I'm detailing
[1:15:34] this and when you hear a quote like
[1:15:36] this, don't say, "Well, hey, you know,
[1:15:38] Brother Tom or brother John or them
[1:15:40] they're speaking a quote. Brother Ed is
[1:15:43] reading a quote." That's not it. It
[1:15:45] could be you
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; and they could be saying, "Now, this is
[1:15:49] this is what you drove up and you had
[1:15:53] this and you've had an involvement or
[1:15:56] you've had a certain thing take place
[1:15:58] and you have this situation and this is
[1:16:01] your concern. This is what's weighing
[1:16:04] down in your heart. And I say God knows
[1:16:07] that. I can say that because I know that
[1:16:10] God knows every detail.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; And this is not a God that needs a whole
[1:16:18] bunch of assistance. This is a God that
[1:16:20] knows how to do things on his own.
[1:16:23] [Music]
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; And you've been given up.
[1:16:33] Nobody wants to hear that.
[1:16:40] I just come in front of a preacher. I'm
[1:16:42] in a meeting. I This is a great me
[1:16:44] healing meeting. I'm coming here for I
[1:16:46] don't know exactly what it is, but here
[1:16:48] I am.
[1:16:50] And then you come into that presence and
[1:16:54] you know this is very different.
[1:16:57] Then you have a voice saying, "This is
[1:17:00] what's happened. You're hardening up in
[1:17:02] your spine. Your spine is hardening up."
[1:17:06] And uh and uh now I see cancer moving
[1:17:09] in.
[1:17:11] Didn't want to hear that. Suddenly a a
[1:17:15] wonderful place starts to be a dreadful
[1:17:17] place.
[1:17:20] And you've been given up
[1:17:24] and there's no hope for you.
[1:17:28] They don't want to hear that.
[1:17:31] You know, we come to church.
[1:17:36] We come and we hear the song leader lead
[1:17:38] the songs and we sing the songs and
[1:17:41] we're happy over the songs and we should
[1:17:43] be. But I want to tell you,
[1:17:47] if your problems exposed, it could
[1:17:49] become a dreadful place. And then we
[1:17:51] start to sherk. We want to cover it all
[1:17:54] up. No, no, no, no. Well, don't cover it
[1:17:56] up. That's when we say that's true.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; There's something wonderful about saying
[1:18:02] that's the truth.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; That's my problem.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; One of the hardest things to say, but
[1:18:10] that's the thing to say.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Bear the thing before Almighty God. Not
[1:18:16] before man necessarily, but he said at
[1:18:19] he said, "And you cannot be well. At
[1:18:23] least that's what they told you.
[1:18:29] That's the truth.
[1:18:32] If that's right, raise your hand. And he
[1:18:34] said, "Now the doctor has done all he
[1:18:37] knows how to do." There's nothing
[1:18:40] against him. A doctor's a kind,
[1:18:43] compassionate person are doing
[1:18:44] everything they know how to do. Right.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; And he says,
[1:18:51] "But the great physician is here."
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; If I don't get anything else across to
[1:19:01] you,
[1:19:02] I desire that you may recognize a place
[1:19:07] that you come and sit
[1:19:09] or where you lay your head tonight
[1:19:13] and recall this message. And recall this
[1:19:17] statement, the solver of all dilemmas is
[1:19:22] present. And that's either the God that
[1:19:25] called you or if you've never been
[1:19:28] called, you need to be called. He's the
[1:19:30] one with the final answer. He's the one
[1:19:33] who has the solution.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not an accident of birth. I'm
[1:19:39] accident by I'm a birth by design.
[1:19:45] You recognize that?
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; In God's great economy,
[1:19:52] he designed you.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking out of burden this morning.
[1:20:00] And some of you who perhaps least think
[1:20:02] that I have had you on my heart, I have
[1:20:06] you on my heart.
[1:20:09] There's young people here that I've been
[1:20:12] very very burdened for. See a direction
[1:20:15] that you're headed.
[1:20:29] God knows that.
[1:20:32] And God wants to stop you where you're
[1:20:35] at.
[1:20:38] You have may perhaps migrated here or
[1:20:41] immigrated.
[1:20:43] You may have come from other countries.
[1:20:46] You feel because you're from another
[1:20:48] country, it's essential to make a mark
[1:20:51] in the world. No, it's not.
[1:20:54] It's essential to be what you are
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; and to be who you are
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; by the grace of God. That's what's
[1:21:01] important.
[1:21:17] I'm just going to
[1:21:20] take my time
[1:21:22] and if I have to continue I'll do so at
[1:21:25] another time.
[1:21:31] For instance, brother be brother
[1:21:33] Brandham uses this example.
[1:21:36] For instance,
[1:21:38] please stay with me.
[1:21:40] Like it says in the Bible that out of
[1:21:42] Egypt,
[1:21:44] this is a very important point. That's
[1:21:46] why I want to go back to it. Out of
[1:21:49] Egypt have I called my son. Referring to
[1:21:53] Jesus.
[1:21:55] And if you run in the margin on that,
[1:21:58] you find out also referred to Jacob.
[1:22:03] When I saw that, I had to actually
[1:22:07] search it out to see how many times
[1:22:09] brother Brandham referred to that or was
[1:22:11] that just something that he had missed.
[1:22:14] Uh, excuse me. I'm not saying something
[1:22:17] that he had missed, but sometimes he
[1:22:19] uses a name that perhaps
[1:22:22] didn't refer to that person. And he said
[1:22:25] it referred to Jacob. Same scripture.
[1:22:28] Jesus. And when he said this, this
[1:22:32] become a heart of my message. That's why
[1:22:35] I really want your attention.
[1:22:38] Jesus was his greater son.
[1:22:41] Jacob was his son that he called out of
[1:22:45] Egypt,
[1:22:47] but Jesus was his greater son. And then
[1:22:50] I begin to see
[1:22:55] the compound meaning and the compound
[1:22:58] revelation.
[1:23:01] And I feel very very humbled right now
[1:23:06] because
[1:23:07] this is a message that has called out
[1:23:09] the greater woman.
[1:23:13] This is a message that revealed to me
[1:23:16] the greater son.
[1:23:21] I didn't know I didn't know that this
[1:23:23] son's name should be used in baptism.
[1:23:28] And many of you come here and you didn't
[1:23:30] know that either. Many of you have gone
[1:23:32] into this tank and you've been baptized
[1:23:35] in the name of the father, son, and holy
[1:23:37] ghost. A title, title, title.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; You weren't baptized in any name.
[1:23:43] A title, title, title. And three titles
[1:23:46] don't make a name.
[1:23:48] Amen.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; But you failed to know until God sent a
[1:23:54] prophet to pull the covers off and show
[1:23:57] that one of the greatest church
[1:23:59] organizations on earth where actually
[1:24:02] Satan crept in there. The same Satan
[1:24:06] that was in Eden, he crept into Eden and
[1:24:08] then he hid away and he took away the
[1:24:11] name of Jesus. They hated the name of
[1:24:14] Jesus to have the power that he has. All
[1:24:19] the power of heaven is invested in that
[1:24:21] name and we are baptized and we go to
[1:24:25] his death
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; and we come up in his resurrection
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; and we become the uh the vessels of of
[1:24:33] his life,
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; his life in us.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; And he is the bread of life. Amen.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you friends, some of your
[1:24:44] family,
[1:24:46] some of your associates, if they're even
[1:24:49] going to find eternal life, they'll find
[1:24:52] it in you.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; They'll see it in you. That's exactly
[1:24:56] the truth.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; And we know that the preaching of the
[1:25:00] gospel, but it may be you might preach
[1:25:02] from him a servant without them even
[1:25:04] realizing it.
[1:25:07] And he says he was the greater son.
[1:25:11] Jacob was his son
[1:25:14] that he had called out of Egypt.
[1:25:17] Scofield makes that reference also. He
[1:25:20] said Jacob was called out and Jesus was
[1:25:24] called out. And so also all and so is it
[1:25:29] today.
[1:25:32] Jacob was called out.
[1:25:36] Jesus was called out.
[1:25:38] And you have been called out. Come out
[1:25:41] of her, my people, and be ye separate,
[1:25:44] sayaeth the Lord, and you've been called
[1:25:47] out. See you hand raised brother Joseph.
[1:25:51] I I thought of you. I thought of the
[1:25:54] people that came out of the colony. I
[1:25:57] thought of the you people that have come
[1:26:00] out of various colonies and so on. We
[1:26:02] don't know what kind of separation that
[1:26:04] was and the separation was severe.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; And when you came into his presence, it
[1:26:11] became a dreadful place. I have this
[1:26:14] decision. Do I leave people? You see
[1:26:17] people sitting here you forgive me but
[1:26:19] don't forgive me because there's a
[1:26:23] reality
[1:26:24] I I bearing burden with people I never
[1:26:29] forget the day. How am I to forget the
[1:26:32] day? I don't forget the day. And brother
[1:26:34] Joseph and sister brother Joe Walder and
[1:26:37] sister Eileene walked in to the log
[1:26:40] church and great tears coming down. Not
[1:26:44] that the tears moved, but it they
[1:26:46] couldn't be stopped and coming down
[1:26:49] Sister Eileen's face. And she said,
[1:26:52] "These are not tears of sorrow. These
[1:26:55] are tears of joy." And to think that
[1:26:58] they flew out about 1,500 miles with a
[1:27:01] shopping bag or a few things and they
[1:27:04] weren't allowed to take a thing. You
[1:27:05] talk about a separation, friend.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; And I can guarantee you the bread of
[1:27:11] life was worth it all. Amen.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Just one taste of the bread of life.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; And we may look at it casually. It
[1:27:22] wasn't casual. Hearts were torn.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Mother's heart was torn.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Families hearts were torn.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; And that's the kind of thing that was
[1:27:34] taking place even in Jacob's life. God
[1:27:37] help me.
[1:27:44] Bethl today can be a far different place
[1:27:48] for you than the rest of the world.
[1:27:52] Now this was a pivotal I put this as a
[1:27:55] pivotal message.
[1:27:57] Jacob's experience is referred to in the
[1:28:01] present terms and in this message it is
[1:28:04] is this a sign of the end sir?
[1:28:09] Is this the sign of the end?
[1:28:13] That message and uh immediately
[1:28:15] following that within about 90 days
[1:28:19] is the angels
[1:28:22] say, "Well, there's all kinds of debate
[1:28:23] about the angels." Oh, bushwah nonsense.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; I couldn't care about all the debate of
[1:28:29] the angels.
[1:28:31] Were the seals preached?
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; And did they reveal something? Amen. Who
[1:28:39] cares about where they were? Were they
[1:28:41] at the top or were they at the bottom?
[1:28:43] Are they coming up? Are they going down?
[1:28:45] Or did they appear here? Are they didn't
[1:28:47] they appear on the on the 28th? I don't
[1:28:50] I couldn't care less about all of their
[1:28:53] sematics and detail and all their
[1:28:56] logistics. What I care about is that
[1:28:59] people say, "Well, we got to find the
[1:29:01] rocks where his head was and we got to
[1:29:05] we got to have this. We got to have
[1:29:07] that." and and Roman Catholic Church has
[1:29:09] the has the nails that were in his
[1:29:11] hands. That doesn't mean anything unless
[1:29:14] you have the blood that came from his
[1:29:16] side wash you and make you clean and
[1:29:20] make you a son of God and daughter of
[1:29:23] God and receive the same spirit that he
[1:29:26] received.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Am I over your head?
[1:29:33] Thank you.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; And in this message,
[1:29:45] he said, "You are God." He's speaking in
[1:29:47] prayer now. You are God
[1:29:50] and there is no other but you.
[1:29:53] Receive us, Lord. I'm saying that. I I
[1:29:57] pray this as to myself. I pray it now
[1:30:00] for you.
[1:30:02] Receive us, Lord. Forgive us our sins.
[1:30:06] I'm repenting for all my unbelief,
[1:30:10] for all my in iniquity.
[1:30:14] I plead for the altar of God. I plea on
[1:30:17] the altar of God. This is a spirit of
[1:30:20] Elijah,
[1:30:22] God's prophet.
[1:30:35] As I come tonight with this little
[1:30:37] church and here you are
[1:30:42] and I included you in this prayer. As I
[1:30:45] come tonight with this little church
[1:30:46] before me, by faith we move from this
[1:30:50] building in rapture. As we sit together
[1:30:54] in heavenly places around the throne of
[1:30:58] God, our hearts have been warmed many
[1:31:02] times in the things that we've seen you
[1:31:06] do
[1:31:07] and unfold
[1:31:09] your mysteries to us. But Lord, tonight
[1:31:14] I'm all weary.
[1:31:17] Woe is me.
[1:31:20] And Jacob,
[1:31:22] when he saw those angels coming down
[1:31:26] the ladder and going back, he said,
[1:31:30] "This is a dreadful place, none other
[1:31:34] than the house of God."
[1:31:36] And there Bethl was established.
[1:31:44] There's something friends that I'm not
[1:31:46] able perhaps to convey to you.
[1:31:50] But the reason they call bread the staff
[1:31:52] of life I expect is because that is what
[1:31:55] it is.
[1:31:57] If you have
[1:31:59] bread physically
[1:32:02] that's wonderful. But this morning,
[1:32:05] spiritually throughout this entire
[1:32:08] building,
[1:32:10] you may be a visitor.
[1:32:12] You may be a stranger. There may be some
[1:32:15] that have journeyed here.
[1:32:18] You may be an old-timer. You're not old
[1:32:23] an old-timer anymore than I am. But I've
[1:32:26] come here
[1:32:28] this morning
[1:32:30] to eat of the bread of life.
[1:32:35] Do we want answers? Yes, we want
[1:32:38] answers.
[1:32:40] Do we need leadership? Yes, we need
[1:32:42] leadership.
[1:32:44] Do we need to be guided? Yes, we need to
[1:32:46] be guided. Which one of you young people
[1:32:51] don't need an answer? You all need
[1:32:53] answers.
[1:32:57] Yes, you need answers.
[1:33:00] Should
[1:33:02] I be doing this or should do you know
[1:33:04] what
[1:33:06] just uh
[1:33:09] I want to speak very directly.
[1:33:13] If you just commit your way
[1:33:17] to the Lord
[1:33:20] and set up a relationship with him
[1:33:24] and talk to him on a regular basis
[1:33:29] and tell him what he means to you.
[1:33:34] If you do that,
[1:33:37] it will be a lot better for you in life.
[1:33:43] And I will continue on with this.
[1:33:54] And there Bethl was established.
[1:33:57] God, people don't understand that. This
[1:34:00] is a prophet in prayer. Listen.
[1:34:03] And there Bethl was established.
[1:34:07] I hope you you've been so kind and
[1:34:09] you're giving me your attention.
[1:34:12] But I want you to hear what he says.
[1:34:14] God,
[1:34:15] people don't understand that.
[1:34:18] They think it would be so much joy.
[1:34:22] But Lord, what a weary.
[1:34:26] What a dreadful thing for a human being
[1:34:29] to come into the presence of a great
[1:34:33] mighty being of heaven.
[1:34:36] And I put in big letters, he is near.
[1:34:43] Because I had the confidence, I had the
[1:34:46] witness that he is near.
[1:34:50] You know, God has done some
[1:34:53] remarkable things
[1:34:59] in our lives, in our home, in our
[1:35:02] church, in your life. And I begin to go
[1:35:06] over the various lives of individuals.
[1:35:12] And I thought of some that are here that
[1:35:14] have been you young people.
[1:35:19] I I'd like to see your hat. Who has and
[1:35:22] who goes presently to BCA?
[1:35:27] May I just see your hands? Please raise
[1:35:30] your hands high.
[1:35:33] You have gone or you go.
[1:35:42] Anyone down here? Go to BCA. You have
[1:35:46] gone. Raise them up high so we can see
[1:35:49] them.
[1:35:54] God bless you.
[1:35:57] You know this.
[1:36:03] I thought of the people
[1:36:06] in this place
[1:36:08] that were on their knees
[1:36:12] working. the sisters that were working
[1:36:15] and and made a place. Maybe you don't
[1:36:17] think of it, but they made a place.
[1:36:22] They made a place where
[1:36:25] any any time I was able to be there, I
[1:36:28] thought we just make a place to keep
[1:36:31] these kids out of
[1:36:34] all those evil stories.
[1:36:41] and the kids of the world
[1:36:44] and there are things that they think are
[1:36:46] jokes
[1:36:48] and Satan wants to creep in
[1:36:52] and he wants to make them acquainted
[1:36:54] with you know the world and the ways of
[1:36:57] the world and the conversation of the
[1:36:59] world and I thought you know just every
[1:37:03] time we're able to do something just
[1:37:04] think I'm just batting him one I'm just
[1:37:08] socking him one just going to keep these
[1:37:10] kids out of his hands and keep them out
[1:37:13] of their grip. And you think that wasn't
[1:37:16] a wonderful thing? That was glorious to
[1:37:18] me. And I just began to thank God for
[1:37:21] the various families and God put it in
[1:37:23] the heart of different people to just do
[1:37:27] something. It It's not everybody, but
[1:37:29] it's somebody. And we all contributed
[1:37:32] one way or another, but one but
[1:37:38] all these little things maybe they seem
[1:37:42] so small to someone. someone just sends
[1:37:44] a a maybe a faith challenge report
[1:37:47] someplace or touches somebody's heart
[1:37:50] and maybe someone is streaming the
[1:37:52] service right now and we don't know
[1:37:54] exactly the meetings in Switzerland just
[1:37:57] keep coming up and I keep thinking about
[1:38:00] it and how how God I go back now I'm
[1:38:04] going back to Jacob but I go back in my
[1:38:07] mind to little things and little places
[1:38:10] that you stopped and you thought things
[1:38:13] over and uh you begin to see I have a I
[1:38:17] have a picture of myself but I don't
[1:38:20] even know who took it but I was just
[1:38:23] nailing some footings around where the
[1:38:25] old log church is going to sit. I'm not
[1:38:28] I'm just not lost in my memory. This
[1:38:31] isn't melancholy. This is things that
[1:38:33] happened.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; A lot of people worshiped there. A lot
[1:38:38] of souls baptized there. And and now I
[1:38:42] understand there's going to be some
[1:38:43] baptized tonight. Is that true?
[1:38:46] God bless you.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; God bless those that are being baptized.
[1:38:51] That's why it's been built. That's why
[1:38:53] men labored. That's why people gave so
[1:38:57] that you could be baptized in a place in
[1:39:00] a place. And if God hasn't raised up
[1:39:03] this place, then let it collapse.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Let it be for eternity or for nothing.
[1:39:09] Right.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; That's my burden.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; And why did the message come? So, are
[1:39:20] you all right for a little bit longer?
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to take you
[1:39:24] through a series of uh if we could just
[1:39:29] turn the
[1:39:31] screen down a little bit.
[1:39:33] I want to take you through the
[1:39:35] progression just quickly.
[1:39:38] We go from Jacob's experience. I want to
[1:39:42] take you through and it may not just be
[1:39:45] so wonderful.
[1:39:48] You say, "Oh, we we we quote things that
[1:39:51] the prophet of God has said and the
[1:39:53] things which he did."
[1:39:56] None of that quote is of any value
[1:40:00] unless it comes in a compound from 50
[1:40:03] years ago or 60 years ago to you today.
[1:40:08] right today.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; I know this is different from my usual
[1:40:25] ministry.
[1:40:28] Can we just dim these lights up here a
[1:40:30] wee bit more, please?
[1:40:33] Abraham built an altar
[1:40:35] east of Bethl unto the Lord. This isn't
[1:40:38] a bunch of information now. This is just
[1:40:41] to take the progression of Bethl because
[1:40:44] I have something to say about it at the
[1:40:46] end.
[1:40:48] Abraham returns to Bethl to the place of
[1:40:53] the altar that he had made at the first
[1:40:56] and there Abraham called on the name of
[1:40:59] the Lord. I just want to say one thing.
[1:41:02] You that have sat perhaps at some place
[1:41:05] in this building and at some point in
[1:41:08] time you felt his presence and you felt
[1:41:12] very almost swallowed up or surrounded
[1:41:16] in his presence. I say to you in the
[1:41:20] name of the Lord Jesus Christ that is
[1:41:23] not to be a single event.
[1:41:27] I say you have returned. You're here
[1:41:30] today. You have returned. But he had a
[1:41:34] certain specific thought in his mind. I
[1:41:37] will return there.
[1:41:40] I will go to that altar.
[1:41:43] I will go to the place where I made that
[1:41:47] altar or I made that consecration. And
[1:41:51] there Abraham called on the name of the
[1:41:54] Lord. It's not just enough to perhaps
[1:41:58] sit here and enjoy the presence, but
[1:42:01] say, "Oh God, I'm reaching out to you."
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; In Genesis 28:19 is where we read today
[1:42:12] where Jacob slept and dreamed of a
[1:42:14] ladder reaching into heaven with angels
[1:42:17] ascending and descending. He was afraid
[1:42:20] and said, "How dreadful is this place?
[1:42:23] This is none other but the house of God
[1:42:26] and this is the gate of heaven. And he
[1:42:28] called the name of that place Bethl.
[1:42:32] That city was called at the first
[1:42:38] during this interval. Now here I need
[1:42:42] your full attention and I thank you for
[1:42:44] it.
[1:42:47] There's an interval
[1:42:49] and we often forget about the intervals.
[1:42:53] This interval was 20 years
[1:42:56] minimum 20 years.
[1:42:59] 20 years
[1:43:02] for where he had this experience.
[1:43:05] During this interval, Jab Jacob worked
[1:43:08] 14 years for his two wives, Rachel and
[1:43:11] Leah.
[1:43:12] Prospered in herds of sheep and cattle.
[1:43:16] had many difficulties and family
[1:43:18] problems. Many, many, many problems that
[1:43:23] you don't want in your family, but Jacob
[1:43:25] had them during this interval. and
[1:43:29] prevailing envy between his wives
[1:43:33] over ch childbearing
[1:43:36] disagreements with his father-in-law and
[1:43:39] brothersin-law
[1:43:41] had wages changed 10 times
[1:43:46] had very difficult partings
[1:43:50] Genesis 31 and13
[1:43:53] God says I'm the god of Bethl
[1:43:56] nevertheless regarding Regardless of
[1:43:58] what was happening with Jacob, he said,
[1:44:00] "I'm the God of Bethl, where thou
[1:44:03] anointest the pillar, and where thou
[1:44:05] vowest a vow unto me. Now arise, and get
[1:44:09] thee out from this land, and return unto
[1:44:12] the land of thy kindred."
[1:44:16] You want to stay very alert because I
[1:44:19] have I'm coming. I'm going to shoot the
[1:44:22] other wad right at the end.
[1:44:27] Genesis 35 and1. And God said unto
[1:44:30] Jacob, "Arise, and go up to Bethl, and
[1:44:33] dwell there, and make there an altar
[1:44:36] unto God, that that appeared unto thee
[1:44:39] when thou fled from the face of Esau thy
[1:44:42] brother." And 35 and3, "And let us arise
[1:44:46] and go up to Bethl," he says, "and I
[1:44:49] will be there. I will make there an
[1:44:52] altar unto God who answered me in the
[1:44:56] day of my distress and was with me in
[1:45:00] the way which I went.
[1:45:03] In 35 and 6 Jacob came to Bethl he and
[1:45:07] all the people that were with him.
[1:45:12] 35 and8
[1:45:14] Deborah Rebecca's nurse died and was
[1:45:17] buried there at Bethl and Jacob 35 and
[1:45:22] 15 and Jacob called the name of the
[1:45:25] place where God spake with him Bethl you
[1:45:29] see what things are happening this is an
[1:45:31] incredible place an incredible place and
[1:45:35] a prophet your prophet goes right back
[1:45:38] to that place and speaking of the
[1:45:41] atmosphere here and the kind of place
[1:45:43] that it was and that where it will
[1:45:46] always be and and here I am. I'm in this
[1:45:49] place. This is a message that you've
[1:45:51] received.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; In 35 and 16 and there's three verses.
[1:45:59] And they journeyed from Bethl and there
[1:46:02] was but a little way to come to Ephroth.
[1:46:06] And Rachel travailed, and she had hard
[1:46:10] labor. And it came to pass when she was
[1:46:14] in hard labor, that the midwife said
[1:46:17] unto her, "Fear not, thou shalt have
[1:46:21] this son also. And it came to pass as
[1:46:25] her soul was departing, was in
[1:46:27] departing, for she died, that she called
[1:46:31] his name Benoni."
[1:46:34] Benoni.
[1:46:36] But his father called him Benjamin,
[1:46:40] son of the right hand. Benoni is the son
[1:46:43] of my sorrows.
[1:46:46] And he changed his name to Benjamin.
[1:46:50] Now Jacob had 12. This was after
[1:46:55] after
[1:46:57] Bethl.
[1:46:58] After he slept there. Now he has
[1:47:02] Benjamin.
[1:47:04] That's not history, friends.
[1:47:07] Now you have a message. The message that
[1:47:09] you love. The message that you dwell in.
[1:47:13] The message that you say is my call. The
[1:47:16] prophet of God is calling all the time
[1:47:19] and saying
[1:47:20] Joseph's heart burned for Benjamin.
[1:47:25] There was something yearning for young
[1:47:28] Benjamin. And that is that group, that
[1:47:31] last group of the Jewish people that
[1:47:33] will come. And the message is absolutely
[1:47:36] full of that. He's looking for Benjamin.
[1:47:39] Here we're sitting as Gentiles. Here
[1:47:42] we're sitting right now. But God's eye,
[1:47:45] he said that now the next thing is
[1:47:48] Israel. God turning to Israel. Turning
[1:47:51] from the Gentiles. We're Gentiles,
[1:47:53] friends. We're we're brothers. You're
[1:47:57] ministering.
[1:47:58] I'm I'm preaching this morning, but I
[1:48:01] want to say to this waiting people,
[1:48:03] we're a dying civilization. As far as
[1:48:06] God is concerned, God is turning from
[1:48:10] the Gentile or has turned from the
[1:48:13] Gentiles, as far as a massive movement
[1:48:16] is concerned to come to and and and to
[1:48:19] turn to the Jewish people. I heard on
[1:48:23] the radio last night or yesterday
[1:48:27] sometime
[1:48:29] you heard brother Brandham say it's
[1:48:30] three minutes to midnight
[1:48:33] and I heard that it's less than that
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; and then they said that they the clock
[1:48:38] that has ticked closer
[1:48:43] to the destructive time this morning I
[1:48:47] think it was I don't listen to news but
[1:48:50] I think it was the last thing last night
[1:48:52] listen friends. They said that this
[1:48:56] morning. Yeah, that's where they they
[1:48:58] said that this morning they're going to
[1:49:00] have a program at 10:00 a.m. on the
[1:49:04] Canadian Broadcasting Corporation about
[1:49:08] the danger.
[1:49:10] how we have moved so close to the danger
[1:49:15] of a complete they weren't even saying
[1:49:18] world war but a total nuclear
[1:49:21] catastrophe.
[1:49:23] Friends, we're sitting here in our
[1:49:25] comfort and so on. You young people, it
[1:49:29] may not always be this way. You want to
[1:49:32] be anchored to the rock of ages. This is
[1:49:35] not a fear trip. This is reality.
[1:49:37] There's people here that have gone
[1:49:39] through very, very difficult times.
[1:49:41] People here who know what war is and
[1:49:44] they know what civil war is. And they
[1:49:47] know there are countries just a few
[1:49:49] miles away by air and you'll be there
[1:49:53] and you'll find it's been been
[1:49:55] destructive places.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Some of you children, your father and
[1:50:01] mothers have come out of that. Others
[1:50:04] have not. has been just fine. But I find
[1:50:08] in the lives of these people, it went
[1:50:10] along fine for a season and then a
[1:50:13] difficulty came or death came and war
[1:50:16] came and famine came and starvation
[1:50:19] came. We want to be able to say, "You're
[1:50:22] the God. You're the bread that came from
[1:50:24] heaven. and you'll feed me whether I'm a
[1:50:27] widow in the famine or whether I'm
[1:50:30] living in the palaces of of Egypt as
[1:50:33] Moses did.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; We want to know that our God is God.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; We don't come here ceremoniously to
[1:50:44] church. We come here to feed upon the
[1:50:47] word of God, the eternal message of the
[1:50:50] hour.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:56] And so she had the last son, Benjamin.
[1:51:03] Then Joshua, God's great general, fought
[1:51:07] battles even against Bethl. Oh,
[1:51:12] things are changing.
[1:51:17] The king of Bethl was one that Joshua
[1:51:20] captured.
[1:51:23] Oh,
[1:51:26] it's gone a long ways from Jacob having
[1:51:29] a rest and saying this is the house of
[1:51:32] God.
[1:51:34] Joshua's
[1:51:35] Judges 1 and 22 in the house of Joseph
[1:51:38] they also went up against Bethl and the
[1:51:41] Lord the Lord was with them.
[1:51:49] in Samuel. Prophet Samuel went in
[1:51:52] circuit each year to Bethl, Gilgal and
[1:51:57] Mispa
[1:51:59] and judged Israel.
[1:52:03] Things deteriorated
[1:52:05] under King Solomon.
[1:52:07] Israel was divided under two kings,
[1:52:11] Jerobom. And Jerobom was a son of
[1:52:15] Solomon's servant. and he was a mighty
[1:52:18] man of valor.
[1:52:20] And Riabom, who was Solomon's own son,
[1:52:24] and Solomon's own son only had two
[1:52:27] tribes, and Jeroboam had 10. That were
[1:52:31] the 12 tribes that was torn apart. And
[1:52:36] Jeroboam made two golden calves because
[1:52:39] he saw he saw, you know, how subtle this
[1:52:42] is. He he he reasoned politically. Well,
[1:52:46] if if there only one if there's only one
[1:52:49] calf or there's only one ark or there's
[1:52:51] only one temple and the people all go to
[1:52:54] Jerusalem because God preserved
[1:52:57] Jerusalem to Riaboam. And if they always
[1:52:59] go to Jerusalem, then their hearts are
[1:53:02] going to be drawn that way. Or if they
[1:53:04] always go to Cloverdale Bible way, their
[1:53:06] hearts will be or if they go to another
[1:53:08] church or if they go to someplace else,
[1:53:10] maybe their hearts will be there. We're
[1:53:12] not into politics,
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; quite frankly. You go wherever you are
[1:53:18] fed.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; We're just not into politics. Not into
[1:53:22] politics.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; I detest politics.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Politics corrupt something that's pure.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; I believe a prophet says every
[1:53:36] government is of the devil.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it. And if a
[1:53:41] government involves the military,
[1:53:43] involves a immigration, involves a
[1:53:47] economy, involves a taxation, involves
[1:53:50] Yeah, you'll find the enemy there
[1:53:52] someplace. But I'm not attacking that
[1:53:54] one. It's it's this is Satan's kingdom,
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; So he set up one and made two golden
[1:54:05] calves. Jeroboam did. and he set up one
[1:54:08] in Bethl and the other he put in Dan. In
[1:54:13] other words, if the people are down
[1:54:14] there, it's a little too far to go
[1:54:16] across the borders, etc., etc. It's too
[1:54:19] far and it's just too much headache. So,
[1:54:21] we'll just put one down there and make
[1:54:23] it more comfortable, make it more easy
[1:54:25] or or whatever it might be. I'm not
[1:54:27] making any fun. I'm not making any joke
[1:54:30] of anything. I'm just saying the the
[1:54:32] politics get in and say, "Well, we'll
[1:54:34] sooner have it this way so that it'll be
[1:54:37] easier for the people." It's not always
[1:54:39] the easiest way is the right way.
[1:54:45] And incidentally, friends, I probably
[1:54:47] can't preach it the way it should be
[1:54:49] preached, but the Bible is just rife
[1:54:54] with the phrase, "The sins of Jeroboam."
[1:54:58] That's right.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; And this was the son.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; It made it easy to worship.
[1:55:05] And then it says in Kings, "And behold,
[1:55:09] there came a man of God out of Judah by
[1:55:11] the word of the Lord unto Bethl. And
[1:55:14] Jeroboam stood at the altar to burn."
[1:55:17] And he wasn't to be at the altar to burn
[1:55:20] to begin with. He wasn't a priest. He he
[1:55:24] was a king that had been put in charge.
[1:55:27] And he stretched out his hand when this
[1:55:30] man of God came in. Doesn't even name
[1:55:32] him. Stretched out his hand and his hand
[1:55:35] froze. And then he calls out if this man
[1:55:39] can pray for him so he can withdraw his
[1:55:41] arm. And Jerobom stood by the altar to
[1:55:46] burn incense. Now we have the wrong
[1:55:47] people. I can tell you friends, this may
[1:55:50] not be what you wanted to hear, but part
[1:55:53] of the ailment that even ails within the
[1:55:56] message is people behind the pullpit
[1:55:59] that are not called to be behind the
[1:56:01] pullpit.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen one more time?
[1:56:06] And the congregation knows, they can
[1:56:09] sense that something's missing. And
[1:56:12] that's what's missing. It's not gifted
[1:56:15] people. is not people who have a flurry
[1:56:18] of words and that's not that's not the
[1:56:21] basis. The basis is that the burden of
[1:56:24] the word of the Lord is there to call
[1:56:26] those people and to feed those people.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; And that's what needs to happen.
[1:56:36] And the sons of the prophets try to
[1:56:39] persuade Elijah from following Elijah.
[1:56:44] And the sons of the prophets that were
[1:56:46] at Bethl.
[1:56:48] The sons of the prophets. These are sons
[1:56:51] of prophets that were at Bethl.
[1:56:55] They came forth to Elisha who had the
[1:56:58] spirit of Elijah upon him and said unto
[1:57:02] him, perhaps not yet the spirit of
[1:57:04] Elijah in the same way because he's
[1:57:06] following Elijah. and knowest thou that
[1:57:09] the Lord will take away thy master from
[1:57:14] thy head today? And he said, "Yay, I
[1:57:17] know it. Hold your peace." In other
[1:57:20] words, don't detain me. Don't dis don't
[1:57:22] Don't Don't restrain me. I'm following
[1:57:25] Elijah at a very desperate time. I don't
[1:57:29] know if this is meaning anything to you,
[1:57:31] but I say to these people and naysayers
[1:57:34] and whatever more, don't don't try to
[1:57:38] stand in my way. I have a call of God
[1:57:42] and I must follow this uh spirit, this
[1:57:45] spirit of Elijah. Are you feeling that
[1:57:48] way, friends? Are you convinced? Are you
[1:57:50] feeling that way?
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; And God finally speaks. This is in the
[1:57:57] prophet Amos.
[1:57:59] But seek not Bethl, nor enter into
[1:58:03] Gilgal, and pass not to Beersa,
[1:58:07] uh, for Gilgal shall surely go into
[1:58:11] captivity, and Bethl shall come to not.
[1:58:23] is a picture of Bethl.
[1:58:32] Your elder people,
[1:58:35] your mature people,
[1:58:39] you can shut this down now.
[1:58:46] It's not being ready for the wonderful
[1:58:48] moments,
[1:58:50] but it's being being prepared
[1:58:53] for difficult
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; difficult times. Are are you preparing
[1:58:57] us for difficult times? No. If they
[1:58:59] happen to come to you,
[1:59:06] if they happen to come to you,
[1:59:09] say, "Oh, this message say okay. Uh,
[1:59:14] what are you what are you trying to say,
[1:59:15] brother Biscll?" This is what I'm trying
[1:59:17] to say. the
[1:59:22] uh
[1:59:24] the compound meaning
[1:59:27] I find where the word of God had
[1:59:30] glorious and wonderful beginnings.
[1:59:33] I'm not done. I'm going to take my time
[1:59:36] just a few more moments. Had wonderful
[1:59:39] beginnings and I felt very very burdened
[1:59:42] to take you directly. I took I spent
[1:59:46] probably the last two weeks taking this
[1:59:48] Bethl nothing house of God's bread. This
[1:59:52] is the gate of heaven. This is the house
[1:59:54] of God. And take it through. Are you
[1:59:58] listening friends?
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; And take you all through the scripture
[2:00:02] until finally God says, "Don't pray for
[2:00:06] it anymore.
[2:00:08] I'm done with it."
[2:00:10] He's not done. He's the God of the
[2:00:12] message,
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; right? He's not done with the message.
[2:00:16] What the people made out of it.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; We're not here and we're we're standing
[2:00:22] against that. People want to make it
[2:00:25] some some glamorous big thing and
[2:00:28] whatever more. You understand? And but
[2:00:30] I'm I'm I've got a very important thing.
[2:00:33] Please stay with me now. Very close.
[2:00:36] Don't let your mind get weary.
[2:00:39] And God allowed that.
[2:00:44] Jacob didn't even know how to pray for
[2:00:46] that moment. He didn't know how to pray
[2:00:49] for that. He didn't know how to ask all
[2:00:51] his problems. He has you. You You've got
[2:00:54] something here. Just like saying, "You
[2:00:57] got the blessing of the birthright." Oh,
[2:01:00] wonderful.
[2:01:01] Now, all he has is trouble. His brother
[2:01:04] hates him. His brother wants to kill
[2:01:06] him. He's running for his life.
[2:01:10] uh big problems in the family. The
[2:01:14] mother helped him to deceive this his
[2:01:16] brother and all of these things. I I got
[2:01:19] the blessing. I got the birthright. Oh,
[2:01:20] I got the message. He certainly did
[2:01:23] have.
[2:01:27] I'm glad that you're real quiet.
[2:01:33] Says, "Oh, we got the message. We got
[2:01:35] the message. This is what the prophet
[2:01:36] did. This is what he said. this is where
[2:01:38] he went and all these things and we all
[2:01:40] get caught up in all of those things and
[2:01:42] oh, we're going to put it on the desk.
[2:01:44] We're going to put it in a book. We're
[2:01:45] going to translate it and we're going to
[2:01:47] do all of these things and we all get
[2:01:49] all caught up in those things and people
[2:01:51] finally get it and groups are
[2:01:53] established and evangelism's going on
[2:01:56] and then then then it's this way then
[2:01:58] it's a broadcast then it's a you know
[2:02:01] whatever and it's it starts to take on
[2:02:04] the appearance of
[2:02:06] just what to come out of
[2:02:14] And finally, it it if you just let
[2:02:17] something go, that's why you have to
[2:02:19] have the kind of ministry you have. You
[2:02:22] have something go, it has to just keep
[2:02:23] chopping,
[2:02:25] keep chopping, keep moving the people
[2:02:29] and and don't don't have any resistance
[2:02:31] to it. Just say, "God, thank you for a
[2:02:35] clear word. Thank you for burdened men.
[2:02:40] Thank you, oh God, that you deal with us
[2:02:42] as children. Thank you for chastising us
[2:02:45] when we need chastisement. Thank you, oh
[2:02:48] God. Thank you for feeling the weight.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; We're going to follow you in the heat.
[2:02:54] We're going to follow you in the good
[2:02:55] times and in the bad times. We're going
[2:02:57] to follow you.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:06] And then when it came to that,
[2:03:12] see there was a time when the church
[2:03:14] world,
[2:03:16] you know, everything was setting
[2:03:18] missionaries everywhere and doing all
[2:03:21] those kind of things. It got built up
[2:03:23] into churches, then into Bible schools
[2:03:25] and setting out all kinds of ministers
[2:03:28] and setting them out whether they were
[2:03:30] called or uncalled or not called. We're
[2:03:33] just sending them out and we did every
[2:03:35] kind of every possible way. I mean, we
[2:03:38] had new inventions and television
[2:03:41] programs and whatever more. I was with
[2:03:43] the prophet.
[2:03:45] He he arrived. He said, "I just come
[2:03:47] through Tulsa." He said, "And I was in
[2:03:50] uh I went to visit Oral Roberts."
[2:03:54] And he said, "I was in his office. Oh
[2:03:56] my." He went like this. Oh my. He said,
[2:03:58] "That was such a such a place." He he
[2:04:02] was describing the ceiling kind of
[2:04:04] aluminum strips or something on the
[2:04:07] ceiling and he said what a place. He
[2:04:09] said he said it would cost uh
[2:04:13] you know hundreds of thousands of
[2:04:14] dollars perhaps a day just to keep the
[2:04:17] operation going. He said I he said I
[2:04:21] wouldn't even know what to do with a
[2:04:22] thing like that. I wouldn't know what to
[2:04:24] do. He said just
[2:04:27] said, "I'd be out of my mind trying to
[2:04:29] support something like that."
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; And he and then he said, "I I I I think
[2:04:39] I have a a chair and a desk in in my
[2:04:42] office."
[2:04:44] And what was in my heart is just give me
[2:04:47] the chair in the office. Give me that
[2:04:50] little desk. We don't need some big
[2:04:52] elaborate thing and things going on.
[2:04:55] That's why you may wonder you come into
[2:04:57] the office and so on. Come into the
[2:04:59] church. I'm happy, brother Matthew.
[2:05:02] Every time I'm using a washroom or
[2:05:04] washing my hands, I'm just so thankful
[2:05:06] to you and all the brothers and team
[2:05:08] that worked and uh made it so nice.
[2:05:13] We're we're glad for that. We're glad
[2:05:15] for that.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; But that is not our focus. That is not
[2:05:19] our focus. We try to keep things simple
[2:05:22] and want to keep things humble. Want to
[2:05:24] keep things so that God is pleased with
[2:05:27] it.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; But I still think God's word and God's
[2:05:30] message requires the best.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; That's just in our heart is the very
[2:05:35] best.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Do I have a few more moments?
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:53] The prophet of God saw
[2:05:59] this is what happened
[2:06:04] when Bethl come to its end. Don't even
[2:06:08] pray for Bethl anymore.
[2:06:13] Then you say, "What's the answer to
[2:06:15] this? What is the answer? You think that
[2:06:19] people there was no more God's people?"
[2:06:21] Yeah, there were God's people. They were
[2:06:23] just crushed.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Now, what do we Now what do we do?
[2:06:30] And then there was a baby born.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; His name, you shall call his name Jesus.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; For he'll save his people from their
[2:06:40] sins. Here come a ray of light. Here
[2:06:43] come a little bit of hope. And here come
[2:06:45] But he didn't come the way anybody
[2:06:47] thought he was going to come. And he
[2:06:49] comes
[2:06:51] and finally one day he says, "I'm the
[2:06:53] bread
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; that came down from heaven."
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; And they they had to wake up and say,
[2:06:59] "Well,
[2:07:01] what we've heard in what we've heard in
[2:07:03] the priests, what we've heard in the
[2:07:05] synagogue isn't right.
[2:07:08] Yes, sir.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Now, we hear he's the bread that came
[2:07:10] down from heaven. And they're calling
[2:07:12] him a fanatic. And they're calling him
[2:07:13] this, calling him that. I I'm I'm I'm
[2:07:17] perhaps going slow, but just going slow
[2:07:20] so you'll get it in your mind. I'm the
[2:07:22] bread that came down from heaven.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Now, we come. I'm just leaving that.
[2:07:28] Now, I'm coming to our age. I'm taking
[2:07:30] another compound meaning. And here we
[2:07:33] are. We've gone all the way from Jacob.
[2:07:35] Now, here we are. And the churches, they
[2:07:38] have the Dian council and they have all
[2:07:40] these council. We won't even t take time
[2:07:43] to talk about it. And the and the church
[2:07:45] and great churches and whether it be
[2:07:49] orthodox or whether it be and there's
[2:07:51] finally one denomination after another
[2:07:54] till they have so many denominations
[2:07:57] and then you talk about the ecumenical.
[2:07:59] Maybe you folks don't know what
[2:08:00] ecumenical means. You know what it
[2:08:03] means? They're coming together.
[2:08:06] How do you get strength from uniting
[2:08:10] weaknesses?
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; How do you come up with a correct answer
[2:08:15] from just putting together all your
[2:08:18] mistakes?
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; And all your questions.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother Frank. It's just
[2:08:26] impossible.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; And and and I'm not I'm not a smart guy.
[2:08:30] I'm a simple guy. guys looked at all his
[2:08:33] all his ecumenical invited to the
[2:08:35] ecumenical this and ecumenical that and
[2:08:38] we'd like to interview you from the
[2:08:40] ecumenical newspaper and so on. I said,
[2:08:43] "Well, you can interview me, but you
[2:08:45] cannot print just part of it. You have
[2:08:47] to print it all." And they wanted to
[2:08:50] question me on the Godhead. And so I
[2:08:52] went all through the scripture and when
[2:08:54] I was before I was done, I said, "Where
[2:08:56] did you people even get the Trinity?"
[2:08:59] Yeah.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, then they start backpedaling.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; You know what? They didn't print any of
[2:09:03] it cuz I put them on notice. You can't
[2:09:06] print just part of it. You have to print
[2:09:08] it all.
[2:09:12] And in the midst of that, here's little
[2:09:14] people. I know because I can speak from
[2:09:17] the burden of my heart. Saw all these
[2:09:20] things taking place and saw great
[2:09:23] manifestations of the Holy Spirit. saw
[2:09:26] things happen that haven't even maybe
[2:09:28] happened in this church or in the in in
[2:09:31] the amongst the message believers. And
[2:09:33] yet and yet I see there's a quality a
[2:09:37] distinct quality uh quality of the word
[2:09:41] a quality of revelation. What what is
[2:09:44] revelation? Revelation's when you see
[2:09:46] something, you experience it. It's so
[2:09:48] real, you can't take it away. Try and
[2:09:51] tell Jacob he didn't have that dream.
[2:09:55] Try and tell the people of of William
[2:09:58] Brandham's day you weren't in that kind
[2:10:00] of meeting. Try to tell me I wasn't in
[2:10:02] that.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Try to tell me I wasn't sitting and
[2:10:05] seeing those things that I didn't see
[2:10:07] the blind girl that I wasn't in Tacoma
[2:10:10] and and saw Indian boy called out about
[2:10:13] 10 12 years old and he totally blind and
[2:10:17] received his sight. I saw him walking to
[2:10:19] the water fountain the next day or two.
[2:10:21] Try and tell me I wasn't enemy. Of
[2:10:23] course, we're in that meeting. But are
[2:10:25] we following this because of that? No.
[2:10:28] Because the word of God opened up. Uh I
[2:10:33] mean friends, you you some of you
[2:10:35] perhaps don't know what the serpent seed
[2:10:37] the serpent seed when I came to that was
[2:10:39] a dreadful place.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Not a dreadful doctrine. a dreadful
[2:10:44] place to come to when you discover
[2:10:46] everything you put your faith in and
[2:10:49] your confidence in and you've gone to
[2:10:51] church and you've sang songs and you've
[2:10:54] worshiped with the people and then
[2:10:56] suddenly that's all stripped away.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; How many know what that means?
[2:11:11] And the prophet of God
[2:11:13] from
[2:11:16] hundreds of thousands, so many in
[2:11:18] Bombay, they can't get near the place.
[2:11:22] Durban, South Africa,
[2:11:25] so many Houston, Vernon, British
[2:11:29] Columbia,
[2:11:30] thousands of people lined up. I stood
[2:11:34] there lined up as a young fellow your
[2:11:38] age, 14.
[2:11:41] I stood in a lineup four deep. Thought
[2:11:44] I'll never get into this building.
[2:11:50] Try to tell me you didn't you didn't
[2:11:51] experience I experienced that. Now here
[2:11:53] we come. We toodel in and park our car
[2:11:56] and
[2:11:57] if it's raining we can go into Port
[2:11:59] Kosher and come in and things are nicer.
[2:12:03] We don't want to make sure they're
[2:12:04] nicer. We want to make sure they're
[2:12:06] better.
[2:12:07] We want to make sure that the spirit
[2:12:11] of whom I speak of, the God of Jacob,
[2:12:15] the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
[2:12:17] and the God of Jacob is in this place
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; meeting with the people, talking to the
[2:12:22] people, and that the people are are are
[2:12:26] responsive and they're ready not just to
[2:12:28] say amen, but they're saying, "I give
[2:12:30] myself to that. I surrender myself.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; And they said he called upon the name of
[2:12:36] the Lord. I want I wanted to find out
[2:12:37] what they called. And the Bible says the
[2:12:39] call is the call out on the name of the
[2:12:42] Lord.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; And I saw Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.
[2:12:46] And they made an altar. They didn't just
[2:12:48] make an altar and whisper a prayer. They
[2:12:50] called out on God.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; Oh God. God of my fathers. And I say the
[2:12:58] God that sent the pillar of fire. The
[2:13:00] God that spoke out of a tree and said to
[2:13:03] a boy, "Don't defile your body in any
[2:13:05] way. When you're when you're older,
[2:13:07] you'll have a work to do." I want to
[2:13:09] say, "Oh, God, I'm part of that work
[2:13:11] that he had to do." He had to speak to
[2:13:14] me. He
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; had to speak to a people. That's why
[2:13:18] we're here.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; You say, "Amen."
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Has he spoke to you?
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to know. Has he spoke
[2:13:26] to you?
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Has he opened up his word to you?
[2:13:31] Have you felt him?
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; I have felt him. I know that he's near.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; I know that he's near to speak. I know
[2:13:39] that he's here to say something. I've
[2:13:42] seen people's lives changed.
[2:13:44] Transformed. Totally transformed.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; He's taken the weak.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; He's taken the feeble. He's maybe taken
[2:13:54] those that are illiterate or those that
[2:13:56] are wise. He's taken us Oh friends,
[2:13:59] we're failures, but we're success in his
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; in his sight.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; And God let uh uh Israel go down into
[2:14:10] such deterioration and degradation. God
[2:14:13] even said, "I turned from her. Don't say
[2:14:16] anything more about Bethl, about the
[2:14:19] house of God." Why? Cuz there was
[2:14:21] another one rising. There was another
[2:14:24] sun rising. It was called Jesus Christ.
[2:14:27] And then he ended up hanging on a cross
[2:14:29] for the sins of the world. And the
[2:14:31] people didn't understand. Believers
[2:14:33] didn't understand it.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; And they fled and they hid,
[2:14:38] but they still believed it. And the
[2:14:40] prophet of God said, he said it over and
[2:14:42] over. And this must be a lesson to us.
[2:14:45] They did not understand it. They could
[2:14:48] not understand it. And they could not
[2:14:50] explain it, but they believed it. There
[2:14:53] are things about this message I cannot
[2:14:55] understand. And there's things about
[2:14:58] this message that I cannot explain. But
[2:15:01] there's things those same things I
[2:15:03] believe.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; And you don't believe because you're
[2:15:08] gullible. You believe because there's
[2:15:10] something in here that's saying it's
[2:15:12] true. It's true.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is true, friends.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; It is true. I'm speaking with
[2:15:25] conviction.
[2:15:27] And then came a time and I lived in the
[2:15:31] time. I know something about the
[2:15:33] confusion of the time. If you want to
[2:15:35] ask me, I can describe it for you. I can
[2:15:39] tell about when the church world went
[2:15:42] into such chaos,
[2:15:46] such confusion.
[2:15:49] They asked me and my wife
[2:15:52] and our daughters
[2:15:54] would we come to this meeting.
[2:16:00] There was a kind of a strange move. I
[2:16:03] had been introduced.
[2:16:06] I'd been introduced to the message.
[2:16:11] I'd seen the prophet of God. But
[2:16:14] friends, let me say something. I don't
[2:16:16] want you to misunderstand it. But we saw
[2:16:19] miracles.
[2:16:22] Not not just in the message. We saw
[2:16:24] miracles. And you have to understand
[2:16:26] something. You have to understand the
[2:16:28] message. The prophet of God says that
[2:16:32] faith
[2:16:33] faith is a law
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; and people exercise faith. He says women
[2:16:40] will come up before him and a godly
[2:16:43] sainted sister misses it. Right.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; And a prostitute comes up and gets it.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; That's not our kind of mathematics, but
[2:16:53] that's God's kind. I got a law
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; and you believe me, you'll get it.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; You're sick, you have a law. And that's
[2:17:02] why many times Catholic people get
[2:17:05] healed so quickly because they simply
[2:17:07] believe it. or native people. You go to
[2:17:10] around the native Indian people and they
[2:17:12] just believe it and you pray for them
[2:17:14] and they have all kinds of miracles that
[2:17:17] happen. That's miracles is not the
[2:17:19] thermometer. Miracles is not the
[2:17:21] examination. And so we saw the miracles
[2:17:24] happen. So I've seen miracles happen
[2:17:26] there and I see him in William Bran's
[2:17:28] meetings and so on and so forth.
[2:17:32] But he said the sign has a voice. He
[2:17:35] also said that. So we begin to listen to
[2:17:38] the voice and oh that took us all took
[2:17:41] took a few of us on a very different
[2:17:44] direction.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; We're following a voice now.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; That's different. Would I trade the
[2:17:50] voice for the miracles? Not a chance.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; Not a chance.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; Not a chance.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; Listen to that voice.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's bread.
[2:18:05] I declare to you I have encountered the
[2:18:08] solver of questions.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; I declare to you that he is present
[2:18:14] here.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; I declare to you that you can meet him
[2:18:17] here.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; And you can commit your life to him
[2:18:21] here.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; This place can become a wonderful place
[2:18:24] and this place can become a dreadful
[2:18:27] place. But whatever God chooses, give
[2:18:30] yourself to this place or not a not a
[2:18:33] church building, but this place where
[2:18:36] God identifies and says, "I'm present.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; I'm present.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; I'm here to do what you think's
[2:18:43] impossible to do." Listen, friends, we
[2:18:46] do not want to continue on week after
[2:18:48] week and month after month and year
[2:18:50] after year with the same insoluble
[2:18:52] problems. I want you to take a hold of
[2:18:54] that problem and say, "God, you're the
[2:18:57] answer.
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; You're the solution."
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; He knows what it is to be a teenager.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; I know some of you teenagers going
[2:19:07] through struggles. He knows what it is
[2:19:09] to be a teenager.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; He knows what it is to be mistreated.
[2:19:15] He knows what it is
[2:19:19] in a country to be considered
[2:19:25] illegitimate.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not inferring that anyone is.
[2:19:34] I'm inferring that he bore it all.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; He knows what it's all about. You say,
[2:19:39] "Well, I'm unique." It's nothing unique.
[2:19:42] He suffered it all. He bore it all.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; He knows what what it's all about.
[2:19:51] Listen friends, there isn't a complex in
[2:19:53] the world. There isn't a complex that
[2:19:55] you bear that he hasn't got the
[2:19:57] solution. Not up in the future right
[2:19:59] here now. This is a place. This is why
[2:20:03] I'm preaching. This is a place. This is
[2:20:06] a moment.
[2:20:10] People
[2:20:14] say, "Well,
[2:20:16] you don't understand what I've been
[2:20:18] through. You don't understand what I've
[2:20:19] been through either."
[2:20:23] We're not talking about those things. We
[2:20:26] don't want sympathy.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; We don't want accolades.
[2:20:31] We just simply want to be brothers and
[2:20:33] sisters.
[2:20:35] I so respected that man of God stand
[2:20:38] there in his humility. Stand there and
[2:20:41] know that the people across the street,
[2:20:43] they didn't want to walk on the same
[2:20:45] side of the street as William Brham did
[2:20:47] or the Brandham family. They didn't have
[2:20:50] a good name. God brought them out of
[2:20:52] that.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; You know why? There was a greater
[2:20:56] ministry.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; Do you know why I'm preaching now? There
[2:21:01] was a greater work.
[2:21:03] You know why? There was a greater voice.
[2:21:06] There was a greater message. And the
[2:21:09] message was a call. A greater call. Not
[2:21:12] one from back there. Not one from
[2:21:14] Pentecost, but one of today. A greater
[2:21:17] call for a greater woman.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; Now it's the wife.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; It's the wife. We had an announcement of
[2:21:26] of sister Naomi and brother Justin. But
[2:21:29] this is a greater call than any man is
[2:21:33] almighty God saying to his son and his
[2:21:37] son says in the message of saying to
[2:21:39] him, "Go get my son a wife."
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; And he said it wasn't easy.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; He sweated it out
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; until he found character. Amen.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; And you people are here. He found
[2:21:56] character.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; He didn't find the mess of your life. He
[2:22:00] found character.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; We've been in all kinds of messes. We've
[2:22:03] been all kinds of defeats and
[2:22:05] difficulties, but he looked for
[2:22:07] character.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God, brother Daniel. He found
[2:22:12] character.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; He searched over Congo, pulled you out.
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; He searched over the countryside. He
[2:22:22] searched over the Pacific Northwest. And
[2:22:26] here we are, friends. We're testimonies
[2:22:28] to his grace
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; because he's searching a greater woman,
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; a greater message,
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; sir.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; A greater voice. Yes, sir.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; And a greater s and a greater woman.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; I must call her. I must call her. And
[2:22:45] some of you came from the maybe came
[2:22:47] from the Philippines. I don't care where
[2:22:49] you came from. You come from the Congo,
[2:22:51] you come from Africa, wherever you come,
[2:22:53] that has that's irrelevant to me. And
[2:22:56] wherever you come, say, "Well, my folks
[2:22:58] moved." I say, "Brother West was from
[2:23:00] Arizona and so on. Some of you come from
[2:23:03] all different places." Yes. Did you come
[2:23:05] because we have nice weather? No,
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; we don't have good weather. Do you come
[2:23:12] because everything is nice and the
[2:23:14] economics are nice? No. It's tough. It's
[2:23:16] hard. I've even told people to stay
[2:23:18] away. But somehow friends, if you have a
[2:23:21] diet, you have a something craving
[2:23:24] inside and you've got to have a certain
[2:23:27] diet. You got to have a certain kind.
[2:23:30] And one thing I do know and I say to the
[2:23:33] brothers that minister here, I desire
[2:23:35] with all my heart and soul, and I've
[2:23:38] said it so many times to the brothers,
[2:23:41] and we pray it in this study. We pray it
[2:23:44] because we believe it. Feed the sheep.
[2:23:48] Feed the sheep.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; Feed them on what? The bread.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; This became its
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; Bethl.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not a pile of stones, but
[2:23:59] this became a Bethl. Not a fancy place,
[2:24:03] but this became Bethl.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; And I'm not at all ashamed that this
[2:24:13] started in a house. It's not the house.
[2:24:16] It's not this place. There's no other
[2:24:18] place. But I sat on on planks that were
[2:24:21] unplaned, on blocks of wood. And I
[2:24:24] thought, "Oh my, even when I was sitting
[2:24:27] there, oh my, wouldn't a bank manager
[2:24:31] like to see me now, here I am with all
[2:24:33] these young people and street people and
[2:24:37] street fighters and bike riders and
[2:24:39] whatever more they were. But God was
[2:24:42] there
[2:24:44] [Applause]
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; from a messed up life."
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; From a messed up life. And now we come
[2:24:51] from different countries. We come from
[2:24:53] across the ocean. We come from different
[2:24:55] languages. We come from all kinds of
[2:24:58] different places. But I want to say one
[2:25:00] thing. God called you here. You've had
[2:25:05] all kinds of circumstances.
[2:25:08] God called you here. God arranged for
[2:25:11] you to be in this service. God arranged
[2:25:14] for you because he wants you to know
[2:25:16] that there is no difficulty outside of
[2:25:20] God's control. And we want to be a
[2:25:23] church of faith.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; We believe it.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, my situation's
[2:25:33] impossible." I say to you, in the name
[2:25:35] of the Lord, nothing shall be called
[2:25:37] impossible with God. Nothing shall be
[2:25:40] called impossible with God. Say, "Well,
[2:25:43] I don't see how it's going to happen."
[2:25:45] You don't see, but he knows.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. May we give glory to God.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; We come to this place
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; where the altar has been built
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; and the altar has been restored. Our
[2:25:59] prophet's message has restored it and we
[2:26:01] say glory be to that God.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; What do you think about it first?
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; We think about is it the truth? Yeah,
[2:26:23] maybe somebody needs to let go.
[2:26:28] Let go.
[2:26:32] Is God dealing with something to let go?
[2:26:36] Let go of that complex. Let go of that
[2:26:39] difficulty.
[2:26:42] Some people don't get healing.
[2:26:45] Don't take me wrong. But some people may
[2:26:48] not get healing because they're busy
[2:26:50] talking about their disease and sickness
[2:26:52] all the time.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; We're not here to glorify that.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; We're here to glorify the healer.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; My Jesus carried it all.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; My Jesus, there isn't a chain that he
[2:27:02] hasn't broken.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've come here from cages
[2:27:06] of the devil.
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; Where Satan has held us, but we're free.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; We're free. Amen.
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; I feel very very exercised at this
[2:27:16] moment. You're free.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; You should be able to raise your hand
[2:27:25] like that, young man. I'm free.
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; I'm free.
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; I'm free.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[2:27:39] Glory be to that God. We've come into
[2:27:42] this place to meet that God
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; and that is we do not come here in vain.
[2:27:47] We come here with a purpose.
[2:27:50] [Applause]
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; You come in here tonight with having had
[2:27:54] prayer. Say, I'm expecting,
[2:27:57] oh God, you shall move the man of God
[2:27:59] tonight. You shall move the word in him
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; and he shall scatter out the word and we
[2:28:06] are here to partake.
[2:28:10] [Music]
[2:28:11] Oh God,
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; if you feel to stand
[2:28:18] and be included in a prayer, we're going
[2:28:21] to include everybody.
[2:28:24] But if you feel to stand,
[2:28:29] I've come to a decision. I come to
[2:28:31] deciding place.
[2:28:35] I don't need you to stand, but perhaps
[2:28:37] you need to.
[2:28:39] Oh, Father.
[2:28:43] Oh, Father God,
[2:28:50] it's not so important that we love you,
[2:28:53] but that you love us.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; You love us, oh God.
[2:29:03] Yeah. The people have heard many times
[2:29:06] in different ways
[2:29:09] of how honored and privileged we are.
[2:29:12] But even more than that, Lord, we can
[2:29:14] never we can never fully assimilate
[2:29:19] and get in our mind.
[2:29:22] You had us in your mind.
[2:29:25] You had us in your mind. As a songwriter
[2:29:27] says, when you hung on the cross,
[2:29:30] you had us in your mind.
[2:29:33] You had me in your mind, Lord.
[2:29:36] And I just couldn't find the answer.
[2:29:39] Searched everywhere.
[2:29:42] Searched everywhere. Traveled many
[2:29:44] places.
[2:29:46] But you had you had the answer all the
[2:29:48] time. You were just waiting till that
[2:29:51] hunger matured.
[2:29:53] And perhaps, oh God, in the hearts and
[2:29:56] the lives of the individuals
[2:29:59] that I've searched here and I've
[2:30:00] searched there
[2:30:02] and I've kept searching.
[2:30:05] I kept calling out and you were with me,
[2:30:08] beside me, near me all the time.
[2:30:12] Lord, I want to say,
[2:30:14] oh Lord Jesus,
[2:30:17] come very near.
[2:30:20] Come very near to us. I need you. We
[2:30:22] need you. The congregation needs you, oh
[2:30:25] God. Those that are streaming need you.
[2:30:29] Go out, I pray, Lord. How we thank you
[2:30:31] for what you've done and what you're
[2:30:34] doing in Switzerland and the precious
[2:30:37] people that I'll never never ever can
[2:30:39] forget how you spoke. You spoke of the
[2:30:43] wounded ones and how you sent healing.
[2:30:47] The bread of life came near.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; The eternal bread of And now they've
[2:30:52] come. They've come from so many
[2:30:54] countries over 20 countries. They've
[2:30:57] come. We're not enthused about the
[2:30:59] gathering so much of the people, but
[2:31:02] we're enthused that hungry people can
[2:31:04] come and eat of the bread of life and
[2:31:08] find find that their answers are their
[2:31:11] questions are answered and their souls
[2:31:14] are fed. Lord, the people stand today.
[2:31:19] We are in a place, Lord, some of us may
[2:31:22] have a dilemma. We're not going to walk
[2:31:24] out the doors with this dilemma. We're
[2:31:27] going to say, "Here it is. I lay it down
[2:31:30] at your feet. I'm laying it here now. Oh
[2:31:33] God. Oh God, you're the God of Abraham.
[2:31:38] You're the God of Isaac. You're the God
[2:31:42] of Jacob. You're the God that answers
[2:31:45] all questions. You're the God and father
[2:31:48] of our Lord Jesus Christ. You're the God
[2:31:52] of the prophet of God of William Brham
[2:31:55] in this age. You're the God, oh Father,
[2:31:59] that wants to be looked upon.
[2:32:02] Lord, I sense that people are curious
[2:32:05] about that. But you're the living God.
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; You're our God.
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. We look to you. Come
[2:32:14] amongst us now, Lord Jesus, and confirm
[2:32:17] it, I pray. Do confirm it, oh God.
[2:32:23] Would you sing with me, Brother Ryan?
[2:32:25] I'm thine, oh Lord. I've heard thy
[2:32:27] voice.
[2:32:29] [Music]
[2:32:31] I am thy
[2:32:34] ro.
[2:32:37] I have heard thy
[2:32:41] voice and
[2:32:44] thy love to me.
[2:32:52] I long to rise

[2:33:01] faith, oh God,
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; and be closer
[2:33:05] [Music]
[2:33:08] to thee.

[2:34:27] in love.
[2:34:30] [Music]
[2:34:32] Draw me nearer,
[2:34:35] nearer,
[2:34:38] nearer. Blessed Lord to the cross where
[2:34:45] thou

[2:35:12] We're going to close this part of the
[2:35:14] service in prayer.
[2:35:17] I pray that
[2:35:19] he will linger very near you.
[2:35:22] I pray for you young men,
[2:35:25] men of the congregation
[2:35:29] that you'll settle it in your heart.
[2:35:34] you're going to live your life to be a
[2:35:37] glory to this God
[2:35:41] [Music]
[2:35:42] is that God isn't somebody is way off in
[2:35:45] the distance. God is here.
[2:35:49] He's the same one who said
[2:35:52] this
[2:35:53] is Bethl. This is my house.
[2:35:57] He's not talking about some corrupted
[2:35:59] sand doom.
[2:36:01] He's talking about a living place to
[2:36:03] living people
[2:36:05] saying to this congregation
[2:36:08] throughout this congregation speaking to
[2:36:11] you,
[2:36:14] this calls for more
[2:36:16] than just a church.
[2:36:18] This calls for more
[2:36:21] [Music]
[2:36:22] than association.
[2:36:24] [Music]
[2:36:26] This calls for something more. God bless
[2:36:29] you.
[2:36:30] Young people, I say to you, give you a
[2:36:34] charge in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:36:36] Christ. You carry on with this
[2:36:43] that God has done
[2:36:46] and let your life be a true witness
[2:36:50] of the true vine. Jesus said, "I am the
[2:36:54] vine." Be a true witness of that vine.
[2:36:58] Let your life
[2:37:00] be a true witness.
[2:37:06] And anything that might unhinder
[2:37:09] the thing,
[2:37:11] anything that might hinder,
[2:37:14] you may not understand that, but
[2:37:15] anything that might hinder, I curse it
[2:37:18] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:37:21] God curses it in the name of Jesus
[2:37:23] Christ.
[2:37:25] Nothing shall hinder the work of God.
[2:37:29] [Music]
[2:37:30] And it will be said that she is a
[2:37:32] glorious church
[2:37:35] without spot. Somebody has to be without
[2:37:37] spot or wrinkle. Not by the world, not
[2:37:40] by the human view,
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; but by the supernatural view of Jesus
[2:37:45] Christ. So you've been loyal to me.
[2:37:48] You've loved me. In spite of it all,
[2:37:52] you've loved me. That means more than
[2:37:54] everything, anything. God bless you. I
[2:37:57] want to have just a word of prayer.
[2:38:03] Father, how I thank you for the people
[2:38:05] that are here,
[2:38:07] the people that are streaming,
[2:38:11] part of this service.
[2:38:14] They have participated in. They have
[2:38:16] been the hearers of the word. And now,
[2:38:20] Lord, I send them from this place that
[2:38:21] they might be the doers of the word. We
[2:38:25] are not hearers only, but we are doers
[2:38:27] of the word. I pray that you will take
[2:38:30] every man, woman, and child within the
[2:38:33] sound of my voice and in this sanctuary
[2:38:38] that this might indeed be, oh God,
[2:38:42] Bethl, the place of God's bread,
[2:38:46] God's house,
[2:38:49] not this wooden structure, but the human
[2:38:53] structure. These bodies that you have
[2:38:56] built, we give them to you in total
[2:38:59] surrender. We say, "I am thine, O Lord,
[2:39:04] and I have heard thy voice." And now,
[2:39:07] Lord, because we are yours and we've
[2:39:09] heard your voice. We pray that you will
[2:39:12] follow us, be with us,
[2:39:15] &gt;&gt; as we have need of. I pray in the name
[2:39:18] of Jesus Christ that every person will
[2:39:22] have met you in a special way in Jesus
[2:39:25] name.
[2:39:28] We dismiss you. God bless you each one.
[2:39:34] You're dismissed and free to go.
[2:39:40] [Music]
[2:41:35] Oh,
[2:41:39] [Music]
[2:42:03] heat.
