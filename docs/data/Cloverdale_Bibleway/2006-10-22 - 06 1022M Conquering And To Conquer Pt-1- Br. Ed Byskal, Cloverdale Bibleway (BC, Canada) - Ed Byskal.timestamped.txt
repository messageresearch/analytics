[16:42] here this morning from our brother
[16:44] Claude's Sigman said we pray for uh we
[16:48] play prayed for brother Claude's
[16:50] sister-in-law.
[16:52] She went home the next day from a very
[16:54] serious car accident. It has been a
[16:57] witness for Claude's brother. a seed has
[17:00] been planted. So, we just want to thank
[17:02] the Lord and and pray that God would
[17:05] continue. Amen. To speak to this family.
[17:09] Uh our brother Lyall Black is requesting
[17:12] prayer for his stepgrandson. He was
[17:14] admitted to hospital in Vancouver for a
[17:17] psychiatric evaluation. We want to pray
[17:19] for deliverance. And we know we serve a
[17:21] God that can deliver. Amen.
[17:24] And uh there's a request that came in by
[17:26] email um from Sister Angie Brown. I am
[17:32] in need of prayer for my parents from
[17:33] George and my husband. I don't know what
[17:35] to do. I want to forgive and be set free
[17:38] from depression. Amen. So let's join our
[17:41] hearts with our sister this morning. And
[17:44] uh if you've got a need this morning,
[17:47] you just take it before the Lord as we
[17:48] go to prayer. If you're listening in on
[17:50] the internet this morning, you've got a
[17:52] need, you just take it before the throne
[17:54] of grace as we come before him this
[17:55] morning. Amen. Brother Tom,
[18:00] precious Lord,
[18:03] we love you this morning. We love your
[18:05] presence. We love your people. We love
[18:08] to be found in the house of God. Lord,
[18:10] we feel like Philillip this morning.
[18:12] Show us the Father and it would suffice
[18:14] us, Lord. God, open our eyes to see your
[18:16] glory amongst your people again and that
[18:19] we could cry out, Lord, within our own
[18:21] heart, "Pass me not, oh gentle Savior.
[18:25] Speak to us individually, Lord Jesus.
[18:28] Take the word of God that we will hear
[18:30] this morning, Lord. And God, plant good
[18:33] seed within our soul. Father, there's a
[18:36] people out in the world today. They do
[18:39] not know whom they worship, but we
[18:41] worship you, the living God, this
[18:43] morning. And so, Father, with uplifted
[18:46] hearts and hands, we worship you, Lord.
[18:49] May it be pure worship. May it be holy.
[18:52] May you be pleased to dwell amongst us.
[18:54] May it not just be lip service this
[18:56] morning, but out of the depths of our
[18:58] soul. We worship you, a true and living
[19:01] God. We ask, Lord, that you will speak
[19:04] deeply to us. Move us, Lord, into those
[19:07] realms our soul so long and thirst for.
[19:11] Lord, we don't want a form of godliness,
[19:13] Lord. We want the power of God ever
[19:16] living within us. So we say, anoint the
[19:19] man of God. Anoint our ears to hear. Let
[19:23] the power of that word become fabric
[19:26] within our souls. And Father, these
[19:28] needs that Brother Rod has mentioned.
[19:30] And I'm sure there's many needs in here
[19:33] this morning. So by faith, we reach out
[19:36] to you. We say, "Lord, here am I. Lord,
[19:40] deliver me. Save me, heal me. Let the
[19:46] power of God do its eternal work within
[19:50] me. Lord, these those that are bound by
[19:53] spirits of depression, oppression. Lord,
[19:57] many of us were bound, but one day that
[19:59] resurrection came by our way and it
[20:02] loosed us. And we say, Lord, loose them
[20:04] this morning. Let your power of
[20:08] deliverance be their portion. We ask.
[20:11] And so, Father, as we continue to
[20:13] worship, be pleased to dwell amongst us,
[20:17] and we'll be sure to give you all glory,
[20:19] all honor, and praise in Jesus' name.
[20:23] Amen.
[20:27] Amen. You may be seated this morning.
[20:34] We want to welcome all those who are
[20:36] visiting with us. We're just real happy
[20:37] to have each and every one of you here
[20:38] this morning and trust that you'll enjoy
[20:41] the presence of God with us here this
[20:42] morning. We just love to worship. Amen.
[20:45] And I think there's a that's why we're
[20:47] here this morning. We want to come into
[20:49] God's presence and then we want to hear
[20:51] what he has to say to us. Amen. I want
[20:53] to bring greetings from the saints in
[20:55] Calgary. Uh Cindy and I and Anna had the
[20:59] privilege of being with them last uh
[21:01] Sunday. We're over uh celebrating the

[35:42] having a service. So, we're happy God's
[35:44] people are here.

[36:08] Uh this coming Wednesday uh brother
[36:11] Garrett Rudwald from Bezesburg, Germany
[36:16] is going to be here. His wife is uh
[36:18] coming with him also.
[36:20] Um also three other sisters are
[36:23] accompanying them on this journey. And
[36:26] uh I understood originally uh brother
[36:30] Gur uh Rotoald was coming to actually
[36:34] have the dedication service for the
[36:37] church in uh Ottawa where motherh
[36:41] brother brother Mubundo is the pastor
[36:44] but u he will I understand that the
[36:47] church is not finished not completed yet
[36:50] so that has been put off but he's he
[36:53] decided to make this trip anyway
[36:56] and uh brother Rudol will be in Edmonton
[36:59] uh today and then uh journeying on down
[37:02] here. So our Wednesday service be really
[37:07] nice to have our brother Rodald once
[37:08] again. I think the last time I was with
[37:11] him was in the meetings in the Ukraine
[37:14] when the church was dedicated there in
[37:17] Daetsk and uh he's been because they're
[37:21] in close proximity geographically to the
[37:25] Ukraine much closer than we are. I was
[37:28] really happy and encouraging also he and
[37:32] brother Schumacher another pastor to to
[37:36] remain close to the work in the Ukraine
[37:39] and uh I think they in fact is if I
[37:43] remember correctly they purchased the
[37:45] seats uh for the church there and uh I
[37:50] believe one of the churches bought a car
[37:53] for or kind of a van for for brother
[37:56] Vladimir here. And so we're really happy
[37:59] that they have a a burden to reach out
[38:02] and uh so you be not only praying for
[38:06] the meeting, but uh you come and you're
[38:09] going to be blessed and brother brother
[38:12] Rodal's ministry.
[38:14] Uh tonight, brother Tony is going to be
[38:17] having the service and he's been
[38:20] preparing uh since he returned from
[38:22] China and we have not had an opportunity
[38:25] to speak. he and myself. And so I'm as
[38:28] anxious or more so perhaps than anybody.
[38:32] I want to hear about the work in China,
[38:36] that great nation
[38:39] that is certainly rising to be dominant
[38:42] in the world of economics,
[38:45] in the world of productivity
[38:48] and uh in the world also politically.
[38:51] So they they're taking a very important
[38:54] part and I do not believe for a moment
[38:57] that it's an accident that the spirit of
[39:00] God is uh breathing and brooding in that
[39:04] great nation and that the gospel of this
[39:07] message which for so many years there
[39:10] seemed to be no door opened and then God
[39:13] in simplicity and you'll be hearing more
[39:16] about that term as we go through the
[39:19] service today but God works in very very
[39:22] simple ways and does marvelous marvelous
[39:26] things. And uh the Bible is is replete
[39:30] with examples of how the gospel started
[39:33] and and who went where and who was a
[39:36] test who was a testimony of the work of
[39:40] God in the various places. And look at
[39:43] Apostle Paul. He made we make so many
[39:47] references to three of his missionary
[39:49] journeys. But I tell you what, it wasn't
[39:52] a holiday. It wasn't a vacation. It
[39:54] wasn't a rest, but he made missionary
[39:57] journeys and he took some other young
[40:00] men with him. And the gospel was spread
[40:03] over that part of the earth. He wrote
[40:05] many, many letters. People reproduced
[40:08] those letters under conditions much more
[40:12] different than we have today. But they
[40:14] got those letters out and they got them
[40:17] to the needy people. And today, of
[40:19] course, what started out very very small
[40:21] is a great it's a great flood of the
[40:25] gospel in in uh throughout the world.
[40:28] So, we're going to be here this evening
[40:30] 5:00.
[40:32] Uh I don't know how many of you have
[40:35] been following uh Sister Rebecca Smith's
[40:38] condition, brother George Smith's wife
[40:42] uh and brother Brandham's daughter, but
[40:45] uh from what we have read and the
[40:47] contact we've had, she's certainly uh in
[40:50] need of our prayers. She's in serious
[40:52] condition. And I would like today as we
[40:56] are preparing for the word, I want to be
[40:59] in prayer for her. I believe it would be
[41:02] very fitting for us to
[41:05] uh seriously and sincerely
[41:09] uh bear our sister Rebecca up in prayer.
[41:12] And for those of you that have been here
[41:14] in this church for over a long period of
[41:17] years, uh sister Rebecca and brother
[41:20] George and their family were here for
[41:23] over two years, I believe about two and
[41:25] a half years. And so we just want to
[41:28] really bear her up in prayer at this
[41:30] time. I'd like to have you. We're going
[41:33] to read the scripture. So if you don't
[41:34] mind standing once again and I'd like to
[41:37] sing Sheltered in the Arms of God. Just
[41:39] the chorus, please. I'm sheltered in the
[41:42] arms of God. I've been singing this over
[41:44] and over during the days we've been
[41:47] away. And God uh God gave the brothers
[41:52] uh that were uh hunting along with
[41:56] myself and gave them real success and
[42:00] came home with uh several moose and
[42:03] we're real happy that God uh provided us
[42:07] with that uh opportunity to get away and
[42:11] to be alone also. I that's what I look
[42:13] forward to being alone. And so when I
[42:16] was alone I would be singing this song.
[42:18] I'm sheltered in the arms of God. Let
[42:21] the winds blow.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Let the trials come.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; You ready?
[42:29] &gt;&gt; I'm sheltered in the arms of God. How
[42:31] many sheltered?
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:34] All right.
[42:38] Let the stor
[42:45] [Music]
[42:54] with me.
[43:00] He was with me.
[43:06] on earth can I be
[43:12] for I
[43:22] Oh,
[43:24] [Music]
[43:27] I
[43:34] for
[43:37] [Music]
[43:47] [Music]
[43:52] Oh, bless your name Lord for
[44:00] the arms of God.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, you have provided
[44:10] a hiding place
[44:12] and we are held in the palm of your
[44:15] hand.
[44:16] We have no fear of what the world can do
[44:21] or what any enemy can do because we are
[44:25] held in the arms undergurtded by the
[44:29] almighty divine God. The only true and
[44:32] living God who sent forth Jesus Christ
[44:36] as a propitiation, as a sacrifice, as
[44:40] our substitute, and we stand here today
[44:44] free. Hallelujah. We stand here today
[44:47] purchased. We stand here today fully
[44:50] paid for. We stand here today, oh God,
[44:53] and the and the enemy, Satan has no
[44:56] mortgage on our life any longer. For
[44:58] when you said, Lord Jesus, it is
[45:00] finished. It was done. And you even went
[45:03] and preached to the souls that were in
[45:05] prison. You declared that the price had
[45:08] been paid. You stripped the enemy of the
[45:11] keys of death, hell, and the grave. And
[45:13] today, Lord, we face eternity with a
[45:16] glorious promise,
[45:18] with a great expectation. Today, Father,
[45:22] as we've gathered, we need your Holy
[45:24] Spirit. We need the spirit of revelation
[45:27] upon your word, upon our minds, upon our
[45:31] souls. Oh God, let this group of people
[45:34] that are visible and those that are on
[45:37] the internet, may we together rise on
[45:40] eagle's wings. May we rise into heavenly
[45:44] places in Christ Jesus. May we see
[45:46] things we have not hitherto seen. May we
[45:50] be, oh God, fed, I pray, upon your word.
[45:54] I give myself, Lord, to you as I stand
[45:56] here at the post of duty and this
[45:58] precious congregation of people who've
[46:00] come into expectation. You will not deny
[46:04] them and you will not send them away
[46:06] disappointed in Jesus Christ's name.
[46:09] Amen. Amen. God bless you. I'll be happy
[46:13] if you would join me by turning in your
[46:15] Bibles to Revelation the 6th chapter
[46:20] and we're going to start reading at the
[46:21] first verse.
[46:23] And I would like to say if you would
[46:26] please take seriously and sincerely
[46:30] uh the uh services. I've spoken two
[46:33] services on the seals and I am
[46:36] continuing on. I know that for a lot of
[46:39] people in the message that's very like a
[46:42] complicated and a complex, but I think
[46:45] that as we kind of move just slowly in
[46:49] it, it will break it down for you. So
[46:51] that I'm saying that to make this point
[46:54] that if you miss one of those services,
[46:57] you should be sure and pick it up on the
[46:59] archive and hear it because they do tie
[47:03] together and it will mean so much more
[47:06] to you if you understand what has been
[47:09] spoken and then you can continue on uh
[47:12] as we move forward in the in the seals.
[47:15] Um so we're going to read now starting
[47:19] with the first verse. We'll just read
[47:21] four verses.
[47:24] And I saw when the Lamb opened one of
[47:26] the seals, and I heard as it were the
[47:29] noise of thunder, one of the four beasts
[47:32] saying, "Come and see." And I saw, and
[47:36] behold, a white horse, and he that sat
[47:40] on him had a bow, and a crown was given
[47:43] unto him, and he went forth conquering
[47:46] and to conquer. And when he had opened
[47:49] the second seal, I heard the second
[47:52] beast say, "Come and see." And there
[47:56] went out another horse that was red. And
[47:59] power was given to him that sat thereon
[48:03] to take peace from the earth, and that
[48:06] they should kill one another. And there
[48:09] was given unto him a great sword. Amen.
[48:13] You may be seated.
[48:18] I'm taking a phrase out of these verses,
[48:22] conquering and to conquer as a uh title
[48:27] to the service today. Conquering and to
[48:29] conquer.
[48:31] The opening of the seals
[48:35] uh is to us the opening and the
[48:40] revealing of things that at at least it
[48:43] should be revealing of things that have
[48:46] hitherto been hidden or it may reveal
[48:50] something that we have seen happen but
[48:53] we can't really identify it in the
[48:55] scripture. Uh it may be something we may
[48:59] just class it as a world event. example.
[49:03] It's no mystery to anybody here, even
[49:04] the youngest, that we've gone through
[49:06] two world wars. We've had the first
[49:09] world war. We've had the second world
[49:10] war. But it only took a prophet to say
[49:13] there was a birth pain. It was a birth
[49:16] pain. So spiritually it was a birth
[49:18] pain, a actual spiritual birth pain on
[49:22] the earth. See, so there are things that
[49:24] we've experienced, we have knowledge
[49:27] about, but we perhaps can't tie it
[49:30] together in the scripture. That's number
[49:33] one. Number two, the scripture can be
[49:38] say in a very few words something that
[49:41] actually covers
[49:43] uh centuries of time.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Just a few words. But when those words
[49:50] are examined, when that sentence is
[49:52] examined, then you'll find that it
[49:55] actually not only covers a great span of
[49:58] time, but reveals to you what was
[50:00] happening during that time. And you'll
[50:03] find it sewn all through the scripture.
[50:05] It will be scripturally based and
[50:08] founded with with a with a real solid
[50:12] scriptural background.
[50:15] And so now the opening of the seals
[50:18] provides us with an interpretation
[50:21] by the opening when brother Brandon
[50:23] spoke this opening of the seals it
[50:25] provides us with an interpretation
[50:28] of the what apostle John saw said I saw
[50:33] and then he describes what he saw. Now
[50:37] in this first verse, he said, "And I saw
[50:40] when the lamb opened one of the seals,
[50:43] and I heard as it were a noise of
[50:45] thunder, and one of the four beasts
[50:48] saying, come and see." Now, these four
[50:50] beasts, uh, I need to background this a
[50:53] wee bit, but so that you have, uh, you
[50:57] have a kind of a a mental picture. So,
[51:01] one of the four beasts, there were four
[51:02] beasts in chapter 5 of Revelation when
[51:06] there was no one found worthy to open
[51:08] the book. The Bible says that the angel
[51:13] said to John, "Weep not, for the lion of
[51:16] the tribe of Judah hath prevailed to
[51:18] open the book." He turns to see the lion
[51:21] and he says he sees a lamb in the in the
[51:24] midst lamb in the midst and four beasts
[51:29] which in the book of revelation there's
[51:33] two Greek words for the beast and one is
[51:36] an untame an unt unameable creature and
[51:40] the other the other is a a it's a living
[51:44] creature. They're completely completely
[51:47] different. And so you have to see now.
[51:49] So here what we have here in this
[51:51] opening of the seals, we have four horse
[51:55] riders and we have four living
[51:58] creatures. And the four horse riders
[52:01] essentially are they are the evil power
[52:06] that is sent into the earth. And we'll
[52:08] describe that. And the four living
[52:11] creatures which were surrounding the
[52:13] lamb at the throne of God are also four
[52:19] powers. And when the evil power rode out
[52:22] into the earth, spread out into the
[52:24] earth at various times through the last
[52:27] 2,000 years, God sent an anointing
[52:30] power. He sent a power upon the elect,
[52:34] the believers of that age that could
[52:37] combat this power that was sent on the
[52:39] earth.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; And so that is the picture which we need
[52:43] to see. And so uh Apostle John,
[52:47] he sees this uh horse rider come out and
[52:51] I'd like to just give a brief
[52:54] description. He says the lamb opened the
[52:57] seal. So the lamb we know as Christ and
[53:02] the sound of thunder is is is clearly
[53:06] the voice of God speaking. So there's a
[53:10] voice of God that comes at that time.
[53:12] And the four beasts or the four living
[53:15] creatures represents the anointing power
[53:18] which I've just said I'm repeating now
[53:20] that God sent into his elect of that age
[53:25] to combat the power of Satan that had
[53:28] been released at that age. I I think
[53:31] that you'll all agree we live in a very
[53:33] different society today than people even
[53:36] just aund years ago. In fact, his
[53:39] society uh and civilization carried on
[53:43] for even hundreds and thousands of years
[53:47] for very little change. I've been to
[53:50] countries where they're plowing with a
[53:52] stick.
[53:54] Over here, they have just incredibly
[53:58] uh huge equipment and they're they're
[54:02] plowing the land and uh fertilizing the
[54:06] land and doing all kinds of things. and
[54:07] you just go on an 8-hour jet flight and
[54:10] you land in some country and they're
[54:12] holding a stick behind an ax and turning
[54:15] over a little bit of soil. It doesn't
[54:17] sound it doesn't look like you're in the
[54:19] same world.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; And they've been doing that for
[54:21] centuries and centuries and centuries
[54:23] and centuries and they're not
[54:25] unintelligent people. They're not
[54:26] ignorant people. They things just have
[54:28] not changed. But for us it has changed
[54:31] and for much of the world it has
[54:32] changed. And so uh we have to see that
[54:37] that uh even spiritually speaking there
[54:40] have been uh times and eras there has
[54:44] been seasons when sin has been perhaps
[54:48] more rampant or Satan has used a
[54:51] different tactic in his approach to
[54:55] bring humanity under his domain under
[54:59] his dominion. So now I'm just I'm giving
[55:02] just a a a background here. So we have
[55:05] the four living creatures, four beasts
[55:08] the scripture calls it. And we have the
[55:10] four horse riders which is actually the
[55:14] power of antichrist that Satan worked
[55:17] through in each age. Now in the messages
[55:21] I'm just going to make reference. We
[55:23] have the white horse, the red horse, the
[55:24] black horse, and the pale horse. Brother
[55:27] Brandham says concerning the white
[55:28] horse, "This is the Satan's superman
[55:34] with education, with wisdom, with church
[55:37] theology of his own word, his own
[55:41] making, and he rides his white
[55:44] denominational horse to deceive the
[55:47] people, and he will conquer every
[55:49] religion of the world."
[55:51] Now in that statement he is showing what
[55:55] it is
[55:56] &gt;&gt; and also link tying it to a prophecy. It
[55:59] will conquer every religion of the
[56:02] world.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; The red horse in the third seal he says
[56:08] then he jumps off his white horse. The
[56:11] white horse rides on out. Now he
[56:14] straddles what? A red horse. Blood.
[56:18] Blood red horse. He really rides that
[56:22] one. He said now he's given a great
[56:26] power and a great sword to kill. Then he
[56:30] rides his red blood red horse and that's
[56:33] the age of the martyrs.
[56:36] Then a black horse. Now here he is on
[56:40] his black horse now coming forth the
[56:44] dark age.
[56:47] That was that time, just about the time
[56:50] after the church got set up and got in
[56:53] power. They smothered out everything
[56:55] else and went through hundreds and
[56:58] hundreds and hundreds of years is what
[57:02] every reader knows that was the dark
[57:04] ages. And how many know that? Sure. He
[57:07] said the dark ages that's your dark
[57:10] horse representing the dark age. So then
[57:13] Satan when he could not by cruelty and
[57:17] on that red horsepower when he could not
[57:21] quench and put out and extinguish the
[57:24] light of the gospel and the power
[57:27] because God each time sent out his
[57:29] anointing of the living creature upon
[57:32] the elect of that age and when he could
[57:35] not do it by martyr is uh m through the
[57:38] martyr martyring of the people they we
[57:41] always say 68 million But people have
[57:43] been slain. That was just that era at
[57:46] that time. And it's recorded 68 million
[57:49] were slaying. Can you imagine riding the
[57:53] power of the red horse but could not
[57:55] extinguish the flame of the gospel
[57:58] because God the prophet said what what
[58:01] could they do? H how could they do
[58:03] anything else but run into it? And
[58:05] that's why they freely gave their lives.
[58:09] And when people when that power is
[58:11] trying to extinguish that antichrist
[58:13] power said if you don't deny if you
[58:16] don't deny your faith we're going to
[58:18] take your life. They said take it take
[58:21] it. They couldn't give it fast enough
[58:23] because they were anointed to do that.
[58:27] Think of that. Isn't it marvelous that
[58:28] God always sent a power that Satan was
[58:31] never able to quench the flame of the
[58:35] gospel of Jesus Christ because they
[58:38] freely gave their lives.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:43] And God's got a power on this age as
[58:45] well.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; You got to know that we're not here
[58:48] powerless. We haven't run out of gas. We
[58:51] haven't run out of energy. Amen.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; We're empowered
[58:55] &gt;&gt; by the same spirit and whatever tactic
[58:58] Satan may use, there's more than
[59:01] adequate power and the church will
[59:03] prevail.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; And so this black horse then then he ta
[59:10] came into political powers into a
[59:12] political realm and outlawed the gospel
[59:16] outlawed it and we came into dark ages.
[59:19] But even during that time, hundreds of
[59:22] years of dark ages that Satan was not
[59:25] able even through all his political and
[59:28] religious power, he was not able once
[59:31] again to extinguish the truth of the
[59:34] gospel of Jesus Christ because people
[59:36] were uh they were able to go to they
[59:40] were willing to go to any degree that
[59:43] was required of them to live true to the
[59:46] gospel of Jesus Christ. And so that was
[59:49] the black horse. Now the pale horse,
[59:51] which brother Brandham describes in the
[59:53] fourth seal, he said, notice the
[59:56] antichrist was on a pale horse, a mixed
[1:00:00] color. Really, the pale horse is the
[1:00:02] white, the red, and the black. All of
[1:00:05] those powers combined
[1:00:09] and making a pale horse. Whereas also,
[1:00:14] and that's why it's the most deceptive
[1:00:17] of all ages, that's why Jesus said that
[1:00:21] that he would deceive the very elect if
[1:00:24] it were possible. But it's not possible.
[1:00:27] But it would be such a deceptive age.
[1:00:30] And you people are living, we are living
[1:00:34] in the most deceptive of all ages.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Because all the combination of the white
[1:00:41] horse, everything, all the deception of
[1:00:43] the white, all the cruelty of the red
[1:00:47] and all the darkness of the black are
[1:00:50] combined together into this one power at
[1:00:55] the end time. I can tell you we have a
[1:00:58] leodyian age where everybody has their
[1:01:00] rights but don't ever forget there's a
[1:01:03] very cruel aspect and and we don't have
[1:01:07] maybe out uh out in the forefront the
[1:01:11] cruelty is denied or will take your head
[1:01:14] off or take your life or whatever more
[1:01:16] but it's working through the uh I will
[1:01:20] say the political powers to try to bring
[1:01:24] forth uh laws bring forth uh regulations
[1:01:29] and bring forth things in a in a
[1:01:32] political realm that that bring great
[1:01:34] great pressure on the people. Well, we
[1:01:37] have it. We have it. You have it on a on
[1:01:40] a daily basis and but you're not as
[1:01:43] aware of it because it's working in such
[1:01:45] a de devious cunning way. Amen.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; We have it. I can't even describe it and
[1:01:54] I don't even like to get on it.
[1:01:56] But we have it right here, right in this
[1:02:00] city of Suriri at this moment where two
[1:02:03] women who are lesbians have succeeded in
[1:02:08] getting uh a court of law and a judge to
[1:02:14] pass legislation
[1:02:16] that that and they're trying to they're
[1:02:20] trying to bring it down right now as I'm
[1:02:21] standing here trying to bring it down
[1:02:24] into our educational system that it must
[1:02:28] be taught uh the the children of this
[1:02:31] city must be taught uh uh this kind of
[1:02:35] uh a sexual orientation
[1:02:38] and further for the first time they're
[1:02:40] trying to get passage that you as
[1:02:43] parents will not be permitted to take
[1:02:45] your children out of that class. Well, I
[1:02:48] can tell you what they could put me to
[1:02:50] jail for the rest of my life as long as
[1:02:53] they want. My children would never be
[1:02:55] subjected to that fact.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Never. And I say to you over the pulpit,
[1:03:00] I wouldn't care if they came in and
[1:03:01] arrested me at this moment. I say to you
[1:03:04] over the pulpit to you people, never let
[1:03:06] your children be subjected to that kind
[1:03:08] of thing.
[1:03:10] And that's the kind of thing that that's
[1:03:12] where he's working working in that kind
[1:03:15] of thing. It's in the it's in the
[1:03:17] newspapers. I don't subscribe to any
[1:03:19] newspaper, but they get delivered to my
[1:03:21] door. And that thing makes me uh
[1:03:24] spiritually ill
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; to think that people and there's a lot
[1:03:29] of innocent people, a lot of good
[1:03:32] churchgoing people who are going to be
[1:03:34] subjected to that and they're going to
[1:03:37] count to it. They're going to bend to it
[1:03:40] because it because it's simply coming
[1:03:42] through that kind of a channel. Now, to
[1:03:44] me, that is cruel.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; It's dark.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; And it's deceptive.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; It's everything that's described in
[1:03:54] those three three horse riders.
[1:03:58] Don't get me onto that or we won't get
[1:04:00] past where we want to go this morning.
[1:04:03] Said he rides on a pale horse. And I'm
[1:04:07] giving you this quote so that because
[1:04:08] there's perhaps some confusion when that
[1:04:10] is happening. said rides on a pale horse
[1:04:13] as he appears on his ride. This last
[1:04:16] ride he's on this uh last now now he
[1:04:21] said that is not in our day.
[1:04:25] See I could I could possibly believe
[1:04:27] that it was because I feel that it is
[1:04:30] but he says that is not in our day. That
[1:04:32] will be on down. It's the seal foretold.
[1:04:36] The church has done gone up when this
[1:04:39] happens. So when the full force of all
[1:04:42] of the Antichrist power that will be in
[1:04:45] a tribulation period and we thank God
[1:04:47] for this prophecy, the church will be
[1:04:49] gone.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; The bride will be gone.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We'll be done with this
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; old world.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; I say you can have it.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Take this old world. Give me Jesus.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:07] So a different color horse depicting the
[1:05:09] tactics used by Satan at certain times.
[1:05:13] Now I have a lot to quote. You don't
[1:05:14] mind that? Because the service today has
[1:05:19] both a negative and a positive aspect to
[1:05:24] conquering and to conquer. And
[1:05:26] unfortunately I probably won't get
[1:05:28] beyond the negative aspect. So remember
[1:05:31] people, you can say amen when it's
[1:05:33] negative, but it doesn't apply to you.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; In the fifth seal, he said, "Now you see
[1:05:42] the four beasts rode, and now each age,
[1:05:46] here's each age or each power that rode
[1:05:50] behind it." Here's each age and each
[1:05:53] power that rode behind it.
[1:05:56] the I'm just giving some quotes now for
[1:05:58] for statements that I've just made. He
[1:06:01] said, "And here's the scripture that
[1:06:03] shows
[1:06:05] what the enemy's rider did." So, we have
[1:06:08] the enemy's writer that's been revealed
[1:06:11] in these seals. And also it's been
[1:06:13] revealed now that each beast power that
[1:06:18] God sent out to combat it hits exactly
[1:06:23] on the dot up to the eagle time up to
[1:06:26] this age. So that each Satan would ride
[1:06:30] out and God would send a power upon his
[1:06:33] elect to combat that and they were
[1:06:36] victorious every time. Amen.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; And the seed shall not be heir with a
[1:06:41] shock. He said, "Now remember according
[1:06:44] to Revelation, the whole mystery of the
[1:06:47] book is sealed with seven seals that the
[1:06:50] reformers didn't have a chance to bring
[1:06:53] forth the four stages of reforming."
[1:06:56] Four stages. Four living creatures, four
[1:06:59] horse riders, four stages of reforming.
[1:07:01] He said the four stages of the beasts
[1:07:03] that went out to meet the four powers of
[1:07:06] the world. the four stages of the living
[1:07:09] creatures or the beasts as it's called
[1:07:12] in Revelation to ride out uh to meet the
[1:07:15] four powers of the world. He said what
[1:07:18] was the first that went out? He said a
[1:07:21] lion to meet the Roman age and that was
[1:07:25] the word the original. He's the lion of
[1:07:29] the tribe of Judah. Christ himself
[1:07:33] went to meet that age. Jesus said to the
[1:07:36] disciples, I will not leave you
[1:07:38] comfortless. I will come to you. And so
[1:07:42] he said, "It's expedient for you that I
[1:07:44] go away. If I don't go, the Holy Spirit
[1:07:46] can't come." Because that spirit of God
[1:07:49] was in him. He was the fullness of the
[1:07:51] Godhead bodily. And so he physically
[1:07:54] departed and the Holy Spirit, which was
[1:07:56] the very spirit of Christ, came down
[1:07:58] into the church. And the church was
[1:08:01] birthed at Pentecost. and and and the
[1:08:05] perfect word was given to the apostles
[1:08:08] and that was the power that went out to
[1:08:11] combat the Antichrist spirit.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; The white horse rider, the white horse
[1:08:18] rider went out. He said he's he's mighty
[1:08:21] in his conquering power. Is a great
[1:08:24] fellow in his conquering power. And you
[1:08:27] want to tell me who he is? He said he's
[1:08:28] the antichrist.
[1:08:30] Now anti Anti
[1:08:35] is in the room of
[1:08:39] instead of
[1:08:42] in the place of that's anti
[1:08:46] antichrist. And that's why you'll find
[1:08:48] brother Brennham saying in the message
[1:08:50] anti-
[1:08:52] Christ talking of the pope as the viker
[1:08:56] of Christ which is in the place of
[1:09:00] Christ. And so you see the seat that
[1:09:02] that Satan has established that he's
[1:09:05] going to use for that purpose.
[1:09:10] The first record we have
[1:09:15] of this anti-spirit
[1:09:17] is actually in heaven.
[1:09:22] Satan said it came into his heart or
[1:09:24] into his being. We do not understand the
[1:09:27] structure of angels as such. But the
[1:09:30] Bible says that iniquity was found in
[1:09:32] his heart.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; And a prophet comes in this day and you
[1:09:36] don't hear it anywhere else. But he says
[1:09:38] the first war was in heaven.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; And I have questions about that, but
[1:09:43] they will be answered sometime. I'm not
[1:09:45] going to be worried about it. I I I'm
[1:09:47] just curious to know how it started in
[1:09:49] such a perfect place as heaven. But the
[1:09:52] first war was in heaven. And the war was
[1:09:54] anti-word
[1:09:56] because Satan said in his heart, he said
[1:09:58] this, "I will ascend above the heights
[1:10:02] of the clouds and I will be like the
[1:10:06] most high." In other words, I will
[1:10:10] displace I will move out of my position.
[1:10:14] I will move into another position that's
[1:10:16] not been given me. I am anti-word.
[1:10:21] I've been created by God, but I am I am
[1:10:26] going to ascend to a position that was
[1:10:29] not given him.
[1:10:32] And that is the first example of anti-
[1:10:35] Christ, anti-word
[1:10:39] in the greatest battle he ever fought,
[1:10:41] ever fought. He says, he said this, this
[1:10:44] great first battle that was ever fought
[1:10:47] began in heaven when Michael and his
[1:10:50] angels fought against Lucifer and his
[1:10:53] angels. That was the first battle in
[1:10:56] heaven. Now, Satan appears in Eden. So,
[1:11:02] we move on. He appears in Eden
[1:11:06] at the and he approaches Eve with this
[1:11:10] word. Hath God said?
[1:11:14] And it's very very interesting
[1:11:17] because he comes with something
[1:11:22] a beginning that is so innocent.
[1:11:26] And if you want to look in the Bible for
[1:11:28] a question mark, that happens to be the
[1:11:31] first question mark in the Bible because
[1:11:34] it's the first question in the Bible.
[1:11:37] It's the first question in the history
[1:11:40] of what we have in the whole spiritual
[1:11:43] realm. And that was presented by Satan
[1:11:47] himself through the serpent.
[1:11:50] Asked the first question. There's a
[1:11:52] reason for asking a question because
[1:11:56] often
[1:11:58] you know Satan will come to you as an
[1:12:00] individual and in your own excuse me in
[1:12:03] your own uh in your own inner self
[1:12:07] you'll have question say you know do you
[1:12:10] really think you're a believer do you
[1:12:13] really think look at the errors you make
[1:12:14] look at the mistakes you make look at
[1:12:16] how weak you are look at how frail look
[1:12:19] at the failures that you've made. Who's
[1:12:22] that that's bringing that? It's not the
[1:12:24] Holy Spirit.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; It's not the Holy Spirit. Satan, he
[1:12:29] operates on question.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; You really think you're a member of the
[1:12:33] bride? You really think you're You
[1:12:35] really think you're saved? You really
[1:12:37] think you're going to heaven? You really
[1:12:39] think you're going? That's him.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; And he's asking that for a good reason.
[1:12:44] Because in asking a question, it tends
[1:12:48] to destabilize a person.
[1:12:52] It it it it raises a doubt in a person's
[1:12:54] mind.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Do you really think you really think the
[1:12:58] message is true? You really think it is
[1:13:00] what people have said it is? You really
[1:13:02] think that miracle? You really think
[1:13:04] that power? You really think that he can
[1:13:06] heal? You really think he can deliver?
[1:13:08] You really think you can be? That's him.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; And it destabilizes a person. when you
[1:13:15] even hear even within the realms of the
[1:13:18] of the message, you'll hear uh someone
[1:13:20] come and maybe say, "Uh, you you you
[1:13:23] really think you've got the revelation
[1:13:25] of the word? You really think that you
[1:13:27] have it there? You really think that
[1:13:28] your church has it? You really think
[1:13:30] they have the revelation of the word?"
[1:13:32] And it destabilizes a person because it
[1:13:34] raises a question, uh, well, don't we?
[1:13:38] Do we? And that's where they come in,
[1:13:41] slip in, say, "Ah, but I have something
[1:13:43] for you.
[1:13:45] I've got something special.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Now they've destabilized the person.
[1:13:50] I've got what you really need to
[1:13:52] stabilize. You
[1:13:57] notice I'm going to just walk you
[1:13:59] through this a wee bit.
[1:14:03] This is a little different for me. I'm
[1:14:04] not preaching so much.
[1:14:11] And the serpent was more subtle.
[1:14:15] than any beast of the field. There's a
[1:14:17] beast there. He's a wild one.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; This one can't be tamed.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Cain couldn't be tamed.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Ishmamail couldn't be tamed. Judas
[1:14:29] couldn't be tamed because they're all of
[1:14:31] the same race.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; And there's groups today can't be tamed.
[1:14:39] Won't receive the word of God. They're
[1:14:42] antagonistic against it. There's people
[1:14:44] who do want to even go say on one hand,
[1:14:46] "Oh, we love Jesus. We love Jesus. Would
[1:14:48] you like to be baptized in his name?
[1:14:50] What do you mean?" And forsake the
[1:14:52] Trinity.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Can't even find the word in the Bible.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; I can find the word Jesus in the Bible
[1:15:02] all through it. I can find where they
[1:15:04] baptized in his name in the Bible. But
[1:15:06] there's people become antagonistic
[1:15:08] immediately. Oh, I know that spirit.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; That's not the spirit of God.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Spirit of Christ loves that. Do all
[1:15:18] things in his name?
[1:15:22] So, he's more subtle than any beast of
[1:15:23] the field?
[1:15:25] And he said unto the woman,
[1:15:29] "Hath God said,
[1:15:32] you shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:15:34] garden?" First question.
[1:15:37] And the woman said unto the serpent, "We
[1:15:40] may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[1:15:42] garden, but of the fruit of the tree
[1:15:45] which is in the midst of the garden, God
[1:15:47] has said, you shall not eat of it,
[1:15:49] neither shall you touch it, lest you
[1:15:51] die." That's what God said. And the
[1:15:54] serpent said unto the woman, now he's
[1:15:57] taking a second step. The first one was
[1:15:58] a question. Now he comes with a
[1:16:01] statement. Ye shall not surely die. See
[1:16:05] how brazen that is? You see the pattern
[1:16:08] of it? Raise a question, destabilize
[1:16:12] the mind, and then come in with a
[1:16:14] statement, you shall not surely die.
[1:16:17] In other words, this isn't the way.
[1:16:19] That's not completely the truth. And
[1:16:22] that was the anti-word,
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; antirist,
[1:16:28] same spirit there. And uh and he said,
[1:16:32] "You shall not surely die." And now he
[1:16:34] goes on to say, "For God doth know that
[1:16:38] in the day you eat thereof, then your
[1:16:41] eyes will be opened,
[1:16:45] and you shall be as gods, knowing good
[1:16:48] and evil." In other words, you're going
[1:16:51] to attain to something. You're going to
[1:16:54] reach into a realm that you won't reach
[1:16:57] into if you remain here in this status.
[1:16:59] You've got to accept this my counsel, my
[1:17:03] word, which is anti-word, antichrist,
[1:17:06] anti- good. So now what what really is
[1:17:08] it? It is taking this instead of that
[1:17:14] instead of what God has said. So he's
[1:17:17] actually instead of anti-word.
[1:17:28] The reason I did that I I want to go
[1:17:30] back to the beginnings. You need to go
[1:17:33] back to beginnings to find out because
[1:17:36] some of the things that now brother
[1:17:37] Brandham has said about this opening of
[1:17:39] this seal is is so simple and remember
[1:17:44] it is in simplicity.
[1:17:46] And so he's if we go back to the
[1:17:49] beginnings. So he says, "And I saw
[1:17:52] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[1:17:55] the seals and I heard as it were the
[1:17:59] noise of thunder, a voice, and one of
[1:18:03] the four beasts saying, now he heard
[1:18:05] this, come and see.
[1:18:08] I I'm just I really want
[1:18:13] you to lay a hold and pinch your
[1:18:15] conscience
[1:18:17] be for what I'm going to say now.
[1:18:21] This first seal is two verses.
[1:18:25] And God has sealed
[1:18:28] has sealed up some incredible truth
[1:18:34] in two verses which you can read and
[1:18:37] people have read and theologians have
[1:18:38] read and I have read and all kinds of
[1:18:41] preachers have read for years and years
[1:18:44] and years and we don't really come up
[1:18:46] with a solution. a prophet comes and he
[1:18:48] and he deals with it and even when you
[1:18:50] read it in the in the message and hear
[1:18:53] the prophet speak about it unless God
[1:18:56] will somehow give us an entrance we pass
[1:19:00] over it
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; and don't really grasp what it is and so
[1:19:05] I was I've been really pondering these
[1:19:08] things
[1:19:10] and my statement to you is this and I
[1:19:13] saw and behold a white horse and he that
[1:19:15] sat on him had a bow and a crown was
[1:19:17] given on him and he went forth
[1:19:19] conquering and to conquer and that's the
[1:19:21] end of it.
[1:19:23] What
[1:19:26] in all of the realm of spiritual
[1:19:29] thought, what can be locked up in there
[1:19:32] that was so
[1:19:35] incredibly important that God would keep
[1:19:38] that sealed, some truth sealed in these
[1:19:43] few lines for all these centuries of
[1:19:46] time.
[1:19:49] What is it?
[1:19:54] for centuries of time.
[1:19:58] Now I get into the message.
[1:20:02] I'm going to move through it now just
[1:20:06] that I have your attention.
[1:20:10] He says that this white horse rider this
[1:20:13] power
[1:20:15] he has a bow.
[1:20:17] Prophet says quickly no arrows.
[1:20:21] He's a bluff.
[1:20:23] That's number one.
[1:20:26] He's a a and a crown was given unto him.
[1:20:32] He didn't he didn't, shall I say,
[1:20:37] correctly inherit that crown, but it's
[1:20:40] given to him,
[1:20:42] and he went forth conquering and to
[1:20:45] conquer. Yet there's no indication
[1:20:50] as to how he conquers or what it is that
[1:20:54] he conquers. There's no indication of
[1:20:57] that.
[1:21:00] What method will he use to do this? We
[1:21:04] know and I don't think it's a great
[1:21:06] mystery to a lot of people that this is
[1:21:09] some power that is rolled out into the
[1:21:11] world and he's given uh he's given a
[1:21:14] bow. And I've read where other men have
[1:21:15] said and they've noticed he has no
[1:21:17] arrows. He has no arrows. It's not only
[1:21:19] brother Brandham that has seen that.
[1:21:21] They see it. Men who thinks of it, they
[1:21:23] look at it and say, "He has no arrows,
[1:21:25] but he's got a bow and he's riding out."
[1:21:28] But who is he? And what method does he
[1:21:30] use? And what is he to do? And some say
[1:21:32] he's Antichrist. But that's where they
[1:21:34] end. They don't they don't uh they're
[1:21:36] not able to uncover.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; And that's what a prophet is all about.
[1:21:41] to pull the veil off and uncover how
[1:21:44] he's doing it and show his deception so
[1:21:47] that we do not have to be ignorant. And
[1:21:50] it should be very very clear to us when
[1:21:52] it's all done. And that's my purpose of
[1:21:55] simply taking what a prophet has said.
[1:21:58] He says, "And now in the second seal,
[1:22:00] he's going back and just reviewing this
[1:22:02] first one, picking it up a wee bit." He
[1:22:04] says, "And when he started,
[1:22:07] well, he's just a little doctrine. When
[1:22:09] he starts,
[1:22:11] this is what he is, the Antichrist."
[1:22:13] That's that's exactly what he came to
[1:22:16] Eve when he said, "Hath God said?"
[1:22:20] So, opens up her mind. A question.
[1:22:25] You got to be very careful about
[1:22:26] questions.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; You got to make sure it's God asking a
[1:22:30] question.
[1:22:34] And then when he got a response from
[1:22:36] her, then he came with a doctrine. And
[1:22:40] the doctrine was you won't really die.
[1:22:44] In fact is
[1:22:46] you're going to you're going to rise to
[1:22:49] heights that you couldn't get if you
[1:22:51] don't accept this.
[1:22:54] Now he's coming with his doctrine.
[1:22:56] So he said he came first with a doctrine
[1:23:00] in amongst he said called nicicoleinism.
[1:23:04] Now for all you young people and
[1:23:06] everyone here that doesn't understand
[1:23:08] nicolotinism
[1:23:10] nickel is is to to overpower or to take
[1:23:15] under control. Nicolotinism
[1:23:18] is to conquer the leoty.
[1:23:22] The people
[1:23:23] something to conquer the people. That's
[1:23:27] going to be surprise to you. It was a
[1:23:29] surprise to me.
[1:23:32] That is his intent to conquer the
[1:23:37] people. Nickelanism. So how is he going
[1:23:41] to do this? Now there's the question.
[1:23:44] And he says,
[1:23:46] "Of course, it wouldn't it wouldn't slay
[1:23:49] anything." See, in this first white
[1:23:52] horse rider, it wouldn't slay anything.
[1:23:54] He said, "That's Revelation 2 and 6. If
[1:23:56] you want to put it down, he wouldn't
[1:23:58] slay anything. It's just a doctrine."
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:24:04] the serpent said nothing to Eve. I'm
[1:24:06] showing way back there, there was
[1:24:08] Antichrist spirit. He didn't say
[1:24:10] anything to Eve about you're going to
[1:24:12] die. He says, "You're you're not going
[1:24:13] to die.
[1:24:17] It's just a doctrine, just a spirit
[1:24:20] amongst the people." Now, he said he
[1:24:22] wouldn't slay anything. Oh, he's just so
[1:24:25] innocent. And I want you to hold on to
[1:24:28] that word. He's just so innocent.
[1:24:32] You know, there's a lot of innocent
[1:24:33] things, and I hope to maybe'll be able
[1:24:35] to touch on some. There's a lot of
[1:24:37] innocent things that we engage in
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; in this world that except for the grace
[1:24:45] of God, they're very dangerous.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; It's just so innocent. It comes in so
[1:24:51] innocent.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; And I want that this congregation and
[1:24:55] all who listen to me this morning really
[1:24:59] lay hold of some of these things that we
[1:25:01] treat innocently, but they're very
[1:25:04] dangerous.
[1:25:06] Amen.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; He said he was so innocent riding in
[1:25:11] riding on his white horse.
[1:25:14] He says, "Well, you know, you can have a
[1:25:17] great worldwide church. We could call it
[1:25:20] the universal church." They still do.
[1:25:24] And oh, it's so perfectly innocent.
[1:25:27] It's so innocent. It's just a group of
[1:25:30] men and we've come together for
[1:25:32] fellowship. very innocent, very white, a
[1:25:37] white horse. So now he's got a group of
[1:25:39] people coming together. They're coming
[1:25:42] together for fellowship or whatever
[1:25:43] more. It's so innocent. He says,
[1:25:46] secondly, the second thought that must
[1:25:49] be impressed on our hearts is that the
[1:25:52] seven church ages started out with
[1:25:56] started out with the Antichrist spirit
[1:26:00] as well as the Holy Spirit. And so now
[1:26:02] we've gone from heaven where there was
[1:26:04] an anti-word to Eden where there's an
[1:26:07] anti-word. And now we've come right up
[1:26:09] to the New Testament church being
[1:26:11] birthed and the prophets saying now
[1:26:14] there is both the both the Holy Spirit
[1:26:18] and antichrist spirit. Let me give you
[1:26:20] the scripture for it. Here's the
[1:26:22] scriptures.
[1:26:24] 1 John 2:18. Little children, it is the
[1:26:28] last time and as ye have heard that
[1:26:31] antichrist shall come even now are there
[1:26:35] many antichrist whereby we know it is
[1:26:38] the last time. So already the apostle
[1:26:41] John is saying it's already here
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; and the prophet comes in this day says
[1:26:46] it was there at that time when he
[1:26:48] describes it and ties it together with
[1:26:50] the white horse in revelation saying he
[1:26:53] was so innocent just looked so uh
[1:26:57] unthreatening.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; It's it's so innocent and that's what
[1:27:01] surprises and takes people. Now John
[1:27:04] also said the apostle John 1 John 4:3
[1:27:08] and every spirit that confessth not that
[1:27:10] Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not
[1:27:14] of God and this is that spirit of
[1:27:17] antichrist
[1:27:19] whereof you have heard that it should
[1:27:21] come and even now already is in the
[1:27:26] world.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; So now that's exactly what brother
[1:27:29] Brandham is referring to.
[1:27:32] So, like it was with Eve,
[1:27:36] Satan appealed to her reasoning
[1:27:39] and that part of the human psyche. I
[1:27:43] want you now to listen very close as it
[1:27:46] was with Eve and and that part of the
[1:27:49] human psyche that
[1:27:53] he appealed to and that is that
[1:27:57] people
[1:27:59] all of us
[1:28:01] are at at some have some uh
[1:28:06] part of the our human makeup that we are
[1:28:09] impressed with greatness.
[1:28:12] We could say great skill,
[1:28:15] great abilities,
[1:28:18] great wealth,
[1:28:20] great intelligence,
[1:28:22] great whatever, greatly gifted, an
[1:28:27] orator,
[1:28:28] an author, a writer, an actor, a sports
[1:28:35] uh person, someone who's who's highly
[1:28:40] accomplished.
[1:28:41] There's something that impresses us.
[1:28:46] You're nice and quiet. But that happens
[1:28:49] to be the case.
[1:28:52] Some are impressed with great strength.
[1:28:55] Some are impressed with great beauty.
[1:28:58] How lovely that is. How beautiful this
[1:29:01] person is. How handsome they are. How
[1:29:05] skilled they are. Oh, I wish I had their
[1:29:09] mental powers. I wish I could I I wish I
[1:29:13] uh uh I just wish I had their their
[1:29:16] gift. Oh, the great greatness of music
[1:29:21] or musicians or whatever it might be.
[1:29:25] And soon as a person uh becomes known
[1:29:29] that uh they are they are of a certain
[1:29:34] status
[1:29:36] uh
[1:29:37] immediately there's a level of respect
[1:29:40] that is given to that and I want to be
[1:29:42] quick to say I don't believe that should
[1:29:44] be degraded or taken away from that
[1:29:48] person but it has to be held within
[1:29:50] certain parameters or it becomes very
[1:29:53] dangerous.
[1:29:55] those skills, those talents, those gifts
[1:29:57] and so on are given to a person by God
[1:30:00] Almighty himself has been given. But
[1:30:02] that's what Satan appeals to.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; And so now I'm breaking into the main
[1:30:08] part of the message. Are you following
[1:30:10] me thus far?
[1:30:21] What is perceived? And we're all very
[1:30:23] very different on this subject.
[1:30:26] What is perceived as as greatness? As
[1:30:29] different as we all are,
[1:30:31] there are some that are impressed with
[1:30:33] one thing. Next person sitting right
[1:30:34] beside him said, "That doesn't impress
[1:30:36] me a bit."
[1:30:38] Some person looks at some piece of art
[1:30:39] and they said, "Oh my, this is so
[1:30:42] incredible." I said, "They ought to take
[1:30:44] it off the wall, burn it, as far as I'm
[1:30:46] concerned."
[1:30:48] Someone hears a piece of music says,
[1:30:49] "Oh,
[1:30:53] I got invited once many years ago. I got
[1:30:57] to know the uh
[1:31:00] he was the symphony director in Victoria
[1:31:03] and he wanted me to do something for him
[1:31:05] and so I was attempting to do what he
[1:31:07] wanted me to do and he invited me to
[1:31:09] come to the symphony.
[1:31:12] So I took my wife and we went to the
[1:31:15] symphony. It just all I could do to stay
[1:31:18] awake. And here's other people. Oh,
[1:31:21] they're just raptured by this beautiful
[1:31:24] symphony music. And I like symphony, but
[1:31:27] somehow I got bored with that symphony.
[1:31:30] I couldn't understand it. And the only
[1:31:31] thing I could get bored more with would
[1:31:33] be ballet or something else. And
[1:31:37] somebody playing, you know, one of these
[1:31:38] things. and and I I've heard I've heard
[1:31:42] some of this high screeching
[1:31:45] and I've said to my wife cuz my hearing
[1:31:47] isn't all that good. Do you understand
[1:31:49] any word yet?
[1:31:51] I've heard some choirs and the choirs I
[1:31:54] love music and the choirs sing and it's
[1:31:57] a it's a you know several hundred voice
[1:32:00] choir and it's all up
[1:32:04] so and all I wonder I just want to hear
[1:32:07] the words. What are they saying?
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Have you heard a word yet? My wife's got
[1:32:12] excellent hearing and she loves music,
[1:32:14] too. So I say, "Have you heard a word
[1:32:16] yet?" No, I don't understand them. What
[1:32:19] good is their singing if you don't
[1:32:21] understand it?
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; It it isn't that is that reasonable?
[1:32:28] I happened to be in a service
[1:32:31] and uh brother Brandon was the speaker
[1:32:36] and a woman got up and she had a very
[1:32:39] very fine voice and I say that rather
[1:32:43] loosely
[1:32:46] but she could reach way up into the you
[1:32:49] know the degrees that would hurt could
[1:32:52] hurt the normal eard drum
[1:32:55] and she got up and sang just before
[1:32:57] Brother Brandham was to come out and
[1:32:58] preach. And she sang The Holy City. And
[1:33:01] for those of you that don't know that
[1:33:03] song, I mean, that song's got an
[1:33:05] incredible
[1:33:06] range. And she could reach it way up
[1:33:09] there and hold it.
[1:33:16] It's incredible. And Brother Brandham's
[1:33:18] in the back someplace, you know, he's or
[1:33:21] maybe he's still in the car. I don't
[1:33:23] know. And he comes in, he says, 'Oh, oh,
[1:33:26] he said, 'I love the I love good music
[1:33:29] and I love when people, you know, sing
[1:33:32] and worship. He says, something I can't
[1:33:34] stand is when people just screech way up
[1:33:36] there and and and he and he described
[1:33:38] her song perfectly. And I just, oh,
[1:33:43] I shut my kind of hid my face because I
[1:33:47] thought, my goodness, he described it
[1:33:50] right to the ladder.
[1:33:53] No,
[1:33:54] some people love that. I don't know why,
[1:33:57] but they love it.
[1:33:59] And I don't, and I don't know why I
[1:34:01] don't love it, but I I like to
[1:34:02] understand what do I have some friends
[1:34:05] here? You like to understand what's
[1:34:06] being said?
[1:34:09] So, we're impressed with different
[1:34:10] things
[1:34:12] and and pay, you know, they try to say,
[1:34:14] well, no, I'm not impressed.
[1:34:17] as soon as they say somebody won the
[1:34:19] lottery
[1:34:20] and they just won $5.49 million or
[1:34:23] whatever it was.
[1:34:27] Yeah. Don't tell me you don't get
[1:34:29] impressed. You started think, man, what
[1:34:31] I couldn't do with that. We're impressed
[1:34:34] with that. A few days ago, a lady in
[1:34:36] Florida died.
[1:34:39] And she lived a very frugal life.
[1:34:42] Maybe some of you have read about her. I
[1:34:44] don't even know how we heard, but it's
[1:34:45] just the last few days. And she she
[1:34:48] lived in a small condominium.
[1:34:51] And when she died, which is just I think
[1:34:54] last week, she left her estate. And
[1:34:57] nobody nobody even knew she had an
[1:34:59] estate. She lived she she didn't live
[1:35:02] poor, but she just lived very frugal in
[1:35:05] a small condominium.
[1:35:07] She had had trouble with one lung and
[1:35:10] had it operated on for whether it was
[1:35:13] cancer or something, I can't remember.
[1:35:15] And she had two brothers that had died
[1:35:17] from a certain disease. And she left her
[1:35:20] entire estate and she would not let
[1:35:22] anybody know that she had an estate
[1:35:25] because she did not want any credit and
[1:35:28] she did not want it. It could not be
[1:35:30] announced till after she was dead to
[1:35:33] make sure that she wouldn't get any
[1:35:35] attention or any credit for what she had
[1:35:37] done. She wanted to be completely
[1:35:40] anonymous. And she gave 35.6 million to
[1:35:45] charity to one charity for to help to
[1:35:50] find an answer to this disease that had
[1:35:53] taken her brothers and uh I think she g
[1:35:56] left it to two charities. Well, people
[1:35:58] are impressed. I mean, people are
[1:35:59] impressed, but there's nobody to, you
[1:36:01] know, there's nobody to exalt. There's
[1:36:03] nobody to get impressed with it. She
[1:36:06] just gave it freely. And that's that's
[1:36:08] just the last few days ago. But people
[1:36:10] become impressed with various things.
[1:36:12] Now, I said all of that
[1:36:15] to say here's how the antichrist spirit
[1:36:19] actually moved in. Satan does not how
[1:36:24] how did a third of the angels of heaven
[1:36:26] become drawn by Lucifer? Because they
[1:36:30] were impressed with him.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; They were impressed with him. He held a
[1:36:37] status. He held a position. And they
[1:36:41] were impressed with him. They were
[1:36:43] impressed with whatever he presented to
[1:36:45] them. And now he's on in in in Eden
[1:36:48] trying to do the same thing, the same
[1:36:50] exact spirit. Say, "Oh, well, we see it
[1:36:54] there. We see it in Eden. Where's it
[1:36:56] here?"
[1:36:58] Don't worry, it's right here.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; You still with me?
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; And so now, Brother Brandham takes it.
[1:37:08] He says, "And notice the stages.
[1:37:11] The first stage he came,
[1:37:14] the first stage he came in, the Holy
[1:37:16] Ghost fell and the people had everything
[1:37:21] in common. And the spirit of God was
[1:37:24] upon them. And the apostles went from
[1:37:28] house to house breaking bread with the
[1:37:31] people. And there was great signs and
[1:37:34] wonders wrought. And then the first
[1:37:37] thing you know, Satan began to cause a
[1:37:40] murmur to come up. And then after a
[1:37:44] while, these slaves, these slaves and
[1:37:48] the poor of the land had received the
[1:37:51] Holy Ghost and they went out into
[1:37:54] different places testifying. They
[1:37:57] testified to their masters.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; So now the poor people, blessed are the
[1:38:03] poor, they have the gospel preached to
[1:38:04] them. the poor had received the people
[1:38:07] from the street. Where did you and I
[1:38:10] come from? Uh we haven't come from some
[1:38:13] eloquent perhaps sophisticated community
[1:38:17] but the people then they came and they
[1:38:20] became the slaves went everywhere and
[1:38:22] they begin to testify
[1:38:25] about what was happening.
[1:38:29] People want to know
[1:38:31] what kind of a message you believe. How
[1:38:33] come? And you all have it. You all have
[1:38:35] had it at one point in time. Why are you
[1:38:38] the way that you are? Where does your
[1:38:40] great strength lie?
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; How is it that you are able to live and
[1:38:50] sustain yourself in this vile generation
[1:38:56] and be what you are? I'm going to ask
[1:38:58] some direct questions. What makes your
[1:39:00] family what it is? What makes the young
[1:39:03] people what they are? What makes the
[1:39:05] ladies what they are? What makes the
[1:39:07] wives what they are? What makes the
[1:39:10] homes what they are? Nothing but the
[1:39:12] word of God.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; And so people are they're they're they
[1:39:19] admire and they're drawn to that.
[1:39:24] You may have had all kinds of uh
[1:39:26] difficulties in your life or in your
[1:39:27] home or with your children or whatever
[1:39:29] more but nevertheless there is a quality
[1:39:32] there is a certain characteristic about
[1:39:35] the word of God the message of the hour
[1:39:38] there is a certain quality which those
[1:39:41] that are around they see it they view it
[1:39:44] some express something don't but it is
[1:39:48] it is readily identified
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; it's readily recogn recognized at least
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; are you following me?
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; I know of what I'm speaking and maybe
[1:40:02] someone
[1:40:04] who you are uh connected with or you are
[1:40:08] you are engaged with might well be that
[1:40:11] they don't voice it. But it' be
[1:40:14] surprising to you if people uh were free
[1:40:18] to say, and some are, and they they make
[1:40:22] some comment about what it is that you
[1:40:25] believe, what it is, where are you
[1:40:27] coming from, and what how is it that you
[1:40:31] have this kind of a this kind of a life,
[1:40:33] this kind of a family, this kind of a
[1:40:35] home.
[1:40:37] And that is not unusual. But the b but
[1:40:40] the prophet is saying that they
[1:40:42] testified to their masters. Now listen,
[1:40:45] I'm getting down to the meat of it.
[1:40:48] And after a while
[1:40:56] and after a while, I want you to hang on
[1:40:59] to that. After a process of time, there
[1:41:04] began to come all like army captains.
[1:41:09] That was in that day because they were
[1:41:12] under a military rule of Rome.
[1:41:15] And so after the Holy Spirit fell and
[1:41:18] signs and wonders and a different kind
[1:41:21] of a life now, now it was not God above
[1:41:24] the people. It was not God with the
[1:41:26] people. It was God in the people. And
[1:41:29] don't tell me that that can't be
[1:41:31] recognized, that can't be seen. You
[1:41:34] can't even hide that when you are born
[1:41:36] again and it's God in the person and you
[1:41:39] are baptized with the Holy Ghost and the
[1:41:42] word becomes flesh in you.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; I declare you can't even hide that.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; You can't hide that. You're a new
[1:41:52] creature in Christ Jesus. You can't hide
[1:41:54] that. And so some people look at it and
[1:41:57] they they are antagonistic against it.
[1:42:00] They don't like that. They don't like to
[1:42:02] be uh uh they don't like to be
[1:42:04] associated with it. They don't like to
[1:42:06] see it. But the other person they admire
[1:42:08] it.
[1:42:11] Lots of people admire what they have
[1:42:13] seen in the message. Do you think that
[1:42:15] the message wasn't admired? You think
[1:42:17] that the life of your life of brother
[1:42:18] Brandham wasn't admired? Admired by
[1:42:21] millions.
[1:42:25] You might as well recognize it. It was
[1:42:26] admired by millions of people.
[1:42:29] And his ministry was admired,
[1:42:34] but it could not pay the price of
[1:42:36] accepting what it took to have that kind
[1:42:40] of a life. Amen.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; And after a while
[1:42:45] begin to come in like army captains and
[1:42:48] the different people, the celebrity
[1:42:52] begin to see the gallantry and the
[1:42:55] miracles and the signs that these men
[1:42:58] done. So they accepted
[1:43:01] they accepted Christianity. Never said
[1:43:04] they were born again. They just accepted
[1:43:07] Christianity. And I see even within the
[1:43:10] realm of the message all kinds of
[1:43:12] people, they see it, they admire it,
[1:43:15] they respect it, and they want it, but
[1:43:19] they never come to birth. They just
[1:43:21] accept it
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; and walk in. And uh and and sometimes
[1:43:26] people of respect, people of stature,
[1:43:29] people of of wealth, people of power,
[1:43:33] people of skills, people of
[1:43:35] intelligence, people of whatever they
[1:43:37] are. They come in at different status,
[1:43:39] different levels. And then from within
[1:43:42] now, and here's the crux of the matter.
[1:43:44] And the prophet is revealing how
[1:43:47] antirist
[1:43:48] spirit got in and how it worked. He's
[1:43:52] uncovering it right here.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; This is where it was. And these people
[1:43:57] came in amongst the the the body of
[1:44:01] believers. And instead of
[1:44:05] them being transformed by the same power
[1:44:09] that made the believers what they were,
[1:44:12] then the body of believers began to be
[1:44:15] influenced
[1:44:17] by what these people were and brought in
[1:44:21] the people under nicicoatanism.
[1:44:26] Nicicoleanism did not come from the
[1:44:28] pulpit. Nickelanism came from an outside
[1:44:32] influence upon the people upon the
[1:44:36] believers and they became impressed with
[1:44:41] sir.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Now watch it real close
[1:44:45] and they accepted Christianity. Well,
[1:44:48] then when they embrace Christianity to
[1:44:52] go down there to a place where they're
[1:44:54] meeting in a little old dark dingy hall
[1:44:57] and clap their hands and shout and speak
[1:45:02] in tongues and getting messages. Why? He
[1:45:05] could never that individual who just
[1:45:08] accepted he could never take he could
[1:45:10] never take that to his competitor or
[1:45:14] whatever it is in his business. He'd
[1:45:17] never believe it like that. Certainly
[1:45:19] not. So, he's got to dress it up.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:45:28] I hope that I'm able to really make
[1:45:30] myself clear.
[1:45:37] It's the dressing up that's the problem.
[1:45:41] Jesus said to the scribes and the
[1:45:44] Pharisees in his time, he said,
[1:45:48] uh,
[1:45:50] you garnish or you dress up or you shine
[1:45:54] up the tombs of the prophets.
[1:45:57] Because in so doing, they were
[1:46:00] identifying themselves with the
[1:46:01] prophets. But they needed to they needed
[1:46:04] to garnish. They needed to dress up.
[1:46:07] they needed to uh embellish the tombs of
[1:46:12] the prophets and and by doing so they
[1:46:15] were taking away kind of the the
[1:46:17] roughness and the and the uh the that
[1:46:20] part of the prophets that caused them to
[1:46:22] be slain back there. They were doing
[1:46:24] away with that. And by doing so, they
[1:46:26] were also saying, "We're we're
[1:46:29] identified with the prophets." And Jesus
[1:46:31] said that you're the children of those
[1:46:33] that slew the prophets, and now you're
[1:46:35] up here centuries later. You're shining
[1:46:38] them all up.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; If time were to go on, there would no
[1:46:43] doubt be an element within the message
[1:46:45] that would try to shine Brother Brenam
[1:46:47] up. Amen.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Try to shine it up to take away the
[1:46:53] perhaps the the course and the uh the uh
[1:46:57] things that would be considered maybe
[1:46:59] crude to be said. But on the other hand,
[1:47:03] some of those things I would say the
[1:47:05] message is as strong as it is because it
[1:47:08] took that to cut you loose.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; And anything less than that would not
[1:47:15] have cut you loose.
[1:47:17] And so then some come in and say, "Well,
[1:47:20] you know, we we need to really embellish
[1:47:23] this. We need to really adorn this. We
[1:47:25] really need" And so these that came in
[1:47:28] from the world, and quite frankly, this
[1:47:31] is exactly what happened. They brought
[1:47:33] in with them their pagan,
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; their pagan rights and rituals. And we
[1:47:40] would not think of them as being pagan
[1:47:42] pagan in the sense that you're going to
[1:47:44] bow down to some idol and do some
[1:47:47] worship. But they brought in their
[1:47:49] ideas. They brought in their thought on
[1:47:52] this thing and they had their
[1:47:54] suggestion. And so then the people, you
[1:47:58] know, they're uh humble believers of the
[1:48:01] message and they they say, "Well, you
[1:48:04] know, I'm not of the status this
[1:48:06] individual is. I don't have their
[1:48:08] skills. I don't have their respect. The
[1:48:11] these are people of of you know notable
[1:48:14] people. These are people of renown. And
[1:48:17] so it it turns out then that they begin
[1:48:21] to influence and affect the very work of
[1:48:24] God
[1:48:26] when in fact the thing that should be we
[1:48:29] should be impressed with is the is the
[1:48:32] word. And brother Brandon talk about
[1:48:34] being impressed with the word. I am
[1:48:37] impressed as I as I pondered this
[1:48:39] message today. I'm impressed with the
[1:48:41] vindication of this message. I'm very
[1:48:44] impressed with it. I've been impressed
[1:48:46] with it for 30ome years now. I'm
[1:48:49] impressed that God could take a man and
[1:48:52] speak through his mouth and tell people
[1:48:55] their sins or their diseases or
[1:48:58] whatever. I'm impressed with that. And I
[1:49:00] want God to hear. I'm impressed with
[1:49:02] that. I'm impressed with what you did in
[1:49:04] this generation. I'm impressed with the
[1:49:06] manifestation of the word of God. I'm
[1:49:09] impressed with what it does in an
[1:49:11] individual's life. I'm impressed that
[1:49:14] people have been able to stand year
[1:49:16] after year after year under a under in
[1:49:19] the uh condition of such degradation in
[1:49:23] this generation that they've been able
[1:49:25] to withstand it. I'm impressed with
[1:49:27] that. I'm impressed with the young
[1:49:29] people that can stand in this
[1:49:31] promiscuous society and remain virgin
[1:49:34] before God. I'm impressed with that.
[1:49:37] Hallelujah.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; I'm impressed with the gospel of Jesus
[1:49:45] Christ. I'm impressed with this message.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; And that's what impresses me.
[1:49:51] I'm impressed that we could remain year
[1:49:54] after year after year and remain in the
[1:49:57] simplicity of the gospel of Jesus
[1:49:59] Christ.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; We're not here. Our calling is not for
[1:50:05] refinement,
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; not to refine things like they do in the
[1:50:10] food industry. Refine it and refine it
[1:50:12] until there's no food value there any
[1:50:14] longer. And they refine the gospel.
[1:50:17] refine it and refine it and Greek it and
[1:50:20] Hebrew it until it the the essence of it
[1:50:22] is gone. We want the Holy Spirit
[1:50:26] of God to take the word and drive it
[1:50:29] down into the hearts of the people that
[1:50:31] they come in here one way and go out
[1:50:34] changed and go out affected, go out
[1:50:37] impressed.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That was the Antichrist
[1:50:41] spirit. That's how it came in. That's
[1:50:43] how it came into the church in the early
[1:50:46] church. And those early saints became
[1:50:50] impressed.
[1:50:52] We're impressed with success.
[1:50:55] When people have success, I'm not
[1:50:56] impressed really with failure. But don't
[1:51:00] be very careful that something can
[1:51:02] appear to be failure and be a great
[1:51:05] success. Amen.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; There's people who struggle through life
[1:51:12] and you that may be in this state. You
[1:51:15] may be struggle with life. You may
[1:51:17] struggle with the difficulties of life.
[1:51:19] You may struggle financially. You may
[1:51:22] struggle emotionally. You may struggle
[1:51:25] with a lot of things. And we all have
[1:51:28] our own unique special difficulties.
[1:51:31] But remember one thing that shall never
[1:51:35] affect your spiritual life or your
[1:51:38] spiritual calling. If God has called you
[1:51:41] into this life, he didn't call you to be
[1:51:43] a failure. He called you to be a
[1:51:45] victorious success.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; And success is not measured by how high
[1:51:50] a person's gone in their job, how many
[1:51:52] promotions they have, how many raises
[1:51:55] they have, how much money they have,
[1:51:57] what kind of a house they live in, or
[1:51:59] what kind of a car. That has nothing to
[1:52:01] do with success. Absolutely nothing to
[1:52:03] do with it. And no one should no one
[1:52:05] should feel under any imposition to kind
[1:52:08] of bow or kind of give uh you know
[1:52:11] respect to someone simply because they
[1:52:14] they are obviously successful. That
[1:52:16] doesn't have anything to do with it. I
[1:52:18] want the man that can go on his knees
[1:52:20] and look up to heaven and make contact
[1:52:23] with God. That's the person you want
[1:52:26] when you're in need and you want to call
[1:52:28] somebody. You want to call somebody you
[1:52:30] know has a hold of God and can speak and
[1:52:33] can pray and God will hear them.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of Christ in the
[1:52:41] congregation.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; So he's got to dress it up.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; It's going to be just a few more
[1:52:51] minutes. I'm going to let you go.
[1:52:54] He says, "So they begin to get together.
[1:52:58] They they've got to dress it up. So they
[1:53:00] begin to get together
[1:53:03] and to think. That was a bad that's big
[1:53:06] serious problem.
[1:53:09] Get together and to begin to think. Now
[1:53:11] we'll form something a little different.
[1:53:19] I tell you what, friends, that's the
[1:53:22] seal.
[1:53:24] That is what I've been talking about for
[1:53:26] the last 15 20 minutes. That's the white
[1:53:29] horse rider.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; And that's how he operates. And that's
[1:53:35] how he gets in. He brings in something
[1:53:38] of of glamour,
[1:53:40] something of beauty because he is a
[1:53:43] creature of beauty.
[1:53:46] and he catches the attention of the
[1:53:47] people
[1:53:51] and and he and and he makes them his
[1:53:54] purpose is to get them impressed.
[1:53:56] So they're impressed with that. Let me
[1:53:58] say something here too quickly.
[1:54:02] There's an element within society
[1:54:06] and and and it's very very evident in in
[1:54:09] our time and that is people have uh
[1:54:14] they've kicked over all the you know
[1:54:17] they don't want to be identified with
[1:54:18] anything that is uh neat
[1:54:22] or tidy you know put the roughest old
[1:54:25] hat I can on and and
[1:54:29] excuse me brothers and let me have, you
[1:54:32] know,
[1:54:34] four day beard always on. I don't know
[1:54:36] where that come from.
[1:54:38] Uh, but anyway, I just had one, so I'm
[1:54:42] not making a religion out of it, but let
[1:54:44] me be just as rough as I can.
[1:54:47] And uh
[1:54:52] I've seen young people, not so young
[1:54:54] either, and girls are young ladies are
[1:54:57] worse than the fellas,
[1:54:59] come with such terribly torn holes in
[1:55:02] their jeans
[1:55:05] that I'm ready to offer them a pair of
[1:55:06] mine that I ready to throw away.
[1:55:10] And then I find out those that I got big
[1:55:12] holes in, they're worth more money than
[1:55:14] a brand new pair.
[1:55:16] So people buy those.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Excuse me.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; They buy those things.
[1:55:24] I've thrown away a lot better ones than
[1:55:26] that.
[1:55:27] Where does that come from? Well, because
[1:55:30] you know it's rough and rugged and be a
[1:55:34] little on the dirty side. And people
[1:55:36] kind of glory in that. They kind of
[1:55:38] glory in being, you know, walking on
[1:55:42] their pants and wearing the What am I
[1:55:46] saying? That doesn't impress me either.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; But some people are impressed with it.
[1:55:56] They're actually impressed with it.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; They're impressed with the slouch.
[1:56:00] They're impressed with what you know
[1:56:04] and it's it's weird.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; It's really weird.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; You know where I'm coming from.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; And so some are impressed with that.
[1:56:15] Some are impressed with the refinement.
[1:56:17] You know, I think for the believer, you
[1:56:19] say, "What is what what what should be
[1:56:21] our station? What should be our what
[1:56:23] should be our status?" I think we should
[1:56:26] live simply
[1:56:28] live with what I believe that God can
[1:56:32] give you a good suit of clothes. You can
[1:56:35] be clean. That should have no effect on
[1:56:39] coming into the house of God. If you
[1:56:41] haven't got a suit, that's fine. Wear
[1:56:43] the best p best pair of pants you have.
[1:56:46] Wear the best dress that you have. Come
[1:56:48] into the house of God. And that's all
[1:56:50] God requires a clean heart. He and and
[1:56:54] we come in here and we should be just uh
[1:56:57] we should be sincere people just be
[1:56:59] sincere and and more than sincerity we
[1:57:03] we should respect the house of God
[1:57:06] respect our homes respect those that we
[1:57:08] have around us and and if God blesses
[1:57:11] you fine if God doesn't bless you
[1:57:14] financially or material or whatever more
[1:57:16] that that has nothing to do with our
[1:57:18] spiritual life
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; understand and we need to ask what What
[1:57:23] are we impressed with?
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; I want you to ask yourself, what what
[1:57:26] are we really impressed with? Well,
[1:57:28] there's a brother over here really doing
[1:57:30] well, and there's a sister over here,
[1:57:31] and my oh my, they've they've made a lot
[1:57:33] of money, or they've done a lot of this,
[1:57:35] or what? Well, what's that got to do
[1:57:37] with it?
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; I can tell you, maybe they did, but it
[1:57:41] has nothing to do with the gospel of
[1:57:43] Jesus Christ. Has nothing to do with the
[1:57:46] house of God. Has nothing to do with the
[1:57:48] worship in the house of God. you know,
[1:57:51] where we're just not impressed with
[1:57:52] those things. Can you say amen?
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Can I just have five minutes and I'm
[1:57:57] going to close at 12:30.
[1:58:07] The scripture says, I want to give some
[1:58:08] scriptures. My brethren,
[1:58:12] have not the faith of our Lord Jesus
[1:58:14] Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect
[1:58:17] of persons. have not the faith of Jesus
[1:58:21] Christ with respect of persons. For if
[1:58:24] there if if there come one come unto
[1:58:27] your assembly a man with a gold ring in
[1:58:30] goodly apparel and there come in one
[1:58:33] also a poor man in vile raignment. Now
[1:58:37] the scripture is very clear. One man
[1:58:39] comes in, he's got goodly apparel. He's
[1:58:41] got a gold ring. The other man, he
[1:58:44] didn't say he comes in with vile
[1:58:45] raignment. Says he's a poor man.
[1:58:49] and he comes in with vile raignment
[1:58:53] and you have respect to him that wearth
[1:58:55] a gay clothing and say unto him sit thou
[1:58:59] here in a good place and say to the poor
[1:59:02] stand thou there or sit here under my
[1:59:05] foottool said are ye not then partial in
[1:59:08] yourselves and are become judges of evil
[1:59:12] thoughts so it's not a spiritual thought
[1:59:15] it's not it's not what God respects Now
[1:59:18] the if we want to know what respect of
[1:59:20] persons is, it is partiality.
[1:59:24] The fault the fault of one who when
[1:59:29] called on to give judgment has respect
[1:59:32] of the outward circumstances of man and
[1:59:36] not to their intrinsic merits, not to
[1:59:40] their their qualities within. And so he
[1:59:43] prefers or so prefers as the more worthy
[1:59:48] one who is rich, highborn or powerful to
[1:59:53] another who does not have these
[1:59:56] qualities. The Bible is very very clear.
[2:00:00] There are people that are poor
[2:00:04] but are rich in faith. Amen.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; I say that is what the message that I
[2:00:10] believe that's what it brings forth. It
[2:00:13] it it is there to take those that are
[2:00:16] poor but yet rich in faith.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to close on this.
[2:00:25] We've all heard about Balum
[2:00:28] and the scripture tells us
[2:00:31] I've just read it. You don't have to
[2:00:33] turn to it.
[2:00:36] It says this, "Woe unto them for they
[2:00:39] have gone in the way of Cain." That's
[2:00:42] the way of Cain. They've ran greedily
[2:00:45] after the hour of Balum
[2:00:48] for reward and perished in the gains of
[2:00:52] Kora. It's the way, the hour, and the
[2:00:55] gains.
[2:00:56] But in Balam's case, and Balam was a
[2:00:59] prophet as Moses was a prophet. Brother
[2:01:02] Brandham says he was a prophet. He's a
[2:01:05] man of status.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; He's a man that's respected. He's a man
[2:01:09] that's anointed.
[2:01:12] And he says the error of Balum. What was
[2:01:15] the error of Balum? Bailo the king
[2:01:20] of a heathen country sent people. Well,
[2:01:24] I won't say they're heathen. Moab, I
[2:01:26] believe it was. And he wanted Balam to
[2:01:31] come and curse Israel.
[2:01:34] And as you know he came and he couldn't
[2:01:38] curse. No, first he wouldn't come and
[2:01:40] then he sent greater people more
[2:01:43] renowned people and tried to persuade
[2:01:46] him and he wouldn't come and finally
[2:01:47] even greater people came and offered him
[2:01:50] great reward and it was at the re at the
[2:01:53] reward and these great people that were
[2:01:56] renowned sent right from the king and so
[2:01:59] he went
[2:02:01] to curse Israel. when he got to the
[2:02:03] country, he told them ahead of time, I
[2:02:06] can only say what God will give me to
[2:02:08] say. And incidentally, friends, he uh
[2:02:16] do you know that Balum said one of the
[2:02:18] most beautiful pieces of literature
[2:02:23] about Israel?
[2:02:25] Balam, a false prophet, gave one of the
[2:02:27] most beautiful.
[2:02:32] Listen to what he says. And with this
[2:02:34] I'm closing.
[2:02:37] And he took up this Balam speaking. And
[2:02:40] he took up this parable and said, Balam
[2:02:42] the son of Bor hath said, and the man
[2:02:45] whose eyes are open hath said, he's
[2:02:48] speaking of himself.
[2:02:50] He hath said, which heard the words of
[2:02:53] God, and knew the knowledge of the most
[2:02:56] high, which saw the vision of the
[2:02:58] Almighty, falling into a trance, but
[2:03:00] having his eyes open. He's describing
[2:03:03] his experience. I shall see him, but not
[2:03:07] now. I shall behold him, but not nigh.
[2:03:10] There shall come a star out of Jacob,
[2:03:13] and a scepter shall rise out of Israel,
[2:03:16] and shall smite the corners of Moab, and
[2:03:19] destroy all the children of Sheth, and
[2:03:22] Edom shall be a possession. Sier shall
[2:03:26] be a possession for his enemies. And
[2:03:29] Israel shall do valiantly. Out of Jo,
[2:03:32] out of Jacob shall come. He that shall
[2:03:35] have dominion, and shall destroy him
[2:03:38] that remainth of the city. And when he
[2:03:40] looked on Amalecch, he took up his
[2:03:43] parable and said, Amalecch was the first
[2:03:46] of the nations. But he but his latter
[2:03:48] end shall be that he perish forever. And
[2:03:52] he looked on the Kennites and took up
[2:03:55] this parable, and said, Strong is thy
[2:03:58] dwelling place, and thou putest thy neck
[2:04:01] in a thy nest in a rock. Nevertheless,
[2:04:04] the Kennite shall be wasted and until
[2:04:07] Asher shall carry thee away captive. And
[2:04:10] he took up this parable and said, Alas,
[2:04:13] who shall live when God doeth this? And
[2:04:16] ships shall come from the coast of
[2:04:18] Chhatim, and shall afflict Asher, and
[2:04:21] shall afflict Abber, and he shall he
[2:04:25] shall perish forever. And Balam rose up,
[2:04:28] and went and returned to his place, and
[2:04:31] Bailac went his way. And the two of them
[2:04:33] went to their own direction. Now listen
[2:04:35] to the next verse. And Israel abodeed in
[2:04:39] Shatim. And the people began to commit
[2:04:42] whoredom with the daughters of Moab. And
[2:04:46] they called the people under the
[2:04:48] sacrifices of their gods. And the people
[2:04:51] did eat and bowed down to their gods.
[2:04:56] And Israel joined himself unto Baalpure.
[2:05:00] And the anger of the Lord was kindled
[2:05:03] against Israel.
[2:05:05] Even though this anointed prophet, he
[2:05:09] how this whole thing happened was that
[2:05:12] he was impressed with the status of the
[2:05:16] people that king sent to him and was
[2:05:20] enticed by the possibility of reward.
[2:05:24] But he had settled in his heart. He
[2:05:26] would only say what God would allow him
[2:05:28] to say. But nevertheless, he went
[2:05:30] anyway.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; And by going, he influenced others
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; who did not have the same thing that he
[2:05:40] had in his own heart that he would only
[2:05:42] say what God would have him to say. But
[2:05:45] when he got there, he blessed Israel,
[2:05:48] which which just confounded Bailac and
[2:05:51] made Bailac angry and said, "You've
[2:05:54] said, I've called you to curse of Israel
[2:05:57] and you've blessed them." Yeah.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; So the whole thing went sideways as far
[2:06:01] as bail was concerned, but the whole
[2:06:03] thing went sideways as far as God was
[2:06:05] concerned because Balum went down there
[2:06:09] and and made a way as it was gave an
[2:06:11] example and the people ended up down
[2:06:14] there.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Even though the leader escaped it, the
[2:06:18] people got drawn in. Are you following
[2:06:21] me? The people got drawn in. And that
[2:06:23] was the reward of Balum. Balam went
[2:06:26] there for reward. It didn't happen. He
[2:06:29] went his way. Bailac went his way. But
[2:06:31] the people fell into idolatry through
[2:06:34] it.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; You know, I was a young man
[2:06:42] when what is known today as the
[2:06:43] charismatic movement
[2:06:47] spread like a spread like a prairie
[2:06:50] fire. And there are some of you here,
[2:06:53] you've been in Pentecost. You have been
[2:06:55] in full gospel. You've been to see. You
[2:06:59] have lived to see the charismatic
[2:07:00] movement. Don't tell me that that wasn't
[2:07:02] a a real wave, a real move.
[2:07:06] And I sat in churches and watched those
[2:07:10] that were coming in
[2:07:13] from all other all other I sat in a
[2:07:16] church. I saw them come in from the
[2:07:18] Anglican Church, Church of England, from
[2:07:21] the United Church. Yes. Catholics. Many
[2:07:24] of them come in from the Catholic
[2:07:25] church. I saw them coming in from all
[2:07:28] manner of churches. And I sat there and
[2:07:30] I observed. I'm going to tell you
[2:07:32] something I've never told you.
[2:07:35] I was one troubled person.
[2:07:38] My wife,
[2:07:40] even my children who were very young at
[2:07:42] that time, I was one troubled person. As
[2:07:46] I saw the people come in, I saw the
[2:07:49] jangling earrings.
[2:07:51] I saw all the uh makeup.
[2:07:58] Now, now bear with me. Bear with me. I
[2:08:01] stood on the I sat on the front row
[2:08:03] where these brothers are sitting. I've
[2:08:06] even been right at the altar
[2:08:09] and I watched women wash their makeup
[2:08:13] off their face with tears of repentance.
[2:08:16] I saw them wash the rouge off their face
[2:08:19] and the mascara around their eyes and
[2:08:21] wash it. Who told them to do that? I
[2:08:23] don't know.
[2:08:25] Wasn't me. Wasn't the preacher. And
[2:08:27] they're sitting right and I'm standing
[2:08:29] right there just as a boy and looking at
[2:08:31] them saying they're cleaning their face.
[2:08:34] They're washing their face. And then
[2:08:36] years later saw them start to put it
[2:08:40] back on.
[2:08:41] Is it a logical question? Was that the
[2:08:44] Holy Ghost telling to wash it off or is
[2:08:46] the Holy Ghost now tell him to put it
[2:08:47] on?
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; Sister Lana Maria is sitting here.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Sister Lana, you won't mind me
[2:08:57] describing. She came into one of the
[2:08:59] first services. She first came to a
[2:09:02] wedding to take pictures and I'll say
[2:09:05] she was very finely dressed.
[2:09:08] very fine, attractive young woman come
[2:09:11] in and beautifully dressed and all made
[2:09:14] up and has her earrings on something
[2:09:16] that would be very very uh very much
[2:09:18] admired in the world. And then she came
[2:09:21] to a service
[2:09:23] came I think to the very next service
[2:09:26] and one of the brothers who was a deacon
[2:09:28] came up to me and he says this this
[2:09:30] woman wants to be baptized.
[2:09:33] Well, I said I would have to talk to
[2:09:35] her.
[2:09:37] Here she was with all sitting in the
[2:09:39] service, all these jangling earrings and
[2:09:40] all the rest of it. I wasn't going to
[2:09:42] take her to the baptismal tank that way.
[2:09:45] And so
[2:09:47] I went I went to the back and and joined
[2:09:49] her at the back and wanted have some
[2:09:52] counsel with her before she should be
[2:09:54] baptized. And the intent of my heart was
[2:09:56] this young woman needs to wait. She
[2:09:58] needs to hear what this gospel is all
[2:10:00] about. And she needs to know she can't
[2:10:01] go to a tank like that. And so I'm I'm
[2:10:04] walking. Oh, she says, "Brother Ed," she
[2:10:06] says, 'You know, I said, uh, uh, you
[2:10:08] know, God has just been speaking to me
[2:10:09] in such a way. I said, well, listen,
[2:10:10] Sister Wana, I have to say something to
[2:10:12] you. Yes, yes, yes, I know. I know. I
[2:10:13] said, no, I have to say something to
[2:10:15] you. And she was ahead of me all the
[2:10:16] time. And I said, yeah. She says, "Oh, I
[2:10:19] know. He's been speaking to me so much.
[2:10:20] He's been speaking to me so much, by the
[2:10:21] way." I said, "Well, listen, uh, Lana,
[2:10:24] before you go to the baptismal tank, you
[2:10:25] know, I can't take the baptismal tank
[2:10:27] with, you know, with all these earrings
[2:10:29] and stuff." Oh, no, no. She says, "I
[2:10:30] know. I took them all off." She was
[2:10:31] holding them in her hand. Says, "I I've
[2:10:33] taken them all off." She, you know, she
[2:10:35] was all, she was already prepared to go
[2:10:36] to the tank and she's holding all that
[2:10:38] in her hand. I said, "Okay,
[2:10:42] come on to the tank." And we baptized
[2:10:44] her in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:10:46] Christ. And that's a lot of years ago
[2:10:48] and she's still here and we're happy
[2:10:50] over that. I tell you what, but when I
[2:10:52] saw them come in and I saw them and and
[2:10:54] it seemed like those that had been
[2:10:57] filled with the Holy Ghost, speaking in
[2:10:59] tongues, prophesying all kinds of
[2:11:01] anointing on them and everything else,
[2:11:03] they were delighted to see that God was
[2:11:06] receiving people in pants, receiving
[2:11:09] them with all kinds of makeup on and all
[2:11:12] the world hanging on them. And and
[2:11:14] instead of instead of that power from
[2:11:18] the inside working out, they let the
[2:11:20] outside influence the inside. And they
[2:11:23] were just delighted. Oh, I guess that's,
[2:11:25] you know, God will accept that. And so
[2:11:27] on went all of the pant clothes and all
[2:11:30] went on the cutting of the hair and all
[2:11:32] went on and all of that. And I actually
[2:11:34] watched back. I was sick.
[2:11:37] I was sick.
[2:11:39] I went into one with this. I'm going to
[2:11:41] close. I went into one. My children were
[2:11:43] there.
[2:11:48] and they went into a sanctuary. And now
[2:11:50] we're going to begin to
[2:11:54] have communion.
[2:11:58] And the two men who are both ministers
[2:12:02] of the Anglican church were going to
[2:12:04] give communion. I had just seen them
[2:12:06] standing outside having a cigarette
[2:12:08] each.
[2:12:10] And they came in. I didn't know what
[2:12:11] they were going to do. all these people,
[2:12:13] the charismatic movement. I just what
[2:12:15] are they going to do? And I sat there
[2:12:19] and then they're going to have
[2:12:20] communion. And I said to my family,
[2:12:23] stand up. I said, these men will never
[2:12:26] give me communion.
[2:12:29] We're going to walk out in the name of
[2:12:31] the Lord. And we just departed the
[2:12:34] place.
[2:12:36] Never saw it. The only time in my life I
[2:12:37] was there. But friends, that is the
[2:12:40] spirit. And look where they are today.
[2:12:43] Look where it's gone to today. Look
[2:12:45] where it is today. I mean, it is
[2:12:47] showmanship. It is, you know, glamour.
[2:12:51] It is taken over by beauty and all of
[2:12:53] those things. And there are there are
[2:12:57] and there will continue to be those that
[2:13:00] have that uh they've come out of that
[2:13:04] and they come into the message. I say to
[2:13:06] you as believers of the message, one
[2:13:08] thing that we must resolve in our hearts
[2:13:11] that what changed you must change them.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? What changed you must
[2:13:20] change them. We never will be impressed
[2:13:24] with that uh element of the world and
[2:13:27] and and and the the uh the way that they
[2:13:32] live or the way that they you know
[2:13:34] conduct themselves. There's a language
[2:13:37] of the world.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; You know that there's a language of the
[2:13:41] world. I don't want the language.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; I don't want that language in the house
[2:13:45] of God.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; There's a standard that the world has.
[2:13:48] That's not our standard.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; It's not our standard. There's a a
[2:13:52] conduct of love of life. There's there's
[2:13:54] a conduct there's a demeanor. There's a
[2:13:57] there's a way that people have their
[2:13:59] homes, have their families. That's not
[2:14:01] the way we do it. We have the way that
[2:14:03] God has instructed us. Can you say amen
[2:14:06] to it?
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; I've been over my time, but I'm not
[2:14:09] going to apologize over it. You're going
[2:14:11] to have to be home and get refreshed and
[2:14:15] uh come back for the service tonight.
[2:14:17] Amen. And I wonder if we can just stand.
[2:14:26] Our Father,
[2:14:28] which art in heaven,
[2:14:30] hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come,
[2:14:33] thy will be done on earth as it is in
[2:14:36] heaven. We've come today to stand in
[2:14:39] your holy August presence. And thank you
[2:14:41] for your word which is forever settled
[2:14:44] in heaven. and heaven and earth may pass
[2:14:46] away, but your word will never pass
[2:14:48] away. Lord, today I stand here before
[2:14:52] these people to rejoice in your name and
[2:14:55] to rejoice in your power. To rejoice in
[2:14:58] the fact that you have uncovered, you've
[2:15:01] completely uncovered the enemy's
[2:15:03] tactics. You've uncovered his method.
[2:15:07] You've uncovered how he attempts to do
[2:15:09] things. And we see how this white horse
[2:15:11] rider has ridden his ride all down
[2:15:15] through the history of time. And oh God,
[2:15:18] how I thank you for this message that
[2:15:20] you have un uncovered his tactic,
[2:15:23] uncovered his method, Lord. And I pray,
[2:15:25] Father, that you will give us each one
[2:15:27] as individuals. Give us a a depth of
[2:15:31] integrity. Give us a depth, oh God, of
[2:15:34] insight that we will not be ever taken,
[2:15:38] Lord. that we will not be drawn aside,
[2:15:41] that we will not be uh uh we will not
[2:15:44] let our standards lower, oh God, but to
[2:15:47] raise them up high and to live valiantly
[2:15:50] a gallant life for the gospel of Jesus
[2:15:54] Christ. Oh God, I dedicate this assembly
[2:15:57] to you in the name of Jesus Christ. I
[2:16:00] dedicate these families, these
[2:16:01] individuals. Lord, how I thank you for
[2:16:03] the faithful ones, Lord, that have come
[2:16:06] in, have been transformed by the
[2:16:08] transforming power and have continued
[2:16:10] year after year after year, have raised
[2:16:13] their families, have given them the
[2:16:14] example. And I pray, oh God, you'll
[2:16:16] honor their prayer, honor their desire.
[2:16:19] We're looking forward to seeing the
[2:16:21] mighty power of God in demonstration, in
[2:16:24] signs and wonders. And the greatest sign
[2:16:26] I want to see, Lord, I want to see the
[2:16:28] salvation. There are some that are
[2:16:30] sitting here that are praying for their
[2:16:33] young people, for their children, for
[2:16:35] their partners, husbands and wives and
[2:16:37] whatever more. Sweep in, oh God, with
[2:16:40] the mighty power of the Holy Spirit and
[2:16:43] loose them, I pray, from the clutches of
[2:16:46] demon powers. Set them free, oh God, and
[2:16:49] transform their lives. I pray in the
[2:16:52] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:59] Hallelujah. I'd like to sing since he
[2:17:02] reached down his hand for me as we close
[2:17:06] the service now.

[2:20:56] what privileged people we are
[2:21:01] that you reached down your hand and
[2:21:04] found us in the state we were in.
[2:21:07] [Music]
[2:21:08] Lord, I just want to
[2:21:10] come to you in a personal way
[2:21:14] to give you thanks for the people that
[2:21:17] are standing here today.
[2:21:21] They have journeyied
[2:21:23] some a long distance to be here.
[2:21:27] No God,
[2:21:29] we're preparing our hearts also for this
[2:21:31] evening.
[2:21:33] We dedicate this day to you.
[2:21:37] We've come to give you worship and
[2:21:39] praise.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; We are not living today for ourselves.
[2:21:43] We're living for you. Amen.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; I pray that you will bless, oh God, the
[2:21:48] people as they will now have some
[2:21:51] refreshment and rest to their bodies and
[2:21:55] return quickened.
[2:21:58] Oh God, let I pray your Holy Spirit. Now
[2:22:01] take the words that have been spoken.
[2:22:04] Let it be pondered in the heart.
[2:22:07] Cause light, oh God, to strike, I pray,
[2:22:11] the seed which is the word and let it
[2:22:13] bring forth a life, a life of beauty,
[2:22:18] the life of Jesus Christ. I say, Lord,
[2:22:22] live through me. Live through these
[2:22:25] people
[2:22:27] and may the name of God be glorified in
[2:22:31] the land. I pray father we will follow
[2:22:35] to the objective to our goal unairringly
[2:22:39] that we will follow the leadership of
[2:22:42] your holy spirit. I pray father we'll be
[2:22:45] sensitive each one cause them to be
[2:22:47] sensitive Lord not to the exterior of
[2:22:50] the world around them but maybe from
[2:22:52] their soul may it be Lord they'll be
[2:22:54] sensitive to your leadership
[2:22:57] and on that day Lord
[2:23:00] when this short brief life is passed we
[2:23:04] want to be together and we want to
[2:23:06] rejoice on the other shore in Jesus
[2:23:10] Christ's name we thank you amen Amen.
[2:23:14] And amen.

[2:23:25] love him.
[2:23:29] He loves
[2:23:34] [Music]
[2:23:37] me.
[2:23:39] [Music]
[2:23:43] Hey,
[2:23:47] [Music]
[2:23:55] [Music]
[2:24:08] I say God bless you. Give you a gracious
[2:24:10] afternoon. And as I said to you at the
[2:24:13] beginning of the service that this
[2:24:16] message actually had two parts. The
[2:24:18] first would be largely negative part and
[2:24:21] then a positive part. And now I had to
[2:24:23] give a lot of background to uh kind of
[2:24:27] give a introduction to where I was
[2:24:29] going. And so now next time Lord willing
[2:24:32] I won't have to go through all of that.
[2:24:34] God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus
[2:24:36] name. Amen.
