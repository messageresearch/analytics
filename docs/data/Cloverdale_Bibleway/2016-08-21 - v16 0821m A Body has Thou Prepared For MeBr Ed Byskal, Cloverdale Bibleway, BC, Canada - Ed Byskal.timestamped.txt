[34:05] so clear before
[34:09] our eyes.

[34:13] We find the strength
[34:17] to press on.
[34:21] Have you heard from our Lord?
[34:25] Oh, we have heard from our own
[34:32] life.
[34:34] [Music]
[34:37] And our hearts are rejoicing
[34:43] for what we have in store.
[34:49] We are also
[34:52] the Lord
[34:56] and the saints who God
[35:00] will be changed
[35:03] in a moment
[35:07] and walk through

[35:49] find the strength
[35:52] to press on
[35:55] dear Lord with the prize.
[35:59] Lord

[36:04] [Music]
[36:13] the way
[36:16] to rest.

[36:20] [Music]
[36:30] [Music]
[36:45] Hallelujah.
[36:48] And that's what we're doing.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Are you joining me in pressing on?
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. I have
[36:59] uh a few things that I would like to
[37:02] just mention, not by way of announcement
[37:05] so much, but it is announcement. I want
[37:08] to certainly welcome those that have
[37:10] remained over from the wedding and
[37:14] Sister Linda's parents. I believe are
[37:18] remaining in the area and perhaps here
[37:20] this morning. We are thankful for that.
[37:24] Uh it's now Mr. and Mrs. Adamora,
[37:28] &gt;&gt; David Adamora. And I'm so thankful for
[37:32] the wedding was lovely. It was
[37:34] appropriate. So appropriate. It was so
[37:38] perfect. It was very, very nice. Our
[37:41] brother Joseph Olafi from Nigeria
[37:47] is going to be speaking for us on
[37:50] Wednesday. This Wednesday
[37:52] &gt;&gt; and we'll want to all be here.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. For certain, for certain you won't
[37:58] want to miss our brother Joseph. I
[38:00] wonder if you could stand, please.
[38:03] And this is brother I talk from Nigeria.
[38:07] This is his pastor, brother I talk. if
[38:09] you would stand. We know, brother, I
[38:12] talk well. God bless you.
[38:20] And I'm sorry, brother Joseph, that uh
[38:23] you would have been speaking this
[38:24] morning, but uh I've been away and I
[38:28] think that it's all right. Amen. God
[38:31] bless you. You may have your seat. Uh,
[38:34] also I wanted to
[38:38] uh make a comment. Last Wednesday's
[38:40] service, I wasn't in service. Brother
[38:42] John Andy's was speaking and uh it was a
[38:47] really a very profound service.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; If you haven't heard that service, you
[38:51] want to go back and get it on the
[38:53] archives. It is streaming. I live
[38:57] streamed it. I was at home uh still
[39:00] recovering and uh so uh but it was it
[39:04] was just uh I was completely locked in
[39:08] from the very moment it opened up and I
[39:11] want to thank you brother John for your
[39:14] uh labor of of love and effort. Uh there
[39:17] is just so much but I'm going to be
[39:19] quick. um the Lynen Witness booth and
[39:24] the street witnessing that has been
[39:26] taking place. I've just heard from a
[39:30] number I've heard from quite a few.
[39:32] Thank you, brother Matthew Redell for
[39:34] your efforts. And brother Matthew has
[39:37] said uh the week at the Lynen Fair has
[39:41] been con confirmed by most to be the
[39:44] most fruitful,
[39:46] spiritual and supernatural week we have
[39:49] ever had.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful news? Amen.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; And literally hundreds of conver
[39:55] conversations and witnessing has taken
[39:58] place and we have had such an incredible
[40:02] turnout that every day we are sending
[40:05] numerous ones on the streets uh to
[40:09] contact those coming and going from the
[40:12] fair. Countless testimonies there alone.
[40:17] Uh we have had ones asking for prayer,
[40:20] surrendering their lives, asking so many
[40:24] questions, countless uh countless
[40:29] quality witnesses and no no way to begin
[40:33] to share it this way, which was just by
[40:36] by way of email. So, brother Matthew,
[40:39] most all of us know you, of course, but
[40:42] I'd like you to stand first and then I
[40:44] would like all who were involved in the
[40:48] Lynden fair one way or another. Whether
[40:51] it's preparing here, I would like you to
[40:53] stand, please. All that were at the
[40:55] fair, all that were witnessing, all that
[40:57] were on the streets, all that were here.
[41:00] It's quite a number. Isn't that a
[41:02] impressive number?
[41:04] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[41:06] God bless you for your part. You should
[41:08] be happy that you've had this part.
[41:11] Amen. God bless you.
[41:15] And uh Brother John Andy's also he sent
[41:20] uh he said, "I wanted to send a positive
[41:22] report." This was an email to myself
[41:25] uh of the Lynen Fair witnessing booth. I
[41:29] just returned home
[41:31] from being at the fair booth. I feel by
[41:35] far it was the most successful
[41:37] spiritually effective years so far. The
[41:42] believers was fantastic. The witnessing
[41:47] was very powerful. The testimony was
[41:50] 100% positive. The booth was kept clean
[41:54] and very presentable all week. The you
[41:58] never know what a person is looking at,
[42:00] do you? uh the show of force and
[42:03] presence of the believers was powerful
[42:06] and most often overwhelming.
[42:09] This was in caps a very good year
[42:14] &gt;&gt; for the for the ones that was affected
[42:18] and spoken to. It was great for our
[42:21] people and congregation that
[42:24] participated. It was fantastic. The
[42:27] sisters and the brothers all did so
[42:30] wonderful. I have nothing negative to
[42:33] say. Truly, we are in another book of
[42:37] acts.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; I am impressed and overwhelmed by
[42:41] brother Matthew Redell was superb. Uh he
[42:45] is excellent. He was very good with our
[42:49] people and dynamic and unwavering. Very
[42:53] successful year. Praise the Lord. And I
[42:55] think everyone should say, "Praise the
[42:57] Lord."
[42:59] Amen.
[43:07] I will just say a very few words. You'll
[43:11] probably hear maybe more later from uh
[43:14] those that were attending. But uh we
[43:17] were attending the convention in Germany
[43:20] and uh they had uh announced it as being
[43:23] an international convention and I guess
[43:26] it was indeed international in its uh in
[43:29] its uh attendance and so on uh from this
[43:33] church. Brother Tim Dodd, brother Murphy
[43:36] Wong, brother Mil Rathbar and also
[43:40] attending was sister Melissa Snow and
[43:43] Sister Hopi Robinson.
[43:46] uh attended from the Cloverdale Bible
[43:48] Way Church. Uh there were others that
[43:51] were streaming. One night I walked in on
[43:54] uh one of the evenings and uh Brother
[43:57] David Mayor's nephew was uh look, he's
[44:01] just a young fellow. He would just fit
[44:03] right in. He's probably 19 years old,
[44:06] but he was looking after all the IT work
[44:09] and all the streaming. And just as I
[44:11] passed in, he said, "There are 90
[44:13] countries connected just now."
[44:17] &gt;&gt; That was truly international, I guess,
[44:19] in that sense of the word. Uh we we were
[44:23] just happy for that. And we were happy
[44:25] for brother Coen Brunner, Senior, who he
[44:29] and his family did almost all the work
[44:32] that was involved. They don't run their
[44:35] camp quite like we do, but they at the
[44:38] camp the his family looked after all the
[44:41] bookings, all the rooms and scheduling
[44:46] people and the coming from the airport
[44:49] at uh Stogart and on the way. Uh so
[44:54] there are things behind the scenes that
[44:56] we don't notice and we don't often talk
[45:00] about. My wife and I, we don't often
[45:02] talk about our our difficulties, but I
[45:05] got a text. I'll just say this and then
[45:08] forget it. Uh because the words more
[45:11] important, but I got a text early early
[45:14] the day of our departure saying that our
[45:17] plane was 4 hours late. And uh
[45:22] all right. So, I got on the phone right
[45:23] away immediately with agents of Lufanza.
[45:26] And I said, uh, you know, uh, we need to
[45:28] be, uh, we've got another flight going
[45:32] to Stogart. And I said, well, you won't
[45:34] make that one. This flight would arrive
[45:36] now 3:30 in the morning in Frankfurt.
[45:39] And, uh, she said, but I'll see if we
[45:41] can reroute you and get you uh, to
[45:43] Munich. There's a big plane leaving to
[45:46] Munich every day out of Vancouver. So,
[45:49] nevertheless, they got us booked on that
[45:51] flight. And I said, "Well, we need all
[45:54] this big jumbo 747 now isn't going to
[45:58] get there. They're going to be in a big
[46:01] rush at the airport for seats." So, I
[46:04] said, "We need to get there early." So,
[46:06] we attempted to get there early, but
[46:09] there was indeed a big rush. And uh they
[46:12] didn't hardly have any seats, but they
[46:14] got us on on the plane. And then when we
[46:17] got boarded, we sat there for 2 hours at
[46:21] the gate.
[46:24] It's nice.
[46:27] It's if you like the inside of planes.
[46:29] And uh so we sat there for two hours and
[46:32] I after we finally got going, you know,
[46:35] the problem was I couldn't find a
[46:37] tractor to push us away from the gate.
[46:41] Couldn't find one. It was in the shop
[46:42] someplace. So anyway, we we got off, we
[46:46] got flying, and we're in the air. And so
[46:48] when I arrived, when we arrived and
[46:51] Linda uh was with us, uh she's looking
[46:54] after looking after her mother and doing
[46:56] things and so on, you know. So we
[46:59] arrived and uh uh we only had just a few
[47:03] minutes to catch this other flight that
[47:05] was going to get us to Stoodgard. and
[47:08] we're racing around and I'm trying to
[47:10] talk to staff and and oh no, that
[47:13] flight's been cancelled.
[47:15] Okay, how are we going to get there?
[47:17] Well, we're going to get a bus and take
[47:20] you there and just go down and get your
[47:22] bags and so go through immigration, all
[47:25] the rest of it. So, uh you want the
[47:28] short word for it? It was a nightmare,
[47:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; And we had it in the daytime.
[47:34] So anyway, whenever I go to the airport
[47:37] because uh we're preaching the gospel, I
[47:39] always say to my wife now, now as we go
[47:42] to the airport, the devil's trying to
[47:45] kill us.
[47:46] That's my common phrase which I have I
[47:49] have I have a lot of confirmation for
[47:52] that over all the 25 or 30 years. The
[47:56] devil's trying to kill us. And uh
[48:00] I remember when brother
[48:03] uh
[48:06] brother Gail Ashdown, he had never been
[48:09] on a plane apparently. So I got him on a
[48:12] plane and he came to India with us.
[48:17] That was a nice flight to India to
[48:20] Singapore and then on to India. And uh
[48:24] while we're there amongst the masses of
[48:26] just seas of people just parting as the
[48:30] and the taxis don't slow down, they just
[48:33] they just roar down the street. And the
[48:35] people I thought they're going to kill
[48:37] somebody, you know, we're going to end
[48:38] up here with some dead bodies. And uh
[48:42] the people just, you know, flow out and
[48:44] then flow back in just like the water,
[48:46] you know, and we're driving down. And
[48:49] now I understand why they blow the horn
[48:52] every couple seconds. They just blow the
[48:54] horn and uh
[48:57] Brother Gil was with uh the camera in
[48:59] the front seat. He and the camera, his
[49:02] friend. And uh he just turned around
[49:05] quickly. He said, "Brother Ed, just tell
[49:07] me I'm not in a nightmare."
[49:11] I said, "No, you're you're here and and
[49:15] uh everything is fine." So, but brother
[49:18] Gil put together a wonderful video that
[49:21] you all have seen of India
[49:23] &gt;&gt; and we had that video and it was played
[49:26] for nine years it was used. So, that's
[49:30] wonderful. Well, we've come to hear the
[49:32] word.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; And I'm feeling good and you're feeling
[49:38] good and Amen.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; All right. We'll have you stand and
[49:42] we'll turn to the book of Hebrews the
[49:45] 10th chapter. And before we read, I
[49:49] would like to have prayer. Thank you
[49:51] musicians.
[49:54] Let's just bow in prayer.
[49:57] Father, we come in humbly
[50:02] realizing that the efforts of man uh can
[50:05] accomplish nothing for the kingdom of
[50:08] God. We just surrender ourselves
[50:11] &gt;&gt; and we we pray that somehow we will be
[50:14] able to by the Holy Ghost to say
[50:17] something of value, something, oh God,
[50:20] of eternal value, something that will be
[50:24] food for the sheep and deliverance for
[50:27] those that may be bound. There may be
[50:30] someone here yet not knowing you as
[50:32] their savior. Oh, blessed, lovely Lord
[50:36] Jesus. How can anyone go through this
[50:38] life without knowing you? This is a
[50:41] mystery. So I pray, Father, you will
[50:44] achieve and of any that you have chosen
[50:48] and are elected and predestinated
[50:51] to the gospel of Jesus Christ. May it
[50:54] come through today loud and clear. And
[50:57] may they, oh God, receive you. I pray,
[51:01] oh Lord Jesus, that you'll receive us as
[51:04] we just submit ourselves to you. We pray
[51:07] that you will bless the congregation
[51:09] that have come, each one every place
[51:12] they may be in the bride of Jesus Christ
[51:14] throughout the world. We ask in Jesus
[51:17] name for your glory. Amen.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read from Hebrews the 10th
[51:25] chapter and usually I start just at the
[51:28] fifth verse, but I would like to start
[51:30] at the first verse of the 10th chapter.
[51:33] And we'll read
[51:36] for the law having a shadow of good
[51:39] things to come and not the very image of
[51:43] the things
[51:44] can never with those sacrifices
[51:48] which they offered year by year
[51:51] continually make the comers there unto
[51:54] perfect.
[51:56] I would like to just emphasize
[51:58] can never
[52:01] &gt;&gt; can never
[52:04] &gt;&gt; can never
[52:05] &gt;&gt; because it was the works of man and the
[52:07] efforts of man and the resources of man
[52:10] and the slaying of animals can never
[52:15] &gt;&gt; with those sacrifices which they offered
[52:18] year by year continually make the comers
[52:21] there unto perfect. And he a he answers
[52:24] why in a moment. For then would they not
[52:27] have ceased to be offered because that
[52:31] the worshippers once purged should have
[52:35] no more conscience of sins.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; But in should have no more conscience of
[52:40] sins. That's the objective.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Every year you're reminded you're a
[52:44] sinner.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; That wasn't pleasing to God. And so he
[52:51] said they should have no more conscience
[52:53] of sin. But in those sacrifices there is
[52:57] a remembrance again made of sins every
[53:01] year.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; For it is not possible that the blood of
[53:06] bulls and goats should take away sins.
[53:09] Take away sins.
[53:12] Wherefore when he cometh into the world,
[53:15] when Jesus that is, when he cometh into
[53:17] the world, he saith, sacrifice and
[53:21] offering thou wouldst not, but a body
[53:25] hast thou prepared me? All right. What
[53:27] kind of a body? Something that'll take
[53:30] away sin.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Something that will remove the
[53:33] conscience,
[53:34] &gt;&gt; the guilt.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; This is amazing.
[53:38] And he said,
[53:40] "In burnt offerings and sacrifices for
[53:43] sin, thou which had no pleasure." Then
[53:47] said I, Lo, I come in the volume of the
[53:51] book, it is written of me to do thy
[53:54] will, oh God, above when he said,
[53:57] sacrifice and offering and burnt
[54:00] offerings and offerings for sin, thou
[54:02] wouldst not, neither hast pleasure
[54:06] therein, which are offered by the law.
[54:10] Then said he, "Lo, I come to do thy
[54:14] will, oh God. He taketh away the first,
[54:17] that he may establish the second."
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; And now I read an extra verse there. All
[54:25] right. God bless you as you have your
[54:27] seats.
[54:32] Now, I know I have used this title
[54:36] perhaps even here before.
[54:39] But I just want to be very open with the
[54:42] congregation.
[54:44] Uh I have been sometimes the Lord really
[54:49] causes a person to
[54:52] grind out
[54:54] in their heart and in their soul and in
[54:57] the depth of their spiritual
[54:59] understanding. I have something I want
[55:01] to convey to you. So you need to it'll
[55:05] be more like a study but I'd like you to
[55:08] follow very very closely. We have quite
[55:10] a bit of reading and I have it on the
[55:12] screen for you as well because uh I
[55:16] would have to go to so many places in
[55:17] the scripture. Brother Brandham
[55:19] condensed it marvelously in the message
[55:23] the invisible union of the bride of
[55:25] Jesus Christ. And I I want you to be
[55:28] able to read it yourself because it will
[55:30] have a greater impact and it'll be
[55:32] necessary. But some things for a
[55:35] background first uh he said low I come
[55:39] in the volume of the book I want to
[55:43] describe to you and suggest to you that
[55:46] each one of you are actually
[55:50] a a book within itself. It is not only
[55:53] that your name is in a book, but your
[55:57] name is representative of your life.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; You are a book. We can say the pages of
[56:03] the book perhaps are the days of our
[56:06] life we're living it. Uh uh or the
[56:10] chapters we say, well, I'm I'm in a new
[56:13] chapter of life. Sometimes it might be
[56:17] uh you know uh a season or a year or it
[56:20] might be a season of of life. And now
[56:23] I'm in another chapter of my life. Uh
[56:27] the this book is a lot of words. We call
[56:32] it the Bible, the word of God. And it's
[56:35] a a lot of words on paper. Uh
[56:41] and if if it just remains there
[56:46] as a word or as verses
[56:49] &gt;&gt; or as promises
[56:51] or as commandments, if it just remains
[56:54] there, uh that's all it is is a dead
[56:58] letter
[57:00] &gt;&gt; until until it becomes lived out by
[57:03] someone. then it becomes a living force
[57:07] because now we see visibly what that
[57:11] says. Amen.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; But now if there's a if it's a promise,
[57:16] &gt;&gt; then if the unseen God
[57:19] &gt;&gt; who made the promise actually
[57:22] fulfills it
[57:24] &gt;&gt; in a person's life or within the age or
[57:28] a time of life or prophesies things that
[57:32] might be of a global scale and it
[57:34] happens and there were prophecies and
[57:37] and promises towards Israel as a people
[57:41] and there are promises towards you
[57:43] sitting here today. There are promises
[57:46] but they might they'll just be dead
[57:48] letter unless someone is effective with
[57:51] their faith and believes it.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Says I I believe that.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; So that's kind of where we're where
[57:58] we're going just a wee bit.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says now a body hast
[58:06] thou prepared me? this word prepared.
[58:10] It's uh I I thought what kind of a body?
[58:13] So I began to look at that what kind of
[58:15] a body all these thousands and thousands
[58:19] of animals that were slain and you
[58:23] almost uh to the human mind and I have
[58:26] to be honest I have often marveled how
[58:30] how is God the creator of heavens and
[58:33] earth what what satisfaction does he get
[58:36] that there's slaying beasts and bulls
[58:40] and sheep and goats son animals by the
[58:45] thousands is an incredible thing. And
[58:48] yet somehow that was uh describing the
[58:54] awfulness of sin. It was also describing
[58:59] that there had to be bloodshed. It was
[59:02] an incredible cost, incredible thing.
[59:05] But the people slew animals by the
[59:08] thousands. Now we have a scripture
[59:11] apostle Paul writing and saying thou
[59:13] hast had no pleasure in that
[59:16] &gt;&gt; that didn't satisfy the penalty
[59:18] &gt;&gt; right
[59:19] &gt;&gt; and that had to be done every year and
[59:21] one of the big things is God did not
[59:24] want his children to be reminded every
[59:29] year
[59:30] &gt;&gt; they're sinners
[59:32] &gt;&gt; he wanted to do away with sin there had
[59:35] to be something more effective more
[59:38] powerful, more glorious
[59:41] &gt;&gt; than that.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; And and that uh now comes the son of
[59:46] God, Jesus Christ himself, who was the
[59:50] word made flesh, virgin born.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Didn't come through human effort.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Didn't come, listen close now, didn't
[59:59] come by man or woman's effort,
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; but came as a virgin birth. Yes. uh Mary
[1:00:07] had to bear him and and she gave birth
[1:00:10] to him and he died he was born as a man
[1:00:13] and died as a man but it was God in the
[1:00:16] flesh.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; You agree with that?
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; And so to be prepared now I got thinking
[1:00:22] of the body.
[1:00:24] Uh now the prophet said that God was in
[1:00:28] Moses,
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; God was in Abraham.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; God was in these saints.
[1:00:36] Now I'm I'm you you you might not
[1:00:38] understand me till I get to the end of
[1:00:40] the service. So hang on to this. Now I
[1:00:43] thought, well, Abraham back there, he
[1:00:46] actually lied.
[1:00:49] And the prophet said he backslid. He
[1:00:51] went into another country, which he
[1:00:53] shouldn't have done, and he lied about
[1:00:55] his wife. And here you've got him be
[1:01:00] contributing to a body,
[1:01:03] a sinless body.
[1:01:05] But they actually did. Then you have
[1:01:08] Moses who slew
[1:01:11] uh murdered an a an Egyptian and buried
[1:01:14] him in the sand as and and he's he's uh
[1:01:18] acting out a redeemer of Christ
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; and he and Christ was in him.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:01:27] So now you have you have something
[1:01:30] happening here that's very very
[1:01:32] important in order to understand grace.
[1:01:35] Now if I'm losing you don't don't don't
[1:01:37] don't let don't don't let go now. Don't
[1:01:40] shut off your mind.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Now you've got people that actually uh
[1:01:46] did error. Uh they eroded they sinned.
[1:01:51] They did wrong. David and others, men
[1:01:55] and women. Rahab was a harlot, but she
[1:01:59] was in the motherhood of Christ. And you
[1:02:02] have these others that were certainly
[1:02:05] deficient in a lot of ways. But now on
[1:02:08] that side of the in the Old Testament,
[1:02:10] you have in this side, you have these,
[1:02:15] and we're talking about the body hast
[1:02:17] thou prepared me? We're talking about
[1:02:19] the sinless
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; lamb of God.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; So somehow somehow
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; God had God had in his mind that he's
[1:02:30] going to deal with these things
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; or this God had the ability to
[1:02:37] obliterate and do away and wash away and
[1:02:41] loose sin from people. And I'll tell you
[1:02:45] it I'll just give you the key word. It's
[1:02:48] election.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; It's election.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; If God elects someone to be his son,
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; that's it.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; That's touch for me. That's that's the
[1:03:00] end of it.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; And God is the only one that can have a
[1:03:05] sea of forgetfulness.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; You have a memory. I have a memory.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; And unfortunately, Satan has access to
[1:03:13] that. And we can remember our wrongs
[1:03:16] every day or every year. And that that
[1:03:19] by remembering them is not pleasing to
[1:03:22] God. And it's belittling of Calvary.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Calvary actually
[1:03:29] annihilated sin.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Calvary dealt a blow to Satan and sin.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; And at Calvary, he crushed the serpent's
[1:03:39] head.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:43] Amen.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; And we're going to come to the new side,
[1:03:51] the New Testament. The bridegroom
[1:03:53] fulfills the old and the bride fulfills
[1:03:56] the new.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; We're going to come to the New
[1:03:58] Testament. And here are you and I with
[1:04:01] our weaknesses and our frailties and our
[1:04:05] memories of our past and all these
[1:04:07] things. What what does this uh I'm going
[1:04:10] to be very very honest with you.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Does this make up a part of a spotless
[1:04:15] bride? Yes, it does.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; It happens to make up a part of a
[1:04:19] spotless bride. And we have things
[1:04:21] inbuilt in our character and in our
[1:04:24] nature
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; and our our problem is one of our big
[1:04:28] problems. Now I'm going to come right
[1:04:30] into your address
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; is the nature that came to you by your
[1:04:36] natural birth. Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; And many of the problems that people
[1:04:41] suffer today or are uh they are dealing
[1:04:45] with today are are of of our natural
[1:04:49] nature
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; where well I was kind of born that way.
[1:04:53] Uh I was born with uh you know a certain
[1:04:56] gift or certain talents or whatever more
[1:04:58] and we were born to where we would we
[1:05:02] could remember things and it's a
[1:05:04] problem.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; It's a problem. And then uh I find
[1:05:09] things today I've done a lot of
[1:05:10] counseling and the brothers behind me
[1:05:12] have done a lot of counseling. A lot of
[1:05:15] our counseling is from uh
[1:05:19] it it comes from I'm just want to be
[1:05:21] careful with my words but it comes from
[1:05:23] we could say natural life but it also
[1:05:26] comes from human nature and human
[1:05:28] character
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; and that needs to be dealt with
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; in the light of the scripture.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. in the light of the scripture in
[1:05:36] the and a lot of the ailments today are
[1:05:38] because people are have not got a full
[1:05:42] grasp of the grace of God.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; In fact is I find things in the life and
[1:05:52] ministry of William Brandham where the
[1:05:55] grace is so great
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; and he does things and I I have to
[1:06:00] confess I'm not there yet. I just can't
[1:06:04] do that. I I can't I can't uh uh just
[1:06:08] forgive the things that are do you know
[1:06:11] he was said you know that this is being
[1:06:13] said about you ah he said you know
[1:06:17] that's just a a predestinated problem
[1:06:20] that's just a predestinated I haven't I
[1:06:23] haven't come there many times I
[1:06:25] sometimes I have that an abundant part
[1:06:28] of grace and then other times I think
[1:06:30] well I I if I he were around here I
[1:06:33] would tell him a thing or two.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, you've never felt that way, have
[1:06:38] you?
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you have.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; You know how I know you have. I don't
[1:06:44] care where you're from. I don't care
[1:06:46] what what your background is. I don't
[1:06:49] care where you were born. I don't care
[1:06:51] who your parents were. But God has
[1:06:53] directed me. And I have wrestled with
[1:06:55] this message for about a month or a
[1:06:58] month and a half. And I know it's for a
[1:07:00] people. And uh I touched on it in
[1:07:03] Edmonton and I touched on it over in
[1:07:06] Germany, but then when I was done uh it
[1:07:09] says it's for home.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; It's for home.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; And so I thought, well, that's good
[1:07:16] because then I'll be home and I can just
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; say it.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:23] and you that are visiting, you can just
[1:07:25] tuck it away someplace and you'll pull
[1:07:28] it out in a few days or a month or so
[1:07:31] and say, you know, that that's uh yeah,
[1:07:34] he touched on some things. All right.
[1:07:38] Incidentally, while we were in while
[1:07:40] we're in Germany,
[1:07:42] you young men that are here,
[1:07:45] uh
[1:07:47] the meetings were all over, 14 of them.
[1:07:52] And in one week, and I went to church 10
[1:07:55] times and preached three of them. So,
[1:07:58] I've we we had a fairly heavy schedule.
[1:08:02] And uh I didn't see this young man, very
[1:08:05] very fine young man, handsome uh young
[1:08:08] man from Nigeria.
[1:08:10] And uh uh we got driven out to
[1:08:14] Stoutgart. Now everybody's breaking up
[1:08:16] going every which direction and so
[1:08:18] forth. And I was talking to someone in
[1:08:21] the hotel. Now we're booked into the
[1:08:22] hotel in night and uh other people were
[1:08:26] also booked in. and my my I think Linda,
[1:08:30] she's uh motioning to me to come and uh
[1:08:35] this this young man would like to ask
[1:08:37] you a question. I said, "Oh my goodness.
[1:08:39] Uh I don't want to answer. I don't want
[1:08:42] to get engaged in any conversation."
[1:08:44] Well, they said he he'd like to talk to
[1:08:46] you. I said, "Okay."
[1:08:48] cuz he was sitting over at the table by
[1:08:50] himself. But his mother and father were
[1:08:52] there, but they were his father's a
[1:08:55] businessman and his father and mother
[1:08:57] sat right in front of sister Ruth and I
[1:08:59] the whole week.
[1:09:01] So I felt as though I knew him. And one
[1:09:03] day in fact is I felt like I wanted to
[1:09:05] lay my hands on the man and he was very
[1:09:08] very fine man. So, uh,
[1:09:13] I went over and
[1:09:15] this young man, 19, no, he's 23, I'm
[1:09:19] sorry, he's 23.
[1:09:21] And he says, uh, you made a statement in
[1:09:25] the service you spoke Tuesday night.
[1:09:28] Now, now, this is Sunday night.
[1:09:31] And he's he's been in about 14 meetings,
[1:09:35] and I spoke the second night. He says,
[1:09:38] "You made a statement
[1:09:40] on Tuesday night."
[1:09:43] And he said, "You said
[1:09:45] you you said a self-imposed sacrifice."
[1:09:51] He said, "What is that?"
[1:09:57] I knew that this was a unusual young
[1:09:59] man.
[1:10:00] And I said, 'Well,
[1:10:03] I said, 'It's something that maybe you
[1:10:05] want to do and God wants you to
[1:10:08] sacrifice it.
[1:10:10] He kind of put his head back and
[1:10:12] laughed. I said, "Am I coming home? Am I
[1:10:15] coming to the point?" And his mother was
[1:10:18] sitting beside him. And he said, she
[1:10:20] said, nodded, "Yeah, here's to the
[1:10:22] point." She said, he said, "I have a lot
[1:10:25] of options, a lot of opportunities." The
[1:10:28] reason why he has a lot of
[1:10:30] opportunities, I have his dad's card in
[1:10:33] my pocket here
[1:10:36] and his dad is
[1:10:39] authorized importer
[1:10:42] of BMW automobiles,
[1:10:47] Rover Land Rover automobiles for
[1:10:50] Nigeria.
[1:10:52] He's got a huge business and his dad is
[1:10:54] CEO and president of this company
[1:10:59] for Lagos
[1:11:01] for Nigeria.
[1:11:03] And I said obviously you have a lot of
[1:11:06] opportunities. Yeah. I said I do but I'd
[1:11:09] like to study this. I'd like to study
[1:11:12] and go in this direction. I said well
[1:11:14] maybe God wants you to sacrifice that.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Maybe that's why you asked this
[1:11:19] question. and he just put his head back
[1:11:21] and roared because I I I said I think
[1:11:24] I'm hitting the nail on the head. And he
[1:11:26] just put his head back and roared again.
[1:11:29] But I was impressed that somebody said,
[1:11:31] you know, they they've held that in
[1:11:33] their heart,
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; just a few words for the whole week.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; What do you mean by that? Well, maybe
[1:11:40] I'm coming to your address. You you'll
[1:11:43] be hearing some things. You'll say,
[1:11:44] "What do you mean by that?" I want you
[1:11:46] to listen very very close because you
[1:11:49] will know a lot clearer towards the end
[1:11:52] of the end of the service. And so uh to
[1:11:56] be th this body that was prepared. The
[1:12:00] word prepared is this comes from about
[1:12:04] four associated words and it is
[1:12:09] to perfect or to complete one
[1:12:14] make one what they ought to be
[1:12:20] a body. Now I want you to think of
[1:12:22] yourself. A body has the Lord God
[1:12:27] prepared for me. He wants to anything
[1:12:31] that God will bring to you, he wants to
[1:12:33] make you what you ought to be.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; That's number one.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Number two,
[1:12:40] having special attributes or special
[1:12:43] aptitude for given uses. In other words,
[1:12:47] you have been given a purpose in life
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; and God gives you divine and specific
[1:12:55] aptitude for that purpose.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; That is part of the preparation.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; If you go back Moses or the prophets or
[1:13:07] whatever more, brother Brandham talks
[1:13:09] about them being rugged men. And they
[1:13:11] had an aptitude to be that
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; because the message they were had to
[1:13:16] bring had to had to be delivered that
[1:13:19] way.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; And so they were a certain way. Now all
[1:13:23] of you that are here this morning,
[1:13:26] you've all had a different background
[1:13:28] and a different upbringing. And maybe
[1:13:31] you have had you have good reason to
[1:13:34] complain about that. But on the other
[1:13:36] hand, and those of you that have perhaps
[1:13:39] immigrated from other countries and some
[1:13:41] have had very uh difficult backgrounds,
[1:13:48] is that not so?
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; You don't want to hear about mine, but I
[1:13:53] was shifted all over the country. in
[1:13:56] fact is I've just said and I'm not going
[1:13:58] to dwell on it at all, but I've just
[1:14:00] said because of my own family and
[1:14:02] children and so on and and and some of
[1:14:05] my family were talking about where we're
[1:14:06] getting the rooms fixed for, you know,
[1:14:09] the girls or something or getting for
[1:14:11] the family for the children and I
[1:14:13] thought uh I tried to remember when I
[1:14:16] had a room.
[1:14:19] I have never
[1:14:22] in my youth and my teens never had a
[1:14:26] room of my own. Never had a room. And so
[1:14:31] then I thought about that and just had a
[1:14:33] a a sense of remorse for just a moment.
[1:14:36] And I thought, no, that was all part of
[1:14:38] the preparation because when I started
[1:14:40] going overseas and mission work, they'd
[1:14:43] say, "Well, this is where you're going
[1:14:44] to stay." And sometime they'd apologize
[1:14:46] and say, "Well, I'm sorry. we don't have
[1:14:48] anything else. You know, I that's just
[1:14:50] fine. In fact, there's one place in
[1:14:52] India they they had just like one piece
[1:14:55] of cloth on a on a bunch of boards and
[1:14:57] they said uh and he was very apologetic.
[1:15:00] He said I I I wish we had something
[1:15:03] more, but he said, "I only have this
[1:15:05] piece of cloth and you can either sleep
[1:15:07] on top of it or sleep under it were his
[1:15:10] exact words." And I said, "No, it'll be
[1:15:12] fine. I'll I'll figure out." And uh Jeff
[1:15:15] Jenkins was in another place and he had
[1:15:18] a little pad and I saw him as I walked
[1:15:22] by I'd see they were in another he and
[1:15:24] his dad were in another room. They had a
[1:15:26] little pad. He had a little pad and one
[1:15:28] day I just thought he's not preaching.
[1:15:33] I just took a hold of that pad and said
[1:15:36] I'm going to use this.
[1:15:40] [Laughter]
[1:15:42] Is it all right?
[1:15:46] So, we don't know what you know
[1:15:48] something you might be in the middle of
[1:15:50] and uh complaining and grumbling about
[1:15:52] it. It may be just that it's the work of
[1:15:55] God in your life preparing you to to be
[1:15:58] preparing the body for you. Amen.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; I had a real good friend uh a native
[1:16:07] Indian man down from California and and
[1:16:10] he he knew all about how trees should be
[1:16:15] pruned and everything every and he was
[1:16:17] asked to pick apples in this orchard.
[1:16:21] And so he was picking apples and the man
[1:16:23] had not looked after it. He said he told
[1:16:25] me he said the man didn't even deserve
[1:16:27] to have an orchard. branches going
[1:16:30] everywhere. And he said, "I was
[1:16:32] complaining all afternoon. I was picking
[1:16:34] these apples. Had this big sack and he
[1:16:37] said, I was picking these apples. I was
[1:16:38] right at the top of the ladder." And he
[1:16:40] said, "And there was one big beautiful
[1:16:42] apple and I just need to reach and get
[1:16:44] that apple." And he said, "And I I
[1:16:47] reached out for that apple." And he
[1:16:49] says, "And the the ladder kicked out and
[1:16:53] I fell." He said, "It was the branches
[1:16:56] that I complained about all day that
[1:16:58] saved me."
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; What a lesson.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the very thing that we're
[1:17:06] complaining about is the thing that God
[1:17:08] is, you know, is preparing our body,
[1:17:11] preparing this life for whatever he has
[1:17:15] in store for us.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; And so that is giving special aptitude
[1:17:19] for certain given uses. And then listen,
[1:17:22] this is a big one and it blessed me very
[1:17:24] much. I'm just in the very opening
[1:17:26] statements of my message, but it it is
[1:17:30] it comes from in preparation.
[1:17:33] You came into this world at a certain
[1:17:37] time.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; You were born at a certain time. You
[1:17:41] were at a certain age at this time. But
[1:17:44] God in his mind, he's sending his word
[1:17:48] saying knowing what he's going to reveal
[1:17:50] and knowing that certain people have to
[1:17:54] be there. And so the word is now.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; It's now, this moment
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; precisely for this time. God is not
[1:18:05] wasting his effort and sending his
[1:18:08] spirit and revealing things that are in
[1:18:11] the word of God. And this word of God
[1:18:13] certainly needs to be revealed.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; And he's not he's not doing that idly.
[1:18:19] It is for certain people and I come back
[1:18:22] to election elected for that time given
[1:18:26] certain aptitude, certain skills,
[1:18:29] certain abilities and certain passion
[1:18:32] within them. And that's what I picked up
[1:18:34] out of brother John Andy's on on
[1:18:36] Wednesday night. He thought it was a
[1:18:38] short message. Perhaps he didn't have
[1:18:40] the time, but it was just it was just
[1:18:43] absolutely precise
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; because he conveyed his passion.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; And brother Ron Spencer, while we're
[1:18:52] away, he up in Edmonton, he said, "I
[1:18:54] like people with passion." He said,
[1:18:57] "That's why I like brother I like
[1:18:58] brother Tom Ray's preaching." He said,
[1:19:00] "Because he's passionate. He takes a
[1:19:03] hold of a scripture. He takes a hold of
[1:19:05] a statement." He said in a few moments
[1:19:08] he's just screaming that out. He said I
[1:19:10] love that. He said it tells me that a
[1:19:13] person is passionate. You don't want
[1:19:15] somebody just dribbling along with you
[1:19:18] know I have a testimony. Oh for go and
[1:19:20] tell the fox.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus said
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; you want to be passionate.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; I'm saved.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; I'm redeemed.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; I'm full of the Holy Ghost. Thank you
[1:19:33] young people for singing. Amen.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I feel like shouting hallelujah.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; A person can't be passionate. Then you
[1:19:46] got the wrong religion.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; I'm passionate about this message.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Other people need to hear it.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; If it's in not in their language, we
[1:19:55] need to get it in their language. We
[1:19:57] need to find them and hunt them out
[1:19:59] because we're looking for the last seed.
[1:20:01] And somebody is the last seed.
[1:20:04] Glory to God.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; You better start praying or I'm not
[1:20:08] going to get done.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; And the last word that comprises
[1:20:15] he's a prepared a body is to take it up,
[1:20:20] to elevate it, and to carry it away.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what happened with the
[1:20:27] body of Jesus Christ. He was lifted up
[1:20:30] above the people and he was carried away
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; and a cloud received him and the people
[1:20:38] were gazing said he'll come in like
[1:20:40] manner. Ah I just say praise be to God
[1:20:44] and he has sent a message to put you
[1:20:47] into heavenly places so that you are
[1:20:50] your mind you might say well I I I don't
[1:20:54] want to be so heavenly minded I'm no
[1:20:55] earthly good. That's exactly what I
[1:20:57] want.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; That you'll get so heavenly minded that
[1:21:01] this world and this Satan's Eden doesn't
[1:21:04] mean anything to you. I'm not living for
[1:21:06] this world. I'm not interested in this
[1:21:09] world. We're not interested in the
[1:21:11] finance or or the politics or all of
[1:21:14] these things because it's not going to
[1:21:16] get better, friends.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Not going to get better.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so you might say, "I
[1:21:25] have a lot of problem. I have a lot of
[1:21:27] problem with my education. I have a lot
[1:21:29] of problem with the finance. I have a
[1:21:30] lot of problem." Well, that's good.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Our heavenly father's not sitting there.
[1:21:39] Well, I didn't know that.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; He's not being taken by surprise.
[1:21:46] Hallelujah.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; There's much. You've probably heard me
[1:21:51] say this, but there's much in the volume
[1:21:54] of the book.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Lo, I come not just in the book, but I
[1:21:58] come in the volume of the book. All of
[1:22:00] it.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; The good part,
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; the bad part,
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; the easy part,
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; the difficult part.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't like to hear that, but I'm
[1:22:10] going to tell you the difficult part.
[1:22:12] When they when they ate the Passover
[1:22:13] lamb, they said to eat all of it
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; and the bad part, the difficult part,
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; you know, it's it's one thing to say we
[1:22:27] will have difficult parts. There's
[1:22:30] difficult parts in the book. There's
[1:22:33] things that take place or things that we
[1:22:36] are required to go through and we don't
[1:22:40] like. But I'll say this that whatever
[1:22:42] God wants us to forget, you won't
[1:22:44] remember it anymore.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Well, there's a few that believe that
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; throughout the Old Testament, God built
[1:22:54] his masterpiece expressly for the
[1:22:57] sacrifice of sin. The full and complete
[1:23:01] penalty was paid when Jesus hung his
[1:23:04] head and said, "It is finished." that I
[1:23:08] I want you to try to grasp this this
[1:23:11] morning. Something I've been pondering.
[1:23:14] It is finished.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Anything that Lucifer attempted to do
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; has been resolved.
[1:23:24] any person he's determined to destroy
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; of the elected of God,
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; his his plan will not be deterred
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; and it will not be afflicted.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Now the scripture says and Jesus spoke
[1:23:41] it. I have it later on. He said if we
[1:23:44] come to it he said in this in the world
[1:23:48] you will have tribulation
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; but be of good courage.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; I have overcome the world.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Be at peace
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; in the world.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; You shall have tribulation.
[1:24:03] That's not pleasant. That's not easy. I
[1:24:05] don't want to major on that. But I this
[1:24:09] message did not come to give us a bunch
[1:24:12] of uh weaklings
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; or you know true
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; people that are just unable to handle it
[1:24:20] and just kind of wimp and you know what
[1:24:23] I mean that's not what the message came
[1:24:25] to produce at all.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach it straight going to
[1:24:29] preach it hard.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; The message actually came to preach to
[1:24:33] bring forth real solid people. Amen.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Now, you young ladies that are, you
[1:24:39] know, maybe concerned about your life
[1:24:41] and your future and how you look and who
[1:24:44] you're going to marry and all the rest
[1:24:45] of it, I say set your sights on eternal
[1:24:49] things on God and let him bring back
[1:24:53] whoever he wishes.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of you people don't believe
[1:24:59] that, but I say that's absolutely the
[1:25:01] truth. Absolutely the truth
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; because I find that when people take
[1:25:05] things into their own hands, they mess
[1:25:08] it up.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; And then when they mess it up, they want
[1:25:11] a preacher to resolve everything. I say,
[1:25:14] "You need to fix it yourself."
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; I said to brother Dioa, "How do you how
[1:25:19] do you counsel all these people? I'm so
[1:25:22] involved in counseling." And he I said,
[1:25:25] "You've got 10 12,000 people in your
[1:25:27] church. How do you counsel these
[1:25:29] people?" He said, "I just tell them to
[1:25:31] go home and pray."
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Thought, boy, that is good.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; That's a good solution. Go home and
[1:25:37] pray.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; What is a book? Well, a book is you
[1:25:48] could look up on if you want to. It's
[1:25:51] just made up of p of pages and chapters.
[1:25:55] It could be blank pages. It might be
[1:25:57] printed pages. And uh sometimes the
[1:26:01] chapter might refer to as I said a
[1:26:03] moment ago a season of our lives. Uh
[1:26:07] your life becomes visible in a written
[1:26:10] book. Now this is what God said. Are you
[1:26:13] still listening?
[1:26:16] And Moses gathered all the congregation
[1:26:18] because God told him to, of the children
[1:26:21] of Israel together, and said unto them,
[1:26:24] "These are the words which the Lord hath
[1:26:27] commanded
[1:26:29] that thou do them."
[1:26:32] Why was that? Well, because if they
[1:26:34] didn't do them, none of the other
[1:26:37] people, none of the other nations would
[1:26:39] know what God commanded.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; So God commanded it and the people did
[1:26:43] it. And then the people who didn't know
[1:26:45] anything about this God say, "Oh, that's
[1:26:48] what it was."
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; God sends a message.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; And I guess I'll have to say this is as
[1:26:58] clear as possible. He sends a message.
[1:27:01] And I noticed that in the Old Testament,
[1:27:05] God would call and speak through his
[1:27:08] prophets and tell them what was going to
[1:27:12] be. and come against the things that
[1:27:16] they were doing that was going to bring
[1:27:19] the judgment on down.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; So they'd come crying against the way
[1:27:25] the people were. Sometimes they were
[1:27:26] burning incense to other gods and God
[1:27:29] doesn't do anything. They're burning
[1:27:31] incense to other gods. They're
[1:27:33] worshiping other gods and God doesn't do
[1:27:35] anything. But he had already given them
[1:27:38] a word. And Arie had prophets that were
[1:27:40] screaming out against what the people
[1:27:42] were doing. And that's why they were
[1:27:45] that's why they killed the prophets.
[1:27:47] They killed them because they didn't
[1:27:48] like them. They weren't popular.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said when he was there because
[1:27:53] he was speaking about things that was
[1:27:56] going to happen if you don't change. If
[1:27:58] you don't do something about this, it's
[1:28:02] not going to go well with you. And he
[1:28:04] would tell he would tell Israel, "If you
[1:28:06] don't, I'll you know you'll go into
[1:28:08] bondage." And so he had these people
[1:28:10] there. And they were not popular.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; They were not popular.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to this congregation,
[1:28:17] if you're sitting here waiting till the
[1:28:19] message gets popular, you're missing the
[1:28:22] boat.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; You might as well say, "Amen."
[1:28:31] This message did not come to become
[1:28:34] popular.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; And if it becomes popular, it's not the
[1:28:37] message.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; I had a woman, she was the reporter
[1:28:48] from the ecumenical newspaper,
[1:28:52] and I guess you know what that is.
[1:28:55] And it's a widpread newspaper throughout
[1:28:58] the area.
[1:29:00] and she said, "I'd like to uh I'd like
[1:29:04] to interview you." I said, "Okay."
[1:29:08] So, she came by
[1:29:10] and we sat down. I said, "Well, now I
[1:29:13] will
[1:29:14] uh if if you
[1:29:16] report any of this, if you print any of
[1:29:18] this in your paper,
[1:29:20] you need to print it in its entirety.
[1:29:24] I don't want you to pick and choose just
[1:29:26] and slant certain words.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, one of her questions was, and
[1:29:33] I hadn't had intended to say this, but I
[1:29:35] will. Uh, do you, and she was having
[1:29:39] difficulty. She was trying to be very
[1:29:40] diplomatic, and she said, "Do you ever
[1:29:45] think or consider that this might be a
[1:29:48] cult?" I said, "Oh, yeah. I I think of
[1:29:50] it." said, "Well, do you know what a
[1:29:54] cult is?" I said, 'Well,
[1:29:57] I I've read a little bit about it, but
[1:29:59] not much because I I don't have time for
[1:30:01] reading a bunch of other people's books.
[1:30:04] And she said, "Okay." I said, "But I
[1:30:07] said,
[1:30:09] "Do you know what a cult is?" I said,
[1:30:11] "What I have read about it is that a
[1:30:13] cult usually has a man as the head of
[1:30:18] it." said, "That's exactly right."
[1:30:21] And I said, "A cult usually considers
[1:30:23] that that man's words are to be kept.
[1:30:28] That's the absolute like an absolute."
[1:30:30] She said, "That's right."
[1:30:33] I said, "And a cult usually winds up
[1:30:37] being very few."
[1:30:40] She said, "That's right. That's right."
[1:30:42] And she was surprised that I could even
[1:30:43] give her some right answers.
[1:30:46] I said, "It sounds very much like Jesus
[1:30:48] and his disciples."
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; And she was stunned.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; She didn't know what to say. She said,
[1:30:57] and her eyes went wide. She says,
[1:30:59] "You're right."
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; And if I said it had been any other way,
[1:31:05] it wouldn't have been Jesus.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; I said it happened the same. It was the
[1:31:10] same with the disciples and it was the
[1:31:13] same with the all the messengers. It was
[1:31:16] the same with Luther. I said Luther was
[1:31:19] hunted hunted down all over Europe.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; I said and Wesley would stand on a chair
[1:31:27] or something and preach to a few
[1:31:29] thousand and they would even try to get
[1:31:31] a certain bank that would uh reverberate
[1:31:34] his voice so he could speak to all those
[1:31:36] thousands. And I said, "And a woman, a
[1:31:39] very, very powerful woman, stood up in
[1:31:41] the government of England and wanted the
[1:31:44] government to ban him from every pulpit
[1:31:47] in the entire nation, including his own
[1:31:50] father-in-law or his grandfather's
[1:31:53] pulpit." I said, "Was he popular?" "No."
[1:31:57] I said, "Yes." And if you mean that kind
[1:32:00] of a cult, I guess we are.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; And you know what she wanted to? She
[1:32:05] wanted me to baptize her, but she never
[1:32:07] came back.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; I would have baptized her.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; We have absolutely nothing to be ashamed
[1:32:16] of.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Do I have I' I've got to have a little
[1:32:29] more time. Amen.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; And so James and James said, "Be ye
[1:32:36] doers
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; of the word
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; and not hearers only." So we're not
[1:32:42] going to say, "I'm a I'm a message
[1:32:44] believer." Well, that's just words.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; I I want to say something that is acting
[1:32:49] it out,
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; doing it, then I want to say it.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham says, "I want to
[1:32:58] read some scripture, and it's just one
[1:33:01] verse, and I want to I want I want you
[1:33:03] to read it with me." And it's
[1:33:05] Deuteronomy 4:1
[1:33:08] and to this church, he said, "And to the
[1:33:10] tapes and people on tapes and people on
[1:33:14] the hookup across other parts of the
[1:33:17] nation, I want you to listen to this
[1:33:20] real close. And don't you fail. This is
[1:33:24] the thing that Deuteronomy 4 chapter I
[1:33:29] I'm going to get the first verse and I
[1:33:32] want to read the first verse. Here's the
[1:33:35] verse. Now therefore, hearken, O Israel,
[1:33:39] unto the statutes and to the judgments
[1:33:43] which I teach you, for to do them,
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; that you may live
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; and go in and possess the land which the
[1:33:53] Lord God of your fathers giveth you.
[1:33:56] Amen.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm going slowly with that because
[1:34:00] to to receive the benefit it was that
[1:34:04] you take these statutes and these
[1:34:06] judgments and these things that God was
[1:34:08] and do them.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; And you know here we have a messenger
[1:34:12] all down this time.
[1:34:14] I'm going to be very very honest with
[1:34:16] you and very open. I'm I'm amazed at
[1:34:21] uh
[1:34:23] the number of people and you young
[1:34:25] people,
[1:34:28] you want to get a hold of the message
[1:34:31] and you want to ponder it and you want
[1:34:34] to just I will just tell you this as
[1:34:37] your friend, as your brother, as a
[1:34:40] minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[1:34:42] you need to know what it says
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; and you need to do it not as a law, not
[1:34:49] as a bunch of dos and don'ts,
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; but when the Bible talks about uh the
[1:34:56] kind of life you live,
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; I I know a lot of people that dress
[1:35:00] right, but we have to do right.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; It's not just dressing right.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; It's not just acting right. It's doing
[1:35:09] the things.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for this congregation. I'm
[1:35:16] thankful you love the word of God.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; I know you've had all kinds of reversals
[1:35:21] and you've had all kinds of things and
[1:35:23] that's what I'm dealing with right
[1:35:25] today.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; All kinds of things that have taken
[1:35:28] place in every person's life and there
[1:35:31] are bitter pills to swallow.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you the cross of
[1:35:38] Jesus Christ
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; has literally obliterated, if I could
[1:35:42] get another word, annihilated.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. and taken the things that Satan
[1:35:47] has brought upon your life, your past,
[1:35:51] your direction, even to the death of
[1:35:54] people.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Many of us have had someone that has
[1:35:59] passed away and we don't know about it.
[1:36:02] We prayed for them and and it didn't
[1:36:05] happen. They weren't healed. And yet, we
[1:36:07] have wonderful things that have taken
[1:36:10] place. Uh just recently the other night
[1:36:14] when I was in Germany, there was a
[1:36:16] pastor there. He's from uh West Africa
[1:36:21] and and uh he was of a certain influence
[1:36:26] and they were praying praying had a big
[1:36:29] prayer line and probably three 400
[1:36:32] people in the prayer line. They're
[1:36:34] praying for the people.
[1:36:37] Brother Ron Spencer gave testimony and
[1:36:40] he said I and I I would sooner have him
[1:36:43] here saying this but he said
[1:36:46] I do have visions
[1:36:49] and he said uh sometimes I have vision.
[1:36:54] Brother Tim Puit's daughter whose name
[1:36:56] is Bethany who has been up here. Some of
[1:36:59] you know may know of and I see sister
[1:37:02] Kathy you know about this and she had a
[1:37:06] baby and the baby had an affliction in
[1:37:10] the legs and couldn't walk
[1:37:12] and uh brother Ron Spencer said to her
[1:37:18] he said I've had a vision that that that
[1:37:22] child will walk. I saw it running.
[1:37:26] And then Sister Puit became afflicted
[1:37:29] just weeks ago and she was a had an
[1:37:32] affliction and God was touching her and
[1:37:36] things were going in a positive
[1:37:37] direction
[1:37:39] and uh but she got discouraged.
[1:37:42] Are you here?
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Things go bad for a while then things go
[1:37:47] good
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; and things go bad and she got
[1:37:51] discouraged.
[1:37:54] things were going absolutely sideways
[1:37:56] with her. And she had that child
[1:38:00] with her, I guess, on her lap. And that
[1:38:04] child, which had never walked and jumped
[1:38:08] off her lap and ran across the room and
[1:38:11] has been running ever since.
[1:38:14] and and this this little brother who was
[1:38:17] standing here at the after the service
[1:38:19] and listened to one testimony after
[1:38:22] another after another after another.
[1:38:24] Listen friends, it's not a bunch of
[1:38:26] words on a book. This is something that
[1:38:29] people become uh they become uh not only
[1:38:34] illuminated but their faith faith cometh
[1:38:37] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[1:38:40] God not by the denominational doctrine
[1:38:43] by the word of God.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Not by what someone's opinion is but by
[1:38:48] the word of God. And when the word of
[1:38:51] God and you hear it in its purity and
[1:38:53] there's something inside rises up says I
[1:38:56] believe that
[1:38:58] I believe that
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; all things are possible to them that
[1:39:04] believe. Thus sayith the word of God.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; And that child leaped off that and this
[1:39:12] brother was at the back and he was
[1:39:15] there's several hundreds of people there
[1:39:17] and he just standing there a very fine
[1:39:21] pastor and he's he just saying I don't
[1:39:23] know him well. He was just saying, he
[1:39:26] wasn't saying it to me. He was just
[1:39:28] saying it to himself or saying it to
[1:39:30] anybody. There was nobody around, but he
[1:39:32] was just saying amazing.
[1:39:35] Absolutely amazing.
[1:39:37] Standing like this, amazing. And about
[1:39:40] several hundred people had just gone
[1:39:42] through the prayer line.
[1:39:44] He said, "Amazing."
[1:39:46] And I leaned over to him and put my
[1:39:49] mouth right to his ear and I said, "It's
[1:39:51] called the book of Acts."
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:57] That's what it is, friends.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; You can doubt it all you want to doubt
[1:40:01] it and it it'll pass you by
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; and and all kinds of churches can say,
[1:40:06] "Well, we believe the message, etc., and
[1:40:09] just be influenced by the world and go
[1:40:11] by the world and dress like the world
[1:40:13] and talk like the world and be consumed
[1:40:16] by the world and have the have the whole
[1:40:19] mentality of the world and their whole
[1:40:22] educational system and the whole
[1:40:24] financial system and the and the Bible
[1:40:27] says this the Bible says that that we're
[1:40:29] not ignorant of Satan's devices
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; and Satan will goes about as a roaring
[1:40:35] lion seeking whom whom he may devour.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; And devour is to swallow up.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; He wants to swallow up your attention.
[1:40:45] He wants to swallow up your
[1:40:47] effectiveness.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to you.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to you young ladies. I'm
[1:40:53] preaching to you young men because
[1:40:54] you're young and you're strong and you
[1:40:56] have some future. And I say get
[1:40:58] energized
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; with the message of the hour.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Let what God said inspire you.
[1:41:07] not up today. Oh, I'm everything's just
[1:41:09] wonderful today. Why is it wonderful?
[1:41:11] Cuz things are going good and I got a
[1:41:13] job and I got a raise and I got
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Don't let that inspire you. That might
[1:41:18] all be gone tomorrow.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; But say everything's going fine because
[1:41:25] I just heard a messenger say that
[1:41:28] everything's in place.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Everything's just fine with the bride of
[1:41:32] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Where's the clicker?
[1:41:44] I I need a clicker for the
[1:41:48] Oh, thanks.
[1:41:52] I want you to read a few uh a few quotes
[1:41:54] with me.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Is that all right? I'm not going to I'm
[1:41:58] not going to blaze through any as much
[1:42:00] as I would like to.
[1:42:05] Wherefore, when he cometh into the
[1:42:06] world, can I have the lights dimmed,
[1:42:08] please?
[1:42:10] Thank you.
[1:42:12] Sacrifice and offering, thou wouldst
[1:42:14] not, but a body hast thou prepared me? I
[1:42:17] just want to stop there once again. What
[1:42:19] kind of a body? Is this a body just to
[1:42:21] appease the enemy? Is this a body just
[1:42:24] to help us through this life? No.
[1:42:28] It's a body that would bring such a
[1:42:30] victory.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; And if we can see that victory and
[1:42:36] participate in that victory,
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; that's what
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't like to use personal
[1:42:43] examples but sometimes you hear so much
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; so much
[1:42:50] and you hear people's burdens
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; and you have to come to a place where
[1:42:55] you finally say well you know that's
[1:42:58] what it is it is what it is
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; just hang on I'll get to it in a moment
[1:43:07] and burnt offerings and sacrifices for
[1:43:09] sin now hast had no pleasure. Then said,
[1:43:12] "Lo, I come in the volume of the book.
[1:43:15] It is written of me to do thy will, oh
[1:43:17] God, and I will say to you, he did it."
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; But to the elected, and I only have
[1:43:27] this, I won't probably read it all, but
[1:43:30] to the elected. God is calling to the
[1:43:33] elected. They know it. Yeah.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Calling the virtuous bride, the word,
[1:43:38] the last day church, the elected lady of
[1:43:41] our Lord Jesus Christ. Word.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the word. How many believe
[1:43:46] that?
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; All right. Then the bride is always part
[1:43:50] of the bridegroom. So the bride will not
[1:43:53] be a denomination. It'll why why does he
[1:43:56] say denomination? Because they have
[1:43:58] their own se they have their own book.
[1:44:01] They have their own solution of words.
[1:44:03] We hold up message books here uh
[1:44:05] frequently all all the rest of it.
[1:44:08] That's fine. But the message book would
[1:44:11] absolutely agree with this Bible.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; We hold this as our absolute.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; I don't make I don't differentiate the
[1:44:23] the the message came to reveal Jesus
[1:44:26] Christ and he is the word. Amen.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; And came to reveal him in the scripture.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; You may have a question on that.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Never loses his pattern. He always did
[1:44:40] it by the pattern. He done it every time
[1:44:43] by the pattern. He does it again.
[1:44:45] Calling out his virtuous bride in the
[1:44:47] last day. The lovely Rebecca waiting for
[1:44:49] her Isaac. He said, "Uh, what a
[1:44:52] beautiful time." Yes.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Now, here it brings, now this is where I
[1:44:57] want you to your full attention. Here it
[1:45:00] brings into view the two books that's
[1:45:03] going to be mysterious to you when you
[1:45:06] read the book of the seven church ages.
[1:45:09] The two books, the book of life said,
[1:45:13] one says you can put your name on you
[1:45:16] never you never comes off. Other one
[1:45:20] says you take his name out of the book
[1:45:22] of life. This brings it perfectly into
[1:45:25] view right here
[1:45:29] in the invisible union of the bride of
[1:45:31] Jesus Christ. So that you know and here
[1:45:34] is very special. I have it. So I'd like
[1:45:38] everyone's attention. I wrote this big
[1:45:40] so you can see it on the balcony. Life
[1:45:43] is a sacred thing to God and it's
[1:45:47] recorded in a book.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; God is the author of life. Every book
[1:45:52] has to have an author.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; God is the author of the book of life.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; And do you believe that
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; our natural life here that we have,
[1:46:07] everybody has it.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; We're all natural persons, individual
[1:46:11] persons. Our natural life here we have
[1:46:14] is just a perversion. It really should
[1:46:19] be the right life to begin with. But
[1:46:23] it's perverted by the natural birth. Did
[1:46:28] anyone come here outside the natural
[1:46:30] birth? I think we all came by natural
[1:46:33] birth.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; That's the problem.
[1:46:41] That's right.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; You just wait. Now
[1:46:47] the first life or your first union you
[1:46:51] were joined in at birth by nature. A
[1:46:56] natural act. A natural human being being
[1:47:00] associated man and woman together
[1:47:03] associated together in sexual affair
[1:47:07] which brought your first life here. And
[1:47:10] that's associated with sin and death.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Now it was nature associated with death.
[1:47:18] Your first husband
[1:47:21] that had rule over you was your nature
[1:47:25] by natural birth.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Have you followed thus far?
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Natural. You love the world.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Some of you might be right here.
[1:47:40] Love the world because you are the world
[1:47:43] and part of the world. That right? Your
[1:47:46] desires was by nature to love the world
[1:47:50] which you're a part of. You're a part of
[1:47:52] nature. You believe that and that's your
[1:47:56] natural thing.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; That's the reason you have to be born
[1:48:00] again.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; You have to separate.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; You have to die to that first husband.
[1:48:08] You can't. And notice he said husband.
[1:48:11] There's another scripture
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; here. Listen real close now. I don't
[1:48:16] have I have so much
[1:48:18] in my heart, in my mind that I want to
[1:48:20] give to you. But Jesus uh the word of
[1:48:24] God speaks in in Romans says, "Know ye
[1:48:28] not that she that is married to her
[1:48:32] husband, something like that, is is
[1:48:35] united or married until he dies."
[1:48:41] And then further on in the scripture, it
[1:48:44] says it speaks of Christ
[1:48:48] picking the death
[1:48:51] and Christ died to free us from that
[1:48:56] natural husband.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; You could not be free outside of a death
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; and you were united by your natural
[1:49:08] birth. Now I want to say to everyone
[1:49:10] here, there isn't one person here, not
[1:49:12] one person who planned their own natural
[1:49:16] birth.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Your mother and father when you were
[1:49:19] conceived in the womb of your mother.
[1:49:22] They perhaps didn't even know anything
[1:49:23] about you. Maybe mother didn't even know
[1:49:26] you were conceived. But God knew there
[1:49:29] was a life coming.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; And God knew whether he was going to
[1:49:33] talk to that life. God knew before the
[1:49:36] foundation of the world if that was an
[1:49:38] elected life. And I would just say
[1:49:40] friends, if you were elected, you might
[1:49:42] as well give up.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; God is not going to lose you.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; God is not going to let you make another
[1:49:50] choice.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; You'll say, "What will he do?" He'll
[1:49:53] just squeeze it and squeeze it. Yes,
[1:49:55] you'll make it. Say, "Well, is God
[1:49:58] arbitrarily going to say one go to
[1:50:00] heaven, one go to hell?" Nonsense.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; That's just the world. That's just a
[1:50:04] mind of man trying to argue about the
[1:50:07] things of God. God doesn't say, "I'm
[1:50:10] going to save one. I'm going to cast one
[1:50:12] to hell." That's not what God does. God
[1:50:14] by fornowledge. He knew who would
[1:50:18] receive him and who would not receive
[1:50:20] him. And that's what this Bible says.
[1:50:24] Whom he forneew them he predestinated.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; But man in his wisdom, he doesn't want
[1:50:31] predestination. He wants to think, "I
[1:50:33] want to make my own choice." Oh, yeah.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; I'd like to see the man. I'd like to
[1:50:40] meet the man or the woman that make
[1:50:42] their own choice and make their own life
[1:50:44] happy and all the rest of it. That's
[1:50:46] nonsense.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; I even had a I had a close friend of
[1:50:50] mine, a business associate, and he said
[1:50:53] he said, "All I want to be is happy. I
[1:50:55] just want I tell you what, his life was
[1:50:58] anything but happy.
[1:51:04] The best thing you can do, the only
[1:51:06] thing you can do is commit your ways
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; unto the Lord and he'll direct your
[1:51:11] path. He'll direct your footsteps. I
[1:51:14] don't care who you are. I don't care
[1:51:16] what country you're from. I can preach
[1:51:18] this to the world. This is the only
[1:51:20] solution. You're either elected of God
[1:51:23] or you're not elected. And this is a and
[1:51:25] and the fact he brings the gospel to you
[1:51:28] is his elected love.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; He loves you. He loves you. And it's
[1:51:34] elective love.
[1:51:36] [Music]
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; You can't just say, uh, well, I'll
[1:51:44] divorce him. I'll hang him up here. In
[1:51:47] other words, what the prophet is saying,
[1:51:49] you you can't just take your nature and
[1:51:51] say, well, I'll just separate from it.
[1:51:53] I'll just do it on my own. You can't do
[1:51:56] that.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; He He He dies. The nature of the world
[1:52:00] has to die. Every spect of him has to
[1:52:02] die. You have to be reunited again with
[1:52:07] another nature.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; This is what the message came to do.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; This isn't just some simple little
[1:52:18] Sunday school class. It is absolutely
[1:52:22] simple but yet it is it it is it has to
[1:52:27] be believed in its simplicity. You have
[1:52:29] to believe it.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; You can't just shove it off to the side.
[1:52:34] You you just have to believe it.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; It's all I can say.
[1:52:40] Now the Bible says in in I think it's
[1:52:43] Romans the 7th chapter says that a woman
[1:52:46] that's married to a man is married him
[1:52:49] to him as long as he liveth etc. Then it
[1:52:52] says that Christ died.
[1:52:57] And perhaps I should just read it.
[1:53:23] If you want to follow along, it's Romans
[1:53:25] 7. Know you not, brethren, for I speak
[1:53:29] to them that know the law. Now, as we're
[1:53:32] reading the first verses, don't get
[1:53:34] sidetracked into into what your mind
[1:53:36] thinks Paul is saying.
[1:53:40] Know ye not, brethren, for I speak to
[1:53:41] them that know the law, how that the law
[1:53:43] hath dominion over a man as long as he
[1:53:46] liveth. For the woman which hath an
[1:53:48] husband is bound by the law of her
[1:53:50] husband as long as he liveth. Uh but if
[1:53:54] the husband be dead, she is loosed from
[1:53:58] the law of her husband. I want you to
[1:54:00] think of the husband of your first
[1:54:02] nature.
[1:54:04] that you you receive that nature by your
[1:54:08] natural birth.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said that was your
[1:54:12] husband.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; You're united to him. And Paul, the
[1:54:17] same. Paul is saying the only way that
[1:54:19] you can be free from that husband is if
[1:54:22] the husband die. Now, we think of
[1:54:24] Calvary. We think of Calvary and the the
[1:54:27] nails and Jesus hanging there and all
[1:54:29] these things. The Calvary was much more
[1:54:31] than that.
[1:54:33] Jesus in the act of Calvary took every
[1:54:36] person here, took every sin, every
[1:54:40] iniquity and furthermore took the took
[1:54:44] the responsibility of your union with
[1:54:49] sin.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; He became that husband
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; because he took the sins of the world.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:55:02] You following me?
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; All right. He he became that husband
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; because you were you were united. It
[1:55:10] took a message to tell you that
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; that that was your first husband.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; And saying that you're united till that
[1:55:19] husband dies,
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; then you're free.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Have you followed that close?
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, just listen. This is
[1:55:27] what it says.
[1:55:29] Wherefore, my brethren, ye also, you
[1:55:33] also become dead to the law, which was
[1:55:37] all of our works, by the body of Christ,
[1:55:42] that you should be married to another.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; That you should you should be married to
[1:55:50] another. You can't be married to another
[1:55:52] till you're free from the one. You said,
[1:55:54] "Well, I was born this way.
[1:55:57] I was born with these f I was born with
[1:56:00] this
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; appetites and these desires.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; You know, Satan doesn't want me to
[1:56:06] announce this to you.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; The purpose of Jesus Christ came is to
[1:56:13] break that union.
[1:56:16] [Music]
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; And Satan doesn't want you to understand
[1:56:20] that. He doesn't want he'd soon have our
[1:56:23] mind become lethargic. And that's not
[1:56:26] the plan of God. I've been wrestling
[1:56:28] over this message for a long time and
[1:56:30] determine that I'm going to stay with it
[1:56:33] and going to preach it if it takes all
[1:56:34] afternoon till you know that God uh you
[1:56:38] we we all in the human because of our
[1:56:40] human natural ability,
[1:56:43] our natural desires. And the prophet was
[1:56:46] asked a question. He was asked a
[1:56:49] question.
[1:56:54] Just want your attention.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; He was asked a question.
[1:57:20] There's 10.
[1:57:32] Uh, just give me a moment here.
[1:57:40] Where's that scripture? It says what I
[1:57:43] would do when I would do good. I
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; chapter seven
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; seven.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Maybe that's why I couldn't find it. I
[1:57:51] thought it was elsewhere.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Yes. Okay.
[1:57:57] Says, "Wherefore, my brethren, you also
[1:58:00] are become dead to the law by the body
[1:58:02] of Christ, that you should be married to
[1:58:06] another, even to him who is raised from
[1:58:10] the dead." So that doesn't that that's
[1:58:14] not just Jesus who walked by the shores
[1:58:16] of Galilee. This is the Jesus that died
[1:58:19] and rose again
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; and those who walked with him didn't
[1:58:24] know him at the moment and rose from the
[1:58:27] dead that we should be bring forth fruit
[1:58:31] unto God.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; These aren't idle words, friends. This
[1:58:35] is what God has said in his word. And
[1:58:37] you were in church Sunday morning that
[1:58:39] we might bring forth fruit. You are the
[1:58:42] fruit of your mother's womb.
[1:58:45] God sends his word to us so that we
[1:58:49] bring forth fruit. In other words, we
[1:58:52] don't just say we're message believers
[1:58:54] or that we believe on Jesus Christ,
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; but we look and act and are like him.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I'm not saying I possess it
[1:59:06] all. I'm I'm preaching it anyway.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching it because this is God's
[1:59:11] word.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; And I preach it not because I have a
[1:59:15] history of acting like a superhuman
[1:59:18] person. No. In fact is we're super weak.
[1:59:22] But we have to declare it anyway.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God. It's the only way
[1:59:26] to confess it.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:30] For when we were in the flesh, the
[1:59:32] motions of sin which were by the law did
[1:59:35] work in our members to bring forth fruit
[1:59:38] unto death. But now we are delivered. I
[1:59:42] say now we are delivered. Let all the
[1:59:45] delivered of the Lord say so.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; From the law uh that being dead wherein
[1:59:50] we were held that we should serve in
[1:59:54] newness of spirit and not in the oldness
[1:59:57] oldness of the letter. Amen.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Now, uh,
[2:00:13] no, no, it's not. It's not seven,
[2:00:15] brothers. If you could just help me a
[2:00:17] moment. He says, "When I would do good,
[2:00:20] evil is present with me. The things
[2:00:22] which I
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; 78."
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Pardon?
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; 7 verse 18.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; 7 verse 18. Okay.
[2:00:32] All right. Now, a man asked uh brother
[2:00:36] Brennham this question. He said, "I have
[2:00:38] a question." That was in questions and
[2:00:40] answers of 1964.
[2:00:56] I want to start with verse 14 of of
[2:00:59] seven.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; For we know that the law is spiritual,
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; but I am carnal,
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; sold under sin,
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; for for that which I do I allow not.
[2:01:13] But what I would that do I not.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; But what I hate, that do I.
[2:01:20] and then I do that which I would not. I
[2:01:25] consent unto the law that it is good.
[2:01:28] But now it is no more I that do it, but
[2:01:32] sin that dwelleth in me. And the man
[2:01:35] said, I don't understand this.
[2:01:39] And by your quietness, you say the same
[2:01:42] thing. I don't understand this.
[2:01:46] That's why I want your full attention.
[2:01:49] says, "For I know that in me that is in
[2:01:53] my flesh,
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; yes,
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; that came by this natural birth,
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; dwelleth no good thing,
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; for to will is present with me, but how
[2:02:03] to perform that which is good I find
[2:02:06] not."
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says this, he says
[2:02:09] after he read the scripture, he said,
[2:02:12] "Well, they wrote out the scripture."
[2:02:14] That's Paul's speaking to the Romans.
[2:02:17] Let me just kind of polish it up so you
[2:02:20] can see.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "So now I know that this is
[2:02:26] difficult. I've been wrestling with it."
[2:02:29] He says, "In me is two persons.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; Right, one wants me to do right, one
[2:02:40] wants me to do right, and wrong, the
[2:02:43] other wants me to do."
[2:02:46] And every time I start doing right, the
[2:02:49] wrong hinders me.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; This is down where you live.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not up in the pie in the sky.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; I'm down where you live.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; God happens to know exactly what your
[2:03:04] what you live.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; And the other wants me to do wrong. And
[2:03:11] every time I try to do right, wrong
[2:03:13] hinders me. He said, "How many of you
[2:03:16] people on the interview this afternoon?"
[2:03:20] Now he's talking about his own
[2:03:21] interviews that he had this afternoon.
[2:03:23] That afternoon, he said interviews this
[2:03:26] afternoon has run the same thing in this
[2:03:30] morning. Same same thing, spoke on it
[2:03:34] this morning temporarily.
[2:03:36] He said you are an outward man which is
[2:03:40] controlled by six senses. Other places
[2:03:43] he had said five senses but the six
[2:03:45] sense is faith. He says you are an
[2:03:48] outward man which is controlled by six
[2:03:50] senses. You are an inward man controlled
[2:03:53] by one sense which is faith.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; And this faith disagrees
[2:03:59] and this faith disagrees with all six
[2:04:02] senses. or let's just say, well, it's
[2:04:05] five senses. But faith disagrees with
[2:04:08] the senses of this body because the
[2:04:11] scripture says and teaches us and the
[2:04:14] message teaches us that these senses are
[2:04:16] given to us to contact this earthly
[2:04:19] life.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; And so we feel
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; and we have also in our in the spirit
[2:04:26] realm, we have our emotions. And your
[2:04:29] emotions, friends, don't lead you to
[2:04:32] truth.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; It's not your emotions. Your emotions
[2:04:37] makes you, oh, I feel real, you know,
[2:04:40] righteous or I feel holy. I feel good.
[2:04:43] It has nothing to do. You might come
[2:04:44] into this church feeling rotten. And
[2:04:47] that's the very time God wants to speak
[2:04:49] to you.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[2:04:59] And you are an outward man which is
[2:05:01] controlled by six senses. You're an
[2:05:03] inward man controlled by one sense which
[2:05:06] is faith. And this faith disagrees with
[2:05:08] all six senses in this and the six
[2:05:11] senses doesn't agree with faith. Uh if
[2:05:15] the six senses doesn't agree with faith
[2:05:18] but one is contrary to the other. Now as
[2:05:21] long as the six senses agree with the
[2:05:24] faith, wonderful. But when the six
[2:05:27] senses disagree with faith, then leave
[2:05:29] the six senses alone.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; We are carnal.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; We are carnal and that part must perish.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; But then inside we are a spirit man,
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; a soul inside. And that's faith in God's
[2:05:47] word. When we bring our outward body
[2:05:50] under subjection to the word of by faith
[2:05:54] by accepting what God said.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; By accepting by what God said.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me?
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; Just one paragraph. How can I take a
[2:06:06] cucklebar a cuckle burr and make and
[2:06:10] here's the key. How can I take a cuckle
[2:06:13] burr and make a grain of wheat out of
[2:06:16] it? It's impossible
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; for me to do it. The only way it can be
[2:06:23] is because inside that cockleber has
[2:06:26] been transmitted
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; from a cockleber wheat uh a cockleber to
[2:06:32] a a germ called wheat life.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Now just listen close because this is
[2:06:39] ultra simple and yet it gets real deep
[2:06:44] and it's something you have to believe.
[2:06:47] If you're going to come to a deliverance
[2:06:49] and a victory,
[2:06:51] he says, "Then you bury the cuckleber
[2:06:54] and it'll produce a grain of wheat."
[2:06:59] That's if there there's been
[2:07:00] transmitted. You might say, "Well,
[2:07:02] scientifically, how does that work?"
[2:07:03] We're not talking about science now.
[2:07:05] We're talking about what God
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; the creator
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; has done. And he has a servant putting
[2:07:14] it in such simple language that you are
[2:07:17] obliged to believe it or disbelieve it.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; And this is what you believe. Then you
[2:07:23] bury the cocklebar
[2:07:25] and it'll produce a grain of wheat
[2:07:30] because there has been a life of wheat
[2:07:33] put in the cocklebar
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; and the life of the cockleber
[2:07:39] has been taken out. Come on.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; But the nature of the cockleber is still
[2:07:44] sticky.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; And it will be until this new life has
[2:07:53] fully been developed out of the ground
[2:07:56] and raised up again.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand, one place calls it the
[2:08:00] acid of death
[2:08:03] or in the process of death. And when it
[2:08:06] comes forth, then it's no more cuckleber
[2:08:09] but wheat. Right.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; He says, "But while it's here on earth,
[2:08:14] out of the earth and a cuckleber, and we
[2:08:18] are out of the earth,
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; we all are out of the earth. And we have
[2:08:22] certain frailties and certain things,
[2:08:26] and
[2:08:30] I I don't want to get to specifics,
[2:08:32] otherwise it just gets quieter and
[2:08:34] quieter."
[2:08:38] But we all have a sticky part.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; And in the body of Christ, this is what
[2:08:47] I'm really preaching on. I would have
[2:08:48] come to this. In the body of Christ,
[2:08:53] this is where we have problems
[2:08:56] being a united body because we all run
[2:09:00] into each other's sticky part.
[2:09:04] says, "Well, you know, I don't really,
[2:09:06] you know, I don't think I I don't see
[2:09:08] that way. I don't like, you know, I
[2:09:10] don't perhaps care for them, so I better
[2:09:13] carry on."
[2:09:21] and a cuckleber. And a cuckleber,
[2:09:25] it's still sticky, but it's got the
[2:09:28] nature on the inside of it of wheat.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; This is where sticky people
[2:09:40] who realize it ought to be shouting
[2:09:43] hallelujah.
[2:09:45] We got a sticky nature, but inside of it
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; speaks a prophet of God is a wheat life.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; And as long as you're in this life,
[2:09:57] you're going to be sticky and have a
[2:10:00] carnal nature that's going to bother you
[2:10:03] as long as you live. But the inside of
[2:10:06] you,
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; you're born again.
[2:10:10] And when you're raised up,
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; you're in the likeness of Christ
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; and all the sin, all the sin is gone
[2:10:18] from you.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; That's part of the preparation.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; And the thing is, if if we can just
[2:10:26] simply accept that,
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; okay, that's a sticky part.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; I got that sticky part from a natural
[2:10:35] birth. Yeah,
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; someone might be this say, "Well, I'm
[2:10:38] Irish or I'm Ukrainian or I'm German or
[2:10:42] I'm something else." And we don't want
[2:10:44] to be making excuses for things. And
[2:10:48] this this is not to make excuses, but it
[2:10:51] is to see it clearly and say, "Uh-huh.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; I see that.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I Well, today it's a little rough.
[2:10:58] I'm just dealing with a sticky part.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; Sometimes when you the sticky part comes
[2:11:07] up, you just say, "Excuse me a second. I
[2:11:10] got to count to 10."
[2:11:13] [Laughter]
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; No, you folks don't have that problem.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; That happens to be the truth.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you believe it or
[2:11:28] not. That's the truth
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; and that's the way it is. Amen.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; And people can become so uh mature and
[2:11:38] so holy and so devout and so righteous.
[2:11:43] But somewhere along the line,
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; it comes up,
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; it comes up. And when we talk about the
[2:11:52] union of the husband and the wife,
[2:11:56] I don't care how wonderful things are
[2:11:59] here at the altar.
[2:12:03] Somewhere along the line, the sticky
[2:12:05] part shows up
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; somewhere along the line. And uh you
[2:12:10] know, I've counseledled people
[2:12:13] who've had marriage problems and then
[2:12:15] when they sit down
[2:12:17] in my office, they they just feel so
[2:12:20] embarrassed. They say, "Well, you know,
[2:12:22] it's not really worth talking about."
[2:12:24] That's exactly right. It's not not worth
[2:12:27] talking about. And and sometimes it's
[2:12:30] it's the simplest things.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; You think I'm making up these stories?
[2:12:38] Not a bit.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; One woman could not stand how her
[2:12:44] husband squeezed the half a grapefruit
[2:12:47] and slurped the or the slurp the
[2:12:50] grapefruit. Jo,
[2:12:52] I can't stand that. And that was their
[2:12:55] big problem. That was one of their
[2:12:57] problems. You say, "Is that is that and
[2:13:00] the other one?" and he couldn't stand
[2:13:02] the way she squeezed it toothpaste out
[2:13:05] of the toothpaste tube, rolled it, and
[2:13:07] got the last out of it.
[2:13:10] This will go around the world. But my my
[2:13:12] wife, she's so frugal, she cuts them
[2:13:15] open.
[2:13:17] See, she's back there waving like this,
[2:13:20] telling me I've gone far enough.
[2:13:26] But doesn't bother me. I just have to it
[2:13:28] it I I save some money when she squeezes
[2:13:31] the last out of the I mean it just isn't
[2:13:35] that funny. We're just we're born that
[2:13:37] way.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; We're born that way. Some are born so
[2:13:40] frugal and some were born so liberal and
[2:13:43] some were born however we're born. Blame
[2:13:46] somebody
[2:13:48] as long as we can blame somebody back
[2:13:50] there in the past.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Well, I just inherited it. I asked my
[2:13:55] wife this morning. She didn't know
[2:13:57] exactly what I was going to preach on. I
[2:13:58] says, "It's really strange." I said,
[2:14:00] "You know, a doctor, that's an easy way
[2:14:02] out for a doctor to say, "Oh, you just
[2:14:04] inherited it." I said, "What does that
[2:14:06] mean?"
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; That still doesn't diagnose the problem.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; I got I got a problem. He said, "Well,
[2:14:13] you inherited it."
[2:14:17] You don't believe it. I went to a
[2:14:18] doctor. I went to my doctor and I said,
[2:14:20] "I I've got this." He said, "Just thank
[2:14:22] your parents for it."
[2:14:25] I said, 'Well, I have another thing. I
[2:14:27] had three things I want to talk. I said,
[2:14:29] 'I'm too skinny. Can you believe I was
[2:14:31] too skinny? I was like, Michael. And he
[2:14:33] said, you'll live longer. What's the
[2:14:35] other one?
[2:14:38] And I had a I I had a third one. And he
[2:14:40] says he says, "You inherited that also."
[2:14:42] He said, "Just give the girl five bucks
[2:14:44] on the way out." And I was all done.
[2:14:48] That's when we had to pay $5.
[2:14:55] But in spite of that,
[2:14:58] in spite and did God know we were going
[2:15:00] to be sticky?
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; He knew that.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; He knew that.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; I sit down.
[2:15:10] I've got to be careful here because I I
[2:15:13] run into personalities. And
[2:15:16] um
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; should I preach?
[2:15:25] God knew every little sticky part of us.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; But nevertheless, that didn't hinder his
[2:15:32] election.
[2:15:34] Said, "You're elected anyway.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; I don't care how sticky you are. I don't
[2:15:38] care what kind of problem you have. I I
[2:15:41] elect some and those that I elect of my
[2:15:44] children, they're my children
[2:15:45] regardless."
[2:15:47] says, "Well, we could go to we could go
[2:15:50] to we could go to Matthew the 1st
[2:15:52] chapter and say, well, uh, Bath Sheba, I
[2:15:55] could I could give you some things. I've
[2:15:57] wrestled with this. Ba Sheba, she was
[2:16:00] married to Uriah. Uriah was a loyal man
[2:16:04] in in David's army. And David had
[2:16:07] committed adultery with Ba Sheba.
[2:16:11] You say, "Well, you know, now we start
[2:16:13] running out of space because we like
[2:16:15] things to be clean and holy and so on so
[2:16:17] forth."
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; And and and and I'm not belittling being
[2:16:22] clean and holy. I'm not belittling that.
[2:16:24] Not for a moment. But I'm I I'm saying
[2:16:28] be sure you don't bel grace.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; Be sure you don't belittle election.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; If God elects something,
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; that's that's what's important to him.
[2:16:38] I've elected them. I bless who I bless
[2:16:42] and I curse who I curse. That's exactly
[2:16:45] what God And when God blesses somebody,
[2:16:48] he'll bless their family. He'll bless
[2:16:50] all that's around them. He'll bless what
[2:16:52] they do. He'll bless when they lay down.
[2:16:55] He'll bless them in the night time.
[2:16:57] He'll do all kinds of things. And anyone
[2:16:59] who rises up comes against them, he
[2:17:01] won't all he won't tolerate it.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; He just won't let it happen.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:17:07] And then people down here, all the
[2:17:10] sticky stuff comes up
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; and says, "Well, you know, uh, they
[2:17:14] think they're somebody." No, it's not
[2:17:16] that. It's a God has shone his light
[2:17:19] upon them.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; They don't want to regard that. And I'll
[2:17:24] tell you something, friends. The world
[2:17:27] hates this message,
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; but God happens to love it. And so
[2:17:33] people rise up against it and he doesn't
[2:17:35] allow it to prosper.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; And then they get, you know, more even
[2:17:39] more sticky and say, "Well, you think
[2:17:41] you're somebody." No, no, I really
[2:17:43] don't. Well, you think you're the bride.
[2:17:45] What's wrong with thinking you're the
[2:17:47] bride?
[2:17:52] What do you think you're somebody?
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; You know, friends,
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I can say at least at the age
[2:18:05] that I am to be able to share some of
[2:18:07] this with you.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; We've gone a long ways.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; We've come a long ways down the road.
[2:18:12] We've seen a lot of water go under the
[2:18:14] bridge. And so I can tell you that these
[2:18:16] are some things that I have experienced
[2:18:18] and we and and we we keep on uh we keep
[2:18:23] on asking
[2:18:24] and some of you won't maybe like what
[2:18:26] I'm preaching but you've got I'm not
[2:18:29] saying that you got to get rid of your
[2:18:31] sticky nature. Some preachers spend all
[2:18:34] their time trying to get people free of
[2:18:37] their sticky nature when a prophet says
[2:18:40] you'll have it till you die
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; because you were born. We have to
[2:18:45] believe what the scripture says. And the
[2:18:47] scripture says we're married to that
[2:18:50] nature.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; That nature was our husband.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; But Jesus Christ, this is the glory of
[2:18:56] the cross.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; He went to the cross.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; He became sin for us. He died a death
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; so that our husband died
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; and we're married to another. That's a
[2:19:09] revealed and that's why the revelation
[2:19:11] of Jesus Christ is so important to us
[2:19:15] because we're not married. We're not
[2:19:17] married to who William Brandom was.
[2:19:20] We're married to the Jesus Christ that
[2:19:23] was revealed in the message God sent
[2:19:25] him.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, if you can see this, I'm
[2:19:29] gonna say a mouthful now. God has come
[2:19:32] and revealed Jesus Christ to you so you
[2:19:35] could see him and see who it was you're
[2:19:38] married to.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; And people who are looking for now I'm
[2:19:43] coming right down to the message. People
[2:19:45] are looking for or they're looking for
[2:19:47] brother Brandon to come back or they're
[2:19:49] looking for someone else to raise up or
[2:19:51] they need somebody or they need some
[2:19:53] hero. You don't have the message.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; The message is Jesus Christ.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you see him in his beauty
[2:20:02] and you see him in his redemptive power
[2:20:05] and you see him revealing himself today,
[2:20:08] you say, "That's my husband."
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Daniel. Now,
[2:20:16] shake my hand.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:26] Some might like it,
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; some may not like it, but I'm saying it
[2:20:30] on behalf of my husband.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's someone that's revealed
[2:20:38] to you.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close now.
[2:20:52] I think I got the message across.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to just close with this.
[2:21:01] This is the summon substance.
[2:21:04] I
[2:21:07] went over this. You know, sometimes I
[2:21:09] just have to preach it.
[2:21:12] I've never been able to
[2:21:15] preach it.
[2:21:17] to my wife. The way Brother Brandham
[2:21:19] said he he got his wife and he had to
[2:21:21] preach to her. I thought that must be
[2:21:24] wonderful. But I was so full the first
[2:21:26] time in my life right on this. I just
[2:21:30] laid in bed and I just started to preach
[2:21:34] cuz I wanted to see how my wife was
[2:21:36] going to how she would uh react to this.
[2:21:41] So I kind of use her as a temperature
[2:21:43] gauge to see how the congregation.
[2:21:46] Now we are on this side.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; Now we're on the New Testament side.
[2:21:50] We're not in the Old Testament. Say,
[2:21:52] "Well, he said, "A body hast thou
[2:21:54] prepared me?"
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:22:00] the scripture says, the Bible says,
[2:22:05] "No, you're not. You're the body of
[2:22:07] Christ."
[2:22:10] Oh, we're the body of Christ. Amen.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; Prepared body
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; and we see ourselves
[2:22:27] uh that's why I said in Edmonton
[2:22:32] said brother Brandham said something
[2:22:35] and this bothered me
[2:22:39] and you're all listening. This is what
[2:22:41] he said.
[2:22:44] He said, "My ministry is a ministry to
[2:22:48] unite the body of Christ."
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Boy, oh boy, I've been
[2:22:55] preaching this message for a lot of
[2:22:56] years, and we're probably further from
[2:22:59] it.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; What would he think?
[2:23:03] What does God think?
[2:23:05] And why are we divided?" Well, somebody
[2:23:08] has an opinion or somebody thinks
[2:23:11] something else.
[2:23:13] And I was thinking this morning, Brother
[2:23:15] Tom, Brother John, Brother Tim, this
[2:23:18] church has been identified as being very
[2:23:21] legalistic.
[2:23:25] If those people happen to be listening
[2:23:27] today,
[2:23:28] they're going to think
[2:23:30] Brother Ed is dropped off the deep end.
[2:23:34] He's talking about people that were
[2:23:36] murderers and adulteresses and all kinds
[2:23:38] of things. I just want to tell you
[2:23:41] something.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; If there's anything that you can do
[2:23:47] to contribute to salvation,
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; I'm going to just say mouthpiece in just
[2:23:53] a moment. If there's anything that you
[2:23:55] can do that can contribute to salvation,
[2:23:58] that's not the salvation that can save
[2:24:00] us.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; And we read, hello.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the book of life, the
[2:24:12] lamb's book of life,
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; that your name or now you see your life
[2:24:22] is in the lamb's book of life. And
[2:24:24] that's the only way that you are saved.
[2:24:26] Those whose names were in the book of
[2:24:28] life of the lamb before the foundation
[2:24:31] of the world Amen.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want everyone with me.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world,
[2:24:39] before the foundation of the world, you
[2:24:42] were a a wheat life, a seed
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; in the mind of God
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; where there is no sin.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; There can be no sin
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; in the mind of God.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; No sin,
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; no sinful nature in the mind of God. He
[2:25:01] sees I'm going to have this person come.
[2:25:04] Then the fall came and the sticky nature
[2:25:07] came and everyone was born by a sec
[2:25:10] natural sexual birth and we inherited uh
[2:25:14] sticky nature.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; This isn't making excuse. This happens
[2:25:18] to be the reality. It's the way it is.
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; We got certain weaknesses, certain
[2:25:23] frailties, certain things. I'm not
[2:25:25] suggesting we can just be lustful and
[2:25:28] feed out that lustful desire. I'm not
[2:25:30] saying that. I'm saying you have the
[2:25:32] power within you to overcome that and
[2:25:35] let that thing die the death.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; But neither can you neither can you can
[2:25:42] neither can you put any sin into the
[2:25:45] lamb's book of life.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying it's that you can keep it
[2:25:50] out. I'm saying that God who provided
[2:25:54] this redemption that you have saw you
[2:25:57] sinless before he even wrote your name
[2:26:00] in the book.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; He knew you were going to fall.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; He knew you were going to come into this
[2:26:07] world.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; He knew you were going to come in as a
[2:26:10] sinner and a liar and a deceit and all
[2:26:12] the rest of it. He knew all of that.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; And I'm not even perhaps saying
[2:26:17] everything that happened.
[2:26:19] He knew all of that.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; He knew all about your young life and
[2:26:26] your youth. And
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; he knew all about that.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; He knew all about the temptations. He
[2:26:32] knew all about the sticky nature. He
[2:26:33] knew all about the temper and and the
[2:26:35] maybe the hatred and the bitterness of
[2:26:38] Are you with me?
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; He knew all about that before he wrote
[2:26:42] your name in the book.
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; Before he wrote your name in the book.
[2:26:48] Amen.
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; And I am electing them to have this
[2:26:52] place in my book.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; And this is a book. The pages of this
[2:26:56] book aren't 50/50.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; 50% righteous and 50% sinful.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; The book of life, the book, Lamb's book
[2:27:06] of life is absolutely sinless.
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; And if you can see that,
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; then you need to see the Old Testament
[2:27:16] saints. That's how come because the
[2:27:20] other side of the in the New Testament
[2:27:22] the other side of the cross you cannot
[2:27:25] find after the after the Christ came who
[2:27:29] was a full sacrifice for sin.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; Everything that Rahab was, she is pure.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; Everything Bath Sheba was, she's pure.
[2:27:41] Everything David was, he's without sin
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; on this side because Calvary paid it
[2:27:49] all.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; And if you can see that and say, "Oh,
[2:27:55] that's all right." In the past, that's
[2:27:57] what's going on right now.
[2:28:03] [Applause]
[2:28:06] You look at yourself.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; You're not worthy of heaven.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; But you're worthy of heaven by God's
[2:28:13] word.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; That I have called you.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; I have redeemed you.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; Your sins I will remember no more.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; That's our God.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of religion I have.
[2:28:27] Amen.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of religion you have
[2:28:30] must have.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; If you're going to go to heaven, you
[2:28:33] must have a religion that that God says
[2:28:36] your sins I will remember no more.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; And I have written a book. It's called
[2:28:41] the lamb's book of life. Yeah. You had a
[2:28:44] book of life. And the brother Brandham
[2:28:46] says you might get confused and think
[2:28:47] there's two books. Actually the one
[2:28:49] comes into the other one because we were
[2:28:52] all born a natural birth came with a
[2:28:56] sticky nature but God in his abundant
[2:29:00] grace took care of it by predestination
[2:29:03] says I saw them before the sticky nature
[2:29:06] came.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; I saw them they were mine and I declared
[2:29:10] them as mine before Adam fell before Eve
[2:29:14] did what she did. I declared them to be.
[2:29:17] Listen, friends, here we are in 2016.
[2:29:20] I'm here to say that isn't when we
[2:29:22] started. We started in the mind of God.
[2:29:25] You folks started in the mind of God.
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; And if you weren't there, you'll never
[2:29:30] be there.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; I say, I'm glad I'm in this place.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I have that that I can believe.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; And that's what I hang on to.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; I've been perfectly honest. I say I say
[2:29:43] to my wife, if it depends on us, we'll
[2:29:46] never make it.
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; People may think we're so nice and we're
[2:29:50] just a nice old couple and we're so
[2:29:52] righteous and all the rest, but and I
[2:29:54] think we are. But on the other hand, if
[2:29:57] it if if we can contribute any goodness,
[2:30:00] I can never enter into heaven's gates.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; It's not our goodness.
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with our goodness.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad my father saw not my
[2:30:13] earthly father but my heavenly father
[2:30:16] saw the sticky nature
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; because we battle it all the time.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; You folks battle it. I happen to know
[2:30:23] you battle it. When you go out these
[2:30:25] doors, you battle it.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; And thoughts go through your mind.
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful we have a blood
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; stronger than our thoughts.
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have a blood that atoned
[2:30:39] for everything.
[2:30:43] not to allow me just to throw uh you
[2:30:46] know throw all um throw every what am I
[2:30:51] trying to say to throw all restraint to
[2:30:54] the wind. No, that's not that. We live
[2:30:57] godly in honor
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; of our Lord Jesus Christ. We want to be
[2:31:02] a true witness of the true vine. But yet
[2:31:06] every thought
[2:31:08] and and the scripture tells us that all
[2:31:10] is written. God life is a sacred thing
[2:31:13] to God and it's all written in the book.
[2:31:16] Your deeds are written in a book.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; I want to come very very straight and
[2:31:22] I'm I just the last couple minutes here.
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; There isn't one person here. I don't
[2:31:28] care how nice you are,
[2:31:30] how you're looked upon,
[2:31:32] how righteous you are, how good you
[2:31:35] live. Nobody here would want their
[2:31:39] thoughts.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. yesterday
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; on that screen
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; for all to see.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus saw them
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; when he stepped forward and said, "I'll
[2:31:58] take that book.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; I'll take that book.
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; Our book with every deed,
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; every thought,
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; everything
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; that you ever did was in that book."
[2:32:11] He says, "I'm not ashamed of it. They're

[2:38:16] [Music]
[2:38:18] revelation of his redemption
[2:38:21] in Jesus name. Brother Tom, would you
[2:38:24] please God?
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, this morning we have
[2:38:30] heard the word of life and we can truly
[2:38:33] say, do we know what it is not to have
[2:38:36] one guilty feeling? We have come through
[2:38:38] the blood of the lamb. Father, we're
[2:38:42] just so thankful that the realization of
[2:38:44] the revelation of the life of Christ has
[2:38:47] come in this hour, Lord, to redeem a
[2:38:49] people to wash her in the water of the
[2:38:52] word. That we can stand here tonight
[2:38:54] today, Lord, rejoicing knowing that the
[2:38:57] word of God has found an entrance within
[2:39:00] our lives. And we can rejoice that Jesus
[2:39:03] Christ has found us. It's not us finding
[2:39:06] God, but you found us, Lord. You planted
[2:39:09] us throughout the ages and you knew us
[2:39:11] would come down to this time at this
[2:39:14] junction and you've washed a people by
[2:39:17] the purity of the word of life and we
[2:39:20] can say holy is our God and worthy to be
[2:39:24] praised. Lord, we thank you for your
[2:39:26] servant. We thank you for the thought of
[2:39:28] God that has dropped down, Lord, this
[2:39:30] morning. That we can look at ourselves
[2:39:33] and know we've been redeemed by the
[2:39:35] blood of the lamb. Not by the works of
[2:39:38] man, not by our own hands, Lord, but by
[2:39:41] the grace of almighty God. Truly, this
[2:39:45] is amazing. as we've closed this
[2:39:47] service, singing it on our lips. Lord,
[2:39:49] that God should find a sinner such as I
[2:39:53] could change my sorrow into bliss. To
[2:39:57] know we have a future hope, to know it's
[2:40:00] things that are to be. To know we're
[2:40:02] moving from mortal to immortality. Bless
[2:40:05] your children, Lord, and strengthen
[2:40:07] Brother Ed this morning. We love him
[2:40:09] with a great love. We pray, Lord, that
[2:40:11] you'll pour in grace upon grace. Go with
[2:40:14] us, Lord. We ask in Jesus' name. Amen.
[2:40:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[2:40:22] &gt;&gt; Have you greeted one another? We'll do
[2:40:23] it again. You're dismissed in Jesus
[2:40:26] name.

[2:44:13] to give us.

[2:44:40] Amen.
[2:44:42] Almighty God
[2:44:45] [Music]
[2:44:51] as we pray that you'll touch him as this
[2:44:57] clarity
[2:44:59] we ask Jesus.
