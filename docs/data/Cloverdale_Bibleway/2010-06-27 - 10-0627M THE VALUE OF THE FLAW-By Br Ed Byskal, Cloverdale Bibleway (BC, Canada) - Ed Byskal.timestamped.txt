[0:47] sacredness there's a quietness I believe
[0:51] you've been pleased with the worship oh
[0:53] God as the people began to sing about
[0:56] their Blessed assurance and then as the
[0:59] ch children sang oh God songs of the
[1:04] Saints of Ages past songs that are as as
[1:08] alive this morning as they were when
[1:11] they were first inspired by the Holy
[1:13] Ghost I pray father that you will bless

[1:55] brand our minds Lord and prepare us even
[1:58] for the service this evening as our
[2:00] brother Tom will be ministering I ask oh
[2:03] God you'll receive us as we present
[2:05] ourselves to you as living sacrifices in
[2:09] the name of our blessed beloved Lord
[2:12] Jesus Christ amen
[2:15] amen if you'd open your
[2:18] Bibles time has slipped away on us but I
[2:22] I have a very unusual message on my
[2:24] heart and I would like to have just as
[2:27] little movement as possible and if you
[2:30] just give me your full and undivided
[2:33] attention in Isaiah 53 I'm going to read
[2:36] only five verses starting with verse
[2:39] one who hath believed our report and to
[2:42] whom is the arm of the Lord
[2:44] revealed for he shall grow up before him
[2:47] as a tender plant and as a root out of
[2:50] dry ground he hath no form nor cess and
[2:55] when we shall see him there is no beauty
[2:57] that we should desire him Isaiah the
[3:00] prophet is prophesying of our Lord Jesus
[3:03] Christ of course he is despised and
[3:06] rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and
[3:10] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[3:12] we our faces from him he was despised
[3:16] and we esteemed him not surely he hath
[3:19] borne our griefs and carried our sorrows
[3:23] yet we did esteem him
[3:26] stricken uh smitten of God and afflicted
[3:31] but he was
[3:32] wounded for our
[3:35] transgressions he was bruised for our
[3:37] iniquities and the chastisement of our
[3:40] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[3:44] we are healed God bless his word as you
[3:47] have your
[3:53] seats one of the most striking
[3:57] statements that I've pondered
[4:00] so much that brother Branham has
[4:04] spoken uh when he preached the
[4:06] Masterpiece
[4:08] message he said concerning uh
[4:11] Michelangelo and his uh his statue or
[4:15] his uh work artwork of
[4:19] Moses and he
[4:21] said he struck it and he made a flaw on
[4:25] it he said in it and it made a flaw on
[4:29] it
[4:30] it put a flaw on the
[4:34] image he said to me the
[4:38] flaw was what made it the
[4:42] Masterpiece that takes a great deal of
[4:45] thought that's a very deep statement
[4:48] that the flaw made the
[4:52] Masterpiece I want to speak to you with
[4:54] God's help on the value of the flaw
[5:05] a flaw
[5:07] is to do physical
[5:10] harm to
[5:13] impair to deface or def figure
[5:17] disfigure perhaps to blemish that's a
[5:20] mar but a flaw is a
[5:24] defect it's a
[5:26] fault it's an imperfection
[5:30] it can be a physical
[5:32] disfigurement that prevents something
[5:35] from being totally perfect and distracts
[5:39] from its value that's what we know as
[5:43] being a flaw or a mar something's
[5:47] marred
[5:49] Michelangelo he marred
[5:51] his uh his great statue which he had
[5:56] made I was very moved as brother
[6:01] Ryan opened the
[6:03] service with a Blessed Assurance because
[6:07] this is the first thing I was going to
[6:11] show you I want to show you the
[6:14] author of
[6:16] uh that song
[6:32] would you give me the first one
[6:35] that there could we dim the lights a we
[6:38] bit also
[6:41] please
[6:45] uh the scripture was written and I will
[6:49] I will bring the Blind by a way that
[6:52] they knew knew not I will lead them in
[6:55] paths that they have not known I will
[6:58] make Darkness light before them and
[7:01] crooked things straight these things
[7:03] will I do unto them and not forsake
[7:07] them we have here a couple pictures
[7:12] of Fanny Crosby brother Brown referred
[7:15] to her many
[7:16] times born in 1820 and died in
[7:22] 1915 about her
[7:24] blindness she
[7:28] said it seems seemed
[7:33] intended it seemed intended by the
[7:35] Blessed Providence of God that I should
[7:38] be blind all my life and I thank him for
[7:42] the the
[7:43] dispensation if perfect Earthly sight
[7:46] were offered me to
[7:48] tomorrow I would not accept it I might
[7:52] not have sung hymns to the praise of God
[7:56] if I had been distracted by the
[7:58] Beautiful and interesting things about
[8:02] me she was asked by uh and spoken to by
[8:06] a a
[8:08] minister and who said to her it's it's
[8:11] it's really sad that uh you haven't got
[8:14] your sight such a gifted intelligent
[8:17] person perhaps you would have uh been
[8:21] been able to express so many other
[8:23] things and she quickly responded that if
[8:27] I were offered sight right now I would
[8:30] refuse it because she
[8:36] said the first
[8:38] thing I want to see is the face of my
[8:44] savior and she wrote the song I shall
[8:46] know him I shall know him by the prince
[8:51] of the nails in his
[8:53] hands I can say that she certainly had a
[8:58] flaw in life but she used it for the
[9:01] glory of God she didn't wallow in in it
[9:05] she didn't wallow in the ground she
[9:07] didn't allow her life to become a burden
[9:10] to others she rather she gave glory to
[9:14] God and has blessed centuries of
[9:21] people wrote over 8,000 songs
[9:30] when Fanny died her tombstone carried
[9:33] the words Aunt Fanny
[9:39] and Blessed
[9:42] assurance Jesus is
[9:45] mine oh what a
[9:47] foretaste of Glory
[9:51] Divine I say that
[9:54] she
[9:56] indeed increased the value of the law
[10:00] she could have just been blind but she
[10:02] increased the value she accepted it she
[10:06] in increased the value of it and we may
[10:10] not have that kind of
[10:14] extreme uh example of a flaw in our
[10:19] lives but I'm I want you to sit close
[10:22] and sit quiet I'm going to come home to
[10:24] your
[10:26] address and God has laid this I have
[10:28] never spoken
[10:30] such a
[10:31] subject but it is forever who whoever is
[10:34] here you may have thought you came as a
[10:36] visitor this is for
[10:38] you you say I well I come here all the
[10:42] time I'm a member here this is for you
[10:44] you may be streaming and you say uh well
[10:47] I'm I'm streaming and I always stream
[10:49] but I want you to listen to this service
[10:52] differently this is for
[10:55] you I won't take the time to to read the
[10:59] beautiful beautiful poem that was read
[11:01] at her
[11:02] funeral but it just started out by
[11:05] saying way to the country of sunshine
[11:07] and song our Songbird has taken her
[11:11] flight and she who has sung in the
[11:14] darkest so long now sings in the
[11:19] beautiful
[11:20] light brother brandham said about her
[11:23] the reason I respect blind Fanny Crosby
[11:27] she never sold her gift out to the world
[11:30] she kept it with God my old blind Fanny
[11:34] Crosby had never seen in her life but
[11:37] she screamed pass me not oh gentle
[11:41] savior hear my humble
[11:43] cry while on others Thou Art calling do
[11:48] not pass me
[11:52] by Moses had a
[11:56] flaw the prophet said that all the
[11:58] prophet had
[12:01] flaws and we all have
[12:09] flaws he spoke about Abraham and Isaac
[12:14] and Jacob and
[12:16] Joseph you can turn the lights back on
[12:19] now if you would
[12:20] please being the foundation corners of
[12:24] the great rock that the new masterpiece
[12:28] Jesus Christ would be built
[12:31] on and he said Joseph's life was
[12:35] perfect but he said he had a scratch
[12:39] there was just a
[12:40] scratch and the scratch was he said to
[12:43] his parents his father rather and his
[12:45] brothers when you come do not into Egypt
[12:49] do not say that you're that you're
[12:52] Shepherds because that's a uh that's
[12:55] looked down on so say something that
[12:59] you're herders or that you're herdsmen
[13:01] or something but you're not Shepherds
[13:04] but when they came and his father came
[13:06] and Pharaoh asked them what are you he
[13:09] said we're
[13:10] Shepherds he said that was a scratch
[13:14] even in Joseph's
[13:16] life uh and you may sit in life you may
[13:20] be sitting here today and saying
[13:22] everything's going fine and everything's
[13:24] wonderful and and young people whose
[13:26] lives are perhaps Carefree well let me
[13:29] just say this that you don't live very
[13:31] long before you feel a
[13:37] scratch and my message today really has
[13:40] and I feel a real urgency and I feel
[13:43] stirred a message thrusting through me
[13:47] that it's it's what you do with the
[13:51] flaw amen what you do with it and there
[13:55] are different ways that it comes
[13:58] sometimes times it can be uh something
[14:02] direct that God actually does for
[14:05] example uh the the this masterpiece
[14:08] message actually has its commencement
[14:11] with with Adam being in the image of God
[14:15] and God directly wounded him and took
[14:19] Eve from him and that was the Mar in in
[14:24] in Adam but it it had to have that in
[14:27] order to achieve a bride and a wife for
[14:30] him and Christ was marred and at at
[14:34] Calvary that the Bride of Jesus Christ
[14:37] would have a life
[14:39] amen but
[14:42] Moses he had a flaw sometimes it can be
[14:46] something not that God does directly but
[14:49] something that God
[14:50] allows he may allow it a very very bad
[14:55] thing can happen very evil in your from
[14:57] your perspective can happen but maybe
[15:01] but God often allows it to happen and
[15:05] then we can ask why has God allowed this
[15:07] to happen there is a positive spin to it
[15:11] and if you're not careful you'll take
[15:13] the negative side because Satan is
[15:15] inspiring the negative side and he wants
[15:18] you to think about the negative part of
[15:20] it and the negative part of it can make
[15:22] a person
[15:25] embittered can make them
[15:27] angry can put a very negative twist in
[15:30] their life and and and rench them out
[15:34] inside and they live a life far below
[15:38] where they should as a son and daughter
[15:40] of God and then there's a third one and
[15:42] that is
[15:44] self-inflicted we do
[15:47] things and we are so filled with regret
[15:50] and remorse and repentance and and on
[15:53] and on remember you must deal with those
[15:56] things according to the scripture if you
[15:59] do wrong you repent you you you you must
[16:02] deal with the flaw you must deal with
[16:05] that self-inflicted wound so that God
[16:08] even can take it and and use you as a
[16:11] result of it this is what I'm going to
[16:13] be speaking about and I know we all have
[16:16] it and furthermore I want you to I want
[16:19] you to take and absorb this service this
[16:22] morning and apply it into that area of
[16:25] your life and if you can't apply it as
[16:27] of right now probably next week or next
[16:30] month or who who knows when you will be
[16:32] able to apply
[16:34] it the Bible says of Moses when God
[16:37] begin to speak to him and Moses said to
[16:40] the Lord my oh my
[16:42] Lord I am not
[16:45] eloquent neither here to for not since
[16:49] thou Hast spoken unto thy servant but I
[16:52] am of slow speech I want you to hear
[16:55] this I'm going to dwell on that a moment
[16:57] I'm of slow speech spe and of a slow
[17:00] tongue and the Lord said who's made the
[17:03] mouth who's made the dumb or deaf or the
[17:07] seeing or the blind have not I the
[17:13] Lord and the slow the word in the Hebrew
[17:16] is to be of heavy to be weighty words to
[17:20] be Grievous
[17:22] words difficult and burdensome and even
[17:25] very oppressive he wasn't eloquent he
[17:29] didn't know how to say it he just said
[17:31] it straight out and straightforward and
[17:33] and perhaps his his language was
[17:35] burdensome and it came across oppressive
[17:38] do you know what so multitude say
[17:40] concerning the prophet's message it's so
[17:42] judgmental it's so hard he's always
[17:45] stripping us
[17:49] down I'll give you two signs like Moses
[17:53] but maybe he also that's why brother
[17:55] Bram said I'm not educated I can't
[17:58] preach like these men can preach I I
[18:00] don't have the education it was a burden
[18:03] to him but it did not prevent him from
[18:06] saying thus says the
[18:09] Lord it did not prevent him from
[18:13] receiving and hearing the word of God
[18:15] for you for this
[18:18] generation and he never rided himself of
[18:21] that flaw with his H and his K and all
[18:24] the all the grammar of the self he still
[18:27] remembered a still remained a seventh
[18:29] grade educated boy from Kentucky who
[18:33] didn't have any
[18:35] friends he also
[18:39] carried all through his life because I
[18:41] was with him when he was 52 and
[18:44] 53 one day he just turned to me quickly
[18:47] because his daddy was an
[18:50] alcoholic his daddy was a uh a boot
[18:54] leer and produced
[18:57] liquor and brother was actually carrying
[19:01] the water from the for the still when
[19:03] the wind came into the trees and he
[19:06] heard the
[19:07] voice speaking to him but he had that
[19:11] flaw all his
[19:13] life and his parents were
[19:15] Catholics and as I said to brother
[19:18] Eugene and sister Gina he said I didn't
[19:21] have a religious home perhaps if I had
[19:23] I'd been further down the road and more
[19:25] souls may have been saved Hallelujah
[19:29] yeah he had a
[19:32] flaw and he carried it all his life he
[19:36] said to me one day quickly he said
[19:39] brother
[19:40] Eddie my daddy was a
[19:44] alcoholic but he said if you ask me
[19:46] right now we were standing in the motel
[19:49] room he said if you ask me right now if
[19:52] there was gold bricks stacked from the
[19:55] floor to the ceiling of this room he
[19:58] said if you ask me what I would pre
[20:00] sooner have that pile of gold
[20:04] bricks or 5 minutes with my daddy he
[20:08] said I'd take the five minutes with my
[20:11] daddy so it was worth hundreds of
[20:14] millions of dollars for him to be able
[20:16] to have five minutes with his
[20:19] daddy I say that's a person that made
[20:22] the best of the
[20:24] flaw and had his daddy die in his arms
[20:27] and was able to pray for for him and
[20:29] pray with him and see his mother
[20:33] converted he took a flaw of a Catholic
[20:36] Family and turned the thing
[20:39] around nothing is impossible with
[20:42] [Applause]
[20:46] [Music]
[20:47] God I thought of David I just added this
[20:50] this
[20:51] morning it was in my mind cuz I can see
[20:53] it all through the scripture but I'm
[20:55] just wondering which one I should pick
[20:58] and I thought of
[21:00] David and it's described in in
[21:05] Samuel and he wanted to build a house
[21:07] for the Lord and he wanted to do so many
[21:09] things and he had it in his
[21:14] heart and God sent Nathan and spoke to
[21:19] him this is after he had taken Uriah
[21:22] taking uriah's wife bath
[21:25] Sheba he said wherefore hast thou
[21:28] despised the Commandment of the Lord to
[21:30] do evil in his sight thou has killed
[21:33] Uriah the hittite with the sword and has
[21:37] taken his wife to be thy wife and has
[21:40] slain him with the sword of the children
[21:43] of Ammon now therefore the sword shall
[21:47] never depart from thine
[21:50] house because thou Hast despised me and
[21:54] has taken the wife of UAH the hittite to
[21:58] be the thy wife thus sayith the Lord
[22:01] behold I will raise up evil against thee
[22:03] out of thine own house and I will take
[22:06] thy wives before thine eyes and give
[22:09] them unto thy neighbor and he shall lie
[22:11] with thy wives in the sight of this son
[22:15] for thou did it secretly but I will do
[22:17] this thing before all Israel and before
[22:20] the
[22:21] son you might say this would be a
[22:25] hopeless situation he took and had had a
[22:28] man killed so that he could have his
[22:30] wife and he needed to do so because she
[22:32] was already carrying David's child and
[22:36] God said he'll he'll
[22:38] die you talk about a
[22:41] flaw you talk about a a AAR in a
[22:45] person's life but God never took away
[22:49] the fact that he would still be
[22:51] king God never took away from him that
[22:54] his his praises and and and and God saw
[22:58] what he would do with the flaw he
[23:01] accepted it he accepted God's sentence
[23:04] and he said in the Psalms where his
[23:06] worshiping let my sentence come from
[23:09] your
[23:11] presence don't let it come from some man
[23:15] or a group of men but let my sentence
[23:18] whatever it is let it come from your
[23:21] presence and God so loved him and he
[23:25] took his flaw and wrote some of the most
[23:28] glorious
[23:29] verses in the scripture and prophesied
[23:31] of Jesus Christ and reflected Jesus
[23:34] Christ in his life and don't ask me how
[23:37] where or how this happens and through
[23:40] that woman B she becomes Solomon God
[23:44] even allowed because God knew what he
[23:47] would do with that flaw he accepted it
[23:50] he didn't get bitter against God he
[23:52] didn't question God he received it
[23:58] it's not whatever will be will be no it
[24:02] is taking it and and and putting it in a
[24:05] in a in a different uh you put it in a
[24:08] different environment and say I accept
[24:11] the sentence of God I accept the word of
[24:13] God I accept the Forgiveness of God I
[24:16] accept it and I will give my life as a
[24:19] sacrifice to God and let him do whatever
[24:22] he wishes with me
[24:30] the tell the scripture tells us in in
[24:33] the book of Acts when the apostles were
[24:35] filled with the Holy Ghost and when they
[24:37] heard these things they were cut to the
[24:40] heart I'm going to be going back and
[24:42] forth but you'll follow the theme they
[24:44] were cut to the heart and they nashed on
[24:47] him with their teeth and that was after
[24:51] a a 30 second message that Peter gave
[24:54] also when they heard when they heard
[24:57] that they were cut to the heart and took
[25:00] counsel to slay them Peter had preached
[25:03] and I counted it I read it myself like
[25:06] preaching and it is no more not even
[25:09] quite a 30 second
[25:12] sermon and I thought I should read that
[25:15] sermon but I won't even take the 30
[25:17] seconds but you know who was sitting
[25:19] there was
[25:21] gel the the instructor and teacher of
[25:24] apostle Paul was sitting listening to
[25:27] this 302 message and when they said
[25:29] let's slay these people gel stood up
[25:33] after hearing a 30-second message and he
[25:35] said let it let us not do this kind of
[25:38] thing we can't fight God and he turned
[25:41] and his his speaking convinced the
[25:43] people to turn away from killing these
[25:46] men but why did they arise with such a
[25:50] an anger why did they have to spill out
[25:52] so much evil upon them because they were
[25:54] cut to the
[25:56] heart it was the truth that cut them to
[25:59] the heart these were like the words of
[26:01] Moses coming heavy and Grievous and
[26:05] oppressive we don't want to hear these
[26:08] things we don't want to hear we can't
[26:10] cut our hair we don't want to hear how
[26:12] we ought to dress we don't want to hear
[26:14] how we should live and what we should
[26:16] see in our homes and the kind of
[26:18] material we don't want to hear that this
[26:20] is too oppressive it's thus say the
[26:25] word and we receive those
[26:28] Grievous words and say this is God
[26:32] speaking I need this and I will benefit
[26:35] as I I receive
[26:39] it it was a burden to the apostles to
[26:43] have to speak that way brother brandham
[26:47] had to say I don't I don't hate the
[26:52] sisters we love them I'm trying to help
[26:56] them but it was a burden in his
[27:00] life and he was identified as a woman
[27:03] hater right he was identified as being
[27:07] all kinds of things and the message is
[27:10] still identified that
[27:16] way and you can accept that rather than
[27:20] trying to smooth it
[27:24] out Apostle Paul's great teacher he was
[27:27] a ected by that 302nd sermon and talk
[27:32] those religious leaders out of killing
[27:35] the apostles and when when the scripture
[27:38] says in the Greek they were cut to the
[27:40] heart it was that they were just like sa
[27:43] a Sunder to be swn through mentally and
[27:47] and and to be to be ranked and torn with
[27:50] vexation this wasn't something light
[27:52] friends right this was something that
[27:55] were having an incredible effect upon
[27:57] people people but the
[28:00] apostles it is like they were looked
[28:03] upon as having a mar having uh that they
[28:07] were
[28:08] identified as being ignorant
[28:12] men raw to the point saying it they
[28:16] couldn't put the message in a in a nice
[28:19] framework is had to tell it the way it
[28:22] was amen we still need
[28:26] it and then when
[28:29] Jesus was speaking he said many
[28:32] therefore of his disciples these were
[28:35] believers who had professed to believe
[28:38] on him they were in
[28:40] church he said many therefore of his
[28:43] disciples when they heard this saying or
[28:46] rather heard this said this is a hard
[28:51] saying who can hear it brother brandham
[28:54] says in Jehovah Gyra the trouble of it
[28:56] is we have got so much Hollywood
[28:59] preaching and not enough oldtime rough
[29:02] preaching I like the oldtime kind that
[29:05] really tears the he offer you brings it
[29:08] down to a place where it belongs too
[29:10] much petting around we need the
[29:12] oldfashioned gospel preached in its
[29:15] power of the resurrection of the Lord
[29:18] Jesus that's what the world needs today
[29:22] how many here can say Amen to
[29:24] that Hallelujah
[29:28] but for saying those things he was
[29:31] despised it is Jesus Christ that's still
[29:35] being despised and
[29:39] rejected he said God doesn't need
[29:43] compromisers God doesn't want his church
[29:45] to look like the world he doesn't want
[29:47] it to act like the world he doesn't want
[29:50] it to have anything to do with the world
[29:52] only to preach the gospel to the world
[29:54] and to call those forth God wants
[29:57] separators amen the church wants mixers
[30:00] they want a pastor who will not be so
[30:02] hard on them and tell them good things
[30:05] and not dig right down just rake the
[30:08] hide off of them brother that's what we
[30:11] need and in this day this is the thing
[30:14] we have to be so concerned about because
[30:16] everything around us our entire
[30:18] environment and the prophet said that
[30:20] the pressure of this great age is soft
[30:24] living it can be
[30:26] dangerous am amen so if you have it use
[30:31] it for God's kingdom amen whatever it
[30:36] might be I say soft living is a flaw on
[30:39] this generation soft living is
[30:41] disfiguring this
[30:43] generation and I believe whatever
[30:45] generation we are raised in we can take
[30:48] that and use it for the glory of God you
[30:51] got a home use it for God's glory use it
[30:54] for Hospitality you got a car use it
[30:57] when believe Bel have need whatever it
[31:00] is use it for the glory of God be
[31:03] faithful to the house of God be faithful
[31:06] with your
[31:09] testimony so I say once again repeating
[31:12] there are different aspects of wounding
[31:15] or to Mar or to cause a
[31:18] flaw I remind you again some are allowed
[31:21] by God and some are brought Upon Us by
[31:23] other people or
[31:25] circumstances and some are
[31:27] self-inflicted
[31:31] some are the results of
[31:37] nature Fanny Crosby born
[31:41] blind I looked at others there were
[31:43] great people I won't even talk about
[31:45] them Einstein couldn't hardly
[31:47] write much of his life very intelligent
[31:51] people Steven Hawking I saw him here in
[31:55] Vancouver trying to speak through his
[31:58] computer uh dying with lugar's disease
[32:01] as it were and yet one of the most
[32:04] Brilliant Minds if you saw his twisted
[32:06] up just such a hopeless helpless sight
[32:12] twisted up being wheeled in a wheelchair
[32:16] and and and with this motorized chair I
[32:19] should say and and speaking one word and
[32:22] then another word and another word and
[32:24] taking questions from the taking
[32:26] questions from the
[32:28] people several hundreds of people are
[32:30] there and yet the eyes of the world are
[32:32] on him because he has the most brilliant
[32:34] mind I guess since
[32:37] Einstein I would say that not for Christ
[32:41] necessarily I don't know what his belief
[32:43] is but he has not allowed that Dreadful
[32:48] flaw and disfigurement in his life to
[32:51] hinder him from what was driving inside
[32:55] listen to me friends we have something
[32:57] inside if we're a Believer you have
[32:59] Christ inside and now we need to listen
[33:02] to the inner mind and let the Inner Man
[33:04] motivate us and drive
[33:06] [Applause]
[33:08] us Amen to be a tool and a vessel for
[33:11] the kingdom not for this
[33:14] world don't serve this world it's all
[33:17] passing
[33:18] away serve it to live serve it to
[33:21] provide for your family serve it to pay
[33:23] your bills and do what you ever need to
[33:25] do but don't sacrifice the House of God
[33:28] don't sacrifice your spiritual life
[33:31] before
[33:34] Christ
[33:41] amen Jesus
[33:44] said as he was coming to the
[33:48] Maring as he was coming now to be so
[33:52] brutalized that his Visage would be
[33:55] marred more than that of any man can you
[33:57] believe that brother brandom describes
[34:00] it and I tell you you want to have a
[34:02] strong
[34:05] stomach but he said no man taketh
[34:08] speaking of his life taketh it from me
[34:11] but I lay it down with myself I have
[34:14] power to lay it down and I have power to
[34:17] take it again and this commandment I
[34:20] have received of my
[34:22] father the scripture says God gave his
[34:25] son Jesus La his own life down and yet
[34:29] men crucified him so this is one where
[34:33] God and even brother brandham says God
[34:35] smote
[34:37] him but actually in human form it was
[34:41] men that smot him but God was allowing
[34:44] them to Smite him God was allowing man
[34:47] to make the mar but God was actually
[34:49] responsible for the mar God gave his
[34:53] son now hold it close
[34:58] men thrust the thorns on his brow men
[35:01] drove the nails in his feet and
[35:05] hands but God gave him to be the
[35:08] sacrifice so God arranged
[35:11] it and this
[35:14] flaw this
[35:16] Mar was not something that Jesus ran
[35:19] from he ran to
[35:23] it he'd be despised of men and
[35:27] considered Smitten by
[35:30] God but out of the
[35:33] flaw yes
[35:35] sir came a
[35:37] voice out of the flaw came the blood
[35:41] that speaks better things than that of
[35:46] AEL and the prophet he dwells on it so
[35:49] much that when
[35:51] Michelangelo was finished with his his
[35:54] statue and His image of of Moses
[35:58] he said it was so perfect when he saw
[36:01] the image that he had in his mind and he
[36:04] said he worked for years and he labored
[36:06] for years and spent such a large part of
[36:08] his life and he saw it in his mind and
[36:11] all it was was a a block it was just a a
[36:14] piece of stone but in the stone he saw
[36:16] an image he saw Moses in the stone and
[36:20] when he finally had it done and had it
[36:23] polished and and touched up here and
[36:25] there and and and and he thought that it
[36:27] was so real it must speak and he took
[36:29] his hammer and struck the knee and said
[36:34] speak and brother Benham ties that over
[36:36] to Calvary when he finally saw an image
[36:39] here on Earth
[36:41] hallelujah oh stay with me now please
[36:45] when he saw the image here on Earth he
[36:47] he he he he didn't only desire a son he
[36:50] desired a
[36:52] family he desired a relationship that
[36:55] would be that of husband and wife
[37:03] and you that have not experienced
[37:04] husband and wife relationship let me
[37:06] tell you the relationship that the Lord
[37:09] Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost will take
[37:12] you into will supersede the husband wife
[37:15] human
[37:19] relationship it can supersede it yes do
[37:23] you believe that not just because I'm
[37:26] preaching it but if you can say that it
[37:30] supersedes it
[37:33] amen God was looking up beyond the
[37:36] physical frame he was looking beyond the
[37:39] physical when he said this is my beloved
[37:42] Son in whom I'm well pleased but when he
[37:46] led and he led that son the the the the
[37:51] dove leading the lamb and led him up to
[37:54] Calvary and beaten and and blooded and
[37:59] finally he comes to Calvary and men who
[38:02] are breathing God's
[38:05] air who have ate God's
[38:08] food who God gives strength in their
[38:12] muscles and they're the ones with the
[38:14] hammer and drove the spikes and the one
[38:17] that took the spear and thrust his side
[38:21] I've said it before and perhaps you
[38:22] can't understand it he did us a favor
[38:27] even the cruel Roman soldier did us a
[38:30] favor when he thrusted his side and out
[38:33] came blood and water but the prophet
[38:35] said of King
[38:39] Spirit the only spirit that can mingle
[38:43] with your
[38:48] spirit for the first time in history and
[38:51] the last time in history that's right
[38:53] came out a
[38:55] spirit out of a broken blood cell he
[39:00] said the blood cell was broken and only
[39:03] that Spirit could come into your spirit
[39:06] Hallelujah and make you a new creature
[39:08] in Christ
[39:11] Jesus Hallelujah but the prophet said
[39:13] you'll still have the sticky
[39:16] nature and that's what I want to deal
[39:18] with as I go along you'll still have the
[39:21] sticky
[39:22] nature I say you might as well accept it
[39:26] there's people who spend their entire
[39:28] life trying to get rid of it trying to
[39:30] get rid of it I'm not talking about
[39:32] sinful things I'm talking about the the
[39:35] sticky nature
[39:37] right right God knew you'd be born in a
[39:41] natural
[39:43] birth God knew every footstep that you
[39:46] take and some of you come from good
[39:49] homes and some come from very
[39:52] dysfunctional
[39:54] homes and some come from very sad
[39:56] situations
[40:03] and it's fine for me to go back back in
[40:05] the
[40:08] Bible and I've given some of my own
[40:10] testimony brother brandham often told
[40:12] his life
[40:14] story and he told it in minute detail
[40:28] sister Debbie Kye I spoke to your
[40:32] husband years
[40:34] ago sister Debbie as many years ago I
[40:38] couldn't even recall all the details I
[40:40] won't go into all the
[40:43] details but her and her sister there was
[40:47] a number of children I think another
[40:49] four maybe about
[40:51] six
[40:53] children in a home with an alcoholic
[40:55] mother and alcoholic father
[40:57] father and the children are put out into
[41:00] foster
[41:02] homes and the whole family is
[41:04] essentially dis
[41:06] abandoned and she talked with me and
[41:08] said I I want to make contact with my
[41:12] family and we've been separated all
[41:15] these years and certain members of the
[41:18] family and and she was so burdened I
[41:20] could see she was just so
[41:24] crushed now that sister sits here I'm
[41:27] not talking about 3,000 years ago 4,000
[41:30] years ago and every one of you here have
[41:35] something that you're
[41:40] carrying and you wish it could be
[41:43] different and I'm going to say take the
[41:46] situation where you
[41:48] are and where you find
[41:51] yourself and say
[41:53] God I give it to
[41:56] you I will not surrender up any of my
[42:00] spiritual Christian standards or walk
[42:03] let my sentence come from your presence
[42:06] but I will I give it to you I will not
[42:09] let it intimidate me I will not let it
[42:12] stand in my way I give it to you
[42:15] whatever that thing is whatever whatever
[42:18] arrangement I came out of and I saw that
[42:21] sister Debbie was so burdened and
[42:25] crushed over this and and when do you
[42:27] think it goes away it doesn't go
[42:30] away you think about it at night you
[42:32] think about it when you lay down in bed
[42:33] you think about it while you're working
[42:35] while you're busy while you're active
[42:37] while you're doing things you're
[42:38] thinking about it it's always there
[42:41] because it's
[42:43] you not talking about what's in your
[42:45] nature I'm talking about
[42:47] circumstances and the circumstances may
[42:50] be those that you didn't were were
[42:52] imposed upon you there may be others
[42:54] that were self-inflicted choice that you
[42:57] made uh we have David's case we have
[43:00] other cases in the scripture which it
[43:02] was not the people's fault they were
[43:04] birthed into
[43:06] it wasn't sister Debbie's fault mother
[43:09] and father are both alcoholics she had
[43:11] nothing to do with the fact that they
[43:13] went out to foster homes different
[43:15] foster homes and she doesn't have
[43:17] contact and now she comes into the
[43:19] message and she wishes that they they
[43:21] can hear the same gospel she
[43:25] hears to make a long story short and I
[43:28] won't go into it just a year or so ago I
[43:31] was able to meet sister
[43:34] Debbie her sister older sister and her
[43:39] husband and both have come into the
[43:43] message I want to pass a bouquet to
[43:47] brother Mike and sister
[43:49] Debbie and it never has entered my
[43:52] mind it has never come my mind but as I
[43:55] was studying and I put it down and
[43:57] Debbie your your name came up and then I
[44:00] pushed it away and then it came up again
[44:02] I pushed it away and it came up and so I
[44:05] felt I have to say something and then it
[44:08] seemed that the Holy Spirit spoke to me
[44:10] and said she took a flaw she took a mar
[44:12] she took the burden uh oppressive
[44:15] condition from her life but didn't let
[44:18] it
[44:19] affect her spiritual walk and her
[44:22] service to God and God has brought now
[44:25] the older sister and her husband and it
[44:28] just seemed like the holy spirit said to
[44:30] me they they SST say that the world is a
[44:34] that the universe is expanding and for
[44:37] the first time I thought maybe that is
[44:39] right because as people are birthed into
[44:41] the family of God he throws another
[44:44] world out there or another 10,000
[44:47] worlds and I said God bless you Sister
[44:50] Debbie 20,000 planets went into space
[44:54] when they went into into God's Kingdom
[44:57] Hallelujah why
[44:59] not the prophet said one soul is worth
[45:02] 10,000
[45:04] worlds that's not some poetic language
[45:07] that's the
[45:09] truth I'm here today to declare you live
[45:12] your life for God regardless of your
[45:15] past or regardless of what you suffered
[45:17] or regardless of your situation don't
[45:19] let Satan poke anything down that memory
[45:25] Channel amen amen
[45:27] [Applause]
[45:28] hallelujah
[45:31] hallelujah if I was standing
[45:35] here now I'm bringing it
[45:38] home and you knew me to have slept with
[45:41] a
[45:46] woman and that she bore a child as a
[45:48] result of
[45:51] it and God killed that child
[45:58] I don't think you would want me to be a
[46:01] pastor I don't think you'd want to hear
[46:03] me
[46:06] speak because your eyes would be on the
[46:12] floor and David could have just kept in
[46:15] looking at the flaw as well and saying
[46:18] look what's happened to my life I I've
[46:20] ruined it I'm I I I'm good for
[46:24] nothing God still saw him as one of the
[46:27] the greatest Kings of the Bible and he
[46:29] wouldn't change
[46:31] it I'm not suggesting that I have
[46:33] committed such a sin I can in fact say
[46:35] I've been I've been true and I've lived
[46:37] a clean pristine life and the only woman
[46:40] I've known is my wife I say that for the
[46:43] glory of God but let me say this this
[46:45] might not be the testimony of other
[46:47] people but I am no purer than you and
[46:50] you're and and brother brandham is no
[46:52] purer than anybody the blood of Jesus
[46:54] Christ cleanses and Braes every
[47:00] transgression so to you that may have
[47:03] self-inflicted wounds let me tell you
[47:06] that the that the Christ of this gospel
[47:11] erases and the prophet furthermore says
[47:14] that when your confessed sin drops into
[47:17] the blach he said it actually becomes
[47:24] BL that's beyond our compr
[47:29] hension and then there are others that
[47:31] are imposed upon you it wasn't sister
[47:35] Debbie that chose my parents should be
[47:37] alcoholics it wasn't you that chose that
[47:40] your situation would be what it is some
[47:42] of your single parents it wasn't you
[47:44] that chose your husband or wife would
[47:46] depart you and leave you it wasn't you
[47:48] that chose certain things would be a
[47:50] certain way I'm saying if the reason why
[47:54] God hear me good now the reason why God
[47:57] so loved David it was because God could
[48:01] set his sentence on his act and David
[48:04] would accept it but he would say this
[48:07] will not hinder me I will not let this
[48:10] impair my love for
[48:14] God hallelujah I will not let it stand
[48:17] in my
[48:19] way and that was so
[48:22] complete that God allowed and
[48:25] predetermined that B Sheba would bring
[48:27] forth
[48:30] Solomon who was a type of Jesus Christ
[48:34] and under Solomon he the prophet said
[48:36] Israel essentially had a
[48:41] millennium amen that kind of God we
[48:46] don't know very much about that's
[48:50] right
[48:52] yes in case anybody thinks you don't
[48:55] have a flaw yeah
[48:58] don't don't be too self
[49:01] assured for when the scratch
[49:04] comes when the flaw
[49:07] comes how I thank God for clean lives
[49:11] and how I thank God for lives that
[49:13] haven't like brother BR said I might
[49:15] have been further down the
[49:20] road I just want to say I don't care
[49:23] what has happened in your life I don't
[49:25] care where you came came
[49:28] from the God that I serve and the god
[49:31] that is present here today knows
[49:34] precisely your situation he knows what
[49:36] has caused it what has created it he has
[49:39] watched you every step you've taken and
[49:42] he is saying right here this morning
[49:45] through my lips that you turn your life
[49:48] you give what you have to him that's all
[49:50] he
[49:52] wants he's not wanting a bunch of bunch
[49:54] of Works he doesn't need a bunch of
[49:56] things so you he can justify you he just
[49:58] wants you to surrender your life the
[50:01] talents that he's given you the gifts
[50:03] that he's given you just turn them back
[50:04] to
[50:06] God whatever you do don't be reduced to
[50:09] a
[50:10] [Applause]
[50:11] churchgoer whatever you do don't merely
[50:14] become
[50:15] religious whatever you do are you
[50:17] hearing me don't turn this message into
[50:20] a
[50:21] tradition oh now we're so happy we're
[50:24] Believers that we just live nice little
[50:26] lives and go to church and so on don't
[50:28] do that say Here I Am Speak Lord what do
[50:32] you want me to do what do you want me to
[50:36] be and don't forget this
[50:39] message amen
[50:45] amen
[50:48] flaws and then in the beginning was the
[50:50] word and the Word was with God and the
[50:53] Word was hewed out
[50:56] and reflected what the word was at the
[50:59] beginning
[51:00] himy the word reflected in the
[51:03] Masterpiece in his own likeness God back
[51:07] again in his own
[51:08] likeness the word form being reflected
[51:12] in the image of a man the
[51:16] Masterpiece and he said all prophets had
[51:20] flaws

[51:57] the Father the word now in flesh and a
[52:01] voice
[52:02] spoke this is my
[52:05] son in whom I'm pleased and on Mount
[52:10] Transfiguration a cloud covered him and
[52:12] a voice this is my son hear ye him
[52:16] amen but the prophet I'm so thankful for
[52:19] the message the prophet said that when
[52:22] uh when Michelangelo and he's he's
[52:24] bringing it right up to the present time
[52:26] when he saw the sun when he saw his
[52:29] image and when God saw his image because
[52:31] say there was something he saw on
[52:33] Calvary that he didn't see while Jesus
[52:36] was walking and coming out of the water
[52:39] he saw something on Calvary and the
[52:42] prophet is bringing to it so clear and
[52:44] he takes a hammer and now God is
[52:46] allowing it and struck the image and
[52:50] when the image was struck the blood cell
[52:54] of God
[52:56] the the the beginning of the new
[52:58] creation please grasp this the image the
[53:02] beginning of the new creation the blood
[53:05] cell that had been in the womb of Mary
[53:08] Hallelujah which was a creation of God
[53:11] the beginning of a new creation the
[53:14] blood cell broke and God saw his
[53:19] family God saw
[53:22] you I can prove it to you hallah he
[53:26] asked through he asked through Isaiah

[53:37] household the heavens my hand is made
[53:40] the Earth is my foot stol but where's
[53:42] the house that you build me not a
[53:46] building not Cedar not Stones where's
[53:49] the house you look at in the Hebrew
[53:51] where's my household where's my children
[53:53] where's my sons where's my wife where's
[53:56] my
[53:59] household where's this kind of
[54:01] relationship God doesn't need gold he
[54:04] doesn't need silver he doesn't need your
[54:05] offering he doesn't need your tithe he
[54:08] doesn't need anything he just wants
[54:11] you he wants that Spirit that's in you
[54:15] that his the life from his blood cell
[54:17] came and mingled with your spirit and
[54:20] made you a son and daughter of
[54:24] God and that life is so
[54:27] powerful it can control the sticky
[54:31] [Music]
[54:34] nature hallelujah hallelujah
[54:38] hallelujah I've got something you've got
[54:40] something greater than your sticky
[54:42] nature
[54:44] amen hallelujah yes sir he said he got
[54:48] so
[54:49] inspired and I just as though I could
[54:52] see God the almighty one all his Focus
[54:57] now is on what's happening on on this
[55:00] Hill Called Mount Calvary go gotha and
[55:04] when he sees and and finding that sun is
[55:08] so battered he saw Isaiah and what he
[55:11] spoke to Isaiah it's all been past all
[55:14] been fulfilled he sees it right before
[55:16] him a lamb a bleeding lamb and it's so
[55:20] perfect because he knows this is the
[55:23] answer and he struck it
[55:26] and Out Come the blood and the spirit
[55:30] the blood went to the earth and the
[55:31] spirit ascended it's a spirit of
[55:35] God to come back into the
[55:38] believer that's why we speak so
[55:40] forcefully on the baptism of the Holy
[55:42] Ghost and you're baptized in the name of
[55:45] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[55:48] and you shall connect the word and you
[55:51] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[55:54] Ghost it's not some manly hands on you
[55:57] and making you to utter some words
[55:59] that's not it it's him who said you be
[56:02] baptized and you shall be filled with
[56:04] the Holy
[56:05] [Applause]
[56:06] [Music]
[56:07] Ghost and you'll have God living inside
[56:11] of a sticky
[56:14] nature and brother Bram was even asked
[56:16] the question when Apostle Paul said when
[56:19] I would do good evil is present with
[56:23] me and what I would do I do not the good
[56:26] that I would do I do not and the evil
[56:29] that I would not I
[56:31] do and a man ask a question and
[56:34] questions and answers he said this I
[56:35] don't
[56:37] understand brother Bram said well it's a
[56:39] cockabur with a wheat seed in
[56:43] [Applause]
[56:47] it
[56:49] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah with
[56:52] wheat life in it but God got so inspired
[56:56] and the prophet kept saying it he struck
[56:58] it and cried
[57:01] speak Jesus didn't say anything but the
[57:04] blood
[57:06] spoke the blood cried out the price is
[57:11] paid the blood Cried Out Redemption is
[57:16] [Applause]
[57:17] complete the blood cried out here is the
[57:21] family here's the family of
[57:24] God and our Propet of God said you were
[57:28] there in him at
[57:31] Calvary do you believe that you were
[57:34] there call your name out say I was
[57:37] there on
[57:39] Calvary Hallelujah when the blood spoke
[57:44] out this is
[57:46] redemption not half not 90% this is
[57:49] redemption
[57:58] you never heard me say what I'm
[58:00] saying if I committed the sins of
[58:04] David you wouldn't want to be
[58:08] here your human reasoning just wouldn't
[58:10] quite allow
[58:13] it but you see you would be I'm ready
[58:16] coming down you would be looking at the
[58:20] flaw not at what you could do with it
[58:33] right and what David did with
[58:36] it he accepted the sentence of
[58:41] God you should read the psalms now after
[58:44] this
[58:46] service it was what he did with it if
[58:49] you focused with what he did with it
[58:51] then you'd understand you might say well
[58:54] we have the Holy Spirit now that's right
[58:57] but we have some of the same
[58:59] flaws we have some of the
[59:04] same
[59:06] weighty
[59:07] burdensome crushing
[59:11] oppressive Mars in our life I've been
[59:14] born this way I've been born in a
[59:17] certain country I've been born with a
[59:18] certain home I've had a mess of my life
[59:23] tell you what God's not looking at them
[59:26] mess he's looking at what he provided to
[59:28] fix
[59:32] it
[59:34] Hallelujah that's why I'm speaking
[59:37] today Jesus said furthermore I have come
[59:42] not those that are not sick they don't
[59:46] need a
[59:49] physician those that are righteous don't
[59:52] need Christ he said I have come I have
[59:56] come for those that are sick those that
[1:00:00] recognize I need a
[1:00:02] savior I need a total
[1:00:05] Redemption I need the life that came out
[1:00:08] I need the blood that speaks better
[1:00:11] things than
[1:00:13] able I need a voice that says you're
[1:00:16] forgiven I need a voice that
[1:00:19] [Applause]
[1:00:20] says lay your life down give me your
[1:00:25] heart
[1:00:34] God got so
[1:00:37] inspired Apostle Paul carried a flaw he
[1:00:40] even mentions
[1:00:43] it he
[1:00:45] said I
[1:00:48] stood when Timothy was being
[1:00:52] martyred and furthermore they laid his
[1:00:55] clothes at my
[1:00:58] feet and I stood there and I never said
[1:01:00] a word against it
[1:01:04] right first church age
[1:01:06] messenger if you look at his flaw you'll
[1:01:10] have a hard time seeing really what he
[1:01:12] achieved in his life and he said I
[1:01:16] blasphemed I was a blasphemer but I did
[1:01:18] it
[1:01:20] [Applause]
[1:01:23] ignorantly I didn't know any better
[1:01:27] that's not
[1:01:29] people I've heard things said about
[1:01:32] Believers and whatever you do with those
[1:01:36] that have found Fellowship elsewhere and
[1:01:38] going elsewhere be careful what you say
[1:01:40] about them leave it in the hands of
[1:01:43] God I've heard things and I said that's
[1:01:46] so close to blasphemy against the Holy
[1:01:50] Spirit on that they walk on such
[1:01:53] Dangerous Ground when we speak about one
[1:01:56] another we speak about how they've lived
[1:02:00] or what has happened to them I can tell
[1:02:02] you one thing a surrendered life God is
[1:02:06] looking at what you will do with thy
[1:02:08] flaw Moses said I can't speak God says
[1:02:11] I'll have you to speak furthermore I'll
[1:02:15] give my whole law to you you'll be the
[1:02:17] first prophet and I'll give your whole
[1:02:20] law and no man will speak with God like
[1:02:22] you're going to like I'm going to speak
[1:02:24] with you
[1:02:26] amen and he came
[1:02:27] down and was the mouthpiece by the Ernie
[1:02:30] of almighty God but it was course it was
[1:02:35] hard he was a slow laborious not slow in
[1:02:39] length of speaking he it was laborious
[1:02:43] and he just had to say it Thou shalt not
[1:02:45] K Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou
[1:02:49] shalt not
[1:02:51] steal and he just laid it out
[1:02:54] there and some of the people could
[1:02:56] handle it and some couldn't that's right
[1:02:59] that did not change his status with God
[1:03:04] your flaw Hallelujah I'm here to say
[1:03:07] your flaw whatever it might be does not
[1:03:11] change your call or your status with God
[1:03:15] can you say Amen to that why don't you
[1:03:17] say Thank you Lord
[1:03:20] Jesus
[1:03:22] [Music]
[1:03:24] Hallelujah and don't spend your life
[1:03:26] trying to get rid of it don't spend your
[1:03:28] life being bitter about it just say I am
[1:03:31] who I am and I give it to Christ I give
[1:03:35] it all to

[1:09:33] that way I'd have just laps back hey
[1:09:36] there's a lot of people that got the
[1:09:37] same conditions and circumstances you

[1:09:40] have another
[1:09:44] drink just smoke some pot and forget all
[1:09:46] about
[1:09:48] it it doesn't bother them but it bothers

[1:09:54] hallelujah
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:10:01] Hallelujah the Waring of the flesh the
[1:10:04] scripture says for the flesh lusteth or
[1:10:07] desires and Wars against the spirit and
[1:10:11] the spirit against the flesh I thank God
[1:10:13] for that one the flesh is lusting
[1:10:15] against that life it has all kinds of
[1:10:17] other desires but the
[1:10:21] spirit the spirit that came out of
[1:10:24] calvary
[1:10:26] the spirit that came out of Jesus is in
[1:10:30] you and that spirit is
[1:10:34] stronger than the sticky nature it's
[1:10:37] stronger than the
[1:10:39] [Applause]
[1:10:41] flaw your
[1:10:44] past the spirit that came out Satan's
[1:10:49] looking pointing at you pointing at you
[1:10:51] look at your past but the spirit has a
[1:10:54] voice and the spirit is saying you're
[1:10:56] forgiven the spirit is saying it's under
[1:10:59] the blood and I don't know if I can
[1:11:02] speak on behalf of God but I believe God
[1:11:04] saying
[1:11:06] amen amen that's why I was so inspired I
[1:11:10] saw them
[1:11:12] forgiven I saw them as my family I saw
[1:11:16] them as the Blood
[1:11:20] Washed
[1:11:22] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:30] no wonder he was
[1:11:35] inspired so I have this and I want to
[1:11:37] give it to you as a phrase the Waring of
[1:11:40] the flesh against the spirit just makes
[1:11:43] us more
[1:11:46] resolved more determined to sacrifice
[1:11:50] and lay our lives down for the cause of
[1:11:53] Jesus Christ

[1:12:00] become affected and atrophied say well I
[1:12:04] because I'm this or because I'm that or
[1:12:06] because this happened to me because I

[1:12:32] minutes though we walk in the flesh we
[1:12:35] do not war according to or after the
[1:12:38] flesh we do not War as our mind would
[1:12:41] tell us or as a human would be for the
[1:12:43] weapons of our Warfare are not cornal
[1:12:46] but Mighty through God to the pulling

[1:13:15] Calvary who is he that
[1:13:18] condemneth and even

[1:13:22] condemn what God has Justified
[1:13:25] [Applause]
[1:13:28] don't belittle
[1:13:29] Calvary don't give Satan any
[1:13:39] credit who is he that condem it is
[1:13:41] Christ that died ye rather that is risen
[1:13:44] who is even at the right hand of God who
[1:13:47] who also maketh intercession for
[1:13:52] us shall the flaw of tribulation
[1:13:57] distress
[1:13:59] persecution famine nakedness every one
[1:14:02] of those is a service within themselves
[1:14:05] an apostle Paul
[1:14:08] said who shall separate us from the from
[1:14:11] the love of Christ shall tribulation

[1:14:39] have been said and continue to be said
[1:14:41] against
[1:14:42] him and against us who bear the
[1:14:47] message shall

[1:14:52] distress
[1:14:55] or
[1:14:56] persecution or famine or
[1:14:59] nakedness or the flaw of peril or the
[1:15:02] flaw of the
[1:15:04] sword as it is written for thy sake we
[1:15:07] are killed all the day long we are a we
[1:15:11] are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
[1:15:13] nay in all these things we are more than
[1:15:16] conquerors Hallelujah and I want this
[1:15:18] congregation to repeat with Apostle Paul
[1:15:21] we are more than conquerors say it again
[1:15:24] we are more than conquerors through him
[1:15:28] that loved us and he demonstrated that
[1:15:30] love of Calvary when the spirit left him
[1:15:33] to come into
[1:15:36] you
[1:15:44] Hallelujah I'm going to stop
[1:15:48] now I'll just take these few
[1:15:51] minutes I wanted to speak on the
[1:15:53] inspiration of his vision
[1:15:57] maybe I'll take just a few moments to
[1:15:59] highlight
[1:16:01] it for
[1:16:04] we all that are
[1:16:07] here all that are streaming all that
[1:16:09] have been Blood Washed we are his
[1:16:13] workmanship
[1:16:14] amen created in Christ amen unto good
[1:16:21] works which God hath before ordained
[1:16:24] that we shall walk walk in them no
[1:16:25] wonder he got inspired no wonder God got
[1:16:30] inspired it wasn't the Romans or the
[1:16:32] Jews that killed him God became
[1:16:36] inspired God bruised him Hallelujah God
[1:16:41] bruised him to get you
[1:16:43] out to bring you to this time I hope I
[1:16:47] don't sound
[1:16:51] repetitious we his workmanship
[1:16:55] brother brandham says back Yonder and
[1:16:58] sometimes we don't let your mind become
[1:17:02] just uh like I've heard that before keep
[1:17:05] it in perspective with what I'm
[1:17:08] saying before the foundation of the
[1:17:11] world before he took this old
[1:17:14] sun and he moved it around this old star
[1:17:17] this Earth that we're living on now this
[1:17:20] Earth and he molded it over here by the
[1:17:23] Sun and laid it around the Sun and he
[1:17:26] molded it on this side and let her hang
[1:17:29] there for a hundred billion
[1:17:32] years what was he making some
[1:17:35] gases and he moved on around to this
[1:17:38] side and he made something
[1:17:40] else what was he making there some pot
[1:17:43] as and he moved around this way and what
[1:17:46] was he doing he was making some calcium
[1:17:48] what was he doing he was making you and
[1:17:51] me Hallelujah I just want to ask you
[1:17:53] something
[1:17:55] if God spent perhaps a few
[1:17:58] billion
[1:18:00] years to make
[1:18:03] this right here so that we could live
[1:18:07] right for 50 60 70 80 90
[1:18:11] years and he did that for the
[1:18:15] calcium that he put in the earth and the
[1:18:17] petroleum and the pach and so on so we
[1:18:19] could live here and have a little
[1:18:22] expression do you think he weary
[1:18:26] with
[1:18:27] shaping that inside person and he molds
[1:18:31] he knows that flaws there he let you
[1:18:33] even be born with it he let you be born
[1:18:36] in such a kind of family he knew even
[1:18:39] those things that are self-inflicted he
[1:18:41] knew those things that we would do those
[1:18:43] sins or those things we would commit
[1:18:45] those things that we even ask
[1:18:46] forgiveness and Satan doesn't want you
[1:18:48] forget it because that that kind of
[1:18:50] thing is in the blood he doesn't want
[1:18:51] anything comes from the blood he'll be
[1:18:53] sure and resurrect everything keep it
[1:18:55] right fresh in your mind like it
[1:18:56] happened yesterday say I can't even see
[1:18:59] that God can't see it it's in the blood
[1:19:02] it's under the blood it's
[1:19:04] gone amen hallelujah and somebody you
[1:19:08] might say well you know how was it
[1:19:11] confessed or how did you confess it
[1:19:13] that's between you and God that's none
[1:19:15] of my business that's between you and
[1:19:18] God and then you just say with David say
[1:19:20] with David let your sentence come let my
[1:19:23] sentence come from your your presence I
[1:19:26] don't want to hear it from the church I
[1:19:28] don't want to hear it from a preacher I
[1:19:29] don't want to hear it from some good
[1:19:31] people I want my sense to come from
[1:19:35] you and if you if you've done it then
[1:19:38] you can prosper my life you can allow
[1:19:40] the Life of Christ to live in me I only
[1:19:42] desire here's my life Lord and let him
[1:19:45] do the
[1:19:47] rest and it's amazing how he'll start
[1:19:49] confirming
[1:19:52] it amen yes amen
[1:19:57] right forgive
[1:20:09] me a minister said to brother
[1:20:12] brandham in the Masterpiece he said why
[1:20:16] is it that you're always balling the
[1:20:18] people out those people believe you to
[1:20:21] be a servant of God to be gentle and
[1:20:24] sweet to them and everything said every
[1:20:27] time I hear you get up you're balling
[1:20:29] the women out about having short hair or
[1:20:32] about wearing shorts or wearing makeup
[1:20:34] and balling the people out and telling
[1:20:36] them how cool and formal and different
[1:20:38] they are said why do you do that he said
[1:20:42] how can you be he said how can you be a
[1:20:45] loving Son of God and do a thing like
[1:20:48] that and I said
[1:20:50] sir did did you ever read about the
[1:20:55] great composer
[1:20:58] Boven he said he probably tore
[1:21:02] up wasteful
[1:21:04] baskets waste baskets full of scrap
[1:21:08] paper but he gave the world a
[1:21:18] masterpiece you know where we
[1:21:20] are and what you see I've never said
[1:21:23] this before but but it came so powerful
[1:21:27] to my own
[1:21:28] heart we're living in a world this world
[1:21:31] is God's it's a waste
[1:21:34] basket it's full of
[1:21:36] crumpled paper of things that's not the
[1:21:41] plan of God when your flaw or or your
[1:21:45] past or whatever more was done there was
[1:21:47] a time that God crumbled up the paper
[1:21:50] and threw it in a waste
[1:21:52] basketall and he's going to this waist
[1:21:55] basket
[1:21:57] out it's going to be so thorough stay
[1:22:00] with me in my little language now it's
[1:22:02] going to be so thorough and so complete
[1:22:05] that he's even going to send a holy fire
[1:22:07] the prophet said and burn the heavens
[1:22:09] where the demon Spirits have lodged and
[1:22:13] come down to tempt you and to give you a
[1:22:15] a terrible
[1:22:17] life and those hordes of hell that have
[1:22:21] played on your mind I'm not preaching to
[1:22:24] somebody outside of this building I'm
[1:22:25] preaching to you here or you that are in
[1:22:27] the in the streaming congregation the
[1:22:30] hordes of hell that come and don't tell
[1:22:32] me they don't talk to you they talk to
[1:22:34] you like they talk to
[1:22:39] me and we have things that if you could
[1:22:42] do it over you'd go back and do it again
[1:22:44] forget
[1:22:45] it say I acknowledge the flaw I
[1:22:49] acknowledge a sticky nature it isn't
[1:22:51] that I just cave in say well that's the
[1:22:53] way I am I got a temp and I can't do
[1:22:55] anything about it it's not that the
[1:22:57] light that is in you is greater than
[1:22:59] that temper greater than that Temptation
[1:23:02] you don't but you may not ever get rid
[1:23:03] of you will never get rid of the
[1:23:05] Temptation and we got things that you
[1:23:07] know we each one have little
[1:23:12] quirks I guess I'm the only
[1:23:16] one praise the
[1:23:20] Lord not praise the Lord that we all
[1:23:22] have quirks but we do have
[1:23:28] and after speaking he said he probably
[1:23:30] tore up waste baskets full of scrap
[1:23:33] paper and he gave the world a
[1:23:35] masterpiece when he was sitting in his
[1:23:37] study under the inspiration notice under
[1:23:40] the inspiration God was so inspired he
[1:23:43] spoke this is my beloved Son there is
[1:23:46] none other this is my beloved Son in
[1:23:49] whom I'm pleased to dwell this is my
[1:23:51] beloved Son here ye him but on the cross
[1:23:54] when he saw that image that perfect son
[1:23:57] paying the price he struck him and said
[1:24:02] [Music]
[1:24:03] speak and he did
[1:24:06] speak I'm laboring on that he did speak
[1:24:10] and that blood is speaking
[1:24:14] now listen while I come to a
[1:24:18] close and he came he got under under
[1:24:21] inspiration and he writes something down
[1:24:22] and go into a study and pray it wasn't
[1:24:26] right he'd scrap it and throw it in the
[1:24:27] basket waist basket look at the Earth
[1:24:31] was filled with
[1:24:33] violence and men and women they just
[1:24:36] didn't even get married men took
[1:24:38] women and the Earth was filled with
[1:24:41] violence and it was filled with pleasure
[1:24:44] and God the Bible says God repented
[1:24:46] himself they even made the Earth what
[1:24:49] did he do he took it that first creation
[1:24:52] and crumbled it all up and throw this in
[1:24:54] the waste
[1:24:56] basket and all the time down through the
[1:25:00] centuries man even Israel they failed
[1:25:03] went into bondage corrupted themselves
[1:25:06] bowed down to images bowed down to false
[1:25:10] gods offered their children and bured
[1:25:14] them now that's something right true
[1:25:18] I've never been able to understand that
[1:25:20] burnt their own
[1:25:21] children and offered them to some
[1:25:24] false empty
[1:25:27] God I tell you that's
[1:25:30] deception that's deception but even then
[1:25:34] God would not give up on Israel I don't
[1:25:38] care what kind of a flaw you have I
[1:25:40] don't care how much bondage you've gone
[1:25:42] into I don't care what kind of sins
[1:25:44] you've committed you are the people of
[1:25:46] God and you will bring forth a
[1:25:49] [Applause]
[1:25:51] masterpiece do you hear me
[1:25:56] God's not going to give up on you you
[1:25:58] may give up on yourself God will not
[1:26:00] give up on
[1:26:01] you and even if you went and and went
[1:26:04] off by yourself God the holy spirit is
[1:26:07] going to keep he's going to keep
[1:26:08] penetrating your mind and your
[1:26:11] soul and he will bring back to
[1:26:14] remembrance the things that you've
[1:26:19] heard he will not surrender up he will
[1:26:22] not give up on that
[1:26:26] amen he got so
[1:26:29] inspired that finally Apostle Paul
[1:26:33] said thou
[1:26:35] Lord in the beginning you laid the
[1:26:38] foundation of the earth and the heavens
[1:26:41] are the work of thy hands and they Shall
[1:26:45] Perish you'll crumble them up you'll
[1:26:48] throw them in a waste basket Hall but
[1:26:51] Thou remainest You're the same
[1:26:55] and they shall wax old as does a garment
[1:26:58] and as a vesture shalt thou F them up
[1:27:01] and they shall and they shall be changed
[1:27:03] but Thou Art the same and your years
[1:27:05] fail not and no wonder through the
[1:27:08] Apostle John he'll cry out in
[1:27:10] Revelations and he that sat on the
[1:27:13] throne said yes this is the one who shed
[1:27:16] the blood he said
[1:27:18] behold attention people attention Clover
[1:27:22] the Bible Way I make all things
[1:27:27] [Music]
[1:27:30] new you're destined for a new body
[1:27:34] you're destined for a new home you're
[1:27:37] destined for a new
[1:27:42] city
[1:27:44] Hallelujah that's your
[1:27:47] [Applause]
[1:27:51] destination and if you don't have any
[1:27:53] sense of going there you may not rejoice
[1:27:55] over it but I tell you for people that
[1:27:56] have been looking for it and longing for
[1:27:58] it and that's why God says you're my son
[1:28:01] you're my daughter you believe
[1:28:05] [Music]
[1:28:19] meu I've been 10 minutes I will just be
[1:28:23] five
[1:28:24] amen and I'm going to quit wherever even
[1:28:26] I'm in the middle of a word I'm going to
[1:28:33] quit do you know why God got so
[1:28:36] inspired because he saw in that he saw
[1:28:39] in that life that was coming God is his
[1:28:44] knowledge isn't merely immense his
[1:28:46] knowledge is
[1:28:47] infinite he saw the church coming forth
[1:28:51] he saw the martyrs suffering for him he
[1:28:55] saw the Reformation he saw Luther and
[1:28:59] say I cannot Rec right I won't give
[1:29:03] up he saw him standing against that
[1:29:06] great Harlot church and he saw the
[1:29:09] reformers and he saw the messenger Here
[1:29:12] Comes
[1:29:15] one don't get me wrong like
[1:29:20] him this
[1:29:23] vessel he's like Moses yeah has
[1:29:27] slow cumbersome
[1:29:29] speech he can't express
[1:29:35] himself but he believes
[1:29:39] me amen he even write a letter to me and
[1:29:43] nail it on a tree he believes me he
[1:29:45] believes I'm here he believes I'm in the
[1:29:48] woods he believes I'm
[1:29:50] alive he believes I'm resurrected and
[1:29:52] God saw him coming coming out of that
[1:29:55] blood and he was so
[1:29:59] inspired I'll let him fulfill Luke
[1:30:03] 1730 I'll let the very life of my son
[1:30:07] issue out through him and I'll give him
[1:30:10] signs and I'll work wonders to him I'll
[1:30:13] let him tell the people The Secret of
[1:30:15] their heart like my son
[1:30:18] did
[1:30:20] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:30:27] and he needs a
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:31] flaw I'll let his
[1:30:33] parents serve and
[1:30:36] worship the very
[1:30:38] Harlot system that he is so going to
[1:30:42] fight
[1:30:45] against I'll let them be
[1:30:47] overcome by
[1:30:49] alcohol the very demon that will take
[1:30:52] his life
[1:31:05] some completely under the influence in a
[1:31:09] drunken stuper and drive a car and smash
[1:31:13] head on in and let him lose his
[1:31:17] life his lips will be sealed I will
[1:31:20] allow that right right
[1:31:25] but he will
[1:31:26] never ER in his
[1:31:30] vision he will be another one that will
[1:31:33] hold to his vision and I want to say to
[1:31:37] this church I have been looking back not
[1:31:40] over the last year the last two years
[1:31:42] over the last 30 years and and and all
[1:31:44] the things that may happen in your life
[1:31:47] but I look back and I say God what was
[1:31:50] your vision your vision shall be my
[1:31:53] vision what did you intend here why did
[1:31:56] you raise us up to get this message out
[1:31:59] then thus shall it
[1:32:03] be this Congregation of people will hear
[1:32:06] me preach according to the initial
[1:32:09] Vision you've been raised up to be
[1:32:11] Witnesses of this end time
[1:32:13] message God was so inspired at the
[1:32:16] thought that this Vision that this
[1:32:18] vision would be fulfilled that's one of
[1:32:20] the reasons he struck him
[1:32:26] amen I haven't time but I must conclude
[1:32:29] with
[1:32:32] this now Here Comes This
[1:32:35] messenger and he meets seven angels and
[1:32:38] he goes back to
[1:32:41] speak brother Randy and sister Lori and
[1:32:43] you from
[1:32:46] Arizona brother
[1:32:48] West your wife and daughter
[1:32:52] Jessica you from
[1:32:56] Arizona
[1:32:58] others
[1:33:00] perhaps isn't it amazing of all the
[1:33:04] Earth God chose a spot out in that
[1:33:08] desert and he was so
[1:33:10] inspired and there were things that have
[1:33:12] been sealed up since the foundation of
[1:33:15] the world and his son is hanging on the
[1:33:18] cross his son is a beaten mass of
[1:33:20] humanity but he sees that there's going
[1:33:23] to be secret that are going to be made
[1:33:24] known to a people and it must be made
[1:33:27] known this Blood must speak
[1:33:32] speak Hallelujah and after the prophet
[1:33:35] of God had that visitation he came back
[1:33:38] and he said he spoke in the seals the
[1:33:40] opening of the seals he said I was so
[1:33:45] inspired sometimes hardly knowing what
[1:33:47] he's saying but he's so
[1:33:51] inspired because it had to reveal yeah
[1:33:54] Jesus Christ now and had to tell the
[1:33:58] people had to have a vessel so
[1:34:02] inspired I'll show him on the other side
[1:34:05] I'll take him beyond the curtain of
[1:34:07] time so inspired I'll show this
[1:34:10] messenger the bodies these people are
[1:34:13] going to live
[1:34:14] [Music]
[1:34:17] in right that's why he said I saw you
[1:34:20] all there
[1:34:26] amen you tell that devil you tell that
[1:34:30] evil one coming by to whisper in your
[1:34:33] ear I've heard different
[1:34:35] things than what you're telling me I've
[1:34:38] heard Eternal things you cannot you
[1:34:42] cannot impose this on me and you cannot
[1:34:45] impede my walk with
[1:34:49] God I reject
[1:34:51] you and I reject your voice because I've
[1:34:54] heard another
[1:34:56] voice
[1:35:00] hallelujah thank you my amen wonderful
[1:35:05] yes sir he said if there was ever
[1:35:09] anything if I've ever said anything that
[1:35:13] was
[1:35:14] inspired it was in that immediately
[1:35:18] after the angels of the Lord
[1:35:20] appeared and about the Seven Seals
[1:35:23] and I was to return back immediately
[1:35:26] after that he said here to
[1:35:29] Jeffersonville and preach the Seven
[1:35:31] Seals
[1:35:33] and I'm not just closing on a qu quiet
[1:35:36] note if I've ever said
[1:35:42] anything he
[1:35:44] said to thousands of
[1:35:46] people he said to the blind man in
[1:35:51] India he told me about that
[1:35:57] and he
[1:35:58] said there was tens of thousands
[1:36:00] hundreds of thousands of people and I've
[1:36:02] been in that church and stood Behind the
[1:36:05] Chair the chair that or the table rather
[1:36:08] that he stood he told me this man had
[1:36:10] been a sun
[1:36:12] worshipper and his eyes had been burned
[1:36:14] out by worshiping the
[1:36:17] sun you think you have a physical
[1:36:20] problem think of this one
[1:36:23] and his eyes had been burnt
[1:36:26] out and brother Brenham said as he stood
[1:36:30] there he's in Two
[1:36:32] Worlds and he looks and he sees The
[1:36:35] Sideburns are black real
[1:36:40] black but in the vision he sees it that
[1:36:43] there's a little gray hair see how
[1:36:45] accurate it was a little gray hair in it
[1:36:48] so he said I knew he was going to
[1:36:50] receive his
[1:36:51] sight but he says then I needed to
[1:36:54] exercise my my faith that it would
[1:36:57] happen right
[1:37:01] then and call for his
[1:37:05] healing thus sayith the Lord and the
[1:37:08] place went into pandemonium they were
[1:37:10] trying to pull pieces of his suit and
[1:37:13] his pants off so they have a piece of
[1:37:15] cloth they had to have the the ushers
[1:37:19] and the people try to protect him and
[1:37:21] that man went screaming as his eyes
[1:37:24] perfect he said he said he saw that he
[1:37:26] would he saw him and turn his head and
