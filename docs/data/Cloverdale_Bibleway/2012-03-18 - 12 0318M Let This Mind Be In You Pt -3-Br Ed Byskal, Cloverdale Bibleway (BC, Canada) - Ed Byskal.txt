Let's pray. Lord Jesus, Lord, I want to say thank you that it is well with my soul. Lord Jesus, that you came to each one of us one time at the appointed hour, that you revealed yourself to us. You took away the the veil of sin, dear Lord. You opened up our eyes, dear God, to behold your glory, to behold your beauty, Lord, not just to behold it, but to partake of it, Lord Jesus, that we could not only partake of it, Lord, we could live it every day. That we could live with you, Lord Jesus. we could walk in this blessed way that you prepared for us, Lord. Father, before the foundation of the world, you predestinated us, Father, to be members of the bride of Jesus Christ. You predestinated us, Father, to glorify you, to praise you, to fulfill your purpose, your plan for our lives, Lord, in this great plan of redemption, Lord Jesus. And Father, we just labor in it, Lord God. We just fight for that which is ours. Dear God, when the enemy comes in like a flood, you said you'd raise up a standard against it, Lord. And Father, that for our healing, Lord, we remember our sister Barb Drake, Lord. How the devil's battling her, dear God. But you said one would slay a thousand, two, 10,000, dear God. So we bind our hearts this morning Lord Jesus on behalf of birth sister Barb Lord and any others dear God who are not feeling well in her body Lord whether it's here on the phone hookup Lord the streaming father those that are in our hearts Lord God for the blood of Jesus Christ Lord Jesus paid it all Lord by your stripes who were already healed Lord it's the finished work of Calvary Lord I believe it was was Wednesday we heard it all it's finished father everything you've done for us dear God you've already done it Lord It just takes us to appropriate that faith. Lord, just to take a hold of those promises of God. Lord, we just pray that you'll just encourage our sister Barb.

She'll take it by faith, dear God, and walk in it, Lord. She'll put her foot upon the neck of that devil, dear God, that's trying to keep her down, and she'll be walking in victory, Lord. I'm believing even for today, Lord Jesus. And father, we're so thankful for these promises you've given us, Lord. Salvation for our loved ones, Lord.

We may not have a specific need that we can think of, Lord, but there's needs, Lord. As those hands were raised last service, there's needs all around us, Father.

And I believe that's the only thing that we can truly express that God part within us is when we love one another. God bless you this morning. Want to turn the service right to our pastor. Give him as much time as he needs this morning. Want to remember our brother Thomas. He's ministering down in the Steamman church down in Sarasota, Florida this morning. Remember brother Ernie this afternoon as he'll be taking the service down in Seattle. Brother John took the service on Friday evening. He'll be ministering here this evening. I think the Lord has a wonderful day in store for us today. Amen. As our pastor comes, let's sing uh 10:41 if we could on the screen. All I want to see is Jesus living in me. The time is coming near. That's all we really want to have reflected in our lives. Not our own nature, not another nature that we pick up off of somebody else, but we truly want the life of God living within us. Amen. Let's sing this together this morning as we turn the service to brother Ed. Oh, I know the time is near where everything that I hold dear will lay before the holy consuming fire. All my words and all my deeds. And every praise on my knees will lay before the holy suming fire. All I want to see is Jesus. All I want to see is me. All I want to see is Jesus shine through me. hurt and selfinflicted pain and everything that I thought gave were lay before the holy cons of knowledge in his name and healing hands and touches We're late for the holy soothing fire. I want to see Jesus. I want to see. I want to see. All I want to see is Jesus. He sh through here. I want to hear Oh, I faithful. All I want to see is Jesus. All I want to see is All I want to see is Jesus shining through me. I want to hear him say, "Oh, well done. You're my precious, precious. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All we want to see this morning is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to appreciate the atmosphere and we want to be remembering our brother Ivan has uh returned to China for a very quick trip and we'll be gone perhaps a couple of weeks and then you know what is happening the Bible says that there'll be a very short work and he'll cut it short It certainly seems that we're there. There is so so much that is taking place. We have a hard time staying a breast of it and we're happy that very very happy just to be a part of it. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I I delight to see God's work uh wherever it takes place, wherever he chooses it to take place. We're thankful for what he's done here. the testimonies. I've been just turning them over in my mind this last week and seeing what God has done in a supernatural. And we we should fully expect it, should we not? &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that? &gt;&gt; We should fully expect it. &gt;&gt; And uh so I just want you to remember brother Ivan in prayer. I will tell you I I probably wouldn't be able to describe exactly what is taking place, what is happening. There is uh there's something that is taking place and they're working on right now that is uh just so remarkable. You have to you'll have to turn your thoughts loose and one day soon we want to let you know what it is that is actually taking place there. uh the use of the use of technology and the use just the way God has ordained things uh and it's it is so so very remarkable. I will just give you this little clue. The King James version of the Bible as you have it and as prophet of God used it is uh not translated into Chinese. it is uh they have the NIV and uh the that version that they use and it's very very different from the from the scriptures as brother Brandham read them and so uh uh we hope to be able to let the people be able to have the King James version and uh and each time there's a question in their mind about what the scripture in that version means the technology that they have will direct them directly to brother Brandham's message. And I think that is remarkable. &gt;&gt; Absolutely remarkable. So I've just told you that much and and uh we we we're happy to be engaged in this kind of thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give the winds a mighty voice. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We talk about a message, friends, but I'll tell you, it's a remarkable message. It's a glorious message. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're also uh happy to have uh our brother uh brother Caleb, who is brother Dio's younger brother and his brother Oed's uncle. And I wonder, brother Caleb, if you would stand, please. And brother, there's brother Caleb. I'd like you to greet him. God bless you. I have a great admiration for the way certain people approach various things. Our brother Caleb is from Paris and he flew from Paris, France to come here to ask some spiritual questions and to view the school. I tell you that's a long ways to come. Some may not feel uh it essential to go across the street, but here's a a man, whatever God has put in his heart, and he has some children, and he's concerned about those children and flew here to see the school and to ask some spiritual questions. And I say, "Brother Caleb, I was happy to sit down with you and and answer whatever I could." And thank you, brother Oed, for bringing your uncle down. Brother Oed came down from they drove down from Edmonton. And so we say, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, also our brother and sister, uh, Hank Iverson are here. I know that they've been greeted already. Uh, brother Nathaniel Iverson's mother and dad and uh, Sister Iverson's father was brother Vanise who was pastor in Gent, Belgium for over 40 years and we were there at their 40th anniversary meeting. He has gone on to be with the Lord now. So, uh, I don't know just how old he was, but he's about 18 or 20 about now. And, uh, we'll we'll be introduced to him someday soon. &gt;&gt; Uh, amen. Great. Join the great host of witnesses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of course we do. So, we're happy to have our brother and sister Iberson here. And uh uh they took the time to drive my wife and I to the Amsterdam airport when we were just over there recently and had the meetings in Germany, Belgium, and and in Holland. And so, um about a three-hour trip took about five or six hours because of the traffic. And I just want to say, Brother Iverson, we really appreciated it very much. God bless you. Amen. Well, um, would we like to turn to the word? &gt;&gt; I was asked by brother Roy Flor if we had if I was going to take another uh an one more series on uh, let this mind be in you. And he said, "Do you have do you have one more?" And I said about 2 and 3/4. So if you pray and and now you pray and and we'll we'll read the scripture and uh if you'll stand with me. Thank you musicians. God bless you. I want to uh have you turn once again to uh Philippians the 2 chapter. We're we're only going to read verses 5 to8. And then we will read also John out of John 12 uh verses 27 and 28 and John 17 and 1. Before we read, let us pray. Almighty God, we just have such a desire, a hunger in our heart to come into your presence and to have your Holy Spirit speak to us. We are people that have come from uh different paths. Uh we live in different places. We have different backgrounds and different upbringings, but we have been all birthed by the same spirit into the family of God. And we're so thankful for the family of God. So thankful for the teacher, the Holy Spirit that teaches us. So thankful for the message that you sent and a messenger that was uncompromising with the word and you laid it on the line. And oh God, we pray you'll keep us always to be true to your word. And may that hunger never eb or may we never become slack, oh God, in this great great race that we are running now. We pray you'll bless brother Ivan today, oh God. We pray you'll bless those that are with him. Pray father you bless our brother Jean Chimpaka. Oh God and the translator which he has just been in touch with. Lord God how we know that your your word must go to many peoples and you it is you that is seeking out every last one of your own sheep and you will bring them for there will be none lost. Oh God none will escape your hand. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray you'll bless every effort by every member of the bride of Jesus Christ, every minister that ministers to the bride. Inspire them, oh God, and bless them. We lift them up in your name, oh God. And we thank you that we can be members of this great bride body of Jesus Christ. And now anoint us, Lord, for service to speak and also to hear in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll read a few verses out of Philippians the 2 chapter starting with verse 5. Once again, let this mind be in you which also uh which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men. and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. I'm stopping to read there and then we will read from John's gospel, the 12th chapter vers 27 and 28. I had told those on this streaming it would be verse 28, but I'd like to read verse 27 also. And before we read, if you can, uh, I'd like to place the scripture, if your Bible has notes, it will tell you that it is at the supper of Bethany. And that supper was just 6 days prior to the Passover at the time when Jesus would be going to be crucified. And then if you read in the 12th chapter then it will tell you uh that the next day after when you're reading here the supper Bethany was where Jesus was anointed and then the next day he had the triumphal entry into Jerusalem. We know now all events are racing very quickly, rapidly towards his crucifixion and death and resurrection. And so now then 6 days prior to the Passover and then the next day, which would have been 5 days prior, he has the trump triumphal entry. And so all of these things which he's speaking now to his disciples, many of them are only recorded in John's gospel. And of course, John was that eagle spirit. We know in the beginning, he starts in the beginning. He starts different from the other four gospels, the other three gospels. And so now we will go to verse uh 27. Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour, but for this but for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name. And then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it and will glorify it again. in John 17 and 1. This was our Lord Jesus prayer. It's only recorded in John's gospel as well. These words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, "Father, the hour is come. Glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee." &gt;&gt; Amen. And all the glory is to our God. Amen. You may be seated. The cross stands as a monument. All Christianity I I see crosses of every kind. the crosses in front of churches, crosses in our cars, crosses hanging on the necks of all all kinds of people. And I don't know what it means to them, but to the congregation today, the cross stands as an emblem of a defeated enemy. Amen. &gt;&gt; The cross stands as an emblem of a mighty victory, &gt;&gt; a great battle that was won and a mighty victory. The cross stands for that. And God has always had the plan of redemption perceived in his mind. He always had the redemption in his mind. The Bible speaks of the of the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world. So, you know, there is no time as such in eternity. But the lamb of God was slain. God knew there was going to be a fall. God knew he'd have an enemy. God knew because he's omnipresent and he's omnisient. He knows all things. God cannot learn anything. And this is hard for us to grasp. We cannot grasp it. We cannot. All we can do is accept it. God knew this great God, eternal God knew these things were going to happen. And he also knew that he was going to destroy this enemy. And I quite frankly myself just as a personal belief believe that this civilization and the creation of the earth and the creation of mankind all came about for the purpose of destroying his enemy. &gt;&gt; He's going to do away with sin. &gt;&gt; He's going to do away with sin. And I doubt really I doubt very very much that we as humans realize that we were we represent the the highest order of God's creation. &gt;&gt; He created the heavens and they're wonderful and glorious. Created the stars and the galaxies and the universes and whatever more and that's all wonderful. But when God was done and he had a man in his own image, a man in his own image, we have to recognize that that was the there was nothing beyond that. &gt;&gt; There was nothing beyond that. You know, they talk about al evolution, but there was nothing beyond nothing could evolve beyond man. Man was the highest order &gt;&gt; and we are in the image of God. And Satan would like you to believe something less about yourself. &gt;&gt; But whatever we are, we are by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; And uh in the in the message uh that he spoke on Job, he said God always had a plan of redemption. And that's been through blood ever since the very beginning of and dawn of time perceived in the mind of God before the world ever came into existence. Let this mind be in you. God before the dawn of time thought of redemption. &gt;&gt; He's going to redeem not only the creation, he's going to redeem this place. this earth where he uh he ordained it of all the planets. He ordained that he would have this one wi with an abundance of seed of every kind of every type of creatures uh multitudes of them extinct today. But God is going to cleanse it and renovate it and make it a worthy place for himself and his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We believe that. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he had redemption and the prophet said he had redemption in his mind. I'm preaching today because I'm desiring by the Holy Spirit to have that that thought that he had of redemption in your mind. &gt;&gt; Let let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus. Uh that we should be consumed with redemption. And I want to if I by the grace of God just to index that and turn it around for a moment that you will see redemption as having been an incredible battle. &gt;&gt; And an incredible victory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tell you what friends, when we look at the cross, that's where the crossroads of eternity or not eternity but humanity. That's the crossroads of all humanity. And there Jesus said he's coming to that hour and he's saying glorify thyself. I was thinking of uh you know we think of uh glory and the word glory and we have uh there's there's many words that in English does not describe fully what the full extent of the depth of the meaning of the word. not just so much the meaning of the word but other reflections of of the word. For example, when we think of glory and the and the language that it comes from uh and and their songs about it, but usually we think of of of the first uh the first meanings which would be of honor and of praise and of worship uh of splendor and magnificence and preeminence. We think of those things. But it it also goes much further than that. Uh we think of something that is that honor and worship belongs to God and to his kingly majesty and to Jesus Christ. We give him worship in our songs. We freely interchange you know God and we interchange father and we interchange and speak about uh the lord Jesus Christ because they are in in our understanding in the teaching of the scripture they are one and uh but it also comes from another word and this is going to be a surprise to you. We think of I'm speaking about honor now and I'm thinking about glory and glorious it is it comes from a root word to think to suppose to be an of to be of an opinion. I think and I judge things to be such. Now just hold it there. God focused on redemption. That was in his mind. And when Jesus said, "The hour is come," that was the hour God had been thinking about. &gt;&gt; This is the hour I'm going to destroy my enemy. &gt;&gt; This is the hour I'm going to strip him. &gt;&gt; This is the hour I'm going to do away with death. This is the hour I'm going to free my children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I began to think about the great battles. And I looked up some of the great battles. I'm not going to bore you with it, but there's the battle of Trfalgar and the battle of uh in Russia. In fact, as Russia's just been going through celebrations, uh I don't know, they have 15 days of celebrations or something. And uh Mr. Putin has just been up and he spoke of the glorious army and the glorious nation and the glorious Russian people and the glorious this. Why? because they won certain victories in the Second World War when uh Nazi armies came through France and they came, you know, the the arc of triumph or whatever and then they were able to march through there and and people always think of it the glories of the spoil, the glories of the victory, the glories of this army. And yet they're rejoicing over death and destruction and turmoil and broken homes and broken lives and broken bodies and spilled blood on the earth. How can that be glorious? But this is a glorious one. One was going to die. &gt;&gt; One was going to shed his blood. &gt;&gt; And it was going to be the blood of the new creation. And this is where, as I said last week, this new creation, this blood cell, that's where Satan got stopped. And God was going to break that blood cell. Hallelujah. And let the spirit from that one come back into his children again and have sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why it's a glorious a glorious cross, a glorious victory. And that's the focus of eternity. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah to the lamb. Glory to God. Don't you ever be ashamed to give glory to God and the Lord Jesus Christ that paid the price. &gt;&gt; For this hour, for this cause, I came &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Uh, brother Brandham spoke in the Srian church age said when the Holy Ghost came upon Mary, he created within her womb the cell that would multiply and become the body of our Lord Jesus. And he said that cell was created. It was the beginning of the creation of God. Those of you that follow the message, you know that is the statement that was made to the last messenger, the Leodysian church. Thus said the amen and faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. He announced it himself and he only announced it to the seventh church age messenger. He wanted to let him know because that messenger, a prophet messenger had to also be invested with creative power in a third pole ministry. Speak the word &gt;&gt; and so shall it be. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; What a glorious message we have. This isn't mere religion, friends. We're not a We're not a gathering like most gatherings are. We have a different kind of a message. I don't know you a different kind of a a vindication. We have a message that's been proven, &gt;&gt; a proven message &gt;&gt; and you can have confidence in it. &gt;&gt; The cell was created the beginning of the creation of God. That is who Jesus is. And that and that holy one was filled with holy blood. Oh, listen to these words. This is incredible. That holy one was filled with holy blood, even the blood of God. For the scripture says so. That tabernacle came to birth. He said he grew to be a man. He went to Jordan and there the sacrifice was washed of John in the river called Jordan. And when that acceptable sacrifice rose out of the water, God came and dwelt in him, dwelt him, filling him with the spirit without measure. And when he died and shed his blood, that perfect life of God was liberated to come back upon the sinner who would accept that Christ as his savior. &gt;&gt; That's the whole story in one paragraph. &gt;&gt; You talk about a victory. He said, "And when that blood cell and the token when that blood cell was broke, it released God through the sanctifying power that the blood had to come back to the believers." &gt;&gt; That's why in the whole Old Testament, all the blood that was shed, the animal blood, but the there was nothing to no life to come back upon the believer. Now, I take a quick turn. For those of you that know the message and those of you that don't know it that well, you should come to know it. In the messages conferences in Tucson, now in 63, he speaks of the seven seals. And when the lamb came forth to claim his redemption, &gt;&gt; what he'd redeemed, &gt;&gt; time was finished then. And he's in the he's in the work now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's in the work now. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he's in the work now. Aren't you? &gt;&gt; Doing the work of redemption. &gt;&gt; Someday he walks from the sanctuary to take up the book of redemption which was right there in the seals. He comes and takes the book of redemption that he's purchased with his own blood. Now we're talking about Calvary. And then we're talking about him taking the book of redemption. But someday he walks from the sanctuary to take up the book of redemption that he's purchased with his own blood. Then the hour is over. He comes forth then to claim what he has redeemed. So this morning I want to begin by saying the reason why Calvary is such an incredible uh uh uh not merely an experience but an incredible emblem for us is that number one there's two things. Number one, he made the purchase &gt;&gt; and then when he would be revealed again in the end time he makes the claim &gt;&gt; on what he purchased. Number one, when he made the purchase, we're in the devil's pawn shop. &gt;&gt; But when he comes and claims it, we're out of the devil's pawn shop. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so the cross stands for two things, very important things. Number one, God took the devil to task. God broke the powers of the enemy. Hallelujah. And then he comes in the end time to make his final claim. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's made his claim, friends. &gt;&gt; And the dead in Christ shall rise. Those who died in the faith. And I would say we have to be alive and quickened and filled with the Holy Spirit that we might identify. Not all will see those that raised from the dead. Matthew 27 said that many bodies of the saints were seen in Jerusalem. They were seen in Jerusalem. But what it doesn't tell us is who saw them. &gt;&gt; The disciples saw them cuz they wrote about them. &gt;&gt; Herod didn't see them. &gt;&gt; Ananas the high priest didn't see them. Pharisees didn't see them. Scribes didn't see them. Synagogues didn't see them. Rabbis didn't see them. But some believers saw them. &gt;&gt; And if you go to Luke the 24th chapter, you'll find even even believers had trouble. Jesus, the word himself, walking with them in that new body, walking with them. And the prophecy now coming at the end time, one of the last sermons that was preached for you to read, tells us that that is a prophecy. If it's a prophecy, then it must be fulfilled. And if they had trouble back then, there's going to be folks having trouble today. They'll have trouble today. What's happening? The whole thing's falling apart. The message is falling apart. No, it's not falling apart, friends. It's right on time. Hallelujah. It's right on time. It's right on schedule. It's us that get out of time. And I say we need to get in harmony with this word of God. We need to get in harmony with this message. &gt;&gt; We need to give it foremost. &gt;&gt; It needs to become supreme in our minds. Let this mind be in you. This is what God had in his mind. This is what God had in his thoughts. Victory. Victory. Destruction of the enemy. Purchasing my children. Filling them with my spirit. Making them part of the new creation by the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. And claiming them in the end time and taking them home. Glory. &gt;&gt; That's the message. &gt;&gt; That's the message. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I hope you can participate. I'm not just excited as a preacher. I'm excited at the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I can come to this pulpit feeling like a stick of wood. But before I start reading some of the things God's prophet said, it just comes with new life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He &gt;&gt; said when the seven seals were opened &gt;&gt; and thus he reads the scripture also brother Brandham in the seals first in the rising of the sun I'm going to read two or three quotes here &gt;&gt; but I'd like to say so glory to glory is also to have it in your mind and That's what was in God's mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it also is to show or to expose to vision, &gt;&gt; to expose to the eyes and to give evidence and proof. And I tell you what, Calvary in the resurrection was proof of who he was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He didn't just live and claim some things. He proved them. Amen. &gt;&gt; This message didn't come as a new way to believe. This message did not come to establish some more churches &gt;&gt; or just to or or even just to give us some things that were lost down. This message came as proof &gt;&gt; that he was resurrected. And that's why the messenger said all the time in the in the earlier part of his ministry to prove and let God let the God who I've spoken of. If this is the truth, let him come now and prove what I've spoken is the truth. Listen to me, my brother, my sister, and all who are on the internet and all who may be on the telephone hookup. Listen, I have a statement to make. This message has been proven by a supernatural act of almighty God to have been true &gt;&gt; by multitudes of healings and multitudes of the revealing of the secret of the heart. You can hear it if you have time. And the and the fact that seven angels came in a great cloud from the heavens, angels in a split, that was only another one of the proofs. &gt;&gt; Just another one of many. Amen. &gt;&gt; All you folks need to rejoice over that &gt;&gt; to think that that God called you &gt;&gt; and made that known to you. &gt;&gt; And if it's not revealed to you, say, "Oh God, make this real to me before I leave this place. &gt;&gt; Let it be real to me." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was the evidence of the deity &gt;&gt; of God here on earth. &gt;&gt; His resurrection was the evidence of the defeat of Satan. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. Satan is defeated. &gt;&gt; I determined when I was coming to the pulpit today, I'm going to rejoice over his defeat. I'm going to rejoice over his wickedness. &gt;&gt; I'm going to rejoice over the spoils of this victory we have sitting here. Those that have been healed, I rejoice over the spoils of victory. This to me is the glory of God. &gt;&gt; I want to move it away from just singing a song &gt;&gt; and imagining worship. &gt;&gt; I want to bring it to a reality. We have the glory of the spoils of victory over Satan. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we have some who are afflicted and some who are sick and some who are still bound and some who are still blinded. I want to rejoice with you that your eyes can be opened &gt;&gt; and that your life and soul can be loosed &gt;&gt; from the enemy. And some of you who may be calling on God for those that are not here in his presence, we claim them in the name of Jesus Christ. And I have also spoken my own words in prayer. Satan, you have no power. I am gloring in Calvary. I'm gloring in the cross. I'm gloring because you were defeated. And I want to inspire you to believe. &gt;&gt; We have nothing else here. &gt;&gt; What are we going to glory in? &gt;&gt; Some education, some university, some college. What are we going to glory in? Uh some team wins. Our favorite hometown team wins. What are we going to glory in? No, we glory in the cross. &gt;&gt; We glory in the victory of our heavenly father. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why do we say praise the Lord? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're going to freely give him glory. &gt;&gt; The devil has held you long enough. &gt;&gt; The devil has shaded your eyes long enough. &gt;&gt; As a as brother Murphy said on the last meeting, push the button. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Release the bomb. Let the enemy know he's defeated &gt;&gt; and he can't hold you any longer. &gt;&gt; And the ministry of Luke 17:30, the revealing of the son of man in this day is the evidence. &gt;&gt; Don't lose the evidence. &gt;&gt; If you come into a court, you'll need evidence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we have the evidence. that he had returned &gt;&gt; to claim his own. &gt;&gt; We're living in the time of redemption's claims. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; In the rising of the sun, he said that is the identification that we are beneficiaries with him &gt;&gt; in the resurrection. &gt;&gt; He proves what he's talked about. &gt;&gt; That's the evidence we have. He has proved what he talked about. &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus in the messengers ministry, that ministry that called you into this service today, he proved what he was talking about. &gt;&gt; We don't just have some theology. We have a proven message. &gt;&gt; One that never never God never let the words fall to the ground. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. a proven message. &gt;&gt; He said, "What he promised to do in Christ, he proved it &gt;&gt; in the resurrection. What he promised to do in the days of Moses, he proved it. What he promised to do in the days of Enoch, he proved it. &gt;&gt; In the days of the apostles, he proved it." That's wonderful, isn't it? But then he goes on, "And now." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You ought to say it. And now in this day, he proves what he said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's why we have a congregation of people that rejoice. And what we're rejoicing in is a victory at Calvary, the crossroads of humanity. And here we are in the end time rejoicing because he proves his claim. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When he came to the first seal, now we have seven seals. Follow me closely. I've always desired if I could convey to the people the supernatural aspect of this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham when he preaches and you you're hearing words and say, "Well, I heard a tape. I heard a message. I read a message." I must convey to you one line he may be speaking about the congregation or what's right there. One line he might be speaking about somebody who's sick and afflicted, whatever. And the next line he may be completely into the eternities &gt;&gt; and bringing a thought &gt;&gt; from God into your mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you might be inclined to think, well, you know, kind of where what is he saying and where did that come from? That's for you to ponder and to pray and to say, let this mind &gt;&gt; be in me, &gt;&gt; which was also in Christ, and it's in the revealing of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God. And in this day, he proves what he said because they are a part of that seed that was represented &gt;&gt; on the book of life that he came to redeem back to God again. &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, "Oh, what a message." &gt;&gt; He's the preacher, but he said, "Oh, what a message." Because it wasn't his message. &gt;&gt; It's God's message. So we come to the first seal and in the first seal you'll find a long I don't want you to get lost in the technical parts but he about paragraph 145 when you're in your seals book and he says because he's just starting &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; he said well you say well him coming to the end of the road and you got trouble. What does it make you think when some great spiritual thing happens that troubles you? Now, not trying to interpret this for you, but he just was reading the scripture. He was reading the scripture. Now, my soul is troubled. He just read that scripture. And now Jesus is saying, "And now my soul is troubled." Not troubled because he thought he's going to be defeated, but the awful suffering that was coming, the weight of the world. &gt;&gt; Listen folks, sometimes, most times, we can't we can't handle the weight of our own failures. We can't handle the weight of our own past. &gt;&gt; We have trouble with the weight of our own sin. &gt;&gt; Here's one. The beginning of the new creation &gt;&gt; that has the sin of the world upon his shoulders. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You didn't understand that. &gt;&gt; The sin of the world. &gt;&gt; Not your failures only. The sin of the world. &gt;&gt; The sin of every prostitute. the sin of every criminal, the sin of every the sin of the world. This is the one who knows how to do battle with Satan. &gt;&gt; And he came as a result of the word for a virgin shall conceive. And that's how he was born. And the words of God were locked were lodged in the womb of a virgin. And thus came this God man, &gt;&gt; the son of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God was in him &gt;&gt; reconciling the world to himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't comprehend that. And so in saying now, Father, I'm troubled. And now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. For this cause came I into the world. &gt;&gt; But it's a dark hour. It's a hard hour. &gt;&gt; The spirit's going to leave him and he's going to cry out when even his closest disciples like you and I might see ourselves as being faithful disciples. But because of the heaviness of their own heart heart and seeing their master in his heaviness, they fell asleep. in the garden of called Gethsemane. And there he falls on his face and sweat from his face as though it were great drops of blood. And he's crying out, "Father, if it's possible, &gt;&gt; let this cup pass from me, &gt;&gt; but nevertheless, &gt;&gt; not my will, but thine be done." &gt;&gt; What an example. &gt;&gt; What a savior. What a shepherd. What a leader. who for the joy that was set before him &gt;&gt; endured the cross. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Counting the shame as a joy. &gt;&gt; Because he knew who was it? Who was the joy that what what was the joy that was set before him? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My wife, &gt;&gt; my wife, my bride, &gt;&gt; my elect. Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't feel worthy of that. But we must accept that was it &gt;&gt; because he came and called you. He came and he came and found you. &gt;&gt; He came and reached down maybe through gener generations of families and found you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We had some wanderings and some stumblings and look where we came from. Look where you came from. Who for the joy if you could only find yourself in that place today and say he saw me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He saw me. He knew I would be here. &gt;&gt; He knew I'd hear his voice. &gt;&gt; He knew I'd recognize it as a great shepherd. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He knew I'd be moved. He knew I had to give myself and surrender my life &gt;&gt; to him who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross and now my soul and brother Brandham is reading these scriptures. Now listen and please have some discernment have a spiritual mind. Now he's here's seven angels of first in December he's had a serious time and he's had the vision &gt;&gt; of the meeting of the angels of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saying they will come from eternity when he tried to describe it they came out of the eternities in a split. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't have even a moment to think about it. And in the vision, he's in a room and his wife is tapping on the door, it says, "And it seems that my Bible was open." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll let you have an exercise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take your Bibles. Open it to Romans. where you find the ninth chapter. Now he's going to tell the vision. You got it open to Romans nine. Is it open to any special verse? No, it's just open to Romans 9. But if you read in the seals, he'll tell you it was open to Romans the 9th chapter, the 33rd verse. Now, just before you get too caught up in that verse, let me tell you what's happening. Here is this messenger. And Elijah spirit that has come been sent onto the earth. The last messenger to come &gt;&gt; had to be a prophet messenger to tell what has been and what will be. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now he's coming right to the crux &gt;&gt; of his message, the critical. This is the very epic part. &gt;&gt; He's coming right to that one. And so before he even comes, God gives him another vision. He's had thousands of visions &gt;&gt; and has proved them &gt;&gt; over and over &gt;&gt; and made it made it available to you scientific people. You can read it. You can hear it. You can bring it out of space, do whatever you want, but God is going to judge this world because he gave him an opportunity. And they didn't even take the time &gt;&gt; to determine. He says, "Here's my proof. I'm proving it to you. I'm proving it to you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you like something proven? And yet, we open up our ears to every kind of gobblegook and this, that, and the other thing, and no proof to it whatsoever. Just a bunch of fantasy and a bunch of nonsense. Here we have a proven message. &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm going to dig it into the devil good today. &gt;&gt; The devil has nothing like this. &gt;&gt; The church world has nothing like this. &gt;&gt; God has proven this to you. And all of you that are sitting here listening to me, I'm going to dig it in deep. God proved it to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He will be without excuse. &gt;&gt; He's brought the world to a court case. &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet spoke the trial again and again and again. And he was a representative &gt;&gt; for the almighty God &gt;&gt; cuz he could stand and prove &gt;&gt; this God. This pillar of fire who I said is here standing between I and the woman or I and the man standing here at the pulpit not two feet away from me over and over and over again and then proved that he was there &gt;&gt; in the supernatural &gt;&gt; and so now the seals that have been sealed in the back part of God's mind the secrets &gt;&gt; and what does he say in that verse and he tells his messenger. His messenger says, "It seems that my Bible was open to Romans 9:33." 9:33 is an announcement. Behold, &gt;&gt; attentional. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I lay in Zion, &gt;&gt; a stumbling stone. &gt;&gt; Who is it? The revealing of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And the rock of offense. Not a rock of acceptance, but a rock of rejection. The same one that was crucified. Hallelujah. But there the cell was broken. And now he's going to claim what he what he purchased. &gt;&gt; Isn't it worthwhile rejoicing, friends? &gt;&gt; I come to claim you. We talk about this message, but this message is his claim on you. &gt;&gt; He's claimed you &gt;&gt; and that's why it means something to you. &gt;&gt; If you're here this morning, it doesn't mean a thing to you. &gt;&gt; I'd be worried. &gt;&gt; If it doesn't mean a thing to you, you better prepare for the tribulation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not trying to be harsh. I'm just trying to be gentle. &gt;&gt; You need to rejoice &gt;&gt; that he claimed you. for his own. This message is his claim. &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God that brought the message is the same spirit that quickened you to it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so he's in the first seal and he's saying, &gt;&gt; "Father, glorify thy name." &gt;&gt; And there came a voice from heaven saying, &gt;&gt; "Praise God." Amen. &gt;&gt; I have both glorified it &gt;&gt; and will glorify it again. &gt;&gt; It was a glory. It was a glorifying over the defeat of Satan and over the purchase of God's children. But he would glorify again in the end time when the seals are open and the family of God is gathered. &gt;&gt; I want to say to you that God is present on the scene now glorying himself. He's being glorified. that what he purchased back there is being gathered together and he's going to defeat the ultimate death and raise his children out of the grave. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And going to change these bodies. How? I don't know. But there'll be a sweep that'll go over us. &gt;&gt; I assume you'll be taking one step in time and the next step in eternity. Glory to God. Here's our word. We shall not all sleep. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. &gt;&gt; That's his word. And if he proved every other one, he'll prove this one also. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And that's why at the first seal, he must bring this in. &gt;&gt; At the very beginning of the first seal, I have both glorified it &gt;&gt; and will glorify it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "And I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals," &gt;&gt; he said, "what happened." &gt;&gt; And I heard as it was a noise of a thunder. Amen. &gt;&gt; And oh, he said, I'd like to dwell on that just a few minutes. I hope now that all the people that know these things and are waiting for the consolation of the Lord &gt;&gt; and those that are, and I said, I'm speaking to people that are here and waiting for the consolation of the Lord. &gt;&gt; He said, well, now study real close. &gt;&gt; So, you don't only be here waiting for the consolation of the Lord, but study real close. That's why I'm preaching today. I'm preaching this in detail so that you and I together can study real close. &gt;&gt; What it is that this messenger is saying &gt;&gt; study real close and on the tapes also that you think of this. The first thing happened when the lamb broke the first seal &gt;&gt; a thunder roared. &gt;&gt; He said now that's got a significance. It's got a meaning. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's a meaning. Nothing happens without a meaning. &gt;&gt; All right, he said a thunder, a thunder roared. &gt;&gt; Wonder what the thunder was. And he goes back to John's gospel where it says in that verse and and there was a thunder. He said, "Glorify thyself. I have glorified and I will glorify it again." &gt;&gt; And they said, "And a thunder spoke out." &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and Jesus said that was that that that voice came &gt;&gt; not for me but for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Am I going too fast? &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; You're all right. &gt;&gt; All right. And Jesus answering them, saying, "The hour has come &gt;&gt; that the Son of Man should be glorified." &gt;&gt; Glorified. what glorified in victory. &gt;&gt; What was it that had come? Now, if you were wise enough and if God allowed you to know the hour's come, &gt;&gt; amen that I am to depart this world. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be going now in just a few days. I have heard and I know and I met some who God allowed to know that there's a brother, a very humble pastor. I don't think he even had a church, but he was a worker. This brother, he would get on a a train in South Africa. He lived in one of the areas just out of Cape Town and he get on the train in the morning. He didn't care where the train was going. He just would and he would witness and hand out tracks and speak of the message and tell people of the message of the hour and the and what what God has done this time and he'd go for maybe half a day and then he'd just step off that train, get another one is going back and he just preached on the trains all the time one day and he had a prayer he had a a little building at the back of his property. lived real poor and he had a little building at the back of his property where he went and prayed and that was his place. His children had never been in there. The reason I know this so well is because his son who his son wanted me to adopt him and bring him to Canada. So I know these details very very well. And one day he said to his son, he said, "Uh, come with father." So he took his son and they went back to the back of the property and his son had never been in that place and he was he was somewhat spooked. I'd never been where father prays. And he went into place and there was pictures of some of the great ministers on the wall very holy sacred place. And he said now son he said you have become a man and you must be a man now. He said father's leaving. He said but where are you going? No. He said, "Father's going to be leaving you now." And here and he went and he got some things, some papers. He said, "Here's the payments on the car." And there's only one, it was either one or two payments that were left to be paid. And he got a little box and he said, "Here's the extra set of keys for the car. you are a man now and I want you to take good care of mother cuz father is leaving. And it was either the next day or the next day he just laid down and went to be with the Lord. There's no sickness. And that son, he was so moved, so effect, you can well imagine. and he and I communicated and I knew that uh he I could not take him. He was he was very very intently desiring. It wasn't just a passing. He warned me please adopt me so I may be your son. I don't know what became of his life but that was a wonderful brother and I've seen him a number of times. that brother, he was a minister, but he never had a church to my knowledge. Jesus knew he was going and he told his disciples and said, "The son of man must be slain." And the chief priests, he even said, "Who will do it?" The chief priests and the scribes, they will slay the son of man. And I'm leaving. And that's why when you read John's gospel, don't just read it like a book. &gt;&gt; It starts back in about the 13th chap 12th chapter, the supper at Bethany. This is just 6 days before he's going. He's going in a few days. And then he has a triumphal entry and they get a little colt of an ass and he rides into Jerusalem and they're waving palms and hosana and throwing their coats and jackets on the ground. So the so he can come over it and giving him such you'd say that's glory. No, when the cross with the blood, God's blood drenching out of that body &gt;&gt; soaking the earth, that was glory. &gt;&gt; That's where we were born. That's where the price was paid. &gt;&gt; Your healing was paid for in full. Your deliverance was paid for in full. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Healing for every negative thing. &gt;&gt; I said to the brothers, a lot of us came from perhaps difficult backgrounds or whatever. Some perhaps didn't have much of a home. Some of you maybe here didn't have much of a home. Don't let Satan take that and hold it in front of you. say you can't be anything for God because of that. That was paid for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you can take the most difficult thing in your life. You can take the most tumultous background in your life. It can never be an excuse for failing in God's kingdom because God paid for success for you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to put it in the devil's face, friends. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to give personal testimony, but um my life was broke up. My whole home was broke up with mother's departure at 32 years old, gone in the home. And mother and father, stepmother and father were all over in construction camps. And I was boarded out here, there, this farm, that farm, this preacher's house, that place, blind, this blind woman's house, and her husband never had any children. When I got into my late teens, I decided now I can just become bitter about this. &gt;&gt; I haven't had a home. &gt;&gt; I haven't had a proper education. I haven't had the chances these other young people have had. I can become bitter about this or I can just take the things that I really feel &gt;&gt; I missed and I'm going to index it around and let it be a blessing to me. &gt;&gt; I'm going to let it make my heart more tender. &gt;&gt; I didn't have a home. I'll see that my kids have a home if God gives me his children. &gt;&gt; Didn't have that. a lot of things we didn't have and decided that the life that was really worthwhile is to pour all my strength and all my effort. Don't just listen to me now because I'm coming down very very I'm coming to your address. I just decided I'm going to do whatever I can. If the church needs to be swept, I'll sweep the church. If it needs some help building something, I'll build something. I'll be there. I'll work out in the yard. I'll work out on the porch. I'll do whatever. if I can be there and learn to play the guitar. So, I sat up and played the guitar. God bless you musicians. I just did that. Did that. And you just do that. And as God opens the door, I'm there. Whatever I can do, I'll be there. Do you hear me? &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to pick up the mantle. &gt;&gt; Even the prophet of God, he wondered who will carry this message on. We are privileged to carry a proven message on &gt;&gt; and give it voice. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And extend it &gt;&gt; and do whatever we can. What can I do? God will show us. He'll open a door for us. Where you work, where you live, where you shop, whatever it is, you young men and young women, what an opportunity you have. I wish I was your age again. I say, "Oh, with the songwriter, oh, for a thousand tongues, for a thousand lives, every opportunity I would have to live it for Christ." &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, you're up preaching." Don't forget I worked. &gt;&gt; I work for a living. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I want to work and want to present myself as a Christian, &gt;&gt; a real Christian. &gt;&gt; Wherever we are, just be a real Christian. &gt;&gt; Be a real example of this message. Don't be interested in the world, young people. The world has nothing to offer you. Trouble, heartache, death. &gt;&gt; And I'm preaching today about him who was who was defeated at Calvary. &gt;&gt; And has no hold on your life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So brother Brand says, "So now we're at the end of an age." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "You see, you're at the end of an age here. There his ministry is ending." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So was Brother Brener's ministry ending. This was coming to it's another fulfillment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His ministry was ending. So he says, "You're at the end of an age there. His ministry is ending. The hour's come. the son should be glorified. &gt;&gt; He breaks. He asks you this question. What about the hour has come &gt;&gt; when his bride must be taken away? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible? &gt;&gt; Amen. pulling it right out of the scripture &gt;&gt; just when Jesus is saying in John 14 and he's telling them now he he get he moves along further &gt;&gt; John 13 John 14 he says now uh uh I I'm I must leave it I must leave let not your heart be troubled neither let it be uh uh afraid said and I I'm I'm leaving I must I must leave but if I go away I'll come again &gt;&gt; and receive you under myself. There's the same same two things. He was leaving then, but he was going to come again to receive us to himself. &gt;&gt; He wasn't going to come down into Satan's Eden again. He came to Satan's Eden back then. And he gave his life then. This time he's coming in his dimension to take us from this dimension to that dimension. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That where I am He's not here to die and suffer again where I am. He's in that other realm. &gt;&gt; And God sent you and I a messenger that stood here and constantly in that realm and had interchange with that realm, interaction with it to prove to you and I that's where we're going. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What about the hour has come when his bride must be taken away? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What that hour has come that time shall be no more. Not the clocks are going to stop. &gt;&gt; Amen. But they they'll call on God and call on God and not receive the answer that they have anticipated. There's no life coming back to respond to it. The same churches &gt;&gt; that have hard rock bands on the platform and men and women tattooed like devils and they read the same scriptures you read &gt;&gt; and expecting the same Lord Jesus Christ. I'm sorry friends. He's coming for a bride that's got the character of a bride that loves his word. And those that hear this kind of message and say, "I have no part of that." Then they're simply saying, "I have no part of him." &gt;&gt; Is this too hard? &gt;&gt; What about the hours come that time shall be no more? &gt;&gt; Is all the first seal. He's breaking into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Setting the stage for it. The angel is ready to set one foot on the land and the other one on the sea with a rainbow over him with his feet and say, "Time's run out." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And besides that, he raised up his hand and swore that it would be no more. And when that happened, how perfect it is. A sworn affidavit to the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, it's a sworn affidavit. &gt;&gt; Here's what an affidavit is. &gt;&gt; It's a legal document. &gt;&gt; It's an affidavit. &gt;&gt; If you're going to swear something before a court of law, they will ask you to make an affidavit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what an affidavit is. It's a written declaration. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Made on oath. &gt;&gt; You you give an oath. You can say, "Well, you know, my my word is good." Well, fine. That's fine, but let's make it a little stronger. Okay, I'll make you a promise. Okay, that's good, too. I'd like to make that a little stronger. Okay, I I will swear on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, but what are you what are you declaring? I will make an oath. &gt;&gt; I'll swear on an oath. Now you have double compounded it &gt;&gt; and an affidavit is made an oath. An oath before somebody &gt;&gt; authorized to administer oaths usually setting out the statement of a witness for court proceedings. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you friends, this one that's invisible to you and I became visible to this messenger. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and told him, "Go to the people. This is my word and this is my oath &gt;&gt; and I will prove it. &gt;&gt; I will prove it. Though they can't see me, &gt;&gt; I will prove it. And you'll stand between this world and the next one. &gt;&gt; You'll stand between time and eternity." &gt;&gt; And you hear him say, "I'm in two worlds. &gt;&gt; I'm in two worlds." Have you heard him say that? &gt;&gt; That's where he is. between two worlds. I'm standing between two worlds. I'm standing in two worlds. &gt;&gt; Says one time, "These things are all available to you." He's talking to a woman right there in the platform. He said, "That pillar of fire you see a picture of that pillar of fire stands between I and the I and the woman." &gt;&gt; He said, "I am speaking through it." &gt;&gt; You talk about a filter, friends. You talk about a filter. &gt;&gt; Could anything go through the pillar of fire and be untrue on the other side? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Help me out, friends. &gt;&gt; Help me out. I feel beside myself actually. &gt;&gt; Help me out. &gt;&gt; What a filter. &gt;&gt; What a filter. I'm speaking through that pure. See how close it was? &gt;&gt; I sat at a dinner table in brother Southwick's little campground home. We sat there from supper till late in the evening and the daylight still stays up north. You from the Yukon and up north, you know that it's daylight still maybe 10:00, 11:00 at night and further it stays daylight all night. That's in the summer and I'm sitting right beside brother Brandham and he's telling all the various accounts and brother brothers such south are there and their five sons were all there never heard these things in our lives mouths was open just with a baited breath waiting like for the next account of what happened in Finland when the boy was raised from the dead and what happened here? What happened there? And then he just jerked like this and put his finger up, looked at me, and he says, "Brother Eddie," he said, "That pillar of fire isn't 2 feet from any one of us at this moment." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I didn't have to say, "Can you prove that?" &gt;&gt; What an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; What an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Friends, it's as close as you want to believe it. Lo, I am with you always. Always. Hallelujah. Lo, I am with you always. Even to the end of the age. &gt;&gt; We dare to believe it. &gt;&gt; We dare to believe it, do we not? &gt;&gt; Anything can happen in this atmosphere. Anything can happen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The resurrected Christ. &gt;&gt; Would you like to hear him say, "What would you have me to do? &gt;&gt; What would you have me to do for you?" And you'll find in the Bible this same Jesus. Every time he was asked, &gt;&gt; every time he was asked, he he gave it to them. &gt;&gt; Blindness, a leper, whatever it was, they received it. &gt;&gt; Lord, that I might have my sight. &gt;&gt; Oh, Fred, we got to go way beyond church. We got to go way beyond while I'm at church. &gt;&gt; What would you like him to do? &gt;&gt; So, we're right at the beginning and he goes on right after. He said, "The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified. Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth fruit. Father, glorify thy name. And then came a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. And the people said that stood by that heard it, they said it thundered. And when the lamb took the book and broke the first seal, God spoke from his eternal throne to say &gt;&gt; what was what that seal was to be revealed. &gt;&gt; And when it's placed there before John, it was a symbol. When John saw it, it was still a symbol. It was still a mystery. Why? It wasn't even revealed right then. Amen. &gt;&gt; It cannot be revealed until what he said here at the end time. &gt;&gt; He said, "But it came in a symbol." And notice the first seal when it was open in the symbol form back then it thundered. Now, what about when it's opened in the reality form? What was the reality form? Listen to me. The reality form was God's highest form of of of creation. a man with God in him speaking what the seal was and that was the thunder from God. &gt;&gt; Friends, the voice of God has been heard on the earth. &gt;&gt; How can we say that? Because he proved it. He proved it. You don't have to believe it, but he proved it. &gt;&gt; Take any message. Take identification. Take we would see Jesus. Show us the father. Take any message and he'll prove it to you. &gt;&gt; Blessed are you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And notice the first seal when it was opened now in reality form. He said, "The lamb's blood paid the price. &gt;&gt; It thundered when he spoke it out. And when he did, a white horse rider started out and it still was a symbol &gt;&gt; because we didn't know what the white horse rider and I have read theologians said it was the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And the prophet comes who has been proven says it's the devil. &gt;&gt; How can you get further away from the Holy Ghost? Who do you want to hear? The Holy Ghost and no proof or it's the devil and God proves it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now watch." He said, "It would be known in the last day. &gt;&gt; But it comes forth. It comes forth in a church symbol. &gt;&gt; Do you understand it, church? It comes forth in a symbol of a church that they know there is a seal. That's what they know. But just what it is yet, they don't know because it's a white horse rider. &gt;&gt; It's a white horse rider. He's just coming to it. Are you with me, friends? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the beginning of the first seal. And now the seal's going to be broken. &gt;&gt; And we'll know it's not just a symbol. It's not just a white horse rider. It's the devil &gt;&gt; riding in with deception. &gt;&gt; And he rode in with persecution. &gt;&gt; He rode in with blood and suffering. He rode in with famine. &gt;&gt; He rode in with darkness in the dark ages. &gt;&gt; And then end time, he rides in with a a a a kind of a gray horse, pale horse. &gt;&gt; And if you take that word in the Greek, it says it's a it's a blood disease. &gt;&gt; This generation's got a blood disease. &gt;&gt; And it isn't cancer. &gt;&gt; It's that they don't have the blood of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. And you have had a blood transfusion. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For that blood produced this word. &gt;&gt; And you believe this word. You've had a new birth. &gt;&gt; You've had a blood transfusion. &gt;&gt; The cell of God was broken &gt;&gt; to bring forth this word &gt;&gt; at this time. The actual seal is broken. &gt;&gt; Broken to who? Not Christ, but to the church. I hope the church truly understands it. You people, I'm going to call you bride. &gt;&gt; That's now first time. I'm not going to call you church anymore. Isn't it wonderful to have Elijah says, "I'll call you bride." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Revelation 5 and9 says &gt;&gt; the fifth chapter. It's when the lamb took the seals and you can read it when you go home. And they sung a new song. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They've never sung this song before. And they sung a new song. And thou art worthy to take the book. &gt;&gt; What is this? This is a glorious victory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. over the enemy's defeat. This is not the battle of Stalin Grod. This is not the battle of Trfalgar. This is not the second world war. This is not V day when men died. This is the day that one man died. This is the day that man rose from the dead and said to you and to me, "Behold, I live. And because I live, you shall live also. &gt;&gt; And that is why they sung a new song. &gt;&gt; They sung a new song. Thou art worthy. &gt;&gt; You're worthy to take the book &gt;&gt; and to open the seals thereof. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; For thou was slain. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is part of your victory. &gt;&gt; Because you died, you can take the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, folks. &gt;&gt; Your name was in that book. &gt;&gt; You plan to go to heaven. &gt;&gt; Every person plan to go to heaven. You young people plan to go to heaven. If you really believe that, your name had to be in that book. And he had to die to take the book. &gt;&gt; If he didn't die, you could never get there. He died to take the book. You're worthy. Glory. Glory. Glory. Because you were slain. &gt;&gt; Because he died. You talk about a victory march. &gt;&gt; You're a people that can have a victory march. &gt;&gt; Go home and have the victory march. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every promise in that book is mine. He has purchased it. He paid for it. And I will not give the devil any &gt;&gt; glory whatsoever. I'm closing in just a few minutes. &gt;&gt; You know what? One of our big problems is ours. I said because it's mine also. We look at symptoms. &gt;&gt; The world is full of symptoms. &gt;&gt; I see the symptoms of judgment &gt;&gt; everywhere. I see the symptoms of insanity. &gt;&gt; I say it every day. Every day to my wife, the world's crazy. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; They're crazy. &gt;&gt; This world's insane. &gt;&gt; Is that supposed to be music? &gt;&gt; That's insane. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you've done it. I've turned on the radio. I try to hear the news. We never have the radio on our home, but I like to get the news. I like to get the weather once in a while. like to my wife likes the weather and I try to find what the traffic's doing. So, we're a good team. She said, "Don't shut that off. It's just coming to the weather now." Oh, okay. And I tell her, "It's just going to tell us what's happening with the traffic. I want to know what's happening at the border." This was yesterday. So, we make a good team, but I say all the time. Then it comes on and then the background is boom boom boom boom boom boom and I can barely hear the guy's voice. I'm listening with all what did he say? Boom boom boom boom. Why don't they shut that off so I can hear the man's voice and hear what the weather says. And I go into going to eat. Go you go into your favorite restaurant. What you'll hear is kaboom tick kaboom tickity tickity. No music. Just like we we we've got to, you know, eat to the beat or something. It's wild. &gt;&gt; It's insane. &gt;&gt; Symptoms of insanity everywhere. &gt;&gt; You kids, you got it in your school. &gt;&gt; If you're in the wrong school, &gt;&gt; but you've got it there. You've got it on the streets. You've got it everywhere. I walked into a restaurant here some days ago and there was mom and dad and a girl. She was about 12 or 14. Guess what they were doing? Anybody got an idea? &gt;&gt; What were they doing? &gt;&gt; You're scared to say it. They were all busy texting, adjusting the buds, listening. never said one word to each other. &gt;&gt; They might as well gone to three different restaurants. &gt;&gt; I get worried driving down the street like I'm going to hit somebody cuz they they got those things in their ears and they're going to step off the sidewalk &gt;&gt; cuz they got control of the world. &gt;&gt; You know what? Don't forget it. This is Satan's Eden. And Satan, this devil, this devil, he got into God's Eden, crept under the garden walls, and polluted the bride. &gt;&gt; Jesus came down in Satan's Eden and took his bride and made her a virgin. Not a forgiven woman, a virgin woman. and thus sent a messenger that to make a statement that most people have a hard time with, you never did it in the first place. That word turns people back to virginity. That was William Brandon. William Brandon couldn't say that. That had to be God himself. &gt;&gt; You got things in your life you're ashamed of. They're gone. You got things you're sorry about, they're gone. You got mistakes that made, they're gone. I can say that on the authority of this spoken word where the seal has been opened. You've got sins that Satan will stuff down your memory. They're gone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They're gone. &gt;&gt; It's already done. &gt;&gt; It's been spoken. It's already done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I just have to say what he said. Oh, what a message. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a message. &gt;&gt; And it's true, friends. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; I feel like I'd like to sing. Brother Ryan, if you'll come up here and folks get ready. I'd like to sing. Years I spent in vanity and pride, &gt;&gt; caring not my Lord was crucified. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then he came. Aren't you glad? &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful news, friends? &gt;&gt; It's wonderful news. &gt;&gt; It's right at the opening of the seal &gt;&gt; and it thundered. It was a thunder. And what will it be when the bride shall be taken? &gt;&gt; You may be weary of waiting. Don't weary. &gt;&gt; Don't be tired. &gt;&gt; We're living right in that hour. &gt;&gt; If it's today, wonderful. If it's not, we got more opportunity to serve him. &gt;&gt; What a glorious message you have. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, &gt;&gt; is there more of a fourth part? Maybe. &gt;&gt; I got on page three &gt;&gt; and I thought I'm going to be a nice boy today. I'm just going to stand here and be quiet. I'm just going to speak and just, you know, say it so everybody can hear it and understand it. But friends, just forgive me. I I just got to Hallelujah. I wanted so bad. I wanted so much to dig it into the devil. I saw ourselves marching. Hallelujah. Giving him glory over the defeat of our enemy. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Lord bless you in the name of Jesus Christ. Let's stand and sing it together. You don't have to clap even though it is a happy song, but just as you want to rejoice, it's fine. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh my god. Oh, heat, heat. Heat. Heat. Heat up here. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Very long ago here in this city, the city disgraced its name by bunch of hoodlams, tens of thousands of them on the street. Not in a victory march because the Canucks didn't get to win the game. Oh my. Burning up cars, smashing doors, uh smashing windows, all kinds of nonsense. And we got a name around the world as being bad. But there's a name, there's a name of a people, I'll call you bride. &gt;&gt; Elijah said, "I'll call you bride." &gt;&gt; I can see that one beyond the curtain of time saying to him, "Call him bride. &gt;&gt; Don't call him church anymore. Call him bride. They throw their hats in the air and do all kinds of things. You can clap your hands if you want. That might be a tradition. I'm going to wave my handkerchief. Wave your Bible. Do whatever you want to do. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask brother Oed to come up and say a prayer here before we close. But we're going to sing before you pray, brother Oed. Is that all right? Good. We're going to do it anyway. Oh, the mighty golf that God did. That the last verse. The last verse. Oh. Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. There may be somebody here saying, "I wish I could sing it like that. I wish I had freedom. I've been walking the wrong direction. I've been doing the wrong things." You know how long it ch takes to change that? just this minute. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had people right in front of him. This is this message now. And they couldn't pray for them. It couldn't be healing. And he would say to them, "Do you receive the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior?" They he said, "I do. God bless you." And pray for him right then. &gt;&gt; That's how long it takes. &gt;&gt; In a moment, &gt;&gt; don't go out of this place in this moment. &gt;&gt; Say, "God, I receive your word. Mercy there was great mercy there great When the redeemed, I got to sing a verse or two. when the redeemed are gathering in. &gt;&gt; Oh, they tell me, &gt;&gt; "Glory to God." &gt;&gt; I'm not doing this for you folks. I'm doing it for myself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When I get out out of here, I won't have the same kind of opportunity to rejoice. I'm rejoicing together with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I am thinking started off. and thinking of a rap. Yeah. Heat. I'll have you just wait a moment. Remember, he said just like a child, if there's been an affliction, if there's been an affliction, here's a prophet. See it no more. Amen. &gt;&gt; If there's been a disease, &gt;&gt; it's there no more. &gt;&gt; Just ignore any symbols &gt;&gt; or symptoms. &gt;&gt; Anything that's contrary to what's been asked. &gt;&gt; Every child that comes to God's got to be tried. And we're tried to see if we believe it or not. and you'll have wars and troubles, but remember we're on our march. &gt;&gt; He said, "Ignore the symptoms." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They throw their aprons in the air. He say, "Long as you look at the symptoms, you're not going to see nothing else but your symptoms. It depends on what you're looking at." Amen. &gt;&gt; What I'm looking at right now, friends, I said to God all through my studies this last week, I said, "Give me the eyes of faith. &gt;&gt; Father, I want to see what you're looking at. &gt;&gt; I want to see what's in your mind." &gt;&gt; And so, this little tidbit that we have this morning is what is in his mind. &gt;&gt; Then I begin to think of the great the great crisis, the great moment, the great victory. And since then, since I saw the glories of the battle and the glories of the victory that's go out of this place, friends, don't forget it. When you leave this place, say, "I'm rejoicing. &gt;&gt; I'm not at the Ark of Triumph. I'm not at some other place. I'm not at some war victory. I'm not at some game. &gt;&gt; We're in the race of our lives." &gt;&gt; And what we're singing about is going to be exactly that way. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be there. &gt;&gt; I want to be with you folks. &gt;&gt; I want to march in &gt;&gt; when the saints are marching in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There'll be a table spread. You believe it, friends? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you said, "I believe it." &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I take that exactly as a man or the woman standing in front of the messenger. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. possible it is man crying Jesus saying what would you have me do unto you it's not complicated what would you have me do for you that I might receive my sight give it to him &gt;&gt; you know what friends I just I am so gripped to preach faith to you &gt;&gt; until what you're calling for and what you're desiring comes about. &gt;&gt; This word has promised it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Matthew. Sister Geneva, thought of you much. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to realize we're ignoring the symptoms. &gt;&gt; I don't care where the symptoms are. We're ignoring them. It's part of this world, part of this devil's kingdom. And that's why our Christ was on Calvary &gt;&gt; so that I could preach to you this morning and say, "Look to the cross. &gt;&gt; Look to the lamb of God." &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory. Let's sing one more verse and then then the Savior will give orders. He's already given the orders. Then the Savior will give orders. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. down. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Brother John Andy is going to be ministering tonight. I trust that you just got now come in that same atmosphere. Come with the same expectation. Brother Oed, welcome home. &gt;&gt; You agree? &gt;&gt; Welcome home. &gt;&gt; Our lost son has returned. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. God bless you, brother Old. &gt;&gt; Well, I just want to give you greetings from uh our pastor, brother Herold. And uh he sent his greetings to the pastor and brother John. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; It's been a while. We He also called brother John his lost son. So I don't know who's lost where. Right. Let's pray. Our Lord Jesus, what a privilege this morning &gt;&gt; to hear the message of this day, &gt;&gt; Lord God, &gt;&gt; as it just stuck with me as the prophet said, "Oh, what a message." &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we come to you this morning just to thank you, Father, for opening our eyes. As the prophet says, we are living in a time where people are being blinded. But there is a bride of Jesus Christ that has her eyes open to see the mystery being unfolded before us. &gt;&gt; Lord, we are so privileged this morning to hear the word of God himself speaking through the prophet of today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord God, there is no much we can say but just to give you praise, &gt;&gt; to give you honor, to glorify your holy name, glory &gt;&gt; for what you have done for us today to call us the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh God, the prophet says you become him as you receive the message. Oh God, you have given us, we become the grace of God to this generation. We become the mercy seat for this day. &gt;&gt; Lord, we give you praise for what you have done, Father. Oh God, we give you honor and praise. Oh Lord Jesus, we commit our pastor brother Ed before you to this morning. Lord, you have used him mightily. &gt;&gt; Oh God, you have opened his eyes Lord to see the word of this hour. Oh God, even speaking it to us, Father God, we can see the revelation of what he has received from you. &gt;&gt; Lord, may you continue to use him mightily for your glory. That the blood of Jesus Christ will receive the rapturing faith that one of this day we will leave this earth and be with you for eternity. We love you, Lord. We appreciate you tonight this morning. We ask that you go with us as we go home this afternoon. Lord, may we ponder upon these things. May we think about it. May we meditate upon it, Lord. Because as you told uh Joshua, when you do this, you shall have success, Lord. We we need spiritual success in our walk with you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. We commit brother John that will be speaking this evening, bring us back again to this place, prepare to receive something from you. &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord. We give you praise and thanks in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thanks. God bless you. God bless you. We're going to just dismiss you in the name of Jesus Christ. Go in glory and glory. If you feel defeated, just stay here. If you go and go in glory and victory, God bless you. And we'll see you this evening, Lord willing. 5:00. Come a little early. be sitting here before 5 and just reading your Bible and being prayerful. God bless you. You're dismissed. God is Hallelujah. Victory is all God's All right.
