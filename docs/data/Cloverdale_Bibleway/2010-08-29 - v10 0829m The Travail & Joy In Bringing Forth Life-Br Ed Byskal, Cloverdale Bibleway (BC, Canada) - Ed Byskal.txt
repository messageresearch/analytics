I have brother Ernie come and lead the congregation in prayer this morning. We have a couple of uh requests. We have a testimony from brother John Lei. We'd like to praise the Lord for healing me for two serious medical problems. I was taking two blood pressure medications per day and now am taking none. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother John. Amen. God is mindful of every need. &gt;&gt; And he also writes also for the ministering of the word that's bringing the pure word in its due season. Amen. And through the word comes the healing. Amen. Brother Hughes message wants us to pray for Marcia Mosson. She's the wife of a Canadian veteran and she is actually on her way to Sweden for final treatments for cancer asking that the Lord would intervene on her behalf and we've uh many of us have seen a request that's come from Honduras. There's a situation with a little boy there that's been reported to have been kidnapped. He was first believed to be six years old. Now the report is that he's three and a large sum of US money is being requested for his return. But we know a God. Amen. When the prayer of the saints goes up, it doesn't matter if prison bars or what's the circumstance around you. It doesn't matter if it's prisoners that feel like they have a real good reason to keep you. All of a sudden, hearts change, prison walls break down, bars are opened, and the captive &gt;&gt; go free. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ernie, why don't you come and lead us in prayer this morning? If you have a need upon your heart, just desire to worship the Lord this morning, maybe you don't have a need and you just want to worship our God in spirit and in truth, let's take this opportunity. Call upon his name, Brother Ernie. Let's pray. [Music] Father, we come before you today as as children who have been invited to come to the throne room of grace. We come with humility and sincerity, Lord. But you've also said we can come boldly knowing that you are the high priest of our confession, sitting at the right hand of majesty, waiting to make good every one of the redemptive blessings of the resurrection. And Lord, we have heard testimonies today. We're so thankful for what you have done for our brother John Lelay, Lord, delivering him from the medication, Lord, and for these these two serious uh medical issues, Father. We know that you are Jehovah Rafa, you're Jehovah Gya. And Lord, we just thank you, Lord, for for introducing us to this great supernatural civilization, Lord, for for knowing with with a a clarity and and an assurity, Lord, with an absolute that we are children of the most high God, that we were in your mind. We were in your thoughts before the foundation of the world. And you have a plan for us, Lord, all down through eternity. Lord, we pray for us this uh woman Marcia that brother Hugh has brought to the throne of grace, Lord. Lord, even now as she begins her travels, I pray that you would deal with her soul first of all, Father. And then, Lord, we ask that you would move upon the doctors that'll be treating her, Lord. Father, by the time she gets there, Lord, let let her condition be not as serious as as perhaps they thought it was. And guide their guide their treatment, Lord. But Lord, you can take and you can by the time she gets there, you can make her every widow hole, Father. And Lord, we want to come before you, Lord. There has been much communication back and forth. And we know that saints all over the world have taken this little three-year-old boy who's been kidnapped and is being held ransom. He's a son of a of a message pastor. Lord, I can't even imagine what the family is going through. But Lord, I know that they have faith. I know that they believe that you are the God that can move upon these ones who have done this evil deed, Lord. And you can take their hearts, Lord. As dark and as black as their hearts may be, you can take them, Lord, and you can turn them around. You can let them set this child free. It can be a testimony of your power, a testimony of your faithfulness. Father, we believe that it's going to take place. Father, take this little child, Lord. Envelop him, Lord, even where he is right now. Be with the family, Lord. Be with the congregation. Be with the church. And Lord, now as we turn to the word, Father, we're in deep expectation, great anticipation, Lord, of what you're going to speak to us, we pray that you would take our pastor, Lord, who has labored, Lord, and has waited upon you, Lord. I'm I I'm excited about what's going to take place in this building today. I believe that we're going to we're going to have a supernatural experience. I believe that there's going to be a spiritual transaction take place in this building. I believe the word of God is going to come into the hearts of children. And I believe they're going to be changed. They're going to be transformed. They're going to be renewed and re renovated, Lord, and transformed. Father, Lord, I pray that you would take Brother Ed, lift him up into those realms of glory, oh God. Let him speak what you have had upon his heart. Give him a freedom and a liberty to enter right into that supernatural channel. We ask. And Lord, let us pull upon the word. And we ask all these blessings, Father, knowing that you have heard them, knowing that you answer every prayer. We ask it all in your precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you each and everyone this morning. You may have your seats. Amen. Thank you for praying. Brother Ernie, the Lord Jesus was touched by the feeling of our infirmities. I maybe hadn't been quite touched the way I did just now when brother Ernie was praying. I have a three-year-old son. And I can't imagine on God's earth what I would do other than just throw up my hands before merciful God &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, bring back my son." &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Diversson and Brother Nathan have a special this morning. Maybe they can come and get ready. And brother Diversson's going to be leaving for London, Ontario next Tuesday for school. And he's just wrote in a announcement that he is leaving. He'd like to thank our Lord Jesus Christ for the love and the fellowship that I have experienced while I have been here among you at Cloverdale Bible Way. God be with you. Till we meet again. God bless you. Where's our brother Philip Gersonson and Katie Miller? Sister Katie, God bless you, brother Phillip. There you are. We'd like to thank the Lord for his love and guidance and we are extremely to hap to announce the happy engagement of these two, Philillip and Katie Miller. God bless you. Praise the Lord. And there's a picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. [Music] There's no treasure on earth that can move heaven's heart to purchase my pardon for me. No jewels or gems that I bring could start to pay my penalty. Even silver or gold are offerings to poor to take away guilt. But the truth is, my Lord, that it's only by the blood you poured out for me. It's only by the blood I can stand redeem. All the riches of this world could never be enough to take away one sin. So only by the blood. To the temple they came and the orders run year after year after year. Yet for all of their loss and all I've shared still long true was need to hear you came to us. So one perfect lamb with those on your head, nails in your heart. I listen by the blood. You p up for me. It's only by your blood I can stand redeemed. All the riches of this world could never be enough to take away one sin. It's only by the blood. You've done what nothing an could do. And the song of my soul is Lord, worthy are you. Cuz it's only by the blood. You poured me by the blood. I can stand redeem. All the riches of this world could never be enough to take away sin. Son by the blood. Son by the blood. It's only by the blood. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for that song this morning. Maybe we can just sing the little chorus. I claim the blood Jesus shed on Calvary as we get ready to change the order of the service. [Music] I claim the blood [Music] Jesus shed on Calary. Most precious blood stain were made there just for me [Music] for all my sins. My sickness and my pain. When I need I claim those precious blessings I cla [Music] through that blood [Music] preious blood were made there does for me for all my sin, my sickness, and my pain. When I need healing, I pray those precious blessings. Just as our pastor comes, Lord, I lift your name. We invite brother Ed to come to the pulpit this morning. Deliver the word that the world may the word may heal the people. Friends, we may not need a healing in our body today, but we need a resurrection. &gt;&gt; And that quickening power needs to lie within you &gt;&gt; because if you don't make it to the rapture and you get buried in the ground, there has to be something. There has to be a life in you that quickens what's lying in the ground. We need to make our deposit today. &gt;&gt; Lord, prepare me for the rapture if I'm going to be here for the rapture. But if I'm not going to be Lord, I want to rise &gt;&gt; that morning when the trump of the Lord shall sound. Let's sing this together maybe as we stand on our feet. Welcome the word to come and minister to us this morning. Lord, I lift your name. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] I am the reason I [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] Yeah. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] There are [Applause] the I am the rich [Music] and [Music] aren't those lovely words. &gt;&gt; Amen. I like every phrase. What an opportunity we have this morning. I lift your name. your holy name, &gt;&gt; my comforter, &gt;&gt; and my king. Can you &gt;&gt; agree with all of those words? Amen. Let's just sing it once more. Lord, I lift your name, your holy name. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] I am my God and if he's not our king, who is our king? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't want a king of this earth. We want the eternal one. Amen. Well, uh I'm going to ask for your undivided attention this morning. And all you young people that have uh hopefully life still ahead of you some years, I want you to especially participate in the service. Listen very very close. And uh I it's going to take perhaps a wee bit a different order this morning, but uh we're going to get to it right away. I just wanted to make mention about the uh young person, a child that's been uh kidnapped and uh there's been considerable communication that has gone around. There's one thing that I would like to urge the uh those that are here. When you're transmitting information back and forth, I would really play down the ransom bit. Don't say much on ransom. That's exactly what the kidnappers want. They want us to be consumed with the ransom part because they they know that the person uh the parents of the child they don't have any money. So they just want to use that as a channel to get through. I've been engaged in it before so I know what I'm talking about. and they just know well they got friends or they got church or they got all bunch of churches in America and they're going to loosen up and take up offerings and give and that only spawns another one. &gt;&gt; And that is why you have nations when there has been kidnappings the nations just declare we're not giving any ransom whatsoever. They say we're going to kill the people. Well, it doesn't matter. we're not giving any ransom because what do they get if they do injury to a child or kill a child or whatever more and they really just call their hand is what they do and we have the case with brother uh because of a printing work in India and they took and hauled up brother Daniel Evans into a tribunal court and sentenced him to three three and a half years of hard labor, excuse me, or $30,000 fine. But they said, "We won't take your passport away." Well, you can't be any more blatant than that. They left him with his passport so he could travel to over here and and we did assist him. We assisted him with $17,000 to negotiate. But he even went to Delhi and was right before the prime minister of India and they appealed he appealed to them and they said well if we'd have seen it sooner but this was a a a tribunal of three judges and they'd stamped it that it was nonappealable and we did what we could but then we left it. We couldn't do anymore and they resolved it. He didn't go to prison. He didn't spend three and a half years in hard sometime you have to call their hand &gt;&gt; say look at this is what we can do in that case we came forward because we were largely responsible we had we had the printing operation that he was caring for that he was uh uh penalized over because they had passed some laws that a person could not receive funds from uh outside of India that were that were uh from foreign countries or foreign organizations uh unless they had a a certain status within India, they had just passed this law and he didn't know anything about it. And so he that's how that all happened. But uh and so it wasn't a kidnapping as such, but he was essentially put under sentence by the federal government of India and and God intervened. And so I would say on behalf what we should do is major and brother Ernie you seem to be kind of a a central point where a lot of this communication is passing. I would say that if we transmit them we should say that we are we have committed him into the hands and he is under the eyes of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I would bring those men because I can guarantee they're reading what's going on. And I'd put those men under the sentence of Almighty God that God is watching over this child and though those who have him should be very very cautious that they treat him well because Almighty God who we serve has got control of this situation. Amen. And I would bear that out rather than the uh ransom part. And and others of course are we don't have any control of what others do. Brother Thomas back from Serbia. &gt;&gt; Uh he's wilted a wee bit, but after you have you're in 10 meetings and preach five and a half of them. How do you preach five and a half services? He told me I took five and a half services. Anyhow, and brother Milo went on from Serbia and he's in Israel right now with the saints in Israel. Isn't that wonderful? And I'm so glad we got a printing a printing station there and they're receiving messages printing all the messages for themselves in Israel. Praise the Lord. When has that happened before? Is it nice to be ahead of the devil? Hallelujah. So we want to pray for him and re remember the believers there. Brother Murphy is leaving a week tomorrow for China. an extended time in China probably I don't know how long. So I I just said don't get handcuffed like the last time. So we're praying Sister Tracy and uh praying for Murphy. He will be speaking this coming Wednesday and you won't want to miss it. I can tell you I've been very very greatly blessed by uh brother Murphy's ministry and several have talked to me in just the last few weeks about his ministry and uh uh uh fact is a brother talked to me yesterday about about brother Murphy coming to Ohio wanting to have him come there. So uh we want to be uh uh remembering that service also. Uh, amen. I can have you turn in your Bibles if you would. Brother Tom, you should just give a greeting, I think, from the people in Serbia. I know that they sent greetings with you before we read the scripture. Greetings from Serbia. I'm sure there'll be streaming this morning. They they said, "Brother Tom, are you going to give a report in Serbia on Sunday morning?" I said, "Well, Brother Biscll serve as a very kind man, and I'm anticipating Brother Biscll taking the Sunday morning service." So, they did. Uh, Brother Yonko Thomas and his wife Anna have sent their love and greetings. Brother Dragonir, Brother Elodan that was here last summer. They've brought their they asked me to convey their love and greetings. And of course, I guess you've heard maybe some of you through the grapevine. I was over there to meet brother Miracle's son. And at the end of the meetings, brother um Daniel was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and his wife also. So we had a wonderful time. We had s six baptisms and God moved in a special way. God bless you. We'll give it probably a further report next weekend. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless a preacher that can be short- winded. I'm going to have you turn to John the 16th chapter and we'll read from the uh 16th verse down to the 23rd verse. Thank you for your prayers. Uh, I just seem to rely more upon them all the time. Verse 16, a little while and you shall not see me, and again a little while and you shall see me because I go to the Father. Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while and you shall not see me? and again a little while and you shall see me uh and because I go to the father. They said therefore, what is this that he sth a little while? We cannot tell what he said. Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them, do you inquire among yourselves of that I said a little while and you shall not see me and again a little while and you shall see me. Verily, verily, I say unto you, that you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice, and you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. A woman, when she is in travail, hath sorrow, because her hour is come, but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she rememberth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world. And you now therefore have sorrow. See, they didn't understand why they were having sorrow. But now you have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. And in that day you shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. &gt;&gt; Let's ask the Lord's blessing. Heavenly Father, we have been pondering. We have been looking to you. We have been in prayer. We have been in study. The people have been hearing the words of your messenger. Uh they have been becoming attuned and in expectation. It's wonderful to look down into their faces and see the peace and the joy of the Holy Spirit. And now, Holy Ghost, we say, take control of every mind and bring it into subjection to the will of Almighty God. And may the words that are to be uttered now, Father, be words that are anointed by the Holy Spirit. And may they come to hearts that are anointed of the Holy Spirit. We commit this service and this day to you that the name of Jesus Christ might be glorified. Amen. And the people said, "Amen." Hallelujah. God bless you. You may be seated. Do you want a little insight just into how sometimes God deals with a a a minister? All right. I will read for you some of my scribblings. This message is called scribblings. No, in a few moments I will get to it. But the essence and the substance of these notes are you'll find in the in the message as we move through it. Eve brought forth two seeds. Cain then Abel. Because of Eden, there was Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael, like Cain, came first, then Isaac. Egypt came first, then Israel came next. Israel, however, brought forth a son. the travail of Israel, the travail in Egypt, the travail in the wilderness, the travail under Saul, King Saul, the travail under a divided Israel, the travail in Babylon, and the travail under Rome. But Israel brought forth a son. We don't ask for pains of travail. They just come. Satan sweeps in, but God brings on another birth pain. Satan swing swings in, sweeps in and brings a travail upon the people. But it's God that is bringing on the birth pain. We did not ask for war. We did not ask for a first world war. We did not ask for a second world war. We didn't even know what it was at the time except in a an incredible cost of human life until a prophet comes and says that was a birth pain. &gt;&gt; And the second one was a harder birth pain. And the third one, he said, "We can't stand a third one. It'll birth us into a new world." &gt;&gt; Today prevail. And I speak of the word when the sun is developing, it arrives to its fullness in a certain season. You women that have born children. When a child comes to birth, you can't stop it. It has to happen. And collectively and through time, God has allowed the son of God to move from one office, one position to another to another, but it's moved through the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Collectively, and yet individually, we all participate. Yes. &gt;&gt; So as the son is delivered of the church, she's in travail. &gt;&gt; The pressures of the world. The question is what is causing the travail in sorrow. Thou shalt bring forth thy children. That is individually. The fulfillment and full development of the son the word within the people. the sun must come forth. Nothing can actually with withstand that. And so the intensity of desire within the believer to bring him forth to a place of greater glory. &gt;&gt; And what do we do with such an invitation that we've been given at this time? &gt;&gt; That's the message according to Scribble. She rememberth the scripture says when she is in travail she hath sorrow. Now I've just have three slides only so you can follow me with this. A woman a woman. The church is a woman. &gt;&gt; A nation is a woman. that's never in a male gender, a woman. And Jesus is saying these words because he is at the very point of departing from the apostle, from the disciples, and they're filled with sorrow. And he says, "You have sorrow &gt;&gt; because I've said a little while you won't see me anymore, and then a little while you will see me." And they were they were what's he saying? What does he mean? What does this mean? A little while and you won't see me in a little while. We will because they could sense the atmosphere was that he was departing and the atmosphere was I'm going to be under uh judgment. I'm going to be suffering. And they were under the travail and and Rome and uh the iron fist of Rome. And they were looking to him. He's going to free us from this. But it wasn't happening. And so Jesus is telling them now. He's explaining what's happening. When she is in a travail, has sorrow. Why? Because her hour is come. The time has come. The child has to be birthed. Something else has to happen. And it can't it can't uh you you can't do anything about it. You can't withstand it. And so her hour is come. The child is formed. In other words, but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more her anguish for the joy of a man is born into the world. When she is in travail, hath sorrow, &gt;&gt; because her hour is come. But as soon as she is delivered of the child, she rememberth no more of the anguish. Amen. of all the children that have been born of you that are mothers. I guarantee you after the child is born and you are embracing that newborn child, you are not looking down and saying, "Oh, the travail you caused, all the pain you caused, all the uh time I was sick, Sister Shelly, we prayed for Sister Shelly, and all this, you know, the morning sickness disappears and all of the stuff." Yeah, you remembered, but it's way back there someplace. You've got the child, you're embracing the child, you're taken up with it. But when the problem was because this is a spiritual thing, they couldn't recognize Christ. &gt;&gt; Couldn't recognize the child that something had actually taken place. Now, for a joy that a man is born into the world, Brother Brandham says, and this is where you're going to really need your focus. Have you ever read in the message and you've seen where brother Brandham has kind of stumbled over words and says flusterations and he invents his own words, but you know, it's amazing. We know what he sang and And sometimes you'll get, you know, uh he'll say one thing and mean another and then he'll correct himself and so on. We we've all encountered that. Well, uh this is one quote where I thought that that's what was happening. But it's amazing. He actually was in the very root word. He was in historical uh forming of this word. The Bible said that the effectual fervent that's desperation notice he's desperation effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. When a righteous man, a good man gets in travail or soul travel or travail, either one. I think travel is a better word. When I read that, I thought I can't connect that. What's he meaning? Travel is a better word for travail. Anyway, that's what he said. And travail or travel, either one, which one you want to call it. Either which one you want to call it. But when a soul gets in desperation, in travailing an effectual fervent prayer of a man uh that can show the token, it does something. So I thought I really because I want to speak so much on travail, I want to really uh determine uh as much of the depth of it as I can for uh our benefit. And uh the travail travail simply is in our understanding painfully difficult. It's agony, anguish or the pain of childbirth. But the travail, believe it or not, comes from travel from an old French traveler to the reference of the hardships of journey. And that was key with me because I'm going to be dwelling on that as well. And that came from the old Latin triple air, an instrument of torture. It was actually a threepronged stick uh that uh that was used in in ancient times and and it had the name. So the French have picked it up from the Latin, an instrument of torture to describe the journeys and the travel and and you have to remember that travel back in these times there wasn't Motel 8s along the way or holiday ends or whatever more brother Frank you couldn't just pull in and you know and and go to the Hampton in and come down and have breakfast you know this is Le Oysia &gt;&gt; back then I mean you were grinding it out. There wasn't maybe even water in a lot of places. And let's let's not even try to describe it any further. But that's the way it is. And this is the this is the etmology which is the origin of a word or the part of a word and how it has arrived at its current form and the and meaning. uh an etmology often shows the different forms the word has taken in passing from one language to another and so that is how and now we have a prophet and he says well tra pre travail or travel whichever one I think tra is a better word well it's it's it's the journey and uh that's what I want to dwell on some in in the in the service this morning Now you just hold your time. I'm holding back because I plan to preach in a few minutes. Everyone everyone's life journey is filled with hardships &gt;&gt; along the way. The journey of Jesus Christ throughout the ages has always been associated with travail and hardship. whether it's collectively or individually. And that's why brother Brandon would sing and and sweep into uh uh you know, he was very poetic, but he would he would start with a it's dripping with blood. &gt;&gt; Yes, it's dripping with blood. &gt;&gt; This Holy Ghost gospel, it's dripping with blood. &gt;&gt; The blood of disciples who died for the truth. This Holy Ghost gospel is dripping with blood. In other words, that is a that's a key part of the gospel. It has come at great cost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And this is a problem with me because we have things nice. &gt;&gt; Uh we have automobiles outside. We're sitting in comfort. the air conditioning is doing its part and whoever cares for it and brother Joe Walner and we have everybody in their place and hopefully and we come in here and we're we're comfortable and we we're not accustomed to too much suffering and uh the ads and the newspapers and whatever more is is is filled with and uh the the whole uh medical field is is out there to make sure you don't suffer too much or we lessen the pain as much as possible. And so we're not accustomed. So I've felt you know uh where are we in this whole scene and of course in the coming forth of the gospel there were times and the Bible speaks of it. The Bible speaks of it. They said they said of Jesus also and he's the same yesterday, today and forever. They said he's a good man. And probably your friends many of them say these are good people. These are nice people. These are honest people. They're good neighbors. And so there's that part. But also they also had that idea of Jesus. He's a he's a good person. In fact is there's a scripture which I will give you in a little bit that that's a scripture that really fits brother Brandham to the to a right to the tea. And the Bible says there was great uh there was a great murmuring and dissension amongst the people because some said he's a good man and others said he's deceiving the people. And I can tell you that fits the message perfectly &gt;&gt; because amongst them they'll say you're good people but you're deceiving the people. And Jesus said, "Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes, and some of them you shall kill, not all, but some of them you shall kill and crucify, and some of them you shall scourge in your synagogues or your churches, and persecute them from city to city. Wherever they go, they'll be under persecution. Be why? Not because they didn't like the way the person looked. Because that's the way uh of of what they were representing. Paul said in Colossians, to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. That was the problem. Brother Brandham said, "It's not me they hate. It's the message. The message was the problem. &gt;&gt; When when Samuel was being rejected and he mourned over it and God spoke to him, he said, "It's not you, it's me they've rejected." Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul said in Philippians, "That I might know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death, being made conformable unto his death." &gt;&gt; Peter said, "For even here unto where you called," I like the attention of everybody because I'm saying it to you. I'm echoing Peter's words. for here unto where you called. You're here in the service this morning. You're here in this church. But I want to say to you, you're only here because God has called you. And this is why you're called. Because Christ also suffered. He suffered for us. &gt;&gt; Leaving an example that you should follow in his steps. &gt;&gt; Now, you can't go out here and say, "Persecute me." &gt;&gt; No. But there is a pressure. There is travail &gt;&gt; that comes upon you in perhaps a different a more subtle way. &gt;&gt; And I want you to know that travail is coming upon you. Excuse me for pointing my finger, but that travail is coming upon you because of what you have believed and because God Almighty by the Holy Ghost is guiding the life of his son through the church and through the bride to bring him to another glorious uh uh place or dispensation or era. &gt;&gt; Amen. looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye also be wearied and faint in your minds." But he said, Apostle Paul speaking to the Hebrews, you have not resisted unto blood, striving against sin. And that's probably where we all are. &gt;&gt; We've had hardships and we've had difficulties and we have felt resistance and we have felt cast off and we've perhaps have felt uh uh unwelcome amongst uh maybe unbelieving people, but we've not resisted unto blood &gt;&gt; as yet. And so we can identify but Paul was also speaking to believers who were and had accepted uh the gospel at that time and we've accepted the gospel in this hour. So I would like to say both believers and unbelievers are exposed or subjected to travail of life's journey. It doesn't just happen in a day or an hour or a week, but it happens in life's journey. And listen now, you that are uh Americans or Canadians or what other nationality you may have, you are identified according to the prophet, you're identified with your nation. You're identified with their glory. You're identified with their shame. You're identified with their victories. You're identified with their struggles. You may not have gone to war, but you're identified with the war. You're identified with the sufferings. And so, collectively uh collectively we are what our nation is collectively. And you contribute something to that nation. even though it is might be a minute infotitional part but they might say well uh uh as the American people are known I've traveled much of the world the American people are identified by generosity they're identified by the friendly south are identified by certain things Canadians are identified as being cold or withdrawn on or formal, but we are what we are. I I'm not a Canadian. I'm a Ukrainian. I'm a Canadian. &gt;&gt; So, we are what we are and we are what we are what our nation is. &gt;&gt; And we're identified whether we like it or not. We're identified with it. Now, although believer and unbeliever both, are you listening? &gt;&gt; They're subjected to or exposed to the travail of life's journey. And I'm going to get into this very deep. So, please just really stay alert if you would don't don't let your mind wander. But the result of the believer, the result, the end result for a believer or an unbeliever is completely in two different worlds. &gt;&gt; Totally two different worlds. The wisest man in his time at least, Solomon, he said, "There is a way that seemth right unto a man, but the end thereof is the ways of death." And I can tell you that that man's ways is not easy either. There's a way it seems right to a man. And he goes along. He has his struggles in life, in his journey. He has his struggles, but the end of it is death. Peter said, "Be sober. Be vigilant." Because your adversary, not his adversary, your adversary, the devil, as a roaring line. He's a roaring line this morning while you're sitting here in church. He's a roaring line. Listen to me, friends. He's scheming &gt;&gt; how he can make your life more miserable. &gt;&gt; How he can bring affliction your direction. &gt;&gt; How he can cause sickness to come to you and disease and he's he can be patient. He can cause you he he's got his civilization going and he puts people in coal mines and they breathe in the dust so they end up with cancer and tumors and all kinds of things. He he's developed asbestous and all of those things, man. to take it out of the mountains and and now and then the years later they find out this is a this is a death trap people breathing this stuff in and then we get to you know thank Mr. Ford and all the other people for all the automobiles and then we find out we're we're breathing in all of these gases and we're making ourselves sick and and then we got all this food and it's beautifully packaged and refined and further refined until we eat ourselves to death. But they, you know, they just we we all just gobble it up. &gt;&gt; And it's part of Satan's kingdom. And he's patient. &gt;&gt; But his intent, he's a roaring line. &gt;&gt; He's out there to make your life miserable, he's out there, if you're going to, if you're going to win the crown, he's going to try to make you pay. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's going as a roaring lion. uh walketh about seeking whom he he may devour. Let you go home today and when you walk in the door, I want you to know that this scriptur is intact. He's walking around your house. &gt;&gt; He's trying to see what he can do to make it more difficult to bring travail upon you. But what he doesn't know is God has placed a seed &gt;&gt; into the elected body of Jesus Christ. and and that elected one is bringing forth a life &gt;&gt; and nothing can restrain that life. It's going to come forth &gt;&gt; in its season &gt;&gt; and it'll be to the glory of God. But Satan will try to make it as he did at Calvary. &gt;&gt; He said, and he tells us what to do. Resist him. &gt;&gt; Resist him. Young men, young ladies, resist him. Parents, resist him. All who hear my voice, resist him &gt;&gt; and steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. &gt;&gt; So, some are in the world, some are believers, some are unbelievers, but they all have the same travail, but the travail for the unbeliever is meaningless. It doesn't do anything for him. But the travail, and here's my key point that I you must get. The travail of the world, the travail of events, the travail of all the circumstances, whether it's economic, whether it's physical, whether it's mental or whatever kind of travail, the travail for the believer, only presses a person, the believer, more until it turns you Godward. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Difficulties turn you Godward. You begin to search into the word and you begin to go into the depths of the message and you find your mind on God and you find your want to pray and you find you want to surrender yourself. Isn't it wonderful? The travail of the world pushes us God. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; You that are sitting and everything's just nice and easy. Just wait till your time comes. &gt;&gt; And it will come. &gt;&gt; And you'll remember brother Ed's words. &gt;&gt; And you won't be like the unbeliever says, "Well, I think I'll just go and get me a bottle of booze. &gt;&gt; I think I'll just go to a bar." Cuz there's nothing in there that desires that. As soon as that pressure comes, you want to draw closer to God. You want to get nearer and you look heavenward. Say, "Oh God, I know you brought me here, and I know this is for a purpose. Work out this purpose in my life, and it's the sun that's being formed, &gt;&gt; bringing you to the desired place and moment and time. Satan is in opposition to all that you stand for as a believer." Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, Apostle Paul said to the Thessalonians, and he says to us, "Who opposeth and exaltth himself above all that is called God." This the old serpent, the devil, he's filled with pride. He wanted to exalt himself. He wanted to exalt himself above the stars of God. He wants to and will achieve being worshiped by all whose names are not in the Lamb's book of life. And he says, and that this is the one that we're resisting. He said that he exaltth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he is that he as God siteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. &gt;&gt; I don't care what country we're from or what our background is. This is what's happening in the world. &gt;&gt; This is what's taking place. This is his this is his ultimate ambition that he'll be recognized as God, re worshiped as God, sit in the temple as God and have the people deceived that he is God. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the eyes of the word. Thank God for the revelation. Thank God for his prophet in this generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Now, I want to turn to bringing forth. We're bringing forth. Everybody's bringing forth something. You are bringing forth something. I don't care who you are. You're bringing forth something. You're expressing something. In the Old Testament, Israel as a nation brought forth a Rahab. She was a harlot, but brought forth a Rahab. and also brought forth a Solomon who was a general officer in the Israeli army that was invading uh the city. And the prophet said in the toolken sea Rahab came right back and courted the general in the army. And she brought forth a famous son. &gt;&gt; And that famous son brought forth another famous son. &gt;&gt; And that son brought forth another famous son until the great famous son came &gt;&gt; right back down through Oed and on through Jesse and on to David who the scripture says was the father of Jesus Christ. Not after the flesh but after the faith. And Matthew 1:1 says, "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham, in the unveiling of God, the prophet says,"Abraham waited 25 years on the child." Those 25 years, friends, were not filled with just delight and joy, and it wasn't a a picnic. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; They were hardships. &gt;&gt; But he was waiting for a son. And God said so and that settled it. The word was there being watered by faith. Listen, he had all kinds of things happening in the physical realm, but the word was there. &gt;&gt; The promise was there &gt;&gt; being watered by faith. &gt;&gt; He believed in the promise that was in his heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Believing it and it brought forth. It brought forth. He didn't bring forth. It brought forth. &gt;&gt; The word brought forth the results &gt;&gt; and it brought forth a son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, we are here in this most critical, desperate age of all times. the most deceptive age even to the point that the things that I'm speaking today almost seem unattainable or it seems that we are almost detached. We can speak about the martyrs and it's such a different world. We can hardly find any association with the martyrs because it was deny your faith or or lose your head. &gt;&gt; And it was a just an instant decision. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. And if you were faced with that this morning, I believe that for the biggest part, most of you would say, "Take my head. I won't deny my faith. I won't deny my convictions. And in a moment, I'll be in glory." &gt;&gt; But this is a much more subtle generation. And we we hardly feel connected with it because of we will come to the pressures and the travail of this age. The in fact is the travail of this age is the pressure of soft living. &gt;&gt; That's a travail. &gt;&gt; It's a problem for us &gt;&gt; because it tries to defeat us. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says also now you have it brought forth. I've come from Rahab and one that famous son brought forth another famous son brought forth another famous son. That was not them saying, "I got to bring forth a famous son." Another one saying, "I got to bring forth a famous son so he can bring forth a famous son." It wasn't them. It was just happening. &gt;&gt; And God was allowing events in the world, events in their time, and events in this time to develop and bring forth the word to its ordained and predestinated place. &gt;&gt; And the best thing you can do to do is recognize I'm here for a purpose. &gt;&gt; And be committed to that purpose. &gt;&gt; Be impressed. As I spoke last Sunday, be impressed &gt;&gt; by the word &gt;&gt; that's amongst us. &gt;&gt; And I believe it was Stephen that was preaching. He said, "And when the time of the promise drew near, &gt;&gt; not when the events of your life happened and when you came to a certain place and when you were educated or you finished your you finished your studies or or when you achieved a certain place in business. It had nothing to do that. It was when the time of the promise drew near &gt;&gt; which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt. They didn't know why they were growing and multiplying in Egypt. It was the word that was causing it. &gt;&gt; Moses brought forth. Moses often in agony, agony of soul, he brought forth a son out of Egypt. Out of Egypt have I called my son. Moses was instrumental in bringing him forth in travail of soul. even to the place he said to God, "I didn't bring all these people. I didn't bring them forth." &gt;&gt; But God said to him, "You brought them forth." &gt;&gt; He said, "I he he knew what he was talking about. He said, "I didn't conceive these children." &gt;&gt; They didn't come out of out of me. I didn't conceive them. But God would not he would not change his program. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in Exodus, he said is Exodus 3:12. And he said, "Certainly I will be with thee, and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee when thou hast brought forth when you have brought forth this people out of Egypt. You shall serve God upon this mountain." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's almost there. I don't have a a scripture or anything in the message, but it's almost as though Egypt was a womb and God just allowed his children to develop and get to a certain place and then the birth couldn't be stopped. It was like the the gates opened up and the children issued out of that place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Moses brought them forth the pangs of birth. And Moses heard the people weep throughout their families in Numbers 11th chapter. Every man in the door of his tent. Every man, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This wasn't a couple people. &gt;&gt; Every man in the door of his tent. And the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly. Moses also was displeased. And Moses said unto the Lord, "Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? Wherefore have you afflicted me? Why am I under such a an agony? And wherefore have I found favor in thy sight that thou layst the burden of all this people upon me? Have I conceived all this people? Have I begotten them that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom?" and as a nursing father beareth a suckling child unto the land which thou swearest unto the fathers. I didn't conceive them. They weren't begotten out of me. How can I carry them? And you say to me, carry them as a as a father carries a suckling child in his bosom and carry them to this land. &gt;&gt; He didn't he couldn't understand everything that was happening. He was human like you and I. And we hear and we en encounter things and we have difficulties in our lives and difficulties in our homes and difficulties. Maybe you young people have difficulties. Listen to brother Biscll this morning. It's because you have come in contact with the word of God and because God puts a seed into your soul and you cannot escape this call. And God doesn't care about the meltdown and the economics and all the financial things and job or no job or this that or the other thing. He's not interested in that. He's interested in one thing. I have I have charged and given you my word and you're going to carry it through this generation. &gt;&gt; And when it's all done, the son of God, Jesus Christ, will be greater glorified. &gt;&gt; This is your purpose of living. This is why you're breathing breath today. &gt;&gt; And all these other things are just to kind of help us through. &gt;&gt; Israel brought forth Israel brought forth an Elizabeth and a Mary. This is collectively speaking. Israel brought them forth. It doesn't even say it refers to their mother and father and who gave them natural life. But that's really where it ends. You've got your mothers and fathers here or someplace in the world. But that that's rather incidental. The real one is you were born again. You received a birth. &gt;&gt; Through Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; Israel brought forth an Elizabeth. &gt;&gt; And she brought forth Isaiah 43 43 and 4. &gt;&gt; She brought forth Isaiah 40 and3 and brought forth Malachi 3 and1. &gt;&gt; Israel brought forth Elizabeth. But Elizabeth brought forth the scripture. She brought forth John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm getting excited, friends. &gt;&gt; The nation or the world or the earth or your families brought forth. You &gt;&gt; brought forth as an Elizabeth, but she brought forth the scripture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Behold, I send my messenger before thy face. That's what she brought forth. Amen. &gt;&gt; She brought forth John the Baptist, &gt;&gt; the voice she brought forth him that crith in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Prepare ye the way of the Lord. That's what came out of her womb, &gt;&gt; and make straight in the desert a highway for my God. Do you folks see where I'm going? &gt;&gt; Do you see where we're going? &gt;&gt; We're going to talk about us right here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your nations, your parents, your countries brought you forth. But you brought forth the word of God. &gt;&gt; You've been given the privilege. You brought forth &gt;&gt; this word, a living word. &gt;&gt; In the pangs of death, in the pangs of birth, Elizabeth brought forth one. Behold, I will send you my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me, one whom Jesus called Elijah. So, Israel brought forth Elizabeth, but Elizabeth brought forth Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you accept that? &gt;&gt; He said, "Among women, there's none born of women that hath risen the greater than John the Baptist. Notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. And then he went on and ended in Matthew 11:14. And if you will receive it, this is Elias or Elijah which was for to come. Israel brought forth Mary. Listen close. Mary brought forth Isaiah 7 and 14. And therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel. Israel brought forth Mary. Mary brought forth Emmanuel. &gt;&gt; Mary brought forth the fullness of the Godhead bodily. Mary brought forth the redeemer that you call the Lord Jesus Christ. Mary brought forth your savior. God brought it forth through her, but she was the instrument. She was the one who travailed. And even then, listen to this friends. Listen, I was shocked when it even came to my thoughts. Even then, she was bringing forth God, the fullness of God bodily. &gt;&gt; God did not lessen the travail of natural birth. &gt;&gt; She still participated in the curse. She was bringing forth the one who was going to deliver the entire world from the curse. But she still had to bear the curse. &gt;&gt; In sorrow. &gt;&gt; In sorrow you shall conceive. &gt;&gt; In sorrow you'll bring forth children. &gt;&gt; And she had the pain. And God didn't lighten the agony &gt;&gt; of the travail. They were under Rome and under taxation. &gt;&gt; And when she was heavy with child, ready to give birth, she experienced what all women experience. which is heavy with child. The scripture says Joseph had to journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem &gt;&gt; 80 miles on a donkey &gt;&gt; with no Hampton ends &gt;&gt; and no delightful places &gt;&gt; and actually had to journey through Samaria which they were enemies with Samaria and there's you could be sure that they didn't receive any kind reception from the Samaritans and she's right in the moments of bringing forth Emmanuel, [Music] &gt;&gt; just one daughter individually of the whole nation of Israel. One woman collectively, but look what she was doing for the whole nation and the whole world. My friends, &gt;&gt; my friends and brothers and sisters in Christ, you are individuals, but you have no concept of what it is you're bringing forth. &gt;&gt; God is going to judge this generation by your life. &gt;&gt; God is going to judge your neighbors, &gt;&gt; by your life, &gt;&gt; because he's going to say, "It wasn't them. You thought it was Susie. You thought it was Mary. You thought it was John. You thought it was Bill, but it was me. &gt;&gt; He's going to judge the people you work by by your life. in your womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus. And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree of Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. I don't know whether Joseph grumbled about it or not. The taxation coming at such an inopportune time. My wife is heavy with child or the woman I'm a spouse to and here I've got to go out in the public. I haven't even taken her to wife yet. She's I'm a spouse to her and God has called her my wife and I'm taking her out in the public heavy with child &gt;&gt; and God had make this journey 80 miles and they say that it took at least a week or more. No bathrooms, no places to comfort zones or comfort stations. What was happening? The word was coming forth in travail. &gt;&gt; Not only physical travail, but the travail of the exterior, the elements of the world. &gt;&gt; But all of those pressures. Listen to me, friends. All of those pressures were only doing one thing. It was bringing forth Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And he's the same yesterday. He's the same in Mary's time. He's the same in August the 28th, 2010. &gt;&gt; It's not your little life and the little circumstances of your life. It's the main purpose you have been sent here and called of Almighty God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there isn't a detail of your life that God is unconcerned about or doesn't know anything about or can't do anything about it. &gt;&gt; And I trust that you'll be as committed to him &gt;&gt; as he is to you. And Joseph went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, unto Judea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be taxed with Mary, his espoused wife, being great with child. And it was so that while they were there, the days were accomplished. She also was a woman, and the woman couldn't wait. because the hour her hour had come &gt;&gt; and here she's caught in all of these circumstances. Uh talk about inconvenient circumstances and there's no place in the end and she ends up with the animals. Don't go home. Take your front room and your kitchen for granted. Even in a day of luxury acc by by their standards we live in the lap of luxury. We have all kinds of things and throw more away in our garbage than they had to eat. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; But it's still Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; At at one time he's considered a good man and the next time he's considered a deceiver. Some some considered him a great teacher. Some people think the message, oh, it's great. I've never heard anything like it. But they they're not committed to it. &gt;&gt; Is this service meaning something to you? &gt;&gt; And it was while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. and she brought forth her firstborn and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end. The people cried out for a Messiah. The prophet of God said, brother Brandham said they cried out for a Messiah and God sent him a baby. &gt;&gt; So he says the world then was falling apart like it is today. Like it is today. Every nation was looking for someone to hold them out of this tragedy. Wouldn't the world love to have Wouldn't the countries of the world love to have say, "Here I am on the scene and I'll lift you out of this terrible economic dilemma, 14 million Americans without work. We'll put everybody to work." Wouldn't that be a messiah? Wouldn't they be a hero in a minute? and say you people that don't have any your economy is down and you people that have civil war here I'm on the scene I'm going to bring peace between the communities. Wouldn't that be something? &gt;&gt; He said for someone to hold them out of this tragedy that was about to strike the world and trying to get get them hold them together. The nations were looking for something and each nation was looking for it, but they looked like they didn't want to accept what God sent them. &gt;&gt; They were asking for a man, a Messiah that would stomp out the rest of the nations, and God gave him a baby. &gt;&gt; Asking for a general, and God gave him a baby. &gt;&gt; But that was God's plan. I'm going to bring a baby forth. I'm going to bring a son forth. It's going to be in travail &gt;&gt; from the outside, from the elements, from natural life, and from the physical yourself, &gt;&gt; the individual. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Under birth pains, under travail, the church brought forth &gt;&gt; the church brought forth Luther. And I tell you friends, if you'd like to be in Luther's companion, you'd be hightailing it with him on horseback in every other way, trying to escape the killing of the people because he was hated, hated, hated. And the greatest power, the pope and the church was after his hide. &gt;&gt; But the church, it couldn't wait. That messenger had to come forth because it was the word of God in the church &gt;&gt; and it had to burst forth and couldn't wait any longer. And Luther had to come &gt;&gt; and his mother travailed in birth. But more than that, he travailed because he was carrying the son of God. &gt;&gt; He was carrying part of the word. &gt;&gt; God give me strength. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word the church brought forth a Wesley and the church brought forth a Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; He says and the and she the church had birth painans. He said under Luther the church had birth painans. And now we know there's seven church ages and seven messengers to them. Church ages according to Revelation. And now when Luther had to come forth, it certainly threw the church into birth pains, but it brought forth a Luther. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And after it got into trouble again, it brought forth a &gt;&gt; Wesley. &gt;&gt; And got forth again, and it brought forth a Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Each of them, the messengers of their age, rock back to the word, the message of their age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. According to the Bible. And can you imagine read in Revelation 1 and there's seven messengers in the right hand and that time came it was Jesus Christ himself and he knew the different station he had to come to age after age and when it came to a certain place there went the first messenger &gt;&gt; and then went the second messenger &gt;&gt; and then went the third messenger and on and on until he only has one in his hand. Oh, I love this scene. Christ Emmanuel himself. One in his hand left him and Elijah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's always been that way. &gt;&gt; Him and Elijah. &gt;&gt; When he came down to be baptized, it was him and Elijah. &gt;&gt; When the great multitudes were coming, it was him and Elijah was in jail. &gt;&gt; This gospel, don't take it lightly. It's still dripping with blood. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And you young people, you young fellas and young ladies that maybe don't think this is associated with you, God's going to actually stand and hold you accountable for what you're hearing today. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; God trying to get a message to you. God the Messiah Jesus Christ and Elijah and the and the conditions of the world were developing and uh and the earth's gone into a incredible birth pain and gas and mustard gas. My wife's daddy was in that war. Well, people fell right in the trenches beside him and uh and when one of his buddies said, "I feel it. I'm going to I feel I'm going to get it today." And he got killed right beside him. And and and her uncle was in that war. And those two men came out. Her daddy, my wife's daddy, had to come out because he was carrying the seed of this woman. That was to be my wife &gt;&gt; and to be an example to many others. &gt;&gt; He could not. God protected. It wasn't him. It wasn't his gun or bullets. &gt;&gt; And God protected your parents wherever they were to bring you on the scene because you're part of the word of God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I want you to recognize who that word is. It's Christ. Jesus Christ. the same one that was in the womb of Mary. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's who it is. &gt;&gt; I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed &gt;&gt; with the word &gt;&gt; that's in our midst. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "When the people cry out for a prophet, God sends them one." &gt;&gt; God only sends his prophets when the people wants a prophet. God sends a sign when the people are ready. &gt;&gt; And when God sends a sign and when they don't want it, he said, he said, "Then they don't want it." He does send a sign and then they don't want it. So it's hid from the eyes of the wise and the prudent but revealed unto babes. &gt;&gt; He said in a true sign that's over overlooked. Overlooked. A true sign that's overlooked. Let the people call for a prophet. God will put one on the scene. I challenge the nations to do that. Fall on your face and call on God to send a deliverer and watch what happens. But there was something within the people that were crying out. Pentecost of 1906 uh and the great Isuza Street revival uh was had had broken and and the gospel was spreading over the globe. But there was something in the people because it was it was drifting from the genuiness and the power of that early Pentecost. It was already drifting and there was something in the people. But the earth who knew nothing about the gospel there, their boys are going to war and they're fighting in Europe. They're fighting in Russia. They're fighting in the Philippines. They're fighting in uh down in uh in uh uh not Vietnam, but in that in that in that area of Indochina, which it was at that time. They're fighting. and the Burma road was built and the Alaska Highway was built and they're fighting uh Japan and China just finished war and they're the troops are moving now the Japanese have are moving up the Illusian Islands coming right towards Alaska and Alaska has no no defense by way of road and there has to be a road built. You want to get if you want to see something, you young people where brother Ed lived, you go, they just had their 50-year celebration some time ago and they've put out de DVDs of the Alaskan the building of the Alaskan Highway. You'll see part of the travail troops froze to death and uh and the incredible expense that America went through to build a a land route from Canada to Alaska. And it was I thought it was in nine months. I've been reading up on it a wee bit some time ago. They actually put through 1,523 miles, not kilometers, miles. 1,523 miles in 7 months. Our cities and so on can't build a road for 10 miles in seven months. But war, why did they do that? Because the earth was in a birth pain. &gt;&gt; We might lose Alaska &gt;&gt; and Pearl Harbor's been bombed. And the earth is in a You might say, "Well, that's history." Listen, that's not what the prophet says. He said it's a birth pain. &gt;&gt; And a birth pain indicates something is coming forth from it. &gt;&gt; And something is coming forth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I think I've been clear and I still have more to say, &gt;&gt; but I want to say to all who have not seen those days, there's a new world going to be birthed. &gt;&gt; There's a new heaven and a new earth. &gt;&gt; And I feel under the responsibility to ask you as you're sitting here, are you going to be in it? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's more real than the one you're in today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And these birth painans are bringing forth a new world. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And this last messenger is a sign of it. &gt;&gt; The first world war is a sign of it. The second world war is a sign of it. And all the events that have happened since are all pointing towards the same thing. There's a new heaven and a new earth coming. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm here today to expend my breath and my energy to to say to you, are you going to be in it? &gt;&gt; Make your calling and election sure. &gt;&gt; You're not just going to, you know, float into it. You're not going into it on mother and dad's coattails. You're not going into it because you're associated or, you know, brother Biscll or Brother Ray or anybody else. You're not going in it because of that. You're going in it because you've been birthed yourself. [Applause] [Music] you young people and even children and experience the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The author of creation. I hope you can don't consider me off my rocker. I've pointed to these things over the years, but now I'm perhaps going to say it just a wee bit clearer. The author, the people cry out for a prophet. The people cry out for a messenger. The people cry out for a Messiah. And the prophet says, "God sends them one, &gt;&gt; but they don't recognize it." And God sends them the sign, but they don't recognize the sign. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The author of creation speaking in Revelation. He won't turn to it. I'm just going to refer to it. I think I have it a little further on. to our messenger. This was his commission. And under the angel of the church unto William Brandham in other words of the Leodysians, write &gt;&gt; send this letter &gt;&gt; to this messenger. &gt;&gt; These things saith the amen. I'm the amen. &gt;&gt; I'm the so be it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm the final word. &gt;&gt; The faithful and true witness. &gt;&gt; This is truth. &gt;&gt; And no wonder the prophet would say, "Is that true? Is that true? Is that true? Is what I've said is that true?" &gt;&gt; Because it was the spirit of truth. &gt;&gt; It was this one speaking through him. And further he goes on to say the beginning, listen, the beginning of the creation of God. Not that he was the first to be created as some think. Brother Brandham clarifies that. Makes it very very clear. But that he was the beginning. He was the author of creation. &gt;&gt; And now he's saying to his messenger, I am the author. &gt;&gt; I'm the beginning and the end. I'm him that was dead and am alive. forever more. And this is who's speaking to you. I'm the alpha and the omega. I am the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; And when he says that, he describes, I know your works, etc. I will say it's the author of creation speaking through the prophet, his mouthpiece. And that I'm I'm skipping a whole big segment of life, what I could describe of brother Brandham's life. and and our our our relationship to it. But he speaks through his prophet mouthpiece and creates for himself his own bride. &gt;&gt; He's created all things. &gt;&gt; He created by the word of God. &gt;&gt; I can show you in a scripture clearly where Jesus Christ came physically into the womb of Mary. But first the words and promise of the prophets came into her mind and she believed what the angel said and she believed the word of God. And the prophet says the words of the prophets anchored in her womb. &gt;&gt; And I'm coming right straight out today to say have and I will say it. They have they have the words of the prophets and the word of this prophet. And the promise for this age has anchored into the virgin womb of the mind of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The word, the promise has anchored into the womb. And that's that word that's going to bring forth. &gt;&gt; Let me say it even more plainly. The word that is anchored in the virgin womb of the mind of the bride of Jesus Christ. It is that word that's going to bring forth a new heaven and a new earth. &gt;&gt; The new heaven and the new earth already at this moment is resident in the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's not something that's going to drop from the skies. It's something that's already here. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is within you. The kingdom of God is within you. &gt;&gt; And that's a kingdom that's going to rule and reign in that time. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Now, who are you? &gt;&gt; Now, who is the bride of Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Now, do you recognize who he is? &gt;&gt; Now, do you recognize the son that dwells in you? &gt;&gt; The alpha, the omega, the beginning and the end, the resurrection himself lives in the bride of Jesus Christ. The rapture is in the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; A new world &gt;&gt; is in the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How can the church sit still at such words? &gt;&gt; And they've anchored in the womb. &gt;&gt; Already anchored in the womb. &gt;&gt; You believe it because you cannot do anything else. &gt;&gt; And the season has arrived. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says he's standing speaking of Christ. He's standing in the midst of the church. And as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age. He calls himself the author of the creation of God. This is another creation. This has to do with the church. &gt;&gt; This is a special designation of himself. He is the creator of that church. &gt;&gt; The heavenly bridegroom created his own bride. &gt;&gt; Now say, God sent his own prophet Elijah &gt;&gt; on the scene. Elijah, I trust you. You're the last one. Prophet says, "You're the most faithful spirit &gt;&gt; of the prophets." The Elijah, he's the one that restored. He's the one who said, "Oh God, let it be known that I have spoken your word and I am your servant and send fire down." Fire came out of the heavens. &gt;&gt; The same spirit in this time. &gt;&gt; You know what the problem is? Satan has made this world made it so easy &gt;&gt; that you can just go home and click click click and stick something in your ear. and because of that. &gt;&gt; I don't know if I have any time. &gt;&gt; I'm real busy. &gt;&gt; And this one that God himself sent to the prophet of God, we've got much more time for other things of this world. It's a trap. It's a travail &gt;&gt; to take the time by force and and the righteous and to take it by force. &gt;&gt; We take it from the enemy. &gt;&gt; You're not going to rob me of this voice. You're not going to rob me of these promises. They've anchored into my soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The bride possesses it already. &gt;&gt; It's already anchored in the womb of your mind. &gt;&gt; You can't even get rid of it. God anchored it there. &gt;&gt; And before he anchored it there, he took out all denominational trash. &gt;&gt; He purged you. &gt;&gt; You trinitarians and you that believed all kinds of false stuff. And God cleanse you of man because man's seed cannot be there with his seed. &gt;&gt; And when he cleansed you, he said you're virgin. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; You're not just forgiven. You're virgin. &gt;&gt; I'm going to put my word &gt;&gt; into your virgin womb of your mind. And I'm going to anchor it there. &gt;&gt; And it's going to bring forth the promise &gt;&gt; of the new heaven &gt;&gt; and a new earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're my wife. &gt;&gt; And I flip the finger of unmmerited grace. On your finger, the ring. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we're going to walk out together in a new heaven and a new earth. I'm going to renovate this one &gt;&gt; by the same power that you possess. Lord, &gt;&gt; I hope you're getting what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; And in this day, the scripture fulfilled. In this day, the scriptures fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Listen to what's fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Sunday afternoon, he said, "I got up to speak. I was going to take my text on birth pains &gt;&gt; where Jesus said that as a woman in travail with a child, she's travailing in birth. And so I was going to speak from there as birth pains, saying that the world is in birth pains now. God had his Elijah &gt;&gt; and was telling him, "Tell the people there's birth, the earth is in birth pains now." And it wasn't a war. It wasn't that millions were getting slain. It's a different birth pain. It was pains because Satan was putting all of his lather and all of his uh you know all of his flattering words and trying to persuade people and he was convincing the Lutheran and the Baptists and the Pentecostals and all of them come in and saying to the Pentecostals look there the Catholics are even speaking in tongues. Yeah. Oh. So the the all the priests and everyone come in and God's a messenger standing behind the pulpit with Catholic priests behind him handing him a Bible to read out of and they were just lathering it all up and sucked them all in and the prophet say you're in a birth pain &gt;&gt; and you don't know it. &gt;&gt; You're going to a slaughter &gt;&gt; and you think you're going to a revival. you're going to a slaughter. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And his soul bled, his soul hungered, his soul craved &gt;&gt; for a people. &gt;&gt; But God cheered his heart. He saw a bride coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He saw a bride coming. &gt;&gt; The one that would be pregnantated by the seed. &gt;&gt; The word of God. Thus say the Lord coming out of the prophet's mouth pregnant her [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; I say to you married woman you married woman you wife of Jesus Christ you're on your way home &gt;&gt; you're on your way home &gt;&gt; you're on your way home that's what this is all about &gt;&gt; that's why you're going through what you're going through on your way home Under every prophet's message, &gt;&gt; Israel got a birth pain because these prophets would come on the scene. &gt;&gt; After the theologians and clergymen would have have the church in all organization form when the prophets came on the scene, thus said the Lord, they shook them churches and she had a birth pain. And finally she had birth painans plum on up until she delivered a son of the gospel which was the word himself made flesh. And I want to tell you the birth painans that the earth had gave birth. It was the it was out of the collectively the earth gave birth to a son of the gospel in this case called a prophet of God. He had to come on the scene first with the spirit of Elijah on him. It was not it it was not just Ella and whatever Brandham that gave birth to him. It was God himself that caused that seed to come on down in America and in one sense gave us a prophet. But God gave us a prophet. God gave us Elijah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was no one else. It was God Almighty. Why? Because it was time for Luke 17:30. Jesus Christ the son had to be revealed. &gt;&gt; He'd come to He had to He had to be issued out. &gt;&gt; He had to come. &gt;&gt; Nothing could hold it back. &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30 had been in gestation for all of these centuries and and he had come to a forming point and he could not be held back any longer. and he gushed out into the earth &gt;&gt; with signs and wonders and miracles exactly as he did 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Say it, Brother Roy. &gt;&gt; I know it's registering. &gt;&gt; Let the people of the Lord say so. &gt;&gt; The word is anchored in the womb of my mind. &gt;&gt; I believe it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this prophet came with this prophet came with promises. &gt;&gt; Promises. &gt;&gt; And it's those promises that have anchored. &gt;&gt; It was not William Bratton speaking. It was God himself speaking. It was Jesus Christ who commissioned him. You take this message &gt;&gt; and you speak it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why do you think it's anchoring in the hearts of people? Why do you think it's happening and moving so quickly? I took about 2, three minutes. I said to brother Murphy, you're going to be translating. I want you to get the direction I'm going. It's a very important message. And oh, he said, you've already you're already preaching to me. He was just already getting it within about 3, four minutes. I said, uh, what's happening in those countries? What's happening in Serbia and all those countries? I can tell you what brother Tom faced in Serbia is a it's light years away from what we had many years ago. You you're preaching in the Baptist church trying to find one trying to find one here, trying to find one there. But there's an elect body of believers today. And why are they a stable bunch of believers? Because the word is anchored in the virgin womb of their mind. &gt;&gt; And that word is specific. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the scripture says the virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son and the prophet said that word, that promise anchored in her womb. Don't take that as just some poetic thing. It anchored in her womb &gt;&gt; and she brought forth the son &gt;&gt; because that's what the promise called about. &gt;&gt; And when the prophet of God comes in this day and prepares a bride, wait till 1964 and then speaks to us speaks to you about future home. That's not for the world. They're not going there. You're going home, friends. You're going home. &gt;&gt; And God sent this messenger to describe your home &gt;&gt; and how to get there and to tell you who it is &gt;&gt; that is in you now. &gt;&gt; We can say it's a promise. I can say it's Christ. Help me just finish now. Now Christ when he came on the scene, the Bible says, who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers, he did, he still does, and supplications and strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death. and was heard in that he feared. That's still Christ today. You still have that. We have people and some are more given to it than others because the spirit has called them to a place of prayer and supplication &gt;&gt; and strong tears and crying. Why was he having that? Because the elements of the world were in direct opposition. But it was what was in him which was the word that was thrusting him forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why Jesus said, "I must go &gt;&gt; to Jerusalem." &gt;&gt; And you can say, "I must go to the future home. I must go. This world is not my home. I'm just a passing through. My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue." That's what the songwriter said because they didn't understand it completely. But my treasures are laid up just beyond this realm. &gt;&gt; You can go back to your car and back to your home and drive down the black top freeway or whatever more, but that's just for this moment. &gt;&gt; And those things give you a lot of travail. &gt;&gt; Some of you in it even now. &gt;&gt; What am I going to study? And where am I going from here? And I've just graduated and now what happens? And how how do I how do I manage? What do I how do I make my way through life? That's the travail. That's the journey part. &gt;&gt; You're journeying through it, friends. &gt;&gt; But I've been sent here today to tell you &gt;&gt; the travail and your travel. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said travel is a better word. Right. &gt;&gt; Travel is a better word because it's as you travel &gt;&gt; and you come under from one day to another under the pangs. Remember the pangs are only there because the sun has come to a certain place. &gt;&gt; The development has come to a certain condition &gt;&gt; and it's ready to be issued out. He's ready. You say what to the son of David. who will reign in the millennium &gt;&gt; while you are at a marriage supper. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're giving birth. He has to to reach the glory a further glory of what his purpose is. Let me finish now please. Just a moment. In choosing of a bride, I'll say the promises for this day. These are my notes. The promises for this day spoken by God's prophet messenger have lodged into the womb of the mind of the virgin bride and she will bring forth. The promise for this day was lodged. The travail that we experience will bring forth a millennium reign &gt;&gt; with the son of David on the throne. &gt;&gt; In choosing a bride, he said the other the others pregnant by the word of God, speaking of the bride and will bring forth the body, the finished body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The finished body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can I perhaps say it this way, friends? There's only seven messengers. There's only seven messages. &gt;&gt; And God has put the conclusion in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is not the beginning. This is a conclusion. You have the opportunity [Music] &gt;&gt; and I'm your brother. But if you disdain it, if you think little of it and say, "Well, I really don't care. I really haven't got time. I think that's too deep for me." Don't let it be too deep for you. &gt;&gt; You got the concluding message in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have the You possess a conclusion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the conclusion possesses the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Has that lodged in the womb of your mind? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll be changed &gt;&gt; in a moment. In the twinkling, you can say, "My Elijah, my prophet, told me about a home I'm going to. He told me that the heavens are going to be on fire. Apostle Peter told me the heavens are going to be on fire." And the prophet came and detailed it. He said, "All the demons &gt;&gt; and evil spirits, &gt;&gt; the one that are walking around your home, the one that are walking around your life, God is going to burn them up in a holy fire. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. Even so, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even so, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come. You've heard it and I leave you with it. &gt;&gt; May God help you &gt;&gt; to take this with this seriousness that the Holy Spirit has brought it. &gt;&gt; I have much more that I could have said, but I feel that this is the end. This is as far as I am going to go. That wasn't to make you feel good, not to make you think more of yourself than you ought to. &gt;&gt; But to let you know &gt;&gt; what it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a real The gospel's always been real. &gt;&gt; People bored in a real way. Yes. &gt;&gt; You women that have bored children, let me just say it to you. Even with Emmanuel, even with God in the flesh, even with the son of the living God coming forth, the fullness of the Godhead bodily, yet she had to ride heavy with child and we're journeying. That was her journey. &gt;&gt; That was their travail. &gt;&gt; Right? Don't whimper over the little trials we go through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Rejoice &gt;&gt; because the son, you're having the pain because the son is coming to his fullness. &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about. &gt;&gt; The travail in the world is upon us because the son is desiring to be birthed. [Music] So nice to hear your rejoice. &gt;&gt; I don't need it, but I'm just glad it's ringing down deep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why don't we just stand for a moment? &gt;&gt; And if you feel like you'd like to say glory to God, &gt;&gt; just do so. &gt;&gt; This the house of God. &gt;&gt; Feel perfectly liberty. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Scream, shout, thank him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Raise your hands. &gt;&gt; Clap your hands. Whatever you want to do, &gt;&gt; give him glory. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

I love the message that went in it. &gt;&gt; I even said, "Brother John, do you speak Chinese?" He said, "Well, I've learned a little bit." so he could manage to eat and get by and carried those books there and stood outside the outside the government uh uh government churches and handed them out and they all thought it was part of the official program and now churches are there and people and the word is being spread. And I say glory, glory, glory. Hallelujah. The elector are coming in. We have a great reward, Brother John. You have a great reward. And God has done great things for Brother John and his body.

In the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we just dedicate ourselves to you. Aresh, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] I just feel as brother John was praying maybe there's someone you want to be man woman enough just to say I'm not really committed I haven't been really committed but God has spoke to me this morning I'd like this congregation to pray for me and as is a man.

Oh father, I pray that there will be that you will you will now achieve what it is that you've spoken to them for a purpose and you've moved upon them.
