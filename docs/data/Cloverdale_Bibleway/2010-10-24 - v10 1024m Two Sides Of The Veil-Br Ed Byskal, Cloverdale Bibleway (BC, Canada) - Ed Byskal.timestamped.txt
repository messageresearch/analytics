[31:25] when a preacher can come and get
[31:27] blessed.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that's really special. So,
[31:31] we're thankful for our brother, uh, Ron
[31:34] Spencer, and he certainly has a pretty
[31:37] heavy schedule. He just came back from
[31:39] Saskatchewan, and in another week or
[31:42] two, he's going to be in Calgary.
[31:44] So, I told him if he keeps that up,
[31:46] we're going to have to get him dual
[31:47] citizenship. So, he'll be at home in
[31:51] Canada as well as the United States. So,
[31:54] God bless him. And we want to pray for
[31:56] these ministers, you know, that are out
[31:59] and they're going from early morning to
[32:02] late at night a lot of these places. I
[32:05] uh also had a email from brother Dioa
[32:09] and he's some distance right now from
[32:11] Kenshasa having having rest after the
[32:14] convention and the meetings that they've
[32:16] been in. And I can tell you it's uh you
[32:18] know we don't have the same conditions
[32:21] there aren't the same conditions in so
[32:23] many of these places that there are here
[32:25] and people are under uh under extreme
[32:29] you know physical endurance. Uh brother
[32:31] Murphy I can just well imagine I know
[32:33] what it is a wee bit and I'm glad I'm
[32:36] not there because it takes someone his
[32:39] age to be able to get up and go from
[32:41] early morning till late at night day
[32:44] after day after day. That's why when you
[32:47] see these brothers come back, brother,
[32:50] brother brother Timothy Maw, he'll be in
[32:51] the middle of it right now, having left
[32:53] last Monday.
[32:56] And I can assure you that these brothers
[32:58] certainly
[32:59] uh just for them to know there's a
[33:02] congregation of people praying, somebody
[33:05] is speaking their name before the throne
[33:07] of God, it just does something. So will
[33:10] you do that? Amen.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; How many have an opportunity to read at
[33:15] least part of the faith challenge
[33:16] report?
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's wonderful. Wonderful. Those
[33:20] of you that haven't yet, you want to be
[33:23] sure that you just take it and when you
[33:25] do, read it prayerfully and pray for
[33:28] those that are, you saw quite a number
[33:31] of people there. Those are people who
[33:33] are are burdened for the Lord's work and
[33:36] for God's people. and were burdened for
[33:40] other people just like you. If they were
[33:42] sitting right with you today, you'd feel
[33:44] just you'd feel so happy that you'd have
[33:49] such brothers and sisters. And if you
[33:52] had somebody sitting beside you that
[33:54] walked all day yesterday
[33:56] &gt;&gt; to come to this service and you drove up
[33:59] in your nice warm car, air conditioned
[34:01] and all the rest of it, you'd say, "What
[34:04] a privilege." this sister, this brother,
[34:06] they they spent all day yesterday
[34:08] walking to get here. And uh and God's
[34:11] got those people and we are what we are.
[34:14] We're living where we live, but we want
[34:16] to be dedicated people to the Lord. So,
[34:19] we're thankful for these uh for these
[34:21] different ones. Also, Brother Jacques
[34:24] from Poland
[34:26] and uh we're Lord willing, we're going
[34:28] to join with him. Brother Kim has
[34:30] already been in contact with him and
[34:34] we're going to get him a printer just as
[34:36] quickly as possible. There's a
[34:38] convention taking place in u in either
[34:41] uh Holland or Belgium uh very soon and
[34:45] we want to get a a print station there
[34:48] and then they will send somebody up or
[34:50] have some people coming up and we'll be
[34:52] able to pick it up. So, there just so
[34:55] many different unique and wonderful ways
[34:57] to to be able to make these provisions.
[35:00] Um,
[35:02] Brother Kim had a had a wonderful thing
[35:05] happen this week and just telling us a
[35:08] little bit of the testimony. Brother
[35:09] Kim, you're the only one that can tell
[35:11] that testimony. So, I want you to come
[35:13] up and and just tell the folks what
[35:15] happened.
[35:18] Amen.
[35:22] I know Kim loves being called up, so
[35:31] well, I appreciate all that have been
[35:33] helping at the school next door working.
[35:36] And uh those of you who worked there,
[35:38] it's it's a simple little testimony, but
[35:40] it meant something to me yesterday. Um
[35:42] those of you that were working there
[35:44] knew that about three weeks ago, I had a
[35:46] drill that was taken from the job site.
[35:48] It was quite an expensive tool about
[35:51] $600 or $700
[35:53] and about three weeks ago went missing
[35:55] on the job site and I was quite
[35:56] disappointed and I talked to brother
[35:58] Randy and he got a quote how much it's
[35:59] going to cost and it's almost $700 and I
[36:02] just couldn't bear to part with $700 to
[36:05] buy a new tool. So I've been doing
[36:06] without. Yesterday, uh, my son and I,
[36:09] Ben, were working just to finish off the
[36:11] plumbing on the on the basement. And
[36:14] each day I've been taking my shoes off
[36:16] and leaving them in the truck, Milco's
[36:18] truck, that that he's left for us to
[36:20] use. I use it like a tool cabinet. And
[36:22] uh, so all day long we're going back and
[36:25] forth for parts. And at the end of the
[36:27] day, Ben left a little earlier than I
[36:29] did. At the end of the day, I go to put
[36:31] my shoes back on. And there's my drill
[36:34] sitting right on top of my shoes.
[36:35] Whoever took it brought it back
[36:37] yesterday.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; So, if you're here, I want to say thank
[36:41] you.
[36:45] And if you're not here, well, we'll pray
[36:47] for you that you will be. Amen.
[36:58] Who says conviction doesn't work?
[37:02] Fact is, Brother Kim, maybe we could
[37:05] just, uh, go to prayer. Whoever prayed,
[37:07] maybe we should go to prayer a second
[37:08] time, have that person come back and
[37:10] work.
[37:12] We could probably use it. Well, uh,
[37:15] praise the Lord. Now, just a couple more
[37:17] items. Next Sunday, Brother Peter Ivanko
[37:21] is going to speak next Sunday evening,
[37:23] and you want to all be here and and just
[37:25] make an effort. All all the folks that
[37:27] sometime don't come on Sunday evening,
[37:29] you just make an effort. I know you can
[37:31] come. Amen. And uh if you're not laying
[37:34] at death's door, be here. And even if
[37:37] you are laying at death's door, come and
[37:38] we'll pray for you.
[37:42] Amen. Uh and and we're really happy. And
[37:45] then because all the saints from Seattle
[37:48] are going to be up for the Sunday
[37:49] morning service and stay through the day
[37:51] and uh so some of you also can be
[37:53] prepared if you want to make some
[37:55] arrangements or put on an extra uh pot
[37:58] of soup or something. I know that it's
[38:00] nice for the people to be able to just
[38:02] go and put their feet up and and be in a
[38:04] home. It's really wonderful. And then as
[38:08] we did make announcement, uh we're
[38:10] making it well ahead of time. Uh brother
[38:15] brother Tim Dodd will be here the 19th,
[38:18] 20th, and the 21st. That's a Friday, uh
[38:22] Saturday, and Sunday. Two services.
[38:24] That'll be four services. And it is a
[38:25] special series. And I heard just a small
[38:28] part of it and the and a few of you were
[38:30] able to hear a part of it and it was
[38:33] really remarkable. It is it's a real
[38:35] indepth study uh along the lines and I
[38:38] would say what what I've been speaking
[38:40] on regarding the soul and the spirit uh
[38:43] he's done an in-depth study and it's
[38:45] really wonderful. It it's beneficial.
[38:47] It's something that I think will benefit
[38:49] absolutely everybody. There will be no
[38:52] Wednesday service that week uh which
[38:55] will be 19th 7 19th 18th 17th
[39:00] uh and then we'll be going four week
[39:04] four services on the weekend.
[39:07] Amen. All right. Uh I I would like to
[39:11] sing that chorus. Brother Ryan, uh
[39:17] he's the only one. No one else. I have
[39:20] no one else will do.
[39:25] Can't you read my mind?
[39:29] Uh there is no one.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; There never is no one like you.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[39:36] Let's just stand as we sing it together.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Like you
[39:44] Jesus. No, no one else can touch my
[39:49] heart like you.
[39:54] I could search for all eternity,
[39:58] Lord,
[40:00] and find
[40:02] there is none like you.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Once again, a prayer. Now the prayer.
[40:10] There is none like you.
[40:14] [Music]
[40:18] No one else can touch my heart like you
[40:22] do.
[40:25] I can search for all eternity
[40:31] and find
[40:33] there is
[40:35] [Music]
[40:41] our precious Lord Jesus. as shepherd of
[40:44] the flock, the good shepherd.
[40:48] We want to say collectively today, there
[40:52] is none like you. You have led us into
[40:55] shady green pastures. You've led us by
[40:58] still waters.
[41:00] Our souls have been refreshed, oh quad.
[41:04] You've been so good,
[41:06] wondrous, and wondrous you are, Lord, to
[41:10] us. We just feel our words fail us. Our
[41:13] thoughts even fail us in trying to
[41:16] express to you how wonderful you are.
[41:19] Glory,
[41:21] hallelujah.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Worship and honor.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; We exalt your name
[41:27] &gt;&gt; the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Every
[41:29] knee will bow and every tongue will
[41:31] confess. And we're here, Lord, willingly
[41:33] confessing.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; And willingly bowing before you.
[41:38] Father, I pray that you will send now
[41:40] forth your Holy Spirit in a special
[41:42] measure upon speaker and hearers alike,
[41:46] upon those on the internet, oh God,
[41:48] wherever the service at this moment is
[41:51] being heard. Bless, I pray, and fill
[41:54] every place, oh God. May there be a
[41:56] special portion as the people surrender
[41:59] and give themselves to you. anoint oh
[42:02] God and may your words be transmitted
[42:05] Lord through yielded and human vessels I
[42:08] pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
[42:12] Amen.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[42:18] Thank you. If you'd like to turn in your
[42:20] Bible to Hebrews the 10th chapter,
[42:24] we're going to read a number of verses
[42:26] starting with verse five.
[42:31] Hebrews 10
[42:33] starting with verse 5.
[42:40] Wherefore when he cometh into the world,
[42:42] he saith, sacrifice an offering, thou
[42:45] wst not, but a body hast thou prepared
[42:48] me? In burnt offerings and sacrifices
[42:52] for sin, thou hast had no pleasure.
[42:55] Then said I, Lo, I come in the volume of
[43:00] the book, it is written of me to do thy
[43:02] will, oh God, above when he said,
[43:05] sacrifice and offering and burnt
[43:07] offerings and offering for sin thou
[43:09] wouldst not, neither hast pleasure
[43:13] therein, which are offered by the law.
[43:16] Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will,
[43:19] oh God. He taketh away the first, that
[43:23] he may establish the second.
[43:25] by the which we are sanctified through
[43:28] the offering of the body of Jesus Christ
[43:31] once for all.
[43:34] And every priest standeth daily
[43:36] ministering and offering off times the
[43:39] same sacrifices which can never take
[43:41] away sin.
[43:43] But this man, after he had offered one
[43:46] sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on
[43:50] the right hand of God, and from
[43:53] henceforth expecting till his enemies be
[43:57] made his foottool.
[43:59] For by one offering he hath perfected
[44:01] forever them that are sanctified,
[44:04] &gt;&gt; whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness
[44:06] to us. For after that he had said
[44:10] before, "This is the covenant that I
[44:13] will make with them after those days,
[44:15] said the Lord. I will put my laws into
[44:18] their hearts." And the people can say,
[44:19] "Amen."
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; And in their minds
[44:22] &gt;&gt; will I write them.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; And their sins and iniquities will I
[44:26] remember no more.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Uh now where remission of of these is,
[44:32] there is no more offering for sin.
[44:35] Having therefore, brethren, boldness to
[44:38] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[44:40] Jesus, by a new and living way, which he
[44:44] hath consecrated for us through the
[44:47] veil, that is to say, his flesh.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[44:59] So now you're sitting as recipients and
[45:02] we'll sit if you would please just as
[45:06] attentive as you can because sometimes
[45:08] it's hard to convey
[45:11] uh in in continuity
[45:15] what we'd really like to convey.
[45:18] Amen.
[45:20] Amen.
[45:22] I want to speak to you on something that
[45:26] I've been thinking about and this is uh
[45:29] more or less an extension as I spoke a
[45:32] number of weeks ago. I spoke on the book
[45:34] of life and the lamb's book of life and
[45:37] how one folds out to the other. I I want
[45:40] to speak on the two sides of the inner
[45:43] veil.
[45:45] And for those of you that have uh never
[45:49] read the inner veil,
[45:51] I urge you to do it this week.
[45:54] Those of you that have read it and read
[45:56] it many times, I urge you to get it,
[46:00] obtain a copy and read it very very
[46:03] slowly and prayerfully.
[46:05] Uh the two sides of the inner veil. Now
[46:09] we know that in the tabernacle there was
[46:12] an outer court. There was actually two
[46:14] veils, but there was an outer court
[46:18] and then there was a inner court and
[46:21] then there was the holy of holies. And
[46:24] there was a veil between the the inner
[46:28] court and the holy of holies and the
[46:32] outer court. And and actually God was
[46:34] describing when he told Moses to make
[46:37] this, God was actually describing and
[46:40] having Moses make a replica of what God
[46:43] had already made when he made Adam. He
[46:47] made him with a body which was the outer
[46:50] court. He made him with a spirit and
[46:53] that whole emotional realm which was the
[46:56] inner court. And he made him with a
[46:59] soul. And those are the three realms.
[47:02] Now,
[47:05] uh the the outer court and the inner
[47:08] court and the holy of holies. But now
[47:10] there's a veil between the that veiled
[47:15] God. And it veiled the Holy of Holies.
[47:19] And in the holy of holies was the ark of
[47:24] the covenant which had only the word of
[47:27] God in it on two tablets of stone.
[47:30] Later they put the ma a a golden pot of
[47:34] mana in that uh beside the uh word and
[47:40] Aaron's rod that had budded. And of
[47:43] course there's a significant reason for
[47:45] that is because the mana outside now the
[47:49] mana is is essentially the word and the
[47:52] mana outside that fell and they gathered
[47:56] in the morning God also gave commandment
[47:58] don't carry that over don't try to store
[48:01] that up and have some for the next day
[48:04] because it stank and bred worms and so
[48:07] it is it's very evident that this this
[48:10] is the word of God but if you try to
[48:12] live by the law. Uh it won't be a
[48:15] fragrant life
[48:17] &gt;&gt; because you can't live by the law.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; And so it also indicates you see there's
[48:22] just layers of meaning and depth in the
[48:25] word and and so the manner refers to the
[48:28] word but you cannot as as the prophet
[48:31] said Moses couldn't come with Noah's
[48:33] message and Jesus couldn't come with mo
[48:36] Moses message and we can't come with
[48:39] Luther's message. We have a message for
[48:42] this hour.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; And so when when God also told Moses to
[48:48] gather some mana and put it in a golden
[48:51] pot and put it in the ark, then that
[48:55] mana it remained good
[48:58] &gt;&gt; in the presence in the presence of the
[49:01] almighty God.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Nothing nothing deteriorated. It always
[49:06] remained sweet and and and good. and the
[49:10] and the rod of uh Aaron, which was just
[49:13] a stick
[49:15] when they had a when they had an
[49:16] uprising, they took all the chiefs uh
[49:20] and the rods of the princes uh of the
[49:23] leaders of the 12 tribes and said,
[49:25] "Bring those and lay it before the word
[49:28] and the one that has buds and the one
[49:31] that is different than all the others."
[49:34] Uh that's the one I'm speaking with and
[49:36] that was Aaron's rod. But we don't want
[49:38] to get into that. But we want to think
[49:40] uh for a a few moments now of the veils.
[49:44] I gave a list of things that were veiled
[49:48] uh in the message and in the word of God
[49:50] last time, but I just want to focus on
[49:52] on a few. So I will I will uh give it in
[49:56] this order. God was veiled, excuse me,
[49:59] in a pillar of fire. He was veiled in a
[50:03] whirlwind.
[50:05] He was veiled in the veil veil behind
[50:07] the temple in the veil in the temple.
[50:12] The the it speaks of the veil of the
[50:15] shikina glory.
[50:18] Uh brother Brandham said God was veiled
[50:21] in Moses. He was also veiled in all of
[50:24] the prophets
[50:25] &gt;&gt; because they had the word. The word
[50:27] comes to the prophet and the word is
[50:29] Christ
[50:31] &gt;&gt; and the prophet was the veil. And
[50:33] brother Brandham says that very clearly.
[50:35] The prophets's the veil.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; And he said the veil has always been the
[50:39] problem.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; It's not the God behind the veil, but
[50:43] it's the veil. Because if you don't
[50:45] understand the veil, you'll never you'll
[50:47] never you'll never understand God. And
[50:50] so he was veiled in the prophets. He's
[50:53] veiled in human flesh today.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; And that's still the problem
[50:58] &gt;&gt; because we have a hard time recognizing
[51:00] that. So he's veiled in human flesh.
[51:03] He's veiled in the body of Jesus Christ.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, God was hid when
[51:10] he was on the mercy seat. He was hid by
[51:13] a veil. He said that there he would meet
[51:17] and speak with the people.
[51:20] In the New Testament, the Bible tells us
[51:22] that the Greeks wanted to see Jesus.
[51:26] And they came to the disciples, I
[51:27] believe, to Philillip and said, "We
[51:29] would see Jesus." And brother Bram
[51:30] speaks on it so many times because it
[51:33] has direct reference to his own life and
[51:35] ministry.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; The Greeks wanted to see God. And
[51:39] brother Brandham said, "And here he was,
[51:42] &gt;&gt; but they couldn't see him because of the
[51:44] veil. Jesus was masked to the Greeks."
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Says, "We'd like to see God
[51:51] &gt;&gt; and he was right there,
[51:53] &gt;&gt; but they couldn't recognize him in that
[51:56] form
[51:57] &gt;&gt; because of the veil.
[51:59] Amen.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; You know, such utter humility and such
[52:02] utter uh simplicity.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; They just couldn't grasp that God, the
[52:08] creator of heavens and earth, is
[52:10] standing there in a body,
[52:12] &gt;&gt; eating like they eat and prospiring when
[52:15] it gets hot and get tired when he got
[52:18] when he was weak and and and uh so they
[52:22] just couldn't imagine that.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; He says also there stood a man.
[52:27] They came to see God and they seen a
[52:30] man.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; They couldn't see God because God was
[52:33] veiled to them.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Now keep that on your mind. He said God
[52:38] was veiled in a man.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; And I think we need to keep it in our
[52:43] mind. God. This God that we speak about,
[52:47] the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
[52:50] and the God of Jacob, has determined
[52:53] that a part of himself shall be veiled
[52:56] in a people that are called out in this
[52:58] hour. They will be called the bride of
[53:01] Jesus Christ. But God will be in them.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; That's what he wants to do.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; That's nothing. That's not such a
[53:10] mystery. God wants to do that. That's
[53:13] the purpose of redemption. That's the
[53:16] purpose of of the whole creation.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; And then I'm going to just read, if you
[53:25] want to follow along, you can uh turn
[53:27] into Hebrews the 10th chapter,
[53:31] the next chapter, and also starting at
[53:35] the fifth verse. Now the apostle Paul
[53:38] notice please I'm doing just a little
[53:41] teaching to begin with this the book is
[53:44] to the Hebrews.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; This is not the Romans or the
[53:47] Corinthians or the Ephesians. This is to
[53:50] the Hebrews.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; So Paul goes into details in the Hebrews
[53:55] concerning things that they know and
[53:57] have been taught about since childhood.
[54:00] So he goes in the ninth chapter, he goes
[54:02] in the 10th chapter, and he's referring
[54:05] back and relating back to the tabernacle
[54:08] and to Moses and to the law because they
[54:11] know it well.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; So he's telling them and seeking to
[54:15] advance it and move it forward in their
[54:18] thinking so they can see that Jesus
[54:20] Christ was the fulfillment of so many of
[54:22] these things. So he said, "Wherefore
[54:26] when he cometh into the world, he saith,
[54:28] sacrifice an offering, thou wouldst not,
[54:30] but a body hast thou prepared me
[54:34] &gt;&gt; in offerings and sacrifices?" I'm sorry.
[54:37] Uh that is that's the reading we had. I
[54:39] I I want to go back now to the to the
[54:41] ninth chapter.
[54:44] Ninth chapter in the first verse.
[54:48] Then verily the first covenant. Now he's
[54:51] speaking of the tabernacle. The first
[54:54] covenant had also ordinances of divine
[54:58] service and a worldly sanctuary. For
[55:01] there was a tabernacle made, the first
[55:04] wherein was the candlestick. Now he's
[55:06] talking about the outer court and the
[55:08] table and the showbread which is called
[55:11] the sanctuary.
[55:13] And after the second veil, the
[55:15] tabernacle, which is called the holiest
[55:17] of all, which had the golden sensor, and
[55:21] the ark of the covenant overlaid around
[55:23] with gold, wherein was the golden pot
[55:27] that had mana, and Aaron's rod that
[55:29] budded, and the tables of the covenant.
[55:32] So that's what was essentially in there,
[55:34] those three items. and over it the
[55:37] cherubams of glory overshadowing the
[55:40] mercy seat of which we cannot now speak
[55:44] particularly.
[55:46] Now when these things were thus ordained
[55:49] the priests went the priests went always
[55:53] into the first tabernacle accomplishing
[55:56] the service of God. Are you with me?
[55:59] &gt;&gt; They went into the first tabernacle.
[56:02] That's where the congregation went. The
[56:04] priest went into the first tabernacle
[56:07] uh accomplishing the service of God. But
[56:10] into the second went the high priest
[56:12] alone once every year
[56:16] &gt;&gt; not without blood which he offered for
[56:19] himself and for the errors of the
[56:23] people.
[56:24] The Holy Ghost, thus signifying, the
[56:27] Holy Ghost was signifying
[56:30] that the way into the holiest of all,
[56:32] was not yet made manifest,
[56:35] while as the first tabernacle was yet
[56:38] standing because it was in washings and
[56:42] in sacrifice of animals and blood of
[56:44] animals and so on. So the the holiest of
[56:48] all which was which we will come to now
[56:51] in Paul's writings
[56:54] which was a figure for the time then
[56:56] present in which were offered both gifts
[57:00] and sacrifices that could not make him
[57:03] that did the service perfect as
[57:06] pertaining to the conscience. So man, if
[57:10] you and I were standing back there in
[57:12] that court in the outer court and the
[57:15] high priest was going into the Holy of
[57:17] Holies, which you were not allowed to
[57:19] look into, it was secret. In other
[57:22] words, it was a mystery.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; And and the high priest would go in and
[57:26] he could only tell them what was going
[57:28] what what was happening in there. But he
[57:31] was going in to get to get make
[57:33] sacrifice for the people that their sins
[57:36] would be covered. not removed but just
[57:38] covered. And and it was a figure for the
[57:41] time then present uh which were verse 9
[57:46] which were offered both gifts and
[57:48] sacrifices that could not make uh not
[57:52] make him that did the service perfect as
[57:54] pertaining to the conscience
[57:57] which stood only in meats and drinks and
[57:59] divers washings and cornal ordinances
[58:02] imposed on them until the time of
[58:06] reformation. But Christ being come and
[58:09] high priest of good things to come by a
[58:12] greater and more perfect tabernacle, not
[58:16] made with hands, that is to say, not of
[58:18] this building, neither the blood of
[58:21] goats and calves, but by his own blood.
[58:25] He entered in once into the holy place,
[58:29] having obtained, not trying to obtain,
[58:32] he had obtained eternal redemption for
[58:36] us. Amen.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Can the people say
[58:39] &gt;&gt; amen?
[58:40] &gt;&gt; He has re He's obtained eternal
[58:43] redemption for us.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; We have it.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; He obtained it.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; He didn't obtain it and hold it. He
[58:51] obtained it and gave it.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me hath eternal
[58:56] life,
[58:59] &gt;&gt; having obtained eternal redemption for
[59:02] us. So now
[59:05] I want to take and speak of the two
[59:07] sides of this veil.
[59:11] The veil of the temple. The veil.
[59:14] And while we are speaking of this
[59:15] because there are layers of it.
[59:19] If you catch please these next four
[59:23] items.
[59:24] We speak of the veil of the temple,
[59:29] the veil of the body of the Lord Jesus
[59:31] Christ,
[59:34] the inner veil within each one of us
[59:38] that is between the human spirit and the
[59:42] soul.
[59:44] and the veil between
[59:47] the learned word
[59:50] of religion or denomination or
[59:52] traditions
[59:54] and the revealed vindicated word.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; So I want to see if I have time to
[1:00:01] address those. On the one side,
[1:00:07] on the one side of the veil,
[1:00:12] we have the people
[1:00:15] with their priests, with their
[1:00:18] ministers,
[1:00:20] with all of their sins,
[1:00:22] all of their mistakes,
[1:00:25] all of their weaknesses,
[1:00:28] all of their human weaknesses and
[1:00:30] frailties,
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; all of their debates and discussions
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; and they were just like us.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; And that's on one side of the veil.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; And I'd like you to notice that everyone
[1:00:44] that stood there, there was the good and
[1:00:46] the bad and the indifferent.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Those really desiring, those were very
[1:00:52] good people. There were bad people also
[1:00:55] on that side in the outer court. I'll
[1:00:58] I'll prove it to you in a few moments.
[1:01:01] And there were those that were
[1:01:02] indifferent.
[1:01:04] You know, they didn't really care. Is it
[1:01:06] all that important? I don't know what's
[1:01:08] behind that veil. And is it really
[1:01:10] important to us? On this side of the
[1:01:13] veil, on the outer side was Joshua,
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Caleb,
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; the Levites,
[1:01:23] Miriam, Moses sister,
[1:01:28] Aaron's four sons.
[1:01:31] They were there
[1:01:34] dressed in their coats and their special
[1:01:36] sashes
[1:01:38] called girdles
[1:01:40] and and and their bonnets or the special
[1:01:43] headdress. Very elaborate.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; They were there. They were there right
[1:01:47] beside Kora
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; and Dayathan
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; and Aubri.
[1:01:54] Kora happened to be Moses' cousin,
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; And Dayan and Aubra, they were chiefs of
[1:02:05] uh of the Reubenites.
[1:02:08] These were important guys
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; and they were all there.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; There was a whole assembly of there.
[1:02:18] And the scripture tells us, "And of the
[1:02:20] office of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the
[1:02:23] priest, pertainth the oil for the light,
[1:02:26] and the sweet incense." I'm just putting
[1:02:29] some emphasis. These people weren't just
[1:02:31] average people,
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; And the sweet incense and the daily meat
[1:02:35] offering and the anointing oil and the
[1:02:38] oversight of all the tabernacle. That
[1:02:41] was Eleazar. But he was standing out
[1:02:42] there also.
[1:02:46] He's standing there with and all that
[1:02:48] crown there.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; There's those that are going to die in
[1:02:51] the wilderness and there's children
[1:02:52] there are going to go into their
[1:02:54] inheritance.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; They're all there.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; The sons of Aaron, the priests that blew
[1:03:02] the trumpets, they were the sons of
[1:03:04] Aaron. They're there.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; The sons of Aaron sh that offer
[1:03:09] sacrifices, they're there.
[1:03:12] And yet all of these stood on the one
[1:03:14] side of the veil. Brother Brandham said
[1:03:17] in the Revelation series,
[1:03:20] that's the flesh, the outer court
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; is the flesh.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; He said that's the things that we can't
[1:03:27] depend on.
[1:03:31] And we have that because I said I was
[1:03:34] going to speak on four on that temple
[1:03:35] back there on the veil of Jesus Christ
[1:03:39] on the veil of our human flesh between
[1:03:41] the between the the spirit and the soul.
[1:03:45] And you have a human spirit
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; and it has all the attributes that God
[1:03:51] speaks of and that the prophet of God
[1:03:52] actually detailed very very clearly. We
[1:03:56] have all of that. And if and if you were
[1:03:58] here and brother Brandham was here and
[1:04:00] you were before him with some uh in need
[1:04:02] or something that was the most important
[1:04:04] thing in your life right at that moment
[1:04:06] whether it was a loved one that was sick
[1:04:08] and dying, a wife, a husband or whether
[1:04:10] you were there with some kind of illness
[1:04:12] or something that had plagued you for so
[1:04:13] many years and you were there or you
[1:04:15] were there in needing of the baptism of
[1:04:18] the Holy Ghost or or you were there
[1:04:20] because you weren't a a a Christian,
[1:04:22] you'd be standing there and and and he
[1:04:25] might speak to you for a few moments
[1:04:26] until He would say, "I'm trying to
[1:04:28] contact your spirit."
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; And in contacting your spirit, he would
[1:04:34] do exactly as he did to the woman at the
[1:04:36] well where she had five husbands and the
[1:04:38] one that she was with now was not her
[1:04:40] husband.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; And that was all standing on the on the
[1:04:46] other side in the outer courts. But and
[1:04:50] we all have that the things of the
[1:04:52] flesh. That's the flesh. the outer
[1:04:54] courts. That's the things you can't
[1:04:56] depend on because it's flesh
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; and the flesh is weak.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; In the inner veil message, brother
[1:05:05] Brennham, he gives further description.
[1:05:08] And that's why when you read the
[1:05:10] innerval message and while you study it,
[1:05:13] keep it in this context if you would
[1:05:15] because he keeps detailing those things
[1:05:18] in modern language in our language today
[1:05:21] of the things that uh identify the outer
[1:05:25] court or this side of the veil. And he
[1:05:29] said uh
[1:05:33] they're tossed about. This crowd here
[1:05:36] that's on this side, they're tossed
[1:05:38] about,
[1:05:40] they have ups and downs.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; I have to put up both hands.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; I have ups and downs.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; He said they have deep desire. These
[1:05:53] people have a deep desire.
[1:05:56] those that are even tossed about. He
[1:05:58] says, "And they're seeking God,
[1:06:01] but they never really come to a
[1:06:03] settlement is his words." Never really
[1:06:06] come to a settlement. I want to say this
[1:06:09] congregation and all that are listening
[1:06:11] on the internet, that is this generation
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; and that's why the prophet of God
[1:06:17] brought this to us.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; And we don't want to stay where we have
[1:06:22] been, friends. Amen.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; And those of you that may be up in the
[1:06:27] balcony or in the back or in the in the
[1:06:29] cry room or in the nursery,
[1:06:33] uh I'm speaking directly to us all. We
[1:06:37] want to have a a a a greater and a
[1:06:39] higher level of commitment
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; than we have had in the past.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; We want to move to a different level
[1:06:47] than we've lived before. Amen.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; So they have a deep desire but they have
[1:06:55] no they never seem to come to a
[1:06:57] settlement. There's no anchor he said in
[1:07:00] Christ. There's in other words they
[1:07:02] haven't anchored themselves in the word.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Said they have a mental conception
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; by knowledge of what God is is
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; and they're like the priest which I'll
[1:07:16] describe later on. Brother Brown
[1:07:18] describes the priest compares her him
[1:07:21] with the woman at the well. He says uh
[1:07:23] she come up with a different conclusion
[1:07:25] than he did because he learned
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; that God was God and he learned that
[1:07:30] this way was right.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; We have learned many people in the
[1:07:35] message have learned the message is the
[1:07:37] truth.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take it doesn't take a
[1:07:40] Philadelphia lawyer to understand that
[1:07:42] the message is a million miles from
[1:07:44] everything else out there. That's great.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take any smart person to
[1:07:49] listen to a tape and have a prophet of
[1:07:51] God reveal the secret of the heart and
[1:07:53] say this to this person that to the
[1:07:54] other person and see see the
[1:07:56] supernatural take place. It doesn't take
[1:07:58] a brilliant man or woman to say that's
[1:08:01] different.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; It doesn't even take a lot of
[1:08:04] intelligence when you hear the serpent
[1:08:06] seed explained from Genesis through to
[1:08:08] Revelation to say that's plain as can
[1:08:11] be.
[1:08:13] Do you believe that or do you believe an
[1:08:15] apple?
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; What do you think we are?
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; It only makes sense. I had a whole group
[1:08:21] of university from University of British
[1:08:22] Columbia in my front room and I went
[1:08:24] through the serpent seat with him. One
[1:08:26] one one young man, he's in his 20s. He's
[1:08:29] so transfixed. He just kept sliding
[1:08:31] down, sliding down. Pretty soon he slid
[1:08:32] right off the sofa and was on the floor.
[1:08:35] He just totally transfixed. We had some
[1:08:37] young men from a Pentecostal church over
[1:08:40] in New Westminster. And when we went,
[1:08:42] two or three of them went through the
[1:08:44] serpent seed with them because it is so
[1:08:46] ironclad in the scripture, it's
[1:08:48] absolutely unmovable. And by the time I
[1:08:51] was finished and clenched every nail,
[1:08:53] they said, "Oh, we're going to go to our
[1:08:55] pastor. He'll see this." I said, "Don't
[1:08:58] do it.
[1:09:00] God's dealing with you."
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, they said, "Anybody can see this."
[1:09:05] They walked out and we never saw them
[1:09:07] again.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; What was it? There's other, you know,
[1:09:10] smart intellectuals that take the seed
[1:09:12] and take it away.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what Jesus said. They'll
[1:09:16] take the seed and take it away. If God
[1:09:18] speaks to you, it's for you.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; It's not for the whole family. It may
[1:09:24] not be for the whole country. May not be
[1:09:26] for all your friends, but it is for you.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; And there is a group of people that
[1:09:33] God's determined not to leave in the
[1:09:35] outer court.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; You may feel the effects of the outer
[1:09:39] court, but God's not going to leave his
[1:09:41] children in the outer court.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; He paid the price.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To tear that veil in two
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; and take us into the holy of holies.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Said they have a mental conception. He
[1:09:59] said even those that are in the outer
[1:10:01] court, he said they're feasting on the
[1:10:03] mana.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't hold out.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; He even likened it to maybe, you know,
[1:10:10] they come to a revival meeting and oh,
[1:10:12] they're just, you know, dancing in the
[1:10:14] spirit and shouting, have all kinds of
[1:10:17] uh things happening, but then the next
[1:10:19] day, even the next week, it's all gone.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; The mana, the mana that they eat, it it
[1:10:26] just it vanishes. And that's what the
[1:10:28] mana was like almost like a horrost.
[1:10:30] They picked it up and it would only last
[1:10:32] while they were picking it up and and in
[1:10:34] a in an hour or two it was gone.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; And so the feasting they feast and they
[1:10:44] they want to feast on the word but the
[1:10:47] feast brother Brandham uses the
[1:10:48] terminology it doesn't hold out.
[1:10:52] I want to I want to bring something to
[1:10:54] your attention here which has bothered
[1:10:56] me for a lot of years and I'm just
[1:10:59] dropping these things and I hope that
[1:11:01] you will put that in your script bag and
[1:11:03] remember it. There are preachers there
[1:11:06] are preachers or uh people who have
[1:11:10] specialty doctrines, special revelations
[1:11:13] and they're also in the outer court
[1:11:15] because the whole congregation's there.
[1:11:17] Everybody's there.
[1:11:19] Like I said, the good, bad, the
[1:11:20] indifferent, and the opportunists are
[1:11:22] there,
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; and you'll run into somebody, all of you
[1:11:25] will along the way. And and and they'll
[1:11:28] sense that you are one of those that's
[1:11:31] maybe just a little a little sense of
[1:11:33] insecurity. Well, you know, I really
[1:11:35] don't know where I stand. It's ah,
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; have I got a message for you?
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; You need this specialty doctor. Right.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; And we've had them even in the message
[1:11:48] and they come amongst a congregation and
[1:11:50] they start and and because they have a
[1:11:52] certain human uh ability, they're
[1:11:56] they're they're strong personalities and
[1:11:59] they come up and say, "Do you have the
[1:12:01] Holy Ghost?" And if you even hesitate to
[1:12:05] say, "Ah, see, you're not sure." And the
[1:12:08] prophet said this and the prophet said
[1:12:10] that. If you have it, you know that you
[1:12:12] have it and you haven't got it. You need
[1:12:14] this.
[1:12:15] and they're ready to slide in their
[1:12:17] doctrine.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; We've had all kinds of doctrines that
[1:12:24] have been resident within the message.
[1:12:29] And don't think that I'm out of place by
[1:12:32] even mentioning them.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Some say, "Oh, well, you have to believe
[1:12:38] that brother Brandham's going to return
[1:12:40] and that he's going to do all of these
[1:12:42] things." And if you don't believe that
[1:12:44] exactly the way we believe it or the way
[1:12:46] I believe it, you're not in. But if you
[1:12:48] really want to get in, you want to
[1:12:50] believe this the way I believe it. Well,
[1:12:53] I want to believe it the way Brother
[1:12:54] Brandham said it.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; And others say, "Well, and we I even had
[1:13:00] it. We had it right here in the church."
[1:13:02] And and and some would come in traveling
[1:13:04] in and they'd say, you know, they always
[1:13:06] start out with that. Do you have the
[1:13:07] Holy Ghost? And if you hesitate, they
[1:13:10] say, "What you need is a revelation of
[1:13:12] the seven thunders." Right?
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Like that was the answer. You see, all
[1:13:17] we did was move up from a little bit ago
[1:13:20] because and brother Brandon deals with
[1:13:22] that when you read, please read in the
[1:13:24] in the inner veil. He'll say there's
[1:13:27] group of people and he says, "Oh, what
[1:13:29] you need you need to you need to speak
[1:13:31] in tongues."
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; That's still around.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Or others, they were so quiet. You need
[1:13:38] to shout. You need to get liberated. You
[1:13:41] need to You need to have the spirit of
[1:13:43] praise on you and that'll solve
[1:13:45] everything. But Brother Bram said, "I
[1:13:47] heard them shout
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; and they didn't have it.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; I heard them speak in tongues and they
[1:13:53] didn't have it."
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; In other words, I heard them speak in
[1:13:55] tongues. I heard them shout, but they
[1:13:57] weren't on the other side of the veil.
[1:13:58] They were still on this side.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; I heard them do all these things where
[1:14:02] they promised and said, "Ah, this is it.
[1:14:04] If you do this,
[1:14:07] Yeah.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; And I've been there and they've tooken
[1:14:09] them and shake them and and someone say,
[1:14:11] "Say this, say this, say this." Trying
[1:14:13] to get you. And if you just said a word
[1:14:15] or two, oh, they were just so thrilled.
[1:14:17] You have it.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; But you walked out and you know you
[1:14:20] didn't have it.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; And if somebody could just prove that
[1:14:28] you had two souls,
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; I say that's still on the other side of
[1:14:35] the veil.
[1:14:37] All those special doctrines are still on
[1:14:39] other side of the veil.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; But once you once you pierce through
[1:14:46] [Music]
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; and get on the other side of the veil,
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; and I'll tell you friends, there's no
[1:14:53] excuse for us not to have the benefits
[1:14:56] of the inner veil. There's no excuse for
[1:14:59] us not to have the full benefits
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; of the Holy of Holies
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; because that has been purchased for us.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; So preachers have taken advantage
[1:15:12] perhaps of the of the insecurity that of
[1:15:16] some that some may feel that they have.
[1:15:19] Listen, it's it's not a it's not a sin
[1:15:22] or a crime to feel that we, you know, I
[1:15:26] don't really know or uh we we get to a
[1:15:29] place where things we're going through a
[1:15:31] difficult time and we don't really know
[1:15:33] where we stand, but hold steady.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Just hold steady.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go out and and approve
[1:15:41] anything.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; He's the one that's going to approve.
[1:15:44] Just hold steady. Even if you just get
[1:15:47] to a place where say all I know
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; is I love this word.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; That's all I know. I do know I love this
[1:15:54] word.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; I've gotten to the place at times in my
[1:15:58] life where I've said I know one thing.
[1:16:01] This world is not my home.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not comfortable with this world.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; I have no desire for the way that they
[1:16:10] go. I have no desire for their
[1:16:12] entertainment. have no desire for the
[1:16:15] things that occupy them.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; I have no desire for their religion,
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; but I do know there is a presence.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; I know there's a real person
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; called Jesus Christ.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; I've tasted of the good word of God.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; And you hold steadfast on that, I tell
[1:16:34] you, he'll come through.
[1:16:42] This is a different message
[1:16:45] but like to think this whole crowd that
[1:16:48] I described. I put us all there
[1:16:53] and I thought
[1:16:55] so close
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; and yet so far.
[1:17:00] There they are with all of this whole
[1:17:03] shamzle and mixture of everything and
[1:17:07] the curtains right here. Or maybe we're
[1:17:09] just looking at it just up there.
[1:17:15] So close.
[1:17:17] And the high priest, he's just the other
[1:17:20] side. And I can imagine
[1:17:23] he's got the basin because I saw him go
[1:17:24] in with the basin. He's got blood.
[1:17:30] And I can hear the
[1:17:32] bells because around his garment was
[1:17:36] pomegranates and a bell. Pomegranate and
[1:17:39] a bell. They could hear the bell. He was
[1:17:42] walking because if he was accepted,
[1:17:46] we were accepted.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; And if he was rejected, he was slain.
[1:17:56] And they had a rope tied to him and they
[1:17:58] drag him up because no one else could go
[1:18:00] there.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; So they'd listen. Yeah. The bells are
[1:18:03] still tinkling. Yeah. Yeah. And he's
[1:18:07] making his way out.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, he came out and we're accepted.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; So somehow God has acknowledged us and
[1:18:21] we're accepted.
[1:18:26] But into the second went the high priest
[1:18:28] alone,
[1:18:30] alone
[1:18:32] once every year,
[1:18:34] not without blood, which he offered for
[1:18:37] himself, cuz he also was like those on
[1:18:39] the outside
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; and for the errors of the people.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; So when that high priest died, there had
[1:18:47] to be another one raised up
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; because he had to keep going in. It had
[1:18:51] to happen every year
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; and one would die and it was there there
[1:18:55] was another priest that would enter.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; But then one came along.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; It was that Melzdc that met Abraham.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; And we heard of him in the Old
[1:19:09] Testament. But then that Melzdc the
[1:19:11] prophet said became Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; So on the other side,
[1:19:23] we're talking now about the inside. Can
[1:19:25] I describe it for you for a few minutes?
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; On the other side,
[1:19:31] it was so close and yet so far.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; But just on the other side was the total
[1:19:38] answer.
[1:19:40] For all the problems that existed out
[1:19:42] here, the answer was just the other side
[1:19:45] of the curtain.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Your problem, my problem, her problem,
[1:19:51] your problem, their problem, this
[1:19:54] family's problem, all the answers
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; that you might even have today. All the
[1:19:59] answer laid just the other side.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. Either this thing
[1:20:05] is true or it's not true.
[1:20:07] The answer for every person, for every
[1:20:10] family, for every home,
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; for every nation. The answer laid just
[1:20:15] the other side of the curtain.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; The complete answer.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; A holy God.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; All the holiness of God, the pillar of
[1:20:28] fire over the tabernacle, the mercy
[1:20:31] seat. Who doesn't need the mercy seat?
[1:20:34] It was just the other side. So close,
[1:20:35] but it was there.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Here's what brother Brandon said is on
[1:20:46] the other side.
[1:20:47] Over here are aliens,
[1:20:50] foreigners, and strangers
[1:20:53] to the kingdom of God. But just the
[1:20:56] other side of the curtain is sons and
[1:21:00] daughters and the aliens no more.
[1:21:05] When once you become a son and daughter
[1:21:07] of God, you'll never be an alien again.
[1:21:12] [Music]
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Whoso eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my
[1:21:19] blood hath eternal life.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; And I will raise him up at the last day.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; I was I smiled and yet it was it was
[1:21:30] kind of strange. Uh, brother John and
[1:21:33] sister Leah's
[1:21:35] young one Isabelle,
[1:21:38] she was praying
[1:21:42] and uh
[1:21:45] I don't know where she is just now, but
[1:21:46] she's different
[1:21:50] and I see the little smile on some of
[1:21:52] your faces. You you've run into her
[1:21:56] and she's in she she's getting into
[1:21:59] serious things in her prayers.
[1:22:01] And she's praying,
[1:22:03] Jesus,
[1:22:06] how how do how,
[1:22:08] you know, I want to drink your blood.
[1:22:11] How do I drink your blood?
[1:22:15] And show me how to drink your blood. I
[1:22:18] don't know how to drink your blood.
[1:22:21] I thought, what simplicity?
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; And you think a little one like that
[1:22:26] never hear such a thing.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; That that never entered their mind.
[1:22:31] But it is incredible.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; There are things that we don't know what
[1:22:34] to do or how to do. We read it, but we
[1:22:37] don't know exactly how to do it.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; That's what we need. We need that kind
[1:22:40] of simplicity. I don't know exactly how.
[1:22:43] And there's people who are adult that
[1:22:44] don't know how to drink his blood.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Very true.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; I was thinking today about the about the
[1:22:53] humility and about the spirit of
[1:22:56] reconciliation and about the things of
[1:23:00] that are so clear in the scripture and
[1:23:02] so clear in the message. I think I read
[1:23:05] it
[1:23:07] uh not able to really obtain it.
[1:23:12] But show me how.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; How do we do it? Amen.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Have you ever had an upset in your home
[1:23:17] and you need to say, "Forgive me,"
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; but you really didn't know just exactly
[1:23:22] how to say it.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Now you're also nice and quiet. I know
[1:23:28] you've never been there.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Well, that's fine.
[1:23:32] I know you've been there.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; I said something. Now, how do I retract
[1:23:39] it? It's almost impossible. It's already
[1:23:42] gone out.
[1:23:44] How do I change it? How do I rectify
[1:23:46] this?
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; We know what we should do, but we don't
[1:23:52] know how exactly to do it.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; So now he says,
[1:23:59] having therefore, brethren, boldness,
[1:24:02] and that happens to be the text to the
[1:24:04] message,
[1:24:06] uh, intervail.
[1:24:08] Having therefore boldness, brethren,
[1:24:11] boldness to enter into the holiest by
[1:24:14] the blood of Jesus Christ. All right,
[1:24:16] there it is. How
[1:24:19] do we affect that? How do we do that?
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; it's written right there. And if it's
[1:24:25] written right here, it must be for the
[1:24:27] people of God.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; And you might say, I'm not an alien. I
[1:24:30] am I am uh uh but but yet I have so many
[1:24:33] of these other things of these
[1:24:35] confusions and these the different
[1:24:37] things that happened there. How do I
[1:24:39] enter into that place? And then when
[1:24:41] brother Brandham when you get into the
[1:24:43] inner veil,
[1:24:52] he says talking about the other side,
[1:24:59] did you ever meet a person
[1:25:04] that's been in there
[1:25:10] and has tasted
[1:25:13] and is living on this mana.
[1:25:16] That's the mana that's on the inside.
[1:25:17] Not the mana outside, the mana that's on
[1:25:19] the inside.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; You can meet him on Monday,
[1:25:25] Tuesday,
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
[1:25:30] Saturday or Sunday.
[1:25:33] Cloudy,
[1:25:35] cloudy day, bright day,
[1:25:38] gloomy day,
[1:25:41] things going right or things going
[1:25:43] wrong.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Do you have things going wrong?
[1:25:49] But if you meet a person that's been in
[1:25:51] there,
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; somehow
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; the atmosphere
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; from in there
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; invalidates the atmosphere outside of
[1:26:04] there.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; And we can say, well, it's a nice
[1:26:09] sermon, but I'm saying this is a
[1:26:10] reality.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Either this belongs to us or don't
[1:26:13] belong to us.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; If it doesn't belong to us, we should
[1:26:16] shut the doors and go home.
[1:26:19] It belongs to us.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; And the devil would like to get us to
[1:26:23] believe, well, that's just, you know, an
[1:26:25] intermediate feeling because he's an
[1:26:27] expert outside,
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; but I can tell you he's never been
[1:26:30] inside there.
[1:26:32] [Music]
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery to him.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; He hasn't been in the holiest of holies,
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; but you are invited into it.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; You have been in there. You've tasted of
[1:26:45] it.
[1:26:46] [Music]
[1:26:50] Amen.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think that we've been at the
[1:26:54] curtain and we bit in and we tasted of
[1:26:59] it and we got the atmosphere of it and
[1:27:00] we thought, "Oh, this will last
[1:27:02] forever." And then something happens
[1:27:04] say, "Oh, I think I heard something out
[1:27:05] here and get out here and hear a little
[1:27:07] bit of gossip."
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Or we get feeling some kind of stirred
[1:27:13] up within ourselves.
[1:27:15] friends, what we're doing, we're peeking
[1:27:17] on the other side.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Things are going right or wrong,
[1:27:27] he's always sweet.
[1:27:37] When I read that, I have plenty of
[1:27:39] trouble
[1:27:43] because just all too often I'm not
[1:27:46] always sweet.
[1:27:49] And yet I read that and this is absolute
[1:27:52] truth
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; and that is my confession
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; that is not there like it's some pie in
[1:27:59] the sky available to me. It's right
[1:28:02] here.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Always full of love.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Never to talk or do anything wrong.
[1:28:18] He's living under the glory of God.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Listen folks, I'm not preaching to you.
[1:28:28] I'm preaching for us.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; I'm part of this.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; He never gets hungry.
[1:28:36] He never has to go to church to get
[1:28:38] built up.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; He's just always full of God.
[1:28:46] Hallelujah.
[1:29:15] Inside there
[1:29:18] is the two tables of stone with the
[1:29:20] commandments written which no man could
[1:29:23] keep the mercy seat a shakina presence
[1:29:26] of the Almighty.
[1:29:30] And here's here's here's how brother
[1:29:32] Vanom describes it inside.
[1:29:37] You ceased to be an alien.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Now you are a child. You know, friends,
[1:29:44] I know that's taken place. I know that
[1:29:47] we're not aliens and strangers to the
[1:29:49] kingdom of God. I know that we are
[1:29:51] children.
[1:29:53] But then we should we should drive our
[1:29:56] stakes down. We should make the
[1:29:58] announcement. We should let the enemy
[1:30:00] know that we're making a declaration.
[1:30:04] This is my home,
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; not here. Amen.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; This is what I will live in.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; And this is what I'll deny.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; He says, "You're not an alien." Can you
[1:30:16] say, "Amen."
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Say, "I'm not an alien.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; I'm not an alien.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; I'm a child
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; of God." Hallelujah.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; You need to be able to be, you know,
[1:30:28] bold enough to declare that. And then he
[1:30:31] goes, and here's where I see the veil.
[1:30:34] From death to life.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; From darkness
[1:30:40] to day.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Roy.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; From mortal to immortality.
[1:30:46] [Music]
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; From corruption to incorruption.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; From weary to joy.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; From death to life. Amen.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Hello, folks.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Which side of the veil?
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; This is not just a church service. This
[1:31:04] isn't a Sunday service. It's for you to
[1:31:06] make a declaration on which side of this
[1:31:09] veil you are.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; I am not here in confusion. I am in I'm
[1:31:15] in I'm in uh absolute peace.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; My peace give I unto you. Not as the
[1:31:22] world giveth.
[1:31:23] I give you my peace.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; That's our high priest. He's gone in
[1:31:28] there.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Is that your portion?
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; You want to say with me? I'm I want to
[1:31:34] get this right down. I'm not an alien.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not living in that weary state.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; I refuse it.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; And even Satan tries to impose it upon
[1:31:49] you. Why? Because you have you possess
[1:31:53] you're walking with both sides of the
[1:31:56] veil.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; You have a flesh as well. But God has
[1:32:02] ordained that that flesh should veil
[1:32:04] God.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Not upon feelings.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Now he's referring to the other side.
[1:32:18] Not upon emotions.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:32:21] Not upon theory,
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; not upon some unknown something that
[1:32:26] somebody has said to you that has no
[1:32:29] basis.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Upon someone say, "Well, you come and
[1:32:33] join our church and it'll be finished."
[1:32:36] And upon the word of God, uh, but upon
[1:32:39] the word of God, the human soul rests
[1:32:42] solid, God said. And that settles it and
[1:32:45] makes it real. Amen.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; So geographically it's like saying well
[1:32:52] if I if I move from this place if I move
[1:32:54] from this seat to this seat over here
[1:32:56] it'll be changed. That that's not it. It
[1:32:58] is something that has happened within.
[1:33:01] And when it's happened within, you'll
[1:33:02] have it wherever you are and wherever
[1:33:04] you go.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament,
[1:33:16] the word of God and access to the word
[1:33:20] was sealed and shrouded in mystery. I
[1:33:23] want to follow you. Follow me very very
[1:33:25] close. Don't be don't presume you know
[1:33:28] where I'm going.
[1:33:31] So in the Old Testament
[1:33:34] in that veil
[1:33:36] the word of God which was the two
[1:33:38] tablets which were inside which they
[1:33:40] couldn't keep to begin with
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; even if they saw them and were able to
[1:33:45] read them. They couldn't keep it.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; In fact is they would only condemn them.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; How would you like to read the Bible
[1:33:52] every day and just be condemned
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; and condemned? They they would read the
[1:33:56] Old Testament. They were condemned.
[1:33:59] That's right.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; So the access to the word was sealed and
[1:34:11] shrouded in mystery. And in the New
[1:34:14] Testament,
[1:34:16] the word of God in Christ
[1:34:19] was so close yet it was sealed in
[1:34:23] shrouded in mystery. It was so close.
[1:34:28] The
[1:34:31] I have I have quite a bit to say, so
[1:34:33] listen close.
[1:34:37] Many times we read the Bible, we think,
[1:34:39] "Oh, if I'd only been back then." No, if
[1:34:41] you'd been back then, it might have been
[1:34:42] even harder than it is right now.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, I would have just loved him."
[1:34:48] I doubt it. Unless it be the grace of
[1:34:51] God upon you
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; because you'd be looking if you dare
[1:34:55] look at the outside now. If you're
[1:34:56] caught with emotions right now or if
[1:34:58] you're caught in that other realm the
[1:35:00] the outer side of the veil you you are
[1:35:03] on the other side of the veil.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; He was the veil.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; His body was the veil.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; And the people were on the outside
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to come quickly because
[1:35:14] I've got to move along. And so Jesus
[1:35:16] walked. He he he he he saw people along
[1:35:19] the way and the and the Greeks said we
[1:35:22] would see Jesus
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; and Jesus said except a corner of wheat
[1:35:28] fall in the ground it abides alone and
[1:35:30] so on. So he just added mystery to
[1:35:33] mystery.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; But then Jesus in his humanity
[1:35:40] he comes to a well and he's wearied.
[1:35:43] He's weary.
[1:35:47] Hello, church members. Cloverdale Bible
[1:35:49] Way.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't portray to me that you'd
[1:35:53] have been there and you'd have had
[1:35:54] something great. You'd have been beyond
[1:35:56] the disciples and the and the apostles
[1:35:59] and you'd have figured it all out. No,
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; you wouldn't figure this one out,
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Because we spend too much time on the
[1:36:05] other side of the veil.
[1:36:08] And so he he he was wearied and he sat
[1:36:10] down on the well and a woman comes to
[1:36:12] get water.
[1:36:17] Now he wasn't just a man, but he was
[1:36:20] God.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Woman,
[1:36:25] give me a drink.
[1:36:30] He says, "How is it that you being a
[1:36:32] Samaritan ask of me a drink?" the Jews,
[1:36:36] they don't have it. We don't have any
[1:36:38] dealings. We got segregation.
[1:36:41] He said, "If you knew who it was that
[1:36:43] was talking to you, you'd ask me for a
[1:36:46] drink,
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; and I'd give you water. You'd neither
[1:36:49] come here to draw, and you wouldn't be
[1:36:51] thirsty again."
[1:36:53] Says, "Are you greater than Jacob who
[1:36:56] gave us this well,
[1:36:58] and you have nothing to draw with?"
[1:37:03] And he and that's when he said if you
[1:37:04] knew who it was
[1:37:07] and she said he made her thirsty said
[1:37:11] give me to drink give me this water
[1:37:17] and now he reaches to the realm of her
[1:37:19] emotional realm go and get your husband
[1:37:24] said I don't have a husband
[1:37:28] Jesus said you answered the truth
[1:37:32] You've had five and the one you have now
[1:37:35] is not your husband.
[1:37:40] What's he doing?
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; He's bringing her closer to the veil.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; He's bringing her closer closer
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; because now she sees that there's
[1:37:51] something beyond what I'm looking at
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; that. What is this that knows me? Amen.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Who is this that knows me?
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; And now her mind isn't on the water. Now
[1:38:05] she says, uh,
[1:38:08] the Jews say we should worship in this
[1:38:11] city of Jerusalem and the Samaritans say
[1:38:13] we should be on this mountain and she
[1:38:15] becomes religious. And that's always the
[1:38:17] case when you're talking to people and
[1:38:19] they start getting close, they become
[1:38:20] religious. Amen.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Said where should we worship
[1:38:29] and then Jesus is really tester. He says
[1:38:32] you Samaritans you worship you don't
[1:38:34] know what
[1:38:37] salvation's of the Jews.
[1:38:41] Hello
[1:38:43] Bible way. In this sad
[1:38:47] Leodysian age, I would hate to think,
[1:38:51] but there may have been people here in
[1:38:53] this audience that may have said,
[1:38:55] "That's enough for me. I'm out of here."
[1:38:59] Anybody that's going to run my religion
[1:39:01] down, run me down as a Samaritan. I was
[1:39:05] born a Samaritan. How can I help that?
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; No. There was no such a reaction from
[1:39:11] her. right?
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Said you don't even know,
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham. Thank God for a
[1:39:16] prophet.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the prophet to give us an
[1:39:21] answer.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; He said she knew one thing.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Can anybody tell me what it was? She
[1:39:27] knew one thing. I know when the Messiah
[1:39:31] comes, he'll tell us all things.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; That was the only thing she knew. Yes.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "When she said
[1:39:40] that,
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; I know when the Messiah comes, he'll
[1:39:44] tell us all things." And then that
[1:39:47] opened the door and the Holy Spirit of
[1:39:50] God ripped that ripped that curtain,
[1:39:53] that veil from top to bottom. And he
[1:39:56] said, "I'm heal."
[1:40:02] [Music]
[1:40:04] The veil was tore from top to bottom and
[1:40:08] she looked straight into the holy of
[1:40:10] holies and saw the Messiah
[1:40:14] and it changed her entire life. She left
[1:40:16] her water buck. She left her plan and
[1:40:19] pro what she was going to do that day
[1:40:21] and she ran into the city and became an
[1:40:24] evangelist of a sort said come and see a
[1:40:28] man that told me all that ever I did. Is
[1:40:32] not this the Christ.
[1:40:35] [Music]
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; She never had another day like that one.
[1:40:41] [Music]
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Suddenly church meant nothing.
[1:40:47] Samaritans meant nothing. Jerusalem
[1:40:49] meant nothing. The mountain meant
[1:40:51] nothing. Where and how and all all this
[1:40:54] uh confusion. She left the confusion
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; and came into the settlement of mine.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; She left a place that she had no anchor
[1:41:03] and she became anchored in Christ the
[1:41:05] Messiah.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says they uh he said
[1:41:10] that light struck the seed
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; and pierced even her own flesh.
[1:41:16] [Music]
[1:41:20] We need it, friends.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; We need it.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; This church needs it.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Believers everywhere need it.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; And we need people.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; We need people who have pierced through
[1:41:33] this old carnal flesh.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; And have nothing more to do with just a
[1:41:38] bunch of emotionalism and and all full
[1:41:41] of victory one day and down in the dumps
[1:41:43] the next day. and I'm on fire today and
[1:41:46] now I'm not tomorrow. Forget that life.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; It's not for us.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Once again,
[1:42:04] she wasn't only close and so far, but
[1:42:07] she was close and came in.
[1:42:14] God failed.
[1:42:16] Brother Brandham says about this woman
[1:42:18] in the future home.
[1:42:22] He said this little woman, her first
[1:42:24] life up here, she was a prostitute.
[1:42:27] She was all marred up, but way down in
[1:42:31] here in her
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; was just a little bit of understanding.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; I know when the Messiah cometh, he said
[1:42:40] that was there. Amen.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus came and manifested the
[1:42:43] word, because the word discerned the
[1:42:45] thoughts that was in her heart. Hebrews
[1:42:47] 4:12, the word was a discerner of the
[1:42:50] thoughts of the heart.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; And he came as the son of man, the
[1:42:54] prophet. What happened? The priest with
[1:42:58] only intellectual learning said, "It's a
[1:43:00] devil."
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Because that's what his denomination
[1:43:03] called it.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; What did he do? What did it do? He had
[1:43:08] no representation. So it blacked him
[1:43:11] out. But this little woman,
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; had nothing to present.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; She was as filthy and dirty as she could
[1:43:18] be. But notice way down in her, she's
[1:43:21] got representation.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; And then she was looking for this to be
[1:43:27] made flesh. She had representation. She
[1:43:29] was looking for it. That's why she said,
[1:43:31] "I know when the Messiah cometh, he'll
[1:43:34] tell us all things." And when she went
[1:43:36] into the city, that's exactly what she
[1:43:38] said. Come see a man that told me all
[1:43:41] things.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; He only told her, "You're not with your
[1:43:43] husband."
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; And you've had five. That's all he told
[1:43:47] her. But to her, it unveiled everything.
[1:43:51] [Applause]
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; And when he said that, she said, and she
[1:43:57] said, "You're not Belub. No, I perceive
[1:44:00] that you're a prophet."
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Now we know. Now we know where the
[1:44:03] Messiah which is Christ he will come and
[1:44:07] when he does he will do this
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; and he said I'm he.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; No more doubt.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to explain it.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; She saw it.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; We don't need a lot of explanation.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, as simple as I'm
[1:44:21] preaching this morning, you don't need a
[1:44:23] bunch of teaching on this. All you need
[1:44:25] to do is say, "Brother Biscll, that's
[1:44:27] the truth.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; I believe that." That's right out of the
[1:44:31] word of God.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet of God has said.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; And I believe that's for me.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; You'll find yourself inside.
[1:44:40] [Applause]
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; She believed it
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; and away she went.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; What did it do to her?
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; It redeemed her.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; We must not be those
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; that have merely learned the message.
[1:44:59] Please. Right,
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; friends. I want to spend eternity with
[1:45:02] you. I desire it with all my heart.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; But I find within the message, there's
[1:45:08] too many that have just learned it.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; They've learned that the message is
[1:45:12] true.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; And and he said concerning the priest,
[1:45:16] he said, "And there was a priest
[1:45:18] representing the light." We can say
[1:45:20] we're believers and we represent the
[1:45:22] message.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; But he learned it from the Bible.
[1:45:28] He learned that God was God.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; He learned that holiness was right.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; He learned that there was a law of God.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; And he learned it because of
[1:45:41] intellectual conception. He can
[1:45:43] understand it. He could grasp it. Don't
[1:45:45] learn anything from this message this
[1:45:48] morning. Let the Holy Spirit take the
[1:45:51] truth some just a phrase or a sentence
[1:45:55] and drive it down and anchor your soul
[1:45:58] in it.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Life will be completely different.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; He said he was born of the right
[1:46:04] lineage. Some of you young people,
[1:46:06] you've been born of the right lineage
[1:46:07] because you were born into a certain
[1:46:09] family. You find yourself here in the
[1:46:11] house of God hearing things that
[1:46:13] multitudes of others in other churches
[1:46:15] are not hearing.
[1:46:18] And he was born of the right lineage. He
[1:46:20] was a Levite. But the only he only knew
[1:46:23] it intellectual conception. And when the
[1:46:26] light of the hour,
[1:46:28] he learned it by what had happened.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; He said he had learned it by what had
[1:46:33] happened.
[1:46:36] Not what was happening. Right.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; And when he found what was happening,
[1:46:44] his denomination said nothing about it.
[1:46:47] And that's why he discredited.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says to this woman, I want
[1:46:52] to move along as quickly as I can.
[1:46:53] Please help me.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; He said she could teach a lot of people
[1:46:58] a lot of things.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; He was preaching in Birmingham, Alabama.
[1:47:07] He said in Birmingham, Alabama happens
[1:47:09] to be where
[1:47:12] uh
[1:47:14] Professor Harold, David Edwin Harold,
[1:47:19] that's where he he wrote the book All
[1:47:21] Things Are Possible.
[1:47:24] And he's the one who puts Brother
[1:47:26] Brandham at the front page of his book,
[1:47:29] the first chapter.
[1:47:31] He also flew up here. He heard me use
[1:47:34] his name over the radio many years ago
[1:47:37] and he was going to San Francisco to
[1:47:40] speak and he flew up here and we spent a
[1:47:43] day with him. Brother Lonnie Jenkins was
[1:47:45] here at the time we spent a day with and
[1:47:48] he was in Birmingham.
[1:47:50] I don't know he may well have been there
[1:47:52] in 1964 when brother Brandham this man
[1:47:56] is a professor. He's a professor of
[1:47:58] history, religious history at the
[1:48:01] University of Birmingham, Alabama.
[1:48:05] He may have been there when the prophet
[1:48:06] of God spoke these words and said that
[1:48:10] this woman at the well could teach
[1:48:11] Birmingham something.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; She could teach the rest of the world
[1:48:17] something.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; She could teach those theological
[1:48:20] seminaries something.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; That's right,
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; sir. I perceive that you're a prophet.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. He read the thoughts that was in
[1:48:27] her heart.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; I've heard of it and we're looking for a
[1:48:31] Messiah
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; to come right away. He said, "I'm he
[1:48:35] that speaks to thee."
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; And when the Greeks said we would see
[1:48:40] Jesus, Jesus was there.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; And when the disciples wanted to see
[1:48:46] God, God was there.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; And even the disciples and the apostles
[1:48:50] couldn't grasp it.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; They couldn't even grasp that Elijah had
[1:48:54] already come. And it was that Lord had
[1:48:56] to work with them and work with them,
[1:48:58] but he did work with them because they
[1:48:59] were elect. And he's here with us today
[1:49:02] working with us because we are the elect
[1:49:05] of God.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; I say that with no apology.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; God's children are his elect. Amen.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; And when the str when the light struck
[1:49:21] the seed, she immediately went
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; into action.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Can I have just another few minutes,
[1:49:30] please?
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; I want so urgently to tell you about the
[1:49:35] veil between the church ages and the
[1:49:37] seals.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:44] I also say without apology, if God had
[1:49:48] not sent a prophet,
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; we'd still be out there in the courts
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; and using his words, probing
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; and assuming.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. What does Revelation
[1:50:04] 12 mean? I'm not too sure. What's
[1:50:06] Revelation 10 mean? What's the great
[1:50:08] angel, the mighty angels come? Well, who
[1:50:10] who knows? uh you know uh Armstrong says
[1:50:13] this or Shambach says that or or Robert
[1:50:16] says that and and we we maybe have our
[1:50:18] heroes that and other people that are
[1:50:20] outside but we we didn't have anybody in
[1:50:23] the crowd that could go in
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; the one that could go in now Christ had
[1:50:30] already gone in but now is a vessel here
[1:50:33] on earth that is to reveal Christ
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; and he can't reveal him in the outer
[1:50:38] court he has to reveal him as a high
[1:50:40] priest
[1:50:42] And that's why he preached. Who is this
[1:50:44] Melzdc? Melazedc wasn't out there.
[1:50:47] Melzdc's inside.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Melzdc's a high priest.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; And thus, thus you had to have a vessel
[1:50:56] who said, now I don't know what he said.
[1:51:00] Why? It's his voice speaking. The human
[1:51:03] flesh is speaking. Listen to me close
[1:51:05] now. The human flesh is speaking, but
[1:51:08] the one that's motivating them is not
[1:51:10] from the human the human element.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; It's the voice from inside the inner
[1:51:20] court that's speaking to people that are
[1:51:23] on the outside.
[1:51:25] [Music]
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; That's what a prophet is. Amen.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; A prophet didn't have his own thoughts.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; A prophet hasn't got his own thoughts.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; God simply takes hold of him and
[1:51:45] bypasses the mind and makes his lips and
[1:51:48] tongue speak.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Things that come from heaven
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; are things that come from the holiest of
[1:51:56] holies.
[1:51:58] And so the high priest,
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; take your take your
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; take your computer and put it in the
[1:52:05] high priest. She touched the high
[1:52:07] priest.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? How did he know she touched
[1:52:11] the high priest? How did he know that a
[1:52:13] man out there touched the high priest?
[1:52:15] Because he's the representative of the
[1:52:17] high priest.
[1:52:19] [Applause]
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; And he knew who was touching. He even
[1:52:23] knew the exact person.
[1:52:26] Yes sir.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; That man,
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; that woman,
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; this person,
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; you have touched the high priest.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; How did he know she he they touch the
[1:52:40] high priest? Because he was the
[1:52:42] representative
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; on earth.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; And then he would speak not his words,
[1:52:50] not William Brandham's words, the high
[1:52:53] priest's words.
[1:52:56] You're healed.
[1:52:57] [Applause]
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; You desire the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:01] Ghost. Who would know that? The high
[1:53:03] priest knew that because he's the
[1:53:06] baptizer.
[1:53:07] [Applause]
[1:53:10] [Music]
[1:53:10] [Applause]
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; And what has happened is that the holy
[1:53:15] flame of almighty God has pierced
[1:53:17] through the veil of his flesh.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. to penetrate the veil of your
[1:53:25] flesh
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; and invite you into the holiest of
[1:53:29] holies.
[1:53:31] [Music]
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; And for those who went in,
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; it was over.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; It's all over.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Bad times come.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Good times come. It's all over.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; It's cloudy.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; It's miserable. It's shiny. It's sunny.
[1:53:57] It's all over.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; People say this or people say that or
[1:54:03] your family thinks you went over the
[1:54:05] end.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Family thinks you're nuts.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; It's all over.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I've tasted it enough of it to
[1:54:21] tell you it's wonderful.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; You can become numb to the world.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Say they don't accept you or they reject
[1:54:32] you or this or that or the other thing
[1:54:34] or they think this about the message.
[1:54:36] You become numb to it.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Nothing else.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; And were multitudes. Multitudes.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. They came by the tens of thousands
[1:54:50] and by the hundreds of thousands.
[1:54:54] They were so close.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; They were so close
[1:55:02] and all he needed to do is recognize
[1:55:05] what it was.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:08] Just had to recognize.
[1:55:10] I think of that woman that was
[1:55:14] her her nephew is down I think in I
[1:55:18] think he's in brother Jason Jackson's
[1:55:20] church and brother Jason Jackson
[1:55:23] a pastor down Arkansas I he streams
[1:55:25] almost every Sunday. Brother Jason, if I
[1:55:28] don't have the story exactly right, then
[1:55:29] you can correct me.
[1:55:33] I believe the nephew of this woman or
[1:55:37] and but it was it was uh no, the son I
[1:55:40] believe of this woman, the son.
[1:55:43] Anyhow, they were in a car accident and
[1:55:47] she was paralyzed.
[1:55:49] She's been paralyzed for some time.
[1:55:51] She's laying in bed and the father, God
[1:55:54] bless her husband, God bless him, picked
[1:55:58] up the phone.
[1:56:00] He called through to brother Brham's
[1:56:03] phone number and caught him on the
[1:56:05] phone. That was a miracle
[1:56:07] and he told Brother Brham of his wife
[1:56:11] and she's laying in the bed. She's
[1:56:13] paralyzed from this accident.
[1:56:17] And brother Brham said, "Is she there?"
[1:56:20] said yes. Said let me speak with her.
[1:56:23] Gave her the phone. Brother Bram said
[1:56:26] these words as I understand it as
[1:56:28] accurate as possible.
[1:56:30] Sister, do you know who's speaking?
[1:56:33] She said, yes, you are William Brham,
[1:56:38] God's prophet.
[1:56:40] And he said, "Do you really believe
[1:56:42] that?" She said, "I certainly do."
[1:56:47] And he said, "God will honor that."
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; And she was instantly healed.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; She threw the cur the covers back and
[1:56:57] got up and cooked her husband's supper.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; She just recognized
[1:57:05] she was speaking to one directly into
[1:57:08] the Holy of Holies.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; All things are possible to them that
[1:57:13] have entered in.
[1:57:15] [Music]
[1:57:17] Hallelujah.
[1:57:21] [Music]
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; That is why friends
[1:57:28] now having having the Holy Spirit kind
[1:57:31] of deal with me the way that he has with
[1:57:33] this, I've decided to go through the
[1:57:35] seals again.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; We're going to read the seals
[1:57:40] because
[1:57:44] That's what was sealed and shrouded.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; That these were mysteries.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; They were mysteries. But finally,
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; we had a vessel.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; And he had to go into a special place.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; He had to he had to have it confirmed to
[1:58:01] him in a special way.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Talk about a special way. Yeah.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; How'd you like to have seven angels
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; come from the eternities in a split
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; to tell you where to go and what to do
[1:58:13] and to have a message? It wasn't for
[1:58:15] him, friends. It was for you and me.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; We can't leave that book lay on the
[1:58:20] shelf.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; We can't lay those things where you say,
[1:58:23] "Well, I get lost in the things that he
[1:58:25] talks about, oh, the Roman church and
[1:58:27] all the history and how it came on down
[1:58:29] in the great harlot church." You ought
[1:58:31] to thank God he saved you from that.
[1:58:35] You've been delivered from that.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; He's exposing your enemy.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:45] [Music]
[1:58:45] [Applause]
[1:58:47] [Music]
[1:58:54] Yes sir.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; And there'll be more on that.
[1:58:58] But now I close with this.
[1:59:04] Go home if you have time also
[1:59:07] and take the message. It's volume 91 I
[1:59:11] believe. The mighty God unveiled.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Tell you what friends be in a quiet
[1:59:19] prayerful attitude when you read that.
[1:59:23] It is so powerful.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; He talks about God being veiled and he
[1:59:27] go, "Oh, he's been veiled all this
[1:59:29] time." But when he gets to the end, he
[1:59:31] said, "Now,
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; he's veiled in you."
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; You are his veil.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; And that's where it really gets sticky.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; You can say amen all the way. He was
[1:59:43] veiled in a pillar of fire. Amen. He was
[1:59:45] veiled in Moses. Amen. He's veiled in
[1:59:48] the prophets. Amen. He was veiled in
[1:59:50] Jesus Christ. Amen. He's veiled in the
[1:59:53] apostles. Amen. But now it comes down.
[1:59:55] We have a prophet come unlike any that
[1:59:58] has ever ever lived since our Lord Jesus
[2:00:00] Christ. And he came here with a message.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; He came with a message and not not only
[2:00:05] a message but a manifestation showing
[2:00:08] that how God can function and work
[2:00:11] through a human vessel.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; And we can we can fully say amen and
[2:00:16] regard God was veiled in William Brham.
[2:00:20] But God always raised up prophets to
[2:00:23] demonstrate what he wanted for the
[2:00:25] people of that time.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; God is in God is in Christ.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; And all that was in Christ was poured
[2:00:34] into the church.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; The bride of Jesus Christ is God being
[2:00:39] expressed on the earth at this time.
[2:00:42] It's the only body that he's got to work
[2:00:44] in.
[2:00:49] You're God in the flesh to the people.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; And you're the only God they'll see.
[2:00:57] [Music]
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; You're the only God they'll hear.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; And for some, it'll be so close
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; and yet so far.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; But when you realize who's in you,
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; you can be like Christ was at the at the
[2:01:14] well. You can speak to them,
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; make them thirsty,
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; and somebody will finally come around
[2:01:21] your way and say, "Give me this water."
[2:01:25] [Applause]
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:28] [Music]
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Linda, I thought of the songs
[2:01:39] to your the words of your song and I
[2:01:42] have a couple here.
[2:01:48] But here's the words,
[2:01:50] and they're really marvelous. I don't
[2:01:52] know exactly
[2:01:55] when, but I think it's on the last
[2:01:58] record the girls sang. Let the curtain
[2:02:01] fall behind me,
[2:02:04] placing me within the inner veil
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; where the Lord is my soul companion.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; In his presence,
[2:02:15] peace and rest prevail.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; There's no need for the voice of
[2:02:20] another.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; There's no need for a comforting hand.
[2:02:28] In his strong arms of love, I'm
[2:02:30] unfolded.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Hidden from the world and its demands.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; Let the curtain fall behind me. Yes,
[2:02:40] sir.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; That's brother Brandham's phrase in the
[2:02:42] inner veil.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Placing me within the inner veil
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; where my soul can receive a refreshing.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; When the world outside has grown pale.
[2:02:55] Amen.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Here in silence,
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; the bread is broken.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Here in quiet himself, he reveals.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; All alone in the light of his presence.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; My life in communion. He seals.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; There's a holy fire that is burning.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:18] There's a flame that is touching my soul
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; face to face with my friend and my
[2:03:24] savior
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; here inside
[2:03:29] the inner veil.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh God,
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; I pray
[2:03:37] I pray that you and I will dwell there."
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Friends, we say this message. Let me
[2:03:45] close by saying the inner veil has been
[2:03:50] made available to you.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; We talk about a message that's why it
[2:03:56] came. Girls,
[2:03:59] families, boys.
[2:04:04] You don't want to stay outside.
[2:04:06] You hear this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. and I
[2:04:09] think this and I think that. You know,
[2:04:12] when we get all
[2:04:14] exercised about things,
[2:04:18] I invite you
[2:04:22] because I am thoroughly convinced it has
[2:04:25] been made available to us in this time.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; We didn't have this 100 years ago.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Didn't have it in previous ages. It's
[2:04:35] been a ma available to you.
[2:04:38] [Music]
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; I invite you to come into the inner
[2:04:47] veil.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Just inside
[2:04:55] the inner veil, there's a chorus we
[2:04:57] sing.
[2:05:00] And I wonder if we can sing it together.
[2:05:04] Just inside the veil.
[2:05:07] I long to see your face.
[2:05:14] [Music]
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Would you stand with me?
[2:05:24] [Music]
[2:05:33] I long to see your grace.
[2:05:40] Just to see your beauty there.
[2:05:46] Just beyond the ve
[2:05:51] just beyond the veil.
[2:05:56] I long to see your face.
[2:06:03] Just to see your beauty there
[2:06:08] just beyond the
[2:06:12] first place. You're the prince of peace.
[2:06:20] You're the prince of peace.
[2:06:26] You're the prince of peace. You are.
[2:06:32] You're the grace of me.

[2:07:07] [Music]
[2:07:11] just to see your beauty
[2:07:17] just beyond the
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; I want to say to every man, woman,
[2:07:27] child.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Within the sound of my voice,
[2:07:31] what I've spoken today,
[2:07:33] and I feel that God wants me to tell
[2:07:36] you, is your inheritance.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; What I've spoken today belongs to you.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Don't stay out in the cold. Don't stay
[2:07:47] out because everything happening outside
[2:07:50] this veil, it's going to continue.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; It'll be that way and worse next year.
[2:07:56] It'll be that way and worse in the
[2:07:58] future. Just say what the what the
[2:08:01] pastor has spoken today is for me.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; What the prophet of God, oh father, what
[2:08:06] your prophet brought is for us. And I
[2:08:10] can tell you friends, I wished I had
[2:08:12] more time, but I can tell you when when
[2:08:14] the seals were open, he spoke of the
[2:08:17] holy fire of God coming on the day of
[2:08:21] when Christ was was uh crucified. And he
[2:08:26] said, "And the holy fire of God toward
[2:08:28] that temple veil from top to bottom
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; and the mercy seat was brought into
[2:08:35] plain view." Amen.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; And then he says he's done the same
[2:08:38] today.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? He's done the same.
[2:08:44] If he's done the same, who did he do it
[2:08:45] for?
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Me.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; You.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; It's your portion.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan rob you of it. Say,
[2:08:56] "That's my portion.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; And I shall pursue that
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; and make changes."
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:09:05] Make a plan to change
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; to obtain it.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; Have time with him.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; Say it. I I I want to just sing a verse.
[2:09:20] I think it's the last verse of u
[2:09:26] I believe the true report.
[2:09:29] And then I'm going to ask brother
[2:09:33] Roy Floren if you'll prepare to come up
[2:09:35] and pray.
[2:09:37] Last verse. I'm within the holiest pale.
[2:09:42] I want you to sing it.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; Like you believe it. And if you haven't
[2:09:48] felt it, I don't care about this flesh.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; I want to know what the soul is saying.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; My soul is saying I'm within. Not I will
[2:09:59] be I'm within the holiest pale.

[2:12:04] A precious, loving, and most gracious
[2:12:08] heavenly father,
[2:12:11] we thank you for this fresh manner of
[2:12:15] your word that has come to fed our souls
[2:12:17] this morning.
[2:12:20] How thankful we are, Father, that we're
[2:12:23] recipients of such a wonderful, glorious
[2:12:27] word that has come in this generation.
[2:12:30] Father,
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; heavenly father, we thank you for the
[2:12:36] grace of God that has found each of
[2:12:39] every one of us here today, Father,
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; to be partakers of such a wonderful
[2:12:45] Savior, Father, this morning.
[2:12:48] [Music]
[2:12:50] Oh father, we thank you for the
[2:12:52] inspiration and the revelation of your
[2:12:54] word that has come to quicken a people
[2:12:57] and to make us ready to go beyond the
[2:13:00] veil this morning. Father,
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; thank you Lord.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; as we reminded Lord Jesus on that time
[2:13:11] when you were to go to the Feast of the
[2:13:14] Tabernacles. Father,
[2:13:18] Father, we thank you that we've gone
[2:13:20] beyond the veil. We've gone beyond the
[2:13:22] flesh and we've gone from darkness into
[2:13:25] light into your glorious light.
[2:13:30] We thank you father that we are not left
[2:13:33] on the outer veil in the outer court. So
[2:13:36] father where there's confusion and
[2:13:38] doubts where there is all kind of
[2:13:41] unbelief and gossip and things that are
[2:13:44] happening to tear down the inner veil
[2:13:47] father
[2:13:51] but we thank you Lord that you've made a
[2:13:54] way more perfectly in this generation by
[2:13:57] sending your holy prophet to show us the
[2:13:59] way into this inner veil. Father,
[2:14:03] [Music]
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; and I would pray this morning, oh God,
[2:14:07] that you would hear our prayers
[2:14:11] and that this living way would make be
[2:14:14] made perfect for each and everyone here
[2:14:16] today. Father,
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; for the youngest to the oldest,
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; for every son and daughter of God,
[2:14:24] Father,
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; for every child, oh God, even in their
[2:14:28] infancy, would be anointed with the holy
[2:14:31] anointing of God this morning to see
[2:14:34] that way that has been open for each and
[2:14:37] every one of us.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for your servant
[2:14:42] this morning. Amen.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; We pray that Lord you will continue to
[2:14:47] anoint him with the revelation of the
[2:14:49] word of God for this generation
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; to continue to empower your children oh
[2:14:55] God to take and to appre apprehend that
[2:14:59] which is ours in this generation.
[2:15:01] Father,
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; I was so blessed, oh God, to hear
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; that this inner veil
[2:15:11] is our dwelling place.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; It's our home, Father.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; It's the home for my family.
[2:15:20] It's the home for my children.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; It's the home for my brothers and
[2:15:25] sisters of like precious faith. Amen.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; Send out your holy anointing upon us
[2:15:33] this morning, oh God.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; And help us, we ask by the holy angels,
[2:15:42] Father, who are so charged in this
[2:15:44] environment this morning.
[2:15:48] We think, oh God, of this time, Lord,
[2:15:51] when the tabernacle, Father, the the
[2:15:55] holiest of all, his angels, Lord, the
[2:15:57] two saraphims who were there to guard
[2:16:00] the word that was inside. Father, I pray
[2:16:04] that these angels, these Pharohims who
[2:16:06] were here today will guard that word
[2:16:09] into our souls today. Father,
[2:16:12] [Music]
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; Father, we just pray, oh God, that you
[2:16:17] will continue to unveil yourself even
[2:16:20] more
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; that we as your sons and daughters will
[2:16:24] manifest Christ in the fullness of the
[2:16:27] revelation of the word that has come for
[2:16:30] us this day. Lord,
[2:16:33] we ask you to bless the young ones who
[2:16:35] will come to know you by the waters of
[2:16:39] baptism tonight, Father.
[2:16:43] We pray that Lord, it will be a living
[2:16:45] reality for each one of our young
[2:16:47] brothers. Lord, and they will grow to be
[2:16:50] mighty warriors of the faith. Oh God,
[2:16:54] anoint them and bless them, Father, with
[2:16:56] a holy anointing and fill them with the
[2:16:59] Holy Spirit.
[2:17:01] We thank you father for this moment of
[2:17:04] time that we are able to share in your
[2:17:06] presence. We pray that your blessing
[2:17:08] will be on each one your sons and
[2:17:11] daughters today and we'll go far for
[2:17:13] father with that great anointing upon us
[2:17:16] to continue to manifest Christ. We pray
[2:17:20] for brother John this evening Lord as he
[2:17:22] will come with the word. Father, we are
[2:17:24] in high expectation, Father, that you
[2:17:26] will speak once again. Lord, bless your
[2:17:29] servants. Bless your people. Father, as
[2:17:32] we leave this place, may you go with us.
[2:17:35] We pray in the precious name of our Lord
[2:17:37] and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen and amen.
