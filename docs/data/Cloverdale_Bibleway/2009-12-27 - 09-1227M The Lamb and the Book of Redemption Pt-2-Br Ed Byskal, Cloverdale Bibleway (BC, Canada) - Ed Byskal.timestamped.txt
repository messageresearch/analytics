[19:19] Alex or dileier if you'd come, brother
[19:21] Alex, and open the service in a word of
[19:23] prayer. Sister Lori writes in a
[19:25] testimony. She wants to thank the Lord
[19:26] Jesus for a physical healing and signs
[19:29] of a spiritual healing in progress after
[19:31] the ministry prayed for her daughter
[19:33] Christine and grandson Joshua. So we
[19:37] thank the Lord for that. Rejoice with
[19:39] Sister Lori. If you have a need on your
[19:41] heart as we go to prayer this morning,
[19:43] just lift it up before the Lord. Those
[19:45] that are sick and body, those on the
[19:47] internet hookup that couldn't be with us
[19:49] this morning, may the Lord Jesus touch
[19:51] you right where you are this morning.
[19:53] And brother Alex, why don't you come? If
[19:55] you have a need, just make it known by
[19:57] the uplifted hand as we go to prayer.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; Precious heavenly father, it's privilege
[20:05] this morning to be here in the house of
[20:07] God, the house of worship.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord, for we know that
[20:12] we're going to hear from God this
[20:14] morning.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; Oh God, this is so wonderful.
[20:20] This is not just a man that's going to
[20:21] come here, Lord.
[20:23] It's you that going to speak to us, Lord
[20:26] Jesus.
[20:27] As I was reading this morning, Lord, the
[20:30] bridge, oh my father, thank you. I ask
[20:34] you, Lord, that you give understanding
[20:36] to each one in the presence of God this
[20:38] morning. Help us, Lord, to understand
[20:41] what you have done for us, to take a
[20:44] hold of it, Lord Jesus,
[20:47] to really have the revelation in our
[20:49] soul and put us into action, Lord Jesus.
[20:53] Oh heavenly father have mercy upon us.
[20:55] Help us Lord.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Lord let the man of God come forth Lord.
[21:02] I can even say let the lamp come forth
[21:05] this morning Lord through the vessel of
[21:08] brother Elis.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; And he's going to speak to us the words
[21:12] of life. We can receive it into our
[21:15] soul.
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Help us Lord. We commit this gathering
[21:20] to you Lord.
[21:22] Lead us and guide us Lord. Have the
[21:23] preeminence in our lives. Help us Lord
[21:26] to overcome in this evil day. We commit
[21:30] this day into your hands now the
[21:31] preaching of the word. In Jesus Christ's
[21:34] name we pray. Amen.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:38] Amen. God bless you saints. You may have
[21:40] your seats. So good to
[21:44] so good to have everyone here this
[21:45] morning. We're going to have our Sunday
[21:47] school come and bless us with a little
[21:49] song this morning. So why don't they
[21:50] come on in there Sunday school? God
[21:54] bless you all the parents that are
[21:55] represented here. Give you thanks for
[21:57] each one of their lives and trust that
[22:00] the Lord deals with them at an early
[22:02] age. May this be a testimony this
[22:04] morning. Brother Tom, did you want to
[22:06] come and make an announcement?
[22:08] &gt;&gt; God bless you and good morning. Looking
[22:10] forward to a wonderful watch night
[22:12] service on Thursday night. There won't
[22:14] be a Wednesday service, of course. We'll
[22:16] have that on Thursday. Brother Biscll
[22:18] has uh got a direction that we're going
[22:20] to be going. So, it's going to be a
[22:22] wonderful time and um there's been a
[22:25] request that those that would like to

[22:30] the uh service in the chapel. Um we're
[22:34] going to uh be more orientated towards
[22:37] uh a mission direction. I'm sure brother
[22:39] Bisco will uh fill you in on that. But
[22:42] we will be filling in with different
[22:43] songs and specials through the night and
[22:46] some we'll be able to use and some we'll

[22:50] year. So if you're willing to be able to

[22:56] desiring. So God bless you. And again,
[22:59] they're meeting right after the service
[23:01] in the chapel.
[24:11] We follow the star, rejoice in his day.
[24:16] Walk in his light and we can't be the
[24:19] same. We give in our substance and all
[24:24] that we are. We lay down our lives and
[24:27] we follow the stars.
[24:31] East
[24:33] and song to place where they knew the
[24:37] Savior was born. We sing his life. They
[24:42] boldly proclaim.
[24:45] We come to worship his name.
[24:49] We follow the star, rejoice in his name,
[24:54] walk in his light, and we can't be the
[24:58] same. We give it ourselves
[25:01] and all that we are. We lay down our
[25:05] lives and we follow the stars. In the
[25:09] time of the evening, there shall be a
[25:12] light. The whole world is croping,
[25:16] searching for life. So the message has
[25:19] come. Its voice has been heard. And we
[25:24] have returned to the world.
[25:28] We follow the star, rejoice in his name,
[25:33] walk in his light and we can't be the
[25:36] same. We give it our substance and all
[25:40] that we are. We lay down our lives and
[25:44] we follow the star.
[25:47] Let us do.
[25:50] Let us do life.
[25:52] Let us do our place in the body of
[25:55] Christ.
[25:57] led us to healing and peace in our
[26:00] hearts.
[26:02] This time he's leading us all.
[26:06] We follow the star. Rejoice in his name.
[26:11] Walk in his light and we can't be the
[26:14] same. We give in our justice and all
[26:18] that we are. We lay down our lives and
[26:22] we follow the star. We follow the star,
[26:27] rejoice in his name, walk in his light,
[26:32] and we can't be the same. We give it our
[26:36] substance in all that we are. We lay
[26:40] down our lives, and we follow the star.
[26:44] We give it our substance in all that we
[26:47] are.
[26:50] We lay down our lives and we follow the
[26:53] star. We lay down our lives and we
[26:57] follow the star.
[27:08] [Music]
[27:17] Aren't they beautiful?
[27:19] &gt;&gt; You better give them another hand.
[27:28] Wonderful. Wonderful
[27:32] jewels.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; If you can receive it.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. These are the jewels. God bless
[27:38] you children. Thank you so much for
[27:39] singing. We certainly certainly
[27:41] appreciate that. Well, one day we're all
[27:45] going to get to heaven and we won't be
[27:48] necessarily little children, but in
[27:50] order to get there, we must be children
[27:51] at heart.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:55] When the redeemed are gathering in,
[27:57] there's a rapture that comes after all
[27:59] of this.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Job had a vision of the resurrection
[28:03] sitting on his ash heap, no matter how
[28:05] bad it gets.
[28:07] We trust that you get that resurrection
[28:09] vision. Amen. No matter how tough the
[28:11] times come, brother Brennham used to
[28:14] say, "No matter how dark the night,
[28:17] you just call me and I'll be there." And
[28:18] I believe that that's the heart of the
[28:19] Lord Jesus.
[28:22] Let's sing this together as we get ready
[28:23] to turn the service to brother Ed. I
[28:25] think it's a rejoicing time, friends.
[28:27] Somebody got after me the other day for
[28:28] singing an Easter song on Christmas Day.
[28:31] I said, "Well, they're tied together.
[28:34] The birth of a child speaks of a
[28:37] resurrection.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing it together, shall we?
[28:44] I am thinking of a rapture in our
[28:48] blessing on high
[29:01] in the sky.
[29:08] [Applause]
[29:11] Heat.
[29:22] Heat. Heat.
[29:32] There will be a great procession over
[29:36] all
[29:45] music singing for city.
[29:49] [Music]
[30:04] [Music]
[30:08] I shall
[30:11] see
[30:14] when the redee
[30:19] [Music]
[30:22] with their voice is clear and strong.
[30:26] When the redee
[30:28] are gathering in
[30:31] then the angels all listen for they
[30:35] cannot join that song when we
[30:40] Yeah.
[30:43] Heat.
[30:54] [Music]
[30:57] We will have
[31:01] there when we did
[31:04] our
[31:07] then the Savior
[31:10] to prepare the banquet
[31:13] when we need
[31:16] our gathering in
[31:19] and we'll hear the invitation of Jesus.
[31:23] Heat. Heat.
[31:34] [Applause]
[31:37] Watch my soul.
[31:43] I will shout
[31:46] and I will sing
[31:49] with you.
[31:51] [Music]
[31:53] Let's all put our hands together now.
[32:01] [Music]
[32:04] Hallelujah.
[32:05] [Music]
[32:10] Let's
[32:13] [Music]
[32:15] all get
[32:18] [Music]
[32:22] [Applause]
[32:24] [Music]
[32:28] Yeah.
[32:36] When the redeemer
[32:39] [Music]
[33:02] [Music]
[33:08] Hallelujah.
[33:10] That ought to make anybody happy.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; One of my favorite songs. Amen. Well,
[33:17] you may be seated. I'm just going to
[33:19] take a couple of minutes here
[33:22] before we read the word. Uh, want to
[33:25] thank you all for
[33:27] [Music]
[33:28] being here.
[33:30] If you weren't here, we'd have no one to
[33:32] preach to. So, that would be a sad
[33:35] thing, wouldn't it? And uh this is a
[33:38] time, you know, we're coming to the end
[33:41] of this year 209.
[33:44] It's uh I think it's 44 years. Uh
[33:49] Brother Brandham's passing the other day
[33:52] on the 24th.
[33:54] 44 years. And uh well that's like a
[33:58] double deliverance for supposed to be
[34:00] deliverance.
[34:03] So it's a great time that we have come
[34:05] to and every time I hear brother
[34:08] Brandham come to the end of a year and
[34:09] look forward to the next year always
[34:12] says we're looking forward to a great
[34:17] things
[34:19] looking forward to less but looking
[34:21] forward to greater things.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; And I think that's the way we ought to
[34:25] be. I'm here to do my very best. I
[34:29] believe uh musicians uh everyone else I
[34:32] believe you're here to do your very
[34:34] best. We ought to make a we don't make
[34:37] resolutions. We ought to make a resolve
[34:40] that we are prepared to rally to do
[34:44] more. We're prepared to pull our
[34:48] strength and all of our resources
[34:51] together to do more for God. Uh, we
[34:55] don't know how much time we have. Well,
[34:57] one thing is sure, you're going to cross
[34:59] over.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; I'm going to cross over. And then our
[35:03] labors are done.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; I'm sure every one of us want to do
[35:08] everything we can while we have breath,
[35:12] while we have strength, while we have
[35:14] our mental uh capacity and and
[35:17] faculties. We want to do everything we
[35:20] can, do we not?
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. you join with me on that.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything that we can. And so
[35:28] we're in a a marvelous hour, friends. Uh
[35:32] uh God has sent us a message that is
[35:35] just the rarest
[35:38] the rarest and most wonderful thing.
[35:41] It's not just mentally intoxicating.
[35:43] That's not what I'm talking about. It's
[35:45] something that physically does something
[35:48] to you physically. And it's moving. If
[35:51] you will allow it, it will move you and
[35:53] take you into another place. And that's
[35:55] kind of I have to be careful. I will be
[35:58] starting to invade on my service.
[36:03] On Thursday evening, we're going to
[36:04] start at 9:00
[36:07] and we have uh uh I just felt that this
[36:12] year maybe we'll do something just a wee
[36:13] bit different. part of it. You know, our
[36:17] our congregation
[36:19] has been so blessed with so many
[36:21] different uh uh groups, ethnic groups
[36:26] from different parts of the country and
[36:28] the world. And I just thought, you know,
[36:31] we should have some of these uh sing two
[36:35] or three pieces for us. I thought of
[36:38] having the uh Africa represented. We
[36:42] have the congalles people and let them
[36:45] come and some might say, "Oh, I don't
[36:47] sing." Well, we won't know any
[36:48] difference.
[36:51] There are some that do sing and they
[36:52] sing wonderfully. Uh I've spoken to
[36:56] sister Okeello and I think brother
[36:58] Gilbert is here has arrived and we want
[37:01] them to sing. Uh, I enjoyed our sister
[37:05] Lois when she sang, but but she she can
[37:09] sing al also, I'm sure, in her in her
[37:12] Kenyan language as well. The whole
[37:14] family, and I think that would be nice.
[37:17] We have Russian people are here. Uh, we
[37:21] have Spanish people that are here. And,
[37:24] uh, I think we might as you know what
[37:26] the Bible says, the tribes and the
[37:29] nations and the tongues.
[37:36] So, we'll hear them sing in tongues.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; The Chinese, we've got them all lined
[37:43] up. And we might even have some English.
[37:47] I think that'll be great.
[37:50] And uh I've kind of put the finger on
[37:52] our brother Nathan and sister Corin.
[37:55] We've had Nathan up and sing lots of
[37:57] time, but Sister Corin and she she let
[37:59] me know that he even he even knows a few
[38:02] courses in in in Cree. So, we'll have
[38:05] maybe some of the native uh I could even
[38:09] sing a a course in in a native tongue,
[38:12] but not very good.
[38:15] So, I would need a lot of people to
[38:17] cover up for me. Uh so that'll be
[38:20] Thursday evening and some testimony and
[38:23] it's going to be a wonderful evening of
[38:24] fellowship and and and worship. Uh
[38:28] brother and sister Codle have called and
[38:31] they wanted to be remembered to you.
[38:34] They're with some family members in in
[38:36] Florida and they said uh that they want
[38:38] to extend their greetings to the
[38:41] congregation. They miss being with you
[38:43] and they expect to be back about May.
[38:46] Brother Billy Ler, who I don't think uh
[38:51] very few of you know at least. Brother
[38:52] Billy and I have been very dear friends
[38:56] since about
[38:58] in the 1970s.
[39:01] And he just keeps calling oh all the
[39:04] time on a regular basis. And he and
[39:07] about 14 others went down to Jamaica
[39:09] just got back. And I don't know if
[39:12] you've heard on the news that one
[39:14] American Airlines plane uh that overshot
[39:19] the runway a wee bit and I understand
[39:21] broke into three pieces. Well, it it it
[39:24] just happened one day before they were
[39:26] coming back to United States and uh uh
[39:31] but they were coming from a different I
[39:32] believe that happened at at Kingston,
[39:35] Jamaica, and they were flying in and out
[39:37] of Montego Bay. Uh but we're always
[39:40] happy when uh people they weren't down
[39:43] there for vacation, they were down there
[39:44] with brother Reed. Some of you may have
[39:46] met Brother Reed during the 207
[39:49] convention because he was here uh from
[39:53] from Jamaica and and uh uh really a
[39:57] lovely brother. So they know him and
[40:00] they went down there and I believe that
[40:02] brother Brad, their pastor, took a
[40:04] service. There was about 15 of them all
[40:07] together. But he's he's burdened for
[40:10] India. I didn't get a chance to tell
[40:11] you, brother Kim, but he wants to put
[40:13] another print station in India, and he
[40:16] has a specific brother that he wants to
[40:19] uh send it to. So, they just keep uh
[40:23] going all the time. I'm hoping that we
[40:25] can have for this next year a big map
[40:28] and maybe a whole hub print area right
[40:31] in the in the foyer there. It's uh it's
[40:35] a just a it's such a wonderful thing,
[40:37] friends. I am so enthused and happy
[40:40] about that. I I can't describe to you. I
[40:44] guess maybe it comes from being in so
[40:46] many places and having people look into
[40:49] your face and I know that I got red
[40:52] volumes and there's brother Mless's
[40:54] brown volumes and I got MP3s and you've
[40:58] got every kind. You've got it in every
[41:01] format possible. I've got individual
[41:03] books. I've got some printed, most of
[41:06] them printed by spoken word, then voice
[41:08] of God, and then and then brother Harold
[41:11] Hilderbrand filled in for those that
[41:13] were you couldn't get anymore. And I've
[41:16] had people here and even of our own
[41:18] congregation as as they were getting
[41:21] saved and coming and says they'd see my
[41:23] Hebrew series and says, "Where can I get
[41:25] a Hebrew series?" I'm sorry, you can't
[41:28] get a Hebrew series. They're they're
[41:30] been out out of circulation for a long
[41:33] time. And uh and and then people I've
[41:36] been over in other countries and had
[41:38] them look with their dark lovely
[41:40] sparkling eyes and and just where can I
[41:45] can I get a book? I've I've been with
[41:48] people where the message was written on
[41:51] brown paper bags
[41:55] and translated. I have Russian messages
[41:58] that have been written by hand. I've
[42:00] been in a brother Joseph's home or in a
[42:04] home with him in Romania where he had
[42:07] the pieces of of the paper translated
[42:10] and slipped under a double floor in a
[42:14] rabbit cage.
[42:17] And you know all you have to do and
[42:20] that's just in the short period of time
[42:22] of my lifetime friends. And then to to
[42:25] find it that you have it. And people
[42:28] today, they can just they can either get
[42:31] it by by a disc or have it and and bring
[42:34] it down out of the skies. And people
[42:37] today, I mean, they're excited. If
[42:39] Brother Kim was up here, he'd just tell
[42:41] you. And the Spanish-sp speakaking
[42:43] peoples of Central and South America,
[42:45] they are they are outstripping the even
[42:48] the English speakaking about 6,000. What
[42:50] is it per month downloads? 6,000
[42:54] downloads a month and it's just in in uh
[42:58] incredible. It's hard to fathom. So, I
[43:01] just say praise be to God.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; And that's not our doing. We're just
[43:07] behind it. Anybody's got a computer.
[43:09] Anybody can go to uh any store and buy a
[43:13] HP printer. It's not just a bunch of
[43:16] mechanics, friends. It is that a person
[43:19] can finally get a message in their hand
[43:22] and begin to read things that they've
[43:24] never heard before.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; How many of you read the messages? You
[43:28] read things that you wonder if you even
[43:30] read it before. You read the seals
[43:32] again. I just had uh brother Milco
[43:35] because I said last last uh service,
[43:38] read the breach. He said, I read the
[43:41] breach. It was just like it was all new
[43:43] to me. I want to thank you for having us
[43:46] read the breach.
[43:47] Amen. Hallelujah. Well, let's stand
[43:52] before I start preaching.
[43:56] Thank you, brother Ryan. Joanne,
[43:58] musicians.
[44:01] And just before we open the word, we're
[44:02] going to read in Hebrews. But before we
[44:04] do, let's just talk to the author.
[44:09] Gracious and lovely, lovely Lord Jesus,
[44:14] &gt;&gt; you are lovely.
[44:17] Your spirit is so warm and welcoming
[44:20] &gt;&gt; and we want to welcome you. Welcome.
[44:22] Welcome, Holy Ghost. We welcome thee.
[44:26] Lord,
[44:26] &gt;&gt; how beloved and how lovely you are,
[44:29] Lord, to us.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; You've carried us through another year.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; You have fed us.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; You've led us. You've opened your word.
[44:38] You sent your presence to us. You lifted
[44:41] us up when we were heavy. When our
[44:43] hearts were heavy, Lord, you lifted us
[44:46] up, oh God, when we were in a state of
[44:49] indecision, perhaps didn't know just
[44:51] exactly what to do. You were there for
[44:54] the for us each one. You have led us as
[44:57] a as a great shepherd. And how we thank
[45:00] you for that, Lord. Oh, how wonderful
[45:03] you are today, Lord. I know that you'll
[45:06] come again. Your Holy Spirit will come
[45:08] to each one that is here. Help, I pray,
[45:12] the people so that they will be not only
[45:15] thankful, but they will be keen to hear
[45:19] what you have for them. Perhaps it's
[45:21] just a sentence or just a few words in
[45:24] the in the oncoming service. Help me to
[45:27] say what I'm supposed to say, Lord. I
[45:30] put a put a seal upon my lips. I will
[45:32] not say anything that should not be
[45:35] spoken. I pray, oh God, you'll forgive
[45:38] us our transgressions and forgive us
[45:40] anything that has been done that we've
[45:42] done wrong. Oh God, forgive us, oh Lord
[45:46] Jesus, for our frailties and our
[45:48] weaknesses. And I pray that you'll
[45:50] strengthen us and fill our hearts with
[45:52] strength and courage. And I ask, oh God,
[45:55] that we may move forward, oh Lord, in
[45:58] this glorious hour in the name of Jesus
[46:01] Christ for your anointing. Now we pray.
[46:04] Amen. Amen.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh I'm going to read out of
[46:09] Hebrews the third chapter
[46:12] and we'll just read the last uh two
[46:15] verses
[46:17] uh verse 18 and 19.
[46:24] Have to be a little bit patient with me.
[46:26] I've I've got a new Bible.
[46:30] I've had the Bible for a long time, but
[46:33] uh I have I have such a hard time
[46:36] letting go of my old Bibles
[46:40] and uh so I just have a new one and and
[46:44] struggle around with it. But I always
[46:46] buy the same Bible.
[46:48] I was carrying it one day and Brother
[46:50] Bram says, "Oh," he said, "I see that
[46:52] you have a Scoffield Bible." Oh, yeah. I
[46:55] said that I have a Scullfield. He said,
[46:57] "I I kind of like old Dr. Scoffield." He
[47:00] said, "I carry exactly the same Bible.
[47:03] It made me feel better."
[47:07] All right.
[47:09] Uh verse 18 and 19.
[47:14] And to whom swear he that they should
[47:17] not enter into his rest, but to them
[47:20] that believe not. So we see that they
[47:24] could not enter in because of unbelief.
[47:28] We'll carry on with chapter 4. Let us
[47:30] therefore fear lest a promise being left
[47:33] us of entering into his rest any of you
[47:36] should seem to come short of it. For
[47:40] unto us was the gospel preached as well
[47:43] as unto them. But the word preached did
[47:46] not profit them, not being mixed with
[47:49] faith in them that heard it. So the
[47:53] gospel was fine and the preaching was
[47:56] fine. We assume that. But they couldn't
[47:59] enter into this rest, into his rest,
[48:02] into this certain place because of their
[48:06] unbelief. And it was not mixed with
[48:09] faith. For we which have believed do
[48:12] enter into rest, as he said, as I have
[48:16] sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter
[48:18] into my rest, although the works were
[48:21] finished from the foundation of the
[48:24] world. For he spake in a certain place
[48:26] of the seventh day on this wise. And God
[48:30] did rest the seventh day from all his
[48:33] works. And in this place again, if they
[48:37] shall enter into my rest, seeing
[48:40] therefore it remainth that some must
[48:43] enter therein. And they to whom it was
[48:46] first preached entered not in because of
[48:49] unbelief. Again he limitth a certain
[48:52] day, saying in David, today after so
[48:56] long a time, as it is said, Today if you
[49:00] will hear his voice, harden not your
[49:03] hearts. For if Jesus, and that is
[49:05] Joshua,
[49:07] had given them rest, then would he not
[49:10] afterward have spoken of another day,
[49:13] there remainth therefore a rest to the
[49:16] people of God. For he that is entered
[49:19] into his rest, he also hath ceased from
[49:23] his own works, as God did from his. Let
[49:27] us labor therefore to enter into that
[49:31] rest, lest any man fall uh fall after
[49:35] the same example of unbelief. Now notice
[49:38] verse 12, how almost out of context it
[49:42] is. For the word of God is quick and
[49:45] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[49:48] sword, piercing even to the dividing
[49:51] aunderder of soul and spirit, and of the
[49:54] joints and marrow, and is a discerner of
[49:56] the thoughts and intents of the heart.
[49:59] God bless the word and each of you as
[50:02] you have your seats. And I'll ask for
[50:05] your undivided attention
[50:08] and really be as focused as possible and
[50:12] ask God to give you
[50:16] uh spiritual understanding.
[50:20] Sometimes it seems uh you know for a
[50:23] minister you start to you get into areas
[50:26] that are uh even for myself as familiar
[50:31] as I am with the message and the
[50:33] scripture and all these years yet
[50:35] sometime you begin to feel that you're
[50:38] almost being overwhelmed not almost but
[50:41] are overwhelmed. So if you don't
[50:44] understand everything, don't don't shut
[50:47] your mind off. Just uh open up and say,
[50:50] "Well, it might be tomorrow or the next
[50:53] week or whatever, but I I need this
[50:55] because the Holy Spirit will bring it
[50:58] back to your remembrance."
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Now the scripture, I just want to make
[51:04] some statements first here.
[51:07] The scriptures are uh a multi-layered
[51:13] in their meaning. Brother Brandham uses
[51:15] the word compound. The same thing will
[51:18] have compound meaning. It'll also have
[51:21] references. It could have references to
[51:24] those in the Old Testament and those in
[51:26] the New Testament. Uh and so the the
[51:30] meanings are layered.
[51:32] If you were to take uh the descriptions
[51:36] of Jesus Christ for example, and I know
[51:38] that you'll readily accept there's many
[51:40] many descriptions of him, you know, he's
[51:43] the anointed one, he's the blessed one,
[51:45] he's the root, he's the branch, he's the
[51:48] son of man, he's the son of David, he's
[51:50] the son of God, he's uh all of these
[51:53] things. He's the judge. He's the he's
[51:56] the savior. He's the redeemer. He's the
[51:58] healer. And you can go on and on. And I
[52:01] have a h I have a long list that has
[52:05] been accumulated which I wouldn't have
[52:07] time to read this morning which starts
[52:09] at A and ends at Z. And it's just an
[52:13] incredible probably uh probably maybe
[52:17] close to a hundred descriptions of Jesus
[52:20] Christ. And then it goes on to the
[52:24] believer and to the bride of Christ and
[52:26] all of the things. So it's multi-layered
[52:29] and and and there are different phrases
[52:33] in the scripture which which brother
[52:35] Brandham says you have to see Christ in
[52:37] every verse. And I know I I sometimes
[52:40] take that in fact as I often do and read
[52:43] that and I know what he said and I think
[52:45] now now where's Christ in that?
[52:49] It's good for us to be uh to to be
[52:53] inquisitive as children
[52:55] &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, you know, just I'm I'm
[52:57] willing to learn. I want to hear. I want
[53:00] to know. I want to be benefited. I don't
[53:03] want to remember. I don't want to remain
[53:05] in some cloud or some fog. Let my mind
[53:08] not be clouded up with this world. Let
[53:11] me be just as clear and focused as I can
[53:14] on these things."
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now the scripture here is
[53:18] speaking so much of rest and then it
[53:21] drops down and says for the word of God
[53:23] is quick and powerful and sharper than
[53:25] any two-edged sword and as a discerner
[53:28] of the thoughts and intents of the
[53:29] heart. It's very very interesting to
[53:34] realize that that scripture is one I
[53:37] would say perhaps the second most
[53:41] uh used of brother Brham regarding his
[53:44] own ministry.
[53:47] And now let's just take that for a
[53:50] moment. So I here's where I have to, you
[53:53] know, h really have you thinking with
[53:55] me. So now, brother Brandham is coming
[53:58] in a first pull of his ministry
[54:02] and it it's in in healing and and those
[54:06] things which he says is a minor thing
[54:08] but nevertheless God found it was
[54:11] necessary
[54:13] sending the spirit of Elijah to the
[54:16] people to catch their attention. And so
[54:20] he takes that revealing the secret of
[54:22] their heart and he said would it help
[54:26] you to believe? That's the key. Would it
[54:29] help you to believe if I told you your
[54:32] name or would it help you to believe if
[54:36] he told if he told you where you came
[54:39] from or where you live? It would it help
[54:42] you to believe? And so the whole purpose
[54:45] of it was to help the people. The
[54:48] discernment of the hearts and intents,
[54:50] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[54:53] was to cause the people to believe.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; And by believing then they could enter
[54:58] in to the promise.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Are you following that? And so now all
[55:04] of the scripture which we read says they
[55:07] can't enter into my rest and because of
[55:09] unbelief and in the day of temptation in
[55:12] the wilderness and the day of
[55:13] provocation and and so we see that they
[55:16] could not enter in because of unbelief.
[55:19] And that's why that scriptures dropped
[55:20] in there at the end and it remainth that
[55:23] there is a rest for the people of God.
[55:25] And so God drops in and says and and for
[55:28] the word of God is quick and powerful
[55:31] and sharper than any two-edged sword.
[55:33] Pentecost and so many people missed it
[55:36] because when they saw it happening and
[55:38] demonstrated manifesting in front of
[55:40] them, they thought well it's a gift of
[55:41] the Holy Spirit because they were gift
[55:43] conscious or some kind. And he says some
[55:46] think it's mental telepathy. One think
[55:48] it's mind readading or something else.
[55:50] No, he says and he quoted this
[55:52] scripture, the word of God is a
[55:54] discerner of the thoughts and the
[55:55] intents of the heart. And so then when
[55:58] it happened, they thought, oh, isn't
[55:59] this wonderful? God knows that, you
[56:01] know, I got somebody home and sick and
[56:02] they're they're they've got sugar
[56:04] diabetes or they've got cancer or I need
[56:07] an answer for this or I need an answer
[56:09] for that and and I wonder about this and
[56:12] I have these questions and oh, isn't it
[56:14] wonderful? We can come before uh God's
[56:17] prophet. I believe he's God's prophet.
[56:18] That's all lovely and that's all
[56:20] wonderful, but that wasn't the whole
[56:22] purpose of it. The purpose is that that
[56:24] they people would come to a place of
[56:26] faith
[56:28] &gt;&gt; and enter into God's rest.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; And this is a land and this is a time.
[56:34] This is a season. And God knew that this
[56:37] would have to be perfectly manifested in
[56:40] its full manifestation in this hour
[56:43] because this would be a day of all days
[56:47] &gt;&gt; that we would need to enter in to a
[56:49] rest.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to read some statements.
[56:59] On the seventh day,
[57:02] God rested from all his work.
[57:06] So he entered into a rest.
[57:10] In this rest period or this rest time,
[57:15] Satan crept in beneath the garden
[57:19] garden wall.
[57:21] Now when God I may repeat some of these
[57:24] things as we go on. When God created the
[57:28] whole creation,
[57:30] which certainly would have encompassed
[57:32] the globe, I'm sure he did his creation.
[57:35] The earth appeared, the waters had their
[57:38] bounds, and the heavens and everything
[57:41] was set in a certain motion. And I would
[57:45] have to say if it was God's creation,
[57:48] which it was, it was a perfect creation.
[57:52] But now within that perfection,
[57:56] God
[57:58] planted a garden
[58:01] &gt;&gt; called Eden.
[58:03] So we often think, well, Eden must have
[58:05] been a perfect place. No, the whole
[58:07] creation was a perfect creation.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; But within that creation, God plants God
[58:15] has a he planted a garden.
[58:18] And there would be the place for his son
[58:23] and his bride, his wife. It'd be a place
[58:28] where God,
[58:30] it was a special place
[58:33] place.
[58:36] And so Satan entered
[58:40] and crept in to the beneath the garden
[58:43] wall.
[58:45] And in this garden, the serpent
[58:48] approached
[58:50] Adam's bride.
[58:52] And I will call her Adam's garden bride
[58:58] &gt;&gt; because she was the place for his seed.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; A garden is where seeds are planted.
[59:10] And in the midst of this Eden, in the
[59:12] midst of this garden, was a tree called
[59:16] the tree of life,
[59:20] which was none other than Christ
[59:23] &gt;&gt; himself.
[59:27] Jesus Christ, the tree of life,
[59:31] is God's Sabbath.
[59:35] It's the only
[59:37] record that we have when God had
[59:40] finished Eden and he rested from his
[59:43] work.
[59:44] But we don't have any record where God
[59:47] has spoken in any part of the scripture
[59:49] says, "Oh my beloved Eden,
[59:53] I'm so satisfied with my Eden." No, it
[59:59] wasn't Eden that he was thrilled with.
[1:00:01] But when his son came on the scene, he
[1:00:05] said, "This is my beloved son
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; in whom I am well pleased."
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; He would have his rest
[1:00:15] in that son. And while Satan attempted
[1:00:19] to come to him in the wilderness,
[1:00:23] attempted to persuade him to worship
[1:00:28] Satan himself, he came to God's rest.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; He came to God's place of rest
[1:00:39] and attempted to disturb that rest.
[1:00:44] Satan, if you'll fall down and worship
[1:00:46] me, and that was just too much. Get
[1:00:49] behind me, Satan,
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
[1:00:56] And he he just quoted him the scripture.
[1:01:00] But nevertheless,
[1:01:02] this one who God said spoke, "This is my
[1:01:06] beloved son more than once. Hear ye
[1:01:09] him."
[1:01:10] It was he that went to Calvary and did
[1:01:15] the redeeming work and paid the price
[1:01:19] for redemption.
[1:01:21] And because God's justice was satisfied,
[1:01:26] God's judgment was already fulfilled
[1:01:30] when the price was paid. And the earth
[1:01:34] which was lost by the first Adam is
[1:01:37] purchased back by the second Adam. And
[1:01:40] there's no wonder the creator could say
[1:01:42] he's at rest
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; with this son.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; And it was not just that it would be his
[1:01:52] rest, but then he puts it forward. This
[1:01:55] is also your rest because he's the one
[1:01:59] that is doing the work of redemption
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; with the first Adam in Eden.
[1:02:10] Help me now.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; In the first Adam in Eden,
[1:02:17] there was a
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; it was uh
[1:02:23] well, this is a little bit difficult to
[1:02:24] explain, but
[1:02:27] Satan came through the serpent
[1:02:31] to bring a distress and to upset and to
[1:02:35] bring the fall. So now he approaches. He
[1:02:39] doesn't just come to Eden,
[1:02:41] but he comes to Adam's garden.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; He doesn't just come to God's garden,
[1:02:51] but he comes to his son's garden.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Perhaps I can just give you this
[1:02:57] scripture, which we'll take and read
[1:03:00] later on, or at least I'll read it for
[1:03:02] you. in the Song of Solomon, which is a
[1:03:05] book of in incredible love and
[1:03:08] descriptions of of love
[1:03:12] and the and the bridegroom speaks
[1:03:15] and he speaks to his bride. He says that
[1:03:17] he calls her my sister, my spouse. And
[1:03:21] sister can be used also as bride. My
[1:03:24] sister, my spouse.
[1:03:26] Uh you are a garden.
[1:03:30] my sister, my spouse,
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; my beloved one, you are a garden. Why?
[1:03:35] Because that's where the bridegroom will
[1:03:38] place his seed.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; And he said, and and she even invites
[1:03:43] him, come into your garden.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; You have to have supernatural thinking
[1:03:49] now.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Come into come into your garden.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; And and uh and and and he smelt the myrr
[1:03:57] and the spices. It was a delightful. It
[1:04:00] was a place.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; It was a specific place. And so, Satan
[1:04:06] through the serpent came to the first
[1:04:09] Adam's garden and swed a polluted seed.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; And brought the fall.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; And then if you go over to the book of
[1:04:22] Revelation, you'll find a new creation,
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; another garden. Yes sir.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Another river planted
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; and in the midst of the garden is the
[1:04:33] tree of life.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; None other than Jesus Christ united once
[1:04:40] again with his bride.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; And he sent a messenger in this day to
[1:04:46] tell those that were called your blind
[1:04:48] womb is sealed.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; And he cannot sew his seed in your mind.
[1:04:56] He cannot distress the peace that I am
[1:04:59] bringing to you. You are called and I
[1:05:02] have sent a ministry that will actually
[1:05:05] unite you in a marriage.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; And as a heavenly parent,
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; that's why the old customs was the
[1:05:16] parent
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; would select a bride for his son.
[1:05:22] I say to you in all seriousness this
[1:05:24] morning,
[1:05:27] don't think too little of yourself when
[1:05:30] God could search the earth over
[1:05:34] and call you
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; and select you and say, "You will make
[1:05:42] up
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; the body that will be the wife of my
[1:05:47] son,
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; my beloved son.
[1:05:51] the one I'm so satisfied with. The son
[1:05:54] that's my rest. My life is wrapped up in
[1:05:57] my son and you will be his wife.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; That ought to do something for you.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; And Satan will not be able to creep
[1:06:09] under this new creation wall.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; The price has already been paid. And I
[1:06:20] came in a ministry of revealing the son
[1:06:23] of man, my son through Elijah.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; I came in that ministry
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; to unite
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; those that were elected in this end
[1:06:35] time. And as the prophet said, there
[1:06:38] will not be another one.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; There will not be another one. This
[1:06:46] ministry, it's not going to be married
[1:06:48] more than once. He's going to come and
[1:06:50] unite you to him, and you will be
[1:06:52] forever united with the groom.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Come hither, said the angel,
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; and I'll show you the lamb's wife.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be an old person. You
[1:07:04] don't have to be a mother, father. You
[1:07:06] don't even have to be a senior, you
[1:07:08] young people, to announce to you, you
[1:07:11] know, there's people being chosen today
[1:07:13] and we're having the Olympics in another
[1:07:16] uh few weeks here and uh I understand
[1:07:20] that I saw a picture in the newspaper of
[1:07:24] one of the young ladies and and it
[1:07:27] looked like she would stand on the
[1:07:29] podium and maybe have gold or silver or
[1:07:32] bronze. They were counting on her. She
[1:07:34] was Canada's uh uh she was Canada's, you
[1:07:39] know, lady to be the skier and and get
[1:07:45] gold.
[1:07:47] And here just in some lesser games and
[1:07:50] so on over in Italy, she injured her leg
[1:07:54] or broke her leg or something and it was
[1:07:56] all dashed and it just showed her wiping
[1:07:58] her tears because she'd been selected
[1:08:02] and to to stand in a place well nobody
[1:08:07] here I don't expect plans to stand on
[1:08:10] the Olympic stadium at the Olympic stand
[1:08:14] and that is a place of honor in the
[1:08:16] whole world and tens of millions of
[1:08:18] people will see it and it it is a place
[1:08:22] and I can tell you there'll be a feel
[1:08:24] there'll be a feeling of of fulfillment.
[1:08:28] There'll be a feeling of exhilaration.
[1:08:31] There'll be a feeling as though a person
[1:08:33] has achieved something. I worked my
[1:08:35] whole lifetime. This is why I got up at
[1:08:37] 3 in the morning and and and went to the
[1:08:40] hills and went to the jumps and went to
[1:08:42] whatever and just practiced and
[1:08:44] practiced and practiced. I ate right. I
[1:08:46] did this right. I did everything. So
[1:08:48] disciplined. So disciplined. They're not
[1:08:50] people my age or mothers and fathers.
[1:08:52] These are young people.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; But they're striving to stand on a
[1:08:56] certain podium.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; They're standing wanting to be selected
[1:09:00] for a certain place here in this world.
[1:09:03] And I tell you nothing that you have
[1:09:05] done but God Almighty who spoke from the
[1:09:08] heavens said this is my beloved son.
[1:09:12] carry him. And now he goes over the
[1:09:15] masses of humanity and and and by his
[1:09:18] predestination, he's going to choose
[1:09:20] certain ones and say, "You will be
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; my son's wife."
[1:09:26] [Applause]
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Tell you, my brother, my sister, that's
[1:09:31] nothing to look down on.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; That's a most glorious thing. That's not
[1:09:36] something for you to think about for an
[1:09:38] hour or two while brother Ed is
[1:09:39] preaching this morning. That's something
[1:09:41] you want to take out of this place and
[1:09:43] go home and build on it. Say, "I've been
[1:09:45] called. I've been chosen. I've been
[1:09:49] elected. I've been predestinated.
[1:09:52] God has ordained it." And that's why
[1:09:53] this message meant something to me.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; I say, "Blessed art thou.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Blessed are you people." Amen.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; I can't even tell you how blessed you
[1:10:08] are
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; and how privileged we are to walk with
[1:10:11] one another
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; and to shake each other's hand
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; and to look in each other's face and to
[1:10:18] sit in the same building.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; How privileged we are.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; The Bible says this just a little
[1:10:30] summary now tying it into last week.
[1:10:35] one one sat on the throne
[1:10:38] and he had a book
[1:10:42] in his right hand and was sealed.
[1:10:45] I'm I'm not straying from where I'm at.
[1:10:48] You'll just have to jump with me.
[1:10:51] And he has a book.
[1:10:54] That book is the book of life.
[1:10:57] It's the record of human life.
[1:11:02] When the lamb takes it, it becomes a
[1:11:04] lamb's book of life.
[1:11:07] So he reaches out and he claims it.
[1:11:09] You're in that book.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; You're a little segment of that book.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; You are an epistle
[1:11:16] written by God, as I said last week.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Known and read of all men. You are part
[1:11:22] of that book.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; And there was part in there that needed
[1:11:27] this Sabbath.
[1:11:29] This one who took all the penalty.
[1:11:33] this one who was Boaz
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; who was a mighty man of wealth
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; and he had in him the blood
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; that could atone for your sin
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; and he was going to take the book with
[1:11:48] full knowledge of who you are and what
[1:11:50] you are and what you've been and what
[1:11:52] you will be and he took that book
[1:11:54] without any hesitation said this is my
[1:11:57] book
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; in other words this is my people
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; more More than that, this is my lover.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; This is my bride. More than that, this
[1:12:06] is my garden.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going to sew my seed
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; in this garden.
[1:12:14] [Music]
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; And this will be a special place
[1:12:25] is a book of life
[1:12:27] and also would be known as a book of
[1:12:29] redemption.
[1:12:31] that's not written and described that
[1:12:33] way in the scripture. But it took
[1:12:35] Elijah, the spirit of Elijah to come and
[1:12:38] in the end time as he's approaching now,
[1:12:41] he's already been met by seven angels.
[1:12:44] And he's now going to uh expose or
[1:12:48] reveal to the people what they said. And
[1:12:51] in preparation for the opening of the
[1:12:53] seals, in preparation for unfolding and
[1:12:58] revealing some things about you.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; And before he did that, he had to lay
[1:13:07] the foundation for it. So he's he goes
[1:13:10] to Revelation the 5th chapter said
[1:13:12] there's one on the throne,
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; the oneness,
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; only one God.
[1:13:20] And there's one on the throne and he's
[1:13:22] got in his hand a book.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; It's written and it's sealed with seven
[1:13:27] seals.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; And once the lamb rose, there was no one
[1:13:34] able to take the book and John wept.
[1:13:38] And the angel that was speaking to John
[1:13:40] said, "Weep not. The lion of the tribe
[1:13:42] of Judah has prevailed to loose the
[1:13:45] seals thereof."
[1:13:48] and he looked and he saw a lamb
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; and the lamb rose.
[1:13:53] The lamb was standing, not sitting. The
[1:13:56] lamb rose
[1:13:58] and took the book. In other words, when
[1:14:01] he took the book, he claimed it
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; and it became the book of redemption.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; And it took a prophet to uncover and
[1:14:11] reveal that the first Adam lost it all
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; in the garden. He lost everything. But
[1:14:17] the second Adam is buying everything
[1:14:19] back. Redeem, buy back what was lost.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; And through Adam and the sexual birth,
[1:14:27] we lost it all also. But through the
[1:14:30] virgin birth and through the kinsman
[1:14:33] redeemer, we gained it all back.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; And there is a place in Christ, in him.
[1:14:42] There is a place an actual place that we
[1:14:46] can come to
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; that is a place of rest. Amen.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; If you had distress today because of
[1:14:54] some something physical
[1:14:59] in the body,
[1:15:01] and I know even just recently there has
[1:15:04] been some,
[1:15:06] physical things.
[1:15:09] And we're so happy
[1:15:12] that this kinsman
[1:15:15] fixed it.
[1:15:17] Our
[1:15:20] sister Karen Ashdown. She here this
[1:15:22] morning. I don't think she's here.
[1:15:28] They're very,
[1:15:29] she'll forgive me. We know her like a
[1:15:32] daughter,
[1:15:34] but she's had biopsies for several
[1:15:36] months now,
[1:15:38] and they want to know if some growths,
[1:15:40] four large growths were cancerous.
[1:15:46] and she just got the results this last
[1:15:49] week that none of them none of them
[1:15:53] there's no cancer cells
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; I say glory be to God
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; unknown to the congregation we've been
[1:16:00] praying and we've been believing but I
[1:16:04] want to say now it's done
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; hallelujah and it was done 2 years ago
[1:16:09] but it's done this kinsman when he
[1:16:12] bought it back
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; he bought back that healing
[1:16:18] It is Satan.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; The devil.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "You may call it
[1:16:23] cancer, but it's a devil."
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; And you can sit here maybe healthy this
[1:16:27] morning and not feel badly about it, but
[1:16:30] how thankful we are. We have a healer in
[1:16:33] our kinsman redeemer.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; I say, "Glory be to God."
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Let's thank him.
[1:16:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; We give you glory.
[1:16:51] [Music]
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; I can assure you
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; if sickness came upon you or into your
[1:16:59] home or your husband, your wife, or your
[1:17:00] children or your parents,
[1:17:03] you'd be so urgent.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I know there's an answer. I know
[1:17:09] that you paid for it. Well, when we're
[1:17:11] not in directly in need, let us be
[1:17:14] filled with thanksgiving even in that
[1:17:16] time.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I see Brother Toby
[1:17:23] clapping his hands. He has good reason
[1:17:25] to clap his hands. His his baby infant.
[1:17:28] They said something was wrong with this
[1:17:30] infant, a serious ailment. And brought
[1:17:33] her into the office and we prayed and
[1:17:35] took her back and she's completely 100%
[1:17:38] normal.
[1:17:40] Hallelujah.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Our God is real.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; This a kinsman redeemer.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; He took the book
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; and claimed it.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; I want to say to you, you are claimed.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; You have been bought.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; We are not our own.
[1:18:01] [Applause]
[1:18:03] And in order to interpret this fifth
[1:18:05] chapter of Revelation, Brother Brandham
[1:18:08] goes back to one place
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; to the book of Ruth.
[1:18:21] her own. And when he took the book,
[1:18:24] there were shoutings and rejoicings,
[1:18:26] thou art worthy.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham goes to one place
[1:18:33] and he goes back to the book of Ruth
[1:18:35] because she needed to be redeemed.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; And there was only one, a mighty man of
[1:18:40] wealth.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; And the prophet draws him out and says,
[1:18:44] "Boaz,
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; the kinsman redeemer." And the Bible
[1:18:48] says, "So Boaz took Ruth.
[1:18:52] What did he do? He claimed her.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; He claimed her. You'll be mine.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; She was his garden.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; And when he swed his seed in her, there
[1:19:06] was rejoicing.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Before that, before the child was even
[1:19:10] born,
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; before there was anything visible, may
[1:19:14] he be great.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; And you were swed with seed.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; And that's the mystery. That's the
[1:19:20] mystery of the book of redemption.
[1:19:23] You've been swed with seed. And when the
[1:19:25] angels in heaven and the 420 elders saw
[1:19:28] what was happening, oh, I hope you can
[1:19:30] see what I've seen. There was rejoicing.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; They rejoiced because they knew that the
[1:19:38] seed that had been sown would be great.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; And they said, "You're worthy to take
[1:19:44] this boy. You're worthy to take this
[1:19:47] woman. You're worthy to take this bride
[1:19:50] and sew your seed in her.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; This is your garden.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; And you've been chosen.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to make you feel good.
[1:20:05] You're the one that's sitting here.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; And if I asked you, why are you sitting
[1:20:08] here? You'd say, I heard a message.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; I heard a voice.
[1:20:14] And by virtue of that, I say on the
[1:20:16] basis of you hearing it, on the basis of
[1:20:19] you sitting here, God is declaring
[1:20:22] you've been called.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; You've been called not to a marriage.
[1:20:26] You've been called and are married.
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:43] This book is a complete book, a complete
[1:20:46] record of life.
[1:20:48] It is the mystery of God's plan.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; To reveal revealing
[1:20:55] redemption.
[1:20:57] And so Boaz,
[1:20:59] who the prophet takes to unfold to us,
[1:21:02] so we can take back and read it and look
[1:21:04] at it. And so Boaz took Ruth
[1:21:08] and the Bible says, "And she became his
[1:21:11] wife."
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; And when she when he went into her, the
[1:21:16] Lord gave her conception.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm going to be speaking very
[1:21:22] very bluntly to adults.
[1:21:25] When the prophet messenger came, we have
[1:21:28] a physical man called William Brham, but
[1:21:31] in another dimension, in another realm,
[1:21:34] which he spoke very much about. He said,
[1:21:37] "I'm in two worlds. I'm in another
[1:21:39] world." He said, and he even talked
[1:21:41] about how he would how he would uh uh
[1:21:46] obtain access into that world, passing
[1:21:49] it off for us to letting us know by
[1:21:52] believing. We can come to a place of
[1:21:55] divine rest. We can come to a place the
[1:21:59] price has been paid. Everything is
[1:22:01] settled. The joy bells are ringing. The
[1:22:04] victory, the war is over. The victory's
[1:22:07] been won. Hallelujah. And there's no
[1:22:10] reason for the bride of Jesus Christ not
[1:22:12] to be filled with joy and rejoicing in
[1:22:15] the face of the darkest hour because as
[1:22:18] brother Joe Green said to me the other
[1:22:20] day, whichever way happens with mother,
[1:22:22] if she if she lives, she wins. If she
[1:22:25] dies, she wins. I said to my wife this
[1:22:28] morning, she said, "What does this new
[1:22:30] year hold for us?" I said, "Whatever it
[1:22:33] holds, we win."
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We win. Whatever it holds
[1:22:39] for you, you win
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; because you've been redeemed. Because
[1:22:45] you were part of the book
[1:22:48] and the lamb took the book.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Not someone else. Not some great man.
[1:22:53] Not some king. The king of kings. The
[1:22:56] lord of lords, the redeemer took the
[1:22:59] book.
[1:23:00] [Music]
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; And Boaz, the prophet is saying, Boaz is
[1:23:06] that perfect type. And Boaz took Ruth.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ took you
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; and Boaz went in unto her. And in this
[1:23:16] ministry, Jesus Christ went in unto you
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; and gave you conception
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; so that you could bring forth this great
[1:23:28] one,
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Again, here on earth.
[1:23:40] Oh friends,
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; I hope
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; what a glorious thing.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Just overcome.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; And the Lord gave her
[1:24:01] conception.
[1:24:03] and the Lord
[1:24:06] gave you conception.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; It wasn't really anything
[1:24:14] that Ruth did.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; It was everything that he did.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; So when Boaz took her, he was actually
[1:24:26] taking a segment.
[1:24:29] There was nothing written at that time.
[1:24:30] But he was taking a segment of this
[1:24:32] book.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; When the lamb took it, he took the whole
[1:24:37] book.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Every person,
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; But when Boaz took her, he just took a
[1:24:43] little portion of the book.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; And he claimed her.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; He was elected to claim her.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; She was before the foundation of the
[1:24:54] world his.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; She was his wife. She was his garden.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; And out of her would come the beauty.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Out of her would come Oed and Jesse.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; And out of Jesse would come David,
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; the beloved king.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a garden.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Came out of her.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; What a garden.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; What a place of beauty. What a place of
[1:25:19] power. What a glorious thing came out of
[1:25:22] her. Listen to me people that are
[1:25:25] sitting here and you that are streaming
[1:25:27] and those of you that are in Europe or
[1:25:29] in in New Zealand or in Switzerland or
[1:25:32] wherever Norway, wherever you are, he
[1:25:34] chose you. You are his garden.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; You are the place for his seed.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; And out of you comes, he came as the son
[1:25:43] of man and revealed himself. But you are
[1:25:45] the one to bring forth the fullness of
[1:25:47] that son of man.
[1:25:49] Amen.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; That is why I said the fullness that
[1:25:51] fillth all and all.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; You're not just a church goer.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; You're not just a bench warmer.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; You're not just someone who come to
[1:26:00] church two or three times a week. You
[1:26:02] are the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; You are his garden.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; You're the elected place for his scene.
[1:26:12] [Applause]
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; He already ordained it. You've been
[1:26:17] predestinated.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; We had a prophet
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; to come and confirm that
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; to come and establish that.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And then unless the people would
[1:26:28] disbelieve,
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; he would uh even the father himself in
[1:26:34] the pillar of fire would move in and
[1:26:36] begin to call the people out.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; So that he said now you can't believe
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; how can you believe? How can you
[1:26:44] disbelieve?
[1:26:46] when he comes and vindicates and proves
[1:26:48] it
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; like this.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; There is a place
[1:27:08] there's an old song
[1:27:11] and says this.
[1:27:14] There is a place of quiet rest.
[1:27:18] Near to the heart of God.
[1:27:21] A place where sin cannot molest.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Near to the heart of God.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus blessed redeemer
[1:27:32] sent from the heart of God. Hold us who
[1:27:35] wait before thee near to the heart of
[1:27:39] God.
[1:27:40] There is a place of comfort suite near
[1:27:43] to the heart of God. A place where our
[1:27:46] where we our savior meet
[1:27:49] near to the heart of God.
[1:27:52] There's a place of full release.
[1:27:56] Near to the heart of God. A place where
[1:27:58] all is joy and peace.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Near to the heart of God.
[1:28:03] Oh Jesus, blessed redeemer
[1:28:07] sent from the heart of God. Hold us who
[1:28:10] wait before thee. Hold us near to the
[1:28:14] heart of God.
[1:28:19] There is a place.
[1:28:22] And I said, Lord, help me.
[1:28:26] Help me today.
[1:28:29] I want the people to know this. Not just
[1:28:30] a sermon.
[1:28:33] There's people, this is all chopped up,
[1:28:35] but I hope it means I have some
[1:28:37] continuity with you.
[1:28:41] Today we live in a time when people are
[1:28:44] searching and they're going to and fro
[1:28:47] and hither and yawn and they're seeking
[1:28:50] out leaders, gurus,
[1:28:54] teachers,
[1:28:55] stress management, all kinds of
[1:28:59] counseling,
[1:29:00] all kinds of websites, all kinds of
[1:29:03] things so that you can find and discover
[1:29:08] an inner peace. find this inner peace
[1:29:11] and people are yearning for it. They're
[1:29:13] longing for it. They're hungering for
[1:29:15] it. And they lap up all of this stuff
[1:29:17] and and people are are, you know,
[1:29:20] saying, "If you'll come here and if
[1:29:22] you'll just do this, I have a system. I
[1:29:24] have developed something and it will I
[1:29:27] guarantee you'll come to an inner
[1:29:29] peace." Well, I guarantee you won't.
[1:29:38] Brother Brennham, you know what? This is
[1:29:40] too simple, but I'm going to give it to
[1:29:42] you anyway.
[1:29:44] I have been so
[1:29:47] intrigued is not the word. Captivated is
[1:29:50] not the word. Completely
[1:29:53] consumed is not the word. There is no
[1:29:55] word
[1:29:56] for me to describe how
[1:30:00] involved I become when I hear the
[1:30:04] prophet being able and start calling
[1:30:08] people. And just as in the simplicity
[1:30:10] saying there's a there's that light. Do
[1:30:12] you see that light? He asked the people
[1:30:14] do you see the light? In other words, he
[1:30:16] believes that they should and maybe some
[1:30:18] did. That light is over this woman or
[1:30:21] this light is over this man.
[1:30:24] And and I'll tell you how you feel right
[1:30:26] now. You feel a real warm feeling.
[1:30:30] And I can tell you're a Christian
[1:30:32] because perhaps at sometime I'm just
[1:30:35] going all over the message now. I feel
[1:30:36] these vibrations coming and people
[1:30:38] wouldn't understand when he was talking
[1:30:40] about vibrations.
[1:30:43] Brother Brandham talked in a language
[1:30:46] that few people could understand because
[1:30:48] it was 40 years ago.
[1:30:52] And back then I'm going to read what the
[1:30:53] world was when he was talking about the
[1:30:56] waves coming through.
[1:30:58] And he it before a group of people and
[1:31:00] he said now there's cold waves coming
[1:31:03] through wave upon wave of skeptics.
[1:31:08] And then he'd say the next time now
[1:31:10] there's waves coming through. There's
[1:31:11] vibrations coming through. A welcome
[1:31:14] spirit. You are a Christian and you are
[1:31:17] welcoming him. And now I can tell you,
[1:31:20] you begin to feel real warm and all
[1:31:24] over.
[1:31:27] Brother Brand would say, "You don't
[1:31:29] understand. The people don't understand.
[1:31:31] But right now, I'm standing in two
[1:31:33] worlds."
[1:31:36] And he's telling what the pe he's
[1:31:38] telling to the people in this world what
[1:31:40] he's seeing in another world.
[1:31:43] So now it is it's something real for
[1:31:45] friends. It's not imagination. It's not
[1:31:48] just getting off and doing some yoga
[1:31:51] what they're seeking. It's not just
[1:31:53] going and sitting. It's not going to
[1:31:55] some eastern country to India or
[1:31:56] Thailand or some place to try to get it.
[1:32:00] And he he said it over and over again.
[1:32:02] And he said, I can prove to you he is
[1:32:04] here.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; I can prove to you he that came out of
[1:32:07] the tomb and was resurrected that he's
[1:32:09] right with us now. And I can say on the
[1:32:12] authority of what he said as the
[1:32:14] disciples followed Jesus Christ. I'm a
[1:32:17] disciple of this message.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; And they they perhaps couldn't do
[1:32:21] everything and couldn't perform
[1:32:22] everything that Jesus did. Many of them
[1:32:24] perhaps didn't have miracles or whatever
[1:32:26] more, but they believed he was the son
[1:32:29] of God. They believed that he died. They
[1:32:31] believe that he rose again. I believe it
[1:32:34] too. Do you? I believe that that same
[1:32:36] son of man sent this minister, sent this
[1:32:39] man of God, sent this spirit of Elijah.
[1:32:42] I believe that, don't you?
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; And by believing it, you are you are the
[1:32:46] recipient.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; You are elected
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; to believe it.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; And deny every every cold wave that
[1:32:55] comes in, tries to say, "Well, you're
[1:32:57] not worthy." Or we're not we're not
[1:33:00] talking about worthiness.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're talking about what God
[1:33:04] has said.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; And you heard the word. You heard the
[1:33:08] message. You were attracted to it.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Can you believe that's the greatest
[1:33:13] thing that could happen? It is even that
[1:33:16] in itself is uniting you with the
[1:33:17] bridegroom.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; That is uniting. Brother Brandon said
[1:33:23] the son of man, the Jesus Christ will
[1:33:26] come right through this right through
[1:33:28] this ministry. He'll come right through
[1:33:30] the ministry. And he did come right
[1:33:32] through the ministry. It wasn't it
[1:33:34] wasn't William Brandham coming through
[1:33:36] it. It was Jesus Christ coming through
[1:33:38] it.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; And he'll come right through this and
[1:33:41] unite the bride with the groom.
[1:33:45] [Applause]
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; That was the glue.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; That ministry was the it was the contact
[1:33:52] cement.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; You cannot pull away from it.
[1:33:58] Right.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; But when I hear him
[1:34:02] and he begins to tell the people
[1:34:08] and I remember my heart being revealed.
[1:34:12] I thought, "Oh my,
[1:34:14] oh my."
[1:34:16] And I hear it has never never lost its
[1:34:20] effect.
[1:34:21] I'm affected perhaps even more now than
[1:34:24] I was so many years ago.
[1:34:28] that same
[1:34:30] one.
[1:34:32] And I say, Jesus,
[1:34:36] you came
[1:34:37] and you used this vessel
[1:34:40] to get a hold of my heart and get a hold
[1:34:42] of others hearts and allow us to walk
[1:34:45] together. You came
[1:34:47] the son of man using this son of man who
[1:34:51] was so completely given over and now
[1:34:54] brother Brandon makes it. Stay with me.
[1:34:58] He said now he was trying to explain
[1:35:00] things and he got into trouble by
[1:35:02] explaining things, but he would say
[1:35:04] this. He'd say,
[1:35:07] cuz people were wondering, he'd say,
[1:35:11] "Two and two makes four. Two and two
[1:35:14] makes four. Two and two makes four. Two
[1:35:16] and two makes four. Two and two makes
[1:35:17] four." Or he said he might pick another
[1:35:20] number. You may not understand this. I'm
[1:35:23] not trying to get you to understand it.
[1:35:25] I'm trying to get you to understand
[1:35:26] where he where it got him.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; And he physically, of course, he was
[1:35:33] ordained to it, but let's not stop
[1:35:35] there. He would physically move
[1:35:39] to a place standing between two worlds
[1:35:43] and bring he didn't bring consternation
[1:35:47] to the people. He didn't bring
[1:35:48] despondency to the people. very seldom.
[1:35:51] Only once that I know of in South
[1:35:53] Africa, he said to a woman that came up
[1:35:56] and he said, "I see a I see a funeral
[1:36:00] procession
[1:36:02] and it's yours."
[1:36:05] She was a white woman
[1:36:07] and she was,
[1:36:10] shall I say, she was disturbed and upset
[1:36:15] that all these other people are
[1:36:17] receiving such wonderful things. And now
[1:36:19] she's been told and Brother Brandham
[1:36:22] told her, "As far as God is concerned,
[1:36:24] it's already happened."
[1:36:26] And she walked off in a bit of a huff.
[1:36:30] And Brother Brandham said, "A short time
[1:36:33] later, there was a bit of a commotion
[1:36:36] and she had all passed away in the
[1:36:38] meeting."
[1:36:45] Two and two is four. Two and two is
[1:36:47] four. two and two is four. Two. What's
[1:36:50] he saying? He gets his thoughts in his
[1:36:53] mind. You can't have a mind that's full
[1:36:56] of your studies and full of your job and
[1:36:59] full of your debts and full of
[1:37:01] everything else and just stuffed right
[1:37:03] out and what are we going to do and this
[1:37:05] that and all of these things. You can't
[1:37:06] have that. You got to say, "Oh, Holy
[1:37:09] Spirit turns that all out."
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; When it comes time to pay a bill, just
[1:37:14] pay it. or when it comes time to have
[1:37:16] another job, just do it. But but we we
[1:37:19] cannot succumb and become overwhelmed
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; with all the burdens of life and these
[1:37:26] things of life. We cannot friends, we
[1:37:29] cannot
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; our bridegroom,
[1:37:35] I don't know how to convey this. He of
[1:37:38] whom I speak is here. Amen.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; He of whom I speak is the one that's
[1:37:45] speaking to you.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Not even through these lips, but he of
[1:37:48] whom I speak, there's a still small
[1:37:50] voice.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; And you've heard it
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; and it has told you,
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; draw nearer.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Less of this
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; and more of him.
[1:38:05] less of all of these things
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; that clutter
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; and distract us and drag us down.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Less and less of this and more of him.
[1:38:16] Don't worry, you won't become too
[1:38:18] spiritual.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; What am I saying? Do you know why the
[1:38:25] message came
[1:38:30] about two years ago? I was with brother
[1:38:32] Lonnie Jenkins, brother Jeff Jenkins in
[1:38:34] his church and it came so real that the
[1:38:38] rapture before it's a before it's an
[1:38:41] actual location that you will go to
[1:38:44] it will be a place
[1:38:47] that you will enter into right here.
[1:38:51] Amen.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus stood right here
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Even the son of man," you
[1:38:58] know where it is, John the 3r chapter, I
[1:39:00] think about the 12th verse,
[1:39:02] "He that ascended up is the same that
[1:39:04] descended." And and he said, "And even
[1:39:08] the son of man which is in heaven
[1:39:11] standing right there." Brother Brandham
[1:39:14] said, "That would take an inoculation."
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham understood that.
[1:39:21] There is a place.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; And you might say, "Well, brother Ed,
[1:39:26] why don't you make it more clear?" Well,
[1:39:29] I'll tell you why.
[1:39:31] I'm also seeking it.
[1:39:36] I am conveying to you my
[1:39:40] desire, my anticipation,
[1:39:45] what I long for,
[1:39:47] what I intend to move towards.
[1:39:52] And I simply want to announce to you,
[1:39:54] there is a place.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; I can see it all through the scripture.
[1:40:01] I could go right back to I could go
[1:40:03] right back to Genesis into Eden right
[1:40:05] now.
[1:40:09] The serpent didn't launch Eve into
[1:40:13] space.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; she's right there.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; But she certainly she certainly was
[1:40:20] transported to another place.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; A place of pain,
[1:40:26] a place where she'd experienced death.
[1:40:30] a very very very
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; very sad place.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; And the second Adam came to take you out
[1:40:40] of this place
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; to another place
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; and that place is not some pie in the
[1:40:47] sky. That place is not something that's
[1:40:49] remote and far removed from you. that
[1:40:52] place is close to you as close as your
[1:40:55] breath
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; because that is why he came with the
[1:40:58] scripture. For the word of God is quick
[1:41:00] and powerful and sharper than any
[1:41:02] two-edged sword, piercing even the
[1:41:04] dividing of sunder of soul and spirit
[1:41:05] and of the joints and marrow and is a
[1:41:07] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:41:09] your heart. I want to say to this
[1:41:11] congregation,
[1:41:14] and you know what I'm saying is the
[1:41:16] truth.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; And you know what I'm saying? God has
[1:41:20] already witnessed to your heart.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; God has another place for me. God has
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; not just something, you know,
[1:41:29] slightly better or where he wants to
[1:41:32] touch me where I just get blessed today
[1:41:35] and go home and say, "Was a wonderful
[1:41:37] service." I don't care whether you say
[1:41:39] it's a wonderful service or what it is,
[1:41:41] but you'll go home and just have that
[1:41:44] one thing just
[1:41:48] anchored.
[1:41:51] And if you don't find it tomorrow or
[1:41:53] tomorrow night or next week, you go and
[1:41:56] say, "Not brother Ed said it, but you
[1:41:59] sent a messenger
[1:42:02] to say and what brother Ben Brandham
[1:42:03] said a multitude of times." And he
[1:42:06] quotes John 14. I go to prepare a place
[1:42:09] for you.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; That where I am, not where I will be,
[1:42:17] but where I am.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; And he stood right here on this earth
[1:42:20] and said, even the son of man which is
[1:42:23] in heaven.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; You might say, brother Ed, are you doing
[1:42:25] away with a physical place? Not at all.
[1:42:27] But I'm saying the way to get there is
[1:42:29] by something that happens here.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:35] Hallelujah.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; I personally think that if we were just
[1:42:42] to continue, we can't just be you can't
[1:42:46] just be, you know, have a nice little
[1:42:48] home and a family. You can't just have a
[1:42:50] social
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Fellowship.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; We're not getting there on social
[1:42:57] fellowship.
[1:42:58] We're getting there by the revelation of
[1:43:01] God's word to your individual heart
[1:43:03] where you can say, "I see it.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; I receive it."
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; And even if you don't see it, say, "I
[1:43:10] receive it.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; I accept it. I acknowledge it. There is
[1:43:14] a place for me.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; And by God's grace, I shall move into
[1:43:20] that realm." Brother Brandham calls it a
[1:43:22] sphere. He calls it realms. He calls it
[1:43:25] dimensions.
[1:43:28] Glory.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Think of this.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; I came across where
[1:43:40] I thought I I'd like to find out where
[1:43:42] brother Brandham first makes reference
[1:43:44] because he speaks about the television
[1:43:46] and the waves
[1:43:49] and the radio waves and he said the
[1:43:51] crystals or whatever you call it.
[1:43:55] I thought, when did Brother Brandham
[1:43:56] start talking about television?
[1:43:59] It was even in the 50s before it even
[1:44:01] reached our town. And the people were so
[1:44:04] ignorant, they didn't even know how to
[1:44:06] plug it into the wall to get it started.
[1:44:14] I had a friend who was he had the he had
[1:44:17] the job of going and and plugging in
[1:44:19] getting getting the pattern on cuz a
[1:44:22] certain hour it was going to come on in
[1:44:24] our town.
[1:44:26] And when it came on here's all this just
[1:44:29] nothing but snow.
[1:44:33] And he'd come out and I said, "Well, how
[1:44:35] was it?" He said, "It's just amazing."
[1:44:37] He said, "People the front room are full
[1:44:40] of people. The whole family's gathered
[1:44:42] and all just staring at that screen with
[1:44:44] all that snow, not seeing anything.
[1:44:46] Think this is the most amazing thing.
[1:44:51] Say simple people. Well,
[1:44:54] when brother Brandham first started to
[1:44:56] talk about the waves in the television,
[1:44:59] trying to describe what it was that he
[1:45:01] was conveying to the people where he was
[1:45:05] and how it was and how it so he tried to
[1:45:08] describe it for them when he was talking
[1:45:11] for the first time about the television
[1:45:13] waves. A car cost $1,800.
[1:45:19] Some of you people pay rent for that
[1:45:21] much
[1:45:23] or payment, mortgage payment. A car was
[1:45:26] $1,800.
[1:45:28] Gasoline was 27 cents a gallon.
[1:45:32] A house cost 16,000.
[1:45:35] Bread was 16 cents a loaf.
[1:45:39] Milk was 92 cents a gallon.
[1:45:42] Postage stamp was 3 cents.
[1:45:46] The stock market was $269.
[1:45:50] The average annual salary was $4,200
[1:45:54] for the year. And the minimum wage was
[1:45:57] 75 cents an hour.
[1:46:00] And in that environment, here's a man
[1:46:02] standing. Waves are coming through.
[1:46:07] Hey, the people just got,
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; how are they going to understand that?
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; He's a prophet. Amen.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a pleasant. He's not in
[1:46:18] this world. He's talking about another
[1:46:20] world
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; where these things are real.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; And he told them plainly, "Pictures are
[1:46:26] going through and bodies are going
[1:46:28] through and colors are going through the
[1:46:30] room. You think they could understand
[1:46:32] that?" Listen friends, if I could say it
[1:46:34] to you, that's a real world more real
[1:46:37] than the one you're sitting in.
[1:46:43] That's the vessel
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; who told you.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; You've been united.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; You've been actually selected by the
[1:46:53] parent, by the father.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; You've been selected by the father
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; to be a wife
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; to his son
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; who had said, "You are my beloved son."
[1:47:08] Think of what he faced of his wife.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Your beloved woman.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; You were selected not to be carpenters
[1:47:20] or plumbers or mechanics
[1:47:23] or just housewives even that. All of
[1:47:25] those are ministry. But you've been
[1:47:26] selected.
[1:47:29] I'd love to go down shake everyone your
[1:47:31] hand and tell you you've been selected
[1:47:33] to carry seed.
[1:47:36] Amen.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; You are his garden.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; And that is why when he took the book
[1:47:50] when he was taking you
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; the four and 20 elders, they couldn't
[1:47:54] hold their seat any longer.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; They had to leap to their feet and stand
[1:47:58] up and give glory to God and said,
[1:48:00] "Worthy art thou?
[1:48:02] Amen.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Worthy art thou to take this book? And
[1:48:06] when Boaz took her, they said, Worthy
[1:48:08] art thou, and may she be a fruitful bow
[1:48:11] to you. May she be a fruitful one and
[1:48:14] bring forth, and may she be greater than
[1:48:17] those that came before.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; There's bigger churches and more
[1:48:24] glamorous things. But I say in whatever
[1:48:27] days and time and years or month that
[1:48:29] months that God gives us,
[1:48:32] may God
[1:48:36] pour out
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; first
[1:48:40] an illumination
[1:48:43] that you can grasp.
[1:48:45] I've been chosen.
[1:48:48] May the depth of that come upon you. May
[1:48:50] it not be some just some words out of
[1:48:52] Brother Biscllow's mouth.
[1:48:57] You should say it to yourself, even if
[1:48:59] you say it quietly.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; I've been chosen.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; I've actually been chosen by the creator
[1:49:08] of heavens and earth.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Look up at the stars tonight. It's a
[1:49:12] clear night. Look up at the stars and
[1:49:14] say, "He who cast all those and spread
[1:49:19] them throughout the heavens,
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; you have chosen me.
[1:49:24] Oh my father, the creator of heavens and
[1:49:26] earth, you've chosen me.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; You've put me here as one little speck
[1:49:32] of dust on this earth. But in this speck
[1:49:34] of dust,
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; if you had a cell of your body, you
[1:49:38] wouldn't even be able to see it with
[1:49:39] this eye. But that cell has the color of
[1:49:42] your hair, every part of your nature,
[1:49:44] your DNA. Think what God, the creator,
[1:49:47] did when he put you here as a cell of
[1:49:50] his wife's body. Amen.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; I have many pages, but I'm not going to
[1:50:04] tire you.
[1:50:06] I just want to go home myself
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; and let this all soak in. Amen.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; I've been so
[1:50:16] help me and forgive me, but I've been so
[1:50:20] in wonderment about it. And I passed it
[1:50:23] by my wife and I tried to talk to her
[1:50:25] about the garden and
[1:50:27] and I could see it from Genesis all the
[1:50:30] way to Revelation. I could see it.
[1:50:33] I could see it all tying together even
[1:50:36] to the point I can't even begin to bring
[1:50:38] all the places. But I'll just tell you,
[1:50:40] it is there.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; It's all through the scripture.
[1:50:48] You've been called by him.
[1:51:06] The mystery of this book of redemption,
[1:51:09] the mysterious part of it is and when it
[1:51:12] it becomes so mysterious and the word
[1:51:16] the word mysterious is the word mystery
[1:51:19] in the scripture
[1:51:22] would be the same as uh what do they
[1:51:26] call those things when they an
[1:51:28] initiation
[1:51:32] you go to maybe Princeton or Harvard or
[1:51:34] some university or some
[1:51:40] you actually enter
[1:51:43] you say I want to enter this certain
[1:51:46] field I want to enter
[1:51:49] I want to go to Princeton. I want to
[1:51:51] enter and be in the Marine Corps. I want
[1:51:54] to enter the armed services. No, I want
[1:51:57] to enter a certain class of it. I I want
[1:52:00] to enter into a into an officer's class.
[1:52:03] So when I come out, I'll be an officer.
[1:52:08] And in order to do this, you have to
[1:52:10] pass a certain
[1:52:12] tests.
[1:52:14] And then when you pass them, you get
[1:52:17] accepted.
[1:52:18] And then when you get accepted,
[1:52:21] you know, they have often an initiation.
[1:52:26] Some of the initiations have been very
[1:52:28] gross and men, I suppose, women too, but
[1:52:32] have even lost their lives in the
[1:52:34] initiation. They call initiation
[1:52:36] ceremony, don't they?
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; And and and and the more
[1:52:42] the more there's some very very secret
[1:52:45] God help me. Are you staying with me?
[1:52:46] Amen.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; There's some very very secret
[1:52:51] groups, a very very secret enclosed
[1:52:56] groups
[1:52:58] and you can't hardly penetrate them. I'm
[1:53:02] reading right now a book on the history
[1:53:04] of the Mossad
[1:53:07] which is the one of the most elite of
[1:53:10] secret services in the world.
[1:53:14] They are a secret service at the CIA
[1:53:18] in the United States. the Boss Boss in
[1:53:20] Africa,
[1:53:22] the French Secret Service, the M15 and
[1:53:25] M16 from Britain, the Russian Secret
[1:53:29] Service, the KBG.
[1:53:31] They all have
[1:53:34] admired and respected the MOSAD because
[1:53:38] it seems that they have such a unique
[1:53:40] way and they know things when no one
[1:53:42] else knows things.
[1:53:46] In this book, they tell them, I won't
[1:53:48] even begin to get into it, but most all
[1:53:51] of you know a Princess Diana of of
[1:53:54] England and was killed in that car crash
[1:53:57] out of in in Paris.
[1:54:01] The driver of that car happened to be
[1:54:04] the head of security of the Ritz Hotel,
[1:54:07] which was actually not an agent, but he
[1:54:10] was an informer to the Mosad. And they
[1:54:13] knew things about Princess Diana that
[1:54:16] none no one else knew, including the
[1:54:18] queen and all of her people.
[1:54:21] They're so they're so respected and
[1:54:24] admired. Yeah, they've had their they've
[1:54:26] had their flub ups. They've had their
[1:54:28] mistakes, but in there they're trying to
[1:54:31] get access
[1:54:33] to the Vatican
[1:54:37] and they're trying to find a way. And
[1:54:40] the pre the president and premier of of
[1:54:42] of of Israel is saying, "But but who can
[1:54:48] who can rally the people like the Pope
[1:54:52] can?" And they're fulfilling the
[1:54:55] scripture. They're looking on her
[1:54:59] as John admired
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; with admiration, with great admiration
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; at this power.
[1:55:07] And they also look upon her and say,
[1:55:10] "How can they keep their themselves so
[1:55:14] enclosed and so tight and so protected
[1:55:20] that even we, the most elite of the
[1:55:23] world, cannot penetrate
[1:55:26] into the inner sanctums of the Vatican
[1:55:30] and even express their desire right from
[1:55:32] the president on down and that no secret
[1:55:36] service." And then when finally some get
[1:55:38] into the maybe the outer outer court of
[1:55:41] it,
[1:55:43] they just are they they're moving for
[1:55:45] position. They're kind of, you know,
[1:55:48] jostling for position so they can get
[1:55:51] who can get the closest.
[1:55:54] I thought, "Oh my god." Things that the
[1:55:57] prophet of God said that I didn't even
[1:55:59] understand just began to go up into
[1:56:02] great big flames of light, begin to see
[1:56:04] exactly what he said. And here he's just
[1:56:06] preaching it across the pulpit to people
[1:56:08] and they haven't got a clue what he's
[1:56:10] saying. But he's talking maybe 40, 50
[1:56:12] years in the future. And you and I have
[1:56:15] been united to this kind of information,
[1:56:18] this kind of word, this kind of
[1:56:19] revelation. You've been invited to it. I
[1:56:22] wouldn't take that invitation lightly.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely incredible
[1:56:32] that this is what we've been called to.
[1:56:40] I'm going a little bit slow because I
[1:56:43] just had so much and it was kind of
[1:56:46] scattered in my mind.
[1:56:53] The mystery.
[1:57:02] And if this doesn't just sound right,
[1:57:05] you'll forgive me.
[1:57:07] But the real mystery of Eden
[1:57:12] was not the serpent seat in Eve's womb.
[1:57:16] But the mystery, the real mystery was
[1:57:19] that Adam took her. Brother Bram said he
[1:57:20] took her quickly.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; And he didn't take her and just hug her.
[1:57:25] He didn't take and just kiss her. He
[1:57:27] swed his seed in her because he knew
[1:57:28] that God could not destroy her
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; with his seed in her. And even though
[1:57:33] that was righteous Abel, it was Abel who
[1:57:35] was a type of Christ. And his was the
[1:57:38] first blood that was ever shed on the
[1:57:40] earth outside of an animal blood. But
[1:57:42] his was the first blood that was shed on
[1:57:44] the earth. Cain slew him, but God raised
[1:57:46] up another seed
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; and that seed remained forever. Yes.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; The real mystery
[1:57:55] when Boaz took Ruth and took her into
[1:57:57] the into the tent and and she conceived.
[1:58:02] No one knew that but God himself.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; That was the mystery of her conception.
[1:58:09] She was carrying a royal seed.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; She didn't know it. Boaz didn't know it.
[1:58:14] No one knew it. God knew it. She's
[1:58:17] carrying a royal seed in her womb. That
[1:58:20] was the mystery.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; When the Song of Solomon speaks of his
[1:58:26] sister, his spouse, his garden,
[1:58:29] he said the garden is enclosed.
[1:58:33] The garden is a sealed place.
[1:58:37] This garden is not available to anyone
[1:58:40] else.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:42] This bride is not available to anyone
[1:58:45] else.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; This bride is not available to any man's
[1:58:50] doctrine.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; This bride is an enclosed garden.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Just take it and digest that. Amen.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; And that is why when the prophet now
[1:59:08] who's ordained to bring it to us in this
[1:59:10] generation, that's why you can go and
[1:59:13] read it into breach now. And he calls it
[1:59:15] the mystery of redemption.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; If you just take redemption for, you
[1:59:20] know, for uh uh uh face value say, well,
[1:59:24] it's something that was lost. It was
[1:59:26] something that's bought back. We lost it
[1:59:28] with the first Adam. We gained it back
[1:59:30] with the second atom. That's fine.
[1:59:31] That's at face value. But it's greater
[1:59:33] than that. How did he redeem us?
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; He redeemed us by coming to us
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; in this ministry.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Listen, when brother Brandham was here,
[1:59:45] Brother Brandham said, "Who did she
[1:59:47] touch? Who did he touch?" I'm just going
[1:59:49] now to the first pull because that
[1:59:50] indicates exactly what was happening all
[1:59:52] through the ministry. Who did they
[1:59:54] touch? Not me.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; They're 30 feet, 40 feet, 50 feet from
[1:59:59] me. They touched him.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; They actually reached through. But now
[2:00:03] here was a man in this world able to see
[2:00:05] from another world to tell people who
[2:00:08] are in this world. You touched him in
[2:00:10] another world.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; You actually touched him
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; in another world. And here he is in this
[2:00:18] world. You talk about television.
[2:00:20] Television knows nothing about this.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Man's science knows nothing about this.
[2:00:26] This is God's science. Amen.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Had Elijah standing here
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; seeing both worlds
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; following a pillar of fire saying, "You
[2:00:37] touched him."
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; And that one that was with him was going
[2:00:44] to stay with him, was going to open and
[2:00:46] reveal to him what was sealed in the
[2:00:49] book. and then tell him, go down and
[2:00:51] tell them the mystery of redemption is
[2:00:54] that she's my wife and I have chosen her
[2:00:57] and she's married to me and I have sown
[2:01:00] her with seed.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; And maybe these things now mean
[2:01:05] something. That's why the prophet said,
[2:01:07] "You're a virgin bride.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; You're sowing with seed."
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; And that truly made you his. You're not
[2:01:17] his because you said some tears at an
[2:01:19] altar.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; You're not his just because you said
[2:01:22] some words of repentance. You're not his
[2:01:24] because of some experience you had down
[2:01:27] here. You're his because he did it.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; He made you in a certain way. He made
[2:01:33] you to be his wife. He made you so that
[2:01:35] you could receive his seed.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he knows even that seed
[2:01:40] can never come to judgment because he
[2:01:43] was judged for you.
[2:01:50] Hallelujah.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; The second Adam,
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; the second Adam.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, the lamb
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; and the book of redemption.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; I've got to go home and think this over
[2:02:11] the thing myself.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:14] Oh, it's just so wonderful.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; God bless you young people. I I I you
[2:02:23] might not think so, but I I sit at home
[2:02:25] and I worry about you.
[2:02:28] I worry about all the young people. I
[2:02:30] worry about the ones that are children.
[2:02:32] I think, "Oh, God, are they going to get
[2:02:34] anything out of this? Did you get
[2:02:36] something out of it?" Good.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; You kids get something out of it? Did it
[2:02:43] go over there?
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; I hope that some of it even came down
[2:02:46] here.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; It's all right, young man.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Good. God bless you.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; I want to sing a strange song. Uh, let's
[2:03:13] go on. Let's go on talking about this
[2:03:15] good old way.
[2:03:18] I need a musician. I need a singer. I
[2:03:20] need some help.
[2:03:23] I can sing it, but it might not be the
[2:03:25] right key.
[2:03:28] Brother Brand saying this over and over
[2:03:30] again. That's the way I feel today.
[2:03:32] We're starting maybe in a few days,
[2:03:35] another year. Let's go on. Let's go on.
[2:03:39] Hallelujah. carriers.
[2:03:42] Do you accept that today?
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Carriers, you've heard it. You've heard
[2:03:46] it. But I just want it to explode
[2:03:50] with illumination and light and a
[2:03:52] revelation that you go out from this
[2:03:55] place.
[2:03:57] Hallelujah.
[2:03:59] Hallelujah.
[2:04:04] So much better
[2:04:07] talking about this good old way. So much
[2:04:12] better
[2:04:14] talking about the Lord.
[2:04:17] So let's go on. Let's go on talking
[2:04:22] about this new way. Let's go on. Let's
[2:04:27] go on talking about the Lord.
[2:04:33] He don't like it.
[2:04:36] Talking about this good way.
[2:04:41] He don't like it
[2:04:43] talking about the Lord. Oh, so let's go
[2:04:48] on. Let's go on talking about this old
[2:04:53] way. Let's go on. Let's go on talking
[2:04:59] about the Lord.
[2:05:02] Feeling so much better.
[2:05:05] Talking about this new way. Feeling so
[2:05:10] much better.
[2:05:12] Talking about the Lord.
[2:05:15] So let's go on. Let's go on talking
[2:05:20] about this old way. Let's go on. Let's
[2:05:25] go on talking about the Lord. I'd like
[2:05:30] you to sing this chorus again. Feeling
[2:05:33] so much better. You turn around, shake
[2:05:35] hands with as many as you can. Feeling
[2:05:38] so much better,
[2:05:41] talking
[2:05:42] good old way. Feeling so much better
[2:05:48] talking about the Lord.
[2:05:51] Let's go on. Let's go on.
[2:05:55] talking about this way. Let's go on.
[2:06:00] Let's go on talking about
[2:06:06] feeling so much better.

[2:06:16] talking.
[2:06:20] Let's go on. Let's go on talking about
[2:06:25] this good old way. Let's go on. Let's go
[2:06:29] on talking about
[2:06:33] Let's make that a habit now. And I can
[2:06:37] guarantee you one thing. The devil, he
[2:06:40] don't like it
[2:06:42] talking about this good old way. The
[2:06:45] devil, he don't like it when talking
[2:06:50] about the Lord. Oh, so let's go on.
[2:06:54] Let's go on talking about this.
[2:07:00] Let's go on. Let's go on talking about
[2:07:04] the Lord.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Tom, you come and ask Brother
[2:07:13] Tom to pray God's blessings upon you and
[2:07:15] have a wonderful afternoon. And Lord
[2:07:17] willing, we'll see you Thursday evening,
[2:07:19] 9:00.
[2:07:22] Glory.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I feel good.
[2:07:25] Amen. In the presence of God. Let's
[2:07:28] thank him for the word we heard this
[2:07:29] morning. Heavenly Father, I'm so
[2:07:31] thankful to know, Lord, that we have a
[2:07:33] transportation,
[2:07:35] Lord. It's not on tracks. It's not by
[2:07:37] jet fuel, but Lord, it's by revelation.
[2:07:40] and you're moving us from glory and to
[2:07:42] glory unto glory until Lord, we come
[2:07:45] into that place rapture ready, ready to
[2:07:48] take on a new body. Lord, we just pray
[2:07:50] for more revelation that as you will
[2:07:53] inspire your ministry, our pastor. We
[2:07:56] pray God that that revelation will be
[2:07:58] our portion also that we could bring
[2:08:01] forth much fruit within our lives. That
[2:08:04] we could be called the garden of God.
[2:08:07] That we could bring forth Jesus Christ.
[2:08:09] What a privilege. What an honor it is,
[2:08:13] Lord God, that we can join our voices
[2:08:15] together with those throughout eternity.
[2:08:18] We've been redeemed by the blood of the
[2:08:21] lamb. Take your portion this morning.
[2:08:25] And may you receive all glory and honor.
[2:08:27] Go with your people. We pray now in
[2:08:29] Jesus name. Amen.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:08:38] service is over.
[2:08:40] Stay as long as you want for whatever
[2:08:43] you do. Walk in the fullness. Walk in
[2:08:46] this light. Don't don't let the devil
[2:08:49] put even a you know this is a womb of
[2:08:52] the for the Lord's seed. Just
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; let that conception just bring forth.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're dismissed in Jesus name.
[2:09:02] Have a wonderful afternoon. God bless
[2:09:04] you.
