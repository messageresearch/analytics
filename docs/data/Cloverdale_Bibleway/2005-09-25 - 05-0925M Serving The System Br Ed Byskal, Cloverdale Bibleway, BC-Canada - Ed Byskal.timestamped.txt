[9:13] [Music]
[9:23] Thank you Lord.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; Bless your name, oh God.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:42] Amen. God bless your choir. Thank you.
[9:45] [Music]
[9:48] Amen.
[9:52] You may have your seats
[10:02] with all that's been taking place in the
[10:07] over these last weeks.
[10:09] I know that uh I know that the devil
[10:12] fights
[10:14] and that's good because when he fights
[10:16] and we have victory.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was just wondering if there
[10:21] might be two or three of these young
[10:25] people, young men, young ladies that God
[10:28] has really done something of a unusual
[10:32] nature for. Just a complete deliverance.
[10:36] And then I know Satan comes in like a
[10:38] flood. And then I know that God raises
[10:41] up a standard against them. I just
[10:43] wonder if there's two or three that have
[10:46] had that experience in the last uh two,
[10:48] three weeks and want to jump up here and
[10:51] stand up here and and and just declare
[10:53] it before the congregation.
[10:56] I'm going to have a testimony or two. Is
[10:59] there somebody here that's had that?
[11:01] Don't be ashamed. Be real quick.
[11:06] I want to hear about your battle. I want
[11:07] to hear about your victory.
[11:10] &gt;&gt; And it'll be good for others. Maybe
[11:12] somebody today is in the middle of a
[11:13] battle and they need to hear about the
[11:15] victory.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; All right, David. Hallelujah.
[11:19] Bless you.
[11:20] &gt;&gt; Bless you.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; Well, um, we all know we're in a battle.
[11:25] Um,
[11:27] I just I just want to thank God. I mean,
[11:29] just standing here is uh is a miracle in
[11:32] itself. you know, as brother Ron Spencer
[11:36] said at the camp, right? We the revival
[11:40] has to start with us.
[11:42] So,
[11:43] um I I just come up here it is is just
[11:46] nothing's nothing is a is too little too
[11:49] big for God, you know, and standing here
[11:51] looking at everybody's face. I mean,
[11:53] Sam, my little brother, we've been
[11:54] through like a lot of battles. It might
[11:56] not be significant, but a lot of mind
[11:58] battles, a lot of outside influence and
[12:00] everything. And as uh I believe Stephen
[12:03] Camper said, the the you don't the heat
[12:07] of the devil doesn't come immediately,
[12:09] right? But slowly he bowls you up.
[12:11] Slowly he bowls you up and you don't
[12:12] know when you you end up uh just deep in
[12:16] sin. I'm not saying that I have I mean
[12:19] we sin every day. That's why we need the
[12:21] grace of God to pull us back up. You
[12:23] know, sometimes you you just get so beat
[12:25] down that you don't even feel like
[12:27] you're a Christian no more, right? So
[12:30] I'm I'm just here to just thank the Lord
[12:32] for all he's done, all the mind battles,
[12:34] all the influence, but now by his grace,
[12:36] I'm standing once again. So
[12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:44] Someone else.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; You don't have any battles, do you?
[12:51] Sister.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; All right. There you are. Well, actually
[12:56] um um a few months ago um I had um um
[13:00] went to the doctor. It was in the
[13:03] evening time and I um had some stomach
[13:05] cramps and um I went in to because I
[13:08] didn't want to I didn't want it to be
[13:09] something serious or something. So
[13:11] anyway, they took these X-rays and they
[13:13] said that um they saw that that I might
[13:16] have that they said that they saw what
[13:18] was on there was lymphoma, which is a
[13:20] lymph cancer. And it's sort of like my
[13:23] husband was like um
[13:26] really upset him and but I you know I
[13:29] just I don't know I just felt like
[13:31] everything was at peace like and so they
[13:33] actually said well we have to tell you
[13:35] what we saw on the x-rays
[13:38] and then they said but they wanted
[13:39] another person to look at it. So another
[13:42] um doctor looked at it and they said
[13:45] they said the same thing and then my
[13:48] husband got you know really worried and
[13:49] I was sort of like what if it is you
[13:52] know and I was thinking
[13:55] you know I just I just felt like
[13:57] wherever God wants me you know even if I
[14:00] was to go home I was just not worried or
[14:02] anything. And so, um, let's see. It's
[14:05] sort of more scary up here than after
[14:08] hearing those the reports of, you know,
[14:10] the doctor's reports. Anyway, then they
[14:13] said, um, for then they said for they
[14:16] wanted still my, um, my regular doctor
[14:19] to look at the, um, reports. So, um, I
[14:22] went to him a few days later after that
[14:24] and they then that that same doctor
[14:27] said, "Well, his first his first words
[14:29] were,"Well, you're sort of a mystery."
[14:32] And I said, 'I know. And then um he
[14:35] said, 'Well, what we're going to do, he
[14:36] said he really wasn't sure, but it did
[14:38] look like there was something there.
[14:41] They said it was actually sort of around
[14:42] my um
[14:45] um the aorta that comes down from the
[14:47] heart that there was some kind of
[14:49] something there that's where where often
[14:51] lymphoma is.
[14:53] And so, um, they said, well, he said,
[14:55] what I'm going to, what you can do is
[14:57] actually go in and they said, we can go
[14:59] in and, um, take some samples and, um,
[15:03] see if it's actually cancer or we can
[15:06] wait. And then I thought, that's what
[15:08] I'd like to do, just wait and wait on
[15:11] the Lord. And then he said after a few
[15:12] months to go back in again and um, have
[15:16] another CAT scan done. And so about two
[15:20] two months later or something, I went in
[15:22] again and had a CAT scan. And then the
[15:24] doctor called back and he said um he
[15:27] said that it had all shrunk and it was
[15:29] all gone.
[15:30] &gt;&gt; And so I was just praising the Lord and
[15:32] thanking
[15:39] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[15:41] &gt;&gt; We just had a phone call. were talking
[15:42] with some people uh yesterday and
[15:46] brother Billy Andrews who many of you
[15:48] know brother Billy Andrews they found a
[15:51] tumor on his brain and uh scheduled him
[15:55] for an operation and his wife just I
[15:58] don't know uh just how it came about. I
[16:03] hadn't spoken to uh Sister Andrews but
[16:06] she said to him, "You are healed."
[16:11] And so he they went in to operate and he
[16:14] said, "Just before you operate, I'd like
[16:16] you to do uh one more examination."
[16:19] And they examined him, did a CAT scan, I
[16:22] guess, and couldn't find it. It wasn't
[16:24] there.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. And he was already under the
[16:33] effects of it. He was already losing his
[16:35] memory and and all of these things.
[16:37] Well, God's the same, isn't he?
[16:40] &gt;&gt; Is there one more of the young All
[16:42] right, here we are. I knew there was one
[16:44] or two there hanging in.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; Well, I guess I better say it. Um, as
[16:52] many of you know, I was already allergic
[16:53] to bees and all that and like hornets
[16:56] and all that stuff. And I had a reaction
[16:58] like three like about a month ago and I
[17:02] said a testimony and everything. God
[17:03] really. And then Wednesday, um I guess
[17:07] the doctor told me that was it was
[17:09] really serious and I was going to have
[17:11] to go on this big two a year episode and
[17:14] I just wasn't really looking forward to
[17:15] that. And so brother John prayed with me
[17:19] and I asked brother John to ask the Lord
[17:22] just for his will because God has his
[17:26] will and you don't want to it's better
[17:28] just to go with his will, right? So
[17:30] anyways, um I I really wanted to be
[17:33] healed, but then I was like, you know
[17:34] what, just be neutral, whatever God
[17:36] wants. It could be character building,
[17:39] right? He he he always knows what's
[17:41] best. So, um, Brother John prayed and he
[17:43] just prayed that I would actually be
[17:45] healed. And the next day at work, um, I
[17:48] was just about to leave and then I got
[17:49] stung again right on the stomach. I was
[17:52] like, "No way. I can't believe I just
[17:54] got stung again." So anyways, I prayed
[17:57] right away. way. I just went to the
[17:58] clubhouse and prayed for about five
[17:59] minutes and then I took my medication
[18:03] just some pills just cuz you you know
[18:05] you don't want to be foolish. God uses
[18:07] doctors and medicine. So I did that and
[18:09] then I went to emergency and I waited
[18:12] for two hours and nothing happened.
[18:15] There was no no reaction nothing. The
[18:18] doctor the day before me, he told me
[18:20] that in about half an hour, he said,
[18:22] "You would have a really bad deathly
[18:24] reaction." And nothing was happening for
[18:26] about 2 hours. So I went and saw a
[18:28] doctor and he's like, "I don't know how
[18:29] to explain it." He says, "I guess you
[18:31] can go." Me and my mom are just like
[18:33] smiles like up to here. Like we know we
[18:35] we knew what it was.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; So I just wanted to say praise God. I
[18:40] guess I'm healed. So
[18:41] &gt;&gt; thank you, brother, for praying.
[18:48] Hallelujah.
[18:51] Amen.
[18:55] God bless you, brother Peter. Oh, God
[18:58] bless you.
[19:03] &gt;&gt; Well, I just want to thank everyone for
[19:05] their prayers. Um, I know right from the
[19:08] oldest person, Brother Alan King, to the
[19:10] young people at the doulies, I just felt
[19:13] um I guess there's one word to say
[19:15] saturated by prayer.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; And um there's no other way to explain
[19:20] it.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; I just uh right to the last minute, I
[19:24] thought they were going to tell me they
[19:25] made a big mistake because I didn't feel
[19:27] any like I was, you know, anything was
[19:30] wrong with me. So, uh I don't know. I
[19:33] guess it's still a same thing. I still I
[19:36] don't know what it was all for, but I
[19:37] know the Lord uh had his hand on the
[19:40] whole thing. And you know, I'm just so
[19:42] thankful,
[19:43] &gt;&gt; you know, I just thinking um you know,
[19:46] you you see a congregation and you know
[19:49] that they're praying for you and to me
[19:52] it's just an example of the ministry.
[19:56] And brother Random says, "We'll no go no
[19:58] higher than our pastor." And I think a
[20:00] bouquet goes to brother Ed for for the
[20:03] example and for, you know, for what I've
[20:06] gone through to know that people have
[20:08] been praying for me and it's just a a um
[20:12] direct response of our ministry.
[20:16] [Applause]
[20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:25] Well, I appreciate those kind words, but
[20:26] I tell you what, I think it's uh just
[20:29] the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[20:31] extended to us. We want to thank each
[20:33] one of you. Now,
[20:36] glad I have
[20:38] everyone's attention
[20:41] and wherever you are in the fellowship
[20:43] room, in the nursery. I'd like it all to
[20:46] fall quiet right now. I have a very
[20:49] important an announcement.
[20:54] I received an email this last week
[20:59] informing me that the entire library
[21:03] of Brother Brandham's sermons
[21:06] are now available
[21:08] for printing from your own personal
[21:11] computer.
[21:15] The email did not have
[21:18] uh or indicate its source
[21:21] or who sent it, but I have been on the
[21:25] website
[21:28] that they directed me to. And I can say
[21:31] this
[21:33] that this is probably
[21:36] without question one of the most
[21:37] remarkable things that has happened
[21:40] within the message since God brought it
[21:43] to us.
[21:45] There are several hundred messages that
[21:48] are not printed
[21:50] as of this date. There are several
[21:52] hundred of the 1100 and some messages
[21:55] that have never been printed.
[22:00] and some many of them are out of print.
[22:06] That has all changed as of today.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; As of this morning,
[22:13] &gt;&gt; I understand also for the first time in
[22:16] the history of the message that you can
[22:19] hear the voice
[22:22] while you read the book
[22:26] &gt;&gt; on the screen. So this morning before I
[22:29] came to church, I went in and I noticed
[22:34] after the title of the message, it had B
[22:39] for book
[22:42] or L for letter. This happens to be very
[22:47] important because there's countries such
[22:48] as China and Vietnam and so on where it'
[22:52] be important to have it. If you have it
[22:54] in book form, it's too formal and they
[22:57] regard that as a something that is could
[23:00] be illegal with the government. But this
[23:03] is like if it comes out in this form,
[23:06] they consider that for your own personal
[23:08] study. And so that is perfectly fine.
[23:12] And then it had B and then it had L and
[23:15] then it had MP3.
[23:17] And I clicked on the MP3
[23:20] on letting off the pressure and up came
[23:24] brother Brandham's voice preaching the
[23:26] message. And then I clicked on L and up
[23:30] came the message itself. And now I
[23:32] called my wife with tears coming in my
[23:35] eyes. I said come here. And I was
[23:38] reading the message and listening to it.
[23:41] And that's the way I love to study.
[23:45] And for the first time in history,
[23:47] you're able to do that.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; We are
[23:52] &gt;&gt; we are able
[23:55] we are now able to print messages that
[24:00] have been unavailable,
[24:02] have not been printed. And I have had
[24:06] many, many requests for messages that
[24:09] have been out of print for years. And
[24:11] they are now available. And we will be
[24:14] printing them for our congregation.
[24:17] [Applause]
[24:28] I understand that all that all the
[24:32] messages
[24:34] uh may not be uh available as of this
[24:38] moment but uh I do know that they are
[24:43] being uh being loaded every perhaps
[24:46] every day. I don't know. I they haven't
[24:49] informed me as of that but uh churches
[24:54] now
[24:55] anywhere in the world can print the
[24:58] message for their own people.
[25:02] Anything the pastor feels directed to do
[25:06] he will be able to make it available to
[25:08] the people and you can print it in your
[25:11] own home.
[25:13] This is the most remarkable announcement
[25:16] I've been able to make to this church
[25:18] along these lines because we we have not
[25:22] been able to make that kind of a a
[25:25] statement to you.
[25:27] Uh
[25:29] and I expect that
[25:32] you'll need to absorb these things. I've
[25:33] tried to give you the announcement as
[25:36] clearly as I could from the information
[25:38] that I received. There will be
[25:41] uh this is the announcement they sent
[25:43] out and it is the website is
[25:47] www.thefreeword.com
[25:53] www.thefreeword.com
[25:56] thefreeword.com.
[25:59] I'm glad for the freeword.com.
[26:03] You will find this posted on a number of
[26:06] places uh in the church. We just uh that
[26:11] was the one that they had sent. So, we
[26:13] printed four or five off and they'll be
[26:15] I think at the tithe box on the bulletin
[26:18] board, the bulletin board in the
[26:20] fellowship room. And so uh uh I've just
[26:25] got a number of the in the book form.
[26:27] These are just very unprofessional
[26:30] as far as being these are not glamorous.
[26:33] We're not interested in glamour. We're
[26:35] interested in getting the word. Uh if
[26:38] you tell me would I sooner have this
[26:40] today or something that was beautiful
[26:42] two years from now, forget the beauty.
[26:44] Just give me this, you know, just let me
[26:46] have my hands on it. And uh so I'm I'm I
[26:52] can't describe my uh happiness and
[26:55] enthusiasm about that. Brother Tony came
[26:59] and handed me this just in the study.
[27:02] Brother Tony, maybe you'd like to just
[27:03] say a word about it. Uh happy to have
[27:06] brother Tony and says Rebecca to back.
[27:14] This is the uh the third edition of the
[27:16] printing of the revelation of the seven
[27:18] seals in the Chinese language. And so
[27:21] the believers uh of course around the
[27:23] world that speak Chinese are very very
[27:25] happy for this. And it's uh just hot off
[27:27] the press. We just got it finished. And
[27:29] so having returned there from the body
[27:32] of believers in China, uh I was be a I
[27:35] was glad to be able to bring it back for
[27:36] us. And uh also uh brother Xiao Ala
[27:41] Santo
[27:43] our brother and sister have come back
[27:45] from China after many years as sister
[27:47] Tracy's mom and dad. So um welcome them
[27:50] also in the name of Lord Jesus Christ.
[27:55] Jesus name I press on. You can play
[27:57] that.
[28:01] Do we have the words to in Jesus name I
[28:05] press on?
[28:07] Okay. Could you help me with that,
[28:09] brother Rod?
[28:11] Let's just sing a a course or two as we
[28:13] stand and then I'm going to turn to the
[28:15] word right away. Thank you for your
[28:16] time.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:21] In Jesus name we press on.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; In Jesus name
[28:28] we press on.
[28:36] In
[28:37] Jesus name
[28:41] we press on
[28:44] and on
[28:47] dear Lord
[28:50] we
[28:54] clear
[28:56] before our eyes
[29:02] we find the strength.
[29:06] to press on once more. Shall we
[29:12] [Music]
[29:14] in Jesus name?
[29:18] We press on.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; We press on
[29:24] Lord
[29:26] in Jesus name.
[29:30] We press on
[29:34] and
[29:37] dear Lord
[29:39] with the prize
[29:44] here before our eyes.
[29:51] We find the strength
[29:55] to press on.
[29:59] with our heads bowed just before we turn
[30:01] to the word. Father, our Father, which
[30:06] art in heaven,
[30:08] hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come,
[30:10] and thy will be done on earth as it is
[30:13] in heaven. And we see that your will is
[30:15] being done. We desire earnestly to be a
[30:18] part of that. And we believe that you
[30:21] have called us for that specific
[30:23] purpose, that we can be a part of this
[30:26] great kingdom that is being established
[30:28] in the earth. Thank you Lord for
[30:30] bringing the brother Tony and sister
[30:31] Rebecca home safely and for all that are
[30:33] gathered here today. We pray that you
[30:36] will illuminate our minds with the
[30:39] special anointing of the Holy Spirit and
[30:41] may the word drop to the soul not merely
[30:44] to the ears Lord or to the mind but down
[30:47] to the soul. We pray that you'll bless
[30:50] this day oh God. Bless our brother John
[30:52] Andy's as he is prepared for tonight's
[30:54] service. And we pray Lord that this uh
[30:57] sanctuary will be filled to capacity as
[31:00] it is even now. And all that are
[31:02] listening and uh part of the family oh
[31:05] God that we feel united with. Pray that
[31:08] you'll bless them wherever they are in
[31:09] the world that are listening at this
[31:11] time. Every room, every place, oh God,
[31:14] in Jesus Christ's name. Anoint us with
[31:17] that special divine presence. In Jesus
[31:21] name we ask it. Amen. Amen. I want to
[31:24] read a few verses out of Romans, the
[31:27] first chapter.
[31:45] I'm starting at verse 21
[31:50] to verse 25.
[31:52] Because that when they knew God, they
[31:55] glorified him not as God.
[31:58] Neither were thankful, but became vain
[32:00] in their imaginations,
[32:03] and their foolish heart was darkened.
[32:05] Professing themselves to be wise, they
[32:08] became fools and changed the glory of
[32:11] the uncorruptible God into an image made
[32:14] like to corruptible man and to birds and
[32:18] to for-footed beasts and creeping
[32:21] things. Wherefore God also gave them to
[32:24] a up to uncleanness through the lust of
[32:27] their own hearts, to dishonor their own
[32:30] bodies between themselves. Notice verse
[32:33] 25, please. who changed the truth of God
[32:37] into a lie and worshiped and served the
[32:41] creature more than the creator who is
[32:45] blessed forever. Amen.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; May God bless his word to our hearts.
[32:50] You have your seats.
[32:55] I have a rather strange subject
[32:59] and I believe it will certainly apply to
[33:02] everyone at some level. It's one of
[33:05] those difficult subjects because it
[33:08] covers such a vast area. But I want to
[33:12] speak on serving the system.
[33:15] I told you I would be speaking on the
[33:17] system. So I want to take that from that
[33:20] direction. serving the system.
[33:23] In in verse 25, it said, "Who changed
[33:27] the truth of God into a lie and
[33:30] worshiped and served the creature more
[33:34] than the creator."
[33:38] You see, the only the only reason that
[33:40] the creature has to really exist is
[33:43] because of the creator.
[33:46] But if the creator
[33:49] and the life, the essence, the meaning
[33:53] of life, if it if it vacates, if it if
[33:57] it departs, then all you have really is
[34:00] a shell that's left and people end up
[34:04] serving this shell rather than the life
[34:08] that's supposed to be dwelling in it.
[34:10] Now I want to take the word served for
[34:13] example
[34:15] would mean to serve for hire
[34:18] either to the gods or men and used like
[34:23] uh uh as of slaves or free men or to
[34:26] render religious service or homage. I
[34:29] think of just quickly how many churches
[34:32] today are filled with people and many
[34:34] more people than we have here today and
[34:39] are actually serving the system
[34:42] &gt;&gt; rather than the one who's supposed to be
[34:45] dwelling in the system. I had a note
[34:48] given me. I had I passed it. I was
[34:51] decided not to read it. Now I've decided
[34:53] to read it. But there's a church in
[34:55] Houston. I understand non-denominational
[34:59] Lakewood Church. And I have nothing
[35:02] against Lakewood Church. I don't know. I
[35:04] don't know anybody there. Uh but they
[35:06] moved into a new location.
[35:09] Uh they spent $95 million in
[35:13] renovations,
[35:15] including two waterfalls
[35:17] and enough carpeting to cover nine
[35:20] football fields. And the arena is now
[35:23] the sanctuary of the church with a
[35:26] congregation of 30,000
[35:29] revenues of 55 million and last year
[35:33] last year rather and the television
[35:36] audience in the millions. Like many new
[35:38] evangelical churches, the building has
[35:40] no cross, no stained windows, no other
[35:45] religious icons. Instead, it has a cafe
[35:49] with wireless internet access,
[35:52] 32 video game kiosks, and a vault to
[35:57] store the offering.
[35:59] That's what's important. So, we have
[36:02] they asked us when we designed this
[36:04] church, do we want a little like a
[36:06] little coffee bar at where the stairs go
[36:10] up to the up to the balcony? I said, 'We
[36:14] certainly do not want a coffee bar.'
[36:17] Well, he said, "That's that's that's
[36:18] what everybody wants today in the
[36:20] church. As soon as you dismiss that,
[36:22] they're able to go out and have a a
[36:24] little coffee bar out there." Can you
[36:26] imagine? We say, "Well, folks, the
[36:28] meeting's over. Welcome to Starbucks
[36:31] that's in the foyer of the church. I
[36:34] thank God for the message that this is
[36:36] the way and the way evangelicals are
[36:39] going." Well, that's not the evangelical
[36:42] that I am
[36:43] &gt;&gt; or that we are or that you are.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; So, they served the system and it says
[36:50] to serve it like gods. Uh, and the
[36:54] creature is something that has been
[36:56] created. Now, I I just want to give a
[36:59] your a little understanding of the
[37:01] system. The system is an orderly
[37:04] combination or arrangement of parts or
[37:08] elements into a whole. That's the
[37:11] system. It is a orderly arrangement or a
[37:14] combination of parts or the elements.
[37:18] It's any methodical arrangement of
[37:20] parts. And in science, the system an
[37:24] orderly collection of logically uh
[37:27] related principles or facts or objects.
[37:31] It's any group of facts or phenomena
[37:35] regarded as constituting a natural whole
[37:38] and furnishing the basis and material of
[37:41] scientific investigation or construction
[37:45] as the solar system. Now
[37:49] God put the entire universe and we
[37:53] believe that into place.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; I don't care they want to call it the
[37:56] big bang. There might have been a big
[37:58] bang. I don't know. Nobody was back
[38:00] there. And all the people who talk about
[38:02] the big bang, they don't know. It's only
[38:04] an assumption on their basis. But
[38:06] however it happened, God did it.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God created the heaven
[38:11] and the earth. God did it.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; I don't care how he did it. And it's
[38:15] amazing to me how that uh men as as wise
[38:18] as they are and as intelligent as they
[38:20] are can miss the fact that, you know,
[38:23] they have to have a a a a prophet come
[38:25] with the wisdom of God. But they don't
[38:27] regard that. that and brother Brandham
[38:28] says many times that you know he had a
[38:30] seventh grade education but here I think
[38:33] God just he finds the world in their
[38:36] wisdom as being foolishness they can't
[38:38] even find the period after that first
[38:40] statement
[38:41] &gt;&gt; in the beginning God created a heaven
[38:43] and earth period
[38:45] &gt;&gt; and it doesn't know we don't know
[38:46] whether it's billions of years or
[38:48] trillions of years and we couldn't care
[38:49] less we don't care God did it and that's
[38:52] all we're concerned about and the
[38:54] scripture says in Psalms 147:4 For he
[38:58] tellth the number of the stars, he
[39:00] calleth them all by their names. In Job,
[39:04] he asked Job, "Test thou bind the sweet
[39:07] influences of Pleades or loose the bands
[39:10] of Orion? Can't thou find or cast thou
[39:14] bring forth Mazeroth in his season and
[39:17] that's a whole constellation of stars
[39:19] and they move." I think it has
[39:20] incredible significance how God has set
[39:23] the whole planetary system into such a
[39:27] uh such a distinct and precise order. He
[39:31] said, "Test thou guide Arcturus with his
[39:34] sons? Knowest thou the ordinances of
[39:36] heaven, and canst thou set the dominion
[39:39] thereof in the earth?" Can you do this,
[39:41] Job? And Job, of course, when you look
[39:44] up into the heavens and you see all that
[39:46] magnificent uh uh and and we're only
[39:48] seeing a small part of it, but
[39:50] regardless how far man can look into the
[39:53] distant universe, it just becomes more
[39:56] glorious and more marvelous and more
[39:58] intriguing and more wonderful because
[40:01] God did it.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; And there's no way that we're going to
[40:04] assimilate that in our minds. We just
[40:07] can't discover it. But then God also
[40:10] commanded the people, you will not
[40:12] worship these bodies, these heavenly
[40:14] bodies. You will not worship these stars
[40:17] because that was only the system.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; That was not the creator.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; And soon as you get rid of the creator
[40:26] and your mind is is void of him, then
[40:29] you're only worshiping the system
[40:32] anymore. And so he commanded them that
[40:34] they could not do that.
[40:37] Now we have so many systems I won't even
[40:40] be able to mention them all and neither
[40:42] do I want to get to them all but in the
[40:45] creation then when God turned his focus
[40:47] and began to create the uh order and the
[40:51] design and the evolution of the uh
[40:55] creatures that were on the earth and
[40:57] that's why I said here that they began
[40:59] to worship 4-footed beasts and all these
[41:01] things that's part of the system see
[41:04] that's not the creator but the people
[41:07] where when they turn away from God and
[41:10] they turn away from his his commandments
[41:13] then the worship is a part of the human
[41:16] structure and he's got to worship
[41:18] something. Brother Brham said he'll
[41:20] worship the sun, he'll worship the moon,
[41:22] he'll worship the stars, he'll worship
[41:24] Isaiah said he'll worship a stalk of
[41:26] wood.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; He'll just worship something. He's got
[41:29] to worship something. Uh I believe some
[41:31] people worship their dogs.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Well, they worship their car. They
[41:36] worship their job. They could worship
[41:38] their wife or husband or worship their
[41:40] children. Anything that comes between
[41:43] you and God becomes a god.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is. And a whole lot of
[41:48] people worship money.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Isn't that so?
[41:52] &gt;&gt; That happens to be just part of the
[41:54] system. And it's and it's because people
[41:58] don't recognize God and identified a
[42:01] masterpiece of God.
[42:04] Prophet said God the Holy Spirit
[42:06] brooding over the earth
[42:09] and the birds came out maybe and the
[42:12] animals different things and kept coming
[42:14] more in the form of the one that was
[42:17] brooding it more in the form of the one
[42:19] that was brooding until finally came up
[42:24] a species that looked just exactly like
[42:28] the one that was doing the brooding.
[42:30] Amen.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; God, man was made in the image of God.
[42:36] And he says, "And God placed his
[42:39] handiwork
[42:40] in the placed his handiwork in the
[42:43] garden of Eden and made him a helpmate."
[42:46] What a complete satisfaction
[42:50] it was to God till even he rested. Now
[42:53] the system was complete. And the system
[42:56] is complete when all the parts are
[42:59] present because the system must be a
[43:02] composite of all of the parts that were
[43:05] intended to be part of the system. If
[43:08] you take a certain part out, then you
[43:10] don't have a system anymore. It breaks
[43:12] down. We hear today the system broke
[43:15] down.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Something happened. The system couldn't
[43:19] function. The system got overloaded. The
[43:23] system broke down. And when the system
[43:25] breaks down, then it can't function
[43:28] anymore.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; We have physically speaking, we have a a
[43:33] nervous system, you have a blood
[43:35] circulatory system, you have a digestive
[43:38] system, you have all these systems which
[43:41] go to make up your physical body. But if
[43:45] one of those begins to fail, you're in
[43:47] trouble.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; True.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Just one of them.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; The shell is still here. You still look
[43:54] the same, but you can't act the same.
[43:56] You can't function properly. You can't
[43:59] do what you're supposed to do because
[44:01] the system starts to break down and the
[44:04] one is interrelated with the other. How
[44:08] thankful we are today. I trust that they
[44:11] all are working
[44:13] &gt;&gt; a systems of this of this of this body.
[44:16] But if the if if the very life of the
[44:20] body begins to depart this body, what
[44:24] good is your nervous system? What good
[44:27] is all the other systems that go to make
[44:29] you up? If the life goes
[44:35] there's nothing there.
[44:38] Prophet said God is a God of order and
[44:42] he will bring the thing right up then he
[44:46] will bring the thing into order. The
[44:49] thing that he has uh devised and
[44:52] designed in his mind he will bring it
[44:56] into order. And the scripture tells us
[44:58] how we look at the whole of creation
[45:01] that when God completed his work of
[45:04] creation and the prophet said and he
[45:07] rested and we read in the scripture when
[45:09] he completed the work of creation and
[45:12] all the system was in place the whole
[45:15] heavenly solar system the system of the
[45:19] universe all the planetary system all of
[45:22] these systems great eternal God who had
[45:25] made all of these things and then
[45:27] brought up all of the creatures and kept
[45:30] brooding over it by a spirit, brooding
[45:32] over it until finally one came on the
[45:35] scene that was in the image of the one
[45:37] who was brooding over it. And when it
[45:39] was all finished, then God stepped down
[45:42] into it. Then it was complete.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; It was not complete until God stepped
[45:50] down into it. And I don't care who is
[45:52] present or who's hearing my word today.
[45:55] I don't care what kind of system you
[45:57] function in. Whether it's your job or
[45:59] your educational system or whatever
[46:01] other kind of system you might have or
[46:03] your physical system and all of the all
[46:05] of the systems of your body that go to
[46:07] make it up, it is all empty
[46:10] &gt;&gt; unless he who designed it comes down
[46:12] into the midst of it. This whole church,
[46:14] you can have all the you can have the
[46:16] musical instruments and you can have the
[46:18] ministry and you can have the singers
[46:20] and you can have the deacons and you can
[46:22] have the trust. You can have the whole
[46:24] thing structured up, but un unless it's
[46:26] pleasing to God and God steps down into
[46:29] it, the whole structure is just empty.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[46:34] &gt;&gt; We want him,
[46:35] &gt;&gt; the author,
[46:37] &gt;&gt; the author and the finisher of our faith
[46:40] to be in amongst his people and then
[46:42] that gives us meaning here this morning.
[46:45] Otherwise, why are we sitting here? What
[46:47] are we listening to? What am I preaching
[46:49] for? What are we singing for? What are
[46:52] we playing instruments for? Why are you
[46:54] here? Unless he is here.
[46:59] And when he is pleased and comes down
[47:02] amongst us
[47:04] &gt;&gt; and I see h such uh such indication of
[47:08] his pleasure
[47:09] &gt;&gt; when he begins to move on the individual
[47:12] lives
[47:13] &gt;&gt; and uh we talk about the young people
[47:15] don't ever forget I'm not going to ride
[47:17] that
[47:19] play that tune as it were uh uh without
[47:22] without cause or without purpose. I tell
[47:25] you what, brother Brandham tells things
[47:27] that God did and it sounds like it was
[47:29] yesterday. Sometimes it's 30 years ago,
[47:32] &gt;&gt; many, many years ago. He tells about it.
[47:34] Why? Because it's just as fresh as it
[47:36] was yesterday. It's as fresh. And
[47:38] anything God has done, anything God has
[47:41] done of a supernatural nature, I tell
[47:43] you, it's just the same as he did it
[47:44] five minutes ago.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; And anything that God did amongst our
[47:48] our young people, and I I see them. I
[47:50] know their lives. I know what God
[47:52] delivered them from. And I see that they
[47:54] didn't they weren't even looking for
[47:56] God. Exactly as the prophet said, "We're
[47:58] looking for God. We're resisting it."
[48:00] And God came down.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Just like he took them by the coat and
[48:04] said, "I'm going to change you."
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; How many can raise their hands and say,
[48:09] "I have been changed in just the last
[48:11] little while."
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; I know Brother Josh has been changed. He
[48:17] couldn't do it within himself. And I'm
[48:19] rejoicing. I'm thrilled over what God
[48:22] has done amongst the young people and I
[48:24] want to see it continue. Hallelujah.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It didn't happen because we
[48:30] had some kind of a system. My wife and I
[48:32] last night just the last thing we we
[48:35] went and saw they had it uh just done up
[48:38] just released the the uh rich young
[48:40] ruler on the DVD and we went and saw it.
[48:43] We were still affected this morning
[48:46] really affected by seeing that. that
[48:48] brought to such reality. I tell you
[48:51] what, no wonder my wife was saying on
[48:53] the way to work, no wonder uh brother
[48:55] Brandham was so urgent when he talked
[48:58] about heaven. Don't miss it and about
[49:01] hell. Don't go there.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; And you wouldn't have a a prophet
[49:05] wasting his time on talking about not
[49:07] going there if it wasn't a direct a very
[49:10] definite possibility of going there.
[49:13] There is a hell to shen and there's a
[49:16] heaven to gain. And we want to keep that
[49:18] in mind all the time. Hallelujah.
[49:21] Everything else is just a shell.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; And we don't want to be where we don't
[49:25] want to be serving the shell.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; These businesses and all the rest of it,
[49:30] these jobs and and all of the education
[49:33] and everything else that we have around,
[49:35] they'll be a god to us if we don't take
[49:37] it under control. Say, "You're going to
[49:39] serve me. You're going to be my servant.
[49:41] I'm not going to be your servant."
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Man was not made to serve the system,
[49:52] but rather the system was put in place
[49:54] to serve man's needs. God said, "Behold,
[49:58] I have given you every herb bearing seed
[50:01] which is upon the face of the earth. And
[50:04] every tree in which is the fruit of of a
[50:07] tree yielding seed, to you it shall be
[50:10] for meat." This will be of service to
[50:12] you. You're not going to serve it. It's
[50:15] going to be a service to you.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; And in Genesis 2:16, and the Lord God
[50:20] commanded the man, saying, "Of every
[50:22] tree of the garden, thou mayest freely
[50:24] eat."
[50:26] Now everything gets out of cater when
[50:29] man rejects the truth of God's word.
[50:33] And what shall I do with Jesus? He said,
[50:36] "And what?" And that's what happened in
[50:38] Eden. When Eve got out of cater,
[50:42] the whole thing got off balance,
[50:45] you know, we can just bring it down to
[50:47] the individual life. We can do all kind.
[50:50] I would say that the rich young ruler's
[50:52] life was out of cater even though he he
[50:56] it was so obvious and it was so
[50:59] pronounced I will say when it was
[51:01] enacted at the at the camp how that the
[51:04] father and mother were teaching him and
[51:08] brother Brandham says in leadership how
[51:10] he was brought up right. He was brought
[51:13] up to honor the word of God. He was
[51:16] brought up to hear it and the rabbi
[51:18] taught him right and he listened to it.
[51:20] He he had the capacity to hear it and to
[51:24] observe it and he loved it.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; And it was so amazing that after Jesus
[51:30] told him to do the commandments in the
[51:32] scriptures and he was able to say all
[51:35] this have I done from my youth up
[51:39] and Jesus beholding him loved him. I
[51:44] tell you what, somebody who was obedient
[51:46] at home, somebody who was had the best
[51:49] kind of teachers in this in the school.
[51:51] And listen, we talk about school, they
[51:54] the Israelites didn't have a bunch of
[51:55] public schools like we have. Hey, they
[51:58] got a big commotion right now because
[52:00] they want to put on a Christmas play, if
[52:02] you can believe it, that is all that is
[52:04] all homosexually oriented. The Christmas
[52:07] play. And there's a big ruckus right
[52:09] here in this city of Suriri right now
[52:12] because the teachers want to put it on
[52:14] and the school board don't want it put
[52:16] on and the legal system says that you
[52:18] really need to be able to be allowed
[52:20] because it's free speech. If it's free
[52:22] speech and they really uphold it, why
[52:25] can't we go and have a meeting, a Holy
[52:27] Ghost meeting for their Christmas thing
[52:29] then?
[52:30] &gt;&gt; They'll never have that.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; But there's a big uproar because they
[52:35] can't have it. I can tell you what,
[52:37] friends. uh uh they have long long left
[52:42] the spiritual
[52:44] uh principles that the whole nation was
[52:46] based on in the first place.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; And and yet the rich young ruler, he
[52:52] went to a good school. He went to a
[52:55] school like we'd have here in the
[52:56] church. He had he had godly teachers.
[52:59] All of that. But when it came to that
[53:01] one thing, sell all thou hast and give
[53:04] it to the poor. That was the one thing.
[53:07] That was his strong point. That wasn't
[53:08] his weak point. His strong point was he
[53:11] was successful.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; He was good at business. That was his
[53:15] strong point. But that's what he
[53:16] couldn't surrender up. And we have if we
[53:20] have one area of our lives that we hold
[53:22] back from God. Remember the system won't
[53:25] function.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; The system won't function right. If we
[53:29] have an area and you know that God is
[53:31] dealing with that, he's dealing with
[53:33] that. it. Whatever it might be, it might
[53:35] be an attitude, it might be a feeling,
[53:37] it might be something that God calls a
[53:39] person to do, it might be your tithing,
[53:41] it might be your respect for one
[53:43] another, might be relationship, husband
[53:45] or wife. That thing cannot continue
[53:50] &gt;&gt; because then the system begins to break
[53:52] down
[53:53] &gt;&gt; and though what happens it becomes what
[53:55] becomes tragic is that then uh do you
[53:59] stop going to church? No. Do you stop
[54:01] singing? No. We we all do all of that.
[54:04] But all of that I'm saying can become an
[54:07] empty shell
[54:09] &gt;&gt; outside of God being in it.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; You know, we can take some of these
[54:17] things lightly. But on the other hand,
[54:19] Brother Bram says if if we just roar off
[54:21] with a temper like a buzzsaw, says the
[54:24] Holy Spirit will depart.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[54:27] &gt;&gt; True.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Is that what he said?
[54:29] &gt;&gt; You believe what he said? Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; All right. He said if we roar off like
[54:34] and just give vent to temper, then the
[54:36] Holy Spirit will go off like a a dove
[54:39] and sit off in a in a branch someplace.
[54:42] So what what do we have?
[54:44] &gt;&gt; We have a shell.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; That's what we have. We have a shell.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; We still we still say praise the Lord.
[54:50] We still say grace at the table. We
[54:52] still pray. We still read our Bible.
[54:54] Maybe read pick up and read a message
[54:55] book and all of those things. But
[54:57] remember without the without him being
[55:00] present the shell is an empty frame.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; It's an empty empty system.
[55:07] All right.
[55:14] I just move forward.
[55:17] When God called his children out of
[55:19] Egypt,
[55:21] there was the system of Egypt. He called
[55:23] him out of that, out of the system of
[55:26] slavery. And we all were there.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; And then he began to establish
[55:35] his people under his system. All of it,
[55:39] all of them didn't adhere to it
[55:41] completely.
[55:46] He describes it.
[55:49] He said, 'I imagine when the children
[55:52] saw those big black wings drop down from
[55:54] the sky like a smoke settling over the
[55:56] city and screams coming from every house
[55:59] and the children might have went to
[56:02] their daddy and said, "Daddy, are you
[56:04] sure that we're under the token?" And he
[56:07] could go to the door and look on upon
[56:09] the post and the lintle and say, "Son,
[56:11] that's according to the word."
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What the father is saying?
[56:17] We have the system in place.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; We have everything present.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; And how could he know is because we have
[56:25] done every word.
[56:28] And he says, remember the son saying,
[56:30] I'm your oldest son. I'm your oldest
[56:32] child, daddy. Are you positive? He said,
[56:34] I'm positive.
[56:36] That's according to what the prophet
[56:38] told us. And he has the word of the
[56:41] Lord. And when I see the blood, I'll
[56:43] pass over you. take a lamb for a house.
[56:45] He said, "I've brought all you children
[56:47] in. You're my eldest, my firstborn, and
[56:51] that's the one that's dying all out
[56:53] there. But there is the blood, and
[56:56] that's what thus sayeth the Lord was. So
[56:59] rest, my son, rest at ease because God
[57:03] made the promise."
[57:05] &gt;&gt; He says that son perhaps said, "Well,
[57:07] daddy, why do you got your shoes on? Why
[57:11] do you got the staff in your hand? Why
[57:13] have you got a piece of bread in your
[57:15] hand and a lamb in the other hand? Why
[57:18] are them better herbs and things? What
[57:20] are you eating it? What is the sweat
[57:22] running down your face about? Son, death
[57:26] fixing to strike. And see, it's a time
[57:29] of desperation. He preached token in the
[57:31] morning of desperation and this out of
[57:33] desperation. And and so the son is
[57:36] quering the children quering and
[57:38] especially the eldest son. I'm your
[57:39] eldest son. Yes.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Everything's hanging on my head.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; And I hear the screams out there. It's
[57:46] real, friends. This isn't a story. This
[57:49] is what happened. I hear the screams. I
[57:52] hear the wailing. I hear the parents and
[57:55] mothers and fathers wailing for their
[57:57] children. The wailing of the separation
[58:00] that death brings. Are you sure that
[58:02] we're protected? The only thing the
[58:04] father could say is, "We have done all
[58:07] that the prophet of God has spoken."
[58:09] Amen.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; That was his only anchor and that was
[58:12] the final piece. That was the piece that
[58:14] was essential.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; That was the piece that was essential.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; And that was the piece that was missing.
[58:22] Wherever he didn't see the blood, they
[58:24] hadn't heard what the prophet of God had
[58:26] spoken.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; And the system broke up. The system
[58:31] collapsed. The system failed.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:40] He said the word and the spoken word the
[58:43] original seed the word was with that
[58:46] anointed prophet because the word of the
[58:48] Lord came to the prophet and now God
[58:52] listen doesn't change his system.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; God doesn't change his system.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; No, he never changed his system. That's
[59:06] still the system.
[59:11] Once God had gathered his people, then
[59:13] he had a holy nation. It was unlike any
[59:16] other nation.
[59:19] They couldn't be like other nations.
[59:22] But yet God spoke through Moses and
[59:25] said, "And the Lord shall scatter you
[59:27] among the nations, and you shall be left
[59:29] few in number among the heathen, whether
[59:32] the Lord shall lead you, and there you
[59:34] shall serve, and there you shall serve
[59:37] gods, the work of men's hands, wood and
[59:41] stone." What is God telling him?
[59:44] You're going to be scattered and you're
[59:47] going to worship the gods of the people
[59:49] and the nations you come into. is
[59:51] prophesying by Moses about that.
[59:55] And of course, what he's telling them is
[59:57] that they will leave the God who brought
[1:00:00] them out of Egypt. They will leave their
[1:00:02] God.
[1:00:03] And he says, "And from thence thou shalt
[1:00:06] seek the Lord thy God, and thou shalt
[1:00:09] find him if thou shalt seek him with all
[1:00:11] thy heart and with all thy soul." So he
[1:00:14] give them this still a a a rider on the
[1:00:16] end as it were, a promise. Even when you
[1:00:19] leave, and even when I scatter you, and
[1:00:22] even when you forsake me, and even when
[1:00:24] you worship other gods, if you'll turn
[1:00:27] to me, you will be found. I will be
[1:00:29] found of you.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a promise it is for us
[1:00:33] today. Whatever state a person's in, no
[1:00:36] matter how far you may have gone, you
[1:00:38] need to come back.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To the original place,
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; and seek him with all your heart,
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; and all your soul, and he will be found
[1:00:49] of you, and he will be your God, and
[1:00:52] you'll be his child.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is there anything wrong with
[1:00:56] that? Say, "No, that sounds good to me."
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Perhaps we all were there.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:04] At some point in time,
[1:01:09] as a nation,
[1:01:12] a nation to be a nation,
[1:01:15] they must have a strong monetary system,
[1:01:20] a military system,
[1:01:22] have a highway system, a telephone
[1:01:24] system,
[1:01:28] social services system,
[1:01:31] all the systems
[1:01:33] must have all their parts or they don't
[1:01:35] function
[1:01:37] in order to make a nation. In the
[1:01:40] Philadelphiaian church age, brother
[1:01:42] Brandham says at the right time,
[1:01:45] the harlot will destroy the present day
[1:01:49] money system.
[1:01:51] At the right time,
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; the harlot will destroy will destroy the
[1:01:56] present day money system by calling in
[1:02:00] all the paper and demanding gold. And
[1:02:04] with no gold, the system
[1:02:08] fails.
[1:02:11] Now friends,
[1:02:13] whether in my lifetime or whether in
[1:02:15] yours,
[1:02:17] and we may even be there and not even be
[1:02:20] aware of it,
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Because if we just have some paper in
[1:02:23] our pocket and say, "Well, you know, I
[1:02:25] got some I got I got some money here and
[1:02:28] it and all it is is is a it's a means to
[1:02:31] exchange."
[1:02:33] So this tells me is a dollar US tells me
[1:02:35] I can buy something that's a dollar US.
[1:02:38] It's only a a means of exchange. And you
[1:02:42] know, there can be a means of exchange,
[1:02:43] but no no substance underneath it.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; And here we are and we're doing things
[1:02:49] and we're buying things and we're
[1:02:50] selling things and doing all kinds of uh
[1:02:52] uh economics and all kinds of
[1:02:54] transactions and so on. But but the
[1:02:58] prophet's talking about the gold. Yes.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; He's not talking about whether we have
[1:03:03] bills by millions of dollars floating
[1:03:06] around the country, but is there any
[1:03:07] substance in between? And we have lived,
[1:03:10] most of us here have lived to see
[1:03:12] economies collapse.
[1:03:14] They've collapsed in South America. It
[1:03:16] collapsed in Germany. It collapsed in
[1:03:19] Yugoslavia.
[1:03:21] In Yugoslavia, they were finally
[1:03:23] printing money and the p the value of
[1:03:26] the money was not worth the ink and the
[1:03:30] paper that it was taking to print the
[1:03:32] print the piece of paper. I came back
[1:03:34] here, I think the last time, with around
[1:03:36] $30 billion. I thought I got enough here
[1:03:39] to buy the entire city of Vancouver if
[1:03:42] they'd only listen to me and have any
[1:03:44] confidence in this money. But the thing
[1:03:46] was there's nothing behind it. You can
[1:03:48] print all the zeros you want.
[1:03:51] Brother Milo and I were kind of having a
[1:03:53] joke because I said, "There's so many
[1:03:54] zeros there. I can't even I don't know
[1:03:56] this figure. I don't know how to read
[1:03:58] this." He said, "Yeah." He said, "They,
[1:04:00] but that's with four. They just dropped
[1:04:01] off four.
[1:04:04] They just dropped off four zeros." And I
[1:04:06] was in a farmhouse and there was a
[1:04:08] couple little girls there about six,
[1:04:09] seven, eight years old and they had a
[1:04:11] whole shoe box and and stacked in this
[1:04:14] shoe box on the edge was just billions
[1:04:16] and billions and billions of dollars.
[1:04:18] And they were fooling around with this
[1:04:19] money. This is all current money. This
[1:04:21] is money that was circulating in the
[1:04:23] country. I said to the parents, "How do
[1:04:25] you live?" Says, "Well, we trade a
[1:04:27] chicken for some vegetables or back and
[1:04:30] forth and that's the only way we can
[1:04:31] live." The money is if you gave them any
[1:04:33] money, they just make a joke out of it.
[1:04:37] Joke. Why? Because there's no substance
[1:04:39] behind it.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; The money was there. Machines were
[1:04:42] printing it and everybody had it, but
[1:04:46] there was nothing behind it. So the
[1:04:48] system collapsed. Brother Brandham says
[1:04:50] that our economic system is going to
[1:04:53] collapse because Rome is going to call
[1:04:56] for gold.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; And they've done it already once.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Did it already once and shook up the
[1:05:03] entire gold when when when President de
[1:05:05] Gaul of France called in all the US
[1:05:08] paper, had all the US paper and called
[1:05:11] on the US to buy it all back with gold.
[1:05:14] Gold then was $35 an ounce. It's never
[1:05:17] been $35 an ounce since
[1:05:20] something between 4 and 500. I don't
[1:05:22] know. I don't keep track of it, but it's
[1:05:24] it's it's up over $400 an ounce. Has
[1:05:26] been up over $700 an ounce. And people
[1:05:29] are making all kinds of, you know, uh
[1:05:31] making all kinds of predictions about
[1:05:33] the gold and where it's going to go and
[1:05:35] so on. I I couldn't care less where it
[1:05:36] goes. But I know one place is going to
[1:05:38] go is going to go to Rome. They're going
[1:05:40] to call it all in
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; and they want want to get rid and the
[1:05:44] pope can have influence on all the
[1:05:47] Catholic nations and it may not be it
[1:05:49] may not be the Vatican bank itself but
[1:05:53] it may well be the other nations which
[1:05:56] are solely committed to the pope and his
[1:05:59] leadership and he simply has to initiate
[1:06:02] the thing and they will do it
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; and call it in.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:15] God told the people
[1:06:17] under Moses, and I'm going to move from
[1:06:18] that up to today in just a moment, but
[1:06:21] he told them to build a tabernacle. And
[1:06:24] he said, "Now, uh, you'll build a
[1:06:27] tabernacle
[1:06:28] and let them build me a sanctuary." But
[1:06:30] here is the purpose of it. Let them
[1:06:32] build me a sanctuary
[1:06:35] that I may dwell among them.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; That's the purpose. In other words, you
[1:06:42] build a sanctuary and they could have
[1:06:44] done absolutely everything. every socket
[1:06:46] and every joint and every pole and every
[1:06:49] skin and and every every piece of cloth
[1:06:52] and the the royal blue and all the
[1:06:54] embroidery and the priests and all their
[1:06:56] garments and the priesthood could be set
[1:06:58] up and Aaron and he could have had the
[1:07:00] base and a blood they could have had
[1:07:02] absolutely everything. But if God didn't
[1:07:04] come down amongst them, then the system
[1:07:07] would collapse.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Listen to me friends, there'd be no
[1:07:10] mercy.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; There would be no grace.
[1:07:15] There'd be no forgiveness amongst the
[1:07:17] people because God needed to be amongst
[1:07:19] them. And if they hadn't done
[1:07:20] everything, if they just said, "Well,
[1:07:22] you know, it's a little too much trouble
[1:07:23] for us to go and get this kind of wood,
[1:07:25] this satim wood for the ark. Let's just
[1:07:27] use something else."
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing, God wouldn't
[1:07:31] have come down.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "According to all
[1:07:38] that I show thee, after the pattern of
[1:07:41] the tabernacle and the pattern of all
[1:07:42] the instruments thereof, even so shall
[1:07:44] it be." So everything had to be in its
[1:07:46] play place. But the purpose of the
[1:07:48] tabernacle was so that God could be
[1:07:50] amongst them. And the scripture says,
[1:07:52] "And he reared up the court around about
[1:07:54] the tabernacle and the altar and set up
[1:07:57] the hanging of the court gate." So Moses
[1:08:00] finished the work. So Moses finished the
[1:08:02] work. Then
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. The cloud covered the tent of the
[1:08:08] congregation. My brother, my sister, I'm
[1:08:12] not interested I'm not interested in
[1:08:14] just having, you know, uh, uh, church as
[1:08:17] a ceremony. I'm interested in having
[1:08:20] having it in such a way so that he
[1:08:22] himself be here amongst us. I'm not
[1:08:25] interested in having a home or a family
[1:08:27] or anything else just for the sake of
[1:08:29] having a home. We want one where God
[1:08:32] will be honored.
[1:08:33] Hallelujah.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; And you want to as a as parents, you
[1:08:37] want to deny the devil any right to to
[1:08:41] introduce anything other than what God
[1:08:44] has said in his word.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; And I strive to to live by it.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; We need to.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; You believe that? Yes.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; But the and the scripture tells us that
[1:09:00] the he says now the of Paul said in
[1:09:02] Hebrews 8:1, "Now of the things which we
[1:09:05] have spoken,
[1:09:07] this is the sum. We have such an high
[1:09:10] priest who is at the right hand of the
[1:09:11] throne of the majesty of high, a
[1:09:13] minister of the sanctuary and of the
[1:09:16] true tabernacle which the Lord pitched
[1:09:18] and not man. For the scripture tells us
[1:09:20] and teaches us that we you are a
[1:09:25] tabernacle
[1:09:26] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; And the prophet brings out clearly from
[1:09:32] the scriptures that you are each one of
[1:09:35] you sitting here. You have a holy of
[1:09:38] holies
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; which is right down into the regions of
[1:09:41] your soul. You have a holy of holies.
[1:09:44] Every person that sits here, that's how
[1:09:46] many holy of holies that we have. You as
[1:09:49] an individual have a holy of holies and
[1:09:52] God comes to that place.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; These other things, this whole
[1:10:00] tabernacle and everything that uh
[1:10:03] related to it only only was indicative
[1:10:07] of you as an individual and we must
[1:10:11] never never lose sight of that. We are
[1:10:14] the tabernacle of the Holy Ghost. As the
[1:10:17] apostle Paul says, "What know ye not
[1:10:20] that your body is the temple of the Holy
[1:10:22] Ghost which is in you which you have of
[1:10:25] God which are and ye are not your own."
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Now let's just here we are a bunch of uh
[1:10:35] material.
[1:10:38] What if we were back in Moses' time and
[1:10:41] we have the poles, we have the rings and
[1:10:44] we have the sockets and here the ladies
[1:10:46] have prepared all the all the cloth and
[1:10:48] the material and the embroider work and
[1:10:51] we have the garments and so on so forth.
[1:10:54] No, but we don't have we don't have a
[1:10:58] prophet to tell us what to do with it.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Say, well, maybe we should just attach
[1:11:05] this to that, you know, that looks real
[1:11:07] nice. Maybe we should I think that would
[1:11:10] be good for Aaron. No, I don't think
[1:11:12] that'll look good on Aaron. You know
[1:11:14] what? You'd have confusion in mass.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Absolute confusion in mass. And that's
[1:11:20] why every church is sitting where they
[1:11:22] are today. It's confusion and mass
[1:11:25] because they don't know what to do with
[1:11:26] the pieces. When a word of God come and
[1:11:29] told them what to do with the pieces
[1:11:30] that this joint goes to this joint, and
[1:11:32] this is how this is to be, and this is
[1:11:34] how this is to be shaped. And when it's
[1:11:36] done according to his word, then comes
[1:11:38] it the whole thing comes into an order.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; And down through the church ages, oh
[1:11:45] friends, I have so much it's hard for me
[1:11:47] to get to it. But down through the
[1:11:48] church ages, the Holy Spirit moving. And
[1:11:51] when God moves in an original way,
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; that is the that is the very life of the
[1:11:57] system.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; And then as time goes on, the people
[1:12:01] they begin to feel, well, I don't know
[1:12:03] if that's really so necessary anymore.
[1:12:05] Yeah, I've heard it. I've heard it. I've
[1:12:06] heard it. And we sit there and do not
[1:12:09] bend to the word of God. I tell you, God
[1:12:12] will leave that.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; God will leave you.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; I hate to say that, but God will leave a
[1:12:18] person if they resist the word of God
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; and they hear it preached and it's
[1:12:22] anointed and they know it's from God and
[1:12:24] they sit there anyway. God will leave
[1:12:26] you
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; and you'll still come here. You'll sit
[1:12:31] in church, but that won't do anything
[1:12:33] for you.
[1:12:35] It's living by every word of God.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; I feel it really burning very very heavy
[1:12:43] on my heart. This is more than just a
[1:12:45] structure.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; This is this isn't this building means
[1:12:47] nothing. And the whole group of people.
[1:12:50] We don't mean anything outside of God
[1:12:52] being amongst us.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; There's a church has got 30,000 people.
[1:12:56] They may be able to rejoice in the fact
[1:12:58] we've been so successful and millions
[1:13:00] are listening to us on television today.
[1:13:03] in the fact maybe this is one of the
[1:13:04] this is one of the larger churches in
[1:13:06] America at least in in North America uh
[1:13:09] in in the message I don't take any glory
[1:13:11] in that without God we're nothing
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; say while we hear some powerful sermons
[1:13:17] all kinds of people hear powerful
[1:13:19] sermons mighty sermons people are
[1:13:22] talented and they're gifted speakers and
[1:13:24] they've got such a a way with their
[1:13:26] words that doesn't mean anything outside
[1:13:29] of God being there I'm not interested in
[1:13:32] just a feeling. I'm not interested in
[1:13:34] just the anointing itself. Lots of
[1:13:36] people are anointed, but we got to have
[1:13:38] God down in the soul of the individual.
[1:13:43] And they need that prophet's words to
[1:13:45] put people into place and and to shape
[1:13:48] us into vessels. We could have had all
[1:13:51] the all the instruments and all the
[1:13:53] material, but if we just left it up to
[1:13:55] the people, what do we do with this?
[1:13:57] What do we do with the trumpet? Some
[1:13:58] some excuse me, someone might say, "Oh,
[1:14:00] I think we should blow the trumpet when
[1:14:02] we have dinner."
[1:14:05] Now, he says, "Blow the trumpet for the
[1:14:06] moving of the camps. Blow the trumpet
[1:14:09] for war."
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; And there was a specific, "How do they
[1:14:12] know when to blow the trumpet?" Because
[1:14:13] the prophet told them when to blow the
[1:14:15] trumpet.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Somebody might have said, "I know how to
[1:14:17] blow a trumpet. I know when to play. I
[1:14:20] know." That had nothing to do with it.
[1:14:21] It's what he said.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; We're not interested in what people
[1:14:24] think. We're interested in what he said.
[1:14:27] Hallelujah.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; People got all kinds of ideas about how
[1:14:31] things ought to be. We're not interested
[1:14:33] in how people think, what people think
[1:14:35] about how things ought to be. We're
[1:14:36] interested in what he said it should be.
[1:14:38] Because then when peace comes to peace.
[1:14:41] Hallelujah. And pull comes the socket
[1:14:43] and the banner and the uh all of the
[1:14:45] material and all of the things that that
[1:14:48] were and the vessels all put together.
[1:14:51] Put the table here.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Put the table there. Put the candlestick
[1:14:56] here. put these instruments in order. He
[1:14:58] said on the table
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; in order.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Even Moses didn't have an idea. He
[1:15:05] couldn't have a thought and say, "Well,
[1:15:07] you know, Lord, uh why don't we do it
[1:15:08] this way?" No. When he comes and God
[1:15:12] speaks, we say, "So be it. So be it. So
[1:15:15] be it." That's the order that we want.
[1:15:17] So be it. And then when it's all done
[1:15:20] according to him and it says when Moses
[1:15:22] was finished and we're finished, then
[1:15:24] God comes down amongst us,
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; then the system will work.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Then the thing you crave for, oh God, we
[1:15:31] want to see men and women delivered. We
[1:15:34] want to see healings take place. I tell
[1:15:36] you, the system needs to operate
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; in the system. You're part of the
[1:15:40] system.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; People think, well, things aren't
[1:15:44] happening in the church the way it ought
[1:15:45] to happen. Maybe something's wrong with
[1:15:46] the preacher. Just remember, he's only
[1:15:48] one piece.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; He's only one piece. And the other
[1:15:51] piece, you're you're commanded to pray
[1:15:53] for this peace.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're commanded to pray for
[1:15:57] one another. We're commanded to love one
[1:16:00] another.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; How do you love one another when you
[1:16:04] don't even come to church? And the word
[1:16:07] of God commands you to love one another.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; This is not an option. You're commanded
[1:16:12] to love one another.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Is this the word of God? Is this the
[1:16:16] message?
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what the scripture and
[1:16:20] then you want things to happen and to be
[1:16:22] a in a blissful way maybe in your life
[1:16:25] or everything be together. Things won't
[1:16:27] be together in your life because the
[1:16:29] system breaks down.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; You say what is the system? The one
[1:16:34] sitting next to you is part of the
[1:16:35] system.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your wife, your husband's
[1:16:38] part of the system. Your children, your
[1:16:40] parents are part of the system. I happen
[1:16:42] to be part of the system. just a part.
[1:16:44] Every ministering brother happened to be
[1:16:46] part of the system. The deacons are part
[1:16:48] of the system and the trustees are part
[1:16:51] of the system. But that system without
[1:16:54] God is just an empty shell.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Would it stop service if God departs a
[1:17:03] place? No. No. No. We have all kinds of
[1:17:06] activity and things going on. We're
[1:17:07] doing this and we're doing that and
[1:17:09] we're doing something else. God's not
[1:17:11] interested.
[1:17:15] Israel was not a nation like other
[1:17:17] nations.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; They were a called out people.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; But they started looking elsewhere.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, they do it.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, we see all the pomp and all the
[1:17:32] glamour that these other nations have
[1:17:34] and they began to desire that." And
[1:17:37] then, oh, shouldn't we be structured
[1:17:39] like that? Wouldn't it be nice to be
[1:17:41] that way? You know,
[1:17:44] we they have a king. Look at those
[1:17:48] robes. Oh my goodness. Look at all that.
[1:17:51] Hey, look at all these marvelous things.
[1:17:58] They got a lot of glamour. They got a
[1:17:59] lot of glitz. They got a lot. Oh,
[1:18:02] shouldn't we have that? I think we
[1:18:04] should. Let's vote on it. Yeah, we need
[1:18:07] a king. Samuel,
[1:18:11] we need a king.
[1:18:14] You've just smitten.
[1:18:17] What? What do you want a king for?
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; We want to be like other nations.
[1:18:25] You know, the word of God touches us in
[1:18:26] our individual life.
[1:18:29] How we ought to live, how we ought to
[1:18:32] act, how we ought to dress,
[1:18:35] how we ought to deal with one another.
[1:18:43] And then maybe
[1:18:46] some young man or some young lady looks
[1:18:48] over over the fence say another church
[1:18:50] says, "Well, they do it. That has
[1:18:52] nothing to do with it."
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with it.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; They do it.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Since when?
[1:19:02] You won't find that between Genesis and
[1:19:03] Revelation. Well, they do it.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; There's another do. What does God say to
[1:19:08] you down here?
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; What What does the word of God say?
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; And then when we hear what he says, this
[1:19:16] is how it's to be. This piece to that
[1:19:19] piece, this bone to that bone.
[1:19:23] And then when it's finished, then God
[1:19:26] steps down into it.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; And then the system's complete. And it's
[1:19:31] not complete until then.
[1:19:34] and and and so Samuel began to tell them
[1:19:37] trying to watch my time. Samuel began to
[1:19:39] tell them, "Listen friends,
[1:19:43] listen children, that's fine. You know,
[1:19:47] you put the pressure on and we can do
[1:19:49] it, but God won't be in it."
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "In fact is the system's going
[1:19:54] to change.
[1:19:57] He's going to take your young men
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; and they're going to be his army
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; and he's going to take your young ladies
[1:20:05] and you're going to be his
[1:20:06] confectionaries.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; You're going to be doing things for him
[1:20:10] and he's going to tax you. You're going
[1:20:13] to pay taxes into the kingdom. Instead
[1:20:15] of paying tithe to God, you'll be taxes
[1:20:18] into the kingdom. And this whole system
[1:20:20] is going to change this whole apparatus.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; And they listen to him.
[1:20:26] And they said, "We want him anyway.
[1:20:32] We want our king anyway." That
[1:20:34] incredible brother Ernie, "We want our
[1:20:36] king anyway." You know, that is a
[1:20:41] that's sometime a very difficult thing.
[1:20:42] Brother Brandham said, and I I I
[1:20:46] have the quote here, but I don't know if
[1:20:47] I have it right in front of me.
[1:20:50] And even though he told them everything,
[1:20:54] he said, "Sometimes the people still
[1:20:56] want their way. They just want their
[1:20:58] way." I pray that God permit us and
[1:21:01] allow us as a congregation that when we
[1:21:04] hear what the word of God says on a
[1:21:08] certain issue, we'll be very quick to
[1:21:10] respond to it and say, "Lord, here I
[1:21:12] am." It's not what I think. It's not
[1:21:14] what somebody else has told me. It's not
[1:21:16] what I see over the fence, but it's what
[1:21:17] you've spoken to my own heart. It's what
[1:21:20] you have given to me right here and I I
[1:21:22] surrender myself to it. I give myself to
[1:21:24] it. We say amen to that.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Cancer.
[1:21:30] What is cancer? You know, brother
[1:21:32] Brandham talked about it way back in the
[1:21:34] 50s. And I don't know what they had
[1:21:36] really discovered about it then, but
[1:21:38] he's talked about it being a wild cell.
[1:21:41] A wild cell. A cell gets out of place
[1:21:44] and then what happens? The system begins
[1:21:46] to break down.
[1:21:48] Now I'm I'm coming to something. So just
[1:21:50] stay very very alert. So here comes the
[1:21:54] servant of God.
[1:21:56] And I could say that we are cells in the
[1:21:58] kingdom of God. We are cells in the body
[1:22:00] of Christ.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Now here comes you got that.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; We are all just visualize yourself. I'm
[1:22:07] a cell in the body of Christ. Okay. Now,
[1:22:11] here comes a prophet and he's standing
[1:22:13] here
[1:22:15] and there's a let's say there's a man or
[1:22:17] a woman standing here
[1:22:19] and they've got a cancer. So now he
[1:22:23] tells them that cancer is a cell in your
[1:22:25] body that's gone wild and it's out of
[1:22:28] place. Okay? And then he begins to
[1:22:32] relate to them what the angel of the
[1:22:35] Lord who came to him told him.
[1:22:39] Nothing will stand before your prayers
[1:22:42] if you can get the people to believe.
[1:22:45] Nothing will stand before your prayers,
[1:22:47] not even cancer.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; So what he's telling him, the angel of
[1:22:51] the Lord coming to him, telling him,
[1:22:53] this wild cell that has gone wild within
[1:22:57] this person's body, nothing will stand
[1:23:00] before your prayers. In other words, you
[1:23:02] will call that cell back into its proper
[1:23:05] place. Amen.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; I give you that authority. If you can
[1:23:09] just get the people to believe you
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; and then if they don't believe this
[1:23:13] sign, they will believe the next one
[1:23:15] because I'll cause you to know the very
[1:23:17] secret of their heart and they'll know
[1:23:19] it's God.
[1:23:22] [Applause]
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; But what is what is God indicating to
[1:23:25] the people to the people who ought to
[1:23:27] understand? What is he saying to the
[1:23:29] people? He's saying to them
[1:23:32] that here is the here is the servant
[1:23:35] that I'm giving authority over
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; that cell to bring it back into its
[1:23:41] place and back into order.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Now that person may have been healed and
[1:23:49] never served God, never surrendered
[1:23:50] themselves to God. I don't know. Maybe
[1:23:52] it could have just gone back to the
[1:23:54] church and I don't know anything about
[1:23:55] them. But God was indicating and this is
[1:23:58] a powerful thing to me that I want to
[1:24:00] get across to the church today. When God
[1:24:03] sends a prophet and if you are a word,
[1:24:07] you have been sent and you are a word to
[1:24:09] be manifest in this time and if God then
[1:24:12] sends a messenger with the word for this
[1:24:14] season, that word will match to this
[1:24:17] word.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And then when he speaks
[1:24:20] it, so then when he began to speak,
[1:24:23] especially in the opening of the word,
[1:24:24] the revelation of the word and the and
[1:24:27] the third pull of his ministry began to
[1:24:29] speak that begin to react
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; on the other cells of the body,
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; the body of Christ, and begin to pull
[1:24:37] them together,
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; pull them out of maybe the best kind of
[1:24:41] church or religion that they knew, but
[1:24:42] began to pull them and began to get them
[1:24:45] into their place. Hallelujah. and began
[1:24:48] to put uh joint to joint and bone to
[1:24:51] bone and socket to socket and began to
[1:24:54] call a body of Christ together. What
[1:24:56] for? So that Christ himself can come
[1:24:59] down in the midst of that body and have
[1:25:02] the system complete.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; And outside of that, the system is not
[1:25:08] complete.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; It's not complete. You can have the
[1:25:12] finest church you can have. You can go
[1:25:13] under message or reveal truth or
[1:25:15] whatever more. You got to have But I
[1:25:18] tell you what, we need an individual
[1:25:19] personal revelation from God that this
[1:25:22] message and messenger came to put me
[1:25:25] into my place.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Put my ministry where it
[1:25:28] should be. Put you in your place as a
[1:25:32] husband, as a wife, as a brother, a
[1:25:34] sister in Christ, as a young person. And
[1:25:37] that's what's happened, young people, in
[1:25:39] the last few weeks. A bunch of you were
[1:25:41] not in your place. You were not where
[1:25:43] God wanted you to have to be. And God
[1:25:45] just decided, you're not going to stay
[1:25:47] there any longer. We're coming to the
[1:25:49] rapture and you have I'm going to act on
[1:25:51] this and I'm going to move you into your
[1:25:53] place. And you heard the word of God.
[1:25:56] You heard the message from the messenger
[1:25:58] that God sent us. You heard his word.
[1:26:00] You opened your heart and the Holy
[1:26:02] Spirit come and took control and began
[1:26:05] to move you into your place.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Then God comes down not only into your
[1:26:11] life. God comes down into the gathering
[1:26:14] of the people. God comes down in the
[1:26:16] young people's gatherings. God comes
[1:26:18] down in the congregation. Are you with
[1:26:20] me? God comes down and then the system
[1:26:23] can function.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And not till then.
[1:26:30] And when he functions, I tell you what,
[1:26:32] all manner of things takes place. The
[1:26:34] supernatural, we're not here to discuss,
[1:26:36] oh, we we don't want the supernatural.
[1:26:38] Of course, we want the supernatural.
[1:26:40] Amen.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; I want everything God has.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; And whatever he chooses to do, let him
[1:26:46] come down amongst us and he'll decide
[1:26:48] what he wants to do. I'm not going to
[1:26:50] sit here and tell him he can do this, he
[1:26:52] can do that, he can't do this, can't do
[1:26:53] that. Let him do whatever he wants to
[1:26:55] do.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; I look for him to take the take control
[1:26:59] of an entire meeting
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; and let it come under the direct uh
[1:27:04] control of the Holy Spirit. when God the
[1:27:07] life comes down and then we're not I'm
[1:27:10] not here just to serve you in a in in a
[1:27:14] in a fashion uh just as just as an
[1:27:17] activity
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; while we're debtors to one another. And
[1:27:20] when you when you give or you stand at
[1:27:22] the tithe box and give you want to drop
[1:27:24] that envelope down, you want to know
[1:27:27] that you're not just giving some
[1:27:29] continuation to some dead carcass.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Want to say this is a living cell of
[1:27:34] God.
[1:27:36] And I have confidence in the leadership
[1:27:38] that God has sent. Not not only in the
[1:27:41] pastor, but a leadership in your own
[1:27:43] life. I have confidence.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Am I making sense to you?
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; I tell you what,
[1:27:52] friends,
[1:27:54] at church,
[1:27:56] I've been around a bit. I've been around
[1:27:59] I've been around the message a whole
[1:28:01] lot. And you can have all kinds of
[1:28:03] things. You can have the music all
[1:28:04] whipped up and you can have you can have
[1:28:06] all the instruments playing and you can
[1:28:08] have the song leader, you know, singing.
[1:28:10] You can have all the volume that just uh
[1:28:13] blow your eardrums out. That's because
[1:28:14] we got power through the wires and all
[1:28:16] the rest of it. But as far as God is
[1:28:18] concerned,
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; are you listening?
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; As far as God is concerned, that can be
[1:28:24] that can be a true worship on one hand,
[1:28:26] but on the other hand, it can just be a
[1:28:28] whole lot of emptiness.
[1:28:31] I want to make myself clear on that.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; You know, I I play an instrument. I play
[1:28:36] uh uh guitar instrument, but I've I've
[1:28:39] often said, you know, mine is just a
[1:28:41] solid block. Just a solid block. There's
[1:28:43] nothing there unless you get the unless
[1:28:46] you get the electricity going to it. And
[1:28:48] that's where I that's where I started
[1:28:50] thinking about that song that the girls
[1:28:52] finally sang. They made a little
[1:28:54] humorous thing out of it. But there'll
[1:28:55] be no wires in heaven. Right?
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; It'll be, you know, God's more
[1:28:59] interested in your voice.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because he wants to know
[1:29:02] what's inside of you.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; He's more interested in your voice than
[1:29:05] he isn't interested in in what somebody
[1:29:07] plays on a on a guitar or a piano or
[1:29:09] whatever more. And while all of that
[1:29:11] goes, that's why that's why we talk
[1:29:13] about these things in this light. He's
[1:29:15] more interested in what is coming out of
[1:29:17] your inside.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:21] I I was even in in one church, one
[1:29:23] place, and the song leader played a
[1:29:25] guitar and they had all the instruments
[1:29:28] at piano and organ at least and uh the
[1:29:31] music was just incredible and and uh uh
[1:29:34] the volume was more than I could almost
[1:29:36] bear
[1:29:39] and the people all clapped their hands,
[1:29:41] but the song leader was such a wonderful
[1:29:43] song leader, the people never did sing.
[1:29:45] They just clap their hands and rejoice
[1:29:48] and jump around and had a great time.
[1:29:51] And I thought, "This isn't this isn't
[1:29:54] what God wants to hear."
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; I talked to the pastor and I stood up
[1:29:59] before the people. I said, "God's not
[1:30:01] really interested how much volume you
[1:30:03] can turn up on the on the amplifier or
[1:30:06] the sound system. That's not what you
[1:30:08] know, God's not waiting and say, "Oh, I
[1:30:11] sure hope they turn up the volume this
[1:30:12] morning.
[1:30:15] Come on.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; That's not what he's saying. He's saying
[1:30:18] he's sitting back and just waiting for
[1:30:20] the incense of the voices of the people.
[1:30:24] Hallelujah. Hear what comes from the
[1:30:26] inside
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; cuz that tells them the system's
[1:30:30] working.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; I have to be honest with you. I I
[1:30:38] sometimes I've had my times of
[1:30:39] frustration when maybe the sound in the
[1:30:42] building or something hasn't been
[1:30:43] exactly right. Especially we're in
[1:30:44] special meetings and you know I get I
[1:30:46] get on the call of brothers call the
[1:30:48] people in the sound because I don't want
[1:30:49] the sound system uh to fail us.
[1:30:54] Especially get a a speaker in uh guest
[1:30:58] speaker get them all hooked up and all
[1:31:00] wired up and all the microphones and all
[1:31:02] the rest of it and all the sound and all
[1:31:03] the rest of it and he stands up there
[1:31:04] and doesn't work.
[1:31:08] Yeah, that that's just a little sound
[1:31:10] system
[1:31:11] stands up there and it a great big sound
[1:31:14] and the amplifier start to blow up and
[1:31:16] all the rest of it and the speaker is
[1:31:17] making all kinds of noise and people are
[1:31:19] frustrated and looking what happened.
[1:31:21] Well, it's just very simple. The sound
[1:31:23] system kind of started to fail. It got
[1:31:27] overloaded. And I asked the brothers,
[1:31:29] "What happened?" Well, this happened,
[1:31:30] that happened. It got kind of overloaded
[1:31:32] and started to kind of burn out and all
[1:31:34] this that. Okay, I don't understand it,
[1:31:35] but something happened. The system
[1:31:37] failed.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; But when I see, you know, when I would
[1:31:41] see and like I've been there, I don't
[1:31:43] have it here. But when I see that, you
[1:31:46] know, all the worship is just only
[1:31:48] carried by, you know, maybe a song, two
[1:31:51] or three people and song leader and and
[1:31:53] uh and you don't hear the people. Oh, I
[1:31:56] say something's wrong.
[1:31:59] the other day. Sometimes I look to the
[1:32:01] uh people playing the instruments and I
[1:32:03] wonder if they're singing because I like
[1:32:06] to I like to uh I I was playing with the
[1:32:10] young people the other night and and I I
[1:32:12] was singing while I was playing. I was
[1:32:14] trying to I was trying to sing and I was
[1:32:16] trying to play and I wasn't making very
[1:32:18] good job of both. But I while I was
[1:32:20] singing I thought I hope this catches on
[1:32:21] with some of the other musicians because
[1:32:23] I like to see musicians sing too because
[1:32:26] you know we we play unto the Lord but
[1:32:28] the scripture also says we sing unto the
[1:32:30] Lord.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about this for
[1:32:33] brother Bisl? Because it it it it
[1:32:35] indicates what's going on inside.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you. I think I do
[1:32:40] know about you but I'll just say it that
[1:32:41] way. and and when uh uh when songs are
[1:32:45] being sung and praise and worship, even
[1:32:48] when people get up and sing specials, I
[1:32:50] have to I have to keep myself from
[1:32:52] singing along with them. It's it's fine
[1:32:54] for them to sing, but I want to sing.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why? Because it's in here.
[1:32:59] It's down in here. I want to say it.
[1:33:01] Hallelujah.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; When somebody says, "Glory to God," and
[1:33:06] they start to sing, I want to sing along
[1:33:08] with them.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's in here. Hallelujah.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; At least I I believe that somehow the
[1:33:14] system's working.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; I've never had so many times, excuse for
[1:33:22] these couple personal things, but I've
[1:33:24] never had so many times people saying,
[1:33:25] "Brother Biscll, how old are you? How
[1:33:28] old are you? I've had it so many times
[1:33:29] this summer. How old are you?" So, well,
[1:33:33] I'm 70. 70? My goodness. Oh, you get up
[1:33:36] there. when I saw you bring your hand
[1:33:37] down like that. Oh, you know, nobody
[1:33:41] told me I wasn't supposed to do that.
[1:33:42] Nobody told me I was not. So, nobody
[1:33:44] told me I had to act 70.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; So, I might as well just act what I on
[1:33:48] the inside. Hallelujah.
[1:33:50] That the system's working.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; And I encourage you, we want to we want
[1:33:58] to do and respond to what the Holy
[1:34:01] Spirit, the spirit of God. You believe
[1:34:03] you're a vessel of the Holy Spirit?
[1:34:05] Amen.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Just give me a couple more minutes and
[1:34:09] I'm going to be done here.
[1:34:18] I said a few moments ago, every move of
[1:34:20] God is original and then man devises a
[1:34:24] system or an arrangement of parts and
[1:34:27] soon the sight of the objective, the
[1:34:30] actual objective is lost and the people
[1:34:33] begin to serve the system rather than
[1:34:36] the very life of the system.
[1:34:41] And there's a system for the home,
[1:34:44] uh, a system in your job.
[1:34:48] And I didn't want to get on this, but I
[1:34:50] think I will just for a moment.
[1:34:57] And to something that actually has, you
[1:34:59] know, I guess I could say, pained me in
[1:35:01] my heart.
[1:35:05] And I I have I have brought it up
[1:35:07] before. I've just touched on it, but now
[1:35:09] in the context of what I'm speaking of
[1:35:11] now, like to just say, you know,
[1:35:16] make certain
[1:35:18] that
[1:35:20] God is in charge of every area of our
[1:35:23] lives.
[1:35:25] Oh, you young people,
[1:35:27] you may go on to some something further
[1:35:31] in your life.
[1:35:33] Uh uh maybe further education. That's a
[1:35:36] big thing now. further education, you're
[1:35:39] going to go to college or whatever more.
[1:35:42] I want you to be sure that the word of
[1:35:45] God and the spirit of God through the
[1:35:48] word of God
[1:35:51] is the one that dictates what you do and
[1:35:55] where you go
[1:35:58] and everything everything that concerns
[1:36:00] your life because I think you need to
[1:36:02] build it around God because
[1:36:07] Satan and and and I I I want to have it
[1:36:10] right balance. I believe that we you go
[1:36:13] as far as you can go. Study, do whatever
[1:36:16] God wants you to do. What about what
[1:36:19] about your job or what about business or
[1:36:25] just so I get it clear, you know, all
[1:36:27] these great corporations,
[1:36:30] all they are is a structure.
[1:36:35] Whatever it might be, I'll just talk to
[1:36:37] you now for a few minutes.
[1:36:40] Whether it be some big retail
[1:36:41] corporation
[1:36:43] on the US side, the Canadian side,
[1:36:45] corporations period,
[1:36:48] or you work for a certain company and
[1:36:51] and most of you do.
[1:36:54] Just remember one thing
[1:36:57] now a lot of these companies, you know,
[1:36:58] for example, and I'm only saying this
[1:37:00] because it's I want you to see clearly
[1:37:02] what I'm saying. A lot of them are say
[1:37:04] on the stock exchange.
[1:37:06] What are these corporations? What is a
[1:37:09] corporation? A corporation is just a
[1:37:11] it's a paper structure.
[1:37:14] That's all it is. It's not even stone.
[1:37:17] It's not even marble.
[1:37:20] It's not even gold. It's a paper
[1:37:23] structure. And it's got a piece of paper
[1:37:26] says they got so many millions of shares
[1:37:28] and they're on the market and they're $2
[1:37:30] and they're $3 and they're $4 and $5.
[1:37:32] But down here there's people that's
[1:37:33] working
[1:37:35] working for that paper structure.
[1:37:38] And so the paper structure says, you
[1:37:40] know, your job is from 8:00 to 5. Okay,
[1:37:44] fine. Who's told you that? Well, the
[1:37:46] boss. And the Bible says that we serve
[1:37:48] our serve our company. You know, we
[1:37:51] serve our employer with singleness of
[1:37:52] mind, singless of I, which is fine. We
[1:37:55] serve him. So now, but all of our
[1:37:58] activity and then finally, and it's up
[1:38:02] to you. It's not up to me. It's up to
[1:38:03] you. But finally
[1:38:07] a prophet says
[1:38:09] that Satan is the god of this evil age.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, he says education. Now
[1:38:18] that you've got to take it with a
[1:38:20] balance, but he says education is of the
[1:38:21] devil.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Right? Why is he saying that? Is because
[1:38:24] Satan works through that system,
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; that system,
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; and the corporation you work for, it's
[1:38:33] because the corporation has found you a
[1:38:36] talented person and they want to stand
[1:38:40] on top of your shoulders and have you
[1:38:42] serve them so they can make more. Who
[1:38:44] are they? It's just a paper structure.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of people in it, but
[1:38:49] they're all doing the same thing you're
[1:38:51] doing.
[1:38:52] They're all people just serving. And
[1:38:55] finally, Satan because he's the god of
[1:38:57] this thing and he's the god of the
[1:38:59] monetary system.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; He's the god of this present evil age.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Every government is of the devil.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; That won't get me any popularity points,
[1:39:10] but that's what he said. And so that's
[1:39:12] why I have to say that. And why is he
[1:39:14] saying it? Is he saying that we
[1:39:15] shouldn't have a government? That's not
[1:39:17] what he's saying. But it's saying
[1:39:19] clearly that Satan will work through
[1:39:21] that system. Satan will work through the
[1:39:23] government system. Satan will work
[1:39:24] through the econ economic system. Satan
[1:39:27] will work through the uh through the
[1:39:29] educational system. Satan will work
[1:39:31] through it. And you just mark my word
[1:39:33] and see if he doesn't. What he does is
[1:39:35] he begins to engineer things so that
[1:39:39] begins to choke slowly slowly that very
[1:39:43] life and principles of God and he starts
[1:39:46] to encroach and starts to put more
[1:39:48] pressure and starts to twist and it
[1:39:51] might be with your time with God or your
[1:39:53] time with your family or your time with
[1:39:56] the your time for God or your time in
[1:39:58] the your availability to be in the house
[1:40:01] of God at your post of duty and it just
[1:40:03] choke Choke, choke, choke. Slowly,
[1:40:05] slowly, slowly. Because what he's saying
[1:40:08] is, you're going to serve me in this
[1:40:10] system.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; And when you're all done, they'll give
[1:40:13] you a gold watch. Oh, you're a great bus
[1:40:17] driver.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; You're a real smart person. You made the
[1:40:23] company. You made that division go up
[1:40:25] from, you know, 18% to 23% profit. Oh,
[1:40:29] heap all kinds of accolades and put all
[1:40:32] kinds of perks and all the rest of it
[1:40:33] because you did them so good. You got to
[1:40:36] make sure what system you're serving.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; That is the system. And what happens is
[1:40:44] you are you end up help me now as I
[1:40:48] close. You end up serving some master in
[1:40:51] the world that is demanding of your time
[1:40:55] and your energy. and my brother, my
[1:40:58] sister, I pray that you young people get
[1:41:01] a hold of this. So you say, I'm not
[1:41:03] going to expend my youth
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; and my my the beauty of my youth and the
[1:41:09] strength that God has given me. I'm not
[1:41:11] going to expend it just so that some
[1:41:14] corporation or some business or
[1:41:16] something can can uh pride themselves in
[1:41:20] having get so much further advanced. I
[1:41:22] say serve your serve your master with
[1:41:24] singleness of mind and singleness of eye
[1:41:28] and give him eight hours for his eight
[1:41:30] hours. Do whatever is necessary but make
[1:41:32] certain that they don't reach through
[1:41:34] and encroach on your spiritual life on
[1:41:37] your spiritual position. Serve God.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:44] That's why even that's why even the
[1:41:46] apostles, you know, you know, I could
[1:41:48] engage myself and you could be, you
[1:41:50] know, just just visiting the sick or
[1:41:53] marrying the those who want to be
[1:41:55] married and dedicating the babies and
[1:41:58] doing all of those things. That is why
[1:42:01] and a minister can get so occupied.
[1:42:03] you're just counseling and doing this
[1:42:05] and doing that and you find out that
[1:42:07] actually you serve a religious system
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; instead of serving the God that's
[1:42:12] supposed to be in the system.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; I hope that's made some sense to you.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:21] Brother Brandham says I'm going to close
[1:42:24] with a couple statements here.
[1:42:26] Brother Brandham says that he he makes a
[1:42:29] distinction between an organization
[1:42:32] and an organism.
[1:42:35] Said we are an organism. An organization
[1:42:38] is something that is organized a
[1:42:40] business or administrative concern
[1:42:42] united and and constructed for a
[1:42:45] particular end. It's a group of people
[1:42:48] identified by shared interests of
[1:42:50] purposes. An organization. But an
[1:42:53] organism is something that's different.
[1:42:54] It's a functioning system of
[1:42:57] interdependent parts that resembles a
[1:43:00] living creature in structure.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; That's what an organism is. It resembles
[1:43:05] a living structure. It resembles a
[1:43:08] living creature in structure. We are an
[1:43:11] organism.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; And he said, furthermore, if anybody
[1:43:15] says to you, and listen to the church
[1:43:17] now, I want the church to listen to me.
[1:43:19] If anybody says to you that you are a
[1:43:22] denomination or we are a denomination or
[1:43:24] Cloverdale Bible is a denomination, I'm
[1:43:27] going to shock you. Do you know what
[1:43:28] they're saying? You are of the devil.
[1:43:30] Because brother Brandham says
[1:43:32] denomination is of the devil. And if
[1:43:35] anybody, and I defy that, not that I've
[1:43:38] heard it being said, but if anybody
[1:43:39] tried to tell you, oh, they're just
[1:43:40] organization. God is not disorganized.
[1:43:44] He's not disorganized. the heavens and
[1:43:46] all the planets and everything else and
[1:43:47] all the ecosystems the most organized
[1:43:49] thing you can even imagine. God's not
[1:43:51] disorganized, but he's not an
[1:43:53] organization. He puts a system into
[1:43:55] place and when all the pieces are in
[1:43:57] place, he comes down into it himself and
[1:44:00] that's what he did in this hour. There's
[1:44:02] We talk about a rapture, friends. I have
[1:44:04] just so much to say I can't get to it
[1:44:06] all. We talk about a rapture. A rapture
[1:44:09] could not go into place unless
[1:44:10] Revelation 10:1 had happened. A
[1:44:12] revelation couldn't come into place
[1:44:14] until he descended and and came down and
[1:44:17] became part of the body which he had
[1:44:20] created
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; because it takes that before the
[1:44:23] system's complete.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Say it.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what this that's
[1:44:30] what he's been doing as far as I'm
[1:44:32] concerned. That's exactly what he's been
[1:44:34] doing. But I in this hour we want to be
[1:44:37] so alert and and I I would say to you,
[1:44:40] you just take control. Take control of
[1:44:43] your life. Take control of your home and
[1:44:45] your family under God. I take control
[1:44:48] for the glory of God. My home, my
[1:44:51] family, my life, the church. We're here
[1:44:54] to glorify God and the purpose of God.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm thrilled this morning
[1:44:58] that I could make this announcement,
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; the free word announcement.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:04] This last weekend, we had a brother
[1:45:07] standing here, a brother Derek
[1:45:08] Donelsson, a precious brother, and I
[1:45:10] never knew over the 20 or 25 years that
[1:45:12] I've known him. We haven't spent that
[1:45:14] much time together, but I never knew
[1:45:17] that he came to be the man he is and the
[1:45:20] minister that he is because he a book
[1:45:22] fell into his hand, things that are to
[1:45:24] be. And I can tell you there are people
[1:45:27] throughout the world who who are craving
[1:45:30] and there there's something within them
[1:45:31] that's craving for a word that they
[1:45:34] haven't heard yet.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; And I pray that God somehow through this
[1:45:38] means and bless whoever the brothers are
[1:45:41] that God somehow will get a word get a
[1:45:44] word and they'll read it on their screen
[1:45:46] or whatever more something that will
[1:45:48] change their lives forever.
[1:45:50] Brother Donson had been through he'd
[1:45:52] been brought up right. He'd been through
[1:45:54] Bible school, but he hadn't never heard
[1:45:56] this.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; And when he heard that out of things
[1:45:59] that are to be, and I just said this
[1:46:01] morning to myself, if God can take one
[1:46:03] message book and make a man who've been
[1:46:05] out of Bible school hungering for God
[1:46:08] and transform him into what we heard
[1:46:09] this last weekend, I say, "Oh, God,
[1:46:12] there's got to be somebody else out
[1:46:13] here. There's got to be somebody. send
[1:46:15] this word with a mighty voice
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; and let you and I do everything we can
[1:46:21] to propagate it and to push it and to
[1:46:24] get that last because what does the
[1:46:25] prophet say? We use these phrases
[1:46:27] friends sometime. I don't think we
[1:46:29] understand what they mean. And he says,
[1:46:31] "When the last elected seed
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; comes in, we're going home." In the
[1:46:38] light of my message this morning, what's
[1:46:39] he saying? When the last one is put in
[1:46:42] place, when the last one comes in to
[1:46:45] where they're supposed to be, the system
[1:46:48] will be complete.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; The system will be complete. the body
[1:46:55] will be complete.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to be in there. I want to be
[1:47:00] part of that by his grace. I don't want
[1:47:02] to be hanging on the outside. I don't
[1:47:04] want to be a hitchhiker. I don't want to
[1:47:05] be in a onlooker. I want to be part of
[1:47:08] that body. Oh God, hear my prayer even
[1:47:10] now while I preach. I want to be part of
[1:47:12] that body.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; And by his grace, I expect to be.
[1:47:19] I'd say with the Apostle Paul, even
[1:47:21] after ministering, I wouldn't want to be
[1:47:22] a cast away. I wouldn't want to just
[1:47:25] serve the system and just serve the
[1:47:27] needs of the people and just serve and
[1:47:29] serve and serve. I tell you what, I want
[1:47:31] to have God in the midst of this
[1:47:32] congregation. God in the midst of my
[1:47:35] life.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; May God bless you.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; We are not a denomination.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; We are an organism. Amen.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; We're a living creature
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; created by God himself
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; for his divine purpose and he has come
[1:47:54] down amongst us.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; How happy I am.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Pray with me. Father, as we respectfully
[1:48:06] and reverently bow our heads
[1:48:09] thinking on this great subject, Lord,
[1:48:13] and what it is you wanted said. And I
[1:48:15] pray, Father, that the words were fitted
[1:48:18] to every heart. And you've been speaking
[1:48:21] to my own heart, Lord. And I say, "Draw
[1:48:24] me nearer. Draw me nearer." And I
[1:48:27] believe this is uh also what rings in
[1:48:30] the true in the hearts of so many here.
[1:48:32] And I trust all of us. Draw us nearer,
[1:48:36] God. Whatever it is that you desire to
[1:48:38] do, whatever kind of a group of people
[1:48:40] you desire to have, whatever would make
[1:48:43] you pleased, I pray that you'll move
[1:48:45] amongst us, Lord. And I pray you'll move
[1:48:48] out every every hindrance, Lord. I
[1:48:50] wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to be
[1:48:52] the one I and Lord, I don't want to be
[1:48:54] one that would hinder you in any way. I
[1:48:57] pray that you'll come and move amongst
[1:48:58] us. And there's anything in my own
[1:49:00] heart, move it out, oh God, take it out
[1:49:02] from me, Father. I pray in the name of
[1:49:05] Jesus Christ that you'll just bring the
[1:49:07] body of the body of Jesus Christ, this
[1:49:10] body, this part of it here. Bring us, oh
[1:49:13] Lord, into such a oneness, a one mind
[1:49:16] and one spirit, oh God, and one purpose.
[1:49:22] Let the people see. Father, I pray that
[1:49:24] you'll give them an understanding of
[1:49:26] what truly has been in my heart and how
[1:49:29] I yearn, oh God, to see the word go so
[1:49:33] far to see it go as quickly as it can.
[1:49:36] Lord, that the last elected seed may
[1:49:39] come in. And oh God, I pray that you'll
[1:49:42] bless your work wherever it might be
[1:49:44] throughout the earth. and all who put
[1:49:46] their shoulder to the wheel and all who
[1:49:49] give and all, oh God, who expend
[1:49:52] themselves. I pray you'll bless them.
[1:49:55] And Father,
[1:49:57] God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; you have ordained that you shall have a
[1:50:03] people. You've ordained that you shall
[1:50:05] have a family. God of eternity, God of
[1:50:09] the universe,
[1:50:11] God and creator of every good thing. I
[1:50:15] pray that you'll take this congregation,
[1:50:17] Lord. We're just passing through this
[1:50:19] way.
[1:50:22] Just once, just once.
[1:50:26] We want to, Father, use every ounce of
[1:50:30] energy and every ounce of strength that
[1:50:32] you give us that we might serve you, oh
[1:50:36] God.
[1:50:37] I pray that you will
[1:50:40] show each one in their own place, Lord.
[1:50:44] in their own little realm, their own
[1:50:46] circle of activity.
[1:50:51] May they live, oh God. And I ask that
[1:50:54] each one will, wherever they are, will
[1:50:56] live such a godly life and you'll be
[1:51:00] pleased that you'll walk with them and
[1:51:02] it'll make their the system of their
[1:51:05] spiritual life complete. And then on
[1:51:08] that day, Lord,
[1:51:12] on that day, this afternoon,
[1:51:15] no doubt,
[1:51:17] we'll be with different ones and family
[1:51:20] and friends.
[1:51:22] They'll take on some nourishment, have
[1:51:23] some fellowship.
[1:51:26] But we we would miss today, but we don't
[1:51:30] want to miss on that day when the
[1:51:32] marriage supper is called and we come
[1:51:35] and gather at that table.
[1:51:39] And the prophet says the king will come
[1:51:41] out
[1:51:43] and the tears of joy that will flow down
[1:51:45] our faces
[1:51:47] and as we look across the table and see
[1:51:49] one another. Lord, I I want to be able
[1:51:52] to look across the table. I I I believe
[1:51:55] that by predestination, by elective
[1:51:57] love, you have ordained a place for each
[1:52:00] one of us to say it. May we make our
[1:52:03] calling and election sure.
[1:52:06] I pray, oh God, if there's anything that
[1:52:08] is un displeasing and unpleasant to you,
[1:52:12] that we will rid it out of our lives.
[1:52:14] Bring the Holy Spirit down amongst us,
[1:52:16] oh God, today in the name of Jesus
[1:52:19] Christ, we ask it. Amen.
[1:52:24] Hallelujah. 2119. If you would hear the
[1:52:29] cries. Let's stand, shall we?
[1:52:32] Kept you a little long, but I didn't
[1:52:34] want to go into the subject again.
[1:52:38] Amen. How many are happy for the word?
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:52:45] Hear the cries
[1:52:48] of the shackle
[1:52:50] from the onset.
[1:52:53] of time
[1:52:55] for the change
[1:52:57] of defend
[1:53:01] [Music]
[1:53:05] [Applause]
[1:53:08] the cry
[1:53:11] of the slave.
[1:53:13] Is there no one
[1:53:16] worthy to set us free?
[1:53:22] Then the crying
[1:53:24] is still
[1:53:26] as the chorus
[1:53:28] rings out.
[1:53:31] The shackle
[1:53:33] released from their chain
[1:53:39] and thousands
[1:53:42] of horses
[1:53:44] are swelling
[1:53:46] the song.
[1:53:49] Worthy
[1:53:51] the lamb that was made.
[1:53:58] Worthy
[1:54:02] worthy,
[1:54:04] worthy,
[1:54:06] worthy.
[1:54:08] The lamb
[1:54:10] that was slain.
[1:54:12] [Music]
[1:54:15] He's worthy.
[1:54:19] So worthy,
[1:54:21] [Music]
[1:54:24] worthy.
[1:54:26] The lamb
[1:54:28] that was slain.
[1:54:33] All the archangels,
[1:54:37] the saints of all time,
[1:54:42] holding
[1:54:44] the ground in their hands.
[1:54:51] Fall down
[1:54:53] before him,
[1:54:55] joining
[1:54:57] the song.
[1:54:59] worthy
[1:55:01] of
[1:55:03] the lamb.
[1:55:08] He's worthy.

[1:55:36] The lamb
[1:55:38] that was slain.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; I'm going to sing that first verse
[1:55:44] again, and I'll tell you why. I was one
[1:55:46] of those.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; I was one that was shackled. I sat on a
[1:55:50] log with a prophet sitting no more than
[1:55:53] 12 inches away.
[1:55:56] I was so shackled
[1:55:59] and there I had been shackled for years.
[1:56:02] I've been shackled by absolute utter
[1:56:05] confusion.
[1:56:07] I had heard good men, good preachers,
[1:56:10] men I love, men I respected and had this
[1:56:14] thought and some had that thought. God
[1:56:16] is one and God is two and God is three
[1:56:18] and you baptize this way and you b How
[1:56:20] can I go on through life? How can I go
[1:56:22] on as a minister? How can I go on stand
[1:56:25] behind a pulpit and not even know who
[1:56:27] I'm talking about? You talk about
[1:56:29] shackled. And there's nobody, nobody
[1:56:33] that I had was able to even be with that
[1:56:37] could seem to give me an answer for
[1:56:41] these momentous things.
[1:56:46] What What would you do if you were in
[1:56:47] that state this morning? Just tossed to
[1:56:50] and fro and full of confusion. Wouldn't
[1:56:53] it be a terrible state to be in? How
[1:56:55] thankful we are. We have an absolute
[1:56:58] Hallelujah.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, we have an absolute friend.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; And I was shackled. And that's why I
[1:57:05] love this song. I was one of those. And
[1:57:08] I sat there to You say, "What set you
[1:57:09] free?" It wasn't some great feeling. It
[1:57:12] wasn't some great excitement. But when
[1:57:14] the word started to come out of that
[1:57:15] mouth, that word came out, one, two,
[1:57:18] three, four scriptures and my shackles
[1:57:20] were broken
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; forever.
[1:57:25] That is why I know one person can get
[1:57:27] just one message book in their hand if
[1:57:30] they will do it. And and I listened
[1:57:32] carefully.
[1:57:34] My heart was so long, so hungry and I so
[1:57:38] absorbed every word. Do you know the
[1:57:40] scripture said, "Do you know what is the
[1:57:42] rain that falls on the just and the
[1:57:44] unjust? I'm so absorbing. I'm looking
[1:57:46] right into his eyes." Tell you friends,
[1:57:48] that's what we need to be. Be right on
[1:57:50] the tip of our toes, right on the front
[1:57:52] of your seat. say, "Oh, God, you got
[1:57:53] something in this service for me. I'm
[1:57:55] coming back tonight. I'm going to hear
[1:57:57] something from my brother John Andy's. I
[1:57:59] believe God's given him something that I
[1:58:01] will have."
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; That's the way I live, friends.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; That's why we get impacted by these
[1:58:10] things. Hear the hear the voice of the
[1:58:12] shackle. And I hear them. And I pray, oh
[1:58:16] God, he'll send this message with a
[1:58:18] mighty voice. As far as Oh, for my part.
[1:58:22] Let the last one come in and let us go
[1:58:24] home.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Hear the cries
[1:58:29] of the shackles
[1:58:34] of time.
[1:58:39] on the feet. There's no
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; no king
[1:58:46] the tears
[1:58:48] of the broken
[1:58:51] and the cries
[1:58:53] of the slaves.
[1:58:56] There's no one
[1:58:58] worthy to set us free.
[1:59:02] I'm blessing this next line of
[1:59:06] [Applause]
[1:59:07] is still
[1:59:10] the chlores
[1:59:12] [Music]
[1:59:20] [Applause]
[1:59:26] of voices
[1:59:28] are
[1:59:30] the song
[1:59:33] worthy
[1:59:35] [Applause]
[1:59:38] Then all the archangels and all the
[1:59:40] archangels and all the archangels
[1:59:46] and the saints
[1:59:49] of all time
[1:59:54] [Music]
[1:59:56] [Applause]
[1:59:57] [Music]
[1:59:58] [Applause]
[2:00:00] they fall
[2:00:03] before him enjoying
[2:00:07] the song.
[2:00:10] Worthy,
[2:00:12] worthy
[2:00:14] of

[2:00:33] that was slain.

[2:00:37] So worthy,
[2:00:41] worthy,
[2:00:43] worthy,
[2:00:45] worthy,
[2:00:48] worthy.
[2:00:50] The lamb
[2:00:52] that was slain.
[2:00:56] And may this Holy Spirit,
[2:00:59] our Lord Jesus Christ, come amongst us.
[2:01:03] And I pray that he'll
[2:01:05] be our guide. Help each one finding
[2:01:08] their balance. But may we
[2:01:12] may we put the pressure on the world,
[2:01:13] friends. May we put the pressure on the
[2:01:16] system. May we squeeze more time out of
[2:01:19] it so we can give it to God. May we
[2:01:21] squeeze time out of this world.
[2:01:23] Hallelujah.
[2:01:25] Lord,
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; just give it to Christ. Give it to him.
[2:01:29] Oh God, I pray you'll grant it. Wonder
[2:01:32] Brother DJ, if you'll come please and
[2:01:35] dismiss us in prayer and may we go under
[2:01:37] this atmosphere today is my prayer. If
[2:01:41] you're not, if you're here and you are
[2:01:42] not have received that kind of peace,
[2:01:47] it's here. It's available for you. We
[2:01:49] didn't preach this in vain. We preached
[2:01:51] it that you may have it in the name of
[2:01:54] Jesus Christ. Brother diddy please.
[2:02:00] Father, we
[2:02:03] have been spoken to this morning
[2:02:06] and our hearts are thankful. Dear God,
[2:02:10] we realize that without you, we are
[2:02:12] nothing. Oh God,
[2:02:15] it shows us that we need more of you
[2:02:17] every day. Father, Lord, let this word
[2:02:20] that has gone forth find a beding ground
[2:02:22] into our souls to bring forth, Father,
[2:02:25] the kind of reaction you desire for it
[2:02:27] to be. Oh God, we want you to be the
[2:02:30] centerfold, oh God, of every life that
[2:02:33] is here. That's the purpose why you have
[2:02:35] gathered us this morning and directed
[2:02:37] the word in this way, Father, for us to
[2:02:40] realize that the system can't work
[2:02:43] outside of you, the great creator,
[2:02:45] Father. So we pray that every life will
[2:02:47] find that portion this morning. Lord,
[2:02:51] for us, oh God, that are hungry and
[2:02:53] thirsty, Father, we believe you gave us
[2:02:55] a promise that we shall be filled. Oh
[2:02:57] God, we want more of you, Father. And
[2:03:00] for those who have not experienced this
[2:03:02] liberating influence, Father, the
[2:03:04] shackle being broken, oh God, let our
[2:03:07] word accomplish that this morning,
[2:03:09] Father, we believe that it has not been
[2:03:11] sent in vain, but with an express
[2:03:13] purpose. Oh God, we believe it will send
[2:03:16] as a guided missile to find the places
[2:03:19] where it has need in every life today.
[2:03:21] We ask oh God that your word will have
[2:03:24] that influence oh God will have that
[2:03:26] effect that impact their God that it'll
[2:03:29] be a change a transformation that it'll
[2:03:31] become oh God a reality for every
[2:03:34] believer every attentive here that have
[2:03:37] set to listen this morning. Would you
[2:03:39] bless them, oh God, that he'll go from
[2:03:41] the heads into the soul where it can be
[2:03:44] turned into a living reality? That's our
[2:03:46] prayer today, oh God. Bless your
[2:03:49] servant, Father, watching him just
[2:03:51] giving his best. We pray that you'll
[2:03:53] renew him this morning. And for the
[2:03:56] service tonight, we believe that the
[2:03:58] same God, Father, that has moved among
[2:04:00] us this morning will come again for a
[2:04:03] double portion. Father, we expect
[2:04:05] greater things from you, oh God. We put
[2:04:07] no limits to what you can do. You're the
[2:04:10] great the great God of limitless power.
[2:04:13] So continue to deal with us, Father. Let
[2:04:16] your word be the meditation of our
[2:04:18] hearts. Let it as let it not be
[2:04:21] forgotten, God, but let it be, Father,
[2:04:23] the center of our fellowship that you
[2:04:26] will draw closer to us. That's our
[2:04:28] request, Father. We commit everything to
[2:04:31] you and we thank you for the day in
[2:04:34] Jesus name. Amen.
[2:04:38] Thank you, brother DJ. Say God bless you
[2:04:40] and we'll dismiss you. It's carried a
[2:04:43] little longer this morning than we
[2:04:45] really wanted to, but God bless you. I
[2:04:46] trust you
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; that will be anchored in your heart.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're dismissed in Jesus name.
