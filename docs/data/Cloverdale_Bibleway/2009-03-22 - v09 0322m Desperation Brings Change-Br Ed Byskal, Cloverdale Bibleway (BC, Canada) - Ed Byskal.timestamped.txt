[16:20] Amen.
[16:22] Got a couple of requests here this
[16:24] morning we want to pray over. Um,
[16:26] brother Ricardo has a a request for a
[16:30] friend um,
[16:32] uh, the name of Gabe who called this
[16:34] morning, asked for prayer for his wife,
[16:36] Anna, and she just I won't go into all
[16:38] the symptoms, but she's just very sick
[16:40] and she needs a touch from the Lord.
[16:43] Amen. So, want to remember her this
[16:44] morning. We also uh want to uh remember
[16:49] this morning um a couple in brother Dan
[16:52] Olsen's church back east. uh sister
[16:55] Cheryl and brother Matthew um I was
[16:59] Malloy Milot
[17:01] um their daughter six-year-old daughter
[17:04] passed away in the bathtub uh last week.
[17:07] So we want to pray this morning for that
[17:10] family. And if you've got a need this
[17:12] morning, whatever it would be, just lift
[17:15] your hand. Amen. And if you're listening
[17:17] in on the internet, you've got a need
[17:18] this morning, you just
[17:21] ask um the Lord this morning for
[17:24] whatever that need would be. He sees our
[17:26] needs even before we ask, saints. He
[17:28] knows what we need. So, let's just come
[17:30] before him this morning. Amen. Brother
[17:32] John.
[17:37] Lord, we have a desire to worship you
[17:39] this morning, God.
[17:41] something in our souls is just wanting
[17:44] to lift up our hearts, God, and lift up
[17:47] our hands, Lord. These are the hands
[17:49] you've given us. And we want to praise
[17:50] you this morning,
[17:52] Lord. These songs that we've sang, many
[17:55] of the world might sing those same
[17:57] songs, but there must be something
[17:59] different in your heart when the bride
[18:01] begins to lift up their voices, begins
[18:04] to lift up their hearts and sing the
[18:06] same words. It's coming from another
[18:09] person, coming from another group of
[18:11] people because the bride is now coming
[18:14] to your throne and lifting up our
[18:16] hearts. We're lifting up our mouths, our
[18:19] voices, and saying, "Thank you, Jesus,
[18:22] and hallelujah. We thank you, Lord. It
[18:24] must do something to you, Lord, to hear
[18:27] our lives echoing back your word that we
[18:30] thank you, Lord, and we love you and you
[18:33] are more than life to us, Lord. You're
[18:36] everything to us. As the song said, you
[18:39] are more than life to us. You are our
[18:42] life, Lord. You are our satisfaction.
[18:45] You are our joy when we see you, Lord.
[18:48] When we see your face. And even this
[18:51] morning as our brother Rod being so
[18:53] sensitive to your spirit. We also want
[18:56] to be sensitive as worshippers, Lord. We
[18:59] want to come humbly. We want to come
[19:01] thanking you, Lord. and this unthankful
[19:04] generation. We want to be mindful of all
[19:07] your benefits. Lord, for your grace that
[19:10] is sufficient, for your mercies that are
[19:13] new every morning, for health within our
[19:15] bodies, for the Holy Ghost, for a
[19:18] prophet that's come with a message, for
[19:21] a heart that would receive, for a heart
[19:23] that's been turned back. We say, "Thank
[19:26] you, Jesus.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Let our voices, Lord, ring into the
[19:30] eternities. We were once were lost and
[19:33] we are found. We were once beggars, but
[19:37] you've made us your wife. You've made us
[19:39] the queen of heaven. We want to say
[19:42] thank you, Lord, for that today.
[19:45] We were once sick, Lord, and by your
[19:48] stripes, you've made us well. And even
[19:50] this morning, there's needs in the body.
[19:53] And we just pray for them today. Hands
[19:55] are up all over the building, God.
[19:58] this need that's come in through our
[20:00] brother Ricardo and I need you today
[20:03] Lord. So many circumstances and
[20:06] situations,
[20:08] issues in individuals lives, but Lord,
[20:11] if we could just touch the hem of your
[20:13] garment, all the years and all the
[20:15] issues and all the things could be dealt
[20:18] with just in a stroke of your hand, God.
[20:21] And this family that's lost their child,
[20:24] be with them today, Lord. So many things
[20:27] around the circumstances, but you know
[20:29] all things,
[20:32] Lord. And you know our lives today. You
[20:34] know the needs that are unspoken all
[20:37] through the building on the internet.
[20:39] Lord, our hearts are standing in silent
[20:42] adoration.
[20:43] That you know all things. You're Jehovah
[20:47] Gyra. Even before we came to this
[20:49] meeting and offered up our lives, you
[20:52] were ready to consume us, Lord. So would
[20:54] you consume every life here today, Lord?
[20:58] Consume our faith that comes before you
[21:00] like an older. We're asking for the
[21:03] rapture cycle, that catching away, for
[21:06] that faith to come upon this
[21:08] congregation today that you would anoint
[21:10] our pastor to speak words of life, words
[21:13] of truth, come to the heart of the
[21:16] matter. Lord, I pray that we would lay
[21:18] aside all the outside things, all the
[21:22] peripheral things, all of our thoughts,
[21:24] Lord, that as we come to worship you in
[21:27] spirit and in truth, that you would be
[21:29] able to come to the soul, blessed Jesus,
[21:32] our Lord, come to our hearts today. And
[21:36] may you do the supernatural. Our hands
[21:38] are lifted up and we're asking for the
[21:40] supernatural to break out upon us, God.
[21:44] Even yet, while we hear the word, you
[21:46] that unseen one would walk up and down
[21:48] these aisles, God, into the nursery,
[21:51] into the fellowship hall, out across the
[21:54] internet waves, on the phone hookup,
[21:56] God, nothing is too great for you.
[22:00] Nothing is too small for you. You know
[22:03] the secrets of our hearts, and we're
[22:05] just quivering. We're just waiting on
[22:07] your appearing, Lord. We love your
[22:09] appearing, God.
[22:12] Oh Jesus, that you would come and feel
[22:14] so welcome. That we would kiss your feet
[22:17] and wash them with our tears. Lord, I
[22:20] pray that there would be something from
[22:22] our heart well up, Lord, that we would
[22:25] love you and receive you and that your
[22:29] word would be precious to us today.
[22:31] Bless this whole day, our brother Jason
[22:33] that is visiting, God, and you would
[22:35] speak through tonight and our pastor
[22:37] this morning. May you just go out today
[22:39] and minister to our souls. And may we
[22:42] minister back to you, Lord, by loving
[22:46] you and believing every word. We take it
[22:49] into our hearts, Lord, and we receive it
[22:52] in Jesus name. Amen.
[23:01] Amen. You can have your seats.
[23:04] [Music]
[23:17] Want to welcome all those who are
[23:19] visiting with us this morning. Good to
[23:21] have a Colossus with us from Calgary.
[23:25] Always
[23:28] appreciate
[23:30] fellowshipping with song leaders.
[23:38] Um, one announcement. There's a young
[23:40] people's meeting this Friday night,
[23:42] March the 27th at uh the church here at
[23:46] 7:30. Young people's meeting this Friday
[23:49] night, March 27th.
[23:52] I want to be praying for that. Um, we
[23:54] have a baby dedication here this
[23:56] morning. Brother David and Sister Jana
[23:58] Walner are going to bring their little
[23:59] one. So, while they come, let's sing
[24:01] together. Jesus loves me. This I know
[24:04] for the Bible tells me so. Aren't you
[24:06] glad? Amen.
[24:10] Jesus loves me, this I know.
[24:15] For the Bible
[24:18] tells me so.
[24:21] Little ones to him belong.
[24:26] They are weak, but he is strong.
[24:31] Yes, Jesus loves me.
[24:36] Yes, Jesus loves me.
[24:41] Yes, Jesus loves me.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; Isn't this wonderful?
[24:56] &gt;&gt; Be able to have our families raised up
[24:57] in the presence of God as a wonderful
[25:00] heritage. And this is uh Sister Rebecca
[25:03] an this morning. She was born in August
[25:06] of last year.
[25:09] And it's so wonderful when you have
[25:10] brother David and Sister Jana uh having
[25:14] in their hearts to have their children
[25:16] raised and to have them named after uh
[25:21] sisters in the scripture where they have
[25:23] some meaning and some substance. Isn't
[25:25] that wonderful?
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Rebecca wasn't named after a movie star
[25:28] or an actress. She was named after
[25:32] Rebecca in the scripture.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; We all know Isaac and what a wonderful
[25:36] uh relationship and the supernatural
[25:38] that just surrounded their lives. And
[25:41] Rebecca means to bind or to tie.
[25:45] And her middle name an
[25:49] means favored grace. Favored grace. And
[25:53] how that Rebecca to bind or to tie. We
[25:57] just pray for Rebecca that there would
[25:58] be a a tying and a binding in her heart
[26:01] to favor grace.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; And there was something, brother David
[26:05] and Sister Jana, I just uh fell to my
[26:07] heart
[26:09] when I was reading uh this week in Job.
[26:12] It came to my heart and how that when
[26:15] Job was going through his time of of
[26:17] testing
[26:20] actually disaster, brother Brandham
[26:22] called it when it struck their home and
[26:25] how that
[26:27] the children was all killed and all of
[26:29] uh Job's substance. He was a mighty uh
[26:32] man. And the in the Bible says in Job
[26:34] chapter 1 that he was uh one of the
[26:36] greatest of all the men of the east and
[26:38] how when it came and struck all of his
[26:40] household, his uh sheep, his camels, his
[26:44] oxen and asses as a great household and
[26:47] how it killed even his children.
[26:50] And brother Brandham spoke about that. I
[26:52] I just felt to speak about these things
[26:54] about Job because brother Brandham said
[26:57] God wasn't rebuking Job. He was only
[27:00] purging Job. And he said God had
[27:03] confidence in Job
[27:05] &gt;&gt; and he knew that Job could trust him.
[27:09] And so, Brother Benham spoke about how
[27:12] that when Satan came and God said, "All
[27:14] right, Satan, you go on. He's at your
[27:16] hands, but don't take his life. You can
[27:18] do anything else to him." So, Satan good
[27:21] at his office. Away he goes and he kills
[27:25] all of Job's children. Satan did. And
[27:29] brother Benham said, "I want you to
[27:31] notice a little thing.
[27:33] You remember the last book of Job and
[27:35] how he had all of his oxmen and camels
[27:38] and sheep, they were all restored
[27:40] doublefold." And the last chapter of of
[27:43] Job, you can read that how he was but
[27:46] his children, he had seven sons and
[27:48] three daughters. His children was
[27:50] restored.
[27:52] And brother Brandham said this, God
[27:54] began to restore back to Job. He
[27:56] restored his stock, his animals and
[27:59] livestock and everything double. But did
[28:02] you notice about his children? God
[28:05] restored back Job's children. It didn't
[28:08] say he doubled them, but he restored
[28:11] them to him. And and brother Bam said,
[28:14] "I wonder where they were at." Did you
[28:16] ever take a thought of that and read the
[28:17] book of Job? They were in glory waiting
[28:20] for for him because he had offered a
[28:23] sacrifice under the shed blood.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; God remembered Job's children. And this
[28:30] thought came to me uh brother David and
[28:32] Sister Jana
[28:34] and how that there's something about
[28:36] restoration and redemption in God's
[28:38] heart for special thoughts about our
[28:42] children. And brother Brandham said they
[28:45] were waiting in glory waiting for him
[28:48] because he had offered a sacrifice under
[28:50] the shed blood. And he knowed where they
[28:52] were waiting for him at under the shed
[28:54] blood.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; And he never said he'd give back another
[28:57] bunch of children. But he restored Job's
[29:01] children to him because they were
[29:03] waiting for him under the shed blood of
[29:06] the sacrifice.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; And I was thinking of the power of the
[29:10] blood of bulls and goats. And this is
[29:12] for Rebecca Anna. If the power of the
[29:15] blood of bulls and goats could have that
[29:18] much kind of an effect in Job's family,
[29:21] what can the power of the token
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; in David's life and Janna's life and
[29:26] Jordan and Levi for Rebecca to be able
[29:29] to have an atmosphere and environment
[29:31] that Rebecca can be brought up in of the
[29:34] token life.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. and that God can restore and give
[29:37] to Rebecca that atmosphere and
[29:39] environment that when she comes of age
[29:42] that there would be something in her
[29:44] that would love Jesus Christ. Let's
[29:47] dedicate her to the Lord today.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together.
[29:59] Lord, you're so wonderful to Brother
[30:02] David and Sister Jan and Lori to give
[30:04] them this child.
[30:06] You gave them Jordan and Levi, and now
[30:09] you've blessed their home with a lovely
[30:12] girl, Rebecca Anne, a tie that binds,
[30:16] something that that holds to a grace, a
[30:19] favored grace. this Waldner family, such
[30:22] a rich heritage. And we want to thank
[30:25] you for that, God, today. And Lord, if
[30:28] you can restore Job's children, seven
[30:32] sons and three daughters, surely you can
[30:35] hold this child in the palm of your hand
[30:38] under the power of the token under the
[30:40] blood of Jesus Christ that was shed for
[30:43] Rebecca, for her parents that love you
[30:46] and love this message. And this token
[30:49] was for the end time. and they've given
[30:51] their lives to you, Rebecca and Jana,
[30:54] and now they desire to give Rebecca back
[30:56] to you today. I pray that you would
[30:59] bless this child, bless her with health,
[31:02] bless her, bless her, God, with a sound
[31:04] mind and Lord, the atmosphere in her
[31:07] home, Sister Jan and Brother David, that
[31:09] you would just give them grace and
[31:11] leadership and the mind of Christ and
[31:14] watch over this little child, her soul,
[31:17] her spirit, and her body. that is so
[31:19] wonderful to you. We dedicate her to you
[31:23] today, Father, and just pray that the
[31:26] presence of God would be her portion.
[31:28] and that you would walk with her and
[31:30] talk with her. That even at a young age
[31:33] when she begins to sense your presence
[31:35] in her life, even in the services and in
[31:38] her home, that there would be a
[31:40] tenderness and a softness that there
[31:42] would be something towards you, God, at
[31:44] an early time in her youth, that she
[31:47] would seek your face and that she would
[31:49] give her heart to you. Lord, we dedicate
[31:52] Rebecca an to you this morning and pray
[31:55] that your blessing would be upon her
[31:56] life in the name of Jesus Christ.
[32:00] Amen.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:17] Thanks, brother John. We have a
[32:21] song from the senior choir they're going
[32:23] to sing for us this morning. Maybe they
[32:24] can come as we sing together. Jesus,
[32:26] draw me close, closer, Lord, to you.
[32:32] Jesus, draw me close.
[32:39] Closer Lord to you.
[32:46] Let the world around me
[32:51] fade away.
[32:58] Oh Jesus is drawing closeer
[33:07] Lord to you.

[34:07] when I don't know the way.
[34:13] Each turn is so uncertain.
[34:19] I've learned to walk by faith.
[34:24] Lord, you gave me a promise
[34:30] that you would never leave.

[38:14] together. if they could put it up on the
[38:15] screen. Is that your desire to be led of
[38:18] the Lord?
[38:19] [Music]

[40:35] Oh, once again, just leave me.
[40:41] I will
[40:46] leave.
[40:49] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[41:02] Leave me alone.
[41:06] I will.
[41:10] Let's just sing it once again while the
[41:11] choir takes their seats. Lead me.
[41:17] [Music]
[41:26] Heat. Heat.
[41:39] [Music]
[41:41] Oh,
[41:46] &gt;&gt; let's just close our eyes and say it
[41:48] again.
[41:57] [Music]
[42:02] I will
[42:07] show you.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; You have called me Lord and I will
[42:13] answer.
[42:14] [Music]
[42:23] With our heads bowed,
[42:26] we say to you, Almighty God,
[42:29] shepherd of Israel, you are our
[42:32] shepherd,
[42:34] the shepherd that goes before the sheep
[42:37] that leads them into green, shady
[42:39] pastures and besides cool waters. And
[42:44] Lord, I'm absolutely convinced that we
[42:47] gathered here this morning needing to
[42:51] come into green pastures,
[42:54] needing a drink from the fountain of
[42:57] God. Oh, Holy Spirit, I pray that you
[43:01] will gently lead us on. And as we have
[43:05] sung in prayerfully, lead me Lord and I
[43:09] will follow. Now take your word for you
[43:13] are that word. Cause my lips to speak
[43:18] that very sentence and that very phrase
[43:22] that will penetrate to the inner being
[43:26] of each individual. Oh God, those that
[43:29] may be in special need, I pray your word
[43:32] will go and meet that need. Whatever it
[43:35] might be, physical or mental or material
[43:38] or especially spiritual, lead us, Lord
[43:42] Jesus. Lead us. Lead me as I stand here
[43:46] at the post of duty. And I pray, Father,
[43:49] that your word and your presence will
[43:53] emphasize
[43:55] this service. Lord, pray, oh God, that
[43:58] you will take our brother Jason Jackson
[44:00] for this evening and prepare him. Lord,
[44:04] prepare our hearts, oh God, for this
[44:07] service. How we thank you that our paths
[44:10] have crossed. And I pray that you will
[44:12] not only make him a great blessing, but
[44:14] make us to be a blessing to him in Jesus
[44:18] Christ's name. Now, may the author come
[44:22] and open the word and interpret it to
[44:25] each heart in Jesus' name. Amen. Isn't
[44:29] it wonderful? We can commit our lives in
[44:31] this time to him. God bless you. If
[44:34] you'd like to take your Bibles,
[44:37] I'll have you turn to the prophet
[44:39] Jeremiah, the 29th chapter.
[44:43] We'll read a few verses.
[44:52] The chapter just previous prior to the
[44:56] 29th chapter
[44:58] is one in which uh Haniah who was also
[45:03] called a prophet prophesied in detail
[45:07] that the that the children of Israel
[45:10] would only be two years in Babylonian
[45:13] bondage. And he was very specific about
[45:16] it and did different signs and took the
[45:19] yoke and broke the yoke and and uh uh
[45:23] Jeremiah standing there and Jeremiah,
[45:27] you know, said amen.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; If that's uh you know, if that's the
[45:32] word of the Lord, he'd say amen to it.
[45:35] And uh uh so he wasn't in in opposition
[45:39] to it in that in in that way. He didn't
[45:43] uh he didn't become argumentative
[45:45] but he just said amen. And uh but then
[45:50] he spoke
[45:52] uh the word of God again. He because God
[45:55] didn't change his mind about his word
[45:56] and he spoke it again and told him it
[46:00] would be 70 years and then told Haniah
[46:02] that he would also die. So we find that
[46:06] in the previous chapter Haniah who had
[46:09] prophesied called him a prophet. He died
[46:11] and his prophecy died with him.
[46:15] Then we come into the 29th chapter
[46:18] and Jeremiah is
[46:21] uh reconfirming what God has said. And
[46:23] I'm going to
[46:26] uh begin at the 10th verse.
[46:29] For thus saith the Lord, that that after
[46:33] 70 years be accomplished at Babylon, I
[46:36] will visit you and perform my good word
[46:39] toward you in causing you to return to
[46:42] this place. For I know the thoughts that
[46:45] I think toward you, sayeth the Lord,
[46:48] thoughts of peace and not of evil, to
[46:51] give you an expected end. Then shall you
[46:56] call upon me, and you shall go and pray
[46:59] unto me, and I will hearken unto you,
[47:03] and you shall seek me and find me, when
[47:08] you shall search for me with all your
[47:11] heart.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; I'll read one verse in Luke the 16th
[47:17] chapter,
[47:19] uh if you'd like to turn to it. It's a
[47:22] very short verse.
[47:24] It's the 16th verse of the 16th chapter.
[47:35] For the law and the prophets were until
[47:38] John. And since that time the kingdom of
[47:41] God is preached,
[47:44] &gt;&gt; and how many men?
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Every man presseth into it.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. May God bless the word to
[47:52] us. As you have your seats,
[47:55] we want to greet everyone that is
[47:58] streaming in the other lands, other
[48:00] countries, wherever you might be or
[48:02] whatever time of the day or night it
[48:04] might be. But we just say God bless them
[48:08] as well. And may they receive what uh
[48:12] the Lord has intended for them. and
[48:14] those of you that are here visiting with
[48:15] us and brother Paul Clawson is wife and
[48:19] we're happy to have them here as well.
[48:22] So
[48:24] I want to I want to take a subject uh
[48:27] desperation brings change
[48:31] and uh I have been pondering this
[48:34] subject about change. Change doesn't
[48:36] come very easy. I don't know if you have
[48:38] found it easy. I found change very
[48:41] difficult.
[48:43] Uh and and desperation has a way of
[48:46] making change a little bit easier
[48:49] because when desperation comes or you
[48:52] become desperate about something or
[48:53] you're squeezed into a desperate
[48:56] situation, it can force some changes. It
[49:00] just automatically brings some changes.
[49:03] And so that's why I just thought you
[49:05] might uh register this in your heart
[49:09] that desperation
[49:11] brings uh change and and not always
[49:14] because in this day and age we have a
[49:18] unique way of of
[49:20] kind of accommodating
[49:22] desperate things. We've got a lot of
[49:25] crutches that we can lean on and uh you
[49:30] know uh for for sickness for example and
[49:34] physical ailments we have all kinds of
[49:36] remedies and and hospitals and clinics
[49:40] and all kinds of therapy and every kind
[49:44] of imaginable thing. Uh some are genuine
[49:48] and some are not. that we have those and
[49:51] and of course uh we we use them. Uh but
[49:56] it it would bring what would normally be
[49:58] if you didn't have those or if you were
[50:00] in a country where that wasn't available
[50:03] to you, it would bring you into some
[50:06] desperation.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; It would bring you into some
[50:09] desperation.
[50:11] So uh now in in Jeremiah, this is what
[50:15] God said to uh through Jeremiah. He says
[50:19] that that I know the thoughts that I
[50:21] think toward you and so on. Thoughts of
[50:23] peace and not of evil to give you an
[50:26] expected end. Then shall you call,
[50:30] that's the first word. You'll call upon
[50:33] me and you shall go and pray. That was
[50:37] the second thing. And I will hearken
[50:40] unto you. And you shall seek me and find
[50:45] me.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; I'm happy for that. You'll seek me and
[50:48] find me when you search for me with all
[50:54] your heart.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; When you seek uh just giving some
[51:00] background
[51:01] when you and and this kind of seeking is
[51:03] not just you know looking or casually
[51:06] looking this seek in the Hebrew is that
[51:10] you have a desire and you are actually
[51:13] requiring it. Amen.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; It is almost like a demand. You are
[51:18] requiring this and you will seek for me.
[51:22] You are requesting it and uh and last
[51:25] but not least to seek to secure it, to
[51:30] obtain it, to find it. And then when you
[51:33] find it, you acquire it. What you have
[51:36] sought for you acquire. So it it it goes
[51:40] out of the realm of, you know, we're
[51:41] just looking for something or I mean I I
[51:44] have an appetite. I have a desire. I
[51:46] have a yearning. I have a craving and
[51:48] I'm kind of going in a certain
[51:50] direction. That's not what the Bible's
[51:52] talking about. That's not what Jeremiah
[51:53] is talking about. That's not what God is
[51:55] saying. He said, "When you seek for me,
[51:58] you will find me when you have sought
[52:00] for me with all of your heart." Amen.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; When you consult, when you inquire, when
[52:08] you study, when you seek with
[52:11] application, you are applying yourself
[52:13] to it. And then uh the second scripture
[52:16] I read and brother Brandham reads both
[52:19] of these scriptures. He says, "And and
[52:23] every man pressth into it." And that
[52:26] pressing is even to the point of
[52:27] suffering violence. it is to be uh to
[52:32] use force or to apply force. And the
[52:35] person we need to apply force to is this
[52:38] guy here.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; And I'm sure you can agree with that
[52:44] in the message desperation. Now, we'll
[52:46] be looking at that uh uh uh a good deal
[52:49] throughout the service, but brother
[52:51] Brandham says at the beginning of this,
[52:53] and I you have no doubt
[52:56] made it a mental mark in your minds, but
[52:59] we always have a lot of uh younger ones
[53:02] that are coming up and newer ones that
[53:04] are coming in and those newer ones
[53:06] perhaps that are listening and those
[53:09] older ones that need to be reminded.
[53:12] Can you say amen to that?
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Usually it takes
[53:16] a state of emergency to throw us into
[53:19] desperation."
[53:22] It's too bad.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; It has to do it do that.
[53:27] It's too bad that desperation that we
[53:30] need desperation. In other words, if I
[53:33] read this correctly and get brother
[53:34] Brandham's thought, he's saying to us,
[53:37] you don't really need an emergency to
[53:41] become desperate.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; You don't really need an emergency. You
[53:46] don't have to wait until something has
[53:49] driven you to such extremity
[53:52] before you seek
[53:55] &gt;&gt; and find
[53:56] &gt;&gt; and pray. You don't have to wait for
[53:59] that.
[54:00] In other words, a bride of Jesus Christ
[54:03] has the wherewithal to come to a place
[54:06] by hearing the word. And this is what
[54:08] we're going to come to in a little bit.
[54:10] By hearing, just seeing God's will
[54:14] should throw us into desperation.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Seeing what he desires.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:22] So now the he says the human beings are
[54:26] so slothful in their mind that it takes
[54:29] an emergency something arises and when
[54:31] they do it throws them into desperation
[54:35] and really in doing that in desperation
[54:38] it brings out the real thing. So
[54:40] desperation can bring out the real
[54:41] thing. I would prefer seeing a person
[54:45] who was not squeezed into an emergency
[54:47] but came to desperation without that
[54:51] &gt;&gt; even though both are fine but it would
[54:53] be better to me it would be better that
[54:56] is why I always have a caution in my
[54:59] heart when I'm called to a deathbed for
[55:03] a deathbed repentance
[55:07] because I realize it doesn't need the
[55:10] deathbed for a person to call on God.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; And when a when a person is in that
[55:16] state, uh all kinds of people and you
[55:19] know, I'm not a prophet or the son of a
[55:21] prophet. I I don't know exactly what
[55:24] their intent or what their motive or
[55:26] what their objective. I know that all
[55:28] kinds of people when they're on their
[55:29] deathbed, they want and we get all we we
[55:32] get requests for prayer all the time.
[55:35] And I always wonder what's what is
[55:37] behind that request? What is did they
[55:40] call on God? Did they did they show that
[55:43] they wanted to serve him when they had
[55:46] their health and when they were a when
[55:48] they had their voice? Was it a witness
[55:50] then? And so that's always a question
[55:52] the person's mind. I'll say to anybody
[55:54] here that's just floating along the
[55:56] stream of life on easy street. I
[55:58] wouldn't I wouldn't stay there.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; You will come to an emergency.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; You will need to call. Hallelujah.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; And there are scripture in this holy
[56:12] book that says, "And they will call and
[56:14] I will not hear them."
[56:16] &gt;&gt; I don't want to find myself in that
[56:18] place.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; I don't want to find myself there.
[56:21] Neither do you.
[56:24] Now, this the message that you'll have
[56:27] to take a a a curve with me here. We're
[56:31] going to move around a curve. And that
[56:35] is I want to bring this to our time in a
[56:39] dispensational way.
[56:42] Brother Brandham preached the token in
[56:45] the morning service and then he preached
[56:49] desperation in the evening service and
[56:52] the next service he preached was
[56:54] pardoned. Hallelujah.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; And I was speaking to brother Tom before
[56:58] he left and I said different ones are
[57:02] coming to me and just in conversation
[57:05] say I've just been reading the des
[57:07] message desperation. I was just
[57:08] listening to desperation and here I had
[57:10] been in it for a couple of weeks in uh
[57:14] mentally turning over the different
[57:16] thoughts and things that brother
[57:18] Brandham had said and I wanted to get
[57:20] into it and study it. And then I was uh
[57:23] speaking with brother uh Dr. Otto
[57:25] Slutner and brother Otto was saying to
[57:28] me I've just been in listening to the
[57:30] message desperation. I said that's
[57:31] amazing.
[57:33] That's what I've been pondering for the
[57:34] last couple of weeks. And he said you
[57:36] know brother Brandham says in there why
[57:38] do we live? You know he said and and
[57:41] you're never you're never really fit to
[57:44] live till you're ready to die.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; And uh he said you should tell that to
[57:49] the congregation. And I said, "Well, I'm
[57:51] about there.
[57:53] We're about at that point." But now,
[57:55] Brother Brandham preached the token in
[57:57] the morning and desperation in the
[58:00] evening. And I hope and trust and pray
[58:04] and believe that when the service is
[58:06] over, you'll perhaps have a a different
[58:10] a better understanding of why it just
[58:12] happened that way. Uh now
[58:16] uh in order for me to uh really bring
[58:20] the kind of uh foundation that I want,
[58:22] I'm going to just back up a wee bit.
[58:26] uh in the time of the token when it was
[58:29] first made known through Moses.
[58:33] The secret of salvation,
[58:36] the secret of being saved from death at
[58:39] that time, the secret of salvation from
[58:42] death in the time of Moses
[58:46] was sealed in the word that was given to
[58:50] Moses. Now, I want to take you on a
[58:52] little mental journey. Please stay with
[58:53] me very closely.
[58:56] So the secret of salvation, this was not
[58:59] just death in a family. That's bad
[59:02] enough. But this was death coming to the
[59:05] eldest of all the nation,
[59:09] &gt;&gt; the firstborn of all the nation and the
[59:12] cattle.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; This was going to be a massive, massive
[59:17] happening
[59:20] &gt;&gt; and desperation.
[59:22] We're not even capable of putting
[59:24] ourselves there. We're sitting here
[59:25] relatively comfortable and and safe and
[59:27] we have our our uh you know our schedule
[59:30] for what we're planning on doing after
[59:31] service. But if you could just if God by
[59:34] the Holy Spirit could help you to go
[59:36] back to this moment and find that the
[59:39] eldest of all the families
[59:44] were sentenced under the sentence of
[59:46] death
[59:47] and all of the cattle. And if we could
[59:50] just comprehend that for a moment and I
[59:53] have been attempting to do so. And now
[59:55] the word that comes from God through the
[59:59] through the mouth of Moses is let every
[1:00:02] man go and get a lamb or it was even a
[1:00:07] lamb or a goat, a lamb for a household
[1:00:11] and you will slay the lamb and you'll
[1:00:14] take the blood. Now get my thought.
[1:00:18] Those are just words. Those are just
[1:00:22] sounds. Somehow Moses was made to know
[1:00:24] that. And so he's speaking this out. And
[1:00:28] so now the words become embodied in the
[1:00:31] ones that believed it.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; And then they went into action and went
[1:00:36] to their field or their their paddic or
[1:00:39] wherever it was and got the animal. And
[1:00:42] then they are slaying this animal and
[1:00:44] collecting this blood. And the woman is
[1:00:47] cooking this uh animal for a Passover
[1:00:50] lamb. And they're doing strange things.
[1:00:53] And they're putting the blood on the
[1:00:55] lentil and the doorpost. And now the
[1:00:58] whole thing, those words have actually
[1:01:01] materialized into an action.
[1:01:05] And for those people to believe that
[1:01:10] this whole nation is coming under the
[1:01:12] sentence of death and this how can we
[1:01:17] relate this blood is somehow and killing
[1:01:20] my lamb and putting this blood over the
[1:01:23] door and how is this going to save me?
[1:01:27] What is the mechanics? What is the
[1:01:30] psychology behind? What's the
[1:01:32] philosophy? How can I relate that this
[1:01:35] blood is going to somehow save my child,
[1:01:38] my son, from death?
[1:01:42] Where's the connection between this
[1:01:44] animal and and and the blood and the
[1:01:47] eating this meat and my wife's always
[1:01:49] cooked this? How is this now? We've
[1:01:52] killed lots of animals and we've shed
[1:01:54] lots of blood. How is this one going to
[1:01:57] save my family?
[1:02:01] The whole the only connection between
[1:02:04] that blood and their salvation. The only
[1:02:06] connection was some words that a prophet
[1:02:09] had spoken
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; and their faith and confidence in those
[1:02:14] words to do this very strange thing.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; How do you connect some words to some
[1:02:21] blood and some blood to saving from
[1:02:24] being killed? That's right.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; How do you put that one together? Praise
[1:02:28] God.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:02:35] and the only connection between the
[1:02:38] words that the prophet spoke
[1:02:41] and the and and connecting it to the
[1:02:43] blood getting on the door was found in a
[1:02:47] person's heart that they believed what
[1:02:50] he said
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; regardless of how strange it was.
[1:02:56] and desperation set in because they
[1:02:58] believed it so much.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; They believed the word so completely.
[1:03:03] They believe the servant, vindicated
[1:03:06] servant of God so completely, they're
[1:03:09] prepared to do anything.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; So the act was strange. Kill a lamb,
[1:03:19] blood on a lentil, blood on the
[1:03:21] doorpost, eat the lamb, and burn what
[1:03:24] remains.
[1:03:26] That's a strange activity,
[1:03:30] but it was done
[1:03:33] because of their belief.
[1:03:36] In the days of Rahab,
[1:03:38] the substance was different. Rahab had a
[1:03:42] scarlet cord.
[1:03:46] Salvation was not in the fabric of the
[1:03:48] cord.
[1:03:49] Amen.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Salvation was sealed in the fact that
[1:03:54] she had received the spies and believed
[1:03:57] what they said. In fact is her salvation
[1:04:00] was in the word of promise. Her
[1:04:02] salvation was actually anchored in what
[1:04:04] they said.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; If you'll do this, we'll keep our word.
[1:04:09] If you'll do that, then we if you'll
[1:04:11] keep your word, we'll keep our word. And
[1:04:14] for that woman to turn around and think
[1:04:16] and and you put this cord in the window
[1:04:19] and here she puts this thing in the
[1:04:21] window, you know, just as a uh as an
[1:04:25] activity, as an action, as an event.
[1:04:28] Yesterday it wasn't there. Today I've
[1:04:30] had it in the house. I' I've had that
[1:04:32] cord here for maybe for years or months
[1:04:34] or whatever more. And now I've been told
[1:04:37] by these two men who are spies that if I
[1:04:40] will put this in there, my whole house
[1:04:42] will be saved and my father and my
[1:04:45] mother and my brothers and my sisters
[1:04:47] and everybody that I uh that I have
[1:04:50] desired for will be saved if I put this
[1:04:53] string in the window.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Now the token
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; has transferred. I want you to see this
[1:05:02] transient movement of the token. At one
[1:05:05] time it was from word. It went to blood.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; This time it's from word to a cord in a
[1:05:12] window.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Today
[1:05:20] salvation has moved on.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; But it still goes from word
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; to substance. Amen.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; The substance in Moses time was blood.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; The substance in Rahab's time was
[1:05:35] accord.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; The substance in the time of our Lord
[1:05:39] Jesus Christ was blood.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying was blood. You might
[1:05:43] say it is blood. That's exactly the
[1:05:46] truth. But it is not the chemistry of
[1:05:49] the blood. It is the life that went out
[1:05:52] from the blood.
[1:05:54] And then that life now became substance
[1:05:57] again.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; That word became substance in a people.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; But it could not until a prophet spoke
[1:06:05] it. And when he spoke it, then it
[1:06:07] actually had a transformation.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; That lamb, that lamb had the blood the
[1:06:16] day before Moses spoke.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; That lamb had the blood coursing through
[1:06:24] its veins the day before Moses spoke.
[1:06:27] But before he spoke those words, that
[1:06:30] blood was nothing more than some red
[1:06:33] substance keeping that lamb alive.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; But after the prophet spoke, that blood
[1:06:38] kept the family alive.
[1:06:41] [Music]
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; So it was not in the blood as such. It
[1:06:47] was in the the word that God had spoken.
[1:06:51] And that word did not originate with
[1:06:53] Moses.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; That word originated in the very essence
[1:06:57] of God
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; in the very thoughts of God, the mind of
[1:07:01] God.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; So I want to go back to that.
[1:07:06] And the prophet said, "And the Passover
[1:07:09] was taken in an emergency in times of
[1:07:13] desperation."
[1:07:15] Said they'd seen the great hand of God.
[1:07:18] I want you to relate it and connect it
[1:07:20] to our time.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; They'd seen all his miracles.
[1:07:26] They'd come under the sign of the token.
[1:07:29] And while they were under the sign of
[1:07:30] the token, they' taken the communion in
[1:07:33] desperation. For they knew all of that
[1:07:36] time God was fixing to strike with
[1:07:39] judgment. And it was a shaking time.
[1:07:43] And we'd be less than honest if we
[1:07:45] didn't say, "And we're in a shaking
[1:07:47] time.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; We're in a very shaking time."
[1:07:51] It was a time when every man was
[1:07:53] examining himself because the word of
[1:07:55] the prophet had not failed one time.
[1:07:59] It had been proven to be true whatever
[1:08:01] he said. And it happened just exactly
[1:08:03] that way. In case you would have any
[1:08:06] question and if you have not been in the
[1:08:09] desperation message, you should go to
[1:08:11] the end of that message and you'll come
[1:08:13] up with one conclusion. What the prophet
[1:08:15] said was exactly the truth.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; And the people he called out was exactly
[1:08:20] the truth. It was the same spirit at the
[1:08:23] front of the message as it was at the
[1:08:24] back of the message.
[1:08:27] So after the after the token was made
[1:08:30] known,
[1:08:32] then shall you call and pray, then you
[1:08:36] shall seek and find me.
[1:08:39] When you shall search for me with all
[1:08:43] your heart.
[1:08:45] I'm being honest with you today. I just
[1:08:47] wonder what changes might take place in
[1:08:50] your life,
[1:08:53] in your home,
[1:08:55] in your family,
[1:08:57] my life.
[1:09:01] If the Holy Spirit somehow gripped us in
[1:09:04] such a way that we began to search
[1:09:09] and seek for him with all our heart, the
[1:09:14] totality of our heart, the extremity of
[1:09:17] our heart, every fiber of our being was
[1:09:22] set on one goal. And we began to seek
[1:09:24] him. I wonder what would happen in this
[1:09:26] congregation. Wonder what would happen
[1:09:29] in the bride of Jesus Christ if this
[1:09:32] rose up to be far more than just a
[1:09:34] gathering place, a church as such uh
[1:09:38] more than just a sanctuary, more than
[1:09:40] just a place where we come and sing and
[1:09:42] worship and and have the normal course
[1:09:44] of our our meetings. I wonder what would
[1:09:47] take place. I personally believe it
[1:09:49] could be vastly different.
[1:09:55] We've seen also the great hand of God.
[1:09:58] So after the token, after the token,
[1:10:01] listen closely. After the token was made
[1:10:04] known,
[1:10:06] then he says, "Then you'll call and
[1:10:09] you'll pray." In other words, it was
[1:10:10] different after the token was made
[1:10:12] known. And perhaps for someone here
[1:10:14] today, maybe that's going to just become
[1:10:16] a reality to you today.
[1:10:21] the opening of the seals
[1:10:23] through brother Brandham into
[1:10:25] desperation
[1:10:26] in case you miss it and when you go back
[1:10:29] and I'm trusting that a lot of people
[1:10:31] here most of you I trust will go and
[1:10:34] read the message desperation and as is
[1:10:37] the case with very many of of the
[1:10:39] prophets messages they have a personal
[1:10:42] reference
[1:10:44] quite often it has a personal reference
[1:10:46] even before it has a public reference
[1:10:50] And the desperation is exactly that way.
[1:10:52] There's a a big part of the message
[1:10:55] which is for the general public. But the
[1:10:58] first part of the message, brother
[1:11:00] Brandham has himself completely
[1:11:02] integrated with the with the with the
[1:11:05] message. He's preaching the message from
[1:11:07] a p personal perspective. And I need to
[1:11:10] get convey that some of some to you
[1:11:13] today because that's very very
[1:11:15] important. So the opening of the seals
[1:11:17] threw him into desperation. He says so
[1:11:21] I'm going to read those quotes as I as I
[1:11:24] come to them then I want you to say why
[1:11:27] did that throw him into such
[1:11:29] desperation. It's because there was a
[1:11:32] realization. He came into a realization
[1:11:36] that the Holy Spirit that was moving
[1:11:38] through the spoken word
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; was the token over the people. Amen.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; You can see the place that he was seeing
[1:11:50] himself in that the the seals were now
[1:11:53] open just a short time before maybe 3 4
[1:11:56] months before and now he's uh led uh by
[1:12:00] this sovereign grace to speak the token
[1:12:04] to the people and to lay it out. Then he
[1:12:06] come in the evening time with
[1:12:08] desperation letting them know that it
[1:12:11] could only come and he says in the in
[1:12:13] the token message that it could only
[1:12:15] come in the evening time. He says this
[1:12:18] about the token. The token never came
[1:12:21] into existence. Never came into
[1:12:24] existence. Now the token was always
[1:12:26] there in the mind of God but it never
[1:12:28] came into existence until the evening
[1:12:31] time. And this is the evening time of
[1:12:35] the age that we live in.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; If it was back then, how much closer are
[1:12:39] we now? Where are you at now at this
[1:12:42] point? And this is the evening time that
[1:12:45] we live in. He said this is the evening
[1:12:47] time for the church. Hello, church.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Would you say amen? I believe that.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; He says this is the evening time for me.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:00] Now he often referred to himself as an
[1:13:03] old man but by today's standards he was
[1:13:05] a very young man yet
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; to pass off the scene and be gone and
[1:13:10] taken at the age of 56 today is
[1:13:12] considered very very young and so he was
[1:13:15] a probably about 54 when he was saying
[1:13:18] this and this is the evening time for me
[1:13:21] he was feeling it he was sensing it he
[1:13:24] even said you know that two of us can't
[1:13:26] be here at the same time I must decrease
[1:13:29] and he must increase. You know, I can't
[1:13:31] be with you much longer. Here he's
[1:13:33] saying that in his mid50s
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; and he's gone in a few months.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; This is the evening time for me.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Did that happen?
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; He said it's the evening time for the
[1:13:47] church.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Will that happen?
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And this is the evening
[1:13:53] time of my message."
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; I'm dying. I'm going. I'm moving out in
[1:14:00] the evening time of the gospel.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Did that happen? Was that so?
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Then it's so for you and I.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; And he says it throws a person into
[1:14:11] desperation. So he was realizing that
[1:14:14] the word, the spirit, the holy spirit
[1:14:17] moving through the word of this season,
[1:14:20] this hour was the token for the people.
[1:14:23] And that is why he comes blasting
[1:14:25] across. It's a shaking time. So, we
[1:14:28] can't fool around any longer. And he
[1:14:30] brought it right down to the poop the
[1:14:32] the people themselves.
[1:14:35] He said, now
[1:14:39] in the in and I'm staying in the same
[1:14:41] message, he says, watch what's come
[1:14:44] after the seals.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Watch what's come after the seals. He
[1:14:50] says the uniting of the people,
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; united signs,
[1:14:56] the red light flashing in the last days,
[1:14:59] the sign of women getting prettier and
[1:15:02] men what they would do. all these signs
[1:15:06] of the Holy Spirit leading up and then
[1:15:10] come right back here to the capping off
[1:15:13] of all those messages since the seals
[1:15:16] that's capped off in this one thing the
[1:15:19] token
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; that we are all right
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; that's what threw him in such
[1:15:25] desperation
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; that the people needed to grasp that
[1:15:29] this was the evening time for the church
[1:15:32] the evening time for the message the
[1:15:35] evening time of this generation and the
[1:15:38] token had now come on the scene and must
[1:15:41] be applied.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; We must take the substance has changed.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; You can take all the sheep or lambs or
[1:15:52] goats of this entire country and you
[1:15:55] won't have uh one ounce of salvation in
[1:15:57] it. You can have all the red cords in
[1:16:00] the country and put it in your windows.
[1:16:02] It won't do one thing for you. Won't
[1:16:05] save you from judgment at all. But but
[1:16:08] the the very word of God in each season
[1:16:12] that word becomes a substance. And
[1:16:14] that's where I want to go. He said, "Now
[1:16:16] watch what it is." And then it comes and
[1:16:18] capping off in the token that we're all
[1:16:20] right. He said, "Just check ourselves
[1:16:23] and see if we're in the faith." He says,
[1:16:25] "And I see things coming up."
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; And you can't tell the people. said,
[1:16:30] "You see, you see different things and
[1:16:33] you're forbidden." Them visions that
[1:16:36] they call on, notice them visions that
[1:16:39] they call on.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; When you read a message, you need to
[1:16:44] read it.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Very, very carefully.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you, I read them
[1:16:50] very, very carefully. And I'll say
[1:16:52] secondly, I need to read them even more
[1:16:55] carefully. But I ponder them very, very
[1:16:58] deep.
[1:16:59] and I watch how they're phrased.
[1:17:03] He told me, he said, "The people think I
[1:17:05] have the visions." He says, "It's their
[1:17:08] faith
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; that causes me to have the vision."
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Even says one place, "Don't don't p
[1:17:16] don't pull like that. Don't do that." Is
[1:17:17] what he's saying. as the people were
[1:17:19] pulling on them to have a vision for
[1:17:21] their health, for their condition, for
[1:17:22] their family, for their son, their
[1:17:24] daughter or whatever more. And he was he
[1:17:26] he was trying to index the anointing
[1:17:30] around so he could bring the word, the
[1:17:32] message, that's what the people needed.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; He said, so the token that we are all
[1:17:40] right.
[1:17:41] And he says, and I see things coming up
[1:17:43] and you you can't tell the people. You
[1:17:46] see different things and you're
[1:17:47] forbidden them visions that they call on
[1:17:51] and sometimes they'd be sorry if you did
[1:17:54] tell them and you know better than to do
[1:17:57] it and then you go so far into visions
[1:18:00] till everything becomes a vision and it
[1:18:02] throws you into a nervous stage and you
[1:18:06] look and say now am I in a vision like
[1:18:09] sitting here right here
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; see where he was at
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; is Is this a vision? He asked. Is this a
[1:18:18] vision?
[1:18:20] Where am I really standing at? And
[1:18:22] you're overworked. You're overworked
[1:18:25] yourself. Overtax yourself. And you find
[1:18:28] out things about people that you wish
[1:18:31] you didn't know. The people that desires
[1:18:34] these things to know these things, they
[1:18:36] don't realize what that type of ministry
[1:18:39] costs.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; You don't know what goes with it. And
[1:18:42] then it throws into desperation. Lord
[1:18:45] God, I I know I'm going to have to
[1:18:49] answer.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; And that's when I think it was uh
[1:18:55] uh one of the brothers that worked with
[1:18:58] him there just name just slipped me as I
[1:19:00] made reference to it and he said, "I'd
[1:19:02] hate to have to answer for what you have
[1:19:04] to answer for."
[1:19:07] Then he comes into that
[1:19:09] the realization of what a person may
[1:19:11] have to answer for.
[1:19:14] I mean even our examples in our
[1:19:17] influence
[1:19:18] and what we can be and what we are what
[1:19:21] we are and how we conduct things. Now I
[1:19:24] can tell you one thing friends
[1:19:26] if if we come to a stage and I say if we
[1:19:31] do because I'm convinced that we're not
[1:19:33] there. We're not seeking God with all of
[1:19:36] our heart. I say from the pulpit to the
[1:19:39] pew
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; seek him with all of our heart to the
[1:19:44] full extremity to other it it begins to
[1:19:48] replace other things I've got to move on
[1:19:50] from here otherwise I'll be distracted
[1:19:54] how would anyone know just exactly what
[1:19:57] a person is to do now brother Brennham
[1:20:00] in this paragraph and I'm largely in
[1:20:02] desperation
[1:20:04] he uses this phrase flashes
[1:20:07] of the end time. I hope it lodges in
[1:20:10] your heart like it lodges into mine
[1:20:12] flashes of the end time. I I I wonder if
[1:20:16] we're, you know, perhaps casting it. He
[1:20:18] says, "Then seeing then seeing these
[1:20:20] signs coming,
[1:20:23] seeing the Holy Spirit take us out
[1:20:25] there." Now, watch what signs he's
[1:20:28] talking about.
[1:20:30] And bring these seals and lay them in
[1:20:33] like that. and bring the church ages and
[1:20:36] lay them in. Then come down in a great
[1:20:39] big pillar of fire back there and reveal
[1:20:41] himself. Then come down on the next
[1:20:44] thing on the seven seals and reveal it.
[1:20:47] Even put it in the papers, the
[1:20:49] magazines. Then what am I reading this
[1:20:52] for? This is what this is what
[1:20:54] contributed to his desperation.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what made him desperate.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; We may sit and listen to it and read it
[1:21:08] may not have any effect. Other people
[1:21:10] saw the magazines, saw it in the
[1:21:12] newspapers, all the rest of it. All
[1:21:14] kinds of Egyptians, they they saw the
[1:21:16] blood they walked by, it it didn't
[1:21:18] inspire them to kill a lamb.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Even if there was a hope in it, it never
[1:21:23] inspired them. And there was perhaps
[1:21:26] many Israelis or Israelites or children
[1:21:29] of Abraham that perhaps didn't do it as
[1:21:31] the as the presentation of young people
[1:21:33] did here a few years ago.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Maybe things were okay for them. They
[1:21:40] were living, you know, things were all
[1:21:41] right and they weren't brought into a
[1:21:43] desperate pos place. And we're happen to
[1:21:45] be in an age that I know that no one is
[1:21:48] going to go from here and not have any
[1:21:50] any food on the table. You you got some
[1:21:52] food on the table. You got a mode of
[1:21:55] travel when you get out of here. You got
[1:21:56] some friends. You got uh if you have few
[1:21:59] friends or many friends, you have that.
[1:22:01] And we have a support structure. We have
[1:22:03] a civilization. We have an economy. We
[1:22:06] have some you're you're okay.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Whether you do it or you don't do it,
[1:22:12] you're going to make it. You're you're
[1:22:14] going to you're going to live. You're
[1:22:15] going to carry on. You're going to go to
[1:22:17] work. You're going to
[1:22:20] You see what I mean?
[1:22:22] Now, here here was something in brother
[1:22:24] Brandham's life. It wasn't it wasn't a
[1:22:26] death.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; It wasn't his wife laying in the
[1:22:30] hospital.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; It wasn't some tragedy that was
[1:22:34] happening within his family.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; It was the things that he was seeing. He
[1:22:40] was
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; seeing the mighty spirit of God coming,
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; taking the word that had been sealed. He
[1:22:48] believed that with all of his heart.
[1:22:50] these secrets that have been sealed from
[1:22:53] the beginning of time and it was
[1:22:55] consuming him. Uh these things that have
[1:22:58] been held secret in the sealed book, God
[1:23:01] opened up these things.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; What does it mean?
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; What does this mean for the people? What
[1:23:08] does it mean for me? What does it mean
[1:23:10] for the time that I'm in? Amen.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; This is what was taking gripping him and
[1:23:20] to come down in the next thing he said
[1:23:22] and reveal it and put it in the papers
[1:23:24] and magazines and come and take the
[1:23:26] angels of God them seven angels with
[1:23:30] seven messages and confirmed it exactly
[1:23:33] what the Bible said. Then during that
[1:23:36] time, come up and bring those seven
[1:23:38] seals, those signs, flashes of the end
[1:23:42] time and bringing it up to the people
[1:23:45] and tell them what it is and all about
[1:23:47] it.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Now, it hasn't hasn't just happened, but
[1:23:50] he's he's brought it to the people and
[1:23:52] told them what it is.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; He says, and and the Lord working right
[1:23:57] there, showing himself present.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; He never went away even during that
[1:24:03] time. Now, new things are coming forth.
[1:24:05] It didn't all turn just to doctrine.
[1:24:08] Even after the end of desperation,
[1:24:10] starts calling people out and showing
[1:24:13] that he's still present
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; and he's the one who's revealing these
[1:24:18] things and bringing it down to a token
[1:24:20] time and letting the people know. He's
[1:24:23] still confirming that I'm still here.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; It may sound strange, but it's still the
[1:24:29] same person speaking.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:33] Amen.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; It's not a It may sound different, but
[1:24:38] it's not a different one speaking.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; He says, "And showing himself present
[1:24:51] and then write down like this morning,
[1:24:55] come up and require that token
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; on every person." Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; This is what was making him tremble.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; He was going back. He's rehearsing. He
[1:25:09] says, "And here comes all these signs.
[1:25:11] And here comes this at the end of his
[1:25:14] ministry of the evening time." He just
[1:25:17] spoke it in the morning, the evening
[1:25:19] time of my ministry, evening time of my
[1:25:21] life, evening time for the church. It
[1:25:23] came the token came into existence in
[1:25:26] the evening time. And now it comes in
[1:25:29] desperation. And God requires it.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; It's not something you take and leave
[1:25:35] it. It's not just something that's
[1:25:37] optional.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; And require that token on every person.
[1:25:47] He makes this powerful statement.
[1:25:51] Then
[1:25:52] you're my people. All right.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; You're the ones that I love
[1:26:02] these and them listening to the tapes
[1:26:04] and so forth. Then you see what
[1:26:07] desperation
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; it puts on me.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; That's what led him to desperation.
[1:26:18] If you go through that message just
[1:26:20] quickly,
[1:26:22] there was those who came into
[1:26:23] desperation because of famine.
[1:26:28] Women because they were barren,
[1:26:33] others because of some tragedy and
[1:26:36] death,
[1:26:38] some because of sickness.
[1:26:41] And I'm going to, Lord willing, I'm
[1:26:44] going to come to the end
[1:26:46] in a few moments.
[1:26:48] And there was one that he has in there
[1:26:51] that she had none of those.
[1:26:54] And it was called the Queen of the
[1:26:55] South.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; The Queen of Sheba.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; She wasn't poor.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; She wasn't lacking food.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; She wasn't coming because she had
[1:27:09] enemies.
[1:27:10] She wasn't coming because her kingdom
[1:27:12] was threatened or her home was
[1:27:13] threatened.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; She wasn't coming. But she had heard
[1:27:18] [Applause]
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; of the wisdom of Solomon.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; And she had heard about the name of the
[1:27:25] Lord.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; So, I must go.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; I must find this out.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; I must hear it for myself.
[1:27:35] [Music]
[1:27:37] And something within her drove her to
[1:27:40] desperation when there was no no
[1:27:44] material thing that was causing it.
[1:27:46] There was no physical thing. There was
[1:27:49] no other thing. It was a desire within
[1:27:52] her that drove her to desperation.
[1:27:54] That's where I'm at this morning.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Oh God, increase that desire until that
[1:28:01] desire eats you out. Until that desire
[1:28:05] gnaws at your soul and your spirit, when
[1:28:08] everything's going fine, may I pray that
[1:28:11] that will gnaw at your very inner being.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; That it'll cost you sleep
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; and cost you food.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; And you'll lose your appetite.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; You'll lose your hunger for all other
[1:28:26] things. You'll lose your uh the things
[1:28:28] that stimulate you. It won't stimulate
[1:28:30] you anymore. It'll become more repulsive
[1:28:33] to you
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; when you sing. I have a craving.
[1:28:44] I have a craving in my soul for God.
[1:28:49] It's driving me to my room. It's driving
[1:28:51] me to my knees. It's driving me in
[1:28:54] desperation.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:01] Brother Milco, that's why
[1:29:03] I appreciate that email this morning.
[1:29:06] So, I become so desperate.
[1:29:10] I had to tell my wife. I have to tell
[1:29:12] her.
[1:29:13] So desperate because this is this is the
[1:29:16] rapture time. This is the end time.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; And when we hear we hear from this
[1:29:21] vindicated mouth, things are going to go
[1:29:23] right on. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; I declare they're going to have services
[1:29:27] in this church
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; after the rapture's taken place. You
[1:29:32] might say, "Who's going to come?" Well,
[1:29:34] they'll find some people to come.
[1:29:35] There'll be people at the altar pounding
[1:29:38] the altar weeping tears believing
[1:29:40] they're getting saved and it's all over.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; And you shouldn't look shocked. That's
[1:29:47] what this messenger said.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; And that's why I said we want to shake
[1:29:52] ourselves. Make sure you're not one of
[1:29:54] those.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; I want to just take you quickly.
[1:30:11] Just hold this truth right now. Hold
[1:30:13] where we're at, please.
[1:30:18] I I want you to look at with me
[1:30:20] something that really intrigues me very
[1:30:22] very deeply in regard to this subject.
[1:30:24] That is the very essence. I'm I'm
[1:30:27] fascinated. I'm I believe it's something
[1:30:30] that we need to at least understand.
[1:30:34] And that is
[1:30:36] how how does this transfer?
[1:30:39] This God that fills all time and space,
[1:30:43] this essence of God, this this part of
[1:30:46] his being.
[1:30:48] And uh brother Brandham, I have to go
[1:30:51] quickly, but brother Brandham says that
[1:30:53] a thought has to be created.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; We hear the phrase all the time, it a
[1:31:00] word is a thought expressed. But brother
[1:31:03] Brandham says more than once, but the
[1:31:04] thought had to be created.
[1:31:07] So God, this great being perhaps even
[1:31:11] billions and billions of years ago in
[1:31:13] man's time, but God within this God,
[1:31:18] this one who spoke worlds into existence
[1:31:21] and hung stars out and perhaps is still
[1:31:24] creating, I don't know, and billions and
[1:31:27] billions of of star systems and uh all
[1:31:30] kinds of galaxies out there. Uh who who
[1:31:34] can even begin to comprehend? I don't
[1:31:36] even know how that God finds me.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; The speck of dust
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; in this little speck called the earth.
[1:31:44] How God how God identified this earth as
[1:31:47] a womb for his seed. And then he let his
[1:31:50] life come and let beings like us come
[1:31:53] here on the earth and that he would love
[1:31:55] us
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; and sent his own spirit, his own son in
[1:32:01] Jesus Christ and let the word be
[1:32:03] transformed into flesh. Yes.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; With newly created blood by the word of
[1:32:09] God spoken through prophets.
[1:32:14] [Music]
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; It came from even a the thought of God
[1:32:21] into substance.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; What a story.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; What an account.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; The creating of the thought.
[1:32:32] And God said, I don't think he spoke
[1:32:35] English.
[1:32:36] And I doubt if he spoke Hebrew. I don't
[1:32:39] know what he spoke, but there's a sound.
[1:32:42] There's no sound without some meaning.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; And God uttered something. It might have
[1:32:48] been a thunder.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; I don't know what it was,
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; but it conveyed the essence of his
[1:32:54] thought.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; It was a sound that had a meaning.
[1:32:59] And the proof that it had a meaning is
[1:33:01] when he said it, something happened on
[1:33:03] the other end.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; So watch this sequence please. This
[1:33:13] process. He created the thought.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; And then he gave the thought sound,
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; a word.
[1:33:24] And when that was uttered,
[1:33:27] it materialized
[1:33:29] into what he had thought. The essence of
[1:33:32] his thought began to materialize.
[1:33:35] Let the earth bring forth. Well,
[1:33:39] maybe it could have just covered over
[1:33:41] with some kind of a a fog,
[1:33:45] but he had something in his mind.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Let the earth bring forth."
[1:33:50] And when it began to bring forth,
[1:33:52] vegetation began to come. And if there
[1:33:55] had been, if you had been there standing
[1:33:57] there watching, you could have said,
[1:33:58] "Oh, that's what he meant."
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Because the materialization of it
[1:34:03] interpreted what he thought.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; You're staying with me.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Materialized into substance in its
[1:34:12] season.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Based on what I've just said,
[1:34:19] you think your mother and dad brought
[1:34:20] you here?
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; I said they had very little with
[1:34:25] bringing you here
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; by that conception and by that birth,
[1:34:30] you're going to die.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; But if you were in the mind of God,
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; in which I can say all you are now is a
[1:34:40] materialization of his thought.
[1:34:44] If you're a materialization of his
[1:34:46] thought, you're going to go back where
[1:34:47] he intended you to be.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; God didn't think when he be brought his
[1:34:54] sons and daughters, brought humanity,
[1:34:55] brought people in his image. He didn't
[1:34:57] think, "Oh, I'll leave them here and
[1:34:59] they'll just die and go to ashes and
[1:35:01] somehow that gets him glory." That
[1:35:04] doesn't get him glory. That doesn't get
[1:35:06] him fellowship. That doesn't achieve his
[1:35:08] purpose.
[1:35:10] Amen.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; He brought you here as a materialization
[1:35:13] of his thought
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; to take you back and have fellowship
[1:35:18] with you throughout eternity.
[1:35:23] [Music]
[1:35:24] [Applause]
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; And the word became flesh, which is the
[1:35:34] India report. He said, "And every word
[1:35:37] in the Bible is God's thoughts
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; laid in seed form."
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Notice in seed form. That's one form.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; That if it's received into the human
[1:35:49] being, hello human beings.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; If it's received in the human being and
[1:35:55] spoke by the same thought that
[1:35:58] materialized the Bible,
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; it brings the thing to pass. Yeah.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not man's word. It's
[1:36:07] not man's thought. It's not man's sound.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Now, this brother here, a sister over
[1:36:17] here, maybe another brother, sister over
[1:36:20] here, and I'm sure many within this
[1:36:22] congregation can say,
[1:36:24] "God spoke to me."
[1:36:28] When you say that, I doubt very much if
[1:36:31] it was uttered in any words. Amen.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; It was something he made you to know.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; And you knew it so clear.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; In fact, as it was so clear, you
[1:36:44] couldn't even think of any words that
[1:36:46] would make it that clear.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; I could say to you or I could say, "I am
[1:36:54] convinced." But oh, the thing that God
[1:36:57] made no one has got a went went much
[1:37:00] deeper than just being convinced. Oh,
[1:37:02] that's why we can say I know that I know
[1:37:04] that I know. What are we trying to say?
[1:37:06] I'm thoroughly convinced.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "If God
[1:37:14] showed you or spoke to you and and and
[1:37:18] let you know, you're healed.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; You are healed.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; That cancer is gone." And the doctor
[1:37:26] said, "You'll be dead before morning."
[1:37:29] He said you would laugh in that doctor's
[1:37:32] face.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; He wasn't saying you'd be disrespectful.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; He wasn't saying that you would dishonor
[1:37:38] him or you'd make fun of him or you want
[1:37:41] to mock him or you want to disregard
[1:37:43] him. No. Nothing changes with the doctor
[1:37:45] patient status. But it is the fact that
[1:37:48] something else was so real to you,
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; you couldn't possibly comprehend what
[1:37:55] he's saying.
[1:37:58] And that's where the laughter part comes
[1:38:00] in. You'll be dead by morning. Oh
[1:38:03] doctor, if you only knew
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; what has come from another diagnosis.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; If you only knew
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; there are origin of another thought.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; That's why he said that.
[1:38:25] And he said, and God said, "Let there be
[1:38:28] a world." He said, "Before it could be a
[1:38:31] word, it had to be a thought." So God in
[1:38:34] creation created the world by his
[1:38:37] thought first, then spoke it, and the
[1:38:41] thought expressed became material. Amen.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; So God had to speak it to a prophet. How
[1:38:54] he spoke it, I don't know. But it was
[1:38:56] very, very concise and specific. Tell
[1:38:59] the people that every man should take a
[1:39:01] lamb for his household, a lamb for every
[1:39:05] house. Up to that moment, those lambs
[1:39:09] were frolicking and kicking around out
[1:39:11] in the pasture, and their blood was
[1:39:14] worthless. as far as saving a man from
[1:39:16] death.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Are you getting my point?
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; But that word materialized that blood
[1:39:22] into a saving power.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; That even the blood in that lamb became
[1:39:29] more powerful than the armies of Egypt.
[1:39:36] The blood materialized
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; into something else
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; and was more powerful than Pharaoh's
[1:39:44] decree.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; And now
[1:39:59] catch it please. Now you have a
[1:40:02] vindicated
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; prophet who speaks and it happens.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Who speaks
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; and it materializes.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Who speaks and says that is the mystery
[1:40:13] of the seven seals. And there it is in
[1:40:15] the sign in the heavens and there is a
[1:40:18] cloud and that was seven angels. He's
[1:40:21] speaking and he's saying this is the
[1:40:24] interpretation thereof. This is the
[1:40:25] revelation thereof. Up to that time you
[1:40:29] read it in the Bible. Theologians read
[1:40:30] it in the Bible. All kinds of people
[1:40:32] read it in the Bible. But now it became
[1:40:35] uh it became a known. It was no more a
[1:40:37] secret. It no more a mystery. It was
[1:40:40] revealed.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; But not only to us who read it and say,
[1:40:43] "Ah, this has been revealed. Now I see
[1:40:45] it different." That wasn't the purpose.
[1:40:47] He went into desperation to let you know
[1:40:50] that that was the token.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; This is going to allow you to pass from
[1:40:57] death
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; and judgment.
[1:41:00] For this world is under judgment.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; And the token could only be made known
[1:41:06] in the evening time, in the evening of
[1:41:08] his life, in the evening of his message,
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; in the evening of the church.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; It could only come in our time. It came
[1:41:15] in your time.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; You can say,
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; "Well, well, I have the token on my
[1:41:25] shelf." No, that's not sufficient.
[1:41:27] That's like saying the man saying, "I
[1:41:29] have the token out in the barn.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; The token is out there feeding in the in
[1:41:36] the pasture." And it's so nice, you
[1:41:38] know? I really don't think I It's a
[1:41:41] child's pet. And I really that's the
[1:41:44] only really perfect one I have.
[1:41:47] And I just think that is wee bit
[1:41:50] extreme.
[1:41:51] Kill it.
[1:41:54] Take it from my kids.
[1:41:56] put the blood and I'm so emotionally
[1:41:59] attached. You know what? I think it's
[1:42:02] okay. It just out feeds out there for
[1:42:04] another day or two. I'll see how this
[1:42:07] thing unfolds.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; I'll just see what happens.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; I'll see what happens in the church. And
[1:42:13] then maybe the time will come when I'll
[1:42:15] have to get a jolt and get serious. And
[1:42:17] no,
[1:42:20] I can tell you right today, there's
[1:42:21] people that have played with this
[1:42:22] message
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; in this area
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; that I personally, unless God by
[1:42:28] additional grace does something for
[1:42:31] them, there's no way they're going to
[1:42:34] make a rapture.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; You're quiet when I say that, but I say
[1:42:39] that in the name of the Lord.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; There's no way. treating the message
[1:42:44] with a with a laxidasical and and and
[1:42:46] and uh without any sincerity, without
[1:42:50] any seriousness and not even knowing
[1:42:52] what the messenger said. How can you
[1:42:55] believe it's even how can you believe
[1:42:56] that your it's your escape from
[1:42:58] judgment?
[1:42:59] [Applause]
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; And we realize judgment's coming. Hey,
[1:43:05] death on a slab on a morg is nothing.
[1:43:08] That's a that's only kindergarten stuff.
[1:43:11] And look what we go through to escape
[1:43:13] that to extend our life. Well, I I don't
[1:43:16] want to die yet. I want to live. I want
[1:43:18] to continue on. And and we we'll call
[1:43:20] the whole church and send emails all
[1:43:21] over the country cuz pray for somebody
[1:43:23] cuz they're they're going to die. I tell
[1:43:25] you what, that's just child stuff.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Think about dying and facing God
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; and to give an account for what you did
[1:43:34] with the word that he sent. And he'd
[1:43:36] say, "Did I confirm it?" "Yes, you
[1:43:38] confirmed it. Did I preach it? Did I
[1:43:40] send my message? Did I send my preacher?
[1:43:43] Did I send Did I speak to you? Did I
[1:43:45] send the Holy Ghost? Yes, Lord. Yes,
[1:43:47] Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes, you did. What's
[1:43:49] going to be the answer?
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; It's not some big thunder
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; or lightning.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; It's that still small voice
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; that I'm interested in this morning.
[1:44:04] That still small voice
[1:44:06] that speaks to you.
[1:44:09] is calling you.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; But we're too busy. We're taken up with
[1:44:15] all kinds of other things. We're taken
[1:44:16] up with things of this life and it's all
[1:44:18] perishing.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Whatever we have,
[1:44:27] whatever smart you have, whatever
[1:44:29] intelligence you have, use it for God.
[1:44:31] Whatever skills you have, use them for
[1:44:34] God. Whatever position God puts you in,
[1:44:36] use it for God. Whatever possessions God
[1:44:38] gives you, use it for the kingdom of
[1:44:40] God. Our Father, which art in heaven,
[1:44:43] hallowed be thy name.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Don't be caught into just an emotional
[1:44:51] scene. Don't be caught and say, "Well,
[1:44:53] God really spoke to me. I'm I'm
[1:44:55] weeping." I just soon have a person not
[1:44:57] weep at all. And have their life co
[1:44:59] totally transformed. Say, "I did
[1:45:02] business with God. God spoke to me. He
[1:45:04] said thus and thus and I have responded
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; this has not been the pattern of my life
[1:45:10] but I am making a change
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; because something was spoken by our pro
[1:45:15] by our pastor today that touched me very
[1:45:18] deep and I'm giving myself to it
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; I want you to join me
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; I'm seeking to do the same thing
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; can I take just a few more minutes.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; He said he was in the beginning by
[1:45:38] himself.
[1:45:40] God dwelt alone with his thoughts. He'll
[1:45:44] never do that again.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Because his thoughts
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; are being made manifest.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; What is he saying? His thoughts become
[1:45:56] manifest once they're manifest. They're
[1:45:59] not something that passes off the scene.
[1:46:01] He receives that what what the
[1:46:03] materialization of it. He receives it
[1:46:05] back to himself.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; He says why we are right here this very
[1:46:11] day. God is fellowshipping with his
[1:46:13] thoughts being made manifest.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I take that
[1:46:18] God
[1:46:20] somehow beyond my comprehension, this
[1:46:24] God that we speak of is here
[1:46:29] at this moment.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; And like I might step up and shake hands
[1:46:35] with someone, but this God
[1:46:39] is is fellowshipping. Maybe I don't know
[1:46:42] what your thought is sitting here today,
[1:46:44] but this God according to this word is
[1:46:48] fellowshipping
[1:46:50] with his thoughts.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; I suppose if he could express it, and
[1:46:54] I'm a poor one to express it for him,
[1:46:56] but in he'd be saying,
[1:47:00] "I thought of them.
[1:47:03] I thought of her.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; I thought of him. I thought of him as a
[1:47:09] child.
[1:47:11] I thought of her as a young person. I I
[1:47:13] thought of them.
[1:47:16] I thought of their union. I thought of
[1:47:18] their marriage.
[1:47:19] I thought of who they would bring into
[1:47:21] the world and and how they would train
[1:47:25] them up.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; And oh, what a pleasure that is to me.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; What a joy that is to me.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; God fellowshipping with the thought. But
[1:47:35] we're sitting here and maybe wondering
[1:47:37] when's this service going to end and you
[1:47:39] know going through the Bible and reading
[1:47:42] and here God's wanting to fellowship
[1:47:43] with his thoughts
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; and God expressed in Jesus Christ when
[1:47:51] the prophet said he only asked for one
[1:47:53] thing only one thing he didn't ask for
[1:47:56] your money he didn't ask for your houses
[1:47:57] and lands he didn't ask for your car he
[1:48:00] didn't ask for anything he asked for
[1:48:02] your fellowship
[1:48:05] It's
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; the only thing you desire your
[1:48:09] fellowship.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; He says a little further.
[1:48:24] He says, "And for this word, as we've
[1:48:25] seen this morning, has to be fulfilled,
[1:48:30] it is God's thoughts made manifest by
[1:48:32] his word and brought into
[1:48:36] reality."
[1:48:37] Now he said, 'Now the same one that sent
[1:48:40] the Lord Jesus here by his spoken word,
[1:48:44] it materialized.
[1:48:47] Listen close. The same one,
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; that sent the Lord Jesus here.
[1:48:53] It
[1:48:55] materialized
[1:48:57] and became the word
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; in flesh. Amen.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; You see, there there is a there is a an
[1:49:09] unseen power. There's an unseen force
[1:49:14] in God's word. I'm talking about not all
[1:49:17] words that are preached, but in God's
[1:49:19] word,
[1:49:21] there's a force in it that actually
[1:49:24] materializes the individual. You may not
[1:49:26] change like like that blood in the lamb.
[1:49:28] It didn't it didn't change the lamb. The
[1:49:30] lamb remained in the same structure. It
[1:49:33] was it always was an animal. And the
[1:49:35] blood when it came out, it was red
[1:49:37] substance like all the other all the
[1:49:39] other animals. But there was a word
[1:49:42] associated with that lamb.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; You're human like all other people are
[1:49:48] human. They're walking the streets.
[1:49:50] They're around us by the millions. But
[1:49:52] there are some people, they're not
[1:49:53] structurally any different. They may be
[1:49:55] culturally different. They may speak a
[1:49:57] different language or something else.
[1:49:59] But there are some people that are under
[1:50:01] they're actually under
[1:50:04] a certain word of promise.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Rahab, she didn't change at all. She had
[1:50:10] the same eyes and the same face and the
[1:50:12] same lips and the same body. She had the
[1:50:15] same pieces of furniture in the house.
[1:50:17] Nothing changed. But she came under a
[1:50:20] promise.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; That was the only difference with her.
[1:50:24] She came under a promise.
[1:50:27] And that promise transformed her from
[1:50:29] harlot to a child of God to a mother of
[1:50:33] Jesus Christ.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Transformed her.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; You're sitting here like all other
[1:50:39] people who may be sitting in church
[1:50:41] today, but God uttered a word which was
[1:50:44] a promise for this evening time season.
[1:50:47] And there are a few people, not many in
[1:50:49] the earth, but there are a few people.
[1:50:52] And the devil would like to have you
[1:50:53] say, "Well, how can I believe that
[1:50:55] that's me? Have you heard it?
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Have you heard it?
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Is there a substance within the message
[1:51:03] that spoke to you very deeply and you
[1:51:06] know that you know
[1:51:08] [Music]
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; I respect people that even even if they
[1:51:13] have backsliden and gone into the world
[1:51:15] and gone into sin when they can say I
[1:51:19] will never deny.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. William Brandon was God's prophet
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; and the word that he spoke is the
[1:51:26] message of the hour.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; I have respect to that
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; because God has respect to it.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; But there's another group of people.
[1:51:37] Oh, God help me and God help you
[1:51:44] that he's actually sent. He sent a
[1:51:46] promise. It has settled down over you.
[1:51:50] It hangs over you.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Wherever you go, in whatever set of
[1:51:54] circumstances you find yourself in, you
[1:51:57] are a promised and you're connected
[1:51:58] because in your heart you have a faith
[1:52:00] and you believe that word.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Everything's going sideways, folks.
[1:52:09] Maybe my health is gone.
[1:52:12] But that person laying in a hospital
[1:52:14] bed, whether it be brother Edwin Dodd or
[1:52:17] be some other person, they believe this
[1:52:20] message with all their heart and soul,
[1:52:22] they have an abiding promise over top of
[1:52:25] them sealing them beyond death, beyond
[1:52:30] the funeral home, beyond the grave,
[1:52:33] beyond anything else. And that power,
[1:52:35] that sealing power, that promise, my
[1:52:38] brother, my sister, will material. It
[1:52:40] will materialize into a change and
[1:52:43] actually change the atoms of your
[1:52:44] physical body.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Not because there has to come any
[1:52:50] special power into it. It's already been
[1:52:53] spoken.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; What happens in a woman's body when she
[1:53:00] conceives and everything, the marvel of
[1:53:03] of human life begins to come. The Bible
[1:53:07] tells us that all of this happened, I
[1:53:10] believe in uh Matthew the 2 chapter, all
[1:53:13] of this happened so that it might be
[1:53:16] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[1:53:19] by the prophets.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; The word of the prophet caused the
[1:53:25] conception.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; The word of the prophet caused a child
[1:53:33] to be formed.
[1:53:37] Hallelujah.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; And if he hadn't spoken, it would never
[1:53:40] have taken place.
[1:53:42] [Applause]
[1:53:42] [Music]
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; What was it? It was the word of Isaiah
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; and the words of the prophets that
[1:53:49] materialized
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; because the season came. And the very
[1:53:54] word that caused that body to form is
[1:53:56] the same word that will cause these
[1:53:58] bodies to transform.
[1:54:04] Hallelujah.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; That's at least part of the message this
[1:54:19] morning.
[1:54:21] I just feel I've gone far enough.
[1:54:24] And if I start digging any further,
[1:54:26] we're going to be another a half hour.
[1:54:28] And I don't want to do that. We're
[1:54:30] having a a service tonight. But this is
[1:54:32] the process of it going from the essence
[1:54:36] of the bosom of God
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; coming to a thought being created sir
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; and then God uttering some sound.
[1:54:47] And I pray I pray with everything that's
[1:54:49] in me that he's uttering a sound.
[1:54:54] As I look across the congregation,
[1:54:59] you need to hear something specific to
[1:55:01] yourself.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Even though you may have your husband or
[1:55:08] wife or your dear friend next to you,
[1:55:11] they don't know really what you need.
[1:55:15] But God knows exactly
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; what to speak.
[1:55:19] And he'll say it. It won't be brother
[1:55:22] Disco's words, but I just pray that
[1:55:25] perhaps there was something said that
[1:55:28] put you into a certain connection.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; I heard God speak to me.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; I heard God say something.
[1:55:39] And then I'll just say to you, whatever
[1:55:41] he saith,
[1:55:43] do it.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Do it.
[1:55:50] I could go into Hannah.
[1:55:54] The prophet said her desperation became
[1:55:56] so great
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; a priest, a learned man, a man of the
[1:56:01] word thought she was drunk.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; The Shunomite woman became so desperate.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. And when she rode up to the
[1:56:13] prophet's residence, she was in such
[1:56:16] desperation.
[1:56:17] But when the prophet finally decided
[1:56:20] that he would go himself
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; down to the dead son and she was asked,
[1:56:25] "How is it?" She said, "All is well."
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; And then she said, and then he said her
[1:56:32] desperation,
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; you know, it melted away
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; and then it became the prophet's
[1:56:37] desperation cuz there he was and the
[1:56:39] dead child down there and he went down
[1:56:42] there and laid upon that son and and let
[1:56:45] eyes to eyes and lips to lips and hands
[1:56:48] to hands and the boy sneezed and came
[1:56:51] back to life. And then his desperation
[1:56:54] was over. Said it took her desperation
[1:56:56] and his desperation. She wanted she she
[1:56:59] she wanted her desperation was for the
[1:57:01] prophet and his desperation was he
[1:57:03] wanted to know.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; And God held it from him. He said,
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said, and this this
[1:57:13] means something to all of us. Brother
[1:57:15] Brandham said, "Peter," and he stepped
[1:57:17] out of the boat at the Lord's command,
[1:57:19] at the Lord's invitation. He stepped out
[1:57:22] of the boat and he got into trouble. He
[1:57:24] began to sink.
[1:57:26] And brother Bradam just brought to the
[1:57:28] congregation. He says, "Maybe you're in
[1:57:31] trouble.
[1:57:33] We've tried right in the right in the uh
[1:57:36] under the commandment of God." He said,
[1:57:38] "You're right in the line of duty, but
[1:57:40] you make a mistake."
[1:57:45] And he says, "We all do." And he made a
[1:57:48] mistake, but that wasn't the end of it.
[1:57:50] Whatever it is, whatever it is, it
[1:57:54] brought him to a desperation. And he
[1:57:56] didn't say, "Now I lay me down to
[1:57:59] sleep." No. Lord,
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; save me.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; There was one thing about desperation,
[1:58:08] friends, it always has a way of
[1:58:09] expressing itself. And that's why it
[1:58:11] says when you call,
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; I tell you what,
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; it would sometimes it doesn't have to be
[1:58:22] a large volume, but it can be. I love to
[1:58:26] see when people
[1:58:29] under the under the movement of the
[1:58:31] spirit of God in all truth cry unto the
[1:58:34] Lord.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Find a quiet place or find
[1:58:38] any place or or do it here in the
[1:58:39] church. It's fine with me. When
[1:58:41] desperation connects,
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; you'll do things you never expected to
[1:58:46] do.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:51] I like to see people when they're coming
[1:58:53] to repentance. Lord, have mercy on me.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, save me.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, deliver me from this tormenting
[1:59:04] spirit.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Anybody here been under some cloud,
[1:59:10] Satan afflicting you? I'm here today to
[1:59:13] declare he doesn't have a right to you.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; That was not in God's mind. You tell him
[1:59:20] to depart from you. You tell him to He's
[1:59:23] defeated. Announce it to him. You're
[1:59:25] defeated.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you for this victory.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, deliver me now.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet said. He said
[1:59:38] that that that that brother that was so
[1:59:40] determined to receive the Holy Spirit,
[1:59:42] he said, "Fill me with the Holy Ghost.
[1:59:44] Baptize me with the Holy Ghost. And if
[1:59:46] you don't, there'll be a pile of bones
[1:59:49] here when you come back.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; That's determination.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; No. Well, we'll try again tomorrow
[2:00:02] sometime. We have such a we have such a
[2:00:10] I want you to think about the queen. I
[2:00:12] just want you to think about the queen
[2:00:14] of Sheba.
[2:00:19] Brother Brown brings her into this
[2:00:20] desperation. I'm closing now.
[2:00:25] She's not driven by trouble.
[2:00:27] I'm just repeating some things. She
[2:00:29] doesn't have mutiny in the kingdom.
[2:00:34] She hasn't got invading armies.
[2:00:38] She's not crying for a baby.
[2:00:41] She has nothing that we could identify
[2:00:45] or has been recorded nothing that would
[2:00:47] drive her to desperation.
[2:00:50] I think she should be a good example of
[2:00:52] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:00:55] All is well.
[2:00:58] I have food.
[2:01:00] I have a roof over my head.
[2:01:02] I've got family, family, friends. I got
[2:01:05] brothers, sisters.
[2:01:07] I got people that pray for me.
[2:01:10] I'm forgiven.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; I'm bloodwashed.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; I've got a message.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; God's given me a heart to hear.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; God sent me a prophet.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; God sent me his word.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; I have so much to be thankful. What
[2:01:28] about you young people?
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; I got a mom.
[2:01:33] I got a father that loves God.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; What a privilege. Maybe some of you
[2:01:39] don't, but you have spiritual moms and
[2:01:42] dads.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; We have spiritual brothers or sisters.
[2:01:47] Maybe somebody who you don't even feel
[2:01:49] very close to, but if you got into
[2:01:50] trouble, they'd be the first one to run
[2:01:52] to you, say, "What can I do?
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; Can I help you?"
[2:02:01] This woman was like that.
[2:02:05] She thought
[2:02:07] now just listen
[2:02:10] within herself she came into
[2:02:11] desperation.
[2:02:13] I must go and hear
[2:02:16] about the name of the Lord.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; Listen now close. I'm coming. I want to
[2:02:22] say something to me. It really speaks to
[2:02:24] me.
[2:02:32] I've got my gods.
[2:02:34] I've got my church. I've got my worship.
[2:02:39] I got my kingdom. I got all these
[2:02:41] things. We got all this. I got my
[2:02:44] friends. I got my husband. I got my
[2:02:46] wife. I got my parents. I got my
[2:02:48] children. I've got
[2:02:51] And we just are really comfortable with
[2:02:54] these things.
[2:02:57] There was something in her because she
[2:03:00] had heard that there was a man that had
[2:03:05] unusual wisdom.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Here we sit today.
[2:03:11] You've got the seals book, you got the
[2:03:13] church age book, their books, their
[2:03:14] discs, their tapes, whatever more. But
[2:03:17] let me say this to you in the name of
[2:03:18] the Lord. We've heard a man with unusual
[2:03:23] wisdom.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:28] And I need to not only hear about his
[2:03:30] God, but I need to know that God.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; And what was driving her? Here I'm
[2:03:38] coming to it because eternal God knew
[2:03:43] that he himself in his fullness is going
[2:03:46] to come down into one. And part of his
[2:03:48] thought was going to be transformed into
[2:03:51] substance. And that substance would be a
[2:03:54] virginborn man.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; And they would he would be called a
[2:03:58] Nazarene. And he would come and be born
[2:04:02] in a house of a of a man who was a
[2:04:05] carpenter. And he would be disdained and
[2:04:08] he would be called illegitimate and he
[2:04:11] would have he would live in a life of
[2:04:13] humility. But one day, one day he would
[2:04:17] have to stand up and be rejected by some
[2:04:20] people and he would have to utter some
[2:04:23] words. And the words would be this.
[2:04:26] The w the queen of the southmen
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; will rise up in judgment.
[2:04:35] What was happening to her even at that
[2:04:38] moment was transforming her to an
[2:04:42] individual that would go beyond
[2:04:45] judgment, stand in judgment and condemn
[2:04:48] the very men who heard the words of
[2:04:51] Jesus Christ.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; It took her, she thought she's just
[2:04:58] going to Solomon. But now here comes one
[2:05:01] who says and a greater than Solomon is
[2:05:05] here is what he said. Oh God give you
[2:05:08] revelation to understand where I'm at.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; And even in this country in this
[2:05:14] province came the same Lord Jesus Christ
[2:05:17] revealing himself in a son of man
[2:05:20] revealing the son of man. And that woman
[2:05:23] at that time had to go go there and do
[2:05:26] that to condemn that generation. and
[2:05:29] this one.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; For this messenger would stand and say
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; and declare, behold, a greater than
[2:05:41] Solomon is here.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; Not is coming is here.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; And they have their churches. They have
[2:05:50] their denominations. They have all of
[2:05:52] their beliefs. Pentecostal, Catholic,
[2:05:54] Methodist, Presbyterian, Salvation Army,
[2:05:57] and all the rest of them all here with
[2:05:58] all their theology and school. And here
[2:06:01] comes a voice out of the wilderness.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; And it echoes all the way back
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; from the book of Kings in the book of
[2:06:09] Chronicles. And the woman was moved.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; I must go.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Wasn't just to hear the wisdom of
[2:06:17] Solomon, but she must lay a track
[2:06:19] record. Yes,
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; she must lay some footsteps in the
[2:06:24] scripture
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; because God himself wanted this to be
[2:06:28] spoken in Victoria, British Columbia, a
[2:06:31] greater than Solomon is here.
[2:06:34] Hallelujah.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; And he wants a group of people in
[2:06:38] Cloverdale by the way to hear it
[2:06:41] screamed out once again. It's not just
[2:06:43] something that you fell into. It's not
[2:06:45] something you were just born into. It's
[2:06:47] not just something a friend told you.
[2:06:49] But it's because a greater than Solomon
[2:06:52] is here.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; And as he made her desperate
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; for us, it's making you desperate.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; Your opportunity for desperation.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; For someone around you,
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; desperation
[2:07:13] brings change. Amen.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; We have the musicians.
[2:07:19] We're bow
[2:07:21] prayerfully, quietly, reverently.
[2:07:26] Perhaps, Brother Rod, if you could come,
[2:07:28] I'd like to sing a song,
[2:07:34] something that I know you can sing.
[2:07:37] Let
[2:07:39] the death angel pass.
[2:07:42] God's bride
[2:07:44] safe at last.
[2:07:47] Hallelujah.
[2:07:49] Say those words with me, please. Let the
[2:07:52] death angel pass.
[2:07:55] God's bride safe at last. Hallelujah. In
[2:07:59] the token.
[2:08:01] Oh, in the token that's been made known
[2:08:04] to us in this time. Father God,
[2:08:09] how I thank you as I'm standing here
[2:08:11] behind this pull pit.
[2:08:14] Lord, I'm just
[2:08:16] being quickened and I'm quivering
[2:08:18] inside.
[2:08:20] Let me see. Let me grasp. Let these
[2:08:22] people also grasp, oh God, the depth of
[2:08:25] it that they're under they're under a
[2:08:28] banner. They're under a covering right
[2:08:30] now of a promise. And this promise has
[2:08:34] made certain declarations. The promise
[2:08:36] has been confirmed through a mouth of a
[2:08:38] vindicated prophet of God. The promise
[2:08:41] has been confirmed that it's true. It's
[2:08:43] true. It's true. And Lord, we accept it
[2:08:46] as true. We believe it is true. We give
[2:08:48] ourselves to you unreservedly.
[2:08:51] And I ask, oh God, that you'll cause
[2:08:54] this congregation of people to become
[2:08:58] may a spirit of desperation come upon
[2:09:00] them. Oh God, whatever it is that your
[2:09:03] will would be for us, I pray that we
[2:09:05] will not fail you, but that we will
[2:09:07] fulfill it. Lord, we'll fulfill it for
[2:09:10] truly, it's an evening time for us as
[2:09:13] well. Father, in Jesus Christ's name, I
[2:09:16] commit the words that have been spoken
[2:09:18] in these precious dear people, which are
[2:09:21] yours
[2:09:23] by your word of promise.
[2:09:25] Amen.
[2:09:27] Let's stand together
[2:09:29] like this. This
[2:09:36] angel
[2:09:39] [Music]
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; in the token he gave
[2:09:49] lifted up that we could be saved.
[2:09:56] Oh hallelujah
[2:10:00] and glory to God.
[2:10:06] The blessing of life, his spirit.
[2:10:11] Let the death angel pass.
[2:10:16] Brought to Moses
[2:10:21] and told him what to say.
[2:10:26] To the children of Isel
[2:10:31] in motion that day
[2:10:36] and take the blood
[2:10:40] strike close at the door
[2:10:46] for I'll pass through this night
[2:10:54] [Music]
[2:10:56] Angel
[2:11:03] [Applause]
[2:11:04] [Music]
[2:11:10] that we could be saved.
[2:11:16] Oh hallelujah.
[2:11:20] Glory to God.
[2:11:25] The blessing of life his spelit
[2:11:32] [Music]
[2:11:39] is a token today.
[2:11:44] And those who are running
[2:11:50] will be saved
[2:11:54] outside of this door.
[2:11:59] The lost will be found.
[2:12:04] If you want your love
[2:12:23] you don't
[2:12:30] Hey.
[2:12:33] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:12:38] And glory to God.
[2:12:42] [Music]
[2:12:45] His spirit arise. Let the angel pass.
[2:12:52] Brother Belco, I'd like you to come up
[2:12:53] here just a moment, please.
[2:12:57] I got an email, but I don't know exactly
[2:13:00] what,
[2:13:01] [Music]
[2:13:03] you know, what initiated that email. So,
[2:13:06] God obviously just spoke something to
[2:13:08] you, brother Melco. Just what did he
[2:13:12] what did he say? How did it come to you?
[2:13:14] Came before this message this morning.
[2:13:16] Said desperation.
[2:13:18] Desperation. Tell you better put it in
[2:13:20] your words.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Uh, well, yeah.
[2:13:25] I just realized the time we're living in
[2:13:27] and I had a
[2:13:30] burden for the family friends and I've
[2:13:33] written many letters and been very
[2:13:36] straight with with everybody that that
[2:13:39] they will come the easy or the hard way
[2:13:42] but that we also I'm praying for them. I
[2:13:45] believe for them what the prophet said,
[2:13:48] what the token is and uh I tried to tell
[2:13:52] this to my wife many times but it just
[2:13:54] didn't
[2:13:56] work. But yesterday we had a very fine
[2:13:59] day together and um uh God just opened
[2:14:03] the word and um we just spoke about
[2:14:06] these things and and I just could see
[2:14:09] that the first time that she was
[2:14:11] receiving it and um accepting it as be
[2:14:17] something is happening. She also says
[2:14:19] that she knows that the life is over
[2:14:21] that she doesn't have much longer to go
[2:14:23] and
[2:14:25] uh it's just a time I believe you know
[2:14:28] and
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; amen just an answer to a prayer that
[2:14:32] pastor speaks on desperation.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. God bless you.
[2:14:41] [Music]
[2:14:43] Now
[2:14:46] the blood's been applied.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; And the prophet could say, "You're
[2:14:52] mine."
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:56] The ones I think if he stood here, I'm
[2:14:58] not putting words in his mouth, but I
[2:15:00] think if he stood here, he'd say, "I
[2:15:02] love you."
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; You've received the word that he sent.
[2:15:08] Not my word, his word.
[2:15:11] And just before you go now,
[2:15:14] I'd like you to take a little bit of
[2:15:15] heart. We're going to sing the chorus
[2:15:17] one more time. And I'd like to see have
[2:15:21] you imagine and look down into
[2:15:25] the one of the homes of the children of
[2:15:29] Israel.
[2:15:31] And now the death angel has passed
[2:15:36] and death has
[2:15:38] covered the land.
[2:15:41] And the eldest son,
[2:15:44] he wakes up in the morning and he finds
[2:15:48] out he's alive.
[2:15:50] [Music]
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; He finds out he's alive.
[2:15:54] I don't think he if he had discourse to
[2:15:56] sing, I think he would say, "Oh,
[2:15:59] hallelujah.
[2:16:01] [Music]
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; The blood's been applied."
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; Maybe run out the door and have a look
[2:16:09] at it. Hallelujah.
[2:16:11] [Music]
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; Daddy, I'm so glad that you were
[2:16:14] faithful. I'm so glad that you obeyed.
[2:16:17] I'm so glad the prophet didn't
[2:16:19] compromise. I'm so glad we did it
[2:16:22] regardless of how foolish it looked
[2:16:24] like. But we did it. The blood's been
[2:16:26] applied. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:16:30] [Music]
[2:16:32] You think I'm wild? Wait till you see me
[2:16:34] on the other side.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; And some of you quiet, reserved people,
[2:16:39] I got to get out of your way. You're
[2:16:42] going to be so full of you say I this
[2:16:45] has been pent up for about 40 50 years
[2:16:48] down on earth I'll have to give it out
[2:16:50] right now. Well, I'm just encouraging
[2:16:52] you. Don't wait that long.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; All right, we'll sing the chorus once
[2:16:55] more. Brother Rod,
[2:16:59] let the death angel pass.
[2:17:08] [Music]
[2:17:19] [Music]
[2:17:24] and glory to God.
[2:17:28] [Music]

[2:17:43] Lord.

[2:18:26] Oh, God. How I thank you. The blood's
[2:18:29] been applied.
[2:18:31] The angel has passed. We've passed from
[2:18:34] judgment unto life. Hallelujah.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; We've already passed from judgment unto
[2:18:38] life. He shall not come into the
[2:18:41] condemnation
[2:18:42] of this past he that believed. Tonight,
[2:18:45] the day we believe, tonight we're coming
[2:18:48] to hear and to rejoice and to shout, oh
[2:18:52] God, the praises. I pray you'll inspire
