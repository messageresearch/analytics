[19:37] blood, Jesus. Lord, there is praises,
[19:40] Lord, within the sanctuary today, God,
[19:43] for our minds are going back to where we
[19:46] were when you came our way, Jesus. Lord,
[19:50] and when you begin to restore us back to
[19:52] our place in your body, and you gave us
[19:55] a new mind and took the old man and made
[19:58] us new creatures, God, and how, Lord, if
[20:01] we had a thousand lives, it would only
[20:03] begin to start, Lord, the worship that
[20:06] you deserve, Lord, and the adoration.
[20:09] But this morning, we want to lift up our
[20:11] hands and open up our mouths, God. And
[20:14] even while we receive the word, God, we
[20:16] want it to be 100% in our hearts, God.

[34:57] minister and be a part of the young
[34:58] people once again." And brother Danny
[35:00] Steam will be flying in with their
[35:02] family on Wednesday. So, we're looking
[35:03] for a wonderful time in God's presence.
[35:05] God bless you all. Amen.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Why don't we invite our pastor Biscll to
[35:14] come? And as we as he does, why don't we

[39:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Elohim.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Christ revealed to us.
[39:35] We're so thankful for everyone that is
[39:37] here to
[39:39] fellowship and worship this morning.
[39:43] Some saints from Seattle, Tacoma area, I
[39:46] believe, have come registering the
[39:49] children tomorrow. We're looking for a
[39:51] not only a great time but a mighty time
[39:55] during camp and that it the effect of it
[39:59] will continue on.
[40:02] Amen.
[40:03] God bless you all. So nice to have our
[40:06] brother Steven and sister
[40:10] Lillian Meyers with us right here in the
[40:12] front sitting beside brother
[40:17] Karen. Sister Karen and brother Doug.
[40:21] You like to just raise your hand if you
[40:23] would. These are these are some that are
[40:25] streaming all the time.
[40:28] So they with DVD or however they get it,
[40:30] but they get it.
[40:33] Amen.
[40:36] I just got an email just a little bit of
[40:39] time ago from Durban, South Africa.
[40:42] And while they were while they were
[40:44] listening to a service, I had a very
[40:46] supernatural experience.
[40:49] They said it's left them very very much
[40:52] affected.
[40:54] So, I just want you to know that it's
[40:57] what uh what people expect. Let's be in
[41:01] great expectation today. We don't want
[41:03] to leave it. We don't have any guarantee
[41:05] about tomorrow
[41:07] or this evening. Nice to see Brother
[41:09] Gary, Sister Lisa back. God bless you.
[41:13] Also, Brother Joseph and Sister Anita,
[41:15] nice to see you back. Amen.
[41:18] Praise the Lord. We miss you. You may
[41:20] think, we don't miss you. Thank you,
[41:22] brother Kyle, for the prayer meeting
[41:24] report. I'd love to have been there. I
[41:27] said there was 65 to 75 people and just
[41:30] pack the chapel right out. Well, I hope
[41:33] they pack it out and move on into the
[41:35] fellowship room. Amen.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:42] Uh,
[41:46] Brother Timothy Anatoo
[41:48] is back with us. He He He's like the
[41:52] wind.
[41:55] I don't hear he's coming and then I just
[41:57] hear he's here.
[42:00] Nice to have you, brother Timothy. And I
[42:02] know your family's happy.
[42:04] We can't welcome everyone. I just met
[42:07] Brother Abel from Mexico arrived.
[42:12] Well, we welcome everyone.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[42:18] Hallelujah.
[42:21] Hallelujah.
[42:25] We also welcomed
[42:27] three more children into
[42:30] into the world. Uh Sharon gave birth to
[42:33] triplets and they're healthy and mother
[42:35] and children are well and we're happy
[42:38] for that. They were all over four
[42:40] pounds. I don't get too precise because
[42:43] I just don't get too much into it, but
[42:46] they're here. And uh so I said God must
[42:50] have some plan. Uh this is the last
[42:53] thing in the world that I ever expected
[42:55] I had experienced. And someone sent a
[42:58] greetings to my wife and I and said it
[43:00] must be quite a a feeling to be a
[43:04] greatgrandparents three times in one
[43:06] day. And I sent it back and said, "How
[43:09] about three times in one minute?"
[43:13] So, we're we're delighted and and we
[43:17] just uh are thankful. We I want them to
[43:20] be a a credit to the gospel of Jesus
[43:23] Christ. Amen. Maybe we could just sing
[43:26] this again and then we'll go right to
[43:29] the word.
[43:32] I lift
[43:35] your handy
[43:42] Hey,
[43:44] [Music]
[44:04] [Music]
[44:08] my comfort
[44:13] and heavenly king.
[44:18] Go in prayer. Dear father,
[44:22] how we thank you for this day, the
[44:25] Lord's day. And we want indeed it to be
[44:29] the Lord's day. We pray that you'll
[44:31] receive all the glory, all the praise,
[44:35] for you alone are worthy. Take your word
[44:38] now, oh God, and I pray you'll divide it
[44:41] and break it down to the people. And may
[44:44] they and may we all be so attentive and
[44:49] listening to the voice of the spirit.
[44:52] Speak to us, oh bridegroom,
[44:54] husband, Lord Jesus. I pray, Father,
[44:58] you'll take this congregation and bring
[45:00] them into one mind. Yes, Lord.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Remove every hindrance.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Remove every enemy that would try to sew
[45:07] a thought, oh God, and purge us and
[45:12] cleanse us, oh Father, that we might
[45:15] stand in the holy presence of the
[45:17] Almighty God. In the name of Jesus
[45:20] Christ, we ask it. Open your word now.
[45:22] We pray for you are the author. We thank
[45:25] you
[45:27] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[45:31] I'd ask you to open your Bibles to
[45:34] Matthew the 21st chapter.
[45:43] I would like your undivided attention
[45:47] and as little movement as possible
[45:50] in the congregation.
[45:53] Uh,
[45:56] I have something that I want to I'm
[45:58] going to be speaking part three on
[46:01] receiving him, but
[46:04] I the the title really doesn't do
[46:07] justice to the thought that I'm been
[46:10] seeking to convey to you. And we've
[46:13] taken two services or three. And now I
[46:16] want to
[46:18] I want to bring something to you that I
[46:20] think is uh really critical to the body
[46:24] of Jesus Christ to the bride of Jesus
[46:26] Christ and and it's uh more or less
[46:30] towards the teaching side rather than
[46:33] the preaching side which is brother Bram
[46:36] talks about teachings being quite
[46:38] treacherous
[46:39] and uh because sometimes you have to uh
[46:43] say something and then you almost
[46:46] overcompensate to get people up, you
[46:49] know, to this point. And so then, but
[46:52] people are quick in their mind. They
[46:54] catch the over compensated statement,
[46:57] say, "Wow, you know, it's way over
[46:59] there." And and almost go off on a on a
[47:02] limb, but and I don't want that to
[47:05] happen either. So, that's kind of what
[47:08] I'm a little bit cautious about. But uh
[47:11] you pray for me
[47:12] &gt;&gt; and pray also God will just give you
[47:15] clear understanding the purpose of the
[47:18] service this service and the previous
[47:20] services the reason why I say I believe
[47:22] it's critical is for this reason
[47:25] the I believe that there's an element
[47:28] within the message
[47:31] that I'm going to seek to move to and
[47:34] that is that if we really realized who's
[47:38] amongst us if we really realized that
[47:43] God
[47:45] the creator of heavens and earth has
[47:47] come
[47:48] and in a form and has brought as has
[47:51] come down in such a way so that he can
[47:53] indwell us and that this ministry which
[47:58] we have received we've been birthed
[48:00] under this ministry of the seventh angel
[48:04] the seventh messenger and and I know
[48:07] that we agree and we accept accept it
[48:09] and we believe it in in our hearts. I I
[48:12] I don't want to be like some that
[48:14] Brother Brandham said they're they're
[48:15] trying so hard to believe. I don't want
[48:17] to be trying to believe. I want to be
[48:19] believing.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; I just want to have and have you to have
[48:24] simple childlike faith. Just believe it
[48:27] and and give yourself to it completely
[48:31] because we we're not here, friends, just
[48:33] to get through this Sunday and go into
[48:35] camp or whatever more. We might not even
[48:38] have camp. We could pass uh we could
[48:40] pass beyond this realm
[48:42] &gt;&gt; into eternal shore in a moment's notice
[48:46] and uh individually or collectively. So
[48:49] we just want to uh I want to try to
[48:53] bring this subject to you because I
[48:56] believe it is the key to receiving
[48:59] supernatural things.
[49:02] And I believe that often supernatural
[49:05] things were not taking place and do not
[49:09] take place because people do not respect
[49:12] and give honor to the one who's amongst
[49:14] us who's none other than Jesus Christ.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; And so God help us as we read. Now I'm
[49:21] going to start Matthew 21 and starting
[49:24] with verse 33
[49:27] here. Another parable. There was a
[49:29] certain householder which planted a
[49:31] vineyard and hedged it around about and
[49:35] digged a wine press in it and built a
[49:37] tower and led it out to husbandmen and
[49:40] went into a for country. And when the
[49:42] time of the fruit drew near, he sent his
[49:44] servants to the husbandmen
[49:47] and that they might receive the fruits
[49:48] of it. And the husbandman took his
[49:50] servants and beat one and killed another
[49:52] and stoned another. Again, he sent other
[49:55] servants, more than the first, and they
[49:57] did unto them likewise. But last of all,
[50:00] he sent unto them his son, saying, "This
[50:04] will reverence my son." But when the
[50:07] husbandmen saw the son, they said unto
[50:10] they said among themselves, "This is the
[50:12] heir. Come, let us kill him, and let us
[50:15] seize on his inheritance." And they
[50:17] caught him, and cast him out of the
[50:19] vineyard, and slew him. And when the
[50:21] Lord therefore of the vineyard cometh,
[50:24] what will he do unto those husbandmen?
[50:27] They say unto him, he will miserably
[50:30] destroy those wicked men, and will let
[50:33] out his vineyard unto other hus under
[50:35] husbandmen, which shall render unto him
[50:38] the fruits in their seasons. Jesus sth
[50:41] unto them, did you never read in the
[50:43] scriptures, the stone which the builders
[50:46] re rejected, the same has become the
[50:48] head of the corner? This is the Lord's
[50:50] doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.
[50:54] Therefore say I unto you, the kingdom of
[50:56] God shall be taken from you and given to
[50:58] a nation bringing forth the fruits
[51:00] thereof. And whosoever shall fall on
[51:03] this stone shall be broken, but on
[51:05] whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind
[51:08] him to powder.
[51:11] And when the chief priests and Pharisees
[51:13] had heard the the his parables, they
[51:16] perceived that he spake of them. And
[51:19] when they sought to lay hands on him,
[51:21] they feared the multitude because they
[51:24] took him for a prophet down to verse 46.
[51:30] I want also and you could turn please to
[51:33] John the 8th chapter. I want to read
[51:35] verse 24
[51:38] and then I will go to John 9 and read
[51:41] nine and John 13 and read verse 19.
[51:58] John 8 and 24.
[52:05] I said therefore unto you
[52:08] that you shall die in your sins.
[52:11] For if you believe not that I am he, you
[52:15] shall die in your sins. I'd like you to
[52:17] notice that strange
[52:19] phrase.
[52:21] If you
[52:23] uh if you believe not that I am he, it's
[52:29] like speaking of two individuals that I
[52:33] who you see I whoever you regard me to
[52:36] be am he. whoever that was, whoever they
[52:40] thought that was a and and whoever they
[52:44] were taught that that was if you don't
[52:46] believe that I am he. Amen.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; So it's it's it's a bit of a relative
[52:51] statement. And then in John 9 and9 he
[52:54] said some said this is he
[52:58] others said he is like him. But he said
[53:03] I am he.
[53:06] That pretty well covers the crowd.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; This is he.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Others said, "No, he's like him." But he
[53:15] said, "I am he."
[53:17] &gt;&gt; In John 13:19, he said, "Now I tell you
[53:20] before it come that when it is come to
[53:23] pass, you may believe that I am he."
[53:28] I'll read it again. Some of you still
[53:31] finding it. Now I tell you before it
[53:33] come to pass
[53:36] uh I tell you before it come that when
[53:39] it come to pass you may believe that I
[53:43] am he.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; You may have your seats.
[53:55] The scripture which we read, the
[53:57] scripture reading
[54:00] said, "But last of all he sent his son."
[54:05] Last of all, he sent his beloved.
[54:09] And they were looking upon him.
[54:12] So, you'll just have to be labor. You'll
[54:15] allow me to belabor this point for a
[54:17] while. They were looking on him and they
[54:20] said, "Uh, this is Joseph's son." Which
[54:23] he wasn't Joseph's son, but they thought
[54:26] he was Joseph's son. This is Joseph and
[54:28] Mary's son. But but he was saying,
[54:32] "Whoever you think I if you think I'm
[54:36] Joseph's son or Mary's son or or an
[54:40] illegitimate child or whatever you think
[54:42] I am, but I am he. And if you don't
[54:45] believe that I am he, you're going to
[54:47] die in your unbelief or die in your
[54:49] sins.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; That was that was the powerful point
[54:54] that he was making.
[54:56] And at the and last of all, after all of
[55:00] these servants, after all of the
[55:02] prophets and the seers and the sages of
[55:05] the Old Testament, and then finally the
[55:09] spirit of Elijah coming again, and John
[55:12] the Baptist preaching with such, I won't
[55:16] even say vigor, but such power of the
[55:18] Holy Spirit and people being drawn to
[55:22] it. And then he said, "But there is one
[55:25] among you."
[55:27] And uh I'm not worthy to do his shoe
[55:31] latch
[55:34] and and he I baptize you with water, but
[55:36] he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[55:39] and power. Now, it it hadn't happened in
[55:43] Holy Ghost and fire. It hadn't happened
[55:46] with others of the uh others of the
[55:50] servants where they got confused. So
[55:52] they asked him if he was Christ. Some of
[55:55] these things you've heard me say perhaps
[55:57] a number of times. They asked him if he
[56:01] was Christ.
[56:03] Never heard. It's never written that
[56:05] they asked Elijah if he was or rather
[56:08] Isaiah if he was Christ or Ezekiel if he
[56:10] was Christ or Jeremiah if he was Christ.
[56:13] And here come John the Baptist. Not
[56:15] really considered as one of the major
[56:17] prophets. But are you Christ? There's
[56:20] something about that spirit of Elijah
[56:24] that and the reason why there's
[56:26] something about it is because God has
[56:28] chosen that spirit as a forerunning
[56:31] spirit
[56:32] &gt;&gt; and a restoring spirit.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; And then when Jesus
[56:36] came on the scene, then they wanted to
[56:38] know if he was John the Baptist. John
[56:42] the Baptist is raised up. Always getting
[56:44] those two confused. And then
[56:48] last of all, after seven church ages,
[56:51] after seven church ages comes the last
[56:54] messenger. There's not another one.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; There is not another one. I've got some
[57:00] quotes I'm going to have you read with
[57:01] me very slowly.
[57:05] And last of all, he sent his son.
[57:10] Now I have a I have a slide here that I
[57:14] want to
[57:16] uh
[57:18] and before I put the slide up, I'm
[57:21] interested in the I'm interested in the
[57:24] construction of the message. I'm
[57:27] interested in how God ordered it. I
[57:31] think that's important. We as children,
[57:34] we expect to have, you know, more
[57:36] serious conversation as we get older,
[57:40] more responsibility
[57:42] and and uh experience uh more things uh
[57:46] within the family and uh and as as the
[57:51] as the message matured and not the
[57:54] message so much maturing, but as the
[57:57] bride of Jesus Christ, you know, we talk
[58:00] about the earlier messages and the
[58:02] evangelistic tapes and so on and so
[58:04] forth. But then and there were such
[58:08] multitudes that came at that time. But
[58:10] then as the ministry begin to get down
[58:14] to what we call the opening of the word,
[58:17] the the crowds were much smaller. You
[58:20] don't hear of two and three and 400,000
[58:23] people. You know, it's a few hundred
[58:25] people. And some of the messages which
[58:28] you hear and even treasure were in a
[58:30] house where maybe there was 30 people or
[58:32] 40 people. But the but the message that
[58:35] came out of there was absolutely
[58:37] profound.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; And so
[58:43] in the in 33 years of ministry
[58:48] uh I wanted to find out when brother
[58:49] Brandham began to refer to Revelation
[58:53] 107.
[58:55] And if I type that in and do a search on
[58:58] it, uh I find that he used it 18 times
[59:03] and that was in the last three years.
[59:07] So for perhaps 30 years it's not
[59:10] referred to but in the last 3 years it
[59:14] becomes referred to and the first time
[59:16] that I can find it is in sers is this
[59:20] the time
[59:22] and that's the first time that I find
[59:25] him referring to and he says now listen
[59:28] close
[59:30] the seventh angel of revelation 10:7 is
[59:34] the seventh church age messenger
[59:36] &gt;&gt; now I know that
[59:38] &gt;&gt; these appear in the church ages and that
[59:40] the church ages were being uh
[59:43] grammarized and put together into into
[59:46] the book that we know as the church ages
[59:48] over a period of time and and the
[59:50] prophet spoke the revelation of the the
[59:53] revelation of the uh church ages the
[59:56] revelation of Jesus Christ series and
[59:58] that is back from 19 about 6061 in there
[1:00:02] I believe and he's speaking that at that
[1:00:05] time but then when it is put together in
[1:00:07] a book which doesn't come out till 1965.
[1:00:10] In fact, it's about the 8th month of
[1:00:12] 1965.
[1:00:14] The book is released and brother uh
[1:00:17] brother Lee Vale had done a tremendous
[1:00:19] amount of work on it and it was done.
[1:00:21] Brother Brandon speaks very highly of
[1:00:23] the book. Some discredit it. I do not. I
[1:00:26] think that it covers the major messages,
[1:00:29] the major doctrines of the message in a
[1:00:32] very very appropriate way. And it's a
[1:00:34] wonderful way that the at least the
[1:00:36] message is introduced.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; And he says in the seventh angel of
[1:00:40] revelation 10:7 is a seventh church age
[1:00:44] messenger. Then in the fourth seal we
[1:00:46] find out that that eagle age was
[1:00:50] promised in Revelations 10:7. And in
[1:00:52] Malachi 1:4
[1:00:55] uh that would be in the last days that
[1:00:57] it would be here. also in the fourth
[1:01:00] seal. He said, "We could we could uh uh
[1:01:04] we could just give you scripture after
[1:01:06] scripture that the last age is a
[1:01:09] prophetic message to the church calling
[1:01:12] them back to the original word."
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; We don't have to have 10 messengers
[1:01:18] doing that.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; This messenger was ordained and
[1:01:22] vindicated of God.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; No one had that kind of vindication. And
[1:01:27] it's the vindication which separates it
[1:01:29] from everything else.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; I don't have that vindication. No other
[1:01:33] minister I know of in the message, there
[1:01:35] hasn't been anybody before him and
[1:01:37] nobody since him that's had that. And
[1:01:40] when I say before him, I'm going all the
[1:01:42] way back. As far as I'm concerned, I
[1:01:44] don't find anything from Adam forward
[1:01:46] that had the Lord Jesus Christ. You say,
[1:01:48] "What about the Lord Jesus Christ?" The
[1:01:50] Lord Jesus Christ in his in his very
[1:01:54] localized area uh in uh in in Palestine
[1:01:59] did all of those things. But then he did
[1:02:01] say greater than this. And the prophet
[1:02:03] said you couldn't do greater. He raised
[1:02:05] the dead, brought life back. Couldn't do
[1:02:07] greater but greater in numbers, greater
[1:02:09] in quantity because he knew that at the
[1:02:11] end time. And so Malachi 4 said so and
[1:02:14] others. And he says Revelation 10 and 7.
[1:02:19] He goes on, perhaps some are here and
[1:02:21] are younger ones. Listen close. He said,
[1:02:23] "The first Elijah was him." In other
[1:02:25] words, Elijah. The first one was him,
[1:02:28] Elijah the Tishbite. The first Elijah
[1:02:31] was him. The second was Elisha. The
[1:02:34] third was John. The fourth was the
[1:02:37] seventh angel to the last messenger uh
[1:02:41] the angel or the last messenger to the
[1:02:43] church according to Malachi 4. That was
[1:02:46] the fourth. In Revelations 10:7, the
[1:02:50] fifth time he is a messenger to the
[1:02:52] Jews, to the 144,000, to the Jews after
[1:02:56] the church is gone.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; So those are the five times. There isn't
[1:03:01] another one.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; There isn't anything that has to rise to
[1:03:04] be something of a extraordinary measure.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; There's no personal. We're not going to
[1:03:09] get into personality cults. That's what
[1:03:12] Pentecost died on
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; was this great minister and that great
[1:03:16] minister and some other great minister.
[1:03:19] This message is the one that has been
[1:03:21] sent to call us.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; And the souls that are in prison now
[1:03:28] we're into 63. It was to be the seventh
[1:03:31] angel's message that was to reveal the
[1:03:34] seven seals. Revelation 10:7. So the
[1:03:38] seventh angel's message was to reveal
[1:03:40] the seven seals. There isn't anyone else
[1:03:42] coming to reveal them. That messenger
[1:03:44] was sent to reveal them.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; We may read it. We may hear it. We may
[1:03:48] listen to the tapes or whatever more and
[1:03:50] may not catch the revelation of it, but
[1:03:53] it's been opened according to the
[1:03:55] promise of God.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; And uh and he saw this angel come down.
[1:04:00] Oh, now watch this closely. And he saw
[1:04:03] this angel come down, put his foot on
[1:04:05] the land and on the sea. He said that
[1:04:07] was Christ had a rainbow over his head.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; In works his faith expressed the works
[1:04:13] that the Holy Spirit is doing today by
[1:04:15] these visions never failing. Promises
[1:04:18] never failing. All the apostolic signs
[1:04:21] promised in the Bible of Malachi 4 and
[1:04:24] Revelation 10:7. All of that is being
[1:04:27] fulfilled and proved by the scientific
[1:04:30] and every other way in the rapture. And
[1:04:33] these seven seals was not to be opened.
[1:04:36] Revelation 10 until the sounding of the
[1:04:38] last earthly angel on earth. Revelation
[1:04:42] 10:7. And in the days of the sounding of
[1:04:44] the last angel's message, seventh angel,
[1:04:47] the mystery of God should be finished.
[1:04:50] And that was the age that we're living
[1:04:52] in. We all know we're living in the
[1:04:54] Leodysia age and that and there will
[1:04:58] never be an another age to it. It can't
[1:05:02] be.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Continuing in rapture. I wasn't planning
[1:05:07] on this, but it sounds like you're
[1:05:09] catching enjoying it. Now, here also a
[1:05:12] type of the seven church ages, which is
[1:05:15] Revelation 10:7. that the great mystery
[1:05:17] of the book was to be unfolded by the
[1:05:21] seventh angel's message.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; That book's unfolded by the seventh
[1:05:27] angel's message.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Not an eighth or seven and a half or
[1:05:31] somebody else. By the seventh angel's
[1:05:34] message, it'll be unfolded
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; in modern events made clear. Now coming
[1:05:39] to the last services, the very last
[1:05:42] services
[1:05:44] to see Jesus himself there in the skies
[1:05:48] looking down. And that's the cloud,
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; the the testimony, the testament, the
[1:05:56] evidence that the seals were to be
[1:05:58] opened to see Jesus himself there in the
[1:06:02] skies looking down and saying that in
[1:06:06] the in the Revelations 10:7 in the
[1:06:09] seventh angel's message, these seals
[1:06:12] would be opened and the mysteries of God
[1:06:14] would be made known. Amen.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; And then a number of times in the
[1:06:19] Pergamanian church age and the Leodysian
[1:06:22] church age and so on. Uh quite a number
[1:06:25] uh a few more times. Then I also wanted
[1:06:29] to see the references made to Revelation
[1:06:32] 10:1
[1:06:34] which was the which we know is Christ
[1:06:37] which he has said clearly as Christ and
[1:06:40] he said, "Oh, it's a great plan." And
[1:06:41] this is the first sale. It was in less
[1:06:45] than 3 years in about 2 years and 8
[1:06:48] months that he made the reference to
[1:06:50] Revelation 10:1 and not before that.
[1:06:53] Why? It wasn't for them.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; It wasn't for them.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't have received it. They
[1:07:03] wouldn't have believed it.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; They wanted signs and healings and all
[1:07:07] kinds of things. And not that those are
[1:07:09] gone.
[1:07:11] that that God can never stop being a
[1:07:13] healer.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; And there are people today that want to
[1:07:18] revert right back and say, "Well, we,
[1:07:21] you know, this is a the gifts are coming
[1:07:23] in. Gifts are coming in." I saw people
[1:07:26] backslide under that. I saw people with
[1:07:29] all kinds of gifts and prophecies and
[1:07:31] interpretations and tongues and healings
[1:07:33] and supernatural things happening, but
[1:07:36] when the word came, they refused it.
[1:07:41] So,
[1:07:42] and and and he's he he only refers to
[1:07:45] that I can find and I'm not saying this
[1:07:47] is that's why I'm being very careful.
[1:07:50] Revelation 10 and1
[1:07:54] five times in about 2 years and 8 months
[1:07:57] and that's the last two years and 8
[1:07:59] months. Now that might not mean anything
[1:08:02] to you but it means a whole lot to me.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I say now you know uh I'm just
[1:08:10] thinking of a a young man I knew he
[1:08:12] wanted me to adopt him actually. He
[1:08:14] wanted to come here and live and and uh
[1:08:18] his father was uh very very unusual man
[1:08:22] in in South Africa and down in the Cape
[1:08:25] Town area.
[1:08:28] And uh I don't know why this comes to my
[1:08:30] mind right now, but
[1:08:33] uh his this boy's father had a little
[1:08:39] building at the at the back of the lot
[1:08:41] to their place and no one was allowed in
[1:08:45] that building. That's where he went and
[1:08:46] prayed and talked to God.
[1:08:50] And one day he said to his son, he said,
[1:08:52] "Now I want you to come with me."
[1:08:55] and he took him into that prayer chamber
[1:08:59] and sat him down. He said, "Now, son,"
[1:09:02] he said, "you're 16
[1:09:04] and uh
[1:09:08] here." And he reached he said, "Here's
[1:09:10] the keys to the car
[1:09:14] and I want you to take care of mommy."
[1:09:19] He said, "Well,
[1:09:21] this language he hadn't heard before."
[1:09:24] What? What do you mean take care of
[1:09:25] mommy? He said, 'Well, now you're a man.
[1:09:29] You're not a You're not just a boy
[1:09:31] anymore. You're a man, and you have to
[1:09:34] take man's responsibilities.
[1:09:37] What? What? What's happening? Where are
[1:09:38] you going? He said, "No, it's fine.
[1:09:42] Daddy's going to be leaving, but I want
[1:09:44] you to take and he he took a box. And he
[1:09:49] said, "Here's all the payments of the
[1:09:50] car, and there's only one or two
[1:09:53] payments left to make." And so that he
[1:09:56] put everything in order. This boy, I
[1:09:59] mean, I talked to him. I know this
[1:10:01] family. And I know this pastor. I know
[1:10:04] this brother.
[1:10:06] And I don't know whether it was that day
[1:10:08] or the next day, he just gave up the
[1:10:10] ghost and went to be with the Lord.
[1:10:13] And then then the boy knew what he was
[1:10:15] saying and knew why he was saying it. In
[1:10:18] other words, there are times if we look
[1:10:22] to really see what he said. There are
[1:10:26] things that really need to be absorbed.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; There are things in the message that we
[1:10:31] can say, you know, I maybe don't fully
[1:10:33] understand that. But there comes a time
[1:10:37] within our church, within our spiritual
[1:10:40] walk. We say, "It's time for me to come
[1:10:43] to grips with that.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; It's time for me to deal with that." And
[1:10:50] so that is kind of where I'm coming
[1:10:52] right now. Last of all, he sent his son.
[1:10:55] There was the apostles and there was the
[1:10:57] reformers and there was a church age.
[1:11:00] And then finally comes the spirit of
[1:11:02] Elijah
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; to do an introduction.
[1:11:06] And he does an introduction. And I'm
[1:11:08] afraid many times those who associate
[1:11:10] with the message don't catch the
[1:11:13] introduction or don't catch who he's
[1:11:16] actually introducing.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; But friends, we have had a marriage. We
[1:11:22] have had a union. and those that
[1:11:26] recognize really what happened.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; I can tell you that in today's economy,
[1:11:30] there's a lot of people that come to the
[1:11:33] altar and go through a marriage
[1:11:35] ceremony, but they don't understand what
[1:11:37] a marriage is all about.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; They don't understand when the scripture
[1:11:42] says the two are no longer twain. They
[1:11:44] are one.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; But they don't understand that. And and
[1:11:51] that's that's just the age that we're
[1:11:53] in.
[1:11:55] And so now I have uh
[1:12:07] this is in the seventh seal.
[1:12:11] Now, when that gets on tape,
[1:12:14] which it is, that'll probably send
[1:12:17] 10,000 of my friends away from me
[1:12:20] because they're going to say, notice
[1:12:23] now, they're going to say that brother
[1:12:25] Brandham's trying to put himself or make
[1:12:29] himself a servant or a prophet or
[1:12:32] something before God. And let me tell
[1:12:35] you, my brother, my brethren, that is an
[1:12:38] error. I'm only telling you what I seen
[1:12:42] and what has been told to me. And now
[1:12:45] you do whatever you want to.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; I don't know what's going to take place.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; I do not know. I just know that those
[1:12:54] seven thunders holds that mystery and
[1:12:58] heavens was quieted. Everybody
[1:13:01] understand? Now uh
[1:13:07] this is what I have underlined. It may
[1:13:10] be time. This is the continuing of the
[1:13:12] same paragraph. It may be time. It may
[1:13:16] be the hour now that this great person
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; that we're expecting to rise on the
[1:13:23] scene may rise on the scene. Maybe this
[1:13:27] ministry that I have tried to take
[1:13:29] people back to the word has laid a
[1:13:32] foundation. And if it has, I'll be
[1:13:36] leaving you for good. There won't be two
[1:13:39] of us here at the same time. See, if it
[1:13:43] is, and then he uses the same words John
[1:13:46] the Baptist uses while he was living and
[1:13:48] Christ was there. the two of them there
[1:13:51] says he he will he he will increase and
[1:13:55] I will decrease
[1:13:56] [Music]
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; and that's what had to happen
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; and so from the seals on the messages
[1:14:05] are coming but but the prophet's
[1:14:07] ministry is decreasing
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; and there is another one
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; who is present
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; who I am troubled because many in the
[1:14:19] message. Don't see him
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; when you refer to this Christ. They have
[1:14:26] someone back from the Sea of Galilee and
[1:14:29] back from Palestine and so on. It's
[1:14:31] another one. And it's not it is the same
[1:14:34] one. It is the same one, but he's not in
[1:14:37] that ministry. He's in this ministry.
[1:14:40] He's not back there revealing himself to
[1:14:43] Jews. And he even said, "Don't go to the
[1:14:46] Gentiles. don't just go to the lost
[1:14:48] sheep of the house of Israel. But he's
[1:14:50] not saying that now. Now it's a
[1:14:53] different age. It's a different time.
[1:14:54] It's a different season and there's
[1:14:56] another one. There can't be two of us.
[1:14:59] He said at the same time.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; And if you can believe there are others
[1:15:02] who try to raise up and infer that maybe
[1:15:06] it's their ministry that brother Brandon
[1:15:07] was referring to. And I just say
[1:15:09] nonsense.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Absolute nonsense.
[1:15:13] Why would why would God why would God
[1:15:17] send a uh such a vindicated messenger to
[1:15:21] to introduce somebody who has no
[1:15:23] vindication?
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; I say, you know, I'm weary with it.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; And I just say, nonsense.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; There is no other hero. There is no
[1:15:33] other ministry.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Absolute nonsense.
[1:15:38] There is another one and it's Jesus
[1:15:40] Christ.
[1:15:43] And if we could recognize fully who he
[1:15:46] is
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; in the fullness, if we could recognize
[1:15:50] that this congregation could recognize
[1:15:53] who is amongst us, you'd see things you
[1:15:55] didn't even believe could happen.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; He wants to do it.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; He wants to manifest himself.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; But much of it lays back on us.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; On who do you say this is?
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; What do you think of him?
[1:16:16] Thank you.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; In the very day, carrying on with the
[1:16:23] same this fine line, this razor's edge
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; between the two,
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; this razor's edge as it was between the
[1:16:32] spirit of Elijah and Christ himself.
[1:16:35] Just accept it. If you don't say it,
[1:16:37] just accept it and then follow on and
[1:16:39] see how the word will speak to you.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; In the very day that the son of man is
[1:16:45] revealed.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; That's Christ. In the very day that the
[1:16:49] son of man, Jesus Christ is revealed.
[1:16:51] Revelations 10:1-7.
[1:16:54] The seventh angel's message opening up
[1:16:57] the seals. He said, "What is it? Not the
[1:17:01] angel is the son of man." In other
[1:17:04] words, he's saying, "Not me. I'm not the
[1:17:06] son of man, but the messenger is
[1:17:09] revealing the son of man. And can you
[1:17:12] get that separated?
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; That was the point. Can you get it
[1:17:19] separated?
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Now, he said that's where it seems to be
[1:17:24] so hard for you. And that's why Jesus
[1:17:28] when he was here, he was saying, "Unless
[1:17:30] you believe that I am he,
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; excuse me.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe that I am he,
[1:17:39] you'll die in your sin.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. I'll say to the believers
[1:17:45] of the message, unless you believe that
[1:17:47] this one who this messenger revealed is
[1:17:50] he and there isn't another,
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; we'll we'll just wither on the vine.
[1:17:58] [Applause]
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; We'll end up being a powerless church.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; The church that God hates.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; We don't want that.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Not when he's present to. In fact,
[1:18:14] invite us in. And I feel that's what
[1:18:16] these services are all about.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; I'm pouring my heart out to you now,
[1:18:20] friends.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; If this were my last message, this is
[1:18:28] the one I want it to be.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; I want to speak of him.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's where it seems to be so
[1:18:36] hard for you. Not that the son of man
[1:18:39] himself,
[1:18:41] but that the seventh angel, the seventh
[1:18:44] messenger, is revealing to the public
[1:18:47] the son of man.
[1:18:49] It's being revealed to the public. The
[1:18:52] son of man because it's left the shock.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; The life has left the shock. The life
[1:18:58] has left the leodysan
[1:19:01] because it has left the shock. He can't
[1:19:03] organize it. It's the grain itself
[1:19:06] again. Brother Brandham couldn't even
[1:19:07] organize it cuz it can't be organized.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; And that's not just, you know, do you
[1:19:18] think so? It is the grain has left the
[1:19:21] shock.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; It has left the shock.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; The life has left the shock.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it can't be organized.
[1:19:31] [Applause]
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:39] Amen.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Here's where it's hard. It's where it's
[1:19:42] hard to get separated.
[1:19:44] That the veil is the flesh.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; The veil, William Brandham's veil
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; is the flesh.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Your veil is your flesh.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; And the veil is what keeps us from
[1:19:57] seeing God
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; face to face in this church. Amen.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; The veil is what keeps us from seeing
[1:20:06] the angels
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; at their positions
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; this morning.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; This morning,
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; your flesh,
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; your veil is the problem.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; My veil is your problem. Your veil is
[1:20:23] your own problem. And our veils are our
[1:20:26] problem.
[1:20:28] [Applause]
[1:20:30] Hallelujah.
[1:20:32] [Music]
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Keeps us from seeing God face to face
[1:20:36] from the angels in their positions this
[1:20:38] morning standing by their seat by the
[1:20:40] seats. The veil is what keeps us from
[1:20:43] seeing him.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Unless you believe that I
[1:20:48] am him,
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; but it was the veil in that day and it's
[1:20:54] the veil in this day."
[1:20:56] And this same messenger who was
[1:20:58] revealing him said he's now in his
[1:21:01] bride.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; He isn't his people.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; And our problem is the veil.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; The veil is weak.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; The flesh is weak.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; You can't make it strong because it's
[1:21:14] weak.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; It'll never be strong.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; The spirit is willing, but the flesh is
[1:21:21] weak. That's right.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; If you wait for the flesh to get strong,
[1:21:25] you're going to miss it.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; You're going to miss what God has in
[1:21:29] store for you.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; I am what I am. Apostle Paul said,
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; am
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; we are what we are.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Are we not to seek to improve ourselves?
[1:21:40] Yes. Crucify the flesh. Do whatever you
[1:21:43] need to do. But the thing is, don't hold
[1:21:45] up the program of God in your life.
[1:21:48] Because some of us are waiting for till
[1:21:50] we can do it and you can't do it. You
[1:21:52] got to let him do it.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; He's the only one who can do it.
[1:21:58] [Music]
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; And this has been the problem. But last
[1:22:04] of all, he sent his son. And when he
[1:22:08] sent his son, they thought he was
[1:22:11] whether he thought he was a, as I've
[1:22:13] said in the previous services, a good
[1:22:15] teacher, a rabbi, a this or that, or
[1:22:17] whatever thing. You know, here when they
[1:22:20] send the messenger comes in this time
[1:22:23] and the prophet of God comes in this
[1:22:25] time, says, "Oh, he's a man of God.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; He's a prophet." And feeling that those
[1:22:32] were complimentary, they were, but it
[1:22:34] wasn't sufficient. Amen.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Then when he came, when he was telling
[1:22:39] them plainly, I'm here to introduce
[1:22:41] another one.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; And if they would have read and heard
[1:22:45] the voice, they would have heard him
[1:22:47] say, there can't be two of us here at
[1:22:49] the same time. He didn't say it many
[1:22:51] times, but once is enough.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; And that's the critical spot. That's the
[1:22:58] razor edge right there.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Who do you say this is?
[1:23:08] Now the message and the messenger are
[1:23:12] one.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Now they now it gets to be such a fine
[1:23:16] razor's edge. The message and the
[1:23:19] messenger and I've heard it being used
[1:23:21] improperly to convince people that
[1:23:24] brother Brandham was something that he
[1:23:25] says clearly he wasn't.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; He was a messenger. He couldn't say it
[1:23:30] plainer. He's a son of man revealing the
[1:23:33] son of man. But it was the veil, the
[1:23:35] veil of that flesh which was the problem
[1:23:38] because people were trying to decipher
[1:23:40] the two. Don't try to decipher. Just
[1:23:42] take it what he said. Yeah.
[1:23:46] [Applause]
[1:23:47] [Music]
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; And and we want to be thankful
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; that God allowed us to come to such an
[1:23:54] age
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; when we had such a messenger
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; where we could scarcely tell
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; who it was.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; One time he's in the eternities and the
[1:24:04] next time he's here and one time he's
[1:24:06] hunting and the next time he's in the
[1:24:09] heavenlies someplace. Amen.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; What kind of a person was it when Jesus
[1:24:14] said in John the 3rd chapter, even the
[1:24:16] son of man which is in heaven.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, put yourself there
[1:24:21] standing there with him. Was he in
[1:24:22] heaven? He said he was.
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:26] [Applause]
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; What about the prophet messenger that
[1:24:30] said many times over and over and over
[1:24:33] again, I'm standing in two worlds?
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Which world is it? One is yours and one
[1:24:38] is the eternal one.
[1:24:41] One is the one where our knowledge is so
[1:24:43] limited and the other one is unlimited.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; This one we only understand in the
[1:24:50] present term. And then the other one
[1:24:52] that he was standing in, he tell them
[1:24:53] what was yesterday and what was right
[1:24:56] now and what they were going to
[1:24:57] experience when they went home.
[1:25:00] [Applause]
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; What kind of a messenger is that? The
[1:25:04] reason why it was so supernatural is so
[1:25:06] that you could so that he would be fit
[1:25:09] to introduce the other one.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; It's the other one.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Last of all, he said his son,
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; not a messenger, his son.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Last of all,
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; his son.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; And they said he'll they'll surely
[1:25:30] reverence him.
[1:25:33] But they didn't reverence him.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; And friends, that's the point I'm on. We
[1:25:38] need to reverence him.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Might be in this brother, might be in
[1:25:43] these young fellas, might be in the
[1:25:45] sisters,
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; but reverence him. Amen.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; In the message respects, I'm just way
[1:25:55] ahead of myself now, but in the message
[1:25:58] respects, he spoke a of a number of
[1:26:00] people that didn't respect him.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Then he wanted to speak of some that did
[1:26:04] respect him.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; And he spoke of the Sarapheneician woman
[1:26:09] also spoke of the woman that recognized
[1:26:13] sometimes the sisters within the
[1:26:15] message. Amen. Amen.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; I I want you sisters to know that God is
[1:26:20] calling for women of God
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; in this message.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; You don't have to feel downtrend. You
[1:26:27] can be exactly in your place.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; You can be in a godly place.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; And yet there is a time and she said
[1:26:34] that she perceived and the prophet makes
[1:26:37] makes special note of it. She perceived
[1:26:40] that this was a man of God
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; and she told her husband this is a man
[1:26:44] of God. All right.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; She wasn't teaching him.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; She was telling him what was a reality
[1:26:50] to her.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; This man's a man of God.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; And the man recognized he has a woman of
[1:26:56] God.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; He's got a godly woman.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; And she was due respects. And so uh he
[1:27:02] she he said he's a man of God. Can't we
[1:27:05] and the prophet puts it, can't we get a
[1:27:06] contractor in here and build a little
[1:27:08] place a place where he can rest? to see
[1:27:11] his his hair is hanging down and into
[1:27:13] his beard and so on so forth and tries
[1:27:15] to describe him. Can't we? And the
[1:27:17] husband says, "Yes, he is a man of God.
[1:27:19] I've I've heard of him, etc." And so
[1:27:22] they make a place for him to rest.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "While the prophet's laying
[1:27:26] there with his he's he's laying on the
[1:27:29] cot, laying on the bed that she has
[1:27:31] prepared for him." She worked in her
[1:27:33] ministry.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Brought water and served him and did
[1:27:37] that's what she did for her husband.
[1:27:38] That's what she did. and his feet was
[1:27:40] washed and he was laying there. He said
[1:27:42] he was just laying there so refreshed
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; and his hair washed and his feet washed
[1:27:48] and he's laying there and it just comes
[1:27:50] to him. What can I do? He didn't say,
[1:27:51] "What can I do for the man?
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; What can I do for this woman?"
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. I'm preaching the word
[1:28:00] of God. What can I do for this woman?
[1:28:06] I'm speaking that because brethren
[1:28:08] sometime we need to recognize that God,
[1:28:11] this God I'm speaking about is in this
[1:28:14] woman.
[1:28:16] [Applause]
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; What can I do for this woman? Gahesa
[1:28:26] said she hasn't got a child. Call her.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Not call him. Call her. Yeah.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; And she comes and stands
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; said about this time next year, you'll
[1:28:36] have a child.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What was those words were
[1:28:40] going out creating life?
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; It's the words of God.
[1:28:48] It was the God in her that washed his
[1:28:50] feet. It was the God in her that made a
[1:28:52] bed. It was the God in her that prepared
[1:28:55] a place because she recognized the God
[1:28:57] in him. And then he responded to the God
[1:29:00] in her
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; about this time you'll have life.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, sometimes we take things
[1:29:18] too casual. Yeah,
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; I just recognize that I've seen it in my
[1:29:24] own little ministry and someone will
[1:29:26] come and they will say, you know, what
[1:29:28] do you think about this? And so on and
[1:29:29] we'll have a discussion about it. Then
[1:29:31] the next person comes and says, what do
[1:29:33] you say about this?
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; And I say, well, you know, I I think
[1:29:36] it's probably like this way. And they go
[1:29:39] and take that as God's absolute word.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; And you know what happens? It works for
[1:29:44] them
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; because it's exactly what brother
[1:29:48] Brandham said, I can't help you.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; He said, if you come here now, he's a
[1:29:52] prophet of God. He's a vindicator. He
[1:29:56] sees visions.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; He's the spirit of Elijah. But the
[1:30:00] people if if they don't recognize him
[1:30:02] and the God in him, and he says, "I
[1:30:06] can't help you. I can't do anything for
[1:30:09] you." That's the same God that's in the
[1:30:12] church. That's the same God that's in
[1:30:14] the people.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the same God that's
[1:30:18] in your home.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; In your life.
[1:30:24] And we as individuals have to respect
[1:30:26] the God in our life. You have to respect
[1:30:29] the fact that God called you. Out of
[1:30:32] billions of people, God called you. I'm
[1:30:36] talking about God who created heavens
[1:30:38] and earth. God called you. And God saw
[1:30:42] God called you before you were
[1:30:44] conceived.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; God called you and brought you forth at
[1:30:48] this time to hear this word and to
[1:30:51] believe this message. God called you.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:59] [Applause]
[1:31:02] [Music]
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; I'm so moved.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; I'm so affected. It's been affecting me
[1:31:09] very very deeply.
[1:31:12] in a personal way.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Sometimes even in our daily life, it's,
[1:31:18] you know, we it's fine. We just treat
[1:31:22] people and and speak to them or whether
[1:31:24] it's husband, wife, children, whatever
[1:31:27] more.
[1:31:29] And I remember brother Billy Paul saying
[1:31:31] how his daddy spoke to him about how he
[1:31:35] would correct his child.
[1:31:38] And uh I won't repeat it because I don't
[1:31:41] I don't know the exact details of it
[1:31:44] but I know that you know he talked about
[1:31:48] how we bring up our children and so on
[1:31:52] but how how the body of Jesus Christ I I
[1:31:56] read plenty in the scripture I this goes
[1:31:59] on the internet that's fine but I read
[1:32:00] plenty in the scripture that leaves me a
[1:32:02] sense of conviction.
[1:32:05] It talks about, you know, the honor we
[1:32:08] have for one another in the body of
[1:32:10] Christ and that we are kindly
[1:32:12] affectionate to one another.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; And I'm not one that's really given over
[1:32:17] to the, you know, the kind of
[1:32:19] affectionate kind of stuff, but it says
[1:32:22] we should be kindly affectionate to one
[1:32:23] another, embrace one another, and and so
[1:32:27] on. You know, that's not because it's
[1:32:30] something that we ought to do. It's
[1:32:33] because something we ought to feel.
[1:32:38] We ought to have an honor and a respect.
[1:32:40] And I believe that there is a place that
[1:32:42] we can come to. I really do. And
[1:32:45] especially when we are hearing the
[1:32:47] message in the message respects and I I
[1:32:50] might bounce all over the the
[1:32:54] map today and I hope you don't mind
[1:32:57] but in in the message respects
[1:33:00] brother Brandham reads a scripture out
[1:33:02] of Psalms 105 and it it ends up with or
[1:33:06] part part of the scripture says touch
[1:33:08] not mine anointed
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; ets no harm.
[1:33:14] And the touch is don't reach or extend
[1:33:17] to strike
[1:33:20] or to be stricken to be defeated
[1:33:23] or to be stricken or to do them no harm.
[1:33:27] Don't do them many bad. Don't do any
[1:33:30] evil or to be displeasing
[1:33:33] or injurious.
[1:33:35] Don't injure someone. Don't say
[1:33:38] something that injures them or puts them
[1:33:40] down or suffer or hurt.
[1:33:44] Uh don't shatter them. Don't be that
[1:33:48] they were broken in pieces. You see, and
[1:33:51] I mentioned last week, and I would like
[1:33:54] if you could
[1:33:56] I pray that this would be branded on
[1:33:58] your heart
[1:34:06] where the respect and the honor,
[1:34:10] it doesn't benefit the one that's being
[1:34:13] respected.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; It benefits the one that is doing the
[1:34:18] respecting.
[1:34:20] I took the scripture, honor thy father
[1:34:22] and thy mother that thy days may be long
[1:34:26] on the earth. Another scripture says
[1:34:27] that thy days may be prolonged on the
[1:34:30] earth. It doesn't say anything about the
[1:34:32] mother and father being benefit. Says
[1:34:34] you're benefited.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; As brother Brandham says, if you believe
[1:34:40] me
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; to be God's prophet, I can help you.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; If you don't, I can't
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; I can't do anything for you.
[1:34:49] He says another place and this is really
[1:34:52] takes some thinking. Thinking won't
[1:34:54] really do it. But he says now it depends
[1:34:57] on where what you think this is.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; If you think it's of God, that's where
[1:35:05] your reward will come from.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; If you think it's of the devil, that's
[1:35:10] where your reward will come from.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that person standing
[1:35:14] there on a razor's edge?
[1:35:21] what we think
[1:35:24] of something that's being preached or
[1:35:26] something that's being said.
[1:35:28] I tell you what friends, I just I just
[1:35:30] have such hesitation. But if a person
[1:35:33] has ulterior motives and taking the
[1:35:36] gospel of taking this proven
[1:35:40] vindicated message and has an ulterior
[1:35:42] motive say I will use this for some self
[1:35:46] exaltation. I will use this for to put
[1:35:49] myself forward or I'll you know to prove
[1:35:52] then then that's a dangerous spot to be
[1:35:54] in.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. That's right.
[1:36:07] I would like to just go through some
[1:36:12] various quotes here also in a moment
[1:36:15] and this is I'm I'm going through some
[1:36:18] various stages here and if you if I lose
[1:36:20] you fine uh just if you have a question
[1:36:24] later on I'll be fine I'll be happy to
[1:36:27] have answer any question I can.
[1:36:31] But I I I'm I'm wanting to instruct. I'm
[1:36:34] wanting to teach. I'm wanting to impose
[1:36:38] upon you something that's very heavy on
[1:36:40] my heart. And that is we need to get to
[1:36:43] a place, come to a place, get to a place
[1:36:46] where the supernatural is happening
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; in the inner veil.
[1:36:54] The prophet says, "But if you ever if
[1:36:57] you ever get to a place where you can be
[1:37:00] so hid away in God until the outside
[1:37:04] world is dead
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; and the veil drops over you,
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; folks, there is a place
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; or he wouldn't refer to it." Amen.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; If you could ever get to a place where
[1:37:16] the outside world is you are hid away in
[1:37:19] God and the outside world is dead and
[1:37:22] the veil drops over you. When the veil
[1:37:25] shades you from the outside world, was
[1:37:27] you ever so lost in Christ, so prayed
[1:37:31] through until the world you had no more
[1:37:33] to do with it at all? You walked humbly
[1:37:36] every day before Christ, loving him
[1:37:38] first. And that's what you need. In the
[1:37:41] message, thirsting for life, he talks
[1:37:44] about uh from the scripture, as the
[1:37:46] heart panth after the waterbrook, so
[1:37:49] panth my soul after after thee, oh God.
[1:37:52] He said, when men and women get to a
[1:37:54] place that they've got to have God or
[1:37:57] die,
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; you will get the waterbrook.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; When we get to a place that we've got to
[1:38:06] have God or die.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about come to church.
[1:38:10] I'm not talking about go to the prayer
[1:38:11] meeting. Talking about desiring God.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Tell if I don't have this, I die.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:38:25] said, "If you're sick and need healing,
[1:38:27] if you're in a desperate condition, I
[1:38:29] can say there's a fountain filled with
[1:38:31] blood drawn from Emanuel's veins where
[1:38:34] sinners plunge beneath the flood and
[1:38:36] lose all their guilty stains." He said,
[1:38:38] "It's life everlasting to know him.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Not to know his book, not to know his
[1:38:46] church, not to know his creed, but to
[1:38:50] know him." Amen.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Not to know all the things that of of
[1:38:55] the message and and certain things and
[1:38:58] be able to speak certain jargon and so
[1:39:00] on so forth. I now I go back to and I'm
[1:39:03] going to be referring to it through says
[1:39:05] the message and the messenger is the
[1:39:07] same thing. So well brother Ed you were
[1:39:09] privileged you knew brother Brandham
[1:39:10] that's yes I did and you went with him.
[1:39:13] Yes I did. And that was wonder that must
[1:39:15] have been wonderful. It was wonderful,
[1:39:17] but it was far more wonderful to become
[1:39:20] attached to the words that came out of
[1:39:23] his mouth because those words I received
[1:39:25] as the author of this book.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; And I had to be the author of the book
[1:39:31] because the author made the book live.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Things I never understood became clear.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; I'm saying something to you, friends.
[1:39:45] This church doesn't exist to produce
[1:39:47] some ministry or to produce a
[1:39:49] congregation. This church exists to
[1:39:51] introduce Jesus Christ, the author of
[1:39:54] this book, the one who sent this
[1:39:56] messenger, the one who's revealed, who
[1:39:58] has been revealed. He has revealed
[1:40:01] himself
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; a living person.
[1:40:07] [Music]
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; But to know him, your personal savior
[1:40:15] and lord fills you with the Holy Spirit.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; It puts life in you.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:29] say people say, "Well, I'm in the
[1:40:32] message." What does that mean?
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, they're in the message or they're
[1:40:37] not in the message or they're this one's
[1:40:39] in the me. What does that mean?
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; That phrase is an idle dull phrase.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; What you're really saying is that
[1:40:48] person's in Christ.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; How can a person who's in Christ have
[1:40:54] their mouth filled with venom
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; and poison?
[1:40:59] and injurious things I have to say over
[1:41:02] this pulpit and to the world. It's not
[1:41:04] Christ and that's not the message.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; It's not the message I know. It's not
[1:41:12] the Christ I know.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; And that's a terrible thing
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; to say, "I'm in Christ. I'm in the
[1:41:20] message." If we're in the message, we're
[1:41:21] saying we're in Christ.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; I'm in Jesus Christ.
[1:41:36] friends. When this service is over, I'm
[1:41:38] going to hike along home and you'll
[1:41:40] probably either love me or hate me when
[1:41:42] it's done.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in a bunch of
[1:41:49] phrases.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Phrases we become acquainted and
[1:41:53] accustomed to and we just go over them
[1:41:55] like that. say as soon as I hear in in
[1:41:58] the message I'm thinking of the person
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; because my messenger said you can't
[1:42:03] divide the two they are the same
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; the message and the messenger are one
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; and then some would take it and make the
[1:42:11] messenger something he said he wasn't
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; say well if the message and the
[1:42:17] messenger is Christ and the message is
[1:42:20] Christ and the messenger what is he
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; he's a he's a vessel he was just the
[1:42:25] veil
[1:42:26] to introduce this Christ.
[1:42:30] [Applause]
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; And the world knew, God knew that it' be
[1:42:34] so close and be it confusing. That's why
[1:42:36] you had to say, "Can you get it
[1:42:37] separated now?"
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Did I get that close to
[1:42:44] it?" Don't, whatever you do, sinner,
[1:42:46] backslider, whoever you are, don't get
[1:42:48] that close and miss it.
[1:42:50] [Applause]
[1:42:52] Amen.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking the reality of the message
[1:42:55] now.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:58] [Music]
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand talked about the
[1:43:04] Pentecostal movement at this time is in
[1:43:07] 59
[1:43:09] and he said it was a little small group
[1:43:11] and they became
[1:43:14] thousands of people. they grew.
[1:43:18] And in the message return in Jubilee in
[1:43:20] Shriefport,
[1:43:22] he said, I believe that this is the hour
[1:43:24] of Jubilee again of Jubilee.
[1:43:27] He said, I believe that 50 years ago in
[1:43:29] Louisiana,
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; this great state where the Pentecostal
[1:43:34] people are powerful and strong. And he
[1:43:37] said within 50 years that the church has
[1:43:40] grown from a little handful of people
[1:43:44] of down on Isuza Street until one of the
[1:43:47] mightiest churches marching forward in
[1:43:49] the world today.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; He says we're grateful for that.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; See how kind he is. We're grateful for
[1:43:57] that.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; And and here's a messenger who's got a
[1:44:01] message that's cutting that denomination
[1:44:03] at its very roots.
[1:44:07] But he's thankful for what God did.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And I'm thanking God for
[1:44:13] that."
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; He says, "And I'm also and I am so glad
[1:44:17] to be one of them that God through his
[1:44:20] marvelous grace saw fit one day
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; to bring me into them and make me a part
[1:44:25] of them."
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say, "And it is by no
[1:44:30] means that I say this next thing."
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. through any harm, but through the
[1:44:37] zealousness of zealous, but through
[1:44:40] zealous of the church.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; But that the church yet has grown in
[1:44:44] numbers and it has grown in power. It
[1:44:48] has grown in finance, but it has fallen
[1:44:51] from what it had spiritually.
[1:44:53] [Music]
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Now, that kind of man I can love.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; I'm glad for it. I'm glad for what God
[1:45:02] did. I'm thankful to be associated. I'm
[1:45:05] thankful for be connected. But in 50
[1:45:07] years, you fell from
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; you grown in numbers. You grown in
[1:45:12] finance. You grown in this. You grown in
[1:45:14] the other thing. But you've lost out
[1:45:17] spiritually.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; That's where I don't want to be.
[1:45:21] [Applause]
[1:45:25] There's nothing wrong with the numbers
[1:45:26] and nothing wrong with with growing or
[1:45:29] nothing wrong with God pouring in the
[1:45:31] finance or whatever more to do what you
[1:45:33] need to do. He poured in cattle and
[1:45:36] sheep and camels and gold and silver to
[1:45:38] Abraham cuz he needed it
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; to be the father of the faith.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; He needed it to start off the message
[1:45:46] that God had sent him. We need what we
[1:45:48] have friends.
[1:45:50] If you had my If you had my emails, I
[1:45:53] get I get called from all over the world
[1:45:56] every day. People desiring things. They
[1:46:00] want things. Why? Because we reached out
[1:46:02] to them. They've reached back.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Could you send this? Could you help us
[1:46:06] with that? Could you help us with the
[1:46:08] translation? Whatever. More. Ask Sister
[1:46:11] Sarah or the brother John or those
[1:46:13] brother Kim who work in the office.
[1:46:15] They're just request all the time. And I
[1:46:18] intend to do whatever we can.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Just a little email this morning before
[1:46:24] I come to church. They want to they want
[1:46:26] a hub in Lousoto, South Africa. Well,
[1:46:30] yeah. Or we can say, "Oh, they got
[1:46:32] thousands of believers over there. Let
[1:46:33] them look after it." Well, if they don't
[1:46:36] look after it, I'll get their reward.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; I'll be happy to do it.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah,
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; I'll be happy to have their reward.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; And God sees us, we pour $1,000 out. It
[1:46:51] says, "What do you know? I got to pour
[1:46:53] $1,000 in
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; cuz these folks are going to respond.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; We are going to respond." And we have
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; for 40 years, 35, 40 years, we've
[1:47:03] responded.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; How many got the last report from China,
[1:47:10] brother?
[1:47:12] Yeah, praise the Lord. Handful. You
[1:47:15] ought to read it. It was incredible. The
[1:47:17] book of Acts is being written. I don't
[1:47:18] know what chapter we're in right now.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; He said, and then but the greatest thing
[1:47:27] he said they could have held to would
[1:47:30] have been the Holy Spirit that God by
[1:47:32] his marvelous grace had poured out upon
[1:47:34] them if they would have held to that.
[1:47:37] The bride of Jesus Christ, I'm saying
[1:47:41] indeed has experienced mighty revelation
[1:47:43] of the word.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; But yet, it must be ultra cautious
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; that the zeal and dynamics don't wain
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; or be lost.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; The zeal and dynamics.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; This cannot deteriorate just to a
[1:47:58] church.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; It's got to be a zealous church.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; A church with fire in your bosom. has to
[1:48:05] be a church that loves God
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; and loves God's people and loves God's
[1:48:10] work.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; It must be that way.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the material things
[1:48:16] are. Take that away. But let us have
[1:48:19] that zeal and ferveny of God.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; That when you shake a hand with a
[1:48:24] brother or sister, they know you mean
[1:48:26] it.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Is this all right?
[1:48:34] That's right.
[1:48:37] He went on to say and he was he was
[1:48:40] speaking of in this return uh and
[1:48:43] Jubilee
[1:48:45] he was speaking to one of the old
[1:48:48] fathers that had told him
[1:48:53] and it was sister Mover's father
[1:48:56] and he told him in the early days back
[1:48:58] in the days I'm not trying to reproduce
[1:49:01] that but the same God
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; is the same God that's here.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; And if I don't believe that, I'd go out
[1:49:09] that door and say, "Sal so long, folks."
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; He said, he told me the early days back
[1:49:17] in those days, now this is the messenger
[1:49:20] to revealing the son of man.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; This is part of the revelation.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Saying that I'm God. I change not.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; He doesn't diminish in power.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; He doesn't diminish in desire. The one
[1:49:34] he desired years ago, he desires today.
[1:49:37] The fellowship he desired, he still
[1:49:38] desires that.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Told me that in early days back, he said
[1:49:44] they were persecuted and turned out from
[1:49:47] everywhere.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; That he was in a meeting once to where
[1:49:52] they had forbid them to worship the Lord
[1:49:55] in the spirit.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; We've been put out. I my whole family
[1:49:59] was put out asked to leave a church of
[1:50:02] four 400 450 people. I was teaching
[1:50:06] Sunday school but then they found out
[1:50:08] that I believed in baptism in the name
[1:50:10] of the Lord Jesus Christ and that was
[1:50:13] it. Asked not to come back.
[1:50:17] You know
[1:50:19] the class I had taken the pastor had
[1:50:22] asked me to take it. He was the he would
[1:50:24] been the teacher of the class was young
[1:50:26] married couples.
[1:50:28] It was really the core of that church
[1:50:31] and he took a liking to me and said
[1:50:34] would would you teach this class? So for
[1:50:36] the next while I was teaching that class
[1:50:39] and then we were told to leave.
[1:50:44] told to leave period.
[1:50:48] And uh the next Sunday
[1:50:51] I tried to go to another church and it
[1:50:53] was closed up for camp or something
[1:50:56] and uh we had such an experience as I
[1:51:00] drove up. I was the only only the car
[1:51:02] place was totally vacant. I pulled up
[1:51:04] and right behind the van, the van, the
[1:51:08] van was the dog catcher
[1:51:10] and he had a great big net and he was
[1:51:13] going to catch this dog and the dog was
[1:51:15] on the church steps right at the double
[1:51:17] doors just kind of cowering
[1:51:20] going and I didn't know what it meant to
[1:51:23] my wife and my kids are in the back
[1:51:24] seat. I thought, "Oh my goodness, here
[1:51:26] I'm coming to I'm just going to try
[1:51:28] another church. I just I felt I got to
[1:51:30] go to church and get a crumb or loaf of
[1:51:33] piece of bread or something. And here
[1:51:35] they were out there catching this dog.
[1:51:38] And God had spoken to me and told me to
[1:51:43] go back to the very church we had been
[1:51:45] kicked out of.
[1:51:47] And I went back there.
[1:51:50] Don't believe it was that Sunday. It was
[1:51:52] maybe the Sunday before. I went back and
[1:51:54] I said to my family, "We're going back.
[1:51:58] We're going to walk in that church as
[1:51:59] though nothing happened.
[1:52:02] And we're going to sit where we always
[1:52:03] sit.
[1:52:05] So we did.
[1:52:10] You're nice and quiet.
[1:52:13] The best is yet to come.
[1:52:17] And
[1:52:18] uh when Sunday school came
[1:52:21] uh you know we all filed out to go to
[1:52:24] the Sunday school which last week or the
[1:52:26] week before I was teaching. And now
[1:52:29] because we were the last ones up the
[1:52:31] stairs into this little room. The whole
[1:52:34] the whole room was filled. Sunday school
[1:52:36] room was filled and I had to sit right
[1:52:38] in the front seat right in front of the
[1:52:40] pastor because the pastor took it over
[1:52:42] again.
[1:52:44] and and and I felt so sorry for him
[1:52:47] because he's a he's we became very very
[1:52:49] dear friends. We went to their cabin. We
[1:52:52] spent a lot of time talked about brother
[1:52:53] Bram's meetings in in Windsor and he
[1:52:56] told me astounding things and he was
[1:52:58] really gripped in his heart and he knew
[1:53:00] all about it. It wasn't him that put us
[1:53:02] out understand. So he stood there
[1:53:06] and his lips started to tremble
[1:53:10] literally move
[1:53:12] and he he said uh we'll read the I I'll
[1:53:17] read the text
[1:53:19] for this lesson and his text was and
[1:53:23] they accused him of many things and he
[1:53:26] answered them not a word
[1:53:32] and I was sitting there God bless you,
[1:53:34] brother Ripley.
[1:53:45] And this brother, he was telling brother
[1:53:47] Brandham, he said they were persecuted
[1:53:49] and turned out from everywhere.
[1:53:52] And he was in a meeting once where they
[1:53:54] had forbid them to worship the Lord in
[1:53:57] the in in the spirit. And a group a
[1:54:00] group of people came up and shot through
[1:54:02] the windows with rifles and pistols. And
[1:54:06] an old sister was standing in the floor
[1:54:08] with her hands up in the air praising
[1:54:11] God. And while the windows were being
[1:54:13] riddled with bullets from rifles and the
[1:54:17] bullets struck the woman's dress and
[1:54:19] fell to the floor without harming her.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; She was a she was a greater caliber than
[1:54:27] those guns were.
[1:54:30] She was of a different caliber, wasn't
[1:54:32] she?
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; She's praising God.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; He says, "We need to go back." And this
[1:54:44] is his next line. We need to go back to
[1:54:48] a power of God
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; and something that can do the same thing
[1:54:52] today.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So he wasn't calling on the
[1:54:55] same thing in and exact happening but
[1:55:00] the same thing, the same power, the same
[1:55:02] and and are are we are we in agreement
[1:55:06] with that?
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; I want to see God in reality.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You do as well.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:20] Now,
[1:55:23] as I have been speaking to you,
[1:55:27] the most important and fundamental thing
[1:55:29] that we all can do, I'm going to be a
[1:55:33] little wild, so you're all right.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; The most important and fundamental thing
[1:55:39] that we all can do is to give the Lord
[1:55:43] Jesus Christ. This one I'm speaking of,
[1:55:46] this one is so hard to get separated.
[1:55:49] Give the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[1:55:52] message or the words he has sent to us
[1:55:56] their rightful place
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; of honor and respect in our hearts.
[1:56:02] Amen.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Wherever that God is, if it's in the if
[1:56:06] it's in the pastor, if it's in the
[1:56:08] ministry, if it's in the deacons, if
[1:56:10] it's in the wives, husbands, children,
[1:56:13] wherever that God is, I believe that we
[1:56:16] will be as a congregation
[1:56:20] infinitely blessed
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; if we would make that as our as our
[1:56:25] charge and a commission in our life.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; I'm going to respect that. I'm going to
[1:56:30] honor that. Amen.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Speaking on receiving him, once we know
[1:56:37] who he is,
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; once we recognize him
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; and then we receive that and give it its
[1:56:44] proper place
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; in the Easter Seal, he said, "Notice
[1:56:50] God's life moving through them and in
[1:56:53] them quickened their minds to his word."
[1:56:57] And he said, "Now, let me say that
[1:56:58] quietly." Now, the spirit of God that
[1:57:01] moves among the people quickens the mind
[1:57:04] of the person in the promise of God. He
[1:57:07] said, "And see it doesn't. I'm trying to
[1:57:10] show you and let you realize that I'm
[1:57:12] speaking now of the church." He wasn't
[1:57:14] speaking of himself. He's speaking of
[1:57:16] the church. Speaking of you and I, and I
[1:57:18] want to receive that personally. And it
[1:57:20] also quickened to life in him. Although
[1:57:24] they although they only were his
[1:57:27] attributes to begin with, but if God
[1:57:30] said in this day back in the beginning,
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; John Doe will be my servant. If God said
[1:57:37] that back in the beginning, John Doe
[1:57:39] will be my servant. Millions of years
[1:57:42] ago, now John Doe was born in sin,
[1:57:46] shaped in iniquity, and come into the
[1:57:48] world speaking lies because he was
[1:57:51] immortal or he's immortal. But maybe he
[1:57:54] gets a little religious feeling. He will
[1:57:57] join a church. Maybe he will join a
[1:57:59] Pentecostal church. I don't know. He
[1:58:02] might join anything. But let him get
[1:58:04] under the atmosphere of God once.
[1:58:10] John Doe is bound to recognize
[1:58:13] who his father is.
[1:58:16] [Music]
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; How do you receive him if you haven't
[1:58:20] recognized who your father is? All
[1:58:23] right.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; This message isn't a bunch of books or
[1:58:28] tapes on a shelf.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; This is the person of Jesus Christ.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Say, "Will we believe this? Will we
[1:58:37] believe?" I don't care what you believe.
[1:58:39] If you miss Christ, if you miss the
[1:58:41] person of Christ, it doesn't matter what
[1:58:43] you believe.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; You can be the most precise person, but
[1:58:48] if you don't have the spirit of Christ
[1:58:50] in you, then what have you got? Nothing.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; You could prove on every point we're
[1:58:59] exactly correct on this message if you
[1:59:02] haven't got the spirit of him. We're
[1:59:04] nothing.
[1:59:05] [Music]
[1:59:06] [Applause]
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about every word.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about some words. I'm
[1:59:15] talking about every word.
[1:59:19] The day you read a message, the day you
[1:59:21] read a quote, the person said, "Well,
[1:59:23] yeah." And they're off on somewhere
[1:59:24] else, you can just tuck it down in your
[1:59:27] heart. That person, man, woman, or
[1:59:29] child, is not they're not engaged.
[1:59:32] They're not united in oneness with the
[1:59:34] Christ. I know
[1:59:36] [Applause]
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; he's bound to recognize
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; who his father is.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Now, this is an absolute to me if that
[1:59:52] person, now it's not John Doe, but put
[1:59:55] your name there. When you
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; come under the atmosphere of God once,
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; you're bound to recognize who your
[2:00:05] father is.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; And when you recognize him, then you can
[2:00:08] receive him.
[2:00:17] convinced and this I've written down.
[2:00:19] I'm convinced that the degree of control
[2:00:22] that we allow the message to have in our
[2:00:24] lives is directly connected to who
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; we believe is speaking through the
[2:00:31] prophet
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; and servants of God. Amen.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; The degree that we allow
[2:00:39] the word to have control in our lives
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; is directly connected to what we who we
[2:00:46] believe is speaking. And faith is the
[2:00:48] substance.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; 47 one of the first messages. And may
[2:00:53] everyone that comes tonight, I've
[2:00:55] highlighted all of this. And may
[2:00:57] everyone that comes tonight
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; come like they did when they passed by
[2:01:02] your humble servant.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Simon Peter.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Now he's spanning 2,000 years.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; May everyone who comes tonight
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; in 1947
[2:01:13] come as they did before Peter.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; He's not making any distinction between
[2:01:19] Peter in 1947. And I don't make any
[2:01:22] distinction between 47 and 2011.
[2:01:27] It's God.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord. I change not.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; What he liked back then, he still likes.
[2:01:37] What he loved, he loved. What he hates,
[2:01:39] he still hates.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; He loves righteousness and hates
[2:01:43] iniquity.
[2:01:46] [Music]
[2:01:49] He said, "When they came before your
[2:01:51] humble servant, Simon Peter, and they
[2:01:53] were laid in his shadow and were made
[2:01:56] every wit whole because because they
[2:02:00] recognized God in the man.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; They weren't made whole because it was a
[2:02:08] shadow of Peter. They were made whole
[2:02:10] because they recognized who it was
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; in the man.
[2:02:16] Hallelujah.
[2:02:20] [Music]
[2:02:24] [Applause]
[2:02:28] [Music]
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; You know, I have to be a little bit
[2:02:32] personal, but don't take it as though
[2:02:34] I'm speaking myself. Not at all.
[2:02:37] One day I was here in the office not
[2:02:40] long ago and I thought, "Oh man,
[2:02:44] it's lunchtime. I should have
[2:02:46] something." And my wife says I should
[2:02:47] have something and should go. What do I
[2:02:50] want? I should have maybe a muffin or
[2:02:52] something. You know, just it's noon. I
[2:02:53] should have a muffin or something.
[2:02:56] So I thought, "No, I'll just wait. It's
[2:02:59] getting late." And then no, I'll go. And
[2:03:02] I was in one of those. I'll go. No, I'll
[2:03:04] wait. I'll go. No, I'll wait. And I was
[2:03:06] in such a state of indecision. I went
[2:03:08] and got in my car and I I I I there's a
[2:03:11] wired monks up here and on 64th and it's
[2:03:15] close. So I thought I'll just go up
[2:03:16] there and I thought I'm kind of tired of
[2:03:18] it. Maybe I'll go down to Tim Hortons
[2:03:20] just to down down over the hill. So I
[2:03:23] thought, "Yeah, I'll go to Tim Hortons."
[2:03:24] No. So it was actually telling on my
[2:03:26] steering wheel and uh and I did
[2:03:29] something very foolish. So I thought,
[2:03:31] "No, I'm going to go to Tim Horton." So
[2:03:32] I just going right and wired monk's
[2:03:35] right there in the driveway almost went
[2:03:37] past it and I thought I'm going to go in
[2:03:39] here and I went right across two lanes
[2:03:41] of traffic. That was a crazy thing to
[2:03:43] do. I was just glad, you know. So I got
[2:03:45] in there and and uh
[2:03:49] uh I I just walked in the door and uh
[2:03:52] counter right there and I wanted to find
[2:03:53] out if they still had some soup. So I
[2:03:55] leaned on the counter like this and lady
[2:03:57] says, "Hi, how are you?" I said, "I'm
[2:03:59] fine. Have you got any soup?" And just
[2:04:01] then I felt an arm come around around
[2:04:03] over my shoulder.
[2:04:05] I had round over my shoulder like that.
[2:04:07] And I looked up and it was Sharon.
[2:04:10] Sharon
[2:04:11] couldn't believe Sharon Van enter was
[2:04:13] there. I'd never seen my granddaughter
[2:04:15] in that place ever.
[2:04:17] What are you doing here? Well, she said
[2:04:20] I I and I could see her her face and
[2:04:25] eyes were kind of shallow and deep sunk.
[2:04:28] And she says, "Well, I had to work
[2:04:30] today." And there there she's carrying
[2:04:32] these three babies.
[2:04:34] Said, "You had to work today?"
[2:04:37] Yeah. She said, "I I went to work at
[2:04:39] 6:00."
[2:04:42] And I said, "You don't have any business
[2:04:44] working. Do you want these babies or do
[2:04:47] you want to work?"
[2:04:49] And she said, "Well, yeah, I know. You
[2:04:51] know, I'm feeling good, Grandpa." And so
[2:04:53] on so forth. So, we sat and had our our
[2:04:56] lunch together.
[2:04:58] And I preached to her. I really felt on
[2:05:00] my heart, you should be home just having
[2:05:02] your feet up and you should be home just
[2:05:05] resting.
[2:05:07] And I was so impressed with that. And
[2:05:09] she's she's strong and feeling good. And
[2:05:11] she hadn't been sick an hour in her in
[2:05:13] all of all of her time carrying these
[2:05:15] children. Not sick for one hour. She is
[2:05:17] feeling real good. And but there was it
[2:05:20] was a bit of a hard day. And I got back
[2:05:23] to the office and I picked up the phone
[2:05:25] and I called her husband.
[2:05:30] He was at work. I said, "Brother Marco,
[2:05:32] I just I was just in Wired Monk and
[2:05:35] Sharon was there and we sat down. I
[2:05:38] said, "She should not be working.
[2:05:42] She really shouldn't be working."
[2:05:45] And I said, "It it's, you know, it it
[2:05:46] tells on her. Maybe she doesn't realize
[2:05:48] it, but it it uh I can see it in her
[2:05:50] face.
[2:05:52] What does he do? He picks up the phone,
[2:05:55] calls her immediately.
[2:05:57] Cuz he wasn't receiving that from
[2:05:59] grandpa.
[2:06:01] He receiving that as a man of God.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what he was acting on. He
[2:06:06] picked up the phone immediately and
[2:06:08] said, "Quit work."
[2:06:12] And she quit work that day.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; And you know what? and all this last,
[2:06:18] you know, all his last weeks and
[2:06:19] everything, everything just going along
[2:06:21] perfect. I'm not saying it's because of
[2:06:23] that, but I'm saying God's pleased with
[2:06:25] that.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; God's pleased with that.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; And then a lot of times, you know,
[2:06:30] people get into all kinds of snags and
[2:06:32] trouble and everything else. And and I
[2:06:35] know that if they would have listened,
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; they wouldn't be in that problem.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; And it depends on you. I say, "Well, are
[2:06:46] you saying that God was speaking through
[2:06:48] you?" I don't know. But he took it as
[2:06:50] that.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; Do you catch what I'm saying? He took it
[2:06:55] as that.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; And then God realizes I got to move.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; He has believed in his heart. He's heard
[2:07:03] from me.
[2:07:06] [Music]
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, if that I I don't take
[2:07:09] that as God." What if it was?
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:15] Amen.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Maybe mother, father, you can bring
[2:07:19] right down to your home. You young
[2:07:20] people, you hear, "Well, dad says this.
[2:07:22] Well, dad thinks that and mom thinks
[2:07:25] this." Maybe it's not God thinks that or
[2:07:27] or dad thinks that or mom thinks that.
[2:07:29] Maybe it's God that thinks that.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; It'll surely be in accordance with the
[2:07:33] word of God.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Have you got a few more minutes for me?
[2:07:38] Amen.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; One of the greatest blessings
[2:07:46] is a razor's edge from the greatest
[2:07:49] curse.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. One of
[2:07:53] the greatest blessings is a razor's edge
[2:07:57] from the greatest curse.
[2:08:01] Jesus said, I want you to just catch
[2:08:04] this now and catch this phrase, me and
[2:08:06] my words.
[2:08:08] Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of
[2:08:10] me and my words, in this adulterous and
[2:08:13] sinful generation, of him also shall the
[2:08:16] son of man be ashamed when he cometh in
[2:08:18] glory of his father with the holy
[2:08:20] angels,
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; me and my words. In John 12:48, he that
[2:08:25] rejectth me and receive He that
[2:08:28] rejecteth me and receiveth not my words.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Hath one that judgeth him the word that
[2:08:35] I have spoken shall judge him in that
[2:08:36] last day. John 14 and 23 23 John Jesus
[2:08:41] answered and said unto them, if a man
[2:08:43] love me, he will keep my words.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; It was he he in his words, me and my
[2:08:49] words. If you do not believe that I am
[2:08:52] he,
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; who is I?
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; And who is he?
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; The same one.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; You may think I'm I'm I I'm from the
[2:09:02] carpenter shop. I am.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; So what's the difference?
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Whether I'm from the carpenter shop.
[2:09:08] Say, well, he he just works at, you
[2:09:10] know, he's a mechanic or he's this or
[2:09:11] he's other. He's But if he's a son of
[2:09:14] God, he has God in him.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; If she's a daughter of God, have God in
[2:09:18] him.
[2:09:20] [Music]
[2:09:21] [Applause]
[2:09:28] He says, "And he will keep my words and
[2:09:31] conjunction."
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; My father will love him
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; and we will come unto him.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; Isn't this incredible?
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; All you've done is kept his words.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Who's the beneficiary? Is God made
[2:09:49] greater? No. You're the beneficiary.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; You just keep his words.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; And if and if you believe this message,
[2:09:59] that's why you're here. If the message
[2:10:01] and the messenger are one
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; and the messenger said this is Christ
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; and you have received Christ and you are
[2:10:10] honoring him and you're giving him all
[2:10:12] the adoration, listen to me. And in that
[2:10:15] simple act, that's why I said this is a
[2:10:18] critical message. In that simple act, if
[2:10:21] you believe what Jesus said, if you
[2:10:23] honor my words, if you keep my words, my
[2:10:26] father will love you.
[2:10:30] [Music]
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I don't care who rejects you
[2:10:34] or who turns you out or who cast you
[2:10:36] out. But if I have my father who loves
[2:10:39] me
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; and we will come to him
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; in the good times and in the bad times.
[2:10:50] We will come to him.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, I could do a
[2:10:56] dance.
[2:10:58] I feel so energized.
[2:11:01] This is I'm taking this word by word
[2:11:03] truth as the truth of God
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; and we will come to him
[2:11:11] [Music]
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; and make our abode with him.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; We're not going to come and visit him.
[2:11:17] We're going to come and make our abode.
[2:11:19] Do you believe these words?
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; That's the words of Jesus Christ.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Let me go quickly. I'm going to go
[2:11:30] quickly as I can. Please don't weary on
[2:11:31] me, will you?
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; I've made a note. Notice if the message
[2:11:39] and the messenger are one,
[2:11:42] then we have the essence of both
[2:11:44] present.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; You got it.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; That can help us. Glory. Hallelujah.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; We got connected. Just about couldn't
[2:12:06] get disconnected.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Then we have the essence of both
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; present with us.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; I haven't got a bunch of books and just
[2:12:19] a bunch of tapes. We got the very
[2:12:21] messenger and his message with us.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; The message is Christ.
[2:12:29] Hallelujah.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; You might think I'm crazy, but you say,
[2:12:36] "Oh, brother Ed, you were with Brother
[2:12:38] Brandham." So were you.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; This is This is his whole life poured
[2:12:43] out.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; This is his whole being poured out.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; This is what he lived for.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; This is his life.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:58] Hallelujah.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; In the spiritual food, he says, "We find
[2:13:03] out that when a man comes sent from God,
[2:13:07] ordained of God with the truth, thus
[2:13:10] saith the Lord, the message and the
[2:13:12] messenger are one and the same."
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Because he is sent to represent thus
[2:13:20] sayaith the Lord,
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; word by word. And he and his message is
[2:13:26] the same.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; It doesn't make him Christ, but it makes
[2:13:32] him inseparable from the message.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; And it makes Christ the message.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; He's inseparable from the message.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; If you can get it, friends,
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; I don't ever to I won't approach this
[2:13:51] again. He says, "Now we find out that
[2:13:53] Elijah could say that because the
[2:13:56] message of the hour and the word of God
[2:13:58] or the messenger, the message, the
[2:14:02] message and the word of God was exactly
[2:14:04] the same thing.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; The prophet, the word, the message,
[2:14:09] messenger, message and the man was the
[2:14:12] same thing."
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Messenger message and the man were the
[2:14:16] same thing. Amen.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If I do not the works," now
[2:14:20] he goes to the scripture. "If I do not
[2:14:22] the works uh that was written of me,
[2:14:25] then don't believe me."
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; If we don't do, and I'll bring it right
[2:14:31] down home. If we don't do the works of
[2:14:32] the bride of Jesus Christ, we're
[2:14:34] married. If we act like we're, you know,
[2:14:37] just free to do anything or be united
[2:14:40] with something else and people start
[2:14:41] looking over the fence in the message,
[2:14:43] you start looking over the fence back to
[2:14:45] some denomination or some creed or back
[2:14:49] to Pentecost.
[2:14:51] That's not the that's not being
[2:14:53] honorable to your husband.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; That's like looking over the fence and
[2:14:58] seeing the neighbor.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:15:05] We're not interested in their programs.
[2:15:07] I'm not interested in their talent. I'm
[2:15:09] not interested in their worship. I'm not
[2:15:11] interested in her doctrine. I'm not
[2:15:13] interested in it.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; We're married to one husband
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; called Jesus Christ,
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; and we haven't got eyes for anybody
[2:15:26] else.
[2:15:27] [Music]
[2:15:31] You may dislike that, but I know many of
[2:15:33] you do like it.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; That's the truth of God's word.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; And when the believers of this message
[2:15:40] have become completely united with the
[2:15:43] message who is Christ,
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; then they're not looking for another
[2:15:47] message.
[2:15:48] [Applause]
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; There's not another Christ. This is him.
[2:15:55] [Applause]
[2:16:00] I haven't run out of things to say. I'm
[2:16:02] just thinking about whether I should say
[2:16:03] it.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:08] [Applause]
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; If we give the message high regard and
[2:16:18] respect it with godly fear and
[2:16:20] reverence, we are respecting the
[2:16:22] messenger.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; The message. Yeah.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; And the word.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Don't worry friends, you can't give it
[2:16:32] too much honor.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; That's what God has spoke
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; through his messenger vindicated. And
[2:16:38] this is the word and I believe it. And
[2:16:41] then all of you become one.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:16:49] [Applause]
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. teach your children to do the
[2:16:54] same.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm fully aware we hear, you know,
[2:17:01] the other ministers, Brother John,
[2:17:04] Brother Tom, and
[2:17:07] Brother Andes and different ones. And
[2:17:09] often we hear about the families, but
[2:17:11] we're we're all a family. And I I
[2:17:14] recognize that some of you don't have
[2:17:16] children here. Maybe you haven't even
[2:17:17] got home or wife or husband or whatever
[2:17:20] more. And you may not have children
[2:17:21] here. But don't don't don't
[2:17:25] feel for a moment that there isn't a
[2:17:27] sense of responsibility. Not so much a
[2:17:30] responsibility, but it's an opportunity
[2:17:32] for you to be an example to even to
[2:17:34] others
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; and say a wise word to them
[2:17:40] and improving his word.
[2:17:42] I want to talk now just for a few
[2:17:44] moments about the approach. I got two
[2:17:46] things more I want to say. I want to say
[2:17:48] about the approach. The mechanics and
[2:17:51] the dynamics are present.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; But yet it requires the right attitude
[2:17:56] and approach.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; The mechanics and the dynamics are both
[2:18:03] here
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; because the message is here.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; The word is here.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is here.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; There's more dynamics than you can even
[2:18:12] lay hold of.
[2:18:15] [Applause]
[2:18:18] Amen.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; See, I'm going to I'm going to say
[2:18:21] something, friends. There's things that
[2:18:23] happen on a regular basis, and some of
[2:18:25] the greatest things that take place,
[2:18:28] we're not even able to really speak
[2:18:30] about because what you see here is just
[2:18:32] the tip of the iceberg.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; And so much is happening. I'm talking
[2:18:37] about lives that are changed,
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; lives that are shaped
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; by the word of God and catastrophes
[2:18:45] which are avoided
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; and terrible injurious things which are
[2:18:50] avoided and and homes and lives of young
[2:18:55] and older alike are are made so uh
[2:19:00] protected.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[2:19:04] in proving his word. He says, "But
[2:19:06] before we pray for the sick,
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; now we've got to get the people in the
[2:19:12] that attitude."
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; It's the attitude that always always Do
[2:19:18] you say amen to always always brings the
[2:19:22] results?
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; It's not the preacher that brings the
[2:19:26] results. It's the attitude that brings
[2:19:29] the results. Yes.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; Once again, your approach,
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; you're the beneficiary.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; Even when you come forward for prayer,
[2:19:41] it should be different. I would urge you
[2:19:43] to come differently. I don't care who's
[2:19:45] who's ministered, who's handled the word
[2:19:47] of God saying, "I am coming. I don't
[2:19:50] care whether there be some deacons, but
[2:19:51] but your attitude saying I am coming to
[2:19:55] the God in these people. I'm coming to
[2:19:58] the God in this servant of God.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; You can pray for one another. Husband,
[2:20:06] wife, you can pray for one another.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you friends, I'm not
[2:20:20] preaching here for my health. I'm
[2:20:22] preaching here to tell you that I
[2:20:24] believe with all my heart that we have
[2:20:27] we have much much more
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; than we access
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; and we have it here.
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; And I'm urging you, you know, write the
[2:20:37] check.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said that so many
[2:20:41] people, they got the bank account full,
[2:20:44] but they don't know how to write a
[2:20:45] check.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; All things are possible.
[2:20:51] Sometimes I believe
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:58] [Music]
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; It's the attitude
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; that you take towards God.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Here's a woman touched his
[2:21:12] garment."
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; And then he said, "But here's here's a
[2:21:15] soldier that took a hold of him and
[2:21:17] touched him and struck him. He didn't
[2:21:20] get any virtue and she got it all.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; What was the difference? The difference
[2:21:26] wasn't with him. He had all the power.
[2:21:29] He could have forgiven the soldiers
[2:21:31] sins.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; But he was condemned because his
[2:21:36] attitude was wrong and her attitude was
[2:21:40] right.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; It's your he said it's your approach to
[2:21:45] the divine gift
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; that brings the results. You may say,
[2:21:48] "Well, Brother Biscll, you spoke this
[2:21:50] and you said some of these same quotes.
[2:21:52] I don't know whether I did or not. I
[2:21:54] tried to get away from it, but I
[2:21:55] couldn't get away from this because I
[2:21:57] want to see a church that gains and has
[2:22:00] results.
[2:22:03] I want to see things change in your
[2:22:06] lives, in your homes,
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; in every area.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; And it's not some pie in the sky. It's
[2:22:13] right here.
[2:22:16] [Music]
[2:22:19] It's present with you.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; The word of faith is near you, even in
[2:22:23] your mouth.
[2:22:25] [Music]
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; And he says, it's your approach to a
[2:22:32] divine gift what brings the results.
[2:22:36] It's the way you come to it.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:49] said, "If you believe,
[2:22:52] then I can help you."
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; In the scripture,
[2:23:00] he that receiveth you receiveth me,
[2:23:03] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[2:23:06] that sent me. Amen.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; It's been a text from our last services.
[2:23:14] I maybe just drop this in
[2:23:17] as humans.
[2:23:22] We are
[2:23:25] so to say moving targets.
[2:23:29] We're healthy and strong today.
[2:23:32] We become weakened
[2:23:34] perhaps few years down the road. say,
[2:23:37] "Well, I you know
[2:23:40] my dad or the pastor or someone else's
[2:23:43] frail old man anymore."
[2:23:47] Or they saw Jesus, that young prophet
[2:23:50] out of Nazareth standing there and
[2:23:53] declaring the word and giving the
[2:23:55] message on the mountain and they
[2:23:57] wondered at the gracious lips, the
[2:24:00] gracious words that came from his lips.
[2:24:04] And then on down
[2:24:06] he he aids so quickly. A moving target
[2:24:11] and he gets to be
[2:24:14] stooped over with his shoulders. He's
[2:24:16] carrying your sins and mine.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; And he looks wearied.
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; And he looks 50
[2:24:25] and he's only 30.
[2:24:29] And I thought I could have heard him.
[2:24:31] Oh, I I so rejoiced back there. But now
[2:24:34] he's saying strange things. I I don't
[2:24:36] know what's happened. Talking about
[2:24:37] eating his flesh and drinking his blood.
[2:24:40] And my goodness, who can who can even
[2:24:43] understand that? I don't understand. I
[2:24:45] don't understand what happened to him. I
[2:24:47] was ready to accept his doctrine. I was
[2:24:50] ready to join his movement back then.
[2:24:53] Everything's changed so much.
[2:24:57] You know, that's why brother Brent talks
[2:24:59] about the
[2:25:01] marriage and
[2:25:03] between husband and wife,
[2:25:06] she's always your sweetheart.
[2:25:10] You're always his sweetheart.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; You understand that?
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will never leave you nor
[2:25:19] forsake you."
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; I don't care if you're in the vigor of
[2:25:22] your youth and the beauty of your youth
[2:25:24] or whether you're old and decrepit. I
[2:25:26] will never leave you.
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; Hang on just for a few minutes, please.
[2:25:36] David.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; So, here come this man,
[2:25:43] a Elisha
[2:25:47] and he's walking down and the little
[2:25:50] kids, the children. I know that you
[2:25:54] children never would do that. You're
[2:25:55] taught different, but they're running
[2:25:57] down cuz they heard it at home.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; They heard it as a baldhead. Why didn't
[2:26:04] he go up? You you followed Elijah.
[2:26:06] Elijah went up. Why didn't you go up?
[2:26:09] And so they're running along. Oh, you
[2:26:11] baldhead. Why don't you go up? Why
[2:26:13] didn't you go up?
[2:26:17] And the scripture tells us, the Bible
[2:26:19] tells us they turned around, cursed
[2:26:21] them.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; And 42 of them at she bears came out and
[2:26:26] killed 42 children. You say, "Oh,
[2:26:31] that's so awful."
[2:26:33] Brother Brandham says, "Now this is why
[2:26:35] you need a messenger." Brother Brandham
[2:26:37] says,
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; That he was cursing their parents
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; for having said what they said.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; And now they ended up with some
[2:26:47] funerals.
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; See, we just see things on the surface.
[2:26:53] Then how can God do that? Well, listen
[2:26:56] friends, God, you know what your prophet
[2:26:59] said? He said that the world and the
[2:27:02] unbelievers and the haters of the haters
[2:27:05] of purity and holiness says it's atomic
[2:27:09] fodder.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; Now you may not understand that. You
[2:27:13] don't have to understand that God is
[2:27:15] going to hold this world accountable
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; for having hated righteousness.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; Anyway, better get off that.
[2:27:27] Amen.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm closing just a few minutes
[2:27:32] now.
[2:27:35] It's almost 1:00 and I'm I'm not going
[2:27:37] to apologize, but I just say I'll just
[2:27:39] be a few minutes. You've been very kind.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; And show us the father and it'll
[2:27:45] satisfy.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; He said, he's speaking to a lady. He
[2:27:50] said, uh, I'm taking this as a
[2:27:52] principle. Not back there. Don't take
[2:27:55] the quote back there. You have the
[2:27:56] message and you have the messenger. You
[2:27:58] have the whole essence of this.
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; You have what the messenger lived for.
[2:28:03] You have it here.
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; You don't have to say, "Well, that was
[2:28:06] back there." No, it's right here.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; I want you to get that fixed in your
[2:28:10] mind. It's not way back there. Say,
[2:28:11] "Well, that was 56. No, that No, it's
[2:28:13] right here. It's 2011."
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; What about you, lady? Could be any lady
[2:28:21] here.
[2:28:24] Oh, you believe
[2:28:25] you believe that I'm your brother?
[2:28:27] Number one,
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; but do you believe that I become
[2:28:34] your brother plus
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; God's prophet?
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; It's the plus factor.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; You believe me to be your brother,
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; but you believe me to be your brother
[2:28:47] plus
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; God's prophet.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; And this was critical.
[2:28:53] This was absolutely critical because he
[2:28:56] says you believe that
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; then I can help you.
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; listen. This comes down to all of us.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; We need to get the plus factor.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; You're my brother in Christ plus
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; a bloodbought
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; bride member
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; of the body of Jesus Christ. You're part
[2:29:21] of his body. You're part of the one who
[2:29:23] I say I love.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; We need the plus factor.
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; The man who stands behind this pulpit,
[2:29:35] I'm not speaking of myself. Whoever
[2:29:37] stands behind this pulpit is God's
[2:29:39] servant. He's your brother. us
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; for the gifts and calling of God are
[2:29:47] without repentance
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; and we can't apologize over that.
[2:29:53] [Applause]
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon wasn't getting anything
[2:29:57] by saying plus his prophet.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; He said I wanted to be a trapper.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; I wanted to be in the wilderness.
[2:30:07] Listen, I happen to know. Don't ever ask
[2:30:12] me to answer this question because I
[2:30:13] won't tell you. But I happen to know the
[2:30:15] very place when brother Brandon was
[2:30:18] preaching Bruce Serpent and was so sick
[2:30:21] at his heart over some of the things
[2:30:23] that were happening.
[2:30:25] He wanted to come up and buy a place. I
[2:30:30] know the exact place. He talked about it
[2:30:34] on the Alaskan highway and told me how
[2:30:36] much money he had.
[2:30:39] And he said, "I just come up here and
[2:30:40] help Bud."
[2:30:43] As he was ready to give it up
[2:30:46] because they were going to start a Bible
[2:30:47] school teaching him was Jesus Christ.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; And I you know what I said? I said,
[2:30:58] "Well, brother Brandham," I said, 'You
[2:31:00] know, if you want to just be up here in
[2:31:01] the wilderness, you can you can catch a
[2:31:06] a jet out of Fort Nelson and fly
[2:31:09] anywhere in the world.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; That was right at that time.
[2:31:25] If they felt they were giving him honor,
[2:31:27] it wasn't honor
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; because it's not in the word.
[2:31:40] He said in one of his last messages that
[2:31:43] he spoke on earth, it was easy for those
[2:31:47] Jews
[2:31:48] who'd been taught through generations to
[2:31:51] believe that there was a great
[2:31:52] supernatural God, but to think that that
[2:31:56] God had come down.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; To think that that God who they believed
[2:32:01] and they understood that that God had
[2:32:03] come down and was manifesting himself
[2:32:06] through the person of his son Jesus
[2:32:09] Christ. And that's why I said if you
[2:32:11] don't believe that I am he, you'll die
[2:32:14] in your unbelief.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus wouldn't change. He wouldn't
[2:32:18] diminish.
[2:32:20] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't make him a non-savior or a
[2:32:22] non-healer. He'd still be a healer. He'd
[2:32:24] still have He'd still have everything he
[2:32:26] did have. It was them that were going to
[2:32:28] lose it.
[2:32:30] And I say to this congregation and all
[2:32:32] that are streaming and all that will
[2:32:34] ever hear this, whatever you do,
[2:32:35] remember that this message is none other
[2:32:38] than Jesus Christ.
[2:32:41] [Music]
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; The message and the messenger are one.
[2:32:47] [Music]
[2:32:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; While he is not that person, he said
[2:32:54] clearly I am not him
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; but I have been sent to reveal him. And
[2:33:00] he's the one who said, "And I have sent
[2:33:02] you to reveal me."
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; You're the one that's been chosen. Of
[2:33:07] six billion people, I've chosen one.
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; I spoke poor in my language. You speak
[2:33:14] poor in your language. I came out of
[2:33:16] poverty. You came out of poverty.
[2:33:19] &gt;&gt; Our backgrounds are similar because he
[2:33:22] had to represent this one.
[2:33:25] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:33:27] Amen.
[2:33:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; And here I said a while ago that this
[2:33:35] was the critical spot. And here it is.
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; In Mark 14, it says, "But he held his
[2:33:42] peace and answered nothing." Again, the
[2:33:45] high priest asked him and said unto him,
[2:33:47] "Art thou the Christ, the son of the
[2:33:49] beloved?"
[2:33:52] Here he's been telling them, "If you
[2:33:54] don't believe that I'm he, you're going
[2:33:56] to die in your sin.
[2:33:58] Now they've moved him right up to the
[2:33:59] judgment.
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; Art thou the Christ, the son of the
[2:34:03] beloved. And Jesus said, "I am."
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; And you shall see the son of man sitting
[2:34:09] in the right hand of power and coming
[2:34:11] with claw the clouds of heaven. And then
[2:34:14] the high priest, he rent his clothes and
[2:34:16] said, "What need have we of further
[2:34:18] witness? You have heard the blasphemy.
[2:34:21] What think ye?" And they all condemned
[2:34:23] him to be guilty of death.
[2:34:27] on that point.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; Please get that on that point. That's my
[2:34:33] whole message this morning. That's my
[2:34:35] whole service. I'm saying this is he.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; And if you can accept that, you're in
[2:34:42] for blessings.
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; This is he.
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:54] I feel electrified by this friends.
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; I'm saying it to you young people. I'm
[2:35:00] saying it to you girls, you boys. You
[2:35:02] may never hear it again. That this is
[2:35:04] he. And if you'll take a hold of this
[2:35:06] word and say, I'm going to give that due
[2:35:08] respect.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; I'm going to respect that. I'm going to
[2:35:12] follow it like I'm following Jesus
[2:35:14] Christ of Nazareth as he walked. I will
[2:35:18] uh I will do whatever I can to further
[2:35:20] his cause. Let your kingdom come, God. I
[2:35:24] am your servant, Lord Jesus. I'm here to
[2:35:26] serve you. I'm here to live. I'm here to
[2:35:28] express you and let people see you. Let
[2:35:31] people hear from you.
[2:35:33] [Music]
[2:35:34] [Applause]
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; Closing.
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; And when he got to that point,
[2:35:42] I am he.
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; Need we have further
[2:35:47] hear this blasphemy to a lot of people.
[2:35:50] That's where the message got to. That's
[2:35:52] why he said this is so hard to get
[2:35:54] separated.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; That's the point.
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; We wear different hats.
[2:36:08] We feel different. All I can tell you
[2:36:11] friends, all I can tell you children,
[2:36:15] young people, if you haven't had the
[2:36:17] experience,
[2:36:19] you should perhaps start watching for
[2:36:20] it.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; There'll be a time when maybe things are
[2:36:24] kind of going sideways in your life and
[2:36:26] saying, you know what,
[2:36:29] I'm going to go to my father, but I'm
[2:36:31] not just going to his dad.
[2:36:36] I have a daughter sitting right here
[2:36:38] whose son was very weward. I shouldn't
[2:36:41] say very weward but he was weward
[2:36:46] and we were having a special speaker
[2:36:48] here in the church
[2:36:50] and she said I want him at my place.
[2:36:55] I remember the woman
[2:36:58] and the Bible had prepared a place for
[2:37:00] the man of God
[2:37:02] and I will receive this minister as the
[2:37:04] man of God
[2:37:06] because I have in my heart
[2:37:09] my son.
[2:37:11] It doesn't matter where you are. We
[2:37:14] walked out of Starbucks.
[2:37:18] It was at the same time we walked out of
[2:37:19] Starbucks. We'd been in there. We talked
[2:37:21] as a family.
[2:37:23] As we walked out, my wife walked towards
[2:37:25] your car and said, "And Joanne came
[2:37:28] right up up to me. I was standing, she
[2:37:30] was standing on the curb, and I tell you
[2:37:33] what,
[2:37:35] I don't know if I ever saw her look on
[2:37:37] her face."
[2:37:39] She says, "The woman who received a son
[2:37:43] from God, I am that woman
[2:37:47] and I am coming to the man of God."
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:52] And she says, "And that woman's son
[2:37:54] died,
[2:37:56] and God gave me this son, and he has
[2:38:00] died,
[2:38:01] and I'm coming you to you now that he
[2:38:04] shall come to life."
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; And God gave her that son
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; the second time. That's not that's not
[2:38:12] just a personal testimony. I'm just
[2:38:13] telling you that that happened to be a
[2:38:15] reality.
[2:38:17] And if you don't believe it, just go and
[2:38:18] talk to her and ask her how happy she is
[2:38:20] or her husband how happy she is. It
[2:38:23] didn't make me any greater.
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; I felt very humbled.
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:38:29] &gt;&gt; In fact is I didn't know hardly how to
[2:38:32] respond
[2:38:34] &gt;&gt; and I felt a sense of responsibility
[2:38:37] that I really didn't want.
[2:38:40] This gets too critical
[2:38:44] because immediately I thought this boy
[2:38:48] I'm I'm being put into a spot
[2:38:51] where she's coming and declaring her
[2:38:54] faith.
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; This son must be brought back to life
[2:38:57] again.
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; The chains of sin must be broken.
[2:39:03] &gt;&gt; I just want to say to you friends,
[2:39:05] family of God didn't make me anything
[2:39:08] greater. It gave her the benefit.
[2:39:12] [Music]
[2:39:13] &gt;&gt; Gave their family the benefit.
[2:39:15] &gt;&gt; After the prophet, will you get what he
[2:39:17] said? It doesn't make do anything for
[2:39:19] him. You're the one that benefits.
[2:39:22] [Applause]
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to close with something so
[2:39:30] very simple. And don't let the message
[2:39:33] lose its strength or value.
[2:39:36] Some of these things you maybe think
[2:39:38] that I'm oversimplistic or what whatever
[2:39:40] whatever you think. But anyway, I'm
[2:39:42] ending.
[2:39:45] I've noticed something in this church
[2:39:46] that has troubled me and that is when
[2:39:48] the minister gets done. There's like a
[2:39:51] mass exodus
[2:39:53] out of the church
[2:39:55] and people somehow feel free and it's
[2:39:57] it's right at the and the scripture if
[2:39:59] you understood the scripture. The
[2:40:01] scripture says, "And he confirmed the
[2:40:03] word
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; with signs following."
[2:40:08] &gt;&gt; It's not a time for mass exodus.
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; And here you read it yourself. Go to
[2:40:14] your own message and search it yourself.
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:40:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, and he had to say
[2:40:19] in this, I'm embarrassed that he had to
[2:40:21] tell us how to dress,
[2:40:24] how to act,
[2:40:26] how to be. I'm embarrassed. We ought to
[2:40:27] know those things because they were
[2:40:29] ABCs.
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; And now he comes to the he comes. Now
[2:40:33] listen closely. I'm just closing.
[2:40:36] He knows that in the next few moments,
[2:40:40] &gt;&gt; the angel of the Lord that is right
[2:40:43] here,
[2:40:44] &gt;&gt; is going to come and start speaking
[2:40:46] through him
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; to individuals. And he's going to maybe
[2:40:50] even be into another realm, into another
[2:40:52] world. and and and he realizes that this
[2:40:56] is such a crit, you know what he says to
[2:40:57] the people? Don't move.
[2:41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; Don't move around. You think, oh, we're
[2:41:06] looking for some spectacular thing out
[2:41:09] of the heavens and he's telling people,
[2:41:10] don't move.
[2:41:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:13] &gt;&gt; He says you have a spirit.
[2:41:16] &gt;&gt; And it it interferes
[2:41:19] &gt;&gt; with what's happening. So don't move at
[2:41:22] that time. Amen.
[2:41:23] &gt;&gt; And you know what? And he says, "Be
[2:41:25] reverent."
[2:41:27] &gt;&gt; So does right at that moment. It's not a
[2:41:28] moment. And then they say, "Well, you
[2:41:30] know, to get up and I got to go to the
[2:41:34] washroom or go." Do you really need to?
[2:41:36] Is it a matter of life or death?
[2:41:40] Are we really able to hold out for
[2:41:43] another few minutes?
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; So, well, my baby's squirming. Well, get
[2:41:47] something so it doesn't squirm
[2:41:50] if you possibly can. entertain it a
[2:41:53] little bit more. If you can't and it's
[2:41:54] fussing, well, absolutely step out. But
[2:41:58] right at the time when a minister is
[2:42:00] done, what I'm calling on you all to say
[2:42:03] is I recognize God in this message.
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; And now this is the time I give my utter
[2:42:10] undivided reverence
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; from the youngest to the eldest who say,
[2:42:15] "God, what is it that you want to do
[2:42:17] just now?
[2:42:19] Whatever it is you want to do, I'm
[2:42:21] blending. I'm giving my effort. I'm
[2:42:23] giving my I give myself freely and
[2:42:26] completely. Oh God, now come in your
[2:42:31] divine will and perfect will and
[2:42:33] accomplish it in the name of Jesus
[2:42:36] Christ.
[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:45] &gt;&gt; I'm done.
[2:42:48] We'll bow our heads in prayer, please.
[2:42:54] Father,
[2:42:57] please accept our
[2:43:00] thanksgiving this morning.
[2:43:03] I want to take time to give you praise,
[2:43:08] give you glory and thanksgiving.
[2:43:11] Where would I be? Where would we be had
[2:43:14] you not sent this message and this
[2:43:16] messenger? and he was so faithful to it.
[2:43:19] Thank you for that faithfulness.
[2:43:21] Thank you for that uncompromising
[2:43:23] Holy Spirit that so motivated him and
[2:43:27] moved him into the realms of the
[2:43:30] supernatural. And you spoke things, oh
[2:43:32] God, that were so godly. You spoke
[2:43:35] things that were so eternal and such a
[2:43:38] such a uh such a height and a a level of
[2:43:41] blessing. Father, thank you. I pray that
[2:43:44] you receive our thanksgiving. receive,
[2:43:47] oh God, the reverence of the people, the
[2:43:50] acknowledgment that they have had and
[2:43:52] how they've helped your your poor
[2:43:54] servant this morning to utter the things
[2:43:57] that have been on my heart, oh God. And
[2:43:59] I pray, Lord, that you'll move them.
[2:44:01] This is not to be just another service.
[2:44:03] This is not just another Sunday morning,
[2:44:05] but this is a time when I pray, oh God,
[2:44:07] they will take these things and put them
[2:44:09] in their script bag and say, "These are
[2:44:11] things that I will not forget. These are
[2:44:14] things, oh God, by the Holy Spirit,
[2:44:17] plant them deep in my heart, bring them
[2:44:19] to my remembrance. Cause me to think
[2:44:21] about them. Cause me to meditate upon
[2:44:23] them. Cause me to make these as as a a
[2:44:28] foundation in our home as a character of
[2:44:31] our home. Help me, Lord, to be the kind
[2:44:33] of example that I will raise and rear my
[2:44:35] children in. And give them an example of
[2:44:38] honor and respect. Give them an honor,
[2:44:41] oh God. Give them a an example, Father,
[2:44:43] of what it is to come to the house of
[2:44:46] God. Oh, Father, thy will be done on
[2:44:49] earth as it is in heaven. How we long
[2:44:52] for that kingdom of righteousness and
[2:44:54] that kingdom of bliss, Father, where
[2:44:57] where everything is as balanced as it
[2:45:00] should be and everything's in harmony.
[2:45:02] Oh God, I pray you'll bless the bride of
[2:45:04] Jesus Christ wherever she is gathered,
[2:45:08] wherever in purity of heart and soul. Oh
[2:45:10] God, they're embracing this word.
[2:45:13] Father, I pray that you will help us now
[2:45:16] in the name of Jesus Christ for your
[2:45:18] glory. We thank you, Lord.
[2:45:22] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord.
[2:45:24] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord.
[2:45:29] &gt;&gt; I'd like to sing. You could stand with
[2:45:31] me if you would change your position.
[2:45:33] Thank you for being so kind during this
[2:45:36] long service. I would like to sing. We
[2:45:39] place you in the highest place. It's
[2:45:42] 269.

[2:47:21] to worship
[2:47:24] and
[2:47:26] [Music]
[2:47:33] going to close in a few moments.
[2:47:36] I was struck by an encounter
[2:47:40] brother Brandham had by a man
[2:47:45] the other day a precious soul
[2:47:48] here in the city
[2:47:51] seen another brother
[2:47:53] and he said where's Bill at?
[2:47:59] He said he's going up in Canada.
[2:48:02] He said, "I guess he's going to
[2:48:04] hunting."
[2:48:06] He said, the brother said, "Yes, he's
[2:48:08] going hunting." He said, "Ah,
[2:48:12] nonsense to such stuff."
[2:48:15] [Music]
[2:48:18] He said, "All right." The man not
[2:48:21] knowing
[2:48:23] that I was under the power of the Holy
[2:48:26] Spirit by a vision of thus sayeth the
[2:48:30] Lord to go.
[2:48:34] You folks don't know what this
[2:48:36] &gt;&gt; really means to me. Do you know why
[2:48:39] &gt;&gt; I was up there?
[2:48:41] &gt;&gt; Do you know why Bud Southwick was up
[2:48:43] there?
[2:48:44] &gt;&gt; Do you know why his wife Laya was up
[2:48:46] there?
[2:48:48] At least and a few other souls.
[2:48:53] And this man, even the first word,
[2:48:57] where's Bill at?
[2:49:01] I think it would have been better. Say,
[2:49:02] where's brother Brandham at?
[2:49:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said those children
[2:49:08] that went out, he said their parents
[2:49:10] should have told them.
[2:49:13] &gt;&gt; When you see him now, we don't
[2:49:14] understand,
[2:49:16] you know, all this business about Elijah
[2:49:18] going up and all this. We don't
[2:49:20] understand that.
[2:49:22] But if you see him,
[2:49:25] you say, "How do you do, Reverend?
[2:49:31] Even though you don't understand it, you
[2:49:33] say, "How do you do, Reverend? How do
[2:49:35] you do, sir?" And go on your way and
[2:49:37] don't say anything.
[2:49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:39] &gt;&gt; That was their instruction.
[2:49:43] &gt;&gt; Congregation, are you hearing me?
[2:49:46] [Music]
[2:49:50] If you can take this service into your
[2:49:52] heart and soul
[2:49:54] &gt;&gt; and say I am going to make that as part
[2:49:56] of a important fabric of my life,
[2:49:59] &gt;&gt; you'll find your life start to be
[2:50:01] benefited.
[2:50:03] &gt;&gt; Where's Bill at? And I want to
[2:50:06] apologize. I said at the last Sunday,
[2:50:08] don't call me brother Ed. Well, of
[2:50:10] course, call me brother Ed.
[2:50:13] I understand that. I sign all my letters
[2:50:15] and emails. Brother Ed, you understand?
[2:50:19] I'm not talking about myself. I'm
[2:50:21] talking about him.
[2:50:24] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about he who is the message
[2:50:26] because I have I believe I do have a
[2:50:28] revelation that this word is none other
[2:50:32] than the living person of Jesus Christ.
[2:50:35] &gt;&gt; I approach it. I read it. I weep over
[2:50:38] it. Ears come to my eyes. Tears come to
[2:50:40] my eyes often because I engage with the
[2:50:44] person. Oh God, it's so wonderful that
[2:50:47] you would do that.
[2:50:49] &gt;&gt; It's so wonderful that you would say
[2:50:50] that.
[2:50:51] &gt;&gt; And if you feel quickened at all when I
[2:50:53] come to the pulpit or and these other
[2:50:55] men of God come to the pulpit, that's
[2:50:57] why
[2:50:59] &gt;&gt; because we had some engagement with him.
[2:51:01] To me, it's not a book.
[2:51:06] &gt;&gt; It's not just a book. I carry it around
[2:51:09] with me.
[2:51:11] &gt;&gt; Whatever I'm studying, I carry it with
[2:51:13] me because I'm having a relationship. I
[2:51:16] want
[2:51:16] &gt;&gt; that person with me.
[2:51:19] [Music]
[2:51:22] &gt;&gt; And he said, "All right." The man not
[2:51:25] knowing,
[2:51:27] do you know when he said, "Where's Bill
[2:51:29] at?"
[2:51:31] He was signing his death warrant.
[2:51:35] &gt;&gt; You don't believe that? Just listen.
[2:51:39] He said he was under the power of the
[2:51:40] Holy Spirit. He said, "What will it do?
[2:51:44] What will you do at the day of
[2:51:45] judgment?"
[2:51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "What good would it do for me
[2:51:50] to go to the bedside of that man and
[2:51:53] pray for him the first place? He doesn't
[2:51:56] believe me."
[2:51:59] and people when they come around.
[2:52:04] Now he said
[2:52:07] when they come around and say these
[2:52:09] things he said I don't know like I don't
[2:52:12] know that they don't believe it. He said
[2:52:15] so they pat you on the back and call you
[2:52:17] brother and you know they don't believe
[2:52:20] it and they don't believe it. He said,
[2:52:22] "Not, listen to me, not one thing you
[2:52:26] can do for them.
[2:52:29] &gt;&gt; They'll call for you to come pray and it
[2:52:33] doesn't do them any good
[2:52:36] &gt;&gt; because they disrespect it."
[2:52:45] &gt;&gt; The man when he opened his mouth, he had
[2:52:47] disrespect already. Where's Bill at?
[2:52:50] [Music]
[2:52:54] You see what I'm bringing?
[2:52:57] &gt;&gt; You say I I'm not bringing anything to
[2:52:59] try to gain any honor with the people.
[2:53:02] Far be it. Please don't say I'm even
[2:53:05] apologizing.
[2:53:06] I'm I'm brother Ed, too. It's part of
[2:53:08] myself personally. And he was brother
[2:53:11] Bill.
[2:53:12] Sister Brandon came to me and she said,
[2:53:15] "You know that picture you took of
[2:53:16] Bill?"
[2:53:19] said, "Well, Billy Paul got it, and I
[2:53:20] would like to know if you'd make me
[2:53:22] another copy." I didn't I didn't take
[2:53:25] that she was disrespecting him. She
[2:53:26] called him Bill. He called him Bill. It
[2:53:28] wasn't the same Bill.
[2:53:32] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the same way.
[2:53:34] &gt;&gt; When you come to your father or your
[2:53:37] friend or whoever they are, make sure
[2:53:39] that you feel in your heart, "This is my
[2:53:41] friend.
[2:53:43] &gt;&gt; This is a brother. This is a sister." I
[2:53:45] shake my hand. I'm a privileged person.
[2:53:47] Jesus hung on the cross and shed his
[2:53:50] blood that I could shake hand with this
[2:53:52] person.
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; Friends, if you can get what is I'm
[2:53:56] preaching today, it'll change change
[2:53:59] your life. You'll be the beneficiary.
[2:54:01] Not me, not someone else. You'll be the
[2:54:03] beneficiary.
[2:54:05] &gt;&gt; You can say, look up and say, God, I
[2:54:08] heard your word. I received it as from
[2:54:10] you
[2:54:12] &gt;&gt; and I'm here to live it.
[2:54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:18] &gt;&gt; I place you in the highest place. God
[2:54:21] bless you. Thank you
[2:54:24] &gt;&gt; for your kindness today.
[2:54:30] &gt;&gt; I place you in the highest place. Once
[2:54:32] again,
[2:54:35] we place you
[2:54:40] in the highest place.
[2:54:45] for you
[2:54:48] on the great high.
[2:54:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, you are Lord. We praise you
[2:54:57] high above
[2:55:00] all
[2:55:01] else.
[2:55:02] [Music]
[2:55:08] And we are you
[2:55:13] and
[2:55:15] at your feet.
[2:55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to have you join with
[2:55:24] me now and we'll just be one or two
[2:55:26] minutes. We're going to close. Uh I want
[2:55:28] to sing a verse or two and I don't even
