[16:40] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[16:44] Thank you, Lord Jesus. I'm going to ask
[16:45] our brother John Andy's, brother John,
[16:47] if you'd come and open the service in a
[16:49] word of prayer. We just have uh one
[16:52] request here this morning for Sister
[16:54] Audrey Bales in Idaho in the hospital.
[16:57] Very serious condition. Doctors don't
[16:59] expect her to make it. Want to pray for
[17:01] her this morning. Remember brother Tom
[17:03] as he's away this morning. Amen. And if
[17:06] you've got a need, you just hold it up
[17:08] before the Lord as we go before brother
[17:10] John.
[17:15] Heavenly Father, we just want to come
[17:17] humbly this morning
[17:20] into your presence. We come, Lord, just
[17:22] continuing in worship as your word has
[17:25] been so wonderful down through the ages.
[17:27] Even as our brother Rod read out of the
[17:29] scriptures, I believe our brother David
[17:32] would feel comfortable here this
[17:33] morning. The songs we've sang are
[17:36] expressing our own hearts back to you
[17:38] that our hope is in the Lord, our trust
[17:41] is in you, our confidence is in you. and
[17:44] we lift up our hands. We lift up our
[17:46] hearts, Lord, as your sons, as your
[17:49] daughters. You're raising a family.
[17:52] You're raising up a people. And you're a
[17:54] wonderful father. You've done well,
[17:56] Father, throughout the ages. And this
[17:58] morning, we just come with our hearts
[18:00] open. We just want to come into your
[18:03] gates with thanksgiving, into your
[18:05] courts with praise. We want the veil to
[18:08] drop behind us, Lord, with everything
[18:11] that's within us. We want to come into
[18:12] that holiest of holies, forgetting about
[18:16] everything around us. Who's here? Who's
[18:18] not here? What happened this past week?
[18:21] What might be going on in our own lives
[18:23] that Lord just needs to fall away and
[18:26] let all reasoning and doubts and
[18:28] questions and fears and mistakes and
[18:31] past failures just fall by the wayside.
[18:35] We're in the king's throne room. This is
[18:38] where the supernatural takes place.
[18:40] This is where Almighty God meets with
[18:43] his people. And we just want to come
[18:45] humbly, Lord, yet with the boldness as
[18:47] your sons and as your daughters that we
[18:50] can come as Queen Esther, Lord, that
[18:52] you've reached forward and touched,
[18:55] Lord, our lives. And that whatever we
[18:57] ask, whatever we would say, whatever we
[19:00] would believe, I believe is here for us,
[19:03] God. And we're with brothers and sisters
[19:05] that believe this message.
[19:08] God has been unveiled in our lives. And
[19:11] we recognize you, Lord. We just want to
[19:14] give you preeminence in our worship
[19:16] today. Forget about everything else and
[19:19] look to you, the lamb of God. There's
[19:22] needs, Lord. Hands are lifted up.
[19:24] Unspoken request. Unless you touch her,
[19:28] this lady in Idaho, Father, she may pass
[19:32] into that other dimension. Lord, we
[19:34] don't know the many needs that might be
[19:36] here. unspoken requests. But we serve a
[19:39] mighty God. And we want to confess that
[19:42] you are the healer. You are the healer,
[19:45] Lord, of our bodies, our minds, our
[19:47] spirits, our souls. You're the
[19:50] deliverer, God. I pray that you would go
[19:52] throughout this meeting and set the
[19:54] captives free, the bruised. Lord, that
[19:57] you would deal with their lives. May
[19:59] answers just come right out of your
[20:01] heart into brothers and sisters that are
[20:04] believing you, God. Lord, we just feel
[20:06] hungry this morning. We feel thirsty for
[20:09] your presence. And Lord, as you pass
[20:12] through this meeting, don't let us be as
[20:14] those in the past, stubborn and stiff
[20:17] necked and have missed you, God. The
[20:20] mighty God unveiled right before them
[20:23] and you just passed right by and they
[20:26] missed it. God, don't let this
[20:29] congregation, myself, anyone in this
[20:32] meeting or would hear this service be
[20:34] that type of person. But Lord, may we be
[20:37] real eagles. May we have eagle eyes and
[20:40] may we spread our wings and open up our
[20:43] ears to hear what the spirit would say
[20:45] to the church in these perilous times.
[20:48] We need the voice of God to be echoing
[20:51] in our hearts. And we believe we're at
[20:54] the right place, Lord. We believe we've
[20:57] come to this moment of time that all the
[20:59] secrets and all the mysteries,
[21:02] you're wanting to make them known to us.
[21:04] The mystery of your will, the mystery of
[21:06] your coming, the mystery of your
[21:08] presence, the mystery of who you are. So
[21:11] would you break the bread of life today.
[21:14] Use the minister, the man of God to
[21:17] speak to our souls as we're reaching
[21:20] into that place where all things are
[21:22] possible. May you just drop down the
[21:25] supernatural into lives that are waiting
[21:28] and hungry to see you. God, I pray this
[21:31] would be a special meeting. God, may
[21:33] this be an atmosphere that's charged
[21:35] with believing hearts.
[21:38] We believe you, Lord. And whatever you
[21:41] say to us, we say amen to that. So would
[21:44] you just have your way in this weekend,
[21:46] God, our one service. So let us already
[21:48] be under expectation. Bless the
[21:50] musicians, Lord, the songs, just every
[21:53] part of this service, Lord. Let the
[21:55] presence of God just come in a special
[21:58] way. Be with those that aren't among us,
[22:00] maybe traveling or away with their
[22:02] families.
[22:03] Be with them, Lord Jesus, and our
[22:05] visitors. May you just speak special to
[22:08] our hearts as we're just waiting, God.
[22:11] We're we're just quivering, Lord, as it
[22:13] was, just wanting to know what you would
[22:14] drop down into our lives. Strengthen us
[22:17] with a mighty hand, God. and go out and
[22:20] minister to your people today across the
[22:22] the nations of the land as we look for
[22:25] your coming and your appearing. I pray
[22:27] that revelation would be the bride's
[22:29] portion today.
[22:32] We love you, Jesus. We worship you, oh
[22:35] God, in spirit and in truth. We open up
[22:38] our hearts to you. Let there be a divine
[22:41] encounter today with you in Jesus name.
[22:46] Amen.
[22:50] And you can have your seats.
[23:00] Want to welcome everyone. Those who are
[23:02] visiting with us. We're happy to have
[23:04] you here. Um,

[40:48] [Music]
[40:51] It's sweet.
[40:56] I
[41:01] still
[41:04] [Music]
[41:13] amen. We're a privileged people to be
[41:17] able to have access to reach through and
[41:20] feel that there is a a very present one
[41:24] that's got a hold of our hand. Got a
[41:26] hold of more of our hand more than our
[41:28] hand, our life,
[41:30] &gt;&gt; our future.
[41:32] Amen. And he's uh conscious of all
[41:36] things. He's uh he's very very aware of
[41:40] where you're at right today and uh what
[41:43] your concerns are, what your needs are,
[41:46] what mine is. And I'm so thankful for
[41:51] that. A very present help in time of
[41:55] trouble. Uh we're going to be turning to
[41:58] the scripture right away because I have
[42:00] quite a number of uh readings that I'll
[42:04] have you read with me. I've prepared
[42:06] them so they could be on the screen so
[42:08] we can emphasize certain phrases,
[42:10] certain words. But uh we were uh we're
[42:14] saddened for the news we got uh just day
[42:18] before yesterday. Our brother Lineal Y
[42:21] was on a scaffold with his son or
[42:24] son-in-law and uh he was they were up 16
[42:28] ft and the scaffold somehow collapsed
[42:31] and uh he fell. Brother Lennial uh
[42:34] cracked uh about six ribs and one of the
[42:38] ribs punctured a lung and then the lung
[42:41] collapsed. Uh so he's in need of our
[42:45] prayer today. And uh uh that's all we
[42:48] have heard. But we just are praying that
[42:51] God will raise them up because they uh
[42:54] the Leon brothers uh have all planned
[42:57] they've got their tickets and everything
[42:58] to be here with us for the family camp
[43:01] and we certainly want them to be here.
[43:03] So we think this is just uh you know we
[43:05] can only regard this as the enemy
[43:08] &gt;&gt; of God's program and we believe that God
[43:11] wanted them to be here along with their
[43:13] pastor brother Donnie Reagan for the
[43:15] family camp in August. So we're going to
[43:18] have prayer for brother Lennial and all
[43:21] it takes is one touch.
[43:24] I'll never forget I was with brother
[43:26] Billy Paul on one occasion. I I think he
[43:28] was just repeating what his dad said.
[43:30] Just one touch.
[43:32] Just one touch just from him
[43:35] &gt;&gt; that we just finished singing about the
[43:36] unseen hand.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Now we want that unseen hand just to
[43:40] come and touch not only each of our
[43:43] lives but touch brother Lenal and anyone
[43:46] that we may have on our heart today. I'm
[43:49] sure if I ask for hands which I don't
[43:52] need to. I have people on my heart. I
[43:56] just will not get I whatever spirit is
[43:59] in me won't let them go. And I'm so glad
[44:02] for that spirit because it wouldn't let
[44:04] me go. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[44:07] Hallelujah. That's our God. A very
[44:10] present God. He's just uh uh desiring to
[44:15] meet our faith and answer to our faith.
[44:19] Amen. We're needy people, folks.
[44:22] We're needy people. I said
[44:26] &gt;&gt; very needy people. and don't let the
[44:28] devil, you know, kind of uh veil us and
[44:32] blind us to the time that we're in. We
[44:35] have very real needs and we want to see
[44:39] God uh break through and answer and see
[44:44] the answer and so that his name will be
[44:47] glorified. That's our desire. So, if you
[44:50] would just stand and we're going to pray
[44:53] and I going to ask that we'll sing
[44:55] first. All that I have, all that I am,
[45:03] all that I am,
[45:08] all that
[45:10] I am,
[45:14] all I shall ever
[45:19] be.
[45:24] I
[45:28] love
[45:30] I
[45:34] [Applause]
[45:36] surrender
[45:37] to thee.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing it once again. Think of
[45:42] every word now.
[45:45] [Music]
[45:46] &gt;&gt; All that I have. All that I am,
[45:53] all I ever shall ever
[45:58] be.
[46:00] Oh God, you must know
[46:07] the
[46:09] I
[46:15] surrender
[46:16] to thee.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; That is what is in our hearts. Dear Lord
[46:24] Jesus, I surrender all to thee. Oh, God
[46:29] of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob.
[46:34] You're the object they worshiped and we
[46:36] worship you. Years of time and the span
[46:41] of time separates us from them, but it
[46:44] is not separated from you because you
[46:47] are eternal.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; And the day that they worshiped you is
[46:50] as as a few moments ago. And here we
[46:53] are. are the spiritual seed of Abraham.
[46:58] Believing with the faith of our father
[47:01] Abraham, believing that we have
[47:04] received, oh God, that very same spirit,
[47:07] Elohim has manifested himself to show
[47:11] that he's alive. He is not dead. He's
[47:15] not in the grave. not alive just merely
[47:18] yesterday or years ago, but alive
[47:21] presently, waiting to hear our prayer
[47:24] and waiting to answer it. And I pray, oh
[47:27] God, that you will flood over this
[47:29] congregation today, Lord, that you'll
[47:32] reach deep with that unseen hand down
[47:35] into the very realm of the soul. Oh
[47:37] Lord, we're not interested in having
[47:40] just the flesh uh enthused. We're not
[47:43] interested just having the spirit
[47:45] inspired. We want, oh God, that the word
[47:49] of God will come down that channel of
[47:51] faith into the soul. And by hearing the
[47:55] word, we'll receive the faith that's
[47:57] necessary and essential for today's life
[48:00] and today's walk. Grant it, oh God, in
[48:04] the name of Jesus Christ. We're praying
[48:05] for brother Lenol y. Lord, let the
[48:08] unseen hand reach through to the room
[48:11] and to the bed, wherever he might be at
[48:13] this time in the name of Jesus Christ.
[48:15] Raise him up as you have raised others
[48:17] up that are sitting here with us today.
[48:20] Some are not here because they're
[48:21] afflicted or sickened. I pray, oh God,
[48:24] you'll rebuke the enemy on our behalf
[48:26] and drive him far from the camp. And may
[48:29] the people be healed by the master, our
[48:33] great physician, our Lord Jesus Christ,
[48:35] that you'll be glorified. And now anoint
[48:37] us, Lord. We need that anointed word,
[48:41] not the wisdom of man, not some fine
[48:44] presentation, but I pray that it'll be
[48:47] the Holy Ghost that will take the word
[48:49] and deliver it to every heart, Lord. And
[48:52] may we be uh may we be stirred by that
[48:55] word in the name of Jesus Christ. We can
[48:58] say with a songwriter, my heart is
[49:00] stirred whenever I think of Jesus. Oh
[49:04] Lord, how blessed and how wonderful and
[49:07] how lovely you are. Come, I pray. And
[49:10] just your presence, Lord, with us will
[49:13] just be sufficient for us because we
[49:15] know where your presence is. The
[49:17] supernatural is happening. We give
[49:19] ourselves to you now completely.
[49:22] Anoint myself, Father, and the hearers.
[49:26] Anoint all who are streaming into their
[49:30] room, into their hearts. Oh God, bless
[49:34] them. I pray in the name of Jesus
[49:37] Christ. Amen. Amen.
[49:40] God bless you. Well, I trust that you've
[49:43] had a good time as you've been uh
[49:46] reading and absorbing
[49:49] the unveiling of God. I know many of you
[49:52] have and been getting the books printed
[49:53] and that's wonderful.
[49:56] Amen.
[49:58] I'd like to read in Philippians.
[50:05] Second chapter
[50:16] and I have this on the
[50:19] screen as well.
[50:26] All right.
[50:30] Let this mind
[50:33] be in you
[50:35] which was also in Christ Jesus.
[50:42] who being in the form of God, thought it
[50:45] not robbery to be equal with God, but
[50:48] made himself of no reputation,
[50:51] and took upon him the form of a servant,
[50:55] and was made in the likeness of men.
[51:00] I want to read also in second
[51:02] Corinthians
[51:05] uh the third chapter in verse 18.
[51:18] For those of you that don't have the
[51:19] Bible, we have it on the screen as well.
[51:21] But we all with open face, beholding as
[51:25] in the in a glass the glory of the Lord
[51:29] are changed into the same image from
[51:32] glory to glory, even as by the spirit of
[51:35] the Lord. And because it starts out by
[51:38] but we all I think that we all should
[51:41] read that together. But we all with open
[51:45] face beholding as in a glass the glory
[51:49] of the Lord are changed into the same
[51:52] image from glory to glory even as by the
[51:57] spirit of the Lord. Amen. You may be
[52:00] seated.
[52:06] These first first verses we read out of
[52:09] Philippians
[52:10] really in my mind I just jotted down. It
[52:13] seems like it's the personification of
[52:16] contrast
[52:18] because it says
[52:20] who being in the form of God
[52:25] and you can't really get any higher than
[52:27] that. who being in the form of God,
[52:30] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[52:32] God, but made himself of no reputation,
[52:36] and took upon him the form of a servant.
[52:40] So, the form of God to the form of a
[52:44] servant is uh is about as far apart as
[52:48] you can get because one is the the
[52:52] supreme being, the creator. We have all
[52:56] kinds of terms
[52:58] uh of God. We can't begin to grasp him.
[53:02] The prophet said if we try to try to
[53:05] determine he how can you describe God
[53:08] that fills all time and space. God who
[53:13] has uh been forever. He's eternal. No
[53:17] beginning. Our minds fail us right
[53:19] there. And no end. Our minds fail us
[53:22] again. We can't grasp that. But
[53:25] nevertheless, we do believe that this
[53:28] great they call a great deity or this
[53:32] eternal one or whatever kind of people
[53:34] from all over uh the lands and around
[53:37] the globe and for all the centuries have
[53:39] tried to uh you know get some definition
[53:43] of God. But that's why God said to Moses
[53:45] that you will make no image. you'll make
[53:48] nothing to to appear like unto me
[53:52] because there is no fixed image of God.
[53:55] And God made himself a servant and in
[53:59] that form he began to make himself
[54:02] known. It wasn't just that he came in
[54:05] the flesh as it speaks of in John's
[54:07] gospel in the word which was the logos
[54:10] that went out from God. that word and
[54:13] even these even these few words are are
[54:17] beyond our capacity to how do we
[54:20] determine and how can we visualize that
[54:22] that word came down and materialized in
[54:26] a person called Jesus Christ and the
[54:28] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[54:31] and we beheld his glory the glory as of
[54:35] the only begotten of the father full of
[54:37] grace and truth and yet it was this you
[54:41] can see that John is with that uh he had
[54:45] that uh uh prophetic. He had the spirit
[54:48] of the eagle. He was a prophet. He was a
[54:52] prophet apostle in that sense. And as as
[54:56] we know, Matthew had one. Matthew and
[54:59] Luke and and Matthew, Luke, Mark,
[55:02] Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And John,
[55:05] he's starting off different. In the
[55:07] beginning was the word and the word was
[55:10] made flesh. In the beginning was the
[55:12] word and the word was with God and the
[55:14] word was God and that word was made
[55:17] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[55:20] his glory. Well, there was multitudes
[55:23] and multitudes of people that beheld him
[55:25] but they didn't behold his glory. So
[55:27] John is seeing something and I want to
[55:30] continue on from last Sunday which is
[55:33] from human knowledge to revelation. So
[55:36] John is going beyond human knowledge
[55:39] when he writes this
[55:41] &gt;&gt; goes beyond our human knowledge. We
[55:43] can't grasp even these words but he's
[55:46] speaking them by the inspiration of the
[55:49] Holy Ghost because the Holy Spirit is
[55:51] the author of this word.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the and and they saw his glory
[55:57] and beheld it.
[56:00] And then the Apostle Paul also says as
[56:03] we read, "And we are we all with open
[56:06] face beholding as in a glass the glory
[56:09] of the Lord." So we're to behold
[56:12] something. We're to behold something of
[56:13] his glory. We're not just churchgoers,
[56:17] &gt;&gt; but we're to behold something. We're to
[56:19] see something. And by seeing it, it is
[56:22] to it's to have an effect on us and to
[56:25] have a a transforming effect. It changes
[56:28] us. And then from glory to glory or from
[56:31] revelation to revelation as Moses said
[56:34] to God uh he he wanted to see God and
[56:37] God said no man has seen my face but he
[56:41] said I'll put you in the cliff of the
[56:42] rock as I pass by. Moses said let me see
[56:45] your glory. He wanted to see his glory.
[56:49] And when he used that then God answered
[56:51] back no one has seen my face. Because he
[56:54] knew what Moses was asking. I want to
[56:57] see you face to face. That was reserved
[57:00] for an end time generation. We were to
[57:03] see him face to face.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In other words, in all of
[57:08] his glory. But often, as it has been
[57:11] always, we don't perhaps recognize, and
[57:16] I want to stress that because I want to
[57:18] be speaking partly on that, recognizing
[57:23] uh he who's amongst us at this time.
[57:26] It's always been uh I think a a very sad
[57:31] and serious mistake that people have
[57:33] made all down through history. And you
[57:36] find that they scarcely ever recognize
[57:41] God in their time.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; They have God of expectation
[57:48] and God of the past. But I don't know
[57:51] what's wrong with us humans. We seem to
[57:54] fail to see and recognize actually
[57:58] recognize. And I'll be going into that
[58:00] word of recognition to recognize who he
[58:03] is right at this time at this moment.
[58:06] And I say that with a w with a great
[58:10] deal of feeling because I for one who
[58:13] was eyewitness to some of the uh
[58:16] ministry of the prophet of God. I for
[58:19] one have regretted so much. I said, "Why
[58:22] didn't I have a tape recorder going? Why
[58:25] didn't I have a camera going all time?
[58:27] Why didn't I record? You know why?
[58:29] Because I was too slow.
[58:32] I didn't recognize. People often say,
[58:35] "Well, when did you recognize it?" I
[58:37] don't know if we ever actually
[58:39] recognized to the full capacity
[58:43] what it was. And not only what it was,
[58:47] and you might say, "Oh, brother Ed, how
[58:49] could you miss such an opportunity?"
[58:51] Well, I'll just I have news for you.
[58:52] You're missing it right now
[58:55] &gt;&gt; because you're the same God. Amen.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; The same God that was back there.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Same God that was 40 years ago. The same
[59:02] God that was 2,000 years ago in Jesus
[59:04] Christ. They missed it in Jesus Christ.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; They missed it in the Apostle Paul. Can
[59:08] you imagine if we if I could say, "Well,
[59:10] we're having a a a a rare meeting this
[59:13] morning. We have the Apostle Paul here
[59:16] to speak." But the same Apostle Paul
[59:18] said, "Have I become your enemy because
[59:20] I've told you the truth?"
[59:23] &gt;&gt; So they were not recognizing. Do you
[59:25] think that they jumped all around and
[59:27] danced and said, "Praise God, we've got
[59:28] the first church age messenger around
[59:30] us." No, they didn't even know it.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; That was perhaps reserved for a
[59:36] different time. But it's always it
[59:38] always has been and I suppose it always
[59:42] will be that we don't recognize
[59:46] uh we don't recognize who it is that's
[59:50] amongst us. And the other thing is we
[59:53] find this also in the world the the
[59:56] recognition of famous people most of it
[1:00:00] is after they're dead.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; That's when the recognition is artists
[1:00:05] for example artists I know famous
[1:00:08] artists and they were long gone. They
[1:00:11] get famous usually after they pass away
[1:00:14] and then their works become more
[1:00:16] valuable. People say well when did he
[1:00:19] die? you know, well, he or she they
[1:00:22] died, you know, in the last century or
[1:00:25] they died in the 1800s and and their
[1:00:28] works become more and more valuable. Of
[1:00:30] course, people, you know, they see
[1:00:32] something in their art and and they
[1:00:35] critique their art and so on and so
[1:00:37] forth. or there's other people and they
[1:00:39] have they've contributed some marvelous
[1:00:42] things to the world and to the people
[1:00:47] but their recognition mostly for the
[1:00:49] most part not always but for the most
[1:00:51] part is after they're gone. Isn't that
[1:00:55] not so?
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; And spiritually it's exactly the same
[1:00:59] that recognition is after uh a person is
[1:01:03] gone.
[1:01:05] Now we've just read that the
[1:01:08] uh that he was in the form of God and he
[1:01:13] thought robbery to be equal with God but
[1:01:15] he made himself a no reputation and took
[1:01:18] upon him the form of a servant. It's the
[1:01:22] fact that he became as the form in the
[1:01:25] form of a servant is what made it almost
[1:01:29] almost impossible to recognize who he
[1:01:32] was. But I say almost because that is
[1:01:37] where the human
[1:01:40] understanding and knowledge ceases. And
[1:01:43] as I said last Sunday in this chasm
[1:01:46] between human understanding and
[1:01:49] revelation, you know, we've you've often
[1:01:52] heard and we've confessed and we've
[1:01:54] preached that Christ is in us. Now, uh
[1:02:00] Christ is in his bride. I can use the
[1:02:02] quotes and if it remains a quote, it
[1:02:05] just won't mean anything to us. And I'm
[1:02:07] here this morning. I'm preaching it
[1:02:09] myself because I've been praying all
[1:02:12] through these studies. God, make it make
[1:02:15] it so real to me. Make your presence so
[1:02:19] real. Not a presence that I can feel
[1:02:22] just that's not it. but cause me to know
[1:02:26] somehow within the deep recesses of my
[1:02:30] being that you are present and I have a
[1:02:35] communication with you and I can speak
[1:02:38] and I will speak correctly and you will
[1:02:41] hear and I can ask and you will act.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; we need.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God we have. But it
[1:02:52] may be the very God we don't recognize
[1:02:55] as being that.
[1:02:59] So I say almost because by revelation by
[1:03:02] the Holy Spirit pierces even through and
[1:03:07] beyond human knowledge. That's why the
[1:03:11] apostle John when he could say whom our
[1:03:14] hands have handled
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; and our eyes have beheld him but they
[1:03:18] knew who he was not for a future season
[1:03:21] or from the past but at that moment
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; and I think of our church services it is
[1:03:27] it is such a uh if it's such a subtle
[1:03:31] thing we come to church and we feel like
[1:03:33] we've kind of done our duty you know
[1:03:36] every church has its own tradition
[1:03:38] whether it be the confessional or the
[1:03:40] catechism of the Catholic Church or or
[1:03:43] some other uh you know statements and
[1:03:46] everybody has their phraseology or their
[1:03:49] certain phrases that they quote and we
[1:03:51] have ours. That's not sufficient.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; It's not sufficient for you to say, you
[1:03:56] know, Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, that's all
[1:03:59] fine and wonderful. That's not enough.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; It has to be a a a revelation of those
[1:04:04] scriptures that this is here now. We're
[1:04:07] not even talking about last Sunday.
[1:04:09] We're talking about this Sunday. We're
[1:04:11] talking about this Lord's day. And we
[1:04:13] need to have that on an ongoing basis.
[1:04:15] When you go to your work tomorrow or you
[1:04:17] go shopping or you go to the office, you
[1:04:20] need to have a a a you you need to have
[1:04:24] more than a a knowledge or an
[1:04:26] understanding. You you need to ponder
[1:04:28] these things until it's a reality with
[1:04:30] you.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't want to preach or we won't
[1:04:35] get all to these what everything I want
[1:04:37] to say.
[1:04:38] So in a mighty the mighty God unveiled
[1:04:42] before us,
[1:04:44] brother Bram says God always veils
[1:04:47] himself from the unbeliever.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; But he he he he veils himself. I'm
[1:04:53] sorry. He always veils himself from the
[1:04:56] unbeliever. But he always unveils
[1:04:59] himself to the believer. In the message
[1:05:02] identification,
[1:05:04] Brother Bram said, "I've been preaching
[1:05:06] these strong messages about his coming
[1:05:09] and trying to lay out the possibilities
[1:05:13] and the hour that we're now living in
[1:05:17] and how that everything to my opinion,
[1:05:20] this is 1963,
[1:05:23] everything to my opinion and my humble
[1:05:26] opinion
[1:05:27] is just in is just in condition for the
[1:05:30] coming of the Lord. the rapture, the the
[1:05:33] next thing and all that lacks could
[1:05:36] happen within an hour.
[1:05:39] He said, "I believe
[1:05:41] uh I believe of many. I don't know just
[1:05:43] how many, but several of the outstanding
[1:05:47] prophecies pertaining to the fulfillment
[1:05:50] of the coming of the Messiah and what he
[1:05:52] would do was fulfilled in the last seven
[1:05:55] hours at the cross."
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. all of those prophecies. He says
[1:06:00] now that could happen that could happen
[1:06:03] the same way
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; at his return and we must be alert and
[1:06:07] waiting.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; So we don't want to be putting things
[1:06:11] off into some future time that this
[1:06:14] needs to happen or that needs to happen
[1:06:16] because I think the best thing for us to
[1:06:19] do is as far as the future's concerned
[1:06:21] is to say we don't really know what the
[1:06:24] future is. We're human mortals and our
[1:06:27] minds run out of space. We don't know
[1:06:30] what the future is. But we know one
[1:06:33] thing that everything and I'm absolutely
[1:06:36] confident this almighty God has
[1:06:39] everything unfolding precisely in its
[1:06:42] time.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Nothing's out of line. Nothing's off
[1:06:46] track. Nothing is too late. And nothing
[1:06:49] is too early with God. It may appear
[1:06:52] that way to us, but in as far as God is
[1:06:55] concerned, everything is exactly on
[1:06:58] target.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; And that's my confidence, and I'm I
[1:07:01] believe that is yours as well.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; In the same ver in the same message, the
[1:07:09] mighty God unveiled. That's not the
[1:07:11] unveiling of God now. It's the mighty
[1:07:12] God unveiled. He said, "God has a very
[1:07:15] odd way of dealing with people.
[1:07:18] He hides himself from the unbeliever and
[1:07:22] reveals himself to the believer. Aren't
[1:07:25] you glad for that?
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; He unve He hides himself from the
[1:07:30] unbeliever and reveals himself to the
[1:07:33] believer. So the unbeliever can have a
[1:07:36] can have a great knowledge perhaps even
[1:07:38] a greater knowledge than we have. In
[1:07:41] theologically speaking, there's
[1:07:42] multitudes that know infinitely more
[1:07:45] than perhaps we do of the history and
[1:07:48] can place it all and the timelines and
[1:07:51] the lineage of the kings and the lineage
[1:07:54] of the prophets and can put the things
[1:07:56] together and when Israel was divided
[1:07:58] into the into two uh under Judah and
[1:08:02] Israel and and they have all the kings
[1:08:05] and so on down. I look into it every
[1:08:07] once in a while when it is pertinent to
[1:08:09] maybe something I'm studying. And I I
[1:08:11] marvel at their books. I've got a a
[1:08:13] series of volumes of uh of of the
[1:08:16] international
[1:08:18] uh encyclopedia Bible Bible books. And
[1:08:21] and and I just marvel. I look and say,
[1:08:24] "How did these men put all these words
[1:08:26] together?" Just big thick volumes like
[1:08:29] this and a whole series. I just can't
[1:08:32] imagine where it all come from. And I I
[1:08:34] have an admiration for men that got that
[1:08:37] kind of capacity to put that together,
[1:08:39] to assemble it, and to even put it down.
[1:08:42] And and I appreciate that. But I can
[1:08:44] tell you one thing, one one just one
[1:08:48] spurt
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; of revelation is more than all of those
[1:08:52] volumes.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; I give me a simple man that knows God,
[1:08:56] got a hold of God.
[1:08:59] I remember one meeting I was at and
[1:09:02] there was a great big tall raw boned old
[1:09:06] man and uh he had been a he'd been a
[1:09:09] minister years ago and I don't know how
[1:09:12] old he was but I think he's probably in
[1:09:14] his 80s and there was a little Spanish
[1:09:18] brother and he was backsliding had been
[1:09:20] away from God and uh alder was full of
[1:09:24] people and this great big raw bony
[1:09:27] looked like he might have been a farmer
[1:09:28] armor and he came down and he knelt he
[1:09:31] knelt beside this Spanish man and I I
[1:09:33] knelt beside him as well and we were
[1:09:35] both praying for him and I prayed. I was
[1:09:38] just young in my early ministry and I I
[1:09:41] I was I didn't know what more to say. I
[1:09:44] I thought I'd prayed, you know, I shot
[1:09:48] the wad like they say. I said all the
[1:09:51] words I knew to say and I prayed for him
[1:09:53] and believed for him and and nothing was
[1:09:56] happening. just nothing was happening,
[1:09:58] no response. And uh this old man, he
[1:10:01] just nailed behind him and he towered
[1:10:03] over him as he knelt and he had his hand
[1:10:06] on his back. He said, "Break him, Lord.
[1:10:10] Break him.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Break him, Lord. Break him." You think
[1:10:14] that was done? No, he didn't shoot his
[1:10:16] wad. Break him, Lord. Break him. He
[1:10:20] knows all about it. Break him. Break
[1:10:23] him. And it wasn't it was a few minutes.
[1:10:26] I just wondered when he was going to get
[1:10:27] done praying. He just stayed right on
[1:10:30] the line. He knew that's exactly what
[1:10:31] need to happen. And pretty soon that man
[1:10:33] just cracked.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; He prayed until God came on the scene.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; And what did God do? Broke him.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Exactly what the old man was praying. I
[1:10:45] never forgot that. I thought, "Wow, that
[1:10:47] works.
[1:10:49] That actually works."
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; What did he do? He got in the channel of
[1:10:54] what that man needed and he just stayed
[1:10:56] with it. And I appreciated that old man,
[1:10:58] old servant of God.
[1:11:01] So now I'd like to say it's absolutely
[1:11:03] essential
[1:11:05] that a believer
[1:11:07] experiences
[1:11:09] revelation
[1:11:11] by the Holy Spirit of God. That's
[1:11:13] absolutely essential.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm sure that we all feel that
[1:11:18] we have entered in and we have received
[1:11:20] revelation. And I believe that otherwise
[1:11:22] we wouldn't be here. But what we had in
[1:11:26] the past or what you had when you came
[1:11:28] to the knowledge of Christ and you gave
[1:11:30] your life to Christ, you uh certainly I
[1:11:34] can say with some confidence that
[1:11:36] there's certainly more for us today.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; And I'm saying that this is not an
[1:11:41] optional thing. Revelation is not
[1:11:43] optional. It's essential.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Absolutely essential. It's absolutely
[1:11:50] necessary.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; It's not necessary as something you
[1:11:54] experienced years ago. It's necessary
[1:11:57] today,
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; this very day in 209.
[1:12:02] And so the revelation that Peter had,
[1:12:04] which we referred to last week, the the
[1:12:08] revelation that he had, thou art the
[1:12:10] Christ,
[1:12:12] thou thou art the Christ, the son of the
[1:12:15] living God. and to have Jesus respond,
[1:12:18] "Blessed art thou, Peter s Simon
[1:12:22] Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not
[1:12:25] revealed it unto thee, but my father
[1:12:28] which is in heaven." So revelation is
[1:12:32] coming from the father which is in
[1:12:34] heaven. I'm speaking about revelation,
[1:12:37] not revelation of the message.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; The revelation I'm zeroing in on this
[1:12:41] morning is the revelation of where we
[1:12:43] are in the message. where you are, where
[1:12:47] I am today,
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; folks. Last week, I can't do very much
[1:12:53] about it. Neither can you. Last week has
[1:12:56] gone into history. Last week's acts,
[1:12:59] last week's thoughts, last week's works,
[1:13:03] that's gone.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; But here we are now. We've got this
[1:13:06] moment.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; We've got this time. Shall we seize it?
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Is there something more that can be
[1:13:13] done? I'm going to read a quote for you
[1:13:16] that you've read many times. Brother
[1:13:17] Brandham said that if we
[1:13:21] uh something to the effect if we not
[1:13:23] exercised faith, but if we could believe
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; the kind of faith that he was talking
[1:13:29] about, he said, and we should take this
[1:13:31] very very seriously. He said there
[1:13:34] wouldn't be one feeble one amongst us in
[1:13:37] the next five minutes.
[1:13:39] Amen.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Now, we get quiet, but that's really
[1:13:43] what I'm talking about.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about I'm not I'm not I'm
[1:13:47] not happy to simply read what Brother
[1:13:50] Brandham did, how he called out people,
[1:13:52] all that. That God is present here now.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not him. You're not him. But that
[1:13:59] God is greater than all of us. that God
[1:14:03] is prepared to even take his word or to
[1:14:06] take a a a vessel such as myself
[1:14:10] attempting to stay on track and to say
[1:14:13] what he wants. I've given myself to him.
[1:14:15] Now I have to trust him and you have to
[1:14:18] trust that it is him.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have to recognize
[1:14:23] whether it be uh within yourself or
[1:14:26] within uh your associate or your family
[1:14:29] member or whatever more we have to come
[1:14:32] to a divine revelation that Christ is in
[1:14:35] his bride that it's the same God.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; And if we could recognize that that's
[1:14:42] the faith
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; that's the belief that would see that
[1:14:45] there isn't a feeble one amongst us in
[1:14:47] five minutes. Amen.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah.
[1:14:51] [Music]
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just come to a human
[1:14:54] excitement.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; I don't want a human spirit. I don't
[1:14:57] want my spirit to get enthused and pass
[1:15:00] that off to you. This is not enthusiasm
[1:15:02] that you need. It's faith that you need.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; And we just need to keep keep uh
[1:15:08] speaking the word, speaking the word.
[1:15:10] Confess the promise. Say it is mine. It
[1:15:13] is mine. And to keep saying it until you
[1:15:16] believe it.
[1:15:18] That is why it is so uh such a tactic of
[1:15:21] the enemy to you know cause whatever
[1:15:24] kind of distraction or to place
[1:15:26] something in our minds that this brother
[1:15:28] this sister that happened this you need
[1:15:30] we need to forget that completely
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; because those are hindrances
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; and we need to move those hindrances
[1:15:38] out.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; If you have any affection for the world
[1:15:41] or love for the world move that
[1:15:43] hindrance out. Amen.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to bring you to a place of
[1:15:46] faith.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; We need a supernatural hand of Almighty
[1:15:52] God.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to continue to preach that
[1:15:55] this morning
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; long and hard if I need to because we do
[1:15:59] not need a God of the future. We do not
[1:16:02] need a God of the past. We need a God of
[1:16:05] the now. This moment now.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; We need him on hand. We need to see
[1:16:11] things so that also he will receive
[1:16:13] glory from it.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; There's some wonderful things I could
[1:16:22] tell you about over the pulpit today. I
[1:16:24] wouldn't dare because somebody somewhere
[1:16:26] will get a hold of it and and then it
[1:16:28] gets into man's hands and they start
[1:16:30] manhandling something. But where the
[1:16:32] message is going and the lives that are
[1:16:34] being touched, it's just so wonderful. I
[1:16:37] can't even give it to you over the pull
[1:16:38] pit because every once in a while, you
[1:16:41] know, somebody gets, "Oh, I heard you
[1:16:42] say that." And right away they get it
[1:16:44] down in some emotional realm. They want
[1:16:46] to go in and they want to do things. I
[1:16:47] say, "Forget it.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Just forget it. If God wanted you to do
[1:16:50] things, he'd open it up to you."
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; When God opens a door to us and we just
[1:16:55] start moving through it. We don't
[1:16:57] announce everything to the world.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; We don't announce it to everybody. We
[1:17:01] announce what we can and we rejoice in
[1:17:03] what we can. And sometimes you have to
[1:17:05] just be very very quiet and backward and
[1:17:07] almost secretive about it. But I can
[1:17:09] tell you God's on the move. Not
[1:17:11] yesterday, but now.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God's doing things right
[1:17:15] now.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; That's the only reason I'm here behind
[1:17:19] this pulpit. I'm not interested in a God
[1:17:21] of yester year.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in a God of when
[1:17:24] Bible way was formed and whatever more.
[1:17:26] I'm interested in a God that's moving on
[1:17:28] the scene at this time, convicting
[1:17:31] lives, transforming us into the image.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; And so that revelation
[1:17:43] in the message Queen,
[1:17:47] Brother Bram says, now we find out that
[1:17:49] there was three classes of people. We
[1:17:52] spring from the sons of Noah, Ham, Sham,
[1:17:54] and Japheth.
[1:17:56] He says there was Jew, Gentile and
[1:17:59] Samaritan.
[1:18:01] He said, "And if you notice, Peter by
[1:18:02] revelation was given the keys of the
[1:18:05] kingdom because God knew that he had the
[1:18:09] revelation of the scripture."
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; He didn't Jesus didn't say who God was
[1:18:15] or who do you say who does man say that
[1:18:18] you know God was. He said who do they
[1:18:20] say I am?
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; He's bringing it right to that very
[1:18:23] moment. He didn't want to hear what the
[1:18:26] what the Pharisees had said a couple
[1:18:28] weeks ago. He wanted to know what are
[1:18:30] they saying right now? Who do the people
[1:18:32] say that I am?
[1:18:34] You're some say you're Elias or a
[1:18:37] prophet or said they were Moses. But he
[1:18:40] says, "But I'm asking you, who do you
[1:18:42] say I am?" Peter said, "Thou art the
[1:18:44] Christ, the son of the living God." And
[1:18:46] Jesus said, "Blessed art thou uh Simon
[1:18:50] Barjonah, son of Jonas." He said, "Flesh
[1:18:52] and blood has not revealed this to you,
[1:18:55] but my father which is in heaven." He
[1:18:57] said, "It's a revelation and upon this
[1:18:59] rock I'll build my church and the gates
[1:19:02] of hell cannot prevail against it."
[1:19:05] Amen.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; I know as believers and I know from
[1:19:08] mingling with the people that there are
[1:19:11] times when we feel that the that that
[1:19:14] Satan has invaded
[1:19:17] your territory, has invaded your
[1:19:20] inheritance, has invaded. I tell you
[1:19:23] friends, it's time for the believer to
[1:19:25] rise up and say, "I'm going to drive you
[1:19:28] out.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; You have no right. As of this moment,
[1:19:33] you hold no right. This has been my
[1:19:35] possession given to me by the very blood
[1:19:38] of God through Jesus Christ and the Holy
[1:19:42] Spirit which has been sent upon the
[1:19:44] church. And I take the message that God
[1:19:47] sent through a messenger that this
[1:19:49] Christ now is veiled in my flesh and I I
[1:19:53] disallow you.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; I invalidate your invasion. Amen.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; He said it was a direct revelation that
[1:20:03] had been made known to the apostle and
[1:20:06] that he was the son of God. He said,
[1:20:08] "And if the church still exists,"
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; If the church still exists, then those
[1:20:17] in the church has come in there by
[1:20:20] spiritual revelation because that's how
[1:20:23] we come into the church. Does the church
[1:20:26] still exist? Is the body of Christ still
[1:20:29] existing? He said, "If it exists, then
[1:20:32] that's how it came in."
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; It came in by the same spirit that
[1:20:36] revealed it to Peter is the same spirit
[1:20:40] that revealed it to you and to me. If
[1:20:42] the church exists and I say, "Yes, the
[1:20:44] church exists.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, the body of Christ is here. Yes,
[1:20:49] she is formed up into a bride body of
[1:20:51] Jesus Christ. And you and I must declare
[1:20:55] with fervent belief and faith, I am one
[1:20:58] of them.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; I am one of the few. I I don't care what
[1:21:02] others do, but I'm one of the few.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; And that's why we're here today. Not
[1:21:10] because I was here last Sunday, but
[1:21:12] because this God that I serve is is
[1:21:14] alive and in my life now.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:21] Don't go back. Don't let your mind go
[1:21:23] back and digest the circumstances.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; You've got to look forward at from this
[1:21:29] moment forward.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; In the works of faith expressed,
[1:21:38] he said, "No man can understand who he
[1:21:40] is or how it is except it be revealed to
[1:21:46] you by the revelation of God."
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then faith in that you act
[1:21:52] accordingly.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; No one listen very closely. No man can
[1:21:58] understand. So our understanding our
[1:22:01] knowledge comes to an end.
[1:22:03] No man can understand who he is or how
[1:22:07] it is except it be revealed to you by
[1:22:12] the revelation of God.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; And then faith in that. Amen.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; You will act accordingly.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; I can tell you friends what I have in my
[1:22:27] heart today has zero allowance for any
[1:22:30] up down in out. I'm on I'm on fire. I'm
[1:22:33] cold. I'm backslid. It has no allowance
[1:22:36] for that. I I believe that when a
[1:22:38] believer is born of the spirit of God,
[1:22:40] no more than you can change your
[1:22:42] identity and your from your lineage. No
[1:22:45] more than you can change who your mother
[1:22:46] and father is. And that's human.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; You cannot change when you become a son
[1:22:53] and daughter of God.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a finished work.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; A finished work.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; The wise men. I thought of them. The
[1:23:06] wise men, the three wise men that came
[1:23:10] uh seeing the star
[1:23:13] and I have put down here. They saw far
[1:23:17] beyond the child that came to say
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; far beyond a child. And you know that
[1:23:24] there's nothing more said about these
[1:23:26] wise men.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; They left. They had their exchange of
[1:23:30] words with the with with the with the
[1:23:33] king. And they said, "Where is he that
[1:23:35] is born king of the Jews?
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; We've seen his star. We've seen this
[1:23:41] sign." And something within them told
[1:23:45] them, "The King of Israel, the King of
[1:23:49] Kings has been born."
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; That's a revelation.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; And they came to the place where he was.
[1:23:57] And he must have, he was now, he wasn't
[1:23:58] in a manger, wasn't in the manger. He
[1:24:00] was a young child. And they came to
[1:24:02] where the child was. And And now here's
[1:24:05] three wise men that have traveled and
[1:24:09] journeyed far. And they've come, these
[1:24:12] are intellect, intellectual men, and
[1:24:15] they fall down and worship this child.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; They were looking far beyond the child,
[1:24:23] far beyond Mary. I don't know what they
[1:24:25] saw, but they knew that here he was.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we've got to look far.
[1:24:34] They looked far beyond Mary, far beyond
[1:24:37] Joseph, far beyond the child, far beyond
[1:24:40] the environment and the circumstances.
[1:24:42] This is him.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; And they got up and left with that
[1:24:46] revelation. And there's no more record
[1:24:48] of them in the scriptures.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Whatever they saw, we need to see that
[1:24:54] and more.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; The prophet said that the nations in the
[1:25:01] message, the world is falling apart.
[1:25:03] Amen.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; 63. He said, "The nations were looking
[1:25:07] for something, and each nation was
[1:25:09] looking for it, but they looked like
[1:25:11] they didn't want to accept what God sent
[1:25:14] them."
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; They were asking for a man, a Messiah
[1:25:19] that would stomp out the rest of the
[1:25:21] nations. And God gave them a baby.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Asking for a general, and God, a baby.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; God knew what they had need of. He
[1:25:33] humiliated them.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; They needed to be humiliated.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; They wanted, you know, something to make
[1:25:39] their maybe their church big or their
[1:25:41] denomination big or their nation
[1:25:43] conquering or their nation powerful
[1:25:46] enough to throw off the shackles of
[1:25:48] Rome.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; But they need to be humiliated.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; And sometimes God even allows that.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; It says in God in in Matthew's gospel,
[1:26:00] "And when they were come into the house,
[1:26:04] They saw the young child. That's what
[1:26:06] they saw. That was the that was the the
[1:26:10] the boundaries of their knowing, their
[1:26:14] intelligence or their knowledge. They
[1:26:17] saw the young child with Mary,
[1:26:20] his mother, and they fell down.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; And worship him.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; What a strange sight. Oh, we think about
[1:26:31] it at Christmas. This isn't a Christmas
[1:26:33] story. This is a revelation story.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; They saw him and that was the end of
[1:26:39] their knowledge. But they saw way beyond
[1:26:42] him.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; When they saw the child, that's not what
[1:26:45] motivated them to fall down. When they
[1:26:47] saw the child, that's not what motivated
[1:26:49] them to give them the gift of gold,
[1:26:51] frankincense, and more. Mr. That wasn't
[1:26:54] what motivated them. It was what was
[1:26:56] inside. What they saw this child to be.
[1:26:59] We've seen his star. God has announced
[1:27:02] this from the heavens. We've been
[1:27:04] following this star all of this time.
[1:27:06] And here he is.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Not here he was.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; And not here he will be, but here he is.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; It was the identification of that
[1:27:18] moment, the recognition of that moment.
[1:27:21] My brother, my sister, if there ever was
[1:27:24] a time that we needed this, I can say to
[1:27:27] everyone that will hear my voice today,
[1:27:30] this is what is so absolutely critical
[1:27:32] and necessary for this church, for
[1:27:35] believers of this message because it has
[1:27:37] been given to you to know who he is.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:47] And when they had opened their
[1:27:49] treasures, they presented him with
[1:27:51] gifts, golden, frankincense,
[1:27:54] and myrr.
[1:28:05] They identified who he was
[1:28:08] in the form of an infant. And the angel
[1:28:10] of the Lord, brother Brandham said, in
[1:28:12] the presence of God unrecognized. And
[1:28:14] the angel of the Lord could be right
[1:28:17] here tonight and maybe one person see
[1:28:19] it.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; No one else. The light, the star that
[1:28:27] came over every observatory
[1:28:30] that the wise men followed and no
[1:28:32] observatory knows anything about it. No
[1:28:36] one else saw it.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? No one saw it. And here
[1:28:40] are three men.
[1:28:42] See, God can reveal himself to a large
[1:28:44] group or he can reveal himself to one.
[1:28:47] But those wise men because he said, and
[1:28:51] you can take this personally, no one
[1:28:53] else saw it because it was for them to
[1:28:58] see.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; And that is where I want to bring you to
[1:29:02] as I move through this message. If you
[1:29:06] have seen it, it's it's not because you
[1:29:08] were just favored of God, but it was
[1:29:11] that God for the before the foundation
[1:29:15] of the world had a certain uh a a
[1:29:19] certain combination, a certain makeup of
[1:29:22] his body, what he would call the body of
[1:29:25] Jesus Christ,
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus Christ. I wouldn't
[1:29:30] want you to even use that word loosely
[1:29:33] or glibly this morning. God
[1:29:36] thought, pondered himself. He had all
[1:29:40] eternity. Who knows when this came if it
[1:29:43] could be pinpointed, but he saw a
[1:29:45] certain makeup.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; He saw a certain characteristic. He saw
[1:29:50] exactly what would be needed in May 209.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; He saw exactly what would be needed in
[1:29:56] the Pacific Northwest. He saw exactly
[1:29:59] what would be needed in uh in in China
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; or in Russia
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; or in the Ukraine
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; or in the Congo or in Africa, any other
[1:30:10] part or in Tanzania. God knew exactly
[1:30:12] what would be needed on this time and he
[1:30:14] would reveal himself and that's all he
[1:30:16] can do. He makes it as clear as he can.
[1:30:19] He reveals himself as plainly as he can.
[1:30:22] And that's like the prophet of God. He's
[1:30:24] standing there. My wife listening to a
[1:30:26] service yesterday and she just so caught
[1:30:29] in it. And here I'm speaking this, she
[1:30:31] doesn't know what I'm preaching on, but
[1:30:32] she says, "Here's Brother Brandham, and
[1:30:34] there's there's a wheelchair and a and
[1:30:36] and someone else in a in a stretcher and
[1:30:39] someone else laying there. Three
[1:30:40] hopeless cases, and he calls them by
[1:30:43] name. And he calls the next one by name.
[1:30:46] And he calls the next one by name. And
[1:30:48] he just keeps dealing with them,
[1:30:51] praying, oh that they will come to
[1:30:53] believe it. And they couldn't recognize
[1:30:55] who it was that was calling their name.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Where did that wisdom come from? And if
[1:31:03] it came from eternity, then why is God
[1:31:05] giving it at that moment?
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Because God intended for them to rise up
[1:31:12] off of that car and out of that chair.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; That was their moment. Amen.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; And friends, we're not here just to sing
[1:31:21] some songs or to listen to some specials
[1:31:24] or to say I went to church for another
[1:31:26] Lord's day. That's not why we're here.
[1:31:29] We're here that we can recognize him and
[1:31:32] say, "What is it, Lord, that you would
[1:31:34] have me to do? What is it that you are
[1:31:36] asking of me?"
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:39] This present
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; God
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; came in the form of a servant.
[1:31:50] When the
[1:31:52] Pharisees and scribes and preeminent of
[1:31:55] that day, they were not impressed with
[1:31:58] him or his associates.
[1:32:01] Jesus was the friend of publicans and
[1:32:03] sinners. And so often God allows things
[1:32:07] of the human knowledge to come into
[1:32:10] conflict with revelation. He allows it
[1:32:13] because revelation is greater
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; than your thoughts,
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; greater than your circumstances,
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; greater than what Satan's trying to use
[1:32:22] today. Now, you know, Satan's very
[1:32:24] cunning. He's not trying to use just
[1:32:25] things of the future, things of the
[1:32:27] past, but he uses things that are right
[1:32:29] now.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; He uses the things you're engaged in
[1:32:32] right now.
[1:32:38] It says in the scripture, "And when the
[1:32:41] Pharisees saw it, Matthew 9:11,
[1:32:45] and they said to his disciples, why does
[1:32:48] your master eat with publicans and
[1:32:50] sinners?"
[1:32:53] In Luke's gospel says, "Then drew near
[1:32:56] unto him all the publicans and sinners
[1:32:59] for to hear him."
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; All the publicans and sinners.
[1:33:02] Republicans were known as as tax
[1:33:05] collectors and they were hated
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; and despised of the people. And so these
[1:33:10] tax collectors and and they were known
[1:33:12] to be a greedy group and and uh uh they
[1:33:16] were quite cruel could be quite cruel.
[1:33:19] And so they were very much hated amongst
[1:33:21] the people. And here the righteous and
[1:33:23] the scribes and the Pharisees and the
[1:33:25] good living people. you know why does
[1:33:28] your why does your leader why is he
[1:33:31] around these kind of people and to them
[1:33:35] in their knowledge it was an obstacle
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; but they came to hear him
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; I won't go any further they probably
[1:33:44] probably could sense a degree of mercy
[1:33:48] a degree of understanding
[1:33:50] here's somebody that could actually
[1:33:52] perhaps love me as we heard the song
[1:33:58] But the same people, they garnished the
[1:34:01] tombs of the prophets.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Friends, I'll be say it to you plainly.
[1:34:05] I don't want to be one to garnish
[1:34:07] brother Brandham's tomb.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be shine up just his
[1:34:13] ministry because it was more than
[1:34:15] brother Brandham.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; It was more than a man.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; It was the God that was in the man. The
[1:34:21] God that was veiled. So Jesus said, "Woe
[1:34:24] unto you scribes and Pharisees,
[1:34:25] hypocrites, because you build the tombs
[1:34:27] of the prophets and garnish the
[1:34:29] sephilers of the righteous and say, "If
[1:34:31] we had been in the days of our fathers,"
[1:34:34] in other words, if we had been back
[1:34:36] there, we would not have been partakers
[1:34:39] with them in the blood of the prophets.
[1:34:41] They recognized their fathers killed the
[1:34:43] prophets. They said, "We wouldn't have
[1:34:45] done that." But here, while they're
[1:34:46] looking in the past and could get that
[1:34:49] in some kind of, you know, smok and
[1:34:50] mirror so they stood they would stand uh
[1:34:54] justified. Jesus said, "Wherefore you're
[1:34:56] witnesses unto yourselves that you're
[1:34:58] the children of them that killed the
[1:35:00] prophets." Because they were standing
[1:35:02] right there now in their day. So it's
[1:35:04] possible here as we see we can look in
[1:35:06] the past and somehow we don't associate
[1:35:09] ourselves with the unbelief of the past.
[1:35:12] But let's make sure we're not allowing
[1:35:13] any unbelief in our heart. Now,
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; and unbelief would be to disregard his
[1:35:19] presence here at this moment.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; To allow something that Satan has reared
[1:35:24] up big before us that some condition,
[1:35:28] some situation, some relationship or
[1:35:31] something else and it looms up so big
[1:35:34] that you can't seem to pierce through.
[1:35:37] And God this morning is why I'm
[1:35:40] speaking. God by the Holy Spirit wants
[1:35:43] to pierce through that veil
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; so that you can be believing for God on
[1:35:49] the scene at this time. What kind of a
[1:35:51] God? A God where all things are
[1:35:53] possible.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul,
[1:36:03] he recognized something far greater than
[1:36:06] a bright light that blinded him. Amen.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; He identified that this presence had to
[1:36:13] be the presence of God,
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; who art thou?
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; I tell you that God could come into your
[1:36:23] little world
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; with such a shock and he can come so
[1:36:27] suddenly and I pray that even this
[1:36:30] morning it will reverberate right down
[1:36:32] to your bootstraps that it'll just shake
[1:36:34] your soul and shake your world. I'm I'm
[1:36:37] preaching for that purpose. I'm
[1:36:39] preaching as though this will be my last
[1:36:41] message. I'm preaching with all the all
[1:36:43] the strength that the Holy Spirit will
[1:36:45] give me. That God will shake your world,
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; shake your whole environment,
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; shake where you are in your spiritual
[1:36:53] walk with God. Till you realize there's
[1:36:55] something much more than what you have
[1:36:57] experienced. Hallelujah.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; It's not enough to believe in him of the
[1:37:03] of last week or of the past. But right
[1:37:06] as of this moment, say, "Why why are you
[1:37:09] preaching this way?" Because God God
[1:37:12] fully intends,
[1:37:14] God is prepared to do anything that we
[1:37:17] are able to believe for.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. young man just walked out
[1:37:24] because he has sugar diabetes and has to
[1:37:26] have a a needle. I can tell you that
[1:37:28] God's greater than his sugar diabetes.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; God's greater
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; than my little granddaughter as I saw
[1:37:35] her struggle. God's greater
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; God's greater than that.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; And the kind of God that I'm speaking
[1:37:42] about today is a God that can that not
[1:37:44] only can, he wants to.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; He's present. to heal those things.
[1:37:51] Those are physical. What about
[1:37:53] emotional? What about spiritual needs?
[1:37:56] You don't need to go carrying on under
[1:37:58] some great weight of burden. Jesus is
[1:38:01] here to lift that load. He wants you to
[1:38:04] cast it off.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Change my mind from these doubts and
[1:38:11] these fears and these anxieties and wash
[1:38:14] it from the human element. And let's go
[1:38:17] from knowledge over to revelation.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Said when light the pillar of fire
[1:38:33] smoked Paul down on the road to
[1:38:35] Damascus, he said he recognized that he
[1:38:39] was in the presence of God. He says,
[1:38:41] "And that Hebrew would have never called
[1:38:43] any any other spirit Lord." Besides, he
[1:38:47] knew that that was the pillar of fire
[1:38:50] that led the people out of the
[1:38:52] wilderness. And he said, "Lord, who art
[1:38:54] thou?"
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'm Jesus."
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; And the unveiling of God now
[1:39:03] says, "He came as the son of man, the
[1:39:05] prophet.
[1:39:07] He had done exactly even that little
[1:39:09] woman in all of her sin
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; there at the well. She recognized him
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; and she said, "We know that when the
[1:39:19] Messiah is coming, which is the Christ,
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; that's what he'll do,
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; not what something I heard about or I
[1:39:28] read about or something that I think is
[1:39:30] off in the future." But she see I she
[1:39:33] was she was no doubt struggling.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; She's seeing what was being done and he
[1:39:39] just asked me and told me about my five
[1:39:42] husbands and the one I have is not this
[1:39:44] is you know this is what the Messiah is
[1:39:46] supposed to do. But she'd had questions.
[1:39:49] The Samaritans say in this mountain and
[1:39:51] the Jews say in this city and I don't
[1:39:53] know where to worship.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; What's all this business about worship
[1:39:57] and what church and what shall I believe
[1:39:59] and all of these things? I'm in a state
[1:40:01] of confusion.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; I know that when the Messiah comes,
[1:40:07] he'll do this
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; that you're doing. She was zeroing in to
[1:40:11] what had happened right now. And that's
[1:40:13] why she was ready for it when he said,
[1:40:15] "I'm he."
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; I'm he.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; You need to hear that.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; You need to hear it this morning. I'm
[1:40:24] here.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; I'm in the middle of the situation.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; I'm in the middle of your spiritual
[1:40:29] walk. I'm in the middle of your
[1:40:31] circumstances. You don't have to look
[1:40:33] outside to some exterior. I'm here.
[1:40:35] Yeah. I'm here right here. Now,
[1:40:38] if
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; you can believe that,
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; I can tell you we can have all kinds of
[1:40:42] reports and I don't need to have them.
[1:40:44] But I'd love to hear and know that God
[1:40:48] stepped into your little domain
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; and changed everything.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Put you into his will and into his
[1:40:56] calling.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:00] He said, "I know when the Messiah is
[1:41:02] coming,
[1:41:04] which is called the Christ, that's what
[1:41:06] he'll do." She recognized, he said,
[1:41:09] "Because she was a predestinated seed."
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; And that's really another reason why I
[1:41:17] would like to see I'd like to see you
[1:41:19] experience. I would like to see you come
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; to a place
[1:41:24] where you say, "You know why? I know
[1:41:26] he's real.
[1:41:30] I talked to him this morning
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; and he talked back to me.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; You know why I know he's real?
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; I had something that was a great great
[1:41:40] need and I asked him and I spoke to him
[1:41:44] and he spoke back and he answered my
[1:41:47] desire. Amen.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Then you can say, "I know I'm a
[1:41:57] predestinated seed." Cuz that's what
[1:41:59] happens to the predestinated seed. He
[1:42:02] said, "Where the rest of them didn't
[1:42:03] recognize it," he said they had nothing
[1:42:06] to recognize with. Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; The definition of recognizing
[1:42:21] is to accept someone to be what is
[1:42:23] claimed.
[1:42:25] That's enough. There's a lot more to the
[1:42:28] definition. But the definition of
[1:42:30] recognizing
[1:42:32] that is to accept
[1:42:35] someone
[1:42:37] to be what is claimed, what they've
[1:42:39] claimed to be, or accept his power or
[1:42:43] his authority.
[1:42:46] Hallelujah.
[1:42:52] I already made mention, I'll just drop
[1:42:54] it in here.
[1:42:58] one of the
[1:43:01] one of the things that Jesus really
[1:43:02] stressed
[1:43:04] and that is the recognition after you
[1:43:07] know what it's not going to do this
[1:43:09] church any good not going to do you any
[1:43:12] good
[1:43:17] you know there's a lot of people here
[1:43:18] who have had you've experienced the loss
[1:43:22] of a loved one
[1:43:24] and I think about this all the time
[1:43:27] because I ask for give me something of
[1:43:31] the person's life
[1:43:34] so we could put together a eulogy.
[1:43:38] A eulogy even the word in the Greek is
[1:43:41] to praise
[1:43:43] to to exalt or give a person praise.
[1:43:48] I've never had anybody
[1:43:52] never had anybody in all my years
[1:43:56] give me a eulogy or give me notes for a
[1:43:58] eulogy with all the weaknesses
[1:44:02] and the frailties and the bad things
[1:44:05] that this person did.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Never had it once.
[1:44:10] never had once them to say, "Well, this
[1:44:14] person was born in such and such a date
[1:44:16] and born in such and such a city and got
[1:44:19] married and married to this woman." It's
[1:44:21] but he was a poor provider,
[1:44:25] he drank,
[1:44:28] he couldn't keep a job
[1:44:31] or she was a poor mother
[1:44:34] and whatever more. They were poor
[1:44:36] neighbors
[1:44:38] and this person was just uh lived on
[1:44:41] unemployment insurance and was a someone
[1:44:44] living off the state.
[1:44:46] No, regardless of how bad the person may
[1:44:50] have lived,
[1:44:54] they eulogize them
[1:44:56] and the eulogy
[1:44:58] for life gone.
[1:45:01] And how many times I have heard,
[1:45:05] "Oh, I only I didn't realize
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; what I had."
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; I didn't realize
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; what we had.
[1:45:18] I was in this city here when I got a
[1:45:21] phone call from a a friend of mine says,
[1:45:24] "I was just in church tonight. I was
[1:45:26] here for a wedding
[1:45:28] and I I got a phone call says, "I was in
[1:45:31] church tonight and they announced and
[1:45:33] requested prayer for brother Brandham
[1:45:35] because he's been in a car accident."
[1:45:38] Well, my world was starting to come
[1:45:40] apart and you know how bad, where,
[1:45:43] whatever.
[1:45:44] Well, it was a serious accident. So, I
[1:45:47] flew the next morning back home to
[1:45:48] Toronto. Got on the phone right away and
[1:45:51] I spoke to Tammy Tammy Laroo's dad.
[1:45:54] Brother Tom, I knew that Brother Tom
[1:45:56] Brown was close. I didn't want to call
[1:45:58] Brother Perry Green. There was such a
[1:46:00] flurry of things and I said, "Brother,
[1:46:02] Brother Tom, I would appreciate if you
[1:46:04] could
[1:46:06] keep me a breast and just let me know
[1:46:08] how things are happening.
[1:46:13] If you'd asked anybody in the message,
[1:46:16] anybody,
[1:46:17] anybody,
[1:46:21] is it God's will to take him?
[1:46:25] We would have said, "No way.
[1:46:28] He's a young man. He's got messages.
[1:46:33] We're ready to go back down. We want to
[1:46:34] go down and hear them." There's other
[1:46:36] people that got invitations from all
[1:46:38] over the country. And that simply tells
[1:46:41] me there's not one person
[1:46:45] And I and and it's not enough for us to
[1:46:47] look back there and say well uh that you
[1:46:51] know that was back there and those
[1:46:52] people they shouldn't have done that or
[1:46:54] those people they should have you know
[1:46:56] no we want to bring it forward.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; If we were in the same situation we'd
[1:47:02] say in no way is this to happen
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; which would mean none of us know the
[1:47:08] perfect will of God.
[1:47:11] That's the God I'm talking about.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Just in case we get lifted up and think
[1:47:16] that we're tuned in and we got some
[1:47:18] special channeling, we know there are
[1:47:20] times when the natural and the affection
[1:47:24] and the emotional overwhelms us
[1:47:28] and we're not prepared
[1:47:31] to let people go and we're not prepared.
[1:47:35] And then we think, well, you know, but
[1:47:37] that's all after the fact.
[1:47:40] But where are we now?
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; I can tell you that the gospel of this
[1:47:44] message would not have gone where it's
[1:47:46] gone. We'd all just been gathering
[1:47:48] around him and hearing one of the next
[1:47:50] services. And that isn't God was saying,
[1:47:52] "No, we've arrived at a different time.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; We've arrived at a time now where this
[1:47:56] word which I've already sent needs to go
[1:47:58] out."
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It needs to have men going around
[1:48:01] the country. And so men started going
[1:48:03] all over the place saying, you know,
[1:48:05] this is what's happened. And God sent a
[1:48:07] prophet and he's here and he's gone.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Well, you're gonna have to help me.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; If you read the church age book, you'll
[1:48:19] find
[1:48:20] where brother Brandham has put in the
[1:48:23] church age book. And of course, brother
[1:48:25] Lee Vale was assisting putting this book
[1:48:28] together. And the wording is the
[1:48:30] Thotyron church age, the Pergamian
[1:48:34] church age. And it says Christ eulogizes
[1:48:38] the church.
[1:48:40] Thotirin church age the eulogy. And here
[1:48:45] he eulogizes the church not after
[1:48:50] they've come and gone. Before they've
[1:48:53] arrived.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:01] And before they arrived, he says, I know
[1:49:04] thy works
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; and where thou dwellest, even where
[1:49:08] Satan's seat is.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; And thou holdest fast my name, and hast
[1:49:13] not denied my faith, even in those days
[1:49:16] wherein Antipus was my faithful martyr,
[1:49:19] who was slain among you where Satan
[1:49:21] dwelleth. So here's this little infant
[1:49:24] church. They haven't had a chance to
[1:49:26] have a a record yet. This the church is
[1:49:29] just it in its early early stages to the
[1:49:33] thyron church age. He says, "I know thy
[1:49:35] works and love and service and faith and
[1:49:38] thy patience and thy works and the last
[1:49:41] not to be more than the first." That's
[1:49:43] what God is actually eulogizing the
[1:49:45] church. He says of the Sardisian church,
[1:49:48] "Thou hast a few names even in Sardis,
[1:49:51] which have not defiled their garments,
[1:49:53] and thou shalt walk with me in white,
[1:49:56] for they are worthy." Not for those that
[1:49:58] had had been, but these were still many
[1:50:01] of them. Most of them were yet to come.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; And the Philadelphiaian church,
[1:50:09] I'm sorry to say, but it's the truth.
[1:50:12] There was no eulogy for the Leodysian
[1:50:15] church.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Your age, my age,
[1:50:23] God didn't have anything good to say
[1:50:25] about it.
[1:50:31] That's something to ponder.
[1:50:34] But to the last age of prior to
[1:50:37] Leodysian, he said to the
[1:50:38] Philadelphiaian church, "Because thou
[1:50:40] hast kept the word of my patience, I
[1:50:44] also will keep thee from the hour of
[1:50:46] temptation, which shall come upon all
[1:50:48] the world to try them that dwell upon
[1:50:51] the earth." What a comfort that must
[1:50:53] have been for them.
[1:50:56] But now,
[1:51:00] as I you certainly caught last Sunday,
[1:51:03] I'm sure
[1:51:06] I have a great deal of apprehension
[1:51:10] about
[1:51:12] uh what we are really recognizing
[1:51:16] within the message.
[1:51:18] And I have a a great deal of caution
[1:51:22] lest we we do not want to become merely
[1:51:26] a recognized
[1:51:29] uh body of people known as a church.
[1:51:35] We It's much more than church. We've got
[1:51:38] to see far beyond church. We have to see
[1:51:41] far beyond the people that come to the
[1:51:43] church. We need to see far beyond each
[1:51:46] other. And this is I'll just say it
[1:51:49] plainly, brother Brandham. Now we're
[1:51:50] going to go into God being veiled and
[1:51:53] how it was so difficult and people
[1:51:56] missed him because of this veil and
[1:51:57] missed him because of this veil. They
[1:51:59] missed him. He was veiled in a pillar of
[1:52:01] fire. He was veiled in a whirlwind. He
[1:52:04] was veiled in in the prophets. He was
[1:52:06] veiled in Moses.
[1:52:08] Moses was a veiled. He was veiled. There
[1:52:11] was a veil and and the and the holy
[1:52:14] presence of God was over the mercy seat
[1:52:17] and he was veiled there and only the
[1:52:18] high priest could go. He was constantly
[1:52:20] veiled and brother Brandham is going
[1:52:22] through that working through it all the
[1:52:24] way bringing it down and showing how he
[1:52:27] was veiled in Jesus Christ. And he keeps
[1:52:29] bringing the parallel between then and
[1:52:32] now
[1:52:34] Matthew
[1:52:35] between
[1:52:37] Malachi 3 and Malachi 4. Between his
[1:52:41] life on earth and Luke 17:30 his
[1:52:45] revealing he he goes back and forth.
[1:52:47] That's what it was there. This is what
[1:52:49] it is now. That's what it was there.
[1:52:51] That's what it is now. Then he simply
[1:52:53] comes down and says now he's veiled in
[1:52:56] you.
[1:52:59] Hallelujah.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you that I have trouble
[1:53:07] with that,
[1:53:09] brother Ed. You Yeah, I do. Because I
[1:53:14] see people are just so human. So, and
[1:53:17] and if you just accept him that well,
[1:53:19] how are you? You know, and God bless you
[1:53:21] and so on and so forth. Then
[1:53:24] I wonder what what posture should I be
[1:53:28] taking
[1:53:32] if I really believe and recognize
[1:53:37] that the same God that was in Christ
[1:53:39] Jesus
[1:53:43] is here now
[1:53:46] in his people, in his bride, in his
[1:53:48] people,
[1:53:50] in my brothers and in my sisters.
[1:53:54] How should I be conducting
[1:53:57] myself around them?
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Hey folks, this goes a million light
[1:54:03] years beyond
[1:54:05] just seeing you as a congregation or you
[1:54:07] seeing me as a minister. I'm brother Ed
[1:54:10] to you. You know, one day
[1:54:14] you may be gone and we won't know what
[1:54:16] we missed. I went to a church once and
[1:54:19] there was a man called brother Barry, a
[1:54:22] little Pentecostal church long before
[1:54:24] the message came and he sat right about
[1:54:26] here
[1:54:29] on the second or first seat.
[1:54:32] And
[1:54:34] he ne I never heard him say a word,
[1:54:36] brother Ernie. He never sang a song. He
[1:54:39] never gave a testimony. He never read a
[1:54:41] scripture. He never opened his mouth or
[1:54:42] uttered anything that I ever heard. I
[1:54:45] was 14. But every service he was right
[1:54:48] there. Every service at the same spot.
[1:54:52] And one day he passed away and was gone.
[1:54:56] That whole church must may have been
[1:54:58] empty. That old church may well have
[1:55:00] been empty or must or could have been
[1:55:01] empty because with that his presence
[1:55:06] gone, vanished.
[1:55:09] It was like a huge hole in the church.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; He was he wasn't close to the young
[1:55:15] people. He wasn't visible,
[1:55:18] but he just filled a place with his
[1:55:21] faithfulness and his faithfulness. And
[1:55:23] suddenly that faithfulness was gone.
[1:55:24] Everything he resembled, everything that
[1:55:26] he he everything that his life spoke of
[1:55:29] was gone. Not just his physical being,
[1:55:32] but and I never forgot that. Here I am
[1:55:34] 74, I was 14. That's 60 years ago. I
[1:55:37] never forgot never forgot his name.
[1:55:39] Brother Barry.
[1:55:42] I can't give you the names of anyone
[1:55:43] else that was around there. But when he
[1:55:46] was gone, say we didn't know what we
[1:55:49] had. We had someone faithful. We had
[1:55:51] someone's stalwart. We had a a praying
[1:55:54] saint of God.
[1:55:57] Can I take a few moments
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; with some slides?
[1:56:03] Is there service this afternoon,
[1:56:05] Seattle? There is.
[1:56:08] Not that I'll keep you till three, but
[1:56:14] And so now this is in the unveiling of
[1:56:16] God.
[1:56:25] Brother Bram starts
[1:56:27] now my subject this morning.
[1:56:30] I trust that God will reveal this. And
[1:56:33] each time if you who take the tapes and
[1:56:36] listen and I hope and trust that you
[1:56:38] will have had a spiritual understanding
[1:56:41] of what that God has been trying to get
[1:56:45] over to the church without saying it
[1:56:48] right out. See, that's that's the little
[1:56:51] bit of mysterious part. That's what
[1:56:53] takes revelation when it's not said
[1:56:55] right out. Because if it's just said
[1:56:58] right out, then your mind takes it,
[1:57:01] digests it, okay, I know what he means,
[1:57:03] etc., etc. That's human knowledge. But
[1:57:06] when he says without saying it right
[1:57:08] out, he said it's a thing. Sometime we
[1:57:10] have to say things in such a way that it
[1:57:13] might thin down, it might bring some to
[1:57:16] go out, some to leave, and some to
[1:57:19] ponder. And I embolded
[1:57:22] that and underlined it because I believe
[1:57:24] that's what pertains to us. And I trust
[1:57:27] that these last Sunday, this service
[1:57:29] also will be one that causes us to
[1:57:32] ponder. But he said, "But that's done
[1:57:34] purposely and it must be done that way."
[1:57:37] He said, "We have to say things in such
[1:57:39] a way that
[1:57:41] it might thin down.
[1:57:44] It might bring some to go out and some
[1:57:46] to leave
[1:57:48] and some to ponder over."
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; But that's done purposely. It might be
[1:57:53] done. It must be done that way.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; So there's an element within the message
[1:58:00] and it must be there.
[1:58:03] And that element is it's done to to to
[1:58:07] say it in such a way without saying it
[1:58:10] just so your mind grasp it and say yeah
[1:58:13] I understand that because you just
[1:58:15] understand human language but it has to
[1:58:18] go beyond that.
[1:58:20] And and then he said asked the question,
[1:58:22] you mean God would purposely do a thing
[1:58:24] like that? He certainly did
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; and he does yet.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; So if we were to go back in that quote,
[1:58:32] we could say all of those things that he
[1:58:35] did, he did and he does yet. That brings
[1:58:38] it right to this present time.
[1:58:41] And he said one day when he had
[1:58:43] thousands around him, he said, "Except
[1:58:45] you eat of the flesh of the son of God
[1:58:49] uh son of man and drink his blood, you
[1:58:53] have no life in you." And the whole
[1:58:56] audience walked away from him. So now he
[1:58:59] said that one day and the whole audience
[1:59:01] walked away from him
[1:59:06] and there was a ministerial association
[1:59:08] with him. That was the 70 that he had
[1:59:11] called of 70 that had been chosen. And
[1:59:14] he turned to them and he said, "What
[1:59:17] will you think when you see the son of
[1:59:19] man ascend up where he came from?" Now
[1:59:22] Jesus all knowing he knew
[1:59:26] what the effect of those words would
[1:59:27] have on those people.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; And now he's saying, "Well, what will
[1:59:31] you think?" The 4,988
[1:59:34] they left, you know, or and the 70 was
[1:59:38] included. So he says, "But now what will
[1:59:40] you think if you see the son of man
[1:59:42] ascend up for?" He says, "What? And if
[1:59:45] you shall see the son of man ascend up
[1:59:47] where he was before I gave the
[1:59:49] scriptural reference to it in in John
[1:59:52] 6:62."
[1:59:55] And he didn't explain that.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; He never explained how.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Paul did that later on. He just said it.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; And he just said it. Amen.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; There are things that we don't know or
[2:00:09] don't fully understand the scope of in
[2:00:11] the message. We don't have to understand
[2:00:14] it.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; He just said it.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you prepared just to accept
[2:00:18] it?
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; You'll be in you'll have the benefit. He
[2:00:22] says, "And no doubt them men said now
[2:00:25] just a moment. We eat with him." Now
[2:00:27] watch this very closely. Now they're
[2:00:29] just drawing on their human knowledge.
[2:00:32] We we eat with him. We fish with him. We
[2:00:35] sleep with him. You know when I read
[2:00:37] that,
[2:00:39] you know how personal that is to me? I
[2:00:42] ate with him. I slept in the tent. We
[2:00:44] slept in the sleeping bag right
[2:00:46] together. We talked and we laughed and
[2:00:49] he would like little stories that I
[2:00:51] would tell and people I would mimic
[2:00:53] because I used to do a lot of that when
[2:00:55] I was a young fellow. He'd laugh and I
[2:00:58] mean he'd laugh till he collapsed over
[2:00:59] in his sleeping bag head first and lay
[2:01:02] on the ground and just laugh and giggle
[2:01:04] and so on so forth. And so we knew him
[2:01:06] as a man.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; But he said he said I love to come with
[2:01:09] you brothers because he says you treat
[2:01:11] me like a man. But on the other hand,
[2:01:14] you know, when I read this, I say, "Oh,
[2:01:16] God, I'm so thankful that you'd let me
[2:01:19] look beyond the blue jeans and the
[2:01:21] little cowboy hat and uh and and I'm so
[2:01:24] glad for the time you came into the
[2:01:27] automobile." And I knew it was you. And
[2:01:30] I felt if I took another breath, I would
[2:01:32] pass out of this world into another. I
[2:01:34] tell you friends, you talk about unseen
[2:01:36] hand. We have here that same God.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; And I sense his nearness. I sense his
[2:01:42] presence. I sense him invigorating me to
[2:01:46] say certain things to this congregation.
[2:01:48] And I desire with everything, oh God,
[2:01:51] let the Holy Ghost permeate this
[2:01:53] atmosphere.
[2:01:54] [Music]
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; And go through you.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Until your life is something different
[2:02:06] than it has been.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:09] says, "We seen in the cradle that he was
[2:02:11] rocked in and now does this man." This
[2:02:14] is a hard saying.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; The Bible said they they didn't walk
[2:02:20] with him anymore that they they left
[2:02:23] him. And here's the scripture. John
[2:02:25] 6:66. From that time, many of his
[2:02:28] disciples went back and walked no more
[2:02:31] with him in the future home. He said,
[2:02:34] "Here it was in this little woman. She
[2:02:36] was one of his attributes." And there
[2:02:38] was a priest representing the light.
[2:02:40] Listen, if you want, I've given I've
[2:02:42] given the reference to all of these
[2:02:44] because I've had some say, if I could
[2:02:46] have the reference, I'd like to jot it
[2:02:47] down. I took a lot of time to give all
[2:02:49] the references to all of these quotes
[2:02:51] for you. He says, "And this little
[2:02:53] woman, she had the attributes, and there
[2:02:55] was a priest representing the light, and
[2:02:57] he had learned it from the Bible. He had
[2:03:01] learned that God was God. He had learned
[2:03:04] that holiness was right. He was learned
[2:03:07] that there was a law of God. He had
[2:03:10] learned it because of intellectual
[2:03:12] conception. And he was born of the right
[2:03:16] lineage. He was a Levite, but he only
[2:03:19] knew it by intellectual conception.
[2:03:22] Young people, it's wonderful you've been
[2:03:24] born into a family that you've been born
[2:03:26] into. It's wonderful husbands, wives,
[2:03:29] that your wife or husband has prayed for
[2:03:31] you. But it's wonderful that you as
[2:03:33] couples have come to the knowledge how
[2:03:35] thankful I am that I and my wife have
[2:03:37] come to be believers of this message.
[2:03:39] And what a rest it has been. What a
[2:03:41] glorious life it has been. But it's not
[2:03:44] sufficient to learn it.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; It's not sufficient to hear a good
[2:03:48] sermon. It's not sufficient just to be
[2:03:51] moved by someone speaking. It is that
[2:03:53] you need to go and say, "Oh God, the
[2:03:56] living God that wrote that word, that
[2:03:58] sent that prophet, come and make it such
[2:04:01] a reality to me. It's a part of every
[2:04:03] fiber of my body.
[2:04:13] It's got to go beyond
[2:04:16] just our thoughts and our minds."
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Revelation is not what we think
[2:04:21] mentally.
[2:04:23] Revelation is something you cannot
[2:04:24] explain.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Revelation is something that is it's a
[2:04:28] it's not even a knowledge. It's it's a
[2:04:31] reality. It's a life.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; Anybody that's known a love
[2:04:38] a love for a parent or a love for
[2:04:40] children or a love for your wife or
[2:04:43] husband. That is a revelation. That has
[2:04:46] to be a revelation.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; If it's not, it can disappear. You could
[2:04:50] get argued out of it or hurt out of it.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; But love, love is stronger than hurt.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Love is stronger than being slandered.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Love is stronger than all of these
[2:05:02] things. But if I said, "Well, define
[2:05:04] it." You cannot.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; It has to be a revelation to you.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; You cannot.
[2:05:15] It has to be a revelation.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Faith is a revelation.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:24] He says, "And when the light of the
[2:05:25] hour,"
[2:05:27] going on in the same quote, "and when
[2:05:29] the when the light of the hour," he
[2:05:31] learned it by what he what by what had
[2:05:34] happened.
[2:05:36] Understand? He was looking this way and
[2:05:38] he could he learned because this had
[2:05:41] happened. There was a track record. So
[2:05:44] he knew, okay, this happened and God did
[2:05:47] this and this person responded. Okay, if
[2:05:49] you have that kind of response. And so
[2:05:51] we learn all of these things. He learned
[2:05:53] by what had happened, not what was
[2:05:57] happening.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; We we desperately,
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; you know,
[2:06:05] I'll say it. It'll probably be quiet,
[2:06:07] but I'm going to say it and have it over
[2:06:09] with. It's a very dangerous thing for us
[2:06:13] just to read books and hear tapes and
[2:06:17] and be able to say, "Well, God said this
[2:06:19] and God's prophet said that and said
[2:06:21] such and such and you got to do this or
[2:06:23] I got to do that or I have to be this
[2:06:25] way." It has to go way beyond that. Yes.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; I believe that we have to have a godly
[2:06:34] honor and a godly respect
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; to the messenger
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; and a veil that God veil behind. It's
[2:06:43] God's veil.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; I don't have any trouble with that. The
[2:06:46] prophet is God's veil. And so we have to
[2:06:49] have such a deep respect for that.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; But in having that respect for that, we
[2:06:54] say, "Oh God,
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; let it be known to me." Amen.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Let it permeate me.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; This God
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; that you spoke through, I I acknowledge
[2:07:04] you. I acknowledge you're trying to say
[2:07:06] something. I acknowledge you're giving
[2:07:08] an example. I acknowledge that that was
[2:07:11] for this moment.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; That that was not for 1963 or 1957. That
[2:07:16] was for now. That was for 209. Because
[2:07:18] you, God, is speaking to me.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Give me the Give me the knowledge. Give
[2:07:24] me the wisdom. Give me the Holy Spirit
[2:07:26] that I might know just how my life is to
[2:07:29] be conducted at this time. It's not way
[2:07:32] back there. It's now.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; In every area of our lives, in every
[2:07:39] relationship that you can think of.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Not what had happened, but what what had
[2:07:51] happened. And when he found what was
[2:07:54] happening,
[2:07:56] when he found what was happening, his
[2:07:58] denomination said nothing about it. You
[2:08:01] know, friends,
[2:08:05] I I I have a very very deep sense, a
[2:08:08] very serious, very I'm very, very
[2:08:10] serious because we stand in jeopardy
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; of that very thing. what has happened
[2:08:17] and I've learned what has happened and
[2:08:20] we know what God accepts and we know how
[2:08:22] he honors faith and we've learned all of
[2:08:24] these things. It's not what has
[2:08:27] happened. It's what is happening.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; And then some people when they realize
[2:08:31] what should be happening, they look at
[2:08:34] their church and say, "Well, it's not
[2:08:36] happening."
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; You know, it's not happening.
[2:08:40] And that's when the real acid test
[2:08:43] comes.
[2:08:45] say why isn't it happening
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; why isn't why am I not seeing this in my
[2:08:50] life
[2:08:52] why am I not seeing this kind of
[2:08:54] commitment this level of zeal and
[2:08:56] devotion
[2:09:00] I think that our life and our resolve
[2:09:04] and our zeal for God should almost be
[2:09:06] fanatical
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; and let the world think what they want
[2:09:10] to think
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; but we're sold outmen Hallelujah.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; We're sold out.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; All that I have
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; and all that I am
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; and all I can ever be.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; And his denomination said nothing about
[2:09:30] it.
[2:09:40] But there was a redeemer on earth at
[2:09:43] that time
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; to redeem those attributes to God and
[2:09:47] she received it.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Then he had 12 left.
[2:09:54] Now brother Bram said he does this to
[2:09:56] thin out and so on and others to ponder
[2:09:59] and he had 12 left. He chose 12 and one
[2:10:02] of them was a devil and he said so he
[2:10:05] turned to them and there's no one could
[2:10:07] explain what he had just said. How are
[2:10:10] they going to eat his flesh and drink
[2:10:12] his blood? And how did he come down when
[2:10:16] he was born right here? See, he he goes
[2:10:18] right away. He's going from that which
[2:10:20] requires revelation right back to uh the
[2:10:24] natural which is just human
[2:10:26] understanding and how he was born right
[2:10:28] here on earth and they couldn't
[2:10:30] understand it. And then he turned to the
[2:10:32] apostles and said, "Do you want to go
[2:10:34] also?" And that's when the apostle Peter
[2:10:37] made that great statement. Lord, to whom
[2:10:39] would we go? For we are satisfied. We
[2:10:42] know assuredly that you and you alone
[2:10:45] have the word of life at this hour.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; At this hour,
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; not the word of life of some Moses time
[2:10:51] or some other time or some future time.
[2:10:54] But you have the word of life for this
[2:10:56] hour.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, I announce to
[2:11:00] you, we have the word of life for this
[2:11:03] hour. We have the word of life for May
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; 209.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; We have the word of life.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; We have it presently. We possess it.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; This same Christ that walked the shores
[2:11:17] of Galilee, walks in this building
[2:11:19] today.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; That same pillar of fire stands here at
[2:11:23] this pulpit like it always has because
[2:11:26] he will never leave his word. He will
[2:11:28] never leave his word. He won't even
[2:11:31] leave it to my human ability. If your
[2:11:33] faith will come to him, he will answer
[2:11:36] your faith.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; I'm just here as an instrument. I wish I
[2:11:42] wish even the prophet of God, he would
[2:11:44] tell the people
[2:11:47] their name or tell the secret of their
[2:11:49] heart. He says, "If it would help your
[2:11:51] faith,"
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; he couldn't do it either.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; He couldn't do it.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; All he could do was manifest a gift that
[2:11:59] God had given him to help their faith. I
[2:12:02] am trying with everything that's in me
[2:12:05] to help your faith
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; to tell you and I feel I came under a
[2:12:10] mandate to the pulpit today to tell you
[2:12:14] this God who delivered this word who
[2:12:17] sent this messenger who sent Jesus
[2:12:19] Christ to shed blood for you. He's not
[2:12:21] back there. He's here.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; He's here. And furthermore, he's not
[2:12:26] here dumb without words. He's here
[2:12:28] speaking not through my mouth but by the
[2:12:31] Holy Spirit right to your heart.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; He's saying more than my words.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's saying more than just
[2:12:38] your human thoughts.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; He's seeking to bring a revelation. What
[2:12:42] revelation? That he's he is present.
[2:12:45] [Applause]
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; There's enough power
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; in this congregation at this moment to
[2:12:52] do anything.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; Anything. Anything. Our God can do
[2:12:57] anything, can reach beyond the
[2:12:59] boundaries. We have people outside of
[2:13:01] this building in great need. Our God is
[2:13:04] great enough to span the distance and go
[2:13:06] to their room. It doesn't doesn't matter
[2:13:09] how deep they are, how engrossed in sin
[2:13:12] they are. Our God is able to break those
[2:13:15] shackles.
[2:13:17] [Applause]
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; And they were satisfied of that. and
[2:13:25] they could not explain it. You can't
[2:13:28] explain faith that something that you
[2:13:30] believe
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; and it's so solid that there's nothing
[2:13:32] else will take its place.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Therefore, they knew
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; that the word that was written for that
[2:13:38] age. Notice how he keeps bringing it to
[2:13:41] that age that they were living in the
[2:13:44] messianic age, the messiahic age that he
[2:13:47] fit that place exactly. And what could
[2:13:51] they do but go back to them cold formal
[2:13:53] churches? They came out of said where
[2:13:56] should we where would we go to? We are
[2:13:59] fully persuaded that you have the word
[2:14:01] of life and they couldn't explain it but
[2:14:04] they believed it.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Every man and woman here that's come to
[2:14:08] the knowledge of the message of this
[2:14:09] hour. That is the one thing when it
[2:14:12] comes to this present moment we can't
[2:14:14] explain it. That's where faith kicks in.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; That's where faith believes the promise.
[2:14:19] If you could figure it out, it wouldn't
[2:14:21] be supernatural. It wouldn't require
[2:14:24] faith and you would not be a child of
[2:14:25] Abraham.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; Faith.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; But they believed it.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; God has always in every age has hid
[2:14:42] behind a veil. All ages. But he's been
[2:14:45] God all the time.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; All the time. That's the emphasis. and
[2:14:50] he's kept himself hid from the world and
[2:14:53] revealed himself to his elected.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Since since Pentecost, God is not acting
[2:14:59] in man. Now he's acting through man.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; He was acting in a man then Jesus. And
[2:15:06] now he's acting through man that he has
[2:15:09] chosen for this purpose. He'd raised up
[2:15:11] a prophet and was acting God acting
[2:15:14] through the man.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God was telling him, God
[2:15:19] acting through the man, saying, "Say
[2:15:22] this."
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Speak this word.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; And God acting through a man for a
[2:15:29] prophet is for people of the future that
[2:15:32] will come. His message is prophetic.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; And so God knew.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Hey, I sat in meetings where there's
[2:15:41] three, 400 people maybe at the most. And
[2:15:44] he'd say, "These these tapes go around
[2:15:46] the world.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; These tapes are going to be translated.
[2:15:51] These tapes will be played in the
[2:15:52] jungles.
[2:15:54] How brother Lonnie and I drove in the
[2:15:56] jungles of Malawi. Heat that would just
[2:15:59] melt you. I was so my clothes were
[2:16:02] soaking wet and we couldn't have the
[2:16:04] windows of the car open because of the
[2:16:06] elephant grass that was probably 10 12
[2:16:08] or 15 feet high and it was coming in all
[2:16:12] the bugs and stuff from the elephant
[2:16:14] grass. So we had to keep the windows up
[2:16:16] and we drove and drove and drove an
[2:16:19] hour, hour and a half, two hours and I
[2:16:21] was just melting. We said to our our
[2:16:25] brother that was with us, we said,
[2:16:27] "Where is this place?" We were actually
[2:16:29] looking for some little grass huts
[2:16:32] off in the jungles, way in the jungles.
[2:16:34] And finally, we looked way over a
[2:16:38] distance and here we could see a grass
[2:16:40] hut roof here and one over there. That's
[2:16:42] all you could see was just the roof of
[2:16:43] it sticking up above the grass. And he
[2:16:45] said, "This is the place." And we pulled
[2:16:48] in there and there a brother and uh
[2:16:52] Malawi is known as the place of
[2:16:55] submissive women.
[2:16:57] And they are very very submissive.
[2:17:01] And submissive in the sense that they
[2:17:03] would not look up in the face of a man
[2:17:06] who is a stranger.
[2:17:08] And they and here they had built a a
[2:17:10] fence, an enclosure out of this elephant
[2:17:14] grass and put up a little structure for
[2:17:17] us to sit in under the shade. And this
[2:17:20] brother had received this family had
[2:17:22] received the message and he was
[2:17:23] spreading the message to other people in
[2:17:26] that area. And the woman women came with
[2:17:29] a big platters of uh of fruit freshly
[2:17:32] cut fruit and before they would come to
[2:17:35] you I'll just describe it for a moment.
[2:17:37] before they would come to you about
[2:17:39] maybe eight feet away. They would start
[2:17:41] going down like this and then finally
[2:17:44] they would go down on their knee and
[2:17:45] then reach way forward like that looking
[2:17:48] at the at the earth while they handed
[2:17:50] you the the the
[2:17:53] uh the fruit and what was on the platter
[2:17:55] or banana leaves, whatever it was.
[2:17:58] And I sat out there
[2:18:01] in that blazing sun
[2:18:04] in that smell of that fresh cut elephant
[2:18:07] grass
[2:18:09] and thought
[2:18:12] I've heard him say they'll play these in
[2:18:15] the jungles. Glory.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; What's a little man out of a little tiny
[2:18:21] church in Jeffersonville, Indiana? Where
[2:18:24] does he get that kind of wisdom and
[2:18:26] knowledge? They'll be playing this in
[2:18:28] the jungles of Africa. I say, "And God
[2:18:33] found you."
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; God found exactly you. Maybe in some
[2:18:39] city or some farm or some place or how
[2:18:44] dark it was, but God found you.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; God elected and
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; God chose. God ordained that this
[2:18:54] message I'll send it to you.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; And others have learned things but I
[2:19:00] will reveal them to you.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; Say how do I know? I don't know how I
[2:19:04] know but I know I know I know that it is
[2:19:07] the truth of God's word and as I take
[2:19:09] the scriptures the scriptures become a
[2:19:12] living book to me.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:18] So he says that what I'm trying to say
[2:19:21] that God has God is always
[2:19:25] that God always was here is here.
[2:19:30] The only thing he done when he became
[2:19:34] man he changed his mask.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; This an Morphe he changed himself.
[2:19:40] Notice closely to what he was
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; to what he is
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; or his mask another act.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; Notice he came first as a prophet.
[2:19:54] Just a few more minutes please.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; He came first as the prophet and then
[2:19:58] they crucified him. His own crucified
[2:20:01] him. He came as the son of man. Then
[2:20:04] after the Holy Spirit came, he was then
[2:20:07] the son of God. God is a spirit. That
[2:20:10] was the ear new testament time. And he
[2:20:13] was the Holy Spirit, son of God. He
[2:20:15] lived through the church ages as the son
[2:20:18] of God. In the millennium, he'll be the
[2:20:20] son of David sitting upon the throne of
[2:20:23] his father David. He is the son of
[2:20:26] David. Now
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; remember between the son of God, that's
[2:20:30] the church ages in a Leodysian church
[2:20:33] age. They put him out. That that's why
[2:20:36] when brother Brandham comes to the very
[2:20:37] end of his m ministry and I was looking
[2:20:39] for it. I want to give you the quote. He
[2:20:41] says all the doors are closed.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; I can't get in.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; They wanted his gift but they didn't
[2:20:48] want his message.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; Who was the message? It was Christ.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the man. They they liked the
[2:20:54] man. They liked they loved his gift.
[2:20:56] They'd love to have had it but they
[2:20:58] didn't want the message.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; What was it? It was to fulfill
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Behold, I stand at the door and
[2:21:05] knock.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; That was Christ knocking.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; I can't get in.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; The door's closed.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; But if you'll open the door, I'll come
[2:21:15] in.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, it's the door of the heart."
[2:21:18] It was more than that. It was the door
[2:21:20] of the churches. It was the door of
[2:21:22] denominationalism. It was the door of
[2:21:24] the nation.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; Am I Praise the Lord.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; And in between
[2:21:37] and remember he said remember now the
[2:21:41] leodyian church 8 they put him out and
[2:21:42] in Luke he said he would be revealed
[2:21:45] again as the son of man the prophet
[2:21:47] fulfilling the rest of it. I underlined
[2:21:49] these things. These things have been
[2:21:51] treasures to me for many years. I'm
[2:21:53] giving them to you now
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; to fulfill the rest of it. Because when
[2:21:57] he came here and he walked on the shores
[2:21:59] of Galilee and he healed the sick and
[2:22:01] did all those wonderful things, but he
[2:22:03] was not telling the people, he was not
[2:22:05] telling a people that I've come to take
[2:22:07] you in a rapture. He wasn't telling the
[2:22:10] people, I've come to take you off of out
[2:22:13] of this earth, out of this condition.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; That was not what he was doing at that
[2:22:17] time. He came with the same
[2:22:19] manifestation, exactly with the same
[2:22:21] thing. But the purpose is different.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; It's not what he was, but what he is.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Not what has been, but what is
[2:22:29] happening.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; What is happening? If you feel even a
[2:22:33] tinkle of this of this holy presence in
[2:22:36] you today. It is for the purpose of of
[2:22:38] of bringing you into the body of Christl
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; so that you will be you will be a
[2:22:47] recipient of the transforming power.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is not what has
[2:22:52] been. That is what's happening even now.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; If you can recognize that this is God
[2:22:57] that is speaking to your heart.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; This is God that is drawing you. This is
[2:23:02] God that's causing that sense within
[2:23:05] your being. He is doing that for the
[2:23:07] express purpose of of witnessing to you
[2:23:10] that you are a candidate for
[2:23:12] transformation.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; You're a candidate to have the change of
[2:23:18] this body. That's what he's doing now.
[2:23:19] And so he came as a son of man with the
[2:23:22] same signs so that he might he might do
[2:23:25] that which you could not do to fulfill
[2:23:27] the rest of it.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; When he was here when he was here he
[2:23:33] came to pay the price.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; All the price.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; And when the price was paid he said you
[2:23:42] could say it with me. It is finished.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; It was done. Amen.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; But now he comes the same ride, the same
[2:23:52] Christ, same pillar of fire from Moses
[2:23:54] time till now to claim what he bought
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; to fulfill the rest of it. You know why
[2:24:03] you're sitting here
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; is because this same one
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; that's here in this building has come
[2:24:10] and he's laying his claim on you
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; and Satan tries to give you a bad
[2:24:18] feeling. He tries to give you a
[2:24:19] sickness. He tries to give you
[2:24:21] something. He tries to draw you into his
[2:24:22] severe and make you ineffective in the
[2:24:25] kingdom of God. He sees there's a
[2:24:27] multitude of traps out there.
[2:24:28] Educational traps, professional traps,
[2:24:31] all kinds of traps. And he's wanting to
[2:24:33] keep you from that because his spirit is
[2:24:36] here. It is effective. He has laid a
[2:24:39] claim on you.
[2:24:44] [Applause]
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; Let me describe it for you. And you're
[2:24:47] moving through life.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; And this grand opportunity presents
[2:24:51] itself or to a sister
[2:24:56] or to a brother. And you realize by
[2:25:00] doing it, by accepting that it's going
[2:25:03] to cause you to get caught into a
[2:25:05] certain
[2:25:06] gravitational pull. And that pull is not
[2:25:10] going to pull you towards God and his
[2:25:12] program. It's going to pull you away
[2:25:14] from it
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; ever so little, ever so gently, but ever
[2:25:19] so purposefully. And he and that
[2:25:23] gravitational pull pulls you out of the
[2:25:27] perfect will of God. And you feel
[2:25:30] something. You hear a voice inside.
[2:25:33] And you feel something moving inside.
[2:25:38] I'll tell you what it is. I'll interpret
[2:25:40] that. That is him
[2:25:43] speaking and saying, "I have claimed you
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; and you are mine and you don't belong to
[2:25:49] anybody else.
[2:25:52] you are mine and every believer should
[2:25:55] shout with joy and say thank God.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; He's laying his claim on me.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; It's not that he just comes with a grand
[2:26:04] announcement say I've claimed you.
[2:26:05] That's not the program. The program is
[2:26:08] throughout this message. He's reaching
[2:26:10] through this message. He's reaching
[2:26:12] through these sermons. He's reaching out
[2:26:13] and laying hold on you.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; And you can't let go. Even when you got
[2:26:18] discouraged, you couldn't let go. When
[2:26:20] you were offered some great program or
[2:26:22] promotion, you couldn't go because he
[2:26:24] wouldn't let you go.
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; I'm done in just a couple minutes.
[2:26:34] Fulfilling the rest of it. The
[2:26:35] scriptures tie perfectly together. Son
[2:26:37] of man, son of God, son of David. When
[2:26:40] was it? It's the same God all the time.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; Just changing his form and Morphe. He
[2:26:46] just changed. It's a great drama to him.
[2:26:48] He's acting it out. God veiled in his
[2:26:51] bride. Just a few more quotes now. He
[2:26:54] changed himself. He poured himself into
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; into another mask.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; Listen, my friends, you're this mask.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; Into another mask, into another form.
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; Not another person went out of him
[2:27:10] called the Holy Spirit, but it was he
[2:27:12] himself.
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; You get it? He himself poured himself
[2:27:17] into the people.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; You ought to be saying that and you
[2:27:21] ought to be rejoicing. He himself poured
[2:27:24] himself into the people.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; I ask you, what other church is hearing
[2:27:30] this? What other people can say, I'm a
[2:27:33] vindicated prophet of God that made this
[2:27:36] declaration, and I may not understand it
[2:27:39] all, but I believe it all.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; I believe every tidbit.
[2:27:47] walk out of here.
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; He poured himself into me.
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; I can't be the average person on the
[2:27:53] street. I can't be the average person in
[2:27:54] my neighborhood because I had God poured
[2:27:57] into me.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; Not some intellectual thing, but I had
[2:28:01] God
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; poured into me and even sent Elijah to
[2:28:04] announce it.
[2:28:07] [Applause]
[2:28:08] [Music]
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; You go ahead and worship.
[2:28:14] Christ in you.
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; How beautiful. How wonderful to think
[2:28:18] that God pouring himself into the human
[2:28:21] being into the believer poured out. It
[2:28:24] was a part of his drama.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; He to do so. God all the fullness. All
[2:28:29] the godhead bodily was in the this
[2:28:32] person Jesus Christ. He was God and God
[2:28:35] alone. Not a third person or a second
[2:28:37] person or a first person, but that
[2:28:40] person, but the person of God veiled in
[2:28:44] human flesh.
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is in the building tonight.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; I'm saying he's in the building this
[2:28:50] morning to perform miracles. If it's
[2:28:53] not, then he's not the same one. He is
[2:28:55] the same one.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; But he does it through his church.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; He does it through his people. That's
[2:29:01] the God that is in you.
[2:29:05] They shall lay hands on the sick and
[2:29:07] they shall recover.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; That's a God who can't lie.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; That's a God who is there's no untruth
[2:29:14] in him. He can't lie. They shall lay
[2:29:17] hands on the sick. They shall recover.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; That's a God that's present. He said in
[2:29:28] the building now,
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; they shall recover in my name. They
[2:29:33] shall cast out evil spirits. The
[2:29:35] commission's given to the church. And
[2:29:38] that's what's the matter with the church
[2:29:39] today. It doesn't know its position.
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; I want you to say in your heart right
[2:29:45] now while brother Bisco's preaching, "Oh
[2:29:47] God, help me to know my position."
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; I don't want you simply sitting here
[2:29:52] hearing me preach. I'm preaching with
[2:29:54] all the force and strength that I have.
[2:29:56] Oh God, let me know my position.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:05] Christ in you. How beautiful, how
[2:30:07] wonderful to think God pouring himself
[2:30:09] into the human being.
[2:30:14] Jesus Christ is in the building tonight
[2:30:17] to perform miracles.
[2:30:20] The commission's given to the church.
[2:30:23] If you knew positionally
[2:30:25] who you was,
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; and what you are tonight,
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. there wouldn't be a feeble person
[2:30:33] in here
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; in the next five minutes.
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; He didn't say if you could lay your
[2:30:38] hands on enough people. He didn't say if
[2:30:41] you were a more of a gifted person or a
[2:30:43] gifted church or if you had more faith
[2:30:45] or whatever more. He simply said if you
[2:30:48] knew positionally who you was and what
[2:30:52] you are tonight.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; You know, I'll just tell you uh some of
[2:30:57] some of the grammarical things of
[2:30:59] brother Benham. says node, you know, and
[2:31:02] and and when the translations are trans
[2:31:04] being translated, there is no word for
[2:31:06] he knowed it. So they said he knew it,
[2:31:08] which is say exactly the same thing. And
[2:31:10] I got to this if you knew positionally
[2:31:12] who you was, I thought he must be
[2:31:14] meaning who you were or
[2:31:18] exactly. And I changed it and I changed
[2:31:20] it back and I just left it like this. If
[2:31:23] you knew positionally who you was,
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; whatever you was Amen.
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; And what you are
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; tonight
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; there wouldn't be if you knew.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; Not if you could pray enough.
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; If you just knew who you were
[2:31:42] positionally in Christ.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; I want you to rise to the occasion. I
[2:31:53] don't want you to say, "Well, I've got
[2:31:54] this infirmity or I've got this I've got
[2:31:57] this feeling or I've got this spiritual
[2:31:58] thing." I don't want you to go by that.
[2:32:01] If you do, this message won't reach its
[2:32:04] its objective. This message here today,
[2:32:08] this morning, is to bring that Christ
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; that you've trusted in. That Christ that
[2:32:13] you say, "I received him and he saved me
[2:32:15] and he washed my sins and he changed my
[2:32:17] whole life." That Christ is here at this
[2:32:19] moment.
[2:32:21] I mean it's moment
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; he can take every situation
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; materially, physically, spiritually and
[2:32:29] turn it around to his glory. We need to
[2:32:31] say all that I am, all that I ever can
[2:32:34] be, all that I have. I surrender to you.
[2:32:37] You take me.
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; He says there wouldn't be a feeble
[2:32:46] person in here in the next five minutes.
[2:32:50] And he said, "That's right. The thing of
[2:32:52] it is
[2:32:55] you're looking off into a millennium
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; for something to happen."
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; Don't look off into the millennium
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; for something to happen.
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "When it's already here,
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; do you believe that?
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; Does this congregation believe that?"
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; I'm not just reading these words. You
[2:33:14] believe that? Amen.
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; Let's not look off into some future time
[2:33:17] or into the millennium when it's already
[2:33:20] here.
[2:33:23] &gt;&gt; And now we are the sons of God. Not we
[2:33:26] will be. We are right now. When this
[2:33:29] night,
[2:33:31] &gt;&gt; this morning, I will say right now, this
[2:33:33] minute, we're seated together in
[2:33:35] heavenly places. We are in heavenly
[2:33:37] places in Christ Jesus. I don't care
[2:33:39] what you find out when you get home or
[2:33:41] when you walk out of this church. You
[2:33:43] should have your mind set on God.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; I've got my mind set right.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; My heart set right.
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:33:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; We're seated together in heavenly places
[2:34:02] in Christ Jesus. And oh, if you'd only
[2:34:05] recognize that. And I've got a whole
[2:34:07] number of quotes which I haven't got
[2:34:09] time for where he said, "If you'd only
[2:34:12] only recognize, I want to see what God
[2:34:16] spoke through this vindicated voice. I
[2:34:19] want to know what is it I need to
[2:34:22] recognize. What do you need to
[2:34:24] recognize?
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; What do we need to recognize? What does
[2:34:28] God want us to recognize?"
[2:34:30] thing he wants us most to recognize and
[2:34:33] acknowledge and identify that this
[2:34:36] didn't happen by a sequence of events.
[2:34:38] This you're not even seated here just by
[2:34:41] an accident. You're seated here by
[2:34:44] design.
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; God knew before the foundation of the
[2:34:47] world exactly what I was going to speak
[2:34:48] this morning. He knew who needed it. He
[2:34:51] knew how it would hit and strike your
[2:34:53] heart. And if your heart is saying amen,
[2:34:55] then I want you to open this mouth and
[2:34:57] say amen. I accept that. I acknowledge
[2:34:59] that
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; this is God.
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever things you desire when you
[2:35:07] pray, believe you receive it and it'll
[2:35:10] be given to you.
[2:35:13] He said they didn't know it. Why? The
[2:35:15] Bible said their eyes were closed. They
[2:35:18] didn't understand it. They were sitting
[2:35:19] right right with him, walking right with
[2:35:22] him, talking right with him. He's
[2:35:24] talking about the two men on the way to
[2:35:25] Emmas. And this is in this is in this is
[2:35:29] his text for uh not future home but uh
[2:35:34] the the text of uh modern events made
[2:35:37] clear by the prophecy which was his
[2:35:39] second last message. But this one had
[2:35:42] that really startled me. This one is the
[2:35:44] curtain of time.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; He's just been beyond the curtain of
[2:35:48] time and he's making reference to the
[2:35:50] same scripture.
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; You understand that friends? He's just
[2:35:56] been in a translation. He's been beyond
[2:35:59] the curtain of time. And he comes right
[2:36:01] back and refers to his second last. This
[2:36:04] will be years later will be his second
[2:36:06] last service when he'll go right back
[2:36:08] and call Luke 24 a prophecy.
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; And the prophecy is it all comes the
[2:36:15] same thing. He just been beyond the
[2:36:16] curtain of time. Listen, beyond the
[2:36:19] curtain of time. He told me, I was with
[2:36:21] him just a short time after he told me
[2:36:23] he went like this. He says, "Brother
[2:36:24] Eddie, I pinched my hand."
[2:36:26] He said, "I bit my finger
[2:36:29] and I felt for my hair because he was
[2:36:31] largely bald."
[2:36:33] And he he said, "I felt my head and it
[2:36:36] was I had a head full of hair." He said,
[2:36:39] "Brother Eddie, those the women, they
[2:36:42] came and they were in long dresses, long
[2:36:45] gowns, and they came and he says they
[2:36:48] embraced me and said, "Our brother, our
[2:36:50] precious brother." And then came Ben,
[2:36:53] like millions of them, embracing him,
[2:36:56] our brother, our precious brother, and
[2:36:59] the one that was with him. He said, "Who
[2:37:02] are these?"
[2:37:05] &gt;&gt; Same as John, John the Apostle in the
[2:37:07] book of Revelation. Who are these? He
[2:37:09] didn't know who they were. Brother Bam
[2:37:12] says, "Who are these?" Said, "These are
[2:37:15] these are your converts to Christ."
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; Converts to Christ.
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:25] &gt;&gt; Maybe my theophony body was there
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; running. I don't know. These are your
[2:37:30] converts to Christ.
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; And he goes to Luke 24. And this is what
[2:37:36] he's quoting right here just as I bring
[2:37:38] it to a windown. And they didn't know.
[2:37:41] That's the two on the way to Emmas. They
[2:37:43] didn't know why the Bible why the Bible
[2:37:46] said their eyes were closed and they
[2:37:48] didn't understand. They were sitting
[2:37:51] right with him, walking right with him,
[2:37:54] talking right with him. They had they
[2:37:56] had eating with him and didn't know who
[2:38:00] he was. And friend, that's as true as it
[2:38:04] could be today.
[2:38:06] That's as true as I'm standing on this
[2:38:09] platform that the resurrected Jesus
[2:38:12] Christ is right in this building talking
[2:38:15] to individuals right now. If you could
[2:38:18] only recognize that that's his voice.
[2:38:21] [Applause]
[2:38:31] That's his voice.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; I preached what God put on my heart.
[2:38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; But the same as a wise man looked had to
[2:38:45] look beyond the child. You'll have to
[2:38:47] look beyond this.
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:52] &gt;&gt; And you're going to go and probably sit
[2:38:54] and eat with somebody today. He says
[2:38:57] they ate with them. Lord,
[2:38:59] &gt;&gt; they were in their home. They walked
[2:39:00] together.
[2:39:02] &gt;&gt; I want you to walk different than you
[2:39:04] ever walked.
[2:39:06] And I want you to eat
[2:39:09] when you're around the body of Jesus
[2:39:12] Christ.
[2:39:14] And that you'll ponder deeply.
[2:39:16] These are jewels that make up the crown
[2:39:21] of my savior. These are those who have
[2:39:24] been purchased by the very blood of God
[2:39:27] himself.
[2:39:29] These are priceless
[2:39:31] ones.
[2:39:33] These are
[2:39:35] his
[2:39:37] bride, his wife. This is who he chose
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; of all the multitudes.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; He chose
[2:39:45] this one that I shake hands with.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:48] &gt;&gt; This one that I sit beside.
[2:39:51] Don't eat and don't talk and don't walk
[2:39:53] with people fail after this service to
[2:39:57] recognize and to ponder who this is. Oh,
[2:40:00] this is mom and this is dad and oh, this
[2:40:03] is brother so and so. This is sister so
[2:40:05] and so.
[2:40:09] If you could only know,
[2:40:11] if you could only realize
[2:40:14] really who it is.
[2:40:20] &gt;&gt; It changed everything.
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about yesterday
[2:40:27] and I'm not talking about tomorrow and
[2:40:30] I'm not talking about, oh, you know,
[2:40:32] we're all going to be changed and we're
[2:40:33] going to go in the rapture. Just forget
[2:40:35] it.
[2:40:37] You got to be going. You got to be
[2:40:38] walking in what you're supposed to be in
[2:40:40] right today.
[2:40:41] &gt;&gt; If you don't recognize what he is today,
[2:40:43] how you going to recognize what he is up
[2:40:44] the road?
[2:40:46] &gt;&gt; We're not living up the road and we're
[2:40:47] not living in the past. We're living
[2:40:49] right now. This Lord's day in 209.
[2:40:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:54] &gt;&gt; He's in the building.
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:57] &gt;&gt; Here to do real things.
[2:41:01] &gt;&gt; I defy the enemy.
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:03] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. I defy and
[2:41:05] deny the enemy that's trying to work his
[2:41:08] evil works amongst his people. I defy
[2:41:11] and deny him that right. He has no right
[2:41:15] to the bride of Jesus Christ. He has no
[2:41:18] right to put his dirty, filthy hands on
[2:41:20] God's people.
[2:41:23] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[2:41:25] &gt;&gt; I don't know whether you're going to
[2:41:26] rejoice, but I'm going to rejoice
[2:41:29] &gt;&gt; in this glorious victory and deliverance
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; of my Lord Jesus Christ. And when this
[2:41:35] brief life is over, which is just a
[2:41:36] vapor,
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; we're going to pass and take a step into
[2:41:39] another dimension, into another realm,
[2:41:41] sir.
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; And you will know that the things I
[2:41:44] spoke this morning are the truth of
[2:41:46] God's word.
[2:41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. I would like to sing maybe brother
[2:41:52] Rod, you could help me.
[2:41:56] I want to sing
[2:42:00] uh just of course first here is love.
[2:42:03] You can stand. You've been sitting quite
[2:42:04] a while. Thank you for your patience.
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; This is the only service today here and
[2:42:10] service in Seattle. We pray,
[2:42:15] same presence.
[2:42:18] Please friends,
[2:42:20] don't just go from here as a say, well,
[2:42:23] I'm a member of Florida Bible way. I go
[2:42:25] there. I'm preaching this to change that
[2:42:29] whole perspective, to change it all. say
[2:42:32] I'm a I'm a group of people that have
[2:42:37] heard a very very wonderful and strange
[2:42:39] message sent from above. A divine
[2:42:42] message to me.
[2:42:45] Hallelujah. And I'm very conscious also
[2:42:49] that there are situations which we
[2:42:51] encounter that we would dearly love to
[2:42:54] change in a moment of time. I just say
[2:42:57] to you just leave it in the hands of
[2:42:59] God. He's the master.
[2:43:02] He knows how to handle lives. He knows
[2:43:04] if I had my way this morning, I'd reach
[2:43:07] beyond the walls of this church. And I
[2:43:09] would change homes. I would change
[2:43:10] lives. I would reunite broken people. I
[2:43:14] would heal broken bodies. I would
[2:43:16] deliver the bound for out of out of
[2:43:18] their life of drugs or alcoholism. I
[2:43:20] would do it in a moment. But this God
[2:43:22] that I serve,
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; he cannot lie. Amen.
[2:43:26] &gt;&gt; And if I pray and I believe and if I go
[2:43:30] to the grave, as the prophet said, I'm
[2:43:32] looking for the place where he said it.
[2:43:33] I go to the grave in faith and I rise.
[2:43:36] He says, God who cannot lie must answer
[2:43:39] to that faith.
[2:43:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:42] &gt;&gt; And that's where I stand this morning.
[2:43:44] God who cannot lie.
[2:43:47] You can have the most impossible
[2:43:48] situation, the most impossible person
[2:43:51] just in the drags of sin and bonded and
[2:43:54] you can't say how can this ever be? This
[2:43:57] is impossible. Nothing shall be
[2:43:59] impossible with this God.
[2:44:05] &gt;&gt; Will you accept it?
[2:44:07] &gt;&gt; Will you believe it in the name of the
[2:44:08] Lord?
[2:44:10] &gt;&gt; Here is love.
[2:44:15] Here is
[2:44:20] as the ocean
[2:44:25] of
[2:44:26] kindness
[2:44:28] [Music]
[2:44:30] as a fly
[2:44:34] with the Grace
[2:44:38] [Music]
[2:44:44] sh for us
[2:44:48] is precious
[2:44:51] blood.
[2:44:57] Remember
[2:45:02] [Music]
[2:45:07] to say
[2:45:12] we will never
[2:45:17] for
[2:45:20] hallelujah.
[2:45:21] to our
[2:45:25] eternal
[2:45:27] day
[2:45:30] on the mountain
[2:45:33] [Music]
[2:45:48] through the
[2:45:53] God's mercy.
[2:46:00] Oh
[2:46:03] my
[2:46:06] go.
[2:46:15] [Applause]
[2:46:24] He will. He will.
[2:46:28] people
[2:46:33] through our
[2:46:34] [Music]
[2:46:37] eternal
[2:46:39] day.
[2:46:43] Grace and love
[2:46:48] like mighty rivers
[2:46:53] flowing
[2:46:55] [Music]
[2:46:57] from above.
[2:47:06] and perfect justice.
[2:47:10] Yes. The
[2:47:15] world
[2:47:23] [Music]
[2:47:27] Heat. Heat.
[2:47:33] [Music]
[2:47:38] [Music]
[2:47:42] for love
[2:47:43] [Music]
[2:47:45] to our
[2:47:47] [Music]
[2:47:49] eternal
[2:47:51] king.
[2:47:53] &gt;&gt; I bring out brother Moan, one of you to
[2:47:56] come and pray a prayer of blessing upon
[2:47:59] the people and dismiss us with the grace
[2:48:01] of God.
[2:48:03] And I trust that today we'll you'll have
[2:48:05] time with no service tonight. You'll be
[2:48:07] able to ponder and think about these
[2:48:09] things.
[2:48:12] I'm probably reading
[2:48:14] the unveiling of God for I don't know
[2:48:16] how many times in the last two three
[2:48:18] weeks just trying to move my way through
[2:48:21] it. You know what I'm doing? Not to read
[2:48:23] it. Not to get a message. Not a bit.
[2:48:27] Lord, help me. Help me to understand.
[2:48:31] Help me to grasp.
[2:48:33] Help me to absorb
[2:48:36] this divine thing that you're trying to
[2:48:38] tell us. I know we're in the coming of
[2:48:41] the Lord, but just where are we? I know
[2:48:42] we're in the message. I know we're on in
[2:48:44] the unfolding. I know we're in the end
[2:48:45] time message, but just where are we in
[2:48:47] it? Let me know. I don't want to know
[2:48:49] about the past. I don't want to just
[2:48:51] hear about the great things that
[2:48:52] happened. We're we're serving the same
[2:48:54] God. Help me to grasp and understand
[2:48:57] that and take it into myself. Pour it
[2:49:00] in, Lord. Pour it in.
[2:49:02] &gt;&gt; Pour it in.
[2:49:05] &gt;&gt; Will you join me in that?
[2:49:07] &gt;&gt; Pour it in. Oh, God. Nice to see you,
[2:49:10] brother Ed Nicaroo. God bless not only
[2:49:13] you, but we give praise to the God who
[2:49:16] has turned aside that thing in your
[2:49:19] body. Hallelujah.
[2:49:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, let the same atmosphere.
[2:49:27] If you are, you know, well, if you were
[2:49:29] here and the messenger was here and the
[2:49:31] prophet was here, start speaking the
[2:49:33] secrets of your heart, you, oh, how that
[2:49:35] would help your faith. But the one who
[2:49:37] has that knowledge, you already know the
[2:49:40] secret.
[2:49:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:44] &gt;&gt; The God who led this message into my
[2:49:46] heart, he knows that secret. You don't
[2:49:49] need to have it told. He's given the
[2:49:51] word to you. He's given the promise to
[2:49:53] you. Do you accept that? Do you believe
[2:49:55] that?
[2:49:56] Hallelujah.
[2:49:59] &gt;&gt; We'll just sing the chorus once again as
[2:50:00] our brother comes.
[2:50:08] [Music]
[2:50:18] &gt;&gt; To sing his praise.
[2:50:23] He will never
[2:50:28] be forgotten
[2:50:33] throughout his
[2:50:37] eternal
[2:50:38] day.
[2:50:41] Shall we pray?
[2:50:44] Gracious heavenly father,
[2:50:47] we come in your sacred presence today.
[2:50:50] We acknowledge the things that we have
[2:50:52] heard this morning.
[2:50:54] And Father,
[2:50:56] we want to recognize these things in the
[2:51:00] way you would want us to recognize it.
[2:51:05] For too often, Father, we have just been
[2:51:08] on the surface of things.
[2:51:11] It's just touch and go sometimes,
[2:51:13] Father.
[2:51:15] But Lord, you spoke things to us and you
[2:51:19] asked us to ponder these things.
[2:51:22] &gt;&gt; And it's in pondering these things that
[2:51:24] Lord, we can enter into the depths of
[2:51:27] your word.
[2:51:29] &gt;&gt; And we can fish out Lord the flesh and
[2:51:33] the life that Lord you want to commit to
[2:51:36] us.
[2:51:38] We thank you today for the precious
[2:51:40] words that were preached from this
[2:51:42] pulpit.
[2:51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:44] We thank you for a servant who has
[2:51:47] preached his heart out for his people to
[2:51:50] see that Christ is formed in them and to
[2:51:54] see the expression of sunship come to
[2:51:58] the place of adoption.
[2:51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:01] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for every effort
[2:52:03] that has been made towards this meeting
[2:52:06] this morning.
[2:52:07] And father
[2:52:10] we don't know
[2:52:12] what the fruits will be but we are
[2:52:14] hoping that as the seeds have been
[2:52:16] planted that Lord you would come around
[2:52:19] and the Holy Ghost will water and that
[2:52:23] father you will bring forth life the
[2:52:25] kind of life that you will be pleased
[2:52:27] about.
[2:52:29] Father, you taught us in your word that
[2:52:31] when we bless, we will bless after this
[2:52:34] manner. We say, "The Lord bless you and
[2:52:37] the Lord keep you. The Lord make his
[2:52:40] face to shine upon you and be gracious
[2:52:43] unto you. The Lord lift up his
[2:52:46] countenance upon you and give you
[2:52:48] peace."
[2:52:50] You said, "In this way, we are to put
[2:52:53] your name upon your people." Yes.
[2:52:56] &gt;&gt; And Father, I have put your name upon
[2:52:58] your people this morning.
[2:53:00] &gt;&gt; And as we depart one from another, we
[2:53:02] pray that these words, oh God, would
[2:53:06] bring forth the fruits you're looking
[2:53:08] for.
[2:53:10] In the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[2:53:12] Christ, we beseech you. Amen. Amen.
[2:53:17] Thank
[2:53:20] God.
[2:53:23] You're dismissed in Jesus name. Have a
[2:53:27] wonderful afternoon in his presence
[2:53:29] until we meet again, Lord willing, on a
[2:53:32] Wednesday evening.
