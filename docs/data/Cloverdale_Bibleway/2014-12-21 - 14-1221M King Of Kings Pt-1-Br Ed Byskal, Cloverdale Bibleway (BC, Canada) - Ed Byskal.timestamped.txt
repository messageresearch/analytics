[7:00] In a manger long ago,
[7:03] I know it's really so. A baby was born
[7:09] to save men from their sin.
[7:13] God saw him on the shore. The lamb
[7:18] forever home for the right crucified
[7:23] calary.
[7:26] Oh, how I love that man from Calm

[7:54] in the temple. Oh, there one day Isra
[7:59] on his earth before me.
[8:03] He was in my heart
[8:06] and his place with him. He said, "Come
[8:11] to the man from Gal."
[8:15] Oh my love that man from Cal.

[9:52] god.
[9:54] [Music]
[10:13] The word

[13:27] And all that we have
[13:39] [Music]
[14:01] A woman
[14:14] he came
[14:18] and when
[14:20] the crowd dried Thank
[14:26] you.

[15:19] [Music]
[15:25] [Applause]
[15:26] [Music]
[15:29] I
[15:34] just feel
[15:36] when you call
[15:39] me
[15:42] I was found when I knew
[15:47] all
[15:50] thank you.
[15:53] He could be my every need.
[15:59] When this prisoner
[16:02] finally
[16:04] touches me,
[16:06] he made me free.
[16:10] Praise his name. I receive
[16:13] [Music]
[16:18] in all that
[16:24] you're
[16:28] [Music]
[16:33] away.
[16:38] [Music]
[16:50] While I play that song, my sister, I
[16:52] just like to call brother Gilbert
[16:53] Okeello to come and lead us in prayer.
[16:58] Just have a couple of prayer requests.
[17:00] Um,
[17:02] brother Martin Tribiger has been
[17:04] promoted and he's gone to be with the
[17:06] Lord. Um, the funeral was on Saturday.
[17:09] Brother Harold took the funeral. That's
[17:12] uh, Sister Paula Courtney's dad. And we
[17:15] just want to remember the family and
[17:17] those that have traveled out there to be
[17:19] with them, just to have the Lord's grace
[17:22] with them. And a brother Ben Shindi from
[17:27] Bombay, India has prayer requests for
[17:29] his wife who was diagnosed with second
[17:32] stage cancer and believes that God can
[17:35] meet the need.
[17:38] Amen. We believe that too. Now, if our
[17:40] brother would come, we'll just sing that
[17:42] once more. Touching Jesus.
[17:45] Touching Jesus is all that really
[17:47] matters. Amen. Let's just sing that
[17:50] together. Touching Jesus
[17:54] is all that really matters.
[18:00] And your life will never be
[18:05] a day.
[18:09] There's always
[18:12] one way
[18:14] to die.
[18:18] Bless
[18:20] when you call
[18:22] his name.
[18:25] [Music]
[18:36] Let us pray.
[18:39] [Music]
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Lord God of heaven,
[18:48] Lord, that is our humble prayer as we
[18:52] come to you this morning, Lord.
[18:55] [Music]
[18:57] Lord, as we sang this song about that
[19:00] woman, Lord,
[19:03] so needy, Lord, and for so many years
[19:08] she was troubled, maybe in ways that
[19:11] only her would know, dear God.
[19:15] And when she reached out to you, the
[19:18] people around her, they discouraged her.
[19:22] But Lord,
[19:24] she pressed on. Lord, what seemed
[19:27] impossible with man,
[19:29] but something in her heart kept tagging
[19:32] on, Lord.
[19:35] And Lord, she reached out when she came,
[19:37] Lord, and touched you, Lord. Then that
[19:40] which was impossible became possible,
[19:43] Lord. And Lord, as we gather, we are in
[19:47] your presence, Father.
[19:49] Lord, we have needs deep down in our
[19:52] hearts.
[19:54] things that Lord maybe we can't
[19:58] talk about Lord but thou knowest oh God
[20:02] some things just seem impossible dear
[20:04] God but Lord we come to you that Lord
[20:09] give us that faith oh God the faith that
[20:12] will reach out and touch you oh Lord and
[20:16] bring life to our hearts oh God and
[20:19] bring life to our lives oh God the life
[20:23] of God and bring transformation Lord and
[20:27] bring victory oh God. Victory over
[20:31] unbelief.
[20:33] Victory over sin.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Victory over fear. Oh God that we
[20:39] believe you Lord and trust you.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; Lord you are a loving father. You love
[20:45] us Lord.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; And even when
[20:49] when we've done wrong you still love us
[20:52] father. So we come to you Lord. We are
[20:54] looking to you as a loving father.
[20:57] Oh God bless us with your presence.
[21:01] May your angels be around us this
[21:03] morning Lord.
[21:06] Come and walk around us father.
[21:09] Come and be with us Lord. We love you
[21:11] father. Oh may we experience your love
[21:14] in our hearts father in a way perhaps
[21:17] that we've never heard before. Dear God,
[21:20] just once more, dear God, as Samson
[21:23] called unto you and said, Lord, just
[21:26] this once, once more, Lord, come and be
[21:29] with us, Father.
[21:31] And Lord, we remember I believe is the
[21:33] sister with
[21:36] cancer. Lord,
[21:38] we we want to pray for her, dear God.
[21:43] That which is not possible with man is
[21:46] possible with you, Lord. We pray that in
[21:47] the name of Jesus, Lord, as we are
[21:49] gathered here, reaching out to you,
[21:52] may you reach out to her and give us
[21:54] faith, Lord.
[21:57] Faith to call on you, Lord. Faith that
[21:59] will bring you on the scene.
[22:01] And Lord, this very message that we
[22:03] believe, the voice that you used to
[22:06] preach this message, Lord,
[22:09] one of the things that this message was
[22:11] sent was to defeat cancer. Dear Lord, oh
[22:14] God,
[22:16] &gt;&gt; may you bring healing to this yesterday
[22:17] dear Lord.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; Grant it heavenly father.
[22:22] Lord God, we also want to pray for the
[22:25] offering father as we give
[22:28] Lord may it be blessed father
[22:31] and may it be used for your glory dear
[22:34] God. And Lord we pray for the minister
[22:36] will who is going to minister. Oh God,
[22:40] oh Lord, once more Lord,
[22:44] come through him and speak to us.
[22:45] Father, we love you, we adore you, we
[22:47] praise you, Lord, let your will be done.
[22:51] In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[22:55] [Music]
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother Gilbert. So
[23:04] brothers, take up the offering. Let's
[23:05] just sing. I am redeemed, bought with a
[23:08] price.

[27:57] men raise up and and catch a hold. And I
[28:01] just text Brother John. I said, "Keep
[28:02] that flag flying high. Preach the word
[28:05] of God in Edmonton. Preach the word with

[30:53] But God has told us in his word to pray
[30:56] and do our best. Amen. I don't think we

[31:04] and rejoice in the Lord and give God
[31:07] praise.
[31:10] Amen. We're living in perilous times.

[36:38] All pass away.
[36:44] [Music]
[37:00] [Applause]
[37:02] through your presence.
[37:06] I might
[37:08] [Music]
[37:28] Hallelujah. It's
[37:29] &gt;&gt; a wonderful testimony to be able to
[37:31] sing.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; And it's wonderful testimony to be able
[37:35] to confess, I'm amazed.
[37:37] While we're singing it, I just I a
[37:40] little phrase I say every once in a
[37:41] while to the Lord. How do you ever find
[37:43] me?
[37:45] How do you ever find this planet?
[37:48] when I see, you know,
[37:51] uh, the universe in perspective with all
[37:54] of God's creation, I just I have to
[37:57] believe because it doesn't make any
[38:00] sense to the human mind. Uh, when you
[38:03] think of the expanse of universes and on
[38:08] and on and on and then you hear a simple
[38:11] statement, God fil God fills all time
[38:13] and space.
[38:15] Wow,
[38:17] that's a a big statement. And but here
[38:20] he is. He fills this space.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; And we're here this morning
[38:26] uh to to go into the word. I'm just uh
[38:30] taking a little bit of hesitation here
[38:32] because I'm not too sure just how far
[38:35] we're going to go. And uh brother
[38:38] brother Tom said why don't you just
[38:39] carry right on and uh if I do we'll
[38:43] forget this afternoon service
[38:47] but we'll try not to do that do that
[38:49] because brother Tom is ready for
[38:51] tonight. We're happy uh I was driving
[38:54] here this morning. We're happy that uh
[38:57] that there's uh brother John Andes is in
[39:00] Edmonton at brother Harold uh Harold
[39:04] Hildibbran's request. We're happy. I I
[39:08] heard the announcement brother Tom
[39:10] saying brother Tim and sister Sarah and
[39:13] Philippines coming home Tuesday. Uh
[39:15] we're happy. You say why are you happy?
[39:18] I'm happy that the church is able to
[39:21] provide ministry.
[39:23] And I had a long call yesterday from
[39:26] brother Ruben Daniels in Johannesburg,
[39:30] South Africa. He pastors one of the
[39:33] churches there. The church used to be
[39:34] pastored by his elder brother Joseph
[39:36] Daniels. Brother Joseph Daniels has been
[39:39] here uh years ago and we're well
[39:42] acquainted with him. Uh brother Joseph
[39:44] Daniels now does some mission work out
[39:47] from the church throughout Africa. I
[39:49] understand. But brother Ruben, he said,
[39:52] "We stream the meetings and we been
[39:54] blessed by the ministry." And uh,
[39:56] Brother Deepac Titus and his wife,
[39:59] Sister Vandy from India, they have been
[40:01] emailing me back and forth. And then I
[40:04] received an email from their daughter,
[40:06] Shakina. But Shakina saved up her money
[40:08] and bought an iPad just for what express
[40:12] purpose that the family could stream the
[40:13] meetings and sit and watch them all
[40:16] together. And he said, "She sits in her
[40:17] room." He said, "She knows every person.
[40:20] and she knows every announcement. She
[40:22] knows everything that's going on and we
[40:24] hear every service.
[40:26] So, God bless you, brother Deepac,
[40:28] Sister Vandy, and Sister Shakina and her
[40:31] brother. Uh, God bless them. God bless
[40:34] the saints in Switzerland. God bless
[40:36] anybody that we can bless by having a
[40:38] service. and uh and uh uh the special
[40:43] reason that brother uh brother Murphy
[40:45] Wong went to Dallas at brother David
[40:49] McGary's request in fact is brother
[40:52] David McGary came up and had the
[40:54] memorial service for brother Ryan sister
[40:56] Shana's mother and uh and he was coming
[41:00] this way and Murphy was going that way.
[41:03] So I said to him I said I think brother
[41:04] Murphy's where you come from. He he
[41:07] said, "Yeah, I'm I'll be back there."
[41:10] Uh, and the reason he's there is because
[41:14] there was a Chinese man, an engineer,
[41:17] professional man that is very much
[41:20] connected to a movement and it's a vast
[41:23] movement of Christian
[41:26] uh movement amongst young people in
[41:29] schools etc etc and uh they got their
[41:33] own website etc. And then when brother
[41:36] McGary began to tell him about the
[41:38] message and the and a Bible, the Chinese
[41:42] translation of the Bible that brother
[41:43] Murphy has just completed and how it
[41:47] ties to the message. Then the last two
[41:50] weeks they've been coming to the church
[41:52] to hear more about this and brother
[41:56] David said he phoned right away and said
[41:58] if you can send brother Murphy down he
[42:01] said and preach for us for the weekend
[42:03] of services we'll arrange a dinner
[42:05] together with these people. And so
[42:07] that's what he's doing. He's he's going
[42:09] to be busy and we're all busy.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Busy for the kingdom.
[42:18] We want to also
[42:20] uh welcome our brother and sister
[42:22] Poacher from Montana. Where are you?
[42:25] You're here in the There you are right
[42:27] there, Brother Shannon and Sister
[42:28] Angela. God bless you and your children
[42:31] are at home, but you're here and we're
[42:33] thankful that you're here. Amen.
[42:38] Well, I didn't want to keep you
[42:39] standing, but uh uh I wonder if we could
[42:43] sing Have You Been to the Fountain?
[42:46] Take the microphone there.
[42:58] Have you been
[43:02] beneath the mountain?
[43:07] There's no way
[43:12] to go.
[43:15] Oh,
[43:23] it will
[43:25] [Music]
[43:28] Oh,
[43:31] have you
[43:36] found
[43:40] [Music]
[43:52] me?
[43:54] He will watch
[43:57] you.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; And before we just before we turn to the
[44:04] word, we want to we're going to have
[44:06] prayer and uh uh we'll just remain here,
[44:10] brother. We're going to have prayer for
[44:11] uh Sister Amanda Drake's father. Brother
[44:15] Ben and I spoke last night. Sister
[44:17] Amanda's very burdenful father. But he's
[44:20] in the hospital right at this moment as
[44:22] I speak. And they're giving him tests
[44:24] and so on. He's got all kinds of
[44:26] multiple problems, not able to actually
[44:29] walk or move around and just a whole lot
[44:32] of things.
[44:34] They need God.
[44:36] They need the healer to come in. They
[44:39] need somebody that can stabilize this
[44:41] situation. And also they need medical
[44:44] people who will have a heart of
[44:47] compassion and understand you know you
[44:50] that have been into hospitals and
[44:52] whatever medical clinics and so on. It's
[44:54] so easy just to become a statistic just
[44:57] a number. You're just a number but we
[44:59] need to be we need to have people that
[45:01] will be concerned and have more than a
[45:03] number. And uh so we're going to pray
[45:06] that for uh this family just now I I I
[45:10] and ask for ourselves. I wonder if you
[45:12] would pray that God will give you I've
[45:14] been praying that God will help me speak
[45:17] and now I wonder if you would pray that
[45:19] God will help you to understand what it
[45:22] is that you know I seek to. And I'll
[45:25] tell you quite frankly I came to the uh
[45:28] came to the church this morning and I
[45:29] thought you know it's almost unfair.
[45:31] It's hard minister studies for a long
[45:34] time sometimes 2 3 weeks and uh and and
[45:40] uh the Holy Spirit just waiting on God
[45:42] the Holy Spirit and then we come to uh
[45:46] the church and we expect him to unload
[45:49] it in an hour and a half or two and uh
[45:52] and and make it all clear. It's hard to
[45:54] get out what's been burning for a couple
[45:58] of weeks. So I that's why I say pray for
[46:01] yourself also. I will pray and have
[46:04] prayed and you pray where I just like to
[46:07] pray for sister Amanda Drake's father.
[46:10] His name is brother Dick and his wife's
[46:13] name is Sister Emily. Heavenly Father,
[46:17] as we stand as a group of people here
[46:19] this morning, we stand here testifying,
[46:24] giving evidence by our presence here. We
[46:27] believe in you. We believe there's only
[46:30] one God. We believe that that God is the
[46:33] eternal one making himself known and
[46:36] hath manifested himself in Jesus Christ
[46:39] has paid the price, the full price for
[46:41] our redemption. And the blood has been
[46:44] shed and we are washed in the blood of
[46:46] the lamb. We've been cleansed, oh God,
[46:50] pure and holy. And there is no other
[46:52] antidote for sin. We're thankful for
[46:55] that. And when Jesus said, "It is
[46:58] finished," then he had paid it all. And
[47:00] we are, he is a God that heals us. We
[47:03] pray that you'll send your virtue right
[47:05] now, the per virtue of the resurrected
[47:07] Christ to our brother Dick, oh God.
[47:10] Raise him up, Father. And I pray you'll
[47:13] put a heart within him to do what is
[47:16] correct with his own body and with his
[47:18] own health. I pray, Father, you'll give
[47:21] the people their wisdom. give the
[47:23] caretakers uh some compassion, oh God.
[47:26] Not that they don't have it, but I pray
[47:28] you'll give extra compassion. And I pray
[47:31] you'll give the doctor concern, Father,
[47:33] that they might determine just what is
[47:36] needed for our brother. And Lord, let
[47:38] him let his body respond. Let the cells
[47:42] respond. I pray we need not only human
[47:46] effort, we need the God, the God factor.
[47:50] We pray, oh God, the living God, the God
[47:53] of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of
[47:56] the apostles and the God and father, our
[47:58] Lord Jesus Christ, the God of Moses and
[48:01] Elijah, the God of our precious prophet
[48:04] William Brandham. And this time, we saw
[48:06] you on display, oh God. We have been uh
[48:09] we've been exposed to it and we believe
[48:12] in you. You are the almighty one. And
[48:16] now Lord I pray that you'll give uh
[48:18] strength and courage and ability to
[48:21] myself as I stand here. I pray you'll
[48:23] give uh uh illumination and revelation
[48:26] to the people as they listen. And uh I
[48:30] pray father that you'll give us alert
[48:32] minds in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen
[48:35] and amen.
[48:37] I want to sing take your burden to the
[48:40] place of prayer.
[48:42] know that. How do I leave the burden of
[48:45] care? You don't know it. Well, I won't
[48:47] sing a solo.
[48:50] How many know that? Take your burden to
[48:52] the place of prayer. My wife knows it.
[48:54] My goodness, I didn't think it was that
[48:57] far back.
[48:59] Fact is, it's not.
[49:03] All right.
[49:05] Take your burden to the place of prayer,
[49:09] dear L. and care for you have it and
[49:14] provides our every need. Take your
[49:16] burden.
[49:18] You don't know that.
[49:21] I thought Brother Hibbran knew every
[49:23] song in the book and a bunch I don't
[49:24] even know. All right. Well, we won't we
[49:27] won't uh we won't tackle it. Thank you.
[49:30] God bless you.
[49:33] Have you open your Bibles
[49:35] and if you have a pen or pencil, you
[49:38] might want to just keep it handy. Find a
[49:41] little piece of paper. If you young
[49:43] people have a have a question, you
[49:45] should have some when I've finished
[49:48] today and just jot it down. Uh Lord
[49:53] willing, I'll either carry on with this
[49:56] or come back to it as soon as possible.
[50:00] I want to speak on the king of kings
[50:04] and I'm going to read from a number of
[50:06] scriptures starting uh with 1 Timothy
[50:10] 6:15.
[50:15] I'm only going to read one verse and
[50:16] then I will read one verse which is
[50:18] Revelation 17 and 14
[50:24] and then I'll begin reading four verses
[50:27] uh in Joshua 12.
[50:32] Sorry to take you around in the Bible
[50:34] but we'll need to because there's a
[50:37] continuity here that I would like to get
[50:40] from these scriptures.
[50:44] All right. Reading from 1 Timothy 6:15.
[50:51] Which in his times
[50:54] he shall show who is the blessed and
[50:56] only potentate,
[50:58] the king of kings and the lord of lords.
[51:03] Perhaps we can read it together. which
[51:06] in his times he shall show who is the
[51:10] blessed and only potentate the king of
[51:13] kings and the lord of lords. Amen.
[51:18] Revelation 17 and 14.
[51:38] These shall make war with the Lamb, and
[51:42] the Lamb shall overcome them.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. For he is lord of lords and king
[51:49] of kings. And they that are with him are
[51:52] called and chosen and faithful.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we can all say amen to
[51:59] that.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; I love that. These shall make war with
[52:03] the lamb and the lamb shall overcome
[52:06] them.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; End of subject. And he is for he is the
[52:10] lord of lords and king of kings and they
[52:13] that are with him are called and chosen
[52:17] and faithful there. He's not alone. Now
[52:21] please turn to Joshua the 12th chapter
[52:25] and you can keep your Bible open there
[52:27] after we have read these four verses.
[52:29] I'm going to read verse one and then
[52:31] verses 6 to8.
[52:35] Now these are the kings of the land
[52:38] which the children of Israel smokeote
[52:40] and possessed their land on the other
[52:43] side of Jordan toward the rising of the
[52:45] sun from the river Arnon unto Mount
[52:49] Hermon and all the plain of the east.
[52:54] Verse six,
[52:57] then did Moses and the servant of the
[52:59] Lord and the children of Israel smite.
[53:02] And Moses and the servant of the Lord
[53:04] gave it for a possession unto the
[53:07] Reubenites and the Gadites
[53:10] and half the tribe of Manasseh. That was
[53:12] two and a half tribes.
[53:15] And these verse 7 and these are the
[53:18] kings of the country which Joshua and
[53:21] the children of Israel smokeote on this
[53:24] side Jordan on the west from Baalgad in
[53:29] the valley of Lebanon even unto the
[53:32] mount Hak uh that goeth up to Sir which
[53:37] Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel
[53:40] for a possession according to their
[53:42] divisions.
[53:46] How many have ever heard
[53:49] uh the voice of Winston Churchill
[53:52] when he took control of the
[53:56] uh very very dim and dark situation in
[54:01] Britain during the Second World War and
[54:04] London itself was being demolished with
[54:07] V2 rockets coming over from Germany and
[54:11] so on And the people were running into
[54:14] their bomb shelters and Winston Church
[54:17] Hill stood up and he said, "We will
[54:19] fight here and we will fight there and
[54:22] we will be in the valleys and we'll be
[54:24] in whatever." How many of her ever heard
[54:26] him speak that? Yes, a few of you. Well,
[54:30] I thought I thought of him uh when I
[54:33] hear this about Joshua and verse eight.
[54:36] Uh and they he divided the the land for
[54:40] possession according to the divisions.
[54:41] He said, "In the mountains and in the
[54:44] valleys and in the plains and in the
[54:47] springs and in the wilderness and in the
[54:50] south country, the Hittites, the
[54:53] Amorites and the Canaanites, the
[54:56] Perizzites, the Hivites and the
[54:58] Jebusites." He included them all. And
[55:00] that pretty well
[55:03] describes the spirit of Joshua. He
[55:05] wasn't just going to go one place. He
[55:07] said, "Wherever they are and wherever
[55:10] wherever we find it and uh it will apply
[55:14] coming home to your address this
[55:16] morning." And thank you for standing.
[55:17] You may be seated. Keep your Bible open
[55:20] if you would
[55:23] in in chapter 11 23.
[55:29] Sometime we lose people when we uh go
[55:32] around like this, but I don't expect I
[55:34] will lose you at all. You'll keep your
[55:36] thought. And Joshua
[55:39] 11 23. And Joshua took the whole land
[55:43] according to all that the Lord said unto
[55:46] Moses. And Joshua gave it for an
[55:49] inheritance unto Israel, according to
[55:52] their divisions by their tribes, and the
[55:56] land rested from war.
[56:01] He said one place at the very end of the
[56:03] his book and Joshua. So Joshua let the
[56:06] people depart every man unto his
[56:08] inheritance.
[56:11] All right. You may look this way. Now
[56:13] God bless the word to you
[56:15] in the 12th chapter which we just read a
[56:19] few four verses of.
[56:21] Uh the 12th chapter gives the names of
[56:24] many kings. I'm speaking on the king of
[56:27] kings, but Joshua names, the book of
[56:30] Joshua names many kings that were living
[56:33] in the land that God gave as an
[56:37] inheritance to the children of Israel. I
[56:40] need to make something very clear to you
[56:43] as a foundation plank to the service
[56:46] this morning.
[56:49] when a lot of people read and a lot of
[56:51] believers even read or Christians read
[56:54] uh the the the
[56:56] how God dispossessed the people or the
[56:59] children of Israel dispossessed the
[57:00] people and it it it's it's a little
[57:04] maybe a little difficult for some to
[57:06] read if you become emotionally attached.
[57:08] They smoked them. They left none that
[57:10] breathed living. and say, "Oh my," you
[57:14] know, uh we have to remember one thing.
[57:19] God is the creator who created the earth
[57:24] and the Bible says the earth is the
[57:27] Lord's.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Do we accept that?
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; The earth is the Lord's.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; It belongs at it says he by him were all
[57:35] things created that are in heaven that
[57:38] are in earth. All things were made by
[57:39] him and without him was nothing made.
[57:41] that is made speaking of Christ because
[57:44] that was the creative power of God and
[57:46] belongs to God. The fact that other
[57:49] people were living there that's that's a
[57:51] side issue. That is a side issue that
[57:54] would not be uh perhaps uh you know
[57:58] within the understanding of our modern
[58:01] age where we want to be understanding
[58:04] and we want to be uh accepting of all
[58:08] situations and all people and wherever
[58:10] they are and whatever and and I think
[58:12] that we should but on the other hand
[58:15] when we read in the word of God and you
[58:17] when you read in the word of God you
[58:20] want to agree with that that your father
[58:22] speaking.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; And when it says that the Lord the uh
[58:27] the the the earth is the Lord's, then we
[58:30] want to say amen. The earth is the
[58:33] Lord's and the owner can do whatever he
[58:36] wishes. Now, we're speaking about an an
[58:40] inheritance
[58:42] in in order to inherit uh you have to be
[58:46] a blood relative. I I just had an
[58:50] experience in the last over the last few
[58:53] months as I was left an executive of an
[58:56] estate of my aunt and uh there was a big
[59:00] family and at the end she just decided
[59:03] to just divide what remained of her
[59:06] estate into even shares of all the
[59:10] family and uh uh her siblings etc. And
[59:14] if the siblings were not living, then it
[59:17] would be to their children and and so
[59:19] on. Ended up being about 32
[59:23] or 33 beneficiaries.
[59:26] And I had to find all of them. And some
[59:29] of them she didn't know if they were
[59:31] living or not.
[59:34] And so I had one experience which I'll
[59:37] just relate to you. There was a
[59:40] question. I had an aunt that died a
[59:44] tragic and unexpected death and left two
[59:47] children, which was a baby in arms and
[59:51] uh a a boy. I didn't ever never heard of
[59:55] him. Never heard of him. Up in my years
[59:59] now, I I never knew that this young baby
[1:00:03] had a brother. And they said yes. And I
[1:00:07] think that he went to Ontario or
[1:00:09] something. and everybody
[1:00:12] uh nobody knows anything. So I have to
[1:00:15] go on a search.
[1:00:18] So I was searching the internet,
[1:00:19] searching the internet and I found a man
[1:00:21] by that name. And there's lots of them.
[1:00:23] It's not a simple name. And there's some
[1:00:25] of them in the United States and some a
[1:00:28] few in Canada. And I found one by the
[1:00:31] first name. It went by the uh first name
[1:00:34] and his last name was together. And I I
[1:00:36] I found where he had passed away. He had
[1:00:39] died in 2003.
[1:00:42] So I read the orbituary and I I heard
[1:00:45] about his wife and his family and as I
[1:00:48] read about the wife, I was very suspect
[1:00:50] that it was even his wife and I didn't
[1:00:52] know and so on and so forth. And I saw
[1:00:55] the names of two daughters and a son. So
[1:00:58] I I called I called information to get
[1:01:02] the number of the one daughter and I'm
[1:01:04] making a point now that refers directly
[1:01:07] to you and uh so I I phoned and one one
[1:01:12] day I got an answer and it was a girl
[1:01:15] sounded like about 15year-old teenager
[1:01:18] and I said is is your mother there now
[1:01:21] she doesn't go by the father's name she
[1:01:22] goes by her married name is your is your
[1:01:25] is your mother there she said, "No,
[1:01:28] she'll be back in an hour or two." I
[1:01:29] called back and I got the lady on the
[1:01:33] phone.
[1:01:35] And I said, "Now they have a total
[1:01:38] stranger calling. They're already very,
[1:01:40] very suspicious." I said, "Excuse me." I
[1:01:44] said, "Uh, I gave her my name." I said,
[1:01:47] "There's a a good possibility that your
[1:01:50] father and I are cousins."
[1:01:53] And I said, uh,
[1:01:56] I have been left as executive of an
[1:01:59] estate that your father is named in. And
[1:02:03] being that he has passed away,
[1:02:06] if you are, if he indeed is my cousin,
[1:02:10] then you will participate in this
[1:02:13] inheritance.
[1:02:15] And uh, she's just listening. It's all
[1:02:17] quiet. I said, "Your father passed away
[1:02:21] in 2003." She said, "That's correct." I
[1:02:25] said, "Your father was born in 1935 in
[1:02:28] Walka, Saskatchewan." She said, "That is
[1:02:32] correct." I said, "I was born in Walka,
[1:02:35] Saskatchewan in 1934,
[1:02:38] and that gives me reason to believe that
[1:02:41] perhaps he and I are cousins." I said,
[1:02:45] uh,
[1:02:47] I need to know, uh, excuse me for
[1:02:50] asking, but I said, I need to know how
[1:02:52] did he get to Eastern Canada to Ontario.
[1:02:58] And she said, I believe I'll have to
[1:02:59] speak with my sister. I said, all right,
[1:03:03] and we'll call you back. Well, I they
[1:03:05] didn't call back. I didn't hear.
[1:03:08] And so then I tried another
[1:03:11] avenue and I tried another avenue which
[1:03:16] was the wife, the mother of these
[1:03:18] children who was not part of the
[1:03:21] inheritance. And I called her and uh I I
[1:03:26] said there's a possibility that I and
[1:03:28] your husband were cousins. Oh, she was
[1:03:32] so she was just an open very happy
[1:03:36] person. And I said, uh, she said he'd be
[1:03:39] so happy to know one of his cousins was
[1:03:41] trying to contact him. And I said, well,
[1:03:45] uh, I have to ask you a couple of
[1:03:48] questions that are personal. And I said,
[1:03:50] I and I gave her the same account, and I
[1:03:54] had not planned to give you these
[1:03:55] details, but it will it will impress you
[1:03:57] with what I'm wanting to convey. And I
[1:04:00] said, uh, I need to know that that your
[1:04:05] children are blood
[1:04:08] re relatives
[1:04:10] of of my aunt that has passed away.
[1:04:15] That's the only connection.
[1:04:17] Blood relative is everything. If you are
[1:04:21] not a blood relative
[1:04:24] of the one who authored this Bible,
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; you're in the wrong place.
[1:04:31] If you're a blood relative, everything
[1:04:33] in here belongs to you.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; If you're a blood relative, the service
[1:04:38] this morning is for you.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; You've got to know that you're a blood
[1:04:42] relative. That I am a son of God.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; I came out of God.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; I am a daughter of God. I have his I
[1:04:52] have his very seed in me. He spoke it
[1:04:55] and it's it is more powerful seed than
[1:04:58] the seed that brought this body here to
[1:05:00] sit in this seat. Do you believe that?
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; You have to believe that. Do you believe
[1:05:05] that up in the balconies?
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; You have to believe that. You have to
[1:05:09] know that
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; this is not just an enthusiasm. This is
[1:05:13] not just something. This is not just
[1:05:15] some doctrine. This is not some church.
[1:05:18] You have to know that you are born again
[1:05:21] by the spirit of the word of God. And if
[1:05:24] you know that, everything here is yours.
[1:05:27] Everything we have to speak about this
[1:05:29] morning is for you. And that's what I
[1:05:31] need to establish.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; My aunt that passed away tragically, her
[1:05:37] name was Josephine.
[1:05:39] And no one speaks about it. There's a
[1:05:42] difference of opinion about how she
[1:05:44] passed away. It was a tragic death.
[1:05:49] And uh
[1:05:52] I haven't heard hardly anybody use her
[1:05:54] name.
[1:05:56] So I said to this woman, I said
[1:06:00] uh your husband was born at a certain
[1:06:04] date and I was born a year earlier.
[1:06:07] And uh I said uh
[1:06:12] what was his mother's name?
[1:06:15] And the phone was silent.
[1:06:18] She said, "Josephine."
[1:06:20] I said, "Thank you.
[1:06:23] One more personal question.
[1:06:25] Are these three children
[1:06:28] are they from your husband?" She said,
[1:06:31] "I certainly hope so."
[1:06:34] I said, "Well, thank you. That's what I
[1:06:37] have to establish." So now I had blood
[1:06:40] relatives
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; who participated
[1:06:43] in the inheritance and that's that was
[1:06:46] the key. There's no other key friends.
[1:06:50] We are blood relatives.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; This is not figment of the imagination.
[1:06:55] This is not something you sign in a
[1:06:57] church book. This is not something that
[1:07:00] somebody conjures up in their mind. This
[1:07:03] is what the word of God says. And it
[1:07:05] says, "And if sons, then we're hes."
[1:07:09] [Applause]
[1:07:10] [Music]
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; And if you're children of God, then
[1:07:15] you're joint hes with Jesus Christ.
[1:07:18] That's the connection. Hallelujah.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; In this case, I was the connection. I
[1:07:24] was the one left with the
[1:07:25] responsibility. But there had to be a
[1:07:27] testator. And the one who created the
[1:07:30] ground that we're on is the testator. He
[1:07:34] declares, "I'm the owner.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; I created the earth. In the beginning,
[1:07:39] God created the heavens and the earth."
[1:07:42] That's a tutony, the end of subject. Do
[1:07:45] you believe that?
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God created the
[1:07:49] heavens and the earth. And the scripture
[1:07:51] says all things and the prophet comes
[1:07:53] and says, "Out of the bosom of God." And
[1:07:55] Jesus and Jesus has declared in the
[1:07:57] scripture that he came out from God and
[1:08:00] goes back to God because there's only
[1:08:03] one God. And and and the father of the
[1:08:06] father gave the son which the world is
[1:08:09] remembering now. And they know very
[1:08:10] little about Christmas. This isn't even
[1:08:14] the season that the lamb was born in. We
[1:08:17] know that. But we're we commemorate he
[1:08:19] did come.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; We're thankful that he came. But I want
[1:08:23] you to know that the King of Kings is
[1:08:26] here.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The King of Kings. And if
[1:08:30] you are a blood relative, you have to
[1:08:32] know you're a blood relative
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; of this King.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I want to shake you down
[1:08:41] to you contemplate these things. This is
[1:08:44] what the subject is all about. And so
[1:08:46] Joshua gives the names of a whole lot of
[1:08:49] kings.
[1:08:52] 31.
[1:08:57] But they're opposed.
[1:09:00] They're all opposed to the children of
[1:09:03] God.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Coming into a land that God, the
[1:09:08] testator, the author, the one who had to
[1:09:12] die to make the will good.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; And he couldn't die because God can't
[1:09:16] die.
[1:09:19] So he sends his son.
[1:09:22] He creates with the same word seed that
[1:09:26] brought you here. He creates a seed. And
[1:09:30] the prophet of God says, "And that word,
[1:09:32] the word of the prophets, are you
[1:09:34] following me closely?" I'm not. This is
[1:09:37] not some poetic license. Now, the word
[1:09:39] of the prophets lodged in the womb of
[1:09:43] Mary,
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; and the and the and the angel of the
[1:09:46] Lord said, "The Holy Spirit shall
[1:09:48] overshadow you, and you shall conceive."
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; How will this be? I know not a man. The
[1:09:55] Holy Ghost will overshadow you. And I
[1:09:58] can tell you, if you've had a birth that
[1:10:00] makes you a son or daughter of God, the
[1:10:02] same Holy Ghost had to overshadow you at
[1:10:05] some point in time, at some place. And
[1:10:08] if you haven't experienced it, may this
[1:10:11] be the time and may this be the place.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That the Holy Spirit
[1:10:17] overshadows you and you experience a
[1:10:19] birth. It is an inward work. I don't
[1:10:22] care if you're at the altar. I don't
[1:10:23] care whether you weep or cry or whatever
[1:10:26] more, but as long as you have a birth
[1:10:28] and you know that you had a birth,
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; you know, sometimes a preacher preaches
[1:10:38] and you wonder if it's a reality.
[1:10:41] And I
[1:10:43] I trust that this won't be too personal,
[1:10:47] but we have brother and sister sitting
[1:10:49] here.
[1:10:53] Brother Poacher was sitting in a camp
[1:10:55] meeting. Is that all right, brother
[1:10:57] Shannon? Brother,
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; he was sitting in a camp meeting,
[1:11:03] a Bible way camp meeting out at Mount
[1:11:06] Baker camp.
[1:11:09] Sitting there,
[1:11:11] we had spoken together. I had not met
[1:11:14] the man before that I knew maybe shook
[1:11:16] hands. He's sitting here as a witness.
[1:11:19] his wife is sitting beside him
[1:11:22] and he said uh
[1:11:26] he said I I I have such a desire to be
[1:11:30] here
[1:11:32] but he said uh you know in Montana
[1:11:37] we have I think 20 acres of land and
[1:11:41] some acreage of land and we have horses
[1:11:43] and we have cows we have dogs we got
[1:11:48] some lakes on the property and and uh
[1:11:51] just finished a nice log home and we're
[1:11:55] all settled there, you know, and I have
[1:11:56] three children and we love the place.
[1:12:00] He may not remember, but I said, "You
[1:12:02] have a mini millennium
[1:12:06] and we can't have a millennium down
[1:12:08] here."
[1:12:12] But he said, uh, I, you know, he just
[1:12:15] felt, I could feel from the conversation
[1:12:18] that there was something that needed to
[1:12:19] happen.
[1:12:21] While he sat and listened to Brother
[1:12:23] Craig Boore preach,
[1:12:25] he said, "The Holy Spirit
[1:12:28] fell on me and something happened and I
[1:12:33] was changed."
[1:12:35] And when he went home, Sister Angel, I
[1:12:38] believe the testimony is true. You saw
[1:12:40] there was a change
[1:12:43] and uh and they came and visited here
[1:12:48] and just standing out here in front of
[1:12:50] the in front of the doors.
[1:12:52] I just was talking to someone. They had
[1:12:54] me engaged in a conversation. I said,
[1:12:56] "Excuse me, I have to go over and shake
[1:12:57] hands with uh these people." And I
[1:13:00] especially wanted to shake hands with
[1:13:02] Sister Angela. And I had heard from
[1:13:05] brother Matthew Redell that her mother
[1:13:07] lives in Canada,
[1:13:10] lives in Vancouver some area. So I I
[1:13:12] just said to her, I said, "I understand
[1:13:14] your mother's in Canada." She said, "No,
[1:13:16] actually my mother's living in Langley."
[1:13:19] And she said,
[1:13:22] and she listened to your radio broadcast
[1:13:25] and you sent her tapes. We sent out
[1:13:28] tapes to brother Venoms and you sent her
[1:13:30] tapes and then you sent her a church age
[1:13:34] book. I read the church age book and
[1:13:37] became a believer.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; There she sits right there. Would you
[1:13:41] stand up, Sister Angela?
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Shannon.
[1:13:46] That's their testimony.
[1:13:51] You know, it's it's like we kind of are
[1:13:53] looking somewhere into some foggy misty
[1:13:57] place for some kind of miracle. It's
[1:13:59] sitting all around you.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; We're all miracles. Any man, woman born
[1:14:04] of the spirit of God is a mere divine
[1:14:07] miracle from God.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Are you miracles?
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; And Joshua lists all of these kings. I
[1:14:18] thought kings.
[1:14:21] Now you have to go with me. These kings,
[1:14:26] they were born in this world and had a
[1:14:29] natural birth as Joshua did.
[1:14:33] It was predestinated that they should be
[1:14:36] born at this time because they had to be
[1:14:38] in a position of authority. They were
[1:14:41] kings over cities, kings over areas.
[1:14:45] And they had grown up and birthed and
[1:14:49] planted vineyards and walled cities and
[1:14:54] lived and had their families and
[1:14:56] everything else and now are about to be
[1:14:58] dispossessed.
[1:15:00] And how they acquired the land, I do not
[1:15:03] know, but it was their land. And it just
[1:15:05] so happened also while those young
[1:15:10] people grew in the young men grew into
[1:15:13] kings who were respected. I thought they
[1:15:16] had to have certain character. They had
[1:15:19] to have certain leadership qualities.
[1:15:22] They had certain skills. They had
[1:15:25] certain demeanor about them that made
[1:15:28] made them to be kings and respected as
[1:15:31] kings. and they had a certain character
[1:15:35] that uh uh was not going to give in to
[1:15:39] uh people coming in claiming the land.
[1:15:42] And so some of them in some cases they
[1:15:45] heard of Joshua's victories. They heard
[1:15:49] what had happened to King Sihon by by
[1:15:53] Moses and when and and and and Joshua.
[1:15:57] They heard what happened to King Og and
[1:16:00] those two those two kings which control
[1:16:04] part of the land that was on the border
[1:16:06] of the promised land. And they wanted
[1:16:09] just to cross a go across their area.
[1:16:12] And God God had told the children of
[1:16:15] Israel, "Don't disturb Moab." Brother
[1:16:18] Brandham tells it in as I was with
[1:16:20] Moses. He said, "Don't disturb Mo Moab."
[1:16:23] And brother Brandham picks it right up.
[1:16:25] In fact is I don't know if I've achieved
[1:16:27] this myself personally, but he says, you
[1:16:30] know, don't distress them. the there if
[1:16:34] they're borderline believers, which they
[1:16:36] may be just on the border of the
[1:16:38] inheritance, they don't have the call
[1:16:40] and is not predestinated to go in. He
[1:16:43] said, "Esau, Edom, Esau's children,
[1:16:46] they're right on the border. Don't
[1:16:48] distress them. Don't try to make life
[1:16:51] miserable for them. Don't don't
[1:16:53] determine." He said, "God gave them
[1:16:55] that. That's as far as they can see, and
[1:16:58] we just leave that." And they said,
[1:17:00] "We'll just walk softly past your past
[1:17:03] your territory, and if our people take
[1:17:06] anything, we'll pay you for it, and we
[1:17:08] won't disturb anything." And the kings,
[1:17:10] but there was something in those kings
[1:17:12] who were born and raised and came to
[1:17:14] maturity and came to kingship at that
[1:17:16] time. And they said, "No, we'll not do
[1:17:18] it." That was their decision, and that
[1:17:20] was their fate.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; And so then you read, "Bring them here.
[1:17:27] going to destroy them because we're This
[1:17:30] is part of the This is part of the
[1:17:32] inheritance.
[1:17:34] This is part of the inheritance. I got
[1:17:36] my blood. I got my blood children down
[1:17:39] there.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; They're born.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; They're born of my word,
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Are you following me thus far? All
[1:17:46] right.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; And each of these kings were born at a
[1:17:51] certain time in history,
[1:17:54] ruling at a certain time that God is
[1:17:58] sending at the same time that God was
[1:17:59] sending Joshua to divide this land as an
[1:18:03] inheritance for his children. You have
[1:18:05] to hang on to this long foundation now
[1:18:07] because I'm going to come right home to
[1:18:09] your address and you'll smile at it in
[1:18:12] some cases. Each king born with a
[1:18:15] certain character,
[1:18:17] abilities and qualities that made them
[1:18:20] eligible to become a sovereign, a king.
[1:18:24] And many times in the Bible, you'll find
[1:18:26] the reference kings of the earth. Kings
[1:18:29] of the earth. The kings of the earth.
[1:18:32] And don't go quickly through the Bible,
[1:18:35] but that's what they were, kings of the
[1:18:37] earth. But I'm speaking about the king
[1:18:40] of kings.
[1:18:42] That's right.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; And that's a different terminology.
[1:18:44] That's a different person.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; And I'm talking about the King of Kings
[1:18:49] children.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; And their nature and attitude to Joshua.
[1:18:57] Joshua was Jehovah's Savior,
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; taking his people in
[1:19:03] is reflective of the spirits that oppose
[1:19:06] us today. There's my key phrase. They
[1:19:10] are reflective of the spirits that
[1:19:14] oppose you
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; today.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; And everyone Joshua didn't go in and
[1:19:22] fight alone. Says the people with him,
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; the people with him. And in Revelation
[1:19:28] says, you know, the king of kings and
[1:19:31] the and those that are with him
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; elected and called. Friends, you have to
[1:19:37] place yourself there. You're going to
[1:19:39] have a victory. You have to place
[1:19:41] yourself there. I'm starting from your
[1:19:43] origin where you came from. Say, "Well,
[1:19:46] I come from Canada. I come from United
[1:19:48] States. I come from England or Europe or
[1:19:50] wherever more. I come from Russia. I
[1:19:52] come from Africa." That's not the point.
[1:19:55] And that's not important at this time.
[1:19:58] Not for this subject is not important in
[1:20:01] relationship to the King of Kings. Him
[1:20:04] that rode on a horse. him that John saw.
[1:20:08] I I can tell you all through the
[1:20:10] scripture this that it's going to be
[1:20:12] hard for me to complete the the message,
[1:20:15] but I want to give enough of it to you
[1:20:17] that you will begin to see yourself in
[1:20:20] the picture.
[1:20:26] Now, brother Brandham in the message,
[1:20:28] the angel of the Lord,
[1:20:32] uh,
[1:20:33] and just before I say this,
[1:20:36] if these kings of the Old Testament that
[1:20:41] withtood the people from going on to
[1:20:43] their inheritance,
[1:20:45] if they are reflective or if they if
[1:20:49] they, you know, are reflective or if
[1:20:51] they are representative
[1:20:54] of a spiritual warfare today, day then
[1:20:58] uh we we are engaged. I want to identify
[1:21:01] some of that a little bit
[1:21:04] and they had to uh they had to do a
[1:21:07] couple of things. Number one, they had
[1:21:08] to and you will have to do this this
[1:21:11] morning. You're not you didn't just come
[1:21:12] here to church. I come here now to
[1:21:14] challenge you.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; You have to identify
[1:21:18] you have to identify your personal enemy
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; if you have one.
[1:21:26] And you must be courageous
[1:21:29] to destroy it entirely.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; The record of Joshua, Jehovah's savior,
[1:21:39] leading the people into their
[1:21:41] inheritance, they had to identify who
[1:21:44] that leader was.
[1:21:46] You have to know that this is not just a
[1:21:49] message.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; You have to know that there's a leader,
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; right? You have to know who that leader
[1:21:56] is. You might say, "Well, it's God."
[1:21:58] Sorry, not good enough. You have to
[1:22:01] identify who is that God.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; What does that God say?
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Who is that God? How do you identify
[1:22:08] him? Who is this person? Say, "Well, I
[1:22:12] wept." All kinds of people weep. I was
[1:22:14] sorry. All kinds of people are sorry.
[1:22:17] Uh, I was at an altar. Millions come to
[1:22:20] the altar. say, "Well, how can I know
[1:22:23] that God, that God of eternity is a God
[1:22:27] that can make himself known? He's a God
[1:22:30] that can manifest himself. He's a God
[1:22:33] that can come from another dimension,
[1:22:35] from another realm, shall we call it,
[1:22:37] whether it be a pillar of fire or
[1:22:39] whatever kind of verbal description, but
[1:22:41] it's a God that makes himself known."
[1:22:44] And and how he makes himself known is by
[1:22:46] as he did with the prophets. He he
[1:22:48] declared himself by doing supernatural
[1:22:52] things before the people
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; and you have to identify that who is
[1:22:57] that
[1:22:59] are are the supernatural things being
[1:23:01] identified by those who maybe rise up
[1:23:04] against the message for example have all
[1:23:06] kinds of question where is the
[1:23:08] supernatural vindication? Where's the
[1:23:11] supernatural evidence that they speak on
[1:23:13] behalf of God or or anything else that
[1:23:17] I'm going to come to a lot of things
[1:23:18] that are in the world that you presently
[1:23:20] and I'm going to give them kings names.
[1:23:23] I'm going to change the names of these
[1:23:25] kings. I'm going to also give you the
[1:23:28] meaning of a bunch of these kings
[1:23:30] because and how they refer to the very
[1:23:33] world that we live in to show that as
[1:23:36] the prophet of God has said and this is
[1:23:38] what he said. I believe that all the
[1:23:41] things, all of the old things was a type
[1:23:45] of the new to come.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; What Israel was in the natural, we are
[1:23:51] in the spiritual.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to say, we are in the
[1:23:56] spiritual.
[1:23:58] Please with me. We are in the spiritual.
[1:24:02] God leading Israel naturally was what he
[1:24:05] was doing for us spiritually today.
[1:24:08] We're all very familiar with the
[1:24:11] scripture that I've just read and I and
[1:24:13] we're going to try to set forth. He said
[1:24:16] tonight God preparing for the journey,
[1:24:19] God setting his church in order. Then
[1:24:22] God's exodus of the church, taking it
[1:24:25] out. God's journey with the people in
[1:24:27] the wilderness. And then the last call
[1:24:30] where Joshua takes the children to
[1:24:33] Israel. Uh the children of Israel rather
[1:24:36] over into the promised land. And then
[1:24:39] the message God talked to Moses. He said
[1:24:41] the Jewish church was brought out of
[1:24:43] Egypt to Palestine was the natural
[1:24:46] church. God's natural people. God's
[1:24:50] natural people. Are you listening? God's
[1:24:54] natural people.
[1:24:57] But we today
[1:25:00] underlined
[1:25:03] bold and I've put it in highlight. But
[1:25:07] we today
[1:25:09] are God's spiritual church
[1:25:12] with a spiritual law written on the
[1:25:15] tables of our hearts led in a spiritual
[1:25:20] form. That's what I seat this morning.
[1:25:24] And behind this pulpit, the other
[1:25:26] ministers that minister are sent of God
[1:25:29] to lead a people.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, this is this is the
[1:25:34] whole purpose. We're not here to have a
[1:25:37] church. We're not here this churches all
[1:25:39] over in every corner. We're here to have
[1:25:42] uh to to to first to give evidence that
[1:25:45] there is a people that there has been a
[1:25:47] a voice of God that has sounded out and
[1:25:51] said, "I've heard that sound. I've heard
[1:25:54] that sound and I have responded to that
[1:25:56] sound. Now, I'm telling you that you're
[1:25:59] eligible to go in as an inheritance to
[1:26:03] to inherit and and perhaps many of you
[1:26:06] have gone into your inheritance. But I
[1:26:09] find that there's all through the
[1:26:12] journey there was kings,
[1:26:15] kings, people of authority. And don't
[1:26:19] forget now, this is not God's Eden right
[1:26:22] now. It's Satan's Eden.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Moses brought them out, but Joshua took
[1:26:31] them in. And this is all elementary to
[1:26:33] you.
[1:26:35] But now this is not elementary. Joshua
[1:26:38] here
[1:26:40] is the type and this is in the paradox
[1:26:43] in 1965. Paradox spoken in Phoenix.
[1:26:48] Joshua here is a type of the last day
[1:26:52] ministry.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; If you've been called under the last day
[1:26:57] ministry, you've been called under one
[1:27:01] who has a Joshua commission.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; And now remember those three stages of
[1:27:12] the journey. All of it ceased. First the
[1:27:17] law and everything had to cease. So that
[1:27:21] Joshua and Joshua is the same word as
[1:27:24] Jesus Jehovah's savior that took them
[1:27:28] from the wilderness into the promised
[1:27:30] land.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; I'm here with a burden this morning
[1:27:35] because I realize there are many that
[1:27:38] have not inherited their full
[1:27:40] inheritance.
[1:27:42] that the enemy the Bible says that of
[1:27:45] various of the tribes that they drove
[1:27:47] them out but they could not drive them
[1:27:49] out of the mountains and others that
[1:27:51] drove them out of the valley but they
[1:27:53] couldn't drive them all out and so they
[1:27:56] settled down this is God's children
[1:28:00] settled down in the promised land
[1:28:03] alongside of some that were supposed to
[1:28:05] have been dispossessed and sent out but
[1:28:08] they for whatever reason they you know
[1:28:12] they became understanding or became
[1:28:15] whatever and left the people there and
[1:28:19] uh that's where the a lot of the
[1:28:21] churches
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; you may not like some of the things I'm
[1:28:28] going to say but that's where a lot of
[1:28:30] the message churches are
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; and I've traveled and saw a lot of them
[1:28:33] and I've shaken hands with a lot of
[1:28:35] Christians
[1:28:38] and I begin to detect
[1:28:42] They just have have have almost come to
[1:28:45] a a position of coexistence.
[1:28:50] That kind of that's the way things are
[1:28:52] and we can't do anything about it. It
[1:28:54] might be that way out there, but it's
[1:28:56] not to be that way here.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; It might be that way in someone else's
[1:29:01] life or someone else's home or someone
[1:29:02] else's family. Not to be that way in
[1:29:04] your life, in your family.
[1:29:07] [Music]
[1:29:09] Amen.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Many hold he said that the promised land
[1:29:18] represents heaven. Doesn't represent
[1:29:20] heaven.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; The promised land is not heaven.
[1:29:26] He says it could not re represent heaven
[1:29:29] because they had wars
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; and they had troubles. He said and
[1:29:34] flusterations and everything in the
[1:29:36] promised land. It does not represent
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; the promised land does not represent
[1:29:41] heaven. And you say, "Well, I don't feel
[1:29:44] like I'm in a promised land." If you are
[1:29:46] in God's, if you're in heavenly places
[1:29:50] in Christ Jesus, it's only promised to
[1:29:53] one people and it's promised to blood
[1:29:56] relatives.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; I don't want to say anything that would
[1:30:00] be self-exalting, but I had an
[1:30:03] experience with God. I've had lots of
[1:30:05] wars and lots of troubles, but one thing
[1:30:09] I'm certain of. I'm a son of God.
[1:30:12] [Music]
[1:30:13] That's number one. You must say that.
[1:30:17] You must know that by a by by not just a
[1:30:20] verbal confession, but something that
[1:30:23] rises up within. I have met God.
[1:30:26] Something happened to me. Doesn't have
[1:30:28] to be spectacular. doesn't have to be,
[1:30:32] you know, some thunderbolts from heaven,
[1:30:34] but you just have to know I met God. A
[1:30:37] quiet resolve, a divine something lit up
[1:30:42] inside and something that I I wasn't
[1:30:45] argued into it. I wasn't convinced by
[1:30:48] somebody. Uh but something inside that
[1:30:52] gave a witness. I am a son of God.
[1:30:55] Listen friends, I'm going to preach that
[1:30:57] till you confess it and believe it. And
[1:31:00] if you're not a son of God, you'll say,
[1:31:02] "Before I walk out of this place, I have
[1:31:05] identified myself with the message of
[1:31:08] the hour. God sent this supernatural
[1:31:11] thing not for the millions out there,
[1:31:13] but for and I don't know who for, but he
[1:31:16] sent it for me.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Thank God he found me."
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He found me.
[1:31:33] He talks about when Israel one in a
[1:31:35] million Israel left Egypt approximately
[1:31:38] 2 million people
[1:31:40] and two he said
[1:31:43] two went in he said what was it what was
[1:31:45] the test they all drank of the same w
[1:31:49] they all drank in the same rock they all
[1:31:53] ate the same spiritual mana they were
[1:31:56] all eating This they were all eating
[1:31:58] this morning but the word test
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; proved them.
[1:32:04] When it comes to the time of Kadesh
[1:32:06] Barnea when they started over into the
[1:32:09] promised land they could not go over
[1:32:12] till there was they were tested by the
[1:32:14] word.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; See the word and you're being tested
[1:32:17] even this morning. The word of God says
[1:32:20] certain things. And I challenge you to
[1:32:22] believe that before you walk out those
[1:32:24] doors. And that way you'll confess. Not
[1:32:27] only confess with the mouth, but you'll
[1:32:30] testify. You'll testify
[1:32:33] this word. I am a son of the author of
[1:32:36] this word. I'm a daughter of the author
[1:32:38] of this word. And everything he has
[1:32:41] said, I claim it as mine. Whether I have
[1:32:44] it in my possession is irrelevant right
[1:32:47] at this moment. But I claim it
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; and I move on out
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; to make certain that the world knows and
[1:32:57] especially the demon powers of hell. No,
[1:33:01] I'm a son of God.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; I will not bow.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; I will not bend and I will not burn.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:14] Hallelujah.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb, they are the two that
[1:33:18] went in. The other ones acquired what I
[1:33:22] called the grasshopper syndrome.
[1:33:28] Oh, it's so big.
[1:33:30] I don't know how to overcome it.
[1:33:33] I I was born with this. You were?
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Which birth was it? You were born with
[1:33:39] it.
[1:33:42] It's just my nature. Uh I'm,
[1:33:47] you know, I'm Ukrainian. That way won't
[1:33:50] I know I won't get in trouble. I'm
[1:33:51] Ukrainian. I'm Ukrainian and that's the
[1:33:54] way we all are. I got a
[1:33:59] Thank you, brother Magician.
[1:34:04] I'm German.
[1:34:06] I'm British.
[1:34:11] I'm Russian or whatever more. I say I
[1:34:14] have one phrase, nonsense
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; and you ought to say nonsense.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with it.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Somehow
[1:34:28] people say you're different. I I am very
[1:34:30] different. Son of God,
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; born of another blood cell,
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; born and created by another blood cell,
[1:34:40] spoken word of God.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; And when it came to me, it came to me in
[1:34:46] a voice and I heard it and I believed
[1:34:49] it.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; And nobody's been able to argue me out
[1:34:52] of it. I had people when I was in my 20s
[1:34:54] try to argue me out of something and
[1:34:57] say, "It's not that way. You can prove
[1:34:58] it by the scripture." I said, "You know,
[1:35:00] you're too late. I already experienced
[1:35:02] it.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; You're just too late.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; So don't get the grasshopper syndrome.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Some said, "Oh, we're like
[1:35:14] grasshoppers."
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe they were talking about
[1:35:17] themselves like the people who said to
[1:35:19] brother Gunther in Saskatchewan. He
[1:35:21] said, "I don't like that. I don't like
[1:35:23] the message." Brother Brown talks about
[1:35:25] the eagle in the chicken coupe. the way
[1:35:28] I don't like the way he talks about the
[1:35:30] chickens.
[1:35:33] And and brother Gunzer said, "Well, I'm
[1:35:35] an eagle. I like it."
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; So, here's the other syndrome to have
[1:35:46] have the we're more able.
[1:35:50] That's what Joshua said. That's what
[1:35:52] Caleb said. We're more able.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. These are the conditions of the
[1:35:57] 20th century, but we're more able. Yes,
[1:36:00] there are others that are all swallowed
[1:36:02] up in their business or in their money
[1:36:04] or in their in their education or in in
[1:36:08] their fame or in their sports or
[1:36:10] whatever more. But we're more able.
[1:36:13] [Music]
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Are you saying you might be saying,
[1:36:20] "Well, are you against those things?"
[1:36:22] No, you're against them.
[1:36:28] If you're a son of God,
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; you don't want to be swallowed up by all
[1:36:33] of those things. Yes, we do what's
[1:36:35] necessary. We're going through this
[1:36:37] life. We have to do what's necessary.
[1:36:41] I'll get more into it.
[1:36:44] So, as I said earlier, God is our only
[1:36:46] rightful is the only rightful owner of
[1:36:49] the earth. Psalms 24 and1, the earth is
[1:36:52] the Lord's. Hello.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Whose is it?
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; The earth is the Lord's.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; As a believer, do you believe that?
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; I guess he can do what he wants with it.
[1:37:08] And if he says the meek shall inherit
[1:37:10] the earth,
[1:37:12] amen,
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; I just say, "Father,
[1:37:18] uh, let me come into my inheritance of
[1:37:20] meekness."
[1:37:22] Glory to God because the meek will
[1:37:25] inherit the earth.
[1:37:33] You don't have to be quiet just cuz I'm
[1:37:35] changing page here.
[1:37:39] For by him were all things created.
[1:37:42] Colossians 1:16.
[1:37:44] That are in heaven and that are in the
[1:37:46] earth. Amen.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Visible and invisible,
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; whether they be thrones or dominions or
[1:37:54] principalities
[1:37:56] or powers. All things were created by
[1:38:00] him and for him. He is my ruler. He is
[1:38:05] my master. He's the king of kings. King
[1:38:09] of my life. I crown thee now. Thine the
[1:38:13] glory shall be. Glory. You believe it?
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; I'm not just excited, friends. I'm only
[1:38:20] letting off some steam that's been
[1:38:22] building up for the last two, three
[1:38:24] weeks.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; A testator. Here's what a testator is.
[1:38:32] Before an inheritance can be given,
[1:38:34] before a land can be given,
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; he a testator is one that can dispose of
[1:38:40] by will and make a testament.
[1:38:44] He can make a will and make it or enter
[1:38:48] into a covenant with somebody with one.
[1:38:52] He made a will
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; and he didn't just speak it. He also had
[1:38:56] it written.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet would say and I
[1:39:00] will say the word of God and not just
[1:39:03] word by word
[1:39:06] but the revelation of the word. You can
[1:39:10] memorize the scripture, but you have to
[1:39:12] become acquainted with the author and
[1:39:16] not just acquainted as a friend. He's
[1:39:18] more than a friend. He's a He's more
[1:39:21] than a healer. People are many
[1:39:23] acquainted with him as a healer. He's
[1:39:26] more than a healer. He's more than one
[1:39:28] that just gives blessings. Yes, we need
[1:39:31] blessings, but we need more than that.
[1:39:33] We need redemption.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; We need salvation.
[1:39:38] And the one that is our savior, he is
[1:39:41] all in all.
[1:39:44] [Music]
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Now these are the kings.
[1:39:49] Can you give me some time?
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; These are the kings of the land.
[1:39:57] And the prophet said now and you know
[1:40:00] what was natural there is spiritual
[1:40:02] here. It doesn't make it less important.
[1:40:10] We need to identify
[1:40:13] in our lives when these enemies rise up
[1:40:16] and try to rule us. They're born to
[1:40:19] rule.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; And the spirit world is a very real
[1:40:25] world.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Listen, I I'm just going to offload this
[1:40:29] very quickly.
[1:40:33] I've been in the meetings when the
[1:40:35] prophet of God stood before the people
[1:40:39] and would call out a certain person and
[1:40:42] say, "There's a dark streak
[1:40:46] going from there over someplace else."
[1:40:50] Are you listening?
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; That dark streak might be here. And he
[1:40:56] said it's the spirit,
[1:40:59] the evil spirit
[1:41:01] that is afflicting this person
[1:41:05] knows now because the prophet of God has
[1:41:07] identified it.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; And the it's not not just the person,
[1:41:11] but the Holy Spirit can identify it
[1:41:13] while I'm speaking.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; And then he and then he's afraid that
[1:41:19] deliverance is going to come. He's
[1:41:21] afraid that he's going to lose his hold.
[1:41:24] and he starts screaming out and the
[1:41:26] prophet could hear it in that dimension
[1:41:29] and he would identify another person. He
[1:41:32] would pick out sometimes an epileptic
[1:41:34] and say now it's it's screaming out for
[1:41:38] help because he's afraid going to be
[1:41:41] cast out. He he said the same thing
[1:41:44] about an arthritic case and I don't know
[1:41:47] all I can't you want me to explain it? I
[1:41:49] can't explain it all. I'm not up here as
[1:41:52] an explainer, up here as a preacher.
[1:41:54] This is what this is what happened. But
[1:41:57] now, this is where you're going to have
[1:41:58] to pray for yourself. Say, "God, give me
[1:42:02] divine understanding. Give me a divine
[1:42:06] revelation of what's going on because
[1:42:08] we're talking now about another realm.
[1:42:10] We're talking about another dimension."
[1:42:13] And some of it you may smile at, but I I
[1:42:18] thought I would take the names of many
[1:42:20] of these kings and just by their names,
[1:42:24] we would get
[1:42:26] uh we would get a a a good concept of
[1:42:31] their character and be able to transfer
[1:42:34] that character into your environment,
[1:42:39] into your realm, into this world. in
[1:42:42] 2014 going into 2015. And I can tell you
[1:42:47] that as they were named, you'll be able
[1:42:50] to identify.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; I fought with that guy.
[1:42:56] It's a spirit.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; It's a ruling spirit.
[1:43:04] And they're opposed to you coming into
[1:43:07] your full inheritance.
[1:43:10] They would like you to coexist
[1:43:13] or just become accustomed to this is the
[1:43:17] way things are. No, this isn't the way
[1:43:20] things are and I will not coexist with
[1:43:23] you. You are you have no right of my
[1:43:26] home, of my life, of any part of me.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Friend, just this last week, just this
[1:43:34] last week and every week we encounter
[1:43:36] situations people are burdened. People
[1:43:40] are tore up. People are devastated.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; And you know what it is? It's an
[1:43:46] invasion of demon powers coming into a
[1:43:50] home. And then he has no right. I'm
[1:43:53] going to blast this out. He has no right
[1:43:55] to the believer's home.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; He has no right to anyone claiming to be
[1:44:01] a Christian. He has no right. And
[1:44:04] they'll want to, you know, emulsify and
[1:44:06] say, "Well, we're kind of all one." No,
[1:44:08] we're not one.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; I have no coexistence with that thing.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Say, well, well, you know, you're just a
[1:44:17] a a a man depressant and and you can get
[1:44:20] medication for that. Forget the
[1:44:22] medication. Come down here and get the
[1:44:24] right kind of medication.
[1:44:27] [Music]
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; I determined in my heart this morning,
[1:44:31] if God give me strength and give me
[1:44:33] energy, I'm going to go after that devil
[1:44:35] and after a whole host of them.
[1:44:38] Hallelujah. I'd like my last words on
[1:44:40] this earth is declaring victory
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; over Satan's Eden.
[1:44:46] [Applause]
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; He has not changed his tactics. He tried
[1:44:50] to make Eve see it was reasonable and
[1:44:54] there was promise in it. And he'll use
[1:44:56] the same tactics on you and I. Well,
[1:44:59] this is just reasonable. You have to be
[1:45:00] understanding now. And and this is uh uh
[1:45:03] this is just the way things are. No, it
[1:45:06] isn't just the way things are.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Sehon
[1:45:15] his name means warrior.
[1:45:18] He's a warrior.
[1:45:20] Not so his approach. He's a fighter.
[1:45:25] He doesn't approach anybody as some weak
[1:45:27] need grasshopper.
[1:45:30] He comes as as he's one that is
[1:45:33] accustomed to conquering.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; My whole name, my nature is a warrior.
[1:45:39] I'm a fighter.
[1:45:42] And don't cower.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Don't cower when those things come.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; And we'll get more specific as time goes
[1:45:48] on.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; He was the king of the Amorites.
[1:45:52] And the Amorites is to say or to speak
[1:45:55] or to answer or to give one's to give
[1:45:58] one's heart or to think or to boast or
[1:46:00] to act proudly. This world is absolutely
[1:46:05] obsessed
[1:46:06] with people who want to give their
[1:46:09] opinion and to act proudly that they
[1:46:12] somehow have the answer. They don't have
[1:46:14] the answer. God's word has the answer.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; You believe this? God's word has the
[1:46:22] answer.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; These people had to identify. They had
[1:46:28] to find out who their enemy was. They
[1:46:30] had to determine who it is. And that
[1:46:32] might be the case with people sitting
[1:46:34] here listening to me today. You got to
[1:46:35] find out who is the enemy. May sound
[1:46:38] like it's a a very pleasing or very
[1:46:41] reasonable uh look at this tree. It's
[1:46:44] the fruit is good. and and uh uh and and
[1:46:47] and and she she took time to look. That
[1:46:51] was a big mistake.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; And the serpent didn't try to get her to
[1:46:57] dis
[1:46:59] uh disallow the existence of God. He
[1:47:01] didn't say, "Oh, there's no God or what
[1:47:04] you believe is all wrong." No. No. He
[1:47:06] didn't try that.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; He just inserted or deleted a word here
[1:47:12] and there.
[1:47:15] I want you to you'll not hear this
[1:47:17] message again like from me.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; That was King Sehon.
[1:47:27] Would you like to have followed Moses
[1:47:30] or would you like to have stood beside
[1:47:32] him and he said, "Bring him here and I'm
[1:47:34] going to take his head off."
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; That's the way a believer deals with it.
[1:47:42] Amen.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Bring that thing here that has been
[1:47:46] troubling me. Bring this king here
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; and I will use don't and not just a
[1:47:52] sword, the sword.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; I'll use this sword. I'll use the word
[1:47:59] of God. And if people will believe the
[1:48:01] word of God, you'll make a lot of
[1:48:03] progress. If you don't believe the word,
[1:48:05] it's not for you.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Simple and simple.
[1:48:14] And then the coast of Og,
[1:48:17] the king of Bashon. And Bashon is
[1:48:21] fruitful. So you'll get it from both
[1:48:23] sides. You'll get it from the negative
[1:48:26] side and you'll get it from the from a
[1:48:28] very very enticing side.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Just because something's fruitful and
[1:48:33] it's nice and it's producing things and
[1:48:36] it's a very productive doesn't mean it's
[1:48:38] the right thing. That's right.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; May look good,
[1:48:47] but may not be the right thing.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; And Sehon was king of Heshbon, and
[1:48:58] Heshbon is a stronghold.
[1:49:02] And them did Moses, a servant of the
[1:49:04] Lord, and the children of Israel smite.
[1:49:08] It wasn't they said bad boy.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; When Moses and the children of Israel
[1:49:14] smit these kings, they were done.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Done as far as the children of Israel
[1:49:19] were concerned.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; And gave it for a possession unto the
[1:49:25] Reubenites and the Gadites and the half
[1:49:28] of Manasseh
[1:49:33] and the king of Jericho.
[1:49:36] one. Now, we're going to go we're just
[1:49:39] going to go very quickly and I won't go
[1:49:41] through all of them. It says the king of
[1:49:44] Jericho one and the king of Jerusalem
[1:49:47] one and the king of Hebrron one talking
[1:49:51] about one king over all of these.
[1:49:54] You know the disciples were called by a
[1:49:57] person in the New Testament
[1:50:01] and they were called and said you know
[1:50:03] my son is experiencing such and such and
[1:50:06] he's cast into the throws himself in the
[1:50:08] fire and he throws himself and acts
[1:50:12] violently
[1:50:14] and I went to your disciples and they
[1:50:16] prayed and they could not cast them out
[1:50:20] and Jesus re rebuked them in a sense and
[1:50:22] said oh you of little faith. Why
[1:50:25] couldn't we cast them out? They said,
[1:50:27] "Cuz he cast it out." And Jesus said,
[1:50:30] "Because of your faith." But he said,
[1:50:33] "Nevertheless,
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; This kind, this kind
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; is another kind.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; This kind cometh not out but by fasting
[1:50:43] and prayer."
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:52] We're a very accommodating generation.
[1:50:56] Do not become accustomed to
[1:50:59] accommodating demon powers.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; And they creep in so in such
[1:51:09] uh unobvious ways.
[1:51:14] So the king of Jericho
[1:51:17] won and the king of Ahi.
[1:51:20] How many remember what happened at Ahi?
[1:51:23] Remember what happened there?
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; One of the persons who was supposed to
[1:51:29] he saved some things.
[1:51:31] And uh and Ahi is called a heap of
[1:51:34] ruins. That's what the word means. And
[1:51:37] it says which is the scripture says the
[1:51:40] king of Jericho one and the king of Ahi
[1:51:44] which is beside Bethl.
[1:51:48] You know what Bethl is?
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; The house of God,
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:51:54] This king, this power
[1:51:59] was beside the house of God.
[1:52:04] You know, you must know that all fallen
[1:52:08] angels
[1:52:10] were angels were made to worship.
[1:52:15] And I can tell you everything that looks
[1:52:17] like it might be, you know, of a
[1:52:19] religious nature is not necessarily
[1:52:23] something from God or something of
[1:52:25] truth.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; What do you think about the church world
[1:52:30] today?
[1:52:33] What do you think about the slaves in
[1:52:36] Catholicism,
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; which was my background?
[1:52:51] And the king of Jerusalem.
[1:52:53] What?
[1:52:55] When I saw that, I said, "What? I got to
[1:52:57] look into that." the king of Jerusalem.
[1:53:02] And you know what his name was?
[1:53:04] Adinized.
[1:53:08] Not Melchisedc,
[1:53:10] but Adonisic.
[1:53:14] And his very name means my Lord is
[1:53:17] righteous.
[1:53:19] Hello,
[1:53:22] King of Jerusalem.
[1:53:25] coming out and saying, "Well, I would
[1:53:27] say, where is that today?" Oh, is that
[1:53:30] just a story, friends? Or is that what
[1:53:33] the messenger said? Those things that
[1:53:35] were natural back there are spiritual
[1:53:38] today. Oh, they are.
[1:53:42] Who's this Adinisetic,
[1:53:45] the righteous one, coming out against
[1:53:49] the believer,
[1:53:50] against your inheritance,
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; saying you're not going in.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Don't look at him and say, "Well, you,
[1:53:57] you know, you came from the right place
[1:53:59] and you got the right kind of name and
[1:54:01] you look all right." That's not the
[1:54:04] point.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; What am I saying? You got to have
[1:54:07] eyesight that's better than this human
[1:54:09] eyesight. You got to have understanding
[1:54:11] that's better than it's human
[1:54:12] understanding.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; And Jerusalem is the teaching of peace.
[1:54:23] To be in a covenant of peace. Peace.
[1:54:26] Peace. United Nations. Peace. Peace. Got
[1:54:29] to have peace. We got to have another
[1:54:31] meeting. Got to have another convention.
[1:54:33] Got to have another what? You'll never
[1:54:34] have peace till the king of peace comes.
[1:54:39] When the king of peace comes, oh, I want
[1:54:43] to be in my full inheritance. When that
[1:54:46] king of peace and true justice is here
[1:54:48] on earth and this earth has gone through
[1:54:51] a renovation, we won't be talking about
[1:54:54] pollution.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; We won't be talking about uh a a a green
[1:54:58] society. We won't need to. The author
[1:55:02] will be back.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; The owner.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; The owner. I made all things. And when
[1:55:08] he made it, even God himself almighty
[1:55:10] looked upon and said, "It's good.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; It's very good."
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, when he takes rulership, I say,
[1:55:19] "King of my life, I crown thee now king
[1:55:23] of kings."
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Hang on to whatever you can hang on to.
[1:55:32] Adonisedic,
[1:55:35] my lord is righteous. He was the king of
[1:55:37] Jerusalem teaching of peace.
[1:55:41] And that king which is a spiritual power
[1:55:44] today comes out with the same uh
[1:55:49] kind of the same attitude or the same
[1:55:52] characteristic.
[1:55:55] You'll be surprised how many of these
[1:55:57] are
[1:55:58] almost worshipful
[1:56:00] type of powers
[1:56:03] for this and the and and the apostle
[1:56:05] Paul speaks in Hebrews 7:1 for this
[1:56:09] Melzdc
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; king of Salem preached and the prophet
[1:56:14] preached who is this Melzdc.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Did I leave you there? No. Who is this?
[1:56:24] Ministries get it.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Some of the believers get it. Who is
[1:56:29] this
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; prophet crying out, screaming out, who
[1:56:34] is this Melzdc? He wasn't asking it to
[1:56:38] leave us in a a baffled state. He he he
[1:56:42] spoke that to leave us in an informed
[1:56:45] state.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Who is this Melzdc,
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; priest of the most high God? King of
[1:56:53] Salem.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; And the pro and the and apostle Paul
[1:56:58] said for this Melzdc
[1:57:00] and the prophet of God said that Melzdc
[1:57:03] back there you don't hear him anymore.
[1:57:05] He became Jesus.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; And now Jesus ascended and apostle Paul
[1:57:11] picks it up and he's saying for this
[1:57:13] Melzdc because that Melzdc is the
[1:57:17] eternal one without beginning of days
[1:57:19] nor end of life.
[1:57:22] Who is this Melzdc without beginning of
[1:57:25] days nor end of life? The almighty God
[1:57:29] quad. He can manifest himself in
[1:57:31] whatever form he wishes to manifest
[1:57:34] himself. And I can tell you in the
[1:57:36] prophet's ministry was part of that
[1:57:38] ministry to introduce to you this
[1:57:41] Melzdc.
[1:57:42] [Music]
[1:57:44] Amen.
[1:57:45] [Applause]
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; You young people, young ladies, young
[1:57:48] men, I want you especially to get it for
[1:57:51] your age,
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; for the world you live in.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Don't ever forget this Mazdc
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; is part and parcel of this message.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; That's what all you won't find it
[1:58:03] anywhere else.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; It's part and parcel of this message.
[1:58:07] And he said, "This MelzDC, king of
[1:58:09] Salem, priest of the most high God, who
[1:58:12] met Abraham returning met Abraham
[1:58:16] returning from the slaughter of the
[1:58:19] kings."
[1:58:21] [Applause]
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Not from shaking hand with the kings,
[1:58:28] not from making some kind of compromise
[1:58:30] with the kings, but he met Abraham.
[1:58:33] Melchazdc met Abraham, king of peace.
[1:58:36] Salem, king of the most high God, met
[1:58:39] Abraham returning from the slaughter of
[1:58:42] the kings. I say, "Oh God, Melzdc,
[1:58:46] meet me.
[1:58:48] Melzdc, meet me.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; I have no love for these kings of this
[1:58:54] earth.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; I have no love for these spirits of
[1:58:58] hell."
[1:59:05] Hallelujah.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Anybody try to talk you away from the
[1:59:09] fellowship of the Holy Ghost? You won't
[1:59:12] be kind to the thing. Just say, "I know
[1:59:14] you.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; You religious spirit.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Get out of my presence."
[1:59:20] [Applause]
[1:59:23] until you show me the until you show me.
[1:59:26] Until you bring right into my presence,
[1:59:29] the same thing the prophet of God showed
[1:59:32] manifested before the people the
[1:59:34] absolute vindication of God from another
[1:59:37] realm and brought it right to the
[1:59:39] public. Until you show me that, don't
[1:59:42] speak to me anymore.
[1:59:44] [Applause]
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Cut off all the conversing.
[1:59:50] [Applause]
[2:00:03] the king of Jerusalem
[2:00:05] and the king of Hebrron.
[2:00:08] He is still in the hands
[2:00:12] in a Palestinian area, I believe.
[2:00:16] But Hebron,
[2:00:18] king of Hebrron, the main meaning for
[2:00:20] Hebrron is association.
[2:00:26] Brother Brandham said to me,
[2:00:32] he said, "Brother Eddie,
[2:00:34] you don't have to tell me what kind of
[2:00:36] person you are." Said, "Show me your
[2:00:39] friends and I'll tell you what kind of
[2:00:42] person you are.
[2:00:46] I never forgot it.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; He was silent for a moment
[2:00:54] and brother Southwick was just standing
[2:00:56] nearby
[2:00:58] and he said, "You have good friends."
[2:01:04] speaking of brother Southwick and some
[2:01:06] of the people I guess that would come
[2:01:09] out or the people that we were
[2:01:10] associated with and I was associated
[2:01:13] with many many native Indian people at
[2:01:15] the time
[2:01:17] said you have good friends
[2:01:20] I'll tell you young people
[2:01:22] make sure that king of
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Hebron
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; isn't bringing to your associates
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; under the guise
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; my friends.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Who's your friends?
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Who said they were friends?
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; You want to go to your father and ask
[2:01:40] him if he's if they're friends. Well, my
[2:01:43] associates, people I associate with, I
[2:01:46] say, if it's king of Hebron, take his
[2:01:48] head off.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, that sounds so stark."
[2:01:52] Take his head off.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; I won't change. I won't change the
[2:01:54] message. Forget it. Cut it off.
[2:02:01] Well, they're my loved ones. Oh, really?
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Are they born again?
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; I know this may sound harsh. You can't
[2:02:14] play
[2:02:16] games with the world.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; You'll play your way right into the
[2:02:21] tribulation.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; You'll play right right into missing the
[2:02:25] rapture.
[2:02:26] Okay. You say, "Is that a fear tech?"
[2:02:28] No, it's not a fear tactic. That's
[2:02:30] that's what's written in the will.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in unconditional
[2:02:40] covenant. He said, "Separate yourself
[2:02:43] from your kindreds."
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; From your peoples,
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; separate from your associates.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Separate from your habits.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. separate from everything that come
[2:02:53] out
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; and stand alone for God.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Says there's where the first man
[2:02:59] was called and there's where the last
[2:03:01] man was called.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; There's king of Jarmouth which was the
[2:03:06] heights and the king of Lakish
[2:03:10] invincible.
[2:03:12] Oh, ever come and confront something
[2:03:15] that's invincible.
[2:03:18] I was in a meeting.
[2:03:21] I was in a meeting
[2:03:23] and they're mostly native people and
[2:03:26] another brother was bachelor brother
[2:03:28] very close brother Brandham mentions him
[2:03:32] his name is Bentrude and we helped to
[2:03:36] get a little church there up in a place
[2:03:38] called Chatwin
[2:03:43] and we I came and I stood to the pulpit
[2:03:47] and a young man that was out over here
[2:03:50] he began began to react.
[2:03:52] He began to throw himself around. He
[2:03:55] began to be violent. He was strong. He
[2:03:58] was probably in his early 20s.
[2:04:00] And uh brothers run up to me and said he
[2:04:03] he disturbs meetings. He that he breaks
[2:04:06] up meetings and uh and uh and and like
[2:04:10] you know and I just asked the people be
[2:04:13] just real quiet and be real reverent.
[2:04:17] And we bowed our head and bound that
[2:04:20] demon spirit.
[2:04:23] And he sat there. There were two, three
[2:04:24] men trying to hold him. And he sat down.
[2:04:28] They sat him down in his chair in his at
[2:04:31] the back. And I preached and I started
[2:04:34] preaching and finished the service. And
[2:04:36] when he was done, uh when I was done, I
[2:04:39] said, "How how what's he doing?" And he
[2:04:41] had a bandana, a polka dot red bandana,
[2:04:45] and he was taking and he would just had
[2:04:47] he all he did all he could do is twist
[2:04:49] that in his hands. He sat there for that
[2:04:51] whole time that I was preaching just
[2:04:53] twisting that in his hand. He wasn't
[2:04:56] free, but he couldn't he couldn't
[2:04:58] disturb
[2:04:59] the presence of God. And we finished the
[2:05:02] meeting and I don't know whether he was
[2:05:06] delivered or not. I do not know. But I
[2:05:08] know one thing for sure. That spirit is
[2:05:11] subject to the believer.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Don't cower.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Take your stand upon the word of God
[2:05:23] because that's your inheritance. It
[2:05:25] belongs to you.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; There's people here perhaps you have
[2:05:31] children
[2:05:32] and they're away from God and you hear
[2:05:35] it preached over the pulpit. I just want
[2:05:38] to bring it to you in a little different
[2:05:39] way. It's part of your inheritance.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; It's part of your inheritance.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; And just with that quiet,
[2:05:50] peaceful
[2:05:52] faith in God,
[2:05:54] God,
[2:05:56] you gave me this child.
[2:06:02] This is part of my inheritance.
[2:06:05] I claim them.
[2:06:07] for you.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; You're quiet.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Fact is, friends, I don't know anything
[2:06:21] else that works.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; That works.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching for those of you that may
[2:06:32] have cowed and said, "Well, this seems
[2:06:35] like it's monstrous. It seems like it's
[2:06:37] invincible. That's him.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Where do you think he went to?
[2:06:42] You hear a prophet, you hear it over and
[2:06:44] over again. It's not just a message. You
[2:06:46] hear that people die. The spirit doesn't
[2:06:49] die.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Where is it? Where is that? Oh, you say,
[2:06:52] "Well, he's he he's here with us in the
[2:06:54] house of God." No, he's not. He never
[2:06:56] got converted.
[2:06:58] This king of he
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; who demonstrates and wants to make
[2:07:01] himself as ma as invincible. I'm here to
[2:07:05] tell you he's not invincible.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; My leader Joshua destroyed him,
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; smokeote him as an example. That's what
[2:07:14] we are to do.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Joshua didn't go and do it himself. All
[2:07:19] of the people went with him.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; The people went with him. Friends, I'm
[2:07:24] not up here as a as a as some kind of a
[2:07:28] a um
[2:07:31] what do you call a robot?
[2:07:34] I wasn't forced up here to preach this.
[2:07:37] And nobody forced me to preach this.
[2:07:40] But I feel if this were my last service,
[2:07:42] I would want to say to you, go after
[2:07:44] him.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Don't let him tell you who your
[2:07:47] associates are going to be. Don't tell
[2:07:50] him who who your friends are going to
[2:07:51] be. Don't let him tell you and instruct
[2:07:55] you. You have nothing to do with him.
[2:07:57] And let the spirit know you're not
[2:07:59] invincible. In fact, is your defeated
[2:08:02] weakling. My Lord Jesus, the King of
[2:08:05] Kings,
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; has already told me you're defeated.
[2:08:10] [Music]
[2:08:16] [Music]
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; King of Dber. D E V I R
[2:08:23] it's a sanctuary.
[2:08:26] King of gad is a wall protected.
[2:08:32] King of Hora
[2:08:34] devotion.
[2:08:36] Doesn't it sound nice?
[2:08:40] King of Libna
[2:08:43] one the king of Adulam
[2:08:47] which is justice for the people.
[2:08:53] These are spirits.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; They're present.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; In fact is I want to say something to
[2:09:00] you people.
[2:09:03] We live in a high-tech world.
[2:09:07] Information is going on the information
[2:09:09] highway around the globe in seconds.
[2:09:21] These kings that were existing and
[2:09:25] living in Joshua's day, they didn't have
[2:09:28] internet.
[2:09:31] They didn't have the same perhaps the
[2:09:34] same uh justice system in the land where
[2:09:39] you do that, I'm going to sue you.
[2:09:42] They didn't have that. But Joshua
[2:09:47] tells us how he dealt with it. It's very
[2:09:49] very clear. Read the book of Joshua.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; The first part is tough reading
[2:09:57] because he did not deal with these
[2:09:59] people easily.
[2:10:02] And the prophet of God who we claim to
[2:10:06] follow,
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; he spoke of his ministry and his
[2:10:11] commission, Joshua's commission as his
[2:10:14] commission.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; He is representative of the end time.
[2:10:18] He's saying, I'm representative of the
[2:10:21] end time messenger of that commission.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Then I say to you, what about all the
[2:10:28] other people that this Joshua cleaned
[2:10:31] up?
[2:10:33] What about the people who have
[2:10:35] identified Joshua? You're our leader. As
[2:10:38] I was with Moses, so will I be with you.
[2:10:42] That's what I believe.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; As he was the God of Moses is the God of
[2:10:46] Joshua.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; The God of Joshua is my God.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Savior. You want to say that
[2:10:54] friends, you want to be aggressive with
[2:10:56] it. That's my God.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; And the kings that he encountered are
[2:11:02] still present. He that's invisible. He
[2:11:05] that's invincible. He that feels he's
[2:11:08] like a warrior. He that's in a
[2:11:10] sanctuary. He that lives beside Bethl.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; None of those things going to affect me.
[2:11:16] [Applause]
[2:11:19] And the same prophet tells us,
[2:11:24] "Don't distress
[2:11:26] the children of Moab.
[2:11:28] Don't go out and try to castigate them
[2:11:31] and blast them and say or serpent seed
[2:11:35] or whatever more. That's not the point.
[2:11:37] Don't do that." He said, "Just walk
[2:11:39] softly.
[2:11:41] Pass by softly.
[2:11:44] That's what God gave them. That's as far
[2:11:46] as they see. That's as far as they're
[2:11:49] going to go and just pass by softly. He
[2:11:53] said, "That's not for you.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; That's not for me. Their inheritance,
[2:11:59] that's not mine. They can be a
[2:12:01] borderline or whatever more. It's not
[2:12:03] even up to me to say it. I don't have to
[2:12:05] class them."
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Are you getting something out of this?
[2:12:12] Amen.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; This is full of instruction.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; I want to name a a few kings. I want to
[2:12:22] change their name.
[2:12:27] King complex.
[2:12:33] Hello.
[2:12:36] King complex.
[2:12:39] It's so simple for people to say, "Well,
[2:12:41] I got a complex." You do.
[2:12:45] You got a warrior right here coming
[2:12:47] after that
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; devil. And telling you as a people of
[2:12:52] God, we're going to slay that complex.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; We're going to get rid of it.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; We're not going to associate with it.
[2:13:00] You don't have to associate with it. Who
[2:13:02] said you have a complex?
[2:13:04] Amen.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what a prophet of God has
[2:13:08] said.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "I couldn't get the fellow off
[2:13:13] my mind." You know, he said, "What I'm
[2:13:16] going to do, I'm going to" And he's
[2:13:18] talking about another man, a man whose
[2:13:21] wife came to brother Brandham's
[2:13:23] meetings.
[2:13:24] And this man is saying, "I couldn't get
[2:13:26] the fellow off my mind. You know what
[2:13:28] I'm going to do? I'm going to go down
[2:13:31] there to the gate where he comes in. And
[2:13:34] when he comes into that gate, I'm going
[2:13:36] to give him a piece of my mind for
[2:13:39] having my wife out these meetings and
[2:13:42] carrying on like that because he was so
[2:13:44] opposed to his wife being in the
[2:13:46] meetings. I'm going to tell him what I
[2:13:48] think about him. And brother Brandon
[2:13:50] says, you know, usually people build up
[2:13:54] that kind of a complex, you know, just
[2:13:57] on hearing something.
[2:14:07] I have people come and they say well you
[2:14:09] know I heard oh just stop there
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; we don't want to give king complex
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; in this day of just instantaneous
[2:14:22] here's what I think and here's what my
[2:14:24] my opinion and I'm going to twitter this
[2:14:26] and you go on and Twitter till you drop
[2:14:29] off the brink. I don't care about who
[2:14:31] you Twitter.
[2:14:34] I'm going to tell people what I think on
[2:14:36] Facebook and all these things. Go right
[2:14:38] ahead. Just make sure you're not making
[2:14:41] friends with King Complex.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; The prophet, your prophet said on
[2:14:46] hearing
[2:14:48] on hearing some things,
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; he built up a complex.
[2:14:53] [Music]
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give him a piece of my mind
[2:14:56] when I see him. He built up that complex
[2:15:00] from things he had heard.
[2:15:06] Well, you know, I've heard that people
[2:15:07] have all these kind of questions and all
[2:15:09] this kind of thing and so on and so
[2:15:11] forth. Just be careful lest you build up
[2:15:14] a complex.
[2:15:16] A kind of complex.
[2:15:19] And friend,
[2:15:22] I'm talking I'm not talking about just a
[2:15:24] complex. I'm talking about king complex.
[2:15:27] the the king that starts telling you who
[2:15:30] you're going to fellowship with,
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; When you're going to go to church,
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; if you're going to go to church, and if
[2:15:37] are you going to listen or are you just
[2:15:39] going to pass it off or is it just a
[2:15:41] place where you kind of fellowship and
[2:15:43] you go out and, you know, chatter with a
[2:15:45] bunch of other people? It's just where
[2:15:46] you are with the young people.
[2:15:51] You got a good pair of ears. Just make
[2:15:54] sure you know what you're hearing.
[2:16:00] Even in the home around the dinner
[2:16:02] table,
[2:16:04] words can be discussed about the
[2:16:06] preacher, about another sister, about
[2:16:09] another brother and the children are
[2:16:11] there building up a complex
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; from hearing what they've hearing what
[2:16:18] has been spoken
[2:16:24] and standing in the gap.
[2:16:27] Brother Brandham said this about
[2:16:28] himself.
[2:16:31] Pray that God will place into my heart
[2:16:35] that something
[2:16:37] that I lost out there in that complex.
[2:16:43] A complex king complex
[2:16:46] not can will
[2:16:49] make you lose something of your
[2:16:51] inheritance.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; That purpose
[2:16:58] Friends, I'm here today for this
[2:17:02] congregation that I love,
[2:17:04] this group and church of people that
[2:17:06] I've given my life for. I want to see
[2:17:10] you be able to inherit
[2:17:12] and not allow these natural things, be
[2:17:16] it a complex, be it some other thing, I
[2:17:19] heard this or some associates or some
[2:17:22] association or whatever more.
[2:17:25] Don't in the name of Jesus Christ bend
[2:17:28] down to it.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; Don't cower to it.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; This is not a story. This is not merely
[2:17:35] a sermon. This is from the word of God
[2:17:38] and from the messenger which said very
[2:17:40] clearly those things were in the natural
[2:17:44] and today they're in the spiritual and
[2:17:46] it's up to us to identify them.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; I'll only be another few minutes,
[2:17:52] please.
[2:18:02] They say that a complex, and I'll be off
[2:18:04] of it now, is a pattern of emotions
[2:18:09] or memories
[2:18:14] or perceptions
[2:18:17] and wishes within oneself organized
[2:18:20] around a common theme.
[2:18:24] You know, brother Brandon was very, very
[2:18:26] personal and that gives me some courage.
[2:18:31] Do you mind if I just be confess some
[2:18:34] things? I got all three of my daughters
[2:18:37] here. They're girls. My wife is here and
[2:18:42] she's a girl. And they have woman talk.
[2:18:47] They all talk and
[2:18:50] didn't and chatter about this and
[2:18:51] chatter about that and what I'm going to
[2:18:52] do and what I'm going to get and what
[2:18:54] I'm going to buy and know.
[2:18:57] How many husbands can say amen?
[2:19:02] I think you were cowering
[2:19:08] and and uh uh you know and I sit and
[2:19:12] listen and you know now I'm going to
[2:19:14] just be very very honest. I sit and
[2:19:16] listen and you know and so I go back
[2:19:19] into my memory and they talk about this
[2:19:22] one doing that and that one doing
[2:19:23] something else and you know going to
[2:19:25] have this birthday party and that and I
[2:19:26] think well I think the first birthday
[2:19:29] that I remember is one my wife put on
[2:19:31] for me when I was 16.
[2:19:34] I think that's the first birthday party.
[2:19:37] And I I think that there was one when I
[2:19:39] was a kid out at some other farm and I
[2:19:42] was just
[2:19:44] I was just taken out there. So I was in
[2:19:48] one farm, then I was in another farm,
[2:19:50] another place, and then I was, you know,
[2:19:54] at a camp in a US Army camp, and then
[2:19:57] skidding our our beds around the heater.
[2:20:00] I'm not trying to make you this. These
[2:20:02] are my memories. That's what I think
[2:20:03] about. So I think about these things and
[2:20:06] I I just start thinking about these
[2:20:08] memories and I start thinking you know
[2:20:10] I'm not I'm not really a part of
[2:20:14] my you know my family they they had a
[2:20:16] home I didn't have a home and so you
[2:20:18] start thinking about that
[2:20:20] you know they had a mother and dad and
[2:20:22] we were at home all the time and I
[2:20:25] didn't have a mother and dad at home I
[2:20:26] had a stepmom and she's way up the
[2:20:28] Alaska Highway and my father's up the
[2:20:30] Alaska Highway. He's working in the cook
[2:20:32] house and he's working in the carpenter
[2:20:34] shop and I'm I'm with an aged couple
[2:20:37] that never had any children had a
[2:20:39] blacksmith shop. So I'd pay a little
[2:20:41] spend a little time in the blacksmith
[2:20:42] shop and entertain myself and I enjoyed
[2:20:45] it, you know, but lonely.
[2:20:48] So I think of the lonely time from the
[2:20:51] time I was 15,
[2:20:53] 16, 17, 18. I in in a few years from the
[2:20:59] time I was 8 to 15 I moved 13 times and
[2:21:04] then I counted it and I guess I was
[2:21:06] wrong. I got to 17 one time
[2:21:12] and maybe you can't quite imagine that
[2:21:15] but but I listened to the family and
[2:21:17] they're you know they're going there and
[2:21:19] this opportunity and the grandsons and
[2:21:22] what they're doing and I I thought you
[2:21:23] know I'm not part of that. So I guess I
[2:21:27] just got in my own little world.
[2:21:30] And then God in his grace
[2:21:35] spoke to me said don't build up a
[2:21:38] complex
[2:21:41] by hearing something.
[2:21:44] Don't build up a complex. So I preached
[2:21:46] to myself as well as I preached to you.
[2:21:50] And I have the same I have the same. And
[2:21:53] I had I had a complete release from it,
[2:21:55] you know. Yeah. You still have your
[2:21:57] memories. You still have your maybe
[2:21:58] something bad happened in your life.
[2:22:01] Maybe something in the in the past.
[2:22:05] King complex
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; will come and try and major on that and
[2:22:10] put a complex on you for your life in
[2:22:13] Christ. Listen, I'm not just I this
[2:22:17] isn't just, you know, imaginary thing.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Don't allow that to happen.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; And I'm not preaching on so you'll have
[2:22:27] a better life. I'm speaking about it so
[2:22:29] that you go into your inheritance.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; King complex trying to keep you out. And
[2:22:35] then this is this is a Christmas season
[2:22:37] I'm going to end on here because it
[2:22:38] might be a downer for some people. But
[2:22:40] nevertheless,
[2:22:44] I'll just say it quickly. There there's
[2:22:47] king economy
[2:22:49] and he's got a prince called credit
[2:22:51] card.
[2:23:00] I I you know there's one credit card. I
[2:23:03] think it's probably the best thing I do.
[2:23:04] Lay it here on the altar.
[2:23:07] There's the church credit card. I'll lay
[2:23:08] that on the altar, too. And here's
[2:23:10] another visa. I'll lay that on the
[2:23:12] altar. Matter of fact, I might as well
[2:23:14] put the whole works there.
[2:23:15] [Applause]
[2:23:18] Amen.
[2:23:20] But are they enticing? Oh, they're so
[2:23:22] enticing. Oh, and they just just have a
[2:23:25] look. Have a look. The king king economy
[2:23:27] say just have a look. Have a look. And
[2:23:30] uh uh sometime you know it was rain
[2:23:32] raining out in this country. I've never
[2:23:34] preached like this in my life so forgive
[2:23:36] me. Raining in this country and we're
[2:23:38] wife and I were getting up me years. We
[2:23:39] go we got to walk. I've been sitting
[2:23:41] here studying for about eight or 10
[2:23:43] hours. We got to walk. We don't Well,
[2:23:44] let's let's go down to let's go and walk
[2:23:47] in Walmart.
[2:23:51] I think I think King Economy is coming
[2:23:53] in on an invasion cuz I'm going to see
[2:23:57] something I think I need.
[2:24:00] And uh Prince uh credit card will come
[2:24:03] out and make it easy for me to do.
[2:24:09] Oh, I know. Look pious us and say it
[2:24:12] doesn't apply to me. Of course, it
[2:24:14] applies to you.
[2:24:16] It applies to all of us. And then uh and
[2:24:21] then the crunch comes
[2:24:25] cuz cuz you know Prince credit card
[2:24:28] wants payment and the interest and all
[2:24:33] these other things all all at the same
[2:24:36] time. Do you know what I'm talking
[2:24:39] about?
[2:24:41] No, they don't know what I'm talking
[2:24:42] about. Do you folks know what I'm
[2:24:43] talking about?
[2:24:47] You know, I love brother Tim fruit. In
[2:24:49] fact is we've asked him to come you know
[2:24:53] I've asked him to come sometime he's
[2:24:55] able and you know he's preaching to his
[2:24:58] people and finally he says hey all you
[2:25:02] folks out there on the internet I'm
[2:25:05] preaching to you listen I don't know
[2:25:07] where these folks are.
[2:25:09] That's what he said to his congregation
[2:25:12] but I I think I know where you're at.
[2:25:14] You're sitting and listening and
[2:25:15] absorbing all of this. And I I believe
[2:25:18] you'll go home and you'll acknowledge
[2:25:21] that these kings,
[2:25:23] the spirit of them is present in this
[2:25:27] land. And I'd like you to go out of
[2:25:29] these doors and say and declare, you
[2:25:33] know, why you may have cowed to
[2:25:35] something. I was kind of born with this
[2:25:37] or this was, you know, in my nature or
[2:25:39] or this is the way I I've developed
[2:25:42] this. I say you want to really you need
[2:25:46] to check it out and see if it's keeping
[2:25:48] you back
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; from what God has fully given to you.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; I'm going to pray that God will open
[2:25:57] your heart and open your eyes and let
[2:26:00] you see.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; What he really has for you.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; I want to say this to this congregation
[2:26:06] of believers and all that may be on the
[2:26:08] internet.
[2:26:10] God has a measure
[2:26:14] of victory
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; for you.
[2:26:18] And I'm not going to speak in
[2:26:20] generalities now. I'm going to speak
[2:26:21] specific on the thing. You have to
[2:26:24] identify it yourself. On the thing, I'm
[2:26:27] going to encourage you to identify your
[2:26:30] enemy. And you say, "That thing has held
[2:26:34] me back
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; for all of these years since I received
[2:26:38] Christ. that thing has held me back. I'm
[2:26:42] saying to you this morning, identify
[2:26:45] that thing as they did in Joshua's time.
[2:26:47] They identified the enemy that held them
[2:26:50] back and gave them such trouble.
[2:26:53] Identify it and say, "I heard the word
[2:26:56] this morning." And and this is the end
[2:26:59] for you. You are not going to control
[2:27:01] me. You're not going to be king of my
[2:27:04] life. I'm not coming under your
[2:27:06] rulership. I'm coming under the
[2:27:08] rulership of the word of God who has
[2:27:12] declared and manifested himself in this
[2:27:14] word. Listen friends, I don't know any
[2:27:16] other protection outside of this message
[2:27:18] of the hour.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet.
[2:27:41] This song may not apply to you, but
[2:27:45] I would like to sing. King of my life, I
[2:27:48] crown thee now. Thine shall the glory
[2:27:50] be.
[2:27:52] It sounds sounds like because it refers
[2:27:56] to Gethsemane.
[2:28:02] Lest I forget thy thorn crown brow.
[2:28:07] Dear people, if I was sitting across a
[2:28:09] desk from you, I'd be saying the same
[2:28:10] thing.
[2:28:13] Don't allow
[2:28:15] this thing has tried to strangle your
[2:28:17] spiritual life.
[2:28:20] I would like you to declare it. I'm not
[2:28:22] trying to excite you. I'm trying to tell
[2:28:25] you the absolute truth. If you read
[2:28:28] Joshua, they smoked them.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; They did not treat them with with uh kid
[2:28:34] gloves. They smoked them.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; They took the rulership away from them.
[2:28:40] And your Lord Jesus Christ, I would like
[2:28:43] you to sing this chorus if you know it.
[2:28:46] and asking brother Nathan to sing, King
[2:28:48] of my life, I crown thee now, thine
[2:28:53] shall the glory be, lest I forget thy
[2:28:56] thorn crown brow, lead me to Calvary.
[2:29:00] And there at Calvary, you'll see the
[2:29:03] blood that bought you. You'll know I'm a
[2:29:06] son. And if a son, I'm an heir, and I'm
[2:29:09] an heir to a better life than I have
[2:29:11] experienced.
[2:29:12] And I will not allow this thing to
[2:29:15] hinder me, to hold me back, or to bind
[2:29:18] me any longer. And
[2:29:22] [Music]
[2:29:28] they weren't afraid.
[2:29:31] They weren't afraid. I'm talking about
[2:29:33] believers now. Some of the children of
[2:29:34] Israel weren't afraid to call and say to
[2:29:38] Joshua, "We need help.
[2:29:41] We need help.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; You may be in that place. I need help.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; Get it this morning.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; He said, and he said, furthermore, if
[2:29:51] those spirits call to one another and
[2:29:54] scream to one another, he said, "What
[2:29:57] about the house of God? What about
[2:29:59] believers? You that are standing there,
[2:30:01] you got somebody beside you and they
[2:30:04] believe this word. And if two shall
[2:30:06] agree and bind your heart together, it
[2:30:09] shall be done.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm not interested in just
[2:30:15] living another day and carrying on in
[2:30:19] society and being an okay kind of
[2:30:21] person. I want to be victorious. I want
[2:30:24] you to be victorious.
[2:30:26] And do not fear.
[2:30:29] There's no place that these people fear
[2:30:31] these these enemies. It's not back
[2:30:34] there. It's here.
[2:30:38] It's not back there. It's not 2500 years
[2:30:41] ago or 3,000 years ago. It's not that.
[2:30:45] And you have a prophet that told you
[2:30:48] that was what's natural. There is
[2:30:50] spiritual today. Let us not as spiritual
[2:30:53] people handle it any differently than
[2:30:56] they handled it. And I can't tell you
[2:30:59] they didn't do anything, but they smoked
[2:31:01] it and got rid of it. Let's do that.
[2:31:05] [Music]
[2:31:09] Jonathan Walder,
[2:31:12] I tell your testimony quite often,
[2:31:15] and the people here might as well know
[2:31:17] Jonathan Durie would be the same.
[2:31:22] I saw Jonathan Walder sitting where Orin
[2:31:24] is.
[2:31:27] I'm sitting on the platform and I'm
[2:31:29] looking over. His face is like a light
[2:31:32] bulb
[2:31:34] glowing with the glory of God.
[2:31:38] I wasn't sure whose
[2:31:40] whose family he was connected with or if
[2:31:42] he was connected with the family
[2:31:46] and I spent quite a bit of time
[2:31:47] straining to look at him because he'd
[2:31:49] been in the meeting quite a few times
[2:31:51] and I couldn't identify who he was. Then
[2:31:54] it came to my mind he's I believe he
[2:31:57] must be uh brother Michael Walner's son.
[2:32:01] Brother Michael Walner sister Helen must
[2:32:04] be their son. And the more I looked the
[2:32:07] more I could identify the family
[2:32:09] resemblance.
[2:32:10] But I didn't I and here I am today
[2:32:14] perhaps 2 and 1/2 years later.
[2:32:17] That's why I know what's happening is is
[2:32:20] God Almighty.
[2:32:22] I don't know how he was delivered. I
[2:32:25] don't know how it happened. And that's
[2:32:27] not important for me to know how. All
[2:32:30] Joshua knew, and I'm not likening myself
[2:32:32] to Joshua at all. I know the message
[2:32:35] that we're under. I know one thing, it
[2:32:37] works.
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; I know one thing is powerful.
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; I know one thing. When God of this word
[2:32:43] gets a hold and God of Elijah takes hold
[2:32:45] of a life, he's free.
[2:32:48] &gt;&gt; They're free. They're delivered.
[2:32:52] And I haven't found out yet what
[2:32:54] happened, how it happened. You know
[2:32:57] what? I don't really care how it
[2:32:58] happened. All I care about is that it
[2:33:01] happened.
[2:33:03] How much support do I have in this
[2:33:05] congregation?
[2:33:07] You believe these things?
[2:33:09] You believe these things? Are you
[2:33:12] believers?
[2:33:14] I tell you, be aggressive. go out after
[2:33:17] this enemy and don't don't don't have a
[2:33:20] kind of coexistence with him. No sir,
[2:33:23] you got wrong associates. You settle it
[2:33:26] here today. That doesn't mean a person
[2:33:29] isn't around other people, but you're in
[2:33:32] another world. You're from another
[2:33:34] kingdom. You're from another family. And
[2:33:37] I want to say today to all those born
[2:33:39] again, God is our father.
[2:33:43] [Music]
[2:33:45] God gave us this word.
[2:33:48] God didn't just give a land, but he gave
[2:33:51] it to them. And the prophet said that
[2:33:54] they went in, they had to fight for it.
[2:33:56] And I'm prepared to fight. I'm prepared
[2:33:59] to continue on. I'm prepared to preach
[2:34:02] against him. I'm prepared to preach
[2:34:04] faith to the people. And you can live on
[2:34:06] a higher plane. I don't care what this
[2:34:09] world hands you out, delivers to you.
[2:34:13] God has delivered a word to you. God has
[2:34:15] delivered a message to you. And in that
[2:34:18] message is power. In that very word is
[2:34:20] power.
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; Sing with me.
[2:34:40] Now thy
[2:34:43] [Music]
[2:34:48] blessing
[2:34:51] [Music]
[2:34:57] to calary.
[2:35:02] Bless I forget.
[2:35:09] Let I forget thy
[2:35:15] [Music]
[2:35:17] I forget thy love for me
[2:35:23] [Music]
[2:35:24] to calary.
[2:35:30] May I be worthy
[2:35:34] for you?
[2:35:38] I cross foreless
[2:35:42] [Music]
[2:35:58] I for
[2:36:05] I
[2:36:07] My
[2:36:11] blessing
[2:36:15] [Music]
[2:36:19] to calary.
[2:36:24] till we
[2:36:28] ride
[2:36:30] [Music]
[2:36:32] on
[2:36:37] now.
[2:36:38] [Music]
[2:36:52] I forget.
[2:36:58] Yes, I forget my
[2:37:05] friends. I for
[2:37:08] [Music]
[2:37:21] the Lord is directing me to help prayer
[2:37:25] for some people.
[2:37:28] And I want you to I want to invite you
[2:37:31] to come forward and just stand here.
[2:37:36] You want to be done with a certain
[2:37:39] rulership,
[2:37:42] something that has wrenched
[2:37:44] [Music]
[2:37:46] and stifled your spiritual victories.
[2:37:50] [Music]
[2:37:51] And I say move out from it.
[2:37:55] Do not give it any time or any more
[2:37:58] space. You've got to at one time you got
[2:38:01] to move out and take the sword in your
[2:38:04] hand and say by God's grace going to
[2:38:09] slay this thing.
[2:38:12] You have to identify it. This land is
[2:38:15] mine.
[2:38:17] This promise is mine.
[2:38:20] God, you even sent a messenger. anointed
[2:38:24] with the spirit of Elijah to tell me
[2:38:26] these things. I take them personally to
[2:38:29] my heart and soul. And now, Father,
[2:38:33] on the basis of what I have spoken, on
[2:38:37] the basis of what is written in your
[2:38:39] word, we're going to sing the song, King
[2:38:42] of My Life. I want you to make the King
[2:38:45] of Kings the King of your life that are
[2:38:48] standing here. not that you haven't done
[2:38:49] so, but in this area, in this place, in
[2:38:53] this particular place, there's nothing
[2:38:56] outside of God's knowing. God knows the
[2:38:58] beginning from the end, he knows. He's
[2:39:01] seen your struggle. He's seen your
[2:39:02] battle. He's heard your prayers. And as
[2:39:06] you stand here this evening or this
[2:39:08] morning rather, do not be silent, but
[2:39:10] let your voice be heard to by him. Oh,
[2:39:15] king of my life, let it let the world
[2:39:17] know. Let the devil know. Let the
[2:39:19] kingdoms of hell know. You will not be
[2:39:21] under. You'll not be subjected to any
[2:39:25] anyone's anyone's influence or any
[2:39:28] inferiority or anything that's tried to
[2:39:32] hold you back. Oh friends, all children
[2:39:36] of God. Oh my brothers and my sisters
[2:39:41] truly in Christ. I pray now, Father. I
[2:39:46] pray now, Father, that you'll take each
[2:39:49] one of these individually into your hand
[2:39:52] and uh cradle them to your bosom and let
[2:39:56] them know your power is their power.
[2:39:59] Your victory is their victory. As we
[2:40:03] think about Gethsemane and the cross and
[2:40:04] you said in Gethsemane, not my will but
[2:40:07] thine be done. Let our wills, oh God,
[2:40:11] let our wills be completely uh given
[2:40:14] over to you. We surrender ourselves to
[2:40:17] you. And now, Satan, you kings of the
[2:40:21] earth, you kings in the spiritual world,
[2:40:25] I come against you on the basis of the
[2:40:28] word of God, on the basis of the God of
[2:40:31] this message, the God that has sent
[2:40:34] forth a pure and holy vindication. I
[2:40:38] come on behalf of each one of these
[2:40:40] people. Father, in the name of Jesus
[2:40:42] Christ, let the power be broken.
[2:40:45] [Music]
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; Let them come into a place of such
[2:40:54] glorious victory.
[2:40:56] Those that have lacked peace, let peace
[2:40:57] come.
[2:40:59] Those that have been bound, let
[2:41:01] deliverance come. Hallelujah.
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; Satan, we slay you.
[2:41:07] We defeat you.
[2:41:09] We bind you. We cast you out. You have
[2:41:14] no right, no ownership of these people.
[2:41:18] You have no place in the sanctuary.
[2:41:23] This is not a place beside Bethl. This
[2:41:26] is Bethl, the house of God.
[2:41:29] Hallelujah.
[2:41:31] [Music]
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; Glory be to the Almighty.
[2:41:36] Glory be to the almighty God.
[2:41:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you for Calvary.
[2:41:42] Thank you, oh God, for the victory.
[2:41:45] Thank you for the blood. Thank you for
[2:41:47] the sacrifice.
[2:41:49] Oh God, we're here laboring for you and
[2:41:53] your kingdom. Oh God, let the people
[2:41:55] ride out. Let them inherit their
[2:41:58] portion. Let them inherit their portion
[2:42:02] in the name of the King of Kings, Jesus
[2:42:05] Christ. Those, oh God, in the internet,
[2:42:08] wherever they might be, let them receive
[2:42:10] their portion. May they rise,
[2:42:14] rise,
[2:42:16] ride out for victory
[2:42:19] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:42:22] You defeated enemy,
[2:42:24] &gt;&gt; your defeated, helpless enemy,
[2:42:27] &gt;&gt; defeated and helpless.
[2:42:30] We raise up the standard of victory.
[2:42:34] Glory.
[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; All who have not had victory.
[2:42:40] Declare that victory.
[2:42:42] So I take that victory.
[2:42:45] Jesus paid for it for me. Hallelujah.
[2:42:50] &gt;&gt; I claim not just something in the flesh,
[2:42:54] but we claim it in the spirit. A
[2:42:56] spiritual inheritance.
[2:42:59] a spiritual inheritance.
[2:43:02] Oh God,

[2:43:09] glory,
[2:43:12] oh God,
[2:43:15] are those that are streaming,
[2:43:18] may they enter into this moment of
[2:43:21] glorious, glorious,
[2:43:23] joyous victory.
[2:43:26] Oh God, the world's celebrating their
[2:43:28] Christmas season, but it's nothing for
[2:43:31] many to celebrate about. But we
[2:43:34] celebrate not only your birth, your
[2:43:35] death, your resurrection. We celebrate
[2:43:38] the resurrection that we have seen in
[2:43:41] this hour and the coming of the word.
[2:43:44] The coming of the word. Hallelujah.
[2:43:48] &gt;&gt; We're under the last
[2:43:51] commission. Oh God,
[2:43:54] you sent us.
[2:43:56] Thank you, Father.
[2:43:59] Thank you, Father.
[2:44:01] Father,
[2:44:03] present every life to you that's
[2:44:06] gathered around this altar and in the
[2:44:09] seats and throughout the building.

[2:44:16] streaming. Oh God, bless the Titus
[2:44:19] family in India. Oh God, bless those in
[2:44:22] Switzerland that are streaming.

[2:44:28] pray that you'll bring the same the same
[2:44:31] atmosphere, the same spirit to them and
[2:44:34] loosen, oh God, your people everywhere.
[2:44:38] Satan shall not hinder the people of God
[2:44:42] from entering in. Oh mighty God, we pray
[2:44:46] for Israel. We pray for the leadership
[2:44:48] of the people and oh God we say Lord

[2:45:24] Oh father, I commit these people. We
[2:45:27] dedicate ourselves to you. We dedicate
[2:45:30] ourselves aresh, not the man or the
[2:45:32] woman of yesterday. We dedicate
[2:45:34] ourselves as we are at this moment.
[2:45:36] We've heard your word. We've heard the
[2:45:39] scriptures. We've heard what your
[2:45:41] prophet has spoken and we believe it. We
[2:45:44] are here with the spirit of God in us.
[2:45:47] And we're born to believe.
[2:45:50] &gt;&gt; We're not born to doubt. We're born to
[2:45:52] believe.
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; We're not under king fear. We're not
[2:45:56] under these other kings. We're not under
[2:45:59] these kings that would make themselves
[2:46:01] invincible. We declare they are not
[2:46:04] invincible. Your prophet has said that
[2:46:07] this army of the living God is an
[2:46:09] invincible army.
[2:46:12] Glory,
[2:46:14] glory, glory,
[2:46:17] &gt;&gt; glory, glory,
[2:46:19] we give you praise.
[2:46:22] We give you praise. Hallelujah.
[2:46:30] Praise and worship.
[2:46:32] Yeah.
[2:46:34] King of my life I crown
[2:46:42] thy sh glory
[2:46:49] bless I forget
[2:46:52] my
[2:46:54] ground
[2:46:58] me to Bless
[2:47:06] for
[2:47:13] I forget my
[2:47:21] fore.
[2:47:32] can say this is a reality. Now, the
[2:47:35] native people on Vancouver Island had
[2:47:37] two favorite songs.
[2:47:41] One was number five.
[2:47:44] [Music]
[2:47:52] Yeah. when he reached down his hand for
[2:47:53] me. But we're going to sing the second
[2:47:55] one.
[2:47:57] I would not be denied.
[2:48:01] And they say that tears streaming down
[2:48:04] their face. Why? Because I meant every
[2:48:06] word of it. I would not be denied.
[2:48:09] You've heard the word this morning. You
[2:48:11] want to say that with everything that's
[2:48:13] within you. This is with my heart and my
[2:48:15] soul and all the energy that I have. We
[2:48:18] have a Jesus and Joshua savior. Oh, what
[2:48:22] a savior. I would not be denied. This
[2:48:25] complex is broken.
[2:48:29] This bondage is broken.
[2:48:35] &gt;&gt; Let it be more than even just an
[2:48:37] emotion. Let it be something that
[2:48:39] settles deep down in your heart. Oh God,
[2:48:42] I am his and he is mine. We've heard the
[2:48:45] word and I would not be denied.
[2:48:49] Not just a song but a truth in this song
[2:48:57] of death on my soul to the cry
[2:49:04] Jesus came and made me I would not be
[2:49:10] denied.
[2:49:12] I would not be denied.
[2:49:16] I will not be
[2:49:20] the same.
[2:49:23] I would not be
[2:49:27] I would not be denied.
[2:49:31] I would not be denied
[2:49:35] till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[2:49:39] would not be.
[2:49:42] &gt;&gt; Say it again.
[2:49:43] I would not be
[2:49:47] I would not be.
[2:49:50] &gt;&gt; Oh God Jesus came and made me
[2:49:56] not be.
[2:49:58] &gt;&gt; You might say, "I never got caught up in
[2:50:00] the song before." Well, let's break that
[2:50:02] shackle.
[2:50:04] Sing it as you never sang it before. I
[2:50:07] would not be denied. I would not be
[2:50:15] the same.
[2:50:18] I would not be.
[2:50:22] [Music]
[2:50:37] Who were you singing for that time?
[2:50:39] [Music]
[2:50:41] Think about it. Well, let's sing it
[2:50:44] once.
[2:50:46] Let's give the devil a Christmas
[2:50:47] present.
[2:50:49] We'll sing it to him. I would not be be
[2:50:54] denied. I would not be
[2:50:59] the
[2:51:01] mei.
[2:51:06] I will not be
[2:51:09] power.
[2:51:17] [Music]
[2:51:20] &gt;&gt; I'd like the people that are standing
[2:51:21] here to repeat after me.
[2:51:24] The word of God is true.
[2:51:26] &gt;&gt; The word of God is true.
[2:51:28] &gt;&gt; And Satan is defeated.
[2:51:30] &gt;&gt; And Satan is defeated.
[2:51:31] &gt;&gt; According to the word.
[2:51:33] &gt;&gt; According to the word.
[2:51:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:51:36] &gt;&gt; We give him praise.
[2:51:38] &gt;&gt; Glory, glory.
[2:51:41] Glory, glory.
[2:51:43] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:51:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:51:51] We won't give up till you sense it. Can
[2:51:54] you feel it?
[2:51:57] Glory, glory,
[2:51:59] glory, glory.
[2:52:02] Hallelujah.
[2:52:03] [Applause]
[2:52:06] Hallelujah.
[2:52:08] Hallelujah.
[2:52:10] Hallelujah. Waiting in his presence.
[2:52:12] Friend, you haven't tasted it yet.
[2:52:16] Receive it. Say, "I'm here, oh God, to
[2:52:19] receive."
[2:52:21] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm here.
[2:52:24] That's why I'm here.
[2:52:28] Heavenly Father,
[2:52:31] &gt;&gt; these are your children.
[2:52:36] It's been such a privilege to journey
[2:52:38] with them
[2:52:41] and that we have a message to preach.
[2:52:45] It's not just a positive message. That's
[2:52:47] not it. All kinds of people have
[2:52:49] positive things to say. This is a
[2:52:52] delivery message. This is a message that
[2:52:55] announces defeat to the one that was
[2:52:57] defeated. It's not enough for us to look
[2:52:59] back to Calvary and just say his head
[2:53:01] was crushed there. We say his head is
[2:53:04] crushed here. He's lost his
[2:53:06] intelligence. He's lost his voice. He
[2:53:10] has no persuasion upon the believer.
[2:53:14] Satan, we curse you to silence
[2:53:18] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:53:22] Our spiritual ears cannot hear you.
[2:53:26] To your voice we are deaf.
[2:53:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:30] &gt;&gt; And to the voice of our shepherd we are
[2:53:32] alive.
[2:53:34] &gt;&gt; My sheep hear my voice.
[2:53:36] &gt;&gt; And another they will not hear.
[2:53:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:43] &gt;&gt; Somebody needs it.
[2:53:46] &gt;&gt; Declare your victory
[2:53:48] &gt;&gt; and your glory.
[2:53:50] &gt;&gt; Get glory. Oh God.
[2:53:52] &gt;&gt; Get glory.
[2:53:54] [Music]
[2:53:56] Get glory.
[2:53:59] &gt;&gt; Somebody's praying. Oh God,
[2:54:02] &gt;&gt; somebody's in need.
[2:54:04] &gt;&gt; Somebody needs healing. Get glory. Oh
[2:54:07] God.
[2:54:09] [Music]
[2:54:09] [Applause]

[2:54:17] name.

[2:54:20] name.
[2:54:22] Bless your name. Oh my soul.
[2:54:26] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[2:54:34] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that
[2:54:36] is within me.
[2:54:40] Bless the Lord,
[2:54:43] oh my soul,
[2:54:46] and all
[2:54:48] that is within me. Glor

[2:55:12] with
[2:55:16] [Music]
[2:55:18] me.
[2:55:24] [Music]
[2:55:25] for he has

[2:55:51] beside you. Say, "God bless you."
[2:55:55] God bless you, son, daughter of God. God
[2:55:57] bless you. Amen.
[2:56:00] Hallelujah.
[2:56:01] God bless you, my dear brother. God
[2:56:03] bless you. Satan's defeated.
[2:56:09] God bless you. God bless you.
[2:56:14] We we'll just say you're dismissed in
[2:56:17] Jesus name. Come back this evening and
[2:56:20] you'll hear our brother Tom Ray.
[2:56:26] You're free in Jesus name. Hallelujah.
[2:56:31] [Music]
[2:56:41] Hallelujah.
