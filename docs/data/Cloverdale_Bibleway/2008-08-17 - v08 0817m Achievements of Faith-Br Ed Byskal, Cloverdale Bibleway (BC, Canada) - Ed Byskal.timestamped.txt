[20:44] I stand in awe within the presence of
[20:48] the Lord.
[20:51] In whom the wisdom of the ages
[20:55] lies.
[20:58] For whom the raging of the sea
[21:02] subsides.
[21:05] The living sacrifice,
[21:08] the only source of life.
[21:14] My hope, my hope is in the Lord.
[21:20] From this time on
[21:23] and ever more.
[21:26] Oh my hope
[21:30] is in the Lord
[21:33] forever more.
[21:39] [Music]
[21:46] His tender mercies come with every
[21:50] rising sun
[21:53] to beat the sin in his brokenness.
[22:00] To offer healing and forgiveness.
[22:06] And those who trust in him will find
[22:10] their hearts at rest.
[22:15] My hope, my hope is in the Lord.
[22:21] And this time on
[22:24] and forever more.
[22:27] Oh my hope
[22:30] is in the Lord.
[22:34] Forever more. Stand and sing it with us.
[22:38] Oh
[22:40] my hope, my hope is in the Lord.
[22:46] From this time on
[22:49] and ever more.
[22:52] All my hope
[22:56] is in the Lord
[22:59] forever more.
[23:02] Let's sing the first verse together.
[23:05] I stand in all within the presence of
[23:09] the Lord.
[23:12] In whom the wisdom of the aes
[23:16] lies.
[23:18] For whom the raging of the seas
[23:22] subside.
[23:24] The living sacrifice.
[23:28] The only source of life.
[23:33] My home
[23:36] is in the Lord
[23:39] from this high
[23:42] and ever
[23:48] is
[23:52] forever.
[23:56] to the second verse. His tender mercies
[24:00] come with every rising sun
[24:04] to beat the sinner in his brokenness
[24:10] to offer healing and forgiveness.
[24:16] And those who trust in him will find
[24:20] their hearts at rest.
[24:25] My home
[24:28] is in the
[24:31] time
[24:34] and
[24:38] my
[24:40] is
[24:43] forever.

[26:06] Hallelujah.
[26:08] Praise God. Isn't it wonderful?
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:13] Amen.
[26:15] You may be seated. We're going to have a
[26:19] a dedication
[26:22] of two children.
[26:24] Our sister Darlene Hildebrand
[26:27] has her children here and we're going to
[26:31] ask her to come forward.
[26:34] Yes. Jesus loves me. We're all children,
[26:37] aren't we? Amen.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:41] It's nice to start
[26:44] nice to start lives out
[26:47] so that they can sing like you do when
[26:49] they get to be your age that their hope
[26:52] is in the Lord. This is where it starts.
[26:56] Amen. This is where it begins. So, we're
[26:58] going to ask our sister Darlene if she
[27:00] will come, please. And while we're
[27:02] saying, "Yes, Jesus loves me." All
[27:04] right. Would you please? Yes.
[27:07] Jesus loves me.
[27:11] Yes,
[27:13] Jesus loves me.
[27:16] Yes,
[27:18] Jesus loves me.
[27:21] The Bible
[27:24] tells me so.
[27:27] Yes,
[27:29] Jesus loves me.
[27:32] Oh yes,
[27:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[27:39] Jesus loves me.
[27:44] [Music]
[27:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, Sister Darlene has been
[27:53] desiring to have her two daughters
[27:55] dedicated for some time and uh I was
[28:00] really blessed by the email you sent uh
[28:03] Darlene. She is uh her eldest here is
[28:08] Bethany Cila.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; So when you read in the psalm Sila, you
[28:14] can think of this one Bethany Cila. God
[28:17] bless you Bethany. And the youngest one
[28:20] is Caitlyn Sarah.
[28:23] That's wonderful.
[28:25] You gave them good names.
[28:29] I was uh mindful while I was meditating
[28:33] on the dedication of these two children
[28:37] of how God
[28:40] how how this has been uppermost in God's
[28:42] mind, how children would be raised. And
[28:45] what caused me to think about that is
[28:48] sister Darlene had sent me was going to
[28:52] send me sometimes they just send me the
[28:53] names of the children and to remind me
[28:56] that we're going to have the dedication.
[28:59] But Sister Darlene went into her
[29:01] testimony
[29:02] and in her testimony she said even in
[29:05] her lowest moments in the world
[29:08] she thought of her children.
[29:10] She thought of raising them for God. and
[29:14] in her lowest moments felt unworthy to
[29:16] do that
[29:18] and the grace of God was extended to her
[29:20] in a wonderful way and is able to stand.
[29:24] This is not a small matter, sister
[29:26] Darlene, that you're able to stand here
[29:29] on the platform today holding the hands
[29:31] of your two children
[29:33] and uh and God saw you in those moments
[29:37] and God has given you this wonderful
[29:40] opportunity. She said she noticed that
[29:43] the children, her children thrived. And
[29:47] that was the word you used and it really
[29:49] anchored in my heart. She said, "My
[29:51] girls thrived when they came to church
[29:55] under the sound of the gospel. They
[29:57] thrived." Isn't that wonderful?
[30:00] &gt;&gt; No wonder God spoke about rearing and
[30:03] bringing up the children. And even in
[30:05] the in his discussion, you imagine God
[30:08] did not speak very many moments, not too
[30:11] many minutes. I've timed it out that
[30:13] God's words that he spoke to Abraham. As
[30:16] great as that is, it is only a a few
[30:20] minutes of actual conversation that God
[30:23] had. But he did say
[30:28] when he was when he was speaking to
[30:31] Abraham
[30:33] in the form of Elohim
[30:35] which p which comes right connects to
[30:37] the ministry whereunder
[30:40] and he said shall I hide from Abraham
[30:42] the thing that I'm going to do which was
[30:44] the destruction of Sodom seeing that
[30:47] Abraham shall surely become a great
[30:49] nation a mighty nation and all the
[30:51] nations of the earth will be blessed by
[30:53] him.
[30:55] And here's his next line. For I know
[30:58] that he will command his children and
[31:01] his household after him.
[31:04] I thought that was amazing.
[31:07] So, so upfront to this great promise of
[31:12] God to Abraham was how he would raise
[31:15] his children. And so God put that in
[31:18] your heart,
[31:20] Sister Darlene. And in so doing, you're
[31:23] not only raising them right, but you're
[31:26] protecting them. And if you love these
[31:28] children, which you do very deeply
[31:30] by having them here and the sound of the
[31:33] gospel, letting them come under the
[31:35] atmosphere of the Holy Spirit, you're
[31:37] actually protecting them against many
[31:41] hurts and many evil things, and you're
[31:43] protecting them. And God bless you as a
[31:46] mother as you do that. and to have your
[31:48] mother here and is uh a special blessing
[31:54] our brother
[31:55] Nathan Hilda Brand who takes these as
[31:58] his children. God bless you. Um in
[32:03] brother Brandham's last service, this is
[32:06] his last service before God took him
[32:10] which was leadership.
[32:13] And he prayed a prayer and he included
[32:16] the children
[32:18] and he made this reference. He said,
[32:19] "Dear Jesus, one day in your pilgrimage
[32:22] here on earth, they brought you such
[32:25] little fellows." He had some with him in
[32:28] the church. This is his last service.
[32:30] And he's taking time to
[32:33] to deal with this. And he says, uh, they
[32:36] brought such little fellows as I have
[32:38] been speaking to this afternoon.
[32:41] And the disciples said, "The master is
[32:43] too tired. He's been preaching and this
[32:47] morning and he he preached this and that
[32:49] and he's too tired. Don't trouble him."
[32:52] But Jesus said, "Suffer the little
[32:54] children to come to me for such is the
[32:57] kingdom of heaven." And he continues on
[32:59] with this prayer. I want to go to the
[33:01] end of it. He says, "Oh dear God,
[33:04] creator of heavens and earth, guide our
[33:06] feet,
[33:08] Lord, that we'll do we'll not do nothing
[33:12] before these little ones that would put
[33:14] a stumbling block in their way.
[33:17] For it is said it'd be better if we had
[33:19] a millstone tied around our neck and
[33:22] cast into the sea than to offend one of
[33:25] these little ones." That's what God
[33:26] thinks about them.
[33:28] And he said, "They're angels always.
[33:30] Behold my father's face which is in
[33:32] heaven, the great angel and guardian
[33:35] angel over each of these little souls.
[33:39] And then at the end of his prayer, he
[33:41] said this.
[33:43] Oh Jehovah God, lead them,
[33:47] protect them, and may they find this
[33:50] great leader,
[33:53] Jesus Christ, that will lead them when
[33:56] father and mother and the teachers are
[33:58] finished
[34:00] with them. May you lead them to eternal
[34:03] life.
[34:05] He said, "I
[34:08] you did to Moses as their humble little
[34:11] child prayer went to you. I give them to
[34:14] you, Lord, as your servants, as trophies
[34:17] and gems for your crown. Use them, Lord,
[34:21] to honor you on the earth in Jesus
[34:24] Christ's name." And that's the prayer
[34:26] I'm going to pray that God will take
[34:29] these little gems. Come to me, Bethany.
[34:34] I know all about girls.
[34:39] Let's pray together.
[34:41] Lord Jesus,
[34:43] I lay my hands upon these blessed
[34:46] children.
[34:48] I pray, Father, that Bethany and Caitlyn
[34:52] will be not always not only always in
[34:56] your care, but hold them in your hand.
[34:59] Put your arms about them. And as the
[35:02] prophet of God prayed, I pray I echo
[35:04] that prayer. Be their guide.
[35:08] After they've grown and perhaps if time
[35:10] shall go on and and mother or
[35:12] grandparents aren't with them, be their
[35:15] guide. When they're alone, you watch
[35:17] over them. Keep them in health, I pray.
[35:20] Keep evil away from them. Keep them from
[35:23] the snares. Keep them from the pitfalls.
[35:25] Keep them, I pray, so their lives will
[35:28] be a testimony of the grace of our Lord
[35:31] Jesus Christ. I dedicate Bethany and
[35:34] Caitlyn to you in the name of the Lord
[35:37] Jesus Christ. Father, that they might
[35:40] always walk in your ways and walk in
[35:42] truth. And may they always thrive in the
[35:46] presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. May
[35:49] they be a blessing, I pray, to other
[35:52] children, Lord. And I ask, Father, that
[35:55] your love, your love, oh God, will be
[35:58] extended to them in abundant measure in
[36:02] Jesus name. Amen.
[36:06] God bless you, Sister Darlene. Give you
[36:08] wisdom and strength.
[36:12] Amen. Isn't
[36:13] &gt;&gt; that wonderful?
[36:17] It is uh it was just really nice to see
[36:22] and I haven't had an opportunity to even
[36:23] shake hands with our our brother Gilbert
[36:27] and I'm looking for them. I saw them on
[36:29] the brother Gilbert, sister Lois,
[36:34] God bless you.
[36:36] Welcome in the name of the Lord Jesus
[36:38] Christ. We are so happy to have you.
[36:42] These people have come a long ways.
[36:45] A long ways. Some people travel across
[36:47] the continent and some people travel
[36:49] across seas. But our brother Gilbert and
[36:52] Citra Lois, which originally came from
[36:56] Kenya and have been working in Saudi
[36:59] Arabia
[37:01] and uh
[37:03] last year we prayed for a couple that
[37:06] were they were at the convention
[37:10] 207 convention and on the way home they
[37:14] stopped at Nairobi, Kenya which is their
[37:18] city
[37:20] where they came from originally
[37:22] and took a taxi and the taxi hijacked
[37:27] them,
[37:29] took them out, robbed them of absolutely
[37:32] everything and they thought that their
[37:35] life would surely end there. And I
[37:38] believe if I have it right, Sister Lois,
[37:41] the these men
[37:45] either asked you to leave the car or
[37:47] asked you to leave the car and she
[37:50] feared then she said, "No, my children
[37:52] will go with me." And they said, "No,
[37:54] you get out." And she was certain that
[37:58] she would be killed and or the children
[38:01] some harm's going to come to them. And
[38:03] she took them quickly out of the car
[38:05] with you, didn't you? and and they were
[38:08] spared but were left with nothing. We
[38:13] respect that that you came and your
[38:16] former pastor brother Obadiah
[38:19] Kamwati told me of of something of the
[38:22] thing that he knew. We're happy to have
[38:24] this couple once again. I want you and
[38:26] the family to rise so that everyone can
[38:28] see this is a couple that under great
[38:31] duress have come now to dwell with us
[38:34] and have the children in school. God
[38:36] bless you brother.
[38:44] That's believers
[38:47] &gt;&gt; and we're so happy. We need believers.
[38:51] We need believers who can have faith and
[38:53] who can pray. Amen.
[38:59] All right, Sister uh yes, Sister
[39:03] Donaldson, Sister Brother Derek
[39:05] Donaldson, pastor in in New Zealand,
[39:10] uh is here with us, has been here a
[39:12] couple weeks, but has been out at the
[39:15] out at the camp. And so I just got to
[39:17] shake. Sister Donaldson, could you just
[39:19] stand? We we so love your husband's
[39:22] ministry. God bless you.
[39:27] Amen.
[39:30] Well, I'm going to have you stand once
[39:32] again now, Brother Rod. If you can help
[39:34] me because of the message and to put us
[39:37] in the theme, I have a couple of songs,
[39:40] but I want to sing a verse or two of my
[39:42] faith looks up to thee. I want to speak
[39:45] this morning, Lord willing, and with the
[39:48] help of the Holy Spirit and with you
[39:50] saying amen. And I read about amen.
[39:55] You know, it was a custom. They would
[39:57] say amen before the reading and amen
[40:00] after the reading.
[40:02] It was like saying shalom
[40:05] when you meet somebody and shalom when
[40:07] you leave. So, we're saying amen before
[40:10] the service, before the reading, and
[40:13] we're saying amen after the service, and
[40:16] anywhere in between.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because it would you it's an
[40:20] acknowledgment and it is actually saying
[40:23] I am saying amen let it be let it be a
[40:27] part of me let that which has been
[40:29] spoken be a part of me amen so be it
[40:33] hallelujah my faith looks up to thee
[40:35] thou lamb of Calvary
[40:39] faith looks up to thee
[40:44] th
[40:45] lamb of calary
[40:50] Savior

[42:02] Nearer,
[42:04] Nearer because uh I'm not singing for
[42:07] you to put you in the atmosphere. This
[42:09] been on these songs have been on my
[42:11] heart since very early this morning. And
[42:14] I've just been singing them to the Lord.
[42:17] And I love these words. I am thine, O
[42:19] Lord.
[42:21] [Music]
[42:23] How many want to join me?
[42:26] &gt;&gt; I am thine, O Lord.
[42:28] How many want to join me the next line?
[42:30] I've heard thy voice.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:35] I've heard thy voice
[42:37] and it told thy love to me.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; I say amen.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; So be it. That's been the truth of God's
[42:46] word. Sing it with me. And just this
[42:49] verse and one chorus.
[42:51] I am thy Lord.
[42:56] I have heard thy voice and it's full thy
[43:04] love to me.
[43:07] [Music]
[43:10] I long to rise in the arms of faith
[43:19] and be closer
[43:22] from to thee.
[43:27] Oh, draw me nearer,
[43:31] nearer,
[43:33] nearer. Blessed
[43:37] to the cross where I
[43:42] die.
[43:46] Draw me nearer,
[43:49] nearer,
[43:51] nearer. Blessed Lord
[43:57] to thy preious.
[43:59] [Music]
[44:05] Our dear gracious heavenly father,
[44:08] we love and thank you for these words
[44:11] that we believe has been inspired by the
[44:13] Holy Spirit
[44:15] and people who've been inspired and as
[44:18] your prophet has said, all inspiration
[44:19] has come from you. But the so much of it
[44:23] is so perverted. But this is pure and it
[44:27] speaks to our hearts, Lord. Oh God, oh
[44:30] God, I am thine, oh Lord, and I've heard
[44:34] thy voice and it told thy love to me.
[44:37] But I long to rise in the arms of faith
[44:40] and be closer drawn to thee. This is our
[44:44] desire. This is our prayer, especially
[44:46] in this hour in which we are living.
[44:49] You've called on us, oh God, to stand
[44:52] and to be an expression, to be a
[44:54] witness. I pray, Father, as your word
[44:58] lays before me, open that it may indeed
[45:01] be open. Open, I pray, to each that are
[45:06] here, oh God. And I pray that you will
[45:09] uh just encompass us by your presence
[45:13] and your nearness and do what is
[45:15] pleasing to you. We give ourselves
[45:20] un unreservedly to you Lord. Take us,
[45:24] cleanse us, give us a clean heart. Give
[45:27] us clean thoughts. Oh God, let us draw
[45:30] into your presence. Oh God, we come
[45:32] humbly. We come seeking your face. Lord,
[45:36] we come seeking, oh God, your
[45:37] forgiveness for anything that wrong we
[45:40] have done. Oh God, we pray that you will
[45:43] do mighty things amongst us and put us
[45:46] in position and in condition, oh God, to
[45:49] receive this morning from you. Anoint
[45:51] the people, I pray. Anoint the speaker,
[45:54] oh God, according to your word. And all
[45:56] those who are connected with us and are
[45:59] one with us now streaming the service.
[46:02] Bless them wherever they may be in the
[46:04] world. I ask in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[46:08] God bless you. If you'll take your
[46:11] Bible, please, I'd like to have you turn
[46:14] to Hebrews, the 11th chapter for a a
[46:19] reading of just the first six verses of
[46:21] Hebrews 11.
[46:24] I would just ask you earnestly, I covet
[46:28] your prayers this coming week. Uh my
[46:31] wife and I will be going to brother uh
[46:35] Jose Joe Greens, brother Joseph Green.
[46:38] He is now the pastor where brother Dan
[46:41] Daisley was. And I thought I should just
[46:43] tell tell you this. I feel very much to
[46:47] be at home with the family this morning.
[46:50] And I'm going to just speak to you that
[46:52] way. But when brother Dan Daisley passed
[46:56] away,
[46:58] I held it in my heart for a few days.
[47:00] But the Lord spoke to me and said,
[47:03] "They're going to call you and ask you
[47:04] to come and speak these meetings."
[47:07] And there was no pastor at that time.
[47:10] Brother Dan had just passed away a very
[47:13] very short time. And so I just waited.
[47:17] And then after
[47:19] actually it was a maybe a couple of
[47:21] months or two or three months. Then I
[47:24] got a phone call from brother Joseph
[47:26] Green. They had asked him to take the
[47:30] uh pa the position of pastor in the
[47:33] church. And then it was sometime after
[47:35] that that he called and said, 'We'd like
[47:38] you to have come and take the services
[47:41] for this mission mission convention
[47:43] they've had every year for many years.
[47:46] And I have spoken there when brother
[47:48] Henry Green was the pastor and then he
[47:51] passed away and brother Dan Daisley
[47:53] became the pastor and now he has passed
[47:55] away and brother brother Henry Green's
[47:58] son now that's Joseph and he has become
[48:01] the pastor and then when he called I
[48:04] said I would I felt it so strong in my
[48:06] heart and then I discovered they were
[48:09] having it the same week as our camp and
[48:12] I was in a terrible terrible position.
[48:15] So I phoned them back or told them I
[48:17] couldn't come and if they had it at a
[48:20] different time. And yet I had this in my
[48:22] heart that they would ask me and I would
[48:25] be there. And so they postponed it. But
[48:28] they've had it the first week of August
[48:30] for maybe 30 years. And now they so they
[48:33] put it so I would be able to be with
[48:36] them. And I don't know what the Lord has
[48:38] in store whether for them or for myself.
[48:42] But uh I just go
[48:45] trusting and believing that God has made
[48:47] these arrangements. So I have a number
[48:49] of services to speak and then on to
[48:51] brother uh brother Ron Spencer's for
[48:54] three services. So you pray for me. I
[48:58] need strength. I need wisdom. I need
[49:01] the presence of the Holy Spirit. I
[49:03] depend on him. But we've got seven
[49:05] services in the next two weeks.
[49:10] God bless us this morning.
[49:12] I so enjoyed the service before we went
[49:14] to the camp and I have seen the effects
[49:17] of the camp friends. Uh the effects of
[49:20] the camp are here this morning.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; And we're thankful to God
[49:25] &gt;&gt; for his eternal work.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:30] Now faith is the substance of things
[49:32] hoped for, the evidence of things not
[49:35] seen. For by it the elders obtained a
[49:39] good report. Through faith we understand
[49:42] that the worlds were framed by the word
[49:44] of God, so that things which are seen
[49:47] were not made of things which do appear.
[49:50] By faith Abel offered unto God a more
[49:54] excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which
[49:57] he obtained witness that he was
[49:59] righteous, God testifying of his gifts,
[50:03] and by it he being dead yet speaketh. By
[50:07] faith, Enoch was translated that he
[50:10] should not see death and was not found
[50:13] because God had translated him.
[50:17] For before his translation, he had this
[50:21] testimony that he pleased God. But
[50:24] without faith, it is impossible to
[50:26] please him. For he that cometh to God
[50:30] must believe that he is, and that he is
[50:33] a rewarder of them that diligently seek
[50:35] him. May God bless his word to us. You
[50:38] may be seated.
[50:45] The scriptures are are
[50:48] infallible and the scriptures are
[50:50] wonderfully put together.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Even in the reading of these six verses,
[50:58] the first one that makes reference to
[51:00] faith is able.
[51:03] And he was the he was the first one that
[51:07] whose life was taken, but he was a type
[51:10] of Christ.
[51:12] The scripture speaks of the blood of
[51:14] Christ that speaks better things than
[51:15] that of Abel. Isn't it amazing that it
[51:19] says by faith Abel? And then the very
[51:21] next one is Enoch, who's our type.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; That's going right from the beginning to
[51:27] the end in two verses.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; I thought that was really, really
[51:31] remarkable.
[51:32] And by faith Enoch was translated.
[51:36] I want to uh speak to you on
[51:40] the achievements of faith.
[51:44] The achievements
[51:46] of faith in the message perfect faith.
[51:51] And I'm just giving this as a as a
[51:53] starting point. Brother Brandham said
[51:56] faith is based on forgiveness.
[52:02] And then as as we said this morning,
[52:05] trying to get the church Oh, here's
[52:07] brother Brandham trying to get the
[52:10] church into the place to where we could
[52:13] really see apostolic times moving
[52:17] amongst us.
[52:20] I'm not reading that so much for you as
[52:22] I'm reading it for myself.
[52:24] I have a great hunger. I told God this
[52:28] morning early early in the morning and
[52:32] throughout even to this time, I have a
[52:35] great hunger to see days that many of
[52:38] you have never seen, apostolic times
[52:42] again. And here is the prophet of God
[52:45] with the things that his church saw,
[52:48] with the things that Brandham Tabernacle
[52:51] experienced. and he is still having a
[52:54] craving that they would see apostolic
[52:58] times again. We don't want to just
[53:01] merely be hearers of the word and we can
[53:04] have wonderful services and wonderful
[53:06] preaching. We want it to go beyond
[53:09] preaching. We want it to come down into
[53:13] reality within our hearts and within the
[53:16] congregation and within our homes
[53:19] wherever it might be. the supernatural
[53:22] God doing supernatural things. And then
[53:25] he went on to say that they may see
[53:27] apostolic times moving amongst us. He
[53:30] said, "That's what we all hunger." I
[53:33] said, "Oh God, I had not read this, but
[53:36] I was in prayer before I even got out of
[53:38] bed this morning. I have a hunger, Lord.
[53:41] I have a hunger to see you move and take
[53:45] control of the of our services. Take
[53:48] control of our lives. Take control of
[53:51] our home and our bodies and our whole
[53:54] being. Take control.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; He may want to do something you've never
[53:58] even experienced yet.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Let him have his way.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Say, "Come, oh Holy Spirit."
[54:07] &gt;&gt; And my next prayer was create in me a
[54:09] clean heart.
[54:11] We have things, we have issues, we have
[54:14] thoughts, we have feelings. And faith
[54:17] can't operate with some of those. It
[54:19] won't coexist
[54:21] with another spirit. Even brother
[54:23] Brandham is saying here, faith is based
[54:26] on forgiveness.
[54:27] If we hold anything in our heart, God
[54:31] will not move. Faith will not operate.
[54:36] It is based on forgiveness. We have to
[54:38] receive forgiveness and we have to give
[54:41] forgiveness.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's what we hunger
[54:45] for." And he said, "Furthermore, it's
[54:48] just laying at the door." I announced to
[54:52] the congregation this morning, it's just
[54:54] laying at the door. It's not far away.
[54:57] It's just laying at the door. He said,
[55:01] "We see it, but we want to see more of
[55:04] it.
[55:06] We want it in such a flow that it'll be
[55:09] a help to us and flow out to others.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; You know, I feel that we have heard
[55:18] enough already
[55:20] &gt;&gt; if we acted upon that.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; That would be a big step.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Let's resolve in our heart. Let's say in
[55:28] our heart, let's dedicate ourselves. We
[55:30] just dedicated two children, but let's
[55:32] all be children this morning. Let's all
[55:35] be children. Let's all just say, "Oh
[55:37] God, empty me out.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Whatever there may be that you can use,
[55:43] take it and use it for your glory.
[55:48] There have been many achievements in the
[55:51] world.
[55:54] And throughout history, there's been a
[55:57] lot of achievements.
[55:58] And some have changed the world for the
[56:00] better.
[56:03] Others have faded away and aren't
[56:07] remembered anymore. I suppose one day
[56:09] the steam engine was a great
[56:11] achievement, but it's not it's not
[56:14] relevant anymore. Maybe one day the
[56:17] horse harness was really something that,
[56:20] you know, would work and get uh animals,
[56:25] domesticated animals to work and serve.
[56:27] But it's not relevant anymore. It's gone
[56:30] the way of the horse hornness, gone the
[56:32] way of the steam engine, some of these
[56:34] things. And so they're great
[56:35] achievements for the time. Then other
[56:37] great achievements have uh really
[56:41] changed things and in that they have
[56:43] been built upon. And brother Brandham
[56:45] speaks about that. There's been
[56:47] scientific achievements that have
[56:49] advanced civilization and they are
[56:52] remembered. Now, brother Brandham states
[56:54] that the advancement of civilization
[56:58] and man's achievements, listen closely,
[57:02] are directly connected to what God is
[57:06] doing in his churchise.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; It's not just some poetic license. It's
[57:12] it's kind of like it. He said they're
[57:14] connected to it.
[57:17] in the message countdown
[57:19] he said and I'm just laying this as a
[57:21] fundamental basis for everything else I
[57:24] wish to say this morning he said
[57:26] everything testifies
[57:29] all nature testifies
[57:32] the word testifies to it the very spirit
[57:35] itself that's in our heart testifies to
[57:37] it something within us is calling out
[57:40] that there is a resurrection of the dead
[57:43] that's what he's pointing to then he
[57:46] said there is a natural body and there
[57:48] is a spiritual body of of people.
[57:52] There's a natural bride
[57:54] and being that there is a natural bride,
[57:57] it's only a testimony that there's a
[57:59] spiritual bride.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Oh my, the natural brides, it's
[58:03] important. We have all kinds of things
[58:06] that take place. and with sister Katie
[58:08] and brother Michael and their week. I'm
[58:10] sure no one has to remind us that their
[58:13] week's going to be a busy week and the
[58:15] family's going to be busy and all this.
[58:17] They're all What are they doing? Getting
[58:19] ready.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; And that's just for time. That's just
[58:25] for a brief moment of time. What about
[58:30] where you're headed
[58:31] &gt;&gt; as a spiritual bride?
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What about that wedding?
[58:36] that's taken place now taking place
[58:39] getting ready for the marriage supper.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; It's only a testimony of a spiritual
[58:44] bride and there is a spiritual bride
[58:46] because there is a natural bride.
[58:51] All these natural happenings
[58:56] they forerun spiritual happenings.
[59:00] Each happening accompanies the other
[59:03] happening only it improves it.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; You say what what like? He said well
[59:10] something like a spiritual life when it
[59:13] comes into the natural life. We all are
[59:15] here with a natural life. I think the
[59:18] reason you're here is because you've had
[59:19] a spiritual life come into the natural
[59:22] life. And what does he say about that?
[59:24] He said it comes into the natural life
[59:26] and it makes you in a better condition
[59:29] &gt;&gt; than you wear in your natural life.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; So it has spiritual life has come in and
[59:35] it makes us in a better condition. If it
[59:38] hasn't, I'd give it up.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Here I have this underlined.
[59:46] All the natural achievements
[59:49] that's happened in the earth has been
[59:52] forerunners of spiritual achievements
[59:56] that God has done by his church. All the
[1:00:00] natural things are types of the
[1:00:03] spiritual things.
[1:00:05] all the natural things. And one place
[1:00:08] I'm going to read a little later on, he
[1:00:10] said they're actually warnings. The
[1:00:13] natural achievements,
[1:00:15] scientific achievements are actual
[1:00:17] warnings or they're signals or their
[1:00:19] alerts that something spiritual is on
[1:00:23] the road.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; This is
[1:00:30] this is probably worth mentioning.
[1:00:34] They say that not a single human being
[1:00:37] had ever flown a powered aircraft when
[1:00:40] the 20th century began.
[1:00:43] Hey, people been on the earth for few
[1:00:46] thousand years that we know of and no
[1:00:49] one until the 20th century
[1:00:52] had flown. The first piloted powered
[1:00:56] controlled flight lasted 12 seconds.
[1:01:00] You wouldn't even get to the end of the
[1:01:02] runway. Now, it lasted 12 seconds and
[1:01:06] carried one man 120 ft.
[1:01:10] Today, non-stop commercial flights
[1:01:12] lasting as long as 15 hours carry
[1:01:15] hundreds of passengers halfway around
[1:01:17] the world. I'm sure if you've flown on
[1:01:20] some of these big beasts, you've had the
[1:01:22] same feeling. I I've I've looked at that
[1:01:24] luggage going in, and I feel like the
[1:01:27] little woman that threw her apron in the
[1:01:28] air when the first steam engine train
[1:01:31] started moving down the tracks. She
[1:01:32] said, "It'll never go. It'll never go."
[1:01:34] And when it got started, she threw her
[1:01:36] apron in the air again and said, "It'll
[1:01:38] never stop. It'll never stop." And I
[1:01:40] feel like that little woman, because I
[1:01:42] see all that baggage, I look at my wife
[1:01:43] and I say, "This thing's never going to
[1:01:45] get off the ground." And it gets off the
[1:01:47] ground, then I worry that it'll land
[1:01:49] safely
[1:01:50] because uh that's just
[1:01:53] I I look at all those rivets in the Ever
[1:01:56] looked at those rivets in the wing. Say,
[1:01:59] "I hope those things stay in place. Do
[1:02:02] you ever watch the wings go like this?
[1:02:04] Said, "This thing's flapping just like a
[1:02:06] great big eagle." And I hope it just
[1:02:08] stays up here. Well, pray first. We got
[1:02:11] to be on one tomorrow. And I got to
[1:02:14] think about this. The first man in the
[1:02:16] 20th century, what about all the other
[1:02:18] centuries? Weren't they smart back then?
[1:02:20] Of course they were. This was the signal
[1:02:25] because the church was moving and was
[1:02:27] directly connected what God was doing in
[1:02:30] the church. Why didn't they have this in
[1:02:32] the Old Testament? Because the church
[1:02:33] was not moving at that level in the Old
[1:02:36] Testament.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; You have to you have to conclude that.
[1:02:40] Listen to the telephone. The telephone.
[1:02:43] I hope you don't have your cell phones
[1:02:45] turned off. In 1877, which isn't that
[1:02:48] long ago, Alexander Graham Bell, he
[1:02:50] wrote a prospectus.
[1:02:53] He wrote a prospectus to drum up support
[1:02:55] for his new invention.
[1:02:58] And the telephone was was to be briefly
[1:03:00] described as an electrical and this was
[1:03:03] his this was his explanation. The
[1:03:06] telephone is to be uh briefly described
[1:03:10] as a an electrical contrivance for re
[1:03:13] reproducing in distant places the tones
[1:03:16] and articulations of a speaker's voice.
[1:03:20] As for connecting one such contrivance
[1:03:23] to another, he suggested possibilities
[1:03:27] that admittedly sounded utopian.
[1:03:31] This is he said it is conceivable that
[1:03:33] cables of telephone wires could be laid
[1:03:37] underground or suspended overhead
[1:03:40] communicating by branch wires with
[1:03:43] private dwellings,
[1:03:45] country houses, shops and factories,
[1:03:48] etc. that could even possibly happen.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Hey, we've only gone a little overund
[1:03:55] and some years
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; in a hundred years. Why wasn't this
[1:03:59] happening when Elijah was here?
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; You know, you need to ask yourself that.
[1:04:04] It's just not an accident.
[1:04:08] It came in this hour because there was
[1:04:11] something God allowed it to take place
[1:04:14] in the natural because there was
[1:04:16] something to take place in the spiritual
[1:04:18] realm.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; And just one more and that is our
[1:04:22] research in space. In our daily life, we
[1:04:26] are literally a wash in a shifting tide
[1:04:29] of signals, frequencies and codes. Our
[1:04:33] eyes
[1:04:35] and ears can receive some small part of
[1:04:39] these and pass them along to our brains
[1:04:42] for interpretation.
[1:04:44] But what of the rest of those signals
[1:04:47] which reach us and even pass through our
[1:04:50] very bodies on a level which the flesh
[1:04:54] is not sensitive enough to detect
[1:04:57] unaded. Do you know that back I think in
[1:05:01] the 1950s
[1:05:04] the prophet of God said that these
[1:05:06] signals pass right through our bodies.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; How could he say that? Because he was
[1:05:14] connected to a science these fellas
[1:05:16] hadn't even discovered yet.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; He was connected to a mind that wasn't
[1:05:21] even discovered as yet because it was a
[1:05:23] time. It was an era. He said that these
[1:05:26] signals they're passing through your
[1:05:27] body right now.
[1:05:30] And the prophet of God said there's
[1:05:32] there's images passing through here. He
[1:05:34] said bodies are passing through here. If
[1:05:36] you had the instrument, it would pick it
[1:05:38] up. The television camera doesn't
[1:05:40] produce it. It only produces and and and
[1:05:44] brings a signal so that you can you can
[1:05:46] see what is happening. Colors are going
[1:05:48] through.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Colors are going through here right now.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Your birthmark is going through here. if
[1:05:56] it if you catch it.
[1:06:00] Is that strange?
[1:06:02] Not a bit.
[1:06:05] And so the theme of the countdown
[1:06:07] message is based on comparing the
[1:06:10] achievement in science to the spiritual
[1:06:12] advancement.
[1:06:14] And so in the just a little bit on on in
[1:06:17] the countdown message,
[1:06:20] it just talks about the horse and the
[1:06:21] buggy and the transportation and the
[1:06:24] right brothers, etc. I won't read that.
[1:06:26] But he said, "One happening accompanies
[1:06:28] the other happening all the time." He
[1:06:32] said, "Now don't fail to get this." And
[1:06:34] so I'd like the congregation this
[1:06:36] morning, don't fail to get this.
[1:06:40] Open up ears, heart, and everything now.
[1:06:42] And listen close. When anything happens
[1:06:46] on earth, it's a warning to us that
[1:06:50] something is fixing to happen from
[1:06:52] heaven. Amen.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; What man does on earth by his
[1:06:56] achievement is something that God's
[1:06:59] fixing to do by his achievement in the
[1:07:03] church.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; God has been able in the spiritual line
[1:07:10] to achieve from justification and he
[1:07:13] goes on now from justification through
[1:07:16] Luther and sanctification through Wesley
[1:07:19] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now
[1:07:22] it's a type of shadow achievement what
[1:07:24] God has been able to do and by God by
[1:07:28] Luther with the Holy Spirit power was
[1:07:30] able to achieve by Luther to the church
[1:07:34] justification. Isn't that a glorious
[1:07:36] truth?
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Wasn't that a marvelous achievement?
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Lu Luther's not down in the annals of uh
[1:07:42] of science and scientific uh uh
[1:07:45] development, but he's down in God's
[1:07:48] records. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; He's a messenger in God's records. And
[1:07:53] he achieved a a message to the people, a
[1:07:56] great achievement by the power of the
[1:07:58] Holy Spirit. The just shall live by
[1:08:00] faith,
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; not by works. How wonderful that was
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; for the multitudes of people who came
[1:08:07] out of all of that works and trying to
[1:08:10] be righteous and holy and it's not
[1:08:12] possible. And so God moved the church
[1:08:15] up. And then when the church got
[1:08:18] justification out of the Roman creeds,
[1:08:21] it began to get life and begin to move
[1:08:23] through justification. God was able to
[1:08:25] do through his achievement to get one
[1:08:28] man to stand still long enough that he
[1:08:32] could protect him or project himself to
[1:08:35] it and get his message to the people.
[1:08:37] The next achievement he said God was
[1:08:40] able to do. He got a man by John Wesley.
[1:08:44] And then he goes on to sanctification,
[1:08:47] these achievements. And then he says
[1:08:49] there came an Isuza Street where they
[1:08:52] left the ground and and and and hit the
[1:08:55] air through the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:58] Ghost. These are achievements and they
[1:09:01] could only happen in this hour because
[1:09:04] it was a natural achievements were
[1:09:06] taking place and they're working in in
[1:09:09] concert with one another. They're
[1:09:11] connected to one another. And then he
[1:09:13] goes on, he said, "The same horsepower
[1:09:16] that can pulse the horse
[1:09:20] did the same thing to the automobile and
[1:09:23] did the same thing to the airplane. And
[1:09:26] the same Holy Ghost that brought
[1:09:27] justification to the church, it brought
[1:09:30] more of it when it brought
[1:09:32] sanctification
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; and the and it poured it in with the
[1:09:36] Holy Ghost till the same power. It
[1:09:39] brought the same thing. It took the
[1:09:42] church off it off its feet into the
[1:09:44] heavenlies.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; The same power
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; just more of it.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Building on what was there.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; The message today is built on
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; what God has achieved in the past.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; It's not something they threw that away
[1:10:00] and then just start something all new.
[1:10:02] It's built on. It's advancing the It's
[1:10:04] the same power that's been in the church
[1:10:07] only. It's advancing in its stages.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Said now things has changed altogether
[1:10:15] because science is moving on. Things
[1:10:17] have changed altogether. Then as you
[1:10:19] know he talks about the astronauts and
[1:10:22] he said well they talk about astronauts
[1:10:24] in this day in the 20th century but we
[1:10:26] had astronauts in the scripture. Enoch
[1:10:29] was an astronaut. Elijah was an
[1:10:31] astronaut. Jesus was an astronaut. Why?
[1:10:34] They simply went into space.
[1:10:37] Why should that be so strange? Hey, God,
[1:10:40] he doesn't need he doesn't need a a a
[1:10:42] tube of of metal around him
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; or around his people.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; And so these are these are true uh
[1:10:50] achievements which took place. But then
[1:10:52] he said this this is astronaut age. Oh,
[1:10:57] what a great thing.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; The horse and buggy was earthbound.
[1:11:03] But now we are in an astronaut age and
[1:11:07] so has the church. He said that's that's
[1:11:11] the big swing over that I can't get
[1:11:15] before the people.
[1:11:19] That's the big swing from that one age
[1:11:23] to get them into into this mind into
[1:11:27] this thought into this development into
[1:11:30] this achievement. Friends, we don't want
[1:11:32] to be earthbound.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be so attached to this
[1:11:37] earth that we can't get heavenly bound.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; I want you to listen close.
[1:11:46] Now, that's a form of evolution.
[1:11:49] Listen very, very close because I got
[1:11:52] some preaching to do. The true message
[1:11:55] of evolution
[1:11:57] I'm talk the true message of evolution.
[1:12:01] Evolution is gradual development.
[1:12:05] Brother Brandon says one moved to the
[1:12:08] other. It was just more of the same.
[1:12:11] More horsepower, more Holy Ghost power,
[1:12:14] revelation but more revelation.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost but more of the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:21] The presence of God, but more of the
[1:12:23] presence of God. The word, but more of
[1:12:26] the word.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Supernatural things, but
[1:12:30] more supernatural things. That way, we
[1:12:32] don't want to settle back. We want to
[1:12:34] move on forward.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm depending on you,
[1:12:38] and you have to depend on on someone
[1:12:40] else. We're depending on one another.
[1:12:42] Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; And so in we have a we have uh evolution
[1:12:47] in in creation into higher forms of
[1:12:51] life. Now we do not believe in evolution
[1:12:55] of the species but we believe in
[1:12:58] evolution of the creation of the
[1:13:00] species. Brother Brown said he began to
[1:13:03] create the lower forms of life and then
[1:13:05] he built up higher and higher and
[1:13:07] higher. He didn't do away with the lower
[1:13:09] things to get to the higher things. It
[1:13:11] was just more of the same creation.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; So, we don't agree with Darwin, of
[1:13:16] course,
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; not a He said, "If there was," Well, I
[1:13:20] got it here in a moment. He said, "If
[1:13:22] there was, then why why has there never
[1:13:25] been anything get higher than man?"
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; If everything just developed to us,
[1:13:30] Brother Brandham says, "I got one for
[1:13:32] them."
[1:13:33] I'd like to ask why has there never been
[1:13:35] any any indication through all of their
[1:13:39] evolution theory that something evolved
[1:13:43] higher than man? He said the reason why
[1:13:45] it can't be because man is in the image
[1:13:47] of God
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; and it can't get any higher. And that
[1:13:51] defeats their own doctrine,
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; their own theory. They call it a theory.
[1:13:55] It's more than a theory. They try to
[1:13:57] teach it like a doctrine. And they won't
[1:13:59] let you bring the Bible into the school,
[1:14:01] but they'll teach Darwinism and say,
[1:14:03] "Well, it's just a theory." Well,
[1:14:05] someone else said, "Why don't we just
[1:14:06] teach this as a theory then?" The theory
[1:14:08] of creation, not the theory of the ele
[1:14:12] evolution of the species, but the
[1:14:16] evolution of the creation of the
[1:14:18] species. Yes. Amen.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; And we believe in the evolution which is
[1:14:25] the gradual development in revelation of
[1:14:29] greater truth. We believe in the
[1:14:31] evolution of the building of the bride
[1:14:33] body of Jesus Christ. Prophet of God. It
[1:14:36] shows clearly in the scriptures also
[1:14:39] that it grew from you know just from the
[1:14:41] from the feet all the way up and now
[1:14:43] come to a head age.
[1:14:46] So now we're we're not in the uh I just
[1:14:49] got a couple of quotes I'd like to make
[1:14:51] in the message demonology said I believe
[1:14:53] in the right kind of evolution
[1:14:56] in the present stage of my ministry said
[1:14:57] I believe in evolution but not the way
[1:14:59] that man evoluted from some lower
[1:15:02] species. Their own theory backfires upon
[1:15:06] them when they try to hybrid anything.
[1:15:09] even when they try to, you know, bring a
[1:15:12] horse and a mule together and a horse
[1:15:14] and a donkey together and end up with a
[1:15:16] mule and it can't go any further.
[1:15:18] So, it backfired in the message. It
[1:15:20] wasn't so from the beginning. He said,
[1:15:22] "I'd like for science to answer this
[1:15:24] one. If there's such a thing as
[1:15:26] evolution, he says, "And they claim that
[1:15:28] it could uh that it could come some
[1:15:31] other way. Why doesn't something rise
[1:15:33] higher than a man? We have no species
[1:15:36] higher than a man?" because he's in the
[1:15:39] image of God. Nothing can go beyond its
[1:15:42] creator. He said, I'd like them for to
[1:15:44] answer that one for me and they can't do
[1:15:47] it. Why? He said it's the highest
[1:15:48] species in seal of God. He said, I
[1:15:51] believe in evolution. The first thing
[1:15:53] maybe there was just nothing but just
[1:15:55] plain chaos, volcanic eruption. You
[1:15:58] know, God's a great contractor. And uh
[1:16:01] and he was moving the earth around,
[1:16:03] creating calcium, pot ash, petroleum,
[1:16:05] etc. And then uh he said what came up
[1:16:08] next? He says probably flowers and then
[1:16:11] vegetation vegetations and the birds
[1:16:14] flew out of the dust of the earth. And
[1:16:16] then came the animal life and it kept
[1:16:18] getting higher life, higher life, higher
[1:16:20] life, higher life until finally a man
[1:16:23] came up in the very image of God.
[1:16:27] Now
[1:16:29] having said that I want you to
[1:16:32] think about the higher life more
[1:16:35] revelation more revelation
[1:16:38] in the world more achievement more
[1:16:41] achievement
[1:16:43] until today there's a tremendous
[1:16:45] fascination
[1:16:47] and a a tremendous amount of research
[1:16:51] that's taking place in the space and
[1:16:54] space labs
[1:16:56] China is coming up with one. Europe has
[1:17:00] one. United States has one. They're not
[1:17:03] up there playing Scrabble.
[1:17:06] They're doing research.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; And they're trying to determine how they
[1:17:10] can make things better on Earth
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; and even to get dwellings up in space
[1:17:15] and how many might dwell and to get
[1:17:17] cities, etc. If time were to go on, they
[1:17:19] probably would have all kinds of people
[1:17:21] living in space and some very very, you
[1:17:25] know, uh uh something special up there.
[1:17:29] I I don't want to be there. I I I'm
[1:17:31] already going to go to space.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Are you
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; plan to be there?
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Okay, we'll have a great time. Amen.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; But why are they so why are they at this
[1:17:44] time so gripped and so consumed by that?
[1:17:48] Because spiritually it has come to that
[1:17:51] time
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; building one upon the other. And God
[1:17:58] is going to
[1:18:01] have another achievement.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, it's going to be a
[1:18:05] masterpiece of achievement.
[1:18:10] Abel, we've just read, Abel was the
[1:18:12] first one to offer a sacrifice
[1:18:15] acceptable. Just listen to me closely.
[1:18:18] Abel, a man like you and I
[1:18:22] was able to offer an acceptable
[1:18:26] sacrifice to the creator of heavens and
[1:18:29] earth, all things.
[1:18:32] I want to say that was an achievement.
[1:18:37] man like you and I to the creator of
[1:18:41] heavens and earth that that brought all
[1:18:44] the universe into being and all the
[1:18:46] galaxies into being that we could even
[1:18:49] approach God.
[1:18:51] That was an achievement.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; They could bring something that God
[1:18:55] Almighty would look upon and and and
[1:18:57] accept that sacrifice.
[1:19:00] I think that's a major achievement.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:04] Enoch was the first astronaut, became
[1:19:07] weightless,
[1:19:08] defied gravity. You can say amen if you
[1:19:11] think it's an achievement.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; That was very early to do that. And was
[1:19:16] translated and defeated death.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; That was an achievement.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; I think he should go down in the annals
[1:19:22] of of history. However, they they they
[1:19:24] think that that's not a reality. I think
[1:19:27] that Noah being warned of God, of things
[1:19:29] that was yet to come, prepared an arc to
[1:19:32] the saving of his family, the saving of
[1:19:34] his household. I think that's an
[1:19:36] achievement
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; when a man with another seven souls
[1:19:40] would be saved
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; off of destruction.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; What would you do if we said there were
[1:19:47] seven to be saved out of this entire
[1:19:49] Pacific Northwest and there was only
[1:19:51] seven, you're one of them? Would that be
[1:19:52] an achievement? Amen.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Did that happen? Is that a myth? It
[1:19:57] happened.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't just a few people in the
[1:20:00] Pacific Northwest. It was the entire
[1:20:02] earth. Why? Because he believed God's
[1:20:06] word
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; regardless of how absurd it sounded. He
[1:20:11] believed it. Abraham and Sarah reversed
[1:20:14] the aging process
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; and produced a son
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; when he was 100 and she was 90. Was that
[1:20:21] an achievement? I'm talking about the
[1:20:23] achievements of faith.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; I think even today if we could if we
[1:20:27] could say thank God I know I know that I
[1:20:32] know that I know I am able to offer an
[1:20:34] acceptable sacrifice to God because I
[1:20:37] believe him. I believe his word. That's
[1:20:40] an achievement.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; So when I go to church, millions go to
[1:20:44] church. I put something in the offering.
[1:20:46] Millions put things in the offering. I
[1:20:48] prayed, millions pray.
[1:20:51] Yes sir.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Millions sacrifice. People give their
[1:20:56] lives do so even more than perhaps pray
[1:20:59] more than you pray
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; or I pray.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; It's not based on that. It's based on
[1:21:06] believing
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; the word that God sends.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; And it's not necessarily just our
[1:21:15] doctrine or what we believe. It's what
[1:21:18] God confirms that is his voice
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; that God confirms. That's why I go back
[1:21:24] to the uh to the vindication so very
[1:21:27] very much. Outside of the vindication,
[1:21:29] you only got another doctrine.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen. Outside of
[1:21:33] the vindication, you're only another
[1:21:35] church.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Outside of that supernatural
[1:21:39] vindication, people think, "Oh, well,
[1:21:41] that was the first pull, second pull."
[1:21:43] When a prophet of God is standing there
[1:21:44] saying your name is such and such and
[1:21:46] you live at such and such a place that
[1:21:48] happens to be the only thing that
[1:21:50] separates it from any other message.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that separates it
[1:21:56] from all other millions of religious
[1:21:58] books.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; That one thing
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; that's why I'm very careful with the
[1:22:08] message to stay with what it says.
[1:22:12] You can get all kinds of types and all
[1:22:14] kinds of glamorous things even out of
[1:22:16] the scripture. But when the prophet of
[1:22:18] God comes to it, he he maybe doesn't say
[1:22:20] a thing about it. If he doesn't say a
[1:22:22] thing about it, I'd stay away from it.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; I've seen I've seen things in this
[1:22:30] groups and this message goes as sideways
[1:22:32] and is haywire. And if you go down to
[1:22:34] the very bottom of they start saying
[1:22:35] something he didn't say. Did they get
[1:22:38] excited? Oh, were they excited?
[1:22:41] Were they inspired? Absolutely they were
[1:22:43] inspired. Brother Brandham says David
[1:22:45] was inspired when he was singing, even
[1:22:47] bringing the word back to the people the
[1:22:49] wrong way.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen. That's
[1:22:55] exactly the truth.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; It's not only the word. It's the word
[1:23:00] coming back the right way
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; through the right vessel.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:09] That is why when the word was coming
[1:23:12] back, it couldn't be on a new cart. Had
[1:23:15] to be on the shoulders of the of the
[1:23:18] priesthood, the priests. That's the only
[1:23:20] way it comes back.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; And sisters,
[1:23:26] be very careful. There was no women
[1:23:28] amongst the priests.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; They're not authorized to handle the
[1:23:33] word of God.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; So, keep it where you where you belong.
[1:23:39] I told you I was going to preach.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching quietly,
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; but I'm preaching.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; And things that you need to hear, things
[1:23:49] that we need to keep in line because
[1:23:51] it's contrary to the spirit of this age.
[1:23:59] The word comes on the shoulders of the
[1:24:01] priests.
[1:24:04] And then Moses conquered the superpower
[1:24:09] of military power of the world. The
[1:24:12] superpower with the word of God and a
[1:24:15] rod in his hand. That's an achievement.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; And Rahab the harlot ascended so high
[1:24:25] until she passed into the New Testament
[1:24:29] as one of the mothers of Jesus Christ.
[1:24:32] to go from harlot
[1:24:35] to the mother, one of the four running
[1:24:38] mothers of Jesus Christ. That to me is
[1:24:41] an achievement.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; You don't know what that means to me
[1:24:47] right here in this congregation saying
[1:24:49] that right now. I've done counseling
[1:24:51] with people. I've had people write me.
[1:24:53] I've had people send me and say, "You
[1:24:56] said just a certain thing." and it
[1:24:59] lifted them up from the drags and the
[1:25:02] depths of despair and sin. The power of
[1:25:06] the word of God,
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; it has that same power. We're building
[1:25:10] on the same power that was in the book
[1:25:12] of Acts. It's the same power.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; There people sitting in this
[1:25:18] congregation at just even prior to camp.
[1:25:21] I saw the heaviness. I saw the cloud. I
[1:25:24] saw the rebellion. I saw all of those
[1:25:26] things. I saw the word night after
[1:25:29] night. Break that.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And lives changed. Not an
[1:25:35] emotional thing, but a a a substance by
[1:25:39] faith. We saw the substance.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is a lifechanging word.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Believe me, friends, if I never would
[1:25:48] preach another service, don't miss one
[1:25:50] thing for sure. You are going to pass as
[1:25:53] an individual. You're going to pass from
[1:25:55] this world. You're going to pass from
[1:25:57] this brief brief time. The Bible says
[1:26:00] your life is a vapor.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Look at yourself and tell yourself, "I'm
[1:26:04] a vapor. I'm just here for a short
[1:26:07] time."
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm going to give you a
[1:26:09] word today to hold before you a promise
[1:26:12] to hold before you because God's given
[1:26:14] us a promise that's not back in the
[1:26:16] horse and buggy age. It's not back in
[1:26:19] some distant age. It's right here now.
[1:26:22] Amen.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; God has given us a word now.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; and hearing by the word of God.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Not just reading the Bible, the word for
[1:26:33] this hour.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; God's not going to tell you how to make
[1:26:38] a yoke for an oxen. It's not for that
[1:26:41] age. He's going to tell you about space.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; He's going to tell you how to be
[1:26:45] changed.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; He's going to make statements to you.
[1:26:48] You'll be changed in your atoms. So you
[1:26:52] can say ah the word for this hour
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; I understand that
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; being changed in my atoms that's where I
[1:27:00] focus now all my attention that's where
[1:27:03] I focus my faith that's my language
[1:27:07] that's for this generation
[1:27:10] God didn't preach you an antique message
[1:27:12] through the prophet he didn't give you
[1:27:14] an antique message not 500y old services
[1:27:18] not an antique message it's tomorrow's
[1:27:20] message.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; It's today's message.
[1:27:25] It's a word that you believe that word
[1:27:28] that word will change your body.
[1:27:32] That word will change your very
[1:27:34] structure.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; It was in this age they discovered DNA.
[1:27:39] What is it? It's a structure. The DNA,
[1:27:42] the structure of your body, the
[1:27:44] structure of your cells.
[1:27:47] And they say you can go on and and and
[1:27:50] join into some uh some websites that
[1:27:53] will for a fee trace your DNA because
[1:27:56] they said find out who your ancestor is.
[1:27:59] I looked at that. I said, "Thank God I
[1:28:01] know who my ancestor is."
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; I had someone had had had a key to the
[1:28:08] structure of the DNA. a prophet of God
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; that could tell me where I come from,
[1:28:14] tell me how the structure was, tell me
[1:28:16] who my ancestry. They said, "Do you want
[1:28:18] to go deep, deep into your ancestry?"
[1:28:21] I've gone deep into my ancestry.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God gave you your
[1:28:28] spiritual DNA.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; And the scripture has the structure of
[1:28:33] your DNA. It just took the spiritual
[1:28:36] science to bring it out. Yeah.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; And show you how it was structured.
[1:28:43] Because the word of God, you can't read
[1:28:44] it like a paperback book. You just can't
[1:28:46] read it like a book. Man put it into a
[1:28:48] book. But you have to have to be able to
[1:28:51] understand the spiritual structure.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; It takes a scientist. Why didn't they
[1:28:58] discover your DNA hundreds of years ago?
[1:29:01] It wasn't the time.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; It's the time now.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:11] Thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; They've proven now we've had several
[1:29:19] within the
[1:29:21] in the penal system.
[1:29:24] We've had men I feel very sorry for them
[1:29:28] that have been in prison for 15 years
[1:29:31] and more for the murder
[1:29:35] of perhaps a young woman. One in Ontario
[1:29:39] has been spent most of his life in
[1:29:41] prison for murdering a young girl, but
[1:29:46] his DNA
[1:29:48] proved he didn't do it.
[1:29:52] Hallelujah.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; The devil, he tried to lay a lot of
[1:29:57] things on us.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; He tried to lay He like, he like to heat
[1:30:01] condemnation. But God God rich in mercy.
[1:30:08] God rich in mercy.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Have you ever had a condemnation? Has he
[1:30:13] ever come your way, tried to condemn you
[1:30:15] and put a cloud on your life? But God
[1:30:18] came and read your DNA.
[1:30:22] Not your DNA that came from your mother
[1:30:24] and dad. By that you were a sinner, but
[1:30:28] the DNA that came back into God's body.
[1:30:32] Hallelujah.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; The very righteousness, the scripture
[1:30:34] says, the very righteousness of Jesus
[1:30:36] Christ, we are the righteousness of
[1:30:38] Christ.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; And by that DNA, there was no sin cannot
[1:30:43] find any sin. Even Pilate had to say, "I
[1:30:46] find no fault in him." His DNA, there
[1:30:49] was no sin in the DNA of Jesus Christ.
[1:30:52] Hallelujah.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; And our righteousness is in him. But we
[1:30:56] had to have a messenger that could come
[1:30:58] and read the structure of your spiritual
[1:31:01] DNA. You knew nothing about that. And
[1:31:03] there isn't a denomination in the world
[1:31:05] that can tell you anything about that.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus
[1:31:14] Christ. It's the power of God under
[1:31:16] salvation.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; The DNA,
[1:31:19] your spiritual DNA. Without that, you
[1:31:22] can just go ahead and accept all your
[1:31:24] condemnation. But for my part, I want
[1:31:27] nothing to do with it.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Don't allow Satan to point to your human
[1:31:33] side
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; because that will surely bring you into
[1:31:39] a deep pit of despair and condemnation.
[1:31:41] Who has not failed? We've all failed.
[1:31:44] Okay. What makes you different then?
[1:31:46] We've believed a word.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; That God sent.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Listen. If this is just William Brandham
[1:31:55] speaking, we're all gone. We're all
[1:31:57] gone.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; We're all gone.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; We're no further off than people who
[1:32:02] believe that Jesus was just a man that
[1:32:04] died.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; No further off than the Muslims or
[1:32:07] anyone else.
[1:32:09] That's right. Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Your confidence is, I believe, a word
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; that God sent to this hour.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; It's an astronaut word. It's a space
[1:32:18] word.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; It's a centuries word. It's a season for
[1:32:22] It's a word for this season, for this
[1:32:24] time. It's a rapture word.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; It's a change of the body message.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; And that's where our faith is.
[1:32:34] Hallelujah.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; And Paul says in the Hebrews, "What
[1:32:41] shall I say more?
[1:32:43] Time will fail me to speak of Gideon and
[1:32:46] Bareric and Samson and Jeff."
[1:32:49] And David also and Samuel and the
[1:32:51] prophets, they're all achievers.
[1:32:55] They all made great achievements. They
[1:32:57] quenched they quench the fire that they
[1:33:00] quenched the violence of fire.
[1:33:03] They escaped the edge of the sword. Out
[1:33:06] of weakness was made strong and they
[1:33:09] waxed valiant in fight.
[1:33:12] Women received their dead raised to life
[1:33:14] again.
[1:33:16] That's an achievement.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; I heard of a man in Central America.
[1:33:24] I don't know him personally.
[1:33:26] I don't remember whether I met him or
[1:33:28] not. Here's a minister
[1:33:32] and this message
[1:33:35] very very poor very poor
[1:33:39] but I know a minister that knows him
[1:33:40] real well and he was away in the
[1:33:43] mountains of Central America Guatemala
[1:33:45] or one of the places Nicaragua someplace
[1:33:47] down there
[1:33:49] and this particular minister who I was
[1:33:51] acquainted with was very close to them
[1:33:54] and this man is up in the mountains
[1:33:57] and he's preaching
[1:33:59] And word comes to him that his mother
[1:34:02] has pip died.
[1:34:05] And it just threw him into desperation.
[1:34:11] But he told he got down. He told the
[1:34:12] Lord, "I have no money.
[1:34:15] I don't even have the money to bury
[1:34:17] her."
[1:34:19] And so he told him, "Just wait till he
[1:34:21] gets home." So she was dead for I don't
[1:34:24] know, one day, two days, three days. And
[1:34:28] he came back and I don't know all the
[1:34:30] details,
[1:34:32] but I heard from the mouth of this
[1:34:33] pastor that knows him real well. He went
[1:34:36] in and he prayed and he told the Lord
[1:34:39] all about it
[1:34:41] and his situation, his condition. And
[1:34:43] God raised that mother up to life again.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Has it ever come into my heart? Yep.
[1:34:56] Yeah, it has.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; There was one of our people that passed
[1:35:02] away and I was in my car when I got the
[1:35:04] message
[1:35:07] and I thought that this is not to
[1:35:10] happen.
[1:35:13] This shall not happen.
[1:35:16] And I said to I said to the Lord, I will
[1:35:19] go right now. I'm going to the hospital
[1:35:22] and raise her from the dead.
[1:35:26] of course you're sitting quiet.
[1:35:29] But I just was absolutely adamant that
[1:35:32] was just not to happen. And for my own
[1:35:34] sake, I was totally convinced. And I was
[1:35:37] at that moment on my way to the Langley
[1:35:39] Hospital.
[1:35:41] And I was absolutely certain she would
[1:35:44] just rise from the dead.
[1:35:46] I had a tape on the car. I don't even
[1:35:48] know what tape it was. And I just pushed
[1:35:52] it in. And brother Brandham said,"Well,
[1:35:54] now he said,
[1:35:57] "We wouldn't dare do that
[1:36:00] unless God told you to."
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; And I was smitten.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Because I knew this wasn't an accident.
[1:36:08] And so then I told the Lord, "If you say
[1:36:10] so, I will go."
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; And there was no voice, no nothing
[1:36:15] inside. I've heard that voice inside.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; I would just love that.
[1:36:21] I love that challenge. I'd love to go
[1:36:25] and raise somebody from the dead.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What an achievement.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; I haven't invented anything in my life.
[1:36:35] I'd love to go.
[1:36:38] Is there anything that I'd love to do
[1:36:39] more? Yes.
[1:36:42] I would like to be alive
[1:36:44] and feel or sense somehow that sweep. I
[1:36:48] don't need to feel anything. I don't
[1:36:49] need to tickle. I don't need a chill. I
[1:36:51] don't need nothing. I don't need
[1:36:52] anything going up and down my spine. I
[1:36:55] just want to know the presence. Uh I
[1:36:57] believe it'll just be the presence of
[1:36:58] God will be such an intensity. It'll
[1:37:00] just be a sweep.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; It will be in another realm.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; And we're going to start seeing. We're
[1:37:05] going to start to see a lot of people.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Won't necessarily be you there. Just the
[1:37:09] way you're dressed. It won't be me the
[1:37:10] way I am this morning. We just start
[1:37:12] seeing a lot of people
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; and they're going to start saying,
[1:37:16] "Welcome.
[1:37:18] Welcome.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, that is a an
[1:37:23] achievement that God has set aside for
[1:37:26] this age.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Let me ask
[1:37:37] you something.
[1:37:40] When Jesus said to the disciples,
[1:37:42] "Don't go preaching. Go and tar in
[1:37:44] Jerusalem and wait for the Holy Spirit
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; and you'll be filled with the Holy
[1:37:51] Ghost. Try until you're filled with the
[1:37:54] Holy Ghost.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you something sincerely.
[1:37:59] Do you think they were sitting there
[1:38:02] thinking,
[1:38:05] "Boy, I wonder how my farm's doing. Oh
[1:38:07] my goodness. I wonder how I wonder how
[1:38:09] my wonder hope my hope my people
[1:38:11] employees aren't running the business
[1:38:13] into the ground. Oh my goodness, the
[1:38:15] bills I got to pay. Oh, you think they
[1:38:17] were thinking about that? No, they were
[1:38:18] just thinking they only had one thing in
[1:38:20] their mind. He said, Terry, wait. Wait
[1:38:23] until the Holy Spirit comes. Wait, what
[1:38:25] are you doing? I'm just waiting till the
[1:38:26] Holy Spirit comes. What? Their whole
[1:38:28] faith was focused on the word that had
[1:38:31] been given for that moment.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; What should we be thinking about? We
[1:38:36] should wake up in the morning thinking
[1:38:38] about the change. This body's going to
[1:38:40] be changed. I'm here for the rapture.
[1:38:42] I'm a rapture person. I'm one that God
[1:38:44] has sent to this age to experience this
[1:38:48] experience.
[1:38:49] [Applause]
[1:38:51] [Music]
[1:38:57] died believing in case it wasn't them.
[1:39:00] They died in the faith. And the Bible
[1:39:02] says that those that raised, those that
[1:39:04] died in Christ, they will raise
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; with the same faith that was in their
[1:39:09] heart. Is this making sense to you,
[1:39:11] friends?
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; We have a a 21st century message.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; You can go back. You can go back home
[1:39:20] and become all entangled and engulfed.
[1:39:23] But I would say to you this morning,
[1:39:25] refrain from being swallowed up
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; by this life.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; If we're swallowed up with this life,
[1:39:32] we'll stay with this life. I don't want
[1:39:35] to be hung here to this life. I don't
[1:39:38] want to be attached to this life. We
[1:39:40] want to be in the world, but not of the
[1:39:42] world.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:52] God's achievement in the evolution of
[1:39:54] his redemptive work.
[1:39:57] The prophet of God said the evolution of
[1:39:59] the spirit being given more and more.
[1:40:02] And I'll give you the quote. He said
[1:40:04] because the body is building coming to
[1:40:07] the head which is Christ in invisible
[1:40:10] union. He said in each generation,
[1:40:14] in each generation, this is another one.
[1:40:16] You young people who are just at camp.
[1:40:18] This is your generation. In each
[1:40:21] generation, God has allotted his word.
[1:40:24] It's all here.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; It's all here.
[1:40:29] And you don't you don't really need me
[1:40:32] to try to enthuse you to a certain
[1:40:36] level. That's not the point. The point
[1:40:39] is that I take we take we accept and
[1:40:42] acknowledge and I know that this
[1:40:43] assembly will agree with me. We
[1:40:46] acknowledge that God has sent his word
[1:40:48] for this day to this generation.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Within this generation, all various age
[1:40:54] groups, all various backgrounds, but
[1:40:57] there are those amongst us, and I put
[1:41:00] myself in that number by God's grace, I
[1:41:04] trust that I may experience this thing.
[1:41:07] You know, I just said to the Lord,
[1:41:09] "Well, if if you're making this a
[1:41:11] reality to me, I'm just renewed in my
[1:41:14] faith that I will experience the change
[1:41:17] of the body and the going home by the
[1:41:19] rapture."
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; And if it doesn't happen, let me enthuse
[1:41:24] someone else. Let me inspire someone
[1:41:26] else to believe it. Amen.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; But you that are here and you have your
[1:41:29] youth and you have your strength, let me
[1:41:32] say to you,
[1:41:34] I would either I would sooner believe it
[1:41:38] and die believing it than just settle
[1:41:41] back and not believe it.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; I don't think that should be the
[1:41:46] foremost thought in our minds.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; An invisible union. He said, let's say
[1:41:54] he created botney life. Here's the
[1:41:56] evolution. Then he created animal life.
[1:41:58] Next he created human life and kind of
[1:42:00] an evolution rising higher. So so has it
[1:42:04] been in God in his church. And then he
[1:42:07] goes through a justification,
[1:42:09] sanctification. He said that's pulling
[1:42:11] his bride out. Now he's creating. Why do
[1:42:14] you think that the prophet is speaking
[1:42:16] this at the very ending of his ministry?
[1:42:18] Because he's trying to tell them and
[1:42:21] this is invisible union. trying to tell
[1:42:24] them unequivocally that it's been going
[1:42:26] higher and higher and then he calls it
[1:42:29] the evolution of the spirit being given
[1:42:32] more and more. You can read all you
[1:42:35] want. Go into all the scientific
[1:42:37] achievements. Go into all the all the
[1:42:39] writings and readings and whatever more
[1:42:41] on evolution. You'll never hear that
[1:42:43] kind of phrase, the evolution of the
[1:42:46] spirit.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; I want to be part of that motion. Amen.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; I want to be part of what's happening
[1:42:54] there.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; The evolution of the spirit.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Pulling it higher and higher.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; I want to go on record this morning in
[1:43:02] front of you people. I'm calling on God.
[1:43:05] Take me higher and higher in the
[1:43:07] evolution of the spirit of God.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; If no one else wants to go, let them
[1:43:13] stay. If they want to stay with their
[1:43:15] little things and little pep things, let
[1:43:17] them stay. They want to stay attached to
[1:43:19] the world, let them stay. But by God's
[1:43:21] grace,
[1:43:22] [Applause]
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; I want to go higher and higher.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; I want to enthuse you to go higher and
[1:43:29] higher.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Become a part of this evolution. I'm not
[1:43:33] preaching a sermon. I'm talking to you.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you what God has spoken to
[1:43:38] my heart.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; I'm in danger of becoming a fanatic here
[1:43:46] this morning.
[1:43:49] Amen.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; I mean business.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Lest we lest we have spent our time in
[1:43:56] vain.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; What are we doing here?
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Just coming to church, spending all
[1:44:00] these years. I've labored among him for
[1:44:02] over 35 years. Tried to be an example.
[1:44:05] What would be the purpose of all this
[1:44:07] energy and loss of life?
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; I and my family want to take a a
[1:44:12] vacation in in September. I think it's
[1:44:15] the second time that we've been able to
[1:44:17] take some days together as a family.
[1:44:20] We've given that up.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Many of you maybe go with your families.
[1:44:25] We haven't been able to go as a family
[1:44:27] because of the gospel, the burden of the
[1:44:29] gospel. And I don't think that's a big
[1:44:31] sacrifice. I really don't. Our focus, my
[1:44:34] focus has to be the gospel of Jesus
[1:44:37] Christ.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Either this is a reality.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Or it's a just a vain emptiness.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; We're not interested in religion.
[1:44:50] Everybody's got religion. You
[1:44:52] understand? We're not interested in just
[1:44:54] going to church and having camp
[1:44:56] meetings. We're interested in the word
[1:44:58] for this hour.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; And then the preaching of that word will
[1:45:03] create faith
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; to receive what that promise is.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Did I make that clear?
[1:45:10] It's not just simply believing in
[1:45:11] something of of a past day, but it's
[1:45:14] believing what God sent you.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; That's why I so appreciate what that
[1:45:19] brother, the Chinese brother, who was
[1:45:21] released out of prison and then being
[1:45:23] interrogated uh by the authorities and
[1:45:26] they said, "Why do you believe this man,
[1:45:29] William Brham?" He said, "I don't. It's
[1:45:33] not William Brham. It's what God sent
[1:45:36] through him to me."
[1:45:38] Hallelujah.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; It's not just somebody from
[1:45:41] Jeffersonville, Indiana. Not just
[1:45:43] somebody from any place, but it's what
[1:45:45] God sent through him to you.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; It's not just how to be better people,
[1:45:54] just how to get along in this world, but
[1:45:56] it's how to get you from this place to
[1:45:57] that place.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; After he saw it. After he saw it. and
[1:46:05] and I'm standing in front of his one
[1:46:08] just after the curtain after be going
[1:46:10] beyond the curtain of time I sat on a
[1:46:12] hillside with him
[1:46:15] and he just looked at that great expanse
[1:46:17] of marvelous creation of God's beauty
[1:46:22] just so marvelous
[1:46:25] and looking this way I didn't know even
[1:46:27] what he was doing looked up and down
[1:46:30] said brother Eddie on the other side
[1:46:34] it's very much like this
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; gave me such a desire
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; to go there.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; And when you get there, he said, you'll
[1:46:45] find little paths, little trails.
[1:46:48] You walk down one of those one day,
[1:46:50] you'll find me.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; I'm planning on it.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; I'm planning on it. As much as I plan to
[1:46:58] go out that door this afternoon, I'm
[1:47:01] planning on it.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; That trail is there.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Long before this church was here, that
[1:47:07] trail was there.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; It's a reality, friends.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; It's not just some foggy uh mystical
[1:47:16] thing out there. It's a reality.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Don't let anything stop you.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; I say in the name of the Lord, don't let
[1:47:22] anything stop you. Don't let job stop
[1:47:24] you. Don't let economics stop you. Don't
[1:47:26] let anything stop you.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Is it all right?
[1:47:34] I tell you something, friends.
[1:47:37] They get down to these fairs and they
[1:47:39] get down at these
[1:47:41] ball games and
[1:47:43] the gym the world Olympics are on.
[1:47:48] My goodness,
[1:47:50] supposed to be some great achievements.
[1:47:57] This is the achievement.
[1:48:01] This is faith's achievement.
[1:48:21] In each age he said God sent out his
[1:48:23] word.
[1:48:31] So the scripture says then faith cometh
[1:48:33] by hearing
[1:48:35] and hearing by the word of God.
[1:48:40] Not merely just reading the word of God
[1:48:43] that I want to emphasize, but the word
[1:48:45] of God that he sent to you.
[1:48:50] In fact, is
[1:48:52] because we're so individual,
[1:48:54] so much individuals,
[1:48:56] God may speak something to you
[1:49:00] and it wouldn't mean anything to anyone
[1:49:02] else. That's true.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because it is to you.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; It is to your situation. It involves
[1:49:10] your circumstances and God will speak to
[1:49:12] you and give you an opportunity to
[1:49:15] believe that
[1:49:18] and you can say I accept that.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; I accept that.
[1:49:25] I would like to
[1:49:27] I would like to have a greater measure
[1:49:28] of faith. I really would.
[1:49:32] I have a great desire.
[1:49:35] And I was speaking to the Lord this
[1:49:38] morning and that's why that
[1:49:41] prayer and that quote of brother
[1:49:42] Brandham's meant so much to me. He said
[1:49:44] we hunger for apostolic times
[1:49:49] again
[1:49:54] in this age of the resurrection and the
[1:49:57] rapture.
[1:49:59] These are just my notes to myself. It
[1:50:01] was absolutely necessary
[1:50:04] that God would send a word that is
[1:50:08] focused around those events.
[1:50:12] And we may
[1:50:14] I may I may say something now that you
[1:50:16] may not understand.
[1:50:21] The focus of the message,
[1:50:25] the objective of the message is not to
[1:50:29] gather just a bride.
[1:50:34] That's not the objective. The objective
[1:50:36] of the message is to take that bride to
[1:50:40] her bridegroom.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; That's the objective.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; And we don't want to fall short of that.
[1:50:47] Amen.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; It's to take you from here
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; to there.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; And that is so
[1:50:55] that is so out of this world. It is so
[1:50:58] beyond the earthly. Well, we're in
[1:51:01] contact with that every day.
[1:51:04] I'm in my study there and I had the
[1:51:06] brothers from the sound up there come
[1:51:08] and they said,
[1:51:10] "Shut your cell phone off."
[1:51:13] Why?
[1:51:14] Well, because I got it on I You can
[1:51:17] never hear it anyway. I just got it on
[1:51:18] vibrate. No, but they says that
[1:51:20] interferes with our our system, our
[1:51:23] sound system up there. It does.
[1:51:26] Now, if I sat there at my desk, I could
[1:51:28] have really been distracted. Now, I want
[1:51:30] to figure that one out. How is something
[1:51:33] coming on my hip that's affecting things
[1:51:35] out there coming through these speakers
[1:51:37] up here and going out over on the
[1:51:39] internet? I I'm not going to do it till
[1:51:40] I figure that one out.
[1:51:44] How are you going to understand that?
[1:51:45] There's waves and sounds going through
[1:51:47] you right now. There's voices going
[1:51:49] through you right now.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; How are you going to understand that?
[1:51:54] This whole uh you know electric magnetic
[1:51:58] field. How are we going to understand
[1:51:59] that? We don't understand it. So it's
[1:52:01] already way beyond us. Just this life
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; just something that they achieved in
[1:52:05] some laboratory. It's way beyond us.
[1:52:08] And that's man
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; with a little brain,
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; a little insignificant brain
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; that has that has achieved that.
[1:52:18] What do you think God's
[1:52:21] achieving?
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; I'd like your mind I'd like you just to
[1:52:26] release your mind. Release your faith.
[1:52:30] What is God wanting to achieve? Don't go
[1:52:33] back. Please don't go back tomorrow
[1:52:36] morning to the normal humrum of your
[1:52:39] everyday life.
[1:52:41] While you still have to perhaps engage
[1:52:43] in many of the same thing, the same
[1:52:45] duties, but let your mind be completely
[1:52:50] focused on the supernatural.
[1:52:53] Join me, would you?
[1:52:56] [Music]
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; I've been thinking so much about this
[1:53:03] And especially you young people,
[1:53:06] this is your word. This is your message.
[1:53:09] While you got your life in front of you,
[1:53:11] while you got things to do, while you
[1:53:13] got uh you know goals to reach and
[1:53:15] achievements to make, let me tell you
[1:53:18] something. This is the achievement.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; This is the achievement.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; If you miss that, you'll you haven't
[1:53:26] achieved anything.
[1:53:30] Oh,
[1:53:32] but I retired early. Oh, I made a
[1:53:35] fistful of money. Oh,
[1:53:37] I got some I won I won some great, you
[1:53:42] know,
[1:53:44] things in life. No, you failed.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; You failed.
[1:53:50] Regardless of what you came to in life,
[1:53:53] you're a failure.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; If we don't make that
[1:53:58] [Applause]
[1:54:01] Hallelujah.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; I want to give you
[1:54:12] two or three things. I'm preaching this
[1:54:14] way on purpose. Incidentally,
[1:54:26] I'd like to lay before the congregation
[1:54:30] an achievement
[1:54:37] that I trust. I don't want to preach at
[1:54:39] you. I want to say I trust that we can
[1:54:43] all attain to it. That is the
[1:54:45] achievement
[1:54:47] of not having only received the message
[1:54:49] but believing it in such simplicity
[1:54:53] that we are we achieve rapturing grace.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; And here's what he said.
[1:55:05] I pray father that they'll realize it
[1:55:08] isn't trying to condemn them what they
[1:55:10] had. It's only trying to give them more
[1:55:14] rapturing grace. For the hour will come
[1:55:18] when we will we will have to have
[1:55:21] rapture power.
[1:55:24] Not only to heal the body,
[1:55:27] but to change in a moment, in the
[1:55:29] twinkling of an eye, Christ will be so
[1:55:32] real into their bodies till he can
[1:55:36] change it by his great death and what he
[1:55:40] purchased. Amen.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; In the message
[1:55:46] Leodysian church age, he said he is the
[1:55:49] true witness. And he said that he said
[1:55:52] in that the the true witness is not true
[1:55:55] as opposed to false. But he said that
[1:55:58] but one day we'll be changed in the
[1:56:00] atoms because he said it is the true
[1:56:03] witness is taking that which is partial
[1:56:06] and that which is the realization of
[1:56:10] that. So the true witness and listen. Oh
[1:56:14] I wish I just hope you can see it. That
[1:56:17] was the that was what the Lord spoke to
[1:56:20] the seventh church age messenger. Not to
[1:56:23] any of the others but to the last one.
[1:56:25] Why the last one? Cuz we're the people
[1:56:28] of that message. And he's saying this is
[1:56:30] the true witness. Not true as opposed to
[1:56:33] false. He said, not true as opposed to
[1:56:36] false. This is the true witness. Because
[1:56:38] the true witness is this is the
[1:56:40] realization message. This is the full
[1:56:43] realization.
[1:56:45] Hallelujah. This is what everyone else
[1:56:48] prayed for. This is what they sought to
[1:56:51] enter into. This is the realization
[1:56:54] perfect realization message
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; and it's been given so that you can take
[1:56:59] it and believe it
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; with everything that's in your heart.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Now I don't
[1:57:09] perhaps if I speak very very openly
[1:57:13] I don't want you to go away in in some a
[1:57:15] negative way but you know we we we pray
[1:57:18] for things. How many here have tried to
[1:57:21] have faith?
[1:57:24] I have to put up both my hands. We've
[1:57:26] tried to have faith. We've prayed for
[1:57:28] things and it didn't happen. And then
[1:57:32] another time comes and and it just
[1:57:35] something's dropped into you. Brother
[1:57:37] talks about faith.
[1:57:41] It's already done.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; It's a substance.
[1:57:46] Now, friends, I feel that I fall short
[1:57:48] of this. very short of this because I
[1:57:52] had a man say to me once.
[1:57:55] He was sitting in a congregation,
[1:57:58] not while I was pastoring. It was
[1:58:00] another church. He was sitting in his
[1:58:02] congregation and he was just observing.
[1:58:05] He was observing people being prayed
[1:58:06] for, the sick being prayed for. And he
[1:58:09] wasn't professing anything. And I
[1:58:12] stepped back and I kind of put my hand
[1:58:15] on his shoulder and said, 'You know, do
[1:58:18] you feel that this this Christ and this
[1:58:21] gospel and salvation is for you? And he
[1:58:23] said, well, actually, he said, you know,
[1:58:25] I I I don't know. He said, uh, I see you
[1:58:28] up there praying for people that are
[1:58:30] sick and so on, and they're not getting
[1:58:31] healed, so how would I have any
[1:58:34] confidence you pray for me that I'd be
[1:58:35] saved?
[1:58:37] And
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; that threw me for a loop
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; cuz he was sitting there watching what
[1:58:42] was happening in the church. He says, "I
[1:58:44] I don't see it happening. So, how do I
[1:58:46] know that if you pray for me, I'll have
[1:58:49] I'll have eternal life?" He would just
[1:58:50] ask you an honest question. How do I
[1:58:52] know I'll have eternal life? Well, we
[1:58:56] don't stop there because on the other
[1:58:58] hand, there is the sovereignty, the
[1:59:02] sovereignty of God. God not only does
[1:59:05] what he wishes to do, but he does it
[1:59:07] when he wishes to do it.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; And I have prayed for things and they
[1:59:12] didn't happen. And then other things
[1:59:13] that I I knew were there. They were in
[1:59:16] need and they were on my heart and so
[1:59:17] on. And then God just sends a word and
[1:59:19] says, "It's done."
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; It's actually done.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:59:25] I'm bringing you down. Now I know that
[1:59:29] you would say, "Amen. We have received
[1:59:33] the message with rapturing grace.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; It's where I want to bring you this
[1:59:41] morning because I'm bringing myself to
[1:59:43] that point.
[1:59:45] The way the messenger, the way brother
[1:59:47] Brandham talked about real faith,
[1:59:51] if we have the kind of faith that that
[1:59:53] message is to bring us, we're already
[1:59:56] over there.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not trying to have it.
[2:00:00] We're not trying to see ourselves over
[2:00:03] there. We're not We're not trying to
[2:00:07] generate some faith.
[2:00:09] You're already over there.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Hey, I've had it. I've had those kind of
[2:00:15] experiences where it is already been
[2:00:18] done.
[2:00:19] Just forget it. It's already finished.
[2:00:22] I've had it more than once on things
[2:00:25] that I didn't were not,
[2:00:28] you know, critical to my life, but it
[2:00:32] was done. It was already finished.
[2:00:35] I've had it in the church. I've had God
[2:00:38] speak and said, "It's all finished. Tell
[2:00:41] that person." I didn't even know where
[2:00:42] the I didn't even know where the
[2:00:43] information came from. I thought, "Who
[2:00:46] told me that?"
[2:00:48] say somebody must have told me that
[2:00:50] because I was pregnantated with with the
[2:00:53] knowledge the mind of God. So I was
[2:00:54] trying to think who told me that. I
[2:00:56] couldn't even think who told me that. So
[2:00:58] I thought well I'll go and tell them
[2:00:59] anyway and go and told them
[2:01:02] and they wanted to know where'd you hear
[2:01:03] that. I didn't even know that myself
[2:01:07] till just now.
[2:01:09] See that's God. It's already done.
[2:01:11] Brother Brandham said and and he and he
[2:01:13] takes that infallible the infallibility
[2:01:16] of God and links it to the message to
[2:01:19] the visions. So he said when I see the
[2:01:21] vision I know that it's all finished.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; That's what God did for him. See as a
[2:01:28] messenger. Oh friends I hope I get this
[2:01:31] across here. When he saw the vision it
[2:01:34] was done.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; He said if God gave me a vision he was
[2:01:36] going to that I was to go and raise
[2:01:38] George Washington and go to the grave.
[2:01:41] He says, "I'd call the world to say it."
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; And then he relates the the boy in
[2:01:47] Finland
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; that was raised from the dead. He said
[2:01:50] to the brothers who were around him,
[2:01:52] "Are you listening?" He said to the
[2:01:54] brothers, "If this boy doesn't come to
[2:01:55] life, I'm a false prophet."
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of messenger.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of messenger. And
[2:02:05] because that never failed, because that
[2:02:08] never failed. I put all my confidence,
[2:02:11] all my trust,
[2:02:13] I'm not I'm not putting all my trust in
[2:02:15] a bunch of books. I'm not putting all my
[2:02:17] trust in just that. I'm putting my trust
[2:02:19] in the God that sent that messenger.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; And the fact that that boy raised from
[2:02:24] the dead, the fact that a brother sat in
[2:02:27] my house that has visited him. The fact
[2:02:29] that I spoke to the woman who drove
[2:02:31] whose husband drove the car that killed
[2:02:33] the boy. I can tell you that today
[2:02:35] because that has happened. I have
[2:02:37] absolute confidence if that man then
[2:02:39] takes that and then comes over here and
[2:02:41] says I was transported beyond the
[2:02:43] curtain of time.
[2:02:45] I I I don't want that to be a pie in the
[2:02:47] sky. I don't want that to be a hope.
[2:02:50] Everybody, hey, all kinds of people,
[2:02:52] Pentecost, Baptist, all kinds of people,
[2:02:55] they all plan to go to heaven. They
[2:02:58] believe that word with everything that's
[2:02:59] in them. What makes it different is
[2:03:01] because this one went by visions
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; and the visions never failed.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; He saw the place, saw the people.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; That's where our faith I'm just trying
[2:03:16] to now increase your faith.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; To increase your faith, not your desire.
[2:03:24] We all have the desire but to increase
[2:03:26] your faith that you can and when faith
[2:03:28] drops in you see yourself there.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; You don't imagine yourself there you see
[2:03:35] yourself there.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; And when faith takes hold
[2:03:41] it affect your own life.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; You live different.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; You have a different a different
[2:03:49] uh
[2:03:51] you have a different view of life.
[2:03:54] You really do. You have a different view
[2:03:56] of life.
[2:04:01] Sometimes things go well. Sometimes they
[2:04:04] go difficult.
[2:04:06] But that should never change that
[2:04:09] that perspective that you have, that
[2:04:12] direction that you have.
[2:04:20] He said, u just a couple more here
[2:04:23] before I close.
[2:04:26] Brother Brandham talks about uh
[2:04:28] rapturing faith as being like the
[2:04:30] harvest rain.
[2:04:33] And then
[2:04:35] he said God isn't going to plant a new
[2:04:37] church. He's going to bring his original
[2:04:40] planting back to the original seed. He
[2:04:43] is doing it as stated in verse 23
[2:04:47] by the teaching or the former reign.
[2:04:50] Next will come the harvest rain or the
[2:04:53] rapturing faith.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; The harvest rain
[2:04:59] and that is the message coming is the
[2:05:02] harvest rain.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; And he said that is rapturing faith.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus spoke about the scripture speaks
[2:05:14] about those that were rich in faith. The
[2:05:16] scripture speaks about those and several
[2:05:18] times Jesus talked about those that were
[2:05:21] weak in faith.
[2:05:23] You know, here we sit as as believers,
[2:05:26] but Jesus talked even to his apostles.
[2:05:30] Why couldn't we cast him out? Oh, ye of
[2:05:33] little faith.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Little faith.
[2:05:37] and and and your messenger.
[2:05:41] I want you to be really really take this
[2:05:44] home. Your messenger,
[2:05:47] I don't want us to live in a in a in a
[2:05:49] message bubble.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; I don't want us to live just in a
[2:05:54] message excitement.
[2:05:56] We've just come out of camp. I don't
[2:05:58] want to live in a in a message emotion.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; I want to live in a reality.
[2:06:05] I'd sooner people have be serious and be
[2:06:08] in a reality and be solid, be unmovable.
[2:06:13] That's what I like to see. And we have
[2:06:15] the same the same messenger. He said
[2:06:21] rapturing faith
[2:06:24] takes more than divine healing faith.
[2:06:29] That that that's that smites me because
[2:06:33] I've prayed for lots of healings and it
[2:06:34] hasn't happened and then I I have that
[2:06:37] in my mind. Rapturing faith takes more.
[2:06:41] So I intend to do something about it.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; I intend to make this a focus.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; I intend to have this on my mind.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; I intend to be obsessed by it.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; I intend to be occupied by it. I intend
[2:06:56] to be preoccupied by it.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; And I want to suggest to you that we do
[2:07:02] that together.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; I want to suggest to you that you fill
[2:07:06] your daytime and you fill and when you
[2:07:09] go to bed at night that you have this on
[2:07:11] your mind.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; What do I have in my mind, brother Bisc?
[2:07:15] What is what you have in your mind? The
[2:07:18] message for the change of this body has
[2:07:21] already come. Let me lay hold of that
[2:07:25] promise.
[2:07:41] And with this I'm closing.
[2:07:45] It'd be good for you to take the
[2:07:47] message, I would encourage you to take
[2:07:48] the message of perfect faith
[2:07:53] and I'd like you to pay special
[2:07:55] attention when brother Brandham begins
[2:07:58] to relate refer to Jesus Christ. You
[2:08:01] know of all of all the years of ministry
[2:08:06] which he had profound
[2:08:11] city shaking
[2:08:12] nation shaking ministry I don't have to
[2:08:16] tell you about it go and read about it
[2:08:17] yourself
[2:08:18] Durban Cape Town Johannesburg
[2:08:23] Bombay
[2:08:24] India all over United States all over
[2:08:27] Canada shook
[2:08:30] millions millions of people.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; I don't have to I don't have to pump up
[2:08:35] the ministry. It was what it is.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; It's already been done.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; That whole thing came for one specific
[2:08:42] purpose. To move you and I
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; up out of where we are
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; and to get us out of here.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; That's the whole purpose.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; If that message fails in that, then then
[2:08:55] the message hasn't failed, but we failed
[2:08:56] to grasp why it came.
[2:08:59] That's what it came for. And if we
[2:09:01] believe it and live it and have
[2:09:04] ourselves focused in that direction and
[2:09:06] we just keep moving in that way day
[2:09:08] after day and we bring up our children,
[2:09:10] we speak to our friends about it. And
[2:09:12] that is the thing that if I have to go,
[2:09:15] if I have to go the way of the grave, I
[2:09:16] would like to go by saying he did
[2:09:18] whatever he could. He spoke about it all
[2:09:20] the time. He spoke about this this
[2:09:22] passing from this life to another place
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; and he encouraged everybody else that he
[2:09:27] could. That's that's the testimony that
[2:09:29] I would like to have.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; But he said this of Christ. He said,
[2:09:33] "Now I want to speak about a different
[2:09:35] kind of faith,
[2:09:38] not faith for healing, a different kind
[2:09:40] of faith."
[2:09:43] And he said, "In order for this faith to
[2:09:45] operate,"
[2:09:49] he said, "you must know your position."
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, you must know, you
[2:09:56] must know
[2:09:58] I have been called by almighty God to to
[2:10:02] this particular place in my life. I've
[2:10:05] been called by God.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; See Jesus Jesus. Now, let me let me just
[2:10:14] say it so that it would be uh in utter
[2:10:16] simplicity. Jesus didn't come and think,
[2:10:20] "Oh,
[2:10:22] I I know what's going to happen in the
[2:10:23] future. Oh, I wish I was in I'd like to
[2:10:26] be in the time of the book of Acts. Oh,
[2:10:29] I'd like to see those thousands. I've
[2:10:31] seen thousands leave me.
[2:10:34] I know that just in the future there's
[2:10:36] going to be 3,000 come in. There'll be
[2:10:38] 5,000 come in. Oh, I just want to be at
[2:10:42] that time.
[2:10:44] That wasn't it." Or he wasn't going
[2:10:46] back. Oh, I wish I'd been back in the
[2:10:48] time of Moses
[2:10:51] and see all these two million people
[2:10:53] come out of bondage. No, he knew who he
[2:10:56] was
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; in the day that he was there
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; and he believed in that.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; Excuse me. The prophet said he believed
[2:11:06] in who he was
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; and his position that God had given him.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; You have to believe in all your heart.
[2:11:13] Don't so many so many look in the past.
[2:11:16] Oh, if we only had those times of the
[2:11:18] past. That's not what we're after. We're
[2:11:20] after what God wants right now.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; I want what God wants out of this
[2:11:24] service.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; I want to see what God wants to do out
[2:11:26] of this meeting.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; The effect of it. And he said, "In order
[2:11:30] for that happen, you have to have faith.
[2:11:33] You have to have faith in the faith.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; You have to actually believe in the God
[2:11:38] that brought you to this place."
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Then you believe them. say, "Well, I
[2:11:43] know that God brought me, not this
[2:11:44] physical building here, but I know God
[2:11:47] brought me to this position.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; What is your position? I'm a member of
[2:11:53] the body of Jesus Christ
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; according to what has been spoken. I'm a
[2:11:58] masterpiece because he said I was a
[2:12:00] masterpiece.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; I am justified because he said I'm
[2:12:04] justified." This is all part of your
[2:12:06] position.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Your position.
[2:12:10] And once you recognize your position,
[2:12:12] then you can believe the word that came
[2:12:14] for this time. I have been called
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; to be changed.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; I've been called
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; for a rapture.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; That's my whole calling.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; So, we don't get all engaged and
[2:12:30] involved with, you know, just the little
[2:12:34] tidbits of life. I know they're
[2:12:35] important, but don't let them consume
[2:12:37] you. Whatever you do, don't let them
[2:12:38] consume you. Let the good times come.
[2:12:41] Let the good times go. Let the hard
[2:12:43] times come. Let the hard times go. You
[2:12:45] have to do it. You just have to do it.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Have we had it? Yes, sir.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; We know. I know something about it,
[2:12:54] friends. I know something about it. And
[2:12:56] do not become encumbered
[2:13:00] with just the things of this life. I say
[2:13:02] it in the name of the Lord. Do not
[2:13:04] become just encumbered with the things
[2:13:06] of this life. This thing needs to be
[2:13:07] your focus.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; When you're at work tomorrow, when
[2:13:11] you're in the house tomorrow, wherever
[2:13:14] you are, I would like to see the effect
[2:13:17] of that as we gather service after
[2:13:20] service. The effect of a whole body of
[2:13:24] people that have one single focus in
[2:13:27] mind.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:36] I see God looking upon us and he's
[2:13:38] saying, "That's why I sent this message.
[2:13:41] That's why I sent it.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; I sent it for that one purpose."
[2:13:48] And I got a people that are believing
[2:13:49] it.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Moving on up out of there.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; And so he said this,
[2:14:00] "You must have faith.
[2:14:02] You must believe it.
[2:14:05] If you don't believe it, then it won't
[2:14:07] work. You know, I read that.
[2:14:18] I'm thinking very very deep. And the
[2:14:20] reason why I'm being a little hesitant
[2:14:23] because a lot of it's personal,
[2:14:26] but like I've said to people,
[2:14:29] there's a degree of importance
[2:14:32] of timing.
[2:14:34] You're going to get in your car this
[2:14:35] morning
[2:14:37] and uh or this afternoon
[2:14:40] and you turn on the key and you drive
[2:14:42] out of this parking lot. You're not
[2:14:45] going to go and check the tires and
[2:14:48] check the gas gauge and check every last
[2:14:50] thing and check all your
[2:14:51] instrumentation. You're just going to go
[2:14:53] in there and turn the key on. Way you
[2:14:55] go. May I get down the road and go put
[2:14:58] put
[2:15:01] I'm out of gas. I'm going to have to
[2:15:02] call aa or get somebody to come and get
[2:15:05] me.
[2:15:06] Doesn't make any difference with a car.
[2:15:08] It's not that important. Don't do that
[2:15:09] in an airplane. Yeah,
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; don't do that in an airplane.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; This might surprise you. I have a
[2:15:18] private pilot's license. That's one of
[2:15:20] the first things they tell you to do.
[2:15:22] You check the tires, you check your
[2:15:24] instruments, and you make sure you got
[2:15:26] fuel. Cuz if you run out, there isn't
[2:15:29] any gas station in the sky.
[2:15:33] You're coming down where you didn't plan
[2:15:34] to come down. See, so when when when the
[2:15:37] messenger says this, he had faith in his
[2:15:40] power and he says, "If you don't," he
[2:15:43] said he said, "If you don't if you don't
[2:15:46] believe it, then it won't work." Oh
[2:15:49] well. Oh, I got a pain in my back and I,
[2:15:52] you know, somehow I'm a little weak in
[2:15:54] my faith and it doesn't really work and
[2:15:56] I go on with the pain so I got the pain.
[2:15:58] That's like having gas, running out of
[2:16:00] gas in your car and it doesn't work.
[2:16:03] You don't want that with regards to
[2:16:06] rapture.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; You don't want that when we're going to
[2:16:15] space.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; You get the point?
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; Get my point?
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; We can have these little afflictions and
[2:16:22] these little things that afflict us in
[2:16:24] this life
[2:16:27] and we pray for it and say, "Well, yeah,
[2:16:29] I guess I haven't got faith." Okay.
[2:16:33] But you can't afford to take that
[2:16:35] attitude
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; with regards to the rapture.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; Okay, while we're in church, you know,
[2:16:42] kind of, oh, how we're going through
[2:16:44] another service. No, you want to come in
[2:16:47] this service. You want to come in the
[2:16:49] next service. You want to come every
[2:16:51] time and say, God, give that man
[2:16:54] something
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; having to do with my eternal welfare.
[2:16:59] Give that man something that will
[2:17:01] contribute to my going home.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; Give that man something that'll help me
[2:17:06] to get out of this place.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Inspire him. Cause him to say something
[2:17:12] and cause me to hear it.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Let me be anointed to receive that
[2:17:16] nugget
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; to help me get out of this place. This
[2:17:20] is my focus. This is my life. This is my
[2:17:22] whole purpose.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; It's why I go to church. That's why I
[2:17:27] pray.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; That's why I believe the message. That's
[2:17:30] why we hear these things. That's why
[2:17:31] we've gone through what we've gone
[2:17:33] through is to get out of this place. If
[2:17:35] without that,
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; the Apostle Paul said, you know,
[2:17:41] if we lose that, we've lost everything.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said we gain the whole world
[2:17:46] and lose our soul. We lost everything.
[2:17:49] Apostle Paul spoke about it. So friends,
[2:17:54] that's my message to you this morning.
[2:17:57] That will be the greatest achievement
[2:18:00] of your faith
[2:18:05] and I pray that you will and I will
[2:18:07] achieve that
[2:18:09] great achievement.
[2:18:14] Let's just have a word of prayer.
[2:18:15] Heavenly Father,
[2:18:18] how
[2:18:21] how important how impressed I am. Oh
[2:18:23] God, how moved I am, Father,
[2:18:29] to think that you in your kindness to
[2:18:32] you in your extra measure of grace
[2:18:37] would actually bring a message of
[2:18:39] rapturing grace, rapturing faith, and
[2:18:43] lay it out. Oh God. Oh God. I don't want
[2:18:48] to be part of the group or part of those
[2:18:51] that remain and still will come to
[2:18:53] altars and still will hear messages
[2:18:56] preached. I don't want to be here during
[2:18:59] that time. I want to be beyond in that
[2:19:03] other dimension, another realm. Oh God,
[2:19:06] that you have prepared the place that
[2:19:08] you have prepared and you have called us
[2:19:10] for that express purpose. And that's why
[2:19:13] we are where we are today, Lord, because
[2:19:16] we have received it. We have believed
[2:19:19] it. But now, if you send a messenger,
[2:19:22] Lord, to his own church trying to
[2:19:24] inspire and trying to increase their
[2:19:27] faith. Surely, surely that would be a
[2:19:30] burden of my own heart, Lord, to see
[2:19:32] that faith increases, God, to put it in
[2:19:35] their minds. Take, I pray, by the Holy
[2:19:38] Spirit and lodge it in their hearts. and
[2:19:40] lodge it in their minds. Oh God, I pray,
[2:19:43] Father, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:19:45] deal with every heart. Father, speak
[2:19:48] with us. I pray in Jesus Christ's name
[2:19:51] and for your glory. Thank you, Lord.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; I'd like to just say a word about
[2:20:02] the after effects of the services and
[2:20:05] the camps. I want to speak to those of
[2:20:07] you that God dealt with and God spoke to
[2:20:11] in the camp and in the services. I won't
[2:20:14] say the camp, but in the services.
[2:20:17] Whatever you do,
[2:20:19] go from that point, go from that that uh
[2:20:24] level where God brought you and drive a
[2:20:27] stake there and go on from there.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; There's a good number. I know that you
[2:20:33] were prayed with and I prayed with a
[2:20:35] good number. I I actually visually saw
[2:20:39] God doing things,
[2:20:42] great things in the lives of the people.
[2:20:45] And I felt on my heart today to say,
[2:20:48] don't don't settle back at that point.
[2:20:53] Don't lose any of what God gave you. Be
[2:20:57] a soldier.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; Be a brave warrior. and take your sword
[2:21:02] in your hand and the shield of faith and
[2:21:05] say, "I go from this place forward. I'm
[2:21:09] not going to lose any ground."
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go from here forward. I
[2:21:16] want to sing faith of our fathers living
[2:21:19] still.
[2:21:26] You can stand if you would please.
[2:21:31] We're not looking back,
[2:21:33] but we've built on from there.
[2:21:37] Hallelujah. We've built from that place
[2:21:41] onto where we are now.
[2:21:44] [Music]
[2:21:53] Faith of our father
[2:21:57] living still today in spite of dark and
[2:22:04] fire and sword.
[2:22:07] Oh, how our hearts beat high with joy
[2:22:14] when we hear that glorious
[2:22:19] word.
[2:22:21] Faith of our father's
[2:22:25] glory
[2:22:26] faith.
[2:22:28] We will be true to thee till death.
[2:22:36] Our father's chain in prison
[2:22:41] dark.
[2:22:43] We're still in heart and conscious
[2:22:48] free.
[2:22:49] How sweet would be their children's
[2:22:54] faith
[2:22:56] if they like
[2:22:59] could die for thee.
[2:23:03] Faith of our father.
[2:23:06] Holy
[2:23:08] faith
[2:23:10] we will be true to thee till death.
[2:23:17] Faith of our father.
[2:23:21] We will love
[2:23:24] both and fool in all our strife
[2:23:31] and preach thee.
[2:23:34] as
[2:23:35] knows how
[2:23:37] by timely works
[2:23:40] and meryallel
[2:23:51] [Music]
[2:24:06] And I would like to just we sang uh
[2:24:11] consecrate me now to thy service, Lord.
[2:24:17] Uh draw me nearer. I like because I want
[2:24:19] to sing the first and the second verse.
[2:24:24] And before we sing this,
[2:24:27] you know, if we were sitting together in
[2:24:28] your home, I could tell you the same
[2:24:30] thing. But I'll just tell you as a whole
[2:24:31] congregation, I was very, very affected
[2:24:34] this morning.
[2:24:38] I was affected by his presence.
[2:24:42] [Music]
[2:24:52] And I just couldn't I couldn't move away
[2:24:56] from the fact
[2:24:59] this whole message to me. The whole
[2:25:01] message came
[2:25:04] and all I saw was the promises
[2:25:07] of the catching away. I went to the
[2:25:10] Bible
[2:25:12] and I read.
[2:25:15] I show you a great mystery.
[2:25:20] We shall not all sleep,
[2:25:23] but we shall all be changed.
[2:25:27] I just like I anchored my faith. We
[2:25:30] shall all be changed. We shall all be
[2:25:31] changed. And I felt
[2:25:35] almost a commission go to the people.
[2:25:39] And I also understood they may not
[2:25:42] understand it. They may not un really
[2:25:44] understand
[2:25:45] but tell them tell them we shall all be
[2:25:48] changed
[2:25:50] and that the word that they have
[2:25:52] believed is that transforming word
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; and they must believe that word. You
[2:25:58] must believe that word. You must believe
[2:26:00] that you've been called to that word.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; I've been called to it.
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; And thus he will give me the grace to
[2:26:11] believe it. Amen.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; Believe in your position.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Believe in it with
[2:26:17] everything that's in you. Believe in
[2:26:19] your position. The prophet said that's
[2:26:20] the only way that the word worked for
[2:26:23] Jesus Christ. Think of it. The only way
[2:26:25] it worked. And if that's the only way it
[2:26:27] worked for him, it's the only way it'll
[2:26:29] work for you and I.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; I am thine. I am.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord.
[2:26:37] I have heard
[2:26:40] thy voice
[2:26:42] and
[2:26:44] thy love to me.
[2:26:49] [Music]
[2:26:54] you
[2:26:56] in the arms
[2:26:58] of faith
[2:27:01] as we lift up
[2:27:05] to thee.
[2:27:09] So draw me nearer,
[2:27:13] nearer,
[2:27:15] nearer. Blessed Lord to the cross where
[2:27:26] [Music]
[2:27:28] drawer
[2:27:31] nearer
[2:27:34] nearer blessing
[2:27:39] to thy preious
[2:27:43] leading
[2:27:47] We're only going to sing the second
[2:27:48] verse as the last verse.
[2:27:52] I'm going to ask you to look at the
[2:27:53] words very, very carefully. Consecrate
[2:27:56] me now.
[2:27:58] Not tomorrow, but now to thy service.
[2:28:03] You've been called to be a farmer, be
[2:28:05] the best farmer there is. You're called
[2:28:07] to be a carpenter, whatever that is.
[2:28:09] Called to be a housewife,
[2:28:12] be the best that there is. But be in
[2:28:15] your position. Know your position. Know
[2:28:17] your place.
[2:28:19] Consecrate me now to thy service, Lord,
[2:28:23] by the power of grace divine. Let's look
[2:28:25] to him as we sing it. Consecrate
[2:28:30] me now to thy service
[2:28:37] by the power of grace.
[2:28:45] and let my soul
[2:28:48] look up with
[2:28:51] [Applause]
[2:28:52] [Music]
[2:28:54] and I will be lost in
[2:29:03] drawer
[2:29:05] [Music]
[2:29:12] to the cross. There
[2:29:20] [Music]
[2:29:32] to thy precious
[2:29:36] [Music]
[2:29:41] a gracious loving Lord Jesus.
[2:29:43] [Music]
[2:29:45] You have reserved a place near to you,
[2:29:50] near to the heart of God, near to your
[2:29:53] bleeding side
[2:29:55] where we are invited. We can come and be
[2:30:00] near you. Oh shepherd, shepherd of the
[2:30:03] flock.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; Oh high priest, touched with the feeling
[2:30:09] of our infirmities.
[2:30:12] Oh high priest that knows the need and
[2:30:16] sees the desire.
[2:30:18] Lord, you are a great burdenbearer.
[2:30:22] You see, father
[2:30:24] what is upon our hearts, each individual
[2:30:26] at this moment. And I pray, oh God of
[2:30:31] Israel, oh God of Abraham, God of Isaac,
[2:30:35] and God of Jacob,
[2:30:38] God of the flock,
[2:30:40] God who led the flock,
[2:30:43] who led the flock under Moses, God who
[2:30:45] led the flock. And today, Lord, you've
[2:30:48] sent your angel.
[2:30:51] You have led us so tenderly.
[2:30:53] We can say my guide.
[2:30:56] We can say you are our leader. We have
[2:30:59] leadership.
[2:31:01] Thank you, Father, for your kindness.
[2:31:05] And oh Lord, there are so many other
[2:31:08] generations of people that have lived
[2:31:12] and lived, I pray, faithful to their
[2:31:14] time. You did not call us for ages past.
[2:31:19] You've called us to this moment.
[2:31:22] And what a time, what a day that we're
[2:31:25] in.
[2:31:26] And Lord, regardless of the wall of sin,
[2:31:30] as it would be, regardless of the power
[2:31:33] of temptation,
[2:31:35] I can declare, Lord, that you have given
[2:31:37] us. And we thank you for the power that
[2:31:41] you've given us that is greater than any
[2:31:43] temptation of the world. I pray for
[2:31:46] those, oh Lord, that have dedicated
[2:31:49] their lives, not only this morning, but
[2:31:51] in the services of the last week. Oh
[2:31:54] God. Oh God. I know that you hear me,
[2:31:58] Lord. And I pray with all that is in me
[2:32:00] with all the hearts that are united
[2:32:03] together. Father, see our faith as we as
[2:32:06] we reach forward for these lives, oh
[2:32:08] God. And I pray you'll keep them in the
[2:32:11] way of holiness and righteousness. I
[2:32:13] pray that you'll keep them, oh God. May
[2:32:16] it be a settled and anchored thing that
[2:32:18] you have done. And may they set their
[2:32:20] sights on eternal life. May they set
[2:32:23] their sights, oh God, on this marvelous,
[2:32:26] marvelous promise of this age. Oh God,
[2:32:29] the change and the transformation of
[2:32:32] these lives and these bodies into the
[2:32:35] eternal. For you have said through your
[2:32:37] mighty apostle Paul, immortality must
[2:32:40] the mortal must put on must put on
[2:32:43] immortality and corruption must put on
[2:32:46] incorruption. Oh God, here we are. Here
[2:32:49] we are, oh God, in our lives. Tomorrow
[2:32:51] will be a day older and the next year
[2:32:53] older if time should go on. But you have
[2:32:56] given us a word that all of that process
[2:32:58] be reversed, oh God, and we step into
[2:33:02] that theophony realm. Oh, thank you,
[2:33:05] Father. Thank you, Father, for the
[2:33:07] reality. Bless your people this day, I
[2:33:10] pray. And may their lives be a rich
[2:33:13] testimony and be a pleasure to you in
[2:33:16] your sight in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:33:22] Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you. Going
[2:33:25] to dismiss you in the name of our Lord
[2:33:27] Jesus and pray you'll just go
[2:33:30] be a blessing to someone else. God bless
[2:33:33] you. You're dismissed.
[2:33:37] Amen.
