[0:00] here you say well my mother is someplace
[0:04] my dad is someplace my father I I came
[0:07] here into this human
[0:09] existence
[0:11] uh listen to me God called for
[0:16] you to come and only used your mother
[0:20] and father and the human instrumentality
[0:22] to bring you here but God called you
[0:26] they didn't know anything about what you
[0:28] were going to be what kind of a child
[0:30] you're going to be how you're going to
[0:31] look how you're going to act what your
[0:33] attributes are what what your uh
[0:36] anything what your skills where what
[0:38] your gifts are what your talents where
[0:40] they're not going to know anything about
[0:41] that God called you
[0:44] here because God said I'm going to use
[0:48] that this is not exactly the right way
[0:50] but I'm going to use that and then I'm
[0:54] going to bring them here and then I'm
[0:57] going to cause my word my voice to be
[1:01] heard by them and they're going to hear
[1:04] that they're going to believe that
[1:07] they're going to come to the second
[1:08] birth and be birth of the Son of
[1:11] [Applause]
[1:14] God and I'm going to call them
[1:19] amen by a super they they will believe
[1:22] it even when it's a it seems even when
[1:24] it seems mystical to them they're going
[1:26] to believe it they're going to believe
[1:27] it when they don't even understand why
[1:30] why they believe it when they can't even
[1:32] explain how they believe it or why they
[1:35] believe it or how they've come to this
[1:37] and and in the midst of all of this how
[1:39] do you believe it when when everybody's
[1:41] against it how do you believe it when
[1:43] you can't explain it how do you believe
[1:46] it when uh uh when it's obvious that the
[1:50] whole thing is
[1:53] crumbling you
[1:55] can't I don't
[1:57] know you may be one of the two men on
[2:00] the way to
[2:01] AAS you may be one of the others that
[2:05] didn't even get to the tomb you may be
[2:11] one and you hear all kinds of things and
[2:13] you hear that and you hear something
[2:15] else and it's it's not doesn't come to
[2:18] you till we rise up again and fortify
[2:21] ourselves and get o opposing views and
[2:26] opposing that has nothing to do with it
[2:30] just let it
[2:32] go you're in Luke
[2:34] 24 you're in a transition hallu just let
[2:38] it go don't pay any attention to it it's
[2:41] not worth your
[2:43] [Music]
[2:45] [Applause]
[2:46] time your mind wasn't made for
[2:50] doubt you believe I don't know why I
[2:53] believe I believe because I've been made
[2:54] to
[2:55] believe I'm made that way I'm
[2:58] constructed that way I came into the
[3:00] world to believe this
[3:03] [Applause]
[3:06] word in the sense of the word we can say
[3:08] it's a blind faith but but then when you
[3:11] understand and things that have been
[3:12] said this is such an incredible
[3:15] statement
