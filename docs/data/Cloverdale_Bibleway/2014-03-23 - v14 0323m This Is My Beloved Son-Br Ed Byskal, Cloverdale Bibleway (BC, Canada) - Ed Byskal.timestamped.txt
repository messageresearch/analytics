[11:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We'll ask the deacons to
[11:52] come forward, prepare for the morning
[11:54] offering.
[11:57] I ask brother Dave Chernoff if you'd
[11:59] come and lead us in to the throne of
[12:01] grace this morning.
[12:04] Couple prayer requests. Please uh Sister
[12:06] Clara
[12:07] Walman, I believe says, "Please pray for
[12:10] my cousin Annie in the colony. The
[12:13] doctors in Rochester found spots on her
[12:15] liver. She said I should ask the church
[12:17] to pray earnestly. She believes." So we
[12:20] want to do that this morning.
[12:25] Uh, Sister Ruth,
[12:29] I'm not sure which Sister Ruth that is,
[12:31] but please pray for my mother who's in
[12:33] the hospital with flu. Just want to
[12:36] remember that also in prayer. And any
[12:38] other needs that we have, we can bring
[12:40] them before the throne of grace this
[12:42] morning believing. Amen. Let's just ask
[12:45] brother Dave to come.
[12:47] [Music]
[12:53] Let's just bow our heads, saints. Our
[12:57] precious heavenly father, Lord, how we
[13:00] count it a great privilege once again to
[13:03] be found in the house of God this
[13:05] morning in your presence. Lord,
[13:08] &gt;&gt; we thank you for the opportunities to
[13:09] sing the songs of Zion one more time,
[13:12] Lord. That we are in the land of the
[13:15] living this morning. We have breath in
[13:16] our lungs that we can give our God
[13:19] praise and glory one more time. Father,
[13:22] we're so grateful, Lord, to be counted
[13:25] in this great number, Lord, of the
[13:27] redeemed this morning. The blood washed
[13:30] as we sang of that precious blood. Lord,
[13:33] still can wash a sinner whose vile,
[13:36] Lord, is white as snow this morning,
[13:38] Lord Jesus.
[13:40] Lord, we thank you for that blood that
[13:42] was shed at Calvary. Lord, it just
[13:45] washes us every day from the filth of
[13:47] this world. Lord,
[13:50] &gt;&gt; thank you for this
[13:52] gathering. Lord, the requests have been
[13:55] lifted up before you, our sister Claire
[13:57] and Sister Ruth, Lord, in these needs.
[14:00] Lord, and we stand agreeing as a body of
[14:02] people this morning, Lord. Scripture
[14:04] says that we would agree touching any
[14:06] one thing, Lord.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; They've asked the church to pray.
[14:09] They've showed confidence that Lord that
[14:13] you hear our prayers and you we believe
[14:15] you do hear our prayers Lord Jesus. So
[14:18] we lift our voices into that great altar
[14:22] of incense this morning Lord and in the
[14:25] and our prayers would ascend into your
[14:27] presence
[14:29] Lord and something would happen in the
[14:30] supernatural realm and you would send
[14:32] forth and dispatch healing virtue to
[14:36] these needs this morning. Lord, we
[14:38] believe that's your plan, your program.
[14:40] Lord, we utter that on our lips, Lord,
[14:42] and and God, you hear those prayers and
[14:46] you answer the heart of faith this
[14:48] morning, Lord. So, we agree for those
[14:50] needs, Lord. Pray that you'd get glory
[14:54] from it, Father. And may we hear a good
[14:55] report from it, Lord. We pray you meet
[14:58] every need also in divine presence. I'm
[15:00] sure there's many unspoken needs for
[15:03] sickness and health and and Lord
[15:06] spiritual needs and financial needs. We
[15:08] just touch everyone
[15:10] and Lord for your word for Lord we are
[15:13] just so anxious to sit at your table
[15:16] this morning Lord as eagles Lord we pray
[15:19] you'd break the fresh meat to us this
[15:22] morning. Take your servant as you have
[15:25] so many times faithfully over the years
[15:28] and the decades, Lord, and put your word
[15:31] in his mouth.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; Anoint him. Bless him. Father, we are
[15:36] just so anxious to hear what the spirit
[15:38] wants to say unto the church this
[15:39] morning. Meet every need in divine
[15:42] presence from the youngest to the
[15:43] oldest. Lord, we just completely open
[15:46] the doors of our souls this morning and
[15:48] say, "Heavenly Father, feed us, Lord,
[15:51] &gt;&gt; from the bread of life. We love you for
[15:54] it, Lord. And we commit the day to you
[15:56] now in Jesus name. Amen.

[18:45] verse once more.

[19:23] arms.
[19:26] I
[19:26] &gt;&gt; just have one announcement to make
[19:28] before they sing.
[19:30] Uh, brother Kale and sister K, brother
[19:32] Gil and sister Karen Ashdown would like

[19:36] wedding date of Sarah Anne Ashdown and
[19:39] Timothy Allen Dodd. The families would

[19:43] by extending a personal invitation to
[19:45] all those who attend this assembly. The
[19:47] wedding will take place Saturday, May

[19:52] following. And due to limited seating
[19:55] space, there will be an age limit of 18
[19:57] and over. Amen. God bless you.
[20:06] [Music]
[20:20] Through so many ders
[20:24] and toss of this life,
[20:28] I have already come.
[20:35] And he keeps on giving all the grace and
[20:40] the strength
[20:42] to just keep pressing
[20:46] on.
[20:49] He's given a promise and I am going to
[20:54] stand
[20:56] on every word his holy word has said.
[21:03] and holding his hand.
[21:07] I'll never fear
[21:11] whatever
[21:13] lies
[21:15] ahead.
[21:18] I'm
[21:20] going to make it.
[21:25] He's already said that I would.
[21:32] I'll

[21:38] that he's working everything for my
[21:41] good.
[21:45] He
[21:47] walks beside
[21:49] me
[21:52] and heaven is in my view.
[21:57] Oh,
[21:59] I'm
[22:00] going to make
[22:04] it
[22:05] through.
[22:12] In spite of the good
[22:15] intentions I've had,
[22:19] sometimes
[22:20] my strength can fade.
[22:25] And though I have tried the very best
[22:30] that I could,
[22:33] my weaknesses
[22:36] prevail.
[22:39] But then I remember the promise he gave
[22:46] that in my weakness
[22:49] strong.
[22:53] That's when I know
[22:55] whatever
[22:57] may come.
[22:59] His hand will lead me on.
[23:06] I'm
[23:08] going to make it.
[23:13] He's already said that I would.
[23:20] I'll
[23:21] keep on trusting
[23:25] that he's working everything for my
[23:29] good.
[23:33] He who walks beside
[23:37] me
[23:39] and heaven is in my view.
[23:45] Oh,
[23:46] I'm
[23:48] going to make
[23:51] it
[23:53] through.
[23:59] He
[24:01] walks beside
[24:03] me
[24:06] and heaven is in my view.
[24:11] Oh,
[24:13] I
[24:14] going to make
[24:18] it.
[24:20] He said I'll make
[24:24] it.
[24:26] I'm
[24:28] going to make
[24:32] it
[24:36] through.
[24:37] [Music]

[24:59] a baby dedication this morning for
[25:03] um the child of Brother Dominic and
[25:05] Sister Astred Sangamina. If they'd like
[25:08] to prepare as brother Ed also comes,
[25:10] we'll just sing this. I stand in awe
[25:12] within the presence of the Lord.
[25:15] [Music]
[25:16] I stand in awe within the presence of
[25:22] the Lord.

[28:52] [Music]
[28:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it wonderful?
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You may be seated.
[29:02] So important to worship him in spirit
[29:04] and in truth.
[29:06] And we're going to have a a baby
[29:09] dedication.
[29:10] Our brother Dominic and sister Astred
[29:13] Samina
[29:15] have their little one to be dedicated.
[29:20] So we're going to invite them if they
[29:22] would come please.
[29:32] This is the second son.
[29:35] It's one thing to have one son, but it's
[29:38] real honor have two sons.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:57] Praise the Lord.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Dominic.
[30:04] God bless you, Sister Astred.
[30:08] Now,
[30:09] you just come just a little way. I want
[30:11] the people to be able to look at you and
[30:12] see you.
[30:15] These people do things a little
[30:16] different.
[30:19] Brother Dominic came into my office and
[30:21] he said,
[30:23] "I feel it's time to get married."
[30:28] That's a wonderful revelation.
[30:32] And he said, I said, "Do you have
[30:33] someone in mind?" "Yes,
[30:36] there's a young lady and uh she's way in
[30:39] the Washington DC." "Oh, does she know
[30:43] anything about this?" No,
[30:46] but I'm going to tell her.
[30:51] And so he went and uh I had to inform
[30:55] them there was a church. Brother Wall's
[30:57] church is nearby.
[30:59] And uh in within a few days, Brother
[31:03] Dominic sends me an email says, "Praise
[31:06] the Lord." She said, "Yes,
[31:10] I got to shake hands with a man that got
[31:13] faith like that.
[31:15] Shake hands with a woman that responds
[31:17] to that faith." So, these two children
[31:20] are born into a wonderful family.
[31:23] Uh, the second son,
[31:27] Brother Dominic and Sister Astred, has
[31:31] named Gabriel Michael.
[31:34] And I thought I would just say there's
[31:35] we have other Michaels in the church and
[31:37] other Gabriels in the church,
[31:40] but now this couple felt to call their
[31:44] son after two archangels.
[31:48] I don't know what your thoughts were
[31:49] when you named your child that, but
[31:51] that's what their thoughts were.
[31:54] And uh
[31:57] there's been many people that have been
[31:59] named after other great people and many
[32:03] people are named after a location or a
[32:07] place and something I could tell you
[32:10] that you probably wouldn't know but
[32:12] brother Bud Southwick his second name is
[32:14] Dawson which is named after my hometown
[32:18] because I guess he was born there.
[32:20] People are named after great people,
[32:22] named after
[32:24] great places or places that mean
[32:27] something to them. And now you have
[32:29] named this son after two archangels.
[32:33] The scripture says, "And of Zion, it
[32:37] shall be said,
[32:39] this and that man was born in her, and
[32:42] the highest himself shall establish her.
[32:46] The Lord shall count when he writeth up
[32:48] the people that this man was born there.
[32:53] And so I am having confidence that
[32:57] before brother
[33:00] uh brother Dominic and sister Astrid
[33:03] named this child that perhaps the names
[33:08] of the archangels represent they come
[33:11] from a wonderful place. Number
[33:14] two, they dwelt in the presence of the
[33:17] Almighty God.
[33:20] Number three, their existence was for
[33:23] eternal purposes.
[33:26] And number four, I am praying that this
[33:30] may be the purpose of this boy, that he
[33:33] may dwell in the presence of the
[33:35] Almighty God, and that the Holy Spirit
[33:39] will be present with him and near him.
[33:42] And I know that your desire was that he
[33:45] might fulfill a place in God's kingdom.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; May his life on earth
[33:53] have an eternal purpose and glorify God.
[33:57] And may this son Gabriel Michael
[34:02] uh who announced Gabriel announced the
[34:06] birth and conception of Jesus Christ.
[34:08] And he was the first one. I don't know
[34:11] how he conveyed it but he said now shall
[34:13] call his name Jesus
[34:16] and from that Mary was the first mortal
[34:18] person to say that name. She had
[34:21] received it direct from this archangel
[34:24] Gabriel. Tell you they have important
[34:26] places and
[34:29] we're at a
[34:31] quite a time in history and may this son
[34:36] grow up. Brother Brandham was praying
[34:38] for a son
[34:41] that came up from dedication
[34:44] and he was started to speak about
[34:45] Gabriel and he said, "You announced his
[34:48] first coming and you shall announce his
[34:50] second."
[34:52] In all of God's treasures, that is the
[34:55] greatest thing. What is the greatest
[34:57] thing that you found? And it's like he's
[34:58] in a conversation. He's asking Gabriel,
[35:01] "What's the greatest thing that you've
[35:02] found?" And he receives the answer. And
[35:06] life is the greatest thing that there
[35:08] is.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; God has given you a life to care for.
[35:15] And he prayed and I'm just going to read
[35:17] his prayer. Our heavenly father, we come
[35:21] with little Michael
[35:24] and we place our hands upon him in
[35:27] dedication of Jesus Christ.
[35:31] You placed this in their care, in the
[35:34] parents care.
[35:36] and they know that they are insufficient
[35:38] without your help. So they bring their
[35:41] little family to dedicate them. And now
[35:43] I give little Michael here to you for a
[35:46] life of service in Jesus Christ's name.
[35:49] And bless the father and mother and may
[35:51] they live long happy lives to see their
[35:53] children in service of God. And we ask
[35:56] this blessing for the glory of God. And
[35:59] it's with that prayer I'm going to
[36:02] receive your son to pray for him and to
[36:05] dedicate him to God.
[36:08] Heavenly Father, this mother and father,
[36:11] our brother Dominic and sister Astrid
[36:13] have bought their son Gabriel Michael.
[36:16] You gave him to them
[36:20] and they may feel insufficient to care
[36:22] for him the way they ought to, but I
[36:24] pray you will guide them by the Holy
[36:25] Spirit.
[36:26] I pray that you'll give this son a
[36:29] healthy body, that you'll keep him
[36:32] strong. I pray you'll give him a mind
[36:35] that will understand and ears to hear
[36:38] the voice of the Holy Spirit. That you
[36:41] make real yourself to him when he comes
[36:44] of age. And may he sense your presence
[36:47] in the home, oh God. This home, this
[36:50] Sangamina home. I pray you'll bless it.
[36:53] Father, I ask, oh God, your protection
[36:57] upon this son. And I pray that you'll
[37:00] use him. May he realize, oh God, that
[37:03] this life has come from a sacred place.
[37:06] And may he come to this world for a a a
[37:09] divine purpose. And may he live if time
[37:12] shall go on to be an example to others,
[37:15] to his peers. And now I dedicate him to
[37:18] you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:22] and for his glory. Amen.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, Sister Astred.
[37:30] God bless you, brother Dominic. Amen.
[37:37] Hallelujah.
[37:46] Well, we got a I got a text from Sister
[37:50] Rael
[37:51] Russell yesterday and informing us that
[37:55] her mother had been promoted
[37:58] to be a young woman again.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Sister Semler went to be in the presence
[38:03] of the Lord on Friday morning sometime
[38:06] between 6:00 and 9. I don't know exactly
[38:08] when and we we don't have any more
[38:11] information than that but she just said
[38:13] that uh that we had contributed so much
[38:16] to their lives and to their spiritual
[38:20] uh spiritual lives and they just wanted
[38:22] us to know so if we hear anything
[38:24] further as we hear it we will let you
[38:26] know and perhaps post it on the board.
[38:32] Amen. So we're happy for sister Samler.
[38:36] We're
[38:37] uh certainly I I don't know if we can
[38:40] rejoice as much as she's rejoicing.
[38:42] Won't it be wonderful when when we are
[38:45] there?
[38:47] &gt;&gt; All done.
[38:49] All done. Uh labors and toils and but
[38:52] while we're here, we want to do what's
[38:54] right and what our very best. Amen. I'll
[38:58] ask you to stand if you would and we're
[39:00] going to have prayer and then turn to
[39:02] the word of God. We'll be reading out of
[39:04] Matthew the 3r chapter and also the 17th
[39:07] chapter.
[39:09] But before we read, let's just have a
[39:12] word of prayer.
[39:14] Father, we have been invited to pray.
[39:17] Lord Jesus, you even taught us how to
[39:20] pray that we should address the Almighty
[39:24] as our father which art in heaven. We
[39:28] say with all that is within us, hallowed
[39:30] be thy name.
[39:33] And oh God, our we express our desire
[39:36] not just in words but with everything
[39:38] that's in us. Thy kingdom come and thy
[39:41] will be done on earth as it is in
[39:44] heaven. Father, we see a earth that is
[39:46] filled with violence and turmoil and
[39:48] questions. But we pray that your kingdom
[39:51] come, the kingdom of trust, the kingdom
[39:55] of holiness and justice and equality. We
[39:58] pray oh God that thy kingdom come. pray
[40:01] you'll forgive us, oh God, our sins, our
[40:04] failings and weaknesses as we forgive
[40:06] others our their trespasses against us.
[40:09] And I pray, oh God, that you will be
[40:12] glorified. And for your yours is all of
[40:15] the power and the glory in the name of
[40:18] our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, as we turn
[40:20] the pages of this book called the Bible,
[40:24] we know clearly, Lord, that anyone with
[40:27] any strength can turn it, but only you
[40:30] can reveal it.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; We pray and trust that the Holy Spirit
[40:34] will now take, oh God, the vessels as I
[40:37] stand here to speak. I pray that you
[40:39] will anoint the word, oh God. Anoint the
[40:42] thoughts. I pray you will inspire the
[40:45] people. Father, may they be receptive to
[40:48] hear and more than that, may they may
[40:51] may they be illuminated to see, oh God,
[40:54] the time and the season that we are in.
[40:57] In the name of Jesus Christ, we look to
[41:00] you now, Lord, and we say, "Have thine
[41:03] own way, Lord. We are the we are the
[41:07] clay. You're the potter. Mold us as you
[41:11] would and glor be glorified in Jesus
[41:14] name. Amen.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:18] We pray God will bless those that are
[41:20] away. And yet, I don't know whether I
[41:22] want to pray too big a blessing on them
[41:24] away. I pray that God will bless them
[41:27] with the desire to be home, be here.
[41:30] Amen. But they have spring break. And I
[41:32] I know that's something new in in my
[41:34] books. I uh we never had spring break.
[41:37] So, uh, and I always try to arrange
[41:39] things so I'm home here or home at the
[41:43] at the post of duty, whatever that is.
[41:46] Always wanted to have my family in
[41:48] church. I think it's the best place you
[41:50] can be.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do I hear it from you?
[41:54] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we'll turn to Matthew's
[41:56] Gospel.
[41:58] I want to read the third chapter.
[42:02] Uh, Matthew 3 16 and 17. And then we'll
[42:06] go to chapter 17 and read verses 1-5.
[42:13] And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up
[42:16] straightway out of the water, and lo,
[42:19] the heavens were opened unto him, and he
[42:22] saw the spirit of God descending like a
[42:25] dove and lighting upon him. and lo a
[42:29] voice from heaven saying, "This is my
[42:33] beloved son in whom I am well pleased."
[42:37] In Matthew 17
[42:40] verse one,
[42:45] and after six days Jesus taketh Peter,
[42:48] James, and John his brother, and
[42:51] bringeth them up into the into a high
[42:54] high mountain apart, and was
[42:56] transfigured before them, and his face
[42:58] did shine as the sun, and his raignment
[43:01] was white as the light. And behold,
[43:04] there appeared unto them Moses and Elias
[43:08] talking with him. Then answered Peter,
[43:11] and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good
[43:14] for us to be here. If thou wilt, let us
[43:17] make here three tabernacles,
[43:19] one for thee, one for Moses, and one for
[43:23] Elias. And while he yet spake, behold, a
[43:26] bright cloud overshadowed them. And
[43:29] behold, a voice out of the cloud which
[43:32] said, "This is my beloved son in whom I
[43:38] am well pleased."
[43:40] I want to speak on
[43:42] uh this is my beloved son. And this will
[43:46] be almost like a part two. If you're a
[43:49] real alert, you could perhaps make some
[43:53] links together with a message I spoke
[43:56] just recently,
[43:58] guardians of the revelation of the son
[44:00] of man. Because I would like to put the
[44:04] emphasis upon Jesus Christ as a son of
[44:08] man, as a son of God, and as the son of
[44:13] David. God knew that he was going to
[44:16] manifest himself
[44:18] &gt;&gt; in this vessel.
[44:20] And I have quite a bit to say about
[44:22] that. And then he was going to manifest
[44:25] himself and not confusing as the woman
[44:29] who came and cried to him, Jesus, thou
[44:32] son of David. And he didn't respond to
[44:35] her because he was not the son of David
[44:37] to her. Then she said, Lord, and he gave
[44:41] her her request. And then uh I want to
[44:45] also emphasize, excuse me for having you
[44:48] stand just another moment. I want to
[44:50] emphasize
[44:52] that if this is the son and he is the
[44:56] one that is revealing almighty God,
[45:00] then why should people look? If he is
[45:04] the word and they have the word, why do
[45:07] we look for another?
[45:10] or why do we become distracted to other
[45:13] persons or other personalities
[45:16] and the world is full of it.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; World is full of it. And I'll be saying
[45:21] some more about that. You may have your
[45:23] seats.
[45:33] Brother Benham said concerning the
[45:34] message,
[45:37] the message which God had called him to
[45:40] bring,
[45:41] he said, "I I may not do it, but this
[45:45] message will introduce Jesus Christ to
[45:48] the world."
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. For as John the Baptist was sent
[45:52] to forerun the first coming, so is this
[45:56] message the message to forerun the
[45:58] second coming. That's just an
[46:00] introduction. Think about that now.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; So, has he been introduced or hasn't he
[46:07] been introduced?
[46:09] Now
[46:12] uh
[46:16] so if this in this message who is God.
[46:21] So he first was God. I just want to I
[46:25] want to lay a a foundation for some
[46:27] moments here. So he first was God
[46:30] Jehovah. And out of him he said, "Let's
[46:34] just picture now a little drama so you
[46:37] can get uh get it. Let's see coming out
[46:41] of space where there's nothing. Let's
[46:44] make a little white light like a mystic
[46:47] light halo." And that was the logos that
[46:52] went out of God in the beginning. That
[46:56] was the son of God that came out of the
[47:00] bosom of the father. That's what John
[47:03] the Baptist had said. Came out of the
[47:06] bosom of the father. And that was that
[47:10] was what was in the beginning
[47:13] was the word. And the word was with God.
[47:17] And the word was God. And the word was
[47:22] made flesh and dwelt among us. In the
[47:25] beginning was God and then out of God
[47:30] came the logos a part of God that went
[47:33] out of God.
[47:35] This friends
[47:38] is the son.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; This is the person.
[47:44] This is the person.
[47:46] This is the key person. Everything else
[47:50] that is taking place in the world is
[47:52] almost almost irrelevant.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; And almighty God would say this
[48:03] &gt;&gt; is my beloved son.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him.
[48:09] It's really amazing that we have
[48:12] institutions and thousands of
[48:16] organizations and whatever more
[48:20] &gt;&gt; and all declaring to have the absolute
[48:22] truth.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; And yet God would take one man
[48:27] and identify him
[48:30] &gt;&gt; and to the people. Now it's not simple.
[48:33] It's not simple because for John the
[48:37] Baptist to be there and as far as the
[48:39] people was concerned here come Jesus
[48:40] walking who in their minds Joseph was
[48:45] Jesus uh father
[48:47] &gt;&gt; and Mary his mother don't we have them
[48:50] here and John was his cousin
[48:54] &gt;&gt; and John is standing in the water doing
[48:56] something that has never been done
[48:57] before they don't have any record in the
[48:59] Torah or in the in the Bible that
[49:02] existed at the time of baptism taking
[49:04] place and and someone speaking the way
[49:07] he was and calling all the religious
[49:10] leaders and righteous people and the
[49:12] brother Brandham says he couldn't even
[49:14] put their finger on their life, their
[49:15] father's life, their grandfathers or
[49:17] great greatgrandfather's life. They had
[49:20] had such a holy lineage. And then he
[49:22] says, "Ye vipers,
[49:25] &gt;&gt; who's going to understand that?
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Who's going to accept that?" And yet
[49:29] there was some there was some intensity
[49:32] and some power in what he was saying and
[49:34] some conviction that was backing it up
[49:38] and and so the people were startled and
[49:40] they were coming to the water and and he
[49:42] says behold the lamb of God that takes
[49:44] away the sin of the world. Tell me who's
[49:47] going to understand that?
[49:48] &gt;&gt; If God wasn't helping you then you'd
[49:51] never catch it. And if God doesn't help
[49:54] you now, you'll never catch it.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it.
[49:59] There was always ample ample reason.
[50:02] I've been reading about this transition
[50:04] period.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Uh the transition period from son of man
[50:08] which was the his prophet office to son
[50:11] of god. God is the spirit. So he was a
[50:14] son of god in the ages of the of the uh
[50:17] dispensation of the new testament all
[50:20] that period all that era son of god. And
[50:23] at the end of that there's the son of
[50:25] David. And then the prophet says, "And
[50:27] then just between he reveals himself
[50:30] again as the son of man." Jesus said
[50:32] that. Luke 17:30, "When you see the days
[50:34] of Noah again, we got them."
[50:37] &gt;&gt; When you see the days of Sodom again, we
[50:40] got them.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Even thus will it be in the day not
[50:43] localized as it was Sodom and Gomorrah
[50:45] at that time or Noah at that time. But
[50:48] when you see the days when you see that
[50:50] in a global
[50:52] &gt;&gt; in a global manner and there nobody
[50:55] today that has open eyes that would that
[50:58] would deny
[50:59] &gt;&gt; it's here.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; It's in my town. It's in your village.
[51:03] It's in your community. It's all over.
[51:06] It's in the airplane. It's in the
[51:08] restaurants. It's everywhere. It's on
[51:10] the streets. It's in parades. It's being
[51:13] published about. These are those days.
[51:16] Even thus shall it be when the son of
[51:18] man shall be revealed.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; And now you have a prophet coming on the
[51:22] scene doing exactly the same thing.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Appearing out of a a place of simplicity
[51:28] and and with a simple speech and coming
[51:31] amongst a common people but showing the
[51:34] sign of Messiah and the sign of the
[51:36] resurrection doing what man cannot do.
[51:39] Amen.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; There's been all kinds of prophets rise,
[51:42] but they don't stand there as some that
[51:44] I I will tell you even today before we
[51:46] have another baby dedication tonight.
[51:48] But standing there and and and telling
[51:51] people that standing total strangers to
[51:53] them
[51:54] &gt;&gt; and this is your name
[51:56] &gt;&gt; and this is your address,
[51:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:59] &gt;&gt; And you have a lump on your breast and
[52:01] and or or to someone else that you've
[52:04] had an operation, it didn't go well.
[52:07] talking to a woman in the congregation.
[52:09] Oh, that poor woman. You've had one,
[52:12] two, three, four, five operations
[52:16] and they didn't find out what the
[52:18] problem was. Feeling a compassion for
[52:21] her and said they couldn't find it. But
[52:24] that devil can't hide from God.
[52:28] Who's doing that? The son of man is
[52:31] doing that. Not don't be distracted to
[52:34] the vessel. And then he would even say,
[52:36] "Don't look at me. It's not me. It's
[52:39] him."
[52:41] &gt;&gt; And it was him that people were failing
[52:43] to see. Amen.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Even in Moses time, in Moses time and
[52:48] 2,000 years or not, perhaps 1600 years
[52:51] after Moses was present, here come a a
[52:54] class of people and they they just
[52:56] studied the word and they studied what
[52:58] Moses and they studied all the
[53:00] commandments and kept all the
[53:02] commandments, kept it without flawlessly
[53:05] kept it. And then when Jesus, this young
[53:09] prophet of of from Nazareth would come
[53:12] and they would say uh about Moses, we we
[53:15] we hear Moses, this is what Moses said.
[53:19] And they and Jesus said, "If you heard
[53:21] what Moses said, you'd believe me."
[53:24] &gt;&gt; They spoke of what what Moses said. But
[53:26] then Jesus spoke about what the voice
[53:29] said in the burning bush.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; That was another person. Yeah,
[53:34] &gt;&gt; they were talking about Moses.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; But he'd say when Moses stood before the
[53:38] burning bush,
[53:40] &gt;&gt; the voice said,
[53:41] &gt;&gt; "I am the God of Abraham,
[53:44] &gt;&gt; of Isaac, and of Jacob,
[53:46] &gt;&gt; he's a God of the living, not a God of
[53:48] the dead,
[53:53] &gt;&gt; so it's very very significant, very
[53:55] important that we don't become
[53:57] distracted. uh we regard offices, we
[54:00] regard positions, we regard ministries,
[54:04] we regard those things and I believe
[54:06] it's proper to give them their proper
[54:08] place and then their proper respect. But
[54:11] on the other hand, we never want to get
[54:14] be distracted away from this is my son
[54:20] &gt;&gt; and that son was the word of God made
[54:23] flesh and that's what I want to get
[54:25] into.
[54:29] It is said in John 1:18,
[54:32] "No man hath seen God at any time,
[54:35] &gt;&gt; the only begotten son, which is in the
[54:39] bosom of the father, he hath declared
[54:43] him."
[54:47] &gt;&gt; I just want to refer to the first
[54:49] creation for a moment. I've got to take
[54:51] you on a bit of a journey and I'm going
[54:53] to watch my time.
[54:56] Adam was his first created son. Brother
[54:59] Bren saying this in power in power of
[55:03] transformation.
[55:05] Adam was his first created son.
[55:10] Jesus was his only begotten son.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; See, he was begotten by a woman.
[55:20] Adam was not begotten.
[55:22] Jesus had to be begotten by a woman
[55:25] because he came to deal with sin.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; But Adam was straight from the hand of
[55:31] God in the creation.
[55:35] And God's word calls for total
[55:36] separation. Just laying a case now. The
[55:40] first man, Adam, was separated himself
[55:43] from the word to go with his wife.
[55:46] That's the next step.
[55:48] And that questioned whether God kept his
[55:51] word or not.
[55:53] But when the second Adam was created in
[55:56] the womb of a woman and came to the
[55:59] world, he was a Nazerite to the word of
[56:02] God. He was separated from the world to
[56:06] the word.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; So the first one was separated from the
[56:10] word to the world
[56:13] &gt;&gt; and the second one was separated from
[56:15] the world to God
[56:17] &gt;&gt; to the word.
[56:19] and Nazerite to the word of God. He was
[56:21] separated from the world to the word.
[56:25] And then in thirsting for life, the
[56:27] logos that went out of God, the word of
[56:32] eternal sunship of God, the word, he's
[56:35] referring to the word of eternal sunship
[56:38] of God. The word doesn't even make sense
[56:41] to me.
[56:42] The word eternal means eternity
[56:45] &gt;&gt; which had no beginning or has no end.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; And son means had a beginning.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; It could be a eternal godship
[57:00] but never an eternal sunship.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; A son is one that's begotten so it has a
[57:06] beginning. Yes.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; For God so loved the world that he gave
[57:12] his only begotten son
[57:16] that whosoever believeth on him should
[57:18] not perish but have everlasting life. He
[57:23] gave his only begotten son. It was the
[57:26] world that needed saving friends.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; So God gave his begotten son. He was
[57:33] begotten. He was birthed. He was born of
[57:35] a woman.
[57:40] I I'm glad you're thinking.
[57:43] The body of Jesus Christ. Now, we're
[57:46] going to get into some swimming water.
[57:49] If you have a question, I'd be very,
[57:51] very happy for you to write it down. But
[57:55] the body of Jesus Christ was taken from
[57:59] the cursed earth
[58:02] when Adam sinned. When the serpent sub
[58:07] seduced the woman and sin was committed,
[58:14] Adam, the serpent was cursed.
[58:19] The woman was not cursed,
[58:22] but she would she would bring forth
[58:24] children in sorrow
[58:27] and in pain and in conception.
[58:31] But the man was not cursed. Adam was not
[58:34] cursed, but the earth was cursed.
[58:38] And then he said, "Because thou hast
[58:41] done this,
[58:43] uh, from dust thou hast come and to dust
[58:46] thou shalt return."
[58:49] And he was taken a body of the earth,
[58:52] &gt;&gt; cursed earth
[58:54] &gt;&gt; for a body.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; And so the germ of life and Christ is
[59:00] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[59:02] So the germ of life in this case came
[59:05] from Jehovah speaking of the begotten
[59:07] son. The germ of life of in this case
[59:11] came from Jehovah God the father of
[59:14] Jesus Christ the great creator. And you
[59:18] believe that he created in the womb of
[59:22] this little virgin girl a blood cell
[59:25] that developed into the son of the
[59:28] living God.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was the son of the living God.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Came from a a a new creation. Thus Jesus
[59:37] could say that thus sayeth the beginning
[59:40] of the creation of God.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, if that wasn't the
[59:45] beginning of a new creation, then then
[59:48] we're only part of an old creation.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; There has to be a new creation. And
[59:53] that's why there's a new birth.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:57] And a new birth is more important than
[59:59] the birth that brought you sitting here.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; We're all here because we've been
[1:00:03] begotten of a woman.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; We had a birth.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Nobody's here without a birth. Nobody's
[1:00:10] here without a father of some kind.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; But Jesus, his father, was almighty God.
[1:00:16] And God began another creation
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; through a virgin birth
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; and brought forth a man child.
[1:00:26] And the mother would eat of the things
[1:00:28] of the earth out of a cursed earth
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; and formed a body
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; for Jesus Christ, the son of God. And
[1:00:38] when he was birthed, he he uh was
[1:00:43] tempted in all points like we are.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; He got hungry.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; He got tired.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; He would go to sleep.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; He did all things that we humans do.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Because he had a body. But the
[1:01:00] difference was God was in Christ.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Manifesting himself. Amen.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Showing his attributes.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; God was a healer. Thus Jesus healed.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; God was a deliverer. Thus he Jesus
[1:01:16] delivered people.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; God was a creator. Thus Jesus created.
[1:01:22] He was manifesting. We couldn't
[1:01:24] understand this God that fills all time
[1:01:26] and space. How can we understand that?
[1:01:29] And if we could go back trillions and
[1:01:31] trillions of years, you can't understand
[1:01:33] that God had to come down and tabernacle
[1:01:37] himself with us poor humans born in sin
[1:01:41] and shapen in iniquities and show us
[1:01:44] that there is another life, there's
[1:01:46] another creation. And he stood here and
[1:01:49] it took a revelation from God to
[1:01:52] understand that that man was from
[1:01:54] another realm.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; He didn't come from Joseph. He came from
[1:01:59] heaven
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; and Mary just carried that seed
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; and brought forth the righteous one
[1:02:10] Jesus Christ.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; So now watch please. So the sentence was
[1:02:17] not upon Adam but the sentence was that
[1:02:20] he would return to the ground from which
[1:02:23] he was taken. That was the sentence. And
[1:02:26] that's why the second Adam had to take
[1:02:29] that earth
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; to death.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; But he never turned to dust.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; He was one that was born of a woman
[1:02:42] whose body never went to dust.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; And when they went to the seurel,
[1:02:49] the body, they couldn't find the body.
[1:02:51] Why do you seek the living amongst the
[1:02:53] dead? The body was gone. He had to take
[1:02:56] the body to death
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; and pierce death
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; and come back victorious over death
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; so that he could say because I live you
[1:03:08] shall live also.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Otherwise those words are meaningless if
[1:03:13] he just was born of a man. But not only
[1:03:16] was he born of a of a seed, a righteous
[1:03:19] seed, but it was equally important that
[1:03:21] he should take that body
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; of the earth
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; which had been cursed.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; And so the Bible says, "Cursed is he
[1:03:30] that hangeth on a tree." He took the
[1:03:32] curse to the tree.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:38] And the last word of the Old Testament,
[1:03:43] the last word in the Old Testament,
[1:03:47] and the last promises, behold, I will
[1:03:49] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[1:03:51] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[1:03:54] the Lord. And he shall he shall
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; turn the heart of the fathers to the
[1:04:00] children,
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; which is John the Baptist, and the heart
[1:04:04] of the children to their fathers,
[1:04:07] another prophet at the end of the age.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Lest I come and smite the earth with a
[1:04:13] curse.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; The last word of the Old Testament, lest
[1:04:17] I smite it with a curse, this ministry
[1:04:20] must come.
[1:04:23] This revelation of this son, this son,
[1:04:27] my beloved son, he will be revealed in a
[1:04:30] prophet's ministry. And thus came a
[1:04:33] message in this hour. Thus came a
[1:04:36] vindicated prophet in this hour that
[1:04:39] stood before the multitudes of people
[1:04:41] and performed the same things that Jesus
[1:04:44] Christ did in his first coming. He had
[1:04:46] to do it in the second coming.
[1:04:49] lest I come and smite the earth with a
[1:04:52] curse. Because he had to reveal there
[1:04:54] was a revelation of this one,
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; this son of man, son of God, son of
[1:05:00] David.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; And my message title last time was you
[1:05:05] are guardians
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; of this revelation.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; You're to live it.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; You're to be a true witness of the true
[1:05:14] vine.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; You're not a witness of a denomination.
[1:05:17] You're not a witness of some Bible
[1:05:19] school. You're a witness of the true
[1:05:22] vine.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; He who stood here and said, "I'm the
[1:05:26] true vine."
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; By saying true vine means there's false
[1:05:30] vine
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; and there's others that can be grafted
[1:05:34] in.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; We're not tangelos or lemons
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; in an orange tree. And he said, "If the
[1:05:45] prophet said, if this tree ever puts
[1:05:47] forth another bud, it'll be an original
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; book of Acts church."
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; And that's why I'm thankful I can stand
[1:05:55] behind this desk today and say we are
[1:05:58] seeing a Holy Ghost book of Acts church.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; We're seeing it.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; I sent email this morning to Uganda.
[1:06:12] We heard Wednesday night. Those you
[1:06:14] haven't heard Wednesday night, if you
[1:06:16] want to get on the archives and hear our
[1:06:18] brother Murphy just speak of the last
[1:06:20] three months that he spent in China.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, we cannot hear
[1:06:24] that and realize that we're just hearing
[1:06:26] a little tidbit
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; of what God is doing.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Our brother's sitting up here
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; right behind that glass interpreting
[1:06:35] this now in Chinese. And it's not this
[1:06:38] ministry. It's not this man. We are only
[1:06:40] guardians of a message which revealed
[1:06:43] Jesus Christ. And you as a church are
[1:06:46] called to be witnesses of that message.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Witnesses of this revelation of Jesus
[1:06:53] Christ.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Things that perhaps are ordinary to you.
[1:06:57] They're not ordinary to a lot of people.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; And so he took the earth. The Bible
[1:07:05] says, "And out of Adam he said, because
[1:07:08] thou hast hearkened unto the voice of
[1:07:10] thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of
[1:07:13] which I commanded thee, saying, Thou
[1:07:15] shalt not eat of it, cursed is the
[1:07:18] ground for thy sake, and in sorrow shalt
[1:07:22] thou eat of it all the days of thy life.
[1:07:25] And in the sweat of thy face shalt thou
[1:07:27] eat bread till thou return unto the
[1:07:29] ground. For out of it thou was taken.
[1:07:33] For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt
[1:07:36] thou return. There isn't anybody here
[1:07:38] that that's a shock to. We've all been
[1:07:41] to a funeral of some kind. When we're
[1:07:44] children, we don't understand. I
[1:07:46] certainly understand. And I don't want
[1:07:49] to repeat this again, but I was six and
[1:07:51] a half standing in front of my mother's
[1:07:53] casket. and knowing
[1:07:56] something was terribly wrong. Three days
[1:07:59] ago she was here.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Three days ago we were a happy family
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; and suddenly someone comes to the school
[1:08:06] takes me out of grade 1 says mother has
[1:08:09] been taken to heaven.
[1:08:11] I couldn't understand that. And somebody
[1:08:14] a woman took some big Easter lilies. It
[1:08:17] was in the springtime and broke off one
[1:08:19] and put my hands together and stuck that
[1:08:22] Easter lily in my hand. And I'm looking
[1:08:23] at this big white Easter lily looking at
[1:08:26] the gray cloth coffin
[1:08:30] that my mom at 32 years old picture of
[1:08:33] perfect health
[1:08:35] beautiful
[1:08:36] mother
[1:08:38] and glorious Christian saved out of
[1:08:41] Catholicism out of the depths of
[1:08:43] Catholic dartless and only a short time
[1:08:46] and God just took her.
[1:08:49] I didn't know a lot of things. I didn't
[1:08:51] understand all the mysteries. I didn't
[1:08:52] all I could in my young heart I remember
[1:08:55] distinctly looking at that lily looking
[1:08:57] at that coffin something's terribly
[1:08:59] wrong.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; This isn't what was this isn't the way
[1:09:04] it was meant to be.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; That's all I know.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; I thank God for the message.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; I thank God for the sign of Messiah.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; I thank God for the sign of the
[1:09:16] resurrection. I thank God that one who
[1:09:19] came with that kind of indication could
[1:09:21] say this is the evidence of the
[1:09:23] resurrection and this is the evidence
[1:09:26] that he who is dead is alive today not
[1:09:29] back in history today
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; and that I could say he that is alive
[1:09:35] this is my beloved son and this is the
[1:09:37] one this congregation needs to see
[1:09:40] anyone hearing my voice that's the one
[1:09:42] our eyes must be on and he is the word
[1:09:47] He is the revealed word and he'll never
[1:09:49] be anything else. He's the revealed
[1:09:51] word. There is a message a re a message
[1:09:55] that reveals him
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; and there's a message that unveils the
[1:09:59] serpent unveils the original sin.
[1:10:02] Unveils the godhead.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:13] And so he says, "Out of your ground," I
[1:10:16] have to just stop or I would be
[1:10:18] preaching.
[1:10:19] "Out of the ground, out of dust thou art
[1:10:22] and to dust thou shalt return,
[1:10:25] and his body will return to the ground,
[1:10:28] but the second Adam will come to redeem
[1:10:31] it." Yes.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; The fallen nature,
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; his fallen nature and the whole earth by
[1:10:38] taking a body of the earth and bringing
[1:10:40] it subject to the original nature
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; and bringing it subject. Listen friends,
[1:10:46] when the Apostle Paul says, "I I bring
[1:10:48] my body under and and many of you that
[1:10:51] are young men and young women, I can
[1:10:54] tell you that the power of
[1:10:56] transformation
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; by the by the living Christ who is the
[1:11:00] revealed word of God can can has power
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; more than sufficient
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; to keep a man and to keep a woman and to
[1:11:09] keep a family." Amen.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; And so God God be now I want to I want
[1:11:17] you to see you see not just not just the
[1:11:21] seed that was created in the womb of the
[1:11:23] Mary
[1:11:25] but there was a faith lineage and God
[1:11:28] gave a promise to Abraham
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; going to give you a son.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Now think please think with me.
[1:11:36] Here's Abraham
[1:11:38] chapter 18 of Genesis. He's out in the
[1:11:40] heat of the day sitting in the says
[1:11:42] three men coming. He identifies them as
[1:11:45] my Lord
[1:11:48] and two go to Sodom and one remains with
[1:11:51] Abraham.
[1:11:53] And he does exactly what's been done in
[1:11:55] public today hundreds of times. Where's
[1:11:58] Abraham, your wife?
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Said she's in the tent behind you. I sat
[1:12:04] in the service right over here in Port
[1:12:06] El Bernie where brother Brandham was
[1:12:07] standing there and turned his back and
[1:12:10] I've done this. He looked up at the up
[1:12:12] at the gable of the place and he said
[1:12:13] there's a man there's a man uh behind me
[1:12:17] is praying for a man that's paralyzed. I
[1:12:19] knew the man behind him. I knew the man
[1:12:21] who was paralyzed. I thought the man
[1:12:23] that was paralyzed was up in a house.
[1:12:25] That was the last place he was. The man
[1:12:27] who was sitting right beside me had
[1:12:29] visited him that morning in Port El
[1:12:31] Bernie. And brother Brandham said, "The
[1:12:33] man's not here in this city." He said,
[1:12:35] "He's paralyzed and he's in a city, I
[1:12:39] believe it's called Nanimo."
[1:12:42] He'd been taken to Nanimo that
[1:12:45] afternoon.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; "What is this? Is this work
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; or is this the son of man?"
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Not the man. He's the vessel. Don't look
[1:12:56] at me, he said. Look at him
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; because that's the word of truth coming
[1:13:03] out
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; and he wheels around says, "Isn't that
[1:13:06] right, Mike?"
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; And I knew Mike,
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; a native brother.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Hundreds of times.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Bombay saw it. Durban saw it.
[1:13:18] Johannesburg saw it. Houston saw it.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Saskatoon saw it. Prince Albert saw it.
[1:13:24] Edmonton saw it. All over the country.
[1:13:27] all over the country. How many times
[1:13:29] like Tommy Osbborne says, "How many
[1:13:31] times do you need to say it?"
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "I saw it once."
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends?
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; That's that's the vessel through which
[1:13:45] God said he would reveal the son of man,
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; a prophet ministry. We're not prophets.
[1:13:51] We don't have that
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; and we don't want to have the
[1:13:55] responsibility of it.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; But he could not be persuaded by money.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; He could not be persuaded by
[1:14:02] organizations.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; All kinds of organizations wanted for
[1:14:06] membership.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; He's not interested in membership.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; We're interested in godship.
[1:14:12] [Applause]
[1:14:15] And so God begins to prepare a body way
[1:14:19] back there, a faith seed
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; because the sin came by doubting.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; And now God, listen to me real close
[1:14:30] now. And now God would take a
[1:14:35] born begotten of a woman and born in sin
[1:14:39] and shapen in iniquity. But there would
[1:14:41] be a an election within them. There
[1:14:44] would be a a seed within them. There
[1:14:47] would be a predestinated
[1:14:49] seed within them. There would be a force
[1:14:51] within them that would bring that body
[1:14:54] subject
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; to the faith that was in them.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; And they believed God.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; I don't know why. I don't know how. But
[1:15:02] the Bible says, "And Abraham believed
[1:15:04] God."
[1:15:06] And so the Bible says this, and you know
[1:15:09] the verses real well, and I'm going to
[1:15:11] just say it quickly as you give me your
[1:15:14] full attention.
[1:15:17] By faith, Abel
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; offered to God a more excellent
[1:15:21] sacrifice than Cain. By faith, Enoch
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; was translated when he that he should
[1:15:28] not say death. By faith, Noah, being
[1:15:31] warned of things not yet seen, moved
[1:15:34] with fear, prepared an ark to the saving
[1:15:37] of his house. By faith, Abraham, when he
[1:15:40] was called to go out into a place which
[1:15:43] he should after receive for an
[1:15:45] inheritance, obeyed through faith also
[1:15:48] Sarah received receive strength to
[1:15:51] conceive seed. Therefore, therefore says
[1:15:55] these all died in faith, not having
[1:15:58] received the promise. By faith, Abraham
[1:16:01] when he was tried, he offered up Isaac.
[1:16:04] By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau
[1:16:07] concerning things to come. By faith,
[1:16:10] Jacob, when he was dying, blessed both
[1:16:12] the sons of Joseph. By faith, Joseph,
[1:16:15] when he died, made mention of departing
[1:16:18] of the children of Israel, and gave
[1:16:20] commandments concerning his bones. By
[1:16:22] faith, Moses when he was born was hid
[1:16:25] three months by his parents. By faith,
[1:16:28] Moses when he came to years refused to
[1:16:31] be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[1:16:34] By faith, the walls of Jericho fell with
[1:16:37] Joshua uh marching around it. By faith,
[1:16:40] the harlot Rahab perished not with them
[1:16:44] that believed not. And what shall I say
[1:16:47] more? For the time would fail me to tell
[1:16:50] of Gideon, and of Barack, and of Samson,
[1:16:53] and of Jeth, and of David, and of
[1:16:55] Samuel, and the prophets, who through
[1:16:57] faith subdued kingdoms, and wrought
[1:17:00] righteousness, and obtained promises,
[1:17:02] and stopped the mouths of lions,
[1:17:04] quenched the violence of fire, and
[1:17:07] escaped the edge of the sword. Out of
[1:17:09] the weakness, out of weakness were made
[1:17:11] strong and waxed valiant in fight. In
[1:17:15] fight, turn to turn to flight. the
[1:17:17] armies of the enemies. But now they
[1:17:20] desire a better country, that is an
[1:17:23] heavenly. Wherefore God is not ashamed
[1:17:26] to call them their to be called their
[1:17:29] God, for he hath prepared for them a
[1:17:33] city. That was verse 16. Further up, I I
[1:17:36] I just replaced that. These believers
[1:17:38] These believers all confessing
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; faith
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; in a body cursed to dust.
[1:17:49] They did it, friends.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; And that's not just history.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; That's got to be current events.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what you've been called
[1:18:00] to.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; They did that because they identified.
[1:18:05] Abraham said, "God spoke to me." How do
[1:18:08] we know? What did he say? What language
[1:18:09] did we use? We don't know and we don't
[1:18:11] care.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; We believe God spoke to him. Amen.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Who was there to prove that a voice
[1:18:18] spoke out of a burning bush? Nobody. You
[1:18:20] believe it because you you're made to
[1:18:22] believe it
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; because it ties in with the rest of the
[1:18:25] scripture.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; We believe that Samuel was rejected. We
[1:18:29] believe that David was a friend of God
[1:18:31] and was a king. We believe that Sam that
[1:18:34] that Solomon essentially had almost like
[1:18:37] a a millennium.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; We believe those things.
[1:18:41] We believe that the Rahab was was
[1:18:45] brought forth out of her lineage,
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; really a cursed lineage,
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; but she married into and received the
[1:18:53] seed
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; of Israel
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; and became of the chosen race.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; We believe that.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; We believe that Ba Sheba
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; was forgiven.
[1:19:07] Yes.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "We have to believe those
[1:19:12] things."
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Are you listening to me?
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Bas's
[1:19:18] wife.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; We don't we don't uh we don't perhaps
[1:19:24] say, "Well, that isn't within my scope
[1:19:26] of of belief or understanding." That's
[1:19:29] not for us to say. We don't say this is
[1:19:32] a criteria for everybody to live. That's
[1:19:35] not it. But she had to bring forth. She
[1:19:37] had to bring forth Solomon.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; None of the other wives of David could
[1:19:41] bring him bring that man forth. She had
[1:19:43] to bring him forth. I don't know how.
[1:19:46] All I'm saying is we don't know
[1:19:47] everything about God.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; This God is is way beyond our thoughts.
[1:19:53] This God beyond the trillions and of
[1:19:57] light, space, and mind, beyond any human
[1:20:00] mind. How can you figure that one out?
[1:20:02] We don't know how God I don't know how
[1:20:04] God works in your life and why he
[1:20:07] creates and causes certain things.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; I was perhaps 50 years before I really
[1:20:13] found out why I was standing in front of
[1:20:15] my mom's coffin
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; because I learned that I had to be
[1:20:20] shuffled over here and shuffled over
[1:20:22] there and lived in 13 different places
[1:20:24] in about eight years. Move. This is your
[1:20:27] place now. This is the bed you sleep in.
[1:20:29] Okay, fine. This is the school you go
[1:20:30] to. All right. And I just became kind of
[1:20:33] numb. And then many years later, I find
[1:20:35] myself traveling over many parts of the
[1:20:38] world and India and Africa and Malawi
[1:20:41] and all of these different places. And
[1:20:43] this is your bed. And being told, you
[1:20:45] know, uh wish we had another piece. We
[1:20:48] only have one cloth on these boards. You
[1:20:51] can either sleep under the cloth or on
[1:20:53] top of the cloth. Okay. That's the way
[1:20:55] it was. My only friend, my only
[1:20:57] companion was a lizard that came and
[1:20:59] hung on the wall every night. And know
[1:21:00] we weren't there just one night. I
[1:21:02] wasn't there just for a few hours. We
[1:21:03] were there for days. But we were there
[1:21:06] because of this gospel.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; And we're happy to say we tried to be a
[1:21:11] true witness
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; to the revelation of the son of man to
[1:21:16] be a guardian of this revelation. And
[1:21:19] I'll tell you what, friends, it is
[1:21:21] catching the elect.
[1:21:24] [Applause]
[1:21:26] We could tell you right here in this
[1:21:28] church, in this congregation, right from
[1:21:30] the days of the house and the days of
[1:21:32] the log church and the days how one man
[1:21:35] I walked down a pair of a set of
[1:21:38] stairways that he helped make. Brother
[1:21:41] Amy,
[1:21:44] Brother Amy was a devout Catholic
[1:21:47] and he was an alcoholic and he did
[1:21:50] everything to break that demon of
[1:21:52] alcohol.
[1:21:53] everything that was within him. And he
[1:21:55] told me when he heard of the message
[1:21:57] through his brother over in over on
[1:22:00] Vancouver Island, he said he said he he
[1:22:04] knew enough about the Bible, he even
[1:22:05] went down to Guinea, New Guinea to be on
[1:22:10] a missionary boat, a Catholic missionary
[1:22:12] boat. He thought if I just get isolated,
[1:22:14] if I just get out, I'll somehow break
[1:22:16] this thing, this terrible habit. It's a
[1:22:19] demon. Yes.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; And he came to the knowledge of the
[1:22:23] message and found out that a messenger
[1:22:25] had come and God had sent an Elijah
[1:22:28] ministry.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; And when he saw that the word of God and
[1:22:31] and the Trinity and all of these things
[1:22:34] have been so false, when he received it,
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; he was free.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, he lived 20 years free.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; I took his funeral, but he lived free.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Don't talk to me about it, friends. I
[1:22:49] have tried and proven that this is a
[1:22:51] gospel of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ
[1:22:55] came on the scene and freed him
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; and he went he called his mother and he
[1:23:01] said, "Mother, I'm free."
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; And she said, "Oh, we've heard that
[1:23:04] before. You know, we've heard that." And
[1:23:06] he come to me all sad. He said, "What'll
[1:23:08] I do?" Yeah. She said, she said, "She
[1:23:11] doesn't believe it." I said, "Call her
[1:23:12] in 6 months."
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; So he called her in 6 months. He said,
[1:23:16] "I'm still free."
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; And she says, "Well, you know, I don't
[1:23:20] believe it yet." And he was really sad.
[1:23:22] them. He said, "I waited 6 months. Now
[1:23:24] what I do?" I said, "Wait another 6
[1:23:26] months. Call her in a year." He called
[1:23:28] her in a year. They never became
[1:23:30] believers like he was, but it was a
[1:23:32] reality to him. And he told me, he said,
[1:23:35] "I" he said, with all the knowledge I
[1:23:37] had of of the scriptures. He said, "I
[1:23:40] could have argued this thing so many
[1:23:42] different ways, but he said, I knew one
[1:23:44] thing. I believed that I had faith in
[1:23:46] this God." See, he saw the son.
[1:23:50] He didn't understand everything.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; I was even reading, excuse me for
[1:23:55] bouncing all around, but I was reading
[1:23:56] where they start to bring accusation
[1:23:58] against Jesus Christ at this transition
[1:24:02] which were taking place of his death,
[1:24:03] his burial, and his resurrection. And he
[1:24:06] rose in this transition from son of man
[1:24:10] to son of God.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; And they said they looked for witnesses
[1:24:16] and they couldn't find any. Then they
[1:24:18] found some false witnesses and they
[1:24:20] said, "What do you say?" He said, "I
[1:24:22] will destroy this temple and re up raise
[1:24:26] it up in three days." That's not what he
[1:24:28] said.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; You read it in the scripture. He said,
[1:24:32] "Destroy this temple."
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; He was telling them, "Destroy this
[1:24:37] temple."
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Because he wasn't even talking about the
[1:24:39] temple. He was talking about his body.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Destroy this temple and I'll raise it up
[1:24:44] in three days. And the temple they tried
[1:24:47] to destroy. And the word destroy is even
[1:24:50] different from other places in the
[1:24:51] Bible. He was saying, you know, he was
[1:24:53] saying uh uh free me.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Set me free.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; And that's what he did.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; He was free of the begotten body
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; and took it through death
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; and raised it up. The son of God.
[1:25:12] Hallelujah. He was the son of God before
[1:25:14] it, but he was in a human body for you,
[1:25:17] for me, for those people, but they
[1:25:20] couldn't see it.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; I say, God, give us eyes.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; God, give us spiritual eyes to see the
[1:25:28] hour that we're in. You think I'm just
[1:25:30] excited? I'm not excited. I'm burning up
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; with a living fire.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; God, give it to you, young men.
[1:25:42] see him.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; May your eyes be open, you young ladies,
[1:25:46] that you see him.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; to this congregation, seeing him
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; and all of the little things and trials
[1:25:57] in your job and this and that and the
[1:25:58] other thing. That's meaningless.
[1:26:00] [Music]
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Who hasn't got trials?
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Who hasn't got all kinds of things? You
[1:26:09] got to overcome them.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; The power lays within you.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Not your power, his power.
[1:26:18] [Applause]
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; And so by faith, what what was he doing?
[1:26:25] Because that 11th chapter of Hebrews
[1:26:27] takes it all the way through. All the
[1:26:30] way through. And then what finally
[1:26:32] apostle says, what can we say more?
[1:26:36] time would fail us
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; of all of these people of whom the world
[1:26:40] is not worthy. This world wasn't worthy
[1:26:43] of them. What was God doing? God was
[1:26:46] reaching down
[1:26:48] in the dust of the earth
[1:26:51] and forming a body not of the earth but
[1:26:56] of he for he he brought people out of
[1:26:59] the earth. Abraham was out of the earth.
[1:27:01] Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, all of these.
[1:27:04] Moses, Samuel, David, Solomon, all the
[1:27:07] prophets out of the earth. But there was
[1:27:10] something within them. Their confession
[1:27:14] was greater than even the bodies they
[1:27:16] lived in.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; They believed in the eternal God even
[1:27:21] though they were aging.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; And those of you that are more like
[1:27:27] myself, your hair is turning color and
[1:27:30] maybe losing some of it and whatever
[1:27:31] more, but there is a a eternal seed of
[1:27:35] eternal life. He that believeth on me,
[1:27:38] this son said, shall never die.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Is that what he said?
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; And that's what God meant.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; And so now we have a prophet saying
[1:27:50] this.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every masterpiece
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; is put on a foundation.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Trying to watch my time. I'm sorry.
[1:28:00] Every masterpiece is put on a
[1:28:02] foundation. So God in preparing this
[1:28:05] masterpiece, he put it on a foundation
[1:28:08] of the patriarchs. First Abraham, then
[1:28:11] Isaac, then Jacob, then Joseph, the four
[1:28:15] corners.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; And now the bodywork that came that come
[1:28:20] on this great masterpiece was the
[1:28:23] prophets which was the word.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; They spoke thus saith who?
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Say it again, please.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; They spoke thus sayith the Lord. So now
[1:28:35] God took of the cursed earth and let
[1:28:38] these bodies come and he anointed them
[1:28:40] says you'll be a prophet. You'll speak
[1:28:42] my word. You'll say thus saith the Lord.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; It wasn't that they were infallible. It
[1:28:49] wasn't that they didn't make mistakes.
[1:28:50] It wasn't that they were all understood.
[1:28:53] They were misunderstood
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; and they were not popular.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said when he came, which of
[1:28:59] the prophets haven't you killed?
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; You killed them all. and you're the
[1:29:03] children of them that killed them and
[1:29:05] you garnish and make and they they
[1:29:08] finally shined up the prophets till they
[1:29:09] were acceptable. That's not the kind of
[1:29:12] gospel we want.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; And so the the body part was made by the
[1:29:24] prophets for they spoke the word. He
[1:29:27] said not the law, the prophets. For the
[1:29:30] prophets was the vindicated word of God
[1:29:33] which makes the body,
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; not the patriarchs. The prophets were
[1:29:38] the word. And the greatest of all of
[1:29:41] them was John. The Bible said so. Jesus
[1:29:44] said, "There is not a man ever born of a
[1:29:47] woman as great as John the Baptist, for
[1:29:50] he was the one that that was that could
[1:29:53] introduce the word in its fullness,
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; and the world didn't say, "Oh, how
[1:30:02] wonderful."
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; They beheaded him
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; because a little girl danced.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; And you'd say, "Me join that group?" Not
[1:30:11] a chance.
[1:30:13] He only ministered for a few months and
[1:30:15] he was the one who identified that
[1:30:17] prophet in that young man, that prophet
[1:30:19] in Nazareth. He was the one, look at the
[1:30:21] title, look at the death he had.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; People say and on the internet or
[1:30:27] whatever more say, oh, William Brighton
[1:30:29] was killed in a in a car accident. Yeah.
[1:30:31] By a drunken driver.
[1:30:34] And he had said, and you can go back in
[1:30:36] the message and find that drunken
[1:30:38] driving. He said, "A person that gets
[1:30:40] drunk and they willingly get drunk, they
[1:30:43] willingly get behind an automobile wheel
[1:30:45] and willingly drive down the highway and
[1:30:48] kill somebody." He said, "It's it it's
[1:30:49] as a firstderee murder.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Did he say it?"
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Then how was he killed?
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Then how did he lose his life? Say,
[1:31:01] "Well, why would God allow that?" Tell
[1:31:03] me why God allowed a little girl to
[1:31:05] dance
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; and run to her mother and said, "What
[1:31:10] will I ask? Who want to give be half of
[1:31:11] the kingdom? Ask for John's head."
[1:31:14] John's head
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; to that demon-possessed woman
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; who was living wrong,
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; not with her husband.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; That the head of John the Baptist, I'd
[1:31:26] say I'm proud of it, was worth half the
[1:31:29] kingdom. and furthermore worth more than
[1:31:32] that because that was his conviction
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; and he would not veer away from the word
[1:31:37] of God.
[1:31:39] [Applause]
[1:31:42] [Music]
[1:31:44] I was with brother Brennham.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; And he gave me the account
[1:31:50] when that wealthy, I believe, uh, dairy
[1:31:53] man in California whose wife was healed
[1:31:56] from cancer
[1:31:58] sent him a check.
[1:32:01] It was actually a bank draft or it was a
[1:32:04] letter. And he said a knock came to the
[1:32:07] door and and Sister Brandham, I guess,
[1:32:09] answered. He said, "Is Reverend Brandham
[1:32:10] here?" Yes. And so he came to the door
[1:32:13] and he said, "Uh, are you Reverend
[1:32:15] Brandon?" He said, "Yes, sir." He said,
[1:32:18] "Do you have some evidence or some
[1:32:20] proof? Could you identify yourself?"
[1:32:23] Then he was concerned. He said, "Has
[1:32:25] something happened to my son or
[1:32:26] something?" "No, no." He said,
[1:32:27] "Nothing's happened. We just need to
[1:32:31] assure that we have the correct person."
[1:32:34] And so he showed him, I think, his
[1:32:36] ministry card or something. And then
[1:32:39] they took a letter out and said, "This
[1:32:41] is a letter. Do you know of Mr. So and
[1:32:43] so?" Well, yes. He said, 'I do. I
[1:32:45] believe his wife was healed from cancer.
[1:32:47] He He's from California. Said, "That's
[1:32:49] right. He has sent you $1.5 million.
[1:32:53] That's not only $14.
[1:32:56] That's about 1960s or 1950s dollars.
[1:33:01] That'd be a lot of money today."
[1:33:04] He sent you a million and a half
[1:33:05] dollars. Oh, he said, "I couldn't accept
[1:33:07] that." He said, he said, "I I I could
[1:33:11] not accept." He said, "You don't have to
[1:33:12] accept it. It's already in your account.
[1:33:14] You just have to go and identify
[1:33:16] yourself. It's been sent here to the
[1:33:17] bank, I think, in Louisville." And he
[1:33:20] said, "Well, well, I could." He said, "A
[1:33:21] million half dollars." He said, "That
[1:33:23] drive me crazy. I wouldn't even know
[1:33:25] what to do with it." They said, "Well,
[1:33:27] that that's has nothing to do with us.
[1:33:29] They were actually FBI. They were sent
[1:33:32] with the FBI to identify the right man
[1:33:34] for this money, and he didn't accept it.
[1:33:37] And he said, "Send it back to the man.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Send it back to him because I I cannot
[1:33:43] accept it." And that's what happened.
[1:33:45] How many
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; How many television evangelists would do
[1:33:49] that?
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; How many who have a a I will say a fake
[1:33:54] or phony or a very very cheap substitute
[1:33:57] say, "Oh, somebody's here uh here. You
[1:33:59] got a backachche." Of course you got a
[1:34:01] backachche. I got one.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; We all got back. You have trouble in
[1:34:07] your knee. How many people have trouble
[1:34:08] in their knee? Well, of course, all
[1:34:10] kinds of people have trouble in their
[1:34:11] knee. That's not what this was.
[1:34:14] [Applause]
[1:34:17] This was to prove to this generation
[1:34:19] that Jesus Christ
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; who went to the tomb
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; took the body of this earth
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; through death
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; and brought it back,
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; a changed body,
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; a transformed body and say that we will
[1:34:35] have a glorious body like his body.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Do you want it?
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Do you want it, folks?
[1:34:43] That's what this gospel is all about.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; That's what this message is all about.
[1:34:49] This isn't a hope so.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; This is it shall be so.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; This is my beloved son.
[1:34:57] [Music]
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; And this son also knew to speak.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; He also knew to be silent. And when they
[1:35:11] even misqued him and said,
[1:35:14] he said, "I will destroy this temple and
[1:35:16] I'll raise it up in three days."
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; They asked him, "Dust thou not answer?"
[1:35:22] And he answered him, "Not a word."
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; You can't make a believer out of an
[1:35:28] unbeliever.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, well, just a
[1:35:32] second. Just a second. We all were
[1:35:33] unbelievers." Well, yeah,
[1:35:37] but we were made to believe.
[1:35:42] when the light struck your soul.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; You believed
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; and you might have even said to
[1:35:50] yourself, why am I believing this
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; because truth
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; truth registers
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; in one's heart.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; And then finally came and the greatest
[1:36:04] of all of them was John. And then
[1:36:07] finally came the great head, the head of
[1:36:09] all of it. The rest of the body just
[1:36:12] spoke of it. Abraham spoke of it. Isaac
[1:36:16] spoke of it of a promised son. Joseph,
[1:36:19] the son of prosperity, spoke of it.
[1:36:21] David, the king, spoke of it. They all
[1:36:23] spoke of it. But he was it. Finally, he
[1:36:27] came. Finally, the masterpiece came
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; and the rest of the body spoke of it.
[1:36:36] The foundation was laid by the
[1:36:38] patriarchs, but the body was built by
[1:36:40] the word which was the prophets. And
[1:36:42] here comes the head of it all. Jesus
[1:36:45] came on the scene. We find in him the
[1:36:48] perfect reflection of the word for he
[1:36:52] was the word, the fullness of the word.
[1:36:56] Now again God has a masterpiece
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; again
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; friends the masterpiece he this beloved
[1:37:07] son could not be here in his fullness as
[1:37:10] long as the seals were not open as long
[1:37:13] as there was mysteries still unveiled
[1:37:15] but that's why he had to come and take
[1:37:17] the book and loose the seals and say and
[1:37:21] say here I am
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; here I am.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Love me or hate me, but here I am.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; And that's what he did when he opened up
[1:37:31] the seals and declared those things
[1:37:33] which have been hidden from the
[1:37:35] beginning before the foundation of the
[1:37:37] world. God held it in his mind. And what
[1:37:40] he held in his mind, the prophet in
[1:37:42] Christ the mystery, God revealed. He
[1:37:44] tells what he wanted to do. What God
[1:37:46] wanted to do, he wanted to reveal
[1:37:48] himself. He wanted to reveal himself so
[1:37:51] desperately nothing can stop him. Death
[1:37:54] can't stop him. And the fact is, I'll
[1:37:57] curse the earth, but I'll use that
[1:37:59] earth.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; I'll make that earth confess
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; eternal things,
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; and I'll unfold myself in a body of
[1:38:09] cursed earth, and I'll take it to the
[1:38:12] curse,
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; and I'll raise it up again
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; into the original form
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; that I had in my mind.
[1:38:22] Believest thou this.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Hello. Believest thou this.
[1:38:29] [Applause]
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; That's what this message is all about.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; This message came
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; from heaven.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; He the son came from heaven.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; That's why he said in John 3, even so,
[1:38:47] the son of man who is in heaven standing
[1:38:49] right on the earth. Amen.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet of God stood
[1:38:54] right here. He said, "In another
[1:38:55] dimension. I'm in another world right
[1:38:57] now." Oh, how I thank God for that.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; And I believe it with all my heart,
[1:39:02] friends.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; It touches me very deep. I I I knelt in
[1:39:06] this study today before coming here
[1:39:08] thanking him
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; that I could sense and feel his presence
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; and let him know how I love that
[1:39:16] presence. Amen.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; I don't just say a man telling someone
[1:39:20] some things and getting enthused about
[1:39:22] that. I sense him.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; That's the son,
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; my beloved son.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; And when you love the word of God
[1:39:31] revealed, listen,
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; when you love the word of God revealed,
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; you are loving the son who was the full
[1:39:39] object of the father's love.
[1:39:46] Hello kids. Did you hear that?
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Not just a sermon. I'm just telling you
[1:39:52] some things.
[1:39:56] This whole congregation,
[1:40:00] the whole purpose
[1:40:03] of all of these years is to tell people
[1:40:06] in the day when the son Jesus himself
[1:40:09] the son
[1:40:11] saying when you see these conditions
[1:40:15] again
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; and you confess yourself they are here
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; you girls are in university you young
[1:40:21] men you're in university isn't it Oh,
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; you kids in high school,
[1:40:28] your parents are walking the shops.
[1:40:33] And I can tell you friends, someday,
[1:40:38] someday we may feel a whole lot more
[1:40:41] pressure.
[1:40:44] The whole gay community, I don't call it
[1:40:47] a gay community. To me, there's nothing
[1:40:49] gay about it at all.
[1:40:52] It's unclean.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Absolutely unclean.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; You folks ought to be able to say amen
[1:40:59] to that.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; It's vile and unclean.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Look what they do with the seed.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; The seed.
[1:41:11] The seed is so precious to God.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; He's the giver of life. Look what they
[1:41:16] do with it
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; in utter disdain.
[1:41:20] Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Put a mockery to God.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; But when that time comes,
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; even thus shall it be when the son of
[1:41:28] man, he was the son of man standing on
[1:41:31] the earth. Even thus, he was pointing to
[1:41:33] a forward time. Even thus shall it be
[1:41:35] when the son of man is again revealed.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Just so happened God knew you were going
[1:41:44] to be born at this season.
[1:41:47] God knew you were going to be here
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; and God knew that he would cast a light
[1:41:51] your way. Somebody would bring it your
[1:41:53] way and and and uh would would the light
[1:41:56] would illuminate you within.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; We're done with just being, you know,
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; having a having a soother in the mouth.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; It's time for men and women to stand up
[1:42:14] and
[1:42:15] declare their physician
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; and they come subtle and maybe say, "You
[1:42:22] know what? Uh,
[1:42:27] we'll take away your charity status.
[1:42:31] We will not give receipts anymore
[1:42:34] for tax deductions."
[1:42:36] And they start putting the screws down.
[1:42:43] Then what happens?
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Nothing happens.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing happens.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; We're not here because we get a tax
[1:42:51] receipt.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; We're here because we heard a voice.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; We heard a man. This man.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Have you heard him?
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:43:10] God bless. Can I have a few more
[1:43:12] moments, please?
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; I realize I'm not preaching to a Sunday
[1:43:17] school picnic.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of Elijah was to forrun
[1:43:24] the victorious coming of the righteous
[1:43:26] one.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; It says in Malachi, "And he shall turn
[1:43:29] the heart of the fathers to the
[1:43:31] children, and the heart of the children
[1:43:33] to their fathers, lest I come and smite
[1:43:34] the earth with a curse, or that is
[1:43:36] completely destroy or dedicate for
[1:43:38] destruction. And then in Acts the 7th
[1:43:42] chapter
[1:43:43] uh in that glorious message they I
[1:43:47] believe it's Stephen that is speaking
[1:43:48] which of the prophets have have not your
[1:43:51] fathers persecuted and they have slain
[1:43:54] them which showed before of the coming
[1:43:58] of the just one. Even when they showed
[1:44:00] before of the coming of the just one
[1:44:03] they killed them
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; for speaking of it. Listen friends,
[1:44:08] Jesus, your Lord and Savior, said, "The
[1:44:11] world has hated me
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; and it will hate you."
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Is that what he said?
[1:44:26] expect to, you know, win any accolades
[1:44:29] over this, but nevertheless, I'm going
[1:44:31] to just say what's on my heart if you
[1:44:32] can give me another few minutes. And so,
[1:44:35] forming out of the cursed earth a body
[1:44:36] that God himself would indwell, and
[1:44:39] through him will become the final and
[1:44:42] ultimate sacrifice for sin. Galatians
[1:44:44] 3:13, Christ hath redeemed us from the
[1:44:47] curse of the law, being made a curse for
[1:44:50] us. For it is written, cursed is
[1:44:53] everyone that hangeth on a tree. So when
[1:44:56] this masterpiece was perfected, then he
[1:44:59] had to smite it. He God had to smite it.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; The world argues whether the Jews killed
[1:45:06] him or the Gentiles killed him or the
[1:45:08] Romans killed him. God let him be slain.
[1:45:13] God slew him because that was God in
[1:45:16] Christ
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; taking the body that had been cursed and
[1:45:21] the soul that could not approach God
[1:45:23] without the blood atonement.
[1:45:26] And he says so when this masterpiece was
[1:45:28] perfected in the masterpiece and then he
[1:45:31] had to smite it to take from him another
[1:45:35] piece not another creation but of the
[1:45:39] same creation. Now I'm speaking of your
[1:45:42] beginnings.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; You are a new creation, God. But this is
[1:45:48] where you came from. And if he took from
[1:45:51] him the original creation to make the
[1:45:54] bride for him, he never made another
[1:45:57] creation. When Adam was put to sleep,
[1:45:59] the first Adam and a rib was taken from
[1:46:03] him. It was taken from him. It wasn't
[1:46:06] another creation. It was part of that
[1:46:08] original creation.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; And now he who was on the cross hanging
[1:46:14] for us, he was hanging there because he
[1:46:17] was the word
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; because he was the word of God
[1:46:21] expressed.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; And that's why they hated him because he
[1:46:25] was the word.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; And here we have now a messenger in this
[1:46:29] day said, "It isn't me that they hate,
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; it's the message."
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; They didn't want to hear that.
[1:46:37] This is just one God. Here you Israel,
[1:46:40] your God is one God. He's in three three
[1:46:42] offices. He's in the fatherhood. He's in
[1:46:45] the sunship. And he is this Holy Spirit.
[1:46:48] He's a spirit.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit. The Bible say, does it
[1:46:52] say it?
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; It's so simple, friends. And people,
[1:46:55] they just, you know, they stumble over
[1:46:57] it willingly.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; I've said to trinitarians, "How many are
[1:47:02] you going to see when you get there?"
[1:47:04] Well, they said, "One." I said, 'Excuse
[1:47:06] me,
[1:47:08] you have three persons down here and
[1:47:10] you're going to see one. How does that
[1:47:11] work?
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; The man that led me into the ministry,
[1:47:15] he said, 'Well, I I could only see two.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; So, I was a young minister and I met I
[1:47:22] met the prophet of God. I'd been
[1:47:24] baptized in the name of Father, Son, and
[1:47:25] Holy Ghost. That's what the Bible said.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; That's the way I was baptized.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; And uh God had, don't ask me, I don't
[1:47:32] know, three, yeah, we believe in the
[1:47:34] Trinity. Uh, how many are there? Well, I
[1:47:37] don't know. I think that there's just
[1:47:38] one, but anyway, because I read the
[1:47:40] scripture here, oh, Israel, your God is
[1:47:42] one, right?
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; So, I thought, well, you know, but but
[1:47:45] here's Jesus on earth and all of these
[1:47:46] things that everybody. So, then I sat
[1:47:48] sat with the prophet of God and asked
[1:47:51] him, you know, I didn't even ask him.
[1:47:53] And he just said, it's the same God in
[1:47:55] three offices. Wow.
[1:47:57] You're just all over. Of course.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Of course.
[1:48:03] Who who who can imagine who can plum the
[1:48:06] depths of almighty God? So God and and
[1:48:09] the prophet said in Christ is the
[1:48:11] mystery of God revealed. He said the
[1:48:13] first thing was God wanted listen this
[1:48:16] very closely now absorb it please. Yes.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; The first thing that God wanted to
[1:48:23] reveal himself to the people. That's the
[1:48:27] first thing. God, this great being.
[1:48:34] This one that's indescribable
[1:48:37] beyond all of our thoughts or words or
[1:48:40] what are we? We're pieces of dust on a
[1:48:42] little piece of earth. An orb out here.
[1:48:45] I don't even know how God could locate
[1:48:47] it in the universe.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; But this was his womb
[1:48:53] for life.
[1:48:55] It was a profusion of seeds. That's
[1:48:58] where he'd focus the full focus of his
[1:49:01] word. Let there be.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; And there was. Let there be light. Let
[1:49:07] there be waters. Let the waters bring
[1:49:09] forth. Let the earth bring forth. Let
[1:49:12] the dry land appear. Maybe it took
[1:49:14] trillions of years. I don't know. I
[1:49:16] couldn't care less. But it happened.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; And here we come. Individuals that have
[1:49:23] something within us that cry out
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; for this eternal being.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; And we're here because God
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; that you call your God wanted to make
[1:49:32] himself known and reveal himself.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; And listen how perfect this is. And he
[1:49:39] couldn't do it as the great Jehovah.
[1:49:42] God who covered all space,
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; time, and eternity. He could not. He's
[1:49:49] too great to ever be revealed to people
[1:49:52] because it would be too mysterious. I'm
[1:49:55] going to close in a moment. How could
[1:49:57] he, that great being that never did
[1:50:00] begin?
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; You don't understand that. I don't
[1:50:04] understand that.
[1:50:09] that after you went out beyond the cycle
[1:50:11] of hundreds and billions and trillions.
[1:50:13] You might say, "Well, I've heard it read
[1:50:14] before." Well, I'm reading it to you
[1:50:16] again.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:50:22] all your mathematics and your calculus
[1:50:24] and all of your
[1:50:27] brother Jean is studying
[1:50:29] artificial intelligence.
[1:50:32] That's way up here someplace.
[1:50:35] artificial intelligence at SFU.
[1:50:38] I tell you what, this isn't artificial
[1:50:41] intelligence.
[1:50:43] This is the original intelligence.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; And after you went out,
[1:50:52] trillions and trillions of years of
[1:50:55] light space. And here you have a man
[1:50:57] with a a man that vessel with a seventh
[1:50:59] grade education using a scientific term.
[1:51:02] You hear it all the time. years of light
[1:51:05] space.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; When I first read it, I said, "That's a
[1:51:11] scientific terminology."
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Where'd he get that?
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Not in Kentucky.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; From a divine source.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Tell them who I am.
[1:51:27] Now he's asking a a cultured and
[1:51:30] educated
[1:51:32] way up here that I made education of
[1:51:34] God. Now they're asking you explain
[1:51:36] that.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; And he said he couldn't.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; It couldn't be explained.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; But he gives the answer. Amen.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; And after you went beyond the cycle of
[1:51:47] hundreds of billions and trillions and
[1:51:49] trillions of years of light space and on
[1:51:52] out into the infinite into the eternity
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; and a great creature that was all of
[1:51:58] that and still is
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; he says but what he wanted to do
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; listen now you'll never grasp this
[1:52:08] without someone that a prophet messenger
[1:52:12] that could actually reach into the mind
[1:52:14] of God. Don't tell me how. Don't ask me
[1:52:17] how. I do not know.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; I cannot even I can't even know. My wife
[1:52:24] is sitting back there. Her dad is had a
[1:52:27] massive heart attack.
[1:52:30] Hung between life and death for five
[1:52:32] weeks in an oxygen tent.
[1:52:35] We had William Brandham up to Port El
[1:52:38] Bernie and then Victoria and then he's
[1:52:41] just leaving and I'm outside his motel
[1:52:45] and his wife and children are in the
[1:52:47] motel and it's the last it was just deep
[1:52:49] dusk and I was saying brother Brandon
[1:52:51] may you have a nice journey and God be
[1:52:55] with you and something we're just having
[1:52:56] our little final things. My wife had
[1:52:59] wanted to talk to him and ask him about
[1:53:01] her daddy.
[1:53:04] Had not been a professed Christian as
[1:53:07] such, but was a very, very good man.
[1:53:11] They want him to be mayor of the city
[1:53:13] they lived in. So that was his stature
[1:53:17] in amongst the people, but he didn't
[1:53:20] know Jesus Christ as a savior. And there
[1:53:22] he's laying hanging between life and
[1:53:24] death.
[1:53:28] And while we're having these words,
[1:53:30] Brother Bram just goes like this to my
[1:53:32] wife. By the way, Sister Biscll, your
[1:53:35] father will be all right.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, that was just a nice word."
[1:53:41] He didn't know anything about it.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Hadn't got to talk to him yet. What does
[1:53:46] all right mean? All right means that
[1:53:48] you're born again.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; You can't be all right and not be born
[1:53:52] again.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; And he received Jesus Christ after this.
[1:53:56] [Music]
[1:54:01] He said he couldn't do it. He said, but
[1:54:02] what he wanted to do, what he wanted to
[1:54:05] do, please let this sink very deep. He
[1:54:10] loved
[1:54:11] fatherhood.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Here's this great indescribable being
[1:54:16] full of attributes.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; He's God. Yeah,
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; he created all of these things,
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; millions of species on the earth. He
[1:54:26] created all of this. But that wasn't
[1:54:28] what is. He didn't say, "Well, look at
[1:54:30] the dinosaurs. Look at these giant
[1:54:32] creatures. Look at all the sea and
[1:54:34] everything that's in." That wasn't it.
[1:54:36] He loved fatherhood.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; I want to have a family.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; He craved
[1:54:45] to have fellowship.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me?
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; This God
[1:54:56] picks us drags
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; of the earth.
[1:55:02] I'm going to make you worthy.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; I'm going to come myself. I'm going to
[1:55:07] love you
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; into my kingdom.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; And you will love me.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; You because you see what I did for you
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; and there's no sin. Who can separate us
[1:55:19] from the love of God?
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; No height, no depth, no trouble,
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; no money problems, no economic problems,
[1:55:29] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:55:31] God.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; If something could separate us, who is
[1:55:36] God?
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Not this God.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; And he loves fatherhood.
[1:55:48] And he said, "For he was a father."
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; And I I'd like you if you could repeat
[1:55:54] it. The only way
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; say the only way
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; that he could express it was to become a
[1:56:04] son of man.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; It's the only way.
[1:56:14] There's no other way.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; And thus when he came in a body of
[1:56:20] earth, taken out of the earth that God
[1:56:23] himself had cursed,
[1:56:26] he saw him coming up out of the water,
[1:56:29] having heard
[1:56:31] his Elijah prophet
[1:56:34] and being baptized of him. When he comes
[1:56:36] up out of the water, no wonder a voice
[1:56:39] spoke out of the heavens. This is my
[1:56:42] beloved son.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; God couldn't hold it back anymore. He
[1:56:47] loved fatherhood. I've got a son.
[1:57:01] I've got a son
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; and this son is going to pay the
[1:57:06] penalty.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; He's going to obedient be obedient to
[1:57:11] every word of God.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; And that is why even when his friends
[1:57:15] and his disciples couldn't understand it
[1:57:18] and said, "You'll never go to death.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; I'll go with you." Peter said,
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Get behind me, Satan.
[1:57:30] You don't perceive. You don't understand
[1:57:31] the things. He never cursed him. He
[1:57:34] never damned him. He didn't. And Peter
[1:57:37] didn't betray him. He denied him, but he
[1:57:40] didn't betray him. Judas betrayed him.
[1:57:43] Right at this great transition time,
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; and I haven't got time to get into it,
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; but all of this rubbish and stuff that
[1:57:51] goes around and says, "Well, he said
[1:57:53] this and he said that." And God knows
[1:57:55] what he said. And God, who knows what he
[1:57:58] said, stood right with him on the
[1:58:01] platform, night after night to the very
[1:58:04] end.
[1:58:05] [Music]
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Pentecost, old, he went off at the end.
[1:58:13] Oh, did he? He spent the last 30 days of
[1:58:15] his life, almost every service, speaking
[1:58:17] for them.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; So I cast right back them. Oh, you had
[1:58:22] someone who went off teaching and
[1:58:24] preaching to you? No. Don't be
[1:58:27] hypocritical now. You loved that. What
[1:58:29] you call a gift wasn't a gift. It was a
[1:58:32] prophetic ministry.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; And they've never had it since
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; and the world will never see it again.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; He said the very next thing is the
[1:58:41] resurrection and the rapture. And that's
[1:58:44] why this message came. That's why this
[1:58:46] Lord Jesus revealed himself. I am he
[1:58:50] that was. I am he that is. And I am he
[1:58:54] that will be. There's no other son that
[1:58:56] can say I'm the first and I'm the last.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; I'm the beginning and I'm the end.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; That's this son of God.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; That's this son of man.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; This son of God. And he will show
[1:59:16] himself to the Jews as son of David.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:26] Hallelujah.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; And I'm closing with this simple phrase.
[1:59:37] God has made you Cloverdale. By the way,
[1:59:41] I don't care what the name is.
[1:59:44] I don't care what term, what name you
[1:59:46] give yourself as a group.
[1:59:50] You either have this revelation or don't
[1:59:52] have it.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; And those that God has revealed himself
[1:59:57] to,
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; only he can give it.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; He that reveals himself
[2:00:05] has made you a witness and a guardian
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; of the revelation
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; of the son of man. Amen.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; You that are having the meetings at SFU,
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; that's what you're testifying.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; You that have had an experience with
[2:00:22] God,
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; perhaps you that have been to camp, you
[2:00:26] that have been baptized in this tank,
[2:00:28] that's what this is all about.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; That's what this is all about.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; We're not here to hanker or quibble
[2:00:34] about is it this way, is it that way?
[2:00:36] God has said which way it is,
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; and God is honoring what he honors.
[2:00:43] I understand that two more want to be
[2:00:45] baptized this evening.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my my
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; I wonder brother Nathan if you could
[2:00:52] come please. I had written down my hope
[2:00:55] is in the Lord
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; and from this time on
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; I wonder if you can sing it with me in a
[2:01:04] new way in a living way. This is my this
[2:01:08] isn't only my hope. This is my faith.
[2:01:10] I'm here at this end.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; God knew I would live in this age, in
[2:01:14] this generation, this time.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; We're not here to preach politics,
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; but I I come from the Ukraine or my
[2:01:23] greatgrandparents came from the Ukraine
[2:01:25] and my grandpa came from the Ukraine.
[2:01:28] Came from where the hetic Jews sect that
[2:01:31] have the curls. There was a it's a
[2:01:35] Horidena
[2:01:37] and it's a small village but I
[2:01:39] understand
[2:01:40] it became very well known that Jews have
[2:01:43] about 500 years of history in the
[2:01:46] Ukraine.
[2:01:48] Russia has just amassed a 100,000 troops
[2:01:54] and they talk about Crimea.
[2:01:56] There is no trouble in Crimea.
[2:01:59] And I'm not here to discuss politics.
[2:02:01] I'm simply to say you and I don't know.
[2:02:04] We could be in a we could be in a war
[2:02:06] tomorrow morning.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; We don't know how it's going to happen.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Don't start calling then.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Say, "I give my life now.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; I'm giving myself now." You may be a
[2:02:21] believer. You may be a Christian, but
[2:02:23] you need to take a whole new grasp of
[2:02:24] it. Say, "I didn't realize some of these
[2:02:27] things. God, do what you would with me.
[2:02:30] I'm the clay. You're the potter. Do what
[2:02:32] you would like to do.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Let's not let's not just treat it as
[2:02:44] another Sunday
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Vernon Manahan
[2:02:53] uh from the Philippines is just ending
[2:02:54] his trip. He'd be arriving in Seattle
[2:02:57] tomorrow night, Monday night, and then
[2:03:00] they're just having a little bit of a
[2:03:02] gathering. Lord willing, I would like to
[2:03:04] go down. Uh, I'd like you to remember
[2:03:07] him and the other brethren, Brother
[2:03:09] Nester, Brother Delmundo, and there's
[2:03:12] other pastors. I'm happy for those
[2:03:14] people. I don't know, maybe you weren't
[2:03:16] here when he said it, but I called as
[2:03:20] soon as I heard about the super typhoon
[2:03:22] and the terrible thing. I didn't know if
[2:03:24] believers had lost their homes or lost
[2:03:27] lives or whatever more. I called I I
[2:03:30] sent an email immediately to Pastor
[2:03:33] Nester and I said, "Tomorrow morning
[2:03:35] when our office opens, we will send
[2:03:37] immediately $10,000." I didn't know
[2:03:40] whether we had it or what, but I knew
[2:03:42] that it would happen. And so we sent
[2:03:45] that and they said we were some of the
[2:03:47] first to respond. Three pastors took
[2:03:50] their position to take responsibility
[2:03:53] for the area. They divided the whole
[2:03:55] devastated area into three areas. I'm
[2:03:58] just telling this very quickly to you to
[2:03:59] let you know that I said when when we
[2:04:02] give on behalf of the people. I said we
[2:04:05] want to have a high high degree of
[2:04:08] accountability. Not just that you
[2:04:10] receive the funds and not just that you
[2:04:11] give the funds to needy people, but that
[2:04:15] you see that those funds do for those
[2:04:18] people what they need. If they need a
[2:04:20] house that it's built, if they need
[2:04:23] income and especially food and water and
[2:04:25] clothing right now, they lost
[2:04:27] everything. Lost absolutely everything.
[2:04:30] And in the short time since that
[2:04:32] typhoon, these three brothers and the
[2:04:35] giving of believers all over the country
[2:04:38] have built over 200
[2:04:40] homes. These are small, they're simple.
[2:04:43] They're just maybe two rooms, but at
[2:04:45] least they're not under a piece of tin.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; And they're not on the ground with
[2:04:51] thousands of snakes,
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; which a lot of them were troubled with
[2:04:55] because the snakes flood waters came.
[2:04:58] And with the typhoon, the water came and
[2:05:00] swept it all in. Dead bodies were still
[2:05:03] when Brother Vernon was here a few days
[2:05:05] ago, said there's still people.
[2:05:09] They haven't uncovered everyone. We're
[2:05:11] sitting here. you're going to go to a
[2:05:12] nice room and maybe a nice home or go
[2:05:15] for something to eat. But brother
[2:05:17] Vernon, don't forget he's going back to
[2:05:20] the situation. They built six churches
[2:05:23] and over 200 homes. And they build a
[2:05:26] they can build a home there for, you
[2:05:28] know, maybe 1,500, a couple thousand
[2:05:30] dollars or less. And the and the
[2:05:32] believers gave and unbelievers and even
[2:05:35] officials said, "What kind of
[2:05:38] organization do you have?" said, 'We
[2:05:41] don't have any.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; We don't have an organization. Well, how
[2:05:45] did you get I mean, we've got all of
[2:05:47] the, you know, the jurisdiction of the
[2:05:49] various government agencies and large
[2:05:52] agencies and everything else said, "No,
[2:05:54] this came right away." People sent right
[2:05:57] away and they got building materials and
[2:06:00] they started to build. I just say, well,
[2:06:02] I thank God for that and thank the
[2:06:04] people for that. Thank everyone for
[2:06:07] their, you know, that's that's one of
[2:06:09] the material things. But there's a day
[2:06:11] coming
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; when there'll be no more typhoons
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; and there'll be no more death.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; And there'll be no more sorrow.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; And there'll be no more tears.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; You might have had tears this last week.
[2:06:26] I tell you, in the name of the Lord
[2:06:28] Jesus Christ, through this beloved son,
[2:06:31] there will be no more tears.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; There'll be no more pain.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Behold, he said, I make all things new.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to his name. Why don't we
[2:06:45] stand? Say, my hope is in him.
[2:06:50] I trust that you were able to grasp,
[2:06:53] hang on to some of these things today.
[2:06:54] Will you do that?
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; And tonight are having two more baptisms
[2:06:58] tonight. Brother Tom Ray will be
[2:07:00] ministering and uh we have another baby
[2:07:04] dedication this evening and we're happy
[2:07:06] about that. All right, let us just sing
[2:07:09] this song together in closing.
[2:07:13] [Music]
[2:07:15] My heart
[2:07:18] is in the
[2:07:28] Oh,
[2:07:31] my home
[2:07:34] is in the Lord
[2:07:38] forever.
[2:07:41] [Music]
[2:07:45] I stand in all within the presence of
[2:07:50] the Lord
[2:07:53] in the ways of all the aesthe
[2:08:00] [Music]
[2:08:02] [Applause]
[2:08:04] Jesus
[2:08:09] the living.
[2:08:10] [Music]
[2:08:12] The only source
[2:08:15] of life.
[2:08:17] My
[2:08:20] is in the Lord.
[2:08:24] It's my home
[2:08:28] and
[2:08:31] oh my home
[2:08:35] is in the Lord

[2:08:50] rising sun.
[2:08:54] To meet the sinner in his brokenness,

[2:09:05] [Applause]

[2:09:14] their heart
[2:09:16] and
[2:09:18] your confession now in the Lord. Oh

[2:09:52] a prayer with this congregation?

[2:10:35] my

[2:10:57] forever.
[2:11:03] Amen.
[2:11:05] Praise the Lord.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I don't even know what to
[2:11:08] say, Lord. I'm just so thankful that
[2:11:10] it's about you, Lord Jesus. It's you,
[2:11:12] Lord, that's arrested our lives, Lord,
[2:11:14] that's come and grabbed a hold of our
[2:11:16] soul, Lord Jesus. The the bridegroom
[2:11:18] call came through the message, Lord
[2:11:20] Jesus. And how we're so thankful for
[2:11:22] that, Lord. We're thankful to be here,
[2:11:24] Lord, to be able to hear the word this
[2:11:25] morning. We want to thank you for that,
[2:11:27] Lord. May you bless Brother Ed. May you
[2:11:29] strengthen him, Lord Jesus, and just
[2:11:30] continue to move in our midst, Lord.
[2:11:33] It's not just about being in church,
[2:11:34] Lord. It's about you just moving and
[2:11:36] having your way upon different lives,
[2:11:38] different brothers and sisters, Lord
[2:11:39] Jesus. So, would you help us as we go
[2:11:41] for lunch, Lord? Be with us in our
[2:11:42] conversation. And Lord, would you help
[2:11:44] our minds and our spirits be refreshed
[2:11:46] so we can come again and hear the word
[2:11:48] this evening, Lord? Bless Tom as he
[2:11:50] prepares, Lord. And Father, I just I
[2:11:52] just pray you be with the children,
[2:11:53] Lord. how we love what you're doing
[2:11:55] amongst the young people, Lord. And
[2:11:56] there's we how we we're so happy to see
[2:11:58] with Dominic, Lord, and his second son,
[2:12:00] Lord. Bless them, we pray, Lord. Bless
[2:12:02] all the young kids, Lord. Protect them,
[2:12:03] Lord, from this wicked age, Lord Jesus.
[2:12:06] Oh, God. May your hand be upon them so
[2:12:08] strong, Lord. Be with the children,
[2:12:10] Lord. How we just so love them, Father.
[2:12:12] And be with the older ones, too, Lord.
[2:12:14] We don't want to leave anybody out. We
[2:12:15] just love you. Pray you have your way
[2:12:17] this day, Lord. We give it to you in
[2:12:19] Jesus name. Amen.
[2:12:22] [Music]
[2:12:24] Thank you, brother Kyle. And listen,
[2:12:26] there's one more important notice
[2:12:28] tonight. We're also going to have a a
[2:12:31] short video clip to that will give you
[2:12:36] the uh give you the instructions, not so
[2:12:39] much instruction, but show you how you
[2:12:42] can link up. And over the last few
[2:12:45] weeks,
[2:12:46] uh, the brothers of Brother Michael Ray,
[2:12:49] Brother Tom have been working very, very
[2:12:52] hard, uh, to get the testimonies
[2:12:56] of some of the people that you perhaps
[2:12:58] have met, maybe you haven't even met,
[2:13:01] uh, the students from SFU,
[2:13:04] uh, different families that have been
[2:13:07] deeply deeply affected within the
[2:13:08] congregation, the Florent family,
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; uh, the Adamora family,
[2:13:13] how we thank God
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; for the sovereign work of God.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; This young man right here, Jonathan
[2:13:23] Walder,
[2:13:25] over a year ago, August, God be to speak
[2:13:29] to him. I didn't know it. And he was
[2:13:32] sitting right here in the second seat
[2:13:33] and then on the first seat and and
[2:13:36] others gave testimony the same thing. I
[2:13:38] just thought saw the glory of God on it.
[2:13:40] I didn't know who he was cuz I hadn't
[2:13:42] seen him for about 4 years and God just
[2:13:45] laid his hand on him out in the world
[2:13:47] and brought them right in the kingdom of
[2:13:49] God. So we have the testimonies of these
[2:13:52] people. I haven't even heard them. I
[2:13:54] don't know know how that all happened.
[2:13:56] It was happening too fast. And how do
[2:13:58] you have like there's about 37 been
[2:14:00] baptized in the last 13 months. Now two
[2:14:03] more tonight to be 39. Do you realize
[2:14:06] that's the size of some little bodies of
[2:14:08] people? 39 people in in in a in 13
[2:14:12] months. I just say this is of God.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I'm also willing to say
[2:14:19] the wind can blow and pass and you may
[2:14:21] not see it for another 13 months.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; But I say to you that have experienced
[2:14:28] it, God gave it to you for one purpose,
[2:14:31] to be a true witness
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; of the revelation that God made it to
[2:14:36] you. Brother Steven, God called you
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; sovereignly
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; and gave you such a clear revelation
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; without any without any prompting.
[2:14:46] Harley, you just begin to see things.
[2:14:48] And many can say the same thing. I say,
[2:14:50] "God bless you as you're dismissed. And
[2:14:52] if you'd come a little bit early
[2:14:53] tonight, please come a little bit early.
[2:14:55] Maybe we'll start the song service a few
[2:14:57] minutes, maybe 10, 15 minutes early, so
[2:14:59] we have time for all of these things."
[2:15:02] All right. God bless you. Greet one
[2:15:04] another with a good handshake. Amen.
