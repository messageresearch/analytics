[7:56] one of you on this resurrection morning.
[7:58] Say, "God bless you. Welcome to the
[8:00] house of the Lord this morning in
[8:02] anticipation of a wonderful day."
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've we've come. We've gathered.
[8:08] We were praying in this study just a few
[8:10] moments ago and had a picture of
[8:12] shepherds
[8:14] laying down their staffs,
[8:16] gathering their little flocks of sheep,
[8:18] and the shepherd spoke to them. I say,
[8:20] "Oh, great shepherd this morning, come
[8:23] and speak to us this morning, Lord."
[8:25] Let's sing together. Oh, come all ye
[8:27] faithful. Number 788 on the screen.
[8:30] Quite a few things happening this
[8:32] morning. We have a baby dedication. All
[8:34] the children are going to come and sing
[8:36] for us this morning. So, just want to
[8:38] relax in his presence this morning.

[8:48] joyful and triumphant.

[9:40] Oh, sing all ye sit in heaven
[9:46] above.

[9:58] Oh come let us adore him. Oh come let us

[10:24] For he alone is worthy.
[10:29] For he alone is worthy.
[10:34] Oh Christ
[10:39] the Lord. Let's sing that out verse
[10:40] again. For he alone is worthy.
[10:46] Yes, you alone is worthy.
[10:51] For he alone is worthy.
[10:59] Christ
[11:02] the Lord. As we stand this morning,
[11:05] we'll give him all the glory.
[11:12] We'll give you all the glory.
[11:16] We'll give him all the glory.
[11:26] The Lord

[12:42] him. Oh come let us

[12:52] Christ
[12:56] the Lord.
[12:59] Hallelujah.
[13:01] Hallelujah.
[13:04] Hallelujah.
[13:06] take an opportunity to pray over several
[13:08] prayer requests. Ask Brother Darren
[13:10] Hoffman if you'd come this morning and
[13:12] take the needs before the Lord. We're
[13:14] also going to have the deacons come and
[13:16] receive the morning tithes and offerings
[13:17] if the deacons would come as you give
[13:20] unto the Lord this morning. I believe
[13:22] brother Darren has a comment or two to
[13:23] say uh just before the end of the year
[13:26] as a trustee regarding tithes and
[13:27] offerings. But I do want to mention
[13:29] these requests before the congregation
[13:31] this morning. Brother Jean Commandanda,
[13:35] he says, "My brother's son Eric, he was
[13:38] taken to the hospital this morning in
[13:40] central Africa. We do not know the
[13:42] problem at this time, but please pray
[13:44] for a complete healing."
[13:46] Brother Ben Charman, please pray for
[13:48] Tina Rutder. She overdosed and is in the
[13:53] hospital and they haven't been able to
[13:55] get her to wake up at this time. Brother
[13:57] Norm Wood requests that we pray for
[14:00] brother Sam Waldner. Many of you may
[14:02] know this already. Uh he was admitted to
[14:05] the hospital last night and was
[14:07] diagnosed with a mild heart attack. So
[14:08] we want to remember brother Sam this
[14:10] morning. We have a testimony from Sister
[14:13] Eleanor Drake regarding William Drake.
[14:15] He wants to thank all who prayed for
[14:17] him. He is thankful that he did not lose
[14:20] his legs or that the truck he was in
[14:23] didn't go over into the water from the
[14:26] bridge that he was on. He had surgery on
[14:28] his legs and came home yesterday from
[14:30] the hospital in a wheelchair. He has a
[14:32] long recovery period ahead. Please keep
[14:36] him in prayer for a complete healing and
[14:38] that he will commit his heart and his
[14:40] life to Jesus Christ. Amen.
[14:44] Now, Brother Darren, why don't you come
[14:45] this morning?
[14:53] Let's just bow our heads.
[14:57] Heavenly Father, where you are gathered
[14:58] here this morning, Lord Jesus,
[15:01] to remember the one that came,
[15:04] the one that took on human flesh
[15:07] that could fulfill the law, dear Lord
[15:09] Jesus. And by your death, by the
[15:11] shedding of the blood, you remitted our
[15:14] sins, Lord God. That blood was shed on
[15:17] Calvary, dear God, that each one of us
[15:18] could be free. free and delivered from
[15:21] every affliction, Lord, every disease,
[15:24] every trial, dear God. Lord Jesus, you
[15:27] purchased it all when you said, "It is
[15:29] finished, Father." So, Lord Jesus, we're
[15:32] claiming the promises this morning,
[15:33] Father. It's already done. It's already
[15:36] finished, Lord Jesus. Father, ones that
[15:38] need healing in our body, dear God.
[15:40] Lord, ones that need uh deliverance,
[15:42] dear God, from demons, Father. How we
[15:45] put our hands upon these prayer
[15:47] requests, Lord Jesus. Each need you know
[15:48] of, dear God. You know how just to deal
[15:51] with each situation, Father. So, we're
[15:53] commending each one to you, Lord God.
[15:54] That you'd strengthen those that are
[15:56] weak. That you deliver those that are
[15:58] bound, dear God. Lord Jesus, you'd speak
[16:00] to the hearts, Lord Jesus. Open the eyes
[16:02] of the blind. Heavenly Father, for we
[16:05] are a needy people, Lord Jesus. Lord
[16:07] God, we so thank you that we serve a a
[16:10] true and risen savior. The God that
[16:12] hears and answers our prayers, Lord. So
[16:15] we commit ourselves into your hands,
[16:17] Lord God, that your will would be done.
[16:19] That you would do the miracles, Lord.
[16:21] You would do the great things, Lord
[16:22] Jesus, in our lives. That we could just
[16:24] stand still and see the glory of God in
[16:26] our midst. Lord Jesus, we want to
[16:29] remember, Lord, the service this
[16:30] morning, dear God, that you'd speak to
[16:32] our hearts, Lord, and we would just
[16:34] enter in, Father. we would just receive
[16:37] all that you have for us that we would
[16:39] recognize our position in Christ, Lord,
[16:41] and walk in these promises. We just so
[16:44] thank you, Lord. Just ask your blessings
[16:46] upon each one, those on the internet,
[16:48] Lord. Those with hands raised, hearts
[16:50] raised to you, Lord Jesus. You see the
[16:52] need. You see the desire, dear God.
[16:55] Lord, you hear the groaning within our
[16:57] hearts, Lord. We so thank you for that,
[17:00] Lord. When we fail to have words to
[17:02] utter, you know our hearts, Lord, and we
[17:04] so love you. you're so mindful of us,
[17:07] Lord. Oh, that you're so attentive to
[17:09] our prayers. Be with us now, Father.
[17:11] Lord Jesus, also just asking that you
[17:13] would just um bless the people now,
[17:16] Lord, in the name of our Lord and Savior
[17:18] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[17:21] Uh so, just before we take up the
[17:25] offering, I figured I'd make the
[17:26] announcements first because one time
[17:28] when I did it, made an announcement,
[17:29] everybody was busy. Nobody really heard
[17:31] what I had to say. So this time we'll
[17:33] just if the brothers can just hold on
[17:35] there for a minute. Um it's the end of
[17:37] the year again. Uh just about another
[17:39] week and we'll be into a new year 2013.
[17:44] So regarding your your tithes and your
[17:45] offerings uh just have a few points for
[17:48] just remind everyone. We just want to
[17:50] make sure that everyone's aware of these
[17:52] things. Uh first of all, if you want uh
[17:56] your donations to be part of your 2012
[18:00] donation receipt, we have to receive
[18:03] your donations, whether it's ti or your
[18:05] offerings, uh no later than December
[18:08] 31st, which is watch night. If you're if
[18:11] you're making it out by check, make sure
[18:14] it's dated no later than December 31st.
[18:17] Otherwise, we can't give it to you for
[18:19] we can't apply that to this year's
[18:21] donation receipt. Um,
[18:24] also, so for your donations,
[18:28] uh, for the Americans, you probably want
[18:29] a US donation receipt. So, your donation
[18:31] should be made payable to Bible
[18:33] believers of Washington.
[18:36] And if you're a Canadian, you probably
[18:37] want a Canadian donation receipt. So,
[18:39] make your checks payable to Cloverdale
[18:42] Bible Way.
[18:43] Now, um if if anybody forgets, um ask me
[18:48] or ask one of the deac or trustees or a
[18:51] lot of people probably already know
[18:52] those things. Um the other thing is we
[18:55] just want to make it make it clear about
[18:57] uh the offerings that we take up in the
[18:59] morning. These offerings aren't to
[19:01] replace what we've already established
[19:03] in the past with our with our tithe box
[19:06] in the uh foyer or many of us will pay
[19:09] by credit card or by debit card at the
[19:11] office during the day. uh this is not to
[19:13] replace that. This is just to give
[19:15] opportunity for those who aren't
[19:17] accustomed maybe to to giving an
[19:19] offering to the Lord. Um or if you just,
[19:22] you know, you just didn't have time to
[19:23] get into the office or the tithe box.
[19:25] So, we just want to make this uh an
[19:27] opportunity for you to give of your
[19:29] offerings. This is not your tithes. This
[19:32] is your offerings. I mean, you can put
[19:33] your tithe envelope, if you have a tithe
[19:35] envelope, put it in there if you'd like,
[19:36] but this is we're collecting ties, which
[19:39] is going to um help to pay for the
[19:41] building and all the associated costs.
[19:43] Um, so I think I've covered everything.
[19:52] And we do have envelopes in the back
[19:54] there on the on the tithing box. So, if
[19:56] you want to put your cash in the
[19:58] envelope so we know who it is so that we
[19:59] can then attribute that to your donation
[20:01] receipt, then by all means do that or
[20:03] just drop your cash, whatever you want,
[20:05] into the offering um bucket, whichever
[20:08] way you want to do it. So, I just want
[20:10] to make it so that it's easy for
[20:12] everyone to give. So, uh let's just bow
[20:14] our heads now for the the offering.
[20:19] Heavenly Father, we want to thank you,
[20:21] Lord Jesus, for this place. Father, you
[20:24] said as you see the day approaching to
[20:25] gather yourself so much more together.
[20:28] And Lord Jesus, you've been faithful to
[20:29] us and you've provided a place for us to
[20:31] gather that we could be under the
[20:33] sounding of the gospel. So Lord Jesus,
[20:36] we just want to be able to give back a
[20:37] little bit, Lord, what you've so poured
[20:38] into our lives, Lord Jesus, to support,
[20:42] Lord God, this this uh the church, Lord
[20:45] Jesus, all that it does. Father, we just
[20:47] ask that you bless the people, Lord, as
[20:48] they would give. We know that it's a
[20:51] it's a difficult time, Lord. many many
[20:53] ones in financial distress, Lord. But
[20:56] Father, even the woman that gave two
[20:57] months, Lord, she you said she gave more
[20:59] than all the rest because she gave of
[21:01] her of her whole living, Lord, we may
[21:04] not be able to give much, Lord, but you
[21:05] see what we do give. And Lord Jesus,
[21:08] you'll bless those that give. Give from
[21:10] their hearts, Lord. Give willingly,
[21:12] Father. Lord Jesus, we so thank you. We
[21:14] ask that you bless each person they
[21:16] would give now. In the name of Jesus
[21:18] Christ, we pray. Amen.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen.
[21:24] Thanks, brother Darren. As the
[21:26] deacons are receiving the morning tithes
[21:29] and offerings, God bless you. Maybe we
[21:31] can sing together. The children are
[21:33] going to get ready to come in just now,
[21:34] but we can just stand for a few more
[21:36] moments.
[21:39] Joy to the world.
[21:42] Joy to the world. The Lord is come. Let
[21:48] earth receive her king.
[21:53] Let every heart prepare him.
[21:59] And heaven and nature sing. And heaven

[22:08] and nature sing.

[22:16] men their songs employ
[22:22] while fields and flood rocks hills and
[22:26] plain repeat the sounding joy repeat the
[22:31] sounding joy. Repeat repeat the sounding
[22:37] joy.
[22:39] Oh foolless sin and sorrows praise your
[22:44] soul in the ground.
[22:49] He comes to
[22:52] his place.
[22:55] Far as the curse is found. Far as the
[22:59] curse is found. Far as far as the curse
[23:04] is found.
[23:06] He rules the world with truth and grace
[23:11] and makes the nations prove
[23:17] the glories of his rightousness
[23:22] and wonders of his love and wonders of
[23:27] his love and wonderers
[23:31] of his love.
[23:35] Amen. Why don't you have your seats this
[23:37] morning?
[24:22] Silent
[24:24] night,
[24:26] holy
[24:27] night.

[28:48] &gt;&gt; Very, very wonderful and very
[28:50] appropriate. And uh we have an
[28:53] announcement we'd like to make this
[28:54] morning. I was hand handed this note.
[28:58] And I just thought as as the children
[28:59] were singing, it wasn't too many years
[29:01] ago that a couple of young people were
[29:03] standing on the steps. So there's an
[29:06] announcement to be made. It's a special
[29:08] announcement. and brother Ron and sister
[29:11] Star Caldwell along with brother John
[29:14] and sister Sharon Andes they've got here
[29:17] in Capitol are thrilled to announce
[29:26] &gt;&gt; theater and sister Jack are getting

[29:42] Go tell it on the mountain.
[29:46] Also, I guess we should uh the
[29:48] engagement of Sister Jessica Caldwell
[29:51] and brother Timothy Andes. Amen. And the
[29:54] crowd goes wild apparently. God bless
[29:57] you.
[30:08] And just one last announcement, because
[30:10] there is no service on Wednesday, we
[30:12] will be having a fellowship night on
[30:14] Friday night at 7:00. And that will just
[30:18] be uh the sisters will have some uh
[30:20] desserts and coffees and stuff that's
[30:22] prepared for us. It's a nice evening
[30:24] time of fellowship. You're all welcome.

[30:30] uh are away with their families and some
[30:32] are still home here in Cloverdale and we
[30:34] just like to have a nice evening. So all
[30:36] is welcome Friday night at 7:00 here in
[30:39] the fellowship room. God bless you.

[31:54] door.
[31:59] Oh, I'm ready for deliverance.
[32:04] Oh Lord, I've never been
[32:08] before. I can't see. I can see
[32:13] that holy grail.
[32:19] No one will be able.
[32:25] Oh my heart.
[32:28] You spread my wings.
[32:32] Lord, I've never been there before
[32:39] my life.
[32:41] It's just about time.
[32:45] I can see my father standing at the door
[32:53] of the wilderness.
[32:55] I'm ready for the living.
[32:59] Lord, I've never been born.
[33:04] Oh, what a day. What a day that will be
[33:10] to save the victory.
[33:14] Walking through those gates where
[33:19] oh we see one another.
[33:24] Every sister, every brother, Lord, I've
[33:28] never been there before.
[33:32] Oh, let's come together now.
[33:41] I can see my father
[33:44] as
[33:51] I

[34:03] Amen.
[34:05] Our
[34:34] Father,
[34:36] in heaven.
[34:40] How will be thy name?
[34:46] Thy kingdom come.
[34:50] Thy will be done on earth as it is in
[34:56] heaven.
[35:00] For thine
[35:03] is the kingom.
[35:06] Thine
[35:09] is the power
[35:12] and the glory

[35:22] Amen.
[35:36] Give us,
[35:38] Lord, give us
[35:42] this day our daily
[35:45] bread.
[35:48] And forgive us,
[35:51] forgive us, Lord. Forgive us of our
[35:58] debt.
[36:01] For thine
[36:04] is the kingom.
[36:08] Thine
[36:10] is the power
[36:14] and the glory
[36:17] forever.
[36:20] Forever.
[36:23] Amen.
[36:36] Lead us
[36:39] from temptation.
[36:43] Lead us from temptation.
[36:48] But deliver us.
[36:52] Deliver
[36:53] us from evil to thy salvation.
[37:01] For thine
[37:04] is the kingom.
[37:08] Thine
[37:10] is the power
[37:13] and the glory
[37:17] forever.
[37:20] Amen.
[37:30] is the kingom.
[37:33] Th
[37:36] is the power
[37:39] and the glory
[37:43] forever.
[37:46] Forever.
[37:50] Amen.
[38:13] Grace, she's going to sing the chorus
[38:15] just a couple more times as our pastor's
[38:17] coming this morning. Sounds beautiful,
[38:19] doesn't it? Amen. I just want to hear it
[38:21] just a couple more times as they're
[38:22] getting ready.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; For
[38:27] is the kingom.
[38:30] Thine
[38:33] is the power
[38:36] and the glory
[38:40] forever.
[38:43] Forever.
[38:46] Amen.
[38:52] For thine
[38:55] is the kingom.
[38:58] Thine
[39:01] is the power
[39:04] and the gloryy
[39:07] forever.
[39:13] Amen.
[39:24] Amen.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; We agree with that, don't we?
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let thy kingdom come.
[39:33] Let thy will be done on earth as it is
[39:35] in heaven. And our brother Jay and
[39:38] Sister Grace Bey, uh they're holding a
[39:41] new family.
[39:44] Hallelujah.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; We're happy for them. You happy, Brother
[39:48] Jay? You're happy. It's all right.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; I guess I should ask you, Sister Gracie.
[39:56] It doesn't look like they're uh
[39:58] suffering uh from malnutrition.
[40:02] They're doing real well. Well, uh, our
[40:05] brother Jay and sister Grace,
[40:09] uh, wanted to dedicate their child
[40:12] today, and I thought it was so
[40:14] appropriate,
[40:16] uh, the giving of gifts. The world will
[40:19] be taken up and is so taken up with it.
[40:23] But God decided to give them a gift
[40:26] &gt;&gt; and give them another gift. And
[40:30] I don't know how many more gifts
[40:35] But anyway, brother Jay and Sister
[40:37] Gracie just decided to give him back to
[40:39] God.
[40:41] And I think that's a good idea, too.
[40:44] Yes, sir.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Uh
[40:47] he received this priceless gift, Brother
[40:49] Jade, Sister Grace, this son perhaps
[40:53] unexpectedly.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Yes. and uh are asking now for divine
[40:58] wisdom to
[41:00] guide and train this child.
[41:03] Uh they've called him Daniel
[41:07] and Judah. Daniel Judah.
[41:11] Uh I I was thinking now for 2 three days
[41:14] about this and I thought that uh I'm
[41:17] going to be praying that God will
[41:21] give us a Daniel
[41:23] and if time should go on that he would
[41:26] be what we all identify Daniel as a man
[41:28] of prayer.
[41:30] A man who was unashamed to pray.
[41:34] A man who was unashamed to give his life
[41:38] in humility. And also in the midst of uh
[41:42] being lifted up, he himself was not
[41:45] lifted up. He he took whatever
[41:49] whatever was happening. He just took it.
[41:52] And uh even though they made a great
[41:54] statue and in honor of him and heaped
[41:57] honor on him, he wouldn't eat the king's
[42:00] bread. He wanted to live a simple life.
[42:03] And then when he was praying, he prayed
[42:05] and opened up the window. And when he
[42:08] was uh re when he was persecuted and
[42:10] cast into the dungeon with the lions, he
[42:15] still trusted that same God. And then
[42:18] brother Jay said that uh he recalls me
[42:22] speaking about Judah and the threat to
[42:24] the seed line and they decided to give
[42:27] him that name as well, Daniel Judah. And
[42:31] I want to say to you, brother Jay and
[42:33] Sister Gracie, that uh Judah was a
[42:36] remarkable
[42:37] a remarkable person himself.
[42:40] And that in that he interceded. He was
[42:44] the one who interceded. And I just do
[42:46] not know the full depths of the
[42:48] spiritual ramifications of this
[42:51] scripture, but he interceded for
[42:53] Benjamin. And we know that Benjamin
[42:56] according to the prophet's message is
[42:59] that 144,000 that remnant. And he
[43:02] interceded to Joseph.
[43:05] And Joseph was a perfect type of Christ.
[43:07] and he didn't know him. But he
[43:09] interceded to Joseph that he would that
[43:12] he would allow Benjamin to re to let him
[43:17] be in hisstead instead of Benjamin
[43:19] because he said and and his thought was
[43:22] completely not for himself but for his
[43:24] father especially for his father which
[43:26] was aged and he said my father will go
[43:29] down to the grave with his gray hairs if
[43:32] he doesn't have Benjamin. I had two
[43:34] brothers and here he's talking to the
[43:36] one. He didn't know it. And so there's
[43:39] some I'm just praying that the spirit of
[43:42] uh intercession and the spirit of prayer
[43:45] will be upon this child.
[43:48] And the Bible says I'm going to say this
[43:50] in closing. The secret the scripture you
[43:53] know well the secret things belong unto
[43:55] the Lord our God. But those things which
[43:59] are revealed
[44:01] belong to us and to our children.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; And I would never want you to forget
[44:07] that the things that God has revealed to
[44:09] you and made known to you in this
[44:10] message belong to these children.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; And that you'll teach them in it and
[44:15] show them the way. Amen.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; We're dedicate them in the name of the
[44:20] Lord.
[44:23] Daniel, Judah,
[44:25] here you are.
[44:27] Hallelujah.
[44:30] We'll pray together. Heavenly Father, as
[44:33] I hold this gem, this child, this son
[44:37] that you gave to our brother Jay and
[44:41] Sister Grace,
[44:43] you gave him as a gift and now they're
[44:46] asking, Father, that you will receive
[44:49] receive what's in their hearts to return
[44:52] him to your service and to return him to
[44:55] your work and to return him, oh God, to
[44:57] your care and your keeping. May your
[45:00] Holy Spirit be upon him and illuminate
[45:02] him. Father, I pray, Father, that you'll
[45:05] keep him in good health and strength. I
[45:08] pray you'll put, oh God, a spirit of God
[45:10] upon him, that he will feel uh he will
[45:13] feel a hunger and a desire for you. I
[45:17] pray, dear Lord Jesus, and he hears your
[45:19] name, that he will respond to it so
[45:23] quickly. May the spirit of God be upon
[45:26] him. We dedicate Lord Daniel Judah in
[45:31] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[45:34] Amen.
[45:36] Hallelujah.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Sing amen.
[45:41] God bless you, brother J. Amen. God
[45:44] bless you.
[45:46] Amen. Is that it?
[45:51] I said that's it.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Here we are.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Congratulations to the brother Tim and
[46:00] and uh sister Jessica. Yes, it is. I I'm
[46:06] I'm afraid of sometimes saying names in
[46:08] case I get the wrong name.
[46:10] Want to make sure that we have it right.
[46:13] Uh
[46:15] this is going to be a little bit of a
[46:17] different service. Uh I'm going to say a
[46:20] few words about the faith challenge
[46:22] report which just was printed this week.
[46:25] And I want to ask this congregation,
[46:28] I'll say a little more about it a little
[46:29] further on, but I would like to ask this
[46:31] congregation, if you please assist us.
[46:34] There's tremendous amount of work, not
[46:38] going in and printing this. Tremendous
[46:40] amount of work by the translators and
[46:44] the laborers and the ministers and the
[46:46] workers that are scattered
[46:49] everywhere. And this last Wednesday, if
[46:52] you were here at service, you heard
[46:55] brotherh brother Jason Neimar. And
[46:59] brother Jason, I I did not know. I was
[47:02] not acquainted with brother Jason. I had
[47:04] heard his name through brother Matthew
[47:06] Dertie some years ago. I I thought he
[47:10] was way in the eastern state somewhere
[47:12] and I discovered later that he was in
[47:15] Minnesota. We became acquainted actually
[47:18] when I responded to the Iranian young
[47:22] couple. They were just in their 30s and
[47:25] uh I responded to them to invite them to
[47:29] be able to immigrate to Canada because
[47:31] they were United Nations
[47:34] uh refugees from Iran and she needed a
[47:38] heart uh pacemaker in her heart. She had
[47:41] one but she needed it replaced right
[47:44] away. So we were trying to get them to
[47:46] come here and we worked very very hard
[47:49] and we were not successful. The Canadian
[47:52] government finally denied it uh because
[47:55] of the health issue. I think they didn't
[47:57] say. So anyway, but brother Jason, I
[48:00] knew that he had worked with the um in
[48:03] the Middle East and Turkey and Iran and
[48:06] especially with Iranian refugees that
[48:09] are coming into Turkey
[48:11] and some Syrians and so on. And so I
[48:14] never put oursel forward to uh engage in
[48:18] anything that we were here and I just
[48:20] wanted to know a little bit more about
[48:21] their work. And I just felt we just
[48:24] leave it at a very very uh quiet and
[48:27] remain uninvolved. And if God I' I've
[48:31] been you're looking at a person that
[48:32] feels very very strongly about God
[48:36] opening the door. If God doesn't open a
[48:39] door, friend, don't try to put forth it
[48:41] open. If God opens a door, then you just
[48:44] walk through it and yield yourself to
[48:46] it. And so, Brother Jason came here and
[48:50] brother Tim talked to him and spent a
[48:53] couple days with him. And brother Tom
[48:55] and Brother Murphy and brother John, we
[48:58] all were able to meet together and just
[49:01] fellowship and let him feel our spirit
[49:03] and and we could get better acquainted
[49:06] with him. Well, he went home and from
[49:08] Wednesday till now Sunday, he has sent
[49:12] uh perhaps you should tell us, brother
[49:15] Tim.
[49:17] 18 messages. There was
[49:20] &gt;&gt; a total of 18 messages. Uh 12 of them
[49:24] were Farsy which are Iranian and six of
[49:27] them are Armenian. Armenia is a country
[49:31] over there. So 18 of those messages and
[49:34] at this time we have over 30 in the
[49:36] Persian language which is the Farsy
[49:39] language which is Iranian Iranian
[49:41] language. And uh uh how many of them are
[49:45] up on the hub now? 30
[49:47] &gt;&gt; 27
[49:48] &gt;&gt; 27 are on the hub and we have enough for
[49:50] it'll soon be just about 40. Can you
[49:53] believe that? And this a very very
[49:56] restricted and oppressive
[49:59] uh uh country and enemy of Israel. But
[50:03] it's not a and we're there are people
[50:06] there that are under severe persecution.
[50:09] And we found out that one of the best
[50:11] and finest and most respected ministers,
[50:15] is in prison, and not only in prison, is
[50:18] in very poor health, is bleeding
[50:21] internally. And and I was so happy to
[50:24] find out that brother Jason knows him
[50:26] and knows his wife and speaks to her on
[50:28] a regular basis, just encouraging her.
[50:32] And uh
[50:34] they they certainly deserve our prayers.
[50:37] They certainly deserve, you know, our
[50:39] heartfelt prayers. No, God, remember
[50:42] them. And and as Apostle Paul said,
[50:44] remember my bonds. Remember those that
[50:47] are in bonds. And so we do want to do
[50:50] more than just remember by hearing it
[50:52] over the pulpit. Take it home in your
[50:54] heart. But uh and and and God, in fact,
[50:58] his brother Jason was going to set up
[51:00] his own website.
[51:03] And when he saw what was taking place
[51:04] here, he just abandoned it and said,
[51:06] "The hub is already set up and that's
[51:08] the way to go." So they're just loading
[51:11] them up there. And we were very clear to
[51:14] let them know that the hub doesn't
[51:16] belong to us. The hub belongs to the
[51:18] bride.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; And so I'd like to ask you to assist us
[51:24] by uh uh you've got some friends
[51:28] and pick up some of the faith challenge
[51:31] report.
[51:32] and and and send them out to them.
[51:36] Let them get them, excuse me, and uh
[51:41] ask them if they would like to hear more
[51:43] what's going on. In the central in the
[51:46] center page is a spread out.
[51:50] Excuse me.
[51:53] That is a a a
[51:55] central foldout page that starts with
[51:58] the work in India.
[52:00] God opened the door and that starts in
[52:03] 1981
[52:05] when that first little handheld press,
[52:08] handfed press was uh bought
[52:12] and went every month right through to
[52:16] 212 2012.
[52:19] Only God can do that, friends. That's no
[52:23] no personal. We give all the glory to
[52:25] our Lord Jesus Christ. So, please pick
[52:28] them up and send them to some and let
[52:32] your friends know if you'd like to be
[52:33] put on the mailing list. That's the
[52:35] whole thing. I I just traveled. The
[52:38] reason why this is a burden to me, I've
[52:40] just gone I've just met a lot of people
[52:41] in the last 30 days and they don't get a
[52:45] message. They would like to, oh, they
[52:49] don't know what's going on. And I think
[52:51] that's a shame. I think we should let
[52:53] everybody, you young people, you all got
[52:55] friends. Send them to those friends.
[52:57] Send them up. Hey, here this is what's
[52:59] happening, you know, because a lot of
[53:01] young people, they don't perhaps even
[53:02] know or families or whoever. Send it to
[53:05] businessmen or whatever. Let them know
[53:07] what's what's taking place. There's a
[53:09] lot of churches just aren't, you know,
[53:12] don't don't have the same exposure. I
[53:14] don't know why God led us this way, but
[53:16] he has.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; And so, we say, "Praise God."
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; We're going to run with it. God bless
[53:23] you.
[53:24] Well,
[53:27] are we ready for the word?
[53:30] &gt;&gt; All right. This is going to be a little
[53:31] different service for me and I've really
[53:33] been wondering just how God will lead
[53:36] us, but he will lead us. Amen. Let's
[53:38] stand. And
[53:47] before we read the scripture, we'll
[53:49] pray.
[53:51] Heavenly Father, we've heard the
[53:53] children singing, the congregation
[53:55] singing, the special singing, the baby
[53:58] dedication. How we thank you for these
[54:01] things. Oh God, we are such a blessed
[54:04] people and we do not want to uh we do
[54:07] not want to be laxidasical about the
[54:10] blessings of God. We thank you. We have
[54:12] freedom to worship like this. How many
[54:15] there are in different places of the
[54:17] world would dearly love to be together.
[54:19] How many others, Lord, are streaming and
[54:21] would love to be here just now and
[54:24] worship together and be able to blend
[54:27] their voices. Oh God, I say we are so
[54:32] privileged to be able to open our mouths
[54:35] and say, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[54:38] and all that is within me. Praise and
[54:41] bless his holy name." God, we just owe
[54:44] you everything that we have. Thank you
[54:46] for health. Thank you for strength.
[54:48] Thank you for Jesus. Thank you for
[54:50] salvation, oh God. Thank you for the
[54:53] cleansing and the infilling of the Holy
[54:56] Spirit. Purge us, Lord. Forgive us our
[54:58] wrongs, our weaknesses, our sins,
[55:01] anything, oh God, whether we know of it
[55:04] or do not know of it. I pray that you
[55:06] will cleanse us, oh God. I pray, Father,
[55:08] that you will give us the ability of the
[55:11] Holy Spirit. Give us eyes to see, Lord,
[55:14] where we're at and what is happening and
[55:17] where we are in your economy. I pray
[55:20] that you will invigorate us, oh God. I
[55:23] pray you will take all of any effect or
[55:26] influence of Leodysia. Remove it out of
[55:28] us, oh God. We don't want to go that
[55:31] direction at all. We want to be fervent
[55:34] for the gospel of Jesus Christ. Pray
[55:36] you'll anoint Father uh my speaking and
[55:39] anoint father. I pray the people as they
[55:42] hear. I pray father that you will
[55:45] receive all the glory. We are here to
[55:48] glorify the name of Jesus Christ. And
[55:51] while others are racing around and
[55:53] wearing themselves out in this Christmas
[55:56] season, we are here at rest. We are in
[55:59] perfect peace. Oh God, thank you for
[56:02] this message and the messenger that you
[56:04] sent. and we want to give honor to you
[56:06] by giving honor to the word that you
[56:08] sent us in the name of the Lord Jesus
[56:10] Christ. Amen.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. As you take your
[56:16] Bibles, I'm going to read some familiar
[56:19] scripture that we read at this time of
[56:21] the year, but the message will be, I
[56:23] think, quite different for you. Uh we'll
[56:25] start in Luke the 2 chapter
[56:30] and verse 8.
[56:42] We'll read down to verse 16. Then I have
[56:45] a two verses I want to read out of John
[56:48] 20.
[56:50] That's where it may seem to be a little
[56:52] strange because one is his
[56:56] birth and the other is his death.
[57:02] And I want to speak on the gift came
[57:05] back.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Came back quite a few times.
[57:14] And there were in the same country
[57:16] shepherds abiding in the field, keeping
[57:19] watch over their flock by night. And lo,
[57:22] the angel of the Lord came upon them,
[57:24] and the glory of the Lord shone around
[57:27] about them, and they were sore afraid.
[57:31] And the angel said unto them, "Fear not,
[57:32] for behold, I bring you good tidings of
[57:35] great joy, which shall be to all people,
[57:38] for unto you is born this day in the
[57:40] city of David a Savior, which is Christ
[57:43] the Lord." Hallelujah. And this shall be
[57:46] a sign unto you, you shall find the babe
[57:49] wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a
[57:52] manger. And the prophet said the
[57:54] swaddling clothes was the was the cloth
[57:56] that came off of the yolk of an oxen.
[57:59] And suddenly there was with the angel a
[58:02] multitude of the heavenly hosts praising
[58:04] God and saying, "Glory to God in the
[58:07] highest and on earth peace and good will
[58:10] toward men." And it came to pass as the
[58:13] angels were gone away from them into
[58:15] heaven, the shepherds said one to
[58:17] another, "Let us now go even unto
[58:20] Bethlehem, and see this thing which has
[58:23] come to pass, which the Lord hath made
[58:26] known unto us." I wish there were more
[58:28] shepherds even today. Let us go and see
[58:32] what's happened. Let's go and see what
[58:34] is what is uh the Lord has done. Let's
[58:37] let's find out about it. Amen. And be
[58:40] sincere.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:43] And the Bible says uh and they came with
[58:46] haste and found Mary and Joseph and the
[58:49] babe lying in a manger. And now,
[58:54] so now they see a baby in a manger. In
[58:58] John the 20th chapter
[59:01] and verse 15,
[59:04] Mary has come to the suppler
[59:08] and uh sees and sees that there's angels
[59:12] have spoken to her and uh and Jesus said
[59:17] unto the unto her, she doesn't know it's
[59:20] Jesus. He's standing in the garden and
[59:24] and said,"Woman, why weepest thou?
[59:28] Whom seekest thou?" And she supposing
[59:32] him to be the gardener, saith unto him,
[59:35] Sir, if if you have borne him hence,
[59:39] tell me where thou hast laid him, and I
[59:42] will take him away. And Jesus saith unto
[59:45] her, Mary. And I want to stop there. God
[59:49] bless his word to our hearts. You may be
[59:51] seated.
[1:00:05] You'll need to have uh
[1:00:09] your full focus this morning to follow
[1:00:12] through.
[1:00:13] I've labored very much diligently
[1:00:17] for this service and I trust it will be
[1:00:21] more than a blessing to you. I trust it
[1:00:23] will be something you'll be able to put
[1:00:25] into your heart and especially to those
[1:00:28] that have some years in front of them. I
[1:00:30] want you young men and young ladies to
[1:00:34] pay very strict attention and capture
[1:00:37] the thought. And if there's something
[1:00:39] you don't understand or a question
[1:00:41] arises, jot it down. Remember it if you
[1:00:46] would and you can come to me and I'll be
[1:00:48] delighted to speak to you further about
[1:00:50] that.
[1:00:52] This is a season when the world is just
[1:00:56] completely
[1:00:57] given over to
[1:01:00] uh the gift giving and the
[1:01:02] commercialization of this Christmas
[1:01:05] season. And it's it's a it's really sad.
[1:01:08] There's a lot of sadness that takes
[1:01:10] place at this time of the year. Uh,
[1:01:14] and we don't want to even speak about
[1:01:16] that at all. We know that the lamb of
[1:01:19] God, Jesus Christ, was not born in
[1:01:22] December to begin with. We we know that.
[1:01:24] We accept that. Brother Brandon preached
[1:01:26] his Christmas messages at this time of
[1:01:29] the year because it seems that's when
[1:01:31] people are in that uh kind of in that
[1:01:34] space or in that um emotionally uh
[1:01:38] adjusted to that and so they have uh uh
[1:01:43] he has spoken his Christmas message at
[1:01:45] this time and so I've read this
[1:01:48] scripture but I'm going to take it a
[1:01:50] little different angle. Uh to me it life
[1:01:53] is far more precious. You have we have
[1:01:57] life and the promise of eternal life.
[1:02:00] This is the most precious thing uh that
[1:02:03] we can think of. I think just now for a
[1:02:06] moment the uh there's parents of the 26
[1:02:10] children in uh Connecticut. I believe it
[1:02:14] is New Town. And if you ask them at this
[1:02:18] Christmas season, what is the most
[1:02:22] desirous thing that you have that you
[1:02:26] can even imagine? What would you uh what
[1:02:30] would you like to have? And I'm sure
[1:02:33] they would say life.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Life.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Just give me my child back. Have all the
[1:02:39] trinkets. Have all the turkey. Have
[1:02:42] everything else. Have all the
[1:02:44] celebration. Just give me my child back.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Life is the precious item.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; And you that are sitting here breathing,
[1:02:53] we have life
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; and we have it for a purpose.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; And we're not here to be idle. We're
[1:02:59] here God has given you. And that life
[1:03:01] belongs to God.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; He's the one who gave it to you. And the
[1:03:05] breath of every man is in God's hand.
[1:03:07] And when your breath stops, you're gone.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; And like the song says, then what?
[1:03:15] You want to think about that
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; and live your life
[1:03:21] as though you're ready to die at any
[1:03:23] time.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; I can tell you that town and America as
[1:03:28] a whole never expected to deal with such
[1:03:31] an incredible massacre.
[1:03:34] And it seems to me when I first heard
[1:03:36] it, I said, "It's tribulation. Right.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; It's it's we're living right in the
[1:03:42] shadows of it.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; We're not having to wait for
[1:03:45] tribulation. It's like it's it's like
[1:03:48] the tribulation is like it's imposing
[1:03:50] itself upon us
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; almost prematurely.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; We're still here and we know we're here
[1:03:56] for a rapture.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; I hope you know that. And if you don't
[1:03:59] know that, all you have to do is read
[1:04:01] the newspaper and you want to say, "God,
[1:04:04] make me ready.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Help me realize where we're at.
[1:04:09] at this time
[1:04:12] there was an account of a and I I want
[1:04:15] uh on the screen uh just that first
[1:04:19] slide in a moment I'll just give you a
[1:04:22] moment there was an account of a world
[1:04:25] war
[1:04:27] flying fortress crew and I thought it's
[1:04:30] so wonderful to have our brother Edwin
[1:04:32] Dodd here this morning God bless brother
[1:04:34] Edwin pilot of a B-58 8 that carried
[1:04:40] hydrogen nuclear bombs.
[1:04:43] And this man was a pilot of the plane.
[1:04:47] And he was uh received citation by the
[1:04:50] United States president
[1:04:52] for
[1:04:54] keeping his crew
[1:04:57] safe when there was a fire on the plane.
[1:05:01] And he was able to get it out. And he
[1:05:03] did something that was very and the
[1:05:04] reason he received a citation is because
[1:05:07] the instruments were showing that the
[1:05:10] fire had been dealt with. But he flew
[1:05:12] into the clouds because it swept back
[1:05:16] wings like this. And he flew into the
[1:05:18] clouds to see if there was any
[1:05:21] reflection of the fire. And apparently
[1:05:22] there still was some. And they took some
[1:05:24] other measures and the fire was put out
[1:05:27] and he saved that B-58 bomber worth
[1:05:31] hundreds of millions of dollars and
[1:05:33] hydrogen bombs. Who knows what would
[1:05:35] have happened? And this man sitting
[1:05:37] right here, a believer of this message
[1:05:40] sitting here today. God bless you,
[1:05:41] brother Edwin.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:54] this plane. You can put it up on the
[1:05:55] screen if you would please.
[1:06:00] This is an old flying fortress. I won't
[1:06:02] say old. This is a second second world
[1:06:04] war flying fortress and they were I
[1:06:08] think B28s
[1:06:10] or B uh B17s
[1:06:14] and maybe I don't know what the other
[1:06:16] they were more than one class of them.
[1:06:19] And the reason I'm showing this is
[1:06:21] because the crew on one of these planes
[1:06:25] were flying in a very very dangerous
[1:06:27] bombing
[1:06:29] uh mission during the Second World War
[1:06:31] and they were under very heavy fire
[1:06:34] attack with anti-aircraft fire.
[1:06:38] and the flack. You know, some of you
[1:06:40] young people may not know what flack is,
[1:06:41] but they fire the anti-aircraft shells
[1:06:45] and then they burst and explode and uh
[1:06:49] you see black uh explosion all over the
[1:06:53] place and they were under very very
[1:06:54] heavy fire. And there was a chaplain on
[1:06:58] the plane and the chaplain came over the
[1:07:01] sound system of the aircraft and
[1:07:03] everyone of course is hearing and he
[1:07:06] said to the men, "Have no fear, men, for
[1:07:10] the presence of God surrounds you."
[1:07:15] And uh in the midst of all of that
[1:07:17] confusion and war and sound and fighting
[1:07:20] and gunfire and and them trying to
[1:07:24] protect the plane, I can't show it to
[1:07:26] you exactly, but uh
[1:07:35] way back here at the end.
[1:07:38] Not not that rear wheel down here.
[1:07:44] way back here. You see there's a couple
[1:07:46] guns way way way at the back right there
[1:07:48] at the bubble right there. Here's a
[1:07:50] bubble at front. They have some guns and
[1:07:53] there's a bubble way back there. The
[1:07:55] couple guns and he's sitting all by
[1:07:57] himself. That's a massive massive
[1:07:59] aircraft. And he's sitting all there by
[1:08:02] himself. And he hears the chaplain's
[1:08:05] voice, "Have no fear, man. The presence
[1:08:08] of God surrounds you." and he spoke on
[1:08:12] his and he says he says that's okay for
[1:08:15] you guys up in the front and in the
[1:08:18] cockpit but he's not way down here where
[1:08:23] I'm sitting all alone and he just just
[1:08:26] as he said that one of these
[1:08:29] anti-aircraft
[1:08:30] missile shells shot right through the
[1:08:33] fuselage of the plane and didn't explode
[1:08:37] and left two big holes where it went in
[1:08:40] and went out. And he came back on the he
[1:08:44] came back on the speaker and he said,
[1:08:46] "Correction,
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; God just walked in."
[1:08:54] So, you can take that off.
[1:08:58] I'm going to be using that theme.
[1:09:01] The prophet spoke on the world falling
[1:09:03] apart again.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; And back then it was falling apart.
[1:09:09] And the shepherds were just doing what
[1:09:11] they always do, hurting their sheep. And
[1:09:15] they had to have announcement.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; This world isn't falling apart. There's
[1:09:19] a correction.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; God just walked in.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; I thought of the first time. My mind
[1:09:30] immediately goes through the Bible. I
[1:09:32] was on the subject when I heard this
[1:09:34] account of this bomber and I thought how
[1:09:37] fitting that is. I had to get up and go
[1:09:40] to my study and start making some notes
[1:09:42] because it was coming so quickly upon my
[1:09:45] mind. And I thought of all of the uh
[1:09:48] precious things that God could have
[1:09:50] given what God did for this gunner and
[1:09:54] his and the men that were on that plane.
[1:09:57] He gave them the gift of life.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; And for whatever reason, that shell did
[1:10:02] not explode and preserved and gave those
[1:10:05] men life. And I say that was the best
[1:10:08] thing that God could have given them.
[1:10:10] And for whatever reason, we do not know.
[1:10:12] Maybe somebody was praying for them. We
[1:10:14] don't know.
[1:10:16] The Bible tells us about Adam. I'm just
[1:10:18] going to go quickly through the
[1:10:20] scripture with you. That he possessed he
[1:10:23] actually possessed this priceless gift
[1:10:26] of eternal life. He actually had it. And
[1:10:30] and it isn't as though he lost it in a
[1:10:33] permanent way, but he forfeited the
[1:10:35] right to eternal life. And brother
[1:10:38] Brandham speaks about him. He says, "But
[1:10:40] what God did, he breathed the breath of
[1:10:42] eternal life," speaking of Adam. "And
[1:10:44] then he became a living soul, a soul
[1:10:47] that can't die." Breathed the breath of
[1:10:50] eternal life into his nostrils and he
[1:10:53] became an eternal soul. Then in uh in
[1:10:57] the Hebrew series, he said God made a
[1:10:59] promise to Abraham. He says, "Adam, if
[1:11:03] you will not touch that tree, you'll
[1:11:06] live forever."
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; And then quickly we see God's children
[1:11:11] fell.
[1:11:13] What a tragedy. What a crisis. And in
[1:11:16] the in the messages all the way through,
[1:11:18] he the prophetist spoke on uh on
[1:11:20] conference with God. And he says when
[1:11:23] there's a crisis,
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; these boys in this plane were in a
[1:11:26] crisis. And when the world's in a crisis
[1:11:29] or a family's in a crisis or an
[1:11:32] individual's in a crisis, and I'm
[1:11:34] speaking to you directly today,
[1:11:37] everybody experiences a crisis.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Don't forget in the middle of the
[1:11:41] crisis, just when you think God isn't
[1:11:44] there, You'll you'll want to be able to
[1:11:47] say and you'll need to be able to say
[1:11:49] correction. God just walked in.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; And Adam had lost his inheritance and
[1:11:58] lost his life. And the prophet says in
[1:12:00] the breach that he turned loose the word
[1:12:03] and sold out. He lost also his
[1:12:06] inheritance. He didn't just lose his
[1:12:08] life. He lost his inheritance in his
[1:12:10] life.
[1:12:14] We all know what an inheritance is.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; And some of you may be written your
[1:12:19] names may even be in in a human will and
[1:12:22] you don't know it.
[1:12:24] And someone will die and make the will
[1:12:27] effective. And the Bible says that the
[1:12:30] will is not effective. The testament is
[1:12:33] not effective without the death of the
[1:12:35] testator. So the testator has to die.
[1:12:39] You don't even know you're in the will.
[1:12:41] And then you'll get called and you must
[1:12:43] come to an attorney's office, a lawyer's
[1:12:46] office. And the lawyer will sit there as
[1:12:48] a as the executive of the estate and
[1:12:52] will say, "Uh, I have the will of your
[1:12:56] loved one, your father, your mother,
[1:12:58] your uncle, or whoever. And in the will,
[1:13:02] you've been included. And I' you've been
[1:13:04] called here. You have been called here."
[1:13:08] And I say you have been called here
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; because you've been left in a will
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; and one of my duties is to express to
[1:13:15] you what is in that will.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; And when you walk in you are you are in
[1:13:24] the same state you were the week before,
[1:13:26] the day before or the year before. But
[1:13:29] as the will is being read then you find
[1:13:32] out maybe to John I have left my car or
[1:13:37] to uh to Mary the wife or whatever we've
[1:13:40] left the house I have left the house and
[1:13:43] and these are the details and and when
[1:13:47] you walk out you have a piece of paper
[1:13:50] you have a piece of paper and now you
[1:13:52] have the house based on that piece of
[1:13:55] paper you have the car based on that
[1:13:58] piece of paper. I have a piece of paper
[1:14:01] here that says that healing is yours.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; I have a piece of paper here that says
[1:14:06] if you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:14:09] thou shalt be saved.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; That's what God's will. And God is not a
[1:14:15] man that can lie.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; God can only speak the truth. The
[1:14:19] question is, do you receive the will?
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; That is that's more than poetic license.
[1:14:27] That's the truth.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; And Adam had lost his life and lost his
[1:14:33] inheritance in his life. For he said,
[1:14:35] "In the day thou eatest thereof, thou
[1:14:37] shalt surely die." And when he lost his
[1:14:39] life, he also lost his inheritance in
[1:14:42] life. So a crisis happened. And in the
[1:14:46] midst of this crisis, perhaps they
[1:14:48] didn't even realize perhaps how deep the
[1:14:50] crisis is. Sometimes in this world, this
[1:14:53] is a thing that I I've noticed. Listen
[1:14:56] very closely now. I have found and I've
[1:15:00] stood off and looked at people's lives
[1:15:02] and determined that they are in a much
[1:15:05] worse situation than they realize.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; They're in a very dangerous situation.
[1:15:11] The go the Satan has his anti-aircraft
[1:15:15] attack or his aircraft attack on this
[1:15:19] life on this home and whatever more. I
[1:15:21] say, God, open our eyes
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; so we can see things as they really are
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; and let's not live dangerously.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Let's live safely.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Let's live sheltered in the hands of
[1:15:34] almighty God. You agree with me?
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching with all my heart tonight
[1:15:40] this morning, friends, because I we
[1:15:42] we're in a real crisis time. This world
[1:15:45] is a sick world
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; and there's thousands of directions that
[1:15:52] people are going and saying this is the
[1:15:54] truth and this is the truth and this it
[1:15:56] can't all be the truth.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Somebody's lying
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; and somebody's telling the truth.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; And I uh you say well how can we know?
[1:16:06] I'm here as your friend. I'm here as a
[1:16:09] minister of Jesus Christ. And I'm saying
[1:16:11] to you, if we haven't got any other way
[1:16:13] to know, I would seek out where God has
[1:16:16] vindicated and proven supernaturally
[1:16:20] that this is not a man.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; It no man can do this.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Search the world and find if anybody can
[1:16:27] do this. And if nobody can do it and and
[1:16:29] and they're declaring Jesus Christ and
[1:16:33] and preaching the truth of God's word,
[1:16:36] if they're doing that, then I would
[1:16:38] attach myself to that man or that person
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; or that truth.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Let God vindicate it. And then say, "I
[1:16:46] didn't vindicate it. You did it.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; You did it supernaturally. and I'm
[1:16:51] simply following what you what you
[1:16:54] proved
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; and what you stood behind.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Don't you think that would be good
[1:16:58] advice?
[1:17:00] So a crisis happened and and the prophet
[1:17:03] said in conferences
[1:17:05] the first conference was a Eden
[1:17:09] conference
[1:17:10] and God
[1:17:12] that the first conference that God ever
[1:17:14] held was the first emergency arose and
[1:17:19] we'll call it the Eden Conference. And
[1:17:22] this was the first emergency when word
[1:17:24] came up to heaven that God's son and his
[1:17:28] daughter his children that he had put in
[1:17:32] Eden had lost their place of grace lost
[1:17:36] their place in grace and had gone away
[1:17:39] from God and was backsliden and naked.
[1:17:43] He said, "No doubt." But what many of
[1:17:45] the angels wanted to go down, wanted to
[1:17:49] go down and see if they could do
[1:17:50] something about it, but God wanted to
[1:17:53] hold the conference himself.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was his child that was in
[1:18:00] trouble and he couldn't trust it to any
[1:18:02] angels. And he said a wonderful
[1:18:04] statement. I don't recall remembering it
[1:18:06] before. I want to leave it with you. And
[1:18:08] he says, "And heaven couldn't hold him
[1:18:11] any longer.
[1:18:14] Aren't you glad heaven couldn't hold
[1:18:16] them any longer? And while Adam and Eve
[1:18:19] are walking around now, having fallen
[1:18:22] from grace,
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; but God walked in.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; And Adam could have said, "But God just
[1:18:31] walked in."
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; And they heard the voice of God walking
[1:18:36] in the garden saying, "Adam, Adam, where
[1:18:41] art thou? Oh, what a heavenly father we
[1:18:44] have. Friends, we don't want to get
[1:18:46] caught up in this little rat race down
[1:18:48] here. All this tinsel and junk and
[1:18:51] stuff. People receiving things they
[1:18:54] don't need and stuff they don't want and
[1:18:56] all the rest of people are so caught up
[1:18:58] in it. Let us here this morning say
[1:19:02] thank you father.
[1:19:04] In this generation, I don't want to get
[1:19:06] ahead of myself, but in this generation,
[1:19:10] I I while I was busy with my religion
[1:19:13] and my organization and my beliefs and
[1:19:16] all of my traditions and all my stuff,
[1:19:21] you walked in.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; While I was in the middle of all of this
[1:19:26] uh warfare
[1:19:28] and struggle in my life,
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; God walked in.
[1:19:34] you know it was him.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Heaven couldn't hold him any longer and
[1:19:39] they heard his voice walking in the
[1:19:42] garden in the cool of the day.
[1:19:45] There were other times when God stepped
[1:19:48] down and walked in
[1:19:52] after the flood. I'm going real quickly
[1:19:54] now. After the flood, the people got
[1:19:57] together and they said, "We've just come
[1:19:59] through a horrific destruction.
[1:20:04] All humanity wiped off. All flesh wiped
[1:20:07] off
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; off the map." And they said, "Let us
[1:20:10] build a city and let us build a tower."
[1:20:14] What is that? That's protection.
[1:20:17] That's that's maybe like uh the nations
[1:20:20] of the world right now, they're racing
[1:20:22] for intercontinental missiles. That's
[1:20:25] nothing more than the tower.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Let's let's have a security system up
[1:20:29] here. We lived in the far north and
[1:20:31] after the Second World War, they said,
[1:20:34] "We don't know what's going to happen.
[1:20:35] We know that we've entered into an
[1:20:37] atomic warfare. We we've entered into
[1:20:39] another season and now there's a
[1:20:43] potential to actually destroy the earth
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; and we've got to have a a security
[1:20:49] system. So they started the North NORAD
[1:20:53] across northern Canada. And then every
[1:20:56] so many hundreds of miles they'd have
[1:20:58] another string of them. And one of them
[1:21:00] right here, you may not know it, but you
[1:21:03] were at the camp down at Horizon in
[1:21:05] Birch Bay. And that was one of the
[1:21:08] connections from the Arctic and because
[1:21:11] they were fearful of the Russians
[1:21:13] sending missiles over and come across
[1:21:16] and they would detect them up in the
[1:21:17] Canadian Arctic and send the signal
[1:21:20] down. And one of them that's why 60
[1:21:22] acres is given over the horizon camp.
[1:21:26] That's what that was. And there's huge
[1:21:28] concrete structure right there. Now it's
[1:21:30] because the thing has become so
[1:21:32] advanced. I hadn't intended on even
[1:21:34] getting into this, but it'll bring it
[1:21:35] real to you. That's what that spot was
[1:21:38] all about. And then they had a string of
[1:21:40] them across the United States to alert
[1:21:42] the military that missiles are coming.
[1:21:45] That's a let's build a tower.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Let's build a wall. Let's build a city.
[1:21:51] Let's look after our economy. Let's
[1:21:54] protect ourselves. And God looked on it.
[1:21:57] And the Bible says, "And God came down.
[1:22:02] What are you silly people doing?
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; This will never protect you.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Missiles will never protect us.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; The men in Washington, the men in
[1:22:15] Ottawa, and the and the intellectuals of
[1:22:18] of of Europe, they haven't got the
[1:22:21] answer. Right.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; So, I'm saying to you very plainly, I I
[1:22:26] feel I preach differently right now
[1:22:27] because I never know when my last one is
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; and I want it to be good.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; They haven't got the answer.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; It's a complete dilemma.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; And so God, he said, I will certainly
[1:22:44] return. No, he said uh and the Lord and
[1:22:47] the Lord came down to see the city and
[1:22:50] to see the tower which the children of
[1:22:53] men builded. And he's still doing it.
[1:22:56] Listen friends, a prophet came in this
[1:22:58] generation and I think a lot of people
[1:23:00] think it lightly. A lot of people even
[1:23:03] because they don't understand it, they
[1:23:04] just put it out of their mind. And they
[1:23:07] were talking about all the uh
[1:23:10] un not unseen but uh unidentified flying
[1:23:14] objects and they say and then people you
[1:23:17] know they uh say well one landed here
[1:23:20] and one landed all gets into kind of a a
[1:23:24] space that we can't really fully
[1:23:26] describe. And I won't say every one of
[1:23:29] them, but a prophet of God said, and
[1:23:32] don't forget when I say prophet of God,
[1:23:34] I'm talking about vindicated prophet,
[1:23:37] proven prophet, somebody that spoke of
[1:23:40] the scriptures. And when he spoke of the
[1:23:42] scriptures, this book became open, that
[1:23:44] kind of prophet, and revealed the secret
[1:23:47] of the heart of men and women by the
[1:23:49] thousands. That kind of prophet. And he
[1:23:52] said, "They're investigating angels."
[1:23:55] That's no mystery. That's exactly what
[1:23:57] Genesis said in. And they came down.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; God came down
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; to see the city. So, what are you people
[1:24:05] doing? And to see the tower. Oh, we're
[1:24:08] protecting ourselves. Don't fool
[1:24:10] yourself. We're not protecting those
[1:24:12] missiles and bombs and the and the
[1:24:14] peacemaker missile and all of these
[1:24:16] great intercontinental and the hydrogen
[1:24:19] bombs and all of this military stuff. I
[1:24:21] won't protect you.
[1:24:24] You got to have something that's under
[1:24:26] the um something made out of feathers,
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; under the wings of the almighty God.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; And so God came down.
[1:24:40] Abraham
[1:24:43] after waiting
[1:24:45] about 25 years older and older and older
[1:24:49] and more infertile all the time and he's
[1:24:53] sitting in his tent drawer in the heat
[1:24:55] of the day. Nothing's happened
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; for 25 years. Or you might think, "Oh,
[1:25:00] he had wonderful communion with God. You
[1:25:03] take and read and you can read in the
[1:25:05] scripture. Please do it
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; as I have done it. And I have read and I
[1:25:09] took my watch out and I time and I read
[1:25:12] I try to read at the time the same speed
[1:25:15] God would speak.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; And I I read every communication that
[1:25:20] God spoke to Abraham in 25 years and
[1:25:25] it's about 12 minutes.
[1:25:30] You're quiet.
[1:25:33] We expect God to be our our little Aaron
[1:25:36] boy. Do this, do that, do that, help me
[1:25:39] here, help me there, help me in my exam,
[1:25:42] help me in my test, help me with this,
[1:25:43] and help me with my job and help me with
[1:25:46] all the rest of it. Help me raising my
[1:25:47] kids and all the rest of it. He just
[1:25:49] pours his blessings out and say, "Hey,
[1:25:53] don't don't ask me so much. Just believe
[1:25:55] what I already said."
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm looking for somebody to
[1:26:02] believe me.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; And Abraham just said, he believes God.
[1:26:06] The Bible says he believes God. And he's
[1:26:09] sitting in this tent door. God's talked
[1:26:11] to him for 12 minutes in the last 25
[1:26:14] years. And he's sitting there still
[1:26:17] childless. And he's coming close to a
[1:26:20] hundred. And with all of that, maybe it
[1:26:23] could on his mind. He could have said
[1:26:26] what the gutter said. Just a moment. I
[1:26:29] see three men. God just walked in.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; God just walked in.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Right in the midst of this. Right in the
[1:26:40] midst of when I I failed. Did you ever
[1:26:43] fail?
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Abram failed.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; We're all there.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; I failed. You failed. Abraham failed.
[1:26:52] David failed. The prophets failed. The
[1:26:55] pro our prophet said there was flaws in
[1:26:57] every one of the prophets. They all
[1:26:59] failed.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; But that did not stop the program of God
[1:27:04] because God kept walking in
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; and God walked in
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; and God spoke to him and he bargained
[1:27:15] with God over Sodom. It was the same
[1:27:17] situation. The world was falling apart
[1:27:20] back then, his world at least.
[1:27:23] And he spoke to God,
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; "Surely you won't destroy the righteous
[1:27:28] with the wicked."
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; And he was started with 50 and went down
[1:27:33] to 10. They couldn't find 10. Couldn't
[1:27:36] find 10.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; It's a sobering thought when we're
[1:27:42] sitting here probably a few hundred
[1:27:44] people. We're sitting here and and he
[1:27:47] couldn't find 10. I pray if that same
[1:27:51] God came and walked amongst us here now
[1:27:54] as he has with his word, he'll find
[1:27:56] righteous ones who have anchored their
[1:27:59] soul
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; in the haven of rest.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're at peace.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; You're my father.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; They said to Jesus, "How should we
[1:28:10] pray?" First words, "Our Father."
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a blessed thing,
[1:28:16] brother Ernie. We might have we might
[1:28:19] have our relatives leave us down here,
[1:28:21] but he will never leave us. And he will
[1:28:24] never forsake us.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; And he knows every detail of our lives.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; And God came down. And he lifted up his
[1:28:32] eyes and looked and lo, three men stood
[1:28:34] by him. And when he saw them, he ran to
[1:28:37] meet them.
[1:28:39] From the tent door, bowed himself toward
[1:28:42] the ground. I trust we would all have
[1:28:44] that. Run to meet him.
[1:28:48] Don't have someone have to drag you to
[1:28:49] church. Run to meet him.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; When he begins to reveal himself to you,
[1:28:56] lay down your life. Bow yourself down.
[1:28:59] I'm yours.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; I'll give my all. I'll yield to you.
[1:29:04] What? What are you doing in this
[1:29:06] generation? Here I am.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Some of you may have to go against your
[1:29:15] natural nature. Your nature might be,
[1:29:17] you know, calm and laidback and don't
[1:29:20] take anything too serious. You better
[1:29:22] take this generation serious.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; You better take this message serious.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; And when you see this and feel the
[1:29:31] straining of the Holy Spirit and
[1:29:34] straining at your life
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; and telling you this is not the way, you
[1:29:38] better listen to that voice.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Help me out, folks. Amen.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; And the Lord and he said,"Lord, I now if
[1:29:52] I found favor in your sight, pass not
[1:29:54] away, I pray thee, from my servant." And
[1:29:57] down just a little further. And he said,
[1:30:00] and the Lord speaking to him, this one
[1:30:03] who just stepped in,
[1:30:05] don't tell me he didn't have doubts and
[1:30:07] fears, but God just stepped in.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; And he said, I will certainly return
[1:30:14] unto you according to the time of life.
[1:30:17] And Sarah thy wife shall have a son.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; The thing you've desired,
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; you've desired from God. If it's a godly
[1:30:25] desire, you shall have it. Amen.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever things you desire when you
[1:30:31] pray.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Say it.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Believe.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Say it again.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Believe.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Believe. You that didn't say it. Say it
[1:30:39] again.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Believe.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; When you pray, believe
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; that you shall receive it and you shall
[1:30:47] have it.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; God just walked in, folks. God just
[1:30:53] walked in. That's God's words, not my
[1:30:56] words. That's God's words.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; You may think about Abraham because you
[1:31:08] identify with Abraham. Let me as God's
[1:31:11] servant now identify with God. God's
[1:31:14] coming in and he's saying
[1:31:17] walking up,
[1:31:20] put some material together and walked
[1:31:22] into a body.
[1:31:25] You're walking out because he has
[1:31:26] something to do.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; He's walking in a body because he's got
[1:31:29] to speak a certain language that this
[1:31:31] man, his servant, understands
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; and he's coming up to Abraham. He's sure
[1:31:36] Abraham will recognize him and identify
[1:31:39] him from these other two that are
[1:31:41] angels. and and and Abraham bows down,
[1:31:44] tells his wife and tells the young man,
[1:31:46] "Go and get some meat and get a young
[1:31:49] calf and a good one and and bring it and
[1:31:52] and and tells his wife to prepare some
[1:31:54] loaves." And he's standing there and
[1:31:58] they're feeding and he's standing there
[1:31:59] watching them
[1:32:02] and in the mind of God,
[1:32:06] God knew and he said it in the word.
[1:32:09] He's tried this man for 25 years.
[1:32:13] I've tried him for 25 years. I have to
[1:32:15] make sure that he's a solid one because
[1:32:19] he's going to be part of the foundation
[1:32:21] that I'm going to build my masterpiece
[1:32:23] on.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; It's the first corner.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; You've never heard me speak on this.
[1:32:31] I've never ever thought of it before.
[1:32:33] But this is God. I'm speaking on his
[1:32:34] behalf. This is a corner. This is the
[1:32:37] first corner of my foundation of my
[1:32:40] masterpiece.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; And he saw in his masterpiece, the
[1:32:44] prophet said that masterpiece was so
[1:32:47] much like him and his perfect image that
[1:32:50] the author himself stepped into the
[1:32:53] masterpiece and he became the God man.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; And now I'm going to give him a message.
[1:33:02] He's crying for a son for inheritance.
[1:33:06] But I want the next corner to my
[1:33:08] masterpiece.
[1:33:10] And I will return to you according to
[1:33:12] the time of life. And your wife shall
[1:33:15] have a son. Sarah shall have a son. But
[1:33:18] in God's mind, that's the next corner to
[1:33:20] my foundation.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; And God came down. Amen.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; When it looks hopeless and to you and
[1:33:31] some may be on the internet today, you
[1:33:34] may be in a situation looks hopeless.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; I can tell you this, God will come in.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you'll say, "And God
[1:33:42] stepped in
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; at the critical moment." He stepped in
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; and God was set the second
[1:33:51] corner to the masterpiece foundation.
[1:33:55] Then
[1:33:56] when he came to Moses,
[1:33:59] he said, "I'm the God of Abraham,
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Isaac, and Jacob."
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; That's three corners.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; And the fourth one was Joseph.
[1:34:09] Hallelujah.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; And we spoke of Joseph today dedicating
[1:34:13] the baby Daniel and Judah. Daniel,
[1:34:15] Judah, because Judah was one of the
[1:34:18] patriarchs. And he's pleading with uh
[1:34:21] interceding with Joseph. And Joseph
[1:34:25] perfect type the prophet said perfect
[1:34:27] type of Jesus Christ and he kept himself
[1:34:30] what did he do? He kept himself
[1:34:31] concealed which what oh I hope you have
[1:34:35] understanding that's why we talk about
[1:34:37] the seals all the time is because he
[1:34:40] Joseph kept himself concealed
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; until this end time
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; when God stepped in.
[1:34:50] And we'll talk more about it as we go
[1:34:52] along.
[1:34:56] And the foundation is laid through
[1:34:58] faith, love, grace,
[1:35:00] and to perfection through the
[1:35:02] patriarchs.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; But he says, "Now the body work, the
[1:35:07] body of Jesus Christ
[1:35:10] came to his this great masterpiece."
[1:35:14] The body work. I want to say this slowly
[1:35:17] now. The body work. the body. God's
[1:35:21] dealing with the foundation, Abraham,
[1:35:23] Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. And now he's
[1:35:27] going to build the masterpiece. The body
[1:35:31] was built by the prophets.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Because the word came to the prophets
[1:35:39] and the masterpiece was to be the word.
[1:35:42] And that's why I read for you just a
[1:35:45] Sunday or two ago this uh now the birth
[1:35:49] of Jesus Christ was on this wise.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Do you remember it?
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; A lot of you don't remember
[1:35:59] the birth of Jesus Christ was on this
[1:36:01] wise. In other words, listen class. This
[1:36:05] is how it happened.
[1:36:08] Whereas Joseph took his wife wife Mary
[1:36:14] and he had not known her and told him
[1:36:18] what is conceived in her is of the Holy
[1:36:21] Ghost.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; And when he he gave detail of all the
[1:36:25] details listen now all the details. Now
[1:36:29] I'm tying it together with another one
[1:36:31] expecting you to be mature believers.
[1:36:34] I'm tying it together with another one
[1:36:36] where the prophet now has said the body
[1:36:39] was built by the prophets.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; God put the foundation down. But the
[1:36:46] prophets built the body of Jesus Christ
[1:36:49] and from the very birth and he said
[1:36:52] these words. I like them so much uh just
[1:36:57] so you'll follow it. And now the birth
[1:37:01] of Jesus Christ was on this wise. What
[1:37:05] do you get out of that?
[1:37:08] I wouldn't be wrong in saying this is
[1:37:10] how it happened.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Would that be right?
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; This is how it happened.
[1:37:18] When his mother Mary was a spouse to
[1:37:21] Joseph, so she was engaged to Joseph.
[1:37:26] Before they came together, she was found
[1:37:28] with a child. She's found pregnant.
[1:37:33] And ju Joseph being a a man of
[1:37:37] integrity, not willing to make a public
[1:37:39] example.
[1:37:41] And he was mind he was minded in his
[1:37:44] mind I should put her away.
[1:37:47] But while he thought on these things,
[1:37:49] the angel of the Lord appeared to him in
[1:37:51] a dream and said, "Joseph, thou son of
[1:37:54] David, fear not to take unto thee Mary
[1:37:57] thy wife,
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; for that which is conceived in her is of
[1:38:01] the Holy Ghost."
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Now the word comes to the prophet,
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; and the spirit comes to the word.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; I want a yay or a nay. Amen.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; The word comes to the prophet and the
[1:38:16] spirit comes to the word.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; God has given the man
[1:38:23] human seed.
[1:38:28] Semen
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; seed.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; And you as women may conceive as a
[1:38:35] mother or a wife conceive seed. But if
[1:38:40] that spirit, that breath of God does not
[1:38:44] enter that body, you'll have a still
[1:38:47] birth.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; And everyone who's sitting here did not
[1:38:50] have a still birth. That's why you're
[1:38:52] here.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; And God permitted you to come on earth
[1:38:55] because he's got a purpose in your life.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; And one of the main purposes is he's
[1:39:00] going to present you with the gospel and
[1:39:02] see what you're going to do with it.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Is that clear? Amen.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; And this is how Jesus was born. And it
[1:39:12] says, "And she shall bring forth a son."
[1:39:14] It's not finished. She will bring forth
[1:39:16] a son, and you will call his name Jesus,
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; for he shall save his people from their
[1:39:23] sins.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; That's what he's going to do.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; And now all of this was done. All of
[1:39:28] what was done. Just what we just said.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; This is how it happened. How it
[1:39:34] happened. This was all done. all done
[1:39:37] that it might be fulfilled
[1:39:40] which was spoken of the Lord by the
[1:39:43] prophets. So the prophets spoke the word
[1:39:46] of the Lord. Now instead of God coming
[1:39:48] down in a body, he used the bodies of
[1:39:51] the prophets
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; and bypassed their own intelligence and
[1:39:55] spoke his word out of their mouth. And
[1:39:58] that word created whatever it spoke
[1:40:00] about. And when a prophet said, "A
[1:40:02] virgin shall conceive," a virgin did
[1:40:05] conceive.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Many other women conceive, but this one
[1:40:09] was different.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; This one was a young virgin girl,
[1:40:12] perhaps 15 years old. And the prophet of
[1:40:15] God comes in the end time to take the
[1:40:17] mystery away from it and says that the
[1:40:20] words of those prophets spoken hundreds
[1:40:23] of years ago anchored in her womb.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, don't just sit here
[1:40:31] looking at me today. I'm preaching
[1:40:33] Matthew the words of this prophet and
[1:40:36] even those prophets. I got some
[1:40:38] statements here by Tommy Osborne I'm
[1:40:40] going to have you read in a little
[1:40:41] while. And and and he says he says this
[1:40:44] was he he spoke about Elijah. He was
[1:40:46] speaking about brother Brandon's
[1:40:47] ministry. He said Elijah didn't do that.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Moses didn't do that. He said this is
[1:40:54] another generation.
[1:40:56] Amen.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; I ask you,
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; what has this prophet's word done for
[1:41:01] you?
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; What has this vindication done for you?
[1:41:05] What has almighty God who who came
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; and used this body of flesh? What has it
[1:41:11] done for you? You may say, "Oh, that's
[1:41:13] 40 years." What's 40 years?
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; In a few years, you'll even say,
[1:41:19] "Where'd the last five go to?"
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Or, "You just turned a birthday. I
[1:41:25] couldn't believe your parents said you
[1:41:27] had been here seven years. I thought it
[1:41:29] was I thought it was three or four. I
[1:41:32] couldn't believe Brother Hillbrand said
[1:41:33] you've been here seven years.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He said the boys were only seven
[1:41:37] and eight years old.
[1:41:43] We just had Orin's 18th birthday. That
[1:41:47] incredible. Orin, why don't you stand
[1:41:49] up? You're just a You were just a shrimp
[1:41:52] when I saw you. Look at this guy.
[1:41:54] Joseph, why don't you stand up? Look at
[1:41:56] these two guys. Look at the size of
[1:41:59] them.
[1:42:01] And with the passing of time, they went
[1:42:04] from 3 feet to 6 feet.
[1:42:07] God bless you. Sit down.
[1:42:12] And this is how it happened.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; There's here's brother Jay and sister.
[1:42:20] What a meeting. Sister Gracie standing
[1:42:23] here.
[1:42:24] My goodness. They have grown children
[1:42:27] older than you fellas and they're
[1:42:29] starting all over again.
[1:42:33] Maybe somebody will get some ideas. What
[1:42:36] an example. God bless you, brother Jay.
[1:42:38] And they're happy.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Then he talked about the masterpiece.
[1:42:49] The So the prophets built the body.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Stay with me because I got a ways to go
[1:42:54] and it'll be more interesting as we go
[1:42:56] along.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And now the prophet in
[1:43:00] this day says, but here at last coming
[1:43:03] up through that finally comes the
[1:43:06] masterpiece, the perfect one. No fault
[1:43:08] in him at all.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; So perfect reflected the builder
[1:43:13] himself. The builder was so perfectly
[1:43:16] reflected. His own image was reflected
[1:43:19] in his own work. God and Christ were one
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; in so much until he put his own spirit
[1:43:28] into him. It wasn't just that he
[1:43:30] appeared that way, but God his his
[1:43:34] spirit he put into him
[1:43:38] and the builder and the image and the
[1:43:40] builder became one.
[1:43:44] In the message he swore by himself. He
[1:43:47] said, "And the blood of sheep and goats
[1:43:50] held him thus far as potentially until
[1:43:53] the fullness time come." He said, "Then
[1:43:55] God came down himself."
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; There was Simeon. There was Anna.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; There was Caiaphas, the high priest.
[1:44:08] There was a priest, the Levites, and all
[1:44:11] these people. And by now they all had
[1:44:14] their ideas.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; This is how you kill the lamb and this
[1:44:18] is what you must do and we must be very
[1:44:20] very specific because you know this is
[1:44:23] what our prophets have said. said this
[1:44:25] and that and they kind of went off to
[1:44:27] the side and added to it a little bit
[1:44:30] and you know they they they uh glossed
[1:44:34] it over and as long as you come to the
[1:44:36] synagogue and you wrapped your arm up
[1:44:39] and have the facities or whatever they
[1:44:42] call them and you know the gowns and you
[1:44:45] have your long dresses and make sure
[1:44:47] your hair is just right and the young
[1:44:49] men are clean and you come to church and
[1:44:52] you put in the treasury
[1:44:54] your offerings and tithes and all of
[1:44:57] these things takes more than that.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I need the Holy Ghost." I'll
[1:45:07] tell you a good way to get the Holy
[1:45:08] Ghost to get the word first.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; And you get the word in you and the Holy
[1:45:13] Ghost will come to that world
[1:45:16] every time.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? I have so many people
[1:45:22] say, "I need the Holy Ghost." What you
[1:45:24] need is the word. You get the message
[1:45:26] into you and the Holy Ghost will come to
[1:45:28] that word every time.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, there's nothing to come to.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; It's all through the scripture. The
[1:45:39] prophet says it very clearly. And it's
[1:45:41] surprising how many people, even senior
[1:45:44] people, don't feed on the word.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; And if you don't feed on the word, you
[1:45:48] won't have a very great measure of the
[1:45:50] spirit.
[1:45:54] So the blood of sheeps and goats
[1:45:58] held him this far, held God this far as
[1:46:00] potentially until the fullness came.
[1:46:03] Then God came down himself
[1:46:06] and an angel, not a cherubam, but God
[1:46:10] came down from heaven and went all the
[1:46:13] way to hell to bring man up from hell to
[1:46:19] heaven with him.
[1:46:21] Isn't that marvelous?
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; God came all the way down, not just to
[1:46:26] earth, but he entered into a body, took
[1:46:29] the body to death, and then continued to
[1:46:32] descend even to the regions of the lost
[1:46:36] and to hell itself.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; So he could say, I've conquered death,
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; hell, and the grave.
[1:46:46] Amen.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; And because I live, you shall live also.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; And in the midst of all this religiosity
[1:46:54] and all this tradition and doing
[1:46:57] everything right, and God stepped in.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; God gave me a voice of a thousand
[1:47:06] tongues to declare this glorious thing.
[1:47:10] And God stepped in. I I can tell you
[1:47:13] that this generation, this modern
[1:47:15] society didn't baffle God.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; In the midst of this, after the second
[1:47:20] birth pain, God stepped in
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; to bring man up from hell.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; In Shreport, it said Christ was God's
[1:47:33] love gift
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; to the world.
[1:47:37] greatest gift that God ever gave
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; was his only begotten son.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; That was God's greatest gift.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; And he said God's gift,
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; hello.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Always
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; find
[1:47:54] their places.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; That's why you're here.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; God's gift has found its place in you.
[1:48:06] What do you think? How does that How do
[1:48:07] you think that makes God feel
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; when God's gift, the greatest gift
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; found its place
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; and found it in you
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit hovered over you and
[1:48:21] came to you.
[1:48:36] I'm not lost. I'm just thinking.
[1:48:39] I see brother Elias Childers.
[1:48:42] His wife and children are sitting there.
[1:48:46] Is that the boy that was in the meeting
[1:48:47] the other night? I was down. You're the
[1:48:50] boy
[1:48:52] sitting in the meeting.
[1:48:56] I came home and told my wife about you
[1:49:02] and brother Tom Frey if you had the
[1:49:04] meeting for anybody
[1:49:06] and for that boy
[1:49:09] and it was not until I started getting
[1:49:11] into brother Tom Frey felt it on his
[1:49:14] heart
[1:49:16] come and tell the children how you grew
[1:49:18] up
[1:49:19] tell the children
[1:49:22] the difficulties you had
[1:49:26] tell the young people how you dealt with
[1:49:30] things cuz we think you know you
[1:49:32] probably dealt with some of the things.
[1:49:39] I didn't know where to start and brother
[1:49:40] Tom gave a little introduction. I I just
[1:49:43] said to the kids about 30 40 of them up
[1:49:47] to some of the young men young ladies
[1:49:48] that are here.
[1:49:50] I said, 'Well,
[1:49:53] I didn't know really where to start. I
[1:49:55] just said, 'Well, my world kind of fell
[1:49:56] apart when I was six and a half and my
[1:50:00] mother died.
[1:50:02] I said, "My folks have been Catholic and
[1:50:04] we came, you know, they they were
[1:50:08] Catholic, but then they came to know
[1:50:10] Christ and their winds of Pentecost were
[1:50:14] were just beginning to sweep over the
[1:50:16] country, and they gave their life to
[1:50:18] Christ.
[1:50:20] But I says, "My world fell apart because
[1:50:22] I didn't have mom."
[1:50:25] And then we had some housekeepers.
[1:50:29] And and
[1:50:30] so I shuffle from one housekeeper to the
[1:50:33] other. Sometime we didn't have anybody.
[1:50:36] And my sister and I would have to come
[1:50:37] home from school. I'm only in grade two
[1:50:40] or grade three. and uh said we had to go
[1:50:43] back and put on dinner for my dad who
[1:50:46] was working trying to support us in hard
[1:50:48] times and then run back and have a bite
[1:50:51] of lunch with my dad and and that's when
[1:50:55] we didn't have any housekeeper. I'm not
[1:50:57] going to labor with this. I'm just
[1:50:59] simply going to say and I saw at that
[1:51:03] point when I started telling about the
[1:51:06] hardships and we had plenty of them and
[1:51:10] I'll just say this and finish
[1:51:13] from the time I was seven and just a few
[1:51:15] weeks ago I did the count and I don't
[1:51:17] know why uh nobody was asking me but I
[1:51:20] thought I should find out how many
[1:51:21] places I just lived in a lot of places
[1:51:24] and I was boarded out at this farm and
[1:51:26] that was three miles walk to school and
[1:51:28] I boarded out another place and the
[1:51:30] woman was totally blind. And I said to
[1:51:32] the kids, I've never said to you, I I I
[1:51:35] just keep these things because I don't
[1:51:37] think they're important. But I said, the
[1:51:39] the woman was totally blind and they
[1:51:41] were above middle age and never had any
[1:51:43] children. And I said, now you go to the
[1:51:46] breakfast table tomorrow morning and and
[1:51:48] I said and and cut a pancake open. They
[1:51:51] were so poor. The only thing they had
[1:51:52] was molasses.
[1:51:55] And because she was blind, she didn't
[1:51:57] want to burn the food. So she would it
[1:52:00] wasn't cooked completely. And I said,
[1:52:02] "And just have the molasses run with the
[1:52:05] dough
[1:52:06] and uncooked pancake." And I says, "That
[1:52:09] was breakfast tomorrow morning." And I
[1:52:12] said
[1:52:14] there was there was just nothing that
[1:52:16] nothing left to do. I mean, you know, I
[1:52:19] didn't sit and complain to them. That
[1:52:22] was the only thing we had to eat. and
[1:52:24] you got to hike off to school and maybe
[1:52:26] take the horses for half an half a mile
[1:52:29] to water them and cut some kindling
[1:52:31] wood. And up in the north country and
[1:52:34] Grand Prairie where brother Tim is from
[1:52:37] and his family who some of them here
[1:52:40] there's some secrets about the north
[1:52:41] they don't tell you. And that is it
[1:52:45] doesn't get light till about 9:30 10:00
[1:52:48] in the morning and it starts getting
[1:52:50] dark about 3:30 in the afternoon.
[1:52:54] 4:00
[1:52:59] whenever
[1:53:02] all I can tell you is we had to go to
[1:53:04] school in the dark and come home in the
[1:53:07] dark.
[1:53:08] And after that, you know, had to do the
[1:53:10] chores for the next day. I don't want
[1:53:12] anybody's sympathy. It's not worth it.
[1:53:16] I just thought I thought this the whole
[1:53:18] this the way the whole world lived. I
[1:53:20] didn't know any different.
[1:53:22] I thought everybody was eating up with
[1:53:24] mosquitoes. I thought everybody drove on
[1:53:27] little gravel roads and I thought that
[1:53:30] everybody got up in the dark and went
[1:53:32] home in the dark. That that was just
[1:53:34] standard. So I didn't have anything to
[1:53:36] relate it to. So did I think I was being
[1:53:38] treated bad? No, not really. But you
[1:53:40] know in the midst of all this and then
[1:53:42] you have a you have something in your
[1:53:44] heart
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; and I want to say I know you have it in
[1:53:49] your heart and especially the young
[1:53:52] people you got the whole world in front
[1:53:53] of you. You start feeling
[1:53:57] it's just not exactly right. Do you know
[1:53:59] what God is saying? He's saying you're
[1:54:01] right. It's not right.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Just just turn away from it. Just turn
[1:54:08] away from it. And that's exactly what I
[1:54:10] found. Am I off my subject? Not a bit.
[1:54:14] And then I were in church. All we knew,
[1:54:16] my wife and I, all we knew was church.
[1:54:18] Went to church. We did everything. If I
[1:54:21] had to sweep the floor, we swept the
[1:54:22] floor. Played the guitar, sang, did
[1:54:26] whatever we could do. If somebody wanted
[1:54:27] to hear a testimony, maybe give a
[1:54:29] testimony. When I got up about 18, asked
[1:54:31] me to speak. And so I preached. And then
[1:54:34] I just saw I saw the best that there was
[1:54:37] the most godly people, the most Holy
[1:54:40] Ghost people. I just started going
[1:54:45] I actually thank God I was buried up in
[1:54:48] the far north and didn't have to have
[1:54:50] contact with people. And a brother said
[1:54:53] to me,
[1:54:55] "Have you heard what Brother Brandham is
[1:54:57] preaching these days?" I said, "No, my
[1:55:01] words were this." I said, "Well, I' I've
[1:55:05] just remained kind of buried up here in
[1:55:07] the North Country and just let the rest
[1:55:10] of the world go by."
[1:55:13] That's where I was.
[1:55:16] That's where I was. I was in my tent
[1:55:18] door, not in the heat of the day, but
[1:55:20] probably in the cold.
[1:55:25] And God walked in.
[1:55:31] I tell you what, there was a lot of
[1:55:32] temptation around the country, folks.
[1:55:34] I'm just a young man like you young men.
[1:55:37] Lots of temptation around the country.
[1:55:39] Same devil,
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; same temptations,
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; same discouragement, same unbelief, same
[1:55:46] everything. And when I thought the whole
[1:55:48] world was collapsing, then God walked
[1:55:51] in.
[1:55:54] Hallelujah.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm unashamed
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; to preach this gospel because it's real
[1:56:01] and it works.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; And I can't only tell you that the
[1:56:05] candle that got lit. But I can tell you
[1:56:07] it's still burning.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; It's still real.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; And I declare it to you young ladies and
[1:56:14] young men, new families. God's got the
[1:56:17] answer.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there isn't a thing,
[1:56:22] there isn't a situation that anybody's
[1:56:24] in, but what God knows about it.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; And he will see the believer through it.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; You mean more to him as his child.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; You're his beloved ones
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; and he's going to see you through it.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; And I know that you all can relate to
[1:56:40] it. I felt it in my heart that this will
[1:56:42] relate to every person that hears me
[1:56:45] today because we're all got a such a
[1:56:48] variety of situations in our lives.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; But you have experienced a moment when
[1:56:55] you thought you were at the end
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; and you're like that gunner at the tail
[1:56:59] and you're trying to ward off all the
[1:57:01] enemy and all the thing you know and
[1:57:03] then God steps in.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Just make sure that you recognize it.
[1:57:14] Give me a few more minutes.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Mary stood outside the grave. Her world
[1:57:23] had fell apart.
[1:57:25] Her blessed savior and the one that her
[1:57:28] Messiah and the one that they gave their
[1:57:30] lives to and they followed this work,
[1:57:32] this religious group.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends?
[1:57:39] I know that you are because you're
[1:57:40] thinking it over.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; You need to commit yourself unreservedly
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; to this Lord Jesus Christ who revealed
[1:57:50] himself in this time.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; I know that God has stepped into your
[1:57:54] life. You can look back and you can say,
[1:57:57] "I was all engaged. I was all I was just
[1:57:59] at my work. I was just at my school. I
[1:58:01] was just at something. And then God
[1:58:03] stepped in.
[1:58:05] blow a hole through my my little vessel.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; There was a great flurry of events. Let
[1:58:23] me just go quickly, please. I don't want
[1:58:25] to drag you and keep you here longer
[1:58:27] than I need to. But there was a flurry
[1:58:30] of events from the time of the last
[1:58:32] supper until
[1:58:35] uh I would say that the emotions
[1:58:39] took their peaks and and plunged to
[1:58:42] their
[1:58:44] lowest point to the believers because
[1:58:48] from the last supper then finally you
[1:58:51] know the judgment hall and condemnation
[1:58:53] and the indictment and it sent him to
[1:58:56] Calvary and there he is and he's hanging
[1:58:59] the most a mimicious death, the most
[1:59:01] cruel death. Hang your leader, your
[1:59:04] spiritual leader, the pastor, the
[1:59:06] prophet.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; And he's hanging there gasping for
[1:59:10] breath between two common criminals.
[1:59:13] What could be lower than that?
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; I'll go to the tomb.
[1:59:18] I tell you what, she wasn't skipping and
[1:59:20] dancing to the tomb.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; I'll go to the supplr.
[1:59:26] I'll see if he's still there.
[1:59:29] and sees two white angels. Even that
[1:59:32] doesn't startle her too much. Said, "Who
[1:59:35] who do you seek?"
[1:59:38] Jesus.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Tell me where he is. So I can go to him.
[1:59:44] He's not here. He's risen. Doesn't
[1:59:47] compute.
[1:59:49] She goes outside.
[1:59:52] She's standing there
[1:59:54] in the midst of that sorrow and grief
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; and we all experienced times like this
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; and she she didn't even know it but God
[2:00:07] had stepped in
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; in a different wrapping.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, how I'd like to preach to you this
[2:00:13] morning.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; He was wrapped in a different wrapping.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; He stepped in
[2:00:22] and knew her name,
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; not a whole bunch of other names. He
[2:00:28] wasn't interested in a whole big church
[2:00:30] congregation success.
[2:00:33] He's in a different rapping.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Now he looks like the gardener
[2:00:39] working for a landscape group.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Sir,
[2:00:45] tell me where you put him.
[2:00:48] And still it was in her heart, I will go
[2:00:50] to him.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; And he says, Mary,
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Mary
[2:01:00] said to me, Edward
[2:01:02] said to you, Michael, said to you, Gary,
[2:01:05] call you Lisa.
[2:01:07] He knew your name. He knows your name
[2:01:09] this morning.
[2:01:11] And if you feel a twinge or something
[2:01:13] happening beyond the emotion that I'm
[2:01:15] going through,
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; but something deep
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; because he's calling your name.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you, don't miss
[2:01:23] that.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; In that darkest moment, God just stepped
[2:01:31] in.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Aren't we happy, brother Ernie?
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; I've heard your testimony many times.
[2:01:42] He's just saying it this morning.
[2:01:49] Then the world began to fall apart
[2:01:51] again.
[2:01:54] Women went to work
[2:01:57] and they were earning big money
[2:02:01] on the war project.
[2:02:05] And the boys come back
[2:02:08] and the enemy is defeated
[2:02:11] and it's crushed.
[2:02:14] People are suffering horrifically.
[2:02:18] 6 million Jews are gone.
[2:02:21] Around 76 million men and women and
[2:02:25] children
[2:02:27] died.
[2:02:29] And what do you think God now? He
[2:02:31] wouldn't even know without a prophet.
[2:02:33] Excuse me for weeping, but you wouldn't
[2:02:35] know without a prophet that the earth
[2:02:37] was convulsing with the birth pain.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; It has to bring something forth.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; And just then what broke on the scene
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; was a God man.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; A Jesus man.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:56] And God
[2:02:58] just stepped in
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; a world that was encased in darkness
[2:03:06] and such misery and such sorrow and
[2:03:08] displacement of people. And you'll see
[2:03:10] the cities are nothing but ashes
[2:03:14] in Japan lost 100,000 people.
[2:03:19] Just one bomb
[2:03:22] melted the skin on their bodies. And the
[2:03:25] Bible speaks of it that the flesh and
[2:03:27] their eyes. Well, now I'm not trying to
[2:03:29] be dramatic. I'm talking about the world
[2:03:31] you and I live in.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; And it's not getting better.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; And this Bible says it will wax worse
[2:03:42] and
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; worse
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; and
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; worse.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; And that's the world we're in.
[2:03:49] And the Holy Spirit is pleading with
[2:03:51] people from this church
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; and from others who have been touched by
[2:03:56] the message.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Don't take it casual
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; because also what this prophet says, the
[2:04:02] rapture will come and in such a way that
[2:04:05] people will be saying, well, isn't there
[2:04:08] the rapture that's supposed to happen?
[2:04:10] And he says, it will already have
[2:04:12] happened.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; I just heard that again the other day
[2:04:17] and I said,
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; oh God,
[2:04:19] Don't let me preach.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Don't let me hear these services.
[2:04:24] Don't let me believe what I believe
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; and miss that.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; And I realize you've got to have the
[2:04:31] faith
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; and believe with all your heart that if
[2:04:34] there's one going,
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; you've got to be able to declare from
[2:04:37] the depths of your soul, not because the
[2:04:39] prophet said it, but from within
[2:04:41] yourself. If there's only one going, I
[2:04:43] am going.
[2:04:48] Sometimes we have to say that in sheer
[2:04:50] faith.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; It was the world falling apart.
[2:05:00] That messenger will come and say the
[2:05:02] world is again. It's like it was, he
[2:05:04] said, 2,000 years ago. Now we've come
[2:05:07] back.
[2:05:11] And Jesus,
[2:05:13] Jesus, this lovely one, this masterpiece
[2:05:17] before going, he said,
[2:05:20] as it was to whoever would hear him, and
[2:05:23] there's many more people heard him than
[2:05:25] perhaps sitting here this morning. I
[2:05:27] don't know what they did with it, but he
[2:05:29] was saying to the congregation, and I'm
[2:05:31] saying it, I'm repeating his words,
[2:05:33] friends. These aren't brother Biscos's
[2:05:35] words. These are Jesus words. said, "As
[2:05:38] it was in the days of Noah, so shall it
[2:05:41] be in the day when the son of man," they
[2:05:45] knew who he was. They were talking about
[2:05:47] when the son of man is revealed.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; And as it was in the days of Sodom, even
[2:05:53] thus shall it be in the day when the son
[2:05:56] of man is revealed.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; Friends, we have it everywhere.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; We have it everywhere.
[2:06:04] this world. I'm not negative. I'm a very
[2:06:08] positive person. But this world is in a
[2:06:11] horrible state
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; until we even as believers
[2:06:16] don't know what to do. Kind of throw up
[2:06:18] our hands and say, "Well, you know that
[2:06:20] what are we supposed to do?
[2:06:22] This is who waits on you on your
[2:06:24] restaurant table. This is who serves you
[2:06:26] in the airlines."
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; You see it all over in the schools and
[2:06:30] the colleges and everywhere. And they're
[2:06:33] just it's just festering with
[2:06:34] perversion,
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; is it not?
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Let the people of the Lord say so.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; And God stepped in. Hallelujah.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm far from over, but I'm going to
[2:06:56] I'm going to take about the next 10
[2:06:58] minutes and have you read with me.
[2:07:13] I want to say a word about Tommy
[2:07:14] Osborne. I've been in his meetings.
[2:07:18] He was in brother Brandham's meeting, I
[2:07:20] believe, when the maniac fell at brother
[2:07:23] Brandham's feet.
[2:07:28] What he has said,
[2:07:30] don't don't put it up yet. What he has
[2:07:33] said
[2:07:35] is what he believed in his heart. He
[2:07:36] spoke these words at Brother Brandon's
[2:07:38] memorial service.
[2:07:40] and Billy Paul. And if Billy Paul hears
[2:07:43] this service, thank you, brother Billy
[2:07:44] Paul, for having this man stand up
[2:07:48] because I feel that he was a voice at
[2:07:51] least for those people to let the world
[2:07:54] and let them be condemned by their own
[2:07:56] statement.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; This is what they looked on brother
[2:08:02] Brandham and his message as. And it's
[2:08:05] not us
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; declaring it. It's him declaring it what
[2:08:10] he honestly believed
[2:08:13] and some of his statements are perhaps
[2:08:15] stronger than I have even used behind
[2:08:17] this pulpit.
[2:08:20] So I want you to hear it and absorb it
[2:08:24] more than just a reading. These are his
[2:08:28] This is his message and I've added it
[2:08:32] way down and abridged it
[2:08:37] and he's talking about brother
[2:08:39] Brandham's ministry.
[2:08:44] Can you just tell me is this Where's the
[2:08:47] clicker?
[2:08:53] I'm sorry. Thank you.
[2:09:07] It's talking about the brother Brown's
[2:09:08] ministry now and it has blown across the
[2:09:11] face of this
[2:09:14] uh our generation a fresh breath of God
[2:09:17] in this 20th century through the
[2:09:19] extraordinary ministry of God's prophet
[2:09:21] to this age the man recognized among
[2:09:25] among us by the name of William Brham.
[2:09:28] This little man because of the gift of
[2:09:30] God for ordained in his life lived and
[2:09:33] ministered completely interpenetrated
[2:09:37] with heaven and earth transcending both
[2:09:40] the seen and the unseen worlds at the
[2:09:43] same time. He couldn't help it. He
[2:09:46] couldn't avoid it.
[2:09:49] We were privileged to keep
[2:09:52] let's say
[2:10:07] now this is in quotation marks because
[2:10:10] this is someone who attended the
[2:10:11] meetings and wrote like perhaps a
[2:10:16] reporter,
[2:10:17] a Christian reporter and and here's what
[2:10:20] they said and when I come to the end
[2:10:22] I'll tell you but this was in with in
[2:10:26] Tail Osbbor's sermon.
[2:10:29] We were privileged to keep only five
[2:10:31] glorious days and nights of this
[2:10:33] celestial vigil but the effect of those
[2:10:35] memorial memorable days live on today.
[2:10:40] The people were left humbled and
[2:10:42] tendered because they know that Jesus of
[2:10:45] Nazareth had passed our way in his
[2:10:48] servant. For that holy pause, we had
[2:10:50] seemingly turned back the pages of time
[2:10:54] and joined the admiring host of
[2:10:56] followers that shuffled along the dusty
[2:10:59] trails of Galilee in faithful devotion
[2:11:02] to a lowly carpenter who claimed to be
[2:11:05] the Messiah of Israel. He's likening
[2:11:08] himself now to the what they've read in
[2:11:10] the scripture.
[2:11:13] In our visionary procession, we had
[2:11:16] passed by the place of the tombs, which
[2:11:19] erupted by a a naked demonic
[2:11:23] and screaming and hissing his objection
[2:11:25] to the presence of Christ, but sat at
[2:11:28] his feet a moment later, clothed and in
[2:11:31] his right mind.
[2:11:33] We were among the jostling mob around
[2:11:37] Jesus when he asked the abrupt question,
[2:11:40] "Who touched me?" and saw a trembling
[2:11:42] little woman cast herself at his feet
[2:11:44] and declared before all the people of
[2:11:46] what uh for what cause she had pulled at
[2:11:50] the border of his robe and how she had
[2:11:52] been healed immediately. And then we
[2:11:55] followed on to Gyrus's house and saw the
[2:11:58] raising of his daughter. We heard the
[2:12:02] plain words of a deaf and dumb child
[2:12:04] after his tongue was loosed by the
[2:12:06] master's touch and laughed to see the
[2:12:09] lame man leap for joy. We clamorred for
[2:12:12] a seaside seat with the 5,000 other men
[2:12:16] who had forsaken the anvil and the
[2:12:18] hammer and closed the doors of their
[2:12:20] shops to spend the day hours in wrapped
[2:12:23] listening to the wonderful teachings of
[2:12:27] this divine philosopher.
[2:12:30] We wept with the women as we gazed on
[2:12:33] the beautiful face and recognized the
[2:12:35] sorrow and the grief that spoke of the
[2:12:39] broken heart and felt that melting
[2:12:41] charming sensation that one glance from
[2:12:44] his kind eyes could bring to the soul.
[2:12:47] Yes, Bible days were here again. And
[2:12:51] here was a man who practiced what we
[2:12:55] preached.
[2:12:59] I say this not to exalt any human, but
[2:13:03] only to emphasize that our deep
[2:13:04] appreciation for our brother stem from
[2:13:07] the fact that his ministry seemed to
[2:13:09] bring our lover Lord Jes Lord closer to
[2:13:12] us and to better acquaint us with his
[2:13:15] living works, his personality,
[2:13:18] his deity than anything had before.
[2:13:24] God has chosen divers and mysterious
[2:13:27] ways. Now, this is TL Osborne carrying
[2:13:31] on. Now, he's finished with the article.
[2:13:34] God has chosen divers in mysterious ways
[2:13:36] to reveal himself to his servants,
[2:13:39] especially to those called for
[2:13:40] dispensational purposes as brother
[2:13:43] Brandham was called. It certainly would
[2:13:45] not be strange then that in this way he
[2:13:49] appeared to brother Brham. In short, the
[2:13:53] man we know as William Brham was sent to
[2:13:56] demonstrate God again in the flesh. But
[2:14:00] why was he sent to do this? And why all
[2:14:03] of these signs had not Jesus already
[2:14:06] done these things? Have they not already
[2:14:09] been written and recorded? Yes,
[2:14:12] absolutely. They had all been done
[2:14:14] before and men had forgotten them.
[2:14:20] So God willingly, more abundantly to
[2:14:24] show us the immutability of his counsel
[2:14:27] did it again in the 20th century. He did
[2:14:30] it again and I beheld his glory. He
[2:14:34] could have done it in the 18th century,
[2:14:36] but he did it while I was here.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; This gospel of the kingdom was to be
[2:14:41] preached as a witness to all nations and
[2:14:44] then the end would come. But what was
[2:14:46] this gospel of the kingdom? The church
[2:14:49] had forgotten. It was a generation where
[2:14:52] although many of them were religious and
[2:14:55] sincere and many of them were hungry and
[2:14:58] seeking and but yet they had forgotten
[2:15:01] what it really was like.
[2:15:05] This was the closing generation.
[2:15:07] Something had to happen. It couldn't go
[2:15:11] as past generations had gone. Therefore,
[2:15:14] in God's divine mercy, something somehow
[2:15:18] stepping beyond the bounds of ordinary
[2:15:21] measure, he had fore ordained at this
[2:15:24] hour to send again this prophet. Some
[2:15:27] are going to think that I am
[2:15:29] sacriiggious or off doctrally and it
[2:15:33] doesn't really matter. But God, he
[2:15:36] thought that one over.
[2:15:38] But God came again in human flesh and
[2:15:44] said, "Apparently,
[2:15:46] I must show them again. I must remind
[2:15:50] them again. They must see sometime once
[2:15:54] again. They must know what God is like."
[2:15:58] And he stepped down and sent a little
[2:16:01] man, a prophet, but more than a prophet.
[2:16:05] this time a Jesus man. This time Elijah
[2:16:10] was not that. This is more than that
[2:16:13] which he we have beheld. Moses was not
[2:16:16] that for because of the different
[2:16:18] dispensation in which he lived. It
[2:16:21] couldn't be what we have seen. More than
[2:16:24] that, a Jesus man, a man full of God,
[2:16:29] but sent as a special sign to a
[2:16:32] generation. in this generation a gener a
[2:16:35] supernatural sign
[2:16:38] an extraordinary measure.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:16:43] It was done before. Why do it again? To
[2:16:47] arouse this last generation once more to
[2:16:51] be the forerunner once more to be sure
[2:16:55] that the record is clear. To be sure
[2:16:59] that there is no excuse. Thus 1,200
[2:17:03] tapes,
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; thus thousands of revelations of the
[2:17:08] hearts of the people
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; and you have access to it.
[2:17:15] And to be sure that God has demonstrated
[2:17:18] a fresh to be sure that they can there
[2:17:21] can be no mistake. And to be sure that
[2:17:24] we are reminded aresh of what God is
[2:17:27] like how Jesus was and what God does in
[2:17:32] the flesh.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; God willing to be sure that we don't
[2:17:37] fail in the knowledge of the
[2:17:39] immutability of his covenant. did it
[2:17:41] again in the 20th century. That
[2:17:45] generation destined to bring him back.
[2:17:48] This generation must know,
[2:17:51] this generation must be without excuse.
[2:17:54] So he sent forth a particular human
[2:17:57] vessel surrounded by supernatural signs
[2:18:01] to attract attention and to make this
[2:18:04] wayward generation look up, ponder,
[2:18:07] search, and think. Thus the halo of
[2:18:11] light that appeared at his birth, the
[2:18:13] star, the angel, the discernment, the
[2:18:18] gifts, all of these were given for that
[2:18:21] purpose. For what? To show us God again
[2:18:25] to repent, to repeat rather what he
[2:18:28] showed us in Jesus Christ when he came
[2:18:31] in the form of flesh and to remind us
[2:18:34] one final time like Jesus. Brother Vanom
[2:18:38] red demonstrated the very thing which
[2:18:42] made man believe that the true Messiah
[2:18:45] had come.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; He was a seer.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; He saw. He lived in both worlds and seen
[2:18:54] and seen and the unseen at the same time
[2:18:57] and transcended both of them practically
[2:19:00] all the time. Jesus said, "My father
[2:19:03] workketh hither too and I work. The son
[2:19:06] can do nothing of himself but what he
[2:19:08] seeth the father do.
[2:19:11] Here comes brother Brandham along in the
[2:19:13] 20th century and does exactly the same
[2:19:15] way. God in the flesh again crossing our
[2:19:20] path and many did not know.
[2:19:23] They would not have known him if he
[2:19:26] would have been here when God crossed
[2:19:28] their path in the body that we call
[2:19:32] Jesus Christ.
[2:19:36] God who had chosen us comes down in the
[2:19:40] flesh once again to say, "I must show
[2:19:43] them again what I'm like." So that they
[2:19:47] will go with renewed zeal and remember a
[2:19:51] fresh my living word cannot change. That
[2:19:55] it is always the same. I must go and
[2:19:59] show them again.
[2:20:01] And he came down
[2:20:04] here in the form of the flesh. I'm
[2:20:06] saying this corregation.
[2:20:08] I'm feeling rather weak. I feel so
[2:20:11] expended. I feel so moved.
[2:20:16] When you thought the message,
[2:20:20] when you thought the message and you
[2:20:22] hear about it here, hither and yawn and
[2:20:24] what they're doing and what someone else
[2:20:26] are doing and what their home is like
[2:20:27] and what their church is like, that
[2:20:29] doesn't mean anything to us. God has
[2:20:31] left us without excuse.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; And this is a man who hasn't even seen
[2:20:38] what you've seen.
[2:20:45] He came down in the gain in the form of
[2:20:47] flesh as we call him William Brandom. He
[2:20:51] came across our generation, crossed our
[2:20:53] path, told us these words from the
[2:20:56] scriptures and we are to believe these
[2:20:58] words.
[2:21:01] We have walked with God in our day. He
[2:21:03] came and walked the shores of Galilee.
[2:21:05] But he also come to the streets of
[2:21:08] Phoenix, Portland, Portland, Oregon,
[2:21:11] Tulsa, Oklahoma, and across this nation.
[2:21:14] I saw it. He said, and when I was when I
[2:21:18] saw it once, I knew what it meant. This
[2:21:20] was the word in flesh.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; I could take it up and go with it. For
[2:21:29] God was with me and in me.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; What a revelation. That's what he got
[2:21:35] out of it.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; He didn't get, "Oh, now I just got to go
[2:21:39] and make Brother somebody." No. God made
[2:21:41] him somebody.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; He came to demonstrate what God was like
[2:21:47] in the flesh to say to you, "You do it.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; You live it."
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; This is God's will for this last
[2:21:57] generation. Now, you do it. I'm saying
[2:22:00] to you young and old, all of us here on
[2:22:03] the internet, all whoever may see it in
[2:22:06] the archive, I send out this challenge.
[2:22:09] Let us do it.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; Let us carry this last word to the far
[2:22:14] corners of the globe. Let us expend our
[2:22:17] energy and our life. And I say to you
[2:22:19] young people, you will never never
[2:22:21] regret it.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; You might have success. You might have
[2:22:26] fame in the world. You might become a
[2:22:28] great musician or a great athlete or
[2:22:31] something else that will rot with your
[2:22:33] body,
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; but what you do for Christ will last for
[2:22:38] all eternity.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; What a revelation.
[2:22:49] And now
[2:22:51] will you do
[2:22:53] what will you do about this message that
[2:22:57] has been pointed out so clearly to you?
[2:23:00] That's him. That's DL Osborne speaking.
[2:23:07] What shall you do with it?
[2:23:10] Shall we run with it?
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; Shall we act upon it?
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; Shall we bear it to the ends of the
[2:23:16] world?
[2:23:17] God has visited his people
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; for a great prophet has risen up amongst
[2:23:23] us
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; and I'm through.
[2:23:32] I've even asked God recently.
[2:23:35] I'm not a young man.
[2:23:39] I probably feel more burned and more
[2:23:41] pressed and more energized
[2:23:48] You don't have to stand behind the
[2:23:50] pulpit. I admire what I see
[2:23:54] and people that have witnessed
[2:23:58] that have been an example
[2:24:00] of this message. I admire you. I love
[2:24:03] your testimony. I love the testimony
[2:24:05] this church. And I say to this church,
[2:24:08] Cloverdale Bible Way, whatever you do,
[2:24:11] don't release. Don't slacken.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; Don't release. Don't give it any slack
[2:24:15] at all. Keep it Keep the cords snugged
[2:24:19] up tight.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; Keep the standard high.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; Keep the standard high.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want nothing to do with this
[2:24:28] world. This world is falling apart.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; We don't want to look like them. We
[2:24:35] don't want to talk like them. We don't
[2:24:37] want to enjoy what they enjoy.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; We're a God people.
[2:24:44] I say on the basis of this word, we're a
[2:24:46] Jesus people.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; The true Jesus people.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; And that's what the hippies desired.
[2:24:53] They wanted to be a Jesus people. They
[2:24:55] didn't know it, but there is a Jesus
[2:24:57] people.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; And by God's divine, God came back.
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; God came back, folks.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; God just stepped in. And I feel he
[2:25:10] stepped into this service in a special
[2:25:12] divine way. And don't miss your chance.
[2:25:15] Don't miss your opportunity. Say, "All
[2:25:18] to Jesus I surrender.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; All to him I freely give.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; I'll forever love and serve him.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; And in his presence daily live."
[2:25:32] Father,
[2:25:36] oh, what a time.
[2:25:38] What a day we're in.
[2:25:41] The world's all caught up in a lot of
[2:25:43] tensil and nonsense.
[2:25:48] And sin will increase even over this
[2:25:50] season.
[2:25:53] And they've missed they've missed it
[2:25:55] all. They missed the meaning of they
[2:25:56] even missed the day. They missed the
[2:25:58] time of the year.
[2:26:00] Your prophet comes and tells us
[2:26:03] he's a lamb. He's born in the spring.
[2:26:07] Born in a barn.
[2:26:09] All lambs are born in a barn.
[2:26:13] Lord Jesus,
[2:26:18] I didn't finish this message and you
[2:26:20] know what was left.
[2:26:23] I've read the words of a man that didn't
[2:26:25] go on and follow.
[2:26:28] But he left a record.
[2:26:31] A record. And his voice he will hear it
[2:26:34] all played again.
[2:26:37] of what he said
[2:26:40] and I'll hear my voice
[2:26:43] and I say even now, Father,
[2:26:46] I feel like I'm in a special
[2:26:52] protected place. Just you and me.
[2:26:56] You'll have me hear these words again.
[2:26:59] And I want to say I'm not ashamed of the
[2:27:01] gospel of Jesus Christ.
[2:27:04] It is the power of God unto salvation.
[2:27:09] Lord, there may be somebody here.
[2:27:12] I feel that there is.
[2:27:15] I wonder if there's somebody here
[2:27:19] and God is moving on you and you want to
[2:27:21] raise your hand
[2:27:23] as I want you to pray for me.
[2:27:26] I want to give my all.
[2:27:29] I haven't surrendered myself completely,
[2:27:31] but I want to give my all.
[2:27:35] Yes.
[2:27:37] God bless you. God bless you.
[2:27:40] Bless you.
[2:27:51] Father, you see the hearts.
[2:27:54] You weigh it out.
[2:27:57] Some perhaps need
[2:28:00] forgiveness. put a spirit of repentance
[2:28:02] in their heart. Even raising their hand,
[2:28:05] they're showing that I want to I want to
[2:28:08] go on. I want to give my all. Lord, take
[2:28:12] this sacrifice. Take this offering.
[2:28:15] Take these precious lives, dear ones.
[2:28:19] They're your children.
[2:28:22] You called them here. And now you're
[2:28:24] calling their name. Even through this
[2:28:26] service, they're seeing something.
[2:28:29] They're feeling something. Perhaps they
[2:28:30] cannot explain it entirely, but they
[2:28:32] know it's you that's calling
[2:28:35] and all they can say they just lift
[2:28:36] their hand or their hands say here am I
[2:28:41] Lord even as it was when Mary stood
[2:28:44] outside of the tomb outside of the
[2:28:47] sephilar she couldn't even even hadn't
[2:28:50] really identified you and and maybe some
[2:28:53] have come here and they've sat in the
[2:28:54] meetings and said yes I'm a believer and
[2:28:56] I know William Brandham's a prophet of
[2:28:59] God, but they don't realize really it
[2:29:01] was you speaking through him. And it was
[2:29:04] you until
[2:29:06] until she heard Mary,
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; Mary. And when she heard that, she
[2:29:11] responded, "Rabbon, my master."
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; And now that's what we are asking that
[2:29:18] there be a response now within the
[2:29:19] people.
[2:29:21] You've called my name.
[2:29:24] You've called my name.
[2:29:27] And I'm responding
[2:29:30] in the name of Jesus Christ. I give
[2:29:32] myself to you.
[2:29:35] Will you that raise your hands, you just
[2:29:37] say that to yourself. You don't have to
[2:29:40] say it to me, but you say it and speak
[2:29:42] it out of your mouth and say it to the
[2:29:44] Lord. Here am I.
[2:29:46] I've heard thy voice.
[2:29:51] Let's stand.
[2:29:54] I am thine, oh Lord. I've heard thy
[2:29:56] voice. And then I want to sing one of
[2:29:59] brother Derek if you can come, would you
[2:30:02] please? And uh like to sing uh what was
[2:30:06] it? He called my name. I heard his name.
[2:30:08] Yeah, I heard. But we're saying I am
[2:30:11] thine, oh Lord. I've heard thy voice.
[2:30:13] Let's just remain real real
[2:30:17] now. The service is not over.
[2:30:22] I'm thine, oh Lord. I've heard thy voice
[2:30:25] and it told thy love to me.
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; I am thy.
[2:30:36] I have heard thy voice and is
[2:30:44] thy love to me.
[2:30:52] But I long to rise in the arms of faith
[2:31:01] and be closer
[2:31:04] drawn
[2:31:06] to thee.
[2:31:10] Call me nearer,
[2:31:14] nearer,
[2:31:16] nearer. Blessed Lord
[2:31:20] to the cross
[2:31:23] ther
[2:31:36] blessed Lord
[2:31:40] to thy preious
[2:31:44] leading
[2:31:50] You know my name. And before we sing, I
[2:31:55] said I would say a little more about
[2:31:56] this. I'm not going to say any more
[2:31:58] about it. Please take some. Please send
[2:32:02] them out. Tail Osburn saying now it's
[2:32:04] not Tail Osborne. It's my I'm saying now
[2:32:08] what will we do with the message? Let's
[2:32:11] send it out. Let's get it out.
[2:32:14] And
[2:32:17] You know, you give your gifts and your
[2:32:19] tithings and your offerings.
[2:32:23] And I want you to know where we seek to
[2:32:25] be real good stewards.
[2:32:28] We've got wonderful trustees
[2:32:31] and I watch over the income. We don't
[2:32:34] have we don't have a lot of money. We're
[2:32:37] we just go along from month to month.
[2:32:40] But God has always provided. Isn't that
[2:32:42] wonderful?
[2:32:44] I was just at brother Lonnie Jenkins
[2:32:47] memorial service
[2:32:50] and I came outside. I was sitting in my
[2:32:52] car
[2:32:55] and a a little sister came over and she
[2:32:57] was so frail she was stooped over.
[2:33:03] Her son who was probably in his mid-50s
[2:33:06] was standing behind her in case she
[2:33:08] would fall.
[2:33:11] My wife rolled down the window and her
[2:33:13] mouth was shaking. Her bottom
[2:33:17] jaw was shaking.
[2:33:20] She said, "But I've known her for
[2:33:21] probably 35 years. Her husband's passed
[2:33:25] away." She said,
[2:33:28] "But do you do still do mission work?" I
[2:33:31] said, "Oh, yes."
[2:33:36] She handed me a check for $4,000.
[2:33:40] She said, "Somebody gave us a cousin
[2:33:44] gave us an inheritance
[2:33:46] and here's some of the money." I wanted
[2:33:49] to go to missions.
[2:33:51] And I thought, "God bless that sister."
[2:33:54] They they gave and supported. Otherwise,
[2:33:57] we could never have been on radio. We
[2:34:00] could never have cleaned up the tent. We
[2:34:02] could never have done what brother Tim
[2:34:04] Dodd now has taken. And I'm so thankful
[2:34:08] because this is this is the very
[2:34:11] grassroots of this congregation. And
[2:34:14] I've said to you many times if God has
[2:34:16] blessed this work, he's blessed it for
[2:34:18] one reason. That you are a testimony and
[2:34:21] that our heart, our whole passion is get
[2:34:23] it out. Find that last one. Oh, I' I'd
[2:34:27] love to cross over with this
[2:34:29] congregation and have our Lord Jesus say
[2:34:31] and maybe his messenger standing right
[2:34:34] behind beside him because he was the
[2:34:36] last one in his right hand.
[2:34:38] &gt;&gt; The last one was the seventh one.
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; The last one was Elijah and have him
[2:34:43] standing there and say, "Welcome home.
[2:34:47] You helped to bring the last one in."
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; Even if it was somebody in the
[2:34:52] congregation that witnessed, I would
[2:34:53] just be so happy. God say, "Oh, praise
[2:34:56] God. Praise God. We help to bring the
[2:34:59] last."
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; Don't think I'm off up here. I'm I'm
[2:35:09] very much
[2:35:12] very much aware of everything that's
[2:35:13] taking place.
[2:35:16] God bless you. You that raised your
[2:35:17] hands expected to be different.
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; As of this moment. Let's sing this song
[2:35:23] together with spirit.
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; He knows my name. How is the words? How
[2:35:28] do the words go? I have a maker. Okay,
[2:35:32] not too slow now. I
[2:35:40] he my heart
[2:35:45] and
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; he even
[2:35:58] know my
[2:36:04] all my every
[2:36:10] single
[2:36:22] I have a father.
[2:36:26] Isn't that wonderful?
[2:36:28] Because we still
[2:36:46] he my
[2:36:52] know my every heart
[2:37:02] and hear me.
[2:37:07] He knows my name. He knows my name.
[2:37:17] every
[2:37:21] single
[2:37:55] Just a moment. I'm not doing this. I
[2:37:57] just want to say on Monday night, next
[2:37:59] Monday, not tomorrow, but a week.
[2:38:01] Tomorrow is New Year's Eve, we'll be
[2:38:04] here thanking God. And I just have it on
[2:38:08] my heart. So, I'm just asking I would
[2:38:10] like to have the Russian people that are
[2:38:13] here that will be here to sing and give
[2:38:17] glory to God. The Philippine people and
[2:38:19] my wife are speaking. We loved it the

[2:40:46] let's pray.
[2:40:54] Hallelujah.
[2:40:58] Glory,
[2:41:00] Lord. How many of us felt like the
[2:41:02] gunner?
[2:41:05] How many of us felt alone, Lord?
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; How many of us didn't know which way to
[2:41:10] go and all hell was against us?
[2:41:14] Lord, what a change came by when Jesus
[2:41:19] came by our way.
[2:41:21] As our prophet said, then Jesus came and
[2:41:23] called,
[2:41:25] changed the whole atmosphere around us.
[2:41:27] Lord, we believe that atmosphere has
[2:41:30] changed this morning.
[2:41:38] Oh God,
[2:41:46] maybe that last one is here this
[2:41:48] morning.
[2:41:50] That would be so wonderful. Lord,
[2:41:54] the beckoning of the Holy Spirit dealing
[2:41:56] with lives.
[2:41:59] Then Jesus came down.
[2:42:03] What a Christmas.
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; What a Christmas this is. What a gift.
[2:42:08] Lord, come to the house of God and God
[2:42:11] would come down.
[2:42:13] Bless us with his presence and the word.
[2:42:16] What a gift it is to my soul.
[2:42:26] Lord, as we go our way, we think on
[2:42:28] these things.
[2:42:34] I felt like Mary this morning and you
[2:42:36] just spoke to my name and I realize
[2:42:40] you're so near, Lord.
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; Always running, always looking, but God,
[2:42:48] you're present.
[2:42:51] So, as the saints of God leave, would
[2:42:54] you go with them? And as they go in
[2:42:57] their car, may they speak of you. And as
[2:42:59] they'll have their time with their
[2:43:01] families, may the presence of God come
[2:43:02] down. May be a different Christmas,
[2:43:06] Lord.
[2:43:07] May they realize the gift of God that is
[2:43:10] present.
[2:43:12] Would you bless your children? Would you
[2:43:13] strengthen our dear pastor?
[2:43:19] We have cherished this gift Lord
[2:43:22] and we have thanked you many times over
[2:43:25] the years and we are not ashamed to
[2:43:28] stand with men of God
[2:43:31] held the banner high. We will stand
[2:43:33] shouldertosh shoulder
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; and we shall thus hold the banner high.
[2:43:38] Lord go with your people. May they go
[2:43:41] with your blessing as we commit our ways
[2:43:44] to you now in Jesus name.
[2:43:48] Amen.
[2:43:50] God bless you. Have a wonderful time
[2:43:53] with your families, with friends.
