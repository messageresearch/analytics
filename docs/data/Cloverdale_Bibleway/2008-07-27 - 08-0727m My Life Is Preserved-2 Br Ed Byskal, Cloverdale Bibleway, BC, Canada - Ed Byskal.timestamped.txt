[9:48] Invite brother Tony Abner to come and
[9:51] take these requests before the Lord. As
[9:53] we join our hearts together with them,
[9:54] we want to remember the Gonzalez family
[9:57] to please pray for Irene Gonzalez,
[10:00] brother Ricardo's mom, very serious
[10:02] illness, asking that the Lord would
[10:04] intervene on her behalf. Brother Roy
[10:07] Florent had put in a request for a
[10:10] co-orker named Jim Young. So, waiting on
[10:12] a transplant, asking that the Lord would
[10:15] grant a a donor sufficient.
[10:19] Want to remember Sister Cassia. I
[10:21] believe she's in intensive care. Doctors
[10:24] don't know exactly what's wrong. She
[10:27] goes to brother Ron Peterson's church
[10:28] down in Phoenix, Arizona. We have a
[10:31] prayer cloth to pray over from Sister
[10:34] Irene Waldner. Eileen, I believe. Uh her
[10:37] name is Heather Stillwell. Many may here
[10:40] know her. She's a trustee on the Suriri
[10:43] school board. She's just been diagnosed
[10:45] with breast cancer and
[10:49] the testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ
[10:51] is alive and well. She's recognized that
[10:54] there's a difference in the people here
[10:56] that know her and have asked that we
[10:58] would pray in faith believing.
[11:01] Sister Grace Bey has put in a testimony.
[11:03] She just wants to give the Lord all the
[11:04] glory and the thanks. Uh about a month
[11:07] ago, she was suffering with a very bad
[11:09] stomach pain. The Lord delivered her
[11:11] mightily. Sister Lana wants to say thank
[11:14] you for your prayers of lifting of her
[11:17] father before the Lord as he has spared
[11:20] his life and extended him time to be
[11:23] with her and she's enjoyed that
[11:25] immensely. If you have a need upon your
[11:27] heart this morning, desire a touch from
[11:30] the Lord, just lift your hand to him now
[11:33] as we enter into prayer together. God
[11:35] bless you, Brother Tony.
[11:40] One more quick request. Uh I believe
[11:43] many of you remember brother Anoir
[11:44] Javeed from Pakistan and his son Wakas
[11:48] has uh in need of a open heart surgery.
[11:51] He was born with a hole in his heart and
[11:53] so it's very critical and he'll be in
[11:55] surgery this week. So let us remember
[11:57] our precious brother and their little
[11:59] son Wakas.
[12:02] Heavenly Father, as we are here gathered
[12:04] in your presence again this morning,
[12:08] we Lord recognize the value and the
[12:11] importance of worship.
[12:14] For it's our part. It's our invitation
[12:17] to you that as this world is busy about
[12:20] their affairs and many are running to
[12:23] and fro and bowing at the altars of
[12:26] their own religion, their business,
[12:28] their idols of sports and so on and so
[12:31] forth. And how there's many around the
[12:33] world even today that are are calling
[12:35] upon your name but not in spirit and not
[12:37] in truth. And we know Lord you descended
[12:40] in this hour. Lord, you came to suck
[12:43] with your bride. You came to fellowship
[12:45] with your people, with with the very one
[12:47] that came forth from out of your side.
[12:50] And Lord, we want to entreat you this
[12:52] morning, not just merely to stand at the
[12:55] door knocking as a gentleman, but Lord,
[12:58] as one that wants to come in, we want
[13:01] you to feel welcome. We invite you,
[13:03] Lord. We We want to make you, Lord, and
[13:05] Lord, feel, Lord, as though you're
[13:07] desired intensely, Lord. We're here,
[13:10] Father, to hear the words of life. We're
[13:12] here to suck with you. We're here to
[13:14] have your spirit blow through this room.
[13:16] We're here, Lord, for you to descend in
[13:19] the capsule of love, Lord, for your word
[13:21] to be spoken forth through your servant
[13:23] this morning. That our faith could grow.
[13:26] That we could draw closer to you. That
[13:28] we could be more like you, Lord, our
[13:31] bridegroom, our King, our Lord, our
[13:33] Savior. Oh, how you gave yourself for
[13:35] us, Lord. And how we love you. God, we
[13:39] thank you for your grace and your mercy
[13:41] that was extended to us when we were not
[13:43] worthy, Lord, but yet you loved us. And
[13:46] we love you this morning, Father. Oh,
[13:49] God. May you grace us with your presence
[13:51] is our desire,
[13:53] Lord, you know the many needs that are
[13:55] here represented in this assembly. And
[13:57] we know that in your presence the
[14:00] supernatural will take place. We don't
[14:02] Lord have to plead and plead and plead.
[14:05] We just enter into your presence and
[14:07] there the fullness of joy and faith will
[14:09] lay hold of the promise.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're here to meet every need.
[14:14] You're here to speak to your people.
[14:16] We're here, Lord Jesus, to enter into
[14:19] this sacred chamber where the man and a
[14:23] wife will bring forth the very essence
[14:26] of life itself. And Lord, may you move
[14:29] among us. you know the many needs that
[14:32] are here. Lord, as we've remembered our
[14:34] we remember our brother Anoir and his
[14:36] little son Wakas, Lord, you can heal
[14:38] that heart. You can close up the the the
[14:41] the the openings there, Lord, even
[14:43] without a doctor, Lord. But if you so
[14:46] design that the Lord the child should be
[14:48] under operation, guide the hands of the
[14:50] physicians and may the healing and
[14:52] recovery be speedily, Lord. Amen.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; Father, our sister Eileen, her life has
[14:57] touched a a woman, a woman that's in
[15:00] need.
[15:02] Something within our sister, the spirit
[15:04] of Christ is reaching out to her. And we
[15:06] lay our hands on this prayer cloth that
[15:08] Father, as it would go to this woman in
[15:09] need, Lord, with this demon of cancer,
[15:12] may the God of our sister Eileen, Lord
[15:14] Jesus, Lord God, be recognized by this
[15:17] woman. And may you move on the scene,
[15:19] Lord, for your glory and your honor, to
[15:22] bring a soul to salvation, to bring a
[15:25] soul out of the bondage of sin that she
[15:27] might have eternal life. Father, Lord,
[15:30] we send this prayer cloth in the name of
[15:32] Jesus Christ. And Father, for others
[15:34] that didn't put in a prayer request,
[15:37] Lord, didn't rather put in a prayer
[15:39] cloth. We know the prayer of faith can
[15:41] save those that are in need. And Lord,
[15:43] we pray Lord again for sister Lana's
[15:46] father, Lord, how you've done a mighty
[15:48] work in his heart and soul. Continue to
[15:49] do the work. And for our sister Grace
[15:51] Bey, Lord, oh we pray that the request
[15:54] that she wrote, Lord, for these ones
[15:57] that Lord, this for herself, Lord, as
[15:59] she's suffering, may you touch her,
[16:01] Lord. And Lord, oh God, may you just,
[16:04] Lord, move in a special way for Lord,
[16:06] the sister in in Brother Ron Peterson's
[16:09] church. Lord, we we pray. We don't know
[16:11] what the need is. Lord, may you move in
[16:13] such a way, Lord, that she would be
[16:14] delivered and have whatever it is that
[16:16] is missing and needing in her body to
[16:19] that she would be delivered. Father, for
[16:21] brother Roy Florence and Lord, the
[16:23] coworker, oh God, that the Lord is in
[16:26] need this this very hour. May you move
[16:28] on this life as well. And for our our
[16:31] sister Irene Gonzalez, Lord, we pray for
[16:34] her. Lord, you know how serious her
[16:37] illness is, but Lord Jesus, there's
[16:39] nothing too great for you. We've seen
[16:42] you move from the smallest, littlest
[16:44] thing to the greatest because you are
[16:46] great. You are supernatural. You are,
[16:49] Lord, our portion for whatever need we
[16:51] have. And so we commit these requests to
[16:53] you, Lord, that you would just move in a
[16:55] special way. And Father, of course, for
[16:57] the ministry of the word, Lord. Feed our
[17:00] hungry souls, Lord. We need strength in
[17:04] these wicked, trying days of tribulation
[17:07] and days of judgment. Lord, let us rise
[17:10] into that go, Father, into the cliff of
[17:13] the rock. Lord, as the storms of
[17:15] adversity are blowing, Lord, as there
[17:18] the various foundations of this world
[17:20] and the economy of this governments are
[17:22] being shaken, Lord, we find our secret
[17:24] in you and in your word. Bless brother
[17:26] Ed as he would come and speak. So, we
[17:28] ask these mercies in Jesus name. Amen.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you. You may
[17:37] have your seats this morning.
[17:41] We want to make sure that we welcome
[17:43] each and every one of you to the house
[17:44] of the Lord. Those visiting with us, we
[17:47] do want to greet you as well. The senior
[17:49] choir has a special force this morning
[17:52] before our pastor comes, if they' just
[17:53] come and get ready at this time. We do
[17:55] want to uh welcome sister Grace Bey has
[17:58] written in a note, Brother Gilbert and
[18:00] Sister Barbara Leo from New uh Nelson,
[18:04] New Zealand. We want to welcome you.
[18:06] Maybe you could stand could recognize
[18:08] you where you are. God bless you. God
[18:11] bless you.
[18:15] And brother from Malawi, Brother
[18:18] Dyverson Musea. He's studying at Simon
[18:21] Fraser University. Where are you,
[18:22] brother Diversson? God bless you.
[18:26] God bless you. He's going to be here for
[18:28] a couple of years, so he might be a
[18:30] stranger right now, but that will soon
[18:32] go away. God bless you.
[18:36] Uh, we have an announcement here. The
[18:38] senior choir, go ahead and come on up.
[18:41] Brother Richard Drake has a request that
[18:44] they are going to be needing a Sunday
[18:45] school teacher this next year. And if
[18:48] you feel the Lord has been dealing with
[18:50] you lately upon teaching Sunday school,
[18:54] please contact him. We know the Lord
[18:56] works on both ends. And he shows a
[18:58] confirmation in his word. So, if the
[19:00] Lord has been dealing with you on a
[19:01] approaching somebody about Sunday
[19:03] school, Brother Richard Drake is that
[19:04] person you need to see. Amen. Well,
[19:08] we're in for a wonderful day today.
[19:11] Amen. Expectant hearts come and the Lord
[19:14] comes and great things happen. Amen. So,
[19:16] just after the senior choir gets done, I
[19:19] believe Brother Biscll's going to come
[19:20] out right away. So, God bless you.
[20:00] One day
[20:04] every eye will behold him.
[20:10] Lifted up high and exalted,
[20:17] we will behold
[20:20] the king.
[20:26] And one day
[20:30] all that supposed him will crumble.
[20:37] Every man be made humble.
[20:43] We will behold
[20:46] the king.
[20:53] And one day
[20:56] we who have waited will see him.
[21:03] We who have prayed, come quickly, Lord.
[21:11] Come
[21:13] quickly, Lord.
[21:16] It's that day that we are looking for.
[21:23] We want to see your glory.
[21:30] Oh, come quickly, Lord.
[21:37] Come
[21:39] quickly, Lord.
[21:43] You're the one that we are waiting for.
[21:49] Come quickly, Lord.
[21:58] One day
[22:01] heartache and suffering will vanish.
[22:07] Sickness and pain will be ended
[22:14] as we behold
[22:17] the king.
[22:22] Oh, and one day
[22:26] death will be conered
[22:30] forever
[22:33] and we will descend in his glory.
[22:39] And we will behold our king.
[22:47] Oh,
[22:48] the spirit and the bride
[22:52] together testify.
[22:55] Come quick with me, Lord.
[23:00] Come
[23:02] quick with me, Lord.

[27:10] Oh, he is. He is. He is Lord.
[27:16] Oh,
[27:21] come quickly,
[27:24] Lord.
[27:36] I'm sorry.
[27:40] God bless you.
[27:44] Hope you enjoyed the song. I'm sure you
[27:46] did. I want them to just remain there.
[27:49] I'd like to just sing if you'd help me
[27:50] to. Uh he's the same God
[27:54] been on my mind all all morning. He's
[27:56] the same God spoke to the woman at the
[27:59] well.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Same God that's here.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if if that is the case, then
[28:07] we should be really filled with
[28:09] expectation.
[28:12] What do you expect this morning?
[28:15] &gt;&gt; You probably get what you expect. You
[28:18] get Have you put in your order?
[28:21] That's very important. We're not here
[28:22] just to go to church. And we're not here
[28:25] just to see one another. We're not here
[28:27] to just hear something new cuz there may
[28:30] not be anything new. May not sing any
[28:33] new songs. May not meet any new people.
[28:36] But we're here to meet with him. We're
[28:38] here to go higher. We're here certainly
[28:42] to be in heavenly places with Christ
[28:44] Jesus. And that's not an imaginary
[28:46] place. That's a real place. So I wonder
[28:48] if we could just sing that together.
[28:50] He's the same God.
[28:54] Sing God
[29:16] the raing.
[29:23] He's the same God
[29:26] with me.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; Let's just worship him now as we sing
[29:31] again. He is the same God.
[29:51] Sing God
[29:54] might

[30:53] me. Hallelujah.
[30:55] Hallelujah. God bless your choir. Thank
[30:57] you.
[31:02] I want to read a scripture. This is not
[31:04] part of the actual message, but I'd like
[31:06] to read a scripture
[31:09] and it's in uh second Corinthians the
[31:13] 10th chapter.
[31:15] I just want to make a couple comments
[31:17] about that.
[31:21] Yeah, fine.
[31:25] Are you brother Joseph?
[31:30] I have a note right here and I'm going
[31:32] to welcome you. It's Brother Joseph
[31:34] Garcia. Right. No, no. Brother Joseph.
[31:38] All right. I had a note. Brother Joseph
[31:40] Garcia may be here. Is are you here,
[31:43] brother Joseph? Right back there. God
[31:46] bless you, brother Jose. Brother Joseph
[31:48] Garcia from uh actually in Burnaby right
[31:52] now. But that's brother Gar Bernie
[31:54] Garcia's son from
[31:56] from Phoenix. and he is here and uh
[32:01] doing some studying and uh his wife and
[32:05] children as well and we want to welcome
[32:08] you as well. This brother and his wife
[32:11] and family, God bless you. Happy to have
[32:14] you as well. My uh it's it's wonderful
[32:18] to have visitors and some that may not
[32:20] just be visitors. Brother Joseph Garcia
[32:23] said he's been streaming some of the
[32:24] meetings and actually looking for a
[32:26] place to live. Uh so we're we're happy
[32:30] to have them and I
[32:34] I think little
[32:36] the little anecdotes are
[32:39] you know we're human and but I I think
[32:42] it was some years ago quite a few years
[32:44] ago. Didn't you visit here once before
[32:46] with your family? Yeah, you did. Yeah,
[32:50] twice.
[32:53] Well, I remember something. Don't any
[32:54] anybody bring it up to brother Joseph. I
[32:56] believe he I believe he was one of the
[32:58] boys that was here and I I took you to a
[33:01] restaurant with the family over here and
[33:03] we had some hamburgers. I believe it was
[33:05] there was two boys there and I I'm sure
[33:07] you're one. Anyway, brother Bernie
[33:09] Garcia came up with his family and I
[33:11] took him down here to the White Spot and
[33:13] after service and Brother Joseph may not
[33:16] even remember but I think he was one of
[33:17] them bound to be. And
[33:21] and so the the waitress, you know, this
[33:24] is this is Canada and it's it's not
[33:26] quite Phoenix, but you know, we're
[33:28] getting multicultural all the time. And
[33:31] uh so he got the hamburgers there and
[33:33] and the boys asked, "Is there any
[33:36] Tabasco sauce?"
[33:39] Now you're smiling. And so I said, "Oh
[33:42] yeah, we can get that. I know what
[33:44] Tabasco sauce is. don't use much of it.
[33:46] But so we we I called the waitress and
[33:50] get us a bottle of Tabasco sauce. So she
[33:53] brings a bottle of Tabasco sauce. And
[33:55] those boys, I mean, they they baptized
[33:58] those hamburgers with Tabasco sauce and
[34:01] uh and and they emptied the bottle.
[34:05] You know, if you folks know what that
[34:07] is, they emptied the bottle and then
[34:09] they asked me, could they get any more?
[34:13] So, I called the waitress and I said,
[34:14] "Can we get another bottle of Tabasco
[34:16] sauce?" She almost lost her breath. She
[34:20] couldn't believe that they had actually
[34:22] used up a whole bottle and were asking
[34:23] for a second one. That was probably the
[34:26] first experience for her like that. But
[34:29] we we we like people who like their food
[34:32] hot and we like people who like their
[34:34] religion hot.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; So, we don't we're not into lukewarm,
[34:38] Brother Joseph. So, God bless you and
[34:40] God bless all the visitors that are
[34:42] here. We trust that you will be able to
[34:45] enjoy the service.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; Uh I'm going to read uh uh out of the
[34:52] 10th chapter of uh first Corinth 2
[34:56] Corinthians, I'm sorry.
[34:58] And uh just before we read verse 13, I'd
[35:02] like to have you bow your head and pray
[35:04] with me. Our dear heavenly father, we
[35:07] are so grateful. Our hearts are filled
[35:10] with thanksgiving
[35:12] as we had prayer this morning in the
[35:15] study before coming to the platform.
[35:19] Lord, our brother Derek came to lead the
[35:22] people in worship and they were singing
[35:24] and to hear the choir and the special
[35:27] and our our
[35:30] musicians, oh God, and each one as they
[35:33] sang. And we pray that the worship, oh
[35:36] God, is acceptable in your sight.
[35:39] We're standing here on holy ground
[35:42] because this is a place, Lord, that we
[35:44] anticipate where people have not only
[35:47] met with you, but will through the
[35:49] ministry of your word. Take us, Lord.
[35:52] We're just human vessels, but we need
[35:55] you this morning. And we pray that
[35:57] you'll minister to us by the Holy
[35:59] Spirit. Utter words to us, Lord, that
[36:02] will sink deep into our hearts. Lifech
[36:05] changing words, oh God, transformation.
[36:08] taking place in our in our lives. In the
[36:11] name of Jesus Christ, we ask it for your
[36:14] glory. Amen. Amen. Apostle Paul said in
[36:18] this uh scripture here, and I just going
[36:21] to have you standing for a few minutes.
[36:23] Uh but we will not boast of things
[36:26] without our measure or that's you know
[36:29] without the scope without the portion
[36:32] that's been given but according to the
[36:35] measure of the rule which God hath
[36:38] distributed to us a measure to reach
[36:42] even unto you.
[36:45] Uh
[36:48] I' I'd like you just to notice here that
[36:51] God hath distributed to us. I'm thinking
[36:53] of two particular uh areas right at this
[36:58] moment. And uh the congregation here and
[37:02] those of you that are visiting, you'll
[37:03] just have to listen for a moment. But we
[37:07] are responsible for whatever God
[37:09] distributes to us. Whether it's your
[37:11] individual life or your home, your
[37:15] family as a unit uh but us as
[37:18] individuals, whatever God has done in
[37:20] your life and has given to you, whether
[37:24] it be skills, whether it be resources,
[37:27] whether it be finances, whether it be
[37:30] just strength, physical strength,
[37:32] whatever God has given to us, he give it
[37:34] to us that we might serve him with it.
[37:37] and whatever God has distributed to us.
[37:40] And we're not responsible for what he's
[37:42] not distributed to us, but what he's
[37:43] distributed to us.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; And as a congregation, as a pastor, I
[37:47] feel responsible because God calls
[37:50] certain individuals. He calls you to be
[37:54] a part of the assembly. So, we
[37:57] individually are responsible, but
[37:59] collectively we're responsible. And just
[38:02] recently, one of the one of the most
[38:04] recent things that God has allowed us to
[38:07] do is to uh develop this message hub,
[38:11] which there's been people that have uh
[38:14] donated
[38:15] uh hundreds and now into thousands of
[38:17] hours to make this hub possible. And
[38:21] what what this is is most of you know,
[38:24] is is a massive digital library of
[38:27] brother Brandham's messages. and and the
[38:29] format has just been developed in the
[38:32] last few weeks, been perfected, I should
[38:34] say, and still doing some work on it.
[38:38] And as of now, there's uh about almost
[38:42] 1,500 messages on there. Most of them
[38:44] are English, but more messages are going
[38:47] up on a regular basis, and these
[38:50] messages will be able to be printed.
[38:51] Now, there are pastors and ministers
[38:53] that are really, I mean, soon as they
[38:55] see it, they catch the vision right
[38:57] away. They they they see the potential.
[38:59] Brother Barry Coffee last Sunday uh
[39:03] demonstrated in his church and actually
[39:05] had a printer on, hooked it up, just
[39:09] went to the internet, pulled down the
[39:12] whole hub, showed it to the people, and
[39:15] there happened to be a a Russian family
[39:17] from the Ukraine visiting and they were
[39:20] sitting in the church and he he he found
[39:24] that they were there. So they just
[39:26] decided to print a Russian message right
[39:28] then for them and they came up and got
[39:31] that message book in their hand actually
[39:33] in maybe 2 3 minutes or less and and got
[39:36] that message book as a result I won't
[39:39] say as a result of that but the people
[39:41] saw with their own eyes what could
[39:43] actually happen and there was a couple
[39:45] there and they were so delighted you
[39:47] have seen the video of the brothers that
[39:49] went brother Kim brother Michael went
[39:51] over to the Philippines and the pastors
[39:53] you can just imagine the joy that they
[39:55] have and there's quite a few of the
[39:57] messages in the Philippine language
[39:59] languages to galic and subano and also
[40:02] they have access to the English because
[40:04] many speak English there and so
[40:06] consequently they were you know thrilled
[40:08] with it but then then there were people
[40:10] in the congregation that came to brother
[40:12] Barry and they have purchased u uh
[40:15] they've actually purchased just on their
[40:17] own they don't have to do it through us
[40:19] at all and that's the beauty of this
[40:21] they have 18 print stations that they're
[40:23] going to be sending to Russia as a
[40:25] result of that meeting. And I think
[40:26] that's wonderful, don't you? I think
[40:28] it's absolutely wonderful. When you
[40:29] think of 18 print stations, just
[40:31] remember that each print station is
[40:33] going to uh uh minister to and supply a
[40:37] a group of churches, other churches and
[40:40] individuals. And so 18 18 print stations
[40:43] could easily be I I just average out at
[40:45] about 10 perhaps local assemblies that
[40:48] will draw on a single print station. So
[40:50] you're looking at about 180 churches. I
[40:53] think that's that's just wonderful.
[40:55] Absolutely wonderful. And so we have uh
[40:58] uh I've given uh brother Kim Dingwall uh
[41:02] we've discussed it and we're going to
[41:04] because these printers are at half price
[41:06] right now. We're going to go ahead and
[41:08] buy a hundred of them and and I think
[41:11] that's minimal, but get a 100 because
[41:13] they're going to be going everywhere
[41:15] throughout the world. And I would say
[41:17] that, you know, God has given us as a
[41:21] congregation has given us people. I
[41:24] think of the camp. Just give me a few
[41:25] minutes because I'm going to be standing
[41:27] a lot longer than you. So, you know, and
[41:29] you'll be sitting for quite a while
[41:31] after this. But God has God has allowed
[41:33] us to have this camp. Last week was 150
[41:38] young people in the camp
[41:41] plus counselors
[41:43] plus ministers
[41:45] plus the people who are spiritually
[41:48] guiding those young people. But they
[41:50] come into an atmosphere that they have
[41:53] not come into before.
[41:55] And I'll tell you why. Because God
[41:58] distributed something to you.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; And there were quite a number of you
[42:03] that were working. you're working in the
[42:05] kitchen. You're serving. And there were
[42:08] people from that camp, from the leaders
[42:10] of that camp that came and they said
[42:14] the atmosphere, the food, we've never
[42:17] had any, we've never been served like
[42:19] this. And they were so moved. Now, what
[42:23] is it that they felt it was something
[42:25] that God distributed to you
[42:28] &gt;&gt; as individuals? And there's more people
[42:30] involved than I can mention. And people
[42:33] when they come and say, "Where do you
[42:34] find these kind of men? Where do you
[42:37] find these kind of young people?" We're
[42:39] not boasting of that. We're giving glory
[42:43] to God.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; That the power of the written and spoken
[42:47] word can transform lives till it has an
[42:51] effect on other people.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; And I say God gave that to you. That's
[42:55] not something you develop. God gave that
[42:57] to you. And now they are seeing it. And
[43:00] it's our it's incumbent upon us to to
[43:04] present this to the people. And I think
[43:06] that's a wonderful opportunity. And and
[43:08] and as a result, I won't say as a
[43:10] result, as a result of the atmosphere,
[43:12] as a result of the whole camp. And my
[43:15] wife and I were talking about it coming
[43:16] here this morning, 12 children asked to
[43:20] receive Christ as savior. 12 young
[43:22] people. And my wife said, "Why didn't
[43:25] they do that before?
[43:27] Why didn't they ask that before?" And it
[43:30] just may well be I remember well as a
[43:33] young person when you're 12 and 13 and
[43:37] 14 you see somebody and you see
[43:39] something and you identify it that is
[43:42] different
[43:43] &gt;&gt; and you go away impacted for life
[43:48] &gt;&gt; is that not right
[43:49] &gt;&gt; and I think what an opportunity this
[43:51] next week we need a few other people but
[43:55] there's 150 that are coming on Monday
[43:59] morning tomorrow morning into that camp.
[44:02] And I think that there is brother Chris
[44:04] has mentioned it to me and I just took
[44:06] it much more seriously since this
[44:08] scripture came to me that God has
[44:12] distributed something to us.
[44:15] He's distributed. You say, "Well, what
[44:17] do I have?" Whatever you've heard in the
[44:19] word, has it changed your life?
[44:22] &gt;&gt; God gave you that. God has given that.
[44:24] God distributed that to you. God has
[44:26] changed your nature. God has changed
[44:28] your makeup. God has changed in a and
[44:31] brought a change in your life. And we
[44:32] can truly say there's been a change in
[44:34] me because God distributed it to you.
[44:37] And don't forget whenever you give your
[44:39] time, you give of your labors, you just
[44:42] say, "I'm a willing I I'm I'm I'm a
[44:44] candidate. I, you know, I I I'm just
[44:47] ready to do whatever I can do." That's
[44:50] because God distributed something to you
[44:52] and you're the one
[44:55] you're the only one that can give that
[44:56] out. And so God bless you in all of your
[44:59] labors and all of your efforts and and
[45:01] all everything that you've done. I say
[45:03] God bless you richly.
[45:05] Amen. And I pray that brother Chris,
[45:08] this next week will be also. And then
[45:12] right after that we go into our camp,
[45:14] our family camp. We will expect to have
[45:17] somewhere between 1,00 and,500 people on
[45:21] the grounds in the evening. And it's the
[45:23] largest camp we've ever had in the
[45:25] senior camp is 350 and we're maxed right
[45:29] out completely. I I say may I'm praying
[45:33] and that I want to ask this congregation
[45:36] if you would please take me very serious
[45:38] now. I'd like to ask you to spend
[45:40] quality time
[45:42] doesn't have to be long time but as much
[45:44] time as God deals with you to have
[45:47] prayer. I want to see the supernatural
[45:49] hand of God in the camp. We don't want
[45:52] mechanics, we want dynamics.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Along with the mechanics. And so
[45:58] may God give us a powerful supernatural.
[46:02] Pray for brother Ron Spencer one year
[46:05] ago laying unconscious between life and
[46:08] death and preaching in the camp this
[46:10] year. Amen. I I I know it was God. I
[46:14] know it was God, friends. I know it was
[46:17] God. How many remembered I called Sister
[46:18] Connie his wife? You remember
[46:23] Yes, I called her home and I knew she
[46:27] wasn't home. A son and her husband both
[46:31] in hospitals and her husband laying
[46:33] between life and death. And that I even
[46:36] got word that they may not live
[46:39] for a day or two.
[46:41] They didn't know how badly his lungs
[46:43] were damaged from the fire.
[46:46] He's unconscious.
[46:48] And I called her home. is the only
[46:50] number I had. And I knew that she wasn't
[46:52] home. And she picked up the phone, said,
[46:55] "Hello."
[46:57] I said, "Sister Connie, where are you?"
[46:59] She said, "I'm just between hospitals.
[47:01] I've just left my son. I'm going to my
[47:04] husband."
[47:05] I said, "Sister Connie," I said, "We're
[47:07] so burdened for you. I'm personally
[47:09] burdened for you. You don't have your
[47:11] husband, your head, or your home. You
[47:13] don't have your son,
[47:15] and you don't know what the future is."
[47:18] I said, "I'm calling to encourage you."
[47:21] And I said, "We've just bought a camp
[47:22] and something just came over." I was
[47:23] sitting in my chair in my study. I said,
[47:26] "I understand from the medical medical
[47:29] people that the last thing that leaves a
[47:30] person is their hearing." And I said,
[47:33] "Though you, though, though you cannot
[47:35] communicate with Brother Ron," I said,
[47:38] "I want you to go into his room. I want
[47:40] you to speak into his ear. I want you to
[47:43] tell him these words that we have just
[47:45] purchased a camp and he's going to
[47:47] preach the camp meetings next year.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; And she went in. You know what his dad
[47:52] said? I didn't want to say this. His dad
[47:55] met me and said, "Brother Biscoll, you
[47:58] prophesied.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; A true prophecy."
[48:02] &gt;&gt; When my son was laying there, that was
[48:04] the first words he said. And so he's
[48:06] coming also. And his wife's never been
[48:08] on an airplane. I believe we're in for a
[48:10] great time, friend. And why am I saying
[48:12] this? Because to put you in expectation.
[48:15] We're not going to go humrum along.
[48:17] We're going in there with prayer. We're
[48:19] going with expectation in a God that
[48:22] does the impossible. Hallelujah. For
[48:24] lives that have been entrenched maybe in
[48:27] sin and young people that have never
[48:29] been touched. And and not only young
[48:31] people only. This isn't a youth camp.
[48:33] This is a family camp. This for mom and
[48:35] dad, grandpa, grandma. I don't care how
[48:37] old you are. This is to move you as
[48:39] well.
[48:40] Hallelujah.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Well, I better get
[48:45] preaching before I get preaching.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Turn in your Bible, please, to Genesis.
[48:52] I'm glad that God has distributed
[48:54] something to us
[48:56] &gt;&gt; that we can distribute to others. I'm
[48:58] reading the same scriptures we read last
[49:00] week and just going from there quickly.
[49:03] I wish to preach on my life is preserved
[49:05] part two
[49:07] chapter 32 of Genesis
[49:12] reading Jacob's experience
[49:15] where he wrestled with the angel our
[49:17] scripture reading is starting with verse
[49:19] 24 just a few verses
[49:23] and Jacob was left alone
[49:26] and there wrestled a man with him until
[49:28] the breaking of the day and when he saw
[49:31] that he prevailed not against him and he
[49:34] touched the hollow of his thigh and the
[49:37] hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint
[49:40] as he wrestled with him and he said let
[49:43] me go for the day breakth and he said I
[49:45] will not let thee go except thou bless
[49:47] me and he said unto him what is thy name
[49:52] and he said Jacob and he said thy name
[49:54] shall be called no more Jacob but Israel
[49:58] for as a prince hast thou power with God
[50:02] and with men and hast prevailed. And
[50:05] Jacob asked him and said, Tell me, I
[50:08] pray thee thy name. And he said,
[50:10] Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after
[50:14] my name? And he blessed him there. And
[50:16] Jacob called the name of the place
[50:18] Penuel. Uh for I have g I have seen God
[50:23] face to face, and my life is preserved.
[50:28] And as he passed over Panuel,
[50:30] the sun rose upon him, and he halted
[50:34] upon his thigh. Therefore the children
[50:36] of Israel eat not of the senue which
[50:39] shrank uh which is upon the hollow of
[50:41] the thigh until this day because he
[50:45] touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in
[50:47] the senue that shrank. Amen. God bless
[50:50] you as you have your seats. Thank you
[50:52] for standing patiently.
[51:00] I spoke last Sunday uh my life is
[51:03] preserved
[51:05] and Jacob said I have seen God face to
[51:09] face and my life is preserved.
[51:14] We do not have
[51:17] uh Jacob's set of circumstances.
[51:21] uh we have not experienced what Jacob
[51:24] has experienced.
[51:26] And so we might ask
[51:29] uh what is it that we need to be
[51:33] preserved from?
[51:35] And how do we see God?
[51:39] How do we see God? How do we see God
[51:41] face to face? Or is it possible to see
[51:44] God face to face? The scripture says,
[51:45] "No man has seen God." And so these are
[51:48] very interesting things that no man has
[51:50] seen God. The scripture says and and
[51:53] then God spoke to Moses also and said
[51:56] you can't see my face. And here we have
[51:58] Jacob said I've seen God face to face.
[52:00] And so there has to be you know some
[52:03] continuity in the scripture because we
[52:06] know that there is no uh the the
[52:09] scripture doesn't contradict itself.
[52:11] There's no contradiction in the
[52:12] scripture. So although we do not have
[52:15] Jacob's set of circum circumstances,
[52:18] yet we more than Jacob need to see God
[52:23] face to face
[52:25] &gt;&gt; because of the time that we live in.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; If seeing God face to face preserved his
[52:32] life,
[52:35] we more than Jacob need to be preserved.
[52:38] We live in the most deceptive of all
[52:41] ages.
[52:42] We live in the most wicked,
[52:46] violent,
[52:48] sinful,
[52:49] terrible
[52:51] conditions that we have. And I don't
[52:53] want you to get necessarily
[52:55] unnecessarily quiet when I when we speak
[52:58] about the day that we're living in. We
[53:00] actually live in that kind of a day. And
[53:03] unless you see God
[53:06] somehow see God, and this what I'm going
[53:08] to be dealing with, your life will not
[53:11] survive
[53:13] this age.
[53:18] How does one see God? The Bible says
[53:21] these scriptures,
[53:24] but evil men, this is the day I want to
[53:26] just describe our day for a moment. Evil
[53:28] men and seducers shall wax
[53:32] worse and worse, deceiving and being
[53:34] deceived.
[53:37] 2 Timothy 3:1
[53:39] this know also
[53:41] that in and I don't think you need to
[53:44] know uh you don't need to be reminded
[53:47] but yet this is the scripture this know
[53:50] also that in the last days perilous
[53:54] times shall come and we have gone into
[53:57] that in depth before which I won't today
[53:59] but the perilous times are fierce times
[54:03] are hard to take times hard to approve
[54:06] approach. They're hard to bear. They're
[54:09] troublesome times. I preached a message
[54:11] on children of troublesome times. And we
[54:14] certainly have troublesome times. We
[54:18] have several uh police officers in this
[54:20] church. And I understand just from my
[54:24] reading that it used to be that they had
[54:26] a they had a a science in criminology.
[54:30] There was a certain science because one
[54:32] of the first things they would look for
[54:34] in a crime is a motive. What is the
[54:37] motive? And the motive might lead them
[54:40] to a certain uh individuals that might
[54:43] have that motive. Today I understand
[54:45] there is no motives.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; People commit just dreadful crimes with
[54:52] no motive whatsoever. young man walking
[54:55] down here in in in in this city called
[54:58] Surrey. Walking down and some fellas
[55:00] walk up from behind and hit him with a
[55:03] hatchet on the neck and sever his spinal
[55:06] cord and he's quadripollegic from the
[55:09] neck down and he's just a young man,
[55:11] athlete, 18 years old. What is the
[55:14] sense? They didn't even know him.
[55:16] There's been no dispute whatsoever. And
[55:19] that man has left that that way for the
[55:21] rest of our our lives. And we don't want
[55:23] to with rest of his life and we don't
[55:25] want to talk about these things but this
[55:26] is this is just a this is isn't even
[55:29] scratching the surface and what you see
[55:32] is very little because you're protected
[55:34] from it.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Your people and your children and your
[55:37] families are protected from it. And we
[55:39] thank God because that's part of the
[55:41] preserving. And I I'm going to get into
[55:43] some of this just a little bit further
[55:45] on. So how do we see is the question.
[55:48] And how are we preserved? Those are two
[55:50] of the key things I want to deal with.
[55:53] Jesus described our day
[55:56] in the in the gospel of uh Luke. And I
[56:00] want you to although these are very very
[56:02] familiar, I want you to listen very
[56:04] closely because I'm laying a foundation
[56:05] here. Jesus said, "As it was
[56:10] in the days of Noah, they did eat, they
[56:14] drank, they married wives, they were
[56:17] given in marriage. And as it was in the
[56:21] days of Lot, they did eat, they drank,
[56:25] they bought, they sold, they planted,
[56:28] they builded." Now, there's nothing
[56:30] wrong with eating and drinking and
[56:32] planting and building and these things.
[56:34] There's nothing sinful about those
[56:36] things. But this was something that the
[56:38] people became utterly consumed with.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; This was their life.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; And sin was rampant. The days of Noah,
[56:48] it was violent. The days of Sodom,
[56:51] perversion. And all of these things
[56:54] wrapped up in this entire scene. What is
[56:57] Jesus doing? Jesus is giving a he's he's
[57:00] drawing a scenario so that they can see
[57:02] it. and and an extremely sinful time. As
[57:05] it will as it was in those days, as it
[57:08] was, so shall it be. Even thus shall it
[57:12] be in the day when the son of man is
[57:16] revealed. So he's given the problem and
[57:19] the solution in the same verse. As it
[57:22] was in those days, so will it be in the
[57:25] day when the son of man is revealed. It
[57:28] is the revealing or the seeing of the
[57:30] son of man that's the antidote for the
[57:32] problem.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; And he's giving that answer. And you
[57:36] have to in in the revelation of the son
[57:39] of man when the son of man which was
[57:40] Christ himself who is the word when he's
[57:43] revealed when he's made known when he's
[57:46] seen
[57:48] &gt;&gt; when you see him you'll have the answer.
[57:51] When you see him you'll have the
[57:53] strength to withstand all the conditions
[57:56] that exist. Amen.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; You follow that
[58:02] &gt;&gt; the revealing of the son of man is the
[58:06] preserving power
[58:10] &gt;&gt; for the atmosphere of today. We have a
[58:14] uh
[58:15] incredible atmosphere. The Bible speaks
[58:18] of corruption and I want to deal with
[58:20] that for a few moments. the corruption.
[58:23] The Bible says that it's in the world
[58:26] through lust and lust is strong desires.
[58:29] A lot of people soon as they hear of
[58:30] lust, they think of just immorality and
[58:33] so on. No, it's not just that. It is
[58:35] that, but it's more than that. And the
[58:37] scripture says, "Whereby are given,"
[58:40] notice now the same theme, "whereby are
[58:43] given unto us exceeding great and
[58:46] precious promises, that by these you
[58:51] might be partakers of the divine nature,
[58:55] having escaped, not that you hope to
[58:57] escape, you having escaped the
[59:00] corruption that is in the world through
[59:03] lust." How do we escape the corruption
[59:06] that is in the world? I think that you
[59:08] agree with me. There is corruption in
[59:11] the world. We have different words
[59:13] today. We use the word of contamination.
[59:16] We use the word of pollution, especially
[59:19] today. Everything's polluted. In the US,
[59:22] you have the EPA because they're
[59:24] concerned about the pollution in the
[59:26] environment and so on and so forth. And
[59:28] you've got all kinds of of of of of
[59:31] departments and governmental agencies
[59:33] and different jurisdictions that are
[59:36] dealing with, you know, the pollution,
[59:38] want to make sure you don't pollute
[59:39] anything. It's just absolutely amazing
[59:42] that the people will be so concerned
[59:44] about that and while they do that, they
[59:46] curse and damn and use God's name in
[59:49] vain. And as far as I'm concerned, it's
[59:51] pollution of the atmosphere.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; It is a pollution. They're contaminating
[59:57] while they're concerned about the earth
[59:59] and about the grass and about the trees
[1:00:01] and about the water and in the meantime
[1:00:03] literally pollute the minds of young
[1:00:06] people around them.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; I want this congregation to be
[1:00:09] supportive today.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; This is your experience.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; You might as well say sick them a few
[1:00:15] times cuz I expect to run the race. I
[1:00:18] want to get a hold of the Satan. Give
[1:00:21] him a hard time today. Amen.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:00:27] great and precious promises, that by
[1:00:30] these you might be the partakers of the
[1:00:33] divine nature,
[1:00:36] having escaped,
[1:00:38] having escaped the corruption. And
[1:00:40] brother Brandham makes a point of this.
[1:00:42] He says, "We look back to the pit. We
[1:00:45] look back to the pit where we were hewed
[1:00:48] from. We're not what we want to be.
[1:00:51] We're not what we ought to be, but one
[1:00:54] thing we're thankful for, we're not what
[1:00:57] we used to be.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen to that? We're not
[1:01:01] what we used to be.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; He says we're not we're not what we used
[1:01:06] to be. We're on the road and we're
[1:01:09] having escaped the corruption of the
[1:01:12] world. Having escaped that, he said the
[1:01:15] lust and corruption of the world, you're
[1:01:19] above that. We've escaped that.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've escaped that. And if
[1:01:25] we've escaped that, we ought to rejoice.
[1:01:27] We ought to rejoice abundantly. We ought
[1:01:30] to have something deep within us that is
[1:01:32] saying, "Thank God, I have escaped it."
[1:01:35] And if we're here living in an area
[1:01:38] still in risk, depending, you better see
[1:01:41] how much risk you want to uh uh you want
[1:01:44] to expose yourself to. And I would say
[1:01:47] for anybody sitting on the fence,
[1:01:49] anybody who's not made their peace with
[1:01:51] God, you cannot afford, neither do you
[1:01:54] have the strength, you don't have the
[1:01:57] skills, you don't have the wisdom, you
[1:01:59] haven't got the smarts to outsmart
[1:02:02] Satan,
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; the corruption that is in the world
[1:02:06] through lust,
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; the world is spending. And I like to
[1:02:12] know just you know I want to just bring
[1:02:13] some personal uh uh
[1:02:18] some personal perspective to you just
[1:02:20] things person lives a long time and you
[1:02:23] see things in a certain way and you that
[1:02:25] are younger than myself. Uh I want you
[1:02:28] just to take this from someone who's
[1:02:30] been down the road. Brother Brandham
[1:02:32] says other people been up the road a
[1:02:34] ahead of him. And I can tell you
[1:02:36] prophets's gone up the road ahead of us
[1:02:38] and made the traveling a whole lot
[1:02:40] easier for us. And I've been up the road
[1:02:43] ahead of a lot of you just to make the
[1:02:45] road a little bit easier. And I hope you
[1:02:47] are able to learn from from some of
[1:02:49] these things. But something that I've
[1:02:51] observed is a and I'm I'm puzzled over.
[1:02:54] I see a real paradox. the the world, our
[1:02:58] government, your government, your
[1:03:00] country, this nation, whether it be
[1:03:02] Europe or United States or Asia or
[1:03:04] wherever, they're spending vast amounts
[1:03:07] of money and resources and human
[1:03:10] resources and energy to cope with the
[1:03:14] consequences, the consequences of the
[1:03:18] ills, the consequences of things without
[1:03:22] actually dealing seriously with the
[1:03:25] cause. Amen.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; World leaders, I've been careful to make
[1:03:31] this note and went over it very
[1:03:33] carefully, so I I don't want to just
[1:03:36] glide over it glibly.
[1:03:39] World leaders and governments
[1:03:43] spend their time and their money and
[1:03:47] energy dealing with the consequences,
[1:03:51] but do not deal with the cause. Perhaps
[1:03:54] because
[1:03:56] It is the continuous efforts that they
[1:03:59] must make and the endless programs in
[1:04:02] attempting to solve the problems that
[1:04:05] justify their job.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; They keep themselves in position. We've
[1:04:12] got case loads and you know I've got to
[1:04:15] deal with this and I've got these kind
[1:04:16] of files etc etc. I've got to this is
[1:04:19] this is the department that I work in
[1:04:22] and the department is working on
[1:04:24] programs and working on uh on on the
[1:04:27] consequences of things. Look at our our
[1:04:30] penal institutions. Look at our social
[1:04:33] services. Look at the poverty and the
[1:04:36] homelessness and constantly trying to
[1:04:39] deal with with things in that line.
[1:04:44] Nations and governments are consumed
[1:04:48] with dealing with crime,
[1:04:52] violence,
[1:04:53] drugs,
[1:04:55] alcoholism,
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; poverty,
[1:04:59] disease, and a host of other crushing
[1:05:03] problems that stem from these some of
[1:05:07] these very elementary uh things which
[1:05:11] invade have invaded uh that are in the
[1:05:13] world who lust. They have a strong
[1:05:16] desire and yet they resist doing
[1:05:19] anything about the cause.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; I I went onto the radio
[1:05:26] onto a talk show some time ago and they
[1:05:29] had the leading people in divorce and
[1:05:33] marriage situations
[1:05:36] on the radio.
[1:05:38] And so I called and they were giving the
[1:05:41] statistics
[1:05:44] of divorce cases the percentages and as
[1:05:48] they related to these percentages near
[1:05:51] to 50%
[1:05:53] and I said
[1:05:55] I'm a I'm a minister and I said I have
[1:05:59] conducted x number of marriages
[1:06:03] and these have these marriages have
[1:06:05] endured for many years and the
[1:06:08] percentage at the time of failed
[1:06:11] marriages that I had conducted was
[1:06:14] around 3%.
[1:06:17] They didn't even want to talk to me.
[1:06:20] And here they're trying to cope with a
[1:06:22] 50% marriage breakups, but they didn't
[1:06:25] want to talk to anybody who had three.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; They don't want to actually deal I would
[1:06:32] think that if anybody wanted to
[1:06:34] seriously deal with their problem,
[1:06:36] they'd say, "What's your secret? Amen.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; What's your secret?
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; And then they say, "Oh, what wonderful
[1:06:46] young people. What wonderful sisters.
[1:06:48] What wonderful ladies. What wonderful
[1:06:50] families." But they never asked the
[1:06:52] second question. What's your secret?
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; The secret is there's a preserving
[1:07:01] power.
[1:07:03] The secret is there's something of
[1:07:06] substance
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; within the word of God
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; and it actually works because we've seen
[1:07:12] him.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; We didn't just get excited. We saw him.
[1:07:18] We see something.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; And what we see is not just a doctrine,
[1:07:22] not just a code of ethics, not just a
[1:07:24] church, not just a way to live, but we
[1:07:27] see him. And we're brought into an
[1:07:29] atmosphere that transforms us.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; For example,
[1:07:40] the cost in human suffering
[1:07:43] and the loss of life. Now, you people
[1:07:45] that come here and sit here in the
[1:07:47] meetings,
[1:07:49] you don't deal with what I deal with.
[1:07:52] So, I want you to take it from me.
[1:07:55] I deal with broken broken lives. I deal
[1:08:00] with people whose lives have been
[1:08:02] shattered. And that is why if it's
[1:08:05] possible to have a a a I I detest what
[1:08:10] Satan does to lives, not even
[1:08:12] Christians, but just people. That's
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; right. I think it's it's it's it's just
[1:08:19] beyond words to see the suffering that
[1:08:22] there is, the human suffering. And they
[1:08:24] show you pictures and and uh of starving
[1:08:28] people and and the children and the
[1:08:30] battle and the the the suffering and the
[1:08:32] genocide that takes place in Dar and Dar
[1:08:36] and other places of the world and the
[1:08:38] starving that happened in Ethiopia and
[1:08:40] whatever more. and and you you sit here
[1:08:43] and you feel what can you do? You're
[1:08:45] just a such a such an infatismal uh you
[1:08:49] know piece of dust in amongst the
[1:08:51] humanity of six billion. What can you
[1:08:53] do? And even if you try to make a real
[1:08:55] valiant effort as many of you know years
[1:08:58] ago I had some men in the church and
[1:09:01] they said we'll buy $50,000 worth of
[1:09:04] rice. I called a member of parliament
[1:09:06] from the government of British
[1:09:07] government of Canada the federal
[1:09:09] government. sat down, had lunch with him
[1:09:11] over here in Langley. And I called him
[1:09:13] by name. We were good friends. He'd been
[1:09:15] in our church several times. I said to
[1:09:17] him, Bob, I said, "We want to send
[1:09:19] $50,000 in rice. It's not going to cost
[1:09:22] the government anything. We don't want
[1:09:24] you to do anything just to open up the
[1:09:26] channel for us. All we want to do,
[1:09:28] there's only one request. We'll pay all
[1:09:31] the charges, buy the rice, pay the
[1:09:33] shipping, everything's paid. The
[1:09:35] government has no responsibility
[1:09:37] whatsoever. Only thing we want to do, we
[1:09:40] want to send one person of our
[1:09:43] congregation to go there when it arrives
[1:09:46] and to see that it goes to the starving
[1:09:49] people.
[1:09:51] You know what his answer was?
[1:09:56] That'd be very, very difficult.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; They don't have to pay an airfare.
[1:10:04] They don't have to do anything. They
[1:10:05] don't have to pay a penny. and we want
[1:10:08] to give $50,000 worth of rice to
[1:10:12] starving. All we want to do is see that
[1:10:14] it gets to their mouth.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; And here we got a member of parliament
[1:10:19] of our government telling me it'd be
[1:10:21] very, very difficult. And you know what?
[1:10:25] We failed.
[1:10:28] Our government wasn't able to do it.
[1:10:32] And so
[1:10:35] however many mouths we might have been
[1:10:37] able to feed, I call our government to
[1:10:40] be responsible for it.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; We had it in our heart. We wanted to do
[1:10:45] it.
[1:10:51] How many today
[1:10:53] I'm just quite frankly I hope you're
[1:10:56] ready because I'm laying a long
[1:10:57] foundation. Amen.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; How many today are laying in our
[1:11:02] hospitals
[1:11:04] and the with the suffering that cannot
[1:11:06] be described?
[1:11:09] What cost
[1:11:11] to society?
[1:11:13] How many are in prisons today?
[1:11:17] How many are fatherless? And how many
[1:11:19] women are without their husbands and
[1:11:21] husbands without their wives
[1:11:24] because of the liquor industry?
[1:11:29] just because of the liquor industry. I
[1:11:31] just drew one to as an example.
[1:11:34] How many what is the cost? And yet will
[1:11:37] they do anything about that?
[1:11:40] Not a chance.
[1:11:42] Do you know why? Because there's huge
[1:11:46] amount of money that come in to support
[1:11:48] the job that they need to do to deal
[1:11:50] with the consequences.
[1:11:52] Does it make any sense or am I, you
[1:11:54] know, am I just down the creek
[1:11:55] someplace?
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "Brother," and
[1:12:04] brother, he said, "We've got a great
[1:12:06] nation.
[1:12:08] We've been a great people. We've been a
[1:12:11] great church. We've been a great
[1:12:14] everything, but I tell you, everything I
[1:12:17] tell you, everything mortal has got to
[1:12:20] give way." And the time is at hand. And
[1:12:23] I will tell you that everything is
[1:12:25] laying in it. And the world has become
[1:12:28] one great chaos of corruption and stink
[1:12:32] before God.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Those are strong words, but I say amen
[1:12:35] to them.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; He says, "And this nation, it's whiskey,
[1:12:40] it's drinking, beer drinking, and our
[1:12:43] taxes has paid on this whiskey and stuff
[1:12:47] which supports our nation and its blood
[1:12:50] money.
[1:12:56] Will they do anything about the alcohol
[1:12:58] system? No, won't do anything about it.
[1:13:05] This is from the American Academy of
[1:13:08] Pediatrics media violence policy
[1:13:11] statement from 2001
[1:13:15] and it states this.
[1:13:18] The strength the strength of the
[1:13:20] correlation
[1:13:22] between media violence
[1:13:26] and aggressive behavior is greater than
[1:13:29] the correlation between calcium intake
[1:13:32] and the and and the bone mass. So those
[1:13:36] of you that take, you know, calcium,
[1:13:39] let me just say to you that the
[1:13:41] correlation, the connection between
[1:13:44] media violence
[1:13:47] and aggressive behavior is more
[1:13:50] accurate, more substantial than the
[1:13:54] intake of vitamins into your body. and
[1:13:56] the correlation between lead in
[1:13:59] ingestation or ingestion and a lower IQ.
[1:14:03] You know, here just a few months ago or
[1:14:05] just within the last year or so,
[1:14:08] all through North America, United States
[1:14:10] and Canada, they found some lead in the
[1:14:13] paint on toys that were manufactured in
[1:14:17] China.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; You know what happened?
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; They shut it down and recalled it all.
[1:14:23] Yeah,
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; governments had to change. China had to
[1:14:26] change. They all had to because they
[1:14:28] couldn't sell a one of them. They they
[1:14:30] they they cut it off at the wellhead.
[1:14:32] They cut the problem off right there.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; But when it comes to something that is
[1:14:38] even more substantial,
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; which is the aggressive and the violence
[1:14:43] that is in the world and the scripture
[1:14:44] says it will be that way. I'm not
[1:14:46] preaching that it can be changed, but
[1:14:48] I'm preaching that the scripture is
[1:14:50] absolutely true. And the scripture has
[1:14:53] not left the believer without a without
[1:14:56] an attitude,
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; without a without an injection.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; And they say that they they withdrew all
[1:15:10] of those toys over Walmart, all these
[1:15:13] big they don't care what it cost. Pull
[1:15:14] them off. You cannot sell them. And they
[1:15:17] changed it right away. But when it come
[1:15:19] to violence on the television, violence
[1:15:23] in the media, in the magazines, whatever
[1:15:26] more do absolutely nothing about that
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; and that's the one that's actually
[1:15:33] really creating the situations that we
[1:15:36] have. And this is uh on July 26, 2000.
[1:15:40] Listen to this closely.
[1:15:42] The American Health Association,
[1:15:45] the American Academy of Pediatrics, the
[1:15:48] American Psychological Association, the
[1:15:51] American Psychiatric Association, the
[1:15:54] American Academy of Family Physicians,
[1:15:57] the American Academy of Child and
[1:16:00] Adolescent Psychiatry
[1:16:02] signed a joint statement on the impact
[1:16:05] of entertainment violence on the
[1:16:08] children, stating that viewing
[1:16:11] entertainment ment violence can lead to
[1:16:14] increase in aggressive attitudes, values
[1:16:17] and behavior particularly in children.
[1:16:20] Its effects are measurable. This is not
[1:16:24] something that's you know maybe it's
[1:16:26] there. The effects are measurable.
[1:16:30] Moreover, prolonged viewing of media
[1:16:34] violence can lead to emotional
[1:16:37] desensitization
[1:16:38] toward violence in real life. Children
[1:16:41] who see a lot of violence are more
[1:16:44] likely to view violence as an
[1:16:46] ineffective way of settling conflicts.
[1:16:49] And children exposed to violence are
[1:16:52] more likely to assume that the acts of
[1:16:54] violence are acceptable behavior. The
[1:16:57] impact of violent interactive
[1:16:59] entertainment such as video games on
[1:17:02] young people indicate that the negative
[1:17:05] impact may be significantly listen
[1:17:08] significantly more
[1:17:11] more severe than that rot by television,
[1:17:16] movies or music.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; That's the direction and and and this
[1:17:22] video games.
[1:17:25] Now, if you make a practice of watching
[1:17:28] them, I would say you ought to stop.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; And that's not just a preacher telling
[1:17:33] you. Here's all of thesemies and all of
[1:17:36] these institutions and all of these
[1:17:38] people's of authority who've said it is
[1:17:40] measurable
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; and it is having a serious effect. And
[1:17:46] if you think, oh, I go to Cloverdale
[1:17:48] Bible way or I believe in a prophet,
[1:17:50] that doesn't mean nothing. Amen.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; You're not going to escape. You can only
[1:17:55] escape it by somehow seeing God face to
[1:17:59] face.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; See, I'm talking about the problem now.
[1:18:02] And that's not too exciting. I'm talking
[1:18:04] about the the the real world that we
[1:18:06] live in. That's not too exciting. I have
[1:18:09] seen too many people who think I got
[1:18:11] control of things. I got a I got a
[1:18:13] control of my life and I I can handle
[1:18:15] it. You can't handle it. There isn't a
[1:18:18] person smart enough to handle it. Not a
[1:18:20] person strong enough within their own
[1:18:22] self strong enough. You can't outsmart
[1:18:25] the devil. Not a chance.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; You can't play with it and get away with
[1:18:30] it.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; You might remember that. You can't play
[1:18:36] with it and get away with it.
[1:18:47] I've got a whole a whole bunch here that
[1:18:50] I'm I'm going to bypass because I don't
[1:18:52] want to take all my time with it.
[1:18:56] But they've said that the the violence
[1:19:01] the violence on television
[1:19:04] is just
[1:19:06] unspeakable.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; The violence that they show, even
[1:19:11] newspapers, I don't get a newspaper to
[1:19:13] my home. There's so much violence.
[1:19:16] There's so much sex that's put forward
[1:19:19] and they're appealing to all of this.
[1:19:22] What am I saying? I'll say this in a few
[1:19:24] words. I want I want to I I do want to
[1:19:27] belabor this point. We're living in a
[1:19:30] world that Jesus described.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; We're living in a world that Paul
[1:19:36] described the first church age as
[1:19:38] messenger. But we happen to be those on
[1:19:41] whom the ends of the world have come.
[1:19:43] Amen.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; And this atmosphere permeates somehow
[1:19:50] creeps in the cracks of our home, our
[1:19:53] lives, our workplace, wherever you are.
[1:19:56] There's you can't seal it off
[1:19:58] successfully enough. So what is the
[1:20:00] answer? The answer is to have an
[1:20:03] antidote
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; for the problem.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; You're going to hear the cursing. You're
[1:20:11] going to hear those things. You're going
[1:20:13] to see those things as much as you try
[1:20:16] to seal it off. It's going to creep in.
[1:20:18] It's somehow going to cre permeate the
[1:20:21] life of the home, whatever more. But it
[1:20:23] doesn't have to have control of it.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham asked a question
[1:20:34] in the handwriting on the wall. He said,
[1:20:37] 'What do you think
[1:20:40] them Hollywood prostitutes in hell today
[1:20:45] would do if they could return?
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; They'd make it different. But the
[1:20:53] influence upon the world has set the
[1:20:56] world in a flame of corruption.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; I'll leave it with you. What do you
[1:21:01] think the prostitutes of Hollywood who
[1:21:03] are in hell today if they could return
[1:21:06] and come back? What do you think they
[1:21:09] would tell the people on the street?
[1:21:11] What do you think they would tell even
[1:21:13] this congregation if they could have
[1:21:14] access to it, which they wouldn't? What
[1:21:17] would they say? I tell you, they would
[1:21:19] do exactly like the rich man who went
[1:21:22] there. He said he would try to warn all
[1:21:24] of his brothers. People try to warn
[1:21:26] everybody, don't come to this place.
[1:21:29] Do everything you can. Listen, friends,
[1:21:31] you're not having a second chance. There
[1:21:33] is no second chance. This is our chance.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; This is our This is our vapor of life.
[1:21:38] As I prayed with the brothers in the in
[1:21:41] the study this morning, I was uh and the
[1:21:43] Holy Spirit just came upon me and I I
[1:21:46] was uh uh uh moved by the statement,
[1:21:49] what is your life? It's even as a vapor.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; But even in this little vapor, you have
[1:21:54] this opportunity.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; You're all here. Every one of you have
[1:21:57] your own personal little vapor. And God
[1:22:00] has given you the opportunity to be here
[1:22:02] under the sound of the gospel of Jesus
[1:22:05] Christ in this little time of vapor.
[1:22:07] He's allowed you to hear the message of
[1:22:09] the hour.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; A preserving message.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Not just a preserving doctrine, a
[1:22:16] preserving message. I'm going to tell
[1:22:18] you some things about the message today
[1:22:19] that I think will maybe be a surprise to
[1:22:22] you. There's a there's an element in the
[1:22:25] message. There's an element in the word
[1:22:29] that God has sent
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; that will actually create an atmosphere
[1:22:35] if you allow it to.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; It can just be a book or it can just be
[1:22:38] a tape and that's all it may be to you.
[1:22:41] But I want to tell you as a brother that
[1:22:43] has found a lot more than that.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; A lot more than that. There's an
[1:22:47] atmosphere.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; There's a person. There's a person
[1:22:52] behind the words. And that person begins
[1:22:55] to make himself known as he senses the
[1:22:58] love, as he senses the devotion, as he
[1:23:01] senses the hunger, as he senses the
[1:23:03] thirst. Then he comes and makes himself
[1:23:06] known. He comes out of the pages of the
[1:23:08] book.
[1:23:11] begins to create an event, a situation
[1:23:16] that when you walk away, you know that
[1:23:19] you've communed with a person.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us that Jacob wrestled
[1:23:27] with a man. I don't know what that was.
[1:23:30] And I don't know how that was.
[1:23:33] It doesn't say anything more about the
[1:23:35] man, an angel, where he came, where he
[1:23:38] went. It doesn't describe for us how
[1:23:42] Jacob felt about that he wrestled with a
[1:23:44] man and he's uh it's rather strange
[1:23:50] because there had to be some kind of
[1:23:52] atmosphere with his experience because
[1:23:55] he said this is none other than the
[1:23:58] house of God.
[1:24:01] I have met God face to face when
[1:24:04] actually in fact he had just wrestled
[1:24:06] with a man. So now there was something
[1:24:08] more than just wrestling with a man.
[1:24:11] There was something more than just
[1:24:12] having his his hip halted so that he
[1:24:15] limp from then on as a prince with God.
[1:24:17] He had an experience that actually
[1:24:20] transformed him into another kind of
[1:24:22] man.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; He w he came into that experience one
[1:24:26] man and walked out another man.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Totally transformed. What was it that
[1:24:32] transformed him? Not just a wrestling
[1:24:34] match. It was an atmosphere of holiness
[1:24:37] of God. He knew when he was done, he met
[1:24:40] God.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; I've met God face to face and my life is
[1:24:49] preserved.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; In this hour
[1:24:57] of corruption, that God draws himself
[1:25:02] a bride out of this corruption. And I
[1:25:04] want you to listen closely to this
[1:25:06] quote. And listen now. I I want to lift
[1:25:10] it above a quote.
[1:25:12] I want you to hear it as words that is
[1:25:15] coming to the elect of God. And it
[1:25:20] depends how you receive it. He said it's
[1:25:23] too bad that things of the world has so
[1:25:26] captured the church in these days. And
[1:25:30] Satan had a rude way of doing it to
[1:25:33] bringing in the television right into
[1:25:36] the homes and things and corrupting the
[1:25:39] minds of the people. Can you say amen to
[1:25:42] that?
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; But people have a desire. They had a
[1:25:47] desire. They had a strong desire for
[1:25:50] entertainment and still do of course
[1:25:52] have a strong desire towards maybe
[1:25:55] sports or strong desire to just
[1:25:58] socialize and be out with the crowd or
[1:26:01] whatever more strong desire to feel
[1:26:03] good. So we have some some drinks and
[1:26:05] some alcohol and whatever more. So there
[1:26:08] because of a strong desire, not
[1:26:10] necessarily your desire only, may not be
[1:26:14] your desire at all, but because of a
[1:26:15] strong desire, because of lust in the
[1:26:18] world, but the the the the scripture
[1:26:20] says that corruption comes into the
[1:26:23] world through that channel, through
[1:26:27] lust. It comes in because people have
[1:26:29] desired a certain thing and you're
[1:26:31] working with the people that desire
[1:26:33] that. You shop with the people that
[1:26:36] desire that. That is why it's
[1:26:37] everywhere. That's why it's on the
[1:26:39] bookstand. That's why it's absolutely
[1:26:41] everywhere. You cannot escape it, but
[1:26:43] you can have a preservation. You can
[1:26:46] have a be preserved against it.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; You can't escape seeing it. You can't
[1:26:51] escape hearing it, but you can escape
[1:26:54] the effect of it. Amen.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say, corrupting the
[1:27:02] minds of people until today, he said, a
[1:27:05] great percent of the church that call
[1:27:07] themselves Christian will stay from
[1:27:09] home, stay home from prayer meeting on a
[1:27:13] Wednesday night to get to see some
[1:27:15] favorite program or somebody from
[1:27:17] Hollywood or somewhere. And that oughten
[1:27:20] to even be put out on the screen. maybe
[1:27:23] living with three or four husbands or
[1:27:26] wives and carrying on and living all
[1:27:28] kinds of lives and go on drunk parties
[1:27:31] and smoking and lying and everything
[1:27:33] that can be done that's wrong. What is
[1:27:36] he talking about? He's talking about a
[1:27:37] scenario. He's talking about a scene, a
[1:27:39] reality.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; This isn't just a qu. This is a reality.
[1:27:44] This is what it is. He says, "And our
[1:27:47] churches are fashioning themselves." He
[1:27:50] breaks. Even our dress in this day
[1:27:53] becomes after Hollywood. What a pity
[1:27:56] it's got to be. I say to our young
[1:27:59] ladies, our m our ladies and our men
[1:28:02] before I would change
[1:28:04] according to the fashion of the world, I
[1:28:06] think it'd be a good thing to for you to
[1:28:08] ask where'd that come from?
[1:28:15] Amen.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; I'm going to speak and preach slow
[1:28:23] because I want it to sink in. I could be
[1:28:26] preaching, but I want it to sink in.
[1:28:28] Where do these things come from? Where
[1:28:31] does this new style come from?
[1:28:39] Our churches are fashioning themselves
[1:28:41] after Hollywood. He says, 'What a pity
[1:28:43] it's got to be that our minds, he said,
[1:28:45] think, can't stay pure and holy with
[1:28:48] Christ. It's done something to the
[1:28:50] church. It's crippled it, and it's done
[1:28:52] a horrible thing. All of our papers and
[1:28:55] everything just seem to be corrupted.
[1:28:57] But listen, friends, and I want you to
[1:29:00] listen. It's in the hour of corruption
[1:29:07] and that time of corruption that God
[1:29:11] draws himself a bride.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; A bride that comes out of that
[1:29:19] corruption.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; It's in that hour. And he says, and
[1:29:23] that's what he's looking for to get a
[1:29:25] church that's called by his name.
[1:29:28] Somebody that looks for a life that has
[1:29:31] no end.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; James said in this scripture, James
[1:29:40] 1:25, "But who so lookth into the
[1:29:43] perfect law of liberty, and contin,
[1:29:49] he being not a forgetful hearer, but a
[1:29:51] doer of the word, this man shall be
[1:29:54] blessed in his deed."
[1:29:57] It's kind of a conclusion I want to come
[1:29:59] to. Now I want to build on uh on the
[1:30:02] other aspect of what we see. The
[1:30:06] conclusion is that what we look at
[1:30:10] changes
[1:30:12] your attitudes
[1:30:15] changes the way we act. Amen.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; If you stay around a negative person,
[1:30:23] I'll just take it this way,
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; and just hear negative things,
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; you will be affected by that
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; because there are seeds that are sewn in
[1:30:32] your mind. If you just hear positive
[1:30:35] things, that's fine. You'll be affected
[1:30:36] that way. But if you hear spiritual
[1:30:39] things
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; and the power of the word is a power to
[1:30:43] wash
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; it actually it's not something that you
[1:30:48] have to do. If you listen to the word it
[1:30:51] will wash
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; it will wash you. It will wash your
[1:30:54] mind.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:31:01] I want to just take the direction of
[1:31:02] seeing God for a few moments. And
[1:31:04] listen, this is I I wish I could spend
[1:31:07] much more time than perhaps I have
[1:31:08] today. I'll tell you why. Because I know
[1:31:11] deep within me, I wish I could get it
[1:31:13] across to you. And I pray that God will
[1:31:15] help me
[1:31:17] seeing him.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Is the only
[1:31:22] way of escape.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; That's the only way. Listen, I don't
[1:31:27] want to I don't want to dilute or
[1:31:29] diminish your confidence in a church,
[1:31:32] but I can tell you that the church can't
[1:31:35] do it.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; I don't want to diminish your confidence
[1:31:39] in people or your parents or someone
[1:31:41] else. I don't want to diminish your
[1:31:43] confidence in them because people will
[1:31:46] fail at some point along the line.
[1:31:50] A man, a woman, a family can fail and
[1:31:54] and and people become disappointed.
[1:31:57] But there's one thing that will never
[1:31:58] disappoint you and that is a word that
[1:32:01] God has sent and vindicated.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Seeing God
[1:32:11] uh this happened to be in my hometown.
[1:32:14] my sister and her husband were in the
[1:32:16] same meeting and brother Brandon
[1:32:18] preached show us the father
[1:32:23] and he said there now he said I'd like
[1:32:25] to ask this afternoon
[1:32:27] would you like to see God that was his
[1:32:30] question would you like to see God would
[1:32:33] you like to really see this one that
[1:32:36] we're talking about could he be seen and
[1:32:40] he goes on to speak says but I'm I'm
[1:32:43] going to show four different ways that
[1:32:46] he that we can see God. God in his
[1:32:49] universe,
[1:32:50] God in his word, God in his son, and God
[1:32:55] in his people.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; He says, "And maybe by that we will be
[1:33:01] able to find what God is,
[1:33:04] where he is. Is he gone on?
[1:33:08] Was he something that once lived and now
[1:33:10] has passed away?" He said, "No, sir." He
[1:33:13] said, "I will never leave thee, nor
[1:33:15] forsake thee. Lo, I am with you always
[1:33:17] to the end of the world." He quotes the
[1:33:18] scripture. "And yet a little while in
[1:33:20] the world," notice, "Yet a little
[1:33:22] while," he's still quoting scripture.
[1:33:24] Yet a little while in the world seeth me
[1:33:27] no more,
[1:33:30] but
[1:33:32] you will see me.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; And because I live, you will live also.
[1:33:41] and I'll be with you and even in you to
[1:33:45] the end of the world.
[1:33:53] Now, here's something I want to bring
[1:33:55] you to, and I'm I'm going to ask that
[1:33:57] God will give you a very very special
[1:34:01] insight
[1:34:03] because I've been really uh struggling
[1:34:06] with how to bring this exactly to you.
[1:34:09] And I'm going to use a word that is not
[1:34:11] commonly used
[1:34:13] and it's it's close to a word that can
[1:34:15] be mis misinterpreted.
[1:34:18] But God creates situations and I'm
[1:34:23] holding myself back. So you just help
[1:34:24] me. God creates situations
[1:34:29] uh and conditions. He creates a
[1:34:32] situation and a condition
[1:34:34] through which we can encounter him can
[1:34:38] encounter God.
[1:34:40] Uh the whole event brings us face to
[1:34:45] face with God.
[1:34:47] The circumstances of Jacob where
[1:34:51] he was running from his brother. He was
[1:34:53] he had a a a a mixture taking place. He
[1:34:57] was fearful.
[1:35:00] uh he had been done wrong by by his
[1:35:03] father-in-law. He had his families. He
[1:35:05] had his responsibility. He had all of
[1:35:07] these things. And now because of the
[1:35:10] circumstances that were there and he's
[1:35:11] sending him away as I described last
[1:35:14] week and the Bible says with our opening
[1:35:16] scripture and Jacob's left alone. That
[1:35:18] was an important part of this of the of
[1:35:22] the scene. He's left alone and he's got
[1:35:25] all of this
[1:35:28] mixture of feelings and emotions and is
[1:35:30] highly charged and in that state he
[1:35:35] uh he meets a man and he wrestles with
[1:35:37] him.
[1:35:39] I had a different set of circumstances.
[1:35:45] I was a young man,
[1:35:47] 27,
[1:35:51] and I was having a big big struggle to
[1:35:54] feed my family,
[1:35:56] desiring to give my life to take the
[1:35:58] gospel to the native Indian people.
[1:36:02] And somehow
[1:36:05] I I I find myself with this prophet of
[1:36:09] God
[1:36:11] in the car
[1:36:17] and I get faced with a question that I
[1:36:20] felt completely incompetent to answer.
[1:36:25] Brother Eddie,
[1:36:27] what do you think of this ministry?
[1:36:30] Do you think it could be that of Elijah
[1:36:31] the prophet as it's foretold in the
[1:36:34] scripture and in Revelation and his
[1:36:37] voice trailed off
[1:36:42] and I I'm just feeling completely
[1:36:45] inadequate. Just completely inadequate.
[1:36:51] Brother Brandham, I'm shaking my head. I
[1:36:53] remember it like it was five minutes
[1:36:54] ago. Brother Brandham,
[1:36:58] for all I know,
[1:37:00] it must be because it has every
[1:37:03] appearance of being. And I kind of
[1:37:06] glanced at him like this
[1:37:10] and had that little flat cowboy hat on.
[1:37:15] He said, "Often kind of wondered.
[1:37:18] I kind of think so myself."
[1:37:21] At that moment, at that moment,
[1:37:24] friends, a being,
[1:37:30] a being
[1:37:33] came instantly into that vehicle,
[1:37:38] froze me. I can feel some of it even
[1:37:41] now. Right between us and just forward.
[1:37:47] And I told the Lord this morning in
[1:37:48] prayer,
[1:37:50] I understand a wee bit
[1:37:53] what Apostle John must have felt when he
[1:37:55] said, "When I saw him, I fell at his
[1:37:58] feet as dead."
[1:38:01] I was absolutely certain and all these
[1:38:05] thoughts flashed through my mind. My
[1:38:07] next breath is taking me out of this
[1:38:10] life.
[1:38:11] That was the first thing that came to my
[1:38:13] mind. And the second one, what what is
[1:38:17] brother Brandham? What is he doing? And
[1:38:21] I couldn't hardly move. I was I was so
[1:38:23] frozen. And I I looked this way
[1:38:26] sideways, cast my eyes to him, and I saw
[1:38:30] his face had lost his color. And we had
[1:38:34] several days of beard because we had
[1:38:36] been out hunting. And his beard stood
[1:38:40] out just in prickles.
[1:38:43] And I'd seen one other man like that
[1:38:44] that had been right at the edge of
[1:38:46] death. And and the thought came through
[1:38:49] my mind. He looks like a man that's
[1:38:51] right near death.
[1:38:54] And he just slowly
[1:38:56] turned his head like this. He's still
[1:38:59] driving. And he cast his eyes sideways
[1:39:02] and looks at me through those deep
[1:39:05] deep set eyes.
[1:39:08] said, 'Brother Eddie,
[1:39:10] I guess he's come to me 10,000 times
[1:39:13] 10,000
[1:39:15] and it's every time the same.
[1:39:18] It's just like I could die.
[1:39:22] It just what had gone through my mind.
[1:39:25] And at that moment, this big moose stood
[1:39:28] on the road and I needed it. And you
[1:39:31] know the rest of the story. But this
[1:39:32] morning, that all came back.
[1:39:37] And I hope you don't think that I've
[1:39:38] gone over the edge,
[1:39:41] but for the first time I said
[1:39:44] I can say I saw God face to face.
[1:39:51] Said, "Did you see anything with your
[1:39:53] eyes?" No.
[1:39:56] Far more accurate than my eyes. Far
[1:39:59] sharper than my eyes. I could even tell
[1:40:01] you exactly where the being was. It
[1:40:04] wasn't what you saw with your eyes. is
[1:40:06] what penetrated
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; my being
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; and I can never change that. I can tell
[1:40:13] it the same every time because it's
[1:40:14] exactly the truth, exactly what
[1:40:17] happened. And I can tell you it was him.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; I can tell you it's a pillar of fire.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; I can tell you it's none other than the
[1:40:24] Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; the resurrected one that was there.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; But the circumstances, I never created
[1:40:32] the situation. Jacob never created the
[1:40:34] situation. You maybe never create the
[1:40:36] situation. Life has its certain kinds of
[1:40:39] circumstances that happen in your life.
[1:40:42] But I can tell you they that hunger and
[1:40:45] thirst after righteousness, they will be
[1:40:47] met by this one.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; And to what degree, I do not know. Maybe
[1:40:53] that perhaps
[1:40:55] was something that I experienced
[1:40:58] and I I it's incumbent upon me to share
[1:41:00] it to you because God is no respector of
[1:41:03] persons.
[1:41:06] He wants to and you have to believe
[1:41:07] this. He wants to meet you.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; If you'll just take the time,
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; if you'll just allow the hunger, listen,
[1:41:16] the world and everything that is taking
[1:41:19] place in your life, I don't have to tell
[1:41:21] you. You don't have to tell me. Your
[1:41:23] life is busy, is it not?
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Your life is busy. Your life is
[1:41:27] occupied. But it's taking away. It's
[1:41:30] taking away from that that time that God
[1:41:34] you have to give some time over to him.
[1:41:36] It just can't it just doesn't happen
[1:41:38] when we're roaring around and racing
[1:41:40] around and we're where our lives are so
[1:41:43] filled with things of the world. And
[1:41:45] that's why the scripture said and I
[1:41:47] majored on it last week looking while we
[1:41:50] look not at the things which are seen.
[1:41:54] this whole life, all of this activity,
[1:41:56] there has to be, we we still have to
[1:41:58] deal with it, but we need to we
[1:42:01] absolutely must, not need, we must turn
[1:42:05] uh at least within our focus and our
[1:42:08] attention, within our being, turn from
[1:42:10] that. So that doesn't have the
[1:42:12] importance anymore.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; It's still there.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; It doesn't have the same realm of
[1:42:18] importance. It is this. The prophet
[1:42:21] said,
[1:42:23] "Abraham," and he's certainly no
[1:42:24] different than any of us here. He had
[1:42:26] certain desires. He said, "Abraham,
[1:42:30] he saw Sarah all wrinkled up and old,
[1:42:34] but he said he didn't look at that and
[1:42:37] he didn't look at the deadness of his
[1:42:38] own body." This is real. It's Abraham
[1:42:41] your father
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; in the faith.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Abraham, he said he looked to the
[1:42:46] unseen. What did he look at? He said he
[1:42:49] looked to the unseen and he saw Isaac
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; in that message looking to the unseen.
[1:42:56] He looked to the unseen and he saw
[1:42:59] Isaac.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; He saw the promise.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; He saw it in a in a substance form.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham spoke about
[1:43:19] seeing God. And I want to take you to
[1:43:22] this little example now.
[1:43:25] And this was in Show us Us another
[1:43:28] service.
[1:43:30] Brother Brandham is up in the mountains.
[1:43:32] This is simple, friends, but it's
[1:43:35] profoundly deep.
[1:43:38] He's up in the mountains and there's a
[1:43:39] storm. This is part of the circumstance
[1:43:41] now. There's a storm. He's out hunting.
[1:43:45] He's out in a storm
[1:43:47] and uh and it was a severe storm and
[1:43:50] after the storm let up, he said, "I got
[1:43:53] out from behind a tree and I stood
[1:43:56] there."
[1:44:00] The reason I'm taking this time is to
[1:44:02] make it so down to earth to bring it
[1:44:06] into your
[1:44:09] into your sphere. This isn't something
[1:44:12] that's way out there untouchable. This
[1:44:14] is something that this congregation and
[1:44:17] I wouldn't be speaking this if God
[1:44:19] didn't have the intent. He wants this
[1:44:22] time with you. He wants to bring you
[1:44:27] into a an experience
[1:44:29] not so that it is uh something that is
[1:44:33] just a good feeling for you. It's more
[1:44:36] than that friends.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about preserving you. Amen.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about preserving
[1:44:46] the life, the home, the individual. This
[1:44:49] is what preserves us.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; I've seen God and I am preserved. And he
[1:44:55] said,
[1:44:57] he said he came out
[1:45:00] and way back in the west, the sun was
[1:45:03] beginning to go across the crevices of
[1:45:05] the rock, peeking through.
[1:45:10] said that great allseeing eye of God
[1:45:13] moving down like that. He says, "And I
[1:45:16] noticed where the evergreens were froze,
[1:45:19] where the rain had been and it formed a
[1:45:22] rainbow across the valley." I'm just
[1:45:26] stopping here. I'm going to ask you
[1:45:30] in case you want something deep. This is
[1:45:33] perhaps deeper than you even realize.
[1:45:37] I'm relating now something that had such
[1:45:40] an effect on the prophet of God. It
[1:45:44] created an atmosphere. It created a
[1:45:47] scenario that brought him into an
[1:45:50] incredible experience.
[1:45:52] And he went on to say, and brother, he
[1:45:55] said, you talk about deep calling to
[1:45:59] deep, not shallow calling to shallow,
[1:46:02] deep calling to deep. And he's referring
[1:46:05] to what was happening right now. The
[1:46:08] deep calling to the deep. He said, "I
[1:46:11] looked at that and I set my rifle
[1:46:14] against a tree and I raised up my hands
[1:46:17] and I said, "Oh, great Jehovah, how
[1:46:19] wonderful. I see the rainbow." He said,
[1:46:22] "Could you see God in the rainbow?"
[1:46:24] Certainly. He said, "God gave that as a
[1:46:28] covenant and he'd no more destroy the
[1:46:30] world with water." He said, "God was in
[1:46:33] the rainbow." Then I seen it in
[1:46:35] Revelations 1 when the rainbow was
[1:46:37] across the throne and where Jesus was
[1:46:40] standing a covenant of God had made with
[1:46:44] the people. Then he went on he says how
[1:46:46] marvelous. I looked at that tears began
[1:46:49] to run down my cheeks. I listened. Now
[1:46:53] I've been with brother Brandham many,
[1:46:54] many days
[1:46:56] and in a lot of different services and
[1:46:59] been in his office, been in his home. We
[1:47:01] ate together.
[1:47:02] I never saw him with tears streaming
[1:47:05] down his face, but now he's in an
[1:47:08] experience where tears are streaming
[1:47:10] down his face. He says, "I listened and
[1:47:13] away over here the elk herd had all got
[1:47:16] scattered during the time of the storm
[1:47:19] and the old males would bugle."
[1:47:21] And he says, "And you could hear them
[1:47:23] bugling one to another."
[1:47:27] Now catch this. My mother's half Indian,
[1:47:32] half Cherokee Indian,
[1:47:34] and there's just enough about me to make
[1:47:38] me love that nature.
[1:47:40] Something down in there calling out my
[1:47:44] conversion didn't even take that out. So
[1:47:47] something within him, and now this is
[1:47:49] critical.
[1:47:52] There had to be something within Jacob.
[1:47:55] There had to be something within you
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; in order for the the I won't just say
[1:48:02] the message. I'm going to talk about the
[1:48:05] essence of the message, the spirit of
[1:48:08] the word, the atmosphere of the word
[1:48:12] that when you heard it, it was
[1:48:14] different. Yeah. I never heard anything
[1:48:16] like this. I never felt this way. I'm so
[1:48:20] moved. I'm so filled with hunger. I'm so
[1:48:24] thirsting. I'm so craving. I I have such
[1:48:28] a desire that even things in your life
[1:48:30] change. Maybe maybe uh goals and and
[1:48:34] things that you thought were so
[1:48:36] important, they begin to change and they
[1:48:39] pale in their importance, they don't
[1:48:41] they don't they don't really make a
[1:48:45] great difference in your life anymore.
[1:48:46] Are you following me? You had, you know,
[1:48:49] you had aspirations and you had goals
[1:48:52] and you had things that you wanted to
[1:48:54] achieve and they seemed so important to
[1:48:56] you. And one day you'll find, you may
[1:49:00] well find, I can't say to everybody, but
[1:49:02] you may well find somebody sitting here
[1:49:04] and you'll find
[1:49:07] it doesn't hold the same attraction for
[1:49:08] me anymore. I had such a desire to
[1:49:12] achieve this and to do this and to
[1:49:15] accomplish something and it doesn't
[1:49:18] hold. It just it just fluttered down and
[1:49:21] you don't have that attraction anymore.
[1:49:23] You might say uh am I just getting too
[1:49:27] old or why why doesn't it have why am I
[1:49:30] not gripped by this anymore? Even as a
[1:49:32] young person, I can tell you as a young
[1:49:34] man, there were things that other young
[1:49:36] men were desiring and it didn't hold the
[1:49:39] attraction for me. You can do this, you
[1:49:41] can be that, you can get here, you can
[1:49:43] achieve this, you're you're wasting your
[1:49:46] time here, you can do that, but it
[1:49:47] didn't hold the attraction. Maybe at one
[1:49:49] time it did. And and you may be here and
[1:49:52] it and somehow that was seemed so
[1:49:54] appealing. That's what seemed so
[1:49:57] necessary. That's what seemed so much
[1:49:59] your your goal in life
[1:50:05] isn't there anymore.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you why. God's dealing with
[1:50:09] you.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; God's speaking to you.
[1:50:19] Maybe there's a Jacob here.
[1:50:23] Maybe there's a young woman or any
[1:50:25] person here
[1:50:27] and you're saying, "Oh, brother, brother
[1:50:29] Ed, you're you're talking about me now.
[1:50:33] You're right here where I live.
[1:50:36] I'm going to give you some advice."
[1:50:39] Number one, first and foremost, that
[1:50:41] comes from the message, comes from the
[1:50:43] scriptures. Get alone.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Just get alone.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Get alone someplace.
[1:50:52] and get out.
[1:50:55] You say, "God,
[1:50:58] I know this is not just me.
[1:51:02] I know this must be you."
[1:51:05] And then I heard it in that service.
[1:51:10] What is it?
[1:51:12] What is it that you wish to say?
[1:51:16] Your servant is listening.
[1:51:18] Your child is listening. Your daughter's
[1:51:20] listening.
[1:51:22] Your son is listening.
[1:51:33] I guarantee you,
[1:51:37] you'll sense you'll sense a presence.
[1:51:40] It's not earthly.
[1:51:42] It's beyond earthly.
[1:51:46] It's another place.
[1:51:52] I said, God,
[1:51:54] you know, I just I just want to convey
[1:51:56] to you so much. I I go back to the
[1:51:59] vindication
[1:52:01] and brother Brandham, you can go to
[1:52:03] these messages. Soon as I go to the
[1:52:04] messages, show us the father. Sir, we
[1:52:07] would see Jesus. I always scroll down to
[1:52:10] the end
[1:52:11] because I know that God is setting up a
[1:52:14] he's setting up a scene. He's setting up
[1:52:16] he's setting the service up. He's
[1:52:17] setting the people up. And he even sets
[1:52:20] a trap up for the unbeliever.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; And you can go to this message and he'll
[1:52:25] come right down to it and he'll say to
[1:52:27] he said to this woman, "Oh, you're very
[1:52:30] nervous." He says it all the time.
[1:52:33] And he says, "You have uh forget was
[1:52:37] some throat problem. you have a problem
[1:52:39] in your throat.
[1:52:43] He said, "Now," he said, "I feel it all
[1:52:45] the time." And he turns the
[1:52:47] congregation.
[1:52:48] Somebody out there said, "I guessed
[1:52:50] that."
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "I didn't guess that." Turns
[1:52:55] back to the woman said, "I I don't know
[1:52:58] what I said to you because it wasn't me.
[1:53:00] It was him."
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. He said, "Uh, and you have
[1:53:06] another thing. You have headaches.
[1:53:10] Who doesn't have headaches?
[1:53:14] You know, God
[1:53:17] in such a
[1:53:23] special way
[1:53:25] sets a sets a trap so an unbeliever can
[1:53:28] disbelieve.
[1:53:30] He actually invites an unbeliever or a
[1:53:33] doubter, go ahead and doubt it.
[1:53:36] And then they already get in that
[1:53:38] atmosphere. They already get in a
[1:53:40] doubtful atmosphere. And then he turns
[1:53:42] around and he says, "Would it help you
[1:53:45] if I tell you who you are
[1:53:49] now?" And begins to tell her, "And
[1:53:51] you've got another thing. You've you're
[1:53:52] praying for two children. One of them's
[1:53:54] got a tumor on the hip.
[1:53:56] Would it help you now if I told you who
[1:53:58] you are?"
[1:54:00] When I get down to that point,
[1:54:04] I say, "That's the one.
[1:54:06] That's the one that I'm speaking to.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; That's the one that's that's the one
[1:54:10] that I'm feeling."
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; The one that could do that. Oh, God.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; I want to be near that one.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; That's the one that knows how to
[1:54:19] preserve you.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; And that's the one you need to see.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; And when you see him, you're going to be
[1:54:25] preserved because the next time you're
[1:54:28] you're just into a message. And let me
[1:54:30] tell you something. When you're reading
[1:54:31] a message,
[1:54:33] you've got you're actually reading a
[1:54:35] preserving power
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; because not you're not just reading some
[1:54:40] words, but you it it it there's a word
[1:54:43] that is called it elicits something.
[1:54:47] There's a certain uh uh a a certain
[1:54:51] atmosphere that's a certain amount of uh
[1:54:53] certain uh scenario God brings certain
[1:54:56] circumstances and and certain atmosphere
[1:54:59] that you're in your situation right now
[1:55:01] wherever you are each one of you have
[1:55:03] your s you mothers you're you know well
[1:55:05] I got my children around me I've got a
[1:55:07] I've got home to make and I've got meals
[1:55:09] to make and I've got a little this
[1:55:11] you're not beyond God being able to meet
[1:55:14] with you in a very special way. I don't
[1:55:17] care what what what your situation is,
[1:55:18] brothers, where you are, where you work.
[1:55:21] I'm trying to bulldoze my way through
[1:55:24] that
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; because all of that has been and all of
[1:55:28] that will continue to be. I'm trying to
[1:55:31] show you a light in the middle of it.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; That what I'm speaking of is not in the
[1:55:36] realm of the impossible. It's a realm of
[1:55:38] the possible.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; It's not the realm of the unreachable.
[1:55:42] It's within your reach. Hallelujah.
[1:55:44] Hallelujah.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; God's not afraid of your situation. He's
[1:55:47] not afraid of your occupation. He's not
[1:55:49] afraid of your profession. He not afraid
[1:55:51] of anything. He not afraid of your
[1:55:53] financial situation. He not afraid of
[1:55:55] anything. He wants to he wants to have
[1:55:57] that special visitation with you. And
[1:55:59] here you'll find even this situation
[1:56:02] here, the prophet of God and the storm
[1:56:03] comes and all the rest of it. And then
[1:56:05] that God will speak to him said, "I come
[1:56:08] and walk with me." Amen.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Isn't that profound?
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Come and walk with me.
[1:56:18] Say, "Oh, I'd like to see some
[1:56:20] incredible miracles. I'd like to have
[1:56:22] some uh incredible revelation." I tell
[1:56:25] you what, you can get no greater
[1:56:27] revelation than find a place where God
[1:56:29] will want you to walk with him.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; A holy God.
[1:56:37] Yes.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Wanting to be with you, wanting to be
[1:56:42] with me.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; You see, there has to be something
[1:56:51] within the individual.
[1:56:53] You come to a service like this, and I'm
[1:56:55] going to be honest. I'm going to be
[1:56:58] honest. It breaks my heart.
[1:57:00] I know that there's people
[1:57:03] I know that there's individuals and they
[1:57:05] come to an atmosphere like this. And I
[1:57:07] know that there's a certain atmosphere.
[1:57:09] I know that some are being very very
[1:57:12] affected.
[1:57:15] And if I were you,
[1:57:18] I might not be here next Sunday. Who
[1:57:20] knows? But I would want to say this. If
[1:57:23] I were you and you're sitting here and
[1:57:26] you say, "Doesn't affect me. I have no
[1:57:29] feeling whatsoever. I have no desire
[1:57:31] whatsoever."
[1:57:34] Do you know what I'd be doing? I'd run
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; down to this altar. I'd pound my fist if
[1:57:41] I need to. Oh God, don't leave me.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Don't leave me at the mercy of these
[1:57:46] elements.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Don't leave me at the mercy of this of
[1:57:50] this of the situation that's in this
[1:57:52] world. A world that's filled with
[1:57:54] violence and according to the messenger,
[1:57:56] insanity.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Is it so?
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Is it so?
[1:58:02] If it makes sense to you, you're in a
[1:58:04] different planet than I am. It's just
[1:58:06] such an insanity. And I don't want to be
[1:58:08] left to the elements. I don't want to be
[1:58:10] left to the conditions. I don't want to
[1:58:13] be left to this world. I say, "Oh God,
[1:58:16] deliver me from that."
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Preserve me from that.
[1:58:28] In case you're real smart, I'm not being
[1:58:32] facitious,
[1:58:34] but in case you got things, I got things
[1:58:36] under my control. I I can handle things.
[1:58:39] Then I'm going to give you an
[1:58:40] invitation. Come to my office
[1:58:45] this next week and I'll give you a few
[1:58:48] problems to solve.
[1:58:52] If you're really smart, I'll give you a
[1:58:55] few problems to solve so it'll be done
[1:58:58] right.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Outside of that, if you don't have that
[1:59:02] kind of an answer, I have an answer.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; And the answer is you can see God.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; You can see God.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; You can see God. You might be able to
[1:59:15] see him in nature. You might be able to
[1:59:17] see him in his people. But above all
[1:59:19] things, you need to see him in his word.
[1:59:22] You need to be able to look into that
[1:59:23] message and have a a a situation, have
[1:59:27] an atmosphere, have something take place
[1:59:29] where you're you're actually spoken to
[1:59:32] by a person.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Not I just read some words in the book,
[1:59:37] but you're spoken to by a person and you
[1:59:39] can feel and you sense him and he's near
[1:59:41] and begins to permeate through your
[1:59:43] being and you look upon it and say, "Oh,
[1:59:45] God."
[1:59:48] It might be that you even look there and
[1:59:50] you have to wrestle with the angel. What
[1:59:52] angel? The angel that actually brought
[1:59:55] the message. The prophet speaks about
[1:59:57] that. Speaks about the message in the
[1:59:59] angel.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not over your head. The
[2:00:05] message is no different from the angel
[2:00:08] that brought the message.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; This is the same person.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; And that's the one you seek to touch.
[2:00:16] Amen.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; That's the one you seek to know. That's
[2:00:18] the one you seek to see. I want to see
[2:00:21] you, Lord.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just read some words or
[2:00:24] read a quote or read a scripture. I want
[2:00:26] to see you behind it.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; I know what it is to read scripture and
[2:00:30] look at the scripture and I I say to
[2:00:32] myself, I know that there's something so
[2:00:34] much more here. And I I feel the effect
[2:00:36] of it. Maybe I have an emotion. Maybe
[2:00:38] tears come to my eyes. It's so
[2:00:40] wonderful. It's so glorious. It's so
[2:00:42] it's so just marvelous the way it's
[2:00:45] spoken
[2:00:47] and come into an atmosphere.
[2:00:51] Friends,
[2:00:55] if you don't get to see him,
[2:00:58] if you don't take my advice this
[2:00:59] morning,
[2:01:01] you're going to drift someplace.
[2:01:06] Someplace along the road you're going to
[2:01:08] drift
[2:01:11] because the preserving power is not
[2:01:14] there.
[2:01:21] See this Bible?
[2:01:24] This Bible is read by almost every
[2:01:26] church in the country.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; It's loved.
[2:01:31] It's memorized.
[2:01:33] But it doesn't sustain the people.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; If just reading the Bible does that,
[2:01:38] then why don't you go and live the same
[2:01:40] life that they live if it's okay? But
[2:01:42] you say, "Well, there's something in my
[2:01:43] soul that says it's not okay.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; I can't live there."
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; I can't live at that standard. So, is it
[2:01:50] just a standard? No, it's not just a
[2:01:52] standard. No, it's not just a code of
[2:01:54] ethics. Has nothing to do with just
[2:01:56] wearing a dress and having your hair
[2:01:58] certain way and and being in a certain
[2:02:00] fashion. Has nothing to do with that. It
[2:02:02] has to do with the fact that a person
[2:02:04] reads, one person reads it doesn't mean
[2:02:06] the next another thing, but they love
[2:02:07] it. They love the literature. They love
[2:02:09] it because they believe it's God's word,
[2:02:11] but the next person reads it and
[2:02:12] actually has a has an encounter with the
[2:02:16] author.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet says, "I I maybe
[2:02:20] can't say it just right, but I know the
[2:02:22] author real well." Amen.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Not might not be able to Greek and
[2:02:26] Hebrew the thing and put it into flowery
[2:02:28] language, but I know the author real
[2:02:31] well.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; That is what you as individuals need to
[2:02:35] come to. Say, "Oh God, I'm coming out of
[2:02:37] this service with one." Whether you
[2:02:39] understand anything I said, I hope that
[2:02:40] when you leave these doors, say,
[2:02:42] "Brother Ed, by the Holy Spirit, it
[2:02:45] created a great desire within me, a
[2:02:47] great thirst in me to have that kind of
[2:02:49] an encounter.
[2:02:52] Amen.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Furthermore, I tell you, it's yours.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; It's for you.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; And God perhaps wants it even more than
[2:03:00] you do.
[2:03:13] They all read this.
[2:03:18] And multitudes, untold multitudes, read
[2:03:20] the message.
[2:03:22] And that doesn't interest me right now.
[2:03:24] How much you read the message or what
[2:03:26] you know about the message. I'd like to
[2:03:28] know what you know about the author.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; I'd like to know when the last time you
[2:03:33] talked with him
[2:03:35] when you actually had an encounter with
[2:03:37] him. It'll do something for you. Do you
[2:03:40] know what it'll do?
[2:03:42] It will not not only transform you,
[2:03:47] it'll preserve you.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're going to go out those doors
[2:03:52] and tomorrow you're going to face you're
[2:03:54] going to face everything that there is
[2:03:55] in the world.
[2:03:59] You young people are going to start
[2:04:00] school and you're going to face
[2:04:02] everything hellish.
[2:04:05] I couldn't describe it accurately enough
[2:04:07] or you'd be depressed.
[2:04:10] But there's even your instructors and
[2:04:12] who knows what's in them. What kind of
[2:04:15] spirit is that?
[2:04:17] What kind of uncleanness will they live?
[2:04:21] Are you following me?
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; And you're going to have them as your
[2:04:23] teachers and instructors. You can't
[2:04:25] change that.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; That's the way it is. That's the way
[2:04:28] it's going to be.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; But you can have had an experience maybe
[2:04:32] on the day before and the Sunday or
[2:04:34] maybe that morning and you've just read
[2:04:37] a little something or you're meditating.
[2:04:41] David said,
[2:04:44] "I pondered
[2:04:46] I meditated.
[2:04:48] I mused. And they all have different
[2:04:51] meaning. I meditated. You know what
[2:04:53] meditate is? They have meditation today
[2:04:56] that just, you know, like the Eastern
[2:04:58] religions, you know, well, we meditate.
[2:05:00] It's all silent. If you look at meditate
[2:05:03] in the in the word, it says it growl.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; I moaned.
[2:05:09] I growled. Oh, God. That's meditating.
[2:05:14] Isn't that strange?
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; That's different than you thought it
[2:05:16] was, isn't it?
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; And then I am mused. I pondered. I
[2:05:21] thought in the night time, what are you
[2:05:23] thinking about your problems? How you
[2:05:25] going to pay a bill? How about thinking
[2:05:27] about meeting this one? I wonder if
[2:05:29] tomorrow will be a special day and I'll
[2:05:32] meet him. I I hope you're not weary with
[2:05:34] my service.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to belabor this
[2:05:37] because this is so important. It means
[2:05:39] more to me to have a congregation of
[2:05:41] people that actually come to church the
[2:05:43] next meeting time say I I met God.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; I read an email just before I got it
[2:05:51] while I was in the study and a woman
[2:05:53] wrote and said I've been my 16-year-old
[2:05:57] son. I want to I want to tell you what
[2:06:00] happened. And it was pages long. Tell
[2:06:03] you that gave me a lot of encouragement.
[2:06:06] The woman says, "Whatever you're doing,
[2:06:07] keep on doing it."
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; It's making a change.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. With whatever God has given,
[2:06:15] whatever experience God has given me, I
[2:06:17] pour it out to you. I give it to you.
[2:06:19] Whatever zeal, whatever, and then you
[2:06:21] pass it on to others.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; I'm saying to this congregation, it's
[2:06:26] not enough to say, "Well, a prophet met
[2:06:28] God." You want to be able to say, you
[2:06:30] have to be able to say, "I met God."
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; I have seen him. Yes.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; When I look in the word, I don't see a
[2:06:37] bunch of dos and don'ts. People say,
[2:06:39] "Oh, I can't do this. I can't do that,
[2:06:41] and I can't have my friends." Nonsense.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Absolute nonsense.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; It's not a bunch of dos and don'ts. It's
[2:06:53] a person.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be really blunt with you. I
[2:06:57] got my wife back there 54 years. I say,
[2:06:59] "Well, what do you know? I got my wife.
[2:07:01] I can't run around. I can't do this. I
[2:07:04] can't have other girlfriend. And what
[2:07:05] kind of life is this? What kind of
[2:07:07] marriage would that be?
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; I have no desire,
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; no ambition.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; It doesn't excite me a bit
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; to be with my wife. That's the thing
[2:07:26] that's in life. That's what's important
[2:07:28] in life.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; What kind of relationship? Brother
[2:07:31] Brandham says if he's going to go
[2:07:33] overseas, his wife took him by the tie
[2:07:34] and pulled him by the tie and said,
[2:07:36] "Listen here, William Brandham, Bill
[2:07:38] Brandham, don't you, you know, don't you
[2:07:40] have any eyes for any other person?
[2:07:41] Don't you do this and don't you do
[2:07:43] that?" He asked, "What what kind of
[2:07:44] marriage would that be?" Say, "Well,
[2:07:46] I've got a piece of paper hangs on the
[2:07:48] wall says I'm married." So what what's a
[2:07:51] piece of paper do? I get a lot of joy
[2:07:53] out of the piece of paper. It's
[2:07:54] something that's inside.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; It's a love your youth. It's a love of
[2:08:02] your first love.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can enjoy your first
[2:08:05] love.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; I'm just tired when people say, "Well,
[2:08:08] you know, the message become kind of a
[2:08:11] dragged out and kind of," you know what
[2:08:12] I mean? It hasn't become dragged out.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; It's more exciting today. I see more in
[2:08:19] the message today than I've ever seen in
[2:08:21] my life.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; I get more out of it today.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; That's absolutely the truth. I get more
[2:08:29] out of it today than I did 30 years ago.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; It's more precious and more wonderful.
[2:08:35] He's more wonderful.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; Going to be done in just a few moments.
[2:08:45] There's a whole whole segment here
[2:08:48] on this very part.
[2:08:52] The scripture says
[2:08:54] that when he shall appear,
[2:08:57] when Christ
[2:08:59] who is our life
[2:09:02] shall appear,
[2:09:04] then shall you also appear with him in
[2:09:08] glory. How come? It's his appearing and
[2:09:12] you seeing the appearing that actually
[2:09:14] has that effect upon you. Then I will
[2:09:17] appear
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; with him
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; in glory.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; When you see him, who is he? He's the
[2:09:23] living word.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; He's a manifested word. He's the word.
[2:09:27] Why did he manifest? Why did he reveal
[2:09:29] himself? Tell me, congregation, he
[2:09:31] reveal himself so you can see him.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; That's the only purpose. He reveals
[2:09:36] himself. He manifests himself. That's
[2:09:39] what the prophet was saying all the
[2:09:40] time. Show us the father. I would see
[2:09:42] Jesus. We would see Jesus curse. We
[2:09:44] would see Jesus. Why did he preach it
[2:09:46] over and over again? So that the people
[2:09:48] could see him.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; And furthermore,
[2:09:53] I wish I had another hour.
[2:09:55] I could tell you that this last age
[2:09:59] is the age
[2:10:02] I don't want to shock you now, but this
[2:10:05] may stun some of you.
[2:10:07] You cannot expect a rapture unless you
[2:10:11] see him.
[2:10:13] Right.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Anybody that thinks I'm just going to
[2:10:18] tood along here, I'm just going to
[2:10:19] coasting along and oh, I'm just looking
[2:10:22] for the rapture. I'm just looking for
[2:10:23] the rapture. I say you better get your
[2:10:26] sights changed because you you've got to
[2:10:28] see him first. Not just see certain
[2:10:31] doctrines in the message, but you have
[2:10:32] to see him, the person.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; You have to encounter.
[2:10:37] You must encounter. And it's not just a
[2:10:39] must, you must do it, but it's there for
[2:10:41] you. I'm even trying to lead you into it
[2:10:44] in a very elementary way, trying to
[2:10:46] teach you like a class. You can do it.
[2:10:49] You absolutely can do it.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I can't. I can't."
[2:10:52] When's the last time you took a message
[2:10:54] and then you
[2:11:04] Abraham never looked with his eyes
[2:11:07] would see an old wrinkled woman. many
[2:11:11] years past the time of life to have
[2:11:13] children. But he looked at the unseen
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; and he saw Isaac.
[2:11:19] When I read those words, I don't think,
[2:11:22] "Oh, wasn't it wonderful, Abraham?" I
[2:11:24] say, "Oh, God, let me see my Isaac.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Let me see my promise." What is my
[2:11:29] promise? I want I I wanted to be able to
[2:11:32] be read of us and these people that were
[2:11:35] filled and who were actually delivered
[2:11:38] out of an hour of corruption.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; They were delivered out of an hour of
[2:11:42] corruption and I they were so changed by
[2:11:45] my atmosphere by my presence. My
[2:11:47] presence is coming.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; I'm just starting friends. His coming
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; is his presence is his person.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; We quote Revelation 10:1. And a mighty
[2:11:59] angel descended. It was his coming. It's
[2:12:01] his personal presence coming for one
[2:12:05] purpose to transform the people so they
[2:12:08] can see their promise.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; And their promises.
[2:12:15] See, you were real quiet when I looked
[2:12:18] about the penal system. talked about our
[2:12:20] crime and talked about violence and
[2:12:22] talked about our things that are going
[2:12:23] on right around you in your world in
[2:12:27] your day in your community in your city.
[2:12:30] We talk about that. We talk about the
[2:12:31] homeless people and talk about all of
[2:12:33] these things. When we talk about that,
[2:12:35] you're very, very quiet,
[2:12:38] but it happens to be a reality.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; But the promise of this day is not that
[2:12:44] that shall have an effect upon us. We're
[2:12:47] living in it and we're called out of it.
[2:12:49] We have been called out of it. But the
[2:12:51] promise is the promise of this of this
[2:12:54] hour is a change of the body. You've
[2:12:56] heard it many times. And the rapture and
[2:12:59] the change and a and a translation.
[2:13:02] That's our promise. I can't see that
[2:13:05] happening outside of a people
[2:13:10] having a
[2:13:12] relationship
[2:13:14] with Jesus Christ. And I am saying to
[2:13:17] you as your brother, as your friend, and
[2:13:20] if you regard me as your pastor, that is
[2:13:24] your p per that is your portion that
[2:13:27] actually belongs to you. And you can go
[2:13:29] out these doors or you can stay in your
[2:13:31] seat after this service and say, "I
[2:13:33] claim that portion. I claim this
[2:13:36] personal presence
[2:13:39] because I'm in that I'm in that time.
[2:13:41] I'm in that age." And don't let the
[2:13:43] devil take it out of you. Don't let
[2:13:46] Don't let the cares of this life take it
[2:13:48] out of you. This belongs to you.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not done.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon spoke to some people and
[2:13:58] he's trying to bring them into this
[2:13:59] atmosphere and he says, "If we could get
[2:14:02] everybody in this church in that
[2:14:05] atmosphere," you know what his next
[2:14:06] statement was? There wouldn't be one
[2:14:08] person in a wheelchair.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; There won't be one sick person here in
[2:14:12] the next 45 minutes.
[2:14:15] Now that's a challenge.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; And did it change from then till now?
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; Not one bit. I believe that if if a if a
[2:14:23] people came into some kind of a unified
[2:14:26] place, some kind of heavenly place, some
[2:14:30] kind of atmosphere where all things are
[2:14:32] possible. I believe without without any
[2:14:36] doubt in my mind, I believe that
[2:14:38] supernatural would have to happen.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; The supernatural could not be held back.
[2:14:45] Amen. You couldn't hold it back.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; In the message, we're going to close
[2:14:57] now. Winding down. In the message called
[2:15:01] out, he said, Jesus said, "As it was in
[2:15:04] the days of Sodom and Gomorra, so will
[2:15:05] it be in the days of the Son of Man."
[2:15:10] In the days that the son of man is
[2:15:12] revealed from heaven, he said, you see
[2:15:14] the message when the son of man is
[2:15:17] revealed from heaven. You see the
[2:15:19] message when the son of man is revealed
[2:15:21] from heaven in the time of decision. He
[2:15:24] said the Bible said that these days
[2:15:26] would come and there would be a famine
[2:15:27] in the land, not a bread and water for
[2:15:29] hearing the true word, but of hearing
[2:15:31] the true word of God. And the people
[2:15:33] would go from east to west, from the
[2:15:35] north to the south seeking to hear the
[2:15:37] true word of God. And here we are
[2:15:41] privileged tonight to see the message of
[2:15:45] God, the angel of God. I'm going to just
[2:15:48] stop there. I have several others. Here
[2:15:50] we are privileged today to see the
[2:15:54] message
[2:15:55] of God, the angel of God.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:03] The very next time
[2:16:08] you pick up a message book
[2:16:14] and begin to read it, I'm talking to
[2:16:16] this entire congregation and all who are
[2:16:18] on the streaming.
[2:16:20] Next time you pick up a message book, I
[2:16:23] want you to remember these words.
[2:16:26] You're not just looking upon a message,
[2:16:30] but you're looking upon the angel of
[2:16:32] God.
[2:16:37] And that's why you have a right. You
[2:16:39] might say, "Oh, brother brother Ed, I
[2:16:41] think you've gone over. I think you've
[2:16:42] stepped over the line." Well, I'll tell
[2:16:44] you to prove it to yourself.
[2:16:47] You just start talking to God about
[2:16:49] that. And you start telling him, I
[2:16:52] believe
[2:16:54] that the angel of God, the angel of the
[2:16:57] covenant, none other than Jesus Christ
[2:17:00] resurrected,
[2:17:02] is here presently now and is inspiring
[2:17:07] these words to me.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; Something of a special nature right now.
[2:17:13] Something special is speaking to me out
[2:17:15] of this word. Just these two or three
[2:17:18] lines are special. And you just keep
[2:17:21] hovering over it. God,
[2:17:24] brother Biscll just told me this is the
[2:17:28] angel of the Lord. This is the angel.
[2:17:31] When you read the scriptures, you can
[2:17:32] say
[2:17:34] it's the author, the one, my bridegroom
[2:17:37] is the author of this. But when you read
[2:17:39] the message, I tell you what, important
[2:17:41] to have the message because the message,
[2:17:44] the end time message
[2:17:47] is meets the end time conditions. That's
[2:17:49] right.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends, if this is
[2:17:53] the last service I'd ever speak, your
[2:17:55] government isn't going to sol solve it.
[2:17:58] And all of the agencies and all the
[2:18:00] institutions and all the charities and
[2:18:02] everything that is being done and all
[2:18:04] the religion is not going to solve it.
[2:18:07] Look at the look at all the religion.
[2:18:09] Look at all the all all we have. Look at
[2:18:11] all the television. Look at everything
[2:18:12] that's going on. Why is the world in the
[2:18:14] state that it's in? I can tell you that
[2:18:16] the elect of God that God has called,
[2:18:20] that God has revealed himself to, they
[2:18:22] have been called. You you if you sense
[2:18:24] it or you have a witness that you're
[2:18:26] elect of God, let me tell you once
[2:18:28] again, I'm repeating it over and over
[2:18:30] and over, God has elected you to meet
[2:18:33] with him and have a personal encounter
[2:18:36] with him.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; And when you have that, friends,
[2:18:45] Why am I preaching this? Because I don't
[2:18:48] want to go into this camp and just have
[2:18:52] a repetition of people around the altar
[2:18:56] and having some kind of an emotional
[2:18:58] experience.
[2:18:59] I don't care if you never came to the
[2:19:01] altar.
[2:19:05] If you came from home and said, "Brother
[2:19:08] Ed,
[2:19:09] that what you talked about last night,
[2:19:12] what you talked about Sunday morning, I
[2:19:14] had that last night." I was in my room
[2:19:18] and he came to me there. I felt a
[2:19:20] strange presence. I opened up the
[2:19:22] scripture. I opened up a message. But I
[2:19:24] listened to a certain message
[2:19:28] and he came to me. It's a transforming
[2:19:31] experience.
[2:19:33] This is what I pray for you. And this is
[2:19:35] what I'm praying for this for this camp
[2:19:38] that we're coming into.
[2:19:42] Why am I preaching this way?
[2:19:45] Look at friends. It hasn't. Please,
[2:19:48] please understand me. The congregation
[2:19:51] here happens to be a very unique
[2:19:54] congregation.
[2:19:55] You got people from South America. I'm
[2:19:57] looking at right now. people from people
[2:20:00] from the colony, people from Bosnia,
[2:20:02] people from all over.
[2:20:05] I spoke with brother Jake and sister
[2:20:07] Aana
[2:20:08] at the wedding last night. I didn't say
[2:20:10] anything at the reception of the
[2:20:11] wedding. Brother John took the wedding.
[2:20:13] My wife said, "One of the most lovely
[2:20:15] weddings she's been to. So beautiful, so
[2:20:18] simple, and so wonderful."
[2:20:22] I spoke with the mother and father of
[2:20:25] Sister Esther last night. I said, 'Now,
[2:20:27] and here's where I see things, and this
[2:20:28] is where I'm at this morning. Isn't it
[2:20:31] strange?
[2:20:33] I said, ' There's two young people
[2:20:35] sitting there at the head table. Both of
[2:20:37] them come from just a few miles apart in
[2:20:39] Manitoba.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; Both of them come here for the word.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; Only for the word.
[2:20:48] And both of them with their special
[2:20:50] struggles
[2:20:52] came here for the word.
[2:20:54] I sat and counseledled with them as they
[2:20:57] moved towards their marriage. I had a
[2:20:59] great affinity with them.
[2:21:06] I and my wife
[2:21:09] said, "Isn't it amazing
[2:21:12] what what is the reasoning behind God
[2:21:14] that they come each of them from two
[2:21:16] different directions but from the same
[2:21:17] place 1500 miles and then when they
[2:21:21] arrive here they meet one another
[2:21:25] in a different way in different fashion
[2:21:28] and end up as husband and wife. Oh, is
[2:21:31] that just some light thing that happens?
[2:21:33] I don't think so. I think you'd read
[2:21:35] that in the economy of God. I think
[2:21:37] you'll find out some answer about that
[2:21:39] on the other side. And then where do you
[2:21:41] come from? And why are you here? I look
[2:21:43] at some from California and I see some
[2:21:46] from Missouri and Oklahoma and wherever
[2:21:48] they are. Some from Alaska and some from
[2:21:50] Europe and some from Germany and some
[2:21:52] from the UK and some from South South
[2:21:55] Africa and some from this place and that
[2:21:57] place. Hey,
[2:22:00] you're not being paid to be here. Why
[2:22:02] are you here?
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; I want you to come to that. Why am I
[2:22:06] here?
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; And you need to be able to come to the
[2:22:09] conclusion because the almighty one led
[2:22:12] me to this spot.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; And because he's led me to this spot, I
[2:22:17] have a certain responsibility. I have a
[2:22:20] certain and the pastor is laying it upon
[2:22:22] us this morning that we that have been
[2:22:24] given something. We that have been given
[2:22:26] whatever measure we've been given. We
[2:22:29] have that measure to disperse and to
[2:22:31] dispense with one way or another. I
[2:22:33] don't care whether it's a washing a
[2:22:35] dish. I don't care whether it's sending
[2:22:37] out a hub. I don't care. It did be good
[2:22:39] to walk into the office and see brother
[2:22:41] Darren Hoffman with his 15year-old son
[2:22:44] working at taking and uploading the
[2:22:46] messages and doing whatever they could
[2:22:48] with them. I don't understand it. I'm
[2:22:50] glad it's not my job, but I'm glad that
[2:22:52] we're being able to send out a a a
[2:22:54] measure that God gave us.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, as your friend,
[2:23:05] don't ever think for a minute, oh well,
[2:23:08] what brother Biscll spoke about this
[2:23:09] morning, that's just his experience
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; and that's just Brother Brandham's
[2:23:14] experience. That's not so. Amen.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; That can be your experience.
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; A wonderful experience with God.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; Every one of you.
[2:23:29] And listen,
[2:23:31] are you listening?
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, you know, I tried it
[2:23:36] next week and it didn't work."
[2:23:40] Oh my. Is that all it's worth? Is that
[2:23:43] all it's worth is next week?
[2:23:46] Isn't it worth more than that?
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is worth more than that.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; And if he won't meet me next week, I'll
[2:23:53] be there the next week. And if it's not
[2:23:55] this month, I'll be there next month.
[2:23:57] And if it's not this year, it'll be next
[2:23:59] year. And whatever it takes, I'm going
[2:24:01] to be there available. And let him
[2:24:03] choose the time. And let him choose the
[2:24:06] place. But I want him to know I'm ready
[2:24:08] now. And I'll be ready next week. And I
[2:24:11] through the camp, I'll be ready. And if
[2:24:13] he doesn't do anything then, oh, I know
[2:24:15] that it's such a reality. I'll be there
[2:24:17] when he wants to do it.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:24:24] I'll ask you to bow your head in prayer.
[2:24:29] Gracious Father,
[2:24:32] what unusual times these are, Lord. What
[2:24:35] an unusual
[2:24:37] service for myself, oh God. and to
[2:24:41] realize, Lord, we're seeking to bring
[2:24:43] the people down. I know that they know
[2:24:45] the message, but now we want, oh God, to
[2:24:50] introduce them to the essence of it, to
[2:24:53] the very person of it, the person of the
[2:24:56] word. Oh God, I pray that you'll grant
[2:25:00] it in the name of Jesus Christ. As we're
[2:25:02] coming to the close of this particular
[2:25:05] service and we have the young man to be
[2:25:07] baptized, I pray, Father, as he's
[2:25:09] preparing now and making ready, may the
[2:25:12] Holy Spirit hover over him, oh God. And
[2:25:14] how I prayed already this morning, that
[2:25:17] you would bring him up out of the water
[2:25:19] full of the Holy Ghost. Fill him, oh
[2:25:21] God, so that his life will be
[2:25:23] transformed from this day forward in the
[2:25:26] name of Jesus Christ. And for your
[2:25:27] glory, and your glory alone, I ask it.
[2:25:31] Amen.
[2:25:33] Amen.
[2:25:36] Brother Beniah is being baptized.
[2:25:40] And if you'll just go,
[2:25:47] I trust you were able to really catch.
[2:25:53] So
[2:25:55] just for this couple moments now
[2:25:59] why did I why did I refer to all the
[2:26:02] violence and all the things that the
[2:26:04] government's saying about it is because
[2:26:07] they realize listen closely now they
[2:26:10] realize that and a person looks just
[2:26:14] looking at something and hearing words
[2:26:18] it elicits
[2:26:20] a reaction from them
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; and they become aggressive.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; They become that from what they see and
[2:26:28] what they hear.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; Understand? Then I shifted it over to
[2:26:33] the word
[2:26:37] and what you see. If you just see in
[2:26:39] there, well, this is the way I'm
[2:26:41] supposed to act as a husband. This is
[2:26:42] the way I'm supposed to be as a young
[2:26:43] person. This is what I'm supposed to be.
[2:26:45] This is what I can do and this is what I
[2:26:47] can't do. If that's all you see,
[2:26:49] there'll be no supernatural change.
[2:26:53] But when you're looking, and this all I
[2:26:55] want to inform you of this morning, when
[2:26:57] you're looking at it
[2:27:00] and you are in expectation,
[2:27:04] it will those words will elicit, not
[2:27:08] illicit, elicit,
[2:27:10] draw out a response.
[2:27:13] Then I shifted to brother Brandham.
[2:27:16] There's a storm and he sees the rainbow
[2:27:19] crystals in the frozen crystals and he
[2:27:22] hears the elk bugling, one answering the
[2:27:25] other. And he hears a gray wolf howl and
[2:27:30] he looks at that and it elicits in him a
[2:27:35] response. And what's he do? Oh great
[2:27:38] Jehovah.
[2:27:40] And he tells you why. He said, "I saw
[2:27:43] God."
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; He didn't just see some frozen trees. He
[2:27:48] didn't just hear a wolf howl. He just
[2:27:50] didn't hear an elk bugle. He saw God.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; It elicited a vision. Jacob wrestled
[2:27:57] with a man. But when he was done, he saw
[2:28:00] God.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; Didn't just see a man. Just didn't have
[2:28:03] a wrestling match. But the whole
[2:28:05] experience elicited out of him, brought
[2:28:07] out of him, drew out of him a response.
[2:28:10] And the reason why it could do that was
[2:28:12] because he was elected to it in the
[2:28:14] first place.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; To a lot of people, it won't mean
[2:28:20] anything.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; But to you and I,
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; it means everything.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; A lot of people read the message doesn't
[2:28:26] mean anything. But to others, it brings
[2:28:29] it elicits. I want to use that word. It
[2:28:31] evokes as it were it it it brings a a
[2:28:34] stimulus out of stimulates a person to
[2:28:37] the experience.
[2:28:39] Another person has it and it doesn't
[2:28:41] mean anything. I went to church. Another
[2:28:44] person says, "I heard things that
[2:28:48] changed my life forever."
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; Stand, will you please? Thank you for
[2:28:53] your time,
[2:28:55] your kind attention, your very kind
[2:28:57] congregation.
[2:28:59] Those
[2:29:01] of you that are visiting, it's been a
[2:29:02] long service. There's no service tonight
[2:29:05] as we know.
[2:29:10] I want to sing Linda same song. He's the
[2:29:13] same God.
[2:29:15] Spoke to the woman at the well.
[2:29:21] And I say to you, he's the same God that
[2:29:25] wrestled with Jacob.
[2:29:28] He's the same God that just a few years
[2:29:31] ago stood at the platform
[2:29:34] and that cannot change. If you think
[2:29:37] somehow it's something less, it will be
[2:29:39] less. But if you think if you think say
[2:29:41] in your heart, I'm in agreement with
[2:29:43] you. Oh, I'm with you, brother Ed.
[2:29:45] That's what I'd like to have the
[2:29:46] congregation. I'd like you to come
[2:29:48] forward in your spirit and say, I'm with
[2:29:50] you. I believe that. I believe in that
[2:29:53] experience you had. And I believe that
[2:29:54] that same one that's in automobile is my
[2:29:57] Lord. That's my God. Hallelujah.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; The same God who spoke to the woman at
[2:30:18] the well.
[2:30:20] The same God
[2:30:22] is wonders.
[2:30:24] Too many to tell.
[2:30:29] The same God
[2:30:31] who parted
[2:30:33] the raing
[2:30:35] sea.
[2:30:39] He's the same God
[2:30:42] who's wearing
[2:30:44] me.
[2:30:46] Well,
[2:30:48] the same God God spoke to the woman at
[2:30:54] the well.
[2:30:56] The same God
[2:30:59] who wonders
[2:31:01] too many to hell.
[2:31:05] The same God who parted
[2:31:09] the raing.
[2:31:15] Oh, he's the same God who's living in
[2:31:20] me.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; There's been a change in me.
[2:31:29] There's been a change in me.
[2:31:34] Since Jesus set me free.
[2:31:39] I've been to Calary.
[2:31:44] I'm born again.
[2:31:48] I cannot turn around.
[2:31:53] My kingom solid ground.
[2:31:58] Someday I'll wear a ground.
[2:32:03] Oh, what a change.
[2:32:08] Amen. You may be seated. God bless you.
[2:32:17] Praise the Lord.
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; We have Baniah Dick standing in the
[2:32:21] waters of baptism with me this morning.
[2:32:24] And it's very appropriate because we're
[2:32:27] going into camp. And I asked brother
[2:32:29] Banana when did God deal with you? He
[2:32:31] said it was at last camp. So I feel that
[2:32:35] this is just
[2:32:37] uh an example of a great harvest that
[2:32:41] we're going to expect from our from our
[2:32:43] families and children that are in the
[2:32:45] church. Brother Vaniah has a great
[2:32:48] desire for the things of God. That
[2:32:51] doesn't come from man. It doesn't come
[2:32:52] from a father. Doesn't come from a
[2:32:54] mother. That desire comes from God. And
[2:32:58] brother Baniah has been asking his
[2:33:00] father to be baptized for how long?
[2:33:02] Baniah?
[2:33:03] about a year.
[2:33:05] So I asked Brother Vaniah, I said, "When
[2:33:08] dad said to wait,
[2:33:11] how did you feel?" Did you just turn
[2:33:14] around say, "Well, maybe next time, but
[2:33:17] how did you feel?" Said, "Brother,
[2:33:20] brother Tom, I felt just a little
[2:33:24] disappointed
[2:33:26] because this is what I want. This is
[2:33:29] what I'm desiring."
[2:33:31] The Bible says this in Acts 2, and we
[2:33:34] read it often. It said, "When they'd
[2:33:36] heard this, they were pricricked within
[2:33:39] their hearts." That means they were
[2:33:40] moved in the inner man. They desired
[2:33:43] something. They saw the word manifested,
[2:33:46] and that's what they desired. They
[2:33:48] wanted God, a living reality.
[2:33:51] Brother Vaniah just doesn't want to get
[2:33:53] wet this morning. He wants the living
[2:33:56] reality
[2:33:58] of a burning god within his soul. He
[2:34:03] also has felt pricked in his heart and
[2:34:06] he has said also, "What must I do to get
[2:34:10] filled with God?" And we had a wonderful
[2:34:12] time around the word. Brother Baniah,
[2:34:15] maybe you'd like to say what God's been
[2:34:17] dealing with you.
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; I just want to thank everybody for if
[2:34:20] they they might not think they've
[2:34:23] influenced anything, but Everybody's
[2:34:25] been a part.
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; Everybody's had a part to play.
[2:34:32] Counselors,
[2:34:33] ministry, brothers and sisters that have
[2:34:36] given their time. May God bless you. God
[2:34:39] bless you, brother Vaniah, for your
[2:34:41] desire for the things of God. Let's bow
[2:34:44] our heads and make a prayer.
[2:34:49] Lord, a great cry came out one day when
[2:34:52] the word of God was fulfilled.
[2:34:55] what must we do?
[2:34:57] And the word responded back, repent and
[2:35:00] be baptized, every one of you, in the
[2:35:02] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[2:35:04] of your sins, and you shall receive the
[2:35:06] gift of the Holy Ghost. Lord, Brother
[2:35:10] Baniah this morning has a great desire
[2:35:12] within his soul to be filled with God.
[2:35:15] Lord, over the last few meetings, Lord,
[2:35:17] that's what he's desired. as Jacob had
[2:35:19] an encounter. May he have an encounter
[2:35:22] with that same pillar of fire. Lord God,
[2:35:25] he's wrestled with it and now he's
[2:35:27] surrendering. He's offering himself and
[2:35:29] asking, Lord, here am I. Fill me. I
[2:35:34] commit him to you in the name of Jesus
[2:35:36] Christ. Lord, take this young man and
[2:35:39] use him for the kingdom. Let the fire of
[2:35:41] God burn deep within his soul. Use him.
[2:35:45] We pray in Jesus name. And brother
[2:35:48] Baniah, by your confession that Jesus
[2:35:51] Christ is your savior, I baptize you in
[2:35:54] true Christian baptism in the name of
[2:35:57] our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:36:20] Amen.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; How many know the song Face to Face with
[2:36:26] Christ my Savior? Can I see your hands?
[2:36:33] Couple more. Wonderful song. Surely you
[2:36:37] know it. And did you raise your hand?
[2:36:39] You did. Okay. I know. Hey. Oh.
[2:36:45] Um,
[2:36:48] do we have it in the book there?
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; 978.
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; 978.
[2:37:00] I'm going to need a lot of power here.
[2:37:02] Do you know this one, Brother Derek?
[2:37:06] How many are you going to learn it?
[2:37:09] Oh my, that's absolutely wonderful.
[2:37:13] Hallelujah.
[2:37:15] You know it, brother Paul.
[2:37:18] All right, somebody reach brother Paul a
[2:37:21] microphone. Come up here, Brother Paul,
[2:37:23] and help us out.
[2:37:29] Who else knows it real well?
[2:37:33] All right.
[2:37:36] Come on, Jake. Come on, brother Paul. We
[2:37:39] We need We need to We need the senior
[2:37:41] choir. Come, Brother Gabriel.
[2:37:44] All right. We got a lot of strength
[2:37:47] here.
[2:37:49] Brother Andes, you know it. Of course
[2:37:51] you do. Why don't you come up here as
[2:37:54] well? Do we have enough microphones?
[2:37:59] Yes. All right. Isn't this a nice
[2:38:01] impromptu choir?
[2:38:04] Hallelujah. Any other man want to join
[2:38:07] us here?
[2:38:09] Brother Codle, do you know it? You
[2:38:11] don't. All right. All right.
[2:38:20] Your brother's going to Okay. Give us a
[2:38:21] lot of support. You know it. Real
[2:38:23] wonderful. All right. First verse. Have
[2:38:25] we have the first verse up?
[2:38:30] face to face with Christ my Sior.
[2:38:38] Face to face, what will it be?
[2:38:45] When with rapture I behold
[2:38:50] him, Jesus Christ to die for me.
[2:38:58] Face to face the night.
[2:39:05] Far beyond the starry sky.
[2:39:11] Face to face in all his glory.
[2:39:17] I shall see him
[2:39:21] and
[2:39:23] do the third verse please. Third verse.
[2:39:26] What? of rejoicing in his presence.
[2:39:33] When our plan is free and
[2:39:39] when the crooked ways are straight
[2:39:45] and the dark
[2:39:49] stand we sing the chorus now face to
[2:39:54] face I behold
[2:39:57] him
[2:39:59] far beyond the starry sky.
[2:40:06] to praise him in all his glory.
[2:40:11] I shall see him by and
[2:40:17] &gt;&gt; now before we sing it again, just
[2:40:18] remember the author when they wrote this
[2:40:21] one. Was that Fanny Crosby?
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; Pardon? Yes. Fanny Crosby sang uh this
[2:40:28] song because she was blind.
[2:40:32] And I believe it was it's reported that
[2:40:34] she said she sees much more blind
[2:40:37] &gt;&gt; than most people do with their sight.
[2:40:41] And she
[2:40:43] was inspired and wrote this and that was
[2:40:46] for her age.
[2:40:48] If I take the entire if I take the
[2:40:51] entire substance of the message, I have
[2:40:55] to say you on the authority of the word
[2:40:57] of God, it's your portion. Not to see
[2:41:00] him in the by and by, but to see him
[2:41:02] absolutely right now.
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; And that does not take away that we
[2:41:06] shall see him in his corporal body.
[2:41:08] Brother Brandham talks about seeing him
[2:41:09] in his corporal body. But we can see him
[2:41:12] now in reality.
[2:41:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you read the words,
[2:41:16] you're reading his words.
[2:41:19] &gt;&gt; And let that let that draw you in. Let
[2:41:21] that elicit an experience for you. I
[2:41:24] want to see not one, two, I hope that
[2:41:26] there's a a lot of people that send me a
[2:41:29] text, send me an email, shake my hand,
[2:41:31] and say that service set my direction.
[2:41:36] And I would not settle for anything less
[2:41:38] than that kind of meeting with God.
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; Don't come and whimper to me that that's
[2:41:44] what you want. Go and get it and then
[2:41:46] come back and tell me I had it.
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; All right. Street
[2:41:54] to face shall I behold
[2:41:58] him.
[2:42:00] Far beyond the starry sky
[2:42:06] face to face in all his glory.
[2:42:12] I shall see him by and one more time.
[2:42:19] Praise his face and I behold
[2:42:24] him
[2:42:26] far
[2:42:27] on the starry sky.
[2:42:32] Face to face in all his glory.
[2:42:38] I shall see him by and by.
[2:42:45] Amen. We'll just remain here if you
[2:42:47] would. Brother brother brother West
[2:42:48] Nygard. I feel to have you come and
[2:42:50] close us in prayer.
[2:42:55] While our brother Wes leads us in
[2:42:56] prayer, maybe you might want to raise
[2:43:00] your hand and say, "Brother brother
[2:43:03] Biscll, I'm set in a certain direction.
[2:43:08] I have a new vision this morning
[2:43:11] and I my my hunger has been wetted. My
[2:43:14] thirst has is has increased and God will
[2:43:17] meet that for you." come by the last
[2:43:19] place.
[2:43:24] Let's bow our heads.
[2:43:27] Gracious heavenly father, Lord God, we
[2:43:30] thank you for the word that you brought
[2:43:31] to us this morning.
[2:43:33] Father God, you saw each and every one
[2:43:35] of us here this morning in our place.
[2:43:37] Lord God, you know what each one of us
[2:43:38] needed, Lord God. Father, you have
[2:43:41] brought us a word, a message that will
[2:43:44] preserve us, Lord God. There is nothing
[2:43:47] else that will hold us, Lord God.
[2:43:50] Nothing else that will preserve us but
[2:43:51] your word, Lord God. Father, it is our
[2:43:54] deep desire to go farther, deeper,
[2:43:57] higher with you, Lord God. Father God,
[2:43:59] to be drawn closer to you, Lord God.
[2:44:02] Heavenly Father, to be a reflection of
[2:44:04] you here on earth, Lord God. Father, we
[2:44:07] would grant it to be the greatest
[2:44:08] privilege, Lord God, to be living
[2:44:09] testimonies for you. And we thank you
[2:44:11] for where you've brought us to, Lord
[2:44:13] God. Father, we thank you for
[2:44:14] manifesting your word in our life,
[2:44:16] Father. We thank you for revealing
[2:44:18] yourself in our life. But Lord God, we
[2:44:20] desire to draw closer. We desire more of
[2:44:23] you, Father. And we believe, Lord God,
[2:44:25] that you've lifted us higher. You've
[2:44:27] given us one more word to draw closer to
[2:44:29] you, a preserving word, Lord God. That,
[2:44:32] Father, as we leave here this morning,
[2:44:34] Lord God, that we're walking closer with
[2:44:36] you, Father. Lord God, it is our desire,
[2:44:40] Father, to receive our promise, Lord,
[2:44:43] that you've given us, Lord. Father, we
[2:44:45] thank you for the word that you've given
[2:44:47] us. We thank you for the ministry that
[2:44:49] you've given us, Lord. Father, we ask
[2:44:51] that you bless the gift, Lord God. Bless
[2:44:54] the man. Rejuvenate the man he's given
[2:44:56] of himself this morning, Lord God. Be
[2:44:59] with each and every one of us now as we
[2:45:01] go our separate way, Lord God. Father,
[2:45:03] may the word be an everpresent thought
[2:45:05] upon our mind, upon our heart. May we
[2:45:07] meditate on it. May we dwell upon it,
[2:45:09] Father. Lord God, may it not go in one
[2:45:12] ear and out the other. But Father, may
[2:45:14] it drop down into our heart, down into
[2:45:16] our soul, and know, Lord God, that it
[2:45:19] will be the only thing that will
[2:45:20] preserve us. There is no government.
[2:45:22] There is no other man. It's only you
[2:45:24] that will preserve us, Father. Lord, be
[2:45:27] with us now. Be with each and every one
[2:45:29] of us from the oldest to the youngest to
[2:45:31] each and everyone. We thank you, Lord
[2:45:33] God. We love you. We praise you, Father.
[2:45:36] There's no other father like you. We
[2:45:39] love you. Go with us now. In Jesus
[2:45:41] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[2:45:48] &gt;&gt; We dismiss you in the name of our Lord
[2:45:50] Jesus Christ. Trust you. Go out with
[2:45:53] more than what you came in. You're
[2:45:55] dismissed in Jesus name. And may greet
[2:45:57] one another.
[2:46:29] Thank you.
[2:47:39] Hallelujah.
[2:49:06] I see you.
[2:49:09] I see you.
[2:51:18] Heat.
[2:51:35] Heat.
