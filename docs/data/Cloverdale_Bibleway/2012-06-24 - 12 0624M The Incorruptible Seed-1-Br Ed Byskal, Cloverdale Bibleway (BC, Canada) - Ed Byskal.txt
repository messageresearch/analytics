What a great confession that we can come this morning already claiming the promises Lord that you have laid out before us to agree together that it's a finished work. Hallelujah. For you to have a prayer request on your heart this morning. Just make it known by the uplifted hand. We want to remember the Lei family. Sister Jenny Lelay, her sister-in-law has requested that we pray for her family. a brother and her brother and his wife were killed yesterday in an accident and 17-year-old son is left with no parents. We ask that the Lord would give them strength and above all that God's love would shine through. Amen. If you have a need upon your heart this morning in this atmosphere, Brother Tom, would you come this morning? [Music] Our dear heavenly father, Lord, as we've sung the songs and are singing the songs of glory and praise, Lord, I love that song, all hail the power of Jesus name. Let angels prostrate fall. Bring forth the royal diadem and crown him Lord of all. That's what we want to do this morning, Lord. We want to crown you with our praise. We want to crown you, Lord God, this morning. We want to lift up that holy name, Lord. We want to praise you this morning for you're worthy of all praise and glory and honor. Truly, God, you have said in your word, because I live, you shall live also. What a promise that is. And what a hope that is, Lord, when we see a dying generation that that resurrection life can be our portion this morning that you have given us this glorious hope and promise within our hearts, Lord. And father, as brother Derek has read these requests, Lord, there's only one that can give the bomb of Gilead. There's only one that is the mighty conqueror. There's only one that can give that comfort and that is you. Lord, would you come riding on this scene and minister to that family that with this great loss at this time, Father, we just pray for every need and divine presence. We just pray God that your presence will come down. Lord, as your prophet so often said, a greater than Solomon is here, a greater than Jonah is here. Lord, we're not looking to a God of 2,000 years ago. We're looking to a resurrected king that is walking, Lord, in this generation. May we reach out and touch the high priest this morning. Lord, let our minds not go back, Lord, in history, but may we see a living God that is present and amongst us, and we want to rejoice in that. Father, would you bless Brother Biscell as he'll bring the word? Anoint the vessel. Anoint him, Lord God, to speak to us, sayeth the Lord, the word of God that we have, spiritual food in due season at this time. Anoint him and anoint us to hear what the spirit would say to the church. Lord, I've come this morning with great anticipation, the God that I'll hear from the throne of grace. Here's my cup. I lift it up to you. Fill it this morning, Lord. And every heart that has come in need this morning. May you, the supplier of all our needs, come on the scene and minister life to each and every one, Lord, as we commit all things now to you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you this morning. As you have your seats, we're going to have the Sunday school children come right in this morning. They've got a couple of songs for us and I believe that brother Richard's going to be uh presenting the ministry with the missionary offering from the Sunday school for the year. Another summer's approaching a spring has passed and the I believe this is the last day for the Sunday school children. So, we're real thankful for them. Brother John gave some statistics a few services ago, and this is a very critical time in a young person's life for their future walk with Jesus Christ. In the years between, I believe it's five and and 12 or 13 years old. 80% of those that will ever give their life to Jesus Christ do so by the time they're 13 years old. So, it's very important that we have our children in Sunday school and it's a real blessing to us. We do have a new member of the congregation. Eugene and Gina and Lily Ivano are very proud to announce the new addition to their family. Paul Pavle, however you say Paul, the various languages. Vladimir Evini Ivano, &gt;&gt; born June 20th at 9:53 p.m. The Ivanenko family, this Ivanko family, I had to get that right, is very blessed and happy and all are doing amazingly well. So we want to give them a hand this morning. Amen. If you're visiting with us this morning, we want to certainly say God bless you and greet you this morning. Trust that it's wonderful time in his presence with us this morning. We almost have them all set. Aren't they wonderful? Amen. Why don't we give the children a hand before they start to sing? God bless you. [Music] It's time to praise the Lord [Music] in the sanctuary of his holy spirit. [Music] So set your mind on him and let your praise begin. And the glory of the Lord will fill this place. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] He lives within the praises of his people. He loves to hear them call upon his name. [Music] So set your mind on him and let your praise begin. And the glory of the Lord will fill this place. [Music] Praise the Lord. [Music] Don't you know it's time to praise the Lord in the sanctuary of his holy spirit. So set your mind on him and let your praise begin and the glory of the Lord will fill his place. [Music] Praise the Lord. He lives within the praises of his people. He loves to hear and call upon his name. [Music] So set your mind on him and let your praise begin. And the glory of the Lord will fill this place. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. [Applause] Jesus is stronger. &gt;&gt; Jesus is wiser. Jesus is richer. Jesus is greater than any other king. We want to see Jesus lifted high. A ladder that flies across the land. Let all the night see the truth and know he's the way to heaven. We want to see Jesus lifted high across the land. Come and let's see the truth and know the way to heaven. We want to see, we want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high. We want to see, we want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high. [Music] See Jesus lifted high up and fly across the land. He is the way to heaven. We want to see Jesus lifted high across the land. I see the truth and know he is the way to heaven. We want to see. We want to see. We want to see Jesus lifted high. We want to see. We want to see. We want to see Jesus lifted high. Every step I'm moving forward to my little every down and down and down and down. [Music] You want to see Jesus lifted high, a banner that flies across the land. Set up the night, see the truth that knows. He's the way to see Jesus lifted high across the land. Let all see that you can know that he is the way to heaven. We want to see. We want to see. We want to see Jesus lifted high. We want to see. We want to see. We want to see Jesus lifted high. We're going to see. We're going to see. We're going to see Jesus lifted high. We're going to see. We're going to see We're going to see Jesus lifted high. [Music] [Applause] As Christian families, our basic goal is to lift Jesus Christ higher in our lives, in the lives of our children. Um, when the word of God is placed in its proper position in our lives and family, then we're within the perfect will of God to prosper both spiritually and naturally for ourselves and of course for our families. Go ye into all the world. The great commission was Christ's command. It begs to bring up the question, have you spread the gospel to all of your world? And I was thinking about it this morning. I thought, you know, who knows the gifts or the callings that God has laid in the lives of these our children? who will spread the gospel that you the parent have swn into their hearts through your example in Christ. So the purpose of the Sunday school missionary offering is to assist in this regard uh because our personal world here is actually quite limited. Perhaps by God's grace, we can help to expand that world through others that we help along their way by making the gift of the word of God available to other parents so they have the perfect word of God to influence their families. Also, &gt;&gt; having said that, brother Joshua, you can go and and uh sister Sabrina and brother Thanks, Josh. &gt;&gt; This one's mine. That one's yours. &gt;&gt; Okay. Missionary offering. Cloverdale Bible Way Sunday School. The Sunday school of Cloverdale Bible Way would like to present their 2012 missionary offering to Bible believers to be used toward the support of the work of Brother Timothy Ma and uh believers in Vietnam. This uh this year's missionary offering consists of $443, $43,40 Canadian and $106.28 u US for a total of $54068. Brother Richard Drake in Sunday school. Amen. Appreciate Appreciate that. Thank you, Sunday school. &gt;&gt; And we love the singing. &gt;&gt; That was great. Wonderful. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Maybe you just put Looks like an old bullet. I told brother Richard that that case that they put all the offering in looks like a a bullet case. And he said it is. So I guess we're going to send a lot of bullets over. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; Let's sing together while the Sunday school children are going out. This little light of mine, well, I'm going to let it shine. Yes. This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine. This little light of mine. Oh, I'm going to let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. Oh, this little light of mine. I said, "Yes, this little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine. This light of mine, I'm going to let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. All around my neighborhood. Shine all around my neighborhood. all over the world. Shine it around my neighbor. I'm going to let it shine. Shine it around my neighbor. I'm going to let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine.

Let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. Praise the Lord. You sound like a victorious church this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Has the word prepared you &gt;&gt; for such a time as this? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we stand together this morning as we invite our pastor just been away ministering. Amen. We want to pray that God will anoint the gift this morning. &gt;&gt; Give us ears to hear. &gt;&gt; It's a great darkness throughout the land, but he said that there would be a light in the evening time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe we could sing together as we just desire that the Holy Spirit would come and anoint the word this morning as the deer pandeth for the water. Do you have a deep desire this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. As the dear plant is home, the water so my soul longeth after thee. [Music] You alone are my heart's desire and I want to worship thee. [Music] For you alone are my strength, my shield. For you alone as my spirit. [Music] You have my higher to worship thee. Amen. And that's why we've gathered here today &gt;&gt; to worship him and in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, we have a testimony I I need to read. And just before I do, I I want to say with regards to the meetings, Brother Benny Perry called this week after the meetings were over and he said about five different ministers have come and spoke to him. uh they were just a uh we had an unusual set of meetings and I guess one of the main reasons was that they haven't had some services for perhaps two or three years. I haven't been there for several years and the people came with I don't believe I've ever seen a group of people come with such expectation and that makes all the difference. They were literally filled with expectation. Even they picked us up in the car. The drivers in the car said, you know, we're just we're just so expecting in these meetings. We've been so anxious to have these meetings. And that was one of the things that I thought soon as I started to hear that, I just heard it from everybody. I just said, "It's going to be different. That's all it takes. Going to be different. Hardly hardly makes any difference who's standing up behind the pullpit. God's not going to disappoint the people. Amen. And it depends on how you came this morning. God's not going to disappoint you, friend. &gt;&gt; He's a good shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knows exactly what we need. &gt;&gt; We have a testimony, and this is from Sister Maria Rosales. Uh she said, "I just want to thank the the Lord for his grace and mercy. 5 months ago, I went to the doctor and had some tests done. And the doctor was concerned uh because about something in my body that wasn't normal. And the doctor said he it might be cancer. So, he sent me to a another specialist for more serious tests. And during this time, I was going through a big battle, but I was coming. I was claiming my healing. And the Lord said to just rest in him. Finally, on June 22nd, and that's just now, I went for my final results and the doctor said that there is no cancer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to praise the Lord and I know that &gt;&gt; and I know I have have done the devil uh I have the done the devil under the feet and he is defeated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to thank the ministry for praying for me and for the saints who knew and were praying too. And I also want to thank the ministry because all the services being preached are such an encouragement. God bless all sister Maria Rosales and the family. &gt;&gt; And it was some time ago that brother Jose and sister Maria Maria came here to the front and we had prayer with them and they described what was taking place and I could see the heaviness on uh on on the face. not discouragement, just heaviness, just the weight of these tests and everything else. We're all human and uh and we're when we're facing the unknown, it it's good to face the unknown sometimes because then we can we tend to get more serious &gt;&gt; with God. God needs to get us in a serious place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we're we're rejoicing. uh brother Jose and sister Maria and I I felt that it was just exactly appropriate and right. You came forward with your wife and they didn't make a big declaration amongst the people as such. Just had a few of their friends I suppose I don't know outside of just ourselves who knew but I haven't told anyone and we just waited because we believe that everything will be all right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe that way. So we're happy to have and I'm sure brother brother Tom and Joanne are happy to have Joel back from China. Uh I haven't seen him yet myself but uh yes he is there. Do you want to greet the people in Chinese or No, not not this morning. He's been learning some. So that's good. Maybe you're going to be missionary back there. Who knows? Hallelujah. We want to be remembering uh we have brother Ivan who's been there now for quite some weeks and time and 10 months last year. Brother Murphy left on last Monday. We have emailed back and forth uh since he's arrived and in fact as he met brother Joel there just before Joel was coming out and then brother Timothy Ma is in Vietnam and will be for probably the next couple months. You know people talk about making trips to some of these foreign countries. This this is not just going over, you know, for a week or two. This is they they hit the ground with their running shoes on and uh made in China and they they're made to run uh and they keep them working and we're very very happy to be able to be behind and support in prayers and I want to ask this congregation every time they come across your mind you pray for them would you? &gt;&gt; The devil hates this message &gt;&gt; and we love it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's got people in his company that are very willing workers against it. And God has people in his company that are burdened people and are very willing, &gt;&gt; more than willing to give themselves. Amen. Uh, Brother David McAdams, God bless you. Brother David has been waiting some weeks to get things in order so he could come across the border. And we're so happy. And I was so happy, brother David, that you uh have that all fixed up and can be here in fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh for some of you that possibly have heard and others have not heard, but brother Lee Vale passed away. He passed away on Friday. He was 97. I was talking to brother Roger Smith some weeks ago and we thought that he might make 98. Uh he was in a wheelchair at this time rather weak but it's amazing how his mind remained so sharp. We're thankful for brother Vale's life. Thankful for the labor, the time he spent to put the church age book. How many have read the church age book? Lots of hands. And we we've we've enjoyed it. And uh in fact is I never forget you don't mind standing for a moment. I don't forget what brother Surl said about the church age book. He said it was it was one that he could he when he gave it to someone he knew that it had it encompassed the major doctrines of the godhead and the baptism and the serpent seed. it encompassed those major doctrines in such a way uh that it was it's really hard to escape and and I appreciated that. I thought of that each time I've read in the church age book and I've quoted from it many times and so we thank God for brother Veil's life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his contribution to this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. May God rest his his soul. All right, I think that Are we ready for the word? &gt;&gt; Let's just sing that. Of course, I'm amazed that he loved me. &gt;&gt; I'm amazed that he loved me. Yes, I [Applause] [Music] preious blood I have my [Music] way. [Music] Oh, [Applause] [Music] heat, heat. I [Music] see there wash away all my s. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Heavenly Father, we bow reverently, respectfully, &gt;&gt; and we're such a privileged people &gt;&gt; to be able to have come to know the living God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Whom to know is life eternal. &gt;&gt; We pray that you will take the human vessel, oh God in your hand and the human vessels, your body. Pray that you will take us, Father, and let your Holy Spirit brood upon us. Pray Lord you will take your word and just sink it down into the good ground of the soul. Let it bring forth ground. Let it bring forth fruit, Lord. I pray, Father, you'll bless this people. We thank you for this glorious testimony, Lord, of the defeat of the enemy for our sister Maria Rosales. Thank you, Lord. Our brother David McAdams is with us. We thank you for these various victories, Lord. and we pray that your name will be glorified here this morning. We are standing in your presence on holy ground. And now, Lord, let your word be quickened to us in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd like to read out of First Peter, the first chapter, and we're going to start reading at the 18th verse. I don't know if it's been your experience, but it has certainly been my experience. And I would appeal I appeal a great deal to the young people, young men, young ladies because of the I look upon you to have alertness of mind and retention and to see things from the perspective to be not only alert but to be perceptive to see where the Holy Spirit is seeking to bring us to because uh you can move into it &gt;&gt; and you don't have a bunch of baggage. You don't have all kinds of responsibilities. You're much more flexible &gt;&gt; and and and a congregation needs that &gt;&gt; and the other families and the older ones and mothers and fathers and elder we need that. &gt;&gt; We need that movement. We don't we don't need a bunch of dishes. We and not that you are, but uh we we need even more. I'd like to have a greater commitment from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. a greater commitment from the young people. &gt;&gt; Amen. To be very very committed to the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Uh be committed to the congregation, to the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the bride of Jesus Christ both here and abroad. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't don't just wait till you know somebody is, you know, spoon feeding you. No, no. Just take it and and and take and say, "I'm I'm stepping forward." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm in manhood now. I'm in womanhood and I'm stepping forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just show me the way and I'll do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. For as much as you know that you are not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ as a as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, who verily was fore orained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you. who by him do believe in God that raised him from the dead and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God. &gt;&gt; Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren. See that you love one another with a pure heart fervently. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 23, especially being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, &gt;&gt; by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. &gt;&gt; For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man, as the flower of grass, &gt;&gt; the grass witherth, and the flower thereof fallth away. Don't let's not forget that. &gt;&gt; But the word of the Lord endureth forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless his word as you have your seats. So now we just give you a moment get settled and have your minds focused. I want to uh bring you to this 23rd verse. being born again. You know, it's a phrase that everybody, it's a catchphrase. Everybody has it. Born again, born again. Uh the message really gives it a completely different depth &gt;&gt; and uh and uh I I've been the message has been something different for me in the last few years and even more so more increasingly potent &gt;&gt; and different. And I would really like to like to have your not only your full attention but uh that you will have and be in full expectation also as I am sir. &gt;&gt; Now there isn't anyone here that understands the you can understand perhaps the process of birth natural birth but we really don't understand it. It's it's called one of the greatest mysteries and and how a child is formed and and I was thinking this morning in the study while I was there how brother Brandham was saying and I said to the people down in South Carolina how he took all those cells of your body and those 100 trillion or so cells that you have. Brother Brandham takes it down. And he says, "Now, if we got if I take you down to one cell, &gt;&gt; just one cell." And he said, "I still can't find you. I still can't find you because somehow God by his spoken word pregnant, impregnated the seed of man that would come to a woman, there be a conception. we don't understand it. I wanted to say it that way. I want to say it very plainly because if we don't understand that how can we possibly comprehend that the instead instead of what God has placed in a man that comes to a woman instead of that God pregnant sounds called words and he pregnant that with a different kind of life. this life by this life you might live to 40 50 60 70 80 90 or as brother Devale was he was 97 that had very long life but this life is a diminishing life &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; we're going to go into that and but if we don't understand and somehow the world and I want to I want to try to succeed I've been very very moved to attempt to succeed in getting the people to understand the supernatural natural birth and when brother Brandham speaks about the genes about the cells and at the end of his life he just punched that home that you are a gene of God the same as you are a gene in your father you're a gene of God and somehow the churches and Satan I will say Satan in the church has kind of got you know h human existence as a reality and spiritual birth is some it's kind of some you know mystical foggy thing It's not foggy. &gt;&gt; It's more real than this one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Your eternal life is more real. And it's not something say, "Well, it's just so mysterious. I don't understand it." But you're sitting here in a body and your birth was totally mysterious. Your conception was completely mysterious. The prophet says, "Well, you start in the womb as a back as a backbone or a spine or something." I don't know how. &gt;&gt; I don't know how it was formed. I don't know how conception took place, but I do know one thing. It happened and I'm here. &gt;&gt; And the supernatural, the spiritual birth is exactly the same. &gt;&gt; And I was saying, I've been just saying it to my wife over and over to impress myself and impress her. The spiritual birth is as literal as the natural birth. &gt;&gt; And it's it's more real. It's more effective. And we do not want to keep it up in some mystical dream world. It's not a dream world. It's a reality. And I said, if the prophet said, "As you were a gene in your father and your greatgrandfather, so were you a gene in God." &gt;&gt; And it's and that gene in God is just as literal, &gt;&gt; more so literal, literal than the gene that was in your father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, let's just get that settled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to go back to the beginning when God had completed his creation. He looked upon it and he saw that it was very good. And the scripture says, "And God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day." listen to this uh description that brother Brandham gives in the rising of the sun and I want to read it because it's absolutely magnificent. It's to me it's just beautiful literature and so I just wanted to read it. He said there was a time when the world was laying in utter darkness. It was without form and was void. And it was all covered with water and was laying there in the dark, dismal, gloomy atmosphere. And the spirit of God moved upon that water and said, "Let there be light." God had a reason to do that, for down beneath that water there was seeds that he had planted, and it had to have the sunlight to make it live. And the first light that was ever given in the word earth was God's spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't forget that was the first light. God spoken word. The first light that ever struck the earth was God's spoken word. He said, "Let there be light." And there was light that turned darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the spirit of God as it moved with love and compassion at that great day, the first day of the dawn of the creation upon the earth, the sun rose and its rays swept across and dried up the waters from the earth and made an atmosphere above. And for its first time, it was to bring joy and life to the earth by a seed. That was a great hour. But oh, it wasn't nothing that sunrise like the sunrise on that Easter morning. This time with the sun leaping into the skies, it brought forth a greater uh sunrise than ever because it came greater news with this sunrise than it did with the sunrise at the beginning. This sunrise brought a news that he is risen. He is quickened from the dead as his promised. He's risen from the dead. &gt;&gt; The first time the sun rose in Genesis, it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the earth. Mortal life. &gt;&gt; But this time when the sun rose, there was a dual sun rising. Another sun rising. It was not only su n rising. It was a s o n had risen to bring eternal life &gt;&gt; to all God's promised seed that by fornowledge he seen laying upon the earth. &gt;&gt; No more could the botany life live back there at the beginning without the su n to bring it to life. No more than today when sons of god is upon the earth. It's take the s o n light to bring them to eternal life. &gt;&gt; This chose his chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world. He had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world. And on Easter morning, then in in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies. The body you're sitting in this morning &gt;&gt; laid in the earth &gt;&gt; when he rose out of the tomb. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And every son and daughter of God when he rose out of the tomb, there was a dual rising not only of the of the of the first res first uh creation when the sun came. But if this was a dual rising, I'd like to just add one thing to it because further on further on the message and other places, brother Brandham said, "You were in him at Calvary. You were in him in the resurrection." And so I want to say you were laying in the earth and God somewhere amongst humanity had a literal seed that was going to come on down on down on down on down until you sit in Cloverdale Bible way. But that same morning was a dual resurrection also because you were also in him who was the consequence or the result of the spoken word of God. For he was the fulfillment of the prophet's words and then those words were going to keep coming down down down until would come a spoken word in this time &gt;&gt; that would answer to that seed in you and give light to that seed and you would come to life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's the dual purpose. There's a mortal life and there's an eternal life. There's a first birth, your natural birth by which you die. And there's another birth, it's a literal birth by which you live. &gt;&gt; And one is mortal life and one's eternal life. And those two things happen to be such a reality. One is not a figment of your imagination. It's as real and more real than the body you're sitting in. And if we get that real, Satan doesn't want you to understand it that way. But God wants you to see it that way. You were a literal seed in him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He thought of you even in your present body. And he made a way for you to come here so you could be a witness of the truth because he knew that there would be a fall. He knew that there would be an enemy. He knew he had an enemy. And he knew that he was going to destroy this enemy. But he knew also that he was going to be expressed in the earth. &gt;&gt; We are the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the tree of life. He's still the tree of life. &gt;&gt; I would like you to think of the tree of life as the body of Jesus Christ. In his body, he came, he came being the spoken word of God. He came to be the sacrifice so he could pay you, pay for your redemption. And then his spirit then came and the spirit brooding upon the earth as it is even now. And I'd like you to see the body of Christ around the whole globe as the fibrous roots of the tree called the tree of life. &gt;&gt; And it's just gone and encompassed the entire earth in what we would know as believers of the message. And I don't know who all it's up to him where his roots go. But just the fibrous roots in the earth in this earth around the entire earth and bringing forth of the fruit of the bride tree. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a precious thing to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the Bible tells us from that time from the fall from the time of the fall when death came when death was introduced and came upon fallen man and all creation came under the sentence of death. Everything began to decay. Now if you went on to search on a computer and a Google or what whatever search engine you wish to use and you just put the decaying earth or decaying humanity or the decay of civilization, you won't have you won't live long enough to read it all. I didn't spend any time on it because I simply know from the scriptures that we are in a decaying dying civilization &gt;&gt; and you are faced with death everywhere. Death has permeated every corner and every part of humanity, every nation, every government, the best people and the worst people all are dying people. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There has to be a hope somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. We could say that something has seriously gone wrong &gt;&gt; when we look at what we see around us has gone wrong with creation. Creation's dying. And that's why the scripture says creation is groaning. The creation that a holy God looked upon and saw it as very good. Something has certainly changed because God looked again within a few generations. He looked again in the time of Noah. And the Bible says, "And God saw the wickedness of man, and it was great in the earth already, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually." And it says in verse 11, "And the earth also," that's Genesis 6:1, "and the earth also was corrupt before God." And I want you to hold that word corrupt for a moment. It was corrupt before God. And the earth was filled with violence. See, one follows the other. &gt;&gt; There's no anyone who thinks that there I'm going to manage, you know, I'm going to manage the evil part of my life. That's the biggest joke in the world. That's the biggest lie in the world. That's the biggest deception in the world. It's like saying, "I'm going to manage the devil. &gt;&gt; I'm going to manage evil powers. I'm going to manage that." You're not going to manage. They're going to manage you. &gt;&gt; Amen. If &gt;&gt; you don't have another, if you don't have a greater than he, greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world. You'll never manage that. &gt;&gt; And so it says that the earth was corrupt and to and the the word corrupt in the Hebrew is to destroy uh to go to ruin. It had already reached a place of ruin to decay to be spoiled or to pervert. And Satan had already with the increase of mankind. He had already spoiled and brought to ruin and brought to corruption, marred and spoiled the creation that God had created. And the scripture tells us now in 2 Timothy 3, we want to bring it forward to this time. Yay. And all that will live godly in Christ. All that will live godly in Christ. And I am certain that that's in your heart and that's why you're here. &gt;&gt; But the scripture says all who will live godly in Christ shall suffer persecution. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the persecution may not be a persecution of our own of our own thinking because it tells why it's persecution. It says, "But evil men and seducers &gt;&gt; shall wax worse deceiving and being deceived." &gt;&gt; I had someone say once, "Which is worse, being deceived or deceiving?" And they said, "Well, being deceived is worse because the one that's doing the deceiving at least knows he's doing wrong. He knows he's trying to deceive somebody and there might be hope for him. But if you're deceived, you you know, there's really no recovery because you think that it's right. &gt;&gt; That's what being deceived is. But one who's deceiving, he knows he's not right. &gt;&gt; He just trying to do someone else for some reason." But he says, and this is a and and and those that live godly will suffer persecution, but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. So it says evil men, &gt;&gt; evil men is ponderous in the Greek. It's full of labors, annoyances. uh evil men, men who annoy, hardships, pressed and harassed by labors of of a time of peril. Evil men speaks of a time of peril to Christian faith and steadfastness causing pain and trouble. These are troublesome times. And I see within a congregation, there's it comes from every direction. It may come from the political side. It may come from the educational side. It may come from the economic uh department or division. It may come whichever way it comes. But it's all one thing. It's because the world is decaying. &gt;&gt; And we're dealing with death. &gt;&gt; We're dealing with evil powers. We're dealing with evil men and seducers &gt;&gt; of the truth. Impostors. This. It says they're actually impostors. And s a seducer is is one. It's a strange thing. It's a juggler. &gt;&gt; Someone who juggles or an enchanter to delight and to fascinate and to charm. See, Satan doesn't come right up and said, "Ah, I'm bad." &gt;&gt; No, no. He says, "This is nice." &gt;&gt; He said, "Eve, look at the tree." &gt;&gt; And she got distracted. You heard me a couple Sundays ago. She got distracted. She was looking at the tree. It's a nice tree. It's pleasant. and it's it's uh you know it's it's good and it's good for food and it'll make you wise and all these things. She got distracted. It wasn't the tree he was interested. He wasn't interested in getting her to look at the tree. That was a distraction so he could seduce &gt;&gt; and have her disbelieve the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's the intent. Come on. &gt;&gt; And this troublesome and this weariesome and and all of these things come upon a per burdens and you know if he can't entice you he will do something else. &gt;&gt; See that's what he attempts to do. So he said it's it's of a time of peril to Christian to their faith and steadfastness. So I say to you in the name of Jesus Christ remain steadfast. &gt;&gt; Any of you had anything that even brought a little tremble or a little shaking deny it. know where it comes from. Satan wants to he if he can't rock you to sleep, he'll try to shake your roots. &gt;&gt; But when he shakes your roots, just say, "Praise God, I will let them go further down." &gt;&gt; This enchanter, a juggler, a seducer, to charm. But it is the intent is to mislead. &gt;&gt; A deceiver, an impostor. And an impostor is one who deceives by false pretenses. So it it's a it's an brother Brandham uses the word uses the word and he's not referring to any specific person but he he uses a word because you know there's a genuine that comes first an original that comes first and then there are others that come on behind it and they're not counterfeit as such that isn't the intent of them and I don't want to I'm just uh Brother Brandham used the word impersonators. &gt;&gt; And so he sees, you know, they see something says, "Oh, that works. I can do that." And but they're not appointed to it. &gt;&gt; They don't have a God- called ministry to it. And so they say, "Well, we'll duplicate this." But it's not a it's not a godscent word like that. &gt;&gt; All right. I hope you're just getting that. And then I'll continue with the scripture. Now he says, "But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived, but continue thou." &gt;&gt; And and the reason I took this, it says, "But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse." We're not talking about the Eden now. We're not talking about what happened there. That was the fall. That's where death was introduced. We're not talking about Noah's time. We're talking about our time. We've come all that distance. Listen, this is our time &gt;&gt; and there isn't a person here, but what you have some some burden or some weight that comes upon you because of the age and the time we're in. And don't let the devil just try to tell you, well, it'll be better tomorrow. No. As far as the as far as the believers concerned, uh what is happening, the decay will be even greater. &gt;&gt; It will wax worse and worse. &gt;&gt; Come on. In a few short years, I can tell you by my own personal testimony, in a short lifetime, I can't even hardly grasp I and my wife, we speak together, can't hardly grasp where the world has gone in one lifetime. &gt;&gt; And we say, "Where is it going to be by the time our our children or those that are in BCA in school or any other school, where is it going to be uh when they get up? when they get grown up. I want to say to this congregation, all that uh have a moment to hear on the internet, you remain steadfast. &gt;&gt; And that is what Apostle Peter is saying or Apostle Paul rather to Timothy. But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Know where this came from. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can tell you that what we're believing and what you have been heard and remain steadfast in has been something that has been vindicated. &gt;&gt; And we're not talking about vindication in some, you know, glossy type of way. But the vindication, friends, the vindication, I want to come to it in in a few moments, Lord willing. The vindication is actually the proof &gt;&gt; that it's the word &gt;&gt; of the second birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. hear that one. &gt;&gt; The vindication is the supernatural. I have been I have read a number of things and over the years, you know, have encountered people that have come against the message and they know all about the message and so they they get all the the the contradictions and and and the prophet of God said, "How could it be prophet? He said this and he said that and and so on and so forth." I'm coming directly against that thing because the one thing these men never do, they never come to the vindication. Said, well, he said this to this person and it was false. They never will come to it because that devil is scared of that &gt;&gt; because that in itself, that vindication is the spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; And that is God giving his proof that this is not the word of a man, but it is the word of almighty God. And that word is the same one who said, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there was &gt;&gt; there was &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In him was life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When that word became a man. &gt;&gt; In him was life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was in him? &gt;&gt; Say it again. &gt;&gt; No death. &gt;&gt; No death. &gt;&gt; No decay. No corruption, only life. &gt;&gt; And it's still in him. &gt;&gt; And he was that spoken word of God that came into existence, the son of God. And from him came the spirit to give life to all the other seeds. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are here as those seeds. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that spoken word had to come in this end time so that something would register to the predestinated seed in you. That is the truth. &gt;&gt; Here is life. &gt;&gt; I have found life. &gt;&gt; In a decaying world, I have found life. [Music] &gt;&gt; Life has found me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even in the natural birth, you didn't find life. You didn't find conception. Life found you. &gt;&gt; Life brought you on the scene. &gt;&gt; And so thus, you're sitting here. Mortal life, decaying life in a decaying world, in a corrupting world, in an evil world, and one that is waxing worse and worse. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But in the midst of this darkness shines a greater light, &gt;&gt; a literal light. &gt;&gt; Not just some, you know, phenomena, not just something imaginary, not some illusion or delusion, a reality. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to you because it's the truth. And if you'll believe it, you'll become a participant of it. &gt;&gt; You'll find out that it's more real than this body you're sitting in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to hang on to that. &gt;&gt; And I addressed you young men, young ladies. You get a hold of that. It's more real than the body. You can pinch your body. It's not It's more real than that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you need it. &gt;&gt; You need it. You know why? This body you're sitting in is decaying. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. These cells won't work the way when you get a little older, they won't work the way they're working right now. and you'll find that out in such a short time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them. And verse 15, and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, you that are children, you young people, you young ones here right on the front seats, I'm going to address you just this moment. And that from a child, from a child, want all the young children watch me from a child. Apostle Paul is talking to you. You have known the holy scriptures which are able to make you wise &gt;&gt; unto salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Through faith which is in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say to everyone here without any hesitation the scriptures which you have heard from a child and now many of us are all at different stages of life. I heard them as a child and they're still work. &gt;&gt; You're half my age. You heard them as a child and they're still work. &gt;&gt; And generations have fallen silent and it worked for them. And I read their books and it still works for them and it works for me and it works for people half my age and it works for you. It works for teenagers. It works for everybody. Remain steadfast in the things you have heard and remember from where you heard them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In this meeting, I was speaking on a similar subject, some of these same things and speaking on the gene of God and and here a prophetist speaking about it and so on and so forth. And uh and there was a Baptist minister in the meeting. We had some nice audiences and visitors at every service. And there was a Baptist minister sitting over to this side and he just couldn't handle some of the things that are being said and but you know God was helping me and I was just able uh to punch one line after another after another and so he was mumbling something and so one of the deacons said you know having a problem with that and deacon and deacon told him he said because he came to me right after the meeting the deacon says just keep listening you just keep listening you just keep listening you know yeah and they walk around you know the deacon just walking around said you just keep listening listen to what he's going to say, you know. And and about that time, I says, "You never got this out of a Bible school." &gt;&gt; Shocked him. You never got this out of a theological seminary. It's come divine from Almighty God. &gt;&gt; And man, he just rocked back. &gt;&gt; He said to the deacon, he says, "Where does he get all these things?" &gt;&gt; People around you, they wonder where you got all these things. It's not just some outward appearance. It goes way beyond that. It's some that's down in the soul. Where did we get all these things? Remember from whence you learned them? &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, my mom told me this. Where'd she get it? My dad told me this. Where did he get it?" Well, I heard it in the in the church. Where'd he get it? &gt;&gt; That's the thing. Keep asking where it come from. Said, "Well, it came from a vindicated voice. It came from a supernatural voice." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. said things we don't understand. I didn't understand it. I didn't understand the birth. I didn't know anything about my birth. &gt;&gt; I just came into the world. &gt;&gt; I don't even know how they fed me. &gt;&gt; I know. One of the first things that I I was almost my mother thought I had died with double pneumonia. And I'm just laying there lifeless. And an old farmer type man, Holy Ghost man came in and and my my mother said, you know, I was in this state. He laid his hands on me and I was healed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And didn't even have damaged lungs after that. &gt;&gt; I say glory to God. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says about America. He says we wouldn't even have any America &gt;&gt; if there wasn't any Lord Jesus here to help us be America. &gt;&gt; And after after all he says the backbone of every nation is its morals. &gt;&gt; The backbone of any nation is its morals. &gt;&gt; He says and when the morals drop in a nation then the nation's gone. &gt;&gt; Motherhood broken. you just might as well fold up. All other nations have done it and ours is no exception. In God making his promise, he says that's what's the matter with America today. Back in 56, the morals of it is corrupted and gone. The very foundation &gt;&gt; the world is a again falling apart. He says now that's not only in America here, but that's all over the world wherever you go. And I say that's absolutely the truth. &gt;&gt; Strife and war and killing and people butchering one another. What kind of humanity is this? It's a fallen humanity. It's a decaying humanity. Our only hope &gt;&gt; is in the God of this word. And our only hope is to know to know and how thankful you ought to be that you ever heard this message because that's the only one that I know of or ever have heard of that's had such a powerful proof and vindication beyond all argument. &gt;&gt; I would call all any men who find something something that they think's an hour of the way, let them go out in their world and straighten it out first. Hallelujah. You talk about illusion or delusion. You talk about demons in flesh. It's on the streets of Vancouver, Bellingham, Seattle, or wherever you want to go. It's everywhere. &gt;&gt; I say, "Go and fix that up." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Leave me alone. &gt;&gt; I got a I got a messenger that spoke and declared the absolute truth &gt;&gt; supernaturally. and trace people's lineage back. &gt;&gt; You're not from this city. You're from another city. Where'd that come from? &gt;&gt; You're not from this town. I see you coming from the west traveling east. You're not from this city. You're not from this state. You're not from this country. Tells one man &gt;&gt; in conference with God. A doctor. &gt;&gt; You ought to listen to it. I mean, friends, I tell you, that other world, that other dimension is so close. It's so close to us. &gt;&gt; Father Brandon, get somebody begins to speak about doctors and how kind they are and how with tender hands they try to make life easier and better for people. You talk about understanding. You talk about being compassionate. You talk about being just understanding with with humans in in their suffering. And he said, "And doctors try to make things better for them." them. Then he goes on and preaches conference with God for about an hour and a half. And then they call a prayer line. It's about an hour and a half or more later. And the first man, you have to listen very close. First man, he says, "You believe it, doctor, don't you." Do you know what I can tell you and someday you'll find out? Brother Brown knew that before the service started. He knew that when he started talking about doctors and how kind he spoke about them. He knew that first man is going to be a doctor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know how I know? Because he says, "You know, you believe it, doctor, don't you?" Mhm. Mhm. Mother two. Mhm. You're not from You're not from this place. You're not from this city. You're not from this country. You come from Canada. Vancouver. But you're not from You're not from Vancouver. You're not from Canada. You come from Finland. Tell you what, when he got to that place, I just said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If he knows I'm not from this country and I'm not from this city and I'm not from this state and I'm from England, I'm from uh Finland, then he surely knows I came from eternity. &gt;&gt; I believe the same one says, "Then you came from the mind of God. Wouldn't you accept that? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you accept that? &gt;&gt; As thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; And in the mind of God, he thought of me in my in my mortal life. In the mind of God, he thought of me as a son of God, in my eternal life. &gt;&gt; And so, he sent a gene through the fathers and through the through humanity. Sent a gene all the way down that gave me a body so that he could come in with the Holy Ghost and express himself. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that would be his spoken word that would give life and light. &gt;&gt; And this body goes out and goes outside almost every morning. Say, "Where's the sun?" &gt;&gt; Don't be so quiet. You all do the same thing. &gt;&gt; We like the sun, don't we? Not too much, but we like some sun. in him says. So now we've talked about the corrupting part, but he said there's coming a kingdom whose founder, a city whose builder and maker is God, and these things has to give way. &gt;&gt; Everything of this corruption, everything that you're next to, everything, even some things that are really nice, you know, we don't want to go back. Okay, kids. I used to my my mom and dad they got a washing machine. A washing machine. They actually made machines. They invented machines that would wash clothes. So my mom didn't have to over the scrubboard, you know, like the I saw her do that. Then they got a washing machine, but it had a handle on the side and it was Armstrong &gt;&gt; and that was my job. Then as time went on, man got smarter and wiser and they invented one that would work by itself. And I could just look inside and see the thing go. Isn't this fantastic? And now they just throw all the clothes in a machine and zip zip and walk out and forget it. And they I said, "What's that? That's a dryer ready for another load." Oh, we've come a long ways. But outside in the midst of all of this, &gt;&gt; in the midst of all of this is trouble. &gt;&gt; In the midst of all this wonderment is a decaying world. &gt;&gt; But this same messenger is able to confirm to us with supernatural sign there's another one coming. &gt;&gt; And this one has to give way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul said it's waxing worse and worse. This one has to give way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you don't have to be part of the worse and worse. &gt;&gt; You can be part of the better and better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says the great sculptor, I'm going to try to watch my time. the great sculptor. When he seen the fall of his humanity or the fall of his masterpiece, he wasn't willing to leave it lay there face down and ruin. He went to work immediately &gt;&gt; to build it up again. He wasn't willing that it should perish, lay there like that in the in in all the time because he's God and he will not be defeated. So he went to work immediately and be to build again uh unto his own image a man. &gt;&gt; And then identified masterpiece said once again he's seen his own reflection when one man was born on the earth from the womb of a woman. Now I'm I'm taking this a little slowly. I have I have if I have time to come to it. Brother Brandham said some said some powerful uh staggering made some staggering statements very early in his ministry and you have to be mature to even hear it. He said, 'I saw his own reflection born on the earth from the womb of a woman. That was God's masterpiece. That man, that was God's masterpiece. It was the son of God, Jesus Christ. The reason he was because he was perfectly the word. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh. The word was made flesh. &gt;&gt; Now, I understand all of you that are here that the sperm was made flesh. That's not a stunning surprise. The sperm was made flesh and your mother ate of the things coming out of the earth and you began to form in a body of flesh and the sperm was made flesh. But this prophet says even if he got that first cell, that smallest cell, he still can't find you &gt;&gt; because you're more than a cell &gt;&gt; God the creator in the creation in the beginning in the first creation the one that fell he he pregnantated that sperm with cells, &gt;&gt; trillions, &gt;&gt; till your body would come and you're sitting here as a result of that. &gt;&gt; But God, that same God said, "Now I'm going to put my I'm going to put this eternal life that was mortal life and my enemy was able to deceive it." Amen. &gt;&gt; And my first son, Adam, fell. &gt;&gt; And by falling, death came. &gt;&gt; Corruption came. &gt;&gt; A world is going to decay. It's going to spoil. It's going to ruin. &gt;&gt; But I am I am the master. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am the author. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I'm going to speak another word. &gt;&gt; And this is eternal life. one that he can never deceive. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to put it into sounds &gt;&gt; in whatever language is spoken in. It will mean the same thing. &gt;&gt; And they will never be able to discover it and Satan will never discover it. I'm going to put my word of eternal life, my eternal life. I'm the author of life. I'm going to put it into sounds. I'm going to put it into word form. And that word was spoken by the prophets, not even in English or any of the languages we speak, I suppose. And the languages from the earliest time, they made sounds and they spoke word. But the thing was, there were people that believed it. &gt;&gt; Believe these men, &gt;&gt; believe these men. &gt;&gt; And out of their mouth came the seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And into the heart was a faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; And they believed it and the two met and there was a conception &gt;&gt; and the eternal life was born again. &gt;&gt; The man, the woman became born again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But now then this man, this eternal life man, Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, came as a result of that. He he w he he was not from a human sperm. Right. &gt;&gt; He was from the word of God. &gt;&gt; He was from the other side. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was from the spoken word. &gt;&gt; And the life that was infused in the spoken word lodged in the womb of Mary who believed that word and brought forth a son. &gt;&gt; And in him was life. &gt;&gt; No more decay, no more death, &gt;&gt; nothing to wax worse and worse, only to wax better and better. In him was perfection. In him was grace. In him were all the attributes. Am I speaking too loud? Is this all the truth? &gt;&gt; Do you believe it, friends? Do you believe it? You must believe it. [Music] &gt;&gt; This is the only way out of this corruption. There is no other way. Jesus said, "I am the way. &gt;&gt; I am the truth. And I am the life. No man comes to the father but by me. &gt;&gt; You must believe that. &gt;&gt; There's no other way. &gt;&gt; You'll go the way of the grave and you'll become a teaspoon of ashes. And where your spirit is, who knows? But God has made a way for you to come back to him. &gt;&gt; If you're a son and daughter of God, [Applause] &gt;&gt; they begin to build his masterpiece. And and there was a son, a man called Jesus Christ. And it says of him, and he said of himself, the prophet said, "He is the beginning of the creation." &gt;&gt; You heard me speak on it, but now I'm taking it further. He's the beginning. He's not just kind of a to replicate what happened in the beginning. No, &gt;&gt; this is a whole new beginning. This is a complete different Genesis. &gt;&gt; This is the beginning &gt;&gt; of eternal life. &gt;&gt; Eternal life has come back out of the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What God intended in the first place now has been restored. &gt;&gt; Has come back. The original has come back. &gt;&gt; You can't have two originals. &gt;&gt; The first creation fell, &gt;&gt; right? and the and and and the author of the first creation has began a a an a creation, a beginning of what he intended. That's why he's called the second Adam. &gt;&gt; He's the beginning of the creation of God. And how could God be created that he is a spirit? How could he be? He's eternal. He never was created. He never will be created because he was God at the beginning. But he that is the beginning of the creation of God was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The man Jesus Christ was the beginning of the creation of God. Do we accept that? &gt;&gt; We need to accept that &gt;&gt; in a simplicity when he was made manifest when God lived in him. &gt;&gt; He said he's God's creation. You accept that? The first, the last, the amen, the beginning of the creation of God. When God created himself a body, he came down and lived in it. And that's the beginning of the creation of God. When God created himself a body and came down and lived in it, that's the beginning of the creation of God. In him was life. It says in John 1:4, "And the life was the light of man." Life, no death. The incorruptible seed &gt;&gt; came from the bosom of the father. &gt;&gt; The beginning of the new creation came from an eternal life resource. &gt;&gt; And in him, now hang on to this. In him was the literal seed of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he came out of the bosom of the father, it was a literal seed. And now this had to be somehow transferred through the process of redemption. Transferred to you. &gt;&gt; Your body still laying on the earth. Just elements of the soil. &gt;&gt; Just elements of the soil. &gt;&gt; But it was going to come forth somehow. And if God didn't know that you were going to be here, then who does? &gt;&gt; God knew you were going to be here. God knew exactly every footstep. &gt;&gt; Amen. There isn't anything that surprises him. &gt;&gt; And the only way that you can be a son or daughter of God, this is things that are to be one of the last messages that he spoke because you have eternal life. The only way that you can be a son or daughter of God because you have to have eternal life. &gt;&gt; And there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life. &gt;&gt; Amen. We accept that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We believe that &gt;&gt; only one form of eternal life. He said that was God. &gt;&gt; That was to be a son of God. You had to be in him always. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's eternal life. &gt;&gt; And the gene of your father, the gene of your life, the spiritual life tonight was in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was in God the Father before there was even a molecule. &gt;&gt; I I say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you are nothing but the manifestation. You are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a son of God. &gt;&gt; I want to emphasize that. &gt;&gt; I want you to memorize that &gt;&gt; you are nothing but the manifestation &gt;&gt; of the gene of God. &gt;&gt; You should say that to yourself. I am the manifestation of the gene of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was in God as a son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or a daughter of God. And you're expressed after his word has come into you to light up this age. &gt;&gt; John said further, "At that day, you shall know that I am in my father and you in me and I in you. I was surely with him. The prophet says, I was surely in him at Calvary. I must be identified with him at Calvary. &gt;&gt; I was there when he died. &gt;&gt; I died with him. &gt;&gt; And then I was with him when he raised up from the dead. Now listen friends, this is I was preaching and I was almost beside myself and you sometimes you say things and you have to think back about what you said after it was all through. But I came to this point while I was in South Carolina and what actually inspired this message to me is that this seed this he was incorruptible. &gt;&gt; He could not be corrupted. He could never become a part. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, he aged." Yes, he aged. He deteriorated &gt;&gt; as his body. But when the disciples came to the tomb, that body was not there. &gt;&gt; And that's what was surpris the tomb was empty. &gt;&gt; That body was not there. And so it had gotten older, &gt;&gt; but something happened. Something transpired and men and women both witnessed. He's not there. &gt;&gt; This body has changed. &gt;&gt; The incorruption, the incorrupt, it could not be corrupted. &gt;&gt; The corruption. And that's why Apostle Paul says this corruption must put on incorruption. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're in a decaying world and you're sitting in bodies. I don't care how young you are, how strong you are, how beautiful you are, how anything you are. You are in a you're in a corrupting state. &gt;&gt; But this corruption must put on incorruption. And that cannot just be a nice phrase. We say, "How how does that happen?" It happens because God sends a word. God sends a word to those that are predestinated and they believe that word. &gt;&gt; I don't know how. &gt;&gt; I don't I can't understand it, but I believe it anyhow because there's something inside that has come from a divine resource that says that is the truth. &gt;&gt; That says to me that's your only way out. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've read of accounts of people that have come into into just disastrous situations, catastrophic happenings on Earth, and and something has happened, and they they find within themselves a a resource of strength, and they call it adrenaline, a rush, or whatever it was, but they go and leap over a wall. They go and do some things that normally would kill a human and they save themselves &gt;&gt; and they say afterward, "I don't know how it happened. I don't know what happened. I don't even know what overcame me, but I just I just found a resource of strength and I just went and did it." That was They never knew they had it even in this human body. But you have it in there. &gt;&gt; But you have something else in there. If you're called as a son and daughter of God, God has put a He's put a something in you. It is his own word. It is a seed. Brother Brandham calls it a seed. Well, I don't understand it. I don't try to understand it. I just know it's there. &gt;&gt; And that is why when I still hear what they call it discernment. I don't call it discernment. I don't even I the prophet said it's not discernment. He said the word of God is quick and powerful &gt;&gt; and sharper than any two-edged sword. What is it? Say it to me. Word of God. &gt;&gt; What is it that's sharp and powerful? &gt;&gt; Word of God. &gt;&gt; The word of God. &gt;&gt; The word of God. &gt;&gt; Is it English? Is it Hebrew? Is it what? I don't care what it is. It's the word of God. &gt;&gt; Whether he thought it, whether he intended it, whether he spoke it, or how he said it, or what sound he used is irrelevant to me. God pregnant sound &gt;&gt; and he let his thought come out into some process. And I don't try to figure out the process. All I know it was in the mind of God. A prophet told me it's in the mind of God. And the word of God is a is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. And I heard a sound. I heard a word. It was something that spoke to me as a young man in my teens. And I I knew it was God. Hallelujah. And when I heard this messenger begin to speak and even to this day, 60 years later, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. I'm still moved exactly the same way because I'm I'm I'm hearing a voice from my own beginnings. &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, those beginnings are true. &gt;&gt; I can say it more powerfully today because I have proven it. &gt;&gt; I proved it in my 20s. I proved it when we were married. I proved it raising a family. This God is God. &gt;&gt; This is his word. &gt;&gt; Don't you ever be afraid to believe it. Don't you ever be afraid to commit your all to it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This will help you out of your dilemma. This world, don't forget this world is corrupting and you came into it in a corrupting birth and by the woman we die. But by this man, the masterpiece Jesus Christ who returned back to the spoken word of God. By that word, we live. &gt;&gt; And it can penetrate between the spirit and the soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is more than emotion. Even though I'm an emotional person, it's more than emotion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's more than excitement. &gt;&gt; It's more than a theory. &gt;&gt; It's a gene of God. &gt;&gt; It's a reality. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And when it comes into your being, you know that you're a new creature in Christ Jesus. Old things have passed away. And don't ever be don't ever let it become crowded and clouded over with this life. &gt;&gt; This life's a passing life. &gt;&gt; Don't ever forget it. This life is a life of darkness. &gt;&gt; This life is a is a decaying life. &gt;&gt; And when he came out of the grave, sir, &gt;&gt; you were there. &gt;&gt; Every son, every daughter were there in that tomb &gt;&gt; with him. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when you were there &gt;&gt; and corruption was trying to set in, &gt;&gt; but you could not be corrupted. [Music] &gt;&gt; Why doesn't somebody yell hallelujah? &gt;&gt; You couldn't be corrupted. &gt;&gt; And if you couldn't be corrupted in the tomb, you won't be corrupted now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say that with all authority. Amen. &gt;&gt; If Satan could not corrupt me in the tomb, &gt;&gt; then he cannot corrupt me in this life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For the same life dwells in me. &gt;&gt; And no wonder the prophet could say, "We rose with him." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We rose with him. Why? Because corruption couldn't claim our bodies. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And I have a sign sealed document. They can lay you in the tomb. They can bury you in the sea. They can burn you at the stake and become just gases. But that word of God will call those elements back again. And you'll stand in the presence of God because God the creator said, "You're my son. You're my daughter. And you're going to stand in my presence." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And my enemy, my enemy can never never defeat that purpose. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So you were there when he came out of the tomb. &gt;&gt; You were there when he crushed. Said, "Well, the devil this, the devil that." Hey, let me let me just fix that once and for all. &gt;&gt; You were in him when he crushed the devil's head. You were there participating. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, I don't understand. I don't remember it." You don't remember anything in your mother's womb. You don't remember anything when you were born. You don't remember anything while she was feeding you for the first few months. &gt;&gt; Didn't you have a mind? Well, well, yeah. I I guess I had a mind. Well, how come you don't remember it? I don't know. &gt;&gt; How come you can't figure it out? How did it happen? I don't know how it happened. Well, then forget it. &gt;&gt; But you believe it. Yeah, I have to believe it. I'm here. That's the same thing spiritually. I received eternal life and it was a it was a clearer birth than this birth. &gt;&gt; And it's a better life than this life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you were in him. A vindicated prophet said it. And that proven that proven word, that supernatural word, not a gift is a supernatural word. Amen. &gt;&gt; These people are trying to say, "Well, brother Ben Brandom used a gift." Listen, it's more than a gift. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are you ready for it? &gt;&gt; When he was when he was doing that, when he was doing what they call a first pull, he was actually demonstrating the proof of your life. &gt;&gt; You say, "How so?" Because that was the seed. &gt;&gt; Listen, how many times they say, "Would it help you to believe?" Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why did he want the people to be helped to believe? Because by helping them to believe, they come to life. &gt;&gt; If you believe, &gt;&gt; do you believe, young people? Do you believe? &gt;&gt; Do you believe, young man? Do you believe? &gt;&gt; I'm putting you on the spot. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; So shall it be. &gt;&gt; It's done. &gt;&gt; It's done. Is more than a song. &gt;&gt; It's more than a course. It's already done. &gt;&gt; You believe it, friends. There'll be nothing in this world. This world is a world of corruption. But you have come from an incorruptible source. &gt;&gt; You came out of the bosom of the father with him. And he could not be corrupted. [Music] &gt;&gt; For thou will not leave his soul in hell. Not only him, but every seed, every every cell that was in him. &gt;&gt; If God wouldn't leave your soul in hell or the grave back then, &gt;&gt; how do you ever expect he'll cast you into hell now? &gt;&gt; We've passed &gt;&gt; from death unto life. My brother, my sister, I'm going to preach till every doubt is nailed to the wall. &gt;&gt; It was nailed at the cross. &gt;&gt; Don't you think for a moment this is too strong? You need every ounce of this strength &gt;&gt; and you need more. &gt;&gt; You pray for the preachers that they will come with the full uh the full uh demonstration and the full expression of who you are in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's true. &gt;&gt; We all know what we aren't. &gt;&gt; We all know our failures. &gt;&gt; But when we pray, see who you are. &gt;&gt; You see that devil who's been hounding you &gt;&gt; as a defeated foe. &gt;&gt; Writhing with a crushed head &gt;&gt; and you realize I was in my Lord Jesus, the masterpiece when he crushed his head. &gt;&gt; I was in him at Calvary. I was in him in the tomb. I am the beginning of the new creation. And you can say, I'm part of the new creation. And the word of God says, I'm a new creature in Christ Jesus. Old things, old things, corrupting things, hallelujah, have passed away. &gt;&gt; And behold, all things are new. &gt;&gt; Not all things are band-aided. Not all things are patched up. Not all things we somehow deal with it. No, all things are new. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Why do you preach like that, Brother Ed?" "Because it's the only way out for me." &gt;&gt; And it's the only way out for you. &gt;&gt; It's the only way out for the future. &gt;&gt; You have to believe it. &gt;&gt; You have to believe it. &gt;&gt; So, I believe that beyond my understanding, I believe that because I believe where it's coming from. &gt;&gt; This is not something from brother Biscll's mind. This is not even something from William Brandham's mind. This is something from the mind of almighty God and sent his proofs continually his proofs so that the people who would hear could say it's God speaking. [Music] &gt;&gt; And then there are many that want to say, "Well, it wasn't God. He said this. They said that and it didn't happen." Well, let's go to all the places it did happen. &gt;&gt; Who then was speaking? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what, I almost feel like dancing &gt;&gt; down in South Carolina. Brother Roy, they were dancing. &gt;&gt; And I just let them dance. They came right up to the front and they just had a hallelujah time. Glory to God. Just go to it, fellas. &gt;&gt; Have a great time. &gt;&gt; Two sisters got up and just had a jig together. &gt;&gt; What kind? I don't know. wasn't invented in the corrupting world. &gt;&gt; It was something divine. I just let him rejoice. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close in just a few minutes. &gt;&gt; The beginning. The beginning. I want you to get this now. is the first version. It's the first or unique item from which copies or alternative versions are made, &gt;&gt; the original or the first version. The beginning is the start. Jesus said, "I'm the beginning." And he tells John the apostle, "Tell the seventh messenger, thus saith the true and faithful witness, &gt;&gt; I'm not untrue. I'm true &gt;&gt; and I'm faithful." &gt;&gt; What I said, I will do. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The beginning. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Tell the messenger, the seventh messenger, the last one, the prophet messenger, not a reformer, a messenger who I will speak the truth and I will give him the proof. &gt;&gt; In abundance, &gt;&gt; it'll be such a tidal wave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll be a an a tsunami of evidence &gt;&gt; and it'll be in private. It'll be in the interviews. It will be everywhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; It will be amongst the hundreds of thousands. It'll be when there's just a few orund or two sitting on a log. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have three three questions in your heart. Not three and a half or four. Three. That's exactly what I had. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Who is that? That's the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's not a man looking into my face trying to read. He said, "You think I'm reading your mind? That's not reading your mind. I caught that thought. &gt;&gt; Who is that? The same Lord Jesus Christ that walked here on earth. The masterpiece [Music] &gt;&gt; and the word &gt;&gt; became flesh. &gt;&gt; Not sperm became flesh. The word became flesh. &gt;&gt; I think you'll never forget that &gt;&gt; the word was made flesh. The Bible says made flesh. Process. I don't know. &gt;&gt; I don't even know the process of the sperm being made flesh. &gt;&gt; But this is and that was but I I I believe it because you're here &gt;&gt; and I'm here &gt;&gt; and we accept it. &gt;&gt; We just believe it. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; You have believed unto mortal life. &gt;&gt; Now, how about the other one? &gt;&gt; I want you to believe it. I want you to see it. I want you to glorify God in it. You were a gene in almighty God. Not just some mind thought. &gt;&gt; No, not just a thought like you think, but a thought that became substance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that thought remained in the word when he was made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus went to the cross thinking of you. No wonder the songwriter said, uh, I was in his mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he was on the cross, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; In a literal form. Amen. &gt;&gt; How literal God knows even the number of the hairs of your head. &gt;&gt; How's that one? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that one? &gt;&gt; If he knows the number of the hairs of your head. And as the prophet of God said, he didn't lose any of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Everyone who's lost hair and I'm losing a lot myself. I just have to rejoice. &gt;&gt; I will say what the messenger did. Haven't lost one. &gt;&gt; Haven't lost one. &gt;&gt; Brother Mike, haven't lost one. Hallelujah. He's rejoicing. Brother Sam, are you rejoicing? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We haven't lost one. &gt;&gt; They're all coming back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's a reality. &gt;&gt; We haven't lost one. He knows He knows the number of our hairs of our head. What about our problems? Does he know your problem? Does he know your difficulty? Oh, forget it. He knows every detail of it. &gt;&gt; Is he interested in you? He carth for you. &gt;&gt; Believe that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, does your wife care for you? Does your husband care for you? Does your mother or father care for you?" I know that they do, but you know, there's a limit to what they can do, but there's no limit to what he can do. &gt;&gt; And you must believe on him &gt;&gt; and hold steadfast, &gt;&gt; knowing from whence you received it. Lord. &gt;&gt; And so the beginning is the point in time. Oh, is the point in time or space at which something starts comes into existence. Brother Brandham said God thought of himself as being human &gt;&gt; and that materialized him. Glorious. &gt;&gt; Marvelous statement. You don't even have to understand it. &gt;&gt; God saw you here in a body &gt;&gt; of flesh. &gt;&gt; Said, "I'm going to come to them. I'm going to send my spirit into them." &gt;&gt; They're going to be born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of eternal life seed. &gt;&gt; They're going to have eternal life because that's the only life I have. And I'm just going to let them know that they've always existed. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, that goes way beyond me." Well, I'm glad it does, cuz if you could figure it out, I wouldn't want it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If I can figure it out, I don't want it. &gt;&gt; I want something I can't figure out. I want to believe it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My time is slipping away, but there's so many things that we we don't understand. You've all heard the word arch or arc, whichever way. uh brother uh Aras Toms I believe it was he was the pastor who was pastoring in Victoria when we had brother Brandham come over there he was the one who invited brother Brandham and sponsored the meetings in Saskatoon Saskatchewan 1947 Toms and he was pastor of the apostolic church where we attended a short time and he was he was he was himself British on your size, brother Frank. So he called the archbishop. The archbishop was where the queen always went to Christ Church Cathedral, you know, because there has to be a lot of, you know, lydah. Everything has to be just right. when the queen goes to church. So whenever she's in Victoria, it might be decades, but when she's there, she goes to Christ Church Cathedral. And uh and there has to be an archbishop there. So brother Tom's had some reason to call. And brother Tom, he was quite quick. Oh, hello. He says, "Is this the bishop?" And the phone just went silent. And he hears the archbishop. Don't forget the arch part, the archbishop because that's the first. That's the beginning. That's the highest. &gt;&gt; The arch. Well, the arc archangel appears twice in the Bible. Just twice. and the ark angel. It says, "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout &gt;&gt; who himself [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord himself &gt;&gt; shall descend from heaven with a shout." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The shouts the Lord himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With the voice &gt;&gt; of the archangel. &gt;&gt; Don't forget arch here. This is the archangel. &gt;&gt; Hello. Are you an angel? &gt;&gt; The archangel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the Lord himself &gt;&gt; with the voice of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the trump of God. &gt;&gt; And that's the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's the rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We had to have the kind of profound &gt;&gt; uh absolute proofs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It had to come in this generation. All children of this age, children of the rapture, children of this uh generation of the seventh age, children who experience these things. Who have ever who ever heard who ever heard anything? Who heard about Revelation 10:1 and another mighty angel? Who ever put that together with Thessalonians? &gt;&gt; You are so privileged. &gt;&gt; You don't have to figure it out. It's just what the Bible says. Amen. &gt;&gt; And who is he coming to? &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; I know I got here in mortal life. He was coming to you. &gt;&gt; You were ordained to hear it. &gt;&gt; I don't care how you heard it. I don't even try to figure that out. I don't I don't know how come, you know, all the millions of cells that were, you know, there and finally, bang, one hits and and it's you. And brother Bradam even describes that. He says it's not the first one. &gt;&gt; So there's a whole bunch died &gt;&gt; even in that sperm so you could live. &gt;&gt; It might have been one right at the back of the wall &gt;&gt; right the back of the egg &gt;&gt; and it just wiggles its way through and bangs into this one into that one. This one's you know this one's a certain features and whatever more. I won't go into that. And then bang, it hits one. Conception took place. Figure that one out. I don't know. But here the gospel came down and millions were destroyed and millions were martyed and 168 million and but the word kept coming down. &gt;&gt; The seed kept coming. You couldn't stop it. Oh, are you with me friends? &gt;&gt; Until you would come here on the scene in natural life. And God in his mind said, "I ordained that one to be there. Now I'm going to move on somebody. I'm going to move on a preacher to preach. I'm going to move on a neighbor to give him a book. I'm going to move on somebody to say something. &gt;&gt; I'm going to move say on Jonathan Largo just to walk by a girl in the in the in the walkway of the university say it wasn't an apple." Hello. That wasn't a very big message, was it? She wasn't an apple. Today she's his wife. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Quite a message, wasn't it? &gt;&gt; No, it was a seed laying there. &gt;&gt; Bang, something happened. Wasn't an apple. My goodness. What even caused it? Hallelujah. She became a wonderful, wonderful believer &gt;&gt; and a wonderful wife.
