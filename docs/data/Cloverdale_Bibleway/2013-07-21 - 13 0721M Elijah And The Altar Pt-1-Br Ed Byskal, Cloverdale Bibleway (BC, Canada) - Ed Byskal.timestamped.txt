[14:20] word of prayer. We do have a [music] few
[14:22] prayer requests we want to remember.

[14:31] infection in his left leg and he needs a
[14:32] touch from the Lord at this time. And
[14:35] also our brother Andy Wymer just asking
[14:37] that we would please remember him in
[14:39] prayer. He's lost the first half inch of

[15:09] he's starting chemotherapy this Tuesday.
[15:12] God's already moved on his behalf in a
[15:15] supernatural way. They can't find
[15:17] [music] any cancer, but doctors want him
[15:19] to go through the chemotherapy. And
[15:20] we're just asking that the Lord would
[15:22] give him strength during it and give him
[15:23] a complete healing and that he would not
[15:25] be just completely out of commission
[15:27] during it. Amen. [music] So, if there's
[15:29] something on your heart, maybe just as

[17:46] This is what we live for.
[17:49] Where would we be but for the grace and
[17:51] mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ? Each one
[17:54] of us, Lord, we think about it often,
[17:56] Lord, where we could be if you didn't
[17:58] keep us. You didn't choose us. You,
[18:01] Lord, we thank you for that, Lord. And
[18:02] this morning, Lord, that blood never
[18:06] loses its [music] power, Lord. These
[18:08] needs that were mentioned, Lord, we know
[18:10] that you knew each situation and you
[18:12] know the end result of each one, Father.
[18:15] So Lord, we commit each one Lord. Hayes
[18:19] brother, Lord, we know it's serious.
[18:20] Lord, we pray you'll come by our

[18:23] do in these situations, Lord. And each
[18:26] of us, Lord, we have our hands raised,
[18:28] Lord. [music] There's burdens, there's
[18:29] desires, there's needs that we have
[18:31] pressing on our hearts and looking to
[18:33] you, Lord, for the answer [music]
[18:34] because you're the only one that has the
[18:36] answer in these situations, Lord. And we
[18:38] trust it to you, Lord. And Father, we
[18:41] commit this day the word, Lord. We know
[18:44] our pastor, Lord, has labored and looked
[18:46] to you, Lord. And you give him a thought
[18:48] direct from the throne of God. And Lord,
[18:51] we will take it from you, [music] Lord.
[18:53] Bless our brother, Lord. We love him and
[18:55] appreciate him, Lord. And Father,
[18:57] there's so many things going through our
[18:58] hearts and our minds, Lord, but we
[19:00] commit them to you, Lord. Each one,
[19:02] Lord. We're so thankful, Lord, that we
[19:04] have this place to [music] come to,
[19:06] Lord. Would you also just bless the
[19:07] offering, Lord? Lord, you know each one
[19:10] what they can and cannot do. And Lord,
[19:12] we've just seen the track record, Lord,
[19:13] of how you've used, Lord, the ministry
[19:16] and our pastor, Lord, to direct these
[19:17] funds, Lord, and used them around the
[19:20] world, Lord, to so many fruits and so
[19:22] many lives that have been affected
[19:24] because of it, Lord. So, Lord, we commit
[19:26] all that said and done this day into
[19:27] your hands. And we thank you for this
[19:29] privilege and opportunity to be here,
[19:31] Lord, in your name. Amen. [music]
[19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe just as they take up the
[19:40] offering, why don't we sing? Heavenly
[19:41] Father, I appreciate you. [music]
[19:48] Heavenly Father, you may have your
[19:50] seats. [music] Appreciate

[27:06] could take the sin [music]
[27:09] and darkness from [singing]
[27:12] me.
[27:14] [music]
[27:17] and know how much he [music] cares
[27:21] for me. Just once again, no one ever
[27:25] cares for me. No, [music] no one ever
[27:30] cared for me [music]
[27:34] like Jesus.
[27:38] And there's [music and singing]
[27:40] no other
[27:42] friend so [music] high
[27:46] as he
[27:51] no one [music] else [singing]
[27:53] could take the sin and [music] darkness.
[28:03] [music]
[28:04] Oh, how much he cares [music]
[28:09] for me.
[28:14] [music] Amen. One more announcement I
[28:16] forgot to make from brother Matthew
[28:18] Redell. There will be an outre out
[28:19] outreach and witness in Bellingham next

[28:24] like to attend, please see or call

[28:27] for all the details. Amen. God bless
[28:29] Matthew.

[33:56] [singing]
[34:06] [applause]
[34:08] Our pastor comes. I've just had on my
[34:11] heart to sing number 464 for a couple
[34:14] weeks now. And we don't usually sing the
[34:17] verses, but I've just felt that it would
[34:20] be beneficial to us. So, you're welcome
[34:21] to sing along. [music] Amen. The anchor
[34:24] holds you. We found it to be so. Amen.
[34:27] Maybe just as we prepare to turn to the
[34:28] word now, we can sing this.
[34:34] [music]
[34:40] I [music]
[34:42] have journey
[34:45] [music]
[34:47] through the long dark night
[34:55] [music] out on
[34:57] the open
[35:00] sea. [music]
[35:08] By [music] faith alone,
[35:14] [music]
[35:15] sight [singing] unknown.
[35:19] [music]
[35:22] And yet his [singing] eyes
[35:26] [music]
[35:26] watching me.
[35:32] The [music] anchor [singing]
[35:35] holds
[35:37] [music]
[35:39] though the ship is better.
[35:43] [music]
[35:45] Oh yeah.
[35:53] The sails are [music]
[35:55] tall
[35:59] and I [singing]
[36:01] have fallen [music] all my knees
[36:07] as I [singing] face the raging [music]
[36:12] seas.
[36:13] the anger
[36:15] of hope
[36:18] [music]
[36:20] in spite [singing]
[36:21] of the storm.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I've [singing]
[36:32] had visions
[36:34] [music]
[36:37] and I've [singing]
[36:38] had dreams [music]
[36:44] and I've [singing] even held it
[36:48] in my [music] hands.
[36:57] But [music] I never knew.
[37:02] [music] Then they would slip right
[37:05] [singing] through.
[37:09] [music] Oh, like they [singing] were
[37:12] only
[37:14] brings the sand. [music]
[37:18] Oh, praise the Lord, the anor.
[37:20] [music and singing]
[37:26] All of the sin
[37:29] is [music]
[37:30] matter.
[37:33] I know the [music]
[37:36] wall.
[37:40] for the sail.
[37:42] [music]
[37:46] And I [music and singing]
[37:49] have fallen
[37:51] on my knees [music]
[37:55] as I [singing] face the raging
[37:59] seas. The [music] anger holds.
[38:06] for spite
[38:09] of [music] the storm.
[38:16] Oh, [music]
[38:17] and I have been young,
[38:22] but I am [music] older [singing]
[38:25] now.
[38:29] Oh, when [music] there has been beauty
[38:34] these eyes [singing] have seen. [music]
[38:41] [music]
[38:42] But it was in [singing]
[38:44] the night
[38:48] through the [music] storms of my life.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; [music]
[38:55] &gt;&gt; For that's where God proved
[38:58] his love
[39:00] to me. [music]
[39:02] Amen. While we stand, let's sing it. The
[39:05] anchor [singing]
[39:08] hold
[39:09] [music]
[39:11] the [singing] savior
[39:16] [music]
[39:17] and the anchor.
[39:23] all [music]
[39:24] the sins I
[39:31] [music]
[39:32] have
[39:34] on my knees
[39:38] that [music and singing] I
[39:40] praise
[39:42] is the endless
[39:46] [music]
[39:50] [singing]
[39:52] soul. [music]
[39:54] This day once again is a testimony.

[41:07] steadfast and sure.
[41:10] We thank you for this congregation of
[41:12] people. [music] Lord, we thank you for
[41:13] the testimony.
[41:15] We thank you for the witness of [music]
[41:17] the Holy Spirit. Oh, God.
[41:20] These these things are true. Your word
[41:23] is true. Your promises are yay and amen.
[41:27] And we have proven and tested them over
[41:30] time. And we can say [music] so. And we
[41:33] say collectively,
[41:35] glory to our God. [music]

[41:49] in our lungs and words upon our lips,
[41:52] words of praise. Glory be to the Holy

[41:59] &gt;&gt; Bless your name,
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Lord. We pray that you will take this
[42:03] time that we set aside. This is your
[42:06] day,

[42:24] we pray. [music]
[42:26] Speaker and hearers alike, all that are

[42:35] pray you'll bless, oh God, the saints in
[42:38] Africa, in China, in India, South
[42:41] America, and don't forget us here, Lord.
[42:45] How we need you. [music] We pray, oh
[42:48] God, that in this very wicked time,
[42:50] you'll remember us. And we know that you
[42:53] have shine upon us, oh God, with your
[42:56] glorious light. [music] We shall rise
[42:58] and shine for the glory of God has shone
[43:02] upon us. And now, Father, your will be
[43:05] done in this service in Jesus Christ's
[43:07] name. [music]
[43:08] Amen.
[43:10] Amen.
[43:13] Thank you, brother Ryan. That was just
[43:15] perfect.
[43:17] God bless you. Amen.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Those you that may be visiting,
[43:24] [clears throat] perhaps you're not
[43:25] visiting, you may be here by divine
[43:30] order.
[43:31] We believe that this is God's plan for
[43:34] us to be here. So, he has something in
[43:36] mind for us.
[43:39] I want to say to all of you who were
[43:44] in the wedding yesterday,
[43:47] uh not well yesterday, but Thursday, it
[43:49] seems like yesterday to me. Uh I just
[43:53] want to thank the congregation. I'd like
[43:54] to
[43:56] uh thank the families, the Andes and
[43:59] Caldwell family. Uh I I want to say
[44:03] something about the wedding. It was it
[44:06] was spiritual.
[44:09] There was nothing frivolous.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; It was divine. It was it was just
[44:15] sacred.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; And I thought it was an honor to God to
[44:20] have that kind of a ceremony. And you
[44:22] that uh ever anticipate marriage, I
[44:26] would make that as an example.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Have a godly,
[44:30] holy, something that God is pleased
[44:33] with.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:35] And so I want to thank the congregation.
[44:37] I want to thank you all. Thank you young
[44:40] people that were there present.
[44:44] Uh it's very very much in keeping with
[44:47] the service this morning the comments
[44:50] that I made. Uh I said and I would just
[44:55] remind you and for those of you that
[44:56] weren't there that brother Tim had asked
[44:59] me to make a few comments and uh take
[45:02] about 10 minutes
[45:05] and I said that after he had asked me at
[45:08] some time days later I was pondering
[45:10] just exactly what you know thought or
[45:14] looking to the Lord and kind of scanning
[45:16] the horizon the spiritual horizon for
[45:20] what he might have me to say. and and
[45:23] and a thought was inspired to me.
[45:26] [clears throat] So as I began to look
[45:27] into that here, it just expanded and if
[45:32] not exploded and I was I started to
[45:35] write and I started to make notes and
[45:37] then as I was doing that I realized that
[45:40] it was a message. It's the message I
[45:43] preached this morning. And so I just
[45:45] barely touched on it and and you'll
[45:48] maybe pick up a a thought or two as we
[45:50] go along, but it was uh this was
[45:54] inspired to me and I I thought how
[45:56] fitting it was that the young man asked
[45:59] me to say a few words and has such a
[46:02] deep respect and and uh I I felt an
[46:05] honor to be able to say a few words and
[46:07] then as I'm looking to God to say
[46:09] something here here a whole Sunday
[46:12] morning comes out of it. And so I
[46:14] believe that that is of the Lord. And so
[46:17] those of you that are visiting, you're
[46:19] not really visiting. God ordained that
[46:21] you are here. And I I pray that those
[46:24] that aren't here will perhaps uh will uh
[46:29] feel a sense of conviction and want to
[46:32] be here. God bless you all. Are you
[46:34] happy?
[46:35] &gt;&gt; That's the main thing
[46:39] I would like to just say. our our
[46:41] brother George and sister Hope
[46:46] uh that are going back to Nigeria this
[46:48] week. We are going to miss you.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; We're going to miss the singing.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Brother George is a song leader at their
[46:59] church in Nigeria. And you can see
[47:01] that's why he he gets up. And so someone
[47:04] was asking uh brother George uh how how
[47:07] do you sing? And uh he has all those
[47:11] songs so ready because they sang. And he
[47:13] says, "Well, uh we clap a lot and we
[47:16] dance." [laughter]
[47:19] And that's just what you should have
[47:20] done right here. There'd probably be
[47:22] some that would join you and you might
[47:24] loosen up some of us Canadians and
[47:27] Americans and we could do that. Amen. I
[47:31] enjoy it. I've been in Africa enough. I
[47:33] just really love it. Thank you, brother
[47:35] George. and we're going to miss you and
[47:37] we love you and your family. Uh they're
[47:41] so lovely and come back soon, stay
[47:45] longer. [laughter]
[47:48] Amen.
[47:53] Uh there's been a number of people and
[47:55] we've had a request here and we have
[47:57] prayed for brother Marcus Becker. Uh,
[48:01] brother Marcus Becker is one of the
[48:02] associate ministers at brother Garrett
[48:04] Rodal's church and he had an accident
[48:07] with a chainsaw and he was off himself
[48:10] and you may have heard some of this but
[48:13] brother Hughes message has been in touch
[48:15] with uh the people back there because he
[48:18] spent time in Germany and speaks German
[48:20] and has been doing a lot towards further
[48:23] translations of the German messages. Uh,
[48:26] and we appreciate that. However, I wrote
[48:30] I had heard right away as the same
[48:32] source I think brother Hugh had and uh
[48:35] then I wrote brother Becker and I have a
[48:39] a note short note from his wife,
[48:42] [clears throat] but he was off in the
[48:45] woods uh by himself and had an accident
[48:49] with a chainsaw and almost cut off his
[48:52] hand at the wrist and cut the arteries
[48:56] and ligaments.
[48:58] And uh so he ma he was holding that and
[49:02] trying to phone and he managed to get a
[49:06] a phone call to someone who came and
[49:10] they got a helicopter and flew him to
[49:12] the hospital and have apparently they
[49:15] said everything went very well and he's
[49:18] he's able to get some movement in his
[49:20] fingers. We're thankful for that. And
[49:23] this is what uh sister Becker has said.
[49:27] Dear brother Biscll, very warm greetings
[49:29] from my husband. He will send you a note
[49:32] as soon as possible. He was very touched
[49:36] in his heart. Uh heard about your
[49:39] friendship and concern. The operation
[49:42] went very well and we are thankful to
[49:44] God that the Lord spared his life. They
[49:48] said he had about 15 minutes to live.
[49:51] who was bleeding to death. Many
[49:53] greetings to you and to the saints
[49:55] around you. Uh your thankful sister
[49:59] Martina. So, praise God. We're happy.
[50:03] Marcus Becker was the one that put out a
[50:04] book of all the different places and
[50:08] where phenomena different phenomenal
[50:10] things happened in brother Brandham's
[50:12] life and ministry and a CD with it as
[50:14] well. We we don't have the book here. I
[50:18] have a copy but uh nevertheless they are
[50:22] available from brother Jeff Jenkins
[50:24] church Bible believers there. Thank you
[50:27] musicians. Thank you.
[50:30] If you'd like to open your Bible please
[50:32] to First Kings the 18th chapter. And
[50:35] thank you for standing.
[50:47] And before I read, I'd just like to
[50:49] forewarn you that uh I want to speak
[50:54] [clears throat]
[50:55] on a subject that involves absolutely
[50:58] every person here because you're here
[51:00] and you're living. You have a heart
[51:01] that's pumping. And I want to speak
[51:03] about the heart. But uh my subject this
[51:07] morning is Elijah and the altar. And I'm
[51:12] I'd like to draw a comparison and
[51:14] relationship between your heart, which
[51:18] is not the muscle that's pumping blood
[51:20] just now, but you your heart as the
[51:23] Bible speaks of it. It is such a vast
[51:26] subject. I can scarcely
[51:29] uh touch or give an introduction this
[51:31] morning. But I'm praying that God I've
[51:33] already prayed much that God will give
[51:36] you divine spirit of understanding and
[51:40] revelation that you that that some part
[51:42] of the service even if it's a word or a
[51:44] sentence will just connect with you and
[51:47] that you'll remember it for the rest of
[51:49] your life. That's what I pray.
[51:53] sec first Kings
[51:56] 18
[51:58] and we'll start at verse 21.
[52:09] Verse 21. And Elijah came unto all the
[52:12] people and said, "How long halt ye
[52:16] between two opinions? If the Lord be
[52:19] God, follow him. But if Baal, then
[52:21] follow him." And the people answered him
[52:24] not a word. And an opinion is
[52:28] experiencing
[52:30] contradictory and opposing emotions
[52:34] toward the same person at the same time.
[52:39] That's what opinion is. And especially
[52:44] to love and hate at the same time. You
[52:46] may wonder about that, but it's directed
[52:48] to the same person. So on one hand, they
[52:51] love God. on the other hand, they
[52:53] wouldn't serve him. So he said, "How
[52:55] long will you halt between two
[52:57] opinions?" Then said Elijah unto the
[53:00] people, I even I only remain a prophet
[53:02] to the of the Lord, but Baal's prophets
[53:05] are 450
[53:07] men.
[53:08] Let them therefore give us two bullocks.
[53:11] Now, I'd like you to notice as we go
[53:12] through how Elijah gives the order of
[53:15] things. Let them give us two bullocks,
[53:18] and let them choose one bulock for
[53:20] themselves, and cut it in pieces, and
[53:24] lay it on wood, and put no fire under.
[53:27] And I will dress the other bulock, and
[53:29] lay it on wood, and put no fire under.
[53:32] And call ye upon, call ye on the name of
[53:35] your gods, and I will call on the name
[53:38] of the Lord, and the God that by fire,
[53:42] let him be God. And all the people
[53:44] answered and said, "It is well spoken."
[53:48] And Elijah said unto the prophets of
[53:50] Baal, "Choose you one bulock for
[53:52] yourselves, and dress it first, for ye
[53:54] are many, and call on the name of your
[53:57] gods, but put no fire under." And they
[54:00] took the bullock which he uh was given
[54:03] them. And they dressed it and called on
[54:06] the name of Baal from morning even until
[54:09] noon, saying, "Oh Baal, hear us." But
[54:12] there was no voice, nor any that
[54:16] answered. And they leaped upon the altar
[54:19] which was made. And it came to pass that
[54:22] Elijah mocked them and said, "Cry aloud
[54:26] uh for he is a he is a god. Either he is
[54:29] talking or he is pursuing or he is in a
[54:33] journey or pre-adventure he sleepeth and
[54:36] must be awake." And they cried aloud and
[54:39] cut themselves after the their manner
[54:42] with knives and lancets till the blood
[54:45] gushed out upon them. And it came to
[54:48] pass when midday was passed and they
[54:51] prophesied until the time of the
[54:53] offering of the evening sacrifice.
[54:55] Notice until the evening sacrifice that
[54:58] there was neither voice nor any that to
[55:01] answer nor any that regarded. And Elijah
[55:06] said unto all the people, "Come near
[55:07] unto me." And all the people came near
[55:10] unto him. Great evangelistic meetings.
[55:14] And he repaired the altar of the Lord
[55:17] that was broken down. I want to stop
[55:20] there for a moment. Wasn't it amazing
[55:22] that these 400 prophets didn't have any
[55:25] didn't have any conscience that the
[55:27] altar was broke down? Here they're
[55:29] taking the bulock and they're cutting it
[55:31] up in pieces and they're preparing the
[55:33] wood and they're doing all these things.
[55:35] The altar's broken down.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; The basic fundamental is gone. It's not
[55:40] there. They have no conscious of it.
[55:42] They have no awareness of it and they're
[55:44] carrying on with all of his prayers and
[55:47] prophesying and all of these things. the
[55:49] altar's broken down
[55:53] &gt;&gt; and he repaired the altar of the Lord
[55:56] that was broken down.
[56:00] And Elijah took the 12 stones according
[56:02] to the number of the tribes of the sons
[56:04] of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord
[56:07] came, saying, Israel shall be thy name.
[56:10] And with the stones he built an altar in
[56:13] the name of the Lord. And he made a
[56:15] trench about the altar as great as would
[56:18] contain two measures of seed. And he put
[56:20] the wood in order. And he cut the bulock
[56:23] in pieces and laid him upon the wood and
[56:26] said, "Fill four barrels with water and
[56:29] pour it upon the burnt sacrifice and on
[56:32] the wood." And he said, "Do it the
[56:34] second time." And they did it the second
[56:36] time. And he said, "Do it the third
[56:38] time." And they did it the third time.
[56:40] And the water ran round about the altar
[56:43] and filled the trench also with water.
[56:46] And it came to pass at the time of the
[56:48] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[56:51] Elijah the prophet came near and said,
[56:55] Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of
[56:58] Israel. Let it be known this day that
[57:02] thou art God of Israel, and that I am
[57:05] thy servant, and that I have done all
[57:08] these things at thy word. Hear me, oh
[57:12] Lord. Hear me, that this people may know
[57:15] that thou art the Lord God, and that
[57:18] thou hast turned their heart back again.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats.
[57:42] The heart in the Bible
[57:46] is the inner man.
[57:50] And the scripture says that in Malachi
[57:54] that Elijah would be sent again. There's
[57:57] Elijah number one.
[57:59] Right after him was Elisha, Elijah
[58:01] number two. Then John the Baptist,
[58:04] Elijah number three. And in this day,
[58:07] Elijah number four. And will appear back
[58:09] to Israel, Elijah number five. Five
[58:12] times he comes.
[58:14] And uh he will turn the heart.
[58:19] And the heart is the inner man. And I
[58:22] just like to lay some emphasis. He will
[58:24] turn the inner man.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; He will turn the inner man because the
[58:28] inner man needs to be turned.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; The heart is the mind. He will turn the
[58:34] mind.
[58:38] He will turn the will. The heart is the
[58:40] will. We all have a heart. We all have
[58:43] an inner man. We all have a mind. We all
[58:46] have a will. Oh, I've prayed so many
[58:49] times. God help us to bend our will,
[58:53] turn our will.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; We have uh ideas that we're going to do
[58:58] certain things and God needs to turn
[59:01] that and he has sent a message to turn
[59:04] that and he will turn the heart. He will
[59:08] turn the understanding. The heart is the
[59:10] understanding. We have a certain
[59:12] understanding. Many of us have had all
[59:15] kinds of understandings and this message
[59:18] turned that understanding,
[59:21] &gt;&gt; did it not?
[59:24] &gt;&gt; The soul,
[59:27] the knowledge. Oh, what knowledge we had
[59:31] that needed to be turned.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Turned where? Turned. He would send a
[59:36] specific word to turn that knowledge to
[59:39] the knowledge of God that our
[59:41] understanding would be correct. We have
[59:44] such even within this congregation
[59:46] sitting here today and those that are on
[59:48] the internet, we've had so many thoughts
[59:51] and so many ideas of God and so much
[59:54] preaching. And I hear I've heard
[59:56] ministry even within the message and
[59:58] they have all kinds of types and all
[1:00:00] kinds of shadows. There's one type and
[1:00:03] shadow and that comes from the message
[1:00:04] of the hour.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; And because that has been designed by
[1:00:10] God, sent by God to a generation whose
[1:00:14] hearts needed to be turned, whose minds
[1:00:17] needed to be turned, whose wheels needed
[1:00:20] to be turned, we were so set in our
[1:00:23] ways, we needed to be turned.
[1:00:26] And still even today within our
[1:00:28] congregation, we need things. We need
[1:00:31] that uh supple. We need to be supple and
[1:00:34] ready and flexible so that God can take
[1:00:37] and turn our minds and our thoughts and
[1:00:40] our hearts
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; have an effect upon us. That this will
[1:00:45] not just be a Sunday morning service,
[1:00:47] but it'll be a time when God, the hands
[1:00:50] of God will be felt within your heart.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; The reflection and the memory. Oh, the
[1:01:00] memory, the memory that's in that memory
[1:01:04] channel,
[1:01:06] your heart.
[1:01:09] God needs to turn that from what we
[1:01:12] remember, what we hold in our memory and
[1:01:16] turn that our inclination, our
[1:01:18] resolution. We become resolute. I'm
[1:01:21] going to do a certain thing. I'm going
[1:01:22] to go a certain way. This is my
[1:01:24] direction. This is my direction. And if
[1:01:26] you absorb yourself and give yourself to
[1:01:30] the message of the hour, you'll find a
[1:01:32] power starting to twist and turn. The
[1:01:35] power of transformation turning you from
[1:01:37] your resolution, what you're going to
[1:01:40] be, what you're going to do. And you'll
[1:01:42] find that your interests are changing
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; by the power of God. God sent by Elijah.
[1:01:51] And he turned in his first coming of the
[1:01:53] spirit of Elijah turned the hearts of
[1:01:55] the people and they still doing it. It's
[1:01:58] one of the fundamental things
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; of Elijah's ministry
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; and you might say [clears throat] he
[1:02:12] already did. That's what I experienced.
[1:02:14] I came to believe the message. I can
[1:02:17] tell you that there are most of us in
[1:02:20] the message need to still have the
[1:02:22] effects of that turning power,
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; the determination
[1:02:30] and the conscience and the moral
[1:02:32] character to turn the conscience
[1:02:37] to sharpen our conscience.
[1:02:40] I don't want to sound
[1:02:43] at all harsh. I don't want to sound
[1:02:46] that. But I want to say from a burdened
[1:02:48] heart what I have seen, what I observe
[1:02:52] of recent times, when I say recent
[1:02:55] times, perhaps the last number of years,
[1:02:57] maybe five or more years, but even more
[1:03:00] pronounced
[1:03:02] uh more pronounced even now.
[1:03:04] People still maintain, oh, they believe
[1:03:07] in a prophet. Don't go to church,
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; don't fellowship,
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; don't participate, don't contribute
[1:03:16] anything.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; And uh uh the standards of the world
[1:03:25] creep in
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; and there's even a sense of pride. I'm
[1:03:29] still a believer.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Not by not by my understanding.
[1:03:40] Yeah. They need to give themselves
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; to the word that God sent
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; so that they can be turned from their
[1:03:50] own thoughts, their own will, their own
[1:03:53] direction and their and that God may
[1:03:56] give them a conscience,
[1:03:59] a quickening to their conscience.
[1:04:06] I was at the wedding Thursday
[1:04:10] and I just observed everyone
[1:04:13] and I was I wasn't saying too much but I
[1:04:16] observed a lot
[1:04:18] and this message was heavy on my heart.
[1:04:22] God. The people need a fresh outpouring
[1:04:28] of the spirit of God by the spirit of
[1:04:31] Elijah to renew their conscience. There
[1:04:34] should have been people convicted,
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; about the way they lived, about the way
[1:04:39] they dressed, about the way they spoke.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about those that spoke
[1:04:47] at the wedding. Understand me? But our
[1:04:49] conduct, our moral conduct,
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; I'll continue on.
[1:04:59] The heart is the seat of appetites.
[1:05:03] It's the seat of emotions.
[1:05:08] It's the seat of courage
[1:05:11] and the seat of passions.
[1:05:14] The heart.
[1:05:16] Friends,
[1:05:18] don't ever forget this service.
[1:05:21] Only the spirit of Elijah that was sent
[1:05:24] today can turn those passions.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Turn.
[1:05:31] Turn.
[1:05:33] He did it in his first coming. Said come
[1:05:36] near to me. We need to come near to who
[1:05:40] God has sent. It won't be popular. And
[1:05:45] this is what is said
[1:05:48] in the seven church ages. He said, "Just
[1:05:50] as Israel came or come in its beauty
[1:05:55] back in the beginning under Abraham,
[1:05:57] come on down through the patriarchs. And
[1:06:00] in the day of Ahab, which was the day
[1:06:03] Ahab was ruling, right where we read,
[1:06:05] and in the day of Ahab,
[1:06:08] it went into the dark ages. and the
[1:06:11] darkest age that the church sang.
[1:06:16] And in that time, how that Ahab married
[1:06:19] Jezebel brought idolatry into the
[1:06:22] Orthodox church. The same thing
[1:06:27] the Protestantism
[1:06:29] married Romanism in the 1500s of dark
[1:06:32] ages in the Pergamist church came come
[1:06:35] out with idolatry under the form of
[1:06:38] Christianity going on out into the into
[1:06:41] lukewarm age that's coming on before us
[1:06:44] and we're in it right now. We're in that
[1:06:48] lukewarm age.
[1:06:51] Now, I'm not saying in the sense I I
[1:06:54] recognize that there's believers and we
[1:06:57] are gathered here because this message
[1:06:59] is the most precious thing. But I want
[1:07:01] to say that the age is a lukewarm age.
[1:07:05] And if there's anything uh that Satan
[1:07:08] would do, he's so subtle. He want to
[1:07:10] bring so so that the heat is is lessened
[1:07:14] so that the zeal is lessened
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; and so that our intensity for God's word
[1:07:21] and our hunger and desire is somehow uh
[1:07:25] lessened
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; because it has a cooling power. It has a
[1:07:30] cooling effect upon us. And so what we
[1:07:33] need to do as believers, we need to keep
[1:07:35] our keep our focus on remaining hot,
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; remaining zealous,
[1:07:41] remaining holy
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; because it would try to make us unholy
[1:07:46] or just not not whirly. We're not like
[1:07:49] the people on the street, but you know,
[1:07:52] you can just see the influences of it.
[1:07:55] It it it's it's it's more of the fashion
[1:07:58] of the day.
[1:08:00] It has a cooling effect.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; It has a cooling effect.
[1:08:07] And then he went on. He says, "Now I
[1:08:09] want to be very careful here.
[1:08:12] I want you to be very careful here and
[1:08:14] see this.
[1:08:19] God has promised that at the end time
[1:08:23] Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled."
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Just a moment.
[1:08:31] I have this for you to
[1:08:35] uh see and read along with me.
[1:08:41] God has promised
[1:08:44] that at the end time Malachi 4 is going
[1:08:46] to be fulfilled.
[1:08:49] [clears throat]
[1:08:57] Jesus referred to it.
[1:09:01] It is just before Christ comes the
[1:09:04] second time.
[1:09:07] And by the time Jesus comes, all
[1:09:10] scripture must be fulfilled. Amen.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; The gentile age, the gentile
[1:09:19] dispensation
[1:09:21] will be in its last church age when the
[1:09:24] messenger of Malachi comes.
[1:09:29] He will be right with the word.
[1:09:36] Did we get that?
[1:09:41] Now, here's the next one. And I want you
[1:09:43] to follow very very closely.
[1:09:47] He will take the whole Bible from
[1:09:50] Genesis to Revelation.
[1:09:52] He will start at the serpent seed.
[1:09:56] And thank God for that
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; and carry on to the messenger
[1:10:04] in the latter reign. Amen.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; There is a messenger and that messenger
[1:10:13] is Christ
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; in the latter reign.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; But he will be rejected by the
[1:10:21] denominations.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; It's like Samuel. And the Lord said unto
[1:10:28] Samuel, "Hearken unto the voice of the
[1:10:31] people in all that they say unto thee."
[1:10:36] Isn't that amazing?
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; They've rejected Samuel. They've
[1:10:40] rejected his old whole order of of
[1:10:43] worship. They've actually rejected the
[1:10:46] office of God's prophet.
[1:10:49] But they haven't they haven't rejected
[1:10:53] uh worship as such or religion as such
[1:10:56] or an order as such. They just want a
[1:10:58] different order. And God is saying
[1:11:01] hearken to the voice of the people in
[1:11:04] all that they say unto thee for they
[1:11:07] have not rejected the thee, but they
[1:11:10] have rejected me that I should not reign
[1:11:14] over them.
[1:11:20] I just want to get one thing there. God
[1:11:22] is actually telling his prophet, give
[1:11:24] the people what they want.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Give the people what they want. And so
[1:11:30] people try to, you know, when you're
[1:11:33] when you're in the message and you're
[1:11:35] reading the message, sometimes you hear
[1:11:37] things you you've got to ask yourself,
[1:11:39] who's he speaking to?
[1:11:42] It may be speaking to Pentecost or
[1:11:44] speaking to and then that's why it says
[1:11:46] sometimes I'm not speaking to you
[1:11:48] sisters that are here. These tapes go
[1:11:51] around the world. You understand?
[1:12:00] It is at such a time as this that the
[1:12:03] messenger of Malachi must come. Then in
[1:12:07] the latter rain, then in the latter rain
[1:12:11] will come a Mount Carmel showdown.
[1:12:16] That's what we read today. That is a
[1:12:18] Mount Carmel showdown.
[1:12:23] So it's not back in history in First
[1:12:25] Kings. It happens to be here.
[1:12:29] Amen.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; At our time,
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; we may be standing around looking, but
[1:12:35] we don't perhaps aren't aware of really
[1:12:37] what we're observing.
[1:12:45] Jesus came and had a mount
[1:12:47] transfiguration
[1:12:49] showdown.
[1:12:50] Now, just before Jesus had a mount
[1:12:52] transfiguration showdown, the spirit of
[1:12:55] Elijah came and introduced him.
[1:13:00] So there was a messenger that came
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; but then the messenger Jesus Christ came
[1:13:07] and had the showdown.
[1:13:12] The second forerunner of Christ will sew
[1:13:15] for the latter reign. The second
[1:13:17] forerunner which is none other than
[1:13:20] William Brham will seow sew the seed for
[1:13:25] the show for the latter reign and Jesus
[1:13:29] Jesus will be the showdown between the
[1:13:34] denominations and the creeds. It wasn't
[1:13:35] William Brandham. It was Christ in the
[1:13:37] word
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; who was the he he he he was the he he he
[1:13:43] was the showdown between the
[1:13:44] denominations and the creeds for he will
[1:13:47] come to back up his word and take the
[1:13:50] bride in the rapture.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; So that's a whole that's consummates the
[1:13:54] whole thing and we're part of that.
[1:13:56] We're part of that. That's why we're
[1:13:58] here. He will come for that purpose. And
[1:14:02] that is why he said uh the messenger
[1:14:06] will take it all the way to the
[1:14:08] messenger in the latter reign. John the
[1:14:11] Baptist came but Jesus was the one who
[1:14:13] had the showdown.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; You follow me?
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist came but Jesus was the
[1:14:19] one that had the showdown. Mount
[1:14:20] Transfiguration. Now we have another
[1:14:23] showdown between the denominations and
[1:14:25] the creeds and whatever. You say, "Well,
[1:14:27] why are we speaking that we're not a
[1:14:29] denomination?" That's exactly right. But
[1:14:31] it's the effect of the world and the
[1:14:34] religious and our religious past that
[1:14:37] somehow in our memory. That's why the
[1:14:39] memory needs to be turned. The will
[1:14:41] needs to be turned. The spirit of God in
[1:14:44] the message of the hour needs to turn
[1:14:47] us.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; The spirit of the age tells us we all
[1:14:52] have a right. We're in the age of
[1:14:54] rights. I have a right to believe what I
[1:14:56] I have a right to say what I want to
[1:14:58] say. I have a right to be the person I
[1:14:59] want to be. But maybe the spirit of
[1:15:01] Elijah wants to turn us from our rights.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Can you agree with me?
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; We need that turning power.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "I want you to be
[1:15:14] very careful to see this." And so we
[1:15:17] trust to see and not only see but to be
[1:15:21] mindful in the message the uh Pergamian
[1:15:25] church age.
[1:15:27] He said our forefathers left this land
[1:15:31] uh left left this land to worship and
[1:15:34] live in freedom and they pushed back the
[1:15:36] natives and took over the land. mighty
[1:15:39] men like Washington and Lincoln were
[1:15:41] raised up. But after a while, other men
[1:15:44] of such poor caliber succeeded, these
[1:15:47] worthy men that soon Ahab was set in the
[1:15:51] presidential chair. Now, Brother Brown's
[1:15:53] not back in the book of Kings. He's up
[1:15:55] in his day and he's identifying it so
[1:15:59] that we can we don't just see it as a
[1:16:02] historical figure 40, 50 years ago now.
[1:16:05] He said, but he had a a a Jezebel behind
[1:16:09] him to direct him. It is at such a time
[1:16:12] as this that the messenger of Malachi
[1:16:15] must come. And he did. Uh then the
[1:16:18] latter rain will come. And it has. A
[1:16:21] mount caramel showdown. And it has.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Watch this carefully now to see it in
[1:16:28] the word. [clears throat] John was the
[1:16:29] forerunner of Malachi 3. He planted uh
[1:16:33] planted the former reign and was
[1:16:35] rejected by the organization of his day.
[1:16:37] Jesus came and had a mount
[1:16:39] transfiguration showdown. The second
[1:16:42] forerunner of Christ will sow for the
[1:16:44] latter reign. Jesus will be the showdown
[1:16:47] between the denominations and creeds and
[1:16:50] he will come to back up his word and
[1:16:54] take his bride in the rapture. Now I say
[1:16:57] to you to those that find question and
[1:17:00] and credibility of the prophet's
[1:17:03] message, where are they going to go when
[1:17:06] it's the only word that God has sent to
[1:17:09] turn the heart?
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Then the heart will not be turned.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; It will be just going straight forward
[1:17:19] and and affected by the influences of uh
[1:17:22] of the day of the age. And that leads to
[1:17:26] lukewarmness.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; And that is the most dangerous. And the
[1:17:32] furthermore, if the conscience, if the
[1:17:35] if the if the if the power of
[1:17:38] transformation that God has put in the
[1:17:41] spoken word doesn't turn the conscience,
[1:17:44] then the conscience becomes seared
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; and a person continues on. You young
[1:17:50] people be especially concerned. Then the
[1:17:53] person just carries on. Well, this is
[1:17:55] the way I brought up. So, you know, I I
[1:17:57] I I wear my hair this way or I live this
[1:17:59] way or I, you know, I I I I live a a a
[1:18:02] good uh family life. So do the Mormons.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; They probably live a lot better family
[1:18:09] lives than many people in the message.
[1:18:11] They live great family lives.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; I I wouldn't I wouldn't trust Joseph
[1:18:16] Smith. Excuse me. Brother Brandham gives
[1:18:18] him respect, but I wouldn't trust him
[1:18:20] with my soul.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Not for one minute.
[1:18:24] That's right.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; I certainly have a right to say, God,
[1:18:28] you vindicated. You vindicated the
[1:18:31] apostles and you stood and vindicated
[1:18:33] Jesus Christ that we may know who he is.
[1:18:36] And he demonstrated the invisible God.
[1:18:39] And we see this power. We see this. We
[1:18:42] see this God, the supernatural God doing
[1:18:44] the supernatural all down through the
[1:18:47] age. And surely we can expect to to put
[1:18:50] our anchor
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; for our soul.
[1:18:54] in something that is supernaturally
[1:18:56] vindicated.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; I have another project I might want some
[1:19:01] of you young people to assist in. And
[1:19:05] that is I would like to have
[1:19:08] I would like to have a a a count. I
[1:19:11] don't need a a specific count, but I
[1:19:13] would like to know how many times
[1:19:17] this prophet of God stood in public
[1:19:21] and revealed the secret of the hearts of
[1:19:24] people. Sometimes six times, sometimes
[1:19:27] twice, sometimes 20 times
[1:19:32] specifically specific things. Each one
[1:19:34] of them would be one in a million or one
[1:19:36] in 10 million or 100 million. and tell
[1:19:39] that person exactly precisely
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; what they're there for, what they're
[1:19:45] praying for.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; I was so moved. He talked to a little
[1:19:51] girl
[1:19:52] in a in a message I was reading in this
[1:19:56] for this service. Talked to this little
[1:19:58] girl and he just talked to her so
[1:20:00] sweetly and so on so forth and said
[1:20:02] something I've never heard. I don't
[1:20:04] remember ever reading it before.
[1:20:07] And he said, "Uh,
[1:20:10] well, I see that you have uh
[1:20:13] your eyes water and red and your your
[1:20:16] nose." Oh, he said it's because you have
[1:20:20] you either have a cold or hay fever. No,
[1:20:22] he said it is hay fever.
[1:20:24] You have hay fever.
[1:20:27] And he says, you know, there's three
[1:20:30] layers of skin.
[1:20:32] Some people only have two. Some people
[1:20:35] only have one. talking about in the
[1:20:37] nose. Thought where in the world did he
[1:20:40] get that? And he says, "And some people
[1:20:43] only have one and those little birds get
[1:20:47] in there and that's the trouble."
[1:20:51] And he says, "But there's something
[1:20:53] else.
[1:20:55] There's something else." He says, "Your
[1:20:57] father, he has a hernia."
[1:21:01] And he talks about her father. And then
[1:21:05] the the trouble that her his her mom
[1:21:08] has. Your mother's not well. And he
[1:21:13] gives every detail about her mother. And
[1:21:16] then he says, "Now you go and lay this
[1:21:18] hand." Cuz he has her by the hand. So
[1:21:21] you go and lay this hand on both of them
[1:21:24] and they'll be healed.
[1:21:28] I'd like a count of how many instances.
[1:21:32] And then all these people that want to
[1:21:35] rise up and say, "Well, this, that,
[1:21:36] that, the other thing." So, no, first,
[1:21:39] first answer these,
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; answer these 10, 12,000 of these. Answer
[1:21:45] one or two of these. Duplicate this.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Let me say this again.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Say to this congregation, that's holding
[1:21:56] power.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; That's turning power.
[1:22:00] And I appreciated what I saw on the Lord
[1:22:04] at the wedding day. Saw you young people
[1:22:07] and saw this congregation. And I am so
[1:22:10] delighted and happy that we can preach
[1:22:13] the word and have a people that'll say
[1:22:15] amen to it. I want to do that. I want to
[1:22:18] live by that.
[1:22:22] Amen.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Little signs appear.
[1:22:30] Little signs of slippage
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; appear.
[1:22:35] And slippage is especially a movement
[1:22:37] away from an original
[1:22:40] or secure place.
[1:22:44] Little signs of slippage.
[1:22:49] We don't want to move away from a secure
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; or a safe place.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Things have changed.
[1:23:02] Thought I'd see just what what does
[1:23:03] brother Brandham say. Now, this is a
[1:23:05] different service and so you we only
[1:23:08] have one service today. I'm not going to
[1:23:09] be particularly long, but I want to say
[1:23:11] what I have to say.
[1:23:15] Brother Bam talked about old-fashioned.
[1:23:17] So I thought, what what did he say was
[1:23:20] oldfashioned?
[1:23:21] Says what he liked about oldfashioned.
[1:23:24] He talked about old-fashioned revival.
[1:23:28] Old-fashioned sassifras preaching. Don't
[1:23:31] ask me what sassifras is, but I know
[1:23:33] it's oldfashioned.
[1:23:35] An [clears throat] oldfashioned
[1:23:36] handshake.
[1:23:38] Old-fashioned Holy Ghost gospel. Yes,
[1:23:40] sir.
[1:23:42] Old-fashioned Holy Ghost church,
[1:23:45] old-fashioned conviction,
[1:23:48] old-fashioned mothers,
[1:23:50] old-fashioned Holy Ghost songs. Thank
[1:23:53] you, brother Ryan. Old-fashioned
[1:23:56] testimony, an old-fashioned cleaning up
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; and old-fashioned praying mothers,
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; old-fashioned prayer meeting,
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; old-fashioned experience of the living
[1:24:07] God,
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; and old-fashioned banners of holiness. I
[1:24:11] say there's nothing wrong with all of
[1:24:13] that. I delight in that.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. May God bless this church
[1:24:18] with all of these things.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; In Clamoth Falls, Oregon, he said, "But
[1:24:30] today, our men and women, our women are
[1:24:32] getting away from that. They're getting
[1:24:35] away from the oldfashioned landmarks
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; we used to go by.
[1:24:40] He said, "You ought to get back to that
[1:24:42] old Pentecostal landmark. What you need
[1:24:45] here in this valley, as I looked around
[1:24:48] today, is an oldfashioned
[1:24:51] God sent, sky blue, sinkilling religion.
[1:24:55] the power of the gospel back in the
[1:24:58] churches again, back through the blood
[1:25:00] of the L of the Lord Jesus into the
[1:25:03] fellowship by relationship by being born
[1:25:07] of the Holy Ghost entering into the
[1:25:10] Pentecostal shakina. Amen. Not talking
[1:25:13] about a denomination for sure. I'm not
[1:25:15] beside myself. He said, "I know where I
[1:25:18] am." Oh, but brother, sister, to get
[1:25:22] caught away into the shakina glory where
[1:25:25] just you and God alone are standing,
[1:25:28] fellowshipping. That's the only approach
[1:25:31] that I know of.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; I just feel like praising God.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; I feel like shaking off all formality.
[1:25:43] feel like shaking off all order of the
[1:25:46] service, saying, "Glory be to God."
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Would you like to do that?
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Why don't you do that?
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:09] We praise
[1:26:12] your wonderful name.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Turning by the power of the Holy Ghost,
[1:26:25] both to the right way and from the
[1:26:28] wrong. Both. It's a double-edged sword.
[1:26:31] Both to the right way and away from the
[1:26:33] wrong. Following the altar through the
[1:26:36] scriptures, I found that Noah, that's
[1:26:40] the first time altar is mentioned in the
[1:26:42] Bible. That the altar is mentioned in
[1:26:45] the Bible. Brother Brandham says Cain
[1:26:47] and Abel both built an altar.
[1:26:52] But it's the first time it's mentioned
[1:26:53] in the Bible. And Noah immediately
[1:26:56] following the flood, Noah built an altar
[1:26:59] and offered sacrifices to God.
[1:27:03] alters.
[1:27:04] I'm comparing it to your heart, your
[1:27:06] inner man, your inner being, your inner
[1:27:09] person, your will, your conscience, your
[1:27:11] memory, your resolution, your
[1:27:14] determination,
[1:27:15] or that inner person.
[1:27:20] It could be of wood or earth. Earth,
[1:27:25] simple things that everybody can get a
[1:27:28] hand on.
[1:27:30] Or wood
[1:27:33] or stone,
[1:27:36] unhuman stone,
[1:27:40] brass.
[1:27:43] The I'm talking about the heart now,
[1:27:45] which was brazen in the Bible. and gold.
[1:27:50] Those the items. Now, let me put it in a
[1:27:53] message language.
[1:27:56] Earth or wood,
[1:27:59] the common simplicity
[1:28:03] within everyone's reach.
[1:28:07] Stone,
[1:28:09] the revelation that takes place
[1:28:13] here in the heart.
[1:28:17] brass,
[1:28:19] a place of judgment,
[1:28:23] a place where things are judged
[1:28:27] in the inner man. No one can judge it
[1:28:29] for you. You must judge it yourself. And
[1:28:33] under the deep conviction of the Holy
[1:28:36] Spirit, you waste something out. And
[1:28:38] perhaps this comes back by the Holy
[1:28:40] Ghost in your memory and you say, "That
[1:28:45] isn't right.
[1:28:47] And I need to change that. Then
[1:28:52] bear with me now. Then comes a time of
[1:28:58] I must sacrifice this.
[1:29:02] That's what the altar is all about. The
[1:29:04] altar is for sacrifice.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; That's what the altar is made for.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; The heart is made for sacrifice.
[1:29:13] And the Bible speaks of the heart as
[1:29:15] being exceedingly wicked.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; And out of the abundance of the heart,
[1:29:19] the mouth speaketh.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; And yet on the other hand, it's the very
[1:29:23] place where God puts his seat. It's a
[1:29:26] it's a place of most holy things. So it
[1:29:29] can have either one or the other. But
[1:29:31] then comes the time when a man or woman
[1:29:35] or a young person weighs it out and
[1:29:37] said, "I I've been so resolved.
[1:29:41] I've been so desiring to do a certain
[1:29:44] thing
[1:29:46] and there's something that keeps rising
[1:29:48] in my heart and I
[1:29:51] perhaps it's the Holy Spirit and you
[1:29:54] read in the message and something twins
[1:29:57] something clicks and it's turning you
[1:30:00] slowly because there's resistance there
[1:30:04] and as you read the message and you
[1:30:05] realize who it is that's speaking and
[1:30:08] this has come from eternity.
[1:30:10] This man did not speak of his own will.
[1:30:13] He spoke things that cost him all of his
[1:30:15] friends.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; He spoke things that caused him to be
[1:30:19] rejected.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; He spoke things that people wanted the
[1:30:23] great gift and the power and the all of
[1:30:25] the revelation of the uh of the secret
[1:30:28] of the hearts, but they didn't want this
[1:30:29] word. And he was being cast out and
[1:30:33] doors closed
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; because it was Christ that was being
[1:30:38] closed out.
[1:30:40] and it's trying to get it to the people.
[1:30:43] And here we are and we say, you know, I
[1:30:46] I just I have that set I've had that set
[1:30:49] in my heart for a long time. And
[1:30:52] finally, one day we just break.
[1:30:58] Okay, God.
[1:31:00] I'm done, right?
[1:31:03] I give it all to you.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; And that's when that thing becomes a
[1:31:07] sacrifice.
[1:31:09] And when you sacrifice it, it never
[1:31:12] comes back to itself again. That burnt
[1:31:15] animal remains burnt, goes up in gases,
[1:31:18] and it never becomes an animal again.
[1:31:20] It's given over to God, and you settle
[1:31:23] it with God, and you go on from there,
[1:31:26] and you're done. That's a sacrifice on
[1:31:29] God's altar.
[1:31:37] And it came to pass
[1:31:40] there were burnt sacrifices. There were
[1:31:42] peace offerings.
[1:31:45] There's incense that was a sweet
[1:31:48] smelling savor to God.
[1:31:50] There was common simplicity, revelation,
[1:31:54] and judgment in character
[1:31:57] rises from the altar.
[1:31:59] of the heart.
[1:32:02] And it came to pass at midday that
[1:32:05] midday was passed and they prophesied
[1:32:07] until the time of the evening sacrifice
[1:32:12] and there was no voice and no answer
[1:32:16] and none that regarded.
[1:32:20] I've spoken to individuals that have
[1:32:22] left this message and I said there will
[1:32:24] be a day
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; you'll need to call on God.
[1:32:29] There will come a time, you know, I find
[1:32:32] that also there's a there is a a searing
[1:32:37] there's a the world has a way of searing
[1:32:40] the conscience
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; and people can be immersed in the world
[1:32:44] and completely going to pieces and hell
[1:32:47] is swallowing them up and yet you hear
[1:32:50] from their lips, I'm fine.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; You know what it is? the world and
[1:32:58] powers of hell have deceived the
[1:33:00] individual to feel I'm fine and yet in
[1:33:04] line in in in in the in the view of the
[1:33:08] scriptures in the view of the message of
[1:33:09] the hour they're going completely the
[1:33:11] opposite direction and the world is
[1:33:14] swallowing them up completely and yet in
[1:33:16] the mind the consciences has has not
[1:33:18] been subjected to the message so they
[1:33:20] say I'm I'm I'm okay
[1:33:24] my family's okay and the Kids are going
[1:33:26] to hell.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; They're going the way of hell.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; They say, "I'm okay." We're not okay.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; It's not in the Bible.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking from a burden heart,
[1:33:40] friends.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; I'm not one who's rejoicing over those
[1:33:45] things.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; I'm spending my life and all my energy
[1:33:50] and all my strength to echo this
[1:33:53] message.
[1:33:54] Amen.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've even had emails since
[1:34:00] the wedding saying, "Thank you for the
[1:34:03] godly stand. Let this church
[1:34:08] as brother Tim Dodd preached on
[1:34:11] Wednesday and I was standing here and
[1:34:14] there was something that spoke to me and
[1:34:16] I I urge you if something speaks to you,
[1:34:19] try to follow my pattern. At least I'll
[1:34:21] give you what I do." I I catch a hold of
[1:34:23] that phrase. I hold it in my heart. I
[1:34:26] will not let it go because I believe the
[1:34:28] Holy Spirit has made it real to me.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; And he said one phrase when Esther came
[1:34:34] in before the king while she was uh uh
[1:34:37] while she was hesitant and so on so
[1:34:38] forth. And yet it was her privilege to
[1:34:40] come in, but she thought it was not. She
[1:34:43] thought she could die, but he was
[1:34:45] waiting for her.
[1:34:47] And when she came in and the king and I
[1:34:50] could see it so real and I I'm giving
[1:34:53] you now a personal testimony to you to
[1:34:56] you as individuals.
[1:34:59] And brother Tim said and the king said
[1:35:02] to Esther, "What is your request?"
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; And I stood right back there and I said,
[1:35:08] "Oh God,
[1:35:10] what is my request?
[1:35:13] I've got things I could ask for.
[1:35:16] I got people I'm very burdened for.
[1:35:19] I've got things I could ask for very
[1:35:22] much in my heart. I thought, what would
[1:35:24] I ask for? What is my request? So my
[1:35:27] request,
[1:35:30] my request, oh God,
[1:35:32] is that you will so pour out
[1:35:35] your own spirit within this congregation
[1:35:39] and within this sanctuary
[1:35:42] that these people will taste and come to
[1:35:45] know the reality of things that I have
[1:35:48] experienced and things that are greater
[1:35:51] than I have ever experienced. Let it
[1:35:53] come. Let this congregation, this
[1:35:56] assembly rise as a flame and as a torch
[1:36:00] within this message of the hour. Let
[1:36:03] them shine with the glory of God and so
[1:36:07] that the that the testimony will reach
[1:36:10] far and broad and even around the world.
[1:36:14] That would be my request.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; That's my request. And so I appeal to
[1:36:21] you. Give your heart
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; as an altar to God
[1:36:26] and search your life. Is there anything
[1:36:28] that needs to be sacrificed? And if
[1:36:30] there is, lay it there
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; and sacrifice it before God.
[1:36:44] And Elijah took the 12 stones
[1:36:49] according to the number of the tribes of
[1:36:51] the sons of Jacob under whom the word of
[1:36:54] the Lord came. Who do the war of the
[1:36:57] Lord come to? The word of the Lord comes
[1:37:00] to the prophet.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; And with the stones
[1:37:08] he built an altar in the name of the
[1:37:10] Lord. He just heard all this prophesying
[1:37:12] and all this going on. Listen this is
[1:37:15] the friends this is in the life this is
[1:37:17] in the life of the prophet this in the
[1:37:19] life of brother Brandham here and that's
[1:37:21] why it talks about there were you know
[1:37:24] blood on her hands and all kinds of
[1:37:26] signs and all kinds of phenomena that
[1:37:29] was happening and right at this time and
[1:37:31] thousands of people coming to his
[1:37:33] meetings and all of these things great
[1:37:35] aal and all these men were having such
[1:37:38] great meetings and so on and so forth
[1:37:41] and calling on God and everything. And
[1:37:44] yet he said to me, he said, "It's over.
[1:37:47] These big meetings are over and I'm in
[1:37:50] I'm including my own." Because he knew
[1:37:52] that the spirit of that had lifted.
[1:37:54] There was a change. A a change had come
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; had already arrived and he was even
[1:38:00] speaking it in advance because of
[1:38:02] meeting some of them were still Jimmy
[1:38:04] Swagger and all these people were still
[1:38:06] going on great big he said it's over.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:38:13] for a current message
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; that is more alive today this morning
[1:38:18] than it was even then. People didn't
[1:38:20] even know what it was.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the opening of the seals.
[1:38:24] Thank God for the opening of the word.
[1:38:26] Thank God for the third pull. We didn't
[1:38:28] even know what the third pull was.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; And so we received revelation. Oh, I got
[1:38:40] such a revelation. You still need
[1:38:44] the message of Elijah
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; to place that stone.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Only Elijah knew. Those stones had
[1:38:55] already been laying there.
[1:38:57] There was no one else who knew anything.
[1:38:59] They they were just a pile of stones.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; All of these truths were always laying
[1:39:05] here.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; We didn't know those truths. And then
[1:39:08] when we say, "Oh, now I got a
[1:39:10] revelation." You still need the prophet
[1:39:12] to to set that stone.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Well, what will it be when he's done
[1:39:20] setting it? Well, he'll place this
[1:39:21] revelation and he'll place that one. And
[1:39:24] what God requires and calls for, he'll
[1:39:27] place them all. And when you're done,
[1:39:29] you'll have an altar.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; I pray that with everything that's in
[1:39:39] me. Oh God, hear me. I pray that for you
[1:39:44] that you will give over and let God that
[1:39:48] you will find out. Give yourself to this
[1:39:50] message. You cannot find your own way.
[1:39:54] That's in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:39:56] Christ. You cannot determine your own
[1:39:59] direction. You will not find your own
[1:40:01] way. Furthermore, you say, "Well, I'm
[1:40:04] okay. Be careful of that." The world
[1:40:07] tells you that. The world is telling
[1:40:09] you, "I'm okay."
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I have I have my family. I
[1:40:14] have my car. I have my things." That's
[1:40:15] nothing. That's rust and ashes.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; That's going to pass away.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; I'll say with the songwriter, "What
[1:40:22] then?"
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; What then?
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Then where are you?
[1:40:28] Don't stand before God having
[1:40:30] disregarded the very word he sent to you
[1:40:33] personally.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Not to tickle your emotion. Now, I'm
[1:40:39] going to dig deep, friends.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going to dig deep. Yes, Lord.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; We'd say, "Well, we I begin to see this
[1:40:49] and oh, I see the serpent seat and I see
[1:40:52] these things and I I I I see the I I see
[1:40:56] the opening of the word in the ministry
[1:40:58] of the son of man. And I see that you
[1:41:01] need him
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; to set those
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; in a proper place." And when they
[1:41:07] finally are set and built up into an
[1:41:10] altar,
[1:41:11] say, "What was this altar for?" It's for
[1:41:14] sacrifice.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; It's for sacrifice.
[1:41:22] And the prophet said, "The altar is your
[1:41:24] heart."
[1:41:29] God even ordained that you would have it
[1:41:32] as a place of sacrifice.
[1:41:43] Maybe at the level that we've lived.
[1:41:46] May I suggest to you it's not
[1:41:49] sufficient.
[1:41:53] What what should I be doing, brother
[1:41:56] Biscll?
[1:41:57] I think you should think about these
[1:41:59] things seriously when you leave here.
[1:42:02] Lay your life down on the sacrifice.
[1:42:08] Can I say a few things about the altar?
[1:42:11] The first one was of Noah.
[1:42:15] Do you mind?
[1:42:20] Abraham built an altar.
[1:42:23] There was altars down through and they
[1:42:26] just God just met them and they just
[1:42:28] made an altar right then. whatever was
[1:42:31] there.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it was made from clouds of
[1:42:35] dirt. Sometimes it there's no special
[1:42:38] place. You don't have to have you don't
[1:42:39] have to find a, you know, wait for some
[1:42:42] special uh high-grade moment.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Maybe you didn't expect the service. I
[1:42:48] didn't expect it,
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; but here we are. Amen.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; And if we believe if you believe we are
[1:42:56] as late as we are
[1:42:59] in time and if you believe that we are
[1:43:02] as close to the rapture change, I say
[1:43:06] the power of the message needs to do
[1:43:09] some more turning within the body of
[1:43:12] believers.
[1:43:24] So only Elijah could take hold of the
[1:43:27] great stones of Revelation and begin to
[1:43:30] shape them into the form of an altar for
[1:43:34] sacrifice. If you read earlier, you find
[1:43:36] that they the people even were leaping
[1:43:38] on their altar.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; It didn't even come to their mind. The
[1:43:43] altar's been broken down.
[1:43:47] They didn't have anybody to repair it.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; And now Elijah knows that God who he
[1:43:54] serves is going to answer by fire.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks and talks about Isaac
[1:44:06] and he's actually carrying the wood
[1:44:08] because he's a perfect type of Christ.
[1:44:10] He's carrying the wood.
[1:44:12] He's carrying his sacrifice. He's
[1:44:14] carrying his own altar and he is the
[1:44:17] sacrifice and Jesus carrying his cross.
[1:44:23] And then Isaac
[1:44:25] literally climbs up
[1:44:29] onto his altar
[1:44:34] as Jesus. They took him and laid him
[1:44:36] down
[1:44:38] on his altar of wood.
[1:44:42] And there
[1:44:45] your sin,
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; my sin that we can we can say I'm
[1:44:51] without sin and it's gone. It's gone.
[1:44:54] But there all the judgment of almighty
[1:44:57] God had to come with the fires of the
[1:45:01] fire almighty fire of God's justice. And
[1:45:04] there he was judged at that altar
[1:45:09] on his altar. And there righteousness
[1:45:12] sprung like a fountain to make us not
[1:45:15] only clean, but to take our sin and
[1:45:19] bring it into an annihilated state.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Don't let the world come and and impose
[1:45:26] it back onto you.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; See, as Leo is saying, church age, you
[1:45:35] might say, "Well, we're way beyond that,
[1:45:36] brother. I'm glad that we are or you
[1:45:39] are.
[1:45:41] But in this age, way beyond that.
[1:45:45] Say, well, we've gone way beyond that.
[1:45:49] It's it's not that the people become
[1:45:52] that the religious people became rank
[1:45:54] ranked sinners.
[1:45:56] No, he said you become lukewarm.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; They hadn't lost everything. They become
[1:46:03] lukewarm.
[1:46:05] And because of that, God would spew them
[1:46:08] out of his mouth.
[1:46:18] Here's a couple. I'd like to leave you
[1:46:20] with these quotes before I move on.
[1:46:24] In revelation chapter the fourth fourth
[1:46:26] chapter he said but when Christ comes
[1:46:31] you've created an altar on your heart
[1:46:35] and your sins are taken daily
[1:46:38] and the great St. Paul said, "I die
[1:46:41] daily. Nevertheless, I live.
[1:46:44] Not me, but Christ liveth in me." In
[1:46:47] Jehovah Gyra 64, he said, "We have no
[1:46:50] altar to come to." Speaking of the place
[1:46:52] he was preaching, he said, "Your heart
[1:46:55] is the altar."
[1:47:03] He speaks of stones. Now, I want you to
[1:47:06] think about that. I know that I'm
[1:47:07] speaking to uh mature Christians, mature
[1:47:11] believers, but in the light of what I've
[1:47:13] said, he said, "What good is
[1:47:16] what good is stones?" I'll say, "What
[1:47:18] good is revelations?"
[1:47:20] What good is a revelation?
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; If you haven't got a stonemason to shape
[1:47:25] them,
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; confession is stones. We make our
[1:47:32] confessions.
[1:47:33] He says, "And when Peter made his
[1:47:35] confession, Jesus said, "Thou art Peter
[1:47:37] a little stone. But what good is a stone
[1:47:40] if there isn't a stonemason there to
[1:47:42] shape him into a son of God?"
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; He made that confession, but then the
[1:47:47] Holy Ghost had to come upon within him
[1:47:50] and God that that power that word
[1:47:53] transformation transforming power begin
[1:47:56] to shape him into the kind of apostle
[1:47:59] that God would have him to be.
[1:48:03] The stones were there while 400 prophets
[1:48:06] were prophesying
[1:48:08] or preaching
[1:48:10] and all the people.
[1:48:20] There's churches
[1:48:23] that are upholding themselves as voices
[1:48:26] of this message
[1:48:29] who have gone away from the message.
[1:48:31] Yes, that's right.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you,
[1:48:37] where is the power now to turn the
[1:48:40] hearts of the people?
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; And if that power doesn't exist, then
[1:48:45] the hearts of the people have one way to
[1:48:47] go. Listen to me. Only go can go to the
[1:48:50] world
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; because there is no holding power. Don't
[1:48:55] think within yourself, well, somehow
[1:48:57] we're going to sustain ourselves. You
[1:48:59] will never sustain yourself outside of
[1:49:01] the me. That's why it was sent.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Turn the heart from that.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; And if that is relegated to some lower
[1:49:11] place and and well, we we don't but we
[1:49:14] need this plus psychology or we need
[1:49:17] this plus something else. I've seen all
[1:49:20] of that.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; There was a time when the prophet was
[1:49:26] here. We we need the gospel plus we need
[1:49:29] the Bible schools and we need to give
[1:49:32] the diplomas out and we need all of that
[1:49:34] before they can go out preaching the
[1:49:36] gospel. And it was the plus problem. The
[1:49:39] plus that they had plused to themselves
[1:49:42] which actually was cold water on the on
[1:49:45] the hot and turn it lukewarm.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; You know that's true.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that's true.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; I experienced it. I saw it. I've lived
[1:49:54] through it.
[1:49:55] And that is why I hold so fervently I
[1:49:57] say, "Oh God, if if you don't keep this
[1:50:00] fire burning, there's no way for it to
[1:50:03] burn.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; If you don't hold this congregation,
[1:50:06] there is no power that can hold it.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; There is no intelligence.
[1:50:12] Satan is a slicker.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said he knows more about
[1:50:16] the Bible than we do.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; He knows how to handle and articulate it
[1:50:21] and and and introduce it and give
[1:50:24] meaning." Think about it, friends.
[1:50:26] They're being introduced to people all
[1:50:28] over on the internet and everything. I
[1:50:30] wouldn't give it a minute.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; I don't read it for a second. I'm not
[1:50:35] interested in what the unbelievers say.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in what the
[1:50:40] unbelievers say.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; You ought to support that.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; You ought to have the same conviction.
[1:50:48] I'm not preaching to you. I'm I'm
[1:50:50] counseling you from this pullpit.
[1:50:57] I wouldn't give it a second thought.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; When you know the source of it,
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; I would forget it.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Are they men of God?
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; No. People are going to find all kinds
[1:51:12] of fault and all kinds of things. I've
[1:51:16] had them come here and and and uh I've
[1:51:19] been interviewed here by the ecumenical
[1:51:21] newspaper
[1:51:24] and they said, "Well, we understand uh
[1:51:26] you know, they always come up with the
[1:51:28] same things
[1:51:30] 1977."
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; I said, "Well, did you read did you read
[1:51:35] Brother's message?" "Well, no, but they
[1:51:37] they have all of the things that have
[1:51:38] been said about it."
[1:51:41] I said, 'Well, to be a good journalist,
[1:51:43] you need to find and go to the source.
[1:51:45] What did he say about it? Did Did you
[1:51:48] Did you print and say what he said?
[1:51:51] What? He said, "I do not prophesy."
[1:51:53] Well, they said, "But prophesying and
[1:51:55] predicting is the same thing." If you
[1:51:56] look in the dictionary, I don't look in
[1:51:58] the dictionary. Look at what he said.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm not prophesying. I'm
[1:52:03] predicting."
[1:52:05] And furthermore, as far as you you can
[1:52:07] put me down as a fanatic, but when he
[1:52:09] said 1977 ought to usher usher in,
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; and I said, did you read that word
[1:52:16] usher? I said, the bride is being
[1:52:18] ushered in. Where is she? Is she in the
[1:52:20] parking lot?
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Is she at the foyer? Where's the bride?
[1:52:24] She's being ushered in. Has she just
[1:52:26] come into the foyer? Is is she into the
[1:52:28] port kosher? Where is she? Is she just
[1:52:30] coming out of the automobile? Where is
[1:52:32] she?
[1:52:33] And then they begin to get a picture. I
[1:52:35] said, "Is he just coming down the aisle?
[1:52:37] Where is she?"
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; He used exactly the right word.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; The bride is being ushered in.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:52:49] Let us go home. Lord Jesus,
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; take us home.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to go? Can you say, "Take
[1:52:57] me home."
[1:53:01] You ought to be able to say that.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; You ought to be able to say that.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Take me home. I'm ready to go.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; I'm happy for the unadulterated gospel.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; I'm happy that a prophet would say he
[1:53:19] ought to take and preach this gospel
[1:53:21] barefisted.
[1:53:27] Hallelujah.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; A prepared altar.
[1:53:35] A prepared altar. There isn't a man,
[1:53:38] woman, or child in this building that
[1:53:42] doesn't need a prepared altar.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Young man, young woman,
[1:53:49] you have a heart within you. You have
[1:53:51] lots of ambitions. You've got zeal.
[1:53:54] You've got,
[1:53:56] you know, you've got your beauty. You've
[1:53:58] got plans. You've got a future.
[1:54:06] You need someone
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; to build your altar.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; You've got a heart.
[1:54:13] You absolutely have a heart.
[1:54:17] I'm talking now to you young people.
[1:54:21] You've got
[1:54:24] some strength within. You've got plans.
[1:54:29] You've got uh something you've thought
[1:54:31] about and you're going a certain
[1:54:33] direction. I'm not saying it's wrong.
[1:54:37] You boys have a heart.
[1:54:40] There's only one person I know. That's
[1:54:43] the messenger in the rain. None other
[1:54:47] than Jesus Christ. who the prophet was
[1:54:50] sent. And he sent it with the word.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; And that word, if you hear it,
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; if you stay under the sound of it,
[1:54:58] you'll find your life, you'll find it
[1:55:00] almost imperceptibly, you'll find it
[1:55:02] changing
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; and indexing and things you once desired
[1:55:07] will start to dissipate. And then strong
[1:55:10] ambitions will be turned.
[1:55:20] Is that all right?
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; I'm still going to close.
[1:55:34] Here's
[1:55:41] some things
[1:55:44] I just know spoke to you very
[1:55:46] personally. You have a heart.
[1:56:00] That heart
[1:56:02] you have ambitions.
[1:56:05] And I talked about the things that need
[1:56:06] to be turned
[1:56:09] and they will only turn them Godward
[1:56:12] only turn it the right direction.
[1:56:16] But also the heart
[1:56:19] is especially and here's the things the
[1:56:21] Bible says about the heart can be filled
[1:56:24] with fear.
[1:56:29] There isn't anybody here. But what down
[1:56:33] in your heart has experienced fear.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; We fear things. We fear the future. We
[1:56:41] fear will we be able to people will get
[1:56:44] older. They fear whether will there be a
[1:56:46] medical will the medical system be there
[1:56:49] for them. Will will there have enough
[1:56:51] for retirement? Uh they they that are
[1:56:55] raising children, how will my kids turn
[1:56:57] out? And they and they have a concern as
[1:56:59] it's it's all right to be concerned as
[1:57:01] long as we don't turn it to fear and to
[1:57:04] start to fear our future. And brother
[1:57:06] Brandham says when the angel came on
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; always came he would say first fear not.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; And I know what that is friends. I sat
[1:57:22] beside brother Brandham when that angel
[1:57:24] of the Lord came right in the vehicle.
[1:57:28] That presence of that one came right in
[1:57:31] the vehicle. Just a little bit forward.
[1:57:33] Not right between us. Just forward like
[1:57:35] this. Nothing visible to the eyes. Far
[1:57:38] more than visible. I was completely
[1:57:42] frozen.
[1:57:45] And I thought if I breathe I will die.
[1:57:50] If I exhale, I'm going to pass into some
[1:57:53] other place.
[1:57:56] And I just cast my eyes sideways.
[1:57:59] And brother Brandham had lost all the
[1:58:01] color in his face.
[1:58:03] And we had several days beard on. And I
[1:58:06] have seen one man that was right at the
[1:58:09] edge of death that had just just had
[1:58:12] missed death by a hair. and he didn't
[1:58:16] have much of a beard, but his beard just
[1:58:18] stuck out prickly from the shock of the
[1:58:21] body.
[1:58:23] And I just cast my eyes sideways
[1:58:26] and brother Brandon was driving and his
[1:58:30] beard just was prickly all over his face
[1:58:34] and his face was ashen
[1:58:37] and the shot and the thought just shot
[1:58:39] through my mind. He looks like a man
[1:58:41] that's near death.
[1:58:43] And he just
[1:58:45] rolled his head back like this and cast
[1:58:50] his eyes to me. He said, "Brother Eddie,
[1:58:56] I guess he's come to me 10,000 times."
[1:58:59] 10,000.
[1:59:01] And it's every time the same.
[1:59:04] It's just like I could die.
[1:59:07] That was exactly what I was going
[1:59:08] through. I thought I was going to die
[1:59:11] and that was the experience. No wonder
[1:59:14] from that incredible presence
[1:59:18] of the angel of the Lord which is none
[1:59:20] other than the Lord Jesus Christ in that
[1:59:22] form
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; the holiness is so
[1:59:26] intense
[1:59:28] you just can't. And he said to me at
[1:59:30] another time he said it's like a like a
[1:59:33] fine wire with 10,000 volts going
[1:59:36] through it. said we're not these bodies
[1:59:39] aren't made for that.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; That's why you have to have a change in
[1:59:43] your body to live in his presence.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, and we have sent he sent his word to
[1:59:50] change your body.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; We will need to be changed and that is
[1:59:55] why he always would say first fear not
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; it is me
[2:00:03] be not afraid.
[2:00:05] This word will sever from you.
[2:00:10] And this may not apply to everyone, but
[2:00:13] grief.
[2:00:16] Somebody may be in grief
[2:00:18] or despair.
[2:00:23] This word will also not only turn you in
[2:00:25] one direction, but turn you away from
[2:00:28] the despair and the discouragement.
[2:00:33] I know
[2:00:35] the world we live in
[2:00:38] and we're faced with such insurmountable
[2:00:41] things and we say, "Where's the answer?"
[2:00:44] Christ, the word is still the answer.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Still the answer. I'm not preaching to
[2:00:51] make you happy. I'm preaching so you
[2:00:53] might realize the things that have been
[2:00:55] made real to you is nothing other than
[2:00:58] Elijah. the spirit of Elijah
[2:01:01] building up and placing the stones.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; He'll take the heaviness
[2:01:10] and the remorse,
[2:01:13] the brokenness. These are all things
[2:01:15] from the scripture.
[2:01:17] A broken spirit, a broken heart,
[2:01:21] a weary
[2:01:23] heart. We get weary with the toils of
[2:01:27] life.
[2:01:35] But your altar is a place of sacrifice
[2:01:39] where what was in the heart
[2:01:43] dies.
[2:02:03] Apostle Paul said to a group of people,
[2:02:07] notice what he said.
[2:02:10] He said, "I observed your place of
[2:02:12] worship
[2:02:15] and I beheld your devotions
[2:02:18] and I found an altar with this
[2:02:20] inscription
[2:02:22] to the unknown God." You know what?
[2:02:24] There may be somebody here today, even
[2:02:26] though you're a believer of the message,
[2:02:28] you may say, you know, I really don't
[2:02:30] know God.
[2:02:32] You need to know him by knowing him. I
[2:02:37] know in him. I know him in whom I have
[2:02:39] believed.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; We need to know who God is.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; And listen, God is
[2:02:48] this word that's been revealed. That is
[2:02:50] the only God that I really know. Amen.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I've observed this and in
[2:02:59] this inscription to the unknown God,
[2:03:02] whom therefore ye ignorantly worship,
[2:03:06] him I declare unto you.
[2:03:09] Him I declare, not not the church or the
[2:03:12] or just the worship, but him, the person
[2:03:15] I declare unto you." And then when Jesus
[2:03:19] came embodied in flesh and the scripture
[2:03:24] says, "This is my beloved son.
[2:03:28] Hear ye him." And I'm going to close in
[2:03:31] just a few moments, but I want you to
[2:03:33] see this.
[2:03:36] He was the lamb slain.
[2:03:39] Perhaps you can finish it. He was the
[2:03:42] lamb slain.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Perhaps we could say it again. And he
[2:03:46] was the lamb slain
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; And no wonder the prophet could say
[2:03:57] Jesus Christ was God's heart.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; The very heart of God.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Catch it. The very heart of God was on
[2:04:11] an altar
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; in heaven.
[2:04:16] Jesus Christ, the very heart of God. And
[2:04:19] he allowed him to be judged with all the
[2:04:21] severity of the holiness of Almighty
[2:04:24] God. And there he was on an altar in
[2:04:27] eternity, the lamb slain before the
[2:04:30] foundation of the world. And the prophet
[2:04:32] said he came out of the eternities
[2:04:34] wounded cuz he'd been he he had been in
[2:04:37] battle, but he came out victorious
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; for you.
[2:04:45] for you young sisters, for youth
[2:04:47] families, for you senior people, for
[2:04:51] congregation of Cloverdale Bible Way,
[2:04:53] for the believers of this message,
[2:04:55] wherever this gospel will go and
[2:04:57] wherever this message will be preached,
[2:04:59] this heart of God,
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; God laid his own heart
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; on his own altar
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; and sent him down
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; with a message.
[2:05:15] to you.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to do it, but he did it.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; And he let even the messenger, he let
[2:05:25] the vessel be detested and cast out and
[2:05:30] spoken evil of and every kind of thing
[2:05:34] that was not so, but he allowed it. So
[2:05:38] that message,
[2:05:41] tell you what friends,
[2:05:45] nobody knows what that messenger went
[2:05:49] through. We think our trials are big
[2:05:58] and brother Brandham often refers to it
[2:06:03] Samadair,
[2:06:05] Dr. I'm a dare. Tell him, "Billy, you
[2:06:08] better come down quick.
[2:06:11] Your little baby's dying." "Oh, no. No."
[2:06:13] He said, "That can't be."
[2:06:15] And go to her bedside.
[2:06:18] He's all twisted up with spinal menitis.
[2:06:22] And he's crying out to God. And he said
[2:06:24] his prayers just the heavens are like
[2:06:26] brass.
[2:06:30] Brass.
[2:06:32] And God wasn't going to hear it.
[2:06:38] And he said, "The pain is so
[2:06:39] excruciating.
[2:06:41] Some of you are young fathers.
[2:06:45] How would you manage to say you're a
[2:06:47] child?
[2:06:50] This is a real friends.
[2:06:52] How how would we deal with it?" and
[2:06:55] finally see the eyes cross and just in
[2:06:58] such excruciating pain and the eyes
[2:07:01] cross and the child and you're calling
[2:07:04] out don't do it God don't do it don't do
[2:07:06] it
[2:07:08] and just slips away from you
[2:07:11] and brother Brandon said he prayed for
[2:07:14] 400
[2:07:16] children with crossed eyes there wasn't
[2:07:20] one of those parents who walked away
[2:07:23] with their child healed
[2:07:25] from crossed eyes. He said, "Not one of
[2:07:27] them." But what God healed it, there
[2:07:29] wasn't a parent, there's not one parent
[2:07:31] that knew the cost.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; What did that cost for him to be molded
[2:07:38] and pray with such such intensity?
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; And that's what was in his mind is
[2:07:47] little Sharon Rose and all twisted up
[2:07:50] with that spinal menitis.
[2:07:52] What am I talking about? I'm talking
[2:07:54] about a sacrifice
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; and to come to a place where he would
[2:07:59] allow that and let that go
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; and never hold that against God. Thy
[2:08:04] will be done.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; And Jesus
[2:08:10] on his way to his altar.
[2:08:14] The sacrifice has to be prepared.
[2:08:18] And in Gethsemane,
[2:08:20] the sacrifice was being prepared for the
[2:08:23] prepared altar.
[2:08:29] Father,
[2:08:31] if it's possible,
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; if it's possible, let this cup pass.
[2:08:38] Nevertheless, not my will,
[2:08:41] thine be done.
[2:08:44] and the sacrifice the prepared sacrifice
[2:08:50] I don't want to talk about personal
[2:08:52] things because it's so infot it's
[2:08:54] insignificant
[2:08:56] and it doesn't matter but each of us
[2:08:58] have our own
[2:09:01] and it seemed like mama's my whole world
[2:09:05] it's going to disappear
[2:09:08] I never forget I never forget that
[2:09:16] I thought I'd finally that the will of
[2:09:18] God for my life had finally been
[2:09:20] achieved and I didn't have any
[2:09:23] profession. I didn't have any special
[2:09:25] skills but I managed to become executive
[2:09:28] in the company and and I could travel
[2:09:30] and the president just thought
[2:09:32] everything was fine and I was he was so
[2:09:35] happy he said I don't care as long as
[2:09:38] you look after the business you do. I
[2:09:40] went and preached. I took churches while
[2:09:42] pastors were away. I went to Jamaica and
[2:09:44] had a convention. And I I thought this
[2:09:47] was the this was the answer to all of my
[2:09:49] prayers. One day God just said, "Leave
[2:09:53] it.
[2:09:55] You're going to leave this.
[2:10:01] Do you mind if I tell you?
[2:10:07] I thought this is impossible.
[2:10:09] It's impossible.
[2:10:12] But God was starting to prepare made a
[2:10:15] sacrifice
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; thing that I thought was
[2:10:20] the answer to God that God had given me
[2:10:22] all of this and given me this nice job
[2:10:25] and so on
[2:10:27] and gave me favor with the pre president
[2:10:30] of the company and he wouldn't let me
[2:10:31] pay for anything. Wouldn't let me pay
[2:10:32] for the newspaper to my door. wouldn't
[2:10:34] let me pay for the telephone, wouldn't
[2:10:36] let me pay for my car, and they bought a
[2:10:39] house. Bought a house for me, gave me
[2:10:40] the house for $125 a month, beautiful
[2:10:44] fourbedroom, four-level brick home on
[2:10:47] the edge of a creek. And I just thought,
[2:10:49] you know, isn't this wonderful? God has
[2:10:51] finally smiled on me. I'm through hard
[2:10:53] 30 years of hardship.
[2:10:58] Said, leave it.
[2:11:00] Took me nine months.
[2:11:04] Took me nine months.
[2:11:08] And part of that was I drove down just
[2:11:11] to attend a meeting with brother
[2:11:14] Brandham. And Doc Brandham came out in
[2:11:15] the crowd and said, "Brother Brandham is
[2:11:17] here and he'd like to see." And I
[2:11:18] stepped into his office. And he took a
[2:11:21] hold of my hands
[2:11:23] and he said, "Brother Eddie, every time
[2:11:25] I see you, I see Indians."
[2:11:27] And I wanted to come back west so bad.
[2:11:30] And yet I was having and I finally laid
[2:11:32] it down on the altar.
[2:11:35] Sometime we have to find that place. It
[2:11:38] may not be here. I'm not going to have
[2:11:39] an alter call, but you may I'm going to
[2:11:42] pray with this congregation just now.
[2:11:45] I pray that God will prepare you prepare
[2:11:49] your sacrifice.
[2:11:52] Can I say it?
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; God has a greater work for this
[2:11:56] congregation to do.
[2:11:59] This message needs to go out with more
[2:12:02] force
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; and more power
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; and more dedication.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; It needs to be lived on the streets. It
[2:12:10] needs to be witnessed. It needs to be
[2:12:12] lived exactly as the prophet said it.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; And God bless you.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; God bless you, this congregation. God
[2:12:22] bless all under the sound of my voice. I
[2:12:25] have felt directed by Almighty God. And
[2:12:28] I say God bless you
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; and make each of you a flame and a
[2:12:32] torch.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; And if you have not surrendered your
[2:12:36] life to Jesus Christ,
[2:12:39] you should do so.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; You must do so.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; We cannot leave you here.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; This world is falling apart.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:56] Terrible times coming, friends.
[2:12:59] Terrible times. And it'll come in so
[2:13:01] subtle, you'll think this is just
[2:13:02] ordinary stuff. It's not.
[2:13:06] It's wicked. You know why that school is
[2:13:08] there? Because the schools are hell
[2:13:10] holes.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; Know that there's teachers.
[2:13:17] I don't say this of all teachers, but
[2:13:19] many of them are literally
[2:13:20] demonpossessed
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; and come with the intent of deceiving
[2:13:24] his children
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; and the system is corrupt.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether they say they've
[2:13:31] just legalized they've just legalized
[2:13:33] and there's a big ad in our little local
[2:13:35] paper right here.
[2:13:38] to the legalized marijuana.
[2:13:42] And they put a warning out if anybody or
[2:13:44] any organization wants to wants to have
[2:13:46] a voice against it, let it be known as
[2:13:49] going to cost them something. It's going
[2:13:51] to cost them money and you must be
[2:13:53] prepared to pay for it. Isn't that
[2:13:55] incredible? Why don't they say to the
[2:13:57] people, "If you want this, it's going to
[2:13:59] cost you something to get this passed."
[2:14:01] No, they tell those that are opposing
[2:14:03] it, it's going to cost you something.
[2:14:06] I can show you the ad. It's so foolish.
[2:14:09] Somebody wrote it in hell.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Some demon out of hell inspired it.
[2:14:15] Listen, folks. We live in Satan's Eden.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; That just happens to be the truth.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your time.
[2:14:40] Would you stand with me?
[2:14:51] I'd like you if you would bow. And
[2:14:55] perhaps something was said now that
[2:14:59] remains fast in your heart. Hold it.
[2:15:03] Hold it.
[2:15:05] And now I'd like each person to pray and
[2:15:07] ask the Holy Spirit, spirit of God,
[2:15:10] author of this word,
[2:15:13] Almighty God, author
[2:15:16] of the message that has been sent.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; This is not This is a sanctuary, but
[2:15:22] it's not just another church.
[2:15:25] No, this is a place that upholds
[2:15:28] something that very few treasure, but we
[2:15:31] treasure it. Lord, we treasure it with
[2:15:33] all of our heart. I thank you for the
[2:15:36] stalward hearts of the people. I thank
[2:15:40] you for this loyal support, oh God, and
[2:15:44] they come with their presence. They come
[2:15:47] with their conviction.
[2:15:50] The people come with their courage.
[2:15:52] You have indeed turned our hearts
[2:15:56] uh from the uh ways of the world. Not
[2:15:59] merely the ways of the world, but the
[2:16:02] lukewarmness and the inconsistency
[2:16:06] and the just the wavering
[2:16:09] uh as waves driven of the sea. But you
[2:16:13] have given us a stability, Lord. We're
[2:16:17] so thankful for that. We're so thankful
[2:16:19] for the standard that you have put
[2:16:22] within the hearts of the people. And
[2:16:25] yet, Lord, we feel that you would move
[2:16:27] us forward. There has been things that
[2:16:30] have hung on, things that have impeded,
[2:16:34] things that have hindered, things, oh
[2:16:36] God, which have uh taken our thoughts
[2:16:39] and have distracted us in different
[2:16:42] ways. In the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:16:45] Satan, I come to oppose you. You are the
[2:16:48] archeneemy of my Lord God, the God of
[2:16:51] Israel. You're the archeneemy of my Lord
[2:16:54] Jesus Christ. And he, Michael, cast you
[2:16:58] out of the heavenly region. You have
[2:17:02] come here to earth. You found your way
[2:17:04] into Eden. And now through the science
[2:17:07] and the people eating from the tree of
[2:17:09] knowledge, oh God, uh, keep us from
[2:17:14] eating from that tree. Oh God, cause us
[2:17:18] to feed at the at the table of the Lord.
[2:17:23] Cause us to feed at that supper table
[2:17:26] that you've prepared. This glorious
[2:17:28] seven course meal that you have given.
[2:17:32] May we eat and may we digest. May we be

[2:17:37] and leadership. I pray in the holy name
[2:17:40] of Jesus Christ.
[2:17:43] in the holy name of Jesus Christ.
[2:17:47] While we're pondering these things, I
[2:17:49] would like to sing, "Open my eyes that I
[2:17:52] may see.
[2:18:03] I'd like you to prayerfully [music]
[2:18:06] sing this. That's been on my mind all
[2:18:08] morning.

[2:18:47] Silently
[2:18:49] now [music]
[2:18:50] I wait for thee.
[2:18:55] I'm ready [music] by God. Thy [singing]
[2:18:59] will to see.

[2:19:51] [music]
[2:19:52] Open my ears that [singing] I may
[2:19:58] [music] hear.
[2:20:00] Voices [singing]

[2:20:09] And while the wind [singing]
[2:20:12] knows what I
[2:20:17] [music and singing] break
[2:20:20] will
[2:20:22] I credit it Lord silently [singing]
[2:20:26] [music] now
[2:20:28] I wait for thee
[2:20:34] my father I
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; See,

[2:20:42] my eyes [music] to
[2:20:47] be
[2:20:49] spend.
[2:20:53] [singing]
[2:20:57] Open [music]
[2:20:58] my mouth
[2:21:00] and let me pray. [music and singing]
[2:21:04] Glad to be the Lord
[2:21:08] through everywhere. [singing]
[2:21:12] [music]
[2:21:13] Open my heart
[2:21:16] and let me prepare. [singing]
[2:21:20] Love with my [music] children.
[2:21:24] [singing]
[2:21:29] Silently
[2:21:30] bound
[2:21:32] I [music and singing] wait for thee.
[2:21:37] Ready [singing] my God. [music] I will
[2:21:42] to see.
[2:21:45] Open [singing] my [music] eyes
[2:21:48] to
[2:21:50] me.
[2:21:52] See, [music]
[2:21:57] [singing]
[2:21:59] [music]
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; I'm not just going to say a closing
[2:22:02] prayer. I feel I would
[2:22:04] disobey and grieve the Holy Spirit if I
[2:22:06] did that.
[2:22:10] There no doubt is some here that's right
[2:22:13] on the cusp of a decision. [music]
[2:22:19] You may have already settled it in your
[2:22:21] heart.
[2:22:23] Please understand
[2:22:26] our culture,
[2:22:28] the culture of this nation, the culture
[2:22:30] of America, the culture of the world
[2:22:33] [music] has not been designed and
[2:22:35] cultivated by God,
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; by a Holy Spirit.
[2:22:41] [music] The world has their standards
[2:22:43] and the world has their and they've
[2:22:45] imposed that upon us. And perhaps
[2:22:48] perhaps you may be here. Perhaps
[2:22:51] you may be here under the effects or in
[2:22:55] influenced by the age that we're in. I
[2:22:59] pray that God will wash that away.
[2:23:04] Perhaps you say, "Well, I was raised in
[2:23:06] a certain culture and certain things
[2:23:08] were accepted. Are they accepted by the
[2:23:12] message?"
[2:23:17] You want to ask that. you want to ask
[2:23:19] yourself, whatever you do, don't put
[2:23:22] that in second place. Put it in number
[2:23:25] one.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; And I appeal especially to you young
[2:23:28] men, young ladies, the young people of
[2:23:31] this congregation.
[2:23:33] You will have to take this gospel.
[2:23:35] [music]
[2:23:37] You'll have to take this standard and
[2:23:39] you'll have to hold it high and you'll
[2:23:42] have to declare it in life and declare
[2:23:44] it in word.
[2:23:46] It will be on your shoulders to raise
[2:23:48] families
[2:23:49] [music] and to have homes that are God
[2:23:52] glorifying. It's not enough for us to
[2:23:55] stand here and preach and and for you to
[2:23:57] look on at that. You got to say that'll
[2:24:00] be me.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; That's my place. I must do that.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; And so if you have that
[2:24:11] something that perhaps you feel I I need
[2:24:14] I need a nudge.
[2:24:16] I just feel to be strengthened.
[2:24:19] And if you feel urged to come and stand
[2:24:22] or to come and kneel as our sister
[2:24:24] [music] has. It's open. This is not the
[2:24:27] altar. The altar is in your heart.
[2:24:31] That's the altar God's looking at. This
[2:24:33] place won't do anything for you unless
[2:24:36] it's right in here. And so God, if God's
[2:24:39] been dealing with you and speaking to
[2:24:40] you and calling you, he has a plan. I
[2:24:44] don't know what that plan is, but he has
[2:24:45] a plan.
[2:24:47] So we'll just sing it once again.
[2:24:50] Silently [music] now
[2:24:57] [music]
[2:24:58] [singing]
[2:25:00] for thee.
[2:25:03] I'm ready. [music]
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; I'm ready, oh God.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; I will.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; I [music] will to see.
[2:25:12] Open
[2:25:13] my [singing] eyes.
[2:25:18] [music and singing]
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; is [singing]
[2:25:30] worth [music]
[2:25:33] I [singing] wait for thee.
[2:25:40] My God,
[2:25:42] [music] thy will
[2:25:45] to see.
[2:25:47] Lord, [music and singing] open my eyes
[2:25:51] to you
[2:25:53] and me. [music]
[2:26:00] [music]
[2:26:02] Say, "Savior, Savior, pass me down.
[2:26:05] [music] Savior, Savior, hear my humble
[2:26:08] cry. You that have come and you that are
[2:26:11] standing,
[2:26:14] just release [music] and let that cry of
[2:26:16] your heart go up to quad.
[2:26:19] [music] You're here for a divine
[2:26:21] purpose. I'm taking this service so
[2:26:24] seriously.
[2:26:26] May this be a lifechanging moment.
[2:26:28] [music]
[2:26:31] May this be a life-changing moment. I
[2:26:33] speak it in the name of the Lord.
[2:26:36] And it's for the purpose that you have
[2:26:38] come that you shall receive your answer
[2:26:41] from the hand and heart of almighty God.
[2:26:45] [music]
[2:26:46] They will see your heart. The altar of
[2:26:49] God.
[2:26:52] Father, these altars
[2:26:54] stand here at this human altar. But this
[2:26:57] is not the altar.
[2:27:00] God, you're the one that looks upon the
[2:27:03] heart. You said, "I look upon the heart,
[2:27:06] not the outward mind.
[2:27:08] I look upon the heart." Lord, I pray
[2:27:10] that you'll find the answer
[2:27:15] in the sacrifice,
[2:27:17] saying, "Not my will. Thy be done.
[2:27:22] [music]
[2:27:23] Not my will.
[2:27:32] gentle
[2:27:36] [music]

[2:27:43] my heart.

[2:29:02] deacons would come. Brother Kyle, if
[2:29:05] you're free, come. [music]
[2:29:08] others men of God that
[2:29:13] pray
[2:29:17] you're willing to come and pray. Brother
[2:29:19] Andy's if you would come. [music]

[2:46:04] Oh, the [singing] sails are cold.
[2:46:09] [music]

[2:46:26] hold
[2:46:31] [singing] of the stor. [music]
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father,
[2:46:42] You have seen [music]
[2:46:45] this service.
[2:46:47] You've watched the people come.
[2:46:51] You know what was in their heart or in
[2:46:53] their expectation.
[2:46:56] [music] You saw me coming with the
[2:46:59] perhaps trembling. Oh God, not knowing
[2:47:02] just exactly how to say it or how to
[2:47:05] deliver it.
[2:47:07] [music] Lord, you've taken
[2:47:10] the words of your messenger. You've
[2:47:12] taken the words of your scripture
[2:47:14] [music]
[2:47:15] and we see once again we have come under
[2:47:17] the influence of Elijah. We've we're
[2:47:20] standing and seeing the great showdown.
[2:47:25] And now, oh father, we'll see another
[2:47:29] showdown.
[2:47:31] &gt;&gt; We'll see another showdown. Oh God,
[2:47:35] [music] for the dead in Christ shall
[2:47:36] rise incorruptible.
[2:47:39] there would be changed and we shall be
[2:47:42] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[2:47:45] eye. And that's why we're here. We're
[2:47:48] getting prepared, Lord.
[2:47:50] &gt;&gt; The altar and the lives are being
[2:47:52] prepared. Not for this world, not for a
[2:47:54] future down here, but for a future up
[2:47:57] there.
[2:47:58] Oh God, this is an eternal thing that
[2:48:00] you're doing.
[2:48:02] And I thank you for it. I pray that you
[2:48:04] will continue, Lord. Continue.
[2:48:07] Perhaps something that was started here
[2:48:08] in the service and a thought and a
[2:48:11] movement of the Holy Spirit. [music]
[2:48:13] Continue on with it, Lord. And don't let
[2:48:15] it don't let it be diluted and don't let
[2:48:18] it diminish, but let it may it
[2:48:21] intensify. May it increase. [music]
[2:48:24] Let the Holy Spirit, oh God, you'll
[2:48:26] answer my prayer.
[2:48:27] as I pray that you will cause this place
[2:48:30] to become a flaming burning torch and
[2:48:34] light [music] of the Holy Spirit of God
[2:48:38] both here in the Pacific Northwest and
[2:48:41] around the world. Oh God, and wherever
[2:48:44] it is being live stream just now, ignite
[2:48:49] the hearts I pray. whatever room they
[2:48:52] are in or wherever they might be, ignite
[2:48:55] them, oh God, with the very power and
[2:48:57] flame of the Holy Spirit. [music]
[2:49:00] I pray Lord this afternoon that these
[2:49:02] thoughts will not drift away from us and
[2:49:05] we will not get caught up in small talk,
[2:49:08] [music] but our thoughts and our words
[2:49:09] and our minds will be settled on eternal
[2:49:13] things. Bless your people. We pray
[2:49:15] [music] especially oh God for our

[2:50:08] victoriously and gloriously. [music]
[2:50:11] Help us Lord from day to day to trample

[2:50:23] certain rights as children, the elect of
[2:50:26] the living. God, we pray you'll bless
[2:50:29] [music] this people, Lord, as they will
[2:50:33] depart the sanctuary.
[2:50:36] Bless them. Bless those especially,
[2:50:39] Father, that have made this a time when

[2:51:21] want to rejoice.
[2:51:24] &gt;&gt; God, you gave me ears to hear.
[2:51:28] &gt;&gt; Didn't mean anything to so many, but you
[2:51:30] gave me ears to hear.
