[15:00] on to the house of the lord
[15:01] amen god bless you sister
[15:08] brother john's been asking me for a
[15:09] couple of days if i had a special
[15:12] and i had nothing because i really
[15:14] believe in my heart that
[15:16] when a person gets up to sing they
[15:19] should really
[15:20] feel it in their heart it should be
[15:22] something that speaks to them and
[15:23] something that
[15:24] is a cry of their heart and so i just
[15:27] can't get up and sing any song because
[15:29] it has to speak to me and today i was
[15:31] cleaning my house and i was listening to
[15:32] a southern gospel radio station and this
[15:34] song came on and i was like that's the
[15:35] song
[15:37] so brother ben is very gracious and
[15:40] learned it very quickly with me before
[15:42] service so you just pray for me it's a
[15:43] brand new song but
[15:44] it really spoke to my heart and i pray
[15:46] it'll speak to yours
[15:58] [Music]

[16:15] your house and i

[27:12] for you amen let's read in the word
[27:14] tonight
[27:15] matthew 25 then the kingdom
[27:18] then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[27:20] likened unto the ten virgins
[27:22] which took their lamps and went forth to
[27:24] meet the bridegroom
[27:25] and five of them were wise and five were
[27:27] foolish
[27:28] and they that were they that were
[27:30] foolish took their lamps
[27:31] and took no oil with them but the wise
[27:34] took oil in their vessels
[27:35] with their lamps and while the
[27:37] bridegroom tarried
[27:39] they all slumbered and slept and at
[27:41] midnight there was a cry made behold
[27:44] the bridegroom cometh go out to meet him
[27:48] and then all those virgins arose and
[27:51] trim their lamps
[27:52] and the foolish shed under the wise give
[27:54] us of your oil
[27:55] our lamps are gone out the wise answered
[27:58] saying not so lest there be not enough
[28:01] for us
[28:02] and you but go rather to them that sell
[28:06] buy for yourselves and while they went
[28:09] out to buy
[28:11] the bridegroom came and they that were
[28:13] ready
[28:14] went in with him to the marriage and the
[28:17] door
[28:18] was shut afterward came also the other
[28:21] version saying
[28:22] lord lord these are the foolish virgins
[28:24] came up said lord open to us
[28:26] and he answered and said verily i say
[28:28] unto you i know you're not
[28:31] watch therefore for ye know neither the
[28:33] day
[28:34] nor the hour wherein the son of man
[28:38] cometh amen you may have your seeds
[28:49] very known scripture who knows that
[28:52] scripture who's read the scripture
[28:54] everybody has read that scripture
[28:55] tonight right it's a very
[28:58] something we should be all familiar with
[28:59] the parable of the wise and foolish
[29:01] virgins and i just want to
[29:03] we'll focus on verse 13 in the amplified
[29:06] says
[29:06] therefore be on the alert
[29:10] be prepared and ready okay
[29:14] be prepared and ready for you do not
[29:16] know the day nor the hour
[29:17] when the son of man will come being
[29:19] prepared i just want to speak on that
[29:21] tonight
[29:21] i was titled a little uh message tonight
[29:24] prepared for life
[29:26] and being being prepared it's actually
[29:28] preparations a pretty vital
[29:29] aspect in in life you know being
[29:31] prepared it's actually vital for success
[29:34] in your you know academic life in your
[29:37] business life
[29:38] whichever preparation is key to uh
[29:41] you know to to success at the as i say
[29:44] and actually some say it actually proves
[29:45] to be maybe one of the most
[29:46] valuable skills that you can master and
[29:49] to avoid a lot of build up of
[29:51] well stress and anxiety and and such
[29:54] that comes
[29:54] you know you have a due date or a
[29:56] deadline you got something to be done
[29:58] and in adequate preparation just creates
[30:01] a whole lot of turmoil
[30:02] right you got you got a deadline to make
[30:04] and because you've left it off or you
[30:06] didn't prepare
[30:07] quite right now you're just backpedaling
[30:09] you're spinning you're
[30:10] you're running and gunning now you have
[30:12] no clue what's going to work what does
[30:13] work
[30:14] it's because you didn't prepare
[30:16] preparation is
[30:17] it isn't something that's built in is
[30:20] some have come
[30:21] it comes easier but thankfully you can
[30:23] actually
[30:25] build that skill okay you can build
[30:27] preparation it can be learned
[30:29] comes a little discipline a little
[30:31] discipline and it can improve over time
[30:34] you work on that preparing uh you know
[30:36] bit there if it comes
[30:37] more difficult to you so preparation is
[30:39] key and it's actually the difference
[30:41] between
[30:42] being proactive and reactive right so if
[30:45] you prepare
[30:48] if something happens or you can actually
[30:49] be proactive in the situation
[30:52] because you're you're already ready for
[30:53] it you've kind of already seen all the
[30:55] different scenarios
[30:56] and you're like well this happens i'm
[30:57] going to do that if this happens i got
[30:59] this in my back pocket
[31:00] and if that happens i'm going this
[31:02] direction because you've thought it
[31:03] through
[31:04] you've prepared right if you don't
[31:06] prepare you're just reacting problem
[31:08] fire problem fire and you're trying to
[31:10] put it out
[31:11] and you're reacting it's because lack of
[31:14] preparation
[31:16] preparation takes time a lot of time
[31:20] because you've got to actually set aside
[31:21] for maybe the the key task or tasks you
[31:23] got to do for that day
[31:25] and you got to take time out of your day
[31:27] to prepare some of them say actually at
[31:29] the end of a day
[31:30] some say at three o'clock in the day
[31:32] maybe just before you're going to bed
[31:34] you take some time and you think about
[31:36] the day tomorrow
[31:38] and he said what do i gotta done in that
[31:39] day what's my most important
[31:41] tasks in that day and you lay them out
[31:43] some say you put your
[31:44] three most imp three most important
[31:46] tasks and then the vital task
[31:48] and these are all this this isn't a
[31:49] business class but this is preparation
[31:52] take that take that home and you'll be
[31:55] winning all the way to the bank
[31:58] no pun there all right
[32:03] preparation so many things take prep a
[32:06] lot of preparation you know buildings
[32:07] building a building
[32:08] major preparation years years in the
[32:10] making my brother's
[32:12] part part of that in in building and and
[32:14] some of these these projects that
[32:15] they're doing
[32:16] are five six seven eight years in the
[32:18] making as they go from beginning
[32:20] to end and it takes a ton of planning
[32:23] i've had some
[32:24] some experience in the film side of
[32:25] things and the planning it takes to
[32:27] bring a film
[32:28] to pass is incredible there could be
[32:30] there's
[32:31] upwards up to sometimes seven years
[32:32] before it even hits
[32:34] a production because they're planning
[32:36] they're preparing
[32:37] so much of the work involved to try and
[32:40] get there in fact production
[32:41] when you're filming something that's the
[32:43] shortest time in a whole project
[32:45] it's the shortest part of getting the
[32:47] camera out there and filming something
[32:49] it's it's the narrowest wedge of time
[32:51] the planning
[32:52] is actually one of the biggest right
[32:54] it's the preparing
[32:56] so it's a major it's very important to
[32:58] prepare and even nature itself struggles
[33:01] and prepares just so they can live
[33:05] nature struggles and just so they can
[33:07] prepare we got
[33:08] if you there's a whole herd of elephants
[33:11] in
[33:11] in africa that that they all they're
[33:14] focused on is
[33:15] making their way these great migrations
[33:16] and all they're doing is trying to find
[33:18] water
[33:18] they're moving from place to place and
[33:19] they're they're just that's all they're
[33:21] focused on
[33:22] and they got instinct is telling them i
[33:23] got to go here i got to hear it and all
[33:25] they're doing a bear he hibernates he
[33:26] just fills up his belly with fish he's
[33:28] preparing for something
[33:29] just just to live that's all he's doing
[33:32] he's preparing
[33:33] to live right what about
[33:37] what about a human what about us that's
[33:40] what i want to talk about is where are
[33:41] we
[33:42] in our preparations because we're not
[33:44] just preparing to
[33:45] to fill our bellies with salmon and
[33:47] berries right
[33:49] we're actually preparing for something
[33:50] greater than that
[33:52] all right you know where
[33:55] people put a lot of preparedness in is
[33:58] disasters
[34:00] we've got disaster plans we've got
[34:03] medical evac plans fire prevention plans
[34:07] we've got plans because they're
[34:09] preparing for the worst
[34:11] disaster is going to strike and so we
[34:14] plan
[34:15] we prepare but in all these preparations
[34:18] in whatever aspect in life so many times
[34:20] though
[34:21] we just come up with a whole lot of
[34:23] excuses
[34:24] right many common common excuses and in
[34:27] lack of planning and lack of preparation
[34:30] in the world is well i don't have money
[34:34] and i can't afford to prepare because it
[34:36] takes some money to go and buy certain
[34:38] things and get prepared you know
[34:40] cleaners go out there and get their go
[34:41] kit ready and they've got all their
[34:43] equipment in there
[34:44] that's my go bag it's stashed away it's
[34:46] got all my first aid and some food and
[34:48] you know compass and knife and this i'm
[34:50] ready disaster strike there i'm a go bag
[34:52] it costs money to do that i don't have
[34:54] money so there's no go bag for me
[34:58] another reason i said well you know it's
[35:00] not my responsibility i should actually
[35:02] my mom and dad's responsibility
[35:03] i don't need to prepare or it's my
[35:05] boss's responsibility or somebody's
[35:07] responsibility and so
[35:08] they should take care of it i don't need
[35:10] to they prepare
[35:12] not me and therefore you are unprepared
[35:17] third and common one well it'll never
[35:20] happen to me
[35:22] right it's not gonna happen to me i
[35:24] don't need to prepare for that
[35:26] it's way out it's in the realm of
[35:28] absurdity that something
[35:29] so you know a disaster or whatever it
[35:31] could be
[35:32] might happen to them and so they put
[35:33] that off as it ain't it's just not
[35:35] happening and therefore
[35:37] i'm not preparing all right and as the
[35:40] old saying says as many would you know
[35:43] poor planning on your part does not
[35:45] necessitate an emergency
[35:47] on mine who's heard that one oh now you
[35:50] have
[35:51] it's a very very common proverb record
[35:54] you've got i've heard that
[35:56] yes everybody knows that saying right
[35:58] i'll say it again because apparently
[35:59] none of you heard it poor planning on
[36:01] your part
[36:01] doesn't necessitate an emergency on mine
[36:04] meaning you're you're i don't need to be
[36:06] tapping to your tune
[36:08] because you didn't prepare right okay so
[36:10] preparing ben franklin says by failing
[36:12] to prepare
[36:13] you prepare to fail
[36:16] there you go now all right
[36:20] now you've got your short lesson on
[36:21] preparation all right
[36:23] the importance of it but you know so for
[36:26] the unprepared
[36:27] the world has put together the response
[36:30] systems as we're talking about disasters
[36:32] and they have these
[36:33] early warning systems because they need
[36:35] to they know there's
[36:37] thousands if not millions of unprepared
[36:39] there's no because of these three
[36:41] reasons here most people fall into them
[36:42] and therefore
[36:43] they don't do nothing and so we gotta
[36:45] figure out we gotta we gotta warn him
[36:46] somehow
[36:47] we have early warning systems now and so
[36:52] we have a few of those the common ones
[36:55] of course
[36:56] which yes uh just one second there
[37:01] can you just go to uh slide two actually
[37:04] there
[37:06] joe i put them out of order
[37:10] i apologize
[37:13] yep earthquakes right earthquakes happen
[37:18] and so we have early or you know early
[37:20] warning systems
[37:21] and that they try to trigger and try to
[37:23] give you heads up
[37:25] because you haven't prepared we're going
[37:26] to give you a heads up that earthquake
[37:28] is coming
[37:29] and so they've got some very finicky
[37:31] systems and you know
[37:32] they try and monitor with accelerometers
[37:35] and size
[37:36] size manometers and communication
[37:38] computers all these different alarms are
[37:39] trying to make sure you know what how
[37:41] can we make these people aware that
[37:43] disaster is going to strike
[37:45] all right so in 2019 there was a there
[37:47] was a
[37:48] ridgecrest i believe that was in uh
[37:50] california i can't quite remember there
[37:51] was two
[37:52] earthquakes on july 4th uh 6.4 and 5.7
[37:56] and the company this isn't it but this
[37:58] is just an image just to stick it in
[38:00] your mind
[38:01] they had an app and they it's called
[38:03] quake alert and out it went
[38:05] and the average user had a warning
[38:08] earthquakes coming average
[38:12] they had 45 seconds to prepare
[38:15] how much preparation you got in 45
[38:17] seconds not much so the best
[38:20] they got right now for an earthquake you
[38:22] got 45 seconds
[38:23] on average to get something in ready go
[38:25] to slide one there joe
[38:29] right tsunamis
[38:32] they happen too big disasters how do we
[38:35] prepare for them some prepare more than
[38:37] others different countries have them
[38:38] more than others some don't have them at
[38:40] all obviously they're landlocked
[38:41] nonetheless the you know countries like
[38:43] japan and such are you know they work
[38:45] very hard
[38:46] and so they have they try to get warning
[38:47] systems they got different things in the
[38:49] ocean and
[38:50] and uh buoys and all that try and
[38:51] trigger you know wave height as the
[38:53] water rose you know and
[38:55] trigger things off and so they try to
[38:57] it's sophisticated
[38:59] not sophisticated enough that they
[39:01] didn't give them a heads up because at
[39:02] the earthquake
[39:03] um in i believe is indonesia at 603 pm
[39:07] earthquake hit
[39:08] and the three waves of the tsunami hit
[39:10] the coast
[39:11] from 610 to 6 18 so they had
[39:15] about eight minutes
[39:18] seven eight nine that's all they had to
[39:20] get ready
[39:21] for the onslaught of the tsunami experts
[39:23] say actually that if you see the ocean
[39:25] receding
[39:26] you've got five minutes you better get
[39:28] moving to high ground
[39:30] it's not a lot of time it's not a lot of
[39:33] time because actually if anybody has
[39:34] ever seen
[39:35] the footage that wave just just keeps
[39:37] pushing in and it's going fast
[39:40] five minutes ain't getting you nowhere
[39:43] and we can go to slide three
[39:46] yep sure
[39:50] we'll hit play
[39:55] tornadoes
[39:59] powerful disasters
[40:03] i would just i just i had to put a clip
[40:04] together because when you're seeing the
[40:06] sights of these actually images i just
[40:07] like
[40:08] whoa
[40:21] typically you got less than 15 minutes
[40:25] when a tornado drops down and some
[40:29] they had really just a matter of minutes
[40:30] from when they got a little alert on
[40:32] their phone saying
[40:33] tornadoes just in your area that they
[40:36] had to get down below
[40:37] and that big cloud and cyclone dropped
[40:41] in and tore their house right off
[40:44] so it's a uh these are real people live
[40:48] in these moments this isn't just uh you
[40:49] know
[40:50] pretend you're these are these are real
[40:52] and they're trying to figure out how do
[40:53] we warn people
[40:55] how do we warn you that this is coming
[40:58] so that you can prepare right
[41:02] so this is natural life let's push that
[41:05] aside
[41:06] because it's temporal this is just
[41:08] temporal
[41:10] all right you're gonna have to give me
[41:11] some more amens than that
[41:14] all right but who's preparing for after
[41:17] this who's preparing for after this
[41:20] let's just go that's where
[41:21] we're going to go there right hard
[41:23] because that's really what's
[41:25] most important you can see you can see
[41:27] that the people are preparing for that
[41:28] they're putting their lifetime in how
[41:30] can they track that and they drive
[41:31] around
[41:31] and put their little sensors down and
[41:33] try and figure out how is it how do we
[41:35] monitor this and get all the scientific
[41:36] data just so they can maybe give
[41:38] somebody a few extra minutes
[41:41] so they can actually get out of their
[41:42] home right
[41:44] but god has an early warning system
[41:48] for us because we're talking eternity
[41:50] now
[41:51] okay and i sure hope we don't got just
[41:54] five minutes or five seconds
[41:57] not the case gone as an early warning
[41:59] system it's called
[42:00] a watchman it's called a prophet
[42:05] that he can stand on a tower and look
[42:08] far in advance
[42:10] so you go more than five minutes or
[42:12] eight seconds or whatever it is
[42:14] for a disaster to strike
[42:17] okay so a watchman but abram
[42:20] speaks the message watchmen what of the
[42:22] night because
[42:24] in a watchman if somebody is able to
[42:25] look far far in the distance
[42:27] and warn of an oncoming storm
[42:31] or an oncoming tragedy or such and so
[42:34] they were on a tower and they could see
[42:35] far often so they'd be able to announce
[42:37] to people the danger and pending dangers
[42:39] coming
[42:39] and so they would be able to have time
[42:41] to prepare for that
[42:42] get in the city shut the city gates get
[42:45] inside
[42:46] i also talked about a watchman being
[42:48] able to tell even the time you know
[42:49] what's the time he said there you know
[42:50] they should they knew the stars and
[42:52] stuff you could shut up you know what
[42:53] what hour what hour is it but how are we
[42:55] in
[42:57] is it morning time is it evening time
[42:59] what time is it in the night time they
[43:01] didn't have
[43:02] watchers like you and me right but i
[43:04] brandon says and today god still has
[43:06] eagles
[43:07] messengers men on the tower who climb up
[43:10] the spirit
[43:11] up in the spirit far beyond all
[43:12] mechanisms and all the atomic bombs and
[43:14] scientific researches
[43:16] he has men whose special design for that
[43:18] purpose
[43:19] who climbs up the ramparts at calvary in
[43:21] the name of the lord jesus stands on the
[43:23] top of the cross
[43:25] doesn't that stands on top of the cross
[43:27] he says and can
[43:28] send the message back thus saith the
[43:31] lord
[43:32] this is our early warning system god's
[43:34] got it built in
[43:36] from all the way from the beginning of
[43:37] time he's got a prophet that has been
[43:39] a warning system over and over to the
[43:42] people
[43:42] in ages gone by and today
[43:46] early warning system a prophet amen a
[43:49] watchman
[43:50] their spiritual sight far greater than
[43:52] the priests in the temple
[43:53] beyond the ordinary men and walks of
[43:55] life their special design for the duties
[43:57] that god had for them and they see afar
[44:00] off
[44:01] isaiah could see a far off he said a
[44:03] virgin so i can see because god
[44:05] gave them that ability amos saw far off
[44:07] and saw destruction coming
[44:09] moses saw far off and said there will be
[44:10] a prophet likened unto me
[44:12] there are prophets they're able to see
[44:14] afar off be ready for this
[44:16] right be ready see things that are
[44:19] coming he sees the cup of god's wrath
[44:22] full before it's filled
[44:26] i think we'd want to know if the cup is
[44:29] if when that right cup of wrath is going
[44:32] to be filled
[44:33] where is it well it's going to be at
[44:35] this time when you see this happen
[44:37] when you see these events when this
[44:38] takes place then that's the time
[44:41] oh i want to be ready for that time
[44:43] right so that's why we wanted to keep
[44:45] our eye on the watchmen of the tower and
[44:47] say watchmen
[44:48] what of the night where are we at is
[44:51] disaster right on us
[44:53] or how much time do i got where are we
[44:56] who's asked the watchman who's looked at
[44:59] and said watch him what is it who's gone
[45:00] in there and said where are we right now
[45:03] is the cup full
[45:06] do i have seconds do i have minutes
[45:09] the watchman can tell you he can tell
[45:12] you what's coming or not
[45:14] he can tell you the world be dark gross
[45:16] darkness he's high up enough
[45:18] the sun's shining now but he sees that
[45:19] shade coming
[45:21] and he says he's saying what's he's look
[45:22] he says what he's looking at it ain't
[45:24] here yet
[45:25] but it'll sure be here that's right he
[45:27] knows it's coming
[45:29] years away years away yet he sees it
[45:32] i just thought you know my what was
[45:35] spoken that was coming
[45:37] years away and there's many things i
[45:39] could go on here and i
[45:40] don't i'm not going to labor more on uh
[45:44] on some of these but i was just saying
[45:45] this you know brother branham saw so
[45:47] many things and if you read the message
[45:48] wow he's he's speaking about then but
[45:51] he's speaking them but he that's got to
[45:53] be
[45:54] now he's like that's now some of them
[45:56] are simple because
[45:58] um what is my next slide can you go back
[46:01] out i want to make sure i got these in
[46:02] order
[46:04] yeah let's do that one slide five
[46:07] okay this is simple we got we got
[46:10] children
[46:10] we got to bring this tangible for them
[46:12] but our brandon he had seven visions
[46:15] i'm not going to go into every single
[46:16] one of them but one of them was cars he
[46:18] spoke about cards he said just before
[46:19] that time come that automobiles
[46:21] this is where you can dig in and you
[46:23] roll into the message and find out the
[46:24] rest
[46:25] wow i didn't know about that you dig in
[46:26] there he says
[46:28] in israel in the church number two he
[46:29] says what uh automobiles which was built
[46:32] that old straight back 20 years ago he
[46:34] said he was talking about the
[46:35] when he had the uh divisions and i said
[46:39] i said to look like an egg okay he said
[46:42] to look like an egg so he's talking in
[46:44] cars
[46:44] down the road are gonna look like an egg
[46:46] at the end time okay that's what he said
[46:47] he says
[46:48] be something on the shape of something
[46:49] like that that's the way that'll be
[46:52] just before the rapture okay
[46:55] this is he's this is the these are the
[46:56] cars he's talking about then
[46:58] not so egg-shaped okay we're talking
[47:02] like boxy
[47:03] big time big sharp edges and you can
[47:06] imagine the audience is like like an egg
[47:08] do you see our cars right now right
[47:11] yeah i know you're living right now in
[47:12] in shape cars you can click next
[47:15] actually i could probably do that too
[47:16] right i had to put that up there because
[47:18] come on that's as how about i just took
[47:21] a picture
[47:22] of an egg
[47:28] i did not distort that one bit
[47:31] just so you know nothing i just whoop
[47:34] got bigger
[47:35] i mean it was so exact to the egg
[47:37] curvature
[47:38] i was like wow it does not get that does
[47:41] not get more accurate than that okay
[47:43] this is just just to give an idea this
[47:45] is the watchman in the small
[47:47] but also then in the great okay in all
[47:50] of the different areas but brother
[47:52] branham talks about you look at civil
[47:53] unrest and all the
[47:54] different things that are going on right
[47:55] now he speaks about that and he talks
[47:57] about it now coming down this day and
[47:59] age
[47:59] he talks about how it's used he said
[48:01] communism will come right in there
[48:02] this is what he says yeah he says that
[48:05] he says they do that they start a little
[48:06] revolution
[48:07] then they take then they take it in
[48:09] without a shot he says they don't want
[48:10] to blow the country up they want it they
[48:12] wormweeded in
[48:13] and they seen in a case of doing they
[48:14] said and now what the old revolution was
[48:16] they start just another revolution
[48:18] and they just filter that in this is
[48:20] only the watchman
[48:23] where are we at
[48:26] let's go to the next slide
[48:29] right music my goodness now what about
[48:32] all this carrying on and done he says
[48:35] in the name of the church practicing
[48:36] square dancing in the church bunco
[48:38] bengal parties teenagers rock and roll
[48:40] look at this elvis presley the devil
[48:42] standing in shoes
[48:45] now that's as strong as it gets pat
[48:47] boone ricky nelson
[48:49] biggest indictment to this nature ever
[48:50] had that's right i i had to look at them
[48:52] and be like
[48:53] wow this is the devil standing in shoes
[48:56] here at the bottom
[48:57] for those that don't know i think it's
[48:59] ricky nelson at the top and
[49:01] pat boone in the middle and and all
[49:02] these other ones you know louis
[49:03] armstrong and
[49:04] hank williams and you know ray charles
[49:06] you know
[49:07] patsy clan i don't even know these
[49:09] people but i'm looking at them like the
[49:11] devil
[49:11] this is what they were looking at as the
[49:14] watchmen of the night
[49:16] the prophet is saying this though i
[49:18] can't even put the second slide
[49:20] i i didn't even make one for music in
[49:22] this day
[49:24] because that indeed is the devil in
[49:25] shoes
[49:27] and i wasn't even comfortable showing
[49:28] the devil in shoes on the screen
[49:31] horrible demon possessed but this is

[50:32] where their attraction is on christ and
[50:34] single-minded they'll go after that
[50:35] stuff
[50:36] this is where um and they'll act like
[50:38] those people he says it used to be the
[50:40] old pentecostal wouldn't let their
[50:41] children even go to picture shows and
[50:42] the devil pulled one over on their eyes
[50:44] and brought the picture show right in
[50:45] the house
[50:47] he brought these picture shows in the
[50:48] house this is what he's preaching hard
[50:50] against
[50:51] and i was looking at them and ren tin
[50:54] tin
[50:55] a little dog gun smoke you know some
[50:58] cowboys and
[51:00] you're like brother brad no no he's
[51:03] looking at now
[51:04] on your device on your little youtube
[51:06] and on your
[51:07] demon demon inspired
[51:10] content a prophet
[51:14] a watchman warning
[51:17] warning all right
[51:24] not just there but then we start talking
[51:27] and watchmen is also
[51:28] revealing the mysteries he's showing you
[51:30] serpent seed revealing godhead
[51:32] the church changes all this i'm just i
[51:34] just got something a little
[51:36] more that i could help the kids even see
[51:38] this is what your watchman is doing if
[51:39] he's showing you that
[51:41] and far down the road what more is he
[51:43] showing what more is he reaching to and
[51:44] saying
[51:45] look at this okay
[51:49] so now a warning there's a warning
[51:52] butter branham says oh
[51:54] he says it pays to take warning you can
[51:57] take that down there
[51:58] but joe the first thing you do
[52:05] before there can be a warning there has
[52:08] to be a preparation
[52:11] made for safety or there's no need of a
[52:14] warning
[52:16] if there's no way of escape if there's
[52:18] no if why am i even going to warn you
[52:21] if there's no if there if you're on a
[52:22] train trestle
[52:24] and there's a train coming and you're in
[52:25] the middle of it and the only way is
[52:27] that way or the train there's a train
[52:29] coming i mean
[52:30] yeah i am dead either way what's the
[52:34] point of the warning
[52:34] but if there was a way of escape then i
[52:37] would be shouting at you
[52:39] and trying to warn you to go that
[52:40] direction prepare you can get away from
[52:42] that
[52:43] right so if what's the point of the
[52:45] warning if there was no preparation made
[52:48] and you and the warning is only a voice
[52:51] of one having you to prepare for the
[52:53] danger
[52:53] there has to be a preparation made first
[52:56] amen
[52:57] preparation made first i'm thankful
[53:01] there's a preparation made amen that's
[53:03] what we're talking about tonight there's
[53:05] a preparation available
[53:06] he's warning judgment is coming
[53:11] but he's giving there's a way out amen
[53:13] there's a way out
[53:15] warning preparation then judgment let's
[53:18] just talk about a couple of those that
[53:19] can be real tangible for you
[53:21] noah warning said and god looked upon
[53:24] the earth
[53:25] and behold it was corrupt for all the
[53:27] flesh had corrupted his way upon the
[53:28] earth and god said to noah the end of
[53:30] all flesh has come before me for the
[53:31] earth is filled with violence
[53:33] through them and behold i'll destroy
[53:34] them with the earth
[53:36] warning all right
[53:40] prepare make thee an ark of gopher wood
[53:43] rooms thou shalt make in the ark and
[53:45] shalt pitch it within and without
[53:47] and this is the fashion which thou shalt
[53:49] make it the length of the ark shall be
[53:50] 300 cubits
[53:51] breadth of it 50 cubits height of its 30
[53:53] cubits you'll make a window in it i in
[53:55] prayer phase and then you'd put a door
[53:57] and then there'll be a lower second and
[53:59] third stories thou shalt make it
[54:01] here's what you do here's how you
[54:03] prepare for the warning
[54:05] and noah had to go into action and start
[54:08] to prepare
[54:10] and he had years now he had to work he
[54:11] had to go get the gopher wood he had to
[54:13] go find that
[54:14] he'd start cutting it down he had to get
[54:15] his boys on board hey let's go boys we
[54:17] got a whole lot of work to do
[54:18] we got a big boat on our hands we got to
[54:21] get her done
[54:22] because judgment is coming warning and
[54:24] then judgment right
[54:25] and so here they go they start working
[54:28] hour after hour day after day service
[54:31] after service
[54:32] wednesday after wednesday right
[54:36] preparation was being made on the ark so
[54:38] that eight
[54:39] souls could be taken to safety
[54:43] god rich in mercy giving noah in his
[54:46] time that he
[54:47] everybody had it available to them this
[54:48] wasn't a secluded ark it was there
[54:50] big big and huge available
[54:54] i mean it just reeked of warning on it
[54:56] something major is happening
[54:57] but they didn't take it they didn't heed
[55:01] the warning they didn't heed the warning
[55:06] and then there was judgment in the 600th
[55:08] year of noah's life the second month 17
[55:09] day of the month the same day where all
[55:11] the foundations
[55:12] fountains of the great deep broken up
[55:13] and the windows of heaven
[55:15] are opened and judgment struck in noah's
[55:18] day
[55:22] i don't look at noah like doom don't get
[55:24] old i was heavy
[55:25] oh no no god made a way of escape he
[55:28] gave
[55:29] a warning and he said here's what you
[55:30] got to do get to work
[55:32] do it this way do it that way well i
[55:34] think i'm going to cut it in half and
[55:35] not do it quite that no it wouldn't have
[55:36] worked
[55:37] god had a set plan for him make it three
[55:40] stories put one window up put a door
[55:42] here and i know i'm going to put like 40
[55:43] doors
[55:44] it wouldn't have worked because it
[55:45] didn't go according to god's plan and it
[55:47] would have sunk
[55:48] noah had to prepare exactly the way god
[55:51] had it
[55:51] made for him to do and so he got to work
[55:53] doing that and he floated to safety
[55:56] and spared their life and a way of
[55:58] escape that to me
[55:59] is glorious don't look at noah like oh
[56:02] my goodness the world ended no eight
[56:04] souls were saved because they heeded
[56:06] the warning and prepared according to
[56:09] his word
[56:10] all right let's get that let that drill
[56:12] through our hearts
[56:14] tonight amen
[56:20] in exodus we'll talk about another one
[56:23] very these are very known
[56:26] these are all through the bible exodus
[56:27] 12 we know of the passover
[56:31] you know the day before passover is
[56:32] called the day of preparation
[56:34] they're preparing for it they've got a
[56:37] lot of things they've got to do they
[56:37] can't
[56:38] cook and so so forth there's certain
[56:40] things that are prepared so the day
[56:41] before is actually the day of
[56:42] preparation
[56:43] exodus 12
[56:46] there was a warning god said the death
[56:49] angel is coming in
[56:50] and the firstborn is going to die all
[56:53] right
[56:56] now you must prepare and then there was
[56:58] a preparation now
[56:59] involved right and he gave him very
[57:02] specific
[57:03] parameters here's how you prepare for
[57:05] this
[57:06] death is coming now we must
[57:09] you can be saved from it here's how it
[57:11] works
[57:12] okay and he said you take a lamb
[57:16] without blemish male of the first year
[57:19] you take it from out of the sheep or
[57:21] from the goats
[57:22] and you shall keep it until the 14th day
[57:25] it actually says
[57:26] you'll take it without blemish and i
[57:27] want to say it says on the 10th day of
[57:29] the month
[57:30] in the 10th day monday she'll take them
[57:31] every man a lamb so on day 10
[57:33] of that month they took a lamb all right
[57:35] they had to select it they had to go out
[57:37] and do it okay you had to go do
[57:38] something
[57:38] they had to go out there okay son get
[57:40] out there go look at lamb they might
[57:41] have a big herd
[57:42] go look at this one yeah no they brought
[57:43] them in flipped them up look at them
[57:45] yeah this one looks great
[57:46] is he one year old they had to know this
[57:48] had to be one year old
[57:49] not two-year-old not six months
[57:53] it wouldn't work god wouldn't have
[57:55] accepted the sacrifice
[57:56] if it was six months old or to five
[57:58] years old
[57:59] one year old blemish is there a blemish
[58:02] on here
[58:03] look at all around the legs up around
[58:04] the firm fur cur you know trying to
[58:06] frantically look we need the right one
[58:08] that we need the right lamb
[58:10] for one year old no blemish a male
[58:13] we need to prepare and so here they are
[58:16] they're preparing
[58:17] they didn't keep it four days nothing
[58:19] could happen to it you didn't want to
[58:20] have that lamp pick it out it's all
[58:21] perfect
[58:22] and then it stubs his leg breaks it
[58:25] scratches it whatever
[58:26] it's not it's not it's a blemish lamb
[58:28] now
[58:29] so we had to keep it from day 10 because
[58:31] his fort on day 14
[58:33] is when they needed to give sacrifice
[58:36] kill the lamb in evening time take the
[58:38] blood strike the posts
[58:42] roasted eat the flesh the pertinent
[58:44] parts all through the night
[58:46] nothing remained in the morning if so
[58:48] then it was burned
[58:49] they stayed up at night there was
[58:51] preparation
[58:52] involved so the death angel would not
[58:55] strike their home
[58:57] preparation we're talking preparing all
[58:59] right
[59:00] no leaven no leaven in the home
[59:04] nothing for the next seven days
[59:07] right what's 11 children what's 11 you
[59:10] gotta know
[59:11] tell me have no clue
[59:15] it's yeast it's like a yeast it's a
[59:17] raisin compound you know what it does
[59:19] leaven it's using doughs and batters
[59:22] it it's a it has a foaming action and it
[59:24] lightens and softens the mixture
[59:27] god has no desire to lighten and soften
[59:29] his word zippo
[59:30] it's this is what it is it's hard
[59:33] sometimes he wants it uncontaminated
[59:35] with the world
[59:36] no leaven and they had to make sure
[59:38] there was nothing
[59:39] in the home and anywhere else they went
[59:41] through every room
[59:42] every crook every cranny every shelf
[59:45] every basket you name it they went
[59:46] through it because there had to be
[59:47] nothing
[59:48] zippo for seven days no 11. why in 11
[59:52] why seven days but abram says seven
[59:54] church ages
[59:55] the types are beautiful you see just
[59:57] read over that in the scripture like oh
[59:58] seven days you had no 11. oh that was
[1:00:00] pretty tough no no no
[1:00:01] because the type couldn't be broken
[1:00:03] right the scripture had to work all the
[1:00:05] way through front to back
[1:00:07] so that we could believe and say that's
[1:00:08] the truth he's the same yesterday
[1:00:10] today and forever the types and the
[1:00:12] shadows work beautifully all
[1:00:14] the way from the beginning to end amen
[1:00:16] seven days seven days seven ages no
[1:00:18] extra ideas
[1:00:19] no additional creeds no i think this
[1:00:21] this is how i think it is
[1:00:22] oh it's trinity oh it's this no no no
[1:00:24] nothing
[1:00:25] zero eleven zero man's concepts it had
[1:00:28] to be pure
[1:00:29] word amen
[1:00:34] because death was in the land
[1:00:42] amen
[1:00:46] death was in the land one small amount
[1:00:50] of the world
[1:00:51] not even a little bit it wasn't 99 one
[1:00:54] little
[1:00:56] dust particle it had to be swept out and
[1:00:58] you prepared
[1:00:59] exactly scripture says your glory is not
[1:01:02] good
[1:01:03] no you not that a little leaveneth 11 11
[1:01:06] is the whole
[1:01:06] lump so purge out therefore the old
[1:01:08] leaven that ye may be
[1:01:10] a new lump as ye are unleavened for even
[1:01:12] christ our passover
[1:01:14] is sacrificed for us nothing
[1:01:17] not a bit of the world everything
[1:01:18] scoured completely
[1:01:21] swept out that's how your life must be
[1:01:24] nothing
[1:01:26] nothing well daddy
[1:01:29] why do you got your shoes on they got
[1:01:31] there at now at midnight
[1:01:33] it's night time death angel came at
[1:01:35] midnight
[1:01:37] this wasn't like i'm tired oh nobody was
[1:01:39] tired that night
[1:01:40] they were working they were preparing to
[1:01:42] make sure he said well daddy why do you
[1:01:43] got your shoes on
[1:01:44] why do your staff in your hand why have
[1:01:45] you got piece of bread in one hand
[1:01:47] and lamb in the other why are there
[1:01:48] bitter herbs and things what are you
[1:01:50] eating
[1:01:50] what's that sweat running off your face
[1:01:54] because it was a desperate time of
[1:01:56] preparation because
[1:01:57] the death angel was coming amen it was a
[1:02:01] vital time to make sure you had
[1:02:03] everything right
[1:02:06] you didn't want it left by chance but
[1:02:08] dad wanted it left by chance
[1:02:10] no wonder his sweat going off his brow
[1:02:12] he gird up his loins
[1:02:13] he had a staff in his hand he was ready
[1:02:14] to go he's eating the bitter herbs he's
[1:02:16] eaten everything
[1:02:17] some of it's hard some of it's good but
[1:02:19] he had to eat it all the pertinent parts
[1:02:21] right sometimes sometimes services are a
[1:02:23] little bit this
[1:02:25] it's the hard parts too other times it's
[1:02:26] glory it's amazing
[1:02:28] you have to eat it all it's all word
[1:02:30] right you're girded up and ready to go
[1:02:32] you weren't leaving it to chance
[1:02:34] because if it was just left a chance and
[1:02:36] you did get a year and a half year old
[1:02:38] guess who was dying at midnight
[1:02:41] your firstborn was it serious it was
[1:02:44] serious
[1:02:45] procrastination would have been a
[1:02:47] horrible thing then
[1:02:48] well i'll just let it go you know you
[1:02:51] know
[1:02:51] day 10 you know i can do all that on day
[1:02:54] 13.
[1:02:56] no that would have been a bad end you
[1:02:59] want to procrastinate
[1:03:00] and leave it off no sir
[1:03:04] no sir scripture says now
[1:03:09] again he said wow passover is a heavy
[1:03:12] story it is a heavy account
[1:03:14] but i want you to focus on there was a
[1:03:16] way out
[1:03:18] there was preparation a warning that
[1:03:20] allowed preparation
[1:03:21] so that life could be preserved focus on
[1:03:24] that
[1:03:25] life could be preserved there was a
[1:03:26] preparation for life
[1:03:29] okay to get away from the death that was
[1:03:31] coming on the land
[1:03:32] you can prepare and live
[1:03:35] and you can do nothing and die let's
[1:03:38] focus on live
[1:03:40] because there's a way now
[1:03:43] a lot of times through these preparing
[1:03:45] times
[1:03:46] uh we can it there's
[1:03:50] can be a long period of time here we
[1:03:52] talked about disasters and
[1:03:53] you know a few minutes of time between
[1:03:55] warning and then and then
[1:03:57] and then destruction but sometimes it's
[1:03:59] a lot longer than that
[1:04:01] so much so the scripture says ii peter 3
[1:04:04] knowing this first that there shall come
[1:04:06] in the last days scoffers
[1:04:08] walking after their own lust and saying
[1:04:10] where is the promise of his coming
[1:04:13] yeah we've been at this a long time
[1:04:16] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[1:04:18] things continue as they were from the
[1:04:20] beginning
[1:04:21] of creation yeah i've heard this 40
[1:04:24] 000 times that's what they're saying
[1:04:28] rapture yeah i don't know where's the
[1:04:31] promise of his coming
[1:04:33] yeah it's scripture i can tell you
[1:04:37] it's happened to this day absolutely
[1:04:41] willingly they were ignorant that by the
[1:04:44] word of god the heavens were
[1:04:45] were of old and the earth standing out
[1:04:46] of the water and in the water whereby
[1:04:48] the world that was
[1:04:49] that then was being overflowed with
[1:04:50] water and they perished
[1:04:54] god wants to know if it's really
[1:04:55] sticking
[1:04:57] no you're in it for the long haul not
[1:05:00] for the short haul
[1:05:01] all right and so he looked like he even
[1:05:03] put noah through all that preparation
[1:05:05] time and then he put him in the ark
[1:05:07] and then he sat there and waited
[1:05:10] hey the rain's coming the door's shut
[1:05:11] the animal's ready we're ready to go
[1:05:13] it's been a long time
[1:05:14] a whole lot of years and i'm ready to go
[1:05:16] i'm waiting to hear the thunder
[1:05:17] and day one happens then there's no
[1:05:19] thunder
[1:05:21] and he's two days done and three days
[1:05:24] and four days that's a long time and you
[1:05:27] i'm sure you got a whole lot of mockery
[1:05:28] going on the outside right he left it
[1:05:30] for seven days before that thunder
[1:05:32] started
[1:05:32] and then the rain fell right scripture
[1:05:35] says for the vision is yet for an
[1:05:36] appointed time
[1:05:37] but at the end it shall speak and not
[1:05:40] lie
[1:05:41] hold fast scripture is scripture
[1:05:44] it will not fail though it terry wait
[1:05:47] for it
[1:05:48] because it'll surely come it will not
[1:05:51] terry don't
[1:05:54] falter in this gap time hold fast
[1:05:59] you've prepared many of you you've
[1:06:01] prepared i'm not talking i'm talking to

[1:06:22] a mistake and there was no way out
[1:06:24] preparation was done
[1:06:27] we want to be in the ark that's why
[1:06:29] we're here
[1:06:30] that's why the watchmen came because he
[1:06:32] could shout out a message and say

[1:06:36] where the word is
[1:06:37] get there amen that's what we're

[1:06:45] how to know who he was when he had to do
[1:06:46] that
[1:06:47] and so did many of god's men we
[1:06:48] mentioned the different prophets they
[1:06:49] didn't know who they were
[1:06:50] right brother dan they didn't know who
[1:06:52] they were when they're speaking amos
[1:06:53] getting out there isaiah getting out

[1:07:08] the vision will manifest
[1:07:10] amen those that got tired they didn't
[1:07:13] listen to jesus
[1:07:14] jesus said when you see certain certain
[1:07:16] things happen
[1:07:17] when you see jerusalem compass with
[1:07:19] armies and know that the desolation
[1:07:20] there was nigh
[1:07:21] flee to the mountains he says for the
[1:07:24] days of vengeance
[1:07:25] are coming woe into them with child that
[1:07:27] gives suck in those days and
[1:07:28] great shall be the distress he told them
[1:07:30] watch for this
[1:07:32] he told them get out of jerusalem when
[1:07:34] you see this happen
[1:07:36] and those that heeded the warning and
[1:07:39] were watching and prepared
[1:07:40] yeah yup yup i see it happening we're
[1:07:42] gone
[1:07:43] they had stuff where they had gold bags
[1:07:45] they were ready to go
[1:07:47] 37 years later is when that happened
[1:07:51] to make sure that gold bag was ready to
[1:07:53] go when they had to tear out of the city
[1:07:55] because their roman was coming in and
[1:07:57] you know what they say
[1:07:58] more than 1.1 million jews perished
[1:08:04] 100 000 taken captive they said though
[1:08:08] yet while the jews suffered starvation
[1:08:10] and slaughter and capture
[1:08:11] their fellow christians in jerusalem
[1:08:14] escaped
[1:08:15] amen they prepared for life
[1:08:18] they were prepared oh you say
[1:08:22] i don't want to be here well that's why
[1:08:24] we're here
[1:08:25] you know god doesn't put you through a
[1:08:28] rigorous set
[1:08:29] of you've got to do this do this this
[1:08:31] this and you know what after 10 or 15
[1:08:33] years
[1:08:34] then i'll see if you've passed the past
[1:08:36] my preparation test
[1:08:37] no no they were pricked in their heart
[1:08:40] when peter spoke to them
[1:08:42] and they said what must we do what must
[1:08:45] we do to be saved
[1:08:46] i don't want to be here there's an
[1:08:48] oncoming storm there's destruction
[1:08:50] coming
[1:08:51] i gotta i want to be ready i need to
[1:08:52] prepare what do i do what do i do
[1:08:55] well he said repent
[1:08:59] be baptized amen and you shall receive
[1:09:02] the gift
[1:09:03] of the holy ghost amen it would that's
[1:09:06] it wasn't it's not super simple that's
[1:09:08] why that's why god
[1:09:09] hates the catholic doctrine and all of
[1:09:12] the dogmas that put prices on it and you
[1:09:14] have to do this
[1:09:15] whip yourself whip yourself pray this
[1:09:17] many times light this many candles
[1:09:18] because it's a free gift
[1:09:20] he says all you got to do is repent turn
[1:09:23] around
[1:09:24] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:09:26] in my name on my name his name
[1:09:28] that's what you are i was just thinking
[1:09:30] today how incredible
[1:09:31] in vain do they worship me i was
[1:09:33] thinking because how do you worship him
[1:09:35] brother brown says in his provided
[1:09:37] place of worship which is in jesus
[1:09:39] christ and if they're believing eternity
[1:09:41] doctrine
[1:09:41] and following and baptizing the father
[1:09:43] son of holy ghost how are you worshiping
[1:09:44] him
[1:09:45] how do you worship him when you're
[1:09:47] worshiping in titles
[1:09:49] it's in his name that you worship him
[1:09:51] amen
[1:09:52] that's why you're baptized in his name
[1:09:55] by one spirit
[1:09:56] him are we baptized into and therefore
[1:09:58] then now
[1:09:59] you have the seal amen
[1:10:08] that's why that godhead is so important
[1:10:11] millions and millions of people that
[1:10:13] believe they believe
[1:10:14] and are worshiping not in god's provided
[1:10:17] place of worship
[1:10:18] can you imagine all your worship is in
[1:10:22] vain
[1:10:22] because you're not even worshiping in
[1:10:24] his name
[1:10:26] in the name of our lord jesus my when
[1:10:29] that comes
[1:10:30] no when that seal when god recognizes as
[1:10:33] abraham did
[1:10:33] he separated himself he showed his faith
[1:10:36] and god then circumcised a covenant of
[1:10:38] circumcision
[1:10:39] and then and when god sees that you step
[1:10:41] in you make a consecration you turn
[1:10:42] around you separate yourself
[1:10:44] you you surrender it all you lay it down
[1:10:46] you don't hold nothing back
[1:10:47] god sees that and he pours the holy
[1:10:48] ghost into your life boy
[1:10:50] what a change happens amen you're
[1:10:53] renewed in your nature
[1:10:54] you're completely changed this is what
[1:10:57] this this is what he does
[1:10:58] he changes you your old man is dead it's
[1:11:01] dead your desires are gone your
[1:11:02] worldly passions are gone because he
[1:11:04] died out and he now lives and reigns
[1:11:06] supreme in you he's washed you from your
[1:11:08] sins you're blameless
[1:11:09] he sees you washed completely pure amen
[1:11:12] spotless the blood of the lamb makes you
[1:11:15] perfect
[1:11:16] in his eyes perfect justified by his
[1:11:19] righteousness
[1:11:19] your filthy rags your righteousness are
[1:11:21] covered in his blood and he sees his
[1:11:23] righteousness which is pure white and
[1:11:25] says snow way man you're reconciled to
[1:11:27] god
[1:11:28] made to be just like him because you're
[1:11:30] part of him you've been torn he was tore
[1:11:32] at calvary
[1:11:33] you're the other part of him he's part
[1:11:35] join the ghettos bride and groom
[1:11:36] you make that covenant perfect match
[1:11:38] because he's a part of you
[1:11:40] that's what happens when the god pours
[1:11:44] his spirit in you amen and your lamp
[1:11:49] your vessel is fed with heavenly oil
[1:11:53] which is the holy spirit amen
[1:11:59] now let's talk about
[1:12:02] our scripture
[1:12:06] holy oil holy spirit that oil
[1:12:11] vital for preparation
[1:12:14] what do i need what do i need we got an
[1:12:16] oncoming storm as i said
[1:12:18] we've got destruction coming to this
[1:12:20] world we've just been talking to
[1:12:21] ourselves
[1:12:22] at home and different ones reading in
[1:12:24] revelation this abigail and the kids
[1:12:26] our abigail and inside we're just
[1:12:27] reading a little bit of the sixth seal
[1:12:29] boy oh boy oh boy you don't want to be
[1:12:31] here
[1:12:32] you don't want to be here storm
[1:12:36] storm but there's a way there's a
[1:12:39] prepare
[1:12:40] preparation that can be made so that you
[1:12:42] don't even need to be here
[1:12:43] amen and that's why you're here what are
[1:12:45] you preparing for
[1:12:46] are you preparing for judgment or are
[1:12:48] you preparing for life
[1:12:50] what are you preparing for you have a
[1:12:52] choice you can do it right now what am i
[1:12:53] what am i doing what's my focus right
[1:12:54] now what am i doing in life
[1:12:56] is my am i preparing everything i know
[1:12:58] there's something coming
[1:12:59] i know the watchman has said this well i
[1:13:01] don't have time or
[1:13:02] it's cost too much not money but it
[1:13:04] costs too much of you
[1:13:06] too much of your own self you've got to
[1:13:08] lie down everything in fact not just
[1:13:09] some
[1:13:10] everything ah just too much don't fall
[1:13:13] in
[1:13:13] to the vast majority that do not go
[1:13:16] unprepared
[1:13:18] prepare amen
[1:13:21] five of them were wise five were foolish
[1:13:23] they were foolish took their lamps took
[1:13:25] no oil
[1:13:25] took no oil
[1:13:29] the vital component to preparation but
[1:13:32] the wise took oil
[1:13:33] in their vessels with their lamps and
[1:13:36] while the bridegroom tarried
[1:13:38] he lingered while he lingered
[1:13:41] and tarried they slumbered and slept
[1:13:44] but abraham says all through the ages
[1:13:46] first stage
[1:13:47] second age third age he says and then
[1:13:50] those virgins rose
[1:13:51] oh sorry and at midnight a cry was made
[1:13:55] behold the bridegroom cometh brother
[1:13:57] brown says at the seventh watch
[1:13:59] in that last age he says that cry was
[1:14:01] made out
[1:14:02] at midnight at christ made the
[1:14:04] bridegroom cometh where are we
[1:14:06] we're at the end of the seventh age and
[1:14:08] the
[1:14:09] watchmen has shouted out
[1:14:13] here's what's coming behold the
[1:14:15] bridegroom cometh
[1:14:16] go ye out to meet him and then those
[1:14:19] virgins rose
[1:14:20] and they trimmed their lamps they
[1:14:22] trimmed their lamps they were lamp
[1:14:23] trimming
[1:14:24] you know if you don't trim a wick it
[1:14:26] gets all smoky and
[1:14:28] charred up and your wick and your flame
[1:14:31] is
[1:14:33] minuscule in fact you blow off smoke you
[1:14:36] char
[1:14:36] up the lamp and eventually if you leave
[1:14:38] it it goes out
[1:14:40] and there's nothing happening on your on
[1:14:42] your little wick
[1:14:43] and you need that you need flame so they
[1:14:45] went out and trimmed their lamp they
[1:14:47] trimmed out you know what what have i
[1:14:48] got
[1:14:48] they started any little thing of
[1:14:50] preparation i got to make sure my wick
[1:14:51] is just looking good you actually trim a
[1:14:52] wick in a
[1:14:53] certain way you know not to cut right
[1:14:55] across the top no you want your flame to
[1:14:57] be bright
[1:14:57] and tall and as as powerful as you can
[1:15:00] in your little lamp and so they trim
[1:15:01] that lamp they got rid of anything is
[1:15:03] there a little bit of the world on me
[1:15:04] anything that's hindering my my flame
[1:15:05] from burning bright and so let's just
[1:15:07] trim that off a little bit
[1:15:08] something came across the pulpit on the
[1:15:10] surface i heard so i read something in
[1:15:11] the scripture that says trim that little
[1:15:12] lamp
[1:15:13] that little wick a little bit and you
[1:15:14] make that lamp just burn bright amen
[1:15:17] that's what the trim of the lamp is amen
[1:15:19] so they rose up
[1:15:20] the foolers said under the wise oh give
[1:15:23] us of your oil
[1:15:24] our lamps are gone out this is major
[1:15:27] this was major
[1:15:31] our lamps are gone out my goodness
[1:15:38] lebron says the first thing when he
[1:15:39] starts descending out of heaven
[1:15:41] he says there's a shout what is that
[1:15:43] it's a message
[1:15:44] to get the people together a message
[1:15:46] comes forth
[1:15:47] now lamp trimming time which we just
[1:15:48] talked about rise and trim your lamps
[1:15:51] what watch was that he said seventh
[1:15:52] which we just said behold the bridegroom
[1:15:54] cometh he said it's malachi 4 time
[1:15:56] it's luke 17 time all those prophecies
[1:15:59] that can perfectly set in order and this
[1:16:00] day
[1:16:01] in the scripture we see it living right
[1:16:03] there
[1:16:05] this is where we're at so where are we
[1:16:07] right here
[1:16:08] we're at the end ready those last
[1:16:09] prophecies being fulfilled and now the
[1:16:11] foolish virgins they say whoa
[1:16:13] we're out of oil and the y said
[1:16:17] not so not so
[1:16:20] lest there not be enough for us
[1:16:24] and you but go rather and go over that
[1:16:27] and
[1:16:28] go to them that sell them by yourselves
[1:16:30] i can't give you the holy ghost
[1:16:32] i can't this is i i got just enough for
[1:16:35] me
[1:16:35] i'm trying to live my life i'm trying to
[1:16:37] keep keep my lamp burning bright
[1:16:38] keep my family in order uh-huh oh you
[1:16:40] got to go to the source
[1:16:42] i can't give you my oil you go to the
[1:16:43] source of the oil
[1:16:48] nobody would want to wake up and find
[1:16:50] out that the only requirement that they
[1:16:52] needed when the bridegroom came
[1:16:54] was the oil and they didn't
[1:16:58] have it and when they went to buy
[1:17:02] they weren't already and the wise
[1:17:04] virgins went with him to the marriage
[1:17:06] and the door was shut
[1:17:11] preparation can be made right now
[1:17:14] right now say lord i don't got oil in my
[1:17:17] lamp
[1:17:18] i need oil in this lamp because when the
[1:17:21] bridegroom cometh
[1:17:22] i want to be able to rise up and meet
[1:17:24] him and go inside that door
[1:17:26] into the marriage supper and it close
[1:17:28] behind me and no it's
[1:17:30] all over it's all done we're talking in
[1:17:31] the office of just that
[1:17:33] what just seeing one of those
[1:17:35] resurrected saints i tell you that'll
[1:17:36] change everything
[1:17:37] you want to have oil at that time
[1:17:39] because i can assure you
[1:17:40] if you don't got oil by that time you've
[1:17:42] got a problem
[1:17:44] you want to make sure your lamp is
[1:17:46] trimmed and ready
[1:17:47] and burning but our brown says god raise
[1:17:50] up some preachers that'll go to trim and
[1:17:52] lamps
[1:17:53] i said lord i'll do that tonight i'll go
[1:17:56] out there and preach
[1:17:57] get ready warning and judgment but there
[1:18:00] is a place
[1:18:01] that you can prepare there's been a plan

[1:18:07] oncoming judgment
[1:18:15] i urge you tonight here
[1:18:20] there what are you preparing for
[1:18:24] as i asked

[1:18:31] i'm preparing to live i'm preparing to
[1:18:34] live this whole world is not my home
[1:18:36] i'm just passing through my treasures
[1:18:38] are laid up
[1:18:39] somewhere beyond the blue they're all
[1:18:41] expecting me
[1:18:43] on heaven's open door sure because i
[1:18:46] can't
[1:18:47] feel at home in this world anymore i'll
[1:18:49] tell you
[1:18:50] you better not be feeling at home here
[1:18:52] because it is disaster
[1:18:54] disaster people are going insane just in
[1:18:58] our own little town
[1:18:59] train trains are wrecking and fires are
[1:19:00] burning and whatever else that happened
[1:19:03] pandemics happening
[1:19:04] something else happened on on monday
[1:19:06] that was catastrophic oh cable getting

[1:19:38] time and then you're like oh my goodness
[1:19:39] i got not enough time
[1:19:41] how things change well you know i just
[1:19:44] want to come to the end
[1:19:45] just a little bit at close here because
[1:19:46] we can talk a lot about the warning and
[1:19:49] the preparing and
[1:19:50] the the negative side of it or not i
[1:19:52] shouldn't say negative but the sobering
[1:19:54] side of it
[1:19:54] it is sobering because we're striving to
[1:19:57] ensure that you
[1:19:58] all make it we want to make sure that
[1:20:00] everybody because it's free
[1:20:01] it's god's but he didn't it's like well
[1:20:03] you know not for you but for you no no

[1:20:06] god would that all would repent that's
[1:20:09] scripture
[1:20:12] but with preparation with preparation
[1:20:16] comes great peace
[1:20:20] preparation brings peace and i just want
[1:20:22] to just
[1:20:23] just touch on that touch on that just a
[1:20:25] little bit here
[1:20:26] because when all is ready and it don't
[1:20:30] matter
[1:20:31] it don't matter how crazy it is you can
[1:20:33] just
[1:20:34] rest because you've come into peace the
[1:20:36] storm could rage
[1:20:37] your anchor set and it's just
[1:20:41] i'm good he's in my life
[1:20:44] my oh my lamp is filled and i'm just
[1:20:47] i'm just going to coast those waves and
[1:20:49] man scripture says now i want to
[1:20:51] talk to this this is actually let's read
[1:20:53] ephesians 6 14
[1:20:55] stand therefore
[1:20:59] we're talking about battle now ephesians
[1:21:01] 6 armor
[1:21:03] stand therefore having your loins gird
[1:21:04] about you with truth having the
[1:21:05] breastplate of righteousness
[1:21:07] and your feet shod with the preparation
[1:21:13] the readiness the preparedness
[1:21:17] of the gospel of peace this is part of
[1:21:20] your armor
[1:21:21] it's part of your armor your feet are
[1:21:24] shod
[1:21:26] you know i would hate to walk around
[1:21:27] without no shoes
[1:21:29] uh i'm a shoe guy in fact i'm a sock guy
[1:21:32] i hate bare feet hate it with passion i
[1:21:35] i can absolutely relate with this
[1:21:37] scripture 100
[1:21:39] because little i did detest walking in
[1:21:41] bare feet
[1:21:42] i can't imagine battling in bare feet
[1:21:46] imagine your feet would just be a lump
[1:21:49] of mush
[1:21:50] because it had been stepped on and rocks
[1:21:52] and this and that and
[1:21:53] and poked and brambles and slip and
[1:21:55] slide in mud i was thinking about this
[1:21:57] i was thinking of brother dave we were
[1:21:59] fishing and he was in some certain boots
[1:22:01] and we were in mud and oh my goodness he
[1:22:03] was it was like he was skiing
[1:22:04] through the mud because his shoes
[1:22:06] weren't fit for the terrain it was quite
[1:22:08] comical but nonetheless
[1:22:10] your feet are shod with the preparation
[1:22:14] of the gospel of peace
[1:22:20] shod preparation because when you have
[1:22:24] your feet
[1:22:25] your feet actually when they were in
[1:22:26] battle then they had their little
[1:22:28] sandals whatever they actually had
[1:22:29] little
[1:22:29] little studs and stuff on the bottom so
[1:22:31] that you could be there
[1:22:32] you're ready you weren't all over and
[1:22:35] someone comes to battle you
[1:22:36] no you actually had these little studs
[1:22:38] in your in their shoes so that you were
[1:22:39] ready
[1:22:40] you were prepared if satan came this way
[1:22:43] or this way you could move
[1:22:44] if he's here you can move you're not
[1:22:46] slipping all over and down and gone
[1:22:48] or maybe he's like i got no shoes i
[1:22:49] don't want to move and so you're stuck
[1:22:51] in place no your feet were shod
[1:22:53] with the preparation so you could be
[1:22:54] ready for the onslaught of the enemy
[1:22:56] no shoes you're toast
[1:23:00] it's not you can have your sword in
[1:23:01] shield and all that you're going to wage
[1:23:02] battle for a little while but if you
[1:23:03] don't got complete armor
[1:23:04] and god put into scripture your feet
[1:23:06] have something on them
[1:23:09] he actually shot it with the preparation
[1:23:12] of the gospel of peace
[1:23:13] it's to be prepared having your feet
[1:23:15] shot the gospel
[1:23:17] is the peace with god that comes through
[1:23:19] being reconciled
[1:23:21] to him through jesus christ
[1:23:24] that's what you're prepared with you're
[1:23:26] like i'm ready i'm planted i'm anchored
[1:23:28] you know exactly which way the devil's
[1:23:30] coming and so therefore
[1:23:32] you're content and at rest because
[1:23:35] christ lives rules and reigns and i i'm
[1:23:38] anchored in him
[1:23:39] and each win no matter which way he
[1:23:41] comes that's what's grounding me
[1:23:43] is my feet are ready and prepared with
[1:23:46] the gospel
[1:23:47] of peace and then it's just
[1:23:51] rest little bride fight away
[1:23:55] all you want devil but i'm ready i've
[1:23:57] got i've got my weapons
[1:23:58] but don't don't disregard the fact that
[1:24:01] your feet
[1:24:02] actually give you peace in the battle
[1:24:06] because that's what you're shot with
[1:24:09] peace
[1:24:10] you're prepared he gave that for your
[1:24:14] preparation
[1:24:17] it's a peace that passes all
[1:24:18] understanding because in him
[1:24:21] because you're in him and you look
[1:24:23] around you like i said you have those
[1:24:24] they're not
[1:24:25] they don't have christ their hearts are
[1:24:27] failing for fear as scripture says
[1:24:29] but you when you're shod with that when
[1:24:32] christ is in you
[1:24:33] and you've accepted his propitiation you
[1:24:36] should be at complete peace
[1:24:38] and rest in this time you're prepared
[1:24:42] you're prepared
[1:24:45] you're anchored in jesus amen
[1:24:49] in the cleft of the rock

[1:26:54] in the name of jesus
[1:26:55] christ for water baptism i walk right in

[1:40:13] in the services and see her responding
[1:40:15] to the lord jesus

[1:41:01] friday to know that
[1:41:03] sister abigail's desiring baptism isn't
[1:41:05] this wonderful
[1:41:07] tonight when i was thinking of sister
[1:41:10] abigail
[1:41:11] about your baptism tonight
[1:41:15] 3rd john chapter 1 verse 4 says i have
[1:41:19] no greater joy than to hear that my
[1:41:21] children walk in truth and the very name
[1:41:25] of abigail means
[1:41:27] the father's joy and brother alex was
[1:41:30] just
[1:41:31] giving us a testimony when uh sister
[1:41:34] walkina was expecting sister abigail the
[1:41:37] ultrasound they were putting the
[1:41:38] ultrasound
[1:41:40] on sister walkina and the baby was just
[1:41:42] jumping and
[1:41:43] so happy there and there was something
[1:41:45] in brother alex and sister joaquin's
[1:41:47] heart
[1:41:48] this child is going to be one of joy and
[1:41:51] to know that
[1:41:52] john said in the bible i have no greater
[1:41:55] joy
[1:41:55] than to hear that my children walk in
[1:41:58] truth
[1:41:59] it's not just an event tonight that's
[1:42:01] just on a wednesday night it's the holy
[1:42:03] spirit
[1:42:04] that is blessing sister abigail and her
[1:42:06] family
[1:42:07] for all these years and to see that her
[1:42:10] walking
[1:42:11] in truth now sister abigail i went back
[1:42:14] to the old testament
[1:42:15] first samuel chapter 25 to the abigail
[1:42:19] in the scripture the bible says abigail
[1:42:22] was a woman of good understanding and of
[1:42:24] beautiful
[1:42:25] countenance and abigail acted in a good
[1:42:29] character
[1:42:31] even though she was married to a husband
[1:42:33] a neighbor
[1:42:34] who he was cheerless in his nature he
[1:42:37] was evil and hard and
[1:42:39] cruel she was married to a husband that
[1:42:42] was
[1:42:42] difficult and intense and stubborn and
[1:42:45] stiff-necked
[1:42:47] but abigail had good understanding
[1:42:50] she had good prudence she had insight
[1:42:54] this is the character of abigail
[1:42:56] in the scripture she had good sense and
[1:42:58] wise
[1:42:59] and gave attention to give peace she was
[1:43:03] always one of harmony and did not want
[1:43:06] to cause
[1:43:06] trouble but when mabel died
[1:43:09] immediately david took abigail to be his
[1:43:13] wife
[1:43:14] because of her good character and
[1:43:17] i just want you to notice this because
[1:43:19] it has to do with the time we're living
[1:43:21] in now
[1:43:23] that she became david's wife in a season
[1:43:26] of time that was very difficult
[1:43:28] some would say it was a bad time for
[1:43:31] david because he was extreme
[1:43:33] experiencing a difficult struggle he was
[1:43:36] like being a refugee like a fugitive he
[1:43:38] was wondering
[1:43:40] uh throughout a wilderness time of his
[1:43:42] life
[1:43:43] and so bringing it to now tonight for
[1:43:46] abigail
[1:43:47] in the scripture abigail's presence and
[1:43:50] her testimony in her life which is what
[1:43:52] we heard about
[1:43:53] tonight in the scripture abigail brought
[1:43:56] pleasure
[1:43:57] and joy and satisfaction
[1:44:00] before david even got to the throne
[1:44:03] abigail was someone that brought joy to
[1:44:06] david's heart
[1:44:08] and even in his desert experience the
[1:44:11] only thing
[1:44:12] david had to offer abigail was a promise
[1:44:16] and an anointing that one day one day
[1:44:19] it's all going to be different we're
[1:44:21] going to sit on the throne
[1:44:24] and right up till today 2020 today
[1:44:27] this abigail has received the promise of
[1:44:30] god
[1:44:31] and she's been born under the anointing
[1:44:34] of this message
[1:44:35] she's been called to bring joy to the
[1:44:38] soon-coming king
[1:44:40] in this difficult time and even in the
[1:44:44] time of global pandemic when
[1:44:46] the holy spirit seems to be like a
[1:44:48] fugitive in the world it's very scarce
[1:44:51] he's coming to his throne this is when
[1:44:53] this abigail
[1:44:55] is going to bring joy to the heart of
[1:44:57] god
[1:44:59] we are literally seeing a miracle
[1:45:01] tonight of a young lady
[1:45:02] that has a desire for god and last
[1:45:06] wednesday night
[1:45:07] when sister abigail i don't know if you
[1:45:09] saw it sister joanne
[1:45:10] all alone walked to this altar she
[1:45:13] didn't need the crowd she'd move beyond
[1:45:17] just the mother
[1:45:18] just be on the school teacher just
[1:45:20] beyond the father
[1:45:22] just beyond just ministry all being
[1:45:24] around and
[1:45:26] she came alone that was her moment
[1:45:29] when great joy bursted out in heaven
[1:45:32] and may tonight's service
[1:45:36] be a smile of approval even for our
[1:45:38] assembly
[1:45:39] the in the time of fugitive and it seems
[1:45:42] like david is on his way to the throne
[1:45:44] here in abigail the joy the joy of the
[1:45:48] father
[1:45:49] is being joined to jesus christ isn't
[1:45:52] that a wonderful thing
[1:45:54] as we pray with her tonight may this
[1:45:56] abigail's life bring pleasure
[1:45:59] and bring fulfillment to christ
[1:46:02] on the way to his throne
