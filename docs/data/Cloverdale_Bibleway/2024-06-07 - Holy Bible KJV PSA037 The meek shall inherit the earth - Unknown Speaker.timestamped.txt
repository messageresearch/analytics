[0:00] Psalm 37 a Psalm of David fret not
[0:04] thyself because of evildoers neither be
[0:06] thou envious against the workers of
[0:08] iniquity for they shall soon be cut down
[0:11] like the grass and wither as the green
[0:13] herb trust in the Lord and do good so
[0:16] shalt thou dwell in the land and verily
[0:19] Thou shalt be fed Delight thyself also
[0:22] in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the
[0:24] desires of thine heart commit thy way
[0:27] unto the Lord trust also in him and he
[0:30] shall bring it to pass and he shall
[0:31] bring forth thy righteousness as light
[0:34] and thy judgment as the noon day rest in
[0:37] the Lord and wait patiently for him fret
[0:40] not thyself because of him who
[0:41] prospereth in his way because of the man
[0:44] who bringeth Wicked devices to pass
[0:46] cease from anger and forsake wrath fret
[0:49] not thyself in any wise to do evil for
[0:52] evildoers shall be cut off but those
[0:55] that wait upon the Lord they shall
[0:57] inherit the earth for yet a little while
[1:00] and the wicked shall not be yay Thou
[1:02] shalt diligently consider his place and
[1:05] it shall not be but the meek shall
[1:07] inherit the earth and shall Delight
[1:10] themselves in the abundance of peace
