[18:47] to go out and how to be pleasing in your
[18:49] sight. Lord, we worship you this
[18:51] morning.

[31:37] tr
[31:42] [Music]
[31:49] in the presence
[31:55] of the king.
[31:59] I'd like to say before we sing it again,
[32:01] troubles do vanish. Just depending what
[32:04] you're expecting and hearts are mended.
[32:07] Are you expecting it as you prepare
[32:11] yourself for the word and for what God
[32:14] has for us in the service? Let's believe
[32:16] for that.
[32:18] Listening to a message.
[32:21] Yet this morning coming even to the
[32:23] service,
[32:26] I never I don't believe I've ever heard
[32:29] brother Brandham so clearly just teach
[32:33] the whole ministry and manifestation of
[32:36] the son of man. And the reason he did
[32:39] was because he was in Los Angeles. It
[32:41] was 1965. and he was
[32:45] speaking to the people and had called
[32:47] those that had prayer cards, called the
[32:50] first 20.
[32:52] And they were standing there lined up.
[32:54] And then he asked the the congregation,
[32:56] all the people that were there, the
[32:58] audience, how many have been in his
[33:01] meetings?
[33:03] And then he asked, "How many have never
[33:05] been in a meeting?"
[33:07] And the microphone just goes dead
[33:09] silent.
[33:11] Why? You can hear him kind of
[33:14] questioning.
[33:15] Did I Is this right?
[33:20] And he said, "Let me say that again. How
[33:23] many have never been in one of my
[33:25] meetings?"
[33:27] When the hands went up, he was just in
[33:31] he was stunned.
[33:33] And then even while the people were
[33:35] standing, he went into a teaching
[33:38] discourse and took the manifestation
[33:42] of this God in the son of man ministry
[33:45] and took it from Genesis all through the
[33:48] scripture. It was so clear. It is I
[33:51] believe the message does God ever change
[33:53] his mind of his word? The one in Los
[33:57] Angeles January 1965.
[34:00] If you ever have anybody you're wanting
[34:02] to introduce that ministry, that was an
[34:05] incredible message and then began to
[34:09] reveal the secrets of the hearts called
[34:11] the first person up and began to reveal
[34:14] the secrets of the hearts. Well, the
[34:17] people were so still, the ministry is so
[34:19] still, but when that manifestation when
[34:21] it begin to bring God on the scene, but
[34:24] he said that is proving that what I told
[34:26] you is true.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. and they were receiving it and
[34:29] receiving I would say receiving the the
[34:33] witness of it. But the thing was then he
[34:36] tried to convey to the people that same
[34:38] God is present right here in the
[34:41] ministers and you that have needs. And
[34:44] the same God that raised Jesus and
[34:47] brought him out of the tomb is right
[34:49] here in this service. And that is where
[34:51] people fail. He just can't bridge that
[34:54] and couldn't get them to grasp that. And
[34:57] that is that is our big problem. That's
[35:00] exactly where we are. If we could
[35:01] believe and be consumed with faith that
[35:04] that same God is present right here to
[35:08] do everything that he did in the
[35:09] prophets ministry and the apostles
[35:11] ministry in the ministry of Jesus
[35:13] Christ. If you could believe that and we
[35:15] could have one thought throughout this
[35:17] entire congregation, if you could just
[35:20] come to grips with your thoughts, bring
[35:22] them into captivity and have that simple
[35:25] faith, there wouldn't be anything
[35:27] impossible.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; And I believe what he said, there
[35:30] wouldn't be a sick person in the
[35:32] building in the next 5 minutes.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; I believe that. Do you believe that?
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I can truly say troubles
[35:40] vanish
[35:42] &gt;&gt; and hearts are mended.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; You got a problem, you got a weight on
[35:47] you this morning. Watch it vanish in the
[35:50] presence of Jehovah.
[35:54] in the presence
[36:01] of Jehovah
[36:07] God Almighty.
[36:12] Praise
[36:14] our peace.
[36:16] Bring peace, dear Lord.
[36:19] Trouble.
[36:22] Oh yes they do.
[36:25] Hearts are mened
[36:31] in the preious
[36:34] [Music]
[36:37] of the king.
[36:41] [Music]
[36:43] How wonderful.
[36:45] I'm excited.
[36:47] Hallelujah.
[36:50] You heard the announcement that there's
[36:52] no Wednesday service. It'll be on
[36:54] Friday. That is a special service that
[36:56] we're going to be doing a video
[37:00] and brother John Stall will be
[37:03] uh he will be speaking of his testimony
[37:08] and uh other things. It's going to be a
[37:12] I think a very wonderful evening. But
[37:15] tonight after the service here, after
[37:19] the service, immediately following the
[37:21] service, we'd like all the people that
[37:23] are formerly from the colonies, if you
[37:26] would meet, please in the chapel, and
[37:29] brother Jeremy Waldner is going to uh
[37:32] assist. We want to have a song. It's a
[37:35] well-known song to all of you from the
[37:37] colonies. And we want to have you go
[37:40] over the song a time or two because it's
[37:43] going to be an important part also of
[37:45] the video. So that's immediately
[37:47] following the service tonight.
[37:50] Uh I had a good question brother Jeremy
[37:52] raised and that is what about people
[37:54] like me? He said you know my parents
[37:57] came from the colony but I was born
[37:59] afterward. I said, "Oh, yes,
[38:01] definitely." That is even a more
[38:04] powerful testimony because
[38:08] a lot of people that have been remained
[38:09] on the colonies, they realize that what
[38:12] they have is not the answer. But they
[38:16] see those that have become disenchanted
[38:18] and have left and saw their children and
[38:22] their youth go the way of the world and
[38:25] go into sin. and they've said, "Well, we
[38:28] we don't really want what we don't have
[38:30] faith in what we have, and we certainly
[38:32] don't have faith in what has happened to
[38:35] those that have left." We have a
[38:37] testimony here that we've not conveyed
[38:40] sufficiently to the people. And I want
[38:44] you that are going to participate to
[38:46] recognize that this will be a grand
[38:49] opportunity
[38:51] to and it won't go just for a week. It
[38:54] will go for whatever time God gives us
[38:57] in the future as a testimony and a
[39:00] testament to this message of what it can
[39:03] do and what it has done and what it is
[39:05] doing. Can you say amen?
[39:07] &gt;&gt; It's going to be powerful. So, right
[39:09] after the service this evening. All
[39:12] right. Thank you for remaining standing
[39:14] and that's all we'll have in the way of
[39:16] song. I'll have you turn in your Bibles
[39:18] please to Matthew
[39:20] the 11th chapter
[39:23] and we're going to read verses 25- 27
[39:28] and then I will be reading from Luke the
[39:31] 10th chapter which is a essentially the
[39:35] same account starting at verse 22.
[39:41] Just before we read, I'd like to have
[39:44] prayer with you. Let's pray together.
[39:49] Dear Father,
[39:51] this morning we are in awe
[39:55] at what you've done. We feel so humbled
[39:59] and small
[40:01] and insignificant
[40:03] when we think that the God that created
[40:05] all things,
[40:07] the God who came and met and made
[40:10] promise to Abraham
[40:13] and the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob
[40:16] and of Moses and the prophets
[40:19] would come and be here with us today.
[40:24] I pray that you'll manifest yourself.
[40:26] You're the God of the messengers, the
[40:28] God of the apostles,
[40:30] the God of the prophet, messenger of
[40:33] this generation. You stood at the
[40:35] platform, Lord. You stood at the
[40:37] platform before tens of thousands and
[40:41] hundreds of thousands of people. And
[40:44] here we are as a congregation and the
[40:46] invisible congregation on the internet.
[40:49] Move into this sanctuary. I pray with an
[40:54] intensified presence. Move into our very
[40:58] being by the Holy Spirit. Remove every
[41:01] obstacle and doubt of unbelief, oh God.
[41:05] Remove every hindrance. Heal the hearts
[41:08] and souls and minds of the people, oh
[41:12] God. And I pray that Satan will lie
[41:15] defeated. I pray, Father, that the
[41:18] saints of God will be able to place
[41:20] their foot upon his neck and know that
[41:24] he lies defeated before them. For we
[41:27] have a God that has never lost a battle.
[41:30] Father, today reveal your word and make
[41:33] it known to us, I pray. And may Lord,
[41:36] while it may be my voice of this human
[41:39] body, but may it be the very very
[41:43] thoughts of God that are being
[41:44] expressed, bring it to the people, I
[41:47] pray, anoint by the Holy Spirit to speak
[41:50] and to also hear in Jesus Christ's name
[41:53] we ask it. Amen.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Matthew 11 and 25.
[42:00] At that time Jesus answered and said, I
[42:04] thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and
[42:07] earth, because thou hast hid these
[42:10] things from the wise and prudent, and
[42:12] hast revealed them unto babes. Even so,
[42:16] Father, for so it seemed good in thy
[42:19] sight. All things are delivered unto me
[42:22] of my Father, and no man knoweth the
[42:25] Son, but the Father, neither knoweth any
[42:29] man the Father, save the Son, and he to
[42:33] whomsoever the Son will reveal him. I'd
[42:38] like you to notice that last line. And
[42:40] he to whomsoever the Son will reveal
[42:44] him. In Luke 10
[42:47] verse 22,
[42:49] all things are delivered to me of my
[42:51] father. And no man knoweth the son, who
[42:55] the son is, but the father, and who the
[42:58] father is, but the son, and he to whom
[43:01] the son will reveal him. And he turned
[43:04] him unto his disciples, and said
[43:06] privately,
[43:08] blessed are the eyes which see the
[43:12] things that you see. For I tell you that
[43:15] many prophets and kings have desired to
[43:18] see those things which you see and have
[43:21] not seen them and to hear the things
[43:24] which you hear and have not heard them.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:32] The apostle Paul said in Ephesians
[43:35] which we know so well 4 and30 and grieve
[43:38] not the spirit of God the Holy Spirit of
[43:41] God whereby ye are sealed unto the day
[43:46] of your redemption. God bless you as you
[43:49] have your seats.
[43:56] I'd like to draw your attention to a
[43:59] subject this morning
[44:02] and you'll need your full attention and
[44:06] focus on the
[44:08] word. I want to speak on security
[44:13] in silence.
[44:16] This is a age of mass media
[44:21] and the passing and transfer of words is
[44:25] happening
[44:27] just in a way that the world has never
[44:31] known
[44:34] by way of telephone and by way of radio
[44:37] and by way of texting and by way of uh
[44:40] the internet and by way of television
[44:43] and on and on and on and And the
[44:46] transmission of news is instantaneous
[44:50] from around the globe in just seconds.
[44:53] It is from the time it's happened to the
[44:55] time you've heard it is just a instant
[44:58] away which we can say in one way it's
[45:01] that's really remarkable and my it has
[45:04] made uh it has made business so much
[45:08] more effective and we can be so much
[45:10] more efficient and there's a lot of
[45:13] things we can probably say very good
[45:15] about it on the other hand I think it
[45:19] tends to enslave people also it is made
[45:22] us slaves to our telephones and slaves
[45:26] to our gadgets. And finally, the gadgets
[45:29] begin to dictate what we do and with our
[45:31] time and so on and so forth. And so we
[45:34] can find that there's good and evil
[45:36] always in the tree of knowledge, right?
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Is it not so?
[45:44] &gt;&gt; But there is something that's sublime
[45:46] about silence.
[45:49] And there's time when silence is
[45:53] not merely
[45:55] necessary,
[45:56] but there's time when silence actually
[46:01] is a protection.
[46:04] And I'm going to go through the
[46:06] scriptures
[46:08] and
[46:09] hopefully show you that God has used
[46:14] silence very effectively.
[46:18] In fact is I would say that silence has
[46:22] been God's secret weapon.
[46:25] He's been silent. He's kept things. When
[46:28] things have been veiled, that's exactly
[46:31] what it is. When it's veiled,
[46:33] people, they don't know what it is. And
[46:37] he can even unveil it and it can be
[46:40] exposed into full view, but the people
[46:44] still don't know what it is. And so the
[46:47] secret weapon is revelation.
[46:52] And that word has been so misunderstood,
[46:58] so misused and abused.
[47:02] And they've tagged revelation onto all
[47:05] kinds of things. Somebody has some wonky
[47:08] idea. They say, "Oh, it's a revelation."
[47:11] Oh, well, it's not one I want.
[47:17] Oh, you can't quite see it. You can't
[47:19] quite understand. Well, you need a
[47:20] revelation. That may be true. But that
[47:24] man is only I think a lot of people, a
[47:28] lot of religious movements, a lot of men
[47:32] who have ideas, a lot of preachers,
[47:35] they've used the word and actually
[47:37] borrowed it. But it's God's word. It's a
[47:41] it's a word that God has reserved to
[47:44] himself. And I want to make a lot of
[47:46] statements on revelation today.
[47:50] And you may be asking yourself, and
[47:52] don't ask yourself a lot of questions
[47:54] before the service is over because
[47:56] people may say, "Well, how can I have
[47:58] it? How can I get it really? What is
[48:01] it?" And those are some of the questions
[48:04] the Lord willing I want to try to
[48:06] answer.
[48:08] security
[48:10] when I read the last scripture, grieve
[48:12] not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby
[48:15] you're sealed unto the day of your
[48:17] redemption. And brother Brandham deals a
[48:19] great deal with the seal because he was
[48:22] the instrument that God would use to
[48:24] speak the opening of the seven seals.
[48:28] And we might say, well, some might say
[48:29] right away, well, the seventh seal
[48:31] wasn't open. and he said it wasn't open,
[48:33] but he read the scripture which we'll
[48:35] read later on and I don't want to get
[48:36] into it now because I'm way ahead on on
[48:38] on where I'm wanting to go. But uh the
[48:42] seventh seal is and the seventh seal was
[48:44] opened. It says and there was silence in
[48:47] heaven silence in heaven for about the
[48:50] space for the spa for about the space of
[48:52] half an hour. Well, that is just so
[48:55] mysterious.
[48:57] But brother Brandham did say and and to
[49:00] me it opened the seal said it's the
[49:03] coming of the Lord
[49:04] &gt;&gt; and that's why it was silent. And that
[49:07] word silence is only used twice in the
[49:10] entire New Testament. Once when apostle
[49:13] Paul was brought before that whole
[49:16] raging crowd and the Bible says and and
[49:19] and the people were stilled or brought
[49:23] to made quiet be quiet and there was a
[49:25] great silence. That was one time it was
[49:28] used. And the second time it's used is
[49:31] in in Revelation 8 and1 and there was a
[49:35] and the seventh seal was opened and
[49:38] there was silence
[49:42] and Jesus when he spoke of his coming he
[49:45] said no man would know
[49:49] &gt;&gt; not the angels
[49:51] &gt;&gt; and not even the son but God himself.
[49:55] God has used silence as a great great
[50:00] tool and I'll say a great weapon and the
[50:03] only the only thing that we the only
[50:07] tool that is used is the channel of
[50:12] revelation and that is why brother
[50:14] Brandham has said that revelation is
[50:17] more important to you than you will ever
[50:20] realize I'm talking about a revelation
[50:24] from God.
[50:26] In the unveiling of God, now we're
[50:28] talking about security.
[50:34] In the unveiling of God, he said God is
[50:38] a spirit and Jesus is the body that he
[50:41] was veiled in.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; I want you to get the connection between
[50:48] the veiling. When God veiled something,
[50:50] it was hidden.
[50:52] When God veiled something,
[50:55] it was I it's associated with silence
[50:59] because there was nothing to discuss.
[51:01] There was nothing to talk about. There
[51:03] was nothing to be discovered because it
[51:05] was veiled.
[51:07] When it's uncovered, then a person may
[51:10] say, "Oh, oh, isn't that marvelous? Oh,
[51:12] isn't that wonderful? Oh, isn't that a
[51:13] great piece of architecture? Isn't that
[51:15] a isn't that a great model of a
[51:17] automobile that's been designed?"
[51:19] because now it's been uncovered.
[51:21] But even though it's been uncovered, it
[51:23] doesn't mean that a person really
[51:24] understands
[51:26] or has an understanding about what has
[51:28] been uncovered.
[51:30] The Lord Jesus Christ has actually been
[51:32] unveiled in this generation. But how
[51:35] many actually understand it? That's
[51:37] where revelation has to come in. And the
[51:39] revelation is sovereign. The revelation
[51:41] is held at something that's divinely
[51:45] kept by God. And he gives it. He gives
[51:48] it as he sees fit to those who he
[51:51] chooses.
[51:53] And that revelation
[51:56] really is where
[51:58] the entire body of people where where
[52:01] the dividing line comes.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; He was veiled in his prophets.
[52:10] The reason he was veiled in his prophets
[52:11] was because
[52:14] they spoke God's word. And he said they
[52:17] were the flesh that God was veiled in.
[52:19] Can you imagine? And then Jesus came who
[52:22] was God Emmanuel, God in flesh,
[52:28] the fullness of the Godhead bodily in
[52:30] flesh. And he tells them, "You killed
[52:33] all the prophets.
[52:36] You slew your father slew them. You're
[52:38] the children of them that slew the
[52:40] prophets."
[52:42] They didn't want to hear that because
[52:44] they had shined the prophets all up and
[52:46] made them to be nice, good people.
[52:53] God veiled in Jesus to do the work of
[52:56] redemption. Brother Brandham says veiled
[52:58] in Jesus to do the work work of
[53:01] redemption at the cross.
[53:04] And then in in the unveiling of God also
[53:07] just this next statement. Now he said,
[53:09] "Now it isn't a written word to us. It's
[53:12] a reality. It's not just a written word.
[53:15] How many people hold the Bible today?
[53:17] It's not just a written word to us. It's
[53:20] a reality. We are in him and now we're
[53:24] enjoying him. Now we behold him. Now we
[53:29] see him. The word manifesting himself.
[53:33] It's hid out there because why? It's
[53:37] veiled in human flesh. That's why it's
[53:40] hid. It's veiled in human flesh. But
[53:42] even though even though the people could
[53:45] hear the word of God, listen, when Jesus
[53:48] Christ was on Calvary,
[53:51] the prophet said that the the mercy seat
[53:55] was exposed to full view.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; There isn't a record of anyone in this
[54:04] book that saw that.
[54:08] There isn't a record of one single
[54:10] person saying, "I got a revelation. The
[54:14] mercy seat is hanging on full view at
[54:18] Calvary,
[54:20] even though it was exposed." He said
[54:22] exposed
[54:24] to the eye and the vision of the people
[54:27] and the vessel that was there. Jesus
[54:30] Christ himself in the mercy seat was
[54:33] exposed to full view. But no one, not
[54:38] one, had a revelation
[54:41] that the mercy seat was hanging there in
[54:43] full view.
[54:47] It gets squeaky.
[54:49] It gets squeaky. But I need to make it
[54:52] very very
[54:54] uh pronounced
[54:58] if security.
[55:03] Now
[55:05] perhaps you're not getting the
[55:06] connection between the silence and the
[55:08] security.
[55:10] When I just spoke of Jesus and the mercy
[55:13] seat was in full view,
[55:16] only only by a revelation
[55:20] could a person ever come to the
[55:22] knowledge that that was the mercy seat.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Bren talks about a mark on a
[55:31] person. We're still talking about a
[55:33] seal. A mark on a person or a thing. A
[55:36] mark is a is also a security.
[55:39] So I I just go back. Jesus is on Calvary
[55:43] and the mercy seat's in full view, but
[55:46] it has not been revealed. So what is it?
[55:48] He sealed it. It's still sealed. And the
[55:52] seal is a security. He's protecting it.
[55:55] I'll give you I'll give you just a a
[55:57] statement that the prophet made and then
[55:59] it'll it'll I want that to kind of over
[56:02] uh be an overriding thought throughout
[56:04] the service. He said concerning the
[56:07] seventh seal, he said Jesus said nothing
[56:10] about it. He came right up through the
[56:12] six in Matthew 24 and then when it came
[56:15] to the seventh, he just went on to
[56:18] parables. He said nothing about it. He
[56:20] said God kept it God kept it a secret.
[56:25] For if it had gotten out, the devil
[56:28] could have done a lot of damage with it.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; So God was protecting the truth. God
[56:35] protects his truth until the person or
[56:40] the individuals who are ordained to see
[56:43] it arrive on the scene and then God
[56:47] reveals it to them divinely by a
[56:50] personal revelation. Now a revelation
[56:54] cannot be taught to you.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; A revelation cannot be reasoned out to
[57:00] you. A revelation is not the result of
[57:04] someone winning an argument.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; And once a person has a revelation, it
[57:12] can never be taken away from them.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Once a person has it revealed to them, I
[57:20] will say they can never fall away from
[57:24] it. Oh, they might get discouraged and a
[57:26] person may even, you know, become cool
[57:29] or become indifferent or drift away from
[57:32] it. But they will always can never shake
[57:35] the reality what God revealed to them.
[57:39] You'll never get away from it. No matter
[57:42] even if you wandered and drifted and and
[57:44] disobeyed God and whatever more, but
[57:47] you'll never get away from a revelation
[57:51] when it comes. It it can be the simplest
[57:53] thing. And on my knees today, I said in
[57:57] simplicity,
[57:59] God,
[58:01] I need a revelation, too. I need more
[58:04] revelation. But one thing is certain. I
[58:08] know that was you speaking through that
[58:11] messenger. That was you revealing the
[58:14] secrets of the heart. That was none
[58:17] other than God Almighty, creator of
[58:20] heavens and earth that came on the scene
[58:23] in this generation. And if I can't say
[58:25] anything else in life, if I can't make
[58:27] any other declaration, I want to be able
[58:30] to say I'm identified with that.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; I may not know a lot of things. I may
[58:38] not be able to make a lot of great
[58:39] statements, but I would like to be able
[58:41] to declare today before this audience, I
[58:44] believe that was God himself
[58:48] &gt;&gt; veiled in flesh
[58:50] &gt;&gt; making himself known to the people. And
[58:53] I don't want to be misunderstood, but I
[58:54] want you to hear very clearly that God
[58:57] did something in this generation he has
[59:00] not done in any age, even since the
[59:03] since the Bible times.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that with me?
[59:10] Apostle Paul has said,
[59:13] "Now to him that is of power to
[59:16] establish
[59:18] to establish you according according to
[59:21] my gospel and the preaching and the
[59:24] preaching of Jesus Christ according to
[59:26] the revelation of the mystery." I'll
[59:28] come to that in a few minutes. Which was
[59:30] kept secret since the world began.
[59:35] kept secret since the world began. And
[59:38] then he says that it is made known by
[59:41] the preaching of the gospel that came
[59:44] through him. He knew and he was not
[59:47] apologetic about it. It has been kept
[59:50] secret. What did God do? He protected
[59:53] it. He veiled it. He sealed it. All of
[59:57] those words are related to the subject.
[1:00:00] It can only come. All right? He sealed
[1:00:02] it. He He hid it. He kept it secret. So
[1:00:07] what's the answer to this? Only by
[1:00:10] revelation of that mystery. And they can
[1:00:13] call it a mystery, but God only by
[1:00:16] revelation of this mystery. And when
[1:00:19] it's revealed, the mystery of the
[1:00:22] scripture, the mystery of the event,
[1:00:25] when it's revealed to the individual,
[1:00:27] that is the process. And the word
[1:00:29] mystery in the Greek actually means
[1:00:32] those that are initiated into a special
[1:00:36] group. It is that revealing of that
[1:00:39] revelation by revelation of the mystery
[1:00:42] that God has held secret that is the
[1:00:45] process of initiation. all kinds of
[1:00:47] groups maybe the lodges and and the
[1:00:50] universities and colleges and whatever
[1:00:52] more they have some uh initiation rights
[1:00:56] you know you have to go through a
[1:00:58] process of initiation and then you're in
[1:01:00] the club then you're in the group then
[1:01:02] you're one of us by the initiation if
[1:01:05] you don't go through that initiation
[1:01:07] some have even lost their lives in init
[1:01:10] going through some kind of initiation
[1:01:13] process and they and there's been
[1:01:15] inquiries into Well, this is initiation.
[1:01:18] Initiation into the bride of Jesus
[1:01:21] Christ is by God revealing the mystery
[1:01:25] of his word to you. And once that's
[1:01:28] revealed, you can never shake that.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; A seal, you become sealed by the Holy
[1:01:41] Spirit. And a seal is security.
[1:01:45] A seal
[1:01:47] also signifies
[1:01:49] ownership. God owns you. When you are
[1:01:53] sealed, you're not your own any longer.
[1:01:57] You belong. God puts a seal upon you. He
[1:02:00] re by revelation. He reveals that his
[1:02:04] word is the truth. By revelation, he
[1:02:07] reveals that the message is the message.
[1:02:09] Amen.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; You know, you could have shaken brother
[1:02:13] Brandham's hand. A lot of people did.
[1:02:15] You could have sat down and had dinner
[1:02:17] with him.
[1:02:19] But someday,
[1:02:21] if God so wills, then you have a
[1:02:24] revelation.
[1:02:26] This is a prophet of God.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; This is Malachi 4.
[1:02:31] This is this is
[1:02:35] the Elohim that met Abraham
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; is here again today in a different form
[1:02:43] in a different veil of flesh but to do
[1:02:46] the same thing and he behind his back he
[1:02:50] called a woman and now he turns his back
[1:02:52] as he did here in Los Angeles turn his
[1:02:54] back went right back to that scripture
[1:02:57] made that very scripture work game.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; And if you don't believe it was that
[1:03:02] God, then you do it
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; or you find someone to do it.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; And that's where the rubber hits the
[1:03:14] road.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; And that's why the preachers were so
[1:03:18] silent. Didn't want to agree with what
[1:03:20] he said. But then he would say, "Now I
[1:03:23] will call on the God that I have spoken
[1:03:26] of to come here now and prove what I
[1:03:30] said is the truth."
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; And when the proof came, oh, they were
[1:03:36] so excited about the truth.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; They said, "Now it said, believe the
[1:03:41] doctrine."
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, well, you know, it's not what our
[1:03:44] school taught. Who cares what the school
[1:03:46] teaches?
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Who cares what the theology
[1:03:50] is? Who cares what the denomination is?
[1:03:53] I mean, that's the time I'd let all that
[1:03:55] stuff flee.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; I'd leave it right away. Oh, that wasn't
[1:03:59] what I was taught when I was in Sunday
[1:04:01] school or I was in church or that's not
[1:04:04] what I was taught, you know, 40 years
[1:04:05] ago. Who cares what you were taught 40
[1:04:08] years ago?
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; We want something that works
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; and works now.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; I want something that holds you young
[1:04:17] people and young men. Amen.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; lay it on the line today.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; If you haven't got revelation, Brother
[1:04:25] Brandon says that's something you ought
[1:04:26] to seek.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; And I heard Brother Murphy speak on
[1:04:30] Wednesday evening. If you weren't here,
[1:04:32] I will tell you, get the get the tape or
[1:04:36] get the uh stream it on the archives and
[1:04:39] hear it. Everybody in this congregation
[1:04:41] needs to hear Murphy's service from uh
[1:04:44] on on Wednesday evening. And he spoke on
[1:04:47] surrender, spoke on yielding and spoke
[1:04:50] on the humility that comes when a person
[1:04:53] surrenders. You don't bring anything.
[1:04:55] You come just as you are. You have
[1:04:58] nothing to offer, no thought.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; You have no idea. You just surrender.
[1:05:05] And when you need revelation from God,
[1:05:07] if you're here this morning, and I'm
[1:05:09] sure you are, I'm sure I speak to the
[1:05:12] most of the congregation and you desire,
[1:05:14] some perhaps have never had a revelation
[1:05:17] of this message and you need it. You
[1:05:19] ought to seek that more than you seek a
[1:05:22] job. You should seek that more than you
[1:05:24] seek any material thing. You ought to
[1:05:27] seek that more than you seek anything
[1:05:29] else in life. ought to say, "God, give
[1:05:32] me a revelation of yourself.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Give me revelation of who this messenger
[1:05:41] was.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; I need that revelation." You ought to
[1:05:44] seek that with everything that's in you.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; And that'll be your security.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; We think of security today. And we have
[1:05:56] all kinds of systems.
[1:05:58] A lot of you folks got you got alarms
[1:06:02] for your vehicles.
[1:06:04] Why? Because you don't want it stolen.
[1:06:07] You got alarm for your home.
[1:06:10] We think of security
[1:06:12] devices to protect the things that we
[1:06:15] consider of value.
[1:06:18] We also think of protecting our
[1:06:20] families.
[1:06:22] We want to give them good food
[1:06:25] and protect their well-being.
[1:06:28] mothers and fathers. Anyone who is a
[1:06:30] real mother and father, that's they feel
[1:06:33] that way about their families.
[1:06:35] And it's becoming an increasing concern
[1:06:37] today,
[1:06:43] mothers and fathers both taking their
[1:06:46] children long ways to school and picking
[1:06:50] them up. And many schools, I think most
[1:06:55] put responsibility on the teachers to
[1:06:58] see that those children are handed over
[1:07:00] to their parents
[1:07:02] or the one who's assigned to pick them
[1:07:05] up because there's such concern.
[1:07:09] Isn't it terrible?
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Isn't that a shame?
[1:07:14] modern age that we're in supposed to be
[1:07:16] intelligent age
[1:07:18] and we've come to the place we got to
[1:07:20] watch our children moment by moment
[1:07:23] against some pedophile
[1:07:25] or some animal
[1:07:28] and I think they are
[1:07:31] demon-possessed
[1:07:33] animals
[1:07:34] out after innocent children and it's not
[1:07:37] one here and one there it's become the
[1:07:40] societyy's become infested with that
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; I tell you it shocked me, rocked me to
[1:07:46] my shoes to hear that
[1:07:51] uh a whole network
[1:07:55] of these kind of people not even worthy
[1:07:58] to be spoken of over this pulpit
[1:08:01] in 77 nations including this country of
[1:08:05] Canada tied together and over 2500
[1:08:10] people in a massive of network in child
[1:08:14] pornography.
[1:08:16] I say you forgive me. I don't think
[1:08:19] those per people are worthy of life.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; And God thinks so too cuz he's going to
[1:08:25] destroy them.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, and we cannot
[1:08:32] become lax and say, "Well, you know,
[1:08:35] it's something that happens. I'm not
[1:08:37] going to be on this very long, but I'm
[1:08:38] just going to say it's a terrible thing
[1:08:42] that we have to protect our children to
[1:08:45] such. You know, in my one short
[1:08:46] lifetime,
[1:08:48] I spent about half of my life never
[1:08:50] locked my door of my home. Never locked
[1:08:53] the car. Didn't even think of it.
[1:08:55] Wouldn't even think of locking your car.
[1:08:58] I do it today. I do it here at the
[1:09:01] office. It's just a part of life. You
[1:09:04] lock it up. turn the alarm on all the
[1:09:07] rest of say, "Well, don't you trust
[1:09:09] God?" I sure do, but I don't trust a lot
[1:09:10] of people.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Is it all right if I'm honest?
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; We're familiar with such terms as top
[1:09:24] secret and confidential
[1:09:28] and passwords and ID protection.
[1:09:33] say, "Well, you're spending a lot of
[1:09:34] time on this." Yes. And this I won't
[1:09:36] finish this message this morning. I'm
[1:09:38] just going to go as far as I can go.
[1:09:41] We're very conscious of those things,
[1:09:42] but I have a heavenly father and he also
[1:09:46] has been very conscious of it. He's
[1:09:48] saying, "This is too precious. I'm not
[1:09:50] going to let these people trample this
[1:09:53] underfoot. This is too precious. This is
[1:09:56] too pure. This is too holy. I have
[1:09:59] separated. I have I have identified
[1:10:02] these truths and these are two. Yeah,
[1:10:04] they can take the Bible and they can
[1:10:06] produce them by the millions and it can
[1:10:08] be the it can be the most popular book
[1:10:10] on the face of the earth, but there's
[1:10:12] truths in there and I'm going to reserve
[1:10:14] it to a group that I will call the elect
[1:10:17] lady. And I will not expose it to the
[1:10:21] general public. And how I'm going to
[1:10:23] protect it, I'm going to have a spirit
[1:10:26] of wisdom and revelation. And I will
[1:10:29] send that spirit and it will it will
[1:10:32] enlighten. It will ignite. Let me
[1:10:34] explain revelation to you in a very
[1:10:38] elementary way.
[1:10:43] Someone leads you by the hand into this
[1:10:46] auditorium
[1:10:48] and it's totally dark. There's no light.
[1:10:53] It's dark outside
[1:10:55] and it's as dark as a cave inside.
[1:10:58] I was in a cave once in the Oregon caves
[1:11:01] with my family
[1:11:04] and uh
[1:11:07] we were way down into the you know the
[1:11:10] caverns of the earth and our guide I was
[1:11:14] standing right beside him and he said
[1:11:17] there's a room here where we all look
[1:11:20] the same
[1:11:22] everybody will look the same when we get
[1:11:24] to this room that my this is going to be
[1:11:26] something so We got down into this place
[1:11:29] and well it was much higher than this
[1:11:31] ceiling here then and it was enormous
[1:11:35] place and we were on a little path and
[1:11:37] he was right there at the switch and he
[1:11:40] just flicked the switch and it was black
[1:11:42] as the inside of a cow if you've ever
[1:11:44] heard that term.
[1:11:47] It was you could feel it and he says see
[1:11:51] we all look the same. I thought that is
[1:11:54] right. He turned it back on. So you
[1:11:57] could come into here and it would be
[1:11:59] that dark. And I would say now just up
[1:12:03] here is a four steps and there's a
[1:12:07] platform and it's kind of a plum covered
[1:12:11] carpet on there. So you're trying to We
[1:12:15] have a black ebony piano.
[1:12:18] It's a grand piano
[1:12:21] and there's some microphones and we have
[1:12:23] a a beautiful pulpit that was made by
[1:12:26] one of our brothers. It's made out of an
[1:12:29] oak wood and it's a kind of a medium
[1:12:32] brown finish and I could try to describe
[1:12:35] everything and in the you you're you're
[1:12:38] straining everything and you're
[1:12:40] picturing it as I speak it. And after
[1:12:43] I've described most of the room, the
[1:12:46] light goes on.
[1:12:48] Oh, you say, you know, you were really
[1:12:52] accurately describing it, but I couldn't
[1:12:56] really get the full impact of it till
[1:12:58] the lights go on.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; And that is what a preacher can preach
[1:13:03] it.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; And you can hear it on a tape.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; You can read it in a book, but the light
[1:13:09] has to go on. And that's when the Holy
[1:13:12] Spirit of God comes down through the
[1:13:15] system into the soul and turns the
[1:13:18] lights on. And once you've seen it, it's
[1:13:22] an experience you have. And no one can
[1:13:24] ever say to you, "Ah, there's no there's
[1:13:26] no grand piano in the pulpit." Say, "I
[1:13:28] saw it. I was there myself. I saw it."
[1:13:31] Don't tell me there wasn't there. Don't
[1:13:33] tell me there's no pulpit there. I saw
[1:13:35] the pulpit. I handled it. I put my hands
[1:13:37] on it. That's what a revelation is. They
[1:13:40] can tell you all about a messenger. Tell
[1:13:42] you all about what he did. Tell you all
[1:13:44] about the miracles. Tell you all about
[1:13:46] Go to Malachi 4. Go back to Genesis the
[1:13:48] 18th chapter. Go over into Hebrews. Go
[1:13:51] into Revelation 10. You can hear 10:17.
[1:13:55] Uh Revelation the 3rd chapter verse 14.
[1:13:59] Messenger to the Leodysian church. Yeah.
[1:14:01] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I understand it. Yeah.
[1:14:03] I understand it. Then one day the light
[1:14:05] goes on. Oh my. I say it for myself.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; No one can ever argue you out of that.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; And if you haven't had that, that's more
[1:14:17] important to you. You cannot have it
[1:14:19] reasoned into you. You cannot have it.
[1:14:21] And let me say to you young people,
[1:14:24] you don't get it by natural birth.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Well, my mom and dad have it. I was born
[1:14:31] into a home. I've been in this church
[1:14:34] all my life. Brother Ed, you dedicated
[1:14:36] me. You held me as a baby. Wonderful.
[1:14:39] But that doesn't do it.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; You need to desire it and realize it's
[1:14:45] more important because this is the
[1:14:47] deciding factor.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; This is this is God's secret weapon of
[1:14:53] protection. He protects it.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; And that's why we preach it. You say,
[1:15:00] "Well, we it it doesn't come by
[1:15:02] teaching." No, that is exactly right.
[1:15:05] But on the other hand, once it's
[1:15:06] revealed to you, it does involve
[1:15:09] teaching. It does involve preaching. And
[1:15:11] that's why we are preaching to keep
[1:15:14] reminding the people because Satan is a
[1:15:16] liar
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; and the author of all lies. And we know
[1:15:22] that he will keep coming back to say,
[1:15:24] "Oh, that isn't it. Ah, you didn't get
[1:15:26] it. Oh, you're not a believer. You're
[1:15:28] not a Christian. Look what you did. Look
[1:15:30] what you did." And we come back and say,
[1:15:32] "But the blood of Jesus Christ is more
[1:15:35] powerful than any failing, any error."
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Any sin, if anyone has sinned, you
[1:15:44] confess it and it drops into the bleach
[1:15:47] of Jesus Christ, the blood of Jesus
[1:15:49] Christ, and you're pure from it.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:00] Jesus moving up towards
[1:16:04] Calvary.
[1:16:08] I help
[1:16:10] try to help yourself to absorb this.
[1:16:14] Here's now
[1:16:16] God in the fullness in a man called
[1:16:20] Jesus Christ.
[1:16:22] The whole world lies in darkness. The
[1:16:25] whole world is lost.
[1:16:29] And there's only one way it can be
[1:16:31] redeemed. And that is if he, the lamb of
[1:16:35] God, should follow a certain process
[1:16:40] and be slain in Calvary and hang on a
[1:16:43] cross. And he must be beaten. He must be
[1:16:45] bruised. He must wear a crown of thorns.
[1:16:48] He must go through this process.
[1:16:52] And the prophet said, "The greatest week
[1:16:55] in all the history of man." And that
[1:16:58] greatest week now is just moving. It's
[1:17:02] just started into process. And you know
[1:17:04] what this lamb of God did? You know what
[1:17:06] this one did?
[1:17:09] Held his peace
[1:17:12] and didn't say. He wouldn't expose what
[1:17:16] was happening. He wouldn't let it out.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; He kept the secret
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; and they said, "Art thou the Christ?"
[1:17:26] And he held his peace.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; He kept silent. And God protected the
[1:17:32] greatest weak in the history of mankind
[1:17:35] by saying nothing about it.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; I know we all fit into this place.
[1:17:48] Something happens, something takes
[1:17:49] place,
[1:17:52] and the first thing we do, we're on the
[1:17:54] telephone.
[1:17:56] You're doing the worst thing you can do.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; I got to tell somebody,
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; or are they going to fix it? Are they
[1:18:04] going to make it better? I got to spread
[1:18:06] this around the country. I got to send
[1:18:08] out an email and send it to all the
[1:18:10] people of everything that's happened.
[1:18:15] You ought to just keep it to yourself.
[1:18:18] Keep it a secret
[1:18:20] and let God work on it.
[1:18:23] A lot of times,
[1:18:25] a lot of times I've had people come and
[1:18:29] and I think that they should come to me.
[1:18:31] They say, "Brother Ed, this is what has
[1:18:35] happened. This is what has taken place.
[1:18:36] I need you to pray with me." I said, "I
[1:18:38] will." You know, we'll do that. And
[1:18:41] sometime, even almost before you've
[1:18:44] prayed for it, it's already been fixed.
[1:18:47] But if you let that all out to all kinds
[1:18:49] of other people, it just goes on and on
[1:18:52] and on. And those people don't know it's
[1:18:54] been repented over. It's been fixed. The
[1:18:57] Lord has forgotten it. But all kinds of
[1:19:00] people out there haven't forgotten it
[1:19:01] because they're just busy jabbering
[1:19:04] about it.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Say amen if you want to
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; and say ouch if you need to.
[1:19:19] Jesus moving up to this greatest week
[1:19:22] and he says nothing about it. He said
[1:19:25] it's the greatest week in history. the
[1:19:26] greatest celebration of all times.
[1:19:29] He was moving to the cross. He was
[1:19:31] moving to the sacrifice,
[1:19:34] the blood that would cover the sins and
[1:19:38] remove the sins of mankind. And he would
[1:19:41] pay the price for the whole the whole
[1:19:43] world and purchase back creation. But he
[1:19:46] wouldn't say a thing about it. And the
[1:19:49] disciples who had walked with him and
[1:19:51] participated in his ministry didn't know
[1:19:54] they were they were uh absolutely
[1:19:59] uh unaware of what was happening.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; They didn't know it.
[1:20:09] And the high priest arose and said unto
[1:20:11] him, "Answerest thou nothing?
[1:20:16] What is it which these witness against
[1:20:19] you?
[1:20:21] But Jesus held his peace. And the high
[1:20:25] priest answered and said unto him, I
[1:20:27] adure thee by the living God that thou
[1:20:30] tell us whether thou be the Christ, the
[1:20:32] son of God. And Jesus wouldn't let the
[1:20:35] secret out.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Kept it secret.
[1:20:47] Apostle Paul said, "For I neither
[1:20:50] received it." He's speaking this
[1:20:52] revelation. I never received it of man,
[1:20:54] neither was I taught it, but by the
[1:20:57] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:00] And now I come to a scripture which we
[1:21:03] can all quote, I'm sure, just out of our
[1:21:06] memory, off the top of our head of Luke
[1:21:10] 17:30. Even thus shall it be in the day
[1:21:13] when the son of man is revealed. Oh,
[1:21:18] but here's the key word.
[1:21:21] Here's the secret weapon.
[1:21:24] When the son of man is not when he's
[1:21:27] born, not son of man, when he's
[1:21:30] revealed,
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; he can come into full view as Jesus was
[1:21:36] on Calvary. the the mercy seat could
[1:21:38] come in full view, but they still don't
[1:21:41] re it's still not a revelation. And in
[1:21:44] the day when he will be revealed in the
[1:21:46] day when he will be uncovered and you
[1:21:49] can take and uncover
[1:21:52] uh uncover something because that's what
[1:21:55] revelation means in the scripture. It's
[1:21:58] uncovered. But even when it's uncovered,
[1:22:01] as it was with Jesus Christ when he was
[1:22:03] here, even though it's uncovered, it
[1:22:06] takes a revelation from God to know what
[1:22:10] it is that has been uncovered.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Do you know that to know that these
[1:22:22] times are the end times?
[1:22:24] That's not unique to you or I or in the
[1:22:27] message to this church.
[1:22:29] All kinds of churches throughout the
[1:22:30] whole country, they recognize this the
[1:22:33] end time. They see the signs.
[1:22:36] They recognize. How do they recognize
[1:22:38] it? Because they read the same Bible you
[1:22:40] and I read. They know it's the end time.
[1:22:45] But why is it I want to ask you
[1:22:47] something. Why is it that such critical
[1:22:52] scriptures
[1:22:56] are
[1:22:59] somehow they're passed over
[1:23:02] and such important
[1:23:05] even uh just a a paragraph
[1:23:11] is is is doesn't come to light. I just
[1:23:15] wonder about that.
[1:23:19] scholars and people that are so
[1:23:21] knowledgeable. How is it that it's
[1:23:23] passed over in the day when the Son of
[1:23:26] Man is revealed?
[1:23:34] Has it been revealed to you?
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to lay it on you. If it's been
[1:23:39] revealed,
[1:23:41] you will live the kind of life that that
[1:23:45] messenger brought.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; You'll live that kind of life. You won't
[1:23:50] be here today and gone tomorrow. That's
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; You won't be
[1:24:00] in euphoric state one day and then,
[1:24:05] well, it's not so real and you're gone.
[1:24:08] I'm talking about revelation doesn't
[1:24:11] leave a person.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Re nobody can argue you out of a
[1:24:16] revelation.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Never. Because you experienced it. Even
[1:24:21] if it cost your own life, you could not
[1:24:24] surrender up a revelation.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Because the lights went on.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; I saw it.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; I see it in the word of God. I see it.
[1:24:32] It's as clear. It's as clear as crystal.
[1:24:35] and I can never deny it because it's
[1:24:37] there.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; for your amen.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Now I just want to make some statements
[1:24:50] that I really felt inspired to write.
[1:24:52] Revelation is God's system of
[1:24:55] protection.
[1:24:57] The very thing that makes revelation to
[1:25:00] us as believers
[1:25:02] to make it so important, so vital is
[1:25:06] because it's God's only channel, only
[1:25:10] channel,
[1:25:12] only channel to reveal truth.
[1:25:16] He does not have a other channel. He
[1:25:20] reveals truth by revelation
[1:25:23] by which God makes known the mysteries
[1:25:26] of his word. And now here's the quote I
[1:25:29] said I would give you. The importance of
[1:25:31] revelation. Now before I give this
[1:25:34] quote,
[1:25:37] you answer this for yourself, please.
[1:25:42] You have a revelation
[1:25:45] of who this messenger is.
[1:25:49] You do.
[1:25:52] Can I hear the affirmative?
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; I have a revelation of who the messenger
[1:25:55] is. Amen.
[1:26:00] Now, I'd like if you could just in your
[1:26:02] imagination for a moment, in your
[1:26:04] vision,
[1:26:06] remove me off the scene
[1:26:09] and just bring Brother Brandham here in
[1:26:12] your thoughts
[1:26:14] and have him saying to you, dear ones,
[1:26:18] to the elect of Christ, looking down
[1:26:20] into your face,
[1:26:25] saying the importance of revelation
[1:26:29] by the spirit to a true believer
[1:26:35] can never be overemphasized.
[1:26:40] Revelation means more to you
[1:26:43] than perhaps you realize.
[1:26:47] Revelation means more to you. In other
[1:26:50] words, it's more important that the
[1:26:52] switch goes on. It's more important that
[1:26:56] the lights are turned on. It's more
[1:26:58] important that you become quickened
[1:27:00] inside. It's more important that you
[1:27:03] have this complete illumination, this
[1:27:06] realization that these things are true.
[1:27:10] This is the message. This is the
[1:27:13] messenger. This is what God has sent to
[1:27:16] pro. This is what divides. This is the
[1:27:19] dividing line between the elect and
[1:27:21] non-elect. between we'll say the
[1:27:24] initiated.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; This is the initiation process. God when
[1:27:29] he when he turns the light on that is
[1:27:32] the initiation. You're in the group.
[1:27:35] You're in the elect. You're in the club.
[1:27:38] You're in the society. You're in the
[1:27:41] You're in the bride. I'll put it that
[1:27:43] way.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; You need to see that.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; You need to see that. It's not coming to
[1:27:49] this church. Amen.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; It's not Cloverdale Bible Way. That's
[1:27:53] not the initiation.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; It's not even being baptized. All kinds
[1:27:57] of people been in the tank and gone down
[1:27:59] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:28:01] they're gone.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; But if you have a revelation, someone
[1:28:06] might say, "That's exactly right. That's
[1:28:09] exactly what the word of God says. I'm
[1:28:11] going to be baptized in the name of the
[1:28:13] Lord Jesus Christ." Wonderful.
[1:28:17] And a little while later,
[1:28:19] you know, I don't know what happens in
[1:28:22] their lives, but they're gone. They give
[1:28:24] it all up. They turn against it.
[1:28:28] Do they have a revelation? Not by my not
[1:28:30] by my books. Never had a revelation.
[1:28:36] And if it means more to you
[1:28:40] and it can be so simple, it's not some
[1:28:44] big long process. But the light has to
[1:28:47] go on
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; in your own self.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; And friends, when that light goes on,
[1:28:54] let me tell you, a lot of your troubles
[1:28:56] will vanish.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; A lot of your troubles will vanish.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; You'll be able to say, I don't care who
[1:29:05] you are. I don't care what what age you
[1:29:07] are. I don't care what status in life
[1:29:09] you're at but you'll be able to say when
[1:29:11] you when you are facing something or
[1:29:14] you're facing a decision whatever it
[1:29:16] might be and there isn't anybody here
[1:29:18] but what you face decisions on a regular
[1:29:19] basis from day to day you need a guide
[1:29:22] you need a protection and God has given
[1:29:25] you this protection to protect of all
[1:29:27] things friends I talked about home I
[1:29:29] talked about family I talked about
[1:29:31] health talked about car talked about all
[1:29:33] of these things talked about information
[1:29:35] and your ID and all this protection all
[1:29:37] the security. What God is really
[1:29:39] interested in is protecting your
[1:29:41] spiritual life,
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; your spiritual walk,
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; and what did he give to protect that?
[1:29:49] The word.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; The word. And we hear the word, the
[1:29:52] word, the word. But it's not just the
[1:29:55] word. It's the revealed word.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; It's got to reveal it to you on a
[1:30:03] personal level in your situation.
[1:30:09] As I said earlier, you're not born into
[1:30:11] it. You're not born into revelation by
[1:30:14] natural birth. It does not come by
[1:30:17] reasoning or by argument. You cannot
[1:30:20] receive a revelation by teaching.
[1:30:22] Although revelation needs to be taught
[1:30:24] once it's revealed to you once it's
[1:30:26] revealed to you. You do need you need do
[1:30:29] need to have teaching because the
[1:30:31] scripture says speaking the truth in
[1:30:34] love may grow up into him grow up into
[1:30:37] him in all things which is the head even
[1:30:40] Christ. That's after a person's had a
[1:30:42] revelation from whom the whole body
[1:30:45] fitly joined together and compacted by
[1:30:48] that which every joint supplieth
[1:30:50] according to the effectual working in
[1:30:52] the measure of every part maketh
[1:30:54] increase of the body into the edifying
[1:30:57] of itself in love. And Paul said further
[1:31:00] in Colossians 2 and 7, rooted and built
[1:31:04] up and established in the faith as you
[1:31:07] have been taught abounding therein with
[1:31:11] thanksgiving. They they they
[1:31:14] have that foundation which is the
[1:31:17] revelation of what the word of God
[1:31:20] actually is.
[1:31:26] Perhaps I can emphasize the importance
[1:31:27] of it.
[1:31:29] I knew that this would be something that
[1:31:31] you'd have to ponder and I'm going to
[1:31:33] overwork this word of revelation. I'm
[1:31:37] going to overwork it because it has been
[1:31:38] overworked and it's been misunderstood
[1:31:41] and it needs to be understood. You need
[1:31:43] to really know what it is.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; It's amazing.
[1:31:52] It's amazing.
[1:31:55] We have here this one book.
[1:32:00] And here's here here here's the Old
[1:32:02] Testament
[1:32:04] from Genesis to Malachi.
[1:32:06] And we have the Jews that hold to that.
[1:32:13] And the Jews for all these hundreds of
[1:32:17] years, centuries,
[1:32:19] have not yet, they read the same
[1:32:22] scriptures you read, but have not yet
[1:32:26] found that this word is speaking of
[1:32:29] Jesus Christ. And why? The Bible says,
[1:32:34] the Apostle Paul said, "God hath blinded
[1:32:38] their eyes." and people trying to see,
[1:32:41] oh, we're going to convert this Jew and
[1:32:43] get them. If God has blinded their eyes,
[1:32:45] you can't say if I say to someone blind
[1:32:48] and bring a blind man up here, you see
[1:32:50] this beautiful flower? It's yellow and
[1:32:52] it's brown in the interior and it's just
[1:32:55] magnificent and there's a lily beside
[1:32:57] it. Can't you understand that? No, I
[1:33:01] can't understand it because I can't see
[1:33:03] it.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Well, it it is the shades of it in it is
[1:33:07] so marvelous. and just tantalizes my
[1:33:09] whole mind, my whole being. It's so
[1:33:12] magnificent.
[1:33:14] Says, "Sorry, just can't see it. Just
[1:33:17] can't see it." But the eyes were opened.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; He'd say, "I see just what you see. I
[1:33:26] see it is indeed yellow. It is indeed
[1:33:29] beautiful. And it is indeed
[1:33:30] magnificent." Do you catch my point?
[1:33:33] Yes.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; This one book
[1:33:39] and all that has happened and all the
[1:33:41] revelation of Jesus Christ and the and
[1:33:45] the incredible manifestation. The Jews
[1:33:48] don't see him.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; They don't see that Christ was the
[1:33:51] Messiah. Oh, I say, "Well, those blind
[1:33:54] Jews." Oh, just a second. Here we got
[1:33:57] the New Testament. And somehow we
[1:34:00] Gentiles have have been have have
[1:34:03] managed to make over over 3,000
[1:34:09] denominations out of the New Testament.
[1:34:12] I ask you out of any serious thinking
[1:34:14] person, how did they manage to do that?
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you why.
[1:34:24] It's not been Christ of this Bible has
[1:34:28] not been a revelation to them.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; If the lights go on,
[1:34:35] are you going to say that's a red
[1:34:37] flower?
[1:34:39] That's a green flower.
[1:34:42] No, I say it's a yellow flower. Okay,
[1:34:44] you go and have your own church. It's a
[1:34:46] red flower. You have your own church.
[1:34:48] It's a green flower. I'll have my
[1:34:50] church. It's a yellow flower. And I
[1:34:52] identified with a yellow because that's
[1:34:54] the truth. And I believe we have it.
[1:34:56] [Applause]
[1:35:02] And 3,000 people look at the same book
[1:35:06] and find a different color.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; It's this way. No, it's this way. Well,
[1:35:10] you go and have yours. I'll go and have
[1:35:12] mine. It's take take one little weed
[1:35:14] scripture.
[1:35:18] You know, Friday night,
[1:35:21] we're going to have something regarding
[1:35:22] the colonies and people who have come
[1:35:24] off the colonies. And I just want to say
[1:35:26] to you that have come from the colonies
[1:35:28] and God has delivered you from that.
[1:35:31] That entire organization is based on
[1:35:35] just a very very few
[1:35:38] uh uh very fall small segments out of
[1:35:43] the Bible.
[1:35:46] And they have that all things in common.
[1:35:49] All things in common. We have all things
[1:35:51] in common. That's one of the main pillar
[1:35:54] doctrines. We have all things in common.
[1:35:57] What a fallacy. What a falsehood.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; The only people that have it are the
[1:36:02] leaders.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; You have all things in common, but the
[1:36:04] people walk out with just the shirts on
[1:36:06] their back. We have all things in
[1:36:08] common, but they work there for next to
[1:36:10] nothing. And you've been delivered out
[1:36:12] of such a thing. I think praise be to
[1:36:15] God.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; How do they get that just out of out of
[1:36:19] the New Testament? I can tell you one
[1:36:20] thing, and if you're ever talking to
[1:36:22] your relatives or whoever back there,
[1:36:24] yeah, I'll tell you one thing. The
[1:36:26] apostles never went out and bought a
[1:36:28] farm.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; The apostles never went out and had
[1:36:33] 10,000 pigs
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; or 30,000 turkeys.
[1:36:39] Everybody from the colony should be
[1:36:41] saying, "Amen."
[1:36:42] That's not in the book of Acts. They
[1:36:44] never did do it. It's a falsehood.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; It appeased to certain people.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Better get off that, I guess.
[1:36:58] Here's what a revelation is. Going to
[1:37:01] conclude in a few more minutes. In the
[1:37:03] message, works as faith expressed. These
[1:37:05] next two quotes,
[1:37:08] you became a sinner by nature.
[1:37:12] You didn't want to be,
[1:37:14] but you heard the gospel and faith
[1:37:17] cometh by hearing. This important
[1:37:20] statement now and revelation comes by
[1:37:24] hearing because he went on to say faith
[1:37:27] is a revelation.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; You know, I've had I've experienced
[1:37:36] a few things in my life. I wish there
[1:37:39] were a lot more when God dropped it
[1:37:42] down.
[1:37:44] And when it dropped it down, it's it's
[1:37:47] all it's it's all over. It's already
[1:37:49] finished.
[1:37:55] When God speaks something, Brother
[1:37:57] Brandham says concerning the visions, he
[1:38:00] said, "Now, if he had a vision that God
[1:38:03] was going to raise George Washington, he
[1:38:05] said he called the world to come and see
[1:38:08] it."
[1:38:10] When you have a revelation, it's already
[1:38:11] finished. It's already done. It's as
[1:38:14] though it was yesterday. It's already
[1:38:16] finished. I see it. It's already done.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Nobody can ever It's not even something
[1:38:21] that's up for debate.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; It's already done. It's already
[1:38:25] finished.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Just for personal testimony,
[1:38:31] when I'd slipped and herniated the disc
[1:38:33] in my neck and against the spinal cord,
[1:38:36] it's over 11 years ago now.
[1:38:40] And I can take you to the very spot
[1:38:43] in my house,
[1:38:46] and I was in such excruciating pain. And
[1:38:49] the pain was overcoming me, and I began
[1:38:52] to break down just a wee bit.
[1:38:55] And I just said, "Lord, if thou wilt,
[1:39:00] thou can make me whole." And that was
[1:39:03] all I prepared to say. That's all that
[1:39:05] was coming out of my mouth. And I can't
[1:39:08] tell you what it was. It wasn't some
[1:39:10] super duper flash or thunder or
[1:39:12] lightning. It just something issued out
[1:39:15] from me. And I said, "I will be thou
[1:39:18] whole." And I knew it was over. I came
[1:39:21] and stood behind this pulpit in the same
[1:39:24] amount of pain and said to you people
[1:39:28] God told me I will be thou whole.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; And I said not better
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; whole not improved whole. I stand here
[1:39:39] today as a testimony of those of that
[1:39:43] thing of what God did. That is a
[1:39:46] revelation.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it. And if you'd
[1:39:49] have saw me, I had my arm up over my
[1:39:51] head schedule. I even went in to see Dr.
[1:39:53] Richard Chan, who's had over 800 spinal
[1:39:57] operations,
[1:39:59] one of the finest specialists in in
[1:40:03] Royal Colombian Hospital. And I went
[1:40:05] into his place and said, "I'm here for
[1:40:08] the operation."
[1:40:11] And he told me, "There is no way for it
[1:40:14] to recover by itself. you're you have to
[1:40:17] have this emergency operation. And I
[1:40:20] asked him just give me a time to pray
[1:40:22] about it. I came right here, called
[1:40:24] Brother Lance, Brother Tony, Brother
[1:40:27] Tom. I said, when I have a serious case,
[1:40:32] I tell people,
[1:40:34] follow the scripture to the letter
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; cuz I have a revelation that this is the
[1:40:41] absolute truth and there is no other
[1:40:44] way. It's not what I think about it,
[1:40:46] it's what it says.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; And God will stand behind it.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; And if he remains silent, that's his
[1:40:54] that's his privilege.
[1:40:58] When I have people here, some of you
[1:41:01] have been here
[1:41:03] with serious cases, life-threatening
[1:41:06] cases, and I read James 5. If you're
[1:41:10] afflicted, any man afflicted, let him
[1:41:14] pray.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Not let the preacher pray, the pastor
[1:41:18] pray, the deacons pray, let him pray.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Is any sick? Let him call for the
[1:41:25] elders. let him call, not the preacher
[1:41:28] to run over and say, "I heard you're
[1:41:29] sick. I'm here to pray for you."
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, you prayed. Nothing
[1:41:33] happened." Well, of course, it didn't
[1:41:34] follow the word. Had all kinds of people
[1:41:37] are sick. Said, "Well, I've been sick.
[1:41:38] Nobody even prayed for me." But did you
[1:41:40] call?
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; It's back on you.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; That's the word of God.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Any afflicted? And then the second thing
[1:41:50] I say is I always take the message, be
[1:41:53] certain of God.
[1:41:55] And I tell the people, read that because
[1:41:58] brother Brandham says, "How many times
[1:41:59] in my life I've turned over every stone
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; and I've turned over every stone." If he
[1:42:06] still remains silent, he's still God.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Friends, you have to come to that place.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; You can't be somebody who whimpers
[1:42:18] along. Well, I prayed and God didn't
[1:42:20] answer me and I prayed and I want this
[1:42:22] and I want that and he didn't answer me.
[1:42:24] Get over that.
[1:42:26] That's immature childhood. God wants men
[1:42:29] and women be able to take the word of
[1:42:32] God and put the gloves on.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; I said to those brothers
[1:42:39] are here.
[1:42:41] I said,
[1:42:43] I'm not here to have you pray for me.
[1:42:48] I'm here to have you pray with me.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. I said the scripture says when I
[1:42:55] have people here I tell them the
[1:42:58] scripture says is any man afflicted let
[1:43:01] him pray I have come to pray.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; I ask you brothers to pray with me.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; And the second thing I tell people is
[1:43:13] read and carry
[1:43:16] be certain of God. And I've been
[1:43:18] carrying that with me.
[1:43:20] I've been absorbing that message and
[1:43:22] doing what I tell others to do. We knelt
[1:43:26] and prayed.
[1:43:28] Did anything happen? Not a thing.
[1:43:32] Not a thing. I walked out of here
[1:43:34] exactly the same. But I knew God had
[1:43:38] already spoken to me and said, "I will
[1:43:41] be thou whole." I had already said it
[1:43:43] here over the pull pit. I will be thou
[1:43:46] whole.
[1:43:51] waited two weeks, nothing happened. My
[1:43:55] wife says, "I can't see you suffer like
[1:43:57] this. You've I lost 10 lbs in two
[1:44:00] weeks." I went right back to Dr. Richard
[1:44:03] Chan sat in his chair with my wife
[1:44:05] beside me and I said, "I'm here for the
[1:44:07] operation."
[1:44:09] The man who told me there was no other
[1:44:11] way out looked at me and said, "But how
[1:44:13] are you?" I said, "Well, I've lost 10
[1:44:16] pounds in two weeks. if that means
[1:44:18] anything. But he said, "But how are
[1:44:20] you?" I said, "I'm the same."
[1:44:23] I said, "I've come here. Let's let's
[1:44:25] let's get it over with, Dr. Chan."
[1:44:29] But he said, "Well, but maybe I should
[1:44:31] check you over." I said, "All right." Go
[1:44:34] into the next room, pricks me, does a
[1:44:37] number of things, puts me through some
[1:44:38] tests, comes back and says, he says,
[1:44:40] "Well, you're not any you're not any
[1:44:41] worse." I said, "No, but I'm not any
[1:44:43] better."
[1:44:46] And I was pushing him. The very man that
[1:44:49] says there's no other way for it to
[1:44:51] happen. I said, "Let's do it. Dr. Chan,
[1:44:54] I've come here for the operation."
[1:44:57] And he refused to do it. After three
[1:45:00] times, refused to do it. He says, "I
[1:45:03] think that you should wait." I said,
[1:45:04] "Good."
[1:45:08] It was seven weeks.
[1:45:11] It was all over.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's the same God.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, that was 11 12
[1:45:24] years ago." Do you know that Brother
[1:45:25] Bram talks about miracles that took
[1:45:27] place 20 and 30 years ago? And he talks
[1:45:29] about them as though they happened just
[1:45:31] yesterday. Hey, there's no time with
[1:45:33] God. What's 12 years? It's nothing. It's
[1:45:35] the same as it happened last night.
[1:45:37] Hallelujah.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; It's the same God.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; How did it happen? Well, faith's a
[1:45:43] revelation. I can have faith because he
[1:45:46] revealed it was done.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Are you saved?
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; You know you're saved.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; You know it's finished. You know it's
[1:45:56] over. Is it a revelation that you're
[1:45:59] saved? You know you're saved. Is the
[1:46:01] Godhead a revelation to you? Is baptism
[1:46:04] a revelation to you? Is this message a
[1:46:07] revelation to you? I'm asking you, is it
[1:46:09] a revelation to you? Then nothing can
[1:46:12] take it out of your being.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:26] I just related my own.
[1:46:29] There's been quite a number even here in
[1:46:31] this congregation.
[1:46:33] And God will just speak something
[1:46:36] and it's the same as it it's same as it
[1:46:38] happened yesterday. Same. It was already
[1:46:40] finished. It's already over. And when
[1:46:42] God drops that into your heart, it's
[1:46:44] done. It is done.
[1:46:56] I'm preaching this morning
[1:46:58] because
[1:47:02] well
[1:47:05] I want to say it but I want to say it in
[1:47:06] a kind of a kind way but sometimes it's
[1:47:09] no not a way to say it kind.
[1:47:13] I want to I want to convey this to you
[1:47:15] in such a way
[1:47:18] that Satan's ability to buffet you will
[1:47:22] be greatly restricted and reduced
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; and that any thought of going to the
[1:47:32] right or going to the left or
[1:47:37] or the world being
[1:47:41] so attractive
[1:47:44] And the world can come in so many many
[1:47:46] forms. He's such a subtle enemy.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; But if God gives you a real revelation
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; of what this message is all about, it
[1:47:56] will change your entire composure and
[1:47:58] your entire approach to it.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Can I take about another five minutes
[1:48:03] and I'm going to close.
[1:48:09] This is what I didn't come to, but I'll
[1:48:10] just introduce it because I want to come
[1:48:12] to it.
[1:48:16] There's something that's
[1:48:20] you might say.
[1:48:23] Do you ever get perplexed, Brother Ed?
[1:48:25] Yeah, I do. I get perplexed.
[1:48:28] not about, you know, just the little
[1:48:30] things of life, but I get perplexed
[1:48:32] about big things, important things.
[1:48:36] I'm going to drop one on you that I get
[1:48:38] perplexed about.
[1:48:41] And and perplexed because
[1:48:45] I want to know. I want a revelation of
[1:48:48] it.
[1:48:50] And I can't settle back on my hunches
[1:48:53] and just settle back in my easy chair.
[1:48:56] And it remains there all the time. You
[1:48:58] say, "What is this great thing?" Well,
[1:49:00] one of them is.
[1:49:03] Brother Brandham says the rapture
[1:49:06] is a revelation.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:49:13] don't let us miss this revelation.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Don't let us miss this revelation.
[1:49:20] And quite frankly,
[1:49:26] I have great concern
[1:49:30] if we just, you know, go along on, you
[1:49:34] know, live stream and, you know, kind of
[1:49:38] take it as it goes and I go to church. I
[1:49:40] go to Cloverdale Bible Way.
[1:49:44] I listen to a tape now and then
[1:49:47] or we have a great service and then you
[1:49:49] know
[1:49:50] life becomes quite ordinary.
[1:49:54] church is quite ordinary
[1:49:57] everything and we're more involved in
[1:49:59] kind of the natural
[1:50:03] relationships between brothers and
[1:50:05] sisters and families and
[1:50:11] what I'm talking about goes so far
[1:50:12] beyond that they don't even belong on
[1:50:14] the same planet
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; don't even belong on the same planet I'm
[1:50:20] talking about being caught away I'm
[1:50:23] talking about a sweep that's going to
[1:50:25] come. I'm talking about something this
[1:50:28] prophet one of his last services says uh
[1:50:31] faith faith is a revelation and the
[1:50:34] rapture is a revelation saying oh God
[1:50:38] reveal these things to me make make them
[1:50:40] known I can't say that the rapture to me
[1:50:43] is as though it happened yesterday but I
[1:50:46] believe it can be that real I believe
[1:50:48] that the revelation of the rapture and
[1:50:51] that is why brother Brandham says you
[1:50:53] know I I can take you to quotes that go
[1:50:55] both directions. Say the seventh seal is
[1:50:58] open. Say the seventh seal isn't open,
[1:50:59] but it's somewhere in the in the middle
[1:51:01] there. I saw it goes in a three-fold
[1:51:04] because it is a shout. It is a voice. It
[1:51:06] is a trumpet. It goes back in
[1:51:07] three-fold. He says uh it it passed by
[1:51:11] um I saw the first part of it and then
[1:51:14] the second part no he said yesterday
[1:51:16] then he changed it. He just changed it
[1:51:17] because he in in his conversation in the
[1:51:20] way he was bringing to the people he
[1:51:21] said and the second part and the third
[1:51:23] part passed by in an unknown tongue. He
[1:51:25] said I did see it. I did see it. And he
[1:51:29] was talking about the talking about the
[1:51:31] in the seventh seal. He's talking about
[1:51:32] the coming of Christ. You know, this
[1:51:34] thing, this thing of the coming of
[1:51:36] Christ and the rapture of Christ is just
[1:51:38] as mysterious as when he was here on
[1:51:40] earth and the disciples were trying to
[1:51:42] see it and trying to understand it and
[1:51:43] what is this all about and what is this
[1:51:45] great message he had and all this power
[1:51:47] and where's it gone and what's happened
[1:51:48] to the message and and the secretary of
[1:51:50] the church, he's he's gone and hung
[1:51:52] himself and he's betrayed our Lord and
[1:51:55] and uh and the and all the all the
[1:51:57] leaders and the trustees and the deacons
[1:51:59] or whatever more the apostles at that
[1:52:01] time, great apostles of God, They're all
[1:52:03] holed up in a in a room and the doors
[1:52:05] are locked and the windows are barred
[1:52:07] and and how many of you people want to
[1:52:10] join that church.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; So, well, look at this. You know, the
[1:52:16] whole thing looks like it's all falling
[1:52:18] apart and we're coming to the greatest
[1:52:20] week in history.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; But there was something
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; in the soul of those men. I don't
[1:52:29] understand everything, but I know what
[1:52:32] he said is true. And I know what's going
[1:52:34] to happen, and I don't understand
[1:52:36] everything. I must go to Jerusalem, and
[1:52:38] the son of man must die. All of these
[1:52:40] things I have the son of man come in
[1:52:42] this generation, speak to a prophet's
[1:52:44] mouth, says a rapture is a revelation.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Don't you people sit here? Don't you
[1:52:52] people come here to this church after
[1:52:54] this service and say, "Well, I I'm just
[1:52:57] going to take this on a nonchalant. I'm
[1:52:59] just going to take this in a kind of a
[1:53:01] an an average way. This is not an
[1:53:03] average message. It I'm not talking
[1:53:05] about this message. I'm talking about
[1:53:07] the message you received. It's not an
[1:53:08] average message. It is a rapture call.
[1:53:12] It is the very word. That word itself
[1:53:15] has the power to change your body.
[1:53:22] Amen.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; And transform you
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; from this mortal to an immortal.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; It's going to be as real as we're
[1:53:32] sitting here this morning. Some are
[1:53:33] going to be transformed. They're going
[1:53:35] to go into another dimension.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; I don't know how, but they're going to
[1:53:39] do it. And people are going to be on
[1:53:40] this side and people are going to be on
[1:53:42] the other side.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; People still going to be aging. people
[1:53:46] going to be in a youthful body and
[1:53:48] cannot be changed and cannot age.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; That's what his word says. The raptures
[1:53:54] of revelation
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; and the seventh seal was open and there
[1:54:00] was great silence.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; And this is where I'm perplexed. Say,
[1:54:06] Lord,
[1:54:10] I take it back whenever I get to a
[1:54:12] place. Is it all right that I'm so
[1:54:14] personal this morning?
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; I take it back.
[1:54:19] I've counseledled with some of you and
[1:54:20] you have such dilemas and such
[1:54:24] involvements and such entanglements and
[1:54:26] life becomes so complex and and when I
[1:54:29] get something like that, I say to the
[1:54:31] people, man or woman, I say, "Well, do
[1:54:35] you believe you're a son of God?"
[1:54:40] "Yeah, I do." That's where I have to
[1:54:43] start.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Do you actually believe you're a
[1:54:46] daughter of God? Do you believe you're a
[1:54:48] daughter of God?
[1:54:50] I do.
[1:54:52] I need that affirmative.
[1:54:54] And then if you can say that, then we
[1:54:57] have some grounds. Then we can proceed.
[1:55:00] But if you can't say that, then there's
[1:55:03] there is no place to begin. There's no
[1:55:06] starting place. Say, "Are you a son of
[1:55:08] God? Where's my Where's my Where's the
[1:55:11] bottom line with brother Ed?
[1:55:14] I hope this helpful to you.
[1:55:18] When life gets real difficult,
[1:55:21] it gets real complex
[1:55:24] and it will.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; It will.
[1:55:31] I'd encourage you, in fact, as I would
[1:55:33] instruct you, you get alone.
[1:55:36] You get someplace where it's quiet.
[1:55:41] Look up.
[1:55:43] Say, "Father,
[1:55:46] so many things I don't understand.
[1:55:49] I desire. I want to know. I desire. And
[1:55:52] I believe I should know.
[1:55:56] But I will start by telling you
[1:55:59] I believe
[1:56:01] that this word that you sent
[1:56:03] was not of man. I believe it was you
[1:56:07] that was speaking.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; I believe it was you that was that
[1:56:10] pillar of fire.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; I believe it was you that was revealing
[1:56:14] the secrets of the heart. That was you
[1:56:16] all down through these stations of of of
[1:56:19] the of the message. That was you. That
[1:56:21] wasn't a man. That wasn't William
[1:56:22] Brandham. That was you. And that's where
[1:56:24] you really need to start. And when you
[1:56:27] start talking to him and when you start
[1:56:29] when you start thanking him for those
[1:56:32] things, you'll feel his presence move
[1:56:34] in. Amen.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to conclude conclude now
[1:56:39] with what Murphy said. Murphy said
[1:56:42] something very very very
[1:56:46] deep as he concluded his service
[1:56:49] something that I had never heard before.
[1:56:52] But he told how he was because he was
[1:56:55] speaking on yielding and that's what I
[1:56:57] want to end this service on. how he
[1:57:00] yielded himself to an evil spirit.
[1:57:04] And that evil spirit would actually
[1:57:06] begin to move a small dish around on a
[1:57:09] cardboard where he'd put a lot of words.
[1:57:13] And he's looking at the moon and giving
[1:57:15] himself completely completely. And here
[1:57:18] was the key. He said, "And as you just
[1:57:20] give yourself and give yourself,
[1:57:24] press yourself and surrender yourself
[1:57:28] to this whole spirit world." He said,
[1:57:33] "You could feel that evil spirit
[1:57:35] coming."
[1:57:37] I can tell you, I knew that was true.
[1:57:40] I've had that many times.
[1:57:43] even praying with people, even talking
[1:57:45] to people. And I will tell them in
[1:57:47] counseling, that thing is an evil
[1:57:49] spirit. It's a demon spirit.
[1:57:53] And when you start thinking on a certain
[1:57:55] thing, you start going in that direction
[1:57:57] and you can actually feel that spirit
[1:57:59] come. And you know what, friends? Very,
[1:58:03] very rarely do I have anyone say, "No, I
[1:58:06] can't feel it."
[1:58:08] Almost 100%
[1:58:10] people say, "I can feel it. I do feel it
[1:58:14] when it comes. And I said, that's when
[1:58:16] you have to resist it. That is a that is
[1:58:18] the presence of a demon spirit. Friends,
[1:58:21] we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[1:58:23] but against principalities and powers.
[1:58:26] Do you believe that? We're not just here
[1:58:28] a lot of human individuals in in bodies
[1:58:31] of clay and flesh. This is a spiritual
[1:58:34] warfare that we're in. That's right.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; And I tell God,
[1:58:42] "Father, I believe that was you." And as
[1:58:45] I give myself to it,
[1:58:48] you know what happens? I begin to feel a
[1:58:52] different presence coming and it's his
[1:58:54] presence. And even here in this service,
[1:58:57] if you sense that, you start giving
[1:59:00] yourself to it. It's a holy presence.
[1:59:03] It's a pure presence. It's God's
[1:59:06] presence. It's the presence of Jehovah.
[1:59:09] It is the presence of the Lord Jesus
[1:59:11] Christ. And the only way that brother
[1:59:13] Brandham could be effective is he just
[1:59:15] gave himself to it. And he gave himself
[1:59:17] and he talked to the people and talked
[1:59:19] to them because he was pouring himself
[1:59:21] into that direction. Pouring himself
[1:59:22] into this person's need and he didn't
[1:59:25] know whether they were in sin. They
[1:59:26] didn't know what it was. They didn't
[1:59:28] know what but he had confidence in his
[1:59:30] call. And he knew that God was going to
[1:59:33] speak and utter through him. and reveal
[1:59:35] what that individual's need was. And
[1:59:37] he'd give himself to it. And that's what
[1:59:39] made it work.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; That's what made it work.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; And I'm closing this service by saying,
[1:59:46] "And it'll work for you.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; It'll work for you." If I can convince
[1:59:51] you people to give yourself and
[1:59:53] surrender yourself to the Holy Spirit.
[1:59:55] Don't sit in a service and say, "Well,
[1:59:57] it's going to, you know, it's supposed
[1:59:58] to end in another few minutes and we
[2:00:00] need to get home and so on so forth."
[2:00:02] What you need to do after today or after
[2:00:04] this meeting is not nearly as important
[2:00:06] is what I'm saying to you. If that
[2:00:09] presence moves near you, if you feel
[2:00:11] that presence, if you feel that very
[2:00:13] being of Christ himself moving, what a
[2:00:17] great honor, what a great privilege this
[2:00:19] is. And here's a little vessel trying to
[2:00:21] tell you, give yourself to him. Give
[2:00:23] yourself to him. Just yield to him.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Do you know what I mean?
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Do you know what I'm saying? And I said
[2:00:31] on Wednesday night, people have to learn
[2:00:33] how to yield. Say, "How do I do it?"
[2:00:37] That's how you do it.
[2:00:40] You feel his presence coming near you.
[2:00:43] Then you just focus all your heart and
[2:00:47] mind and soul
[2:00:50] and just keep moving and pressing in
[2:00:52] that direction.
[2:00:54] I'm giving myself.
[2:00:58] Brother Murphy said
[2:01:02] and he took the surrender of the
[2:01:04] Japanese in the Second World War.
[2:01:08] He said some powerful things.
[2:01:11] Said the emperor could not come with any
[2:01:14] conditions.
[2:01:17] the US general come on a battleship
[2:01:21] but the emperor of Japan come in a
[2:01:23] little boat to climb up onto the ship
[2:01:26] because there's humility involved.
[2:01:28] That's the next thing. If we come in
[2:01:30] humility, we come humble.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; Who cares what kind of a person we are
[2:01:35] or how we dress or what home we're from
[2:01:38] or how what our status in life is? We
[2:01:40] come with nothing. That's right.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; We're not strong,
[2:01:45] you know, people as such.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Young people, young men got your
[2:01:49] strength and young ladies got your
[2:01:51] beauty. It's nothing that could be gone
[2:01:53] in a few minutes.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; So, we yield.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; We give ourselves
[2:02:01] and God begins to take over in our
[2:02:03] lives.
[2:02:04] You may not have some great surge of
[2:02:06] feeling or lightning or flashes of of
[2:02:09] anything, but God begins to move and
[2:02:12] move through you and make you the kind
[2:02:14] of vessel that he wants. Do you believe
[2:02:16] that?
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Friends, that how that's how it works.
[2:02:25] And I feel like I've been giving kind of
[2:02:26] a lesson this morning.
[2:02:30] But if a messenger says to me and to you
[2:02:34] revelation
[2:02:36] is more important to you
[2:02:39] than you can realize
[2:02:41] then I would just take that and I know
[2:02:44] that there's I happen to know God help
[2:02:48] us. I happen to know there's a lot of
[2:02:50] you, a lot of the young people, young
[2:02:52] men and young ladies. Your parents, you
[2:02:55] know, your parents have it
[2:02:57] and it hasn't happened to you quite like
[2:02:59] that yet. I'd use all your energy. Lose
[2:03:03] all, use all the alertness of your mind
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; to give yourself in that one direction
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; and say, "Brother Ed spoke to me this
[2:03:11] morning, and the Holy Spirit witnessed
[2:03:13] it down in my heart." And you may be
[2:03:15] here and you may be here because your
[2:03:17] friends are here or your wife or your
[2:03:19] husband or whatever more. I don't know
[2:03:21] why you may be here but that's why we
[2:03:23] don't put a great emphasis on on uh you
[2:03:27] know the school or the Sunday school or
[2:03:32] some program or the music or something
[2:03:35] else. Those are accessories. But the
[2:03:38] main thing is if we don't have
[2:03:40] revelation those things mean nothing.
[2:03:41] Amen.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; A personal revelation.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; When a person has that, the word of God
[2:03:50] is so alive. When you sing, the singing
[2:03:52] is different. When you sing a special,
[2:03:55] the special is different. When you play
[2:03:57] an instrument, it is different. When you
[2:03:58] read the word, it is different. And the
[2:04:00] services are different. And the
[2:04:02] preaching comes to you different because
[2:04:04] God give you revelation.
[2:04:08] God grant it in the name of our Lord
[2:04:10] Jesus Christ.
[2:04:12] Heavenly Father,
[2:04:15] giver of every good gift and the gift
[2:04:17] we're speaking of this morning,
[2:04:20] the Holy Spirit.
[2:04:23] Grant the Holy Spirit come to this
[2:04:25] waiting audience,
[2:04:27] attentive audience, respectful audience,
[2:04:31] listening, Lord, to your word.
[2:04:34] And I desire, Father, that they might be
[2:04:36] able to
[2:04:38] leave this sanctuary this morning,
[2:04:43] having such an impact, not of a man, not
[2:04:46] of a a message, not of the way it was
[2:04:48] spoken, not merely of the quotes, but
[2:04:51] would you take them, Lord? Would you
[2:04:54] would you just anchor them down in the
[2:04:56] heart and the soul of every individual?
[2:05:01] And Lord, I want to ask and I pray that
[2:05:03] you will convey it to them.
[2:05:06] Those that may not have had this
[2:05:08] experience,
[2:05:10] I'm going to soon ask them to stand.
[2:05:14] And Lord, when they do, I pray that you
[2:05:17] will drop down something very glorious,
[2:05:21] something marvelous. drop down into them
[2:05:25] the spirit of wisdom and of revelation
[2:05:29] according to Paul's gospel in Ephesians
[2:05:32] the first chapter drop it down
[2:05:36] I cannot give it no man can give it they
[2:05:40] can't give it to themselves
[2:05:42] but you can give it Lord
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; let it be let it be something sovereign
[2:05:47] and divine
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; you said through your messenger that the
[2:05:51] revelation
[2:05:53] is sovereign. It is sovereign. You give
[2:05:56] it to them that you would. I pray,
[2:06:00] Father, that this will be so.
[2:06:03] What I speak of, oh God, will certainly
[2:06:07] be a baptism of the Holy Spirit as you
[2:06:10] reveal yourself to the individuals.
[2:06:14] I like to know throughout this
[2:06:16] congregation while our heads are bowed
[2:06:19] [Music]
[2:06:21] who
[2:06:23] within their own within the honesty of
[2:06:25] their own heart.
[2:06:27] Brother Ed, I do not have
[2:06:30] I don't have what I heard spoke of this
[2:06:32] morning. I don't have that kind of
[2:06:34] revelation
[2:06:36] and I do need it. I realize that I need
[2:06:38] it. I realize that my life will be
[2:06:41] stable
[2:06:43] if God just would so grant it. And I
[2:06:46] will take your counsel this morning. And
[2:06:48] I will give myself unreservedly.
[2:06:51] I will seek this as life's great
[2:06:53] treasure.
[2:06:57] In Jesus Christ's name,
[2:07:02] whoever you are that may want to stand
[2:07:04] and I'm going to have prayer together
[2:07:06] with you.
[2:07:09] We'll sing again. In the presence of
[2:07:11] Jehovah. Can we do that?
[2:07:14] In the presence
[2:07:21] of Jehovah,
[2:07:23] [Music]
[2:07:27] God Almighty,
[2:07:32] Prince of
[2:07:38] Trouble,
[2:07:40] [Music]
[2:07:45] Christ.
[2:07:47] [Music]
[2:08:02] The more that I surrender,
[2:08:08] the more that I surrender
[2:08:16] to my Lord,
[2:08:21] the more that I
[2:08:27] the more you take control.
[2:08:33] The more that I
[2:08:36] humble myself,
[2:08:39] the more he me.
[2:08:47] [Music]
[2:08:55] We're going to sing it again, but I
[2:08:58] I'm taking some direction
[2:09:01] from God's prophet this morning as I
[2:09:04] listen coming to the service and how he
[2:09:07] instructed the ministers and how he
[2:09:09] instructed the people.
[2:09:11] And I'd like to say to you that are
[2:09:13] seated, these that are standing
[2:09:17] have stood because they've been moved
[2:09:19] from something within them.
[2:09:21] You that are seated, as you
[2:09:25] see these that are standing and know
[2:09:27] that in their heart something is
[2:09:30] throbbing,
[2:09:32] a hunger, a craving,
[2:09:34] a desire.
[2:09:36] Oh God,
[2:09:38] turn the light on within.
[2:09:41] I would ask everyone that is seated that
[2:09:44] you would enter into prayer for these
[2:09:47] that are hungering. Oh God, would you
[2:09:50] please meet with them? Maybe somebody
[2:09:53] near you that you even want to lay your
[2:09:55] hand on and pray with them. Oh God,
[2:09:58] there may be a father or mother near
[2:10:00] their a young person or a young person
[2:10:03] near a mother and father. Not everybody
[2:10:05] automatically has this revelation, but
[2:10:08] may it be something divinely given at
[2:10:12] this time. And in this service, friends,
[2:10:15] I don't want to wait for another
[2:10:16] service. I want it I want to see it take
[2:10:19] place now in the lives of those that are
[2:10:22] so thirsting and so hungering. We all
[2:10:25] want to enter into prayer for them.
[2:10:27] We're going to sing this chorus. The
[2:10:29] more that I surrender once again and
[2:10:31] then we're going to pray together.
[2:10:37] The more I surrender,
[2:10:42] [Music]
[2:10:43] the
[2:10:46] I
[2:10:48] [Music]
[2:10:52] release my tears,
[2:10:55] the more you take control,
[2:11:01] Lord, that I can humble myself.
[2:11:06] The more you lift me up
[2:11:11] every day,
[2:11:14] [Music]
[2:11:22] my Lord Jesus,
[2:11:24] how real you are.
[2:11:28] And I just go back in my own life now.
[2:11:32] I see various stations at various times
[2:11:36] when I was moved.
[2:11:38] I responded to the preaching of your
[2:11:40] word
[2:11:42] and I saw that you would back it up.
[2:11:45] Lord, these that have stood here this
[2:11:48] morning and I asked you expressly
[2:11:52] that you would you would speak your
[2:11:54] thoughts to the people and I take oh God
[2:11:58] I believe that it is the result of that
[2:12:03] you conveying your thoughts you've
[2:12:05] spoken it and brought it down into the
[2:12:07] hearts into that inner region of the
[2:12:11] people and they are believing it and
[2:12:13] receiving it and out
[2:12:15] out of honesty and insincerity,
[2:12:18] they're now standing, "Oh, God." They're
[2:12:21] standing with something beating in their
[2:12:23] heart, saying, "Oh Lord God, I believe
[2:12:28] what I've heard this morning, and I have
[2:12:31] stood to declare that I have not
[2:12:33] received the kind of revelation that I
[2:12:36] do have need of. I pray that you will
[2:12:40] send it down. Send it into me, Lord. and
[2:12:45] move out every doubt and every question
[2:12:48] that might be in my mind and in my
[2:12:50] heart. Oh God, move it out of the way.
[2:12:54] Come, sweet spirit. Come and take
[2:12:57] control. Come and take up your abode.
[2:13:00] Fill every room. Fill every part of my
[2:13:03] heart, oh God. And as the others pray
[2:13:06] for me, Lord, but I pray for myself. Oh
[2:13:09] God, I will never be moved from this
[2:13:12] direction. I've set my course this
[2:13:15] morning. I will seek, as your messenger
[2:13:17] has said, that revelation from you,
[2:13:20] Lord, for I certainly certainly desire.
[2:13:25] I want to have the revelation of the
[2:13:27] message
[2:13:29] and of the rapture and of those things
[2:13:32] that pertain to my moment, my time, and
[2:13:36] my life.
[2:13:38] Oh God,
[2:13:40] if I ask, you have said you will give
[2:13:43] it. I ask in faith and I believe that
[2:13:48] you will give it to me. I thank you for
[2:13:51] it now. Now I want all that stood asking
[2:13:56] you begin to thank him. Please, would
[2:13:58] you do that? You thank him for it. Don't
[2:14:01] hold your silence now. If you know that
[2:14:04] he's promised to give it to you, then
[2:14:06] the secret is you begin to thank him for
[2:14:08] it. Oh, we thank you, Lord. There may be
[2:14:12] some that are in need of healing. You
[2:14:14] need a revelation concerning the Lord
[2:14:17] that is your healer. Why don't you stand
[2:14:19] to your feet and receive that in the
[2:14:22] name of Jesus Christ? The same God that
[2:14:25] moved into the tomb and brought forth
[2:14:28] the body of our Lord Jesus Christ again.
[2:14:31] It stands here in this building and is
[2:14:33] moving throughout this audience. Oh God.
[2:14:37] Oh God that we shall see and give
[2:14:40] witness to that supernatural mighty acts
[2:14:43] of the Holy Spirit. We thank you for it.
[2:14:46] How many need of the Holy Ghost? You
[2:14:49] need you've not received the baptism.
[2:14:51] stand to your feet and receive it and
[2:14:54] say, "Lord, I receive it according to
[2:14:57] your promise.
[2:15:00] Thank you, Lord.
[2:15:03] Thank you, Lord.
[2:15:05] I give you thanksgiving, Lord, for all
[2:15:07] that you've done.
[2:15:10] All you've done for myself, all you've
[2:15:12] done, oh God,
[2:15:14] for this congregation. I give you
[2:15:16] thanksgiving.
[2:15:18] I thank you, Lord, that you've allowed
[2:15:19] us to be a lighthouse for this word.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Let it be a stronger message, oh God.
[2:15:25] Yet,
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; whatever it might bring, whether it
[2:15:28] brings reproach,
[2:15:31] oh God,
[2:15:33] we'll not we'll not avoid it. We'll not
[2:15:36] run away from it. We're here, oh Lord,
[2:15:39] to do your will and to do your bidding.
[2:15:43] Praise your name. Let everyone stand,
[2:15:45] shall we, please?
[2:15:58] Thank you, Father.
[2:16:00] [Music]
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus revealed in me Christ, the
[2:16:14] transforming power.
[2:16:23] Christ the transforming power. The words
[2:16:26] of this are marvelous.
[2:16:30] Everyone, if you would please,
[2:16:33] everything that's in you, give yourself
[2:16:34] now in this direction.
[2:16:37] Christ the transforming
[2:16:40] light
[2:16:45] touches
[2:16:46] This mark
[2:16:48] of light,
[2:16:52] piercing
[2:16:54] the darkest
[2:16:56] night,
[2:16:58] [Music]
[2:17:00] making his glory
[2:17:04] shine.
[2:17:08] Oh, to reflect
[2:17:11] his praise.
[2:17:14] [Music]
[2:17:16] causing the world to see.
[2:17:23] Love that will grow
[2:17:27] till others shall know
[2:17:32] Jesus reveal
[2:17:35] in me. I'd like to have that verse. Life
[2:17:39] is no longer mine.
[2:17:42] [Music]
[2:17:49] Sing it with all your heart now.
[2:17:58] [Music]
[2:18:07] until I
[2:18:11] see
[2:18:13] [Music]
[2:18:15] all
[2:18:19] [Applause]
[2:18:21] [Music]
[2:18:24] the world to see.
[2:18:32] will go till I shall go
[2:18:38] [Music]
[2:18:42] in.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; Rather than say a prayer,
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; I'll have you sing the prayer
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; and the prayer will be the words we just
[2:18:54] sang.
[2:18:55] Life is no longer mine.
[2:18:58] [Music]
[2:19:00] Will you sing that prayer
[2:19:02] [Music]
[2:19:05] from the very depths of your soul?
[2:19:10] Say it to him. You say it to him. Lord,
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; I give it all to thee.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; This is our prayer.
[2:19:25] Life is no longer
[2:19:29] mind.
[2:19:30] [Music]
[2:19:33] I give it all
[2:19:36] to thee.
[2:19:39] [Music]
[2:19:41] Fill me
[2:19:44] [Music]
[2:19:49] until
[2:19:50] my face.
[2:19:57] Oh,
[2:19:59] you reflect
[2:20:01] his grace,
[2:20:05] causing the world to sing.
[2:20:15] will go
[2:20:17] till
[2:20:19] [Applause]
[2:20:22] Jesus reveal
[2:20:26] me.
[2:20:28] [Music]
[2:20:32] You have prayed
[2:20:34] and I say in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:20:38] Christ, may it be so. God grant it to
[2:20:42] you in this presence and in this
[2:20:45] atmosphere. I dismiss you.
[2:20:48] I would say
[2:20:50] do everything you can to remain in this
[2:20:53] presence,
[2:20:55] remain in this atmosphere
[2:20:57] and just keep moving in that one
[2:20:59] direction of surrender to it. Would you
[2:21:01] do that?
[2:21:01] [Music]
[2:21:04] How many were here Wednesday night and
[2:21:05] heard our brother Murphy?
[2:21:08] Wonderful.
[2:21:11] How many really believe it was the Holy
[2:21:13] Spirit speaking to us?
[2:21:16] Amen. I do too.
[2:21:19] [Music]
[2:21:21] Brother Murphy,
[2:21:25] which is translating the messages why
[2:21:27] you don't see them.
[2:21:30] And I'm saying this because we could
[2:21:33] talk about I'm going to dismiss you
[2:21:35] right now. We could talk about the
[2:21:37] saints of years ago in their deep
[2:21:39] consecrated life.
[2:21:44] But this is one man that's right amongst
[2:21:46] you.
[2:21:48] You've been moved and affected by his
[2:21:50] life. But I want you to know that I as
[2:21:54] his pastor, I have watched this
[2:21:58] develop.
[2:22:00] Say, how did how did he give himself to
[2:22:02] it? After a sermon on a Sunday morning,
[2:22:06] after sermon,
[2:22:07] [Music]
[2:22:09] I go into that room
[2:22:11] and he's on his face before God.
[2:22:15] Doesn't even look up when I come in the
[2:22:17] room.
[2:22:19] I've seen after Sunday evening I step in
[2:22:22] there
[2:22:23] and he's on his face
[2:22:27] and in the morning he's still there.
[2:22:31] Not once,
[2:22:35] more than once.
[2:22:37] [Music]
[2:22:38] That's where that kind of devotion is
[2:22:42] born.
[2:22:43] Doesn't come just raising your hand in a
[2:22:46] service. It comes by giving yourself and
[2:22:49] that is one thing our brother Murphy has
[2:22:52] learned perhaps even something of his
[2:22:55] culture but they given such devotion.
[2:22:59] I can say to you God perhaps may not
[2:23:02] call you to do exactly the same thing
[2:23:05] but he does call every one of us every
[2:23:07] man woman child in this building to give
[2:23:09] ourselves unreservedly. And when God
[2:23:12] speaks to you and deals with you give
[2:23:15] yourself. It's not something that
[2:23:16] happens in a few minutes and then we
[2:23:18] pass off of it. You go out of this
[2:23:20] building and you give yourself. You come
[2:23:22] back this evening and you've already
[2:23:23] given yourself. You're yielding. And
[2:23:25] when you feel that presence moving into
[2:23:27] the service, listen now, when you feel
[2:23:29] that presence moving into the service
[2:23:30] and you see, you know, there's a
[2:23:32] different atmosphere. Give yourself to
[2:23:33] it. Everybody throughout the whole
[2:23:35] congregation should give themselves to
[2:23:36] it. And I can tell you before God,
[2:23:38] you'll begin to see things happening
[2:23:40] right in the service, the supernatural
[2:23:42] taking place because the spirit of God
[2:23:45] has free course in the meeting. How many
[2:23:48] believe that?
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; I do too. God bless you. You're
[2:23:53] dismissed in Jesus Christ's name. We'll
[2:23:56] see you this evening and hear the word
[2:23:58] that God has laid on brother Tom Ray's
[2:24:00] heart. You're dismissed.
[2:24:04] [Music]
