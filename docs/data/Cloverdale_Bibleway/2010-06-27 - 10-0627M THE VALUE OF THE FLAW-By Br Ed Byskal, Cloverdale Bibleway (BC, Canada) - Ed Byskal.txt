TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and and but God knows and he he has received both to himself would you stand with me we not sing anymore so you'll be free before we read the scripture uh I want to read out of Isaiah 53 but I'd like to have you bow your head with me heavenly father I sense and feel such a strange and wonderful presence it is your presence you have moved close Lord you are moving within my heart and I know the hearts of the people there is a a sacred there's a sacredness there's a quietness I believe you've been pleased with the worship oh God as the people began to sing about their Blessed assurance and then as the ch children sang oh God songs of the Saints of Ages past songs that are as as alive this morning as they were when they were first inspired by the Holy Ghost I pray father that you will bless the uh congregation that is here and those that may be streaming and that are streaming so wherever they are on this planet Earth I pray that the same spirit will penetrate the whole homes and the hearts and the rooms oh God wherever it might be taking place I pray that the same blessing of God will come upon them fill I pray Lord everyone every vessel fill us to overflowing may your word become so quickened may things be spoken today that will never be forgotten I pray that you will brand our hearts brand our minds Lord and prepare us even for the service this evening as our brother Tom will be ministering I ask oh God you'll receive us as we present ourselves to you as living sacrifices in the name of our blessed beloved Lord Jesus Christ amen amen if you'd open your Bibles time has slipped away on us but I I have a very unusual message on my heart and I would like to have just as little movement as possible and if you just give me your full and undivided attention in Isaiah 53 I'm going to read only five verses starting with verse one who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he hath no form nor cess and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him Isaiah the prophet is prophesying of our Lord Jesus Christ of course he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it we our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken uh smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed God bless his word as you have your seats one of the most striking statements that I've pondered so much that brother Branham has spoken uh when he preached the Masterpiece message he said concerning uh Michelangelo and his uh his statue or his uh work artwork of Moses and he said he struck it and he made a flaw on it he said in it and it made a flaw on it it put a flaw on the image he said to me the flaw was what made it the Masterpiece that takes a great deal of thought that's a very deep statement that the flaw made the Masterpiece I want to speak to you with God's help on the value of the flaw a flaw is to do physical harm to impair to deface or def figure disfigure perhaps to blemish that's a mar but a flaw is a defect it's a fault it's an imperfection it can be a physical disfigurement that prevents something from being totally perfect and distracts from its value that's what we know as being a flaw or a mar something's marred Michelangelo he marred his uh his great statue which he had made I was very moved as brother Ryan opened the service with a Blessed Assurance because this is the first thing I was going to show you I want to show you the author of uh that song would you give me the first one that there could we dim the lights a we bit also please uh the scripture was written and I will I will bring the Blind by a way that they knew knew not I will lead them in paths that they have not known I will make Darkness light before them and crooked things straight these things will I do unto them and not forsake them we have here a couple pictures of Fanny Crosby brother Brown referred to her many times born in 1820 and died in 1915 about her blindness she said it seems seemed intended it seemed intended by the Blessed Providence of God that I should be blind all my life and I thank him for the the dispensation if perfect Earthly sight were offered me to tomorrow I would not accept it I might not have sung hymns to the praise of God if I had been distracted by the Beautiful and interesting things about me she was asked by uh and spoken to by a a minister and who said to her it's it's it's really sad that uh you haven't got your sight such a gifted intelligent person perhaps you would have uh been been able to express so many other things and she quickly responded that if I were offered sight right now I would refuse it because she said the first thing I want to see is the face of my savior and she wrote the song I shall know him I shall know him by the prince of the nails in his hands I can say that she certainly had a flaw in life but she used it for the glory of God she didn't wallow in in it she didn't wallow in the ground she didn't allow her life to become a burden to others she rather she gave glory to God and has blessed centuries of people wrote over 8,000 songs when Fanny died her tombstone carried the words Aunt Fanny and Blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of Glory Divine I say that she indeed increased the value of the law she could have just been blind but she increased the value she accepted it she in increased the value of it and we may not have that kind of extreme uh example of a flaw in our lives but I'm I want you to sit close and sit quiet I'm going to come home to your address and God has laid this I have never spoken such a subject but it is forever who whoever is here you may have thought you came as a visitor this is for you you say I well I come here all the time I'm a member here this is for you you may be streaming and you say uh well I'm I'm streaming and I always stream but I want you to listen to this service differently this is for you I won't take the time to to read the beautiful beautiful poem that was read at her funeral but it just started out by saying way to the country of sunshine and song our Songbird has taken her flight and she who has sung in the darkest so long now sings in the beautiful light brother brandham said about her the reason I respect blind Fanny Crosby she never sold her gift out to the world she kept it with God my old blind Fanny Crosby had never seen in her life but she screamed pass me not oh gentle savior hear my humble cry while on others Thou Art calling do not pass me by Moses had a flaw the prophet said that all the prophet had flaws and we all have flaws he spoke about Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and Joseph you can turn the lights back on now if you would please being the foundation corners of the great rock that the new masterpiece Jesus Christ would be built on and he said Joseph's life was perfect but he said he had a scratch there was just a scratch and the scratch was he said to his parents his father rather and his brothers when you come do not into Egypt do not say that you're that you're Shepherds because that's a uh that's looked down on so say something that you're herders or that you're herdsmen or something but you're not Shepherds but when they came and his father came and Pharaoh asked them what are you he said we're Shepherds he said that was a scratch even in Joseph's life uh and you may sit in life you may be sitting here today and saying everything's going fine and everything's wonderful and and young people whose lives are perhaps Carefree well let me just say this that you don't live very long before you feel a scratch and my message today really has and I feel a real urgency and I feel stirred a message thrusting through me that it's it's what you do with the flaw amen what you do with it and there are different ways that it comes sometimes times it can be uh something direct that God actually does for example uh the the this masterpiece message actually has its commencement with with Adam being in the image of God and God directly wounded him and took Eve from him and that was the Mar in in in Adam but it it had to have that in order to achieve a bride and a wife for him and Christ was marred and at at Calvary that the Bride of Jesus Christ would have a life amen but Moses he had a flaw sometimes it can be something not that God does directly but something that God allows he may allow it a very very bad thing can happen very evil in your from your perspective can happen but maybe but God often allows it to happen and then we can ask why has God allowed this to happen there is a positive spin to it and if you're not careful you'll take the negative side because Satan is inspiring the negative side and he wants you to think about the negative part of it and the negative part of it can make a person embittered can make them angry can put a very negative twist in their life and and and rench them out inside and they live a life far below where they should as a son and daughter of God and then there's a third one and that is self-inflicted we do things and we are so filled with regret and remorse and repentance and and on and on remember you must deal with those things according to the scripture if you do wrong you repent you you you you must deal with the flaw you must deal with that self-inflicted wound so that God even can take it and and use you as a result of it this is what I'm going to be speaking about and I know we all have it and furthermore I want you to I want you to take and absorb this service this morning and apply it into that area of your life and if you can't apply it as of right now probably next week or next month or who who knows when you will be able to apply it the Bible says of Moses when God begin to speak to him and Moses said to the Lord my oh my Lord I am not eloquent neither here to for not since thou Hast spoken unto thy servant but I am of slow speech I want you to hear this I'm going to dwell on that a moment I'm of slow speech spe and of a slow tongue and the Lord said who's made the mouth who's made the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind have not I the Lord and the slow the word in the Hebrew is to be of heavy to be weighty words to be Grievous words difficult and burdensome and even very oppressive he wasn't eloquent he didn't know how to say it he just said it straight out and straightforward and and perhaps his his language was burdensome and it came across oppressive do you know what so multitude say concerning the prophet's message it's so judgmental it's so hard he's always stripping us down I'll give you two signs like Moses but maybe he also that's why brother Bram said I'm not educated I can't preach like these men can preach I I don't have the education it was a burden to him but it did not prevent him from saying thus says the Lord it did not prevent him from receiving and hearing the word of God for you for this generation and he never rided himself of that flaw with his H and his K and all the all the grammar of the self he still remembered a still remained a seventh grade educated boy from Kentucky who didn't have any friends he also carried all through his life because I was with him when he was 52 and 53 one day he just turned to me quickly because his daddy was an alcoholic his daddy was a uh a boot leer and produced liquor and brother was actually carrying the water from the for the still when the wind came into the trees and he heard the voice speaking to him but he had that flaw all his life and his parents were Catholics and as I said to brother Eugene and sister Gina he said I didn't have a religious home perhaps if I had I'd been further down the road and more souls may have been saved Hallelujah yeah he had a flaw and he carried it all his life he said to me one day quickly he said brother Eddie my daddy was a alcoholic but he said if you ask me right now we were standing in the motel room he said if you ask me right now if there was gold bricks stacked from the floor to the ceiling of this room he said if you ask me what I would pre sooner have that pile of gold bricks or 5 minutes with my daddy he said I'd take the five minutes with my daddy so it was worth hundreds of millions of dollars for him to be able to have five minutes with his daddy I say that's a person that made the best of the flaw and had his daddy die in his arms and was able to pray for for him and pray with him and see his mother converted he took a flaw of a Catholic Family and turned the thing around nothing is impossible with [Applause] [Music] God I thought of David I just added this this morning it was in my mind cuz I can see it all through the scripture but I'm just wondering which one I should pick and I thought of David and it's described in in Samuel and he wanted to build a house for the Lord and he wanted to do so many things and he had it in his heart and God sent Nathan and spoke to him this is after he had taken Uriah taking uriah's wife bath Sheba he said wherefore hast thou despised the Commandment of the Lord to do evil in his sight thou has killed Uriah the hittite with the sword and has taken his wife to be thy wife and has slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou Hast despised me and has taken the wife of UAH the hittite to be the thy wife thus sayith the Lord behold I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and I will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this son for thou did it secretly but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the son you might say this would be a hopeless situation he took and had had a man killed so that he could have his wife and he needed to do so because she was already carrying David's child and God said he'll he'll die you talk about a flaw you talk about a a AAR in a person's life but God never took away the fact that he would still be king God never took away from him that his his praises and and and and God saw what he would do with the flaw he accepted it he accepted God's sentence and he said in the Psalms where his worshiping let my sentence come from your presence don't let it come from some man or a group of men but let my sentence whatever it is let it come from your presence and God so loved him and he took his flaw and wrote some of the most glorious verses in the scripture and prophesied of Jesus Christ and reflected Jesus Christ in his life and don't ask me how where or how this happens and through that woman B she becomes Solomon God even allowed because God knew what he would do with that flaw he accepted it he didn't get bitter against God he didn't question God he received it it's not whatever will be will be no it is taking it and and and putting it in a in a in a different uh you put it in a different environment and say I accept the sentence of God I accept the word of God I accept the Forgiveness of God I accept it and I will give my life as a sacrifice to God and let him do whatever he wishes with me the tell the scripture tells us in in the book of Acts when the apostles were filled with the Holy Ghost and when they heard these things they were cut to the heart I'm going to be going back and forth but you'll follow the theme they were cut to the heart and they nashed on him with their teeth and that was after a a 30 second message that Peter gave also when they heard when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them Peter had preached and I counted it I read it myself like preaching and it is no more not even quite a 30 second sermon and I thought I should read that sermon but I won't even take the 30 seconds but you know who was sitting there was gel the the instructor and teacher of apostle Paul was sitting listening to this 302 message and when they said let's slay these people gel stood up after hearing a 30-second message and he said let it let us not do this kind of thing we can't fight God and he turned and his his speaking convinced the people to turn away from killing these men but why did they arise with such a an anger why did they have to spill out so much evil upon them because they were cut to the heart it was the truth that cut them to the heart these were like the words of Moses coming heavy and Grievous and oppressive we don't want to hear these things we don't want to hear we can't cut our hair we don't want to hear how we ought to dress we don't want to hear how we should live and what we should see in our homes and the kind of material we don't want to hear that this is too oppressive it's thus say the word and we receive those Grievous words and say this is God speaking I need this and I will benefit as I I receive it it was a burden to the apostles to have to speak that way brother brandham had to say I don't I don't hate the sisters we love them I'm trying to help them but it was a burden in his life and he was identified as a woman hater right he was identified as being all kinds of things and the message is still identified that way and you can accept that rather than trying to smooth it out Apostle Paul's great teacher he was a ected by that 302nd sermon and talk those religious leaders out of killing the apostles and when when the scripture says in the Greek they were cut to the heart it was that they were just like sa a Sunder to be swn through mentally and and and to be to be ranked and torn with vexation this wasn't something light friends right this was something that were having an incredible effect upon people people but the apostles it is like they were looked upon as having a mar having uh that they were identified as being ignorant men raw to the point saying it they couldn't put the message in a in a nice framework is had to tell it the way it was amen we still need it and then when Jesus was speaking he said many therefore of his disciples these were believers who had professed to believe on him they were in church he said many therefore of his disciples when they heard this saying or rather heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it brother brandham says in Jehovah Gyra the trouble of it is we have got so much Hollywood preaching and not enough oldtime rough preaching I like the oldtime kind that really tears the he offer you brings it down to a place where it belongs too much petting around we need the oldfashioned gospel preached in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus that's what the world needs today how many here can say Amen to that Hallelujah but for saying those things he was despised it is Jesus Christ that's still being despised and rejected he said God doesn't need compromisers God doesn't want his church to look like the world he doesn't want it to act like the world he doesn't want it to have anything to do with the world only to preach the gospel to the world and to call those forth God wants separators amen the church wants mixers they want a pastor who will not be so hard on them and tell them good things and not dig right down just rake the hide off of them brother that's what we need and in this day this is the thing we have to be so concerned about because everything around us our entire environment and the prophet said that the pressure of this great age is soft living it can be dangerous am amen so if you have it use it for God's kingdom amen whatever it might be I say soft living is a flaw on this generation soft living is disfiguring this generation and I believe whatever generation we are raised in we can take that and use it for the glory of God you got a home use it for God's glory use it for Hospitality you got a car use it when believe Bel have need whatever it is use it for the glory of God be faithful to the house of God be faithful with your testimony so I say once again repeating there are different aspects of wounding or to Mar or to cause a flaw I remind you again some are allowed by God and some are brought Upon Us by other people or circumstances and some are self-inflicted some are the results of nature Fanny Crosby born blind I looked at others there were great people I won't even talk about them Einstein couldn't hardly write much of his life very intelligent people Steven Hawking I saw him here in Vancouver trying to speak through his computer uh dying with lugar's disease as it were and yet one of the most Brilliant Minds if you saw his twisted up just such a hopeless helpless sight twisted up being wheeled in a wheelchair and and and with this motorized chair I should say and and speaking one word and then another word and another word and taking questions from the taking questions from the people several hundreds of people are there and yet the eyes of the world are on him because he has the most brilliant mind I guess since Einstein I would say that not for Christ necessarily I don't know what his belief is but he has not allowed that Dreadful flaw and disfigurement in his life to hinder him from what was driving inside listen to me friends we have something inside if we're a Believer you have Christ inside and now we need to listen to the inner mind and let the Inner Man motivate us and drive [Applause] us Amen to be a tool and a vessel for the kingdom not for this world don't serve this world it's all passing away serve it to live serve it to provide for your family serve it to pay your bills and do what you ever need to do but don't sacrifice the House of God don't sacrifice your spiritual life before Christ amen Jesus said as he was coming to the Maring as he was coming now to be so brutalized that his Visage would be marred more than that of any man can you believe that brother brandom describes it and I tell you you want to have a strong stomach but he said no man taketh speaking of his life taketh it from me but I lay it down with myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again and this commandment I have received of my father the scripture says God gave his son Jesus La his own life down and yet men crucified him so this is one where God and even brother brandham says God smote him but actually in human form it was men that smot him but God was allowing them to Smite him God was allowing man to make the mar but God was actually responsible for the mar God gave his son now hold it close men thrust the thorns on his brow men drove the nails in his feet and hands but God gave him to be the sacrifice so God arranged it and this flaw this Mar was not something that Jesus ran from he ran to it he'd be despised of men and considered Smitten by God but out of the flaw yes sir came a voice out of the flaw came the blood that speaks better things than that of AEL and the prophet he dwells on it so much that when Michelangelo was finished with his his statue and His image of of Moses he said it was so perfect when he saw the image that he had in his mind and he said he worked for years and he labored for years and spent such a large part of his life and he saw it in his mind and all it was was a a block it was just a a piece of stone but in the stone he saw an image he saw Moses in the stone and when he finally had it done and had it polished and and touched up here and there and and and and he thought that it was so real it must speak and he took his hammer and struck the knee and said speak and brother Benham ties that over to Calvary when he finally saw an image here on Earth hallelujah oh stay with me now please when he saw the image here on Earth he he he he he didn't only desire a son he desired a family he desired a relationship that would be that of husband and wife and you that have not experienced husband and wife relationship let me tell you the relationship that the Lord Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost will take you into will supersede the husband wife human relationship it can supersede it yes do you believe that not just because I'm preaching it but if you can say that it supersedes it amen God was looking up beyond the physical frame he was looking beyond the physical when he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased but when he led and he led that son the the the the dove leading the lamb and led him up to Calvary and beaten and and blooded and finally he comes to Calvary and men who are breathing God's air who have ate God's food who God gives strength in their muscles and they're the ones with the hammer and drove the spikes and the one that took the spear and thrust his side I've said it before and perhaps you can't understand it he did us a favor even the cruel Roman soldier did us a favor when he thrusted his side and out came blood and water but the prophet said of King Spirit the only spirit that can mingle with your spirit for the first time in history and the last time in history that's right came out a spirit out of a broken blood cell he said the blood cell was broken and only that Spirit could come into your spirit Hallelujah and make you a new creature in Christ Jesus Hallelujah but the prophet said you'll still have the sticky nature and that's what I want to deal with as I go along you'll still have the sticky nature I say you might as well accept it there's people who spend their entire life trying to get rid of it trying to get rid of it I'm not talking about sinful things I'm talking about the the sticky nature right right God knew you'd be born in a natural birth God knew every footstep that you take and some of you come from good homes and some come from very dysfunctional homes and some come from very sad situations and it's fine for me to go back back in the Bible and I've given some of my own testimony brother brandham often told his life story and he told it in minute detail sister Debbie Kye I spoke to your husband years ago sister Debbie as many years ago I couldn't even recall all the details I won't go into all the details but her and her sister there was a number of children I think another four maybe about six children in a home with an alcoholic mother and alcoholic father father and the children are put out into foster homes and the whole family is essentially dis abandoned and she talked with me and said I I want to make contact with my family and we've been separated all these years and certain members of the family and and she was so burdened I could see she was just so crushed now that sister sits here I'm not talking about 3,000 years ago 4,000 years ago and every one of you here have something that you're carrying and you wish it could be different and I'm going to say take the situation where you are and where you find yourself and say God I give it to you I will not surrender up any of my spiritual Christian standards or walk let my sentence come from your presence but I will I give it to you I will not let it intimidate me I will not let it stand in my way I give it to you whatever that thing is whatever whatever arrangement I came out of and I saw that sister Debbie was so burdened and crushed over this and and when do you think it goes away it doesn't go away you think about it at night you think about it when you lay down in bed you think about it while you're working while you're busy while you're active while you're doing things you're thinking about it it's always there because it's you not talking about what's in your nature I'm talking about circumstances and the circumstances may be those that you didn't were were imposed upon you there may be others that were self-inflicted choice that you made uh we have David's case we have other cases in the scripture which it was not the people's fault they were birthed into it wasn't sister Debbie's fault mother and father are both alcoholics she had nothing to do with the fact that they went out to foster homes different foster homes and she doesn't have contact and now she comes into the message and she wishes that they they can hear the same gospel she hears to make a long story short and I won't go into it just a year or so ago I was able to meet sister Debbie her sister older sister and her husband and both have come into the message I want to pass a bouquet to brother Mike and sister Debbie and it never has entered my mind it has never come my mind but as I was studying and I put it down and Debbie your your name came up and then I pushed it away and then it came up again I pushed it away and it came up and so I felt I have to say something and then it seemed that the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said she took a flaw she took a mar she took the burden uh oppressive condition from her life but didn't let it affect her spiritual walk and her service to God and God has brought now the older sister and her husband and it just seemed like the holy spirit said to me they they SST say that the world is a that the universe is expanding and for the first time I thought maybe that is right because as people are birthed into the family of God he throws another world out there or another 10,000 worlds and I said God bless you Sister Debbie 20,000 planets went into space when they went into into God's Kingdom Hallelujah why not the prophet said one soul is worth 10,000 worlds that's not some poetic language that's the truth I'm here today to declare you live your life for God regardless of your past or regardless of what you suffered or regardless of your situation don't let Satan poke anything down that memory Channel amen amen [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah if I was standing here now I'm bringing it home and you knew me to have slept with a woman and that she bore a child as a result of it and God killed that child I don't think you would want me to be a pastor I don't think you'd want to hear me speak because your eyes would be on the floor and David could have just kept in looking at the flaw as well and saying look what's happened to my life I I've ruined it I'm I I I'm good for nothing God still saw him as one of the the greatest Kings of the Bible and he wouldn't change it I'm not suggesting that I have committed such a sin I can in fact say I've been I've been true and I've lived a clean pristine life and the only woman I've known is my wife I say that for the glory of God but let me say this this might not be the testimony of other people but I am no purer than you and you're and and brother brandham is no purer than anybody the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses and Braes every transgression so to you that may have self-inflicted wounds let me tell you that the that the Christ of this gospel erases and the prophet furthermore says that when your confessed sin drops into the blach he said it actually becomes BL that's beyond our compr hension and then there are others that are imposed upon you it wasn't sister Debbie that chose my parents should be alcoholics it wasn't you that chose that your situation would be what it is some of your single parents it wasn't you that chose your husband or wife would depart you and leave you it wasn't you that chose certain things would be a certain way I'm saying if the reason why God hear me good now the reason why God so loved David it was because God could set his sentence on his act and David would accept it but he would say this will not hinder me I will not let this impair my love for God hallelujah I will not let it stand in my way and that was so complete that God allowed and predetermined that B Sheba would bring forth Solomon who was a type of Jesus Christ and under Solomon he the prophet said Israel essentially had a millennium amen that kind of God we don't know very much about that's right yes in case anybody thinks you don't have a flaw yeah don't don't be too self assured for when the scratch comes when the flaw comes how I thank God for clean lives and how I thank God for lives that haven't like brother BR said I might have been further down the road I just want to say I don't care what has happened in your life I don't care where you came came from the God that I serve and the god that is present here today knows precisely your situation he knows what has caused it what has created it he has watched you every step you've taken and he is saying right here this morning through my lips that you turn your life you give what you have to him that's all he wants he's not wanting a bunch of bunch of Works he doesn't need a bunch of things so you he can justify you he just wants you to surrender your life the talents that he's given you the gifts that he's given you just turn them back to God whatever you do don't be reduced to a [Applause] churchgoer whatever you do don't merely become religious whatever you do are you hearing me don't turn this message into a tradition oh now we're so happy we're Believers that we just live nice little lives and go to church and so on don't do that say Here I Am Speak Lord what do you want me to do what do you want me to be and don't forget this message amen amen flaws and then in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was hewed out and reflected what the word was at the beginning himy the word reflected in the Masterpiece in his own likeness God back again in his own likeness the word form being reflected in the image of a man the Masterpiece and he said all prophets had flaws now I'm kind of jumping all over but you foret forgive me I'm just so moved I'm having a hard time delivering this to you I've talked a lot of you and I know the burdens you bear you surrender it up to God right the scripture says that when God saw Jesus the Father the word now in flesh and a voice spoke this is my son in whom I'm pleased and on Mount Transfiguration a cloud covered him and a voice this is my son hear ye him amen but the prophet I'm so thankful for the message the prophet said that when uh when Michelangelo and he's he's bringing it right up to the present time when he saw the sun when he saw his image and when God saw his image because say there was something he saw on Calvary that he didn't see while Jesus was walking and coming out of the water he saw something on Calvary and the prophet is bringing to it so clear and he takes a hammer and now God is allowing it and struck the image and when the image was struck the blood cell of God the the the beginning of the new creation please grasp this the image the beginning of the new creation the blood cell that had been in the womb of Mary Hallelujah which was a creation of God the beginning of a new creation the blood cell broke and God saw his family God saw you I can prove it to you hallah he asked through he asked through Isaiah where's my family where's my household that you build to me in other words where's my family where's my household the heavens my hand is made the Earth is my foot stol but where's the house that you build me not a building not Cedar not Stones where's the house you look at in the Hebrew where's my household where's my children where's my sons where's my wife where's my household where's this kind of relationship God doesn't need gold he doesn't need silver he doesn't need your offering he doesn't need your tithe he doesn't need anything he just wants you he wants that Spirit that's in you that his the life from his blood cell came and mingled with your spirit and made you a son and daughter of God and that life is so powerful it can control the sticky [Music] nature hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I've got something you've got something greater than your sticky nature amen hallelujah yes sir he said he got so inspired and I just as though I could see God the almighty one all his Focus now is on what's happening on on this Hill Called Mount Calvary go gotha and when he sees and and finding that sun is so battered he saw Isaiah and what he spoke to Isaiah it's all been past all been fulfilled he sees it right before him a lamb a bleeding lamb and it's so perfect because he knows this is the answer and he struck it and Out Come the blood and the spirit the blood went to the earth and the spirit ascended it's a spirit of God to come back into the believer that's why we speak so forcefully on the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall connect the word and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's not some manly hands on you and making you to utter some words that's not it it's him who said you be baptized and you shall be filled with the Holy [Applause] [Music] Ghost and you'll have God living inside of a sticky nature and brother Bram was even asked the question when Apostle Paul said when I would do good evil is present with me and what I would do I do not the good that I would do I do not and the evil that I would not I do and a man ask a question and questions and answers he said this I don't understand brother Bram said well it's a cockabur with a wheat seed in [Applause] it Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah with wheat life in it but God got so inspired and the prophet kept saying it he struck it and cried speak Jesus didn't say anything but the blood spoke the blood cried out the price is paid the blood Cried Out Redemption is [Applause] complete the blood cried out here is the family here's the family of God and our Propet of God said you were there in him at Calvary do you believe that you were there call your name out say I was there on Calvary Hallelujah when the blood spoke out this is redemption not half not 90% this is redemption you never heard me say what I'm saying if I committed the sins of David you wouldn't want to be here your human reasoning just wouldn't quite allow it but you see you would be I'm ready coming down you would be looking at the flaw not at what you could do with it right and what David did with it he accepted the sentence of God you should read the psalms now after this service it was what he did with it if you focused with what he did with it then you'd understand you might say well we have the Holy Spirit now that's right but we have some of the same flaws we have some of the same weighty burdensome crushing oppressive Mars in our life I've been born this way I've been born in a certain country I've been born with a certain home I've had a mess of my life tell you what God's not looking at them mess he's looking at what he provided to fix it Hallelujah that's why I'm speaking today Jesus said furthermore I have come not those that are not sick they don't need a physician those that are righteous don't need Christ he said I have come I have come for those that are sick those that recognize I need a savior I need a total Redemption I need the life that came out I need the blood that speaks better things than able I need a voice that says you're forgiven I need a voice that [Applause] says lay your life down give me your heart God got so inspired Apostle Paul carried a flaw he even mentions it he said I stood when Timothy was being martyred and furthermore they laid his clothes at my feet and I stood there and I never said a word against it right first church age messenger if you look at his flaw you'll have a hard time seeing really what he achieved in his life and he said I blasphemed I was a blasphemer but I did it [Applause] ignorantly I didn't know any better that's not people I've heard things said about Believers and whatever you do with those that have found Fellowship elsewhere and going elsewhere be careful what you say about them leave it in the hands of God I've heard things and I said that's so close to blasphemy against the Holy Spirit on that they walk on such Dangerous Ground when we speak about one another we speak about how they've lived or what has happened to them I can tell you one thing a surrendered life God is looking at what you will do with thy flaw Moses said I can't speak God says I'll have you to speak furthermore I'll give my whole law to you you'll be the first prophet and I'll give your whole law and no man will speak with God like you're going to like I'm going to speak with you amen and he came down and was the mouthpiece by the Ernie of almighty God but it was course it was hard he was a slow laborious not slow in length of speaking he it was laborious and he just had to say it Thou shalt not K Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal and he just laid it out there and some of the people could handle it and some couldn't that's right that did not change his status with God your flaw Hallelujah I'm here to say your flaw whatever it might be does not change your call or your status with God can you say Amen to that why don't you say Thank you Lord Jesus [Music] Hallelujah and don't spend your life trying to get rid of it don't spend your life being bitter about it just say I am who I am and I give it to Christ I give it all to Christ brother brandham said I get up to preach you know I'm not a preacher with this my Kentucky grammar and the his and the haint and all those words I love it so I can't say this yes sir what we call a modern preacher today I couldn't take its place I couldn't take that place because I have no education came out of a meeting and there were children standing there and a little boy wanted his autograph said I can't even read my own writing how are they going to do it I'm giving you a little bit of a taste of what you think that he didn't labor under that his childhood despised and no one want to even walk on the same side of the street you think he didn't remember that yeah he remembered that cuz he told about it amen it was in mind yes and the brandom name and how it was turned down and he says now I got friends all over the world I have to run to hide then he said dear friends I'm not young like you all this morning but I'm old and I've been through many hard battles and by going through those hard battles brings you where you are this morning he said you see so I'm sure you understand that God has put me God has put me through it amen every person here needs to say that same thing God has put me through that true he said that and there is a reason that my life might open up a way and say this is it amen some of you maybe been hiding behind your flaw well you know I'm kind of sh this is my home or this is my family or this is my background and I'm kind of strange and the kids at school they kind of make fun and my family's kind of look down on for this reason or that reason or a whole multitude of reasons we kind of hide behind I say come out from behind that Bush come out from behind that excuse say I am what I am and I give it to the glory of God I'll believe the word I'll live according to the word but I give my life to God I will glorify him one way or another but Satan shall not rob is my opportunity in this life and I'll do what I can I'll do everything I can to live a life that is a credit to this gospel sticky old nature when I say sticky right away you think of something that clings and adher appears to you that's right it does I've been trying to get rid of it for 76 years excuse me 75 and I got to back that up a couple before I found out what I was like so for a lot of say get rid of that right you know then you get down and say oh God I just failed I'm such a failure I just I'm I think I'll just throw it in the towel and the devil is just standing there and say do it do it throw in the towel give up you wretch isn't that the truth you need to remember it's not the flaw it's not that old hindrance it's not that old sticky nature that I'm going to give whatever I am I'll let God deal with the sticky nature [Applause] amen now now I got a surprise for you you might be saying well thank goodness something's going to come out of this service you know what it's that weakness that inherent weakness it's that Frailty it's that thing that troubles you all the time that keeps driving you on and if you didn't have have it you wouldn't be driven on you wouldn't go to your knees and say oh God deliver me oh God forgive me oh God help me once more I'm so this has happened so many times but please just once more and that kind of motivation it's going to put you right into the Rapture that's the truth right into the Rapture and when you got on the other side you'll say thank God for the flaw if I didn't have the flaw if I hadn't got that Mar if I wasn't born that way I'd have just laps back hey there's a lot of people that got the same conditions and circumstances you and it doesn't bother they just they have another drink just smoke some pot and forget all about it it doesn't bother them but it bothers a son and daughter of God it bothers us hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah the Waring of the flesh the scripture says for the flesh lusteth or desires and Wars against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh I thank God for that one the flesh is lusting against that life it has all kinds of other desires but the spirit the spirit that came out of calvary the spirit that came out of Jesus is in you and that spirit is stronger than the sticky nature it's stronger than the [Applause] flaw your past the spirit that came out Satan's looking pointing at you pointing at you look at your past but the spirit has a voice and the spirit is saying you're forgiven the spirit is saying it's under the blood and I don't know if I can speak on behalf of God but I believe God saying amen amen that's why I was so inspired I saw them forgiven I saw them as my family I saw them as the Blood Washed hallelujah hallelujah no wonder he was inspired so I have this and I want to give it to you as a phrase the Waring of the flesh against the spirit just makes us more resolved more determined to sacrifice and lay our lives down for the cause of Jesus Christ he would like you to become affected and atrophied say well I because I'm this or because I'm that or because this happened to me because I guess I can't do anything you tell him he's a liar you can do lots for the kingdom I speak to every man woman and child here you can do lots for the kingdom and you must this is not an option amen for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after can I have a few more minutes though we walk in the flesh we do not war according to or after the flesh we do not War as our mind would tell us or as a human would be for the weapons of our Warfare are not cornal but Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds and Paul said in Romans who shall lay anything anything say that with me anything who shall lay anything against lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justify us it was God's blood cell that was broken at Calvary who is he that condemneth and even yourself you don't have a right to condemn what God has Justified [Applause] don't belittle Calvary don't give Satan any credit who is he that condem it is Christ that died ye rather that is risen who is even at the right hand of God who who also maketh intercession for us shall the flaw of tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness every one of those is a service within themselves an apostle Paul said who shall separate us from the from the love of Christ shall tribulation I'll say the flaw of tribulation amen none of us want tribulation but you got it you will have it sometime there will be a scratch no matter how blessed and perfect your life and home is that's right you may live the most pristine life look at the prophet of God absolutely Flawless life that's right but there was all kinds of things that have been said and continue to be said against him and against us who bear the message shall tribulation or distress you have distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or the flaw of peril or the flaw of the sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are a we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors Hallelujah and I want this congregation to repeat with Apostle Paul we are more than conquerors say it again we are more than conquerors through him that loved us and he demonstrated that love of Calvary when the spirit left him to come into you Hallelujah I'm going to stop now I'll just take these few minutes I wanted to speak on the inspiration of his vision maybe I'll take just a few moments to highlight it for we all that are here all that are streaming all that have been Blood Washed we are his workmanship amen created in Christ amen unto good works which God hath before ordained that we shall walk walk in them no wonder he got inspired no wonder God got inspired it wasn't the Romans or the Jews that killed him God became inspired God bruised him Hallelujah God bruised him to get you out to bring you to this time I hope I don't sound repetitious we his workmanship brother brandham says back Yonder and sometimes we don't let your mind become just uh like I've heard that before keep it in perspective with what I'm saying before the foundation of the world before he took this old sun and he moved it around this old star this Earth that we're living on now this Earth and he molded it over here by the Sun and laid it around the Sun and he molded it on this side and let her hang there for a hundred billion years what was he making some gases and he moved on around to this side and he made something else what was he making there some pot as and he moved around this way and what was he doing he was making some calcium what was he doing he was making you and me Hallelujah I just want to ask you something if God spent perhaps a few billion years to make this right here so that we could live right for 50 60 70 80 90 years and he did that for the calcium that he put in the earth and the petroleum and the pach and so on so we could live here and have a little expression do you think he weary with shaping that inside person and he molds he knows that flaws there he let you even be born with it he let you be born in such a kind of family he knew even those things that are self-inflicted he knew those things that we would do those sins or those things we would commit those things that we even ask forgiveness and Satan doesn't want you forget it because that that kind of thing is in the blood he doesn't want anything comes from the blood he'll be sure and resurrect everything keep it right fresh in your mind like it happened yesterday say I can't even see that God can't see it it's in the blood it's under the blood it's gone amen hallelujah and somebody you might say well you know how was it confessed or how did you confess it that's between you and God that's none of my business that's between you and God and then you just say with David say with David let your sentence come let my sentence come from your your presence I don't want to hear it from the church I don't want to hear it from a preacher I don't want to hear it from some good people I want my sense to come from you and if you if you've done it then you can prosper my life you can allow the Life of Christ to live in me I only desire here's my life Lord and let him do the rest and it's amazing how he'll start confirming it amen yes amen right forgive me a minister said to brother brandham in the Masterpiece he said why is it that you're always balling the people out those people believe you to be a servant of God to be gentle and sweet to them and everything said every time I hear you get up you're balling the women out about having short hair or about wearing shorts or wearing makeup and balling the people out and telling them how cool and formal and different they are said why do you do that he said how can you be he said how can you be a loving Son of God and do a thing like that and I said sir did did you ever read about the great composer Boven he said he probably tore up wasteful baskets waste baskets full of scrap paper but he gave the world a masterpiece you know where we are and what you see I've never said this before but but it came so powerful to my own heart we're living in a world this world is God's it's a waste basket it's full of crumpled paper of things that's not the plan of God when your flaw or or your past or whatever more was done there was a time that God crumbled up the paper and threw it in a waste basketall and he's going to this waist basket out it's going to be so thorough stay with me in my little language now it's going to be so thorough and so complete that he's even going to send a holy fire the prophet said and burn the heavens where the demon Spirits have lodged and come down to tempt you and to give you a a terrible life and those hordes of hell that have played on your mind I'm not preaching to somebody outside of this building I'm preaching to you here or you that are in the in the streaming congregation the hordes of hell that come and don't tell me they don't talk to you they talk to you like they talk to me and we have things that if you could do it over you'd go back and do it again forget it say I acknowledge the flaw I acknowledge a sticky nature it isn't that I just cave in say well that's the way I am I got a temp and I can't do anything about it it's not that the light that is in you is greater than that temper greater than that Temptation you don't but you may not ever get rid of you will never get rid of the Temptation and we got things that you know we each one have little quirks I guess I'm the only one praise the Lord not praise the Lord that we all have quirks but we do have and after speaking he said he probably tore up waste baskets full of scrap paper and he gave the world a masterpiece when he was sitting in his study under the inspiration notice under the inspiration God was so inspired he spoke this is my beloved Son there is none other this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell this is my beloved Son here ye him but on the cross when he saw that image that perfect son paying the price he struck him and said [Music] speak and he did speak I'm laboring on that he did speak and that blood is speaking now listen while I come to a close and he came he got under under inspiration and he writes something down and go into a study and pray it wasn't right he'd scrap it and throw it in the basket waist basket look at the Earth was filled with violence and men and women they just didn't even get married men took women and the Earth was filled with violence and it was filled with pleasure and God the Bible says God repented himself they even made the Earth what did he do he took it that first creation and crumbled it all up and throw this in the waste basket and all the time down through the centuries man even Israel they failed went into bondage corrupted themselves bowed down to images bowed down to false gods offered their children and bured them now that's something right true I've never been able to understand that burnt their own children and offered them to some false empty God I tell you that's deception that's deception but even then God would not give up on Israel I don't care what kind of a flaw you have I don't care how much bondage you've gone into I don't care what kind of sins you've committed you are the people of God and you will bring forth a [Applause] masterpiece do you hear me God's not going to give up on you you may give up on yourself God will not give up on you and even if you went and and went off by yourself God the holy spirit is going to keep he's going to keep penetrating your mind and your soul and he will bring back to remembrance the things that you've heard he will not surrender up he will not give up on that amen he got so inspired that finally Apostle Paul said thou Lord in the beginning you laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the work of thy hands and they Shall Perish you'll crumble them up you'll throw them in a waste basket Hall but Thou remainest You're the same and they shall wax old as does a garment and as a vesture shalt thou F them up and they shall and they shall be changed but Thou Art the same and your years fail not and no wonder through the Apostle John he'll cry out in Revelations and he that sat on the throne said yes this is the one who shed the blood he said behold attention people attention Clover the Bible Way I make all things [Music] new you're destined for a new body you're destined for a new home you're destined for a new city Hallelujah that's your [Applause] destination and if you don't have any sense of going there you may not rejoice over it but I tell you for people that have been looking for it and longing for it and that's why God says you're my son you're my daughter you believe [Music] meu I've been 10 minutes I will just be five amen and I'm going to quit wherever even I'm in the middle of a word I'm going to quit do you know why God got so inspired because he saw in that he saw in that life that was coming God is his knowledge isn't merely immense his knowledge is infinite he saw the church coming forth he saw the martyrs suffering for him he saw the Reformation he saw Luther and say I cannot Rec right I won't give up he saw him standing against that great Harlot church and he saw the reformers and he saw the messenger Here Comes one don't get me wrong like him this vessel he's like Moses yeah has slow cumbersome speech he can't express himself but he believes me amen he even write a letter to me and nail it on a tree he believes me he believes I'm here he believes I'm in the woods he believes I'm alive he believes I'm resurrected and God saw him coming coming out of that blood and he was so inspired I'll let him fulfill Luke 1730 I'll let the very life of my son issue out through him and I'll give him signs and I'll work wonders to him I'll let him tell the people The Secret of their heart like my son did hallelujah hallelujah and he needs a [Music] flaw I'll let his parents serve and worship the very Harlot system that he is so going to fight against I'll let them be overcome by alcohol the very demon that will take his life some completely under the influence in a drunken stuper and drive a car and smash head on in and let him lose his life his lips will be sealed I will allow that right right but he will never ER in his vision he will be another one that will hold to his vision and I want to say to this church I have been looking back not over the last year the last two years over the last 30 years and and and all the things that may happen in your life but I look back and I say God what was your vision your vision shall be my vision what did you intend here why did you raise us up to get this message out then thus shall it be this Congregation of people will hear me preach according to the initial Vision you've been raised up to be Witnesses of this end time message God was so inspired at the thought that this Vision that this vision would be fulfilled that's one of the reasons he struck him amen I haven't time but I must conclude with this now Here Comes This messenger and he meets seven angels and he goes back to speak brother Randy and sister Lori and you from Arizona brother West your wife and daughter Jessica you from Arizona others perhaps isn't it amazing of all the Earth God chose a spot out in that desert and he was so inspired and there were things that have been sealed up since the foundation of the world and his son is hanging on the cross his son is a beaten mass of humanity but he sees that there's going to be secret that are going to be made known to a people and it must be made known this Blood must speak speak Hallelujah and after the prophet of God had that visitation he came back and he said he spoke in the seals the opening of the seals he said I was so inspired sometimes hardly knowing what he's saying but he's so inspired because it had to reveal yeah Jesus Christ now and had to tell the people had to have a vessel so inspired I'll show him on the other side I'll take him beyond the curtain of time so inspired I'll show this messenger the bodies these people are going to live [Music] in right that's why he said I saw you all there amen you tell that devil you tell that evil one coming by to whisper in your ear I've heard different things than what you're telling me I've heard Eternal things you cannot you cannot impose this on me and you cannot impede my walk with God I reject you and I reject your voice because I've heard another voice hallelujah thank you my amen wonderful yes sir he said if there was ever anything if I've ever said anything that was inspired it was in that immediately after the angels of the Lord appeared and about the Seven Seals and I was to return back immediately after that he said here to Jeffersonville and preach the Seven Seals and I'm not just closing on a qu quiet note if I've ever said anything he said to thousands of people he said to the blind man in India he told me about that and he said there was tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of people and I've been in that church and stood Behind the Chair the chair that or the table rather that he stood he told me this man had been a sun worshipper and his eyes had been burned out by worshiping the sun you think you have a physical problem think of this one and his eyes had been burnt out and brother Brenham said as he stood there he's in Two Worlds and he looks and he sees The Sideburns are black real black but in the vision he sees it that there's a little gray hair see how accurate it was a little gray hair in it so he said I knew he was going to receive his sight but he says then I needed to exercise my my faith that it would happen right then and call for his healing thus sayith the Lord and the place went into pandemonium they were trying to pull pieces of his suit and his pants off so they have a piece of cloth they had to have the the ushers and the people try to protect him and that man went screaming as his eyes perfect he said he said he saw that he would he saw him and turn his head and look and he said I I saw that he had his sight and now he he he speaks sight for that person he what he's saying here is what he spoke to you and I under the opening of God's word is greater than giving that man his sight is greater than all the Supernatural friends he went up on a mountain like Moses went up on a mountain but he came down and he has a word that's been left us that's why I am consumed don't think it's just myself personally I'm consumed if there's anything in me I want to be getting this word to every last elected seed I've told you many times and I say may it be a theme of this church what we want to be able to do when we meet him when we go and meet him our our lord Jesus when we meet the messenger cuz we'll be gathered to the people of our age when we meet him you want to be able to look in his face and say brother brandom we did what we could Hallelujah we had a little fellow up maybe not much of a Preacher not deep in all of these things but he told us he wanted to just do what he could and that's what we doing God bless you people amen God bless you [Music] your flaw is valuable amen the value of your of the flaw may God ever make this in your Forefront of your mind oh Hallelujah hallu like to have you you stand with me and we'll sing my favorite brother Ryan is you had the mind of God I couldn't believe it I just walked into the study and I heard you singing I that sounds so familiar I went and turned the volume up and you
