[7:33] matters, oh God. Lord, we might have

[8:38] Hallelujah.
[8:40] Ask brother John Andy's to come this
[8:42] morning. Open the service in a word of
[8:44] prayer.
[8:48] We want to remember uh got a text this
[8:51] morning. Brother Bob Vineyard's going to
[8:53] be going in for surgery down in Seattle
[8:55] on the brain on Friday this coming week.
[8:58] So we want to remember the Vineyard
[8:59] family in prayer. Specifically, brother
[9:02] Bob at this time. There's a brother in a
[9:06] church in Bombay, India. his wife is
[9:08] having uh she has cancer on the breast
[9:11] is recovered but is still in much much
[9:14] pain. So just asking that the Lord would
[9:17] be mindful of her need this morning.
[9:19] Sister Virginia prayer request for
[9:22] Sister Evelyn in surgery today in
[9:24] Vancouver General and Sister Ida. Please
[9:27] remember in prayer the mystery expo
[9:30] meetings they'll be having the 25th 26th
[9:33] 27th at s San Carlos city in uh the
[9:38] Philippines. Brother uh the pastor there
[9:41] Rowell Soraniano and 50 other ministers
[9:45] will be demonstrating
[9:47] there at the mystery expo that brother
[9:48] Ernie helped to initiate many many years
[9:50] ago. The truth still marches on.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:55] Praise the Lord.
[9:57] Want to welcome those that are here this
[9:59] morning. I believe I don't have your
[10:00] names here in front of me, but uh God
[10:04] bless you this morning. Amen. It's good
[10:07] to have you here. Your entire family, I
[10:09] believe, is with you. Amen. God bless
[10:11] you. The Lord sees.
[10:14] Amen. Each and everyone that's here, the
[10:16] Lord Jesus has come.
[10:18] Not because I'm here, because you're
[10:20] here. He said, "If two or three would
[10:23] gather in my name, I'll be there in your
[10:25] midst." Amen. Brother John, you go.
[10:30] Let's all just bow our heads and forget
[10:32] about everyone else and just speak to
[10:34] the Lord Jesus today.
[10:36] Our heavenly father, we love you today,
[10:39] God. We just feel your Holy Spirit,
[10:41] Lord, all around. We just feel there's
[10:44] angels wings and the pillar of fire. The
[10:46] glory of the Lord has come down amongst
[10:49] your bride, Lord. And we are hungry. We
[10:51] are thirsty Lord. Our voices are coming
[10:54] up through the blood crying abba father
[10:57] pour out your spirit. Pour out your
[10:59] mercy. Pour out your grace. Extend down
[11:03] your salvation today in this assembly.
[11:06] Extend down your hand of Jehovah Gyra
[11:10] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[11:12] and forever. How we love you and adore
[11:15] you Lord. open up our mouths to praise
[11:18] your name right now, Lord, for all the
[11:20] great things that you have done for us,
[11:23] what you're doing for us, what you're
[11:25] going to do. Lord, we just pray that
[11:27] every barrier, every wall, every dark
[11:30] cloud would be broken today. The spirit
[11:33] of Satan and Lucifer would be broken.
[11:36] Shackles of darkness and unbelief that
[11:38] has held for years and complexes and
[11:41] lies would just vanish away, God. Oh
[11:45] father, send your holy spirit by your
[11:48] word today, Lord. Let it be thus sayeth
[11:51] the lord to the souls of the elect, God.
[11:54] Lord Jesus, as we heard your prophet
[11:56] today, an invisible union speaking about
[11:59] the sea of forgetfulness and how our
[12:02] lives were predestinated from before the
[12:05] foundation of the world. We cry back
[12:08] today. We believe that Lord and your
[12:11] predestinated seed has gathered in this
[12:14] room, Lord.
[12:15] We love you, God. We just love your
[12:17] appearing, God. Would you just come down
[12:20] today, God?
[12:22] Oh, Father, demonstrate your attributes
[12:25] of healing today of salvation. God, my
[12:30] heart has been so burdened for hearts of
[12:33] souls of young men, young ladies, Lord,
[12:36] that are lost, not out there, but right
[12:38] here among us, Lord. our very own
[12:41] children, our very own offspring, our
[12:44] very own token promises, Lord. And we
[12:47] have faith, Lord, to believe that you're
[12:50] here today to extend out your hand of
[12:52] forgiveness and mercy. There's lives
[12:55] that have need of a touch, Lord. Family
[12:57] members that are in for operations,
[13:00] tumors or cancers or things are hidden
[13:03] down behind, but Satan is exposed. The
[13:07] great operation and x-ray of the Holy
[13:10] Spirit is going to the heart of the
[13:12] matter today. Lord, root out unbelief
[13:14] among us, God. Root out sin that would
[13:17] be hiding somewhere. That would keep the
[13:20] blessings away. That would keep the
[13:22] flood tides of your glory from coming
[13:25] into this service, God.
[13:28] And when I heard about the sea of
[13:30] forgetfulness,
[13:33] Lord, we have a sea of forgetfulness
[13:36] that not even you can remember our past
[13:38] life anymore. Our sin, our poorness, our
[13:43] lives that were past, wretched and poor
[13:47] and beggarly. But we can jump with all
[13:50] of that's within us into that sea of
[13:52] forgetfulness and have faith to believe.
[13:55] You see nothing but white. You see
[13:58] nothing but lies that love you. You see
[14:01] nothing but lies that believe your every
[14:03] word. Father, may that water come up
[14:06] into this assembly today.
[14:12] May the water of the sea of
[14:13] forgetfulness come into this
[14:15] congregation. May the Tut flies come up
[14:19] into this church. Oh God, may Cloverdale
[14:22] Bible Way have individuals that are
[14:24] jumping into that sear for giftfulness
[14:27] and jumping out with their arms lifted
[14:29] up, praising God, giving hosanas and
[14:32] glories and praises.
[14:35] Our future is glorious. Lord, it's in
[14:38] the bosom and in the arms of our Jehovah
[14:41] God. Our future home calls to us,
[14:47] Father. We have needs among us even in
[14:50] our hearts Lord and we lift our feeble
[14:52] hands these prayer requests Lord we
[14:54] believe Jesus that you are the one that
[14:57] answers every prayer every request Lord
[15:00] and every need even today unspoken is
[15:03] being thunder broadcast through heaven
[15:07] as our thoughts are heard louder in
[15:09] heaven than our words are on earth you
[15:11] know the needs of all of us we pray for
[15:14] our pastor today that you would use the
[15:16] gift in his life. May thus sayeth the
[15:19] Lord move out across this pulpit. Lord
[15:21] Jesus, may the word that we have need of
[15:24] for our body change and for the needs
[15:27] within our lives be spoken today. And
[15:30] may that still small voice echo within
[15:33] our souls. And may it be 100% of a
[15:36] response saying, "Lord, we believe. We
[15:39] thank you, Jesus. We respond, Lord, to
[15:42] your word.
[15:44] Take the hidden things of our hearts and
[15:46] of our lives and uncover them out into
[15:49] your glory. Father, this whole day we
[15:51] sanctify and our visitors that are here
[15:53] and some to be baptized tonight. May the
[15:56] Holy Spirit fill every vessel, fill
[15:59] every heart, oh God, from the youngest
[16:01] to the oldest. May the Holy Spirit move
[16:04] mightily today.
[16:06] We're looking forward to it, Lord Jesus,
[16:09] that by the time the sun would set
[16:11] tonight, there would be miracles and
[16:13] divine healing and your glory would have
[16:15] moved in our souls, Lord. That your word
[16:18] would be great, Father, and do the
[16:20] supernatural among us that we feel
[16:23] already is happening right in this
[16:25] service, God. Be glorified in our lives,
[16:28] Lord. Be praised with our lives, Lord.
[16:30] Give us a glimpse of that other
[16:32] dimension, Jesus. We love your
[16:35] appearing. come again today in Jesus
[16:38] Christ's name. We thank you Lord.
[16:42] Amen.
[16:46] [Music]
[16:47] You deserve the glory
[16:51] [Music]
[16:53] and the honor.
[16:58] Lord, we lift our hands to worship
[17:04] as we praise your holy name. You deserve
[17:09] the glory. Oh, just wanted to praise
[17:12] now.
[17:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:18] Lord, we lift our hands to worship
[17:24] as we praise your holy name. For you are
[17:29] great.
[17:31] You do miracles so great. There is no
[17:37] one else like you.
[17:42] There is no one else like you. For you
[17:47] are great.
[17:50] You do miracles so great.
[17:54] There is no one else like you.
[18:01] There is no one else like you.
[18:11] Amen. And why don't you have your seats
[18:12] this morning as the deacons receive the
[18:15] morning tithes and offerings.
[18:21] Amen.
[18:30] Good morning. God bless you all. It's
[18:32] wonderful to be in the house of God.
[18:35] Amen. as we praise him, glorify the
[18:38] king, and look around the room and see
[18:39] the redeemed being gathered. It's a
[18:42] great blessing to be in the house of God
[18:43] this morning.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have a a family that has driven
[18:48] 1500 miles to be here today. That's
[18:51] three days journey. And the only reason
[18:54] for them being here this morning, they
[18:56] want to be baptized.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; So, you might have traveled across
[19:00] Langley, across the border, different
[19:02] things like that. They've driven 1500
[19:04] miles to be with us. And I would like
[19:07] the Devolt family. And uh Harley, I'd
[19:10] like you to stand up, please. We want to
[19:12] identify you. Brother Tony, Sister Rose,
[19:15] Peter, Harley,
[19:18] Katherine, God bless you.
[19:21] Amen.
[19:24] You have your seats. They traveled and
[19:26] we had the pleasure of meeting them
[19:27] yesterday, spending some time last
[19:29] evening, and they're going to be
[19:30] baptized this evening. So, you know,
[19:33] everybody has a journey. Everybody has
[19:35] how God deals with them. And and we
[19:37] dealt with each one individually, spoken
[19:39] to each one. All we think, well,
[19:41] collectively the family is being
[19:43] baptized. Well, collectively they are,
[19:45] but individually they are. Each one has
[19:48] their individual testimony and how God
[19:50] dealt with them and um they've tried to
[19:53] come up earlier over the last few years
[19:56] to come up to be here. Didn't quite
[19:58] happen, but it's happened this weekend.
[20:02] And uh we deem it a great honor to have
[20:04] you here, brother uh brother Tony with
[20:06] your wife, sister Rose, your children
[20:09] there and of course they're with your
[20:10] children. We have Harley. She's a friend
[20:12] of the families worked with them and
[20:14] she's coming. God deals in mysterious
[20:17] ways his wonders to perform. You wonder
[20:19] why you have a certain employee being
[20:21] employed by a certain employer. Well,
[20:24] God's got a great plan before the
[20:25] foundation of the world. Whether Harley
[20:28] knew it or not, God got a hold of her
[20:30] heart. And that's the main thing, Sister
[20:33] Harley. So, God bless you. Be praying
[20:35] for them this afternoon. And we're not
[20:38] and I told them as we I would tell all
[20:40] the ones that I speak to when we're
[20:42] being baptized. We don't rush into this.
[20:44] This is something that God has revealed
[20:46] to you. You're being moved to a greater
[20:49] depth than Christ. You're fulfilling the
[20:51] word of God. So, spend a day, as they've
[20:54] been spending three days driving, just
[20:56] desiring that God would fill them with
[20:58] the Holy Ghost and fire. And that will
[21:00] be our prayer also. That'll be a special
[21:02] time tonight. So we want to welcome you
[21:04] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[21:06] And God bless you for making the great
[21:08] journey. Amen.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; This is my story. This is my song. We
[21:14] don't want to take any more time this
[21:16] morning. Uh it's nice to sing, but we
[21:18] want to take advantage of our pastor
[21:20] today. Amen. We don't want him to feel
[21:22] rushed. I trust that you've come
[21:24] expecting and you're going to have your
[21:27] attention solely devoted on the word
[21:29] this morning. Pull on the gift of God.
[21:32] His age doesn't matter when the Holy
[21:34] Ghost comes.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; He's timeless.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. The vessel might be a little bit
[21:38] weary afterwards, but we'll all be
[21:40] benefited and we'll pray that the Lord
[21:42] will restore him.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we sing this together?
[21:45] This is one of our favorite songs that
[21:47] we enjoy singing because this is our
[21:49] life. This is our story. as we invite
[21:51] our pastor to come this morning. Blessed
[21:54] assurance, Jesus is mine.
[21:58] Blessed assurance,
[22:02] Jesus is mine.
[22:07] Oh, what a foraste
[22:11] of glory divine.
[22:16] of salvation.
[22:20] Presence of God,
[22:23] Lord of His
[22:29] love.
[22:32] This is my story.
[22:36] This is my song.
[22:40] Praising my savior
[22:44] all the day long.
[22:48] This is my story.
[22:52] This is my soul.

[24:17] am happy and blessed.

[24:44] myior.
[24:51] This is my
[24:55] This is my

[25:12] [Music]
[25:14] Praising my savior.
[25:17] [Music]
[25:21] This is my soul.
[25:24] [Music]
[25:25] This is my
[25:29] praising myior.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he wonderful?
[25:40] Praise the Lord.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; So nice to see you all here.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; More than that, he's here.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; He's the important one. He's the supreme
[25:49] one. We're so happy to have the Debolt
[25:52] family with us. God bless you. I've
[25:55] traveled so far and we're happy to
[25:58] participate and we're proud to have you
[26:00] here to be baptized. God bless you. I
[26:04] pray that God will just give you a
[26:06] double portion.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:11] Well, isn't he wonderful?
[26:13] &gt;&gt; I I just can't get away from the song. I
[26:16] would like to sing the chorus, at least
[26:18] maybe the first verse in the chorus,
[26:20] glory to his name.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; And you know how that came about. I was
[26:24] just thinking about everything that God
[26:26] has done supernaturally
[26:28] in every life.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; And all I could say is glory to his
[26:32] name.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; I'm so wondrously safe from sin. Amen.
[26:38] Why don't we just sing it and get ready
[26:40] for the word?
[26:42] You'll sing it.
[26:45] Where my savior died
[26:48] now,
[26:52] I
[26:55] heart.
[27:04] Glory to glory to his name. Glory to
[27:12] glory to
[27:15] my heart.
[27:19] Glory to you once again.
[27:24] Glory to his name.
[27:29] Glory to his name.
[27:35] There to my heart was the God of mine.
[27:40] Glory to his name.
[27:46] Amen.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; We say praise be to God.
[27:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; All right. We'll just bow our heads for
[27:54] a moment. Heavenly Father, as we are now
[27:58] approaching your word, how your prophet
[28:01] so often spoke of you as they approach
[28:05] the word, the author of the word and any
[28:09] man can turn the pages of the book, but
[28:12] only you can reveal and make known.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; You have a part. You have a portion,
[28:19] &gt;&gt; an allotted part for every person. You
[28:23] are a god of the that of of the
[28:26] individual. You dealt with the
[28:28] individual. You called each of us by
[28:30] name. You knew exactly what we needed.
[28:33] And now we are here today, Lord, and you
[28:36] have watched over our footsteps. You've
[28:38] brought us right to this time and to
[28:40] this season. I pray that you will
[28:42] impart, oh God, drive home the word,
[28:46] Father, that will give us courage and
[28:48] give us strength for the day and this
[28:51] time that we're in in Jesus Christ's
[28:53] name. Anoint both speaker and hearers,
[28:56] we pray for your glory.
[28:59] May thy kingdom be built up and
[29:01] strengthened in Jesus name. Amen.
[29:05] Amen. And I'll have you turn in the
[29:07] Bible if you would please to John
[29:10] the 5th chapter
[29:13] and we're going to read uh then we're
[29:15] going to read two verses out of John 10
[29:18] as well.
[29:21] So John 5 and verse 17
[29:25] 18 and 19
[29:28] we'll read. I want to carry on from
[29:31] a subject of a couple weeks ago
[29:34] uh the substance
[29:37] and evidence of the unsane.
[29:41] And we'll be reading that scripture also
[29:43] out of Hebrews 1 11 and1
[29:51] verse 17 of John 5.
[29:54] But Jesus answered them, "My father
[29:57] workketh hitherto,
[29:59] and I work."
[30:02] Therefore, the Jews sought the more to
[30:04] kill him, because not only he not only
[30:08] had broken the Sabbath, but said also
[30:12] that God was his father, making himself
[30:15] equal with God. Then answered Jesus and
[30:19] said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say
[30:21] unto you, the Son can do nothing of
[30:25] himself, but what he seeth the Father
[30:28] do,
[30:30] for what thingsoever he doeth, these
[30:35] also doeth the Son likewise."
[30:38] So I want us to see that this does not
[30:42] only apply to Jesus Christ, but it
[30:46] applies to his children,
[30:49] &gt;&gt; to us as believers.
[30:51] And I have a phrase that we will be
[30:53] using throughout the service. He doeth
[30:56] the works.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to say that.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; He doeth the works.
[31:04] I refer to when God spoke to you, he
[31:08] doeth the works. When God drew you, he
[31:12] doeth the work.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; When God supernaturally changed your
[31:16] life
[31:17] &gt;&gt; and God has led you in such a remarkable
[31:21] way. And we are not gathered here by
[31:24] accident.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; We are gathered here by design. And so
[31:29] we need to speak to him who is the
[31:31] designer and the sculptor.
[31:34] We've come from many different places,
[31:36] different countries, different
[31:38] backgrounds, different uh societies,
[31:41] different cultures. Uh very very
[31:44] different, vastly different, but yet
[31:46] we're melded together into this
[31:49] particular unit. And there is a
[31:52] particular design and order to it. And
[31:55] it's he has done the work. He doeth it.
[31:59] He doeth the work. Uh and so I I just
[32:03] see it ongoing ongoing. And I will be
[32:06] speaking something about that and it's
[32:09] very very remarkable.
[32:13] Then we'll turn to John 14 verse 10.
[32:22] Verse
[32:31] 10. Believest thou not that I am in the
[32:34] Father, and the Father in me? The words
[32:38] that I speak unto you, I speak not of
[32:40] myself, but the Father that dwelleth in
[32:44] me. Here it is, he doeth the works.
[32:49] Every person that has God, the spirit of
[32:51] God dwelling in them, they need to say
[32:54] and keeping always in mind, he doeth the
[32:56] works.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Believe me that I am in the Father and
[33:04] the Father in me, or else believe me for
[33:07] the very work's sake. I believe this was
[33:10] when Philip had just asked, "Show us the
[33:12] Father."
[33:13] And you'll find some places in the
[33:15] message where the prophet of God says,
[33:17] "Would you like to see the father?"
[33:19] &gt;&gt; "Would you like to see him?"
[33:21] &gt;&gt; And then just scroll down to the bottom
[33:24] of the message and you'll find
[33:26] &gt;&gt; that he was he was showing them the
[33:28] father.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; And then if we'll look please at 2
[33:33] Corinthians the 4th chapter just one
[33:37] verse.
[33:40] 2 Corinthians 4 and we'll read verse 18.
[33:55] While we look not at the things which
[33:57] are seen,
[33:59] but at the things which are not seen,
[34:02] for the things which are seen are
[34:05] temporal, but the things which are not
[34:08] seen are eternal. Let's read that verse
[34:12] together. While we look not at the
[34:15] things which are seen, but at the things
[34:17] which are not seen, for the things which
[34:20] are seen are temporal, and the things
[34:23] which are not seen are eternal.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may have your seats,
[34:29] and please keep your Bibles handy and
[34:31] open if you wouldn't mind.
[34:38] Apostle Paul said in Hebrews 11:1, "Now
[34:42] faith is the substance."
[34:46] Uh, I want you to think in terms of this
[34:48] substance.
[34:53] Faith is the substance
[34:56] of things hoped for.
[34:59] But it's also the evidence. And now I
[35:01] spoke the last time largely on the
[35:04] substance. God having to indwell the
[35:07] substance.
[35:10] And uh
[35:13] I just have many many scriptures
[35:16] where uh David said, "My substance was
[35:18] not hid from thee when I was made in
[35:22] secret and curiously rot in the lowest
[35:25] parts of the earth. My substance was not
[35:29] hid from thee." God said to Jeremiah,
[35:33] "Before you were conceived in the womb,
[35:37] before thy mother conceived thee, I
[35:39] ordained thee to be a prophet." Before
[35:42] the substance even came into being, he
[35:45] was already designed, ordained for
[35:49] certain certain and and God would see to
[35:53] it that that uh brother Bren talked
[35:56] about us being pre-planned. He said, "I
[35:58] guess you know that we were repl
[36:01] pre-planned."
[36:02] And he goes into that. And so that is
[36:05] not such a complicated thought for us.
[36:09] But
[36:10] I find that we go about our daily duties
[36:12] once we go out these doors and we start
[36:15] our daily duties etc. We kind of lose
[36:18] sight of those things of the eternal
[36:20] aspect and what we've been designed for
[36:22] and what we've been brought here for.
[36:25] And I want to bring that into some
[36:27] focus. And then I want to speak about
[36:29] the evidence.
[36:32] And just to give you a heads up, you
[36:34] know, evidence is what's provided in
[36:36] courts.
[36:38] And uh evidence can either free a person
[36:40] or damn a person.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; And it is doing that.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; It is doing that.
[36:49] So the subject that I would like to
[36:50] dwell on is the life of the unseen God.
[36:55] living in the substance of flesh or
[36:57] human flesh. The life of the unseen God
[37:03] living in the substance of flesh. So in
[37:07] Hebrews when we read the 11th chapter,
[37:10] it's a record of ordinary people, which
[37:14] I said the last time I spoke, they're
[37:17] ordinary people who believed what God
[37:20] promised and became the evidence of
[37:23] things unseen.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Just to describe that to you, Abraham
[37:30] believed the promise. He's the father of
[37:33] us all. He believed the promise. You
[37:35] know, we're all believing for something.
[37:38] We're all desiring something. We all
[37:40] have something that we're we're
[37:44] yearning for, we're anxious for, we're
[37:47] desiring, or we're holding to.
[37:51] I know that each one of us, if we had a
[37:53] if we had a moment maybe across the
[37:56] table from one another, that would
[37:58] finally come out. What I really desire
[38:01] from God is this. What I'm really
[38:03] hungering for is this. I'm for someone
[38:06] in my family or for something to take
[38:10] place or some burden that we have. Each
[38:13] one of us had that. And if we had the
[38:14] opportunity to come before the prophet
[38:16] of God, that would be the thing that
[38:18] would be on our heart. And often uh
[38:22] you'll hear brother Brandham saying,
[38:24] "Now you're real nervous." And then
[38:26] he'll say, "But let's just talk. I'd
[38:29] like to talk to you for a moment." and
[38:32] because and and then a moment later he'd
[38:35] say now yes you're real nervous but
[38:38] that's not really what you're here for.
[38:41] You're here for and often I ran across
[38:44] it several times yesterday and the day
[38:46] before but what you're really here for
[38:49] you're praying for someone. You're
[38:50] praying for a child. Uh I see it's a
[38:53] crippled child. It's a daughter. You're
[38:55] praying for a son. No, it's your
[38:57] son-in-law. Uh and he's been in the war.
[39:01] He was in Korea. And that's really now
[39:04] he's touching the
[39:06] &gt;&gt; Now he's touching really the deep spot.
[39:09] See, and God knows that deep spot while
[39:11] we're sitting here.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; And that's why I want you to bring, you
[39:14] know, to bring you right out of any
[39:16] shell that you might be in. God knows
[39:19] exactly what it is that is, you know,
[39:21] maybe something that you wouldn't even
[39:24] speak or express to anyone else, but
[39:26] you're holding it. God sees that. God
[39:30] knows that and God's on the in the
[39:33] business of changing things.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; God's in the business of transforming.
[39:39] He has already given us. It's just in
[39:41] fact is brother Brandham speaks about
[39:43] things. He said now if you were here for
[39:46] finances or here for something else he
[39:48] talked about maybe helping them believe
[39:50] for that. But he said as far as healing
[39:52] I can't heal you. I couldn't heal you.
[39:54] I'm just a man. If Jesus was standing
[39:57] here in my suit, he couldn't heal you
[39:59] because he's already done it.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; The the the the challenge is to get you
[40:04] to believe what's already done.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now you're already here.
[40:10] You're already assembled. You've already
[40:13] been born. I don't mean assembled here
[40:15] in this congregation, but you've been
[40:16] born. You've been brought into this
[40:18] world. But the big question is, why have
[40:21] you been brought here? Well, I was
[40:23] brought here to hear this word.
[40:25] Wonderful. Exactly. And now you've heard
[40:27] the word. Now why are we here? Well, God
[40:30] has a program. And that's what's
[40:32] important for us to grasp is God, you've
[40:36] got a program for me. And there's
[40:38] something important and there's
[40:40] something eternal. Help me to help me to
[40:43] evaluate things the way that they should
[40:46] be valued.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:50] So the Old Testament saints were the
[40:53] they their lives comprised the evidence
[40:56] of things that were not seen.
[40:58] Essentially they were the substance that
[41:01] testified of the existence of the only
[41:05] true God.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; That's what they did. Their lives
[41:09] testified or gave witness to the
[41:12] existence of the only true God.
[41:16] In this in the message the prophet said
[41:18] in ministry explained I cannot do a
[41:22] thing about it until he comes. You see
[41:25] I'm just as helpless as any creature in
[41:29] the world until he comes. Now there's
[41:32] even a prophet saying I'm helpless. I'm
[41:35] just a man.
[41:38] You're just a man. You're just a woman.
[41:40] You're just a person.
[41:42] We can't do anything. But when he comes,
[41:44] it's amazing what happens.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; And it's important that we realize and I
[41:52] hope to have you understand before this
[41:54] service is over where you will sense his
[41:56] presence. And that's that's the
[41:58] challenge for any minister is to bring
[42:01] you to the place where there's there's
[42:04] such a presence.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; There's such a presence. I'll be coming
[42:07] to in fact is I'll just feel to do it
[42:09] now. Brother Brandham was in a meeting
[42:14] and I guess it was in Germany because
[42:16] they had a translator, German translator
[42:20] and they were bringing up a a a line of
[42:24] people to be prayed for and there was
[42:27] about uh three or four he said on the
[42:30] platform and the the one they had
[42:33] helping the young man they had helping
[42:36] they said he wasn't too experienced and
[42:39] there was a little girl and and he could
[42:41] hear her mumbling something and uh he
[42:44] said he just picked her up and put her
[42:46] up on the platform. The platform was
[42:48] quite high
[42:50] and she was kind of near the edge of the
[42:53] platform. So, Brother Brandham reached
[42:56] to uh to get her because uh I don't know
[42:59] he just reached because she he said she
[43:01] was very near the edge of the platform
[43:04] and maybe a little later on the service
[43:06] if we have time I'll read that for you.
[43:08] But as he and then as she she kind of
[43:10] took a hold of his sleeve. He said, "I
[43:13] was wearing the same." He said, "I'm I'm
[43:15] wearing the same suit tonight. I was
[43:19] wearing them." He said, "I I got the
[43:22] suit from Oslo." And he said, "And she
[43:24] took a hold of my arm and and kind of
[43:28] took a hold of me." And he said, "Then
[43:30] uh then he saw she was blind." And he
[43:34] was concerned about her. And he and he
[43:37] and he just took her up in his arms and
[43:39] he said, "She just poor little thing."
[43:41] He said, "She just laid her head on my
[43:44] shoulder and she was snubbing, I guess,
[43:46] maybe just and uh that's the word he
[43:49] used. She was just kind of snubbing on
[43:51] his shoulder." And uh he began to uh rub
[43:56] his hand, just take his hand and stroke
[43:58] it down her platted hair like that. And
[44:01] he said, "Poor little thing." And uh and
[44:06] he he he started to pray for her. and he
[44:09] was I don't know what was going through
[44:10] his mind but he he started to pray for
[44:13] her and uh God opened her eyes but when
[44:17] she got put up by the man on the
[44:19] platform she had said to him I want to I
[44:23] want to feel the man I want I want to
[44:25] see the man that's going to pray for me
[44:28] and uh uh so they were having to go back
[44:31] and forth between the interpreter or the
[44:35] translator and then when he prayed for
[44:37] her and and her eyes were opened and and
[44:40] he looked at her eyes and and she he he
[44:43] said her eyes were starting to sparkle.
[44:46] Her eyes were sparkling and uh and she
[44:50] said, "I want to see mommy."
[44:53] And uh and her mom then, you know,
[44:55] things began to happen. Her mother
[44:57] screamed out in the audience and the
[44:59] vision is still now the prophet of God
[45:02] is still in another realm.
[45:05] And he he said, "I see her mother. Her
[45:09] mother's down here in the audience. I
[45:11] see her mother." Now, he's seeing it in
[45:13] the vision, but she's actually there.
[45:15] And here's this girl seeing it for the
[45:17] first time. And her mother is and the
[45:20] girl starts to cry. And her mother start
[45:23] her the little one when her eyes were
[45:25] first open, she said she she was saying,
[45:28] "What is that?" And she was it was the
[45:31] lights. And she hadn't seen lights
[45:33] before. So he said, "What is that?" And
[45:36] and the German interpreter has to
[45:39] interpret for for her, for him, for
[45:42] brother Brandham. And then the mother
[45:45] starts coming up and uh and and the
[45:48] girl, that's the first time she sees her
[45:51] mother and she said, "You're so
[45:52] beautiful." She said, "You're so
[45:53] beautiful." And brother Brandham says
[45:56] that the atmosphere
[46:00] &gt;&gt; see you might say, "Well, that was a
[46:01] wonderful miracle." No, the atmosphere,
[46:04] he said the atmosphere and the influence
[46:07] was so great it paralyzed the devil.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, here we are. We're not
[46:18] children. We're adults.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; And we have a record and we know it's
[46:23] true.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; And I say it's incumbent upon us as
[46:27] believers. We believe this. We believe
[46:31] this word. We believe this unseen God.
[46:35] We believe that he is present. We
[46:37] believe he's actually right beside every
[46:40] single person. And he knows exactly
[46:43] what's in your heart. And as we open
[46:45] ourselves up to him and say, "Oh God,
[46:49] &gt;&gt; you're the one who designed me.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; You made me a man. You made me a boy.
[46:53] You made me a girl. You made me a woman.
[46:55] You made me the married person that I
[46:58] am. You know exactly where I'm at and
[47:00] all of the things that have happened to
[47:02] and for and against and all these other
[47:05] things. You know all the battles I've
[47:07] gone through. You know all the
[47:09] experiences I've experienced. You know
[47:11] every single one of them. And you'll
[47:13] bring glory out of it.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; I say to you, let's paralyze the devil
[47:21] &gt;&gt; with an atmosphere here today.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We'll not give
[47:28] him any glory. We'll paralyze the devil
[47:33] in the name of Jesus Christ. Glory.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; You talk about atmosphere. That's what
[47:39] we want in this service. Atmosphere, not
[47:43] an atmosphere of skepticism or criticism
[47:46] or unbelief. We'll let that go.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Paralyze him.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus the son,
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus the son saw what the father he saw
[48:04] the father act and he acted likewise.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; God in the substance of the flesh of the
[48:12] son of God Jesus Christ performed the
[48:16] supernatural God in your flesh.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; That's why he gave you flesh
[48:21] &gt;&gt; so that he could dwell in it.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:29] Evidence of the unseen folding here
[48:33] in the realm of the mortals
[48:37] giving us faith in the season of
[48:40] immortality for the rapture journey.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Would you like me to read that again?
[48:47] &gt;&gt; I say evidence of the unseen. The
[48:50] evidence unfolding here. I believe in
[48:53] the evidence. Amen.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; You understand uh the scripture says
[48:58] that when the when the comforter come
[49:02] &gt;&gt; he will con he will reprove the world of
[49:05] sin. How will he reprove it? In you.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; And that's why you're not so popular.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus said the world will hate you.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Why will they hate you? They may not
[49:16] even express it. They but but if you cut
[49:20] a certain spot, you touch a certain
[49:22] spot, you'll find out that they're in
[49:25] opposition.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; They're not on the same page as you.
[49:29] They don't enjoy the same things as you.
[49:31] They don't enjoy the same conversation
[49:34] as you.
[49:37] I was up on a hunting trip once just
[49:39] come to my mind and there was a stranger
[49:42] there, another hunter from some other
[49:44] place and I don't know where he was in
[49:46] the world but anyway and the guy just
[49:49] sent us on. It was Lane Southwick. He
[49:51] sent us on just to walk together to a
[49:53] certain place. So he's walking and this
[49:55] man had a foul mouth. He was just a
[49:58] cursing and damning all the way and you
[50:00] know and we talked for a little short
[50:03] time and he said what what do you do Ed?
[50:07] I said I'm minister. Oh he said my
[50:12] he was he was absolutely I didn't have
[50:15] to say anything. He condemned himself.
[50:17] Oh my. He said you should have told me
[50:19] earlier. He said I've been I've been
[50:21] speaking some pretty awful language. I
[50:24] said well you might as well be what you
[50:25] are. You know, I didn't want him just to
[50:28] shine up to be good just for me. He
[50:30] might as well be what he is because he
[50:32] was his own condemnation.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; You see, the thing is,
[50:38] &gt;&gt; you're evidence
[50:40] &gt;&gt; and you're evidence that there's a holy
[50:42] God.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; You're evidence that there's another
[50:44] kingdom. You're evidence that Jesus
[50:47] Christ himself has been revealed. You're
[50:50] evidence that there's power in the word
[50:52] to transform a nature, a character.
[50:56] You're evidence of that and the more you
[50:58] give yourself to it, the more real it
[51:00] will be. That's the evidence. Your
[51:03] evidence of the unseen
[51:05] &gt;&gt; in at this time and in this season.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; And for the word that God has brought.
[51:12] Now,
[51:13] there's uh I read this to you last week,
[51:16] but I don't want to just read it to you.
[51:20] Uh,
[51:22] I want to
[51:26] I want you to see it on the
[51:40] See,
[51:45] it's the next one. The angel of God,
[51:48] right? All
[52:06] right.
[52:09] Now, many times this is all coming up at
[52:13] once and I would prefer just one at a
[52:15] time.
[52:19] just to give you uh I'd like to have you
[52:23] turn your turn your imagination
[52:26] turn your spirits loose if you would
[52:29] please.
[52:31] Many times out in the buildings you'll
[52:34] hear me call people and say things
[52:38] said I see it materialize
[52:42] the very life before me materializes.
[52:45] I'd just like to stop there. Don't read
[52:48] any further for a moment. The life and
[52:52] I'm going to I'm going to read where
[52:55] where the prophet of God says
[52:59] now he says uh
[53:02] I'm just giving this from memory. He
[53:04] said now this this star this old star
[53:09] that we're on. He said it God in the
[53:13] beginning moved it around and moved it
[53:16] around the sun and hung it there. He
[53:19] said maybe for a hundred billion years
[53:26] and he's hanging it there and then some
[53:28] gases were formed and then rolled it
[53:32] around. Then some calcium and volcanics
[53:35] burst forth and different things and he
[53:38] said, "What's he doing? What was he
[53:40] doing?
[53:42] He said he's making you
[53:45] &gt;&gt; and me.
[53:47] Now, now I know we could shut that all
[53:49] down and block it out of our minds, but
[53:52] I'm going to bring it down.
[53:55] If a prophet could look back and say to
[53:58] a person standing here at the platform,
[54:01] now when you were a child, he said to
[54:05] one woman, he said, "Can I say it?" He
[54:08] asked her if he could say it. Well, yes.
[54:12] I guess he got okay from her. He said,
[54:14] "When you were a child, when you were
[54:16] just a girl, you fell down a well."
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Imagine.
[54:22] He He's He's not seeing a vision. It's
[54:24] not It's not some technical or
[54:26] television. He's He was actually there.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. You don't know what
[54:31] it is to go back in a person's life and
[54:33] to stand there. And that's why he
[54:35] doesn't know. If you see the if you see
[54:37] the deep calls the deep, next time you
[54:39] see it, you watch him and he's talking
[54:41] to this woman and he's shaking his head.
[54:44] You know why he's shaking his head? He
[54:45] doesn't know whether he's back there or
[54:47] here.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; He doesn't know whether is this the He
[54:51] says, "Is this the person? Is this the
[54:53] patient?" Cuz he doesn't know where is
[54:55] it.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; You understand? That's why he says it
[54:58] just tears a person up. Now I'm coming
[55:01] to you. So he says to this lady because
[55:05] you you when you were a child you fell
[55:07] down a well and they've operated and
[55:09] trying to find out what's wrong but
[55:11] loose loosened your organs inside and
[55:15] they can't find what's wrong.
[55:20] Now if a person can go back if God takes
[55:24] a designs a person says you're going to
[55:28] go back in this person's life maybe see
[55:32] us as children
[55:34] see us at some junction in our life
[55:40] if you can go back 10 years what's wrong
[55:43] going back a hundred years
[55:46] &gt;&gt; if a person go back a hundred years
[55:49] because they're made they're made that
[55:50] way.
[55:52] Maybe went back a 100red billion years.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; And saw he said, "I see a life
[56:00] materializing."
[56:02] Said, "It's a girl.
[56:06] It's a girl." And then he follows it and
[56:08] he says, "Then then things happen. Maybe
[56:11] the girl got into trouble. Maybe she had
[56:14] difficulties. Maybe all kinds of things.
[56:17] But God now God
[56:21] I want you to see who it is that has
[56:24] actually God used to speak this message
[56:26] that called you.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; I need you to see that this wasn't
[56:33] designed you're not here designed by
[56:35] your mother and father.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; This had nothing to do with where you
[56:40] came from or the country you came from
[56:43] or your parents or your roots. It has
[56:46] nothing to do with that. Your roots are
[56:48] in mind of God. That's where the roots
[56:51] are.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; And God had a mind. God had an intent.
[56:56] And it's God that's designed things. And
[56:58] it's God that brought you maybe brought
[57:01] you to this church cuz you needed to rub
[57:03] shoulders with somebody because God in
[57:05] his mind of he's putting things
[57:07] together. He knew exactly what you
[57:10] needed.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; And I would say we ought to give glory
[57:13] to him. He knew that I needed to be
[57:15] right here
[57:17] &gt;&gt; at this moment to hear these words.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, Brother Biscll, do
[57:21] you really think what you're saying is
[57:23] that important?" Yeah, I do.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; I actually do. I believe it's that
[57:28] important. And I believe that this God
[57:31] that speaks to this prophet has brought
[57:34] you here. You You were attracted to a
[57:37] message, but brought you here. And he
[57:39] knew exactly what you were needing and
[57:41] for your journey for this change of the
[57:44] body or this rapture journey or whatever
[57:47] it is that we're facing. Whether it's a
[57:50] battle you're facing tomorrow or the
[57:52] enemy you're facing tomorrow, you need
[57:54] to hear what's being said today.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; And we need a better we need a better
[57:59] understanding of God.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; And so he said, I see a life
[58:04] materializing.
[58:07] I said to my wife at the table, I said,
[58:10] "Maybe that was back just when there was
[58:12] some chemicals,
[58:14] some
[58:17] phosphorus or something out of the
[58:19] earth. He was making you." He said he
[58:22] was making me.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Is that just something poetic or is that
[58:27] actually truth? So I said to her, I
[58:29] said, "When did he see this girl? When
[58:32] did he see this life materializing?"
[58:36] And then it doesn't stop there. He said
[58:38] I see it materialize.
[58:40] The very life before me materializes.
[58:45] Says maybe I start here and look yonder.
[58:48] He said I see a little girl say he's
[58:52] just using an example. said, "See, I see
[58:54] a little girl say
[58:57] and uh I'll and it'll start
[59:00] materializing
[59:02] and I see the way she's and he breaks
[59:06] because maybe things take place and
[59:07] happen
[59:09] something happens and I'll just start
[59:12] speaking what I see and then after a
[59:16] while I'll leave. it'll leave before me
[59:20] and maybe right along here sets the
[59:22] woman.
[59:26] Now he's saying a life materializing
[59:29] coming into being and and and
[59:32] materializing is is coming into
[59:35] existence or uh it's it's appearing. I
[59:39] see it materializing and it's it's a
[59:41] little girl and then it'll materialize
[59:44] and I and then and the woman is sitting
[59:47] right here.
[59:50] And he goes on further. He continues.
[59:53] He's describing it. This is the best
[59:55] description I've ever found. And he
[59:57] said, "She's done come down
[1:00:00] to this age and I see where she's at."
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, friends, we got
[1:00:06] something to deal with.
[1:00:09] Amen.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; I want to get out of your mind forever
[1:00:13] that you're just here. You're just
[1:00:15] working at a job. You're just employed.
[1:00:17] You're making your way through life.
[1:00:21] And the reason why we don't get things
[1:00:23] from God is we don't know who he is.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; We need to understand who we are.
[1:00:30] We need to actually understand and you
[1:00:33] cannot put enough emphasizes emphasis on
[1:00:36] the purchase of the blood of God.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Not just the blood of Jesus Christ but
[1:00:41] the blood of God. You have to see him as
[1:00:44] God.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; I say both brother Brandham and the
[1:00:54] woman are evidence of the unseen. Amen.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Said, "I I'm seeing and and you'll find
[1:01:01] I I'll ask you just for a moment. I'll
[1:01:04] ask you, what ministers have you ever
[1:01:06] heard use the word materializing?
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; I see a life." And and I guarantee you,
[1:01:12] you'll never hear them say, "I see a
[1:01:15] life materializing.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; I see something materializing."
[1:01:20] And then identify, "Oh, here it is.
[1:01:22] Right here.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Here's the woman sitting right here. God
[1:01:26] God has done brought her down to this
[1:01:29] age.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Isn't that remarkable? And I'll say, God
[1:01:33] has done brought you down to this age.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; God brought you right down to this very
[1:01:39] age. And what was his purpose? That you
[1:01:42] might hear his word.
[1:01:45] [Music]
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John 10, I'm just going to
[1:01:55] read some scripture. If I do not the
[1:01:57] works of my father, see these are his
[1:02:01] works. That's why I had you quote, "He
[1:02:04] doeth the works."
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; I say, "Where did you come from?" Yeah.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Well, I come from Congo or I came from a
[1:02:15] colony or I came from I came from
[1:02:18] northern Canada or I came from Oh, you
[1:02:21] don't know where I've been. I've been in
[1:02:22] some dark places. He's the one that
[1:02:25] brought you out of it.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; He's the one who delivered you.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; He's the one who set you here amongst
[1:02:31] angels,
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; amongst sons and daughters of God. He
[1:02:34] has done that because he's not done and
[1:02:36] he plans to take you to his kingdom and
[1:02:40] you'll be in his kingdom. It's not just
[1:02:42] some words in a song. I've got a mansion
[1:02:44] over the hilltop or I'll walk on streets
[1:02:47] of purest gold. All of those things,
[1:02:49] those are maybe figments of somebody's
[1:02:51] imagination. But there's a reality right
[1:02:55] beside us. There's another kingdom.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not the administration
[1:03:00] in Washington. It's not the government
[1:03:02] in Ottawa. It's not the uh it's not the
[1:03:06] union in the European Union. It's none
[1:03:09] of these things. this world will go on
[1:03:11] with its strife and its economics and
[1:03:13] its failures and all of those things. We
[1:03:16] have nothing to do with this world.
[1:03:18] We're from another world. We're from
[1:03:20] another kingdom and we need to be
[1:03:23] mindful of that kingdom. We can't let we
[1:03:26] not can't let Satan displace us or
[1:03:30] displace what's important in the kingdom
[1:03:33] of God with with all the things of this
[1:03:36] material world. This is his kingdom.
[1:03:39] That's right.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; This is Satan's kingdom.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Says, "If I do not the works of my
[1:03:45] father, believe me not. But if I do,
[1:03:48] though you believe not me, believe the
[1:03:52] works that you may know and believe that
[1:03:55] the Father is in me and I in him."
[1:03:59] Therefore, they sought again to take
[1:04:01] him, but he escaped out of their hand.
[1:04:04] And in Colossians, it speaks of Christ
[1:04:07] who is the image of the invisible God,
[1:04:10] the firstborn of every creature. And
[1:04:13] then Apostle Paul carries on the same
[1:04:16] the same theme. He said, "I am crucified
[1:04:19] with Christ. Nevertheless, I live yet
[1:04:23] not I,
[1:04:25] but Christ liveth in me."
[1:04:28] And now is that only given to Apostle
[1:04:30] Paul or can you take your name and said
[1:04:33] Christ liveth in me.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; The father liveth in me.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; The father doeth the works.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; The kind of vision that you might have
[1:04:47] might not be when we think of vision we
[1:04:50] think of maybe something like a
[1:04:52] television screen. Get that out of your
[1:04:54] mind. It might be just uh it might be
[1:04:57] something you can't even define but you
[1:05:00] have a certain uh impulse a certain
[1:05:04] direction.
[1:05:06] I said uh I was speaking to a wife. I
[1:05:08] said what brought us from Ontario here.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; I said it was a vision. God didn't give
[1:05:14] me a vision. You're going to do this and
[1:05:15] you're going to do that and define it.
[1:05:17] But I just I I I you know enough that
[1:05:20] you have to you have to pick up and
[1:05:22] leave. Brother Joe Walder. Sister
[1:05:24] Eileen, uh, you know that you have to do
[1:05:27] it. You've read something, you've
[1:05:29] touched something, uh, and you don't
[1:05:31] know that your family is going to be
[1:05:33] affected. You just don't know that your
[1:05:35] children are going to be so affected by
[1:05:38] this word. And, and you following
[1:05:40] something unseen. You're you're a seed
[1:05:43] or son or daughter of of of of Abraham,
[1:05:48] and you're walking where you don't know
[1:05:49] you're going to walk.
[1:05:52] You don't know it's going to be this
[1:05:54] way, but God knows. He's not taken by
[1:05:57] surprise. I see your sister Sharon Andes
[1:05:59] and from Australia and you marry John
[1:06:02] Andy sitting here as a as a minister's
[1:06:05] wife. How does God know those things?
[1:06:08] Brother Andes, I'm I'm talking about a
[1:06:10] lot of people today that are sitting
[1:06:12] here in this congregation. I want you to
[1:06:14] see it's this God that God saw you. Oh,
[1:06:18] there I see a I see a life
[1:06:20] materializing. I see a boy
[1:06:23] materializing. I see a life of a man
[1:06:25] materializing. Hallelujah. And maybe
[1:06:28] they I'll I'll move upon them somehow
[1:06:31] and they'll drive all the way from
[1:06:33] Colorado to be baptized. And that just
[1:06:36] think of it. Is that an accident or is
[1:06:39] that a reality that God had in his mind?
[1:06:42] And then you must say, well, what is
[1:06:44] God's mind? What is in God's mind? And
[1:06:47] now he had a prophet messenger to bring
[1:06:49] such astounding and profound things out
[1:06:53] of the message full of secrets and full
[1:06:56] of uh full of nuggets that are treasures
[1:06:59] absolute treasures. You can't read this
[1:07:02] Bible like a paperback book. You can't
[1:07:05] read this Bible like a newspaper. This
[1:07:08] is full of the mysteries of God.
[1:07:11] Hallelujah. And it took a messenger to
[1:07:13] be able, he said, "Now in the back part
[1:07:15] of God's mind, in Christ is the mystery
[1:07:18] of God revealed." In the back part of
[1:07:19] God's mind, I can tell you that in that
[1:07:22] message that contains things that were
[1:07:24] in the back part of God's mind, you you
[1:07:27] try to read it and think, "Well, I'll
[1:07:29] just read this and I'll just, you know,
[1:07:31] be able to get it all." No, you won't
[1:07:33] get it all. You ponder it and you pray
[1:07:35] about it and you think about it and you
[1:07:37] dwell on it maybe for days or even weeks
[1:07:41] and even over a period of years it just
[1:07:43] expands and expands. But sometimes I
[1:07:46] say, "Oh God, what you had in your mind?
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Make us to know what you had in your
[1:07:53] mind for me." And we get all taken up
[1:07:55] with this all this problem and this
[1:07:58] little thing and my job and oh forget
[1:08:01] it.
[1:08:03] God who hung this old star that we're
[1:08:06] walking on for a hundred billion years
[1:08:09] and saw some gases come up like a great
[1:08:13] contractor. He said, "I'm making my
[1:08:15] family."
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; No wonder he says to Isaiah, no wonder
[1:08:20] he say speaks to Isaiah and says,
[1:08:22] "Where's my household? Where's my
[1:08:25] family? The earth, he said, my hands
[1:08:28] have made the heavens. The earth is my
[1:08:31] foottool, but where's my household?
[1:08:34] Where's my children? Where's my family?
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; He'd been planning you for a long time.
[1:08:44] He'd been planning this congregation for
[1:08:46] a long time. He'd been planning way back
[1:08:49] in the eternities. He'd been planning,
[1:08:51] I'm going to have a certain person,
[1:08:53] going to have a certain individual, and
[1:08:55] this individual is going to love me.
[1:08:58] [Applause]
[1:09:00] When people hate me, they're going to
[1:09:02] love me.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; They're going to know my presence.
[1:09:08] They're going to love my presence.
[1:09:15] [Music]
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is God's prophet,
[1:09:22] messenger,
[1:09:24] the unseen God.
[1:09:27] the unseen God.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; If you have to move or leave, don't
[1:09:34] leave too long.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; The unseen God through the prophet
[1:09:40] substance
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; giving absolute evidence of the
[1:09:46] resurrection of his beloved son Jesus
[1:09:49] Christ.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Did you get that? Amen.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; The unseen God
[1:09:55] through the substance through the
[1:09:57] physical substance of a prophet of God,
[1:10:01] his messenger in this age, giving
[1:10:03] absolute evidence of the resurrection of
[1:10:06] the of his beloved son Jesus Christ.
[1:10:13] He said, "It's not me."
[1:10:16] He said, uh,
[1:10:19] like the pool of Bethesda, likening
[1:10:21] himself to the pool of Bethesda,
[1:10:24] he said it couldn't say, the pool of
[1:10:25] Bethesda couldn't say, "Look what a
[1:10:28] great water I am."
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; For when the angel went off of the
[1:10:34] water, it was just water.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now I'm just your brother."
[1:10:40] Hallelujah.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; It's good to realize that we're just
[1:10:45] flesh and blood.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; We're a brother to a brother. We're a
[1:10:48] brother to another sister. We're one
[1:10:51] another. But it goes beyond that. And by
[1:10:54] the grace of God. And when the angel of
[1:10:56] the Lord moves down, it becomes then the
[1:10:59] voice of God to you.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Does this congregation get that? Amen.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; And then when as then when the angel of
[1:11:11] the Lord moves down, it becomes the
[1:11:14] voice of God to you. I want to say to
[1:11:18] you as individuals, you walk around, but
[1:11:21] when you're full of the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:24] filled with the spirit of God and
[1:11:26] sensitive to that spirit, whether you're
[1:11:28] on the job or whether you're in your
[1:11:30] business or on your farm or wherever you
[1:11:32] are, and you realize that there are
[1:11:35] there is a moment when the spirit of God
[1:11:38] comes down
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; and then that's the voice of God to that
[1:11:41] person.
[1:11:43] I had the experience a couple weeks ago.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; I'm driving down the freeway.
[1:11:54] I'd heard that a certain person wanted
[1:11:56] to speak to me.
[1:11:59] And when I'm driving down the highway,
[1:12:04] the Holy Spirit spoke to this heart.
[1:12:07] Said he wants to make things right.
[1:12:11] Amen.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; I went out in the valley,
[1:12:16] spoke to a man who just had some
[1:12:19] infection in his body.
[1:12:22] His wife was there.
[1:12:24] He said, "I should have spoke to you
[1:12:26] before." I said, "Yeah, but that wasn't
[1:12:29] your mistake."
[1:12:31] I said, "Your mistake was you left."
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; I said, "Why did you leave?" And his
[1:12:36] wife was sitting right beside me. I
[1:12:38] said, "Was it you or was it him?" That
[1:12:41] was a mistake.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Were you the one that did it or was he
[1:12:46] the one? No, he said I was the one. I
[1:12:48] said that was your mistake. Not that you
[1:12:51] didn't come and talk to me, but that you
[1:12:54] left.
[1:12:57] I got a text yesterday.
[1:13:00] The man didn't know it. He didn't know
[1:13:03] it, but he has stage four cancer. He's
[1:13:06] been given six months to live.
[1:13:09] Tell you what, friends, we're not
[1:13:11] playing a game down here.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; And when God, the Holy Spirit comes and
[1:13:17] speaks to a person, and he spoke to me
[1:13:19] twice, while I'm still driving
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; and said, "And don't you lighten up on
[1:13:24] it.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Don't you lighten up. Don't you make
[1:13:26] this just, you know, oh, that's fine.
[1:13:29] It's easy. It's not that. You scrape it
[1:13:32] down to the bottom." And I saw myself
[1:13:34] scraping it right to the bottom. So as
[1:13:37] soon as that was said, I said that was
[1:13:39] not your mistake. Your mistake was and I
[1:13:41] said that was what was wrong. He said
[1:13:44] and I and I told him that God told me he
[1:13:47] wants to make it right. He says I do. I
[1:13:49] want you to forgive me.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that in the back part of
[1:13:54] God's mind, he knows exactly where a
[1:13:58] person's going and how long he has to
[1:14:01] stay here and what he needs to do. And
[1:14:04] he is as abundant grace of God. Isn't it
[1:14:07] marvelous that he comes in such a way
[1:14:10] and speaks to an individual and gives
[1:14:12] them the added grace
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; to make it right before he comes into
[1:14:17] his presence. I say, "Oh, glory to God.
[1:14:21] Glory to God.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God."
[1:14:26] [Music]
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, we're not playing some
[1:14:29] little kind of a game. We're in the
[1:14:32] biggest business in the land. I don't
[1:14:35] care where you work or what you do.
[1:14:37] That's secondary to what we have we have
[1:14:40] a commission to do. This is in the
[1:14:42] business of soul saving. This is in the
[1:14:45] business of delivering men and women out
[1:14:48] of the grip of Satan. Satan, we paralyze
[1:14:52] you
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:59] Hallelujah.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "And the water
[1:15:03] can't say what a great water I am at
[1:15:05] Beth Bethesda."
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; And he said, "After the Holy Spirit's
[1:15:09] gone, it's just water."
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "And I've if I offended you by
[1:15:14] saying that," he said, "forgive me, but
[1:15:16] I felt that might be resented, but I am
[1:15:19] God's voice to you.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; I say that again. that time was under
[1:15:24] inspiration and I felt bad about the
[1:15:27] first time. Think of it. He said, "I'm
[1:15:29] God's voice to you." And he felt bad
[1:15:31] about it because there was so much
[1:15:33] resentment from someone in the
[1:15:35] congregation. But he said, "I'll say it
[1:15:37] again. I am God's voice to you." And I
[1:15:40] don't have any resentment at this time.
[1:15:42] Glory to God. Hallelujah. When you speak
[1:15:46] the truth, you might as well stay with
[1:15:48] the truth.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; You're God's blessing. You're God's
[1:15:53] blessing to the earth. Think about
[1:15:55] Abraham. He had to say, "Because I I who
[1:15:59] blesses you, I will bless and who curses
[1:16:02] you, I will curse. Out of you will come
[1:16:04] kings and nations." Think about it. A
[1:16:07] man with his sheep and his camels and
[1:16:10] with his donkeys saying, "I'm kings are
[1:16:13] in me."
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Without being proud, he realizes his
[1:16:20] position.
[1:16:23] You're a son of God.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; You were being made a hundred billion
[1:16:28] years ago.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Some gases were coming forth or potsh
[1:16:33] was coming or whatever was coming. I
[1:16:35] have people who ever said, you know, he
[1:16:38] the brother Brandham speaks about uh the
[1:16:42] cosmic light and different things that
[1:16:44] are in us and petroleum. And this man
[1:16:46] was very educated man. And he says, "We
[1:16:49] don't have any petroleum in us."
[1:16:54] Well, I don't know. If we got squished
[1:16:56] out on the road, there might be some
[1:16:58] petroleum there.
[1:17:02] Who would I sooner believe?
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; I sooner believe somebody who says,
[1:17:05] "Well, I got a doctor's degree." I say,
[1:17:07] "I sooner have a prophet's degree."
[1:17:16] said, "I can say nothing of myself,
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; but what he shows me,
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; I say it.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; You believe it, and watch what happens.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen."
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Now, the evidence.
[1:17:34] Evidence, as I said earlier, there's two
[1:17:36] sides to evidence. Evidence can free a
[1:17:39] person. Evidence can condemn a person.
[1:17:42] And when he, the Spirit of truth, has
[1:17:44] come, he will convict the world of sin
[1:17:47] and of righteousness and of judgment to
[1:17:50] come.
[1:17:56] I have those scriptures here.
[1:18:00] Nevertheless, I tell you the truth. It
[1:18:03] is expedient for you that I go away,
[1:18:05] Jesus said. And if I go not away, the
[1:18:08] comforter will not come unto you. But if
[1:18:11] I depart, I will send him unto you. And
[1:18:14] when he has come, and when he has come,
[1:18:17] and people say, "Oh, I'm full of the
[1:18:19] Holy Ghost." Well, get trouble. Get
[1:18:20] ready for trouble because it says that
[1:18:23] when he has come, he will reprove the
[1:18:26] world of sin, of unbelief, in other
[1:18:29] words, and of righteousness and of
[1:18:31] judgment. Hello.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Hello, congregation.
[1:18:36] when the Holy Ghost and and if we just
[1:18:38] said, "How many here have the Holy
[1:18:40] Ghost?" And I might get quite a few
[1:18:42] hands up. Well, if you have the Holy
[1:18:44] Ghost, one thing that he's going to do
[1:18:46] is reprove the world of sin.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Your life, you don't have to even say
[1:18:50] it. Your life will reprove the world of
[1:18:53] sin.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Your life will convict them of sin and
[1:18:57] uncleanness. Your life will do it. All
[1:19:00] you have to do is you can live a message
[1:19:02] and your message will be screaming out
[1:19:04] louder than I am.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Of sin because they believe not on me.
[1:19:16] Of righteousness because I go to my
[1:19:18] father and you see me no more. He
[1:19:20] becomes unseen.
[1:19:23] You become a testimony. A testament of
[1:19:26] what is unseen.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; The invisible God becomes visible as
[1:19:33] visible as they're going to see it.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; No wonder that man, brother Milco
[1:19:39] Yugoslavia, called the Bible man, called
[1:19:42] the man of God, walks into a house in
[1:19:45] the middle of the night, snow on the
[1:19:47] ground, and that's how they could see
[1:19:49] his stature in the doorway is a large
[1:19:51] man, quite tall. and a girl 15 years old
[1:19:55] is is uh sleeping on the hearth of the
[1:19:58] fireplace. I looked at the fireplace, my
[1:20:00] wife looked at it,
[1:20:03] we had bread in that woman's house,
[1:20:08] 200y old home, and when that man stood
[1:20:12] in the door and the stepfather of this
[1:20:15] girl was alcoholic.
[1:20:18] If you want to read about her life, the
[1:20:21] books are in the bookstore
[1:20:23] entitled
[1:20:25] Of Whom the World is Not Worthy.
[1:20:28] Don't start reading it in the evening
[1:20:30] because you'll be reading it and
[1:20:32] throughout the night. How many have read
[1:20:34] the book of Whom the World is Not
[1:20:35] Worthy? Quite a few.
[1:20:39] Well, we we've had lunch with that
[1:20:41] sister
[1:20:43] and heard about her life. In fact, as I
[1:20:46] filmed it, the film's somewhere up here.
[1:20:49] Don't ask me to produce something, but
[1:20:51] it we do have it.
[1:20:54] And that man came and stood in the door
[1:20:57] and he said, "This night, has Jesus
[1:21:01] Christ come to this home?"
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; I would say one thing. I don't know
[1:21:06] anything about his background, but he
[1:21:08] certainly had a revelation of what he
[1:21:09] was there for. He certainly knew why he
[1:21:12] was there. And many years later he
[1:21:15] married that 15year-old girl
[1:21:18] and that was her. He became known as the
[1:21:21] Bible man. Walked all over Yugoslavia
[1:21:24] for former Yugoslavia giving out Bibles
[1:21:28] and preaching the gospel.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Today
[1:21:38] he doeth the works.
[1:21:42] Oh,
[1:21:51] and the message why we're not a
[1:21:53] denomination. I'm I'm trying to
[1:21:54] abbreviate this a wee bit.
[1:21:57] He said he moved around this old star
[1:22:00] that we're living on now
[1:22:02] where you are.
[1:22:05] And uh he said this earth and he molded
[1:22:08] over here by the sun and laid it around
[1:22:12] the sun. Say here's the sun. He molded
[1:22:15] it on this side and let it hang there
[1:22:18] for a 100red billion years. What was he
[1:22:21] making? Some gases. He moved around on
[1:22:25] this side. He made something else. What
[1:22:28] was he making there? Some potach.
[1:22:31] He moved around this way. And what was
[1:22:34] he doing here? Making some calcium. He
[1:22:38] asks, "What was he doing?"
[1:22:41] He was making you and me.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; That's our father.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Our father which art in heaven.
[1:22:51] You had a plan. Let your kingdom come.
[1:22:55] So glad that you saw this little might
[1:22:59] of a person on this old star.
[1:23:04] You called me.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; I even heard your voice.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; You called me. Did you hear his voice?
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Is that why you're here?
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Then he's not done with his plan. Oh
[1:23:19] friends, don't let the little
[1:23:22] insignificant stuff of this world
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; displace or derail or preoccupy
[1:23:29] your mind. Give God first place.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; And he said, what was he doing like the
[1:23:37] contractor laying out all of his 2x4s
[1:23:40] and 2x8s, his cheating, his sighting? He
[1:23:44] said he knowed just how many buildings
[1:23:48] he was going to build.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; I got a little ways to go. Are you all
[1:23:57] right?
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; He knew how just how many. He knows that
[1:24:01] just how many. And that's why the
[1:24:02] prophet says the last one when the last
[1:24:05] one comes in was the last building he
[1:24:07] built. The last one he had in his mind.
[1:24:10] When the last one comes in, we're done.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; We're out of here.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; He says we're made out of the 16
[1:24:22] elements of the earth. And he was making
[1:24:24] us all
[1:24:27] and laying us out there before the world
[1:24:30] ever come into. And then he breaks off.
[1:24:34] He let them old volcanics brood up there
[1:24:37] for a hundred million years to make some
[1:24:40] calcium. What is it? It's part of you.
[1:24:44] And then in one of his last messages,
[1:24:47] things that are to be, you hear these
[1:24:49] words, friends, I'm so glad that God had
[1:24:53] such a a messenger that was so elusive
[1:24:56] to the world
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; that the businessmen couldn't catch it,
[1:25:01] scholars couldn't catch it. Theologians
[1:25:04] couldn't catch it. Fishermen did.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; The unlearned did. The poor had the
[1:25:09] gospel preached to them. I'm glad that
[1:25:11] we're poor, simple, humble people.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. God's people are
[1:25:17] humble people.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be preaching like this if we
[1:25:23] were in amongst a defied, refined, or
[1:25:26] dignified group of people. We We want We
[1:25:30] want it just the way it's spoken. Amen.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; And it may not fit the world, but in the
[1:25:36] last message, he said, "In things that
[1:25:38] are to be, your birth, your birth here
[1:25:42] was pre-planned." I assume you had a
[1:25:45] birth here someplace,
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; did you not?
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:25:52] it was pre-planned.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, you said, "Well, my mother conceived
[1:25:56] me." No, no, no. It was pre-planned long
[1:25:58] before that. That's right.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; God was setting out his building. His
[1:26:03] the contractors building the billies who
[1:26:05] puts all the material and the substance
[1:26:07] together. The substance the substance
[1:26:09] had to come and in the initial b in
[1:26:12] initial months you were just a twitching
[1:26:15] muscles and so on and so forth. But that
[1:26:18] God saw that substance coming together
[1:26:20] and your mother had to eat certain
[1:26:22] things to let a certain substance come
[1:26:25] and then you came into the world and God
[1:26:28] arranged that you would have a human
[1:26:30] spirit.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Then God even arranged that a prophet
[1:26:34] would be able to stand before giving the
[1:26:37] words from this unseen one would say now
[1:26:40] he's here.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[1:26:44] I take every spirit under my control for
[1:26:49] the glory of God. Do you believe that he
[1:26:52] took your spirit under control? And I
[1:26:55] say, "Oh God, come here this day and
[1:26:59] take our human spirits under control so
[1:27:02] that the Holy Ghost will have full
[1:27:05] control." Oh, this human spirit is so
[1:27:08] ugly. It's so at war with the Holy
[1:27:11] Spirit. Let the Holy Spirit come. Let
[1:27:14] all the figment of your imagination
[1:27:16] depart out of your mind and say what God
[1:27:20] has said and what his messenger said. I
[1:27:22] accept that.
[1:27:25] [Applause]
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; I want you to go out of this building
[1:27:28] today saying God planned me.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; I've been planned maybe hundreds of
[1:27:33] billions of years ago. God devised and
[1:27:37] God thought every aspect of me. He knew
[1:27:40] exactly who my parents would be and how
[1:27:43] I would come down the lineage of time
[1:27:46] and they would send a messenger that
[1:27:48] would say, "I see a girl.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; I see a life materializing.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; It's a girl."
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, and then she and then this some
[1:27:59] things have happened.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; There isn't a man. There isn't a woman
[1:28:05] here. But some things happened.
[1:28:09] Even you young people, some things
[1:28:11] happen.
[1:28:18] He knows all about it.
[1:28:22] There is no way out of the things that
[1:28:24] happen except his way.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; You leave it to him to sort out.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Some things happened. Some things
[1:28:34] happened to my kids. Some things
[1:28:36] happened to my wife. Something's
[1:28:38] happened to my husband. Something's
[1:28:40] happened in my life. Something's
[1:28:42] happened in my job. It cannot disturb or
[1:28:45] distress or derail a son or daughter of
[1:28:48] God.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Release your faith and paralyze the
[1:28:53] devil.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Are you prepared to do that?
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love to There's no there's nothing
[1:29:02] clean in him.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; There's no truth in him. So why don't we
[1:29:06] as sons and daughters of God paralyze
[1:29:09] the devil.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:27] Your birth was pre-planned.
[1:29:29] I guess you believe that everyone of
[1:29:32] everyone knows our birth was
[1:29:33] pre-planned.
[1:29:35] Your being here never originated just as
[1:29:38] a myth or a thought.
[1:29:40] Everything was all pre-planned by God
[1:29:42] before the foundation of the world. How
[1:29:45] he would just make a little statement.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; It's so profound and such depth there's
[1:29:50] no human mind can grasp it. But at least
[1:29:54] we believe it.
[1:29:57] Jesus said unto him, "Have I been so
[1:30:01] long time with you?" You've heard this.
[1:30:03] Now I'm going to be repeating some
[1:30:04] scripture. And yet hast thou not known
[1:30:07] me, Philillip? He that hath seen me hath
[1:30:10] seen the father.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; That's a statement
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; for a man who's just a
[1:30:17] by what the public thought a carpenter's
[1:30:19] son. And and if we were there, it would
[1:30:22] be it would be very very dangerous for
[1:30:25] to see for us to see him as a
[1:30:27] carpenter's son. But but it's it's one
[1:30:30] thing to read it in the Bible, but it's
[1:30:31] another thing to put yourself back there
[1:30:33] and say, "I would see him as a son of
[1:30:36] God." Would you
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; would you see him as a son of God? I'm
[1:30:40] asking some pointed questions because
[1:30:42] you need to ask yourself that today. Who
[1:30:45] am I saying?
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Who am I listening to? I'm hearing
[1:30:48] Brother Ed. Are you?
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm hearing Brother Tom or Brother
[1:30:52] John or Brother Brother Tim. I'm I'm
[1:30:55] hearing maybe I'm hearing somebody else.
[1:30:58] in the family.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; It might just be that God's speaking.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; That God's urging you.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Believest thou not that I am come. I am
[1:31:18] in the Father and the Father in me. The
[1:31:22] words that I speak unto you, I speak not
[1:31:25] of myself, but the Father that dwelleth
[1:31:28] in me. He doeth the works.
[1:31:36] Now, you're a mature congregation. I
[1:31:38] have some things to say.
[1:31:42] I will go into the Old Testament
[1:31:45] in the book of Exodus.
[1:31:48] Follow this very close now because it
[1:31:50] has to do even in the building you're
[1:31:53] sitting in. In the book of Exodus, God
[1:31:56] spoke to Moses and said, "Have the
[1:31:59] people build build me a sanctuary,
[1:32:04] and you'll do it this way, and you'll
[1:32:06] have staves, and you'll have poles, and
[1:32:08] you'll have sockets, you'll have silver,
[1:32:12] then you'll have a holy of holies,
[1:32:14] you'll have skins of goats,
[1:32:17] all of these things. And you'll build
[1:32:19] build me the sanctuary." I'll never
[1:32:21] forget a brother that came up and I
[1:32:22] think preached right behind this pulpit
[1:32:24] and said that when the nations around
[1:32:26] maybe came over the hill and said, "What
[1:32:29] what's that?
[1:32:34] What what's that structure?"
[1:32:36] And then you as an Israelite would say,
[1:32:38] "Well, that's where our God lives."
[1:32:42] Really?
[1:32:44] Come on.
[1:32:49] What was the difference when a little
[1:32:51] lad,
[1:32:53] little boy with a bad reputation,
[1:32:58] his mom was pregnant with him when she
[1:33:01] was just a teenager.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; That's all they knew.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; And that was true.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; But that's all they knew.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; They didn't know the background. They
[1:33:12] didn't know that this boy's father saw
[1:33:17] this substance coming together hundreds
[1:33:19] of billions of years ago.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; This was going to be the redemption.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to deal with sin.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring the killing blow to
[1:33:28] the devil.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; I'm going to crush the head of the
[1:33:31] serpent.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; All of this. No wonder he was rejoicing
[1:33:34] just watching over that son. You think
[1:33:36] he'd let anything happen to him? Not a
[1:33:39] chance. You think he'd let anything
[1:33:41] happen to you and I as believers? Not a
[1:33:43] chance.
[1:33:44] [Applause]
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Rise up, saints of God. Paralyze the
[1:33:50] devil.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; He's a liar from the beginning, and he
[1:33:53] has no truth in him.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; And here come
[1:34:03] here come this man.
[1:34:06] He got cold. He got hungry.
[1:34:09] He wept.
[1:34:11] He sweat when he was hot. He got tired.
[1:34:14] He went to sleep in a boat.
[1:34:17] Say, "Who who is this?" Oh, they don't
[1:34:21] say, "Oh, that's my Jesus." No, that
[1:34:24] isn't what they were saying. This is
[1:34:25] This is a young prophet.
[1:34:28] Prophet? Really? Well, not only that, we
[1:34:32] believe the scripture
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; says that he's God in flesh.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; God in flesh. Oh my goodness. They
[1:34:40] couldn't they couldn't they couldn't
[1:34:42] handle that.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; But when he was turning bread into he's
[1:34:47] turning cook bread and feeding the
[1:34:50] people and they were taking up baskets
[1:34:52] and baskets more. Am I making this real
[1:34:55] to you? They said, "Wouldn't he make a
[1:34:58] great king?"
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We want him to be a king. So they
[1:35:02] were but they were seeing the evidence
[1:35:04] of the unseen. some evidence they liked,
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; But when he started saying, "I and my
[1:35:11] father are one." So, we don't like that
[1:35:14] evidence. We don't like wherever that
[1:35:16] come from. We don't agree with that.
[1:35:20] And so, the same people who were crying,
[1:35:23] "Let's make him a king. Let's make him a
[1:35:25] king." One week later, they're saying,
[1:35:27] "Crucify him. Crucify him. Crucify him."
[1:35:32] Why? Because the evidence was condemning
[1:35:34] them.
[1:35:38] On one side, you'll be oh, the greatest
[1:35:41] person in the country. You're the
[1:35:43] greatest neighbor. You're the greatest
[1:35:45] friend. But then something happens and
[1:35:48] you don't even know why, but they're
[1:35:50] absolutely opposed to you.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; I've actually encountered people that
[1:35:56] hate me before they know me.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Do you know why? the spirit that's in
[1:36:01] them is in opposition is an enemy to the
[1:36:04] spirit that's in me. And I realize that
[1:36:07] I have the Holy Ghost.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; I have the spirit of God.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; He's a friend to some, but he's an enemy
[1:36:13] to others.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; And at one time they want to make you
[1:36:17] the greatest person in the world. And
[1:36:19] the next time they're gone.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; You're a nice congregation.
[1:36:31] Someday I won't be preaching here
[1:36:32] probably,
[1:36:34] but I want you to listen to this.
[1:36:37] Some of those that made they were making
[1:36:40] the temple and they were skilled and
[1:36:43] they were making the tabernacle.
[1:36:46] Are you listening?
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; And they were working, giving their work
[1:36:51] and they maybe gave their money and they
[1:36:54] worked and they build they build this
[1:36:56] tabernacle.
[1:36:58] But then, you know, they didn't want to
[1:36:59] take it all
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; and they died in the wilderness.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; And Jesus, who was speaking on behalf of
[1:37:08] God, later on said, "They're dead.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; They've died."
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; You know, friends, I'm glad I can say
[1:37:16] it's not my words, it's his words.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; But they built the place that God was
[1:37:22] even going to dwell in. And And were
[1:37:24] they lost? No, I don't say that they
[1:37:26] were that I I have no place. It's it's
[1:37:29] God who gave life and God who does
[1:37:31] whatever he wants to do, but God saw
[1:37:34] that people would be that that some
[1:37:37] would You're kind of getting quiet on
[1:37:39] me.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; He saw that some would be engaged in his
[1:37:44] work and then later on would for I don't
[1:37:47] know for whatever reason they're engaged
[1:37:49] in the work, but at later on at some
[1:37:52] point in time say it's not for me. I
[1:37:54] guess there's just a stage of my life
[1:37:56] I'm out of here.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; But then there's others
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; that say, you know what? I'm going to
[1:38:05] sit in this building and enjoy it.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say,
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go into this temple,
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; these boys that died in the wilderness.
[1:38:16] I still believe what the prophet Moses
[1:38:18] has said. And I'm still going to go in
[1:38:20] there and I'm going to stand in the
[1:38:22] court and I'm going to worship God. I
[1:38:25] don't care what happened to them.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; I don't care what they said. I don't
[1:38:31] care what they said about m what Miriam
[1:38:33] said Moses or about his wife or what
[1:38:36] they said about anything. I don't care
[1:38:38] what they said. I'm going to go. I still
[1:38:41] believe that some mercy seats in there.
[1:38:44] I still believe the Sakina is in there.
[1:38:46] I still believe it. Do you believe it?
[1:38:52] [Music]
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; I thought of a skilled people. God
[1:39:04] brings skilled people to do different
[1:39:07] things.
[1:39:09] God allows
[1:39:11] Well, I don't know.
[1:39:15] I'm afraid to ask this question, but
[1:39:17] there's a good side to I guess
[1:39:19] computers. I I
[1:39:22] I did all this work on a computer and
[1:39:25] I'm very glad that I have a computer
[1:39:28] because I can rub out my mistakes and I
[1:39:30] can highlight stuff and and it helps me
[1:39:32] along. And you say, "Well,
[1:39:36] I see I see you smiling there, Brother
[1:39:39] Darren. Brother Kyle, it's all right.
[1:39:42] You didn't smile. I I might be the old
[1:39:44] house but any the old class but
[1:39:46] nevertheless it's it does help me. So I
[1:39:50] think it's all right and and I have to
[1:39:52] think did God know that Bill Gates was
[1:39:55] going to be who Bill Gates is? And did
[1:39:57] he know that Steve Jobs was going to be
[1:39:59] what he's going to be? And did he know
[1:40:02] about Apple? Did he know about
[1:40:03] Blackberry? Did he know about all these
[1:40:05] computers and all this age? He know all
[1:40:07] about Did he know all about this texting
[1:40:09] and all about this social media? Does he
[1:40:12] know all about that? Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[1:40:14] That's old stuff. He said, he said,
[1:40:16] "Well, one day you're going to travel
[1:40:17] like a thought."
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; How's that?
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Just have them plug that into their
[1:40:25] machine and see how that's going to
[1:40:26] work. Have them figure that one out.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:36] I went to a symposium that was at the
[1:40:39] World Fair and uh they were talking
[1:40:42] about technology that's just ahead and
[1:40:44] they said uh
[1:40:47] okay what's in the future for us? They
[1:40:50] said well how would you like to go down
[1:40:52] the street and know what's in the next
[1:40:53] person's mind?
[1:40:56] And they wanted you just to push a
[1:40:57] button.
[1:40:59] I never pushed a button. I said, "I have
[1:41:01] enough trouble with my own mind. Let let
[1:41:04] alone worry about the in this guy's
[1:41:05] mind." They said, "That's a that's
[1:41:08] technology that's coming. It's coming.
[1:41:11] You'll just walk down the street and
[1:41:12] you'll know what he's thinking. You know
[1:41:13] what they're thinking." And I said,
[1:41:15] "Well,
[1:41:18] I had a prophet that knew what people
[1:41:19] were thinking.
[1:41:21] I'll let it go through that prophet
[1:41:23] filter. I haven't got the filter to
[1:41:25] handle all of this. I don't care where
[1:41:27] they go. You know, someday you're going
[1:41:29] to laugh at maybe the ads that they have
[1:41:31] today. You'll maybe laugh at them the
[1:41:34] way like I do when I I see some of the
[1:41:36] cars of the 50s for 600 bucks.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Wow. I'd like to buy a few of those.
[1:41:50] Does this all make some sense to you?
[1:41:56] I'm here today to try to convey to you
[1:42:00] that you are the substance that God has
[1:42:03] been preparing
[1:42:05] for a long time.
[1:42:09] And it's important for you, each one of
[1:42:12] you. There's nobody that's highly
[1:42:14] visible and nobody that's invisible.
[1:42:17] They're just everybody's important.
[1:42:20] When a prophet can say, "I'm just a man.
[1:42:24] I'm as helpless as can be." But when the
[1:42:27] angel of the Lord comes, I'm the voice
[1:42:29] of God to you.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Now, that is something that every
[1:42:33] believer needs to discover.
[1:42:48] So God said about the tabernacle.
[1:42:52] It's it'll have them build a place so I
[1:42:56] can dwell amongst them.
[1:42:59] But he also said that
[1:43:02] I won't be only with them but I want to
[1:43:05] be in them.
[1:43:09] Now just give me a moment because I
[1:43:11] there are some scriptures and some
[1:43:13] quotes that I want to use.
[1:43:17] I will dwell amongst them.
[1:43:22] uh know you know here's here just some
[1:43:25] scriptures for Romans 8:9 says but you
[1:43:29] are not in the flesh but in the spirit
[1:43:30] if so be that the spirit of God dwells
[1:43:35] in you I was really trying to absorb
[1:43:40] these
[1:43:42] phrases the spirit of God I I begin to
[1:43:44] think about what's it mean for the
[1:43:47] spirit of God to actually dwell in me
[1:43:51] and then other scriptures.
[1:43:54] But if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:43:56] Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he
[1:43:59] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:44:01] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:44:04] his spirit that dwelleth in you. So now
[1:44:08] the Holy Ghost and then Paul said in in
[1:44:12] Colossians, even the mystery which hath
[1:44:16] been hid.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hello church.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Paul is speaking about a mystery. It's
[1:44:22] been hid
[1:44:24] has been hid
[1:44:28] from the ages and from generations
[1:44:32] but now
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; is made manifest to his saints. Is that
[1:44:37] so?
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; And I say this to you. You need to say
[1:44:44] whether you feel it or whether some
[1:44:47] sparkling thing has happened or not
[1:44:50] happened, you need to say no that's
[1:44:52] true.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; These things that have been hid, these
[1:44:55] secrets that have been hid through the
[1:44:57] ages have been made known. And if it
[1:45:01] takes me with my education, limited
[1:45:04] education or your higher education to
[1:45:07] search out this message and find out,
[1:45:09] you know, you know the the the little
[1:45:11] quote that I was just giving you, I I
[1:45:14] see a life materializing.
[1:45:17] Put that one in your script bag.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Figure that one out. Get somebody to try
[1:45:24] to explain that to you. Nobody.
[1:45:28] What what kind of prophet do you have?
[1:45:31] Did Muhammad ever say that?
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Did Joseph Smith ever say that?
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Head of the Mormon people or head of the
[1:45:40] Islamic people? Was there ever a prophet
[1:45:43] that says, "I see a life materializing.
[1:45:50] This is why you're here.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; You have some connection to this."
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:55] That's right.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Say, I I I have a I have a prophet sent
[1:45:59] from God.
[1:46:01] Saw life materializing. This was done.
[1:46:04] Now I'm coming down. Have I still got a
[1:46:06] few minutes a time? I'm coming down.
[1:46:11] And the prophet in the in the message,
[1:46:14] the proof of the resurrection.
[1:46:18] That was in 54.
[1:46:22] But in 10 years later, 10 years of
[1:46:26] evidence, 10 years of proof,
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; 10 years, I will say, of infallible
[1:46:32] proofs,
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; constantly saying, "Is that the truth?
[1:46:36] Is that the truth?" If that's the truth,
[1:46:39] raise your hand. Is that the truth?
[1:46:41] Never once did anyone say, "No, it's not
[1:46:45] true."
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? And then they try
[1:46:48] to um put this messenger, put this
[1:46:50] prophet and align them up with somebody
[1:46:52] else's on television. And that's
[1:46:55] absolute trash.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; As phony as it can be.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; I say don't put my messenger, don't put
[1:47:04] the one sent from God to me in that
[1:47:07] category.
[1:47:08] [Applause]
[1:47:13] And in 10 years, 10 years from
[1:47:19] 54.
[1:47:25] Here are just some phrases as we go
[1:47:27] along.
[1:47:31] In 53,
[1:47:33] I'm moving up quickly now. Now he says
[1:47:36] to somebody, "Now that won't hurt you."
[1:47:42] Hey, there's ministers like these
[1:47:43] ministers. There's scholars. There's
[1:47:46] doctors of divinity.
[1:47:49] And here here's a man with hardly any
[1:47:51] education. But he's got to he so
[1:47:54] believes in his in his mission and his
[1:47:58] commission
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; to the people
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; that he's telling educated people with
[1:48:04] all of the scholars and educated around
[1:48:08] saying now this one that is here now
[1:48:13] and he tells the person that won't hurt
[1:48:15] you
[1:48:20] that's the angel of the Lord
[1:48:24] It's the angel of the Lord, his
[1:48:26] presence.
[1:48:29] Now, do you believe that God the Father
[1:48:31] hath sent his son Jesus
[1:48:35] and he sent me as his prophet?
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; If I shall ask God, will you be healed?
[1:48:44] Will your baby get well?
[1:48:46] Come here.
[1:48:51] What is it? You say, "Why are you
[1:48:53] reading that?" That's evidence.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be coming here.
[1:49:01] Just put the last slide up, would you
[1:49:04] please, for me?
[1:49:24] 10 years later, he preaches the trial.
[1:49:31] Now, we're having a real trial.
[1:49:35] The case is the word of God, the word of
[1:49:38] God's promises versus the world. That's
[1:49:41] the case.
[1:49:45] The indictment is a breach of promise.
[1:49:51] The prosecuting attorney is Satan and he
[1:49:54] represents the world in this trial. The
[1:49:57] defendant is God.
[1:50:01] The defense witness is the Holy Ghost.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:09] So I want to make the church, the
[1:50:12] congregation
[1:50:13] both jury and judge.
[1:50:19] So you have to make a decision.
[1:50:23] As a jury and judge,
[1:50:26] how is the evidence to you?
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Now, here's one. during this 10 years
[1:50:35] he's saying
[1:50:37] now that won't hurt you said well I'
[1:50:39] I've heard that before no
[1:50:42] that won't hurt you is talking to people
[1:50:45] if you were standing here in other words
[1:50:48] would you be willing you'd be walking
[1:50:50] into something
[1:50:52] oh
[1:50:56] you might be like the woman you ladies
[1:50:57] might be like the woman in deep calls
[1:51:00] the deep she puts her hand on the pulpit
[1:51:02] to study yourself. Now, that won't hurt
[1:51:05] you. How do you like to be brother Ed
[1:51:07] Biscll driving along in a car?
[1:51:13] And
[1:51:15] do you think that this could be Elijah
[1:51:17] the prophet as it's foretold in the
[1:51:20] scripture and so on and revelation and
[1:51:24] so on?
[1:51:26] Well, I don't know. For all I know,
[1:51:28] brother Brandham, it must be. It has
[1:51:30] every appearance of being.
[1:51:35] And he says, "Now he's a man. I often
[1:51:39] kind of wondered. I kind of think so
[1:51:40] myself." And then from some unseen
[1:51:43] place.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; I thought instantly I thought, "I'm
[1:51:49] going to die. I'm I'm passing out of
[1:51:52] here." I didn't see anything with my
[1:51:54] eyes. Far more real than your eyes. Your
[1:51:56] eyes play tricks on you. I can take my
[1:51:59] glasses off and you all look different
[1:52:02] at eyes. Don't worry about eyes.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; I was frozen. I was frozen.
[1:52:11] I looked at him.
[1:52:13] He lost all the color in his face. His
[1:52:16] beard was prickled out like a man that
[1:52:18] was near death.
[1:52:20] Rolled his head back and kind of just
[1:52:22] glanced over with his eyes.
[1:52:26] said, "Brother Eddie, I guess he's come
[1:52:28] to me 10,000 times 10,000."
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; And it's just every time the same. It's
[1:52:34] like I could die.
[1:52:39] But would you would you like to be
[1:52:40] there? No, you wouldn't want to be
[1:52:42] there.
[1:52:45] You say, "Well, was there a fear?" Yeah.
[1:52:47] It was a great fear of reverence. He
[1:52:49] said every time he comes, he says, "Fear
[1:52:53] not.
[1:52:56] Friends, I'm talking about a holiness.
[1:52:58] I'm talking about a goddess such majesty
[1:53:02] that for the worms of the earth such as
[1:53:05] we are, it's a unspeakable
[1:53:08] honor that this God would call us.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; But he called us because he loved us.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; He called us because he had a program
[1:53:17] for us. He's brought you here because
[1:53:20] there's some specific way. He didn't
[1:53:22] bring you here because this is a nice
[1:53:24] place to live or Canada is a good place
[1:53:26] for you that have immigrated here.
[1:53:28] That's not the program. That's not the
[1:53:31] program. That I say again, that's not
[1:53:34] the program. You're here to be a
[1:53:36] blessing to the bride of Christ. You're
[1:53:39] here because God has ordained it. You're
[1:53:42] here because you needed to hear this
[1:53:44] service.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; You need to ponder it. You need to go
[1:53:48] home. You need to think deep about these
[1:53:50] things. You need to realize that
[1:53:53] someday, and it may not be too long,
[1:53:55] before you and I are called out of this
[1:53:59] life.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Maybe me sooner than you, maybe you
[1:54:03] sooner than me.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Then what?
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Then what?
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; And people there gathered around you and
[1:54:16] you're on a cold slab. And then what?
[1:54:20] You're in the presence of God. You're in
[1:54:22] the very presence of this one I'm
[1:54:24] seeking to make a reality to you today.
[1:54:27] And what you need to say is, "Oh God,
[1:54:29] open my heart. Open my mind. Open my
[1:54:33] soul to you, oh father."
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say that?
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:48] You're aware right now
[1:54:51] that you're standing in the presence of
[1:54:53] something besides a man. I believe I'm
[1:54:56] not just reading some words. I believe
[1:54:59] there's people that are here. You're
[1:55:01] seated in this. You say, "This is
[1:55:03] different." You're right.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; It is different.
[1:55:10] God is speaking. God is desiring to
[1:55:13] bring you into a special understanding
[1:55:15] and a special relationship with him.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; It's not just some words. Our father
[1:55:21] which art in heaven but our father. Oh
[1:55:25] father.
[1:55:26] Father the way Jesus said it. The father
[1:55:29] acts the father works and so the son
[1:55:32] does likewise. You ladies can say the
[1:55:35] father acts. The father has desires. So
[1:55:39] the daughter does likewise. I'm here to
[1:55:42] fulfill what the word of God says about
[1:55:45] me. I'm here to fulfill God's word. God
[1:55:49] had a program, a divine program. Listen
[1:55:52] friends,
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; when I think of
[1:55:57] how God has has designed this
[1:56:02] whole thing.
[1:56:04] I I was awakened quite early and I was
[1:56:07] thinking
[1:56:17] I was thinking of how God led
[1:56:20] has led us.
[1:56:26] He has done
[1:56:29] he has done these things.
[1:56:34] Some of you come from Blaine or come
[1:56:36] from Lynon come from I'm not talking
[1:56:39] talking about I don't want to talk about
[1:56:41] the Old Testament or the New Testament.
[1:56:43] I want to talk about here just before
[1:56:46] closing
[1:56:49] live at Birch Bay Seattle Tacoma.
[1:56:56] There's Vancouver over here, two and a
[1:56:58] half million people.
[1:57:02] So, we've gathered from a lot of
[1:57:04] different places.
[1:57:05] Brother John, I was talking to your son
[1:57:08] said, "How long you been here?" He said,
[1:57:10] "16 years in a few months."
[1:57:13] Brother Tammy, you came down.
[1:57:17] Brother Tom, how God called you.
[1:57:24] Did they come to a decision or did God
[1:57:26] do this?
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; You are sitting where you're sitting.
[1:57:31] Say, "Well, why are you here?" Well, I'm
[1:57:33] here because my parents are here. Is
[1:57:36] that why you're here? Really?
[1:57:40] I'm here because my my parents moved
[1:57:44] here.
[1:57:46] Is that it or is it God?
[1:57:50] You're going to have to move away from
[1:57:51] your parent
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; and determine
[1:57:55] God hath done this,
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Then you'll get into another channel.
[1:58:01] You'll get into God had a plan.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; How did you get here, Brother Jean?
[1:58:09] How do you get hooked up with
[1:58:12] Sister Angelica? Angelica.
[1:58:15] Did I say that right? Fairly close.
[1:58:20] and your dad, brother Daniel, mom,
[1:58:23] coming from Nigeria.
[1:58:27] How How did this happen?
[1:58:33] Now, here's some things you don't know.
[1:58:37] Cloverdale. Where's Cloverdale?
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says, "What's
[1:58:41] Jeffersonville?"
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Dark Hellhole.
[1:58:47] What is it? He said it's a Nazareth.
[1:58:50] It's it's it's the reject of the of the
[1:58:53] rejects. What's Cloverdale? We used to
[1:58:56] call it Clover Gouch. There was nothing
[1:58:59] here. Racetrack.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Right behind the house.
[1:59:05] And God knew that in that house would be
[1:59:10] people that would come to know him.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; And there come a big tall
[1:59:16] Ellie, where are you?
[1:59:21] Stand up, Ellie. Just for a moment.
[1:59:26] Fell about this tall.
[1:59:28] 6 foot. He was 6'5, 6'6. Is that
[1:59:31] somewhere? All right. Okay. Sit down.
[1:59:35] He was imposing. He talked to my
[1:59:37] daughter. Marilyn, do you want to stand
[1:59:39] up?
[1:59:42] Okay. somebody 6'6 talking to her about
[1:59:45] 5'5 at school making fun of uh the house
[1:59:50] a house you gather Bible way house.
[1:59:52] Yeah.
[1:59:54] And I said you tell him he's a chicken
[1:59:59] and he's he's scared to come there. So
[2:00:02] you know what he did? He got tanked up.
[2:00:05] He got tanked up. Who's doing all this?
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; God doeth it.
[2:00:12] And he comes to the house and there's a
[2:00:14] little hedge and he's weaving around,
[2:00:16] you know, he's trying to get up enough
[2:00:19] boldness to come in and he falls over
[2:00:21] the hedge right into the yard. Do you
[2:00:25] know what he was? You know what he he
[2:00:27] had a super mind. You know what he did?
[2:00:30] Four and a half years cleaning Brother
[2:00:34] Benham's messages
[2:00:36] because he was a electronic genius.
[2:00:41] You think when he was weaving
[2:00:43] drunk
[2:00:46] these strange people here
[2:00:50] falls over. Do you think he was saying
[2:00:52] glory to God I'm going to be cleaning
[2:00:54] the tapes?
[2:00:56] No. God was saying
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; get up you slug. You're going to clean
[2:01:01] the tapes.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; I am.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he four and a half years in a
[2:01:06] little wee place
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; and he cleaned tapes and they made
[2:01:11] libraries and sent them all over the
[2:01:13] world.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Can you folks take just a little bit of
[2:01:18] history?
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; A history that right down to where you
[2:01:22] are, please. from a few young people in
[2:01:25] a house to a log church over 8,000
[2:01:31] half-hour programs on the radio. That's
[2:01:34] where the name Bible believers came
[2:01:36] from. It was the Bible believers
[2:01:38] broadcast on as many as 27 stations from
[2:01:44] Africa to Hawaii and across the United
[2:01:47] States and Canada. four and a half years
[2:01:50] of filtering the tapes, we manufactured.
[2:01:56] We were a handful of people. We actually
[2:01:58] manufactured cassettes. How many don't
[2:02:01] know what a cassette is?
[2:02:04] Everybody knows what a cassette is.
[2:02:08] A little cassette.
[2:02:11] And the man who is making the cassettes
[2:02:16] doesn't know whether he believes the
[2:02:18] message now or not.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Does that stop somebody from hearing it?
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Not a bit.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Do you get my point?
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; People may have labored. People may have
[2:02:36] worked. People may have produced tapes
[2:02:39] or books. They printed several millions
[2:02:42] in in India. I don't know where the
[2:02:44] people are. I don't know where the
[2:02:46] people are that were running the
[2:02:48] presses. I don't care where they are. I
[2:02:50] know where the books have gone. I know
[2:02:52] where the messages have gone and
[2:02:54] churches have sprung up.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; You know how
[2:03:06] what do I say?
[2:03:09] He doeth the works.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do. God was going to
[2:03:13] do it anyway.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; We're just so privileged we were able to
[2:03:17] be a part of it. So so privileged.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; And then we go on from there. I have to
[2:03:23] go on just quickly for a moment.
[2:03:26] And then the messages went on to discs.
[2:03:30] And then it went on to a message hub.
[2:03:33] And God brings people that can be
[2:03:37] skilled in certain things and connected
[2:03:40] in a certain way when we need to make a
[2:03:43] make uh the cassettes. I just had it in
[2:03:48] my heart. This is this is God's profit
[2:03:52] and we need the best quality there is.
[2:03:55] Do you know it just so happened?
[2:03:58] You know what happened, friends? None of
[2:04:00] you know. I'm going to tell you
[2:04:02] something. You're going to hear for the
[2:04:03] first time.
[2:04:04] God arranged
[2:04:07] that the president of Sony here in
[2:04:11] Canada
[2:04:13] of all the countries that Sony Sony had
[2:04:18] their products all over the world. They
[2:04:20] never gave it to any local people. But
[2:04:24] they gave it to a Jewish family called
[2:04:27] Cohen family. And when God had arranged
[2:04:30] that I would be in some old dirty
[2:04:33] building downtown
[2:04:35] selling some auction stuff,
[2:04:38] the president of Sony liked to get
[2:04:42] diamonds.
[2:04:43] And when he'd find a good diamond or
[2:04:46] some expensive jewelry and he'd come in,
[2:04:49] I got very well connected with him. Now
[2:04:52] years later, we're here. Well, I have a
[2:04:54] whole different reason. I I'm I'm
[2:04:57] attached to a message. I don't know what
[2:04:58] he's attached to. He became a very, very
[2:05:01] wealthy man. The whole family became
[2:05:03] very, very wealthy. But I called him up.
[2:05:06] I said, "We need tapes." He said, "Well,
[2:05:08] come on down." So I came down. They gave
[2:05:11] us all the equipment we wanted. We gave
[2:05:13] us the best tapes that could be had,
[2:05:15] Sony tape. And I thought, "This is just
[2:05:18] wonderful here. God puts a connection
[2:05:20] together out in the world someplace." Do
[2:05:23] you think that took God by surprise? Not
[2:05:25] for a moment. And he has those tapes and
[2:05:28] he has the best tape that there is. And
[2:05:30] and and and here we here we have bunch
[2:05:32] of young people and they're working
[2:05:35] manufacturing them from the big pancakes
[2:05:38] making tapes. You say why were we making
[2:05:40] them? Because some some of the messages
[2:05:42] were like 75 minutes and there's nothing
[2:05:45] from 60 minutes to 90. And so we didn't
[2:05:48] want to throw away 15 minutes of tape.
[2:05:51] So we made them as long as the service
[2:05:54] was and we manufactured one year alone
[2:05:56] they manufactured 98,000.
[2:06:00] The person who was making the tapes
[2:06:02] gone.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; The tape's not gone. He's gone.
[2:06:08] People worked in this building gone.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm here enjoying it.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Come on folks. Yeah.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Well, some of my friends Oh, no. Listen.
[2:06:23] The reason why you're here is not
[2:06:25] because it's a building.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; You're not here because it's
[2:06:28] comfortable. You're here because God
[2:06:31] called you.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; And that's the only reason you're here.
[2:06:34] Is that the truth? Say amen.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; God spoke.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; God called you.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; And this might have been in his mind
[2:06:43] hundred billion years ago. I'm going to
[2:06:47] bring some substance. I'm going to
[2:06:49] create substance. I'm making them. I'm
[2:06:52] making this child. I'm making a boy. I'm
[2:06:55] making a girl. I'll even send a
[2:06:57] messenger and and he'll stand in front
[2:06:59] of the people for years and give
[2:07:02] evidence of the unseen. He'll give
[2:07:04] evidence of me
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; and I'll come so close. I'll stand on
[2:07:09] the platform. They'll be nervous when
[2:07:12] they come into my presence. They will
[2:07:14] know that what he's saying is the truth.
[2:07:17] And he'll ask, "Is this the truth? Is
[2:07:19] this the truth?" And they will say,
[2:07:20] "Yes, yes, it's the truth. It can only
[2:07:23] be truth because God is truth."
[2:07:26] [Music]
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; And after 10 years, I'll have him speak
[2:07:31] the trial.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; I'll allow myself to be the defendant.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; I'll be put on trial by Mr. Skeptic,
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; by Mr. Unbeliever, and Mr. Impatience.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:45] And I'll have my officer
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; there. Glory to God. I'll have my
[2:07:51] validated, vindicated servant there.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he'll speak on my behalf.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You can see I'm having trouble
[2:08:04] getting done.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; It will bring me right down to this
[2:08:09] time. Amen.
[2:08:12] I don't necessarily want to mention
[2:08:14] people but on the other hand I have a
[2:08:16] great difficulty not we need to build a
[2:08:19] building and so we need certain skilled
[2:08:21] people where they are today I don't know
[2:08:24] we need to build a school I'll tell you
[2:08:26] what if if brother and I've told brother
[2:08:28] Kim Dingwall and I say it without any
[2:08:31] hesitation if God hadn't sent him here
[2:08:34] we wouldn't have the present building
[2:08:35] that we have and you teachers that God
[2:08:38] has put it in your heart to be there let
[2:08:40] it be known to you that this service
[2:08:42] today, that this message today, and this
[2:08:46] is not some poetic license. God saw
[2:08:48] before the foundation of the world, that
[2:08:51] this substance was going to come and
[2:08:52] teach our children. And I tell you, our
[2:08:55] children are jewels. Our children are
[2:08:58] the crop, cream of the crop.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; And they're going to have a Holy Ghost.
[2:09:02] That's why you need the Holy Spirit and
[2:09:04] a principle such as Brother Tatch. I
[2:09:07] say, "Oh God, how gracious you are."
[2:09:11] Listen, friends,
[2:09:13] I'm not talking about Cloverdale, by the
[2:09:14] way. I'm saying he doeth the work.
[2:09:21] [Music]
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Have you ever been begged and begged and
[2:09:25] begged for your money? No. Why? Because
[2:09:28] he doeth the works.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; And if it's his works, it's his account.
[2:09:33] It's his bills.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; He has to pay for it.
[2:09:44] And as you sit here today, there's a
[2:09:47] brother, a young man, maybe 30.
[2:09:52] How old is brother Bus?
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; He's 30. Just under 30, 29.
[2:10:01] He's got two little babies
[2:10:03] and his wife is way in Uganda.
[2:10:06] and he's left her so he can be there.
[2:10:11] You talk about sacrifice
[2:10:16] and has the first first and only message
[2:10:21] church in the nation of Ethiopia and
[2:10:24] that God would allow this church
[2:10:29] and somehow a burden and a vision and
[2:10:32] brother Tim has that burden and vision.
[2:10:35] This church has that burden and vision.
[2:10:38] Brother Tom has that burden and vision.
[2:10:41] Brother John has traveled to speak. Why?
[2:10:44] Not because we're building another
[2:10:45] earthly kingdom, but because there's a
[2:10:48] God hundreds of billions of years ago.
[2:10:50] Brother John, this was in God's mind.
[2:10:53] And he says, "I'm going to give evidence
[2:10:55] and I'm going to let people see the
[2:10:57] evidence." And there'll be some that'll
[2:10:59] see the evidence and say, "Praise God,
[2:11:02] it justifies me." And another person
[2:11:04] will see the evidence and they'll say,
[2:11:05] "I don't like that evidence. It condemns
[2:11:08] me. So be it.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; So be it.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; If a person did wrong, make it right.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; Make it right the right way.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; You know, we're not here to just say a
[2:11:26] bunch of flowery words.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Sister Billisburg.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; You called me.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Said, "I want to make it right."
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She sits here, we give her
[2:11:38] the right hand of fellowship.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; We're not here to play games. We're here
[2:11:42] to know who we are
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; and why God has called us and what we're
[2:11:47] here to do. We're not here in our
[2:11:49] business. We're here on his business.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; He doeth the work.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; He's the one who paid the price. He's
[2:11:56] the one who gave the sacrifice.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; We all were sinners.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; We're all no good. There's nothing good
[2:12:04] in us.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; We're nothing more. As the prophet said,
[2:12:08] "I'm nothing more than the water of
[2:12:10] Bethesda
[2:12:11] after the angel of the Lord left.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; We're just humans."
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; But I tell you what, he said, "I will
[2:12:18] never leave you.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; I will never I will never forsake you."
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; And we've had camps. And how I thank God
[2:12:27] for Brother Derek and Sister Debbie. And
[2:12:30] and it's not enough just to mention
[2:12:32] names and say how we thank them. I was
[2:12:34] thinking of you, brother Milco. I was
[2:12:36] thinking of all the other people and
[2:12:38] brother Darren and those and the unsung
[2:12:41] heroes. What about the trustees? And
[2:12:44] what about the deacons after many hours
[2:12:46] after the meeting's over? What about
[2:12:49] people that go out and witness and
[2:12:51] brother brother Matthew Redell gathering
[2:12:54] up the young people to go to the streets
[2:12:57] and put together uh whatever tracks and
[2:13:02] so on so forth.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; You'll never regret it.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; You'll never regret it.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; You may not do it the way we did. We're
[2:13:16] lucky some of our boys weren't in jail,
[2:13:20] but they were doing it out of their
[2:13:22] heart.
[2:13:26] Is that right, Brother Tom? Lucky
[2:13:29] they're not in jail.
[2:13:31] You know what I mean?
[2:13:34] Cuz they go down the street.
[2:13:37] What are you baptized unto if you
[2:13:39] weren't baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:13:40] Jesus Christ? I don't know what they
[2:13:42] said after that.
[2:13:44] Maybe maybe not repeat it. How were you
[2:13:46] baptized? What city did you come from?
[2:13:50] I was on an airplane and there was a
[2:13:53] movie that was being shot in Vancouver.
[2:13:57] I didn't have any headset, of course,
[2:14:00] but I see where the camera's going and
[2:14:02] they pan right by
[2:14:06] uh our our our trailer
[2:14:10] and we said, "You know what? People will
[2:14:12] be so tired of walking this midway of
[2:14:16] the P& they're going to be aching for a
[2:14:18] place to sit down. I said, "Let's get a
[2:14:21] trailer and put seats in it so they can
[2:14:23] sit down." See you smiling by the mic.
[2:14:28] Hallelujah.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; Because we don't have time for
[2:14:32] individual testimonies. I'm testifying.
[2:14:34] So people came in and sat down. And what
[2:14:36] did we have playing? Deep calls the
[2:14:38] deep. Deep calls the deep.
[2:14:43] Hallelujah.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; A little woman came up.
[2:14:50] Actually, my daughter Marilyn went down
[2:14:52] to one of the one of the barns. Isn't
[2:14:56] this typical? Isn't this typical?
[2:14:59] Isn't this typical? No.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Went down to one of the barns
[2:15:05] and there's a little wash lady in there
[2:15:09] cleaning the washroom
[2:15:11] and that wash lady says to her, "You're
[2:15:14] one of the young people from up at that
[2:15:16] booth, aren't you?" Is up on the hill.
[2:15:20] And she said, "Yes." She said, "You got
[2:15:22] something and I want it."
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; You know whose mother that was? Sister
[2:15:27] Violet, why don't you stand up?
[2:15:31] Sister Violet Law's mother.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; And because of her mother who's passed
[2:15:38] away, Sister Violet at 19 years old,
[2:15:44] gave her life to Christ.
[2:15:49] And then you had a friend. You may not
[2:15:51] remember this, but I do. You remember
[2:15:53] it? Violet had a friend.
[2:15:58] Friend.
[2:16:00] Oh, the friends can be so dangerous.
[2:16:03] She had a friend out here someplace in
[2:16:05] the valley, I think it was, was pulling
[2:16:07] on her real strong and she was just
[2:16:10] about ready to give up. Brother Nathan,
[2:16:12] she's about ready to give up. And I
[2:16:15] remember the day we knelt at a chair and
[2:16:18] I spoke with her and she prayed through
[2:16:21] and has never moved ever since. Amen.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; You see brother Ken Ardal playing the
[2:16:37] instrument up there. You know how he
[2:16:38] come?
[2:16:40] You don't know. He was the organist in
[2:16:44] the church across the street. Played
[2:16:46] nice organ.
[2:16:49] My neighbor was the choir leader at his
[2:16:53] church
[2:16:55] and she I think I don't want to say bad
[2:16:58] things but I think she was alcoholic
[2:17:03] pretty well and so she'd come to lead
[2:17:06] the choir
[2:17:08] and he was he was stewed on drugs.
[2:17:18] and the and and it's a church
[2:17:22] and we were a bunch of rag tags across
[2:17:25] the street.
[2:17:27] But he came in one day.
[2:17:32] Came in one day and sat in a chair.
[2:17:35] You know what it was? Atmosphere.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; Presence. atmosphere.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; And we knelt down at the chair.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; This is how real it is. Brother Daniel
[2:17:52] knelt down the chair. These are real
[2:17:54] people. These are people who are here.
[2:18:00] And I I stepped up to him before he
[2:18:02] knelt. I said, "Do you think it's for
[2:18:05] you?"
[2:18:08] I could tell it was tough for him to
[2:18:09] answer. Yeah. I said, "I think so." I
[2:18:12] said, "Why don't we why don't we just
[2:18:14] have prayer?"
[2:18:16] And I he could see I was getting ready
[2:18:18] to kneel there. He says, "You mean right
[2:18:20] here?"
[2:18:22] Cuz they never maybe do that in their
[2:18:23] church. I say, "Yeah, right here." So, I
[2:18:26] knelt and he got a hold of the rungs of
[2:18:29] the chair and his knuckles was turning
[2:18:32] white. And I was looking, I could see
[2:18:34] his knuckles hanging on. And while I was
[2:18:37] praying, I was wondering, God, is there
[2:18:39] any hope? Is there any chance? Are you
[2:18:41] going to do anything?
[2:18:43] He doeth the works.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; And without him, it's nothing. We're
[2:18:49] nothing more than the water in the pool
[2:18:51] of Bethesda. Without the angel of the
[2:18:54] Lord, without the Holy Ghost,
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; we're nothing. And I saw him begin to
[2:18:59] tremble,
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; begin to shake, and he hung on to the
[2:19:02] rails of the of the chair harder and
[2:19:05] harder. But the the hand slipped down
[2:19:10] gradually slipped down. He couldn't hold
[2:19:12] on. There's no human that can resist
[2:19:16] that kind of force until the chest is
[2:19:19] down on the chair and sobbing, sobbing.
[2:19:23] When he got up from there, brother Ken
[2:19:26] Ardal was a transformed person.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Did he know the message? No, he didn't
[2:19:32] know all the message. That's not
[2:19:34] important. You need to meet him.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; And then you come to know the message.
[2:19:39] He is the message. He is the word. He's
[2:19:42] the one that do I say who has done all
[2:19:44] these things. He has done these things.
[2:19:48] And when you hear of brother, brother
[2:19:50] brother Tim going to Ethiopia or brother
[2:19:53] Tom and Michael going to the Congo, it's
[2:19:56] not just a trip, friends. That is not
[2:19:59] it. This is I want you to see that this
[2:20:01] is a continuation
[2:20:03] of him doing the things. We're just the
[2:20:07] people. We're just the substance. Oh
[2:20:10] God, come into this congregation, into
[2:20:13] every single life, and give them a
[2:20:16] revelation that that that that God
[2:20:18] ordained that this substance would come
[2:20:21] together.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; And not only that, but your substance to
[2:20:24] another substance,
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; God has ordained it would come together.
[2:20:28] And you people that have come uh from
[2:20:31] Colorado to be with us, somehow God has
[2:20:35] ordained that you should be here. That's
[2:20:37] already had an effect upon us. The
[2:20:40] people will come 1 1500 miles one way to
[2:20:43] be baptized. Sister Jenny Leer Leonard,
[2:20:46] God brought you here. We hear from your
[2:20:48] grandpa every month. And he said, I just
[2:20:51] got a letter from him. God bless you.
[2:20:53] Pray for my hands. His my hands are not
[2:20:56] too steady, but he sends an offering for
[2:20:58] the mission's work every month. God
[2:21:01] bless our brother Vaden Young. I say God
[2:21:04] bless the people. God bless the effect
[2:21:07] that the camp has been. Brother Derek,
[2:21:09] you're not there just working for a
[2:21:12] Mount Baker Bible Way camp. It's not
[2:21:14] that. And brother Matt Bonus, God
[2:21:18] ordained certain people with certain
[2:21:20] skills and certain willing a
[2:21:23] willingness.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends?
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And because I haven't
[2:21:30] mentioned some, it doesn't mean you're
[2:21:32] unimportant. doesn't mean that
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; our deacons and our trustees but the
[2:21:37] people the people
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; we can never never underestimate the
[2:21:43] people the individual you are as a son
[2:21:47] or daughter of God you children you
[2:21:50] young people I tell you I was just a boy
[2:21:53] when God's hand was placed upon me and I
[2:21:56] I I I would just break down and weep I
[2:21:58] would look at a flower and walk through
[2:22:00] the woods and walk in the wilderness
[2:22:03] God saw I needed to walk in the
[2:22:05] wilderness.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; God saw I needed to be without a mother
[2:22:09] and have a father and a stepmother way
[2:22:11] up someplace up in up in construction
[2:22:13] camps. God knew that
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; because we need to be in a place molded.
[2:22:20] God has molded you.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; God has molded you. Each one of you have
[2:22:25] a individual testimony.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; Individual life.
[2:22:32] You may think it's unique. It's not
[2:22:34] unique. It's part of the part of the uh
[2:22:38] unique part of God.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; I knew that it would be a little
[2:22:45] difficult right here because it's so
[2:22:46] hard for people to acknowledge
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; and see.
[2:22:51] There's one aspect about the bride of
[2:22:54] Jesus Christ. You've got to see yourself
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; as somebody very special.
[2:23:01] Somebody that cost the son of God, the
[2:23:04] blood,
[2:23:07] the new creation,
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; the new creation suffered for you.
[2:23:12] You're that special.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; And there's not enough in words in my
[2:23:16] body to say how special God's people
[2:23:20] are.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; How unique they are.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and the effect that you can
[2:23:29] have. Who knows? One day, I assure you
[2:23:34] on the basis of God's word, I assure you
[2:23:37] that you are one day you're going to
[2:23:40] rejoice.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, you said a certain thing."
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; We were sitting
[2:23:47] in a restaurant
[2:23:51] and Joanne was with her mother and I.
[2:23:57] And I've heard my wife say, but I've
[2:23:59] never heard my daughter say, and so I
[2:24:00] guess I can say it to you.
[2:24:03] I heard my wife say many times
[2:24:06] before we came to the message,
[2:24:11] there was a woman,
[2:24:13] she was Sister Opal McGreff.
[2:24:17] I never ever saw her dress
[2:24:21] in uncchristian way. She wore long
[2:24:24] dresses down to here. Her husband was
[2:24:28] just as bold as could be.
[2:24:32] We stopped for gas one time and Sister
[2:24:35] McGriff got up and walked around. That
[2:24:36] was in the age of the miniskirts.
[2:24:42] You girls listen now cuz I'm going to
[2:24:44] talk about a girl, very young girl, my
[2:24:46] own daughter.
[2:24:50] And she walked by and I guess was guy
[2:24:51] was putting in gas. He looked at at
[2:24:54] Sister McGriffin, that kind of mid
[2:24:56] midlength skirt,
[2:24:59] watched her. He says to Brother Mc, he
[2:25:01] said, "Is that the style now?" Chad
[2:25:04] says, "That's always been the style."
[2:25:10] We walked into a service station. A guy
[2:25:13] was cussing and damning and all kinds of
[2:25:15] vulgarity coming out of his mouth.
[2:25:18] Brother McGriff looked at me. He said,
[2:25:20] "I wouldn't hold in my hands what this
[2:25:22] man's got in his mouth."
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, he got the message
[2:25:26] across real quick.
[2:25:31] sitting at the table just the other day,
[2:25:34] two, three days ago,
[2:25:37] I said, "You know, my wife has always
[2:25:39] said, the woman who never preached,
[2:25:43] never tried to convince me about
[2:25:46] anything, just lived the life
[2:25:50] in front of me."
[2:25:53] said, "I I was so affected all through
[2:25:56] my girlhood
[2:25:58] of Sister Opal Mcrist's life."
[2:26:02] And
[2:26:04] Joanne spoke up and she said, "Well, I
[2:26:06] was a very small girl
[2:26:11] and the same life affected me.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; I was a very small girl."
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; Think of it, Tom. You're married to this
[2:26:22] girl now. I was a very small girl. And
[2:26:24] she said, "I noticed that after every
[2:26:28] service when the preacher was when
[2:26:30] brother McGriff or whoever was preaching
[2:26:32] was done preaching, she would get right
[2:26:34] up from where she was sitting, go right
[2:26:36] to the piano and start to play
[2:26:40] for the after service and would stay
[2:26:43] there as long as there was people there.
[2:26:47] She was always she would never answer
[2:26:49] her husband."
[2:26:51] sisters, I don't want you to get
[2:26:52] condemned. She would never answer her
[2:26:55] husband. We lived in their own house.
[2:26:58] We lived in their house. I spent two two
[2:27:00] winters in Portland, pastored a church
[2:27:02] in Hillsboro
[2:27:06] towards Beaverton.
[2:27:08] You think I don't know the area? I know
[2:27:10] it very well. And the woman who owned
[2:27:12] the church wanted me to pastor it
[2:27:14] permanently.
[2:27:16] We couldn't do it because we were having
[2:27:18] meetings in Oregon.
[2:27:20] Washington,
[2:27:22] Idaho,
[2:27:24] and Northern California and traveled
[2:27:27] there. And my wife was carrying a child,
[2:27:31] Linda, Linda.
[2:27:35] And that Sister McGriffin never said a
[2:27:38] word, never gave any special instruction
[2:27:42] or never corrected her or never did
[2:27:46] anything. Just let what am I saying?
[2:27:48] Well, you say I intended to say some of
[2:27:50] this but not all of it. What am I saying
[2:27:53] it for?
[2:27:55] Now you have a sisters sitting amongst
[2:27:57] you today and others which I've talked
[2:28:00] about sitting here today.
[2:28:03] Why are they what they are? I say this
[2:28:06] and excuse my raised voice. God doeth
[2:28:10] the work.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; It's God and a woman. Some never even
[2:28:15] saw the message because the message
[2:28:17] hadn't even come.
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; God did the work.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; God caused them. Why do they live a
[2:28:22] certain way? Why do they remain silent?
[2:28:25] God caused them to be that. That's what
[2:28:27] it took for God to form another person
[2:28:30] the way they wanted them. And you might
[2:28:33] be a certain way or someone else is a
[2:28:35] certain way. Just let leave it in God's
[2:28:37] hands. Say, "Well, people left me or my
[2:28:40] friends left me." Leave it in God's
[2:28:42] hands for once and for all. Leave it in
[2:28:45] God's hands. I've tried to raise you up
[2:28:48] high enough so you can see over above
[2:28:50] all of these things. God's in control.
[2:28:53] Every servant rises or falls before his
[2:28:55] own master. People have asked me, "What
[2:28:57] do you think about this person? What do
[2:28:59] you think?" I don't think about it at
[2:29:00] all. I let God think about it.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; Let God think about it.
[2:29:10] Amen.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen?
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; The substance
[2:29:20] and the evidence. We'll have the
[2:29:22] musicians please come.
[2:29:32] Just while they're coming, will let's
[2:29:34] just bow our hearts.
[2:29:37] Father,
[2:29:42] I've had a special
[2:29:45] just a special relationship with you
[2:29:48] over the last weeks and months.
[2:29:52] It's been very very wonderful.
[2:29:55] I pray Lord that I've been able somehow
[2:29:58] by your grace to pass off to the people
[2:30:02] that we so love.
[2:30:04] some that were mentioned, many that were
[2:30:07] not mentioned,
[2:30:08] not because we have not held them in our
[2:30:11] hearts and in our thoughts and in our
[2:30:14] appreciation.
[2:30:16] And oh God, even for some that may
[2:30:20] wonder if it was a misunderstanding. No,
[2:30:23] not at all. We just leave everything in
[2:30:26] your hands. You're doing everything.
[2:30:30] You're the one, oh God, that's designing
[2:30:32] and you've designed
[2:30:34] this work, whatever it is that we are to
[2:30:37] fulfill. Thus shall it be.
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; I say it in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:30:43] Christ. Thus shall it be. And to think
[2:30:46] up in a little studio, oh God, we have a
[2:30:49] man by the name of brother Murphy Wong
[2:30:51] and he's translating this into Chinese.
[2:30:54] Oh God, and to think that your prophet
[2:30:57] would speak his word. And now this man
[2:31:00] would become so gripped and so caught
[2:31:04] and so hooked upon this word that his
[2:31:07] voice becomes the voice of your
[2:31:09] messenger oh over the hundreds of
[2:31:12] millions of people. How does this happen
[2:31:14] from a place of Cloverdale? God doeth
[2:31:17] it. My father doeth the works. Father,
[2:31:20] Father, you have done the work and we
[2:31:23] give you praise and glory and honor and
[2:31:25] Lord we will not back away from it. We
[2:31:28] will not apologize for it. You have done
[2:31:30] the work and we say glorify yourself, oh
[2:31:34] God. We live our lives that you might be
[2:31:37] glorified that the kingdom of God might
[2:31:39] be lifted up
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. We ask for these
[2:31:44] blessings upon the people now.
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; I'm going to have you stand. Will I'd
[2:31:51] like to sing Brother Ryan
[2:31:54] um
[2:31:56] 7:43 Once I Was Stray.
[2:32:02] Wonder if we can have someone here with
[2:32:03] a voice.
[2:32:06] Okay.
[2:32:07] [Music]
[2:32:22] Once I was straight
[2:32:27] in dark valley,
[2:32:31] no hope within
[2:32:36] I see.
[2:32:40] He searched to heaven
[2:32:45] and found a savior
[2:32:49] to save a world of soul like me.
[2:32:58] Oh, what a savior.
[2:33:03] Hallelu.
[2:33:07] His heart was broken
[2:33:12] on Calary.
[2:33:16] His hands were
[2:33:20] his.
[2:33:23] [Music]
[2:33:25] He gave his life
[2:33:29] for me.
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; Just before we sing the next verse, I'd
[2:33:34] like to say this to you and it might
[2:33:35] change it for you.
[2:33:38] If you listen to the series,
[2:33:41] Port El Bernie,
[2:33:44] I don't know if you have the correct
[2:33:46] tape. I think they may have cut it off
[2:33:47] of one. I feel badly. I hope your song
[2:33:51] has it. a man,
[2:33:55] one of the
[2:33:57] uh
[2:34:00] Charles brothers. Thank you, one of the
[2:34:02] Charles brothers, the eldest who did not
[2:34:05] sing in the trail. They live in uh La
[2:34:09] Push, Washington.
[2:34:12] And I had never heard him sing. He got
[2:34:14] got up there with a bomber jacket and
[2:34:16] real humble missing some major teeth in
[2:34:20] front
[2:34:23] and he says I'm a little stage fright
[2:34:26] little mic fright
[2:34:30] but he said he'd like to sing. Oh what a
[2:34:32] savior.
[2:34:35] All I can tell you is when brother
[2:34:37] Brandham came out the door,
[2:34:39] right after he finished singing,
[2:34:42] he said any preacher that couldn't
[2:34:44] preach after that wouldn't wouldn't be
[2:34:46] much of a preacher.
[2:34:48] So you can imagine how it was. I was
[2:34:51] sitting right behind him and it was so
[2:34:54] divine and so heavenly. It was like
[2:34:57] angels were singing. And I think friends
[2:35:01] how I feel. I feel very privileged to be
[2:35:06] able to give voice.
[2:35:08] Oh, what a savior.
[2:35:12] Oh, what a savior.
[2:35:15] Oh, what a program.
[2:35:17] This is not just another church. You
[2:35:19] understand that? The people of this
[2:35:22] congregation, the people of the bride of
[2:35:25] Jesus Christ have been God has designed
[2:35:28] them and ordained them, put every little
[2:35:31] facet of their life together. And you
[2:35:34] have to recognize, I just want you to
[2:35:36] say, "Praise God. I believe that,
[2:35:38] brother Bisl. I believe that with all my
[2:35:41] heart, we're not merely a special people
[2:35:43] down here in this earth." That's not it.
[2:35:45] We're a heavenly people with a heavenly
[2:35:48] calling ordained and paid for by the
[2:35:51] blood of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[2:35:55] Hallelujah. Don't ask me to be silent
[2:35:57] because I cannot be silent. Oh, what a
[2:36:00] savior.
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; All right, let's sing the verse.
[2:36:12] He left his father
[2:36:16] with all his graes
[2:36:21] with all his Heat.
[2:36:25] Heat.
[2:36:28] [Music]
[2:36:35] Heat. Heat.
[2:36:38] [Music]
[2:36:45] Heat.

[2:36:59] [Music]
[2:37:08] his son
[2:37:12] [Music]
[2:37:17] for even
[2:37:21] death
[2:37:23] water
[2:37:26] I should be crossing
[2:37:30] his hand will lead me
[2:37:36] [Music]
[2:37:39] Come for your glory
[2:37:43] in every sing
[2:37:47] and sing Heat. Heat.
[2:37:50] [Music]
[2:37:59] Oh
[2:38:00] hallelu
[2:38:02] [Music]
[2:38:08] on calary
[2:38:16] [Music]
[2:38:26] for
[2:38:27] [Music]
[2:38:33] Now I have a closing phrase
[2:38:36] [Music]
[2:38:38] out of you young people, young men. I
[2:38:41] know we've spoken about this, Brother
[2:38:42] Kim, Brother John.
[2:38:45] We've spoken to the individuals
[2:38:49] out of this group
[2:38:51] will rise if time shall go on. Don't
[2:38:54] want you to ever forget it. shall rise.
[2:38:57] Maybe the most unsuspecting person will
[2:39:00] rise and God will put his word in your
[2:39:03] mouth
[2:39:05] and you shall live. There'll be young
[2:39:08] ladies that will rise up and be such as
[2:39:11] Sister Tracy and some of you other
[2:39:14] sisters who have given their lives and
[2:39:17] given their homes. And I say there will
[2:39:20] be families that will open their homes.
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; There will be widows that will open
[2:39:24] their homes. Amen.
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; Whatever. Whatever it is, just do
[2:39:28] whatever God allows you to do.
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; Just say, "Here I am. I'm available."
[2:39:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:38] &gt;&gt; Do I have your attention?
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; I believe I do. I felt that while I was
[2:39:44] while I was studying. Listen, church,
[2:39:46] we're not here to build another church.
[2:39:49] We're here, oh God, to to blaze a a a a
[2:39:53] trail straight through.
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; We want to keep the fires burning.
[2:39:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:00] &gt;&gt; And so shall it be.
[2:40:02] &gt;&gt; There'll be young men, I don't know,
[2:40:04] Josh, maybe you'll take the gospel to
[2:40:06] China. I don't know. But when a man is a
[2:40:09] full of the Holy Ghost, young women full
[2:40:11] of the Holy Ghost.
[2:40:14] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'm preaching at you.
[2:40:17] Amen.
[2:40:18] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching at you because this is
[2:40:20] what has to happen.
[2:40:21] &gt;&gt; People like Brother Mil, we're fading
[2:40:23] off the off the scene. People like
[2:40:25] myself, we're fading off the scene.
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; People like Tom and people like Brother
[2:40:30] Tim, John's got a few years to go. What
[2:40:33] are we talking I'm talking about the
[2:40:34] real thing. Hallelujah. We start we
[2:40:38] start fading off the scene because of
[2:40:40] our our lack of energy. Listen friends,
[2:40:43] I'll tell you if I gave to you
[2:40:47] our traveling just the travel flights,
[2:40:51] it's exhausting when I read it. It's
[2:40:53] absolutely exhausting is going to Norway
[2:40:56] and going down to Poland and going to
[2:40:58] India and going this place. Why were we
[2:41:01] going? We weren't joy tripping.
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; We weren't joy tripping.
[2:41:07] [Music]
[2:41:13] I've been to Africa,
[2:41:15] Johannesburg. I'd been there five times,
[2:41:18] five years because we had radio
[2:41:20] broadcast. Did we know? Did we know to
[2:41:23] go places? Yeah. We would go to a whole
[2:41:25] area that was all just uh African
[2:41:28] people.
[2:41:30] And standing there, I thought this is so
[2:41:32] remarkable. And I was standing there in
[2:41:34] the dark at night. We had a radio
[2:41:38] broadcast. It was on Swazi Music Radio,
[2:41:40] 100,000 watt covering 87 million people.
[2:41:45] And I was just standing there amongst a
[2:41:47] whole crowd of maybe 200 250 African
[2:41:50] people standing there and listening to
[2:41:53] the broadcast. I thought, isn't this
[2:41:55] incredible? Here I am probably 10,
[2:41:57] 15,000 miles from home. I'm listening to
[2:42:01] the Bible believers broadcast. Sometimes
[2:42:04] it was the prophet of God speaking.
[2:42:06] Sometimes it was myself speaking or
[2:42:09] sometimes brother Lonnie Lonnie and I
[2:42:12] speaking.
[2:42:14] I was sitting there. I asked somebody
[2:42:16] said, "Do you have tapes of do you have
[2:42:19] the prophets tapes? Do you have brother
[2:42:21] Brandham's tapes?" "Yeah." He said, "I
[2:42:23] get them from I get them from Bible
[2:42:26] believers in Washington." I said, "Good
[2:42:28] outfit.
[2:42:34] Didn't matter that he didn't know me.
[2:42:36] That didn't matter a bit.
[2:42:39] One driving force. And you folks might
[2:42:41] as well get used to it. I've won driving
[2:42:44] force and it's been in with me ever
[2:42:45] since I was just a young man. One
[2:42:48] driving force. Get this word.
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; I don't care how. I don't care where. I
[2:42:55] didn't care. I was a minister. that that
[2:42:57] make no difference at all. Get this
[2:43:00] message. Get a tape recorder. Get
[2:43:02] something and get it out. Get it get it
[2:43:06] translated. Help somebody. That's the
[2:43:08] first thing I want to know.
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Heavenly Father, bless
[2:43:15] this congregation. I pray you will bless
[2:43:18] them with a flame of fire. The Holy
[2:43:21] Spirit has been called the fire, a
[2:43:24] baptism of fire of the Holy Ghost. And
[2:43:27] Lord, I pray that you'll give this
[2:43:29] congregation, a renewed baptism. Give
[2:43:32] them a renewed vision. I pray, Father,
[2:43:34] that there will be a dedication. Even as
[2:43:37] I'm praying now, I pray for a prayer of
[2:43:39] dedication. We dedicate ourselves to
[2:43:42] you. We give ourselves to you. whatever
[2:43:45] is in the program. Lord, we do not know
[2:43:48] the future, but we give ourselves to you
[2:43:50] and all that you would do. Bless, oh
[2:43:53] God, us this afternoon and as we come
[2:43:56] back this evening, we will be here to
[2:43:59] testify and to witness and see our
[2:44:01] precious friends from Colorado baptized.
[2:44:05] Pray that you'll bless this family in
[2:44:07] the name of Jesus Christ. May we have a
[2:44:10] blessed afternoon. We dismiss now with
[2:44:13] your grace in Jesus name. Amen. Would
[2:44:17] you please shake hands with someone
[2:44:18] right next to you? Say, "God bless you."
[2:44:21] And mean it. A smile on your face. God
[2:44:25] bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus
[2:44:27] name.
[2:44:29] God bless you.
