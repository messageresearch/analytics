[4:24] &gt;&gt; number 109 1027 on the screen. It's good
[4:28] to be in the house of the Lord this
[4:29] evening.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. It truly is. We have a
[4:33] neverchanging God.
[4:36] Who acts in his own time and his own
[4:38] season is wonders to perform. We're
[4:41] living witnesses that he's still moving,
[4:43] still dealing with hearts. even in the
[4:45] hospital just a couple of days ago. We
[4:48] met a young man that we'll pray for this
[4:49] evening. His baby had just been flown
[4:52] there, just born a few hours before. And
[4:55] the whole hospital is filled with case
[4:57] after case after case. But one tender
[5:00] man approached me and said, "Would you
[5:02] pray for my little girl?" He could have
[5:05] walked up to anybody and said that, I
[5:07] suppose, but just coming out of the
[5:09] chapel there at the the little hospital.
[5:12] So, we don't know what the Lord is
[5:13] doing. We just say, "Use me, Lord. Lead
[5:17] me, Lord, and I'll follow. Whatever you
[5:19] desire, we'll do. You're all I want."
[5:22] Let's sing it together.
[5:24] You're all I want.
[5:30] You're all that I need.
[5:34] [Music]

[5:41] in the beauty of holiness

[12:24] [Music]
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Father, we just offer you
[12:27] this service this evening.
[12:30] All we want is you, Lord. We desire,
[12:33] Father, that you would come. You said
[12:36] whenever you are invited, Lord, that you
[12:38] are near, Lord. We know your presence
[12:41] has drawn near unto us, Lord. Lord, we
[12:44] desire that you would make yourself
[12:46] known this evening,
[12:48] Lord, not just to be around, Father, but
[12:51] to dwell in us, to live through us, to
[12:54] be your life expressed.
[12:55] [Music]
[12:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[13:01] Glory to your name.
[13:04] Hallelujah.
[13:06] Hallelujah.
[13:08] 10:15 on the screen if you would.
[13:16] Just some songs that I thought were
[13:18] pertinent tonight. They don't
[13:19] necessarily flow key to key. And I know
[13:21] sometimes that's really nice to be able
[13:23] to do, but we want the word to be able
[13:26] to just minister to our hearts tonight.
[13:28] Amen.
[13:30] Lead me Lord.
[13:34] I will follow
[13:40] me.
[13:43] I
[13:44] [Music]

[14:47] will
[14:49] [Music]
[14:51] be
[14:54] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[15:02] [Music]
[15:04] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[15:06] [Music]
[15:14] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[15:21] [Music]

[16:44] You have called me.
[16:48] I will answer.
[16:52] Lead me Lord.
[16:56] I will go. Oh, leave me alone. Lead me
[17:02] Lord. Do you love me?
[17:06] Will you follow me? Let me back you.
[17:09] Will you follow tonight?
[17:18] [Applause]
[17:23] [Music]
[17:23] [Applause]
[17:24] [Music]
[17:29] I will.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; We're stirred tonight, Father, at the
[17:44] anticipation of your word.
[17:47] at the anticipation of what you will
[17:49] speak this evening.
[17:54] Lord, you spoke in the scriptures to
[17:57] Peter and said, "Follow me."
[18:01] Lord, he didn't know what that really
[18:02] meant,
[18:04] but one day he caught the revelation
[18:07] of what follow me really was about.
[18:10] Grant it to us tonight, Lord. Open your
[18:13] word to us, Father. May we be revelated,
[18:17] Lord. We don't want just knowledge. We
[18:19] don't just want to learn quotes or
[18:21] memorize scripture, but we want a living
[18:24] reality today. Take the man of God that
[18:27] will stand behind the sacred desk. Lord,
[18:30] move the man part aside.
[18:32] May the Holy Spirit minister life.
[18:36] May you speak the word that delivers the
[18:39] bond tonight. Lord,
[18:41] that heals the sick.
[18:44] May the lame walk and the blind see. Not
[18:47] just naturally, Lord, but spiritually.
[18:51] &gt;&gt; This world is groping in darkness,
[18:53] Father. But you said there would be a
[18:56] light in the evening time. And so we
[18:58] have gathered, Lord. At the evening
[19:01] time.
[19:04] Hallelujah.
[19:06] Hallelujah.
[19:09] Hallelujah.
[19:12] Just want to read a couple of prayer
[19:13] requests.
[19:16] Brother Alex desires that we remember
[19:18] his mother in Spain who will be going
[19:19] into surgery tomorrow for a hip
[19:22] replacement.
[19:24] [Music]
[19:26] Remember to pray for Sister Audrey Bates
[19:28] from Idaho. She is suffering and in a
[19:30] tremendous amount of pain due to lung
[19:32] cancer. She is praying and desiring a
[19:34] full healing
[19:39] from the the Dods. Brother Ed Dods wrote
[19:42] in that he spoke with a Christian
[19:45] grandmother who asked for prayer for her
[19:46] granddaughter Aaron Smith. Apparently,
[19:49] the baby suffers from broken broken
[19:51] bones, but it never bruises and the
[19:53] parents are blamed for child abuse. It's
[19:55] a tragic situation, but now the mother
[19:58] has been diagnosed with uh severe bone.
[20:02] I don't know how to pronounce that word,
[20:03] but a condition with the bones where
[20:05] they break without really any trauma
[20:07] coming to them. So, they're desiring
[20:09] that the Lord would move on their
[20:11] behalf, grant a healing to both mother
[20:14] and child.
[20:17] Our Lord is more than able. We also want
[20:18] to remember uh it's a an announcement
[20:22] and a uh and a bit of a request. Brother
[20:25] Ken and Sister Helen Buckles are proud
[20:26] grandparents of a baby boy, Luke William
[20:29] Buckles, born this afternoon, March
[20:31] 26th, and uh in Louisville, Kentucky.
[20:34] But they'd ask that we remember the baby
[20:36] in prayer as it uh when it was born. It
[20:39] was amazing that it was alive, the
[20:41] nurses said because the the umbilical
[20:43] cord was in a knot. And uh so they just
[20:46] want to watch it for 48 hours and make
[20:48] sure that the baby's going to be fine.
[20:50] We do want to remember uh my son little
[20:53] David 3 months old. The doctors have
[20:55] diagnosed him with a condition called um
[20:59] hypo hypoglycemia which is a an extreme
[21:02] amount of uh the pancreas is
[21:05] overproducing insulin and it breaks down
[21:07] the sugar too quickly before the body
[21:09] can consume it. But we have a prayer
[21:11] answering God.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; You've been praying. Weii applied the
[21:14] prayer cloth to him. We believe Abraham,
[21:18] it took 25 years and by the time it came
[21:20] over to this side of Calvary, the
[21:21] scripture said he staggered not.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; In our daily walk, sometimes we feel
[21:27] like where where are things? Where are
[21:29] we? But the scripture says we stagger
[21:32] not.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; And that's what the promise says. So we
[21:34] stagger not at the promise of God. I'll
[21:36] ask brother DDA. Brother DDA, if you'd
[21:38] come and just open the service in a word
[21:40] of prayer.
[21:42] Amen. And if you have a need upon your
[21:43] heart, whatever it may be, great or
[21:45] small, our God is more than able to
[21:48] answer our needs.
[21:50] [Music]
[21:56] Father, we are
[21:59] overwhelmed at your presence. Lord,
[22:03] are you come in thine own gentle way?
[22:08] Are you move upon our hearts, oh God?
[22:12] You have such a desire towards your
[22:14] people. Dear Father, we are amazed
[22:18] tonight at your love, at your care, at
[22:21] your grace, at your mercy. Father, at
[22:23] your consideration for us
[22:26] as nothing and nobody is of this world,
[22:29] but how you have redeemed us with your
[22:31] very own blood. I you send this great
[22:34] message of deliverance and truth to
[22:37] cross our paths. That we could be
[22:39] standing here tonight in a world that is
[22:42] dying and corrupting in a world that is
[22:45] falling apart but yet we can stand in
[22:47] the presence of the creator. Knowing
[22:49] that you have given us an audience we
[22:51] can come and make our petition known and
[22:54] you more willing to answer them than we
[22:56] are even to pronounce them tonight.
[22:58] Lord, what confidence we have tonight
[23:01] before the living God, to know that you
[23:04] have something good in store for us,
[23:06] Father. We have not just gathered out of
[23:08] our own desire, oh God. We have gathered
[23:11] according to your word. For you say
[23:13] where two or three are gathered in your
[23:16] name, there you are. So in your divine
[23:18] presence tonight we come with
[23:20] expectation Lord with confidence and
[23:23] with faith that every needs can be met
[23:26] tonight that every heart can be
[23:28] satisfied but only you Jesus. Oh father
[23:33] even as the song was sang tonight. Oh
[23:36] take the world but give me Jesus. You're
[23:39] the one who can meet every need. You're
[23:42] the one who can meet every longing.
[23:44] You're the one who can satisfy every
[23:47] desire tonight. In you are found all the
[23:50] blessings that we have need of. So we
[23:52] come, Father, our hearts are open
[23:54] tonight. We say come and fill us, oh
[23:57] God, with more of yourself, with more of
[24:00] your divine love. Oh God, with more of
[24:03] your presence, Father, just overtake our
[24:06] being once again. Fill us, oh God, until
[24:09] we can take no more tonight. Let it not
[24:12] just be a church gathering, but it'll
[24:14] be, oh father, a meeting with the living
[24:16] God. Touch every soul tonight. Let your
[24:20] word be a revelation to every hearts.
[24:22] Give your servant liberty, oh God, when
[24:25] he open his mouth, that our words of
[24:27] life can flow that he may minister,
[24:30] father, to the inner man. That at the
[24:32] end of the service, we all be
[24:34] strengthened, Father. We'll be more
[24:36] equipped to face this hour and that
[24:38] you're preparing us for a body change.
[24:40] We want to make much of your presence
[24:42] that is here. Not just let this be, oh
[24:45] God, a passing moment, but let it be, oh
[24:48] God, a time that will be long
[24:50] remembered. We know it's a Wednesday
[24:52] evening, Father, but you're here among
[24:54] us, Lord, and in the presence of the
[24:56] living God. Nothing is impossible. Every
[25:00] need can be met, Father. Every burden
[25:03] can be lifted up. Every prayer can be
[25:05] answered if we can but believe tonight.
[25:08] You told us to only believe for all
[25:11] things are possible. Father, we confess
[25:14] that you're more than able to minister
[25:17] to us. Oh God, we believe. Will not go
[25:20] out empty. We came believing and asking.
[25:23] We can go rejoicing. Father, for you are
[25:26] more abundantly supply to us tonight. So
[25:29] touch every life, Lord. The needs that
[25:32] have been mentioned tonight. Some are
[25:34] suffering this day with cancer. Oh God,
[25:37] even with with other kind of condition,
[25:39] Father, that medical sciencers baffle
[25:42] their own, but we believe you're the
[25:44] great physician. We believe you can move
[25:47] on behalf of those that have written
[25:49] down their prayer requests tonight in
[25:52] faith and in confidence that when we
[25:54] gather and unite our hearts as one, our
[25:57] God will answer our petition. So touch
[25:59] them each one I pray and let all the
[26:02] glory be given back to you for you're
[26:05] the great one among us tonight and we
[26:07] recognize you as that father we just
[26:10] want to take the time to tell you that
[26:12] we love you and we appreciate you oh God
[26:15] we delight in you father we just long
[26:18] for more of you tonight we want this
[26:20] meeting to be a special time where you
[26:23] can speak to our hearts where you can
[26:25] move us into a higher plane father where
[26:28] our faith can be increased to believe
[26:30] every promise tonight. Bless your
[26:32] children, oh God, and bless your servant
[26:35] as it come tonight. Would you just have
[26:37] the preeminence, take full control of
[26:40] this gathering and bless every soul and
[26:43] bring glory to your great name as we
[26:45] commit the meeting to you. And we thank
[26:48] you for the privilege of coming in your
[26:50] presence. Father, touch every life. I
[26:53] pray forgive us our shortcoming tonight.
[26:56] Just have your preeminence. We commit
[26:58] ourselves to you, Father, and we thank
[27:01] you in Jesus name. Amen.
[27:06] [Music]
[27:07] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. You may have your
[27:09] seats.
[27:10] As we get ready to turn to the word,
[27:12] we'll just sing. He is here. Hallelujah.
[27:15] He is here. I did mention that young man
[27:18] that I met in the hospital just a few
[27:20] short days ago. this baby had been flown
[27:22] in uh had a has a heart valve I believe
[27:27] that's not opening properly and they've
[27:29] scheduled the little girl for surgery
[27:31] just tomorrow morning. So if you'll
[27:32] remember her in your prayers, we've
[27:35] prayed for her on Sunday night. We went
[27:37] up to their their room where they keep
[27:39] the the little infants in play prayed
[27:41] for and um I believe my wife is going to
[27:44] be with them first thing in the morning
[27:45] about 6:00 again. So just hold them up
[27:48] in your prayers as well.
[27:50] very very nice young man. I'm very
[27:53] actually very moved by having met him.
[27:56] You meet so many people in the world and
[27:57] they feel like the world. But there's
[27:59] something you Brother Brandham used to
[28:01] say when a person would come up and he'd
[28:03] say, "You have a very welcoming spirit."
[28:05] And I would say that about this young
[28:06] man. So just remember him in your your
[28:09] prayer time. Amen. We'll just sing this
[28:11] together as we invite our pastor to
[28:14] come.
[28:16] He is here.
[28:20] Hallelujah.
[28:26] He is here.
[28:29] [Applause]
[28:30] Amen.
[28:33] He is here.
[28:37] Holy,
[28:39] holy.
[28:42] I will bless
[28:44] his holy
[28:47] name.

[28:58] in
[29:00] [Music]
[29:02] your hand.
[29:05] He is here.
[29:08] You can touch him.
[29:13] You will never
[29:16] be
[29:17] the same for me.
[29:25] [Music]
[29:27] [Applause]
[29:27] [Music]
[29:33] Amen.
[29:35] He is
[29:37] [Music]
[29:40] holy.
[29:43] I will bless his
[29:47] name.
[29:52] [Music]
[29:59] Oh
[30:00] [Applause]
[30:02] your
[30:04] [Music]
[30:10] touch.
[30:13] You will never
[30:15] be. Can we stand together as we sing it
[30:18] again? My brother is to come.
[30:22] He is here.
[30:25] Yeah.
[30:27] Heat.
[30:29] [Music]
[30:37] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[30:41] [Music]
[30:48] Yeah. Heat.
[30:56] [Music]
[30:59] Heat. Heat.
[31:05] [Music]
[31:11] You will never
[31:14] be
[31:16] the same.
[31:18] Just before we turn to the word, I'd
[31:20] like to have you sing. We are standing
[31:21] on holy ground. You know, we're
[31:23] privileged people to have heard the
[31:26] things that we've heard, to hear the
[31:28] things we'll hear tonight, to have the
[31:30] message that we have. We're privileged
[31:32] people. Just before coming to church
[31:34] just a short time ago, I received a call
[31:37] also from uh a former resident right of
[31:41] our area. And I don't know whether it
[31:43] was the uh result of the media or what
[31:45] it was, but he looked me up and and uh
[31:48] called and we we just we have never
[31:51] gotten on uh you know on personal things
[31:54] and my heart just became touched and
[31:56] heavy as well uh before the service. He
[32:00] has a 17-year-old son with muscular
[32:03] distrophe and uh no hope, no chance of
[32:07] any recovery, no chance of any outside
[32:11] of God, there'd just be no chance for
[32:14] the young man 17 years old. And I
[32:17] thought of our our young men that are
[32:19] here uh and no future. And he said he's
[32:23] got we've got a window of 5 years if
[32:26] they would discover something in the
[32:28] next 5 years. after 5 years which would
[32:31] only be 22
[32:33] uh the the muscles will be beyond
[32:35] recovery and uh you know I I I just said
[32:39] something to him about prayer and uh
[32:42] he's a very very fine man I don't know
[32:44] if God will open a door but I I just got
[32:49] speaking with my wife after the phone
[32:51] call I said you know the world is a very
[32:54] very very
[32:56] burdened and troubled place and We're so
[33:00] grateful we can come into this this
[33:03] place of retreat that we have place
[33:06] where we can let off the pressure in
[33:09] Christ.
[33:10] I tell you what, when the prophet says
[33:12] we have a place to let off the pressure,
[33:15] not everybody has access to that place.
[33:17] He didn't say we wouldn't have pressure.
[33:19] In fact, he said we would, but we've got
[33:21] a place to let it off.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; And in case you're under pressure
[33:25] tonight, friends, you've arrived at the
[33:27] right place.
[33:29] You got a place you can lay it off.
[33:31] Isn't it wonderful?
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:34] I'd like to sing. We're standing on holy
[33:36] ground.
[33:38] We are standing.
[33:41] [Music]
[33:42] Yes, we are on holy
[33:46] ground.
[33:49] [Music]
[33:54] Yeah.
[33:58] Heat.
[34:03] [Music]
[34:06] [Applause]
[34:06] [Music]
[34:10] Jesus.
[34:16] We are standing
[34:19] in his presence on holy
[34:24] ground.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; We've prayed, but I want to just say,
[34:29] Lord Jesus, we are here tonight to give
[34:32] you thanks, to praise your name, and we
[34:35] we and believe completely that the
[34:38] angels of God are here, the Holy Spirit
[34:42] is present, and you are here. As we've
[34:45] already declared in our previous course,
[34:47] he is here, Lord Jesus. You're here now
[34:51] to make your word alive.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; You're here to give utterance by your
[34:55] Holy Spirit. I pray you'll move on me
[34:57] and through me, oh God. Move on the
[35:00] people and through them, I pray. and may
[35:03] we be revelated tonight according to
[35:07] your own will and desire in the name of
[35:09] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[35:14] So nice to see the house of God full.
[35:17] I'll have you turn in your Bibles to uh
[35:20] the Gospel of John, the 6th chapter.
[35:26] We're going to read from verse 26.
[35:34] And this evening as we uh I I I I'm
[35:38] going to try to restrain myself from
[35:40] preaching because I would like to lay a
[35:43] good foundation for Sunday morning
[35:45] service. And but it's it's it's not easy
[35:49] for me. You know, I'm I'm one to
[35:53] you know what it's all about. You just
[35:55] get fired up and then you have a hard
[35:57] time holding holding the rains in. So,
[36:01] uh, you help me out. If you say amen too
[36:04] many times, I'm going to go for it.
[36:10] All right. Verse 26.
[36:13] Jesus answered them and said, "Verily,
[36:15] verily, I say unto you, you seek me, not
[36:19] because you saw the miracles, but
[36:21] because you did eat of the loaves and
[36:24] were filled. Labor not for the meat
[36:27] which perisheth, but for that meat which
[36:30] endureth unto everlasting life, which
[36:32] the Son of Man shall give unto you, for
[36:36] him hath God the Father sealed. Then
[36:40] said they unto him,
[36:42] "What shall we do that we might work the
[36:46] works of God?"
[36:48] Jesus answered and said unto them, "This
[36:51] is the work of God that you believe on
[36:54] him whom he hath sent."
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[37:05] I'll give you the title to the service
[37:07] right away.
[37:09] Uh it is him whom God hath sent.
[37:16] What shall we do? They said,
[37:20] "What shall we do?
[37:23] We want to do something.
[37:25] Is there something? Is there some action
[37:28] that we can take that we might work the
[37:32] works of God?"
[37:34] And then Jesus said, "This is the work
[37:36] of God." It's interesting uh right away
[37:40] that the word that they used
[37:43] uh for work, what can we do or what
[37:47] shall we do that we might work? And that
[37:51] work that they made reference to is what
[37:54] kind of labor can we do?
[37:57] What can we exercise? What labor? What
[37:59] work should we perform?
[38:02] or is there something we can you know be
[38:04] active in and produce so that it would
[38:07] be the works of God? And Jesus used a
[38:12] different word and he said this is the
[38:16] work of God or this is the labor but the
[38:21] word that Jesus used is this is what you
[38:24] should be occupied with.
[38:27] This is what you should seek to
[38:29] accomplish.
[38:31] This is the act or the deed that you
[38:33] should do. You should be occupied with
[38:38] believing on him who he has sent.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; That's what we should be occupied with.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; That's the instruction of Christ that
[38:49] you believe on him whom God hath sent.
[38:54] That that should that that's that's what
[38:56] should actually be occupying our minds.
[39:00] This is the focal point that uh Jesus
[39:03] has said and the works of God. In other
[39:06] words, the works of God is first and
[39:10] foremost
[39:12] to believe. This is the works of God.
[39:15] First and foremost is to believe on him
[39:19] whom he hath sent.
[39:21] Of course, we could say right away,
[39:23] well, we all we already do. And I'm I'm
[39:26] thankful for uh the congregation here
[39:28] and the believers of the message because
[39:31] we believe on him whom God hath sent and
[39:35] we are we are occupied with that. But I
[39:38] I believe that there's uh really
[39:40] something here for us in this uh in in
[39:44] this uh which I wish to carry it in some
[39:46] depth between now and Sunday morning.
[39:50] One of the more difficult things
[39:54] uh for us as humans and I I say us but
[39:57] it's a general public. One of the most
[39:59] difficult things is for people to
[40:02] acknowledge
[40:04] and to accept
[40:06] him who God hath sent. There always
[40:08] seems to be a built-in
[40:11] uh hesitation to believe on him whom God
[40:15] has sent. People are continually wanting
[40:19] to circumvent and we run into it all the
[40:21] time. This isn't necessarily making a
[40:24] personal reference to yourself here this
[40:26] evening, but what you're confronted with
[40:28] on a on a regular basis is that people
[40:32] are constantly
[40:34] wanting to circumvent or go around and
[40:37] say, "Well, we don't need a prophet
[40:40] &gt;&gt; or we don't need a pastor or we don't
[40:43] need uh some office. We don't need it.
[40:46] We, you know, I got a direct line to
[40:48] God. And uh uh they're always wanting
[40:52] and I can show it. We'll show it in the
[40:54] scripture. That's part of the what we
[40:56] want to do this evening is show how they
[40:58] always want to circumvent God's chosen
[41:03] vessel or messenger at at at any
[41:06] specific time. And there's a there's a
[41:08] reason for that is because I can tell
[41:10] you that Satan is very energetic
[41:14] &gt;&gt; about wanting to turn people aside from
[41:18] the the servant that God sends.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; He's very energized about that subject.
[41:24] And I'll tell you why in a few moments.
[41:27] Now,
[41:29] it's also difficult. This is taken from
[41:32] the other side. Now, it's difficult for
[41:35] those that are chosen and have been
[41:37] chosen to declare it. It's always been
[41:41] difficult. And the Bible tells us, I'm
[41:44] going to give a number of scriptures if
[41:45] you want to uh just follow along or just
[41:48] make a note of it.
[41:51] In Matthew 3 and3,
[41:54] uh John the Baptist, he's coming on the
[41:57] scene and he's saying, "For this is he
[42:01] that was spoken of by the prophet
[42:03] Isaiah, saying, the voice of one crying
[42:06] in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of
[42:08] the Lord, and make his paths straight."
[42:11] So now he's identifying himself
[42:15] uh out of the scriptures. This is he
[42:18] that was spoken of by the prophet
[42:20] Isaiah. And therefore uh God always
[42:24] presented his elected always presented
[42:27] his elected or his chosen in a veiled
[42:31] way.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; He always did.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Right. Yes, he did.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Joseph,
[42:38] I'm going to just take a number of of
[42:40] examples. Joseph in the Old Testament
[42:43] chosen of God, but he presents him in a
[42:46] veiled way. He was veiled by dreams.
[42:51] He gave the dreams to his brothers and
[42:55] to his uh to his mother and father. And
[42:59] as a result of those dreams, he was
[43:01] terribly misunderstood. In other words,
[43:05] as a result of his being chosen to
[43:08] fulfill a certain place, he was
[43:11] completely misunderstood. And that
[43:14] happened to be the focal point of not
[43:17] only misunderstanding
[43:19] but of of of I would say a a family
[43:22] trouble within the family and dissension
[43:26] and even hatred between the brothers was
[43:29] was the actual focal point of his being
[43:31] chosen of God.
[43:34] And so God, he didn't just come out and
[43:36] declare I've been chosen of God, you
[43:39] know, to do special things. He didn't
[43:42] make that declaration. It was so God
[43:46] allowed it to be veiled and he had
[43:49] dreams and perhaps didn't under
[43:51] certainly didn't understand the full
[43:52] extent of the dream. But he tells what
[43:54] the dream was and and then they begin to
[43:57] perceive that, you know, that he's he's
[43:59] going to be elevated. He's going to be
[44:02] lifted up somehow and they can't piece
[44:04] it together or how this but it's it's
[44:06] sufficient to irritate them and it
[44:09] becomes an irritation. his his choosing
[44:12] the very fact and God is slowly letting
[44:15] him know uh that you know not the full
[44:19] degree of his being chosen and what he's
[44:22] being chosen for but just allowing him
[44:24] to know that he's in a different
[44:27] category
[44:28] &gt;&gt; than those that are around him and
[44:31] sufficiently enough to irritate it just
[44:33] becomes an irritation
[44:38] &gt;&gt; that's Joseph
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Moses
[44:42] He was veiled
[44:44] in humiliation
[44:46] as a failed leader.
[44:49] After all, he murdered a man, tried to
[44:51] hide him in the sand. This is not a
[44:53] myth. It's not just a story. It is it's
[44:55] an event. That's what happened to him.
[44:58] He actually failed. and he fell from uh
[45:02] the height of leadership and glory and
[45:04] power and a and a man who knew war and
[45:07] was educated in all the ways of Egypt.
[45:10] He was a next pharaoh perhaps and and
[45:13] living in the glory of the of the
[45:15] superpower of that day.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And to go from that to be on the
[45:20] back side of a desert wrapped in
[45:23] shepherd's garments and looking after
[45:26] sheep, it must have gone through his
[45:29] mind quite a few times because he would
[45:32] have just as alert a memory as you do.
[45:35] And if you had gone from that to to
[45:38] being a shepherd, and a shepherd even by
[45:41] the Egyptian standard was something to
[45:43] be disdained.
[45:45] you're a shepherd. And God allowed him
[45:47] to go right down to the bottom as it
[45:50] were. And no doubt in the quietness of
[45:53] the desert, in the quietness of just
[45:56] having the sheep bleeding and feeding
[45:59] and very very little activity with that.
[46:02] That was a long way from the chariots
[46:06] and the armies and the trumpets and the
[46:10] uh marble palaces and the beautiful
[46:12] carpets of the Persian uh of that era
[46:16] and that time. I mean he went a long
[46:19] ways. You can hardly imagine that. And
[46:21] no doubt he thought you know what is
[46:25] happening and yet God was bringing him
[46:29] to a place uh and and and what God was
[46:33] going to use him for. God was actually
[46:36] veiling
[46:38] him in his choosing. He was choosing him
[46:42] to use him in in a way that he couldn't
[46:45] couldn't even imagine.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Right? And so God was also preparing him
[46:50] uh in in this uh in in his uh uh shall I
[46:55] say in in in the life that he was
[46:58] experiencing. He was also naturally
[47:02] speaking
[47:03] he had difficulty and God was veiled in
[47:07] that. God was veiling Moses him also.
[47:11] I'm speaking about Moses being veiled.
[47:13] He was veiled in the fact that he was
[47:15] slow of speech and he was he was not an
[47:19] impressive speaker. And here's a man
[47:21] that God chose to give the law.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; He's going to speak on behalf of God.
[47:28] And God said clearly and Moses had to
[47:31] say it because Moses wrote the first
[47:33] five books. He had to say that he was
[47:37] the meakest man on the earth. had to say
[47:41] that God had to speak on behalf of God
[47:43] that God has spoken to no other man like
[47:45] he spoke to him.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Now it doesn't sound like the meakest
[47:48] man, but he had to be truthful also.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; And so that's but he was so slow and and
[47:55] I don't know what the manner of his
[47:57] speech was. But you know, you that are
[47:59] believers of the message, you can you
[48:01] see the message that we have and the and
[48:03] and the grammar of it and how it's
[48:06] broken down and and how it was delivered
[48:09] to us. It's the the message that you
[48:11] have. Uh there's a lot of similarities.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; It is not the, you know, it is not the
[48:19] flamboyant. It is not the majestic
[48:23] literature. It is to us,
[48:26] &gt;&gt; but it's not to the average person
[48:28] &gt;&gt; because that's all part of God's veil,
[48:32] &gt;&gt; sir.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; And the and this is this is a part of
[48:38] the misunderstanding.
[48:41] Although, and this is difficult for us
[48:43] to perhaps grasp, but although it was
[48:46] abundantly evident that Moses was the
[48:50] chosen and that God was with him because
[48:53] he had already had uh uh the miracles
[48:57] and the plagues that came in Egypt. And
[49:00] then they get out uh out into the
[49:04] wilderness a short distance. And this
[49:07] very fact that he was chosen is is some
[49:11] of his greatest trouble.
[49:14] And the Bible says, "Now Kora,
[49:17] the son of Ishar, and the son of Korath,
[49:20] the son of Levi, and Dayathan and
[49:24] Abraham, the sons of Eliab, and Anne,
[49:28] the son of Pelath, sons of Reuben, took
[49:32] men,
[49:35] and they rose up before Moses with
[49:38] certain of the children of Israel,
[49:41] 250 princes, of the assembly, famous in
[49:46] the congregation,
[49:48] men of renown. I'd like you to notice,
[49:51] you've read it, and these are perhaps
[49:53] very familiar to you, but in the context
[49:56] of what I'm going to be bringing you, I
[49:59] want you to see this now. the very fact
[50:02] that God had chose him and to the degree
[50:06] he was chosen. He wasn't just chosen to
[50:08] come back out of his uh uh shepherd work
[50:13] back to Egypt. He wasn't just chosen to
[50:16] bring the plagues on Egypt. He wasn't
[50:19] just chosen to become a deliverer for
[50:22] Israel. But now he also has trouble
[50:26] within his own delivered people because
[50:30] of the degree of his his choosing
[50:33] &gt;&gt; because when they get out there and
[50:35] realize he's actually the only
[50:37] mouthpiece of God
[50:40] &gt;&gt; that becomes his trouble.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Not not that he was able to deliver
[50:44] them. That wasn't the problem. Not that
[50:46] he had power with God. That wasn't the
[50:49] trouble. But the people around them
[50:51] failed to failed to recognize that God
[50:56] had extended or intensified
[50:59] this choosing to the place where he was
[51:02] the only mouthpiece.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; And that's where the problem started to
[51:06] arise. And so they continued and you
[51:09] could see that they these men they had
[51:12] influence amongst the people of Israel.
[51:15] When you raise up 250
[51:19] men of renown,
[51:21] I mean, these weren't men who were
[51:22] unimpressive in their conversation or
[51:25] their speech like Moses was. These were
[51:28] men who were articulate. These were men
[51:31] who were commanding. These were men of
[51:34] personality. These were men who could
[51:36] rise up and stand up and have the
[51:38] attention of the people and so that the
[51:40] people were swayed by it.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:45] And the Bible says, "And they gathered
[51:47] themselves together against Moses and
[51:49] against Aaron, and said unto them,
[51:53] you take too much upon yourself,
[51:57] seeing that all the congregation is
[52:00] holy." Moses never said they weren't
[52:02] holy.
[52:05] He never said that they weren't holy,
[52:07] but now they're they're pressing a
[52:09] certain point. All of the people are
[52:12] holy
[52:13] and every one of them and the Lord is
[52:17] amongst them. Wherefore then lift ye up
[52:20] yourselves above the congregation of the
[52:22] Lord. They never lifted themselves up
[52:24] but they perceived by the by
[52:28] misinterpreting the choice of God. And
[52:31] so really now when you boil this thing
[52:33] down, what they're really doing is
[52:35] saying, "God, you've made a mistake
[52:39] in this choosing. You've made a
[52:41] mistake." And they want to circumvent
[52:44] the very the very mouthpiece that God
[52:47] has chosen.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; So now they're telling God, "Uh, this is
[52:52] the wrong choice."
[52:55] Uh, and even God's preparation.
[52:59] Oh my, I want I'm just throwing some
[53:01] things out that I'm going to come back
[53:02] to.
[53:04] They're saying to God, "Your preparation
[53:07] of this vessel was somehow faulty.
[53:11] This one isn't really prepared for this
[53:14] position. And there's something that is
[53:18] uh uh that is that it just isn't
[53:21] adequate. It's not sufficient." and they
[53:23] want to go around it. And so they said,
[53:27] "And you've lifted up yourself above the
[53:30] congregation of the Lord." And when
[53:32] Moses heard it, he fell upon his face.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Just imagine the the kind of vessel he
[53:41] was when he heard it. You're not the
[53:45] only holy one. The whole congregation's
[53:47] holy. He could see the direction that
[53:49] they were coming from. He could see what
[53:51] and he knew what the consequence was and
[53:54] he fell on his face.
[53:57] That was Moses. I'm just bringing a
[54:01] number of characters out of the
[54:02] scripture to show that
[54:06] uh their the the focal point is that
[54:09] their choosing them being chosen of God
[54:13] was a problem to them.
[54:16] Lord willing
[54:18] on Sunday, I want to bring it.
[54:23] You also have been chosen. Yes, sir.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Amen.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; That's going to be one of your biggest
[54:29] problems.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; True.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; It's one of your biggest problems.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; If you think that's going to be a what
[54:39] the young people call a cakewalk, it's
[54:41] not.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[54:43] And regardless of where what your status
[54:46] is or where you are,
[54:49] there's two things that happen here. One
[54:51] is that the individual Moses, David,
[54:54] Joseph, all of them going to come to the
[54:56] rest of them, they had to realize that
[55:00] God had singled them out
[55:02] &gt;&gt; for a certain choosing.
[55:05] And then they had to also realize that
[55:09] this and if they didn't realize it, they
[55:11] would soon realize it because that
[55:14] happens to be the whole atmosphere and
[55:17] the environment of the world is in
[55:19] opposition to God's choosing.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; And that starts to be the rubbing spot.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; That's that is the irritant. And you
[55:30] cannot
[55:32] you cannot rid yourself of that
[55:34] irritant.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; As much as you may try or as much as you
[55:38] try to, you know, uh uh pacify it, you
[55:43] just it's impossible to do so. It's just
[55:46] going to be an irritant.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Let me go on.
[55:50] David also uh we could we could uh just
[55:55] make a few references uh to David.
[56:00] The the choosing of God was veiled in
[56:03] him in that not only that he was the
[56:06] youngest but he was just a strippling.
[56:07] The Bible says he was a strippling. He
[56:10] was just a a a little unimpressive
[56:12] fellow. And yet he was the one
[56:16] even Samuel the prophet missed it. said,
[56:20] "Surely this is the one." No, surely
[56:22] this is the one. Surely this is the one.
[56:25] Then if you brought it down into, you
[56:27] know, into our time or into the time
[56:29] when the message was coming forth,
[56:32] you know, uh there was men that had had,
[56:37] I would say, more powerful ministries on
[56:41] the surface,
[56:42] &gt;&gt; right,
[56:43] &gt;&gt; than than than brother Brandham's
[56:45] appeared to be. when I was with him on
[56:48] one occasion, he said he'd just come by
[56:49] come by come through Tulsa on the way up
[56:52] north and he he was uh with brother Oral
[56:55] Roberts and he just said you know
[56:57] brother Oral and he said we he said oh
[57:01] my
[57:02] uh he said the enterprise that he has
[57:06] the work that he has is just you know he
[57:09] said I I wouldn't know what I would do
[57:11] with that he said you know and then I
[57:13] think of my little office and he
[57:14] described the building that he was in
[57:17] and kind of the aluminum ceiling or
[57:19] something and it was so impressive. He
[57:21] was impressed with it and then you know
[57:24] he just re his his little office
[57:27] relative to what he just saw. He said
[57:29] it's just you know it's just nothing. I
[57:31] have a little desk and so on and uh uh
[57:35] there were a lot of ministries. There
[57:37] were men who could speak. I don't know
[57:39] if you've ever heard Erin Baxter who was
[57:40] brother Brandham's manager. I I' I've
[57:43] heard on a tape him speak on faith.
[57:46] powerful. I mean, he was powerful. But
[57:48] the thing was
[57:52] that's choosing of God.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; God's not impressed with how people can
[57:58] put words together.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; God's impressed with humility.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; And God's servants are humble. And
[58:05] brother Brandham said, "God's people are
[58:07] humble." And there are certain things,
[58:10] there are certain qualities that
[58:12] identify God's people.
[58:15] David was uh one of those that
[58:20] I would say the call of God on his life
[58:22] was was veiled. Let me speak of John the
[58:26] Baptist for just a moment.
[58:29] Then said they unto him, speaking to
[58:31] John the Baptist,
[58:34] who are you? Who art thou?
[58:39] That we may give an answer to them who
[58:40] sent. So there was people who were
[58:42] wondering that who sent them said go to
[58:43] this go to this man and ask him who he
[58:46] is
[58:48] and what do you say about yourself.
[58:52] So he said
[58:54] I'm the voice of one crying in the
[58:56] wilderness. Make straight the way of the
[58:59] Lord as said the prophet Isaiah.
[59:02] I'm certain I'm absolutely convinced
[59:05] that they were not satisfied with that
[59:07] answer. Right. Well,
[59:10] &gt;&gt; who are you?
[59:12] We we need to give a a sufficient answer
[59:15] to those who have sent us. What was why
[59:18] were they even asking that question?
[59:21] Because they could see not because they
[59:23] wanted to really know, but they were
[59:26] being it was it was an annoyance to
[59:28] them. It was an irritation to them
[59:31] because there was just certain
[59:33] characteristics about him that was
[59:36] troubling. And so they wanted to find
[59:38] out who you are. And God was veiling in
[59:41] in his very character in the way that he
[59:44] was. He was veiling that the fact that
[59:47] he was chosen of God to to and and I'm
[59:51] sure that John the Baptist did not
[59:53] understand what the extent I'm sure at
[59:55] that moment he could not tell them uh
[59:58] I'm due for a beheading in a short time.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm headed for prison. I'm sure that
[1:00:04] that was not part of what he knew about
[1:00:08] himself. So even his even the degree of
[1:00:11] his choosing was being veiled by God to
[1:00:15] to to John the Baptist himself.
[1:00:18] And then we we can come to Jesus and I
[1:00:22] could spend the whole service on this.
[1:00:25] Then said they unto him, who art thou?
[1:00:29] Same question, same people, same
[1:00:32] problem.
[1:00:34] There's just something in the psyche of
[1:00:38] the unbeliever
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; that can sense you're different.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; You're just different. And that
[1:00:46] difference isn't something that we
[1:00:48] really revel in and love to see, but
[1:00:51] it's something that's troubling to us.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; And haven't got any real substance to
[1:00:56] itemize why they're troubled. You stand
[1:01:00] away and say, "What is it?" Well, uh, is
[1:01:04] he a good man? Oh, yes, absolutely.
[1:01:08] Uh, you know, wonderful man, this young
[1:01:10] prophet. H, what do you have against,
[1:01:13] uh, you know, brother Brandham's
[1:01:16] ministry? Oh, he was a good man and
[1:01:18] wonderful ministry and all of these
[1:01:20] things, but to really identify what is
[1:01:22] the irritation
[1:01:24] and then they invent invent false
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; phrases
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; went off in the end.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; True. I want to announce to this
[1:01:37] congregation that has to be one of the
[1:01:40] most erroneous statements,
[1:01:42] one of the most absurd statements, one
[1:01:45] of the most childish and juvenile
[1:01:47] statements. And people who who
[1:01:50] themselves think themselves to be
[1:01:52] theologically, you know, attuned and
[1:01:56] educated and so on to come up with such
[1:01:58] a statement.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; It went off on the end. Well, please
[1:02:02] tell me about that.
[1:02:04] and they're lost.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; See, totally lost. I'm just throwing
[1:02:09] this in so you kind of see where I'm
[1:02:11] coming from. Then they said to Jesus,
[1:02:14] "Who art thou?" And Jesus said to them,
[1:02:17] "Even the same that I said unto you from
[1:02:19] the beginning." I'm trying to say
[1:02:22] something to you. You know, when when
[1:02:23] even you are asked very specific and
[1:02:27] direct questions, what is it that you
[1:02:29] believe? It's not always good to say so.
[1:02:33] Well, I believe just exactly what you
[1:02:36] have seen in my life. Whatever that is.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; If you like it, great. If you don't, too
[1:02:42] bad.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; I'm living what I believe.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't always answer questions.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; In fact, is when he was asked question,
[1:02:54] a very specific question, you know what
[1:02:56] he did? He said, "I'll ask you a
[1:02:58] question." Yeah.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; And rather than be on the defensive, he
[1:03:04] went on the offensive.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; And that's a very, very good principle.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Very good principle. And it's something
[1:03:11] you should always remember. I use it in
[1:03:13] fact all the time.
[1:03:17] And I'll tell you how I use it in just a
[1:03:19] moment. So Jesus said, "I'll ask you a
[1:03:21] question. John the Baptist, was he of
[1:03:23] God or was he of man?" So they had to
[1:03:26] get into a huddle. And they said, 'Well,
[1:03:29] if we say that he was of man, they're
[1:03:31] going to stone us because they think
[1:03:32] that John was a a prophet. If we say
[1:03:34] he's of God, then he's going to say,
[1:03:36] 'Why didn't you believe him?
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; So they come back and say, "We can't
[1:03:40] say."
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "Neither can I tell you."
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; People come, you know, from Pentecost,
[1:03:49] those that have felt that they had the,
[1:03:51] you know, kind of the ultimate of full
[1:03:54] gospel say, "Well, he went off in the
[1:03:57] end." I said, "Well, just a second." Uh,
[1:03:59] you know, they asked me maybe a question
[1:04:00] or two. Let me ask you a question. Is
[1:04:03] Pentecost today where it was
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; years ago?
[1:04:08] Oh,
[1:04:10] then they almost need to go into a
[1:04:11] huddle.
[1:04:13] So, well, well, no, it's not. Uh, you're
[1:04:15] right. It sure isn't. In fact, is today
[1:04:18] it's a disgrace, isn't it? Are you
[1:04:20] upholding what it are you upholding what
[1:04:22] it is right now? Are you upholding all
[1:04:23] of this Hollywood stuff? Are you
[1:04:25] upholding all of this world? Are you
[1:04:27] upholding all of this nonsense?
[1:04:31] Well, and then they get backpedaling
[1:04:33] right away. Are you upholding all this
[1:04:36] appearance? Are you upholding all this
[1:04:38] Hollywood showmanship? Are you upholding
[1:04:40] all of this rock bands?
[1:04:44] Utter nonsense. Are you upholding that?
[1:04:46] Is that what you're saying? No. No.
[1:04:48] Don't Don't talk to me about what I what
[1:04:50] I believe.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; You don't have any you don't have any
[1:04:53] grounds for that. Amen.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; It's good to ask him some questions.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; And then
[1:05:10] Jesus said,
[1:05:12] "Verily, verily, I say," this is John
[1:05:14] 8:51, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:05:17] if a man keep my saying, he shall never
[1:05:19] see death."
[1:05:20] Then said the Jews unto him, now we know
[1:05:23] thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and
[1:05:27] the prophets, and thou sayest of a man,
[1:05:29] keep my saying, he shall never taste of
[1:05:32] death. Art thou greater than our father
[1:05:34] Abraham, which is dead, and the prophets
[1:05:37] are dead. Whom makest thou thyself?
[1:05:42] See where their trouble was? Because
[1:05:45] they they now had come to a conclusion.
[1:05:48] He had elevated himself to such a place.
[1:05:51] Who do you make yourself?
[1:05:54] You call yourself the bride.
[1:05:57] Who do you make yourself?
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; You call yourself elected or chosen. And
[1:06:03] if you can't, there's a problem.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; It's a bigger problem.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; If you can't
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; now for the people, I want to make this
[1:06:14] as a statement. And I actually wanted it
[1:06:15] on slides tonight, but I didn't have
[1:06:17] sufficient time for the people to
[1:06:20] ignore.
[1:06:22] Listen now, for the people to ignore,
[1:06:26] to resist, or to reject God's prepared
[1:06:30] men of choice
[1:06:34] is to declare by their actions that
[1:06:37] number one, God's choice of a man was
[1:06:40] the wrong choice. Number two, his
[1:06:44] preparation and molding of that man was
[1:06:48] faulty or insufficient.
[1:06:51] And number three, that he God is not
[1:06:55] successful in achieving his objective
[1:06:59] and his spiritual purpose in that in
[1:07:02] that age that he sent that man in. So
[1:07:05] they're they're essentially saying by
[1:07:08] anyone saying or feeling or having the
[1:07:11] sense we don't need this. We don't need
[1:07:14] a prophet. We don't need a messenger is
[1:07:18] to is to find fault directly with God.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Your choosing was wrong.
[1:07:24] in fact is of a person where I'm coming
[1:07:26] down to is for that person or people of
[1:07:32] this age what they're really saying is
[1:07:36] when that prophet was revealing the
[1:07:38] secrets of the heart and people
[1:07:39] trembling in the presence of God and
[1:07:41] saying it is right it is true it is true
[1:07:44] they're saying that was wrong
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; that ministry is wrong
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; and then to say oh no that was all
[1:07:53] right? But then uh the teaching's wrong
[1:07:56] or something else is wrong. Now they've
[1:07:58] set themselves up as a god
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; to make a determination of what is truth
[1:08:04] and what isn't truth. Good.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; See, the reason I'm bringing this is
[1:08:10] that I I I I want that the people have
[1:08:14] uh
[1:08:16] we need to have knowledge about the
[1:08:18] spirit that's in the world and how we
[1:08:21] deal with those things. And I this will
[1:08:24] be really helpful to you. And I'd like
[1:08:27] to make a statement to say that God's
[1:08:29] choice of a man is a wrong choice. Or to
[1:08:32] infer that by saying in action, we don't
[1:08:36] need them. We don't need it. We don't
[1:08:38] need the message. We don't need God's
[1:08:40] choice. Or to say that the preparation
[1:08:43] and the molding was insufficient or
[1:08:46] faulty at some in some way. And that and
[1:08:50] that is to say that God is not
[1:08:52] successful in achieving. In other words,
[1:08:54] he will not achieve his goal.
[1:08:57] Now, I'll just put it to you this way.
[1:09:01] Supposing that God chooses a vessel, a
[1:09:05] messenger, and sends him out and says,
[1:09:07] as brother Brandham said,
[1:09:10] I'm I'm sent to bring a message to
[1:09:13] forrun the second coming. I've been
[1:09:16] sent, Lord, uh, let me get your son a
[1:09:20] bride. If that was his ministry and
[1:09:23] someone's trying to circumvent that, how
[1:09:25] in the world are they going to be in the
[1:09:27] bride that the messenger that they want
[1:09:30] to reject or turn away from the very
[1:09:32] messenger was sent to get it?
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Now, that in my books, and you can write
[1:09:38] this down if you want, that is the
[1:09:40] ultimate insult to the face of God.
[1:09:44] Right.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; The Bible says Hebrews 12:25, "See that
[1:09:51] you refuse not him that speaketh.
[1:09:54] For if they escape not who refuse him
[1:09:57] that spake on earth, much more shall not
[1:10:00] we escape, if we turn away from him that
[1:10:03] speaketh from heaven."
[1:10:12] What was it that the angel said to uh
[1:10:16] the prophet? What was the angel that
[1:10:19] delivered the message said to him? If
[1:10:21] you can get the people to believe you,
[1:10:26] if you can get the people to believe
[1:10:27] you, nothing will stand before your
[1:10:30] prayers, not even cancer.
[1:10:35] This is interesting which I've never
[1:10:37] done before.
[1:10:39] 286 times in the message, Brother
[1:10:43] Brandham used the phrase, "You believe
[1:10:45] me to be God's prophet."
[1:10:49] 286 times.
[1:10:52] 92 times on top of that. Do you believe
[1:10:55] me to be God's prophet? 286 times. Do
[1:10:58] you believe me to be his prophet?
[1:11:02] And that believing
[1:11:05] I mean now what would a what would the
[1:11:08] purpose of him saying that to over 400
[1:11:13] people directly and there are other
[1:11:15] variations of it many many there'd be
[1:11:18] hundreds
[1:11:19] what would be the purpose now I'm
[1:11:23] bringing it really down that would be a
[1:11:26] supreme deception
[1:11:29] if it were not the truth believe it.
[1:11:31] Right?
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; And for people to believe it, they
[1:11:35] received an answer from God.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; No one that I have ever heard on tape
[1:11:40] said, "No, I don't believe that."
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; They all gave an affirmative.
[1:11:48] Believing
[1:11:51] was not to be limited to healing or
[1:11:53] miracles.
[1:11:55] But believing if a person was believing,
[1:11:58] if you actually said, I believe that God
[1:12:02] has sent this messenger, I believe that
[1:12:04] you are a prophet of God.
[1:12:07] Right away, we're faced with a we're
[1:12:10] faced with a another issue, and that is,
[1:12:13] are we believing? And now I could bring
[1:12:16] it right down to us here this evening.
[1:12:19] He also said believing is doing it.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; So that takes us a long ways beyond
[1:12:25] saying oh I go to Bible way. That
[1:12:28] doesn't really mean anything. You know
[1:12:30] that that doesn't mean anything. It says
[1:12:32] what do you do when you hear the
[1:12:33] message? Well that is that you know I'm
[1:12:36] a doer of the word
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; not a hearer only.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; I'm a doer of the word.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Now can you say amen?
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not a hearer only of the word.
[1:12:45] And and that brings it right down
[1:12:48] because in believing in believing
[1:12:52] in the message.
[1:12:54] Oh, I wish I could just tell you what's
[1:12:56] in my heart right now, but I don't want
[1:12:58] to necessarily get out in public, but
[1:13:00] I've had people that have, in fact,
[1:13:03] there some something has just taken
[1:13:05] place in the last about the last week.
[1:13:09] a man that I sat right in this church
[1:13:12] with. And I've just been finding out
[1:13:14] some of these things. I just found out
[1:13:16] today that brother uh brother Dave Chber
[1:13:21] and other brothers in this church have
[1:13:23] had contact with a man that came here to
[1:13:25] correct me on the godhead. And he was a
[1:13:28] a leader amongst Pentecostal people and
[1:13:31] over. And I found out since I just found
[1:13:34] out recently, in fact is some of it
[1:13:36] today. This man ended up with a complete
[1:13:40] nervous breakdown.
[1:13:42] His son is some leader. His son sat
[1:13:46] right in this church a number of times.
[1:13:49] and his son is some leader in some rock
[1:13:51] band,
[1:13:53] Christian rock band
[1:13:56] with with all kinds of, you know, studs
[1:14:00] and tattoos and all of this stuff and
[1:14:03] people and young people out there,
[1:14:07] waving like this,
[1:14:10] and has gone from a place of leadership,
[1:14:14] a place of respect, a place of esteem in
[1:14:17] the Christian community
[1:14:20] to become uh uh out of the ministry
[1:14:24] completely out of it
[1:14:27] driving a truck or driving a bus. I'm
[1:14:31] not saying that in a derogatory way. My
[1:14:34] heart is heavy. I feel so sorry that
[1:14:37] people have been confronted with
[1:14:39] something so beautiful,
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; so clean, so so productive of holiness.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:48] can look right at it, turn, walk right
[1:14:51] away and literally just sink.
[1:14:58] Because you know why?
[1:15:00] In believing is blessing and
[1:15:04] disbelieving is curse.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; That's not me.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; That's God's word.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; If you believe God's word, there's a
[1:15:13] blessing. you reject it and turn from it
[1:15:16] and say nasty things and evil things
[1:15:18] against it, it's a curse.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; And God said through Moses, "Behold, I
[1:15:25] set before you this day a blessing and a
[1:15:28] curse. A blessing if you obey the
[1:15:31] commandments of the Lord your God, which
[1:15:33] I command you this day. A blessing if
[1:15:36] you obey it." The blessing went with
[1:15:40] obeying.
[1:15:42] Now,
[1:15:45] I'm going to take a a few minutes uh
[1:15:48] longer if I can.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; I want to look carefully. I'm going to
[1:15:53] just go to right angles now and look
[1:15:55] carefully at
[1:15:58] um
[1:16:00] I'd like to go back. If you go back to
[1:16:02] the beginning
[1:16:04] uh of something that God does, it will
[1:16:06] reveal his plan, his motive, his
[1:16:10] objective, and the thought behind his
[1:16:12] action.
[1:16:14] So when God made the first man, I'm just
[1:16:17] following my notes very closely because
[1:16:18] I want you to I want to be able to say
[1:16:21] these things in in statements. When God
[1:16:23] made the first man, Adam, we could say
[1:16:26] that God,
[1:16:28] the invisible God, was bringing his
[1:16:32] creative word to a higher level. Think
[1:16:35] about that just for a moment. Now, when
[1:16:38] God made the first man, Adam,
[1:16:42] we can say that the invisible God, which
[1:16:46] brother Brandham says he could not be
[1:16:47] understood, it'd be far too mysterious.
[1:16:51] And so that God of of that fills all
[1:16:55] time and space is now bringing a
[1:16:57] creature by his word. And he had set in
[1:17:00] motion a process in bringing his son
[1:17:04] Adam to become physical
[1:17:08] visible representation
[1:17:10] of himself on the earth. He set the
[1:17:14] process in motion.
[1:17:17] And I I you can write these down if you
[1:17:20] want, but he was bringing his quotation
[1:17:23] creation thoughts or thoughts of
[1:17:27] creation because God had thoughts of
[1:17:29] creation to a higher level
[1:17:33] by his thought expressing words
[1:17:38] because a prophet said that
[1:17:41] he spoke the word and the word was an
[1:17:43] expression of his thoughts. So he
[1:17:45] thought it first. So God thought about
[1:17:47] having a man
[1:17:51] and it was Adam. It could it could be no
[1:17:53] one else cuz it was Adam. That was a
[1:17:56] supreme choice
[1:17:59] in the back of and I you've got to think
[1:18:02] about this to see where I'm going in a
[1:18:04] in a little bit. And I just want to kind
[1:18:06] of point towards Sunday.
[1:18:09] So God
[1:18:11] way back in the eternities
[1:18:16] in his thoughts,
[1:18:18] he's determining what kind of a person,
[1:18:22] what kind of a son he wants to have.
[1:18:29] And the Bible tells us that that he made
[1:18:32] him. And I'm going to dwell on that in a
[1:18:35] few moments. That they made
[1:18:39] Adam. This isn't something that just
[1:18:41] happened. Oh, let there be a man. God
[1:18:44] thought about this. God had thoughts.
[1:18:48] And brother Brandham describes
[1:18:50] uh what kind of relationship they had
[1:18:54] and tells it in almost a not a
[1:18:56] melancholy way but such a uh a
[1:19:00] descriptive way
[1:19:02] of how God in his relationship with Adam
[1:19:05] and Adam and Eve and lay him to bed. And
[1:19:09] he describes it like, you know, I and my
[1:19:11] wife, he said, we go and we lay our son
[1:19:15] Joseph down and we look at him and and
[1:19:18] he says, you know, maybe she'll say,
[1:19:22] well, he has eyes just like you, dear.
[1:19:25] And uh he say, well, you know, he has he
[1:19:29] really looks like you. It has such an
[1:19:31] expression of your face or your mouth or
[1:19:33] something. and and and they say, you
[1:19:36] know, it's just such a kind of a warm
[1:19:38] feeling because you're looking at an
[1:19:40] expression of your own self. He talks
[1:19:43] about God taking Adam and Eve like just,
[1:19:46] you know, tucking him in at night. And
[1:19:48] he says how his heart must have felt
[1:19:51] when he looked upon them and saw that
[1:19:53] that was just an expression of himself,
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; eternal God. I mean, it wasn't it wasn't
[1:20:00] you and I bringing forth children or you
[1:20:02] that have families. It wasn't you and I
[1:20:05] bringing something not knowing what's it
[1:20:07] going to look like and what kind of ears
[1:20:08] it's going to have and what kind of
[1:20:10] hands and fingers it's going to have.
[1:20:11] Nothing. God knew what it was going to
[1:20:13] be like.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; And God designed it way ahead of time.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; And when he saw it, then it came in
[1:20:21] something he could have fellowship with.
[1:20:23] And he was bringing his thoughts higher
[1:20:26] and higher and higher from the creatures
[1:20:30] of the earth and and all of creation. He
[1:20:33] is a creator and the creator is bringing
[1:20:36] higher and higher to finally have
[1:20:39] something that looks like him. Oh, what
[1:20:44] it what it meant to him to bring that
[1:20:46] into being. Now, friends, on Sunday,
[1:20:50] Lord willing, I I want you to know we
[1:20:53] talk about a bride being created. God
[1:20:57] didn't just that was not just an
[1:20:59] afterthought.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:03] using individuals, not just an
[1:21:05] afterthought.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; God had this in his mind back into the
[1:21:10] eternities to think exactly what it was
[1:21:14] going to be like. Every member, what
[1:21:15] they're going to be like, and he chose
[1:21:17] it.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; He selected it.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; And let it be known to us, that'll be a
[1:21:24] problem. And it's always going to be a
[1:21:26] problem because that is something that
[1:21:29] the world at large is irritated with
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; and we'll never be able to recover from
[1:21:34] that. That happens to be a fact. That's
[1:21:36] an established fact. We're going to live
[1:21:38] it throughout our life and go out in a
[1:21:41] sweep of glory and the world is still
[1:21:43] Jesus said it hated you because it hated
[1:21:46] me
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; and it hated him because he was the word
[1:21:50] and hates the bride because she's the
[1:21:52] word.
[1:21:53] hated for exactly the same reason.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Just so you can see where I'm going.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; So now these were his uh creative
[1:22:06] thoughts, creation thoughts, thoughts of
[1:22:08] creation.
[1:22:10] He said in the message, I will restore.
[1:22:12] Now in the beginning when God made man
[1:22:15] in his image, the first man Adam was a
[1:22:19] man like God.
[1:22:22] He was a spirit man. Then we later on
[1:22:26] find after he'd made man in his image,
[1:22:29] there was no man to till the soil. So he
[1:22:32] put man in five senses to contact his
[1:22:36] earthly home.
[1:22:39] This is what he also did through the Old
[1:22:41] Testament.
[1:22:42] Did the same thing. Now it's I'm just
[1:22:44] taking a I I I just took like a model
[1:22:48] form there. This is what he did to bring
[1:22:50] one man. It was a contemplative thought.
[1:22:53] It was a a a purpose that God had in his
[1:22:56] mind. And he began, "Oh my, I tried
[1:23:00] today just to let my mind and my whole
[1:23:03] being go and and to think about
[1:23:08] and I just I love getting lost in my
[1:23:10] thoughts to think about this great great
[1:23:15] father, this God.
[1:23:18] I try to think about
[1:23:20] his power,
[1:23:23] his greatness, his holy,
[1:23:25] his magnificence.
[1:23:27] I try to let that affect me and to think
[1:23:30] that and and when I think about that, I
[1:23:32] think about how insignificant we are and
[1:23:35] I try to bridge that gap. And yet that
[1:23:37] God,
[1:23:39] he dains to stoop down
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; and wants to fellowship with me, want to
[1:23:43] fellowship with you. that that's that's
[1:23:45] sometime but that's where our believing
[1:23:47] has to come in. That's when you have to
[1:23:49] believe it.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Now there's a certain part of the earth
[1:23:56] I'm speaking almost you almost need your
[1:24:00] your imagination a wee bit now. So now
[1:24:03] God think in terms not of people so much
[1:24:06] but think in terms of God.
[1:24:10] He brought this earth into being. when
[1:24:12] he was bringing all of this into being
[1:24:15] and brother Ram talks about us and our
[1:24:17] bodies and the the elements that it's
[1:24:19] made out of 16 elements and so on and
[1:24:21] and when he he brought these elements
[1:24:23] from different places and so on and and
[1:24:26] was even making and forming an earth
[1:24:29] when he was doing that he was thinking
[1:24:30] of of you as an individual he was
[1:24:33] thinking of the very body that you're
[1:24:35] going to sit in you know this takes it
[1:24:37] out of the completely out of the
[1:24:40] mechanism of our birth by a sexual
[1:24:44] relationship.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; We had to come that way. But that was
[1:24:48] not the chosen way.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; And it takes it completely out of that.
[1:24:52] When you think when God in his great
[1:24:55] mind, he was not thinking of us coming
[1:24:57] down with all of our, you know,
[1:24:59] complexities and our, you know,
[1:25:02] complications of human life. That was
[1:25:05] not what was God was occupying his mind.
[1:25:08] He was thinking of sons and daughters
[1:25:11] like him.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; In the masterpiece,
[1:25:19] brother Brandham said, "He so perfected
[1:25:21] a redeemer," speaking of Christ, and
[1:25:24] I'll come to that in a moment. He so
[1:25:25] perfected a redeemer of man, so perfect,
[1:25:30] so godly.
[1:25:32] when this virgin-born son of the living
[1:25:35] God become so perfect and humble and in
[1:25:39] the image of God until the great master
[1:25:42] who had brought his life up through the
[1:25:44] prophets notice now he brought his life
[1:25:47] up that's why I stepped to Christ
[1:25:49] because it goes back say how it happened
[1:25:51] he brought his life up
[1:25:54] so perfect
[1:25:57] so absolutely perfect this redeemer of
[1:26:00] man and he brought him up through so
[1:26:03] humble but he brought him up his life up
[1:26:07] through the prophets and he was the
[1:26:09] fulfilling of all of the prophets.
[1:26:13] So now please stay with me. So now
[1:26:17] here's a here's here's the prophet and
[1:26:19] here's the people of that age and here's
[1:26:21] the saints of the Old Testament because
[1:26:23] God chose uh all humanity came out of
[1:26:27] the earth.
[1:26:30] All right? All humans came out of the
[1:26:32] earth in a physical body. But now God,
[1:26:36] just like he stooped down and took a
[1:26:38] certain part of the earth and made a
[1:26:40] man, Adam, now he he looks upon all
[1:26:43] humanity and he looks down and he
[1:26:46] chooses just a certain part of that
[1:26:48] clay. And he says, "Now this will be
[1:26:52] Abraham. And out of your seed is going
[1:26:55] to come forth a people." He knew they
[1:26:57] would become a nation. And these now
[1:27:00] this is going to be a certain part of
[1:27:02] all of the earth, all of the clay, all
[1:27:05] the human bodies that came up. All of us
[1:27:07] came up out of the earth. We're just
[1:27:10] part of the soil that's been transferred
[1:27:12] into a different form
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; for a short time and then this body is
[1:27:17] going to go back to dust again.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; And so God chose just a certain part of
[1:27:24] the earth, the clay. It's now in a
[1:27:26] higher form, but he chose it and said,
[1:27:28] "You're going to be my people."
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to use you just like he
[1:27:36] used the clay that he molded and made
[1:27:37] for Adam and breathed into him. And Adam
[1:27:40] became a living soul. And he became the
[1:27:44] he became the expression on earth of the
[1:27:46] invisible God.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; And God took a piece of clay and and
[1:27:50] breathed that into him. that image that
[1:27:53] he had made of himself, breathed it into
[1:27:55] him. Now he takes a whole because they
[1:27:58] fell. His bride fell. Now he takes a
[1:28:02] whole group of people that also are part
[1:28:04] of the earth that just came into a
[1:28:06] higher form.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Good
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; through the sexual birth, a natural
[1:28:12] human birth. But he chooses that fallen
[1:28:15] earth, that clay, corrupted clay,
[1:28:19] because out of that, he's going to
[1:28:21] choose one here. He's going to choose an
[1:28:23] Abraham. He's going to choose a Sarah.
[1:28:26] He's going to choose Isaac. He's going
[1:28:28] to choose a Jacob. Going to choose a
[1:28:31] Joseph. And so Jacob was a deceiver. And
[1:28:34] and uh and Isaac Isaac told a lie.
[1:28:36] Abraham told a lie. And and that was
[1:28:40] irrespective of that, God chose them.
[1:28:43] God chose them for a specific purpose
[1:28:46] and a specific objective. But the
[1:28:48] nations of the world were aggravated
[1:28:50] with that choice,
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; irritated with that choice. It it it
[1:28:55] ground on them.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; And the fact that they are to have a
[1:28:59] land, the fact God did when he made a
[1:29:01] choice of the people, he also made a
[1:29:03] choice of a place. Says, "You're the
[1:29:05] people and this is where you're going to
[1:29:07] be and I'm giving it to you." And that
[1:29:09] was an irritation way back there and
[1:29:11] still an irritation
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; for one reason. It was God's choice.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; The choice is the problem. The selection
[1:29:21] of God is the problem. And if and and
[1:29:24] anybody ought to see it. It's it's it's
[1:29:26] it's his archeneemy, Satan, who's in
[1:29:30] opposition to anything God chooses
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; or anybody that God chooses. He's in
[1:29:36] opposition or anything that God speaks.
[1:29:39] And so when God speaks truth, the world
[1:29:41] is opposed to it.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; They're in opposition to it. It
[1:29:44] irritates them.
[1:29:46] [Music]
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Because when God speaks, that's the only
[1:29:50] word.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; When God gives a message, that's the
[1:29:53] only message.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; When God chooses a person, that's the
[1:29:56] only person.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; It's not just this one and and 50 50
[1:30:02] more that'll line up. That's the only
[1:30:03] person. And God says, "You're going to
[1:30:06] do this." He's the only one that's going
[1:30:08] to do it
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to raise you up for a
[1:30:10] generation. He's the only one that God's
[1:30:12] going to use that generation. And so now
[1:30:15] we move along and he's got a group of
[1:30:17] people and and out of that out of that
[1:30:19] group of people comes comes a prophet
[1:30:21] and comes men and women and God chose
[1:30:24] them at different levels to do specific
[1:30:28] things. and brings a Moses, brings a
[1:30:31] Samuel, brings a David, and he brings
[1:30:34] kings and he brings prophets and minor
[1:30:36] prophets and brings them. And they all
[1:30:38] have their particular station and and
[1:30:41] out of this earth when one of them lived
[1:30:44] his life which was the word for that
[1:30:48] season. Please hang on close. Now, when
[1:30:50] that prophet, brother Brandham said, now
[1:30:53] they they were bringing forth Christ. So
[1:30:56] when that prophet lived his portion of
[1:30:59] word for that time and was done, it was
[1:31:02] completed. A part of Christ was formed.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; And then the next one came and another p
[1:31:10] another part of Christ was formed. And
[1:31:12] Christ was being formed formed all down.
[1:31:15] And finally here he emerged and came on
[1:31:17] the scene.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; The perfect son of God. But he had been
[1:31:22] in formation all through God forming
[1:31:24] him, forming him, molding him.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; So he had to be rejected in Samuel
[1:31:30] because he was going to be rejected. He
[1:31:31] had to be spit on in David cuz he was
[1:31:33] going to be spit on. He had to be a
[1:31:35] father like Abraham was a father. He had
[1:31:38] to be all of those things. And he
[1:31:40] because God was forming him all through
[1:31:42] that. And that's why his masterpiece had
[1:31:44] to have the had to have the foundations
[1:31:46] of Abraham in faith and Isaac and Jacob
[1:31:50] and grace and and and Joseph in
[1:31:53] perfection. And he's building on his
[1:31:55] form and brings forth his son,
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; one that was just like him
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; out of the earth.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; And he came in a body of earth. He had
[1:32:07] to come in a body of earth because he
[1:32:09] had to take now the the word because he
[1:32:12] was and the scripture says he was made
[1:32:16] the word. Now he's formed by the word
[1:32:21] and he's made the word and the word was
[1:32:25] made flesh.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I want to get get your
[1:32:31] mind away from the fact he was just made
[1:32:33] flesh and he was formed in the womb of
[1:32:34] Mary. That wasn't it.
[1:32:36] That was just the kind of the final act.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; He was formed all through the centuries
[1:32:42] from that that piece of clay called
[1:32:45] Hebrew children.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; And up out of that Hebrew children came
[1:32:51] Christ being formed and formed and
[1:32:54] formed and part of the word. And when
[1:32:56] the word was fulfilled, it was laid
[1:32:59] down. It was already it was already a
[1:33:02] fact. It was a part of Christ. And
[1:33:04] that's why brother Bram said it was
[1:33:05] Christ in Noah.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; It's Christ in Abraham.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; It's Christ in David.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; It's Christ in Isaiah.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Is Christ in. And when that man lived
[1:33:15] his life, he was chosen of God. That
[1:33:17] piece of clay chosen of God to live out
[1:33:20] a certain part of the word. And when it
[1:33:22] was laid down, the Messiah, the
[1:33:24] redeemer, everything was formed. Yes.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; And then finally the time came when when
[1:33:31] a a little virgin believed.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; And then there was a conception in her
[1:33:37] womb and she brought forth a body
[1:33:40] because now the word had to take the
[1:33:43] body as a sacrifice to Calvary.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; And so it was the word in him and he
[1:33:49] lived a very short life but the word the
[1:33:52] word in him walked him. Amen.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; To Calvary.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I I read today and how how the
[1:34:00] prophet describes him. He was born in a
[1:34:02] stable
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; because he was a lamb.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; He was led He was led to the slaughter
[1:34:10] with a rope around him because because
[1:34:14] sheep and lambs are led by with a rope
[1:34:18] around him. Everything about him was a
[1:34:21] lamb. But he had been formed that all
[1:34:24] through the centuries. And now this was
[1:34:26] the kind of the concluding climactic act
[1:34:30] of his life because he had to take the
[1:34:34] flesh as a sacrifice and bring this
[1:34:37] cursed earth.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:40] had to bring this cursed earth to
[1:34:42] Calvary and let men who are already
[1:34:46] under judgment uh condemn him and kill
[1:34:51] him and go to the go to the tomb. But it
[1:34:54] was not possible because he was the word
[1:34:57] in flesh. It was not possible that he
[1:34:59] would that he would see corruption. And
[1:35:01] the spirit of God moved upon him and he
[1:35:04] raised up out of the tomb victorious
[1:35:07] over death, hell, and the grave.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; God's choice.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; But when he came and he began to
[1:35:18] express,
[1:35:20] you can't hide God's choosing
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; and he began because of his because of
[1:35:25] his choosing because he was the son of
[1:35:28] God.
[1:35:29] what he spoke
[1:35:31] took place and the others who couldn't
[1:35:34] do it.
[1:35:37] You see,
[1:35:40] I want you to see this.
[1:35:46] I would just give anything
[1:35:49] if I could transport this congregation
[1:35:52] this evening into one of brother
[1:35:54] Brandham's meetings
[1:35:56] so you could see with your eyes and hear
[1:36:01] with your ears that voice and that you
[1:36:05] could be sitting where you're sitting
[1:36:08] and have you be singled out and
[1:36:12] something that's crushing on your heart
[1:36:15] like you called out a little woman and
[1:36:19] he was over in Europe, I believe in
[1:36:20] Switzerland
[1:36:22] and he says, "You're holding that baby."
[1:36:25] He said, "You're have a desire something
[1:36:28] with that baby." But he says, "What you
[1:36:31] really need is salvation. You're not
[1:36:33] saved." And I thought, you know what,
[1:36:36] grace of God, a little young mother
[1:36:39] holding a baby, an infant that was in
[1:36:41] need of prayer, but here a messenger
[1:36:44] sent from heaven, sent from God, would
[1:36:46] deal with her soul and just simply just
[1:36:49] lead her to Christ right there.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; How marvelous.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Now, I would love to be able to do that
[1:37:01] here this evening, but you see, he was
[1:37:05] chosen for that.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; And if I even attempted it, I would be
[1:37:09] an impersonator.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; And the impersonators raised up.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Kora, Dayan, Abraham, all impersonators.
[1:37:17] And they were in this day as well. And
[1:37:19] when the choice of God came, all kinds
[1:37:22] of others came in said, "Well, I can do
[1:37:24] that.
[1:37:26] I can do that.
[1:37:30] See, even prayer lines. Prayer lines.
[1:37:32] Brother Brandon was the first that I
[1:37:34] ever heard of, even read of that had a
[1:37:36] prayer line.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; That that was a unique thing to one
[1:37:39] man's ministry.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Can I go on just a few more minutes?
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; So, he brought his life up through the
[1:37:52] prophets.
[1:37:54] He was so perfect until God seeing this
[1:37:56] he smoked him and said and he as he
[1:38:00] cried out speak as Michelangelo did
[1:38:02] speak he said you say is that so St.
[1:38:05] Mark 9 and7 we find upon the mount
[1:38:09] transfiguration when there stood Moses
[1:38:12] the law there stood Elijah the prophets
[1:38:15] so brother Brandham refers to mount
[1:38:17] transfiguration he says there stood the
[1:38:18] law and the prophets all the way back
[1:38:22] from the patriarchs
[1:38:24] the fathers the law and the prophets and
[1:38:28] all of them standing there we hear a
[1:38:31] voice coming down from the cloud said
[1:38:34] this is my beloved son, hear ye him. So
[1:38:38] he singles him out beyond the law and
[1:38:41] the prophets and the patriarchs and all
[1:38:44] of them,
[1:38:45] Peter, James, and John that were
[1:38:47] standing there, they were sons of the
[1:38:50] Hebrews.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; All they knew was the law and the
[1:38:53] prophets. Now, the voice that they
[1:38:56] heard, and Peter refers to it in his in
[1:38:59] his epistle, the voice that they heard
[1:39:02] singled out this one as a choosing even
[1:39:05] above all of that,
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; above every prophet, above every every
[1:39:10] patriarch. As great as Abraham was,
[1:39:13] here's one greater.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; A young man that they ate with.
[1:39:20] a young man
[1:39:22] 30 31 32 33 a young man that hey listen
[1:39:28] friends
[1:39:29] because it's historical that may seem
[1:39:32] simple to you try to pick out somebody
[1:39:35] in this day and age at this time and and
[1:39:38] that selection the fact that God chooses
[1:39:41] an individual that is a that is a real
[1:39:45] source of a of difficulty and and you
[1:39:48] need to be ready for that Right.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you're wrestling with it all
[1:39:52] the time, you know, to to be accepted
[1:39:54] and everything else. You might be
[1:39:56] accepted as an individual, but the thing
[1:39:58] you believe will never be accepted by
[1:39:59] the world.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; And that's one of the best things that
[1:40:03] you can just get and put that in your
[1:40:05] packs. What you believe will never be
[1:40:08] accepted by the world.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; It'll never be popular by the world. In
[1:40:13] fact, it's the fact that God even gave
[1:40:15] you the the kind of life you emulate,
[1:40:18] the kind of life you express, the kind
[1:40:20] of power that is there. It's just
[1:40:23] resident.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; You don't have to you don't have to try
[1:40:26] to generate it. It's just there.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; You have a certain appearance. It's just
[1:40:30] there.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; People know you're different right away.
[1:40:33] They may not be able to identify it, but
[1:40:35] they know it's different.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; And you'd think they would love it.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Right. They admire it at the same time
[1:40:42] irritated by it.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Am I getting right to the point?
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; See, all through life,
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; I'm restraining myself. I could preach,
[1:40:55] but I I'm I'm holding myself back all
[1:40:58] the way back from the patriarchs and the
[1:41:00] fathers and the law and the prophets
[1:41:02] standing there to hear a voice coming
[1:41:04] down from the cloud said, "This is my
[1:41:06] beloved son. Hear ye him." And if
[1:41:09] they're going to hear, listen to this
[1:41:11] closely. If they're going to hear, he's
[1:41:14] got to speak.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand's making a point because
[1:41:18] he wasn't just speaking back there 2,000
[1:41:20] years ago. The same one that was on the
[1:41:22] mountain was speaking today.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; That was God's choosing.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; He's got to speak. And if he's going to
[1:41:31] speak, if they're going to hear, he's
[1:41:33] got to speak. It was just a few days
[1:41:37] before he was smitten. This is my son
[1:41:40] whom I'm pleased to dwell in. I've
[1:41:43] molded him.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Not in 33 years only. He was molded
[1:41:48] because he was living out the reflection
[1:41:50] of all of those people. Amen.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; I like what someone said and I can't say
[1:41:54] it exactly as they did but they said
[1:41:57] here this this loaf
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; this bread of life was ground
[1:42:05] through the suffering of humanity. He
[1:42:08] was ground so fine to make the flour
[1:42:12] that could make the loaf a living loaf a
[1:42:15] living bread
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; for us to eat and partake of.
[1:42:21] I've molded him. I've been 4,000 years.
[1:42:25] Now, see, I I want you to understand
[1:42:27] this message just isn't my thought. I've
[1:42:29] been 4,000 years bringing him to this.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Not 33 years. I've been 4,000 years
[1:42:39] bringing him to this. The son of God,
[1:42:42] the second Adam, being molded out of the
[1:42:45] earth after the earth had come to a
[1:42:48] higher form. It wasn't just dirt laying
[1:42:52] there anymore, but now it had come into
[1:42:53] humanity. But God's choosing is all the
[1:42:56] way along. God making his choice.
[1:43:00] And he perfected one, his masterpiece.
[1:43:04] Now, I'm going to be just about 5
[1:43:06] minutes. I'm just going to close.
[1:43:08] And God said, "Let us make man in our
[1:43:13] image, after our likeness, and let them
[1:43:16] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[1:43:18] and over the fowl of the air, and over
[1:43:21] the cattle, and over the earth, and over
[1:43:23] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[1:43:25] the earth." So God created man in his
[1:43:30] own image, in the image of God, created
[1:43:32] he him, male and female created he them.
[1:43:38] In the identified masterpiece, he said,
[1:43:40] "Now, and when he made Adam, that first
[1:43:43] man, how perfect it was. He looked like
[1:43:48] God."
[1:43:50] I want to just study this. He and he
[1:43:54] made man in his own image. And um I
[1:43:57] probably won't get into it completely.
[1:44:00] Uh but um I want to bring one thought
[1:44:03] because this word, let us make man in
[1:44:06] our own image. The Bible also says, "And
[1:44:09] God said, let the earth bring forth
[1:44:11] grass and herb yielding seed,
[1:44:15] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[1:44:19] his kind, whose seed is in itself upon
[1:44:22] the earth." And it was so. I'd love to
[1:44:23] have had this on the uh on the uh
[1:44:26] screen. Perhaps I can do it for Sunday
[1:44:28] morning. But when the scripture says,
[1:44:30] and you can read it at Genesis 1:11, and
[1:44:33] God said, "Let the earth bring forth
[1:44:35] grass, the herb yielding seed,
[1:44:42] and
[1:44:43] the fruit tree yielding fruit, and the
[1:44:47] yielding of the seed, and the yielding
[1:44:49] of the fruit, two different words
[1:44:51] completely.
[1:44:53] And the one yielding
[1:44:56] is to to sew
[1:45:00] to seow seed or to produce
[1:45:04] uh yielding of seed.
[1:45:07] But the other one is exactly
[1:45:10] as when God said, "Let us make man."
[1:45:14] Let us make man. Just hold it now. And
[1:45:18] that one is yielding fruit.
[1:45:22] yielding fruit. Yielding in the same
[1:45:25] word is make. Let us make man. In other
[1:45:28] words, man will be yielding or bringing
[1:45:31] forth fruit. Let us make man in our
[1:45:34] image because God was one that was
[1:45:37] bringing forth. God was fruitful. God
[1:45:41] was bringing forth a children and that
[1:45:44] was that was indicating I want you to
[1:45:46] get this now as I close. God was he was
[1:45:50] giving a powerful statement. Let us make
[1:45:53] man not just to produce seed that would
[1:45:57] be scattered but to produce fruit. He's
[1:46:00] going to produce fruit. And then he says
[1:46:02] to the tree you'll yield and make
[1:46:06] yielding seed. That's like to be sown
[1:46:10] but you will yield fruit.
[1:46:13] And actually in the Hebrew it was even
[1:46:16] to become pregnant. It's actually
[1:46:18] written right in the in the in the
[1:46:20] dictionary actually to be become
[1:46:22] pregnant. You will actually yield fruit.
[1:46:25] And so now in this making let us make
[1:46:28] man. And I'll just stop here now because
[1:46:31] I want to take some time on Sunday
[1:46:33] morning
[1:46:35] because God
[1:46:37] God in his making I I I want I want to
[1:46:42] bear this uh and and bring this so make
[1:46:46] it so emphatic for the people because I
[1:46:49] want you to enlarge
[1:46:52] your belief, enlarge your scope
[1:46:56] of understanding of your presence here
[1:47:01] and to let you know that God had this in
[1:47:04] mind and the Bible is saying I want you
[1:47:08] to be occupied with this thought.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; I want you to believe on him whom God
[1:47:15] hath sent and I have not found any
[1:47:18] message that so takes us as believers.
[1:47:22] Where did you hear it before? You came
[1:47:24] from a multitude of churches. Where did
[1:47:26] you hear before? You came from the
[1:47:29] thoughts of God. From the mind of God.
[1:47:34] So, we're not just go back 4,000 years,
[1:47:36] but go back into the very mind and
[1:47:39] thoughts of God. And what did God think
[1:47:42] when he was thinking about you sitting
[1:47:45] here this evening? I want you to go home
[1:47:47] thinking about that. What did God think
[1:47:49] about? What did God have in mind? What
[1:47:52] was his purpose? What was his objective?
[1:47:55] Why did he allow me to come to this age?
[1:47:58] What what what purpose do I have on the
[1:48:01] earth? God knows why I'm here.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; God has designed this whole thing.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; This has been definitive in the mind of
[1:48:12] God. He knew precisely what he wanted me
[1:48:15] to do. And I'm here. And now I've heard
[1:48:19] the message that he sent. and I believe
[1:48:22] on him whom God has sent. Oh, you stand
[1:48:26] in a tremendous a tremendous uh
[1:48:29] benefited place to believe on him whom
[1:48:32] God hath sent because now think about
[1:48:35] God's choosing
[1:48:37] a messenger.
[1:48:39] You know something friends, brother
[1:48:42] Brham's language when he first started
[1:48:44] to bring the message, he used language
[1:48:47] concerning like the promiscuous society
[1:48:50] which we've become so acquainted with.
[1:48:52] But he used it and he spoke about those
[1:48:54] things that caused us as ministers and
[1:48:57] myself included to cringe
[1:49:01] because there were it was terminology
[1:49:03] that wasn't used over the pullpit
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; when he spoke about the serpent seed and
[1:49:07] spoke about things so openly. He was way
[1:49:10] ahead of his time.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; God God crafted him.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; God chose him. God gave him the
[1:49:20] vocabulary.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; He spoke about tectonics and the crust
[1:49:26] of the earth and and the movement and
[1:49:29] the shifting of it like like scientists.
[1:49:32] In fact, there's a scientist told me,
[1:49:33] "We only thought of that in our bedrooms
[1:49:36] until about 1977."
[1:49:39] And here he's speaking about it back in
[1:49:41] the 60s and the late 50s, talking about
[1:49:45] the the the injured cell from a wound
[1:49:48] and how a cell goes wild and describes a
[1:49:50] cancer, describes the tumor, describes
[1:49:53] its roots and how it dries up and all of
[1:49:56] these things. He like like he was a a
[1:49:58] medical uh physician of some sort.
[1:50:02] spoke about the science and the universe
[1:50:05] and and how the planets and their
[1:50:07] rotation and all those things in the
[1:50:09] earth how it tipped at one time and
[1:50:12] changed the whole planet system of our
[1:50:15] planet.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Like he was a like he was a scientist.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Where did that wisdom come from?
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; A seventh grade educated Kuckian. Never.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; It was the molding of God.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; It was the education of God.
[1:50:30] come out of God's school.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Where did John the Baptist get all this?
[1:50:35] Where'd he get it? Out in the
[1:50:36] wilderness. Absolutely. Where God, he
[1:50:39] was educated by God.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; And you and I have become the
[1:50:43] beneficiaries of such a thing, such a
[1:50:45] choosing,
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; such a message,
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, you you have things
[1:50:51] on your on your walls that they haven't
[1:50:53] got in the in the museums of this land.
[1:50:57] That's right.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; You might cower when I say that. You
[1:51:01] might say, "Well, should we think that?"
[1:51:02] I think that you should.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; And I think you ought to occupy yourself
[1:51:07] with God's choosing.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; God has chosen
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; us to be an example.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; And it's not my business who else he
[1:51:16] chose or who he doesn't choose. And
[1:51:18] that's one of the things we face soon as
[1:51:19] people become believers. What about
[1:51:21] them? Or what about this one? What about
[1:51:23] them? They're good people. We have
[1:51:25] nothing to say about that. wonderful
[1:51:27] people, fine people, and then you have a
[1:51:30] messenger saying it's such a comfort to
[1:51:32] it's not the people, it's the system
[1:51:33] that that's that's holding them.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; But I think I've actually made my point
[1:51:41] tonight.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; We're on God's choosing,
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; the chosen of God.
[1:51:47] something that just cannot be popular
[1:51:51] and something that cannot be accepted by
[1:51:54] the general population, the general
[1:51:56] public and whoever hears this because
[1:51:59] you see I don't have I don't have I'm
[1:52:01] not one to say it's just God choosing
[1:52:03] within these four walls. I don't know
[1:52:05] who he chooses, but I know one thing. He
[1:52:07] chose me to hear what I've heard. And
[1:52:09] what I've heard has been a transforming
[1:52:11] power in my life. And I know one thing
[1:52:14] even by scientific by the scientific
[1:52:17] things that God has allowed us that this
[1:52:19] messenger came and truth came out of his
[1:52:22] mouth.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; And truth is what we need.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:32] We've been appointed to this certain
[1:52:34] time, friends,
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; so you think you have something to go
[1:52:38] home with and think about
[1:52:40] [Music]
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; till Sunday. Sunday, Lord willing, I
[1:52:45] want to take the rest of it now cuz I've
[1:52:47] just laid a foundation, bit of
[1:52:50] foundation. I want to go from there and
[1:52:52] and preach you on you have to forgive
[1:52:55] me. You know, I stumbled around a we bit
[1:52:56] cuz I'm trying to hold myself back and I
[1:52:59] feel like a racehorse that's been, you
[1:53:01] know, crippled and put big big weights
[1:53:04] on its legs so it can't move about. And
[1:53:07] you've been good. You've been quiet. You
[1:53:08] haven't said sickum too many times. So,
[1:53:11] all right. God bless you. We thank him.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank him for this word. I thank
[1:53:17] him for this message.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; It's just wonderful.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Why don't we just stand, shall we?
[1:53:26] Lord, we're here tonight
[1:53:28] to give you thanksgiving.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; How we thank you, oh God. You're the
[1:53:33] author of salvation,
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; the author of eternal life.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; You've brought forth Jesus Christ. And
[1:53:40] Lord, we've just finished celebrating
[1:53:42] and remembering a an Easter time, but
[1:53:45] Lord, the world, what do they know about
[1:53:48] it? you know, some bonnets or bunnies or
[1:53:52] chicks or something. What a disgrace.
[1:53:55] What a shame. Oh, God. Such a glorious
[1:53:58] thing. Up from the grave he arose.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Victory. Victorious over all of his
[1:54:05] foes. How we rejoice tonight because we
[1:54:08] raised with him. Your messenger said we
[1:54:10] raised with him. We are now resurrected.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. We're not down in the
[1:54:17] doldrums, down in the in the gloom of
[1:54:19] this world, but we've been raised in a
[1:54:22] resurrection. We've been beneficiaries
[1:54:24] of it. And you've waved over us this
[1:54:27] wave shave. How we bless your name
[1:54:30] tonight. Lord, thank you for this
[1:54:32] attention, the congregation, the keen
[1:54:34] interest, the desire that they have to
[1:54:37] hear, to hear your word, to lodge it in
[1:54:40] their heart. And I pray oh God that you
[1:54:43] will take it and let it be just a
[1:54:45] profusion of life. Let it become
[1:54:48] fruitful in their life. Give us oh God a
[1:54:51] glorious time in the coming days and
[1:54:54] bring us together on the appointed time
[1:54:57] on the Lord's day. We'll be here to
[1:54:59] worship you Lord. We'll be here to give
[1:55:01] you praise. We thank you for it. We
[1:55:04] dedicate ourselves and our lives to you
[1:55:06] and in your service in Jesus Christ's
[1:55:09] name. Make us a real witness in the
[1:55:11] testimony, oh God. And we rejoice in
[1:55:13] your selection. We rejoice in your
[1:55:16] choosing, oh God. We rejoice that it's
[1:55:18] no good thing that we have done. It is
[1:55:20] grace, grace, amazing grace. We bless
[1:55:23] your name. We praise your holy name.
[1:55:26] Amen. And amen. I think we'll just sing
[1:55:29] the old song. Amazing grace. How sweet
[1:55:32] the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[1:55:35] Could you lift it up and mean every word
[1:55:37] of it? I'm sure you can. Amazing
[1:55:41] [Music]

[1:57:30] [Music]
[1:57:33] Dear Father,
[1:57:35] we do not know what tomorrow holds,
[1:57:38] but we know that you have it in your
[1:57:40] hand. You have every life in your hand.
[1:57:44] You have our breath in your hand. And
[1:57:48] Lord, we pray that because you know the
[1:57:51] beginning from the end, we just commit
[1:57:54] ourselves to you. Each one. And I'm
[1:57:56] praying on behalf of each one that's
[1:57:58] within the sound of my voice in this
[1:58:00] building tonight. Lord, those that are
[1:58:02] streaming, oh God, give them a glimpse.
[1:58:06] I pray give us all give me a glimpse
[1:58:09] Lord just by faith by the six sense that
[1:58:12] I might be able to just look and peer
[1:58:15] and see a little more see a little
[1:58:17] broader scope of what your plan and what
[1:58:21] you've prepared for them that love you.
[1:58:24] Oh Lord I can say tonight we love your
[1:58:27] appearing. We love what we've seen. We
[1:58:30] love your presence, Lord. And we want
[1:58:33] you just to make yourself even more
[1:58:34] evident, more evident, Lord, nearer to
[1:58:38] us, oh God. Bring your mighty works
[1:58:41] amongst us, Father. Hear the prayers
[1:58:43] that have been prayed tonight, Lord. And
[1:58:46] the prayers that were prayed throughout
[1:58:48] the day, oh God. They've entered in and
[1:58:50] there are incense rising up before you.
[1:58:54] Oh God, come and glorify yourself
[1:58:57] amongst us. We'll be very very careful
[1:58:59] to give you all the praise there. No
[1:59:01] flesh will glory in your presence. No
[1:59:04] minister Lord will glory in your
[1:59:05] presence. We set ourselves aside. Oh
[1:59:08] Lord Jesus, be glorified. Be glorified.
[1:59:13] Oh Lord, come amongst us and be
[1:59:15] glorified. Oh, your name is worthy. It's
[1:59:18] the only worthy name. Lord Jesus, as we
[1:59:21] go, may your name be upon our lips. And
[1:59:24] may we, oh God, think of the words that
[1:59:26] were uttered from heaven. This is my
[1:59:28] beloved son. Hear ye him,
[1:59:32] oh Lord, that you have allowed us,
[1:59:36] allowed us this honor, this privilege,
[1:59:39] this position that you have brought us
[1:59:42] to. And now that we can be a voice on
[1:59:45] your behalf. Oh God, make us faithful.
[1:59:48] Let us be a voice. Though the world may
[1:59:51] not want to hear it, yet we will speak
[1:59:52] it. We will continue to say it. We will
[1:59:55] continue to live it by the power of the
[1:59:58] Holy Spirit. Send your spirit mightily
[2:00:01] upon us, oh God. I pray in the name of
[2:00:03] Jesus Christ, if there's one here or
[2:00:06] more that have not been baptized and
[2:00:08] filled with your Holy Spirit. Send your
[2:00:11] spirit upon them. Even now, oh God,
[2:00:13] create such a hunger within their heart
[2:00:15] that they can't shake it. They will call
[2:00:17] out to you. Oh God, fill me or I die.
[2:00:20] Fill me. I cannot continue on. I pray
[2:00:23] you'll fill them, Lord. Fill them to
[2:00:25] overflowing and give us all another
[2:00:27] baptism. I pray, oh God, don't let us be
[2:00:30] satisfied with where we were yesterday
[2:00:33] or where we were today. Oh God, don't
[2:00:35] let us be satisfied. I pray this thirst
[2:00:38] will become so great it'll become
[2:00:40] painful. Let us hunger and thirst after
[2:00:43] righteousness. Bless this congregation,
[2:00:45] Lord, as we part ways and go from this
[2:00:48] place. May your presence continue with
[2:00:50] us in the name of Jesus Christ for your
[2:00:55] glory. We thank you, Lord. We thank you,
[2:00:58] Lord. We thank you, Lord. Oh, I'm here
[2:01:02] to praise you, Lord. We're here to give
[2:01:04] you praise. What a lovely name, the name
[2:01:07] of Jesus. Oh, we bless your name, Lord.
[2:01:10] That's so good to our souls, Lord. We
[2:01:12] feel such a release. We feel such a joy
[2:01:15] when we can open our mouth and give vent
[2:01:17] to what's in our soul, Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:01:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:01:24] Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah.
[2:01:30] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank
[2:01:32] you, Lord.

[2:01:39] journey on our ways home
[2:01:43] for your glory in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for your attention
[2:01:50] and your eager interest in the word. I
[2:01:53] appreciate that. You're dismissed in
[2:01:55] Jesus name. God with you till we see you
[2:01:58] again. Amen.
