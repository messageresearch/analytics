AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them saying what think ye of Christ who son is he and they said unto him the son of David and he said unto them how then does David in spirit call him Lord saying the Lord said unto my Lord set thou on my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footstool if David then call him Lord how is he his son and no man was able to answer him a word neither do any man from that day forth asked him any more questions may he add His blessings to that word and now for a few moments I'd like to take this if you'd call it a text um what than ye of Christ had you seen all these meetings and everything what do you think of Christ whose son is he that's been a an old dispute Through the Ages through the scientists and through the the evolutionists and so forth what was Christ who was he and and it's just as simple as the question is which was first the hen of the egg you've heard that what the hen come from the egg and which is first hen of egg well the hen was God made the hen the hen laid the egg now that's the same thing about the scientific research of the bloodstream of Jesus Christ Christ was the Virgin born son of God see and a scientist once told me not speaking science because my brother's here but there was a scientist once went hunting with me out in the west and I met him and he was about to roughest fell I ever seen he said do you mean to tell me when I told him I was the preacher he said you look too intelligent to be there and I said well um I said well not disputing your words sir but I believe that's the mark of intelligence me said he said well anybody would believe such a story as that and I said well what do you mean he said well such as that virgin birth he said you you know you know better than that I said no sir I'll admit I don't know any better I said that's that's just all I know and he said well you mean to tell me that woman could have a baby without being so that was Joseph that man that she was going with is a little slip up like we have all time I said oh no God makes no slip ups that was absolutely God Son he said well there is no such a thing I said do you mean there's not a Creator who made the heavens and earth he said no of course not he said oh it's psychology I said well how'd the world get here said it was here when I come here I said yes that's right in the room you was born in was there when you got there and the furniture was arranged but some intelligent had to arrange it that way that's exact why it would be silly so I say well how'd that watch come well it's just a watch that's all it just happened to be a watch well now the timing the jewels and everything anybody was with mentally balanced right would know that some intelligent made that watch had to time it and regulate it and put the hands and jewels and the operations well then how much greater is your body than this watch see because it was a man that made this watch and somebody had to make the man so a person says that we just happen to be that shows there's a mental deficiency somewhere that's right so he said well now you begin to tell me the ethics of Darwin and so forth about how Evolution came into existence how the world and the Sun and the Moon you've read it perhaps Had A Love Affair and chipped off a little piece and flew off and that made the world and the first man was a sponge and he wore a little Ward on this side and Out Come an arm and then he decided he want a little arm on the other side so it rolled a few thousand years over on that side another Arm come out I said look fell I'm kind of weak and Fai I said I I don't believe that I can't believe it I said I just be wa God said it was I said the only way you can prove that by faith you can't prove it any other way I said my Faith's too weak for that I said I just I haven't got that much faith I just believe that God made it way he said he did and he said I said he said all about the Virgin bir he said it's it's proven Reverend Brown that that corn everything else has to have a poen the poins and the corn and for the trees and the how the bees pack it and everything has to have actual male and female I said sure it was a male in this respect I said that was God well is God a man I said God's the spirit oh impossible to contact the actual human being it has to be the sex part I said oh no I said now look you will admit to me will you that the woman had the baby we'll say that that was right the woman had the baby and he was Jesus yes that that I'll go with you that part because there's some kind of a something going on through the world and to come down history and so forth that there was one here called Jesus but he was no virgin born I said then we'll admit that he had a natural mother yes now he in your estimation he' have to have an a actual father a Earthly man here to be his father or he could not have been born he said that's exactly right I said will you stick with that Mr je he said I will I said all right I want to ask you something then if if this woman had the baby and you said it was impossible it had to have a natural father it had to have an Earthly father as same as it had Earth mother said that's exactly truth I said then how did the first man get here without father or mother or did he come from let he be tadp monkey whatever he want to be according to science he had to have a father and a mother is that right I said who was his father and mother well he asked no more questions from that time saying just settled it their argument is thinner than the broth made out of a shadow of a chicken is star today they haven't got a leg to stand on no sir Jesus Christ was the son of God
