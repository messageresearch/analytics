Says, "As children and offering to thee the praises of our lips, oh maybe not orderly, Lord, but it's just children. You understand it.

Dad just needs a revelation and healing in his body. Sister Judy Davis uh needs a miracle as well and needs a deliverance from constant pain. And uh I want to remember brother Roger Monk's dad this morning as well. Had a minor stroke and so we want to be praying for him. If you've got a need this morning, whatever it would be, you just lift it before the Lord as we go to prayer. Amen. Doesn't matter how small it is or how big it is. We've got a God who's interested in all of our problems and all of our needs. Amen. Brother V, if you'd come, [Music] oh God, oh heavenly father, Lord, father, as we worship Lord, we felt your presence, Lord. Lord Jesus, your word says, Lord, that if there weren't anybody to praise you, Lord, the rocks would cry out, Lord. Father, we're so thankful for these lively stones, Lord Jesus, that you poured your spirit into, Lord, that could worship you in spirit and in truth, Father. How we adore you, Lord. You deserve to be adored. Lord, how you set the set the captive free, Lord. We're sitting here, Lord, as your token, Lord, of what you've done in this hour, Lord Jesus. And Father God, we lift our hands in adoration and respect to the word of God this morning for what you've done in our lives. Lord, we're so thankful God. We worship you, Lord. We bless your holy name. Lord, we think of these prayers that Lord, that have come forth this morning. And Lord, our sister Judy, Lord, wanting us to join our hearts with her for her father. Oh God, would you go to him now, Lord? And father, would you visit him and will you pour revelation into his heart? Oh God, may you ever bring him close. Oh God, our precious sister Judy, Lord, has lived a life and has a right, Lord. And she's coming to your throne, Lord. And we bring these prayers before the cherubams, oh God. Would you go to him now, Lord, and send those that just your angels, Lord, and minister unto him, oh God. And Lord, we know that prayers are more powerful than any atomic bomb, Lord. Just go to the brother now, Lord. And minister to his heart. And this other sister Judy, Lord, don't know her. You know her, Father. In pain, oh God, you are the great physician. Oh Lord, go to her. Father, we pray. Oh God, may your hand touch her. Lord, may she touch the hem of your garment, oh God. Just go to her now. Lord, I think of my own wife, Lord, also in the same situation.

And you can have your seats. Want to welcome all those who are visiting with us and a particular welcome this morning to sister Ailen. It doesn't say what her last name is. Just wrote a note here.

Brother Ed's going to come. We got a my little granddaughter. And we just love to pieces. And we just uh so thankful for God to God for all that he's given us. states. We're not worthy, but we just continually thank him for many his many blessings. As Jar and Joanne come, let's sing again. We bless your name. We bless your name. We give you honor, Lord. We give you praise. We bless your name. We bless your name. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] the truth. We bless your name. We bless your name. And in everything we do, we bless his name. Whether it's in preaching the word, singing song, or dedicating a baby, dedicating a child. And brother Jeremy and Sister Joanna have brought their latest addition to the family and to the church, and we're really happy for that. Uh, I have some scriptures which actually pertain to a young man in the Bible, not even a child, but a young man. His name was Timothy. And Paul had uh just a an incredible relationship, I would say, with Timothy. Timothy had such a place in Paul's heart. And I just want to read these scriptures. and to Timothy, my beloved son. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father in Christ Jesus our Lord. I thank God whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day greatly desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that I may be filled with joy when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee that dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois. and in thy mother Ununice. And I'm persuaded that in thee also. And I got thinking about this scene that we have here today. And we're going to dedicate Elelliana Maurice. Did I say that right? Good. And uh but this didn't happen just uh this wasn't just an idea of brother Jeremy and sister Joanna's because uh the parents of both of these parents are here and so they contributed brother Peter and sister Barbiner and I believe that their faith has contributed to Joanna's faith &gt;&gt; and the faith of brother Jeremy. The faith of brother Rod and sister Cindy have contributed in rearing brother Jeremy to stand here. And then they too in faith. And brother Brandham said one place he said the faith of the parents have brought these children this baby. And the baby was in need of healing. But he was now tying it back to the faith of the parents have brought the child for the blessing of healing and you have brought this child for the blessing of dedication and giving it back to God. I also thought of where David had said that the children there are the heritage of the Lord literally they're the possession of the Lord. And so God has given this life, this jewel, Elelliana Maurice to you and you will care for her and God will wait patiently for his reward because it says that they are also his reward and she'll come to the age of accountability if time will go on and I am praying and that's the purpose of this time that her life will be a credit to the gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; That her life will be an example to other young people and that very early she'll begin to express this and then God will begin to get his reward. And so you, brother Jeremy and sister Joanna, I trust that you'll con always have this in your mind. This child has been lent to us, put in our care, and now we will raise her because this is God's possession, God's inheritance, and someday we want her to be a reward to him. Amen. Amen. I'll have you join with me in prayer. Heavenly Father, I hold and embrace this child, Elelliana Maurice. Oh God, uh I pray, Father, that she will always be uh within your supervision under your leadership. May your eyes always be on her. And I pray that good will follow her all the days of her life. I pray that she will have good health. I pray, Father, she'll have good understanding. I pray she'll have a real appetite for spiritual things. And may her heart yearn to know about Christ, about God. And I pray, Father, that you will take brothers Jeremy and sister Joanna and give them, dear Lord, the wisdom that they will need, the faith, the continued faith, Lord, that they will direct her footsteps in all the things of God, even from a very, very early child. May she come to know you, Lord. And then I pray that her life will be a grace to the gospel. I pray that it'll be an example of of the message that we believe and hold so dearly to our hearts. And now, Father, as you have given this jewel to brother Jeremy, Sister Joanna, now they stand here and we dedicate her back to you. We dedicate Elelliana Maurice in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you. God bless brother Jeremy. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Want to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. You've already been welcomed and heard the songs of worship and how wonderful that is. And it's just good to be in the house of God, isn't it? I received these greetings just a little bit too late to show you the picture, but our brother Jonathan Larga has just gotten married and brother Milco and uh brother Micah Dega were both over there uh representing us and participated in bringing greetings from us to them. And I sent an official note to brother Jonathan. His wife's name is Anna. and they sent an email back with some pictures, but I can't get the pictures to you this quickly. I just received it after I got here to the church. So, he wanted to send greetings to the congregation. They feel a connection and they stream all the meetings. So, they they they do know you uh and uh for those of you that uh met Jonathan and such a fine spirit, such an excellent spirit. And I can say that you you didn't know his father, but his father was uh you know they talk about the the unknown tongues in the Bible which on the unknown word is not there but it's languages and and Jonathan's father be he was so had such a uh he was just obsessed to get the message to his people and he began translating. He was a a former school teacher. He was a school teacher. Came to a meeting that that uh I was having in a city called Novasad. And uh he came there and came to the knowledge of the message and just was uh from that moment on he just gave his life, dedicated it to it. And they moved down into Croatia. He was teaching there and he was translating the message. And I've told this here before, but I was I always had a contention with brother Milo because he'd read the he'd read the messages in in the servo creation language and oh, he said, "It's just so wonderful." And I said, "But but he doesn't speak English. He doesn't speak any English." Oh, you know what? What message is that? So, he'd say, "Well, this is this message." And he said, "No, I'm telling you, it's perfect. Absolutely perfect." Well, with brother Mila, most things are perfect. And uh so I said how can it be perfect? I mean you know and he said it is it is absolutely perfect. So um uh brother Jonathan now has you know he has a very good grasp of the English language and he's just picked up right where his father left off because his father as you know has passed away passed away young and uh it was very heavy on our heart but it's a large family maybe six or seven children and young ladies and I wish you could see them if they were to stand on the platform today they are the personification of this message just absolutely beautiful family and that wife she continued to raise them they lived on meager fair uh lived on just whatever they had they don't have the social network that we have over here in the western countries and uh they they managed we sent them some help from here from time to time and the young people became educated you know and Jonathan he continued to study And now God brought this young woman, Anna. Uh, and they don't have a congregation to speak of, but they have meetings. And he's just carried on his father's in his father's footsteps. And he's just a he's just a dead ringer for him. He He's about the same size and looks exactly the same. He's doing exactly the same work. And it's just like God took one off the earth and put another one right there. You can't hardly tell any difference. And now he's gotten married and carrying on. Well, I'm happy that they got married and that we were able to send greetings to them. But I'm especially happy that he's carrying on the work. Amen. And that's so beautiful. It's just so wonderful. But they feel a they feel a connection much greater connection with us perhaps than you as individuals can feel with them because you don't know them as as as well as uh I do for example. But I just take it from me. they feel very very connected to you and they look in the streaming and see the faces and who's here and and they and when somebody's name is mentioned they remember that right away you know so I I'd like to give you greetings. We have an another wonderful email which I received from brother Ernie Villan Noea. He went to have meetings with brother Elijah Gibbs but he left a few days early and he wanted to go and see uh his his family. Uh you know here in the church we've been praying for his mother who had cancer in her lung and was up for an operation. Had a critical operation just a few days ago. uh she came through the operation uh successfully. Surgeon said the operation was successful. But brother Ernie has been burdened for his family for so many years because they were really really uh devoted Catholic people and yet the church you know it just couldn't do anything for them. uh they were just loyal people to the to that faith and uh brother Ernie uh experiencing the reality that he's had and the joy that he's had and you've all witnessed that he just somehow has been so desirous to convey that to them. But when they saw him, they said, "Well, you know, you were into this and you were into that." And well, anyone who's searching is into this and into that usually. And so he passed from one thing to another. And they said, "Well, you know, you were in the ptl club and then you're in the UPC and now you're in this." And so, uh, but when he went this time and and and and this you have to remember his mother's beyond the critical stage now. She's out and she's, you know, when a person has come to their crisis and come out of it, often they don't feel a need of God. See, so she passed that point, but he asked the family and those that were there if they would just leave. He wanted to be alone with his mother. And uh so he went with a special mission and he asked her, he said, "Mom, I would like to know if you would like to receive the Lord Jesus Christ and be saved." And she said, there wasn't even an instant of hesitation. She just said yes. And he said, "We had a most wonderful time of prayer." He said, "She cried. I cried. And I I I want the congregation to rejoice over that, too. That's that's a big a big load on brother Ernie's heart that has been lifted because he's been desiring this for years and now here it it had happened. So we we thank the Lord for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it wonderful &gt;&gt; if you were in that place? So the Bible says we rejoice with them that rejoice. Amen. And we rejoice over that. Uh, we want to be I'd like you to also if you would do something for me. My wife has been burdened for years for her brother. Bob Harper is his name. And uh, my wife and Linda went up and actually stayed in his home. His wife now is in a senior citizen's home. So, he's living alone. He got the flu. He wasn't well. He was not eating. And uh yet he's got a very very alert mind and he's actually quite physically fit. So they spent several days and just stayed right in his home there with him. Uh cooked and he oh he just like came back to life. But she's uh burdened. My wife is burdened and has been for years for his soul. And of all the family, he's the only one that hasn't been baptized. And she just holding fast to God. She wants to see him re receive Christ as his savior. They had some open doors. He was very open, very uh free to speak. Uh but it takes more than that. It takes a divine touch from almighty God. It takes the breath of God. It takes the light to strike the seed. And that's what we're praying for now. And if you would just take that upon your heart and pray with us for him. His name is Bob Harper. Well, God bless you. I wonder if we could just stand and perhaps we could just sing that chorus once again. Yeah. I'll bless his name. I bless your name. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] I bless your name. I bless your name. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer once again. Our lovely Lord Jesus, it is in your name that we come. We have gathered in your name and you have said in your word that all that we do we should do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We stand here with breath in our bodies father prepared and so desirous to bless your name to give you not only lip service but to give you service oh God with every energy that you give us. And now here Lord today I pray that you will cause each one to be their thoughts to be captivated by the Holy Spirit and may their thoughts be focused on eternal things. Help us not to be distracted Lord but help us to be just focused on what is your will Lord? What is your pleasure in this service? What would you have me to do Lord Jesus? And I'm here to do that. I pray, Father, that the Holy Spirit will have total preeminence and have control of every person as we as I stand here at the post of duty. I pray that you will cause my lips to utter the words that you'd have spoken, oh God. And may the minds of the people in their hearts comprehend, oh God, what the spirit speaketh to the church. I pray. We thank you for the message that you've sent. Thank you for the messenger that you've sent, Lord. Thank you, oh God. We have received a message that was without compromise. And I pray, oh God, that the truth will sink into our hearts and bear forth much fruit. In Jesus name, we wait upon your anointing now, oh God, for your glory. Amen. If you'd like to follow in your Bible and turn with me, please to Psalms uh 139, chapter 139, and we're going to read verses 14-1 17. scripture that's not unfamiliar to most of you 14-1 17 I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right Well, my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect, and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuence were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, oh God. How great is the sum of them. Isn't that wonderful? I'd like the whole congregation to join me on that last verse. Let's read it together. How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, oh God, how great is the sum of them. And the people said, "Amen." God bless you. You may have your seats. I want to take a fourth service, a fourth part of the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride and I'm that calls for such a such a broad subject. So, I I felt inspired the other night and I I want to just read what I just wrote down as I felt directed in just a moment. But I want to go back to how God uh put us together. How God in his creation when he created the first man and his wife, Adam and Eve, and that they were, if you have your thoughts now, he he structured them a certain way. He put them together in a certain fashion so that they would be redeemable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. and uh and we are put together in a body. We're bi biological creatures. We also have a spirit realm, an emotional realm, and we have a soul. So now you you just hold that because that's that needs to kind of overlay uh everything that I have to say today. And I have a lot of comments and a lot of scriptures and a lot of quotes. So you can keep your Bible handy if you would. Now, here's the notes just because this will give you a very, very clear overview where we're going. God in making his son and his wife made or formed them put them together so that redemption could take place. The woman, I would like you to notice this. the woman only only the woman could bring the fall. Yet Adam was responsible. Thus the scripture says by one man sin came into the world. But only a woman also the Virgin Mary could be used to bring forth the Savior. All the types and the shadows of the Old Testament were fulfilled in Jesus Christ. In other words, all the events in the Old Testament and the individuals spoke of pointed to him to Jesus Christ. They lived a small segment of his life. They were a cell of his body if I can put it in that language. His physical body came into being because the channel to the soul. Remember now I said they were constructed in such a way. They had to be given by God the creator a channel to the soul. So they his physical body that's the physical body of Jesus Christ came into being because the channel to the soul of a young virgin girl was open to the promised word and there was a performance of those things. When God made us or put us together, he made a body with senses to contact or physical. Number two, he made a spirit realm to experience life's happenings with a greater intensity compounding even the body senses. For example, we see which is a physical sense but also now we remember and that is in the spirit realm because our memory is one of the channels of the spirit. So we see something but now we remember it and we can recall it in our memory in our in our uh spirit realm and we may uh touch uh we may touch someone uh one of our loved ones. Parents touch their children. Husband and wife can touch hands and together and we experience affection and the affection compounds the touch. Are you following me? But the one channel to the soul is either unbelief or faith. That's the only thing that can be in that one channel. &gt;&gt; But God made it for faith. Faith cometh by hearing &gt;&gt; which is a sense of this physical body and hearing by the word of God. So someone now is energized and preaches being uh guided by the Holy Spirit and faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. And thus God sends his voice in its season. In every season, God has sent his voice. He sent his messengers. He sent his prophets. And he sent his prophet in this generation. He sends his prophet with his words in that prophet's mouth to speak words fitted for the channel to the soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. And those individuals in a certain season that have been birthed in a biological birth, a natural physical birth which came along through the a sexual relationship, a husband and wife and a child comes and we have a physical being a uh uh but then we are structured and put together so uniquely made As David had said, his his substance was not hid and he was fearfully and wonderfully made. And so God didn't just give us these physical senses and these other emotional senses or we call it the realm of the spirit, but he gave us also that one channel to the soul which has been fitted and designed to receive the word. That's why God gave us that channel to receive the word. And then the soul is converted and the converted soul then takes control of the realm of the spirit and then that it begins to control the memory and the imagination and the conscience and the reasoning and the affection begins to control it. A converted soul begins to control it. If the soul if that channel is filled only with unbelief then the word cannot come. The soul cannot be re be converted or born again. There's no birth takes place. And then uh the the senses of the uh the senses of the physical and the senses of this of the spirit are just go rampant. &gt;&gt; They're just under the control of the domain of this world, this present evil age. &gt;&gt; And then you see the world that we're living in. &gt;&gt; That's why it is the way that it is. But the spirit realm then comes into into subjection to a converted soul and the spirit realm then controls the physical realm and it throws the whole body subject to the word. &gt;&gt; If unbelief is in the channel, it throws the whole being out of cater and into sinful attributes. And that's why a prophet says all these things, all these attributes, all these things that people do, that's not the sin. The sin was there was unbelief in that channel. &gt;&gt; That was the sin. Well, now we can stand and go home. I finished my message, but now I'd like to Would you like to kind of see where we're going from here? That gave you a I'm sure a good clear picture. The Bible says this of of uh Joseph and Mary. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. That's to Joseph, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife. I want you to notice this next phrase, please. For that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. She perhaps was not even aware but that which is conceived in her in her is of the Holy Ghost. uh in the in the uh altar book for uh April 16th, April 18th, I'm sorry. Brother Brandham says you are filled with something. You might be filled with doubt. Your poor heart poor hearts may be running over with doubt. He said, "I hope not." Your hearts may be full of frets and worry. And it might be that your hearts are full of trouble. He says when he closed this, he said, "You can't remain empty. You're full of something." &gt;&gt; And the world is full of things. Everybody's heart is full of things. This is a this is an age of self-discovery. People are trying to discover themselves. I'm trying to find myself. Is Is that true? True. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; You know, this isn't coming as any surprise to you. And the reason for that is is because we've fallen from something. &gt;&gt; You're missing something. And the reason for that also secondly is that there is more. There's something within us that tells us there's more. There's more for you. There's more spiritually. There's the multitudes of people that don't profess anything spiritually, but they just know that they can attain more. The athlete knows he can do better. They can just attain something. they can achieve something higher. The intellectual wants to do more. The businessman wants to he knows he can do better. He can do more. Everybody, you know, they they have goals. And that's what goals are all about because goals are something that you haven't attained to yet. And we're going to get into that just a wee bit. But in this uh in this age of self-discovery, I thought I would just find what what some people have said about it. And one person has said, "It is only when we it is only when we silent the blaring sounds of our daily existence that we can finally hear the whispers of truth that life reveals to us as it stands knocking on the doorsteps of our hearts." In other words, we're seeking for something, but it's right close to us. Someone else has said, and this was Mark Twain, he said, 'I can teach anybody how to get what they want out of life. The problem is that I can't find anybody who can tell me what they want. And that's also very, very true. And someone else has said, and I thought this is really good. He said, God, why do I storm heaven for answers that are already in my heart? Every grace I need has already been given me. Oh, lead me to the beyond &gt;&gt; within. &gt;&gt; Lead me to the beyond that's within. &gt;&gt; If we could realize the prophet saying once the bride realizes who she is, &gt;&gt; what's hindering us? If we could realize who we are &gt;&gt; and what is within us, I can tell you it would be a formidable body of people. &gt;&gt; That was a weak amen, but it's true anyway. I'll say amen to it. &gt;&gt; It is a super church. &gt;&gt; It can only be a super church if she has a super possession. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so that which is conceived in her, I've been pondering this now for some weeks and I've been thinking about what it is that's within this bride, the body of Jesus Christ. What is it that we possess? Because I believe we possess so much more than uh than we perhaps realize. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to be clear on one thing. Although God made us so that we could be uh he didn't only make us to be redeemable but he made us also that we could participate in redemption &gt;&gt; as Mary participated in redemption. Now we cannot participate and this is what I want to be clear. We cannot participate and do not participate in the price of redemption. Jesus paid it all. You can add nothing to the price of your redemption. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's Christ and him alone. Christ plus nothing. &gt;&gt; Christ plus no uh no nothing that we can add ourselves. But we do have a part. The scripture says, "Neither by the blood of goats or ca and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us &gt;&gt; and that's it." &gt;&gt; As they say in French, to me, that's the end. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Do it for me. &gt;&gt; I know it's right, but I like to ask the experts. However, although Christ paid it all, then the Bible says also, "Go ye and preach the gospel." Why? Because in preaching the gospel, somebody's going to hear the good news, and they're going to give their life to Christ, and they're going to enter into redemption because we have a part. You may not ever preach a message. You may never stand behind a pulpit, but you have an integral part in the plan of redemption as God has called you to be an expression of Jesus Christ in this world. So, he didn't only make you to be redeemable, but he made you so that you could be a participant in the plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says, "He hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on the face of the earth." He made He made all men of one blood. We're here of many many races here. We may be different uh colors and all the rest of it, but biologically we're made of one blood. &gt;&gt; We can give each other a blood transfusion, be just fine. &gt;&gt; We are all humans. Brother Brandham says we're all human beings. We all came from God. God by one blood made all nations. So biologically speaking, as far as humanity is concerned, we're all the same. Uh at that biologically, we're essentially the same. However, in nature and in character, we're very different. &gt;&gt; You find one, you know, real boisterous and brother Brandon says blusterous. And then you find the next one and he's dogmatic. Then you find the next one, he's really quiet. You find one who's a extrovert, the next one's an introvert. So within that spirit realm, we we we're very different. &gt;&gt; And we might say, well, it came on down, you know, to our families or whatever more, however it was put together. That may be fine. But God also knew that's exactly how you were going to come. And he never intended that a person who's an introvert or a person who's an extrovert or a person who's dogmatic or a person who's blisterous or next who's so withdrawn, he never intended that that character or nature should hinder our spiritual walk with God. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said he made you in a variety. Some men are real blusterous and some are real dogmatic and others are fine and others are kind. And you just find all different kinds of people in the kingdom. &gt;&gt; You find some people they're they're poppers because they can't they can't save anything. They just give it some people and some people just spend it on themselves. &gt;&gt; And next person they can &gt;&gt; Well, you want to hear it? I heard it a long time ago. They can squeeze a penny till the American Eagle looks like a sand hill crane. Just can't get anything out of them. Well, we'll leave that where it is. Brother Bram says in the questions and answers on the seals, he said Jesus came to be a witness as a savior to the world. And the great scholars that should have known him said, "This man is Bub." He said, "We'll not have this man to rule over us and so forth. We'll not do it." But a little prostitute with a life in her, &gt;&gt; something in her that they didn't have in them. And God did that from the foundation of the world. He structured her and put her together that way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So she had something in her predestinated to eternal life and her name is immortally in the word of God here. &gt;&gt; And he said she walked up there and the first time the light struck that little seed quickly she knew it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message the mighty God unveiled, he says, "Now God might have had to interbreed this and that to get a certain ting of the bell &gt;&gt; like the moulder." But he said, "But when Jesus turned and said, speaking to her, I am he that speaks with you," there was no such an expression as bleub. Right? &gt;&gt; See, so now they had great intellectual men, theologians, students of the word of God, but they had something different in them. &gt;&gt; It was in them. &gt;&gt; It wasn't just a It didn't just come right that moment. They had something actually in them. &gt;&gt; One place it says they were filled with envy. &gt;&gt; They were filled with, you know, they were filled with anger. They were filled with it. It was in them. &gt;&gt; They had that. But she had something else in her. And when he said, "I am he that speaks to thee." He said, "She left her water pot, ran into the city, and said, Come and see a man who told me all things that I have done. Isn't this the very Messiah?" He said, "Now, what did this?" That's the question. What did this? What caused that to happen? I just thought I would bring this home. Why are you here? &gt;&gt; What did this? What brought you to this service? What kind of hunger? We had prayer in the in the uh uh in minister study and and in prayer I just felt you know the people have come here. I I I I just I almost get uh I I get a little bit fearful. I see the cars lined up on both sides of the street in the parking lot packed and I said, "Oh God, the people have come here hungry and the people have come here with anticipation and expectation. I pray no man can satisfy that. Only God. because you have something in you. Craving for something far beyond words or something that's put together or something intellectual. It's way beyond that. Only God can satisfy that thirst. &gt;&gt; He said, "What what did this of putting the old putting the old scripture with the experience?" Notice how he worded that so perfect. Putting the Old Testament and the old scripture with the experience, uniting them together at that moment. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said that Jesus was giving to her. He said what did it? It made the Messiah. That's what that's how come she could come to that conclusion cuz she was putting he was putting all the scriptures and the things and and the experience together. And he said quickly notice now please. And he says, "What?" And did you notice quickly her sins were forgiven because at the beginning she was redeemable. &gt;&gt; God made her redeemable. &gt;&gt; Life's experience was a misery. Her emotional life, her biological life, her physical being was a disaster. Her emotional life was a total upheaval. But because she recognized the scripture that had come with the event, that was the Messiah to her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That was the Messiah. And on that recognition, she was forgiven. &gt;&gt; Because she was redeemable. God gave her that capacity at the beginning. And we cannot ask him why did you do it? Why didn't you do it to the priest? Why did you do it to her? That's God's business. That's God's choosing. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Quickly her sins were forgiven because she was redeemable. Because she was in God's thinking at the beginning. So it so it redeemed her or brought her back when when she seen the expressed scripture manifested of Jehovah, what he was, what he is. Very early this morning, in the wee hours of the morning actually, I was listening to God identified by his own characteristics. And I tell you friends, this message is so perfect. You know, the world is going to have to give an answer that they've got libraries and they've got books and they've got all this stuff and all this trash that they just read and gobble up and all these movies and all these industries and all these DVDs and all of this nonsense and they just gobble up. Don't tell me they haven't got time. and they got all kinds of time and playing around and fooling around on computers and seeing this and listening to that music and all the rest of it. And God sits here &gt;&gt; with hundreds and hundreds of hours of his voice. &gt;&gt; They called 25 people. He just called, he says, "Okay, let's just start at let's just start at 75 and bring them up to a hundred and just have them come up here." And the first man that came there, uh, he just said to the man something on this order. He said, "Well, you're you're seriously sick. You're you're you're in serious condition." And he said, "Are we strangers?" I I just try to comprehend that. Here we are. We're strangers. And I asked myself, you know, why is God doing this? No human can do it. Why is God doing it? And he said to the man, "You got you have prostate cancer and they've operated, but they couldn't get it and it's gone through your whole body." He said, "And that's all he said to him. He just said, "Is is that the truth?" He said, 'Well, the God something like the God I serve, the God that is present here, that devil could hide from the surgeon's knife, but he can't hide from God. &gt;&gt; When I hear something like that, I just say, God &gt;&gt; only speaking the truth. &gt;&gt; And if you can do that for the physical, biological body of an individual, what can you do for a man's soul? What can you do for his character? We may be here and I don't think I don't think we should make any excuse for our character. &gt;&gt; We been born this way where we maybe we are a certain way but I know a God can change that. &gt;&gt; I know a God who's greater than the genes that came down from your father and your mother than the chromosones or whatever more. I know a God that's greater than that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I think every person experiences uh some of the awe that I sense in David's words when he said that he was curiously and wonderfully made, fearfully and wonderfully made. And that his substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret. and you did see my substance yet imperfect and in thy book all my members were written which are which which in continuence were fashioned when as yet there was none of them. It it seems that David is gripped with a almost an awe as to his uh physical being. And it is we can't we can't we just dedicated a baby. You know, there's doctors say you can see pictures of them being formed. I It's just too It's just too absolutely too astounding for me. I've seen the the the the secret of life or the mystery of life. Some, you know, documentary that was put together. It was just how how two individuals just a man and a woman in in in the union that God allowed and can bring forth that kind of a life with all the circulation system and all of that to me that is just too wonderful. &gt;&gt; And if God did that just so we can live here for a few years, &gt;&gt; what about the soul? &gt;&gt; What about how he's put us together? How did he how did he put us together? And we need to give the attention. We give a lot of attention to the body. We need to give attention to our soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. God. And it's not just because it's because it's something we maybe can't really define. It doesn't mean that it's some kind of nebulous thing down in there. And you know, uh, God actually constructed that. How glorious it is. I thank God. I'm so glad you gave a channel to my soul. So glad I had an opportunity to hear something with my ear and have my spirit realm, have my spirit touched and the thirst that is within my soul desire that &gt;&gt; and that desire has never left. &gt;&gt; It never has to leave. &gt;&gt; You even had it when you're in the world, &gt;&gt; didn't you not? &gt;&gt; You're searching for something, searching for reality, searching for truth, searching for purity. you'll never find it in the world. &gt;&gt; So, we've been uh structured in such a way. I think I could say honestly that our bodies is a marvel of supernatural ingenuity. We can never fully comprehend this handy work of God. The Bible speaks of this that as I referred to a few moments ago that we are uh we have things that we could attain to. And the Bible says this. I'm going to give you some scriptures quickly. And hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Brother Brandham refers to that many times. The apostle Paul has written that to the Ephesians which is our inheritance book. You know, it speaks of heavenly places in Christ Jesus. It it's not talking about the the, you know, living in the dregs or living in despondency. It's talking about an elevated place. &gt;&gt; And so, naturally, we have a we have a desire and a hunger for those things &gt;&gt; because it's there for us. You may not be soaring in heavenly places, but be it known to you, if you are a born again son or daughter of God, God has given you the capacity. It's not out there someplace. And you don't have to go searching for, you know, your your uh your inner being. You don't have to search elsewhere. It's within you. &gt;&gt; The capacity is there within you. &gt;&gt; All you have to do is say, "God, take a hold of this that you put in me. You've already put me together this way. I've been ordained for this. I've been designed for this. You had this in your mind from the beginning. Why do we want to miss it? &gt;&gt; The Apostle Paul. And in spite of this depths of the spiritual understanding that the Apostle Paul had in his life, yet we have him saying this thing. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth for those things that are before. So, he's saying, I haven't got it all. I haven't attained it all. And I think we could all, you know, raise our hands and say, that's me. I haven't attained it all. I I'm well aware of that. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't count myself to apprehended. But the one thing that Apostle Paul did, I trust that you are doing reaching &gt;&gt; forth &gt;&gt; to those things which are before. Not just reaching forth, you know, in kind of lost and, you know, groping in some foggy area. Not that. No. And not just going along in our Christian life kind of a, you know, if it comes fine. If it doesn't come, well, fine. No, it's not that. his focus. There's something before me. I've been apprehended and the God that apprehended me has a purpose and I'm reaching forth to that purpose. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he desired to do more. In one one of his last services, he told about going beyond the curtain of time. And we hear that all the time. But he said prior to that experience, he woke up early sitting in bed. I was with him. He described it. He said he put his hands behind his head like that, leaned against the headboard. He said, "Well, Bill Brham, you're 52 years old. If you're going to do something for God, you better get going." and he had that craving &gt;&gt; to do more. &gt;&gt; You know, that's hard for me to understand. &gt;&gt; But here's a man, you know, stand before hundreds of thousands of people and see what he saw and witness what he witnessed and the miracles and all the rest of it. It's just incredible. And yet he has that within him. So what am I saying? I'm saying it's a principle of spiritual life that there's something before us and we and and we need to feel not only that there's something before us but that we're reaching for it and and it's it's attainable. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The Bible says of us, I'm going rather slowly, but I want to really really establish this. The Bible says of us that we grown to be clothed upon of our body. We've grown to be clothed upon. Here it is. For we know that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves grown within ourselves, waiting for the adoption to whip the redemption of our body because redemption's process isn't completed yet. There's a redemption of our body. &gt;&gt; And so, we grown. &gt;&gt; We desire. I know that you do. &gt;&gt; I know that you have it. We all desire. We we we're just made that way. That's the way we're made. Emotionally, we're made that way. Physically, I trust that we're made that way. Then the Bible says also Paul in 2 Corinthians, for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle, we're dissolved, we have a building of God and house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this, for in this we grown earnestly, desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven. But do you know that the most of people within this whole area and where you live, they don't even give that a second thought. &gt;&gt; That sounds like, you know, hookie spooks to them. &gt;&gt; Another body eternal in the heavens, a theophony. you start talking about a theophony that's right beside you and all all that's language you fully understand and and we're consumed with the change of this body. We're consumed with the resurrection. We're consumed with the the a millennium and and being able to enter into a another realm, another dimension. That's all language that's it's foreign language to people. &gt;&gt; Okay. I ask you, why do you have it? Why do you have that in you? &gt;&gt; And if it is a reality in you, where did it come from? &gt;&gt; Have you just been brainwashed? &gt;&gt; Is it just No. You know, this is the one thing that the world doesn't understand because they many many people look upon the message, especially within the religious world, they look upon the message as some kind of, you know, uh uh brainwashing process. No, I'll I'll put it to you this way that when you heard the gospel of truth, when you heard this message, there was already something here that matched with it. &gt;&gt; It just came together. &gt;&gt; And the thing was the message didn't come first. &gt;&gt; What was inside came first. &gt;&gt; What was inside was before the foundation of the world. What came first in John's gospel the 4th chapter? It wasn't it wasn't Jesus coming to the well. &gt;&gt; He came to the well because it was already in the woman. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was already in her. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before you heard the message, the message came but you already had it in you. And that's why the message made sense to you. &gt;&gt; Even though your life may have been completely contrary. and their conditions and your environment and your situation was totally contrary. And maybe when you first heard it, you said, you know, how can I believe that? How can I, you know, I'm so involved. I'm so tied to this religion or this church or this colony or this whatever. &gt;&gt; How can I ever how can I break away of this? But in your heart, in your soul, and you didn't even you couldn't even put it together. You weren't trying to figure out how am I structured. All you do is my soul, something inside, it's already there is saying, "Yay, amen. This is truth. &gt;&gt; This is what I've been waiting for." It doesn't matter if it's a derelch on the street, the prostitute on the street, or the most eloquent minister of the uh of some church or religion, or anything in between that &gt;&gt; that entire distance, there's some that have been structured in such a way, &gt;&gt; they already possess it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I can say that in them, they're full of desire. &gt;&gt; They're full. They crave. They yearn. They groan. They already have it. &gt;&gt; And then comes the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ in its season. They say, "That's for me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why one person can obtain it. I think of the two young men that were in the army in Singapore. And I met to one of them and he just, you know, he had no ambition, no desire for God. He's not thinking about God. And the other fellow is being witnessed to by a believer. And they're going to show uh uh deep calls to the deep. And so this believer was he just onto his buddy, this friend of his saying, "I want you to come and see this film. I want you to come and see it." He doesn't want to go alone. He's afraid that they're going to zero in on him and button hole him. and he's afraid of that. So he goes to another buddy says, you know, uh, they're pressing me to come and see this film. Would you come and just keep me company? Yeah, sure. Fine. I'll go with you. So he goes and he's the one that gets it. &gt;&gt; He just he said, "Hey, this is it. Is it?" And he's the believer that I talked to. He said, "That's how I came. I wasn't looking for it. He was looking for me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? So we had the groaning long before we even heard of it in the message the breach. He said now now we say this. We say sin. He said we just call it sin. Break it down. What is sin? A lot of people say drinking, committing adultery. No. No. He said that's the attributes of sin. He said that's what sin causes. But real sin is unbelief. And I really need to zero. You've heard that many, many times. But in the context of the service this morning, real sin is unbelief. He said, "And if you're a believer, you don't do those things. But no matter how holy you try to make yourself or how religious you try to be, if you do those things, you're an unbeliever." &gt;&gt; Now, he says, "Now, something lost, something that's lost, and it's groaning. It's trying to get back. The reason why we grown, a lot of people don't groan. They're not expecting anything. I've had people, you know, my time's up. I'm happy to go. And they're not thinking, they don't even spend that much time thinking about that they may face God, that there's something on the other side, that they're just going to take a step. They have no consciousness of that at all. There's no groaning. They're not anticipating anything. And a lot of people, a lot multitudes, untold millions just totally deluded believe yet, you know, because a preacher is going to come and speak a nice funeral service that somehow that'll just put them in heaven. Not a chance. &gt;&gt; He said something's groaning and it's trying to get back &gt;&gt; to be back to its original condition. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember one time here, Brother Tom preached and he really dwelt on this subject. They're not in their ought to be condition. &gt;&gt; And that's why they grown. That's why you yearn. And no matter where you were, you had that because you were not in your ought to be condition. Now when God made man, body with senses to contact the world we live in, a spirit with senses that amplify the things of the body. Now I I just I'd like to dwell on that a wee bit. We have our our our our physical. We see and we hear and we smell and we uh what good would it be, you know, if we just could see something? But we we see something and uh those of you that are married, one day you saw the young lady or the young lady saw the young man and and you saw someone and it set up something inside in the realm of the affections. Then brother Brandham talks about, you know, felio love and ag. And that filio love, you know, that would maybe make one man kill another man or injure him because of something that he was doing to his family or his wife or whatever more. But a goppel love would cause him to pray for his soul. Totally different. &gt;&gt; Depends what's in a person. And we all have felia love. We all have that. And I trust we all have ag. So when God made man, he assembled him in such a way so he could contact the physical creation but also gave him a channel to contact God. So now I I just want to talk about the touch. Now, and I I I I haven't got time to read all of these things, but it was in a quote, the unpardonable sin. And brother Brandham describes in the Old Testament how a man would bring his lamb for a sin offering and then he would put his hand on the head and you can read it. Put his hand on the head of the lamb. Now, so his physical biological body is feeling that head of that lamb under him. Then and then the priest maybe takes a sharp rock or whatever more and begins to cut that juggler and he hears it, you know, be bleeding and bleeding and he and he sees and he feels under his hand. So, he's got his sight and he's got his hearing and he's got his feeling and he sees the blood spattering out of that animal and he feels it quivering under his hand and he knows that should be me. &gt;&gt; And it's registering into his into his spirit realm. &gt;&gt; Not just physically, but into his spirit realm. He feels it. He sees it. He may smell the animal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he knows it's dying for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it had to be a certain kind of a lamb. Maybe something he raised and something that was close to him. And now he's being separated from it because of his because of his sin. And he experiences all of that by his touch and by his sight and by his feeling. But there was no salvation. &gt;&gt; He went out the same sinner he was when he came in. &gt;&gt; See what I mean? Because in the Old Testament that channel that channel was not made perfect under the law. So they could do all kinds of activity but it didn't change the blood of bulls and goats could not change that soul realm. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "But once a man put his hands," He said, "but once a man put his hands." He says, "Oh my, a man put his hands on the head of Jesus Christ." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now here today, &gt;&gt; not this hand, &gt;&gt; not the feeling of this body, but God has given you the ability to lace place your hand by faith on the head of Jesus Christ. Say, "Well, I can't see it and I can't feel it." That's not the point. That's that's what the prophet has said. Can you say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be distracted. There's quite a bit of movement. I'd like as little movement as possible, please. In living and dying, buried and rising, said in the Old Testament, they brought a lamb. Oh, listen. No, I'm sorry. I wanted to read the rest of this. He puts his hands on the head of Jesus Christ and confess his sin, feeling the pains and the agony of Calvary. He said, uh, he said what he had to pay to redeem a man from sin. And the Holy Spirit out of the blood of Jesus Christ comes cleansing the man. It's not within your touch. It's not within your hearing or your sight. But it is your faith. And God has given the channel to the soul. Faith, &gt;&gt; the ability to have faith and to confess with the mouth. You don't have to feel it, but you need to confess with your mouth. I believe that. &gt;&gt; I believe what the scripture has said. If I confess with my mouth and believe in my heart on the Lord Jesus Christ, I shall be saved. &gt;&gt; And it's not just for salvation, friends, because we need that channel open all the time. &gt;&gt; I'm going to get into some deeper things. I want you to really hang on here. Just please. &gt;&gt; He said he and the Holy Spirit out of the blood of Jesus Christ comes cleansing the man. He goes out a new creature &gt;&gt; and it's once for all. What a powerful thing. &gt;&gt; What a powerful thing. A man is changed. He doesn't feel anything. He doesn't become emotionally involved. It it it's his his memory. I mean, I deal with people sometimes and their memory is so clogged with all the things and the negative things that have happened and the disappointments that have happened and life and all the we call it baggage. The the Bible hasn't got a term for that. It's not calling it baggage, but it's the things Paul says, we're forgetting those things. Why? Getting rid of those things which are behind and reaching out to the things which are ahead. What things? Not to just better times or a raise or or or you know, a more secure future. That's not it. He's reaching out for the spiritual things. Reaching out what faith can lay hold of. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If I if I was sitting in this service today and didn't know that I was redeemed, I'd say, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; just give me the inner sight today and give me the inner fortitude to reach out my hand by faith and lay it on the head of Jesus Christ." I'd close my eyes and I would see my hand going onto the head of Jesus Christ. I'd want to feel that quivering body paying for my sin. I'd want the blood to to to to be sprinkled over me. And I'd see my soul being washed. And I would see the stripes on his back if I were a sick person and lay my head upon him. And I'd say, "Jesus, paid it all. &gt;&gt; I hear the voice, not in these ears, but in my soul, I hear the voice crying out, "It is finished. &gt;&gt; It is finished." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have inner inner &gt;&gt; inner facility, inner capacity &gt;&gt; to hear that. &gt;&gt; If I was here today and my soul was kind of dry and I haven't I haven't had uh what I would call a insight and a revelation. I didn't have stimulation. I'd say, "God, you had a messenger come and deliver a message and said I could be stimulated by revelation. And I lay my hand upon that word. I lay my hand upon that Christ. And I claim that for myself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't intend to go out these doors until I have that kind of stimulation. &gt;&gt; This will be a different kind of a service. &gt;&gt; It belongs to me. &gt;&gt; Do you want to continue in the doldrums? Do you want to continue in a negative position? Do you want to stay there? Or do you want to say no? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. G &gt;&gt; maybe life has not dealt you life has not dealt anybody an easy a easy easy way. &gt;&gt; He says now by faith lay your hands on the head of Jesus Christ and feel that suffering that forsaking until blood and water separated. feel the suffering and say, "Lord God, upon the basis of this, I now come as a sinner, be merciful to me." &gt;&gt; What's he saying? He's saying that because that works. &gt;&gt; Somebody here needs to say that. &gt;&gt; I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to say it and walk out of this place a different person. I feel that suffering. I feel that quivering. I hear &gt;&gt; him saying and calling out and crying out. I hear it all. I mean, I by faith, I'm reaching back. Isn't it just a Isn't it amazing? You can reach back in an instant. 2,000 years. There is no time with God. There is no time with God. It's the same as Calvar's right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Christ died before the foundation of the world and he paid for your sin right now. He paid for your healing right now. And I prayed before this service, lo God, I want to see the supernatural take place at the preaching of the word because I believe I'm coming to a place of people that are that have a they have a channel, one channel that God gave them when he structured them before the foundation of the world. These people have that channel. Help me, oh God, to be give them the utterance so that word will reach that channel. And if you got that channel full of all the all the doctors and all the everything that the doctor has said, you got to get it out. &gt;&gt; You got to say this is what the word of God says. &gt;&gt; If you got that channel stuffed full of all the all the hurts that you've had and all the reverses you've had and all the disappointments you've had and all the things that you've suffered, you got to blow it out. &gt;&gt; There's no way the Holy Spirit's trying to poke the word down there. The prophet said that flu, that flu of that memory needs to be blown clear. &gt;&gt; You might have to say, "Somebody wronged me." But I forgive them. &gt;&gt; I forgive them. I blow that thing clear, oh God, by the Holy Spirit. And now I believe your word. &gt;&gt; I believe what's being preached. &gt;&gt; I believe you intend me to leave this place a different man, a different woman. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon wasn't saying that to get people excited. He was saying that because it's truth. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says I'm I'm on just on the touch yet. And the Bible says, "Now when the sun was setting, and all that had any sick with diverse diseases brought them unto him, and he laid his hands on them, every one of them, and healed them." Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, it would be wonderful if today &gt;&gt; I'm not even a I'm not even to be regarded as a poor substitute. I I'm poorer than that. But they brought their sick and their afflicted. They brought their babies and their young ones. And he laid his hands on them and he touched them. and healed everyone. How beautiful. &gt;&gt; And that is Jesus Christ yesterday and that's Jesus Christ today. &gt;&gt; And the capacity. You have the capacity. &gt;&gt; I'm not just pumping you up. I'm telling you, you have the capacity. God gave you the capacity to reach out and touch him. &gt;&gt; The woman, she reached through. She she she made her way through the legs of whatever of the people and got through so she could touch the hem of his garment. &gt;&gt; And what did he say? Who touched me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you still have that capacity. You have that today. You can touch him and receive what you need to receive from him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He'll be moved. &gt;&gt; Not just talking about physical things, talking about spiritual things. Oh God, &gt;&gt; sometime I hear people with their problems and the things and and then I ask them, "What have you been listening to during the services? What have you been hearing?" I hear the cry and the call of the Holy Spirit calling you people to a higher life in Christ. &gt;&gt; Don't sit there and be satisfied with crumbs when God is handing you a seven course meal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How rich this message is. &gt;&gt; How rich it is. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Apostle John said, "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, &gt;&gt; which we have seen, &gt;&gt; and which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life." &gt;&gt; Many people touched him, got nothing. Multitudes heard him, never got a thing. Many people were a touch and many people received something from him but didn't get eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Mark's gospel said, "And as they did eat, they tasted." Jesus did took the bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to them and said, "Take, eat. This is my body." How many today are taking of the body of Christ or are told they are but they don't get anything. The prophet says also so when he breathed into this man he said I don't know how he made him but he put him in five senses so he could contact his earthly home and see and taste and feel and smell and hear and he made him in that manner. Now, those senses were not made to contact God. &gt;&gt; And the five senses of the spirit, for those of you that I've said this many times, and for especially those of you that are new and maybe those that are young, I remember them easily by uh more easily by association. So, I just have it my car. My car. M I C A R memory, imagination, conscience, affection, and reasoning. My car hasn't gotten me very far, but that car won't get you very far either. &gt;&gt; Depends what's in your memory and what's in your imagination and what's in your reasoning and what's in your affection. depends on what's in that. Now, okay, we're really coming home now. We've heard I've heard services. I've heard brother John. I've heard brother Lance. I've been listening very close. Brother Tom listen these various brothers ministering. And there's much said about the emotions and emotions. Well, I'm trying to break that down now. It's not just the emotions that that is that realm, but God God gave it to you when he structured you. I I hope you it it's terrible to be around somebody that completely loses their memory. &gt;&gt; I've talked to people just recently whose loved ones have dementia. My granddaughter Sharon works with people with that all the time. A very sad situation out where my mother-in-law was a man. I believe he had been a doctor and he was just in his 50s and he completely lost it. Big, strong, healthy man, more like brother DJ. Walk up and down the aisles of that senior citizen's home. He wasn't a senior citizen. strong as an ox and just back and forth pace back and forth and completely out of touch with the world. His mind was completely gone. Nobody even knew what happened, what tipped him over the edge. God gave you a mind. God gave you a memory. &gt;&gt; God gave you a place for affection. God gave you a place to consider and weigh things out. &gt;&gt; But if we allow Satan to get in there and use them, &gt;&gt; and as believers, I'm sad to say, but it happens on a regular basis. We let Satan get in there and start to torment us. And so constantly, not constantly, but as a as a result, we get filled. And I'm talking to this congregation. I don't have to go any place. We get filled with fear. We get filled with questions. We get filled with anxiety. We get filled with bitterness and begins to consume us. We get filled with maybe envy and we see the world being blessed or we see someone else being blessed and we do a comparison with us and them and then we we get filled with disappointment. We just get filled with a whole array of things and it begins to consume our whole spirit realm. &gt;&gt; And then it begins to control our physical realm. &gt;&gt; We have trouble maybe being a real brother or a sister to somebody because we're holding a hurt. we're holding some misunderstanding and we just can't give them that kind of handshake that should be. And so it it begins to restrict and hinder brotherly love. &gt;&gt; We get filled with those things. &gt;&gt; We can get filled with anger and it's just below just below the surface. And you know, you don't even have to be angry at anybody, but it's just an anger that's there. You know, it's it's uh I think I get that way sometimes. Just, you know, you become irritable. Of course, you people don't do that, but it does happen. We get irritable because things aren't going right. and our whole emotional thing. And if you think that you're going to get through life without these kind of I'm not talking about just superficial things. I'm talking about things that are so deep that you can't even talk openly to your loved one about it. It's just real real deep. Maybe you have questions and the questions are so deep you'd say, "Oh, I'd never ask brother Ed about that. I'd just be I'd be horrified to have him even think I have that kind of a question." &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; I'd never ask my wife that. I would never want her to even think I'd never want her to even know that that's passing through my mind that I have that kind of a question. Why am I getting down where we actually live? Why am I getting there? Is because if we allow those things to occupy those channels of the spirit, it's a playground for the devil. &gt;&gt; And it only goes from there downhill. Then you find yourself, your joy is gone, your victory is gone, and you're just down and you're depressed &gt;&gt; and discouraged. More than discouraged, you're just down, depressed, and you just wonder what's life all about? Is it worth living? Well, can I take a few more minutes? Amen. &gt;&gt; That is those channels of the spirit. And I'm so thankful for the message that really you want to read. If you want to know, go and get and read and listen to the deep the greatest battle ever fought. &gt;&gt; That's a message for the 21st century. &gt;&gt; Imagination channel, the conscience channel. And the Bible says this, "And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, and that was when they brought the woman caught in the very act of adultery, and said, Moses said to stone her, what sayest thou?" And then when Jesus gave the answer, "He that's without sin, cast the first stone." The Bible says that they were convicted by their own conscience. They were convicted by their own conscience. Listen to me now. I'm not over. &gt;&gt; And they went out. None of them born again. &gt;&gt; So they were convicted in their conscience but did not get eternal life. &gt;&gt; Doesn't happen in that realm. &gt;&gt; People say, "Oh, I felt, oh, I felt so good." Doesn't mean a thing. If you see me just dead pan when people say that, "Oh, it just, oh, I just felt the spirit." Well, come and tell me about five years from now. &gt;&gt; I want to see what the spirit did for you in the next year. &gt;&gt; I want to see that stable walk. &gt;&gt; Brother Ed, I don't really feel much of anything, but here I am. &gt;&gt; And here I stand. and I'm here this year and I'll be here next year and I'll be here the following year and I'll be here to the rapture and I'll greet you on the other side. &gt;&gt; That's when something struck the soul &gt;&gt; and it's a reality. &gt;&gt; We've experienced it. &gt;&gt; How many have experienced it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is a place to praise God. God made you that way. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; The reasoning and the Bible says, "And it came to pass that while they communed together, two believers, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and went with them." They still didn't have any revelation. They just were communing and reasoning together about all the events. Oh, what's going to happen? Uh, you know, how's the body going to be changed? And and when's the big earthquake going to take place? And the Pope's visiting right now. I tell you what, I felt sorry for the state of New York &gt;&gt; when he blessed ground zero. &gt;&gt; That guarantees it always stayed ground zero. The Bible says that whatever he blesses is cursed. &gt;&gt; I just pray, you know, it's it's it's sorry, but you know, they arrive at the airport and the first thing to do is come down and don't kiss that tarmac. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? I've never got a very great benefit out of that. Now I probably have to go to to a fifth portion because these are things that are very very deep on me and I have to describe them to you. Now brother Brandham has people uh uh untold thousands of people that have come before him and you can you can search it out yourself and he says this I'm trying to contact your spirit. I'm trying to contact your spirit. I never found once where he says, "I'm trying to contact your soul. I'm trying to contact your spirit." Because that was God's avenue to get to the soul. &gt;&gt; And so he'd have to startle them and say, "All right, you had an operation like he said to the man." He said to a woman, one of the third or fourth woman to come up. He said now you have a what's troubling you is you have a birthark. Try to put this one together. You have a birthark and you think it's turned cancerous. And the woman just goes a tell me he hit a cord &gt;&gt; and he says all this is is to try to help you to &gt;&gt; say it again. &gt;&gt; Believe. try to help you to clear out the one channel &gt;&gt; to get this worry out of the way to get this fretting out of the way. How many times it says you're so nervous? Oh, you're so nervous. Hundreds of times. Hundreds of times people are nervous because they're ftting. They're anxious. They're worried. They're concerned. They got doubts. They got questions. Got to get that out of the way so they can believe. And if I tell you something, then you can believe. the channel got clear and they believed and they could receive what they wanted from God. &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, if that channel ever has to be clear, it's got to be clear for a group of people that expect the resurrection. &gt;&gt; It's got to be clear for people that expect the rapture. &gt;&gt; The rapture is not coming to the emotions. The rapture is not coming to the affection. It's not coming to the memory of the imagination or the reasoning. It's coming to the soul. the soul that's redeemed. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then when the soul is changed, that which has happened in the soul rises up and takes control. That's a control tower. Takes control of your affections. Affections can go haywire. Affections can go sideways. Takes control of the affections. You that are unmarried, you need the soul controlling your affections because you're very vulnerable to become attracted to someone who's not your husband or not your wife. And the one that God said, "Well, how can I be sure?" be dictated to by the soul. &gt;&gt; If you follow the affections, if you just follow the emotional realm. So here we are. And now we have the sight. Oh, it's fine looking young man. See the way he stands. You see the way his features. you see this or see her or see this or something. I just saw that. You know, I don't know, maybe I'm getting on dangerous ground, but what you have is the sight &gt;&gt; that sets up the affections without anything registering from the soul yet. &gt;&gt; Or I'll just take it another way. Someone say, "Well, the way he looked at me or the way they didn't shake my hand." I've had that. &gt;&gt; They didn't shake my hand. There's a brother here. I missed shaking his hand today as he walked by because I was I was going to and then I got engaged with brother Gary White and uh and I missed brother John wherever he is. I'm sorry I missed shaking your hand, Brother John. I meant to do that and I got taken up. But I've had people that have said, "Well, they didn't shake my hand or that sister didn't shake my hand." And right away the reasoning went. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; and even the way even the way they looked, it didn't look quite right. And I know that they don't feel good. And then Satan is right there and said, "Oh, what an opportunity." &gt;&gt; And your then the imagination goes in. Then a memory goes in. Yeah, that happened another time. and Satan's saying, "That's going just the direction I want it to go." And pretty soon that person's feeling a rooe of bitterness. &gt;&gt; And they come to church and sit there and expect me to preach. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right, Brother Larry? &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. And I'm saying, "God, what's what's wrong? What's happened? I just like I got a stone wall here. What what's what's going on?" And he you got something over here and something over there and something over there. And Satan just having a he's just having a a field day &gt;&gt; with all that spirit realm. &gt;&gt; And God is doing everything he can &gt;&gt; to get that soul channel clear &gt;&gt; to bring them to believe the word. &gt;&gt; And once that channel is clear and the word comes and they say, "I disregard my feelings. &gt;&gt; I disregard my reasoning. I disregard my imagination. I disregard my memory. I disregard it all. And I believe what God is saying to me right now. I believe the preacher is to preach and is preaching for my benefit. I say, "Oh God, I receive it. I receive it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you'll find some rise from the soul. &gt;&gt; Oh, how wonderful it is. &gt;&gt; One channel to the soul, a control channel. But there's only one channel to the inside of that soul, an end time seed sign. And it shows that you are a seed. Now, I'm going to just close, but I if I if God leads me to pick this up again, here's where I really want to come to. We've been made a certain way. And God has given a word. He has delivered a word. I think I've convinced you today. And not that I needed to, but I believe that to help you to understand and and feel what God must have been thinking. And I'd like to just dramatize for the last about four or five minutes here. and God putting you together and just assembling you for this day that we're in. I'm going to send these people a message and it won't be an easy one to receive. They will not be able to reason it in their mind. they will not be able to feel that emotional attachment perhaps because I feel lot I see lots of people that are emotionally attached to the message but as far as I'm concerned they haven't got a revelation of the message that is why friends and I'm beginning perhaps on dangerous ground but that is why I think it's nice to maybe go and see you know Sunset Mountain and see the Eagle Rock and see the various places. But when I get right to the scripture, I never find any in the Old Testament trying to find the burning bush. I never find anybody in the New Testament making a big thing over where Jesus was born &gt;&gt; or where Jesus died &gt;&gt; or trying to find exactly where the cross was erected &gt;&gt; because it wasn't that kind of an attachment. &gt;&gt; I think it's fine to go there. I've gone into the tomb where they believe Jesus was. I've I've gone to where it it's believed that he laid, but that's not where my attachment is. &gt;&gt; I'm attached to what that Christ spoke. &gt;&gt; What he said. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the attachment. So, we're not attached to just things that uh you know move us or &gt;&gt; I saw uh you know we have uh maybe pictures and where the pillar of fire was here and it was actually photographed and I have I have such a reverence for that. I I carry it in my Bible. Maybe people wouldn't understand that. But I have a picture of Brother Brandham and it's well worn now with the pillar fire over his head because as far as I'm concerned, God Almighty visited Sam Houston Coliseum on that day and allowed that picture to be taken. That's a very very sacred thing to me. But that is not my attachment to this message or this messenger. My attachment is what he said. Amen. And &gt;&gt; that's why I say to you young men especially, take that word, take those messages and just read it and digest it and ponder it and and and and try to just say, "Holy Spirit, what is it that you're saying?" Now, this is what I come to say. And I just pray God help me to say it. We're sitting here today and I don't know what the future is. I trust with everything that's in me, I would dearly, dearly love to be part of that change and part of that rapture. But I want to say to this congregation and those that are streaming because God bless you and you send me emails and it's so encouraging. You got one from Switzerland this last week and how lovely it was and I just appreciate it with all my heart. But God made you not only a certain way but he made you for a certain time &gt;&gt; and he made you for a certain word. So he ordained the word and he designed the word for this generation. And and the prophet says the messenger the message the end time message who can say the last part of it meets the end time conditions. So now he's designed a message. He ordained it and he structured it and he and he brought up a messenger and brought him up through his terrible suffering and so on and and molded him and and crafted him until that message that he could carry that message. Then he carries the message over here. He's got people scattered all over the earth that are constructed a certain way and they've got a channel. You people have a channel and that channel was specifically given to you to receive the word for this hour, the promise of this hour so that you could believe that word and receive what that promise is. And that promise for this hour is the rapture. This is a rapture message. This is a rapture message. And that's why God gave you that channel. It's for this hour, for this moment. And that's what I want to conclude this service. That's why that channel was actually given to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's given to you for one purpose. &gt;&gt; And God in his mind says, "This channel, I'm giving it to these people to get them out of there. &gt;&gt; This channel that I'm giving these people is to defeat my arch enemy, death." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why the spirit of God that raised Christ from the dead, if if it dwell in you, &gt;&gt; it shall also quicken these mortal bodies, &gt;&gt; that spirit that was given to you, that's been given to this congregation, &gt;&gt; been given to this generation, &gt;&gt; it was crafted by God. It was designed by God. It was ordained by God. It was predestinated by God. And thus he sent you here &gt;&gt; with the facility and the capacity that you have. &gt;&gt; And I've done my best today &gt;&gt; to bring it to you in in simplicity and to and and and and in such a way so that you can see it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say to this congregation, it's time that we are no longer distressed and disturbed and live our lives according to this this superficial uh realm of this what this body experiences or what the spirit experiences. It is it's it's absolutely essential. It's vital that you live by the soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, how does that work?" Come and sit here and and and listen closely to what is preached and let it sink to the soul and set aside every feeling. Set aside every other thought. When you read the word, set aside every thought. When you hear a message, set aside every thought and say, "By this I live." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. By this I conduct my life. &gt;&gt; This shall be my instruction. &gt;&gt; This is the leadership of the Holy Spirit in my life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and you'll have great success. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why don't we stand, will you?

Our words will pass away. Man's words will pass away, but your words will never pass away. How we thank you, oh God, for for the message of the hour and how it just it like it dissects and opens us up and helps us to see ourselves and helps us to see where we're at. Oh God, I just want to give you praise and thanksgiving, Lord, today that you've ever saw fit to call us &gt;&gt; and to to bring us into this glorious light. Oh, it's a wonderful light. And we just want to give you thanks today, Lord.

What is it that you have to say to us as our brother Tom has been looking to you, Lord, over these number of days and perhaps a couple of weeks and just waiting to deliver the word that's on his heart. Oh God, I pray that the Holy Spirit will just move in. And I pray that you'll take the words that have been spoken today, Father, perhaps in utter simplicity, but let it let it just be indelibly marked upon the hearts of the people, oh God. I pray you'll bless them. Bless them that have come from so far, Lord Jesus. And we say, let your will be done. Just mold us and make us what you want us to be in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

And what I envision is channels and flu just blew skyhigh and all kinds of doubts and fears went back where they belong &gt;&gt; and questions and all of these reasonings and things. Hey, no. We live in a time and this is no surprise to you. People are tortured in their minds. &gt;&gt; Absolutely tortured. Don't get quiet on me. I start feeling I'm alone.

I'm going to let it just be blown clear. &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit, come &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. I'm calling for it to be done in the name of Jesus Christ by the preaching of the word.

Even if you just say that, I was made to believe God's word. &gt;&gt; God structured me in his mind before the foundation of the world. I was actually made to believe &gt;&gt; this word for this seasonal &gt;&gt; and I don't want to miss a day of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't want to miss a day of this glorious life &gt;&gt; in Christ. Oh wonderful Lord. I see you moving, Lord. I see the Holy Spirit moving. I'm sure that there's a milky bank, oh God, of faith that is building over the people now in the pillar of fire. Let it move from one to another. Oh God, I pray you'll just bring the people into a place where they're supercharged with faith in their heart to receive what they have need of in the name of Jesus Christ.
