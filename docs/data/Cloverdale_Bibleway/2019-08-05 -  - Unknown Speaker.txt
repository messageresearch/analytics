TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey man let's stand to her fetus reading welcome brother David and heir to the pulpit he's a pastor from France who has brought his family here to be with you at this camp I think that's uh that is a great honor for us brother David to have you great honor it says something about the camp also that he would want to bring his children because we I believe he believes that the Word of God myth is ministered and it has an effect with on the lives of his young people and that's what we want young people will have activities this afternoon will enjoy one another and maybe the eating hall but now we've come to this meeting not just to put in some time but to hear what the mind of God has for us and if you are desiring something from God this morning last night was a tremendous move of God tremendous word and I want you to know as a man that had gave his heart to the Lord since he's 21 I'm 65 and it has not changed a bit it has only grown deeper and stronger I want more every day it doesn't stop at a camp meeting it goes on and on Lord show me yourself reveal your word I want to walk with you Lord that's why we have camps not just to give you a a nice little experience and then go home and forget about it but the Holy Ghost can come down transform your lives that you will never be the same again but you will never be lukewarm in a lukewarm age that there will be a fire burning within your soul that you can say burn on Holy Spirit burn within me let me be the Church of the Living God in this last age that's why we have camp that's why a pastor has a burden that we would have these grounds for these many years and you see these ones that are behind cameras and behind the sound moves they were in camp they were in camp they were sitting where you are but God's got a hold of them and they've moved on and now they're the support and they want you to have an experience what they have experienced and it's more than the frock it's more than the shouting it's a deep inner experience when the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes and lives within your soul how thirsty are you this morning I I want to put on my hands at Lourdes I'm very thirsty I'm thirsty for a great move of the Holy Ghost within my life I don't want to be a just a statement that's made over a pulpit but I can say truly Lord fill me with your power your life your nature your love if that's your prayer this morning I just want you to lift up your heart to him lift up your heart lift up him way high and say Lord fill me with the Holy Ghost and fill me with fire we welcome you Holy Spirit to come into this tent this morning and we welcome the servant of the Living God to come and minister what God's put on his heart and I just want to say let's just welcome him in a very sweet way as we sing the little chorus welcome welcome Holy Ghost we welcome you Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is that your deepest desire that's all that matters Holy Ghost we welcome thee good morning Saints this is a celebration feast I'd like to see smiling faces was that a celebration there's no sad faces the word has been spoken already this is a victory camp and we see the painting behind us that was the skit of Joshua amen the walls of Jericho coming down Amon and I believe last night several walls of unbelief have come down but this morning is another surface amen and I say Holy Spirit come town amen and destroy every wall of unbelief Amen that's what camp is all about activities are great amen but the Holy Ghost is much greater Amon because that lasts forever Amon Lassa yesterday afternoon I was getting ready amen and I heard the screaming when they were playing the volleyball and and my mind went to the story of Jehoshaphat I heard screaming and I say wow they're screaming in the camp and that was like where the Tim said for for a ball game but the story of Jehoshaphat says it's an ink roller coaster one take much tournament on dad yeah Jehoshaphat said and he her cannoli Judah and he inhabitants of Jerusalem and thou king thus say the Lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by reading of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods Amen you shall not need to fight this battle Amon and Jehoshaphat bowed his head worship the Lord Haman the Lord once oh he he loves to dwell amongst the worship of his people that's why we welcomed the Oh holy spirits Haman and continues on to saved and he appointed singers unto the Lord and that should praise the beauty of holiness and as they went out before the army amen and this morning we have the generals here on the front line Haman when you see an Army in the natural the generals are somewhere hidden but here the channels are on the front line come on army of the Lord amen the battle is not yours the battle is the Lord's if Haman and the appointed Sith amen trumpet ears and as they went out before the army they say praise the Lord for His mercy endures forever amen and the army all those that were against them were smitten by their praise and you want to talk about worship amen when I heard you sing and shout Haman now we're talking Haman about this great warfare that is going on Satan try and playing with your mind Haman but just surrender to God this morning and start praising God then you see the walls crumbling town that's what it's all about Amen so may God bless you amen amen amen amen oh I'm under great expectation and we don't want to debate with Satan we don't want to negotiate with Satan amen we give him no options thus say the Word of God my lord I set me free amen glory be to God start saying the words start confessing the word and you see God will fight your battle a many many men certainly ground counted a great honor to be here standing before the redeemed of the Lord and I thank brother ed brother Tom the ministry amen for their trust and all they have done through the years for me personally for my family for the believers for the bride all over the world amen we ought to be so happy this morning no matter whether if you from this church no matter where you come from God gives us another opportunity to receive more of him a many many men so may God bless you amen and we are at the point of no return there's no turning back no turning back amen amen so let's take our Bibles our swords Naaman and this morning I have a message that's not just for prodigal that's for every person in here every person that is streaming every person that hears this message that's from for every brother every sister from the youngest to the oldest hallelujah we're gonna have camp brother Tom Laurie so let's open our Bibles to Psalms 42 Psalms 42 see men when you're there start with first one as their heart panted after the water Brooks so panted my soul after the O God my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God and the word thirst in Hebrew it's Iraq and it means it's too long for to cry for and brother branham he preached a sermon and in 65 and the 19th of September with which is entitled thirst and he uses exactly the same the same verse that we read so we just go a little further one more scripture reading in Psalm 63 verse 1 o God thou art my god early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh long it for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see the high power and thy glory so as I have seen the in the sanctuary because di'ja loving-kindness is fatter than life my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise you with joyful lips and when I remember the Abunda Tatum V in the night watches because thou has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy Wings will I rejoice may God add the blessing to the reading of his word if we just look before we pray do the word marrow the marrow if you look it up in Webster it is a nourisher and strengthener of the bones the other another definition is it's the best part he is the best part he is all that I need so I can lift up my hands in thy name glory let us pray dear Heavenly Father Lord we count it such a great honor and privilege father to be in thy presence and Lord God I pray father may you bless each and every one in here this morning father oh you blessed us last night we pray mayor in you the strength of thy servant brother Tim and father God we say once more Lord this camp is a victory camp and law we won't leave anyone behind us Lord we want everyone to be set free so I pray Lord may you take me out of the way and father may you minister to our hearts this morning Lord bless each and every one father bless all those that have labored father may you give them a special portion a special blessing or we pray and ask these things in Jesus Christ's name hey man hey man you may be seated sin thank you brother Tom hallelujah you know the Lord is so wonderful and so mighty and maybe you've heard it so many times but the mind of God is simply perfect as brother Tom was standing here not knowing anything about my notes Eamon but God knows and he knows what is needed for his people and as he was speaking he mentioned how thirsty are you that is my title this morning hey I'm under great expectation believers payment if the mind of God can tell brother Tom how thirsty are you there's a great blessing of God for us this morning hey man as for a subtitle I would like to take there is free refill that's why I'm saying that to everybody the youngest to the oldest there is free refill come on now so I'm asking you preach with me hey man when the warded word is being preached we want to water it with our pray say Amen that's beer amen so if we just reread songs and we see Haman David who was a man after God's own heart and if we look to his life we can say but he did some wrongs and he did dad but there was one thing he realized that he needed more of God he had a thirst in his soul my first my soul thirsteth after the Oh God hey man and today amen the greatest desire we should have it's not you just to have a nice camp activities can be great and believe me yeah I've seen many years been here many years the activities are great but what what is far more greater is a touch of the Holy Ghost hallelujah so that's all that matters amen so let's not focus on what will happen after now is the time to receive from God hey many man if you look to King David he had all he could dream of he had all the riches you can think of and in today's language we would say he was a very successful person hmm he's a great somebody cuz often that's what you know if you don't do this I all we hear that that person is a great somebody you know what the world calls great the Lord calls foolish mmm-hmm but David in you with all his riches oh his army that he could have he could never quench the thirst of this soul now the soul deepest thirst is for God Himself who has made us so that we can never be satisfied without him so no matter how much you try to quench that thirst with the things of the world you'll never be satisfied so we might as well be very clear this morning you will never be satisfied unless you quench that thirst with God everyone can say I need more of God everyone can see you and believe you but God he knows what's in your hearts desire you can fool the pastor you can fool your brother your sister your mom your dad but you don't fool God so let's take of our masks now and be Sisir before God let's not waste our time oh brother David I still got time I'm young I want to appreciate my life if you really want to appreciate your life run to Christ because he will come the word says in a twinkling of an eye so let's not put two tonight service tomorrow morning service or next week next year what you can have this morning hallelujah in this last age Satan he's very subtle oh he wants us to keep us away from the word and the power of God and he wants to trap us by all means now if we look to the natural brother branham he he spoke about the verse we read and he says as the heart panted for the WaterBrook so my soul thirst after deal God if that deer don't get the water he's dead and if you can get to Christ not the church the devil tries to put a force thing in you there tries to make you satisfied that great thirst in you by saying oh yeah I joined church I'm in Bible way I'm in this church they even English a ver now I'm this man of that church that's just almost as bad as doing something else I'm presbyterian I'm Pentecostal I'm Catholic I'm Baptist that dumb mean one thing to God you can be any church member and go to hell like a Martin in its box do you hear me so it's we're not I'm not talking to the church members now I'm talking to the royal seat of Abraham and enough is enough we draw the line except a man be born again he will in no ways wise enter in well I do this I do that I do the other you need to be born again to enter in God don't recognize anything else except a man be born again of the spirits and of the water he will in no wise enter in so it's a clear message believers brother David it's a simple message maybe it is but is a capital message that is the most important thing in our lives is the new birth hallelujah brother branham he tells a story of the about the dear Amen and he says now being a hunter I'm acquainted with deers and several of you are hunters you're acquainted with tears but I love it how he explains it he says hey man I'm acquainted with action of them and if you know it is as long as a deer can get to the water brother he can revive in a second there is something in a deer that when he gets to the water his wounds will heal mmm his strength comes back and there is something that is in you you may be hurt you may have scarves you may have had a miserable life so far don't you worry come to the water and drink their free refill and you will see strength coming back my scars being here so don't give me a cheap excuse my life that's my life that God is still the same this morning you know brother David I'm different really as the heart panted for the water Brooks oh my soul thirst after thee O God brother Branham says he's wounded the hounds of hell is after every one of you so your story ain't different brother David and I've seen and believe me some young people say oh you know I I go to these places but I know what I'm doing that's where Satan wants you to bring on his ground no negotiation I'm a son of God you're a son of God you're a daughter of God we don't need to negotiate we don't need to discuss thus say the Word of God payment so the hounds of hell is after every one of you he only wants to get you away from the shepherd once mmm oh you know it's only Wednesday night service I think I'm gonna skip Wednesday night service you're listening to Satan's subtle lies you know brother Tom brother it's only one service one service can be enough one service can be enough that's why this camp is this is a celebration camp because there's freedom when the word is being preached Amen we want to embrace the word and said that is for me I say Amen and I don't want to listen to the lies of Satan anymore amen that's what brother Brown says he only wants to get you away from the shepherd once oh so don't play that game oh that dear he has to find WaterBrook or perish Oh God he says let that be our soul today from the back to the front let that be our soul today wounded if you can't find a what a Brook the hounds will get him pretty soon but if you can only find out water if we only can get that kind of life sis brother branham blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled may not be the motifs of this church this morning can we say Amen Sudan may not be our motives this morning amen amen amen may our affections be turn away from the things of the word the cares of the world and let's focus on him how thirsty are you there's free refill the hounds of hell is right behind you crippled and wounded by sin you see only get away once from the Shepherd and you will be crippled wounded because the hounds of hell are behind every one of you brother David what a message well I want to get you out of this risky situation where you think you're smarter than God the hounds of hell are behind each and every one but glory be to God there is a fountain oh where we can drink freely a many many many men now we've got to find Christ or perish and when that sort of a desire gets into a man's heart he will find Christ when you get into that shape and that's what these meetings are all about when we get into that condition where it ain't the games that matter we're the only thing that matters is Christ when the brown tabernacle pitched through that place the little isms will drop out the doors the differences will all be settled out and Christians will be Christians we heard reddit and preach there's no place for sissies brothers are brothers sisters are sisters we don't want to be shaped after the world I want to be safe according to the word Christians are Christians oh and this will be I love it and this will be a spot that'll be talked of around the world when any congregation of people will thirst for God in that manner come on say sir let us search for God in that matter brother David wha what are you excited about what am i excited about I had a life-changing experience amen and it's burning inside of me and my prayer is for each and every one of you you have the same experience that baptism of the Holy Ghost oh you walk will be different you'll talk will be different your songs will be different your price will be different if you want a reality how desperate should we be when you get to a place that you want Christ so bad you must have him or perish you can't sleep at night not because we want to talk about this song or about that movie about this or about that come on now you can't sleep at night a many men you can eat you've just got to find him blessed are you when you hunger and thirst after righteousness because you'll find eternal life hello how brother Branham says it when the church gets to that place that is got to find Christ or die till not until that time I say enough is enough enough is enough we don't want to have another camp meeting we want a revival to break out amen so the way to have a revival is to be so desperate so thirsty oh brother David I've been blessed three weeks ago five years ago did you lose your thirst David being such a rich man he said my soul thirsteth after deal god that's what Satan wants to bring into your mind I'm satisfied so young people how did you come to come this year maybe you've never seen brother David that doesn't matter at all I mean nobody try to tell everybody about somebody who can save anybody come on now I'm determined to receive from God it's a matter of life or death Romans 8 says for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain are we groaning are we desiring so much more of Christ Webster says it's a painful desire first thing for God should be such a now brother David do I have to have pain the there if it doesn't get to the water it dies and believe me brothers and sisters if you don't get to Christ you die you can be as somebody in school you can be as somebody at work but that has no importance I want to be christ-like we know we live in laude sear Amen so it's a dry and desert land lukewarm I'm in the message for so many years has the message become common to you I've been to church all my life has it become so common that we lost our thirst for quote for more of God forbid Satan tries to fill you with its filth he tries to replace that thirst with all his dirt we live in an age where we have so many varieties of drinks when you go to the grocery store you found hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of drinks it's amazing that's the natural but Satan brings you all kinds of drinks all kinds of filth to satisfy your thirst now do you know that all drinks no matter what it is soda tea coffee juices they have one thing in common that is water redbull there's water in it I know some of you brothers drink that that's the only pour pure thing amen amen and we see in the world that is the thing that is lacking scientists say that in 2050 we will be lacking drinking water believe me I'll be gone in a desert in a dry and country land everything is Fric ly starchy and that's what the people are without the baptism of the Holy Ghost they become Sparky correctly you preach the article but wait until that satisfaction comes the satisfaction portion of the fullness of the Holy Ghost comes and then the joy Belsen wolf shouting will ring amen let the bells of victory sound very clear because there is victory in the camp let us prophesy again it is joy unspeakable and full of glory when you full with God you can't be starchy you can't sit still ransom when God does something for you oh yeah you will shout and scream I'm not talking about emotion hey man I love how Joshua and the skits he said Haman when we go this time around the walls I just don't want any worship god bless you brother Joshua was it Marco I think it was huh yeah brother Marco god bless you I don't want any with any kind of worship I want to worship from the soul Haman and our Joshua tells us this morning when you hear the word of God I want to respond to that word say let it be so Lord amen glory be to God if Jehoshaphat would praise God Amen when he heard the word of God Amen he praised her and God fought the battle what about us this morning he is still the same the great God Jehovah a many many many men has brother Branham he's continued saying has he become the very fountain of your life or are you trying to push him away and satisfy your longing with a list of the world or any other trick of the enemy are you trying to satisfy this longing by joining a church and neglecting the great spiritual birth which is the only remedy that you can be saved by there ain't no shortcuts there ain't no deviations there's one way be ye born again hallelujah now what happens if a buddy deer comes around that's how brother branham calls it if you're not a buddy deer comes along and says you know I know where there is a mud hole down there and if you've got somebody's so-called buddies if those buddies take you away from the Word of God there are nobody brothers and sisters oh you know it's just for wanan and i know i know my position be careful Satan is subtle he ain't a buddy dear there he's a trick of Satan trying to trap you we don't want to go through a mud hole we won the pure water of God aimin ho and there is nothing that can satisfy that thirst that is in a human being until God comes in you must have it or die and no persons has a right to try to hush or satisfy that holy stirs that is in him it's ungodly to do so if you're thirsting for God there's only one thing that can satisfy it that's to meet God that's what these meetings are all about well brother brother David yesterday was wonderful and it was but don't listen to the reasoning of Satan saying oh I had my blessing yesterday there's free refill you know us Europeans when you go to a restaurant you pay for a coke there's no free refill so the first time years ago I came here free refill ask my kids free refill oh that's the natural what about the spiritual there are so many blessings for you how thirsty are you now brother branham he warns us and he says if you're thirsting for God be sure it's God you found he's warning us here now that's Satan the hounds of hell are behind us and you can be sincere yeah I'm thirsting for God but Satan will come and try to give you something to satisfy that thirst be certain you found you find God okay he will simply try to make a way so that you're satisfied don't be satisfied unless you have Christ unless you have a born-again experience now we don't want to take that lightly our attitude determines the results Satan will do all he can to give you mind battles he'll do all he can to stop you from coming to Christ remember those that were there last Sunday about this plane it is a struggle amen to reach that barrier once it gets beyond the sound barrier so I know several of you were here at the altar and there's a great battle going on when the world is being preached but the word is still Almighty Menem but satan he will come and say no don't go to the altar you don't need to go to the altar and what if what if brother tom or brother ed sees you going to the altar what does it matter the deer has one desire it needs to find water or it'll die so no matter who or what may think anybody I want to come to God for more of him don't let Satan play with your mind we run to Christ God still gives us the opportunity to run to Christ to be filled with him how thirsty are you mm-hmm now we see that Satan he tries to prefer to pervert dissatisfying on the soul that thirst of the soul he tries to give you everything to satisfy it hey man and it continues everything is perverted right ready Tim gave us stats I was blown away he gave us stats that's reality so there's nothing in this world there's nothing that Satan can give you to satisfy your thirsty soul but what is being preached here is nothing but the Word of God the pure Word of God that's the only thing that can satisfy your hungry soul so Satan perverted everything he has perverted so gradual until it's become the most deceitful age age that any human being ever lived in so it is a dry and there's a place this scripture applies to today completely dry oh yeah people can do all kinds of things but they're so dry so dry blessed are we believers to be sitting in his presence let's never take that for granted never take the Word of God so it's common to me now we know there's a control tower of the soul then there's one for the body and many times these warr one against the other what's the great trouble today too many people try to live between those two desires you cannot be sitting on the middle of the fence where it's hidden remember this either you serve God or you serve Satan there's no in-between up to us to choose how thirsty are you thirsty a natural thing it's just simply something that God has given us given a desire and that's the control there's a control tower to that desire and this ters this control tower that sets where energy in the man's heart is something something that God gave him to warn him of the desires that is needful for him what is needful not what you think that's where Satan's playground is that's the control tower I want to listen to that's what is needful for me give me more of you Lord Jesus I'll have lujah and we know the story about the Indian a man that says I have two dogs in me a white one and a black one Roy brown says oh yeah and which one wins the battle I want to do right and doing wrong and there's a white and a black dog so the chief says what matters is the one that I feed the most mm-hmm so little bride what are you feeding on feeding on Facebook Twitter Internet films snapchat all this chunk of satan it is brother David we heard preach against it same tries one thing to get you away from the Shepherd only one time he's the great Shepherd he is the great Shepherd so he gives all this chunk to keep you busy I think I mentioned it last last meeting busy means being under Satan's yoke or are you feeding on the unfailing body Word of the Son of Man that's what matters that's all that matters to be filled with him and him alone the Word of God tells us that we we must be born again there is no other way brother David you know my character my past my family I was born so-and-so and it's true I don't know what will you families but brother branham he gives us an example in a paradox he says now the genes in the father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they are converted still remains the flesh that's been interviewed out to this boy therefore the boy has got a complex in him listener just like from his mother's family and they are not forgiving they will not apologize and that's where that boy stands I said to the father no no matter how you've raised him up now look at your family to the mother there are a bunch of people they're very independent irreverent to religion hmm you're the only one of all your sisters then he says brother branham talking to the mother of all your sisters and brothers and you are sweet kind and forgiving what does that so don't give me the excuse my mama's like that my dad is like that brother Brandon said I'm the son of yeah my father he's an alcoholic Satan will give you all kinds of excuses but don't give me excuses take the Word of God what Mesa you're sweet you have received the Holy Ghost that's the thing that made you tender and sweet it's not your people anymore it's your Christ that lives in you then I said to the boy look at your family practically all of them are drunks and so forth and how Moody and high tempered and high-strung he talks to their father now but you're not you're kind of forgiving what is it the Holy Spirit you'll know more what you are its Christ in you and he continues now he brings it to their their son now and I'm bringing it to you all now now that same thing has to happen to your son the father says oh I know my son he went to the altar we baptize him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ brother brand says that maybe all right all the outward motions he might be identified as a believer with the believers but until he is regenerators born again I'd advise that young man to never marry a woman he'll make hell honored for her until that gentle sweet forgiving spirit of Christ comes in [Applause] that's all Lee the only thing that matters is for him to come in until Christ comes in then he continues to say in his intellectual she's trying his best to overcome he can do it that's strong he can do it because the battle is the Lord's listen how he never overcome it Dave it ain't on him Christ will have to overcome it when he lets Christ in then he's already overcome then so just let Christ come and amen and you see a life your life being completely changed brother John will do things a little different today it's calm brother David what do we have here a vessel the Bible talks about there are vessels of Honor and I refer to 2 Timothy 2:20 or Romans 9 21 there are vessels of Honor and this honor I want to be a vessel of Honor so here we have a vessel and inside yes there are ping-pong balls but they represent something to Timothy 3:2 speaks about the last days how the people would be and we heard last night that all these little things you can call them little but a little demon is a demon so all this is what lovers of themselves covetous boasters proud disobedience and thankfulness I just wrote a few down here heading it while brother David I don't have all this inside of me don't worry we'll come to it jealousy rebellion lust selfishness hot-tempered aggressive bitterness complexes frustration social-media addictive stubbornness religion spirits okay that is the vessel and now there can be only one ping-pong ball in the vessel or many there is only one remedy that is to be filled with the water of God so now what happened Satan is subtle you go to church I felt good brother Tom listening to the word it was good it was very good and I went last Sunday I think I'll stop hmm nothing happened nothing happened brother Tom they told me to come and hear the word and nothing happened subtle sing but let me tell you stupid Satan what we need to do is to continue every good thing is good as long as we keep on doing it if you want to go strong grow strong is read your Bible pray everyday that you may grow strong so okay brother David I continue as long as you keep you know feeling on the Word of God normally something should happen something should happen hey that's what it they were stuck sorry so if you keep on feeding on the Word of God what will happen is all these ping-pong balls representing now I'm gonna help because of the heat they were stuck you see they're coming that's what we need listen now Satan will come around and he will tell you you ain't what you what you were that's Loudy see ya you become lukewarm because they're still if I ask anybody in the back what do you see do you see that part here thank you brother I don't know who said no you still see ping-pong balls here but keep on drinking of the fountain that never runs dry and what happens they will all go out I'm helping now for the sake of time listen the good thing I love that part now you don't see any more orange do you the good thing is when you filled with Christ Satan will come around you know he can try but he can only stay on the surface the Word of God tells us resist the devil and he will flee from you so that's the good news brothers and sisters Satan can come around but unless you fill with his presence Amen he has no more impact on you and that's what these meetings are all about [Applause] Brennan says water is Christ his holy spirits in the message a prisoner a prisoner brother relative mentioned prison is protection I'd like to make this statement God always has to take any man that will serve and truly to be his prisoner a man has to surrender every ambition he's got everything that he is everything his life soul body will ambitions and everything else and become a complete prisoner to Christ who is the word to serve God God is looking for prisoners he's always done it you might searches through the scripture the man has to be a prisoner to Christ against anything therefore you cannot be connected with anything but Christ and here we are living in a connected age some of you have two phones or a mobile phone and iPad sorry or any kind of pad but what matters here you cannot be connected with anything but Christ then God can use you until then he can't when God gets you to be his prisoner then you can do nothing but what the Spirit says do Paul with all his great aunt elects he was taught by Gamaliel to be a great priest or Rabi some day and he had high ambitions so it is great intellect he still needed the fire of God you know what fire is still the oldest type of sterilization and we need the fire of the Holy Ghost in our lives to burn out everything that is contrary to his word now he had high ambitions you know ambition and adoption begins with the letter A but adoption is the ambition of God for you so my ambition here has is none importance I want to be connected to Christ he was intellectually a great man great authority great man in the nation but he had to sacrifice every bit of it to become part of God to express Jesus Christ Moses his intellectuals he had to lose them in order to find Christ so don't come with Europe high-minded intellects or you artificial intellect that's now the daily thing you're gonna write some algorithms and you know oh yeah they do they do a lot of things but believe me artificial intelligence if you ask the question can a man walk on water no because the law of gravity says that you will sink but hey let me talk you about my Lord Almighty therefore you cannot rely on your intellect you cannot Lyonne artificial intelligence hey man he is my Intel actor he is my lorry Moses he had to have a life-changing experience amen amen and it's only when he got that experience Haman when he met the pillar of fire that he could go out amen and call for flies and flies came into creation because he had a prisoner that Pharaoh couldn't pay off with nothing Satan will come around and try to pay office why don't you come you'll be famous you have much money oh you beat the man you'll have all the fashion clothing yo-yo fashion clothing junk clothing yeah I want to been connected to Christ so I don't want to be paid of by anything fara couldn't pay off with nothing nobody else could turn him no way he was a complete prisoner in the chains of God's Word bound up only to us said the Lord the people were all the same but when Moses saw him after their experience with the pillar of fire what did he see I'm asking you the question what did he see he saw a free people and this morning I see a free people in front of me I respond to the Word of God that our first thing in their soul in a dry and but they hear the word and they come drink and drink and drink to be completely filled with this power fair so only slaves fair every morning so only slaves but Moses saw there's victory in the camp and there's victory in this camp Haman thus said the word of God hey man he is still the God that delivers he says till the God that fills that seals with the Holy Ghost yeah that's God's plan for his bride God sent in our generation a prophet a many many men and God said Melchizedek went to meet Abraham and Sarah he gave them a message Laurie that message transformed their bodies and God gave us a message let that message never become common to us because that's the Word of God that is transforming us this word is transforming me changing me molding me into his image revelation 21 and he said unto me it is done I am the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto you and to him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely that's God's desire and we need to be washed by the water of the word how thirsty are you this morning listen the same water that softens the potato hardest the egg hallelujah that is shouting material the same water that softens the potato hardens the egg it's about what you are made of not the circumstances or the situation when the word of God is being preached through the Royal sea of God something is happening to others for me it is life-changing give me more of God the woman had the well a few more moments I'm still in my time a woman either well her situation was bad she was another kind of person that was perfect and then she met the master Jesus had a need to go through Samaria there was a seed laying there and God had to go there Brotherton he spoke about Legion here we speak about another predestination scene and this morning he has need to come through Bob awaken because there are some souls that are thirsting for more of God and first thing remember is a painful desire it's a man it's life or death it's such a painful desire that I cannot eat I cannot sleep I want to find God John 4:13 says jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst again but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life now does that mean that she never drank again mm-hmm that was naturally but Jesus was speaking spiritually if you drink of my water if you drink of me you'll never thirst again and what was her reply the woman said unto him Sir give me of this water that I thirst not a man and this morning how thirsty are we thirsty are we have we been sitting in church for 50 60 or I don't know 20 years or five years now we're not thirsting anymore far be it the woman replied she knew she wasn't perfect she knew she had lots of those in her life but then she said let me give let get me this water that I thirst no more and the only water that can quench her thirst thing soul is the Lord God Almighty give me over the water she didn't go on Facebook to ask the general opinion let me contact a little friend I have two thousand seven hundred or twenty five thousand connecting friends so called I'll ask their opinion no she replied to the Word of God give me of this water that I thirst no more this is the water that I want to be filled with young people that's the water that we should desire the Holy Ghost to be filled with him and nothing else in the beginning and we're gonna skip that part but this water in the beginning God he was this great big fountain of seven colors he became from spirit the great pounds of the rainbow of God who had no beginning no end that whole big rainbow had to come in a theophany and then the world was made flesh and dwelled among us come on now he is this inexhaustible fountain inexhaustible fountain so you can drink there's free refill hallelujah all that God was he poured into Christ he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily and Jesus says in John 7 in the last days the grey day of the feast Jesus stood and cried If any man thirst let him come to me and drink he died believe it on me as a Christian scriptures has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water that's what I need for my life that's what we need for our lives the devil he don't care how much you can shout if your heart's desire is not right the only thing he doesn't want you is to drink see Reverend says you come and drink that's what this meeting is for now for you to drink hey it's your responsibility it's plenty of God to be given but our desire determines the results plenty to be given it's an inexhaustible fountain try to exhaust God it's impossible how do I do that brother David hey we just heard brother Brown say that's what this meeting is for now if we get ourselves lined up with the Word of God and hold on to it what can I do brother branham what can I do to be lined up with the Word of God just take it in your heart and believe it with all your hearts he is the an exhaustible fountain of eternal life to make manifested any divine promise of his Bible to who to anybody that'll believe it yes sir the only thing you do is drink come to the fountain and drink drink until you're satisfied you cannot exhaust him the message can be clear you cannot exhaust him I know he is here I know he'll do the exceedingly abundantly if we'll just let him do it you know what a great thirst is a great joy when quenched in time so let's not wait until tomorrow the following week the next year come and drink now there's plenty to be given are you satisfied with what you have how could you I want more of God I want more of God every day in my life and that's what this meeting is about for us to come and drink and we have to make a complete surrender the Word of God tells us that he wants to fill every fiber of our body every fiber I'll come back on that in a few seconds we must lean upon God and God alone amen as long as I got myself some of myself and there then God cannot do brother Branham himself he says he's the one talking about himself that gets lazy and until I can get out of the way that's where God can do things that I don't even know anything about that's what God wants for us we keep God out of our lives because our own selves don't put it on the preacher don't put it on God because of our own selves but the good news there's free refill I'm soon gonna be closing now how many know the story about a young man Glenn Cunningham anybody heard that story if you have good repeating it new this man young man they called him also the Kansas flyer this little boy he went into a country school house and it was heated by an old-fashioned potbelly coal stove and this eight-year-old boy named Glenn Cunningham had the job of coming to school early every day so that he could use kerosene to start a fire and warm the room before his teacher and his classmates arrived so every day he ran to school to heat up the school the class now one day somebody had changed the container of kerosene and used and fill it with gasoline and disaster struck the class and the teacher arrived to find a schoolhouse engulfed in flames terrified on realizing that Glenn was inside there rushed and then and managed to drag him the unconscious little boy out of the flaming building he had major burns all over the lower part of his body he was brought to the hospital the doctor told his mother that her son would surely die which was for the best really for the terrible fire had devastated the lower half of his body but that brave boy didn't wanna die Glenn made up his mind that he would survive he was determined and somehow to the amazement of the physicians he did survive yet when the mortal danger was passed he again heard a doctor and his mother speaking quietly the mother was told that since the fire had destroyed so much flesh in the lower part of his body that it would almost be better that he died since he was doomed to have a lifetime crippled in a wheelchair but he made up his mind he wouldn't be crippled he would walk and I don't go going all the details the story is wonderful that the flesh was completely melted in a way it was impossible to use his limbs but he was determined ultimately he was released from the hospital and this mum and dad had to massage his legs there was no feeling no control nothing yet his determination that he would walk was as strong as ever hallelujah he wasn't in bad one and he if he wasn't in bad he was confined to the wheelchair and one sunny day his mother wheel him out of the yard out into the yard to get some fresh air this day now I'm saying this day instead of sitting there he threw himself from the chair Glenn pull himself across the grass dragging his legs behind him he worked his way to the white picket fence bordering their lot with great effort he raised himself up the fence then stake by stake he began dragging himself along the fence resolved that he would walk he started to do that every single day ultimately through his daily massages Glenn's ayran persistence and his resolute determination he did develop the ability first to stand up then to walk haltingly with help than to walk by himself and then miraculously to run don't give up don't give up I have determined this day Glenn began to run through school he ran for the sheer joy of running and being able to run he ran everywhere that he could the people in his town would often see him run by by his own way having a huge smile on his face Oh believe me when you take of this water you will never thirst again you have a big smiling face and God wants to give so much more to each and every one now this little boy he had a positive attitude as strong as it as well as a strong religion his favorite bible verse was Isaiah 40:31 that those who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount a will we with wings like eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint Winningham Glen competed in the 1500 meter event in the 1932 and 1936 Summer Olympics he finished 4th and 2nd Glen competed in the 15-hundred meter event no in 32 Cunningham won the Sullivan medal in 34 he set the world record for the Myron at 4.0 sex 6 which stood for 3 years and he also set a world records in the 800 meter in 1936 and the indoor mile in 1938 come on here's a boy burnt doctors gave up on him many people may have give up on you Satan may repeatedly say to you you're a nobody you're not worth it don't listen to the lies that boy was determined and he went to the Olympics he got records because he was determined that he was going to walk and I pray this morning that you are determined to come and drink of the water that he gives freely that's what it's all about God strategy is to take empty vessels and shake the world with them empty vessels no orange ping-pong balls emptied ourselves but filled with the Holy Ghost why don't we stand musicians that's what we need today is empty vessels so God can fill enough God cannot use you as long as you're filled up with yourself or with anything that is contrary to his word brother Branham gives us a quote and says the only thing a tree has to do that is planted by that water is to drink drink and spread out drink drink and spread out do you want to be a cactus in a desert land no I don't want to be starchy I don't want to be prickly I want to praise God hallelujah where the water of God is flowing flowing flowing so we can spread out and spread out you can play softly far in Europe the last months two months we had a heat wave [Music] you know what the message was they gave to everyone young and all [Music] even if you don't feel like drinking drink anything and that's what Lao DC is all about Satan wants to satisfy you with something telling you you don't need to drink but come drink of the fountain of living water that's what we need even if you don't if you don't feel like drinking the word has been spoken come on drink this isn't a fountain that that can never run dry we need a revival since brother Branham we need a digging time dig dig the deeper you dig the more water you're going to get get down to where the water can really come pouring out of Emmanuel's veins [Music] today he says when we know we need a revival we know we need a stirring amongst us and it'll not take a doctor of divinity it'll take a weeks
