[0:43] [Music]
[0:48] Just speak to him from your heart this
[0:49] morning now. Oh, your love is life to
[0:54] me.
[0:55] [Music]
[0:56] My trueest longing, my deepest me.
[1:03] Without you, I'm going. I don't know
[1:07] where I be.
[1:09] Your love is to me.
[1:16] Lord, prepare
[1:19] me
[1:20] to be a sanctuary,
[1:26] pure and holy,
[1:31] tried and true
[1:36] with thanksgiving.
[1:41] I'll be a living
[1:46] sanctuary.
[1:50] Oh, for you.
[1:54] Yes, Lord. Prepare me in my heart, Lord.
[2:00] And you
[2:09] try and true
[2:14] with
[2:18] I'll be a living
[2:23] sanctuary
[2:28] for
[2:30] [Music]
[2:34] Amen.
[2:35] &gt;&gt; I trust that's your desire this morning.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, may the fire of God fall on this
[2:42] little vessel.
[2:43] &gt;&gt; Prepare me, Lord.
[2:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. To be a house for you.
[2:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Want to greet each and every one
[2:50] of you into the house of the Lord this
[2:52] morning. Trust you brought your little
[2:54] lick of fire and you're just expecting a
[2:56] wonderful time in the presence of the
[2:58] Lord. He deals with our lives individual
[3:01] by individual
[3:03] &gt;&gt; that affects a family that affects a
[3:06] church,
[3:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[3:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, individually, we want the Lord
[3:10] to deal with us
[3:12] &gt;&gt; today. Amen.
[3:16] We've got a
[3:18] special by the Cochman family. I think
[3:20] we've got all two of them that were able
[3:23] to remain with us. So, maybe they could
[3:26] come and sing for us this morning. and a
[3:28] couple of songs maybe while they're
[3:30] coming and getting ready. Uh there's a
[3:32] green Mercury villager in the parking
[3:34] lot. I've got a license plate number
[3:36] here, but there's probably only two or
[3:38] three green villagers out there. So, if
[3:40] you've got one, maybe go check it and uh
[3:42] make sure the lights aren't on, so you
[3:43] have a battery when you leave the
[3:45] service this morning. You love the Lord.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we just stand together?
[3:50] We'll pray and ask the Lord's blessings
[3:52] upon the day. It's his day. We're in his
[3:56] house and we want him to have the
[3:58] preeminence this morning. Brother
[4:00] Nathaniel, why don't you come and Yeah.
[4:02] Come and lead us in a word of prayer. We
[4:05] just ask the Lord and invite him for if
[4:07] he comes, that makes it all worth it
[4:10] all, doesn't it? We want to remember.
[4:12] Come on up, Brother Nathaniel. Got a
[4:13] couple of prayer requests that uh we
[4:16] want to make known. Brother Nathan, I'm
[4:17] sorry I call you Nathaniel. It's a long
[4:19] version, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah.
[4:22] um a testimony from uh Sister Grace Bey
[4:24] thanking the Lord for healing her throat
[4:27] from a virus just a few weeks ago.
[4:29] Brother Steve Rivas is asking for prayer
[4:32] for uh his aunt Anna and her son live in
[4:36] Southern California and have just called
[4:39] requesting more information about the
[4:40] message that we believe and he's asking
[4:43] for wisdom and that the Lord would deal
[4:44] with her heart. And we want to remember
[4:47] Richard Drake. Um he's at home dealing
[4:50] with an uncontrollable cough and asking
[4:52] that the Lord would deliver him. If you
[4:54] have a need upon your heart, just as we
[4:55] go to prayer this morning, just make it
[4:57] known by the uplifted hand.
[5:02] Let's just bow together.
[5:08] Lord Jesus, it's just good to come into
[5:11] your presence, Father, and
[5:14] to worship you and in song and in
[5:18] prayer,
[5:20] thanksgiving and praise, Lord, for the
[5:24] shed blood of Jesus Christ.
[5:27] That cleanses us from all
[5:28] unrighteousness and makes us clean and
[5:31] pure and whole in your sight, Lord.
[5:34] &gt;&gt; Where would we be without that blood,
[5:36] Lord?
[5:38] [Music]
[5:39] Oh God, I thank you for that tremendous
[5:42] sacrifice that was made on our behalf,
[5:45] Lord.
[5:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, when you climbed Goltha's hill,
[5:49] you became our sin. Lord, you who knew
[5:53] no sin, Lord. You became sin that we
[5:56] might be free. Oh Lord,
[5:59] all eternity isn't enough to praise you,
[6:01] Father, and just give you praise for
[6:03] your great plan of redemption, Lord.
[6:08] We bless your name, Lord Jesus.
[6:11] &gt;&gt; We call upon your spirit this morning to
[6:14] come and move in our midst. Oh father,
[6:17] we've come to hear from you, Lord Jesus.
[6:21] Come to sit at your table, Lord, and
[6:23] feed from the mana that you have
[6:25] prepared for us, oh God.
[6:28] Lord, we've not come to hear from a man,
[6:30] oh God, but we've come to hear from you,
[6:32] Jesus.
[6:34] I pray that you'd come, Lord, in your
[6:36] sweet presence. Oh, Father.
[6:39] Lord, help us to get everything out of
[6:40] the way. Oh Lord Jesus, forgive us, oh
[6:44] God, where we've failed you. Oh God,
[6:46] forgive us of our iniquities, Lord.
[6:49] Search our hearts, Lord Jesus.
[6:52] Your great pillar of fire moving to and
[6:55] fro, Lord. Oh God, shining your word
[6:59] down upon our hearts, Lord Jesus.
[7:02] Oh God, if our faith's not lining up
[7:04] according to your will, Lord, I pray
[7:06] that you'd just fine-tune us. Oh God,
[7:09] correct us, oh Lord. Adjust our
[7:12] attitudes, Lord. Give us more love, Lord
[7:14] Jesus. We need more of you, oh Lord.
[7:19] Oh God, we're living in a very dark
[7:21] hour, oh God, but you are the great
[7:23] light that has shine in this darkness,
[7:25] Lord.
[7:27] Father, that prophet told us that at
[7:29] just a hour before dawn, the darkness
[7:32] just congeals. Oh God, but Lord, we're
[7:36] looking to you this morning, Lord. We're
[7:39] looking to you and we're going to live,
[7:41] Lord. We are living this morning, Lord
[7:43] Jesus.
[7:45] Oh, how we love you, Lord. And we just
[7:48] yearn for more of you, oh God.
[7:51] We bless your name, Lord. We bless your
[7:53] holy name, Jesus. We love you, Lord. We
[7:57] love your holy presence, oh God.
[8:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, we praise you this morning, Lord
[8:03] Jesus. Thank you, Lord, for this
[8:06] testimony, oh God. We thank you, Lord,
[8:09] that you're among us, Lord, meeting our
[8:11] needs, oh Father, and we give you
[8:13] praise, oh Lord. We hold these requests
[8:16] up before you, oh God. Brother Richard
[8:19] with a a persistent cough. Oh Lord, you
[8:22] have provided his healing. Lord God,
[8:25] it's already ours. It's been paid for.
[8:27] Oh God, I pray that you'd come down in
[8:30] Brother Richard's life and confirm your
[8:32] word, Lord. Touch his body, Lord. Touch
[8:35] his throat. Heal him, oh God. Lord, I
[8:38] hear others coughing in the assembly,
[8:40] Lord Jesus. God, just move across this
[8:42] building this morning and touch each
[8:44] life, oh God. Heal our needs, oh Lord
[8:48] Jesus. And this request that brother
[8:50] Steve has brought in, Lord. Some
[8:52] relatives of his, Lord, asking for more
[8:54] of you, Lord. I pray that you'd reveal
[8:56] yourself to them, oh God. Open their
[8:59] eyes that they might see, Lord. Anoint
[9:02] their hearts to receive, oh God, we
[9:04] pray. Bless us this morning, Lord. We
[9:06] just humbly commit oursel and our ways
[9:09] unto thee, Lord. In Jesus name we ask
[9:11] it. Amen.
[9:14] Amen.
[9:16] God bless you each and everyone. You may
[9:17] have your seats.
[9:20] On behalf of Bible Way Christian Academy
[9:22] and all those that were able to go to
[9:24] the little concert last night, we just
[9:27] had a wonderful time. We appreciate the
[9:29] Cochman family coming and supporting the
[9:32] school and each one of you that came out
[9:33] and contributed. We just want to say
[9:36] thank you. So, we'll enjoy a couple of
[9:38] songs this morning. Amen.
[9:51] Amen. It's certainly good to be with you
[9:54] this morning.
[9:55] Appreciate the spirit we've had felt
[9:59] here and
[10:01] and uh we're a long way from our earthly
[10:03] home, but we're right at home amongst
[10:06] believers. Amen.
[10:08] &gt;&gt; People may look a little different than
[10:10] we're used to or act a little different,
[10:11] but when you get around believers,
[10:12] you're right at home.
[10:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I heard them whisper.
[10:25] They said, "How could this be? The same
[10:28] man
[10:31] killed a thousand
[10:33] armored soldiers
[10:37] with just an old jawbone he held in his
[10:42] hand. But look at him now where he
[10:47] stands.
[10:50] Look at him now where he stands.
[10:56] know I had been such a failure.
[11:02] How easily
[11:04] I've been begun.
[11:08] The locks of my hair they had taken.
[11:14] Deceived by a woman made helpless and
[11:19] mild.
[11:21] Blind now and led by a child.
[11:27] Blind now and led by a child.
[11:32] Just once more, Lord.
[11:35] Show me your will. My eneies mock me.
[11:41] They say you're not real.
[11:45] Though I have failed, you remember me
[11:49] still.
[11:51] Just once more, Lord.
[11:56] [Music]
[11:58] In the midst of their allout
[12:01] celebration,
[12:04] I pray. Oh God, hear my cry.
[12:11] Just once more, Lord, send your spirit.
[12:17] Come down and strengthen me just one
[12:21] more time.
[12:23] With him, Lord, now let me die.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; With them, Lord, now let me die.
[12:35] &gt;&gt; My hands found the two mighty pillars
[12:41] that held up the place I was in.
[12:47] I cried, "Avenge me, mine eyes, Lord."
[12:52] And the building came down upon all
[12:56] those within.
[12:59] God had prevailed in the end.
[13:05] My God had prevailed in the end.
[13:10] Just once more, Lord.
[13:13] Show me your will. My enies mock me.
[13:19] They say you're not real.
[13:23] Though I have failed, you remember me
[13:27] still.
[13:29] Just once more, Lord.
[13:31] [Music]
[13:35] Though I have failed, you remember me
[13:39] still.
[13:42] Just once more,
[13:45] Lord.
[13:47] [Music]
[13:50] [Applause]
[13:58] [Music]
[14:09] He knew
[14:11] each mistake.
[14:14] He knew the roads I take.
[14:20] He knew the hearts I'd break with every
[14:26] mile.
[14:29] [Music]
[14:32] He knew the dreams I sold.
[14:37] He knew each lie I told.
[14:42] He watched regrets unfold. Yet he loved
[14:48] me all. the wild.
[14:53] How could I
[14:56] ever love my God enough?
[15:03] &gt;&gt; Where would I be
[15:07] if not for his healing touch?
[15:13] I know that he
[15:18] knew me as I was.
[15:25] But he saw me through a Savior's
[15:30] eyes of love.
[15:36] He knew the loneliness.
[15:41] He saw my life a mess.
[15:46] He watched tears of distress each time I
[15:52] cried.
[15:57] And he knew I'd walk away.
[16:03] But he knew that another day
[16:08] he would whisper as I knelt to pray that
[16:12] he'd loved me all the while.
[16:19] How could I
[16:23] ever love my God enough?
[16:29] Where would I be if not for his healing
[16:37] touch?
[16:39] I know that he
[16:44] knew me as I was.
[16:51] But he saw me through a Savior's
[16:56] eyes of love
[16:59] [Music]
[17:03] through the blessed
[17:06] Savior's
[17:09] eyes
[17:10] of love.
[17:17] [Applause]
[17:45] Amen. We certainly appreciate that gifts
[17:48] of God. We get to enjoy them.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for coming and blessing
[17:54] us with those songs this morning,
[17:55] Brother Ben and Sister Caroline. Amen.
[17:58] As the Sunday school children make their
[18:00] way to their seats, why don't we just
[18:02] sing another chorus or two and prepare
[18:04] our hearts. May the ministering of the
[18:06] word deal in our lives today.

[20:44] If you'll just keep your mind stay on
[20:48] me.
[20:52] As our pastor comes this morning, my
[20:56] faith looks up
[21:00] to thee.
[21:10] save
[21:12] your
[21:20] me
[21:29] away.
[21:31] Oh, let me pro this day be holy.
[21:41] Let's stand at our feet together and
[21:42] sing that again. Oh my
[21:46] [Music]
[21:47] god.
[21:50] [Music]

[21:58] [Applause]
[22:13] Take all my guest.
[22:17] [Music]
[22:27] Oh, just one more time. Concentrate on
[22:30] him now.
[22:32] My faith

[22:42] He's our savior.
[22:44] [Music]
[22:50] Now

[22:58] Oh my guilt away.
[23:03] Oh, let me from this day.
[23:08] [Music]
[23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; Well, nice to see you standing and
[23:23] singing, but I have a few things I'd
[23:25] like to say before we turn to the word.
[23:27] So, I'll just have you have your seats
[23:29] once again.
[23:31] Uh so happy to have our brother and
[23:33] sister Cochman, their family. Uh three
[23:36] of the boys had to leave this morning.
[23:39] Uh you know, it's all work and some work
[23:42] duties. Uh, I I remember I'll just say
[23:46] to brother Sister Cochman and the three
[23:48] boys that had to leave, you can tell
[23:50] them I was uh I was way out in the
[23:53] wilderness with brother Brandham one
[23:54] time and and he was going to be there a
[23:56] couple weeks and and I could only be one
[24:00] week.
[24:01] Uh I had to go to work
[24:04] and uh so we were a long ways. I mean,
[24:07] we were probably 20 25 miles in on
[24:11] horseback off the Alaskan Highway.
[24:14] So, I uh I just felt so down.
[24:20] I'm sure if you were with Brother
[24:22] Brandham, you all would feel down, too.
[24:24] I just thought this this just isn't
[24:26] right. You know, I got to go to work.
[24:30] And uh and and and it seems that God
[24:33] knows just how to compound things to
[24:35] make them worse and worse.
[24:38] You know, have you ever had that? And
[24:41] the night before they'd seen some
[24:43] beautiful big mountain rams and that was
[24:46] actually that was the night we slept out
[24:48] under the tree and that's the one that
[24:51] Sister Marilyn painted that picture
[24:53] brother Brandham. That was the noon noon
[24:56] before.
[24:57] And so I just said to brother Bud
[25:00] casually, I said, "Well, will Blaine
[25:02] ride out with me?" Oh, no. He said, "You
[25:06] know, the horse knows its way out.
[25:09] The horse knows its way out. We're we're
[25:11] foring a river probably 15 or 20 times."
[25:15] And I've been on horses when they just
[25:17] walked into the bush and put their head
[25:19] against a tree and waited for your
[25:20] command. You know, what do you want them
[25:22] to do? And I didn't know my way out of
[25:25] there 25, 30 miles. And uh we woke up
[25:28] that morning and guess what? We were in
[25:32] the biggest snowstorm you ever wanted to
[25:34] see. And I thought, I got to ride out of
[25:37] here alone with a horse that I don't
[25:40] really know. Is he going to make his way
[25:42] out? And I got to leave Brother
[25:44] Brandham. And and and I had I had two
[25:48] real heavy things weighing on my heart.
[25:52] They were just crushing and I'd wanted
[25:54] to talk to him and never got the chance.
[25:58] And uh
[26:00] so they were all having their you know
[26:03] fun time and joshing around in the cook
[26:06] tent after breakfast and I was out there
[26:09] in that little tent rolling up my
[26:11] sleeping bag and I was just rolling it
[26:14] up and and was I feeling low? I don't
[26:17] know if you can get any lower.
[26:20] And here come brother Brandham with the
[26:22] flaps open and he come crawling in on
[26:24] his hands and knees and sat with his
[26:27] cross legs crossed and just squatted.
[26:30] He said, "Well, Brother Eddie, sure hate
[26:33] to see you go." Well, you know what I
[26:35] did? I just I bit my lip because I
[26:37] didn't want to cry in front of him. I
[26:40] said, "Yeah, brother Brandon, I sure
[26:42] hate to go, too."
[26:45] But he said, "I I know I know what it's
[26:48] like. you know, you're got a family and
[26:51] you got to go to work and got those
[26:53] responsibilities. And I was just
[26:56] acknowledging, yeah, and I just kept
[26:57] rolling up my sleeping bag. And
[27:00] he said, and u
[27:03] he said, uh, I I know all about the
[27:05] church in Dawson Creek and about your
[27:08] sister.
[27:10] And he just took those two things right
[27:12] out of my heart like that. And guess
[27:16] what the next thing was? My horse found
[27:18] his way out. So,
[27:20] so that that just, you know, two lines
[27:24] and maybe you think this morning, oh, we
[27:27] need some big, you know, shocking answer
[27:29] from above. No, we just need God to
[27:32] speak a couple of lines to us and we
[27:35] don't know. Might be in a song and might
[27:37] be in a testimony. It might be in
[27:39] whatever more. But we're so happy uh
[27:43] brother Cochman, you and your wife and
[27:46] and uh
[27:49] I don't I know he's the youngest. I know
[27:50] he's the tallest and his wife is there
[27:52] with him. God bless you. And Carolyn at
[27:55] sang. I really appreciate that. I want
[27:59] to just say brother Jake Dick just
[28:02] arrived. Where's brother Jake? Is he
[28:05] here this morning? just arrived back
[28:08] from Mexico
[28:09] and uh took some print uh print stations
[28:12] down. Was there more than one, Brother
[28:14] Cam? No, two. Two. And I just got an
[28:18] email this morning from Singapore.
[28:22] And the people that, you know, they just
[28:24] they hear about a need and they just
[28:26] want to respond. And they heard about
[28:28] Vietnam and they sent a print station
[28:31] over there. and uh and and now brother
[28:34] uh brother brother Timothy he's over
[28:37] there and they had a burden they sent
[28:39] another one over there then they emailed
[28:41] this morning said we want to send one to
[28:43] Africa we hear there's a need for them
[28:45] in Africa brother Kim was telling me
[28:48] this last week there's over 100 print
[28:52] stations already out and operating in
[28:55] the different countries and when you
[28:57] start to think that each one of them the
[28:59] formula is that each one of them can
[29:01] actually provide for about 10 smaller
[29:04] groups. You start talking about a
[29:06] thousand churches
[29:09] and they have the ability to have their
[29:11] books right on demand. You can
[29:14] understand why some of these people are
[29:16] burning them up. They're just burning
[29:18] them up. And it's wonderful to have a
[29:20] vision. I I really I really fear if we
[29:23] lose our vision. We sing the song uh
[29:27] don't lose your vision of Jesus. Well,
[29:28] who is Jesus? Jesus is the revealed
[29:31] word.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; And I got thinking, you know, I've heard
[29:34] some sometimes some negative things
[29:37] about missions and missions people don't
[29:39] understand. Maybe they haven't been
[29:41] there. Uh and and uh we were just doing
[29:44] a little bit of a a summary what's
[29:48] what's taking place because things are
[29:49] changing rapidly in some certain
[29:51] countries like in Africa and also in
[29:53] India, especially in India. And brother
[29:56] Kim was telling me there's been I think
[29:58] what is it 12 million 12 million message
[30:01] books that have been printed there. And
[30:04] I just thought of the people who've read
[30:06] and the people who have you know just
[30:09] it's been quickened to them. Who are
[30:11] they looking at?
[30:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the one that's making himself
[30:16] known. And so I just want to say that
[30:19] also want to let the church and all
[30:20] those that are streaming, we certainly
[30:23] welcome them in the congregation as
[30:26] well. And uh uh they uh uh they're
[30:31] they're planning on having a dedication
[30:33] for the church that we've been helping
[30:35] them with in Moscow. And uh and the Lord
[30:39] has uh just really burdened our hearts.
[30:42] So, they're sending, I think, $32,000
[30:46] US uh this next week to to Moscow so
[30:51] they can finish it and be in by the
[30:53] winter. And uh so I thank God for that
[30:56] and all those that are have contributed
[30:59] and so on. Then yesterday, just amazing,
[31:03] you know, it takes me a few minutes to
[31:05] get through this. Just yesterday,
[31:07] Brother Milo says he got a phone call
[31:09] from Serbia and some doors have opened
[31:12] in Macedonia
[31:14] and uh they they they're calling and I
[31:18] got thinking of the of the scripture
[31:22] uh and there stood a man
[31:26] before Paul. There stood a man of
[31:30] Macedonia
[31:31] saying, "Come over
[31:34] &gt;&gt; into Macedonia and help us."
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; And a man in Macedonia
[31:44] now again in our time
[31:46] &gt;&gt; has called our brothers in Serbia and
[31:49] have said, "Come over and help us."
[31:53] Hallelujah. And you know what? We're
[31:55] going to do what Paul did. Hallelujah.
[31:57] The brothers are going to go. They're
[31:59] going to go as soon as they can. And I
[32:02] can assure you there are people over
[32:04] there that are waiting to hear it.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we'll do anything that we can
[32:08] to see that they get it.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Murphy comes I hope this next
[32:13] week, isn't it? Sister Tracy, are you
[32:15] happy?
[32:17] And we're going to be so anxious to hear
[32:19] from Brother Murphy after a couple of
[32:21] months in China. My my I hope we can
[32:24] absorb all of these things and and it's
[32:27] just uh just wonderful. Well, now I'll
[32:31] have you stand if you would and I'm
[32:33] going to read a couple of scriptures.
[32:37] Uh maybe just before we read, I'd like
[32:40] to sing uh that I found a love that
[32:44] pardons.
[32:49] said I found a love and pardon.
[32:57] Oh, said I found some stripes that he
[33:03] [Applause]
[33:05] said I found strength for my weakness.
[33:11] My weakness I found grace to cover all
[33:17] my sins.
[33:20] Oh, it's in Jesus.
[33:25] Holy Jesus.
[33:28] Oh, it's in Jesus.
[33:31] He's the one. Holy one is our salvation.
[33:39] He's a firm foundation.
[33:44] It's in Jesus.
[33:48] the Lord. It's in Jesus.
[33:52] It's in Jesus.
[33:56] Only Jesus.
[33:59] It's in Jesus.
[34:02] He's Jesus.
[34:05] Let's give him all the glory. He's the
[34:07] rock sal.
[34:10] He's the perfect foundation.
[34:15] It's in Jesus.
[34:18] He's the one.
[34:23] Hallelujah.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of all of our praise. Well,
[34:26] God bless you. As you take your Bibles,
[34:30] we're going to turn to two scriptures.
[34:32] Hebrews the 9th chapter,
[34:35] the 28th verse. And I'm also going to
[34:38] read from Daniel the 12th chapter and
[34:41] the 4th verse.
[34:44] appreciate you all having your Bibles
[34:46] and being able to read and follow along.
[34:49] I have quite a number of uh of also some
[34:53] PowerPoint text because we're going to
[34:56] be going uh through subject that I would
[35:00] like to
[35:02] make it as clear as possible. There'll
[35:04] be a lot of food for thought uh this
[35:07] morning. I trust and trust you all have
[35:09] your spiritual mental caps on.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; All right.
[35:17] Just before we read, we'll pray.
[35:21] We're approaching you, Father.
[35:24] Because your spirit is the author of
[35:26] this word.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; You're the only one that can interpret
[35:30] it.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; You're the only one that can really
[35:34] reveal it and make it known to us. And
[35:37] so we pray that each individual person
[35:40] will grasp those eternal words that are
[35:43] passing through this building at this
[35:45] moment. I pray that you will anoint my
[35:48] lips, oh God, with a fresh fire
[35:53] uh from off the altar of God and that
[35:56] you will anoint the hearing of the
[35:58] people. Cause our vision, Lord, and our
[36:01] sight to see what your will is. Bless
[36:06] your people now, Lord, in this entire
[36:08] day. Thinking of those that are going to
[36:10] be baptized tonight. Oh, Holy Spirit. I
[36:15] know you will not fail them. You will
[36:18] fill them. This is your promise uh to be
[36:21] repent and be baptized in the name of
[36:23] the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
[36:26] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. And
[36:29] then may that be their portion. Now we
[36:31] thank you, Father. Father, we commit
[36:32] this day to you in Jesus lovely, lovely
[36:35] name. Amen.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:39] I want to read the 28th verse of Hebrews
[36:41] 9 first. So Christ was once offered to
[36:46] bear the sins of many. And unto them
[36:50] that look for him shall he appear the
[36:53] second time without sin unto salvation.
[36:58] While you're looking at that verse, I I
[37:01] would like to uh just divide these
[37:04] sentences. Unto them
[37:08] unto them
[37:11] that look for him,
[37:14] whoever he is, who are they looking for?
[37:16] Someone to come out of the skies or uh
[37:22] where are they looking and what are they
[37:23] looking for?
[37:26] Uh,
[37:28] Brother Brham said, "This is the symbol
[37:30] of God."
[37:33] This book right here, that's a that's
[37:36] God on printed page. And then when he
[37:39] reveals it, that's God living.
[37:44] And so unto them
[37:46] that look for him
[37:49] shall he appear the second time.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Without sin unto salvation.
[37:57] And then in Daniel the 12th chapter
[37:59] verse 4,
[38:01] God spoke to his prophet Daniel said,
[38:03] "But thou, oh Daniel, shut up the words
[38:06] and seal the book even to the time of
[38:10] the end." Many shall run to and fro and
[38:15] knowledge shall be increased. Amen. You
[38:18] may have your seats.
[38:22] We are most certainly living in a time
[38:25] of
[38:26] incredible
[38:28] expansion. And I I got thinking, how am
[38:31] I going to describe this?
[38:34] I thought, well, this is a knowledge
[38:36] explosion that's happening.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; And I thought that's something. Yeah. I
[38:41] thought about that phrase, this
[38:43] knowledge explosion.
[38:45] And so I just, you know, I just Googled
[38:47] it. I thought, well, somebody else has
[38:49] obviously, you know, thought of that
[38:51] phrase that's not that unique. And it it
[38:54] came up all over the place. All kinds of
[38:56] people have used those exact words. And
[39:00] uh it was really quite interesting,
[39:02] quite amazing. One one said that uh in
[39:05] the future things are moving at such a
[39:07] rapid pace that in the future everyone
[39:11] would have fame for 15 minutes.
[39:16] That's how fast things are going to are
[39:18] going. That's a direction.
[39:21] uh and and some other studies and these
[39:23] are these are in-depth studies uh from
[39:27] so-called very knowledgeable people and
[39:30] uh they are saying that because of the
[39:33] media and the way that things are
[39:35] presented at this time and with such a
[39:38] fast increased speed and while I say
[39:41] that remember brother Brandham speaking
[39:43] about the fulfillment of the seven
[39:45] visions which he had and five of them
[39:47] already fulfilled and he was predicting
[39:49] the ushering ing in of the millennium.
[39:52] He said, I predict I do not prophesy was
[39:54] in the church ages. I predict that the
[39:57] that the uh the ushering in of the
[40:00] millennium, he said, by 1977.
[40:03] Well, if you if you take the word, I
[40:05] don't want to get onto this, but you
[40:06] talk about ushering in. The bride is
[40:08] being ushered in. Well, where is she? Is
[40:10] she just uh coming out of the car? Is
[40:13] she in the parking lot? Is she just
[40:16] entering into the foyer? Where is the
[40:18] bride being ushered in? And so the whole
[40:21] word and concept of ushering is that
[40:24] there's a there's a a movement there
[40:26] that things have been set into place.
[40:30] They're set into motion. And I believe
[40:32] exactly what he said, but he made a very
[40:35] interesting comment and that was that uh
[40:38] because of the rapid pace and speed and
[40:42] with which things were happening, he
[40:44] made the prediction on that basis. And
[40:47] so now he's tying two things together.
[40:49] Not only the vision but the speed by
[40:51] which things are unfolding. And we are
[40:54] certainly in that time.
[40:56] Amen. And uh and and this one uh people
[41:00] uh uh this one uh fac uh university that
[41:03] was studying these things was saying
[41:05] that it is happening with such speed and
[41:08] and so all the data and the knowledge is
[41:11] coming in one direction and then the uh
[41:15] enabling each individual and even
[41:18] children to both visually and uh use the
[41:22] technology to to send and to connect and
[41:26] the connection of the world. They said
[41:27] it's actually going to change the whole
[41:29] face of civilization
[41:32] and it is changing it. We're actually in
[41:34] it right now. And uh and and so uh we
[41:37] certainly are in that time when
[41:40] knowledge shall be increased. It's also
[41:45] called because of this and the uh whole
[41:48] globe becoming merely a village. It's
[41:51] it's said it's an age of tolerance and
[41:54] and that has its good side and has its
[41:57] bad side. Uh the age of tolerance uh we
[42:01] have even here in the church in
[42:03] Vancouver itself and many many cities
[42:06] have become multicultural cities and whe
[42:09] that's wonderful. We really think that
[42:11] that is a wonderful aspect and that's
[42:13] going to continue and that's going to
[42:16] increase because of the connectivity of
[42:18] the peoples of the world. So there's
[42:21] ethnic groups and there's age groups and
[42:23] there's geographical regions and there
[42:26] are religious beliefs. But then that's
[42:28] where we have to start to be careful
[42:30] about tolerance about religious beliefs
[42:33] because all kinds of things are being
[42:35] done. Uh in fact there's a on the news
[42:38] last night just driving home from uh the
[42:42] uh musical presentation out in
[42:45] Abbottzford. They said there's been 300
[42:48] people, I guess this year, just in
[42:50] Afghanistan or in Iraq, 300 people have
[42:54] been killed by suicide bombers. And but
[42:58] that's all in the name of religion. I
[43:00] personally don't believe that religion.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that God is the author
[43:05] of that kind of thing. And so the
[43:08] acceptance of of of uh religious beliefs
[43:11] and the acceptance of sexual orientation
[43:14] and that's where we start ending our
[43:16] broadmindedness
[43:19] &gt;&gt; and the openness and the tolerance and
[43:21] the acceptance but also it also is uh
[43:26] gives way to patience and charity and
[43:30] the ability to endure hardships or to
[43:33] put up with harsh or diff difficult uh
[43:36] uh conditions. We have all of that that
[43:39] that comes in this uh in in this
[43:42] particular age that we're in. But we're
[43:44] in a time or season,
[43:48] and now we're going to take a real swift
[43:49] turn. We're in a time or season that is
[43:53] actually between, now we're going right
[43:55] into the depths of the message right at
[43:58] the beginning, between the feast of the
[44:00] trumpets
[44:02] and the seventh seal.
[44:05] And that's why you'll need to really
[44:07] keep your thinking caps on. And when I
[44:10] refer to the trumpets and when you hear
[44:15] the word trumpets,
[44:17] I want you to think of voice.
[44:20] When you hear the word of thunders or
[44:22] seven thunders, I want you just to think
[44:25] of voice. And when you hear the phrase
[44:29] third pull, I want you to think of
[44:32] voice. a voice. And when I speak of a
[44:36] messenger, then I want you to think of a
[44:39] voice.
[44:41] And we're going to take a certain a
[44:43] certain perspective which I think is
[44:47] very very important and something that
[44:49] you'll ponder on long after this
[44:51] service. So when I say trumpets, you
[44:54] think of voice, thunders, you think of
[44:57] voice, messenger, you think of voice.
[45:01] And when we think of the third pull, you
[45:05] think of voice because that's where it
[45:08] all focuses down. And this is we're
[45:10] living in an in between time. Now, as
[45:14] brother John Andy's was preaching on
[45:16] Wednesday, and I just would remind you
[45:18] one thing. He said sometimes there are
[45:20] events and times and periods in our life
[45:22] that are progressive
[45:26] and then God can deal with us in a very
[45:29] quick in a very short intense way in a
[45:34] moment of time and that is true. Now,
[45:37] now we've been in the age we say Luke
[45:41] 17:30 a day when the son of man will be
[45:44] revealed. Well, uh, a lot of a lot has
[45:48] happened and I'll be coming into
[45:50] specific details, but, uh, Christ was
[45:54] Christ was put out of the church.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Well, that's already happened. The
[45:58] word's already been put out. So, that's
[46:00] history.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; So, we're way beyond that. A and a bride
[46:05] would be called out. That's already
[46:07] happened. So, that's all in this period
[46:10] of time. So, we have progressed all
[46:12] through that. So we can say that has
[46:14] taken place. The bride has been called
[46:16] out. She has been identified and all
[46:19] these various things that are to take
[46:22] place. And I'll be touching just on some
[46:24] of them just to keep you focused that
[46:27] this is a now we've zeroed in. We're
[46:30] we're down into a vortex in a very very
[46:33] short period of time. And uh and we will
[46:37] not know. I I want to be honest with
[46:39] you. I do not believe any one of us will
[46:41] know everything that is happening
[46:44] because it'll be happening so quickly.
[46:47] We have been watching Israel. Israel to
[46:50] become a nation that's already happened
[46:53] but that had to happen in this era in
[46:55] this time and and Israel is God's time
[46:59] piece and we do watch that but none of
[47:03] us here understand all of the events
[47:06] that are happening there. Sometimes a
[47:08] certain thing happens, we say, "Yay,
[47:10] yeah, that's supposed to because we see
[47:12] it. It agrees with us and agrees with
[47:15] what we understand the message to say."
[47:18] And then the next time you say, "Oh my
[47:19] goodness, what's happening now?" It all
[47:21] seems to be going in reverse. You know,
[47:23] they seem to be advancing towards uh uh
[47:25] the fulfillment of the scripture. Then
[47:27] it seems to be going backwards. But even
[47:30] when you and I think it's going
[47:31] backwards, there's still God's time
[47:33] piece. It's just that we're not reading
[47:35] it exactly right. But I want you to know
[47:38] and to keep keep focused on this that it
[47:41] is moving in the direction that it's
[47:43] supposed to go and nothing is out of the
[47:46] plan of God.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; So, we're at this in between time
[47:53] between the feast of the trumpets. Now,
[47:56] you won't have time if you want to jot
[47:58] it down or or or or just make a note,
[48:01] but the seven feasts the seven feasts
[48:04] and they're all Christ. And so don't get
[48:07] lost in this. There are seven feasts in
[48:09] Leviticus the 23rd chapter. And I'm only
[48:12] going to mention uh maybe three or four
[48:15] of these feasts because it it it it's
[48:17] necessary for the uh message today. But
[48:21] the the feast of the trumpets, which
[48:23] brother Brandham preach pre preached the
[48:25] feast of the trumpets. He did not preach
[48:28] the feast of the tabernacles. He did not
[48:31] preach like the feast of Pentecost. He
[48:33] did place them. But in the the feast of
[48:36] trumpets, he preached that after the
[48:38] seals. And then but between the feast of
[48:42] the trumpets and the tabernacles because
[48:46] tabernacles,
[48:48] let me let me just give you very quickly
[48:51] so you can connect with my thought which
[48:54] I believe the Holy Spirit has been
[48:56] dealing with me about for some time.
[48:59] God,
[49:00] no one knew really what God was like.
[49:02] You know, God was a pillar of fire and a
[49:06] burning bush and a burning mountain on
[49:08] Mount Si. And God was a fearsome God of
[49:11] judgment and came down with the
[49:13] commandments which none of the people
[49:14] could keep. And so their concept and
[49:17] understanding of God, but God, there was
[49:19] really no change of tabernacle
[49:23] until God came and tabernacled in a body
[49:28] of flesh called Jesus Christ.
[49:32] That was a feast.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; And that is why Jesus said, "Unless you
[49:37] eat my flesh,
[49:39] &gt;&gt; unless you eat this mana, unless you eat
[49:42] this bread and drink this blood, there
[49:45] is no life in you." In other words, this
[49:47] is God's feast
[49:49] &gt;&gt; of tabernacles.
[49:51] But he didn't come just to be a single
[49:53] individual, a second Adam. He was going
[49:56] to come and tabernacle in a body of
[49:59] people. and the conclusion and the
[50:02] ultimate of that uh feast of
[50:04] tabernacles. We're going to have a feast
[50:07] in another body.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; And now we have a prophet in this end
[50:11] time. We didn't know this before. You
[50:13] never heard anyone else preach it
[50:15] before, but telling us that you you have
[50:17] a word body, you have a thought,
[50:19] theophony right next to you.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; And you know that today only because he
[50:25] said it.
[50:26] It's important that you recognize, and
[50:30] this is where I'm going to be coming to
[50:31] further in the message, we need to look
[50:34] at what has been spoken
[50:36] &gt;&gt; and hold our focus on what has been
[50:39] spoken, not on how we feel or how we
[50:42] think things are going or what we see
[50:44] taking place, but we need to see what he
[50:48] was looking at. And that's going to be
[50:50] my theme today. We need to see what
[50:53] brother Brandham was looking at, what
[50:55] God had focused him on and then he spoke
[50:58] it so that we could look at it.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; So the feast of trumpets comes between
[51:06] uh between the feast of trumpets
[51:09] and between the tabernacles. Now the
[51:12] feast of trumpets
[51:14] is between between Pentecost because now
[51:18] we have this age of grace, this long
[51:21] period of Pentecost
[51:23] and the day of atonement. And the day of
[51:26] atonement is when when the Jews will
[51:30] recognize him. The day of the age of
[51:33] grace is when the Gentiles recognize
[51:36] him. And then comes the day of but then
[51:40] comes the feast of trumpets. And the
[51:42] trumpets is a voice. The trumpets can be
[51:44] uh not a preaching necessarily. It's it
[51:47] is something that speaks to the people
[51:49] and draws them back. The people have
[51:52] always been drawn by trumpets in Israel.
[51:56] You'll be called and you'll do this and
[51:58] you'll have a trumpet for war and you'll
[52:00] have a trumpet for Jubilee and you'll
[52:02] have a trumpet. That's why Apostle Paul
[52:04] said, "If it gives an uncertain sound,
[52:07] how will they know what to do?" But it
[52:09] has to give a certain sound. And so
[52:11] there were people even before the Second
[52:13] World War, I've met them. Not many, just
[52:16] one here, one there. But they were they
[52:18] they they were felt something within
[52:20] them, moving within them. And they left
[52:23] and were called back to go back to
[52:25] Israel. old men, people who had a
[52:29] promise of their family business, they
[52:32] gave it all up. Said, "I have to go back
[52:34] to Israel." What was it? There was a
[52:36] voice, an inner voice calling them back
[52:39] to the homeland because the prophet said
[52:42] that God cannot bless them outside of
[52:45] the homeland. So, it's a voice of
[52:47] Almighty God calling them back for the
[52:49] blessing.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:54] And so between the when we say
[52:56] Pentecost, that's the that's the time of
[52:59] the gentile calling.
[53:02] And then between that and the day of
[53:04] atonement or the feast of atonement.
[53:06] Between those comes the trumpets. And so
[53:09] the prophet now he's the end time
[53:12] messenger of the Gentiles. At the end of
[53:15] the gentile age, which is the feast of
[53:17] Pentecost, and at the end he preaches
[53:20] the seals. and on on on and unveils
[53:24] Christ in in that way comes to the
[53:27] seventh seal speaking of the coming of
[53:30] Christ and then preaches the feast of
[53:32] the trumpets because he's announcing
[53:36] that Israel will be gathered. They're
[53:39] over there now. And how many times he
[53:41] said they're over there now their flag
[53:43] is flying. They've got their own money.
[53:45] They have their own nation. Everything
[53:47] else they've been gathered back what
[53:49] for? for the atonement because that's
[53:51] the next feast and after that is the
[53:54] feast of tabernacles and the change of
[53:57] the body and that's the last
[54:02] &gt;&gt; so we have in this feast we have the we
[54:05] have the feast of first fruits which was
[54:07] the resurrection the first fruits Jesus
[54:11] was the first fruits of the resurrection
[54:14] and when they and and he said when you
[54:15] come into the land and you receive your
[54:18] first fruits See, they had to actually
[54:20] live out the these feasts. So when you
[54:23] come into the land and you plant your
[54:25] field and the first the first ripe
[54:29] grain, the first grain that turns ripe,
[54:33] you'll cut it down. They were actually
[54:36] fulfilling the scripture because Jesus
[54:38] was the first one that would come and be
[54:41] actually God in flesh. He was the first
[54:44] ripe one.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; He was the first mature one. And and
[54:48] here God is spelling it out and showing
[54:50] in such beautiful detail. You'll cut
[54:53] that one down and you'll bring it. And
[54:55] notice, please, I can't go into it.
[54:57] There's just so much. But you'll take
[54:59] that bundle and you'll bring it to the
[55:01] priest. Not the prophet. To the priest.
[55:04] Because when Jesus was here on earth, he
[55:07] was a son of man prophet.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Then he died, shed his blood, and rose.
[55:15] And as he rose, ascended with his blood,
[55:18] and went into the holy of holies, that
[55:20] was the priest's office.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; So that's why he was son of God. He was
[55:25] son of man, fulfilling the promise on
[55:28] earth. Then he he took the place of son
[55:31] of God. And that's why John the Baptist,
[55:34] the spirit of Elijah, announced him as
[55:36] the lamb of God because it was not the
[55:39] prophet that went into the holy of
[55:41] holies. It was the priest that went into
[55:43] the holy of holies. So now he had to
[55:45] enter into the priest's office. And in
[55:47] the priest's office, the scripture says
[55:49] he entered in once
[55:52] &gt;&gt; with his own blood
[55:54] &gt;&gt; for you sitting here today.
[55:57] Hallelujah. The atonement is there
[56:00] &gt;&gt; by the pure spotless blood and Jesus
[56:03] entered into his priesthood. And that is
[56:06] why the prophet, the messenger in the
[56:08] end time, the spirit of Elijah once
[56:10] again Elijah announced him, "Behold the
[56:12] lamb of God." And then at the end here
[56:15] comes the the um uh Elijah for the for
[56:19] the Gentiles and he preaches who is this
[56:22] MelzDC? MelzDC wasn't prophet now he's a
[56:26] priest. He said who is this Melzdc? This
[56:29] priest
[56:30] &gt;&gt; that that has no beginning of days and
[56:33] no end of life.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; He's the same one that met met Abraham
[56:38] back there. And when he made Abraham, he
[56:41] made him as prophet, priest. Abraham was
[56:44] prophet and he came in the office of
[56:46] priest and king.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because to us, he he had to
[56:51] end this church age and come with this
[56:54] last messenger and reveal himself.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Every time brother says, "Oh, that
[57:01] pillar of fire is moving. It's moving.
[57:02] Oh, there it is over that man there." He
[57:05] said, "Who did he touch?"
[57:07] &gt;&gt; He didn't say the prophet. He's always
[57:09] said the high priest.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; He touched the high priest
[57:15] &gt;&gt; always.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful friends?
[57:19] &gt;&gt; This is a feast.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; And we came to another feast at the end
[57:23] of this Pentecostal era.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; And then when he when he raised when
[57:28] Jesus was cut down, he was the first
[57:31] mature grain. And the bi and the Bible
[57:34] tells us that he he raised and he
[57:37] ascended with his own blood. And the
[57:40] prophet now comes in this time. How
[57:42] beautiful it was. He ties those two
[57:44] together. And he says, "And he was waved
[57:47] over the people, blessing them as he
[57:51] departed to go into the Holy of Holies."
[57:54] Hallelujah. And he's waved over the
[57:57] people. Oh, how thankful I am for the
[57:59] interpretation of the message by a
[58:01] prophet messenger. And he said, why was
[58:04] he being waved over the people? It was a
[58:06] memorial to God that there's more like
[58:09] him in the field.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; You were still in the field. You young
[58:15] people, the bodies you sit in was in the
[58:17] earth.
[58:19] When Jesus was waved over the people,
[58:23] &gt;&gt; every one of us here, our bodies, which
[58:25] is just part of the uh chemistry of the
[58:28] earth, this flesh was laying here. And
[58:31] God almighty took the accepted sacrifice
[58:36] and waved it over you.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; He waved it over you as a memorial.
[58:45] There's more like this son
[58:48] &gt;&gt; in whom I'm well pleased.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; And that's why Paul said, "You're
[58:52] accepted in the beloved."
[58:55] &gt;&gt; You're already accepted back there when
[58:57] your bodies hadn't even been conceived
[58:59] yet.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; I say, "Glory be to God."
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to be accepted in the
[59:06] beloved?
[59:07] &gt;&gt; And that was all laid back laid in the
[59:10] in the in the scriptures back in
[59:11] Leviticus already.
[59:14] I just have to hold myself back because
[59:16] there's just so much. I have to watch my
[59:19] time, too. Incidentally, your dinner
[59:21] with brother and sister Cochman, the
[59:23] Cochman family, I was told, is at 1:30.
[59:26] So, we don't be nervous.
[59:32] And then,
[59:34] and then after the first sheath was
[59:36] waved, then they had 50 days later, they
[59:40] have Pentecost.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Pentecost. And at Pentecost there's a
[59:44] waving of a loaf
[59:47] &gt;&gt; and he was the loaf
[59:49] &gt;&gt; and there was waving and that loaf was
[59:51] to have no leaven in it.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; None
[59:55] &gt;&gt; because there was no leaven in him. But
[59:57] then they had two loaves and they waved
[1:00:00] these two because it was representing
[1:00:02] the church and they had leaven in them
[1:00:05] and it showed that there would be you
[1:00:08] know we have the cornality and we all
[1:00:10] have our problems and that would be with
[1:00:13] us through to the end
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; and so we weren't exclusive of of levan
[1:00:19] we had and and so it showed it even back
[1:00:22] there that there'd be leaven but they
[1:00:23] would be also waved before God. Amen.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; And then we had the uh feast of
[1:00:30] Pentecost. I say the wave of the loaves.
[1:00:33] And then the the prophet said during in
[1:00:35] the message the feast of the trumpets,
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; he said and he called the gentile church
[1:00:41] out through this Pentecostal feast. And
[1:00:45] we know that. And then we have the after
[1:00:48] that we said the feast of trumpets and
[1:00:50] the day of atonement
[1:00:52] in the message. Once again, please just
[1:00:54] hold this closely in your mind. In the
[1:00:57] message, feast of the trumpets, uh,
[1:00:59] paragraph 38, he said, "And they said,
[1:01:03] oh my," because the trumpets all refer
[1:01:05] to Israel, not to the prophet. The
[1:01:08] reason why you say, "Well, why would
[1:01:09] brother Brandham cover that then?"
[1:01:12] because we need to know where we're at
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; and what is taking place and because
[1:01:19] some of these things are kind of o being
[1:01:21] overlap overlapping. So he said, "And
[1:01:24] they will say, "Oh my, did we actually
[1:01:27] miss seeing him?"
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Uh, "Was that the atonement
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; and we've missed?"
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. He said, "And they said they
[1:01:36] just separate themselves," speaking of
[1:01:38] the Jews, "and mourned for days." He
[1:01:40] said, "What is it?" He said, "It's the
[1:01:43] atonement,
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; the sadness." This time he said
[1:01:48] this time the coming of the or making
[1:01:51] known the atonement notice this closely
[1:01:54] is not the regular atonement being
[1:01:56] killed
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; because they had a they had an atonement
[1:02:00] in the scripture which atoned for their
[1:02:03] sins
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; but he said in Leviticus this is not the
[1:02:07] regular atonement being killed like in
[1:02:10] Leviticus 16. So they had an atonement
[1:02:14] there. But he says Leviticus 23 is a
[1:02:17] morning time for of their sins of their
[1:02:21] sins that their sins was they rejected
[1:02:25] it. It was a morning time that they had
[1:02:27] missed they had missed the atonement
[1:02:30] because they are recognizing Christ. He
[1:02:33] goes on to say the Pentecostal feast is
[1:02:36] paragraph 36. Actually I'm going back.
[1:02:38] The par the Pentecostal feast finishes
[1:02:42] at the period of the seventh trumpet.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; And he says, "For the next is the coming
[1:02:47] or or the seventh seal for the next is
[1:02:50] the mystery of the coming of Christ."
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; And also the trumpet is to sound for the
[1:02:55] Jews.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; So now there's a calling of the Jews. So
[1:02:59] there's something that's happening at
[1:03:00] the same time.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; And this is what I'm I'm going into. So
[1:03:04] we have a trumpet sounding for the Jews
[1:03:07] and the seventh seal next is the mystery
[1:03:09] of the coming of Christ. So it's not
[1:03:11] just the coming of Christ, the mystery
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; of the coming of Christ. Are you with
[1:03:16] me?
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; He says their sixth trumpet is sound and
[1:03:20] when it does it makes known to them the
[1:03:22] revealed son of God.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; He said one half hour is fixed. Remember
[1:03:29] all trumpets sound on the sixth seal. So
[1:03:32] on the sixth seal, all the trumpets
[1:03:34] sound because that's a tribulation seal.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; The sixth seal finishes the mystery
[1:03:41] under the sixth seal just before the
[1:03:43] seventh is opened.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; He said Leviticus 23 and 26. How in
[1:03:49] order is the scripture after the long
[1:03:52] period of Pentecost, he said which
[1:03:54] Israel did reject back there. They
[1:03:57] rejected it. Are you with me?
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Okay. They rejected him. They rejected
[1:04:02] Pentecost. That's what Paul was busy
[1:04:05] doing, throwing them in prison and all
[1:04:07] the rest of it. So, the Jews had
[1:04:09] rejected it. He says, "And he called the
[1:04:11] Gentile church out through the
[1:04:14] Pentecostal feast." So, now we've got
[1:04:16] the Pentecostal feast and he's called
[1:04:19] the Gentiles out during that time. Now
[1:04:22] if you're reading the feast of the
[1:04:24] trumpets and many of you have
[1:04:27] there's brother Bradom like gets in a
[1:04:29] confusion there and he but he does
[1:04:31] settle it in questions and answers 1964
[1:04:36] uh in 9 965-204.
[1:04:39] I'm only giving that for you for your
[1:04:41] reference there. But he said like the
[1:04:43] other day he said I got something mixed
[1:04:45] up. I happened to hear it and he says,
[1:04:48] "I caught it right there and it's on the
[1:04:51] tape and I'll probably hear from it."
[1:04:53] When I was talking about the seven
[1:04:55] trumpets, I said it was seven trumpets.
[1:04:57] I was referring to the Pentecostal
[1:04:59] feast. From the Pentecostal feast until
[1:05:02] the trumpets, there was seven Sabbaths.
[1:05:05] He said seven Sabbaths was between the
[1:05:07] feast of Passover to Pentecost, which
[1:05:10] made the 50 days. So, he corrected. If
[1:05:13] you're in there and you say, "Well, I I
[1:05:15] can't make this match up." I just
[1:05:17] dropped that in to let you know that's
[1:05:18] why you can't make it match up because
[1:05:20] he he said it he got he got mixed up
[1:05:23] himself and but he answers it in
[1:05:24] questions and answers. The 50 days was
[1:05:27] between the resurrection and Pentecost
[1:05:30] and then the long period which didn't
[1:05:32] have any specific time identified which
[1:05:35] was the feast of Pentecost.
[1:05:38] But then he comes and I want to come to
[1:05:41] this seventh seal mystery.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal mystery or the coming
[1:05:48] of Christ. He said in the first seal and
[1:05:50] this is in the first seal. He said his
[1:05:53] coming. He said nobody's going to know
[1:05:56] when I'm coming. I'm just coming.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; That's all. It isn't for It isn't for my
[1:06:03] business, speaking of himself to know
[1:06:05] when. I'll just be ready.
[1:06:07] That's that's the main thing. Then he
[1:06:10] said, "If Satan could get a hold of it,
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; he can do a lot of damage."
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; And he goes into that quote. He says, "I
[1:06:16] know better than to tell people you know
[1:06:18] what I'm going to do cuz when I do," he
[1:06:20] says, "Once you speak it, Satan hears
[1:06:22] it." And then he caused all kinds of
[1:06:24] trouble with it. So, so he said that
[1:06:28] he'll just keep it. He'll keep it quiet.
[1:06:30] He's trying to bring it down in our
[1:06:31] language. If Satan could get a hold of
[1:06:33] it, he said he could do a great damage.
[1:06:35] So in Revelation 8:1 it says, "And when
[1:06:38] he had opened the seventh seal, there
[1:06:40] was silence in heaven about the space of
[1:06:44] half an hour." And that's it. That's the
[1:06:46] whole seal.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; In the seventh seal, he said the
[1:06:49] breaking of this seal was so great
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; that heaven was hushed by it, hushed by
[1:06:56] it in silence for the space of half an
[1:06:58] hour.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "It is the secret that no one
[1:07:02] knows about." out. Now, just hold this
[1:07:04] if you feel that you know you're you're
[1:07:06] you're swimming and I'm going over your
[1:07:08] head or whatever more. Not really.
[1:07:10] There's a lot of a lot of material, a
[1:07:12] lot of quoting, and I'm doing a lot of
[1:07:14] reading, but I'm I I really worked hard
[1:07:20] to keep this in continuity.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; So, I So, now we've moved from the
[1:07:24] feast, we've come to the end of the
[1:07:27] gentile uh feast of Pentecost, and God
[1:07:30] sends a prophet messenger. Amen.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Messenger. What' I say? A voice
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; to speak certain things.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Not just for us to hear, but for you to
[1:07:40] look at.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; And God opened your eyes when you gave
[1:07:46] your life to Christ.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; And he opened your eyes for one specific
[1:07:50] purpose so you could keep looking
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; at the same thing.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Because that voice will never change.
[1:07:59] And God knows that conditions around you
[1:08:02] are going to change. Circumstances are
[1:08:04] going to change. The world is going to
[1:08:06] change. Your friend is going to change.
[1:08:09] But what he spoke is never going to
[1:08:11] change.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; So he wants you to keep looking at that
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; and everybody say amen.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; So he said it is the secret.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; That no one knows about
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; John. Now he identifies it. John was
[1:08:28] forbidden to write about it. That was
[1:08:30] there in the revelation even to write a
[1:08:33] symbol about it. That is why there's no
[1:08:36] activity in heaven.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; He said it might give it might give away
[1:08:41] the secret.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; And then in Matthew now it says there's
[1:08:45] one thing that Jesus identifies and one
[1:08:49] thing that Jesus said only God the
[1:08:52] father knew.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; And he said and he identified it. He
[1:08:56] said, "And of that day, an hour,"
[1:08:59] speaking of his coming, Matthew the 24th
[1:09:02] chapter, "and of that day and that hour
[1:09:07] knoweth no man, know not the angels of
[1:09:10] heaven, but the Father only."
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; He went on, Brother Brandham says, "If
[1:09:17] Satan could get a hold of it, he might
[1:09:19] do great damage. There's one thing he
[1:09:22] don't know. And now he can interpret
[1:09:25] anything he wants to and impersonate any
[1:09:28] kind of gift, but he can't know this.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? Something's been
[1:09:34] reserved for you.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; That even the devil doesn't know.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; And the reason he doesn't know, well,
[1:09:40] you say, "But it's in the message." But
[1:09:42] he doesn't believe the message.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; He's already refused it. Even his
[1:09:47] theologians refused it. So, there's one
[1:09:50] thing that the bride knows that no one
[1:09:53] else knows.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, I don't know how or
[1:09:58] exactly when." And so on so forth. You
[1:10:00] might not know specifics as much as you
[1:10:03] would like to know as the disciples did
[1:10:05] when Jesus was getting ready to leave.
[1:10:08] They said, "Are you going to restore the
[1:10:09] kingdom to Israel now?" He said, "No,
[1:10:11] that's not given for you to know."
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; So, they weren't they were but you shall
[1:10:17] receive power.
[1:10:19] And I say to you today, there are
[1:10:21] certain maybe specifics that we'd love
[1:10:24] to know, but you shall receive power.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; If God withholds it from you, you shall
[1:10:30] receive power.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; You will be sustained.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; You'll be here today
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; and you'll be in the rapture when that
[1:10:39] moment comes.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Just keep looking at exactly the right
[1:10:43] thing.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; All right. He said seven. Now he said he
[1:10:49] can interpret any interpret impersonate
[1:10:51] anything but he can't know this. Then
[1:10:53] brother Brandon goes right on to say
[1:10:55] seven thunders. And when I say seven
[1:10:58] thunders don't don't don't don't
[1:10:59] squiggle around or think I'm going in
[1:11:01] some direction. I'm telling you exactly
[1:11:03] what he said.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; He said seven thunders. And when I said
[1:11:06] thunders think of what?
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Voice. and seven thunders
[1:11:14] uttered straight together like they're
[1:11:17] spelling out something.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; They're trying to say something,
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; he said. But notice at that time, John
[1:11:25] started to write and he said, "Don't
[1:11:27] write it.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus never spoke it. John couldn't
[1:11:31] write it. Angels know nothing about it."
[1:11:34] What is it? It's the thing that Jesus
[1:11:36] said, even the angels of heaven didn't
[1:11:38] know nothing about it. He didn't know it
[1:11:41] himself. Only God would know it. But he
[1:11:44] but he told us when we begin to see
[1:11:47] these signs. When we begin to see these
[1:11:51] signs, look up,
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; these signs coming up, but at that day
[1:11:57] and hour knoweth no man. And Jesus said,
[1:12:00] "Not the angels which are in heaven."
[1:12:02] Mark 13:32, "Neither the Son, but the
[1:12:06] Father."
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the seventh seal again,
[1:12:09] paragraph 558, he said, "Satan will try
[1:12:12] to impersonate. He'll try to impersonate
[1:12:15] everything, but this one thing he cannot
[1:12:18] impersonate." He said, "There will be no
[1:12:20] mimics of this."
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, there's no mimics of
[1:12:24] this.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Because he doesn't know it and there's
[1:12:29] no way for him to know it. And then
[1:12:31] brother Brandham identifies it. It's the
[1:12:33] third pull. So now we have we have the
[1:12:37] thunders, we have the messenger, we have
[1:12:41] the third pull,
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; and we have the trumpets. And so we say
[1:12:45] trumpets voice,
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; messenger voice,
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; third pull voice,
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; thunders voice. They're all p all
[1:12:55] focused on the same thing.
[1:12:58] And that's why it had to be the last
[1:13:00] part of brother Bram's ministry.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; The first pull with a sign in the hand
[1:13:04] for the body. The second pull reveal the
[1:13:07] secret of your heart. But the third pull
[1:13:10] is the word. And that is the word that
[1:13:12] is empowered to transform us and change
[1:13:16] this creature into an immortal creature.
[1:13:20] [Applause]
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Do you accept that?
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:27] It's the third pull. He just knows
[1:13:30] nothing about it. He doesn't understand
[1:13:33] it.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Things that happen in this in between
[1:13:39] time and there's just so so much. You
[1:13:41] have to forgive me. I can't possibly
[1:13:43] begin to identify it. But in the feast
[1:13:45] of the trumpets, brother Brandham is
[1:13:47] speaking out of Isaiah 27 and 12 and 13.
[1:13:51] And there's a sound of a a great
[1:13:52] trumpet, which again is a voice. He
[1:13:54] says, "And he talks about Israel
[1:13:56] returning and at this end sign." You use
[1:13:59] the word end sign. And so I have number
[1:14:02] one, we're talking about things that are
[1:14:04] happening in this in between time.
[1:14:06] Number one, all the nations will
[1:14:08] recognize Israel. Israel's in her
[1:14:11] homeland.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; I guess they do.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; The United Nations is there. They all
[1:14:15] recognize it. Uh he said then the bride
[1:14:19] will come to be with the bridegroom
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; and the bridegroom with the bride.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; It's already happened friends.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; It's passed.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; And then the great millennium after the
[1:14:34] whole world is destroyed by atomic power
[1:14:37] and there will be a new heaven and a new
[1:14:39] earth shall live together.
[1:14:43] And notice he says the ministry of Moses
[1:14:46] and Elijah begin between the sixth and
[1:14:50] seventh trumpet will be two prophets. I
[1:14:53] say prophets or messenger. What it'll
[1:14:55] be? It'll be a voice.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; And it'll be one they hear.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; And he says Israel will always believe
[1:15:03] their prophets. Brother Brandham just
[1:15:05] stops and drops in there and some I
[1:15:07] think maybe got uh got turned around on
[1:15:10] a wee bit. He said, "You remember about
[1:15:12] 5 years ago on my way to India, he said
[1:15:15] uh he said don't do it." And they said,
[1:15:18] "If this is the Messiah, let us see him
[1:15:21] do the sign of the prophet and we
[1:15:23] believe the prophet." Brother Louie
[1:15:25] Petrus. Brother Louie Petrus was a
[1:15:27] pastor, I think, of the largest
[1:15:29] Pentecostal church in Stockholm, Sweden,
[1:15:31] one of the largest in the world. He had
[1:15:33] about 8,000 members at at that time. And
[1:15:36] he said, and brother Louie Petra sent
[1:15:39] them uh those Bibles. He said, a
[1:15:41] million, give them a million of them out
[1:15:44] to them Jews coming in from Iran and
[1:15:47] everywhere, coming back, assembling
[1:15:49] themselves together, becoming a nation.
[1:15:52] And I thought, this is my time.
[1:15:56] I was ready in Cairo, Egypt. And he
[1:15:59] said, don't do it now. The hour's not
[1:16:03] yet. Then I returned home. But the
[1:16:06] spirit of Elijah was in him was calling
[1:16:09] to go there.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; But Moses and Elijah will be those
[1:16:16] prophets that will go there and that's
[1:16:19] all part of the trumpets. But he had to
[1:16:21] speak that because it's part of our
[1:16:23] scene.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; It's part it's things we have to
[1:16:26] understand.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; It says Moses and Elijah Moses and
[1:16:34] Elijah's got to call the Pentecostal
[1:16:38] Jubilee still going or had up till this
[1:16:43] time.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Now he said the first feast of trumpets
[1:16:50] has to be known and this one over here
[1:16:53] in Malachi 4 is not connected with that
[1:16:56] one over there. Not at all. Not at all.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; So that individual, brother Brandham, is
[1:17:03] not the one that will go over there, but
[1:17:05] they'll believe the same message because
[1:17:07] it's going to be the same messenger. And
[1:17:09] what is the message? The message is
[1:17:11] Christ.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; And they will believe the same Christ.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; It will reveal Christ to them.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; But it'll be a mystery to us because we
[1:17:22] won't even be here during that time. And
[1:17:25] even if we were, we wouldn't know it any
[1:17:27] more than they know about William Brown.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; They don't know about him. Look, look
[1:17:32] what it is.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; He said, notice the ministry will be
[1:17:36] Moses and Elijah changing and calling
[1:17:40] Israel from the Jewish traditions that
[1:17:43] they had been mixed up in uh be being
[1:17:46] prophets, they'll believe him, calling
[1:17:49] them to the feast of the atonement.
[1:17:52] calling them to the feast of the
[1:17:54] atonement. That's where they're going to
[1:17:55] recognize it was him
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; that we crucified and they're going to
[1:17:59] mourn.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; And he says letting them recognize
[1:18:05] Christ and they'll say he's coming.
[1:18:07] He'll be here.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; The Jews will be gathering things like
[1:18:11] that and and then when he comes
[1:18:15] he comes say here I am. They say where
[1:18:18] do you get those scars? Now he says,
[1:18:21] "Now the same as those two prophets did,
[1:18:24] the same as those two prophets did,
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; remember the gentile bride is to have a
[1:18:30] prophet called Elias or Elijah. That's
[1:18:33] to call them out of their traditions.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful today?"
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; And those of you young people have been
[1:18:42] born in home. You've been born in a in a
[1:18:46] land or a home of liberty. Hallelujah.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Many that are here have been bound were
[1:18:51] bound by traditions.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; And it was this voice that called you
[1:18:56] out of those traditions
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; and had the power to deliver you.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Those you from the colonies and those of
[1:19:03] you out of Catholicism and what fear how
[1:19:06] my father how he just even spent his
[1:19:09] inheritance to try to get others. He's
[1:19:13] had printed material and sent it all
[1:19:15] over the country and caused an explosion
[1:19:18] in the north country and retaliation and
[1:19:21] persecution and hatred, open hatred
[1:19:24] which I faced right on the streets. I
[1:19:26] worried for my children which were small
[1:19:28] at the time because there was such an
[1:19:30] explosion. He spent his entire
[1:19:33] inheritance printing the testimonies of
[1:19:35] converted nuns, converted priests and
[1:19:38] how he had come out of Catholicism. And
[1:19:40] I'll tell you what, I I didn't have the
[1:19:43] nerve to do it, but I even got called by
[1:19:47] some. A woman called also my home. My
[1:19:51] stepmother answered the phone. He He
[1:19:54] wasn't afraid anything. He stamped his
[1:19:56] name right on the back of everyone. Fred
[1:19:59] Biscll. Fred. Bisc. Fred. Well, the only
[1:20:01] Biscll the people in the community knew
[1:20:02] was myself
[1:20:04] because he had only lived there a short
[1:20:06] time, came back, and he wasn't very
[1:20:08] highly visual. There I was with the
[1:20:10] little log church and and so these
[1:20:12] people this woman called said I'd like
[1:20:16] to speak to Fred Biscll and my
[1:20:20] stepmother was Norwegian very very quiet
[1:20:22] woman and she just said well he's not in
[1:20:27] just moment of silence she said I'd like
[1:20:29] to burn that pig.
[1:20:32] So that was the spirit in the community.
[1:20:37] I picked up the phone one day and man
[1:20:40] said, "Hello, are you Mr. Biscll?" I
[1:20:42] said, 'Yes.' He said, "Um, I just had uh
[1:20:47] uh he gave his name and he said, I have
[1:20:50] some question about some material that's
[1:20:52] being circulated in the mail. Do you
[1:20:55] know anything?" Well, I said, "It's my
[1:20:56] father that's doing it." And I said,
[1:20:59] "Uh, if you have any questions, you
[1:21:01] really need to talk to him." Well, he
[1:21:02] said, 'Well, I I I just thought that I I
[1:21:05] would like to find out, you know, what
[1:21:06] is the intent? What is the purpose? He
[1:21:08] said, 'Some people are have been asking.
[1:21:10] I said, 'Oh, well, what kind of position
[1:21:12] are you in that people would know to
[1:21:15] come to you? Are you a minister? He
[1:21:18] said, no.
[1:21:20] I said, are you a lawyer? No. I said,
[1:21:24] then what position are you in that
[1:21:25] people? Well, he said, you know, I I
[1:21:27] just wanted to get some personal
[1:21:28] information about it. And he completely
[1:21:30] avoided. And just at that time, the Holy
[1:21:33] Spirit spoke to me and said, "He's a
[1:21:34] priest. He's a Catholic priest." And I
[1:21:38] remembered his name. So, we had a short
[1:21:40] conversation. I wouldn't give him any
[1:21:42] information. I said, "You need to talk
[1:21:43] to my father." And soon as he hung the
[1:21:46] phone down, the priests have a residence
[1:21:49] where all the priests lived in the city.
[1:21:52] And so, I just dialed the number right
[1:21:55] back and I said, "Could I speak to
[1:21:57] Father soandso?" I said, "Just a moment.
[1:22:00] won't get him. I said, "Thank you very
[1:22:03] much." Put the phone down. You know, uh,
[1:22:07] you're not going to fool the Holy
[1:22:09] Spirit.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; I know something about nothing like my
[1:22:18] father knew about the darkness.
[1:22:20] And of course, now in this age of
[1:22:22] tolerance,
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; they're making it more palatable.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; We're not so bad. You can even eat meat
[1:22:30] on Fridays and get away with it and you
[1:22:33] won't go to purgatory and all of these
[1:22:35] things. Hey, well, I'd want to get on to
[1:22:39] that. I got enough accounts and stories
[1:22:42] and actual happenings that would uh
[1:22:46] sometime make your hair stand on end.
[1:22:49] But I come to my
[1:22:52] rejoicing moment.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; You have been set free of those
[1:22:55] traditions.
[1:22:59] I had a Pentecostal tradition
[1:23:02] and but I was not convinced that God was
[1:23:05] three and I was not convinced about the
[1:23:08] baptism but I can tell you that the Holy
[1:23:11] Spirit through the messenger convinced
[1:23:14] me and this became an open book.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Can I go on quickly for a few moments
[1:23:22] please?
[1:23:25] He said this will be the trumpet.
[1:23:29] He said the Gentiles already know the
[1:23:31] atonement, but it's to call the bride
[1:23:34] back to the original atonement.
[1:23:38] Who was the original atonement? Christ.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; The original atonement. And remember now
[1:23:42] that is the that is the revealed word.
[1:23:46] He says this will be the trumpet, the
[1:23:48] feast uh the feast
[1:23:51] the feast be rejected. then their
[1:23:53] Messiah made known. They'll know their
[1:23:56] Messiah when they see him. He's coming
[1:23:58] in power this time, the one they looked
[1:24:01] for. He's coming in power for the
[1:24:03] gentile bride. And uh and then uh I I
[1:24:07] just have some comments here, but I'm
[1:24:08] going to miss some of those content
[1:24:10] comments because I want to get between
[1:24:12] the sixth and seventh trumpet, the
[1:24:14] messenger of Revelation 10 with the
[1:24:18] seven thunder voices revealing the seven
[1:24:21] seals, the two witnesses in Revelation
[1:24:25] 11, which is Moses and Elijah calling
[1:24:28] the sealed Jews to the atonement. We're
[1:24:31] right in this vortex. You say, "Well,
[1:24:34] why? I I don't you know so much of those
[1:24:36] things I don't know and I can't keep
[1:24:38] them in order. Well, you don't really
[1:24:40] need even if you remember a few lines of
[1:24:42] what is spoken today. The purpose of
[1:24:45] this kind of message is when you read or
[1:24:48] you pondering prayerfully and you're
[1:24:51] into maybe the seals and the seals
[1:24:55] brother Brandham said he could never be
[1:24:56] the same
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; the rest of his life
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; and I assume that that should have some
[1:25:02] significance for us.
[1:25:06] And you'll be thankful next time you're
[1:25:08] in. You say, "That's what that's what
[1:25:11] brother Ed was saying. That's a quote he
[1:25:13] read. Now it comes together.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; That's the purpose of this service, not
[1:25:18] to have you up dancing in the aisles."
[1:25:22] So
[1:25:24] there's a there's the atonement trumpet
[1:25:26] sound, feast of trumpets and Jesus uh
[1:25:33] had been put out wouldn't have any
[1:25:36] cooperation with nobody
[1:25:39] uh be put out on the outside rejected
[1:25:43] for uh rejected for it's Christ made
[1:25:46] manifest among us
[1:25:49] Jesus among us all made manifest in the
[1:25:53] purity of his word.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Make it making it known. What's brother
[1:25:58] Brandham saying in a leadyian age? So we
[1:26:01] read it said he was put out.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; He but he lived it.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; And right at the end of his life, not in
[1:26:09] the first poll,
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; not in the second poll, but when the
[1:26:14] actual voice of the message came out,
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; then the door was slammed shut. Yes.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; And when they begin to hear, oh, this is
[1:26:22] what he believes. He doesn't believe in
[1:26:23] our trinity. And and remember now, the
[1:26:26] trinity was the umbilical cord back to
[1:26:28] mama.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; All the daughters,
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; all the daughters
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; are tied to Rome
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; with a false godhead
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; tradition.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; And God cut it for you.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:46] Some of you that are sitting here, you
[1:26:48] believe that and you believed it with
[1:26:50] everything was in you for years and
[1:26:52] years and years. But when God gave you a
[1:26:55] revelation of it and you heard that
[1:26:57] voice, it was cut instantly.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; And it became as clear as clear as
[1:27:02] crystal for you. Amen.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; And so now, but in the third pull of his
[1:27:10] in the last phase of his ministry, the
[1:27:13] door is slammed shut. And brother
[1:27:16] Brandon simply says there's no doors
[1:27:18] open.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; What's he speaking? He's actually
[1:27:21] speaking the fulfillment of Revelation
[1:27:24] the third chapter. Jesus standing on the
[1:27:27] outside. There was his messenger with
[1:27:30] the with the very word of God. And don't
[1:27:33] forget the word of God is Jesus Christ.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is this word made alive in
[1:27:46] its season.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; We can say, "Well, this is Jesus Christ,
[1:27:50] but you can't go and build an ark.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; You can't do a whole lot of things. You
[1:27:56] can go back to Israel. You could go back
[1:27:57] to the holy sites. You can do all of
[1:27:59] that. It won't do much for you." but the
[1:28:02] word in its season
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; at this moment
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; that God says this is a scripture for
[1:28:08] now and I'm going to send you a
[1:28:10] messenger with a voice that's going to
[1:28:12] point to that scripture and he'll say it
[1:28:15] in a veiled way and so he'll say uh
[1:28:18] Jesus is put on the outside who is Jesus
[1:28:21] it's the word in its season it was put
[1:28:23] out in Luther's time he was it was put
[1:28:26] out in Wesley's time Wesley's father I
[1:28:29] understand had a min was a a minister in
[1:28:32] in the England, but he couldn't even get
[1:28:35] behind his pulpit.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; And there was a woman that stood up in
[1:28:38] the government and declared that every
[1:28:40] pulpit should be denied to Charles
[1:28:43] Wesley.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Why? Not because they didn't like him.
[1:28:48] It was the word he was speaking.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; And so what that woman was saying, we
[1:28:53] don't want the second work of grace of
[1:28:56] of sanctification.
[1:28:59] All of Europe was saying to Luther, "We
[1:29:02] don't want justification."
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; We don't want sanctification.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; And they're saying in the last age when
[1:29:12] he was fully revealed, what the world
[1:29:14] was crying was this. We don't want Jesus
[1:29:17] Christ.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; And the only thing they were in love
[1:29:21] with was a mental concept.
[1:29:25] But there when he was made alive,
[1:29:28] living, vindicated, proven, doing the
[1:29:31] same things, he said, "We don't want
[1:29:33] him."
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; And that's what they did when he was
[1:29:37] here on earth.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; He healed him. I I'm just astounded that
[1:29:41] they that he can heal and do so many
[1:29:43] miracles in such a confined area. And
[1:29:46] within a week, they're calling for his
[1:29:48] blood.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Last week, they're wanting him to be
[1:29:52] king. This week they want to crucify
[1:29:54] him.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; What a fickle thing people are mentally.
[1:29:58] Goes to show they have that's what
[1:30:00] tradition will do for you.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; But we don't have tradition. We have a
[1:30:04] revelation.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; And that's why you're prepared to go
[1:30:07] through anything.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; And then he I I've just abbreviated
[1:30:18] these things because I must go quickly
[1:30:20] here.
[1:30:22] So this is also in the feast of the
[1:30:24] trumpets. He says, "Now as soon as this
[1:30:25] church, the bride is drawn together, she
[1:30:29] she's taken up in that mystery of the
[1:30:32] seventh seal."
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; She's taken up
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; in that mystery of the seventh seal
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; or the seventh seal, the mystery going.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; He says, and he says, "And the Jews is
[1:30:43] called to the mystery of the seventh
[1:30:45] trumpet
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; because the trumpets are for them." And
[1:30:49] he says, which is two prophets, Elijah
[1:30:51] and Moses, and they come back. He said,
[1:30:54] Pentecostals is all mixed up. They're
[1:30:58] looking for something to happen. The
[1:31:00] church is done, gone, and that's to the
[1:31:03] Jews.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; So, we don't want to. Now, we've been
[1:31:06] told, we've been warned, but we don't
[1:31:08] want to have any lag on, hang on
[1:31:11] tradition from the past. We don't want a
[1:31:14] denominational mixture with the message.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; This isn't part message and part
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Pentecost.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; This is the message.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; And he said they're all mixed up.
[1:31:31] They're looking for something to happen
[1:31:33] and Christ is done gone.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Just like the Jews were looking for
[1:31:38] something to happen and Christ was done
[1:31:40] gone. He had been there, died,
[1:31:44] resurrected, ascended up, poured out the
[1:31:47] Holy Spirit, and they knew nothing about
[1:31:49] it.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; And they still carried on in their
[1:31:52] traditions, which exactly the Gentiles
[1:31:55] are doing the same thing.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; And friends, we haven't just heard a
[1:31:58] message. We're caught up.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not doing away with the physical
[1:32:03] translation, but we're caught up.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; We've heard a voice. How are we caught
[1:32:09] up? cuz we've heard something. We've
[1:32:11] heard a voice and we have seen what that
[1:32:14] messenger is looking at. And I want much
[1:32:17] more my vision to become clear.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; So now the last sign has been shown.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; The promised son, the word has come. As
[1:32:28] it was, so is it now. There are so many
[1:32:32] opinions and questions about him.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; He said, just think of it. It's the end
[1:32:40] time, folks.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; I think we can all say hallelujah.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; The great day of the Lord is at hand.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Gather yourselves together.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; In Revelation 11, he said, "Call their
[1:32:52] ministry will be the ministry of Moses
[1:32:54] and Elias calling to Israel out of the
[1:32:57] Jewish traditions." Just as the seventh
[1:32:59] angel's message called the bride out of
[1:33:02] the Pentecostal traditions. I say no
[1:33:05] ministry
[1:33:06] in our time has caused so much
[1:33:10] controversy
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; has this message
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; now he said the last sign that was given
[1:33:20] could he give me a little more time
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; the last sign that Abraham ever seen
[1:33:26] before the promised son come was what
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; God in the form of a human being
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; that could discern the thoughts of the
[1:33:36] people. One man, not a dozen.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; One man, no matter how many
[1:33:42] impersonations and friends, I can talk
[1:33:45] about that because I lived in the era of
[1:33:48] the impersonations.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; And yet, brother Brandham in his
[1:33:53] kindness called them so sweetly, my
[1:33:55] brothers.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; My dear brothers. Oh, he's a dear
[1:34:00] brother. And he spoke so highly of
[1:34:03] those. But you know, and maybe this some
[1:34:08] might hear this for the first time, the
[1:34:10] healing line.
[1:34:14] That was brother Brandham's ministry.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Do you know why he called healing lines?
[1:34:19] Not just to pray for the sick, but so he
[1:34:21] could take their hand.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; And everybody picked up on it.
[1:34:26] So then all people start having healing
[1:34:28] lines but they didn't have like healing
[1:34:32] lines before. John G Lake for example
[1:34:34] had healing houses where people would
[1:34:37] come and they would pray for them and
[1:34:39] lay hands on them and had wonderful
[1:34:41] miracles and uh he was in South Africa a
[1:34:45] lot and had great great ministry in
[1:34:48] South Africa and outstanding things. So,
[1:34:51] but the healing line is a part of a
[1:34:54] one-man ministry.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; And then all all these others carried on
[1:34:59] with it. And then he said,
[1:35:03] "But that was the last sign that they
[1:35:06] received."
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; So now, friends, we're not looking
[1:35:10] forward for that sign.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; So just say, you know, where we are,
[1:35:16] where are we at?
[1:35:18] We're looking back and some of you young
[1:35:21] people weren't even born
[1:35:24] when we already had the last sign.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; So, we've moved considerable distance
[1:35:34] from then. And God's clock has continued
[1:35:37] to tick,
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; tick, tick. Has continued to move.
[1:35:43] Didn't matter. Doesn't matter what
[1:35:44] people think or what they say or what
[1:35:47] they look at or what they're teaching or
[1:35:50] or their opinion or their doctrine.
[1:35:52] God's clock to say,
[1:35:56] "Oh, brother Bisco, what would you
[1:35:58] recommend?" I'm coming to that.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in that time was
[1:36:05] telling them, "Don't listen to the
[1:36:08] denomination. Don't listen to your
[1:36:10] friends. Don't listen to your
[1:36:11] associates. Don't listen
[1:36:15] He said, and he said, and he always just
[1:36:17] said, "The word, the word, the word, the
[1:36:19] word, the word, my friends, is Jesus
[1:36:22] Christ, the revealed message in its
[1:36:25] day." That's the word. That's the word.
[1:36:29] Th this is the word. But people all over
[1:36:32] the world have this in their shelves and
[1:36:34] they they're listening it being preached
[1:36:36] at from this morning. This is you can
[1:36:39] get the you can you do you know do you
[1:36:41] know that all the
[1:36:44] all the basis of employer employee
[1:36:47] relationship that that actually is is
[1:36:50] the foundation for unions
[1:36:54] it's here in the Bible
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; it actually comes out of the out of
[1:36:58] Moses out of what God told Moses
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; how you are the the the social structure
[1:37:06] how you deal with poverty
[1:37:08] how you deal with your employer and and
[1:37:11] what you need to do. That's all here in
[1:37:13] the Bible
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; and its roots.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; And I have read this by non-religious
[1:37:18] people, but it actually comes out of the
[1:37:20] scripture.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; It's you can get all kinds of things. We
[1:37:27] can go into the Psalms and you know it's
[1:37:30] poetry.
[1:37:31] We can go into the proverbs and what
[1:37:33] wisdom there is in the proverbs and we
[1:37:35] can take nice choice little subjects and
[1:37:37] go on and speak. It's it's it's
[1:37:39] excellent. But it's not Jesus Christ to
[1:37:43] you.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; It's subjects of the word of God.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; I must move along.
[1:38:01] I just want you to think now these
[1:38:04] things I said in this in between time
[1:38:07] I'd like to give it another terminology
[1:38:11] things that have happened between the
[1:38:14] son of man and the son of David.
[1:38:18] So he said he comes in three sons names.
[1:38:20] Now that's all in the what we're
[1:38:22] speaking of. He comes in three sons
[1:38:24] names. He comes in I'm talking about
[1:38:26] where are we at? But where was he? He
[1:38:29] comes in three sons names. One God comes
[1:38:32] in three sons names. Son of man. That
[1:38:35] was Jesus Christ on earth. He died,
[1:38:38] rose, waved over the people, ascended,
[1:38:41] became the high priest for us could be
[1:38:43] touched with the feeling of our
[1:38:44] infirmities. And that he was a son of
[1:38:47] God because God is a spirit sent the
[1:38:50] Holy Spirit that we could receive it. As
[1:38:52] a son of man, he could not be in all the
[1:38:55] people. That's right. But as a son of
[1:38:57] God, he can be in the people.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; And that is why he became the wave loaf.
[1:39:02] So you can eat the loaf. It's one loaf.
[1:39:04] And so the one loaf goes into many
[1:39:06] people.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Is this all right?
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; And then at the end of it, he sends
[1:39:12] Elijah again.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; To reveal who he is
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; because now he's not there in a physical
[1:39:19] being. He's there. He's there. So now he
[1:39:22] inhabits.
[1:39:23] He inhabits a physical being. There he
[1:39:26] was the son of God born
[1:39:30] of a holy righteous blood conceived in
[1:39:34] the womb of a virgin. Now he comes to
[1:39:37] show his plan is progressing his plan of
[1:39:40] redemption. So he takes someone born in
[1:39:44] sin shapen in iniquities and inhabits
[1:39:48] him to show his continued redemption
[1:39:51] plan.
[1:39:52] And he's one that comes to maturity.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; And so, and the word in his mouth is so
[1:40:00] perfect that what he said in the shalom,
[1:40:03] and the word the word is once again
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; waved over the people.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; So, at the very beginning of the age, he
[1:40:12] waved the sheep that there's more like
[1:40:14] me. And at the end, he waved the word
[1:40:16] again over the people. It's already
[1:40:18] happened.
[1:40:22] Amen.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; So what now? So he comes now after the
[1:40:33] son of God. There's a breach
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; and you can read it in especially in the
[1:40:38] unveiling of God and he names son of
[1:40:42] man, son of God, son of David. Son of
[1:40:44] David is to the Jews in the millennium.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so now he comes a son of man
[1:40:51] just in a little sliver of time. He said
[1:40:53] to fulfill the rest of it. Scriptures
[1:40:56] that Jesus didn't fulfill. Jesus is
[1:40:59] fulfilling them now in a redeemed
[1:41:02] vessel.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Is that clear?
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Maybe these are things that you know.
[1:41:08] But now now between the son of man and
[1:41:12] the son of David. If he comes in a
[1:41:15] breach between the son of God and the
[1:41:18] son of David comes the son of man. But
[1:41:21] in his era he's come.
[1:41:24] God has set him aside has taken him.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; And so we talk about the first pull the
[1:41:30] sign the hand. That's all history. We're
[1:41:32] not living there. talked about revealing
[1:41:35] the secrets of the hearts and and that
[1:41:37] is I don't belittle that at all. To me
[1:41:40] that is a vindication. I go back to that
[1:41:43] all the time. I did this last week many
[1:41:46] times. This last week these things have
[1:41:49] been proven. These are vindicated.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; The things that he's speaking would
[1:41:54] almost be unbelievable. But then God
[1:41:57] comes behind him and proves it's God
[1:42:00] speaking. No man can know these things.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; It's God speaking. And so now we're
[1:42:08] between the son of man. Not between the
[1:42:10] son of God and son of David. We're
[1:42:12] between the son of man and son of David.
[1:42:15] And the one that reveals when I say the
[1:42:17] son of man. I'm speaking of Christ. And
[1:42:20] brother Brandham was a son of man
[1:42:22] revealing the son of man. And so now
[1:42:25] we're the other side of his physical his
[1:42:28] physical presence being here. But now,
[1:42:31] and Christ, listen, Christ wanted him
[1:42:34] set aside because he didn't want us
[1:42:37] distracted with the physical person of a
[1:42:40] prophet standing here. He wants you
[1:42:43] united with him, Christ, the word.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; And so, the bride hasn't only been
[1:42:54] called out, she's been married.
[1:42:57] And you already have the ring of
[1:42:59] predestinated grace put on your finger
[1:43:02] from before the foundation of the world.
[1:43:05] And you wouldn't know that without him.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; So God called this bride to himself. Now
[1:43:16] he says, "Then where are we at, friends?
[1:43:19] The seals and everything opening. Now,
[1:43:22] we're getting this uh we're getting this
[1:43:25] between here. He says, "Now, none of us
[1:43:28] know, but I'm going to tell you what my
[1:43:30] revelation is of." He's in the seventh
[1:43:32] seal. None of us know. But he he said,
[1:43:35] "The seals and everything opening." Now,
[1:43:38] he said, "We're getting this in between
[1:43:39] in in between here."
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And I'm going to tell you
[1:43:44] my revelation." He said, "I've said some
[1:43:46] things might have been kind of strange
[1:43:48] to some people." He knows it's strange.
[1:43:51] He says, "But but when God comes around
[1:43:54] behind it and vindicates it and says
[1:43:57] it's the truth, it's not William
[1:43:58] Brandham saying it's the truth." Because
[1:44:00] when he's doing something that's beyond
[1:44:02] human ability, that is God speaking.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; And so the people couldn't hear God's
[1:44:11] voice.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; And if they couldn't hear his voice, I'm
[1:44:14] coming to the main part of my message
[1:44:16] now.
[1:44:19] And the main part of the message is
[1:44:21] brother Brandham in the message look. He
[1:44:23] said when a person says look
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; he said then he said there's a voice
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; that is saying look
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; l o o k
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; and he says then then it is what is that
[1:44:37] person saying
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; and so now I'm coming to the heart of
[1:44:41] the message what was that prophet saying
[1:44:44] these things sound strange it was
[1:44:46] strange for him how could he even begin
[1:44:49] to explain what he was seeing he's
[1:44:52] seeing things in another realm.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; How could he say it? He says, "I'm in
[1:44:56] another world." How could he explain
[1:44:58] that world? You can't explain this one.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; I'm in another world.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; I'm in two places at the same time.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; How could he tell that eternal realm?
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; But now he's told us, I'm the messenger.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; This is a message of Elijah.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; This is the prophet of Malachi. This is
[1:45:19] the revealing of Luke 17:30, which is
[1:45:22] Jesus Christ. This is him and he is the
[1:45:25] word. So he says it thousands of times.
[1:45:27] He's the word. He's the word. He's the
[1:45:29] word. And he's proving also what's
[1:45:31] coming out of his mouth is the
[1:45:33] vindicated word.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; God coming behind it saying it's not him
[1:45:38] speaking. It's me speaking.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; And now he's saying to the people, look
[1:45:45] at this. Amen.
[1:45:49] [Music]
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Even the angels didn't know anything
[1:45:53] about it.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; But it's in this in between time. It's
[1:45:57] in this in between time. And just stay
[1:46:00] with me now this next few minutes
[1:46:01] because it's going to take just a little
[1:46:04] bit. But it's in this in between time.
[1:46:06] I've said all of what I've said from the
[1:46:09] beginning to let you know we're we're
[1:46:11] between the son of ma the revealing of
[1:46:14] the son of man not between the son of
[1:46:16] god and the son of David but the
[1:46:19] revealing of the son of man
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; and it was in one pole two pull second
[1:46:23] pole and then the third pole was
[1:46:26] actually the word itself but the word
[1:46:28] itself ends up with the opening of the
[1:46:31] seals and a short period of time after
[1:46:33] that
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; and it's really amazing Amen.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; This might mean something to you. Jesus
[1:46:39] lived for 33 years
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; on earth
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; and was crucified
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; and ascended.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's ministry was for 33
[1:46:49] years.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; And Jesus ministered actually with a
[1:46:53] physical ministry for three and a half
[1:46:55] years.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham here he is
[1:46:58] ministering to the populations in the
[1:47:01] thousands, tens of thousands for 30
[1:47:03] years. And then God tells him,
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; "Stop it.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to reveal the secret of
[1:47:11] my heart
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; and gives him three and a half years."
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; You'd think he'd You think God would
[1:47:18] give him 30 years to minister the secret
[1:47:20] of God's heart. But no, he draws the
[1:47:23] people and he tells them he's fishing.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; And the angel of the Lord even told him,
[1:47:28] "I'll show you. I'll teach you how to
[1:47:29] fish."
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; And he's attracting all these people.
[1:47:33] And he got all kinds of impersonations.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; And he told him now when the third pole,
[1:47:38] you will not speak of it.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; He said the angel even even uh I won't
[1:47:44] say rebuked him but spoke to him very
[1:47:46] sternly
[1:47:48] got you got your line all messed up. You
[1:47:51] got all this tangle by trying to explain
[1:47:54] it to the people. And so he said he will
[1:47:57] not explain this.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; And the reason he can't explain it is
[1:48:00] because God held it as a secret. Amen.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; That nobody knew because it's the coming
[1:48:07] of the Lord.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Friends, we're right in that season.
[1:48:13] [Applause]
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; We're in the season that the ancients,
[1:48:17] the prophets and seers desired to see.
[1:48:21] We're in that season.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; No wonder the things are going on that
[1:48:26] are going on in the world. No wonder
[1:48:28] technology is going. No wonder Hollywood
[1:48:31] is going the way it is. No wonder
[1:48:32] there's such filth everywhere. No wonder
[1:48:35] Satan comes against the believers with
[1:48:37] such a force is because we're right in
[1:48:39] that season.
[1:48:41] And I would that every believer would
[1:48:43] know we're in that time and that God has
[1:48:46] held us a secret from the eternities to
[1:48:49] this moment when you and I, little worms
[1:48:51] of the earth,
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; he's given us this great privilege.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; I would say to you,
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; don't get caught
[1:49:02] by looking at just everything else
[1:49:04] that's around us.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; So Christ was once offered and unto them
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; and I trust we are them
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; that look for him. Look for him. Who is
[1:49:17] he? He is the revealed word of God.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; He is the portion of this word for this
[1:49:23] hour that is him
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; and for them that look for him.
[1:49:30] look for him.
[1:49:33] For them and them alone that look for
[1:49:36] him the revealed work shall he appear to
[1:49:39] them
[1:49:42] the second time without sin. The first
[1:49:46] time he came and took your sin and my
[1:49:48] sin. This time there is no sin.
[1:49:56] There isn't even a trace of sin without
[1:49:58] sin unto redemption because it's
[1:50:01] complete.
[1:50:05] [Applause]
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Unto them.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; You want to be able to say and declare
[1:50:14] it whether you feel it or not. I'm one
[1:50:16] of them.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; One of them. Oh, I can say I'm one of
[1:50:21] them.
[1:50:23] and unto them that look for him shall he
[1:50:27] appear the second time.
[1:50:30] [Applause]
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; There's people even that declare the
[1:50:34] message and declare themselves to be
[1:50:36] believers and you can say exactly what
[1:50:40] Jesus Christ spoke through his mouth and
[1:50:42] they will not accept it
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; because it doesn't agree with their
[1:50:46] opinion. It doesn't agree with their
[1:50:49] decision or their tradition or whatever
[1:50:51] it is. I tell you, unto them that look
[1:50:54] for him, and only him shall he appear
[1:50:59] the second time.
[1:51:01] [Applause]
[1:51:05] [Music]
[1:51:12] You can just stay rejoicing
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; all you want.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; This is out of the
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; unto them that look for him shall he
[1:51:23] appear the second time without sin unto
[1:51:26] salvation. Unto them that look for him
[1:51:29] the revealed word. We have the whole
[1:51:32] body of revealed word is here. You have
[1:51:35] it. And there's no excuse not to look at
[1:51:38] that.
[1:51:40] [Applause]
[1:51:43] Amen.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine all the things that
[1:51:45] flies by our ears, your ears, someone
[1:51:48] else's ears? If you hear that voice, you
[1:51:53] cannot do that and look at him.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Look at him.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Because it's this voice and
[1:52:04] this voice alone that's looking at the
[1:52:07] he's looking at the physical thing in
[1:52:10] another realm.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham gives it all kinds
[1:52:14] of all kinds of examples. I would love
[1:52:17] for you to even hear that message if you
[1:52:19] haven't heard it already. Look in 1963.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; You want to hear that?
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; And he said in there just some of the
[1:52:27] things before I go on. He said that uh
[1:52:31] he uh Billy had gotten a camera and so
[1:52:34] he was looking through the camera.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; He was looking at a big saro cactus, I
[1:52:39] believe it is. And uh before he got the
[1:52:42] camera, he saw one. And he put the
[1:52:45] camera up, he saw three.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Well, there's what's
[1:52:49] wrong?" He said, "There's three." No. He
[1:52:51] said, "Daddy, you have to focus it."
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; He says, "When I focused it in, then I
[1:52:56] just saw one.
[1:52:59] Amen. And he's speaking to a whole crew
[1:53:02] of trinitarians and he took that one
[1:53:05] little thing and made
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; gave him the word out of it.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "You just need to focus it."
[1:53:11] Then he turned to the believers and he
[1:53:13] gave us a message. He said, "You got to
[1:53:16] focus out everything else and focus only
[1:53:20] on the word that's been revealed."
[1:53:23] Hallelujah.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:26] My brother, my sister, don't forget this
[1:53:28] message
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; focus. I don't care what you have heard
[1:53:32] or what you are going to hear or what
[1:53:34] what what circumstances you have faced.
[1:53:37] This revealed word will be the same
[1:53:41] every time.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; It will not change.
[1:53:50] [Music]
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:55] [Music]
[1:53:59] Hallelujah.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; When you hear the word,
[1:54:07] now these are all straight quotes. When
[1:54:08] you hear the word, it's usually somebody
[1:54:12] to get you to look what they are looking
[1:54:16] at.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; They say to you, look. Amen.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; And what the messenger was saying and is
[1:54:23] saying to us,
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; he's saying, "Look,
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; try to see what I'm looking at."
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; He said like going down the road,
[1:54:32] someone might see a certain scene and
[1:54:35] they'd say, "Look." And then express
[1:54:37] what it is.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; But the first thing to get your
[1:54:40] attention is is is look.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Because the messenger was trying to get
[1:54:45] the people to see what he's looking at.
[1:54:48] He said it depends on what the voice is
[1:54:51] trying to tell you to look for
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; in this hour
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; at this point of your life and in this
[1:55:01] junction I say when you hear anything
[1:55:04] you want to ask what is it they're
[1:55:06] trying to get me to look at
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; and they can take the word the message
[1:55:17] of the hour and saying, "Oh, this is
[1:55:20] what I'm trying to get you to see. Look,
[1:55:23] read this. This is the revelation of
[1:55:25] Jesus Christ." But some, they use this
[1:55:28] word.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; And the prophet even says they they
[1:55:31] esteem themselves. They put themselves
[1:55:34] up on a pedestal. They make ministries.
[1:55:37] And he said they're not drawing people
[1:55:39] to Christ, who's the revealed word.
[1:55:41] They're drawing people to themselves or
[1:55:44] to their church.
[1:55:46] I tell you what, friends, even from the
[1:55:48] very beginning when we were in a house
[1:55:50] and had about eight people in the house
[1:55:52] and uh and and uh uh you know that we'd
[1:55:55] see some come, we'd see some go and and
[1:55:58] just a handful of people and then the
[1:56:01] the place got full of people and we had
[1:56:03] go into the log church and all the rest
[1:56:04] of it. I've always had one quiet
[1:56:07] confidence. The bridegroom
[1:56:10] knows those that are his
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; and he will lose none of them.
[1:56:14] Hallelujah. And for the bride of Jesus
[1:56:17] Christ, don't ever mistake me. People
[1:56:20] that aren't worshiping and
[1:56:21] fellowshipping in this physical
[1:56:23] structure today and our dear brothers
[1:56:25] and sisters of ours, whether they're
[1:56:27] across the sea in the Congo or whether
[1:56:30] across the city or in another place in
[1:56:33] Abbottzford or wherever they are. I tell
[1:56:35] you what, friends, I never have
[1:56:37] questioned the the scripture, the
[1:56:39] revealed scripture. And it's the prophet
[1:56:42] that made it so clear. He he and he
[1:56:45] takes it right out of the scripture. So
[1:56:47] this becomes a living book to me. Says
[1:56:49] all that the father hath given me will
[1:56:53] come.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; And I will lose none of them.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; I will lose none of them. He didn't ask
[1:57:02] me go and be distressed. Go and have
[1:57:06] great doubts. Go and be in confusion. I
[1:57:09] say to this congregation rest.
[1:57:12] I say this congregation at all, be at
[1:57:15] peace.
[1:57:17] Peace. Peace.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I would say that to anyone
[1:57:22] that was even doubting their salvation.
[1:57:24] And I know they're a son of God. Be at
[1:57:26] peace. Be at rest.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; God is not in the business of losing his
[1:57:32] children.
[1:57:38] We give him praise.
[1:57:41] We give him praise.
[1:57:43] Hallelujah.
[1:57:45] Hallelujah.
[1:57:47] Hallelu. Hallelujah.
[1:57:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:57:53] Praise be to the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:57:55] Christ.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; I trust your feeding.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; He says the church is looking for more
[1:58:05] members, but the bride is looking for
[1:58:07] the coming of her Lord. We're all
[1:58:10] looking. He said,
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; "You've got to see something before you
[1:58:15] can tell somebody else to look at what
[1:58:17] you're seeing."
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; He says, "By faith, Noah saw. He saw the
[1:58:22] floods.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; He saw the waters of God's judgment
[1:58:26] coming down. Noah had an experience of
[1:58:29] this by faith. He saw the coming of the
[1:58:32] flood. A great rain that was going to
[1:58:34] cover. He saw it. While he preached, he
[1:58:37] saw water.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; While he preached, he saw the earth
[1:58:44] being judged.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; And the rain was going to cover the
[1:58:49] earth and take all of the wash off the
[1:58:52] earth, the redemption, rededication to
[1:58:55] God. But the preaching of Noah brought
[1:58:57] justification. And God baptized the
[1:59:00] earth with water. We didn't know until
[1:59:03] this messenger came that God was
[1:59:06] justifying the earth
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; and putting it through the process of
[1:59:10] redemption. We didn't know it till we
[1:59:13] heard this voice.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Then along came the son and dropped his
[1:59:18] blood upon it to sanctify it, to claim
[1:59:20] it for his own. We didn't know that
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; until this voice came and now it's
[1:59:26] baptism of fire. cleanse us from all
[1:59:29] germs, all diseases, all sicknesses,
[1:59:31] even all the spiritual things to make it
[1:59:33] ready for God to dwell in. He said in
[1:59:37] this great age that's to come, the new
[1:59:39] earth,
[1:59:41] he justified it in the future home, he
[1:59:44] said he justified a man, sanctified him,
[1:59:47] sent the Holy Ghost and fire and burnt
[1:59:49] the sin out of him and dwelt in him
[1:59:52] himself.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; He does the same. He does the earth the
[1:59:57] same that he's going to use in the plan
[1:59:59] of redemption. The same way
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; we didn't know. We all heard about Noah
[2:00:04] and the flood and all the animals going
[2:00:07] into the ark since we were children.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; We didn't know God was justifying the
[2:00:13] earth,
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; bring it through a process of making a
[2:00:16] justification.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; We didn't know when the blood dropped
[2:00:20] down. And I've heard so many songs of
[2:00:22] the cross and the suffering of Jesus.
[2:00:25] Never once did I hear till Elijah spoke
[2:00:29] it
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; that God was through that blood was
[2:00:33] claiming the earth as his own.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; And now the process he's brought you
[2:00:45] through, you actually bypassed the earth
[2:00:48] in its process. It hasn't received its
[2:00:50] baptism of fire, but you have. Yes, sir.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; You're justified.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Sanctified by the blood
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; and baptized with the holy fire of
[2:01:02] almighty God.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; It repented and was baptized in water by
[2:01:08] Noah. Jesus came and sanctified it by
[2:01:11] dripping his blood upon it and claimed
[2:01:12] it. And in the new earth that's to come,
[2:01:15] it's to have a holy fire baptism to
[2:01:17] clean it uh of every devil, every germ,
[2:01:21] every sickness, everything. I say, "Oh
[2:01:23] God, oh God, let every devil be passed
[2:01:27] away in that holy fire of almighty God."
[2:01:31] And there make a new I saw a new heaven
[2:01:34] and a new earth.
[2:01:37] And God here by the writer in the
[2:01:39] message look
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; bear with me just another few moments
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; by the writer who is the apostle Paul I
[2:01:47] believe uh in Hebrews yes and he's
[2:01:51] inviting us to view this to look at it
[2:01:55] we look for Christ the second time
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; we see him not as he was
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; we see him as he is
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; and we and we know that the word is
[2:02:06] Christ. Therefore, it's the word that we
[2:02:09] look to then for it's the expression of
[2:02:12] what God is.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; When God came in Christ, he was the
[2:02:18] expression of what God was.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; The light of the body is the eye.
[2:02:23] Matthew says, "And if therefore thine
[2:02:26] eye be what?
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Single."
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Say it again.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Single.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Not double, not triple, but single. My
[2:02:33] eye is not
[2:02:36] adjusted to everything around me that
[2:02:40] makes my life all blurry
[2:02:43] and adds confusion.
[2:02:46] He didn't come to confuse. Don't get
[2:02:48] caught up in anything even of your
[2:02:51] workplace or your your associates or
[2:02:54] your friends or your family or whoever.
[2:03:01] Amen.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; I might be no stick in the mud, but even
[2:03:06] as a young person,
[2:03:09] even as a young person, I believe before
[2:03:11] I actually was born again,
[2:03:14] no, I I I had friends in the world
[2:03:18] and I could only associate with them
[2:03:21] thus far and no further.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; I could not go where they wanted to go.
[2:03:28] I could not do what they want to do even
[2:03:30] without there was something holding me
[2:03:32] back. I just couldn't do it. And so
[2:03:35] whatever they were looking at and
[2:03:37] attracted to, thank God he blinded me.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; I just couldn't see it.
[2:03:44] When your mind and eyes can be singled
[2:03:47] to that word and focus that in till you
[2:03:51] see exactly what God is doing. Friends,
[2:03:55] I'm down now to the final. I'm in the
[2:03:58] last lap of this message and this is
[2:04:01] saying it all. When your mind and eyes
[2:04:05] can be single to that word, I'm talking
[2:04:09] about that word. If you folks and some
[2:04:13] maybe rarely ever pick up a message
[2:04:15] book, to me it's the wisdom of God.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; To me, it's the word of this hour.
[2:04:26] To me, it is the answer to all life's
[2:04:30] questions.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Is that word
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; we must focus our lives not what
[2:04:37] somebody else says but focus our lives
[2:04:40] to him
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; and he is the word. If we get out if we
[2:04:45] get our lives lined with the word then
[2:04:48] the word and our life becomes the same.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Watch this now. And Abraham did such a
[2:04:54] thing. And 25 years later, we find him
[2:04:57] still believing the same promise. Why?
[2:05:00] He had focused
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; his mind to the will of God by the word
[2:05:05] of God and believed it.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; If we can focus ourself to the plan of
[2:05:10] God. What is the plan of God? You think
[2:05:13] God would send Elijah here without
[2:05:14] giving us the plan of God?
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; We have the plan of God.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; We need to focus on that plan. Amen.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; And it will never stray from this word.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; He says, "Focus to the plan of God, to
[2:05:29] what God wants for us and what God
[2:05:32] promised us and let everything else
[2:05:34] alone and let everything else alone.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; No matter how long it is,
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; just keep believing.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; But focus out of you." Now, he not only
[2:05:45] focus in,
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; but he's telling you to focus out. Yeah.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Focus out of you all doubt.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Look only to that word. It It promised
[2:05:54] it.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; God said it. It's got to be that way.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; The same Holy Spirit, listen so close
[2:06:00] now. The same Holy Spirit that wrote
[2:06:02] this Bible will focus it right back into
[2:06:06] you again.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:06:10] I believe
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; this is the same messenger
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; that maybe in a few moments will call
[2:06:18] people and God Almighty will come
[2:06:22] directly behind him so that you and I
[2:06:25] will know this is God speaking to us.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; This is not a man. It's God speaking.
[2:06:31] And he's saying that if the same Holy
[2:06:33] Spirit that wrote the Bible, if we'll
[2:06:35] focus, if we will focus on it, that then
[2:06:38] that that that spirit that wrote the
[2:06:39] Bible will focus it right back into you
[2:06:42] again. Only God himself can take a hold
[2:06:45] of the camera of your eyes. What a
[2:06:48] statement. And let you see what God is
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; and what his purpose is.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:59] I say, "Oh God, Take the camera my eyes
[2:07:03] and let me see only the word for this
[2:07:07] hour.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Would you like to stand?
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; There are people almost everywhere.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Whose hearts are all a flame.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Well, sometime we have a song leader,
[2:07:27] sometime we don't. But we've got so many
[2:07:30] song leaders out there.
[2:07:33] [Music]
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; I got a little course, but I can't sing
[2:07:39] it for you right now. Is that in focus?
[2:07:44] [Music]
[2:07:47] I got a little course. I didn't get a
[2:07:49] chance to be with brother Ryan, but I'm
[2:07:51] It is just so simple, but I I just began
[2:07:53] singing to myself yesterday
[2:07:57] and I sang and wept and sang.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; He was born
[2:08:03] to be my savior.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; He was born to be my king.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; He was born to be my kinsman.
[2:08:16] And he was born to reign within.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; I was born without a savior
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; in a world so dark and sin.
[2:08:28] But I was born to walk with Jesus.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; And I was born to reign with him.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't he wonderful?
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; All right, let's just sing it there. One
[2:08:43] of them. One of them. We'll sing a verse
[2:08:44] or two of it.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; There are people
[2:08:50] everywhere.
[2:08:53] [Music]
[2:08:56] I'm baptized in Jesus name.
[2:09:00] [Music]
[2:09:05] I'm so glad that I can say I want to
[2:09:10] I'm
[2:09:17] so glad that I can say I'm one of them.
[2:09:22] I'm one of them. Hallelujah. One of
[2:09:25] them. Praise God. I'm so glad that I can
[2:09:30] say I'm going to fail.
[2:09:33] Though these people may not let it be
[2:09:38] worthy, they all receive their page
[2:09:42] baptized in Jesus name. And I'm telling
[2:09:46] now both far and wide his power is yet
[2:09:49] the same. I'm so glad that I can say I'm
[2:09:53] one of them.
[2:09:55] I
[2:09:57] [Music]
[2:10:00] praise God. I'm so glad that I can say
[2:10:04] I'm one of them.
[2:10:07] I'm one of them.
[2:10:09] I'm one of them. Praise God. I'm so glad
[2:10:13] that I can sing. I'm one of them. Just
[2:10:17] before we sing this last verse, of
[2:10:19] course, I'm going to ask our brother
[2:10:21] Victor Adamore if you'll come and pray a
[2:10:23] prayer or a blessing over the people.
[2:10:25] When you do that, please. Amen.
[2:10:29] The next verse. They were gathered in
[2:10:33] the upper room. All praise in his name.
[2:10:37] They were baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[2:10:40] God for service came. Now what he did
[2:10:44] for them that day, he'll do for you the
[2:10:47] same. I'm so glad that I can't say I'm
[2:10:51] going out there.
[2:10:53] I'm going to
[2:10:58] praise God. I'm so glad that I can say I
[2:11:02] want to live.
[2:11:04] I want to say hallelujah. One of them.
[2:11:09] Praise God. I'm so glad that I can say
[2:11:12] I'm one of them.
[2:11:15] I'm one of them. I'm one of one of them.
[2:11:21] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[2:11:24] them.
[2:11:26] I'm one of them. Hallelujah. One of
[2:11:30] them.
[2:11:32] I'm so glad that I can sing. I'm one of
[2:11:35] them.
[2:11:36] [Applause]
[2:11:38] Our brother Victor is going to pray.
[2:11:40] [Music]
[2:11:44] Brother Victor,
[2:11:47] I don't think he probably wants me to
[2:11:49] say this, but he has sacrificed very
[2:11:51] very much
[2:11:55] to fellowship with us, to fellowship
[2:11:57] with you.
[2:11:58] He's an accomplished engineer for the
[2:12:01] Shell Oil Company in Nigeria.
[2:12:05] And he wanted his family to be here and
[2:12:08] worship some years ago. and he and his
[2:12:12] dear wife Sister Victoria
[2:12:14] and children have been separated for
[2:12:17] months at a time. And brother Victor,
[2:12:20] that has been such a
[2:12:24] uh
[2:12:27] something I pondered so much and I
[2:12:29] thought of the great sacrifice that you
[2:12:31] and your wife have made. Brother David
[2:12:34] and Sam who's up in Edmonton studying
[2:12:38] and he's he's he's left the position.
[2:12:42] Oh, they would allow him to be maybe in
[2:12:46] New York or Toronto or Montreal or
[2:12:48] someplace. He said, "But no, I want to
[2:12:51] be here."
[2:12:53] And I can hear a man like that pray.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; And I can assure you he's not looking at
[2:13:00] position.
[2:13:02] I can assure you he's not looking at his
[2:13:04] salary
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; because he wouldn't be here if he was
[2:13:08] looking at his salary.
[2:13:11] [Music]
[2:13:14] I believe you focused in brother long
[2:13:16] time ago and he's had such a burden for
[2:13:18] the people over Nigeria and different
[2:13:21] places in Africa and is working with
[2:13:23] brother Kim to get message hubs over
[2:13:25] there. So you just see someone sitting
[2:13:28] here you never get maybe even shake
[2:13:30] hands with them. know maybe little or
[2:13:33] nothing about him. And we're not lifting
[2:13:35] a person up. I'm just saying the people
[2:13:38] of the scripture still live today.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; And they left all and followed him. I
[2:13:45] say, God bless you, brother Victor. And
[2:13:47] please pray a prayer of blessing upon
[2:13:50] our people. Amen.
[2:13:53] [Music]
[2:13:55] Hallelujah.
[2:13:57] I'm so excited. And uh it's wonderful,
[2:14:00] isn't it?
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; I think that's what our hearts want. We
[2:14:04] want want to see
[2:14:06] Jesus. I want to see God's word made
[2:14:08] flesh. And uh and uh I don't want to say
[2:14:12] too much. Uh
[2:14:16] I I think I'm so true this morning and
[2:14:18] uh this afternoon and uh it's wonderful
[2:14:22] and I think that's what I look for.
[2:14:24] That's what I desire my life. If I since
[2:14:27] I give my life to Jesus, I want to see
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; uh Christ made manifest
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; and um
[2:14:36] uh I also see God answering our prayers
[2:14:38] and uh coming down in such a simple
[2:14:42] humble way to make himself known to us
[2:14:45] of what he's doing and what he's telling
[2:14:47] us. Uh I think it's exciting time for
[2:14:49] me. Amen.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; I I I know that we have a lot more to
[2:14:53] see, a lot more to hear him say to us
[2:14:56] with such a starting time to us. And
[2:14:58] that's that's why, you know, um our
[2:15:01] enemy, the devil, the pastor is not
[2:15:03] happy at all. So So we we know he's he's
[2:15:08] not happy at all. He fights you at home,
[2:15:10] fights you at school, well trying to get
[2:15:13] you out of focus.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you're focused in uh this
[2:15:19] is the time that you you get stronger.
[2:15:21] Amen.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; So I I I'm certainly there's a testimony
[2:15:24] in my heart that God has made me
[2:15:26] stronger and I and I've I've prayed more
[2:15:30] than I prayed before and uh and I think
[2:15:34] that's what he wants us to do with all
[2:15:36] the distractions and all the trials and
[2:15:39] that we have gone through. I'm not going
[2:15:41] to speak for you but I I'm going through
[2:15:43] the same trials as well. But he's he's
[2:15:46] making us to focus more. Amen.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; And uh it's so wonderful. And uh I I I I
[2:15:51] can't speak too much. I think I I I
[2:15:54] don't have the words to say it. But um
[2:15:56] but the Lord knows all. He's he he he
[2:15:59] knows your heart and uh and uh he's a
[2:16:02] faithful God. Amen.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; So if we just pray for a while.
[2:16:07] Heavenly Father,
[2:16:10] what a day that you have ordained Lord
[2:16:12] Jesus for your people. to gather in your
[2:16:16] presence.
[2:16:17] And how Lord uh sometimes I imagine when
[2:16:22] you preach to the people when you had
[2:16:24] you took flesh and walk the shores of
[2:16:28] Palestine preaching uh kingdom of God.
[2:16:33] Lord, how I can imagine it in history
[2:16:37] and then come back in reality in my day
[2:16:41] and see the same word, the same voice
[2:16:44] and uttering out and speaking to me, you
[2:16:47] know, in such a way that I have no
[2:16:49] single doubt that it's you. Yes.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; So this afternoon we we we have we have
[2:16:56] uh shouted and screamed and praised your
[2:16:59] name and we have been excited as well
[2:17:01] how how you have open the this precious

[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; deepseated in his heart as revealed to
[2:17:28] him Lord and we have been dealing with
[2:17:30] him father in so many ways and trying to

[2:17:54] uh warning us and making us to focus out
[2:17:58] everything that's contrary to your word
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; and to focusing onto your unchanging
[2:18:02] word. We know Lord that word cannot fail
[2:18:05] and because he promised it Lord you're
