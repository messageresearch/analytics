[Music] Ask brother Matthew or deal to come and open the service in a word of prayer. Couple of prayer requests need to make the church aware of this morning. Sister Norine Stewart has passed away Friday evening in Edmonton. Desire to remember the family in prayer there and the saints. Brother Ernie Villa Noeva was been very sick since last night asking that the church would pray for him. Sister Shannon Smounts has asked that we pray for a friend named Gina. She has a growth and possibly cancerous that will be removed on Wednesday for analysis. She's very scared. Her son is three and a half years old and she worries that he could lose his mom. Sister Shannon told her about the prophet and of God's healing. Please pray certainly for her salvation and healing and peace to her soul and to her spirit. We want to remember that need this morning. If you'd have a need upon your heart this morning as we go to prayer, just have faith in God and reach out and touch the hem of his garment. Amen. God bless you this morning. [Music] how we love you this morning, Lord. Father, we just love your presence, oh God. Lord, we're desiring your leadership, Lord Jesus. Lord, where would we be, Father, if we didn't have one, Father, that we had confidence in that was leading us each step of the way, oh God? Oh, Father, we're so thankful to be called the wife of Jesus Christ this morning. Hallelujah, Lord. Hallelujah, Lord. How we love you this morning, Father. &gt;&gt; For your grace, Lord Jesus. Oh Lord, where would we be, oh God? &gt;&gt; Oh God, you've directed us each step of the way, Lord Jesus. Father, where we would fall and make a mistake, Lord, you're there quickly to pick us up, oh God, by a word, oh God, that would come forth, Lord, Lord, and deliver us, Father. Lord, we'd ask that you'd forgive us this morning, Lord, of our Lord, our failings, Lord, of our sin, oh God. Lord, we just want to be washed, oh God. Lord, we want to be clean before you this morning, Lord Jesus. Lord, and before we would ask, Father, we just want to thank you, Lord, we want to come before you this morning, Lord, and worship the King of Kings, oh God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Lord, you're worthy of our praise, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelu, hallelujah. We want to worship you, oh God, the great King of Kings who died on a cross for our sins, Lord Jesus. But you're with us here this morning, Lord. In our hearts, Lord. We've come together, Lord. Our licks of fire have come together, Lord. Expecting you to do great things in our midst, oh God. Lord, it might be not something big that we see, Lord, but it might be a silent movement in someone's heart, oh God. What greater work could there be, oh God, than that, Father? Oh God, there's requests here for healing, Lord, for ones who have lost loved ones, Father. Lord, but the greatest Lord is that souls, Father, would be saved for your kingdom, oh God. Lord, there's ones around the world in China right now, the brothers in China, in different places, Lord Jesus, doing work for you, oh God, for your kingdom, Lord. Lord, we here can pray for them, oh God. That you'd strengthen them, Lord. Father, I believe that each of their footsteps is directed, Lord, to exactly where you'd want them to be, oh God. that you touch that one, Father, a soul crying out for for truth, oh God. Lord, where else can they find truth, Lord? We just so privileged to have it, oh God, all these years, Lord. So we thank you, Lord, for truth, Lord. For a prophet that was sent, oh God, in this last day, Lord, to reveal you, oh God, to us, Father. Lord, we never want to take it for granted, Lord. We don't want to take your word, your message for granted, Father. Oh Lord, be with us this morning. Lord, as your word would come this morning, Lord, we want our hearts to be open, Father. Speak, Lord, your word that we would have need of for this very moment, oh God. Lord, we don't want to miss even a small thing that you'd have for us, Lord Jesus. So may we be alert, oh God. We hold the man of God before you, Lord. Lord, we don't want to see the skin this morning, Lord. We want to see Almighty God. Have your way, oh Father. Have your way, Lord Jesus. Lord, we worship you and we thank you, Father. Have your way this morning in our midst. We pray. We give you all the glory and all the praise in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is this my song? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Any Okay. &gt;&gt; What song are you going to have there? &gt;&gt; This is This is [Music] a Have your seats. God bless you. before brother Derek comes and leads us in further worship like to make uh one announcement for this week. We're looking forward to a great day on Friday. Sister Kathy and brother James Morgan, we're going to be united. That will be a great day. God bless you. But through the week then we're what we're going to do instead of Friday night, uh we're going to have a prayer meeting here at the church Wednesday night. It'll be just um for those that want to come and gather in prayer. We're going to open the church. We're going to have a prayer meeting. So, Wednesday night, that prayer meeting will start at 7:30 here in the fellowship room. And then Friday will be the wedding. Saturday night, uh brother Tim Puit will be here. We're looking forward to a wonderful time, a glorious time. And Saturday night at 7:00 the meeting will start. Then we'll have our regular services. Then on Sunday, Sunday morning at 10:30 and 5:00, Sunday night with brother Tim Puit. It's going to be a wonderful and special week. So, God bless you all. Just remember the change in the schedule. Amen. We got a special for you this morning. I can't remember everybody that was singing. So, if you'd just come, we'll just sing this chorus as they come and get ready. We also want to welcome Mary. Is Mary she in here this morning? Sister Tracy? Yes. Okay. Why don't you stand, Mary? She's just arrived from China. She's going to be attending BCA. God bless you. Amen. Amen. Happy to have you here. She's actually my daughter's roommate there at the Wong's home. She's uh my daughter's boarding there to be able to attend the school. It's a little bit too far of a drive to make it every day from the camp. So, we're really happy that the Wongs have made their home available to us while Brother Murphy's away and Sister Tracy's taken the responsibility of the family. We really appreciate that. Sister Tracy, why don't we sing this together as those that are going to be singing this morning come. This is my story. This is my song. This is my story. This is my song. Praising my savior all the day long. This is my story. [Music] This is my song. Praising my Savior all the day long. [Music] [Music] How wide is your love that you would stretch your arms and go around the world? [Music] And why for me would a Savior's cry be heard? I don't know why you went where I was meant to go. I don't know [Music] why you love me so. Those were my nails. That was my crown that pierced your hands and your brow. Those were my thorns. Those were my scorns. Those were my tears that fell down. And just as you said it would be, you did it all for me. And after you counted the cost, you took my shame, my blame on my cross. How deep is your grace that you could see my need and choose to take my place? And then for me these words I hear you say, "Father, no, forgive them for they know not what they do. I will go because I love them." So those were my nails. That was my crown that pierced your hands and your brow. Those were my thorns. Those were my scorns. Those were my tears that fell down. And just as you said it would be, you did it all for me. And after you counted the cost, you took my shame, my blame on my cross. [Music] Those were my nails. That was my crown that pierced your hands and your brow. Those were my thorns. Those were my scorns. Those were my tears that fell down. And just as you said it would be, you did it all for me. And after you counted the cost, you took my shame, my blame on my cross. But after you counted the cost, you took my shame, my blame [Music] on my cross. [Music] [Applause] I think it's in effort. Why don't we stand together this morning as we invite our pastor to come change the order of the service. We'll just sing Ellie Elohim. [Music] [Applause] [Music] I long to worship you. [Music] [Music] We long to worship you [Applause] Lord. We come to you in worship. No matter what the S stands. No matter what the situation, [Music] he will live the holy Hello. [Music] How we [Music] How we love to worship you. Oh Lord, we come. We come to you this morning. Father, hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] No matter what life situation hallelujah the situation Lord we will lift the holy hand Oh, how we worship. [Music] How we long. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. My faith looks up to thee. My faith looks up to thee. Thou lamb of Calary, [Music] save me. Now hear me while I pray. Take all my guilt away. Oh, let me from this day be holy. Oh, why don't we just sing that verse again? Oh my faith look unto thee. Thou lamb of Calary. Saveior divine. Now hear me while I pray. Take all my guilt away. Oh, let me run. [Music] Amen. Well, we're here. God's here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That That's the one that's important. &gt;&gt; He's present with us. Amen. I'll just let you have your seats for a few moments. &gt;&gt; We were saddened today to hear about uh Sister Noren Stewart. Uh it was so sudden and she just collapsed in the home and she's a young woman must be in maybe 40s early 50s and uh &gt;&gt; I think I said no. Okay. I'm going to sing that song. There's be no wires in heaven. I think that's quite an inspiration. Don't you? Who wants wires in heaven? I think about some of the performers that goes on and even even us preaching. I wonder whatever would happen if the pull the plug out. Well, we still have to preach. Amen. Uh we're just talking about sister Noren and I we're so acquainted with her mother and father for so many many years, real pillars in the church in Edmonton, brother Harold Hillbrand's church even before there were any other churches there and uh the Ellis family just such a wonderful family and I know acquainted with many of you. So let's remember them. It's even when you even when you expect someone to leave, it's not pleasant. &gt;&gt; It's always a there's a grief and a sorrow. We don't sorrow as others who have no hope. The Bible says, but I can tell you God can pour in just marvelous measure of grace and that we we really pray for them. But the Bible says if one suffer then we all suffer. If one sorrows, we all sorrow. If one rejoices, we all rejoice. So we just we really want to remember remember them and uh also one of the family of uh the Dick family a brother Abe Dick perhaps sister Aenitha I don't know uh brother Abe Fzen I think has gone and I don't know how many others of the Fzen family it was uh brother Jake Dick uh fam his brother-in-law his brother-in-law that passed away they were not believers as such but I and good Christian people and he had passed away. So some of them are driving today to go up to the funeral which will be around uh outside of Prince George I think towards Vanderhahoof someplace. So these these times come as a prophet of God said you know we can't predict these times sometimes it's a younger person sometimes it's an older person but I can tell you in none of us and that's why we want to take every service as a glorious opportunity we're here we have breath in our lungs we have a a some ability within our bodies we want to be sure that we give God the thanks that we're here and that we're able and we have a willing heart and the Holy Spirit, we cherish the Holy Spirit. Let's make every moment count for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sure that you're in agreement with me there. Well, we we've had the uh the saints from Israel have been here with us and uh we're so happy to have them each one. Uh brother Sergey and brother if sister Julia and her husband brother Roman their their daughter Tea I believe is is correct. And uh I just wanted to have uh perhaps uh I'd like to have brother uh Sergey and brother if Kenny if you would come forward please and come and stand here. We'd like I just want to have prayer uh with them. They're leaving. I think sister Julia and brother Roman are leaving right after the service. They leave today and uh and brother Fenny and brother Sergey leave tomorrow. And so I'd like to just have the two brothers if they would come forward. They've been carrying the load of the work. And if they would come forward, I'm going to have brother Eugene uh come and if you'll just come here, you brothers come and help. And this is a unique thing that's taking place in Israel. And these brothers and their people gather on a regular basis. and they've had to move a time or two because uh uh the Orthodox Jewish people don't like to have that kind of services where they're singing and worshiping uh Christian meetings taking place. But then they also have been uh distributing material of the prophet's message and uh and he said that they will receive this message. Uh it's perhaps not exactly the way we anticipate it. We do not know how he will do these things, but we expect that uh that God's will, he God's got it all mapped out, &gt;&gt; and I believe it's right on schedule. &gt;&gt; Amen. I really do. I wonder when we can have a microphone for them. I'd just like them to say a word of greeting before we just give a word of I greet you all in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Uh I'm very p privileged to be here with you. It &gt;&gt; is a great privilege for me to be here amongst you and uh partake of the word of God that's ministered by the uh local ministers here. When we were first here for the first service, we were so uh so blessed to be here and we're so filled uh filled by the word that was preached that we didn't uh we didn't want to leave. We just wanted to stay here and be ministered and uh receive the ministry of the word that's preached here. &gt;&gt; We just wanted to pack up our families and move here and be amongst you all. &gt;&gt; We really felt that we're part of the family, that we're all just a whole people here. &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember when I uh met brother Sergey when I was uh sharing my plans with him that I want to take my family and move to go to Israel and uh spend some time there. He said, "You cannot do that because you're needed uh by your brother and sister in the church and eternal life is to live for others. [Laughter] I just kind of destroyed my plans. No, it's okay. He said that his plans were ruined, but the will of God took first place. &gt;&gt; Right. as I heard in one of the uh sermons that the word of God is like snow. It falls on uh invisibly on on parts of our lives and we come and listen and we think that nothing's changed. And it comes a moment that something in our uh in our thinking and understanding just breaks apart and the will of God becomes the first place &gt;&gt; and uh towards the end of the service I I feel more responsibility to be there in Israel. Like brother Milo said, it is a privilege for us to be uh Jewish uh believers in Israel. &gt;&gt; And many people want to uh be u like Jewish, but they're not and want to live there. And uh &gt;&gt; sometimes we forget in and like in in the times when the days are gray and the days are dark and we just forget about that that it's a privilege for us to be live there. I also want to say &gt;&gt; that uh I was uh I was shocked or surprised by the size of your congregation, by the size of your houses that you live in Because in Israel we have such small places where we live and the restaurants and everything's so so mini. He said because everything is so expensive. At first we were gathering, you know, at each other's houses and after a while it was impossible. So we uh rented a little uh little house to gather in. And most of our tithes goes just to just to pay for this place that we're renting. We might not agree on many things amongst the their brother and sister, but we do agree that we need a bigger place. Because when somebody comes to visit us or somebody new comes, &gt;&gt; we we become very uncomfortable and it's not enough room and we believe that it's the will of God for us to be praying for a bigger place. We we believe that we could dream and uh wish for the will of God. &gt;&gt; So we we have a we have a right to expect something from the Lord. I also want to send greeting from all of our church. &gt;&gt; I should have said that first. This is the first time speaking such a big audience. I'm very nervous. &gt;&gt; May the Lord richly bless you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I also want to send greetings from our church in Israel. Our church is uh slowly growing and new people are coming and the problem is they're not they're not Jewish and they want to bring uh Judaism into Christianity. &gt;&gt; This is a problem. &gt;&gt; I know that there is a lot of work in Israel. Today when I was studying the Bible, I I saw something in the in the book of Romans that um Apostle Paul's um wishes was to &gt;&gt; was to uh um uh was to to awaken Israel and and the the the work in Israel. &gt;&gt; I believe that uh if if you're Jewish and you're really Jewish and you're in Israel, &gt;&gt; I believe that we're there for the witness of the Jewish people. to witness that there is a a a living God and there is a living word and not traditions that they're living by. And uh we will try very very hard to be a witness to the Jewish people to show that there is a living word for the Jewish nation to to awaken their desire for the living God. There's too much politics, too many things going wrong but going going around. But they forgot about God. We don't have some kind of a a just of a teaching. We have a living God. &gt;&gt; Because denominations they have forms and rituals, but we have a living God. And what denominations cannot do, God can use his bride &gt;&gt; to do in this end time. Many denominations, they want to convert Israel, but they cannot because they're denying &gt;&gt; they they're denying life. &gt;&gt; And I believe in that. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am very happy to uh to commune with you. &gt;&gt; I am very grateful to brother Milco. &gt;&gt; If he was Jewish, I would have taken him with me to Israel. We have a General Victor. We also have a Marshall Victor. I mean, uh, Marshall Mil, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless him. &gt;&gt; We'll be happy to see you on the land of Israel. &gt;&gt; He said, "Try to save up some money and come to Israel to see Israel. You showed us uh the beauties of this country. Israel also has beauties of its land &gt;&gt; especially beautiful uh the Jerusalem at night. &gt;&gt; Welcome to Israel. &gt;&gt; I'm also happy to uh to have communication with your ministers. I see that the Holy Spirit is moving through them. On Friday, we attended a prayer meeting and many people uh were praying because they have serious problems or needs. I know that the uh devil just always falls upon you &gt;&gt; and he is our enemy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I once read a sermon, greater Solomon is here. &gt;&gt; When he said that when Israel um recognized the the gift of God and Solomon and they united around this gift, &gt;&gt; God uh just tamed all their all their enemies, calm down all their enemies. And not one dog was able to uh move with move his tongue. &gt;&gt; And if you see God in that and you unite together and God will solve all of your problems. For God there is nothing impossible. &gt;&gt; He is a great God. If he promised something to us, he is uh he cannot fail his promises. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you. Uh stay together, stay united. Stay with the with with the ministry that was given to you by God. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] We'll just ask everyone to stand while we're going to have a prayer for our our brothers together. &gt;&gt; We're going to pray united that the Holy Spirit will anoint them and anoint the believers in Israel. Oh God, Lord, though we may not be present there, but you are present there, you will be with them as they make their journey home. You will anoint them, oh God. And we are praying that your word, the message that you have sent, the vindicated message, the proven message, the re message that reveals Jesus Christ. Reveal it to our brethren. Oh God, I pray that you'll anoint them. Father, pray as brother Sergey stands to minister as he has that you will anoint him. Father, I pray, oh God, our brother Evan, Lord Jesus, that the burden he has, oh God, and the desire he had to be there. I pray that you'll fulfill that desire, oh God. Pray that you'll anoint them each time that they gather. Lord, I pray that your Holy Spirit will make known your purpose and your will. What you've spoken through your prophet, it shall indeed come to pass in the name of Jesus Christ. I pray your blessing upon all, Father. And I pray, oh God, that your work will prosper. Lord, &gt;&gt; keep them in good health. Lord, &gt;&gt; give them good traveling mercies, Lord. Bless our brother Roman, sister Julia and their daughter. Pray oh father they will know that this was your will &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amenus. &gt;&gt; Amen. We dedicate you to God's service. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. God bless you. Bless you. Amen. Bless you. Brother Abinney. I have just I want to send back. We have a brother who's not here, brother Mike Vineyard, and he's uh he's very very gifted. He makes knives and he made for whatever reason I don't know he made two knives with the star David on them. They're just absolutely knives. These are handmade right from nothing. And then he showed them to me and he said, "I thought I'd like you to have one and I'd like to send one to Israel." So I looked at them. I kept them on the counter &gt;&gt; and I said, "These belong in Israel." And I I want our brothers to have one each and these have been handmade by a brother in the church. He's not here today. And the reason why I'm doing this publicly is they're probably streaming the meeting and I want him to see it. So, Brother Mike Vineyard, God bless you. And I'm going to give these to our brothers here. &gt;&gt; Uh, and don't carry them in your pocket on the airplane. &gt;&gt; Okay. Whichever one you like. Okay. And when you open it, &gt;&gt; it locks. And you have to push that off to the side very carefully. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much. &gt;&gt; All right. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. Do you need Do you know how to take it back? &gt;&gt; God bless you. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; They're dual purpose. If they need a shave, they can do it also. Well, I thank you for your time and allowing us to take time. If you'll open your Bibles, I want to read. And I have something that's very, very much on my heart. I don't want to uh prolong the service any longer than we need to, but we didn't want to shorten it up either, not to recognize our brothers. Uh this is a rare opportunity. &gt;&gt; Do you agree? It's a rare opportunity. I want to turn to the book of Exodus, the 33rd chapter. And we're going to begin reading at the 11th verse. Would you bow with me? And we want to pray. Father God, this is more than a formality. We are here seeking to move in the channel of the Holy Spirit of God. Father, we're asking and inviting you now to take absolute control. Lord, you have been with us through the worship service and the singing, the music, and all that has been taking place. And now the prayer with our brethren who are representative of the people in Israel. We're asking your grace and blessings upon them and now upon this congregation, upon those that are streaming this service at this time or will listen to it in the future days. Praying oh God that you will take the human instrumentality. Use father my lips. Use oh God the hearing of the people. I pray that it will sink further than the hearing and not stay in the remain in the mind but it will go down to the realm of the soul. And may it may it be life, oh God, to the soul for the Holy Spirit is the spirit of prophecy. And I pray that you'll give quickening power to the prophecy of your word for our time. Lord, let us see the message in another and a beautiful new light. In Jesus' name we ask it. Amen. And all the people said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you. We'll begin reading at the 11th verse. And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp. But his servant Joshua the son of Nana a young man departed out uh departed not out of the tabernacle. And Moses said unto the Lord, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people, and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight. Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight, and consider all, consider that this nation is thy people. And he said, excuse me, my presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest. And he said unto him, if thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? Is it not in that thou goest with us? So shall we be separated, I and thy people, and from all the people that are upon the face of the earth. And the Lord said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken, for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name. And he said, "I beseech thee, show me thy glory." And he said, "I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee, and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy." There's a profound statement that is happening here when God said, "I'll uh I will pass. I'll let all my goodness pass before thee." It has incredible depth which we can't go into at this time. Verse 20. And he said, "Thou canst not see my face, for there shall no man see me and live." Because when Moses said, "Show me thy glory." God knew that he wanted to see him face to face. And thou canst not see my face, for there shall no man see me and live. And the Lord said, "Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock, and it shall come to pass while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cliff of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by, and I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back parts, but my face shall not be seen." And I want to speak to you from out of the 21st verse. There is a place by me. &gt;&gt; May God bless his word. And as you have your seats, Moses had really desired, greatly desired. This is one of the most touching and wonderful uh passages of scripture, recorded scripture of conversation between Moses and God. And Moses is is is like he's asking a special special favor. Show me thy glory. It's so touching. It's so uh uh moving. I mean, when you think that a man has been on the mount, a man has stood before the burning bush. He stood where no person has ever stood. standing in the divine presence of God in such a way and receiving a command to take an entire nation out of a superpower, out of the hand of Pharaoh, the ruling power of the earth, and deliver this people, and take this rod, your shepherd's rod, and you will deliver them, and you'll be my voice, and you will speak. And when you speak, it will be the same as me speaking. and you will say, "Let my people go." It was an incredible thing. And God would say that he spoke to Moses like it spoke to no other person, right from his lip to his ear. And he yet he desired to see the glory of God or the face of God which Moses could not see. That and that was going to be reserved. In 1 John 1:1 it says that which was from the beginning which we have heard John speaking now the apostles writing which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life. Uh the apostle is saying we have seen something. In other words, my point to you is that God has now come down in such a fashion that there was such a transparency. So, so close. God was just veiled behind the skin of one called Jesus Christ. How close he came, how close he was for them to see him face to face. And man had never been that close to see the masterpiece itself, the absolute masterpiece, the perfect image of almighty God standing before them. But it goes to show and it's a warning to us that God can come very very near and yet people are too dull &gt;&gt; or too blinded &gt;&gt; or too occupied to see it &gt;&gt; or have taken it too much for granted and become too uh too casual about it and they failed to see what's in their day and oh they talking about Moses and the great time about Moses and the God of Moses. Moses was standing in front of them. &gt;&gt; And it's a it's it's behooving to us. I'm going to say some things today and you might think that I'm uh on track or way off track, but the prophet messenger that has brought you into this fellowship that God has used, God has used our prophet of this day and he stood and made it to this scientific uh disbelieving uh shall I say suspicious age. this age of so much psychology question everything even question themselves psychology I just want to say psychology is of the devil &gt;&gt; that's frankly what I believe you don't question the devil asked the first question and man has been asking questions ever since you don't get answers just by asking questions you you have to learn and experience an answer from God and God's answers I said the other day The last service is not always what we uh think it to be, &gt;&gt; but he came so so close. And in this generation, which is the fulfillment of Revelation 10:1, and another mighty angel descended and his as and he said it's the same one of Revelation 1. His face was as the sh sun son that shone in its strength. this face of God now and and the apostle, it was the apostle that saw it on the aisle of Patmas when he had this vision when he saw the Lord Jesus Christ, he said, "When I saw him, he fell as one dead." That's the effect that it had. And and the and brother Brandham speaks of the seven personage, the description of his person, seven of them. and starting uh his eyes and his hair and and his feet like brass that burned in the furnace and you can you can read it in Revelation chapter 1. We haven't time, but the last one was his face. &gt;&gt; And there were seven of them, but the last one was his face. Because the last age, the last time, there's never been a day like this day. &gt;&gt; There's never been a light like this light. &gt;&gt; And I want to present to you today and all who are listening to me, whoever will listen, let me say this. If others of the human race that believe that they have a prophet, including 1.3 billion Muhamadans, if they had word, I just want you to use your imagination. If they got word today that they had discovered and found where Muhammad their prophet stood in public and called people out and told them their life and told them their diseases and told them they were healed and told them that they were praying for someone and that person was in another city and told them all these things accurately. line by line by line, what do you think 1.3 billion Muhammadans would be doing today? I'll tell you, they would be scouring it. They'd be studying it. They would be seeking it out. They would be listening to every detail. They would be telling everybody. They'd be on the internet. They'd be on every social apparatus to try to make it known what a great thing has happened. And there's a danger &gt;&gt; that we have it so common that you may even have access to it and don't take time to hear it. &gt;&gt; That's what God's going to hold this world accountable for. &gt;&gt; That's what God's going to hold it accountable for. I came down. I stood by you. I presented it to you. It couldn't have been clearer. I proved it over and over and over again. But you were too busy or too occupied or became too common to hear it. Don't fall into that trap. &gt;&gt; Even in one service, &gt;&gt; how many Mormons are there in the world? &gt;&gt; Good people, fine people. Their prophet didn't do in his entire life &gt;&gt; what William Brham did in one service. Now it's on your hands. &gt;&gt; Now it's on your hands. &gt;&gt; Muhammad in all of his time. You say, "Oh, well, they didn't have uh they didn't have uh the advance. They didn't have the scientific advancement. They didn't have the advancement when when Elijah was here or Moses was here. But God still stood by them and proved that they were God's prophet. They were God's mouthpiece because what they spoke came to pass &gt;&gt; whether it was a day away or whether it was a thousand years later or 800 years later but it came to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. said, "There's a place by me." &gt;&gt; And I saw another mayy angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head &gt;&gt; and his face was as it were the sun, &gt;&gt; and his feet as pillars of fire. I've been thinking of a word and I I it's a word that we do not use very commonly but it's called it is spoken investature instead of investment it's where it comes from also but it's investature and investature is when they will call someone at a special uh arrangement they will call someone and they're going to uh honor this individual we and and they're going to at a special time the queen of England on special occasions she will call a number of people for uh a a program or a ceremony of investature and then they become maybe from a common person they become a knight or they become something else. uh they will do it in in Canada and the United States. They do it and they come they they are they receive the order of Canada or the highest uh a highest order that they will pass on to a person in America because it's some recognition perhaps of something they have done or the life they have lived and then they're not only known anymore as just an average person on the street. this person has been honored and lifted up into a into a different status. That's an investature. The it is uh the the act or formal ceremony of conferring the authority and symbol of a high office on an individual. Or it is the adornment or the act of presenting with a title or with the robes or an insignia something that identifies them insignia of an office or rank. It is a formal entry into a position or a certain office. It's a dignity that's uh conferred upon this individual. Now just hold your seats. The book of Revelation is the investature, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And Revelation chapter 1 describes the one that's going to do the investing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 1 &gt;&gt; said his face was as the sun that shone &gt;&gt; and his hair was white like wool &gt;&gt; and his eyes as flames of fire &gt;&gt; and his body and his garment was dressed in radiant garment. &gt;&gt; But he's going he has something to say. &gt;&gt; He has a word to deliver &gt;&gt; to the earth that he created &gt;&gt; and the humanity that covers the earth. He has a message to bring to them. And he has things that he has kept sealed in the mind of God for all of these centuries. But now is going to come a certain time in a season that they will not be held secret anymore. And he's going to raise up someone who by the world's standards has no has no e education and is ignorant as far as words and as far as as far as scholastic abilities concerned because it cannot be confused with man's wisdom. He's raised him up for this generation in an age of intellectualism in an age of advancement. And he comes and God proves that he is advanced far beyond science. He says things that no scientist has said yet. He has wisdom concerning the medical world. He begins to talk about cancer and the cancer cells and how they become wounded and begin to uh sap the life out of the body. And he declares that he has been visited by an angel who told him nothing would stand before his prayers. Not even cancer which is the a disease of the age. And he spoke to the cancer spoke to the bodies and the cancer dropped on the platform. It was a vindicated ministry. Hallelujah. And that ministry was found in Revelation 3. It was found in Revelation 5. It is found in revelation 10 and all through and revelation became an open book [Applause] &gt;&gt; because there was a people &gt;&gt; a selected people elected individuals &gt;&gt; when they give an investature the queen of England will call x number of people for her birthday because her birthday has come and She wants to endow a number of people with an investature and they sometimes touch them. They sometimes touch them. And I can tell you that this investature of the bride of Jesus Christ as an elected people and he took the book that had been closed and he opened the book and said, "I invest upon investature. You are being changed from church to bride. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you're entering another office. &gt;&gt; You're going from bride to wife. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you have all the rights of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're not going to be just what you think you are. You're going to be what I tell you you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Have you got my thought? &gt;&gt; Come &gt;&gt; now &gt;&gt; and stand by me &gt;&gt; because there's a place by me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't have to stand where you stood. You don't have to be in that despondency and discouragement. You don't have to be in that same old pit you were in. You don't have to be plagued by those complexes. There's a place by me &gt;&gt; and that place is a place of peace. &gt;&gt; That place is a piece of deliverance. &gt;&gt; That is a special place. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen. They put robes on people. &gt;&gt; This is a a wonderful occasion. They're going to come before the president of America and receive a medal around their neck and beautiful ribbons and they dress them and array them in beautiful robes and they come walking up amongst the people and the people are dazzled as they look upon these uh selected ones, these elected ones. But I'll tell you one day, my brother, my sister, you even recognize it now. People recognize the bride of Jesus Christ. You are different. &gt;&gt; You look different. &gt;&gt; You speak different. &gt;&gt; You are different. [Music] &gt;&gt; Jesus said it. It's a fulfillment of his words. You are of this world. You are in this world, but you're not of this world. You don't belong here. &gt;&gt; Jesus is telling you clearly, you're for another place. I've prepared the place and I'm preparing you for that place. &gt;&gt; And we know it from the scripture. Even holy angels will stand silent as the bride adorned bride in her gown of the word of God. Hallelujah. Redeemed ones, glorious ones, ones who've overcome the world. Hallelujah. One who's overcome all the things of this life. One who's overcome it. &gt;&gt; Here come the overcomers. Here come the victorious ones. &gt;&gt; Here come the ones that Lucifer could not deceive. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. Here come the ones. Some of them came up through school and the halls of education and they came up through economics and they came up through difficult times but they denied Satan at every front. &gt;&gt; They would not bow. They would not bend and they would not burn. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is this just a pipe dream? &gt;&gt; It's just some mysterious thing. It's a reality &gt;&gt; and it's for you. &gt;&gt; And if Satan has taken the reality of it away from you, you don't you you start rejoicing now. This is mine. &gt;&gt; This is mine. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And to her was granted that she should be arrayed &gt;&gt; in fine linen, &gt;&gt; clean and white. &gt;&gt; For the linen is the the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints. And Abraham believed God &gt;&gt; and it was counted to him. He didn't earn it. It was counted to him. It was attributed to him &gt;&gt; that he was righteous. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He lied, but he was righteous. &gt;&gt; He had a backsliding time, but he was righteous. &gt;&gt; His believing was stronger than every other weakness. [Music] Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Jacob had his He was called a shyster. &gt;&gt; Prophet said he was called a shyer. &gt;&gt; You've seen me do it. That one page between the Old Testament, New Testament. &gt;&gt; Over here was animal blood, &gt;&gt; but here was the blood of Jesus Christ. And none of the things that they did over here could pass through Calvary. Not a single thing. In fact, it's God like rubbed it in the s in Satan's face. &gt;&gt; David took Bath Sheba, &gt;&gt; but over here she's called a mother of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. That's your Bible. And that's my Bible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's not one of the things, not one of the records the other side of Calvary that can come through that shield of blood. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; And there came unto me one of the seven angels, which had the seven vials, &gt;&gt; full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither. I will show thee the bride, the lamb's wife. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She has been there has been an investature conducted in revelation and she has passed from just a woman that was forgiven. She's passed through the bride and has passed from a bride in a bride perhaps that has been, you know, has been betrothed, but she's passed beyond that into a wife. And she's a virgin wife. &gt;&gt; The same as Mary &gt;&gt; virgin. But she's been pregnantated by the seed of her bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And bringing forth the son of God &gt;&gt; in his next office. &gt;&gt; For he'll pass from that to become king. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's her husband, but he's king of Israel. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I speak to you brothers and those of you from Israelise &gt;&gt; in the power of transformation. He said, "Now we find everything in order." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God spoke it &gt;&gt; and he said, "Let there be Let there be. &gt;&gt; Let there be an an Eden &gt;&gt; and let there be a beautiful flowers. &gt;&gt; Let there be my son in my own image. And let him stand oh there over in the Garden of Eden. and let his bride, it's God speaking, let his bride stand by his side. &gt;&gt; You think you're sitting in a seat. Let me tell you something, friends. The one that descended, that spoke it in Revelation 10. He's descended because there was a people that were ready to stand by his side. I'm identified. I stand by the side of this Lord Jesus Christ. I'm identified with this word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Nothing can move &gt;&gt; this woman. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not church. &gt;&gt; Don't sit here feeling this is just church. &gt;&gt; We're not having church. &gt;&gt; We're a we're we're moving in our capacity. &gt;&gt; We're a different kind of people. Not because I'm saying it, because God said it. &gt;&gt; I say to you, who is this bride? &gt;&gt; I say to you, who is this spotless one? &gt;&gt; I can tell you there'd be You think the Palestinians are dancing on the street because a representative, Mr. Ababas, is standing in the United Nations to declare that there's going to be they're going to declare a Palestinian state in Israel. and they're they're praying and dancing in the streets and having such a time. What a scene it is at the at the hopes or the anticipations of statehood. Listen friends, we're not we don't have some man. &gt;&gt; We don't have some man on our side. We have the king of kings. &gt;&gt; We have the one who hung on Calvary. We have the one, the one who came out of the tomb, who's invited us and said to you through this word, through this message, there's a place &gt;&gt; by me. &gt;&gt; Would you like to stand there? &gt;&gt; Would you like to stand by this bridegroom? &gt;&gt; There's a place. &gt;&gt; There's a place by me. I'm the alpha. &gt;&gt; I'm the omega. &gt;&gt; I'm the beginning. &gt;&gt; And I'm the end. &gt;&gt; I'm the answer &gt;&gt; to all of the world's dilemas. &gt;&gt; Come and stand by me. [Applause] [Music] Revelation is not just a book in the Bible. Revelation is where this person, these elected ones, &gt;&gt; have been called to an investature &gt;&gt; where she's robed in a different robe &gt;&gt; and given a different title &gt;&gt; and passed from one office to another office. My brother, my sister, if you miss this service this morning, if you miss the depths of this meeting in its simplicity, you're going to miss what God has for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Philadelphia church 8, the bride goes wherever the bridegroom is. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; She will never be left by him. She will never be left by him. &gt;&gt; Hello. Some of you folks who felt he hasn't been near you. &gt;&gt; Here's a vindicated prophet's word. She will never be left by him. &gt;&gt; I'm driving it home. I'm not trying to preach. I'm not trying to preach it. I'm not trying to convince you. I just feel inspired of the Holy Spirit cause these people to see it. [Music] It's a simplicity of it. She will never be left by him and she will never leave his side. &gt;&gt; She will share the throne with him. &gt;&gt; She will be crowned with the glory and honor. &gt;&gt; You talk about an investature. You might go to a graduation and have a little scroll rolled up and someone touch your head with your cap on and say you have now passed. You have now achieved a certain status and now you're to be recognized as Dr. So and so or master so and so or whatever more. I want to be touched by this word that says that have it handed down on my mind. You are now the spotless bride of Jesus Christ. And I I give you an investature of eternal life before the foundation of the world. But now I'm passing the knowledge on to you. You are invested. I am also in this investature letting you know that you are sinless. [Applause] You want to keep your sin, keep disbelieving. &gt;&gt; You want to be free from it, believe what I'm saying now. This is the invested chart. &gt;&gt; There's no sin in this word. &gt;&gt; And she's being invested with this word. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to pregnantate you with this word &gt;&gt; and you're going to bring forth the word. Why can't we get excited? [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now I know why I was guided in such a way. I had I had some pictures I was going to show you on the slides and I decided no, these are great places. There are physical places that have special meaning. &gt;&gt; Physical places. There's the pyramids of Egypt or the Great Wall of China who I and my wife, we walked on the Great Wall of China. I tell you what, it's awe inspiring when you stand there and go up these steps and see these thousands of people and you get up to a certain peak and you just see it go down the valley and up the other ridge and over that hill and you can catch glimpses of it. It goes on. I said to brother Murphy, "How long does this wall go?" Said, "5,500 miles." And I looked down to see each individual stone. man had to take that stone by hand and place it there and another one in some mortar. Stone by stone by stone. 5,000 500 miles, 8,100 kilometers of wall and with thousands of uh lookout places. Just incredible. And this was done by man for protection, for security. But they didn't find China's had her wars. She hasn't found the peace. But there's a place &gt;&gt; by me, &gt;&gt; a place of safety, &gt;&gt; a place of assurance. &gt;&gt; If you don't have full assurance today, deny the place you're in and say, "There's a place that's been set aside for me by him." [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; He that descended. Hallelujah. He is the one &gt;&gt; that said he has a place &gt;&gt; by him. &gt;&gt; They have places. Victoria Falls, a lot of people go to Niagara Falls and there's places that inspire people. There are other places. Now I want those are physical places but there are other places that are symbolic and they inspire very very deep movements at the moment when a person is there because it calls for a man or woman. It calls for a person to come and stand. in a holocaust museum in in Israel. There's Yadvashm. That's the Holocaust Museum. And if you go there, you'll only be one of 1 million over 1 million people a year. Each year goes through that museum. Covers about 45 acres of property. And there different kinds of uh museums. A few days ago, we had the 10th anniversary uh of of the World Trade Towers, and it still is it's more than inspiring. It's just unbelievable. I have seen and watched these towers go down and I can scarcely believe that all that steel, all that millions of tons of steel could just crumble as those top floors were belching out their evil smoke uh done by just 19 men. 19 men and flew those aircraft. And they planned, they they studied, they studied to become pilots. They studied in Florida. And it's amazing to me how that America, the system of America, they're so open, such an open society, so generous, received these people, and gave them status in America. And they studied and studied how to fly with it with it in their mind. I'm going to fly as a pilot, a plane for my faith into this corrupt nation and do what they could to destroy it and wiped out almost 3,000 people, 2900 and some people who are killed in the planes and the various things. Just a few days ago, you young people live to see it. You can see it on your computer. And uh and the people come by and they come by solemnly. They come by, they're not dancing. They're not hearing some wild music. &gt;&gt; This is a different This is a time of somnity. &gt;&gt; This is a time to remember. &gt;&gt; This is a time to be affected &gt;&gt; by what happened. And they walk past those hundreds and hundreds of names at this memorial and they bring flowers and they weep and they have different experiences because some have lost fathers &gt;&gt; and mothers and brothers and sisters and family or friends and they walk past this and the last few days have been filled with it as they walk past is a serious moment for America &gt;&gt; and they saying, "Never again. Never again, we shall rise." The words of the president of the United States, he used some scripture at this solemn time and at heart-wrenching time for the nation. And he quoted from Psalms 46 the words, "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore, we will not fear, though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea." Those are the words that he spoke in and in in in a way to let the world know that this thing has not broken our will. And this thing has been done by evil men with evil ambitions. But America, and I will say, as long as America would honor God, &gt;&gt; God would honor her. But she has turned down &gt;&gt; a message &gt;&gt; by a man &gt;&gt; who God raised up out of their soil &gt;&gt; that was sent by God to make this book live. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Preach it. &gt;&gt; I want you to be get ready to declare it &gt;&gt; as some of you have already. You declare it. &gt;&gt; I'm with you. I believe what you're saying, brother Visco. &gt;&gt; I believe in this messenger. &gt;&gt; I believe he made this word live. &gt;&gt; I want you to go home thinking about 1.3 billion Muhammadans and and about those that serve Islam and they're all throughout the earth. There's plenty in this country and also in America and Europe. Many, many of them. If they found, if they discovered Hey kids. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If their parents discovered the words of Muhammad and that he actually faced the public and called people out by their name, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; and said, "This is why you're here." &gt;&gt; And I see you traveling. You're traveling from the east coming west to be here in this meeting. And you have sister, you have a letter in your purse &gt;&gt; and that purse is from your daughter &gt;&gt; and told you not to come here because I was coming to this city. If Muhammad had said such a thing, you wouldn't be able to control those people. &gt;&gt; By the way, and everybody listening to me on the internet and ever will listen to me, you got it on your shelves. You got it beside your bed. You got it in your car. You've got this in your car. Why did God do this? &gt;&gt; It was to shake you and I &gt;&gt; to move us to let us know the time of investature has come. &gt;&gt; And we are no longer to be a church member. &gt;&gt; We're to be a member of the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We're to take our responsible position. We've been robbed with a different robe. We've got a different insignia. We've got a different identification. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends? [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm praying that God will do something different here this morning in your heart as you say, I accept that. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't need to see your hands. I don't need to see your rise. I don't need to see you enthused. But God needs to see what's happening in your heart. &gt;&gt; And if something happens in your heart, usually there will be some kind of expression. &gt;&gt; Even if you nod your head, &gt;&gt; I don't need you to nod your head. I don't need you to raise your hand. But if you want to stand and you want to scream out praise be to God. &gt;&gt; I say God bless you. However, however, God will minister to you. [Music] &gt;&gt; So, there are physical places, but there are places also that are physical, but they have a they have a depth. People go to Sunset Mountain, they go to Sabino Canyon, they go to different places. I don't read in the scripture where they ever went back to the burning bush or where Moses ever went back to it. &gt;&gt; But it was certainly sacred at that time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take off your shoes. &gt;&gt; The ground you stand on is holy ground. It was only holy while God spoke with his prophet. &gt;&gt; When he left there, there was no more holiness on that ground. &gt;&gt; Right now, today, this place has become a holy place. This is not just Cloverdale Bible Way. This is a holy place &gt;&gt; where God seeks to convene. God has convened a meeting &gt;&gt; to speak to whoever has ears to hear. &gt;&gt; And if you will hear and open up your heart and open up your soul, not only your mind and ears, but your soul, God has something to say to you. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; The Temple Mount. I went up there with Rabbi Richmond on Temple Mount. We tried to go once before. They wouldn't let us. And then they had opened it up so we could go. And as we went, he said, "We cannot pray. We Jews cannot pray up here." But he said, "I want to pray with you. So I will pray as we walk. We will pray." And we just continued to walk. We had people secret service watching because him being a rabbi probably watched more than other people. And as we walked, he prayed and he thanked God that he could be walking to we could be walking together on the holy mount &gt;&gt; and we will walk around the entire circumference of this mountain because God, we are claiming this mountain. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'd walk around the church, but you'd lose sight of me if I went out the door. So we claimed the whole mountain. Glory to God. That's according to the word. I was so happy to walk around that mountain, claiming this mountain with a rabbi. Hallelujah. Who I trust makes is one of the 144,000. &gt;&gt; But there's others that claim that mountain and the Palestinians, the Arabs claim that mountain because it is the Dome of the Rock. I was in India. I can't take time with this because it's too much to say but I was in India and uh brother David was there remember we went to that temple and oh quite a number about 14 of us were there. Brother Tom Brown was there and and and we went to this temple. They said that there's a uh he has a 100,000 followers, this guru, this leader. And uh and and we went to people rolling on the floor, marble, marble everywhere, offering boxes, our offering boxes, kindergarten. And the way incidentally when you leave, don't forget it even though it is small. They had offering boxes this high about this square. They're big all steel with great big padlock on it. I almost got a revelation. My they got a lot of faith to put offering boxes like that. They were positioned at different places. And then they they uh what are all these people coming here for? I'm going to cut it real short. So they said, "Well, this place here, all these people are lined up and they're all in red and they're moving through here and uh and they all had to have some ashes put on their forehead and all of these ceremonial things." And then as we came up, there was a little we little we tiny square box of a room and that was the Holy of Holies. And I thought, "What is it so holy in there?" And there was a rock about that big sticking out of the ground. And they were rubbing it with all kinds of uh spices and things and rubbing it ochre. I think they were rubbing it with ochre. And it was just kind of brown and yellowish ochre and rubbing this stone. Thousands and thousands. Some of them had just walked over 200 miles. We saw them on the road walking in long lineups to come up and get some ashes put on their head and and see that stone. I said I didn't want to be rude. I said, "Wow." I said, "I could take these people to Saskatchewan and show them a mill of the million of these stones &gt;&gt; that the wind blew and left the stone out of the That's what they told I said, "Well, what what's so special about the stone?" "Oh, a big wind blew through here once and left this stone appearing out of the ground." I said, "Well, of course it appeared out of the ground. If a strong wind blew and blew the dirt away, there's a stone was there." No, it became a holy place, a holy of holies. What do you think those people, if that man has started to say to the people, "Thus saith the Lord, &gt;&gt; this is what happened. This is why you came and began to reveal the secret to their heart. I tell you what, friends, people are following. They don't know what they're following. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I'm putting the emphasis. People have been saying to me recently, it seems that you've been putting the emphasis on the message. You want to believe it. &gt;&gt; There's never been a message like that message. There's never been a time that almighty God, God of the universe, creator of all things, there's never been a time he sent a man, a human, to the earth and said, "I'm going to stand by you, &gt;&gt; and I'll never leave you, &gt;&gt; and I'm going to I won't let the words out of your mouth drop to the ground. It shall come to pass." &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, friends, there's a few things that haven't come to pass yet. Don't wait till they do. I expect to be moving out of here. California is going to sink into the ocean. &gt;&gt; California is going to sink into the Pacific. I'm not I don't even look to see if there's been a tremble here or shake there. Whatever more the shake came by way of the word of God. &gt;&gt; It will weep its way. The ocean will weep its way into the desert. &gt;&gt; That's thus sayith the word of God. It's already been proven. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we have these places that that are bring us to a state of awe and wonderment, a little place and people come there and it's very sacred and very moving for them. These are places where when they walked by the towers and saw those names, they thought about the men, they thought about the firemen, they thought about the police, they thought about all these people and uh Canadian Broadcasting, they had a program. It was really incredible. They worked for all these years, for these last 10 years. Don't know if you had one in America like it or not, but they got the voices. They got all they compiled all the voices of the people that were phoning from home with the people that were in the building and the people that were in the airplanes and all they put put it all together in one program. It's about one or two hours long. Don't ask me for it. I don't have it. It's a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. And I listened to those people speak. I listened to fathers and husbands speak to their wives and and how and and how calm they were. And then some got urgent and they couldn't speak and they they were they were being completely consumed with with dust and choking and they couldn't they one said, "Well, go to the stairwell. Go to the stairwell and go down two, three floors." And he went to the stairwell and came back and said, "There is no stairwell. It's collapsed." about three floors of the stairwell has collapsed. People were in all of these states. I can tell you that as they walked past that memorial, this is what they were thinking. &gt;&gt; They're thinking about these people, they're thinking about the children that remained. And so my point now, listen closely because this is a major crux in the service. My point is that we can come to a place where we ponder something that's happened. And I want I want everyone in this congregation that's ever been touched by him, I want you to go back now in your thoughts to the service to the servant of God who was speaking or to the place where you were sitting or out maybe in nature someplace. You were sitting by yourself. You may have been sitting in the quietness of your home. There was some moment when you knew that the almighty one had come very near. I want you to ponder about that. I want you to ask yourself and ask him, why did you do that, Lord? I know it was you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why did you touch me? Why did you touch me? What was the purpose? The road has not been easy since. It was not easy for Abram. It was not easy for the ones of the old. It was not easy. They had their hardships, but you touched them. The Bible tells us that Abraham when he went away from his land and his country and his people I'm going to make this I'm right down to your address. I think so much of brother Joe and Sister Eileen Waldner, Sister Kathy and others but there was five of them and their children. David came afterward, but there was Anita and Julie, I believe, and they flew the family. We had to send them tickets and they arrived in the little log church on a Sunday. We had to get a man because they were in a very tight colony and a breather believer brother, brother Jake Wall from Edmonton. He was in Winnipeg and he drew he drove the car in and they all jumped into the car just with their shopping bags. Brother Joe, Sister Eileen, that's one of the reasons I continue to honor you with such a deep respect. They left mother. They left all their friends, left their relatives, and drove out with a finality of perhaps never returning again. Do you know why? Somebody touched them. &gt;&gt; And I'll never forget, sen, excuse me for using your testimony, but there are things that I remember and I'm going back. I'm pondering things today. And she walked into the foyer, the little log church, and tears were streaming down her cheeks. And she looked at me like this and she said, "These are not tears of sorrow. These are tears of joy." &gt;&gt; I never forget that. And it's been glorious ever since. &gt;&gt; And God has answered many of their prayers and will continue to answer them. and given them their family. I tell you friends, this is a living God. &gt;&gt; This is a living way. &gt;&gt; And people who embraced and loved and loved that Lord Jesus loved that message long before they were around any other believers. Long before they were in this kind of an atmosphere, they believed it. I want you to go back where you were touched. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. On occasion, I've I've said to my wife just once or twice, I said to my wife, I'm just going I'm going for a drive and I actually drove several hundred miles and it was a beautiful fall day and I was waying farther north and I stopped my pickup and I got out on the bank and the sun was shining and the colors of God's God began to paint the scenery with his brush somewhere yellow and bronze and the dark green of the spruce and the lake big lake out in front of me about 700 miles north of here and I laid on the bank. This is what I said. This was one of the moments I'm seeking to bring you to this morning. I said, "Father," I went back said, "That was you. That was you back there. I know that was you." Because there's no sense, there's no feeling, there's no atmosphere like that. I know that was you. Then there was a time at further down it was all completely different. But I know that also was you. And then I moved forward and I said,"I know that was you." And by the time I had gone through three or four of those experiences, I began to feel a different presence. &gt;&gt; It wasn't me. It was different presence around me. And father, I know this is you. Then you can ask your questions. Why did you call me? &gt;&gt; What would you have me to do? &gt;&gt; Tell you what, that that atmosphere leaves you so humbled, so quiet, and so peaceful. It's a wonderful atmosphere. And friends, if you haven't had that experience, you young people, if you haven't had that experience, oh, if I could take you, I'd like to take you to him. I'd like you to begin to feel that. Dear friends, I don't even feel like I'm preaching. I need to talk to you. I just yesterday I just just need to talk to the people. That's precisely why this message was sent. &gt;&gt; Not to give you a different doctrine or a different church, &gt;&gt; but to draw you into this atmosphere. &gt;&gt; For in this atmosphere, Brother Roy, the supernatural is happening. In this atmosphere, your natures will be changed. In this atmosphere, what you hunger and crave for will be satisfied. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's what the church needs. &gt;&gt; We don't need better music or better this or better that. &gt;&gt; We just need his presence. &gt;&gt; We want to have the meetings until he's so pleased that he's comfortable. &gt;&gt; And I've come amongst you. Tell you what, friends, everything else just passes off the scene. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says of Abraham that he journeyed and he came to a place. I'll never get through this message. I'm just going to stop. I'm going to watch my time. He journeyied and he came to a place and he built an altar and the Bible says and there he worshiped. Hold that. Then the Bible tells of his other movements and you read and he returned again. He returned again. He went back to where he had been &gt;&gt; as I was saying to you. He he went physically. You can go back mentally. You go back in your mind. These people that go to the Holocaust Museum or go to the Dome of the Rock or go to these other places, the that physical stone and that physical place doesn't mean anything but what it symbolizes, what it means of what has happened there. And they believe and they come to that rock. This is where Abraham offered his son Isaac. And they think about that and they're going back and they and they also anticipate the temple being rebuilt and the temple is going to stand here and there's a rejoicing. Well, Abraham, he had been God had promised him a land. God had promised him a land. Hold hold it closely, friends. God had promised him a land. A land. I'm a wanderer. I'm a pilgrim. I'm a sojourer. And God has promised me a land. I've got to worship him. I've got to thank him. I got to build an altar here. I want to remember this place. And he built an altar and he worshiped God who gave him that promise. And then he traveled. He traveled and he had all kinds of problems. He traveled and he goes wherever he puts his foot, he keeps traveling and he comes back and he comes back to the same spot. And at that spot, what does he remember? God promised me a land. God promised you a life in the Holy Ghost. And maybe you walked around a lot over the last few years. And you haven't seen that life in the Holy Ghost, but you're a son or daughter of Abraham. You don't forget the promise of God. He wouldn't forget the promise. God gave me this promise that I would inherit this life. I would inherit this land. And now I will I will come and I'll build another altar and I'll worship God once again. Why? Because he believed that was the truth. And Jesus when he come on the scene, he says they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's what God has said. &gt;&gt; And I say to you the truth, the only truth that I know that God vindicated. If you have another one, you're obligated to show it to me. But God stood behind one man. Well, God stood behind this prophet of God, William Brandham, and confirmed every single service. &gt;&gt; And proved it. &gt;&gt; We're not following old wives fables. &gt;&gt; We're not following some mystic strange stuff. &gt;&gt; We're following what God from another realm came on the scene and proved it and confirmed it and said clearly, "It's me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And all we're doing, we're saying, "You drew me into this." &gt;&gt; Maybe some of you young people, you were born into it. I'd go back there. Some of you are not very young. You may have been past 50 now, but you were born into a believing message. Those of you that are seated here and have children that were born into your family and they're not serving God, you have a right this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have a right in this service. &gt;&gt; You say, "Our pastor is preaching and I believe that word &gt;&gt; and I dedicated those children." &gt;&gt; Yes, I dedicated those children. God bless you, brother Wes. God bless you. I think see you, Sister Violet. God bless you. I don't care how far people get from God. I want you to sit here today and say, "I believe that promise. &gt;&gt; It was thus sayeth the Lord to me. I've got loved ones. I've got children. I've got loved ones. And I'm holding fast to them." [Music] In the name of Jesus Christ. In the name of the God of Elijah. In the name of the God and father of my Lord Jesus Christ. In the name of the God of William Brham. That name is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; And I claim them. &gt;&gt; I'm here friends to speak to you to do business for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't have time. Our time is slipped away. &gt;&gt; But there's a whole another part of this service and the prophet of God and where this service came from. And I'd love to have brought up some quotes for you and show them on the screen, but you understand English. You understand my language. He says the God's only only provided place of worship. &gt;&gt; There is no other place. &gt;&gt; And he said if God has only one place, it's not in a church &gt;&gt; and it's not a Presbyterian or the Baptist or the Pentecostal or the Catholic. They all have their belief and people hold to those beliefs because they believe that those are right and we respect them for believing and holding to their beliefs. But that is not the place that God spoke to when he said to Moses in that you will offer your sacrifice in the place that I choose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And my point to you is God in this generation chose who he wanted to stand beside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And my confidence that he stands by me is because I'm standing with the word that came out of the mouth of him who he said he will stand beside. &gt;&gt; And we stand there. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And as I think about that, I think about a log. I think about a place just where a little dirt trail ended and walked off into some grass. You forgive me, but that's the kind of service we're having. I think about a young man 26, 27 that had all kinds of questions. Questions? My heart was so heavy. I saw what I thought was the best churches in the country going into a into a downward slide. And you could preach as hard as you want. It seemed there was no way to turn it around. And I was sitting with a man about this far away and he said he came to me. I was so glad. I was sitting beside somebody who he could come to &gt;&gt; say you have some questions. You have three and these are I've been telling you quite a bit about that. I've told that several times in the last few weeks. Why? Because, friend, everything, my faith is pinned and hinged on a living God. &gt;&gt; I don't want to just come here to church and this is a Wednesday night meeting and this is a Friday night service or prayer service. That isn't it. We want to come into this house of God and expect to see answers to our prayers. We want to see our lives grow. We want to see things take place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We need supernatural answers, &gt;&gt; do we not? &gt;&gt; And let's be open for them. Let's be ready for them. &gt;&gt; But he said clearly, there's only one place &gt;&gt; and Jesus said, and I and that place, I'm not speaking of a physical structure. I'm not speaking of this building. The only place is this message. Not just a representation of the message, not just a professing of this message, but someone that is drinking in &gt;&gt; what this prophet said &gt;&gt; and holding fast to it &gt;&gt; and letting that word become alive in you. &gt;&gt; Friends, dear friends, I want to close by saying this. This word actually can be activated and it falls into a heart that is falls down into the inner being and a person becomes you can feel them moving. You have to give time to it. &gt;&gt; You have to ponder it. You have to give time. You have to think about it. Let it go from the mind down to the heart. &gt;&gt; If it don't, it just becomes a it just becomes a mental belief. &gt;&gt; And church just becomes an activity. And you can have a school and you can have all these things and you can have a camp and go on and on and on. It's more than just having meetings. It's more than just special services. It's more it's more than all of these things. I just want to tell you if and and and if you will take this say I'm going to act upon that and I'm going to let that I'm I'm going to let the the words even if it's just one phrase. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it's just one phrase &gt;&gt; uh you read in a message and just one phrase. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I urge people there's brothers I've spoken to and ministers I've spoken to. They say, "Well, h how how do you know?" Well, sometimes this service just came as one phrase. There's a place &gt;&gt; by me. &gt;&gt; And I just begin to ponder. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a place. &gt;&gt; There's a place Moses is saying, I want to see your face. &gt;&gt; He's heard and he's talked to God and God's talked to him. What a man. What a place he's been in. And he said, "But I I want something more. I want to see your face. Maybe you can't catch it. It was reserved for this generation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They will see him &gt;&gt; face to face. &gt;&gt; The countenance and the shining countenance was for the last age. &gt;&gt; And I say to you, I announce to you as a congregation of people that God sent this messenger. That's why he was in such close proximity to him all the time. &gt;&gt; That's why, man. Listen to it. Go ahead. Go home. Get the get the prayer line tapes. You young people. Just listen to them. And then as you're listening, say, "Father, help me to grasp why you did this &gt;&gt; in my generation. You didn't do it with Martin Luther or or or or all of the other greats or Wesley. You didn't do it even by the apostles this way. You did it this. You didn't even do it yourself quite like this, but now you're doing it. [Music] &gt;&gt; I think people have missed it. Seriously. &gt;&gt; When they said, "Oh, well that's just a second pull." I can tell you they're in the third pull and they don't even have that. &gt;&gt; That wasn't just a second pull. That was his presence &gt;&gt; signifying that he was there present with the with and he wouldn't he he he wouldn't he wouldn't wherever he went. it was it was Houston or whether it was Bombay or whether it was Durban or Johannesburg or wherever it was to have a man to have a man just say how do you do friends I can't do anything until he comes &gt;&gt; well was that God there already yes that God was there &gt;&gt; another preacher could have said God is present But then when you have a a a a special vessel &gt;&gt; and listen, he's special not so we could make him special. He's special because God was doing it on your behalf. &gt;&gt; I want you to say that to yourself. God did this for me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They just say he's here. &gt;&gt; It was different from that moment on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sydney Jackson said in South Africa two 300,000 people he'd say he's here and he said just a somnity a sacred feeling a sacred atmosphere fell over that he said even the dogs and the animals where there's always the dog fights and things going on and because it's out in the open air and he said even the animals were totally silent &gt;&gt; you could hear a pin drop why is God a creation taking authority over every spirit of man, even over the animal kingdom, because now God was going to speak through his vessel to people in the name of Jesus Christ. Do not miss this service. Do not miss what I'm saying now. Take it with all seriousness and say, "Oh God, go home to your home. Drop down on your knees. Get alone with God." and saying, "Help me to get what brother Bisco was speaking of this morning. I want to I want to be saturated. I want to be permeated. I want, oh God, that divine presence &gt;&gt; to be my constant guide. &gt;&gt; And I honor you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We'll bow our heads. Heavenly Father, how how real you are, how marvelous you are. And you're not done. And we're not closing this service yet at this moment. But I pray that your spirit now, Father, begin to brood as you did in the first. You brooded and brooded until a beautiful lily came forward came up out of all of the muck and all of the mud. And we have all this environment. Lord, we go out of this place. We may go to a place to eat or we may go. There's that music and there's these images &gt;&gt; and here's this conversation &gt;&gt; and we just start feeling as though we're being soiled. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh God, hide us in the rock. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; May the people find a cliff in the rock. Lord, when you pass by, we'll not see the backward parts, but we'll see the Son of Man, in all of his glory, in all of his beauty, &gt;&gt; face to face &gt;&gt; with Christ, my savior. Oh, bless your name, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank you for this time together. And I pray again, Lord, with this congregation for the the our precious brothers and sisters that are returning back to Israel. May they go knowing they are there on a mission. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They are there, oh God, and all the powers of hell will be uh sailed against them. But we have no fear. &gt;&gt; Our confidence is in you. We've seen the devil try to attack, oh God. And we've seen you, as your prophet said, you should see him in battle one time. We've seen you in battle, oh God. We've seen such glorious victories. Hallelujah. Who wants to say hallelujah with me? Who wants to see glory to God? Come, Lord Jesus, come. Come, I pray. Meet the hunger and the thirst of the hearts, oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ. Your perfect will be done. Meet every need, Lord. There's some great needs. There's homes. There's great needs in homes. Oh God, take control. Take charge. Father, I I I I sense, Lord, that they're lifting up these requests to you even now. I'm praying with you, believers. I'm praying with you, saints. Go out and reach, oh God, these that may be uh doing their own thing today. Reach them for your word has said that the spirit of God when he's come, he will convict the world of sin. Convict these oh God, of unbelief. Convict them of the direction they're going. Turn them around &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Bring, I pray, Father, a sense of reality to them. Take the bl darkness and the blindness away. Oh God, will this congregation pray with me? &gt;&gt; We've got a number of people. We've got young men and women. We've got some homes. We've got some families. We need to see them delivered. Let's call on deliverance. You pray in your way. You pray in your way. You pray because brother Biscuit's making a request. Pray for some of these please in the Jesus name. I'm waiting for you to pray. &gt;&gt; Let the congregation pray. Call on God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May they find no no peace or satisfaction in the world. Oh God, let their next drink be a bitter one. Oh God, that do whatever needs to be done physically, even to their bodies. Cause their sleep to go from their eyes. Disturb them in the night time. Oh God, turn them I pray. Let this church become a praying church. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, let the will of the unbeliever be broken. Oh God, let it be broken. May the spirit of God break the stubborn will of man in the name of Jesus Christ. I take charge over every unbelieving spirit in the name of Jesus Christ against every critical spirit that the will and the word of God may have perfect liberty. Cleanse, oh God, with a holy fire, cleanse your children. Let there be a melting, oh father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Put a burden upon the hearts of the people, Lord. &gt;&gt; That they might enter into earnest prayer. &gt;&gt; Oh God, there's husbands that need you. &gt;&gt; Pray for these husbands, oh God, that need you. &gt;&gt; Wives that need you. &gt;&gt; Children that need you, oh God, because of what we've heard and what we've received.

[Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, this is what we pray about in our secret closet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord. &gt;&gt; This is what's been in our hearts, God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't want to just talk about living in your presence. We want it to be a reality, Jesus. Our hands are lifted up, Lord, because our words fall so short of what is in our hearts right now, Jesus, when we'd like to steal away and just be all alone with you and not speak before the crowds. [Music] But we must confess in the congregation that this is exactly what has been in our hearts, God. a groaning &gt;&gt; to be one in your presence. That our words and our hearts and our lives would live continuously, [Music] &gt;&gt; continuously. &gt;&gt; Not come in and go out, not come to a church address and hear a sermon or go to a camp or and then go live a different life. &gt;&gt; That's not our desire, God. We want it to be automatically and continually [Music] &gt;&gt; moment by moment, minute by minute. Lord, we are desiring that Jesus. And to have our pastor come and speak it, to have the other ministry labor in this channel of your will and your purpose, to have those ushering arms and wings of your spirit getting us into this place. God, we can only confess, Lord, your will be done, Jesus, as you've been beckoning, beckoning to us from the bedroom. Lord, we don't want to just talk about it. We don't want to just talk about a prayer life and not have it. We don't want to talk about a secret place and not have it. God, this is our moment. This is the hour, God, for your people to come into this place where it's you and us alone. Jesus, deliver us from churchianity, Lord, and complexes and spirits of the enemy, Satan trying to block it on every hand as we know this is the mind of the spirit. Help us to get into the channel, Jesus, of getting out of the way, God, and laying all the sin down at this altar. &gt;&gt; Lord, there will be a people &gt;&gt; that will know you and your power. Lord, where our heart is trembling right now because there will also be a people to claim this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And never experience it. And though they've been all around it and so close to it, you never knew them. Don't let that be one of us, Lord Jesus. God, help us, Lord. We know it's predestination. We know there's a seed and we believe that, God. Then there will be seed results, Lord, and there will be seed responses at the end time of your word. God, let the token be distributed to every life. We have a burden for our children, for our young people, for our families, lest we miss it. [Music] God, help us, Lord Jesus. May the Holy Ghost be in our hearts today. May our hearts go out of this building and go to where we live, where we work on an airplane, God, in our homes, Jesus, in our cars, God. May the personal presence of Jesus Christ, we're inviting you right now, God, [Music] &gt;&gt; come out of the pages, become a living manifestation in our lives, God, &gt;&gt; anoint the seed in our souls, Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; Let us tremble, God, in our homes, in our lives. Let the effects of your presence cause our mouths to be closed when words that ought not to be spoken are ready to come out. Lord, let a character of Jesus, let the nature of God get a hold of these hearts, God, when some are trying to get away, we're wanting to run too today. Lord, let it be recorded, Jesus, that we love your appearing and we'd want more of your word in our lives, God. It just seems like this service has no end. There's no period. There's no amen to it. We wanted to continue on this afternoon, God. You take our precious brother Tom, Lord, and use his gift, Lord, as is a hunger of our lives, Lord, to come into your presence more and more. And each one of these gifts, Lord, that get out of the way. Help us to get out of our way, God. And it gives us entrance into your very presence, Lord. We're hearing from our theophanes. [Music] &gt;&gt; Dear Jesus, soften our hearts with oil. Quiet us, Lord. Let us get into a place where we wait on you, Lord. Jesus God, we want to touch you, Lord. We want to reach out, Lord. [Music] Our brother Biscoll held up his hand, Lord, this morning. He was inches away from your prophet. Most of us never had that experience. But you have answered our questions. You've given us the answer. We have been face to face and our generation with the mighty angel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is our testimony. &gt;&gt; We are face to face with you right now, God. &gt;&gt; You are that close to us, Lord, and nearer. You are in our hearts. So go with us, Lord, to our homes and our places, God. May there not be frolic and foolishness. May there not be room for wrong decisions now. May there not be times, Lord, of of unbelief and sin, God. We people run out so quickly and in a few minutes it's it's like it's gone. Don't let that happen, God, and our promised land, Jesus. But let it so reach into our souls, Lord, that it'll become our daily meat, God, and our bread and our our food, Jesus. &gt;&gt; For we drink from you, and we can never be the same. Go with us now, God. We have many loved ones, and there's burdens many carry here. We carry them with us, Lord, until we see your supernatural hand outreach, God. We'll we'll continue to believe for the impossible. And our faith is in you, Jesus. Our faith is in your word, God. May this rapture anointing and your spirit that's upon your word within our hearts carry us, God. Continue to be with us as we go now. Go with every life, even on the internet, Jesus. those that are away from us or on the phone, hook up our friends, our family, and your elected seed go with them today, Jesus. And may every seed that is redeemable find a place, God, of yielding us to you. Bless our pastor and bless every life that's waited in this service and worshiped you. May our lives be a worship and may we live that amen in our actions, God. We commit this word to you today. Go with us now. And our visitors, God, and our precious friends from Israel, God, go with them, Jesus. &gt;&gt; May they win their land. May they fight for their inheritance. &gt;&gt; May they not give in &gt;&gt; to the powers of darkness that would fight against them. But as we also fight in our place, may we send them forth to fight in their place as overcomers &gt;&gt; under this great banner of the mighty angel that's come down. Bless us now as we go in Jesus precious name. Amen. [Music] We want to send you with God's blessings and especially to brother Roman, sister Julia. God give you safe journey. God bless you in Jesus name. You're all dismissed. God bless you. We'll see you at 5:00. Amen. [Music] [Music]
