We've got a testimony from Sister Renee AO. Wednesday night on the way home from church, a sharp pain started to develop in the right side of my chest. It got so bad I couldn't breathe normally and I could only sleep lying on my back. My husband Mark, my son Billy, prayed for me. And the testimony is that the pain left. Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to give the Lord thanks for that this morning. We want to remember to pray for brother assistant or I'm sorry, brother Chris and sister Tabitha Hall from Johnson City, Tennessee as their son Jonah has burned himself badly this morning and is in the hospital. So we want to remember that little one this morning. Brother Ernie wants us to remember the meetings in Sacramento that'll be taking place in the coming week. The Lord would have his way there as well. If you have a need upon your heart, would desire that the Lord would meet you. Ask and believe and it shall be even as you say. God bless you, brother DD.

And we pray you'll receive the fruit of our lips. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the acts of our lives. &gt;&gt; And dear Lord, now as we are about to open your word, truly no one but the Holy Ghost can interpret and make known this word. reveal to those to whom it's not been revealed as yet. I pray you'll quicken it to those that it has been revealed to. &gt;&gt; And may it be renewed once again. And may the life of it, oh God, be vibrant. May the first love be a flame in the bosom of every believer, oh God. I pray for all that are under the sound of my voice today, Lord. And that voice will do nothing except that you shall be the speaker. I pray, Father, by the Holy Spirit, the same spirit that came upon the 120 on the day of Pentecost and continued on through the New Testament era. Be present with us this morning. Oh Lord, we're depending on you. We're depending on you. We do not depend on the arm of flesh. We're depending entirely upon you. Bless now the people and I as I stand here at the post of duty. I pray that your uncction, oh God, will be our portion and anoint your word now to our hearts. Lord, I pray that every need, spiritual need that is that is essential and that is here this morning, feed the flock, oh great shepherd is our desire in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless you. Nice to see you all this grand day in the presence of God. Amen. Isn't he wonderful? He's been doing good things for us. &gt;&gt; For whereof we are glad. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to have you turn directly to the scripture if you would please to our text of Wednesday night. It's second Peter the first chapter. We'll read fewer verses. We started from verse 15 on Wednesday. I'm going to begin at verse 19 and later on we will go back to these scriptures. I have some uh PowerPoint slides I would like to refer to in a in a few moments but we'll just read this scripture. We have also a four um more sure word of prophecy where unto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts. Knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. And I think also we'll read first Peter. I referred to the scripture also on Wednesday, first scripture, 1 Peter the first chapter and verse 10 and 11. of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you, searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow. Amen. You may be seated. The Bible has many words that uh speak of being moved. Uh it speaks of being moved by afflictions, being moved with compassion. It's not the same word, a different word each time. being moved by uh some wind or something that would shake a person. they're being moved or being moved as it was when the chief priests moved the people to they motivated the people and we spoke a a good deal about that on on Wednesday and I would like to also bring that in if I may being moved by in by indignation those all different words but it's not the same as being moved by the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; as a completely different word and it has a completely different connotation. And so I'll just have them uh put slide one up. If you would please uh which is the scripture which we have just read. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. Now while you're holding that scripture in front of you, remember the second scripture which we uh quoted in fact is it is I think uh it's the fourth fourth slide. We'll just bring it up as well. Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently. Now we have the men who who spoke it searching diligently who pro these prophesied of the grace that should come and what they were searching for. They were searching what or what manner of time that the spirit of Christ which was in them. The spirit of Christ was in them and it was signifying it was testifying. It was speaking of the glories that should come and they they knew it. They could feel it, but they couldn't quite identify it. They didn't, you know, they they they couldn't define it. They just knew that it was there. It was laying there, but it was sealed up from them and yet it was such a reality. You know, I believe that believers believers are that way. We'll go back now to to the second slide two, please. So it says that they were moved by the Holy Ghost and now this movement because it relates directly to us. If we have received the word which we have and the revelation of the word which we speak about. This is not being moved is being shaken or being moved is being convinced or being moved by just a compassion. This is a different kind. There's a completely different connotation here that this is this is what the uh prophets of old what they experienced. They were being moved by a a a the spirit of God. And that spirit of God was a it it brought a burden to them. It it brought a burden to know that you know when you want to inquire about something when you don't know and you want to know and you intensely want to know it becomes a it becomes a burden to you. It becomes it's something that occupies your mind. You wake up with it in the morning. I need to know that I need especially when it was from the spirit of God. They just knew there was something out there. They just had to they were searching for it in the morning. They were searching throughout throughout one day to the next. It didn't make any difference. Although they may had a they they had to live, they had to eat, they had to work, they had responsibilities, but there was one thing that was occupying them. What is this wondrous thing that that God is witnessing, signifying within me? It's a reality. Is it for me? Is it for this time? Or what manner of time is it? But I need to really know. And God held it from them, but they never stopped wanting to know. And so it is a burden. The Bible speaks through Zachchariah the burden of the word of the Lord. The Bible speaks Malachi prophesied and he and he begins it. The burden of the word of the Lord. You see the word of the Lord which we receive does not come uh without a weight. There's a there's a responsibility to it to begin with. We become a responsible people when we receive the word of the Lord. And so this being moved is not a movement as such being motivated as such that way but it is something that is it's a movement within uh the individual to bring forth something and we do not maybe know what the full consequence or the result to carry some burden to bear with oneself and to be uh moved inwardly and I like this last word and that's why I highlighted and underlined it promise. ed an impulse motivated. There's something that motivates a person and we don't always understand our actions as a result of that motivation. We spoke of uh people who are highly motivated, people who are uh are they're mediocre about things, but they're not highly motivated. And we hear we hear these these kind of comments which we're are familiar with. Now, I like to just go to slide three. if you would please. Because the now the prophet in trying to do God a service, he speaks of the ark of the Lord and how it was to be carried was on the shoulders of his ministers. His ministers was the Levites uh put it up put it up over their left shoulder and packed that ark like that because it was up over their heart. They had the burden of the word on their heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so we can just take that off for a moment. They had the Now, that's that's what the messenger said, and I trust you believe that. &gt;&gt; Now, you are here this morning and you have a certain area of responsibility. You have a certain burden. Everybody's in a different capacity. They have Everybody has a different post of duty. But we all have a post of duty. You believe that? Every person here, I don't care how young you are, whatever God makes known to you, you have a post of duty, you have a a responsibility to be a witness. You have a responsibility to manifest the the word that God is has placed in your heart. You have a responsibility and that's that's not that's not just some light uh thing, but that is a serious matter. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I stand here this morning, you know, we come to the pulpit even after 45, 50 years now of of being behind pulpits still trembling. You tremble not because of the people, but you tremble at the responsibility. &gt;&gt; Just think of a person. I I was on on my mind it on my mind uh uh often. What would Brother Brand says? Well, you know, the people that are before him, he loves them. Well, how would you lead them astray? Uh, you know, intentionally, what a responsibility to say something wrong and uh misdirect to life. My, what would that be in in in the other dimension in another eternity in eternity, it's such a responsibility. And so, a person, you know, each one of us. And so the burden of the word of the Lord, I stand here, you sitting there, you have your responsibility, I have my responsibility, but the burden of the word of the Lord was to be carried on the shoulders of the ministry. And God in God holds him accountable for that. And so I I trust that you understand that's the way it was. And brother Brandham said that in doing God a service without his will, as I said to you also on Wednesday. And I'm just covering a couple of the things from that service. We had a good time, didn't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. But he was talking to the businessmen because the Christian businessmen international felt that they could do the job. The ministry had failed. The ministry had divided the church all up into a into a whole lot of uh uh denominational uh you know, segregated them out and divided them up. And brother Brandham was was for them on that one on that one aspect to bring them together and and and let the walls of that divided them uh let them disappear. And he said when the you know when the when the ducks are in their various pens, they're all divided up. But when the water rises high enough, then they all mingle together and the fences are all gone. And so he was 100% for them. And he said he had opened up many chapters for them because there were certain aspects that he was very much in favor of. But being all divided up, he wasn't in favor of that at all. And so, but they they went over the boundary of their responsibility. They were businessmen. They had the money. They could do the things. And uh and so they said the ministry failed. We'll do it. And that's why he preached this message. It can't go on the shoulders of businessmen. &gt;&gt; It had to go on the shoulders of those that had the burden of the word of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So, we can take that slide down, please. Thank you. And uh in the invisible union, just laying some foundation here as we move through. Invisible union of the bride. He said, "Would you imagine Peter, James, and John going before a psychiatrist?" Now, he's talking about those that handle the word of the Lord. Would you could you imagine Peter, James, and John going before a psychiatrist? because some organizations were requiring their ministry before they send them out, before they put them into ministry to go before a psychiatrist. He said, "Remember that 120 up there, they couldn't even sign their own names. Standing before a psychiatrist to see if their reflex was just right and so forth, he said they had a reflex, but it wasn't an intellectual conception or scientific research. It was through the power of God. They were motivated. They had an impulse. They had a reflex. They were motivated by the power of God. These men who who spoke the scripture, they were moved by the Holy Ghost. They spoke things they didn't realize. They did things that were strange to them, but they did it under the impulse of the Holy Spirit. There are some powers that are uh I would guess are all inclusive completely inclusive of all humanity. One of those is gravity. &gt;&gt; We're all subject to gravity. &gt;&gt; There isn't anybody here isn't subject to gravity. &gt;&gt; And it's very very rare when Enoch and Elijah became free of gravity. The Lord Jesus was free of gravity. But as far as humanity is concerned, we're all subject to gravity. That's one of the powers. And then the prophet comes and says, there's only two powers in the world. There's only two powers. The power of God and the power of Satan. &gt;&gt; The power of life and the power of death. And so this morning, I can say with authority, &gt;&gt; Amen. Every person here is being moved by one of those two powers. &gt;&gt; And you may not realize it. There are a lot of people being moved by the power of death that doesn't realize it. They think I'm having a great time. Oh, this is so uh this is so, you know, uh fulfilling to the flesh, but it's just the flesh. &gt;&gt; This is so satisfying. This is so gratifying. This is such a stimulating stimulating thing, but it's all death. &gt;&gt; And then there are believers that are going through grinding times, difficult times. Have you had it? &gt;&gt; Oh, we're going to talk about it this morning. Going through times and they say, "What's happening?" &gt;&gt; You've said it. &gt;&gt; Sure you have. What's going on? &gt;&gt; You've said it. &gt;&gt; Oh, all of us have. This isn't what I expected. my Lord, I need you now. And yet, they didn't realize it, but even the spirit of life, they're being moved by the spirit of life. It wasn't death. It's not death that's moving the believer. It's life that's moving us this morning. I can announce to you this morning, every believer, uh, the bornagain believer, the word of God, is being moved this morning by the Holy Spirit. You came into this service this morning moved &gt;&gt; by God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It wasn't the devil that brought you here. &gt;&gt; That is absolutely true. &gt;&gt; And yet anything that's contrary to the word is death. And there's a lot of people sitting in pews, in churches, in buildings, and in various places of gatherings. And they and they actually believe we're here by God's will for life and actually death is on the road. &gt;&gt; Death has moved them. &gt;&gt; Death has actually moved them because it's a deception. It's contrary to the word. I I've I've had people I've been in churches I've been in gatherings when you when they started out and it was just worship and oh they waved their hands and clap like you clap raise their hands like you raised their hand and then soon as I mentioned being baptized in the water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they become downcast &gt;&gt; immediately. So is it life that was moving them or death that's moving them? And the scripture tells us that the man of sin will even set himself up in the temple of God to be worshiped of God. And I guarantee you if he does that, there are those that are worshiping him. And the scripture tells us in Revelation that all all a ll whose names are not in the book of life will worship the beast. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say hallelujah because that's all part of the plan of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he says he spoke of those in the upper room. It was through the power of God. He says, "And when it struck them, they knew nothing to do but act out what the Holy Ghost said &gt;&gt; to do." &gt;&gt; Amen. They didn't pay any attention to any intellectual. What the church said, what the priest said, and what this said and that said, they move by the spirit. Fearless men. &gt;&gt; That was it then and that is it today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Fearless men, fearless women. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now some of these powers which I said earlier seem to be all inclusive. The power of the grave to this time is largely every person is subject to it. Many have tried to escape it. And many today, of course, we're occupied with living as long as we can. But eventually, outside of a change of this body and the rapture of the living church, outside of that, the grave is all inclusive. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, David cried out in Psalms 49 and 15. He said, "But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave, for he shall receive me." And the uh Paul says in Hebrews, for as much as then, for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also uh likewise took part of the same that through death, he might destroy him that had the power of death. Now, if he destroys him who has the power of death, then the power of death will cease to exist. And the scripture says that this is why Christ came and he took part of the same. We are partakers of flesh. He became a partaker of flesh and blood and and he and through death he went through death that he might destroy him who had the power of death. I thank you. I thank the Lord today that I can say to you there are some things which are potential our our eternal life. We are uh we already possess it. But there are many things incorporated or included in eternal life which presently are potential for us. There's there's those of the unbelieving. Satan, he's already potentially in a lake of fire. &gt;&gt; He's already potentially destroyed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In 1 Corinthians also 1:18, it said, "For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God." I want to say to this listening congregation this morning, &gt;&gt; the power of God for the believer, &gt;&gt; and you must include yourself or exclude yourself from it, but I include myself. Do you include yourself? &gt;&gt; The power of God is all inclusive to every believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The power of God is all inclusive to every believer. Now, Paul was speaking in his own defense before King Agria. I love I love Paul's comments. Oh, you ought to read it sometime. Maybe you'd like to read it this afternoon. Acts in the 26th chapter. You might want to turn to Acts 26. We're going to uh read a few verses there. But he was relating how this great light and whose brightness was greater than the sun and that a voice spoke out of the light and that he Paul should go to the Gentiles. This is what he was relating to King Agria. And he says in verse 14, Acts 26, "And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks." And I said, "Who art thou, Lord?" And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest, but rise and stand upon thy feet, for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of those things in which I will appear unto thee. Just stop there for a moment. Hold your place. If you were to read the account of this happening that that Paul is now relating, if you read it in Acts the 9th chapter where it happened, none of these words appear there. &gt;&gt; Paul is actually giving King Agria a more complete picture &gt;&gt; of what happened. Even these words do not appear there. Paul is saying things to a grippa that God said to him at that day and this is the only place they actually appear this. But rise and stand upon thy feet. For I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister, and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in which I will appear unto thee, delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee to open their eyes. And now listen, this is the verse I want you to notice. To open their eyes. This is why God was going to send Paul to the Gentiles to open their eyes and turn them from the darkness of light, from the darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. &gt;&gt; You know, friends, I I I'm just consumed this morning to think that God Almighty would take one man, &gt;&gt; Paul the Apostle, and tell him, "I'm sending you to the Gentiles." The very man who was who was obsessed. He was just obsessed to take every Christian and cast them into jail. And he says that he cast many into jail. He cast them into prison. He was hunting them down. And here God took that man. You talk about turning a person around. Turn him around from a from a a a a persecutor of the church and a renegade as he were. Turn him completely around and made him an apostle. And not only that, he says to open the eyes to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God. One man was being sent now and he was going to spearhead the movement of the early church. Think of the ministry that thing now that was no wonder he was so gripped. He was being moved by a spirit that was in him and that was going to turn actually turn the Gentiles from darkness to light and release them from the power of Satan unto God. The church, friends, the believer has, and I'm speaking of I'm speaking to believers today, has power &gt;&gt; over Satan. &gt;&gt; Power over darkness. &gt;&gt; And I think I should say, don't forget it. &gt;&gt; We have power. &gt;&gt; It's something that's moving. You don't feel it always, but it's something that's moving. We're being moved by the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost can never never be subject to Satan. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost can never be subject to the spirit of darkness. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is life. &gt;&gt; And we are being moved by life. &gt;&gt; I want to announce that to you irrevocably. We're being moved by the power of life. &gt;&gt; Eternal life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Turn to be converted. Now there's a quote and this one I want you to listen very very closely to and I'll appreciate your undivided attention. In the fifth seal, brother Bram speaks about Polycarp. And on his uh road coming down, he was talking. He said he was walking with his head down. And the Roman centurion was saying to Polyarp, "You're an old man and you're well respected. Why don't you denounce the thing?" He just kept looking towards heaven and a voice spoke from somewhere. They couldn't understand where and said, "Poly carp, &gt;&gt; don't fear. I'm with you." &gt;&gt; Why? He was standing by that word. And when they begin to pile the wood, the boards on him to burn him, there was a heavenly music that came down and the anthems from some angelic somewhere singing songs. He never even one time batted an eye to them. That's gallant men. That's men who can stand. And now I want this the fifth slide up because this is the next part of this quote. The martyrs down through the ages. They suffered terribly. But what were they? They were under the inspiration, the spirit of God, the power. And don't forget this church. Please don't forget this church. How could man do anything else besides the power of God that had been released to them? And I am not talking about the martyrs now. They had their day. &gt;&gt; They had and sometimes death would actually be preferred over life. I can tell you friends, it is more difficult to live day after day and week after week and month after month and year after year with the forces of this power and that influence and the world and the oppression and the evil and the temptation and the sin that's everywhere and the sickness and the disease. disease and the death and everything that's around us. It is easier, it's preferable many times to say if they said deny this or die, you just say let me die &gt;&gt; and you're out of it and you cross over and you're gone home. But to fight with it every day, every day, every day. But I say I said I'll tell you my friends, the prophet still said this was the golden age. &gt;&gt; And there's not many going to come out of it victorious. But there are some. And the reason why they'll come out victorious, I want you to hear it and hear it good. Is because there has been a power &gt;&gt; released upon the church &gt;&gt; for this hour &gt;&gt; and they can do nothing else. We can respond no other way. We can only respond according to the power that's been released to us. &gt;&gt; And I guarantee you, God has not brought us here to this time to have a defeated church. She's a glorious church. The Bible says without spot and without wrinkle or any such thing. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; He says they couldn't do nothing else. &gt;&gt; On in the fifth seal as well, he said if God sends a certain spirit among them, that's the only thing that they can work by. &gt;&gt; If God sends a certain spirit, that's the only thing they can work by. &gt;&gt; God has sent a spirit in this end time. It is different from other times. The same spirit but a different intensity, a different capacity to achieve a different thing. I say God has sent a spirit that witnesses within the believer today that this is the third exodus. That this is the resurrection time, that this is the rapture time, that this is a time when when the bodies of men and women will experience a sweep of some kind, and they'll be changed in their atoms from mortal to immortality. That's what the spirit says within us. And we can do nothing else than be moved by that which has been released at this time. &gt;&gt; It's a resurrection time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We can do nothing else &gt;&gt; than act &gt;&gt; according to the spirit that's been released. If God hadn't released it, that's why I read the scripture in in first Peter. the the prophets, they prophesied of it and they searched what manner and of time what what manner and what manner of time that this should come and they spoke of the glories that should take place, the grace that should come to us and they desired to know. Brother Brandham says continuing in the fifth seal, he says, "We'll prove to you by the history of the church and by the opening of the seals and the powers that let loose." He said, "And watch exactly the church responded to the anointing and they couldn't do nothing else." &gt;&gt; You're here. You've been motivated by something. We haven't come here simply because we know someone or we have a certain uh uh a certain association. My friends are there. That's not why we're here. My parents are there or my children are there. That's not if that's what motivates us. That's as far as it goes. But there's a people that are in the land today that are being motivated by the anointing that has been released to us &gt;&gt; at this hour. &gt;&gt; And it's a victorious power. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; You may not always be and more than likely you won't be, you know, just dancing about and feeling, you know, jubilant as such because it's a battle. &gt;&gt; It's a real struggle. &gt;&gt; But I have to announce to you, I feel called to tell you today that we can do nothing other than than act and be motivated by the spirit that's been released to us. And I can tell you a spirit has been released. &gt;&gt; God sent a messenger to release the spirit of that word. &gt;&gt; See, he sends a word. He holds it back, &gt;&gt; but then he he releases the word at a certain season and then the Holy Spirit comes to make that word for that season come alive. &gt;&gt; And there is no other way for it to happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us of the 120, the Bible says there were above, that's more than 500 people who heard the words of Jesus after he was resurrected. &gt;&gt; And the instructions go to Jerusalem and carry there for the Holy Spirit until you be endued with power from on high. Of the 500, more than 500, 380 found other responsibilities and they were motivated to tend to their things while 120 were motivated to go and sit and do nothing. &gt;&gt; And wait for a for 10 days. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And maybe there was no feeling, but they thought maybe I got it. Brother Brand says of I believe Peter, maybe I got it. No, no, it wasn't yet. But when it came &gt;&gt; and they were not there, Jesus notice did not instruct the disciples or anyone in a special way like I would maybe say, "Brother Dy, you be brother John, you be sure and be there." The deacons, uh, you be sure and be there. This is very important. Jesus, he just, he just threw the word out, &gt;&gt; and those that had received the word were there. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit didn't come to Peter, James, and John. The Holy Spirit came to the word &gt;&gt; and they that had the word, they that had the word could do nothing else but respond. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're not here because we just feel we're certain class of people. We're here because God has sent a word and that word has shed a light in our hearts and we can do nothing else and act upon that word. &gt;&gt; There's something within us. And we can't explain it. &gt;&gt; We're a driven people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're driven. &gt;&gt; For and against. &gt;&gt; There are things in this world I can't stand. &gt;&gt; There's things in this world that really are difficult for us as believers. Goes against us. It's hard, &gt;&gt; but there are things that we know we've been called to do and we must do it and we will do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Turn to Acts the 10th chapter. in Acts the 10th chapter. I just referred to it and some of you may have read it referred to it Wednesday. The account is this because I'm just going to read just a very very little bit of it. But I want to give you the first account. The account of it is this that Cornelius the centurion of the Italian band. Don't don't forget that he was over a hundred men in the in the Roman army. The army which had taken Jesus under their possession and with their leaders had brought him to the cross. Don't forget it's his army that guarded the tomb. He's a member of this army of Rome. But he's a godly man. &gt;&gt; He does something the rest of the army doesn't do. He prays always &gt;&gt; and he's a giver of arms. And all when they Lord came and spoke to him and said, "Your arms and your prayers have come up for remembrance before God," he perhaps didn't ever realize that that's what was happening. But an angel came to him and said, "Send men to Japa and called for one, Simon Peter." He's at Simon the Tanner's house. And he sent men to them. And Peter had just had a vision and he saw this sheet coming down with all kinds of animals and fowl and creeping things in it. And a voice said, "Rise up, Peter. Take an eat." And he said, "I've never touched an unclean thing to my lips." And it came three times. And then immediately there's men at the door to receive him and to bring a message and to tell him about Cornelius that they've been sent. So Peter goes with them the next day on the marorrow. The Bible says Peter went with them and certain brethren from Japa and accompanied them. And I'm going to go on down to the 40 uh I guess we'll go down to about verse 32. And uh Cornelius now is speaking. He's speaking 4 days ago. Verse 30. I was fasting until this hour. Verse 32. Send therefore uh to Japa and call thither hither Simon whose surname is Peter. He is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the seaside who when he cometh shall speak unto thee. Immediately therefore I sent to thee and thou hast well done that thou art come. Notice these words. Now therefore are we all here present before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God. This man when he saw Peter he was so filled with respect. Here's Peter uh ignorant fisherman as he were. He's and all that Cornelius knows is that a one in shining clothing has come to him and said call for this man. He had such respect to that experience. He fell down to worship Peter. And Peter took him up. Said, "Don't worship me. I'm a man also." But he he's got exactly the right desire. He said, "We are all present." And the Bible says that he had gathered his friends. He gathered those that he had influence over. He was so confident. He was so filled with expectation that something was going to happen to him. And the Bible says, "And Peter opened his mouth and said, "Of a truth, I perceive that God," this verse 34, "is no respect of person, but in every nation, he that fearth him and workketh righteousness is accepted of him." And then he goes on into the account of Christ, and go down to verse 43. To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name, whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins. And while Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all of them which heard the word, and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. For they heard them speak with tongues or languages, and magnify God. And then answered Peter, Can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord and then prayed they him to tarry certain days. The Bible says that the Holy Ghost fell upon them. I was I was impressed with this and I wanted to go a little further, a little deeper into it. This fall, it wasn't just that they had this uh you know this sudden momentary thing, but the Holy Ghost fell upon them. The word is the Holy Ghost seized them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost took control of them. &gt;&gt; It fell upon them. &gt;&gt; Amen. and took possession of him. He took possession of him that they would then continue to be used. And it says it took him in his in the to be used of the Holy Spirit in his inspiration and his impulse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope that you are following along with me. It wasn't just something just fell and they they spoke in other languages and other tongues. It wasn't that. It was indeed more than that. The Holy Spirit seized them. &gt;&gt; You know, we got a few hundred people here and many more on the internet this morning listening live. It may well be that the Holy Spirit hasn't seized a person. When it when you're seized, you'll understand it as we go on through the scripture and through the service this morning. You may not feel I can believe that one uh a person can be actually baptized and filled with the Holy Spirit. I'm not talking about the gift of the Holy Spirit. I'm talking about the Holy Spirit himself. Now, the person of the Holy Spirit and then you can go through reversals and you go through difficulty and you begin to question your own mind. And I I also have that quote right here. Brother Bam says, "Don't do that. That's the devil's language. Don't say I'm weak. Don't say I can't do it. Oh, I wonder if this and I wonder if that. You know that God seized you. But there are others may perhaps at no time in your life did the Holy Spirit actually sees you, &gt;&gt; take control of you. &gt;&gt; How do you know? Well, one way you'll know is because there's something that's continually within you, &gt;&gt; driving you forward, &gt;&gt; and you you have this that we spoke of a few moments ago. You can do nothing else than keep forging ahead when you can see no light at the end of the tunnel. There's no way to turn, but there's something inside. There's something within you that's driving you on to your ultimate goal. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; That's the spirit that's been released upon this generation. maybe others and it hasn't happened to you. I say you should not delay. You should not set that aside. Don't push it aside. You say, "Oh God, you that sent this spirit upon the early church and you have released a special allotment." And I going to come to that a special allotment at this time. you have assigned &gt;&gt; to this generation. &gt;&gt; How many believe the seals have been opened? &gt;&gt; How many believe the mysteries been revealed? &gt;&gt; Then that means God has has exposed has made known uh of his word which is a lifegiving word. Now he's opened it up not to become mental information. He's opened it up for the purpose that a people who have been born in the in a human community and raised to this. You've been born like Elijah was born. You've been born like Moses was born. You've been born like the early church was born. You're born like the men and women who are here when Jesus walked here. &gt;&gt; You're no different. &gt;&gt; You had a mother or father and you issued out into the world. And you came at this season. At this season when God would make known. So God released his word. &gt;&gt; He made known things that were not previously known. &gt;&gt; They were held back. People desired to know. They couldn't know. God held it back. And he released the word not to become mental information. But there was a people that were born in this age. &gt;&gt; And they were ordained of God to hear what had been released. Furthermore, they've been elected by God, chosen, and predestinated for this hour to receive that word which is spoken. &gt;&gt; And when they received that word in faith, the Holy Ghost came down upon that word &gt;&gt; and made that word to start to be thrust through, begin to manifest, begin to move itself through those people. And maybe they didn't realize what they're doing. Didn't realize what they're saying. They just couldn't realize it. Uh never thought they would do those things. &gt;&gt; And while Peter spake these words, the Holy Ghost, I want to say, seized them. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost took possession of them. &gt;&gt; I have testimony after testimony. We could stay all afternoon here. I look over this audience and see uh and look into your faces. I know the testimony of many here and how they fought. Hey, you know, brother brother Johnny Stemon, he's not here. He's pastor down in Florida. I was preaching in a house and his wife was sitting in the in the little group in the house and Johnny Stemon was unbeliever and he walked by the house. He told me and he laughs about it now. He said, "I shook my fist at that place. I was so angry. My wife was in there." &gt;&gt; And he said, "I uprooted her and moved the whole family to California." Said, "I'm getting away from this thing." Oh, he's just like a little bit of Apostle Paul. I'm going to fight this thing with everything that's in me. Shake my fist and say all kinds of nasty things. And God turned him around. I tell you what, God had him by the scuff of the neck and say, "Listen here, little boy. You're going to do what I got planned for you. &gt;&gt; You're going to be a pastor. &gt;&gt; You're going to shepherd some of my sheep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, how I thank God some of you here how you fought it. Oh, how it wasn't for you. Now, that's not for me. I can I can just see it. &gt;&gt; Ah, yeah. You're running your own life. No, you aren't running your own life. God's got a hold of every one of his children. He's going to bring them through one knot hole, two knot holes, or three, but he'll bring you through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God sees them. It fell upon them. He took possession of them and use them and they began to be under the inspiration and the impulse &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. in the message beginning and ending of the gentile dispensation. Isn't this isn't that quite a title? The beginning and the ending of the gentile disper dispensation kind of takes us in there, doesn't it? And he says it's just the same tonight. I wonder what a man I wonder what would happen if a man here tonight had the power to strike a cross around and say, "Look, standing around this tabernacle tonight." He says, "You'd be a member here the rest of your life." He he's making reference to something he just said before. He said sometime when you can't see it with your natural eyes but you can feel the impulse of it something near a sixth sense that denotes that something is near. &gt;&gt; There's a sixth sense that denotes it testifies that something is near. I'm wanting to make you more sensitive to something than more than just what's in front of us &gt;&gt; or what's beside us. The scripture says, "While we look not at the things which are seen," you were here Wednesday. Those of you that were here said, "If we look at the things which are seen, just the things that are seen, there's a lot here that could make us very negative people &gt;&gt; as a believer." as a believer. Now to those that are in the world, it's it's their diet. &gt;&gt; That's what they live on. &gt;&gt; They don't have anything else, I guess. And some of them are, you know, really void and vacant inside, but it's their diet. So, they party on the weekend and any other time they can and do their drugs and have their sports and do all of the things that are pleasurable to them. And I don't I don't I don't knock them for that. That's the best they got. &gt;&gt; An old brother used to say to me, old brother Mcgriff used to say about the world, said that's the best they got. &gt;&gt; That's the best they're ever going to have. &gt;&gt; Going to have their case of beer and go out for the weekend and drag all of their things with them, drag their boom boxes with them, and drag their televisions with them. make a big mess out in the out in the woods and they might as well stayed home because they just dragged everything from home out there. &gt;&gt; All they got away from that I can say is they got away from mowing the lawn. &gt;&gt; They just go out there and booze it up. And he says that's the best they're ever going to have. &gt;&gt; He says and just think this is the worst we're ever going to have. &gt;&gt; Just think it's the worst we're ever going to have. You say, "Well, it's tough, but it's the worst you're going to have. is only getting better. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's God's promise. &gt;&gt; And he says you can feel something near. It denotes or it it's it's something near you. And he said, "Watch them this morning." So many things that were happening at that time. And we all understand what it is to be motivated. Uh you perhaps don't know what's motivating you right now. Lots of things are motivating the people. Brother Brham says what went out for to see. He said, "Then when a then if a man or a woman," he said, "your anointing tells on you, whatever your spirit is moves you, and you're motivated by a spirit." And if the spirit of Christ is on the Christians, the believer, no wonder he's a peculiar person. No wonder there's something moving in him because God is in him. The spirit of Christ is motivating him and he has to move as the spirit moves him. &gt;&gt; Now different things motivate different people. I could say so much about that. But I want to speak about the brother Bram talks about the token and I was going to pass over this but I don't feel I should. It's here for somebody. He said, "Here's what you want to believe for. You want to believe you want your own safety. &gt;&gt; You believe for your safety." Then apply the token for the whole family. You say, "How can I do that?" Now, parents, mothers, fathers, here's an answer. How can I do that? He said claim it. He said if it worked on you then you and the word becomes one. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said and see it works for both of you. You and the word become one. You and the word are one. He says again. Then apply it to your children. Apply it to your loved ones. like Rahab did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She applied the token. And I thought today before I read on, Cornelius was one in the New Testament and Rahab was one in the Old Testament. Listen friends, these two are critical examples for us today because I would say if I asked for hands, which I will not, but I believe there'd probably be close to 100% of the adults in this assembly that would like to raise their hand for someone. The prophet is saying, "You became one with the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You claim it. Now for the others, the Bible says of Cornelius that he and his household, he believed for his household that they would be saved. And we're all here, he said, to hear words of thee. The two spies said to Rahab, "You gather everyone, your brothers, your sisters, your mother, your father, and this harlot brought them into her house, and everyone in her house were preserved." &gt;&gt; God did not go in to find out are they worthy, did they do this, were they bad people, were they good people? He said nothing about that. He said, "If you bring them in under this token," in other words, you have made a covenant with God. You've made a covenant. God is regarding that covenant. You bring them in under this covenant and I will respect you. Keep your word, I'll keep my word, and they will be saved. &gt;&gt; No one will come to destruction. Isn't that marvelous? &gt;&gt; I believe other groups have tried to duplicate that and uh and and whatever more. We're not interested what other groups have done. We've got a vindicated message. &gt;&gt; And he says Rahab did. She applied the token to her father. She applied it to her mother. She applied it to her brothers and sisters and got them all in. He said, "You apply it. Say, Lord, I'm going after my son. I'm going after my daughter. I claim her. Satan, you turn her loose. I'm coming after her. I apply my token. The Holy Spirit, oh, Holy Spirit that lives within me, catch my daughter there. I'm going out. I'm going to her now with your anointing upon me. And he will do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How long should we say it? Say it over and over. &gt;&gt; Say it until you believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Say it out loud. &gt;&gt; As we say on the quote Wednesday, say it over and over. Say it again. Say it out loud. Speak it. And continue it until you believe it. &gt;&gt; You know that's powerful &gt;&gt; because if a person doesn't really believe it, it's so hard to say it. &gt;&gt; So hard to say it. &gt;&gt; But you say it. harmonize with the word of God &gt;&gt; and say it over and over and say it out loud &gt;&gt; and say it until you believe it. All right, I'm going to read some scripture here in a moment. that I'd like to have you turn with me to Hebrews. I have two places I want to read yet. Hebrews the 11th chapter and we're going to just look at verse 24. By faith, Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt. For he had respect under the recompense of the reward. And by faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, for he endured. And here's the last phrase, as seeing him who is invisible. I have taken I looked at this scripture carefully and I want you all to listen very closely because I know what our lives are like. I have good knowledge of it. I experience it every day myself. And I'm I'm very conscious that if I become or if we become uh dictated to or guided by the things that we see, it's impossible for us to live victorious lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; I said it quietly, but I think you understand what I'm saying. If we see the things that we see, the things that we're affected by, if if if we see and and what we see are really negative things. The world is a negative place. Oh, people have a front. They have a facade, but because you're a believer, you see through it. and you see through it and you say that's not real. &gt;&gt; You see all this giddy laughing and joke and so on. They're not fooling anybody. &gt;&gt; See all this hilarity and you know everything and oh we're going to go and have a great time. You know they're not going to have a great time. &gt;&gt; You see the way people conduct themselves. You see the way people dress. You see the way they speak. You see the things they do. And for the believer, it's a very unwelcome place. &gt;&gt; And so, we see all of those things. Then, if we don't walk by faith and we see things that we've prayed for, things that we've desired, and we see this kind of go sideways, and we see that person go this way, and we see this friendship dissolve, we see this relationship turn sour, we see all these things. We come here into the house of God, and and you know, this is this is our best time. none of you should even come into the house of God and this one rubs me the wrong way and that one doesn't shake my hand and all all those are negative things but those are all things that you happen to be seeing in the visible world &gt;&gt; now friends I can tell you that this prophet messenger brother Brandham's life the thing that you so rejoice in did not come because a man looked at what he saw around is a man who looked into the unseen realm. &gt;&gt; And I I I just put down what what Moses what Paul has spoken of Moses and what he did. The Bible says that he refused. He refused. Now, here are some words I'm going to just deal with and then I'm going to go to one other scripture. In verse 24, he refused. In verse 25, he chose. In verse 26, he esteemed and he had respect under the recompense. In verse 27, he forsook Egypt. He was In verse 27 also, he did not fear. In verse 27 also, he endured. In verse 21, 28 rather, he kept the Passover. And verse 29, by faith they passed through the Red Sea on dry land. He did all of those things because he saw him who was invisible. &gt;&gt; He refused. In other words, he had the right balance. &gt;&gt; Hey, I just think about this. I never really thought about it before. Yesterday, I was thinking about this. He refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter. a woman who had him taken up &gt;&gt; and who loved him and cared for him and provided for him and wanted him to become the pharaoh &gt;&gt; wanted him to become the president, the king, the pharaoh of the superpower of the earth. And he came because he saw he had an impulse in him and he felt connected to something that was in another realm. And that impulse caused him to look at these mud &gt;&gt; dobbers &gt;&gt; and say, "They're my brothers &gt;&gt; and they're my sisters." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The impulse that was in him caused him to look upon him who was invisible. And by seeing him invisible, he had his eyes fixed there. I refuse to be called the son of this woman. I refuse the grandeur and the power that his flesh would have liked to have accepted. I refuse it because he had his eyes in the right place and he did not fear. His fear left him and he chose because he had his eyes. He began to choose every one of us. I am I'm in constant I have to say myself I'm in constant concern over the congregation, over my friends, over my family. I'm in constant concern over the choices they make, over our young people. I just I pray I hope I trust to make the right choices because I know choices are so critical and the choices well you know when our choices when our choices come what do we base it on well we look at this and we look at that we look at this possibility we look at that we look at the paycheck we look at the education we look at the skills we look at what the potential is we look at what it's going to do for me and the whole thing is material material material material Quite frankly, I realize that we've got to take those things into consideration. But what should we really be looking at? We should be looking at him who's invisible. &gt;&gt; We should say, you say, "How do I do that, Brother Ed?" I say, "You, Almighty God, that brought this word, you that sent this phenomenal ministry, you I see you You sent it down. Even against the will of the man who spoke it. You sent it down. Somehow it went in its network and it reached me. I see you. You're the one that's going to guide me. &gt;&gt; You're the one that's going to tell me what to do. I'll make this choice, but if you direct me another way, I'm prepared to go another direction. I'm prepared. Whatever it is, I'm prepared to go your way. I'm looking at the invisible. Are you folks with me this morning? I'm looking at the invisible. &gt;&gt; I'm going to make my choices based on the invisible. &gt;&gt; You brought this word to me, Lord. You know, I I'm just going to tell you some personal things. Going to be careful to close soon. Up till just this last week, I have wondered why. And I've said to you, I've said to you here in this congregation, I do not know why I'm so affected when I hear what we call the second pull, the revealing of the secret of the heart of the people that all my life has gripped me so deeply. I'm so affected by it. And I will listen to the tape and my ear is there and I begin to weep and I say so often I know it's God. I feel him. I feel that impulse &gt;&gt; and I say why why did you do this? Why did you do this? &gt;&gt; What is the whole purpose of this? I know we could say well it's to attract the people, gather the people. But I see that demonstration over and over and over and I can hear that little prophet behind the pullpit and you can feel the atmosphere is filled with animosity and indignation and even hatred and yet he plows ahead and keeps preaching it, keeps preaching it. Why? is almost like a torturous thing he's going through especially towards the end and then he'll come at the end and start to call someone would it help you if I tell you your name Mrs. Holt. I was listening again. He was just coming to it. He said, "We're going to have the prayer line." You know what he said? Blessed me. He said, "The revealing of the secret of the heart is a greater miracle than if a got up out of the wheelchair." &gt;&gt; He said, "A might get up out of a wheelchair by mental faith." &gt;&gt; But he said, "You can never reveal the secret of the heart that way." It was God said, "It's a greater miracle." And I began to realize that God was there was an impulse within me. There's a greater miracle. God demonstrated for this people. And when you say within your heart, when you can say this morning, there's an unseen. There's an unseen realm and that realm has anchored in my heart. God has seized me. &gt;&gt; I've been seized. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've been taken into a grip. Something fell upon me and I cannot change it. &gt;&gt; That's a glorious thing. &gt;&gt; You got the same thing Moses had. &gt;&gt; I cannot I refuse things because I see the unseen. I choose things because I see the unseen. I endure things because I see the unseen. Hallelujah. the same spirit that was upon him. I esteem things because I see the unseen. I have forsaken things because I've seen the unseen. I've kept the Passover. We've kept the feast. We kept the we keep the ordinances of God. Not because, well, the pastors said, "Well, we're going to have the Lord's table and foot washing." We keep it because we see the unseen. &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, I'm preaching to you now. If we see the unseen, well, our harmony and our relationship in families and husbands and wives, when we see the unseen, it will be as God has ordained it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think I have just about about eight or 10 minutes. I'm going to close. The Bible says that we should take any part out of the word or add add any part. Brother Brennham dwells on that a great deal and he calls it God's allotted and he says this uh give me slide six would you please? God in every age allotted his word from the beginning. And every time and every time in which one of those ages passed by, God sends down an anointed prophet for that age. In the days of Noah, days of all of the rest of them, when he made the promises, I don't care what kind of a condition the church got into, he always does that. He sends a man anointed for the word of the Lord comes to the prophet. And the next one, please. Next. We couldn't have Moses message. Moses couldn't have had Noah's message. We got the message of the hour. We couldn't have had Luther's message. We couldn't have had Wesley's message. This is another time God allotted his word to each age. Can the church agree and say amen? &gt;&gt; And as that age comes along, he sends someone there to vindicate that word to prove that it's true. We'll just hold that on the screen for a moment. This is what we are. This is what we are under. &gt;&gt; This is what has taken place. &gt;&gt; This is another time. And God has allotted his word to each age. And as that age comes along, he sends someone there to vindicate. So he has sent his messenger to vindicate. But now he sends a people. We are sent &gt;&gt; to receive it. &gt;&gt; And by receiving it, the Holy Spirit has fell upon us &gt;&gt; and seized us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To manifest the word that was vindicated. That's what you've been sent for. And I I feel a it's incumbent upon me to re to announce to this congregation, you and I don't care who you are. I don't care how weak you feel. I don't care what's happened to you. If the Holy Spirit has made real this word and has anchored it in your heart, then God has has brought you to this season because he's going to he has released his spirit upon you &gt;&gt; to live out the word. that he has sent to this generation. We cannot apologize for it. It's something that God has done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just surrender to it. Just yield to it and confess it and say, "That's what I'm here for. And I'm looking to the unseen. The God that brought it here. The God who sent the messenger. The God who vindicated it. The God who brought me all down through the centuries. who brought a a seed together and brought parents together, brought man and woman together and brought me on the scene at this time for a specific purpose. I have receive this word and now a power has been released upon me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I haven't got time to read it, but it's in Don't turn to it now. I'll just go over the account. There's a woman. She's the widow of Zerapath. She's a Shunomite. And Brother Brham preaches on her and Elijah and the meal offering. I want you to listen real close as I come to a close. She thinks that she is dying and she has every reason to believe she's dying and her son is dying. And if you listen to that, brother Brandham tells it in a story form. It doesn't sound like a great deep message, but he says he starts out like I can see the sun is. It's just breaking of day. It's going to be another hot day. Sun burning down on that blistering desert. It's been no water or rain for three and a half years. And he says, the boy is crying in the night. Mama, isn't there just a piece of bread? Can you just get me something? His little gaunt frame. He said she's lived an honorable life. She's been an honorable woman. She rises and it's very early and leaves him there. And brother Brandham describes the whole night. Said she didn't get much sleep, maybe just a little bit here and a little bit there because of the child and her own gauntness. And and and she knows that death is upon them. and she goes out and she's going to find just two sticks. Now, while she's doing this, God has already spoken to the servant, &gt;&gt; the man of God, Elijah. God has already spoken to him and told him, "You go, for I have commanded a woman to feed you. I've commanded her." When she was listening to her son, she was listening to those dying whimpers. She was already under a commandment to live. She thought everything &gt;&gt; the world's turned against God's turned against me. &gt;&gt; The weather, we haven't had rain. We're in a famine. People are dying everywhere. Animals dying everywhere. We have nothing. Everything's turned against us. &gt;&gt; We're in the judgment of God. God must be very, very displeased. and I'm caught in it and I must go. And while she's walking out, excuse me for demonstrating it, but she walks out. There's not much wood. She finds two sticks. When she picks them up, she's actually picked up the emblem of the cross. Brother BM said couldn't be three. It had to be two. &gt;&gt; It was two sticks and it pointed to the cross. And she had just a little bit of oil and a little bit of meal and the meal was the word and the oil was the spirit. She had just a little bit left. But she was under a commandment to live and she thought, "I am dying. My son is dying. We're going to expire in just a short time. But she doesn't realize that while she walks and while she's looking and while she's coming back, she's under a commandment. &gt;&gt; Something has been released upon her. &gt;&gt; But she doesn't know it. Right. &gt;&gt; And I felt so urgent to say to this congregation, you're white waiting your way through the darkness of Leodysia, through the deception of this age, through the dreadful time. There's never been an age like this age, and you're trying to make your way through it. It's a it's a treacherous time. But I say to you, in the name of the Lord, you're a power has been released upon you. Hallelujah. And you shall come to a resurrection. You shall come to a rapture. That is thus says the word of God. You've been called to it and God has sent a message to you and God has vindicated the message to you and you can do nothing else but make it. &gt;&gt; That's the word of God. &gt;&gt; And while she went about the things that she could see, she could see her son. She could see the little place she was. She could see the sky. She could see the sun. The things that were seen are temporal. &gt;&gt; She didn't realize that she was under a power. &gt;&gt; Strange power. She hears a voice. Woman. Brother Bren says she turned around saw a man kind of hairs hanging down. Said there was something about him. He was something kind about him. just get me a little water. Asking her for water. Haven't had rain for three and a half years. Water is such a precious commodity. But God was going to test her. &gt;&gt; And there was just something about that voice that God had come to her because she was such a quality within. She starts to go for the water. said, "Just excuse me a moment. Would you mind bringing a little morsel of bread with sir? Only have a little handful of meal. My situation is dust and a little bit of oil to mix with it. And my son is laying in there dying and I'm going to give it to him. We're going to die. Nevertheless, she went. And now while she's going, he says, "I say unto thee." Oh, he said, "It's the words that it's the words that we long to hear. Thus saith the Lord." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not interested. Thus sayith the great man. Thus sayith somebody. Thus saith the Lord. The barrel of meal shall not fail. And the cruise of oil shall not waste away. It shall not fail. It's thus sayeth the Lord. And my brother, my sister, we don't have we're not following enticing things of man's wisdom. We've had thus sayeth the Lord. That's one thing I can say from message to message. It's thus sayith the Lord. And those things that have so gripped my own heart and soul. The greatest of miracles have revealed the secret of the heart. And that great miracle came to you and revealed the secret of your heart. And you you have accepted it and received it. And if you haven't, I urge you to do so today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And follow that impulse. Say, "Oh God, tell me friends, what would you lose? What would a man or woman, what would a young person lose by saying, I'm going to follow that impulse from an unseen realm? It will bring you to life. It will bring you to eternal life. I'm proud. I'm thankful for you that have. Don't ever let Satan tell you a lie. Don't ever believe his his deceit. Don't ever believe it'll take you on a wrong track. Don't look at the things that are around you. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, my friends. What friends? &gt;&gt; Who's going to be here 150 years from now?" &gt;&gt; Then what friends? &gt;&gt; My job. What job? &gt;&gt; What are you going to have when when the strength is gone from your body? And what are you going to have when you get as old as I do? What are you going to have unless we are unless we're connected, hallelujah, by an inside impulse and inspiration to the unseen realm. While we look not at the things that are seen, but the things which are unseen. If God gives you things that are seen, fine. Whatever God chooses to do, may he gives and he takes away. I say blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. May we be our hearts made ready. Dear father, in the somnity of this moment, we hear and we read about both men and women. And I was so particularly moved a widow. How your prophet said she must have been a young woman and she was keeping herself to meet her mate on the other side. Oh God, you came to her and while she was struggling with the visible in the scene, she didn't realize it, but she was already under a commission for life. Life. She was being moved by the power of life. Father God, Father God, my dear father, look upon us here today. Look upon each person that is in their homes, in their rooms, in their gatherings, Lord, that may be streaming at this time. And may they confess openly. May they say it and make a verbal statement. I have been called of God. I have heard his voice. I have responded to it. I have heard the vindicated message of God. I have heard thus sayaeth the Lord. I've heard it not merely in my ears but down. It has resonated in my soul. And now I am here this morning confessing, oh God, that I'm being moved by a strange force called the power of life. Many times I haven't realized it, but I want to recognize it this morning. It is you, oh Lord. It is you that has guided my footsteps. It is you that have brought me to this hour. And I give all that I am or ever can be to you and to your to the blessing of your kingdom and to the furtherance of it. Jesus, I pray that you will just take every person here and seize us. That one that has not been seized, seize them. That one that has not been filled with the Holy Spirit, seize them. Let the Holy Spirit fall upon them. The name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I wonder if there's someone here that is in special spiritual need and you want to just raise your hand. Say, "Remember me." Special spiritual need. All right. Thank you, Father. Father, with these hands raised, may just keep them up before God. Hearts that are honest, hearts that are desperate before you, seeking spiritual guidance, seeking to know what you'd have them to do, seeking, oh God, that you would make yourself known and reveal yourself to them in a much deeper way. Let this morning be a morning, Lord. Let it be a milestone in their lives. Oh almighty God, you've been present with us today. You have a purpose. You have a plan for your people. And I pray that it will be fulfilled. And no obstacle, Lord, will be able to detain your people or hinder them in any way. Move mightily, oh God. Put within the hearts of the people, especially those of the younger of the younger group, oh God. Put a such a zeal within them, such a determination within them. Make them fearless &gt;&gt; for the glory of God. May they be the fearless men and women, young men and young ladies that you've spoken of in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I want to I want to turn and sing. 22:45. in the great triumphant mourning. You can stand if you will please. The reason I chose this song was this is what we've been called for. Is what you've been called for. Can you imagine the multitude that you're going to sh you're going to rub shoulders with this weekend are headed for a great tribulation. &gt;&gt; There's things that move things of foot in the world today and I see those things and I I have no desire to remain here while those things are in effect. Those of you that got young families, you want to thank God the children that you're raising up are raised under under the shadow, under the glory cloud, under the pillar of cloud, under the pillar of fire. You want to thank God for that? Hallelujah. Do you believe what I've said this morning? &gt;&gt; God has allotted a certain portion of this word to you. Listen, the plagues, that was Moses' part. The Exodus, that was Moses' part. No one else could do that. That was his part. &gt;&gt; Mount Carmel, that was Elijah's part. That was his part. Peter in the fishing boat, that was his part. Catching 154 fish or whatever it was, that was his part. I wasn't there. I couldn't do it. You weren't there. [Music] 120. That was their part. &gt;&gt; That was their part and they did it &gt;&gt; and they were ordained to it. &gt;&gt; They did it and then the many others and then from then on how it spread on that was their part. I say to you unequivocally there is a certain allotment and God has sent that allotment down &gt;&gt; and released it. &gt;&gt; There's no doubt here it's been released has it? No doubt here in this congregation has been released and God brought you up out of the earth &gt;&gt; to meet that release of the word and to have received it and he has sent his spirit to make that word alive and quicken it to you. I adjure you in the name of Jesus Christ, do not allow the things that you see in this visible realm to affect that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I feel that, you know, Satan, he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't really like this, but I'm going to really lay it in. He doesn't want it. He's He's all taken up with this visible realm and we're to be we're not to be distracted by it. &gt;&gt; We live in it, but we're not of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Use it up, but we're going to another place. We're going to another world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll be benefited by this service. I know you will. &gt;&gt; And if you need to hear it again, you can stream it again. Amen. Amen. And I've been very moved by this since I was in Africa, even till now. Hallelujah. In the great triumphant morning when we hear the bridegroom cry and the dead in Christ. Now we'll be changing [Applause] [Music] in the sky. We shall rise. We shall all him. The morning and the day Christ shall rise. We shall all rise to meet him. We shall all go to dreaming and we'll have a merry supper in the sky in the great triumph. But more what a happy time will be in Christ arise. [Applause] The Lord descends his glory. Sets him waiting children free. And we meet him in the sky. We shall all rise to meet him. We shall all go to greet him in the morning. When the dead in Christ shall rise, we shall shall greet him and shall have a merry supper in the sun. Now that sec that second verse spoke of him descending. He has descended. We don't question that at all. And if he didn't, he descended with an open book in his hand. So these saints were writing these songs prior to a lot of the things we've already experienced and we're not confused about that. Let's sing the last verse please. The fourth verse. In the great triumphant warning all the kingdoms will possess. Then the dead in Christ shall rise. Reign as kings and priests eternal under Christ forever blessed after me in the sky. We shall all rise to meet him. We shall all go to reach him the morning when the dead in Christ shall rise. We shall all rise to meet him. We shall all the great and shall have a merry supper in disguise. Somebody somebody has been ordained &gt;&gt; to experience the resurrection. &gt;&gt; And what I understand of this message that that had to prelude the actual physical resurrection of the saints. &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to meet him. Are you one of those? &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. Grant it. Oh my. I trust. I keep looking for them. &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't we? &gt;&gt; It's our part. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm just going to dismiss you. We've gone a little longer than we wanted to. Father, I pray that you will throughout this afternoon, I'm asking that there'll be a sweetness of your presence, a sweetness of the spirit of expectation. Expectation, Lord. And I do not know what our brother John Andy's will minister tonight, but I feel and sense, oh God, that you're setting this day aside to do a supernatural work, supernatural things in our lives. Lord, I'm so happy to see all that are here that are present. So thankful, Lord. so thankful. They're here, oh God, as trophies of your grace. They're here, oh God, as evidence of Satan's miserable defeat. &gt;&gt; And we give you praise over that. We thank you for the powerful power of the cross of Christ. Bless these people in the name of Jesus Christ. Dismiss us now. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I'm dismissing you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. But as I look down upon you, I tell you what, my soul, my heart is just throbbing. As I look across this congregation and think how how defeated Satan is. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He delivered us from the power of darkness to the power of his light. &gt;&gt; From the power of death to the power of life. &gt;&gt; You people go. Don't forget these words. You are moving. Moving by the power of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're dismissed in Jesus name. God with you. Amen. God bless you, brother John. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Hello. Good morning. [Music]
