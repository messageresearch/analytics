[17:42] Afghanistan for his sixth tour. Very
[17:45] dangerous assignment. Want to remember
[17:48] brother Ed Dods.
[17:50] [Music]
[17:52] in the nursing home this morning as
[17:54] well.
[17:55] It's now been two and a half years since
[17:58] he has sat had his stroke. I want to
[18:01] remember that on behalf of Sister Sally
[18:04] Dodds this morning. God bless you,
[18:05] Sister Sally. It's good to have you
[18:07] here. We'll have brother John come and
[18:09] lead us in prayer this morning. If you
[18:11] have a special need upon your heart or
[18:13] it's desired that the Lord would speak
[18:14] to you in a special way, let's make it
[18:16] known by the uplifted hand as we go to
[18:18] prayer. Brother John.
[18:24] Heavenly Father, just to be in your
[18:26] house is a privilege, Lord, to be able
[18:28] to lift up our hearts and our hands and
[18:31] sing praises to your holy name. Lord, we
[18:34] just want to open up our mouths right
[18:36] now and say, "Thank you, Jesus. Glorify
[18:39] your name, God. For without you, where
[18:41] would we be this morning? out in the
[18:43] world somewhere, some pig pin, some slop
[18:47] of this world that is swiftly fading and
[18:50] degenerating into a horrible hell. But
[18:54] Lord, you've spoken a word and a message
[18:56] to us, saying, "Come a little higher,
[18:58] little bride. Come a little higher.
[19:01] Spread your wings, eagles, and fly up
[19:03] into the heavenlies where all things are
[19:05] possible." Lord, to be able to sing the
[19:08] songs of victory and of faith gives us
[19:11] encouragement, Lord, that we are not
[19:13] alone in this battle, but you are with
[19:16] us, even in us all the way to the end.
[19:19] And Lord, we just want to come into your
[19:21] presence, God, humbly, Lord, realizing
[19:24] it's all amazing grace and mercy. It's
[19:27] all because of your choosing and your
[19:29] election that we even have a desire for
[19:32] you. So we just pray that you would open
[19:34] the floodgates of your heart today, God.
[19:37] And may there be a mutual response from
[19:40] us, Lord. That there would be a
[19:42] communication, God, and a reaching out
[19:44] in praises and waving of our hands and
[19:48] shouting hallelujah. And Lord, let us
[19:51] all be worshippers today, God. We're not
[19:53] here to spectate, God. We're here to
[19:56] participate, God, and get into
[19:58] salvation. get into our healing, God, as
[20:02] hands are lifted up all over the
[20:04] service, Lord, showing that we have
[20:06] needs, God, and but we serve a great
[20:09] God. And we pray that you'd release the
[20:12] power, God, and every heart to believe
[20:14] that all things are possible for them,
[20:17] Lord. And as sheep, Lord, we come to eat
[20:20] on sheep food today. And as eagles, God,
[20:24] we're gathered around the carcass. We
[20:26] believe we're hearing a word that's
[20:28] going to take us in a rapture. It's
[20:30] getting us ready for a body change, God.
[20:32] And I pray that you would lift up our
[20:34] eyes and lift up our affection from our
[20:37] own uh situations or our own little
[20:40] petty things that's in our lives and get
[20:42] a vision of the bride, God. And what
[20:45] you're doing in the word, Father, as
[20:47] vision, God, is so quicker than our
[20:50] natural sight, Lord. Take us up into
[20:52] that six sense today, God. God, and pour
[20:55] out revelation through our pastor, God,
[20:58] that we as your people, God, could come
[21:00] up into heavenly places, God. We long
[21:04] for the supernatural, as David said, to
[21:07] see the glory. And we hunger and thirst,
[21:09] Lord, to see you, God, high and lifted
[21:12] up in all your beauty. Lord, would you
[21:15] forgive us all of our sins, of our
[21:18] iniquities, God? We don't want there to
[21:20] be any blockages today, God. Keep the
[21:24] way clear. Let nothing be between us,
[21:27] Lord.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're not here to hide behind
[21:30] anything or anyone else. We need Jesus.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; We need the Lord today, God. And we're
[21:36] in your house, God. Just may you meet
[21:39] every need as our brother Edwin Dods.
[21:41] Lord, be with him and his family on this
[21:44] Father's Day, God. And this other
[21:46] gentleman going into service for his
[21:49] country. I just pray for him and his
[21:51] family. be with all of us today, God.
[21:54] This special day, God, this day of your
[21:56] appearing. I pray that your word would
[21:59] be precious. May you meet every need
[22:01] divinely beyond what we could ever ask
[22:04] or think, God. And may there be waves
[22:07] upon waves of your glory in the services
[22:09] today, Lord. We love you. We love you,
[22:13] Jesus. And we thank you for answering
[22:15] every prayer for your glory and your
[22:17] honor in Jesus name. Amen.
[22:26] [Music]
[22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats this
[22:32] morning. I think they got those slides
[22:35] for us on the sanctuary,
[22:37] the new facility in Tuck Willis. So,
[22:39] this is a quick look at the sanctuary
[22:42] from back at the sound booth. So, I
[22:44] don't know how many know in the past
[22:46] they've had to carry in the soundboard.
[22:48] they've had to carry each Friday night
[22:49] and each Sunday. So, they basically set
[22:51] up church down there from scratch. You
[22:54] set up all the chairs. Well, now they
[22:56] don't have to do that. So, you can see
[22:57] they've got a very nice uh seating
[22:59] facility there. And uh go to the fourth
[23:03] slide if you could. They have a
[23:05] baptismal tank right in the church. So,
[23:08] they don't have to go down and try and
[23:10] uh get a hotel that has a little
[23:12] swimming pool where we've done the
[23:14] baptisms in the past. They have a nice
[23:16] little um the next slide over number
[23:19] five that's connected to the sanctuary.
[23:21] So the sanctuary actually seats about
[23:23] 130 150 people and then they have a wall
[23:26] that's removable and uh this is on the
[23:28] other side of the wall so you can have
[23:30] uh little meetings over there in outside
[23:33] of the regular services. This is a
[23:35] hallway showing down into the uh
[23:37] sanctuaries there on the left.
[23:41] This is the kind of the foyer sitting
[23:43] area. just as you come in. They have a
[23:45] very nice nursery. So, just show the
[23:47] nursery real quick to the moms. That's a
[23:50] very important aspect. So, that'll be
[23:52] fine. Aren't we happy for them?
[23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord a a hand. We
[23:57] appreciate his provision. Amen. I know
[24:01] they've been praying and desiring a
[24:02] place for quite some time. As the Sunday
[24:05] school children come in, Brother Ellie's
[24:07] going to come and bless us with a
[24:08] special this morning. So, if Brother
[24:10] Ellie could come in, and I think the
[24:12] Sunday school children are ready to come
[24:13] in this morning.
[24:17] Why don't we just sing uh
[24:20] Lord, I lift your name, your holy name.
[24:26] Lord, I lift
[24:30] your
[24:32] name.
[24:35] your holy
[24:39] name.
[24:42] your home
[24:45] God,
[24:53] the
[24:55] great
[24:57] I am,
[25:01] the
[25:04] lamb,
[25:07] my comfort.
[25:11] earth
[25:13] and
[25:14] he
[25:19] Lord I live
[25:23] your name
[25:26] your holy
[25:30] name Jehovah God
[25:38] &gt;&gt; is Oh,
[25:44] the
[25:46] great
[25:48] I am
[25:51] the
[25:55] lamb.
[25:58] I come.
[26:00] [Music]
[26:16] In this tri
[26:23] when Christ from glory
[26:26] has already descended,
[26:29] many hearts are failing
[26:32] and filled with fear.
[26:34] We know the end time is already here.
[26:39] So just be faithful,

[26:46] that you have heard, listen to his
[26:50] prophet, his message he walk in the

[28:12] promise he gave the bride from the white

[30:00] failing. Is awakening.
[30:03] Nations are breaking our brand and to we
[30:08] believe the end.
[30:10] Have you considered
[30:12] the end message? Have you considered
[30:17] Malachi 4, Revelation 10:7 and say Luke
[30:23] 17 proclaim this message now and they
[30:26] are forever more. The end is here. It
[30:31] now
[30:33] the bride is gathering. The world is
[30:36] failing. Is awakening.
[30:40] Nations are breaking our brand and to as
[30:44] we believe the end is here.
[30:47] Sir is the time
[30:49] Brana spoke of the angel came
[30:54] with a shout. The mountain sure as the
[30:59] voice cried out time is no more loud and
[31:03] the shadow went for the end is here.
[31:08] It's now our turn. The bride is
[31:11] gathering. The world is failing. Isire
[31:16] awakening.
[31:17] Nations are breaking.
[31:20] Abraham to as we believe at the end is
[31:24] God bless.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can't you see why I'm happy?
[31:38] Oh, can't you see
[31:40] [Applause]
[31:42] why
[31:43] I'm so happy?
[31:48] For I've accepted
[31:50] the word
[31:52] of the Lord,
[31:57] the revealed
[32:00] word that was spoken
[32:06] by the prophet
[32:09] of Malachi.
[32:14] Oh, can't you see
[32:18] why
[32:20] I'm so happy
[32:23] [Applause]
[32:24] I've accepted
[32:27] the word
[32:29] of the Lord.
[32:33] A revealed
[32:36] word
[32:37] that was spoken
[32:42] by the prophet
[32:45] of Malachi.
[32:47] [Music]
[32:50] I'm amazed. So we invite our pastor to
[32:53] come this morning. It's good to have our
[32:55] brother Tom back.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:00] Praise the Lord.
[33:02] Sister, God bless you. Good to have you
[33:04] back this morning. So, brother Aaron and
[33:08] heard brother Phillip on the phone.
[33:10] Different ones. Spiritual Israel visited
[33:13] natural Israel. Now, they've come back
[33:16] and they've brought some fruit, I'm
[33:17] sure, here this evening. Praise the
[33:20] Lord. So happy to be in the house of the
[33:22] Lord. It's good to have our pastor come
[33:24] and minister. The Lord has laid on his
[33:26] heart. Did it plant some expectation in
[33:29] your hearts when he came Wednesday
[33:30] evening after brother Murphy spoke and
[33:33] the Lord's already changing the
[33:35] direction?
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. We appreciate the yielding to the
[33:39] Holy Spirit. We invite brother Biscoll
[33:42] to come this morning. Why don't we stand
[33:43] and sing this together?
[33:47] I'm amazed
[33:52] that you love me.
[33:56] I
[33:58] [Music]
[34:05] through your preious
[34:08] love I found for you.
[34:12] [Applause]
[34:14] And I saw
[34:18] [Music]
[34:20] wash away. All my sins
[34:25] are wash
[34:28] away.
[34:31] I'm
[34:35] that love me.
[34:40] How
[34:44] you
[34:46] [Applause]
[34:48] through your preious
[34:51] blood I found for you and my sins
[34:57] my
[34:58] [Applause]
[35:03] wash away all my
[35:08] Oh,
[35:12] I believe
[35:14] I believe
[35:18] that you love me.
[35:22] I believe
[35:26] that you
[35:31] through your preious
[35:34] love. I found part
[35:39] and my s
[35:42] are
[35:44] there. All washed away. All I see
[35:50] are
[35:52] [Music]
[35:56] &gt;&gt; what a glorious
[35:59] realization.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:04] I'm going to just sing that once again
[36:06] in a moment, but I had a a email first
[36:09] thing this morning and uh brother Milo
[36:12] was with brother uh Jonathan Larga and
[36:17] it said here we are in Croatia
[36:20] and brother Milco is with us and they're
[36:23] watching the service right now. So it's
[36:26] live streaming and he is interpreting
[36:29] for others I would imagine that are of
[36:32] the Croatian language and then on
[36:36] Thursday they will fly to Macedonia
[36:41] and you've read in the Bible about
[36:42] Macedonia. That's where Paul went.
[36:46] So they're going to be having services
[36:48] there.
[36:50] uh they don't know of any believers
[36:51] there as yet, but I told you I think
[36:54] last week of the of brother Jonathan
[36:58] putting profile of brother Bam's message
[37:01] on the Facebook and they had a number of
[37:04] inquiries
[37:05] of people from Macedonia and so they're
[37:09] going to be with them I believe and take
[37:11] the message down there. Isn't it
[37:13] wonderful? Wonderful to have a part of
[37:16] it, isn't it?
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And tonight we're going
[37:18] to hear about the believers that are in
[37:21] Israel and the meetings that brother
[37:23] Tom, Sister Joanne had there, brother
[37:25] Milo, Brother Phillip, Brother Aaron
[37:27] were also there. And so we're happy to
[37:32] do whatever we can to strengthen and
[37:34] edify and build up the body of Jesus
[37:36] Christ. That's what we're here for and
[37:38] we're all part of it. We build up one
[37:41] another, we strengthen one another. And
[37:43] we're just so thankful for that. Amen.
[37:47] Let's just sing that chorus once again.
[37:49] I'm amazed.
[37:54] [Music]
[37:56] [Applause]
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Let's give him praise now.
[38:02] [Applause]
[38:05] How you
[38:09] through your preious
[38:12] love I found in you
[38:18] and my
[38:23] all
[38:27] my sins
[38:29] are
[38:32] give him praise once
[38:35] I'm amazed
[38:39] that you love me.
[38:43] I'm
[38:49] [Applause]
[38:50] [Music]
[38:51] through your preious
[38:54] blood.
[38:57] party
[39:00] and my sins. Oh, they're all
[39:05] they're all washed away. All my sins
[39:11] are
[39:15] [Music]
[39:17] &gt;&gt; just before we turn to the word, let's
[39:19] just bow our heads in prayer. Prayer is
[39:22] always in season. Father, I'm
[39:26] approaching you now through the name of
[39:28] Jesus Christ, the beloved son of God,
[39:33] our redeemer, our savior, our healer,
[39:36] and whatever needs may exist here in
[39:38] this sanctuary today or whatever needs
[39:42] may exist in all of the places where
[39:45] this uh service is being streamed right
[39:48] now. I pray, oh God, that hearts of men
[39:51] and women everywhere, young people and
[39:54] even children everywhere will realize
[39:56] that God is nigh to them. And as we
[39:59] speak, Lord, the things you've placed
[40:02] upon my own heart today, I pray that it
[40:04] will be quickened by the same Holy
[40:06] Ghost, the author of this word. In the
[40:09] name of Jesus Christ, bless speaker and
[40:12] hearers, we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless
[40:17] you. Thank you for standing. I'll have
[40:19] you open your Bibles please to Matthew
[40:24] 24th chapter.
[40:30] And we know that Matthew 24 have special
[40:35] place in the seals
[40:38] spoke of the spoke of the seals
[40:42] in the first part of it. But we're going
[40:44] to go to verse 31.
[40:50] And he shall send his angels and a great
[40:53] sound of a trumpet and they shall gather
[40:57] together his elect from the four winds
[41:00] and from one end of heaven to the other.
[41:03] I was listening to brother Ellie
[41:06] singing and he kept singing about
[41:09] repeating the gathering of the bride. I
[41:13] thought that was quite a confirmation.
[41:16] Now learn a parable of the fig tree when
[41:18] his branch is yet tender and putteth
[41:21] forth leaves. Know that the summer is
[41:25] nigh. So likewise ye when you shall see
[41:29] all these things, know that it is near,
[41:31] even at the doors.
[41:34] Verily I say unto you, this generation
[41:36] shall not pass till all these things be
[41:39] fulfilled.
[41:41] Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my
[41:45] words shall not pass away.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; If you'll turn then please to Genesis
[41:50] the 49th chapter. Going to just read one
[41:54] verse there.
[42:11] Jacob speaking
[42:14] of his uh sons
[42:17] and he asked them to gather themselves
[42:19] together in verse one that I may tell
[42:22] you that which shall befall you in the
[42:25] last days.
[42:27] And then in verse 49,
[42:32] he says, "The scepter shall not depart
[42:35] from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between
[42:39] his feet until Shiloh come, and unto him
[42:44] shall the gathering of the people be.
[42:48] The scepter shall not depart from Judah,
[42:52] nor a lawgiver from between his feet
[42:55] until Shiloh come. And unto him shall
[42:59] the gathering of the people be. And I
[43:04] want to take those that last phrase as a
[43:06] text for the morning service.
[43:10] And unto him shall the gathering of the
[43:13] people be. May God bless his word as you
[43:16] have your seats.
[43:25] In questions and answers,
[43:27] brother Brandham said, "Now the
[43:30] gathering will be unto the Lord."
[43:34] Shiloh was a place, but Shiloh was also
[43:37] a person. It must be because it said
[43:40] unto him. But Shiloh was a place in the
[43:43] Bible. was one of the uh notable cities
[43:46] when brother Brandham preached uh why
[43:48] little Bethlehem he said yes why little
[43:51] Bethlehem
[43:53] because it could have been at Gilead or
[43:56] it could have been at uh Shiloh or one
[43:59] of the other notable cities, notable
[44:01] places of worship and they did go up to
[44:04] Shiloh to worship. But he went on to
[44:07] say, "When Shiloh comes, and the
[44:10] gathering will be unto him, there will
[44:13] not be a lawgiver uh from between the
[44:16] feet until Shiloh come," speaking of
[44:19] Judah, "and to him shall the gathering
[44:23] be."
[44:26] There's uh untold numbers of of
[44:28] gatherings
[44:30] in the world.
[44:32] Uh
[44:34] there's gatherings both large and small
[44:38] and I am wanting to just begin the
[44:42] service this morning
[44:45] uh but by asking why are we gathered
[44:48] here and what has gathered you here?
[44:53] Uh what is it? Is it uh you know is it a
[44:56] friend? Is it family? Is it what is the
[44:59] gathering? And I want you to just keep
[45:02] that in mind.
[45:04] There's uh
[45:06] large and small gatherings. There's
[45:08] political gatherings, religious
[45:11] gatherings,
[45:13] sports gatherings, entertainment
[45:15] gatherings.
[45:18] And then when these great, you know,
[45:20] mobs of people or crowds of people
[45:23] gather, I think it's a I think it's a a
[45:26] a worthy question. You know, what has
[45:29] gathered these people here?
[45:33] Um,
[45:35] I have a few slides and I want to just
[45:47] sports event.
[45:50] So, something's gathered them. Brother
[45:52] Beam talks about people getting into the
[45:54] spirit of something. So, they're in the
[45:56] spirit of something. I don't even know
[45:57] what event it is and I'm not concerned
[46:00] about it. This is the freedom march in
[46:02] Washington
[46:04] and a lot of people gathered there. They
[46:06] probably traveled uh on trains and flew
[46:09] on planes and spent a lot of money and
[46:12] staying in motel. So they feel that
[46:14] there's some worthy uh objective
[46:18] for them to be there. And then uh
[46:24] we have also spiritual gatherings. This
[46:27] is a Billy Graham meeting. And we could
[46:29] have gone on and on and on with this,
[46:30] but we're I just want to make a point.
[46:34] All these people have gathered.
[46:38] The Bible says, "I'll send my me I'll
[46:40] send my angels and they will gather."
[46:43] Brother Brandham said, "Brother Billy
[46:46] Graeme is a messenger."
[46:48] And he gathered uh tens of thousands and
[46:51] into the millions of people when it when
[46:54] it becomes a total. Now, here's a
[46:57] gathering. And these are prisoners of
[46:59] war in a war camp. This is in 1945.
[47:04] Uh I want to make a distinction between
[47:07] these other gatherings which I just
[47:09] showed and they are people went there of
[47:12] their own valition.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; They went there of their own accord.
[47:17] And there there is uh to be understood
[47:20] there's a certain degree of oneness.
[47:24] We are all here to see this sports
[47:26] event.
[47:28] We are all here to hear this musical
[47:31] group. And so people gather and they
[47:35] have a oneness and a unity of of intent
[47:39] and objective.
[47:41] Now these men that are here
[47:44] are all prisoners of war and none of
[47:46] them wanted to go there.
[47:49] They are in one place.
[47:51] They are unified in in I would imagine
[47:55] unified in one thought and that is we
[47:58] want to get out of here.
[48:00] I think that we are unified in that
[48:03] thought.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; We want to get out of here.
[48:09] Amen.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; This place here probably was a bit of a
[48:13] pest house with rodents and fleas and
[48:18] bed bugs and whatever more and they want
[48:20] to get out of there. So, they didn't go
[48:22] there uh of their own valition.
[48:27] This is a group of people. These are
[48:29] Jewish women that have been gathered up.
[48:34] They didn't want to go to the ghettos.
[48:37] They didn't want to be torn from their
[48:40] children and families.
[48:42] They have arrived at a death camp. They
[48:46] don't know perhaps it's a death camp.
[48:49] They have been reduced from
[48:52] uh almost dehumanized
[48:56] but this was a long process and I won't
[48:59] want to get into that but this is
[49:01] another group which they have gone a wee
[49:04] bit further into the process. They have
[49:07] had all of their hair removed. I had
[49:10] pictures of huge bales
[49:12] of hair and I have been in Awitz more
[49:16] than once and have seen uh what was
[49:20] which they had not bailed up yet and
[49:23] piles of toothbrushes and combs because
[49:26] they dehumanized them and took away
[49:27] combs, took away toothbrushes and it was
[49:30] all a process to make them feel
[49:35] almost uh unhuman. And I have been with
[49:38] people. I've met quite a few of the
[49:40] survivors and one became a very very
[49:43] good friend of mine in Toronto and his
[49:46] mark was branded in his hand, his number
[49:49] which he could not possibly get out. And
[49:52] uh he didn't really want to speak of
[49:54] those things because it was such a
[49:58] process. And here's a group of men. Now
[50:02] these men, none of these people wanted
[50:04] to be there. They're not unified in
[50:07] desire of wanting to be there. I would
[50:10] say they're unified in the desire to get
[50:13] free from there. And this is them as s
[50:17] not the same men, but these are some by
[50:20] by uh survivors.
[50:24] One is holding his metal tag on this
[50:28] side.
[50:30] And of course it becomes much more
[50:33] gruesome than that, but I'm not going to
[50:35] go into that.
[50:37] Uh these were some of the uh young
[50:40] people.
[50:43] And uh these were children. They're all
[50:46] behind the barbed wire and they don't
[50:49] know what their future.
[50:54] And this is another group.
[51:00] I told you this would be a little
[51:02] different service.
[51:05] Satan
[51:06] put them behind that barb wire,
[51:09] but God allowed him to do it. Satan
[51:13] inspired dictators
[51:16] &gt;&gt; and violent men
[51:18] filled with hatred,
[51:21] filled with vengeance and filled with
[51:23] death, the spirit of death and slew
[51:27] untold millions of these people,
[51:31] &gt;&gt; none of them wanting to go. It was a
[51:34] mark on a whole face, a wound on the
[51:36] whole face of the entire earth and one
[51:39] that everyone vows we never want to see
[51:42] again. But I can tell you those same
[51:44] spirits are alive and well yet today.
[51:48] And they've got more ways to take people
[51:51] down into but these people that you see
[51:55] behind these walls or behind this bar of
[51:59] wire and see them. God has white robes
[52:04] for them.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; And you would never have a preacher be
[52:08] able to tell you that unless you got a
[52:10] prophet that could see into the word of
[52:13] God.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; And here's what we read. I think that's
[52:16] just one of the things that's holding
[52:18] this nation, speaking of America,
[52:20] together because they've always
[52:24] respected the Jew. Give him a place. You
[52:27] honor a Jew and God will honor you. Now,
[52:30] there's a bunch of Jews that's renegade
[52:33] just like there's Gentiles the same way.
[52:36] But the real Jew, God's put his name on
[52:39] the book before the foundation of the
[52:41] world. And here he was murdered down in
[52:45] this time. And remember,
[52:48] think of it now how perfect this is.
[52:51] Right after them millions of slaughtered
[52:53] Jews, innocent people by the nations of
[52:56] the world. Here the scripture says right
[52:59] in this time that there each one under
[53:02] the altar realized uh what has happened
[53:06] and they are given white robes.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says
[53:15] the scripture says and when he had
[53:18] opened the fifth seal I saw under the
[53:22] altar the souls of them that were slain
[53:26] for the word of God. Now please notice
[53:28] the scripture is is different in the
[53:31] book in revelation. It speaks about
[53:34] those who held the testimony of Jesus
[53:36] Christ.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; These are not holding the testimony of
[53:40] Jesus Christ.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; The scripture says that they were slain
[53:44] for the word of God.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; They are those uh that that the apostle
[53:51] Paul says they the covenants have come
[53:54] by them. The law has come by them. The
[53:57] patriarchs came by them. And and all of
[54:00] the Old Testament came by them. So
[54:04] whatever spirit put these behind uh
[54:07] these kind of uh death camps. And listen
[54:10] friends in Europe there was I have
[54:13] volumes I have volumes entire volumes. I
[54:17] have construction plans and the volumes
[54:19] of how some of these places were built
[54:22] and then expanded and the and the
[54:24] movement of the people and the exact
[54:26] count of those that were killed in
[54:28] certain locations before they even got
[54:31] to death camps. There was a thousand at
[54:34] least a thousand 1,000
[54:38] killing places in Europe in the Ukraine
[54:42] and in Poland and all of those
[54:44] countries. God had something else in his
[54:47] mind. He did not sovereignly. When I say
[54:51] he did not sovereignly, it was not as
[54:54] though he sent his spirit and moved on
[54:56] them to gather into death camps.
[55:00] They were gathered there the same as
[55:03] Pharaoh had had the people and brought
[55:06] them into slavery in in in in uh in
[55:10] Egypt.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; And they were not there willingly. He
[55:14] gathered them there. But God said to
[55:17] Pharaoh, "I raised you up
[55:20] &gt;&gt; and I gave you the power and hardened
[55:23] his heart so that he would hold those
[55:26] people so that God would manifest his
[55:29] strength and deliver them out."
[55:33] &gt;&gt; God has permitted Satan to come to this
[55:36] era in this day that you're living in.
[55:39] This is Satan's Eden
[55:42] &gt;&gt; and it is filled with darkness.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; It is Le Oysia and there isn't a power,
[55:48] there isn't a hope of you ever getting
[55:50] out of here outside of God's program.
[55:54] And I find it this very very significant
[55:58] and unique that while these people are
[56:01] being uh gathered while they're being
[56:04] gathered into into these places right at
[56:08] the same time while they're being
[56:11] gathered here and then something comes
[56:14] over them that we must have a homeland.
[56:16] We must go home. We must go home. At the
[56:19] same time, there's a people that are
[56:22] crying out to God that have they've seen
[56:25] all the churchity and all the religious
[56:28] and there starts to be movement. Uh
[56:30] there in the nations there can be league
[56:33] of nations and then a united nations and
[56:35] in the church world starts to be an
[56:37] ecumenical movement and then a world
[56:40] council of churches and there and a and
[56:42] a spirit of just kind of gathering
[56:44] gathering together because we uh there's
[56:47] some strength in in in some kind of
[56:49] union. So there's this union and the
[56:52] European Union and some other union and
[56:55] whatever more but it's not the answer.
[56:58] And then the religious one are gather
[57:00] were going to gather in a great big uh
[57:02] order of an ecumenical council. At that
[57:04] same time, God sends a voice.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; One single voice.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; And God, the spirit of God, like he
[57:14] moved over the whole face of the earth,
[57:16] moves over the whole face of the earth.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; He literally moves over the face of the
[57:21] earth. It doesn't happen in a corner.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Friends, I want you to get my thought.
[57:25] When God said, "Let there be light."
[57:29] It wasn't light in just one zone or one
[57:32] time zone. It was light. And the earth
[57:36] turned. On one side, it was darkness. On
[57:38] the other side, it was light. Then God
[57:40] said, "Let the earth bring forth." And
[57:42] the earth brought forth all around the
[57:44] globe. All over the earth. And when the
[57:47] when the resurrection takes place, it's
[57:49] not going to be in one location. It's
[57:51] going to take place everywhere because
[57:53] the word of God already is in place to
[57:56] cause that to happen.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; And so God sends one single voice. It it
[58:04] it it it's irrelevant that the voice
[58:07] whether the voice was Isaiah and Israel
[58:10] or Elijah over there or Moses over
[58:12] there. We we've come under the effect of
[58:14] it in our time at the right time. We've
[58:17] come under the effect of those voices.
[58:20] God raised up a voice in this time. He
[58:22] raised up, Brother Brandham, in this
[58:24] time. Malachi 4, he raised up the voice.
[58:27] He raised up the voice of Revelation
[58:29] 10:7. It was one voice. But there was a
[58:32] strange thing happening. There was
[58:34] something that moved over over the
[58:37] people. Uh, and and people weren't even
[58:40] born yet. Something that moved over them
[58:43] that hungered for something. And and it
[58:46] was what came from this voice was the
[58:48] only thing that could satisfy that
[58:49] hunger.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; And so I want to say to you, that's why
[58:52] you're here today.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; That's why you've you've been gathered
[58:56] to that voice.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; And what's really remarkable, friends, I
[58:59] want you to really catch this is that
[59:02] these people here that are being uh
[59:06] driven to these death camps, it was you
[59:09] can never find such a strange and
[59:12] profound statement. and almost a
[59:15] paradoxical statement.
[59:18] It was the tender hand of Jehovah.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; How you how you going to say it's a
[59:23] tender hand of Jehovah?
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Tender hand of Jehovah. I said that to
[59:31] Gerson Solomon. I said it to Rabbi
[59:34] Richmond. This a this is the tender hand
[59:37] of Jehovah. Why? Driving them back to
[59:41] their homeland.
[59:44] You didn't catch that
[59:45] &gt;&gt; tender hand of Jehovah.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; You ought to see the stacks of corpses,
[59:50] the tender hand of Jehovah. And I said
[59:52] to Gerson Solomon, "Anything less than
[59:54] that would not have driven you people
[59:57] back." He said, "That's exactly the
[59:59] truth."
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; I said, "God can only bless the Jew in
[1:00:02] their promised land, and God can only
[1:00:05] bless you in your promised land. You
[1:00:08] can't be someone just coasting along.
[1:00:11] God can only bless you in the promised
[1:00:13] land. I'm talking about now here comes a
[1:00:16] here comes a prophet messenger and
[1:00:19] begins to take the word of God begins to
[1:00:21] lay the word of God out. But in behind
[1:00:24] that comes the Holy Spirit quickening
[1:00:26] that word and making it alive.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; This is Mexico City.
[1:00:40] 1956.
[1:00:43] This is Durban, South Africa. And that's
[1:00:47] only a fraction. This whole section down
[1:00:50] here on the bottom where the where the
[1:00:53] horses raced is filled just like that.
[1:00:56] Choked the city. They were going to have
[1:00:58] a 10-day meeting and it ended up being a
[1:01:01] three-day meeting because it completely
[1:01:03] choked the city. We were lined up down
[1:01:05] the streets and the city couldn't hardly
[1:01:07] move. And this was one of the uh I say
[1:01:11] now all these people had gathered
[1:01:15] uh
[1:01:17] whatever gathered them but they many of
[1:01:20] them most of them did not hear the voice
[1:01:24] that you heard
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; they went there they got healed they saw
[1:01:28] miracles I believe it was either it was
[1:01:31] in Durban brother Brennham told me that
[1:01:33] seven truck loads big steak truck loads
[1:01:36] farm trucks loaded with crutches and
[1:01:39] wheelchairs and and all manner of
[1:01:43] implements of the w of the injured and
[1:01:45] the infirmed and driving down the street
[1:01:48] and people coming in behind singing uh I
[1:01:52] singing only believe only believe
[1:01:56] now that was their their gathering.
[1:02:00] Okay, now we can end that off please.
[1:02:06] And when he had opened the fifth seal,
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; he saw under the altar. So under the
[1:02:12] altar souls of them that were slain for
[1:02:14] the word of God and for the testimony
[1:02:17] which they held. And they cried with a
[1:02:20] loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord,
[1:02:24] holy and true, dust thou not judge and
[1:02:27] avenge our blood on them that dwell on
[1:02:31] the earth? and white robes were given
[1:02:34] unto every one of them. And brother
[1:02:36] Brandham brings out very clearly, if
[1:02:38] they were righteous and had been
[1:02:40] believing on Jesus Christ, they would
[1:02:43] have already had white robes, but white
[1:02:45] robes were given unto them.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; We haven't got time to go into all the
[1:02:51] the questions that there could be. And
[1:02:53] it was said unto them that they should
[1:02:55] rest for a little season until their
[1:02:58] fellow servants also and their brethren
[1:03:01] that should be killed as they were
[1:03:04] should be fulfilled. In the sixth seal,
[1:03:08] he said, "And and those Jews coming in
[1:03:12] from all over the world, everywhere
[1:03:15] being gathered over there," because now
[1:03:17] in the sixth seal, he's referring to
[1:03:19] those that have gathered as a result of
[1:03:21] this. they gathered what drew them there
[1:03:25] was there was no great uh program to
[1:03:29] attract them to Israel or to Palestine.
[1:03:33] In fact is Britain and the uh I don't
[1:03:36] know whether the League of Nations or
[1:03:38] whoever more were there and blockaded
[1:03:41] them and they arrived with chips and
[1:03:43] they wouldn't allow them to even unload
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; but they were driven
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; with the same Holy Spirit that you're
[1:03:52] being driven
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; because they had to fulfill a certain
[1:03:55] part of the scripture. They had to
[1:03:58] return back and at the same time that
[1:04:02] Israel is being made a nation. Here the
[1:04:05] world is receiving another voice.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Why? Because once again the even the
[1:04:11] type of the scripture has to be
[1:04:13] perfectly and this may not be just
[1:04:16] elementary ABCs but I hope that you'll
[1:04:18] get it. And if you don't write a note
[1:04:20] down I'll be happy to try and answer it.
[1:04:22] But it had to happen at that same time
[1:04:26] in in or orchestrated the Holy Spirit
[1:04:29] only he could orchestrate it so that
[1:04:32] Naomi who's the Orthodox church is going
[1:04:35] back home while a voice has come out to
[1:04:39] get the gentile bride Ruth to get her
[1:04:42] gathering because she has to be moving
[1:04:44] towards her home at the same time.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; It has to be in unison. Naomi and Ruth
[1:04:51] go back together.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; It had to be a a prophet coming to the
[1:04:56] Gentiles to gather the bride
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; while Naomi is going back home
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; at the same time.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:06] [Music]
[1:05:10] It
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; says after England and had went in there
[1:05:13] during the time of General Allenbe
[1:05:16] in the in the decline of the world's
[1:05:19] war, then they give it back to Israel
[1:05:23] and she's been growing as a nation. And
[1:05:26] now notice now remember I just said
[1:05:29] Naomi and Ruth have to go back to
[1:05:32] redemption together.
[1:05:34] And here's a prophet saying, "And now
[1:05:37] she is a perfect nation."
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; You may not have even been called when
[1:05:43] this was spoken in 63 in the opening of
[1:05:46] the seals. You may not have even been
[1:05:48] called. You may not have even been born
[1:05:50] yet. But God is an eternal being.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; His word is absolutely eternal. It is
[1:05:56] time locked. And what he speaks of a
[1:05:59] certain age or a certain time or certain
[1:06:01] generation or certain people, that word
[1:06:05] remains effective till the last one of
[1:06:08] those people are in and believe it.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And now she's a perfect
[1:06:14] nation." I will say the holy nation is a
[1:06:17] perfect nation. It's a perfect nation.
[1:06:20] The bride of Jesus Christ is a perfect
[1:06:23] nation. He said she's a perfect nation.
[1:06:26] her own money, her own currency, her own
[1:06:29] flag, her own army, and everything else.
[1:06:32] She has everything that she has need of.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; When the message was finished, the bride
[1:06:36] of Jesus Christ had everything she has
[1:06:38] need of.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; You are absolutely equipped, fully
[1:06:42] equipped. You have everything you have
[1:06:44] need of to take you from here to there.
[1:06:48] in whatever part of the journey you're
[1:06:50] in. Some may still been back in Europe,
[1:06:52] but they had everything they needed
[1:06:54] because because God had moved upon the
[1:06:57] the nation of Israel, upon Naomi's part,
[1:07:01] and a nation was created, and they could
[1:07:03] go back home. And the nation opened
[1:07:05] their arms, said, "Come back home. As
[1:07:08] soon as you land at the airport, you've
[1:07:10] got a place to go. You've got clothes to
[1:07:13] wear. You might come here almost ragged
[1:07:15] and naked, but you've got a home. You
[1:07:18] may have come where you had no food. You
[1:07:19] may have gone back as many of them did
[1:07:22] back to their homes in Europe, wherever
[1:07:24] it was in Europe. And many of them were
[1:07:26] in the Poland, Ukraine, and Germany and
[1:07:28] Austria and so on. They were all over.
[1:07:31] They were scattered. But the word says,
[1:07:33] "I'll scatter you."
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; And the word says, "And I'll gather
[1:07:36] you."
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; God just spoke that. He could have spoke
[1:07:40] it centuries ago, thousands of years
[1:07:43] ago. It was still effective in 1947. in
[1:07:47] 1948 1945
[1:07:50] and I met uh I met an old Jewish man
[1:07:54] Kaman his his name was and he never got
[1:07:56] caught in this because in 1939
[1:07:59] when they were just devising this plan
[1:08:02] he said I was of four sons and my father
[1:08:07] had a successful tailoring business but
[1:08:09] something came over me that I must
[1:08:11] return here to Palestine and he came
[1:08:15] there and and became the uh uh the
[1:08:18] initiator or or or the originator of one
[1:08:22] of the kabutzas where we where we happen
[1:08:25] to stay. I and my family stayed there.
[1:08:28] And what is remarkable friends is that I
[1:08:31] stood there looking at him realizing
[1:08:34] that there was a a divine
[1:08:37] movement
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; to gather him
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; to gather him to where he had to go.
[1:08:44] according to the scripture, he had to go
[1:08:46] there. And the 144,000 will be there.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; They are the ones that God has uh
[1:08:53] selected.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; And so you remember that they go
[1:08:56] together. He said in the 10 virgins, the
[1:08:59] real Jews are gathering into Palestine
[1:09:02] again. And just exactly what the prophet
[1:09:05] said,
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; as Ishmael and Isaac were at one
[1:09:09] another's throats, their fighting uh
[1:09:12] predicted they'd be there in the last
[1:09:14] day. And there they set Ishmael out
[1:09:17] there and about a city block here. And
[1:09:19] here's Isaac. And both of them, he said,
[1:09:22] Muhammadans and Jews are fighting one
[1:09:24] another in no man's land.
[1:09:28] In the message, you must be born again.
[1:09:30] He said, "I'm wondering this morning as
[1:09:33] we are gathered here, and I have I'm
[1:09:36] reading this because this is this is out
[1:09:39] of my heart. I'm wondering this morning
[1:09:42] as we are gathered here together,
[1:09:44] brothers and sisters and you ministers
[1:09:47] and Sunday school teachers and whatever
[1:09:50] you are, what does this all mean?
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Why are we here? And what's the great
[1:09:58] struggle?
[1:09:59] That's right.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Doesn't that fit everybody?
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Doesn't that fit everybody?
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Why are we here?
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; And I am asking that question because I
[1:10:12] want to also answer it because you were
[1:10:15] compelled by a strange spirit from
[1:10:19] another world,
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; from almighty God.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; You were compelled. You were directed in
[1:10:25] a in a way that you it was even
[1:10:27] mysterious to you. Some of you have come
[1:10:30] from different countries, from different
[1:10:32] parts of the world. How amazing that God
[1:10:35] has done it. And not because this is the
[1:10:38] only place. God works in one place and
[1:10:40] he works over the whole world at the
[1:10:42] same time. He said, "Let there be light
[1:10:45] and there was light."
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; I want you to remember that God speaks
[1:10:48] his word. It's effective over the whole
[1:10:51] earth.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; God can speak about the resurrection. He
[1:10:54] can speak about it whether it be in
[1:10:56] America or in Palestine. And it's going
[1:10:59] to happen. If he has it in his mind that
[1:11:02] not just one is going to come up, but
[1:11:04] the whole body is going to come up, then
[1:11:06] that's what's going to happen.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; And God's already knows exactly who's
[1:11:10] coming up in the first resurrection.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; And he knows who's coming up in the
[1:11:14] general resurrection. He knows all about
[1:11:17] it.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; You following me?
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; And so we're gathered to one.
[1:11:26] Thank you, brother Ellie, for your song.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Just want you to be mindful of this now
[1:11:33] and others that heard it.
[1:11:35] We're gathered here to one
[1:11:40] who spoke from another world.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; If you're gathered here just to hear me
[1:11:47] or another one of the ministers speak,
[1:11:50] it's really the wrong purpose. Amen.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; It doesn't fully answer
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; how you have been led.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; We've been gathered here because there
[1:12:02] is one true God.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; And he has given abundant and infallible
[1:12:09] infallible I say infallible evidence of
[1:12:13] his personal being and presence.
[1:12:17] We are here because that one has called
[1:12:21] us from another realm.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; From another world,
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; from another place, another dimension,
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; for the purpose of receiving us to
[1:12:32] himself,
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; that's why we are here.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; We're not here to have a church.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; We're not here just to have services.
[1:12:42] We're not here to have some formal kind
[1:12:45] of religion. We have left the formal
[1:12:48] religion. We have left the old dead
[1:12:51] formal religion. We are here because
[1:12:54] someone living has called us from
[1:12:57] another world and that we've heard that
[1:13:00] voice
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; and we're here and we've felt his
[1:13:03] presence
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; and we know his reality.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; We can say it's a message. We say it's
[1:13:10] Christ. We can say some say it's the
[1:13:13] Bible. I can say it's Jesus Christ.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; He's the word and the word was made
[1:13:18] flesh and dwelt among us. And that word
[1:13:21] said he'll send Malachi for and he sent
[1:13:24] a prophet messenger in this time with
[1:13:27] infallible proof.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Infallible proof
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; with a voice even till a man could say
[1:13:34] it's not my voice. It's it's someone
[1:13:36] else speaking. You've heard my voice,
[1:13:38] but it's not me speaking.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; I don't know these things. It's that one
[1:13:44] of all wisdom
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; and all knowing that has called you and
[1:13:50] that's why you're here. If we're here
[1:13:52] for any other reason, then we've missed
[1:13:53] the point
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; and we actually stand in jeopardy. This
[1:13:58] one has revealed
[1:14:00] has been revealed as the Lord Jesus
[1:14:03] Christ and is now gathering is now
[1:14:06] gathering has been and is gathering us
[1:14:10] to himself.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; You young people, you didn't come just
[1:14:14] to a young people's meeting or to a
[1:14:16] Sunday school. You've come because your
[1:14:19] teacher has heard this voice and is and
[1:14:22] your parents have heard this voice have
[1:14:25] heard this message and are seeking to
[1:14:27] bring it to you. Bring it making it a
[1:14:30] reality to you.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; There's more taking place
[1:14:35] this morning, even at this time that in
[1:14:39] the unseen world
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; than we can even begin to imagine or
[1:14:44] understand.
[1:14:46] And we need to be mindful of it. Even
[1:14:48] though we can't put it all together, we
[1:14:49] need to be mindful of it.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Brother Biscll, you're
[1:14:53] taking me way beyond my, you know, I I
[1:14:56] want something down here that's going to
[1:14:58] help me live today, tomorrow, and the
[1:14:59] next day." I'm trying to speak so to
[1:15:01] make sure you get on the other side.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to speak. You didn't come
[1:15:07] here by your own choice. You didn't say,
[1:15:09] you didn't have a choice. Same with the
[1:15:11] prisoners of war. You're in a trap.
[1:15:13] Brother Brandham says about the women of
[1:15:15] this age, he says, "They're caught in a
[1:15:17] web and I feel sorry for them."
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Aren't your sisters glad someone felt
[1:15:22] sorry for you?
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; You're caught in the web. You you know
[1:15:25] the the whole the whole thing is contra.
[1:15:28] If you want to live holy, this isn't the
[1:15:30] place.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; If you want to live a clean, holy,
[1:15:33] righteous life, everything in this world
[1:15:36] is opposed to that. If you want to just
[1:15:39] give yourself to to the darkness and to
[1:15:41] the world and the perversion, then you
[1:15:44] can you're at home.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; But if you're if you say I have a call
[1:15:48] and that call within me is for a holy
[1:15:51] God.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; And as when I pray, I don't pray as a
[1:15:55] formality. I say, let thy kingdom come.
[1:15:59] [Applause]
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Let thy will be done on earth as it is
[1:16:03] in heaven.
[1:16:05] Let righteousness rain.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Let purity rain.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Does your soul cry out for that
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; because that's what tells you you're not
[1:16:15] for this place.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; You didn't come here by your own
[1:16:19] choosing.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; You didn't come here as an accident.
[1:16:22] Your mother and father and the mother
[1:16:24] who bore you didn't even know. She
[1:16:26] didn't know what you were going to be
[1:16:27] like. God knew what you were going to be
[1:16:30] like. And God even saw your footsteps
[1:16:32] and saw your pathway and saw how you
[1:16:36] would make contact with this one or work
[1:16:38] or fly to that place or whatever more.
[1:16:40] He knew exactly how he was going to get
[1:16:42] you. But it's for us to be aware. This
[1:16:45] came from another world.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; And God sent a messenger that was in
[1:16:50] constant contact with the other world.
[1:16:53] Why did he do that? Because it was not
[1:16:57] it was not a man calling you. It was not
[1:17:00] a man orchestrating it. It was another
[1:17:03] movement from another realm say, "I'll
[1:17:06] pull them to me.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; I'll call them to me."
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; I don't leave you comfortless. I will
[1:17:16] come to you. That's the same one.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "In my father's house are many
[1:17:23] mansions. If it were not so, I would
[1:17:25] have told you. I go to prepare a place
[1:17:27] for you. And if I go and prepare a place
[1:17:29] for you, I will come again and receive
[1:17:33] you unto myself. How does he receive
[1:17:36] you? By sending his angel, his
[1:17:38] messenger. I'll send my messengers and
[1:17:41] they'll gather the elect
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; from the four corners of the earth.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; From the four winds, wherever they are,
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; I'll gather the elect,
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; and nothing could stand in front of
[1:17:56] their place.
[1:18:06] Apostle Paul said, "While we look at
[1:18:09] the things which are not were which are
[1:18:11] seen, while we look, I'm sorry. While we
[1:18:14] look not at the things which are seen,
[1:18:17] but at the things which are not seen,
[1:18:19] for the things which are seen are
[1:18:21] temporal." Everything you see is
[1:18:23] temporal.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; You see my body, it's temporal. We look
[1:18:27] at one another, we're temporal. We're
[1:18:29] just on a little journey, friends.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; This building here is just temporal.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Everything you see is temporal.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; But you have a soul inside you that's
[1:18:38] worth a million worlds.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; You have a seed in you
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; that came from God.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; If you have eternal life, you always had
[1:18:51] it.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; There's no beginning to eternal life.
[1:18:55] There's no end to it. You always had it.
[1:18:57] And that life called out for father.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Father, you sent me. What am I doing
[1:19:04] here?
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Potter, you sent me here.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; what is this all about?
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; What do you want me to do? What is my
[1:19:14] mission?
[1:19:22] And we we need to be conscious
[1:19:25] of the gathering the people. Who is
[1:19:27] gathering us? What are we being gathered
[1:19:29] for? And what are we being gathered to?
[1:19:33] Apostle Paul said in Romans 10:8, "And
[1:19:36] what sit?
[1:19:38] The word. The word is mighty." Now I'm
[1:19:41] going to go off into some swimming water
[1:19:42] and you can just I I can't answer all
[1:19:44] the questions but I do I want to pose
[1:19:46] some.
[1:19:49] The word is nye
[1:19:51] even in thy mouth and in thy heart that
[1:19:55] is the word of faith which we preach.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; And I've put here whatever that phrase
[1:20:01] means
[1:20:03] the word.
[1:20:04] We hear it hundreds and thousands of
[1:20:06] times. The word this and the word that
[1:20:08] and the word something else. And I think
[1:20:11] it possibly could have be used in
[1:20:14] different in different uh settings.
[1:20:22] Jesus answered and said unto them,
[1:20:24] "Verily I say unto you, if you have
[1:20:27] faith and doubt not,
[1:20:30] you shall not only do this which is done
[1:20:33] to the fig tree, but also if you shall
[1:20:38] say,
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:40] unto this mountain,
[1:20:43] be thou removed, and be cast into the
[1:20:46] sea, it shall be done.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; That's the words of one who cannot tell
[1:20:52] a lie.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; That's the words of Jesus Christ.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Not that we're on a mission. Of course,
[1:20:59] I know that we do things according to
[1:21:01] the will of God. But the but there are
[1:21:04] some things that we know are the will of
[1:21:07] God
[1:21:08] concerning our families,
[1:21:11] concerning the place where we worship,
[1:21:14] concerning our individual lives. We know
[1:21:17] what the will of God is concerning that.
[1:21:20] And there's every kind of force, every
[1:21:23] kind of influence, every kind of lying
[1:21:26] spirit, everything in the everything
[1:21:28] that even the mind of Satan can contrive
[1:21:32] to offset you and derail you.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; I say this word has power over all of
[1:21:39] that.
[1:21:42] And it's not God's intent that his
[1:21:46] children are bound and subjected to all
[1:21:49] the influences and the pressures of
[1:21:52] Satan's kingdom.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; My father, your father, created the
[1:21:59] whole universe.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; And if it's expanding, so be it.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; If there's more galaxies to come, so be
[1:22:06] it. But my father did it.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the beginning, God created the
[1:22:13] heaven and the earth. In the beginning,
[1:22:15] the one I worship created the heaven and
[1:22:17] the earth. In the beginning, my father,
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Papa God, created the heavens and the
[1:22:23] earth.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; The one I came from created the heavens
[1:22:27] and the earth. The one who has sent his
[1:22:30] own special messenger with a voice to
[1:22:33] attract me, my father, my father, Papa
[1:22:36] God. He's the one who did that because
[1:22:39] he wants me to come home
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; and I'm not happy here.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not pleased. I'm not at home down
[1:22:47] here.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; This world, this world is not my home.
[1:22:50] I'm just passing through.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Satan wants to bog you down. He wants to
[1:22:57] make you completely occupied with this
[1:22:59] place. And you're going to live here a
[1:23:00] very short time. I don't care what age
[1:23:02] you are. You're going to live here a
[1:23:04] very short time.
[1:23:07] We're not home here.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; We haven't been gathered behind this
[1:23:12] barb wire.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; On our own accord.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; We've been sent here. And even God
[1:23:18] himself allows Satan to put you in the
[1:23:21] fix that you get into. And you it's a
[1:23:24] whole lot less than the barb wire and
[1:23:26] the death camps that some of these
[1:23:27] people were in. But God allowed you that
[1:23:30] he might manifest his power in you and
[1:23:33] show you that he can deliver you and
[1:23:35] keep you.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to God.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give him praise today,
[1:23:43] friend.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Right in the face of the enemy.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; This is a devil's world.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; And he is he he's God of this evil age,
[1:23:53] the scripture tells us.
[1:23:56] But he's not God of us.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; And we're not here because he did
[1:24:01] anything.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; We're here in spite of him. We're here
[1:24:05] because our father said another voice
[1:24:10] [Music]
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; along this line.
[1:24:15] I'm going to watch watch my time and not
[1:24:18] be long, God willing.
[1:24:22] But I'd like to just take it from a
[1:24:24] little different direction for a moment.
[1:24:26] I'd like to put the emphasis upon the
[1:24:29] voice, the word of God.
[1:24:32] In the beginning, God created the heaven
[1:24:34] and the earth, and the earth was without
[1:24:37] form and void, and darkness was upon the
[1:24:40] face of the deep. And the spirit of God
[1:24:43] moved upon the waters. I want, please
[1:24:46] just stay with my thought and as little
[1:24:48] movement as possible.
[1:24:50] And the spirit of God moved on the face
[1:24:52] of the waters,
[1:24:54] on the face of the deep. And the spirit
[1:24:57] of God moved upon the face of the
[1:24:59] waters. And God said, "Let there be
[1:25:02] light." And there was light. Brother
[1:25:05] Brandham said, "If a fog came, it wasn't
[1:25:07] the word of God."
[1:25:09] If something else happened, it wasn't
[1:25:11] the word of God. Let there be light and
[1:25:13] there was it. It may not have come then.
[1:25:16] might not have come for 10,000 years, I
[1:25:19] don't know, or hundreds of years. But he
[1:25:21] said the reason he said that was because
[1:25:23] there was seeds.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; And the seeds Now, now here's where we
[1:25:28] where we maybe get a little bit in the
[1:25:30] swimming water.
[1:25:32] I don't know, did God speak Hebrew or or
[1:25:37] was there anything audible or who did he
[1:25:41] say it to?
[1:25:43] There was nothing living.
[1:25:46] I don't know. But there's there's
[1:25:47] there's an essence. There's something
[1:25:50] God
[1:25:52] is beyond all of our comprehension. But
[1:25:55] there's something that was able to the
[1:25:59] essence from his thought and mind moved
[1:26:02] out into a into a logos. The logos was
[1:26:06] the word and moved out of the bosom of
[1:26:08] God.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; And through this and that was called the
[1:26:11] son of God. and he be to create things.
[1:26:15] I can't put it down perhaps in in
[1:26:18] precise and define it exactly so but let
[1:26:22] us just say that the word of God in
[1:26:24] whatever that phrase comprises and
[1:26:26] whatever it involves the word of God
[1:26:29] however whatever essence or substance if
[1:26:32] it was a substance perhaps there was no
[1:26:34] substance yet but something came out
[1:26:37] from this great eternal being who fills
[1:26:39] all time and space who you can't and I
[1:26:41] can't comprehend neither can any man
[1:26:43] comprehend But something moved out of
[1:26:45] this being and said, "Let there be
[1:26:47] light."
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; And once that was once that was issued
[1:26:53] out of God,
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; in whatever form it came, audible or
[1:26:58] inaudible
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; uh or whatever language or no language,
[1:27:03] whatever came out from God, then one
[1:27:06] thing is certain, that precise thing is
[1:27:10] going to take place. Yeah,
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; that's the point I want to make. It's
[1:27:15] going to take place. If you get that
[1:27:18] really solidly in your mind and then you
[1:27:20] know that it was that God speaking
[1:27:22] through this man, then you know that's
[1:27:25] going to happen.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; And then when you find these people or
[1:27:30] some people who begin to question that
[1:27:34] voice that came through this vessel,
[1:27:37] they are on dangerous ground.
[1:27:40] In fact is they don't have any crown.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; This is the only eternal being there is.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; There is no other eternal being
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; other than God and his children.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; And there's none of the children that
[1:27:57] are going to say, "I don't think that
[1:27:59] was my father speaking."
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; If it was the father speaking.
[1:28:07] Amen.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; The true word of God.
[1:28:16] I'm saying some things. I hope you will
[1:28:18] take it very seriously because I'm
[1:28:20] saying some things that I've pondered
[1:28:23] and wrestled with.
[1:28:25] The true word of God possesses
[1:28:30] transforming power.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. within it
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; to bring about whatever was issued in
[1:28:37] that word thought.
[1:28:39] [Applause]
[1:28:41] It has within it wi-i contained within
[1:28:45] that word and it may not be an English
[1:28:48] word, a Hebrew word or any word but it
[1:28:50] is the thought of God that came into
[1:28:53] word form
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; and the that that word itself
[1:28:59] possesses within itself the power to
[1:29:04] transform
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; and to make what was in his mind.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It may come in seed form but
[1:29:12] it will end up in the full form of full
[1:29:15] manifestation. It might be a grain of
[1:29:18] when he said let the herb bring forth.
[1:29:21] He had wheat and barley and rye and
[1:29:24] every kind of plant and herb and and
[1:29:26] tree and fruit tree and let the seed and
[1:29:29] let the life be in the seed.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Let it be in its own seed so that it can
[1:29:34] reproduce and bring forth. All of that
[1:29:36] was in the mind of God once it was
[1:29:39] spoken. And the prophet said, "The
[1:29:40] reason why he said, "Let there be
[1:29:42] light," is because those seeds were
[1:29:45] laying down there.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; When he died at Calvary, your seed was
[1:29:52] laying someplace.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; And he had to go to Calvary to redeem
[1:29:58] and bring light to that seed.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; And there may be another seed. There may
[1:30:03] be another one that this light has not
[1:30:05] struck. And that light, oh my God, help
[1:30:08] me. But that light, he said, when you
[1:30:10] live the manifestation of the word by
[1:30:13] revelation to you, then you become
[1:30:16] light.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; And you have to cast that light on some
[1:30:21] seed that hasn't even come yet.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; But we are going to fulfill our purpose.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; We're going to fulfill our call.
[1:30:32] As the father hath sent me, so send I
[1:30:35] you. Now, do you know where I was coming
[1:30:37] from?
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; As the father hath sent me. And that's
[1:30:41] why at Calvary when and and the
[1:30:44] brutality
[1:30:45] of of the cross and and the how they
[1:30:48] were extinguishing his life and finally
[1:30:50] he could say, "It is finished."
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; And hung his head and gave up the ghost.
[1:30:58] Why? because the spirit that was in him
[1:31:01] had fulfilled every last iota of the
[1:31:03] promise
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; concerning him.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; But what was concerning him is not
[1:31:10] concerning you. You and I have our part
[1:31:13] to play.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; And I want to say today before God
[1:31:18] Almighty, Father, help us to realize and
[1:31:21] help these people to realize and help
[1:31:23] them to confess we shall fulfill our
[1:31:26] part. every part. I will not lax back. I
[1:31:30] shall fulfill my part.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Do I have your consent?
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; We're not here just to fulfill a
[1:31:38] position, a place, a father or mother or
[1:31:41] carpenter or worker or whatever we are.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; We're here to fulfill a much greater
[1:31:47] purpose.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; And even as we do our daily activities,
[1:31:52] we are a light.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; You are the light of the world. He said,
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; "So God spoke it." And what actually
[1:32:01] took place
[1:32:03] when God spoke it or what was involved
[1:32:07] in God speaking?
[1:32:10] His word is unknown. It's unknown to us.
[1:32:12] What, how, all of the aspects of it. But
[1:32:17] we do know that he spoke it. He said it.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; However, there was a materializing of
[1:32:23] what he said. Hallelujah.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; And then we saw what was in God's mind.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; There's a power in that act
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; to produce precisely what God had in his
[1:32:37] mind.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God spoke. It remains
[1:32:42] a mystery what the original act of
[1:32:46] speaking was. However, we have absolute
[1:32:50] evidence or proof that however it what
[1:32:54] and or however or whatever God spoke
[1:32:57] came into being.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; We are given to understand
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; that by his word that his word are seeds
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; and thus the seeds possess the power
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; within themselves to transform from seed
[1:33:13] to fullness of life.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:18] Are you with me?
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; The oak seed became an oak tree, not a
[1:33:24] palm tree.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; And the palm tree became an oak. It be a
[1:33:28] palm tree became a palm and not an oak.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; And he says in God's power to transform.
[1:33:33] Now he says now this word transformed.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; It's something that's changed.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; It's to be changed. Transformed. Made
[1:33:44] different than what it was. Amen.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Its character and everything has been
[1:33:49] changed in it to transform.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Said this world was without form and
[1:33:55] void.
[1:33:57] Darkness was upon the earth. Nothing but
[1:34:00] a complete chaos. And when this world
[1:34:03] was in that condition, the spirit of God
[1:34:05] moved upon the face of the water.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; And the entire picture was changed from
[1:34:10] a total chaos to a garden of Eden.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; That was because there was an essence.
[1:34:15] There was a power within that spoken
[1:34:18] word to produce that.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; I'm laying all this foundation. So, we
[1:34:22] come home to your address in just a few
[1:34:25] moments.
[1:34:28] And God said, "Let there be light." And
[1:34:30] there was light.
[1:34:32] That was God
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; in Mark. And Jesus moved with
[1:34:38] compassion, put forth his hand, and
[1:34:40] touched him, and Seth and Seth unto him.
[1:34:44] He didn't say to the whole earth.
[1:34:47] He didn't say to all humanity.
[1:34:50] He said to him,
[1:34:52] "I will
[1:34:54] be thou clean."
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; That's what he spoke. Be thou clean. Not
[1:35:00] in my language, not in your language,
[1:35:03] but in that language. So now God can
[1:35:05] speak in language. Brother Brandon says,
[1:35:07] "God can speak. God can hear.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; God can write.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; He wrote the commandments in stone. Oh,
[1:35:14] I tell you, he has technology that we
[1:35:16] know nothing about.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I will be thou clean." And
[1:35:22] as soon as he had spoken,
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; now the Hebrew language doesn't have
[1:35:28] that power. The Galilean language
[1:35:31] doesn't have that power.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Simple audible sound coming from a man's
[1:35:37] lips doesn't have that power.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; So where is that power? The word is nigh
[1:35:44] even in your mouth.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; That's what this book says.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Let's not call the Apostle Paul a liar.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Let's say the Apostle Paul is true.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Let's say God, you spoke through him and
[1:35:57] that's true.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; And the prophet in this day took the
[1:36:00] same scripture and said, "Speak.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Don't be backward." Right.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; I would like to see a congregation of
[1:36:09] people that were bold enough
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; to speak what the Holy Spirit will give
[1:36:15] them faith to believe.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; And as soon as he had spoken,
[1:36:21] immediately
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; the leprosy departed. What is this
[1:36:26] essence in this sound? What is this in
[1:36:29] this audible word that caused the whole
[1:36:32] cell system within a man's body and the
[1:36:35] lepers say left him immediately?
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; This is our God.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; This is who brought this message.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; This is who's going to bring you and
[1:36:47] change your body.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm preaching to give
[1:36:52] you faith to believe in that change
[1:36:55] because you've got to have faith to be
[1:36:57] raptured.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; We're preaching rapturing faith.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; You can stay here if you want. I don't
[1:37:05] want to stay here. I don't want to be in
[1:37:07] the tribulation. I don't want anything
[1:37:09] this world has to offer.
[1:37:18] Immediately the leprosy departed from
[1:37:20] him and he was cleansed.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; That's not a story. I read that. That's
[1:37:28] my father.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; That's your father.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Your God.
[1:37:41] He came then
[1:37:44] to the tomb of a man.
[1:37:47] Now this was a living man who was
[1:37:49] cleansed.
[1:37:51] Now we have Lazarus
[1:37:54] in a tomb
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; with a stone rolled over it. He's been
[1:38:00] there four days in that hot country and
[1:38:02] they don't embomb people.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; And he is already corruption set in. The
[1:38:08] prophet said his nose is already
[1:38:10] collapsed in this man is rotting.
[1:38:14] And when he had thus spoken
[1:38:17] Jesus in 11th ch 11th chapter and when
[1:38:19] he had thus had and when he thus had
[1:38:23] spoken he'd said some words where have
[1:38:26] you laid him and when he had thus spoken
[1:38:30] he cried
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; with a loud voice
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; voice
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Lazarus
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; come forth
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; and he that had been dead
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; something happened. You know what it
[1:38:43] was? The same word that said, "Let there
[1:38:45] be light," was here in a body
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; on earth.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; And death and Satan who had brought
[1:38:55] death had to become subject to him.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; And he reversed the power of Satan. He
[1:39:01] reversed the power of death and created
[1:39:04] again in him his organs and his body and
[1:39:08] his structure. And he came out.
[1:39:12] He could have said, "Come out loosed."
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; But there was something for the people
[1:39:16] to do. When he came out, they had bound
[1:39:18] him. So he said, "Loose him."
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; You loose him.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Something for you and I to do.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; You confess it.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; You say it.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Dust thou believe? You believe.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Can you deny Satan? Deny him.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; He's lying to you.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Deny him. He wants you to doubt this.
[1:39:40] deny him.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; That's the same God that spoke through
[1:39:46] this man we call our prophet William
[1:39:48] Brandham. The same God.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; That is why brother Wayey was raised
[1:39:56] from the dead.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Little fishy.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; God gives you life.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; And he flips over and continues to swim.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Squirrel after be a squirrel. The same
[1:40:10] one that brought Lazarus up, brought a
[1:40:12] squirrel on edge, on the limb.
[1:40:16] And that same God's calling you out of
[1:40:18] this death camp.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; He's calling you out of this death camp.
[1:40:24] [Applause]
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Behind the barb wire of this world. And
[1:40:30] the son of God has set you free.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Liberation time has come.
[1:40:38] Hallelujah.
[1:40:42] [Music]
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; If thou can't believe, say to this
[1:40:47] mountain,
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; that thing tried to control you, that
[1:40:51] spirit tried to lie to you, you tell him
[1:40:54] he's a liar
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; and the father of lies,
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; and you will not accept it.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; I won't have this spirit on me anymore.
[1:41:06] I won't have this devil
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; try to trap my life any longer.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; When that prophet's message came and
[1:41:16] those people were liberated out of their
[1:41:18] out of their literal camp, that was a
[1:41:20] sign. That was Naomi's group.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; What about Ruth's group?
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Naomi got her inheritance, but Ruth got
[1:41:28] Boaz.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Ruth got him.
[1:41:37] They got their land. They got their
[1:41:39] nation. They got their flag. But we got
[1:41:42] the redeemer.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; We got the lover. We got the Boaz.
[1:41:47] [Music]
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Just give me Jesus.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Give me Jesus.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Give me this living word.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Give me this living spirit.
[1:42:03] giving me this breath of life.
[1:42:09] [Applause]
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Now that was in one specific location
[1:42:26] and Jesus had to journey there to come
[1:42:29] to that tool.
[1:42:32] Then Jesus said
[1:42:34] after his resurrection and he was
[1:42:36] getting ready to depart,
[1:42:39] he specifies another place and he says,
[1:42:41] "Now tarry in Jerusalem.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Go to that city and you stay there
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; until you're endued with power from on
[1:42:52] high."
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; So a group of people, 120 of them of all
[1:42:56] that heard him, and there were many more
[1:42:59] that heard him. So it goes to show and
[1:43:01] it behooves us friends.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; It behooves us to be serious.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Am I part of the 120?
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Or am I part of another group that just
[1:43:13] I heard the Galilean speak? Yes. And I
[1:43:17] knew supernaturally he had raised I knew
[1:43:19] he was a well I even I believe he was a
[1:43:22] prophet.
[1:43:25] There's people who say I'm in the
[1:43:27] message. I don't like that phrase. I'm
[1:43:29] not interested whether you're in the
[1:43:31] message. What is that? What does that
[1:43:32] mean?
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; You've got to have this living word in
[1:43:35] you.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; You've got to be You got to have the
[1:43:39] message in you.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; I'm in the church or I'm in this or I'm
[1:43:44] in something else. Nonsense.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Excuse me for being blunt, but I I'm
[1:43:49] going to just speak my heart.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; You got to have that word in you. Yeah.
[1:43:55] And
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; if you have that word in you, you'll be
[1:43:56] living that life
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; because that word, whatever it is,
[1:44:00] whatever that word is, it contains
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; and has the very essence of almighty
[1:44:06] God, eternal power.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; You possess that.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Now, there's a lot of people believe the
[1:44:18] Bible, but they don't have the word.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Understand? I'm making a distinction
[1:44:24] between just the mechanics. The letter
[1:44:27] kleth. In other words, what? The word
[1:44:29] kleth.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Just the letter of the word kleth. But
[1:44:33] the spirit gives life.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; And so he says, "Go to Jerusalem and
[1:44:41] tarry
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; until you be endued."
[1:44:44] And the scripture tells us that they
[1:44:46] were gathered. They were assembled in
[1:44:48] one in one accord. And suddenly,
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; there came a sound from heaven
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; as of a rushing mighty wind
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; and it filled all the house
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; where they were sitting.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; The same God could have said
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; now could have spoke through Jesus and
[1:45:10] said, "Now I send the spirit, the
[1:45:13] promise of the father upon you and it'll
[1:45:15] just cover the whole earth."
[1:45:18] Well, it didn't do it right then. It
[1:45:20] came it came to the room where they were
[1:45:24] sitting and they were all filled and
[1:45:27] they were told, "Now you go and tell
[1:45:30] it."
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, this is a glorious message."
[1:45:37] And God found me. Yeah, he did. He found
[1:45:40] you. He knew precisely where you were.
[1:45:42] And then he filled you for a purpose.
[1:45:45] And when you heard the word and it
[1:45:47] became alive to you, then he quickened
[1:45:49] you to go and tell it and to live it.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Why were they there sitting?
[1:46:11] Like why are you here sitting?
[1:46:14] Well, they were there sitting because
[1:46:16] they were expecting something.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; If you're just expecting church, that's
[1:46:22] just exactly what you're going to get.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Well, I went to church this morning.
[1:46:27] Good for you.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Have a happy two and a half hours or
[1:46:31] whatever. No, I went to church.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; I became transfigured.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I received transforming
[1:46:41] power.
[1:46:43] In fact is I can't wait to get out of
[1:46:45] here and give that devil a black eye.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give him trouble.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; I'm getting on his case.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going on the offensive.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Not on the defensive. Oh, you know, I've
[1:46:59] had such a hard time and oh, listen.
[1:47:02] Let's get over that.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Everybody has a hard time.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; We've all had those times. But let's
[1:47:09] become on the offensive. I'm going after
[1:47:12] him.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; They had come under the voice of the
[1:47:19] creator.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Those that were sitting there had come
[1:47:23] under the voice of the creator.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Who made all things and they were
[1:47:30] sitting there waiting for the
[1:47:32] fulfillment or the transforming power of
[1:47:34] that voice to happen.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:38] And the Bible tells us,
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Peter speaking, "And he commanded us to
[1:47:44] preach unto the people,
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; and to testify that it is he which was
[1:47:49] ordained of God, to be judge of the
[1:47:53] quick uh to uh to be the judge of the of
[1:47:56] quick and dead. To him give all the
[1:47:59] prophets witness,
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; that though his name and through his
[1:48:02] name, whosoever believeth in him shall
[1:48:05] receive remission of sins,
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; and while Peter yet spake,
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; now Peter's speaking,
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; it's not God said in the beginning. It's
[1:48:15] not Jesus. It's not Moses. Now it's
[1:48:18] Peter.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Peter who just a few days ago cursed.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:28] Hallelujah.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Come on, holy, righteous ones.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; But now he was full of the Holy Ghost.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; He put that behind him.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; He never repeated it again.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; And while he spake these words, the Holy
[1:48:51] Ghost, that's the spirit of the creator.
[1:48:54] And the spirit of God moved over the
[1:48:56] face of the whole deep. Now that Holy
[1:48:58] Spirit, that spirit is right there in
[1:49:00] the room.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; And it says, "And the Holy Ghost fell on
[1:49:06] all them which heard the word."
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; They weren't just hearing some words.
[1:49:13] They were hearing the word.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Coming now through a vessel,
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; a redeemed vessel
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; full of the Holy Ghost. And while he
[1:49:23] spake, the creator, the spirit of
[1:49:26] creation came upon them that heard the
[1:49:29] word.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, if I'm speaking my own
[1:49:33] thoughts today, then it'll do nothing
[1:49:35] for you. If you receive it as something
[1:49:37] coming from God, you can receive
[1:49:39] something divine this morning.
[1:49:45] Hallelujah.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; There were certain conditions. I'm
[1:49:52] moving forward as as quickly as possible
[1:49:55] now. There were certain conditions that
[1:49:59] would have to spread over the whole
[1:50:00] earth
[1:50:02] at the season or the time of the coming
[1:50:04] of the revealing of the son of man.
[1:50:07] heaven.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says Jesus speaking,
[1:50:12] "Heaven and earth shall pass away in
[1:50:15] Luke 21." Heaven and earth shall pass
[1:50:17] away, but my words
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; shall not pass away. And take heed to
[1:50:22] yourselves, lest at any time your hearts
[1:50:25] be overcharged with serpenting and
[1:50:26] drunkenness and cares of this life, and
[1:50:29] so that day come upon you unawares. What
[1:50:32] day?
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; What snares?
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It says, "Heaven and earth
[1:50:37] shall pass away, but my word shall not
[1:50:39] pass away. For as a snare shall it come
[1:50:41] on all them that dwell on the face of
[1:50:44] the whole earth." You know, it could be
[1:50:47] taking place and probably is taking
[1:50:49] place at this moment.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; The earth is filled
[1:50:54] with violence.
[1:51:00] It's filled
[1:51:03] with the deepest and the most perverted
[1:51:08] uncleanness.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Until godly people have a good reason to
[1:51:14] be concerned. Those of you with
[1:51:16] families, we're concerned about our
[1:51:18] families.
[1:51:20] We're concerned about our partners, our
[1:51:23] other
[1:51:25] brothers and sisters in Christ. We're
[1:51:27] concerned about them.
[1:51:30] As parents, we're concerned about our
[1:51:32] young people.
[1:51:36] We have good reason to be.
[1:51:39] This school building out here, that's
[1:51:41] not just a pile of concrete.
[1:51:44] I can tell you what. If we can preserve,
[1:51:48] if you can preserve your children from
[1:51:51] the influence
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; of this world,
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; my counsel to you is do so.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. If there's any possibility, if
[1:52:01] there's any possible way you can
[1:52:02] preserve them and you as other believers
[1:52:07] to do whatever you can do,
[1:52:10] I can tell you that Israel did not have
[1:52:15] the Canaanites and the Gegosites and the
[1:52:17] Perizzites and all the other itesites
[1:52:22] teaching their children
[1:52:24] that we'll trust them to you. That was
[1:52:26] not the case.
[1:52:28] This is only a sideline. I'm only just
[1:52:31] tossing that in for the moment.
[1:52:35] As a snare, it shall come on all them
[1:52:38] that dwell on the face of the earth.
[1:52:43] We could become very negative at this
[1:52:46] time.
[1:52:48] There's floods,
[1:52:50] there's earthquakes,
[1:52:53] there is nuclear nuclear meltdowns.
[1:52:59] There is contamination on our shores, on
[1:53:03] our beaches.
[1:53:05] I don't know if you've thought about it,
[1:53:07] but the salmon you eat and the salmon
[1:53:09] that I love to eat, it leaves our shores
[1:53:13] and these rivers, and it takes a 4-year
[1:53:16] journey to Japan.
[1:53:18] And Japan's waters are absolutely
[1:53:22] polluted
[1:53:23] with radioactivity
[1:53:26] for many, many miles out in the ocean.
[1:53:29] And for us to think that those salmon
[1:53:30] are going, nobody's told me this. I
[1:53:32] haven't read it. But if you think that
[1:53:34] our salmon going to swim and feed over
[1:53:36] there and grow to be from fingerlings to
[1:53:40] big salmon and come back and not be
[1:53:43] affected,
[1:53:45] we were listening to a tape this last
[1:53:47] week and brother Brandham speaks about
[1:53:52] the hybriding.
[1:53:56] Now he talks about the hybriding of food
[1:53:59] and what it does to our bodies.
[1:54:02] And I said to my wife, "That's why we
[1:54:04] pray, but we we we still do everything
[1:54:05] we can to eat healthy."
[1:54:09] But he says, "The hybriding of the
[1:54:10] food,"
[1:54:12] he says it it it actually is destroying
[1:54:14] us and turning us just to
[1:54:18] unhealthy people.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And remember,
[1:54:23] the brain is also cells." He says, "The
[1:54:26] brain is also flesh."
[1:54:30] And you know, you look at brother Ed up
[1:54:33] here. I lived I lived till I was way
[1:54:36] into my adult life before I ever heard
[1:54:38] the word Alzheimer's.
[1:54:44] I lived till I was in high school before
[1:54:46] I heard the first case of leukemia.
[1:54:51] And that cancer is a demon of this age.
[1:54:56] For when an angel from God came
[1:55:00] and stands h in bodily form
[1:55:04] before our prophet
[1:55:07] and said, "I've been sent from the
[1:55:08] presence of God to tell you that you
[1:55:12] will take a ministry of healing to the
[1:55:15] world and you'll stand before kings and
[1:55:18] potentates and so on." and then over the
[1:55:21] Ohio River a voice
[1:55:26] nothing will stand before if you can get
[1:55:28] the people to believe
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; nothing will stand before your prayers
[1:55:32] in other words nothing will stand before
[1:55:34] your words
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; not even cancer
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; why did an angel from God's presence say
[1:55:41] not even cancer it's a demon of this
[1:55:45] generation
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; and we need to have a congregation of
[1:55:50] people that recognize that and believes
[1:55:54] against it.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; We're in opposition
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; as a praying people.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; As a believing people,
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; we're in opposition.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; We don't just want to call when we hear
[1:56:06] about it. We want to know now that we're
[1:56:09] against it.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; We're in opposition to it. Why? Because
[1:56:13] we have received the voice of the
[1:56:16] creator.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; The creator. Amen.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; He could have said, "Let there be
[1:56:22] another galaxy." But he chose to say
[1:56:24] instead, "Not even cancer will stand
[1:56:27] before you."
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; And I receive that word.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; I receive that word in the name of Jesus
[1:56:34] Christ before these people as a
[1:56:37] testimony. I'm not preaching. I'm making
[1:56:39] a declaration. I receive this message.
[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:45] Amen.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; We were speaking yesterday with some
[1:56:52] folks that are sitting right here
[1:56:54] and they have friends far far away.
[1:56:58] After 16 years in the message, they just
[1:57:00] left the message,
[1:57:02] went back to a Pentecostal church, I
[1:57:04] believe it was. So, how does this
[1:57:06] happen?
[1:57:08] Well, I can tell you one thing that
[1:57:10] happens for absolutely certain that
[1:57:14] message didn't become
[1:57:17] uh they weren't birthed by this word.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; And when you ever hear or see even
[1:57:24] evidence of people drifting back, I can
[1:57:29] tell you, you say what you wish, it's
[1:57:32] Orpa
[1:57:34] going back to her gods and her people
[1:57:36] again. The heart has gone back.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Already gone back. May physically they
[1:57:42] maybe they could sit in a they could sit
[1:57:44] in a message church. Doesn't mean a
[1:57:46] thing to me.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean a thing. It's what's in
[1:57:49] your heart.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; And I'm seeking to plant into your very
[1:57:53] being.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; The fullness of this word.
[1:57:58] And while one might say, and I've heard
[1:58:00] it said even recently, that the the
[1:58:03] Bible is their absolute, the message is
[1:58:07] no longer their absolute. That's a very
[1:58:09] dangerous statement. And I'll I'll tell
[1:58:12] you I'll tell you what I do with
[1:58:13] statements like that because I've heard
[1:58:15] those statements 30 years ago at where
[1:58:18] people make a distinction.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; They make a distinction between the
[1:58:23] Bible and the message. Yeah.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Then I have a threeletter word and it's
[1:58:29] why.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Why does that person or why does that
[1:58:35] group make a distinction between the
[1:58:38] Bible and the message? It's simply
[1:58:41] because and I'm giving you the direct
[1:58:43] answer and deep in their heart is
[1:58:46] because they do not believe that the
[1:58:48] message is the perfect revelation of the
[1:58:52] word of God.
[1:58:54] And they have their own thought that
[1:58:56] they want to interject which is
[1:58:58] different from the message and from the
[1:59:01] word.
[1:59:02] [Applause]
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Might as well say amen.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely the truth.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Then that causes an individual to lift
[1:59:16] themselves up
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; as someone who can give the
[1:59:19] interpretation of what this is as an
[1:59:21] absolute.
[1:59:24] If you're going to if you're going to
[1:59:26] say and I've said it myself when brother
[1:59:28] Brandham preached the absolute he held
[1:59:29] the Bible in his hand because the Bible
[1:59:32] is the absolute. But the second part of
[1:59:34] that is he said in this day we have the
[1:59:38] perfect interpretation
[1:59:40] of the Bible.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:46] And that's why we immerse ourselves
[1:59:48] within the message of the hour because
[1:59:51] it is the perfect interpretation of the
[1:59:54] absolute.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Hey, we've had the we've had the
[1:59:59] absolute for a thousand 2,000 years.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; And men have given their lives and they
[2:00:05] become theologians about this and they
[2:00:08] don't agree.
[2:00:11] They don't agree because they haven't
[2:00:13] got the author of the book. But now you
[2:00:16] have a messenger, but the author of the
[2:00:18] book speaking through him.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; And you know he's speaking through him
[2:00:25] because he tells you, tells me, tells
[2:00:27] others the very secret of their heart
[2:00:29] while the word is being spoken. You've
[2:00:32] experienced it. I've experienced it.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; And we have the secret of our heart.
[2:00:37] Then we have to conclude this wisdom
[2:00:39] comes from another world.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; And speak the word and the cancer falls
[2:00:45] off.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; A lot of people who don't believe the
[2:00:48] message get healing. Brother Brandham
[2:00:50] says prostitute will come up and get
[2:00:52] healed and a godly woman won't get
[2:00:54] healed because healing operates by faith
[2:00:58] and faith is a law. If you believe it
[2:01:01] shall be.
[2:01:03] doesn't say if you're a nice person, if
[2:01:04] you go to church, if you pay your tithe,
[2:01:06] if you're if you're free from sin,
[2:01:08] doesn't say that. Just says if you
[2:01:10] believe it,
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; you'll be healed.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; So, the fact people have all kinds of
[2:01:16] miracles and so on, that's not it. But
[2:01:18] when you can speak a word and breathe a
[2:01:22] word that gives a perfect interpretation
[2:01:25] to the absolute, then you have an
[2:01:28] absolute. You have a you have something
[2:01:30] like it's an oath and it's sworn on the
[2:01:32] oath.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; I hope it sings indeed.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; And that's the only way
[2:01:55] we can do what we're called to do. where
[2:01:58] he said
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; I finished the work
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; that you sent me to do.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; That's where I was coming from last
[2:02:05] week. Now then we that's the only way we
[2:02:08] can say that
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; I've received the same spirit.
[2:02:13] The author dwells in me
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; and now I proceed with my life. And now
[2:02:20] let me say something just comes quickly
[2:02:22] to my mind.
[2:02:25] This is sent to the elect, to the
[2:02:28] chosen, to the I try to find. I'll just
[2:02:33] leave it.
[2:02:35] But when we say that
[2:02:39] we're elect,
[2:02:41] that doesn't mean that we're proud or
[2:02:43] that we are
[2:02:45] to be conceited.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with that. You just
[2:02:50] know who you are
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; and you just go and live your life
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; and live your life peacefully
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; and go with that knowledge. This word
[2:02:59] came to me.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; This living Christ came to me.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30, Malachi 4, whoever, whatever
[2:03:06] identification you want to give it, but
[2:03:08] it came to me.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; And I don't know about others. I will do
[2:03:12] all that I can do to be a light
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; as he said in things that are to be the
[2:03:18] gene of your life. I quoted it from I'm
[2:03:20] quoting it from last Sunday. The gene of
[2:03:23] your life, the spiritual life tonight
[2:03:25] was in God the Father
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; before there was even a molecule.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Before there was a molecule.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; The gene of your life, your spiritual
[2:03:37] life that's in you was first in God
[2:03:40] before there was a molecule. Before
[2:03:41] there was an earth, before there was
[2:03:43] anything.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And he also for ordained
[2:03:47] men." Amen.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[2:03:50] And you are nothing but You are nothing
[2:03:53] but the manifestation
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; of the gene of life that was in God as a
[2:03:58] son of God.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; And now you're expressed after his word
[2:04:03] has come into you
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; to light up this age. How did his word
[2:04:07] come into you? It had to be said. It had
[2:04:09] to be spoken.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; And you were English or French or German
[2:04:13] or some other language and it came in
[2:04:16] your language.
[2:04:17] I had an experience.
[2:04:20] There was a pastor, a minister,
[2:04:22] well-known minister. Some of you know
[2:04:25] him very well. And I had about six or
[2:04:28] seven people. I had brother Leon, I
[2:04:31] believe it was, and brother Milco and
[2:04:33] several.
[2:04:36] And I felt to do that when I was in
[2:04:37] Missouri. I've only done it only did it
[2:04:39] here once and did it down there. And I
[2:04:41] wanted them all
[2:04:44] to speak Acts 2:38.
[2:04:48] Repent and be baptized every one of you
[2:04:50] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[2:04:52] remission of your sins and you shall
[2:04:53] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. And
[2:04:55] I had them all speak it in their own
[2:04:58] language. And there's hardly anybody
[2:05:00] understood. I had one woman in Missouri.
[2:05:03] She came up. I said,
[2:05:06] "What lang what what what language do
[2:05:08] you speak?" She says, "I speak four.
[2:05:11] Well, I said, "Let's just pick one of
[2:05:12] them."
[2:05:14] And so we had Romanian and Croatian or
[2:05:18] whatever. We had them put five or six
[2:05:20] lined up in French. And they all just
[2:05:23] blurt out these words and the people
[2:05:25] just they don't know what it is.
[2:05:30] Nobody's responding.
[2:05:35] pastor came to me after and he said that
[2:05:38] I traveled here for this answer. He said
[2:05:43] I was trying to wanting to do something
[2:05:44] for God. He says and I got I got a log
[2:05:48] jam. I just couldn't go any further
[2:05:50] because he says it was I thought that
[2:05:53] you know the the people will have to
[2:05:55] hear the the voice in their ear.
[2:05:59] But hey, most of the world doesn't
[2:06:02] understand English. They don't
[2:06:03] understand brother Bram's tapes.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, you say, "Well, it gets
[2:06:06] interpreted." Yeah, it gets interpreted.
[2:06:08] Now they're hearing completely different
[2:06:09] sound,
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; But the same the same scripture produces
[2:06:16] the same thing because it's the essence
[2:06:19] of what's in that word.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; The transforming power is not in
[2:06:23] English.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; It's not in French. It's not in German
[2:06:26] or any other language. The
[2:06:28] transformation power is in the
[2:06:30] revelation of what was said.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Is it okay?
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he reached you?
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:52] And I won't go any further because now
[2:06:54] we now we come to the point where I just
[2:06:57] thought it was just a perfect place to
[2:07:00] go into. And now God has allotted God.
[2:07:04] This same wise God and you can be
[2:07:06] thinking about this. I touched on it
[2:07:08] last Sunday, but he allotted.
[2:07:10] That's an allotment.
[2:07:13] He gave a specific allotment to you.
[2:07:17] No one else
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; can live your part.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. The only part that I have a little
[2:07:22] struggle with is if we don't do good,
[2:07:25] well, the Bible speaks about rewards.
[2:07:27] So, the reward won't be the same. But
[2:07:29] you live fervently. the part that God
[2:07:33] and I want to establish this morning
[2:07:35] before we close that
[2:07:38] if you can get it resolved. I mean
[2:07:42] absolutely resolved that we believe this
[2:07:46] message because it came from another
[2:07:49] world.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; It came divinely sent.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; It came beyond man's wisdom. It came
[2:07:57] even beyond, as brother Benham says,
[2:07:59] went beyond his own his own better
[2:08:02] judgment.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; He thought things over, but it went
[2:08:05] beyond that. I thank God it went beyond
[2:08:08] man's wisdom.
[2:08:11] And he said it whether it fit the people
[2:08:14] or whether they like to what they heard
[2:08:16] or whether they as we heard in he
[2:08:18] speaking in Phoenix the other day and
[2:08:20] and and and preaching and I can tell you
[2:08:22] those people are so silent because he's
[2:08:25] blasting the denominations. Why? Because
[2:08:28] the denominations become those men's
[2:08:30] absolute and the word of God, the
[2:08:32] perfect interpretation of the word is
[2:08:34] coming right out of his mouth and
[2:08:36] they're rejecting it.
[2:08:39] They want like children, you know, pipe
[2:08:42] us a nice music and show us a sign and
[2:08:45] tell us the secret of our heart and heal
[2:08:48] somebody and oh, they get all taken with
[2:08:50] that.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; But that's not what it's about. It's
[2:08:53] about what he said.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; And the essence of the word that he
[2:08:57] spoke.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're so thankful.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad for this word. Aren't you?
[2:09:07] Let's stand to our feet, shall we?
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; Let's just take a moment
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; to thank him.
[2:09:33] We thank you, Father.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you for sending it. Why don't you
[2:09:39] thank him for sending it to you?
[2:09:42] Forget who's beside you. You just thank
[2:09:44] him. Say, "Jesus,
[2:09:46] thank you for coming to me.
[2:09:49] Thank you for coming to me. Thank you
[2:09:52] for bringing it to me. Thank you for
[2:09:53] opening up my darkened heart, oh God,
[2:09:58] quickening me.
[2:10:02] I wonder if we could just sing like to
[2:10:05] sing that chorus. He came to me. He came
[2:10:07] to me. When I couldn't come to him, he
[2:10:11] came to me.
[2:10:18] [Music]
[2:10:23] If this is your testimony then you can
[2:10:27] you sing it as it is your testimony.
[2:10:31] [Music]
[2:10:42] to me.
[2:10:48] When I could not come
[2:10:52] to where he was,
[2:10:55] he came
[2:10:57] to me.
[2:11:00] [Music]
[2:11:03] That's why he died
[2:11:09] on Calary.
[2:11:12] [Music]
[2:11:17] When I could not come
[2:11:21] to where he was,
[2:11:24] he came to me.
[2:11:28] Now, before we sing it again, I want you
[2:11:30] to think while we even say these words.
[2:11:34] I'd like you to think in your own life,
[2:11:36] the spot, the place where it was that he
[2:11:41] actually came to you. I look back and
[2:11:44] see sister Sally Dodd Senior and her and
[2:11:48] brother Edwin
[2:11:50] and Sister Sally has a phrase all the
[2:11:53] time when he caught up to us.
[2:11:56] when he caught up to us and she has said
[2:11:58] it to us probably dozens and dozens of
[2:12:02] times and it was branded my heart
[2:12:07] when he caught up to us said to Sally
[2:12:10] great brother Edwin Forest we're so glad
[2:12:13] he caught up to you
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; you were on your way and you were in you
[2:12:19] know all in the societies and all the
[2:12:21] rest of it that he caught up with you
[2:12:25] I know there's some when you were in
[2:12:27] your workplace
[2:12:29] and he caught up to you. I came into a a
[2:12:33] a petrol station in Cape Town, South
[2:12:36] Africa
[2:12:37] and there was a black man sitting there
[2:12:39] and he was sitting reading a a I looked
[2:12:42] he was reading this little pamphlet. I
[2:12:44] looked it was a message book.
[2:12:47] I opened the window and got out. I said
[2:12:51] it's a good book. Yes. He said that's a
[2:12:53] good book. I says, "Where'd you get it?"
[2:12:56] He says, "In the trash can." Somebody
[2:12:58] cleaned out their car and threw it in
[2:13:00] the trash can. So for one person, it was
[2:13:03] trash and the other person it was. It
[2:13:05] was a wonderful thing.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; He came to you. He came to me.
[2:13:11] [Music]
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; He caught up with us.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; He came to me.
[2:13:21] Oh, he came
[2:13:24] to me
[2:13:29] when I could not come
[2:13:34] to where he was.
[2:13:37] He came to me
[2:13:44] and that's why he died.
[2:13:51] on Calary.
[2:13:53] [Music]
[2:13:58] When I could not come
[2:14:03] to where he was,
[2:14:06] he came for me.
[2:14:09] [Music]
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; I'd like to sing a chorus of that song
[2:14:14] 468. Had it not been
[2:14:18] for a place called Mount Calvary, had it
[2:14:20] not been,
[2:14:28] it not been
[2:14:31] for a place called bound free.
[2:14:38] And had it not been
[2:14:41] for the old rock.
[2:14:48] And had it not been for a man
[2:14:53] called Jesus.
[2:14:58] And forever
[2:15:01] my soul will be.
[2:15:07] Oh, had it not been so thankful for a
[2:15:11] place called Mount Calary.
[2:15:17] and had it not been
[2:15:20] for the old rock.
[2:15:24] [Music]
[2:15:27] And had it not been for a man
[2:15:32] called Jesus,
[2:15:36] then forever
[2:15:40] my soul would be lost.
[2:15:47] Hallelujah.
[2:15:48] [Music]
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus.
[2:15:53] Thank
[2:15:54] you Lord
[2:15:57] for saving
[2:16:00] us.
[2:16:04] Thank
[2:16:06] you Lord
[2:16:08] for making
[2:16:11] me home.
[2:16:14] Thank
[2:16:16] you Lord
[2:16:19] for giving
[2:16:21] to me.
[2:16:25] I bring salvation
[2:16:30] so rich
[2:16:32] and free.
[2:16:36] Our dear Lord Jesus,
[2:16:39] I ask
[2:16:40] I'm asking expressly
[2:16:44] that you'll go with every person.
[2:16:49] Father,
[2:16:51] lift the heavy load.
[2:16:54] There are situations, oh God, that we
[2:16:56] that weigh heavy upon our heart
[2:16:59] and we ask you to intervene
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; in a supernatural way.
[2:17:05] We agree and testify you're the
[2:17:07] Almighty.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; We speak your word by saying, "Greater
[2:17:12] is he that is in you than he that is in
[2:17:14] the world. Greater is he that is in you,
[2:17:18] church, than he that's in the world. You
[2:17:21] that might be down or you that might be
[2:17:24] almost at a place of defeat. I say
[2:17:26] greater is he that is in you." These are
[2:17:29] the words of Jesus Christ, your
[2:17:32] shepherd. Lord Jesus, I ask that you
[2:17:36] will be in attendance, be near. May your
[2:17:41] presence be felt. Oh God, I pray you'll
[2:17:45] change the atmosphere in homes. Change
[2:17:48] the atmosphere as the as your children
[2:17:50] move about. And may they realize that
[2:17:53] the one that is in them is greater than
[2:17:55] the environment.
[2:17:57] Greater than any opposition.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Greater greater is he.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. You're the creator.
[2:18:06] You even you even created Lucifer in the
[2:18:10] day he was created. And you'll be the
[2:18:12] one that'll destroy him.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; The tempter shall be destroyed. Thank
[2:18:19] you, Father. I pray in the name of Jesus
[2:18:22] Christ, you'll have a people on earth
[2:18:24] that will believe you, Lord, after all
[2:18:26] this evidence that has come after all
[2:18:28] this infallible evidence that has been
[2:18:31] you have presented to us that we'll
[2:18:33] believe it.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; With all of our heart and soul, Lord,
[2:18:37] let us be fanatics for the gospel.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to your name.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; You're worthy, worthy, worthy. And we
[2:18:45] want to go praising you. I pray that
[2:18:46] you'll give safe journey to the people
[2:18:49] that you'll bless the service tonight.
[2:18:51] Oh God, here and the service this
[2:18:53] afternoon in Seattle. Thank you for
[2:18:56] providing the place that you've provided
[2:18:58] just in the nick of time. Oh God, just
[2:19:01] when we needed it here, you provided it.
[2:19:03] Thank you, Father. Bless the people as
[2:19:05] they gather. And now as we're dismissed,
[2:19:08] thank you for all the kind attention of
[2:19:11] the people. I pray that you'll bless
[2:19:13] them for it

[2:19:32] a note paper and put it into the office
[2:19:35] and I'll try to do better. God bless
[2:19:38] you. You're dismissed in Jesus name.
