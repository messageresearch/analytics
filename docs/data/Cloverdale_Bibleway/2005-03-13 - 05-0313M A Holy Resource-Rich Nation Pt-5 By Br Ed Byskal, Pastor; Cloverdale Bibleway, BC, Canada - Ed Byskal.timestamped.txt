[10:48] I'm ask brother Jim Hayes. Brother Jim,
[10:50] if you'd come just open the service in a
[10:52] word of prayer. We have a couple of
[10:54] testimonies.
[10:56] Sister Roxanne Hoffman just has a quick
[10:59] word. She wishes to give praise and
[11:01] glory to my Lord and Savior for the p
[11:04] for this past weeks. It has been uh 3
[11:07] years since he's delivered me from
[11:09] seizures. She wants to give God all the
[11:12] glory.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And brother Hugh Mesa just
[11:15] has a quick testimony here. He wishes to
[11:17] thanks the saints for their prayers.
[11:19] Sylvia's sister asked the saints to move
[11:22] on the hearts of the abductors and to
[11:25] release the man known as Arnold. Uh the
[11:27] man is now freed. Praise the Lord.
[11:30] Please continue to pray for Max and
[11:32] Dorine first as they that they may
[11:35] return back to Canada. So we would just
[11:37] want to remember that little request.
[11:40] Brother Jake Dick has a note here.
[11:42] Please pray for Sister Mina Dick. She's
[11:45] still in the hospital and very weak, but
[11:47] she is doing much better. Says, "God
[11:50] bless you."
[11:52] And brother Serge has a little note
[11:53] here. Please pray for a friend of mine,
[11:56] Martin, who's going through a divorce
[11:57] and a custody situation. His main
[12:00] concern is that his children will grow
[12:01] up in a Christian environment, and he
[12:03] gladly accept Brother Serge's offer that
[12:06] we'd have a prayer request for him. So,
[12:07] we want to remember this man by the name
[12:10] of Martin. If you've got a need this
[12:12] morning, just raise your hand, your
[12:13] heart. As we go to prayer, if you're on
[12:15] the internet, on the telephone, hookup,
[12:17] won't you stand with us as we go to
[12:19] prayer? Brother Jim, if you'd come.
[12:23] [Music]
[12:26] Amen. Let's pray together.
[12:29] Heavenly Father, it's a privilege and
[12:31] honor to be here this morning, oh God,

[24:01] let's sing that chorus once again. Be
[24:03] fine. Oh, we'll not leave our little
[24:08] ones behind.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; For our father
[24:15] in mind.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Some are weak and some are cable. Others
[24:23] may not feel the will not leave a single

[24:38] [Music]

[24:45] [Applause]
[24:47] Some are weak and some are people.
[24:50] Others may not feel we're able but will
[24:54] not leave single one behind.
[24:59] Just a moment of background to that
[25:01] course. As most of you know, uh the Lord
[25:03] gave me that course some years ago and I
[25:06] was inspired by the scripture when
[25:09] Pharaoh said, "Leave your little ones."
[25:13] And Moses said, "We'll not leave our
[25:15] little ones and we'll not leave a hoof
[25:17] behind." And that's the way I believe
[25:20] that same spirit rests today
[25:24] &gt;&gt; uh in the believers. We're not going to
[25:26] leave a hoof behind. We're not leaving
[25:29] anything behind.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said that
[25:33] &gt;&gt; not one can be taken out of my hand.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Well, we got a young one here. It's just
[25:40] starting out on the way.
[25:42] And uh Brother Michael, Sister Abigail
[25:47] have brought their son to be dedicated.
[25:51] They've named him Silas Hudson.
[25:54] It's heavy duty.
[25:57] Silas is from the scripture. Of course,
[26:00] I don't know what inspired Hudson. I do
[26:02] know Hudson Taylor was a marvelous man
[26:06] of God established inland China mission
[26:09] in China. It is said of him that he
[26:12] would sooner ask God than ask man.
[26:17] But I have a scripture I'm going to uh
[26:20] read regarding
[26:23] uh regarding the dedication this
[26:25] morning.
[26:26] Silas also has an uncle named Silas. And
[26:30] I'm sure he's here this morning. And I'm
[26:33] certain that
[26:35] Abigail's
[26:38] father and mother had Silas from the
[26:41] scripture in mind when they named him.
[26:43] And I'm going to be making a few
[26:45] comments about that in a moment.
[26:48] The psalmist said, "My substance was not
[26:50] hid from thee when I was made in secret
[26:54] and curiously wrought in the lowest part
[26:56] of the earth. Thine eyes did see me or
[27:00] see my substance, yet being unperfect,
[27:04] and in thy book all my members were
[27:07] written, which in continuence were
[27:09] fashioned, when as yet there was none of
[27:12] them."
[27:13] Brother Brandham said, "Look at you. One
[27:15] time
[27:17] you were just a teeny germ.
[27:21] You look at it through the microscope
[27:23] glasses
[27:24] and look at the germ in the sperm, a
[27:26] human sperm, and there's just millions
[27:29] of them. Little tiny germs. So tiny that
[27:34] they can't see it with the natural eye.
[27:38] That was every individual here one time.
[27:42] And that was Silas.
[27:45] just a little cell. I will say that one
[27:48] time Silas was an unnamed
[27:51] cell.
[27:53] And I believe that as instructed
[27:56] believers, there's always a desire to
[27:59] name
[28:01] this unnamed cell when it comes into the
[28:05] world. And this child was called Silas.
[28:09] And uh to you Abigail, probably even
[28:13] more than Michael, you'll probably call
[28:15] his name thousands of times from here on
[28:18] out.
[28:20] And to call
[28:22] is to to call or to cry. And there'll be
[28:26] times you'll probably call his name and
[28:28] you'll be crying.
[28:31] And to call is to utter with a loud
[28:33] sound. And probably you'll do that,
[28:35] Michael, a few times.
[28:38] call for help
[28:40] or to invite or to be chosen. And I have
[28:43] a strange thought that I have never come
[28:46] to before in the dedication.
[28:52] One called Silas became well known
[28:54] because Paul and Barnabas
[28:58] came into a severe disagreement
[29:01] at one time. And it was so troubling
[29:06] that Paul and Barnabas separated from
[29:09] one another.
[29:11] And Barnabas took one of us called John
[29:15] Mark.
[29:17] And the dissension was so great that
[29:20] Barnabas wanted to take John Mark with
[29:22] them. And Paul said, "No, I don't think
[29:26] we should have him." And John and
[29:29] Barnabas said, "Well, I'm going to take
[29:31] him." and they parted ways. And the
[29:34] Bible says, "And Paul chose Silas
[29:40] and departed being recommended by the
[29:44] brethren."
[29:46] You never hear of John Mark again.
[29:50] And you only hear of Barnabas just uh
[29:53] he's mentioned three times in
[29:54] Corinthians as brother Apostle Paul
[29:58] speaks of him
[30:00] relating some things that took place.
[30:03] But Silas is mentioned Silas was with
[30:06] Paul in prison. Silas was with Paul when
[30:10] he established Corinth the church.
[30:13] Silas was with Paul
[30:16] because Paul chose Silas.
[30:20] And as I came to this dedication, I
[30:22] said, "Oh, God, choose Silas.
[30:25] And may this young man be invited to
[30:28] serve Christ may be dedicated to serve
[30:32] Christ. May the God of Apostle Paul, the
[30:36] God of his father and mother that are
[30:38] here, be his God." This is my prayer and
[30:43] that's my dedication service for Silas.
[30:48] Come here, Silas. You're already getting
[30:50] a voice and I think you want to be a
[30:53] preacher.
[30:55] Let us pray.
[30:58] Almighty God,
[31:01] father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
[31:04] called the Apostle Paul and Apostle Paul
[31:08] called Silas. And Father, that call was
[31:12] an invite. That call was a desire that
[31:16] you had. and a a a message that you had
[31:20] for him. Lord, I'm holding this son,
[31:24] this child. I'm praying, oh God, that
[31:26] you will bless him, that you'll keep him
[31:29] in health. You'll give him a good,
[31:31] strong body,
[31:33] &gt;&gt; and you'll use him for your glory. I
[31:36] dedicate him, Lord, Silas Hudson, in the
[31:39] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[31:43] Hallelujah. We want him to have energy.
[31:49] God bless you, Michael. God bless you,
[31:51] Abigail.
[31:53] Praise the Lord.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; I believe we have a a special, but just
[31:58] before we do,
[32:00] uh we have prayer for Sister Mened, and
[32:04] Brother Jake has sent us word that she
[32:07] has improved a lot, and we ask that you
[32:10] would continue to pray for her.
[32:13] And also, if you would please remember
[32:17] our dear saints in China, the
[32:20] authorities have indeed moved in
[32:23] and the first thing that they have
[32:26] confiscated is the women's skirts.
[32:30] Do you remember on Wednesday
[32:32] and I said I was going to bring it up
[32:34] this morning,
[32:36] I said that the manifested word
[32:39] is harder
[32:41] than the written word. Amen.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; They had the message books there, but
[32:46] they have not seized confiscated them.
[32:48] That'll be the next thing. They have
[32:50] said they will confiscate those. But the
[32:53] thing that they confiscated was what was
[32:55] being manifested. They confiscated the
[32:58] manifested word and now the written word
[33:01] and are sending investigators to another
[33:04] area where the message has reached and
[33:06] the message is stirring very very
[33:09] deeply. Those people are just like you.
[33:12] They'd love to be here.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; They'd love to have this freedom today.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; They'd love to be able to just go into a
[33:19] place and just worship and sing and hear
[33:22] the message preached. And uh I'm I'm
[33:26] very affected. I know a little bit of
[33:29] about that restraint. And there's others
[33:32] here from China and they know a whole
[33:35] lot more about it. But you know, when
[33:38] the spirit
[33:40] desires, it's like an eagle in that
[33:42] cage, wants to soar,
[33:46] wants to hear, wants to open the mouth,
[33:48] wants to praise, wants to worship. And
[33:51] I'll tell you friends, we're responsible
[33:53] for the liberty that we have. And may
[33:56] God at least grip our hearts to be in
[34:00] earnest prayer. the situation the words
[34:04] that I have that the situation right now
[34:08] is very critical and so let us let us
[34:12] not forget to uphold them in prayer.
[34:16] There's only limited things that we can
[34:18] say about it, but we want to let them
[34:22] know at least that we have taken this
[34:25] burden upon our hearts as though it is
[34:28] our own family, as though it's somebody
[34:30] who's sitting right beside us, our own
[34:33] members, part of our body, because
[34:35] indeed they are. So, if you remember
[34:38] them, please. God bless you, brother
[34:40] Jason.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got a group of sisters. if
[34:45] you'd come and and get ready at this
[34:47] time. Let's sing number 126.
[34:49] I want God's way to be my way as we
[34:53] journey here. Dear Lord,
[34:56] I want God's way to be my way as we
[35:02] journal.
[35:04] [Music]
[35:07] For there is no other highway
[35:12] that a child of God should go.
[35:16] Though the road steep can run,
[35:21] it leads me. It's enough.
[35:26] I want God's way to be my way every day.
[35:50] [Music]
[36:03] From the earthly me
[36:07] to the heavenly.
[36:11] From this body
[36:15] to our theophony
[36:19] oh from this old past house
[36:23] &gt;&gt; to our father's
[36:26] house.
[36:28] That's the mansion
[36:30] he's built for you and me.
[36:36] That's the mansion
[36:38] he's built for you and me.
[36:43] [Music]
[36:46] If our earthly house
[36:48] of this tabernacle be dissolved,
[36:52] we have another one waiting
[36:56] eternal in the heavens.
[37:02] He said, "I go
[37:04] to prepare a place for you
[37:09] that where I am, there you may be also.
[37:16] From the earthly
[37:20] to the heavenly,
[37:22] [Music]
[37:24] from his body
[37:27] to our theophony.
[37:31] Oh, from the soulcast
[37:34] to our father's house.
[37:40] That's the mansion he's built for you
[37:43] and me.
[37:47] That's the mansion he's built for you
[37:51] and me.
[37:56] In this body we grown,
[37:59] desiring to be clothed upon
[38:03] with our new body,
[38:06] celestial in the heavens.
[38:12] So when this corruption
[38:15] shall have put on incorruption,
[38:19] then mortality
[38:20] shall be swallowed up of life.
[38:26] From the earthly
[38:30] to the heavenly,
[38:34] from this body
[38:37] to our offering.
[38:41] Go from this old cast house to our
[38:46] father's house.
[38:49] That's the mansion he's built for you
[38:53] and me.
[38:57] That's the mansion he's built for you
[39:01] and me.
[39:03] [Music]
[39:06] Soon we'll lay aside
[39:09] this old ragged robe of flesh in
[39:12] exchange for a glorious one
[39:16] prepared in the heavens.
[39:19] [Music]
[39:22] And at the resurrection,
[39:24] at the sounding of the trump, my body
[39:28] will be glorified
[39:31] just like Jesus.
[39:35] Oh, from the earthly
[39:39] into the heavenly,
[39:43] from this body
[39:47] to our theophony.
[39:50] Oh, from the soest house to our father's
[39:57] house.
[39:59] That's the mansion he's built for you
[40:03] and me.
[40:07] That's the mansion he's built for you
[40:10] and me.
[40:12] [Music]
[40:14] From the earthly
[40:17] into the heavenly,
[40:22] from this body
[40:25] to our theophony.
[40:29] Oh, from the soul's house to our
[40:34] father's house.
[40:37] That's the mansion he's built for you
[40:41] and me.
[40:43] [Music]
[40:45] That's the mansion he's built for you
[40:49] and me.
[40:53] That's the mansion he's built for you
[40:57] and me.
[41:02] [Music]
[41:04] [Applause]
[41:14] Let's stand. I'd like to
[41:18] have you sing as a prayer as we come to
[41:20] the word. Open my eyes
[41:24] that I may see.
[41:30] And I trust you can sing these words
[41:34] just completely as a prayer. Open my
[41:38] eyes. Open my ears.
[41:41] Silently now we come.
[41:45] [Music]
[41:47] Open my eyes
[41:50] that I
[41:53] may see.
[41:55] Glimpses of truth
[42:00] has for me.
[42:04] Place in my hands
[42:07] the wonderful
[42:10] key
[42:12] that shall unlass
[42:16] and set
[42:18] me free.
[42:21] Silently
[42:22] bow
[42:24] I will for thee.
[42:29] Ready my heart.
[42:33] I will to see.
[42:37] Open my eyes.
[42:42] [Music]
[42:46] Spirit
[42:49] divine
[42:51] my eyes.
[42:53] Open
[42:55] my eyes.
[43:00] I need
[43:06] if I lift it up once again.
[43:10] So open
[43:13] my eyes
[43:15] if
[43:17] they
[43:20] spit
[43:21] [Music]
[43:24] divine.
[43:28] Oh blessed Lord Jesus.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; May the Holy Spirit be present amongst
[43:36] us this morning.
[43:38] Open our eyes.
[43:41] Open our ears.
[43:43] Illuminate us. Oh God.
[43:47] Move upon us by the Holy Spirit that
[43:50] gave such understanding.
[43:53] And you have said that he will teach you
[43:55] and lead you into all things.
[43:58] asking your
[44:00] blessed presence to be with us. Oh God,
[44:04] when you are here and you're present,
[44:07] the supernatural is happening.
[44:10] There are needs amongst us. I have
[44:14] needs, Lord. Raise my hands before you,
[44:18] asking that you provide now all that is
[44:21] necessary for this time as I stand at
[44:24] the post of duty. And those that shall
[44:28] hear and listen attentively, have come
[44:31] hungering, have come desiring, and for
[44:35] whatever purpose and reason they have
[44:37] come, I pray, oh God, you will
[44:40] captivate, take under your control every
[44:43] spirit
[44:45] and every thought for the glory of God,
[44:48] all that are streaming with us wherever
[44:50] they might be throughout the world.
[44:52] Lord, asking that you will bless them
[44:56] and make the service to be an
[44:58] inspiration,
[44:59] causing your people, Lord, to just take
[45:02] a step higher. Forgive us our wrongs.
[45:05] Forgive us our sins, oh God. Forgive us
[45:08] our failures. And I pray, Lord, we will
[45:11] be strengthened in the most holy faith.
[45:14] In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask your
[45:18] grace and blessings now. Amen.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:23] Nice to see everyone here. Mickey, Lily,
[45:26] God bless you, different ones.
[45:31] We're just happy to have you.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read from second
[45:37] Corinthians
[45:40] uh the 8th chapter.
[45:44] Just a short reading,
[45:47] one verse.
[45:54] verse 9.
[45:57] 2 Corinthians 8:9.
[46:01] For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus
[46:04] Christ,
[46:06] that though he was rich,
[46:09] yet for your sakes he became poor,
[46:14] that ye through his poverty
[46:18] might be made rich.
[46:23] Whatever we could estimate
[46:27] as being his riches,
[46:31] that is what it you are eligible for
[46:36] and to participate in his sufferings and
[46:38] his poverty as well. May God bless you
[46:42] as you have your seats.
[46:53] Okay,
[47:00] I would
[47:03] like to uh continue with uh part five
[47:10] of a holy
[47:12] resourcerich
[47:14] nation.
[47:16] And that is what
[47:19] God has intended that we would be.
[47:22] Don't want you to think that some things
[47:24] are repetitious.
[47:26] But sometimes when we are learning
[47:28] things in school, we certainly hear them
[47:30] more than once. And we hear them again
[47:34] and again and we hear them over and over
[47:36] until it becomes a part of us. until you
[47:39] have memorized it, until you can go home
[47:41] and quote it and say it off by heart.
[47:44] And that is very essential with some of
[47:46] these things. And I believe that what
[47:50] God has uh deposited within the bride
[47:54] body of Jesus Christ is something that
[47:58] Satan wants to do everything that he can
[48:01] to make sure that you don't discover
[48:05] everything that God has given. And so
[48:08] rather than just speak about it, I want
[48:10] to get right to the subject that though
[48:13] he was rich and rich is to in this case
[48:19] to have an abundance
[48:22] to be richly supplied
[48:25] to be affluent in resources
[48:28] and I am declaring on the authority of
[48:32] God's word that the church has the
[48:35] resources
[48:37] He's rich
[48:38] &gt;&gt; in repentance. She's rich in
[48:42] forgiveness. She's rich in humility.
[48:46] She's rich in revelation. She's rich in
[48:50] inspiration. She's rich in the word.
[48:53] She's rich in understanding. She's rich
[48:57] because she's been quickened. She's a
[48:59] rich body and powerful and strong. The
[49:04] prophet said, "You don't need power. You
[49:07] only need faith
[49:09] &gt;&gt; to move that power." We have the power
[49:14] and uh
[49:16] the body of Jesus Christ.
[49:20] There's a number of things that I just
[49:22] wanted to add at this point of things
[49:26] which the prophet said were in you. And
[49:29] if you can't believe me, believe him.
[49:33] believe what the word has said. He said,
[49:36] "If my kingdom," Jesus said, "if my
[49:39] kingdom is of this world." He said, "I
[49:42] could call many legions of angels, but
[49:45] my kingdom is not of this world, but my
[49:48] kingdom is in heaven." And he said, "The
[49:51] kingdom of God is within you."
[49:54] And so therefore
[49:56] the legions
[49:58] and and powers of the backing of the
[50:02] holy angels and brother Brandham
[50:05] couldn't stand it anymore. He just said
[50:06] hallelujah
[50:08] &gt;&gt; is in you
[50:13] &gt;&gt; was born into the deity of Christ by the
[50:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[50:19] These things are are are within the
[50:22] believer. He said the same power another
[50:24] in the deity of Christ. The same power
[50:26] of Christ that was hung on Calvar's
[50:30] cross. The same power of Christ that was
[50:34] hung on Calvar's cross. The same God
[50:38] that raised him up from the dead uh
[50:41] raised him up on the day of resurrection
[50:44] is in you now.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; You that's got the Holy Ghost. The same
[50:50] power that was in Christ while he hung
[50:52] on Calvary. And the same power that
[50:55] raised him from the dead is in every
[50:58] Holy Ghost believer now.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Not something you have to try to bring
[51:02] down.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; And Satan doesn't doesn't mind if you
[51:06] think it's up in heaven someplace or in
[51:09] some other stratosphere or he doesn't
[51:12] mind if you think that it's in your
[51:14] neighbor. He doesn't want you to get an
[51:17] understanding and a revelation that you
[51:20] possess it and it is within you
[51:24] &gt;&gt; because you might start developing it.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; You might start exploring. You might
[51:30] discover that this resource is within
[51:32] you. He doesn't want that discovery to
[51:34] take place.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; When Abraham walked over the land, it
[51:42] had all the oil that was under the
[51:44] ground. It had all the gold that was in
[51:46] the mountains. It had all the reserves
[51:48] to make the uh Israel as it is today a
[51:51] military force or powerful force or
[51:54] wealthy nation. It had all of that.
[51:56] Hadn't been discovered, hadn't been
[51:58] developed, hadn't been explored.
[52:01] And I can assure you that the nations
[52:04] around them don't want them to find that
[52:06] out. And Satan doesn't want you to find
[52:08] that out. And the prophet said, "And God
[52:11] had emptied himself into Christ and
[52:13] deity was in Christ." He said, "I hope
[52:16] you get it." And when that Christ was,
[52:19] he said, "And what that Christ was, he
[52:22] emptied into the Holy Ghost believer."
[52:25] He emptied. He didn't trickle it, but he
[52:28] emptied it into the Holy Ghost believer.
[52:31] So no matter what anybody says,
[52:35] he believes God's word.
[52:38] He has to for all that God was was in
[52:41] Christ and all that Christ is is in you.
[52:44] The believer the believer believes the
[52:47] word of God because the Holy Ghost can't
[52:49] doubt the very book that he authored.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; If ye are of God little children and
[52:57] have overcome them because greater is he
[53:00] that is in you than he that is in the
[53:02] world. Oh, how we hear that so many
[53:04] times it kind of just maybe runs off our
[53:06] back. I hope not this morning. He says,
[53:08] "If the word," this is in leadership.
[53:10] The very last message brother Brandham
[53:12] preached. If the word of God is in you
[53:17] from fore ordination of God in you, he
[53:21] said, "My sheep hear my voice. They know
[53:24] my holler.
[53:26] A stranger they won't follow." It's got
[53:29] to be that first. All that the Father
[53:34] has given me, they will come. Every one
[53:37] of them.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Every one of them.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; I don't care what state a person's in
[53:41] today. I said every one of them. That's
[53:43] what Jesus said. And that's my theme in
[53:46] these services. To confess is to say the
[53:48] same thing. I'm going to say the same
[53:50] thing he said. I don't care how many
[53:52] devils, how many people, how many
[53:54] anything don't believe it. I believe it.
[53:56] You believe it. The bride believes it.
[53:59] Everyone has to come. Whether you come
[54:02] through one knot hole, two or three or
[54:04] whatever, whether you come early or
[54:06] whether you come late, whether you come
[54:08] without being wounded or after you come
[54:10] wounded, whether you come without chains
[54:12] or you come with all kinds of bondages,
[54:14] you will come.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Whether you come with your doubts or
[54:17] whether you come with your troubles, you
[54:19] will come.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; If you're a son or a daughter of God,
[54:23] you will come because I'm simply
[54:26] repeating what he said.
[54:29] Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; In thinking man's filter, the only thing
[54:35] he said that you can draw through God's
[54:38] word, the only thing you can draw
[54:40] through God's word,
[54:43] the word is the spirit, the quickening
[54:45] power to make the word itself which is
[54:48] in you live to manifest Jesus Christ in
[54:53] the age that you're living. the only
[54:55] thing that you can draw through the word
[54:57] of God. You know, it's an amazing thing,
[54:59] but right here in the middle of the
[55:01] Bible, and I don't want to take any time
[55:02] with this, but when you if you take and
[55:05] divide your Bible between the Old and
[55:06] New Testament, which is this page right
[55:08] here, the only thing you can draw
[55:10] through here, because the New Testament
[55:12] immediately goes into Calvary and the
[55:14] sacrifice, the only thing that you can
[55:16] draw through there into the New
[55:18] Testament is the eulogy or the good
[55:21] record of those saints of the Old
[55:23] Testament. Because into the New
[55:24] Testament, you find nothing of Jacob's
[55:27] failures. You find nothing of him being
[55:29] a shyer. You find nothing of uh Abraham
[55:33] telling some white lies. If there is
[55:35] such a thing, you don't find any of
[55:37] their failures or their doubts or
[55:39] anything come through the cross because
[55:42] it can't come through the cross. It
[55:44] can't come through that filter.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; And the only thing you can draw through
[55:49] this filter is the manifested word for
[55:52] the hour. Amen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; It's going to manifest itself whether
[55:56] you do it or whatever happens, whether
[55:58] you do it early or do it late. Uh I
[56:00] guess a lot can be said about that. For
[56:03] now we see through a glass darkly.
[56:06] Apostle Paul said, "But then face to
[56:09] face." Now I know in part, but then
[56:13] shall I know even as I am known. Now we
[56:16] know in part because right now you're in
[56:19] the midst of, you know, your life. uh
[56:22] you're in the midst of circumstances.
[56:23] You're in the midst of uh raising a
[56:26] family, getting an education, or
[56:28] whatever more. You're in the midst of
[56:29] it. You're in the midst of your friends.
[56:31] You're in the midst of of a whole lot of
[56:34] events that are taking place that you
[56:36] know rotate and gravitate around you.
[56:39] But but uh and you can't see the end,
[56:42] but God knows the end from the
[56:44] beginning. So nothing's going to
[56:46] surprise him.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Nothing's going to surprise God. And be
[56:51] and if you could see the end, if you
[56:54] could really foretaste, if each one of
[56:56] us could just have a glimpse beyond the
[56:59] curtain of time, it would certainly
[57:02] change things for us today.
[57:05] It would change the whole uh viewpoint
[57:09] and perspective that you and I have, you
[57:13] would change your entire future if you
[57:16] could just have a little glimpse for a
[57:18] few seconds beyond the curtain of time.
[57:21] I'll tell you what that would do for
[57:22] you. It would make the things that are
[57:24] so important to you, it would they would
[57:27] just flatten out.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't be important.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; It would change your future. It would
[57:34] change your uh your whole agenda
[57:38] &gt;&gt; and I can assure you it would change
[57:40] your schedule tomorrow.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; If we could perceive things as God
[57:48] perceives them, if we could see what God
[57:51] has given us for this journey,
[57:55] we cannot possibly know it all. So from
[57:58] from this point forward, from this point
[58:00] backward, we have a memory for that. And
[58:03] sometimes that's doesn't really serve us
[58:05] too well. And from this point forward,
[58:08] we have to acknowledge it by faith what
[58:10] God has in mind for us. But as Apostle
[58:13] Paul said again in Philippians, being
[58:16] confident of this very thing, that he
[58:18] which hath begun uh a good work in you
[58:22] will perform it until the day of Christ,
[58:25] he will perform it.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; I'm really hung up on this to say the
[58:31] same thing.
[58:32] Amen.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; That is the confession. Say the same
[58:36] thing.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Not say what I feel or say what I see.
[58:41] Say what he said.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; In Thessalonians, faithful is he that
[58:48] calleth you, who also will do it.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; He will do it.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; I'm making my profession. You make your
[58:58] profession. He started a good work. He
[59:02] will do it.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; He will finish it. And that's how God
[59:06] works.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Now, one of the main works of the Holy
[59:12] Spirit is to bring back to your
[59:15] remembrance. I'm giving a a foundation.
[59:18] I want to move as quickly as I can.
[59:20] Jesus said, "But when the comforter, the
[59:22] Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in
[59:24] my name, he shall teach you all things."
[59:29] I was interested in this all things. All
[59:34] is the entire substance.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; All involves all time in all space. So
[59:42] there are there's an aspect there we've
[59:45] already run out of mental powers.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; All time in all space. I was talking to
[59:54] I got preaching a little bit to a couple
[59:55] brothers and uh and I was speaking with
[59:57] brother Derek and brother Gary came in
[59:59] for a message and if they happen to come
[1:00:01] in with a little message or something
[1:00:02] and I'm in the middle of of a a
[1:00:04] pre-ervice preaching in there if I get a
[1:00:06] hold of somebody I I I have to preach my
[1:00:09] message to them. Run into brother Tony
[1:00:11] and and sister Rebecca taking a walk
[1:00:14] down the White Rock and here we were
[1:00:15] with all those thousands of people. He
[1:00:17] actually interrupted me because I was in
[1:00:19] the middle of this message. I was
[1:00:20] preaching it to my wife. Remember when
[1:00:22] brother Brandham said he woke up early
[1:00:24] and his wife was sleeping or something?
[1:00:25] He said, you know, wake up, dear. I got
[1:00:27] to preach this message to you. So, I was
[1:00:29] in the middle of preaching the message
[1:00:31] while we walked took a walk in the
[1:00:32] afternoon and uh and I I get caught up
[1:00:36] with these things and I was I was uh I
[1:00:39] was uh I was saying to brother Derek and
[1:00:41] when you walked in, Brother Gary, uh I I
[1:00:44] said, you know, we can't we can't
[1:00:47] comprehend a God that has no beginning.
[1:00:51] said it Wednesday. You said, "Well, you
[1:00:52] said that Wednesday. I want to say it
[1:00:54] again.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; I can't comprehend it." I said, "And and
[1:00:58] and I said, this is probably one of the
[1:01:00] most profound things." I had it on this
[1:01:02] slide for you. You'll see it again this
[1:01:04] morning. And he says, uh uh I know we
[1:01:06] hear it so many times we run over it
[1:01:08] without thinking, but and a a a word is
[1:01:12] a thought.
[1:01:14] And he says, "And a thought has to be
[1:01:17] created." Think about that for a moment.
[1:01:20] and you were a thought
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; and but that thought had to be created.
[1:01:27] It's a profound statement and I want to
[1:01:29] unite it with another statement I think
[1:01:31] is equally profound and brother Brandham
[1:01:33] says in Christ the mystery of God
[1:01:35] revealed. He says God loved fatherhood.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; He loved fatherhood. So let's just let
[1:01:43] loose with your imagination for a
[1:01:46] moment. focus on your own person being
[1:01:49] here. I want to tie a few things
[1:01:51] together.
[1:01:53] God perhaps
[1:01:56] for hundred million years because he has
[1:01:59] no beginning. There is no he's timeless.
[1:02:03] That's right.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; But because he had this attribute
[1:02:06] loving, he loved fatherhood,
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; had this this great ambition, this
[1:02:14] yearning for fatherhood within him, this
[1:02:19] marvelous being maybe for aundred
[1:02:22] million years. He thought of a certain
[1:02:26] aspect of himself and he would like to
[1:02:30] just describe that and show it in a
[1:02:32] certain way and and in his mind that
[1:02:38] great mind of God
[1:02:43] and he not imagines but he thinks and
[1:02:48] constructs
[1:02:49] and creates
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; a thought. how it will be and how he
[1:02:55] will express that and how he will bring
[1:02:58] it into being, how he will allow right
[1:03:02] from Adam and he's got the seed going
[1:03:05] from generation to generation. He's he's
[1:03:08] going to bring something forth and part
[1:03:12] of that I hope you don't think I'm going
[1:03:14] off the deep end. Part of that he's got
[1:03:17] to it's going to be physical. So in a in
[1:03:20] a universe,
[1:03:22] he's creating
[1:03:24] uh entire galaxies
[1:03:28] and he's got a lakes formed in the
[1:03:33] heavens and burning suns and moons and
[1:03:38] planets and stars and putting them in
[1:03:41] their orbit. This God remember his he
[1:03:45] loves fatherhood. didn't say he loved
[1:03:47] stars or loved planets or loved meteors
[1:03:51] or anything else. He loves fatherhood.
[1:03:55] And when this clinker went off the sun
[1:03:58] and dropped for tens of millions of
[1:04:00] years and he stopped it by his power and
[1:04:03] it's just a a a smoking smoldering ember
[1:04:10] and a prophet of God who just gets up
[1:04:12] into some stratosphere of of mental
[1:04:16] powers says what's he making making you?
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You can get lost. You need to get
[1:04:24] lost in it. Think there there he was
[1:04:28] actually making the substance
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; that he would allow to come down cuz
[1:04:33] he's going to speak a seed. He's going
[1:04:36] to bring forth a son and he's going to
[1:04:39] create a womb for the son's seed so he
[1:04:43] can reflect himself. And then from
[1:04:45] generation to generation to generation
[1:04:47] on down on down will come this sea of
[1:04:50] humanity. But amongst it will be his
[1:04:54] children.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; And he loves fatherhood.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; He's going to reflect just a certain
[1:05:03] aspect of himself. And no one can
[1:05:07] describe or express that part but you as
[1:05:13] an individual.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; No one.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; And that's what you need to believe.
[1:05:18] Amen.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; That's what you need to believe. That's
[1:05:22] where it started. And that's why God has
[1:05:25] written and put such substance in the in
[1:05:30] some of the slides which we showed the
[1:05:33] last two services. And you need to put
[1:05:36] your personal self in there. I might
[1:05:38] just run through them very very quickly
[1:05:41] if we can
[1:05:43] have them up. That's why he said what he
[1:05:46] did that you are accepted
[1:05:49] in the beloved
[1:05:52] and what there is amongst
[1:05:55] the saints inheritance.
[1:06:09] Okay, I the blue part I want you to see
[1:06:11] and read and where it says us and we and
[1:06:16] so and so forth but I want you to say I
[1:06:19] and me
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; grace be unto me
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; and peace from God our father and Lord
[1:06:28] Jesus Christ he has chosen who me in him
[1:06:32] before the foundation of the world
[1:06:34] having predestinated me unto the
[1:06:37] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:06:40] unto himself.
[1:06:43] He hath made me accepted in the beloved.
[1:06:47] We have I have redemption through his
[1:06:50] blood. Say it again. I have redemption
[1:06:54] through his blood. I've been bought.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; I've already been purchased. It's been
[1:06:59] paid.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says Jesus did not give
[1:07:05] you an inheritance at Calvary. He simply
[1:07:08] paid the price. You had the inheritance
[1:07:10] before the foundation of the world.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Is this just some excitement? Is this
[1:07:15] just something for us humans to dance
[1:07:17] around, get happy about? No. These are
[1:07:20] vindicated prophets words.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; You had an inheritance
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[1:07:31] Calvary took place and the suffering of
[1:07:34] Christ simply to pay the price
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; and make it known to you.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; I have forgiveness of sins. He hath
[1:07:48] abounded unto me in all wisdom and
[1:07:51] prudence,
[1:07:55] having made known unto me the mystery of
[1:07:58] his will,
[1:08:00] in the dispensation of the fullness at
[1:08:02] times he might gather together in one
[1:08:05] all things in Christ, in whom also I
[1:08:09] have obtained an inheritance. That's why
[1:08:12] I want you to read it. being
[1:08:14] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:08:16] of him
[1:08:18] in whom also after that you believed I
[1:08:23] was sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise
[1:08:28] give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[1:08:30] revelation in the knowledge of him the
[1:08:33] eyes of my understanding
[1:08:35] being enlightened who's understanding oh
[1:08:39] is this just a Sunday morning service oh
[1:08:42] open our eyes, oh God, that we might see
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; glimpses of truth
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; you have for me.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Let me see. Don't let me walk out of
[1:08:54] here the same person I walked in. Don't
[1:08:57] let me just become enthused. Don't let
[1:08:59] me just have some uh emotional
[1:09:02] experience, but let this go down to the
[1:09:06] very souls of my feet.
[1:09:12] Hallelujah.
[1:09:15] That I may know what is the hope of his
[1:09:17] calling and what the riches of the glory
[1:09:19] of his inheritance in the saints. And
[1:09:22] you hath he quickened who were dead in
[1:09:25] trespasses and sins. Even when we were
[1:09:28] dead in sins, hath quickened me together
[1:09:30] with Christ. By grace am I saved.
[1:09:34] Amen.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; And hath raised who up?
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Me up has raised me up together and made
[1:09:42] us to sit together in heavenly places in
[1:09:44] Christ Jesus in the ages to come that he
[1:09:47] might show the exceeding riches of his
[1:09:49] grace. By grace are you saved.
[1:09:51] Incidentally, you're just having a look
[1:09:53] at your land.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "This is all
[1:09:57] Ephesians."
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; The prophet said this was Joshua, the
[1:10:01] book of Joshua in the New Testament.
[1:10:03] This is yours.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Leave it undeveloped if you wish, but
[1:10:09] that's up to you. You need to develop
[1:10:12] it.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to exercise it
[1:10:16] every
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; day.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; And those things that have defeated you,
[1:10:22] you need to say that come from the
[1:10:24] kingdom of darkness. That come from
[1:10:26] Satan. I identify it and I deny it and I
[1:10:30] reject it.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; And what are you going to do? I'm going
[1:10:32] to say the same thing the word says. I'm
[1:10:35] going to repeat what Jesus said. Until
[1:10:38] the devil understands that's what I
[1:10:40] believe.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; By grace are you saved and through faith
[1:10:48] it is the gift of God.
[1:10:51] For we are I am his workmanship
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; created in Christ unto good works. And
[1:10:59] God hath before ordained that we should
[1:11:02] walk in them. But now in Christ Jesus,
[1:11:06] ye sometimes who were a far off have
[1:11:08] been made nigh by the blood of Christ.
[1:11:14] We both have access by one spirit unto
[1:11:17] the Father.
[1:11:22] I am no more stranger and a foreigner,
[1:11:25] but fellow citizens with the saints and
[1:11:27] of the household of God. And I'm built
[1:11:30] upon the foundation of the apostles and
[1:11:32] the prophets, Jesus Christ himself being
[1:11:35] the chief cornerstone.
[1:11:37] In whom also I also am builded together
[1:11:41] for an habitation of God. In whom we
[1:11:44] have I have boldness and access. I
[1:11:48] wanted to highlight in a different color
[1:11:50] today for this exercise, but I haven't
[1:11:53] had the time to take those words which
[1:11:56] are the resources here. For example, I
[1:11:59] believe that boldness is a resource.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't come with timidity.
[1:12:06] We don't come with our hat in our hand.
[1:12:09] The scripture says we come boldly before
[1:12:12] the throne of grace.
[1:12:14] We have a father son, father daughter
[1:12:18] relationship.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; It's not somebody distant.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; We're fellow citizens.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; This nation
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; and we don't belong to any other nation.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; You may have your own personal passport.
[1:12:32] I'll tell you this is the passport to
[1:12:35] the kingdom of God. Amen.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; To be strengthened with might by his
[1:12:42] spirit in the inner man and to know the
[1:12:44] love of Christ which passes knowledge
[1:12:48] that you might be filled that I might be
[1:12:50] filled with all the fullness of God. You
[1:12:54] might say, "Well, I'm empty. I'm dry."
[1:12:56] This is the resource.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; This is the resource.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; I say to you, in the name of the Lord,
[1:13:01] you don't have to be empty. You don't
[1:13:03] have to be dry. You don't have to be
[1:13:05] defeated. You don't have to be weak.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be timid.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; I wish I could get the whole church to
[1:13:16] believe that.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Now, unto him that is able to do
[1:13:19] exceedingly abundantly above all that I
[1:13:22] ask or think. According to the power
[1:13:25] that workketh in me, unto him be glory
[1:13:29] in the church by Christ Jesus throughout
[1:13:31] all ages, world without end. Amen. Walk
[1:13:35] worthy of vocation wherewith you are
[1:13:37] called and in loneliness, in meekness,
[1:13:41] in longsuffering, in forebearing. Oh, we
[1:13:44] might say, well, I I don't have that.
[1:13:46] Yeah, you do have that.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Haven't developed it.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Need to develop the resource. I say the
[1:13:55] bride is rich.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Say he's rich.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; God has given these things.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; What am I going to say? Am I going to
[1:14:02] deny the word? I'm just reading your I'm
[1:14:05] just reading the
[1:14:08] the record of your resources
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; endeavoring to keep the unity. So I have
[1:14:14] such a hard time you know we have a
[1:14:16] personality clash. We have a
[1:14:19] personality. Well develop develop this
[1:14:21] one.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Unity is a resource
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; and it is a sustainable resource. Amen.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; You are not going to run out of this
[1:14:34] resource.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; God has given unity to his church.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; In the midst of in the midst of all the
[1:14:44] entanglements of the world, God has
[1:14:47] given unity.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; In the bond of peace.
[1:15:00] So what are we going to say? God has
[1:15:02] given us unity in the bond of
[1:15:05] compromise.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; God has given us unity in the bond of
[1:15:09] coexistence.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Don't get quiet now.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; You've been shouting up till now. You
[1:15:16] want to keep shouting.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; You want to keep confessing the same
[1:15:20] thing.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; The high priest can't move till you
[1:15:23] confess this.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; He is the high priest of your
[1:15:27] confession. You got to say the same
[1:15:30] thing.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; That's what it is in the Greek. Say the
[1:15:33] same thing.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:15:39] spirit in the bond of peace, God can
[1:15:42] still work mighty, mighty supernatural
[1:15:45] things amongst us.
[1:15:48] unto every one of us is given grace
[1:15:54] according to the gift of the of Christ,
[1:15:56] the measure of the gift of Christ. In
[1:15:58] whom the whole body fitly joined
[1:16:00] together and compacted by that which
[1:16:02] every joint supplieth according to the
[1:16:04] effect of working in the measure of
[1:16:06] every part. Every part maketh inter
[1:16:09] increase of the body under the edifying
[1:16:12] of itself in love.
[1:16:15] Put on the new man which after God has
[1:16:18] created in righteousness and in true
[1:16:19] holiness. Be ye kind to one another,
[1:16:22] tenderhearted, forgiving one another,
[1:16:24] even as God for Christ's sake hath
[1:16:27] forgiven you. My we want forgiveness but
[1:16:30] sometime we are hesitant to give
[1:16:33] forgiveness and both of those are very
[1:16:36] very important.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; We have to give forgiveness
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; and we also have to desire forgiveness.
[1:16:48] that we might present to himself a
[1:16:50] glorious church. All of this has been
[1:16:54] given to the body of Christ that he
[1:16:58] might have a glorious church, not having
[1:17:00] spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but
[1:17:02] that it should be holy and without
[1:17:04] blemish. For we are members of his body.
[1:17:08] I am member of his body. I am of his
[1:17:12] flesh. And I am of his pones. How can we
[1:17:16] say anything else?
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Are you free to say that?
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; I am a member.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; I am
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; of his body.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm a member of his flesh.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; I'm a part of his bones.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; I am inseparable
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; from Christ.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:41] Therefore, put on the whole armor of God
[1:17:43] that I may be able to stand against the
[1:17:45] ws of the devil.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:17:49] of God that you may be able to withstand
[1:17:51] in the evil day there will be one.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; And having done all to stand, stand
[1:17:57] therefore.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. and take the helmet of salvation,
[1:18:01] the sword of the spirit, which is the
[1:18:03] word of God, and above all, taking the
[1:18:05] shield of faith, wherewith you shall be
[1:18:07] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[1:18:08] the wicked. For those of you that
[1:18:10] weren't here on Wednesday, I just threw
[1:18:13] this up. Can you find Israel? In other
[1:18:15] words, can you find the promised land?
[1:18:17] And the prophet said the promised land
[1:18:18] was your land in the Holy Ghost. And
[1:18:22] quite often, it's very hard to find.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; You have to look hard. There's a lot
[1:18:27] around it. And it so happens, it just so
[1:18:31] happens as it is with Israel natural. So
[1:18:34] it is with us. All of this area here
[1:18:38] isn't very friendly.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; And they want to choke and drive that.
[1:18:43] You see that spot right there?
[1:18:46] Right from there, you can't even see it.
[1:18:49] From there over to the ocean. That's
[1:18:51] where Syria said not long ago, we'll
[1:18:56] just drive a pinser of tanks because
[1:18:58] it's only 11 miles to the Mediterranean
[1:19:02] and we'll cut Israel in two and they
[1:19:05] will be helpless.
[1:19:08] Their enemies thought they had focused
[1:19:12] on their weak point.
[1:19:15] Satan figures he's got you figured out.
[1:19:20] He thinks he's got your weak spot.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; And the thing that he has perpetrated as
[1:19:26] such a fraud upon the believers is that
[1:19:29] he's got them believing that the devil
[1:19:31] knows my weak spot. I'll have you know
[1:19:34] that Israel in the natural went in there
[1:19:36] and destroyed all of it
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; and even took some of the enemy's
[1:19:41] territory. I say to you in the name of
[1:19:44] Jesus Christ,
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; move in. Take your inheritance. Take all
[1:19:49] of your land. Defeat the enemy.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; They were even asked, "Why is it you
[1:19:58] attacked at night?" They said, "Because
[1:20:00] we found it in the Bible."
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; This is a nation. This is just a a a
[1:20:06] nation without Christ, without the Holy
[1:20:08] Ghost.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; But yet God, they're under the promise
[1:20:11] of God to do certain things. If a
[1:20:13] natural nation can do that, how much
[1:20:15] more you and I can do that?
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; I think you should look at the map.
[1:20:21] That's fine, brothers. If you'll just
[1:20:22] shut that off now.
[1:20:26] So, we've been looking at some of the
[1:20:29] resources that we have. And I just
[1:20:31] wanted to bring that by you again
[1:20:34] because while we are here, we have
[1:20:36] difficulty seeing all that we are. But
[1:20:40] I'm I'm I'm praying that you will
[1:20:42] develop it all or develop begin to
[1:20:46] develop.
[1:20:47] Peter said, "According as his divine
[1:20:49] power hath given us all things that
[1:20:52] pertain to life and godliness." Now
[1:20:58] uh
[1:20:59] you know it's hard
[1:21:01] and I wanted to talk about for a wee
[1:21:04] bit. It's hard to
[1:21:08] make a
[1:21:10] real scriptural profession because
[1:21:12] sometimes
[1:21:15] people misunderstand. They think, well,
[1:21:17] you think something of yourself more
[1:21:20] than
[1:21:22] uh than you should. And it's
[1:21:25] misunderstood
[1:21:26] when a person begins to say what he
[1:21:29] said.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Say what God said.
[1:21:34] Now,
[1:21:36] confession.
[1:21:38] The Bible says, and I've got to go over
[1:21:40] these very quickly, if thou shalt
[1:21:42] confess with thy mouth, if
[1:21:47] if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[1:21:51] Lord Jesus, and shall believe in thine
[1:21:55] heart that God has raised him from the
[1:21:57] dead. Now, we get the consequence. Thou
[1:21:59] shalt be saved. But if you don't confess
[1:22:02] with your mouth, it can't happen.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, I want to just pray it in
[1:22:08] my mind." If he wanted you to just to
[1:22:10] pray it in your mind, that's what he
[1:22:11] would have said. He would have said, "If
[1:22:13] you just pray it in your mind, if you
[1:22:15] just think about it, it'll happen. It
[1:22:18] won't happen if you just think about
[1:22:20] it." You got to confess with your mouth.
[1:22:23] You got to say, "I have sinned against
[1:22:25] God. I've sinned against my brethren. I
[1:22:29] have done wrong. I've lived back
[1:22:32] slitten. I've lived away from God. I've
[1:22:35] rejected the wooing of the Holy Spirit.
[1:22:38] Oh God, be merciful to me. And you said
[1:22:41] if I would confess with my mouth, I
[1:22:43] confess that Jesus paid it all. I
[1:22:46] confess that the blood has paid for my
[1:22:49] redemption.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; I confess that you will forgive me.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; And I confess I give my life to you.
[1:22:59] Hallelujah.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; And you begin to make that kind of
[1:23:02] profession.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; For with the heart man believeth unto
[1:23:07] righteousness, and with the mouth, with
[1:23:09] the mouth. Not with the mind. With the
[1:23:12] mouth. I find people in this age, they
[1:23:14] want to do everything with their mind.
[1:23:16] Not with your mind, with the mouth.
[1:23:18] Confession is made.
[1:23:23] So that people want to say kind then
[1:23:25] some little mumble and remember well if
[1:23:27] I if if I hurt you
[1:23:30] mumble that around
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; if you know you hurt somebody go and
[1:23:34] confess it
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; say it
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; I hurt you
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; I've come to ask you forgiveness
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; then God can work
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; people wonder why things don't get
[1:23:50] straightened around because you don't
[1:23:52] take it on the scriptural basis. You've
[1:23:54] got to take it on the scriptural basis
[1:23:57] otherwise nothing will work.
[1:24:09] heaven that they confessed that they
[1:24:10] were strangers and pilgrims on the
[1:24:12] earth. The Bible says further that if we
[1:24:15] confess our sins, he's faithful and just
[1:24:17] to forgive us. And hereby know we know
[1:24:21] ye the spirit of God. Every spirit that
[1:24:23] confessth that Jesus is Christ is come
[1:24:28] that he's come in the flesh is of God.
[1:24:30] And every spirit that confesseth not
[1:24:32] that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
[1:24:34] is not of God. Not has come in the
[1:24:37] flesh, is coming in the flesh.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; All kinds of people want to believe he
[1:24:42] had did come.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; No, we're talking about now.
[1:24:46] True.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is
[1:24:49] the son of God, God dwelleth in him, and
[1:24:51] he is in he is in God. And then this
[1:24:55] last one, holy brethren,
[1:24:58] partakers of the heavenly calling,
[1:25:00] consider the apostle
[1:25:03] and high priest of our profession, Jesus
[1:25:06] Christ. And to confess, to confess and
[1:25:10] to profess, it's almost almost identical
[1:25:13] word. In fact, they have the same root
[1:25:15] word in in the Greek. In confession is
[1:25:19] to say the same thing as another and to
[1:25:23] agree with I agree.
[1:25:27] We agree. And furthermore, confession
[1:25:30] comes down the root same root word for
[1:25:33] confession and profession in the Greek
[1:25:35] is very very interesting because it's a
[1:25:37] word I think you all know. It is logos.
[1:25:41] So confession logos is a a living word.
[1:25:46] Logos is not a thought.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Logos is not a reasoning. So we don't
[1:25:51] obtain we don't uh uh we don't develop
[1:25:56] our resources by mental powers.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; We develop our resources by speaking
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; a word.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; When you speak the word
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; and you make the confession. That is why
[1:26:10] the weakest may maybe most uh you know
[1:26:15] one that's not visible or one that's not
[1:26:19] you know to the forefront within a
[1:26:22] congregation they can be such a powerful
[1:26:25] member of the body of Christ because
[1:26:27] they keep saying the same thing and
[1:26:31] that's why pro the prophet said say what
[1:26:33] the tape says because he knew that had
[1:26:36] come from a vindicated voice Say what it
[1:26:40] says.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Don't say what you think it says.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Say what it says.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "It seems like,"
[1:26:55] and this is in the message of lamb and
[1:26:57] the dove. My I'm trying to go as quickly
[1:26:59] as I can here. I hope you forgive me. It
[1:27:02] seems like it's the hardest thing for
[1:27:04] people to get in their head that the
[1:27:08] Holy Spirit leads. Sons and daughters of
[1:27:12] God are led by the spirit of God and not
[1:27:17] bishops and cardinals and so forth, but
[1:27:22] the spirit of God. That's that was God's
[1:27:27] idea. And this is what confession.
[1:27:31] This is what confession is. This it came
[1:27:34] from that base word which I gave you the
[1:27:37] logos which is word. This is what is so
[1:27:40] interesting. It is God's idea.
[1:27:44] That was God's idea. And you know
[1:27:47] brother Brandham used that phrase many
[1:27:50] times. And I just want to give you a few
[1:27:53] because he said the the sons and
[1:27:56] daughters of God are led by the spirit
[1:27:58] of God. And I'll just abbreviate because
[1:28:00] he said not bishops and not cardinals,
[1:28:02] not this, not that. By the spirit of
[1:28:04] God, he said that was God's idea.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; That was his thought.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; And his thought then became a word. And
[1:28:13] that's why he said it. Now he's waiting
[1:28:16] for us to make that confession. not to
[1:28:19] say just sons and daughters, you know,
[1:28:21] on a great big broad grand scale or led
[1:28:24] by the spirit of God. He wants it to be
[1:28:28] a personal.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; He he spent a few hundreds of millions
[1:28:32] of years even crafting the thought in
[1:28:35] his mind and and and creating the
[1:28:37] thought that would bring you into
[1:28:39] existence.
[1:28:41] Doesn't he deserve us to be able now
[1:28:43] that he gave us a mouth, gave us a
[1:28:45] breath, gave us a tongue, gave us a
[1:28:48] language, gave us a a capacity to love
[1:28:51] him. Isn't it Isn't he do us to say the
[1:28:54] same thing?
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Not just say sons and daughters are led
[1:28:59] by the spirit of God, but to say I am
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; a son. I am a daughter. And I am led by
[1:29:06] the spirit of God.
[1:29:10] doesn't do God any good. It doesn't do
[1:29:12] God any good. Person say, "Well, I know.
[1:29:14] I guess the devil got a whole I don't
[1:29:15] know. The devil this and the devil
[1:29:17] that." What are we doing?
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; You think he thought of you for a few
[1:29:21] hundreds of millions of years to bring
[1:29:22] you on the scene to blubber out of your
[1:29:24] mouth? Oh, yes. The devil got a hold of
[1:29:26] me.
[1:29:30] I say,
[1:29:32] "This son has to go through a few more
[1:29:34] knocks.
[1:29:35] He got to find out
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; that he's got to start saying what I
[1:29:39] said.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; And then I come out and I confirm it and
[1:29:44] I speak it and I give it so plain, so
[1:29:47] clear and so and and and the prophet
[1:29:49] says it can't get it through their head.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Can't get it through this
[1:29:55] skull him.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Oh God, illuminate us.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Speak to us.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:04] That
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; was God's idea
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; in conference with God. He said, "No
[1:30:09] wonder St. Paul could say years after
[1:30:12] that when the bee of death uh the bee of
[1:30:16] death was hunting around him, say, "Oh,
[1:30:19] death, where is thy vic? Where's your
[1:30:22] stinger? Grave, where's your victory?"
[1:30:26] But thanks be to God who giveth us
[1:30:28] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:30:30] Death was conquered and the bee could
[1:30:32] hum around. The bee of death could buzz
[1:30:35] and say, "I got you." But you can point
[1:30:39] over yonder to an empty grave and he
[1:30:43] didn't say and think. You can point over
[1:30:45] to an empty grave and say,
[1:30:50] "Thanks be to God that gives us the
[1:30:53] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; The grave's empty."
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; What are you doing? Saying the same
[1:31:01] thing, saying the same thing, but you
[1:31:04] feel sick. Say the same thing that he
[1:31:07] said.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; You feel defeated. You made a mistake.
[1:31:10] You fell. You sinned. Whatever more he
[1:31:13] if I confess with my mouth the Lord
[1:31:15] Jesus he is he's faithful to deliver me.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't like this kind of
[1:31:23] preaching. He doesn't like you to come
[1:31:25] and love it and say amen to it. But I
[1:31:27] tell you what, you agree with it.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Every one of you, you agree with it. And
[1:31:32] God will move on this scene on your
[1:31:34] behalf.
[1:31:36] You can put him to the test. He cannot
[1:31:38] lie. He's not a man. He will say the
[1:31:41] same thing.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Thanks, God. Thanks be to
[1:31:47] God that gives us the victory." He said,
[1:31:49] "He can make a noise, but he can't sting
[1:31:53] you.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; He ain't got any more stinger."
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; When he anchored his stinger into the
[1:32:00] flesh of Emmanuel, God's flesh among us,
[1:32:03] it pulled the stinger out. And he said,
[1:32:06] "Out of death." He pulled the stinger
[1:32:08] out of death. And he closes with this
[1:32:10] phrase. That was God's idea at his first
[1:32:13] conference.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; I'm glad we're not here with some man's
[1:32:20] idea
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; or some bishop's idea or some
[1:32:24] headquarters idea. We have God's idea
[1:32:27] that came down from the beginning and
[1:32:30] was demonstrated and manifested in this
[1:32:32] hour. And a prophet's mouth could open
[1:32:35] up and say, "Say it."
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; That was God's idea.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; And knoweth it not, he said, "We'll
[1:32:47] never do any good with politics.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; It's rotten."
[1:32:54] 1998
[1:32:56] the prime minister Chiron of Israel he
[1:32:59] said to the people build outposts on
[1:33:03] every hill
[1:33:05] occupy every hill every mountain build
[1:33:09] an outpost
[1:33:11] just a few years later he's saying get
[1:33:14] out of there
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; and if you don't get out we'll send the
[1:33:18] army in and we're sending the bulldozers
[1:33:20] in. We're on the Oh, we're on the
[1:33:23] roadway, the map to peace
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; invented by the president of the United
[1:33:29] States.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; We don't have
[1:33:34] that kind of idea.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; We have the idea. I don't care what
[1:33:38] president
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; or what prime minister or what nation.
[1:33:43] This is the thought of God.
[1:33:45] And it was God's idea. God's idea was
[1:33:49] said to Abraham, "I've given you all
[1:33:52] this land." I don't care what anybody
[1:33:54] says. That's what every Jew ought to be
[1:33:56] saying today. What God said is what I'm
[1:33:58] going to repeat. Even in the face of the
[1:34:01] bulldozers, I say God gave our father
[1:34:04] all the land from this boundary to that
[1:34:06] river to the sea.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:12] Amen.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Forgive me for getting excited, but I
[1:34:16] tell you what, that burns up in my
[1:34:18] bosom.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; And let it go far and wide. It'll go far
[1:34:24] beyond the walls of this sanctuary.
[1:34:26] It'll go on the internet. It is already
[1:34:29] going on it. And it'll go from your
[1:34:31] mouth.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; It'll go across the seas. It'll have an
[1:34:35] effect. It'll have an influence.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; That was God's idea. Amen.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; God's idea of having a king, he said
[1:34:44] it'll never do any good through
[1:34:46] politics. It's rotten. God's idea of
[1:34:49] having a king, a righteous king, is
[1:34:52] right.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; That was God's idea.
[1:34:57] Hallelujah.
[1:35:03] We see things and you know what? It's
[1:35:05] difficult not to become
[1:35:08] not to become negative.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; I better not get on that or I won't
[1:35:14] won't get any further. I'd like to spend
[1:35:16] another few minutes on the message. I
[1:35:19] said I would start on choosing the
[1:35:22] harder way and I'm there now.
[1:35:26] We do have within us the power
[1:35:30] to choose the harder way.
[1:35:35] Doing the right thing, living the right
[1:35:38] life
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; is not the easy way. I'm calling on you
[1:35:43] as individual believers to choose the
[1:35:46] harder way. You might say, well, what
[1:35:48] does that mean? Well, we'll talk about
[1:35:50] it for a little bit.
[1:35:53] And the message marriage and divorce was
[1:35:55] when you know there was a prophecy over
[1:35:58] brother Brandham in tongues
[1:36:02] at the cafeteria in Los Angeles
[1:36:05] and three people stood up and
[1:36:06] interpreted
[1:36:08] and one
[1:36:11] uh which was Danny Henry. He was an
[1:36:14] official interpreter from the French
[1:36:16] language
[1:36:17] and another woman came up. All three of
[1:36:21] the interpreters interpreted exactly the
[1:36:23] same thing. And brother brother Brandham
[1:36:26] is actually reading Danny Henry's signed
[1:36:29] note in marriage and divorce. And it
[1:36:33] starts out, the prophecy starts out and
[1:36:36] brother Brandham as you know is towards
[1:36:38] the end of his ministry
[1:36:40] said in marriage and divorce 1965 said
[1:36:43] because because thou hast chosen the
[1:36:48] narrow path the harder way.
[1:36:53] That's the opening phrase.
[1:36:56] You know the opening phrase is very
[1:36:58] important.
[1:36:59] And when you would stand before him and
[1:37:03] he would say to you, "Because
[1:37:06] you've chosen a harder way, the saints
[1:37:08] in China right at this moment know that
[1:37:12] this is the harder way."
[1:37:15] My wife, I told her for the first time
[1:37:17] just driving up here to the church, I
[1:37:21] got this note. I got this message out of
[1:37:24] China about two days ago and it's been a
[1:37:27] heavy weight on me. But she as a woman
[1:37:30] said this is such a violation
[1:37:34] that they would take that the
[1:37:36] authorities would tell a woman what she
[1:37:39] can wear and the very garment that she
[1:37:42] desires to wear is stripped from her and
[1:37:46] taken from her. That's why a prophet
[1:37:48] says it's rotten
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; to the core. It's rotten in China. It's
[1:37:53] rotten in America. It's rotten in
[1:37:55] Canada.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; We have just suffered the loss of four
[1:38:01] Royal Canadianmounted police, gunned
[1:38:04] down in cold blood by a young man or a
[1:38:08] man who was brought up in a Christian
[1:38:11] home and his father said he is a devil.
[1:38:16] He started with marijuana. Started. His
[1:38:19] father said he started years ago with
[1:38:21] marijuana and we have a government that
[1:38:24] stand up and give words of compassion,
[1:38:30] have a moment silence and send
[1:38:32] dignitaries and speak nice things and at
[1:38:37] the same time are passing legislation to
[1:38:40] legalize marijuana.
[1:38:44] Whoever whoever whoever gives a scent to
[1:38:48] that bill takes responsibility for those
[1:38:51] boys death.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; That's a that's the just the bare naked
[1:38:57] truth.
[1:38:59] If you only had what a prophet said,
[1:39:03] a judge in Atlanta
[1:39:06] slam
[1:39:07] his his court reporter killed the deputy
[1:39:12] has died and the fourth one is in still
[1:39:15] in the hospital the last I heard and I
[1:39:19] don't know the condition but he got his
[1:39:21] gun from a woman officer
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; in the elevator and if they had a
[1:39:28] prophet. If they'd listened to their
[1:39:29] prophet, she'd have been home baking
[1:39:31] cookies.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; She'd have been home maybe looking after
[1:39:34] the children. She has children. She'd
[1:39:36] have been home caring for her husband or
[1:39:38] her home or whatever more. She'd have
[1:39:39] been where she should be instead of
[1:39:41] being where she should not be and have a
[1:39:43] man overpower her because she's not. He
[1:39:46] felt sorry. He said it's the most dis
[1:39:48] it's a disgraceful thing for a nation
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; to put a woman out in front of that
[1:39:53] trouble. Amen.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; It's a sick sick generation we're in
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; and we're not being negative. That's the
[1:40:03] way things are going. And my brother, my
[1:40:06] sister, there's violence in every place.
[1:40:08] Seven people swaying yesterday in a
[1:40:10] church service
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; in church
[1:40:16] trying to worship God and someone comes
[1:40:18] in that's disgruntled with the minister
[1:40:22] and takes their lives.
[1:40:25] Oh, this word says
[1:40:29] as it was in the days of Noah
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; and the earth was filled with violence.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Filled with violence everywhere. You can
[1:40:38] take this world, but I'll have the next
[1:40:39] one.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; You can keep this. This is degenerating.
[1:40:44] You think it's going to improve? It's
[1:40:46] degenerating to a tribulation.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; And we might as well say what he says.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; That's what he says. Amen.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Anyone who would even go into the
[1:40:58] tribulation with a trickle of God's
[1:41:02] uh call in their life said, "Well, they
[1:41:05] will pay with their life."
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Why would we why would we sit in an
[1:41:11] atmosphere like this
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; and allow it to the opportunity to slide
[1:41:16] by? I say to every believer, we want to
[1:41:18] snug up.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; We want to do what he said to do. You
[1:41:22] want to believe in the resources that
[1:41:24] God has given you and don't let them sit
[1:41:27] idle.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; I thought of the man with the talents.
[1:41:30] And the one hid it in the ground. The
[1:41:32] other that was given five. And the other
[1:41:34] that was given two. They went and gained
[1:41:37] another two and another five. And the
[1:41:40] one said, "Oh, here I hid it in the
[1:41:42] ground. I didn't develop it. I didn't do
[1:41:44] anything with it. I didn't I didn't even
[1:41:46] he said at least you could have put it
[1:41:48] out to the to the lenders and we could
[1:41:50] have had the interest from the usery of
[1:41:52] it. You didn't do anything with it. God
[1:41:54] expects when he gives us something and
[1:41:57] when I have read and you have read and I
[1:42:00] have put myself personally in the book
[1:42:02] of Ephesians and a prophet declares that
[1:42:05] is your land.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with that land?
[1:42:09] Don't bury it. Don't leave it there and
[1:42:11] just say well yeah I I believe it you
[1:42:12] know we do have it. I do have the power
[1:42:14] of forgiveness. I have the power of
[1:42:15] unity. I have the power all of these
[1:42:16] things. God expects you to do something
[1:42:18] with it.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Develop it.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Show yourself rich
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; in Christ.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I feel like I feel like
[1:42:30] preaching, friends, feel like preaching
[1:42:31] to the world.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Those attending here today, don't just
[1:42:37] take this as another Sunday morning
[1:42:39] service.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; You might not get out for a long time
[1:42:42] the way I feel right now. Don't look at
[1:42:44] your watch cuz your watch will do you no
[1:42:46] good.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; If you're going to do anything, you
[1:42:49] better pray.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Stop that, man.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; It's the only thing that might stop it.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; It's It's hard to say the truth.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit spoke through these
[1:43:06] people in tongues. Said, "You've chosen
[1:43:09] the narrow path." Was it ever narrow?
[1:43:13] lost most of all of his friends in the
[1:43:15] seals. He says, "I know that this will
[1:43:17] cost me 10,000 of my friends."
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; He's going to say it anyway.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Lost his friends. You know why? Because
[1:43:32] he had to say the truth.
[1:43:37] Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but
[1:43:40] the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.
[1:43:48] Am I therefore the Apostle Paul? The
[1:43:50] Apostle Paul.
[1:43:54] You might say, "Oh, if the Apostle Paul
[1:43:56] was here, if we had anything but brother
[1:43:58] Biscll, if the Apostle Paul was here, I
[1:44:01] tell you what, you wouldn't accept it
[1:44:03] any different if Brother Brandham was
[1:44:05] here himself or if the Apostle Paul was
[1:44:07] here or the Lord Jesus Christ was here."
[1:44:09] Cuz you got to fight the same devil,
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; the same doubt,
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; and you know what they would do? They'd
[1:44:15] say the same thing
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; because they can't say anything
[1:44:18] different than what is already written
[1:44:20] here.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; They'd say the same thing.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; I therefore, Apostle Paul says, am I
[1:44:29] therefore become your enemy? Because I
[1:44:32] tell you the truth.
[1:44:36] Paul said that.
[1:44:38] Do you know why? Because some had become
[1:44:41] his enemy.
[1:44:45] I want you to hear real close. Some
[1:44:48] folks think, "Oh, if you just if you're
[1:44:51] really preaching it, people just flock
[1:44:54] to hear you." Don't you believe it?
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; If you speak the truth, some will flock
[1:44:58] to hear it. But most will flock away
[1:45:01] from it.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; They don't want to hear the truth.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; They don't want to hear how they're
[1:45:06] supposed to live and how they're
[1:45:07] supposed to act and how they're supposed
[1:45:08] to dress, how they're supposed to sing
[1:45:10] and how they're supposed to preach. They
[1:45:11] don't want to hear that.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; I say, "We want to hear the truth."
[1:45:17] And I trust that everyone who comes here
[1:45:18] wants to hear the truth.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; And if it hurts, don't shove it off.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Don't pass it to someone else. Say,
[1:45:25] "Amen." That's me, oh Lord.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Let it take the hide off my back.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Don't let me get through here easy. Let
[1:45:32] me hear the truth.
[1:45:40] He said, "Tell the truth no matter how
[1:45:43] bad it hurts something. Tell the truth
[1:45:46] anyhow cuz you can always tell it the
[1:45:49] same way each time." That's what Brother
[1:45:51] Brandham told Billy Paul. He says, "And
[1:45:53] if you tell a lie, you have to go a
[1:45:56] million miles around and still you have
[1:45:59] to come back to that lie again. And you
[1:46:02] just made an awful thing." and just be
[1:46:04] honest and you can always tell it the
[1:46:07] same way because it's the truth.
[1:46:10] It was a hard time. Can I go on for a
[1:46:14] few more minutes?
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Just a few days into the wilderness
[1:46:18] journey and the children of Israel got
[1:46:22] to Kadesh Barnea.
[1:46:24] And I'm interested to see how
[1:46:28] people in the same company,
[1:46:33] now I'm getting really touchy spot here,
[1:46:36] how the people in the same church, cuz
[1:46:38] once they got called out, they were the
[1:46:40] church.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; You understand? They were the church.
[1:46:46] And the people in the same church
[1:46:50] were experiencing the same thing and had
[1:46:53] completely opposing views of the event.
[1:46:58] God said to Moses, "Send out the spies.
[1:47:01] Get these honorable men, princes,
[1:47:03] leaders amongst the people and send them
[1:47:05] out. Send 12 spies out. Two come back."
[1:47:09] Well, they all come back and they say,
[1:47:11] "Oh, it is a land indeed. It flows with
[1:47:14] milk and honey." The resources are
[1:47:16] there, but we can't get to it.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; We can't develop them.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; They're just far too big obstacles
[1:47:29] in the land. I can never I can never do
[1:47:31] that. They said they begin to contrive
[1:47:35] amongst themselves, let's vote in a
[1:47:38] leader that'll take us back to Egypt. be
[1:47:42] a lot better to die in Egypt than it
[1:47:45] would be to go in there. We either want
[1:47:47] to die in Egypt or die in this
[1:47:49] wilderness.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Can you believe that?
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; I say it was mass insanity took a hold
[1:47:54] of the people.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Mass insanity took a hold of the people.
[1:47:58] Why not die at least going into your
[1:48:00] inheritance? Amen.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; You know this man that just shot the
[1:48:06] judge in Atlanta,
[1:48:08] he went to take a reporter's car and I
[1:48:12] saw the reporter on a video clip on my
[1:48:15] my computer and he gave his testimony
[1:48:19] and he's all bruised over his eye and on
[1:48:22] his nose. Looked like his nose almost
[1:48:24] was broken. He said he just come from
[1:48:26] the hospital. They're interviewing him.
[1:48:28] He looked very much like brother Lonnie
[1:48:30] Jenkins actually in appearance
[1:48:32] and he's very clear with his thoughts.
[1:48:34] They were searching for a a green 1997
[1:48:38] Honda. It was his Honda.
[1:48:40] And this fellow came up to him with his
[1:48:42] gun. Says, "Give me your keys."
[1:48:45] He said, "No, I'm not going to give you
[1:48:47] my keys." He said, "You give me your
[1:48:49] keys or I'm going to kill you."
[1:48:51] So he gave him his keys, got out, and
[1:48:55] the guy opened up the trunk, says, "Get
[1:48:57] in that trunk."
[1:48:59] He said, "I'm not going to get in that
[1:49:01] trunk." He said, "You get in that trunk,
[1:49:03] I'm going to kill you."
[1:49:05] And he knew in his own mind that if he
[1:49:08] got in the trunk, he'd be killed. So he
[1:49:12] decided and the guy struck him with a
[1:49:14] gun and and the gashed his eye and his
[1:49:18] nose and everything and he fell and
[1:49:19] broke his wrist. But he decided I'd
[1:49:23] sooner die running,
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; getting free than die in that trunk. I
[1:49:29] know if I get in that trunk, I'm dead
[1:49:31] man. So I'm going to run for it. And he
[1:49:34] ran. And the guy didn't shoot. He got in
[1:49:36] the car and took off. I tell you what,
[1:49:39] these children of Israel, do you know
[1:49:42] what? They died in the wilderness
[1:49:45] because that's what they said.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; What they said is what they got.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; I'm going to just hold this thing. I'm
[1:49:54] going to just keep this chip. I'm going
[1:49:56] to just feel this way. I'm just going to
[1:49:58] have that. You'll die there.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; You'll die holding that thing.
[1:50:03] Hallelujah.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; You need to develop the resource.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; I have the capacity to forgive.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; And you know, we kind of make light of
[1:50:16] it. We make light of it at the very
[1:50:17] words of Jesus. You know why we make
[1:50:19] light of it? Where Jesus said 70* 7 when
[1:50:22] Apostle Peter thought, "Oh, I'm really
[1:50:25] saying something. Do I have to forgive
[1:50:27] this man if he comes seven times in a
[1:50:30] day?"
[1:50:32] And then we say lightly. You know why we
[1:50:34] say it lightly? Because we haven't
[1:50:35] developed the resource. We want to make
[1:50:37] it light. It's not light. Jesus said 70*
[1:50:41] 7.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; And because you haven't got enough hours
[1:50:44] in the day to say it 70* 7, what he's
[1:50:47] saying is this is something that you
[1:50:49] have. It's part of my nature. It's part
[1:50:51] of my character.
[1:50:57] Oh my brother, my sister, if we could
[1:50:59] see the kind of homes and the kind of
[1:51:01] families, if we'd only live by the word
[1:51:03] of God. As I said, young people say,
[1:51:05] "It's obey your parents. Obey and honor
[1:51:08] your parents."
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; How can I do that? My dad's so
[1:51:12] unreasonable. My mother's so
[1:51:14] unreasonable. Mother Mother screams at
[1:51:15] me. This happens. That happened. That
[1:51:16] isn't what it says. That's right.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; And the word is saying for you to say
[1:51:21] the same thing.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; And you have the capacity. You have the
[1:51:26] power within you.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; You know, my daddy's gone.
[1:51:35] A lot of years ago, my sister Anne is
[1:51:37] here. It's at his bedside when he left.
[1:51:42] And my daddy and I worked at the same
[1:51:44] worked in the same place.
[1:51:47] and I was his boss eventually. I was
[1:51:51] president and he was he was probably the
[1:51:53] bottom man on the ladder.
[1:51:57] Nobody ever knew that. I had people
[1:51:59] really come up and say they called him
[1:52:00] Freddy and called me Eddie. They said we
[1:52:03] wish we had that kind of relationship
[1:52:06] you have. I had other people strangers
[1:52:09] come up say are you brothers? No. I said
[1:52:11] this is my father.
[1:52:15] I was president. He was bottom man. But
[1:52:18] in my mind, he was top man.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; He was my father.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; And when my father said something, we
[1:52:25] might even disagree. We might disagree
[1:52:28] on something that never changed one
[1:52:32] biota of our relationship. It was a
[1:52:35] marvelous, marvelous relationship. And I
[1:52:38] tell you what, it doesn't it doesn't
[1:52:41] happen without some something being
[1:52:43] developed.
[1:52:45] This doesn't just come on a silver
[1:52:47] platter. It's something you have to say
[1:52:49] in your heart. I'm going to develop
[1:52:51] this. This is my father. This is my
[1:52:53] mother. You young people. This is my
[1:52:55] father and this is my mother. And by you
[1:52:58] by you you honoring the word of God and
[1:53:00] honoring them, it'll make even a big
[1:53:02] transformation.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Can I just take five minutes?
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Five minutes more.
[1:53:14] So we got we got Israel at Kadesh Barnea
[1:53:17] and we'll leave we'll leave that there.
[1:53:26] It's harder to declare
[1:53:31] the manifested word than it is to
[1:53:34] declare the written word.
[1:53:38] Because you know we can say, "Oh, this
[1:53:40] is what the word of God says. Here's a
[1:53:42] message book. This is what the message
[1:53:43] says. This is what happened. Now, I I
[1:53:46] can show you. I'll tell you something.
[1:53:48] Malachi 4 was written here for hundreds
[1:53:51] and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[1:53:53] and hundreds of years.
[1:53:55] It never was a problem. I never heard
[1:53:58] that Malachi 4 was anything to dispute
[1:54:00] about till Malachi 4 came.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; When Malachi 4 came and a ministry just
[1:54:06] fitted, Brother Brandham, you can't find
[1:54:08] a place. You can't find one place. I
[1:54:10] challenge you. Where he says, I'm
[1:54:12] Malachi 4.
[1:54:14] He never said that, but he kept saying
[1:54:16] is what Malachi 4. Behold, when Elijah
[1:54:19] comes, he'll forun. He'll turn the
[1:54:21] hearts of the children back to the
[1:54:23] fathers. And when they begin to see and
[1:54:25] the people begin to see manifested
[1:54:28] Malachi 4, they didn't mind it written,
[1:54:30] but we don't want to see it manifested.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; We don't want to see it manifested. See,
[1:54:35] they'll say in here that a long hair on
[1:54:37] a woman is her glory, but they don't
[1:54:39] want to see it.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; We don't want to see it when they see it
[1:54:43] go by.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; What in the world is this? Some strange
[1:54:49] creature from space.
[1:54:52] No. No. You just saw something walk by
[1:54:55] that had their glory.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; And the world's not accustomed to that
[1:54:59] glory.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; That's a strange sight to them, that
[1:55:02] kind of glory. and they meet people with
[1:55:04] clean mouths
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; and they see men with a radiance on
[1:55:08] their face and women's with a glory on
[1:55:10] their face and it's a strange thing in
[1:55:12] this world.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; I had a total total sinner said to me,
[1:55:17] "Are you from that church where these
[1:55:18] ladies go with the long hair?" That's
[1:55:20] exactly the church I go to. I know how
[1:55:22] did they tie me up with a long hair and
[1:55:24] I got short hair.
[1:55:29] Oh, there's some kind of there's some
[1:55:31] kind of affinity. There's some kind of
[1:55:34] manifestation.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; And they see it. Oh, my brother, my
[1:55:38] sister, this is the way of the Lord.
[1:55:41] Walk ye in it.
[1:55:51] When the tempter I'm closing now when
[1:55:53] the tempter came to Jesus said if thou
[1:55:55] be the son of God command that these
[1:55:58] stones be bread. Notice he said, "If
[1:56:00] thou be the son of God," notice now it
[1:56:03] come out of a different mouth, but it
[1:56:05] came the same words. When Jesus was on
[1:56:07] the cross, they said, "Uh,
[1:56:11] if thou be the son of God, come down
[1:56:13] from the cross." What was it? Same same
[1:56:16] spirit.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; The spirit that was in the tempter now
[1:56:20] was in his children.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Thou be the son of God, make these
[1:56:24] stones bread.
[1:56:26] there'll be the son of God come down
[1:56:28] from the cross. So even what he said was
[1:56:32] not consistent.
[1:56:34] But you know why it wasn't consistent?
[1:56:37] Because when that son of God was moving
[1:56:40] about
[1:56:41] and came into the into the area of the
[1:56:44] gatherines.
[1:56:46] There's two fierce men, wild men that
[1:56:49] nobody could pass that way. They tore
[1:56:52] chains couldn't hold them. They're wild
[1:56:54] men, demon-possessed men. When Jesus, he
[1:56:58] didn't, he didn't do anything
[1:56:59] spectacular. He just walked there. The
[1:57:02] manifested word. When he walked into
[1:57:04] their presence, they screamed out, "What
[1:57:06] have we to do with thee, thou Jesus, the
[1:57:09] son of God?" They knew he was the son of
[1:57:12] God. Satan isn't even consistent with
[1:57:15] his with his confession.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Once he's questioning it, next time he's
[1:57:19] screaming for help.
[1:57:23] No wonder. I mean, no wonder. I hope I
[1:57:25] wish you people could see what I say. No
[1:57:27] wonder when that prophet came out on the
[1:57:29] platform, he says the demons in that the
[1:57:31] demon up there and that person, the
[1:57:33] demon over here are screaming for help
[1:57:35] because they're afraid she's going to
[1:57:37] believe.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Can you accept that?
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; If you dare believe, you're going to
[1:57:45] cause demons to scream.
[1:57:48] They're going to scream for help.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Why don't you do that? Do you believe?
[1:57:53] Say the same thing. That's exactly
[1:57:55] what'll happen.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what'll happen.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; If you've harbored something, say, "Oh,
[1:58:02] God, I'm going to agree with your word.
[1:58:05] I'm going to say it."
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Demons just begin to scream
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; for mercy and for help.
[1:58:16] Have you come to torment us before our
[1:58:18] time? Well, you're not going to get the
[1:58:21] ultimate torment from me, but I'm
[1:58:23] certainly going to torment you all I
[1:58:24] can. Depart from me.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:37] harder to declare
[1:58:39] the manifested word.
[1:58:45] Jesus had disciples are with him and
[1:58:48] you're you're you're here in the
[1:58:50] congregation this morning
[1:58:53] and you sit here. Jesus had these
[1:58:55] disciples around him and
[1:58:58] when bread was multiplied, cooked fish,
[1:59:01] cooked bread, they gave it all out.
[1:59:04] There was no reproach.
[1:59:07] Everything he got into disputes and
[1:59:11] discussion and disputes, severe disputes
[1:59:13] with the Pharisees and the scribes and
[1:59:16] the Herodians and all of these people.
[1:59:19] And the disciples, they just they were
[1:59:20] part of the congregation. They sit there
[1:59:22] and listen. And then they took up
[1:59:24] stones. They never took up stones to
[1:59:27] stone the disciples.
[1:59:29] They were just associated yet. But they
[1:59:31] took up stones to stone him. the
[1:59:34] manifested word.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; They had had that written word for
[1:59:38] centuries, but now it was manifested. So
[1:59:41] they took up and they reproached him,
[1:59:43] spoke evil against him, said all kinds
[1:59:46] of things, and he's a illegitimate born,
[1:59:49] whatever more.
[1:59:52] But then Jesus said, you know, I've got
[1:59:55] to go. It's expedient that I go. If I
[1:59:58] don't go, the Holy Spirit won't come.
[2:00:00] But I'm going to go and I will send the
[2:00:02] Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit came
[2:00:04] into them, that's why the prophet said
[2:00:06] all the time, you got the Holy Ghost.
[2:00:08] You've got the Holy Ghost. Then
[2:00:10] everything is for you. You have the Holy
[2:00:12] Ghost. Then that very Christ, everything
[2:00:14] he was on the cross, everything he was
[2:00:15] in the tomb, everything he was in the
[2:00:17] resurrection in you.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say it?
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; It's in me.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Everything he was on the cross is in me.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; That's why a prophet comes says the
[2:00:26] token is in you.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Token isn't up in the heavens. The token
[2:00:30] is in some place in some office. The
[2:00:32] token's in you.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; You carry the token.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; But when that spirit came into them
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; immediately. Now the manifested word was
[2:00:43] in their flesh. Threw them in prison,
[2:00:46] killed James, stoned Steven right away.
[2:00:49] Why? Why did they take up stones for
[2:00:51] them? Didn't take it up in all the all
[2:00:53] the other years. But now they took it up
[2:00:54] because they were manifesting the word.
[2:00:57] [Applause]
[2:00:58] It's harder to manifest a word than it
[2:01:01] is just to speak or read the written
[2:01:03] word. So, I got the tapes. I got this. I
[2:01:05] got the MP3s. The devil's not worried
[2:01:07] about that. He's worried about what gets
[2:01:09] what gets out of here into you.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; And then starts being lived out.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; I want you to go out of this place today
[2:01:16] saying, "I have been I've been given
[2:01:18] life. God thought of me for so many
[2:01:20] millions of years or tens or hundreds of
[2:01:22] millions of years. He thought of me."
[2:01:24] That's not just something nice brother
[2:01:25] Bis was trying to say. I'm telling you
[2:01:26] the truth. God created that thought in
[2:01:28] his mind, brought you on the scene to
[2:01:31] manifest the word of the hour.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; And Satan hates it. You have to say, "I
[2:01:37] was made for it."
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; God loved fatherhood. And I have come as
[2:01:41] one of his children. I'm here now as one
[2:01:43] of his children.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; I come here to manifest it. It'll be
[2:01:47] harder than just reading it. Harder than
[2:01:49] just listening to it. I'm going to
[2:01:51] manifest it. I'm going to show it.
[2:01:54] Express it. Now, it's not just an
[2:01:55] expression. Say, "Well, I don't have it
[2:01:57] within me." Yeah, you have it. You might
[2:01:58] have to look hard at the map.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; You have it.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I was, you know, I I'm this.
[2:02:05] I'm British. I'm Irish. I got an Irish
[2:02:07] temper. I'm I'm Ukrainian. I'm stubborn.
[2:02:09] I got I'm German. I'm this. I'm that.
[2:02:12] I'm I'm American. I whatever." No.
[2:02:16] You're Christian.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; You're Christian.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; And you've got a land. It's called your
[2:02:22] inheritance in the Holy Ghost.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; And this needs to be developed.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Brother
[2:02:30] Brother Mike, you come, would you
[2:02:32] please?
[2:02:34] Brother Mike wrote a song and it'll mean
[2:02:37] more to you today. You know what it was?
[2:02:40] I'll die believing.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; I'll die believing.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; I'll die confessing.
[2:02:50] I want you to hear it.
[2:02:53] And uh I want I want you to s seriously
[2:02:55] consider maybe there's somebody here
[2:02:57] that needs to make a make a positive
[2:03:00] stand.
[2:03:02] I'm Forgive me. I've gone over time and
[2:03:05] I'm only partway through. I've just been
[2:03:08] so consumed with this glorious thing.
[2:03:11] Amen.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; You know, while brother
[2:03:20] I closed with this Wednesday and never
[2:03:23] got to it,
[2:03:26] I was saying the manifested word is
[2:03:28] harder. Now, it's hard for a lot of you
[2:03:30] folks perhaps to understand because I go
[2:03:32] back clean to a message in Phoenix from
[2:03:35] 1947.
[2:03:37] Now, just let me give you an overview
[2:03:39] while these brothers don't be
[2:03:40] distracted.
[2:03:43] 1947,
[2:03:44] brother Brandham's ministry is just
[2:03:46] breaking onto the scene.
[2:03:51] Houston hasn't happened yet. Durban,
[2:03:54] South Africa, hasn't happened yet.
[2:03:57] Bombay, India, and the blind man's eyes
[2:03:59] being created in his eyes hasn't
[2:04:00] happened yet. The throngs trying to tear
[2:04:02] his pants and clothes to get a little
[2:04:05] piece hasn't happened yet. 300,000 in
[2:04:08] Durban. The city streets choked till
[2:04:11] they have to close a 10-day meeting down
[2:04:13] to three because the city can't move.
[2:04:15] Hasn't happened yet. Seven huge stake
[2:04:19] farm trucks loaded with wheelchairs and
[2:04:21] all those. Hasn't happened yet. None of
[2:04:24] that's happened yet.
[2:04:27] The revival from 1948 to about 1958,
[2:04:31] mighty sweeping revival called the
[2:04:34] restoration of the gifts hasn't happened
[2:04:36] yet. Great moves of God, but here's what
[2:04:39] he said.
[2:04:41] Look, friends,
[2:04:44] it's hard to say that.
[2:04:48] It's hard for people to see that.
[2:04:51] And remember
[2:04:53] the Pentecostal age is a rejected age.
[2:04:57] Here he knew
[2:04:59] that a great re sweeping revival was
[2:05:02] just commencing.
[2:05:04] And he's telling the people, you talk
[2:05:07] about prophetic foresight, telling them
[2:05:10] it is a rejected age.
[2:05:13] And he says, "I hate to say that
[2:05:18] for I have never found faith in any
[2:05:20] church like the Pentecostal church." He
[2:05:23] was around his friends. He was around
[2:05:26] people who loved him. He was around
[2:05:27] people who'd die for him.
[2:05:30] He was around people who were going to
[2:05:31] give him perhaps tens of thousands,
[2:05:33] hundreds of thousands, and even into the
[2:05:35] millions of dollars for the campaigns
[2:05:37] and to keep it going. So, I hate to say
[2:05:39] that. And all they knew was what they
[2:05:41] were in was Pentecost. That's that's
[2:05:43] where God was,
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; That's all they knew.
[2:05:48] And he said, "But it's rejected
[2:05:51] because it's the Leodysian church age.
[2:05:54] Lukewarm.
[2:05:56] It will be prophecy." They never heard
[2:06:00] this prophecy. It will be spewed from
[2:06:04] the mouth of Christ.
[2:06:07] But God in there, God in there will draw
[2:06:12] out his people. That's also a prophecy.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; And I saw it spewed out of the mouth of
[2:06:20] God. But I also saw God drawing them out
[2:06:23] of there. And I'm here tonight to
[2:06:26] testify. Oh, Father, I thank you.
[2:06:30] you put something in our hearts
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; to respond.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; And he begins now to tell them after
[2:06:38] that there'll be a council that'll raise
[2:06:40] up. And 1947
[2:06:44] was the first time it even came into the
[2:06:46] minds of men, big theolog theological
[2:06:50] leaders to to to just assemble in a
[2:06:53] loose fashion. Nothing formalized. But
[2:06:56] in 1948 then his ministry sprung to go
[2:07:01] global and they had they
[2:07:04] institutionalized
[2:07:06] the world council of churches and it
[2:07:08] became a council and he forewarned them
[2:07:10] it will be a council.
[2:07:13] I tell you what, I have so many things.
[2:07:15] I hope I'm able and I hope I live long
[2:07:17] enough. I want to be able to I've got
[2:07:20] I've got a documentary called The
[2:07:22] Vatican Revealed. And I'd like to show
[2:07:24] you some things and tied right into what
[2:07:27] that prophet said, how how the Vatican
[2:07:30] will come in and take over America and
[2:07:32] how America will start to say the same
[2:07:35] thing that the Vatican says, the same
[2:07:39] thing that the Pope says. That beast
[2:07:42] coming out in in the 13th chapter will
[2:07:44] say the same thing. The beast before it
[2:07:46] said the same thing. And you have lived
[2:07:49] to see it.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Pathway to peace is not an invention of
[2:07:57] President
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; Bush. Amen.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; It's an invention of the Vatican because
[2:08:03] they've been pushing it for years.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Pathway to peace.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's pathway to destruction.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; I also would like to read in fact I'd
[2:08:15] like to put it on the screen for you.
[2:08:16] God help me to do all these things. It's
[2:08:18] just going through my mind. It's so hard
[2:08:20] for me to stop. I want to put on the
[2:08:22] screen for you out of the covenant. I
[2:08:24] have the covenant of the Palestinian
[2:08:26] people. I have their covenant that they
[2:08:28] do not believe in the state of Israel
[2:08:31] and they intend to push it into the sea
[2:08:33] and they intend to annihilate it.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; How do you have a road to peace? Road
[2:08:38] map to peace, road map to destruction.
[2:08:42] But the prince of peace
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; shall certainly come.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; And we're moving right to that hour now.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; He's going to do it.

[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; He became me
[2:14:17] so that I might be called him by grace.

[2:14:55] No doubt there are many who the Holy
[2:14:58] Spirit has spoke to. And I realize that
[2:15:03] not as a formality, but right where you
[2:15:05] are, you can make your heart an altar,
[2:15:10] a place where sacrifices are made.
[2:15:14] And I would so urge you to join with me
[2:15:18] while I seek to lay my life also on that
[2:15:22] altar.
[2:15:23] I want to be like him. I want his flame
[2:15:28] to come and consume the sacrifice.
[2:15:33] Take the time,
[2:15:35] the resource of time,
[2:15:38] the resource that he's deposited within
[2:15:41] us. May it not remain hidden and buried,
[2:15:44] but may it come to the surface.
[2:15:47] May the talents and gifts of God be
[2:15:49] developed
[2:15:51] for the benefit of the
[2:15:54] body of Jesus Christ, this beautiful
[2:15:56] bride that our Lord Jesus purchased at
[2:15:59] Calvary.
[2:16:02] There might be others.
[2:16:04] And if you're here,
[2:16:06] say, "I need help.
[2:16:09] I don't hardly know how to pray.
[2:16:12] I don't know what I should say,
[2:16:15] but I do know I have a great need.
[2:16:18] And if you want to step forward, if you
[2:16:20] wanted to kneel,
[2:16:22] there's a good number of brothers here,
[2:16:27] be happy, and they will come forward and
[2:16:30] pray with you. We have godly deacons
[2:16:33] know how to pray.
[2:16:35] And I'll tell you what friends, there is
[2:16:38] a resource of deliverance
[2:16:41] here within the church of the living
[2:16:43] God.
[2:16:44] And there is no power that can
[2:16:46] withstand.
[2:16:48] There's no power that can continue to
[2:16:51] bind when one of God's children says,
[2:16:55] "Father, I'm coming home." Not enough
[2:16:58] devils in hell to stop you.
[2:17:02] God only knows to do business with a
[2:17:05] true heart and with sincerity,
[2:17:09] a resolve and a determination.
[2:17:12] And if you are here, man, woman, child,
[2:17:16] whoever you might be, we'll be we'll do
[2:17:20] our part.
[2:17:22] You do your part
[2:17:24] and God through Jesus Christ will do his
[2:17:29] part.
[2:17:30] We'll sing it just another time or two.

[2:22:38] You feel the pull.
[2:22:41] Then yield. Just surrender and God have

[2:23:24] to them that believe.
[2:23:26] I believe that Satan is defeated.
[2:23:29] His head has been bruised at Calvary. He
[2:23:33] has lost his grip and power.

[2:27:40] those resources that God has placed
[2:27:42] within them? That encourages me cuz I
[2:27:46] know that there'll be a change within
[2:27:49] the whole atmosphere of the

[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thanks for your song this
[2:38:11] morning, Brother John.

[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; We're not going to give him any victory.
[2:38:32] We're not going to give him any ground.

[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; victorious.

[2:38:53] The anchor
[2:38:55] holds

[2:39:07] The anchor
[2:39:13] though the stone

[2:39:38] In spite of the storm,
[2:39:43] we know these verses. Let's sing that. I
[2:39:46] have journeyed
[2:39:51] through the long dark night,
[2:39:55] [Music]
[2:39:58] out on
[2:40:01] the ocean sea.
[2:40:07] My faith alone
[2:40:14] and sight unknown.
[2:40:18] [Music]
[2:40:21] And yet your hands
[2:40:24] were watching me.
[2:40:30] The anchor
[2:40:32] holds

[2:40:49] though the sails are torn.
[2:40:52] [Music]
[2:40:55] And I have fallen
[2:40:58] on my knees.
[2:41:02] As I face the raing seas, the anchor
[2:41:09] holds
[2:41:11] [Music]
[2:41:14] in spite of the storm.
[2:41:17] [Music]
[2:41:20] Thanks, brother. Thank you. Appreciate
[2:41:22] that.
[2:41:26] Hallelujah.
[2:41:28] I told brother Dalton the other day, I
[2:41:31] remember a certain meeting that we were
[2:41:32] in,
[2:41:34] special convention meeting,
[2:41:37] just asked him to come up and sing a
[2:41:40] song and I so missed it. I just so
[2:41:43] missed it.
[2:41:45] You know, we It's like taking a drink,
[2:41:49] like taking a drink out of a cool
[2:41:52] fountain of water. Here another hear the
[2:41:55] spirit of God to use that gift for the
[2:41:59] glory of God.
[2:42:01] [Music]
[2:42:02] We had a little gathering the other
[2:42:04] night for brother Ricardo
[2:42:08] and his mother and father were there. So
[2:42:12] nice to have them visiting you.
[2:42:15] sister was there
[2:42:18] and I don't know
[2:42:20] how many of you were here watch night
[2:42:22] service
[2:42:25] but I your father was here that service
[2:42:27] brother Ricardo
[2:42:29] and uh I was shaking his hand I didn't
[2:42:32] know didn't know brother Ricardo's
[2:42:34] father had ever been here been in church
[2:42:36] have to forgive me for that
[2:42:40] and he probably doesn't know this means
[2:42:41] anything but I'd had a song in my mind
[2:42:46] for probably a couple of days. It was I
[2:42:49] wonder if I've done my best for Jesus.
[2:42:53] And I just didn't know exactly what to
[2:42:56] do with it.
[2:42:59] And sometime I call on my wife
[2:43:03] that night. I felt a call on my sister
[2:43:06] and I just looked at Ann. I said I
[2:43:08] sometimes I fail to do something a
[2:43:10] little different. She was, you know, go
[2:43:13] for it. Go for it. And I looked real
[2:43:16] hard at her, you know, a little bit
[2:43:18] different. I said, well, you know, and
[2:43:20] she said,
[2:43:22] you folks didn't see all that, but I
[2:43:25] did. I said, well, no, I want you to
[2:43:27] come up. And
[2:43:29] what you don't know is some of you do or
[2:43:32] you don't know, my sister just had an
[2:43:34] operation
[2:43:36] down the side of her face. Long up,
[2:43:40] quite long. and they removed a a cyst.
[2:43:43] They didn't know but what it was
[2:43:45] cancerous. She had just had that
[2:43:47] operation just a few days before. So I
[2:43:50] knew I was pushing the envelope by
[2:43:53] asking you to come up and sing. But I
[2:43:55] felt so strong. And brother Ricardo, I
[2:43:59] want you to tell your daddy. He doesn't
[2:44:02] know what that meant to me. The other
[2:44:04] night I was just shaking hands with him
[2:44:06] at Ricardo's birthday and he said I was
[2:44:09] in the service watch night. I wanted you
[2:44:12] to hear this an I want the congregation
[2:44:14] to hear it. And he said you had someone
[2:44:17] I believe it was your sister. He said
[2:44:19] come up and sing. I said yes that was my
[2:44:22] sister. He said it was very moving. So I
[2:44:26] was moved.
[2:44:29] Thank him for me. have that touched me
[2:44:32] and I'm sure it means something to you
[2:44:33] an
[2:44:35] in the simplicity and perhaps with the
[2:44:37] difficulty
[2:44:39] the operation affected her throat a bit
[2:44:41] at the time
[2:44:44] still got up and sang
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; I wonder if I done my best for Jesus I'd
[2:44:50] like you to go out from this
[2:44:51] congregation this morning knowing God's
[2:44:54] real
[2:44:55] &gt;&gt; God's close
[2:44:58] and believe me you're rich.
[2:45:02] You are rich.
[2:45:04] Rich in Christ. God bless you. Brother
[2:45:07] DJ pleased with you. Come and pray God's
[2:45:10] blessing upon us. And we're going to be

[2:45:57] called us to. Lord, we're thankful for
[2:46:00] your servant and the atmosphere you have
[2:46:03] given us in this place, oh God.
[2:46:06] We do not want to ever take it for
[2:46:08] granted. We want to say thank you from
[2:46:10] the depths of our heart.
[2:46:12] Lord, would you continue to move and
[2:46:14] deal with us in this way? This is what
[2:46:17] we live for, Father.
[2:46:19] Bless your servant and your people and
[2:46:23] cause your spirit to just go with each
[2:46:25] one. And bring us back prepared again
[2:46:28] for the next portion for the day. We
[2:46:31] thank you in Jesus name. Amen.

[2:46:38] one another. Would you please
