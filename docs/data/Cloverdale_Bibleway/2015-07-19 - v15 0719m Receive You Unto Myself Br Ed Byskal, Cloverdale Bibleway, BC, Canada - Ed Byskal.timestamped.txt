[5:53] Gyra.
[5:54] You have provided, Lord God. And we come
[5:57] to you in faith, believing. Lord, that
[6:00] you are the provider of all of our

[7:12] Have your way, oh God.
[7:15] Just going to ask brother John Andy's to
[7:17] come and take us to the throne of grace
[7:20] this morning.
[7:22] We have a number of prayer requests and
[7:26] know that God is faithful to hear and to
[7:29] answer every need and every prayer. He
[7:32] has proven it over and over and over
[7:34] again. and you stand in faith this
[7:36] morning believing that all things are
[7:39] possible to them that believe.
[7:42] Praise the name of the Lord. Brother
[7:46] Ellie Gindle
[7:49] writes in he has a friend who's having a
[7:52] child, a boy in the next couple weeks
[7:54] and the doctor said the baby may have
[7:56] heart problems.
[7:58] So he asked me to pray and bring a
[8:01] prayer request before the church.
[8:04] So we're praying for a complete
[8:05] recovery.
[8:07] Amen. All things are possible.
[8:11] Sister Johanna Rav Barbara the Milka's
[8:13] wife is in need of prayer this morning
[8:18] for a ongoing condition and we just want
[8:21] to remember her before the Lord.
[8:23] Remember brother Sam Waldner also and
[8:26] brother Frank has brother Frank Fletcher
[8:29] has written in that he just would like
[8:32] us to all remember
[8:35] that it's uh we're in need of rain this
[8:38] morning
[8:40] naturally
[8:41] also spiritually we want the Holy Spirit
[8:43] to rain down but it's very very dry and
[8:45] it's unusual to ask for rain in
[8:47] Vancouver but God is God knows our needs
[8:51] amen
[8:52] so
[8:54] just ask brother John to come and take
[8:56] these requests to the throne of grace
[9:00] [Music]
[9:11] [Music]
[9:15] We want to lift up our voices
[9:23] at the end
[9:26] that people
[9:29] don't come to you with burden and
[9:31] perplexity.
[9:33] But we come to you with a real love in
[9:35] our heart.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; We want to see more of your pres.
[9:41] We want to have the presence of our
[9:43] husband come throughout this service.
[9:45] Come into this little meeting, Lord,
[9:47] into this place that we've dedicated to
[9:49] you. We want to dedicate our hearts to
[9:52] you. We want to dedicate our lives to
[9:54] you. We see the world that has fallen
[9:57] apart. Satan's Eden and the God of this
[10:00] evil age is taking quickly to a
[10:03] tribulation and to a hell. But we've
[10:05] been called to a another dimension.
[10:08] We've been called to another place. We
[10:10] believe our home, our future home
[10:13] calling to us. Come up a little high.
[10:16] Come away, little bride. We were in the
[10:18] spirit of the Lord's day. Lord, we see
[10:21] these things in the scripture. We've
[10:23] heard them by this prophet's message in
[10:25] our day that we've received. and you
[10:28] sent us ministers after your own heart
[10:30] that would get into a channel that would
[10:32] deliver us to the heart and the mind of
[10:34] God. This morning, we're coming with our
[10:37] cons.
[10:38] Lord, we're coming as a people that are
[10:41] affected by the supernatural. Lord,
[10:43] we're a people that look to the heart of
[10:45] God for our direction. We look to you
[10:48] for our healing. We look to you for our
[10:50] deliverance. We look to you Lord Jesus
[10:53] because you are the author and the
[10:55] finisher Lord of our faith. So Lord
[10:58] every need that's in the building today
[11:01] out across the internet Lord or what's
[11:03] been spoken we believe that it's already
[11:05] been met Lord according to your riches
[11:08] and glory. Lord I just want to lift up
[11:10] my hand as a testimony believing that
[11:12] you're the God that answers every prayer
[11:15] every need Lord. every individual,
[11:19] &gt;&gt; every heart, Lord, you know our
[11:21] thoughts. You know our desires. You know
[11:24] what we have need of. Father, we pray
[11:26] for each one of these spoken requests.
[11:28] So Hannah, Lord, that you would still in
[11:30] her life. Brother Fletcher, Lord, was
[11:33] down in Louisiana one day and they had
[11:36] in need of rain and you begin to pray
[11:38] and you sent a great outpouring, a great
[11:41] rain came across that place. We believe
[11:44] you can do the same for this valley.
[11:47] place that we live in Vancouver that you
[11:49] would just come and sweep by this place
[11:52] of the needs that brother Ellie's
[11:54] request that he brought. There's many
[11:56] unspoken requests. Gather all of our
[11:58] hearts, Lord, into your bosom today,
[12:01] Lord. And rapture us into heavenly
[12:04] places. Forgive us of our sins. Forgive
[12:07] us of any iniquity, Lord, individually
[12:10] and our family and our assembly and for
[12:13] the body of Christ, Lord. As life flows
[12:16] through the body, may Jesus Christ flow
[12:18] through the service today across the
[12:21] land and other places. May you move,
[12:24] Lord. We're expecting, Lord, you speak
[12:26] to our pastor today, expecting you to
[12:29] use the gift of his to minister
[12:31] spiritual food in this season of time.
[12:35] anoint him for service even now. Give
[12:37] him strength, Lord, to deliver his
[12:39] heart.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; Deliver the burden of the word of this
[12:42] Lord.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; He will respond, Lord.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; We say yes, Lord Jesus.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, fill our hearts with the Holy
[12:49] Ghost.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; Fill us with healing in our bodies, fill
[12:52] him with a deliverance in our spirit.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; That your people would truly be a joy
[12:58] and rich and we would please your heart
[13:01] as our husband. We give you the service
[13:03] and the offering, Lord. Multiply it in
[13:06] every heart and life to give to you. And
[13:09] those that cannot give, Lord, bless the
[13:11] people, minister to the sheep today in
[13:14] Jesus Christ's name.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:18] [Music]
[13:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother John.
[13:25] You can have your seats this morning
[13:28] as they take up the offering. Let's just
[13:30] sing hold to God's unchanging hand.

[16:37] Hold down.
[16:43] Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Just going to
[16:46] ask brother Michael Ray to come up. He's
[16:48] got an announcement for camp and let him
[16:51] come up and do that while we sing the
[16:52] chorus once more. Hold to God's
[16:57] unchanging hand.
[17:01] Hold God's unchanging hand.

[17:21] &gt;&gt; Good morning.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; Ah, love it. Wonderful to hear you
[17:25] respond that way.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, it's one week to camp and uh
[17:31] we're getting all the last little pieces
[17:33] worked out there. And hope everybody's
[17:35] excited.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Frank, I'm just going to put a a
[17:38] weak cap on that prayer for rain because
[17:41] I do want sun for summer camp. Okay.
[17:44] So if you're praying, be specific. Lord,
[17:46] we need rain up till
[17:48] Okay. July 27th is the date.
[17:53] All right. Uh we do have a counselor's
[17:55] meeting after the service uh just in the
[17:57] chapel. So all counselors, if uh after
[18:00] service, if you can be there nice and
[18:01] prompt, that would be wonderful.
[18:04] Uh next Monday at 9:00, we will be
[18:08] starting our junior camp there. So we
[18:10] want to make sure that everyone is
[18:11] prompt. uh 9:00 for counselors, 10
[18:14] o'clock for campers. And so if you're a
[18:17] counselor, please be uh please be prompt
[18:19] there.
[18:21] Uh
[18:22] we do want to make sure that if just
[18:24] please let us know if you don't plan to
[18:26] arrive on camp at the start exact
[18:29] starting time. We just want to know any
[18:30] late comers if you if you do know that.
[18:31] Most of you have told us, but if you
[18:33] haven't, please just let myself or
[18:34] sister Abigail know.
[18:38] Sunday evening service or so I should
[18:40] say Sunday morning service after the
[18:42] service on August 2nd the grounds will
[18:45] be open for a uh for a picnic. You can
[18:47] stay there on grounds. The families can
[18:49] stay there and bring a picnic on
[18:50] grounds. Uh lunch is only for the for
[18:54] those registered on grounds as a camper.
[18:58] And we're doing something a little bit
[19:00] different this year. Brother Kim is
[19:02] going to be uh we're going to be
[19:05] utilizing the bus and for uh we're use
[19:08] it as an option. And so sometimes we
[19:11] have people that don't uh you know
[19:13] aren't able to come up to the grounds
[19:15] and they're they're trying to get a
[19:16] carpool and trying to figure out a way
[19:17] to get up there. And so we are going to
[19:20] make the bus available for Thursday
[19:23] senior camp uh morning at 8:00 here at
[19:26] the church. uh if you don't if you're
[19:28] not able to to get a ride, uh the bus is
[19:31] going to be available to do that. But we
[19:33] want to get an idea of who's available
[19:35] or who's uh who could require that
[19:37] option. So, we want you to call the
[19:38] office and talk to Sister Megan and uh
[19:41] let us know so we can kind of get an
[19:43] idea of of a count. Uh it's for those
[19:46] that don't have a ride. If you do have a
[19:49] ride and you're able to uh to make your
[19:51] way, please do so and and leave those
[19:52] seats available for those that can't.
[19:55] We're going to do the same thing for the
[19:57] evening services as well. And uh
[20:00] departing from cost cutter in Blaine.
[20:02] For the evening services, we've kind of
[20:05] set a time of 5:30. The bus would depart
[20:07] from cost cutter in Blaine and will also
[20:10] help uh uh take people to the camp uh
[20:13] for each of the Sunday uh each of the
[20:15] evening services on Thursday, Friday,
[20:17] Saturday, and then on Sunday morning as
[20:20] well. Again, if you if that is something
[20:22] that you could use, please call the
[20:23] office and let us know. uh who uh so we
[20:26] can get an idea of on on some numbers
[20:30] meals on grounds. Uh just a little bit
[20:32] of a a note uh for I know people come up
[20:35] early for the services. Sometimes they
[20:36] come up a bit early on the services and
[20:39] sometimes maybe a hair too early because
[20:40] we're still eating dinner. Uh dinner is
[20:43] again meals are for registered campers
[20:45] only. It's not to come into the dining
[20:48] hall there and and uh and uh partake of
[20:51] a meal. Uh please. All right.
[20:55] My one last one here uh is a a little
[20:58] bit of a different policy change. Uh we
[21:00] have it in our camper rules, but it's
[21:02] maybe been kind of looked over, but we
[21:05] are eliminating the electronic devices
[21:09] on campgrounds as much as possible. And
[21:11] so, senior campers, uh do not bother
[21:14] bringing them this year, uh or you'll
[21:17] just be handing them over to me at the
[21:19] beginning of camp. Um, we're giving you
[21:22] a lot of warnings. So, you can get a
[21:23] disposable camera or something like that
[21:25] or even buy an alarm clock if you use
[21:27] your phone for those purposes. Uh, but
[21:30] we are going to try and just keep keep
[21:32] ourselves secluded. It's one thing I I
[21:35] surely enjoy about the camp is you can
[21:36] get up there and you can disconnect.
[21:38] But, uh, unfortunately over the time uh,
[21:41] cell signal becomes more and more
[21:43] prevalent and and you don't get so
[21:45] disconnected up there anymore. So, uh,
[21:47] we are going to again
[21:50] park your device at home. Worst case
[21:53] scenario, going to park it in the car
[21:54] and lock it there and throw away the key
[21:56] for the week and, uh, and not let it
[21:58] escape.
[22:00] All right, that's all I have.
[22:04] I'll have a wonderful service and we'll
[22:05] see you at camp in a week.
[22:12] We just uh
[22:16] we're excited for camp to come and see
[22:18] what God's going to do. And we're in
[22:20] great anticipation, expectation, and uh
[22:23] just also announcement. There will also
[22:25] be a a prayer meeting this Friday night
[22:29] uh just before camp. So, we just want to
[22:31] gather together and uh
[22:34] bring the young people before the Lord
[22:37] and the services and we just want God to
[22:39] move in a mighty way. We also have a
[22:43] number of people here that we'd uh that
[22:45] are visiting us from other places and um
[22:50] there's a brother Darren and brother
[22:52] Joel from Edmonton. Um, not sure where
[22:55] they're sitting, but we just want to
[22:59] just want to welcome you. There you are.
[23:01] God bless you. Just welcome.
[23:07] And um,
[23:09] I don't quite know how to say this name,
[23:11] but uh, the Debasi family from Sydney,
[23:15] Australia. Is that yourselves? Yes.
[23:17] Would you? We welcome you, Andrew,
[23:20] Rebecca, and Simon.
[23:24] and um and a sister Miriam who's going
[23:28] to school in Seattle, sister-in-law,

[23:35] also. God bless you
[23:39] and all those that are streaming with us

[25:47] &gt;&gt; You don't want rain. We We like the
[25:50] sunshine.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; And we especially like the inner
[25:53] sunshine. Amen. Uh we're thankful for
[25:57] everyone that has remained here behind
[25:59] and after the wedding.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I thought it is.
[26:14] We need to be miked. Okay. Is that
[26:17] better?
[26:18] &gt;&gt; All right.
[26:20] Uh
[26:22] I have switched it on actually, but I
[26:25] guess I didn't switch it far enough. So,
[26:27] we want to be tuned in this morning. Uh
[26:31] really been looking to the Lord for the
[26:32] last few weeks. And just so that you
[26:35] know as a congregation I had uh I was
[26:38] moving forward on a subject. I had notes
[26:41] and I just thought the Lord was going to
[26:42] inspire it about two weeks ago. It just
[26:47] turn right angles or left angles
[26:49] whatever you want to call it. And uh uh
[26:53] so I began on uh began
[26:57] not pondering but really searching out
[27:00] what the mind of God might be for this
[27:02] service.
[27:04] I'm just giving these like a preamble
[27:07] because uh I want you to think about it
[27:09] a wee bit. And then and then while I was
[27:12] in the midst of that, you know, a a
[27:15] whole section of scripture came to me
[27:18] and I thought, well, it doesn't apply.
[27:21] It doesn't really fit. I I wouldn't even
[27:23] know where to insert that. It wasn't
[27:26] until yesterday it all came back and I
[27:29] just couldn't shake it. You know,
[27:31] there's one thing I've learned about
[27:32] God. He says the same thing every time.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; It'll be a still small voice, but he
[27:38] just keeps saying the same thing. It
[27:40] doesn't have to come with thunder and
[27:42] lightning and pillars of fire, you know.
[27:45] He just keeps saying the same thing. And
[27:48] when you can't shake that, then you want
[27:50] to stand still and listen.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:55] We have a a deacon that uh has been
[28:00] serving as a deacon for a long time,
[28:02] brother Jose. I wonder, brother Jose, if
[28:05] you would come forward. And we never
[28:07] have formally installed him, but he, you
[28:12] know, the brother Brown taught that we
[28:14] should call a deacon and ask him to
[28:17] serve and serve for, you know, a few
[28:20] months and then if he likes it and the
[28:23] people like him uh the people we like,
[28:27] brother Jose.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:30] Brother Jose is more than just a figure
[28:32] and he's more than someone that just
[28:34] seats people when there's things to do
[28:37] and people in need. He's always been
[28:40] very very helpful. We want to pray for
[28:43] brother Jose. We're going to formally
[28:46] install him. But I want to say that
[28:50] brother Jose has a job that's been uh
[28:55] keeping him away sometimes on weekend
[28:58] way up in the mountains. So maybe you'll
[29:01] join with us as we prayer to pray to
[29:03] install our brother Jose formally. This
[29:06] is just a formality because he's been
[29:09] operating as a deacon and we're very
[29:11] very happy with his work and very happy
[29:14] with his dedication. But more than that,
[29:18] uh, we we need him.
[29:22] We want to see you. And every time
[29:25] brother Jose is away, uh, for a weekend
[29:28] or whatever, you know, he misses us.
[29:31] Isn't that nice? And we miss him.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; So, I'll just ask the brothers to come
[29:36] and we'll, Brother Jose, if you'll step
[29:39] forward, please.
[29:48] Dear heavenly father,
[29:52] &gt;&gt; this is an honor to lay our hands upon a
[29:54] brother.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; When he was a far from this place, he
[30:01] heard your voice
[30:03] &gt;&gt; and he responded, oh God, and he's
[30:06] remained steadfast
[30:09] &gt;&gt; to that still small voice. He has heard
[30:11] that voice
[30:12] &gt;&gt; over and over and he has heeded that
[30:15] voice.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; And I pray, Father, you'll even make him
[30:18] more sensitive.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; He's been sensitive to the needs of the
[30:22] people. I pray, oh God, that you will
[30:24] anoint him for service,
[30:26] &gt;&gt; even more so. Send a double portion upon
[30:29] him. I pray that you will look upon him,
[30:32] Father, with such favor that you will
[30:35] change his job situation, that he might
[30:38] be able to be near the congregation. He
[30:41] desired to be living near the
[30:43] congregation. And you gave him a home,
[30:46] oh God, right, right next to the parking
[30:49] lot. And this is one of the few families
[30:52] that walked to church. I pray that you
[30:54] will bless him, oh God. Bless his wife,
[30:57] oh God. bless his children, Father. May
[31:00] the spirit of God that sent this word
[31:03] reveal it to them. May they feed upon it
[31:07] in the name of Jesus Christ, Lord. And
[31:10] now we receive him and with the with the
[31:14] call upon his life and that you will not
[31:17] only hear our words for installing a
[31:20] deacon but he has been he's been
[31:24] pleasing oh God to us and we thank you
[31:27] for him in the name of Jesus Christ. May
[31:31] he now take this position father which
[31:34] has been on his heart and he has
[31:37] requested this Lord. We lay hands upon
[31:40] him for that purpose
[31:42] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ. May his life be
[31:44] fulfilled
[31:45] &gt;&gt; with service to your bride.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; We thank you Jesus. Amen.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Jose.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:05] Well, another family that we're happy to
[32:06] have and haven't had for a long time is
[32:10] Wesley Ordeal.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[32:14] and their three children.

[32:22] family. I guess the children are going
[32:24] to come and sing. You'll do that,
[32:26] Brother Wes.

[32:41] Isn't it nice to have a family that
[32:43] sings?
[32:48] Naomi and mea. Mea and Naomi.
[32:54] And they called her son Dawson.
[32:56] I was happy for that. That's where my
[32:59] wife was born. That's where we lived.
[33:03] That's where your mother was born was.
[33:07] And so we're thankful for that. God
[33:10] bless you. Uh
[33:13] you're going to say a word of greeting
[33:14] to us. Certainly. All right.
[33:19] God bless you. It certainly is good to
[33:21] be home and uh to see all the smiling
[33:23] faces to be in this wonderful atmosphere
[33:25] of worship and

[33:30] we're living in. Amen.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; It's it's a wonderful hour to be a part
[33:34] of and all these things that are coming
[33:35] to pass
[33:37] &gt;&gt; uh where people are blinded to. We've
[33:39] been it's been revealed to us and we're
[33:41] certainly thankful for that. And uh as
[33:44] my grandfather said, it's uh this is me.
[33:47] She's 12 years old. my oldest daughter
[33:49] and Naomi who is 8 years old and Dawson
[33:52] who is six and my wife is also with me
[33:55] and I know better than to say beyond
[33:58] that but we're certainly happy as a
[34:00] family to be here together and
[34:02] &gt;&gt; to be a part of uh of this family of
[34:04] God. Amen.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; So looking forward to camp and all those
[34:08] wonderful things to come. So we trust
[34:10] that these couple of songs will be a
[34:11] blessing to you. Amen.
[34:13] [Music]
[34:24] There's a country
[34:27] [Music]
[34:30] where I'm going.
[34:35] There are matches
[34:40] standing tall.
[34:43] Here
[34:46] there's trles
[34:51] and triulation,
[34:56] but he will take me
[35:01] through it all.
[35:06] Through it all,
[35:12] he will take me.
[35:17] I may stumble
[35:22] and I may fall,
[35:27] but he loves me.
[35:32] He'll not forsake
[35:35] me.
[35:36] [Music]
[35:37] He will take me
[35:42] through it all.
[35:47] When I'm burdened
[35:52] and broken hearted,
[35:57] I think of that morning
[36:02] when he shall call.
[36:08] All my trles
[36:12] will then be over.
[36:18] He will take me
[36:22] through it all.
[36:27] Through it all.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; He will take me.
[36:38] I may stumble
[36:42] and I may fall.
[36:48] Why he loves me?
[36:52] He'll not forsake
[36:55] me.
[36:57] He will take me.
[37:02] Through it all,
[37:07] through it all,
[37:12] he will take me.
[37:17] I may stumble
[37:22] and I may fall,
[37:27] but he loves me.
[37:31] will not forsake me.
[37:36] He will take me
[37:41] through it all.
[37:46] He will take me
[37:52] through it all.
[38:06] Girls, before you go, first I'm a mela
[38:10] mea. Yeah, you and you can come back if
[38:14] you don't mind. First time I heard uh
[38:16] I'm amazed
[38:18] &gt;&gt; that Jesus loved me was me sang it here.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; That was lovely.
[38:25] And I'd like the congregation to stand
[38:27] and we'll just sing that together. I'm
[38:30] amazed. Would you lead us, Wesley,
[38:32] please?
[38:40] I'm amazed
[38:44] that you love me.
[38:48] Oh, I'm amazed
[38:53] how you came.
[38:58] Through your preious
[39:01] blood I found for me
[39:07] and my sins
[39:10] are
[39:11] [Music]
[39:12] all washed away.
[39:16] All my sins
[39:18] are wash
[39:21] away.
[39:22] Oh, I know. I
[39:30] love me.
[39:32] Oh, I
[39:35] [Applause]
[39:38] came.
[39:42] Through your precious
[39:45] blood I found
[39:48] [Music]
[39:51] and my sins
[39:54] are washed
[39:58] away.
[40:00] [Music]
[40:08] Oh, I
[40:10] [Music]
[40:13] rol
[40:16] [Music]
[40:22] [Applause]
[40:23] [Music]
[40:26] through your precious
[40:29] blood. I found
[40:35] my sh
[40:38] are washed.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, they're all washed away. All my sins
[40:46] are washed
[40:48] away.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads, please. We
[40:54] thank you, Father.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Not only our sins are washed away, but
[40:58] through the blood of Jesus Christ, we've
[41:00] been reconciled,
[41:02] &gt;&gt; brought back. Oh, God. We thank you,
[41:04] Father, that as we read the scriptures,
[41:07] we are approaching the author. Now, any
[41:11] man with strength can just turn the
[41:13] pages, but it takes more than turning
[41:15] the pages to hear what is spoken. Oh
[41:18] God, we pray that you'll give us ears to
[41:21] hear. And may we hear the voice of the
[41:24] spirit in this last days. And may the
[41:27] bride say the same thing
[41:28] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. We pray
[41:31] that you will anoint the congregation to
[41:33] hear. Anoint those that are streaming.
[41:35] Father, I pray that they will hear
[41:37] things that they need to hear. And I
[41:39] ask, oh God, you'll give us the capacity
[41:42] to receive, Father, these things that
[41:44] you have for us. In the name of Jesus
[41:47] Christ, we ask it. Amen.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Wes. Amanda Naomi,
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amanda, I called your name because
[42:00] you're
[42:01] important part of this.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; You have to be careful what you do
[42:08] sometimes. I took Wesley down to
[42:10] Tennessee
[42:12] and he saw a floor uh saw an Georgia
[42:17] peach
[42:20] and he liked it better than the Okonogan
[42:22] peaches. So that was it. That was the
[42:25] end of it. Now we've got a family and
[42:28] we're happy for it.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; We're happy for them being a a blessing
[42:32] at brother Yansy's church uh in
[42:35] Covington and sent greetings for us
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Wesley when you get to see brother Yansy
[42:42] again. God bless you all. We'll turn in
[42:45] the Bible, please, to uh John the 14th
[42:49] chapter.
[43:04] This is the text to things that are to
[43:07] be
[43:09] on the
[43:11] 6th of December, 1965.
[43:15] And after this was modern events made
[43:18] clear by prophecy and after that was
[43:22] leadership.
[43:24] Brother Brandham had communion and left.
[43:29] He said in that message which I have
[43:32] here, he said uh Jesus life was fixing
[43:36] to end here on earth. He was talking
[43:39] about our lives and the body that we
[43:42] have been given here to live and live
[43:44] here. He said Jesus life was fixing to
[43:48] leave here on earth.
[43:50] Jesus knew when he said those words
[43:53] because he knows all things. Jesus knew
[43:57] that in the messenger that he would send
[43:59] to reveal who through he would reveal
[44:02] himself
[44:03] &gt;&gt; would take this cho choose this
[44:05] scripture for things that are to be
[44:09] &gt;&gt; and his life was fixing to end on earth
[44:13] &gt;&gt; in a few days
[44:15] that very month
[44:17] and so he said Jesus' life was fixing to
[44:20] end and brother Brandham's life was
[44:22] fixing to end you don't put those things
[44:25] together by accident.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; We have to realize and don't be
[44:29] doubting.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; Don't be questioning.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Just realize that our Lord has done
[44:36] special things
[44:37] &gt;&gt; and just ask him to give you a special
[44:40] visitation
[44:41] &gt;&gt; this morning that you might grasp those
[44:43] things
[44:44] &gt;&gt; that are intended for us at this time so
[44:47] we don't miss it.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Very seldom did the disciples get too
[44:52] much. They generally were on the, you
[44:55] know, kind of the
[44:57] bottom end of of really understanding
[44:59] what was happening. What's happening?
[45:01] Where's the miracles? Where's where
[45:03] where's his power? Where's all of these
[45:05] things happening? And now he's silent.
[45:07] Where's where's the voice? Where's the
[45:09] great messages and so on at the end of
[45:13] Jesus' life?
[45:15] and we'll find I I just pray that God
[45:17] will give us the capacity to take the
[45:20] types and take the shadows and take
[45:22] those things. That's why they're called
[45:23] shadows of the scriptures and be able to
[45:26] apply them and see them today. Oh,
[45:28] that's now.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; That's here. That's now. We're in it.
[45:32] Say, help us to see that.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; So, we'll read
[45:37] starting with 14 the first verse.
[45:40] Let not your heart be troubled. You
[45:43] believe in God, believe also in me. In
[45:46] my father's house are many mansions. If
[45:50] it were not so, I would have told you. I
[45:53] go to prepare a place for you. And if I
[45:56] go and prepare a place for you, I will
[45:59] come again and receive you unto myself,
[46:03] that where I am, there ye may be also.
[46:07] And whether I go, you know, and the way
[46:09] you know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord.
[46:12] See, they weren't grasping it. Lord, we
[46:15] know not whether thou goest. And how can
[46:17] we know the way? And Jesus said unto
[46:20] him, I am the way, the truth, and the
[46:23] life, and no man cometh unto the father
[46:26] but by me. If you had known me,
[46:30] he's talking to people that's followed
[46:31] him and given everything to follow. If
[46:33] you had known me, you should have known
[46:36] my father also. And from henceforth you
[46:39] know him and have seen him. Philip sith
[46:42] unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and
[46:45] it sufficeth us. Jesus sith unto him,
[46:48] have I been so long time with you, and
[46:51] yet hast thou not known me, Philillip?
[46:54] He that hath seen me hath seen the
[46:57] Father. And how sayest thou then, show
[47:00] us the Father.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're so glad we've heard a
[47:03] message.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Show us the Father. And on one on one of
[47:08] those services, Brother Brandham says,
[47:10] "Would you like to see the Father?"
[47:13] &gt;&gt; And before that service was over, they
[47:15] saw the Father.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be have you may have your
[47:19] seats.
[47:30] I want you to notice please if you still
[47:31] have your Bible open to the third verse.
[47:40] And if I go to prepare a place for you,
[47:45] I will come again
[47:48] and receive you unto myself,
[47:52] that where I am, not where I will be,
[47:55] where I am, there ye may be also.
[48:01] I want you to notice these four things.
[48:04] I go to prepare a place for you.
[48:09] I will come again
[48:12] and receive you unto myself
[48:16] that where I am there you may be also.
[48:26] To receive, I'm just laying this as a
[48:29] foundation. To receive is to take
[48:31] oneself
[48:33] as a companion.
[48:36] To accept or acknowledge one to be such
[48:39] as he professes to be
[48:43] to receive
[48:45] you to
[48:49] to accept and receive one
[48:51] &gt;&gt; as they profess to be. Well, I have a
[48:55] lot of questions. I don't know about
[48:56] this. I really don't know. That's how
[48:59] you'll be received. But if you say, "I
[49:02] believe." Lord, help thou me to believe.
[49:06] That's how you're accepted and received.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; And then to receive is not to reject.
[49:14] You don't reject and you're not being
[49:16] rejected.
[49:18] To receive is to claim for oneself
[49:22] of that which when taken is not let go.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; He's not going to let you go. Amen.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; He's going to receive you and seize and
[49:32] lay hold upon you.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; And apprehend.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Now, here's a quote in this things that
[49:39] are to be. And this is what I hope that
[49:42] you can lay hold of as the Holy Spirit
[49:46] spoke to me many years ago and many,
[49:48] many, many times since. Now he was
[49:52] telling them that after death there was
[49:55] there is life because
[49:58] I go and prepare a place that is
[50:02] to receive them.
[50:05] I go to prepare a place that is to
[50:07] receive them and and I'm going to be
[50:10] dwelling on the message was sent to
[50:14] receive you.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; That's why it was sent.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. to that is to receive them shows
[50:21] that there he was speaking to them that
[50:24] there was a life after this life is
[50:27] ended. And what a consolation that ought
[50:29] to give to all of us to know that after
[50:32] this life is over. There is a life that
[50:34] we go into. And as you get older, that
[50:37] becomes more of a reality to you. As you
[50:40] begin to see the days of your life
[50:42] drawing close, then you begin to pack up
[50:46] closer, getting ready for that great
[50:48] event. It's a continuing of this life,
[50:51] this same life in another world, another
[50:55] place. If we could just grasp the depth
[50:58] of that.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Now, many of you are probably uh
[51:04] younger, a whole lot younger than I am.
[51:08] That has nothing to do with it.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; It has to do with where we are in God's
[51:13] word.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; This world is getting old.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; This world has become very, very violent
[51:20] and wicked and sinful. This world, as
[51:23] the scripture says, will wax worse and
[51:25] worse, and God will fold it up as he
[51:28] doth a garment and lay it aside. But
[51:31] he'll create a new heaven and a new
[51:32] earth wherein dwells righteousness and
[51:35] his children all his children
[51:39] &gt;&gt; will be there.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:43] So now I just wanted you to
[51:47] uh catch if you would that is
[51:54] if you if you could if brother Brandham
[51:56] was standing here and you could hear him
[51:59] say these words. I go to prepare a place
[52:02] for you. Jesus is saying this right at
[52:05] the very conclusion of his days on
[52:07] earth.
[52:09] And now in in the vessel that he chose
[52:11] to reveal himself right in the
[52:13] conclusion of his time on earth,
[52:16] &gt;&gt; he's saying the same thing.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; I go to prepare a place. Not not
[52:22] Brandon. He's not going to prepare a
[52:23] place. He's talking about someone. I go
[52:26] to prepare a place for you that where I
[52:28] am.
[52:30] And we have to come to a final
[52:33] conclusion.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. a resolve within ourselves. I'm
[52:38] looking down on you. I'm looking at you.
[52:42] We have to come to that resolve that
[52:45] there was a a lot of people knew Moses,
[52:48] but they didn't know the one that came
[52:50] back with him
[52:51] &gt;&gt; right
[52:51] &gt;&gt; from the desert.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; A lot of people knew William Brandon,
[52:54] but they didn't know the one that came
[52:56] back with him. And Jesus said, "He that
[53:00] is with me."
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; They knew Jesus of Nazareth and he's,
[53:04] you know, we have his mother and his
[53:05] brethren and his father here. That
[53:08] wasn't him. That's why they missed him
[53:10] &gt;&gt; because they knew him. But they didn't
[53:12] know him. Didn't know the one that was
[53:15] speaking through him. Didn't know the
[53:17] one. They hadn't had a relationship, an
[53:20] association, a companion. they hadn't
[53:23] become uh knowledgeable that they were
[53:26] they were uh had been received.
[53:30] Yesterday we had a ceremony here and a
[53:34] young man and a young lady
[53:36] sister Abigail and brother Jeremy
[53:41] and I knew that I was going to say
[53:44] something about this.
[53:46] They had to come down willingly to stand
[53:50] here. Amen.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; They had to come with the intent.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; He with the intent. I am receiving her
[53:57] &gt;&gt; and she is receiving me and I am giving
[54:00] myself and she is giving herself to the
[54:04] offices according to the word of God.
[54:07] And that's precisely why we've come to
[54:09] church. That's why you're here this
[54:11] morning because I've come to receive
[54:14] something and I've come to be received.
[54:16] Amen.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; What is it that you would like me to
[54:19] know something about? I I want to expand
[54:22] on this being received.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says that God will send
[54:26] a man to the pullpit
[54:28] &gt;&gt; to say something that you need for your
[54:32] eternal home.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Are you aware that your eternal home
[54:37] Jesus talked about, I have mansions. I'm
[54:39] gone to prepare mansions. He has gone to
[54:42] prepare a a dwelling place.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. And just like your mother when she
[54:48] was carrying you in the womb, she had
[54:50] certain desires. Or or I could I I have
[54:53] in my notes here, the boy that ate ate
[54:56] the petals on his bicycle because his
[54:59] body was craving sulfur.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Wh what who told him that there was
[55:03] sulfur in the rubber?
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Who told him that? who told him that
[55:08] he's eating the maybe the rubber off the
[55:10] ends of the pencils because of there's a
[55:13] call in the body for sulfur. Let me say
[55:16] this to you. Beyond beyond what that boy
[55:19] knew, beyond what you know, beyond what
[55:22] you understand about yourself, beyond
[55:24] what you think the message is, God has
[55:27] placed a craving within you for
[55:29] realities of God. And you'll never be
[55:32] satisfied until you come to that place.
[55:35] And then it's a relationship that you
[55:38] enter into with the person of the we say
[55:41] the message. The message is a person.
[55:44] It's it's Jesus Christ in his revealing
[55:47] making known himself to you. That's what
[55:50] the message is.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; And when you have a relationship,
[55:56] that kind of a relationship,
[55:59] &gt;&gt; you don't you'll never question it.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Are you born? Of course I'm born. I
[56:05] counseledled with a man on the phone who
[56:08] may be streaming right now way far
[56:11] thousands of miles from here in the
[56:14] United States.
[56:17] He called me.
[56:20] He got a phone number to the office
[56:24] from another person. Turned out to be
[56:26] his mother.
[56:29] And I called him back. I wasn't going
[56:31] to. I didn't have time. And then I
[56:33] thought before I leave the house, I must
[56:35] call this man. So I called him.
[56:39] He said, "Brother Briscoll, I heard your
[56:40] name when I was just a boy. I've heard
[56:43] your name at church."
[56:46] And he said,
[56:49] and he began to relate his life and so
[56:51] on and the things and events that had
[56:53] taken place.
[56:55] And it was sad in one way.
[56:59] And as I begin to speak to him, he's
[57:01] talking about the message and the
[57:02] message. I just stopped him. I said,
[57:03] "The message." People say, "Oh, they're
[57:07] in the message." Or, "I'm in the
[57:08] message." That isn't that isn't even a
[57:10] phrase.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; The message is a person.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; And when you say, "I'm in Christ."
[57:17] That's the only way you That's the only
[57:18] phrase that would even make any sense.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; I'm in Christ.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; We are in Christ. We are in We are in
[57:26] the word and the word is in us. and we
[57:28] have a relationship
[57:30] and and it speaks to me. He speaks to me
[57:33] &gt;&gt; and I have a certain love that wells up
[57:36] in my heart and maybe a tear even come
[57:39] to your eye in your private time and you
[57:41] just you just talk to him and he talks
[57:44] back to you.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; And I spoke to him.
[57:50] He's a minister's son. ministered this
[57:54] message,
[57:55] the minister's son,
[57:58] and it was my privilege to talk to him.
[58:00] I preached to him for about half an
[58:01] hour.
[58:05] See, there's that's one thing that I
[58:07] must want to convey. I know all of these
[58:10] other ministering brethren have conveyed
[58:13] sought to convey to you but I feel it is
[58:16] uh
[58:18] it it's something that needs to be so
[58:22] emphasized that it finally will cut away
[58:26] and perhaps it could cut away some of
[58:28] the you know just relig religiosity or
[58:32] we're going to church and you're in
[58:34] church and it's a Sunday morning and so
[58:36] on. We could get rid of all of that just
[58:39] for a season. So, I'm here to hear some
[58:42] things and I need the Holy Spirit to
[58:45] come upon me and to come into me and
[58:48] open up my eyes. So, I I could have the
[58:51] same many of the questions that the that
[58:53] the apostles had and the disciples had.
[58:56] We have many of the same things, many of
[58:58] the same kind of questions.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; And so, I pray that God will answer some
[59:02] of those.
[59:06] So Jesus said in one scripture, I just
[59:08] like to give you a scenario.
[59:11] Jesus said, "I came not to call the
[59:13] righteous, but sinners to repentance."
[59:16] Amen.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; And uh I have that's not a theme, but I
[59:21] just felt I would like to say that
[59:24] the forerunner John,
[59:28] he certainly
[59:30] his message and the theme of his message
[59:32] was to turn his disciples
[59:35] and let the world know I'm a forerunner.
[59:39] I just I'm forerunning. Well, if he's
[59:41] forerunning somebody, then you want to
[59:43] say who is he forerunning? Who's that
[59:45] person? Right.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; And so then he, you know, he behold the
[59:49] lamb of God. And here's a man walking on
[59:51] the on the pathway and walking into the
[59:54] mud of the Jordan River to be baptized
[59:57] by his cousin.
[1:00:01] As far as the world was concerned, his
[1:00:03] cousin, let me tell you friends, that
[1:00:05] takes revelation
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; to see that that was more than his
[1:00:09] cousin. That was more than just a man.
[1:00:13] That takes revelation. And and and no
[1:00:15] matter how much revelation person had,
[1:00:17] you could never ever grasp. But by him
[1:00:20] were all things made that was made.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Here's the creator of heavens and earth.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; He's the embodiment of the godhead
[1:00:30] bodily.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; How can we grasp that? And we're not
[1:00:34] sitting here today saying, "I have it
[1:00:36] all." Nobody has it all. But we just
[1:00:38] pray, oh God, take this teaspoon full of
[1:00:41] ashes that are in my brain and and
[1:00:44] expand it. Oh God, I can see that.
[1:00:48] That's why the prophet spoke of things
[1:00:49] that that people, even myself, we all
[1:00:53] have read things and say, well, you
[1:00:55] know, I I don't get that. Well, help me
[1:00:58] to get it. Wasn't said for no purpose at
[1:01:01] all. Help us to understand it.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? Amen.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; So to receive is to take with oneself as
[1:01:12] we said earlier to accept or acknowledge
[1:01:15] one that is that uh to accept or
[1:01:20] acknowledge one to be such as he
[1:01:23] professes to be.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; It's
[1:01:27] a lot of people profess to be
[1:01:29] Christians. But have they been received?
[1:01:35] The receiving is when the one unveils
[1:01:38] himself.
[1:01:40] And if he is the word, then it's the
[1:01:42] word that has unveiling. And the
[1:01:44] unveiling cannot just come in a meaning
[1:01:47] like you know uh uh a meaning that we
[1:01:52] comprehend or we understand or have you
[1:01:55] ever seen anybody dress and you might
[1:01:58] say
[1:02:00] don't can take this too personal now but
[1:02:03] somebody dresses say uh well that's
[1:02:06] maybe not your style and you might say
[1:02:09] well I do say to my wife what do they
[1:02:13] think when I put that on in the morning
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; and and and I don't know if you've ever
[1:02:18] said that but if you have and quite a
[1:02:21] few of you are smiling so I think you
[1:02:22] have said that what do they think when
[1:02:25] they do that you know what what do they
[1:02:28] think when they look how can I think
[1:02:29] that just looks so wild
[1:02:33] that looks so terrible what do they
[1:02:36] think when they put it on
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; I wasn't going to say this but I
[1:02:44] There was one of our sisters that was
[1:02:45] sitting down here. I don't want to
[1:02:47] embarrass anybody, but they were sitting
[1:02:50] down here in the wedding yesterday.
[1:02:53] And we had a photographer,
[1:02:56] two photographers, and her flashing
[1:02:58] pictures, etc., etc.
[1:03:06] for you that were at the wedding saw
[1:03:08] this lady and she's taking pictures and
[1:03:11] if she's streaming or she's even here
[1:03:13] that's fine. This is this is not bad.
[1:03:15] But uh one of our sisters walked in and
[1:03:18] was seated
[1:03:20] and uh I was sitting back here
[1:03:24] and I I just observed her
[1:03:28] and she become focused on this sister
[1:03:32] and she just studied it. while you study
[1:03:35] it. I was watching her study. I thought,
[1:03:38] "No, that is more than for a picture.
[1:03:41] She respected she didn't take a picture.
[1:03:44] She just studied it." And and I knew
[1:03:47] that she was being convicted in her
[1:03:50] heart
[1:03:52] when she saw the way the sister was
[1:03:53] dressed.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; And then she she looked up and she was,
[1:03:57] you know, like she was studying what was
[1:03:59] happening, etc., etc., but it was just
[1:04:01] like a magnet. Then she turned right
[1:04:03] back down, looked at the sister again.
[1:04:07] Then she looked up again the second or
[1:04:09] third time. And then she looked right
[1:04:10] back. And every time she looked, it was
[1:04:13] a it was a special look. She just
[1:04:16] looking. Then she began to after about
[1:04:19] three, four times, she began to kind of
[1:04:21] adjust her own garments
[1:04:24] uh just to be covered a little bit
[1:04:26] better. And uh before brother Tom got up
[1:04:30] here and preached a message, that sister
[1:04:32] had already preached a message. But she
[1:04:35] didn't know she was preaching a message.
[1:04:37] She wasn't trying to preach. She wasn't
[1:04:38] saying any words. But I know that that
[1:04:41] woman was spoke to profoundly
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; at the wedding service.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; And this is the kind of thing that
[1:04:47] there's there's a call within people.
[1:04:50] There's a call within the individual
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; to be
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; to be what we are. Amen.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not because we have a bunch
[1:04:58] of doctrines and we have to live by.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; It's not that.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; If you think that then you really need
[1:05:04] this service.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; We don't live the way we live or we
[1:05:10] don't live by a certain code or dress
[1:05:13] code or whatever more. It's something
[1:05:15] that a person desires.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; You desire it. You desire a certain
[1:05:21] life.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; You want to be pleasing to him.
[1:05:27] Amen.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; I'm going to turn a corner in a few
[1:05:33] moments here. So, I want you to really
[1:05:34] hang on, please. In the things that are
[1:05:38] to be
[1:05:40] I'm going to give this same uh same
[1:05:43] quote back again, please. Now, he was
[1:05:46] telling them
[1:05:48] Jesus was telling them that after death
[1:05:52] there is a life. So he was speaking
[1:05:54] about another life. Let's not think
[1:05:56] about death so much. We think about
[1:05:58] another life. And because I go, he
[1:06:02] wasn't going into the details of his
[1:06:04] suffering and the and Calvary and all
[1:06:06] the in in deep doctrine. I'm going to
[1:06:09] save the world and take the sins of the
[1:06:11] world. He could have been saying so
[1:06:13] much, but to his disciples, he's
[1:06:15] emphasizing a certain something that
[1:06:17] there's a a life after this life. And
[1:06:20] I'm going now to prepare a place. He
[1:06:22] wasn't talking about the the horrible
[1:06:24] agony of his going.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; He could have been saying so much about
[1:06:28] the suffering,
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; about the blood, and about all the
[1:06:31] things. He could have been saying
[1:06:33] volumes about that. But he says nothing
[1:06:35] about that. He just saying simply, I'm
[1:06:38] going
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; and the purpose is to prepare a place
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; for you. And now a prophet he comes and
[1:06:47] he in in in in speaking about
[1:06:51] uh preparing a place to describe that he
[1:06:54] talks about you and me
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; before we came when we were in a place
[1:07:00] before we were ushered into the world.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; This gets deep friends. It's fine. He
[1:07:07] talks about God before God began his
[1:07:10] creation. He removed the water off the
[1:07:12] face of the earth. And then the power of
[1:07:15] his word be to take place. And he said
[1:07:17] like you when the water was moved
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; in the womb of your mother
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; and you were issued into this world,
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; there was already a a body for you.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; You took your breath.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; And the spirit was there to receive to
[1:07:34] receive you. And you were there to
[1:07:36] receive it. Amen.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; And if you didn't receive it, you had a
[1:07:39] stillborn
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; five fingers here, five there, five
[1:07:44] toes, five toes, perfect maybe
[1:07:47] conception, maybe a perfect time of of
[1:07:49] of the of the pregnancy while a child
[1:07:52] was being everything was formed. The
[1:07:54] mother ate the right things and you had
[1:07:56] a healthy body. But if that spirit
[1:07:59] didn't receive you
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; and you receive it, it was a stillborn
[1:08:04] and no one would ever know was it a
[1:08:06] gifted child, was it a a certain kind of
[1:08:09] a child, was it an aggressive child, was
[1:08:11] it a passive child? We wouldn't know
[1:08:14] because there's no spirit to be animated
[1:08:16] by that body.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; And friends, we're saying something
[1:08:20] more.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Church and the gospel is more than just
[1:08:23] a book called a Bible. Amen.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Church and the gospel of Jesus Christ is
[1:08:29] more than just coming to church on
[1:08:31] Sunday. More than hearing sermons or
[1:08:34] hearing specials or singing songs, more
[1:08:37] than a formality. If we miss the person
[1:08:40] of the gospel, we've missed absolutely
[1:08:42] everything.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; He is a person. And you want to say in
[1:08:48] this service, oh Lord God,
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; come make yourself personally known to
[1:08:54] me.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; More than coming to church
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; because I go to prepare a place. I go to
[1:09:10] prepare a place that is
[1:09:13] receive you.
[1:09:16] Apostle Paul talks about the scattering
[1:09:19] of Israel, which I may get to a little
[1:09:21] later, and the gathering and the
[1:09:23] gathering of them. I just want to drop
[1:09:25] this in.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Are you listening? Close.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; I asked God to give you, this isn't
[1:09:31] deep. This is very superficial, but it's
[1:09:34] very profound.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; At the same time in history, you know, I
[1:09:38] said earlier, you have to be able to
[1:09:39] take the types.
[1:09:41] All right? Jesus was saying to his
[1:09:43] disciples, don't go to the don't go to
[1:09:47] the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
[1:09:49] Don't go to the other places and take
[1:09:52] nothing with you. And then the next time
[1:09:53] he said, if you have a coat, take two or
[1:09:57] and take a sword and take the money and
[1:10:00] take your script and don't take all
[1:10:01] these things. It was a different kind of
[1:10:03] instruction a little later on. And now
[1:10:06] at this time
[1:10:08] here the and this is an era that we
[1:10:11] happen to live in. I happen to live in
[1:10:13] as brother Bram talks about the
[1:10:14] restoration of the gifts and all that.
[1:10:16] We saw all of that. We witnessed all of
[1:10:19] that. It was incredible. Absolutely
[1:10:22] incredible. And and you can't, you know,
[1:10:25] you can't replay it. It's not something
[1:10:27] you just replay like a tape. But we saw
[1:10:30] all that and then just because God was
[1:10:33] making ready a kind of an atmosphere for
[1:10:36] a birth and then the message comes.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; And all kinds of other voices come.
[1:10:41] Brother Bram talked about Velmer
[1:10:43] Gardner. There's WV Grant and Oel
[1:10:45] Jaggers and AA Allen and Tommy Osburn
[1:10:48] and Tommy Hicks and and uh and uh and
[1:10:52] Billy Graham and all of this is sweeping
[1:10:54] over the earth. And in the midst of it
[1:10:56] comes uh a voice. It was a different
[1:10:59] kind of a voice
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; because they would come to the platform
[1:11:03] and say this gentleman would say good
[1:11:05] evening friends
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; good morning friends
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; and then a little while say you know I
[1:11:13] can't do anything
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; until he comes
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; and then when he would come there was
[1:11:19] like a holy hush would come upon the
[1:11:21] people. Sydney Jackson told me when
[1:11:23] there was hundreds of thousands of
[1:11:24] people in South Africa, he said when he
[1:11:27] would come to the platform and when he
[1:11:29] would say he's here, he said like a hush
[1:11:31] fell over. He said even the dogs, he
[1:11:34] said at most gatherings dogs are
[1:11:36] fighting and animals are running
[1:11:38] through. He said even dogs are not
[1:11:40] barking. There's no disturbance like
[1:11:43] something holy fell over the
[1:11:45] congregation. Yes.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; And he said when brother Brandham prayed
[1:11:49] the last prayer, he says for several
[1:11:51] hours. And brother Cindy Jackson was
[1:11:53] there participated and he said for
[1:11:56] several hours supernatural things were
[1:11:58] taking place. He and and these things
[1:12:00] might move us but it wasn't it wasn't
[1:12:02] it. What it really was is that the Lord
[1:12:05] Jesus Christ was making himself known,
[1:12:07] doing the same thing, doing the same
[1:12:09] kind of signs and wonders. But that
[1:12:11] wasn't it. It was far more than that. It
[1:12:13] was when the word finally came, did the
[1:12:16] people digest? Did the people have the
[1:12:19] people entered into a relationship with
[1:12:21] the one who was doing the miracles?
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:30] And he goes on to talk about this body.
[1:12:32] When this body dropped here into the
[1:12:34] earth like the baby is dropped, also
[1:12:37] there is a an immortal body. Also there
[1:12:40] is an immortal body. Hello. Also, there
[1:12:43] is an immortal body. There is an
[1:12:46] immortal body
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; waiting to receive the spirit back into
[1:12:51] itself again.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Do you understand all that? I don't
[1:12:55] understand all of that, but here we have
[1:12:56] it. Oh, what a great thing we are in
[1:12:59] Christ Jesus.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; We are now. He said, in Christ Jesus.
[1:13:04] Can you make that profession so that he
[1:13:07] will receive you as you profess to be?
[1:13:11] We are now in Christ Jesus. I may not
[1:13:15] understand the depths of it, but we are
[1:13:17] now. I personally am now in Christ
[1:13:20] Jesus. Somebody calls him a message. I
[1:13:23] call him Christ Jesus.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Uh I am in him.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; I'm united to him. I'm married to him.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a great thing.
[1:13:39] Babes in Christ, children of God,
[1:13:42] waiting for the full deliverance at the
[1:13:44] coming of our Lord Jesus to receive us
[1:13:47] up into himself when the body, this
[1:13:52] mortal will take on immortality.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; And then I'm just taking one line out of
[1:13:58] another paragraph, paragraph 62.
[1:14:02] He talks about this place. He said,
[1:14:04] "This is a pest house."
[1:14:06] You don't think it's a pest house?
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; They had a shooting here in Cloverdale
[1:14:10] late this last week. They had a shooting
[1:14:12] in in uh White Rock last night. They had
[1:14:17] four Marines shot and the fifth one has
[1:14:19] just died down there. Well, we said,
[1:14:22] "Well, that's because of communication.
[1:14:24] We hear all these things." Well, it's a
[1:14:26] whole lot more than that. They're just
[1:14:28] horrible violence. The earth, I feel, is
[1:14:30] convulsing under
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; the violence of the world. And the
[1:14:35] scripture says, "As it was,
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; as it was,"
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus saying, "Like it was, so will it
[1:14:41] be."
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; So now, as it was,
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; and I looked at that phrase all through
[1:14:47] the scripture, and there's many places.
[1:14:49] And we really need to say, "As it was,
[1:14:51] so is it." As it was in the life and
[1:14:54] ministry of so of Jesus Christ. So is it
[1:14:57] now? These things are happening. you you
[1:14:59] you you'll finally say to yourself,
[1:15:01] "It's a whole lot more than me just
[1:15:03] getting ready to preach. It's a whole
[1:15:05] lot more than me just going down to
[1:15:07] church."
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; And and the and the people listening,
[1:15:10] it's a whole lot more than me just going
[1:15:12] into church and sitting down. Speak to
[1:15:15] me, oh God.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; And I've asked him to do that this
[1:15:20] morning.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Or today.
[1:15:24] And the and he said this,
[1:15:27] "Oh, but the other one." He was talking
[1:15:29] about this place being a pest house. But
[1:15:32] oh, the other one. How many know what a
[1:15:34] pest house is?
[1:15:38] Eight or 10. How many know what a pest
[1:15:39] house is?
[1:15:43] Yes.
[1:15:45] A pest house.
[1:15:47] When I was a kid
[1:15:50] and you had diptheria
[1:15:52] or some of the diseases you don't even
[1:15:54] know about, they would take a piece of
[1:15:57] paper and nail it to the door.
[1:16:01] Stick it to the door. That this was
[1:16:03] quarantined. This house is quarantined
[1:16:07] because the people who are in there are
[1:16:09] sick. The people who are in there have a
[1:16:12] a communicable disease and you must not
[1:16:16] go in there. this is a pest house.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; They didn't say it was a pest house, but
[1:16:22] they would say it's quarantined. You're
[1:16:24] not allowed to go in there.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; That was on the houses. Now, uh you'll
[1:16:29] go into a you'll go into a
[1:16:34] hospital and they'll say you're not
[1:16:36] allowed to go in there.
[1:16:38] I don't know if Jim Pritchard is here,
[1:16:40] but you know know him as David Daniels.
[1:16:44] He sits so out in the front out in the
[1:16:48] shop out in the fellowship room much of
[1:16:51] the time, but I was in the hospital a
[1:16:55] few months ago. They never expect him to
[1:16:58] live and they just about wouldn't let me
[1:17:01] in there. And I had a whole team of
[1:17:04] people just serving him.
[1:17:08] and one person who was his personal male
[1:17:12] nurse as one of the large hospitals
[1:17:14] downtown.
[1:17:16] And they were they were hesitant to let
[1:17:19] me go in. Well, you've got a scrub. I
[1:17:22] said, "Okay." So, I had to scrub
[1:17:26] gown
[1:17:28] and a mask
[1:17:31] to go in there because of the disease.
[1:17:33] Do you know why?
[1:17:36] This world is a pest house.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; It's a pest house.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of things floating
[1:17:44] around.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; It's floating on the internet.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; It's a floating They're they're contam
[1:17:50] they're contemptable things
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; and they're they're contaminating things
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; and they'll contaminate in your soul
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; and your mind and corrupt it. Yes.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; You know that's true.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; And what are we preaching for? That we
[1:18:09] be free from that. We're not preaching
[1:18:11] some social gospel. The social gospel
[1:18:13] will never do it.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; The sharpness of the two-edged sword
[1:18:17] must come and separate us from that and
[1:18:20] say, "Oh, God, thank you."
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Richard Drake's daddy was the
[1:18:26] deacon in our church before he passed
[1:18:29] away. And his testimony was, "When I
[1:18:32] heard the message," he said, "It just
[1:18:34] took the height off my back, but I loved
[1:18:37] it."
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Takes the height off our back,
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; but we love it.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Do you love it?
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; So, he talked about a past house. Excuse
[1:18:52] me for taking my time. He said, "The
[1:18:54] other one is called my father's house."
[1:18:59] He said, "I'll go and prepare a place
[1:19:01] for you.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Take you out of this pest house
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; and deliver you into my father's house."
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; That's what the message is all about.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; That's what the message is. The message
[1:19:14] is the person of Jesus Christ receiving
[1:19:17] you unto himself. That the purpose of it
[1:19:21] is that where he is, where I am, he said
[1:19:24] you might be there also. How are you
[1:19:27] going to get there? By receiving him.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; That's the only way you can be there.
[1:19:33] And he has to receive you. And I'm
[1:19:35] trying to convey to you today the coming
[1:19:38] of the message in whatever form it
[1:19:40] comes. Say, "Well, I don't really care
[1:19:42] for that minister. He, you know, he he
[1:19:45] talks too quiet or he talks too fast or
[1:19:47] he he does this or he does that."
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; But what if it's
[1:19:55] Christ?
[1:19:56] himself
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; seeking to receive you a certain way.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; And you have to wade through some,
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; as I said to the young couple just
[1:20:07] yesterday before we prayed, it's not
[1:20:09] always those that you admire
[1:20:12] that God is going to have. You know what
[1:20:15] an impress impressed is? Now, I'll just
[1:20:17] enlarge on it a wee bit. To impress
[1:20:20] somebody is to to take on an image by a
[1:20:24] blow.
[1:20:26] It's not, you know, velvet gloves sort
[1:20:29] of thing. Handle people real nice and do
[1:20:32] you want to be happy and do you want to
[1:20:33] be That's not the gospel of Jesus
[1:20:36] Christ. Are you ready to repent?
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Turn from your sin.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Be separated from the world.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; That's what God calls for.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well,
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; so I said, I'll go and prepare and I'll
[1:20:52] take you out of this pest out and
[1:20:54] deliver you into my father's house.
[1:20:55] Amen. There you are. Take you out of
[1:20:58] this earthly pest house. He's gone to
[1:21:00] prepare a place. Some of the last words
[1:21:02] of the messenger, a perfect place where
[1:21:05] no evil exists, no sickness exists, no
[1:21:08] old age exists, no death exists.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Only if you understand that can you
[1:21:14] understand why he says that civilization
[1:21:17] is of the devil. Because you have to add
[1:21:19] another phrase because it came by sex.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; We are all here by an earthly birth and
[1:21:26] by that earthly birth we die. But
[1:21:29] there's another birth that we live.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; There's another birth that takes us from
[1:21:34] this pest house
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; and we're not a part of the pest house.
[1:21:38] We're not a part of the system. Don't
[1:21:40] become enamored with whether it be
[1:21:43] education or whether it be this
[1:21:45] civilization what it provides for you.
[1:21:48] the shiny cars or boats or nice homes or
[1:21:51] whatever more. It's fine. We have to
[1:21:53] have it. But that's not our life. It's
[1:21:56] part of the pest house.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; And he's going to deliver us from it.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; He said it'll be another civilization so
[1:22:09] far beyond this,
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; so far beyond it that it can't even
[1:22:14] hardly come into our minds. Are you with
[1:22:16] me?
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; So, we have to have it. We have to we
[1:22:22] have to have our education. We have to
[1:22:25] have our jobs. We have to do all of
[1:22:28] these natural things, pay our bills,
[1:22:30] etc., etc. But it's not our life. That's
[1:22:33] not what we make our life out of.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; You think God's going to call you, not
[1:22:40] see you through, he's going to see you
[1:22:42] through somehow, some way.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; And he says this, this is the phrase,
[1:22:51] it's a perfect place calling you to that
[1:22:56] perfection.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; I was saying just a little bit earlier,
[1:23:01] please just be alert for a moment.
[1:23:05] when when the prophet's ministry broke
[1:23:08] on the scene,
[1:23:10] somehow the Jews, natural Jews from all
[1:23:15] over Europe, and I have many, many
[1:23:18] scriptures where God says, "I will
[1:23:20] scatter you and I'll scatter you into
[1:23:22] all the nations. I'll scatter you." And
[1:23:25] then I have other scriptures that have
[1:23:26] it here, and I'll gather you. I'll
[1:23:28] gather you out of all the nations. Isn't
[1:23:31] it amazing that he scattered him for
[1:23:33] decades? Hundreds of years he scattered
[1:23:36] them. And isn't it amazing that right at
[1:23:39] the time that a messenger has come here
[1:23:41] to gather a bride for Jesus Christ that
[1:23:45] Jesus reveals himself. And isn't it
[1:23:48] amazing that God begins to call the
[1:23:51] people. I even talked to a Jew. I talked
[1:23:53] to one who's a who was the originator of
[1:23:57] a a kibbutz in Israel. And I said, "How
[1:24:01] is it that you came?" Well, he said,
[1:24:03] 'You know, it's a He said it was it was
[1:24:07] kind of strange. He couldn't explain it.
[1:24:08] He said, I'm the eldest of four sons,
[1:24:12] and I I would as being the eldest, he
[1:24:14] says I would fall heir to our business,
[1:24:18] and my father had a tailoring business,
[1:24:21] a very successful business in Austria.
[1:24:25] But he said something came over me.
[1:24:28] Something came over me, and I felt I I
[1:24:30] have to return to Israel. There was no
[1:24:33] Israel. There was no state. This was
[1:24:35] 1939.
[1:24:37] And he missed the first world, the
[1:24:38] Second World War. He missed the
[1:24:40] Holocaust. He missed everything. And he
[1:24:43] realizes that that God, my family was
[1:24:46] there. My children were there. And I was
[1:24:49] talking to him about the kibuts and the
[1:24:51] economics of the kibuts. And and he
[1:24:54] said, "You see these cows?" He said, "We
[1:24:56] get the dairy cows from the
[1:24:57] Netherlands." He said, "But here they
[1:25:00] give 30% more milk than they do there."
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; What happened? We don't know what
[1:25:07] happened. Even a cow answered the call.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "See our see our cotton that we
[1:25:17] grow." He said it they this the same
[1:25:20] cotton they grow in Egypt just over
[1:25:22] here. He said we get double the
[1:25:24] production what they get there.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Think of it. What is it? God said he's
[1:25:30] going to prosper. Even the soil is
[1:25:32] answering
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; to the creator.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; And the same time God begins to gather
[1:25:40] them back. He sends a messenger to the
[1:25:42] Gentiles to gather us back to himself.
[1:25:46] Oh, I think that's so wonderful. Can't
[1:25:49] we say thank you, Lord Jesus?
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; At the same time, we say that's an
[1:25:56] accident. That's a big accident.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; That's a wonderful accident.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; That goes far beyond any doubt I ever
[1:26:03] had.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; I'll gather them back. And it's the
[1:26:07] power of that word. Now,
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; what is it in? His name was Kaman. What
[1:26:15] was it in Kaman? He said something. I
[1:26:19] just began to have such a desire. I had
[1:26:22] to return to Israel. There was no
[1:26:24] Israel. There was no state. All it was
[1:26:26] was desert and rocks and and he became
[1:26:32] the originator, one of two men that
[1:26:34] originated kaboots
[1:26:36] where we were.
[1:26:39] We stayed there, stayed nearby.
[1:26:44] I saw the children went through the
[1:26:45] school, went through the places where
[1:26:47] they had the children
[1:26:50] living.
[1:26:52] And I've thought about that multitude of
[1:26:54] times.
[1:26:56] What caused him?
[1:26:59] And I met others.
[1:27:02] What was in it? What kind of a call did
[1:27:04] they hear?
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Now I'm coming down to my message. What
[1:27:10] kind of a call do you hear
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; the first time?
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I I wasn't even trying.
[1:27:17] Somebody handed me a book or somebody
[1:27:19] handed me a tape or
[1:27:22] or like I heard this voice.
[1:27:25] But what was it in you
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; that kept nibbling?
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; What was it in you that kept wanting to
[1:27:31] hear more?
[1:27:35] You had a place,
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; God's house,
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; calling you to it.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Did he stop? No. Then you came to
[1:27:45] church. Then you began to hear about it
[1:27:51] and the call even maybe became even more
[1:27:55] distinct
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; and you went through rough waters.
[1:27:59] That's good. You had to make tough
[1:28:02] decisions. That's good.
[1:28:06] Jesus did too.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; The disciples did also.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:11] You know, while I was there, there was
[1:28:12] steps like this in Israel on the
[1:28:17] on the uh
[1:28:20] right to the wall of the old city.
[1:28:23] They're just outside the wall.
[1:28:26] And the guide was taking us and
[1:28:29] and said, "Now here on these steps, Gale
[1:28:34] would take his
[1:28:36] students and teach them here." And
[1:28:39] Apostle Paul was a student of Galo,
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; And I thought maybe Apostle Paul sat
[1:28:46] right on these steps.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; And Jesus walking all through Jerusalem
[1:28:51] and and he knew he was there.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; He knew he was getting stuffed with
[1:28:56] religion.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; He knew he was getting stuffed with the
[1:28:58] law and becoming a scholar of the law.
[1:29:02] But Jesus knew, I'll reveal myself to
[1:29:04] him. And as I said to the young couple
[1:29:07] just in a few words I I gave yesterday
[1:29:09] at the reception. It it was a
[1:29:13] he was one that was so articulate with
[1:29:16] the law. He knew it inside out. He said
[1:29:19] everything that he knew he counted as
[1:29:21] loss. He counted as dross that he might
[1:29:24] win Christ.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; And Christ was the Christ wasn't against
[1:29:28] the law. He was the fulfillment of the
[1:29:31] law. So he was saying I I I gave all
[1:29:34] that learning and that intelligence and
[1:29:36] that intellect up. Jesus could have
[1:29:39] called him.
[1:29:41] Jesus could have called him then with
[1:29:42] his own vocal cords.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; But rather than call him with his vocal
[1:29:47] cords. He called him by a a a heavenly
[1:29:50] calling.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; And he was smitten to the ground. The
[1:29:54] others weren't smitten.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; He was smitten. and he was going he had
[1:29:58] letters in his possession to take
[1:30:01] Christians that were following Christ
[1:30:03] into uh in in in imprisoned them.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine friends Cloverdale Bible
[1:30:10] Way and all those that may be streaming
[1:30:12] this service how absurd that may be by
[1:30:15] today's standards.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; This person's an enemy of Christ. And
[1:30:20] here God takes and he he falls to the
[1:30:23] ground and he cries out this man with
[1:30:26] all the answers
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; run into a presence he didn't have an
[1:30:30] answer for.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Who art thou Lord?
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; I'm Jesus.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Why? Why do you kick against the pricks?
[1:30:42] I'm Jesus.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Why do you resist this?
[1:30:48] When did God begin to cut to the others?
[1:30:51] To the others, he saw some fishing. He
[1:30:52] said, "Follow me." That's what they
[1:30:54] heard.
[1:30:56] Now, I'm I'm I'm casting a net out to
[1:30:59] the congregation.
[1:31:01] I want I want to ask you seriously,
[1:31:05] what was that that they heard? Did they
[1:31:07] just hear, "Follow me. I'll make you
[1:31:09] fishers of men." Is is that what made
[1:31:12] them give everything up and give leave
[1:31:14] their father tending their net and leave
[1:31:17] family and leave all the ties that were
[1:31:19] precious to them? What was that?
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; What is that in a person? What is that
[1:31:25] in you?
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:31:34] I can go back. I was your age. I was
[1:31:37] your age. I was your age. I was your
[1:31:40] age.
[1:31:42] My wife was the age of you girls.
[1:31:45] And I had to ask myself, this isn't this
[1:31:48] isn't a new teaching. This is an old
[1:31:50] gospel and it's still brand new and it's
[1:31:53] new for all of us.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; What is it that calls a person?
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, uh, I can't really explain
[1:32:03] it." I can't either.
[1:32:06] Do you have it?
[1:32:09] Is there something in there? I'm going
[1:32:11] to appeal to it this morning.
[1:32:15] H
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; how long are we expecting it, you know,
[1:32:18] to wind all up in a rapture and all the
[1:32:21] rest of it? But we we need to realize
[1:32:24] that the preaching of the message, the
[1:32:27] preaching of Christ is actually him
[1:32:30] receiving you.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. from meeting to meeting,
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; from messenger to messenger, from
[1:32:36] preacher to preacher is appealing to
[1:32:39] something that's within you. And if you
[1:32:41] look back and say, "Oh, that was a good
[1:32:43] message." That's not the point.
[1:32:45] [Applause]
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Calling
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; and the miracle is you have something to
[1:32:52] respond to it that responds.
[1:32:58] As I thought about this, now I'll take
[1:33:01] you through the curve that I had to go
[1:33:03] through.
[1:33:05] What kept coming to me was the prodal
[1:33:07] son and the two sons.
[1:33:10] The two sons. And a certain man had two
[1:33:13] sons.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; And the one said, "Give me all the
[1:33:17] substance that be that befalls to me."
[1:33:20] And he went and took his into another
[1:33:22] country and and spent all of his
[1:33:24] substance with riotous living. And one
[1:33:27] says with harlotry and so on so forth. I
[1:33:30] don't want to bother your mind but with
[1:33:32] righteous living and after he'd spent
[1:33:34] all he became
[1:33:36] he took a took work
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; and he was feeding the swine and you
[1:33:41] know the story and he fain would have
[1:33:44] filled his belly with the husks of the
[1:33:46] swine
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; and and I don't know how it happens. I
[1:33:53] don't know what happened but he came to
[1:33:55] himself Right?
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Thought, "Hey, wait a minute.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; My father's got servants. They got food.
[1:34:03] And here I'm trying to eat this old hust
[1:34:04] that I feed the pigs.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Uh, I'll return to my father."
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; That was the grace of God to heal.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Just him coming to himself.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; And there might be somebody here and no
[1:34:20] doubt is or on the internet. And I
[1:34:23] thought while I was studying, I'll just
[1:34:25] say to you brothers, you know what it is
[1:34:27] like and God will speak to you. God
[1:34:30] spoke to me and says you'll speak to
[1:34:32] somebody on the internet today.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; So I'm calling someone on the internet
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; that is streaming the service.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; And do you know that God is calling you?
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; And maybe you're just waking up and
[1:34:46] saying, "I'll return.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; I'll go back to father's house.
[1:34:51] You don't even know where Father's house
[1:34:53] is, but he went to prepare a place in
[1:34:56] Father's house.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; He's calling you from the pest house
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; to Father's house.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; And sent a prophet to call you and let
[1:35:06] you know in his last words,
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; there's a life beyond this life.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; This is a pest house. At its best, it's
[1:35:13] a pest house.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; And one thing is certain. If time goes
[1:35:19] on, you're going to die like every man
[1:35:21] dies. Like every dog dies, like every
[1:35:24] animal dies. Man will die. Woman will
[1:35:27] die.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Preach it.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; He's talking about another life. And
[1:35:32] that life isn't didn't come by sex. That
[1:35:34] life came by the word of God.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; And the word that he spoke was the words
[1:35:39] of eternal life.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; In him was life. Not this life. In him
[1:35:45] was life. and the life was the light of
[1:35:47] menise.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; How marvelous it is for one at the
[1:35:55] stature of Apostle Paul
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; to write, as I said to the young couple
[1:35:59] yesterday, a letter from prison. I
[1:36:02] thought I would start with that. 19
[1:36:04] words from prison. Brethren, follow be
[1:36:08] be followers of me
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; and those and mark those that do so
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; as as I do or as we do.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Mark them. That's that's good for you.
[1:36:20] All of you young men, young ladies
[1:36:22] especially. Mark them that are godly.
[1:36:26] Mark them that are feeders of the word.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Talk to them. Make friends of them.
[1:36:32] Amen.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Be in that kind of a home and that kind
[1:36:35] of an atmosphere of people that are sold
[1:36:38] out unreservedly to the message which is
[1:36:41] Christ.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; So this man,
[1:36:51] this son said, I I'll I'll return. I'll
[1:36:54] go to my father's house.
[1:36:57] His servants are treated better than
[1:36:58] this.
[1:37:01] And now I'm talking about receiving
[1:37:03] them.
[1:37:06] People say, "Well, I was saved and we
[1:37:08] think that that's when we were
[1:37:09] received." No, the receiving is the
[1:37:11] whole process. The Jews coming back to
[1:37:14] Israel was over many, many years. And
[1:37:17] they were answering a call. They did
[1:37:18] they couldn't define the call and they
[1:37:20] couldn't define what was in them. And we
[1:37:23] all experienced that as believers, as
[1:37:25] Christians. I became a believer then or
[1:37:28] he revealed himself to me. That's not
[1:37:30] the end all. That's the beginning of a
[1:37:32] new life.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; But here this morning, here today,
[1:37:37] I know because the Holy Spirit witnessed
[1:37:39] to me,
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; there would be those here, maybe
[1:37:42] visitors, maybe those that have been
[1:37:44] here for years, but within is a hunger.
[1:37:48] And I say God is appealing to that
[1:37:50] hunger.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; And God is making moves. And God is
[1:37:56] giving messages. And God is opening his
[1:37:59] word for one purpose that it might come
[1:38:02] to the people to uh to create that
[1:38:05] appetite or to satisfy that appetite and
[1:38:08] know that
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; he's receiving you.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says
[1:38:15] while the son was returning back and he
[1:38:17] was a a great far off
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; great distance away
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; the father saw him.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:28] I'm speaking to this congregation. I'm
[1:38:31] speaking to every soul that'll ever hear
[1:38:33] this message. And the father even saw
[1:38:36] you when maybe you were a long ways
[1:38:38] away. And there might be somebody who's
[1:38:40] a long ways away. And to those of you
[1:38:43] that may be uh faithful, solid
[1:38:46] believers, I want to say to you, there
[1:38:48] are times when he leaves the 90 and nine
[1:38:51] to go after one. Yes,
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; there might be somebody that's after the
[1:38:55] one
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; that the that the Lord Jesus, the great
[1:38:58] shepherd, is after the one. Or there are
[1:39:00] times when we as believers feel very
[1:39:03] very distant.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; I want you to know the father sees you.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; And the father just didn't look through
[1:39:11] a pair of binoculars and see him a far
[1:39:13] off. When he saw him, he got up and the
[1:39:16] Bible says he ran. The father ran. God
[1:39:20] running.
[1:39:23] to the son because it was his son.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; It was bone of his bone and flesh of his
[1:39:31] flesh
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; and he ran to him. People sit in church
[1:39:35] and don't realize that God is looking to
[1:39:38] see a person maybe a far off.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; He doesn't care what you've been
[1:39:44] through.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; You just make a move and he'll run
[1:39:48] toward you.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He was receiving him
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; and he embraced him
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; and kissed him.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; He was receiving him.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; But that wasn't the end of it.
[1:40:04] There was a robe hanging in the closet.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; His robe.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; That would be part of the receiving.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; That wasn't all. He had a ring for him.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; And he has he that running for you has a
[1:40:17] ring for you. It's unmmerited favor.
[1:40:20] There's nothing that you can do, nothing
[1:40:22] you can do, young people. It's no good
[1:40:24] that we can and nothing good that you
[1:40:26] can do. He has a ring for you.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; You may be, you may be a believer, born
[1:40:33] again and all the rest of it, but
[1:40:35] perhaps you haven't had the ring slipped
[1:40:37] on your finger yet. The ring of
[1:40:39] unmarited grace,
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; the ring of the wedding ring.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; And besides that, he was still being
[1:40:48] received. Besides the robe and besides
[1:40:51] the ring, there was a calf in this
[1:40:53] stall.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; The fatted calf.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; The lovely calf. The treasure of the
[1:41:00] family. He said, "Go and kill a fatted
[1:41:03] calf. My son that was lost has come home
[1:41:07] again."
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; All of this was part of the receiving.
[1:41:12] Yes.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; And I think when I hear I hear hear the
[1:41:18] prophet of God.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; He said,
[1:41:23] I'll read it for you
[1:41:27] in prayer. He says, "Almighty God, the
[1:41:30] author of this book through Jesus
[1:41:33] Christ, we pray. We're thankful for what
[1:41:36] we've already heard tonight. Yes,
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; if we should punctuate this meeting by
[1:41:42] saying amen and go home. It was good to
[1:41:45] be here.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; For we know that of this word that we
[1:41:50] might know the hour that we're that
[1:41:53] we're living.
[1:41:56] That's why we're here. That you might
[1:41:58] know the hour that we're living in.
[1:42:04] If we know the hour we're living, then
[1:42:08] we can prepare for that hour.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; But if we go in blindly, not knowing
[1:42:13] what we what or where, he said, then we
[1:42:17] don't know how to prepare. So, Father,
[1:42:19] we pray that you let us see the ark
[1:42:23] there.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:26] I wonder how many even this morning
[1:42:29] you see more than brothers and sisters,
[1:42:31] more than just someone preaching,
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; more than just a service, but you see
[1:42:35] the ark there.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; He's talking about a different kind of
[1:42:38] sight. I pray, oh God,
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; wipe the world away
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; and clear our eyes sight
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; and let us see the ark there. And not
[1:42:48] only the ark, he said the open door, the
[1:42:51] door open
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; and the message calling.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; May you see and may you hear and may you
[1:42:59] be moved. May you see the ark there and
[1:43:03] the open door.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Who's he referring to? He's going all
[1:43:06] the way back to Noah. But this now was
[1:43:08] as it was in the days of Noah
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; at the same time. May they see the ark.
[1:43:14] May we see the ark there? who's the
[1:43:16] person of Jesus Christ and the open door
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; and the message calling.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; I'm so burdened.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I can finish this
[1:43:40] service
[1:43:42] because God spoke to me. There are
[1:43:44] people that are going to fit fall into
[1:43:47] these categories.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody's been a far away. Yeah.
[1:43:55] You you know all about father's house
[1:43:57] and yeah you know about the servants and
[1:43:59] you know about
[1:44:01] you have a a knowledge of all of these
[1:44:03] things
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; but you just been carrying on
[1:44:08] being battered back and forth by the
[1:44:11] world
[1:44:14] and yet you know well and maybe you put
[1:44:17] father's house
[1:44:20] like the prophet said after death
[1:44:23] but maybe it's a lot closer Did you
[1:44:25] think?
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; And maybe you've been one who said,
[1:44:32] "I'll return. I'm going to return."
[1:44:35] Maybe you're one that has made that
[1:44:37] decision
[1:44:38] some time ago.
[1:44:41] Maybe you've made that decision and but
[1:44:44] it it never occurred to you that the
[1:44:46] father's running,
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; God
[1:44:50] running
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; to you. This is a a son Yes.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; He deserves a robe.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; He deserves a rain.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; He deserves a feast.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be the others. We don't
[1:45:04] want to be the other son. All he knows
[1:45:07] is to do is to work and sweat. I worked
[1:45:10] through the heat of the day. I've never
[1:45:13] never ever done anything wrong. I
[1:45:16] haven't violated my father's word. I've
[1:45:18] just stayed and I've been to church all
[1:45:20] the time and I gave my tithe and I just
[1:45:23] keep going. But I forgot how to rejoice.
[1:45:26] I forgot how to be happy. I forgot how
[1:45:28] to dance. I forgot how to be merry. I
[1:45:31] forgot how to I forgot all about my
[1:45:33] brother. In fact is I'm upset that he's
[1:45:36] having a big feast and and the people
[1:45:39] and all the neighbors are in rejoicing.
[1:45:41] And the father shows his his character
[1:45:44] and he comes out and says, "Son, son,
[1:45:47] it's meat for us. This is the right
[1:45:50] thing for us to be happy now for my our
[1:45:54] my son that was gone, that was dead, is
[1:45:57] now alive again.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; It's made for us that we should rejoice.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; And the son says, "I've never I've never
[1:46:09] contravened. I've never violated any of
[1:46:11] your laws. I've always been a good boy.
[1:46:13] I've I've worked I've gone to the fields
[1:46:16] and I've worked in the heat of the day
[1:46:18] and I I've just been faithful. And he
[1:46:21] said, "All that I have is yours.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; You can go anytime and have a feast.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; You can have the calf anytime. You can
[1:46:30] put on the best robe anytime." And I
[1:46:33] need to say to some of you faithful
[1:46:35] people, the robe is hanging there.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to take another
[1:46:40] look at the ring. Yeah.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; I had a man look at my ring here, my
[1:46:43] wedding ring few days ago. Just a
[1:46:46] contractor. And he said, "Nice ring."
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Well, it's not just the ring. It's what
[1:46:50] it means.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And who slipped it on?
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "He slipped on the
[1:46:57] ring of unmarited favor."
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; None of us are worthy of it. None of us
[1:47:03] are worthy. But he did it. He slips it
[1:47:06] on. Hallelujah.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; You could look at it and say, "Unmarit's
[1:47:11] favor. I wasn't worthy of this, but he
[1:47:14] gave it to me."
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; And I asked myself, and I'm going to be
[1:47:22] closing soon.
[1:47:24] What is it that called?
[1:47:29] I can tell you one thing. I just tell
[1:47:31] you this personally.
[1:47:34] Whenever I hear a tape
[1:47:37] I have never ever
[1:47:40] gotten tired of in all the years of my
[1:47:44] life.
[1:47:49] And like you young people especially, I
[1:47:51] talked to Ella
[1:47:53] who you know is she's in Portland today
[1:47:56] on her way to Portland. Her her daddy
[1:47:58] and mom are taking her down to Portland
[1:48:02] and and
[1:48:05] You know, you got it good.
[1:48:07] Here's a girl got sores on her legs in a
[1:48:11] big cast. And I don't know why. I said,
[1:48:14] "Father, if you could tell me
[1:48:17] why she's not healed.
[1:48:20] I don't know why yet. We believed." But
[1:48:23] I said to her, I said, "Ella
[1:48:26] cramp, want you to listen to the the
[1:48:29] healing lines
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; and hear the prophet of God."
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Telling the people telling the people
[1:48:37] where they are and their names and their
[1:48:39] heritage and and their sickness and
[1:48:41] disease or what's on their heart. And
[1:48:43] you're standing here for someone else.
[1:48:45] You're standing here for a man. It's the
[1:48:47] man is bes I see a man beside you. Who
[1:48:50] is that? That's not William Brandon.
[1:48:53] That's the Lord Jesus Christ. That's the
[1:48:55] message.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; And when I hear that, I'm pulled.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; I have a call and I'm being called by
[1:49:02] it. Are you feeling the call? Are you
[1:49:05] hearing the call?
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; And I said to Ella, you listen to them.
[1:49:13] She says right away, I'll do that,
[1:49:15] Grandpa.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Right away. never complains about her
[1:49:21] situation, never complains
[1:49:25] about all the pain that she's been in
[1:49:28] and months
[1:49:29] and now years.
[1:49:33] Friends, as a congregation, I'm talking
[1:49:35] to you as a man. I'm talking to you as a
[1:49:37] father. I'm talking to you as a
[1:49:38] grandfather and a great-grandfather.
[1:49:40] I would do anything.
[1:49:43] I would give anything.
[1:49:45] I'd give my own life to see that she was
[1:49:48] healed. I said, 'Well, there has to be
[1:49:50] some purpose.
[1:49:52] My father knows about it.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Maybe the purpose is that it's making
[1:49:57] somebody more God conscious,
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's making somebody
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; not only more God conscious, but giving
[1:50:06] them a a greater intensity, a greater
[1:50:09] hunger to find out,
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; you know, Father, what what is it that
[1:50:12] you've sent me?
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Maybe someone is in the message more
[1:50:15] than they would be if the child was
[1:50:18] healed.
[1:50:19] But I don't know. All I say is we have
[1:50:22] every reason
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; to to feel very human,
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Don't look at the ministry as being
[1:50:30] something way up there and they're not
[1:50:31] affected. We are affected by things.
[1:50:33] We're affected by people and we are
[1:50:35] burden bearers.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; We can't help that.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; These brothers bear a lot of burdens not
[1:50:42] only here locally but well beyond this.
[1:50:45] And why? One thing that I know that we
[1:50:47] receive and I receive it from these
[1:50:49] brothers when they preach. One thing I
[1:50:51] know, this message is nothing other than
[1:50:55] the very person of Jesus Christ moving
[1:50:58] amongst the congregation, moving amongst
[1:51:01] the people
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; receiving them.
[1:51:04] [Music]
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; I see it as a as a as an actual motion.
[1:51:09] And I begin to ask myself, Father, when
[1:51:12] were when was this father receiving his
[1:51:15] son? Was it when he saw him a far off?
[1:51:18] Was it when he was running? Was it when
[1:51:20] he kissed him? Was it when he received
[1:51:22] him into the house? Was it when he put
[1:51:24] the robe on? Was it when he put the
[1:51:26] finger ring on his finger? When was he
[1:51:28] receiving him? He's receiving him all
[1:51:30] the time.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; He's receiving you in every service.
[1:51:34] He's receiving you when you hear the men
[1:51:36] preach.
[1:51:38] You want to have a listening ear.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Oh God, you're going to say something to
[1:51:44] me that's going to nudge me forward in
[1:51:47] this process of being received. And one
[1:51:49] day I'll just take a step and I'll be in
[1:51:52] Father's house. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:51:56] Hallelujah to God.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; You're going to see someone there. Hey,
[1:52:04] we're not talking about we're not
[1:52:07] talking about some, you know, pipe
[1:52:09] dream. We're not talking about some you
[1:52:11] euphoric thing. We're talking about
[1:52:13] reality more real than this pest house.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; It's father's house.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; You're going to see a young blackheaded
[1:52:21] man.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; On the other side, it won't be very
[1:52:27] different than this one.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; He'll be just as happy there as he is
[1:52:31] here.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:34] Glory to God.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Say it's a perfect message
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; back to a perfect word
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; to get that bride. That's a duty.
[1:52:55] That's what I'm here for. Glory.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't want to be very far from
[1:53:02] that, would you?
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm here for. He said,
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; "That's what I'm trying to do
[1:53:12] is to call out a bride.
[1:53:18] I'm closing now. Just a moment.
[1:53:21] When was Rebecca being received?
[1:53:27] And the prophet of God, he speaks about
[1:53:29] El E Ele Elizer,
[1:53:32] Abraham's servant,
[1:53:34] go find my son a wife.
[1:53:37] In the message is shamed of him. He
[1:53:39] tells about Eleazar. He said, "Let me
[1:53:42] like I let me like Eleazar."
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; He says that
[1:53:49] help me now.
[1:53:53] He says he had to sweat it out. Ezer had
[1:53:56] to sweat it out looking for character.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Then when he found character and he he
[1:54:03] he said and he talks about Elizer and he
[1:54:05] said, "And if that man is here,
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; if that man is here, he talks about let
[1:54:13] him find the bride with character."
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; And then may she stand still.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. long enough,
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; And then I'll dress her.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; I say, "Oh, God. Oh, God."
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; How we need to get out of the rat race
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; of this pest house.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; When you're done your running, it'll
[1:54:37] still be a pest house.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; When you're done your labors, it'll
[1:54:41] still be a pest house. Need to stop,
[1:54:44] stand still, know that I'm God.
[1:54:47] [Applause]
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; The same God.
[1:54:51] Speak Lord
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; that I might hear you.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; You're too good for the best house
[1:55:01] friends.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that's where they
[1:55:04] pull people with diseases.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; That's what this world is.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; It's a diseased place. Don't think that
[1:55:14] he's going to leave us here.
[1:55:16] He's going to renovate this place with
[1:55:19] fire from heaven.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; The earth will belch forth.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; It might be fine today.
[1:55:33] I just had a video sent me by a believer
[1:55:39] talking about the West Coast.
[1:55:42] You're no safer anywhere else.
[1:55:46] We'd have an atomic bomb if it was
[1:55:48] possible drop on our head and we'll be
[1:55:50] as safe as if you're a believer. You're
[1:55:53] in Christ.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I I think I I think
[1:55:59] they just had the location exact. Not
[1:56:01] quite right, but I have I have a
[1:56:05] vindicated prophet.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I've I've stretched out
[1:56:08] further today and choosing a bride." And
[1:56:11] we had sister
[1:56:14] Jake and I Garner.
[1:56:17] Sister Garner was in that meeting and
[1:56:20] she said there was about 700 people. And
[1:56:23] when he stretched out and he said he
[1:56:25] spoke about oh Los Angeles, Los Angeles
[1:56:28] calls thyself after the name of the
[1:56:31] angels. Los Angeles angels. He said
[1:56:35] you're going to sink down yonder. you're
[1:56:37] going to slide into the ocean into that
[1:56:40] great ocean and the wave come back maybe
[1:56:44] to the salt and sea and he described it.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; We also had Dr. SC Jacob here from the
[1:56:52] University of Badras which is Chennai
[1:56:55] now
[1:56:57] I think maybe brother Titus you know
[1:56:59] brother do Dr. Jacob.
[1:57:02] Well, once when I had arrived there to
[1:57:04] see him,
[1:57:06] he had a he had a a group of people from
[1:57:09] Russia, from Moscow, from the government
[1:57:12] of Moscow in China or Russia rather, and
[1:57:15] they were there because he was a he was
[1:57:18] a a a doctor that understood the crust
[1:57:21] of the earth. And he stood in our
[1:57:24] congregation. And you may remember that
[1:57:26] Ken when he stood here and he says he's
[1:57:31] a firm believer. He says, "Brother
[1:57:33] Brandham said that that will break off
[1:57:37] and slide into the ocean." He said, "You
[1:57:40] may not know the structure of the earth,
[1:57:43] but I do." And he talked he said the the
[1:57:46] structure of the earth under Los Angeles
[1:57:49] is all the sediment and the earth and
[1:57:51] whatever more. But he says at the rock
[1:57:54] bottom, the the rock part of it, he said
[1:57:58] it's actually on a slope but slopes
[1:58:00] towards
[1:58:02] the ocean
[1:58:04] and the the great chasm that's down
[1:58:07] there. And he said, "And between that
[1:58:10] and the and the earth is a a layer," he
[1:58:13] said, "of substance."
[1:58:15] He said, "I I he could describe it, but
[1:58:18] we wouldn't understand it." So he said
[1:58:19] the best way that you could understand
[1:58:21] it, he said it's like graphite.
[1:58:24] It's very smooth, very slippery. And
[1:58:27] when he said that it'll slide when that
[1:58:30] great earthquake takes place and it'll
[1:58:32] slide into the ocean, he said that's
[1:58:34] exactly what it's going to do.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; It's not if, it's when.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; And they're predicting massive
[1:58:42] earthquake for the cascades
[1:58:47] right now. I I don't know. I know one
[1:58:49] thing. God told us to be here.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; God told us to send the light from here.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; And when he's done with us, we'll go to
[1:58:57] our father's house.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he's done with you,
[1:59:00] we'll go to father's house. How many
[1:59:02] want to go to father's house? Of course
[1:59:04] we do.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Said that is to receive you.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; That is what he's doing this morning.
[1:59:17] That's what he's doing this morning.
[1:59:19] He's receiving you. He's taking maybe
[1:59:22] maybe he's putting a garment. Maybe you
[1:59:24] haven't had a wedding robe. Brother
[1:59:26] Brandham said if she'll stand still long
[1:59:28] enough, I'll dress her.
[1:59:34] Heavenly Father,
[1:59:41] I don't know exactly what I'm going to
[1:59:43] pray, but I'm going to pray from my
[1:59:44] heart.
[1:59:46] If you feel to be included,
[1:59:49] if there's a call,
[1:59:52] you can stand
[1:59:54] and I'll we'll pray together.
[2:00:00] Father,
[2:00:03] our Lord Jesus spoke and it's recorded.
[2:00:08] I go to prepare a place for you,
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; father's house.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; It took the world, it took the religious
[2:00:14] world by surprise when you were coming
[2:00:18] again and you began to do all the
[2:00:19] miracles you did and you took a a
[2:00:22] vessel. You took a messenger,
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Father, that was not educated in all the
[2:00:27] education that we might have, but he
[2:00:29] knew the author real well.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; He knew the author of this book we call
[2:00:33] the Bible. And he could make that Bible,
[2:00:36] you through him, could make the Bible
[2:00:38] live again. God,
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; I said myself when a walking out of a
[2:00:43] meeting, walking out of that presence,
[2:00:45] it's like I just walked out of the pages
[2:00:47] of the Bible. You became so alive when
[2:00:51] you came out of the pages of the Bible
[2:00:53] and out of that mouth you spoke. Oh God
[2:00:57] and scriptures in his mouth seemed so
[2:01:00] deep and so wonderful and so beyond
[2:01:02] hearing it with the natural ear because
[2:01:05] there was something in the soul. The
[2:01:07] ears of the soul was hearing it. Oh God.
[2:01:11] And I don't know who it is this morning
[2:01:14] who you might be ministering to. Who it
[2:01:16] is you're calling. Which son? which
[2:01:18] daughter who it is. Lord, we know not
[2:01:21] the heart, but I'm so glad you know the
[2:01:23] heart. You know the heart of man. You
[2:01:26] know our needs. Father, I pray for those
[2:01:29] that are streaming in whatever country
[2:01:31] they might be, in whatever time zone
[2:01:34] they might be. Move, I pray, oh God. And
[2:01:38] out of that screen, may they realize
[2:01:41] that God the Father's running to them to
[2:01:45] take them from where they are. There's
[2:01:47] believers here, Lord. We've walked,
[2:01:49] maybe some have walked with you for
[2:01:51] years. But we need to realize that
[2:01:53] there's another motion. There's another
[2:01:56] move. There's another aspect of being
[2:01:59] received by the father. Father, father,
[2:02:03] I pray you'll embrace this people. I
[2:02:07] pray that you'll come to their house,
[2:02:10] come to their place, come to their
[2:02:13] address, come to their seat right now.
[2:02:19] We raise our heart
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; to you, oh Lord,
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; oh Lord Jesus.
[2:02:27] Oh Lord Jesus, this is the most
[2:02:28] important thing that could happen.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; We want to put people in contact with
[2:02:34] you.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; I counsel to you that are here,
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; whether you're seated or whether you're
[2:02:43] standing or whether you're on the
[2:02:44] internet,
[2:02:46] is that you profess something. Confess
[2:02:48] something to him.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Tell him something of your hunger.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; I'm your son. I'm your daughter.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; And I know that I have something more.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; There's something more for me just now.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask Wesley if you'll come
[2:03:10] please.
[2:03:12] I'd like you to sing
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; something we're so familiar with. It is
[2:03:16] well with my soul.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; When peace like a river
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; attendeth my way.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Oh God, somebody needs this peace.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; This past house is full of distress. In
[2:03:31] the name of Jesus Christ, I resist this
[2:03:34] distress and the pressure that people
[2:03:37] are under. We know that it's a pressure
[2:03:39] life. My precious brother, my precious
[2:03:42] sister, do not allow it to persuade you.
[2:03:46] Do not allow it to be your guide.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Let the prophet's word, oh God, as he
[2:03:52] spoke out of the scripture, let the
[2:03:55] words of Jesus be your guide. May the
[2:03:59] Holy Spirit, which was sent to be our
[2:04:01] guide, be a witness. Father, in this
[2:04:04] service,
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; you said people pray with me. Would you
[2:04:09] please?
[2:04:10] I want I want him to have his
[2:04:14] perfect way.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Remember the enemy would try to struggle
[2:04:18] against it all he can.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; I will not give in to the enemy.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; I will not give in to the enemy your
[2:04:24] soul.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We take every authority
[2:04:29] in the name of Jesus Christ and
[2:04:32] authority over the human spirits in the
[2:04:35] name of Jesus Christ that we might be
[2:04:37] obedient to the voice of God.
[2:04:41] Oh God, oh God of Israel,
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; God Jehovah God,
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; mighty God, mighty God,
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; thy will, thy will be done on earth as
[2:04:53] it is in heaven.
[2:04:55] Maybe people have schedules. Forget your
[2:04:58] schedule.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Let's get into God's time zone.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[2:05:11] Lord.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Let us listen prayerfully.
[2:05:24] Brother West, would you just start to
[2:05:26] sing? Partway through, we'll join in
[2:05:30] some of the rich and wonderful
[2:05:32] inspired verses.
[2:05:37] When peace
[2:05:39] like
[2:05:42] a river
[2:05:47] attendeth
[2:05:50] my way.
[2:05:54] When sorrows
[2:05:59] like sea billows
[2:06:02] roll,
[2:06:10] whatever
[2:06:13] [Music]
[2:06:14] my Lord,
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; yes, thou hast taught me
[2:06:21] [Applause]
[2:06:22] to

[2:07:12] while a song is being sung
[2:07:16] and there's something within you if the
[2:07:18] call within you not a call for prayer
[2:07:21] but a call of the master's voice
[2:07:27] don't ask me to explain it I cannot but
[2:07:30] you'll know it
[2:07:33] and if the call is saying and your heart
[2:07:35] is saying
[2:07:37] I'm better down at the front than I am
[2:07:39] here.
[2:07:41] I need to make a declaration.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; I've heard something.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; I've heard something divine.
[2:07:48] I've heard something from Father's
[2:07:50] house.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; I have never responded, but I want to
[2:07:55] respond. I want to indicate to him.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; I'm turning around.
[2:08:03] [Music]
[2:08:06] We'll soon pray together
[2:08:08] as we sing the next verse, please.
[2:08:12] Though Satan
[2:08:16] should buff it,
[2:08:20] though trials
[2:08:23] may come,
[2:08:27] let this
[2:08:29] bless
[2:08:31] assurance
[2:08:35] of control.

[2:17:58] that this isn't the voice.
[2:18:00] What you're hearing is not the voice of
[2:18:03] a man. You're hearing the voice of
[2:18:07] something. I can't define it other than
[2:18:09] to say the Holy Spirit of God pulling
[2:18:13] you, drawing you. Say, I know it's real.
[2:18:16] I know it's true. And that he might

[2:18:37] ambitions go.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Just let him have it in his hand. Let
[2:18:42] him have control of it.

[2:18:47] [Music]
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; I feel the poor.
[2:18:53] I feel the pull. You feel it?
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; I hear
[2:18:58] the call.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; You hear it
[2:19:04] in his

[2:19:56] and perhaps someone oh God or maybe
[2:19:58] those that
[2:19:59] [Music]
[2:20:02] you have spoken to very very deeply.
[2:20:07] They don't know exactly what to do, what
[2:20:09] it is you require.
[2:20:11] But after we leave the doors of this
[2:20:14] building,
[2:20:16] we will not be out of contact with you.
[2:20:19] And I pray that you'll continue to
[2:20:21] speak. And let words, oh God, chosen by
[2:20:25] the mind of God, let those words, oh
[2:20:28] God, keep rotating within the mind and
[2:20:31] the soul and down into the heart of your
[2:20:34] children, your sons and your daughters.
[2:20:37] Bless, I pray, the family of God. Bless
[2:20:41] I pray everyone Lord of those that have
[2:20:45] have felt to come and be prayed with and
[2:20:49] to offer themselves and those that you
[2:20:52] had on your mind. Oh God, some that you
[2:20:56] talk to me about. And Father, today has
[2:21:00] been a critical day. Now is a very
[2:21:02] special time. And take them from this
[2:21:05] morning service. Take them from this
[2:21:08] time on, oh God. And I pray as they will
[2:21:11] feel your arms as you take them and
[2:21:14] embrace them and and draw them to
[2:21:16] yourself. Take them into your house, oh
[2:21:19] God. Show them the robe, I pray. Let
[2:21:22] them stand still long enough and you'll

[2:21:27] and dress them, oh father, in your word,
[2:21:31] the glorious garment of the word. Bless
[2:21:35] this people, I pray. Father, I thank you

[2:21:48] living God. You're not some stone or
[2:21:51] idol.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; You're not some building. You're not
[2:21:53] some denomination.
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; You're not just this building of
[2:21:57] Cloverdale Bible Way. You're much more
[2:21:59] than that.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; But let it be a witness to the people
[2:22:02] that this is a place dedicated to where
[2:22:04] the people can have you come and speak
[2:22:07] to them
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; and reveal yourself. Oh living word,
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; we thank you.
[2:22:17] Let the people be dismissed with peace
[2:22:20] in Jesus name.
