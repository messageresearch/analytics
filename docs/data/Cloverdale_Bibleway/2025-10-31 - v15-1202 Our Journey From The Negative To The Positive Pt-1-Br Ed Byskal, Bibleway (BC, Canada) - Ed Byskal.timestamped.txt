[9:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's coming.
[9:27] &gt;&gt; Noah said, "It's going to rain."
[9:29] &gt;&gt; It hadn't rained and he climbed in the
[9:31] ark and he was still saying, "It's going
[9:33] to rain." Seven days went by and the
[9:35] rains fell. [music]
[9:36] He's coming.
[9:38] &gt;&gt; It might not be while we're in this this
[9:40] service, but he's coming.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it tonight?
[9:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Why don't we stand
[9:44] together? Elijah's God is with us
[9:47] &gt;&gt; today. [music] Can we sing that
[9:48] together? 287, I think it is, on the
[9:50] screen.
[9:52] He's here. Elijah's [music]
[9:54] God is with us today.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; Elijah might be gone, but he's here.
[9:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:02] He's [music and singing] here.
[10:04] Elijah is God is with us.

[10:14] [singing]
[10:17] [music]
[10:18] Heat. Heat. Heat. [singing]
[10:25] [music]
[10:28] [singing]
[10:28] I
[10:30] see
[10:34] you [music]
[10:38] all
[10:40] my way. He's here. [music]

[10:49] [music]
[10:50] Elijah is God is with us today. He's
[10:55] here to help and to [music] whatever we
[10:59] say. [singing]
[11:00] Behold the rise of Christ full of rain.
[11:06] He's here [music and singing]
[11:08] like God is here.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we just [music] sing as
[11:15] we're going to read a couple of prayer
[11:17] requests tonight? Word of God, speak.
[11:20] Would you fall down [music] like rain?
[11:23] making our eyes to see. We want to
[11:26] behold his majesty tonight. Amen.
[11:29] [music] We've got a number of prayer
[11:30] requests. Brother Mike Gier, would you
[11:32] mind coming and open the service for us
[11:34] tonight, Brother Mike? Appreciate that.
[11:35] [music]
[11:37] Want to remember uh Sister Bev, this is
[11:40] from Sister Luis Wood. Her mother is not
[11:43] well, may not [music] live long. Just
[11:45] ask that the Lord would have his way in
[11:48] the family. William Smouts to remember
[11:51] Holly's [music] brother Scott in need of
[11:53] prayer. He has AIDS. Most of all, he
[11:57] needs salvation.
[11:59] [music] Uh there's a girlfriend that
[12:01] also needs prayer.
[12:04] Her [music] heart seems to be softening
[12:06] towards the things of God. So, we just
[12:08] want to remember that need tonight.
[12:10] Sister Clara Woman asks us to [music]
[12:12] remember Sister Anga Stefan Hagen. She's
[12:14] in the hospital in Edmonton with severe
[12:16] pain in her bones.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; [music]
[12:18] &gt;&gt; The doctors say her bones are actually
[12:20] collapsing. So, we want to remember that
[12:22] need tonight. I want to remember
[12:24] Jonathan [music] Frey at home tonight.
[12:26] He was exposed to some fumes at work. Uh
[12:29] they need [music] to have him take a
[12:31] test to see if he was exposed to
[12:34] anything hazardous. We're just asking
[12:36] that all of the tests [music] show no
[12:38] exposure to anything dangerous. Amen. We
[12:40] believe that. Brother [music] Jose
[12:42] Rosales wants to uh remember a friend's
[12:46] wife who's been diagnosed with stage 4
[12:48] cancer, only has six months to live.
[12:50] Pray that God will move on the scene
[12:52] spiritually [music] and naturally for
[12:54] that family. Also want to remember
[12:56] sister uh Connie Spencer, [music]
[12:58] brother Ron Spencer's wife. We all know
[13:00] the family very well here. U she's
[13:03] having some [music] tests done and uh a
[13:05] biopsy and one of her lungs collapsed I
[13:08] believe today and very painful. They're
[13:11] just waiting [music] for the lung to
[13:12] reinflate again. But that's not an easy
[13:14] process to go through for anybody. So,
[13:17] we want to remember, Sister Connie, that
[13:18] the Lord, the great physician [music]
[13:21] himself, would step into the situation.
[13:25] Amen. We also want to remember a old
[13:28] soldier of the cross, [music] brother
[13:30] Jackie Benton, in uh
[13:32] um he's there in [music] Elizabeth,
[13:35] Tennessee at brother Donnie Reagan's
[13:37] church. How many know the name Jackie
[13:38] Benton? Probably very few. [music] just
[13:40] a handful. Uh I was probably four years
[13:43] old when he was [music] preaching in a
[13:45] house meetings that I I didn't know I
[13:47] was attending, but I was there and
[13:49] [music] he came to the hospital when we
[13:50] were at Children's in Philadelphia with
[13:53] David several years [music] ago. And uh
[13:56] it was incredible. He recounted things
[13:59] that I had no recollection of
[14:00] remembering. And [music] at four years
[14:02] old, you don't remember things. But God
[14:04] has a a plan. God has a mind. And he
[14:07] sees [music] time. and all of those
[14:09] things are really fade when it comes to
[14:11] God things. We just want to remember
[14:13] [music] brother Jackie tonight. He's
[14:14] having I think a back procedure
[14:17] operation. So, we just ask that [music]
[14:18] the Lord would have his gentle hand on
[14:21] the case. Brother Mike, if you have a
[14:23] need [music] upon your heart, why don't
[14:24] you lift it up before the Lord as we go
[14:26] to prayer this evening?
[14:32] Let's bow our hearts.
[14:36] our precious heavenly [music] father.
[14:39] Lord, we're so thankful that we can call
[14:42] you our father. [music]
[14:45] Lord, where would we be Lord if he had
[14:47] not come for us? Oh God,
[14:52] what a privilege Lord, [music]
[14:55] we thank you, Lord, that we could find
[14:57] ourselves in the house of God tonight.
[14:59] And Lord, that we could [music] come to
[15:02] you, Lord.
[15:04] Many hearts burdened, Lord, many needs.
[15:06] Lord, you've heard each one that was
[15:08] read. You knew the heart as it was
[15:10] pinned down, Lord Jesus.
[15:14] Father, you are the author and the
[15:15] finisher of our faith, Lord God. And we
[15:18] would ask you, Lord, as we would bind
[15:20] our hearts together now, Lord Jesus.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, that you would rise up on the
[15:25] scene, Lord, for these requests, Lord.
[15:28] You are a mighty God, Lord Jesus.
[15:31] Lord, you have left us apart to do,
[15:33] [music] Father. You asked us to pray,
[15:35] Lord. These requests have come before
[15:38] the bride of Jesus Christ, Lord. And we
[15:40] bring them before you. We place them in
[15:43] your lap, Lord Jesus. We know that you
[15:47] are more than able, Father.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, we just commit him into your
[15:52] hands. We rest, Lord Jesus, in the
[15:54] promise, Lord, that we ask anything in
[15:57] your name, we shall have it, Lord. And
[16:00] we are more than two or three agreeing
[16:02] here, Lord Jesus.
[16:05] Lord, we know that it is finished and we
[16:07] thank you for it, oh [music] God. We
[16:10] turn our hearts now to the word, Lord
[16:12] Jesus. We look forward [music] to
[16:13] hearing from you once again through our
[16:16] pastor, Lord Jesus. And we ask you,
[16:18] Lord, that you would give him voice,
[16:20] that you would give him strength, Lord
[16:22] Jesus. That Lord, that you would quicken
[16:25] his mind, oh God. [music] that he would
[16:27] be able to deliver the word, Lord Jesus.
[16:30] And Father, would you do the same for
[16:32] our hearts, Lord, open us up, Lord
[16:35] Jesus. Lord, massage our heart, Lord.
[16:38] Make it soft unto you, Lord Jesus, that
[16:40] your word that could have its entrance,
[16:43] oh God, and that we would grow, Lord.
[16:46] Lord, that we could become like you,
[16:48] Lord Jesus. We love you, Father. Lord,
[16:52] you hear the voice of your people, Lord.
[16:55] [music] It is just so good, Lord, to
[16:57] hear the saints praying, Lord, and
[16:59] worshiping you, Lord Jesus. Tender
[17:02] hearts before you, Lord, lifting up holy
[17:05] hands, oh God. We bless your name. We
[17:07] praise you, Lord. We thank you, Father.
[17:10] [music]
[17:11] Great things you have done, Lord.
[17:16] Have your way this evening, Lord Jesus.
[17:18] [music]
[17:19] We commit ourselves to you and we thank
[17:21] you for these things in your precious
[17:23] and holy name, Lord Jesus Christ.
[17:26] [music]
[17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; God [singing] speak.
[17:32] Word you pull down like [music] rain,
[17:36] causing my [singing] eyes to see
[17:41] your [music] majesty.

[17:49] you're in this place.
[17:53] Peace [singing] and be [music]

[18:14] your [music]
[18:17] peace. I know [singing]
[18:21] your angels.

[21:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:22] I'm going to start [music] the service
[21:25] just a little bit different. I'm I'm
[21:27] going to uh
[21:29] going to read a [music] prayer that
[21:30] brother Brandham prayed and uh
[21:34] and he he he read the repeated the words
[21:38] of the song. Blessed Savior, thou will
[21:41] guide us [music]
[21:42] till we reach that blissful shore where
[21:46] the angels wait to join us [music] in
[21:49] his praise forever more. Maybe we'll
[21:51] just stand and and we can sing that.
[21:54] Those of you that know it and those that
[21:55] don't know it, hum along and you'll know
[21:57] it the second time.
[22:02] [music]
[22:07] Can we get the words up? Just
[22:11] [music] I was the only one in the study
[22:13] that really was acquainted with it. And
[22:15] uh then when I began to kind of rasp it
[22:18] out uh yeah, they'd heard it before. And
[22:22] uh brother John used his uh technical
[22:25] skills and found it's in the sound book.
[22:29] Up to that time I told him I said I
[22:31] thought the train was going backwards.
[22:33] It's uh life is like a a mountain
[22:37] railway. That's the name of the song.
[22:39] But we're not going to sing the verses
[22:41] and we're not interested in the railroad
[22:42] or this evening. We're just going to
[22:44] sing blessed Savior, thou will guide us.
[22:48] How many here know it? That's what I
[22:50] thought. [laughter]
[22:53] All right, I'll depend on you to really
[22:56] lift it up on that first first note. All
[22:59] right, blessed Savior starts up high.
[23:02] [music]
[23:04] Blessed Savior, [singing]
[23:07] thou will [music] guide us
[23:10] till we reach
[23:12] our [music] place for sure [singing]
[23:16] where the angels
[23:19] [singing] wait to join us
[23:22] in [music] thy gra
[23:24] for
[23:31] [music]
[23:32] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[23:34] &gt;&gt; we
[23:36] [music]
[23:37] will show
[23:39] where the [music]
[23:45] in [singing]
[23:48] forever
[23:52] Yeah. [music]
[23:55] [singing]
[23:58] [music]
[24:08] [music]
[24:10] [singing]
[24:11] forever.
[24:14] [music]
[24:15] Brother Brandham quotes those lines just
[24:18] before he prays or it's in his prayer
[24:23] and while you're standing I'll just read
[24:25] the rest of it that [music] and the the
[24:29] service was life story. That was his
[24:31] life story.
[24:33] And he says, uh, that's the words of the
[24:36] poet, and we love thee today, Lord. We
[24:40] realize that men [music]
[24:43] that men that have ever amounted to
[24:45] anything on earth were men [music] who
[24:48] trusted you. You thrilled the hearts of
[24:51] the poet, [music] the heart of the poet,
[24:55] spoke to your church, made the [music]
[24:58] weary to be happy. This is what we're
[25:01] gathered here for tonight. You've made
[25:02] the weary to be happy, the lost saved,
[25:07] the sick to be well, those without hope
[25:10] are given a hope and given us such a
[25:14] great promise that there's a and then he
[25:16] stops. He said, "This is just the
[25:20] negative." And this is what I'm going to
[25:22] be speaking on. This is just the
[25:25] negative, [music] the shadow. And
[25:28] someday that death shall develop [music]
[25:30] the picture from the negative to the
[25:33] positive. And I want to speak on our
[25:36] journey from the negative to the
[25:38] positive.
[25:41] And when we go through the terrible acid
[25:44] of death, then we'll know as we're known
[25:48] and see face to face. And while we're
[25:50] here, Lord, today preparing ourselves by
[25:53] singing psalms and testifying and
[25:57] reading thy word, we pray that you will
[26:00] meet with us. And grant [music] today
[26:03] that if there be any here who does not
[26:05] know thee, that they will become thy
[26:08] servant today. And I I certainly pray
[26:11] that. And we pray that you will just
[26:14] bless us together. And may the Holy
[26:16] Spirit now just get a hold of every
[26:19] heart and dear God [music] as I fear the
[26:23] moment to go back down through the long
[26:26] bloody [music] tear stained journey that
[26:28] I traveled and review that over in my
[26:32] heart again. My heart is troubled.
[26:34] [music]
[26:35] But then when I think of it, I think of
[26:37] the song Amazing Grace, how sweet the
[26:40] sound that saved a wretch like me. I
[26:43] once was lost [music] but now I'm found.
[26:45] Was blind but now I see. Now Lord help
[26:48] us today. And [music] may may the Holy
[26:52] Spirit be here and bless us in this
[26:54] gathering for we ask it in the name of
[26:57] the beloved child Jesus. [music]
[27:00] Amen.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; And so we're just going to have a word
[27:02] of prayer. Our heavenly father,
[27:05] [clears throat] how we thank you for
[27:06] these words and how we thank you for the
[27:08] inspiration that you gave as a prophet
[27:11] of God said to the poet and [music] he
[27:14] penned some words down. Blessed Savior,
[27:17] thou wilt guide us. How true those words
[27:20] are. And tonight we we revel in it,
[27:23] Lord. We our confidence is unshakable.
[27:26] [music] We thank you, Father. While the
[27:28] world is wrestling with insoluble
[27:31] problems here, yet we have a Christ that
[27:34] is the answer to every one of our
[27:36] questions in our heart, oh God. And even
[27:39] when we have questions that you do not
[27:41] answer, [music] we know that even your
[27:43] silence is an answer because you're the
[27:46] beloved one of eternity. And as we
[27:49] approach [music] a subject this evening,
[27:51] Lord, I pray that you will bless the
[27:53] people. Give us open hearts, oh God. And
[27:56] as I open my mouth to speak, put words
[27:58] there, Father. [music] Words that are
[28:00] fitted and suited and made for your
[28:02] children. In the name of Jesus Christ,
[28:04] we ask it. Amen. And amen. God bless
[28:08] you. [music] Thank you, musicians. And
[28:10] brother Ryan,
[28:12] I want to read from the book of Acts,
[28:14] chapter 1.
[28:17] We'll just read from the first verse.
[28:19] [clears throat]
[28:31] Nice to have you all here this evening
[28:32] and we pray that God will certainly
[28:37] uh bless us together.
[28:40] The former treatise have I made, O
[28:43] Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both
[28:45] to do and teach, until the day in which
[28:49] he was taken up after that he through
[28:52] the Holy Ghost had given commandments
[28:54] unto the apostles whom he had chosen, to
[28:58] whom also he showed himself alive after
[29:00] his passion by many infallible proofs,
[29:04] being seen of them 40 days, and speaking
[29:07] of the things pertaining to the kingdom
[29:10] of God. And being assembled together
[29:13] with them, commanded them that they
[29:15] should not depart from Jerusalem, but
[29:18] wait for the promise of the Father,
[29:20] which says he, "You have heard of me.
[29:23] For John truly baptized with water, but
[29:26] you shall be baptized with the Holy
[29:28] Ghost not many days hence." God bless
[29:32] you. You may have your seats.
[29:44] I was just uh inspired by some
[29:48] uh words that brother Brandham had spoke
[29:51] and I want to share those with you. Um I
[29:56] have some slides a little later on
[29:58] [clears throat] but I want to take this
[30:00] subject and this is all uh preparatory
[30:04] to the subject. I want you to think
[30:06] about it. Our journey
[30:09] from the negative to the positive.
[30:13] The other day I was inspired. I I left
[30:15] the platform while either brother John
[30:17] or brother Tim were preaching and I just
[30:20] went into the study for a few moments.
[30:23] Um, I took a big full scap pad and I
[30:26] began to write. And I I was just going
[30:29] to put down one thought that I had for
[30:32] [clears throat]
[30:33] this evening. And I I I just I wrote
[30:36] till that whole page was full. And I
[30:38] turned it over and continued to write a
[30:41] few more lines. And uh I just I had to
[30:45] read it over to my wife. I felt so
[30:47] inspired while and those moments do
[30:49] come. Not often enough, but they do
[30:51] come. And so, um, [clears throat]
[30:55] that isn't the basis of of, uh, what I
[30:57] want to say tonight, but it is, uh, the
[31:00] essence of it. We've got some of the the
[31:03] same thoughts. So, I I I want to, uh,
[31:07] have you ponder this our journey from
[31:11] the negative to the positive.
[31:16] uh [clears throat]
[31:17] in the in the message of
[31:20] uncertain of God or rather the uncertain
[31:23] sound it is. He said uh and talking
[31:27] about uh the people said you've got to
[31:30] tell him that he's a son of God born for
[31:34] the kingdom of God and he is somebody.
[31:38] This is just a negative picture, a
[31:41] negative waiting to be developed
[31:43] someday. And death is the only thing
[31:45] that can develop it. When you die out to
[31:48] yourself,
[31:49] &gt;&gt; so you don't have to die physically, but
[31:51] when you die out to yourself, a new
[31:54] picture starts on the inside. And then
[31:57] that new creature, Christ Jesus, begins
[32:01] to show itself through. And one of these
[32:04] days, he will come and receive you up up
[32:07] to himself. And then the whole thing
[32:10] will be changed. And then this negative
[32:13] shadow will become a positive.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Now this this may just be for one here,
[32:20] one over there and so on. But uh I
[32:23] that's why I'm giving as as much
[32:25] material as I am. Now in sers this s we
[32:29] would see Jesus not ser at the time but
[32:31] sers we would see Jesus in in Dallas,
[32:34] Texas. Now if if you were in his
[32:38] thinking at the beginning, if you've got
[32:41] eternal life, there is only one form of
[32:44] eternal life. Eternal life had no
[32:47] beginning and it has no ending. So if
[32:51] you have eternal life, you were an
[32:54] attribute of God's thinking before there
[32:57] was anything but him.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; I thought that was a tremendous
[33:02] statement.
[33:04] When there was when there was uh before
[33:08] there was anything but him. Your form,
[33:13] your shape, and what you're in now is
[33:16] just a negative. When you come up to
[33:20] around 20, 22 years old, you were a
[33:24] negative and death develops the picture
[33:27] to the positive. That when this earthly
[33:30] tabernacle is dissolved, we have one
[33:33] already. waiting and then I went to the
[33:37] scripture that we have read and then
[33:40] Jesus said in Luke's gospel you won't
[33:43] have to turn to it I'm just read one
[33:45] verse Luke 11 and2 and he said unto them
[33:49] when you pray say our father which art
[33:53] in heaven hallowed be thy name thy
[33:56] kingdom come thy will be done as in
[34:00] heaven so in the earth
[34:04] Um so uh I'm I'm just starting off this
[34:09] our our journey in this negative time.
[34:12] Uh the prophet said that there are only
[34:15] two kingdoms.
[34:17] There's only two powers.
[34:19] So now we're we're either journeying in
[34:22] one or the other. But he said, "Do you
[34:25] realize that there is really only two
[34:28] powers in all the universe?" Amen.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; That's a lot big space.
[34:33] Of all of our differences between
[34:36] nations and differences between each
[34:38] other and everything, it amounts up to
[34:41] two powers. I understand that there's
[34:44] almost 200 the leaders of almost 200
[34:47] nations that were have been meeting in
[34:49] Paris and they're wrestling with you
[34:53] know climate change and the environment
[34:56] and trying to make hey God's going to
[34:58] make it exactly right.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; That's what the millennium's all about.
[35:03] But you know the problem is they don't
[35:05] know the language of the Bible. They
[35:07] haven't made themselves familiar with
[35:09] the Bible. They're studying all kinds of
[35:11] other scientific things. And and this
[35:13] prophet would tell them exactly where
[35:15] that science is going to take them. It's
[35:16] going to take them to more death. The
[35:18] more advanced they will become, but
[35:20] they're using that as a as a recipe and
[35:23] it'll never never happen. It won't
[35:26] happen. I'm not negative about that. I'm
[35:28] very very positive because I believe
[35:30] it's going to happen. Only not the way
[35:33] that they are are wrestling with it. but
[35:36] they can't seem to come to a solution.
[35:38] And I was listening to I was listening
[35:41] to uh a a another he wasn't a scientist,
[35:45] but he was a reporter of some kind. And
[35:48] he just flashed back many many decades
[35:51] ago. They were talking about the
[35:52] environment then. It's not a new
[35:54] problem. [laughter]
[35:56] It's just not a new problem at all. But
[35:59] they're seeking to come up with
[36:00] solutions. And so I say even the wise
[36:03] men of the world and intellectual people
[36:06] and men of power and men of leadership
[36:10] qualities, they're wrestling with
[36:12] things. Friends, we need to be very very
[36:15] thankful that we have a promise.
[36:17] And it says there's only two powers in
[36:20] the universe of all of our differences
[36:22] between nations because they can't get
[36:24] them all on site even now. And there
[36:27] were and and this was 62. So 40 years
[36:30] ago they couldn't get everybody on side
[36:33] and differences between each other and
[36:36] everything.
[36:38] It all mounts up to two powers. There's
[36:41] only two powers and there's only two
[36:44] kingdoms. Two powers and two kingdoms.
[36:48] All the rest, the little minor things
[36:51] are connected with either one of those
[36:54] powers. And those powers is God's power
[36:57] and Satan's power. You know, everybody
[36:59] here needs to take that paragraph and
[37:04] just merge it right down into your home
[37:06] environment.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Say, whatever we're wrestling with,
[37:10] whatever we're deciding on, whatever
[37:13] we're trying to come to, we have to
[37:15] realize and we need to accept that
[37:18] there's only two powers we're dealing
[37:20] with. And it's it's one or the other.
[37:23] It's one or the other.
[37:26] In in Timothy, Paul said speaking uh he
[37:30] said, "Who hath saved us and called us?"
[37:34] So saved us number one, called us number
[37:38] two, with a holy calling. Number three,
[37:41] not according to our works. Number four,
[37:44] but according to his own purpose and
[37:45] grace. Number five, which was given us
[37:49] in Christ before the world began.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; So that's where it was given. It was
[37:57] given us in Christ. And that's why it
[38:00] was taking last in even in the last
[38:02] services that brother Brandham says,
[38:05] "Let's just have a little drama." And uh
[38:08] there's uh God who fills all time and
[38:11] space and you could go back billions and
[38:14] trillions of years. We can't he said
[38:17] it's too mysterious. He couldn't even
[38:18] reveal himself. He cannot. So how did he
[38:22] do it? He said that one of his
[38:24] attributes and here how we thank God do
[38:27] we have a a prophet of God that stood
[38:30] here and could get into the mind of God
[38:33] and and bring it right down here into
[38:35] language we could understand. I thank
[38:37] God that he only had a seventh grade
[38:39] education. You know, I thank God it was
[38:42] spoken of in such simplicity because
[38:44] Jesus when he was here, that was one of
[38:46] the things that people stumbled at that
[38:48] he spoke the gutal language of the poor
[38:52] which was the Galilean language and he
[38:55] assembled with Galilean people. I'm not
[38:57] pointing to you as Galileans, but he
[38:59] assembled with the with just the you
[39:02] know the the poor have the gospel
[39:04] preached to them. Thank God we're basic
[39:06] enough just to believe what he said.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; We come from humble beginnings and and
[39:11] we stay that way.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Are amen.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:18] So he has saved us and called us with a
[39:21] holy calling not according to our works
[39:24] but according to his own purpose and
[39:27] grace which was given us in Christ Jesus
[39:32] before the world began. So long before
[39:34] you arrived here, this was given you.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Long before your your forefathers ever
[39:42] thought of it. Long before America was
[39:45] discovered, long before mankind
[39:48] struggle, all these I've been reading
[39:50] through uh Samuel and David's wars and
[39:54] it was just incredible.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; They were in warfare all the time,
[39:59] &gt;&gt; and you just wonder where it's going.
[40:01] But you should read uh uh David's
[40:05] Thanksgiving to God. And I even
[40:07] marveled. I marveled. I read it
[40:09] yesterday or day before. I just read it
[40:11] and I just marveled how that man was so
[40:14] inspired. No wonder he was a man after
[40:16] God's own heart because he he says the
[40:19] same thing so many different ways and he
[40:22] glorifies God and he worships God. And
[40:25] that's what God loves is worship.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:31] And uh so he said that was in Christ
[40:35] Jesus that was given us in Christ Jesus
[40:40] in Christ Jesus before the world began.
[40:44] So you are an attribute of God's
[40:47] thinking before the world ever was
[40:51] created. Hallelujah.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Now, that that gets, you know, that gets
[40:56] way up here someplace. And uh I don't
[40:58] want to lose you.
[41:01] Uh
[41:03] and that life, I think I have this.
[41:09] I've got some quotes here. And that life
[41:13] that was in his thinking of you is in
[41:17] you now. He said, and I'm going to read
[41:20] that. A greater than Solomon is here.
[41:22] This is 1964.
[41:24] A greater than Solomon's here. Your name
[41:27] was put on God's book. Now, I'm going to
[41:30] try to follow exactly what the prophet
[41:32] said. You tell the son of God, you are a
[41:34] son of God
[41:39] &gt;&gt; and that you were in his thinking
[41:41] &gt;&gt; and that you have eternal life.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; And if you don't, that's God's business.
[41:47] But I'm saying this is what he's told us
[41:50] to say.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Tell him that he's the son of God.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Tell him we come to the
[41:55] house of God. This is where burdens are
[41:57] released. This is where the depressed
[42:00] are changed. This is where things I
[42:02] don't know how you came in the doors,
[42:04] but I don't expect you to go out the
[42:06] same way.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm standing here.
[42:09] Lord,
[42:11] &gt;&gt; your name [clears throat] was put in
[42:13] God's book before the lamb was slain
[42:16] when his program was laid out. The whole
[42:19] thing you were you were recognized in
[42:22] that program
[42:24] &gt;&gt; because you got eternal life. The word
[42:27] eternal never did begin and never can it
[42:30] end. And you are an attribute of God's
[42:33] thinking before the world was ever
[42:36] created. So, we're going back a long
[42:38] ways
[42:40] &gt;&gt; before the world was ever created. Uh,
[42:43] and that's the only way that you can
[42:45] have eternal life. And that life that
[42:49] was his thinking of you is in you. Now,
[42:53] I have to take these very slowly. And
[42:55] that life
[42:57] and that life that he was thinking of
[43:01] you,
[43:03] I don't care how he phrased it. It may
[43:05] not be grammarally correct by your
[43:08] learning, but it certainly is correct by
[43:11] heaven's learning.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; And that life that he was thinking of
[43:16] you is in you now.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; And there is no way to separate it. It's
[43:23] there to stay.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; That's enough to rejoice about. And
[43:31] there's no way to separate it. There
[43:33] isn't enough demons in hell to separate
[43:36] it and it's there to stay.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; In the uncertain sound again he says you
[43:47] came out of eternity. You stepped into a
[43:51] little space called time. You go out of
[43:55] time into eternity. And what you are in
[43:59] your soul as you go out the same you
[44:03] will be
[44:05] in perfection. In the message perfection
[44:07] he said before the world was ever formed
[44:11] you were placed in Christ. So in Christ
[44:14] you're called
[44:16] &gt;&gt; in Christ uh you're saved. In Christ,
[44:21] you have God's purpose and his grace
[44:25] which was given to you and given to us
[44:28] in Christ Jesus before the world was.
[44:31] That's why I'm going back here.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; You don't have to figure it out. All you
[44:36] have to do is accept it.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; You just have to accept it. We were
[44:41] placed in Christ.
[44:45] And then here's the quote I was asking
[44:47] you about.
[44:49] I found it
[44:52] in the unveiling of God. I've been
[44:55] trying to find this for some time and so
[44:57] I spent some time so I can share it with
[45:00] you. In the unveiling of God, he said
[45:03] that's the whole picture from Genesis to
[45:07] Revelation. So now we'll just describe
[45:10] it from Genesis to Revelation. Here's
[45:13] the whole picture in just a few words.
[45:16] Isn't that nice?
[45:20] It's nothing wrong. It's Elohim
[45:24] materializing
[45:26] so he can be touched
[45:29] feel. And in the millennium there is
[45:32] Elohim. That's where that's where you're
[45:34] heading. And in the millennium, there's
[45:37] Elohim sitting on the throne with all of
[45:42] his subjects around him
[45:44] &gt;&gt; that he predestinated before the
[45:46] foundation of the world.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; So now, isn't it wonderful?
[45:52] &gt;&gt; And there's Elohim with all of his
[45:55] subjects around him. All those subjects,
[45:58] all those subjects once were this great
[46:02] eternal being who the prophet said no
[46:04] one could understand. No one can he
[46:07] can't even reveal himself to it. He had
[46:09] to come and become a son of man. So
[46:13] because he had an attribute of
[46:14] fatherhood
[46:16] &gt;&gt; and then the apostle Paul says that he
[46:19] could through him through Christ he
[46:21] would bring many sons
[46:24] &gt;&gt; to glory. So we were in Christ.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; We were in Christ.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; And and when when the son came when uh
[46:32] that from the bosom of the father, he's
[46:35] the only one that could be the lamb.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; That attribute of savior was in in god.
[46:41] And so he had to become a son. And that
[46:44] was his attribute.
[46:46] And because of that attribute, there'll
[46:48] be many subjects that will be gathered
[46:51] around Elohim
[46:54] &gt;&gt; as he's and and one day one day it was
[46:57] only a thought. And God wasn't satisfied
[46:59] with just having his own thoughts. He
[47:02] wasn't satisfied with being alone just
[47:04] with his own thoughts.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; You know, when you get you get by
[47:08] yourself and you get buried deep in your
[47:10] own thoughts, you know, that's a pretty
[47:12] lonely spot really. It's pretty lonely
[47:16] spot. You want fellowship and you want
[47:18] friends and you want somebody to speak
[47:21] with and interact with and and someone
[47:24] who can understand you. We all crave
[47:27] that.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; And there we there he is with all of his
[47:32] subjects around him and that he
[47:35] predestinated before the foundation of
[47:38] the world.
[47:41] I have a question. What what kind of
[47:43] being would God be if he were not able
[47:47] to fulfill his purpose
[47:50] &gt;&gt; and have his subjects gathered around
[47:52] him? What kind of God would we be s
[47:55] would we be serving?
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, he's a great God, but now I I
[47:59] want to bring it down." And he'll have
[48:01] his subjects gathered around him.
[48:06] We're here this evening because you
[48:08] wanted to come to church and we're here
[48:10] together and we'll shake hands and pro.
[48:12] But is that if that's all that if that's
[48:15] all that Christianity was, it'd be
[48:17] pretty empty.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; We've got we've got to have some
[48:21] objective. We got to have some purpose.
[48:23] We got to have something that's uh you
[48:25] know intensely real to us. Amen.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; So what kind of a a [clears throat]
[48:32] being would it be if we if he was not
[48:36] able to fulfill his purpose and have his
[48:38] subjects gathered around him in his
[48:41] kingdom. In the chronicles, David
[48:44] blessed the Lord. The Bible says in
[48:46] chapter 29, "Wherefore David blessed the
[48:49] Lord before all the congregation, and
[48:52] David said, blessed be the Lord God of
[48:55] Israel our father forever and ever.
[48:59] Thine, O Lord, is the greatness and the
[49:03] power and the glory and the victory and
[49:07] the majesty for all that is in the
[49:09] heaven and in the earth is thine. Thine
[49:13] is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art
[49:15] exalted as head above all. Isn't that
[49:18] wonderful?
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Both riches and honor come of thee, and
[49:23] thou reignest over all, and in thine
[49:26] hand is power and might, and in thine
[49:29] hand it is made it it is it is to make
[49:32] great and to give strength unto all.
[49:39] But I can tell you, we're talking about
[49:41] our journey now,
[49:44] and I'll be filling a lot of gaps in
[49:46] between now and Sunday, Lord willing.
[49:50] But when the lamb took the book,
[49:53] when the lamb took the book, this
[49:55] attribute that came from God
[49:58] when he claimed the book,
[50:01] the one that had the substance in him
[50:04] &gt;&gt; to erase your sin. Yeah.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; The one that had the power in him to
[50:10] transform you.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; From a rascal
[50:16] &gt;&gt; to a son of God.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; The one that had the power over your
[50:20] mind and over your thoughts. The one
[50:23] that could bring you right next to the
[50:26] throne of Elohim.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Things that have happened and things
[50:31] that are yet to happen. But when he came
[50:34] and took the book and that is a many
[50:38] many messages have been preached on it.
[50:40] The ministers of the message preaching
[50:42] on it because the messenger made that
[50:44] very very real and your name was in the
[50:47] book. He says the book is the Bible in
[50:50] one place. He says the book is is where
[50:53] your names were put. And uh and Jesus
[50:56] said himself that every deed and every
[50:59] word that we speak would be accountable.
[51:01] Well, we wouldn't want the screen to
[51:03] come down and and and recall every
[51:05] thought that even we thought today. We
[51:08] we wouldn't want it displayed in front.
[51:10] But he who had the substance within him
[51:13] which was eternal life. And that life
[51:16] was greater than any unbelief.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; That life was greater than any
[51:20] transgression. If it wasn't, what kind
[51:23] of God is he? He's greater than any
[51:25] demon of force, any force of darkness.
[51:28] He's greater than any darkness. He's
[51:30] greater than any temptation that ever
[51:32] came your way. And what is in your
[51:34] heart? That's the main thing. What's in
[51:36] your heart? And I thought of that that
[51:39] uh uh man that came before brother
[51:41] Brennan. And and I I I said to these
[51:45] brothers right here where we were in the
[51:47] study. I said, "If this man came up to
[51:49] be prayed for, I doubt that any one of
[51:51] us would pray for him."
[51:54] And that and it really and I'm glad,
[51:57] brother Tim, that you picked it up and t
[51:59] and spoke on it. And brother Brown said,
[52:02] "You love Jesus."
[52:05] &gt;&gt; That was the key. You you love Jesus. If
[52:09] you had crossed the line, if you had
[52:10] blasphemed, if you had you were beyond
[52:14] forgiveness, you'd hate Jesus. But you
[52:16] love Jesus. And it took that uncovering
[52:19] and unveiling to bring that man to an
[52:22] acceptance of that. And then there was
[52:24] nothing impossible.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; And there I'm standing and brother Tim
[52:29] is taking the picture with him 62 years
[52:32] to the day.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; It was November the 8th and we were
[52:35] standing there on Sunday, November the
[52:37] 8th. 62 years to the day and the man is
[52:40] gloriously saved. WHAT WAS ACHIEVED AT
[52:43] that moment?
[52:45] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED? SURELY WE OUGHT
[52:47] TO SAY PRAISE GOD FOR HIM. PRAISE GOD.
[52:49] THAT THAT THAT THAT MAN HAS HAD 62 YEARS
[52:53] OF BLISS.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. 62 YEARS of the negative
[52:58] coming to the positive.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; And he took the book.
[53:05] And when the lamb took the book, I have
[53:08] just said, and this is the feeling of my
[53:10] heart this evening, which I'm going to
[53:12] be sharing with you very personally,
[53:14] heaven couldn't hold itself any longer.
[53:17] couldn't hold its silence any longer.
[53:20] The only one that came out of the bosom
[53:22] of the father had the solution to redeem
[53:26] the fallen attributes. There was he was
[53:28] the only one that could redeem the
[53:30] fallen attributes. And God's purpose was
[53:33] he's going to be he's going to be seated
[53:35] as a king in a kingdom and a subject's
[53:38] going to be gathered around him. Not
[53:40] going to be gathered in Bible way or any
[53:42] other message church or not going to be
[53:44] gathered any place. There may be people
[53:46] around there that you didn't dream were
[53:47] going to be there. But whoever was in
[53:50] his in his mind, whoever was in his
[53:53] attribute is going to be gathered. He's
[53:55] going to be gathered with his subjects
[53:57] &gt;&gt; by his grace. I want to be there
[54:00] &gt;&gt; by his grace. The prophet of God want to
[54:03] be something to be seated with the
[54:04] apostles and seated with the early
[54:07] church and seated with all those saints
[54:09] of the early years.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:14] And no wonder says to redeem the fallen
[54:17] attributes and turn the negatives into
[54:20] positives and to bring from darkness to
[54:23] light. And so the scripture tells us and
[54:26] he came and took the book out of the
[54:27] right hand of him that sat upon the
[54:29] throne. And when he had taken the book,
[54:32] your name in the book that was in the
[54:34] thoughts of God that was an attribute
[54:36] within his bosom and and and Christ came
[54:39] out and from him from that logos from
[54:42] that word that came out, he's going to
[54:45] allow that word to be revealed. He's
[54:47] going to allow that word to be spoken.
[54:49] Going to allow that word to uh call you
[54:52] to pick your heart. Hallelujah. And even
[54:55] those that was had their heart
[54:57] pricricked and said, "What men and
[54:59] brethren, what must we do to be saved?"
[55:01] Those whoever came, if they ever were
[55:04] there, they were there then.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; And listen. And when he took the book,
[55:10] and when he had taken the book, the four
[55:12] beasts and the four and 20 elders fell
[55:15] down before the lamb. That was some
[55:17] action. They fell down before the lamb,
[55:20] every one of them having harps and
[55:22] golden vials full of odors, which are
[55:24] the prayers of the saints. And they sung
[55:27] a new song, saying, "Thou art worthy."
[55:31] &gt;&gt; We sing a song, but we ought to, if we
[55:33] sing it after the service this evening,
[55:35] we ought to sing it as they sang it.
[55:37] Thou art worthy, oh God.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. TO RECEIVE HONOR AND TO
[55:42] RECEIVE POWER AND to receive glory. And
[55:45] if there's anything less than that in
[55:47] our hearts, we need another trip, maybe
[55:49] back to the altar or someplace to get
[55:52] alone with God. And they sung a new
[55:53] song. Thou art worthy to take the book
[55:56] and to open it there and to open the
[55:58] seals thereof. For thou was slain and
[56:01] and hast and and hast redeemed us back
[56:04] to God. Has redeemed us to God by thy
[56:07] blood out of every kindred and tongue
[56:10] and people and nations. How many nations
[56:12] do we have represented here? I don't
[56:15] know, maybe 30, 40, I don't know. It
[56:17] makes no difference. We are of one
[56:19] citizenship.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; We are citizens of one kingdom. There's
[56:24] only two that you can belong to. There's
[56:26] only two. There's a kingdom of darkness,
[56:29] a kingdom of evil, a kingdom of
[56:31] uncleanness, A KINGDOM OF CONFUSION. I
[56:34] THANK GOD WE'RE NOT PART OF THAT
[56:36] KINGDOM. I THANK GOD HE has called us
[56:39] into his glorious kingdom. AND WHAT A
[56:42] PROMISE. NOT ONLY A PROMISE, NOT A PIE
[56:44] IN THE SKY, A REALITY.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IF THIS ISN'T TRUE, FOLKS,
[56:50] we'll close the doors and all go out and
[56:53] and live life as best we can at this
[56:56] season. But I'm so glad that the Christ
[56:59] of Christmas, the that the world is
[57:02] celebrating, THEY THEY'RE ALL TAKEN UP
[57:04] WITH THEIR commercialization and we
[57:06] don't have to have any part of that.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE NO PART OF THAT. WE'RE SO GLAD
[57:11] THAT he came. Hallelujah. He came with
[57:14] the blood of God from the seed of God to
[57:18] redeem the attributes THAT WAS IN THE
[57:21] FATHER'S MIND. AND AND he says, I HAVE
[57:23] COMPLETED THE WORK that thou gavest me
[57:26] TO DO. I'VE SHED THE BLOOD. HALLELUJAH.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I I'm I have to hold myself back
[57:33] so I don't get into Sunday morning. And
[57:36] they sung a new song, saying, "Thou art
[57:38] worthy to take the book, and to open the
[57:40] seals thereof." Has he done it? That was
[57:43] him that opened the seals.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then he had a mouthpiece, an
[57:47] authorative, a an authorized mouthpiece
[57:51] here on earth to speak the things that
[57:54] were that were made open.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. and hath redeemed us to God by the
[57:58] blood out of every kindred and tongue
[58:01] and people and nation, and hath made us
[58:03] unto our God, kings and priests, and we
[58:07] shall reign on the earth. And I beheld,
[58:10] and I heard the voice of many angels
[58:12] round about, the throne, and the beasts,
[58:15] and the elders, and the number 10,000
[58:18] times, 10,000 and thousands of thousands
[58:22] saying with a loud voice. And I
[58:25] determined as I was reading this, it was
[58:27] impossible for me to whisper it. It's
[58:29] impossible. If I didn't have this
[58:31] microphone, I' i'd bearo before I left
[58:34] here because I determined I'm going to
[58:36] give him glory tonight. I I determined
[58:38] that we all shall give him glory. And
[58:41] though you may have never spoken and
[58:43] never opened your mouth, you'll open
[58:44] your mouth tonight AND JUST SAY, "GLORY
[58:47] TO GOD for what he has done." THAT THE
[58:50] LAMB HAS TAKEN THE BOOK TO CLAIM THE
[58:53] attributes that were in the father's
[58:56] mind. Hallelujah. AND WE'RE GOING TO BE
[58:59] GATHERED WITH HIM AROUND HIS THRONE IN
[59:03] this kingdom that we're now in that
[59:05] kingdom. You're in that kingdom.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; I'm authorized TO TELL YOU WHERE YOU
[59:11] ARE. YOU'RE NOT HERE in just Cloverdale
[59:13] Bible way. WE'RE IN A KINGDOM.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE A KING. IT HAS REGULATIONS and
[59:20] rules THAT'S FAR SUPERIOR TO any that
[59:23] are here on earth.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Saying with a loud voice, worthy is the
[59:28] lamb.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; That was slain. That was slain to
[59:33] receive power and riches and wisdom and
[59:38] strength and honor and glory and
[59:42] blessing and every creature which is in
[59:44] heaven and on earth. Are you a creature
[59:48] on earth and under the earth and such as
[59:50] are in the sea and all that are in them
[59:54] heard I saying blessing and honor and
[59:58] glory and power be unto him that siteth
[1:00:01] upon the throne and unto the Lamb
[1:00:04] forever and ever. Hallelujah. We say
[1:00:08] blessing and honor and power hallelujah
[1:00:13] to our God.
[1:00:16] There's none like him. And the four
[1:00:18] beasts, this didn't end. And the four
[1:00:20] beasts said, "Amen."
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; And the four and 20 elders fell down and
[1:00:24] worshiped him that liveth forever and
[1:00:26] ever. And then in Revelation 7 and 12,
[1:00:30] saying, "Amen.
[1:00:32] Blessing and glory and wisdom and
[1:00:36] thanksgiving and honor and power and
[1:00:39] might be unto our God forever and ever.
[1:00:44] Amen. Amen.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; You know, Revelation is full of that. Do
[1:00:47] you know why? It's the last book.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Because it's the revelation of Jesus
[1:00:52] Christ. WHO IS HE? HE'S THE SON.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE ONE THAT CAME FROM THE BOSOM.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; And he's being revealed.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, people don't know what this message
[1:01:04] is all about. This message is revealing
[1:01:07] him.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; How can we help but say something?
[1:01:15] In Revelation 19, "And after these
[1:01:17] things, I heard a great voice of much
[1:01:20] people in heaven saying, "Hallelujah!
[1:01:24] Salvation and glory and honor and power
[1:01:29] unto our Lord our God."
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what Revelation's all
[1:01:34] about. Revelation isn't some kind of
[1:01:37] dragged out book and all full of strange
[1:01:39] mysteries. Whatever it was, we know one
[1:01:43] thing. And they all in heaven and in the
[1:01:46] earth cried out, "Glory and honor and
[1:01:50] power and might and riches." Hallelujah.
[1:01:54] belongs to our God.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; And that's why we're gathered here.
[1:01:58] We're gathered here to worship him.
[1:02:00] We're gathered here not just to think
[1:02:02] about him. We're gathered here to
[1:02:03] worship him and to thank him and to give
[1:02:06] him his due worship.
[1:02:10] AND HE HAS TOLD US SO MANY THINGS about
[1:02:12] us.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Sometime we get, you know, we say, well,
[1:02:17] you know, we've heard so much of that
[1:02:20] we're we're almost
[1:02:22] uh, you know, we got in our psyche that
[1:02:25] uh,
[1:02:27] how is it
[1:02:30] less and lower esteem?
[1:02:32] We get such low esteem of ourselves.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; That's the devil's world. Right.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; God's world. That's a devil's kingdom.
[1:02:42] God's kingdom is you're my children.
[1:02:45] You're my sons. You're my daughters. Do
[1:02:48] you believe that? I thought of you
[1:02:50] before this world was. I thought of you
[1:02:52] before all of this scientific world are
[1:02:54] even even come about. I thought of you
[1:02:56] long before all the technical things you
[1:02:59] have that are so time uh you know time
[1:03:02] consuming
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; and supposed to be saving time.
[1:03:07] We won't get on of that.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; But I finally found a place and I I was
[1:03:11] rejoicing today. I just thought that's
[1:03:14] exactly what the people of God. We need
[1:03:18] to forget the world and forget all the
[1:03:20] activity and all the all the busyiness
[1:03:23] of the world and just take time. Uh
[1:03:27] there's a song of course uh I know that
[1:03:30] we sang. I I I'm I'm going to shout. I
[1:03:33] just feel like shouting. Hallelujah. And
[1:03:36] I thought of that course today.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to shout.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; All of us are going to shout.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, I didn't know I was
[1:03:49] going to shout." Yeah, you're going to
[1:03:51] shout. WE'RE GOING TO SHOUT, "GLORY,
[1:03:53] HALLELUJAH, and honor, and power, and
[1:03:57] glory belongth to him."
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Does it belong to him? Then we give it
[1:04:06] to him.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; And and and just when he took the book,
[1:04:13] it wasn't even open yet. When he took
[1:04:15] the book, THEY WERE JUST OVERCOME. THE
[1:04:17] ELDERS WERE OVERCOME. The angels were
[1:04:20] overcome.
[1:04:22] 420 elders were overcome. Just fell down
[1:04:25] at his feet.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, they they had
[1:04:28] some indication of what was in the book.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Here's a GROUP OF HERE'S THE
[1:04:35] attributes that were in the fall. Well,
[1:04:37] I better just carry on here for a
[1:04:39] moment.
[1:04:43] Hallelujah. You know, when you spend
[1:04:45] some time and you spend uh two three
[1:04:48] days and you just ponder these things,
[1:04:50] you just see them and you you you can't
[1:04:52] help but
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; be I won't say overcome, but you are
[1:04:57] they overcome any other thoughts of the
[1:04:59] of life.
[1:05:05] heard a great voice of much people in
[1:05:08] heaven saying hallelujah and salvation
[1:05:10] and glory and honor and power unto the
[1:05:14] Lord our God.
[1:05:18] In Matthew, Jesus said and he told of
[1:05:21] the of the swer and the of the swer and
[1:05:24] the seed and the field is the world and
[1:05:27] the good seed are the children of the
[1:05:32] kingdom.
[1:05:34] This kingdom has children.
[1:05:37] This children this kingdom has subjects
[1:05:41] but the tears are the children of the
[1:05:43] wicked one.
[1:05:45] in Revelation 3 and 21 said to him that
[1:05:47] overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me
[1:05:51] in my throne. Brother Brandham makes a
[1:05:55] special point of that even also even as
[1:05:59] I also overcame and am sat down with my
[1:06:03] father in his throne.
[1:06:08] He says, "Set sit with me in my throne.
[1:06:11] Not on my throne, in my throne." That's
[1:06:15] in his domain. And now, as Christ is the
[1:06:19] ruler, throne, ruler at this time, and
[1:06:23] this is how how can I overcome
[1:06:26] the complete domain of God. So will the
[1:06:30] church be with him and the bride be with
[1:06:33] him in his throne in his entire domain
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; where his domain reaches. A throne is
[1:06:41] over a domain and a domain reaches just
[1:06:44] as far as it is bound as its boundaries
[1:06:47] do. And this is from eternity to
[1:06:51] eternity.
[1:06:53] Hello folks that are still in the
[1:06:55] negative, but you have ears to hear and
[1:06:58] a mind to understand and a mouth to
[1:07:00] speak. Glory to God who made this kind
[1:07:03] of a promise and I just happen to
[1:07:05] believe it tonight.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; I accept it tonight.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; If I don't accept that, what do we have
[1:07:12] to accept?
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; You want to have to accept the newspaper
[1:07:15] or the news tonight? I can tell you that
[1:07:17] the news will be uh same things just
[1:07:20] different people.
[1:07:23] Same violence and same disasters just
[1:07:26] different people.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Or you can believe this.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Kingdom of God.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Kingdom of God has come.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Hello children of the kingdom.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Not children not not of the tears of the
[1:07:42] wicked one but children of the kingdom.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Christ didn't come to make us church
[1:07:47] members.
[1:07:48] Christ didn't come to just give us a a
[1:07:51] comfortable social activity or social
[1:07:54] interaction. That's not what he came
[1:07:56] for. He came TO REDEEM US BACK TO GOD.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; And angels can't restrain themselves
[1:08:03] when they see that. When they see the
[1:08:05] glory OF OF PEOPLE THAT WERE SO LOST AND
[1:08:10] SO uh uh
[1:08:13] distant from God, so fallen.
[1:08:16] I'm going to come into that in just a
[1:08:18] moment.
[1:08:20] And we are his kingdom and his domain.
[1:08:24] This is in the raising of Gyrus's
[1:08:26] daughter. And we are his kingdom and his
[1:08:29] domain is from eternity to eternity.
[1:08:32] Think of that. All powers and every word
[1:08:37] is given unto into his hand. That's
[1:08:40] right. How wonderful. Hebrews 10:1 says,
[1:08:44] "For the law having a shadow of good
[1:08:47] things to come." Here we are. Thank you.
[1:08:53] For the law having a shadow. Maybe we
[1:08:55] could just dim the lights a little wee
[1:08:57] bit. Not much, but a little bit.
[1:09:01] Having a shadow of things to come and
[1:09:03] not the very image of the things. can
[1:09:06] never with those sacrifices which they
[1:09:09] offered year by year continually make
[1:09:12] the the comers there unto perfect. In
[1:09:15] the message perfection,
[1:09:17] uh, brother Brandham refers to Hebrews
[1:09:19] 11. It's all about, he said, it's all
[1:09:23] that wonderful shadows of the faith, the
[1:09:27] heroes of the faith. Hebrews 11th
[1:09:30] chapter, you know, by faith this
[1:09:32] happened. By faith, Abel. By faith,
[1:09:34] Enoch was translated. By faith, Abraham.
[1:09:37] By faith, Sarah received strength to
[1:09:40] conceive. And what shall we say more
[1:09:42] about all these people? And the prophet
[1:09:44] simply says that in uh in the it's about
[1:09:49] the wonderful shadows of the faith.
[1:09:53] Shadows of the faith. The heroes of
[1:09:56] faith. How by faith they did such and
[1:09:59] such a thing. and how without us. And
[1:10:03] how without us they
[1:10:06] could not be made perfect because they
[1:10:10] are the shadow of this to come.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Do we believe that? THOSE GREAT HEROES
[1:10:18] OF FAITH GO HOME AND READ THE 11TH
[1:10:20] CHAPTER AND SAY THESE MEN OF GOD, THESE
[1:10:24] WOMEN OF GOD, THESE STALARTS OF FAITH,
[1:10:27] THESE SEERS OF GOD, THESE PATRIARCHS,
[1:10:30] THEY LIVE THEIR LIFE, THEY HAVE THEIR
[1:10:32] TROUBLES AND DIFFICULTIES LIKE WE DO.
[1:10:34] But they could not be made COMPLETE OR
[1:10:37] BE MADE PERFECT without us.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; They had to have this final age.
[1:10:42] Hallelujah. This final AGE WOULD HAVE AN
[1:10:44] AGE. GOD COULDN'T HOLD ALL THESE THINGS
[1:10:46] SECRET. SO, HE BURST THE THINGS OPEN.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; He broke the seals and had a and he and
[1:10:53] he did it at a time that he had had a a
[1:10:56] messenger on earth that he had spoken to
[1:10:58] since he was a child that he had come
[1:11:01] and BEGAN TO DEMONSTRATE THE power of
[1:11:04] God and that crippled child uh leaping
[1:11:07] out of his arms and the bones
[1:11:10] straightening out. Such dramatic things.
[1:11:12] Oh, we'd like to see those things. I CAN
[1:11:15] TELL YOU THAT THOSE THOSE miracles don't
[1:11:18] transform you. They may excite you. They
[1:11:21] may BRING TEARS TO YOUR EYES, BUT THEY
[1:11:23] DON'T TRANSFORM YOU. This word, if you
[1:11:26] understand, this word came OUT OF THE
[1:11:28] BOSOM OF THE FATHER. THE LOGOS WAS SENT
[1:11:32] TRANSFORM the people. Change them.
[1:11:35] Change them from the negative to the
[1:11:37] positive. CHANGE THEM FROM DARKNESS INTO
[1:11:40] LIGHT. THEY MUST BE THE CHILDREN OF
[1:11:42] LIGHT. THEY'RE THE CHILDREN OF THE DAY.
[1:11:44] THEY CAN'T JUST SIT AND BE CHURCH
[1:11:46] MEMBERS. Change them from BEING JUST
[1:11:49] CHURCH MEMBERS. CHANGE THEM FROM BEING
[1:11:51] JUST A SOCIALIZING GROUP OF PEOPLE.
[1:11:54] CHANGE THEM UNTIL THEY REALIZE I'M A SON
[1:11:58] OF GOD.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, Lord.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Shadows of the faith and heroes of
[1:12:12] faith. How by faith they did such and
[1:12:15] such a thing and how without us they
[1:12:18] could not be made perfect because they
[1:12:21] are of the shadow of this to come.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:29] These shadows of the faith were the
[1:12:32] negatives to the positive. Amen.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; The 13th chapter ends up with this
[1:12:40] towards the end that Jesus Christ is all
[1:12:42] in all. That he's the same yesterday,
[1:12:45] today, and forever. Showing that it was
[1:12:47] Christ back there. It was Christ back
[1:12:51] before the law. It was Christ in the
[1:12:54] law. It was Christ in the days of grace.
[1:12:58] It'll be Christ forever. Jesus Christ
[1:13:01] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:13:03] Do you see where he's going with that
[1:13:04] phrase?
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; It's eternity.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; What a beautiful picture the Hebrew
[1:13:13] letter paints for us.
[1:13:17] Before the world was ever formed, we
[1:13:20] were placed in Christ or we were placed
[1:13:23] in the revelation of the son of man.
[1:13:27] Listen friends,
[1:13:29] you did not come here by accident.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. You were born in this season and
[1:13:34] of God sent his word and called you. You
[1:13:37] were called for one purpose that you
[1:13:39] could hear this revelation which of is a
[1:13:43] revelation of the son of man because
[1:13:45] this one that came from the bosom of God
[1:13:47] when he's glorified when he's when he's
[1:13:50] revealed to the people and WHEN WE SAY
[1:13:53] OH JESUS MY SAVIOR WE'RE GIVING glory to
[1:13:56] God who SENT HIM TO BE our redeemer.
[1:13:59] Amen.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not to be a name on our lips,
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; but to be a reality in our hearts,
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; before the world was ever formed, we
[1:14:10] were placed in Christ or placed in the
[1:14:13] revelation of the son of man.
[1:14:17] Brother Brandham said
[1:14:20] in the unveiling of God, he's the son of
[1:14:23] man as prophet
[1:14:25] that he's the son of God because God's a
[1:14:28] spirit. He's a son of God in the age of
[1:14:30] the Holy Spirit.
[1:14:33] The age of the Holy Spirit. And then he
[1:14:36] becomes the son of David to the Jews.
[1:14:40] But he said between there
[1:14:43] between. And that's an important
[1:14:45] sentence between. In that little sliver
[1:14:47] of space he becomes a son of man.
[1:14:53] We're in that sliver.
[1:14:56] We're just that little sliver of space
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; where God says, "All right, the earth
[1:15:01] has gone through its birth pains
[1:15:03] [snorts]
[1:15:04] and science is developing into a very
[1:15:08] very cultivated and sophisticated
[1:15:11] and bringing forth a people and Satan's
[1:15:15] Eden is coming to its height." And in
[1:15:19] the midst of in the midst of God's Eden,
[1:15:21] Satan crept in. In the midst of Satan's
[1:15:24] Eden, God came.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; I say glory.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to his wisdom.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; He knows how to creep in. He knows how
[1:15:36] to come in secretly and reveal himself
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; when you were in sin. He knew how to
[1:15:44] come in.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:52] You know folks, we have to believe in
[1:15:54] the supernatural because the
[1:15:55] supernatural is everywhere.
[1:16:08] God being infinite who cannot lie,
[1:16:11] cannot speak anything contrary, knows
[1:16:14] everything, just as perfect at the
[1:16:16] beginning as he is at the ending and
[1:16:19] just as perfect at the end as he was at
[1:16:21] the beginning. Isn't that nice? God is
[1:16:24] endless like eternity. You can never
[1:16:27] find a corner of a perfect circle. You
[1:16:30] could run and run through ages and
[1:16:32] eternity and there'd never never never
[1:16:35] be an end to it. And that's the way God
[1:16:38] is.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; But he loved fatherhood.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Ben says he was alone with his
[1:16:48] thoughts.
[1:16:50] Prophet says he was lonesome.
[1:16:54] And I want you to see something, class,
[1:16:57] because I just feel like it's that way
[1:16:59] tonight.
[1:17:02] Here's here's here's God.
[1:17:06] And you've got to see him in his
[1:17:07] greatness and his omnipotence and in his
[1:17:11] filling all space and time with that
[1:17:14] attribute and that desire. I want to be
[1:17:17] expressed.
[1:17:19] I want to be made known.
[1:17:21] I want to have sons and daughters. I
[1:17:24] want to have a family. That's what I
[1:17:26] want to have.
[1:17:29] And back in the back part of God's mind,
[1:17:32] he says, "I I'll I'll
[1:17:35] Satan, his enemy, came in and the fall
[1:17:38] happened, and I'll read it for you." And
[1:17:41] then time had to come into existence
[1:17:44] because of that. And and and I'll read
[1:17:47] it also for you. And there came a little
[1:17:50] he says the circle is eternity but
[1:17:52] there's a little he said my wife calls
[1:17:54] it a hickey but it's like a loop comes
[1:17:57] down and breaks that eternity but he
[1:18:00] says eternity kept on going and we just
[1:18:03] fall down into this the fall into this
[1:18:07] little loop.
[1:18:09] And then he says when that's over then
[1:18:11] we just continue on
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; with it. [sighs]
[1:18:16] And when it went went down into that
[1:18:18] little loop,
[1:18:21] that's a negative part.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; That's a negative part. We're in a
[1:18:26] negative part for a short season, a
[1:18:29] little time. You're in a negative right
[1:18:31] now.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; And yes, there'll be trials. And yes,
[1:18:35] there'll be all of these things.
[1:18:38] And it'll either be by death or by the
[1:18:40] change. But he calls it the acid of
[1:18:42] death. In that one one place he calls it
[1:18:46] the acid of death because it is but he
[1:18:48] said and I'm so thankful for the way he
[1:18:51] put it the acid of death but he said all
[1:18:54] it can do is develop the picture
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; of what this God our great father had in
[1:19:00] his mind what he saw you he saw you the
[1:19:04] shape how you're made up he saw every
[1:19:06] part he saw your weakness he saw your
[1:19:09] strengths he saw he doesn't need a
[1:19:11] psychologist God is All wise,
[1:19:14] hallelujah.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; I feel like giving him praise.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Feel like shouting hallelujah.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But what he wanted to do,
[1:19:26] he loved fatherhood. In him, he loved
[1:19:29] fatherhood.
[1:19:31] He was a father. The prophet said he was
[1:19:34] a father, but there was no son. So out
[1:19:36] of his bosom came this little halo
[1:19:40] light. It was the logos. It was his
[1:19:43] word. He was going to give some uh uh
[1:19:46] give some materialization.
[1:19:48] He wanted to be have he wanted to be
[1:19:50] somebody that could be touched, that
[1:19:52] could be felt.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; That could be understood.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the king came down to
[1:19:58] dwell with his subjects to be touched by
[1:20:01] his subjects to be to have compassion on
[1:20:04] their need.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he wanted to do he loved
[1:20:08] fatherhood for he was a father. And the
[1:20:11] only way I'd like everybody to say the
[1:20:14] only way
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; I want to want you to say it louder. The
[1:20:18] only way the only way that he could
[1:20:22] express it was to become a son of man.
[1:20:25] That's who Jesus is.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; He's the only way.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; And what did he do when he came? I saw
[1:20:33] some smiling already. He comes AND HE
[1:20:36] SAYS, "I AM THE WAY."
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; He's the only way.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; The only way that the father
[1:20:46] could be a father.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; That's why he said I mean you'll you'll
[1:20:54] read the Bible entirely different.
[1:20:56] That's why he said I DO WHAT THE father
[1:20:58] shows me.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; I don't do anything till the father
[1:21:02] shows me. He was so directed, so under
[1:21:07] the desire and the purpose of the
[1:21:10] father. And if Jesus was that, how much
[1:21:13] more we want to be that father, thy will
[1:21:16] be done
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; on earth as it is in heaven.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; And the only way he could express it was
[1:21:25] to become a son of man. You say, "Well,
[1:21:27] you read that last week. I'll be reading
[1:21:29] it probably again.
[1:21:31] I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[1:21:34] No man cometh unto who? Father.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; The father.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; But by me. Why? Because you were in him.
[1:21:42] That's the only way to come to the
[1:21:44] father.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Now this great chain of perfection was
[1:21:54] broken. I have I have for space to try
[1:21:58] to get it on a slide. I've taken out
[1:22:00] some words or a line or two here and
[1:22:02] there. Uh now this great chain of
[1:22:06] perfection was broken by time space.
[1:22:10] Time came because of sin.
[1:22:14] Let's draw a picture of time. A perfect
[1:22:17] circle forever forever and then all of
[1:22:21] all of
[1:22:23] sin dropped in and put a little drop.
[1:22:27] Brother Brandham says, "My wife calls it
[1:22:28] a hickey
[1:22:30] uh drop in the chain." So, it comes
[1:22:33] down. Now, eternity continues on, but
[1:22:37] it's not in its perfect condition.
[1:22:39] There's a little gap comes down, breaks
[1:22:43] over this way, goes out this way. God
[1:22:47] had to do that because Satan caused it
[1:22:50] and it dropped down to a space of time
[1:22:53] for the trying and the perfecting and
[1:22:57] for the purging of the lost. Listen, I
[1:22:59] just want to drop in here for a moment.
[1:23:01] Brother Brandham says one place, "And
[1:23:03] when the trying of the word is over,
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; it's not God saying go and grind them
[1:23:10] out. Go and grind these humans out."
[1:23:12] It's not that. It's God's word that's
[1:23:15] being tried. And you are you are
[1:23:18] declaring I've been birthed by the word
[1:23:21] of God. My faith is in the promise of
[1:23:24] God. It is yay and amen to everyone that
[1:23:27] believeth. And and because of that
[1:23:29] confession, you become the subject. You
[1:23:31] become the object of all of the all the
[1:23:34] darts and all the uh arrows and so on of
[1:23:38] Satan.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; He's trying you
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; whether you're going to doubt it or
[1:23:43] believe it.
[1:23:47] I'm not here, friends, to, you know, to
[1:23:50] get some metal. I'm here to be with you.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; I'm here because I believe this.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking because I believe it.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; And God had to do it because Satan
[1:24:04] caused it. and it dropped down to a
[1:24:07] space of time for the trying and the
[1:24:10] perfecting and for the purging of the
[1:24:13] lost that God by his sovereign grace
[1:24:16] might someday lift that little hickey or
[1:24:19] gap back into the perfect circle. Then
[1:24:23] she rolls on just the same.
[1:24:27] A gap is a chasm. There's a great chasm
[1:24:32] fixed.
[1:24:37] time. Now, time is this little loop that
[1:24:40] loops down. Jesus was from eternity to
[1:24:43] eternity, but he stepped into the time
[1:24:46] spaces made flesh and came through here
[1:24:50] in order to sanctify or put a streak of
[1:24:53] blood all across this place to redeem it
[1:24:57] and connect it back with God again.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:03] I hope you get that
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; in order to sanctify or put a streak of
[1:25:08] blood. Aren't you glad that there's a
[1:25:11] streak of blood?
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I just give you very
[1:25:16] very quickly uh in the back of
[1:25:21] my own testimony.
[1:25:24] I won't bother saying where or when, but
[1:25:26] in my own ministry time, there was a a
[1:25:32] person that was terribly demonpossessed.
[1:25:36] And uh and there was some men gathered
[1:25:39] around to pray for her. She had
[1:25:41] supernatural strength. Absolutely
[1:25:44] supernatural strength. Took some great
[1:25:47] big men, about three or four of them, to
[1:25:50] hold her.
[1:25:52] And don't fool around with devil's
[1:25:55] kingdom.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; His plan for the lost and the
[1:25:58] unbelieving is not a good one.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Dark will get more dark.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; The wages of sin is death.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; And the way of the transgressor is hard.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; There's no way to make it easy. The way
[1:26:13] of the transgressor is hard. Can I hear
[1:26:16] an amen to that?
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:26:20] And this woman, they were holding her
[1:26:23] down on the platform
[1:26:26] and she spoke. She spoke several times
[1:26:30] and I was right there.
[1:26:33] And
[1:26:35] she said, "If I come out, I'll just come
[1:26:38] into you."
[1:26:40] And uh the one brother said, "But you
[1:26:42] can't because there's a there's blood
[1:26:45] between you and I." And she just almost
[1:26:48] hissing and spitting and said, "Oh, why
[1:26:51] did you say that? Why did you say that?"
[1:26:53] Those demons know exactly all about the
[1:26:55] blood. You want to be thankful for the
[1:26:57] blood. You want to be thankful for that
[1:26:59] streak of blood that comes across. You
[1:27:02] can go to bed tonight and say, "I thank
[1:27:04] God
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; the devil's defeated.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; HE WAS DEFEATED at Calvary.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; And when THAT BLOOD CAME, WHEN THAT
[1:27:13] BLOOD WAS SHED, it was shed for me."
[1:27:16] HALLELUJAH. AND IT'S NEVER LOST ITS
[1:27:18] POWER.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; THAT'S not merely a song. That's an
[1:27:21] inspiration.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; The blood of God has never lost its
[1:27:25] power. We've been redeemed by love
[1:27:27] divine and by the blood of God.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the purpose of it come
[1:27:36] through the streak of blood all across
[1:27:38] this place to redeem it and connect it
[1:27:43] back with God again. because that's in
[1:27:46] another form. You were you were an
[1:27:49] attribute. You were in God's thought.
[1:27:53] God didn't think just think of people as
[1:27:55] a big lump of clay or big lump of dirt
[1:27:58] or an individual as just a lump of clay,
[1:28:01] but he thought of of who you are and
[1:28:04] what you would contribute and what you
[1:28:06] would be in the kingdom of God.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; What is the what is the bride of JESUS
[1:28:11] CHRIST CALLED? THE body
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. Do you think for a
[1:28:16] moment God who s who had the Elohim who
[1:28:21] had the out of his bosom
[1:28:25] came the son of man? Do you think for a
[1:28:28] moment he's going to belittle that? He's
[1:28:30] it's he he's glorified and worshiped
[1:28:34] because of that
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; because of what Jesus accomplished at
[1:28:37] Calvary.
[1:28:41] Amen.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; I just have to hold back.
[1:28:45] So, we're back. We're back with God
[1:28:49] again for all eternity. You see it? And
[1:28:53] that's all time is.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. You can turn the lights
[1:29:02] back on if you don't mind.
[1:29:06] [clears throat]
[1:29:21] Satan took Jesus up. And this is the
[1:29:24] testimony of raising a dead boy.
[1:29:27] And incidentally,
[1:29:29] I don't know if I would have the
[1:29:31] opportunity, but I'm working towards
[1:29:34] having the young men over to the home.
[1:29:37] We're working on that. We've been and uh
[1:29:43] for example, you know, brother Brennan
[1:29:46] told me in detail
[1:29:48] of the boy being raised from the dead in
[1:29:50] Finland.
[1:29:52] And you may or may not know there was
[1:29:54] two boys
[1:29:55] and one was terribly injured and one was
[1:29:59] killed.
[1:30:00] And the injured boy, his mother was at
[1:30:04] the bottom of the stairs when he would
[1:30:06] come out off the platform and she just
[1:30:09] like would grab a hold of him. Please,
[1:30:11] please, you raised the other boy. He
[1:30:13] said, "No, I did not raise that boy. God
[1:30:16] raised the boy. No, please, please, you
[1:30:18] you raised him." and and for my son for
[1:30:21] my son have a vision for my son and he
[1:30:24] tried to explain to her that he just
[1:30:26] couldn't have it. It would have to be
[1:30:28] God. But he told me that he was in the
[1:30:31] in his hotel. He was standing at the
[1:30:34] window looking out the window and he saw
[1:30:36] a vase with two liies and one was
[1:30:40] standing up perfect and correct and the
[1:30:43] other one was bent right over and
[1:30:45] sagging down like that. He says, "And
[1:30:47] while he looked, the one that was
[1:30:49] hanging down came right up and stood
[1:30:51] with this one and he said, "Call the
[1:30:53] woman."
[1:30:54] Hallelujah.
[1:30:56] That's the kind of confidence. That's
[1:30:58] the kind of God we serve. And we say,
[1:31:01] "Honor and power. Hallelujah. And glory
[1:31:05] and wisdom and all riches belong to
[1:31:08] him." Oh, how rich is our God. How
[1:31:11] powerful is our God. And the people of
[1:31:14] the Lord say so.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not just here to inspire you.
[1:31:24] You inspire me.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [laughter]
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; You shout it out. That'll be fine with
[1:31:29] me. I just hear I just here want to hear
[1:31:33] someone say, "Glory,
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; glory."
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; We honor and we worship him.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T NEED TO EXCITE ME. THAT
[1:31:42] DOESN'T EXCITE ME, BUT THAT I just want
[1:31:44] to join with you. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't do enough of it.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; You won't scare me.
[1:32:03] [clears throat]
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Call the woman." And that
[1:32:08] other boy was [snorts]
[1:32:10] I don't know just exactly what happened.
[1:32:13] I don't know what his injuries were,
[1:32:16] but [clears throat] I will tell you this
[1:32:17] also.
[1:32:19] You ready?
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Okay. [clears throat] We we we were just
[1:32:26] having meetings in Helsinki.
[1:32:29] It was just a very very you know small
[1:32:33] group of people maybe 60 70 80 people
[1:32:37] and they were the they were the
[1:32:39] believers in Helsinki Finland and
[1:32:42] brother Matty Honen he's a voice of God
[1:32:44] rep at least he was but he wasn't at
[1:32:47] that time and he always would go uh come
[1:32:50] down about 200 kilometers and arrange
[1:32:52] the meetings for us. Sometimes brother
[1:32:54] Lonnie Jenkins was there and other times
[1:32:57] just my wife and I were there and it's
[1:32:59] not easy. You know, it isn't easy. Uh we
[1:33:02] arrived and we were there and we had all
[1:33:04] a jet lag and everything else and we got
[1:33:06] to go to a meeting and I was did you go
[1:33:09] down the street or did somebody else go
[1:33:11] down? I think my wife went down to a
[1:33:13] restaurant and got some real strong
[1:33:16] coffee. And when you go to Europe, it's
[1:33:18] strong to begin with,
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; isn't it, Brother Hugh? But she said she
[1:33:22] wanted strong coffee and it was kind of
[1:33:24] lukewarm and you know uh
[1:33:29] coffee you could you could feel it
[1:33:34] and she thought well I need to I need to
[1:33:37] be awake for this meeting. So she drank
[1:33:39] the whole thing down. It wasn't very
[1:33:41] good.
[1:33:44] But we're in that meeting and do you
[1:33:45] know who's in that meeting? An elderly
[1:33:47] lady who who who knows about her? Not
[1:33:50] very many. Nobody knows about her. But
[1:33:53] she goes visiting and she goes to a
[1:33:55] senior citizen's home to visit another
[1:33:58] lady. And another woman who was also
[1:34:02] visiting came over and and said to this
[1:34:05] lady said, "Uh, excuse me. It seems that
[1:34:09] I know you." And this sister said, "I I
[1:34:12] don't I don't know you. I don't
[1:34:14] recognize you." No, she said, "It seems
[1:34:16] that." And this so they begin to ask
[1:34:19] questions about you know where are you
[1:34:20] from or and and so one was in Helsinki
[1:34:24] and I don't know where the other one was
[1:34:26] from exactly
[1:34:28] but she as they spoke together then as
[1:34:31] they spoke together they realized that
[1:34:34] they did had known each other years ago
[1:34:37] and a woman and then they then the
[1:34:39] conversation turned spiritual and
[1:34:42] [clears throat] uh so uh she said well
[1:34:45] where do you where do you fellowship
[1:34:46] ship. Well, I fellowship at a with a
[1:34:48] Pentecostal group and so on. Where do
[1:34:51] you fellowship? Said, "Well, I
[1:34:52] fellowship with a small group of people
[1:34:55] that fellowship around the message that
[1:34:58] Brother Brandham that God gave through
[1:34:59] brother Brandham." And this lady said,
[1:35:02] "Oh, Brother Brham."
[1:35:05] She said, "Do you remember when he was
[1:35:08] here?" "Oh, yes." Said, "I do." "Do you
[1:35:12] remember the boy that was raised from
[1:35:14] the dead?" Oh, yes. Yes. She said it was
[1:35:17] my husband that drove the car that
[1:35:20] killed the boy.
[1:35:23] How do you like that? You talk about a
[1:35:25] network, friends.
[1:35:28] And if you ever relate that, you can say
[1:35:30] I can I heard the man tell the account
[1:35:34] with my own I I He wasn't an eyewitness
[1:35:38] to the accident, but he was an
[1:35:40] eyewitness to the woman whose husband
[1:35:43] drove the car.
[1:35:44] So there you have it.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; You talk about true, you talk about
[1:35:48] infallible. I tell you what, friends,
[1:35:51] this ministry was the ministry of Jesus
[1:35:54] Christ,
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; the son of man.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; This ministry was one that God looked
[1:36:00] upon and loved because he saw he saw out
[1:36:03] of this ministry, not not the
[1:36:06] multitudes, but perhaps out of the
[1:36:08] multitudes will come a group of people.
[1:36:10] They will hear what my thoughts were and
[1:36:13] they will love my thoughts.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; They will love it because they are my
[1:36:18] thoughts. They and they will learn they
[1:36:20] are THE ATTRIBUTES ARE WHAT I FELT. MY
[1:36:23] THE ATTRIBUTE isn't just some word. The
[1:36:25] attribute just isn't a person. The
[1:36:28] attribute isn't just your visage. The
[1:36:30] attribute is who you are
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; as a son or daughter of God. and not
[1:36:36] only who you are, BUT WHO YOU CAN BE AND
[1:36:39] WHO YOU SHALL be because he's not done
[1:36:42] working on us.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. HE HE'S GOING TO COMPLETE
[1:36:46] IT, FRIENDS.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; YES, he is. HE'S GOING TO COMPLETE IT.
[1:36:49] YOU LEAVE IT IN HIS HANDS. YOU LEAVE
[1:36:52] YOURSELF IN HIS HANDS, and he'll do the
[1:36:54] work.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Because he said, "I do that which
[1:36:59] pleases the father." And that's what the
[1:37:01] father had in his mind. Hallelujah. He's
[1:37:04] not going to have a whole bunch of
[1:37:06] pieces and say, "Well, you know, these
[1:37:08] are just pieces of my attributes.
[1:37:12] You're quiet.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; He's not going to be there with pieces
[1:37:16] of his attributes. You're going to You
[1:37:19] are his finished work."
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, that sounds too
[1:37:24] wonderful." It's not too wonderful. Just
[1:37:27] believe it.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; And this is actually this whole this
[1:37:40] whole paragraph and then I'm going to be
[1:37:43] closing. It's 10 after 9.
[1:37:47] But he says
[1:37:50] in the testimony of raising the dead boy
[1:37:53] said Satan took Jesus up showed him
[1:37:56] every kingdom of the world and he said
[1:37:59] all these are mine. Satan did said,
[1:38:02] "I'll do with them what I'll do." He
[1:38:05] said, "What I want to." And said, "I'll
[1:38:08] give them to you if you'll fall down and
[1:38:11] worship me." Jesus knew that he was
[1:38:15] going to fall heir to them anyhow.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; And he said, "In my if my kingdom were
[1:38:20] of this world, I'd call my subjects and
[1:38:23] they'd fight. But my kingdom is is of
[1:38:26] above." See, but blessed are the pure in
[1:38:29] heart, for they shall see God. Blessed
[1:38:31] are the meek, for they shall inherit the
[1:38:34] earth. And then this is the line I have
[1:38:36] highlighted. Someday Jesus will come to
[1:38:39] the earth. And the dead that's dead in
[1:38:42] him shall rise and come forth with him,
[1:38:45] and he is the king. We're now candidates
[1:38:49] and his subjects in his kingdom.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; We're now candidates. You know, friends,
[1:38:57] the prophet of God said it because he
[1:38:59] had to say it. He had to say things that
[1:39:02] were almost unbelievable for us humans.
[1:39:06] And this depends what side of the what
[1:39:09] side of the road you're trying to
[1:39:10] understand it.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; If if you simply say he came, this
[1:39:15] messenger came so that I could believe.
[1:39:19] This messenger came so he could speak
[1:39:22] things that were beyond my
[1:39:24] understanding. This messenger came to
[1:39:27] speak things that are so glorious, it's
[1:39:30] just beyond my grasp. BUT HE SAYS IT AND
[1:39:33] I'M GOING TO believe it.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; And if HE SAYS WE'RE NOW CANDIDATES and
[1:39:39] his subjects in his kingdom and we shall
[1:39:42] return to the earth someday to be
[1:39:46] immortal beings. And if he said that we
[1:39:49] have eternal life now and we're going
[1:39:52] then then I think it's a big mistake if
[1:39:54] we don't confess it.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; And the more you confess it,
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; the more you'll see it taking place,
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; you'll take a grip in your life and
[1:40:03] you'll see that you you begin to look at
[1:40:05] things differently.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Hello. You begin to see things
[1:40:09] differently. You look at things
[1:40:10] differently and THE IMPOSSIBLE BECOME
[1:40:13] POSSIBLE. the things that you questioned
[1:40:16] become believable.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; And then I want to end here because I
[1:40:26] want to say that Jesus went through the
[1:40:29] process
[1:40:31] and the acid of death
[1:40:34] for us.
[1:40:41] showing himself alive again.
[1:40:46] And I will give you just
[1:40:50] a clue where I want to go
[1:40:54] on the Lord's day a Sunday morning. And
[1:40:57] the scripture says, "To whom also he
[1:40:59] showed himself alive
[1:41:01] after his passion
[1:41:04] by many infallible proofs,
[1:41:07] being seen of them 40 days and speaking
[1:41:11] of the things pertaining to the kingdom
[1:41:14] of God."
[1:41:17] I don't think there was perhaps no one
[1:41:19] here was in the meetings.
[1:41:22] Was
[1:41:23] anyone here in Brother Benham's
[1:41:25] meetings?
[1:41:28] I was in about 30 of the meetings. My
[1:41:31] wife was in
[1:41:34] some of the meetings.
[1:41:40] None of that contributed to why I'm
[1:41:43] here.
[1:41:47] What I'm really saying is that you
[1:41:49] didn't need to be in those great
[1:41:52] meetings.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; It was not those miracles that caught
[1:41:57] you.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; It was this word of quad that caught
[1:42:02] you.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; God was not thrilled that multitudes
[1:42:09] came to Jesus and left him.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; That didn't thrill him. He was not
[1:42:13] thrilled that hundreds of thousands came
[1:42:15] to hear William Brham and where are they
[1:42:18] today? Most all of them gone. But what
[1:42:21] he's thrilled at, here's a group of
[1:42:23] people. Hear my word. Hear this logos.
[1:42:27] This that came out of my bosom.
[1:42:30] Hallelujah. And they believe on him.
[1:42:32] They believe on his sacrifice. And
[1:42:35] because they've believed, I have I I I
[1:42:37] have called them my sons, my children,
[1:42:40] my daughters, my family.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; And Jesus went through the process of
[1:42:50] death showing himself alive again. And
[1:42:54] so here will be the clue for you.
[1:43:00] He came and lived
[1:43:02] in the negative form.
[1:43:06] Brother Random said he was tempted. The
[1:43:07] scripture says he was tempted in all
[1:43:09] points like we are.
[1:43:12] Tempted in all points. I may not
[1:43:14] understand that's what he says. He was
[1:43:16] tempted in all points like we are.
[1:43:20] When he was thirsty, he needed water.
[1:43:24] When he was hungry, he needed food.
[1:43:28] He was in a
[1:43:31] when they stuck him with a spear, he
[1:43:33] bled. They put a crown of thorns. They
[1:43:37] pulled his beard out, spat in his face,
[1:43:40] did did all those things. They said, the
[1:43:42] Bible says that he his visage
[1:43:46] was marred more than that of any man.
[1:43:50] And they've had they've, you know,
[1:43:51] Hollywood has tried to produce it and so
[1:43:53] on and make millions perhaps on it. I
[1:43:55] don't know. And I don't care what they
[1:43:56] do.
[1:43:57] and call it the passion. Whatever more
[1:44:00] that passion was for us.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; That whole scene was for us.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; It was your savior.
[1:44:10] It was this invisible God
[1:44:15] created that seed and had a little girl
[1:44:18] Mary believe him
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; and she gave birth to a son and he
[1:44:22] became the son of God
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; and we were in him
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; and through him I'll bring many sons to
[1:44:31] redemption. I'll bring a family. I'll
[1:44:34] gather them. And that's why it caught
[1:44:36] you. Hallelujah.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; And Jesus now I'm going to go to Luke 24
[1:44:41] once again. He's out and he's walking
[1:44:44] with
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; two on the way to Emmas [snorts] and
[1:44:49] they're still in the negative and he's
[1:44:52] in the positive.
[1:45:00] [laughter]
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; And so the positive you talk about how
[1:45:04] close can he come, how close can he get
[1:45:05] to you. You can actually hear from the
[1:45:08] positive side.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; And that's why a prophet comes and says,
[1:45:12] "You're hearing from your
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; theophony."
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Where's your theophony?
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; It's somewhere where you you can't feel
[1:45:20] it just now, but you're hearing from it.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; And God, your father, says they need to
[1:45:27] hear a certain thing. So, he sends a
[1:45:29] certain inspiration. He'll have a man
[1:45:32] wrestling it out before God and come
[1:45:35] behind the pullpit and be all nervous
[1:45:37] and brother Brandham just telling his
[1:45:40] life story. That's what I started with.
[1:45:44] And just the thoughts he said he just
[1:45:45] troubled and trembling. He has it has to
[1:45:48] go back over all this tear stained,
[1:45:52] blood stained,
[1:45:54] all of this life that was so filled with
[1:45:58] trouble and agony and sorrow. He has to
[1:46:02] remember it all again
[1:46:04] so that the people can have something to
[1:46:06] hear and be blessed by it. I heard him
[1:46:09] tell it
[1:46:11] and he wept so hard.
[1:46:14] He was actually actually he was at was
[1:46:16] at a breakfast and he was speaking on
[1:46:19] uh the unwanted Christ and how the woman
[1:46:23] saw him. It's not right that he's
[1:46:26] sitting there and his feet are dirty and
[1:46:28] he hasn't been welcomed into this house
[1:46:30] and here he is in this Simon's house and
[1:46:34] she comes and she loses herself and
[1:46:36] forgets everything and comes bursting
[1:46:38] into that feast
[1:46:42] of dignitaries
[1:46:44] and falls down before him begins to weep
[1:46:46] and wash his feet with her tears and
[1:46:49] wipe them with the hairs of her head
[1:46:52] and kiss his feet. And brother
[1:46:53] Brandham's going
[1:46:56] right there and he's weeping so hard.
[1:47:00] And a man who was related to me sitting
[1:47:02] right beside me and his face is just
[1:47:04] bursting red with with weeping and tears
[1:47:08] also. But he didn't see who he was. He
[1:47:11] didn't see who that was. Didn't see who
[1:47:13] the messenger was. And that's just when
[1:47:16] I was coming in. I was thinking, "Oh
[1:47:19] God,
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; what grace is this?
[1:47:23] Hallelujah.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; So someday if you hear someone on the
[1:47:26] other side singing Amazing Grace,
[1:47:28] Brother Brown says it'll be him. I'll be
[1:47:31] singing a duet with him.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:35] Glory to God.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Why don't you stand with me?
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; I'm standing. So we'll all stand.
[1:47:43] I'd like to have the musicians come,
[1:47:45] please.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Dear Lord Jesus,
[1:47:57] how wonderful in the stillness and
[1:47:59] quietness of this moment that each one
[1:48:02] of us can
[1:48:04] experience our hearts filled with a
[1:48:07] thanksgiving.
[1:48:09] One is giving you thanksgiving for
[1:48:12] one thing and someone else for something
[1:48:14] else. But we are the body
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; and we are members in particular.
[1:48:20] And you have said even to the children
[1:48:21] of Israel, you'll be a peculiar people.
[1:48:24] You'll be a holy nation. And oh God, we
[1:48:28] count ourselves by your grace and by
[1:48:31] your promise in that number.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; We are here, Lord. We're not part of the
[1:48:35] nations of the world. Not part of the
[1:48:38] United Nations, but we're part of the
[1:48:40] heavenly kingdom. We are subjects of
[1:48:43] your kingdom. You said we are now
[1:48:46] subjects of your kingdom and we will we
[1:48:48] will take on our immortal mantle after
[1:48:51] this mortal after this little gap has
[1:48:54] been filled in this space of time when
[1:48:57] you will deal with sin. Help us oh God
[1:48:59] to deal with it as you would deal with
[1:49:01] it. Help us to be unbending,
[1:49:04] uncompromising.
[1:49:06] Oh God, let our lives ring with the
[1:49:09] glories of God and THE THANKSGIVING OF
[1:49:12] GOD. We thank you, Father, for having
[1:49:15] taken the book. We thank you for letting
[1:49:17] us know our names were there. Help.
[1:49:20] Thank you for letting us know that you
[1:49:22] were not ashamed of us, but you have
[1:49:24] embraced us in all of our weakness and
[1:49:27] all of our frailties. You have embraced
[1:49:30] us. And I pray, oh God, you'll give us
[1:49:33] hearts filled with thanksgiving. I pray
[1:49:35] in the name of Jesus that the hearts of
[1:49:37] the people, Lord, will be filled to
[1:49:40] bursting, oh God, where they cannot hold
[1:49:42] it. They'll be in their cars. They'll be
[1:49:45] in their rooms. THEY'LL BE ON THEIR
[1:49:47] BEDSIDE or wherever, Lord, and they'll
[1:49:50] have to open their mouth AND SAY, "OH
[1:49:53] GOD, YOU GIVE ME THIS BREATH. You've
[1:49:55] given me this strength. I JUST WANT TO
[1:49:57] SAY GLORY, HALLELUJAH, to your name."
[1:50:01] All hail the name of Jesus. All hail the
[1:50:05] power of God. LET ANGELS PROSTRATE FALL.
[1:50:10] OH, BRING FORTH A ROYAL diadem and crown
[1:50:14] him Lord of all. We thank you, Father.
[1:50:17] Thank you for this Wednesday evening and
[1:50:19] every brother and sister that is here.
[1:50:22] We thank you for the redeemed of the
[1:50:24] Lord that can say so. Oh God, we're
[1:50:28] we're here to give you praise and
[1:50:29] thanksgiving. We've just turned aside
[1:50:32] for a little while this evening on this
[1:50:34] Wednesday evening. We've turned aside
[1:50:36] from all the other activities of life,
[1:50:39] Lord.
[1:50:41] In eternity, we'll be your subjects
[1:50:45] gathered around your throne.
[1:50:48] Oh, glory to God.
[1:50:51] We bless your name. We bless your name.
[1:50:54] In the name of Jesus Christ, I ask your
[1:50:56] blessings upon this people.

[1:59:31] healing. We thank you for all that
