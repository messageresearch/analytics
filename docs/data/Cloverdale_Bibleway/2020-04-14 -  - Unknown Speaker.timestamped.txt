[1:17] I was pastoring been pastoring three and
[1:25] a half years and I was kind of filled
[1:29] with I won't say disillusionment but it
[1:33] was we didn't know you know I had good
[1:37] friends that were Trinitarians and good
[1:39] friends which were Jesus only and we
[1:42] didn't seem to put a lot of importance
[1:44] to it because no one should answer it
[1:46] and then I had heard that you know
[1:50] brother Branham was now speaking some
[1:53] things and I had huge huge questions
[1:56] about it but one day just one day one
[2:03] meeting I happened to have my friend bud
[2:06] Southwick and he always stayed in our
[2:08] house in Dawson Creek and ALW Rasmussen
[2:13] who used to pastor in Edmonton and then
[2:16] he pastored in Tacoma and he was a very
[2:19] very dear friend of brother from Chicago
[2:27] and that whole community was a very
[2:32] closed community and so he said to me he
[2:38] was in my home that one time just once
[2:41] and brother Rasmussen said brother Eddie
[2:44] why don't you write brother Branham and
[2:47] invite him to go on a hunt he said you
[2:51] know perhaps then you could have some
[2:52] meetings as well he said he loves to
[2:55] hunt you know and so that was just
[2:59] enough to nudge me forward and I wrote
[3:02] brother Branham I remember writing a
[3:04] letter and while I wrote the letter my
[3:08] mind was telling me you'll never hear
[3:10] from him he probably gets a hundred
[3:12] thousand letters a month and I thought
[3:15] well this is this just doesn't make
[3:19] sense anyway I wrote and I posted the
[3:23] letter in Dawson Creek and right after
[3:27] that I had resigned the church
[3:30] and came down here to the west coast of
[3:33] British Columbia bought 800 miles south
[3:35] and started to minister to the native
[3:39] Indian people and about three weeks
[3:43] later I got a a phone call a letter from
[3:48] brother Brennan saying that he'd like to
[3:51] go on a hunt and perhaps we can have
[3:54] some meetings in Grand Prairie and
[3:56] Dawson Creek thus that tied those
[3:59] meetings then we arranged those meetings
[4:01] and and I had all these questions about
[4:07] the ministry about the absolute Ezzor is
[4:13] there some definitive absolute on the
[4:17] Godhead and on the baptism and all my
[4:21] how the world opened up then and I so
[4:26] that's why when I was on the platform
[4:29] and I say to you I was there and I found
[4:36] that what he spoke was the truth but yet
[4:40] my heart had some big questions in it
[4:44] but I mean I see the soldier boy it's
[4:48] called elements after clone discs people
[4:52] from my church are called out and he
[4:57] relates exactly things that I know are
[5:01] taking place in their homes and here now
[5:08] I'm with him and driving up the Alaskan
[5:11] Highway to the hunting territory and
[5:15] this is where everything changed because
[5:19] I was one day III actually went on the
[5:24] hunting trip to keep the cost down I was
[5:27] doing the cooking and so one one of the
[5:35] evenings brother branham just said I
[5:38] think I'll just go out and maybe yeah
[5:41] rabid or something for account weight
[5:43] and he said would you like to come
[5:46] brother Eddie I said yes I would like to
[5:48] show and brother Chris Berg who was a
[5:51] dear friend of brother Browns he said
[5:55] yeah maybe I'll come too sure brother
[5:59] Brown said why don't you tell him
[6:00] brother Chris nope he said I'm gonna
[6:03] stay and do the dishes he said you go
[6:05] brother ready we were at camping so we
[6:10] walk along brother branham ride on a
[6:12] path it was a short distance and I could
[6:19] see he was really interested in it was a
[6:22] beautiful evening he was mentioned in
[6:25] hunting I wasn't it at all interested
[6:28] and he walked over in a short distance
[6:32] and just sat on of a log and I sat right
[6:35] beside him and our knees were almost
[6:38] touching and so I wanted to ask a
[6:46] question they have to listen very
[6:48] closely now I was curious why all this
[6:54] manifestation which was so powerful and
[6:57] so real and how the basic element of it
[7:03] could deteriorate and I just I couldn't
[7:07] understand it and that's why it was so
[7:10] disillusioned I thought something's
[7:13] wrong something's wrong
[7:16] so I said to brother Branham I said how
[7:19] is it that people can prophesy they can
[7:25] speak in tongues that can interpret
[7:29] operate the gift of the Spirit can
[7:32] preach and they become so anointed and I
[7:34] said I know what the anointing is and
[7:38] brother Branham said have you heard my
[7:41] service on full anointed ones and I kind
[7:47] of dropped my head because I had not
[7:51] heard a lot of tapes
[7:53] and I said oh no I haven't heard that
[7:56] you know what the strange thing was
[7:58] brother Branham hadn't preached that for
[8:00] five years yet it was five years later
[8:04] that he would preach that service false
[8:07] anointed ones but he said to me he said
[8:12] no the wheat and the tares grow in the
[8:18] same field he said you tell me what the
[8:22] wheat rejoiced in and I'll tell you what
[8:25] the tares rejoiced in and I said yeah I
[8:30] still wasn't getting it he said in the
[8:35] last days Peter said in the last days
[8:37] I'll pour my spirit upon all flesh and
[8:42] he asked me about all and I said all
[8:48] flesh
[8:49] he said ALL but he said not all flesh is
[8:52] saved I said yeah I was beginning to see
[8:58] that there was there was a point here
[9:00] that he was making yeah and then when he
[9:04] got to the wheat and the tares I begin
[9:07] to see and then he said you know like my
[9:10] sheep hear my voice no not all my shape
[9:15] not all or my shape and I begin to see
[9:20] yeah there was something I really he
[9:23] said they're anointed they're they're
[9:27] genuinely anointed but they're wrong
[9:30] seed and I begin to see that that's
[9:34] clearly taught in the scriptures I would
[9:38] like to say to the people who hear this
[9:42] I met the master I didn't meet just
[9:47] William random him I knew but I met the
[9:51] master their God that he served and he
[9:54] said I was riding on my horse this
[9:59] afternoon behind brother bud and the son
[10:03] was war
[10:04] and I believe he said that you have
[10:06] three questions you want to ask me was
[10:09] exactly the truth my heart was just
[10:12] completely exposed he said the first one
[10:16] is on the baptism and he took him in the
[10:19] order they were in my heart and the
[10:22] Serpent's seed I didn't even want to
[10:23] discuss but he said the first one is the
[10:26] baptism the second one is the Godhead
[10:30] and the third one is the Serpent's seed
[10:32] and I knew that if he avoided the
[10:39] scripture you know just avoided that
[10:44] Scripture I knew the Word of God was the
[10:47] absolute but I didn't understand it and
[10:50] when he said the serpent seed I said but
[10:52] brother Branham I was so wound up I
[10:56] rearranged my finger Mountain is his
[10:59] respect I just raised my finger I said
[11:01] but the scripture says and Adam knew his
[11:05] wife and she conceived call his name
[11:10] came privacy demand from the Lord he
[11:13] said of course is from the Lord all life
[11:17] comes from God doesn't matter whether
[11:20] it's a right relationship or wrong
[11:22] relationship all life comes from God and
[11:26] I said yeah he said but you need to read
[11:29] the next verse I didn't know what the
[11:32] next verse was and she again bare his
[11:35] brother Abel said they were twins that's
[11:40] when I knew I'd missed something there
[11:43] were twins he said they've always been
[11:44] twins Cain and Abel Isaac and Ishmael
[11:50] Jacob and Esau he said at Calvary there
[11:56] wasn't three that died it was four well
[11:59] that was know and he had his hand up
[12:02] like that he said Jesus and Judas Jesus
[12:08] and one thief
[12:09] and Judas and the other thief and he
[12:12] went like that and he said he took one
[12:16] his way Jesus took one thief to heaven
[12:20] and Judas the son of perdition took one
[12:22] his way and then I realized it said then
[12:28] there were Antichrist in Christ Christ
[12:32] and Antichrist every every revival Bears
[12:36] twins
[12:37] and I could understand what was
[12:40] happening and what I was disillusioned
[12:43] about I knew one thing that my heart had
[12:46] been exposed and I was like naked before
[12:51] God and there was nothing hidden with
[12:55] God and that's the way it was with the
[12:58] people on the platform that's why he
[13:00] asked not hundreds thousands and
[13:03] thousands is that true is that true it
[13:06] was always true not one time in all of
[13:10] the lives in all of the years of
[13:12] ministry not one time did anyone say no
[13:16] that's not true it was always true and
[13:20] that's why it was the Spirit of Truth
[13:22] and that was the Spirit of Truth coming
[13:24] to me and I can say that all my
[13:29] questions were answered and have been
[13:33] answered by the word ever since
[13:36] and that is the truth and one thing I
[13:41] can say I met one along
[13:44] I met the god that the woman at the well
[13:48] man saying Lord Jesus
[13:53] [Music]
[14:00] now I feel
[14:04] [Music]
[14:05] yeah
