TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] of God. We uh trust that everyone appreciates this morning. We're in a little bit different setup and uh so the sound will sound a little different now that we've got the uh windows out of the back and we're trying to uh do some experimenting prior to the services that we have coming up for the convention. How many are praying Lord will have his way in the convention? Amen. Uh but we would also like you to appreciate that the lobby now is part of the sanctuary and so this uh will have a number of effects. Number one uh we want everyone to respect and govern your movement accordingly. Uh we don't want to have any visiting. What was the foyer? It's now part of the sanctuary. Parents, you need to keep your children under control. And I know sometimes we have children who are sitting away from their parents. But parents, you need to be aware of your children even if they're not with you. And if they move out, uh need to go to the washroom, uh you need to just tell, well, why don't you come back and sit with us if you can't govern yourself accordingly. And um so we would really appreciate that. And parents too with children. If you've got children that are, you know, making noise, you're going to have to take them out and, you know, you may have to stay out. I know sometimes there's children who, you know, they're not crying and they're just having a good time, but it's very distracting to the person who's next to you. And uh so uh just respect that and appreciate that while you may be trying to get something out of the service, so the so is the person next to you. And uh kids can be very distracting. Um, let's turn on the screen to number 618. My wonderful Lord. My wonderful Lord. [Music] Let's stand together as we worship God. I have found a deep peace that I had known and a joy this world could not afford. Since I yielded control of my body and soul to my wonderful, wonderful.

You're welcome, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm going to ask our brother Tom to come and pray this morning. We've got a prayer cloth here. There's a request for Sharon Hunter or Shannon Hunter with Hodkdins lymphoma. Also, Michael BS who has a tumor in his salivary gland. If you're here this morning, you need a touch from God, you just lift your hand before the Lord as we come before him. If you're listening in on the internet, on the phone, hook up. Amen. Lord's with you this morning as well. Will you just reach out and touch him as we go before him this morning. Amen. Brother Tom, if you'd come. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, as the song writer has panned, I was born to be a dwelling place, a home for the presence of the Lord. Father, we've gathered this resurrection morning in this building called Cloverdale Bible Way. But Lord, without the people of God, without the children of God standing here and being the true church of the living God, let your presence so envelop each and every life. Lord, as brother Rod has mentioned, these requests, there's many needs here this morning. Hands are raised and hearts are lifted up. We say, "Oh God, meet these needs. You're still Jehovah Gyra. You're still our provider. Lord, you've provided bloody skins for Adam. You've given us a bleeding, bloody word in this hour. We want to wrap ourselves within it. We say, God, wash us clean. Heal your people, Lord. And as the word of God shall come forth, Lord, as our pastor will come, let the word of God come with uncction. May it come with healing. May it come with deliverance. May it come, Lord God. Lifting your people up into heavenly places, Lord. That's what we've for is to dwell in your presence and to lift up that holy name. So Lord, every soul that is gathered, Lord, even on the internet, we pray that you'll minister to each and every one of us. And may you be glorified at the end of the day. May our hearts burn within us as this resurrected king will walk with us down this journey this morning. Speak to us Lord. Anoint both speaker and hearer. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. You can have your seats. [Music] Brother Jonathan Walner is going to come bless us with a song. Brother Jonathan, if you'd come, get ready. Uh, appreciate that. Uh, uh, deacons have given me the number of a, uh, Washington car. It's a Washington plates a Honda number is 838VSK. Um I think the lights are on. Also it's parked on the neighbor's lawn. We need to respect the neighbors in the area and appreciate that uh uh this your car that you'd move it and uh make sure you're turn your lights off too. Um as well uh we want to welcome all those who are visiting with us. Really happy to have each and every one of you. If you're here as a as a visitor, we just are really uh thankful to have you here and trust you enjoy yourself this morning. Um we want to welcome brother Leon uh Carolyn.

Also, one last announcement. Uh there is um they want all of the Sunday school children here next Sunday at 9:45 a.m. because uh they're singing and they need everyone here on time. [Music] [Music] They fought throughout the ages. es to keep this word alive. Standing for the truth with their children by their side. [Music] All because the gospel was burning in their heart. So now with them I'll take my stand. I will do my part. I am a witness of the Lord Jesus Christ. [Music] Reaching out to lost and weery wounded lives. Sharing gospel truth that gives them brand new sight. I am a witness of the Lord Jesus Christ. [Music] I'm so thankful that a witness came across my path when I was living my life in sin. so deserving of God's wrath. And now this preious gospel is burning in my heart. I live my life to testify of my brand new start. I am a witness of the Lord Jesus Christ. Reaching out to lost and weery wounded lives, sharing gospel truth that gives them brand new sight. I am a witness of the Lord Jesus Christ. I am a witness of the Lord Jesus Christ. Reaching out to lost and weery wounded lives. Sharing goel truth that gives them brand new sight. I am a witness of the Lord Jesus Christ. [Music] I am a witness of the Lord Jesus Christ. [Music] I understand brother Jonathan wrote that song and it's real a blessing. Thanks brother Jonathan. Um, we have a baby dedication and as brother Tom comes, let's sing uh number 753. I am so glad that our father in heaven. I am so glad that our father in heaven tells us his love in the book. Wonderful things in the Bible. I see this is the dearest that Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves even me. I am so glad that Jesus loves meus. I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can say that this morning with a great assurance that Jesus loves even me. I'm feel privileged and honored to be able to take this baby dedication this morning. It's my little granddaughter, Kayla Ariel Ray. Now, this is um I didn't have the ability to have girls. I just had boys. But my sons have been faithful to their calling and are bringing forth girls. And this is very special. Amen. Michaela who was like unto God feminine part of Michael and Ariel lion of God and if you want to look in uh in in Israel today Ariel Chiron and he had there was a book written of Ariel Chiron he's called the warrior well we have a little girl here this morning a little baby little bundle of joy middle name is Ariel lion of God may God give the boldness of a lion if God should tar and I just trust that God will just put his hand of approval on this little jewel. She has quite a heritage. She has a daddy here that loves the Lord. She has a mommy that's dedicated to Christ. A daddy that knows the Lord. And Brother Bram said, you know, that perfect little family and oneness of God, he said, standing in his presence where the daddy is in his place, the mother's in her place, and the children standing there. Oh, he said, isn't that a blessed sight? standing in harmony in his presence. And as I was thinking of Michael and Abigail, I was thinking of that little family coming in the Garden of Eden once again. And may father come down and grant to them their need. But in thinking of this baby dedication, I was moved to look to a scripture in Exodus 12 where Moses was to speak unto the congregation of Israel, saying, "In the 10th day of the month, they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house." And that's a responsibility, Michael, that you're to carry. God has blessed your home with two children, a a wonderful wife that we could also take the lamb, not something of 4,000 some years ago, but a a lamb of God this hour, a lamb for a house. And that blood shall be unto you a token where you are. And when I see the blood, I'll pass over you. and the plague shall not be unto you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt." And we believe the judgment angel has come down and is going throughout the land. But because of a a daddy that has known God has applied the lamb for his house, the death angel will pass and this little child will be cradled in in the arms of a mommy and daddy that love the Lord. He said in the token message, "Flee for safety. Apply it and believe. Here's what you want to do. Believe for your safety. Then apply the token for your whole family. See, claim it. It worked on you. Then you and the word becomes one and it's going to work for your family. &gt;&gt; Amen. May the presence of God so overshadow this little jewel, Michaela Ariel Ray. and may his presence ever guide her down life's road. Many people dedicate or would I would say offer their children to the gods of pleasure, the gods of sports, gods of music, gods of leadya. But a little family has come this morning to dedicate their little girl to the presence of God and to give him the glory in this life. All right, let's pray. Lord, with great joy I cradle within my arms the gift of God you've blessed his home with. Lord, as Michael has applied the token in his life, Abigail within her life, you've blessed their home. Lord, with children and now this morning, I'm cradling in my arms Michaela Ariel. I pray, Lord, that your blessing will ever rest upon this child. That Father, one that could be like unto God. Lord, that's our cry to be like Jesus, to be like you, author and finish of our faith. Keep your hand on this child, Lord. And if time should Terry give her the boldness of a lion to stand for this one that we love and adore, you've blessed the home. bless this child and we dedicate her back to you this morning in this little dedication service. May you bless her, keep her and Lord, may you ever put a hedge around her. We give her back to you this morning in the name of Jesus Christ for your glory. Amen. Amen, sweetheart. It's good to have our brother Wes Ardel here with us this morning. And brother Wes is going to come and bless us with a song along with a choir. And as they're coming, let's sing together. So I'm casting all my cares on you. Lord, I know you love me. Isn't that wonderful to know that he loves you? So I'm casting all my cares on you. &gt;&gt; I'm glory [Music] by love. That's a Christmas story. Oh for restoration, for redemption. That's what seven angels cloud testify. My redeemer [Music] coming back for you. &gt;&gt; Oh, so I'm casting all my car on you. Oh Lord, I know you love me. [Music] my Oh, that's the greatest love story for restoration for redemption. That's what seven angels found. my redeemer. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's certainly good to see everybody here this morning. And I just wanted to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and bring greetings from our little church in Georgia, the Revealed Word Tabernacle. And uh greet you uh also bring greetings from my pastor, Brother Dutch Scott. And uh it's just so wonderful to be back here with family again. Amen. It's all you are is family. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So I hope this song is a blessing to you this morning. Amen. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I've seen a vision harsh and sweet of one who gave all he had for me. I felt the passion of his death and the forgiveness of his final breath. Now I can never be the same. My heart has been forever changed. I want to live and love and give the way he gave. Now I'm giving my life away. laying it down on the altar. Now I'm giving my life away. &gt;&gt; The very least I can offer is my own. [Music] So here I stand today, giving my life away. [Music] No earthly price could be too great. No sacrifice too much to make. No way of measuring the cost next to the blood of Calary's cross. Oh, so if I live, I live for him. Or if I die, I can. [Applause] My life is not my own. But he from this day on. This day on now. &gt;&gt; Giving my life away. &gt;&gt; Laying it down on the &gt;&gt; on the altar. Now I'm giving my life. Oh, is that your desire this morning? Oh, the very least I can offer is my own. So here I stand today, giving my life away. Now I'm giving my life away. Oh, laying it down on the altar. Now I'm giving my life away. Oh, the very least I can offer is my own. [Music] So here I stand today, giving my life away. Oh, now I'm giving my life away. Oh, holding it down on the altar. Now I'm giving my life home away. The very least I can offer is my own. [Music] So here I stand today giving my life away. &gt;&gt; So here I stand today giving my life away. [Music] Thanks, brother West. Choir, man. We don't want to hold anything back this morning. Give everything we have to him. Let's uh Brother Biscll now comes bring the word. Remember me, Almighty One. Remember me. Remember me [Music] all night. [Music] All mighty, [Music] speak now to me. Speak now to [Music] All mighty, speak out to me, all mighty. &gt;&gt; Sing it again. Remember me. [Music] All the one almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful day in his presence as I listened to uh Wes and the young people sing. I couldn't help but have uh just a I I I had a if I had a wish that could come true instantly. I would like to have been the ages the age of one of them. I'd like to be about 18, 19, 20 and be able to start all over again. just want to have another life. &gt;&gt; Burn it up for God. And I pray that each one of those young people that were singing that it will have a new reality to them. I'm laying my life down. I'm giving it all up. Amen. Isn't that the desire of everyone? I just love to see uh don't only love to hear it, but I love to see it. Love to see it in action. Just laying it down. We'll be having a good opportunity of of giving giving out of our uh especially of our time and our energy and the convention that's upcoming because uh I I would like to ask as I have already on the last Sunday I believe I would like the congregation to take it very seriously that we want to be uh a people given to hospitality. Uh we have not had a convention like this for about 10 years. We don't know when the next one if ever because we're counting on a homegoing. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's one of the reasons of even having a gathering like this because we intend to have a homegoing. We want this to be something that moves the body of Christ, the bride of Christ in that direction. And so we think of those which the scripture has said and lays a good deal of responsibility on the leaders uh bishop uh must be given to hospitality. But I think also of the house of Stefanis or Stephanas, however they pronounce it, but the Bible says they had addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints. And so anyone can addict themselves to the ministry of the saints. So we want to encourage you to be uh to take that uh to take that to heart as well. And then I would like to say also because there's going to be a lot of ministers wives that are here and some of you sisters will be mingling with them and some will have more contact than others. Uh but I find that if you are going to have friends, you also must show yourself friendly and uh make yourself available. Uh I want to encourage the uh the congregation and to the sisters when you have a gathering there sometime you may feel a wee bit at loose ends when there's perhaps not a man there or your husband there because he may be engaged with other things. But you can keep the conversation spiritual. And by that I don't mean, you know, attempting to be super spiritual, but you can keep this conversation uh spiritual. You can keep it up from just the natural chatter of all kinds of natural things. And I find one of the best ways, I'm just going to give you just a wee bit of help here. One of the best ways to keep a conversation spiritual, whether it's a ga a gathering around men, a gathering around the ministers, or gathering of the sisters just together in in fellowship or around a table. And that is to ask one of the visiting sisters or brothers, ask, "How did you come to the knowledge of the message? How did your candle get lit?" And I never fail to be so blessed when I hear that. And the accounts, the stories, the the witness, the testimonies are absolutely incredible. And it's one of the best ways to find out how God dealt. I mean, when you hear a testimony, you're actually hearing how God Almighty reached into some foreign land or some place that's foreign to you, not foreign to them. That's their home. and find out how God dealt with them, how God brought came across their pathway and you'll find right away the presence of the Lord will be there and it's just a special time. Amen. And in saying that, I'll give you a second piece of advice. Be a good listener. &gt;&gt; Be a good listener. Sometimes we feel, well, we've got so much to say, but oh, I think our lives are enriched when we are a good listener and we hear how God dealt with someone else. And then lastly, seek to be a blessing and seek to receive a blessing. And if we just keep these simple things in place, uh I believe it will be a a great time. Um there are many that are working hard and we we can't even begin to name them. Just all kinds of people are working hard to uh to do what they can do and uh many of you will be called on to to help to participate in some way. You might feel it's very small and insignificant but it's not. It takes it all and it takes all of us to uh do to make it what I believe God wants it to be. And uh uh some of the those I know that uh brother Tony and brother Derek and brother Ernie, they're working very hard because we are able to uh make a real statement as far as what has been happening in Bible believers and the missions. There's so much that happens on a daily basis that you're just not able to have enough time to tell you what is taking place and the testimonies. But we want you to rejoice in that as well. And we want to be able to let others from other congregations know. Uh I had two phone calls just I had a email and a phone call uh yesterday and the phone call was from brother Dan Daisley. I want the church to uh remember to pray for brother Dan. He had heart surgery just a short time ago. I believe he said it was five weeks. Doesn't seem that long, but he's had a very slow recovery. He doesn't have much use of his arms at this time. He said, and and when he told me that he wouldn't be able to come to the meetings, he actually broke down and and cried. He just was so sad that he wouldn't be able to be here to the meetings. And then they have special meetings uh coming up in in August. And uh it may be that brother Tony will be there with some of the brothers that are coming here. We're just not too sure how that is all going to work out yet. But uh I asked him how he was going to be handling his meeting and and they are still going ahead with it. And brother Harold Hillbrand is going to be their speaker this year. So we are uh we want to be remembering brother Dan. I mean I just uh my heart was touched very very deep when he just wanted to be here so bad. Brother William Ryerson in Norway had planned right up to just a few days ago to come. He's not strong enough. He also had surgery, open heart surgery and not able to come. He's ministering in his own church in Norway, but he won't be able to be here. So, they both wanted to be remembered to you. And then last but not least, I would like to ask you please and this this goes for everyone because everyone can pray. I'd like you to bathe literally bathe and cradle these meetings in prayer. for the song leaders, for the musicians, for the people that are sound and the video people, the streaming, the deacons, the trustees, especially the ministers, the ministry, and if you'll pray for myself, we I really solicit an earnest interest in your prayers. and just get under the burden of prayer if you would please because we need such divine guidance from moment to moment and we appreciate you. I appreciate you. Appreciate that you're here today. You see also we've taken the windows out of the uh of the sanctuary part. So we have literally extended the sanctuary. The sanctuary is out in the foyer now. So we don't want you to treat the foyer as a foyer. There's to be no visiting there. and and those with children and so on, if you need to take them out, you'll take them out to the children's room or into the fellowship room. And uh we just want to keep the whole area sacred. I believe that'll be pleasing to God, wouldn't you? Amen. So, having said that, I'll have you stand and we'll sing. We are standing on holy ground and we'll be turning to the word. Um turning to the book of uh Jeremiah the 29th chapter. We are standing [Music] on holy ground [Music] through me and I know that there are angels all around. Let us pray. Jesus [Music] we are standing in his presence. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's have our sisters sing it please. We are standing. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, you are. And I know that there are angels all around. Let us pray. Jesus. &gt;&gt; We worship our presence. &gt;&gt; All of the brothers thou please. &gt;&gt; We are standing on holy ground. And I know that there are angels all around. &gt;&gt; We thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Let us praise our Jesus. We are standing in his presence on holy ground. this once for everyone. Now we are [Music] on ground [Music] all around. Let us pray. Jesus. [Music] We are standing in his presence on holy ground. Our Lord Jesus, we're here to worship you. We're here to praise and to give you glory. We magnify your name. We are here to glorify that name. And I pray that all that is said and done, Lord, will be to the glory of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Almighty God, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, I pray that you'll manifest yourself, make yourself known, and I pray that you will be the one that will do the supernatural. For man, we do not rest upon the arms of the arms of flesh. Man's strength fails. Man's wisdom departs. But Lord, the word of God shall last forever. And we pray today you'll make your word known. Pray that you'll anoint both hearers and the speaker. And we hide ourselves, oh God, in the shadow of the cross and behind that great sacrifice without which we are nothing. And so we pray, Lord, you will take this audience of people and those that are streaming at this moment and part of the service. Bless them, I pray, permeate the atmosphere in the name of Jesus Christ and penetrate every heart and mind. I pray, oh God, you will bind the enemy and hinder him from having any effect upon the service. And may your will, perfect will be done in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Thank you. We'll turn to the Bible now and read from Jeremiah the 29th chapter, starting at verse 8. down to verse 14. For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, let not your prophets and your divers that be in your midst be in the midst of you deceive you, neither hearken to your to your dreams which ye have cause which you cause to be dreamed. For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name, I have not sent them, sayeth the Lord. For thus sayeth the Lord, that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then shall ye call upon me, and you shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you, and you shall seek me, and find me, when you shall search for me with all your heart, and I will be found of you, sayeth the Lord. and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether I have driven you, said the Lord, and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive. Amen. You may be seated. I'd appreciate and we'll need your undivided attention if you stay just as focused as you can mentally on what is being said. Sometimes when you lose just a sentence, you don't pick it up. You don't get the thought for some time. So, we just want to really give ourselves now to the word. I'd like to give just a wee bit of background. uh on Wednesday I spoke on applying the token and that uh applying the token is the is the application of a lived out life and as brother Tom used a quote that I used Wednesday night for your own safety first and then you apply it to others which especially related to the family in the scripture but you are applying it to others for an eternal benefit and that the applying of the token is actually an action word. It is an activity. It's something that we are uh we are responsible to do. And I believe especially as fathers, mothers, parents, uh we are responsible to do that. and then also for one another as far as uh brothers and sisters in Christ. I believe that we are responsible to have a positive effect upon each other's life. Now the background to this scripture that we are reading today, it has to do if we were to go back and we won't have the time to do so, but if I was reading and in my studies, we go back and review the earlier chapters in uh Jeremiah. And this scripture which we read just now is the text that brother Brandham spoke in the message desperation which was the next service after the token. So about half of this service of uh half of the service of the of desperation that he spoke was actually carried over right from the token because he is he's saying and if you were to read the token which also is the scripture brother Tom used in the dedication of his grandchildren the the token was taken and the uh the blood was applied in a desperate power. &gt;&gt; There was great desperation that night. And so, it's not something they were just doing casually. It wasn't a tradition because they had never done it before. This was the first time. And this was to escape the judgment of God that was going to fall upon an entire nation, which incidentally was a superpower at that time. So we can just relate to it if it were America the superpower or some other superpowers which are not the superpower but it Egypt was the superpower at that time and judgment was falling upon them and God uh God was giving the token that they might escape it. Now so that was the text for the desperation which was spoken the very next day. So I will be uh tying together some things which will relate back to Wednesday's service a wee bit but the background here were and that's why the scripture uh God is speaking in the scripture that the the people are not to hear these prophets which were false prophets there were false prophets and divers and so on. So that that that was part of the background. If you were to read chapters 27 28 uh then you would find out that there was a false prophet. I'm going to refer to it just now that prophesied but they prophesied very good things. So the people were given over to hear those prophets because the prophecy sounded so good. And uh God had spoke through Jeremiah that Israel would be taken captive and would be captive in Babylon for 70 years. Now not all of the people were taken into Babylon. But uh they were nevertheless they were controlled and taken under captivity by Nebuchadnezzar which was king of Babylon. And then there was this prophet called Haniah. And Haniah is referred to brother Brandon refers to him many times. And he prophesied and his prophecy was this. Haniah the son of Azor the prophet which was of Guehon spake uh unto me in the house of the Lord. So now here's Haniah speaking to Jeremiah in the house of the Lord in the presence of the priests and all of the people. And this is what he said. Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. And within two full years will I bring again into this place all of the vessels of the Lord because the vessels had been taken out of the house of God and carried into Babylon. And of course, a great desecration was taking place. And so Haniah was prophesying, here's one prophet saying that you're going to go into captivity. you're going to be in Babylon 70 years. Here's another one. rises up and says, "Thus sayaeth the Lord, in the presence of all the priests and the presence of all the people that in within two full years I'm going to bring everyone back and I'm going to restore all the vessels of the Lord and I'll bring them back into this house and Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon that that the king had taken out of this place into Babylon and I will bring again to this place Econiah the son of Jim, king of Judah, and all the captives of Judah. that went into Babylon, sayith the Lord, for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. Even the prophet Jeremiah said, "Amen." Said, "That sounds good." Jeremiah said, "Amen." Amen. And uh that's what the scripture says. And Jeremiah said, "Amen. The Lord do so. The Lord performed thy words which thou hast prophesied to bring again the vessels of the Lord's house and all that is carried away captive from Babylon into this place in the message influence. Brother Brandham said and Jeremiah had a yoke around his neck which he did. He had a yoke upon his neck. And God had told him no matter what prophet prophesies, what dreamer dreams or anything else contrary to what he said that contrary to what God had said, it was wrong. And there stood up Haniah just as sincere as any man could be and prophesied with a message, thus saith the Lord. Well, he said, 'Well, of course, the people could clap their hands and they rejoice and they probably would today. They get excited over this one and clap their hands. He says, "And Haniah saying they'll be back in two years in the sight of two full years and he walked up to the vindicated prophet, which he did. He walked up to Jeremiah, took the yolk off his neck, and he broke it." said, "Thus sayaith the Lord, going to break the yoke uh that that uh Nebuchadnezzar has upon Israel. We're going to break it." And remember what Jeremiah said to Haniah said, "Haniah, amen. So be it. The Lord performed your words. But let us remember, there has been prophets before us. There have been prophets before you and me. &gt;&gt; And they prophesied against great kingdoms, against war, and so forth. But a prophet is only known when his prophecy comes to pass. &gt;&gt; We've had all kinds of preaching and all kinds of prophecies and all kinds of negative things or positive things. Regardless of what it is, either way, it's irrelevant unless it comes to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why I have confidence in this message even this morning which I won't say anything about but we were speaking in the study and how things that this prophet spoke which when he said it seemed impossible it would the human mind would say I'll never see that I'll never witness that and here it is happening in the last few days right amongst us in our own city I can tell you my brothers and sisters not that you don't know it, but that you will just be reconfirmed that when a prophet is only known when his prophecy comes to pass, when he speaks and it's then, thus sayeth the Lord, not because I say so, not because you say so, because God does it. &gt;&gt; God does it. This is not a battle of the words. This is not a struggle of words, friends. God's word comes to pass. God's word materializes. &gt;&gt; It literally materializes. It's a word, but it becomes material. It becomes substance, &gt;&gt; whether it be a healing or a deliverance or whatever more. And then Jeremiah, he spoke again and he said, then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Haniah the prophet, "Hear now, Haniah, the Lord hath not sent thee." He just said amen to his prophecy. But he says, "The truth is God hasn't sent you, but thou makest this people to trust in a lie." &gt;&gt; That's what's really sad. It is sad that someone prophesies a falsehood. But it is it's very much compounded when people believe it and trust in it and go headlong into it and find themselves into bondage. How many people have trusted the denominational system and look where it has taken them? &gt;&gt; He said, "Therefore, thus said the Lord, behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth. This year, thou shalt die because thou hast taught rebellion against the Lord." And even though God allowed Nebuchadnezzar to take the people captive, even though all of that had happened, it seemed like a very negative thing, but because they had they had gone into idolatry and God allowed that. And I'll tell you, my friends this morning that it's important that we keep our focus and that God is our God. Materialism isn't our God. A good life isn't our God. &gt;&gt; None of those things are our God. But we can make anything a god. But we're not making anything by God's grace. We don't want to make our job, our family, our work or material things or anything else or pleasure. We have one God and that is the true and living God. We must serve him with everything that is within us. Now although Nebuchadnezzar had taken Israel captive and had carried all the holy vessels out of Babylon and they became desecrated in that country. Yet God did not intend that the people would lose their inheritance. He wanted them to maintain their inheritance. in the Smyrnian church age says when Israel entered into unlawful alliances with the world and formed fellowships by marriage, the day finally came when the world took over and Babylon carried them away, carried the people away into captivity. Now, here's I want I have this highlighted for you. Now when they went into captivity, they went they went in having a priesthood, a temple, and the word. &gt;&gt; But when they came back, they had rabbis, a theological order of Pharisees, a synagogue, and the Talmud. &gt;&gt; So they went in with a priesthood, came up with rabbis. They went in having had a temple. Now they come back with uh synagogues which they needed. And when Jesus came they were so corrupt that he called them of their father the devil. And this in spite of the fact that they were Abrahams according to the flesh. In this age we see the same thing happening. However, as all Israel is not Israel, but a little group where the true spiritual Israelites, so there would always be a little group of true Christians, the bride of Christ until he come for his own. &gt;&gt; There will be a little group, &gt;&gt; true believers. So Jeremiah said this which we read and I now need to read it because now I want to start breaking into the subject. Thus sayith the Lord after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon. This is how you went in. This is what's happened. You've gone into captivity. False prophets has rise. Dreamers have dreamed all kinds of things. The people got a whole myriad of voices and all kinds of opinions. But now God's voice, God's voice and mouthpiece speaks again through his prophet. I will after 70 years are established, I will visit you. And I'm going to just give you some phrases that I want you to remember. If you're want to jot them down will be fine. Also, I will visit you and will perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place. Especially now verse 11, for I, God's speaking, I know the thoughts. No one else knows them, but I know the thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth the Lord. thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you. This is the purpose of God's thoughts that he was thinking towards the people to give you an expected end. I'm going to dissect that down in a few moments. And it is marvelous. Absolutely marvelous. And then now here's God speaking. You will be 70 years, &gt;&gt; but I will visit you &gt;&gt; because I know the thoughts that I have &gt;&gt; towards you &gt;&gt; and their thoughts of peace are not of evil to bring you to an expected end. And then the scripture says then you know when I preach, when I read, when I study, I often I I will make a great emphasis for myself and that's why I make emphasis to you. When you find the word then you need to really find out what was said prior to that. Now God is rehearsing what I said about 70 years of captivity that is still in place. I'm not changing my mind about that. That's the conditions that we're in. We have certain conditions in this age. I I wish that I I'm glad we're living in this age because God has ordained us for this age. But this age is a corrupt age. This age is a dishonest age. This age is a whirly. It's a infested with uncleanness. It's a vile and vulgar age. &gt;&gt; I'm ashamed of my own community when I pick up a little local rag newspaper and find that high school girls are dragging uh teenage boys. Oh, you might smile and say, "Well, you know, they they've done that or they did that in my high school." I think it's a disgrace going and dragging young fellows and dragging them through the school and being just absolutely uh uh full of rebellion. And the teachers teachers that should be respected. Tell them we don't want this to happen. And they curse them out with the vilest of language. Vulgar, vulgar language. Teenagers, they ought to be taken by their parents and spanked. You say, "Well, that's against the law." It's not against this law. &gt;&gt; They ought to learn some respect &gt;&gt; using a vulgar language. This has happened in the last few days. And I I'm I'm I feel a sense of disgrace within myself that I have to be associated with this kind of a thing in my community, in schools that are being supported by your taxes and my taxes. and then this kind of thing is allowed and they not able to control it and taking young fellas and and dragging their clothes off of them. It's a disgrace. &gt;&gt; Absolute disgrace. That's the age that we're in. And we can't just, you know, kind of uh ease it off and say, "Well, you know, nothing we can do about it." Well, at least we have a testimony that's in opposition to that kind of a thing. And we don't only live it, but we speak it. We declare it. And we we we're thankful for the message that we have. I'm thankful for the young men and young women that we have. I'm thankful for the children that we have. We need to give them all the support that we can and say, "God bless you, young men. God bless you, young ladies. God bless the teachers. God bless &gt;&gt; those that would live godly." &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, this is the age. It's a dark age. The light goes out. &gt;&gt; Leodysia. &gt;&gt; Wait. And but but God nevertheless and Leoa sent a prophet, sent a message and the message couldn't change. He had to go back to this. It was exactly like when John the Baptist came and and introducing Jesus Christ, they couldn't even recognize the word. &gt;&gt; They had drifted so far from it. The Jewish people had drifted so far. And in 2,000 years of the greatest some of the greatest ministries and the media and the printed page and all these things printed page for over 500 years and radios and telephones and a printed page and magazines and and tape recorders and all of these things and still it goes downhill, &gt;&gt; straight downhill. Even in the last hundred years when you see the kind of movement and spiritual movement that has been and that's a paradox with all of this uh tools at our disposal. Why is it going downhill? Because the scripture says it would. &gt;&gt; Any other reason you'd think it would increase and and things would improve and spiritually improve, but it seems like all the anchors have been let go. And I can assure you because it's already been spoken, there's all kinds of Hananas that are saying it's better. Things are better. I can tell you that's not what the word of God says. The word of God says through the lips of Jesus, when when the son of man returns, shall he find faith on the earth. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says, "Not just faith as we know faith, but the faith the faith of God in the word of God &gt;&gt; shall he find faith on the earth. Not great multitudes of revival. That's not what he said is going to happen. &gt;&gt; Saying you got some great sweep of hundreds of thousands of people being swept into the kingdom of God. That's not what the scripture says. Says few there be that enter in. Strive to enter in. I tried to come to Wednesday. Strive. That's a that's an act of desperation. &gt;&gt; That's not just sitting back, ho ho, it'll happen if it's supposed to happen or it won't if it's not. That's not the scripture. You can't find it in the scripture. When it came to the Passover, it was a moment of urgency. It was a moment of desperation. They were doing something for the first time they hadn't done before, but they had to do it. And they had to do it with a staff in the hand and shoes on their feet and ready to move on out. And that's the way we need to be as believers. I'm doing everything I can. This is the gospel of the hour that God has given us. A vindicated voice. And I'm I'm going to have my shoes on my feet, my staff in my hand. I'm going to influence everybody I can around me. I'm going to clean up house. &gt;&gt; I'm going to clean up my life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to move the things out that must not be here. Why? Because it's an hour of desperation. He says, "And I'm going to visit you." I have a little clip. I wasn't going to play it. It's going to take a few minutes. I just felt that maybe some needed to hear this. This is actually brother Brandham's voice in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And before you hear it, he's got people. He has just preached to the people. And the message he has preached is, "Is there anything too hard for the Lord?" And he was he he he was talking about the visitation. And I'm at that point just now with a message that has God visited us? Has God visited this generation? Because God said to Jeremiah, "Now after this bondage, I will visit you." &gt;&gt; God didn't just We say, "Oh, God's here all the time." But there are times that he has chosen throughout the history of man where he visited in a very special way. He says to Abraham concerning Sarah, "I will visit her." And when he visited her, she she she had life. She conceived conceived life. That was an individual and one child come forth. Then he said to Moses. Now he had a whole nation. &gt;&gt; But he said to Moses, "I will visit you. I will visit them." And because of his visitation, a whole nation came out of a nation. &gt;&gt; And he prophesied he would visit us. He visited us in a special way through Jesus Christ in his first coming to purchase a people at Calvary. And then he prophesied in the end time before judgment comes. I'll visit that generation again. I will reestablish that it's God that I am God of this word. I am God of Israel and I have redeemed a people out of the Gentiles and I'm going to come and take them &gt;&gt; in a rapture. I'm going to catch them away. &gt;&gt; I'm going to defeat death. &gt;&gt; I bought it at Calvary. I'm going to take a people. They're going to be changed in their bodies while I stand on the earth. I'm going to take them out of this dark evil age. And the token evidence of that was healing. So he sends a messenger in the end time with that gift of healing. Not just a gift of healing. Calls people out. They're sitting in the audience in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And now you'll just hear it. Please uh brother Michael if we can just have that &gt;&gt; you pray in your heart and believe God say God I'm a child of Abraham and I believe with all my heart and let the Holy Spirit come and perform here tonight as he did down there. Will all of you believe on him with all your heart? Let's just on the piano ever who is the pianist there if you will sing the great it just play slowly the great position now is near if you will while we just pray now this is spiritual [Music] &gt;&gt; I remember some time ago that was playing Fort Wayne Indiana something happened. A dunkered girl who didn't have the Holy Ghost. She got filled with the spirit and jumped up from the piano and run away. About 5,000 people sitting there seeing that piano continually playing. The great physician now is near. People just raising up everywhere being healed. As much a bunch of Amish and dunkers, Fort Wayne, the sympathizing Jesus. I'm going to look at my brethren back here. You pray. Brethren, we're all going to meet someday in the land beyond. [Music] We'll have to give an account for our ministries, what we do with Jesus all time. We teach our people that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; You believe that, don't you, brother? &gt;&gt; Now, [Music] now just a moment. There's someone to my extreme right praying. It's a man, and he's praying because he's in a serious condition. He's suffering from a like a bladder trouble. He's got tumor. He's had an operation. And if he's up for another operation, that's a man sitting right there with his hand up. &gt;&gt; That's true. If that's true, stand on your feet. If we're strangers one another, wave your hand. &gt;&gt; Do you believe the same angel of God is in the building? &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. Except what did you touch, sir? You were praying, wasn't you, for your healing? Well, then if me standing here, my back turned to you, that same angel that declared this that Sodom that Jesus said would be here in the last days just before he's coming, then folks, he's on his road here. He's coming. That's right. &gt;&gt; Pray. Now, sitting close to him, &gt;&gt; right behind him is a woman. She's got trouble with her side and she has headaches. Mrs. Arnold, if you believe with all your heart. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I do not know you. Is that right, lady? We're strangers to one another. Is that your name? Is that your condition? You were praying, wasn't you? You touched something. The man sitting right back there with high blood pressure. If you will believe, sir, we accept it as your healing. You do. Look at me gayheaded. Sure. Rinse. You can believe with all your heart. Do you, sir? All right. Then the blood pressure will leave you. I don't know him. Never seen him in my life. Is that right, sir? Raise up your hand. If we're strangers to one another, what are them people touching? And in the midst of this all, I feel doubt moving in. &gt;&gt; What are you doing? God, being merciful. &gt;&gt; Don't do that. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is your thus sayeth the Lord. I see before me a woman. She's holding a water-headed baby. &gt;&gt; The baby has had surgery. Got water on the brain. She's sitting right down here holding the baby. You know who I'm talking to? Mrs. Jagger. Stand up and believe for the baby. [Music] You believe on the Lord? [Music] If thou can't believe, how about over in this section here? So what you'll see if this is in one section, you believe over here. Do you believe it? [Music] A lady sitting here high blood pressure. If you'll believe, lady. Uh, Lord, who is she? Mrs. Bar Ly Barley. Believe with all your heart and you shall have your healing also. You believe it? What about this woman laying down here on this cop stretcher? Look over this way, lady. You have a prayer card? I guess you don't. Well, I don't think I don't forgot to tell you about prayer cards. I guess none of you don't have no prayer card. I can't heal you, lady. But do you believe if God can tell me what's your trouble, will you accept it? You're going to die laying there. That's one thing. Sure. You got an overflued body. That's fluid and everything backing up on you. Is that That's the truth, isn't it? Now, I never seen you in my life. This is the first time. And if you'll believe it with all your heart and don't doubt that fluid will leave you and you go home, be well. &gt;&gt; Do you believe? Do you believe the angel of the Lord's here? &gt;&gt; How many of you believers raise up your hand? &gt;&gt; Well, now lay your hands on one another. Put your hands on one another if you're believers. Oh, God. Holy Spirit that's present, the angel that was promised that Jesus said would be here as it was in the days of Sodom. Lord God, make Satan to leave this people. I hold on before you and zealous of them. Come out of that group, Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ. Move away from those people and be dispelled from this building and Jesus Christ take glory and power forever. Now, if you believe with all your heart, believe that he heals you. The Bible said these That's right, lady. Get right up off that cot and go on home. That's you believe. Stand up on your feet then everywhere except Jesus. The angel of the Lord is here. I pronounce the healing blessings and the power of the almighty God into your hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Or can you deny that? I say to us, this congregation, God has visited this generation. &gt;&gt; That happened thousands of times. &gt;&gt; Thousands of times. Even to one woman's name, he couldn't say, so he spelled it out first &gt;&gt; and said it. I see a woman behind. There's a man behind me standing there speaking to two auditoriums as it were. God visited this generation. I'd like to say to our American friends, there isn't one nation. There is a nation, then there's another nation. We are Canadians on this side of the border. Many of you here are Americans. As American, you have a great responsibility because God is going to hold you accountable for this ministry. &gt;&gt; God did not send it to Canada. God did not send it to England or to Germany. He sent it to America. And that is why America is the superpower today. Not because anything that the people did. It was the blessing of almighty God. And that has largely happened in just the last hundred years because you came from all corners of the earth. And God is going to hold that nation responsible for what they have done with that gift. He even said one place, if they on a national level had accepted this gift, they would have needed a hospital in the country. And one of the things that's crushing the economy right now, not only there, but in many places of the world, happens to be the health and the medical system. I'm not here to preach about politics, but you know that that is the truth. And God has said in his word that that was what was going to be at this end time. And here we are. And I only played that uh seven minutes to say to you and to confirm to you rather than me read it. Isn't it better that you hear his voice and that I can just say to you authoritatively, God visited this generation? &gt;&gt; God visited you people in India, brother Titus. God visited you mightily in Bombay with this ministry. God visited you that are here from South Africa, Johannesburg, Durban, Port Elizabeth. God visited that nation in incredible until there were truckloads and the deputy mayor of Durban calling brother Brennham to the window look out the window as seven truckloads with big rack truckloads loaded with stretchers and every kind of device for walking and braces and all kinds of things loaded wheelchairs and everything and and a complaint from the hospital they can't keep the people in the hospital because they were ordering ambulances I got the pictures in my office ambulances lined up people going out and and going in and they said, "You're going to die if you leave here." He says, "I'm going to die if I stay here." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's the kind of desperation that God honors. When a person gets a hold of the word of God and says God's not only working in the past or back in Moses' day or Abraham's day, that same God has not diminished one iota today. &gt;&gt; It is that we become self, we become like self-satisfied. We got so many things that you know to relieve your pain today and to help you along that kills our faith and destroys it. But we want to have our confidence in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God visited Abraham. God visited Sarah. God visited Moses. God visited Israel. God visited when our Lord Jesus came and God visited in our time. And God said to Abraham to rather to Jeremiah and I'm coming to this now. He said I know the thoughts that I think toward you. Let me say this congregation only God knows those thoughts and only God can make them known and God has his chosen way of making them known. And I can tell you it's not through a seminary. you trust. If you're here and you trust in a seminary, you're trusting in a failing system. &gt;&gt; It's not just through an order of men, a priesthood or a organization or individuals. You may say, "Well, what do you think you're doing?" If I echo anything other than what God has sent in this day, God, this what you just heard, that's God's vindication. How does a man stand over with a seventh grade Kentucky education and call a woman out of the audience Joerger? Another one Arnold. Another one spell her name. How does a man do that? You say, "Oh, that's some kind of mental." If anybody would think that, I say, "God forgive you. That'd be close to blasphemy." That's none other than the Holy Spirit visiting this generation, trying to get through our hardened hearts. And I pray that he'll turn our hearts from stone, turn them from stone to flesh to receive the word and then to find that that mouthpiece God begins to use because God every time he confirmed a prophet in a generation or to a people, he would send him with the necessary signs that should have turned the people's hearts back to the word of God. And then he would declare the same word, &gt;&gt; say the same thing. And now comes the messenger saying, "No, I don't want to do that." That was my first pull. That was the second pull. It pulled people. It drew people out of every organization. Drew people, attracted them this great great sign. But now the sign had a voice behind it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; A voice behind it. And the voice came so that God, listen to me, could make known his thoughts &gt;&gt; when he came to the end of all of this captivity and all of this trouble and all this slavery in Babylon. And not all of it was slavery. They had a good life. Many of them in Babylon. Many of them established businesses. Many of them stayed there. Even after the captivity was over, they stayed in Babylon. And they didn't even know the Hebrew language. That's why they had Pharisees which were answer people. They would answer the questions that the people had because they had newfound problems which they had discovered while they are living in Babylon prospering much like it is today. Don't let prosperity have you settled down. That won't that will never satisfy the thirst that's in your soul. &gt;&gt; And so when God was now ready to bring them out, he had a further word that he had not said. He had had said earlier, you're going to be there 70 years. But now when he reconfirmed it after the false prophets were were out of the way and proven to be false as they have been today &gt;&gt; tell you that it was an apple in the Garden of Eden. I say false prophet. &gt;&gt; Since someone comes up and says, "Oh, it wasn't an apple. It was an apricot." False prophet. &gt;&gt; Oh, there isn't one God. There's three gods. false prophet. &gt;&gt; You can't find it in the Bible. I am one, said God to Israel. Was he lying or was he telling the truth? That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Don't get me onto that subject. &gt;&gt; After the false prophecy, God confirms the true. Then he said, then he said something new. I I will make known my thoughts. I have thoughts concerning them. &gt;&gt; What'd he say? Thus sayith the Lord, I know I know the thoughts that I think toward you, sayith the Lord. Thoughts of peace. I said God only knows those thoughts. And those thoughts are the plan. God and God know alone knows the plan. What are the thoughts? The thoughts are the purpose. The plan and the purpose. God is saying I know the plan. &gt;&gt; He's saying I know the purpose. &gt;&gt; He's the one who knows that. And it is to make judgment to make a a decisive judgment that that is false. That is true. That is correct. This is not only God can do that. I know the thought. I know where the judgment should be. And so he has to send his his his prophet has to send a prophet who's that can never come through a human mind. That has to come through a mind. Isn't it a discernment? Even people who did not know what their sickness was, he's telling them what their sickness is. Oh my, I wish you could have been in the meetings I've been in. I wish you could have seen the things. I even prayed this morning. Oh God, if I could have a a wish, if I could have a a prayer that would come to pass. I would so love if this congregation could taste of one of those meetings and have that prophet messenger stand here and call your name and tell you your address and tell you perhaps your disease or your sickness that sometimes the people didn't even know it was there. I'd love to have him stand here and tell you I see you you were at a you were at a doctor last week &gt;&gt; and he was speaking actually there was two doctors and I hear them conversing between themselves and they want to remove an organ out of your body and that organ is a spleen. How specific can you get? How could that person doubt it? I tell you what, I don't care how quiet, how formal, what your religion is. If I had that said to me, I would rise to my feet and say, "I accept it. &gt;&gt; I accept this kind of voice. I accept this kind of wisdom. I accept this kind of plan. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the people are like. I don't care. Oh, well, they're considered a cult. So be it. &gt;&gt; They're following a man. So be it. &gt;&gt; They're following a dead man. Since when is a prophet? Since when has a believer die? Be a dead man?" Apostle Paul. If you're a Christian, you have to believe the Apostle Paul. He said, "If this body be dissolved, we have another." &gt;&gt; Not we will. We have it. Apostle Paul said that if this body's dissolved, and many bodies have been dissolved. You've said goodbye to your friends, to your loved ones. And if they're a believer, they have another body. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul says it, and the prophet of this day confirms it, saying it's a theophony. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know the thoughts I think about you. I know the plan. God knows the plan. He had to make it known. I know the purpose. Only God knows the purpose. Here, you and I, we stumble through life and we wonder, "What's the purpose of God in this? What what's the plan of God? Has God got a plan? My my life doesn't seem to be going the way I tried to organize it." God, you have to hear from God's purpose. He said in Corinthians and rather in Romans, for who hath known the mind of the Lord or who hath been his counselor who knows his thoughts, &gt;&gt; God alone knows his thoughts and he doesn't raise up he doesn't raise up just a five-fold ministry for that. He raised up a prophet and the prophet gives the word of God and the five-fold ministries to catch that word and bring it to the people. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Apostle Apostle Paul said in Corinthians, "But God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit, for the Spirit searchth all things, yay, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of man? For what man knoweth the things of man, save the spirit of man that is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God." God said, "I know my thoughts &gt;&gt; that I have towards them." And when God will make his thoughts known, and that's why I come now to this word. When God makes his thoughts known, he said, "Then you shall call upon me, and I will hearken unto you." When you have come to know what the thoughts of God are concerning the age that you're in, concerning the time that you're in, what God's decisive decision is about the the world, the condition of the world, when you discover God's plan and God's program in this j age, then you call upon him &gt;&gt; and he says, "I will hearken." Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And you shall seek me and you'll find me." &gt;&gt; Isn't that some good news? &gt;&gt; But the word seek is not over your food or just 10 seconds while you kneel at your bed at night. Say, "Lord Jesus, I'm so tired tonight. Just remember me and help me. I got this problem today." and jump into bed or just over the food. And no, you lose something valuable. &gt;&gt; You lose something that's absolutely priceless. Just priceless. You say, "I can't lose this. This is impossible. Who did it? Who had it last? Where was it last?" It's training your brain. You're thinking, "Where was it? Where did I lay it down? Where was it?" You're tearing up the cushions off of the sofa. You're going through the house. Sweep the place out. Vacuum the place out. See what you can do. Find it. Is it in the car? Take out the seats. Everything. What are you doing? You're searching &gt;&gt; for something. We're not searching for some little material thing. We're searching after the living God. &gt;&gt; What is your plan? &gt;&gt; What is your program? What is it you're trying to say to us? &gt;&gt; What is it you're speaking to my heart? What would you have me to do? And he might be laying his finger on something just now. That's why I said cleaning house. You might have found something. Say, well, you know, I've been getting this kind of circular. I've been getting this kind of magazine been getting it just keeps coming month after month or whatever more maybe some kind of conversation or some kind of relationship you have and God's laying his finger on it. Now, don't don't have to have him scream. Don't have to have him take some desperate steps. Brother Brandham says in desperation it's it's too bad. He said that sometime we need something some crisis to come and how many times I get a phone call and we've even had it recently and soon as I get a crisis phone call I I always hope I pray I hope that they're on good terms. It's not the preacher. It's the person that has to be on good speaking terms with God. I like when Peter, the angel of God came to Peter and said, "Go to the house of Cornelius and they came into the house of Cornelius." The angel that had come to Cornelius said, "Thine arms and thy prayers have come up before God." Cornelius wasn't coming in some desperation. Oh God, oh God, I'm coming to some realization. An angel comes to him says, "Your prayers, hallelujah, they'd been coming up to before God and his arms, his giving, his liberality, a Roman. &gt;&gt; Not even one under the promise, a Roman." And God sends one of his apostles to him, "Your prayers have been heard. Your prayers and your giving in your arms have come up before God for remembrance. We don't want to wait for an hour of desperation. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, pastor, pray. Call on us. We're in a great desperation." What were you doing before the desperation? Were you faithful to the house of God? Were you faithful to the work of God? Were you were you given over to to sacrifice of your life? And and and is you understand what I'm saying? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, you're saying, you might be asking, uh, should we not call when we're in emergency? Yes, of course. Of course, I'm not saying that. What I am giving you the counsel? Stay in good terms with God. Stay in a talking terms with him. Speak to him on a daily basis. Have this friendship and this relationship with him. And when the hour of crisis comes, you can look up while you're asking others for prayer. You can look up and say, "Oh God, I've walked with you to the best of my knowledge and the best of my ability, and I'm in this crisis. Help me now." &gt;&gt; You know what he said? I will hear you. said, "You shall seek me and find me when when you shall search for me with all of your heart. &gt;&gt; All of it. All of it. young people, young men, strong strapping bodies. It's not what your your profession is going to be. That's not first. That's important, but that's not first. &gt;&gt; How much you're going to make and your salary, that's not first. &gt;&gt; God is first with all your heart &gt;&gt; to search for him. Search for him. &gt;&gt; Talk to him all the time. is that when we meet on the other side and I trust by God's grace I will be there to greet you also and I trust that you'll be there to greet the other saints and myself I want to be there by his grace and I I try to examine myself every day every single day I can I believe I can honestly say not a day goes by I don't seek to examine myself brother Brandham even said and And he quoted from Apostle Paul, "Lest le I believe it's in in uh desperation also, lest after I have preached I I be a cast away." Not that he was doubting, not that he was thinking that predestination wasn't in place, but he's considering his his life and his devotion to the cause of Christ. Well, I must hurry along because I've got I've got some things I've got to say today before I before I close. And God said, "The thoughts that I think toward you in a future home said, "If there be one among you who's a prophet, I the Lord will speak to him. And if what he says happens, then that's me." Because he's not expressing his own. He's expressing my thoughts, my attributes. And so I believe that this congregation re accepts and acknowledges very readily that the voice we've heard calling people's names and so on. The purpose of that was to make his thoughts known to you on a personal level. You might say, "Oh, it' be so wonderful if you'd hear and and and and reveal my problem, my difficulty, the difficulty we have in our home or in our family or in my life. or if if he would just reveal and touch his finger, put his finger on this thing that I've struggled with all my life and it would be gone in a moment. That God is here now. All you have to do is believe the word that has been sent and that same thing will take place in this service. &gt;&gt; God's not a God who holds his folds his hands and say, "Well, now I just leave you to yourself, you people that have believed the message that I sent." No. the God who attended the message. The God who made his thoughts known. He made it known to us. And I'm going to go over some of those thoughts that he's made known. Who else? When else I don't care what church you come from, what minister you had, what priest you had, what rabbi you had, who told you that you are the virgin born bride of Jesus Christ? Whoever told you that your sins are so forgotten that God cannot remember them, that they have been confessed and dropped into the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ and even God himself can't find them. Whoever told you that &gt;&gt; listen friends, that's not just what somebody said trying to be positive. &gt;&gt; They've to they've said that so that you would be guiltree, &gt;&gt; rid of all guilt. That's not just a positive message. That is thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; The thoughts that I think toward you said in the Smian church age, listen this very closely. He God that is was known only as eternal spirit. the bride. And if you can identify with that, the bride was already in his mind. Yes, she was. She was existing in his thoughts. &gt;&gt; That's not something we believe in a in a pre-existence. But you were existing in his thoughts. And what about those thoughts of God? They are eternal, aren't they? You are existing in the thoughts of God. Can God lose a thought? Can you say ah I thought of this. I thought that it will be a certain way and I will call this individual. In fact is here's some of the thoughts of God as you were the prophet speaking as you were in the gene of your father. There's no mistake you were in the gene of your father because you're here. You've got DNA that comes down and you got your own DNA that's so unique to yourself there's no one in earth has it &gt;&gt; but you are in the gene of your father and a prophet now saying so likewise were you in the gene of your heavenly father and he says further you have only come down into the flesh to be tempted to be tempted and this is what he says after the word has been tried died. &gt;&gt; You came here not to be a carpenter or a brick layer or a housewife or just a mother. That's all part of it. That's not why you came. God sent you here. If you're a son and daughter of God, God sent you here to express a part of his word in this generation. And that part is his own attributes. &gt;&gt; It's his own attribute. And how can God lose his own attribute? He cannot lose his own attribute. He cannot lose. You say that God almighty, creator of heavens and earth, somehow is going to be overcome by Satan, by Lucifer and and and is going to lose some of his attributes. Never. &gt;&gt; I say never. &gt;&gt; Do you say amen? Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; But who told you? When did your minister tell you? When did your priest tell you? When did your rabbi tell you? When did your pastor whoever before you came to this message, whoever told you that you were a gene in your heavenly father and you came out of his loins here to manifest a part of himself. Oh, what a high calling. No wonder this should be a desperation set within our heart. May I so perfectly, may I so accurately express that part of Jesus Christ. And he says this, "These thoughts are thoughts of peace. They're not thoughts of evil." And when he said thoughts of peace, at which we know the word real well, shalom. These are thoughts of shalom. And shalom is, in case you heard it many times, but do not know what it is in Hebrew. Shalom. These are thoughts of completeness. I know the thoughts that I thought about you. And when I thought about you, I thought of completion. &gt;&gt; I thought of seeing you complete. &gt;&gt; I didn't see you in want and in need and spiritually deprived. When I think of you, he said, I think of you being complete. &gt;&gt; Complete friends, fulfilled, not only in this life, but complete. I can't be complete unless I'm completely on the other side. &gt;&gt; When I think of you, I think of completeness. Beautiful friends. May not be for everybody, but it's certainly for me. &gt;&gt; Completeness in numbers. Completeness in numbers. There's a lot of you folks sitting here as is with me. The numbers not yet quite complete. There's somebody that has to come in and experience this same birth. They have to come in. And when God thought of you, when he said, "I think when I think of you, I think of peace. I think of you being complete &gt;&gt; because he knew the age that you'd come in, there'd be something in your heart. I've said many times, I don't want to be emotional about it, but I've said many times, if I got on the other side and my children were not there, heaven can't be heaven &gt;&gt; because I'd be I wouldn't be fulfilled. I wouldn't be complete. &gt;&gt; And it does me so much good when I be able to get into this message and say God says I and he alone knows I know the thoughts I'm thinking about you &gt;&gt; and they're thoughts of peace friends. They're thoughts of completion. Isn't that worth giving yourself to saying I would be desperate for this kind of a cause? I can't be complete. How much of those things I'm holding in my heart are there with me? When I think of you, I think of soundness. Somebody might be here and we're in need in your body. It needs to be made known to you that when God thinks of you as he has thought of you, he thinks of you as being sound physically as well. &gt;&gt; Oh, if we could only grab a hold of it, if we could only catch it. I said it for myself as well. For my family as well. How many are here though have been prayed for and God has come on the scene and miraculously delivered you and healed you? He has me. When the doctor said it couldn't happen, yet God came on the scene. Why? Because it was God's thoughts. When I think of you, &gt;&gt; put your name there. When I think of you, I think of you being sound in your body. &gt;&gt; Think of you being complete. You might be enjoying good health today, but that may not be here tomorrow. Some of these things come suddenly, come quickly. on an individual. They're un uninvited, but they come not only on elderly people, but on young people. And if this is to be your case tomorrow, tell you what, I look over this congregation, there's people sitting here in this congregation that have fought with the demon of death. I see the Dingwall family here and I think of Sister Beth. Dingwal who's sitting right here. Stand up, Sister Beth. There's a lot of visitors here perhaps. Here's a girl that struggled with leukemia for eight years and was angelic all that time. I saw her so many times. Excuse me, Brother Kim. Sister Hedi. Our sister Beth was so angelic as a girl. My wife, I've shared this with my wife. I thought she's almost too good to stay. She's so angelic. Eight years, most of it in the hospital. Her record in the Edmonton hospital is almost a foot thick. And if you haven't seen her video, you owe it to yourself to see it. And the hospital in Calgary, Alberta, requires that every person that comes in diagnosed with her kind of a case must see her video, which was done right here in this platform. And it's gone around the world. Sister Amanda Snow, Amanda, you're are you here? She's not here just now. fought with the same devil. And the medical team trying to tell her from time to time, even since she's been here, well, you have it. It It's here and it's this and it's that. And her mother's standing here nodding her head in affirmative. But God keeps coming on the scene saying it's not there. &gt;&gt; And the medical team says it is there. Do we believe in doctors? We think they're fine people and we think God uses them. That's exactly what the prophet says. God can heal through a doctor. A doctor doesn't do the healing. He can only assist it. &gt;&gt; And any good doctor will tell you that. He can only assist it. But we have testimony here also. &gt;&gt; I go to a doctor. I have a family doctor, which is fine. But uh uh we have things and and doctors can't go any further. And the prophet says when when the doctor when his ability ceases, that's just where God begins. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? I'm thankful for this word. &gt;&gt; But we can have all the healings. I'm not interested me merely in healings, friends. I'm interested in what the prophet of God has said concerning this word. And what a living word it is. &gt;&gt; Give me a few more minutes, please. This is where I want to come to. When I think of you, I think of peace, your welfare, your prosperity in this day and age. And I don't care what your particular station in life is. This is a tough one. God says, "When I think of you, my thoughts are thoughts of peace." And that peace was quiet tranquility. I think of you having a quiet spirit. I think of you having a tranquil time. Oh, I know we're busy. We're in even desperation, but you can be tranquil. Even in desperation, &gt;&gt; you can be tranquil and be busy. You can have a quiet spirit and still be very much under pressure because by the same token, he said pressure is good for us because pressure shows us what we are. But in the midst of the in the midst of the fiery furnace, you can be tranquil. In the midst of the lion's den, you can be tranquil. We are not maybe in Daniel's lion's den or in the Hebrew children's furnace, but we have our own circumstance which can have the same effect. And then I want to come quickly to this and I'm going to be ending on this part that you can come to an expected end. My thoughts are thoughts of peace. They're not thoughts of evil. to give you. Now, his thoughts, now please follow me. Don't Don't tie our moment. My thoughts are to give you. My thoughts, what I've made known, what I've revealed through my prophet messenger, what I've revealed, the intent is that it will give you an expected end. And this is very very very marvelous, very wonderful, very unusual because it's unusual because it isn't what we think it would be. The word expected, the first the first meaning of that word is it's a cord. A cord like a rope. A cord. And if you were to do it, find where it's used in the Bible, the first time it's used in the Bible is when the two spies in Joshua were sent to Jericho and the city's going to be destroyed and there's a harlot whose name is Rahab has her house on the wall and it's the walls that are going to fall. She's in the most precipitous place. She's in the most critical spot. She's on the very spot that's going to crumble. and the spies come to her and after their visit with her and the things and the conversation that took place, she's gripped with a desperation. &gt;&gt; She said, "Our our knees have turned to water. Our the hearts of our people are smitten because we've heard what God has done for Israel. We've heard of the great things that God has done in this nation for these people. Let me tell you, my brother, my sister, the echo of the testimony of what God has done through you, through this message, you you can't even write it in volumes of books. It has rippled out far and wide. Many have heard about it. Many have been affected by it. It's not some weak little testimony. It's something powerful and it keeps reverberating and people try to shut it out of their minds but they can't get rid of it. Your life, your home, your family, your testimony keeps sounding out year after year after year. We have a brother in the church. Brother Ken Buckles are just looking for him was sitting at a table in Japan because he's a jet pilot. sitting at a table in Japan or Taiwan, believe it was in Japan, with a group of the airline staff, and they just got talking about some program that's on the television. He said, "Well, I don't have a television." They said, "Do you go to Ed Biscll's church?" and he's sitting in he's sitting in Japan around the table after a long flight just having a a little bit to eat and they're talking about he's talk about a testimony that's a minor part of it but I I tell you what what what brought that to their mind &gt;&gt; something registers &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; I'm glad I'm in this church too &gt;&gt; I'm glad we have this word to fellowship around. &gt;&gt; But Rahab said, "I want a true token that you will not destroy me." So now the token and the prophet said, Tom quoted this morning, "For your own safety first, not because you only think of yourself first, but before you can give it to someone else, you need to experience it." &gt;&gt; You apply the token to your own life first, then let it echo out. Let it vibrate out. And she said, they said, "Take this scarlet cord. Take this scarlet expected end." Exactly the same word. Take this token. This will be a token to you and put it in the window. And now I saw something that was so priceless and so beautiful to me. I've been meditating it on it for the last couple of days. bind it in the window. And it actually means to and she now she didn't just bind it in the window. I didn't she didn't stick it on with some, you know, tape. I'm sure she put it in that window so it wasn't going to come out. She was going to fasten it there because she was now listen now. She her whole life became entwined with that cord. &gt;&gt; It wasn't that the cord was just bound in the window. She was bound to the cord. &gt;&gt; And when she looked at that cord, it was in the window. She couldn't look at that without thinking, "I'm safe. &gt;&gt; I'm safe. God's men gave me a promise. I'm saying I cannot be destroyed. She didn't have to worry about how are the walls going to go down? What's going to happen to all this mortar? What's going to happen with all these stones? All she knew is I'm saved. &gt;&gt; I'm bound to the promise. I'm bound to this cord. &gt;&gt; And that's my expected my expected end is safety. &gt;&gt; And that was all she knew. That was all she knew. But God had something further in mind for her. &gt;&gt; In that cord that she was bound to was a husband. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In that cord she was bound to was a son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That son was Boaz. In that cord, in that cord that she was actually entwined with was her expected end, it was a husband and all her provisions for the rest of her life. All that she would need in that core that she was entwined with was a son, Boaz, who would redeem Ruth, &gt;&gt; who would give life to Oed, who would give life to Jesse, which would bring forth the king of Israel. That was all in that cord. &gt;&gt; There was one last thing in the cord. She didn't know. It was revealed to her as time went on in that cord that she was bound to. She was actually entwined and inshed with the very lineage of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The word that has been sent to you, my brothers, my sister, I feel authorized of almighty God to tell you uh bind yourself to the token. &gt;&gt; Bind yourself to the word. Bind yourself to what the Holy Spirit makes real to you. Bind yourself to it. Entwine your life with it. Because in so doing, in that is your very husband, the Lord Jesus Christ. In that gives you your lineage, right? Back in the same prophecies, you are in look look at what what no one else can tell you, but you are in the father. You're in your heavenly parent. You're in his loins. You're in his gene. sitting here today in this church is the gene of almighty God has come down in the flesh. &gt;&gt; The gene of almighty God brought you here for one purpose that he could put his word in you and express it through you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? She was bound. And brother Brandham in desperation, he says, "The little harlot Rahab, she was desperate. She knew that death laid before her. She was under judgment." And she got desperate and said, "I'll hide you spies. I'll do anything. Only swear. Swear to your God that my house will stand. In desperation, she bound herself to the scarlet cord and in binding herself. He also said, and the scripture said, she saved her mother, she saved her father, she saved her brothers, she saved her sisters. You might say, "That sounds too good." I don't care how it sounds. That's what the word of God says and that's what the prophet of God says. And there's all kinds of you folks here. You say, "I I've been praying for my son. I've been praying for my daughter. I'm praying for my children. I'll give you a promise. That token which could only come in the evening time. That token which the Holy Spirit has brought. That token which is the word of God. that token. It's not a phrase. It's not just a Wednesday night service where I say it's a life lived out. You are to apply the token. You are to apply it to somebody else. And maybe it'll take more than one application. You apply it by a life lived out. You apply it today and you'll apply it again. And don't forget, as I said Wednesday, you might have to apply it one way to one person, apply it another way to another person. But just keep applying that lived out life. Maybe to one person, they won't let you speak to them. They won't let you. Well, then don't speak to them. Just talk. Just live the life in front of them. Let your life speak out. &gt;&gt; I was telling someone yesterday, I've been called many, many times to go to a place. Sometimes the wife's a believer, the husband is not. The husband's a believer, the wife is not. The young person becomes a believer, the parents are not. And the family gets so the the family the the the relationship within the family becomes so tense, it's absolutely explosive. And I've been asked to come and visit. When I go there and the door opens, could cut that with a knife. This is tense. to walk in. And I have just a little a little secret. You know, you learn that after you've had your ears boxed a few times, you learn a few secrets. And one of the secret is let the surprise be no surprise. Don't say anything because they're expecting, you know, to be blasted. They're expecting you're going to tell them everything. Here comes the preacher now. Oh yeah. That's the last thing. It needs a preacher. The reason I look around the audience sometime is I'm looking for somebody because I get ready to tell their testimony. One of them I'll just tell this much. I won't say whoever or who it is, but it was a situation. It was a husband wife situation. It was critical. How critical? They had already identified. Well, that'll be yours in the divorce and I'll take that and you can have the sofa and I'll take this and you take that and I'll have the microwave. And so they had everything all sorted out who was taking who and as a last death wish said would you mind if I had brother Ed come over I don't care you know you want to have him over like last death wish so I came over and atmosphere and uh the sister she might be here this morning she's here most of the time she was in a pair of jeans and had her feet up on the coffee table smoking a cigarette And the husband says, "Oh, dear. Uh, here's Brother Ed." She goes, "Hi." I thought, "Boy, we got a long ways to go." So, the evening went on and on and on and on and on and I just had nothing. You know, we just talked about life, talked about things. The prophet though gave us keys. So, I was busy looking for my key. which key do I use on this one? But one wonderful key is he says just talk about what they like to talk about. You know, if they're a farmer, talk about farming. So I thought, well, she's a mother. She's got some kids, so I'll talk about her kids. I'll talk about being a mother. And man, when we got on to that, oh, just talking about the kids and how different the kids are, and we couldn't get talking about the kids and all about the kids. And finally, uh, the night is over. Time for me to go home. about 10:30 or so and I said uh called her by name and I said you know I said uh I don't know have any questions I said I may not be able to answer them. I said, "But if you have any questions, you know, I'd be happy to answer them if I can, but I know the evening's gone on." And she and she started breaking down right away, right then. And she called her husband by name. She says, "And she can't even talk. He tells me my baptisms of of the devil." I tell you, the door was open. She opened it. I didn't have to open it. She just kicked the door open. And I I walked in, I said, "Well, I wouldn't say that, but she was in the baptismal tank in about two weeks." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I was able to baptize her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Just, you know, let let the conversation be something that that they opened the door. &gt;&gt; So, I didn't say anything. Let her open the door. And that's But I think quite frankly, I think I applied something there. I think that God allowed me to apply something there. And so with one year, real quiet, with another one, it's altogether different. But what are we doing? Giving them the expected end, &gt;&gt; a tiepost. And friends, I close with that. You folks here, you believers of this message, God's given you a tiepost, a cord, an expected end. And that cord is actually to bind you also. When did you hear about your theophony body? Did you ever hear about your theophony body? I wonder if there's anyone in this in this house in this congregation that ever heard that you had a theophony body. I want to know if anyone told you outside of coming from the message and I'd be happy to I'd be happy to know because I'd like to see after the service ask you where you heard it, where it came from. I would really want to know. I'm sincerely interested. If you are, you could just raise your hand. Yeah. I heard all about my theophony body long before I came to the message and long before I was in contact with anybody from the message. It's so clear in the Bible, but I never heard about it. So, what's a prophet for? Prophets would take you to the word and give you a tiepost. &gt;&gt; Who ever heard? Some of you been in Bible school. No, but now it goes into detail. In absolute detail. And God said, "Let us make man in our image." And you skipped around that. Then God said in in Genesis 2, "Now I'll form man out of the soil of the earth. And from that man came a woman, and from the woman came you, but we skipped around that first one. You skipped around it. And the whole program is we came through a sexual birth and we come through this world and we live in our age." But God sends his word to retie retrieve his children and bring them back to that one they skipped around. When do we hear that? Do you know what friends? I'm not a young man anymore but more and more that's a tiepost for me. Prophet has told me you have a theophony. Apostle Paul said if this wouldn't be dissolved I read it many times. I didn't know exactly what it meant. If your if this body be dissolved, if this tabernacle of this body be dissolved, we have another &gt;&gt; eternal &gt;&gt; that's without beginning without end &gt;&gt; in the heavens in another realm in another dimension. So provides right beside you. &gt;&gt; You have a tiepost, &gt;&gt; a token, &gt;&gt; a typost gives you some comfort and that's great comfort. And then the future home. So we got a tiepost in life. Then the future home. And he comes and tells us you you came here this way so that the word could be tried in you. And then when this life is over and when the trial of the word is over, not your trial, but when the trial of the word is over, God's proving his word in you. When that trial is over, then you'll go to a future home. Oh, what a place a future home. My theophony that's beside me is a young man. And the theophony beside some of you young ladies and young men is perhaps just a little bit older than you are. But it will be in your in the perfection of what God had in his mind. The picture he took of you in his mind and all the rest of you right beside you. That ought to be a tiepost. That's your expected end right beside you. An expected end. And God said, "I made my thoughts known to you so that you would know what your expected end is." And that is your tiepost. How wonderful. &gt;&gt; We're on our way to a future home, little bride of Jesus Christ. We're on our way to our future home. Isn't it marvelous? &gt;&gt; I want to sing a little bit about that if the musicians will come. Now, just so you don't think that I was just saying this of my own self, but brother Brandham reads and quotes first 2 Corinthians 5:1, "If this earthly body be dissolved, this earthly tabernacle, we have another." And these are his words. When but when the testing of his word is over then we are taken up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world. It is the word there that we skipped to come around to come right around down here to be tempted and tested. It was the word we skipped around. They gave Rahab a a cord and she didn't know fully what it is. And I want to say to this congregation today, let's act. Let's act in the same measure that Rahab act in desperation. Even her not knowing what the full measure of that cord was, what that token was. And I'd like to say to you, you have a message. You've received a word. But without belittling what you believe, let me say to you, you in no wise know the full measure of what God has in store in your token. There's no way for you to know it. No way for you to know it. Eye has not seen, neither is ear heard what God has prepared for them. But the spirit is attempting to make it known to us, reveal it to us. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. I want to sing It Is Well with my soul. I believe it's 5:48. And if you would stand with me before we sing, I'd like to pray. Dear heavenly father, oh, how I thank you for your word. How I thank you for these treasures. How I thank you, oh God, for what you have made known. And I want to Lord, before this congregation of people and all who may be connected with us, I want to make my personal declaration. Thank you, oh my father, for making known your thoughts. And in making known your thoughts, you have spoke peace to my soul. And I know that you have spoken peace to a multitude that is here today. You have spoken peace and your thoughts are not thoughts of evil but of peace and to give us an expected end to give us a token to give us a typost to give us a cord. And I say, "Oh God, in my prayer today at the close of this service, with all that is in me, Lord, I've entwined myself with this cord. And I pray it'll be an example to others to entwine themselves, to involve every part of their lives, their job, their home, their families, their worship in all parts, every aspect of their life. Oh God, may it be entwined. And if it is something that wouldn't fit in with the token life, may they may they get rid of that. May they let go of it. May they sanctify themselves and live, oh God, that life which indeed is a token life. In the name of Jesus Christ, I call for your blessings to be upon this congregation. And may they take these things, Father. I pray they will take them and allow them to be pondered deep within their heart in the name of Jesus and for his glory alone. Amen. When peace like a river, like a river, attend my way. And I see [Music] I want thou me to say it is well. It is well with my soul. It is well [Music] with my soul. It is well. It is well with my soul. No, [Music] no trials. &gt;&gt; Yes. And this blessed [Music] my child has made it for my soul. It is well with my soul. With my soul. It is well. It is well with my soul. My sing [Music] all his glorious [Music] my not [Music] [Applause] to the cross and I no more. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Oh my soul is well [Music] with my soul. My soul is well. It is well with my soul &gt;&gt; and Lord haste the day when my face shall be as a [Music] has found the Lord shall even with my soul. &gt;&gt; It is well &gt;&gt; with my soul. &gt;&gt; with my soul. Well, [Music] my soul, this last verse is like an anthem to the believers. If you don't like singing and you don't like worship and you don't like heavenly music, don't come to my corner of heaven. So, I'm going to solicit everybody I can. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful, kids? We can sing with everything that's in us. I you hear at some sports events and boy, sometimes they're almost deafening. I like it. I like people that are enthusiastic, but I like people enthusiastic about their salvation. Where else can we do it? &gt;&gt; You can't do it at Bellis Fair. &gt;&gt; At least I don't hear it there. You can't do it at Willowbrook. &gt;&gt; You don't do it on the street. They'll lock you up. But you can do it here. &gt;&gt; You can do it here. &gt;&gt; Oh my sin. Not in part, but the whole ought to throw everybody into desperation. &gt;&gt; And if you're here today and you haven't got that experience, don't let the devil lie to you. &gt;&gt; Realize the devil can't tell you the truth. &gt;&gt; Don't live part way. Don't live just with a half victory. Live it to the full. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do I get a support from this congregation? Live it to the full. Enjoy it. Be fulfilled. His thoughts toward you is to completion. Be fully satisfied, fully content, full of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; This last verse, the sky, not my, not the grave is our goal. But &gt;&gt; for weigh the sky of the grael [Music] and The Lord [Music] my soul [Music] is well. It is well with my soul. With my soul is well [Music] with my soul. But Lord haste the day for thy coming. [Music] the sky. Lots of great [Music] [Music] soul. [Music] It is well with my soul. [Music] It is well [Music] with my soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise to God. Are you here without this hope? I wish that you would have it. &gt;&gt; Don't deny him. &gt;&gt; He's here to give you this completion. May God reach through to you by his word and by his spirit is my prayer. We're not after people to join this church. We're after people to be included in the bride body of Jesus Christ. May God grant it is my prayer. I'll be so rewarded if just one, even one, young or old, man or woman or child can receive him in the full redemption, full measure of his redemption. God grant it. I pray can ask brother Tony Ab if you'll come pray a prayer of blessing upon this people. There's no service this evening while we're preparing now for this camp. No no no evening service on Sundays until after the when school starts again. And brother Tony, would you come please? Heavenly Father, truly the sky is our goal. Lord, that completeness of being united with you, Lord. That's what our heart and our soul longs for, Lord. How we have been brought to the knowledge and the revelation that this is what you desire, Lord. This is what was in your mind and in your thoughts, Lord, before the foundation of the world, that you would have a body. You would have a bride. you would have a people that would so emulate the love that you have shown to them. And Lord, here we are, your people, Lord, rejoicing in your great gift of love and forgiveness of sins. Lord, those who were, Lord, trapped in these bodies of sin. You have forgiven. You have justified us. We are now the word made flesh, oh God, because of your spirit living within us. Oh, what blessed thoughts these are, Lord. how that we've been enjoined into the very lifream of eternal God himself. Oh father, as we would go from this place today, Lord Jesus, may the reality of these thoughts so permeate our lives, permeate our thinking, permeate our actions, Lord, that we would be nothing less than God being expressed in this sinful world. Bless your people. We pray how we thank you for the word. Thank you for Lord a obedient humble servant to deliver the burden that you have given to him. Lord may we be strengthened to go forth and live this life to the fullness. Lord let us not be ashamed for this glorious gift that you've given to us. How we thank you and rejoice in it now. Bless your people as we would go forth Lord in the power of your spirit as we ask all these mercies. And everyone said amen. Amen. Brother Tony, God bless you. We dismiss you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Go and live this life. I say to you in the name of the Lord, apply this token. Apply it to somebody. When you walk out of here, just say, "Who am I going to apply this to? I'm going to apply this life." God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] Halleluah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] I feel. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh, [Music] hey. [Music] [Music]
