The wind started violently blowing, but he was asleep in the stern. Does he not care that we perish? We're helpless and oh so afraid. But Jesus arose when they called him. And he said to them, "Where is your faith? Cuz you've prayed all night and you've held on with all your might. Shout your Christ have awoken the master. Oh he knows your voice. Lift your hand this time to rejoice. down your Christ have awoken the master hit you without any warning. The storm of your life had begun.

I have uh a few things that I would like to just mention, not by way of announcement so much, but it is announcement. I want to certainly welcome those that have remained over from the wedding and Sister Linda's parents. I believe are remaining in the area and perhaps here this morning. We are thankful for that. Uh it's now Mr. and Mrs. Adamora, &gt;&gt; David Adamora. And I'm so thankful for the wedding was lovely. It was appropriate. So appropriate. It was so perfect. It was very, very nice. Our brother Joseph Olafi from Nigeria is going to be speaking for us on Wednesday. This Wednesday &gt;&gt; and we'll want to all be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. For certain, for certain you won't want to miss our brother Joseph. I wonder if you could stand, please. And this is brother I talk from Nigeria. This is his pastor, brother I talk. if you would stand. We know, brother, I talk well. God bless you. And I'm sorry, brother Joseph, that uh you would have been speaking this morning, but uh I've been away and I think that it's all right. Amen. God bless you. You may have your seat. Uh, also I wanted to uh make a comment. Last Wednesday's service, I wasn't in service. Brother John Andy's was speaking and uh it was a really a very profound service. &gt;&gt; If you haven't heard that service, you want to go back and get it on the archives. It is streaming. I live streamed it. I was at home uh still recovering and uh so uh but it was it was just uh I was completely locked in from the very moment it opened up and I want to thank you brother John for your uh labor of of love and effort. Uh there is just so much but I'm going to be quick. um the Lynen Witness booth and the street witnessing that has been taking place. I've just heard from a number I've heard from quite a few. Thank you, brother Matthew Redell for your efforts. And brother Matthew has said uh the week at the Lynen Fair has been con confirmed by most to be the most fruitful, spiritual and supernatural week we have ever had. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful news? Amen. &gt;&gt; And literally hundreds of conver conversations and witnessing has taken place and we have had such an incredible turnout that every day we are sending numerous ones on the streets uh to contact those coming and going from the fair. Countless testimonies there alone. Uh we have had ones asking for prayer, surrendering their lives, asking so many questions, countless uh countless quality witnesses and no no way to begin to share it this way, which was just by by way of email. So, brother Matthew, most all of us know you, of course, but I'd like you to stand first and then I would like all who were involved in the Lynden fair one way or another. Whether it's preparing here, I would like you to stand, please. All that were at the fair, all that were witnessing, all that were on the streets, all that were here. It's quite a number. Isn't that a impressive number? &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you for your part. You should be happy that you've had this part. Amen. God bless you. And uh Brother John Andy's also he sent uh he said, "I wanted to send a positive report." This was an email to myself uh of the Lynen Fair witnessing booth. I just returned home from being at the fair booth. I feel by far it was the most successful spiritually effective years so far. The believers was fantastic. The witnessing was very powerful. The testimony was 100% positive. The booth was kept clean and very presentable all week. The you never know what a person is looking at, do you? uh the show of force and presence of the believers was powerful and most often overwhelming. This was in caps a very good year &gt;&gt; for the for the ones that was affected and spoken to. It was great for our people and congregation that participated. It was fantastic. The sisters and the brothers all did so wonderful. I have nothing negative to say. Truly, we are in another book of acts. &gt;&gt; I am impressed and overwhelmed by brother Matthew Redell was superb. Uh he is excellent. He was very good with our people and dynamic and unwavering. Very successful year. Praise the Lord. And I think everyone should say, "Praise the Lord." Amen. I will just say a very few words. You'll probably hear maybe more later from uh those that were attending. But uh we were attending the convention in Germany and uh they had uh announced it as being an international convention and I guess it was indeed international in its uh in its uh attendance and so on uh from this church. Brother Tim Dodd, brother Murphy Wong, brother Mil Rathbar and also attending was sister Melissa Snow and Sister Hopi Robinson. uh attended from the Cloverdale Bible Way Church. Uh there were others that were streaming. One night I walked in on uh one of the evenings and uh Brother David Mayor's nephew was uh look, he's just a young fellow. He would just fit right in. He's probably 19 years old, but he was looking after all the IT work and all the streaming. And just as I passed in, he said, "There are 90 countries connected just now." &gt;&gt; That was truly international, I guess, in that sense of the word. Uh we we were just happy for that. And we were happy for brother Coen Brunner, Senior, who he and his family did almost all the work that was involved. They don't run their camp quite like we do, but they at the camp the his family looked after all the bookings, all the rooms and scheduling people and the coming from the airport at uh Stogart and on the way. Uh so there are things behind the scenes that we don't notice and we don't often talk about. My wife and I, we don't often talk about our our difficulties, but I got a text. I'll just say this and then forget it. Uh because the words more important, but I got a text early early the day of our departure saying that our plane was 4 hours late. And uh all right. So, I got on the phone right away immediately with agents of Lufanza. And I said, uh, you know, uh, we need to be, uh, we've got another flight going to Stogart. And I said, well, you won't make that one. This flight would arrive now 3:30 in the morning in Frankfurt. And, uh, she said, but I'll see if we can reroute you and get you uh, to Munich. There's a big plane leaving to Munich every day out of Vancouver. So, nevertheless, they got us booked on that flight. And I said, "Well, we need all this big jumbo 747 now isn't going to get there. They're going to be in a big rush at the airport for seats." So, I said, "We need to get there early." So, we attempted to get there early, but there was indeed a big rush. And uh they didn't hardly have any seats, but they got us on on the plane. And then when we got boarded, we sat there for 2 hours at the gate. It's nice. It's if you like the inside of planes. And uh so we sat there for two hours and I after we finally got going, you know, the problem was I couldn't find a tractor to push us away from the gate. Couldn't find one. It was in the shop someplace. So anyway, we we got off, we got flying, and we're in the air. And so when I arrived, when we arrived and Linda uh was with us, uh she's looking after looking after her mother and doing things and so on, you know. So we arrived and uh uh we only had just a few minutes to catch this other flight that was going to get us to Stoodgard. and we're racing around and I'm trying to talk to staff and and oh no, that flight's been cancelled. Okay, how are we going to get there? Well, we're going to get a bus and take you there and just go down and get your bags and so go through immigration, all the rest of it. So, uh you want the short word for it? It was a nightmare, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we had it in the daytime. So anyway, whenever I go to the airport because uh we're preaching the gospel, I always say to my wife now, now as we go to the airport, the devil's trying to kill us. That's my common phrase which I have I have I have a lot of confirmation for that over all the 25 or 30 years. The devil's trying to kill us. And uh I remember when brother uh brother Gail Ashdown, he had never been on a plane apparently. So I got him on a plane and he came to India with us. That was a nice flight to India to Singapore and then on to India. And uh while we're there amongst the masses of just seas of people just parting as the and the taxis don't slow down, they just they just roar down the street. And the people I thought they're going to kill somebody, you know, we're going to end up here with some dead bodies. And uh the people just, you know, flow out and then flow back in just like the water, you know, and we're driving down. And now I understand why they blow the horn every couple seconds. They just blow the horn and uh Brother Gil was with uh the camera in the front seat. He and the camera, his friend. And uh he just turned around quickly. He said, "Brother Ed, just tell me I'm not in a nightmare." I said, "No, you're you're here and and uh everything is fine." So, but brother Gil put together a wonderful video that you all have seen of India &gt;&gt; and we had that video and it was played for nine years it was used. So, that's wonderful. Well, we've come to hear the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm feeling good and you're feeling good and Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. We'll have you stand and we'll turn to the book of Hebrews the 10th chapter. And before we read, I would like to have prayer. Thank you musicians. Let's just bow in prayer. Father, we come in humbly realizing that the efforts of man uh can accomplish nothing for the kingdom of God. We just surrender ourselves &gt;&gt; and we we pray that somehow we will be able to by the Holy Ghost to say something of value, something, oh God, of eternal value, something that will be food for the sheep and deliverance for those that may be bound. There may be someone here yet not knowing you as their savior. Oh, blessed, lovely Lord Jesus. How can anyone go through this life without knowing you? This is a mystery. So I pray, Father, you will achieve and of any that you have chosen and are elected and predestinated to the gospel of Jesus Christ. May it come through today loud and clear. And may they, oh God, receive you. I pray, oh Lord Jesus, that you'll receive us as we just submit ourselves to you. We pray that you will bless the congregation that have come, each one every place they may be in the bride of Jesus Christ throughout the world. We ask in Jesus name for your glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read from Hebrews the 10th chapter and usually I start just at the fifth verse, but I would like to start at the first verse of the 10th chapter. And we'll read for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect. I would like to just emphasize can never &gt;&gt; can never &gt;&gt; can never &gt;&gt; because it was the works of man and the efforts of man and the resources of man and the slaying of animals can never &gt;&gt; with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect. And he a he answers why in a moment. For then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have no more conscience of sins. &gt;&gt; But in should have no more conscience of sins. That's the objective. &gt;&gt; Every year you're reminded you're a sinner. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That wasn't pleasing to God. And so he said they should have no more conscience of sin. But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. &gt;&gt; For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. Take away sins. Wherefore when he cometh into the world, when Jesus that is, when he cometh into the world, he saith, sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared me? All right. What kind of a body? Something that'll take away sin. &gt;&gt; Something that will remove the conscience, &gt;&gt; the guilt. &gt;&gt; This is amazing. And he said, "In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin, thou which had no pleasure." Then said I, Lo, I come in the volume of the book, it is written of me to do thy will, oh God, above when he said, sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offerings for sin, thou wouldst not, neither hast pleasure therein, which are offered by the law. Then said he, "Lo, I come to do thy will, oh God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now I read an extra verse there. All right. God bless you as you have your seats. Now, I know I have used this title perhaps even here before. But I just want to be very open with the congregation. Uh I have been sometimes the Lord really causes a person to grind out in their heart and in their soul and in the depth of their spiritual understanding. I have something I want to convey to you. So you need to it'll be more like a study but I'd like you to follow very very closely. We have quite a bit of reading and I have it on the screen for you as well because uh I would have to go to so many places in the scripture. Brother Brandham condensed it marvelously in the message the invisible union of the bride of Jesus Christ. And I I want you to be able to read it yourself because it will have a greater impact and it'll be necessary. But some things for a background first uh he said low I come in the volume of the book I want to describe to you and suggest to you that each one of you are actually a a book within itself. It is not only that your name is in a book, but your name is representative of your life. &gt;&gt; You are a book. We can say the pages of the book perhaps are the days of our life we're living it. Uh uh or the chapters we say, well, I'm I'm in a new chapter of life. Sometimes it might be uh you know uh a season or a year or it might be a season of of life. And now I'm in another chapter of my life. Uh the this book is a lot of words. We call it the Bible, the word of God. And it's a a lot of words on paper. Uh and if if it just remains there as a word or as verses &gt;&gt; or as promises or as commandments, if it just remains there, uh that's all it is is a dead letter &gt;&gt; until until it becomes lived out by someone. then it becomes a living force because now we see visibly what that says. Amen. &gt;&gt; But now if there's a if it's a promise, &gt;&gt; then if the unseen God &gt;&gt; who made the promise actually fulfills it &gt;&gt; in a person's life or within the age or a time of life or prophesies things that might be of a global scale and it happens and there were prophecies and and promises towards Israel as a people and there are promises towards you sitting here today. There are promises but they might they'll just be dead letter unless someone is effective with their faith and believes it. &gt;&gt; Says I I believe that. &gt;&gt; So that's kind of where we're where we're going just a wee bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says now a body hast thou prepared me? this word prepared. It's uh I I thought what kind of a body? So I began to look at that what kind of a body all these thousands and thousands of animals that were slain and you almost uh to the human mind and I have to be honest I have often marveled how how is God the creator of heavens and earth what what satisfaction does he get that there's slaying beasts and bulls and sheep and goats son animals by the thousands is an incredible thing. And yet somehow that was uh describing the awfulness of sin. It was also describing that there had to be bloodshed. It was an incredible cost, incredible thing. But the people slew animals by the thousands. Now we have a scripture apostle Paul writing and saying thou hast had no pleasure in that &gt;&gt; that didn't satisfy the penalty &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and that had to be done every year and one of the big things is God did not want his children to be reminded every year &gt;&gt; they're sinners &gt;&gt; he wanted to do away with sin there had to be something more effective more powerful, more glorious &gt;&gt; than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and that uh now comes the son of God, Jesus Christ himself, who was the word made flesh, virgin born. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't come through human effort. &gt;&gt; Didn't come, listen close now, didn't come by man or woman's effort, &gt;&gt; but came as a virgin birth. Yes. uh Mary had to bear him and and she gave birth to him and he died he was born as a man and died as a man but it was God in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You agree with that? &gt;&gt; And so to be prepared now I got thinking of the body. Uh now the prophet said that God was in Moses, &gt;&gt; God was in Abraham. &gt;&gt; God was in these saints. Now I'm I'm you you you might not understand me till I get to the end of the service. So hang on to this. Now I thought, well, Abraham back there, he actually lied. And the prophet said he backslid. He went into another country, which he shouldn't have done, and he lied about his wife. And here you've got him be contributing to a body, a sinless body. But they actually did. Then you have Moses who slew uh murdered an a an Egyptian and buried him in the sand as and and he's he's uh acting out a redeemer of Christ &gt;&gt; and he and Christ was in him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So now you have you have something happening here that's very very important in order to understand grace. Now if I'm losing you don't don't don't don't let don't don't let go now. Don't shut off your mind. &gt;&gt; Now you've got people that actually uh did error. Uh they eroded they sinned. They did wrong. David and others, men and women. Rahab was a harlot, but she was in the motherhood of Christ. And you have these others that were certainly deficient in a lot of ways. But now on that side of the in the Old Testament, you have in this side, you have these, and we're talking about the body hast thou prepared me? We're talking about the sinless &gt;&gt; lamb of God. &gt;&gt; So somehow somehow &gt;&gt; God had God had in his mind that he's going to deal with these things &gt;&gt; or this God had the ability to obliterate and do away and wash away and loose sin from people. And I'll tell you it I'll just give you the key word. It's election. &gt;&gt; It's election. &gt;&gt; If God elects someone to be his son, &gt;&gt; that's it. &gt;&gt; That's touch for me. That's that's the end of it. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And God is the only one that can have a sea of forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; You have a memory. I have a memory. &gt;&gt; And unfortunately, Satan has access to that. And we can remember our wrongs every day or every year. And that that by remembering them is not pleasing to God. And it's belittling of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Calvary actually annihilated sin. &gt;&gt; Calvary dealt a blow to Satan and sin. &gt;&gt; And at Calvary, he crushed the serpent's head. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And we're going to come to the new side, the New Testament. The bridegroom fulfills the old and the bride fulfills the new. &gt;&gt; We're going to come to the New Testament. And here are you and I with our weaknesses and our frailties and our memories of our past and all these things. What what does this uh I'm going to be very very honest with you. &gt;&gt; Does this make up a part of a spotless bride? Yes, it does. &gt;&gt; It happens to make up a part of a spotless bride. And we have things inbuilt in our character and in our nature &gt;&gt; and our our problem is one of our big problems. Now I'm going to come right into your address &gt;&gt; is the nature that came to you by your natural birth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And many of the problems that people suffer today or are uh they are dealing with today are are of of our natural nature &gt;&gt; where well I was kind of born that way. Uh I was born with uh you know a certain gift or certain talents or whatever more and we were born to where we would we could remember things and it's a problem. &gt;&gt; It's a problem. And then uh I find things today I've done a lot of counseling and the brothers behind me have done a lot of counseling. A lot of our counseling is from uh it it comes from I'm just want to be careful with my words but it comes from we could say natural life but it also comes from human nature and human character &gt;&gt; and that needs to be dealt with &gt;&gt; in the light of the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. in the light of the scripture in the and a lot of the ailments today are because people are have not got a full grasp of the grace of God. &gt;&gt; In fact is I find things in the life and ministry of William Brandham where the grace is so great &gt;&gt; and he does things and I I have to confess I'm not there yet. I just can't do that. I I can't I can't uh uh just forgive the things that are do you know he was said you know that this is being said about you ah he said you know that's just a a predestinated problem that's just a predestinated I haven't I haven't come there many times I sometimes I have that an abundant part of grace and then other times I think well I I if I he were around here I would tell him a thing or two. &gt;&gt; Oh, you've never felt that way, have you? &gt;&gt; Yeah, you have. &gt;&gt; You know how I know you have. I don't care where you're from. I don't care what what your background is. I don't care where you were born. I don't care who your parents were. But God has directed me. And I have wrestled with this message for about a month or a month and a half. And I know it's for a people. And uh I touched on it in Edmonton and I touched on it over in Germany, but then when I was done uh it says it's for home. &gt;&gt; It's for home. &gt;&gt; And so I thought, well, that's good because then I'll be home and I can just &gt;&gt; say it. &gt;&gt; Amen. and you that are visiting, you can just tuck it away someplace and you'll pull it out in a few days or a month or so and say, you know, that that's uh yeah, he touched on some things. All right. Incidentally, while we were in while we're in Germany, you young men that are here, uh the meetings were all over, 14 of them. And in one week, and I went to church 10 times and preached three of them. So, I've we we had a fairly heavy schedule. And uh I didn't see this young man, very very fine young man, handsome uh young man from Nigeria. And uh uh we got driven out to Stoutgart. Now everybody's breaking up going every which direction and so forth. And I was talking to someone in the hotel. Now we're booked into the hotel in night and uh other people were also booked in. and my my I think Linda, she's uh motioning to me to come and uh this this young man would like to ask you a question. I said, "Oh my goodness. Uh I don't want to answer. I don't want to get engaged in any conversation." Well, they said he he'd like to talk to you. I said, "Okay." cuz he was sitting over at the table by himself. But his mother and father were there, but they were his father's a businessman and his father and mother sat right in front of sister Ruth and I the whole week. So I felt as though I knew him. And one day in fact is I felt like I wanted to lay my hands on the man and he was very very fine man. So, uh, I went over and this young man, 19, no, he's 23, I'm sorry, he's 23. And he says, uh, you made a statement in the service you spoke Tuesday night. Now, now, this is Sunday night. And he's he's been in about 14 meetings, and I spoke the second night. He says, "You made a statement on Tuesday night." And he said, "You said you you said a self-imposed sacrifice." He said, "What is that?" I knew that this was a unusual young man. And I said, 'Well, I said, 'It's something that maybe you want to do and God wants you to sacrifice it. He kind of put his head back and laughed. I said, "Am I coming home? Am I coming to the point?" And his mother was sitting beside him. And he said, she said, nodded, "Yeah, here's to the point." She said, he said, "I have a lot of options, a lot of opportunities." The reason why he has a lot of opportunities, I have his dad's card in my pocket here and his dad is authorized importer of BMW automobiles, Rover Land Rover automobiles for Nigeria. He's got a huge business and his dad is CEO and president of this company for Lagos for Nigeria. And I said obviously you have a lot of opportunities. Yeah. I said I do but I'd like to study this. I'd like to study and go in this direction. I said well maybe God wants you to sacrifice that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe that's why you asked this question. and he just put his head back and roared because I I I said I think I'm hitting the nail on the head. And he just put his head back and roared again. But I was impressed that somebody said, you know, they they've held that in their heart, &gt;&gt; just a few words for the whole week. &gt;&gt; What do you mean by that? Well, maybe I'm coming to your address. You you'll be hearing some things. You'll say, "What do you mean by that?" I want you to listen very very close because you will know a lot clearer towards the end of the end of the service. And so uh to be th this body that was prepared. The word prepared is this comes from about four associated words and it is to perfect or to complete one make one what they ought to be a body. Now I want you to think of yourself. A body has the Lord God prepared for me. He wants to anything that God will bring to you, he wants to make you what you ought to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's number one. &gt;&gt; Number two, having special attributes or special aptitude for given uses. In other words, you have been given a purpose in life &gt;&gt; and God gives you divine and specific aptitude for that purpose. &gt;&gt; That is part of the preparation. &gt;&gt; If you go back Moses or the prophets or whatever more, brother Brandham talks about them being rugged men. And they had an aptitude to be that &gt;&gt; because the message they were had to bring had to had to be delivered that way. &gt;&gt; And so they were a certain way. Now all of you that are here this morning, you've all had a different background and a different upbringing. And maybe you have had you have good reason to complain about that. But on the other hand, and those of you that have perhaps immigrated from other countries and some have had very uh difficult backgrounds, is that not so? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't want to hear about mine, but I was shifted all over the country. in fact is I've just said and I'm not going to dwell on it at all, but I've just said because of my own family and children and so on and and and some of my family were talking about where we're getting the rooms fixed for, you know, the girls or something or getting for the family for the children and I thought uh I tried to remember when I had a room. I have never in my youth and my teens never had a room of my own. Never had a room. And so then I thought about that and just had a a a sense of remorse for just a moment. And I thought, no, that was all part of the preparation because when I started going overseas and mission work, they'd say, "Well, this is where you're going to stay." And sometime they'd apologize and say, "Well, I'm sorry. we don't have anything else. You know, I that's just fine. In fact, there's one place in India they they had just like one piece of cloth on a on a bunch of boards and they said uh and he was very apologetic. He said I I I wish we had something more, but he said, "I only have this piece of cloth and you can either sleep on top of it or sleep under it were his exact words." And I said, "No, it'll be fine. I'll I'll figure out." And uh Jeff Jenkins was in another place and he had a little pad and I saw him as I walked by I'd see they were in another he and his dad were in another room. They had a little pad. He had a little pad and one day I just thought he's not preaching. I just took a hold of that pad and said I'm going to use this. [Laughter] Is it all right? So, we don't know what you know something you might be in the middle of and uh complaining and grumbling about it. It may be just that it's the work of God in your life preparing you to to be preparing the body for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I had a real good friend uh a native Indian man down from California and and he he knew all about how trees should be pruned and everything every and he was asked to pick apples in this orchard. And so he was picking apples and the man had not looked after it. He said he told me he said the man didn't even deserve to have an orchard. branches going everywhere. And he said, "I was complaining all afternoon. I was picking these apples. Had this big sack and he said, I was picking these apples. I was right at the top of the ladder." And he said, "And there was one big beautiful apple and I just need to reach and get that apple." And he said, "And I I reached out for that apple." And he says, "And the the ladder kicked out and I fell." He said, "It was the branches that I complained about all day that saved me." &gt;&gt; What a lesson. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the very thing that we're complaining about is the thing that God is, you know, is preparing our body, preparing this life for whatever he has in store for us. &gt;&gt; And so that is giving special aptitude for certain given uses. And then listen, this is a big one and it blessed me very much. I'm just in the very opening statements of my message, but it it is it comes from in preparation. You came into this world at a certain time. &gt;&gt; You were born at a certain time. You were at a certain age at this time. But God in his mind, he's sending his word saying knowing what he's going to reveal and knowing that certain people have to be there. And so the word is now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's now, this moment &gt;&gt; precisely for this time. God is not wasting his effort and sending his spirit and revealing things that are in the word of God. And this word of God certainly needs to be revealed. &gt;&gt; And he's not he's not doing that idly. It is for certain people and I come back to election elected for that time given certain aptitude, certain skills, certain abilities and certain passion within them. And that's what I picked up out of brother John Andy's on on Wednesday night. He thought it was a short message. Perhaps he didn't have the time, but it was just it was just absolutely precise &gt;&gt; because he conveyed his passion. &gt;&gt; And brother Ron Spencer, while we're away, he up in Edmonton, he said, "I like people with passion." He said, "That's why I like brother I like brother Tom Ray's preaching." He said, "Because he's passionate. He takes a hold of a scripture. He takes a hold of a statement." He said in a few moments he's just screaming that out. He said I love that. He said it tells me that a person is passionate. You don't want somebody just dribbling along with you know I have a testimony. Oh for go and tell the fox. &gt;&gt; Jesus said &gt;&gt; you want to be passionate. &gt;&gt; I'm saved. &gt;&gt; I'm redeemed. &gt;&gt; I'm full of the Holy Ghost. Thank you young people for singing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I I feel like shouting hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A person can't be passionate. Then you got the wrong religion. &gt;&gt; I'm passionate about this message. &gt;&gt; Other people need to hear it. &gt;&gt; If it's in not in their language, we need to get it in their language. We need to find them and hunt them out because we're looking for the last seed. And somebody is the last seed. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You better start praying or I'm not going to get done. &gt;&gt; And the last word that comprises he's a prepared a body is to take it up, to elevate it, and to carry it away. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what happened with the body of Jesus Christ. He was lifted up above the people and he was carried away &gt;&gt; and a cloud received him and the people were gazing said he'll come in like manner. Ah I just say praise be to God and he has sent a message to put you into heavenly places so that you are your mind you might say well I I I don't want to be so heavenly minded I'm no earthly good. That's exactly what I want. &gt;&gt; That you'll get so heavenly minded that this world and this Satan's Eden doesn't mean anything to you. I'm not living for this world. I'm not interested in this world. We're not interested in the finance or or the politics or all of these things because it's not going to get better, friends. &gt;&gt; Not going to get better. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so you might say, "I have a lot of problem. I have a lot of problem with my education. I have a lot of problem with the finance. I have a lot of problem." Well, that's good. &gt;&gt; Our heavenly father's not sitting there. Well, I didn't know that. &gt;&gt; He's not being taken by surprise. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's much. You've probably heard me say this, but there's much in the volume of the book. &gt;&gt; Lo, I come not just in the book, but I come in the volume of the book. All of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The good part, &gt;&gt; the bad part, &gt;&gt; the easy part, &gt;&gt; the difficult part. &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't like to hear that, but I'm going to tell you the difficult part. When they when they ate the Passover lamb, they said to eat all of it &gt;&gt; and the bad part, the difficult part, &gt;&gt; you know, it's it's one thing to say we will have difficult parts. There's difficult parts in the book. There's things that take place or things that we are required to go through and we don't like. But I'll say this that whatever God wants us to forget, you won't remember it anymore. &gt;&gt; Well, there's a few that believe that &gt;&gt; throughout the Old Testament, God built his masterpiece expressly for the sacrifice of sin. The full and complete penalty was paid when Jesus hung his head and said, "It is finished." that I I want you to try to grasp this this morning. Something I've been pondering. It is finished. &gt;&gt; Anything that Lucifer attempted to do &gt;&gt; has been resolved. any person he's determined to destroy &gt;&gt; of the elected of God, &gt;&gt; his his plan will not be deterred &gt;&gt; and it will not be afflicted. &gt;&gt; Now the scripture says and Jesus spoke it. I have it later on. He said if we come to it he said in this in the world you will have tribulation &gt;&gt; but be of good courage. &gt;&gt; I have overcome the world. &gt;&gt; Be at peace &gt;&gt; in the world. &gt;&gt; You shall have tribulation. That's not pleasant. That's not easy. I don't want to major on that. But I this message did not come to give us a bunch of uh weaklings &gt;&gt; or you know true &gt;&gt; people that are just unable to handle it and just kind of wimp and you know what I mean that's not what the message came to produce at all. &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach it straight going to preach it hard. &gt;&gt; The message actually came to preach to bring forth real solid people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you young ladies that are, you know, maybe concerned about your life and your future and how you look and who you're going to marry and all the rest of it, I say set your sights on eternal things on God and let him bring back whoever he wishes. &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of you people don't believe that, but I say that's absolutely the truth. Absolutely the truth &gt;&gt; because I find that when people take things into their own hands, they mess it up. &gt;&gt; And then when they mess it up, they want a preacher to resolve everything. I say, "You need to fix it yourself." &gt;&gt; I said to brother Dioa, "How do you how do you counsel all these people? I'm so involved in counseling." And he I said, "You've got 10 12,000 people in your church. How do you counsel these people?" He said, "I just tell them to go home and pray." &gt;&gt; Thought, boy, that is good. &gt;&gt; That's a good solution. Go home and pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is a book? Well, a book is you could look up on if you want to. It's just made up of p of pages and chapters. It could be blank pages. It might be printed pages. And uh sometimes the chapter might refer to as I said a moment ago a season of our lives. Uh your life becomes visible in a written book. Now this is what God said. Are you still listening? And Moses gathered all the congregation because God told him to, of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, "These are the words which the Lord hath commanded that thou do them." Why was that? Well, because if they didn't do them, none of the other people, none of the other nations would know what God commanded. &gt;&gt; So God commanded it and the people did it. And then the people who didn't know anything about this God say, "Oh, that's what it was." &gt;&gt; God sends a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I guess I'll have to say this is as clear as possible. He sends a message. And I noticed that in the Old Testament, God would call and speak through his prophets and tell them what was going to be. and come against the things that they were doing that was going to bring the judgment on down. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So they'd come crying against the way the people were. Sometimes they were burning incense to other gods and God doesn't do anything. They're burning incense to other gods. They're worshiping other gods and God doesn't do anything. But he had already given them a word. And Arie had prophets that were screaming out against what the people were doing. And that's why they were that's why they killed the prophets. They killed them because they didn't like them. They weren't popular. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said when he was there because he was speaking about things that was going to happen if you don't change. If you don't do something about this, it's not going to go well with you. And he would tell he would tell Israel, "If you don't, I'll you know you'll go into bondage." And so he had these people there. And they were not popular. &gt;&gt; They were not popular. &gt;&gt; And I want to say to this congregation, if you're sitting here waiting till the message gets popular, you're missing the boat. &gt;&gt; You might as well say, "Amen." This message did not come to become popular. &gt;&gt; And if it becomes popular, it's not the message. &gt;&gt; I had a woman, she was the reporter from the ecumenical newspaper, and I guess you know what that is. And it's a widpread newspaper throughout the area. and she said, "I'd like to uh I'd like to interview you." I said, "Okay." So, she came by and we sat down. I said, "Well, now I will uh if if you report any of this, if you print any of this in your paper, you need to print it in its entirety. I don't want you to pick and choose just and slant certain words. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, one of her questions was, and I hadn't had intended to say this, but I will. Uh, do you, and she was having difficulty. She was trying to be very diplomatic, and she said, "Do you ever think or consider that this might be a cult?" I said, "Oh, yeah. I I think of it." said, "Well, do you know what a cult is?" I said, 'Well, I I've read a little bit about it, but not much because I I don't have time for reading a bunch of other people's books. And she said, "Okay." I said, "But I said, "Do you know what a cult is?" I said, "What I have read about it is that a cult usually has a man as the head of it." said, "That's exactly right." And I said, "A cult usually considers that that man's words are to be kept. That's the absolute like an absolute." She said, "That's right." I said, "And a cult usually winds up being very few." She said, "That's right. That's right." And she was surprised that I could even give her some right answers. I said, "It sounds very much like Jesus and his disciples." &gt;&gt; And she was stunned. &gt;&gt; She didn't know what to say. She said, and her eyes went wide. She says, "You're right." &gt;&gt; And if I said it had been any other way, it wouldn't have been Jesus. &gt;&gt; I said it happened the same. It was the same with the disciples and it was the same with the all the messengers. It was the same with Luther. I said Luther was hunted hunted down all over Europe. &gt;&gt; I said and Wesley would stand on a chair or something and preach to a few thousand and they would even try to get a certain bank that would uh reverberate his voice so he could speak to all those thousands. And I said, "And a woman, a very, very powerful woman, stood up in the government of England and wanted the government to ban him from every pulpit in the entire nation, including his own father-in-law or his grandfather's pulpit." I said, "Was he popular?" "No." I said, "Yes." And if you mean that kind of a cult, I guess we are. &gt;&gt; And you know what she wanted to? She wanted me to baptize her, but she never came back. &gt;&gt; I would have baptized her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Do I have I' I've got to have a little more time. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so James and James said, "Be ye doers &gt;&gt; of the word &gt;&gt; and not hearers only." So we're not going to say, "I'm a I'm a message believer." Well, that's just words. &gt;&gt; I I want to say something that is acting it out, &gt;&gt; doing it, then I want to say it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham says, "I want to read some scripture, and it's just one verse, and I want to I want I want you to read it with me." And it's Deuteronomy 4:1 and to this church, he said, "And to the tapes and people on tapes and people on the hookup across other parts of the nation, I want you to listen to this real close. And don't you fail. This is the thing that Deuteronomy 4 chapter I I'm going to get the first verse and I want to read the first verse. Here's the verse. Now therefore, hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and to the judgments which I teach you, for to do them, &gt;&gt; that you may live &gt;&gt; and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm going slowly with that because to to receive the benefit it was that you take these statutes and these judgments and these things that God was and do them. &gt;&gt; And you know here we have a messenger all down this time. I'm going to be very very honest with you and very open. I'm I'm amazed at uh the number of people and you young people, you want to get a hold of the message and you want to ponder it and you want to just I will just tell you this as your friend, as your brother, as a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ, you need to know what it says &gt;&gt; and you need to do it not as a law, not as a bunch of dos and don'ts, &gt;&gt; but when the Bible talks about uh the kind of life you live, &gt;&gt; I I know a lot of people that dress right, but we have to do right. &gt;&gt; It's not just dressing right. &gt;&gt; It's not just acting right. It's doing the things. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for this congregation. I'm thankful you love the word of God. &gt;&gt; I know you've had all kinds of reversals and you've had all kinds of things and that's what I'm dealing with right today. &gt;&gt; All kinds of things that have taken place in every person's life and there are bitter pills to swallow. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you the cross of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; has literally obliterated, if I could get another word, annihilated. &gt;&gt; Amen. and taken the things that Satan has brought upon your life, your past, your direction, even to the death of people. &gt;&gt; Many of us have had someone that has passed away and we don't know about it. We prayed for them and and it didn't happen. They weren't healed. And yet, we have wonderful things that have taken place. Uh just recently the other night when I was in Germany, there was a pastor there. He's from uh West Africa and and uh he was of a certain influence and they were praying praying had a big prayer line and probably three 400 people in the prayer line. They're praying for the people. Brother Ron Spencer gave testimony and he said I and I I would sooner have him here saying this but he said I do have visions and he said uh sometimes I have vision. Brother Tim Puit's daughter whose name is Bethany who has been up here. Some of you know may know of and I see sister Kathy you know about this and she had a baby and the baby had an affliction in the legs and couldn't walk and uh brother Ron Spencer said to her he said I've had a vision that that that child will walk. I saw it running. And then Sister Puit became afflicted just weeks ago and she was a had an affliction and God was touching her and things were going in a positive direction and uh but she got discouraged. Are you here? &gt;&gt; Things go bad for a while then things go good &gt;&gt; and things go bad and she got discouraged. things were going absolutely sideways with her. And she had that child with her, I guess, on her lap. And that child, which had never walked and jumped off her lap and ran across the room and has been running ever since. and and this this little brother who was standing here at the after the service and listened to one testimony after another after another after another. Listen friends, it's not a bunch of words on a book. This is something that people become uh they become uh not only illuminated but their faith faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God not by the denominational doctrine by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Not by what someone's opinion is but by the word of God. And when the word of God and you hear it in its purity and there's something inside rises up says I believe that I believe that &gt;&gt; all things are possible to them that believe. Thus sayith the word of God. &gt;&gt; And that child leaped off that and this brother was at the back and he was there's several hundreds of people there and he just standing there a very fine pastor and he's he just saying I don't know him well. He was just saying, he wasn't saying it to me. He was just saying it to himself or saying it to anybody. There was nobody around, but he was just saying amazing. Absolutely amazing. Standing like this, amazing. And about several hundred people had just gone through the prayer line. He said, "Amazing." And I leaned over to him and put my mouth right to his ear and I said, "It's called the book of Acts." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what it is, friends. &gt;&gt; You can doubt it all you want to doubt it and it it'll pass you by &gt;&gt; and and all kinds of churches can say, "Well, we believe the message, etc., and just be influenced by the world and go by the world and dress like the world and talk like the world and be consumed by the world and have the have the whole mentality of the world and their whole educational system and the whole financial system and the and the Bible says this the Bible says that that we're not ignorant of Satan's devices &gt;&gt; and Satan will goes about as a roaring lion seeking whom whom he may devour. &gt;&gt; And devour is to swallow up. &gt;&gt; He wants to swallow up your attention. He wants to swallow up your effectiveness. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to you. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to you young ladies. I'm preaching to you young men because you're young and you're strong and you have some future. And I say get energized &gt;&gt; with the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Let what God said inspire you. not up today. Oh, I'm everything's just wonderful today. Why is it wonderful? Cuz things are going good and I got a job and I got a raise and I got &gt;&gt; Don't let that inspire you. That might all be gone tomorrow. &gt;&gt; But say everything's going fine because I just heard a messenger say that everything's in place. &gt;&gt; Everything's just fine with the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Where's the clicker? I I need a clicker for the Oh, thanks. I want you to read a few uh a few quotes with me. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? I'm not going to I'm not going to blaze through any as much as I would like to. Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, can I have the lights dimmed, please? Thank you. Sacrifice and offering, thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared me? I just want to stop there once again. What kind of a body? Is this a body just to appease the enemy? Is this a body just to help us through this life? No. It's a body that would bring such a victory. &gt;&gt; And if we can see that victory and participate in that victory, &gt;&gt; that's what &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't like to use personal examples but sometimes you hear so much &gt;&gt; so much and you hear people's burdens &gt;&gt; and you have to come to a place where you finally say well you know that's what it is it is what it is &gt;&gt; just hang on I'll get to it in a moment and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin now hast had no pleasure. Then said, "Lo, I come in the volume of the book. It is written of me to do thy will, oh God, and I will say to you, he did it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But to the elected, and I only have this, I won't probably read it all, but to the elected. God is calling to the elected. They know it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Calling the virtuous bride, the word, the last day church, the elected lady of our Lord Jesus Christ. Word. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the word. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; All right. Then the bride is always part of the bridegroom. So the bride will not be a denomination. It'll why why does he say denomination? Because they have their own se they have their own book. They have their own solution of words. We hold up message books here uh frequently all all the rest of it. That's fine. But the message book would absolutely agree with this Bible. &gt;&gt; We hold this as our absolute. &gt;&gt; I don't make I don't differentiate the the the message came to reveal Jesus Christ and he is the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And came to reveal him in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may have a question on that. &gt;&gt; Never loses his pattern. He always did it by the pattern. He done it every time by the pattern. He does it again. Calling out his virtuous bride in the last day. The lovely Rebecca waiting for her Isaac. He said, "Uh, what a beautiful time." Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, here it brings, now this is where I want you to your full attention. Here it brings into view the two books that's going to be mysterious to you when you read the book of the seven church ages. The two books, the book of life said, one says you can put your name on you never you never comes off. Other one says you take his name out of the book of life. This brings it perfectly into view right here in the invisible union of the bride of Jesus Christ. So that you know and here is very special. I have it. So I'd like everyone's attention. I wrote this big so you can see it on the balcony. Life is a sacred thing to God and it's recorded in a book. &gt;&gt; God is the author of life. Every book has to have an author. &gt;&gt; God is the author of the book of life. &gt;&gt; And do you believe that &gt;&gt; our natural life here that we have, everybody has it. &gt;&gt; We're all natural persons, individual persons. Our natural life here we have is just a perversion. It really should be the right life to begin with. But it's perverted by the natural birth. Did anyone come here outside the natural birth? I think we all came by natural birth. &gt;&gt; That's the problem. That's right. &gt;&gt; You just wait. Now the first life or your first union you were joined in at birth by nature. A natural act. A natural human being being associated man and woman together associated together in sexual affair which brought your first life here. And that's associated with sin and death. &gt;&gt; Now it was nature associated with death. Your first husband that had rule over you was your nature by natural birth. &gt;&gt; Have you followed thus far? &gt;&gt; Natural. You love the world. &gt;&gt; Some of you might be right here. Love the world because you are the world and part of the world. That right? Your desires was by nature to love the world which you're a part of. You're a part of nature. You believe that and that's your natural thing. &gt;&gt; That's the reason you have to be born again. &gt;&gt; You have to separate. &gt;&gt; You have to die to that first husband. You can't. And notice he said husband. There's another scripture &gt;&gt; here. Listen real close now. I don't have I have so much in my heart, in my mind that I want to give to you. But Jesus uh the word of God speaks in in Romans says, "Know ye not that she that is married to her husband, something like that, is is united or married until he dies." And then further on in the scripture, it says it speaks of Christ picking the death and Christ died to free us from that natural husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; You could not be free outside of a death &gt;&gt; and you were united by your natural birth. Now I want to say to everyone here, there isn't one person here, not one person who planned their own natural birth. &gt;&gt; Your mother and father when you were conceived in the womb of your mother. They perhaps didn't even know anything about you. Maybe mother didn't even know you were conceived. But God knew there was a life coming. &gt;&gt; And God knew whether he was going to talk to that life. God knew before the foundation of the world if that was an elected life. And I would just say friends, if you were elected, you might as well give up. &gt;&gt; God is not going to lose you. &gt;&gt; God is not going to let you make another choice. &gt;&gt; You'll say, "What will he do?" He'll just squeeze it and squeeze it. Yes, you'll make it. Say, "Well, is God arbitrarily going to say one go to heaven, one go to hell?" Nonsense. &gt;&gt; That's just the world. That's just a mind of man trying to argue about the things of God. God doesn't say, "I'm going to save one. I'm going to cast one to hell." That's not what God does. God by fornowledge. He knew who would receive him and who would not receive him. And that's what this Bible says. Whom he forneew them he predestinated. &gt;&gt; But man in his wisdom, he doesn't want predestination. He wants to think, "I want to make my own choice." Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; I'd like to see the man. I'd like to meet the man or the woman that make their own choice and make their own life happy and all the rest of it. That's nonsense. &gt;&gt; I even had a I had a close friend of mine, a business associate, and he said he said, "All I want to be is happy. I just want I tell you what, his life was anything but happy. The best thing you can do, the only thing you can do is commit your ways &gt;&gt; unto the Lord and he'll direct your path. He'll direct your footsteps. I don't care who you are. I don't care what country you're from. I can preach this to the world. This is the only solution. You're either elected of God or you're not elected. And this is a and and the fact he brings the gospel to you is his elected love. &gt;&gt; He loves you. He loves you. And it's elective love. [Music] &gt;&gt; You can't just say, uh, well, I'll divorce him. I'll hang him up here. In other words, what the prophet is saying, you you can't just take your nature and say, well, I'll just separate from it. I'll just do it on my own. You can't do that. &gt;&gt; He He He dies. The nature of the world has to die. Every spect of him has to die. You have to be reunited again with another nature. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is what the message came to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This isn't just some simple little Sunday school class. It is absolutely simple but yet it is it it is it has to be believed in its simplicity. You have to believe it. &gt;&gt; You can't just shove it off to the side. You you just have to believe it. &gt;&gt; It's all I can say. Now the Bible says in in I think it's Romans the 7th chapter says that a woman that's married to a man is married him to him as long as he liveth etc. Then it says that Christ died. And perhaps I should just read it. If you want to follow along, it's Romans 7. Know you not, brethren, for I speak to them that know the law. Now, as we're reading the first verses, don't get sidetracked into into what your mind thinks Paul is saying. Know ye not, brethren, for I speak to them that know the law, how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth. For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law of her husband as long as he liveth. Uh but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. I want you to think of the husband of your first nature. that you you receive that nature by your natural birth. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said that was your husband. &gt;&gt; You're united to him. And Paul, the same. Paul is saying the only way that you can be free from that husband is if the husband die. Now, we think of Calvary. We think of Calvary and the the nails and Jesus hanging there and all these things. The Calvary was much more than that. Jesus in the act of Calvary took every person here, took every sin, every iniquity and furthermore took the took the responsibility of your union with sin. &gt;&gt; He became that husband &gt;&gt; because he took the sins of the world. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? You following me? &gt;&gt; All right. He he became that husband &gt;&gt; because you were you were united. It took a message to tell you that &gt;&gt; that that was your first husband. &gt;&gt; And saying that you're united till that husband dies, &gt;&gt; then you're free. &gt;&gt; Have you followed that close? &gt;&gt; All right. Now, just listen. This is what it says. Wherefore, my brethren, ye also, you also become dead to the law, which was all of our works, by the body of Christ, that you should be married to another. &gt;&gt; That you should you should be married to another. You can't be married to another till you're free from the one. You said, "Well, I was born this way. I was born with these f I was born with this &gt;&gt; appetites and these desires. &gt;&gt; You know, Satan doesn't want me to announce this to you. &gt;&gt; The purpose of Jesus Christ came is to break that union. [Music] &gt;&gt; And Satan doesn't want you to understand that. He doesn't want he'd soon have our mind become lethargic. And that's not the plan of God. I've been wrestling over this message for a long time and determine that I'm going to stay with it and going to preach it if it takes all afternoon till you know that God uh you we we all in the human because of our human natural ability, our natural desires. And the prophet was asked a question. He was asked a question. Just want your attention. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He was asked a question. There's 10. Uh, just give me a moment here. Where's that scripture? It says what I would do when I would do good. I &gt;&gt; chapter seven &gt;&gt; seven. &gt;&gt; Maybe that's why I couldn't find it. I thought it was elsewhere. &gt;&gt; Yes. Okay. Says, "Wherefore, my brethren, you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ, that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead." So that doesn't that that's not just Jesus who walked by the shores of Galilee. This is the Jesus that died and rose again &gt;&gt; and those who walked with him didn't know him at the moment and rose from the dead that we should be bring forth fruit unto God. &gt;&gt; These aren't idle words, friends. This is what God has said in his word. And you were in church Sunday morning that we might bring forth fruit. You are the fruit of your mother's womb. God sends his word to us so that we bring forth fruit. In other words, we don't just say we're message believers or that we believe on Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; but we look and act and are like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I'm not saying I possess it all. I'm I'm preaching it anyway. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching it because this is God's word. &gt;&gt; And I preach it not because I have a history of acting like a superhuman person. No. In fact is we're super weak. But we have to declare it anyway. &gt;&gt; It's the word of God. It's the only way to confess it. &gt;&gt; Amen. For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we are delivered. I say now we are delivered. Let all the delivered of the Lord say so. &gt;&gt; From the law uh that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness oldness of the letter. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, uh, no, no, it's not. It's not seven, brothers. If you could just help me a moment. He says, "When I would do good, evil is present with me. The things which I &gt;&gt; 78." &gt;&gt; Pardon? &gt;&gt; 7 verse 18. &gt;&gt; 7 verse 18. Okay. All right. Now, a man asked uh brother Brennham this question. He said, "I have a question." That was in questions and answers of 1964. I want to start with verse 14 of of seven. &gt;&gt; For we know that the law is spiritual, &gt;&gt; but I am carnal, &gt;&gt; sold under sin, &gt;&gt; for for that which I do I allow not. But what I would that do I not. &gt;&gt; But what I hate, that do I. and then I do that which I would not. I consent unto the law that it is good. But now it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. And the man said, I don't understand this. And by your quietness, you say the same thing. I don't understand this. That's why I want your full attention. says, "For I know that in me that is in my flesh, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; that came by this natural birth, &gt;&gt; dwelleth no good thing, &gt;&gt; for to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says this, he says after he read the scripture, he said, "Well, they wrote out the scripture." That's Paul's speaking to the Romans. Let me just kind of polish it up so you can see. &gt;&gt; He said, "So now I know that this is difficult. I've been wrestling with it." He says, "In me is two persons. &gt;&gt; Right, one wants me to do right, one wants me to do right, and wrong, the other wants me to do." And every time I start doing right, the wrong hinders me. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; This is down where you live. &gt;&gt; I'm not up in the pie in the sky. &gt;&gt; I'm down where you live. &gt;&gt; God happens to know exactly what your what you live. &gt;&gt; And the other wants me to do wrong. And every time I try to do right, wrong hinders me. He said, "How many of you people on the interview this afternoon?" Now he's talking about his own interviews that he had this afternoon. That afternoon, he said interviews this afternoon has run the same thing in this morning. Same same thing, spoke on it this morning temporarily. He said you are an outward man which is controlled by six senses. Other places he had said five senses but the six sense is faith. He says you are an outward man which is controlled by six senses. You are an inward man controlled by one sense which is faith. &gt;&gt; And this faith disagrees and this faith disagrees with all six senses. or let's just say, well, it's five senses. But faith disagrees with the senses of this body because the scripture says and teaches us and the message teaches us that these senses are given to us to contact this earthly life. &gt;&gt; And so we feel &gt;&gt; and we have also in our in the spirit realm, we have our emotions. And your emotions, friends, don't lead you to truth. &gt;&gt; It's not your emotions. Your emotions makes you, oh, I feel real, you know, righteous or I feel holy. I feel good. It has nothing to do. You might come into this church feeling rotten. And that's the very time God wants to speak to you. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? And you are an outward man which is controlled by six senses. You're an inward man controlled by one sense which is faith. And this faith disagrees with all six senses in this and the six senses doesn't agree with faith. Uh if the six senses doesn't agree with faith but one is contrary to the other. Now as long as the six senses agree with the faith, wonderful. But when the six senses disagree with faith, then leave the six senses alone. &gt;&gt; We are carnal. &gt;&gt; We are carnal and that part must perish. &gt;&gt; But then inside we are a spirit man, &gt;&gt; a soul inside. And that's faith in God's word. When we bring our outward body under subjection to the word of by faith by accepting what God said. &gt;&gt; By accepting by what God said. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; Just one paragraph. How can I take a cucklebar a cuckle burr and make and here's the key. How can I take a cuckle burr and make a grain of wheat out of it? It's impossible &gt;&gt; for me to do it. The only way it can be is because inside that cockleber has been transmitted &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; from a cockleber wheat uh a cockleber to a a germ called wheat life. &gt;&gt; Now just listen close because this is ultra simple and yet it gets real deep and it's something you have to believe. If you're going to come to a deliverance and a victory, he says, "Then you bury the cuckleber and it'll produce a grain of wheat." That's if there there's been transmitted. You might say, "Well, scientifically, how does that work?" We're not talking about science now. We're talking about what God &gt;&gt; the creator &gt;&gt; has done. And he has a servant putting it in such simple language that you are obliged to believe it or disbelieve it. &gt;&gt; And this is what you believe. Then you bury the cocklebar and it'll produce a grain of wheat because there has been a life of wheat put in the cocklebar &gt;&gt; and the life of the cockleber has been taken out. Come on. &gt;&gt; But the nature of the cockleber is still sticky. &gt;&gt; And it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again. &gt;&gt; Brother Brand, one place calls it the acid of death or in the process of death. And when it comes forth, then it's no more cuckleber but wheat. Right. &gt;&gt; He says, "But while it's here on earth, out of the earth and a cuckleber, and we are out of the earth, &gt;&gt; we all are out of the earth. And we have certain frailties and certain things, and I I don't want to get to specifics, otherwise it just gets quieter and quieter." But we all have a sticky part. &gt;&gt; And in the body of Christ, this is what I'm really preaching on. I would have come to this. In the body of Christ, this is where we have problems being a united body because we all run into each other's sticky part. says, "Well, you know, I don't really, you know, I don't think I I don't see that way. I don't like, you know, I don't perhaps care for them, so I better carry on." and a cuckleber. And a cuckleber, it's still sticky, but it's got the nature on the inside of it of wheat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is where sticky people who realize it ought to be shouting hallelujah. We got a sticky nature, but inside of it &gt;&gt; speaks a prophet of God is a wheat life. &gt;&gt; And as long as you're in this life, you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live. But the inside of you, &gt;&gt; you're born again. And when you're raised up, &gt;&gt; you're in the likeness of Christ &gt;&gt; and all the sin, all the sin is gone from you. &gt;&gt; That's part of the preparation. &gt;&gt; And the thing is, if if we can just simply accept that, &gt;&gt; okay, that's a sticky part. &gt;&gt; I got that sticky part from a natural birth. Yeah, &gt;&gt; someone might be this say, "Well, I'm Irish or I'm Ukrainian or I'm German or I'm something else." And we don't want to be making excuses for things. And this this is not to make excuses, but it is to see it clearly and say, "Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; I see that. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I Well, today it's a little rough. I'm just dealing with a sticky part. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes when you the sticky part comes up, you just say, "Excuse me a second. I got to count to 10." [Laughter] &gt;&gt; No, you folks don't have that problem. &gt;&gt; That happens to be the truth. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you believe it or not. That's the truth &gt;&gt; and that's the way it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; And people can become so uh mature and so holy and so devout and so righteous. But somewhere along the line, &gt;&gt; it comes up, &gt;&gt; it comes up. And when we talk about the union of the husband and the wife, I don't care how wonderful things are here at the altar. Somewhere along the line, the sticky part shows up &gt;&gt; somewhere along the line. And uh you know, I've counseledled people who've had marriage problems and then when they sit down in my office, they they just feel so embarrassed. They say, "Well, you know, it's not really worth talking about." That's exactly right. It's not not worth talking about. And and sometimes it's it's the simplest things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You think I'm making up these stories? Not a bit. &gt;&gt; One woman could not stand how her husband squeezed the half a grapefruit and slurped the or the slurp the grapefruit. Jo, I can't stand that. And that was their big problem. That was one of their problems. You say, "Is that is that and the other one?" and he couldn't stand the way she squeezed it toothpaste out of the toothpaste tube, rolled it, and got the last out of it. This will go around the world. But my my wife, she's so frugal, she cuts them open. See, she's back there waving like this, telling me I've gone far enough. But doesn't bother me. I just have to it it I I save some money when she squeezes the last out of the I mean it just isn't that funny. We're just we're born that way. &gt;&gt; We're born that way. Some are born so frugal and some were born so liberal and some were born however we're born. Blame somebody as long as we can blame somebody back there in the past. &gt;&gt; Well, I just inherited it. I asked my wife this morning. She didn't know exactly what I was going to preach on. I says, "It's really strange." I said, "You know, a doctor, that's an easy way out for a doctor to say, "Oh, you just inherited it." I said, "What does that mean?" &gt;&gt; That still doesn't diagnose the problem. &gt;&gt; I got I got a problem. He said, "Well, you inherited it." You don't believe it. I went to a doctor. I went to my doctor and I said, "I I've got this." He said, "Just thank your parents for it." I said, 'Well, I have another thing. I had three things I want to talk. I said, 'I'm too skinny. Can you believe I was too skinny? I was like, Michael. And he said, you'll live longer. What's the other one? And I had a I I had a third one. And he says he says, "You inherited that also." He said, "Just give the girl five bucks on the way out." And I was all done. That's when we had to pay $5. But in spite of that, in spite and did God know we were going to be sticky? &gt;&gt; He knew that. &gt;&gt; He knew that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I sit down. I've got to be careful here because I I run into personalities. And um &gt;&gt; should I preach? God knew every little sticky part of us. &gt;&gt; But nevertheless, that didn't hinder his election. Said, "You're elected anyway. &gt;&gt; I don't care how sticky you are. I don't care what kind of problem you have. I I elect some and those that I elect of my children, they're my children regardless." says, "Well, we could go to we could go to we could go to Matthew the 1st chapter and say, well, uh, Bath Sheba, I could I could give you some things. I've wrestled with this. Ba Sheba, she was married to Uriah. Uriah was a loyal man in in David's army. And David had committed adultery with Ba Sheba. You say, "Well, you know, now we start running out of space because we like things to be clean and holy and so on so forth." &gt;&gt; And and and and I'm not belittling being clean and holy. I'm not belittling that. Not for a moment. But I'm I I'm saying be sure you don't bel grace. &gt;&gt; Be sure you don't belittle election. &gt;&gt; If God elects something, &gt;&gt; that's that's what's important to him. I've elected them. I bless who I bless and I curse who I curse. That's exactly what God And when God blesses somebody, he'll bless their family. He'll bless all that's around them. He'll bless what they do. He'll bless when they lay down. He'll bless them in the night time. He'll do all kinds of things. And anyone who rises up comes against them, he won't all he won't tolerate it. &gt;&gt; He just won't let it happen. &gt;&gt; Why? And then people down here, all the sticky stuff comes up &gt;&gt; and says, "Well, you know, uh, they think they're somebody." No, it's not that. It's a God has shone his light upon them. &gt;&gt; They don't want to regard that. And I'll tell you something, friends. The world hates this message, &gt;&gt; but God happens to love it. And so people rise up against it and he doesn't allow it to prosper. &gt;&gt; And then they get, you know, more even more sticky and say, "Well, you think you're somebody." No, no, I really don't. Well, you think you're the bride. What's wrong with thinking you're the bride? What do you think you're somebody? &gt;&gt; You know, friends, &gt;&gt; I'm glad I can say at least at the age that I am to be able to share some of this with you. &gt;&gt; We've gone a long ways. &gt;&gt; We've come a long ways down the road. We've seen a lot of water go under the bridge. And so I can tell you that these are some things that I have experienced and we and and we we keep on uh we keep on asking and some of you won't maybe like what I'm preaching but you've got I'm not saying that you got to get rid of your sticky nature. Some preachers spend all their time trying to get people free of their sticky nature when a prophet says you'll have it till you die &gt;&gt; because you were born. We have to believe what the scripture says. And the scripture says we're married to that nature. &gt;&gt; That nature was our husband. &gt;&gt; But Jesus Christ, this is the glory of the cross. &gt;&gt; He went to the cross. &gt;&gt; He became sin for us. He died a death &gt;&gt; so that our husband died &gt;&gt; and we're married to another. That's a revealed and that's why the revelation of Jesus Christ is so important to us because we're not married. We're not married to who William Brandom was. We're married to the Jesus Christ that was revealed in the message God sent him. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, if you can see this, I'm gonna say a mouthful now. God has come and revealed Jesus Christ to you so you could see him and see who it was you're married to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And people who are looking for now I'm coming right down to the message. People are looking for or they're looking for brother Brandon to come back or they're looking for someone else to raise up or they need somebody or they need some hero. You don't have the message. &gt;&gt; The message is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you see him in his beauty and you see him in his redemptive power and you see him revealing himself today, you say, "That's my husband." &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Daniel. Now, shake my hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some might like it, &gt;&gt; some may not like it, but I'm saying it on behalf of my husband. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's someone that's revealed to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close now. I think I got the message across. &gt;&gt; Now I'm going to just close with this. This is the summon substance. I went over this. You know, sometimes I just have to preach it. I've never been able to preach it. to my wife. The way Brother Brandham said he he got his wife and he had to preach to her. I thought that must be wonderful. But I was so full the first time in my life right on this. I just laid in bed and I just started to preach cuz I wanted to see how my wife was going to how she would uh react to this. So I kind of use her as a temperature gauge to see how the congregation. Now we are on this side. &gt;&gt; Now we're on the New Testament side. We're not in the Old Testament. Say, "Well, he said, "A body hast thou prepared me?" &gt;&gt; Now the scripture says, the Bible says, "No, you're not. You're the body of Christ." Oh, we're the body of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Prepared body &gt;&gt; and we see ourselves uh that's why I said in Edmonton said brother Brandham said something and this bothered me and you're all listening. This is what he said. He said, "My ministry is a ministry to unite the body of Christ." &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Boy, oh boy, I've been preaching this message for a lot of years, and we're probably further from it. &gt;&gt; What would he think? What does God think? And why are we divided?" Well, somebody has an opinion or somebody thinks something else. And I was thinking this morning, Brother Tom, Brother John, Brother Tim, this church has been identified as being very legalistic. If those people happen to be listening today, they're going to think Brother Ed is dropped off the deep end. He's talking about people that were murderers and adulteresses and all kinds of things. I just want to tell you something. &gt;&gt; If there's anything that you can do to contribute to salvation, &gt;&gt; I'm going to just say mouthpiece in just a moment. If there's anything that you can do that can contribute to salvation, that's not the salvation that can save us. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And we read, hello. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the book of life, the lamb's book of life, &gt;&gt; that your name or now you see your life is in the lamb's book of life. And that's the only way that you are saved. Those whose names were in the book of life of the lamb before the foundation of the world Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want everyone with me. &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world, before the foundation of the world, you were a a wheat life, a seed &gt;&gt; in the mind of God &gt;&gt; where there is no sin. &gt;&gt; There can be no sin &gt;&gt; in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; No sin, &gt;&gt; no sinful nature in the mind of God. He sees I'm going to have this person come. Then the fall came and the sticky nature came and everyone was born by a sec natural sexual birth and we inherited uh sticky nature. &gt;&gt; This isn't making excuse. This happens to be the reality. It's the way it is. &gt;&gt; We got certain weaknesses, certain frailties, certain things. I'm not suggesting we can just be lustful and feed out that lustful desire. I'm not saying that. I'm saying you have the power within you to overcome that and let that thing die the death. &gt;&gt; But neither can you neither can you can neither can you put any sin into the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying it's that you can keep it out. I'm saying that God who provided this redemption that you have saw you sinless before he even wrote your name in the book. &gt;&gt; He knew you were going to fall. &gt;&gt; He knew you were going to come into this world. &gt;&gt; He knew you were going to come in as a sinner and a liar and a deceit and all the rest of it. He knew all of that. &gt;&gt; And I'm not even perhaps saying everything that happened. He knew all of that. &gt;&gt; He knew all about your young life and your youth. And &gt;&gt; he knew all about that. &gt;&gt; He knew all about the temptations. He knew all about the sticky nature. He knew all about the temper and and the maybe the hatred and the bitterness of Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He knew all about that before he wrote your name in the book. &gt;&gt; Before he wrote your name in the book. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I am electing them to have this place in my book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is a book. The pages of this book aren't 50/50. &gt;&gt; 50% righteous and 50% sinful. &gt;&gt; The book of life, the book, Lamb's book of life is absolutely sinless. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if you can see that, &gt;&gt; then you need to see the Old Testament saints. That's how come because the other side of the in the New Testament the other side of the cross you cannot find after the after the Christ came who was a full sacrifice for sin. &gt;&gt; Everything that Rahab was, she is pure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything Bath Sheba was, she's pure. Everything David was, he's without sin &gt;&gt; on this side because Calvary paid it all. &gt;&gt; And if you can see that and say, "Oh, that's all right." In the past, that's what's going on right now. [Applause] You look at yourself. &gt;&gt; You're not worthy of heaven. &gt;&gt; But you're worthy of heaven by God's word. &gt;&gt; That I have called you. &gt;&gt; I have redeemed you. &gt;&gt; Your sins I will remember no more. &gt;&gt; That's our God. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of religion I have. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of religion you have must have. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you're going to go to heaven, you must have a religion that that God says your sins I will remember no more. &gt;&gt; And I have written a book. It's called the lamb's book of life. Yeah. You had a book of life. And the brother Brandham says you might get confused and think there's two books. Actually the one comes into the other one because we were all born a natural birth came with a sticky nature but God in his abundant grace took care of it by predestination says I saw them before the sticky nature came. &gt;&gt; I saw them they were mine and I declared them as mine before Adam fell before Eve did what she did. I declared them to be. Listen, friends, here we are in 2016. I'm here to say that isn't when we started. We started in the mind of God. You folks started in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; And if you weren't there, you'll never be there. &gt;&gt; I say, I'm glad I'm in this place. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I have that that I can believe. &gt;&gt; And that's what I hang on to. &gt;&gt; I've been perfectly honest. I say I say to my wife, if it depends on us, we'll never make it. &gt;&gt; People may think we're so nice and we're just a nice old couple and we're so righteous and all the rest, but and I think we are. But on the other hand, if it if if we can contribute any goodness, I can never enter into heaven's gates. &gt;&gt; It's not our goodness. &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with our goodness. &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad my father saw not my earthly father but my heavenly father saw the sticky nature &gt;&gt; because we battle it all the time. &gt;&gt; You folks battle it. I happen to know you battle it. When you go out these doors, you battle it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And thoughts go through your mind. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful we have a blood &gt;&gt; stronger than our thoughts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have a blood that atoned for everything. not to allow me just to throw uh you know throw all um throw every what am I trying to say to throw all restraint to the wind. No, that's not that. We live godly in honor &gt;&gt; of our Lord Jesus Christ. We want to be a true witness of the true vine. But yet every thought and and the scripture tells us that all is written. God life is a sacred thing to God and it's all written in the book. Your deeds are written in a book. &gt;&gt; I want to come very very straight and I'm I just the last couple minutes here. &gt;&gt; There isn't one person here. I don't care how nice you are, how you're looked upon, how righteous you are, how good you live. Nobody here would want their thoughts. &gt;&gt; Amen. yesterday &gt;&gt; on that screen &gt;&gt; for all to see. &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus saw them &gt;&gt; when he stepped forward and said, "I'll take that book. &gt;&gt; I'll take that book. &gt;&gt; Our book with every deed, &gt;&gt; every thought, &gt;&gt; everything &gt;&gt; that you ever did was in that book." He says, "I'm not ashamed of it. They're mine." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have the atonement. I have the power. I have the blood to pay for it. &gt;&gt; And they'll come. They'll walk on the other side of here as spotless as can be. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is it all right? &gt;&gt; Is that all right, folks? &gt;&gt; That to me is grace. &gt;&gt; Grace. Grace. &gt;&gt; God's a grace. &gt;&gt; Musicians can come. &gt;&gt; I'm sure we have to sing. Redeemed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Nobody can stop it. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful, folks? Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you, Brother Joseph. &gt;&gt; See you. Say amen. I'll be here Wednesday night to say amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; We're having church, aren't we? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you don't know this Christ, this is where denominations feed. They just fade right off the map. What the denomination can deal with those things? Nobody. Nobody. No one. Let's stand as we sing. [Music] and forever [Music] to be my [Music] victori.

Just going to ask brother Tom Bray to dismiss us. Amen. Amen. May God give you a glorious [Music] revelation of his redemption in Jesus name. Brother Tom, would you please God? &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, this morning we have heard the word of life and we can truly say, do we know what it is not to have one guilty feeling? We have come through the blood of the lamb. Father, we're just so thankful that the realization of the revelation of the life of Christ has come in this hour, Lord, to redeem a people to wash her in the water of the word. That we can stand here tonight today, Lord, rejoicing knowing that the word of God has found an entrance within our lives. And we can rejoice that Jesus Christ has found us. It's not us finding God, but you found us, Lord. You planted us throughout the ages and you knew us would come down to this time at this junction and you've washed a people by the purity of the word of life and we can say holy is our God and worthy to be praised. Lord, we thank you for your servant. We thank you for the thought of God that has dropped down, Lord, this morning. That we can look at ourselves and know we've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Not by the works of man, not by our own hands, Lord, but by the grace of almighty God. Truly, this is amazing. as we've closed this service, singing it on our lips. Lord, that God should find a sinner such as I could change my sorrow into bliss. To know we have a future hope, to know it's things that are to be. To know we're moving from mortal to immortality. Bless your children, Lord, and strengthen Brother Ed this morning. We love him with a great love. We pray, Lord, that you'll pour in grace upon grace. Go with us, Lord. We ask in Jesus' name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Have you greeted one another? We'll do it again. You're dismissed in Jesus name. [Music] Oh, heat, heat. [Music] Hurricane. Heat. Heat. [Music] Jesus [Music] Christ [Music] and the righteousness of to give us. [Music] Amen. Almighty God [Music] as we pray that you'll touch him as this clarity we ask Jesus. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music]
