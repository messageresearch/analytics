[16:36] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our hope, our confidence
[16:43] is in you this morning.
[16:46] The only one worthy.
[16:49] the only one found worthy to come and
[16:51] take the book. But this morning, we
[16:54] believe that the redeemed have gathered.
[16:57] They have been found worthy and you have
[16:59] given them the book.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; We stand in awe of your awesome
[17:04] presence.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nothing in ourselves that we
[17:09] find, Lord Jesus, but to the cross we
[17:12] cling this morning. The great sacrifice
[17:16] lamb was slain.
[17:19] on our behalf this morning.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:30] I trust Calvary means more to you this
[17:33] morning.
[17:36] Amen. One look at Calvary with an honest
[17:41] heart.
[17:43] with an honest heart and everything
[17:46] pales in comparison.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; Your failings,
[17:52] your weaknesses
[17:55] with an honest heart, friends, your
[17:57] friends failings and their weaknesses
[18:00] pale in comparison to Calvary.
[18:05] My bones, they stare at me.
[18:10] His flesh was hanging off his back.
[18:15] Our weaknesses fail in comparison to
[18:19] Calvary.
[18:22] Our sicknesses
[18:24] hold no moral redeeming value in his
[18:27] presence.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; We can shake them off this morning.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. We appreciate each one of your
[18:36] lives this morning. trust that this
[18:38] resurrection morning will have a new
[18:41] meaning to us. Amen. Happy Father's Day
[18:45] to all of our fathers. God bless you on
[18:48] this resurrection morning.
[18:51] Amen. Amen. Amen. We want to remember
[18:53] our brother Tom this morning ministering
[18:55] with the saints down in Seattle at
[18:57] Brother Mockmoods. So, if we don't see
[18:59] some of the ones that have been driving
[19:01] up recently over the last several
[19:03] months, we trust that they just have a
[19:05] real blessed time as we have a real
[19:08] blessed time in the presence of the Lord
[19:10] this morning. It's good to have all the
[19:12] visitors with us. Switzerland, from
[19:15] Arizona. I've got a list of names.
[19:19] Brother John Peterson, Brother Matthew
[19:21] and Sister Kim Potter, Sister Emily
[19:24] Clayville,
[19:26] Brother Bill and Sister Mary Ivy,
[19:30] Brother Oed and his wife Dioa, Brother
[19:34] Gerard and Sister Angela Michel from
[19:36] Switzerland.
[19:39] Amen.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; They come from the east and the west,
[19:44] &gt;&gt; from the lands of far.
[19:46] &gt;&gt; So the scripture has been fulfilled yet
[19:48] again. this morning in our very midst
[19:50] and we wouldn't want to miss that
[19:53] opportunity. I'm just going to have
[19:54] brother John come and lead the
[19:57] congregation of people in prayer this
[19:59] morning. We do want to remember brother
[20:00] Hugh messages sister Sylvia's sister
[20:04] sick in need of a healing touch this
[20:08] morning
[20:09] and uh need from Helen Smith also with a
[20:14] many may know her as good from up in
[20:16] White Horse I believe just as a real
[20:19] unspoken request and ask that the Lord
[20:22] would intervene on her behalf.
[20:25] Amen. And if you have a need upon your
[20:26] heart this morning with an honest heart,
[20:29] just make it known by the uplifted hand
[20:30] to he who sees every need. Amen.
[20:40] I just wanted to give a quick testimony.
[20:42] We've just had a few hours with our
[20:44] brother Ivy in fellowship and he gave me
[20:47] a testimony of a family in his church
[20:50] that had three children. And I think
[20:52] they were three daughters raised in the
[20:54] message, but at a certain time they they
[20:59] just left the Lord. They went out into
[21:00] the world. And I believe it was this
[21:03] last Easter season, he was baptizing,
[21:05] Brother Ivy was baptizing another
[21:07] individual and one of those young ladies
[21:11] was at the service and she just came
[21:13] literally almost running to the altar.
[21:17] And I think it was the next week or a
[21:18] short time after that, she rededicated
[21:21] her life to the Lord and was baptized
[21:23] again. God is in the restoration
[21:26] business.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; All the years
[21:28] &gt;&gt; and just when you think like things are
[21:30] just shattering, falling apart, and you
[21:32] don't know what to do, Jesus Christ is
[21:35] able to bring it all back together
[21:37] again.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; He's a wonderful father.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; So, he's our healer today. He's the
[21:43] restorer. He's the deliverer. He's the
[21:45] He's the answer to all of our needs.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; So, the world might call it Father's
[21:50] Day, but we take this opportunity to
[21:52] say, "Our great Father."
[21:55] &gt;&gt; From where all of our answers and all of
[21:58] our whatever we have need of, just plug
[22:01] into him today.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we lift up our hands,
[22:05] God. We're surrounded around the altar
[22:07] of sacrifice.
[22:09] You, the lamb of God, are the sacrifice.
[22:13] The only one that was worthy that
[22:15] stepped forward and took the book,
[22:18] &gt;&gt; took our past, took our present. You
[22:21] knew our future. You even knew before we
[22:25] were born, the pathway of our lives. How
[22:28] many times we would forsake you, go
[22:31] away, fall. But you came to us, Lord.
[22:35] Your grace, Lord, made a way where there
[22:38] seems to be no way. Your healing came
[22:41] bursting through.
[22:43] Your deliverance set us free. This
[22:47] morning, we want to give praise. We lift
[22:49] up our hands. One hand, two hands. Most
[22:52] of all, our hearts, God. We want to give
[22:55] you glory. We want to give you praise.
[22:58] We want to open up our mouths and say,
[23:00] "Thank you, Jesus. Our Father, which art
[23:03] in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy
[23:06] kingdom has come. Your will is being
[23:09] done in this earth as it is in heaven.
[23:12] Consume us this morning. God,
[23:16] let your word be manifested, all over
[23:19] this building, all over the unseen, the
[23:22] internet, the phone hookup, and even
[23:24] beyond these walls. As prayers are
[23:27] coming up as odors, we're reminded of
[23:30] the testimony of our brother Ivy, how
[23:32] you can save souls and win hearts. God,
[23:36] we were all calloused. We were all
[23:38] broken. We were all a stranger from you.
[23:42] I'm I'm reminded of the father that was
[23:44] looking down the road and all of a
[23:46] sudden a son started coming down the
[23:49] road and he ran toward him. What a
[23:52] rejoicing God. What a day this is Lord
[23:55] that you can restore all things to our
[23:58] lives and we can cry aba father my
[24:02] father our father
[24:06] the same being that was present lord in
[24:08] the tabernacle years ago when you broke
[24:11] those seals is very very near today
[24:15] you attended your prophet in the
[24:17] meetings you was with the believers the
[24:19] martyrs those that gave their lives
[24:22] brothers and sisters ers, Lord, and we
[24:24] we put our lives up next to theirs as
[24:27] they without us are not made perfect.
[24:29] Would you perfect our lives today, God?
[24:32] There's needs all over. Our hands are
[24:34] lifted up. We are a needy people, but we
[24:38] serve a great God, and our faith is in
[24:41] you. We are resting our faith in your
[24:44] word, God, that nothing you have spoken
[24:47] will return to you void, but you will
[24:49] accomplish what you sent it out to do.
[24:52] accomplish it within these lives. God,
[24:55] let the supernatural just break out
[24:57] through the service as we are not in a
[24:59] form or just a ritual of a meeting. But
[25:02] Lord, we are looking to you to touch our
[25:05] souls,
[25:07] transform lives, move into areas of the
[25:11] unseen, people's lives and their
[25:13] spirits, God, into their bodies. Satan
[25:17] may try to hide, demons may try to hide,
[25:20] but the great doctors on the case today.
[25:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, we embrace your word.
[25:29] We whatever you say to us, Lord. Let
[25:32] your presence draw near to every life.
[25:35] We want to thank you, God. May you move
[25:38] into the room, Lord. there where the
[25:39] brothers and sisters in Tacoma, Seattle,
[25:43] Federal Way are gathering and may you
[25:44] pour out your spirit on that meeting.
[25:46] Lord, your will be done and may you just
[25:49] direct these lives. Lord,
[25:52] &gt;&gt; Sister Helen has a need, Lord, from
[25:54] White Horse. May you minister to her.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Every unspoken request, every heart,
[26:02] we're here this morning, Jesus, for a
[26:04] divine encounter with you. We want you
[26:07] to touch our lives in a way that no
[26:10] church, no man, no friend, no
[26:14] individual. We're wanting to go beyond
[26:16] all of that, Lord, into a place where
[26:19] it's God, you, and us alone. So we shut
[26:23] away everyone else, all of our feelings,
[26:26] all of our thoughts, all of our strong
[26:29] opinions, and let your word just come to
[26:33] its meeting place.
[26:36] We commit this service to you Lord in
[26:39] Jesus name.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:47] My hope
[26:51] is in the Lord
[26:55] from this time on
[26:59] and
[27:04] My
[27:16] [Music]
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. You may have
[27:21] your seats this morning.
[27:25] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[27:28] We've got a quick announcement we need
[27:30] to make. We're going to have a baby
[27:31] dedication this morning.
[27:34] Brother Toby and Sister Rebecca
[27:37] Caillumbi are going to have their little
[27:38] one dedicated. Our pastor is going to
[27:40] come this morning.
[27:42] Brother Toby and Sister Rebecca, if you
[27:44] could come.
[27:46] Brother Richard Drake wants to announce
[27:48] that next Sunday. Our Sunday school
[27:51] children will be singing in the
[27:53] sanctuary, presenting also their
[27:56] missionary offering.
[27:58] Please have the children here at the
[28:00] church at 9:45 sharp so they can get
[28:03] their practice done before the song
[28:06] service starts. That would be a real
[28:08] blessing if you could be here. Amen for
[28:11] that.
[28:13] Why don't we sing together? Jesus loves
[28:16] me, this I know. For the Bible tells me
[28:19] so.
[28:21] Jesus
[28:23] loves me this I know.
[28:28] For the Bible tells me so.
[28:34] Little ones. To him belong.
[28:40] They are weak but he is strong.
[28:45] Yes Jesus
[28:48] loves me.
[28:51] Yes,
[28:53] Jesus loves me.
[28:57] [Music]
[28:58] Jesus loves me.
[29:02] [Music]
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:12] This is a grand
[29:15] a grand occasion.
[29:18] brother Toby and sister Rebecca
[29:22] and uh
[29:24] her
[29:26] uh some of her parents are here. I mean
[29:28] her mother and family is here and her
[29:32] father I was actually just spent some
[29:33] time with him in Switzerland and brother
[29:36] Toby's parents are here and that is
[29:40] really wonderful.
[29:42] I'm going to ask uh
[29:46] brother
[29:48] Cailloui,
[29:49] if you would please come
[29:52] and join me.
[29:55] Brother Caillou is a senior pastor
[29:58] and uh I'm sure they dedicate children
[30:02] by the
[30:04] hundreds,
[30:07] [Laughter]
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Mother Cobi.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; It's a a pillar a pillar in the church.
[30:15] God bless you. I'd like you to just be
[30:18] here with me, brother Caumbi.
[30:20] Well, I make I make some comments and
[30:23] there it's it's very important I think
[30:26] to have your father here at this time.
[30:33] Jesus said
[30:35] that they brought young children to him
[30:40] and you have brought your children and
[30:42] your son that God has given you. Sister
[30:46] Rebecca and brother Toby.
[30:49] And they brought the children to him
[30:51] that he should touch them. And this is
[30:54] what I want to draw the attention to the
[30:58] people that he should touch them.
[31:02] And his disciples rebuked those that
[31:05] brought them. And there may be some here
[31:07] that don't understand it fully.
[31:10] But when Jesus saw it, he was much
[31:12] displeased
[31:14] and said to them, "Suffer the little
[31:16] children to come unto me and forbid them
[31:19] not, for such is the kingdom of God. And
[31:22] whosoever shall receive the kingdom of
[31:24] God as a little child,
[31:27] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[31:29] of God as a little child shall not rece
[31:31] not enter therein." And then it says
[31:34] that he took them up in his arms
[31:38] and put his hands upon them and bless
[31:43] them.
[31:45] Uh this isn't uh you know a baby
[31:48] dedication.
[31:50] This is actually a transfer
[31:53] of the blessings of God upon a child. I
[31:56] began to think about that. I've never
[31:58] really thought about it in the light and
[32:00] in the way that I have been thinking
[32:03] about it for the last day or two.
[32:07] When Jesus was a babe
[32:10] and uh Mary and Joseph brought him,
[32:15] the Bible says that Simeon took up the
[32:18] baby Jesus into his arms
[32:21] and he thanked God that now he had seen
[32:24] the salvation of God.
[32:26] then took he up in his arms and blessed
[32:28] God.
[32:30] That he had seen the salvation of God.
[32:35] Brother Brennham said many, many times,
[32:39] dozens of times, I lay my hands on you
[32:42] for the blessing.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; Why? Why didn't he just say you're I
[32:47] bless you? But he said, I lay my hands
[32:50] on you for the blessing of God.
[32:54] I got thinking about this and brother
[32:56] Toby, sister Rebecca,
[32:59] it's why I wanted your father here also.
[33:04] Joseph brought his sons to his father
[33:07] Jacob.
[33:08] And he just wanted his father, which
[33:11] would be the grandfather of the
[33:13] children, to lay his hands on them. But
[33:16] he had it figured out in his mind which
[33:19] hand he wanted on which child.
[33:23] So he brought them Manasseh and Ephraim
[33:25] and Manasseh on one side, Ephraim,
[33:28] that he would be that he would be
[33:31] blessed and put the blessing on those
[33:34] children
[33:36] and when when he brought them to the
[33:41] grandfather,
[33:43] Jacob crossed his hands
[33:46] and the father said, "Not so."
[33:51] But when he was crossing his hands,
[33:54] God was reflecting through him the cross
[33:58] of Calvary. Amen.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; And that the blessing, the blessing not
[34:01] only came to the son and in that order,
[34:05] but the blessing came to us.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; And we were reflected back then and he
[34:10] would God was reflecting on earth that
[34:12] the gospel is going to come to the
[34:14] Gentiles.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; I say today, thank God for that touch.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank God that grandfather
[34:22] put his hands on his grandsons and the
[34:26] right ones
[34:28] &gt;&gt; and the blessing would come to us.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; And we are going to lay our hands upon
[34:33] this son who has been named Joshua.
[34:38] I'm saying it correctly. Is that right?
[34:40] Good enough.
[34:42] Samuel.
[34:44] And I learned that his name Samuel.
[34:47] Uh they decided Samuel at quarter to 1
[34:51] this morning.
[34:56] His name was changed at quarter to 1
[34:58] this morning and brother Toby doesn't
[35:01] know this but I had a email from another
[35:04] brother and I wanted to get it and I
[35:06] didn't have a chance to read it. So, I
[35:08] had my Blackberry in my hand trying to
[35:11] find that and I felt it vibrating. I
[35:14] thought, "Who in the world is calling me
[35:17] at quarter to 1 in the morning
[35:20] and I opened it up and it's brother
[35:22] Toby." And he says, "His name's not
[35:25] Andreas, it's Samuel. We've just changed
[35:27] it." So, praise the Lord. We have
[35:30] Joshua,
[35:32] Joshua.
[35:33] Samuel. And it is Samuel of course is L.
[35:39] That means God or God heard. And Joshua
[35:44] is Jehovah.
[35:47] Uh Jehovah is salvation and the existing
[35:50] one. And those things are fine for us to
[35:53] understand. But what's important
[35:56] I want I'm going to take the child. I
[35:58] want your father to lay hands on this
[36:01] child as well as we pray and dedicate
[36:04] it.
[36:06] Amen.
[36:09] Hallelujah.
[36:14] What a sacred moment.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; This child that you've given to brother
[36:19] Toby and Rebecca
[36:23] and father from many, many miles away
[36:26] has come the grandfather and
[36:27] grandmother.
[36:30] And we lay our hands upon this child to
[36:33] dedicate it to you in the name of Jesus
[36:37] Christ. And we pass blessings, oh God,
[36:41] from the father and from the grandfather
[36:43] and from the grandparents
[36:46] down to this child.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; May this child be a blessing in the
[36:50] home. Hallelujah.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; May this child be blessed with good
[36:54] health. May this child be blessed as a
[36:57] vessel of the testimony of Jesus Christ.
[37:00] I pray, oh God, that you'll give the
[37:03] mother and father wisdom to guide the
[37:06] footsteps and to teach him the word of
[37:10] God in the name of Jesus Christ. May
[37:13] revelation come to him early
[37:15] &gt;&gt; and Lord may he be a great blessing I
[37:17] pray amongst others as he grows up to be
[37:22] uh to be a real example father keep them
[37:25] in good health I pray and now Lord we
[37:29] pass these blessings the blessings of
[37:32] our Lord Jesus Christ as we stand here
[37:34] as your servants
[37:36] in Jesus name we dedicate him to you
[37:41] amen
[37:41] &gt;&gt; amen
[37:42] Hallelujah.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Toby.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Bless you.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. God bless you.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Well, we're happy to have all the
[38:03] visitors that are with us and uh a lot
[38:07] of our people are away. Some are down in
[38:10] in Seattle to the want to have a service
[38:13] there this morning. So that was fine. We
[38:16] want them to know we miss them.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, we certainly do. This evening where
[38:23] we have a special treat. We have our
[38:26] brother Bill Ivy, pastor from Gibson's,
[38:30] Missouri, and his wife, Sister Mary are
[38:33] here with us. I'd like if they would
[38:36] stand so you'll know who's going to be
[38:37] speaking tonight.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; God bless you. We've known our brother
[38:50] and sister Ivy for
[38:52] quite a few years and uh I I've had the
[38:55] privilege of being to their church on
[38:57] one occasion. We really appreciate that.
[39:00] And we have staying with us in our home
[39:04] uh brother Gerard and sister Angela
[39:07] Michel. And I'd like them to stand
[39:10] because I want to make a special uh note
[39:14] about Sam. God bless them.
[39:22] This is the couple that one day about
[39:25] six years ago, I read an email and we
[39:28] get quite a few emails each day and I
[39:30] was reading the email and uh and I'm
[39:34] sure they won't mind me just saying
[39:36] this. I'll make it brief. I just started
[39:38] I made maybe read two lines and just you
[39:41] know we we streamed the meeting and I or
[39:44] I streamed the meeting. I enjoyed the
[39:47] the service and just at that time the
[39:50] Holy Spirit spoke as clear as I'm
[39:51] speaking to you. He said, "This is from
[39:54] a wounded one
[39:57] and her husband doesn't know she sent
[40:00] this."
[40:02] And it was the sister Angela
[40:05] and I got maybe two or three more over
[40:07] spread over some weeks. And then I got
[40:10] quite a long one email one day.
[40:12] Sometimes they were fairly long. And I
[40:15] just started to read that email and just
[40:17] as I started to read it, the same voice
[40:22] said, "Now her husband knows."
[40:25] And I looked quickly to the bottom of I
[40:27] scrolled down to the bottom and it was
[40:29] the same same last name. I said, "Well,
[40:32] isn't that something?" And then they
[40:34] invited us to come and stay in their
[40:36] home. Uh and uh I and my wife we we were
[40:41] going to Ukraine and we had 5 days that
[40:46] were we we didn't really have we we were
[40:50] over there already in Europe and we had
[40:53] 5 days before we had to go to the
[40:54] Ukraine and it was kind of an awkward
[40:57] timing and awkward scheduling and we
[41:00] said well let's let's see if uh it would
[41:03] be all right for us to visit brother
[41:05] George and sister Angela we ever met.
[41:09] And uh so they picked us up and took us
[41:12] to their home and gave us a beautiful
[41:15] room and and I sat there and we hardly
[41:19] ever ever stay in people's homes. I stay
[41:24] locked up in a motel. I study. I go to
[41:26] the meeting and go back to the room. And
[41:29] that's been our schedule. And I'm
[41:31] sitting in this room and I said to my
[41:33] wife,
[41:35] "What are we doing here?
[41:37] This is so strange. What are we doing
[41:40] here?" And uh from that such a
[41:42] friendship and a bond and God has opened
[41:45] a door uh to others and uh we've made
[41:49] wonderful friends amongst them. And so
[41:51] thank you, brother George and sister
[41:53] Angela. We have also and I failed to
[41:56] mention brother Joe Riley is here. I saw
[42:00] you, brother Riley, in the one of the
[42:02] last services and failed to mention you
[42:05] you being there. Brother Riley was with
[42:07] brother Brandham, his son, and they took
[42:10] him out fishing and all these things. I
[42:12] wonder, brother Joe Riley, if you would
[42:14] stand because
[42:18] our brother Joe Riley has passed 90
[42:20] years old.
[42:29] Past 90, isn't that right? You've had
[42:31] your 90 birthday and he's up here
[42:34] fishing. Lord, I've got a few years yet.
[42:39] only have some people take me fishing.
[42:44] That's wonderful. Yeah, I think brother
[42:47] Mark Matul and others may be taking
[42:50] brother Joe Riley fishing. Well, I I I'm
[42:53] proud of you, brother Riley, and and
[42:55] envious. And he's had a lot of
[42:57] experiences and gave a testimony also.
[43:00] We're just thankful for everyone. Won't
[43:02] it be wonderful when we aren't
[43:04] restricted with time and we don't have
[43:07] to have a service as such? We'll be
[43:09] around the marriage uh wedding table, a
[43:13] supper, and that's that's only the
[43:15] beginning.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Then from then on, what are we going to
[43:20] do?
[43:21] &gt;&gt; We're going to worship him. We're going
[43:22] to fellowship. We're going to And it's
[43:26] hard to conceive eternity, isn't it?
[43:30] &gt;&gt; But you do believe it, do you?
[43:34] I can't even say it's going to be a long
[43:36] time because there is no time.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; That's why we're here this morning.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Well, we could talk on and on, but we
[43:45] want you to stand if you would, and
[43:48] we're going to read the word of God.
[43:52] Uh, where's Brother Timothy from
[43:56] Johannesburg and his wife Shantel?
[44:05] right here. Brother Timothy,
[44:08] raise your hand. This brother flew the
[44:11] other day with his whole family, his
[44:13] wife, and two children, Brother Paul,
[44:15] his son, and we sort of respect them. He
[44:19] flies here for his vacation
[44:24] from Johannesburg just to have vacation
[44:27] to be here at the church. God bless you,
[44:29] brother Timothy and Sister Shantel. We
[44:32] appreciate that.
[44:40] Let's just have a word of prayer before
[44:41] we read.
[44:44] Dear Father, how lovely it is, your
[44:48] presence,
[44:50] your holiness,
[44:52] clean spirit, Holy Spirit.
[44:56] how we love your Holy Spirit, oh God,
[44:59] and that you have filled us with that
[45:02] Holy Ghost. And if there's any here that
[45:04] have not experienced that that baptism,
[45:08] they may have been in water, but may
[45:10] they be baptized
[45:12] &gt;&gt; with the Holy Spirit, even while the
[45:14] word is being preached.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Let them receive the word and the spirit
[45:18] will come and make the word alive.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; This is your promise. It is yay and amen
[45:23] to all who believe. Lord, we thank you
[45:25] for all the people that are here this
[45:28] morning and the guests that have come
[45:30] and we just pray your blessing upon the
[45:32] reading of the word and the and the
[45:34] message this morning that you've laid
[45:36] upon my heart. We just commit this time
[45:38] to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Just before we read, we have uh our
[45:46] graduates which we had a graduation time
[45:50] last night. Could you put that picture
[45:53] up, please?
[45:57] Can we dim the lights, please?
[46:09] Isn't that a nice group? I just want to
[46:12] say something about this group. Every
[46:15] single one of them
[46:17] expressed such a desire for God in their
[46:21] heart. And I had more people come to me
[46:24] last night than at any graduation I've
[46:28] ever been in. And one even I got an
[46:31] email this morning said it was like a
[46:32] service. It was such a godly atmosphere.
[46:36] There was no frivolity. There was no
[46:39] nonsense. It was just a lovely lovely
[46:42] atmosphere. And all of you people that
[46:44] were there, we appreciate that. And I
[46:46] say to these graduates, God bless you
[46:50] and God grant the desire of their heart
[46:53] and the scriptures. They all gave
[46:55] scriptures and quotes that God had made
[46:58] real to them. And I pray that that God
[47:01] will lead you all the days of your life
[47:04] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you. If you'll take your Bibles
[47:09] and open please to Matthew's Gospel, the
[47:12] 16th chapter.
[47:19] We'll read from the 13th verse.
[47:30] When Jesus came into the coast of
[47:32] Cesaria Philippi, he asked his
[47:35] disciples, saying, "Whom do men say that
[47:38] I, the Son of Man, am?"
[47:41] And they said, "Some say that thou art
[47:43] John the Baptist, some Elias, and others
[47:46] Jeremas or one of the prophets?" He said
[47:50] unto them, "But whom say ye that I am?"
[47:54] And Simon Peter said unto him, answered
[47:56] and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son
[47:59] of the living God." And Jesus answered
[48:02] and said unto him, Blessed art thou
[48:05] Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath
[48:08] not revealed it unto thee, but my father
[48:11] which is in heaven. And I say unto thee,
[48:14] that thou art Peter, and upon this rock
[48:17] I will build my church, and the gates of
[48:20] hell shall not prevail against it. And I
[48:24] will give unto thee the keys of the
[48:26] kingdom of heaven. And whosoever thou
[48:28] shalt and whatsoever thou shalt bind on
[48:30] earth shall be bound in heaven. And
[48:34] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[48:36] shall be loosed in heaven.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; You may have your seats.
[48:44] I'm going to move along as quickly as
[48:46] possible. I will ask for your full and
[48:50] kind attention and as little movement as
[48:53] possible please so that we can remain as
[48:57] focused as possible. This is uh the
[49:02] message I think will be in in in
[49:04] simplicity and yet in simplicity often
[49:09] in fact is very often there is depth
[49:12] that's almost incomprehensible
[49:14] and that and God is in simplicity. It's
[49:17] simplicity that's our problem friends.
[49:20] It is so simple. We go over it or it
[49:23] goes over our heads. So ask that God
[49:26] will give you such discernment and that
[49:29] such a grasp of the simplicity of the
[49:32] gospel that we'll be able to grasp the
[49:35] thought Jesus has said here and the
[49:39] these phrases. I
[49:43] will build
[49:45] my church or my called out ones.
[49:50] And quite frankly, that's the only
[49:52] church that exists. There's other
[49:54] gatherings. There's other clubs. There's
[49:57] other
[49:59] churches as
[50:01] uh as we speak of them as being
[50:05] churches. But the only church that
[50:08] actually exists is what Jesus has called
[50:12] and claimed my church.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; That's the church. Because the church is
[50:18] the ecclesia. It is the called out
[50:21] persons. And if they're called out,
[50:24] something and someone had to call them
[50:27] out. And he says, "This is my church.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; I will build it. There is no other
[50:34] builder than he himself who is the
[50:37] creator of all things. All things were
[50:40] made by him, including the church.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; And without him was nothing made that is
[50:47] made.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; He is the word of God that came out of
[50:53] the bosom of the father, which we'll go
[50:55] into just a little bit later. And it is
[50:59] supremely supremely important to
[51:04] identify
[51:06] I.
[51:07] Who is this? I will build my church. Is
[51:10] it the man Jesus of Nazareth that walked
[51:15] the shores of Galilee and lived in
[51:16] Nazareth? Who's who was born of the
[51:19] Virgin Mary? Well, in part that is so.
[51:23] Yet uh I can tell you that when Peter
[51:27] said, "Thou art the Christ,"
[51:31] &gt;&gt; he was not looking just merely at the
[51:35] man, the physical man that was standing
[51:37] in front of him. He was looking into the
[51:40] unseen. He was looking beyond the flesh.
[51:44] He was looking beyond this physical one
[51:47] who got weary and had to sleep, who
[51:51] persspired like anyone else in the heat,
[51:54] who got hungry and had to eat, who uh
[51:57] who who who lived a very common life.
[52:00] And because of that that common life
[52:02] that he lived, everybody for the most
[52:06] part missed him. So he said, "Who do
[52:08] they say that I am?" And some said,
[52:11] "He's a good man.
[52:13] He is a great teacher.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Uh he is one of the prophets.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; And they had uh many phrases. They said
[52:22] uh hosana
[52:25] &gt;&gt; a week before he was crucified. Hosana
[52:29] &gt;&gt; in the highest
[52:31] &gt;&gt; uh the king of the the son of David.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; But they were still missing it
[52:36] &gt;&gt; to the woman at the well. Uh, she said,
[52:39] 'I perceive that you're a prophet, a
[52:42] compliment. You're Elijah, a compliment.
[52:45] Are you John the Baptist that has raised
[52:47] from the dead? Are you Elijah? Are you
[52:50] Jeremiah? Are you one of the prophets
[52:53] that has come? Those are all
[52:55] compliments. But none of those
[52:57] confessions would put a person into his
[53:01] church. That's right.
[53:04] [Applause]
[53:06] &gt;&gt; In Christ is the mystery of God
[53:08] revealed. And follow this very close if
[53:10] you would. And if you wish to make a
[53:12] note, it's fine.
[53:14] Brother Brandham asked a question. How
[53:16] do you know it's this is right? How do
[53:18] you know it's right? He here's the
[53:21] answer. He the word is vindicated.
[53:26] Vindicated simply means to show somebody
[53:29] or something that it's correct.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; To demonstrate it's proven correct.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; It's unmistakably correct.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Unqualified correct.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; God proves it correct.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Supernaturally. He proves it correct.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; It's vindicated. And by identifying that
[53:53] you become
[53:56] a material, a building stone
[54:00] &gt;&gt; for his church.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; And he said the word is vindicated. He
[54:06] the word properly properly vindicated is
[54:12] the headship.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; The head of the church.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; He's the word, the headship. Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; He's properly identified.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Properly identified. We're talking about
[54:27] building the church. He said, "How do
[54:29] you know it's right?" It's vindicated.
[54:31] It's properly identified.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; And then vindicated by his own spirit.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; It's not someone's enthusiasm. It's not
[54:41] someone else's inspiration. It's not
[54:44] some very uh uh someone who is an actor
[54:48] and can put the words and thoughts and
[54:50] connect things together. It's not that.
[54:52] It's not a human uh inspiration. It is
[54:56] the spirit of God that comes and
[54:59] supernaturally does something that no
[55:02] man can do and proves that the word that
[55:05] is spoken is true. Amen.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; And when you identify that
[55:11] &gt;&gt; as being that has to be Messiah,
[55:14] &gt;&gt; that is the word of God,
[55:17] &gt;&gt; then you become qualified
[55:20] &gt;&gt; to be put into this building.
[55:24] And he said
[55:27] &gt;&gt; by his own spirit
[55:29] being in the church itself. The person.
[55:33] The person.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Not just a good feeling. The person,
[55:37] friends,
[55:38] &gt;&gt; we're talking about a person.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be stressing this very
[55:43] strong.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Showing forth himself.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; The person showing forth himself by
[55:50] vindicating.
[55:53] I'm not doing the vindicating. He's
[55:54] doing the vindicating.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; And and and the message which we
[55:58] believe, which I have been stressing
[56:01] over the last months, the message we
[56:03] believe, it's not because it's some
[56:06] formulated doctrine has come out of some
[56:08] school. God took a vessel and proved
[56:13] supernaturally
[56:14] all the years that the vessel uh uh
[56:18] ministered uh every all the years that
[56:20] brother Brandham was present right to
[56:23] the very end right to the very end
[56:25] proved that that was God's word
[56:29] &gt;&gt; you have to identify that it's God's
[56:32] word
[56:33] &gt;&gt; not a man's word
[56:34] &gt;&gt; and God didn't say now you all have to
[56:36] go and do the same thing No, Jesus said,
[56:39] "Believe on him whom God has sent."
[56:43] &gt;&gt; How do we do the works of God? They want
[56:45] to do something. How do we do the works
[56:47] of God? This is the works of God that
[56:49] you believe on him whom God has sent.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; God so loved the world, he gave one of
[56:58] the graduates was favorite scripture.
[57:01] God so loved the world, he gave his only
[57:04] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[57:08] him should not perish but have
[57:11] everlasting life, eternal life,
[57:14] &gt;&gt; believing on him whom God hath sent.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "If you don't believe
[57:22] me, believe for the work's sake. Believe
[57:25] the supernatural things that are
[57:27] happening." Amen.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; He said showing himself in vindication
[57:32] is the direct proof of the entire body.
[57:38] [Music]
[57:39] &gt;&gt; He said you don't need creeds then.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; You don't need denominations.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; He said denominations has perished. But
[57:47] the headship itself recognized in the
[57:50] body by the personal identification
[57:55] personally identifying himself proves
[57:58] the headship to the body.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Then then notice the word then we are
[58:06] united.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Our vindicated headship that is Christ.
[58:12] That's Christ.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; That's a person. That's not a book.
[58:17] That's not a tape. That's not It's not
[58:19] even this book. This book is what speaks
[58:22] of him. But he is a person.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; He's alive
[58:27] &gt;&gt; by his holy spirit.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; He's present
[58:32] &gt;&gt; by his spirit.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; One vindicated headship that is Christ,
[58:39] the word of God, not under any church.
[58:43] He said then our headship is a kingdom.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; So now I want to
[58:52] move into this phase. The method
[58:57] the method because brother Brandham said
[58:58] he doesn't change his method. The method
[59:00] of this divine builder is to reveal
[59:05] himself. That's what we've just been
[59:07] reading. The method
[59:09] of this builder is to reveal himself or
[59:14] make himself known to you personally.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Now it's not just a single experience.
[59:21] This is a continual life.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; He continues to reveal himself to us
[59:26] personally. And by that inner knowledge
[59:29] or that inner revelation, you are shaped
[59:34] &gt;&gt; from the inside out.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:38] He said the first thing that he wanted
[59:39] to do now this God that we are here this
[59:43] morning
[59:44] worshiping and saying that we are his
[59:48] children.
[59:49] He said God wanted to reveal himself
[59:54] &gt;&gt; to the people and he could not do it as
[59:58] a great Jehovah. You've heard me quote
[1:00:00] this perhaps many times. He couldn't do
[1:00:03] it as a great Jehovah God who covered
[1:00:06] all space, time, and eternity.
[1:00:09] It starts to make us very feel very
[1:00:12] insignificant.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; And this goes far beyond us. We've had
[1:00:16] young people just graduate. I can tell
[1:00:18] you, you could live a thousand years and
[1:00:21] you'll never figure this one out. You'll
[1:00:23] never figure God out.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; This God that fills all God fills all
[1:00:29] space. He fills the space between you
[1:00:31] and I.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; God fills all time and space. He doesn't
[1:00:36] know anything about yesterday or
[1:00:38] tomorrow. God's eternal.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; He's allotted time for us humans and for
[1:00:44] his creation. And it it evolves and
[1:00:46] changes. But God God has never had a
[1:00:50] beginning. You can't figure that out.
[1:00:52] God will never have an end. You can't
[1:00:54] figure that out. And that God spoke out
[1:00:57] of his own being eternal words and
[1:01:00] became manifested here on earth in
[1:01:02] certain human beings. And that's why
[1:01:04] Jesus said, "My sheep hear my voice."
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; And those sheep are as eternal as he is.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; And I will not lose one of them.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; And if you're here in that state,
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; that ought to thrill your soul.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; And God, but he wanted to be made known.
[1:01:29] He said he's too great to ever be
[1:01:31] revealed to the people because it would
[1:01:34] be too mysterious. It is mysterious even
[1:01:38] when I try to consider it and think of
[1:01:40] it. How could that great being that
[1:01:43] never did begin and after you went
[1:01:45] beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions
[1:01:49] and trillions and trillions of years of
[1:01:52] light space? It's amazing how brother
[1:01:54] Brandham uses scientific terminology of
[1:01:57] light space
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; that didn't come from a seventh grade
[1:02:01] seventh grade a seventh grade education
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; times of light space billions and
[1:02:07] trillions and trillions of years of
[1:02:09] light space
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; and on out into the infinite into
[1:02:14] eternity
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; and a great creature that was all of
[1:02:18] that and still is now all of that
[1:02:20] mysterious here the prophet brings this
[1:02:22] great mysterious uh uh incomprehensible
[1:02:26] God and he brings it down. But what he
[1:02:29] wanted to do,
[1:02:32] he loved. He pulls out of the very heart
[1:02:35] of God. He loved fatherhood.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; This is Father's Day. I think like what
[1:02:41] brother John said, every day is Father's
[1:02:43] Day really. But he loved fatherhood.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; And he said, "For he was a father." that
[1:02:49] attribute was in him to be a father. And
[1:02:52] if he had that attribute in him to be a
[1:02:54] father, he needed to have a son.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; He needed to have a family.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; And he and he goes on to say he was a
[1:03:01] father. And please note this. Please put
[1:03:06] it on your fridge, on your wall. At
[1:03:09] least hold it in your heart. And the
[1:03:12] only way,
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; the only way that he could express
[1:03:18] express it was to become a son of man.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; He had to become a son of man. When you
[1:03:28] identify the son of man, Jesus Christ,
[1:03:33] it was him.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; It was he who was the in expression of
[1:03:39] the invisible God. And the little things
[1:03:41] that he did, taking up a child in his
[1:03:44] arms is part of the attribute of God.
[1:03:48] God wanted to embrace children.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; His attribute, his son embraced
[1:03:54] children. God wanted to touch the sick.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; And so his son touched the sick.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; And they were supernaturally healed.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:06] And that is why the prophet of God in
[1:04:08] this age which was called to reveal the
[1:04:12] son of man touch the people.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Come and let me bless you.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; And they came. And you know what? They
[1:04:21] were blessed.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; They did receive the blessing.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Multitudes received the blessing. Why?
[1:04:29] because it was the father who loved
[1:04:31] fatherhood revealing the son of man in
[1:04:35] this hour.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; And that's the only way that this great
[1:04:42] eternal
[1:04:44] being beyond all science, beyond all
[1:04:48] learning, beyond our puny, insignificant
[1:04:51] minds,
[1:04:53] the only way he could be understood. And
[1:04:55] when that great one,
[1:04:58] our father, which art in heaven,
[1:05:03] hallowed be thy name,
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; thy kingdom come,
[1:05:08] and thy will be done
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; on earth
[1:05:13] as it is in heaven.
[1:05:16] In heaven, he wanted a family. In
[1:05:20] heaven, he wanted to touch people. In
[1:05:22] heaven, he wanted to embrace him. In
[1:05:24] heaven, he wanted them to know him.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; How could he be known in heaven? He
[1:05:33] wanted a response,
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; not forced.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; He wanted a response from the people. He
[1:05:40] wanted he wanted to become made so real
[1:05:42] and so close in his presence to just
[1:05:46] permeate people that they freely would
[1:05:48] say, "Oh, father."
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. how I love you.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you for sending forth Jesus
[1:05:56] Christ. Thank you for revealing your
[1:05:58] word. Thank you, Lord. You've revealed
[1:06:01] your word. I see the person.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Not a book, not a stack of books, not
[1:06:07] just a lot of technical tech technical
[1:06:10] things, but I see a person. The person
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; I feel the touch.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:21] Recognizing
[1:06:23] that
[1:06:25] when you recognize that which I've just
[1:06:28] described
[1:06:30] and you recognize it, it's not this
[1:06:33] building, not any building.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; It's a persons
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; who've come in direct contact
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; with the by the Holy Spirit
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; with this person
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ, God revealed
[1:06:49] Hallelujah.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; And you identify that that is the one
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; that is one that Jesus Christ has said,
[1:06:58] "Blessed art thou Simon Barjonah."
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; When he said, "Thou art the Christ, the
[1:07:03] son of the living God. Blessed art thou,
[1:07:06] Simon Barjonah,
[1:07:08] flesh and blood has not revealed this
[1:07:10] unto you, but my father which is in
[1:07:11] heaven, and upon this rock, upon that
[1:07:14] kind of a confession." He couldn't make
[1:07:16] the confession till he saw the person.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:19] Yes, sir.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just the man walking. It
[1:07:22] wasn't just Jesus of Nazareth. It was He
[1:07:25] saw the son of God.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; He saw the He saw what came out of the
[1:07:30] bosom of the father.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; The invisible God which cannot be
[1:07:37] understood by the human mind.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Determined that he would make himself
[1:07:43] known to his creation. And I want to
[1:07:47] just direct your thoughts into two into
[1:07:50] two phases here that he determined that
[1:07:53] he would make himself known. One is by
[1:07:56] direct revelation
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; and the second is by
[1:08:01] taking human vessels whom he called
[1:08:05] prophets and to speak his spoken word
[1:08:08] through them. And that word then to you
[1:08:11] does not become some intellectual
[1:08:14] understanding. That word to you becomes
[1:08:16] an illumination within and it becomes a
[1:08:19] person to you
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; and you engage into a relationship with
[1:08:24] that person
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; and then you are built into the church
[1:08:28] and that is the church Jesus was talking
[1:08:31] about. There is no other church and I
[1:08:33] want to speak about how that church is
[1:08:35] built. how that church is made.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; So by direct revelation,
[1:08:42] I'm going to move just quickly through
[1:08:43] this. By direct revelation, Abel,
[1:08:48] Abel, Brother Brandham says Abel,
[1:08:52] quoting the scripture, by faith offered
[1:08:55] unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
[1:08:58] that of Cain. Both boys offered.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Both boys prayed. Amen.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Both boys built an altar.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Both boys worship the same God.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Nothing's changed, friends.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; We got the same thing today.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; There's people in this building or
[1:09:15] people in that building or people they
[1:09:17] call the Billings church. It's not the
[1:09:18] church. It's buildings.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; They're in that sanctuary or this temple
[1:09:23] or they're in that synagogue or whatever
[1:09:25] more. The buildings is irrelevant to
[1:09:28] God. It's what's inside the building.
[1:09:31] And the only there's only one church.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; It's the church that Jesus built.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; And that church is living stones,
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; living people who have actually seen the
[1:09:46] supernatural be vindicated.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; When I hear it or I read it, I see it
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; and I say, "That's a person. That's my
[1:09:56] God. That's my Lord Jesus Christ. That's
[1:09:59] the revelation of God Almighty. I see
[1:10:02] him. I want to enter into a relationship
[1:10:05] with him. I want to walk closer with him
[1:10:08] because I know that's the only material
[1:10:10] that Jesus Christ can take and say, "I
[1:10:13] will build my church."
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, outside of that,
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; there's really nothing in this world.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; We might as well just live like a bunch
[1:10:24] of animals and eat, drink, and be merry
[1:10:27] and
[1:10:28] die like
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; all flesh.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Not for me, friends.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; If there is a if there is a possibility
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; of having eternal life,
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; one thing is absolutely certain.
[1:10:47] Everybody who's living and and present
[1:10:49] in this building today, you you were
[1:10:51] born
[1:10:53] and you were born of a woman.
[1:10:57] you issued from some woman's womb.
[1:11:00] And I can guarantee you,
[1:11:03] every person is going to take their last
[1:11:05] breath outside of the rapture, which is
[1:11:09] the change of the body while we're
[1:11:11] alive.
[1:11:13] And that's a mysterious thing, too. But
[1:11:14] it's promised.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; We shall not all die. We shall be
[1:11:18] changed.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; That's a promise. We shall be changed. I
[1:11:24] don't even understand how I was formed
[1:11:25] in my mother's womb. Do you? I don't
[1:11:28] even know. I started from a spine and
[1:11:30] and and how these organs work and how it
[1:11:32] all began to function in the in the and
[1:11:35] the few seconds of in the birth and how
[1:11:38] I took a breath and how I came. I don't
[1:11:40] understand anything about it. Neither do
[1:11:41] you.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, we can get into the technicalities
[1:11:47] of of of the medical field. What is it
[1:11:50] that came that
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; burst of breath of life
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; and a prophet comes said a spirit
[1:11:57] entered it. The human spirit entered it
[1:11:59] and we became alive.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; But Abel had a direct revelation.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; And somehow it was just something in
[1:12:12] him. He knew there wasn't any and nobody
[1:12:16] told him. His father mother didn't teach
[1:12:19] him but he went out to the field and he
[1:12:21] starts searching for a certain kind of a
[1:12:23] a lamb.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he picks the right kind
[1:12:27] of lamb and he begins to slay this lamb
[1:12:31] to see blood to pay for the redemption.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, the Bible is full of
[1:12:40] strange things.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; And I know we like to have church and
[1:12:45] have everything nice. So in order
[1:12:47] everything everything clean and quiet or
[1:12:49] whatever more. Uh but let me just tell
[1:12:51] you friends sometimes God allows some
[1:12:55] things that are very irregular to happen
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; and we're not in control of it.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; But we want to say father God have your
[1:13:02] way
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; whatever it takes to glorify yourself.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; And he says both boys worship the same
[1:13:13] God.
[1:13:16] Do you believe that?
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Both boys worshiped the same God and one
[1:13:20] was accepted and the other was turned
[1:13:23] down.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I will build my church."
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Lots of people are in buildings and some
[1:13:31] are accepted and others are turned down.
[1:13:34] I'm sorry, friends, and I'm not sorry. I
[1:13:36] don't apologize. That that was the bare
[1:13:38] naked facts.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Some are accepted and some are turned
[1:13:43] down. There's only one way to be built
[1:13:46] into this and that is by a revelation
[1:13:48] from God by the Holy Spirit. That the
[1:13:51] message that came to you is the person
[1:13:54] of Jesus Christ.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; And there is no other way.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; That's the only way that he can become a
[1:14:03] father
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; and it's the only way you can become a
[1:14:07] son
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; or a daughter.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; There is no other way.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? There is no other way.
[1:14:14] Has nothing to do with our background or
[1:14:17] or the the things that we experienced or
[1:14:19] I saw flashes of light. Just forget all
[1:14:22] of that.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; I heard the word
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; from a messenger
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; that was supernaturally
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; vindicated.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Proven correct.
[1:14:36] I played a tape for a very dear friend
[1:14:38] of mine, Catholic all his life, still a
[1:14:41] Catholic today, a fine person. Do you
[1:14:45] know that? He told me he goes every
[1:14:47] morning to the church and prays. He told
[1:14:51] me that not very long ago.
[1:14:54] I go to the church every morning and
[1:14:57] pray that I may enter into the kingdom.
[1:15:07] I doubt if there's anybody here that
[1:15:08] does that.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; If it was on sincerity, he ought to make
[1:15:18] it.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; And he's sincere. He had an aneurysm. He
[1:15:26] hunted between life and death.
[1:15:29] And he said since that time
[1:15:33] and we worked together in the same
[1:15:35] office.
[1:15:36] He was even my partner
[1:15:39] and at noon he would go up to the any
[1:15:42] church that was close and pray.
[1:15:46] And he told me I pray every morning
[1:15:50] that I may enter into the kingdom.
[1:15:55] I pray that God will reveal himself. I
[1:15:58] played a tape. We were traveling
[1:16:00] together and I had brother Brandham on.
[1:16:02] And brother Brandham now comes with the
[1:16:04] vindication
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; and begins to tell the people the secret
[1:16:08] of their hearts and he's listening. And
[1:16:11] I asked him, I said, "Bob, did any of
[1:16:15] your popes ever do that?"
[1:16:20] He said, "No,
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; that should have been enough."
[1:16:27] Did any of the great church leaders do
[1:16:31] that for 30 years? No.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; That's why I believe it.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm a I'm a fanatic if they
[1:16:41] wish to say or a heretic if they wish to
[1:16:44] say. But God Almighty, this God that
[1:16:47] cannot be seen and cannot be felt and
[1:16:49] cannot be understood. He's too
[1:16:51] mysterious. But he came down
[1:16:55] in this generation
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; and made it very clear this is me
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; and when you say that is the Christ
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; that's the word of God
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; that is the Messiah
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; and Jesus is saying clearly to you
[1:17:15] you're the material
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; I'll build my church
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; and you become a part of the church
[1:17:23] the church.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Don't go away from here saying I said
[1:17:28] coil Bible way is the church. No, the
[1:17:31] church is the called out ones.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; All over the earth, the church is the
[1:17:36] called out ones.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; But Satan knowing that this is the only
[1:17:41] way that you can come in. He has a
[1:17:44] myriad,
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; a multitude
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; of substitutes
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; that are so close.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, I felt something. That doesn't mean
[1:17:56] a thing.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; You don't have to feel something. You
[1:17:59] have to believe something.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; I felt such a warm feeling. Or I wept.
[1:18:09] It was such an experience. You might
[1:18:11] have all of those, but there's one thing
[1:18:13] that you must do. You must hear the word
[1:18:17] that God has sent and believe it with
[1:18:20] all your heart and soul.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; And that is when God starts to take you
[1:18:27] and shape you
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; so that you can be built into the
[1:18:31] kingdom
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; of God.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, friends, don't take
[1:18:37] this message lightly. This is the only
[1:18:39] church. That's the only church.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Not this building.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "No one told
[1:18:50] no one told Abel that Cain was wrong."
[1:18:54] Brother Brandham even says about about
[1:18:56] Cain.
[1:18:58] No one told him he was wrong
[1:19:02] when he was doing all of his worshiping.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; He says it has come. It it has to come
[1:19:08] spiritual revelation. Flesh and blood.
[1:19:11] Never told Cain that he was wrong. Never
[1:19:14] told Abel that Cain was wrong.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; But it was a revelation that Abel had.
[1:19:21] He had something
[1:19:23] come over him.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Somehow
[1:19:28] it's blood.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; I've got to shed some blood.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; He'd never seen it done before. It had
[1:19:35] never been taught before. There was no
[1:19:37] books.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Nobody told him to do it.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; You might hear this message for the
[1:19:44] first time and nobody told you that this
[1:19:46] is the this is thus say the Lord that
[1:19:49] this is the way to eternal life. But you
[1:19:51] heard it and something inside of you
[1:19:53] said, "I believe that."
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Even before you knew what it was all
[1:19:59] about. Even before you knew what was
[1:20:02] required of you, there was something
[1:20:04] inside said, "I believe that
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; and furthermore, this is what I must do
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; and this is the way I must go."
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; And nobody's telling me that I got to go
[1:20:14] this way. But something inside is saying
[1:20:16] I must go this way.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:21] [Music]
[1:20:23] We had a little brother. He was a
[1:20:25] Catholic brother. I had his funeral.
[1:20:30] He became very very dear to me. Brother
[1:20:32] Amy Mulan,
[1:20:35] most of this church knew him.
[1:20:38] And brother Amy told me, he says,
[1:20:41] "Brother Ed, when I first heard this
[1:20:43] message, because he had given himself in
[1:20:46] the Catholic faith, he even went over to
[1:20:48] Borneo on a on a on a on a ship,
[1:20:51] missionary ship. He was doing
[1:20:53] everything. He was giving himself
[1:20:55] religiously as he was just literally
[1:20:58] throwing himself into it. You know why?
[1:21:00] He was an alcoholic.
[1:21:03] And he thought if he could just do
[1:21:04] enough things and get religious enough,
[1:21:07] he'll get free of this demon.
[1:21:10] And it never helped him. He went, he
[1:21:13] just did everything he could. His
[1:21:16] brother heard our radio broadcast over
[1:21:18] in Vancouver Island and became
[1:21:21] a believer. I went over and there was
[1:21:24] about 20some charismatics
[1:21:27] and rather Amy's brother and his wife
[1:21:29] who are over in brother Rogers church
[1:21:32] Roger Smith's church right now been
[1:21:34] wonderful believers
[1:21:37] and they came and he said he said they
[1:21:40] talked to me about the message he said
[1:21:43] to brother Ed I could have raised up a
[1:21:47] thousand arguments
[1:21:49] in my mind all the arguments came. But
[1:21:52] he said, "My heart said it's the truth."
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; And you know how he really knew it was
[1:21:59] the truth? He was delivered instantly.
[1:22:02] [Music]
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; And he called up his mom who was over in
[1:22:05] Vancouver Island. Mom, he said, "I'm
[1:22:08] free. I'm delivered from alcohol." She
[1:22:10] said, "Oh." He said, "Come back in six
[1:22:13] months."
[1:22:15] Said, "I've heard this before." And he
[1:22:17] was all down hard. He says, "What do I
[1:22:20] do, brother Ed?" I says, "Go back in six
[1:22:22] months."
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; He called her in six months, said, "Hi,
[1:22:27] Mom. I'm still delivered." She says,
[1:22:29] "Ah, I've seen this and heard this all
[1:22:32] before." You know, and he come back to
[1:22:35] me all discouraged. He said, "What I
[1:22:36] do?" I said, "Go back in a year."
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; And he lived that life
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; till he walked into eternity.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, others have quit. We're not talking
[1:22:50] about that. I'm talking about I'm
[1:22:52] talking about being delivered.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Other people quit cigarettes or quit
[1:22:57] this or quit that other hab, but that
[1:22:58] doesn't mean anything. I'm talking about
[1:23:00] a man who fought with this all of his
[1:23:02] life and was delivered by believing
[1:23:04] something.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Believing something that his mind was
[1:23:07] arguing against, but his heart was
[1:23:10] saying, "I believe it."
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; That's what caused Abel to slay the
[1:23:15] lamb.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; I have to believe it. Amen.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; I hope you're having as good a time as I
[1:23:22] am.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; It was a revelation that Abel had
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; that it was blood.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Once we have a true revelation of the I
[1:23:38] am,
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; then we can know who is doing the
[1:23:42] building.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; The God-given revelation of who Christ
[1:23:48] or the anointed word is in each
[1:23:51] generation
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; is the rock
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; on which Jesus Christ is building his
[1:23:57] church.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; I just read that note because I had to.
[1:24:01] The way it had come in the message lamb
[1:24:04] and the dove he said and upon this rock
[1:24:07] I'll build my church and the gates of
[1:24:09] hell can't prevail against it. What is
[1:24:12] it then? The rock that it's built on is
[1:24:15] a divine revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:24:21] is
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; and the gates of hell cannot prevail
[1:24:26] against it.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Revelation
[1:24:31] even amongst the messages very much
[1:24:33] misunderstood.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Very much misunderstood.
[1:24:43] It's more than
[1:24:45] some mental stimulation. We can get
[1:24:47] stimulated, but it's more than
[1:24:48] stimulation. Nothing wrong with
[1:24:50] stimulation. I get very stimulated,
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; but it is more than that. It's more than
[1:24:55] any physical feeling.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; It's more than something and I have had
[1:24:59] a lot of people, a lot of people, they
[1:25:03] were brought up oneness and baptism in
[1:25:06] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, but
[1:25:08] still carried a denominational seed.
[1:25:11] Listen, I want to be very clear with
[1:25:13] you. That's a very, very dangerous
[1:25:14] thing. And people hear the message and
[1:25:16] they say, "Oh, of course." Now, they
[1:25:19] feel substantiated. They feel
[1:25:23] strengthened
[1:25:24] in their resolve to believe the doctrine
[1:25:27] they've been taught in when in fact uh
[1:25:30] that had a denomination. If if they if
[1:25:33] they watch it, they would say that the
[1:25:34] groups of people that are gathered
[1:25:36] around the doctrines are and if they go
[1:25:39] any further or go very further into it,
[1:25:41] they'll find they'll find that what he
[1:25:43] taught about how we act and how we
[1:25:45] conduct ourselves and how we dress etc
[1:25:48] etc. It starts to run crosscurrent to
[1:25:51] what those churches so-called believe.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; You understand me? But it's revelation
[1:25:58] is not oh well now uh we've always
[1:26:01] believed the oneness. We've always
[1:26:03] believed baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:26:05] Jesus Christ. Revelation will make known
[1:26:08] Jesus Christ in the scriptures and will
[1:26:11] glorify him.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; The true revelation of Jesus Christ the
[1:26:16] we'll call it the logos. And don't get
[1:26:18] lost when I say that word because the
[1:26:20] logos I want to just give a quote in a
[1:26:23] moment. The log go the prophet said was
[1:26:26] was he said we go back and kind of you
[1:26:29] know in a drama wee bit and he said
[1:26:32] there's a little light that proceeds out
[1:26:34] a little light that appears and it is
[1:26:37] the logos proceeding out of God.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; God fills all time and space. So it's
[1:26:42] not an object as such but this lo this
[1:26:45] light appears this logos because it's
[1:26:48] it's proceeding out of God
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; out of the bosom of the father.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus said I came out of the bosom of
[1:26:56] the father.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; So it came out of that resource of God.
[1:27:01] That love of God. He was the
[1:27:03] personification of the love of God.
[1:27:07] That's why he could love men when they
[1:27:09] spit in his face and pulled his beard
[1:27:12] out and cursed all kinds of cursings and
[1:27:15] could say, "Father, forgive them."
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; They don't know what they're doing.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; And this logos came out of the bosom of
[1:27:28] God
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; and he said it was the son of God. Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; So
[1:27:35] in the scripture they he was called in
[1:27:38] that time a good man, a great teacher, a
[1:27:43] good master, a prophet from Nazareth,
[1:27:46] John the Baptist raised again. Perhaps
[1:27:49] he's Elias or Jeremas or one of the
[1:27:53] other prophets or he's the king of the
[1:27:56] Jews. As Pilate said and wrote over the
[1:28:00] title at the cross,
[1:28:04] you're the son of David. Hosanna.
[1:28:08] And none of those statements put them
[1:28:11] into the church.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; They did not become part of Christ's
[1:28:17] building.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:20] And Jesus had already told what it is
[1:28:23] that's required
[1:28:26] something.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Even Peter even after that great uh uh
[1:28:32] revelation which it was
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; yet he still slipped from that.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; He did not have the fullness of the Holy
[1:28:40] Spirit hold that.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Jesus knew
[1:28:45] that even beyond the denial that he made
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; and the curses that he made at the time
[1:28:50] of the cross at the time of the
[1:28:53] suffering you say it is possible. I'm
[1:28:55] not making excuses now but it is
[1:28:57] possible and I want you to remember that
[1:29:00] and I tried to tell the graduates
[1:29:02] yesterday.
[1:29:04] It is possible that a a soldier, a
[1:29:07] Christian can get bombarded, can find
[1:29:10] themselves in such a such a place that
[1:29:12] they that they weaken or maybe even make
[1:29:16] a denial and and but yet if they're a
[1:29:18] son of God, they will pick themselves
[1:29:21] up.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; They will pick themselves up
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; from the hog pen
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; and something will come within them
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; in their debauchery. They'll say, "I'm
[1:29:33] returning to Father's house."
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Even if you'll just make me a servant,
[1:29:38] I'm going back to Father's house.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; I want to preach on that.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, they had a celebration.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; I just have to hold back.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; But Father didn't say gravel down here
[1:29:58] in the dirt for a while.
[1:30:01] Show me that you really mean it.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; You ruined and you spent your entire
[1:30:06] substance
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; down there on all this harlotry and
[1:30:09] riotous living. And I want to see the
[1:30:13] proof that you are that you are really
[1:30:16] repenting.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; No, there was none of that.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Let us rejoice.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; My son has come home.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; That's the father's heart. That's Jesus
[1:30:29] teaching.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; That may not be what your preacher
[1:30:33] teaches or someone else tells you, but
[1:30:35] that's Jesus teaching.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; I love Jesus teaching.
[1:30:41] [Applause]
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; You made your mistake. Remember this.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; The father had been looking for you.
[1:30:50] [Applause]
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; No one else but the father was looking
[1:30:56] for you.
[1:30:58] Amen.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; I have to I have to pull myself back.
[1:31:01] I'll be preaching on it. It's been
[1:31:03] burning on my heart. Your elder son, the
[1:31:06] elder son
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; who never did anything wrong.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Always paid his tithe, always came to
[1:31:12] church, always worked real hard, lived a
[1:31:15] clean, pristine life. He wasn't looking
[1:31:18] for him.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; And when he came back, he didn't even
[1:31:21] understand the rejoicing.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; It was foreign to him. But if you're
[1:31:26] away from God, come home.
[1:31:29] [Applause]
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Come back to Father's house.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Father's looking for you.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Father's waiting for you.
[1:31:41] [Music]
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; We're waiting to have a feast.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; We're waiting to rejoice over your
[1:31:53] coming.
[1:31:56] [Music]
[1:31:58] [Applause]
[1:32:04] Peter didn't learn that verse from
[1:32:07] anybody.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; His father and mother never taught him
[1:32:10] and the rabbi never taught him.
[1:32:14] No teacher ever taught him. He never
[1:32:16] heard it before.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:20] But something inside,
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; the same thing that was driving Abel out
[1:32:25] to the field to get a lamb, the same
[1:32:28] thing was urging Peter to say, "Thou art
[1:32:32] the Christ,
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; the son of the living God,
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; he said, "Upon this rock,
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; I'll build my church."
[1:32:48] I took some of the messages
[1:32:52] that the prophet of God spoke in this
[1:32:54] time.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; I just want you now to know here's the
[1:33:00] vindicated vessel.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; And it's almost every service.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Supernatural.
[1:33:08] You might be sorry you even came to this
[1:33:10] service. I'm going to come right to your
[1:33:13] address
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; and put you on notice.
[1:33:17] And if you haven't heard these,
[1:33:22] he preaches.
[1:33:25] He says, "Who do you say
[1:33:28] this is?"
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Not just a whole group of who do you say
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; this is?
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Who do you say I am?
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Is there entire services?
[1:33:45] Who do you say
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; I am? Not the church, but you.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Who do you say this is?
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Identify it. Say it. Speak it.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Hear his voice.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; When their eyes were opened.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Who is this?
[1:34:16] Who is this Melzdc?
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; There's a man here that can turn on the
[1:34:23] light.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; And he did.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Not the little Kuckian, but the God that
[1:34:30] was in him.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Looking beyond the suit, looking beyond
[1:34:35] the grammar. Looking beyond the man and
[1:34:38] seeing the who he is revealing.
[1:34:42] none other than Jesus Christ
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; in this day.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; And when you can recognize that and it
[1:34:49] becomes a light and a power within you,
[1:34:51] a force, a passion,
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; that's when Jesus Christ can lay his
[1:34:57] hand upon you and shape you to be built
[1:35:00] into his church.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; That's the church.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:35:09] Yeah.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; A greater than Solomon is here.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Not a title.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; A declaration.
[1:35:16] [Applause]
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you that one that's
[1:35:22] greater than Solomon isn't back there 40
[1:35:24] years is here.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Same one is here.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Waiting for your response. Waiting to
[1:35:30] see if something is ignited
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; within your own soul.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Say, I can say that. I know who it is.
[1:35:39] I've heard the voice.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; I don't say it because the preacher
[1:35:44] wants me to say it. I don't want to say
[1:35:46] it because it sounds right. I want to
[1:35:48] say it because it's a reality.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; The unveiling of God.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; It is I.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Be not afraid.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:09] And last,
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; do you now believe
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; I just took a little selection?
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; You ought to read all the titles
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; of the messages.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Do you now believe?
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Who do you say this is?
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Do you know who was preaching those
[1:36:31] services? You know where those titles
[1:36:33] come from? They didn't come from the
[1:36:35] school in Kentucky. That's right.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; They came from the divine
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; mind of God
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; to say this
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; presented in this day. Who do you say I
[1:36:47] am?
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; And this is where the flesh and the
[1:36:51] people get confused. And some say, well,
[1:36:53] you're leaning towards deity. Not a bit.
[1:36:56] I'm seeing that it's deity in him and
[1:36:58] deity in you.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; How can you make it any different? Amen.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; That one that was being revealed is none
[1:37:08] other than the Christ.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; And when that becomes a reality to you
[1:37:14] and you can't say anything else, you
[1:37:16] can't believe anything else, then you
[1:37:18] are uh uh you're a potential.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; To be built
[1:37:24] and that's who Jesus was talking about.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Nothing else in this world. A lot of my
[1:37:33] life has passed, but nothing else in
[1:37:35] this world means anything to me than to
[1:37:38] have a witness as the Lord Jesus. That
[1:37:41] spirit that was in in that body.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Let it witness in my heart.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; You're you are my church.
[1:37:51] You're part of my church.
[1:37:53] I put my hand on you.
[1:37:56] Brother Ben talks about a master
[1:37:59] stonemason
[1:38:01] and and and that decisions are just a
[1:38:04] pile of rocks
[1:38:06] and those rocks have to be shaped.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; You can say, "I believe in the Lord
[1:38:10] Jesus Christ." That's fine. That's just
[1:38:12] a bare starting spot. And that's when
[1:38:14] God begins to shape you.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Into the kingdom of God.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Are we all right? Amen.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; And Satan knows well that the revelation
[1:38:25] of Jesus Christ.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; He knows well and that's what he tries
[1:38:31] to prevent because he knows it will
[1:38:34] prevail against his kingdom.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; He talks about and I won't go into it. I
[1:38:41] have the quotes here and all but he
[1:38:42] talks about how the priest he learned he
[1:38:46] learned that it was right. And for those
[1:38:48] you
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; uh young people especially,
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; you know, you are in a certain mode
[1:38:59] of learning. You go to school
[1:39:02] and you learn things
[1:39:05] and you're at home and you learn things.
[1:39:08] How do I do that? And your mother, your
[1:39:11] father teaches you this is how you do
[1:39:14] it. Oh, okay. Let me try.
[1:39:18] And we we we are in in this generation
[1:39:21] which is a highly educated generation.
[1:39:24] We learn things
[1:39:28] and we come to church and we learn
[1:39:30] things. We learn songs.
[1:39:33] We learn to sing. We learn the
[1:39:36] scriptures.
[1:39:38] We learn things. And we carry that same
[1:39:42] format into the church.
[1:39:44] A revelation is not learned.
[1:39:48] [Applause]
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; It's not something you learn. If you if
[1:39:52] you learn it, then someone else can
[1:39:54] teach you something different
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; and you can be talked out of it.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; But a revelation becomes actually part
[1:40:00] of you
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; as much as your entire being. It becomes
[1:40:04] a part of you. No one can ever argue you
[1:40:06] out of it.
[1:40:08] [Music]
[1:40:21] Now just stay real close for next few
[1:40:24] moments.
[1:40:27] Brother Brandon said in the message
[1:40:29] there is a man here that can turn on a
[1:40:30] light. He said when you see his word
[1:40:32] being vindicated
[1:40:35] or other words made known or in other
[1:40:38] words made known proved that it is the
[1:40:42] light of his spoken word
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; and without light nothing can live
[1:40:46] without light. There is no life upon the
[1:40:49] earth today but what has come by the
[1:40:52] light of the sun.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; And are you interested in eternal life?
[1:40:57] Amen.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; There is no eternal life outside of the
[1:41:00] son of God.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; He is the light.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Well, we know that as phrase. We know
[1:41:05] that as is being written in the word of
[1:41:07] God. That's not what I'm speaking about.
[1:41:09] I'm speaking about experimentally that
[1:41:12] you have experienced it.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; You actually experienced it. And so God
[1:41:21] confirms his word by manifesting. Now
[1:41:27] follow me if you can please because I
[1:41:31] didn't know just how to convey this to
[1:41:33] you. But God's word is not mere
[1:41:36] languages.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; It's not just phonics.
[1:41:42] What what what brought the revelation to
[1:41:45] Abel? I don't know. But then when Moses
[1:41:48] began to speak, he said, "I'll speak
[1:41:50] through a prophet." When Moses began to
[1:41:52] speak the word, Moses did not speak our
[1:41:55] language. I'm not too sure
[1:41:59] how. And the prophets maybe lived in
[1:42:02] different areas and spoke differently
[1:42:04] and their languages was different, but
[1:42:07] God was saying the same thing.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; God was still saying exactly the same
[1:42:14] thing. Amen.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said in the masterpiece
[1:42:19] that he cannot change his method.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; He refers to Malachi 3, I'm God, I
[1:42:25] change not. He cannot change his method.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; When he started after the fall of the
[1:42:33] masterpiece, he started to rebuild his
[1:42:37] uh rebuild the masterpiece. Follow me
[1:42:41] very close. I'm got a ways to go yet.
[1:42:44] And so he starts with Abraham. What's he
[1:42:46] do? He makes himself known to Abraham.
[1:42:49] What language says, "And God appeared to
[1:42:51] him." What did he say? How did he say
[1:42:53] it? I don't know. Do you know?
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; I don't think anybody here knows. But
[1:42:59] you know, Abraham got the same message.
[1:43:03] He got the message.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Whatever language, whatever sound or
[1:43:07] whatever he saw, he got the message that
[1:43:10] this is God speaking. Hallelujah.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; God was speaking to him.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; And he got a specific message. I'm going
[1:43:22] to give you this land.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you seed.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you a son.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Those are very specific things, aren't
[1:43:31] they?
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; He didn't say it in my language. Didn't
[1:43:34] say it in your language. I don't know
[1:43:36] how he said it. So, this is what I want
[1:43:39] to convey to you. It's essential to
[1:43:41] convey it to you. It may not be any
[1:43:43] specific language. God spoke to me. I
[1:43:46] don't know how he speaks to an
[1:43:47] individual, but when God speaks, it will
[1:43:50] surely bring a person into a righteous,
[1:43:52] holy condition.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; God makes his word known. This is how
[1:44:03] God makes his and he doesn't change his
[1:44:05] method. God makes his word known
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; by supernatural vindication and by
[1:44:11] manifest manifesting it or proving that
[1:44:14] it is his word. That's his method
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; and that's what he did in our generation
[1:44:21] and that's the word that you believe.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; You may have to believe it for years
[1:44:26] yet. I don't know. We may have the
[1:44:28] rapture before today is out. I don't
[1:44:31] know. But people have hung on and
[1:44:33] believed that since uh since the time of
[1:44:36] Jesus Christ when they identified who he
[1:44:39] was and this is this is the method
[1:44:41] friends.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus said flesh and blood has not
[1:44:47] revealed it to you. And that's the
[1:44:49] method
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; when it's revealed to you.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; And there's so much that's going on.
[1:44:55] Revelation is an overworked word
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; amongst believers.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Why do you say that? How
[1:45:02] do you know that?" Well, I'll tell you
[1:45:04] why. Because I see people drift from it.
[1:45:07] And you can get to say, "Here's
[1:45:08] precisely what the message says. Here's
[1:45:11] precisely what it says." Doesn't mean
[1:45:13] anything to them.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Now, I come with a real hard one.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Are they in the church?
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Are they in the church?
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Here's what the vindicated prophet of
[1:45:29] God said. Here's what it is. Doesn't
[1:45:31] mean anything to them.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; I have another feeling. I have another
[1:45:35] this.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, I can sing the same songs and and
[1:45:42] worship and pray and all that doesn't
[1:45:45] mean anything to me.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; All kinds of people pray.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; I can guarantee them. Most of the people
[1:45:51] in the message, none that I know of, go
[1:45:53] to the church every morning and pray
[1:45:56] specifically that I might enter into the
[1:45:58] kingdom. Right?
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; That's a sincere person.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; You know how long he's been doing it?
[1:46:04] Years and years.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Does he tire of it? No, he doesn't tire
[1:46:10] because he wants to enter the kingdom.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; And I ache in my heart. I pray I I trust
[1:46:18] that God somehow some way would bring
[1:46:22] him to a place where uh the there' just
[1:46:25] be a light turned on within him.
[1:46:28] Hallelujah.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Here's what God spoke through Moses.
[1:46:46] But the prophet which shall presume to
[1:46:48] speak a word in my name or the preacher
[1:46:53] which I have not commanded him to speak
[1:46:55] or that shall speak in the name of other
[1:46:58] gods even that prophet shall die.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; And if thou say in thine heart, how
[1:47:04] shall we know the word which the Lord
[1:47:08] hath not spoken?
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; How shall we know? How will you know the
[1:47:15] word that the Lord hath not spoken?
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. When a prophet speaketh in the
[1:47:22] name of the Lord, if the thing follow
[1:47:25] not,
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; if it's not vindicated,
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; if it's not proven,
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; if it's not correct,
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; and nor it come to pass, that thing
[1:47:36] which the Lord hath not spoken, but the
[1:47:39] prophet hath spoken presumptuously,
[1:47:42] thou shalt not be afraid of him.
[1:47:45] [Applause]
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I tell my brother, my
[1:47:49] sister, the message has become more
[1:47:51] important to me at in in this stage of
[1:47:53] my life than at any other time if he
[1:47:56] hasn't spoken it. It's not a proven
[1:47:58] vindicated word. I don't fear it.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; I just don't fear it.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; We're going to do this or we're going to
[1:48:05] do that or I'm going to go here or I'm
[1:48:07] going to go I got a plan. You go ahead
[1:48:09] with your plan.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, you anchor
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. You anchor your entire being
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; in what is thus saith the Lord.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; I was really I was really touched last
[1:48:23] night. Brother Mark, why I don't see him
[1:48:25] here this morning. Maybe he's on a
[1:48:26] camera someplace. Yeah, you're there.
[1:48:31] And he said he was required by because
[1:48:34] of his management position I guess he
[1:48:36] was required to read and study this
[1:48:40] volume this book on management and
[1:48:43] leadership. Many of you weren't there
[1:48:45] last night so you can hear this for the
[1:48:48] first time. And there was 22 things that
[1:48:52] were are are guides and requirements for
[1:48:56] a person to become really in leadership.
[1:49:02] And he says he had to study. He was
[1:49:04] required to study all of those things.
[1:49:08] And when he was finished, he said it was
[1:49:10] really intense. And when he was done, he
[1:49:15] read the message leadership. And I
[1:49:17] appreciate the kind of uh
[1:49:21] mental ability that he would have. And
[1:49:24] he took the message leadership and read
[1:49:26] it and said every one of those 21 or 22
[1:49:31] items are included in the message
[1:49:34] leadership.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; All of those qualities are there. All of
[1:49:37] those instructions are there. Isn't it
[1:49:39] incredible? And listen, if you read
[1:49:41] that, if you read that and let the Holy
[1:49:43] Spirit make it a reality to you'll get
[1:49:45] every quality you need for leadership.
[1:49:48] [Music]
[1:49:58] Brother Brandham talks about
[1:50:02] I just want to mention this one who is
[1:50:06] doing the building.
[1:50:08] No man hath seen God at any time. The
[1:50:11] only begotten son which is in the bosom
[1:50:13] of the father. Notice he was standing on
[1:50:15] earth when he said who was in the bosom
[1:50:18] of the father. He hath declared him. In
[1:50:21] other words, he has made him known.
[1:50:25] Brother said so he was first God Jehovah
[1:50:29] and out of him he said let's see uh
[1:50:33] coming out of space where there's
[1:50:35] nothing. Let's make a little white
[1:50:38] light, like a mystic light, like a halo.
[1:50:41] And that was the logos that went out of
[1:50:44] God in the beginning. That was the son
[1:50:48] of God that came out of the bosom of the
[1:50:51] father. That was what was in the
[1:50:54] beginning was the word. Now, he's going
[1:50:57] back and just giving us a a little
[1:50:59] description. That's what it was. In the
[1:51:02] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:51:03] with God. Well, he just describes it and
[1:51:06] gives it in a in in a in a drama form
[1:51:09] and a little white mystic light comes
[1:51:12] out and he said that is the logos.
[1:51:15] That's the word proceeding out of the
[1:51:18] bosom of the father.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; And he said we'll call it the son of
[1:51:23] God.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Do I have just a few more minutes?
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Because this becomes actually I'm
[1:51:37] actually coming to the part that is so
[1:51:41] important to me.
[1:51:49] I believe
[1:51:52] that God raised up
[1:51:55] the messenger of this day.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you notice now
[1:52:01] I just pray that God will help me to
[1:52:02] make this and I'll conclude on this part
[1:52:06] even though I'm not finished.
[1:52:09] I saw him now because of the message and
[1:52:11] the way God was dealing with me. I saw
[1:52:13] now
[1:52:15] this one we call the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:52:17] as the builder
[1:52:19] and according to his own words coming
[1:52:21] out of his own mouth. When you see the
[1:52:24] days of Sodom again, which we see. When
[1:52:26] you see the days of Lot, when you see
[1:52:28] the days of Noah again, that's when I
[1:52:31] will be revealed.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30. And we know that God raised
[1:52:37] up this prophet messenger and through
[1:52:39] him revealed.
[1:52:41] Now he's coming.
[1:52:44] And I I see now it's not just Willie
[1:52:46] Brham, not him in that in his physical
[1:52:50] form, but I see that that he's been
[1:52:54] chosen and gifted and given this office.
[1:52:58] And it's the Lord Jesus Christ. And he
[1:53:01] says
[1:53:03] the angel of the Lord speaking to him if
[1:53:05] they don't believe the first
[1:53:08] the first sign I'll make them to believe
[1:53:11] the second for I'll make you to know the
[1:53:13] secret of their heart.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; So now I want to come to that part
[1:53:18] because now the one hang in here the one
[1:53:22] that he is actually going to make known
[1:53:24] to the people is the builder.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the one who said, "I
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah."
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; That's the I
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; I will build my church.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; So now he's coming to a whole masses of
[1:53:38] people who don't really know who he is.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; And so now he begins to tell them that
[1:53:45] it's a light. It's the same pillar of
[1:53:48] fire. And he's explaining it to the
[1:53:50] people. He says, "It's over this man.
[1:53:52] It's over this woman." And he begins to
[1:53:55] reveal the secret of their heart. But
[1:53:57] many many many many times he says this
[1:54:01] now follow me.
[1:54:03] Said I
[1:54:05] take every spirit
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; in this building
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; under my control
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; for the glory of God.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; And you know it's well taught in the
[1:54:17] message every that your spirit has the
[1:54:21] five channels.
[1:54:23] And you have the memory.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; that channel can be so
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; such a disappointment.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; And the conscience
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; where the guilt and all the condemnation
[1:54:38] can be
[1:54:40] and the ma and the memory and the
[1:54:42] conscience and the imagination
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; and the reasoning
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; and all of these and the affections.
[1:54:51] I don't know. I can't. I don't think I
[1:54:54] have the time.
[1:54:56] But isn't it incredible
[1:54:58] that God positioned a man says, "I take
[1:55:04] every spirit
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; under my control."
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; For the glory of God.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; He took control of the affections.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; He took control of the memory. Took
[1:55:19] control of those for the glory of God.
[1:55:21] And I can tell you when when the heart
[1:55:23] of the secret of the heart begin to be
[1:55:24] unveiled of the people, they didn't have
[1:55:26] anything in their mind. They come there,
[1:55:28] they needed something desperately. And
[1:55:30] God was on the scene making him known.
[1:55:32] In other words, God, that's how he began
[1:55:35] to approach the building stones.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; And there was multitudes that could say,
[1:55:40] "Hosana, hosana. Oh, this is like Bible
[1:55:43] days again. This is glorious again." But
[1:55:46] when the word came and he began to tell
[1:55:48] them who he is, there wasn't very many
[1:55:51] saying thou art the Christ,
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; the son of the living God.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; This is the Messiah. And even told him,
[1:56:00] this is the sign of the Messiah. This is
[1:56:02] the last great sign. Are you folks
[1:56:04] following me?
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; That's how close. And that, you know,
[1:56:11] it was just that fine line
[1:56:14] that they weren't able to
[1:56:16] grasp.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; But he it was it was the same. It was
[1:56:21] the builder and he was approaching the
[1:56:24] stones. Heaps of stones.
[1:56:27] Heaps of stones. Baptist stones,
[1:56:30] Presbyterian stones, Pentecostal stones,
[1:56:33] Jehovah's Witnesses, the whole works of
[1:56:35] them. all these stones out there and
[1:56:38] just one here, one there caught it.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; This is God's prophet
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; and begin to listen and begin to see and
[1:56:48] saw the vindication, the vindication,
[1:56:51] the proof
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; that this was correct.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; That to me means so much. Friends, if
[1:56:59] this were my last message, this is what
[1:57:00] I would want to scream out. That
[1:57:02] vindication is what I have my confidence
[1:57:05] in
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; because that's God. That's not a man.
[1:57:09] That's not a church. It's not a Bible
[1:57:11] school.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; It's not a theology.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; You can argue about he said, she said,
[1:57:17] they said, he did. They did. You can
[1:57:20] argue that till you're blew in the face.
[1:57:22] You can't argue.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; When you say you had an operation,
[1:57:26] you're in the hospital last week. You
[1:57:29] had an operation. You have cancer. There
[1:57:32] cancer in the prostate.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Sister, you have cancer. It's on the
[1:57:37] breast. It's on your right breast.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; Another one.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; You've had an operation. You've had two.
[1:57:45] You've had three, four, five. Oh, that
[1:57:50] poor woman.
[1:57:53] And they couldn't find it.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; That's real diagnosis. Hallelujah.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; That's going way beyond the doctors.
[1:58:04] Five operations and they couldn't find
[1:58:06] it.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; What wisdom is this that can find it?
[1:58:11] [Applause]
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Just a moment.
[1:58:16] The devil is trying to hide. Oh,
[1:58:21] be real reverent. Scanning the
[1:58:23] congregation. Oh, there it is.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Epilepsy.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; That's a hard one to handle. You you can
[1:58:31] hide from the doctors, but you can't
[1:58:33] hide from God.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Where was God?
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; In the man.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Was it right? Was it true? I say yes, it
[1:58:45] was true.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; That's the builder.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Not William Brandon, the Christ that was
[1:58:53] being revealed in this day. The one the
[1:58:57] person of the message
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; is the builder.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; And if anybody denies
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; the message,
[1:59:08] I don't have any confidence that they
[1:59:10] form part
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; of his church.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; It's a group
[1:59:17] people. Brother Bam called them clubs.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Friends, I don't want to be in a club.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've got to know, brother John.
[1:59:27] I'm in the church.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; There's only one church.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Take every spirit under my control.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; He says, "And this gift is to contact
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; your spirit."
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "You realize we're dealing with
[1:59:51] spiritual beings." said, "You have a
[1:59:54] spirit."
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Every person in this building,
[1:59:59] regardless of what age you are, you have
[2:00:00] a spirit,
[2:00:02] a human spirit that entered your body
[2:00:06] when you took your first breath.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; And you have a man
[2:00:13] in a suit like I'm dressed this
[2:00:15] afternoon.
[2:00:17] A man,
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; I take control of your spirit. I take
[2:00:22] control of every spirit
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; in this building for the glory of God.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Your affections, your emotions, your
[2:00:31] every part of you. I take control of it.
[2:00:33] He didn't say, "I take control of your
[2:00:35] soul."
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Because he was only seeking it was the
[2:00:39] builder
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; trying to get you to bite on the hook.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; So that he could bring you in
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; and start working on you by the word of
[2:00:49] God. and build you into his church.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I can say with the children
[2:00:59] that sing the chorus, he's still working
[2:01:00] on me.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Why don't we all say that? He's still
[2:01:08] working on me.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Now, we should say, "Praise the Lord."
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he's still working on me.
[2:01:14] [Applause]
[2:01:17] God.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; And uh I'm I'm closing with this, but
[2:01:25] this is so priceless.
[2:01:28] He said
[2:01:30] when that and he's talking about taking
[2:01:32] people taking the spirit under control.
[2:01:36] He said when I when the blood cell when
[2:01:40] the blood cell at Calvary broke
[2:01:43] and he says when that blood cell broke
[2:01:45] at Calvary not only the life of the
[2:01:48] human being came back
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; but the life of God comes back
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; from it and makes you a son and daughter
[2:01:57] of God. He said in he he he he said
[2:02:00] another place
[2:02:03] he said that God making himself tearing
[2:02:06] out or rooting out all of the evil
[2:02:08] bringing into submission the flesh the
[2:02:11] dust that he created and live with you
[2:02:14] as a partner.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Oh I love that. He says then the blood
[2:02:18] cell was broken on Calvary. Not was not
[2:02:22] an animal neither was it a man. It was
[2:02:25] God's own blood. Do you believe that?
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; And it comes back and gives a new birth.
[2:02:32] He said that spirit
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; that spirit that comes out of there
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; comes into the human spirit
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; and makes him a son or daughter of God.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; I can I will say the blood cell has been
[2:02:52] broken. Yeah,
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; the blood cell at Calvary has been
[2:02:57] broken.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; The spirit
[2:03:00] came out from there.
[2:03:03] That is the Holy Spirit of God.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; And he said it comes into the human
[2:03:07] spirit.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; And makes you a son or daughter of God.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you just to think now
[2:03:18] as we close
[2:03:20] according to this teaching.
[2:03:24] I have a spirit.
[2:03:26] I have a human spirit.
[2:03:29] But I have believed
[2:03:32] I trust you can con confess and say that
[2:03:35] along with me. I have believed
[2:03:38] the word that God has sent.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; I have believed on him whom he has sent.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that word that I
[2:03:46] believed is none other than the Jesus
[2:03:50] Christ, the son of God.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; I believe it beyond my understanding.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; My dear friends, let the message
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; be your guide.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; It's Christ the person,
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; not a book.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Not just looking at a book for some
[2:04:11] answers. That's not it. looking to see
[2:04:13] another aspect of the person.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; This is the person.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; I'm your friend.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you the absolute truth.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; When I have a message book in my hand, I
[2:04:31] approach it
[2:04:35] that I might
[2:04:37] get what the author is trying to say to
[2:04:39] me. I don't look at brother Brandham as
[2:04:41] being the author. People
[2:04:44] talk about brother Brandham breaking the
[2:04:45] seals. Brother Brandham didn't break the
[2:04:46] seals. He spoke the bro open seals.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; But I see it as a person.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Not a book of brother Brandham said this
[2:04:56] and that because he said this that you
[2:04:58] have to do that. No, I want the person.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; He said it's a person.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:10] I want you to think deep.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "Who do men say that I
[2:05:15] am?"
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; And Peter finally said, "Thou art the
[2:05:19] Christ, the son." What son was he
[2:05:22] talking about?
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; He's not talking about the son that was
[2:05:25] born from Mary.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; You have to watch this close cuz that
[2:05:29] son died
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; and rose again
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; by the spirit that was in him.
[2:05:36] So he's talking about the son of God,
[2:05:38] the son he couldn't see.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; The son that was made real to him.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; That's the one I look for as I read the
[2:05:46] messages. And I admonish you. I
[2:05:48] encourage you when you read that and you
[2:05:51] take that and you listen to it, you say,
[2:05:53] "Son of God,
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; revealed in this time
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; you speak to me. Hallelujah.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; I can tell you
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; even in the last few months
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; the spirit
[2:06:11] of God
[2:06:13] has just so guided
[2:06:16] sometimes cautioned
[2:06:18] then instructed. I can't take you to the
[2:06:21] actual quote but I see I I I'll maybe
[2:06:24] read a quote.
[2:06:26] Oh,
[2:06:28] and then
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; and then I I circle that then. Then this
[2:06:33] happened.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Now, friends,
[2:06:37] it it depends what you think this is
[2:06:40] today.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Depends who you think this is. I'm not
[2:06:43] interested in any other church than the
[2:06:45] church. I'm not interested in this
[2:06:47] church.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in this church. I'm
[2:06:50] interested in
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; a church of failure. People will fail
[2:06:56] you.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; But the church of Jesus Christ,
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; it will never fail you.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Built upon the church, built upon the
[2:07:08] rock.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; The declaration, the confession.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:07:21] That spirit, and I'm going to just
[2:07:24] repeat this in my closing comment, that
[2:07:26] spirit
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; that comes out of there,
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; which he said was a blood cell. That
[2:07:31] spirit that comes out of there, that
[2:07:35] blood cell comes into the human spirit
[2:07:38] and makes or creates him as a son or
[2:07:42] daughter of God.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. This was one of brother Brandham's
[2:07:49] great I'm not going to I'm not taking
[2:07:52] this off to speak a lot longer. I'm just
[2:07:55] taking it off to be more comfortable.
[2:07:59] You know I lived in the time I sat in
[2:08:01] the meetings and I heard brother
[2:08:03] Brandham preaching to the people.
[2:08:12] Listen to me real close. You couldn't
[2:08:15] convince those people that that they
[2:08:18] were not sons and daughters of God.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; You couldn't you couldn't convince them
[2:08:24] for anything.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; What do you mean? I'm a minister. I'm a
[2:08:29] preacher. I have a congregation. I have
[2:08:31] a successful church.
[2:08:34] And he had the ministers meetings one
[2:08:35] after the other after the other. And you
[2:08:37] ought to listen. Go ahead and listen to
[2:08:38] them on the tape. They're so quiet. You
[2:08:41] can cut the air with a knife.
[2:08:44] You go and listen to Godhead explained
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; several hundred ministers
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; and he's telling them I love it.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; He says he asked him a question. You
[2:08:55] should listen to it. He asked him a
[2:08:57] question. Now hang on to your seats.
[2:09:01] He said
[2:09:03] was God the father
[2:09:07] the father of Jesus Christ?
[2:09:10] And he is real quiet. He says, "Well,
[2:09:14] surely
[2:09:16] you know what you believe and you're not
[2:09:18] ashamed of what you believe." Was God
[2:09:21] the Father, the Father of Jesus Christ?
[2:09:25] See, they sensed that it was a trap.
[2:09:28] And it was.
[2:09:30] And then he asked him the second time,
[2:09:32] "Was God the Father the Father of Jesus
[2:09:35] Christ?" And you hear two or three
[2:09:37] little squeaks. Amen.
[2:09:41] You know why? Cuz they were they were
[2:09:42] afraid.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; He says, "All right, let's turn to
[2:09:46] Matthew the 2 chapter
[2:09:49] and begins to tell of the conception of
[2:09:51] Jesus Christ." And he was conceived of
[2:09:54] the Holy Ghost.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Wow. He said, "Now we have the second
[2:10:01] person conceiving the third person."
[2:10:06] And they were having a problem.
[2:10:09] Now, here I'm going to I I'm going to
[2:10:11] bring it really down home. Do you think
[2:10:13] that they could convince one of those
[2:10:15] men, ministers of successful churches,
[2:10:20] that they were not sons of God? I'm not
[2:10:23] saying they weren't sons of God. But
[2:10:25] when the word came, when the word was
[2:10:27] coming, they said, "We speak in tongues
[2:10:30] and we have all this demonstration, have
[2:10:32] healings,
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; have miracles, have all the
[2:10:36] manifestations,
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; but there's one thing that's lacking,
[2:10:40] and that is that God can unveil the
[2:10:42] secret of the heart, doesn't matter what
[2:10:44] it is, and say it time after time after
[2:10:47] time, and ask the people public, is that
[2:10:50] correct? Is that the truth?" And the
[2:10:52] people said, "It's the truth." Amen.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Not not just a healing, not just having
[2:10:56] faith for a certain thing to happen.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; I heard him just the other day and he's
[2:11:02] talking to a man and he said, "You're
[2:11:04] real nervous." And the reason you're
[2:11:06] nervous is you're you're a minister,
[2:11:08] aren't you? Yes, you're a minister. And
[2:11:10] the reason why you're nervous is you got
[2:11:12] to get out of here and go to a service.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; You got an appointment you have to go
[2:11:18] to.
[2:11:19] Just just relating everything. Is that
[2:11:22] true? Yeah, it's true.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; 30 years.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; Is that true? You say, "Brother Ed,
[2:11:27] we've heard you say that so many times."
[2:11:29] Is that true? That's what you have to
[2:11:31] anchor your faith in.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; It's the truth.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; We have the spirit of truth.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; The spirit of truth vindicated the word.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; And then when you hear that, when you
[2:11:44] see that and it begins to speak to you,
[2:11:46] say, "You are the Christ,
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; not the man." the man that was in the
[2:11:52] man,
[2:11:54] the son
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; of the living God,
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; not the one born from Mary.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Yet, that was the vessel that God was
[2:12:03] in.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; And it was Jesus Christ in in a special
[2:12:08] way because he said,
[2:12:10] "My flesh is meat indeed,
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; and my blood is drink indeed."
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham could never say that.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; This was Jesus Christ.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. born of a virgin and the blood was
[2:12:22] the blood of God.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; Not Jew, not Gentile, the blood of God.
[2:12:27] And God's blood was in his a new
[2:12:30] creation. And that blood cell of the new
[2:12:32] creation broke and the spirit uh uh
[2:12:35] departed from that body. And that holy
[2:12:38] spirit hovered over the earth to bring
[2:12:40] forth the sons and daughters of God. And
[2:12:43] when those those who were chosen and
[2:12:46] elected saw it, they said in each age,
[2:12:49] that's the son of God.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; That is the Messiah. That's a revealed
[2:12:54] word in our time.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; And I say to you,
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; blessed art thou.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; You're blessed
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; people. Amen.
[2:13:07] And when you've taken your last breath,
[2:13:09] and I've taken my last breath here,
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; we'll meet in another land,
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; in another place.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful?
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel like I'd like to just
[2:13:23] sing a little song.
[2:13:26] I need Brother Derek, can you help me?
[2:13:32] I'd like to sing a song that a native
[2:13:35] brother sang in Port El Bernie.
[2:13:38] And when he got finished singing it,
[2:13:41] Brother Brandham came out to the pulpit
[2:13:44] and he said
[2:13:46] wouldn't be much of a preacher. He
[2:13:48] couldn't preach after that.
[2:13:52] I tell you what,
[2:13:54] it's just glorious. Absolutely glorious.
[2:13:56] Oh, what a savior.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; What a savior. Would you stand with me
[2:14:00] and let's sing a verse or two of it?
[2:14:05] We have the words up, please.

[2:14:12] moment while we glorify him. Oh, what a
[2:14:15] savior.

[2:17:54] Hallelujah. Our
[2:17:57] precious Lord Jesus,
[2:18:01] thank you. How can we thank you? These
[2:18:03] words are so inadequate.
[2:18:07] But hear it in the language of our
[2:18:09] hearts, Lord.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; Hear it in the language that cannot be
[2:18:14] spoken in our tongue.
[2:18:17] Oh, we say with the minister, the
[2:18:19] songwriter, oh for a thousand tongues
[2:18:22] to declare our savior's praise.
[2:18:26] Lord, our souls, our souls, oh God, are
[2:18:29] lifted up to you in thanksgiving
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; and we cannot describe, but we ask you,
[2:18:37] Lord, to look within our hearts
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; and see that love and receive it, oh
[2:18:43] God. Let it be like a sweet incense
[2:18:45] before you.
[2:18:47] And I pray that the people here today,
[2:18:49] Lord, will not have sat in a Sunday
[2:18:51] morning service hearing a message or
[2:18:55] sermon. But may there be words of God
[2:18:58] spoken to them.
[2:19:01] Touch them. Lord,
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; touch each life. Lord, I'm thinking of
[2:19:06] different ones in the assembly. Oh,
[2:19:08] Father, speak to them.
[2:19:12] We've had a graduating class. Oh Lord
[2:19:14] Jesus, would you guide them? You said
[2:19:16] that the Holy Spirit will guide you into
[2:19:18] all truth. Guide them, oh God, guide
[2:19:20] them.
[2:19:22] And may they be man enough and woman
[2:19:24] enough to say you are my guide. I will
[2:19:26] not trust my own mind, my own wisdom. I
[2:19:29] will not trust
[2:19:31] any other one, but I'll trust you. You
[2:19:34] will guide their footsteps right. Oh
[2:19:37] God, make them a make them a real
[2:19:40] witness for you. We need witnesses. I
[2:19:42] pray Lord that this congregation of
[2:19:43] people will be a a powerful witness of
[2:19:46] Christ in this time, Lord Jesus. And as
[2:19:49] we spend a this afternoon and return
[2:19:52] this evening to hear our brother Bill
[2:19:55] Ivy, oh God, pastor of many years,

[2:20:04] Lord, I pray that you'll use his mouth.
[2:20:06] Speak to me. Speak to us, oh Lord. would
[2:20:08] say, "Speak my Lord and I will answer."
[2:20:11] Oh God,
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; you'll put words in his mouth for us.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; Bless us this afternoon, Lord. And as we
[2:20:20] depart this place, may we
[2:20:24] depart with the peace of God abiding
[2:20:26] upon us.
