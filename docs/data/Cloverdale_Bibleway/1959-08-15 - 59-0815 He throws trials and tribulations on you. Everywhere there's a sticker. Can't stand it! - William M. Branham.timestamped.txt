[0:00] he makes it nice for his little eaglets
[0:03] when they BN I'm so glad to be one of
[0:06] them and then after the little ones are
[0:09] born they got a nice little cozy bed to
[0:12] lay on and everything's just nice and
[0:14] going good then the first thing you know
[0:17] this mother eagle takes an ocean after
[0:19] she sees some feathers coming on to her
[0:21] Eagles her eaglets she takes an ocean
[0:24] and she's determined they're not going
[0:25] to be
[0:26] Earthbound you know God takes that too
[0:29] he don't want you to be all just bound
[0:30] down by the things of the world she
[0:33] takes the notion that she's not going to
[0:35] let her little eaglet become like
[0:37] chickens I'm glad that God does the same
[0:39] thing he don't want you chicken
[0:41] scavengers he wants you an eagle and so
[0:44] then she looks some all over good until
[0:47] she thinks that they got enough feathers
[0:49] on them so then she goes in the inside
[0:51] of the nest and she takes her big beak
[0:54] and pulls all of that rabbit skin and
[0:56] sheep skin out of there and throws it
[0:58] out and then every time those little
[1:00] Eagles start to sit down or step it's
[1:03] stickers and Thorns what's the matter
[1:06] she don't want them to get adjusted to
[1:09] the nest that's the way God does his
[1:11] church he throws trials and tribulations
[1:14] on you every son that cometh to God must
[1:17] be tried and chased of God he don't want
[1:20] you to get adjusted to this world maybe
[1:23] he throws you on a bed of sickness maybe
[1:25] let you have a heart trouble a sticker
[1:28] everywhere you turn there's a sticker
[1:31] the little fellas just can't stand it
[1:34] and sometimes they get all sore for
[1:36] every time they start to hunker down a
[1:38] sticker stick them oh everyone that's
[1:42] ever experienced the birth of an eagle
[1:46] yourself a't one of Jehovah's Eagles you
[1:48] know what I'm talking about trials and
[1:51] temptations almighty God taken his own
[1:54] son Into the Wilderness and turned the
[1:56] devil loose on him
