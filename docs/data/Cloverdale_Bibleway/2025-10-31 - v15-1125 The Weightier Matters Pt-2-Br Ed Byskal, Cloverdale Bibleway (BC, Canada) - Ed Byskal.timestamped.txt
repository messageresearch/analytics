[2:32] the last verse again. I just I was
[2:35] listening to the preach this afternoon
[2:36] and brother Bradam sang that at the end
[2:38] and of course he focused on this verse.

[2:42] that's why we're here. Amen. We're
[2:45] looking forward to the lamb stepping
[2:46] forth and claiming his own. Amen.

[5:16] anywhere.
[5:23] Lord,
[5:26] bright morning
[5:32] and
[5:34] eternity.
[5:38] I'm going to praise him
[5:43] and forever
[5:46] more
[5:48] I will reign with him.
[5:53] &gt;&gt; While the music continually plays, just
[5:56] going to ask brother John Andy's to come
[5:58] and lead us to the throne of grace. And
[6:00] we have a testimony here tonight.
[6:02] Brother Rob Red Path writes in that he'd
[6:05] like to thank us for our prayers for the
[6:07] congregation and the saints. U his
[6:10] employer has called him back to work. So
[6:12] we just want to give thanks to the Lord
[6:14] for that. God is supplying his needs.
[6:16] Amen.
[6:17] We're so happy that God is the great I
[6:20] am and he's very aware of what we have
[6:22] need of present help in the time of
[6:25] need. Would you come, brother John,
[6:26] please?
[6:31] Let's just lift our hearts up in praise.
[6:33] If you'd like to lift your hand, he sees
[6:35] thanksgiving.
[6:37] Heavenly Father, we just love you
[6:39] tonight. We're such under anticipation
[6:43] since Sunday even to come here tonight
[6:45] and hear the word of God.
[6:48] Say, and confess publicly that we
[6:50] believe. So much unbelief and darkness
[6:54] in this land, but you've given us a
[6:56] heart to believe. We're not struggling
[6:59] or confused. You've turned on the light,
[7:02] Lord. I pray tonight you'd shine on a
[7:05] great light even further. Take us
[7:07] deeper. Take us, Lord. Even uh it's not
[7:10] just the bread and the and the loaves
[7:13] and fishes that we have been turned to
[7:15] you. It's not the miracles and signs and
[7:18] wonders. It's the word of God that's
[7:21] tugged on our souls and have kept kept
[7:24] us over the years in the good times and
[7:27] the bad times. We're just here to give
[7:29] you glory tonight. As we've heard over
[7:31] the years, it's we're not going to make
[7:33] it in by the skin of our teeth. We
[7:35] believe we're going in in waves of
[7:37] glory. There might be a lot of things
[7:40] happening in the body or in the spirit,
[7:42] but our souls are hanging on to thus
[7:45] sayeth the Lord. Hallelujah. strengthen
[7:49] the bride tonight, Lord. May the
[7:51] carcass, Lord, may the eagles tonight,
[7:53] from the youngest to the oldest, just
[7:56] learn as we've been trained to feed on
[7:59] the body word of the son of man. For
[8:02] you've come in this hour revealing
[8:03] yourself, revealing who we are,
[8:06] revealing our healer, our provider. We
[8:09] want to thank you with our brother Rob
[8:11] that you provided, Lord.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; You provided for all of us, Lord. When
[8:16] we make it on the other side, we're
[8:18] going to look back and you have cared
[8:20] for us just fine over the years. We are
[8:23] going to make it by the grace of God.
[8:26] Tonight's a refreshment. We've already
[8:28] sent your spirit here. We want to lay
[8:30] aside our busy lives, our schedules.
[8:34] The hassle that might be in our spirits
[8:37] or some distraction. We just lay it all
[8:40] down right now at your feet, Jesus. For
[8:42] in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
[8:45] when these bodies are going to be
[8:47] changed, nothing down here is really
[8:49] going to matter anymore. Father, let us
[8:52] come up into that other dimension and
[8:54] just begin to pull and exercise our
[8:56] faith. Lord, there's needs, hands are
[8:59] lifted up, Lord. Some in pray, some in
[9:02] with needs in their lives that we're
[9:04] asking you to come tonight and minister.
[9:07] You know the thoughts and intents of our
[9:09] hearts. May the sharp two-edged sword
[9:12] come down into that soul of ours, Lord.
[9:15] Maybe somebody could drop their water
[9:17] pot tonight and say, "I'm healed. I'm
[9:19] delivered. It's over." God's put driven
[9:22] down a stake in my life and I'm claiming
[9:25] that right till the body change. Lord,
[9:28] we love you tonight. Strengthen all of
[9:30] us. We're just a family in this
[9:32] Thanksgiving time and we're here to give
[9:33] you glory. Bless our pastor. Strengthen
[9:36] him. May he mount up with wings like an
[9:39] eagle. And may the eagle anointing come
[9:41] through this building tonight and
[9:43] minister to each one of our hearts.
[9:45] Lord, we're hungry to see the third pull
[9:47] in action. We are thirsty, Lord, more
[9:50] and more to see the opening of the word,
[9:52] Jesus. This is not a Wednesday night
[9:55] service. This is a time for the burden
[9:57] of the word of the Lord to be put onto
[10:00] our hearts, onto our shoulders, God. We
[10:03] want to take these weightier manners,
[10:05] Lord, and we don't want to go back to
[10:07] where we used to be. But this is a time
[10:09] for the change. Greater things are right
[10:12] here among us. May we grab a hold of it
[10:15] like real mature eagles and drink from
[10:18] this body word. Lord, bless every part
[10:20] of the service and for answering our
[10:22] prayers. We give you glory. We give you
[10:25] thanksgiving. We give you first place in
[10:28] our lives in Jesus Christ's name. We
[10:31] thank you, Lord.
[10:32] Amen.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; Have your seats.
[10:42] Just feel a great anticipation here
[10:44] tonight. And we're looking forward to
[10:46] our pastor speaking to us again carrying
[10:49] on from Sunday and looking forward to
[10:52] the word. And I've been wanting to sing
[10:54] this song together. and we'll invite
[10:57] Brother Ed to come on out and break thou
[11:01] the bread of life.
[11:06] We're going to feed on the bread of
[11:07] life. Amen. We are feeding. Amen.
[11:11] Break thou the bread of life,
[11:17] dear Lord, to me.
[11:23] As thou did it break the bread beside
[11:30] the sea.
[11:35] Beyond
[11:37] the sage
[11:41] I seek thee, Lord.
[11:46] My
[11:48] spirit pass for thee. Holy
[11:55] word.
[11:57] All right. All right. Let's try verse
[12:00] two.
[12:02] Pray bless
[12:04] thou the truth dear Lord
[12:09] to me to me
[12:15] as thou did bless the bread by ge
[12:27] shall all bond
[12:32] All feeders fall
[12:37] and I shall find my peace, my all
[12:45] in all.
[12:49] Teach me to live, dear, Lord,
[12:55] only
[12:56] for thee.
[13:00] as side by side
[13:05] in G.
[13:12] All my struggles
[13:17] then victory won.
[13:23] I shall be holy, Lord, the living
[13:31] one.
[13:34] I have to apologize to the musicians. I
[13:38] make them sweat sometimes and I choose
[13:40] some songs we're not we don't sing too
[13:42] often. So, I I do apologize. Trust
[13:46] you'll forgive me. Let's all stand
[13:48] together and sing fill my cup Lord as
[13:51] our pastor would come.
[13:54] Fill my cup
[13:58] Lord.
[14:00] I
[14:08] come away
[14:12] this mercy
[14:14] on my soul.
[14:20] Great heaven.
[14:27] I want no
[14:38] and
[14:42] one more time.
[14:44] Oh my
[14:50] I
[14:57] kind
[15:03] of my soul
[15:09] They are
[15:15] still I want
[15:22] my
[15:29] home.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[15:34] I'm confident he'll do that.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. If I'll just turn my power on, I'm
[15:39] sure he'll turn the power on.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; Do we have power? Good. Good.
[15:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, this is a Wednesday night
[15:48] and uh we're in great expectation. If
[15:51] you you read some of the things I've
[15:54] read, uh I said there's enough to make
[15:57] the an atheist a believer. Hallelujah.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; I had to I had to even read I just had
[16:04] to read one or two things to the
[16:06] brothers in the study before we came out
[16:08] and it was wonderful, wasn't it? Yeah.
[16:10] Amen. Amen. I want to before we turn to
[16:14] a scripture, uh God bless you, brother
[16:17] Gary.
[16:19] Thinking about you today. Amen.
[16:22] Uh, I want to turn to a scripture, but
[16:24] before I do, I'd like to sing many
[16:26] things about tomorrow
[16:29] because that's from my heart. I don't
[16:31] seem to understand, but I know who holds
[16:34] tomorrow.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; And yet, I know he holds my hand. And
[16:37] that's what's important. Can you sing
[16:39] that from the depths of your heart? Help
[16:41] us out, brother Nathan.
[16:48] about tomorrow.
[16:52] I don't see
[17:05] Oh,
[17:07] and I know
[17:11] you
[17:35] Oh,
[17:38] and I love
[17:42] you. Hold my hand
[17:46] and the people can say amen.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we thank you for the
[17:51] songs that have been sung and the
[17:54] prayers have have been prayed and the
[17:57] people have journeyed to the service. We
[18:00] pray now you will meet us. You're the
[18:01] supernatural God and anything you do is
[18:04] supernatural. We hear the testimonies
[18:07] from afar. We hear the testimonies that
[18:10] are near. We hear the testimonies, oh
[18:13] God, that you did long ago and you're
[18:16] still doing today because you're the
[18:18] same yesterday, today, and forever by
[18:20] the Holy Spirit. Inspire faith from your
[18:23] word now in Jesus Christ's name. Anoint
[18:27] us for service. We pray. Amen. Amen.
[18:32] I'll have you turn in your Bibles. I'm
[18:34] going to be continuing on with the
[18:37] burden of the word uh part two. But uh
[18:42] uh the service tonight will be perhaps
[18:46] quite different in that uh I want to
[18:48] raise a few questions because questions
[18:51] causes a person to ponder
[18:55] and when you ponder it opens up your
[18:58] heart and mind to the Holy Spirit to
[19:02] begin to you know just you'll feel it
[19:04] just churning and then things that were
[19:07] clouded become clearer
[19:09] &gt;&gt; and it will cause you to it'll cause you
[19:12] to think about uh I want you to think
[19:14] about God himself because uh th this is
[19:19] a this is a supernatural gospel and we
[19:22] can't be worshiping God and not know who
[19:24] he is
[19:26] &gt;&gt; uh and we desire a clearer understanding
[19:29] of him when we approach him. We want to
[19:32] be able to know that uh he's accepting
[19:36] us and receiving us. So I'm going to
[19:39] read uh Malachi
[19:42] uh just the first verse. Malachi 1 and
[19:45] 1.
[19:47] Malachi, the last book of the Old
[19:49] Testament.
[19:53] I have two scriptures that may not sound
[19:55] like they go together. The second one
[19:57] will be in Revelation, the first
[19:59] chapter, ninth verse. I'm going to read
[20:01] these first two and then we'll have some
[20:03] some slides. uh one quote in the slides
[20:08] and uh if you just look this way for a
[20:10] moment uh what what the service will do
[20:13] this evening what I pray that it will do
[20:15] is is uh in some of the statements that
[20:19] are being made
[20:21] I want you to listen real close now some
[20:23] of the statements that are being made
[20:24] the statement will be like an ingredient
[20:27] like I said to my wife uh this today I
[20:31] said the service would be like the main
[20:33] body of a a cake mix or something you're
[20:36] going to mix and you get the main body
[20:39] of it there and then you had to add in
[20:41] the salt and add in the butter and add
[20:43] in all the other things that you know
[20:45] the baking powder whatever more and and
[20:48] and then you hope for a success. Well uh
[20:51] I feel that uh you know we we can have
[20:55] uh you can read messages, you can hear
[20:57] them etc etc. you can hear uh uh sermons
[21:00] preached and so on and but it's very
[21:04] essential that we have the main body of
[21:07] ingredients
[21:08] &gt;&gt; and uh and I think that one of one of
[21:10] the things that I've been pondering for
[21:12] a long time a very long time is about
[21:15] God give me an understanding uh give me
[21:19] a give me a some understanding of your
[21:24] being and who you are and and then I go
[21:28] back to the statement brother Brandham
[21:29] has said and it says it a number of
[21:32] times, God the eternal being. And
[21:35] whenever I got that, you know, he fills
[21:37] all time and space. And I just thought,
[21:39] you know, who who who are you? I know
[21:44] you sent Jesus. I understand that. I
[21:46] know he died for me. I've accepted that.
[21:49] But when I come and I say, "God,
[21:52] who is this God? He fills all time and
[21:55] space. I have to bring it down to the
[21:57] lowest
[21:58] denominator and it's there's space
[22:00] between you and I. And we're going to go
[22:03] into the heavens. We're looking to go
[22:04] into the rapture. And and and
[22:08] God fills all time and space. And God is
[22:11] full of his attributes. And so that that
[22:14] that's something to ponder. You might
[22:16] say, "Well, that doesn't matter to me. I
[22:18] just believe what do you believe and who
[22:21] do you believe in?" And these are things
[22:23] that are important. And I find that the
[22:26] prophet, he said some things that
[22:31] indicate very very firmly that he had a
[22:35] contact with God, the eternal God. He
[22:38] could reach out, lay hold of because he
[22:41] knew who it was. He knew who it was. It
[22:43] was mystical. He even talks about it
[22:46] being mystical. It's it's a people
[22:48] thought he was, you know, a fortune
[22:50] teller or this that the other thing
[22:51] because it reached on out into the
[22:53] mystical things. But you have a you have
[22:55] a servant who could speak so
[22:58] simplistically
[23:00] and and have an answer from God. And
[23:03] that's what we want.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; We want we want that supernatural God to
[23:08] reach down and do supernatural things
[23:10] right in your life, in your home, and
[23:12] and you know, a real a real God. Amen. A
[23:17] living God.
[23:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what we want?
[23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; All right. We'll read in Malachi 1 and1.
[23:26] The burden of the word of the Lord to
[23:30] Israel by Malachi.
[23:34] And I just want you to keep in your
[23:36] heart now the burden of the word of the
[23:39] Lord because we're going to be dealing
[23:40] with that in Revelation 1 and9.
[23:45] I John who also am your brother and
[23:50] companion in tribulation
[23:52] and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus
[23:56] Christ was in the aisle that is called
[23:59] Patmas for the word of God and for the
[24:03] testimony of Jesus Christ. I'm your
[24:06] companion
[24:08] &gt;&gt; in tribulation.
[24:15] I might just say this before we even
[24:17] start. I have it written down.
[24:21] We need to be taught
[24:23] and we need to be taught not how to
[24:26] escape hardships,
[24:29] but how to go through them victoriously.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; People that keep coming to church and
[24:36] they keep thinking the minister's going
[24:37] to preach, I'm going to I'm going to
[24:39] escape this hardship. No, no. I I think
[24:43] it's the wrong approach. And then they
[24:45] say, "Well, that didn't do it. You know,
[24:47] maybe I'm not a believer. Maybe I'm not
[24:49] bride. Maybe the preacher didn't preach
[24:52] the right service or whatever,
[24:55] whatever." And it opens the door. We're
[24:57] We're not here to escape them. And I can
[25:00] prove it by the scripture. We're not
[25:02] here to escape hardships. We're here to
[25:04] go through them victoriously. I am your
[25:07] brother and companion in hardship or in
[25:11] tribulation.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, you may be seated. Keep
[25:15] your Bible if you would. I'm going to
[25:18] read one scripture while you're seated
[25:21] because I'm going then immediately to
[25:23] some uh some slides
[25:26] and Revelation 3 and the first verse.
[25:31] And I read this because the first slide
[25:33] is referring back to it. And unto the
[25:36] angel of the church of in Sardis, write
[25:40] these things saith he that hath the
[25:42] seven spirits of God and the seven
[25:45] stars. I know thy works that thou hast a
[25:50] name that thou livest and art dead. And
[25:55] brother Brandham is referring to I know
[25:59] here in this first quote. So, if we can
[26:01] just uh and I'll read as we go along.
[26:06] Now, the Lord God Almighty says, "I know
[26:10] there he is walking in the midst of his
[26:13] people. There he is, the chief shepherd
[26:16] of the flock, but does he hold back the
[26:20] persecution?
[26:21] Does he stem the tribulation?" No, he
[26:25] does not. He simply says, "I know your
[26:28] tribulation. I am not at all unmindful
[26:32] of your suffering.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; What a what a stumbling block this is to
[26:37] so many people. What a stumbling block
[26:40] this is to so many people. And I trust
[26:42] that it's not a stumbling block to
[26:44] anyone here or that hears the service.
[26:48] What a stumbling block this is uh to the
[26:52] people like like Israel. They wonder if
[26:55] God really loves them. How can God be
[26:58] just and loving if he stands by and
[27:01] watches his people suffer? This is what
[27:04] they asked in Malachi 1:3.
[27:08] The the burden of the word of the Lord
[27:11] to Israel by Malachi. I have loved you,
[27:16] saith the Lord. Uh
[27:22] 1 to three.
[27:27] All right. I have loved you, sayeth the
[27:29] Lord.
[27:30] Um
[27:32] yet you say, "Wherein hast thou loved
[27:34] us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? Sayeth
[27:37] the Lord. Yet I loved Jacob. I and I
[27:40] hated Esau and laid his mountains and
[27:44] his heritage waste. for the dragons of
[27:47] the wilderness. You see,
[27:54] I want to get this other one.
[27:59] You see, they could not figure out God's
[28:01] love. They thought that love meant no
[28:03] suffering. They thought that love meant
[28:06] a a baby with parental care. But God
[28:09] said that his love was elective love.
[28:12] The proof of his love is election. that
[28:15] no matter what happened, his love was
[28:17] proven truly by the fact that they were
[28:20] chosen unto salvation because God hath
[28:24] chosen you to salvation through
[28:26] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[28:28] of the truth. Now, you can just uh uh h
[28:32] have a look at me for a moment. I'm not
[28:35] uh uh uh just that young but in all the
[28:39] years I have never saw the scripture
[28:42] Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated
[28:45] in the term or in the in the format of
[28:48] elective love until I saw it here in the
[28:52] in the message
[28:56] it's you you may think well uh we would
[28:58] think in the human terms oh god decided
[29:02] that one he loved the other one he
[29:04] hated. No, that's not it. He elected to
[29:07] love one.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; He elected to love. You are not just
[29:11] chosen, you know, because of any good
[29:15] thing or any works or anything else. It
[29:18] is the fact that God elected and he has
[29:21] a he has a he has freedom of choice. He
[29:24] has absolute freedom of choice. Do you
[29:26] accept that? you have and like if you
[29:29] don't get that then you think well uh uh
[29:32] you know it's based on something it's
[29:34] it's based on one thing and that is God
[29:36] has election he's free to elect
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Jacob have I loved who's going to
[29:42] question that Jacob have I loved let's
[29:45] let's forget the other one for a moment
[29:47] let's forget Esau Jacob have I loved has
[29:49] he got a right to love one
[29:52] &gt;&gt; has he got a love to Has he got a right
[29:54] to leave one out I'll just leave it like
[29:56] that say, "Jacob have I loved, Esau have
[29:59] I hated, and uh because God hath chosen
[30:03] you to salvation through sanctification
[30:05] of the spirit and belief of the
[30:10] of the truth.
[30:14] He may commit you to death as he did
[30:17] Paul.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; He may commit you to suffering as he did
[30:21] Job. That is his prerogative."
[30:24] So, we just simply want to say whatever
[30:26] it is. And I have a phrase, I use it all
[30:29] the time. Uh, I may sound like a broken
[30:33] record, especially to my wife. I said,
[30:35] it is what it is.
[30:38] That's the best way to deal with things.
[30:40] Says, well, you know, the world this and
[30:43] that and all this all this perversion or
[30:46] all something else and everything and
[30:48] people are, you know, laxidasical. It is
[30:51] what it is. I asked brother Brandham
[30:54] once
[30:56] uh you know concerning the will of God
[30:58] and he said well when people come and
[31:01] and ask me about their about the will of
[31:03] God for their life unless he said God
[31:05] gives a vision of course if he gives a
[31:07] vision that's different but he said I I
[31:10] I
[31:12] usually ask them how they have found
[31:14] their life going in the last in the past
[31:17] and he says when they tell me how it's
[31:19] gone in the past I usually say Well,
[31:22] that's probably how it'll go in the
[31:24] future.
[31:27] That's very very wise.
[31:29] I heard an account of uh
[31:33] uh I don't I don't know just exactly how
[31:35] it went, but there was a a man had a
[31:37] little store in a community in a farming
[31:40] community and it was a whole valley and
[31:43] people would be moving in and moving out
[31:46] whatever. But but people it was new area
[31:49] and people were moving in and so uh this
[31:53] one family was moving in and the fellow
[31:55] stopped this little weed general store.
[31:58] didn't didn't have a town, just a store
[32:01] by the road. And he said, "Uh, you know,
[32:03] we're we're moving in from a certain
[32:05] state and we like to know how are the
[32:07] people in this valley." He said, "Well,
[32:10] how did you find the people where you
[32:13] come from?" He said, this one fell said,
[32:16] "Ah." He said, "They're just a bunch
[32:18] of," he said, "they're just a bunch of
[32:19] thieves there." He said, "It was
[32:21] terrible." He said, "I had to get out of
[32:23] there." He said, 'Well, I you'll
[32:26] probably find the people here about the
[32:27] same. And the next people that came in,
[32:30] they asked him the same question.
[32:33] How are the people in this valley? And
[32:34] he said, "Well, how did you find the
[32:36] people where you come from?" Oh, he
[32:37] said, "It was just wonderful. We we were
[32:40] just like one great big family." He
[32:42] said, "Uh, people helped one another and
[32:44] they would work for one another and he
[32:46] said they would, you know, lend their
[32:48] equipment or whatever." He said, "They
[32:50] were just wonderful." He said, "We had a
[32:51] hard time leaving." He said, 'I I I
[32:53] imagine you'll find the people here
[32:55] about the same.
[32:58] And I think uh now now I now I had a
[33:00] prophet saying, "Well, how how do you
[33:02] how do you find things in the past?" And
[33:05] they're asking about the perfect will of
[33:07] God. It isn't that God didn't have a
[33:09] perfect will for their lives, but it is
[33:11] whether we as individuals submit to it
[33:14] and go to it. And you can't submit to
[33:16] the perfect will of God. Read this quote
[33:19] and be trying to escape all the
[33:22] hardship.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; Thus says the Lord, you're not going to
[33:25] do it.
[33:34] Um
[33:37] All right. That is his prerogative. He
[33:39] is sovereign. That we're in the third
[33:41] line. He is sovereign but it is all with
[33:44] a purpose. I want you to notice that if
[33:46] he did not have a purpose then he would
[33:49] be the author of frustration and not of
[33:52] peace. His purpose is that after we have
[33:55] suffered a while we would we would be
[33:58] made perfect be established strengthened
[34:02] and settled as Job said he put strength
[34:05] in us. Job 23 and6 you you see he
[34:09] himself suffered. He learned obedience
[34:12] by the things that he suffered. He was
[34:14] actually made perfect by the things uh
[34:17] that he suffered.
[34:21] Though he were a son, yet learned his
[34:23] obedience by the things which he
[34:24] suffered in Hebrews 5:8-9. And being
[34:27] made perfect, he became the author of
[34:29] eternal salvation unto all them that
[34:32] obey him. In plain language, the very
[34:36] character of Jesus was perfected by
[34:38] suffering. And according to Paul, he has
[34:41] left his church a measure of suffering
[34:44] that they too by their faith in God
[34:47] while suffering for him would come to a
[34:49] place of perfection. Why did he want
[34:52] this?
[34:54] My brethren, count it all joy when you
[34:57] fall into diverse temptations, knowing
[34:59] this, that the trying of your faith
[35:02] workketh patience. But let patience have
[35:05] her perfect work, that you may be
[35:07] perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that quote? And I
[35:16] know that you will.
[35:18] Now I wanted I wanted just to say that
[35:22] to read that as a as a means of you you
[35:26] might draw back from
[35:29] uh
[35:31] some some thought
[35:33] and the reason I'm just being very very
[35:36] careful at the beginning because I want
[35:39] if you miss the beginning you actually
[35:42] miss the whole service.
[35:44] Uh and here's the direction I'm going to
[35:46] go the Lord willing. And I've really
[35:49] really waited on God for this because I
[35:53] wanted it clear in my own mind. I go
[35:56] back to the beginning and number one,
[36:00] the word coming forth from the bosom of
[36:03] the father to be the lamb of God.
[36:09] Uh
[36:11] how many recall he was the lamb slain
[36:14] before the foundation of the world?
[36:18] How do you have even that thought,
[36:20] whatever it means to us? How do you even
[36:24] have that picture without there being a
[36:27] burden for the word of the Lord? It
[36:30] might be a burden of purpose.
[36:33] It might be a burden of of redemption,
[36:37] but it was a determination in God's
[36:40] mind, and you were there.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a fall. Satan's
[36:47] going to uh come and and and try and
[36:50] destroy the creation and I'm going to
[36:52] redeem it
[36:54] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to redeem every person.
[36:56] I'm going to redeem every son. I've
[36:58] already elected them. I've already
[37:01] chosen them. I've already predestinated
[37:03] them. This will be part of my family and
[37:06] I will have them with me. So there had
[37:08] to be a a burden of the word of the Lord
[37:11] from the very very very inception
[37:15] &gt;&gt; of things. Number two, the burden of the
[37:18] word of the Lord in the Old Testament in
[37:21] types and shadows.
[37:24] Number three, the burden of the word of
[37:26] the Lord in Jesus, the word made flesh.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; We're going to take some real quick
[37:32] turns here in just a moment. Number
[37:35] four, the burden of the word of the Lord
[37:37] throughout the New Testament church.
[37:40] And number five, the burden of the word
[37:42] of the Lord in this last age in the
[37:46] revealing of the son of man. And I can
[37:49] show you clearly in the scripture and
[37:51] did so last Sunday. The more he was
[37:53] revealed, the more burden there was and
[37:57] the more misunderstanding there was. But
[37:59] the more burden there was to carry that
[38:03] revealing and to live that revealing
[38:06] because friends, this this is Satan's
[38:09] Eden.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; You understand that? This is Satan's
[38:12] Eden. It's not going to become simpler
[38:16] or it's not going to become easier. It's
[38:18] going to be more difficult all the time.
[38:20] simply living that life in uh in uh in
[38:24] the state the world is in.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Now, we need to be taught, as I said a
[38:30] few moments ago, not how to escape the
[38:32] hardship or pressures and rigors
[38:37] of a believer's life, but rather how to
[38:41] go through them victoriously.
[38:43] This can only be done when one has the
[38:46] correct view of their life in
[38:49] relationship
[38:51] to God and his purpose. When I see the
[38:55] majesty and the magnificence of God who
[39:00] rolls, as the prophet says, rolls the
[39:02] stars off his fingers. And and and we're
[39:06] worried about life.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; We're worried about, you know, how we're
[39:10] going to make it. I said and and and
[39:15] one of the statements that brother
[39:16] Brandham says and I don't want to just
[39:18] leave everything on him. I want to bring
[39:20] it to you. But one of the statements
[39:22] that he makes is he says, "Oh, you
[39:25] brothers that are in the message a lot
[39:27] of time." He says, "Oh, when I when I
[39:31] think of these things, when I see that,
[39:33] he said, denominations just fade away."
[39:38] You
[39:38] &gt;&gt; remember what he said that
[39:39] &gt;&gt; denominations he just got so caught in
[39:43] the in the truth of the word and how God
[39:46] is dealing and when when people
[39:48] denominated they died but when he talks
[39:50] about it he says when I talk about this
[39:52] when I when I see this he said
[39:54] denominations just fade away. Those are
[39:57] huge great organizations but he just
[39:59] seen them fade away. If you see the
[40:02] substance of the service tonight, it
[40:05] will really help you to see that your
[40:08] life in relationship to the great
[40:11] eternal God that fills all time and
[40:13] space and he decided, he determined to
[40:18] elect you to redemption. If you don't
[40:21] believe that election, then there's no
[40:23] purpose being here.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; But if you believe in election, then we
[40:26] might as well believe it all the way and
[40:28] be fanatical about it. I believe that
[40:31] God, God, who is God? Who is God? And
[40:35] Brother Brown talks about that. I think
[40:36] we'll probably I'll quote it. Who is
[40:38] God? This great eternal one who had no
[40:41] beginning and no end. This God that
[40:44] flung the galaxies out and the stars and
[40:47] the planets and gave them names. This
[40:50] God.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; This God, as as one colored brother
[40:54] said, this God who makes a lemon sour
[40:58] and a peach sweet. This God who puts the
[41:01] dew drops on the lily leaf and it
[41:04] quivers in the sunlight. This God that
[41:07] raises Christ from the dead. This God
[41:10] that will NOT SEE NOT ONE of his
[41:13] children
[41:14] pulled out of his hand.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; This God.
[41:18] And then h unless we have a view of this
[41:21] God, then what is our sickness or what
[41:24] is our infirmity in the in the view of
[41:27] that God or what is our problem or what
[41:29] is our financial difficulties in the
[41:32] view of that God? What is anything that
[41:35] we're concerned about in comparison or
[41:38] in relationship to that God? Everything
[41:41] must be in relationship to that God.
[41:44] What is my life in relationship to that
[41:46] God? That's what's important.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Our span of life here is but a fleeting
[41:57] moment in relationship to eternal life.
[42:01] In fact is you can't relate it to
[42:04] eternal life because we've had a
[42:06] beginning and we've had an end as far as
[42:09] mortal life is concerned. But in the
[42:11] immortal season the prophet said you've
[42:14] had eternal life. If you have eternal
[42:16] life, I will be reading it. Then you
[42:18] always had that life and and uh you had
[42:22] that life in God's mind because he is
[42:25] eternal. He's going to have children
[42:27] that are like him. And enough said on
[42:30] that subject. He said, "Let's just take
[42:33] back and find out uh just a minute who
[42:37] God is. Let's look back at the beginning
[42:40] of time." This is a little picture I
[42:43] want to draw. So you can get some
[42:46] conception of who this being is
[42:51] &gt;&gt; in our midst tonight.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; You see what he's saying? He said he
[42:55] wanted the people to get some concept,
[42:58] some conception of who this being is
[43:01] that's in the meeting.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; And I went quickly to the end of the
[43:05] service and he displayed and manifested,
[43:08] not brother Brandham, but God did
[43:10] through that vessel. displayed and
[43:13] manifested who he was to get the
[43:15] attention of the people and to let them
[43:17] know I am God. It's like he's screaming,
[43:20] "I'm God and I'm here and DON'T DON'T BE
[43:24] BLIND. DON'T BE TOO DULL. See me and and
[43:27] I'm speaking to you and I'm drawing you
[43:30] and yes, THAT'S MY SPIRIT. THAT'S WHAT
[43:32] IT'S NOT JUST SOME FEELING THAT you
[43:34] have."
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe if we come to the
[43:38] place where we GIVE OUR FATHER THE
[43:40] recognition that he should have. We
[43:43] you'll receive a lot more from him.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; He says, I want to uh this this is a
[43:51] little picture I want to draw so you can
[43:54] get some conception of who is who this
[43:57] being is in our midst tonight that's
[44:00] moving amongst us. Friends, I didn't
[44:03] choose these at random. This is
[44:06] something that has spoken to my own
[44:07] heart
[44:08] &gt;&gt; and that's why I'm bringing it to you.
[44:10] He said, "If you could only realize who
[44:14] that is." I'm taking his words and
[44:16] bringing it to this service tonight. If
[44:18] you could only realize who that is,
[44:22] healing would be a secondary or a minor
[44:26] thing to you. If you're sick or
[44:28] afflicted, healing is not a minor thing
[44:31] to you, but it should be in relationship
[44:35] to who this God is. the physical thing,
[44:39] the mortal thing should just become a
[44:42] very uh a very small and irrelevant
[44:46] thing in sight of God
[44:48] &gt;&gt; in the view of God.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; M maybe we you don't think about him
[44:53] enough. We need to think about him. Who
[44:55] is this God? Who's who's speaking this
[44:58] now through a prophet? You mean it takes
[45:00] time with the spirit of Elijah to say if
[45:03] you only could realize who's here
[45:05] tonight?
[45:08] Healing would be a secondary or a minor
[45:11] thing to you if you could just see who
[45:15] he is.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; In the continuing in the same message,
[45:21] who is God? Let us see coming out of
[45:24] space where there's nothing. Let's make
[45:26] a little white light like a mystic light
[45:30] halo. And that was the logos that went
[45:34] out of God in the beginning. That was
[45:36] the son of God that came out of the
[45:39] bosom of the father. That was what was
[45:42] in the beginning was the word and the
[45:45] word was with God and the word was God
[45:48] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[45:50] among us. In the beginning was God and
[45:54] then out of God came the logos a part of
[45:57] God that went out of God. And he said,
[46:00] "Let us notice." He said, "I have to
[46:02] make this before going back into it just
[46:05] uh just like a little picture drama here
[46:09] for you in a a moment in order to get
[46:12] one point to you. Who what is
[46:17] in our midst tonight?
[46:21] &gt;&gt; That was the whole point.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; I have to get this drama. I have to get
[46:27] in in in the beginning. If anybody has
[46:30] the authority to go back to the
[46:32] beginning, it would be a prophet of God.
[46:35] And one that was here, one that you can
[46:37] hear the voice of, if you wish, on tape,
[46:40] one that you can read a message book if
[46:43] you have the interest to pick it up and
[46:45] to read it and to ponder that this God
[46:48] sent this kind of a servant to get the
[46:51] people. If you could only believe and
[46:54] realize who is in the midst of you. Not
[46:57] somebody way off into space somewhere.
[47:00] Not somebody in some other part of the
[47:02] world, but the God who by elective love
[47:07] has chosen the certain people. And if
[47:09] we're not it, he he just says plainly,
[47:12] if we weren't in the mind of God with
[47:14] eternal life, then we haven't got it.
[47:16] But if we did have and he's called you
[47:19] to if he's called you to eternal life
[47:21] and you know it was the spirit of God,
[47:24] YOU CAN GO BACK AND SAY, "GOD SPOKE TO
[47:26] ME.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; GOD called me." That's it.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; That's what you have to do. GO BACK TO
[47:33] THAT. GO BACK TO BETHL. GO BACK TO THAT
[47:36] PLACE THAT GOD CALLED YOU. Say that God
[47:40] called me. Who is God? the eternal being
[47:44] filling all time and space is here in
[47:46] the service. It could be in the simplest
[47:49] service, could be in the home, could be
[47:51] in the prayer time, in your own. But
[47:53] God, I can tell you friends, I did
[47:55] something I've never done before uh in
[47:58] in Switzerland last time I played the
[48:01] service here when brother Ron Spencer
[48:03] preached, but I needed I had a I had a
[48:06] very very great great burdening
[48:09] burdensome questions and burdensome
[48:12] problems and things that I was dealing
[48:14] with. Not for a day, not for a week, not
[48:17] for a month, but maybe two or three
[48:20] years. nothing, nothing of a physical
[48:22] nature, nothing within my family. It was
[48:26] just something that I was uh burdened
[48:29] over and I was very very burdened and I
[48:32] I I just held it before God. I didn't
[48:35] hardly speak to anybody about it. But
[48:38] then brother Ron Spencer spoke and I I
[48:43] played the service here on a Wednesday
[48:45] night
[48:46] and I can't I can't tell you exactly
[48:49] because these are eternal things and
[48:50] they're not they're not made for the
[48:53] English or any other language but it was
[48:54] just within my own soul and bosom and
[48:57] I'd pondered these things. It was like
[48:59] God had been talking to me and preparing
[49:01] me and he was saying, you know,
[49:06] I was getting the not like a voice but
[49:09] like a a distinct impression.
[49:14] Don't take your counsel from others or
[49:17] even professional people or don't take
[49:20] your counsel. And it was like God was
[49:23] saying to me very tenderly, I've led you
[49:26] all these years. I've led you since
[49:29] you're a young man, I led you. I've led
[49:32] your family. And I'm I'm agreeing with
[49:34] it. Yes, you have. You have. You don't
[49:37] even And I was saying, now I'm getting
[49:40] very personal. I was saying, Lord, you
[49:42] didn't give me any sons. You gave me
[49:44] three wonderful daughters, but I don't
[49:46] have sons. And I I've I've thought about
[49:49] that. And I thought, well, you you've
[49:51] given me three wonderful daughters, but
[49:53] I don't have sons. And he he was saying
[49:55] like I I I'm I'm your father.
[49:59] I've led you.
[50:01] I've I've provided. I've watched over.
[50:04] And I could see where he watched over
[50:07] and did things when I didn't have any
[50:10] knowledge of it. And the service ended
[50:12] and it was such a powerful service. I
[50:16] was sitting literally on the edge of my
[50:18] seat. I was transfixed.
[50:21] And uh
[50:23] when the service ended, a couple people
[50:25] came up over here and they asked brother
[50:27] Tom, brother brother Ron Spencer to go
[50:30] and and he he prayed with these but he
[50:32] was so worn out and he was just like
[50:35] staggering and so they helped him off
[50:37] the platform and I was sitting down in
[50:40] here and and I just I just vacated my
[50:45] wife and Linda was there and they were
[50:46] sitting with some others and the place
[50:48] was packed and I ran up the aisle.
[50:52] This is this is who you call pastor. I
[50:55] ran up the aisle. I ran across because
[50:58] they were already whisking them out and
[51:00] they were halfway down the building that
[51:02] side just getting ready to go out the
[51:04] double doors when I caught them. And I
[51:06] said, "Brother Ron, Brother Ron, I
[51:09] thought, you know, the woman at the well
[51:11] had her moment. This was mine.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; I'd never done this in my life."
[51:17] &gt;&gt; And I called him. I said, "Brother Ron,
[51:21] I I I just want you in that atmosphere."
[51:23] It wasn't It wasn't Brother Ron Spencer.
[51:25] It was the It was the God that was in
[51:29] the midst.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying, brothers?
[51:35] I was coming to Jesus Christ.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; I looked beyond the vessel. I didn't
[51:41] even have that in my mind. But I wanted
[51:44] him. I want you to pray for my family. I
[51:48] want you to pray for me. He said, "Sure,
[51:50] brother Ed." And he just weaving around,
[51:54] but it was my faith who I was going to
[51:56] touch
[51:57] &gt;&gt; and who I had already made contact with.
[51:59] And I waved to my wife and she came out
[52:02] and and Linda came with her and we we
[52:05] just were in a huddle there and quite a
[52:07] few people around because the service
[52:09] was essentially ending, but people
[52:11] weren't leaving. And brother Ron just
[52:13] began to pray.
[52:17] Now I'll just tell you friends within 90
[52:20] days
[52:22] within 90 days
[52:25] all the questions and all the problems
[52:29] and everything vanished
[52:33] &gt;&gt; and I didn't have to do a thing. God
[52:36] just came down and worked things this
[52:40] way, that way, brought people in, did
[52:42] whatever. It's just like I sat back and
[52:44] it was a kneejerk. I and my wife, we've
[52:48] been stunned for several weeks.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; You're quiet.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; That's the God I'm talking about.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; That's the God who's our counselor.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; That's the God who's wonderful.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; That's the God who's living God.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; That's the God who gave you life,
[53:06] &gt;&gt; gave you eternal life.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; And if people could only realize who is
[53:11] in our midst,
[53:13] Every service would be vastly different.
[53:15] Wouldn't matter who's behind the
[53:17] pullpit, BUT PEOPLE WOULD MAKE CONTACT
[53:19] WITH THAT GOD. And that God WOULD WORK
[53:22] IN YOUR LIFE LONG AFTER YOU WENT OUT
[53:24] THESE DOORS. THAT'S THE GOD HE'S WAITING
[53:27] TO DO. THAT FRIENDS, I want you to
[53:29] believe that tonight. TAKE THIS
[53:31] INSTRUCTION. THAT GOD,
[53:34] &gt;&gt; HE CAN TAKE THE IMPOSSIBLE AND TURN it
[53:37] around.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE HE'S THE ONE. HE COULD CREATE
[53:40] ANOTHER GALAXY OR ANOTHER MILLION
[53:42] GALAXIES IF HE WANTED TO. BUT HE WANTS
[53:45] TO BE YOUR FATHER. HE WANTS TO
[53:47] DEMONSTRATE I AM THE FATHER. And like
[53:51] Jesus Jesus when he was asked how we how
[53:54] we should pray said our father.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; First word which art in heaven.
[54:08] Jesus
[54:09] was manifested now the burden of the
[54:12] word of the Lord. I'm going way back
[54:16] beyond my understanding. I won't even
[54:20] attempt to. But somewhere, I don't even
[54:23] know exactly how, but somehow I cannot
[54:26] think of a lamb of God that was bleeding
[54:31] before the foundation of the world
[54:34] without believing that somewhere somehow
[54:37] there was a a burden or a determination
[54:41] that the redemption the redemption
[54:44] project is a finished work. And even
[54:48] though there must be maybe much
[54:50] suffering and much carrying of the word
[54:53] in its different phases, it shall all
[54:55] come to pass. And I will find the
[54:57] faithful people. I WILL FIND THE
[55:00] faithful men. I will find the faithful
[55:02] women. And I'll lay it upon their heart.
[55:05] And they SHALL BE TRUE IN EVERY AGE.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Can the people say, "Amen."
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:13] So Jesus was manifested in the Old
[55:16] Testament. All who were part of the
[55:19] shadows and types carried the burden of
[55:22] the word. Even in the shadows and the
[55:24] types
[55:26] and Christ is revealed in his own word.
[55:28] He he says he was alive in the Old
[55:31] Testament manifested.
[55:34] I just want to let you see a little
[55:36] something here if you can stand it.
[55:39] Watch. when Jesus was manifested in the
[55:41] Old Testament as we believe it. Now you
[55:45] preachers out there, you can argue with
[55:47] it. Do whatever you want to, but I'm
[55:50] talking to my he said what I what I
[55:52] think. See, and when he was manifest in
[55:55] the Old Testament in a theophony
[55:58] in the person of Melzdc, don't get lost
[56:00] in the terminology, but he was
[56:03] manifested. That's the key. He was
[56:06] manifested.
[56:08] And I have to I have to emphasize that
[56:11] he said he was manifested in a theophony
[56:14] in the person of Melzdc.
[56:16] Not a priesthood which be would be a
[56:18] group of people but the person the man
[56:23] for he said this man had not yet been
[56:26] born.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus hadn't been born. So it's not the
[56:30] burden of the word of the Lord that
[56:32] Jesus carried. It's a burden of the word
[56:35] of the Lord that was carried in the Old
[56:37] Testament. But it was Christ in Noah.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; And he preached for 120 years with very
[56:44] little success. And that's where a
[56:46] prophet preached on just few, very few.
[56:50] Only eight souls came into the ark. But
[56:52] that was a burden of the word of the
[56:54] Lord. Listen friends, we can just, you
[56:57] know, let it roll off of our lips, but
[56:59] it it's not that simple to think that a
[57:02] man got up every day for 120 years and
[57:06] preached that there's going to be rain
[57:07] from heaven and the scientists de
[57:09] declared something opposite and all the
[57:12] intellectuals declared something
[57:13] opposite. There's never been rain. It
[57:16] only comes by due and and science proves
[57:19] there's no water up there. Nevertheless,
[57:22] this man carried the burden of the word
[57:25] of the Lord. And the word of the Lord
[57:27] was it's going to rain and there's going
[57:29] to be a flood.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; And he believed it to the point of
[57:34] getting his own family locked up inside.
[57:36] And there was no rain, but he still
[57:38] believed that word. And suddenly the
[57:41] earth opened up and the waters gushed
[57:44] out of the earth and waters came from
[57:46] heaven and there was a flood according
[57:48] to the word of the Lord. But Noah
[57:51] carried the burden. And as it was in the
[57:54] days of Noah, when they planted and they
[57:56] build it, are you listening to me? Even
[57:59] so shall it be in the day when the son
[58:02] of man is revealed. And who's carrying
[58:06] that? Hello, here we are. Say, I carry
[58:09] that. I will declare the truth. I will
[58:13] live it by God's grace. I will declare
[58:16] that the that we had this kind of a
[58:18] message and this kind of a messenger in
[58:20] this perverted generation.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Are you getting a little bit of where
[58:26] I'm going?
[58:28] &gt;&gt; As it was in the days of Noah
[58:31] and as it was in the days of Abraham, it
[58:34] wasn't easy to say, "Everywhere you put
[58:37] the your sole of your foot, I give you
[58:39] that land." And he just started walking
[58:42] and he believed God. And he didn't he he
[58:44] he he's getting the land, but where's
[58:46] the son? Who's going to inherit this
[58:49] land? Eleazar, his servant, who's gonna
[58:52] who's going to be heir? He says to God,
[58:54] "WHO'S MY HEIR? WHO'S GOING TO HAVE ALL
[58:57] of this?"
[58:59] &gt;&gt; It was a small thing to God. He let He
[59:02] He He allowed Sarah to become old and
[59:06] dried up. And he allowed uh Abraham to
[59:09] become old because what is it to God to
[59:13] reverse the cells and turn them back to
[59:15] youth again and to make them active and
[59:18] to cause a birth? Remember Isaac was I
[59:22] Isaac was born. Hallelujah. He was a son
[59:25] that was given because he was the type.
[59:27] He was a shadow. So even producing the
[59:30] shadow, there was a burden of the word
[59:33] of the Lord to produce a shadow
[59:36] &gt;&gt; TO PRODUCE A TYPE. THEY WEREN'T EVEN
[59:38] LIVING FOR THE real thing. They were
[59:40] ONLY GIVING A SHADOW, A NEGATIVE OF THE
[59:43] POSITIVE.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; I don't know whether it means anything
[59:49] to you, but it means a whole lot to me.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; They live just to be a shadow
[59:54] &gt;&gt; of something that was coming. And then
[59:57] finally would come a day I have to keep
[59:59] just referring to it so you'll catch THE
[1:00:01] CONNECTION. FINALLY THE DAY WOULD COME
[1:00:03] WHEN IT'S NOT A SHADOW ANYMORE.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; But the reality is how
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; God has not called us to live a shadow.
[1:00:11] He's called us to look back. See there
[1:00:14] it was in the time of the shadow and
[1:00:16] there it was in the time of Christ and
[1:00:18] there it was in the early church. And
[1:00:21] here you've had it all the way up. And
[1:00:23] now you should have you SHOULD BE
[1:00:25] EMPOWERED. YOU SHOULD be you should have
[1:00:28] a heart of faith. Say he he was loyal
[1:00:30] there. He was loyal there. He did it
[1:00:33] there. HE USED OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS AND
[1:00:36] SEERS and sages and he used THEM ALL THE
[1:00:39] WAY DOWN THROUGH HISTORY AND HE WILL not
[1:00:42] fail.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Great is his faithfulness.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:49] I won't apologize over being
[1:00:53] over being uh captured by this because
[1:00:56] I've been pondering it for days and
[1:00:58] days.
[1:01:00] And so this man was not born was not yet
[1:01:05] had not been born. But he was in the
[1:01:07] theophony.
[1:01:09] So he had no father, no mother. He was
[1:01:12] God himself.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; He was manifested. Manifest means to
[1:01:16] appear. He appeared. He made himself
[1:01:19] real. Are you following me?
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Lift your hands up if you're
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; all right. Fine.
[1:01:29] So, he had no father. And that's why uh
[1:01:32] Melzdc had no father, no mother, no
[1:01:35] beginning of days, but he was called
[1:01:38] king of Salem and king of peace, king of
[1:01:41] righteousness because it was a shadow.
[1:01:44] God was laying down a shadow.
[1:01:47] Now I I want you to get another
[1:01:48] principle please for the another
[1:01:51] ingredient
[1:01:53] for this important mix.
[1:01:58] God would cause in the time of the time
[1:02:03] of the types and shadows. He would cause
[1:02:05] people to
[1:02:09] have a burden to have a certain burden
[1:02:12] for righteousness
[1:02:14] and they would live their lives
[1:02:18] live their lives
[1:02:20] and those lives would be scribed and the
[1:02:22] events would be scribed by scribes
[1:02:27] and God watched over that it would come
[1:02:30] into a book called the Bible because
[1:02:33] there would be a people that would have
[1:02:35] to go back to this word. So they were
[1:02:38] living out the word but there was no
[1:02:40] word for them to know that they were
[1:02:42] living out the word.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; God God of election who had called them
[1:02:47] and predestinated them and was guiding
[1:02:49] them. It goes to show you that we can be
[1:02:52] guided as they were guided.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; They were guided without a book.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; They were guided without the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; They were guided in such a way that they
[1:03:01] just lived their lives. Was it a life of
[1:03:03] ease? No,
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; THEY HAD MANY TRIALS, MANY TRIBULATIONS,
[1:03:08] but they just plowed along.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; They just continued to move and plow
[1:03:13] along day after day. Did some of them go
[1:03:16] to school, fellas? I suppose they did. I
[1:03:19] don't know if they had anything like
[1:03:20] universities, but whatever they did. And
[1:03:23] Moses, he had to be educated in all. He
[1:03:26] was he he became so wise he could teach
[1:03:28] the Egyptians. And yet God stripped him
[1:03:32] down.
[1:03:34] Why? Because he was carrying a burden of
[1:03:36] the word of the Lord. There must be a
[1:03:38] deliverer for the children of Israel.
[1:03:41] And he and why did he have that burden?
[1:03:43] And the prophet said he looked out the
[1:03:45] same window that Pharaoh looked out. And
[1:03:48] Pharaoh saw them as his slaves to build
[1:03:50] cities. And Moses saw them as God's
[1:03:53] people.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach, friends.
[1:04:01] And you got to deal with it.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Moses, this Moses elected of God, went
[1:04:07] out and killed a man.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; And you wouldn't want A MAN BEHIND THE
[1:04:11] PULPIT THAT HAD murdered a man. BUT HE
[1:04:13] WAS SO DRIVEN
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; that these people, HE WAS SO DRIVEN BY
[1:04:18] THE BURDEN OF THE word of THE LORD.
[1:04:20] THESE PEOPLE MUST BE FREE. YOU MIGHT BE
[1:04:22] SAYING, "ARE YOU SAYING, WELL, THAT
[1:04:24] CAUSED HIM TO KILL A MAN?" WELL, he did
[1:04:27] it.
[1:04:28] He saw two striving and he he smoked the
[1:04:31] Egyptian and buried them in the sand and
[1:04:34] tried to hide from the the one thing
[1:04:36] about the Bible that's so wonderful. It
[1:04:38] tells the good and the bad.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; AND GOD'S NOT AFRAID of the good or the
[1:04:43] bad. He's not afraid of either one
[1:04:45] because he has a injection for the bad.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you will not find Moses
[1:04:52] as a murderer in the New Testament. You
[1:04:55] will not find Abraham lying in the New
[1:04:58] Testament. You will not find Rahab as a
[1:05:01] harlot in the New Testament. In fact,
[1:05:03] you'll find her the mother of Jesus
[1:05:05] Christ, one of them. You talk about an
[1:05:08] antidote. And then Satan tries to come
[1:05:10] and bombast you with his uh with your
[1:05:13] mistakes and your errors and your
[1:05:16] weaknesses. YOU TELL HIM TO GO BACK
[1:05:18] WHERE HE CAME FROM.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; He has no right to the ELECT OF GOD. HE
[1:05:24] HAS NO RIGHT TO THE blood wash. If we
[1:05:26] could ONLY GET A CONGREGATION OF people
[1:05:28] that would REFUSE SATAN AND ACCEPT GOD.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; I RECOGNIZE WHO'S HERE IN THIS MIDST AND
[1:05:36] SATAN HAS NO RIGHT IN THIS PLACE. Then I
[1:05:38] tell you, YOU'D HAVE A PLACE WHERE
[1:05:40] SUPERNATURAL is taking place. People
[1:05:43] being healed. That's one of the minor
[1:05:45] things in their but what what's more
[1:05:47] important is their growth and the
[1:05:50] stability and the glory of God.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Christ in Noah, Christ in Abraham. These
[1:06:05] two lived
[1:06:07] uh and bore the weight of the burden of
[1:06:10] the word of the Lord to leave a record
[1:06:14] of types and shadows.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; I just hold that
[1:06:20] MelzDC foreshadowed Jesus Christ as
[1:06:24] priest and king of the most high in a
[1:06:28] theophony form. Jesus Christ had not
[1:06:32] been born yet. Now we move to another
[1:06:35] phase when the word became flesh to
[1:06:38] suffer for sin
[1:06:40] so that he might suffer and die the
[1:06:43] death for our sins and for the sins of
[1:06:46] the world redeeming all back to God. You
[1:06:50] might say, well, how does this relate to
[1:06:52] us? If he hadn't bore our sins, we
[1:06:56] wouldn't be here.
[1:06:59] If you had not bore the weight of our
[1:07:01] sins, we would have no purpose in life.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; We'd be left in darkness.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; You'd be left in utter frustration and
[1:07:09] confusion. I THANK GOD THAT HE SENT
[1:07:13] Jesus Christ
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; as my redeemer, your redeemer.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; And the scripture tells us, and I'm just
[1:07:23] touching highlights now. The scripture
[1:07:25] tells us, "And he went a little further
[1:07:29] and fell on his face and prayed, saying,
[1:07:33] Oh father, if it be possible, let this
[1:07:36] cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I
[1:07:40] will, but as thou wilt."
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; You don't think there was a burden? Of
[1:07:47] course, there was.
[1:07:49] Huge burden.
[1:07:51] The burden of misunderstanding.
[1:07:54] the burden of the cares,
[1:07:57] the burden of his compassion,
[1:08:00] and the burden of the word for
[1:08:02] utterance.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; You carry that.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; There's times when you need to utter
[1:08:11] things
[1:08:13] that are in harmony with the word of
[1:08:15] God. You need to say it.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to give your testimony.
[1:08:19] You have to give your own testimony.
[1:08:22] You have to make your own confession.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; God's not going to come down and and and
[1:08:27] speak it for you.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; You have to give your testimony.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; We have a burden of utterance.
[1:08:34] We have a burden of responsibility.
[1:08:37] We are responsible people.
[1:08:40] Responsible more than all the people of
[1:08:42] the earth. You say, "Well, I have my
[1:08:43] friends and my peers and whatever more
[1:08:45] and I go to I go to school or university
[1:08:48] or college or whatever more or I go with
[1:08:51] I'm a believer like like any other
[1:08:54] believer." That isn't what he's asking
[1:08:55] for. He's asking for you to be a
[1:08:57] believer as he tells you to be a
[1:08:59] believer. He tells you to be be you be
[1:09:02] the one that gives a witness of it. It
[1:09:04] it doesn't mean that we are on the
[1:09:06] street all the time or but in in life in
[1:09:10] life we give witness to what our
[1:09:12] conviction is.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; And now I just to get my point across
[1:09:19] after Jesus had risen from the dead. He
[1:09:22] walked with Cleopus and his friend
[1:09:25] speaking to them from the burden of the
[1:09:28] word of the Lord in the types and the
[1:09:31] shadows.
[1:09:33] He has no Bible, but they have the Old
[1:09:36] Testament, the Torah,
[1:09:39] and he has the types and the shadows.
[1:09:42] And so Jesus is is going walking with
[1:09:45] Calopus and his friend and saying, "Oh
[1:09:48] fools and slow of heart to believe all
[1:09:50] that the prophets have spoken." And
[1:09:53] beginning at Moses,
[1:09:55] beginning at Moses,
[1:09:58] he begins to declare and speak in all
[1:10:00] the scriptures of the things concerning
[1:10:04] himself.
[1:10:06] He's saying,
[1:10:10] are you listening? You are.
[1:10:13] He's saying, don't you know who's
[1:10:15] walking with you? Don't you know who's
[1:10:17] here now?
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Don't you know who's present? Don't you
[1:10:21] know who's resurrected?
[1:10:23] Here's what Moses said. Here's what here
[1:10:27] all the scriptures. Here's what they all
[1:10:29] said. And he speaks of himself. The word
[1:10:33] taking the word
[1:10:35] in shadow form
[1:10:38] and telling them
[1:10:41] it's fulfilled. Here it here it is. Here
[1:10:43] I am. I'm I'm alive. I'm rightly I'm
[1:10:46] right here with you. And uh I I spoke a
[1:10:50] whole message on this. And the Bible
[1:10:52] says, and you can read it in Luke 24.
[1:10:55] The Bible says,
[1:10:59] "And Jesus himself,
[1:11:02] drew near
[1:11:05] and went with them."
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Never forget that
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus himself, and I'm absolute
[1:11:12] confident, is in this Wednesday night
[1:11:15] service. That's right. and he's drawing
[1:11:17] near to somebody,
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; maybe drawing near to this congregation,
[1:11:22] and he's going to go with you
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; as an individual. I don't know where
[1:11:27] you're going to go, but he knows.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; And he's going to go with you.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Just hold that.
[1:11:40] Then Jesus got word.
[1:11:47] And listen friends, who's he working
[1:11:49] for? For us.
[1:11:53] I'm going to explain it to you. Listen
[1:11:55] very close.
[1:11:57] This scripture had to be scribed.
[1:12:00] Somebody had to scribe it. So he heard
[1:12:03] that Lazarus, his friend, was sick.
[1:12:06] very sick. And Mary and Martha had
[1:12:10] called for him. And the Bible says he
[1:12:12] loved Mary and Martha and Lazarus.
[1:12:15] And when he heard he was very sick and
[1:12:18] brother Brandham, you want to hear if
[1:12:20] you if you got if you got a the folio
[1:12:23] views from Voice of God, you can go and
[1:12:25] search it out. And he talks about Mary
[1:12:27] and Martha and and Lazarus and how Jesus
[1:12:31] was such a good friend of his of them.
[1:12:33] And he so he hears that he's sick.
[1:12:35] What's he do? He goes he waits two days
[1:12:41] and then he goes into Galilee
[1:12:44] with his disciples. He's going opposite
[1:12:46] direction.
[1:12:49] Says who who is this Christ? Who is this
[1:12:52] person? Who is this God? Doesn't even
[1:12:55] come when I call him. Who is this
[1:12:57] pastor? Who is this person? Who is this
[1:13:00] believer? Doesn't even come when I call
[1:13:01] him.
[1:13:05] and Lazarus died.
[1:13:10] It had to be written
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; that way.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; He was living out the written word of
[1:13:18] God before it was written
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; because we had to read the written word
[1:13:24] and see what he did. So that was the
[1:13:26] burden of the word. Do you think that he
[1:13:29] didn't have compassion?
[1:13:32] You're so quiet. And I'm glad you are
[1:13:35] because this has to reach down into the
[1:13:37] very depths of your soul to have a
[1:13:40] transforming power to it. Jesus, he had
[1:13:43] compassion. He knew that Mary and Martha
[1:13:47] are burdened, terribly worried
[1:13:51] about Lazarus, a friend of Jesus. He's
[1:13:55] not coming. He's not coming. And now we
[1:13:58] hear that he's gone into Galilee. And
[1:14:01] the disciples even said, "Why are you
[1:14:03] going into Galilee? They tried to stone
[1:14:05] you the last time." He's doing the
[1:14:07] opposite to what a normal mind would
[1:14:10] say. And we've got to get out of our
[1:14:13] normal way of thinking. That doesn't
[1:14:16] have anything to do with the eternal
[1:14:17] PLAN OF GOD. THY WILL BE DONE, oh God.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Whatever that might be.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; And you have to believe that God is in
[1:14:26] the midst.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; I I look across this congregation. We're
[1:14:30] all at different levels and in tears in
[1:14:32] life and some are students and some are
[1:14:35] newly married and some are mothers and
[1:14:37] fathers and some are on down the road.
[1:14:40] We all got a a different package. But we
[1:14:43] all are called to one thing to bear the
[1:14:45] burden of the word of the Lord to bear
[1:14:47] the testimony of Jesus Christ. And he's
[1:14:50] been revealed as the son of man.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; I know that that didn't get to you just
[1:14:57] exactly the way I want to.
[1:15:00] I gave you a quote the other day and the
[1:15:03] prophet of God is going way back into
[1:15:05] the beginning and he's saying he's
[1:15:08] saying that uh God you know he had
[1:15:10] attributes he was alone I'm giving
[1:15:12] different parts and pieces he was alone
[1:15:15] he was lonely even said he was alone and
[1:15:18] he thought saw himself as being a father
[1:15:22] he saw himself as having a family this
[1:15:25] was this was his attributes he saw
[1:15:27] himself as being the savior, but there
[1:15:29] was nothing lost. He saw himself as
[1:15:32] being a healer, BUT THERE WAS nothing
[1:15:34] sick. HE SAW HIMSELF AS BEING ALL OF
[1:15:36] THESE THINGS, but first and foremost, he
[1:15:39] wanted to be a father in order to be a
[1:15:41] father. And the prophet said, and I love
[1:15:43] this, where he said he loved fatherhood.
[1:15:47] I never want you to forget that phrase
[1:15:50] came out of the prophet's mouth from God
[1:15:52] himself. God is speaking it. He loved
[1:15:56] fatherhood. And the only only capital O
[1:16:00] the only way that he could express that
[1:16:02] is to become a son of man. So he became
[1:16:06] a son so he could express a father.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Oh I'm going to read some things out of
[1:16:11] the scripture to you. JESUS TALKING TO
[1:16:14] HIS FATHER. Father glorify thou me with
[1:16:18] the glory I had with thee before the
[1:16:21] world was.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:16:25] I JUST ABOUT WENT BALLISTIC when I read
[1:16:27] that again today. I'VE SEEN IT SO MANY
[1:16:30] TIMES, READ IT SO MANY TIMES, BUT IT
[1:16:32] TOOK THE PROPHET'S message to to give it
[1:16:35] its full embodiment
[1:16:38] said, "OH, THE PRAYER THAT HE PRAYED,"
[1:16:41] and it it's only in the prayer that he
[1:16:43] prayed uh that's recorded by by John the
[1:16:46] Apostle, who also was in the aisle
[1:16:49] called Patmas,
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; who said, "Your companion in the
[1:16:53] tribulation,
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; not the great tribulation, your
[1:16:56] companion in the burdens of life, your
[1:17:00] companion. It wasn't easy, but he ra he
[1:17:03] had to write it and scribe it and he had
[1:17:05] to live the two years there in Iowa
[1:17:07] Patmas so we would have the word of God.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; I feel I'm getting the point across. And
[1:17:16] so Jesus, he he terried these days about
[1:17:20] several days and then he comes
[1:17:25] he comes and says, "Where have you laid
[1:17:27] him?
[1:17:28] They said, "Come and see." And they
[1:17:29] brought him. And then they have the
[1:17:31] shortest verse in the Bible. Jesus wept.
[1:17:34] And they were all weeping.
[1:17:37] Jesus knew they were weeping. Jesus knew
[1:17:40] they were mourning.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Two two young ladies that he cared so
[1:17:44] much for and that ministered to him,
[1:17:47] Mary and Martha. What faithful women
[1:17:50] they were. and said Martha saying and
[1:17:52] even now I know whatever you ask the
[1:17:55] father he will give it to you
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; that kind of devoted love but he had her
[1:18:03] wait that had to be played out friends
[1:18:06] for you and I
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; I almost feel like we're spoiled kids
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; GOD PUT PEOPLE THROUGH SO MUCH
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; to write this WORD OF GOD FOR US THAT
[1:18:16] CARRIED SUCH A BURDEN for us surely we
[1:18:19] can carry a burden of the word of the
[1:18:21] Lord in this hour.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; OH, I SAY GOD, LAY IT ON US.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE A BUNCH A BUNCH OF
[1:18:28] WHIMPERING CHILDREN. WE'RE GOING TO BE
[1:18:30] MEN AND WOMEN THAT STAND UP AND SAY,
[1:18:32] "GIVE US A LOAD."
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Only we're NOT GOING TO BEND UNDER THE
[1:18:37] WEIGHT of the load of the revealing of
[1:18:40] the SON OF MAN. WHAT AN HONOR. WHAT A
[1:18:44] PRIVILEGE, LORD JESUS. WHAT A PRIVILEGE
[1:18:46] THIS IS TO BE ABLE to carry the load of
[1:18:50] the revealing of your son Jesus Christ.
[1:18:53] AND THAT WAS ONE OF YOUR GREAT
[1:18:55] ATTRIBUTES. YOU SO LOVE fatherhood that
[1:18:58] you HAD TO BECOME A SON OF man to show
[1:19:01] us what kind of person this is.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; So Jesus speaks of him of himself
[1:19:09] through the Old Testament types I gave
[1:19:11] you.
[1:19:14] And beginning at Moses and all of the
[1:19:16] prophets, he expounded unto them in all
[1:19:19] the scriptures the things concerning
[1:19:22] himself. That was the only way God could
[1:19:25] express himself as a father.
[1:19:31] Few more minutes, please.
[1:19:37] And Jesus
[1:19:40] answered them in John the 12th chapter.
[1:19:43] and saying, "The hour has come."
[1:19:47] See, he's he's he's progressing with
[1:19:50] life.
[1:19:52] The hour hadn't always come, but now the
[1:19:54] hour had come.
[1:20:02] I'm going to come to the bullseye just
[1:20:04] now.
[1:20:06] The hour has come.
[1:20:10] He's just getting ready for Calvary. The
[1:20:13] hour's come
[1:20:15] that the Son of Man should be glorified.
[1:20:22] I'm saying the You think he didn't know
[1:20:24] that the people were going to leave him
[1:20:25] by the thousands? He knew they were
[1:20:27] going to leave him.
[1:20:29] The hour has come
[1:20:32] where the Son of Man shall be glorified
[1:20:36] with spit all over his beard and his
[1:20:38] beard pulled out and a crown of thorns
[1:20:41] on his head and all of these things and
[1:20:43] gasp his last breath and die and hang
[1:20:46] his head into thy into thy hands do I
[1:20:50] commit my soul spirit.
[1:20:55] The hour has come.
[1:20:58] And Jesus had said just just prior to
[1:21:02] this, I'm the bread that came down from
[1:21:05] heaven. And that was too heavy for them
[1:21:08] to pick up and bear. And the Bible says
[1:21:11] that they were people were offended. And
[1:21:14] that's scandalized in the Greek. It's a
[1:21:18] scandal.
[1:21:20] They said and and the prophet of God
[1:21:23] says in this day he says they say is he
[1:21:27] some kind does he want us to be vampires
[1:21:29] you eat my flesh and drink my blood and
[1:21:32] they could go right back to the
[1:21:33] scripture and say it's written that is
[1:21:35] an abomination to God
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; where would we be
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; listen friends I'm talking very very
[1:21:43] serious where would we as a congregation
[1:21:45] be that's why we don't care what people
[1:21:49] pay or what people have to they're their
[1:21:52] their AUTHORITY IS SO MINUTE COMPARED TO
[1:21:55] A PROPHET OF God who says if if I'm a
[1:21:58] false prophet put it across my back if
[1:22:00] that doesn't happen exactly that way.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Shall I read it for you?
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:22:19] I challenge and anybody who's listening
[1:22:22] out on the internet or wherever this
[1:22:24] might go, I challenge them. I challenge
[1:22:27] you to come and and do one up on this.
[1:22:32] Just I'm going to read just one
[1:22:35] and let them have to come with a reality
[1:22:38] that's greater than this. And if they
[1:22:40] don't, let their mouths be silent
[1:22:42] forever.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; And let it be out of your mind forever.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; I don't even pay an ounce of attention
[1:22:51] to it. It is what it is.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; They'll have to answer for whatever
[1:22:56] conclusions they come to or however. To
[1:22:59] me, I see this as the beloved son of
[1:23:01] God,
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; carrying the weight of the world,
[1:23:05] carrying my sins, making a way and
[1:23:09] living out the word before it was even
[1:23:11] written so that the scribes could scribe
[1:23:13] it so that we would have a Bible and
[1:23:16] then see it fulfilled, fulfilled,
[1:23:17] fulfilled, and coming TO THE LAST DAY.
[1:23:20] AND THEN I WILL SEND YOU ELIJAH THE
[1:23:22] PROPHET before the great and terrible
[1:23:24] day of the Lord. And we have such record
[1:23:27] as we have here. I hold in my hand a man
[1:23:30] comes.
[1:23:32] He says, "Yes, sir, brother.
[1:23:35] You have trouble with arthritis." I want
[1:23:37] you to be very careful. Watch how he
[1:23:39] starts. Just a physical form, physical
[1:23:42] thing. You have trouble with arthritis
[1:23:46] is what bothers you. Isn't that right?
[1:23:49] Now, I just want to say before, and
[1:23:52] you'll have to understand me as a human.
[1:23:54] I read it to these brothers also. If
[1:23:57] this man came into this congregation
[1:24:00] wanting prayer, I would have to have a
[1:24:03] direct word from God to have anything to
[1:24:05] do with him.
[1:24:11] Now you will listen.
[1:24:15] And brother Brandham has to say, "Look,
[1:24:18] I want you to look this way."
[1:24:22] And he just and be just as sincere as
[1:24:24] you can.
[1:24:26] Life hasn't been a flower bed of ease
[1:24:29] for you, has it, brother?
[1:24:31] Had lots of sorrow,
[1:24:34] lots of trouble.
[1:24:36] You're in trouble right now, brother.
[1:24:38] Isn't that right? Now, he's standing in
[1:24:40] public.
[1:24:42] He sang it to the world. He sang it to
[1:24:45] us and we were re we're reading it
[1:24:48] tonight.
[1:24:50] He said, "You're in trouble right now,
[1:24:51] brother. Isn't that right? At one time,
[1:24:55] you wouldn't have come here in this
[1:24:57] prayer line.
[1:25:00] You was an unbeliever once, very much
[1:25:04] critical of religion. Isn't that right?
[1:25:09] You done a great thing along that time,
[1:25:11] too. Something that hurt you. I believe
[1:25:15] you you rebuked God or cursed with God
[1:25:20] or something or done something wrong or
[1:25:24] didn't you do that?
[1:25:26] How would you think brother by the
[1:25:30] spirit of God? Is that a tract
[1:25:33] concerning He talking about attract
[1:25:36] is that a track
[1:25:38] concerning it?
[1:25:41] All right.
[1:25:46] Now he says, "Now concerning that,"
[1:25:50] talking about the tract,
[1:25:53] a little tract, he said, "Now concerning
[1:25:55] that, it harmed you." Now being that you
[1:25:59] had that on tracks,
[1:26:03] that he had cursed God, rebuked God, and
[1:26:05] had cursed God. You had that on tracks.
[1:26:08] He said, "Then look this away.
[1:26:12] Believe with all your heart. You dearly
[1:26:15] paid for that, brother. You have lots of
[1:26:19] troubles now." Nervous.
[1:26:22] You have a lot of home troubles, too,
[1:26:25] don't you? Domestic troubles with your
[1:26:28] own home. Is that right? Will you
[1:26:31] believe me as God's servant? It's all
[1:26:34] right for me to speak what the Lord
[1:26:37] says.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; You've had other troubles too, don't
[1:26:40] you? Sexual troubles. Is that right?
[1:26:44] Sexual troubles. You listen that what I
[1:26:47] mean. Nobody but God alone knows that
[1:26:51] better than you. Is that right? You
[1:26:53] believe with all your heart. Now,
[1:26:55] brother, let me have your hand. Here's
[1:26:59] the prayer. He asked the people. Let's
[1:27:01] bow our heads. Our heavenly father,
[1:27:04] there's nothing but what you know all
[1:27:06] about it. I'm so thankful that you're
[1:27:09] here tonight. Blessing this poor old
[1:27:12] brother, having run and slept away to
[1:27:15] get out to service, but loves you in his
[1:27:18] heart. God, make a way for him. Grant
[1:27:22] it, Lord. He's in trouble. You said that
[1:27:25] you would be near those who were in
[1:27:28] need. God, bless my brother now as I
[1:27:31] bless him in thy name. May all these
[1:27:34] troubles clear up like a cloud leaving
[1:27:37] from before the sun. And may he be
[1:27:40] healed tonight of his arthus and all
[1:27:43] these other troubles, Lord, and may and
[1:27:47] and be made new and whole again in the
[1:27:50] name of Jesus Christ, the son of God, I
[1:27:53] ask it. Amen. And then he says,
[1:27:57] he takes more time with this man than he
[1:27:59] does with maybe three or four other
[1:28:01] people.
[1:28:03] He says, "Look here, brother. Let me see
[1:28:05] you.
[1:28:07] You feel that you're healed, don't you?
[1:28:10] You are healed, my brother. God bless
[1:28:12] you. And go on your way rejoicing and
[1:28:15] all your troubles are going to clear up
[1:28:17] now and be all right. God bless you."
[1:28:21] Then he says, "Can I have this?"
[1:28:24] Thank you. And it's attract.
[1:28:28] He says, "God who I stand before now and
[1:28:32] God attract here." And the title of it
[1:28:35] is in quotation mark, "Is there a God? I
[1:28:39] cursed him."
[1:28:42] And here's a God
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; in a man
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; carrying the burden of the word
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; to a man that most people wouldn't have
[1:28:52] in their church.
[1:28:54] Amen.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; But he he's you talk about a prophet,
[1:28:57] friends,
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; seeing way beyond to the man's heart and
[1:29:02] to see his sincerity and to see his need
[1:29:05] and to brush everything aside and starts
[1:29:07] out by telling him about arthritis and
[1:29:10] ends his prayer with his arthritis
[1:29:12] because that was the least important
[1:29:13] thing.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "Can I have this?"
[1:29:20] He says, "And God who I stand before now
[1:29:24] and got attracted here, is there a God?
[1:29:26] I cursed him." If God in heaven who I
[1:29:30] stand before knows I know nothing about
[1:29:33] that tract or anything about it and
[1:29:36] bring and being it was that I thought
[1:29:40] maybe when they seen the tract uh the
[1:29:44] Lord permitted to go right down into the
[1:29:46] depths of his heart and get something
[1:29:49] that's really a secret to tell. Jesus is
[1:29:52] the same yesterday, today and forever.
[1:29:55] You believe that Jesus that Jesus is
[1:29:57] still is is present right here. He can't
[1:30:00] change.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; That's his attributes. That is him.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; THIS SAME PROPHET WHO SAID THOSE THINGS
[1:30:08] HAS SAID TO us and you know God would
[1:30:11] reveal even more
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; and say even more. But even in this day
[1:30:16] and age, you know, we are almost we are
[1:30:19] we are educated. We are trained. We are
[1:30:22] built up that we all have rights and and
[1:30:25] there maybe be very few people that
[1:30:28] would stand on the platform and allow a
[1:30:31] man by the name of William Brandham to
[1:30:33] reveal what he revealed about that man's
[1:30:36] deep inner being because we are we're
[1:30:39] educated to the place that we we in our
[1:30:43] society where we have a right to hold
[1:30:45] these things. I'll tell you what, God
[1:30:47] has a right to expose it. God has a
[1:30:50] right to reveal these things. God has a
[1:30:53] right to speak it. And he says, "And I
[1:30:54] have a right to say it." And he says it
[1:30:57] and the MAN IS DELIVERED. WHAT IS MORE
[1:30:59] IMPORTANT? TO HOLD THE SECRET and be
[1:31:01] bound or to have it released AND HAVE
[1:31:04] GOD EXPOSE IT AND SAY, "I'M FREE."
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. ONCE I WAS A SINNER. I'M
[1:31:11] FREE.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; ONCE I WAS SICK, BUT I'M HEALED. PEOPLE
[1:31:16] TODAY DON'T EVEN WANT TO SAY ANYTHING
[1:31:17] ABOUT THEIR SICKNESS or anything else,
[1:31:19] you know, because they want to be
[1:31:21] PRIVATE ABOUT IT. I SAY GET IT OUT.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; LET GOD REVEAL IT. LET GOD WHATEVER
[1:31:27] WHATEVER IT TAKES.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; And then I'm going to close with this
[1:31:33] even though I'm not quite done, but I'm
[1:31:35] going to close anyhow. I'm going to
[1:31:37] close.
[1:31:45] Jesus had said, "Except you eat the
[1:31:46] flesh of the Son of Man and drink his
[1:31:48] blood, you have no life in you. Those
[1:31:50] who eate eatth my flesh and drinkkeeth
[1:31:52] my blood hath eternal life, and I will
[1:31:55] raise him up." Doesn't say that he got
[1:31:57] eternal life. Then he says, "He that
[1:31:59] does that has eternal life, and I will
[1:32:02] raise him up at the last day." And he
[1:32:05] said, "Therefore said I unto you, no man
[1:32:08] can come." That had to be spoken. He
[1:32:11] wasn't reading from a quote. He was just
[1:32:13] saying it because it had to become a
[1:32:15] quote.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; It had to become a scripture so that you
[1:32:18] could read it and you COULD BELIEVE IT.
[1:32:20] AND BY BELIEVING IT, YOU COULD BECOME
[1:32:22] THE RECIPIENT OF THAT SAME living
[1:32:24] Christ.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful, friends? ISN'T IT
[1:32:28] ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL? GOD'S PROGRAM THAT
[1:32:32] GOD KNEW THAT WHEN THAT LITTLE MYSTIC
[1:32:34] LIGHT CAME OUT from the bosom and the
[1:32:36] prophet said it was the son of God.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; And from that time, think of it. And
[1:32:46] from that time, many of his disciples
[1:32:49] went back and walked no more with him.
[1:32:52] You might say, "Well, you read that
[1:32:54] before." Yes, I did. It needs to be read
[1:32:56] again. And the load was too heavy for
[1:32:58] them when he said when he said those
[1:33:01] things except you eat my flesh and drink
[1:33:03] my blood. But he says that to the woman
[1:33:05] at the well. Uh if you knew who it was
[1:33:08] that was speaking to you, you'd ask me
[1:33:10] for a drink and I'd give you a drink of
[1:33:13] a everlasting water. You wouldn't have
[1:33:15] to come here and and and and be thirsty
[1:33:18] again. And brother Brandham, he in the
[1:33:21] first seal. No, please. I'm rushing, but
[1:33:24] don't don't don't don't
[1:33:26] let this escape you. In John the 12th
[1:33:28] chapter, he's reading John 12 and 23.
[1:33:32] Now, he said, "Listen here now, real
[1:33:35] close." So, I'm calling on you to listen
[1:33:39] now, real close. He is
[1:33:43] then you won't have to wonder no more
[1:33:46] what it is.
[1:33:49] And Jesus answering them, saying, "The
[1:33:52] hour is come that the son of man, son of
[1:33:56] man,"
[1:34:00] who's the result of the consequence of
[1:34:02] the attribute of God that was crying out
[1:34:06] of the eternal being for a release.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; It's a son of man to be glorified.
[1:34:15] He's going to conquer the deceiver of
[1:34:17] heaven.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO CONQUER LUCIFER.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING to re He's going to
[1:34:22] annihilate the the corruption and death
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; BY EVEN HIS OWN BODY WILL NOT CORRUPT
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; AND TO FULFILL THE SCRIPTURE. THERE
[1:34:31] WON'T BE A BONE OF HIS BROKEN.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say glory to God?
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; I WANT THIS CONGREGATION TO GIVE HIM
[1:34:37] PRAISE AND magnify him.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a savior. Amen.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; NO WONDER THEY WROTE THE SONG. OH, WHAT
[1:34:46] a savior.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; And he said, "The hour has come that the
[1:34:51] son of man should be glorified." He
[1:34:54] said, "See, you're at the end of of an
[1:34:57] age there. His ministry is ending." And
[1:35:00] the and the son of man, a son of man,
[1:35:03] revealing the son of man is coming now
[1:35:05] to the end of his age
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; and the end of his ministry.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; And then he goes on to say, "What about
[1:35:15] the hour
[1:35:17] that has come that when his bride must
[1:35:20] be taken away?"
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; What the hour has come that time shall
[1:35:28] be no more.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; And the angel is ready to set one foot
[1:35:32] on land and the other on the sea. That's
[1:35:36] the people.
[1:35:38] and with a rainbow, which is his
[1:35:39] promise, the covenant.
[1:35:42] God said, "I'll put my bow in the sky
[1:35:44] and it'll be a token to me when I see
[1:35:47] that bow." You see a rainbow, you say,
[1:35:49] "Oh, how beautiful is." That's God's
[1:35:52] God's token.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; And with a bow, rainbow over him with
[1:35:59] feet and say, "Time's run out." And
[1:36:02] besides that, he raised up his hand and
[1:36:05] swore that time would be no more. And if
[1:36:09] you look at the word, the time will be
[1:36:12] no more. It is the delay will be no
[1:36:14] longer. It won't be delayed for this
[1:36:17] revelation to come. And here it's going
[1:36:20] right to that scripture at the first
[1:36:23] seal because now he's going to go the
[1:36:25] first second through the seven seals and
[1:36:28] the questions and answers on the seal
[1:36:30] because God has declared I will not
[1:36:33] delay this revelation any longer. Time
[1:36:36] will be no longer. Everything's going to
[1:36:38] stop. I'm going to reveal this thing.
[1:36:40] Can you say amen?
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad you say, "Well, I've read
[1:36:47] the seals. I don't UNDERSTAND IT. OH,
[1:36:48] PRAISE THE LORD. I'm glad you can
[1:36:50] understand everything.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; I don't understand everything.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Don't look at me that way.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; You don't understand everything. I don't
[1:37:02] understand everything. But we can
[1:37:04] believe it.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Absolutely can believe it. And we must
[1:37:08] believe it.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Just let me finish. And besides that, he
[1:37:14] raised up his hand and swore that time
[1:37:16] shall be no more when this happened. How
[1:37:19] perfect it is. And then he declares what
[1:37:22] it is. Everybody's attention. A sworn
[1:37:27] affidavit to the church. And a sworn
[1:37:31] affidavit. This is this is what an
[1:37:33] affidavit is. How many don't know what
[1:37:36] an affidavit is? Raise your hands.
[1:37:39] That's what Don't be ashamed.
[1:37:41] All right. This is what an affidavit is.
[1:37:44] It's a written, sworn statement of fact.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; It had to be written.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; John the Apostle had to carry the burden
[1:37:58] of the word of the Lord.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Somebody had to scribe it.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Somebody had to translate it. Somebody
[1:38:06] had to carry that burden. Somebody We
[1:38:09] got a brother Wong up there. Brother
[1:38:11] Murphy Wong. No wonder he comes so under
[1:38:15] the power of God. He just lives in that
[1:38:18] every day. He just speaking that word
[1:38:20] every day. Think of it, friends. Think
[1:38:23] of it. Wouldn't that be wonderful to
[1:38:24] have that as your job? It just in it all
[1:38:26] the time. You may wonder why I'm so
[1:38:29] exercised cuz I've been doing nothing.
[1:38:30] I've been sitting alone and sitting with
[1:38:33] these words and pondering and seeing the
[1:38:35] scripture.
[1:38:37] What am I SUPPOSED TO DO? HAVE TO COME
[1:38:39] TO CHURCH AND SAY IT.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; SAY, "WELL, YOU YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SO
[1:38:44] EXCITED." YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M so excited
[1:38:46] about this. I'm more excited about this
[1:38:48] than the than the football or the NHL or
[1:38:52] the NBA or anything else. I'm more
[1:38:54] excited about this. WE'RE BEEN CALLED
[1:38:57] AND ELECTED. YOU YOUNG PEOPLE, I wish I
[1:39:00] were you. I wish I had the youth that
[1:39:03] you have to live this uh live this
[1:39:06] glorious life and revelation OF JESUS
[1:39:09] CHRIST. SAY, I'LL LIVE. THEY THEY LIVED
[1:39:12] WHAT THEY didn't even understand.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; I'LL SAY IT AGAIN. THEY LIVED EVEN WHAT
[1:39:17] THEY didn't understand. THEY JUST LIVED
[1:39:19] IT. GOD CALLED THEM TO GO PLACES. THEY
[1:39:22] WENT THERE NOT GOING, NOT KNOWING WHERE
[1:39:24] they went. They went BECAUSE IT HAD TO
[1:39:26] BE WRITTEN. YEAH. YEAH.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM HAD TO WALK BY FAITH BECAUSE IT
[1:39:31] HAD TO BE WRITTEN. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE
[1:39:33] he was going
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; and had trouble with Lot and the
[1:39:36] herdsmen and all those things. And he
[1:39:39] doesn't ask, you know, he doesn't say,
[1:39:41] "Oh God, oh God, I got all this trouble
[1:39:43] with Lot and HIS SERVANTS." THAT'S JUST
[1:39:46] INFATISIMAL.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean anything. What really
[1:39:50] meant something is God made me a promise
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; that I'll have a seed
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; and my seed will inherit this place and
[1:39:59] that had to be written because it's
[1:40:00] going to mean SOMETHING TO US. GOD HAD a
[1:40:02] seed.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; YOU WERE THAT SEED THAT SHOULD come
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; and THE PROMISE WILL CAR BE CARRIED WITH
[1:40:08] THE SEED. The fact that you're a son and
[1:40:11] daughter of God, you have inherited
[1:40:14] through Jesus Christ because that was
[1:40:16] the beloved son.
[1:40:19] Oh, I I'm having a hard time stopping.
[1:40:21] But this is what an affidavit is. It's a
[1:40:23] sw a written sworn statement of fact
[1:40:28] voluntarily made. God didn't have to say
[1:40:32] it, but he voluntarily said it by an
[1:40:36] individual under an oath administered
[1:40:40] administered by a person authorized to
[1:40:43] do so. And I say one thing, God sent the
[1:40:46] most authoritative voice. He didn't have
[1:40:49] to, but he knew this would be a a
[1:40:51] disbelieving generation. So he sent a
[1:40:54] prophet that you couldn't even squeeze
[1:40:56] around. And that's why he said thousands
[1:40:58] of times, is that the truth? Is that the
[1:41:01] truth? Because it was the truth. And in
[1:41:03] the in the spirit of truth, uh, a great
[1:41:06] part of it is my own testimony in there
[1:41:08] that brother's relating it. Brother
[1:41:10] Brandham's relating it. I say that is
[1:41:12] absolutely the truth.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Absolutely the truth. What he said is
[1:41:16] absolutely the truth. I don't have to go
[1:41:19] back and fix anything. It's absolutely
[1:41:21] the truth. And God, I'm getting across
[1:41:24] here and I'm ending now. And God lived
[1:41:27] it. He had men live their lives and
[1:41:30] women live their lives and family live
[1:41:32] their lives to lay down a script called
[1:41:36] the Old Testament. And then Jesus came
[1:41:38] and fulfilled that. Subjected himself to
[1:41:42] what man had written. Subjected himself
[1:41:44] because he knew it was come from God.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Holy men as they were moved by the Holy
[1:41:50] Ghost wrote and prophesied of the
[1:41:53] scripture. And then they had to live
[1:41:56] their lives. And Jesus lived his life.
[1:41:59] Jesus put people young ladies through
[1:42:02] agony and mourning with their brother
[1:42:05] dead in the tomb. made them go through a
[1:42:07] whole funeral and everything else so it
[1:42:10] COULD BE WRITTEN FOR US here in the end
[1:42:12] time. Hallelujah. Glory to God. And then
[1:42:17] to have a prophet say, if you only knew
[1:42:19] who this God is, WHO'S IN OUR MIDST
[1:42:22] TONIGHT. IT'S NOT TOMORROW, NOT NEXT
[1:42:24] SUNDAY, NOT LAST SUNDAY, but tonight. He
[1:42:27] knows exactly where you're at. He knows
[1:42:30] your deepest secret. He knows your
[1:42:32] deepest need. And many people they came
[1:42:35] up before brother Brandham one came up
[1:42:37] and he had epilepsy but he said that's
[1:42:40] not your real need. Your real need is
[1:42:42] that you're not born again. You not
[1:42:45] accepted Jesus Christ as your savior.
[1:42:48] And the man acknowledged that and he
[1:42:50] received it right then. Oh friends, what
[1:42:52] a gospel.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; What a message we have.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I say we are
[1:43:00] prepared. I say it in faith. We're
[1:43:04] prepared to bear the burden of the word
[1:43:06] of the Lord. This church has sought to
[1:43:08] do that. And I'm more determined myself
[1:43:11] now than I ever been my life. We're
[1:43:14] going to carry the burden of the word of
[1:43:15] the Lord. Hallelujah. It's always been a
[1:43:18] burden to get this prophet's word out in
[1:43:21] the languages of the people. That shall
[1:43:24] continue.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; That shall continue.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. that shall continue.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; We're obsessed with that. That's not
[1:43:36] just some works.
[1:43:39] That's not merely some works. That's
[1:43:41] what we do. That's who we are.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; I say, "Glory to God." And I want you
[1:43:47] people to pray for every person that
[1:43:50] even extends themselves in any way, any
[1:43:52] form, any shape. Whether it be to
[1:43:55] Seattle or Brother Kyle to Victoria or
[1:43:59] to somebody you've never seen or known
[1:44:01] before, it's one body. It's one bread.
[1:44:06] Whether they're in Africa or whether
[1:44:07] they're in China, whether they're in
[1:44:09] Poland or whether they're in Russia, it
[1:44:11] doesn't make any difference. Amen.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; I had a call first thing this morning at
[1:44:16] breakfast. Please come to uh Mexico
[1:44:20] City. Brother Ron Caldwell, I think I
[1:44:23] thought you put them up to it. That was
[1:44:25] brother Francisco.
[1:44:27] I said that sounds I told my wife I said
[1:44:29] I think that's brother Ron Caldwell put
[1:44:31] them put him up to that and probably
[1:44:34] gave him my home number.
[1:44:36] Anyway,
[1:44:39] that's fine. Brother Ron, they have a
[1:44:42] wonderful, this is 60th anniversary, 60
[1:44:44] years when Brother Brandham was in
[1:44:46] Mexico City, okay, this coming spring
[1:44:49] and they want they want to have a
[1:44:51] meeting. They have an annual meeting
[1:44:52] down there. But once more, this is this
[1:44:56] is our burden.
[1:44:59] It's just one of our burdens.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:45:04] Oh, I believe the true report.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that, shall we? Brother Ryan
[1:45:09] and Brother Nathan, you come up and help
[1:45:13] us sing it.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; I hope I haven't kept you too long.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. The whole theme is I don't know
[1:45:25] where the burden of the word of the Lord
[1:45:27] started but sometime before time
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; and then there wasn't much happening
[1:45:34] between Adam and Noah. But once Noah
[1:45:37] came, it was nothing but burden from
[1:45:39] then on. Amen. They lived it under types
[1:45:43] and shadows.
[1:45:45] They lived it all through Jesus. Lived
[1:45:46] it all through his time. Lived it all
[1:45:49] through the New Testament. And we're not
[1:45:53] going to say, "Well, I don't think I
[1:45:55] want to carry it." And we're not going
[1:45:58] to say going to say we're not going to
[1:46:00] be like I I read last Sunday, you know,
[1:46:02] where brother Pam says that ministers
[1:46:04] and their congregation sometime put the
[1:46:06] pressure on them and and then the
[1:46:08] minister bends under the load. He bends
[1:46:11] under it and you know gives in and then
[1:46:14] so on so forth. I'm glad you're not that
[1:46:16] way.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't feel any I don't feel
[1:46:20] anything coming from the people saying
[1:46:22] we want you to compromise. No. Father,
[1:46:24] furthermore, you want the people to know
[1:46:26] we don't want any compromise. You just
[1:46:29] continue to preach it straight. You'll
[1:46:31] preach us right into the rapture. Every
[1:46:33] man that stands behind this pulpit just
[1:46:36] preaching something and I'll obtain
[1:46:38] something. Even when you don't realize
[1:46:40] it, God's pouring it into you. Amen.
[1:46:44] Amen.
[1:46:45] Hallelujah.
[1:46:47] Better start singing, Brother Ryan, cuz
[1:46:49] I'm not going to stop preaching. Looks
[1:46:51] like
[1:46:53] I believe the true report. Let's stand.
[1:46:59] Hallelujah to the lamb.
[1:47:04] Oh, glory
[1:47:09] Jesus
[1:47:10] on the san.
[1:47:16] Heat. Heat.
[1:47:32] Hallelujah.
[1:47:35] Hallelujah.
[1:47:38] I'm living in praise.
[1:47:43] I sing and praise God. Hallelujah to
[1:47:49] my father.
[1:47:52] Glory
[1:47:54] to God. I feel
[1:47:58] I
[1:48:00] I know.
[1:48:04] Hallelujah.
[1:48:11] Hallelujah.
[1:48:22] Hallelujah.
[1:48:25] I am living in the presence of
[1:48:31] not just singing a closing song. That's
[1:48:33] not what we're doing. If we realize who
[1:48:36] is here,
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; this God that we've talked about is here
[1:48:40] present. Present now.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; And because you believe the word, the
[1:48:45] Holy Spirit
[1:48:47] is able to go right out into the
[1:48:49] congregation. And I read I read one the
[1:48:53] prophet of God is he's preaching uh the
[1:48:56] testimony he's preaching God revealed to
[1:49:00] his people then the testimony and after
[1:49:04] the day after he got the tract this is
[1:49:06] this is one day 13th 14th and 15th day
[1:49:10] after he got the tract said where is God
[1:49:13] I cursed him
[1:49:16] his title the next night is who is God.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; And when you get to the end of the
[1:49:24] service, I just I just scrolled down
[1:49:26] quick cuz I wanted to get to the end of
[1:49:28] the service. I knew that this God who's
[1:49:30] A LIVING GOD WHO is God. He's not going
[1:49:33] to leave the people with bamboozled
[1:49:36] their mind. He's going to come on THE
[1:49:38] SCENE. AND THIS GOD wants to you to
[1:49:41] know. HE WANTS TO COME ON THE SCENE more
[1:49:43] than you even dare to ask him.
[1:49:46] It'll come out into the into the
[1:49:48] congregation while you're singing and
[1:49:50] heal you. Something will start to move
[1:49:53] within you and you just say, "Do it,
[1:49:54] Lord. Do it, Lord. I'm here to receive
[1:49:57] from you."
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He had the people waving
[1:50:01] their arms and thanking God in
[1:50:04] expectation
[1:50:06] what he's going to do. Now, here's the
[1:50:09] scripture I wanted to read for you.
[1:50:10] These words spake Jesus and lifted up.
[1:50:14] Now the thing when I say Jesus just
[1:50:16] think of the son of man. The only way
[1:50:19] God
[1:50:21] could become a father.
[1:50:24] The only way is to become a son of man.
[1:50:29] And Jesus now he lifted up his eyes to
[1:50:31] heaven. This is John 17. The only time
[1:50:36] in this Bible
[1:50:38] that that prayer is recorded.
[1:50:41] I thank God somebody described it. Amen.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; I thank God somebody was listening and
[1:50:47] scribed it.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; And the hour has come. Glorify thy son
[1:50:56] that thy son also may glorify thee
[1:51:01] as thou hast given him power
[1:51:04] over all flesh,
[1:51:07] that he might give eternal life to as
[1:51:10] many as thou hast given him.
[1:51:13] And this is life eternal that they might
[1:51:16] know thee the only true God. Friends
[1:51:21] here at Cloverdale Bible Way if we in
[1:51:24] the ministry fail to make this God real
[1:51:27] to you that you might KNOW THAT THIS GOD
[1:51:31] IS YOUR FATHER. It's not just a phrase,
[1:51:35] but you know him and you can come before
[1:51:37] him and you can say, "Father, Father, if
[1:51:41] this sickness has been here to glorify
[1:51:43] thee, yet I believe thee for a complete
[1:51:47] healing, God bless you, Sister Heidi.
[1:51:50] God bless you, Sister Louise Wood. I
[1:51:53] tell you that this God
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; wants to heal these people."
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Do we as a people believe that?
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. and to go out the spirit of God.
[1:52:03] The spirit of God is the spirit of
[1:52:05] healing.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; You that need re revelation SAY I NEED
[1:52:09] TO I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND. May God go
[1:52:12] out in the congregation. Open up your
[1:52:15] mind and your understanding and help you
[1:52:17] to comprehend. I pray it. I had to pray
[1:52:20] it this week several times. I prayed
[1:52:22] earnestly. Oh God, help me to see this
[1:52:25] more clearly so I can say it and speak
[1:52:28] it to the people.
[1:52:31] And this is life eternal, that they may
[1:52:33] know thee, the only true God, and Jesus
[1:52:36] Christ, whom thou hast sent. Aren't you
[1:52:40] thankful that God sent a prophet to tell
[1:52:43] us exactly how out of the bosom of the
[1:52:45] father came the son of God?
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; I have glorified thee. on the earth. I
[1:52:57] have finished the work that thou gavest
[1:52:59] me to do. And now, oh father, glorify
[1:53:04] thou me with thine own self
[1:53:09] with the glory that I had with thee
[1:53:12] before the world was.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; There it is, brother Nathan.
[1:53:18] That answers it.
[1:53:22] before the world was with the glory that
[1:53:25] I had with thee before the world was.
[1:53:30] Now you hear it and you can see it from
[1:53:34] the message so clearly. We go back in
[1:53:37] little drama and we see this glorious
[1:53:42] light
[1:53:43] coming out from the father. This father
[1:53:46] that fills all time and space and in his
[1:53:49] bosom is to be a father. I am a father.
[1:53:53] I don't have a son. I am a father. I
[1:53:56] have children. And through Christ, he
[1:54:00] may bring many sons to God.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, I can't stop preaching BECAUSE I'M
[1:54:09] NOT SUPPOSED TO stop just yet.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Glorify thou me with THE GLORY THAT WE
[1:54:15] HAD. And friends, in the mind of God, in
[1:54:20] that great mind were all THE CREATION,
[1:54:23] EVERY FISH AND ALL the colors and all
[1:54:25] the plants and all the fruit and all the
[1:54:28] seed life. In that mind, but in there,
[1:54:31] in that mixture, there was I and there
[1:54:34] was you.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there was the son of God
[1:54:39] who would redeem us. And God says, "No
[1:54:42] matter what happens, no matter how dark,
[1:54:45] no matter how terrible the sin, I'm
[1:54:48] going to redeem them." Hallelujah. I'll
[1:54:51] bring the woman at the well. I'll bring
[1:54:53] the Moses who murdered a man. I'll bring
[1:54:56] them because THEY'RE IN MY MIND AND I'll
[1:54:59] pay the price for them and THEY ARE MY
[1:55:02] ELECTED SEED. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:55:06] HALLELUJAH.
[1:55:07] OH, glory to God.
[1:55:10] Help us, Lord, to accept all of that.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; I've passed the outer veil. All right,
[1:55:17] brother Nathan. We'll just finish now.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. But the blood has
[1:55:32] brought me in to God's holiness so
[1:55:36] clean.
[1:55:38] Sal
[1:55:40] hallelujah to the lamb.
[1:55:44] Hallelujah.
[1:55:47] Hallelu
[1:55:54] glory.
[1:55:56] Hallelujah.
[1:55:59] Hallelujah.
[1:56:02] I am living the rest of the
[1:56:08] heavenly father. I'm just coming now at
[1:56:11] the closing of this time together but
[1:56:14] not the closing of your presence with
[1:56:16] the people. You will walk with them as
[1:56:20] you did Lord Jesus with Cleopus. I say
[1:56:23] in the name of Jesus let it be so with
[1:56:26] every man and every woman. Let us go
[1:56:28] beyond the veil of this flesh. Let us
[1:56:31] see that it is Christ who draws near
[1:56:34] himself and goes with us. Goes with us
[1:56:37] in the automobile, goes with us to our
[1:56:39] home, is with us when we lay our head on
[1:56:42] the pillow. And I will never leave you
[1:56:45] nor forsake you, sayeth the Lord. Oh
[1:56:47] God, let it become more and more a
[1:56:49] reality. And when the brothers come to
[1:56:51] minister on Sunday, may this whole
[1:56:54] atmosphere be quickened. Father, go out
[1:56:56] among the congregation, oh God, with
[1:56:59] healing and with deliverance, and all
[1:57:01] manner of need shall be met in the name
[1:57:04] of Jesus Christ. And for the glory,
[1:57:08] for the glory of God, we thank you,
[1:57:11] Father, and we gladly bear this. We're
[1:57:15] privileged and honored to bear this
[1:57:18] burden of the word of the Lord in our
[1:57:20] age. We shall not sherk it. We shall
[1:57:23] move forward, Lord, with new vigor,
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; new energy.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; We thank you for the challenge of the
[1:57:31] word of God. Thank you, Lord, in Jesus'
[1:57:34] name. Heal everyone, oh God.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; There's a need of healing. Father, it's
[1:57:38] a simple thing for you to heal. Our
[1:57:41] sister Wood, we're thinking of her just
[1:57:42] now. Oh God, we've seen her here in the
[1:57:45] service. Our sister Heidi, oh God, our
[1:57:48] sister Heidi know neighbor. I pray,
[1:57:50] Father, that she will receive absolutely
[1:57:53] everything you have in store for her. We
[1:57:55] don't want to live here, Lord Jesus,
[1:57:58] without receiving the full benefit.
[1:58:00] Touch every person, Lord. Seeing our
[1:58:02] sister Deborah here, bless her, oh God,
[1:58:05] with blessings from on high in the name
[1:58:08] of Jesus Christ. Let us live in the
[1:58:10] glories, oh God. Let us live in heavenly
[1:58:13] places in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:58:16] Hallelujah. I want you to turn around
[1:58:18] and shake hands with a brother and
[1:58:21] sister near you and let them know
[1:58:23] there's another blood wat bloodbought
[1:58:26] bloodwashed saint beside them. Amen. God
[1:58:30] bless you, brother Nathan.
[1:58:43] Jesus name.
[1:58:45] Go. I'll I'll repeat what brother
[1:58:47] Brandham said so many times. Go and be
[1:58:49] happy.
[1:58:50] Hallelujah. You know what he says here
[1:58:52] in this who is this God? I can't even
[1:58:54] stop. He says, "You got a prayer card?
[1:58:56] Throw that up in the air. Throw it down
[1:58:58] on the ground. You don't need that
[1:59:00] prayer card. We don't need a piece of
[1:59:02] paper, friends. We don't need some aid."
[1:59:05] He said, "Just throw it up in the air.
[1:59:07] You don't need those prayer cards
[1:59:08] anymore." Glory to you, God. That's the
[1:59:11] kind of
[1:59:29] Pack it home. Glory to God.
[1:59:32] Amen.
[2:00:24] Heat. Heat.
