[Music] Hallelujah. I love him. I love him because he first loved me. I love you. [Music] See, [Music] my [Music] [Music] tree. &gt;&gt; Why don't you just slip up your hand right where you're at? Just speak personally to him this morning. Oh, I love you. Just close your eyes now. [Music] He love me [Music] [Applause] I s [Music] [Music] I wonder if we could whisper that to him just one more time. Oh, I love you. It's all about you, Lord. I love him.

His saving grace has not lost its power. Amen. Got a testimony from Sister Lori. Brother John had prayed for a man that was in the hospital, the serious crisis in his health. And now the man is on his road to recovery. Sister Lori is just writing in. We want to thank the Lord Jesus Christ for his healing power. Amen. Why don't we just go to prayer at this time? I ask brother Darren Hoffman, why don't you come and open the service in a word of prayer. Amen. I trust you enjoyed reading the feast of the trumpets and the seals causes a little revival in your own soul. But what that does is that puts the vitamins inside you. Now that quickening power can come and strike it, cause it to be energized in your body. You may not have understood exactly what you read, but this morning the dissolver is here. He can take that word and distribute it to every portion of the body that has need of it. Amen. Why don't we just join in prayer together this morning? Ask the Lord to have his way in this service. [Music] Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we are a thankful people this morning, Lord. For it's by your grace, Father, that we can stand here today knowing that we are bloodbought. We are washed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ. Nothing good of ourselves, dear God. We look to our own arm of flesh, dear God. We're nothing but failures, Lord. No good within us, Lord. But by your grace, one day, dear God, you came across our paths, Lord. And how we can look back, Lord Jesus, and know there's been a transformation in our lives. And what joy it brings within our souls, Lord. It gives us utterance, Father God, to praise you and to worship you, to exalt you, dear God, above everything else of this world, to exalt you above our own thoughts, our own ideas, Lord Jesus, our own reasonings, Lord. God, it just makes us want to cast down our burdens, cast down our cares, cast down our thinking, oh God, at your feet, Lord. Father, we could put on the mind of Christ, Lord Jesus. Lord, we want to be just like you, dear God. No, dear God, I know there's a song that says there's none like you, dear God. But Lord, I do know that there's a people, Lord, that are growing each and every day to be more like you. We're putting on our Eden beauty, Father. We're putting on Christ. We're putting on the word, dear God, that you've revealed to us in this day. And Lord, we're a blessed people. We're a privileged people, Lord. And we want to say thank you, dear God. Let not a day go by, dear Lord, in which we don't thank you, but let us open our mouths in praise and thanksgiving, Lord. Let it not become common to us this great salvation that you've brought in our lives. For truly you're worthy of it, for the lamb was worthy to take the book to loose the seals thereof to open up that book of redemption to us that we could see our names in it, dear God. that could re we could receive that revelation dear God that we are part of the bride of Jesus Christ that we have escaped from death hell and the grave that we can say oh death where is thy sting oh grave where's thy victory but Lord God you've given us resurrected life Lord Father nothing we could do Lord no man no prophet Lord but you yourself came down in this hour dear God to take the book Lord and Father we're praying that you'll take your word today, Father, that you'll break it to us. Lord, we come hungry tonight, Lord, this morning. We come thirsty, Lord. We come in anticipation, Father, for what you're going to speak to us today. Lord, we're thinking of our pastor, Lord, and how he so desires to find the mind of Christ, Lord. So desires to get himself out of the way, Lord. Father, may you come and set him aside, Lord. Set us aside, Father, and let the Holy Spirit move from heart to heart this morning, Lord. We're a desirous people to move, Lord Jesus, closer to you, to walk on farther, Lord, to make footprints, Lord, in our promised land. For footsteps means possession, Lord. We want to possess every promise, Lord, laying in the word for us, Father, to grab a hold of it, to embrace it, to not let it go, dear God, until Lord Jesus, you bring it to pass in our lives, Lord Jesus, we pray for your people this morning. Every need, Lord, every uplifted hand, Lord, every unspoken prayer request, every person needs a healing in their body needs healing within their soul needs that new birth. Father, Lord, come come down this morning, Lord Jesus. Move amongst us. Make yourself known in each of our lives, Father, to know you as life eternal, Lord. Lord, we don't want to know just a a like a a dead word, Lord. But we want a living Christ, a living word, not a dead letter, Father. A living word that's living out through these vessels, dear God. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we can walk humbly before you this day, Lord, knowing that it's a late hour, Father. and we need to do all that we can to lay aside, Lord, every hindrance, everything that would hinder our walk with you, Lord. So, Father, we open up our hearts to you this morning, Lord Jesus, praying that you will be welcomed in our midst as we wait upon you, Lord. We just ask your blessings upon each one, Lord. Remember those overseas, Brother Murphy, Brother Ivan, Lord, ministering in China. We think of the saints in the Philippines, Lord. God, how they're in such need of you, Lord. We just pray that you will meet every need they have, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, bless your people. We pray, Lord, as we just wait in anticipation, Lord, in the edge of our seats, Lord, expecting you to do something in our lives this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes, Father. &gt;&gt; We appreciate you, Father. &gt;&gt; Lord, in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may have your seats. Sister Jessica Caldwell, I believe. Is that right? Yeah. She's got a special for us. So maybe she can come and get ready. And right after she sings, the choir's going to come and sing for us. I have a couple of quick notes. We have a baptism right after the service. So that means the pool is open. Waters are ready. Amen. And we don't want to wait until after the service to let you know that you can be preparing all the way through the service. If you haven't made that step, that's a wonderful step to take. The Lord can come and do mighty things, but he first desires that we take that step. Amen. We've going to be going to two services starting next Sunday. So, if you missed that announcement, two services starting next Sunday and Sunday evening next week, we'll be having footwashing and communion here at the church. There will be a joint young people's meeting and young adults Friday the 23rd. So make sure that you're here for that. And one quick announcement from Bible way Christian Academy. Uh last year we had the J brothers. I believe it was here and we were able to enjoy their ministry and song and uh how the Lord has used them over the years and this year they've been able to uh work with the Cochman family. So, anyone that needs information on them, they're going to be here November the 7th. So, not a whole lot of notice. That's my fault. I didn't get the message out here to you uh when I had it probably three or four services ago, but there is information on the bulletin board outside of the school office and I I believe outside of the church office if you need to get that. Amen. You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; God bless you. [Music] All who sail the sea of faith find out before too long how quickly blue skies can grow dark and gentle winds grow strong. Suddenly fear is like white water pounding on the soul. Still we sail on knowing that our Lord is in control. Sometimes he calms the storm with a whispered peace be still. He can settle any sea but it doesn't mean he will. Sometimes he holds us close and lets the wind and waves grow wild. Sometimes he calms the storm and other times he calms his child. He has a reason for each trial that we pass through in life. And though we're shaken, we cannot be pulled apart from Christ. No matter how the driving rain beats down on those who hold to faith, a heart of trust will always be a quiet peaceful place. Sometimes he calms the storm with a whispered peace be still. He can settle any sea, but it doesn't mean he will. Sometimes he holds us close and lets the wind and waves go wild. [Music] [Applause] Sometimes he calms the storm and other times he calms his child. Sometimes he calms the storm with a whispered peace be still. He can settle any sea, but it doesn't mean he will. Sometimes he holds us close and lets the wind and waves go wild. Sometimes he calms the storm and other times he calms his child. [Music] Sometimes he calms the storm and other times he calms his child. [Music] [Applause] Amen. The choir's going to come and bless us with a song this morning. Maybe they could come and get ready. Uh there was one announcement that I neglected to uh mention to you, but it was brought back to my memory. There is a uh Thanksgiving family gettogether at Mount Baker Bible Way Camp this year. I believe Brother Ron and Sister Star Caldwell will be organizing that. So, accommodations are available and uh it's a potluck. Bring whatever you like. 1:00 on Thanksgiving Day on the US side. Amen. Help me sing this song this morning. So I'm casting all my cares on you. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. He's alive and he's coming back for you and me. Let's sing it again. Yeah. [Applause] Heat. is the story for my redeemer And he's coming back for you and me. [Music] [Music] You may feel down and feel like God has somehow forgotten [Music] that you are faced with circumstances you can't get through right now. It seems like there's no way out and you're going under. But God's proven time and time again he'll take care of you. [Music] He'll do it again. He'll do it again. Do it again. He'll do it again. Just take a look at where you are now. And where you been? Hasn't he always come through for you? &gt;&gt; He's the same now as then. Don't you know God cannot fail? &gt;&gt; You may not know how. You may not know when, but he'll do it again. God knows the pain that you're going through. And he knows how you're hurting. [Music] You see, he knows just how your heart has been broken in two. But he's the God of the stars and of the sun and of the sea. And he is your father. He can calm the storms and find a way to fix it for you. And he'll do it again. &gt;&gt; He'll do it again. He'll do it again. If you just take a look at where you are now and where you been, he always come through for you. He's the same now as then. Don't you know God cannot fail? &gt;&gt; You may not know how. You may not know when. But he'll do it again. Oh, he's still God. still. Oh, he's still gone and he will not change. Oh, I know that he's gone and he's fighting for just like Moses. Like just like Daniel just like Shadrach Me. He'll do it again. He'll do it again. If you just take a look at where you are now and where you been, why hasn't he always come through for you? He's the same now as you know. You may not know how. You may not know when, but he'll do it again. And you may not know how. You may not know how. &gt;&gt; And you may not know it. May not know. You may not know how. You may not know it. But I'm glad he'll do it again. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Amen. Let's stand together, friends. [Music] Hebrews 13:8 says he'll do it again because he's already done it once. &gt;&gt; Can't break his pattern. When the man of God steps to the pulpit this morning, there's something inside of you that can pull on the gift that's within him that will bring God on the scene. Let's just sing this chorus together as our pastor comes this morning. Holy, holy, [Music] all things are possible. [Music] [Music] All [Music] things are possible. Oh, Lord I Lord I [Music] Lord I [Music] glor Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] and all things are possible. [Music] Lord, I &gt;&gt; receive it in your heart now. Lord, I receive Lord, I receive all possible. Lord, I receive. [Music] Lord, I receive. [Music] How we appreciate your grace, Lord. Lord God, &gt;&gt; just as our pastor comes, Jesus is here. Oh, Jesus is here. [Applause] Jesus Christ is [Music] Jesus is [Music] my Jesus. [Music] All our [Music] Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; Isn't that the wonderful part? &gt;&gt; You're here. &gt;&gt; I'm here. That wouldn't mean a whole lot if he wasn't here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We mean that from the depths of our heart. We want him in all of his not all of his beauty only, but with all of his power, his wonderful supernatural working power. And uh I want to have I'm just going to break from the normal uh format of reading the service. So, I'm going to ask our brother David to come. Our brother David has been uh uh afflicted with an ongoing uh difficulty, affliction, and sickness. And uh we're going to pray for him right now. We're going to lay hands on him &gt;&gt; and we're going to believe that Jesus is here &gt;&gt; and that it won't only be our hands. And as and and as weakened as he is from time to time, he never fails to stand at the post of duty. And I I haven't only seen that, but God has seen that. And God has great respect for it. And I want to say to David's parents, I as soon as I I I've had brother David on my heart for a few days and he just passed by in front of my car and my wife and I began to speak and I just felt he really needs our prayers. He needs the combined force of faith &gt;&gt; of the body of Jesus Christ. I hear the prophet crying out when the people are beginning to rejoice and believe God. And he says there just a whole the whole congregation is just a milky wave over the congregation because it's a faith bank. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I believe in this God. &gt;&gt; And I believe in that faith bank. &gt;&gt; I believe in the promises of God are yay and amen to them that believe. And I believe that this affliction has no business in this body. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I ask you to stand. I know that you will stand with us in prayer at this time. And uh I'm going to also uh have our our brother Jean Jacques. I wonder if you would come also if you would just come also join us to lay hands. Yesterday was the anniversary of brother Jean Jacques being struck down. It was their anniversary, their wedding anniversary yesterday. 39 years on their 38th anniversary. He knew nothing about it. He was struck down, never came to consciousness in the morning. A man happened to find him. Paramedics broke in uh and and carried him to the hospital. He knew nothing for the next number of days until I I can see a great faith in his wife, Sister Marinette, and faith in the people that believed and prayed. And some days later, when the doctors had already given up hope, his son walked in to the hospital bed from a total unconscious state for days. And he said, he greeted his father. Hello, father. And he opened his eyes and greeted his son and then greeted the doctor after that. And with menitis completely covering his brain and a menitis which they physician said cannot dissipate out of the body. There's no way for it to dissipate out of the body. God raised him up. And our sister Marinette who stands here said to the medical team and to the specialists, "Have you ever seen this kind of case before?" He said, "Yes, we have." Have you ever seen one walk out of the hospital? They said, "No, we've never seen that." &gt;&gt; God's still God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I want to say to brother Blair and sister Rebecca, they can expect to have a son healed. &gt;&gt; I'm going to anoint him with oil. Let's bow together. Let's sing Only Belief. [Music] Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; How satan you try to shorten your life even keep you awaken. We come in the name of Jesus Christ. We come in the glorious one who has been revealed in this time. You have spoken through your prophet Messenger. You have said in your word and those words are flowing through us right now. We hear your words, Lord, they're flowing through us. Whatsoever things you ask, whatsoever things you ask, I will do it that the father may be glorified. Only believe all things are possible. Father, we resist the enemy. We resist Satan. We resist you disease and call for you to be corrected. We call for the chemistry to be made right. We call for the same God to raise up our brother Sha John that you shall raise up David also for your glory and that he might Lord Jesus be such an example as he has been use his testimony use his words oh God use his mouth anoint him I pray father and rid his body in the name of Jesus of every affliction every infection oh God we will give you glory we thank Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Jesus, touch me. &gt;&gt; Cause him to be of great glory to your name, &gt;&gt; glorify him, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. Let this virus depart. &gt;&gt; They shall die now in the holy presence of the almighty God. &gt;&gt; They shall come to nothing. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Who else might be afflicted in the congregation? Why don't you raise your hands and we're going to pray together. Almighty God, creator of heavens and earth and giver of every good gift. How wonderful you are, master, Lord Jesus. Thank you for paying the price. Thank you for Calvary. Thank you for the sacrifice. Thank you for the words that are going through this building right now. It is finished. Thank you for the words that are going through us right now. Oh God, and our faith channel picks it up. It is finished. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We say to this people, be healed. The Lord God is our healer. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I am the Lord that health thee. All thy diseases. &gt;&gt; Glory, glory. And now we give you praise. &gt;&gt; As your messenger said, now we just praise him. We give him thanks. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; We worship. We worship you in spirit and truth. Hallelujah. Glory. Glory to your name. Glory to your name. We worship thee Lord. Give you praise. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. We worship thee in spirit and in truth. We worship thee in spirit and in truth. [Music] [Music] We worship you. Heat. Heat. [Music] We worship you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. May God bless each one of you. We're going to be turning to the word while you're still standing. I I was so affected uh Sunday before last when I was speaking to you on the word is nigh. I was going to speak on part two of that but I feel uh just to an extension in a certain direction but there was one quote and I didn't get to read it. I was looking for it. I didn't get to read it. I perhaps spoke I spoke from it but I was thinking of our individual lives. Our homes are all different. Our concerns are different. Our connections are different. But I want to say to this congregation by way of an instruction and I believe this instruction with all that is within me. That is whatever situation we find ourselves in, whatever burden you are bearing at this time or whatever whatever situation may confront you, this is my un unequivocal counsel to you. Brother Brham is speaking of the transforming power of God that's transmitted by the Holy Ghost into your heart which has changed your nature your making and it made you another person. Now he's laying out a principle. He said you may not have felt and he breaks it off. You may not have felt it happening. You see, he said, "I don't know about that, but it's here anyway." &gt;&gt; And whether you're feeling it, whether you feel you say, "Oh, I have such questions. I have such burdens. I have such things I'm experiencing. I want to announce to you on the authority of the words of almighty God sent through Elijah the prophet that the answer is actually going through this building at this moment. &gt;&gt; And he goes further and says it's going through you. &gt;&gt; You have to have the crystal of faith &gt;&gt; to pick up that answer. And then he said you must say yes to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I I I'm I'm just taking some very basic and comprehensive words. God's messenger has been sent for an answer for every situation. There is none that go unanswered. What we need to do is catch the answer from that messenger. It's already here. And he says the he says the word of God and he refers to the message as the revealing of the word of God. It is actually God's word to you and me. &gt;&gt; Do you accept that? &gt;&gt; And it is going through us, it is going through this building. And so I urge you as you are pondering and as you read the messages and as God gives you puts a message right in front of your eyes. My wife was just visiting in a home the other day in a in a in a fellowship celebration. It was and and for Sister Lorie Snow, God bless you. And and and there was a message pile of message books just there and she just took the top and just opened it up and the very words her eyes just laid on the very words and just those words just began to minister to her. But I'll tell you why. You know why? because the the the words described exactly what was in her heart and she just began to say yes &gt;&gt; to it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Now, this may sound too simple, &gt;&gt; but he said, "I can prove that to you right now that there's radio coming through you &gt;&gt; and there's television pictures coming right through you. You don't feel it, but it's there anyhow. &gt;&gt; I want you to accept that. &gt;&gt; Please, as your brother, you accept that &gt;&gt; there's radio waves going through you. There's pictures and television going through you. He said, and it's sweeping through this building. He said now if our body was mechani ma me magnetized to that like the big word yes he said stretched out here from window to this side to window it's sweeping through this building yes going right through you somebody saying yes on the radio well it comes right through you and as it goes through you them powers electronics and so forth as it goes through your body. Now, when it hits against the crystal, he said on the set, it just catches like that and you hear. Yes. Now he said if God up there said by his stripes &gt;&gt; you were healed. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost entwined [Applause] &gt;&gt; and brings that down by the power of God &gt;&gt; and your heart set on that and it says yes &gt;&gt; and by his stripes you are healed. God said it in Mark, "Whatsoever things you desire, what is your desire as you stand here today in this meeting?" We don't want to have just church. We want to see God come and minister and answer to you individually. I want to minister to you as an individual. And God wants to, he's your father. &gt;&gt; And said, "Lord, we prayed for a meeting." He said, and he said, "We've prayed for a meeting. We've been fasting for a meeting. We've been crying for a meeting. Yes, Lord. I believe the meetings on the road. &gt;&gt; He said, "Then stand there." Here's his instructions. These words are penetrating me. They're going through me. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; And I have a I have a magnet of faith &gt;&gt; that has laid hold of them. And he says, "Then stand there." Like, oh, the power of God comes down. When it hits it says yes. And the next man says yes. He says uh look he said you've got double power. Yes. Yes. Triple power. Four times the power of yes. And the first thing you know it becomes thousands of powers of yes. He said then the Holy Ghost moves in. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you've got a unity. You've got a oneness. All in the same mind. The same mind saying yes. Yes. Yes. To the word of God. The message of the hour. I want to say to you today before it even start. The message of the hour is penetrating your being at this moment. And you all you need to do is acknowledge it, accept it, regard it. It is even scientific. But more than scientific, it's spiritual. &gt;&gt; And I say yes, oh Lord. Yes. I say yes to your will and your way. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have we got some time for the word now? &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. &gt;&gt; Let's have a meeting. &gt;&gt; Take your Bible if you would and we turn to Luke's Gospel uh chapter 21. I'm going to read from verse nine. But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified, for these things must first come to pass, but the end is not by and by. Then said he unto them, "Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and great earthquakes shall be in diverse places, and famines and pestilences, and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven." &gt;&gt; I have two other scriptures. We'll just read. Go back to Luke 16 and the 16th verse. and the law and the prophets where until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached. &gt;&gt; So now I we have a time frame here and then I will turn to Matthew 11 and the 12th verse. And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice if you would please once again and from the days from the days of John the Baptist &gt;&gt; until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force. &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats. I want to draw your attention and have you think this this will take some concentrated mental effort on your part. I want to speak to you on the the in between time. The in between time. And as you think about that, I will try to define it for you as quickly as possible. There are in between times that are uh really quite easily to distinguish because they're large. You could say as the scripture says, once I was young, now I am old. Uh well that's no mystery and that's an in but there's a lot that's happened from the time that you were young to the time that you got older. But within that span of time there are also periods of of very significant change. They speak of going, you know, from childhood when you reach into adulthood and it's kind of a mysterious time and young fellow's voice changes and and uh you know they become manly and they have certain things taking place in their body and the young girl is no longer just like a child anymore. It just seems in such a short space of time she comes in to become a young lady and it happens so quickly. And those are those are spaces of time uh in between time within the overall span of of time. Spiritually speaking, we have a events that uh that change and and uh events that change uh within a short period of time. And we we read the scriptures uh uh from the days from the days of John the Baptist now prior and the Bible says that the law and the prophets. So we have that great span of time. the law and the prophets were until John. And then since that time, the gospel is preached. And then when uh and then when the gospel began to be preached, it was a great flurry of events. John preached, John was put in prison, John was beheaded, Jesus was already on the scene. And the Bible says Jesus began to preach. John just introduced him. Jesus began to preach. He's only three and a half years of preaching and he's going to the cross and the crucifixion and the and the burial and the resurrection and 50 days later the Holy Spirit has fell on 120 people and begin to shake that nation and word is filtering out. So now we come to an in between time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In between the law and the prophets. We often refer to Malachi 4 5 and 6. Oh, Malachi 4 and we we see a prophet's ministry, but Malachi 4 actually involves a tremendous amount of events. And quite frankly, friends, I want to say to you, you and I are not living in a just an average time space of time. &gt;&gt; We're living in a very unusual space of time. And we need to be so much more alert, &gt;&gt; so much more conscious &gt;&gt; of the time that we're in. And that's really the purpose of my message this morning. And I'd like to take two or three things that uh just to expand our our thoughts this morning on uh things that are in between. Brother Brandham, he speaks. He says, "When I'm out, I'm out on missions and my wife writes a letter and I love her and she loves me." And she'd say, "Dear Bill, tonight I just put the children to bed and I've worked today." He said, "I see what she's writing, &gt;&gt; but I see." He said, "So I love So I love her. I can read between the lines &gt;&gt; and I know what she's talking about. &gt;&gt; She doesn't don't have to tell me. &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; So now it's something that she's not declaring it. She's not saying it plainly. It's essentially a secret. But he picks the secret up. &gt;&gt; He catches it. &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's the way it is with God. We're not trying to study from some newspaper standpoint. some theological standpoint. And it isn't even that we take a message and try to dissect it and that put it and connect it together and and cause it to mean a certain thing because we don't have a special agenda. We we cannot have a particular agenda of our own. What we need to do is flow into what he had in his mind and get into God's agenda &gt;&gt; and say yes to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he said, "But I fall in love with him and get down and really get him into your heart, &gt;&gt; the love of God shed abroad in our own heart by the Holy Ghost. Then go reading the Bible and you'll see it'll come out. It's coming right out between the lines and you know what he's saying." He never said that right out in a word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham in I think the unveiling of God, he says, "You can't see it, say it right out." &gt;&gt; But but he says it in such a way so that the people catch a hold of it. &gt;&gt; Jesus thanked the father that he hid those things from the eyes of the wise and the prudent. So now no one else could read my wife's letters like that. &gt;&gt; No, they could. What he's saying is they could read exactly the same words but they wouldn't get what he gets out of it. &gt;&gt; And he says they couldn't read it like that because he says because I love her that way. &gt;&gt; There has to be. So the understanding of the message is really based upon a relationship with the author. I'm talking about a real living relationship, &gt;&gt; not something I go to a certain church or I prayed at an altar or somebody prayed with me. It's not even that. It's not even that. It's not even who who's ministering the word first and foremost. It's your personal relationship with him. And that relationship is not something that is mysterious or difficult. It is something that should be on a continual basis. you're in in this morning or whatever it is you're doing. You can be you can be in prayer in a prayerful when you sisters are standing washing dishes &gt;&gt; when you're sweeping the floor and say, "I'm I'm I'm serving my home. I'm serving my family. Oh Lord, I just do this with joy." And even though maybe I'm burdened today, I've got things on my heart today, but I know that you're the answer. Send words from your messenger. Send words from your word and let them penetrate through me. I have I have something inside that'll pick it up. &gt;&gt; So love enables a person to know what has not been written &gt;&gt; or declared. And so now in this in between time there's an in between time between when a promise is given and when the promise is fulfilled. It might be a short period of time. It can be a very long period of time in between the time the promise was given to Abraham said you'll have a son. He was going to have Isaac. Brother Brandham says this, "But Ishmael was born in between that time." Ishmael was born in between that time, but it didn't take away. I said, "God said, I'll I'd have this boy and then call his name Joseph." And brother Brandon was talking about the promise that been made to him. And in between that time, he had a girl. &gt;&gt; But he said it still didn't change. And so somebody said to him, "Well, maybe it's supposed maybe maybe it was Josephine." No, he said it's not. He wouldn't be moved from that. No, it's not Josephine. Not Not because my wife had a girl. That doesn't change it. Says in between the time God gave Abraham and said, "You're going to have a son." And he has Ishmael. Says that's not it. But Isaac's still coming. &gt;&gt; So there is in between time. You may say, "Well, we've been promised certain things. I'm looking for the answer and now this happens or this comes into my life or something else which it seems that it's contrary to what the promise was. Don't worry, it can't it may delay things or in your mind uh may change the expectation. But let me say this. Whatever God promised, that's exactly how it's going to be &gt;&gt; in spite of ourselves. &gt;&gt; In Corinthians, it says, "But when that which is perfect has come, &gt;&gt; then that which is in part has done away." And the prophet declared, "And that which is perfect has come." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it doesn't mean that we're living in the fullness of it, &gt;&gt; but it has come. &gt;&gt; There's places in the message where I think that sometime it trips people up a wee bit and it has to do with uh I I have quotes that says the bride is sealed. &gt;&gt; It it doesn't mean that it's completely fulfilled. In other words, the word there is no further word coming to seal the bride. &gt;&gt; The sealing is done by a sealing angel. &gt;&gt; And it's not it's not that it's the church is called. It can be called. There's been there's people here when that was spoken, you weren't born yet, &gt;&gt; but you were born with a call on your life. &gt;&gt; You were called. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're predestinated to it. &gt;&gt; And Paul goes on to say, "When I was a child, I spake as a child." Now, we're talking about a time frame. When I was a child, I spake as a child. I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But when I became a man, I put away childish things. Put away childish things. Didn't put away what he was as a child. didn't put away, you know, he he he couldn't undo the things that he did as a child. You do foolish things as a child. He he couldn't change that. But and and when you're a child, I've thought a lot about this. You know, when you're a child, it's amazing for a son and daughter of God. Even what you experienced as a child, when you get older and mature in spiritual things, you'll find out that God's hand was even in that &gt;&gt; even in that background. &gt;&gt; And he was he was molding you and shaping you for where you are today. &gt;&gt; And now you can look back and say, "It seems so strange at the time, but now I understand it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When I was a child, I speculate. So the time between those and now we have as I read the scripture the time between John and the kingdom of God being preached. And then John the Baptist came at the end of the law and the prophets. the law and the prophets were until John. And then since that time, Jesus is saying now there's another era. Since that time, the kingdom of God is preached and every man &gt;&gt; presseth into it. &gt;&gt; So, a new era happened &gt;&gt; and something that wasn't on the people before John preached now came on them. Yeah, &gt;&gt; there was no uh there was no nothing to initiate them pressing into something. &gt;&gt; It was the law and the prophets, the law and the prophets until John. And then when John came, behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin. There's one among you who laugh at I'm not worthy to undo. He will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire. And those things, those words meant something to some people. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they heard about it &gt;&gt; and it set up. They had a crystal. &gt;&gt; They had something that was magnetized &gt;&gt; and they couldn't forget that word and it hung into them and they began to press &gt;&gt; into this kingdom. &gt;&gt; And the violent took it by force. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're not sitting back here in a relaxed state, my brother, sister, just waiting for something to fall out of the heavens. the violence and we take it by force. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God has been preached. &gt;&gt; The law and the prophets were until John and since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man pressth into it. And then it goes on to say and from the days of John. Now it said the law and the prophets were to John. Now this next scripture is and from the days of John the Baptist until now. &gt;&gt; So now Jesus is taking a season within a season. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He's taking a season within a season. Not a great big span of hundreds of years of the law and the prophets where until John. Now we're going and from John &gt;&gt; the kingdom of God is preached. And he says, "And then from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence." Well, something happened now from that time to this time. Events were unfolding. &gt;&gt; How many people knew about it? Maybe not a whole lot. Maybe not everyone was aware of it, but something comes over them and the violent take it by force. The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. These weren't people that were sitting back in a whole humb state and just having some empty profession. These were people who were aggressive about what they believed in. They were zealous about what they believed in. They're ready to speak about it. Whatever was made real to them, this was a reality to them. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. I like to think of believers as being a different breed and class of people in the world today. &gt;&gt; They have something of they have a strength the world knows nothing about. They've got convictions the world knows nothing about. We're not here to take the easy road. We're here to take the road of righteousness and truth and the right way. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm absolutely thoroughly convinced of it. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he says that the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, but Jesus said that the kingdom of God is preached. And he says, "And neither say and neither shall they say, lo here or low there, for behold the kingdom of God is within you." So now the scripture says and from the law and the prophets were until John and then from John the kingdom is preached and Jesus comes on the scene and says that kingdom is within you. &gt;&gt; So we can simply conclude how did the kingdom get within you? By the preaching &gt;&gt; of the word for that hour &gt;&gt; the kingdom of God &gt;&gt; actually was established. &gt;&gt; You can't make those words mean anything else. So what are we saying? We're actually going back to a prophet's words in this day. Those words actually penetrated those people. &gt;&gt; They didn't have television. They didn't have radio. They knew nothing about the science. It it it's proven to you in a way that God didn't even show them back there. We we're a scientific people. We're a pushb button people. We're an instant people. We we have such high expectations for our living standard. and so on. But back there Jesus is saying that John came preaching the kingdom of God. And then he came on to say and that kingdom was in the hearts of the people. And the prophet comes and says the Holy Spirit established the kingdom in the hearts of the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it's a it's a kingdom by spirit and word. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We have some very, very intelligent people, great craftsmen, great contractors. I can tell you there's no contractor that can take the place of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That Holy Spirit takes the substance and the material of the word and begins to build and craft into your life. I can say today, you have been wrought by almighty God. You have been created and crafted by him. &gt;&gt; That's why he says it takes a drunkard. How how was he a drunkard? And and in a few days, he's totally changed. &gt;&gt; Who did that? The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Establishing the kingdom of God in that man's heart. &gt;&gt; What he has to do? What does he have to do? Really? Nothing. He has to from this door over to that door has to say &gt;&gt; yes. preached &gt;&gt; and the preaching, the Holy Spirit takes the preaching and constructs the kingdom of God into the believer's life. &gt;&gt; I say, praise be to God. &gt;&gt; I want to go on record today. I believe that. &gt;&gt; I believe that not because I'm preaching. I believe it because I have read what Elijah has said &gt;&gt; and I accept it &gt;&gt; and I receive it &gt;&gt; and I believe it'll happen today, tomorrow and throughout the rest of my life. &gt;&gt; This is holding power, friends. &gt;&gt; This is what the prophet said is transforming power. And &gt;&gt; every time you're faced with a situation or a decision, &gt;&gt; you want to find the answer. &gt;&gt; Find out exactly what the prophet of God has said. &gt;&gt; Because I can tell you the God of science is sending those words through your body. &gt;&gt; And you must say yes to those words to have the transforming effect take place in your life. And if they are not the words of God, it will not have that kind of effect. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, the kingdom of God within you. &gt;&gt; He said the kingdom is not of this earth. &gt;&gt; God's kingdom is in your heart. &gt;&gt; It's the spiritual kingdom &gt;&gt; that we're born into. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "The kingdom of God comes not without violence." He said another place, the kingdom comes not by observation. You don't see it. You can't measure it. You maybe can't put your hands on it, but it's a reality. &gt;&gt; It's more real in the seat you're sitting in than the person that's beside you. It's more real in this building. All of this will pass away. But God's kingdom shall never pass away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I came this morning expecting a meeting. [Music] &gt;&gt; I expected a meeting with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible in the one scripture we read, there'll be great signs in the heavens when you should hear wars and commotions. Be not terrified, for these things must first come to pass, but the end is not by and by. Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, kingdom against kingdom, and great earthquakes shall be in diverse places and famines, in fearful sights, and great signs shall there be in heaven. signs in the heavens that are now passed. So we can say as the word said it this was until John. Now something else happens. So there was a era all through the church ages &gt;&gt; like 2,000 years and right in the evening right in the end suddenly here comes a a a messenger 1947 and wasn't 1940 wasn't 1942 but suddenly here comes was a little frail and brother Jean Jacquan and myself, sister Marinette, we were looking at some old pictures I have of brother Brandham and some of the old clippings from newspapers and the crowds in Jonesboro, Arkansas. And I had just heard brother Brandon on tape those meetings in Jonesboro where he said those Arkansas people, they'd stand in the rain and they would wait. and he said, "No wonder God did what he did." He said, "Some of the most remarkable meetings and when I hear I I listen to that and we're going through and one of the pictures that's most touching." I believe it's brother Bernie Garcia from Phoenix. Don't quote me on this, but I think it's his father that is there and it's a in the Spanish church and Spanish people. And brother Brandham is just a frail and thin war. You can see he's wore out and he's standing. He's holding a little girl's hand and he's looking down at his hand. And I understand that she had leukemia. It's such a moving and touching picture. And here's this servant. Who ever who ever would have thought that it would come that way? that God would raise up a man with hardly any education out of poverty and knows nothing about theology and has perhaps a halting and poor English and simple. Who ever would have thought that God would get the attention of the world &gt;&gt; by a man taking people by the hand. He looks on it and I saw him. I was about your age. saw him taken by the hand. Brother CF Huitt is a Pentecostal pastor in Boisee, Idaho. His boy was about 8 years old and as a boy would he was thirsty and he just drank some water out of the ditch and the water was contaminated with with sewage and it attacked his heart. And they took him to Mayo Clinic and they said he won't live. He maybe wouldn't live till he's 10 years old. And when he was about 10 years old, he is so they're trying to get him to go to school. He can only be there a short time, no strength. And they heard that there's a man by the name of William Brham. There just some great meetings taking place in California. And so they go down there. Brother Huitt told me he was a friend of mine. He preached up in our church in Dawson Creek. and he went there and and it was exactly as we saw in Vernon, British Columbia. The people are just mobbed at the door. You can't even get near the door at 2 3 in the afternoon. He thought, "Well, my goodness, this is different." So, he thought, "I can't get in here. I know where he's going to be. I know the pastor in Sacramento where he's going to be, so I'll go there." So, I believe it was Joe Morris if I remember correctly. And so he went to the his his friend, pastor friend in Sacramento said, "My boy is deathly ill." And he said, "I'll have you on the platform. You're going to sit in the platform with me and we'll have him up the first one in the line." You know, that was the pastor's uh uh kind of his thought of it. And brother Huitt was sitting on the platform. And he was kind of skeptical. He didn't know what to think about this. And Sister Hwitt came up. He wasn't the first one. He was the last one in the healing line. And sister Grea Hwitt came up. We knew them for about 40 years. And she's got the she got the son with her. And brother Benham took his hand. And brother Huitt sitting back where brother Tom said, "If he says what we wrote on the card, I will believe that he is that prophet. Not just a prophet, but that prophet." Whatever that was in his mind. and and and Sister Huitt, she's standing there. Brother Brandham takes his hand and he says to the mother, he said, "Uh, now he said, I don't know if God will heal him." But he says, "You you watch my hand. I'm going to ask everyone," he said, "to close their eyes. But I'll ask you to keep your eyes open and watch my hand. He said, if my hand becomes normal, the boy is healed. If it does not become normal, God has chosen not to heal the boy. Isn't that simple? Isn't that simple? And he said, "And the boy has this and this and this." And he named all three things. And brother Brandham turned around and pointed to brother Hwitt and he said, "And you said in your heart, if I said those things, you would believe." Shouldn't take much more, should it? And prayed and he was healed. And the last I heard of Kenneth Hewitt, he was a man in his 40s or something, a electrical contractor in the Boisee Valley someplace. Now, who would have thought? I just said that not to take up time, friends, who would have thought that God would begin to catch the attention of the people and thousands and tens of thousands. And then it wasn't just and this is my my I believe this with all my heart and soul. The spirit of Elijah fell on the whole globe and men raised up all over the place. Whether it be Oral Roberts or Tommy Osbor, Tommy Hicks and Vlner Gardener and Jack Cole and O Jaggers and on and on and men who you never heard their name. They just found that spirit was on them. We had it way up in the north, way in the far north and little ministers and it just began to fall on them everywhere. And some people thought, you know, maybe over in Saskatchewan, North Bford, they thought that they were a special group and that God had ordained them, not realizing that God had actually swept over the whole globe and it was happening in other countries. It was the spirit of the supernatural that had come because it was the spirit of Elijah. But the purpose of it was to catch attention of the people &gt;&gt; because a word was following. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "If a voice doesn't follow it, don't pay any attention to all the signs." &gt;&gt; A voice followed this one. &gt;&gt; And what a voice. &gt;&gt; What a message. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the miracle that goes through you. It's the voice that goes through you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That voice begin to thunder out. Hallelujah. The living voice of God &gt;&gt; and begin to go through the people. &gt;&gt; And some people were m magnetized to it and they caught it. &gt;&gt; They were expecting something from God and they caught it &gt;&gt; while many others didn't catch it. I want to catch &gt;&gt; what God has for us in this in between time. &gt;&gt; We're in a very, very crucial time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there'll be signs from heaven. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; These signs, phenomenal sign. I'm going to just show you a sign in a moment. And the prophet says in the feast of the trumpet, the moon is the wife of the sun. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the sun, when the sun is gone, in the absence of the sun, the moon reflects the light &gt;&gt; to the earth. He He's in the heavens. Now &gt;&gt; you have to stay with me cuz I'm going to maybe be all over the map, but it does have continuity. &gt;&gt; And the moon reflects the light of the earth to the earth, which is a type of the church. And when the pope leaves the a and he he he said when he leaves and he says the ancient enemy of the church and comes over to Jerusalem which is the seat of the church which the new Jerusalem and the old Jerusalem. He said we noticed before it did there was a total blackout of the moon &gt;&gt; before he made this visit. There was a total blackout of the moon. &gt;&gt; And this was the first time in history. Amen. &gt;&gt; That a pope leaves the Vatican and goes to Jerusalem. I wonder if I can just show this. And that is a picture of him there in Jerusalem. And it was January 1964, the first ever papal visit to Israel. During his short trip to Israel, it lasted only 11 hours. Pope Paul V 6th never once called Israel by name and went out of his way to avoid using the word Jews. So he never used the word Jews. In those days the Vatican saw Israel as a non-country and its people as a non-nation. I just want to stop there with those words above you. Now he has a message &gt;&gt; and his message he even he even uh in his speech he spoke positively towards the preceding pope that was silent completely silent while 6 million Jews were murdered &gt;&gt; and he lifts him up and gives him uh an honorable mention I'll say and now he's here in Jerusalem God's city and he will not even mention Israel and will not mention God's people no wonder the prophet says the ancient enemy of the church &gt;&gt; and while he was visiting there's another messenger &gt;&gt; Hallelujah another angel messenger &gt;&gt; sent to the whole earth &gt;&gt; to the elect &gt;&gt; and he has different words &gt;&gt; and his words are that it was the tender hand of Jehovah &gt;&gt; and his words are it was the blowing of a trumpet &gt;&gt; the holocaust was a trumpet he even said that Hitler and Stalin and Mussolini and these people that was a trumpet &gt;&gt; because the trumpet is a calling And it was calling those people back &gt;&gt; back to Israel. &gt;&gt; And those words were penetrating another group of people and they were saying yes. &gt;&gt; While the Christian world thought that this is a great visit and the things and the media and everybody hanging on to every word that the that the pope may speak. But there is another little group of people, a little elect. And many of you were not perhaps even born and not called yet, but you were the called of God. And God knew that you were going to come. And God magnetized you inside. And he gave you a holy crystal that picked up these words. And when it registered on that crystal, you said, "Yes, this is the truth. I don't understand it, but this is God's word to me. &gt;&gt; Is it to you today? &gt;&gt; And here's a man that won't use the word Jew. And here's another messenger &gt;&gt; that doesn't only use the word Jew, but he says that they're coming in. They're being gathered for the atonement. They're being gathered so that Christ Jesus almighty God is going to come down and make himself known to those people. And so the very group of people that this man is disregarding, here's a messenger saying they are the apple of God's eye, &gt;&gt; the creator knows that they're there &gt;&gt; and the creator sent them back there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And now he comes to this group of people to leave you and I some of these things that are taking place and identify them. So here's a messenger on earth and he identifies what we call scientifically an eclipse. He says the moon. He calls what it is the wife of the sun. &gt;&gt; It's the church. &gt;&gt; It's being blackened out. By all of this religion &gt;&gt; and he identifies the system on earth, the first church that broke and became a denomination and it blackened out the gospel of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And to show that the personification of this blacking out, God in the heavens blacken the moon out completely while the pope is making his journey to Jerusalem. There will be great signs in the heavens. &gt;&gt; Many of you here lived through that 1964. You were living. Some of you were in school. Some of you in college. Some of you are already married. Some of you were not born. But those of you that were living, I can assure you no one knew anything about &gt;&gt; what was happening &gt;&gt; while it was happening. And we can say all through the church ages &gt;&gt; until &gt;&gt; Elijah came. &gt;&gt; And then we could come and say, but since the days of Elijah, [Applause] &gt;&gt; there were signs in the heavens &gt;&gt; and signs in the earth &gt;&gt; and turmoil of people unlike any time before. Why? because it's the days of Elijah. &gt;&gt; And since the days of John, this is what's happening. Since the days of John, the the kingdom of God suffered violence. Since the days of Elijah, the kingdom of God suffered violence, but the violent take it by force. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Pope Pon Paul V 6th even used the occasion to praise his mentor Pope Pas I 12th defending the latter silence during the Holocaust. That's all. So we can take that off now. Brother Benham said and in the papers across the nation have to follow very close to continuity please. And in the papers across the nation we have on the board. Now he's got the papers in the nation we have on the board which he drew. It displayed how that the moon turned from light to darkness and the very phenomena of it that the moon drew exactly in the skies. The same thing that the Holy Spirit had me draw two years ago. &gt;&gt; And showing the covering. &gt;&gt; So two years before &gt;&gt; we have God the artist in the heavens and we have Elijah his artist on earth. And God draws something in the heavens and his artist draws something here. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandman who said he couldn't draw anything, &gt;&gt; but he drew exactly those seven circles. &gt;&gt; And they and they showed six in the heavens, but he said he drew the seventh one. &gt;&gt; And he said this, how the Holy Spirit had him draw two years ago the covering. He said, "And when it went six pictures, &gt;&gt; I put the seventh there because the seventh age just a shadow of light &gt;&gt; the going off that." Now I'm talking in between. &gt;&gt; Yes. Now a prophet now Elijah he's drawing the seventh and he's just showing that there's just a a ray of light and he says that's where that's now watch that's where now here's Elijah drawing it and he leaves just a little ray of light and he said that's where Jesus is at the door knocking. &gt;&gt; So now he takes the drawing and brings it straight into the scripture. Yes. &gt;&gt; And I drew it that way because Jesus is at the door knocking. &gt;&gt; And so here we are living, some of us living at that time. Who knew &gt;&gt; that now Jesus was outside? &gt;&gt; Who knew that he's knocking? &gt;&gt; Who knew that he's being put out? But now it had to be declared &gt;&gt; so that you would un understand and I would understand what is happening in our time. &gt;&gt; And he said but it goes but it goes into total darkness. &gt;&gt; Is this too laborious for you? &gt;&gt; And what a reflection. He just stops and says what a reflection. What a message from God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That these things are the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Testified. Watch now. Testified it first in his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then by the spirit at the platform. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then declared in the heavens. &gt;&gt; So he said, "So here it is. &gt;&gt; First it's in the word. &gt;&gt; Then it's declared here at the platform. And it's in the heavens. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There'll be great signs in the heavens. &gt;&gt; But it took a messenger to be able to identify the sign and tie it back to the scripture. &gt;&gt; And now we have a complete perfect confirmation &gt;&gt; in the word, at the platform, and in the heavens. Now, he said also that the messenger came, and we're in a class, and I hope you young people will hang on to this very close because this is more of a study. The messenger always came at the end &gt;&gt; of the age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right? &gt;&gt; He's announcing the next age. &gt;&gt; And that's why they're rejected. So he comes at the end of the age. And I'm talking about the in between time. &gt;&gt; So we're not talking about the time and what happened in that age. &gt;&gt; We're talking now about what happened when the messenger at the end of that age. You said Paul came in at the end &gt;&gt; of the age and brought in the grace, the message of grace from the law. &gt;&gt; And then each messenger as time rolled through for 2,000 years came at the end of the age. &gt;&gt; And at the end of the age of the last Leodysian age, &gt;&gt; no wonder this could not be a reformer. He had to be a prophet that could look into the heavens and say, "There's the sign." He could look into the word and say, "Here it is right here." &gt;&gt; That sign is Jesus knocking at the door. &gt;&gt; Oh, [Music] &gt;&gt; and he comes right at the end of the Leodysian age. &gt;&gt; What is what is supposed to happen between in this in between time? And it's like it was when Jesus came right to the time of the cross. So many things were happening and it left the people in wonderment and in question. We're there. &gt;&gt; All I can say to you friends, we are in &gt;&gt; you are in whether you want to regard it or recognize it or not. You are in the in between time. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; And even knowing that I think will be helpful to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said many of us, he said, remember Paul came at the end of the age &gt;&gt; and all messengers come at the end of the age. It's the end time &gt;&gt; when these things are brought forth. &gt;&gt; I just digress for a moment, but don't don't lose that thought. So, I'm coming immediately back to it. When they made a covenant, the old eastern covenant, they would take an animal and slay the animal like they did like he did with Abraham and put the pieces off and divide the pieces that were slain and and cut. And then the two who were making the covenant would stand between those pieces and they would have a writing on a parchment or perhaps a sheep skin and they would write the words of their covenant. Then they would tear that parchment or skin and each take half and step out then from between this. And what it was is that if either one of them should break their their promise, their covenant, let them be as one of these. &gt;&gt; Let them be as slain as one of these. That's how serious the covenant was. I have to just take and I pray that God give you a deep understanding when the prophet begins to describe Revelation 10:1 and I saw another mighty angel &gt;&gt; coming down from heaven and brother Brandham said it's Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he says something more. For he is the covenant angel. &gt;&gt; He's coming down &gt;&gt; with the peace. &gt;&gt; He's coming down because he is the word. &gt;&gt; But he's coming down to find the other peace. &gt;&gt; That had been separated from him. &gt;&gt; And he comes to stand in the midst of the people, the called and the elect. and opens up the seals. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To find the other peace. &gt;&gt; And you had to have a peace. &gt;&gt; We may give a different terminology. We may call it the crystal or we may call it being magnetized. We may call it being predestinated. We may call it the seed gene of God. All having exactly the same reference. &gt;&gt; You have to be a part of that word. &gt;&gt; And that is why &gt;&gt; it's not just in the emotional realm. It's not in in the mental realm of mental comprehension, but there's something inside that's beyond your understanding &gt;&gt; that is responding to it perhaps even this morning. And that's saying yes. &gt;&gt; I don't even understand everything that brother brother Biscll is preaching. And I've read the seven trumpets and I didn't catch it. But there's something within me that is saying yes to this word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I announce to all of you &gt;&gt; the called of God, the elect of God, whoever you are, if you were with him in the beginning, &gt;&gt; this word and these quotes are penetrating your body &gt;&gt; at this moment. &gt;&gt; To deny that would to deny that there's radio waves. &gt;&gt; For us to disbelieve would be the it would be the ultimate unbelief. Eve didn't have the science we have. &gt;&gt; Moses didn't have the science we have. &gt;&gt; All down through the ages, they didn't have they never had a picture of the pillar of fire hanging over a man. They never had a picture of the pillar of fire following them in the wilderness. Here we know a word that God has come scientifically and confirmed. This is my servant and this is my word and this is my chosen mouthpiece. His mouthpiece. And then he comes up and tells you these waves are going through this building. Colors are going through this building. Voices are going through this building. And I say to you in the name of the Lord, Brother Brandham's voice is going through this building. &gt;&gt; You may say now, I surely know you're off your rocker. That's just exactly what I want to I want to be off this rocker. I want to be into his mind and into his thoughts. And I don't want you to forget this. When you go out of these doors, when you read that message, don't think this is just a written written printed message that came off of a tape. I want you to say to yourself, "These words are circulating the earth and they're going through my body at this moment." And I have felt very very convinced that I should be here this morning to say this specifically to you. &gt;&gt; What you read concerning your life or concerning your situation or where you're at, remember the all knowing and the allseeing and the all compassionate God is sending his words through your very being. Amen. &gt;&gt; And all you need to do, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; is come into agreement with it. &gt;&gt; Say yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody else say yes with me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We will multiply this faith in this belief by multiplied times. &gt;&gt; Yes. We say yes to your prophet's words. We say yes to the message of the hour. We say yes from window to window, from door to door, we say yes. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the seven sealed book &gt;&gt; is revealed at the time of the seven thunders &gt;&gt; of Revelations 10. Yes. &gt;&gt; He said it can only come by a prophet. &gt;&gt; A prophet is the only one that can bring the revelation of the seven thunders to you. &gt;&gt; And he said the thunders in a simple form. It thundered in John's gospel. And the thunder, he said, was the voice of God. I'm telling you that voice from the heavens came and worked through a mouthpiece at a platform [Applause] &gt;&gt; and it's going through this room at this moment. It's going through the walls. It's going through the ceiling and it's going through this body. And I say today, I want my voice. I believe it, Lord. &gt;&gt; I say yes to it. I say yes to your will &gt;&gt; and yes to your achievement. &gt;&gt; Whatever your will is, I say yes to it. &gt;&gt; Then you do not have to try to change yourself. &gt;&gt; You do not have to try to make yourself over. That in itself is the transforming power. [Applause] He'll transform you young people into the kind &gt;&gt; of men and women. &gt;&gt; Not only that he wants that he needs. &gt;&gt; He'll take your lives &gt;&gt; and your homes and you commit it to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He has already spoken it. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just looking for a magnetized place &gt;&gt; to anchor and the Holy Spirit can take that word &gt;&gt; and he entwines himself. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; you'll hear radio perhaps this week. You'll hear voices, but there isn't voices. You can hear all the news talk you want. You can hear all the reports that you want, but there's none of it. Here Elijah has come and said the Holy Ghost will entwine himself around that word and bring it down into your heart. &gt;&gt; God give me this. &gt;&gt; God grant that to our people. &gt;&gt; God grant that to our loved ones. God grant that &gt;&gt; to the bride of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; wherever they're meeting this morning. &gt;&gt; God grant that to them. &gt;&gt; God grant that to us. &gt;&gt; God grant that to the bride &gt;&gt; throughout the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can I go for just a few more minutes? So, if the Lord allowed me to come back to it, I'll certainly have to start because I'm only on page three. The son of man and the son of God and the son of David &gt;&gt; are all the same one, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he was the son of man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; As he walked on earth &gt;&gt; and was a prophet. The God prophet. Not a prophet of God, but the God prophet. &gt;&gt; And then he said to the people, you've heard me say it before, but for those you and in the context of this message, he said, he said to his disciples, it's expedient or it's necessary for me to go. For if I do not go, the Holy Spirit will not come. &gt;&gt; Now what he's talking about, he's talking about changing of offices. &gt;&gt; And some things have to transpire. And the disciples, precious people, we are those disciples in a different era. and they were listening to him &gt;&gt; and hearing God himself speak but were not able to comprehend all the words. And so please be patient. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't. &gt;&gt; Yesterday I was just shaking my head and going through the seven trumpets and things that I needed to and I just wondered how it would unfold into a message this morning. But I had a certain confidence &gt;&gt; that God wanted you to hear these things. &gt;&gt; And and especially in the unveiling of God also in proving his word are two places he's very very clear about this coming in three sons offices. And he comes right to the end of his ministry as the son of man on earth. Only three and a half years of ministry. And at the very end so many things transpired and and the people didn't understand and the disciples didn't understand but as I was saying they were last two weeks ago they were actually part of the event &gt;&gt; and they couldn't understand what was happening and they were actually part of it and the scripture says that the prophets and seers and sages of past centuries they searched diligently ly. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They searched diligently what manner and what manner of time. &gt;&gt; The the things which they spoke which were confirmed in them by the Holy Spirit. Now friends, what you're experiencing is nothing new. &gt;&gt; They were godly people. &gt;&gt; They were predestinated people. And the spirit that was in them was uh confirming and saying out of their mouth certain things that needed to happen. &gt;&gt; And they said, "We don't even quite understand that." And we're searching when is this, Lord? When is this supposed to take place? And then and and and the scripture says that they were speaking of those things of of of ourselves and of them back of the New Testament era. Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; And then Peter said they were speaking of us, speaking of them at that time. They were speaking concerning the sufferings of Christ and the glory which should follow. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now here Peter was there and the other disciples and they are right part of the glory that should follow. But they didn't know they were &gt;&gt; that's you. &gt;&gt; That's me. &gt;&gt; They could see what was past &gt;&gt; and they were yearning to know what was in the future, &gt;&gt; but they weren't even catching where they were in between. &gt;&gt; And it was unfolding. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the resurrection took place and then they're in a short period of 50 years I mean 50 days from the resurrection to Pentecost and I have to come to that in a few minutes these feasts. And then Jesus said it's expedient for you that I go away for if I don't go away then he the comforter cannot come. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and and the other part, there had to be some things unfold in the supernatural realm that the apostle Paul, the first church age messenger, was able to clarify what was happening in heaven, what was happening on earth. Jesus never told them. He never said, "I must die, and I am taking my blood into the holy of holies to stand as a propitiation for you." He wasn't saying that. Apostle Paul said that. He just said, "I must go &gt;&gt; or he won't come." &gt;&gt; And what he was doing was telling them the ending of the son of man ministry as a prophet ministry and the coming of the son of God ministry. And that's why he could say, "I won't leave you comfortless. I will come to you because he was coming in another office in another dispensation. I'm leaving you as a son of man. I'm coming back as the son of God. &gt;&gt; And I'll be with you as the son of God throughout the seven church ages. And at the end of the seven church ages, at the very end, &gt;&gt; he has to come and fulfill the rest of it that he didn't fulfill. And so he picks up a a prophet messenger and sends him at the end of the Leodysian age for a little breach of time as the son of man so that he the the bridegroom now can reveal himself to the waiting bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now we're caught in that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And it's unfolding so quickly. But it's only natural. We say, "Well, well, I I I believe what he said. There was a sign. I believe what the the picture brother had. I believe the pictures of the of of the uh eclipse of the moon. I I believe it was typifying the church. And I believe it was casting darkness on the earth cuz I see it everywhere. But it goes more than that. &gt;&gt; And so now here we are and this messenger is to come. He's to give a message that's happened. Right? &gt;&gt; He's to foretell certain events &gt;&gt; and they've taken place &gt;&gt; and we find ourselves in a unique position where we have certain expectations. But let me declare to you in the name of the Lord, whether you have it precisely down, whether you understand it or do not clearly understand it, you have only one great responsibility. And today to hear this word that I can say to you authoratively that prophet's words and the even the words he spoke that you don't understand, &gt;&gt; they go through you. &gt;&gt; They're penetrating through you according to his words. and long statement. They are going through you. &gt;&gt; Don't weary of that. &gt;&gt; Pictures are going through you. &gt;&gt; Those words you don't understand are going through you. &gt;&gt; You must be in agreement with those words &gt;&gt; and God will take those words because he has empowered those words &gt;&gt; to transform your body &gt;&gt; and to change your body. The word of the change is going through you &gt;&gt; and at that precise moment you are in a yes agreement. &gt;&gt; Yes. I do not know how. I do not know when but I know it surely will take place. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "But in between In between the son of God and the son of David, he comes as son of man. &gt;&gt; And the son of man must be a prophet because he must utter the words of God. &gt;&gt; Listen friends. Oh, I hope you can understand me. And the word is actually Christ himself. And so God chooses a vessel and instead of the womb of a woman, it's the mouth of a man. &gt;&gt; That was a mouthful. &gt;&gt; Instead of the womb of a woman, &gt;&gt; he chooses the mouth of a man, &gt;&gt; a prophet man. And out of this mouth comes the living word of God, Jesus Christ coming to the earth again. &gt;&gt; And that's why he calls it a word coming &gt;&gt; to gather a people. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's not great signs and wonders to gather you. The word Christ is already here. It is him here today in this building gathering you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's telling you children, &gt;&gt; don't fear. &gt;&gt; Transforming power is already here. &gt;&gt; Don't fear. The change of your body is already here going directly through you. &gt;&gt; And at the appointed time, that which is going through you is going to change your atoms &gt;&gt; and you'll be a new creature. from the heavenly realm &gt;&gt; and you'll pass from mortal to immortality. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have a crystal in me that say yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's what we live for. That's what I'm breathing for. That's what I'm preaching for. &gt;&gt; And that's why you're here. [Music] &gt;&gt; All these things of life just become so insignificant, don't they? &gt;&gt; God bless you. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'll have to take up at another time. &gt;&gt; But what I I I will just say this to you. Brother Brham is preaching the feast of the trumpets. I just just for your thoughts so you can be pondering it. The feast there's seven seven feasts and they are found in Leviticus 23. And you'll find the feast of the trumpets between Pentecost and the day of atonement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because at the end of the gentile, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; at the end of the gentile age, which is the feast of long feast of Pentecost, at the end, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; comes a messenger to announce, &gt;&gt; it's over. &gt;&gt; The bride is sealed. It's finished. &gt;&gt; And now the next thing children &gt;&gt; is these things that have happened even while some of us lived. Now he this messenger comes these things that have been happened. You thought it was a great world war and we call it a holocaust. He gave it a new name. the tender hand of Jehovah driving them back to their promised land &gt;&gt; so that they will be gathered back and the trumpets gathered them back for the atonement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here's where I'll be coming to. And this is, you know why I'm going to be speaking it? Cuz I don't understand it. While we're sitting here and we look and watch Israel, we say, "What's happening?" Well, this prime minister comes in and he says this and we get excited. We say, "Yeah, he's a hawk. He's a he's, you know, he's he's going to get the land back." And then the next one comes in and he's just limpo nothing and give it all back and give it to the Arabs and give it to the Palestinians and we get all down. What's happening over there? I can tell you what's happening. God is putting them in a place because the feast of the trumpets has been preached &gt;&gt; and they've been gathered back &gt;&gt; and God is working them over &gt;&gt; until they get to such a place &gt;&gt; that they'll be ready for the day of atonement. &gt;&gt; I say, did God scatter them? &gt;&gt; Did God gather them back? &gt;&gt; No question. &gt;&gt; He gathered them back. And a prophet says it's the trumpets. &gt;&gt; He gather them back. &gt;&gt; And will the day of atonement come for them? &gt;&gt; Will they recognize Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. The words have already been spoken. And those words are actually passing through their body. [Music] &gt;&gt; I feel like doing a dance &gt;&gt; and one day the magnet &gt;&gt; inside and they're going to come to an awareness. It was him. &gt;&gt; It was him. &gt;&gt; Did we kill him? &gt;&gt; Did we kill our Messiah? &gt;&gt; And they're going to go into mourning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's where I want to go next time. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've been a wonderful congregation to preach to and we're going to have a baptism now. We need to have a a song. Brother Derek, can you lead us in a song? Or brother, whoever, whoever, brother John and brother Tom. It's a ray raises. &gt;&gt; Yes. Noah. Well, this I don't know if we've had this before either, and this may be a surprise, but we're going to baptize Noah &gt;&gt; in water. And Noah never had a baptism like this one. &gt;&gt; Raymond and Reesa's son. Hallelujah. He's been asking for this for a long time. &gt;&gt; We're so happy. &gt;&gt; So happy. &gt;&gt; I I I just love the young people so much. Noah, he gets his eyes on me and I I I can't even become distracted because he just focuses right in, you know, like I'm going to hug you whether you want to or not. And I see him coming. I get ready cuz I I have to give Noah a hug. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, we need a we need a a song. Jason, why don't you lead us in the song? I don't care about that beard. That's fine. Jason's been out in the wilderness. We like wilderness men, don't we? Hallelujah. I look exactly the same when I come back out of the bush, brother. Okay. [Laughter] Is it all right? &gt;&gt; I just want to see brother Tom up here. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, we say we come to the water. What is that one? Been baptized. [Music] &gt;&gt; Why don't we stand? Well, I was The scripture was [Music] [Music] My sins were scarred in their w. I was bound by day I free. I was lost in the darkness, but now I found I was seeing [Music] the Lord has my life. I have been changing [Music] for giving a fresh like Heat. Heat. [Applause] Oh my praise God has been changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's been a change in me since Jesus set me free. There's been a change in me since Jesus set me free. I've been to Calary. I'm born again. I cannot turn around for my feet are on solid ground. Someday I'll wear a crown. Oh sh [Music] Tell this place the blessed change that's taken place within my soul. The places I'd once go. The things I used to be have passed away since my first day at Calary. &gt;&gt; There's been a change in sir Jesus set me free. Rejoice &gt;&gt; in that calary. &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm born again. I cannot someday I'll wear and try that verse too. Now my life's a new and now I'm set aart. His holy spirit flows so free within my heart. I have no love for things that weather soon and die. I've set my goal to reach my home beyond the sky. There's been a change in me since Jesus set me free. I to Calary I for I cannot turn around. My feet are on solid ground. Someday I'll wear a crown. Oh my crown. Someday I wear crown. Oh, someday I wear [Music] God bless you. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is a big warrior. Bless you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Noah is a warrior. &gt;&gt; He's joining the army today. &gt;&gt; Brother Noah has been wanting to be baptized for at least over a year. And he came to us and we've waited and waited and he came again. And this is brother Noah's time. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it takes a lot of courage for a young man to give his life to Christ and to overcome uh the things that would be on a young man's heart to step into this this chilly waters. Brother Brandham in God's provided way he said I tell you parents you put the right kind of a home before your children. That's the thing to do because if I'd had a Christian home I'd have been reared in. Perhaps I'd have been further along with our Lord Jesus tonight and maybe more people would have been saved. But my people was not a religious family and God just had by his amazing grace to save me. And then I've led several of them to the Lord. I baptized my mother, my father, my grandfather when he was about 90, my brothers, my little boy here, and then my little girl was seven. My other one's too young to be baptized yet. She's only two. But I trust if she lives, why then she's old enough to be baptized. She's He goes on to speak about that. When Jesus was here, he took little children up into his arms and said, "Suffer the little children to come unto me." There was another quote I wanted to share with you. Brother Vam was talking about uh two elements. One is our mind and one is our soul and we have our mental thinking and we have our soul part which he said that's God in in you. He said when you were born in this world as a child you grew to be a living son. This is you brother Noah. And at the age of choice you hear the gospel in some way and something way down inside of you tells you to receive Christ. And you'll say, "Well, I'm too young now. I'll wait a little longer." And there's there's where you make your first mistake right there. For you grieve this person inside. God's not going to judge you by this man up here, your intellect. He's going to judge you by your soul. Brother Brandham says, "Now hurry straight to the point. If the man by his intellects will finally grieve the Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit keeps saying you should and you say, "Well, I'm too young. Well, I belong to church, but you must be born again." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, if I can get that kind of experience, I won't be able to do this or that or I can't do this or that." Well, you see, the devil will tell you that you're going to lose some good time. You're going to lose some privileges, but he's lying to you, &gt;&gt; especially to your young people. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh my, you don't have to drink. You don't have to smoke. You don't have to run around in these places of amusement. Why the Holy Spirit is a million times better than all the devil could even offer you. &gt;&gt; Why you don't have to get drunk on strong drink to have a big time. Sinners do that, but you don't have to do that. I've been preaching 23 years and I've been drunk the whole 23 years on the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; It's a stimulation itself and it'll never let up. &gt;&gt; Brother Noah, this is never going to let up. &gt;&gt; And I've always got joy, always got peace, always feel good. The Lord is here. And if I'm sick and body, he's got me happy in my soul. &gt;&gt; If things are going good, things are going good in my soul and bad in my body. or vice versa it makes any difference. God is always there and I'm always stimulated with a pleasure that's joy unspeakable and full of glory. &gt;&gt; That's what he does for the believer. &gt;&gt; Brother Noah's going to receive the Holy Ghost today. &gt;&gt; Just a young warrior. &gt;&gt; He's a young man of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; That that heard the footsteps of a cross bumping down the hills of &gt;&gt; Leodysia. And he says, "I want to be identified with him." &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, I'm remembering another dove that flew over another Noah one day. As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it is this afternoon. That we have another Noah that's here wanting to be identified with you, Jesus. And your prophet was speaking when he was here about our precious colored people hearing the bumping of the cross coming up and giving their lives to you. And your prophet said he remembers that and he don't forget that. He don't forget nothing. Father, would you take this brother Noah today that's amidst all the criticism and things of this life and things that a young man would endure and confusion and things that he has to grow up in things that are even &gt;&gt; 10 and even a hundred times more than my generation. &gt;&gt; But Lord, you today are stepping inside of this vessel. &gt;&gt; You are looking for young warriors that are rise above their fleshly &gt;&gt; fears and questions. Noah has a heart for you. He has a love and a tenderness for you. &gt;&gt; Lord, even through camp and even a year ago, he's desired to be free from those things that have bound him. I pray today that that dove of God would flutter within Noah's soul. That as I put him down under the water that your Holy Spirit would birth him and quicken him to a new life. May he continue to be a testimony. May he be a lighthouse. May after today, may he always come back to this moment, Lord. His mother and father are here. His auntie is here. His family is here. And the family of God is here to witness this wonderful moment when he's married to you. I pray that you would receive him, God, and baptize him with your Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I know you've given your heart to the Lord, right? &gt;&gt; All right. Let's just baptize you now. Amen. Amen. Brother Noah, because of your desire to be identified with Jesus Christ, I baptize you in his name, the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. &gt;&gt; If time goes on, I pray that Noah will be such an example to our other young men. God bless you young men, young ladies, families, all that are on the internet. God bless you. They're so thankful for God's people for your prayers. It's been a wonderful day. I I have to forgive me. I had a hard time stopping. And uh we'll get to it another time soon. Next Sunday is the Lord's table. Sunday evening and I'd like you also part of worship. Brother Bram says our giving. So remember our giving our tithes offering that's part of worship. We worship worship him at the at the offering as well. God bless you. Why don't you just stand and brother Tom would you take and close the service in prayer? &gt;&gt; I wanted to sing. I'll say yes Lord. Yes. To your will and to your way. Would be appropriate. But we'll go to prayer. Another thing is I've been called a yes man. I have over the years, brother Biscll. I've been called a yes man. &gt;&gt; I am a yes man. &gt;&gt; I'm a yes man to the son of man himself. &gt;&gt; And I'll stand on that. I I believe it. I've got the crystal. &gt;&gt; And every time I hear the word, it's yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; And I trust that we're a yes bride &gt;&gt; to the word of God. I'll say yes, Lord. Yes to your will and to your way. I'll say yes, Lord. Yes. I will trust you and wait. When the spirit speaks to me with my whole heart I pray and my answer will one more time. Oh, I'll say yes to your will and to your way. I'll say yes Lord yes I will trust you and when your spirit speaks to me with my whole heart I answer will be yes Lord that sums up the day for name for you are the great I am. And our response to that is amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. We've heard your word. And Father, it rings true within our souls. And God, you've opened up our eyes of understanding. And all we can say is to God be the glory. Great things you are doing and have done. We're asking Lord as we ponder the word as Mary said yes let it be unto me according to your word that we can also say yes Lord because a mouth of a prophet has spoken and that has been the spoken word seed and the womb of our soul has been opened and closed around it and now we're seeing a body change within our own lives. We're praying, God, that you'll take this word and plant it deep within the hearts of your children. And God, that they can go rejoicing, saying within their souls, yes, Lord, that's thus sayeth the word. We receive it according to your glory and honor. We ask now, Lord, that your presence go with each and every one of us. We pray, Lord, that the hand of God will keep us. We pray Lord that the dove has descended upon Noah. And God, may it speak shalom to his soul and a peace that passes all understanding. And may the fire of God consume him. And may God, you ever put a hedge of fire around him. Go with all of us. We pray. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they all said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Well, why don't you greet one another? You're dismissed in Jesus name. God be with you all. &gt;&gt; I wonder, brother Tom, uh, I wonder if we could ask brother Jeanjac and Sister Marinette. I wonder if you could go to the back doors and so if you'd like to greet them. They have to leave tomorrow morning early and it would be nice. They so enjoyed meeting so many of you. I want to thank brother Lori and sister brother uh sister Lori and brother Randy for having us over and they were able to meet so many. It meant so much to them. So just greet them and bid them God's good God speed. God bless you. [Music] Let's go. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music]
