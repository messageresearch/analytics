If you could love the presence of the Lord. When you're walking through the valley and the shadows are all around, he says, "Do not fear. God will guide you. He will keep you safe and sound for his promise. &gt;&gt; He has promised. &gt;&gt; He has promised. &gt;&gt; He'll never leave you nor forsake you. And his word is true. God is good.

My God [Music] would [Applause] still [Music] hallelujah. Maybe as we stand together, we are standing on holy ground. Just before we change the order of the service, we have several prayer requests to pray over this morning. The Lord Jesus, we need him on the scene. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are standing [Applause] on holy ground. [Music] all around. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, let us praise &gt;&gt; Jesus now. &gt;&gt; Jesus now we are singing. in his presence on holy ground. &gt;&gt; Maybe you just want to lift your hand to him this morning. We are standing. We confess it Lord on holy ground. [Music] Angels all around. Oh, let us praise Jesus. Now we are &gt;&gt; we are standing in God's presence on holy ground. [Music] Amen. It's wonderful to have the saints from Seattle here with us this morning. Brother Peter Ivano, it'd be nice if you could come and open the service in a word of prayer this morning. remember the request we have before us as the deacons come to receive the morning offering. Brother Richard Drake wants us to remember Sister Barb who's homesick this morning. Sister Shana Vanlair is also home sick with a lung infection. Just asking that the Lord would touch her. Sister Sherry Kukon says to pray for my sister Chris who fell early this morning. She's at the hospital now in a lot of pain and can't sit up and the doctors are trying to determine exactly what is wrong. I think there was a a falling spirit going around this morning. I nearly took a dive down the stairs myself and came to church and my wife texted me as soon as I got here and she said, "Don't make a big prayer request, but if you got to expose the devil if he's there." My daughter Lily fell down the same stairs and hurt herself this morning. So, they're at the hospital. So, maybe they're there to minister to somebody. We don't know the Lord needs. So just ask that his hand of mercy would be upon them. If you have a need upon your heart, we want the devil to be defeated today. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit has a great mind and he knows exactly how to defeat the devil. And we just want to confess, Lord, you know the need. &gt;&gt; You know where the weaknesses are. You know where the frailties are. Help us Lord, brother Peter, to come this morning. Our dear Lord Jesus, Father, we come before you this morning. We're so thankful to you because we know that you are a true and living God. &gt;&gt; We know that you're still the same yesterday, today, and forever, Lord God. Father, you know all of our needs. Father, you know our petitions. You know our desires. You know our prayers, Lord God. You know the cry of our heart, Lord Jesus. Father, we're so thankful to you that you are alive tonight, Lord Jesus. Lord God, you're not in the grave. You're not just a God of history, Lord. But you're the same yesterday, today, and forever, Lord Jesus. And that is our hope. That is our faith. That is what we're standing upon this morning, Lord God. Every morning, every day that we get up, Lord Jesus, we know that you are with us, Lord, because you said and you've promised in your word. Lord Jesus, there is none like you, Father. We just want to adore you and give you praise and thanksgiving, Father, for everything that you do for us, Lord God, for how much you care for us, Lord, because you said, "I will not leave you, Lord." And we hold on to that promise, Lord Jesus. Lord God, and we pray that you would come this morning, Father. Minister to every need, Lord Jesus. Minister to every heart, Lord God. Speak to each and every one of us, Lord God, from the youngest to the oldest, Lord Jesus. May your word go forth tonight, Lord God. You're still the same God. You can speak by the power of your word, Lord Jesus. You can transform lives. You can transform thoughts. You can transform ideas and desires, Lord God. Any plan, Lord God, you could, Lord Jesus, redirected, Lord God, the way you want it to be, Father. Father, we stand before you. We ask you, Lord, Lord Jesus, that you will have preeminence amongst us this morning, Lord. May the word, Lord Jesus, have preeminence in every heart and every soul, Lord Jesus. Father, as I was just reading this morning, Father, your prophet said that you are able to change the nature of the spirit, Father, which is the soul, Lord God. And that's what we're desiring, Lord Jesus, that you'd come, Father, and change the nature of the spirit, Lord God, from a worldly, Lord Jesus, to to a heavenly father. May we, Lord Jesus, be more like you, Lord God. May we not leave this place the same as we came in this morning, but may you minister to every heart and soul, Lord. We pray for these needs this morning, Father, for Sister Barb and Sister Shana, Lord Jesus. And Lord God, for Sister Coupons, Lord Jesus. Father, you know these needs, Father. You know, Lord God, every one of us, Lord God, and we ask that you would minister, Father, and go to those to those places, Lord Jesus, and answer those prayers, Father. Heal the sick, Lord God. Deliver those that are bound, Lord Jesus. We believe that you're still the same God, Lord, and you're able to do those things, Father. We don't we don't just come here just because, Lord, but we believe you're still the same powerful God, and you're able to do those things, Father. We pray that you bless each and every one of us, Lord God. May we give back unto you this morning and our offerings, Lord Jesus, in our lives. We lay everything down at your feet. May you speak to us. May you minister through our pastor, Lord Jesus. And may you be glorified in every life, and every home, Lord Jesus. We love you. We commit everything to your hands. In the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we ask all of these things. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints, as you have your seats this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. God has been so good to us. [Music] Why don't we sing number 1285? Hosana. Let the weak say I am strong. Do have one uh one quick announcement here. I believe pleased to announce the arrival of baby Oello born Friday, April 7th at 4:25 in the morning. Mother and baby are doing fine. Thank you for your continued prayers, the Aello family. Amen. So we want to praise the Lord. Maybe the Geralin family can be coming as well as we sing this little song and then they can have their special. [Music] Let the weak say I am strong.

And those who come before us, light the way, cheering on the faithful, encouraging the weary, their lives a steering testament to God's sustaining grace. surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses. Let us run the race. Not only for your prize, but as those who've gone before us, let us leave to those behind us the heritage of faithfulness passed on through godly life. Oh, may all come behind us, find us faithful. May the fire of our devotion light their way. May the footprints that we leave lead them to believe and the lives we leave inspire them to obey. Oh, may all who come behind us find us faithful. [Music] After all our hopes and dreams have come and gone and our children see through all we've left behind. May the things that they discover and the memories that uncover becomes the light that leads them to the road where each must find. Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful. May the fire of our devotion light their way. May the footprints that we live lead them to believe and the life we leave inspire them to obey. Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful. Oh, may all who come behind us find us faithful. May the fire of our devotion light her way. May the footprints God will leave, leaders to believe, and the lives we leave inspire them to obey. Oh may all come behind us find us faithful [Music] [Applause] many many amen [Music] to be in the house of God this morning we have uh also a few more uh announcements that need to be made. Uh one we like to remember in particular right now, Brother Murphy and Sister Tracy are in Louisiana and I tried to hook on before coming to church and just as brother Murphy was coming to the pulpit, it all froze up. But uh I'm sure he'll be a tremendous blessing to the saints in Louisiana. Louisiana camp, youth camp is coming. Believe Brother Kim is heading down. and Sister Heddy, are you going to? Yes. And uh some of the young people from the school, they'll be going down this week, so we must remember them. And and uh that will be wonderful. Brother Biscll, brother Timman Puit, Brother Donnie Reagan, and uh Brother Ron Spencer will be speaking in Switzerland. That will be a tremendous time. We need to remember them in this Easter week. You never know, saints of God, this could be the final final curtain. &gt;&gt; Let's all go up. Let's all get caught away. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the hour we're living for and living in. And I know there's a couple that's dying for another announcement to be made. They're on the edge of their seats. Families are sitting there. And I think there's a picture that's going to go up here. Johannes, brother Johannes and sister Hana Hannah Schumacher, Jonas's mother and father. Jonas, why don't you stand? We know who you are. He wasn't welcomed when he came because I said he's been here so often. We keep welcoming him. So, Brother Jonas and brother uh Jerry and sister Dana Robinson would like to announce the engagement. Brother Jonas, Sister Hopy, why don't you stand and why don't we congratulate [Music] Amen. Amen. A wonderful young couple had the privilege to spend some time missed last night. I'm sure they had a wonderful occasion. But the wonderful thing is you just have to rest in the fact that you know sisters might wonder well who's my husband or brothers might wonder who's my wife. Don't you worry God has a way of bringing them from Germany to Canada. And we're happy for you. God bless you. And may God just guide you in the days and weeks ahead as we invite brother Biscll to come and minister the word of God. our dear precious pastor that God will anoint him, strengthen him, and use him in a mighty way. And then those that are visiting and have come all the way from Seattle, God bless you. Whether some are here from Victoria, I don't know, but we'll have a wonderful time today, this morning, and around the communion table. I'm amazed that he loves me. Oh, I'm amazed. Let's all sing. [Music] And my sins are washed. They're all washed away. All my sins are washed away. No one knew how alone I was feeling. And the emptiness I try so hard. [Music] Oh, I said my life was mine without you. I was covering up the secret I one day beyond your mercy. And the light show [Music] you and purchase my when you broke when you rose his power to set my spirit [Music] that you love me. I [Music] your preious blood I found for you and my sins are &gt;&gt; there all my sins are wash away. Yes, it's true. Yes, it's true. There have been days when I failed you, Lord. You know the time I've gone astray. But I would that your love and my weakness and your ear is open. [Music] No one else has ever cared for me like you, Lord. Other friends could never be your close to me. [Music] I'm not afraid to. Yes, Lord.

We're praying for brother Murphy. It's nice to see you once again, brother Johannes. and uh to hear the announcement of uh the engagement and and future plans for brother Johannes and sister Hopi. God bless you. We want to uh thank also the uh the song I was expecting a song in Filipino and it was in English. But I'm glad it was in English because the words meant a great deal to me. And uh saying, you know, the fire of God's devotion. That was so fitting to the service this morning. The fire of God's devotion. So, we want something special from God. Then this afternoon, we'll be having the Lord's this evening, the Lord's communion. And we want each one of us to have the testimony that all who come behind us may find us faithful. &gt;&gt; Whoever they may be, if there are more that are coming behind us, may they find us faithful. &gt;&gt; Indeed. We I want to just go to the word in a in a moment. So, can we have a word of prayer, please? Dear heavenly father, we've already prayed and our brother Peter uh prayed. I I I pray you'll bless brother Peter Ivanko and the group from Reon and Seattle that have come to join us for the communion. And we think of those from Victoria that may be here, the island. And uh we know it's been difficult because of the island and the fairies at this time so loaded. But we pray, oh God, you'll bless the gathering of the people. &gt;&gt; We have gathered to honor you. &gt;&gt; This is the Lord's day and it's a great day for us. We thank you for last Sunday and the services, Lord, and our brother Tom and brother John that ministered the word to us and our brother Tim uh Dodd up at uh Grand Prairie, Lord, last week and now back. We thank you for the report of the saints of God &gt;&gt; and those that are gathering and have gathered in Switzerland. And I pray, Father, that your holy sacred presence will be upon the meetings &gt;&gt; and upon the people that gather. You will hold them in your grip, oh God, and pray and prevent the enemy from having anything to do with the meetings. &gt;&gt; We pray, oh God, you'll be glorified. And now this morning, especially, we have some things on our heart. I pray, oh God, that you will take human lips &gt;&gt; and speak the thoughts that come from the throne of God. We're not interested in any other thoughts. We're not interested in human opinion. We're interested in what God has said. &gt;&gt; And what you have conffirmed and vindicated, oh God. Thank you for the cross. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus, for the shedding of the blood. Thank you for that great sacrifice that no one else could ever pay. And we can say we've been redeemed by blood divine. Thank you, Father. In the name of Jesus Christ, we commit ourselves to you now. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll have you while you're standing turn in your Bibles if you would please to Genesis the 22nd chapter and we're going to read verses 15 down through 18 and then we have a second reading in Deuteronomy 28. So in our first reading Genesis 22, I pray that uh we will stand here today present ourselves to Almighty God. Say thy will be done. Don't let it be just another service for you. Say impact my life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm praying. &gt;&gt; All right, we'll start with the 22nd chapter, verse 15. And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham, this is when he took his son Isaac up to be offered. called to Abraham out of heaven and the second time and said, "By myself have I sworn, sayeth the Lord. For because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore, and the seed, and thy seed shall possess the gate of the enemies. You'll notice in the verse before which we just read said, "Thy son, thy only son." He had Ishmael. &gt;&gt; So it just pays to recognize that God has a way of counting that's not our way of counting. &gt;&gt; The elect are the elect. &gt;&gt; Thy seed, thy seed, and thy thy son, thy only son. Uh, nobody knows exactly what may have been in God's mind. But Apostle Paul, he said, notice he said, "Seed, not seeds as in many, but as in one, which is Christ." &gt;&gt; So God's mind is on those things. &gt;&gt; And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice. And then down I want to speak upon uh blessings but in a certain from a certain direction but I thought I would like to uh turn to Deuteronomy 28 and speak about these blessings. And it shall come to pass starting from verse one. Deuteronomy 28 verse one. And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments, which I command you this day, that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth. And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee. Isn't that wonderful? If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field. So whether you're a farmer or a city dweller, blessed shalt thou be shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kind, and the flocks uh of thy sheep. Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store. Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out. The Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face. Do you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; They shall they shall come out against thee one way and flee before thee seven ways &gt;&gt; and eight if necessary. The Lord shall command thee uh blessing upon thee in thy storehouses and in all of all that thou setest thine hand to unto. And he shall bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. The Lord shall establish thee and holy peop a holy people unto himself, and he hath as he hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways. And all the people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord, and they shall be afraid of thee. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord shall make thee plenteous in goods, and in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which the Lord swear unto thy fathers to give thee. The Lord shall open upon thee his good treasure, and heaven uh the heaven to give the rain unto thee unto thy land in thy in thy season in his season, and to bless all the work of thine hand, and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow. &gt;&gt; And the Lord, that's amazing, have a nation with no debt. Do I hear? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's better. And the Lord shall make thee the head and not the tail, and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath. If thou if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the Lord thy God, notice how that keeps coming in, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them. And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day to the right hand or to the left to go after other gods to serve them. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless his word. You may have your seats. I've got a number of quotes, just a few, but I want I'll just have this one up. Please, we'll dim the lights. No, that's not it. Please. I just want the first one. Every Christian. Every Christian. Do we have some here? &gt;&gt; Yes. I'm sure. Every Christian fights a battle. How often? Every day. I want it to sink in. That's why I'm just waiting. Going slow. We're in a warfare right now going on constantly within us between right and wrong. Shall we receive it? What shall we do? Shall we uh shall we bow to the world? Shall we give up this thought that we got? Shall we give up this thought that we got? And uh I had uh in an appendix out of that same message, victory day. And if we see it, said focus on it. &gt;&gt; If we see it, if you see it, doesn't say everybody got to see it, but if you see it, focus on it. And part of the service this morning is that to help you to see it, &gt;&gt; to see it maybe more clearly, &gt;&gt; see what this is all about. &gt;&gt; And I hope that you agree with it. &gt;&gt; If we see it, focus it. Take it from Genesis to Revelation. Don't just let the preacher do it. You do it. &gt;&gt; Take it from Genesis to Revelation. Go home and take the Bible And may perhaps God will speak to you about a certain message or a certain scripture. And she says, "Thus sayaith the Lord each time right down through there. We can't give it up. We can't compromise with the rest of them. We just can't do it. We've got the We've got to stay here. That's all. No matter how great the enemy is and how much machinery he's got against us and how many organizations and how many of this, that, or the other, we just can't compromise. &gt;&gt; That wonderful words. &gt;&gt; I've got a lot more I could say right there, but I just want to go on from there. First, I want to speak on the cause of Christ. Everything has to have a cause. We had a couple remarkable things in this last week. And uh this last week I you know because there's many that are from across the border and many that are here local Canadians. Maybe you don't hear too much about Vimemy Ridge. Vimemy Ridge was a a ridge in France and the French troops were unable to dislodge the German troops in the first world war and they were the it is said that the German troops had spent two years. I have been to vimeie ridge. I and my wife, the people from Netherlands took us there and uh it is it's an amazing fortification. The trenches are not one story. They're they're maybe two or three stories. And they had uh I understand that they had some of the trenches even had not merely kitchens but hospitals and they were prepared to look after the wounded and so on. And they were so well fortified and they had concreted machine gun nests and that's what prevented the British uh not the British but the French from capturing it. And uh that was one of the greatest battles. It was a hundred years 100y year anniversary this last week. And uh there was four divisions of Canadians. Now, we Canada didn't have much of a population back then, but four divisions is I think probably 4,000 or more men and one British division, but there was a total of 170,000 men. And the Canadians had conceived a a plan to attack by uh what they called creeping a creeping attack. And they would go a 100 yards and then stop and let the artillery barrage just over their heads and they just blew the ground there. They've left the ground as it was. It was just uh muddy and terrible. and the uh troops that were going over it. In fact is we feel quite close because my wife's father was fighting right beside Vimemy and her uncle was in Vimemy and uh the Canadian uh troops took the ridge in four days by this creeping attack and they would go a 100 yards and stop and sometimes they were just 30 40 yards 30 40 m from the uh German lines and the German trenches. And uh one one young uh Canadian fellow, he came up with a plan or an idea to tunnel under under the right where the machine guns nests were all concreted in. And he I think they blew up about five at once and uh and made way for them to come and they captured it. And so they're there celebrating the 100th anniversary. Now, that was uh that was not it's not just a matter of interest, but these young men, there was 4,000 that were killed in those four days. Just under 4,000 that were killed. That was an awful cost, &gt;&gt; but it was a cause. It was a cause. There was a cause to fight, but they didn't have a that's not a cause where they chose to fight. That was a cause where they were drafted or they joined, but they didn't know exactly what they're going to be doing. But the military officers tell them what they're going to do or the military department. But here is uh I thought what is life? What's life all about? People are asking that all kinds of people, young teenagers, married couples. They're saying, "What is life? What do I do? Uh do I work for my life and just drop over some at some point and and uh leave the rest behind? What what what's this all about?" And I this is what I'm I'm preaching. I have a very great burden on my heart. The burden of the word of the Lord is what I'm burdened with. And that is that you didn't come here as they call planned parenthood where the parents actually planned you. It was God that planned you. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says clearly, you've been pre-planned. &gt;&gt; Your birth here was pre-planned. And there's one I can tell you there was one being that knew who you were going to be. They knew what color hair you're going to have or color eyes. He knew what country you were going to be born in. He knew absolutely everything. He knew what kind of blend of character and maybe took centuries bringing that down. But then a prophet comes and explains that. says he mixed one with another and another with another and another with another until he got the right ting. &gt;&gt; And that's not the ting you want to hear. That's the thing he wanted to hear. &gt;&gt; And so he put certain qualities and blended certain things together and uh it's really quite an amazing thing. very very amazing that we have been pre-planned and we have a certain purpose. I want to I just want to take my time if you don't mind because because of the brevity of life. Not just the brevity but because of the seriousness of life regardless of what age you are. And I'm looking at some very young faces. But time will slip away from you very quickly. Count on it. And you'll remember these words on down the line. You'll say, "Where did the last 10 years go? Where did the last 10 years that you've lived go?" And that's where the next 10 are going to go. &gt;&gt; And then and and as fast as those went, the next 10's going to go faster. &gt;&gt; It's true, brother Ernie, isn't it? Yes. &gt;&gt; So I think the thing to we need to do as a group of people as a congregation and those of you that are streaming what we need to identify is where are the blessings of God on on what in this life? There's no nation I know that has the blessings. There is no there's no country. There's no there's no church I know that actually can say and boldly declare we have the blessing, &gt;&gt; we have the source. No, it's just the mercy and grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God is dealing with individuals &gt;&gt; and we're a group of individuals. And there'll be some here that will gain more from this service than others. But I pray for everyone and I have been pondering very very deeply throughout this week, not one week, more than one week. And I want you all to listen very very closely. I may say some things that you agree with. I trust I will and some things you may disagree with and that'll be fine. I'll pray for you. So we want to identify what is blessed. And this is what God said in Genesis 22 and1 that in blessing I will bless thee. Speaking to Abraham and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore. and thy seed shall possess the gate of the enemy. And then in Galatians, Paul picks that up and Paul says, "Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made, he sth not, and to seeds plural, &gt;&gt; as to many, but as of one, and thy seed, which is Christ." Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know without me having to go into a whole lot of uh detail that Christ is this word of God living &gt;&gt; and manifested. &gt;&gt; And we know that there's a portion for each time and each season. &gt;&gt; It's not all just that's when when Jesus came. The record of Jesus is here. And I don't really want to do it with this Bible because it's kind of coming apart. But it does have its effect. These two pages here separate the Old from the New Testament. &gt;&gt; And the New Testament is actually just a a portion. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. They record the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The book of Acts records what happened to people like you and me when the spirit of Jesus Christ after his resurrection came into them. &gt;&gt; And then they begin to act and do what he did. And what what what was left in the word of God that was not completed yet. And and the messenger we speak about the messenger prophet messenger in this time. He was chosen of God and the proof of that is his ministry. But he was chosen of God for a a certain allotment of scripture which was not completed and not fulfilled which a people would fulfill. I mean if you say well it's all done if it's what are you doing here? &gt;&gt; What am I doing here if it's all done? No, there's a part for us to fill. Fill. You are written in this scripture. &gt;&gt; And the prophet comes to identify that scripture and say, "Wow, something's left. It's and it's for you." And and and the emphasis is on now the people are coming out and but now this is called a bride. &gt;&gt; And this is a bride for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was the husband. He was the man and and out of the scriptures coming the woman, the wife and this the bride is going to come out. And so there's an aotment for yourself as well. And that is why uh that scripture and the word of God alone bears the blessings of God. &gt;&gt; Because and brother Brandham says it very clearly. He said, "It may sound unreasonable. It may look impossible. It may look as though there's no way it's going to happen." He said, "It is going to happen because God said it was going to happen." &gt;&gt; He's not depending upon circumstances or or you know manipulating things and and arranging so that it can happen. It will happen simply because he said it has going to happen. And it's important for us today to say it's it's going to happen. Whatever the prophet of God has spoken, I I put my confidence there because that's that's the one or that's the ministry that God has confirmed. And when he confirms it from some supernatural realm and if you and if you have any question about that you may vi visit her here or there may be somebody listening on the internet for the first time. You need to take enough it's your life. &gt;&gt; It's your it's your future. You need to take enough time. Maybe you studied for many years in school or advanced education to get where you're at. and and and a lot of people have spent 12, 13, 14, 15 years. You need to spend a few weeks at least to go from Genesis to Revelation and find out and first listen to the messenger. Listen to I do it myself. I've did it several times this week and the last few days. I always go to the end of the service because I when I hear or I'm reading a message book, I go to the end quickly and because some of the things that are spoken, I say that is really stiff. That is really straight. But now I want to come to the end to see what God did. &gt;&gt; And you see God confirming it &gt;&gt; and and God taking a vessel. And a few moments ago, this vessel speaks something that maybe you never saw before or you have a hard time accepting. But then you come into the end and you find God speaking &gt;&gt; and a man saying I'm not in this world. You may be hearing my voice. That's not me speaking. That's him. Where did it come from? If this is a word that God has blessed, then it was in the mind of God eternally. And then I say to this congregation and all other congregations, we better take heed to it. &gt;&gt; We better listen to it. &gt;&gt; We better say that uh whatever I have learned or whatever I have studied that that's meaningless. Whatever I think, &gt;&gt; who cares what you think? &gt;&gt; Who cares what I think? All kinds of smarter people than us have come up before. But what and it's not our opinion. It's not what we not what appeals to us, but it's what God has said. &gt;&gt; Let's find out what he said. You need to take the time to discover what God confirmed &gt;&gt; and then say that's truth. &gt;&gt; And I said all of this to say that's what we need to identify. We need to identify where the blessing is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God said, "I will bless thee and I will bless your seed." And I went to the chapter Deuteronomy 28. So we can just describe the blessing. Let me say this to you as a friend, as a brother in Christ. And if you wish to think of pastor, that's fine, or whatever. I'm so thankful for the ministry that we have here. So thankful for what God has done. Thankful that God has drawn you some way. Somehow he's drawn you and given you an interest and and and sparked a curiosity. Now you're going to satisfy that curiosity because what I have here today, I think will spark some interest for you. &gt;&gt; We got to have a commitment. A few days ago, President Trump, whatever you think about President Trump, I think he probably did a good thing, but he sent uh 59 Tommy Hawk missiles into Syria. While the Canadians are celebrating what they did a 100 years ago, here's a president uh sending missiles into a country and uh on a certain airfield because the president of that company, that country gassed his people and and when the president they said on the news, in fact his newscasters that have been very very in the media which has been very negative and very I think unkind to Mr. Trump without listening, without hearing first or seeing what he's going to do. And we may not agree with what he he's doing or what he promised to do or whatever more. Uh but nevertheless, he really silenced these people, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Uh they don't know what to think now. And he took it to took it to task and said he said these words. He said these people that were gassed and he saysnone of God's children need to suffer like that. &gt;&gt; And to that I could say correct. &gt;&gt; That's right. And that was a brutal thing to do and he felt something needed to be done. And uh so whether that stops it or not, that's beside the point. But the thing is he caught the attention of the world. And he felt that that was a sufficient cause to do something and to send a signal maybe to North Korea or to Iran or some of the other nations that are fully run. And now you have a prophet. I'm going to be reading some things. I hope you don't weary. If you're weary, just stand up and shake yourself cuz I don't I don't speak that often anymore. But I can tell you what, you young people that are here, you could I I'm going I'm going to say some things in just a few moments. I'm going to lay a challenge out to you because I can tell you that you you can be just like you are now. get out in your nice shiny car and go to a restaurant and all the rest of it, but by tomorrow morning, there could be all kinds of devastation taking place. There's been people just like us before living the easy life, enjoying the benefits of life, enjoying families, and in a few moments. in a few moments. &gt;&gt; It may not be Europe. It may be here next time. And and small countries. And brother Brandham says some small country. A small country. Just some wild guy. And this this kind this civilization isn't short on wild guys. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; We live in a very unstable world. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I see you're agreeing. You young people need to. I may not see it and we may not see it. And you say, "Well, we have a prophet says I won't drop a bomb before the bridal be gone." But he also talks about a squeeze. He talks about things. &gt;&gt; He talks about hardships. &gt;&gt; And so that's what I am going to be speaking about. Brother Brandham talked about another group of people and uh this is a little bit difficult for me but we have what is called the Holocaust and everyone knows about the Holocaust. Now those those people they didn't perhaps realize uh that they were written in the word of God. &gt;&gt; This word of God that actually is the only thing that's blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we don't understand blessings. We think well blessings is having enough food and having a better job and all of these things. No. The blessings that you have, if there's blessings on your life, it's because your name was put in the lamb's book of life &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And so I'm going to You can dim the lights please for me one moment. No home in Germany. Everything taken away from them. Everything. I'm talking about combs. &gt;&gt; Combs. So they couldn't comb their hair. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the hair from the women. You got Don't ever complain about your long hair. I've seen mountains of it &gt;&gt; where they just cut off their hair. and dehumanize them. I'm talking about I'm talking about doctors. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about school teachers. I'm talking about young people. I'm talking about children. And it says he said also in Italy and Russia and no place to go and they uh they were sent back to their homeland just to fulfill the word of God. I wonder if the people could say together, just to fulfill the word of God. Shall we say it, please? Just to fulfill the word of God. Once more. Just to fulfill the word of God. No place. No place to call home. Just to fulfill the word of God. Driven from this country, unwelcome. and many times still unwelcome just to fulfill the word of God. The blessed word of God. The word of God that is that I by myself have sworn. God said and I can tell you this message, these people that got problem with this message, they got a problem with God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's that the message doesn't unfold the way many think. &gt;&gt; And I want to dislodge any thoughts in your mind that has to happen the way I think it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen that way. &gt;&gt; And we are anticipating a rapture. And I can tell you it just uh you know it's not going to be just a easy woozy thing that we just uh keep floating on. I'll just go to church and get ready and hear some exciting things and get ready for the rapture. What is the rapture? &gt;&gt; H how does it happen? Uh h how are these things to take place? What are you expecting? &gt;&gt; See those are why why do I ask that? Because I think that I I think about that. I ask about that and I know that the prophet of God, he speaks of it sometimes that you that you come to a place of faith and he talked about faith and tied faith to the rapture. So sometimes we don't have enough faith for healing. And what about faith for the rapture? Oh well, there's maybe perhaps something. And then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. And I don't want to uh make it difficult for you sitting here listening those on the internet and whatever more. What do you know about the word of God? What do we know about the message? uh when when have we absorbed it and pondered it and and uh you know I I don't want to present myself as being anything but this last week I just pondered as I read uh a quote and another one and and and as I pondered who it was and who's speaking and some quotes I'll come what world he was in he said I'm in another world I thought what world is that? &gt;&gt; And then he said when you get there and in that world and he said when you come back out of the vision you have the word of God. I thought that's the go that's the word that's blessed &gt;&gt; our this blessing that come from God come from another world. It's not a blessing of this world. It's from another world. It's not from a world of time. It's from a world of eternity. It's something foreign to us. We have beginnings and endings. The start of the day, the end of the day, beginning of a job, the end of a job, starting a school, the ending of school. Eternity doesn't know anything about that. You've got to get out of that out of that place. Oh, it all begins. It all ends. Now we're getting married. Now we now we have a life and then we have a death. It's not that. This is an eternal God. and he picks up a one one person and he start to generate his word through it and and and he hardly knows where he's at and and he doesn't know it. He's looking around to see if he's in in this world. He's not that's not for him. That's for you. &gt;&gt; That's for us. &gt;&gt; Has to alert alert us where we are. &gt;&gt; He says a dark world. I'm not preaching a negative message. If I can get you on this side into how God has been dealing and I I I will read a read a quote and read it and my wife came into the room and scared me actually into the study cuz I was so deep in and being affected by what was taking place. I thought, well, if I read this, it's so simple. So simple. But yet I can tell you that the spirit of God comes moving out of that realm. I it didn't make any difference that I was sitting in my study or or the messages 30, 40, 50, 60 years ago. God knows nothing about that 60 years. He's the eternal one. And he sees a son or sees a man or whoever he is. I don't feel anything special, but I'm sitting there and I'm absorbing and seeking to hear and seeking to make contact with that God. And before a few moments passes, I find myself weeping. Oh, I'm so moved. I'm so moved at this presence. Oh, and then I understand. I know why. He said, "Isn't he lovely?" And I begin to say that so many times. You are lovely, Lord. Oh, you're so lovely. You're so wonderful. This whole atmosphere is so glorious. It puts you out of this world and out of this life and into another place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh God, help me. &gt;&gt; Help me to convey this. &gt;&gt; Help me to convey this. Not the thought, not the quote, &gt;&gt; but this atmosphere. Help me to convey this &gt;&gt; how you're are feeling and what you have said and what you think about things. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So he said just to fulfill the word of God. Oh the loving hand of God. how sometimes it looks cruel the way that people suffer, but it still it's the tender hand of Jehovah leading his little children. We thank you, Lord. And I thought very deeply about this. And some of you, you that are here that are school teachers, you are that are parents, you may not agree with this, but my wife has difficulty, and I don't blame her at seeing the pictures of the Holocaust. And I would challenge anyone who thinks that they're able to look at the pictures of stacks of bodies of the Holocaust. You think, "Well, that's just too terrible." It is. It is very terrible. But I I challenge you to look at it and say, "Tender hand of Jehovah." That doesn't agree with your mind. That doesn't agree with the 20th 1st century thinking. &gt;&gt; That doesn't agree with Canadian or European or American life, but that agrees with what God said to fulfill the word of God. So, what kind of a God are you teaching? I don't know, but it's a God of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with and he he uses whom he uses. &gt;&gt; He uses wicked men. &gt;&gt; He uses vile, dark, wicked men. &gt;&gt; But they fulfill his purpose. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about God. If we could get a understanding, if we could get a real revelation of who this God is. &gt;&gt; And what he has blessed, he's blessed. &gt;&gt; It has nothing to do. He's not going to ask anybody, "Can I bless it or can I bless them?" He doesn't care what people think about William Brandham or Martin Luther or anybody. He doesn't care what they think about them. He raises them up. They do what they're supposed to do. They go off the scene. that and that that's that's his doing. And then we could just say God is God. &gt;&gt; That's my God. &gt;&gt; That's the one who conceived redemption. &gt;&gt; He saved me. &gt;&gt; And he's the only one that has the capacity to forget, to wash from his memory. We don't have that capacity, it seems. But and we let Satan get in there and use our memories like a playground. &gt;&gt; And all of you you people that have failures, we all have failures. &gt;&gt; We all have miserable failures. &gt;&gt; And and and we we can't re we can't wash from our memory, but he can. &gt;&gt; He can literally wash from his memory. Why? Because he's God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to just read this. Did you know that the Greek word holocaust means burnt whole? For the early Jews who followed the laws given in the first books of the Bible, a holocaust was a sacrifice to God. The burning on an altar of a lamb, goat, or young bull. The word is used about 200 times in the traditional Greek version of the Old Testament, though it rarely appears in English translations. In the 1700s, Holocaust began to be, and I'm not speaking about the Holocaust, but it's a reality. &gt;&gt; Yeah. 1700s began to be used to refer to the mass destruction of life. But no mass murder in western history ever approached this scale achieved by the Nazis. And incidentally that was a political political group. As many as 6 million Jews may have died at their hands. &gt;&gt; Right now I'm making I'm moving slowly. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; You honor a Jew and God will honor you. Now, there's a bunch of Jews that's renegade &gt;&gt; just like there's Gentiles the same way, &gt;&gt; but the real Jew, God's put his name on the book before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And here, here he was murdered down in this time. And remember, think of it now, how perfect this is. Right after them, millions of slaughtered Jews, innocent people by the nations of the world. Here the scripture says right in this time that there each one under the altar &gt;&gt; realized what has happened and they are given white robes. Here's my second challenge to you. You look at those very vivid photographs and say given white robes. &gt;&gt; They didn't know it. There's not there's not a preacher living or that is in history that have used these words. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to say something. Your prophet used them. &gt;&gt; You can't look at those pictures and say tender hand of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; You've got to eliminate what's in your mind. You've got to dismiss what's in your mind. And I'm going to read a scripture. I'm going to read a a paragraph where he said in prayer, "Help me to dismiss my thoughts and dismiss my life." Friends, these are incredible times. But when you look at those pictures and I did not look at those pictures I've been to I've been to I've been to Ashwitz. Lots of been people been to Awitz. That doesn't mean anything. A lot of people have seen the same same things we've seen. They don't have a prophet who says the same thing. &gt;&gt; That's what stirs a person's heart. &gt;&gt; At least it should. &gt;&gt; Amen. to look at those rooms to look at those places and I stood in front of those ovens. I'm not bringing it back in my memory now, but I did stand in front of those ovens and realize that there was people that had to wheel those bodies in and wheel them out. And here somehow God was receiving a life &gt;&gt; as a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; And they didn't know that in moments they're going to have a white robe. [Applause] &gt;&gt; They didn't know there was a tender hand of Jehovah &gt;&gt; driving their offspring and future people. and become a nation because be why to fulfill the word of God. He has to go there and reveal himself to them. &gt;&gt; How precious is the plan of God. Listen to me church. If you never hear me again, listen to me this last time. This word that carries God's blessing is the only purpose and cause you have in life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There's not another thing &gt;&gt; to be a carpenter &gt;&gt; or to be a steward on airline, brother Milant. What is all of that? Where's that going to go? There's multitudes of them. &gt;&gt; To be a teacher or to be a principal or to be a educated person, that's wonderful just in this life. &gt;&gt; But the only purpose, the only purpose is for the cause of Christ. [Applause] And now that I've come to that point, we have a certain vision. &gt;&gt; That vision is not a human vision. That h that vision is something that has come painfully &gt;&gt; through the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; The message is not an easy message. The message is not a uh something that's compatible with this generation. &gt;&gt; I knew the way that the prophet spoke about homosexuality and the perversion of the world that could never be popular in America or Canada. &gt;&gt; Could never be popular and it cannot be popular in the world. Nevertheless, he was speaking God's thought &gt;&gt; and it'll never be compatible with human thought &gt;&gt; or modern thought. &gt;&gt; So, we have a very difficult situation. You're living in a modern world. &gt;&gt; You're educated into modern thought &gt;&gt; and it is imposed upon you. That's right. &gt;&gt; You're strange if you don't believe it. &gt;&gt; And then you go to church and hear something else. &gt;&gt; And now you're put into a battle every day. &gt;&gt; What is it that we're going to believe? &gt;&gt; Are we going to believe what we're taught? &gt;&gt; Are we going to believe what is required in this world? We had a number of and perhaps still do a number of police officers. I asked John Bin in China when we were under arrest. Have since have since asked his wife, they have one son. Are you Do you think about another child? Oh, no, no, no, no. That's that's out of the question because The regulations at that time was one child. The regulations in this country have to do with perverted life and making it acceptable because we are what is called an inclusive an inclusive society. An acceptable society. And that is perfectly fine to a degree. &gt;&gt; But there are some things that you cannot fellowship with. &gt;&gt; There are some things that you cannot be in harmony with. &gt;&gt; And I knew that our some of our brothers that are in the police force are going to run into a collision. This Bible is on a collision course with modern thought. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And you cannot serve both of them. &gt;&gt; That just happens to be a reality. That just happens to be reality. And good times may not also always be the kind of times that we are expecting. this message of commitment to a cause, the cause of Christ revealed in this day. Brother Brandham was uh you know he had a lot a court case against him and it was on taxes and I'll tell you exactly why. So I hope everybody's listening and on the internet. He would get a they'd take offerings of course in these large meetings sometimes take an offering. He he wouldn't, but there would be offerings taken. And so people would just write a check, you know, Billy Brandham or to Brother Bill or however it was, brother Brandham, and they would just go in to the association to pay for the cost of the uh and and when I was with him in the early 60s, he was he was still he was just getting a salary at that time, and it was $100 a week, $400. about $400 a month at that time and that is why we here just get a salary as a ministers we get a salary we do not this business whatever anyone else wants to think that's up to them but I want to keep it squeaky clean and uh so some years later a tax inspector came against him after for back taxes and actually that's why I was in Toronto. I was waiting to go and to he had asked me specifically to write a proposal to the trustees and to uh he said he'd like to bring his books his books not the spoken word books but his books which are like 20th century prophet etc under or prophet visits South Africa and bring them into one office and look after the tapes. And he said, "I the tapes are sometimes not good quality." And he says, "I have widows is what he said. I have widows and they play the tape and half of it is is blank." And he said then he said, "Then they always write me." And you'll find that also in on the on the tape. He speaks about it. So the last letter which I have at home was from Billy Paul and I was asking some specific questions as to how many were on the list etc because I wanted to make sure that I could make a living for my family and they said there was 800 and some that were on the list in the last meeting which was uh July I think in 1965 and he said and daddy doesn't want to make a major decision until the tax case is settled and it wasn't settled until 1965. And uh so he's talking about that and he says he says and then they they'll send people away in federal prison for 20 years. And so he says I was at the an attorney. I was t he was talking to an one of the attorneys and and I had to go up to Chicago I think for the for the court case. So if you sit as quietly as possible. And uh so he said, "Well, I have brothers in the federal prison." He said, and the attorney says, "You have?" Well, he said, "I did have." He said, "Well, what's their name?" Well, he said, 'Well, one was John John and Alcatraz of Patmas, right? &gt;&gt; He said he was a federal in the federal prison. And he said, and and then another brother is is Paul, and he was in a Roman federal prison. And then Daniel was in one, and uh and he was in a federal prison. And then ju Joseph was in a federal prison accused of the potterer's by potterer's wife and he said he spent there and his hairs all grew out and and uh he said he had they even had to shave him before he could come before Pharaoh. He said uh uh oh I've had a lot of brothers in the federal prison. I thought they're my brothers, too. Is this all right? &gt;&gt; Those people were committed. &gt;&gt; They were young men, but they were committed. &gt;&gt; This church exists because of this message. &gt;&gt; Listen to me now. This church that you're sitting in exists because of a commitment to this message. &gt;&gt; Used to be just a lot of young people. Then they married, they had children and their children needed a school. That school over there, BCA, is a part of this church and it needs to be committed to this message. &gt;&gt; I'm not asking you for your agreement. I'm telling you that. &gt;&gt; Mount Baker Bible Way Camp. It's another entity. Bible believers of Washington is another entity. I am here to announce that these entities. Yeah, they're pieces of paper that have been established etc. But they exist because of this message. And furthermore, I believe that this message actually is carrying or is packing because I can take years and years and years and years of messages and I find the same God &gt;&gt; that's visiting on the first message is still there on the last message. [Applause] And I find if he didn't change his mind, I don't plan to change my mind. &gt;&gt; And if I change my mind, I'd like you to show me someone that has the same vindication, &gt;&gt; the same supernatural &gt;&gt; to give me authorization to change from this to that. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, I'm not interested in men's minds. or their opinions or their reasoning or anyone else. I'm not interested in their smarts. I'm not interested in their ignorance. I'm not interested in anything. But I need to satisfy myself because I have a soul. &gt;&gt; I'm responsible for my wife. She has a soul. &gt;&gt; I'm responsible for my children. They have a soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. You better have a very good argument. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm serious about these things. &gt;&gt; You have a soul. &gt;&gt; You young people, you children, you have a soul. &gt;&gt; And here is a soul. those people of having to do with I see I see sitting here in the congregation I personally believe that we have a great responsibility we say well it's a BCA and it's a school or MM MBBC DC or Mount Baker Bible Way Camp or Bible Believers of Washington. Bible Believers of Washington came about because there were many Americans that were moving into the Washington area and I simply said into the office one day. We we give people tithe receipts and whatever it has to be seamless and whatever we do in Canada, we got to be able to do in the States. That's why it exists. but it's because something was happening and when people are saying I'm attracted to that and I would respond, "God bless you, &gt;&gt; or you come from China or you come from Africa or wherever or we we we don't just have a a little phrase and say, well, it's multic multicultural and so on so forth." Those are all modern terms, but I as far as I'm concerned, it's men and women &gt;&gt; gripped by the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I'm not an old man. Just uh I these are things that I've pondered for a long time. &gt;&gt; And they are they exist. This church exists because a message of the hour has gripped people's hearts and they have become committed to the cause. &gt;&gt; And now I'm going to go a little bit further. Is that all right, brother Tom? I'm going to go a little bit further. I don't feel right in my heart about people just becoming attached &gt;&gt; and living off the avails of the sacrifice of others. &gt;&gt; Listen folks, people sacrificed to build this building. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; People sacrificed. People sacrificed to put Bible the BCA together. People sacrificed incredibly and still do. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I thought of you, brother Norm Woods. So quietly, brother, you brother Kim Dingwall, so quietly the people at large don't know of the positions and the salary you turn down. And you, brother Norm Woods, vice president in Lafarge concrete. I may happen to know that. Many don't know that. And you retire and give yourself to the young people. Do you kids appreciate that? Is the vice president of a concrete company. Lefar cement and comes and teaches uh a class at school. And I don't know many of you kids maybe sat there and had brother Norm Woods or Brother Kim Dingwall and other people come in there and it doesn't matter what they do. It doesn't matter what they do. It's, you know, I I see your brother Sam Waldner. Brother Sam was there on his knees putting putting the tile on the floor and and so on and and I just thought, well, that doesn't take a whole lot of genius. And I'll just watch him and and and he was so particular, you know, he if I didn't lay it just right, he'd rip it up and put it down again. And his great big strong hands and God bless you. But that's how it happened. And then others, you know, other people just tood in say, well, you know, it's nice school and oh, wonderful. And, you know, they don't give a thought about anything. It wasn't for that purpose. and you who have come after. That's why I appreciated I wrote those words down that all who come behind us find us faithful. &gt;&gt; And you kids that are you young people, you're going to have somebody coming behind. And I want to counsel you today. Do what I've tried to do and be committed to it. It's not in and out and up and down. And I've tried to live steady. &gt;&gt; I've tried to live stable. I've tried to live honorably and with integrity. I've really tried to do that. It's not always easy. And you're you can be misunderstood. I'm not Please don't forgive. Don't for don't don't don't misunderstand me uh you know unnecessarily. And I I I still want to preach just a wee bit. Can I do that? Now, I actually did all of that to set the kind of the foundation so you can see where I'm going. I believe that people that want to come and have benefits of the church, benefits of the school, benefits of the camp, benefits of the missions. They also need to know that we are in expectation of a commitment. &gt;&gt; You folks need to support that. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what I believe. I believe it's wrong for Holy Ghost teachers to sit here to be in this church. Or others say, well, no, I don't agree with the you don't agree with the headship of the church or you don't agree with the headship of the camp or the headship of the school. Listen friends, that whole thing exists because of what burden. And I want the people to know it is a burden. And when it gets right down where the rubber hits the road and then the issues come to rest here about the uncleanness or about uh if there's anything to do with the law, anything to do with the regulations, there's a few people that have to worry about it &gt;&gt; and some of them are on this platform and we may be the ones that are laying awake at night wondering and praying. &gt;&gt; My wife came and stood behind me in the study early in the morning the other day and said, "How did you sleep?" Well, why? Well, she said, "You were saying something. You were talking in your sleep. Really? She said, "Well, yeah." You said, "Oh, Lord." I said, "Well, yeah, that's you know," she said, "It sound like you're maybe praying or something." Oh Lord. You know, there's only one person that you can go to at certain times. When you got things that need to be resolved, &gt;&gt; and it's him, &gt;&gt; the lovely one, &gt;&gt; the one who could say, &gt;&gt; "Yes, &gt;&gt; I give them white robes." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I call it the tender hand of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; And I thought, I got to speak on it. &gt;&gt; And I know that that's not a this isn't a regular service. This isn't something that you're going to, you know, I I'm letting it go out on the internet, but nevertheless, I'm glad for you that are here. I'm glad that you're sitting here listening and giving me a time. But I tell you, I'm speaking from if you read ma if you read Malachi 1 and 1, it starts out the burden of the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Another prophet starts out the burden of the word of the Lord. Let me tell you friends and I had a a a minister here just a few days ago and he's from the eastern part of the world and he said I I want to ask you about the church. I want to ask you about how you conduct things and and the affairs of the church and how how do you handle the financial things and I was so glad I could just be entirely open with him because they've seen things and they've seen things that they admire. They've seen things that have have lived through the storms of time. Listen folks, we've gone through storms. &gt;&gt; We've gone through false accusations. We've gone through lies, absolute lies, but we've come through the other side. And I have one thing to say about it. It's because of the blessing of God upon the word. Not because of our character. Not because of any of those things, but because the blessing of God is upon the word. And he and if he sees you as a servant, &gt;&gt; a servant of the word, this young lady, this man, they're going to live this word. You will be blessed of God. [Music] &gt;&gt; The blessing is on the word. &gt;&gt; And it's irreversibly upon the word. &gt;&gt; That's where the blessing of God is in this world. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you live just to raise a family and live and die, it's nothing more than the rest of humanity. But you say, "I have a cause." &gt;&gt; And it's the cause of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's the cause. &gt;&gt; I have a real cause. &gt;&gt; And if you only affect one, &gt;&gt; it's worthwhile. If you only influence one into the kingdom of God, &gt;&gt; it's worthwhile. &gt;&gt; You know, when things and I'm going to close in a few moments, but I like to know where something originates. And if this if this has a blessing, if there's a blessing on this message, I want to have you have a look at this. This is a prayer and the prayer involves as a commitment. Lord God, I promise you a new I'm taking this in steps. A I promise it might help you to say those words. I promise. Do you dare? &gt;&gt; I promise. I promise a new. Let me live. And this request comes, let me live as long as you have desire of me living. Not how long I desire to live, but as long as you desire me to live. And then the prayer, let me be true to the principles of this word &gt;&gt; and then surrender. May I live till I can dismiss my own thoughts and dismiss my own life. This is deep. Dismiss my own life and let the life of Jesus Christ reflect through it in his promised word of this age. And then prayer for others. And may this great promise come upon everyone that's present now. For we ask it in Jesus name. And that Jesus happens to be living. That Jesus happens to be in this place. That Jesus happens to be standing here listening to me. &gt;&gt; And this prayer of this prophet and this prayer which I read, I I I am praying for you. May I so live till I can dismiss my own thoughts, dismiss my own life, and let the life of Jesus Christ reflect through it in his promised word. And may this great promise, hello all the congregation, this is the word that is carrying the blessings of the almighty God. There is no other word. There's no other word that I know of. There's books and books on theology. I cannot guarantee you that the blessings of the Almighty is upon that. But I know that this happens to be I'm a simple person. This happens to be a word. Listen, congregation, you've come here as committed people cuz you come here for Sunday. You come here to hear the word. You're committed to it. I'm I'm taking your commitment seriously &gt;&gt; and people contribute marvelously. They labor incredibly to make this all possible. I am indebted, eternally indebted to the people of this congregation. I see your brother Esther Hazen. He sends a report every Saturday night. I receive it on and our brother Kobus I tell you what you may sit there but I appreciate it. You may think that you're not seen or recognized but I I do. &gt;&gt; I see you there and I can tell you it was 560ome sentences. He numbers the sentences that have been proof read &gt;&gt; from one week to the next week and sends it to brother brother Tim Dodd and myself. That's incredible that somebody sits here in the church &gt;&gt; and counts the sentences &gt;&gt; that have been proof read of this message. &gt;&gt; I can tell you that God's blessings are upon a life that does that. That's a commitment of a kind. &gt;&gt; Unrecognized, no great big band playing, no big office in the church, but something's in the heart says this needs to be done and just goes ahead and does it. I say God bless you. But more than that, the God of the word, &gt;&gt; I'm saying it flat out. Whoever that God is, whoever that God is, I even said in prayer this morning, God, let me know you better. Let me understand you because it's so so mysterious. some of the things that he does. &gt;&gt; I find it incredibly mysterious when he can take stacks of human bodies and say it's a tender hand and have a man I can tell you he's dismissed all reasonable thought. &gt;&gt; He's dismissed his own blind thought. He's dismissed his own affection. He's dismissed it completely. Say it's the tender hand of Jehovah driving him back because that's what the word of God declares. &gt;&gt; I had a leader. Can I go on a moment or two? &gt;&gt; I had a leader of the Israeli people that came here and spoke. Garrison Solomon. How many were in the meetings? Raise your hands. Many of you. Gen Solomon. I drove him and his wife to the motel down here, the Ramada. We were parked outside. his wife had gotten out and she was at the door and he was sitting there with me and he said just uh privately he said my wife she cannot get over that holocaust. She just cannot accept it. She cannot get over it. And I said, "Well, you know what our prophet said?" I said, "Our prophet said it was the tender hand of Jehovah, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; And he just looked at my glove box. He couldn't understand that for the moment. I said, "Because he said, you people have be back in it took that to drive you back into your homeland. and God cannot bless you until you're in your homeland. &gt;&gt; And he said, "That is right." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I walked I got out of the car and I walked to the I walked to the front door. Listen friends, I'm not telling you stories. I'm telling you about events about you, about the people of this congregation. And I walked to the door where Naomi's hand was on the handle of the door. She was going to pull a ramada handle open. Yeah. She said, "I've never met people like this." And pulled the door open. Friends, that's your testimony. &gt;&gt; Friends, that's the message testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't know what what what you're echoing out. &gt;&gt; You don't know what you're screaming out. You don't know what kind of because because our service is being streamed this morning. Some things I can't even say because they were just spoken the other day to my wife. She invited a businessman from downtown to be streaming the service this morning. And he may be You don't know how far the testimony is going. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I personally feel I personally feel that we have a responsibility to be committed to this message that we need to renew it perhaps. I feel I'm just going to going to bring the service to a close. I'll maybe make a personal confession and that is that I I'm very very desirous to be connected to that world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. and the message. Let me just go over these quickly. I don't know if you've ever heard this. Brother Brandham says, he says, "Now quickly to a vision. It happened two years ago. I was in my room right after a big meeting and I seen a rocky hilly country just as natural. Not a dream, he said. Can you hear me? All right. Not a dream. In a dream, a vision is something you're looking at like I'm looking right now to you or you looking at me. Sometimes I'd be standing right like this and I'd sit in my room, been sitting in my room talking to my family and move completely away, be gone for an hour uh and a half or two hours. Listen friends, I'm not telling you a story. &gt;&gt; This is something you say, "I'm connected with this. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to I'm going to make a statement in just a moment which I made before. This is where this message originated. &gt;&gt; It didn't come out of Louisville. &gt;&gt; Didn't come out of Jeffersonville. &gt;&gt; Came out of eternity. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And I'd sit there perfectly still without a speck of breath." Do I have to say that again? Without a speck of breath. And you don't understand that. Neither do I. But that's fine. He said, "And that's what medical science can't understand. where it done not even a speck of breath. You could put a fine a thing of any as you want around my nose and not a bit of breath they tell me. But my respirations, heartbeats just the same, but they don't understand it. Now listen friends and he says fading out into another country, another world and when you return you have just exactly what God had said and it's never failed and it can't. It's God. &gt;&gt; I just stopped there. &gt;&gt; That deserves a real commitment. If I never see you again, I will say this. We have a cause. &gt;&gt; We now have a purpose to live. &gt;&gt; You will not get this in the finest of schools. You'll not get this in a Bible school. &gt;&gt; And the same prophet says the church is a mess. &gt;&gt; Right? And I am so thankful to God that at least we have a place where we can come and sit. And this is a spiritual reprieve. &gt;&gt; You can sit here. You can rest yourself and you can know for certain you're not going to hear something wonky. &gt;&gt; There's no kingdom building. That's right. &gt;&gt; I've told the people in Switzerland, I'll say to these people here, I am personally resentful against anybody trying to build a kingdom. What human thinks he's worthy of a kingdom? &gt;&gt; What What person has a a a a ministry that's worth following and he himself's going to fall into the grave? &gt;&gt; I say, I want them to be connected to the eternal one. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But that we might know him better. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That we might not that we might be connected with him. Brother Roy. &gt;&gt; So I hear little simple things. I hear a prophet saying to and I've said it here several time might not mean anything to you but it means volumes to me. &gt;&gt; Right. Isn't he lovely? &gt;&gt; Isn't he lovely? &gt;&gt; I think though, where is he at? What's he seeing? &gt;&gt; Who's he seeing? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let me let me and I and I yearn for that contact. &gt;&gt; And God helps me to enter into that place. And that's what I pray. I ask for this congregation, Lord. Let them feel that same feeling. Let them let them experience, not the discernment. Let him let them experience this lovely one. You're on the balcony. Oh, that you might know him. Experience this lovely one. I know that you've got work to do and bills to pay and that's this world. &gt;&gt; Listen close now. You got things to study. You got burdens of life. You got all kinds of things. That's this world and it's passing and you're going to leave it. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; But the thing that got a hold of you and have pulled you in here &gt;&gt; and made a a group of people, we call it Cloverdale Bible Way. That's just a name. But it's you &gt;&gt; the people &gt;&gt; that God, the eternal God said, "That's my child &gt;&gt; and they're worthy of my tenderness. And in his tenderness, he may do things that you don't understand. Sometimes they say, "Well, that I I laid a couple challenges out." I said, "Well, look at this. If you look at these photos and the problem is we look at it and our eyes register in the brains and and then our emotions get all caught up into it and we see the young people, we see the babies." You know what? God, for some reason, he allows, and I I just began to go across the congregation, there's quite a number here that are living without their loved ones. And some of them went very, very young. My mother went when I was six and a half. My daughters are three here sitting in this congregation. They've never seen her. They've never seen her grandma. And she's never seen them. Why did she go? Was it just a death or was there some further purpose? So, I've got to mold this little boy. I've got to mold him. He's got to He's got to go someplace. He's got to go in the strange lands. He's got to live alone a lot of the time. There's other people here. And I don't want to start naming names. But I can tell you the loss. The loss of life to us is one thing but to our father is quite another. And when I think in terms and I want you to think in terms when you can look at just utter such sadness and hear the words tender hand of Jehovah, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It'll change you. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you hear the words, you didn't invent the words and they didn't come out of Bible school. &gt;&gt; Came from God. Came from eternity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Said, I give you and to them was given white robes. &gt;&gt; I want to have one. &gt;&gt; I want to have what the word has promised &gt;&gt; and I believe that we will. God bless you and thank you for your patience. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bless you. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads, please. Dear Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, my Lord and my God, Father which are in heaven, a God that whose thoughts have been made known. And now I have spoken some of the things which have been strange. I know they've been strange to the people. I know that they're going to ponder them and they're going to think about them and they may have questions about them. But Lord, I in the quietness of this moment, I'm asking you to do something very substantial within the lives, within the souls and the hearts of this congregation that s that is seated here before me. I pray, oh God, that you will move them in an eternal realm. Oh, Father God, move them, I pray, into a realm of understanding in a place, oh God, where they will understand. And we want to understand your thoughts and understand why you do certain things. We don't need to know, but we say you do all things well. &gt;&gt; We say bless your name. I thank you, Father. I thank you so much in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's that song we used to say? Uh, I can almost see the lights of home. I can almost see the lights of home. Is Donnie Rambo's song? &gt;&gt; Is that the lights of home? Yeah. Do you know that, Brother Ryan? Is that the lights of home? Is that the lights of home?
