[2:11] Everything you need.
[2:16] He's already provided.
[2:24] Amen. Hallelujah. thankful for the
[2:26] provision of our Lord Jesus. And
[2:30] it's just so happy to see a few more
[2:32] that have gathered here. And I don't
[2:35] feel like I'm singing a solo anymore.
[2:39] Well, it's wonderful just to fellowship
[2:41] together and we greet everyone that is
[2:44] streaming with us this morning. Maybe we
[2:47] could start singing uh My Sheep Know My
[2:49] Voice. Brother Ed's going to be
[2:51] ministering unto us. We're looking
[2:53] forward to that. We have a special
[2:57] and so we just want to worship the Lord.
[3:00] Amen. Praise the Lord together.
[3:04] Glad to be one of his sheep. One of the
[3:07] Lord's sheep. And he's the great
[3:09] shepherd that has spoken to us in this
[3:12] age. And we have heard his voice. Amen.
[3:15] My sheep know my voice. My sheep know my
[3:20] voice. And the path that I take,
[3:26] they follow wherever
[3:29] I go.
[3:33] My sheep know my voice and come at my
[3:40] call. But a stranger's voice do they not
[3:45] know.
[3:49] My sheep
[3:52] know my voice
[3:56] and day
[4:00] by day
[4:04] they abide
[4:07] in the f
[4:11] and go
[4:14] on a straight
[4:16] [Music]
[4:18] They love
[4:21] me because
[4:25] I have made
[4:28] him my choice
[4:32] and they follow
[4:36] my call.
[4:39] For my sheep
[4:42] know my voice.
[4:46] My sheep know my voice and the pastures
[4:52] of green where I lead them so often to
[4:57] feed.
[5:00] My sheep know my voice and the cool
[5:05] sparkling stream. Where beside it still
[5:10] waters I lead.
[5:15] My sheep
[5:18] know my voice
[5:22] and
[5:25] I need
[5:29] abide
[5:32] in the f
[5:36] and go
[5:37] [Music]
[5:38] not a stray.
[5:43] They love
[5:45] me because
[5:49] I have made
[5:52] them my choice
[5:56] and they follow
[6:00] my call.
[6:03] For my sheep
[6:06] know my voice.
[6:10] My sheep know my voice and the valley of
[6:16] death through which I shall lead them
[6:21] someday.
[6:24] But no danger nor harm can touch one of
[6:30] them for I will be with them all.
[6:38] My sheep
[6:41] know my voice.
[6:45] And day
[6:48] by day
[6:52] they abide
[6:55] in the f
[6:58] and go
[7:01] not astray.
[7:05] They love
[7:08] me because
[7:11] I have made
[7:15] him my choice.
[7:18] And they follow
[7:22] my call
[7:25] for my sheep.
[7:28] Know my voice.
[7:34] And so I'll cherish
[7:36] [Music]
[7:37] the old rugged cross
[7:44] till my trophies
[7:47] at last I lay down.
[7:53] And I will cling
[7:56] to the old rugged cross
[8:02] and exchange
[8:04] it someday for a crown on a hill.
[8:11] On a hill far away stood an old rugged
[8:19] cross.
[8:21] the emblem of suffering
[8:25] and shame.
[8:29] And
[8:31] that old cross where the dearest
[8:36] and best for our world of lost sinners
[8:42] was slain.
[8:45] And so I'll chase
[8:49] the old rugged cross
[8:54] till I drove
[8:57] that last highly down.
[9:03] I will cling
[9:05] to the old rugged cross
[9:11] and exchange it someday for a crown.
[9:18] [Music]
[9:20] Oh, that old rugged cross so despised
[9:26] by the world has a wondrous
[9:31] attraction
[9:33] for me.
[9:36] For the dear lamb of God left his glory
[9:44] above
[9:45] to bear it to dark calary.
[9:53] And so I'll cherish
[9:56] the old rug cross
[10:02] till my trophies
[10:05] at last I lay down.
[10:11] I will cling
[10:13] to the old rugged cross
[10:19] and exchange it someday for a crown to
[10:25] the old rugged cross to the old rugged
[10:31] cross
[10:32] I will ever
[10:35] be true
[10:37] in shame and reproach glad gladly bear.
[10:44] Then he'll call me someday
[10:49] to my home far away
[10:53] where is glory
[10:56] forever
[10:58] I'll share.
[11:01] And so I'll cherish
[11:04] the old rugged cross.
[11:10] Till my trophies
[11:13] at last I lay down.
[11:18] I will cling
[11:21] to the old rubbing cross
[11:27] and exchange it someday
[11:32] for a crown.
[11:36] Just play that softly.
[11:39] Tom, I'm going to ask you to come and uh
[11:42] take the requests and uh make a couple
[11:45] of announcements. We just have um read
[11:48] the requests just before he comes.
[11:52] Um
[11:54] Brother David Daniels
[11:58] is requesting prayer for a relative who
[12:00] was injured in a motorcycle accident in
[12:02] Edmonton who's in the hospital. So, we
[12:05] just want to remember that in prayer.
[12:06] And sister Ellaner Drake
[12:09] is also requesting prayer for one of her
[12:12] siblings who has just found out they
[12:15] have cancer. And sister Ellaner also is
[12:19] praying for the healing of the soul of
[12:22] this individual. So we just want to take
[12:24] that. All right, brother Tom.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; Good morning saints. Why don't we just
[12:34] all stand before we go to before the
[12:36] throne of grace? Sister Elellaner, she
[12:39] had called and talked with Sister Joanne
[12:41] and burdened not just because uh a
[12:44] brother has cancer of the body, but
[12:47] she's burdened to see the salvation of
[12:49] her of a soul. And so now collectively
[12:53] as we are here gathered together this
[12:55] morning, let's just bind our hearts and
[12:56] and pray. And that also was for uh
[13:00] brother David Daniels. Um was that just
[13:05] a friend?
[13:06] &gt;&gt; A relative. Okay. Let's bow our heads in
[13:09] a word of prayer.
[13:13] Father, whenever there was needs when
[13:15] you fashioned and formed a body and
[13:18] lived in a temple called Jesus Christ,
[13:23] Lord, wherever you pass, the scripture
[13:25] so often says, "And you healed every one
[13:27] of them."
[13:29] Lord, we believe that you're the same
[13:31] yesterday, today, and forever.
[13:35] Lord, we're all standing here in need.
[13:38] We're all standing here burdened. We're
[13:40] all standing here looking to the lamb of
[13:43] God that can take every one of these
[13:45] burdens and needs, dissolve them, and
[13:49] make all things turn out well.
[13:52] And so, Father, our hearts are are
[13:55] beating in anticipation of the the
[13:58] fulfillment of our prayers because we
[14:01] don't pray a miss. We pray with intent
[14:03] and purpose.
[14:05] We pray God for Sister Allaner's
[14:07] brother, needy in body. And we could
[14:10] say, "We're all needy in body, but we
[14:12] need the master to come and touch his
[14:15] soul." That he would look heavenward,
[14:17] Lord. That he wouldn't look at a monitor
[14:19] or look at results of a doctor, but he
[14:21] would look at Calvary and realize his
[14:24] need in Christ Jesus. So, Father, I'm
[14:27] asking wherever he is today that there
[14:30] would be an awakening like the prodal
[14:32] had. He awoken to himself. And your
[14:35] prophet said an angel touched him and
[14:38] said, "Get going, boy. Lord, would you
[14:40] just touch him and may there be an
[14:43] awakening and an awareness of his need
[14:45] in Christ Jesus?" Also for brother David
[14:48] Daniels and his relative, Lord, I pray
[14:51] God that you will undertake in your own
[14:54] special way. You're the great physician
[14:57] and you can create and lord do whatever
[15:00] is needed to put body, spirit, and soul
[15:04] back together for the glory of God.
[15:07] We're here on Father's Day. The world
[15:09] calls it Father's Day. So, heavenly
[15:11] father, we glorify you today as we do
[15:14] day by day. And we pray, Lord, that you
[15:17] will bless the father of this work here,
[15:21] Lord. Brother Biscll, a man of God, a
[15:24] pastor, one that has been used and led
[15:27] by the Holy Spirit. I pray Lord, you
[15:30] will strengthen him, that you will
[15:32] anoint him, that the word of God will
[15:35] infold him, that you will strengthen him
[15:38] to speak words of life to each and every
[15:41] one of us that has joined together.
[15:44] Lord, brothers and and sisters that have
[15:46] tied in on way of the internet, may it
[15:49] be a special day as we Lord look to you
[15:53] to speak to every heart. We commit now
[15:56] this service to you in Jesus' name.
[15:59] Amen. Amen. Why don't you have your
[16:02] seats everyone? I'd like to make a
[16:04] couple of announcements. Maybe you can
[16:06] start playing. I'm amazed that he loves
[16:08] me. I'm amazed.
[16:12] Well, there's a couple of uh events that
[16:15] have taken place while we have been um
[16:18] under the order of of British Columbia's
[16:22] disease and whatever they call it. We've
[16:25] have two additions to the body here at
[16:27] Cloverdale Bible Way. And maybe the
[16:30] first uh slide goes up. It's Tim and
[16:32] Jessica Andy's wish to announce the
[16:36] arrival of their baby girl. And so I'm
[16:39] sure it's a special Father's Day for
[16:41] brother Tim and sister Jessica. The
[16:44] baby's name is Liberty Dawn Andes. Born
[16:48] at 12:50 a.m. June 12th, 8 o 8 lb 10 oz
[16:55] and 20 in. That's all the data for the
[16:58] sisters. So God bless the Andes home.
[17:02] Brother John is becoming a I told him I
[17:04] says you're you be you you obviously
[17:06] been a grandfather and now as they
[17:08] numbers add you're becoming a great
[17:10] grandfather.
[17:11] So God bless the Andes clan and and what
[17:15] God's added to them. Next is David and
[17:18] Linda Adamora. God's blessed their home
[17:20] with Hannah Adamora
[17:23] and born Monday, June 15th at 7:38 a.m.
[17:29] 7 lb 4 oz.
[17:32] The height of this baby, they not say
[17:34] length, the height of the baby is 19.5
[17:37] in. Well, we're we're thankful for
[17:40] healthy babies and healthy mothers.
[17:43] We're thankful for what God has done
[17:45] within the in the church. So, God bless
[17:47] you and and thank you for uh allowing us
[17:50] to see faces that we wouldn't be seeing
[17:52] for a long time.
[17:55] Well, now we're going into another
[17:57] phase. You notice in the church here,
[17:59] isn't it nice to see one another? Now, I
[18:01] used to always say, why don't you just
[18:03] turn to the left and look at brother so
[18:04] and so and look to the right. Well, you
[18:06] can do that today. For those that have
[18:09] joined with us, our our family at
[18:11] Cloverdale Bible Way, we are
[18:13] implementing um a part of the next
[18:16] stage. We are allowed to have of course
[18:18] 50 here and um a portion of that 50 is
[18:22] used up with all the precious technical
[18:25] brethren that have labored and musicians
[18:27] that have labored over these last few
[18:29] months and um without their families and
[18:33] they've been here sometimes 6 to 10
[18:35] hours in the day. They'll translate what
[18:38] they've been translating brother
[18:39] Biscll's testimonies and um been without
[18:43] their families for such a long time. And
[18:44] we thought, well, if we move the phase
[18:46] forward, we would love to have those
[18:48] that have been a part and making all
[18:51] this possible by the way of the internet
[18:54] have their families with them on
[18:55] Father's Day. So, if you see a few faces
[18:58] in in the in the pews, it's because
[19:00] we're going to the next phase. So, we're
[19:04] going to by God's grace, we're going to
[19:06] uh have 35 to 40. So, in the local
[19:10] assembly here at Cloverdale Bible Way,
[19:13] we're going to, Lord willing, have 50 at
[19:16] the um at the uh Bible Way Christian
[19:18] Academy at the gymnasium and we will
[19:21] have a screen and and they will be tying
[19:23] into the internet, but so uh they can
[19:26] gather there and we're working with
[19:28] Mount Baker Bible Way Camp Chapel. The
[19:31] camp has been officially closed. It's
[19:33] closed. We are not having camps but uh
[19:37] Governor Eninsley I believe it is in
[19:39] Washington they're moving to phase two.
[19:42] So uh brother Jonathan Frey and the
[19:44] different brothers are working uh with
[19:46] our brethren here so that they can
[19:48] gather at the chapel on the services on
[19:52] the state side. So the brethren brothers
[19:54] and sisters uh on the in Washington we
[19:58] will be letting you know how we're
[20:00] moving forward. So, we're we're going to
[20:02] be um actually sending signal to the
[20:05] camp and receiving s signal from the
[20:08] camp and that's going to be our
[20:09] challenge because then if brother John
[20:12] is ministering, we'd like him to
[20:13] minister at the chapel at Mount Baker
[20:16] and then you can have um whatever
[20:19] numbers they are allowing us apparently
[20:21] we're working with 50% of the allowable
[20:24] assembly and so there's different rules
[20:26] and hurdles we have to uh abide by and
[20:29] we we're abiding by every order that is
[20:32] given by whether it's the state of
[20:34] Washington or the uh province of British
[20:36] Columbia. So being that we are
[20:39] implementing now phase two, the
[20:40] challenge is now to make this work and
[20:44] people feel comfortable. So there will
[20:46] be rules, there will be regulations,
[20:47] some um there'll be handashing, there'll
[20:50] be social distancing, there will be
[20:52] masks that need to be worn. It's not
[20:54] going to be like what we're normally
[20:55] used to. You can't hug, you can't
[20:58] sisters can't hug each other, brothers
[21:00] can't hug each other. Uh you can't shake
[21:02] hands. There will be uh sanitation
[21:04] stations. Um we will be abiding on uh
[21:08] entry to the uh buildings and exit to
[21:10] the buildings. So all these details need
[21:14] to be addressed and um we're going to be
[21:18] taking our our steps forward this week.
[21:21] So don't get all excited and say, "Oh,
[21:23] next Sunday we're going to all be um
[21:25] going to church." Well, there will be
[21:27] portions of you and brother Michael is
[21:30] working with a system right now that you
[21:32] can come to church. It's your turn to
[21:34] come and then you won't be at church
[21:36] maybe for the next time, but you'll be
[21:38] maybe rotated to the gym if you're at
[21:40] the assembly and at the camp that you'll
[21:43] be take given also a ticket or however
[21:46] we work it. So that you'll probably miss
[21:48] maybe a service and maybe you won't
[21:51] depending on what our numbers are.
[21:53] So bear with us when we're trying to
[21:56] figure this all out. Don't jump the gun
[21:59] and say we're going to church on Sunday.
[22:01] You'll be notified by Cloverdale Bible
[22:03] Way office. Whoever's in the office,
[22:05] they'll be notifying you that you'll be
[22:08] will be able to go forward. So if you
[22:10] don't hear from the office, just will
[22:13] continue the way we are. It's a big
[22:15] undertaking
[22:17] and we're just so looking forward to
[22:19] being together. And so today, we've been
[22:22] blessed to be able to have uh those that
[22:25] have been working at the church, their
[22:26] families here on Father's Day. We're
[22:29] blessed to know that you are hearing and
[22:30] the word of God, our pastor will be
[22:33] speaking on this day. And I my heart's
[22:36] thrilled and in anticipation to hear
[22:38] what the word of God has got for us this
[22:40] morning. So, uh if you've got any
[22:43] questions whatsoever regarding this,
[22:46] don't uh jam our phone lines up. We'll
[22:48] be contacting you when we are moving
[22:50] forward in a certain direction. We just
[22:53] want everybody to know we are working
[22:56] the hardest we can so that you can get
[22:59] together with people you have loved and
[23:01] have worshiped with these many years.
[23:04] So, however it unfolds in the next week
[23:07] or week or two, we will um we'll be
[23:10] announcing that to you and thank you for
[23:12] your patience. I mean this has been a
[23:14] trying time for everyone and you've done
[23:18] marvelous but now it's time to have some
[23:21] church. It's time to be with people to
[23:23] worship the true and living God in this
[23:26] great unveiling of God. So our deed the
[23:28] details will be passed along to you via
[23:32] the office and just pray for us that God
[23:35] will give us uh proper guidance on how
[23:38] to do that. So that is my announcement
[23:41] and uh I I I would like you to pray for
[23:44] uh brother Michael. He's doing a lot of
[23:46] juggling in how this is all going to
[23:49] unfold. But I believe in the next few
[23:51] weeks or so we'll be having a wonderful
[23:54] time in the presence of God. Not by
[23:55] ourselves in our homes even though we've
[23:58] been enjoying that but now with a a
[24:00] group of people that God has called us
[24:02] to. So God bless you. Happy Father's Day
[24:05] to all the fathers and may you have a
[24:07] wonderful day in the presence of our
[24:09] Lord Jesus. God bless you brothered
[24:16] that you love me.
[24:19] I'm amazed
[24:24] how you care.
[24:27] Through your preious
[24:30] blood I found pardon. Brother Michael,
[24:34] why don't you come? And my sins are
[24:38] washed. They're all washed away. All my
[24:44] sins
[24:46] are washed
[24:48] away.
[24:50] [Music]
[24:57] &gt;&gt; My goodness, is it good to at least see
[24:59] your face this morning.
[25:01] Welcome to the church this morning. We
[25:05] have a little bit of a different special
[25:06] this morning. That's why I'm up here.
[25:07] I'm not singing a solo. I uh I did that.
[25:11] You'll see uh when we have the special.
[25:14] It's going to be on the screen. But uh I
[25:16] am not a soloist. That's what I found
[25:17] out. Singing a song all by your lonesome
[25:19] is brutal. But uh um this morning we're
[25:24] the special today is a little bit of a
[25:26] tribute to fathers. Um, and it kind of
[25:29] came out of a Marco sent me the link to
[25:33] a song and he said, "This this I think
[25:34] is going to be an anthem." And uh, we
[25:36] listened to it. I said, "Yeah, that's
[25:38] that's a good song. That's an anthem
[25:40] song." And uh, and so as we were just
[25:42] listening to it, then my wife says,
[25:43] "Well, that's a good Father's Day song."
[25:45] So then I thought about that a little
[25:46] bit more and that was at the beginning
[25:47] of the week. And brother Ryan, we've
[25:49] been trying to do a little bit of a
[25:50] virtual special and uh, so we just threw
[25:54] all those thoughts in one bag and shook
[25:56] it up. And this is what came out uh over
[25:59] the last couple days. But um there's
[26:02] been a lot of men, a lot of fathers,
[26:05] whether they're your father or just uh a

[26:12] through your life and they've really uh
[26:14] helped you and you've someone you've
[26:15] respected. And this is what this song
[26:17] is, too. And it uh I told I told my
[26:19] father this morning, I said, "If there's
[26:21] if if no one else was sitting here, this
[26:23] is this is for me to you. This is me to
[26:25] you." And um and I know brother Tom's
[26:28] mentioned we have our pastor who's been
[26:30] a spiritual father for many of us and
[26:32] and uh so this is just a dedic just
[26:34] dedicate that to each one of those
[26:36] special people in our lives that uh
[26:38] they've given much and so this is just
[26:39] an expression of our of our love. I want
[26:41] to thank everyone that worked over the
[26:44] last 24 hours because that's about what
[26:46] we did. Um a big undertaking. Brother

[26:51] late on a couple nights, but so we hope
[26:53] it's a bit of a blessing to you and uh

[26:58] different fashion. So the brothers can
[26:59] cue that up and uh bring the faders up

[27:11] [Laughter]
[27:13] [Music]
[27:24] He was awake before the sun
[27:27] with his Bible opened up,
[27:32] seeking truth. With every single page he
[27:36] turned,
[27:39] anyone could see.
[27:42] My daddy lived what he believed.
[27:45] With a gentle heart, a passion for Jesus
[27:51] burned.
[27:53] I know we had our times we disagree.
[28:00] But the longer I live, it's clear to me
[28:06] I want to be
[28:10] that man.
[28:12] [Applause]
[28:14] who loves the Lord with all his heart,
[28:18] just like the word commands. Who takes
[28:24] a stand
[28:28] and leads his family as he holds the
[28:31] father's hand. I want to be that man.
[28:38] Society
[28:40] [Laughter]
[28:42] [Music]
[28:44] would say
[28:46] there's a new ideal today.
[28:50] Not what you give. It's more about what
[28:53] you can gain.
[28:57] But I want to live a life
[29:01] marked by sacrifice
[29:04] like the Savior who died to show us all
[29:09] the way.
[29:11] So I'll take up my cross and trace his
[29:15] steps.
[29:19] Surrendering is how I'll serve him best.
[29:25] I want to be
[29:29] that man
[29:31] [Music]
[29:33] who loves the Lord with all his heart
[29:36] just like the word command
[29:42] [Music]
[29:46] and he's
[29:49] hold
[29:52] I want to be that
[29:57] Just like Peter B and all the saints of
[30:02] days gone by.
[30:05] Let me show the kind of faith to those
[30:09] who come behind.
[30:15] I want to be
[30:20] [Applause]
[30:21] Yeah.
[30:28] [Music]
[30:31] [Applause]
[30:33] I
[30:37] need
[30:39] your
[30:42] I want to be
[30:44] [Applause]
[30:47] I
[30:49] [Music]
[30:53] want to be there.
[30:57] [Music]
[31:07] [Music]
[31:27] [Applause]
[31:35] Wow, that's amazing.
[31:38] We sure appreciate all the effort and
[31:42] the work that went into that and just
[31:45] see it come together and
[31:47] praise to our fathers and to our
[31:49] heavenly father most of all. We're so
[31:51] thankful for that.
[31:53] Now, I'd like to invite our pastor,
[31:56] Brother Ed, to come and minister unto
[31:59] us. And
[32:01] I just feel like we want to maybe stand
[32:04] together and
[32:06] just sing together. I pledge allegiance
[32:08] to the Lamb.
[32:12] I pledge
[32:14] allegiance
[32:17] to the lamb.
[32:20] With all my strength,
[32:24] with all I am, I will seek to honor
[32:32] his command.
[32:36] I pledge
[32:38] alce
[32:40] to
[32:43] the lamb.
[32:45] [Music]
[32:46] I have heard I have heard
[32:49] how Christians
[32:51] long ago
[32:55] were brought before
[32:58] a tyrant
[33:00] throne. They were told that he
[33:06] would spare their lives if they would
[33:11] renounce
[33:13] the name
[33:15] of Christ.
[33:17] But one by one
[33:20] they chose to die
[33:24] the son of God.
[33:28] not deny
[33:31] like a great angelic
[33:35] choir
[33:37] sings.
[33:38] I can almost hear their voicees
[33:45] ring. I pledge
[33:48] allegiance
[33:50] to the lamb
[33:53] with all my strength.
[33:56] With all I am, I will seek to honor
[34:04] his command.
[34:07] I pledge
[34:09] alce
[34:11] to
[34:13] to the lamb of God
[34:17] to the lamb of God
[34:21] who bore my face.
[34:25] You took my place
[34:28] and all my shame. I will sing to honor
[34:35] his command.
[34:38] I pledge
[34:40] alleus.
[34:42] [Music]
[34:50] I'd like you to sing to be like Jesus.
[34:57] [Music]
[35:05] all my Lord
[35:10] to be like him
[35:15] all through life's journey
[35:20] from earth to glory. Glory.
[35:26] I only ask
[35:30] you to be like him.
[35:34] Amen. Thank you, brother Nathan.
[35:38] God bless you each one. Thank you for
[35:40] being here. And we want to say greetings
[35:45] to all of those that are streaming. And
[35:47] we know there's many more
[35:50] out in their homes and streaming out in
[35:53] other places. And we just say God bless
[35:57] you. We're so thankful to be able to do
[36:00] that. Uh
[36:03] I'll have you take your Bibles if you
[36:06] would. And I want to thank you. Thank
[36:10] the musicians. We we're done now.
[36:16] I will have you turn
[36:19] to uh
[36:21] Matthew the 11th chapter
[36:25] and I want to start
[36:28] there. uh
[36:30] the service I would like you to pay
[36:33] strict attention and if you haven't got
[36:37] uh a pen maybe you could borrow one from
[36:40] someone and find a piece of paper I
[36:45] trust you'll have one and uh what I'd
[36:49] like you to do
[36:51] today is and you in the homes you have a
[36:56] better opportunity to get a piece of
[36:59] paper and have it with you. And I would
[37:04] like to ask you, especially young
[37:07] people, if you, my wife said, well, a
[37:12] lot of the young people make notes.
[37:14] Well, it isn't just to make notes, but
[37:18] it is to put a question down that you
[37:21] might have a question or you might have
[37:24] uh I might say something and then you'll
[37:27] catch it right away. We're going to
[37:29] catch it right in the first part of the
[37:32] reading of the scripture.
[37:34] And um
[37:37] because even if you put down something
[37:40] that just speaks to you or something
[37:43] that you can think about
[37:46] uh or something that you don't
[37:50] understand
[37:51] then uh or just how it connects because
[37:56] I am I'm speaking about things that I
[37:59] have thought about for a long time a lot
[38:03] of s and uh so now I want you to receive
[38:07] the most and the best out of everything
[38:12] that is said and done. And uh when I saw
[38:16] the screen and you know it it came out
[38:20] and I see four or five people singing
[38:24] maybe sing or more six or more singing.
[38:27] I thought, "Well, why don't they just
[38:30] plug me in there and then
[38:34] and then I could be done. I'd be done by
[38:37] the time they're all finished and I'll
[38:39] be done, too." Well, it just doesn't
[38:43] work that way. Everybody has to do their
[38:45] part. But I would like to be the man
[38:48] that could put all that together. And so
[38:52] God bless our technicians
[38:56] for putting that together.
[38:59] Thank you, brother Tom, for greeting our
[39:02] fathers.
[39:04] And I thought of a scripture which I I
[39:06] think of it often. And I think of it
[39:09] every day when I awake and I think I'm
[39:13] so glad
[39:15] that we can say our father
[39:19] which art in heaven
[39:21] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come.
[39:26] That's those are the most priceless
[39:29] words that we can say. Our Father, thy
[39:33] will be done
[39:36] on earth as it is in heaven. It's the
[39:39] greatest thing we can do. And so I'm
[39:43] going to be reading out of Matthew the
[39:46] 11th chapter. if you'd like to turn to
[39:49] it.
[39:59] And what I would like to do today is I'm
[40:03] going to read a number of quotes
[40:07] and I'm going to have a number of slides
[40:10] up.
[40:11] And the reason for the slides is because
[40:14] I want to
[40:16] emphasize sometimes just a word, one
[40:20] word, it'll change the entire concept of
[40:27] of uh when was it that he said that?
[40:31] Uh and and why is he bringing it that
[40:35] way? And then you'll find out that he
[40:39] did it with Abraham and then he did it
[40:42] when he was here on earth. And then
[40:44] you'll find he did it in the prophets's
[40:47] ministry.
[40:48] And it's when you start seeing that
[40:53] uh
[40:56] it's not something to be idle about.
[40:59] It's not something to be casual about.
[41:02] Saying, "Well, I'm trying I think you're
[41:04] trying to say something to us,
[41:07] &gt;&gt; and that's where I'm really at." And
[41:11] that I'm being honest with you. That's
[41:14] that's where I as a as a father as
[41:19] someone they say well you've had such a
[41:22] vision and and uh well all of that but
[41:25] that came from someone and he had to put
[41:29] it in a person's heart and had to gather
[41:32] others around that would be there to
[41:37] assist you otherwise you never never
[41:40] ever come up with it and Uh, so you just
[41:44] see all the all the people singing and
[41:47] all the people contributing
[41:51] and I'm sure there's many hearts of
[41:54] fathers that's welled up with thanks but
[41:58] thanks thanks to who? Who brought this
[42:01] about who did this? It wasn't it wasn't
[42:05] our good doing you know that sometimes
[42:08] we didn't even know as fathers we don't
[42:11] even know what to do or in the present
[42:14] situation we don't know what exactly
[42:16] what to do but God still leads his dear
[42:20] children along some might be in prison
[42:23] some might be in in persecution some
[42:27] might be in great need and uh we're so
[42:31] thankful we have a God that remembers
[42:34] us. And when I speak of need, you know
[42:38] that in the last two, three weeks, we
[42:41] had our brother, our p our deacon
[42:45] brother Leon
[42:48] Garling Garin
[42:51] uh
[42:53] they had a fire and he lost everything,
[42:56] lost his tools. Well, the people of the
[42:59] church as soon as it was announced came
[43:02] together and brother Norm and Sister
[43:05] Louise Woods gave craftsman's tools
[43:09] and said, you know, uh, take what you
[43:13] need
[43:15] and just they're brand new in the cases
[43:20] and just take what you need and you
[43:22] know, we'll take back whatever you don't
[43:24] need and and And we just through press
[43:29] pay or whatever. I have never used press
[43:32] pay in my life, but um punch pray or
[43:38] you want to be able to pray when you
[43:40] when you push that button when you touch
[43:43] it. But uh people for
[43:48] um they gave over $4,000
[43:52] in just a few days. So, brother Tom
[43:55] said, "Would you like to give it to
[43:57] brother
[43:58] um Leon?" And I said, "Well, yeah, I
[44:02] think probably so, but uh let's leave it
[44:06] till the weekend." That's this weekend.
[44:09] And by this weekend, I I drove over to
[44:12] his house yesterday and gave him $8,250,
[44:17] which just came into the office. Nobody
[44:20] made any big plea or any. And uh so he
[44:24] has enough to buy his his used pickup
[44:27] which he had in the place and he has
[44:31] enough to buy some tools as well. And I
[44:34] said, "You can just go and buy what
[44:36] tools you need, what tools you want."
[44:38] And apparently there's others here in
[44:41] the congregation that gave gifts of
[44:43] money. And he told me uh something about
[44:46] that. And so uh I just said, "Well,
[44:50] that's that's really wonderful." You
[44:52] know, it's really wonderful that people
[44:54] of the congregation,
[44:57] if we all suffer, it's not just some
[44:59] words. It's it's something that comes
[45:02] from the heart. And uh and here here
[45:04] here
[45:06] are people who have given I'm looking at
[45:08] tools, brand new, beautiful tools and
[45:12] craftsman tools. And I didn't even know
[45:16] they had given them. But here it's been
[45:19] given to the people by the people. So we
[45:22] want to thank God for for that. Let's
[45:25] just have a word of prayer. Heavenly
[45:28] Father, you are our father. And we say
[45:33] uh with our Lord Jesus who has
[45:36] instructed us, our father which art in
[45:40] heaven, hallowed be thy name. And we say
[45:46] with full desire, "Thy kingdom come and
[45:51] thy will be done." Whatever it is, it's
[45:55] not our will, but thy will be done on
[45:59] earth as it is in heaven. Oh God, take
[46:03] your word this morning. Give us
[46:05] understanding. We pray in the name of
[46:08] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[46:14] in the 11th chapter
[46:17] of Matthew,
[46:19] I'm I'm going to start to read at the
[46:22] 20th verse. And uh
[46:30] and I'm going to emphasize
[46:34] the the first word.
[46:37] Uh I excuse me. I have a lot of
[46:40] different notes here and uh
[46:47] so as
[46:54] the 11th chapter
[46:57] and the 20th verse
[47:19] 1120.
[47:33] Then began he to upgrade the cities
[47:38] wherein most of his mighty works were
[47:40] done because they repented not.
[47:45] Uh I want to emphasize
[47:49] the word then.
[47:52] It's not before. It's not the day
[47:54] before. It's not the week or two before.
[47:56] It is now he is going to upgrade the
[48:02] cities where most of his mighty works
[48:04] were done.
[48:06] And uh
[48:09] when most of his mighty works were done
[48:13] because they repented not. Woe unto thee
[48:18] Charisen.
[48:20] Joine, I think it is. Woe unto thee,
[48:24] Bethesda,
[48:26] for if the mighty works which were done
[48:29] in you had been done in Ty and Siden,
[48:35] they would have repented long ago in
[48:39] sackcl sackcloth and ashes. Really,
[48:44] they would have if they had seen those
[48:47] works.
[48:48] And if we bring it forth to to this day,
[48:53] I'm going to be
[48:57] uh having you read with me several
[48:59] quotes. I'll have it on the screen.
[49:03] We have had one of the most outstanding
[49:07] when
[49:08] now you young people you listen. I was
[49:13] 14
[49:15] when I said, "I have never heard I've
[49:20] never seen a man that has talked to an
[49:24] angel." And in a few minutes, he came
[49:26] out and he was standing like I'm
[49:28] standing at this platform and you're
[49:31] standing where you are. I was down two,
[49:35] three seats from the front and I
[49:38] thought, I want to get as close to this
[49:41] as I can.
[49:44] Nothing's ever changed. Nothing's ever
[49:47] changed. If I were some of the cities
[49:50] and I
[49:53] I saw where brother Brandham was in
[49:56] Phoenix and Phoenix and Phoenix and
[49:59] Phoenix and he was in Shreveport and in
[50:02] Shreveport and Shreveport. If I were
[50:07] someone in those cities,
[50:10] I'd really be asking myself,
[50:13] what is my position about what he said
[50:16] here?
[50:18] Because then he began to upgrade
[50:24] and he be to correct. He begin to speak
[50:27] more harshly
[50:29] to these places.
[50:32] He said, "And if Sodom had seen these
[50:36] things, they would have repented in
[50:39] sackcloth and ashes."
[50:42] You mean to tell me that we've seen even
[50:45] things in this day?
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; We've actually seen things. We've heard
[50:52] things. And it doesn't touch us. And if
[50:58] Sodom, Sodom and all of their evil
[51:01] vulgarity, if they had seen these
[51:05] things, they would have repented in
[51:08] sackcloth and ashes a long time ago. And
[51:13] uh the reason why I'm quite moved,
[51:16] exercised about this is because
[51:21] I think that
[51:24] we're going the wrong direction. I think
[51:26] that a lot of people who have heard the
[51:28] message, oh, they're in the message and
[51:30] they're
[51:32] I don't think so.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; I don't think they're in the message. I
[51:37] don't think they have the message in
[51:39] them. Uh there's a lot of people that
[51:42] I've heard, well, oh, they they just
[51:46] take things so glibly.
[51:49] It's just like I I have it. The world
[51:53] owes me a living. And and so I want us
[51:56] to look at it differently.
[51:59] And in this 11th chapter of Matthew,
[52:05] now I'm just setting a bit of a a
[52:07] course, but in this 11th chapter of
[52:09] Matthew from the 20th verse on down
[52:13] through, and uh
[52:19] he he is taking
[52:23] the same position.
[52:38] and then verse 25,
[52:42] at that time,
[52:46] not the day before,
[52:49] but at that time,
[52:53] then he had just upgraded these cities.
[52:58] And then at that time Jesus answered and
[53:01] said, "I thank thee, oh Father,
[53:05] Lord of heaven and earth,
[53:10] because thou hast hid these things."
[53:14] What was it? He hid
[53:18] the revealing of the Son of Man. He hid
[53:22] He hid that. He hid these things from
[53:25] the wise and the prudent, and has
[53:28] revealed them unto babes. Even so,
[53:32] Father,
[53:34] for so it seemed good in thy sight. So
[53:39] it seemed good that he would hide. I
[53:43] want to say just before I let you sit
[53:45] down,
[53:47] I think that the message, this is what I
[53:50] think. I think that the message which we
[53:52] call the message
[53:54] is
[53:56] is perhaps filled with secrets and there
[54:01] are some that are you know spending
[54:04] their time finding mistakes that
[54:07] whatever more I think they would do a
[54:10] lot better if they would find the
[54:13] secrets and the hidden treasures
[54:17] &gt;&gt; that are hidden in the scripture.
[54:20] scripture and and they're hidden in the
[54:24] Bible like I don't know if you've ever
[54:26] seen
[54:29] if it's ever ever registered in your
[54:32] heart but then Jesus began to upgrade
[54:36] this cities and which cities are they
[54:42] and then I began to read I can read it
[54:46] in the Old Testament and 3 4,000 years.
[54:50] I read it again and I can see it clearly
[54:54] and I say, "Here we are a couple
[54:56] thousand years down the road and we see
[54:59] exactly the same thing. We have the same
[55:02] ministry." And and it was Tommy Osburn
[55:05] that said at brother Brandham's
[55:06] memorial, he said, "Now, you won't see
[55:10] this again.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Where where is this God that did these
[55:18] things?"
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:20] you won't see these things again.
[55:23] And how and do we have to have a a
[55:25] Pentecostal man tell the people
[55:30] you won't see this again?
[55:32] He said, "I saw it once and I just I
[55:36] just went
[55:40] and uh I used to give to Tommy Osburn's
[55:44] Tommy Osbbor's
[55:46] native evangelism because when I saw it,
[55:49] I said, you know, that makes so much
[55:53] sense.
[55:55] Send it to the native people. Send it to
[55:58] them. They don't have to have they don't
[56:02] have to learn another language. They
[56:03] don't have to
[56:05] learn how to sleep different or being in
[56:09] different have different food or
[56:11] whatever more. Just do it. And so I
[56:14] thought that's the way to do it. And
[56:16] when I was in Toronto, yeah, just a few
[56:18] years ago, I would gave and Tommy
[56:22] Osbborne came and and then I saw Brother
[56:25] Brandham when he talked about that and
[56:28] he said, "That's the way to do it." And
[56:31] I just thought, my what caused me to
[56:36] become involved in that way back then?
[56:39] And then
[56:42] then I can say, "He leadeth me." Amen.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; By his own hand he leadth me. And and I
[56:50] want to say to you that are here and to
[56:52] you that are streaming.
[56:56] You can say that because God, the God
[57:00] that you surrender your life to is going
[57:03] to direct your footsteps and he'll
[57:06] direct your decisions in a way that will
[57:10] mystify you on down the road. So God
[57:14] bless you as you have your seats.
[57:32] So Michael, you might have to
[57:40] I just use this.
[57:42] All right.
[57:50] It's hard for me to see that. Oh, look
[57:53] at this one right here.
[57:59] So, I have highlighted
[58:02] and so that you can then
[58:07] he began to upgrade. And the reason I
[58:09] want you to pay strict attention to that
[58:12] is I will be emphasizing some words
[58:19] and you think this is a school class.
[58:22] Well, it is and perhaps a lot more.
[58:28] And and I highlighted also
[58:33] most of his mighty works were done.
[58:37] That's Jesus talking.
[58:41] Jesus is
[58:43] bringing those
[58:45] and look because of those mighty works
[58:49] that were done.
[58:52] Woe unto thee
[58:54] Corazine.
[58:56] Woe unto thee Bethesda. For if the
[58:59] mighty works which were done in you
[59:03] had been done in Ty and Sidden, they
[59:06] would have repented long ago in
[59:09] sackcloth and ashes. And thou Capernium
[59:13] and I want to say
[59:16] the city of angels.
[59:19] I just saw
[59:21] on the on the internet. It was actually
[59:25] on a computer. I saw the riots
[59:29] because they played a documentary of the
[59:32] riots
[59:34] in uh Los Angeles
[59:38] and I thought city of angels.
[59:43] No, I thought it must be city of fallen
[59:46] angels.
[59:48] There isn't even fallen angels that act
[59:51] like animals.
[59:53] And it it was it completely the entire
[59:57] city was out of control.
[1:00:01] That's not
[1:00:03] that's not in some other country. That's
[1:00:06] here in America.
[1:00:09] And there's 300,000
[1:00:12] uh 300,000 plus
[1:00:16] 350,000
[1:00:18] Koreans that live in an area and they
[1:00:21] have stores and shops and markets and so
[1:00:24] on. And the people who didn't have any
[1:00:28] any connection with it at all, they tore
[1:00:31] into those places and threw things
[1:00:34] through the glass doors and the they
[1:00:37] called the military in. and the military
[1:00:39] couldn't even stop it and they burned up
[1:00:42] and and one woman while uh my wife was
[1:00:46] sitting there and I felt bad about it
[1:00:48] because uh uh the woman just cried and
[1:00:54] the black man came out against the black
[1:00:57] people and he said it's wrong it's wrong
[1:01:01] this isn't right this isn't right and
[1:01:05] and then if a minister gets up behind
[1:01:08] the pulp it and says city of fallen
[1:01:10] angels.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; They say, "Well, he's cuckoo something."
[1:01:16] Well, what are these people? What are
[1:01:18] they?
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; This isn't We're not talking about
[1:01:21] something that's a long time ago. So,
[1:01:23] I'm preaching to you on Father's Day.
[1:01:26] And I'm I'm preaching to you something
[1:01:28] that happened in your time. This is just
[1:01:31] a few years ago, a very short time ago.
[1:01:35] and and uh uh uh a man by the name of
[1:01:38] Rodney King. He he was he was brutally
[1:01:42] beaten and so on so forth. This Rodney
[1:01:45] King himself got up before his own
[1:01:48] people and came right into the court and
[1:01:52] simply said this this isn't the way to
[1:01:55] act. This isn't the solution.
[1:01:59] even the man that was beaten up and the
[1:02:01] people want to detail every every aspect
[1:02:05] of it. Listen, I'm talking about real
[1:02:08] things and and I'm going to come to
[1:02:12] I'm going to come to rapture
[1:02:16] because I think that's something that's
[1:02:18] on everybody's mind,
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; the rapture.
[1:02:24] So, I want you to listen to every word
[1:02:27] and if we get a little long, we'll just
[1:02:31] stand up and refresh ourselves and and
[1:02:34] carry on.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:02:40] And at that time, Jesus answered, "At
[1:02:43] that time,
[1:02:45] after they had seen the great works,
[1:02:49] and these cities were in his mighty
[1:02:52] works had been done." At that time,
[1:02:55] Jesus answered and said, "I thank thee,
[1:02:58] oh Father,
[1:03:00] that you've hid these things. You've hid
[1:03:04] heaven and earth because thou hast hid
[1:03:07] these things. What did he hide? You know
[1:03:11] the thing that he really hid
[1:03:14] the he hid
[1:03:16] the coming of Christ,
[1:03:19] the recognizing of Jesus Christ. And I
[1:03:23] want you to hold that word because I'm
[1:03:26] I'm coming down to it in just a moment.
[1:03:36] Now this is 1964
[1:03:39] Jehovah Gyra second part in in
[1:03:44] Louisville.
[1:03:46] Notice after the appearing of appearing
[1:03:50] in this name of almighty God, it was
[1:03:55] revealed to him that he was the
[1:03:58] allsufficient one. He had no helpers. He
[1:04:03] didn't need any any secretaries. He was
[1:04:07] alone. God
[1:04:10] he was God alone. And he appeared to
[1:04:14] Abraham.
[1:04:16] And now I'd like you to notice who he
[1:04:18] appeared to. He appeared to Abraham. I'm
[1:04:21] going to go back there. We're going to
[1:04:23] read in just a moment.
[1:04:26] In this name. And while he appeared to
[1:04:29] him in this name and Abraham recognized
[1:04:34] who he was,
[1:04:37] he changed Abraham's name. Now he's come
[1:04:42] to the fullness of believing. Now see
[1:04:46] where the church has come is 1964.
[1:04:50] See where the church has come. I hope
[1:04:53] you can read between the lines. Come up
[1:04:56] to the place where to where he's
[1:05:00] revealed
[1:05:01] to him who he was.
[1:05:05] Come up to the place.
[1:05:07] And friends,
[1:05:09] in this message right now that we have,
[1:05:13] we've had a ministry
[1:05:15] unlike any ministry. When have you had
[1:05:20] a preacher stand behind the pulpit and
[1:05:23] call people by their name and tell them
[1:05:26] where they live and tell them their
[1:05:28] house number?
[1:05:30] When have you had that? It's happened in
[1:05:34] We're not reading history now. We're
[1:05:36] reading your time. That's happened right
[1:05:40] in our time. That's happened to people.
[1:05:44] That's that's perhaps you haven't had
[1:05:47] it. I have had it. And I'm not someone
[1:05:51] that tells untruth.
[1:05:53] I'm telling you something that has
[1:05:56] happened in your time. This is the
[1:05:59] ministry that has taken a hold of your
[1:06:03] heart. And that's the same Holy Spirit
[1:06:07] that's taking a hold of your heart. And
[1:06:10] and because he is saying the same thing,
[1:06:14] he's desiring to reveal himself to you.
[1:06:19] And so he uses a a vessel and and that I
[1:06:24] will.
[1:06:28] I hope I hope I can
[1:06:32] speak to you plainly
[1:06:36] without having you feel that.
[1:06:40] So now he's he he we'll go back to the
[1:06:45] 18th chapter of uh of of Exod of
[1:06:50] Genesis. The 18th chapter of Genesis
[1:07:15] And we want to get the scene here.
[1:07:18] I hope you're feel fine.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Okay, we just want to get the scene. And
[1:07:25] the Lord appeared. This is starting with
[1:07:27] verse one, Genesis 18. And the Lord
[1:07:31] appeared unto him in the plains of
[1:07:35] Mamor,
[1:07:36] and he sat and he sat in the tent door
[1:07:41] of the in the heat of the day.
[1:07:45] And he lift up his eyes and looked, and
[1:07:48] lo, three men stood by him.
[1:07:53] You know, I I had some problem. I don't
[1:07:56] have any problem at all. I just read it
[1:07:58] and say, "Well, that's what happened."
[1:08:01] They they they stood by him uh
[1:08:04] scientifically. How did it happen? I
[1:08:06] don't know. But, uh that's there was
[1:08:09] things that occurred
[1:08:12] while I was with brother Brandon. What
[1:08:14] happened right in this day. And there's
[1:08:16] things that happened in all kinds of
[1:08:18] these cities. And you you'll never never
[1:08:21] never
[1:08:23] ever be able to scientifically put it.
[1:08:27] Now, how how did he's sitting in his
[1:08:30] tent door and three men are standing by
[1:08:33] him
[1:08:35] in he he's sitting in the tent door in
[1:08:37] the heat of the day. And he lift up his
[1:08:40] eyes and looked and lo, three men stood
[1:08:44] by him.
[1:08:46] And when he saw them, he ran to meet
[1:08:49] them.
[1:08:51] Well, were they by him or were they just
[1:08:54] coming?
[1:08:57] And uh
[1:09:00] he ran to meet them from the tent door
[1:09:04] and bowed himself toward the ground and
[1:09:08] said, "My Lord,
[1:09:11] if now I have found favor in thy sight,
[1:09:15] pass not away, I pray thee, from thy
[1:09:18] servant."
[1:09:22] I just want to say to you
[1:09:30] when I've concluded
[1:09:32] maybe you will say you know I think it's
[1:09:35] time for brother Biscll to be put out to
[1:09:39] pasture
[1:09:42] but I want to jar your memory. Maybe you
[1:09:46] need to go out to pasture with me.
[1:09:50] It might there might be a whole lot more
[1:09:52] here. I'm I'm going to come down to a
[1:09:55] verse
[1:09:58] in just a moment.
[1:10:01] I'm just setting the stage right now.
[1:10:06] Let let a little water, this is verse
[1:10:08] four, let a little water, I pray you, be
[1:10:13] fetched and wash your feet and rest
[1:10:18] yourselves under the tree.
[1:10:22] None of this is staggering.
[1:10:25] None of this is earth shaking stuff.
[1:10:29] This is like the Sarapheneician woman
[1:10:32] said uh
[1:10:35] spoke to her husband. She said, "Can't
[1:10:38] we just make a little place for this man
[1:10:41] of God to rest?"
[1:10:46] Uh what different is that from the
[1:10:50] person you're looking at saying, "Uh,
[1:10:56] well, I I I live in the wilderness. I
[1:10:58] can take him hunting.
[1:11:02] I would like to just take him and his
[1:11:04] son maybe for a rest, but especially for
[1:11:08] this man of God. I don't know if he
[1:11:10] would even
[1:11:12] see the letter. I write and I I take a
[1:11:16] pen and I start to write actually a
[1:11:18] pencil I think it was. I write at a big
[1:11:21] old oak desk I picked up someplace
[1:11:25] and uh I I scratch this letter and while
[1:11:29] I'm scratching it
[1:11:31] I that you look at I scratch it and I
[1:11:36] say he'll never see he'll never get he
[1:11:39] probably gets a 100,000 of these a
[1:11:41] month. He'll never see this. And then
[1:11:48] events happen in our lives,
[1:11:52] earth shaking events. Well, then we I
[1:11:57] resign and within I don't hear for a
[1:12:00] year and a half and a a short time after
[1:12:04] I here I'm
[1:12:08] over here in Victoria
[1:12:10] going to the native Indian people
[1:12:13] because I think that
[1:12:17] uh there's something better.
[1:12:22] And so he says, "Let a little water be
[1:12:26] gotten you and and rest yourself. Wash
[1:12:29] your feet
[1:12:33] and I will fetch a morsel of bread and
[1:12:36] comfort ye your hearts.
[1:12:39] After that ye shall pass on, for
[1:12:42] therefore are ye come
[1:12:46] to your servants." And they said, "So
[1:12:50] do,
[1:12:53] so do as thou hast said." And Abraham
[1:12:57] hastened unto the tent, unto Sarah.
[1:13:02] See, there was nothing. There was there
[1:13:05] was no church.
[1:13:08] There was no
[1:13:10] big meeting going on.
[1:13:13] this has to do with washing your feet
[1:13:15] and and just we got a little water.
[1:13:20] We'll get a little water and and he's
[1:13:22] going to rush to his wife and said
[1:13:25] quickly
[1:13:27] uh make three
[1:13:30] measures of fine meal need it. He tells
[1:13:34] her how to do it
[1:13:37] and make cakes upon the hearth. And
[1:13:40] Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a
[1:13:44] calf tender, good, and gave it unto a
[1:13:49] young man. And he hasted to dress it.
[1:13:53] And he took butter and milk, and the
[1:13:57] calf which he had dressed, and set it
[1:14:01] before them, and he stood by them under
[1:14:05] the tree,
[1:14:07] and they did eat.
[1:14:09] Oh, this is a this is a fantastic
[1:14:14] supernatural event.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; He doesn't even realize what's taking
[1:14:22] place. And maybe you don't realize
[1:14:27] exactly.
[1:14:29] Well, uh, we we come here to church. Oh,
[1:14:32] do you? And well, yeah, we we hear
[1:14:37] different ministers get up and and God
[1:14:41] uh seems to anoint them and and uh yeah,
[1:14:45] yeah, we've had pretty unusual. Uh a lot
[1:14:48] of churches haven't started this way,
[1:14:50] but this is this is different. This is
[1:14:53] God's way of doing things, and there's
[1:14:55] different people that he calls in. And
[1:15:00] it's amazing. Absolutely amazing. I look
[1:15:04] at at uh Sister Trace AU and Brother
[1:15:08] Murphy.
[1:15:10] I went to saw saw a man by the name of
[1:15:13] Tony Wong just the other day
[1:15:17] and he's going to help me with
[1:15:18] something.
[1:15:21] But when
[1:15:23] Tracy who's sitting here, you just see
[1:15:27] them sitting here. Well, I'm just
[1:15:29] reading about a man. He just ran to his
[1:15:32] herd to get some. He's He's gonna tell
[1:15:36] his young fellow, "No,
[1:15:39] just kill this calf." And and
[1:15:43] nothing is
[1:15:46] nothing is out of the usual. It's very
[1:15:50] very usual.
[1:15:52] Uh I hope I'm making sense to you.
[1:15:57] Sometimes I have to really think it
[1:15:59] over. and he said, "Well, I think I'll
[1:16:03] just go and shoot a rabbit so we'll have
[1:16:06] some meat."
[1:16:10] Well, that makes sense to me. I Well,
[1:16:12] you know, go and get a rabbit. And then
[1:16:15] you go walking down a path and and uh
[1:16:21] nothing really means anything. He
[1:16:24] doesn't want to go and get a rabbit and
[1:16:26] he goes over and sits on a log. Well, of
[1:16:28] course you sat on a log cuz it's right
[1:16:30] there.
[1:16:32] And I saw her over and sat on the log.
[1:16:38] So, we're we're expecting something
[1:16:40] great.
[1:16:41] Not not expecting anything great.
[1:16:45] And uh
[1:17:04] I was studying this for two three weeks.
[1:17:26] Therefore Sarah laughed within herself
[1:17:29] saying
[1:17:31] now she got involved
[1:17:35] with it.
[1:17:37] If you read the chapter before, you find
[1:17:40] Abraham's the one that laughed.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; And they said, "You're going to have a
[1:17:45] son by Sarah, and Sarah will give you a
[1:17:49] son."
[1:17:50] And he laughed. He fell on the ground
[1:17:54] and laughed.
[1:18:00] Am I reading the same Bible you read?
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; It's the same Bible.
[1:18:06] Well, this sounds like getting ready for
[1:18:09] a a tremendous revival meeting. No,
[1:18:16] it's just ordinary stuff. This is what
[1:18:19] we do. But yeah, it's strange because
[1:18:22] somebody's come in into my life or into
[1:18:26] my domain or into my area and
[1:18:33] and Sarah laughed.
[1:18:38] And the Lord said unto
[1:18:40] Abraham, "Wherefore did Sarah laugh?"
[1:18:44] See, Sarah is the one that's going to
[1:18:47] bear the child. It wasn't Abraham that
[1:18:50] was going to bear the child. She is
[1:18:52] actually going to bear the child. And
[1:18:56] wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying,
[1:18:59] "Shall I of assurityity bear a son which
[1:19:03] am old?"
[1:19:05] is and and and the answer is from the
[1:19:11] guest. Is anything too hard for the
[1:19:15] Lord?
[1:19:17] At the time appointed,
[1:19:20] I will return unto thee.
[1:19:25] At the time appointed,
[1:19:28] I will return unto thee according to the
[1:19:31] time of life. and Sarah shall have a
[1:19:34] son.
[1:19:38] I feel inclined to say to you
[1:19:42] at the time appointed this is this is
[1:19:46] exactly
[1:19:48] where God hid himself and the prophet of
[1:19:52] God said
[1:19:55] God was in a Christ was in Abraham.
[1:20:02] Oh, Christ was in Abraham.
[1:20:08] And Abraham is laughing
[1:20:12] at the, you know, even at the
[1:20:15] possibility that she will bear a son.
[1:20:22] And this is and and the one that the the
[1:20:26] messenger, the angel
[1:20:28] said.
[1:20:31] And uh
[1:20:34] excuse me for I I don't mean to make fun
[1:20:39] but I I want to bring it to realization.
[1:20:55] Abraham did not say, "Oh, this is
[1:20:58] incredible. I've got I wonder I wonder
[1:21:01] if this messenger knows my name.
[1:21:08] That didn't make any difference whether
[1:21:10] he knew his name or not.
[1:21:13] He's just saying he said to Abraham,
[1:21:17] "Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying shall
[1:21:21] I assurity bear a child which am old?"
[1:21:25] And he says, "Is anything too hard for
[1:21:28] God?" Now, I I preached on that just a
[1:21:31] short time ago.
[1:21:33] Is anything too hard for God? Is
[1:21:36] anything too outstanding?
[1:21:39] Is anything too supernatural
[1:21:42] for the Lord? At the time appointed, I
[1:21:46] will return unto thee. Well, he doesn't
[1:21:49] even know who he is.
[1:21:52] He's never never seen him before. He's
[1:21:54] never had this kind of visitation. And
[1:21:57] now he comes right to the point.
[1:22:01] Uh
[1:22:04] I'm sitting on a log
[1:22:09] and he comes right to the point.
[1:22:15] I was I was like that Abraham.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Are are you listening?
[1:22:24] And he comes right to the point said,
[1:22:26] 'You know, today I was riding along
[1:22:29] behind Bud. Well, that's not staggering.
[1:22:34] Of course, you're riding along behind.
[1:22:38] And he came to me there.
[1:22:41] Oh,
[1:22:43] that's starting to be different.
[1:22:46] And I believe you have three questions
[1:22:48] you want to ask.
[1:22:52] He didn't say, "You've had these for a
[1:22:53] long time.
[1:22:56] They've troubled you for a long time."
[1:22:59] He didn't say to Abraham, "You've wanted
[1:23:02] this a long time and now you've gotten
[1:23:05] old and your body's dead." But way into
[1:23:10] the New Testament, 2,000 years later,
[1:23:13] Apostle Paul says he staggered not at
[1:23:17] the promise of God.
[1:23:21] of God.
[1:23:24] Was it God
[1:23:26] making the promise?
[1:23:28] Now, has this gone more
[1:23:31] more of a service,
[1:23:34] more of a service? This is God meeting
[1:23:38] people. This is God meeting an
[1:23:40] individual. This is God
[1:23:44] digging out the very ache of his entire
[1:23:48] heart. This is an entire being. He even
[1:23:51] has prayed.
[1:23:54] All I have is this Elizer. Who will you
[1:23:57] give me as a as a servant? Who who will
[1:24:01] I leave things to? Who will I leave my
[1:24:04] estate to?
[1:24:08] This is what he was concerned about. And
[1:24:11] now he comes right to the point
[1:24:14] and he says, "I will return to you
[1:24:20] according to the time of life." And I
[1:24:23] want to just say to you that very one
[1:24:27] that was unveiling the secret of
[1:24:32] his heart was unveiling the secret of my
[1:24:36] heart.
[1:24:38] He was in his tent door. He was in his
[1:24:42] element. He was in his
[1:24:46] desert place. He was in his tent door in
[1:24:50] the heat of the day. I was in none of
[1:24:54] that.
[1:24:56] I was up in the place I grew up in. But
[1:25:01] uh but somehow there was a similarity of
[1:25:04] events happening.
[1:25:09] And and Abraham was doing just what he
[1:25:12] could do.
[1:25:14] He was doing what he could do. I was
[1:25:17] doing what I could do. You're doing what
[1:25:20] you can do.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; And brother Ken is doing what he can do.
[1:25:26] He can teach a class. I can't teach the
[1:25:29] class. Uh, brother Kim Dingwald is doing
[1:25:32] what he can do
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; and uh, you are doing what you can do.
[1:25:39] And brother Michael uh, you can you can
[1:25:44] put these things together and and I
[1:25:46] don't even know if you know where where
[1:25:48] the wisdom come from. And you brothers,
[1:25:52] brother Andrew on a camera or
[1:25:57] the brothers of musicians that play
[1:26:00] Brother Phillip and and Oruron and so
[1:26:03] on. You play the instrument. Maybe
[1:26:06] you're doing something that you can do
[1:26:09] and someone else is
[1:26:13] perhaps doing nothing physically, but
[1:26:15] you're doing what you can do simply by
[1:26:18] listening and hearing and questioning
[1:26:23] and saying,
[1:26:25] "Yeah,
[1:26:27] who is this?
[1:26:30] Who is this? Who's actually who is this
[1:26:33] troubling my sleep at night?
[1:26:37] Who is this that's talking to me? Who is
[1:26:40] this that's given me this desire? Who
[1:26:42] has led me to this place?
[1:26:46] And what is it? Because I'm barely
[1:26:51] scratched the surface of this message.
[1:26:55] He is wanting to make himself known to
[1:26:58] you,
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; to reveal himself to you. And so he
[1:27:03] brought you to what we call a message,
[1:27:06] but he brought you to a place and you
[1:27:09] begin to hear things and you begin to
[1:27:12] read a rapture message which I will talk
[1:27:17] about in a few moments.
[1:27:19] Are you getting tired?
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; for sure.
[1:27:31] Now, I thought
[1:27:34] uh a few
[1:27:36] about a week ago or so, I began to think
[1:27:40] about the two worlds,
[1:27:43] the events.
[1:27:48] And here's here's Sarah, and here's
[1:27:51] Abraham.
[1:27:53] And these three have come and they're
[1:27:57] going to go on down to Sodom.
[1:28:01] And Jesus is going to come
[1:28:05] some centuries later.
[1:28:08] He is the one. He He is the
[1:28:14] He's the promised seed.
[1:28:18] And And the thing that's on this angel's
[1:28:23] mind is he's going to reveal
[1:28:28] himself
[1:28:30] to this Abraham, this uh chosen one.
[1:28:37] He's been elected. He's been called.
[1:28:40] He's You're going to have a son.
[1:28:43] And that son
[1:28:46] was Jesus Christ.
[1:28:49] And Jesus Christ was the promised son.
[1:28:53] He didn't come through an older woman or
[1:28:57] an older man. He came through a virgin
[1:29:00] birth. But always there was some some
[1:29:06] things attached to it that was funny,
[1:29:10] strange.
[1:29:11] Virgin birth that you've never known a
[1:29:14] man and
[1:29:16] and uh
[1:29:18] you believe that?
[1:29:22] That's crazy for people to believe that.
[1:29:26] Well, we believe that he was virgin
[1:29:28] born.
[1:29:30] He was the virgin born.
[1:29:32] You believe that he lived and he died on
[1:29:37] the cross? Well, other all kinds of
[1:29:40] people died. Another man was dying with
[1:29:42] him and he said uh to the other man that
[1:29:46] was they were partners in crime.
[1:29:50] And he says we suffer
[1:29:54] justly for our sin. We've done things.
[1:29:58] We've been bad people.
[1:30:02] But this man hasn't done anything.
[1:30:06] What's happening? Something's happening.
[1:30:10] And he he he's on the right side of the
[1:30:12] Lord and he looks over and he says,
[1:30:18] "Lord,
[1:30:20] remember me
[1:30:22] when you come into your kingdom."
[1:30:26] And this man who never done anything but
[1:30:29] was gasping for breath the same as he
[1:30:34] is. And Jesus says he's just a different
[1:30:38] man. But this man he says now he says to
[1:30:42] him remember me when you come into your
[1:30:45] kingdom. And Jesus says today you'll be
[1:30:49] with me in paradise. Did that actually
[1:30:52] happen?
[1:30:53] Why didn't he tell him
[1:30:56] We'll get out of here. I'm going to get
[1:30:58] you out. That's what a lot of people
[1:31:01] would like to hear today. I'll get you
[1:31:03] out of this mess. I'll get you out of
[1:31:06] I'll fix everything up. No, he didn't
[1:31:09] promise anything. He didn't say he'll
[1:31:12] fix things up. He just said, "Today
[1:31:15] you'll be with me in paradise." And and
[1:31:18] and two, three days later, he emptied
[1:31:22] paradise.
[1:31:24] and took him out. But he never said
[1:31:27] anything about that. But do we actually
[1:31:30] believe that that's what happened?
[1:31:51] I want to
[1:31:54] Take it down to slide two.
[1:32:16] This is what I said about Abraham.
[1:32:28] Three things.
[1:32:30] Now this is the now this is the rapture
[1:32:34] message which we read.
[1:32:38] Three things happens. A shout,
[1:32:42] a voice, a trumpet has to happen before
[1:32:46] Jesus appears. Jesus does all three of
[1:32:50] them when he's descending. Figure that
[1:32:53] one out.
[1:32:56] A shout. What is a shout? What is the
[1:33:00] shout? It's the message going forth.
[1:33:04] First, the living bread of life bringing
[1:33:08] forth the bride.
[1:33:12] So, it's got to bring forth.
[1:33:15] The living bread of life has to bring
[1:33:18] forth.
[1:33:20] Now,
[1:33:23] just hold that a moment.
[1:33:26] You know, God knows how to hide.
[1:33:30] Some of you kids, you play hide and
[1:33:33] seek.
[1:33:36] Well, there's a lot of people seeking,
[1:33:41] but God knows how to hide.
[1:33:44] And he hid in the frail humanity.
[1:33:49] And he said to Abraham,
[1:33:52] "He's hiding.
[1:33:55] He's going to eat
[1:33:57] flesh of a calf
[1:34:00] and drink milk
[1:34:03] and eat butter.
[1:34:05] And he's going to not do anything
[1:34:08] surprising,
[1:34:10] but he's going to says, "I
[1:34:15] will return unto you."
[1:34:18] And what I'm saying to you, I want to
[1:34:20] say to this all the streaming
[1:34:23] congregation
[1:34:25] and all who ever will hear this. This
[1:34:29] God
[1:34:31] is not going to come in the clouds.
[1:34:35] as people have thought. He's not going
[1:34:38] to be depending on
[1:34:42] uh the music or the technology
[1:34:47] or all the things that go to make up our
[1:34:52] worship. He could come in the most
[1:34:56] unspectacular
[1:34:58] way.
[1:35:00] He could come in the most uh
[1:35:04] well unspectacular is a good word.
[1:35:09] He comes so ordinary
[1:35:12] people just wonder.
[1:35:17] I looked up a a man's obituary
[1:35:24] and that man stood beside me.
[1:35:28] He stood right beside me on this side
[1:35:34] when I was with brother Brandham in our
[1:35:38] hometown
[1:35:40] where my wife was born. That doesn't
[1:35:43] make it spectacular, but I'm happy for
[1:35:46] that
[1:35:47] in Dawson Creek. And we have a meeting.
[1:35:52] And do you know why we have a meeting?
[1:35:53] Well, I heard this man that you know he
[1:35:59] said that the angel of the Lord and I
[1:36:01] wondered if the angel of the Lord and
[1:36:04] Michael this will mean something more to
[1:36:06] you now.
[1:36:10] I was waiting for the angel Lord
[1:36:14] and then uh
[1:36:17] the people are singing.
[1:36:21] A few people a few more than are here.
[1:36:25] I love him.
[1:36:28] I love him.
[1:36:32] And he says,
[1:36:34] brother Bram says, "Do you love him
[1:36:38] so sweetly, so nice,
[1:36:41] because he first loved me?"
[1:36:45] And he cries out, "You'll not commit
[1:36:49] suicide, soldier boy."
[1:36:53] I thought, "Where does that come from?
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; That's the devil talking to you.
[1:37:02] You'll go home and be a real man.
[1:37:08] I had experienced those things. What do
[1:37:11] you do with it?
[1:37:14] What am I supposed to do with that?
[1:37:18] I say
[1:37:20] if he ever lived, yes,
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; he still lives.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; If he ever did that, he can do it the
[1:37:27] same way. If he ever spoke, he can speak
[1:37:32] to these people.
[1:37:34] He can speak to anyone. If he can speak
[1:37:37] to me, he can speak to anyone.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; He can say the same thing. He knows
[1:37:44] exactly
[1:37:46] what's the deep hunger of your heart.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; he knows that.
[1:37:53] He knows what it is in a lad. He knows
[1:37:55] what it is in an old man that's wanting
[1:37:58] to have a child.
[1:38:02] He understands all of those things. He
[1:38:05] knows the people who want to go to
[1:38:08] heaven.
[1:38:11] He understands that. And you've lived
[1:38:14] for it. You've lived for it. Oh, I just
[1:38:18] desire
[1:38:20] that I'll experience the change of this
[1:38:23] body. God knows that.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what you have gone
[1:38:30] through.
[1:38:32] Oh, say my friends deny it and
[1:38:37] doesn't make any difference.
[1:38:40] The persecution that's associated with
[1:38:42] it makes no difference at all.
[1:38:48] Does he know it? He absolutely knows it.
[1:38:52] It was back there in Abraham's day.
[1:38:55] There he was in Jesus day. Exactly the
[1:38:59] same thing. And I will return unto you
[1:39:02] who and he so he said in this he
[1:39:07] appeared to Abraham
[1:39:10] in this name.
[1:39:12] And while he appeared to him in his name
[1:39:17] and Abraham recognized who he was.
[1:39:21] That's the key.
[1:39:24] The hearer recognized who he was that
[1:39:28] was speaking.
[1:39:30] And I knew that a man
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; that had just got off a horse. I knew
[1:39:36] that a man that was going to shoot a
[1:39:40] rabbit if we saw one for me for camp. I
[1:39:45] knew that it was more than that.
[1:39:48] More than that. It was the same one
[1:39:52] that's talked to Abraham. It was the
[1:39:55] same one that was
[1:39:57] on earth.
[1:40:00] This was God.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; He had to know what was the deep thing
[1:40:06] of of my heart. Excuse me for being that
[1:40:11] personal,
[1:40:13] but he knew. And it says that
[1:40:16] Abraham recognized who he was. And if
[1:40:21] there's if there's anything between
[1:40:24] time,
[1:40:26] is there uh is there a difference of
[1:40:29] time? Oh, that was in that time element.
[1:40:32] This is in this time element.
[1:40:36] He changed Abraham's name.
[1:40:40] Now he's come to the fullness of
[1:40:43] believing.
[1:40:45] Now
[1:40:47] I trust that I have come to the fullness
[1:40:52] of believing.
[1:40:57] See where the church has come. I hope
[1:41:01] you can read between the lines. And I
[1:41:04] say to this church, I say to those that
[1:41:09] listen and are streaming the meeting,
[1:41:13] you're looking for something more than
[1:41:15] church. You're looking for something
[1:41:17] more than just good song leading. We
[1:41:21] have some of the best as far as I'm
[1:41:23] concerned. I just but I I listen to the
[1:41:27] songs and the song leading and the
[1:41:31] preaching of the word because I want
[1:41:34] this one who is eternal
[1:41:38] has no beginning and no end. I want this
[1:41:42] one who has guided
[1:41:46] guided me who has spoken.
[1:41:51] And he says, I hope you can read between
[1:41:54] the lines. I want to say to this people
[1:41:58] here, yes,
[1:42:01] I do read between the lines.
[1:42:05] And sometimes
[1:42:07] sometimes I think it's God.
[1:42:12] And you say, "Well, why sometimes?"
[1:42:14] Because sometimes it doesn't look like
[1:42:17] God. Sometimes it doesn't act like God.
[1:42:22] Sometimes it doesn't
[1:42:25] just fit
[1:42:27] your
[1:42:29] uh what do I say? It it doesn't fit how
[1:42:32] you have things figured out. But still
[1:42:36] on down the road, you'll find out, hey,
[1:42:40] that was that was a supernatural thing.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. Right.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; That that was God. That was beyond human
[1:42:49] humanity.
[1:42:51] But every time now
[1:42:56] I'm going to mention some things.
[1:43:00] That may be a little bit hard.
[1:43:05] Come up to the place
[1:43:07] to where he's revealed to him
[1:43:11] who he was.
[1:43:13] And when he changed Abram's name
[1:43:17] so that the promise
[1:43:20] could be fulfilled,
[1:43:22] so that the promise
[1:43:26] There are some things you're waiting
[1:43:28] for. Oh,
[1:43:30] I just long for a rapture. I just long.
[1:43:35] Some people talk about a rapture like an
[1:43:37] escape.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; It's an escape button. We're going to
[1:43:41] get out of here and we're don't not The
[1:43:45] rapture is not an escape. The rapture is
[1:43:48] going to happen when he has fulfilled
[1:43:52] everything. And one of the great things
[1:43:55] is he's wanting to reveal himself.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; That's number one. And number two is
[1:44:02] this is his secret. He wants to reveal
[1:44:06] who he is. And he wants number two, a
[1:44:11] group of people to recognize who it is
[1:44:14] that's talking.
[1:44:17] We just say,
[1:44:21] Sister Tracy, and you children of the
[1:44:25] Wong family and your dad's up there,
[1:44:29] you don't know what goes on in my heart,
[1:44:32] but I know
[1:44:34] God. This God,
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; this God that spoke even to myself,
[1:44:43] this God, he's not limited to places or
[1:44:46] people or anything.
[1:44:48] This God in simplicity,
[1:44:52] he he's the one who directs something.
[1:44:54] He says,
[1:44:56] "You know
[1:45:02] this God,
[1:45:04] he went to India.
[1:45:06] This God went to Africa.
[1:45:10] This God,
[1:45:14] he dealt with a boy on the Alaskan
[1:45:18] highway.
[1:45:20] This God, he's got time for that."
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this God
[1:45:26] thought about China.
[1:45:28] This God thought about all of these
[1:45:31] people. And as this God, I talked to
[1:45:35] him. I said,
[1:45:40] I I don't have any
[1:45:43] of the oriental people in my church.
[1:45:48] It must be. And just before,
[1:45:51] you don't know this, Sister Tracy, but
[1:45:54] just before
[1:45:56] you
[1:45:58] and Murphy arrived, I was ready to leave
[1:46:03] because I said, "Surely
[1:46:08] this God is not going to leave all of
[1:46:11] these people
[1:46:14] without a without a a
[1:46:18] without an answer. Their cry there must
[1:46:22] be there must be a cry.
[1:46:25] This God hears that
[1:46:30] and here you come.
[1:46:33] You come just to be baptized
[1:46:36] and I don't even know it, but apparently
[1:46:39] you're going beyond from here. you just
[1:46:44] dropped in here to be baptized and you
[1:46:46] run into some people or
[1:46:49] somebody and he says, "I think there's a
[1:46:52] man there that'll baptize you." And and
[1:46:55] and I don't know. I don't know. And then
[1:46:59] the next thing I know is
[1:47:01] there's translations happening and and u
[1:47:06] pe people that you you have no way of
[1:47:09] knowing.
[1:47:11] What are you doing? Oh, it's being
[1:47:14] translated and it's going to China.
[1:47:17] There's people there that want to
[1:47:18] listen. There is. Well, I don't know
[1:47:21] anything.
[1:47:23] You might as well write that in the
[1:47:24] Bible because you cannot understand it.
[1:47:29] And what I'm trying to say to you and I
[1:47:31] will say to you, this God understands
[1:47:35] every detail. And this is his work. It's
[1:47:39] not a man's work. It's not a group of
[1:47:42] people's work. This is his work. This
[1:47:45] message is his message.
[1:47:49] He is the one that has supported it. And
[1:47:52] we don't have to make it work. It will
[1:47:55] work by itself. Do you believe that?
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; I do.
[1:48:01] Amen.
[1:48:20] Now, God has a way of doing things and
[1:48:23] he never changes his policy. He never
[1:48:27] changes his
[1:48:29] looks like he's going to say policy or
[1:48:31] gain or program.
[1:48:33] He's the unchanging God. In Amos 3 and7,
[1:48:38] he said he would do nothing in the earth
[1:48:42] until he first revealed it to his
[1:48:44] servants, the prophets. And just as
[1:48:47] certain as he promised it, he'll do it,
[1:48:51] he has done it.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Amos 3:7. Surely the Lord God will do
[1:49:03] nothing, but he revealth his secret. And
[1:49:08] I have it underlined. And you can
[1:49:10] underline that.
[1:49:12] He has a secret. He will reveal his
[1:49:18] secret
[1:49:19] unto his servants, the prophets.
[1:49:23] So, he's
[1:49:25] seeking to reveal his secret.
[1:49:30] God has a secret.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; And he knows how to hide.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; He hid in the frail humanity
[1:49:42] of Abraham.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; He healed. He re he he hid in the frail
[1:49:49] humanity
[1:49:51] of Sarah.
[1:49:54] He hid in the frail humanity of two
[1:49:58] people that laughed
[1:50:02] that they would receive a promised seed.
[1:50:07] He hid in the frail humanity of David.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:13] who saw a naked woman bathing
[1:50:18] and he desired to have a child of her
[1:50:23] and the child died.
[1:50:29] It was not born correct,
[1:50:34] you say. And God's going to use David.
[1:50:39] Furthermore, this God who you declare
[1:50:42] you serve,
[1:50:44] he's the one that said, "I'll raise up,
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; a kingdom to you,
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; and that kingdom will never end. It'll
[1:50:56] never cease."
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; You're listening close.
[1:51:07] And his secret is he hid himself
[1:51:11] so in the frailty of
[1:51:14] a man
[1:51:16] even David and David prospered
[1:51:21] and he was hidden in that
[1:51:25] he wouldn't use him to even build his
[1:51:28] temple.
[1:51:30] He thought, "I'll build his temple."
[1:51:34] And God said, "No, you'll not build it.
[1:51:38] You've shed too much blood.
[1:51:41] Your son will build it. Solomon will
[1:51:44] build it."
[1:51:47] Who can figure this kind of God out? Who
[1:51:50] can figure him out?
[1:51:54] I haven't figured him out.
[1:51:57] And here we said that well we have all
[1:52:00] the answers so we know exactly how the
[1:52:03] rapture is going to take place. And
[1:52:06] brother Bram says in the in the rapture
[1:52:09] message he said
[1:52:13] rapture is not even in the Bible.
[1:52:17] It's not the truth that's not in the
[1:52:19] Bible but the word that he said that's a
[1:52:22] word we just put in there.
[1:52:26] He says that what the Bible says is
[1:52:28] caught up.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; We are caught up
[1:52:35] and
[1:52:40] we we might be caught up in a in a
[1:52:44] certain sphere of
[1:52:46] excitement.
[1:52:48] Is this rapture?
[1:52:52] Maybe it's not. I don't think it is.
[1:52:55] But we're we're caught up. And I can
[1:52:58] tell you what you're caught up with.
[1:53:00] You're caught up.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; The fact that you've heard a voice.
[1:53:08] You've heard from some place
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; that is not earthly.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; You've heard from some place
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; that nothing changes it.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; People leave or people say, "I don't
[1:53:23] believe it anymore. And you feel sorry
[1:53:26] for them.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Really
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; feel sorry for them. I feel sorry for
[1:53:34] people that have not met. I can tell you
[1:53:39] one thing. I can tell you one thing.
[1:53:44] There will come a time. There is a time
[1:53:47] if you've never arrived to it. There
[1:53:50] comes a time
[1:53:52] in everybody's life.
[1:54:00] There comes a time when you need to know
[1:54:06] that everything is fine.
[1:54:09] Everything is all right.
[1:54:14] Yes. Yes,
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; there's a there's a a a great place
[1:54:22] that equalizes
[1:54:25] everybody's position.
[1:54:46] In the rapture message,
[1:54:50] Brother Brandham said, "Now, this is
[1:54:52] it's significant to me,
[1:54:57] and I just reached down to you,
[1:55:00] especially you young people.
[1:55:03] I reached down to you. You know what it
[1:55:06] is to study.
[1:55:08] Now I'm I'm I'm speaking to you
[1:55:13] now. We've come through the church ages,
[1:55:20] but we're promised
[1:55:23] in the last days
[1:55:25] according to Malachi 4.
[1:55:32] You know that this friend of yours,
[1:55:35] and I consider myself your friend,
[1:55:38] I sat on the side of a hill. I sat on
[1:55:42] the side of a mountain,
[1:55:45] not far from where you were, Joanne,
[1:55:49] but I sat on the side of a mountain.
[1:55:53] and
[1:55:55] this prophet
[1:55:57] and I I at the time I don't even know
[1:56:03] whether he's a prophet. I don't know. I
[1:56:06] haven't determined a lot of things,
[1:56:09] but everything I've heard coming out of
[1:56:12] his mouth is true, true, true, true,
[1:56:16] true, true.
[1:56:19] It's absolutely true. Oh, I know that
[1:56:22] woman. I know this man.
[1:56:27] And I was telling you, I looked at at an
[1:56:29] orbituary. I just looked at the obituary
[1:56:32] because that man
[1:56:35] stood right beside me
[1:56:38] when brother Brandham is talking to a
[1:56:40] woman
[1:56:43] and he says
[1:56:46] he says over his shoulder like that the
[1:56:48] boy will be all right
[1:56:54] and this man some something goes by me
[1:56:58] something strikes me.
[1:57:02] I'm I'm I'm I'm hoping my words strike
[1:57:05] your heart. Something strikes me.
[1:57:09] And this man collapses
[1:57:13] and he's bent over
[1:57:16] and
[1:57:17] I I don't know what's going on. I I
[1:57:22] don't know. All I know is what I I know
[1:57:24] he's talking to somebody. I know that a
[1:57:27] something goes past me. I know that I'm
[1:57:31] in bewildered. I I don't I don't know
[1:57:35] what's happening. I know this man has
[1:57:37] collapsed and I know he's weeping.
[1:57:42] He's uncontrollably weeping.
[1:57:47] And I I you know what do you do when
[1:57:50] you're a person that you're always in
[1:57:52] command of things?
[1:57:55] Do I lay my hand on him? Do I comfort
[1:57:59] him? Do I put my arm around him? What do
[1:58:01] I do? This is This is totally mystery.
[1:58:08] You're not beyond that.
[1:58:11] I'm talking to you. You're not beyond
[1:58:13] that.
[1:58:16] What? What do you do?
[1:58:18] I'm mystified.
[1:58:20] And he stands up and nudges me.
[1:58:25] while the meeting is still going on,
[1:58:28] while the prayer line is still going on.
[1:58:30] And he nudges me and he says, "Brother
[1:58:33] Eddie, you see that boy down there?" A
[1:58:37] boy
[1:58:39] about 14.
[1:58:41] He said, "Do you see him down to the end
[1:58:43] of the line about two, three people from
[1:58:46] the line?
[1:58:48] I'm reading his orbituary
[1:58:51] just before I come to the service.
[1:58:55] I'm reading his orbituary.
[1:58:58] A man who lived, a man who taught
[1:59:03] uh people in Seattle
[1:59:07] and a man who traveled all over the
[1:59:10] world.
[1:59:13] Did he tell anybody that?
[1:59:17] Who talked to him? Who says the boy will
[1:59:20] be all right?
[1:59:26] That's my son.
[1:59:28] He's up for an operation
[1:59:31] this week.
[1:59:34] And I don't know if that son
[1:59:39] was all right or not. I don't know.
[1:59:43] But I know that was God that spoke to
[1:59:45] him. That was God that caused him to
[1:59:50] collapse.
[1:59:54] And no one can ever convince me
[1:59:58] that that was not God that talked with
[2:00:01] him.
[2:00:02] I will return unto thee.
[2:00:06] That God was returning to him. Yes. Yes.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; That God.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Now, he said, "We've come through the
[2:00:19] church ages and we're promised in the
[2:00:22] last days according to Malachi 4 that
[2:00:25] there would be a return again,
[2:00:28] a prophet in the land." That's right.
[2:00:33] Notice his nature.
[2:00:35] What he would be. what he would be like.
[2:00:39] He's always
[2:00:47] in the messenger Queen of Sheba.
[2:00:51] He said, "I come." And when he did, when
[2:00:57] he did come, the people did not
[2:01:00] recognize him.
[2:01:03] Oh,
[2:01:05] pray. Oh God,
[2:01:09] may we recognize you.
[2:01:13] They did not recognize him.
[2:01:18] He comes just exactly
[2:01:22] the way the scripture said that he would
[2:01:26] come.
[2:01:27] He come
[2:01:29] and he was the Jewish Messiah.
[2:01:33] And not only Jewish Messiah,
[2:01:36] he was the promised seed of Abraham.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; So, here's a man standing on earth.
[2:01:49] Here's a man
[2:01:51] that you listen to.
[2:01:54] Here's a man. You hear the tapes.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; You hear his voice. But I say it's
[2:02:01] different
[2:02:02] than any other man.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; It's completely different.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; And I would be something less than a man
[2:02:11] if I didn't say to you, I'm a man. And I
[2:02:15] will tell you, he has spoken. And I knew
[2:02:19] it was something more than a man in blue
[2:02:22] blue jeans. I knew it was something more
[2:02:25] than a man driving just a station wagon.
[2:02:31] So you say, "Well, who was it?" You
[2:02:34] answer it.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Who is this that called you? Who is this
[2:02:40] that's doing these things?
[2:02:42] Oh, it's by accident. No, I don't think
[2:02:46] so. I think that for sure, for certain
[2:02:52] you are a
[2:02:55] You're desiring.
[2:02:58] You're waiting for,
[2:03:02] you're living for
[2:03:08] a rapture, a change.
[2:03:12] What's that going to be like? I don't I
[2:03:14] have no idea.
[2:03:16] I have no idea what it's going to be
[2:03:18] like,
[2:03:21] but I just want to
[2:03:24] emphasize something at this moment.
[2:03:34] And that is the timelessness
[2:03:37] of God.
[2:03:41] You have the ability to look back. You
[2:03:44] have the ability to look forward.
[2:03:49] This God
[2:03:51] that I'm speaking to you about this
[2:03:53] morning,
[2:03:56] he's not dependent upon those things
[2:04:00] or something has happened.
[2:04:03] Everything is in the present tense.
[2:04:17] Now, I'm just going to
[2:04:21] tell you why I can't explain it
[2:04:25] is because
[2:04:27] it's unexplainable.
[2:04:30] Brother Brandham couldn't explain it.
[2:04:33] And that is why
[2:04:36] somehow we're mystified by it.
[2:04:40] But in the in the message of Queen of
[2:04:42] Sheba, the Queen of the South, he said,
[2:04:46] "You don't understand.
[2:04:49] It's just not. There's no need of trying
[2:04:52] to explain it.
[2:04:57] It's in another world." And this is what
[2:05:01] I was coming to some moments ago. That
[2:05:05] world
[2:05:09] is right beside you.
[2:05:14] And it's important to recognize that,
[2:05:17] brother Nathan, the world that brother
[2:05:19] Brandon was in,
[2:05:22] this one that was speaking to
[2:05:26] uh speaking to Abraham
[2:05:30] and is speaking to you.
[2:05:34] He says,
[2:05:36] "I
[2:05:38] will surely return unto you according to
[2:05:42] the time of life, and Sarah shall have a
[2:05:45] son."
[2:05:47] The Bible says in Hebrews the 11th
[2:05:49] chapter, "And Sarah,
[2:05:53] she believed." There is something if you
[2:05:56] to ask her at that moment, do you
[2:05:58] believe?
[2:06:01] Well,
[2:06:02] I'm trying. I'm I I guess I do believe I
[2:06:07] I certainly don't doubt it. Do you
[2:06:10] believe this message? Yeah, I I do. I
[2:06:14] really do. Deep down in my heart. Do you
[2:06:17] believe this message?
[2:06:19] Well, there's nothing else.
[2:06:22] There is nothing else that's real. I
[2:06:25] believe it.
[2:06:27] All right.
[2:06:30] The Bible says, "By faith
[2:06:34] Sarah received
[2:06:36] strength
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; to conceive
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; and she brought forth the promised
[2:06:44] seed."
[2:06:46] That was it. That's all there is to it.
[2:06:50] She brought forth the promised seed.
[2:06:53] And now 3 4,000 years later,
[2:06:58] we have a man
[2:07:01] uh a hunter.
[2:07:06] He's just as common as an old boot,
[2:07:10] Brother Brandham.
[2:07:13] And
[2:07:21] he says, he says there's no use of
[2:07:25] trying to explain it. It's another
[2:07:28] world.
[2:07:30] It's something that God knows what was,
[2:07:35] what is,
[2:07:37] and what will be.
[2:07:41] Don't you believe that
[2:07:43] this God knows what was,
[2:07:48] what is,
[2:07:50] and what will be. We don't know what
[2:07:53] he's going to tell us.
[2:07:56] You have
[2:07:58] had this question.
[2:08:00] You are sitting here
[2:08:04] and you have
[2:08:07] at the present moment you have that
[2:08:10] question you wonder what will it be
[2:08:14] what will it be when we get over yonder
[2:08:17] I don't know
[2:08:19] what will it be has he has he in the
[2:08:22] past has he dealt with you in a way that
[2:08:25] you know no he has been very unusual
[2:08:33] unpredictable
[2:08:35] in a way that I can't predict it.
[2:08:40] But when it happens, is it real or is it
[2:08:44] ever real?
[2:08:46] Do I ever know it's real? When it
[2:08:49] happens, is it him? Oh, yes, it is him.
[2:08:55] Yes, it is.
[2:08:57] I don't doubt it at all. Well, what will
[2:09:00] it be like? I don't know.
[2:09:04] I don't know. Does it make any sense to
[2:09:06] you?
[2:09:09] I hope that does.
[2:09:15] In another message, be not afraid. Now,
[2:09:18] this is your messenger.
[2:09:21] He's saying it's another world.
[2:09:25] And you see people when they were little
[2:09:29] bitty children. Can you imagine
[2:09:33] seeing you
[2:09:35] and he sees you as little bitty children
[2:09:41] or something
[2:09:44] and you have to talk fast
[2:09:49] because you know you're standing here.
[2:09:53] Now figure that one out.
[2:09:59] You're standing here, but yet you're
[2:10:03] somewhere else.
[2:10:06] And you're talking to little bitty
[2:10:07] children
[2:10:11] and you're standing here talking maybe
[2:10:14] to an old person,
[2:10:21] but yet you're somewhere else
[2:10:24] way back somewhere else talking.
[2:10:30] And and I I feel
[2:10:33] I feel really a warning.
[2:10:37] Whatever you do, do not say, "Oh, that's
[2:10:41] fine. That was Brother Brandham." No,
[2:10:45] that'd be a big mistake if you do that.
[2:10:51] He was he was just talking maybe to
[2:10:55] someone and he's
[2:10:58] and the fact that he's gone God has sent
[2:11:01] this to this generation. The fact that
[2:11:04] he's gone uh uh way back and he sees
[2:11:09] little children.
[2:11:11] He's talking to a lady and I'm listening
[2:11:13] to her here. I'm listening to her here
[2:11:15] in this life. And he says,
[2:11:19] he says, "Can I tell it?" He's asking
[2:11:22] her, "Can he tell it?"
[2:11:26] Because he sees her as 8 years old
[2:11:30] falling down a well
[2:11:36] because you know you're standing here
[2:11:39] and you're somewhere else way back
[2:11:42] somewhere else talking.
[2:11:45] And when you come out of it, you don't
[2:11:48] know what you said
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; till you listen to it on the tape.
[2:11:57] And it isn't human.
[2:12:02] It isn't a person.
[2:12:06] That's all.
[2:12:08] It's God. It's always right.
[2:12:12] And he promised that. And he just said,
[2:12:16] he stopped said perceiving their
[2:12:18] thoughts.
[2:12:20] Now you say, well, why am I so baffled?
[2:12:24] Because I'm baffled
[2:12:27] because the man who sang it is baffled.
[2:12:31] He can't explain it
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; and we can't understand it. Even if he
[2:12:38] could explain it, it's impossible to
[2:12:41] explain. you young people, you you're
[2:12:44] going to figure everything out. You'll
[2:12:46] never figure this one out, right?
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; You might have graduated or which we've
[2:12:52] just had a graduation time. You might
[2:12:55] have graduated. You might have gone on
[2:12:57] from there. You might be an intellectual
[2:13:00] person. Forget it. You won't figure this
[2:13:04] one out.
[2:13:06] You might be you might have an IQ that's
[2:13:10] way beyond
[2:13:13] anyone else around.
[2:13:17] But you won't figure this one out.
[2:13:20] This one cannot
[2:13:22] figure out this one that came in the
[2:13:25] heat of the day and ate milk and butter
[2:13:29] and someone sat under a tree and another
[2:13:33] man is there. It's God.
[2:13:37] God just chose to do that. God just
[2:13:40] chose this man.
[2:13:43] What if he chose you and said, you know,
[2:13:47] uh,
[2:13:49] you're going to be an elect one and I'm
[2:13:53] going to send I'm going to send a word
[2:13:55] to you and you know what? You're going
[2:13:57] to believe it.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; You're going to believe something you
[2:14:02] can't figure out. You're going to
[2:14:04] believe it.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; I am.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; You don't even know that you're going to
[2:14:09] believe it.
[2:14:11] You're not going to doubt it
[2:14:14] because I'm giving it to you.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; I'm doing that. It has nothing to do
[2:14:20] with you.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; When you say, "I'm going to believe
[2:14:25] that. Believest thou this." Well, I'm
[2:14:27] going to believe it. You don't have the
[2:14:30] power to believe it. You're going to
[2:14:32] believe something that can't be figured
[2:14:34] out. You're going to believe something
[2:14:35] that can't be explained. You're just I I
[2:14:39] don't know why I believe it.
[2:14:41] You just believe it.
[2:14:44] That's one of the hardest things
[2:14:46] to someone who's always been in control
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; and you think, "I'll fix it." You fix
[2:14:54] it. You won't fix it.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; So, what do you do? You just say, "Well,
[2:15:02] I guess I'll just believe.
[2:15:06] I guess I'll just have faith.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; It isn't human.
[2:15:17] It isn't a person. That's all. It's
[2:15:20] God."
[2:15:22] How can you explain a being that never
[2:15:26] started and never ends and always is?
[2:15:32] How do you explain that?
[2:15:36] That's all. It's God.
[2:15:39] It's always right.
[2:15:41] And he promised that
[2:15:44] perceiving their thoughts.
[2:15:55] The scripture says this.
[2:16:00] I'm going to I'm going to test
[2:16:03] what if you believe this.
[2:16:07] The angels of God
[2:16:10] are encamped about those that fear him.
[2:16:17] So in another world where the five
[2:16:21] senses
[2:16:24] do not declare.
[2:16:28] Oh, I feel it. No, that's exactly
[2:16:33] where people got off and went haywire.
[2:16:36] So, well, I want to see something.
[2:16:41] You might see flashing lights and the
[2:16:43] next time you might not see it. You
[2:16:46] might see a dark cloud. People look at
[2:16:50] uh they look at the picture of him and
[2:16:54] the
[2:16:55] cloud and the thing that he did and so
[2:16:58] on and so forth. But can we just believe
[2:17:03] that we are to believe things that we
[2:17:06] can't see? We are to believe things that
[2:17:10] we can't figure out and it's just going
[2:17:13] to happen anyway. It's going to happen.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; I stood right here.
[2:17:19] I stood right here where this guitar is
[2:17:23] and
[2:17:25] just shooting through my mind
[2:17:29] came exactly
[2:17:32] what I should be asking for.
[2:17:35] And so I asked for it. I said, "That's
[2:17:37] what it'll be."
[2:17:40] And a man who's an unbeliever
[2:17:43] told another man who's paying him
[2:17:47] over a quarter of a million dollars.
[2:17:52] This man's from another country.
[2:17:56] And he stands here.
[2:17:58] I stand here and this this one I'm
[2:18:02] speaking about, this is God.
[2:18:05] He just flashes something through your
[2:18:07] mind and you know it's him
[2:18:11] and so you just move out on it and say,
[2:18:14] "Well, I guess that's it."
[2:18:17] And and and so I I I tell this man who's
[2:18:22] never been in this church
[2:18:25] doesn't confess this Christ at all. And
[2:18:28] I said, "Well,
[2:18:30] I was standing on the platform and this
[2:18:32] is what he said."
[2:18:37] And this man,
[2:18:40] he's been retained by another gentleman
[2:18:45] to to work for him.
[2:18:48] and he says, "Well,
[2:18:50] uh, maybe he'll
[2:18:53] he'll do something different." Speaking
[2:18:56] of me, he said, "No, I I don't think so.
[2:18:59] I don't think he'll do anything
[2:19:01] different."
[2:19:02] He said, "And and so that's it."
[2:19:07] And friends, so you say, "So what
[2:19:10] happened?" Well, exactly what he said is
[2:19:14] what happened.
[2:19:17] Isn't it supposed to be that way?
[2:19:22] I have
[2:19:28] I have been very very I'm going to close
[2:19:33] now but I've been very very
[2:19:38] uh affected
[2:19:42] by They
[2:19:51] been affected by
[2:19:56] the eternal aspect of God.
[2:20:01] You're just
[2:20:03] you're different.
[2:20:05] I've been affected by
[2:20:10] it. makes no difference.
[2:20:13] I've been affected by the people that
[2:20:15] God has used in the scripture.
[2:20:20] I'm affected by
[2:20:23] You read Matthew 1.
[2:20:26] You figure out Matthew. Matthew the
[2:20:28] first chapter. You figure it out for me.
[2:20:35] You just figure out
[2:20:38] who were the lineage
[2:20:41] of Jesus.
[2:20:45] You figure that one out for me. When
[2:20:47] you've got it figured out
[2:20:50] and you got you understand the mind of
[2:20:52] God, this is why he chose them,
[2:20:56] then
[2:20:59] then that'll really help me out.
[2:21:02] I find God using people
[2:21:07] and I'm finding
[2:21:10] in the Bible good people.
[2:21:13] Good people. And now I'm going to shock
[2:21:16] you.
[2:21:18] I talked to I I was reading just where
[2:21:22] brother Brandham talked to a man and he
[2:21:25] said I talked to him and he said he's
[2:21:28] he's really nice. This is something that
[2:21:31] I've struggled with.
[2:21:35] He said he's a nice man.
[2:21:40] Uh he said he's Muhammadan.
[2:21:48] Well, I don't have any fellowship with
[2:21:50] Muhammadan,
[2:21:52] but here he's
[2:21:54] this man that I call a prophet.
[2:21:57] He's
[2:21:59] he's with this man. He's a nice man.
[2:22:04] And the Muhammadan says to him, "But I'm
[2:22:06] not a I'm I'm not a Muhammad and
[2:22:11] you know I I'm a Catholic."
[2:22:16] And he didn't he didn't degrade him one
[2:22:19] iota
[2:22:21] that he said he's a Catholic.
[2:22:24] He said but but he said you know I and
[2:22:27] is explaining to brother Brandham he
[2:22:30] said but
[2:22:32] being Catholic Catholicism is just like
[2:22:36] it became a creed.
[2:22:38] Yeah. And brother Brandham agreed with
[2:22:41] him. Says well it that's what it is.
[2:22:44] It's a it's a creed.
[2:22:48] And brother Brown never tried to
[2:22:51] persuade him to believe on him,
[2:22:55] never tried to bring him into the
[2:22:57] message
[2:22:58] such and so I begin to question
[2:23:03] what about all this
[2:23:05] and
[2:23:07] one one says well I believe this and I
[2:23:10] believe that and I believe something
[2:23:12] else and and
[2:23:15] uh I believe
[2:23:17] I believe the message a certain way and
[2:23:19] I believe the message a certain way.
[2:23:23] I begin to wonder
[2:23:25] is there really value in that?
[2:23:29] Is that what we're supposed to do?
[2:23:32] Uh or are we just supposed to say well
[2:23:35] we believe the word. We believe what God
[2:23:37] has sent.
[2:23:43] How was it
[2:23:47] when
[2:23:48] Abraham got up and walked out of this
[2:23:51] tent
[2:23:56] in the heat of the day,
[2:24:01] this God that had just spoken to him
[2:24:06] and the man just left and he he went he
[2:24:10] said, "I'll take you on your way. So
[2:24:13] they look towards Sodom
[2:24:16] and there's that vile place and
[2:24:20] all the stuff that goes on
[2:24:24] and and now here's a man that just
[2:24:26] talked with God.
[2:24:30] Here's a man that just talked with God.
[2:24:33] Surely they must be eons apart.
[2:24:40] One's just talked with God.
[2:24:44] And here's people
[2:24:47] that are on their way to Sodom.
[2:24:50] And it certainly
[2:24:55] doesn't occur to them 2,000 years from
[2:24:59] now.
[2:25:01] 2,000 years from then,
[2:25:04] this same God
[2:25:07] is going to be right on earth. And the
[2:25:10] seed that they promised,
[2:25:12] the seed of the woman will be right
[2:25:15] there. And he's seeking to reveal
[2:25:18] himself and make himself known. And
[2:25:22] here's the seed that came by a virgin
[2:25:24] birth and
[2:25:28] just having all the trouble in the world
[2:25:31] causing the people to believe. Now, do
[2:25:34] they believe?
[2:25:36] Do they really believe
[2:25:39] or is it just to build a
[2:25:45] I I I read a book
[2:25:48] by Max Diamond
[2:25:51] and it's called the Indestructible
[2:25:54] Jews.
[2:25:56] But it says this.
[2:25:59] He says he might be the son of man.
[2:26:03] He might be Jesus Christ.
[2:26:08] He might be the Messiah,
[2:26:11] but one thing for sure,
[2:26:14] he's not a Christian.
[2:26:18] And I thought
[2:26:22] that is really and they were first
[2:26:24] called Christians
[2:26:26] and uh and then they begin to set things
[2:26:29] up and I don't know what happened after
[2:26:33] that but they that really struck me when
[2:26:38] he said he might have been the son of
[2:26:41] man.
[2:26:42] He might have been the son of God.
[2:26:46] He might have been the Messiah.
[2:26:50] And and this man's a Jew. I I don't know
[2:26:54] what his position is with God, but one
[2:26:57] thing he said for certain, he's not a
[2:26:59] Christian.
[2:27:01] In other words, he's not going
[2:27:03] throughout the land trying to make
[2:27:05] people Christians.
[2:27:08] He's not trying to get them to to
[2:27:13] uh uh to believe a certain belief.
[2:27:16] He's not trying to get people baptized.
[2:27:21] They came to John
[2:27:24] to to be baptized.
[2:27:28] So he they're not trying to
[2:27:31] get people persuaded
[2:27:38] a certain way
[2:27:40] or get their minds a certain Listen, one
[2:27:44] thing that we do not want to do. We do
[2:27:48] not want to get the people in
[2:27:51] expectation of a certain thing. It's
[2:27:54] going to happen a certain way and so on
[2:27:57] and so forth. We don't know. It's better
[2:28:00] that we say the will of the Lord be
[2:28:02] done. Not my will, but thy will be done.
[2:28:06] Oh, Father, I'm just here. I'm just here
[2:28:09] to do your will.
[2:28:13] Can we say that? Amen.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; Let's just pray.
[2:28:20] Heavenly Father,
[2:28:24] I think often of the prayer that Jesus
[2:28:26] prayed
[2:28:28] in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[2:28:31] If it be possible,
[2:28:34] let this cup pass from me. But if not,
[2:28:38] not my will, but thine be done. May
[2:28:42] these people, oh God, that are
[2:28:47] listening.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; May these people who have read these
[2:28:51] scriptures,
[2:28:53] may these people, oh God, who have heard
[2:28:55] this testimony
[2:28:58] also believe. Father,
[2:29:01] we believe with all of our hearts, thy
[2:29:04] will be done. It shall be done. You have
[2:29:09] said that the dead in Christ shall rise.
[2:29:13] We do not how, we do not know when, we
[2:29:18] do not know how, but we know for certain
[2:29:22] what you have said is the truth.
[2:29:25] Absolutely. The truth. We believe that
[2:29:28] you were b born. We believe that you
[2:29:32] lived. We believe, oh God, that you did
[2:29:37] exactly the things that are written
[2:29:40] concerning you. And we believe that you
[2:29:43] died and you rose again. We believe it,
[2:29:46] oh God. We believe it with all our
[2:29:49] hearts, Father. And one thing that we
[2:29:55] are convinced of when your messenger
[2:29:58] came and he spoke on believing your word
[2:30:02] and sang the song the chorus
[2:30:08] only believe.
[2:30:10] All things are possible.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; Only believe.
[2:30:15] Oh God.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; We make confession of that. But yet,
[2:30:22] Father,
[2:30:24] we pray that our faith will be
[2:30:28] unshakable.
[2:30:30] By faith,
[2:30:32] Abraham, by faith,
[2:30:34] Sarah received strength and she
[2:30:39] conceived
[2:30:40] the eternal son of God. We pray, oh God,
[2:30:46] that that this will be a reality to the
[2:30:50] people that have attended this service
[2:30:53] this morning and to those that are
[2:30:56] streaming the meeting. Thy will be done
[2:30:59] on earth as it is in heaven. Amen. Amen.
[2:31:05] Let's stand as we sing. I want to sing
[2:31:08] only believe. Only believe.
[2:31:12] [Music]
[2:31:18] [Music]

[2:32:07] only
[2:32:09] believe
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; and let us sing it.
[2:32:14] Jesus is here
[2:32:17] because this Christ who I've spoken
[2:32:20] about, this Christ who is in Genesis,
[2:32:25] this Christ who is in Matthew,
[2:32:28] this Christ is present even at this
[2:32:31] moment, at this time. And there is not a
[2:32:35] person but what we are in need. And we
[2:32:40] say, "Oh God, you're the God that knows
[2:32:44] every single need and you know my need.
[2:32:49] You know where I'm at. And we pray,
[2:32:53] Father, in the name of Jesus Christ that
[2:32:56] you will do come amongst us and do what
[2:33:00] we have need of.
[2:33:02] Jesus
[2:33:05] is here.
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[2:33:11] is here.
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; All things
[2:33:17] are possible.
[2:33:19] [Music]
[2:33:20] Jesus
[2:33:23] is here.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[2:33:29] is here.
[2:33:32] Jesus
[2:33:34] is here.
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; All things are possible.
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[2:33:45] is here.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; All things
[2:33:52] are are possible.
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[2:33:58] is here. Once again that line
[2:34:02] all things
[2:34:04] are possible.
[2:34:08] Jesus
[2:34:10] is here.
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; And on behalf of our brother Ron Spencer
[2:34:16] we say
[2:34:18] all things
[2:34:21] are possible.
[2:34:25] Jesus
[2:34:27] is here.
[2:34:30] Hallelujah.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We give you all the
[2:34:35] gloryless
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. We bless your name.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:47] You want to just pray?
[2:34:52] Ready? Amen.
[2:34:56] [Music]
[2:34:58] you open this mic and take brother
[2:35:01] Nathan's down just a tad.
[2:35:05] God gave us a Father's Day present this
[2:35:07] morning.
[2:35:09] First John said, "I write unto you
[2:35:13] fathers
[2:35:16] because you have known him that is from
[2:35:18] the beginning."
[2:35:20] It's the kind of message that
[2:35:24] there's more to it than what we've
[2:35:27] thought about.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; There's more to reach into the realms of
[2:35:32] God than we think about. And it's a
[2:35:36] challenging message. It's a a message
[2:35:39] from God himself. And not only does John
[2:35:42] say it once, he then says it twice. He
[2:35:45] said, "I write unto you fathers because
[2:35:48] you have known him from the beginning."
[2:35:51] And I believe our heavenly father has
[2:35:52] spoken to us this morning through our
[2:35:55] spiritual father that has known him and
[2:35:59] moving a church forward to say deeper in
[2:36:04] that holy life till I'm lost with Christ
[2:36:08] in God. It's not a surface message. It's
[2:36:11] not what you've conceived what this
[2:36:13] message is about.
[2:36:15] There's more to it than what you have
[2:36:17] have maybe even thought or or pondered.
[2:36:21] But now we just want to say after we've
[2:36:23] heard this kind of a message, Lord, I
[2:36:26] want to go into those deeper places that
[2:36:29] you've led our pastor that you're
[2:36:30] leading our pastor. And brother Bram
[2:36:32] said, what your pastor is the sheep will
[2:36:34] be. Then I say, Lord, help us. Move us
[2:36:38] from our carnality into that spiritual
[2:36:41] depth that this message holds.
[2:36:46] Let's just sing that deeper in that holy
[2:36:49] life and we'll close.
[2:36:53] [Music]
[2:36:55] Honey, do you know
[2:36:58] in that holy light
[2:37:03] [Music]
[2:37:06] until
[2:37:09] I'm lost with Christ in God
[2:37:14] [Music]
[2:37:20] with my blessing Lord
[2:37:24] Let this be your prayer now
[2:37:27] while
[2:37:29] I walk this earthly.
[2:37:33] Oh, let's sing it again.
[2:37:37] Oh, deeper
[2:37:40] in that holy love.
[2:37:45] [Music]
[2:37:47] Till
[2:37:49] I'm lost with Christ in God
[2:37:55] [Music]
[2:37:57] [Applause]
[2:37:59] with our blessed Lord.
[2:38:05] [Music]
[2:38:08] While I walk this earthly
[2:38:12] song, let's bow our heads. Father, what
[2:38:16] a word hidden.
[2:38:19] Came a time when that which was hidden
[2:38:23] needed to be revealed.
[2:38:26] Your prophet turned around and said,
[2:38:27] "God hid himself in a blade of grass."
[2:38:33] And you've hid it from the wise and the
[2:38:36] foolish, but you revealed it to babes
[2:38:39] that would learn. Lord,
[2:38:43] reveal your word to us as we heard this
[2:38:45] morning. May we not miss in the
[2:38:49] simplicity
[2:38:52] of how you're unveiling it, Lord, and it
[2:38:54] passes by.
[2:38:57] We heard a message, Lord, that's caused
[2:39:00] the inner man to think deeper,
[2:39:04] desire to see you more and to move into
[2:39:09] realms we have not known.
[2:39:12] So, as the pastor was just closing,
[2:39:15] sometimes we'll preach and we give a
[2:39:17] concept, but maybe that's not even the
[2:39:19] right concept.
[2:39:21] So help us be sensitive to catch the
[2:39:25] very thought
[2:39:27] of the concepts of God and move us Lord
[2:39:30] as you've moved a man of God this
[2:39:33] morning into a realm Lord Jesus that our
[2:39:36] soul longs for. And thus we sing this
[2:39:40] song deeper in that holy life. Let's not
[2:39:44] get Lord help us not get caught up in
[2:39:49] just the frivolity of life and the
[2:39:51] simplicity of just nothingness
[2:39:55] but let us get re caught up in that
[2:39:59] simplicity of God
[2:40:02] and show us who you are Lord. Bless our
[2:40:06] dear pastor, a man of God we have loved
[2:40:10] throughout the years and decades.
[2:40:13] Lord, guide us into channels and lead
[2:40:16] him as you would lead us.
[2:40:19] We want this kind of walk. Lord,
[2:40:23] it's not just something glibly spoken.
[2:40:26] It's something from our souls we cry
[2:40:29] out.
[2:40:31] So bless your children this day, Lord,
[2:40:33] as we ponder these deeper thoughts
[2:40:37] and move us into deeper depths.
[2:40:42] Bless the families today that attend
[2:40:45] this little assembly and around the
[2:40:47] world that have joined in. Bless us,
[2:40:50] Lord, and let the presence of God that's
[2:40:52] here now bathe us, guide us, and lead
[2:40:57] us. We pray in Jesus' name.
[2:41:02] In Jesus' name.
[2:41:06] Won't Let's sing a little little song.
[2:41:08] Won't you then walk with me, Jesus?
[2:41:11] Don't ever leave me alone as we walk
[2:41:14] through the
[2:41:16] days that lay ahead. Won't ye walk with
[2:41:22] Jesus.
[2:41:24] [Music]
[2:41:27] Oh, never
[2:41:30] me alone.
[2:41:33] [Music]
[2:41:36] Without you,
[2:41:38] I
[2:41:40] could never.
[2:41:44] No, never.
[2:41:46] Maybe
[2:41:48] my home. One more time as we get ready
[2:41:51] to leave. Oh, won't me walk with you,
[2:41:57] Jesus.
[2:42:03] Leave me
[2:42:06] alone.
[2:42:07] [Music]
[2:42:10] Without
[2:42:12] you, I
[2:42:14] could never.
[2:42:17] Oh, no. Never.
[2:42:20] Make heaven
[2:42:22] our home.
[2:42:24] God be with you. As you leave the
[2:42:27] assembly, just as we have been told that
[2:42:30] we have to stay within the boundaries,
[2:42:33] no shaking of hands. Just go to your car
[2:42:37] and look at one another and say, "God
[2:42:39] bless you." God bless you. Nice to have
[2:42:42] had you here. Any assembly that have
[2:42:44] joined in, God bless you. Have a blessed
[2:42:46] afternoon. You're dismissed in Jesus'
[2:42:48] name. Amen.
[2:42:51] [Music]
[2:46:05] Heat. Heat.
