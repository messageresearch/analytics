[1:47] From
[1:53] [Music]
[2:01] the wings of a snow,
[2:07] God sings
[2:09] your sweet love, a sign from above.
[2:16] [Music]
[2:18] On the wings of mother.
[2:22] Once again. On the wings. On the wings
[2:25] of a soul.

[3:11] Amen. Number 651, Brother Roberto.
[3:16] Amen. Why don't we stand and sing, "Hide

[3:21] but then I cry, "Oh rock of ages, hide
[3:23] thou me." Amen. Have you come to hear
[3:25] from the Lord this morning? And we're
[3:27] looking forward to what God has for us
[3:28] today. Want to greet each and every one
[3:30] in the name of the Lord. Happy to have
[3:32] you here with us today. Just want God to
[3:34] have his way in our midst. Amen.
[3:39] [Music]
[3:44] Oh, sometimes I feel discouraged
[3:50] and take my life in vain.
[3:55] And I'm tempted
[3:58] to murder her and my law complain.
[4:06] But when I think of Jesus
[4:12] and all he's done for me, then I cry.

[12:08] [Music]
[12:19] Amen. And just as we prepare to go to
[12:21] pray, can we sing reach out and touch
[12:22] the Lord as he passes by, we do have a
[12:26] number of prayer requests we just want
[12:27] to hold before the Lord. Maybe you just
[12:30] tuck these in your heart as we sing the
[12:31] chorus. Reach out and touch the Lord.
[12:33] Brother Ben Drake is asking that we'd
[12:35] remember Rhea who's home this morning
[12:37] sick with a fever. And also our sister
[12:40] Deborah Hilda Brandt is sick at home as
[12:42] well. Brother Sir Roy asking that we'd
[12:45] remember his brother-in-law who's just
[12:46] been diagnosed with cancer. and also for
[12:48] a sister who's this has been very hard
[12:50] on her. Amen. A number of needs in the
[12:53] body. Brother Tim Girtz and we'd
[12:55] remember a friend Alisa who's having
[12:58] some difficulty.
[13:00] Amen. He sees every need no matter how
[13:01] great or small. I believe that this
[13:03] morning. So why don't we just sing reach
[13:05] out and touch the Lord. I believe you'll
[13:07] find he's not too busy. Amen. He
[13:09] promised he would never leave us nor
[13:10] forsake us. Amen. I'm going to ask our
[13:12] brother Tom. Thomas could have brother
[13:14] Tom Holmes that he would just come and
[13:16] open the service in a word of prayer as
[13:17] we sing this chorus. Reach out and touch
[13:19] the Lord.
[13:22] Oh, reach out and touch the Lord.
[13:28] As he
[13:30] goes by, you will find he's not too busy
[13:38] to hear your heart's cry. He is passing
[13:45] by this moment
[13:49] to supply.
[13:52] Oh, reach out
[13:54] and touch the Lord
[13:57] as he
[14:01] once more. not reach out and touch the
[14:06] whole as
[14:10] by you will find
[14:14] not to disease
[14:17] till he
[14:19] [Music]
[14:22] passes
[14:24] [Music]
[14:29] the
[14:31] Reach out
[14:34] the Lord.
[14:40] Oh, reach out.
[14:43] Trust the Lord.
[14:46] I see
[14:48] your mind.
[14:50] You'll find
[14:52] he's not too busy
[14:55] to hear your heart.
[15:00] He's passing
[15:02] by this moment.
[15:09] Reach out,
[15:11] touch the
[15:16] [Music]
[15:19] Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[15:24] Father, we're so amazed
[15:28] at the grace of God within all of our
[15:30] lives that are represented here.
[15:33] We look down on one another's face
[15:37] and we see the amazing grace of God that
[15:39] has reached down
[15:41] so down and lifted us upon that glorious
[15:46] rock of revelation
[15:48] to see you high and lifted up. We want
[15:50] to lift up our hands this morning. We
[15:52] want to lift up our voices. We want to
[15:55] raise our hearts. We want to give you
[15:56] all the glory, the honor, and praise for
[15:59] you are worthy of it, Lord, this morning
[16:01] as we have come to the house of God to
[16:04] honor the resurrection. To know, Lord,
[16:06] that you said, "Because I live, you
[16:08] shall live also." Lord, as your prophet
[16:10] said, he's speaking to the bride. That
[16:13] same quickening power that raised Christ
[16:15] from the dead, if it dwells in you, it
[16:17] shall also quicken your mortal bodies.
[16:20] We can say, "Lord, we've been quickened,
[16:21] but quicken us more. Lord, quicken us by
[16:24] your word this morning as our pastor
[16:26] will come. Let the revelation strike our
[16:28] soul. Let the Holy Ghost quicken every
[16:31] heart, every life that you are the same
[16:33] yesterday, today, and forever." These
[16:36] are requests that have been made known
[16:38] to us, Lord. And we are the body of
[16:40] Jesus Christ. And we can be also touched
[16:43] by the feeling of their infirmity. But
[16:45] it's not us they want to reach. They
[16:47] want to reach you, the great high priest
[16:49] that can be touched this morning, Lord.
[16:51] That we could just touch the hem of your
[16:53] garment. As brother Ryan has read these
[16:56] requests and hearts and hands have been
[16:58] raised. You are the same God that spoke
[17:02] to the woman at the well. You're the
[17:04] same God that spoke to the storm. You're
[17:07] the same God that came down today and
[17:09] spoke to Hatti Wright, gave their souls,
[17:13] their sons souls, salvation. That same
[17:17] God is amongst us this morning. Same one
[17:20] that said, "Little fishy, I give you
[17:22] your life is the same God that is
[17:25] amongst the bride of Jesus Christ." And
[17:27] so Lord, as I lay my hands upon these
[17:30] requests and hearts are lifted up, Lord,
[17:32] may that same God come on the scene and
[17:35] answer every need, every request, Lord,
[17:39] for the glory of God. Let that same
[17:41] life, Lord,
[17:44] speak to every heart. And if there be
[17:46] any dead in their sins and trespasses,
[17:49] may the quickening power of God reach
[17:52] down to their soul and awaken them,
[17:55] Lord, to the life in Christ Jesus. We're
[17:59] thankful for the prayers of the saints,
[18:00] Lord, over this last weeks.
[18:04] Lord, we're thankful for each one that
[18:06] has done their part for the body of
[18:09] Christ. So Lord, would you bless each
[18:11] and everyone that is gathered this
[18:13] morning? In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[18:17] [Music]
[18:22] Amen. God bless you. You have your
[18:24] seats.
[18:26] Once again, we just want to welcome
[18:28] everyone into the house of the Lord this
[18:29] morning. Those joining us by way of
[18:32] hookup on the internet or phone, just
[18:33] want to say God bless you as well. And
[18:36] we do have a couple announcements. We
[18:37] want to remember young people's meeting
[18:39] this Friday
[18:41] um March the 8th at 7:30. I believe
[18:44] that's on the 5th and 6th seals. So
[18:47] again, that's this Friday the 8th. At
[18:48] 7:30 there's a young people's meeting
[18:50] here at the church. And also our brother
[18:52] Kyle and sister Christina Morton are
[18:54] very happy to announce the arrival of
[18:56] Simeon Zachary Morton, born February the
[18:59] 28th, 2013 at 5:43 a.m. An early riser,
[19:03] 8 lb 14 o and all are doing well. Amen.
[19:07] Our bless brother Kyle and Christina.
[19:10] Amen. Why don't we sing He Led the Way
[19:12] at Calvary number 955.
[19:17] Amen. I'm also just going to ask the
[19:18] brother and if they would prepare for
[19:19] the morning offering as we sing this an
[19:21] old hymn we don't sing very often. I
[19:24] found a special tape probably from 93 or
[19:26] '94 and Sister Ruth was singing on there
[19:28] and I just thought it was such a
[19:30] wonderful thing to hear and so I wanted
[19:31] to sing that this morning. Aren't you
[19:33] thankful he led the way to peace for
[19:35] each one of us at Calvary? Amen. So,
[19:37] let's sing this as the brethren would
[19:38] come and prepare for the morning
[19:40] offering.
[19:42] Start with the first verse. I see the
[19:46] cross.
[19:49] I see the thorns.
[19:54] I see the place
[19:59] a soul was born.
[20:04] His agonizing
[20:07] feet.
[20:09] Oh Lord, remember me.
[20:14] And Jesus led the way to peace at
[20:20] Calary.
[20:22] He led the way. He led the way
[20:29] at Calary.
[20:31] [Music]
[20:34] From darkest night
[20:37] [Music]
[20:39] to endless day.
[20:44] He heard my ear.
[20:48] Oh Lord, remember me.
[20:53] Then Jesus led the way to peace at
[20:59] Calary.
[21:02] Brother, would you send us the blessing
[21:03] of the morning offering?
[21:05] [Music]
[21:09] Let's bow.
[21:10] Heavenly Father, we just thank you once
[21:12] again, Lord God, for another day to
[21:15] serve you, Lord. Jesus, when this flesh
[21:18] fights against us, uh right from in the
[21:20] morning, Lord, uh and tries to slow us
[21:23] down, we just come to you, Lord God,
[21:25] asking you to refill our cup, Father
[21:28] God. We want to serve you. We want to
[21:30] love you, Lord God. We want to reflect
[21:33] who you are, not who we are in the
[21:35] flesh. We ask you just to bless this
[21:36] offering, Lord God. Bless the people
[21:38] forgiving those who can, those who
[21:40] can't. You see the desire and the intent
[21:42] of every heart. We commit it to you now
[21:44] in your blessed name of the Lord Jesus
[21:46] Christ. We pray. Amen.
[21:50] Second verse. Brother Roberto. The
[21:52] soldier saw
[21:56] the darkness
[21:58] fall.
[22:01] He felt the clay.
[22:06] Heard Christ call
[22:11] his knees dropped to the star.
[22:16] He cried the son of God.
[22:21] Then Jesus led the way.
[22:25] Jes.
[22:29] He led away. He led the way. He led the
[22:34] way.
[22:37] Oh, at Calories
[22:40] from the darkest night
[22:45] to endless day.
[22:50] He heard my earest sing.
[22:54] Oh Lord, remember
[22:58] me
[22:59] and Jesus.
[23:01] [Music]
[23:06] I see the cross
[23:09] and I see the cross.
[23:14] The Savior
[23:16] leading
[23:18] us. I hear him roar.
[23:22] I know even mercy.
[23:29] Forgive these solders too.
[23:33] They know not what they do.
[23:38] Then Jesus led the way.
[23:43] He at Calary. Amen. He led the way. Oh,
[23:48] he led the way.
[23:52] at Calary.
[23:57] From darkest night
[24:02] to endless day
[24:07] he heard
[24:09] my earnest speed.
[24:12] Oh Lord, remember me.
[24:17] and Jesus led away to peace at Calary.
[24:24] And we're going to sing the chorus
[24:25] another couple times. Choir to come and
[24:27] sing. Amen. They have a chorus. We're
[24:29] going to teach the congregation. Spirit
[24:31] of God moves. So why don't you come just
[24:33] as we sing the chorus a couple more
[24:34] times.
[24:36] He led the way. Oh yes, he did.
[24:43] Oh, at Calary
[24:46] from darkest night
[24:50] to endless day
[24:56] he heard my earnestly.
[25:01] Oh Lord, remember me.
[25:06] And Jesus led the way to peace at how
[25:12] once more he led the way. Oh, he led the
[25:17] way.
[25:21] at Calary.
[25:22] [Music]
[25:25] From darkest night
[25:30] to endless day
[25:35] to earth my earest pain.
[25:40] Oh Lord, remember me
[25:45] and Jesus led the way.
[25:49] peace at Calary.
[25:57] Amen.
[25:58] We also have one more announcement we
[26:01] need to make. Our sister Isabelle Weber
[26:04] along with brother Doug and sister Karen
[26:06] Hendrickson are proud to announce the
[26:08] engagement of their children, Scott

[35:17] Lord, and fail
[35:21] me.
[35:23] [Music]
[35:28] [Applause]
[35:38] May that be our prayer.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:49] We're going to uh turn the service uh in
[35:52] a little different direction. We're
[35:55] going to take a portion of the meeting
[35:56] now and direct it towards Africa.
[36:02] We have a group that are going from the
[36:05] school senior
[36:08] uh some of our seniors and different
[36:10] ones are going to be a part to chaperone
[36:14] to be part of it. But this group is not
[36:17] going for a tourist vis a tourist
[36:21] vacation.
[36:22] This is a working
[36:24] working group. and I want to say a few
[36:27] words about it. and uh to those that are
[36:31] going and we're going to have prayer
[36:35] uh for them. We're going to hear also
[36:37] from brother Tatch
[36:41] who's the principal of the school
[36:44] who has
[36:46] uh contributed very very much to keeping
[36:50] the school in a spiritual atmosphere
[36:54] and the teachers and the staff.
[36:57] I don't only want to commend them, but I
[37:00] want to thank them for stepping to the
[37:03] plate and maintaining
[37:05] the kind of atmosphere that we need for
[37:08] our young people to mature and to grow
[37:12] in. And we're proud of our young people.
[37:16] We're very thankful for their hunger for
[37:18] God and thankful that we have such uh
[37:22] faculty and staff for them. Then after
[37:26] brother Terry
[37:29] uh makes his comments, then brother Kim
[37:32] Dingwall will make some comments because
[37:36] brother Kim
[37:38] uh has uh has contributed very much
[37:41] towards the
[37:43] arrangements
[37:45] and the mission part and uh the working
[37:48] part of of what the young people are
[37:52] going to do once they're over there.
[37:55] Brother Tim Dodd then will make his
[37:58] comments and this is all in the next we
[38:01] hope 15 20 minutes or so. So we're we're
[38:05] making it part of the service
[38:07] and uh brother brother Tim will be
[38:09] speaking over there at uh at perhaps
[38:13] different churches.
[38:14] We'll also be conducting a wedding for
[38:17] brother Bus Aaboosei
[38:19] uh who no doubt is streaming the service
[38:21] just now. But brother Bus is a wonderful
[38:25] worker and I know that the young people
[38:27] are going to be impressed
[38:29] uh with our brother's energy and his
[38:31] vision and burden. It's genuine.
[38:35] I would like to say also that
[38:41] uh my heart has been touched recently
[38:44] with regards to this part of the world
[38:49] and the continent of Africa is very very
[38:51] different than when we first went there.
[38:53] As is India,
[38:55] as is Russia and things are changing
[38:59] quickly in the world. We know that
[39:02] things are changing rapidly, so rapidly
[39:06] in China and we're so happy to have
[39:08] brother Tom returned back uh from China
[39:12] and brother Murphy still there.
[39:16] Uh brother Michael, they've been doing
[39:18] some video work and we don't want to get
[39:20] into that. We'll hear a lot about that
[39:22] later.
[39:24] Uh but with regards to Uganda,
[39:27] Brother Brandham mentions Uganda
[39:30] uh eight times
[39:33] and one of those times I was on the
[39:35] platform
[39:37] because it was in Victoria
[39:40] and I don't know whether we were
[39:42] successful in having that clip. We do
[39:44] have that clip. Perhaps you could just
[39:47] play it now. Would you do that?
[39:54] This is my 11th straight meeting and I'm
[39:57] really tired and I got to leave tomorrow
[40:01] night now after the service to make it
[40:03] down to
[40:05] got to go to move down to Tucson,
[40:08] Arizona from there to maybe to Phoenix.
[40:11] I got to go then up on the Alaskan
[40:13] Highway for a little rest. I'm going up
[40:15] with a friend, brother Eddie here and
[40:17] there. I got to be back up prayer around
[40:19] 1st of August and really on the move and
[40:23] then coming back and going overseas over
[40:26] to to tan Janica and Uganda and and down
[40:32] into South Africa and all just make a
[40:36] world tour around. Trying to be back
[40:38] again by next spring if the Lord
[40:41] willing. and he wants me to continue on
[40:44] trying in evangelism to for his glory.
[40:51] Amen.
[40:54] Apostle Paul never got to East Africa,
[40:58] Uganda, brother Brandham says Tanzanica,
[41:01] which is Tanzania.
[41:03] Now, Apostle Paul never got to Kenya,
[41:07] Burundi.
[41:12] never got to Zambia, Zimbabwe,
[41:15] Malawi,
[41:18] Congo,
[41:20] never got there.
[41:22] And brother Brandham wanted to get there
[41:24] and he mentions this several times. I
[41:27] have other other quotes right here also
[41:30] where he was speaking of brother Matson
[41:32] Boze, brother Joseph Matson Boz who I
[41:36] also knew quite well and uh brother
[41:40] Matson Boze he he just calls him such a
[41:44] sweet brother and he said he has schools
[41:46] over there in Tanzanica which was
[41:49] Tanzania
[41:51] into Kenya and Uganda and he mentions
[41:54] those all the time and how he was going
[41:56] to go over there.
[41:59] Uh he he said then he was not able to go
[42:02] as a missionary.
[42:04] Uh but he had to go as a hunter
[42:07] and when he did go in 1965 they didn't
[42:09] allow him to minister to preach.
[42:13] Brother brother brother Brandham never
[42:14] got there.
[42:16] The the message through him he had a
[42:18] desire to to speak to evangelize and to
[42:23] bring this message. This was in 1962
[42:26] that he spoke this. This was actually in
[42:28] Victoria. That's why I was on the
[42:30] platform.
[42:32] And uh now here we are all these years
[42:35] later. This is 2013.
[42:39] I would never have dreamed in my wildest
[42:42] imagination
[42:43] that we'd have a church like this with
[42:45] you wonderful people
[42:49] who have given your lives to Christ and
[42:52] to this message. And to think that many
[42:55] of you were born
[42:58] uh right in this church and you have
[43:01] been baptized and you have heard the
[43:05] gospel through the various means through
[43:08] individuals and through maybe speakers
[43:10] at the camp or speakers here or the
[43:13] ministry here and God has moved and I
[43:16] was thinking of this earlier moved on
[43:18] you individually and that's really
[43:20] wonderful. It hasn't been like some
[43:22] great emotional
[43:24] uh pull and having people around and you
[43:28] know one crying and another one weeping
[43:31] and then everybody have like a mass
[43:34] baptism hasn't happened happened like
[43:36] last Sunday where just two young men all
[43:40] on their own at different times asked to
[43:44] see the ministry and brother Randy I
[43:47] mean brother uh Ryan Snow and brother
[43:51] Sam uh Peter and Sheila's son both of
[43:57] them are baptized last Sunday and uh
[44:01] brother Brandham never got to go to
[44:04] Uganda and those countries and
[44:07] furthermore
[44:10] I had a brother who is seated here
[44:13] listening
[44:15] and it was in my car and I have to give
[44:17] this as part of my testimony family.
[44:20] Uh we're sitting driving in the car.
[44:23] I've spent most of my life with an
[44:26] insatiable
[44:28] desire and single vision to get this
[44:32] prophet's message to the people. I think
[44:35] they need to have that message to the
[44:37] people. And then the men that go over
[44:40] and minister and so on, they can
[44:42] minister, but the people have a
[44:43] grounding in the message. But this
[44:46] brother that is uh sitting here
[44:49] listening to me now, he just looked at
[44:51] me. He said, "We've been getting books
[44:56] of the prophet's message everywhere." He
[44:58] said, "What about the people that can't
[45:00] read?"
[45:02] And I was stunned
[45:05] into silence.
[45:07] He said, "They can only hear." And then
[45:10] he begins to speak about East Africa. He
[45:13] said there are millions of people
[45:16] cannot read.
[45:18] How do we get this message to them?
[45:23] He said they listen to the radio.
[45:27] And I said who has radio stations there?
[45:30] He said the Catholic Church has their
[45:32] own station.
[45:34] The United Nations have their own
[45:36] station.
[45:38] The BBC have their own station.
[45:41] But he said even I feel so burdened.
[45:45] I'm prepared to do whatever I need to do
[45:49] and the the message needs to be in
[45:51] Swahili
[45:52] because the people speak Swah the
[45:54] Swahili language.
[45:57] So I'm speaking this to everyone but
[45:59] especially to those that are going.
[46:04] Brother Brandham never got Apostle Paul
[46:06] never got to go. Uh John the Baptist
[46:08] never got to go.
[46:11] that now you're able to go
[46:14] &gt;&gt; and you've got your youth before you.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; You should be going there with an
[46:19] absolutely an open heart.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Move, oh Holy Spirit.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; What do you want me to be? What effect
[46:26] am I to have?
[46:28] &gt;&gt; What is my further education? If I was
[46:31] going to take any further education, it
[46:33] would be along the lines where I could
[46:35] bless the bride of Jesus Christ
[46:38] &gt;&gt; and have a reward
[46:41] &gt;&gt; on down the road
[46:43] &gt;&gt; that I I I allowed the Holy Spirit to
[46:45] consume me
[46:47] &gt;&gt; with what really matters in this life.
[46:50] This is the voice of Jesus Christ.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; And there's multitudes
[46:56] that can't hear. And if you would talk
[46:58] to them,
[47:00] uh, they would want to know what is it
[47:03] that you have
[47:06] and you have this opportunity
[47:08] and it's a glorious opportunity. I've
[47:10] seen people settle down in life and I
[47:13] would urge this congregation.
[47:17] We work and that's what we need to do.
[47:20] We provide for our families. That's what
[47:22] we need to do. But we should have one
[47:24] single v vision. Whatever it is that I
[47:27] do, God gives you family, raise the
[47:29] family
[47:31] &gt;&gt; for the glory of God.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; God gives you a promotion or gives you a
[47:35] job or gives you some increase or
[47:38] something. Always keep in mind the work
[47:42] of the Lord.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Plan to give.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Not necessarily money only, but give of
[47:48] your life.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Give of your time. Give of the strength
[47:52] that God gives you. for one day you may
[47:54] not have that strength. So always have
[47:57] that as foremost in your mind.
[48:02] I want to have our brother
[48:04] uh Terry Tatch, Mr. Tatch is known as
[48:08] the school
[48:17] and I like when they call
[48:19] our brother Tatch Mr. Tatch. God bless
[48:22] you.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. God bless
[48:25] you.
[48:31] This will be uh rather short, but
[48:33] brother Brandham tells the story uh
[48:36] often when he's talking in adoption
[48:38] and he tells about uh the father and
[48:42] he'll hand over his son uh to a tutor
[48:46] and the tutor is often with the the the
[48:49] son the child and he often he'll be with
[48:53] the child and at a certain point he'll
[48:55] get to a place where he gives a report
[48:57] on how the son's doing
[49:00] and and I think this is similar to that
[49:04] uh in that it's nice that I can come and
[49:06] I can give a positive report
[49:08] &gt;&gt; for our young people
[49:11] and brother Biscll said you know we're
[49:13] proud of them and we don't say it enough
[49:15] but we're very proud of our young people
[49:18] &gt;&gt; and it's been nice I've been uh with the
[49:20] school now for four years as a principal
[49:23] uh so I've seen them grow up from uh
[49:26] grade nine
[49:27] And now they'll be graduating. And it's
[49:30] neat to see them come to maturity.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; And it's it's not so much now where uh
[49:37] where in the past, you know, you'd you'd
[49:40] give them and you'd give, but now you
[49:41] can watch them moving into their place.
[49:44] Uh and and I I see it daily at school uh
[49:48] from our devotions. The the young people
[49:50] will start doing the devotions, they'll
[49:52] play the music, they'll lead the songs.
[49:56] uh just to the daily operations. I I
[49:58] come to church, I see them on the
[50:00] cameras. Uh I see them doing the Sunday
[50:03] school, helping with Sunday school,
[50:05] &gt;&gt; and it's just nice to say, you know, we
[50:08] have a good report.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Our our young people are doing well.
[50:13] And then uh on last Wednesday we had our
[50:17] our family assembly
[50:20] and the young people got up and they
[50:22] were just telling us about their trip
[50:24] because a lot of the students didn't
[50:26] know what was going to happen and
[50:27] brother Kimmel will probably highlight
[50:28] some of that. Uh but you know, just to
[50:31] hear hear what's on their hearts and
[50:33] they're talking about, you know, helping
[50:36] widows with their livelihoods and these
[50:37] are believers or or putting roofs on on
[50:40] churches and and on widows buildings and
[50:43] and just giving out.
[50:46] And to me, to me, my one thought after
[50:48] they were done, I thought, you know, for
[50:50] so long we've ministered to these young
[50:52] people, and it's neat to see what's in
[50:55] them, and now they're starting to
[50:56] minister. Amen.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; So, we're just we're proud of our young
[51:01] people.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; We've got a good report of our young
[51:04] people.
[51:06] And I'll just hand it over. Brother Ed,
[51:08] did you want Brother
[51:16] Kim? Good. Thanks, brother Terry.
[51:26] Good morning.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Well, it's certainly a wonderful
[51:30] opportunity we have to travel to to
[51:32] Africa with this group of young people.
[51:34] There just such a fine group of young
[51:36] men and and and women. I can only say
[51:38] amen to what brother Terry said already.
[51:40] Um,
[51:42] you know, we thought in the be in it
[51:44] last summer, we should be thinking about
[51:46] taking the young people to a to a on a
[51:49] missions trip really to give them an
[51:51] opportunity to give back, give them an
[51:53] opportunity to maybe express the gifts
[51:56] that are in their lives. And so, um, we
[52:00] we were praying about it, trying to
[52:01] decide which direction to go. And then
[52:03] Uganda came on my heart and we started
[52:05] talking to brother Steven Abali in
[52:07] Uganda about what there were for needs
[52:09] there and what needed to be done in that
[52:11] country. And we saw right away just the
[52:14] Holy Spirit beginning to move. And then
[52:16] brother Biscll talked to me about the
[52:17] brother that talked about audio for for
[52:20] East Africa and you could just see all
[52:22] the pieces coming together. Uh brother
[52:24] Tim Dodd was planning to go to do a
[52:26] wedding and we shifted the wedding and
[52:28] that so that kind of brought it all
[52:29] together. So while we're in the country,
[52:33] we will be uh the the plan is to keep
[52:35] them so busy all day long to have, you
[52:37] know, from 8:00 in the morning till
[52:39] about 5:00, we're going to be working on
[52:40] physical projects. Everything from
[52:43] putting a roof on a church to a roof on
[52:45] a widow's home to uh there's going to be
[52:48] some of them digging ditches in a banana
[52:49] plantation. Um there's going to be uh
[52:53] we're going to be installing print
[52:54] stations. We're taking six print
[52:56] stations that'll go all all over the
[52:58] country of Uganda. We're going to be
[53:00] working with the translators, teaching
[53:01] them how to translate and get their
[53:04] messages up onto the hub in text format.
[53:06] And then from what we learned from
[53:08] Brother Murphy, how he's got the English
[53:10] into audio format, we'll be setting up
[53:13] three recording studios while we're in
[53:14] Uganda that the brothers will be able to
[53:16] go in and record the messages in audio
[53:19] format to be able to get the messages
[53:21] out to the people. So, our intention is
[53:23] that every day we work from about 8:00
[53:26] to 5:00. We stop for supper. We get on a
[53:28] bus and we go to another village nearby,
[53:30] maybe a half an hour, an hour away, and
[53:33] uh have service. Brother Tim uh they
[53:35] they asked me, "Will Brother Tim Do want
[53:37] to be preaching?" And I said, "Well, you
[53:39] know, he's a pastor. He's used to
[53:40] preaching three times a week, and now
[53:41] he's only preaching three times a month,
[53:43] so I'm sure his haywagon is loaded. So,
[53:45] let's make sure we work him every day."
[53:49] So, that was my response to them. So, so
[53:53] they've done that. I think we have 15 or
[53:55] 16 services while we're in Uganda. Um,
[53:58] at least one a day and uh, and it's a
[54:01] working trip and my hope is that by the
[54:03] end of the day when they come home from
[54:05] their day of all day working, supper,
[54:08] driving out. The young people will be
[54:10] taking part in the services and singing
[54:12] and testifying and and and witnessing.
[54:15] We're looking at going to a prison and a
[54:17] hospital and an orphanage all for
[54:19] outreach. My hope is that by the time
[54:20] they get home at the end of the night,
[54:22] they'll be so tired they won't even
[54:23] notice those bugs in their bed.
[54:26] That's that's kind of the hope that we
[54:29] have. So So we are uh we're we're we're
[54:33] looking forward to going with this
[54:34] group. I'm I'm like usual running hard.
[54:37] I was up till all hours of the la the
[54:39] night last night getting computers ready
[54:41] for the for the print stations. Um
[54:43] there's still there's still a few needs.
[54:45] The young people, I'm just going to say
[54:46] this, the young people have been so
[54:48] diligent in raising funds for this. Um,
[54:51] you know, when you figure that it's
[54:52] going to cost $4 or $5,000 a person
[54:55] times 16 people, you can do the math
[54:56] pretty quick. And then on top of that,
[54:59] we've raised funds for a roof, for print
[55:02] stations, for, you know, we've raised a
[55:04] lot of money for for other things as
[55:06] well. There are still a few needs. So,
[55:08] those of you who have missed the
[55:10] opportunity to give towards this trip,
[55:12] we're not looking for any funding at
[55:14] this point for the students, for their
[55:15] travel or that, but anything that's
[55:17] raised now will be able to go directly
[55:19] to needs within the country. We still
[55:21] have a whole list of needs that we'd
[55:23] like to be able to meet while we're
[55:24] there. So, that's all I'm going to say
[55:28] about this trip this morning. I'm going
[55:29] to because this service is a little bit
[55:31] unusual, I'm going to be unusual this
[55:33] morning and take a little bit of a
[55:34] detour. I'd like to sing that song we
[55:37] sang already this morning. I have a
[55:38] father. And I'd like to get the words up
[55:40] right away so I could see it if I if I
[55:42] could. When I sing that song, I sing it
[55:44] a little bit different. And whenever I'm
[55:46] traveling on the field, that's the song
[55:48] I sing all day long. I have a father.
[55:50] And I don't sing He'll never leave me
[55:53] where wherever I go. I always sing he
[55:56] will ever lead me wherever I go. Because
[55:59] sons of God, it's not sons of God should
[56:01] be led by the spirit of God. Sons of God
[56:04] are led by the spirit of God. And so we
[56:07] go in that confidence. Those that are
[56:09] coming, God led them to come. Those of
[56:11] you that have given, God's led you to
[56:13] give. And I have two reasons for wanting
[56:17] to sing that song. One is because it's
[56:19] part of what we're talking about in
[56:20] God's leadership. The second is, can I
[56:22] have the second verse up, please?
[56:27] Um
[56:30] uh the first verse, sorry. I have a
[56:32] maker. We sang this this morning and it
[56:35] really touched my heart because we have
[56:38] a little girl in church with us this
[56:40] morning. Her name is Lyanna.
[56:43] She's 7 months old.
[56:46] She comes from Manitoba. It's Junior's
[56:48] cousin Joel and his wife and their
[56:50] little their little baby 7 months old
[56:52] who's going in tomorrow for open heart
[56:54] surgery.
[56:56] And I want want us to remember her in
[56:58] prayer. But when I saw the signs, the
[57:00] the words to this verse, I have a maker.
[57:04] He formed my heart.
[57:06] And before even time began, my life was
[57:09] in my h in his hand. I leaned over to
[57:12] Joel and I said, Joel, this is your
[57:13] verse. This is the verse for your little
[57:15] girl this morning. He formed the heart.
[57:19] She needs a new valve in her heart. And
[57:21] I want us to pray that God would so
[57:23] guide the hands of that surgeon.
[57:26] Her life is in his hands. Let's sing
[57:29] that chorus together.
[57:34] I have a maker
[57:39] [Music]
[57:41] before
[57:43] my heart.
[57:47] And before even time began,
[57:53] her life was in his hand.
[57:59] [Music]
[58:00] He knows my name.
[58:06] He knows my every thought.
[58:13] He sees each tearless voice
[58:18] and he hears me when I call.
[58:23] [Music]
[58:25] I have a father.
[58:29] [Music]
[58:31] He calls me his own.
[58:38] And he'll never
[58:40] lead me.
[58:43] No matter where I go,
[58:50] he knows my name.
[58:56] He knows my every thought.
[59:02] He sees each tear that falls and he
[59:08] hears me when I call.
[59:13] Let's just pray together this morning.
[59:16] Father, we bow in your presence, Lord.
[59:18] We're so thankful for your presence here
[59:20] this morning. We're so thankful for your
[59:22] mercy, Lord. Father, we think of our
[59:25] little sister Lyanna here this morning.
[59:27] Oh God, knowing that you formed her
[59:30] heart, oh God, you brought her to this
[59:33] moment this morning. You led her parents
[59:35] here this morning because sons and
[59:37] daughters of God are led by your spirit,
[59:39] Lord. And we pray, Lord Jesus, that
[59:42] tomorrow morning you'd stand beside that
[59:45] surgeon and guide every movement of his
[59:48] hand, oh God. We pray that your presence
[59:51] would be there, Lord. Lord, and we know
[59:54] that then the surgeon can cut and he can
[59:56] put things there, but we know that it
[59:58] takes you to come back and do the
[1:00:00] healing, oh God. Father, and we have
[1:00:02] this confidence in you, Lord, knowing
[1:00:05] that the promise is ours, Father. We
[1:00:08] pray that you touch little, Lord, and
[1:00:10] we'll rejoice and give you all the
[1:00:12] glory, oh God.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; We thank you this morning. Thank you,
[1:00:17] Lord Jesus. Amen.
[1:00:27] Amen. Have faith.
[1:00:30] Only believe. All things are possible to
[1:00:33] them that believe.
[1:00:36] Amen. Well, we certainly are uh
[1:00:40] very thankful in many ways to be a part
[1:00:42] of this uh occasion is not really the
[1:00:46] right word, but this event that is
[1:00:48] unfolding and it is a supernatural
[1:00:50] event. And I I've noticed that just by
[1:00:52] the way that it has come together in the
[1:00:55] way that all of the uh participatory
[1:00:58] parts have have gathered from the
[1:01:00] different areas and and whether it be
[1:01:02] brother Tatch and the teachers at school
[1:01:04] and the the growth of the young people
[1:01:07] to the brother Kim's involvement and his
[1:01:10] uh very capable involvement in in
[1:01:12] preparing and organizing the logistical
[1:01:14] side of this trip and being involved in
[1:01:17] the the natural needs. And I wasn't
[1:01:19] actually originally a part of the trip,
[1:01:21] but uh as brother Kim mentioned, there
[1:01:24] was a young brother whom brother Biscll
[1:01:26] had mentioned, Brother Busabosi, who
[1:01:28] specifically asked me to come do his
[1:01:30] wedding in January. And uh and and when
[1:01:33] he asked me, I it just kind of dropped
[1:01:35] in my heart that well, you know, if if
[1:01:37] he would move his wedding from January
[1:01:41] to March, then I would maybe take that
[1:01:44] as from the Lord that I'm supposed to go
[1:01:46] with the young people. And uh and so I
[1:01:50] just kind of replied in the email and I
[1:01:53] I knew myself if I was a young man
[1:01:55] getting married, there's no way I'm
[1:01:57] moving my wedding from January to March.
[1:02:02] I might move it from March to January.
[1:02:07] And uh so uh I just kind of replied to
[1:02:11] him and said, you know, it's too bad
[1:02:13] your wedding's in January. if it if it
[1:02:15] if it was in March, I might think of
[1:02:17] coming because we've got some young
[1:02:18] people going to Uganda. And I got a very
[1:02:21] quick reply and and said, you know, I
[1:02:23] just feel God would have me to change it
[1:02:25] and and told me several things that the
[1:02:27] Lord had spoken to him. And so, here we
[1:02:30] are a part of this trip.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; We believe that's of the Lord.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; I've been reminding the young people of
[1:02:37] one verse and that is uh 1 Timothy 4 and
[1:02:41] I keep I keep reading it to them. I'll
[1:02:43] read it to them again today. Let no man
[1:02:46] despise thy youth,
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; but be thou an example of the believers
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; in word, in conversation,
[1:02:56] in love, in spirit,
[1:03:00] in faith, in purity.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; And that's what these young people are.
[1:03:06] They are examples. And they are
[1:03:09] certainly mature enough to be examples.
[1:03:12] And that's what God would have them to
[1:03:14] be, not just what I would have them or
[1:03:17] the church. And as they're going as
[1:03:19] representatives of the vision of the
[1:03:22] church here through the uh um through
[1:03:25] the oposes of the school that the
[1:03:28] brother Biscll and the and the
[1:03:30] leadership here in their uh vision have
[1:03:33] helped to to establish. uh they are
[1:03:36] ambassadors of the vision of the message
[1:03:40] through Cloverdale Bible Way.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; It'll be a great experience and I I
[1:03:46] don't need to go into that. That's
[1:03:47] that's a given. But uh there are in the
[1:03:54] when we come to mission's work
[1:03:57] there there is one aspect in this end
[1:04:02] time that is significant because we
[1:04:05] realize that missions is about a bride
[1:04:09] that's going in a rapture.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; It's not just about uh winning souls.
[1:04:14] It's about getting those souls to the
[1:04:17] revelation of the word or as I've said
[1:04:18] before enabling the bride to hear the
[1:04:21] bridegroom's voice that she may respond
[1:04:25] to the voice and not just have the voice
[1:04:28] but have the bridegroom himself which
[1:04:30] the message is Christ and so that is
[1:04:34] what we are putting into their hands. So
[1:04:37] there's no shortage of needs in a
[1:04:39] country when you go to a place like
[1:04:41] Uganda and as as we look at it uh as far
[1:04:45] as ministers are concerned uh there
[1:04:48] there's never a shortage of needs.
[1:04:50] There's hundreds of churches there in
[1:04:52] the message of all sizes small and
[1:04:55] large.
[1:04:56] uh they need Bibles, they need message
[1:04:59] books, they need the message on MP3,
[1:05:02] they need audio, they might need
[1:05:04] buildings, they need roofs, they might
[1:05:06] need motorcycles, they might need
[1:05:08] bicycles, they need all sorts of things.
[1:05:11] But the greatest need there is the same
[1:05:13] as the greatest need here. And that is
[1:05:16] the bride must have access to the
[1:05:19] message.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; They have all those other things. And if
[1:05:23] they didn't have access to the message,
[1:05:26] what is the value of the other things?
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; And so the that is what as ministry we
[1:05:32] are focused upon. Having said that, I
[1:05:37] would quote the scripture again in
[1:05:40] Timothy that says, "Charge them that are
[1:05:43] rich in this world, that they be not
[1:05:45] high- minded, nor trust in uncertain
[1:05:48] riches, but in the living God, who
[1:05:51] giveth us richly all things to enjoy,
[1:05:55] that they do good, that they be rich in
[1:05:58] good works,
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; ready to distribute,
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; willing to communicate,
[1:06:05] laying up in store for themselves a good
[1:06:07] foundation against the time to come that
[1:06:10] they may laid hold on eternal life.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; So
[1:06:18] that is what we are doing. And I want to
[1:06:20] say I was talking to a a brother here
[1:06:24] not long ago whose income was about
[1:06:26] $1,500 a month and confessed himself to
[1:06:31] be very poor. And we in this society
[1:06:36] would feel if you only made $1,500 a
[1:06:39] month, you would indeed be very poor. I
[1:06:42] think we would say amen to that. Amen.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; However, if you made $1,500 a month in
[1:06:48] Uganda, you would be very rich.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; And so, it's all relative to the culture
[1:06:56] that you're living in. And so, we
[1:06:58] realize we have, they don't have, and we
[1:07:02] have now an opportunity to minister to
[1:07:05] them. Brother Kim has mentioned some of
[1:07:07] the natural needs and and some funds
[1:07:09] have come in towards those things and
[1:07:11] and we want to minister to them. But I
[1:07:14] will say no matter how much is given and
[1:07:17] we want to give all that God leads us to
[1:07:19] give, you'll never meet all the natural
[1:07:21] needs in a country like that. You'll
[1:07:23] never be able to. But we want to be led
[1:07:25] of God. And so I hope that you will pray
[1:07:28] for us
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; that as we encounter needs that God will
[1:07:32] direct us in what re limited resources
[1:07:35] we have to help where he wants us to
[1:07:39] help.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; So let me just make another comment or
[1:07:44] two and then I'll turn it back to
[1:07:45] brother Ed. Uh brother Kim has already
[1:07:47] mentioned uh meetings. There's 10
[1:07:50] services in the first week and uh
[1:07:53] brother Steven Ibali who brother Kim has
[1:07:56] mentioned is a senior ministry. I I met
[1:07:58] brother Steven for the first time about
[1:08:00] 25 years ago. We've known each other
[1:08:02] since that time. He's been with us in
[1:08:04] Grand Prairie and I've met him in
[1:08:06] different occasions in different places.
[1:08:07] He's been in meetings, ministers
[1:08:09] meetings that I've ministered and and
[1:08:11] that and he is one of the senior
[1:08:13] ministers in that country. And we're
[1:08:16] both looking forward to being with each
[1:08:17] other. And uh anytime that uh senior
[1:08:21] ministers come from North America to th
[1:08:24] to those countries, there's always an
[1:08:26] anticipation. And uh he said he's
[1:08:28] anticipating spending the time with me,
[1:08:31] but I'm anticipating and looking forward
[1:08:33] to spending the time with him and with
[1:08:35] other ministers. and we'll be with them
[1:08:37] around Ginger and traveling out from
[1:08:39] there for the first week. And I'm just
[1:08:40] sharing this with you so that you can be
[1:08:42] in prayer about it. Uh from there, after
[1:08:44] the first week, we will go to Matana
[1:08:47] where uh brother Bus's pastor, his
[1:08:50] church, and his pastor there, which I'll
[1:08:52] mention in a minute. Uh we'll visit a
[1:08:54] prison there and a hospital, Lord
[1:08:55] willing. on our way to a convention in
[1:08:59] Cassissi. Brother James Nanabandhi is
[1:09:02] there and uh sends his greetings and he
[1:09:05] says all preparation uh to welcome you
[1:09:09] in Cassissi are in high gear and many
[1:09:12] are planning to travel hundreds of
[1:09:14] kilometers to come and attend that
[1:09:18] two-day meeting. There'll actually be
[1:09:20] about roughly about 200 churches
[1:09:23] represented in that meeting. And so it's
[1:09:26] it's not just a a small little gathering
[1:09:29] and many many will be traveling hundreds
[1:09:32] of kilometers. And so we appreciate and
[1:09:36] it's not traveling on nice highways with
[1:09:39] uh uh nice new vehicles either. It's a
[1:09:43] great sacrifice for many of them to
[1:09:44] come. So please be praying about that.
[1:09:47] And then we from there we'll be going
[1:09:49] back to Matana uh where the wedding of
[1:09:52] brother Busabosi will be taking place
[1:09:55] which is kind of for me the lynch pin of
[1:09:58] the whole trip. And uh
[1:10:01] uh brother is pastor brother Leo
[1:10:05] Ruaba and forgive me brother Lee if I
[1:10:08] said that wrong. He'll probably watch
[1:10:10] this service this morning. I haven't
[1:10:12] asked him yet how to pronounce his name.
[1:10:14] We've been trying to connect on the
[1:10:15] phone but haven't yet.
[1:10:17] and uh we haven't met but he is the
[1:10:19] pastor of brother uh Basaboszi whom we
[1:10:22] call brother Bus for short and uh he
[1:10:26] I'll just read you his greetings he says
[1:10:28] we appreciate your sacrifice and support
[1:10:30] towards the wedding of our son and uh
[1:10:33] when I saw brother Steven that's brother
[1:10:35] Steven Ibali paying for your
[1:10:37] accommodation in Mitana as brother
[1:10:39] Steven has been arranging some of our
[1:10:41] accommodation he says I was very happy
[1:10:44] he says we really thank God who opened a
[1:10:46] door for us to be in fellowship with
[1:10:49] Cloverdale Bible Way Ministry through
[1:10:51] the videos distributed by Brother Bus.
[1:10:54] They they have brought revival to my
[1:10:56] family, church members, and many
[1:10:59] brethren who received them. All glory
[1:11:02] back to God.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Greetings to Pastor Eddie
[1:11:06] Biscll and your family and the saints.
[1:11:10] We love you so much." And so you see
[1:11:13] they already feel a part of us
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; and we're going there to be a part of
[1:11:16] them and a part of the wedding. And uh
[1:11:18] we consider brother Bus to be a part of
[1:11:20] us. Uh I can't take wedding gifts with
[1:11:25] me. So please don't bring me any gifts
[1:11:29] of any large size. But if you want to
[1:11:31] send a card or a greeting or something
[1:11:34] that's that can easily fit into my uh
[1:11:37] luggage, then uh and again no no no
[1:11:39] wrapped gifts. I I my luggage is already
[1:11:41] too full. And uh so if you want to send
[1:11:44] something by way of to commemorate that
[1:11:47] and I I know that that would be a
[1:11:49] special blessing. And if you had
[1:11:51] something together by say Wednesday and
[1:11:54] uh was able to give it in at the office
[1:11:55] and let it know that it was for brother
[1:11:57] bus or whatever it might be, even if you
[1:11:59] wanted to give a little um monetary
[1:12:02] blessing and uh then uh you could do
[1:12:06] that. I did that for a reason.
[1:12:10] So, uh, we're also I just I got to end
[1:12:13] it here and give it back to brother Ed,
[1:12:14] but I want to just say, uh, remember
[1:12:17] Ethiopia in your prayers. That is
[1:12:20] something that has come up unusually so.
[1:12:22] And again, from several different
[1:12:24] sections and we're actually going to
[1:12:27] help brother Bus uh on his honeymoon to
[1:12:30] go to Ethiopia. He's an evangelist and
[1:12:33] he's going to take his wife with him
[1:12:34] into Ethiopia and try and establish some
[1:12:37] contacts there. on his honeymoon, which
[1:12:40] we don't know of any message believers
[1:12:42] or any churches in Ethiopia, a t a
[1:12:45] country of about 95 million people. And
[1:12:48] so, uh, and it's about 60%, uh,
[1:12:52] Christianbased.
[1:12:53] And so, uh, we we've had this burden and
[1:12:56] it looks like a door is opening. And so,
[1:12:58] pray for Ethiopia as well.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; And then, I don't know if brother Ed
[1:13:02] wanted me to mention, but after Uganda,
[1:13:04] we'll be going on through Europe. a
[1:13:07] brief stop in Paris and on to the
[1:13:09] meetings in Switzerland that will be
[1:13:11] happening there. And uh I'll just say uh
[1:13:14] when brother Ed asked me to long a
[1:13:18] little while ago after last year's
[1:13:19] meeting says, "Brother Tim, I'd really
[1:13:20] like you to pray about going to
[1:13:22] Switzerland." And uh and then I prayed
[1:13:24] about it. I said, "Lord, if if Brother
[1:13:26] Ed really feels pressed, I will go to
[1:13:29] Switzerland." That was how I was praying
[1:13:31] about it. And then and then he just a
[1:13:34] little while ago asked me, "Brother Tim,
[1:13:35] you have one day to decide, but I'd
[1:13:37] really like you to be in Switzerland."
[1:13:41] And and and I didn't need to decide. I'd
[1:13:43] already decided if he felt led, then I
[1:13:45] feel led. And so uh that's what I was on
[1:13:49] my heart. And so even though I don't get
[1:13:51] to come home, we just go right over to
[1:13:53] Switzerland. And uh and then when
[1:13:55] Brother Kim heard that I was going right
[1:13:56] over to Switzerland, he thought, "Why
[1:13:58] don't we all go over to Switzerland?"
[1:14:01] And uh there we go. We're all going to
[1:14:03] do that trip and it's going to be
[1:14:05] wonderful.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; And it's all to the glory of God.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[1:14:17] All right. God bless you. Uh I'd like to
[1:14:21] have the all the young people that are
[1:14:24] going on that uh trip if they would come
[1:14:28] to the front here please and stand here.
[1:14:30] I would like those that are going to
[1:14:32] attend and chaperone also on the trip
[1:14:36] and brother Terry if you would please
[1:14:39] come down. Mr. Tatch and brother
[1:14:42] Dingwall and brother
[1:14:47] Dodd if you would also be there.
[1:14:53] I'm going to do something a little bit
[1:14:56] different.
[1:14:58] Uh, brother Gindo,
[1:15:01] like to have you,
[1:15:04] brother,
[1:15:07] if you'd come and join us in standing
[1:15:09] behind these people.
[1:15:13] Brother Dominic
[1:15:15] Sankamina,
[1:15:20] Brother Ellie, if you would come and
[1:15:22] join us, please.
[1:15:24] I want all these brothers to stand
[1:15:27] behind.
[1:15:28] Uh
[1:15:32] do we have brother OED?
[1:15:34] I see you. Please come and join us.
[1:15:41] Oh, I don't know. Brother Daniel

[1:15:55] have you come and join us.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:16:24] These brethren all have different
[1:16:25] connections
[1:16:28] with Africa. Brother Okeello from Kenya,
[1:16:32] Nairobi, a number of these other
[1:16:34] brothers
[1:16:36] from different parts, Congo, Nigeria,
[1:16:40] wherever.
[1:16:42] We're not doing this as a
[1:16:45] some kind of a ceremony.
[1:16:47] But I believe that this is uh maybe the
[1:16:50] beginning of some things in the lives of
[1:16:54] these uh young men and young ladies
[1:17:00] and we we don't know what it's going to
[1:17:02] be.
[1:17:04] There was a course of a song that came
[1:17:06] to me and I don't know I'm I'm the only
[1:17:09] one that remembers it.
[1:17:13] can ask uh
[1:17:17] I don't know if you would know it or
[1:17:18] not, brother Hbrand. It is
[1:17:23] uh
[1:17:28] send a new touch of fire on my soul,
[1:17:31] Lord.
[1:17:32] Does anybody know that?
[1:17:36] Wow. You're going to know it in a few
[1:17:38] minutes.
[1:17:40] We're going to sing it also as a prayer.
[1:17:45] You're going to help me.
[1:17:47] Uh somebody's just learned it this
[1:17:49] morning. And I changed the words of one
[1:17:52] line. Send a new touch of fire on our
[1:17:56] souls. Lord, send it now. Lord, send it
[1:18:01] now.
[1:18:03] Fill our hearts today with the living
[1:18:06] word.
[1:18:07] Send a new touch of fire on our soul.
[1:18:11] Why don't you stand with us?
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; This a simple little course.
[1:18:19] Send a new touch of fire on my soul.
[1:18:25] Lord, send it now.
[1:18:29] Lord, send it now.
[1:18:32] Lord, fill our hearts today with the
[1:18:38] living
[1:18:40] word.
[1:18:42] Send a new touch of fire on our soul.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; And let's just make it personal. Send a
[1:18:50] new touch of fire on my soul, Lord. Send
[1:18:54] a new touch of fire on my soul,
[1:19:00] Lord. Send it now,
[1:19:04] Lord. Send it now,
[1:19:08] Lord. Fill our hearts today with the
[1:19:14] living
[1:19:16] word.

[1:19:36] Lord. Send it now,
[1:19:39] Lord, to our hearts
[1:19:43] today with the living
[1:19:47] word.
[1:19:49] Send a new touch of fire on my soul.
[1:19:54] Let's everyone sing it now. Send a new
[1:19:58] touch of fire on my soul,
[1:20:02] Lord. Send it now,
[1:20:06] Lord. Send it now,
[1:20:09] Lord. Filling hearts today with the
[1:20:15] living
[1:20:17] word.
[1:20:20] Send a new
[1:20:22] fire on my soul. I wonder if you'd like
[1:20:26] to raise your hand and surrender as we
[1:20:28] sing it again. Send a new touch of
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; fire on our soul.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Send it on my soul, Lord.

[1:20:42] Lord. Fill our hearts
[1:20:46] today with the living
[1:20:50] word.
[1:20:52] Send them to
[1:20:55] your heart on my soul.
[1:21:00] Oh, we all want to enter into prayer
[1:21:02] now. And I wonder if the brothers if
[1:21:04] you'd all just lay your hand on someone
[1:21:06] there in front of you. Some of these
[1:21:09] precious lives, young men, young women,
[1:21:12] how I wish I was your age again. Have
[1:21:14] this opportunity.
[1:21:16] [Music]
[1:21:17] Oh God,
[1:21:20] allseeing God, all knowing God, you hold
[1:21:24] the lives of each of these persons in
[1:21:27] your hand. And we are praying, Father,
[1:21:30] for a nation and a continent that still
[1:21:32] has very great needs and multitudes have
[1:21:36] not heard, have not even heard your
[1:21:38] name. Lord Jesus, we are praying that
[1:21:41] the new touch of fire, the fire of the
[1:21:45] Holy Ghost, let the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:49] Ghost, oh God, fill these lives, turn
[1:21:53] them into burning torches, oh God. And
[1:21:56] as they go and as they speak, as they
[1:21:59] act, and as they live, may men and
[1:22:02] women's eyes be open. and may they see
[1:22:05] Jesus Christ once again alive and
[1:22:09] living, speaking and doing. I pray that
[1:22:12] you will accompany this group with signs
[1:22:15] and wonders Lord and miracles. I pray,
[1:22:18] Father, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:22:20] you'll ignite something also in their
[1:22:22] heart that when they return, they will
[1:22:25] not be the same. Oh God, they'll be
[1:22:27] forever transformed by the transforming
[1:22:30] power. You've seen this before the
[1:22:32] foundation of the world. And I pray, oh
[1:22:35] God, your will will be done every day
[1:22:38] that you'll give special divine wisdom,
[1:22:40] Lord, to the brethren that will be uh
[1:22:43] guiding and attending. Give them the
[1:22:46] divine wisdom of the Holy Spirit. May
[1:22:48] the gift of the Holy Ghost be their
[1:22:50] part, Father. The gift of wisdom. I pray
[1:22:53] there'll be protection along the way. I
[1:22:56] pray you'll raise up a great wall of
[1:22:58] fire around him, Lord. there will be no
[1:23:01] no enemy. There will be no sickness.
[1:23:04] There will be no kind of thing that they
[1:23:06] will come back with a great testimony.
[1:23:08] Oh father, I pray in the name of Jesus
[1:23:11] that there will be something eternal
[1:23:12] done. Lord, I know that it will be so.
[1:23:15] Pray you'll anoint our brother Kim D as
[1:23:18] he speaks. Oh God, our brother Kim
[1:23:20] Dingwall as he guides, oh Father, into
[1:23:23] the different missions areas. Pray Lord
[1:23:26] Jesus for the sisters that are attending
[1:23:28] Sister Heddy and all those sisters that
[1:23:30] are going with I pray that you will
[1:23:32] bless them immensely and I know that
[1:23:35] you'll make them a blessing. Father we
[1:23:37] dedicate them to you in a new way in a
[1:23:41] special way. All of them have been
[1:23:43] dedicated as children as babies. They
[1:23:46] didn't know what was happening then but
[1:23:48] now they do. They know what is
[1:23:50] happening. I'm giving myself to you in
[1:23:53] the name of Jesus Christ. Bless this
[1:23:54] congregation, Father. Bless the word,
[1:23:57] Father. Open our hearts and cause just
[1:24:00] some words to be spoken, Lord, that
[1:24:02] would be appropriate at this time in
[1:24:05] Jesus name. Amen.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you each one as you find
[1:24:12] your seats and others remain standing if
[1:24:14] you would please. Uh I would like to say
[1:24:16] that
[1:24:18] this evening we we'll uh we'll just
[1:24:21] receive a an offering. Uh if you can
[1:24:25] remember to give if you can't we can we
[1:24:27] can pass the buckets also this evening
[1:24:30] offering. But if you just like to give
[1:24:32] something for Uganda
[1:24:34] and uh and uh the needs that will they
[1:24:37] will face along the way. This is the
[1:24:39] first I've heard of it just now. But
[1:24:41] please you can just put it on the
[1:24:43] envelope. Buganda or Africa or whatever
[1:24:45] you wish and we'll see that it goes
[1:24:47] there. It doesn't have to be large. It
[1:24:49] can be big. It can be small. It doesn't
[1:24:51] make any difference whichever way. All
[1:24:54] right. Do you mind if I take a little
[1:24:56] time with the word now?
[1:24:58] All right. I'm not going to keep you
[1:25:00] long because I wanted this to be a part
[1:25:03] a definite part of the service. Please
[1:25:05] take your Bibles if you would and turn
[1:25:07] to Colossians and we'll read.
[1:25:13] I'm going to be just as brief as I can.
[1:25:16] I'm carrying on from last week.
[1:25:20] I don't know if you'll recognize that
[1:25:22] we're carrying on from last week, but
[1:25:25] trust you will.
[1:25:29] In Colossians the 1 chapter, I want to
[1:25:31] read from the 15th verse. And this is
[1:25:34] the scripture reading for the message
[1:25:36] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:25:40] And um if you'll just keep your mind
[1:25:44] really focused so I can move as quickly
[1:25:46] as possible
[1:25:49] starting with verse 15. Who is the image
[1:25:51] of the invisible God, the firstborn of
[1:25:54] every creature? For by him were all
[1:25:57] things created that are in heaven and
[1:25:59] that are in earth, visible and
[1:26:01] invisible, whether they be thrones or
[1:26:04] dominions or principalities or powers.
[1:26:08] All things were created by him and for
[1:26:10] him. And he is before all things, and by
[1:26:14] him all things consist. And he is the
[1:26:16] head of the body, the church, who is the
[1:26:19] beginning and the firstborn from the
[1:26:21] dead, that in all things he might have
[1:26:24] the preeminence. For it pleased the
[1:26:26] Father that in him should all fullness
[1:26:29] dwell. In verse 26,
[1:26:34] even the mystery which hath been hid
[1:26:36] from ages and from generations, but now
[1:26:40] is made manifest in his saints, to whom
[1:26:43] God would make known what is the riches
[1:26:45] of the glory of this mystery among the
[1:26:48] Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the
[1:26:51] hope of glory,
[1:26:53] whom we preach, warning every man and
[1:26:55] teaching every man in all wisdom, that
[1:26:58] we may present every man perfect in
[1:27:00] Christ Jesus, where unto I also labor,
[1:27:05] striving according to his working, which
[1:27:07] workketh in me mightily. Amen. May God
[1:27:10] bless you as you have your seats. I have
[1:27:13] other scripture I want to read. So, keep
[1:27:15] your Bible open if you would please. I
[1:27:18] want to thank all the people that
[1:27:20] participated and and uh uh I want you to
[1:27:24] know that this is not just a missions
[1:27:26] journey that these uh the young people
[1:27:28] and the others are going on. Uh there is
[1:27:31] a very very specific thing. We are
[1:27:34] looking forward to a possibility of
[1:27:38] reaching people multitudes of people
[1:27:41] that do not read.
[1:27:44] We're looking even if it even if it
[1:27:47] requires a radio station.
[1:27:51] I want you to know that there has been
[1:27:53] also
[1:27:55] uh uh there has been com not commitment
[1:27:58] but there has been expression that even
[1:28:00] if it require that one day we were a
[1:28:03] small group perhaps as many people maybe
[1:28:05] as here right here in those seats that's
[1:28:08] about the size we were and we wanted to
[1:28:11] get the message out so we made inquiry
[1:28:14] around and and soon we were on 25
[1:28:16] stations in Hawaii and Africa up in
[1:28:20] Yukon, all over North America and and
[1:28:24] Canada and the United States especially.
[1:28:26] And God gave us favor when other people
[1:28:29] were scrambling for just very very
[1:28:32] desiring very desirous stations here.
[1:28:35] God put it in the hearts of people who
[1:28:37] are decision makers to call us and say,
[1:28:40] "Do you want this slot? Do you want this
[1:28:42] time?" And they got us on a skip wave in
[1:28:44] the United States on WWL New Orleans on
[1:28:47] 50,000 watts. That's not FM. That's AM.
[1:28:51] 50,000 watts. We were on KGO. 50,000
[1:28:54] watts. We were on San Francisco. We were
[1:28:57] in Los Angeles. We were also in Swazi
[1:29:00] music radio. 100,000 watt Swazi music
[1:29:03] radio covering an area of 87 million
[1:29:06] people all the way from Mosmbique down
[1:29:10] Malawi and Zambia and all over South and
[1:29:13] Southwest Africa. and and and we we
[1:29:16] didn't God just arranged it and we just
[1:29:18] go ahead with it and God always
[1:29:21] provides. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now
[1:29:24] we're a larger group of people and I
[1:29:26] would say that the the the force and the
[1:29:29] desire remains the same.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; And if God opens the door by God's
[1:29:34] strength and God's help, we'll go
[1:29:35] through it. Can the congregation say
[1:29:37] amen to that? That's our mission. And
[1:29:40] when it's over, we're going to go and
[1:29:42] rejoice around a marriage supper. And
[1:29:45] you'll rejoice that we had that kind of
[1:29:47] vision that stands behind this pulpit.
[1:29:50] And it's always the vision. That is the
[1:29:52] commission.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; The commission is to take it to all the
[1:29:55] world.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; And when we've got a message that we
[1:29:58] know that the neighbor hasn't got, all
[1:30:01] the world might be next door. And we
[1:30:03] don't want you to feel that you you
[1:30:05] you're not important. You're very
[1:30:07] important. You're an integral part of
[1:30:10] this whole program. God put you here for
[1:30:13] a reason. So, we say amen to that. Now,
[1:30:17] we read in the scripture,
[1:30:19] who is the image of the invisible God.
[1:30:23] And I want to just have you also turn in
[1:30:25] the in the scripture to Genesis if you
[1:30:27] would, the first chapter
[1:30:32] in verse 27:28.
[1:30:34] So, God created man. And now this is
[1:30:36] what I I want to I want to just have you
[1:30:38] focus very quickly on this and I'll be
[1:30:42] as concise as possible and you be as
[1:30:44] alert as possible. I want to speak on
[1:30:47] the s the secret of life. I will not get
[1:30:50] through it now but I will I want to
[1:30:53] introduce it at least on the secret of
[1:30:55] life. People today are very conscious
[1:30:57] about the life and the quality of life
[1:31:01] and uh and that's something that you
[1:31:03] hear quite frequently the quality of
[1:31:05] life. If you go to the hospital and you
[1:31:07] got a something serious, they want you
[1:31:09] to sign a document on uh uh do we revive
[1:31:14] you? If you do we resuscitate you or
[1:31:17] what happens and and then uh a question
[1:31:20] always comes up and I've been with
[1:31:22] people they they've asked me should I
[1:31:25] sign I said I can't really tell you that
[1:31:27] you do but then the question comes up
[1:31:30] what will be my quality of life if you
[1:31:32] resuscitate me. Well, I'll tell you
[1:31:35] what. God has had to resuscitate a
[1:31:38] world.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; We weren't only lost our breath. We lost
[1:31:43] our mind.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; This generation lost everything that was
[1:31:47] worthwhile.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; And God had to resuscitate us with a new
[1:31:52] creation
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; to give us a right quality of life. And
[1:31:56] so the Bible says, "So God created man."
[1:31:59] This is where it began. Be created man
[1:32:01] in his own image. in the image of God
[1:32:04] created he him. Male and female created
[1:32:06] he them. And God blessed them. And God
[1:32:08] said unto them, "Be fruitful, multiply,
[1:32:11] replenish the earth, and subdue it, and
[1:32:13] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[1:32:16] over the fowl of the air, and over every
[1:32:18] living thing that moveth upon the
[1:32:20] earth." and and in and chapter 2:7. And
[1:32:24] the Lord God formed man of the dust of
[1:32:27] the earth and breathed into his nostrils
[1:32:30] the breath of life and man became a
[1:32:33] living soul. The life of God transmitted
[1:32:37] transferred into his son Adam. And his
[1:32:41] son Adam was was the underpinning. This
[1:32:45] is the I I want you to catch this word
[1:32:47] please. the underpinning
[1:32:50] act of creation. It was the founding act
[1:32:54] of creation which is when God who's a
[1:32:57] God of fills all time and space. I don't
[1:33:01] expect you to comprehend these things. I
[1:33:04] just say it. God who fills all time and
[1:33:06] space which the prophet said and made
[1:33:09] his son God of the earth. Now, I don't
[1:33:12] know why God chose this this planet, but
[1:33:14] he chose this planet to put multiple
[1:33:17] billions of kinds of seeds of all kinds
[1:33:21] from grass and botney life to animal
[1:33:23] life to foul that flies in the air and
[1:33:26] all the things that are in the sea.
[1:33:28] Still discovering things thousands of
[1:33:30] feet deep in the sea and and and and
[1:33:33] there's all there's millions of species
[1:33:36] that are already extinct. And God, that
[1:33:38] was all in God's mind. And that's that
[1:33:41] isn't anything. It'll take eternity to
[1:33:44] to for us to keep discovering what's in
[1:33:46] God's mind. But then he breathed into
[1:33:48] Adam and Adam became a living soul. That
[1:33:51] was the life, the original life.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; That man had original life.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; And then the Bible and then I want to
[1:34:00] refer to that as the underpinning. The
[1:34:02] word underpinning is a solid foundation.
[1:34:06] It's a solid foundation which is laid
[1:34:09] below ground level to support or
[1:34:12] strengthen a building. So it's the
[1:34:14] underpinning. It was the commencement of
[1:34:17] a lineage.
[1:34:19] This is a foundation for a lineage.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; And Adam Adam was given that multiply
[1:34:28] and replenish.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; He was the founding father
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; to be the founding father of all of
[1:34:34] that. Then the Bible tells us of the
[1:34:38] fall.
[1:34:40] The f the the it tells us of the fall
[1:34:43] and and there therefore it says
[1:34:47] therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[1:34:50] from the garden of Eden to till the
[1:34:52] ground from whence he was taken. But the
[1:34:56] prophet says in Christ is the mystery of
[1:34:58] God revealed. And if you want to listen
[1:34:59] to a message, listen to that one in the
[1:35:02] next few days. God's secret mystery he
[1:35:06] had before the world began. Now back in
[1:35:09] the back part of God's mind, there was
[1:35:12] something that he was trying and was
[1:35:15] going to achieve.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; And he had a motive. He had a motive and
[1:35:22] he had a plan. In other words, he had a
[1:35:24] motive in doing it in order to let
[1:35:27] himself be expressed. So when God began
[1:35:30] to speak and God began to act, it was
[1:35:33] for one's purpose, this motive. I'm
[1:35:35] going to be expressed.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to That even comes down to
[1:35:38] today. We're here today. You're living
[1:35:41] your life. God gave you life so you
[1:35:43] could express him.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; That's why you're here in this world.
[1:35:47] You're here to express what God's
[1:35:50] original thought was.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Satan attacked the very
[1:35:55] foundation,
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; the underpinning. He he attacked the
[1:36:00] foundation. I want you to hold on to
[1:36:03] that. It was the foundation that he
[1:36:05] attacked uh the foundation of the
[1:36:08] creation. He couldn't create, but he
[1:36:11] could pervert what was created.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; And then God sent him forth out of the
[1:36:20] out of the garden. The Bible says he
[1:36:22] sent him forth to till the ground from
[1:36:25] whence he was taken. So in the fall, the
[1:36:28] original life was lost. Listen friends,
[1:36:32] every one of us, you've gone by uh uh
[1:36:36] you've gone by a cemetery and you see
[1:36:39] the gravestones, it's evidence something
[1:36:41] was lost. You drive by a hospital, it's
[1:36:44] evidence things was lost. And there's
[1:36:47] the the the criminal courts are full and
[1:36:49] backed up, incarcerated people by the
[1:36:52] multitudes. And the prophet of God, one
[1:36:55] man stands up and says when when when
[1:36:58] Eve and Adam fell, when Eve was deceived
[1:37:01] by that, missing that one word, he said
[1:37:04] it caused all of that
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; in one statement. It covers all of that.
[1:37:10] Let me say this. The quality of life,
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; even if you are in good health and you
[1:37:16] live out a good full life, the quality
[1:37:18] of life in this world is not a good
[1:37:21] quality of life,
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; we would say something's been lost. And
[1:37:26] when you see what people have to
[1:37:28] entertain themselves with, when you see
[1:37:30] what what people have to take to to try
[1:37:34] to maintain their health
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; and what they have to try to maintain
[1:37:38] their mental balance and and and if they
[1:37:41] got any little ache or emotional
[1:37:43] distress or whatever more, God made us.
[1:37:46] How many times the prophet of God I'm
[1:37:48] preaching to you now says that we he he
[1:37:51] says he wants us to be rugged.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Rugged young man.
[1:37:56] rugged young ladies.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Because it was the quality of life. And
[1:38:03] the prophet said, "And when he lost his
[1:38:06] life, when he lost his life, he also
[1:38:09] lost his inheritance in life." He lost
[1:38:12] his life. Oh my, how I thought that so
[1:38:15] touched me. Adam lost his life. But he
[1:38:18] lived on. He lived over 900 years. He
[1:38:22] lived on. What did he lose? He lost the
[1:38:24] quality. He lost the God life.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; He lost his way in life.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; And look how it's deteriorated ever
[1:38:31] since. And the prophet said, "Then how
[1:38:34] thankful I am for this message.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Our natural life here that we have is
[1:38:41] just a perversion.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; It really should have been the right
[1:38:46] life to begin with.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; But it's been perverted by natural
[1:38:50] birth.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; So you have a mother and a father. How
[1:38:54] thankful we could sing the other course.
[1:38:57] Brother Ryan and brother Kim, I have a
[1:38:59] father.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; It's not Charles Brham. It's not Fred
[1:39:04] Biscll. It's not your earthly father.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; You have a father.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; He knew my name.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:15] [Music]
[1:39:16] Thank God that he had
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; had us in his mind
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; and he said, "These are going to be my
[1:39:22] children."
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; And they've been born in a mess
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to bring the blood of
[1:39:27] Jesus Christ. I'm going to start a new
[1:39:29] creation and in the new creation it'll
[1:39:32] be perfection once again.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, people think that's a
[1:39:37] cultism when you talk about perfection
[1:39:39] and fre. I say what kind of religion
[1:39:41] does people have? something that's not
[1:39:44] going to bring them to perfection. Might
[1:39:45] as well forget it. Go out, drink, marry,
[1:39:47] and have a good time. But thank God we
[1:39:50] have a religion that brings us back. A
[1:39:53] word that brings us back to perfection
[1:39:56] once again. Life as it should be.
[1:40:00] [Music]
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; And phase three, I put this into three
[1:40:05] phases. The original life, the fallen
[1:40:08] life, and now the virgin life. And the
[1:40:11] virgin birth, he said, produce the
[1:40:12] product.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Produce the product. The
[1:40:17] virgin birth produced our kinsman
[1:40:19] redeemer. None other than the almighty
[1:40:22] God become Emmanuel. One of us,
[1:40:25] Emmanuel.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then Jesus came on the
[1:40:29] scene and he said, I am the way, the
[1:40:32] truth. I'm the life.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's back again.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:39] No man cometh unto the father by me. And
[1:40:42] in John 1 and4 it says in him was life.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; What kind of life? The life that Adam
[1:40:48] should have had in the first place. In
[1:40:51] him was life. And then in Revelation, he
[1:40:53] ends up in Revelation speaking to one of
[1:40:55] the church ages. He said, "I am he that
[1:40:58] liveth and was dead and behold, I'm
[1:41:01] alive forever more." In other words,
[1:41:03] he's telling us, "I tasted of life. I
[1:41:07] tasted of death,
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; but this is the life.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; I am he that was dead, and behold, I'm
[1:41:13] alive forever more. Amen. And I have the
[1:41:16] keys of death and hell.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; In the masterpiece, now at the harvest
[1:41:23] time, the seed is back to its original
[1:41:26] life. Back to the Bible, Malachi 4 said
[1:41:30] it would be brought that way. said, "Oh
[1:41:33] my, must have must have all to be this
[1:41:36] way. It must have all the word." And is
[1:41:39] that right? So, this is the secret
[1:41:42] mystery of the Bible.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Here's the secret mystery. We're going
[1:41:46] to turn a few sharp turns here in a few
[1:41:48] moments because I'm moving quickly. And
[1:41:50] if you want to ask me about anything
[1:41:53] afterwards, that's fine. Also, not
[1:41:54] today, but another time. This is the
[1:41:57] secret mystery of the entire Bible.
[1:42:01] That is why the seventh seal was his
[1:42:05] coming in silence. Because now I want to
[1:42:09] uh carry on from last Sunday and just
[1:42:11] remind you last Sunday we spoke of
[1:42:13] Joseph. We spoke of the Old Testament
[1:42:15] saints and and how the prophet now comes
[1:42:20] in our day and says it was Christ in
[1:42:22] Isaac.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; It was Christ in Joseph. It was Christ
[1:42:26] in Moses. It was Christ. Look at they
[1:42:30] didn't even realize it. It was Christ in
[1:42:32] Samuel when he was rejected. It was
[1:42:35] Christ in on David when David was being
[1:42:38] spit upon and dust was being thrown up
[1:42:41] in the air. It was Christ in him. And
[1:42:43] one of David's great men says, "I'll
[1:42:45] take that dog's head off."
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; David said, "No, don't do that. God had
[1:42:50] him do that." And he doesn't even know.
[1:42:53] So now the vision of the word of God,
[1:42:55] here it is. the vision in D. In Joseph's
[1:42:58] case, he's dreaming dreams, but he does
[1:43:01] he can't interpret the dream. His life
[1:43:04] interprets the dream, but he doesn't
[1:43:06] know it's being interpreted.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; He's having difficulty. He's having
[1:43:11] stress. He's having he's being torn from
[1:43:14] father and mother. He's been taken to a
[1:43:16] strange land. And the further he goes,
[1:43:19] the further he seems to be away from the
[1:43:21] fulfillment of God's plan. I want to say
[1:43:25] once again, I said a last Sunday. I want
[1:43:27] to say there's no elected
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; there's no elected son or daughter of
[1:43:31] God that that that God will allow to be
[1:43:34] taken outside of their ability to
[1:43:38] fulfill God's word in their life.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; God may take you from family. He may
[1:43:44] take you from friends. He may take you
[1:43:46] who knows where. You you may think I'm
[1:43:49] I'm the furthest away from fulfilling
[1:43:52] what God has for me. Don't worry.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; God who called you, God who brought you
[1:43:57] to this message, God is going to fulfill
[1:44:00] his purpose.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; And everyone who has fulfills God's
[1:44:04] purpose, he said, has a resurrection.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; That way you know you're in it.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; So the virgin birth produced it. And
[1:44:17] here came the one with the life.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I am he that alive and is
[1:44:22] alive forever more." And the prophet
[1:44:25] says, "Now at the harvest time,
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; the seed is back to its original life."
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; I would like you to be able to repeat
[1:44:34] that. At the harvest time, at the
[1:44:38] harvest time, the seed, if you can just
[1:44:41] say this with me, the seed is back to
[1:44:45] its original life.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand the harvest
[1:44:55] time. This is the harvest time
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; of the earth. What happens at harvest
[1:45:02] time?
[1:45:04] the grain is cut down
[1:45:08] at the harvest time.
[1:45:10] You're bringing in the seed.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; And that's what Jesus spoke about.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; And and at the harvest time, what went
[1:45:19] into the ground? Who went into the
[1:45:21] ground?
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; The original life went into the ground.
[1:45:27] But because he was greater than death,
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; he was greater than corruption.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Because he is the creator himself, he
[1:45:36] came back out of the grave and said, "I
[1:45:38] was dead, I'm alive."
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; And because I live, you shall live.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Well, what kind of quality of life? What
[1:45:46] kind of life is he giving us?
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; He's giving us some substandard life. I
[1:45:51] say, "No,
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; he's giving us original life." Amen.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; When did you ever hear of original life?
[1:45:58] When did you ever hear a message? The
[1:46:00] spoken word is the original seed
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; or the original seed is the spoken word.
[1:46:05] It's this messenger that spoke it. Why?
[1:46:08] Because God was going to put through his
[1:46:11] mouth
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; the the spoken word that would produce
[1:46:16] original life.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; And that is why the prophet speaks so
[1:46:20] much about the world. We don't need the
[1:46:22] entertainment. We don't need the world
[1:46:24] to support it. We don't need the joy and
[1:46:26] the world gifts. We don't need their fun
[1:46:29] and games. We don't need their fashions
[1:46:32] and all the We don't need that
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; because we have been we have been not
[1:46:36] only provided but we have been given
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Let me say it plain. We've been
[1:46:41] pregnantated.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; With the original seed.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:47] a virgin bride pregnant by the spoken
[1:46:51] word of God. And the spoken word of God
[1:46:54] can only say thus saith the Lord.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; So now that's why the seventh seal
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; could only come in silence.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; It's been silent all the time.
[1:47:15] the the fulfillment of the whole Old
[1:47:17] Testament.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; You read here of people's lives.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; You can read of of of the people that
[1:47:25] lived. You read about Noah and you read
[1:47:27] about him preaching 120 years. Then you
[1:47:30] hear read about him making an ark and
[1:47:32] you read about Abraham leaving. You read
[1:47:35] about and those are things we can relate
[1:47:37] to.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; He left his family. He left his friends.
[1:47:40] He left his comfort zone. Many here have
[1:47:43] done that. And we read about people who
[1:47:46] have gone into hardship with people
[1:47:48] who've been in famine. We've read about
[1:47:50] those that are widows. There's some that
[1:47:52] are widows here. There's widows in the
[1:47:54] Bible. They didn't know that they were
[1:47:58] portraying
[1:48:00] Jesus Christ.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was kept a secret. Why?
[1:48:06] Because it was telling of another life
[1:48:09] coming.
[1:48:12] It was telling of the coming of Christ.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; The first coming was coming in secret
[1:48:19] [Music]
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; and God held it as a secret and he held
[1:48:24] it in silence.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't tell anybody. He didn't have
[1:48:28] any special friend and say,
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; "Let me tell you something. This is the
[1:48:34] Messiah coming."
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; They didn't notice the Messiah coming.
[1:48:39] I'm portraying the Messiah.
[1:48:42] They're spitting on me, throwing dust in
[1:48:44] my face, and I'm portraying the Messiah.
[1:48:48] And here he's standing on the very hill
[1:48:50] that the son of David will stand on and
[1:48:53] have that very thing happen. How could
[1:48:55] he understand? He couldn't understand
[1:48:56] it. And that's why you can't understand
[1:48:59] this coming of Christ. But in the end
[1:49:02] time there had to be the original word
[1:49:05] come back because the original word was
[1:49:08] the underpinning
[1:49:10] of the foundation.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; And that is why this prophet goes to
[1:49:14] Zachchariah and speaks about Zerubbabel
[1:49:17] and he said and he that brought the
[1:49:20] foundation will also bring the
[1:49:23] headstone.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:30] He that built the foundation, he who
[1:49:33] underpinned it in the creation is going
[1:49:36] to also bring the tap stone.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; The capstone is Christ.
[1:49:42] [Applause]
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; I wished I had a couple of hours.
[1:49:49] And that is why the prophet said now
[1:49:52] when the seventh and the scripture reads
[1:49:54] and when the seventh seal was opened
[1:49:56] they were silent in heaven for about
[1:49:59] half an hour and that nothing is said is
[1:50:02] and the people were there expecting some
[1:50:04] great explosion of truth and that was
[1:50:08] and what they didn't realize is that
[1:50:10] they were fulfilling the word even by
[1:50:12] their presence sitting there listening.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Somebody had to hear it.
[1:50:20] Yes, sir.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; The mystery is how you are fulfilling a
[1:50:24] part of the word of God.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; And we're actually called on to fulfill
[1:50:29] the coming of Christ.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; You can't stop his coming
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; any more than any of them in the Old
[1:50:38] Testament could stop. Finally. Finally,
[1:50:41] he said the masterpiece arrived.
[1:50:46] There was nobody in the Old Testament
[1:50:48] realized when the masterpiece was
[1:50:51] coming.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God held it as his secret.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; And the mystery of it is how we as
[1:51:03] insignificant humans
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; could be made to play a part and ask
[1:51:08] that out.
[1:51:09] [Music]
[1:51:13] You are actually bringing
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; the whole thing to fulfillment
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; and that should be our joy.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; you mean that what I'm going through,
[1:51:25] the fact that you are standing here or
[1:51:27] sitting here and listening to this
[1:51:29] message and have gone through what
[1:51:30] you've gone through
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; in life.
[1:51:36] Some may be pulled from the dreads of
[1:51:39] sin,
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; from a terrible life in the world.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Others absolutely swallowed up in
[1:51:46] deception of religion.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Some here who perhaps, you know, kissed
[1:51:52] idols.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; You've been into this and into that and
[1:51:58] into some. It's been an absolute
[1:52:01] supernatural miracle that you're sitting
[1:52:04] here.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; And that's a fulfillment of God's word.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; I'll bring them from the north and the
[1:52:13] south.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; I'll bring them from the east and the
[1:52:16] west.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; here's what the original life said. All
[1:52:22] that the father hath given me shall
[1:52:25] come. Hallelujah.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Are you here?
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Are you part of that?
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Then you're fulfilling the very words of
[1:52:34] the Christ, the Messiah.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; I have come.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; In fact is I couldn't help it.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; And I can't give it up.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; It's not you. It's Christ. The spirit of
[1:52:47] God in you
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; that won't release his own word. He
[1:52:50] won't let go of it.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; It's not you holding it. It's holding
[1:52:55] you.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; All of these things come as such a
[1:52:59] miracle. Glory to God.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; I see you're in agreement, brother
[1:53:07] Michael. You know that that's the truth.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; So God had entrusted
[1:53:18] Adam with the secret of life.
[1:53:21] breathed into his nostrils as we said
[1:53:24] earlier and he lost his position and
[1:53:27] lost his ability to bring forth the
[1:53:29] image of God. He couldn't bring forth
[1:53:33] let us make man in our image then he was
[1:53:36] to bring forth the image but he couldn't
[1:53:38] do it.
[1:53:41] I'm not preaching you a sermon. I'm
[1:53:44] telling you, honored.
[1:53:48] There's a language brother Brandham
[1:53:49] used. The Exodus people,
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; honored people of the earth,
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; honored men and women of the earth,
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; and if you had Almighty God come down
[1:54:03] here, he couldn't say it any clearer.
[1:54:04] He's already said it. I'm going to use
[1:54:06] you
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; in all of your weakness,
[1:54:11] in all of the history that you have.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; I'm going to use you to bring forth my
[1:54:17] image
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; back on the earth.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; I have ordained. Some of you aren't
[1:54:23] aren't aren't quite there yet, but some
[1:54:25] God has simply said, I've ordained.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; What use is this planet? Why are
[1:54:31] scientists trying to discover the
[1:54:34] meaning of the planets and this place
[1:54:37] and trying to discover the origin of
[1:54:39] life and some big bang? I don't care if
[1:54:42] it's a big bang or what it was.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; If it was a big bang, God said bang.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Whatever it was, God did it.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; However small it is, God did it.
[1:54:56] And it takes a prophet who only went to
[1:54:58] grade seven to tell these men of all of
[1:55:01] this high class education. You're
[1:55:03] missing a period.
[1:55:06] [Applause]
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; They come home and said, "Oh, you said
[1:55:10] it's only 6,000 years old or 7,000 years
[1:55:14] old." That isn't what he said.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; That's what they figured out.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "In the beginning, God created
[1:55:20] the heaven and the earth."
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Period.
[1:55:24] and they go through 15 years of
[1:55:26] university and had can't find the
[1:55:28] period.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. That's exactly the way
[1:55:32] it is.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Whoever Whoever did it, God did it.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Could have been hundreds of millions of
[1:55:40] years. We We're not interested. We don't
[1:55:42] care. We're here.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; But the same God said,
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; "Christ in you
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; is the hope of glory
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; and is the mystery." What mystery? The
[1:55:53] mystery of the image coming back. The
[1:55:56] image of the original life coming back.
[1:55:59] You say, "Well, no, this is kind of over
[1:56:01] my no." No, it's not over your mind. You
[1:56:04] simply have to believe.
[1:56:06] And when you believe, you will activate
[1:56:09] the transforming power from within you.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Believe it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:56:16] Believe it. Say, "Well, I got this in my
[1:56:18] character. I got forget it.
[1:56:23] How long are you saved? He says, as long
[1:56:25] as you believe it.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I don't feel." Well, you
[1:56:31] don't feel it cuz you don't believe it.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; But once you believe it, you'll begin to
[1:56:35] feel it.
[1:56:36] [Applause]
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Say, "I got the devil on my case. I got
[1:56:40] the devil and he's saying this." Of
[1:56:42] course, he's saying that because you're
[1:56:44] stopping and listening to him
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; and you have enough time to tell all
[1:56:48] about it. the devil this and the devil
[1:56:50] that and my sickness this. And people
[1:56:52] can tell more about what the doctor
[1:56:54] said. They can tell about what God said.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Let's tell us what God said.
[1:57:00] God said God said, "I am the Lord that
[1:57:04] health thee."
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Say, "That's what I'm
[1:57:07] reading.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; That's the record."
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; You say, "You talk about a privileged
[1:57:15] people here. You have a prophet's
[1:57:18] message. Don't forget that prophet also
[1:57:20] stood in front of people and said you've
[1:57:22] been just to a doctor.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; I see you standing before a doctor.
[1:57:29] Actually, two doctors. They're kind of
[1:57:31] large men. Do you want me to tell you
[1:57:35] what what they wrote on their record?
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of doctor I want.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll tell you what they
[1:57:46] wrote and he tells them what's wrong
[1:57:48] with them
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; and tells them sometime when the doctor
[1:57:52] couldn't find it.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; The doctor couldn't find it. just
[1:57:56] listened to one while I was away and he
[1:57:57] says and I I've heard it several times
[1:58:00] and he talked to down in Phoenix and he
[1:58:02] says this woman oh this poor woman said
[1:58:06] you've had one two three four five
[1:58:11] operations
[1:58:13] and they couldn't find it cuz he said
[1:58:17] it's your nerves.
[1:58:20] Can you imagine the doctors have a
[1:58:22] person on the operating table, sheets
[1:58:24] all there, hand me a scalpel, hand me
[1:58:27] this, hand me the tweezers, all this
[1:58:28] stuff trying to find what's wrong with
[1:58:30] her,
[1:58:32] what she went through that poor.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; I tell the kind of physician I want is
[1:58:37] what speaks to a prophet.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Does this congregation believe it?
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; We believe it.
[1:58:47] Lord, help thou our unbelief.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Help me to believe it.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; so he said in the Christ the mystery.
[1:58:58] Now, I'll just take you. I wish I had it
[1:59:00] on the screen, but you'll just follow me
[1:59:02] for just a short little while. And God
[1:59:05] had a purpose.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Now, watch how this flows. Please watch
[1:59:09] how it flows very carefully. God had a
[1:59:12] purpose and a hidden mystery.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; And that's what I want. He's that's what
[1:59:17] I want to speak on to the church this
[1:59:20] morning.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; That's what he was speaking on. So, I'm
[1:59:23] just making some emphasis. He's speaking
[1:59:25] on the hidden mystery
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; of God that he had in his mind before
[1:59:32] the world ever began.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; So, you folks that read books,
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; read this one.
[1:59:40] say, "I'd love to find out what God had
[1:59:42] in his mind
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; before the world ever came
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; before the stars and the galaxies. I'd
[1:59:50] like to know what was in God's mind."
[1:59:52] And he goes on, "And how
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; it it has unfolded." What what
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; how what is it what was ever in God's
[2:00:01] mind?
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; How it has unfolded
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; itself. Right down. Scientists didn't
[2:00:07] unfold it. God unfolded it.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; It unfolded itself right down to this
[2:00:13] present hour that we're living in.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:00:20] [Music]
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; He says, "And then you will understand.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; You young people, you stay with this.
[2:00:31] Then you will understand
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; clearly.
[2:00:36] Then you see on I believe what is being
[2:00:40] done. You will understand what is being
[2:00:42] done.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Stay with it.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Don't get bogged down now. Don't get
[2:00:50] clouded. You don't have to get clouded.
[2:00:52] You don't have to get blurred.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Then you'll understand.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; He said if you stay with this, you'll
[2:00:58] understand
[2:01:00] what is being done. He said, now God's a
[2:01:03] great mystery. And I started out by
[2:01:05] saying the great mystery is the mystery
[2:01:07] of life.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Not life as we have it.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; God's life.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I'm 78. I'm not
[2:01:16] interested in human life.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; I don't care how long you live.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; If you get older, you get my age and
[2:01:25] older,
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; you'll say this isn't quality life.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; So I'll give you medication. You can you
[2:01:32] might have another three, four, five
[2:01:34] good years. What do you mean by good
[2:01:36] years?
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; You already know I don't hear all that
[2:01:46] well.
[2:01:50] And so I go searching to find out.
[2:01:52] You're looking at a person that love
[2:01:54] playing guitar.
[2:01:57] And and in playing guitar, I would sit
[2:02:00] for several hours a day and play chord
[2:02:03] progressions
[2:02:05] and the harmony between a ninth and a
[2:02:08] diminished and an augmented and to play
[2:02:11] these in the minors and the minor 7ths
[2:02:14] and so on. If it was supposed to have a
[2:02:16] minor 7th, you don't just play a minor.
[2:02:18] It doesn't sound right. and you just
[2:02:21] could play and and and sing and
[2:02:24] harmonize in quartet and trios. And when
[2:02:28] I didn't do so much, I just love to hear
[2:02:30] it. Now I don't love to hear it anymore.
[2:02:33] Say, "What did you change?" No, I can't
[2:02:36] hear it. Right.
[2:02:38] And that sounds garbled. And my home
[2:02:41] used to always have music. My wife
[2:02:42] doesn't play anymore music in the house
[2:02:45] cuz it's a bunch of noise to me. And so
[2:02:48] I'm trying to find out when will
[2:02:50] science. Well, why don't you pray for
[2:02:52] healing? I've done. Why don't you pray
[2:02:54] for me for healing?
[2:02:58] Anybody want to stand up and say, I'll
[2:02:59] give you your tone back. I say, praise
[2:03:01] the Lord. I'll hug you every day.
[2:03:07] But you lose little things.
[2:03:10] You lose little things. You lose. You
[2:03:13] can't Your hearing's gone, then your
[2:03:15] music is gone. then you can't remember
[2:03:18] quite. Oh, did I tell you that story?
[2:03:20] Yeah, you just told me this morning.
[2:03:23] No, I'm not there.
[2:03:29] But I've had people come up to say, "Did
[2:03:30] they ever did I ever tell you about it?"
[2:03:32] "Yeah, you told me about 40 times.
[2:03:36] Do you want me to tell that back to
[2:03:37] you?"
[2:03:39] No. But things go one after the other.
[2:03:42] memory goes and and then your taste goes
[2:03:45] and you know and so on your appetite may
[2:03:48] go. I wish it would,
[2:03:52] but things happen and you find out that,
[2:03:56] you know, it's it's it's lost. And now
[2:03:59] this is kind of serious. My father was
[2:04:01] taken down with a massive stroke,
[2:04:04] massive cerebral hemorrhage. And I I was
[2:04:07] I was he was going to help me on the
[2:04:08] house. Instead, I got called instead of
[2:04:11] him being at the house to help me. I'm
[2:04:13] in the Vancouver General Hospital in the
[2:04:15] emergency behind the curtains and seeing
[2:04:18] if they've shaved his head and I take
[2:04:21] him by the hand as real, you know, just
[2:04:25] his hand was warm and got my dad's hand
[2:04:28] and and he's totally unconscious
[2:04:32] breathing.
[2:04:37] A doctor finally comes in and says,
[2:04:40] "We have to find out what struck such
[2:04:43] apparently a strong man, 64 years old,
[2:04:47] 14 years younger than myself. And he and
[2:04:49] I looked like brothers." He didn't
[2:04:51] hardly have a gray hair in his head
[2:04:55] and I held his hand and I looked up and
[2:04:57] I said, "God,
[2:04:59] I don't know where dad is,
[2:05:03] but I can't speak. He can't speak.
[2:05:07] He can't see.
[2:05:10] I don't think he's hearing
[2:05:13] all of these. He can't feel me. I'm
[2:05:17] holding his hand. I don't know where he
[2:05:20] is.
[2:05:22] Maybe he's on a flight. Maybe he's
[2:05:24] starting now.
[2:05:27] You know, you have visited people that
[2:05:30] have I visited Brother Edwin Dodd.
[2:05:33] Sister Sally is here. She was there.
[2:05:37] And to see a man that can't eat,
[2:05:43] he understands. I don't know if he sees
[2:05:45] that well anymore.
[2:05:47] Don't know how he can identify things.
[2:05:51] He can't speak.
[2:05:53] All this is gone. That's not the life
[2:05:58] that God gave him. Right.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; God allowed him to be here on this earth
[2:06:04] and he had a profound witness.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; And there's one man that was not ashamed
[2:06:10] of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; He was not ashamed of this message. And
[2:06:15] he would speak about it not only at
[2:06:17] every open door, he would open a door to
[2:06:19] speak about it.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of man he was. So
[2:06:25] friends,
[2:06:26] I speak to you as friends. As I speak to
[2:06:28] you as children, I speak to you as a
[2:06:31] brother who loves you.
[2:06:34] Do not let this life consume you and
[2:06:38] your time and your energy and all that
[2:06:41] you are. Do not allow this life to
[2:06:45] simply be your achievement.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; Do not do it. It's a huge mistake. Cuz
[2:06:51] one day then you wake up
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; young ladies and the beauty is gone and
[2:06:56] the strength of youth is gone and all
[2:06:59] that freshness and the sparkle of the
[2:07:00] eye is gone.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; And then what
[2:07:07] I want to say to this congregation, we
[2:07:10] want to cross over
[2:07:13] and we want to meet that one that
[2:07:15] brought the original life.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; We want to meet this prophet messenger.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Can I go on just a little bit
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; now? Just so I want to bring you right
[2:07:28] back please quickly. He says then you'll
[2:07:31] understand clearly then you see on I
[2:07:34] believe what is being done right after
[2:07:36] that what is being done he says God's
[2:07:40] great mystery of how it's a secret.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; He kept it a secret. Nobody knew
[2:07:49] anything about it. Then he drops right
[2:07:51] down into the Bible language.
[2:07:54] Even the angels
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; didn't understand it.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; See, he didn't reveal it. That's the
[2:08:01] reason
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; under the seventh mystery
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; when the seventh seal was opened.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; There was silence.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; That's the reason there was silence is
[2:08:12] because he didn't reveal it. He didn't
[2:08:14] make it known. He was keeping the coming
[2:08:17] a mystery. Right.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; And we do not know precisely when
[2:08:25] physically the we may see the Lord
[2:08:27] again. Don't expect to see the Lord
[2:08:30] Jesus in this dimension.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; He came to get you to take you to his
[2:08:35] dimension.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; He has come.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; That's who called you. Amen.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Wasn't William Brandon who called you.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; It was the original life
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; calling you.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; That's who called you into this message.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a servant's voice. It was the
[2:09:02] bridegroom's voice
[2:09:04] that you heard.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; You already have heard it, but you might
[2:09:08] say, "Well, I didn't realize it." You
[2:09:10] don't have to realize it. What you
[2:09:12] needed to do was to respond to it.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Did you feel something? Did you sense
[2:09:17] something? Yes, I did. I sense something
[2:09:20] very sacred. I sense something very
[2:09:22] holy. I sense something that I couldn't
[2:09:25] resist. That's because you were made to
[2:09:28] marry him.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; You were made to be his bride.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm not trying to preach. I'm
[2:09:35] trying to tell you the truth.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "But I heard somebody
[2:09:41] preach." It was Christ in him
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; preaching to you.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; It was Christ in his body
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; calling to you.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; And then when you realize it's not a
[2:09:59] preacher,
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; it's not an evangelist,
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; it's not your neighbor,
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; but it's actually Jesus Christ.
[2:10:09] That's the mystery.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; That's the secret.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; And I can show you all through the
[2:10:18] scripture where people missed the
[2:10:20] secret.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; And there were others who didn't know
[2:10:25] the secret, but they just went on in the
[2:10:28] direction. They were just godly people
[2:10:31] of integrity. Believed in God, Jehovah
[2:10:34] of the Old Testament. We believe in
[2:10:36] Jesus of the New. And that messenger, a
[2:10:40] prophet, God sent a prophet to tell you
[2:10:42] that Jehovah the Old Testament is Jesus
[2:10:46] of the New.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; And this Jesus talking to you. Amen.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; He says Jesus when he was on earth. Now
[2:11:07] he goes back to when Jesus was on earth.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; He said they wanted to know.
[2:11:14] They wanted to know when he would come.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Now imagine he was right there. But they
[2:11:22] want to know when he would come because
[2:11:24] he said when the son of man cometh and
[2:11:26] they're trying to figure it out. When
[2:11:27] are you going to come?
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; He said that's a secret.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; And here they were actually living it
[2:11:35] out themselves.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; Because they're just like you and me.
[2:11:41] They were asking the same questions you
[2:11:43] asked. When's he going to come?
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Hello, folks.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; Wake up. You're part of the coming.
[2:11:53] You say, "I'm stretching it." Not a bit.
[2:11:55] I I wish I could emphasize it more.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to take it just a little
[2:12:02] bit further. Watch. Watch closely. It
[2:12:04] will help you the next time you read
[2:12:06] this. And I hope it'll very soon. Christ
[2:12:09] the mystery of God revealed. Watch how
[2:12:11] it goes. That's why you have to go very
[2:12:13] slowly. He says, "And they want to know
[2:12:16] when he would come." And he said, "It's
[2:12:17] not." And then he said, and you read
[2:12:20] this in the Bible, and as soon as I say
[2:12:22] it, I want you to raise your hand if you
[2:12:24] read it. Said, even the son doesn't
[2:12:26] know.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Did you read that?
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; Even he didn't know.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Even the son himself doesn't know when
[2:12:36] it's going to happen. See, God has this
[2:12:39] all to himself.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; It's a secret. And that's the reason
[2:12:47] there was silence in heaven for the
[2:12:50] That's the reason Revelation 8:1. That's
[2:12:53] the reason there was silence in heaven
[2:12:56] for half an hour
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; and seven thunders. Now he carries on
[2:13:01] and seven thunders uttered their voices
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; and John was even forbidden to write it.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; See the coming
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; of the Lord. Amen.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; So something that the thunders and and
[2:13:17] brother Brandham says what the thunders
[2:13:19] are. The thunders he said it's God's
[2:13:21] voice.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; It's no great spooky thing.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; It's God's voice.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; And God thunders out. And he's, brother
[2:13:32] Brown said another place he said that's
[2:13:34] what Jeffersonville needs is is
[2:13:36] thousands more uh voices
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; thundering out
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; this word.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; And he said and that's one thing he
[2:13:47] hasn't revealed yet of how he will come
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; and when he will come. And he said it's
[2:13:53] a good thing that he doesn't. No. And
[2:13:56] then he goes on he says he has showed
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; or revealed it. in every type that's in
[2:14:03] the Bible.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; So, every type he's revealed, every type
[2:14:08] in the Bible tells what it is,
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; tells of the coming and how he comes.
[2:14:14] And that is the secret coming. And I'm
[2:14:17] telling you now this morning, I can go
[2:14:18] right back to Genesis all the way
[2:14:20] through to the New Testament and show
[2:14:22] that the men that were used of God in
[2:14:25] his first coming, actually, they were
[2:14:28] part of the coming. They were they were
[2:14:30] part they were typifying what the actual
[2:14:34] masterpiece was going to be
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; and they didn't know they didn't
[2:14:38] understand why why they were uh their
[2:14:42] friends became enemies. They didn't
[2:14:44] realize why they were cast out. They
[2:14:46] didn't realize why some hated them.
[2:14:48] David didn't understand why perhaps he
[2:14:51] didn't understand fully why why Saul
[2:14:54] hated him.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Didn't understand it. Amen.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Jacob works for Laban and he says, "You
[2:15:02] changed my wages 10 times."
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; It's in the Bible.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; You know, God has a strange way of doing
[2:15:11] things.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you,
[2:15:15] when you think you're going backward,
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; God has strange ways of blessing his
[2:15:20] people.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Some people say, "I I can't afford to
[2:15:24] give." Let me just tell you from
[2:15:26] experience, you just try giving
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; and I guarantee you, you'll never
[2:15:30] outgive God.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; He'll figure ways for things to happen.
[2:15:35] I I had a family come in here some years
[2:15:37] ago and they said, "You know what,
[2:15:39] Brother Bisc?" He said, "We've got all
[2:15:41] of our
[2:15:42] we've got all of our budget down
[2:15:46] and and there's nothing to give. There's
[2:15:49] no way we can tithe." And yet we see
[2:15:52] that it's our duty to tithe and the
[2:15:54] tithing actually belongs to God. It's
[2:15:56] already his. Said, "Well, that's right."
[2:16:00] And they went out of that. I didn't give
[2:16:01] them a whole lot of counsel. I I like
[2:16:03] people to come to their own own
[2:16:05] confession and conviction. They say,
[2:16:06] "You know what? That's what God said and
[2:16:08] that's what we're going to do." About 2,
[2:16:11] three months down the road, they wanted
[2:16:13] to meet with me. They said, "This
[2:16:15] doesn't even make sense."
[2:16:18] He says, "Our expenses are still the
[2:16:20] same. We started tithing and when we get
[2:16:23] to the end of the month, we still got
[2:16:25] some left over." I said, "Well, don't
[2:16:28] ask me.
[2:16:30] Don't ask me how to do it.
[2:16:33] My wife, she's not a shopper. You know,
[2:16:35] she'll be happy I made this statement to
[2:16:37] the whole world here. My wife's not a
[2:16:39] shopper, but she needs something, she'll
[2:16:41] go in and she likes a certain department
[2:16:44] store, which I won't give them a plug.
[2:16:48] But she goes on there and they and she
[2:16:51] gets a nice lady and the lady says, "Oh,
[2:16:53] this is already on sale. You know, this
[2:16:55] is already on sale." Oh, this is already
[2:16:57] half price. Oh, well that's nice. And
[2:16:59] not only that, we're giving another 20%
[2:17:01] off today because this is a certain day.
[2:17:04] We're giving another 25% or 20% off. Oh,
[2:17:07] well that's great. And she sees her
[2:17:09] white hair says, "I see that you're a
[2:17:10] senior. We give you another 15% because
[2:17:13] you're a senior." And by the way, do you
[2:17:14] have one of our cards? Yeah, I have
[2:17:16] another Yeah, I have one of your cards.
[2:17:19] It's in my purse. Oh, don't worry about
[2:17:20] it. We'll give you another 20% off. And
[2:17:22] by the time she got off there, they
[2:17:24] almost owed her money for shopping.
[2:17:28] Says, "I got this thing. I only paid
[2:17:30] about $15 for it instead of maybe a
[2:17:33] hundred."
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; Who did it?
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; You know what I say? I don't say, "Well,
[2:17:38] blessed be you, Sister Ruth Biscll." No,
[2:17:41] I say, "Praise the Lord."
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He knows how to do it.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not just telling you a story. I'm
[2:17:52] telling you that's right. That's right.
[2:17:56] And so he said, and I'm closing right
[2:17:58] away. He said they showed it and
[2:18:00] revealed it in every type that's in the
[2:18:02] Bible. Therefore, the entire Bible is
[2:18:06] the revelation of God's mystery in
[2:18:08] Christ. And he goes, "Hm."
[2:18:12] The entire Bible is an expression of one
[2:18:14] goal. One goal, not two, three, not to
[2:18:17] make a bunch of sermon. It's the
[2:18:19] expression of one goal
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; that God had, one purpose that he wanted
[2:18:26] to achieve in the entire Bible. And all
[2:18:29] the acts of believers in the Bible has
[2:18:34] been in type and expressing what God's
[2:18:37] great goal is. And now
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; in the last day,
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; he has revealed it and shows it.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; And God's help, well, he said, you'll
[2:18:55] see it right here this morning. Amen.
[2:18:58] Hallelujah.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; What the Lord has had in his mind all
[2:19:12] along and has expressed it.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; Therefore, you can see the great meaning
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; of what it's been to know this. Now,
[2:19:23] he's talking about himself. You can see
[2:19:25] the great meaning of what it's been to
[2:19:27] know this
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; and then to know what
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; and then to try to bring it to the
[2:19:35] people and to try to bring it to the
[2:19:37] people
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; and then he said you don't he said I
[2:19:41] haven't gone into the depths to try to
[2:19:44] explain it the way God has revealed it
[2:19:46] to me
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; and then he goes right into this Luke 24
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; chapter 2 apostles apostles are on the
[2:19:55] road to Damascus. What's he talking
[2:19:58] about? The great secret of Christ
[2:20:00] coming.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; And now he was there with the secret
[2:20:04] made known which the prophet said this
[2:20:06] great secret was life after death.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; He said the seal was tore off. The
[2:20:12] Easter seal was tore off. And now for
[2:20:15] the first time and he's not preaching to
[2:20:17] thousands. He preached to thousands who
[2:20:19] didn't believe it. He's preaching to two
[2:20:22] disciples to tell them and knowing that
[2:20:25] it will spread to the others and he
[2:20:27] showed himself to the angel showed
[2:20:29] themselves to the ladies. But now here's
[2:20:31] Christ and the Bible says and I preached
[2:20:33] on it and please understand it. Christ
[2:20:36] himself
[2:20:38] [Applause]
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; stepped onto the pathway
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; and walked with them
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; and oh they had a mighty revelation and
[2:20:47] they were just jumping and skipping. No,
[2:20:49] they were sad.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; They were sad about life.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; They were sad about the demise of their
[2:20:57] church.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; Their secretary, their treasure just
[2:21:01] hung himself
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; and committed suicide and their leader
[2:21:07] just died on the cross. And somebody
[2:21:09] said they stole his body and all of
[2:21:11] these things. And ladies from the
[2:21:13] church, we don't know. We can't have a
[2:21:15] hard time believing them. They went
[2:21:17] there and they saw some men in white
[2:21:19] garments and this whole thing has gone
[2:21:21] so spooky
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; and we don't know where he is.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; And now that he he he he he was in the
[2:21:29] tomb and now he's not in the tomb and
[2:21:32] we're hearing stories and we don't know
[2:21:34] and they're reasoning amongst themselves
[2:21:37] and Christ himself
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; to say something that I'm going to ask
[2:21:41] you. What do you say?
[2:21:45] Hallelujah.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; What do you see where we're at
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; after a prophet has said it so clearly?
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; And you'll see, you should be able to
[2:21:55] read that message and see what the
[2:21:57] purpose was of his entire ministry.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; One of the greatest messages you can
[2:22:03] read. Christ is the mystery of God
[2:22:06] revealed. And the mystery of God is I
[2:22:09] put in the in the in the beginning I put
[2:22:12] my life on that earth
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; in a man
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; and his wife and he fell
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; and life was gone.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; But I have already determined I'll
[2:22:25] redeem it
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to bring it back
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; to its original position.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; That's the whole story of the Bible. And
[2:22:34] to prove it, I brought myself the new
[2:22:36] creation, the beginning of another
[2:22:40] creation. And he walked on the earth.
[2:22:42] And here the two. And brother Brandham
[2:22:44] is in that same he's on the same
[2:22:46] subject, the coming of the Lord. And now
[2:22:48] the Lord had come as a masterpiece. And
[2:22:51] he healed the sick, done all these ma
[2:22:54] man uh
[2:22:56] marvelous things. And then he's he's
[2:22:59] killed. And he goes to the grave. And
[2:23:01] now it's after the grave because when he
[2:23:03] was here on earth that wasn't fully the
[2:23:06] restored life
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; because that life had died and Jesus
[2:23:12] died.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; He actually gasped his last breath and
[2:23:16] died. So the life before Jesus died
[2:23:20] wasn't fully expressed the life of God.
[2:23:22] The life of God was when he took control
[2:23:26] of death.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:30] and came out of the tomb with the keys
[2:23:34] of death, hell, and the grave and
[2:23:37] defeated Satan. Not for him, for you.
[2:23:42] [Music]
[2:23:43] For you and I.
[2:23:46] Hallelujah.
[2:23:48] And back said, "It's over, children.
[2:23:51] Because I live,
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; you shall live also."
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of life.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:59] Life is stronger than death.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:24:07] [Applause]
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; So he wanted his two saddened disciples.
[2:24:16] He said, "Are you a stranger?"
[2:24:18] I've said it before. I say it again.
[2:24:22] Two believers,
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; could have been out of this church,
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; are looking at the word in flesh
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; in another dimension.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; They're looking at a body that will
[2:24:34] never die again.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; And they're asking the fulfilled word.
[2:24:42] Are you a stranger?
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; He was a stranger to them.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; Are you a stranger?
[2:24:51] And the stranger had to start
[2:24:53] explaining.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; And where did he go? To the scripture.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; It's already written.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; It's already been preached on. You heard
[2:25:03] it in the synagogue. You heard it from
[2:25:06] your parents. It's the same word.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; It's nothing new. It's the same word.
[2:25:16] [Music]
[2:25:20] And all they had to do was believe it.
[2:25:23] And the big great mystery was right
[2:25:25] while they were walking was part of the
[2:25:28] scripture they were actually walking in
[2:25:31] a mystery themselves.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; And I don't know when they discovered
[2:25:39] when Cifa said to his friend, "You know
[2:25:40] what? That was us.
[2:25:44] That was us. We actually walked there
[2:25:47] and we were talking to the son of God
[2:25:50] raised out of the tomb. And it said so
[2:25:53] in the Bible, but we didn't even
[2:25:55] understand it. It was a secret mystery.
[2:25:59] [Applause]
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; So where do we go from here, brother
[2:26:06] Bisco? Well, perhaps I'll come back to
[2:26:09] some of it later on, but I just say you
[2:26:12] just keep living
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; godly.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; And you put God first.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; This is what Brother Brennan said. Just
[2:26:19] be real Christians.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; Just be real Christians.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; Just keep living it,
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; you're going to get there.
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; You're going to get there, kids.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; You're going to get there. Amen.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; You see, you're looking at brother Ed,
[2:26:32] his white hair, and I'm looking at you,
[2:26:36] nice young, strong.
[2:26:40] You can just twist and turn and jump.
[2:26:42] And I say, I look at you kids, I think,
[2:26:44] I wish I could do that.
[2:26:47] And they get on those skateboards and
[2:26:49] their balance is just so wonderful. I
[2:26:52] thought, man, I wished I had balance
[2:26:53] like that. But that balance kind of took
[2:26:56] wings and flew away. But brother Ed has
[2:27:00] some things I wish you had.
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; I've lived a long time, lived a lot of
[2:27:05] experience, and maybe you're not
[2:27:07] thinking what I'm thinking right now.
[2:27:08] You could be 18 or 20 years old in just
[2:27:10] a second
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; and I'd be the same age and we say,
[2:27:17] "Father Ed, you haven't got any more no
[2:27:19] white." No, there's no white hair over
[2:27:20] here.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; And you're not just a little boy
[2:27:25] anymore. You're up here.
[2:27:28] But there's something else. Brother Beam
[2:27:31] said they came by millions
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; and they hugged him.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; Why did they hug him? Cuz they knew
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; that he had brought a message to them.
[2:27:44] [Music]
[2:27:47] [Applause]
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; There was all kinds of people around
[2:27:51] when the maniac and the gatherings. The
[2:27:53] maniac was screaming and fierce and
[2:27:56] people were afraid to touch him and and
[2:27:59] he was living in the tombs and and and
[2:28:02] Jesus was there. You know who knew
[2:28:03] Jesus? The devils that were in that man
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; and they knew what the program was. They
[2:28:10] said, "Have you come to torment us
[2:28:12] before our time?"
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; And he cast them out.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? Amen.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, the interpretation
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; of his word, his life
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; Let's stand because there's no place to
[2:28:34] stop. Hallelujah.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; Tonight, Brother
[2:28:43] Tim Dodd is going to come. We're giving
[2:28:45] Brother Tom a holiday of rest.
[2:28:48] so he can get loaded for bear or loaded
[2:28:52] for whatever.
[2:28:55] He's been working hard and and they've
[2:28:58] done film on on the translation of the
[2:29:01] Bible. You know what, folks? I'm so
[2:29:04] happy
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; that God has allowed me to live to see
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; these things happening.
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; So happy of the prospects that maybe we
[2:29:15] can be instrumental. Amen.
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; And getting people
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; just imagine some black people
[2:29:24] sit way off in some jungle place where
[2:29:26] you can't even reach them and they
[2:29:29] somehow got a phone in their hand and
[2:29:32] now now they don't have to listen to the
[2:29:34] Catholic church but they can hear the
[2:29:37] prophets
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; message in Swahili
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; and and we we've made steps in that
[2:29:44] direction. We haven't sent anything to
[2:29:45] you, but we made steps already in that
[2:29:48] direction. And part of the program of
[2:29:49] these brothers going over, brother Dodd
[2:29:52] and Brother Dingwall. Part of it is
[2:29:54] they're going to research and look out
[2:29:56] what is the best way to minister to
[2:29:58] those people. Now you know what to pray
[2:30:00] about.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; God, just open up the channel. Remember,
[2:30:05] there's going to be hordes of devils.
[2:30:06] They're stopping. The devils don't want
[2:30:08] these people to hear it. But God God's
[2:30:10] Holy Spirit is going to open a door. I
[2:30:13] believe that he's going to open a door.
[2:30:14] He's going to blast a door open. Oh,
[2:30:17] praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[2:30:20] Hallelujah. It's so real. Thank God.
[2:30:23] Thank God I'm free. Free. Free from this
[2:30:26] world of sin.
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; And I hope you'll rejoice in it. Are you
[2:30:31] happy?
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Praise the Lord. Praise
[2:30:37] the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:30:44] Thank God I am free. Free. Free from
[2:30:49] this world of sin.
[2:30:52] Hallelujah.
[2:30:53] Lost in the blood of Jesus. Been born
[2:30:58] again.
[2:31:00] Oh hallelujah. I'm save
[2:31:05] my father.
[2:31:10] I'm sad. I found out he could bring me
[2:31:14] up
[2:31:16] away
[2:31:17] [Music]
[2:31:19] for a long time. I fell
[2:31:23] down.
[2:31:28] My heart was so heavy in sin. I sang
[2:31:35] that heard about Jesus.
[2:31:37] [Music]
[2:31:39] What a wonderful hour.
[2:31:43] I'm so glad that I found out
[2:31:47] me.
[2:31:52] Oh, thank God I am free
[2:31:57] from this world of sin.
[2:32:01] I'm washing the blood of Jesus been born
[2:32:06] again.
[2:32:09] Hallelujah. I'm saved
[2:32:13] save by wonderful grace.
[2:32:18] And I'm so glad that I found a reason to
[2:32:21] bring me
[2:32:24] away.
[2:32:25] [Music]
[2:32:28] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; I just want to sing some praise to him
[2:32:35] as we going to close in just a moment.
[2:32:37] But I just feel like worshiping him.
[2:32:41] What is that chorus we sing? I hear
[2:32:42] brother brother Mike, you sing it. Uh
[2:32:46] about u you didn't have to show me.
[2:32:52] Yeah. Right. We love that message.
[2:32:59] You open my eyes.
[2:33:02] You could have easily passed me by.
[2:33:07] For the age I was living in was wretched
[2:33:12] and poor and wise.
[2:33:17] May I hurt recognizing your name.
[2:33:21] serpent seed and perfect fra.
[2:33:26] [Music]
[2:33:30] Lord, I thank you.
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, we do.
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; And I just want to thank you, Lord,
[2:33:40] for letting me hear your word.
[2:33:45] What have I done to deserve such glory
[2:33:50] revealed in me?
[2:33:54] And thanks for that special night.
[2:33:59] When I saw your glorious life, came face
[2:34:04] to face with eternal life. Oh, I thank
[2:34:10] you.
[2:34:12] Came face to face with
[2:34:15] eternal life
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; came face to face with the original
[2:34:20] life.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; The prophet in his preaching speaks of
[2:34:25] different ones in the scripture talks
[2:34:27] about the rich ruler and he said he
[2:34:29] turned down eternal life.
[2:34:34] What grace is this
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; that God brought you to eternal life?
[2:34:41] I not even in my wildest dream
[2:34:46] did I dream and see Jesus
[2:34:51] as the coming of the Lord the rapture
[2:34:56] mystery
[2:34:58] hope it's real to you
[2:35:02] but now I see yes
[2:35:06] simplicity
[2:35:08] hallelujah
[2:35:10] word is the original.
[2:35:14] Lord, I thank you.
[2:35:17] [Music]
[2:35:19] I just want to thank you, Lord,
[2:35:23] for letting me hear your word.
[2:35:28] What have I done?
[2:35:32] Such glory revealed in me.
[2:35:37] Thanks for thousand.
[2:35:40] [Music]
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, perhaps it wasn't a special night,
[2:36:01] but it might be a special morning.
[2:36:04] Perhaps I pray, oh God, that perhaps
[2:36:06] even this morning. There's been
[2:36:08] something said that the Holy Spirit has
[2:36:11] been able to take to the heart and
[2:36:12] punctuate it and telling the people,
[2:36:15] telling perhaps some individual, look on
[2:36:17] this. Look on this. You don't have to
[2:36:20] have some great revelation, but look on
[2:36:21] this. And by looking on this, and we
[2:36:24] keep looking on it, it keeps unfolding
[2:36:26] and unfolding and unfolding down to this
[2:36:29] very hour that we're in. Oh God, thank
[2:36:32] you for this blessed message. Thank you
[2:36:34] for the faithful messenger. Oh God, we
[2:36:37] thank you father that you so vindicated,
[2:36:40] proved it. You stood behind it. You gave
[2:36:43] the evidence of it, Lord. And now here
[2:36:45] we are as the evidence of the truth of
[2:36:48] your word. You've given power, oh God,
[2:36:51] to these young people. How thankful we
[2:36:53] are for these young women. Even the
[2:36:55] children, oh God, you've given power to
[2:36:57] them. they sit and listen with reverence
[2:36:59] to the word as it's preached. I pray
[2:37:01] it'll just be such a reality to them.
[2:37:04] Give each one of each one that is here
[2:37:06] today. Just give them a blessed joy in
[2:37:08] their heart. Give them joy unspeakable
[2:37:10] and full of glory. I pray, oh God, they
[2:37:13] will laugh in the devil's face that
[2:37:15] there's nothing that can conquer them.
[2:37:18] Even death itself has become helpless
[2:37:20] before your children. ask you Lord Jesus
[2:37:23] that you'll bless us as we prepare and
[2:37:25] have have a little time of refreshment
[2:37:27] and come this evening to hear what you
[2:37:30] have laid on our brother Tim Dodd's
[2:37:31] heart. Father I pray you'll give rest
[2:37:34] and refreshment to brother Tom and
[2:37:36] strengthen him. Watch over brother
[2:37:37] Murphy, oh God, and brother Michael as
[2:37:40] they're finishing this work there. And
[2:37:42] may they come home uh soon. And I pray
[2:37:45] Lord you will bless brother John as he
[2:37:47] prepares for soon uh these meetings in
[2:37:50] in uh Poland. And Lord we just ask that
[2:37:53] you'll send a word with a mighty voice.
[2:37:56] Bless our brother Kyle today. Oh God,
[2:37:58] brother Peter Ivan an ankle. Father
[2:38:00] bless the work in Seattle Tacoma. Bless
[2:38:03] the work in Victoria. I pray in the name
[2:38:06] of Jesus.
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. And Lord, this
[2:38:10] week we will send this uh group of
[2:38:12] people like a mighty army
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; to Uganda and you'll prepare the way
[2:38:18] ahead of them, Father. Oh God, you'll
[2:38:22] make it such a blessing. And to us in
[2:38:24] Switzerland, I'm so anticipating and the
[2:38:27] saints there. I pray, Father, that it'll
[2:38:30] be a mighty move of your spirit upon
[2:38:33] each one as the choir sang today. Bless
[2:38:36] them, I pray. Bless our school, oh God.
[2:38:39] Bless the teaching staff and the
[2:38:41] principal. Father, each one of them, oh
[2:38:43] God. Bless, I pray, our Sunday school
[2:38:46] teachers and our brother Richard Drake,
[2:38:48] Father, the deacons, oh God, and the
[2:38:51] trustees, Lord.
