[7:24] just come and lead us in prayer this
[7:27] morning. We want to remember the uncle
[7:31] of Sister Patricia.
[7:33] Briner this morning has just been
[7:36] diagnosed with inoperable cancer. Is
[7:39] only months to live. Please pray for
[7:41] God's will, healing, and the saving of
[7:44] his soul. Amen. I'm sure there's many
[7:46] unspoken requests here this morning,
[7:49] family members represented that aren't
[7:51] here. My wife is at home, uh, sick and
[7:54] body, but knowing that the Lord is
[7:55] gracious to extend his healing touch in
[7:58] our family, and just trust that each one
[8:01] will receive the portion of the word
[8:03] this morning in our lives. Brother
[8:04] Darren, would you come?
[8:07] [Music]
[8:15] Heavenly Father, we are so thankful,
[8:17] Lord Jesus, to approach you this
[8:18] morning. As the word says, as the as you
[8:21] see the end approach, Lord, to gather
[8:23] yourselves so much more together.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to just say thank you for
[8:27] these opportunities, Lord. Thank you for
[8:30] these times of refreshing for our souls
[8:33] that we can come and drink from that
[8:35] fountain, Lord, that shall never run
[8:37] dry. that we can feast at the master's
[8:40] table, Lord God. Well, we'll never grow
[8:42] hungry, Lord. Lord Jesus, you have a
[8:45] bountiful storehouse open for us, Lord
[8:48] Jesus, to receive this morning. No
[8:50] matter what it is that we have need of,
[8:52] dear God, you're our provider. You're
[8:55] the one who gives us strength. You're
[8:56] the one who releases us, oh God, from
[8:58] all bondage, from all our trials, all
[9:00] our complexes. Lord Jesus, you're the
[9:03] one that gives eternal life. Dear God,
[9:05] you're the one that brings healing to
[9:07] our bodies, dear Lord Jesus. All we have
[9:10] need of, dear God, your hand supplies
[9:12] it, Lord God. And tonight, Lord Jesus,
[9:15] or this morning, we're asking, dear God,
[9:17] that you would meet with us in a
[9:18] personal way, Lord God. Not just on our
[9:21] flesh realm, oh God. Not just our spirit
[9:24] realm, but the inside of the inside,
[9:26] dear God, that you would speak to our
[9:28] hearts, Lord, each one of us, Father,
[9:31] that we have would have an impersonal
[9:33] encounter with Jesus Christ this
[9:34] morning. We're not here to meet with
[9:37] each other, dear God. We're here to meet
[9:39] with you. We're here to experience your
[9:41] presence, experience, Lord God, your
[9:44] touch, Lord God, that we can commune,
[9:46] Lord Jesus, with you. Lord, we pray that
[9:49] we would have ears to hear and hearts to
[9:51] receive. Lord, that faith would be
[9:54] quickened this morning, no matter what
[9:56] our needs are, dear God, for we are a
[9:58] needy people, Lord, whether we who are
[10:01] gathered here this morning, those on the
[10:03] internet, Lord, those that may hear this
[10:05] service by the way, the archives, Lord.
[10:08] Heavenly Father, we're praying that our
[10:10] faith would just rise up, Lord, to to
[10:12] meet the occasion, Lord Jesus, that we
[10:14] have need of to claim the promises of
[10:16] God, to apprehend it, Lord God, to
[10:18] embrace it, Lord, not to let go until
[10:21] you touch us, Lord, till we walk
[10:23] differently, Lord God, that we're no
[10:25] longer the same, Lord Jesus. Those that
[10:28] are in financial difficulty, Lord, this
[10:30] is such an hour of financial upheaval,
[10:32] dear God, and we just want to be able to
[10:34] provide for our families, Lord Jesus. We
[10:37] want to be faithful stewards, dear God,
[10:39] to put bread upon the table, dear Lord,
[10:41] to pay our bills, Lord, knowing that
[10:43] you're faithful, Lord God, to meet our
[10:45] needs, that you'd not see your children
[10:47] baking bread. Lord, for those that need
[10:50] physical healing, Lord. Lord, our sister
[10:52] Patricia, her uncle, Lord, being
[10:54] diagnosed with this inoperable cancer,
[10:56] Lord, dear God, this cancer is nothing.
[11:00] Prophet told us, why do you fear cancer?
[11:03] nothing would stand in our way, not even
[11:05] cancer, Lord, if we can just only
[11:06] believe. And Lord Jesus, this man does
[11:09] not have any hope, dear God, outside of
[11:11] Christ. So Lord, may his heart be soft.
[11:14] May it be tender. May it be open, Lord,
[11:16] that he would receive Jesus Christ.
[11:19] Lord, in times like these, we need a
[11:21] savior. Times like these, we need a
[11:23] healer, Lord God. And our sister
[11:26] Patricia's uncle, Lord, he needs not
[11:27] only a healer, he needs a savior, Lord.
[11:30] Would you go to him, Father, in a
[11:32] sovereign way? Would you use our sister
[11:34] Patricia, Lord, our brother's the
[11:36] family, Lord God, to speak to this one,
[11:39] to reach out to that soul, Lord, and
[11:41] Father, and grab it, Lord, as it's
[11:43] falling. Just reach out, Lord Jesus, and
[11:45] just pull it in, Father. We're so
[11:47] thankful, Lord. Remember, Sister Debbie
[11:49] Paris is well, Lord, not feeling well in
[11:51] body, Lord Jesus. We pray that you'd
[11:53] strengthen her, Lord. We pray dear God
[11:55] that you will take away whatever
[11:57] infirmity is Lord that is laying her low
[12:00] dear God that she would be strengthened.
[12:01] She would be refreshed Lord that her
[12:03] faith too Lord God even as she would
[12:05] stream the service this morning Lord
[12:08] Father may her faith be strengthened.
[12:10] May she just stand upon her faith Lord
[12:12] and claim her healing. We just ask that
[12:15] you'll take the man of God this morning,
[12:17] Lord, our pastor. Lord, move the man
[12:19] aside, Lord. Move us aside, Lord Jesus.
[12:22] Put aside our thoughts. Just allow that
[12:25] word just to flow, Lord God, into our
[12:27] hearts. That we would be a different
[12:29] people, Lord, when we walk out of this
[12:31] place, packing the word of God, packing
[12:34] that life of Christ wherever we go,
[12:36] Lord, that we could be Jesus Christ in
[12:39] in flesh once again, testifying to the
[12:42] world that the resurrection is real,
[12:44] that the resurrection is on, the rapture
[12:47] is is on, dear God.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; So, Lord, we just ask that you'll anoint
[12:51] brother Derek as he leads us in worship.
[12:53] Anoint the musicians, Lord, as they they
[12:56] play the instruments, Lord, as they
[12:57] enter in as well. We just want to create
[13:00] an atmosphere, Father, this morning
[13:02] where faith can be, Lord, exercise where
[13:05] we can just believe, dear God, in what
[13:07] you have for us this morning. So, we
[13:08] just thank you for it in advance, Lord,
[13:10] as we receive it, no matter how hard it
[13:13] may come, no matter how cutting it may
[13:15] be, Lord, we just want to fit that
[13:17] perfect mold of Jesus Christ for our
[13:19] lives. So have your way now, Father, as
[13:22] we commit our lives into your hands in
[13:23] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.

[17:27] heart. Sometimes we're going through
[17:28] something, but times we just need to
[17:30] shake that off and just realize that the
[17:33] man within the man really is thankful.
[17:35] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the first man isn't always so
[17:38] thankful or grateful or appreciative,
[17:41] but we can get past that. Amen. Let's

[21:00] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful day.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; I get in the habit of pulling this
[21:05] microphone up when I don't need it.
[21:09] Uh, I just listened to the to the
[21:12] announcement for brother Matthew was
[21:15] saying to for the workers or whoever is
[21:20] a available to
[21:23] work with the books, the Chinese books
[21:25] or something, you know, there's so much
[21:27] that goes on in the background.
[21:30] God bless you, brother Chim. Such joy.
[21:33] So much goes on in the background that
[21:35] we don't realize. Just this is just uh
[21:39] just before I came to the pull pit and
[21:43] this is from a sister or woman in up in
[21:47] Mongolia
[21:49] and she just has sent this to brother
[21:52] Murphy.
[21:53] Dear brother,
[21:55] I am a sister in Christ from Inner
[21:58] Mongolia.
[22:00] I read Reverend Brham's message by
[22:03] chance recently.
[22:05] I was very shocked his messages got such
[22:09] a light though it was preached 40 years
[22:12] ago. I'm so thankful that the Lord let
[22:16] me con contact this message and also
[22:20] very thankful for the brethren who
[22:22] translated this message and uploaded it
[22:25] on the internet and may our heavenly
[22:28] father remember your labor and bless you
[22:31] abundantly. May there may there are uh
[22:36] more people to see this message and be
[22:40] blessed. Your sister in Christ, Lee
[22:43] Caying, I believe it is.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; So, here we are. You've been in it for
[22:49] maybe years.
[22:51] And here's a sister. Just because
[22:54] somebody translated, somebody's
[22:57] administrating, managing. There's a
[22:59] whole lot of technical things and just
[23:03] plain down to earth practical things
[23:06] that are done. But somebody is
[23:09] rejoicing.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; She can't believe that this message was
[23:14] spoken 40 years ago cuz it sounds like
[23:16] it's right for this moment for her. And
[23:19] it is for this moment for her. How
[23:21] wonderful that is. Amen.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; We'd say, "Praise the Lord."
[23:25] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that. I wonder if we
[23:29] could
[23:30] uh we're going to be calling up the
[23:32] deacons, which we've had acting for some
[23:36] time that we just recently put in. So,
[23:39] if they can get ready, I want to sing
[23:41] the chorus. Uh
[23:45] I lift pardon.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, I lift.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I lift your name. All right. Let's
[23:50] just stand as we sing it.
[23:54] I lift
[23:56] your name.
[24:00] Your holy
[24:04] name
[24:05] [Music]
[24:10] God,
[24:16] [Music]
[24:31] I will praise you.
[24:32] [Music]
[24:36] Hey,
[24:47] you're
[25:02] Yeah. Heat.
[25:15] my power.
[25:19] [Music]
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we worship you in spirit and
[25:29] in truth. We're so thankful for this
[25:32] time that we're able to stand here in
[25:34] your presence, under the banner of your
[25:38] word, under your wings, the everlasting
[25:41] wings. Oh God, now we pray that you will
[25:44] just attend, be in attendance with us in
[25:48] a special way. Lord, as we are calling
[25:51] the new deacons forward, we thank you
[25:55] for men that you have ordained, oh God,
[25:58] and chosen and gifted. We pray, Father,
[26:01] we may follow in your footsteps and may
[26:05] all be pleasing in your sight in Jesus
[26:07] name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. I'm
[26:11] going to call our brother Mark Ao,
[26:14] brother Doug Hendrickson,
[26:17] brother Martin Woolman, and brother
[26:20] Marco Vaner,
[26:22] and brother Ivan Hang if you would come
[26:26] forward. And then I'd like the other
[26:29] deacons if they could be ready in a few
[26:31] moments. But I want to address uh these
[26:35] brothers before the congregation.
[26:39] uh the scripture speaks of and the
[26:42] prophet of God also made reference to
[26:46] the trial period that there's a trial
[26:48] period. Uh it was some weeks ago. Now we
[26:52] had the congre we brought these brothers
[26:54] before the congregation asked you to
[26:56] raise your hand if you had any
[26:58] objection. If you raised your hand if
[27:01] you were in agreement that these
[27:04] brothers should serve. And then the
[27:07] scripture says, "Likewise must the
[27:08] deacons be grave, not double tonged, not
[27:13] given to much wine, not greedy of filthy
[27:17] lucer, holding the mystery of fa of the
[27:20] faith in a pure conscience. And let
[27:23] those also let these also first be
[27:27] proved." And that's where brother
[27:28] Brandham speaks of the trial period. Let
[27:31] them first be proved. Then let them use
[27:35] the office of a deacon, being found
[27:38] blameless. Even so must their wives be
[27:41] grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful
[27:44] in all things. Let the deacons be the
[27:47] husbands of one wife, ruling their
[27:50] children and their own houses well. For
[27:53] they that have used the office of a
[27:56] deacon well purchased to themselves a
[27:59] good degree and great boldness of faith
[28:02] which is in Christ Jesus.
[28:06] Brother Brenham speaks in placing of the
[28:09] deacons. Says, "And so therefore
[28:12] then it has been found favorable with
[28:15] the board and the pastor and the
[28:17] overseer
[28:18] to select in this group of people here
[28:21] some men who we think will be honorable
[28:24] and just men. we can only bring them and
[28:28] then it's then it's uh and it's then
[28:32] they are appointed by the church by
[28:36] their own vote and then these men shall
[28:39] serve if they feel that they will accept
[28:42] this office. This is the period that
[28:46] they have been in. Then they will come
[28:48] for a short time
[28:51] to see if they feel that they may be
[28:54] that God has called them. And if later
[28:57] if they feel that they are disqualified,
[29:00] then they have a right in the next few
[29:03] weeks to resign the office and someone
[29:06] else could be appointed in their place.
[29:09] We will ordain these deacons by laying
[29:12] on hands, deacons, and treasure in the
[29:15] church. But first they must be appointed
[29:19] and see how they like it and how the
[29:21] congregation likes it. And then if it's
[29:24] all right on both sides, then we make
[29:27] these men ordained deacons. And so I
[29:31] would like if the other deacons would
[29:33] come forward, please, and stand behind
[29:35] these brothers as well.
[29:41] Brother Tom, if you'll come.
[29:47] We'd like the congregation if you'll
[29:49] bow, please, as we
[29:53] join together and pray.
[29:57] Dear heavenly father,
[30:02] you're the one that is looking upon this
[30:05] scene. Yes,
[30:08] &gt;&gt; we are just men.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; We are just human.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; Our knowing is so limited. But you saw
[30:17] each of these men's lives.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; The first step they would take. You knew
[30:22] them before they were conceived.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; You're the almighty, almighty God, all
[30:28] knowing God, allseeing God, and have
[30:32] predestinated us. Oh father,
[30:35] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I pray that these men as
[30:37] they enter into this office that they
[30:39] have been serving
[30:41] &gt;&gt; that there will be a double portion of
[30:43] the Holy Ghost given to them.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Father, that according to your prophet's
[30:49] message that they may uh be men that
[30:51] will uh take their office seriously,
[30:55] that they will do fulfill it and with
[30:58] friendliness. Oh God,
[31:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that you will put a spirit
[31:02] upon them.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; May the Holy Ghost and the spirit of
[31:06] wisdom be upon them
[31:08] &gt;&gt; that they may know how to act and what
[31:09] to do in certain situations.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; I pray, oh Father, you will infuse them,
[31:15] Father. Endue them, oh God. May it not
[31:19] be their thoughts, but your thoughts
[31:20] that are being drawn. We lay our hands
[31:23] upon them, oh God, that they might
[31:26] fulfill and discharge their duties in a
[31:29] godly manner. And I pray, Father, that
[31:31] the congregation will have a great
[31:34] respect for them. And not for them as
[31:36] men only, but for the God that has
[31:38] called them.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; Father, they have seriously prayed about
[31:42] this even for months before entering and
[31:46] and accepting the office. And we we have
[31:50] seen the sincerity of their heart. And
[31:51] you have seen it certainly.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; And now, Father, we commend them to you
[31:56] &gt;&gt; and according to your word, appoint them
[31:58] into this office
[32:00] &gt;&gt; as deacons.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like you just to remain here if
[32:09] you would please. I have a few things
[32:12] that I would like to say concerning the
[32:15] deacons
[32:18] and so that it will not seem strange to
[32:21] the congregation.
[32:23] I felt for a long time and we've
[32:25] discussed it in a number of deacons
[32:27] meetings even over the years that the
[32:30] deacons should feel free to pray for the
[32:34] sick
[32:35] and even elders. But deacons and brother
[32:39] Brandham has said this, divine healings
[32:42] in reach of every person. Every person
[32:45] that is a Christian has a right to pray
[32:47] for the sick.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Do we say amen to that? Every Christian.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Every Christian
[32:54] has a right to pray for the sick. He
[32:58] said, "That's right. And if there's any
[32:59] among you sick, call the elders. That's
[33:01] the deacons in your church. and they and
[33:05] and then if they confess their faults
[33:08] one to another and pray for one another
[33:11] in expectations, he said, "And you don't
[33:13] have to wait until somebody got a
[33:16] healing campaign. Don't have to wait
[33:19] uh uh to be healed because your pastor
[33:24] or your neighbor that's a Christian,
[33:26] everybody, anybody's got a right to pray
[33:28] for you." The Bible said, "Confess your
[33:31] faults one to another and pray for one
[33:33] another that you might be healed. And if
[33:35] there's any sick among you, call the
[33:37] elders." Now, we call them in our
[33:39] groups. We call them the deacons. Let
[33:42] them call the elders of the church. Let
[33:45] them anoint you, anoint them with oil.
[33:47] And I will say to you, brothers, you
[33:49] should prepare yourself and have a have
[33:52] a a bottle of oil. We use the olive oil,
[33:55] a pure olive oil. and let them call for
[33:58] the elders of the church and let them
[34:00] anoint them in oil. It's not it's not
[34:04] called the elder but the elders plural
[34:07] and plural two or three and where two or
[34:10] three are gathered together and agreed
[34:13] and they pray.
[34:15] uh that's the way to do it in early
[34:18] spiritual experiences and there were so
[34:20] many we weren't able to go into it all
[34:23] but he said not only preachers but the
[34:25] deacons and the and the lay members pray
[34:28] ye one for another every Christian in
[34:32] here has just as much right to pray for
[34:34] the sick as I brother Bosworth brother
[34:37] Baxter brother Roberts or any other man
[34:40] there is now we need to take that to
[34:43] heart everybody has a right but but it
[34:46] also says to call for the elders of the
[34:49] church and brother Brandham said that is
[34:51] deacons. Now in the
[34:55] prophet also taught that we keep order
[34:57] in the church and uh uh and if and if
[35:02] there are any that are disturbing. So
[35:04] there was a question is it sufficient
[35:06] openly from the pulpit that tongues and
[35:08] interpretation that was when gifts were
[35:10] being used in a disorderly fashion. And
[35:13] that's why they were talking about
[35:14] order. So I wanted to be to specify. And
[35:18] he said that's the second question. They
[35:21] had two questions and questions and
[35:22] answers on the paper. He said uh now
[35:27] this would be pertaining to the pastor
[35:29] here. The question of should there
[35:31] tongues interpretation. He said that's
[35:33] concerning that that that that's would
[35:36] be pertaining to the pastor because he
[35:38] after all over the spiritual part he's
[35:41] the head of that. But deacons are
[35:43] policemen in the church to keep order
[35:46] and to take care of these things and
[35:49] feeding the poor and so forth and the
[35:52] trustees over the financial finance of
[35:54] the building and that's what they look
[35:56] after but the pastors over the
[35:58] supervising of the spiritual part and
[36:00] this would go to you brother Neville he
[36:02] said at that time then on another
[36:04] question he said the deacons your duty
[36:07] is to keep order in the church with
[36:09] kindness and friendliness And then
[36:12] another place, how f how far brother
[36:15] Brandham can or should a deacon go to
[36:18] keep order in the church? Should we keep
[36:21] the order or wait until brother Neville
[36:23] tells us what we should do? And he said,
[36:25] "That isn't brother Neville's job.
[36:28] That's your job." Speaking to the
[36:30] deacons. And if a man's doing something
[36:32] wrong in here in the church or anybody's
[36:34] u or anybody, stop them. Talk to them.
[36:38] Don't be arrogant. But if they won't
[36:40] listen, uh speak in a way that they know
[36:43] that that what you're saying. Uh he said
[36:46] like I if I tell a child walk back there
[36:48] and he's misbehaving, deacons, he said
[36:52] uh deacons stay at your place. There's
[36:55] uh four of you in that church. There was
[36:57] four uh stay two in front and two at the
[37:00] back at these corners. So he's telling
[37:02] them where to position themselves. And
[37:04] then he said, "Watch real close for
[37:06] renegades." He said, "Surprising
[37:08] renegades do come amongst the
[37:10] believers." And he said, "Watch real
[37:12] close for renegades." Some of you may
[37:13] not even be aware, but these brothers
[37:15] have had to deal with renegades from
[37:17] time to time. And I could spend probably
[37:20] the next hour and tell you about a few
[37:22] that we've we've had. So, watch real
[37:25] close for renegades and everything else
[37:27] that comes in this. He said, "You see,
[37:31] and you be on guard and you get get to
[37:34] your post of duty and stay there. Uh,
[37:38] that's your seat or stand right beside a
[37:41] wall and watch everybody come in." Now,
[37:45] I'm going to just take up something
[37:46] while I keep the men, the deacon
[37:49] brothers, standing here because it's a
[37:52] it's a need in not only this church, but
[37:55] a need in perhaps many, many churches.
[37:58] And it's perhaps something you don't uh
[38:00] realize, but it's something that I want
[38:03] you to really take to heart.
[38:07] And that's this. There's far too much
[38:09] movement of people in this church.
[38:13] Far too much. And this will be perhaps a
[38:16] shock. Perhaps some don't move at all.
[38:19] And I realize there are those with
[38:20] children. They must move. They must go
[38:23] in. They must come out. So are those
[38:25] that are of necessity.
[38:27] And someone may be ill or sick or
[38:30] something and need to uh they need help
[38:33] or they need to go out and that is
[38:36] perfectly fine.
[38:39] Uh but
[38:41] brother Brandham said that each of us
[38:43] have a spirit and he refers to it many
[38:46] many times and so that uh if you move
[38:51] and distract you distract others it's
[38:54] not just yourself you distract others
[38:57] and it distracts the Holy Spirit because
[39:01] you have a spirit and God is dealing
[39:03] with other people and then there's this
[39:05] movement and unnecess I'm talking about
[39:07] unnecessary movement
[39:09] You parents, parents, you make certain
[39:13] that your child absolutely needs to go
[39:17] out and then you should actually go out
[39:20] with them and see that they come right
[39:23] back in because they go out and whether
[39:26] in the washroom or sitting out in the
[39:28] hallway or something that's this is the
[39:30] house of God. Amen.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; And something that I've noticed, it's
[39:34] almost become a habit and I'd like it to
[39:36] stop as of this morning. And that is
[39:39] when the brother finishes his message.
[39:43] And if we know the scripture, the
[39:44] scripture says, "And the and and then
[39:48] God, he confirmed the word with signs
[39:52] following."
[39:54] &gt;&gt; It happens after brother Brandham after
[39:56] the ministering of the word would call
[39:58] the sick and afflicted. And then and
[40:00] then he had the same problem over and
[40:02] over dozens of times and the people
[40:04] start to move and he'd say, "You're not
[40:06] to move. Don't move." Because that that
[40:10] disturbs it even disturbed him as a
[40:12] prophet in the in the ministry to the
[40:15] people because he'd say, "You have a
[40:17] spirit. You have a human spirit." And
[40:19] then he indicated one place if there's
[40:21] someone that's that's tending towards
[40:23] unbelief or maybe they've got uh some
[40:26] critical uh attitude or whatever more it
[40:30] seems to foster that. And then he talked
[40:32] about spirits jumping and going back and
[40:35] forth. And so uh when the minister's
[40:40] done preaching says let's just bow out
[40:42] and have a prayer. That's not the time
[40:45] for an exodus. That's the time to sit
[40:48] and pray that now the Holy Spirit. Take
[40:52] a hold of the word and confirm it to the
[40:55] people. Now, now we're coming to the
[40:57] real part. The word's been preached and
[41:00] we want to see there's somebody.
[41:03] It's not you and having to go to the
[41:05] washroom or something else or just go
[41:07] out. It's not possible that even all of
[41:09] that. This is embarrassing, but I I and
[41:13] I don't want you to think that I do this
[41:14] when I sit here, but I actually counted
[41:17] and I never counted nearly all the
[41:20] movement. I didn't count the little
[41:22] children going in and out. and one of
[41:25] brother and one of while brother Dodd
[41:28] preached and at the end of the service
[41:30] and I counted those went out there was a
[41:33] a hundred
[41:36] a h 100red bodies that moved in this
[41:38] church and that is simply not necessary
[41:43] I'm 76 and I very rarely ever have to go
[41:47] out and if you're got a physical problem
[41:51] come up here and we'll pray for you
[41:53] &gt;&gt; so you'll to be able to sit through the
[41:55] service. And uh and if you have
[41:57] children, you make sure as parents that
[41:59] they absolutely have to go out because a
[42:03] lot of times it's just an excuse and
[42:05] they just want to get out. And you young
[42:08] people are up in your teens, you don't
[42:09] have any reason to go out. Amen.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; And so I'm saying this while the deacons
[42:17] are here that we are to monitor that and
[42:22] make sure that that is absolutely
[42:24] necessary.
[42:26] And this is what brother Brandham said
[42:28] regarding that. He said don't move
[42:29] around.
[42:33] Now, everybody be real quiet just for a
[42:37] few moments.
[42:40] If you'll just give us the at least five
[42:42] more minutes, I'll be glad to dismiss
[42:45] it. But don't move around. It
[42:48] interrupts. And you see, when you do
[42:50] this, you and then he breaks when you're
[42:53] when you're dealing with the spirit of
[42:54] God, it's just so sensitive.
[42:59] Don't nobody be in a hurry. And please
[43:02] don't move around while the spirit of
[43:05] the Lord is at work. While it's moving,
[43:09] be reverent.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Is this good instruction?
[43:13] &gt;&gt; This is absolutely essential
[43:15] instruction. And if you wonder why maybe
[43:17] more isn't happening in the service, a
[43:21] more supernatural, the the hindrance can
[43:23] be maybe right in the congregation. And
[43:26] we want to do everything. At least we
[43:29] want to say we did everything that we
[43:31] know to do.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I would say at the end
[43:36] of the service, you go to prayer.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; You just start praying. You start you
[43:41] start leaning into the message with a
[43:43] with a minister. I don't care who you
[43:45] are. You just bow your head and be real
[43:47] reverend. Say, "Oh, God, come on the
[43:50] scene now. This word was preached for a
[43:53] purpose. Somebody needs to be touched.
[43:56] We want to see the Holy Spirit touch
[43:58] people's lives and be affected. And then
[44:01] when they go out, perhaps they're the
[44:03] very ones that need it. And when they go
[44:05] out, their lives will be changed.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; He said in in the message, Abraham, now
[44:12] be real reverend. I know it's getting
[44:13] late and many times I know it's getting
[44:16] late, but if you'll just stand just for
[44:19] one one more and don't move around, I'll
[44:22] appreciate it. You're a you are a
[44:25] spirit. If you wouldn't he you would be
[44:27] dead and your spirit sometimes when
[44:30] unbelief becomes so dense it hinders. So
[44:34] you're just talking about even the
[44:35] movement and if someone else is there
[44:37] and they're they're filled with uh
[44:40] unbelief and it becomes so dense.
[44:43] Maybe there's maybe there's a resistance
[44:45] to the word that's been preached. What
[44:48] he's indicating is that a movement
[44:50] disrupts the Holy Spirit and that person
[44:54] is is is uh uh doesn't get delivered
[44:57] from their unbelief. And that's the best
[44:59] way I can say it. And so I would like
[45:01] the congregation to know that we're
[45:04] officially saying this to the to you and
[45:08] we know that you'll respect it. I I
[45:10] sense and I feel a real acceptance and
[45:13] uh and whoever it is that's preaching.
[45:16] But I can tell you that I know that if a
[45:18] prophet of God with the angel of the
[45:21] Lord beside him needed people to be
[45:24] reverent and to be still and especially
[45:27] at the end of the service and if you
[45:29] know what someone says to me, oh a child
[45:32] was really disruptive in the service and
[45:34] did it bother you? Not a bit. Said
[45:36] didn't even hear it. That doesn't bother
[45:38] me. I think that parents are they're
[45:41] they do their very best and if they have
[45:43] to slip out well we have a cry room and
[45:45] a nursery and so we try to do that for
[45:48] you because I know that parents don't
[45:50] want to see their children disrupt a
[45:52] service. If you have to slip out and the
[45:53] child has to slip out, that's fine. But
[45:56] we don't don't don't
[45:58] train them that they just up and go and
[46:01] come back and then everything else and
[46:04] and so you young people, I've been in
[46:07] church all through my teens and we don't
[46:09] have to get up and move around, walk
[46:11] around. So we'll just be real real
[46:14] reverent. And when it's necessary, hey,
[46:18] God knows it, the Holy Spirit knows it,
[46:20] we know it, and everything's perfectly
[46:22] fine. So there's no added bondage to it.
[46:25] It's just respect.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the people said,
[46:29] &gt;&gt; "Amen." And the people smiled.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Good. God bless you.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; All right, brothers, to your post. Amen.
[46:49] Still feeling all right?
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Good.
[46:56] I'll have you stand and I I want to sing
[47:00] that chorus to Word of God Ever True.
[47:02] Changing me, Changing You.
[47:05] [Music]
[47:13] Ever true
[47:15] changing me,
[47:18] changing you.
[47:21] I come
[47:23] with open hearts for let the word of God
[47:30] once again. Word of God,
[47:34] ever true,
[47:36] changing me,
[47:39] changing you. We have come with open
[47:44] hearts. Oh, let the word of God.
[47:50] I want to sing it once more. And you
[47:53] turn around and shake hands if you feel
[47:55] like it with someone else. Word of God
[47:57] ever true. Changing me, changing you. We
[48:01] have come with open hearts. Oh
[48:04] hallelujah. And let the word of God
[48:07] impart.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And I'll accept the
[48:10] last line. You can sing it to me.
[48:15] Word of God.
[48:20] Changing you.
[48:23] Changing you.
[48:25] [Music]
[48:27] Heat.
[48:28] [Music]
[48:33] Heat.
[48:41] [Applause]
[48:45] We have
[48:47] faith.
[48:50] Oh, let the word of God impart.
[48:56] Hallelujah.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; You can take your Bibles if you would
[49:01] please and turn to John's gospel the
[49:03] fifth chapter.
[49:14] [Applause]
[49:16] John's Gospel
[49:19] 5
[49:20] and verse
[49:22] 19.
[49:35] and then answered Jesus and said unto
[49:38] them, "Verily, verily,
[49:40] I say unto you,
[49:43] the Son can do nothing of himself, but
[49:46] what he seeth the Father do."
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Like you to stress that, but what he
[49:53] seeth the Father do. For what things
[49:57] soever he doeth, these also doeth the
[50:01] Son likewise.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. For the Father loveth the Son, and
[50:06] showeth him all things, that himself
[50:09] doeth, and he will show him greater
[50:12] works than these, that ye may marvel.
[50:17] And then the 10th chapter of John,
[50:21] we'll read also at verse 18.
[50:31] Now, just before we read this scripture,
[50:34] I want you to be mindful that
[50:37] Jesus has said that that he does nothing
[50:41] except what the father showeth him.
[50:45] Brother Brandham said he saw visions,
[50:46] but also
[50:48] brother Brandham didn't always see
[50:50] visions, but what the father showed him,
[50:54] what he saw the father do, so doeth the
[50:57] son likewise.
[50:59] and he did nothing but the father showed
[51:02] him what needed to be done. I would like
[51:05] to include in that the father must have
[51:09] showed him Calvary
[51:12] who for the who for the cross and the
[51:15] suffering that was set before him he
[51:17] endured the cross
[51:20] and he embraced it.
[51:22] And so in the 18th verse here, he's
[51:26] speaking about his life.
[51:30] No man taketh it from me, but I lay it
[51:33] down of myself. I have power to lay it
[51:37] down, and I have power to take it again.
[51:41] This commandment have I received of my
[51:44] father.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; His father showed him already that he
[51:49] had power to take his to lay his life
[51:51] down. had power to take it up again and
[51:54] he was going to lay his life down and no
[51:56] man takes it from me. He said this I
[51:58] this commandment I've already received
[52:00] this of my father.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you know that friends,
[52:05] you have confidence.
[52:07] All right. You may have your seats. And
[52:09] when you do, if you'll open your Bible,
[52:11] please to the book of Exodus. I want to
[52:14] read
[52:16] in Exodus
[52:23] uh the 12th chapter
[52:26] and we're going to read
[52:29] concerning the Passover.
[52:43] And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron
[52:46] in the land of Egypt, saying, "This
[52:49] month shall be unto you the beginning of
[52:52] months, it shall be the first month of
[52:55] the year to you, speaking unto all the
[52:59] congregation of Israel, saying, In the
[53:02] 10th day of this month, they shall take
[53:05] to them every man a lamb according to
[53:07] the house of their fathers, a lamb for
[53:10] an house. And if the household be too
[53:13] little for the lamb, let him and his
[53:16] neighbor next unto his house take it
[53:20] according to the number of souls. Every
[53:22] man according to his eating shall make
[53:25] your count for the lamb. Your lamb shall
[53:28] be without blemish, a male of the first
[53:31] year. You shall take it out from the
[53:34] sheep or from the goats, and you shall
[53:38] keep it up until the 14th day of that
[53:42] same month. And the whole assembly of
[53:45] the congregation of Israel shall kill it
[53:48] in the evening. And they shall take it.
[53:52] They shall take of the blood and strike
[53:54] it on the two doorposts and on the upper
[53:57] doorpost of the houses wherein they
[54:01] shall eat it.
[54:04] I'll stop reading there and we just ask
[54:07] the Lord to grant us understanding of
[54:11] his word
[54:12] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[54:14] How many were at the camp or saw the
[54:19] presentation
[54:20] that was done? And I believe uh brother
[54:24] Rickart
[54:25] was one of the senior men. Brother
[54:28] Matthew Ordeal was another one. And I
[54:31] saw Matthew and it was his
[54:34] responsibility to put the blood on the
[54:36] doorposts
[54:38] in such urgency and such How many saw
[54:41] that? How many? All right.
[54:44] And one of the things that uh
[54:48] uh impressed me while I was watching
[54:50] that and moved me it was very much a
[54:53] moving experience that he was taking
[54:55] with such desperation while others were
[54:57] laxed about it and you know well I don't
[55:00] know this household wasn't taken very
[55:03] serious but he is the father of this of
[55:05] his household he was taking it and with
[55:07] the with the hissup and was putting it
[55:11] on the doorpost and rubbing it so
[55:13] vigorous seriously on there. And the
[55:16] word that's used in the Bible is strike
[55:19] the doorposts.
[55:21] And I want to speak on today on doing
[55:26] the will of God.
[55:29] Uh doing the will of God, applying the
[55:32] will of God. And this is only I will
[55:34] only be able to introduce it today
[55:36] because there are so many subjects, so
[55:39] many things and parts of our life that
[55:41] need to be addressed.
[55:43] Uh
[55:45] the Bible is full, absolutely full of
[55:48] scriptures, far too many for me to even
[55:52] bring to you this morning that have to
[55:54] do with hearing the word of God or doing
[55:58] the word of God or doing the will of
[56:01] God. I have uh I have these scriptures
[56:06] which we have uh which we have read and
[56:10] I thought perhaps it would be good for
[56:12] us just to look at them again. Then
[56:15] Jesus said unto them, verily I say unto
[56:18] you, the son can do nothing of himself,
[56:21] but what he seeth the father do. For
[56:26] what things soever he doeth, these also
[56:30] doeth the son likewise. The reason I
[56:34] have brought this scripture up before
[56:35] you so we can read it again is this
[56:38] happens to be one scripture that brother
[56:39] Brham refers to all the time,
[56:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Indicating because he he knew well that
[56:47] people wanted him to do things wanted if
[56:49] you can see a vision you can see a
[56:50] vision for me. If you can tell that
[56:52] person, you can tell me. So he was
[56:54] indicating that it could only be as the
[56:57] father. For the father loveth the son
[57:00] and showeth him all things that himself
[57:03] doeth. And he will show him greater
[57:05] works than these that ye may that ye may
[57:08] marvel.
[57:13] Jesus did
[57:15] what he saw the father do.
[57:18] He applied what he saw to his own life
[57:22] and walked into it. So it's not only
[57:25] seeing what should be done, but it is
[57:28] walking into it and doing it.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus saw Calvary, the suffering and the
[57:35] victory and applied himself to fulfill
[57:38] it.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; He walked towards Jerusalem with a
[57:42] conscious decision. And even when others
[57:44] wanted to make him a king, he walked he
[57:47] walked willingly to his death. And it
[57:50] says in Hebrews, who for the joy that
[57:53] was set before him endured the cross,
[57:56] despising the shame and is sat down at
[57:59] the right hand of the throne of God. So
[58:02] he was not living his life just for the
[58:04] victorious part of it. He saw that in
[58:07] suffering and in paying the price, there
[58:10] was also this great victory.
[58:15] No man,
[58:17] no man taketh it from me, but I lay it
[58:20] down of myself. I have power to lay it
[58:23] down, and I have power to take it again.
[58:26] Th this commandment have I received of
[58:30] my father,
[58:34] and he that sent me is with me. The
[58:37] Father hath not left me alone, for I do
[58:43] always
[58:45] those things that please him. The Father
[58:49] have not. Now, if that was his case and
[58:52] Jesus Christ, this Jesus Christ is
[58:54] present, I'm only using terms that we
[58:56] use so often in the message and this
[58:59] Jesus Christ is expressing himself and
[59:02] is living in flesh again today, then I
[59:04] would say the same principles need to be
[59:07] in place.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; The father that that has sent me hath
[59:12] not left me alone.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. because or for I do always not as
[59:19] I hear always or I see always I do
[59:24] always
[59:25] &gt;&gt; those things that please him.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; The character of Jesus Christ always
[59:34] does those things that please the
[59:37] father. Now to to do is are these
[59:41] things. To act rightly,
[59:44] to perform,
[59:46] to bring forth,
[59:49] to carry out,
[59:51] to do well
[59:54] or and to fulfill.
[59:59] Now, I want to tie this scripture to it.
[1:00:03] for the trial of your faith being much
[1:00:06] more precious than gold that perisheth.
[1:00:10] And brother Brandham talks about there
[1:00:11] is a gold of God. And the gold of God is
[1:00:16] a Christlike character. It's why I was
[1:00:19] referring to the character of Jesus
[1:00:21] Christ. I do always those things that
[1:00:25] please the father.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; It's not that I hear them, I do them.
[1:00:30] Not that I see them, I do them. I don't
[1:00:33] come to the synagogue and just hear it.
[1:00:36] I do those things that the father that
[1:00:39] pleases the father. And so the gold of
[1:00:42] God is a Christlike character produced
[1:00:45] in the fiery furnace of affliction. And
[1:00:48] that is the right kind of gold.
[1:00:52] The importance of applying
[1:00:55] what we hear is brought out in this
[1:00:57] great with great emphasis in the account
[1:01:01] of the Passover night in Egypt. And
[1:01:04] that's why that's where I tie the two
[1:01:07] together. So, we're speaking of the
[1:01:09] character of Jesus Christ, how we have
[1:01:13] his spirit in us. And if his spirit is
[1:01:16] in in us, that spirit is urging us to be
[1:01:21] doers of the word and not hearers only.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; And you said amen to that.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; All right. Now,
[1:01:36] you might it might take a moment for you
[1:01:38] just to
[1:01:40] uh connect these two scriptures
[1:01:43] together, but I I'm I'm sure that it
[1:01:46] will be this will be a meaningful
[1:01:48] service for you. The we're we're uh very
[1:01:53] very conscious today of all kinds of
[1:01:56] product and all kinds of equipment and
[1:01:59] all kinds of things. And I have to make
[1:02:01] a confession. I'm glad for the brothers
[1:02:03] that are around the office. You know,
[1:02:05] Brother Aaron, brother Darren, Brother
[1:02:07] Michael, and you know, Brother Tom. I
[1:02:10] call all these people all the time. And
[1:02:12] it's something that I and my wife, we
[1:02:13] have kind of going between us. She says,
[1:02:15] "I can't. This thing doesn't work. I did
[1:02:17] that, but it doesn't work. I punch those
[1:02:20] buttons. I can't make my Did I lose it?"
[1:02:23] I said, "You can't lose it. It's on the
[1:02:25] disc." You know, she always, you know, I
[1:02:28] said I said, 'Well, why don't you call
[1:02:31] Michael? You know, that's what these
[1:02:33] guys are getting paid for. Why don't you
[1:02:34] call Brother Aaron? They know. I don't
[1:02:37] know. I can't fix it, but just call
[1:02:39] them. They know. Do you know why I don't
[1:02:42] know? I'm I don't read very well. I
[1:02:45] mean, I can read. I can understand, but
[1:02:47] I've never been able to operate a
[1:02:49] camera. I just All those dials, they
[1:02:52] just drive me crazy. Amen.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Do I have any friends here?
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. You're my You're bu
[1:03:00] buddies indeed.
[1:03:02] I just, you know, and if I have to read
[1:03:04] too much about how the computer and the
[1:03:07] thing works, and I'll never I'll never
[1:03:09] forget, you know, Brother Rod Bergen
[1:03:11] came over to my place when we had the
[1:03:13] first uh uh boat anchor
[1:03:18] computer and we managed to get this
[1:03:20] thing real cheap. and he came over to my
[1:03:22] house and, you know, set it all up and
[1:03:25] everything and and the thing scared me.
[1:03:28] I I was I So he sat back and okay, you
[1:03:30] turn it on and I I I turned it on and
[1:03:33] it, you know, didn't do something
[1:03:35] happened that wasn't supposed to happen.
[1:03:37] And I'm saying to the machine, I am
[1:03:39] sorry
[1:03:41] and he just roared because I was looking
[1:03:44] on the thing as something, you know,
[1:03:45] almost human. And uh and so then uh you
[1:03:50] know he went and every everything was
[1:03:52] fine. Now I knew exactly how to do it.
[1:03:54] And here's the book. And so I'm reading
[1:03:56] looking at the book. Okay. You push this
[1:04:00] button to start. I pushed it to start.
[1:04:03] And it says now you'll notice that
[1:04:06] there's a cursor at the upper left hand
[1:04:09] corner of the thing. And there was no
[1:04:11] cursor there. So I did what I do best. I
[1:04:14] dialed the phone. I I got brother Rod on
[1:04:17] the phone. Brother Rod, it says the
[1:04:19] second thing that was to happen is
[1:04:21] there's supposed to be a cursor at the
[1:04:23] top left hand corner of the screen. It's
[1:04:26] not there. He says, "Oh, yeah." He says,
[1:04:28] "They're always doing that." Well, you
[1:04:30] know, just don't pay any attention to
[1:04:31] it. So, I found that one of the good
[1:04:34] answers is don't pay any attention to a
[1:04:35] lot of the stuff. But on the other hand,
[1:04:38] a lot of it doesn't work. Do you know
[1:04:40] why? Because you need to follow the
[1:04:43] instructions. And if you buy a product,
[1:04:46] they will have on there the instructions
[1:04:49] and the more the more important uh
[1:04:54] the more critical I'll put the more
[1:04:56] critical the product, you know, if it's
[1:04:58] an epoxy and you have just a few seconds
[1:05:00] to put the two together and once it
[1:05:02] touches, you can't break it apart for
[1:05:04] nothing. it's a it's a crazy glue or
[1:05:07] it's some kind of an adhesive and you
[1:05:09] want to I I want to put this thing
[1:05:11] together and and you and it's real
[1:05:14] critical. Well, you you can't just say,
[1:05:16] "Well, you know what? I'll just uh I
[1:05:19] think I know how to do without the
[1:05:20] instructions." No, you need to read the
[1:05:23] instructions
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; very carefully and then follow those
[1:05:27] instructions. The company is saying to
[1:05:30] you, if you follow these instructions,
[1:05:33] you will come out with this result.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; And a lot of us, we don't get the result
[1:05:38] because we don't follow the
[1:05:40] instructions.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the truth?
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; With the word of God, you know, I'm just
[1:05:46] being honest with you now in this
[1:05:47] service. We don't see a lot of what we
[1:05:50] want to see because we haven't followed
[1:05:52] the instructions. The instructions
[1:05:54] aren't complicated there. It's the
[1:05:56] simplicity of it. You say, "Well, it's
[1:05:58] so simple." That's right. Just do it.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Just do it and you'll find the blessing
[1:06:04] of God come right on behind it. And in
[1:06:06] this instantaneous, you know, this
[1:06:08] generation, we have instant this and
[1:06:10] instant that. And we want it right away.
[1:06:12] It doesn't happen right away. It's a
[1:06:15] life. This this walk is a is a whole
[1:06:18] life.
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:25] I'll get to preaching after a while.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Well, my wife and I, we got concerned
[1:06:31] about our weight. When you read things,
[1:06:34] you know that with every pound you lose
[1:06:38] 5 years or something. My goodness. Well,
[1:06:40] we then you we read some pretty scary
[1:06:43] stuff. So, I thought, well, we better,
[1:06:46] you know, do something. Okay. So, she
[1:06:49] got us all enrolled at this place and it
[1:06:52] wasn't a diet place. It was a medical
[1:06:54] place, medical thing. So, we go there
[1:06:56] and we sat there with some other people
[1:06:58] and not a whole lot of us, just a few of
[1:07:00] us. And they're telling us right away
[1:07:03] and they just they just put me in in the
[1:07:06] dumps immediately. They said, "This is
[1:07:09] not a diet.
[1:07:11] We're not going to tell you how to diet.
[1:07:14] This is a way of life.
[1:07:17] what you start now is what you do for
[1:07:19] the rest of your days. And I thought, oh
[1:07:22] man, I want something sudden. I want
[1:07:26] something to happen right away. I don't
[1:07:28] want to be told this has to carry on the
[1:07:30] rest of my life.
[1:07:33] And there was a big fellow. I mean, he
[1:07:35] was a big houseky and his his children
[1:07:38] made him come because he had had a heart
[1:07:41] attack and he was at great risk and he
[1:07:44] was a a monster of a barrelchested man.
[1:07:47] And and this woman came out and she had
[1:07:50] in her hand uh a a little piece of is
[1:07:53] some phony food, you know, and she said,
[1:07:57] "Okay, this are the portions that you
[1:08:00] need to eat in this new way of life that
[1:08:03] you're going to live.
[1:08:05] and and he was right in front of her and
[1:08:07] he said, "This is the portion of meat."
[1:08:10] That's a portion of meat that big
[1:08:12] around. And this guy probably, you know,
[1:08:14] he a 16 steak wouldn't do him any more
[1:08:17] than he needed. And and she had him take
[1:08:20] this take it and he took that little
[1:08:22] piece of meat and held his hand. And I
[1:08:25] could see if there ever was unbelief on
[1:08:27] a face, unbelief was on his face.
[1:08:30] There's no way that I'm gonna live the
[1:08:32] rest of my life eating this little piece
[1:08:34] of almost looked like a little piece of
[1:08:36] rubber.
[1:08:38] I told my wife of all whatever it cost,
[1:08:41] whatever you spent. I did learn the one
[1:08:43] thing that it's not it's not a diet that
[1:08:47] works. It's not something a quick it's
[1:08:50] not a quick thing. You have to set on a
[1:08:53] course of life.
[1:08:56] this life that we've entered into
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; this message life, this word life. It's
[1:09:03] not even coming and standing here and
[1:09:05] somebody prays for you and you feel
[1:09:07] better. That's not it.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; You come to the front or in your own
[1:09:11] prayer closet and you make you do
[1:09:13] business with God and you intend to live
[1:09:16] live that direction the rest of your
[1:09:18] life.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; This is a way of life. It's not
[1:09:22] something you just put on or something.
[1:09:23] I go to church. I feel better. I talked
[1:09:25] to one one young woman. She she said,
[1:09:28] "Well, I she was Catholic. I go to
[1:09:30] church and I go to confessional every
[1:09:33] week. I go to confessional because I
[1:09:35] feel better." Well, she probably does.
[1:09:38] That's not a solution. The the the sad
[1:09:42] thing about that is that when she goes
[1:09:44] and feels better, Satan deceives her
[1:09:46] into thinking that that has something to
[1:09:48] do with spirituality. That has nothing
[1:09:51] to do with spirituality. You know, you
[1:09:53] can you can have a big row at home and
[1:09:56] then ball and cry and then say to each
[1:09:58] other, "Well, I'm sorry." You will feel
[1:10:00] better, but it may not be the remedy.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; You know, that may be part of the
[1:10:05] remedy, but it might not be all the
[1:10:06] remedy. We come to church, we hear
[1:10:09] things, we get happy, we feel good. It's
[1:10:12] not to this this place here isn't here
[1:10:14] to feel good. The message didn't come
[1:10:16] here to make us feel good. Brother
[1:10:18] Brandham even said when we come into
[1:10:20] when we become a Christian, that's when
[1:10:22] war starts. Then we're in a battle.
[1:10:24] We're in a struggle. But the word of God
[1:10:27] gives us the answer how to be
[1:10:29] victorious.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there's a certain
[1:10:33] there's a certain pattern we need to
[1:10:35] follow. And that's what I'm wanting to
[1:10:38] speak about. And one thing is absolutely
[1:10:41] certain and that is that it that what we
[1:10:44] hear must be applied. And they shall
[1:10:47] take the blood. But prior to this, prior
[1:10:49] to this, I want to make some emphasis
[1:10:51] slowly.
[1:10:53] The source, the source of the
[1:10:55] instructions,
[1:10:57] you know, if you if you have a product,
[1:11:00] the instructions for application must
[1:11:04] come from the people who know the
[1:11:05] product must come from the people who
[1:11:08] know what it'll do, who who who has
[1:11:11] designed this whole thing. And God for
[1:11:14] the first time. Now we say and Moses and
[1:11:17] Aaron. Well, Moses, just remember, God
[1:11:19] had never had a prophet like Moses.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; This was a new source.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; This was a whole new thing with the
[1:11:26] people. They had not had anybody ever
[1:11:28] come down, not even Noah or anyone else
[1:11:31] came and said, "Thus sayaith the Lord."
[1:11:33] But now God has instituted amongst
[1:11:37] humanity a man that he's going to speak
[1:11:39] to. And that man is going to be required
[1:11:43] to utter what God has spoken to him. And
[1:11:45] he says, "Thus saith the Lord." No
[1:11:48] wonder that the messenger of this time.
[1:11:50] No wonder that brother Brandham made so
[1:11:53] many references uh to to Moses and the
[1:11:56] and even God when says you'll be given
[1:11:59] two gifts, two signs like Moses
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; because that was when it was instituted.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; He was the first prophet. And now we
[1:12:07] have a last messenger to the gentile
[1:12:10] age. A last prophet messenger. Can you
[1:12:13] realize that? The last prophet
[1:12:15] messenger. They had a first one. We have
[1:12:17] a last one. And he was giving them
[1:12:20] specific instructions.
[1:12:22] Now I'm talking about success for your
[1:12:24] life. Young men,
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; young ladies,
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; young families, and all age groups and
[1:12:33] all situations.
[1:12:35] There there is a there is a success for
[1:12:37] a believer's life. There's no believer
[1:12:41] with this Bible in my hand that ought to
[1:12:44] live below what God has purchased for
[1:12:48] them.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; You are in agreement with that.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; We should not live below our rights. And
[1:12:54] I if I might not be attained to it, I
[1:12:57] will thrust you forward and say you
[1:13:00] believe.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; And whatever God puts in your heart to
[1:13:03] believe, God grant it to you. Amen.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; But there are specific instructions. We
[1:13:08] cannot ignore the instructions and
[1:13:10] expect to have
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; success.
[1:13:15] Amen.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; And so it went on to say,
[1:13:19] "And they shall take the blood, that was
[1:13:22] the substance, and strike it, not just
[1:13:26] strike it, but strike it on the
[1:13:27] doorposts and on the upper doorpost of
[1:13:31] the houses wherein they shall eat it."
[1:13:37] and then in and e Exodus also the 22nd
[1:13:41] uh chapter 12th verse rather 22nd
[1:13:43] chapter and you shall take a bunch of
[1:13:46] hissup now hissup was a common weed
[1:13:49] brother Brandham calls it a common weed
[1:13:52] and so I'm I'm I'm standing here and
[1:13:55] you're sitting there but I want to say
[1:13:58] when it comes to the application
[1:14:00] of of uh the redemptive uh the
[1:14:03] redemptive powers you have as much
[1:14:06] access to it as I do.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; And that is why God said just because
[1:14:11] the hissup was available to anybody.
[1:14:14] Hipup was just a common weed. And you
[1:14:16] take the hissup and you'll you'll dip it
[1:14:19] in the blood and you'll strike it on the
[1:14:21] doorpost. And so it's a wonderful thing
[1:14:24] the blood the blood they they they
[1:14:26] didn't have any access to manufacture
[1:14:29] the blood, but they could just take
[1:14:31] hissup a common weed. And that's why the
[1:14:33] Bible also says the common people heard
[1:14:36] him gladly because it's a common gospel
[1:14:39] if I can put it that it's not a
[1:14:40] difficult gospel.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; So this scripture in in Egypt is
[1:14:48] recording the first and only time God
[1:14:53] would deliver his children out of Egypt.
[1:14:55] He didn't have to deliver them over and
[1:14:57] over and over. He delivered them once.
[1:14:59] He had a process by which he would do
[1:15:01] it. And it is at this time, this first
[1:15:04] time that the Passover lamb
[1:15:08] I cannot stress the importance pointing
[1:15:10] right to Jesus Christ. The Passover lamb
[1:15:13] and the token are introduced as a type
[1:15:17] of Jesus Christ. the first and only time
[1:15:20] that they're introduced as uh or or
[1:15:23] rather that they he has introduced them
[1:15:26] amongst his people and they would remain
[1:15:29] as a foundation throughout all all the
[1:15:32] time. The blood. The blood. Now I'm
[1:15:35] coming to it. The blood had to be must
[1:15:39] be absolutely essential that it be
[1:15:44] applied precisely as commanded.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; If the blood was not applied, death came
[1:15:51] to the house.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; And if we have a bleeding word, would
[1:15:58] you agree with that?
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; You have a bleeding word. I have a
[1:16:02] bleeding word.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; The bleeding word must be applied
[1:16:07] according to the instructions.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; It has to be precisely according to the
[1:16:16] instructions.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Someone will say, well, I can just get
[1:16:19] my own instructions. That's what a lot
[1:16:22] of people felt when the prophet of God,
[1:16:24] oh, he had all the healing ministry and
[1:16:27] all the supernatural and all the
[1:16:28] miracles and then finally he starts more
[1:16:31] and more saying, "Thus sayaeth the Lord,
[1:16:34] thus sayeth the Lord." And they needed
[1:16:36] to find a way to circumvent that. And I
[1:16:39] even read one of them. They said that uh
[1:16:41] you know that brother Brandham was he
[1:16:44] was just precise. He was right. of all
[1:16:46] the thousands of times he never missed
[1:16:48] once when he told the people uh the
[1:16:51] secret of their heart. But but don't
[1:16:54] hear him when he comes to the word.
[1:16:56] Well, that is the word.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; That is the word that was speaking.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; And he just couldn't fathom how
[1:17:03] theologians and wise men could could
[1:17:06] break the system. In other words, they
[1:17:09] say this is right. The instructions now
[1:17:12] are right. The word is absolutely
[1:17:14] divine. But when it comes to the word,
[1:17:16] don't agree with it because they already
[1:17:19] had all of they had all of their things
[1:17:21] all figured out and they had a different
[1:17:24] set of instructions. And I'm here to say
[1:17:26] to you and they didn't get the result.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't follow the
[1:17:32] instructions, you won't have the result.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; I find people in the message. I find
[1:17:40] people in the message. This isn't rocket
[1:17:42] science, friends. This is just
[1:17:44] simplicity. And the word of God is so
[1:17:47] simple for their life, but they don't
[1:17:50] want to do it. And they look around say,
[1:17:52] "Well, I'd like to have his life. I'd
[1:17:54] like to have her life." All you need to
[1:17:56] do is do the same thing and you'll have
[1:17:58] that life.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Because God is no respector of person.
[1:18:03] If you do what they do, you'll have the
[1:18:05] same result.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we had such a beautiful
[1:18:10] example in our Lord Jesus Christ, a
[1:18:12] perfect example and a wonderful example
[1:18:15] in the messenger. And and and you know
[1:18:18] this is really a surprising thing but
[1:18:21] I'm going to just say some things
[1:18:23] absolutely truthful. I've told brethren
[1:18:25] that have had responsibility within the
[1:18:27] church. I said whenever the the first
[1:18:30] responsibility of a pastor is to see she
[1:18:33] see that the sheep are not distressed.
[1:18:37] If the sheep get distressed, if you're
[1:18:39] distressed because the word is preached,
[1:18:41] well, that's something you can't do
[1:18:42] anything about. But if if something is
[1:18:45] taking place in the church and the sheep
[1:18:47] get distressed, and I I I've written
[1:18:50] emails and sent word and just said the
[1:18:53] responsibility of the shepherd is to do
[1:18:56] everything in his power to see that the
[1:18:58] sheep aren't distressed. And if
[1:19:01] something comes in and starts to float
[1:19:03] through the church or something and it
[1:19:06] you see the people get unsettled or
[1:19:08] something, I've always gone back to the
[1:19:10] message
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; to find out what the prophet messenger
[1:19:16] because I always felt that that was the
[1:19:18] example
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; and and a good example is is the is the
[1:19:22] music for example. Sometimes you you
[1:19:24] know everybody's taste is different.
[1:19:27] someone like this kind of music, someone
[1:19:29] likes another kind of music, someone
[1:19:30] likes, you know, something else. But and
[1:19:33] then uh and and with some people, I
[1:19:36] mean, they just say, "Well, I just can't
[1:19:37] stand that. It just irritates me,
[1:19:40] whatever more." But if I go back, I
[1:19:43] always like to put my back against the
[1:19:45] message.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; And then when I hear the prophet say, "I
[1:19:48] I love those old songs." Well, it wasn't
[1:19:51] it wasn't because he was old. Some of
[1:19:53] those songs were brother Brandham was
[1:19:56] only 56. He was in his 40s and his he
[1:19:59] he's a youthful man who said I love
[1:20:02] those old songs because it wasn't the
[1:20:04] song. It wasn't the melody. It was what
[1:20:07] the word said.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I love I love those
[1:20:11] songs that that speak about it is well
[1:20:14] with my soul.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; My sin not the part but the whole. I
[1:20:19] like the words of those songs. draw me
[1:20:21] nearer, nearer, nearer. And how many
[1:20:23] times he says, "We're here to get nearer
[1:20:26] to God." And my soul says, "Yay, amen. I
[1:20:29] want to get nearer to God." Oh, blessed
[1:20:32] be the fountain. Blessed assurance,
[1:20:35] Jesus is mine. And I like to put my back
[1:20:38] against that. You know, a lot of the
[1:20:39] songs today are generic. They don't even
[1:20:42] talk about Jesus and the blood and the
[1:20:44] cross and those things because they want
[1:20:46] to find a a a a a they want to find a
[1:20:50] popular place in the broader community
[1:20:53] of called Christianity and it's called
[1:20:56] contemporary. I'm not interested in
[1:20:58] contemporary. I'm interested in the
[1:21:00] oldfashioned gospel of Jesus Christ. I'm
[1:21:03] just interested and that might just be
[1:21:05] me. But but and yet I I like a beat. I
[1:21:08] like rhythm. I'm made for it. Now, I
[1:21:10] played guitar and I like those what they
[1:21:13] call hot licks and all those things, but
[1:21:15] I wouldn't get in front of the church
[1:21:16] and do it. I just, you know, because it
[1:21:18] might stumble or offend somebody, but at
[1:21:20] home I I might just play it.
[1:21:23] Unfortunately, don't get to play very
[1:21:25] often anymore, but uh I I like rhythm. I
[1:21:28] like movement. I I see some of these
[1:21:30] people, I go over to over into Africa
[1:21:33] and and I see them dancing around. I
[1:21:35] thought I I look at them, I say, "Man, I
[1:21:37] wish I could do that.
[1:21:40] I just wish I could just get feeling so
[1:21:42] free. And and I I'll never forget down
[1:21:44] in Cape Town once and the people began
[1:21:47] to rejoice. I believe it was brother
[1:21:48] Eddie Layman. He's gone on to be with
[1:21:50] the Lord now. I think they were singing
[1:21:51] this is the day. This is the day. This
[1:21:54] is the day that the Lord hath made. And
[1:21:55] there was two fellows. One was about 10.
[1:21:57] There were two brothers. One was about
[1:21:59] 10. One was about 12. And they just got
[1:22:01] lost. I mean, they were just lost in
[1:22:03] God. They were singing. They were
[1:22:04] rejoicing. They both just moved out and
[1:22:06] danced out in front of all the people.
[1:22:08] But they they weren't they didn't care
[1:22:10] about anybody.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; They were just enjoying it.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; You want to do it that way, that's fine
[1:22:16] with me.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; That won't bother me at all. But when it
[1:22:20] comes down to our, you know, to our uh
[1:22:24] our our conviction and our redemption,
[1:22:27] and I like to sing about it. I like to
[1:22:29] rejoice about it.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; And so the token must be applied
[1:22:36] precisely as this is commanded. We have
[1:22:39] to follow the instructions.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; And this is a bleeding word today. So
[1:22:45] many want to take the message and just
[1:22:47] pick and choose what suits them. We
[1:22:50] don't want to do that.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; We want to. So you're saying, "Well,
[1:22:54] where are you going, brother Ed?" Well,
[1:22:56] I'll tell you where I'm going to be
[1:22:57] going in the future. I want to look at
[1:23:01] certain aspects, certain things and say
[1:23:05] this is what the word of God says.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; This is what the messenger has said. And
[1:23:11] I got news for you. This is what works.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Nothing else works. This is what works.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; A lot of times, a lot of times it runs
[1:23:22] in real conflict with the flesh.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; And we all have trouble. I don't have to
[1:23:29] worry about you. I have my own flesh to
[1:23:32] worry about. And to make this man do
[1:23:35] what it's supposed to do is not easy.
[1:23:38] Sometimes it's a very difficult thing.
[1:23:41] But I know in my heart it's the right
[1:23:43] thing to do. Sometimes it just kills you
[1:23:46] and it needs to kill you.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; You need to die when it happens.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; I'm really thankful to have as much
[1:23:55] response as I'm having. I thought it was
[1:23:56] going to be awfully quiet here,
[1:23:59] brother.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, the token must be on
[1:24:05] display, visible for all to see. It's
[1:24:08] not something that we just did and
[1:24:10] generated in our minds.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; It's not something we think about.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; It's not something we learn about.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; It's something that we do.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; We don't say, "Well, we have to learn
[1:24:22] more things." And you know, we could get
[1:24:24] the instructions of of a certain product
[1:24:27] and say, "Well, I think I'll go on
[1:24:29] Google and find out what the world
[1:24:31] thinks about it or I'll find out what
[1:24:32] somebody else thinks or I'll find about
[1:24:34] those that used it." I'm, you know, I'm
[1:24:36] not opposed to that. But when it comes
[1:24:38] to the word of God, we don't have to go
[1:24:41] searching around see, well, what do you
[1:24:42] think about it or what do you think
[1:24:44] about it? God's already said what he
[1:24:46] thinks about it.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; When God speaks it, we don't have to go
[1:24:49] asking for someone else's opinion. say,
[1:24:52] "Well, I heard it." Okay, now I'll get
[1:24:54] someone else's opinion about what I
[1:24:56] heard. And brother Brandham has said in
[1:24:58] one place, I've got the quote here,
[1:25:00] "You've heard enough."
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus couldn't have said it any clearer.
[1:25:08] He said it very clear.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; And when the Holy Spirit came into the
[1:25:12] church and they said, "Men, brethren,
[1:25:15] what must we do to be saved?" Yes.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Well, now we'll go
[1:25:20] through great dis dissertation here
[1:25:22] about what you must do." It was just one
[1:25:24] word. Repent.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's hard on the flesh.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; But repent.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Turn around. Have a change of mind.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And be baptized.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; And you shall be filled with the Holy
[1:25:41] Ghost.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:44] Now, in the token message, I've got a
[1:25:47] number of quotes from the token message.
[1:25:49] The lamb was killed in the evening time.
[1:25:52] Not somebody say, "Well, I think I'll do
[1:25:53] mine in the morning because I'm going to
[1:25:55] be busy tonight."
[1:26:00] It'll be killed in the evening time and
[1:26:03] kept up for 14 days. And then the lamb
[1:26:05] was killed and the blood was applied in
[1:26:09] the evening time. Now, this has special
[1:26:12] significance to us. I trust I'm able to
[1:26:14] get it across. Special significance
[1:26:16] because the token message.
[1:26:20] I don't know if any of the other
[1:26:21] messengers or people or apostles
[1:26:24] preached on the token message,
[1:26:27] but
[1:26:28] if you take and I would I would actually
[1:26:31] ask that you would get the token message
[1:26:34] and read it after this service because
[1:26:37] we have more services coming. But the
[1:26:40] token had to be applied in the evening
[1:26:43] time. And to me, it's very significant
[1:26:46] that God who ordained Moses to come and
[1:26:49] one of the first things he does is
[1:26:52] institute the Passover and apply the
[1:26:56] blood. You must apply this. In other
[1:26:59] words, their life changed.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; They were physically doing things they
[1:27:03] had not done.
[1:27:04] I've never gone out to my sheep, to my
[1:27:06] little flock, and picked the best to
[1:27:09] kill it. I've never done that. And to
[1:27:11] put the blood on the doorpost of my what
[1:27:14] are my neighbors? What are the people
[1:27:15] going to think? I've never done that
[1:27:17] before. But now they're doing something
[1:27:19] different because a prophet said so. And
[1:27:23] that's the only thing they had was what
[1:27:24] he said.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Well, he said it
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; and I did it. And then they and then
[1:27:30] that that presentation that they did, it
[1:27:32] was, you know, the son, the eldest son.
[1:27:35] Are you sure? And brother Brandon goes
[1:27:37] through it. Are you sure? Father, daddy,
[1:27:39] are you sure? Are we sure? Cuz I am your
[1:27:42] eldest. And the eldest is going to die
[1:27:44] if it is not done right. The only thing
[1:27:46] he could hang on, he had to hang
[1:27:49] everything, his household and everything
[1:27:51] on what that messenger said. And to me,
[1:27:54] it's very significant that in this end
[1:27:56] time came another token message by a
[1:28:00] messenger who said, "This is a bleeding
[1:28:02] word." Now, I've never heard anybody
[1:28:05] say, "This is a bleeding word." The word
[1:28:07] is bleeding because he said that because
[1:28:10] the word is Christ.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; This message is another doctrine,
[1:28:14] friends. This message isn't what the
[1:28:16] Pentecostal, the Baptist, the
[1:28:18] Presbyterians. We don't we we're not
[1:28:20] interested what anyone else says. We
[1:28:22] have a thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; We have a proven message
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; and a proven messenger. We're going to
[1:28:30] give an account if we have a
[1:28:31] disagreement with his. We're going to
[1:28:33] give an account at the judgment
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; over the thousands of times that God
[1:28:39] spoke through his mouth and revealed the
[1:28:42] secrets of the heart. And God is going
[1:28:44] to say, in fact is God doesn't have to
[1:28:46] say anything. We're going to stand there
[1:28:47] naked. I trusted. I don't plan to be
[1:28:50] there by God's grace because if there's
[1:28:52] anything I love, I love I I love that
[1:28:55] vindication. Why? Because the
[1:28:57] vindication was beyond a human.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; It wasn't William Brandham.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; He was only a vessel.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; He just a vessel of clay.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; He's a sinner b born in sin
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; and saved by grace.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; But God spoke through him. Amen.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; And we can't even dispute. I don't have
[1:29:21] to substantiate that, you know, any more
[1:29:24] than I have to stand here and say the
[1:29:25] rock of Gibralar is steadfast. I don't
[1:29:28] have to say that. It is what it is
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; and he is what he is.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; And we are what we are.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; We've been called here for this season.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; I I trusted this will be a a
[1:29:41] life-changing message for you.
[1:29:44] And he said the token never come into
[1:29:46] existence until the evening time.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; It could only come into existence in the
[1:29:52] evening time. It they had an evening
[1:29:54] then and you'll kill the lamb in the
[1:29:57] evening. You'll spread to put the blood
[1:29:59] and you'll stray it on the door. You're
[1:30:02] not just doing this, you know, in some
[1:30:04] uh haphazard
[1:30:06] casual way. You're going to take that
[1:30:09] basin of blood. You're going to take
[1:30:10] that hissup and you know that this is
[1:30:12] life or death and I'm going to put it on
[1:30:15] the doorpost and make sure that it's
[1:30:17] visible and make sure that everybody can
[1:30:20] see it. I'm going to do with all my zeal
[1:30:22] and all my energy. God's prophet said
[1:30:25] it. I'm going to do it.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Applying it.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; And the blood was applied in the evening
[1:30:34] time.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Said this is evening time for the
[1:30:37] church. Amen.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; This is the evening time for me. He
[1:30:41] said,
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; This is the evening time of my message.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; He's placing it right in time, friends.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; It was evening time that the message
[1:30:52] came.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Evening time. Brother Bren says,
[1:30:54] "Evening time for my life." And in 24
[1:30:57] months, he's gone.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; He knew it was evening time
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; and he was dealing with it as seriously.
[1:31:05] This is the evening time of my message.
[1:31:07] She says, "I'm dying.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going. I'm moving out in the evening
[1:31:13] time of the gospel."
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Have you heard those things before?
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; I'm moving out.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; In the evening time, that's why he was
[1:31:23] approaching it with such a seriousness.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "In the evening time, the
[1:31:30] message is to apply."
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; The evening time message.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Hear it. The evening time message is to
[1:31:38] apply
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; the token.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; We hear that word. It's not a phrase,
[1:31:42] apply the token. It's a life.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; It's something we do.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; It's not something we hear Sunday
[1:31:50] morning, Wednesdays, or whenever. We do
[1:31:52] it. Our life is changed. Amen.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; And it keeps changing because we keep
[1:31:59] hearing
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; the word.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; The applied word or the applied token
[1:32:06] for this hour
[1:32:08] is the very identification.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; That you are accepted in the beloved.
[1:32:16] It didn't it wasn't an examination of
[1:32:18] the man and what he had done or the
[1:32:21] woman of the house or whether they had
[1:32:23] maybe just had the biggest fight they
[1:32:26] ever had.
[1:32:30] When he put that blood on the door,
[1:32:33] God had said, "I'll pass over that
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; when I see the blood."
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Not when I've examined you and looked
[1:32:41] you over thoroughly or the house or how
[1:32:43] it happens. When I see the blood, when I
[1:32:47] see the blood, not your blood, but the
[1:32:50] bleeding word. When I see the word, I'll
[1:32:53] pass over you.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Is that God's word?
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Should this people rejoice over that
[1:33:01] one?
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; You're never going to make your flesh
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; acceptable to God. It's when he sees
[1:33:11] what you believe and what your desire is
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; that he accepts you.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; When I see the blood, I'll pass over
[1:33:19] you.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; There isn't anything in this world,
[1:33:24] friends. There isn't anything in this
[1:33:25] world can make you acceptable in the
[1:33:28] sight of God.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Three things.
[1:33:36] And this is paragraph 26.
[1:33:40] He said, "Notice God's preparation for
[1:33:42] the time."
[1:33:46] First thing he done to his people was
[1:33:50] send a prophet with a message.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; That was first. We're reading the
[1:33:55] instructions now
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; for application.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; The next thing he done was to identify
[1:34:03] this prophet.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. to send a pillar of fire for
[1:34:07] identification to identify it.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; So, we're sitting here today.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; I'm just asking you now. We've got a
[1:34:14] lesson.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Are you satisfied?
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; I know you are. You're satisfied. This
[1:34:20] is a a word prophet.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; You're satisfied with that?
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Everybody satisfied?
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:31] Are you satisfied
[1:34:33] that that pillar of fire, you've seen
[1:34:36] the picture, you've seen the angels of
[1:34:39] the Lord, you've seen pictures of
[1:34:41] Houston,
[1:34:43] you've heard him say, "He's here."
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; All of those things accumulated.
[1:34:48] Are we satisfied as a congregation?
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; That the message has been identified
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; by the pillar of fire.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Say friends, we've come up the ladder.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:00] Hallelujah.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Then we're satisfied that what he says
[1:35:05] and what what what he speaks is God
[1:35:09] speaking to us.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; God instructing us.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; We're this is not a man. Now we're
[1:35:16] satisfied. We're following through the
[1:35:18] instruction for application.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; And now are we satisfied then that when
[1:35:23] he said this is a bleeding word. Are you
[1:35:26] all satisfied on the pl on the up in the
[1:35:29] balcony? Are we all satisfied? This is a
[1:35:32] bleeding word. Then I say to you that is
[1:35:35] the blood.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; You don't have any other blood.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; There is no animal. There is no bird, no
[1:35:42] human blood. This is the blood. There's
[1:35:45] no other book that bleeds.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; There's no other word that bleeds.
[1:35:50] There's nothing in chapters or indigo or
[1:35:52] any other place. There's nothing on
[1:35:54] Amazon that bleeds.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; This word bleeds.
[1:36:00] [Applause]
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; This word was crucified again.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. This is blood.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; And if you apply it,
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; apply it.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; It will it will give you the results.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; To deny it is death.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; I'm confident of that. to deny the word.
[1:36:24] That's why I tremble.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; It's a simple thing.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; I sit in an office or I speak to
[1:36:29] somebody or send them an email and say,
[1:36:32] "This is what the messenger said." He
[1:36:34] said, "Well, this brother Brown said
[1:36:36] this, you so and well, we maybe see it a
[1:36:38] different way or someone else." You be
[1:36:41] careful you see it as he sees it.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; You don't have to say it as I see it,
[1:36:47] but see it as he sees it
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; and do what he said. Not hear what he
[1:36:51] says. do what he said.
[1:36:53] [Applause]
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; We've heard enough.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; We've heard even more than enough.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; We need to do
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; what he says.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; And the third thing he sent was the
[1:37:13] token. The first thing, the first thing
[1:37:15] he did was send him a prophet.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; The second thing he did back then and
[1:37:20] today, was to send the vindication that
[1:37:24] what the prophet said was the truth
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; and that the pillar of fire was in
[1:37:28] attendance. So now we're agreed we have
[1:37:30] a prophet. We're all agreed that it was
[1:37:33] a vindication message by the presence of
[1:37:36] almighty God by the supernatural. And
[1:37:39] then the third thing is that he sent a
[1:37:41] token. He sent something to the people
[1:37:44] that they they could do but they could
[1:37:47] not bring the result for themselves. In
[1:37:50] other words, the I if they applied the
[1:37:54] if they applied the instructions
[1:37:56] absolutely correctly, then the death
[1:37:58] angel passed over them.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; God did not require that they attain
[1:38:03] some great height or achievement.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; He just said, "If you'll do this," and
[1:38:08] he put it within anybody's grasp,
[1:38:10] everybody's grasp. There isn't anybody
[1:38:12] here, you can't say to me, "I can't do
[1:38:15] it."
[1:38:18] There isn't anybody that can say I can't
[1:38:20] do it
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; because it's just hissup.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Are you a common man, a common woman?
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; We're just common.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; This message is to us.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; You can do it.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; I can do it.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; It's hard sometimes. Sometimes it's a
[1:38:35] struggle to get this flesh to subject
[1:38:38] itself. And that's where the problem is.
[1:38:40] To get this flesh to say, "Yes,
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; I will do it. Amen.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; So, he sent a token to get under this
[1:38:55] blood and he and he'd accepted this
[1:38:59] substitute death in your place.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; And then the blood was a token
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; that he looked at at you that's heard
[1:39:06] the message,
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; believed on the pillar of fire.
[1:39:10] You've heard the message
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; and believed on the pillar of fire
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; and had accepted the substitutionary
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; that he had provided for you and you
[1:39:19] were under the blood of the very
[1:39:21] chemistry of the life that went out for
[1:39:23] you.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; God. Amen.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; How are we going to pay for how are we
[1:39:28] ever going to pay for how could we what
[1:39:31] could we do in this life
[1:39:34] to hear the words
[1:39:40] prophet
[1:39:42] vindicated.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Pillar, fire, presence.
[1:39:48] We see it.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; And now we have him say,
[1:39:53] "But you didn't do it in the first
[1:39:55] place."
[1:39:57] I tell you what, when I first read those
[1:39:59] words, it was a real tough one for me
[1:40:02] because there's something in the human
[1:40:03] psyche that, you know, we want to,
[1:40:07] you know, make ourselves responsible or
[1:40:09] we want to make ourselves
[1:40:12] guilty in a way. We want to make
[1:40:14] ourselves,
[1:40:16] you know, so we're held responsible.
[1:40:18] There's one thing that you can't be
[1:40:20] responsible for, and that is for your
[1:40:22] your total justification. You can't be,
[1:40:26] you can't justify yourself.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; You can't glorify yourself. You can't
[1:40:31] resurrect yourself. You can't do those
[1:40:34] things any more than any more than the
[1:40:37] children of Israel could. We could say
[1:40:38] to them, "Save yourself."
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; They couldn't save themselves.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; But just the shedding of blood saved
[1:40:45] them from the number one power of the
[1:40:48] earth at the time, the superpower we
[1:40:50] could say, which was Egypt.
[1:40:57] Okay. The token message.
[1:41:08] I think this little phrase, these are
[1:41:10] phrases that are not difficult for you.
[1:41:13] Apply as instructed.
[1:41:17] You must read and follow all these
[1:41:19] instructions before using.
[1:41:22] I just took that off of
[1:41:24] some product. I don't even know what it
[1:41:26] was.
[1:41:28] You must you you you've read it.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; I see you smiling. You're all you're all
[1:41:33] in the basket with me.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; You must and if that is on some solution
[1:41:38] or some glue or something else, surely
[1:41:43] it applies to this.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; You must read and follow all instruction
[1:41:48] before using a person.
[1:41:50] You know we can we all have been in
[1:41:52] these places.
[1:41:54] Now
[1:41:55] I want to just be at at a very very
[1:41:58] simple level.
[1:42:06] You can read some instructions
[1:42:09] before you apply. Read these
[1:42:11] instructions.
[1:42:13] So you come each Sunday morning and you
[1:42:16] say, "We're going to hear something more
[1:42:17] about the instructions.
[1:42:20] We're going to hear more instructions,
[1:42:22] but we didn't do last week, but it
[1:42:24] doesn't make any difference. We just I
[1:42:25] just want to hear more."
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, we got a special speaker and he's
[1:42:30] going to give us the instructions from a
[1:42:32] different angle, from his perspective.
[1:42:35] Oh, it's going to be wonderful. Oh, it
[1:42:37] make us so happy. Oh, I heard how these
[1:42:39] instructions have worked for people in
[1:42:41] China and worked for people elsewhere.
[1:42:44] Work for We get all enthused about it.
[1:42:46] We hear how Brother Gary Walker, you
[1:42:49] know, we say, "Oh, isn't it wonderful?"
[1:42:52] And and we just heard the testimony. I I
[1:42:55] can't be the same person. But I was
[1:42:58] talking to brother Tom, talking to my
[1:43:00] wife. How many How many have the Brother
[1:43:03] Gary Walker's book, The Testimony? All
[1:43:06] right. You want to get it?
[1:43:10] He told me one of the most difficult
[1:43:12] times was when he was in therapy.
[1:43:16] You know what is difficult about
[1:43:17] therapy? You have to do certain things.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; If you don't do it, and that's why the
[1:43:25] nurses and the therapists and whatever
[1:43:27] more say, you got to stand up. Stand up.
[1:43:30] Stand up.
[1:43:32] Move your arm. Move your fingers. Do
[1:43:35] something. Brother Gary told me that if
[1:43:40] he could move
[1:43:42] in the months that he was in therapy, he
[1:43:45] struggled with everything that was in
[1:43:47] his being to move his foot a half inch
[1:43:51] further than he had moved it the day
[1:43:52] before
[1:43:55] and move it a half inch. That's one day.
[1:43:59] Come back the next day. stand there and
[1:44:02] hang on to those rails and try and do
[1:44:05] everything to move the foot a half inch,
[1:44:08] half inch,
[1:44:10] week after week and month after month.
[1:44:13] So, we see him come up here and stand
[1:44:15] and open up the Bible and oh, I just
[1:44:18] rejoicing just a second. We all ought to
[1:44:20] go back there.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; We all ought to been back there because
[1:44:24] you can't really taste what it is
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; until you've been through it. And
[1:44:28] sometime we have here we are in strong
[1:44:30] healthy bodies and we we all we have to
[1:44:32] do is make our way to the service and
[1:44:35] and it's such a struggle and oh come on
[1:44:38] folks
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; are you with me? You understand what I'm
[1:44:41] saying? It's not difficult to come to
[1:44:44] church. It's not difficult to be here.
[1:44:46] It's not difficult to apply apply what
[1:44:48] God said when he when he and he he gives
[1:44:51] our life you know he gives instructions
[1:44:53] for our life. It's not for our
[1:44:55] detriment. It's for your benefit.
[1:44:58] there's a blessing coming in behind it.
[1:45:00] And then the denominational world got in
[1:45:02] behind it on giving. One of my one of
[1:45:05] the sessions will be on giving. I won't
[1:45:06] tell which one. So, make sure
[1:45:08] everybody's here.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; But there's a promise on giving.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; If you give, it'll be given back to you.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; There's a promise with tithing. There's
[1:45:21] a promise with giving. There's a promise
[1:45:23] with offerings. There's a promise with
[1:45:24] all that. But then the denomination
[1:45:26] world got on it and talked all about the
[1:45:28] promises. Oh, you'll be blessed. You'll
[1:45:30] be blessed. That's not the idea.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; The idea is God said it. The pillar of
[1:45:36] fire vindicated it. He said a prophet
[1:45:38] and this is the bleeding word. And I
[1:45:40] just do it.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; I do it whether I get anything in return
[1:45:44] or not. I just do it because it may not
[1:45:47] come back materially. It may come back
[1:45:50] in health. It may come back in family.
[1:45:52] It may come back in relationships. It
[1:45:55] may come back a thousand ways.
[1:45:57] [Applause]
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; It may just come back that you feel
[1:46:00] wonderful every day. You feel encouraged
[1:46:03] every day and God has drove back that
[1:46:06] devil of discouragement and held it away
[1:46:08] from you and you don't even know about
[1:46:10] it. You just feel wonderful.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; It might be because you were just
[1:46:15] giving. You're just tithing, doing what
[1:46:17] God said to do. He said, "Just do it
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; and you'll be blessed for it."
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:25] Right.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; That's just one small one.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; And then you hear it.
[1:46:36] You hear some instructions. You don't
[1:46:38] need to go and research it.
[1:46:41] Well, I think I'll research it and see
[1:46:42] if there's a a different way that we can
[1:46:45] approach it.
[1:46:47] You can read the testimonials and the
[1:46:49] successes and the reports of what the
[1:46:52] product has done or done for others
[1:46:57] and you can hear about that it's
[1:47:00] absolutely true
[1:47:02] but that doesn't do anything for you.
[1:47:05] You know it's us that need to do it.
[1:47:07] Amen.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Paul said in Corinthians,
[1:47:14] "But we preach Christ crucified.
[1:47:18] Unto the Jews it's a stumbling block and
[1:47:21] unto the Greeks it's foolishness." And
[1:47:24] he didn't come up with another phrase
[1:47:25] and say, "Well, then what's the use?"
[1:47:28] It's just foolishness to these people
[1:47:30] and it's just, you know, uh, what do he
[1:47:34] say? It's a stumbling block to some and
[1:47:35] it's foolishness to others. But we
[1:47:38] preach Christ. He didn't say we preach
[1:47:42] about Christ.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; We preached about his background. We
[1:47:47] preached about all the types. We
[1:47:49] preached about all the beauty and the
[1:47:51] types. We we bring it from all angles.
[1:47:55] We preach about the conditions of his
[1:47:57] time. No, we preach Christ. We just
[1:48:00] preach the word. Amen.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; And then it's up to the people what they
[1:48:04] do with the word.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; In Philippians, he said, "Some indeed
[1:48:08] preach Christ even of envy and strife,
[1:48:12] and some also of good will." So here
[1:48:15] here's Paul writing. He's saying, "Well,
[1:48:17] some preach Christ to envy and some
[1:48:20] preach Christ uh of strife, but and some
[1:48:24] also of good will." So he's saying this
[1:48:28] isn't affecting us. what what this one
[1:48:31] does or what that one does. Somebody
[1:48:33] says, "Oh, well, the message church in
[1:48:34] Toronto is this or the message church in
[1:48:37] Phoenix or in Dallas or in some other
[1:48:40] place." It's not up to us to say what
[1:48:43] they are doing because it's Christ. This
[1:48:47] is simple and I keep going back over it.
[1:48:50] We are We are convinced. We're convinced
[1:48:55] God sent a prophet. were convinced that
[1:48:59] the pillar of fire was in attendance
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; and were convinced he gave a message in
[1:49:04] utter simplicity.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; The applying there's two or three words.
[1:49:14] I'm not going to keep you late but
[1:49:17] there's two or three words that are used
[1:49:20] in the used in the scripture and used in
[1:49:22] our English language. We can say
[1:49:25] applying or the word that I was using
[1:49:28] first appropriating
[1:49:31] appropriating the word and brother
[1:49:33] Brandham refers to that to appropriate
[1:49:35] faith. It's not that faith isn't here
[1:49:37] but to appropriate the the promise is
[1:49:40] here. And then another word is
[1:49:42] comprehending and I want to connect
[1:49:43] these two together for you in just a
[1:49:46] couple of minutes. Now, so when the
[1:49:49] Hebrew said uh the Hebrew scripture said
[1:49:52] strike the doorpost and that is to put
[1:49:56] it upon to set it,
[1:50:00] you know, there was there's no other
[1:50:02] explanation for it. You just put it on
[1:50:04] there. A man had to take his energy, had
[1:50:08] to take his lamb, had to follow the
[1:50:12] instructions and put it on. and the
[1:50:15] death angel passed. So many references
[1:50:20] uh we hear the references all the time
[1:50:22] to apply the blood. The word applied is
[1:50:25] doesn't appear there but it is it was to
[1:50:28] forcefully strike it on.
[1:50:31] Now in Matthew's gospel
[1:50:34] Jesus tells an account
[1:50:37] and we believe his words are true.
[1:50:40] He's speaking to you and I.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Not everyone that saith
[1:50:44] unto me, Lord, Lord." So it's not what
[1:50:46] we say.
[1:50:48] We may be here declaring, "Lord, Lord, I
[1:50:50] love you.
[1:50:54] I believe your word with all that's
[1:50:56] within me."
[1:51:00] We have to be careful
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; because I've seen a great weakness
[1:51:05] within the message and I'm trying to
[1:51:07] deal with it.
[1:51:09] Not just here, but within the message
[1:51:13] where people they will they will declare
[1:51:15] emphatic they're ready to die. Brother
[1:51:18] Bam was God's prophet.
[1:51:22] Do you believe the Do you believe that
[1:51:25] he stood before the people and you
[1:51:26] believe that when the secret of their
[1:51:28] hearts were revealed it was God?
[1:51:30] Absolutely.
[1:51:32] Absolutely.
[1:51:36] And they will come to a place
[1:51:39] and they hear what the message is
[1:51:41] saying. And everybody has something
[1:51:43] different. You know, it might be with
[1:51:45] some with their work, it might be others
[1:51:47] with their finances, it might be with
[1:51:49] others with their relationships, might
[1:51:51] be with others with their family or it
[1:51:54] could be a whole lot of things,
[1:51:56] different things. And but there comes a
[1:51:59] place and we need each one. Each person
[1:52:02] needs to focus on that one area that
[1:52:05] gives us some difficulty.
[1:52:09] And we want to say if we want to build a
[1:52:12] real
[1:52:14] successful life, we need to say I will
[1:52:17] do it.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; It's just that simple. I will do it.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; And the mind will go into reasoning
[1:52:24] right away. Well, you can't do it.
[1:52:26] you'll be looked on this way or you'll
[1:52:27] be looked on that way or you can't do it
[1:52:30] financially because of this because of
[1:52:32] that or you can't do it because they'll
[1:52:34] think that you're weak or for all kinds
[1:52:36] of reasons and the mind is so active
[1:52:39] will go into it or what will my friends
[1:52:41] think.
[1:52:45] I know I I I I
[1:52:48] relate to young men a lot because when I
[1:52:51] see you and I shake hands with you, I
[1:52:52] immediately put myself back when I was
[1:52:54] about your age.
[1:52:58] And uh
[1:53:00] I remember very clearly, you know, some
[1:53:05] real smart dressers.
[1:53:08] I was working in a store and I was
[1:53:10] selling clothes and I was kind of
[1:53:13] conscious. I wanted to, you know, to
[1:53:14] appear right because I was before the
[1:53:16] people and and these three fellas that
[1:53:20] came into town and they,
[1:53:24] you know, they were stylish, real
[1:53:26] stylish. They had the narrow pants at
[1:53:29] that time, zoot suitors with the big
[1:53:30] chain. They're all going back to it
[1:53:32] about now, you know.
[1:53:36] And I'm just seeing reruns actually.
[1:53:44] And they were about my size and they
[1:53:46] were about my age. And hey, you know, I
[1:53:49] had a I had a free going conversation
[1:53:52] with them and all the rest of it. But
[1:53:54] there was always this twinge. And this
[1:53:56] is what I want to say to you. Every one
[1:53:58] of you that are here in this church and
[1:54:01] have listened to this message, if you
[1:54:03] will just stop for a moment, way deep
[1:54:05] down there's an inner witness.
[1:54:10] And when you go to do something,
[1:54:13] even though your friends and everybody
[1:54:14] else is doing it, there's a little
[1:54:16] something down here saying, you know,
[1:54:19] you know, it's not for you,
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; And so I didn't I didn't preach to these
[1:54:27] guys and say, "Oh, you guys are rotten.
[1:54:28] You're going to hell." No, I I was
[1:54:31] friendly with them. They were good
[1:54:33] friends, but they wanted me to, you
[1:54:34] know, well, participate in this and
[1:54:36] participate in that. Then I found out
[1:54:38] later that's just when drugs were coming
[1:54:39] in and these boys were taking it
[1:54:44] into town moved some young ladies and
[1:54:47] they were out, you know, and their their
[1:54:49] their their swingers, their shakers and
[1:54:51] movers and all the rest of it, you know,
[1:54:53] and and uh would try to start up a
[1:54:57] conversation with me because I was in
[1:54:58] the store. But my conversations with
[1:55:01] them were very very limited. Not because
[1:55:03] I was some big hero. I wasn't a
[1:55:04] preacher. I was I was I was one of you.
[1:55:07] But there was something inside that just
[1:55:09] said,
[1:55:11] you know, I'm not of that. I don't have
[1:55:15] that.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; And then a friend of mine from school d
[1:55:18] I'm just giving a whole bunch. I got a
[1:55:20] car and he got a car and he pulled up
[1:55:22] beside pulled up beside me says I'll
[1:55:24] drag you. Well, you know, the flesh was
[1:55:27] like, "Yeah." You know, but there just I
[1:55:31] thought, "What do I want to drag him
[1:55:33] for?" There wasn't anything in here. I
[1:55:35] didn't I didn't have any interest in
[1:55:36] dragging him. I might have been able to
[1:55:38] win. I don't know. I did a lot of silly
[1:55:40] things, but but I'm just telling you
[1:55:43] that there's an inner witness. You have
[1:55:44] it.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; You actually have it.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; And then when you get older, the inner
[1:55:50] witness will say, you know, oh, here's a
[1:55:53] here is a magnificent opportunity
[1:55:58] for you.
[1:56:01] and you're going to go places and you're
[1:56:03] going to earn this and you're going to
[1:56:04] this is where you're going to end up.
[1:56:06] You're going to end up on top of the
[1:56:08] stack,
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; but deep down inside
[1:56:13] there's a little witness
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; that says that's not for you.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; That's not the direction.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; It's not mom or dad or the church or the
[1:56:22] preacher, the prophet or anybody else.
[1:56:24] It's the Holy Spirit in you.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Giving you a witness. Amen.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; He's protecting you.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; This is the blessing of God.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; And might be on the other hand, it'll be
[1:56:37] the other way. Say, "Go for it. Go.
[1:56:39] You'll I I got something in I got
[1:56:42] something for you in this direction."
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Can I take just a couple more minutes?
[1:56:49] But five minutes.
[1:56:52] So Jesus said,
[1:56:55] "Not everyone that says unto me, Lord,
[1:56:56] Lord, but but he that doeth the will of
[1:57:00] my father which is in heaven." And many
[1:57:03] will say to me in that day, Lord, have
[1:57:05] we not prophesied in th name? Didn't I
[1:57:07] go to church? Didn't I go to Cloverdale
[1:57:09] Bible way in thy name? Didn't I sing the
[1:57:11] songs? And didn't I do all the things?
[1:57:14] But he says uh in my name and cast out
[1:57:17] devils and in my name done many
[1:57:19] wonderful works and then I will profess
[1:57:20] unto them I never knew you. That's the
[1:57:23] secret of the relationship. See depart
[1:57:25] from me excuse me you that work
[1:57:27] iniquity. Therefore
[1:57:30] whosoever heareth these sayings of mine
[1:57:35] and doeth them, I will liken him unto a
[1:57:38] man a wise man which built a house upon
[1:57:40] a rock. And the rain descended and the
[1:57:43] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[1:57:45] upon that house.
[1:57:48] Oh my,
[1:57:50] the all all the things happened. Maybe
[1:57:54] sickness came and maybe accidents came
[1:57:57] and and financial meltdowns came and the
[1:58:00] loss of this and the loss of that and it
[1:58:03] blew upon the house and and it fell not
[1:58:06] for it was founded upon a rock. What was
[1:58:09] the rock? It was simply hearing and
[1:58:11] doing.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; That's all it was. The rock was simply
[1:58:14] hearing and doing. Not only hearing, but
[1:58:17] hearing and doing. That combination. And
[1:58:19] everyone that heareth these sayings of
[1:58:21] mine and doeth them not shall be likened
[1:58:24] unto a foolish man which build his house
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; upon the sand. And the rain descended,
[1:58:32] the floods came. Same situation, same
[1:58:34] conditions. So the believer and the
[1:58:36] unbeliever. Are you with me? Amen.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; The believer and the unbeliever, the
[1:58:40] young man, the young woman, and the
[1:58:42] believing and the unbelieving, the
[1:58:44] families, believing and unbelieving.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; They are they're subjected to the same
[1:58:51] storms, the same things. There's
[1:58:54] sickness here, there's sickness there,
[1:58:56] there's financial matters here, fin
[1:58:58] relationships here, relationships there.
[1:59:01] This is the only answer that I have in
[1:59:06] this world. And it and the key is the
[1:59:10] key is do it.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Just do it and it will work. Listen to
[1:59:16] that inner witness and do it and it will
[1:59:20] work.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close just with testimony.
[1:59:24] I've been I've spoken some personal
[1:59:26] things, but I I had a I had a buddy and
[1:59:30] I mean we were more than buddies. We
[1:59:32] stayed together.
[1:59:34] He stayed in my room.
[1:59:37] I lived out at his mom and dad's place
[1:59:39] every weekend out on the farm and he was
[1:59:43] just about one year younger than me and
[1:59:45] we were as close. We were so close. I've
[1:59:48] maybe told you about by the younger ones
[1:59:50] wouldn't have heard. And he was built he
[1:59:52] was built like a o ax.
[1:59:55] He was so strong at 15. You know what a
[1:59:58] railroad tie is that's under the
[2:00:00] railway. At 15 years old, he was
[2:00:02] carrying the green ties from the mill to
[2:00:06] stack them. That was his work all day.
[2:00:09] At 15 years old, I mean, he was strong.
[2:00:13] But he he he didn't hardly speak. He was
[2:00:15] real real quiet.
[2:00:18] So he'd say to me, "Treat me like
[2:00:20] Aaron." But he wasn't Moses.
[2:00:24] But he'd say, "You know, you do the
[2:00:26] talking. I'll hit him.
[2:00:31] which we I never never got into that,
[2:00:33] but that's the kind of person he was.
[2:00:35] You do the talking and I'll hit them.
[2:00:38] God help anybody he hit.
[2:00:43] They wouldn't see stars. They would see
[2:00:44] planets.
[2:00:48] But we were in a meeting. We were both
[2:00:49] we're both kind of half, you know,
[2:00:51] backsliden and, you know, just being
[2:00:53] silly and not doing anything bad, but we
[2:00:56] just weren't living for God the way we
[2:00:58] should. and playing around in the world
[2:01:00] and nothing bad just you know being two
[2:01:04] young guys
[2:01:06] and we we knew the way I knew the way
[2:01:08] his mom and dad were Christians and mine
[2:01:10] also but I wasn't my parents I was
[2:01:13] already working
[2:01:15] we had a service I'll never forget it
[2:01:19] and I was I was just sick I just sick of
[2:01:22] you know if you're a Christian listen to
[2:01:24] me young people there's nobody as
[2:01:27] miserable As a miserable young person
[2:01:30] who knows the way and isn't living it,
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; you're just miserable. You can never fit
[2:01:36] in the world.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil ever tell you or
[2:01:39] tempt you that you can fit in the world.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; You'll never fit in the world.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; You'll be utterly miserable.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; And I was miserable. And he was too. And
[2:01:52] this night there was a service. I don't
[2:01:54] know who spoke. I don't know. But I was
[2:01:56] under such conviction and we both just
[2:01:58] came down to the front and and
[2:02:01] surrendered our lives.
[2:02:04] The very next week he went to a dance.
[2:02:09] The next Saturday night he went to a
[2:02:11] dance
[2:02:12] and I was so smitten. I thought,
[2:02:16] you know, we both we both started out
[2:02:19] together. We both went to the altar
[2:02:20] together and and and as far as I was
[2:02:24] concerned, it was over.
[2:02:26] I just gave my life to God right then
[2:02:28] and there and that was it.
[2:02:31] And he went to a dance and it wasn't
[2:02:33] long. Now watch the process.
[2:02:37] Wasn't long and had a girlfriend
[2:02:40] and wasn't long and he had a baby
[2:02:44] and then
[2:02:46] maybe got married to her. I don't know
[2:02:48] what happened.
[2:02:50] And then he had to work. He was doing
[2:02:52] work and he was out of the city and they
[2:02:54] had another baby
[2:02:56] and he said, "That baby isn't mine. I'm
[2:02:59] not the father of that baby." That was a
[2:03:01] position he took and I will not support
[2:03:04] that baby. And trouble trouble came. He
[2:03:08] just had more trouble. In the meantime,
[2:03:11] I'm just our two pathways just went
[2:03:13] straight like this.
[2:03:17] I had the same battles. I had the same
[2:03:19] bills to pay, same everything, same
[2:03:21] work. Had to work every day, slug it
[2:03:23] out, have good days, bad days, all the
[2:03:25] rest of it. But my heart just bled for
[2:03:28] him.
[2:03:30] And
[2:03:32] his father was an elder in my church.
[2:03:34] And he was like a to me, he was like a
[2:03:39] before we even came to the message, I
[2:03:41] looked on him as as a spiritual father.
[2:03:43] He was just a wonderful man. and he
[2:03:45] taught me how to hunt and he was just a
[2:03:48] man of the wilderness. He was a
[2:03:50] wonderful man. You'll meet him,
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; brother Guy Haney. You'll meet him.
[2:03:57] And we'd walk through the woods and and
[2:03:59] and he wasn't interested in hunting and
[2:04:01] I really wasn't. I wanted to always talk
[2:04:02] to him about we'd talk about the
[2:04:05] rapture. We'd talk about the we talk
[2:04:07] about what God is doing. And and God
[2:04:09] used him, you know, in and he'd say,
[2:04:12] "Well, you have a certain desire for
[2:04:14] God." And I would say, "That's right,
[2:04:15] Brother Haney." Well, you know, God is
[2:04:18] God has got his hand on you. And he
[2:04:20] encouraged me along. And I saw a man of
[2:04:23] such faith. I was working with him one
[2:04:26] day and he was driving a nail, had his
[2:04:28] hand on the corner of a board and missed
[2:04:32] his nail and hit his thumb and split his
[2:04:34] thumb right open. And oh, and he just he
[2:04:39] took his handkerchief out and wrapped it
[2:04:41] around it. said, "Lord Jesus, you know,
[2:04:45] just heal this." Took his handkerchief
[2:04:48] off and his thumb was healed. And we're
[2:04:50] both standing on a scaffold. And I I
[2:04:53] can't hardly believe it. He just carried
[2:04:55] on working like nothing happened. And I
[2:04:57] I had such an mad admiration for him,
[2:05:00] such respect. And this was his son.
[2:05:04] called a son up in in court and
[2:05:07] sentenced him to six months in jail for
[2:05:10] not supporting this child, which he was
[2:05:12] sure was not his.
[2:05:15] And he had to go to jail for 6 months.
[2:05:18] Brother Haney, this dear brother, in the
[2:05:21] winter time, he dug graves.
[2:05:24] He dug graves for a living and had to
[2:05:27] burn tires. Are you listening?
[2:05:30] had to burn tires so he could make the
[2:05:33] ground soft and dig this grave.
[2:05:37] And he said to me, he said, you know,
[2:05:41] he said, this judge sent my son to jail.
[2:05:45] He said, and I I knelt down. I prayed,
[2:05:49] if his decision was right,
[2:05:52] you let it stand.
[2:05:55] If it's not right, remove him from his
[2:05:58] place. In two weeks, this man dug his
[2:06:02] grave and buried that judge.
[2:06:07] That kind of contact with God, I admired
[2:06:11] it immensely.
[2:06:12] But even the son that he prayed for,
[2:06:15] that son just went the way of the world.
[2:06:17] And one day at 35 years old, healthy as
[2:06:22] a ox, he came home.
[2:06:26] his wife who he was with then was
[2:06:28] another woman
[2:06:30] and he said just have a I'll just have a
[2:06:32] sandwich or something. Had a little bite
[2:06:34] to eat. Said I think I'll just lay down
[2:06:36] on the sofa. He laid down on the sofa
[2:06:37] and his heart stopped and he was gone.
[2:06:43] And they did an autopsy
[2:06:46] and told his brother who's a very dear
[2:06:48] friend of mine who was actually a deacon
[2:06:50] in our church. They said, "What
[2:06:53] happened? what was the cause of death?
[2:06:56] And the doctors just said his heart just
[2:06:59] stopped. We don't know why. Totally
[2:07:02] healthy man. His heart stopped.
[2:07:06] And I have
[2:07:08] I've have that and that's my experience.
[2:07:12] He was my buddy. He was as probably
[2:07:15] close to me as anybody.
[2:07:20] But when as close as we were, when that
[2:07:23] next week came and I had prayed and he
[2:07:26] had prayed, but when the next week came
[2:07:28] and he said, "I went to a dance." That
[2:07:31] is when that little witness inside.
[2:07:35] We're on two different roads.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; As close as you are, you got friends, I
[2:07:40] got friends. You got associates, I got
[2:07:42] associates. But when they go one
[2:07:45] direction, you have to choose another
[2:07:47] direction.
[2:07:49] Watch me young fellas.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; I'm talking right to you. You got to
[2:07:54] make a decision.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; You got to apply your life in another
[2:07:58] direction.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; And it'll work.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; And if you don't listen to that witness,
[2:08:07] it won't work.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; I felt so much to speak to this
[2:08:12] congregation this morning on applying
[2:08:14] the word. And I won't read the quote.
[2:08:17] Brother Brown says, "You've heard
[2:08:18] enough." You know how much we've heard?
[2:08:19] We've heard just tons of messages.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; We've heard all kinds of it. And now I
[2:08:26] say to you in the name of our Lord Jesus
[2:08:28] Christ.
[2:08:30] Just do it.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Just be the wise man.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; And you fellas, you'll never regret it.
[2:08:36] Young ladies, you'll never regret it.
[2:08:38] Say, "I stood for this word."
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; Regardless of what anybody
[2:08:44] and I tell you, I took I took it. I took
[2:08:48] such a serious place with the word. And
[2:08:50] I began I I entered into a love
[2:08:52] relationship. I love the word. Oh, I
[2:08:54] just love the scripture. I love the
[2:08:56] Bible. That's why it touched me. Brother
[2:08:58] Danny, we said, "You got a Bible." And
[2:09:00] you just started to love God more. I
[2:09:03] just loved it. I didn't know anything
[2:09:05] about a prophet. Didn't know anything
[2:09:06] about Malachi 4, but I just love the
[2:09:08] word. Just open the word up to me. Open
[2:09:10] it up to me.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; My father,
[2:09:17] was a godly man
[2:09:20] and we were apart most of our life
[2:09:25] after my mother's passing
[2:09:28] and only once
[2:09:31] did he give me a scripture that I
[2:09:34] remember
[2:09:35] and I leave it with you
[2:09:38] and you young people you can write it
[2:09:40] down
[2:09:43] and if you have a Bible that I signed
[2:09:45] this is the scripture that will under
[2:09:47] it.
[2:09:50] Just listen to the words first.
[2:09:55] He that hath my commandments
[2:09:58] and keepeth them,
[2:10:04] he it is that loveth me.
[2:10:07] And he that loveth me shall be loved of
[2:10:09] my father
[2:10:11] and I will love him
[2:10:14] and will manifest myself to him.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; I was a teen brother James when that
[2:10:25] my dad and it it like branded my heart.
[2:10:31] Little did I know that years later,
[2:10:33] years later,
[2:10:35] then I I didn't know I was living in the
[2:10:37] very age that he was revealing himself.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; And I read the scripture and read the
[2:10:42] scripture and held it in my heart. He
[2:10:44] that hath my commandments and keepeth
[2:10:47] them, we do them.
[2:10:50] He it is that loveth me, and he that
[2:10:52] loveth me shall be loved of my father,
[2:10:55] and I will love him. Oh, I thought
[2:10:58] that's so wonderful. I will love him and
[2:11:02] will manifest myself to him.
[2:11:06] Will you just bow your head with me?
[2:11:11] And I want to invite you.
[2:11:16] You may feel something very deep just
[2:11:18] now. Feel and sense the Holy Spirit
[2:11:21] speaking.
[2:11:25] You may want to just lift your hand.
[2:11:28] lift your heart,
[2:11:31] Lord Jesus. I want this kind of
[2:11:32] relationship.
[2:11:35] I want to be loved of you.
[2:11:38] I want to be one that doesn't only hear
[2:11:40] you. Oh God, oh God, grant me grace to
[2:11:43] do what I need to do. Maybe there's some
[2:11:46] of you here that know,
[2:11:48] you ought to say something. Perhaps
[2:11:51] there's something you need to go to
[2:11:53] someone and make it right. Or you need
[2:11:56] to take a stand. You need to be very
[2:11:58] clear with your decision.
[2:12:01] Don't leave it, young man, young woman.
[2:12:04] Don't leave it, my brother, my sister.
[2:12:06] Don't leave it. Do what we need to do.
[2:12:10] And God will bless you for it. God will
[2:12:13] bless your home. Bless your family.
[2:12:16] We'll bless your witness. We'll bless
[2:12:18] your testimony. Father, in the name of
[2:12:22] Jesus Christ, take I pray this group of
[2:12:25] people in the atmosphere that we are in
[2:12:28] and we want to say only you, Lord. Only
[2:12:31] you. You're the only fountain that we
[2:12:34] can run to. You are the bleeding word.
[2:12:37] You are the one, Lord Jesus, for us to
[2:12:40] for us to be here in this sanctuary
[2:12:42] today. and those that are streaming and
[2:12:45] for us to try to comprehend and take
[2:12:47] into our into our mind, Lord, it just
[2:12:50] almost we're incapable of doing so, but
[2:12:53] we're attempting to try to understand,
[2:12:57] Lord, your grace, the depth of your
[2:12:59] grace, that you would send such a word
[2:13:02] as we have, such a message as we have,
[2:13:04] and to realize that mankind hasn't had
[2:13:07] this all through the centuries, all
[2:13:09] through the generations. And here we
[2:13:11] are. Oh, such a privileged and honored
[2:13:14] people. Lord, work deep. Speak deep. I
[2:13:19] pray, oh God, that lives will be
[2:13:22] transformed,
[2:13:24] changed,
[2:13:26] changed. Oh God, word of God ever true,
[2:13:31] changing me, changing you. May we Lord
[2:13:35] uh come under the uh under the impact of
[2:13:39] the Holy Spirit at this time, at this
[2:13:43] moment, Jesus, as you're drawing near, I
[2:13:47] pray you'll touch our lives, Lord. Touch
[2:13:49] my brothers and sisters, their homes.
[2:13:52] And in this time, Lord, that it's not an
[2:13:54] easy day. It's not an easy age we live
[2:13:57] in. It's difficult. I pray that you will
[2:14:01] be very, very near. I'm asking Lord, you
[2:14:03] be very near. These people are so
[2:14:06] precious to me, to you. And I ask for
[2:14:11] all believers, oh God, that are that you
[2:14:15] have called your children, wherever they
[2:14:18] are, wherever they're fellowshipping
[2:14:20] today. Lord, not only those that are
[2:14:23] streaming, but those that are
[2:14:24] fellowshipping elsewhere. I pray, oh
[2:14:27] God, that your Holy Spirit will move
[2:14:30] near to them and bring a people to
[2:14:33] yourself that will do your word. Not
[2:14:36] just hear it, but do your word, oh God.
[2:14:39] Those that are seeking you, those that
[2:14:40] love this message, those that love your
[2:14:43] messenger, oh God. Father, you will look
[2:14:46] kindly upon them. And I pray that you
[2:14:48] will do your your supernatural work in
[2:14:52] all of our lives in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:14:56] I ask it and thank you for it. And if
[2:14:59] there's someone here, Lord, whose soul
[2:15:01] is still away from you.
[2:15:05] They do not have the assurance of
[2:15:07] salvation.
[2:15:09] They do not know that they have eternal
[2:15:11] life.
[2:15:13] If they're one that you have called, oh
[2:15:14] God, maybe this be the moment that they
[2:15:17] will receive you, Lord Jesus Christ, as
[2:15:20] their substitute, as their sacrifice,
[2:15:23] and they will discover their names are
[2:15:25] on the lamb's book of life. We pray,
[2:15:28] Father, you'll grant this.
[2:15:31] Do so, Lord Jesus.
[2:15:34] Work amongst us, oh God. I pray. Will
[2:15:37] you pray with me, saints? Each one of
[2:15:39] you, we pray that his will now will be
[2:15:42] done at the closing of this service.
[2:15:46] Pass me not, oh gentle savior, brother
[2:15:49] Ryan, please.
[2:15:51] [Music]
[2:15:53] Pass
[2:15:55] me not. Oh gentle
[2:16:00] say,
[2:16:03] I know, Lord, it's true. I know it's
[2:16:05] true. you.
[2:16:08] Oh yeah.
[2:16:12] All right.
[2:16:17] And while
[2:16:20] [Music]
[2:16:21] others
[2:16:23] thy
[2:16:30] do
[2:16:33] not pass
[2:16:36] me by.
[2:16:41] Oh,
[2:16:42] save
[2:16:52] [Music]
[2:16:56] my
[2:17:00] cry.
[2:17:03] [Music]
[2:17:06] And while
[2:17:09] on others,
[2:17:11] thou art called.
[2:17:17] Oh, do
[2:17:20] not pass.
[2:17:25] Let's all stand together, shall we?
[2:17:28] Oh,
[2:17:35] Savior.
[2:17:41] Hear my humble
[2:17:47] cry.
[2:17:52] and while
[2:17:55] on others
[2:17:57] thou are called.
[2:17:59] [Music]
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; Oh Savior, do you
[2:18:06] not pass
[2:18:08] me?
[2:18:11] [Music]
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be dismissing the service
[2:18:15] soon, but I don't want to dismiss it.
[2:18:16] Well, I know in my heart
[2:18:22] that God is speaking to individuals
[2:18:25] [Music]
[2:18:29] and some perhaps
[2:18:32] I don't know every heart, but some that
[2:18:35] just have not been able to surrender.
[2:18:38] You've not surrendered. I think of
[2:18:40] brother Tim Dodd's words. Don't miss it.
[2:18:45] Don't miss your opportunity. once again
[2:18:48] in this service has taken a strange
[2:18:50] direction for me, one that I did not
[2:18:53] expect and God is doing it for a
[2:18:56] specific purpose. And if you're here and
[2:19:00] you need prayer,
[2:19:02] I'll be so happy if I'll tell you what.
[2:19:06] Do it whatever it takes. Do it whatever
[2:19:09] it takes. I pulled out of my seat. I
[2:19:12] came down to the front. Not because
[2:19:14] there's anything more holy and sacred
[2:19:16] down here. I wanted to do it. I wanted
[2:19:19] the people to know. I wanted the devil
[2:19:22] to know. I was leaving the ways of sin.
[2:19:26] I was surrendering my life to the Lord
[2:19:29] Jesus Christ. And I was making a
[2:19:31] conscious decision. I was wouldn't allow
[2:19:34] anything. If my friend came, if he
[2:19:37] didn't come, I was going. I heard the
[2:19:40] master call and I was going and I if
[2:19:44] you're here and you're in that state, uh
[2:19:47] some of you on my heart, I have specific
[2:19:49] ones on my heart and I'm speaking to
[2:19:52] you. I'm I'm drawing all the forces of
[2:19:56] heaven sending the angels of God. Send
[2:19:59] them, Lord, the Holy Spirit. And cause
[2:20:02] them to be persuaded, not almost, but
[2:20:05] fully persuaded.
[2:20:07] This is my hour. This is my moment. This
[2:20:09] is my time. Grant it, Father, in the
[2:20:13] name of Jesus. Lord, whoever you're
[2:20:16] striving with, may they surrender to you
[2:20:18] at this moment.
[2:20:22] Oh save
[2:20:25] your
[2:20:34] hear
[2:20:37] my humble
[2:20:40] cry
[2:20:45] and quiet
[2:20:49] one
[2:20:49] [Music]
[2:20:51] You are calling
[2:20:54] but you're speaking to others. Lord, oh
[2:20:57] my Jesus, you do
[2:21:00] not pass
[2:21:02] me by.
[2:21:05] [Music]
[2:21:15] Only you, Lord. Only you.
[2:21:21] Holy
[2:21:25] Lord.
[2:21:26] [Music]
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; You're the same God.
[2:21:36] You speak, Father.
[2:21:39] Speak and bless him, I pray.
[2:21:42] Lord, do it.
[2:21:46] Oh my father. You're my father.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; You're the master.
[2:21:53] [Music]
[2:21:56] I
[2:22:02] only
[2:22:06] [Music]
