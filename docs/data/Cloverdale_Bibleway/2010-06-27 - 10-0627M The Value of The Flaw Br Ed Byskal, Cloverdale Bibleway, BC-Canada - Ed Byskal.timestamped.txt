[15:40] &gt;&gt; Blessed be your name. Hallelujah.
[15:43] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; We want to go to prayer at this time and
[15:48] ask our brother Tom if you would just
[15:49] come and open the service in a word of
[15:51] prayer. We don't have any written
[15:53] requests. We know there's many needs
[15:55] amongst the people and many times I keep
[15:58] the prayer requests from previous
[15:59] services just to bring to my mind
[16:02] different requests and want to continue
[16:05] to remember our brother Shawn Martin who
[16:06] lost his wife a few weeks back with four
[16:09] children. The youngest one who's only a
[16:10] few months old. I want to just continue
[16:12] to pray that the Lord would be his
[16:14] portion and be his his comfort, his
[16:16] encouragement, his strength during this
[16:18] time and continue to remember the body.
[16:20] Amen. Brother Tom, if you would just
[16:21] come and take these knees before the
[16:24] Lord.
[16:26] Let's pray.
[16:31] Hallelujah.
[16:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; We do bless your name, Lord. We bless
[16:42] that holy name, that worthy name, that
[16:46] name that is above all names. We worship
[16:49] you. The living God, the lovely Lord
[16:51] Jesus Christ. Lord, would you be pleased
[16:54] with our worship this morning. The
[16:56] saints have gathered. The presence of
[16:58] God is here. We believe angels are here.
[17:01] We believe the glory of God is here. So
[17:04] with uplifted hearts and uplifted voices
[17:07] and our hands lifted up, we want to
[17:10] worship you, the true and living God.
[17:12] this great unveiling of God, this mighty
[17:14] God that has been unveiled before us in
[17:17] this hour, Lord, for a mighty message
[17:19] that has come that if people realize and
[17:23] know who they are, what an hour, what a
[17:26] day.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; And we lift up that word that has done
[17:30] such mighty works within our lives. And
[17:33] so Lord, any need, any any hurting, any
[17:36] pain, any soul that needs a deliverance,
[17:39] any bone that is needed, Lord, we
[17:42] believe the presence of God is here. And
[17:44] so we ask you, Lord, that you will take
[17:47] every burden for you are the great
[17:49] burden bearer. That you would pack that
[17:52] burden this morning if we cast them at
[17:54] your feet. You say, Lord, would you deal
[17:57] with them? Would you help them that need
[18:00] help? Lord, we're not helpless. We're
[18:02] not hopeless because we believe in a God
[18:04] that is real and alive.
[18:07] [Music]
[18:08] Lord, we sense your nearness. We just
[18:10] want more of you. So, as the pastor will
[18:13] come, would you anoint the man of God?
[18:16] Lord, may you move the man aside and let
[18:19] the Holy Ghost minister to our soul and
[18:23] may our hearts be open to you that you
[18:25] may take the pen of your word, scribe
[18:28] that love letter again deep within our
[18:31] hearts, Lord. Minister to the needy,
[18:35] meet those that have a need this
[18:36] morning. And father, I know that as we
[18:40] leave the house of God, there will be
[18:42] praise on our lips, thanksgiving in our
[18:44] hearts to know that you're a real and
[18:47] living God that can be touched by the
[18:51] feeling of our infirmity.
[18:55] So, great high priest, would you
[18:56] minister in a great way this morning?
[18:59] And may father from every song that be
[19:02] sung Lord may you be glorified be
[19:06] glorified in our lives. We pray in Jesus
[19:10] precious name. Amen.
[19:14] Amen. God bless you all. You may have
[19:16] your seats.
[19:19] just have one announcement to make and
[19:22] and that will be a change of the
[19:25] schedule for the summer time over
[19:28] starting next week July 4th weekend.
[19:30] We'll be going to a one service on
[19:33] Sunday and um already we have four or
[19:36] five families that have
[19:39] left us. They're on holiday somewhere.
[19:42] So, I'm sure there'll be others and
[19:43] families leaving and departing, but that
[19:46] won't hinder the length of the service.
[19:50] Amen.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; You know, one day we keep on saying,
[19:52] "Well, let's just carry on the morning
[19:54] to the evening." Well, maybe this
[19:56] summer's the summer.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; You keep pulling and God keep moving.
[20:00] That's all we want. The Holy Spirit to
[20:02] start moving in our lives. Not just
[20:04] having one service on Sunday. We're
[20:06] having a continual service on Sunday.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; So, we'll look at it that way. And we
[20:10] have our Wednesday night service, of
[20:12] course, and our Friday night prayer
[20:14] meetings that the saints are gathering.
[20:16] Brother Kyle gave me a wonderful report
[20:18] and I and I so love it when I get those
[20:20] little emails. The Friday night prayer
[20:23] meeting was such an unusual encounter
[20:26] with God. And that's what we're looking
[20:28] for, brother Roy. That's what we want.
[20:30] So, Friday night's prayer meeting's
[20:32] open. We'll just gather and worship God.
[20:35] So, God bless you. Starting um July 4th,
[20:39] and we'll make that announcement tonight
[20:40] for some saints that aren't here. And uh
[20:43] we'll just remind one another. God bless
[20:45] you.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Once again, we want to greet you
[20:52] all in the name of the Lord Jesus
[20:53] Christ. And those who are on the
[20:54] internet streaming with us, we just hope
[20:56] that you feel a part of the service this
[20:59] morning. Our brother Darren has an
[21:01] announcement for us regarding the school
[21:03] meeting we had a couple weeks ago.
[21:04] Brother Darren, if you would come and
[21:06] just give that for us real quickly. And
[21:07] just as he comes, an announcement
[21:10] uh also want to welcome a visitor, uh,
[21:12] Sister Mon from Belgium. Where is she?
[21:15] We could have her stand so we could
[21:16] welcome her. She's with us for a couple
[21:17] months. God bless you. Welcome. Thank
[21:19] you for welcome. Thank you.
[21:23] Also want to make an announcement that
[21:25] there will be a junior choir practice
[21:28] this afternoon at 3:00. And Lord
[21:29] willing, they'll be singing for us
[21:31] tonight. So, sorry it's such short
[21:33] notice, but being this is the last
[21:34] Sunday with two services, we'd like to
[21:36] have the junior choir sing for us once
[21:38] more. Amen. So, brother Darren, if you'd
[21:40] come, just give us the announcement.
[21:46] Good morning. Uh we just want to give an
[21:48] update on the uh school building
[21:50] project. About two weeks ago, we met in
[21:53] the fellowship hall just to discuss some
[21:55] of the finances of the church and uh but
[21:57] the main reason for the gathering was to
[22:00] discuss the pro the uh the status of the
[22:02] school project. um to make you aware of
[22:05] what's been going on, to make you aware
[22:07] of the finances that will be involved in
[22:09] in taking on such a project as that. And
[22:13] so once we had the presentation,
[22:16] we had asked everyone, you know, we want
[22:18] you to fill out a feedback form because
[22:21] we want to know whether or not you
[22:23] support this project because the one
[22:25] thing that we don't want to do is, you
[22:27] know, burden the congregation with with
[22:30] a a debt, a mortgage that the
[22:32] congregation was not willing uh to back
[22:35] up to support.
[22:37] And so we gathered all the feedback
[22:40] forms and I didn't go to bed till like
[22:42] 1:00 in the morning. So I'm going to
[22:44] count those and get all the information.
[22:47] And uh you know we were thinking in our
[22:49] minds, yeah, we think it's going to go
[22:51] ahead. You know, we think there's enough
[22:52] support for it. But the amazing thing
[22:55] was is that when we tallied up the
[22:57] results that we had 112 feedback forms
[23:00] from we asked the people who pay ties to
[23:02] the congregation here if you would just
[23:05] provide your feedback, you know, if you
[23:06] were in support of the school, how much
[23:09] money you were able to uh, you know, to
[23:11] contribute each month, how many hours a
[23:12] week you were able to contribute as a
[23:14] volunteer.
[23:16] And the results were were overwhelming
[23:19] in favor of the school. We had 112 forms
[23:22] handed in and 107 were in support. So
[23:26] that's 90 about 96% of the congregation
[23:28] that were in that meeting and there's
[23:30] about half we figure about half of the
[23:32] uh eligible um voters were there. Well,
[23:36] not the voters but people who could
[23:37] provide the feedback. So it was
[23:40] overwhelming
[23:41] um to say the least that that many
[23:43] people were in support of it. we thought
[23:44] were maybe 60 70% of the people, but it
[23:48] just showed how much the people are
[23:49] behind the project and we really
[23:50] appreciate that. So, uh we've been doing
[23:54] more work where the Kim Dingwall has
[23:55] been work continuing to work with the
[23:57] city. Lord willing, we'll have the
[23:58] building permit on Monday. That's
[24:00] tomorrow.
[24:02] Uh we'll begin to clear the land of the
[24:04] trees, the uh the school annex, and the
[24:08] the old playground equipment. And then,
[24:10] Lord willing, again in about 2 weeks,
[24:12] we're going to start digging the hole.
[24:14] So, we're excited that God is, you know,
[24:17] just continuing. We're just continuing
[24:18] to take steps of faith to see if, you
[24:21] know, the Lord's willing to have the
[24:22] school building go um to go ahead. And
[24:25] we're just excited that we're going to
[24:26] finally be able to offer all the way
[24:28] from kindergarten to grade 12 for our
[24:30] children here. And so, we'll have lots
[24:33] of capacity now, the full gymnasium, the
[24:36] classrooms, the different labs, library.
[24:38] And we just thank God. And we thank you
[24:40] all for your support and your
[24:41] generosity. going to say God bless you
[24:43] very much. Thank you.
[24:53] Praise the Lord.
[24:56] I went to a couple years at BCA way back
[24:59] in the day. 93 94. It was a long time
[25:03] ago, but it's come a long ways and I'm
[25:04] really impressed to see what the Lord
[25:07] has done and what he's done through the
[25:09] brothers and sisters here. So, God bless
[25:10] you and our teachers. We appreciate you
[25:11] very much. God bless you. Uh, brother
[25:13] Gerard from Switzerland is here with us.
[25:15] So, he's going to come and bless us with
[25:16] a song. Maybe as he comes, if we could
[25:17] just sing, "Can't you see why I'm
[25:18] happy?" accept of the word of the Lord.
[25:21] Amen.
[25:23] Oh, can't you see
[25:25] [Music]
[25:26] why
[25:28] I'm so happy?
[25:32] Oh, for I accepted
[25:35] the word
[25:37] of the Lord.
[25:39] [Music]
[25:41] Is the real
[25:44] word
[25:46] that was spoken
[25:50] by the prophet
[25:53] of Malachi
[25:57] once again.
[25:58] Oh, can't you see
[26:02] why
[26:04] I'm happy?
[26:07] Yes, I rejected
[26:11] the word
[26:13] of God.
[26:17] It's the reveal
[26:20] word
[26:22] that was spoken
[26:26] by the prophet.
[26:31] Lord, can't you see?
[26:34] Oh, can't you see?
[26:38] Why I'm so happy.
[26:43] Oh, for I accepted
[26:47] the word of the Lord.
[26:53] the red
[26:56] word
[26:58] that was spoken
[27:00] [Music]
[27:02] by the prophet
[27:04] [Music]
[27:07] Lord. One last time.
[27:10] Oh, can't you see
[27:14] why?
[27:15] [Music]
[27:19] Oh, for I've accepted
[27:22] the word
[27:25] of the Lord.
[27:28] [Music]
[27:29] The revealed
[27:32] word
[27:33] that was spoken
[27:38] by the prophet.
[27:40] [Music]
[27:45] God bless you.
[27:50] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[27:53] Greet you all in the name of the Lord
[27:54] Jesus. This is about brother Gerard.
[27:58] Somehow I got pulled into this. We had
[28:00] him over for evening meal last night and
[28:02] we were playing and singing together and
[28:05] so I'm going to sing one song with him
[28:07] and then he's on his own.
[28:12] He plays guitar, plays harmonic at the
[28:15] same time and we were really blessed
[28:16] with it last night and figured that it
[28:19] would be a blessing for you all. So
[28:23] sing with us. We'll sing ala just to get
[28:26] warmed up and
[28:28] worship the Lord together. Amen.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, we come to you
[28:35] in worship.
[28:38] No matter what the circumstance,
[28:45] no matter what the situation,
[28:50] [Music]
[28:53] we will lift up the holy
[28:57] hands
[28:59] [Music]
[29:00] and
[29:07] I want to worship you.
[29:17] [Applause]
[29:18] [Music]
[29:21] I long
[29:23] to worship you.
[29:28] Oh Lord, we come to you in worship.
[29:35] No matter what the circumstance,
[29:42] no matter what you say
[29:47] you wish, we will be a holy
[29:54] handy
[30:04] I long to worship you.
[30:10] [Music]
[30:11] And

[30:40] and
[30:42] [Applause]
[30:47] I long
[30:49] to worship
[30:51] him.
[32:08] But God bless you first and I would like
[32:11] to thank you brother Ed and sister Bruce
[32:14] Biscar for having invited us in Hokub
[32:19] and we have spent that night a week. We
[32:23] have been visiting others Christian
[32:24] families in the states and hover in
[32:27] Cloverdale. You have been blessed and we
[32:30] thank you for your your blessing and we
[32:35] thank you to invit us. It was so so
[32:38] great and uh I've been in Christian
[32:42] since long in this message since quite a
[32:46] few years and uh one day six years ago
[32:50] we just met brother uh
[32:53] head by emailing and he went to twice
[32:55] twice in in Switzerland. It was really a
[32:59] great blessing. So I think it has
[33:02] blessed open a door in Switzerland
[33:04] somewhere and uh you know what uh I feel
[33:10] a bit uh emotional. It's difficult to to
[33:13] explain but you understand that. And um
[33:16] I would like to say uh in my life my my
[33:19] dad did two things. He gave me a small
[33:23] one. He gave me an ammonica when I was 8
[33:26] years old and I plac in that till today.
[33:29] And uh he did another nice huge things.
[33:33] He gave me a book a booklet one day. I
[33:36] was 18 and uh he was just smoking
[33:40] cigarette and he went to a kiosk and the
[33:42] ladies gave him back with a cigarette a
[33:44] booklet and he gave it to me because uh
[33:47] we were Christian he knew that but he
[33:49] didn't like it so much and said it's for
[33:51] you read it and uh you know what it was
[33:55] it was the fourth seal of brother Balam
[33:58] booklet so it was wonderful and uh I I
[34:03] said in myself uh Well, the heaven is
[34:06] speaking to the earth in a truly way.
[34:09] And I was very affected in right and I
[34:12] knew it was true. It was truthful. It
[34:14] was really there and I don't know why
[34:17] but we had to to wait. Two years passed
[34:20] by and we have to wait until we get
[34:22] really in the message and it's a long
[34:25] way don't want to speak about but we are
[34:27] there today. We have we enjoy to stream
[34:30] six six years and uh we have been so
[34:33] blessed by all the ministry that Don
[34:36] does other than ahead of course and uh
[34:40] we like it so much it's a a great
[34:42] blessing in our heart and uh I will to
[34:45] try to to play something for you know
[34:49] it's quite something FL so many people
[34:52] so uh I need to be relaxed a little bit
[34:54] and I will try to get out of those uh
[34:57] those uh instrument something. I was 18
[35:00] when I I started the guitar a little
[35:04] before and uh I I received in my mind
[35:07] why don't you try to mix up those both
[35:10] instrument
[35:12] I was 18 and uh it it started very hard
[35:14] because you know you have to concentrate
[35:16] you have to maybe you play too much more
[35:18] guitar and less harmonica and the bows
[35:21] and it took time to settle the thing all
[35:23] together so I enjoy it I I hope it will
[35:27] go tonight and I hope I I count on the L
[35:31] the Lord help of the Lord to to give me
[35:33] the
[35:35] like it was yesterday night,
[35:37] &gt;&gt; last night.

[49:25] will be true to the children
[49:32] our father
[49:38] we will be true
[49:41] [Music]
[49:47] [Applause]
[49:56] This part of the congregation never
[49:57] ceases to amaze me.
[50:00] Uh just for some facts,
[50:04] these songs, I looked them up on uh one
[50:07] of these internet sites that do the
[50:09] history of songs. The first time that I
[50:12] am bound for the promised land showed up
[50:14] in a song book in the current version
[50:16] that the children sang it was in 1895.
[50:20] I'm a child of the king showed up in a
[50:21] song book in 1877.
[50:24] And Faith of Our Fathers first showed up
[50:26] in a song book in 1849.
[50:30] I am bound for the promised land was
[50:31] actually originally written in 1787.
[50:36] Well, so I've been asked, why do you
[50:38] pick songs from the Philadelphiaian
[50:40] church age? And um quite literally
[50:45] in the light of Hebrews 13:8, I'm going
[50:48] to read Deuteronomy 19:14.
[50:51] Thou shalt not remove thy neighbors
[50:53] landmark which they of old time have set
[50:57] in thine inheritance.
[51:00] Israel collectively inherited that land.
[51:03] And the landmarks that were set there
[51:05] were set there for a reason
[51:08] which thou shalt inherit in the land
[51:11] which the Lord thy God giveth thee to
[51:14] possess it. And in Psalms 127:3, "Lo,
[51:18] children are inherited of the Lord."
[51:21] &gt;&gt; These are our inheritance.
[51:24] Um, each age, you know, as they're
[51:26] presented in eternity,
[51:28] um, we in the late age, as in all the
[51:31] rest of them, uh, we've simply
[51:32] progressed from one stage to the next as
[51:35] God continues to unveil himself.
[51:38] There's all of that I said to just make
[51:40] this one particular point. There is not
[51:42] two gospels. There is only one gospel
[51:46] and the same gospel that will speak to
[51:49] and create create a a seed in the heart
[51:51] of a 40-year-old is the same gospel that
[51:53] does that in a four-year-old.
[51:56] So that is what the Sunday school and
[51:58] the teachers try to reinforce each week
[52:01] and that is what you as believers are
[52:04] teaching your children at home. Having
[52:06] said that, I have
[52:10] one small request. I do have a need next
[52:14] year for a teacher. Uh this teacher is
[52:17] for the four-year-olds. And um I'd like
[52:20] to admonish everyone to go back and
[52:22] listen to the church age, not the church
[52:25] age, the church order message that was
[52:27] preached in 56 or you can read it in
[52:28] your cood book if you want to. And um
[52:31] for all of you sisters that have your
[52:34] family is grown and gone, that's means
[52:37] dragging grandma out of retirement. Yes,
[52:38] I know all that kind of stuff. But
[52:40] that's the age level that brother
[52:42] Brandham pegged as the ideal teacher for
[52:45] this class. So if you can pray about it
[52:47] over the summer sometime after camp, uh
[52:49] you know, come to me and tell me what
[52:51] the Lord's told you, would you? Okay, we
[52:53] need a teacher next year. So anyway, for
[52:56] our uh our missionary offering uh this
[52:58] year, uh consulted with brother uh
[53:00] Dingwall and to see what Bible believers
[53:02] needed to have happen. And I'd like
[53:04] brother Andrew Gruner to come grab our
[53:07] box.
[53:09] Brother Biscll, if you could come on up
[53:11] here and uh Sister Gindo can bring the
[53:16] envelope.
[53:41] Missionary offering. Cloverdale Bible
[53:44] Way Sunday School. The Sunday school of
[53:47] Cloverdale Bible Way would like to
[53:48] present their 2010 missionary offering
[53:51] to Bible believers to be used toward the
[53:54] purchase of a hub print station for the
[53:56] believers in Indonesia.
[54:00] This year's missionary offering consists
[54:02] of $595
[54:05] $994.35
[54:08] Canadian and $114.52
[54:14] US for a total of $78.87.
[54:27] Thank you. I'm not going to lift that.
[54:32] I know about how heavy that is.
[54:35] Well, but it's all in pennies.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; It's close to pennies.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; I'll let you Richard and God bless you.
[54:45] God bless you. God bless you. Sunday
[54:47] school.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Wonderful to hear all the songs.
[54:52] Thank you so much.
[54:59] Brother Richard's done such a splendid
[55:01] job with the school for so many years,
[55:03] the Sunday school. We're so appreciate
[55:05] that.
[55:12] Do you want to lead us in a course while
[55:14] they go down? And and we're having a
[55:16] baby dedication.
[55:18] Brother Eugene and Sister Gina Ivaneno.
[55:24] S. Sing
[55:27] same chorus again.
[55:29] Jesus loves even me.
[55:32] Oh, I am so glad that Jesus loves me.
[55:38] Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Oh yes,
[55:43] I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus
[55:49] loves
[55:50] me.
[55:52] Oh, and I am so glad that Jesus loves
[55:57] me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me.
[56:04] I am so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus
[56:09] loves me.
[56:14] [Music]
[56:18] I trust the children will be able to
[56:19] find their seats. Uh,
[56:23] won't be long, brother
[56:25] Eugene, Sister Gina, when you be stand.
[56:37] We're just so happy.
[56:39] Uh, we we rejoice with you. Amen. That's
[56:43] that's how all these children got here.
[56:48] You're just joining the club.
[56:52] How's it feel to be mom and dad?
[56:57] &gt;&gt; She hasn't said she she hasn't said much
[56:59] yet.
[57:03] Brother Eugene and Sister Gina have
[57:05] called their little girl Lily
[57:08] Anna.
[57:10] And I actually had a a picture, but I
[57:13] won't take the time. I had a picture of
[57:15] the lily of the valley. And there were a
[57:17] number of varieties. And one time I I
[57:21] really did a a study on it. It's a
[57:23] beautiful flower
[57:25] and uh has representation of our Lord
[57:28] Jesus Christ. And I trust that this one,
[57:33] this lily in your home will blossom into
[57:38] the beauty
[57:40] as God gave a plant, but into the
[57:42] fragrance also of a Christian life.
[57:45] That's my desire and that's what we'll
[57:47] be praying for.
[57:49] and Anna, Grace and Favor. Uh those are
[57:54] two names which are certainly
[57:58] uh I trust will reflect her life.
[58:03] And while I thought of uh your child and
[58:07] the names and and how you're blessed now
[58:10] with this daughter,
[58:12] how you choose to bring up this child
[58:16] will have a great effect on her future.
[58:19] I've spoken to a lot of children over my
[58:22] life and uh even in much my senior years
[58:26] it's amazing how children will come and
[58:30] uh I I can speak to them and I find that
[58:33] there are traces of uh their childhood
[58:38] and very early childhood and they recall
[58:41] and remember things that mother did,
[58:44] father did and uh and it's amazing how
[58:47] it's had effect on them and it stays in
[58:50] their mind. Uh they'll remember the
[58:53] earliest times. They'll remember laying
[58:55] on the perhaps on the floor in a blanket
[58:57] in the in the church. And you just
[59:01] cannot determine when the Holy Spirit
[59:06] they begin to sense something before
[59:08] they can even speak it. And sometimes
[59:11] they can sing something before they
[59:13] actually learn to talk well. And it's
[59:17] surprising uh how children are affected
[59:20] by the atmosphere of the church and
[59:22] atmosphere of a home. Very very much
[59:25] affected by the atmosphere of home. And
[59:27] I believe that a child brought up in a
[59:29] godly atmosphere will have much less to
[59:33] overcome. Uh brother Brandham said this
[59:36] about his own life. He said, "I tell you
[59:37] parents," he's speaking to parents. So
[59:39] he speaks to everyone here but I'm
[59:41] directing this uh more specifically to
[59:44] brother Eugene and sister Gina so that
[59:47] you'll remember this occasion. He said,
[59:49] "I tell you parents, you put the right
[59:52] kind of home before your children.
[59:54] That's the thing to do because if I had
[59:57] had
[59:58] a Christian home, he said, I'd have been
[1:00:01] reared up in perhaps I would have been
[1:00:05] further along with our Lord Jesus
[1:00:07] tonight and may more people have been
[1:00:11] saved." But my people was not a
[1:00:14] religious family. I thought that's so
[1:00:16] incredible. And I thought about your
[1:00:19] family, brother Eugene, and your
[1:00:21] parents, which I believe are here. Uh,
[1:00:24] your siblings and sister Gina, your
[1:00:27] parents that are here and to know how
[1:00:29] they have held the faith and have
[1:00:32] believed and and what has taken place.
[1:00:35] You have such a wonderful opportunity
[1:00:39] to pass this off to Lily Anna and I pray
[1:00:44] that you will do that.
[1:00:46] The things that you know, the Bible
[1:00:48] says, the secret things belong unto the
[1:00:51] Lord our God. But those things which are
[1:00:54] revealed
[1:00:57] belong to us
[1:01:00] and to our children
[1:01:02] forever, that we may do all the words of
[1:01:06] the law. And in this case, that we may
[1:01:09] do all the words that God has revealed.
[1:01:11] The revealed things belong to us. And
[1:01:16] the revealed things belong to her, to
[1:01:19] Lily, Anna.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; And it will be your lives, your
[1:01:24] atmosphere, the home that's created and
[1:01:28] and how you relate to her and how you
[1:01:31] relate to one another. This will be
[1:01:33] passed on. The revealed things that you
[1:01:35] hear here in the house of God and that
[1:01:38] God speaks to you, they belong also to
[1:01:41] her.
[1:01:42] I'm going to dedicate Liliana
[1:01:45] to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:01:51] Thank you, Lord. Will bow with me.
[1:01:55] Father, we really cherish this moment.
[1:01:59] And I know that Brother Eugene and
[1:02:00] Sister Gina,
[1:02:02] uh, they have something in their heart
[1:02:04] that they're holding. They're they've
[1:02:06] looked forward to this time. You've
[1:02:09] given them this jewel, this child, this
[1:02:12] dear one. And I know that they will
[1:02:14] treasure her. They will raise her up to
[1:02:17] serve you. I pray, Father, that in uh
[1:02:20] one of the first names that she'll ever
[1:02:23] have recollection of will be the name of
[1:02:25] the Lord Jesus Christ. May they instruct
[1:02:28] her. May they tell her the Bible
[1:02:30] stories. May they encourage and faith in
[1:02:35] her heart, Lord. And I pray that she
[1:02:37] early in life will come to know you as
[1:02:41] her savior. That you'll protect her and
[1:02:44] put a wall of fire about her and keep
[1:02:46] her from every evil thing. I pray. And
[1:02:49] God, I ask you to give her good health.
[1:02:52] And I pray that she will be a happy
[1:02:54] child. I pray she'll be a healthy child.
[1:02:57] And Lord, as you have given her to
[1:02:58] brother Eugene and sister Gina, they now
[1:03:01] stand here as to witness that they are
[1:03:04] giving her back to you. I pray you'll
[1:03:06] watch over her, oh God, and may her life
[1:03:09] be a delight in your sight. I dedicate
[1:03:12] Liliana in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:15] Christ. Amen.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Jane.
[1:03:24] God bless you. Amen. God bless, sister
[1:03:27] Gina. Amen.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Well, should I preach? Amen.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Are we ready for the word?
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; You're a wonderful congregation,
[1:03:44] a wonderful
[1:03:48] young peoples. And I hope that you
[1:03:51] rejoice also with the announcement that
[1:03:53] the school is going ahead.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; And you know when the people take a step
[1:03:59] of faith, are you all here all
[1:04:00] listening?
[1:04:03] Brother Darren said two weeks.
[1:04:07] I believe it was
[1:04:10] the Lord that inspired brother brother
[1:04:12] Kim Dingwall who's done a lot of work on
[1:04:14] this project along with the trustees and
[1:04:16] everyone else been working probably a
[1:04:19] year and a half two years on it.
[1:04:22] And uh, Brother Kim Dingwal called the
[1:04:24] government of Canada, the federal
[1:04:26] government, and asked them about the tax
[1:04:29] because there's taxes on all the
[1:04:32] building materials and everything that
[1:04:35] goes into this building. It's a almost a
[1:04:37] 30,000 square foot building. We'll hold
[1:04:40] 225 students and it's a full facility.
[1:04:45] And we just felt that this was something
[1:04:48] that should be done. And the government
[1:04:51] said, "No, you'll pay tax. You have to
[1:04:53] pay tax on it. Uh the only way that you
[1:04:56] get out of taxes, the only way that you
[1:04:59] we wouldn't be taxed is if it were a
[1:05:03] certain type of a process of between the
[1:05:06] church and the school." And brother Kim
[1:05:09] was able to quickly respond, "Well,
[1:05:11] that's exactly the way it is. That's
[1:05:14] exactly the way we're set up." and he
[1:05:17] says, "Oh, well then uh you won't have
[1:05:20] to pay any tax and I'll open a file
[1:05:22] right now and I'll send you the forms.
[1:05:24] Just fill out the forms and you'll come
[1:05:27] and and soon as we get the forms, we'll
[1:05:29] just be it'll be a file here." And
[1:05:31] brother Kim just did a quick calculation
[1:05:34] and there uh $150,000
[1:05:38] was deducted off of our budget.
[1:05:49] So God bless you with that.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Is uh I wonder did brother Daniel
[1:05:55] Brother Daniel Kihangu is he here or
[1:05:59] he's was in Seattle. I know when they're
[1:06:01] having a meeting brother Caumbi is down
[1:06:03] there preaching. I didn't know if he
[1:06:05] came. Uh, brother Daniel and I have been
[1:06:09] emailing back and forth and uh, his his
[1:06:13] mother just passed away. We we mentioned
[1:06:15] it here in church and left. Uh,
[1:06:19] there's five children altogether.
[1:06:21] Brother Daniel is the eldest at 23 years
[1:06:24] old and the rest of the family is back
[1:06:27] in Kenshasa, Congo. Uh, there's another
[1:06:31] brother that's 22. There's twin sisters
[1:06:34] that are 21 and there's one sister of
[1:06:38] 18. And brother Daniel had just told me,
[1:06:41] he said, I don't know why, but he said
[1:06:43] the last time I was in Congo, his father
[1:06:47] had passed away. And now his uh his
[1:06:52] mother, but at that time his mother was
[1:06:54] living. They're very young to have
[1:06:56] passed away. And she uh brother Daniel
[1:07:01] said, "I don't know, but something came
[1:07:02] over me and I just I prayed that God
[1:07:05] would preserve her and at least until
[1:07:09] her his youngest sister
[1:07:12] of 18, she wasn't 18 at the time, but
[1:07:15] that that she would be through school
[1:07:18] and she was writing her last final exam
[1:07:21] when she passed away." And I think that
[1:07:24] was the grace of God. Uh
[1:07:28] so we want to not only pray but I think
[1:07:31] we'd like to do I'd like to do the these
[1:07:34] five young people now they uh we'll find
[1:07:38] out more. I'll find out more next week
[1:07:41] but I don't I don't think they have
[1:07:43] really anything to live on and uh uh I
[1:07:47] think it would it's only right that we
[1:07:50] would contribute and do something. Uh,
[1:07:53] brother Daniel probably wouldn't want me
[1:07:54] to save the say this, but he's just been
[1:07:57] scrimping and saving because he's also
[1:08:00] taking further education in Seattle. And
[1:08:03] uh, he had saved up $2,000
[1:08:06] for his education to pay for his further
[1:08:10] education. And all of that was needed
[1:08:13] for the expenses and for the family and
[1:08:16] and I think they haven't even covered
[1:08:18] hospital bills or whatever. And so if
[1:08:21] you would like to contribute, I won't
[1:08:23] take an offering this morning, but I'll
[1:08:25] let you know about it and we are going
[1:08:27] to take an offering uh maybe next Sunday
[1:08:31] or after I've had a chance to talk to
[1:08:33] him probably two weeks from now. Would
[1:08:35] that be all right with the congregation?
[1:08:38] Would you like to do something? I I God
[1:08:40] has always blessed this congregation and
[1:08:43] I think that when we encounter something
[1:08:46] like this, well, it it it's pleasing to
[1:08:48] God. uh these all now don't have fathers
[1:08:52] or mothers and that is quite a concern
[1:08:56] and and but God knows and he he has
[1:08:59] received both to himself. Would you
[1:09:02] stand with me?
[1:09:04] We'll not sing anymore so you'll be
[1:09:06] free.
[1:09:10] Before we read the scripture,
[1:09:13] uh, I want to read out of Isaiah 53,
[1:09:18] but I'd like to have you bow your head
[1:09:20] with me.
[1:09:23] Heavenly Father, I sense and feel such a
[1:09:26] strange and wonderful
[1:09:29] presence.
[1:09:31] It is your presence. You have moved
[1:09:34] close, Lord. You are moving within my
[1:09:38] heart and I know the hearts of the
[1:09:40] people. There's a a sacred there's a
[1:09:43] sacredness.
[1:09:45] There's a quietness. I believe you've
[1:09:48] been pleased with the worship. Oh God,
[1:09:50] as the people began to sing about their
[1:09:53] blessed assurance. And then as the
[1:09:56] children sang, oh God, songs of the
[1:10:01] saints of ages past, songs that are as
[1:10:04] as alive this morning as they were when
[1:10:08] they were first inspired by the Holy
[1:10:10] Ghost. I pray, Father, that you will
[1:10:12] bless the uh congregation that is here
[1:10:16] and those that may be streaming and that
[1:10:18] are streaming through wherever they are
[1:10:20] on this planet earth. I pray that the
[1:10:23] same spirit will penetrate the homes and
[1:10:27] the hearts and the rooms, oh God,
[1:10:29] wherever it might be taking place. I
[1:10:32] pray that the same blessing of God will
[1:10:35] come upon them. Fill, I pray, Lord,
[1:10:38] everyone, every vessel, fill us to
[1:10:41] overflowing. May your word become so
[1:10:44] quickened. May things be spoken today
[1:10:47] that will never be forgotten. I pray
[1:10:50] that you'll brand our hearts, brand our
[1:10:53] minds, Lord, and prepare us even for
[1:10:55] this service this evening as our brother
[1:10:57] Tom will be ministering. I ask, oh God,
[1:11:00] you'll receive us as we present
[1:11:02] ourselves to you as living sacrifices in
[1:11:06] the name of our blessed beloved Lord
[1:11:08] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:13] If you'd open your Bibles,
[1:11:15] time has slipped away on us, but I I
[1:11:18] have a very unusual message on my heart,
[1:11:22] and I would like to have just as little
[1:11:24] movement as possible. And if you'd just
[1:11:27] give me your full and undivided
[1:11:28] attention
[1:11:31] in Isaiah 53, I'm going to read only
[1:11:33] five verses, starting with verse one.
[1:11:36] Who hath believed our report? And to
[1:11:38] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?
[1:11:42] For he shall go up before him as a
[1:11:44] tender plant, and as a root out of dry
[1:11:47] ground. He hath no form nor calmliness.
[1:11:52] And when we shall see him, there's no
[1:11:54] beauty that we should desire him. Isaiah
[1:11:57] the prophet is prophesying of our Lord
[1:11:59] Jesus Christ. Of course, he is despised
[1:12:03] and rejected of men, a man of sorrows,
[1:12:06] and acquainted with grief, and we hid as
[1:12:09] it were our faces from him. He was
[1:12:12] despised, and we esteemed him not.
[1:12:15] Surely he hath borne our griefs, and
[1:12:18] carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem
[1:12:21] him, stricken,
[1:12:23] uh, smitten of God, and afflicted.
[1:12:27] But he was wounded
[1:12:30] for our transgressions.
[1:12:32] He was bruised for our iniquities. And
[1:12:35] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:12:38] him. And with his stripes we are healed.
[1:12:42] God bless his word. as you have your
[1:12:44] saints.
[1:12:51] One of the most striking statements
[1:12:55] that I've pondered
[1:12:57] so much that brother Brandham has spoken
[1:13:01] uh when he preached the masterpiece
[1:13:03] message.
[1:13:05] He said concerning uh Michelangelo in
[1:13:09] his uh his statue or his uh work artwork
[1:13:14] of Moses
[1:13:17] and he said
[1:13:19] he struck it and he made a flaw on it.
[1:13:23] He said and it and it made a flaw on it.
[1:13:27] It put a flaw on the image.
[1:13:31] He said, "To me the flaw
[1:13:35] was what made it the masterpiece."
[1:13:40] That takes a great deal of thought.
[1:13:42] That's a very deep statement that the
[1:13:46] flaw made the masterpiece.
[1:13:49] I want to speak to you with God's help
[1:13:52] on the value of the flaw.
[1:14:01] A flaw is
[1:14:05] to do physical harm,
[1:14:08] to impair,
[1:14:11] to deface or defigure, disfigure,
[1:14:15] perhaps to blemish. That's a mar. But a
[1:14:18] flaw is a defect.
[1:14:22] It's a fault.
[1:14:24] It's an imperfection.
[1:14:27] It can be a physical disfigurement
[1:14:30] that prevents something from being
[1:14:32] totally perfect and distracts from its
[1:14:36] value. That's what we know as being a
[1:14:40] flaw or a mar. Something's marred.
[1:14:45] Michelangelo,
[1:14:47] he marred his
[1:14:49] uh his great statue which he had made.
[1:14:54] I was very moved as brother Ryan
[1:14:58] opened the service with uh blessed
[1:15:02] assurance because this is the first
[1:15:05] thing I was going to show you. I want to
[1:15:09] show you the author
[1:15:12] of uh
[1:15:14] that song.
[1:15:19] Would
[1:15:29] you give me the first one
[1:15:32] there? Could we dim the lights a wee bit
[1:15:35] also please?
[1:15:39] Uh
[1:15:43] the scripture was written, "And I will I
[1:15:46] will bring the blind by a way that they
[1:15:48] knew knew not. I will lead them in paths
[1:15:52] that they have not known. I will make
[1:15:55] darkness light before them, and crooked
[1:15:58] things straight. These things will I do
[1:16:01] unto them, and not forsake them."
[1:16:05] We have here a couple pictures of
[1:16:10] Fanny Crosby. Brother Brham referred to
[1:16:12] her many times.
[1:16:14] Born in 1820 and died in 1915
[1:16:20] about her blindness.
[1:16:22] She said
[1:16:25] it seemed intended.
[1:16:30] It seemed intended by the blessed
[1:16:32] providence of God that I should be blind
[1:16:35] all my life and I thank him for the the
[1:16:39] dispensation.
[1:16:41] If perfect earthly sight were offered me
[1:16:44] to tomorrow, I would not accept it. I
[1:16:49] might not have sung hymns to the praise
[1:16:51] of God if I had been distracted by the
[1:16:55] beautiful and interesting things about
[1:16:58] me.
[1:17:00] She was asked by uh and spoken to by a a
[1:17:04] minister
[1:17:06] and who said to her, "It's it's it's
[1:17:08] really sad that uh you haven't got your
[1:17:11] sight. Such a gifted and talented
[1:17:14] person. Perhaps you would have uh been
[1:17:18] been able to express so many other
[1:17:20] things." And she quickly responded that
[1:17:23] if I were offered sight right now, I
[1:17:26] would refuse it because she said,
[1:17:34] "The first thing
[1:17:36] I want to see is the face of my savior."
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; And she wrote the song, "I shall know
[1:17:43] him. I shall know him
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; by the prince of the nails in his hands.
[1:17:50] I can say that she certainly had a flaw
[1:17:55] in life,
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; but she used it for the glory of God.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; She didn't wallow in in it. She didn't
[1:18:02] wallow in the ground. She didn't allow
[1:18:04] her life to become a burden to others.
[1:18:08] She rather she gave glory to God and has
[1:18:12] blessed centuries of people.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:19] wrote over 8,000 songs.
[1:18:26] When Fanny died, her tombstone carried
[1:18:30] the words, "Aunt Fanny and
[1:18:37] blessed assurance,
[1:18:39] Jesus is mine."
[1:18:43] Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; I say that she
[1:18:52] indeed
[1:18:54] increased the value of the flaw.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; She could have just been blind, but she
[1:18:59] increased the value. She accepted it.
[1:19:02] She increased the value of it.
[1:19:06] And we may not have that kind of extreme
[1:19:12] uh example of a flaw in our lives, but
[1:19:16] I'm I want you to sit close and sit
[1:19:19] quiet. I'm going to come home to your
[1:19:21] address.
[1:19:23] And God has laid this. I have never
[1:19:25] spoken such a subject,
[1:19:28] but it is forever. Who whoever is here.
[1:19:31] And you may have thought you came as a
[1:19:33] visitor. This is for you.
[1:19:36] You say, "I come here all the time. I'm
[1:19:39] a member here." This is for you. You may
[1:19:41] be streaming and you say, "Uh, well, I'm
[1:19:44] I'm streaming and I always stream, but I
[1:19:46] want you to listen to this service
[1:19:49] differently." This is for you.
[1:19:53] I won't take the time to read the
[1:19:56] beautiful, beautiful poem that was read
[1:19:58] at her funeral, but it just started out
[1:20:01] by saying, "Away to the country of
[1:20:03] sunshine and song. Our song bird has
[1:20:07] taken her flight, and she who has sung
[1:20:11] in the darkest so long now sings in the
[1:20:15] beautiful light."
[1:20:18] Brother Brandham said about her, "The
[1:20:20] reason I respect blind Fanny Crosby, she
[1:20:24] never sold her gift out to the world.
[1:20:27] She kept it with God. My old blind Fanny
[1:20:31] Crosby had never seen in her life. But
[1:20:34] she screamed, "Pass me not, oh gentle
[1:20:36] Savior. Hear my humble cry
[1:20:41] while on others thou art calling. Do not
[1:20:45] pass me by.
[1:20:50] Moses had a flaw.
[1:20:54] The prophet said that all the prophets
[1:20:56] had flaws
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; and we all have flaws.
[1:21:07] He spoke about Abraham and Isaac and
[1:21:11] Jacob and Joseph.
[1:21:14] You can turn the lights back on now if
[1:21:16] you would please.
[1:21:18] Being the foundation corners of the
[1:21:21] great rock that the new masterpiece
[1:21:25] Jesus Christ would be built on.
[1:21:28] And he said Joseph's life was perfect.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; But he said he had a scratch.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; There was just a scratch.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; And the scratch was he said to his
[1:21:40] parents, his father rather, and his
[1:21:42] brothers, when you come, do not into
[1:21:45] Egypt, do not say that you're that
[1:21:48] you're shepherds
[1:21:50] because that's a uh that's looked down
[1:21:52] on. So say something that you're herders
[1:21:56] or that you're herdsmen or something,
[1:21:58] but you're not shepherds. But when they
[1:22:01] came and his father came and Pharaoh
[1:22:03] asked them, "What are you?" He said,
[1:22:06] "We're shepherds."
[1:22:08] He said, "That was a scratch even in
[1:22:11] Joseph's life."
[1:22:14] Uh, and you may sit in life, you may be
[1:22:17] sitting here today and saying,
[1:22:18] "Everything's going fine and
[1:22:20] everything's wonderful." and and young
[1:22:22] people whose lives are perhaps carefree.
[1:22:25] But let me just say this that you don't
[1:22:27] live very long before you feel a
[1:22:29] scratch.
[1:22:32] [Music]
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; And my message today really has and I
[1:22:37] feel a real urgency and I feel stirred
[1:22:41] a message thrusting through me that it's
[1:22:44] it's what you do with the flaw.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; What you do with it. And there are
[1:22:52] different ways that it comes. Sometimes
[1:22:56] it can be uh something direct that God
[1:22:59] actually does. For example, uh the the
[1:23:03] the this masterpiece message actually
[1:23:06] has its commencement with with Adam
[1:23:10] being in the image of God and God
[1:23:13] directly wounded him and took Eve from
[1:23:16] him and that was the mar in in in Adam.
[1:23:22] But it it had to have that in order to
[1:23:25] achieve a bride and a wife for him. And
[1:23:28] Christ was marred and at at Calvary that
[1:23:32] the bride of Jesus Christ would have a
[1:23:34] life.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; But Moses,
[1:23:40] he had a flaw. Sometimes it can be
[1:23:42] something not that God does directly,
[1:23:45] but something that God allows.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; He may allow it.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; A very very bad thing can happen. Very
[1:23:53] evil in your from your perspective can
[1:23:55] happen. But maybe but God often allows
[1:23:59] it to happen. And then we can ask why
[1:24:03] has God allowed this to happen? There is
[1:24:05] a positive spin to it.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; And if you're not careful, you'll take
[1:24:09] the negative side because Satan is
[1:24:12] inspiring the negative side and he wants
[1:24:15] you to think about the negative part of
[1:24:16] it. And the negative part of it can make
[1:24:19] a person embittered,
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; can make them angry,
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; can put a very negative twist in their
[1:24:27] life and and and wrench them out inside
[1:24:32] and they live a life far below where
[1:24:35] they should as a son and daughter of
[1:24:37] God. And then there's a third one and
[1:24:39] that is self-inflicted.
[1:24:42] We do things
[1:24:44] and we are so filled with regret and
[1:24:47] remorse and repentance and and on and
[1:24:50] on. Remember, you must deal with those
[1:24:53] things according to the scripture. If
[1:24:55] you do wrong, you repent. You you you
[1:24:58] you must deal with the flaw. You must
[1:25:01] deal with that self-inflicted wound so
[1:25:04] that God even can take it and and use
[1:25:07] you as a result of it. This is what I'm
[1:25:09] going to be speaking about. And I know
[1:25:12] we all have it.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I want you to I want
[1:25:16] you to take and absorb the service this
[1:25:18] morning and apply it into that area of
[1:25:22] your life. And if you can't apply it as
[1:25:24] of right now, probably next week or next
[1:25:27] month or who who knows when you will be
[1:25:29] able to apply it.
[1:25:32] The Bible says of Moses what God be to
[1:25:34] speak to him. And Moses said to the
[1:25:37] Lord, "My, oh my Lord,
[1:25:40] I am not eloquent,
[1:25:42] neither hereto for, not since thou hast
[1:25:46] spoken unto thy servant, but I am of
[1:25:49] slow speech." I want you to hear this.
[1:25:52] I'm going to dwell on that a moment. I'm
[1:25:54] of slow speech and of a slow tongue. And
[1:25:58] the Lord said, "Whoath made the mouth?
[1:26:01] Who's made the dumb or deaf or the
[1:26:03] seeing or the blind? Have not I the
[1:26:06] Lord?
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; And the slow, the word in the Hebrew is
[1:26:13] to be of heavy, to be weighty words, to
[1:26:16] be grievous words, difficult and
[1:26:20] burdensome, and even very oppressive. He
[1:26:24] wasn't eloquent. He didn't know how to
[1:26:26] say it. He just said it straight out and
[1:26:28] straightforward. and and perhaps his his
[1:26:31] language was burdensome and it came
[1:26:33] across oppressive. Do you know what some
[1:26:35] multitudes say concerning the prophet's
[1:26:38] message? It's so judgmental. It's so
[1:26:41] hard. He's always stripping us down.
[1:26:47] I'll give you two signs like Moses. But
[1:26:49] maybe he also that's why brother
[1:26:51] Brandham said, "I'm not educated. I
[1:26:54] can't preach like these men can preach.
[1:26:56] I I don't have the education." It was a
[1:26:59] burden to him.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; But it did not prevent him from saying,
[1:27:03] "Thus says the Lord.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; It did not prevent him from receiving
[1:27:10] and hearing the word of God for you, for
[1:27:13] this generation."
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; And he never rided himself of that flaw
[1:27:19] with his hints and his canes and all the
[1:27:21] all the grammar of the self. He still
[1:27:24] remembered a se still remained a seventh
[1:27:26] grade educated boy from Kentucky who
[1:27:30] didn't have any friends.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; He also carried
[1:27:36] all through his life because I was with
[1:27:38] him when he was 52 and 53.
[1:27:42] One day he just turned to me quickly
[1:27:44] because his daddy was an alcoholic.
[1:27:47] His daddy was a uh a bootleger
[1:27:52] and produced liquor.
[1:27:54] And brother Brandham was actually
[1:27:56] carrying the water from the for the
[1:27:59] still when the wind came into the trees
[1:28:02] and he heard the voice
[1:28:05] speaking to him. But he had that flaw
[1:28:08] all his life.
[1:28:10] And his parents were Catholics.
[1:28:13] And as I said to brother Eugene, sister
[1:28:15] Gina, he said, "I didn't have a
[1:28:18] religious home. Perhaps if I had, I'd
[1:28:20] been further down the road and more
[1:28:22] souls may have been saved."
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; He had a flaw
[1:28:30] and he carried it all his life. He said
[1:28:33] to me one day quickly, he said, "Brother
[1:28:36] Eddie,
[1:28:37] my daddy was a alcoholic,
[1:28:41] but he said, "If you ask me right now,"
[1:28:44] we were standing in a motel room. He
[1:28:46] said, ' If you asked me right now if
[1:28:49] there was gold bricks stacked from the
[1:28:52] floor to the ceiling of this room, he
[1:28:55] said, 'If you asked me what I would per
[1:28:57] sooner have that pile of gold bricks
[1:29:02] or five minutes with my daddy, he said,
[1:29:05] I'd take the five minutes with my daddy.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; So it was worth hundreds of millions of
[1:29:11] dollars for him
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; to be able to have five minutes with his
[1:29:15] daddy. Amen.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; I say that's a person that made the best
[1:29:19] of a flaw
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; and had his daddy die in his arms and
[1:29:24] was able to pray for him and pray with
[1:29:26] him and see his mother converted.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; He took the flaw of a Catholic family
[1:29:33] and turned the thing around.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Nothing is impossible with God.
[1:29:40] Amen.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; I thought of David. I just added this
[1:29:47] this morning.
[1:29:49] It was in my mind because I can see it
[1:29:50] all through the scripture, but I'm just
[1:29:52] wondering which one I should pick. And I
[1:29:55] thought of David
[1:29:57] and it's described in in Samuel
[1:30:02] and he wanted to build a house for the
[1:30:04] Lord and he wanted to do so many things
[1:30:07] and he had it in his heart
[1:30:12] and God sent Nathan and spoke to him.
[1:30:16] This is after he had taken Uriah taken
[1:30:19] Uriah's wife Ba Sheba.
[1:30:22] He said, "Wherefore hast thou despised
[1:30:25] the commandment of the Lord to do evil
[1:30:27] in his sight? Thou hast killed Uriah the
[1:30:31] Hitittite with the sword, and hast taken
[1:30:34] his wife to be thy wife, and has slain
[1:30:37] him with the sword of the children of
[1:30:39] Ammon. Now therefore, the sword shall
[1:30:43] never depart from thine house,
[1:30:48] because thou hast despised me, and hast
[1:30:51] taken the wife of Uriah the Hitittite to
[1:30:55] be thy wife. Thus saith the Lord,
[1:30:57] behold, I will raise up evil against
[1:31:00] thee out of thine own house, and I will
[1:31:02] take thy wives before thine eyes, and
[1:31:05] give them unto thy neighbor, and he
[1:31:07] shall lie with thy wives in the sight of
[1:31:10] this son. For thou ditch it secretly,
[1:31:13] but I will do this thing before all
[1:31:15] Israel and before the son."
[1:31:19] You might say, "This would be a hopeless
[1:31:22] situation. He took and had a man
[1:31:25] killed." so that he could have his wife
[1:31:27] and he needed to do so because she was
[1:31:30] already carrying David's child and God
[1:31:33] said he'll he'll die.
[1:31:36] You talk about a flaw.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; You talk about a a a mar in a person's
[1:31:43] life. But God never took away the fact
[1:31:46] that he would still be king.
[1:31:48] God never took away from him that his
[1:31:51] his praises and and and and God saw what
[1:31:55] he would do with the flaw.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; He accepted it.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; He accepted God's sentence and he said
[1:32:01] in the Psalms where he's worshiping,
[1:32:03] "Let my sentence come from your
[1:32:06] presence.
[1:32:09] Don't let it come from some man or a
[1:32:12] group of men, but let my sentence,
[1:32:15] whatever it is, let it come from your
[1:32:17] presence.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; And God so loved him
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; and he took his flaw and wrote some of
[1:32:24] the most glorious verses in the
[1:32:26] scripture and prophesied of Jesus Christ
[1:32:30] and reflected Jesus Christ in his life.
[1:32:32] And don't ask me how, where, or how this
[1:32:35] happens. And through that woman, Ba
[1:32:38] Sheeb becomes Solomon. God even allowed
[1:32:42] because God knew what he would do with
[1:32:44] that flaw. He accepted it. He didn't get
[1:32:47] bitter against God. He didn't question
[1:32:50] God. He received it.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; It's not whatever will be will be.
[1:32:58] No, it is taking it and and and putting
[1:33:01] it in a in a in a different uh you put
[1:33:05] it in a different environment and say I
[1:33:07] accept the sentence of God. I accept the
[1:33:10] word of God. I accept the forgiveness of
[1:33:12] God. I accept it and I will give my life
[1:33:15] as a sacrifice to God and let him do
[1:33:18] whatever he wishes with me.
[1:33:27] The tell the scripture tells us in in
[1:33:30] the book of Acts when the apostles were
[1:33:32] filled with the Holy Ghost and when they
[1:33:34] heard these things they were cut to the
[1:33:37] heart. I'm going to be going back and
[1:33:39] forth, but you'll follow the theme. They
[1:33:41] were cut to the heart and they nashed on
[1:33:44] him with their teeth. And that was after
[1:33:47] a a 30 secondond message that Peter gave
[1:33:51] also. When they heard when they heard
[1:33:54] that they were cut to the heart and took
[1:33:57] counsel to slay them. Peter had preached
[1:34:00] and I counted it. I read it myself like
[1:34:03] preaching. And it is no more, not even
[1:34:06] quite a 30 secondond sermon.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; And I thought I should read that sermon,
[1:34:12] but I won't even take the 30 seconds.
[1:34:14] But you know who was sitting there was
[1:34:17] Galio.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; The the instructor and teacher of
[1:34:20] Apostle Paul was sitting listening to
[1:34:23] this 30 secondond message. And when they
[1:34:26] said let's slay these people, Gale stood
[1:34:29] up after hearing a 30-second message and
[1:34:32] he said, "Let it let us not do this kind
[1:34:34] of thing. We can't fight God." And he
[1:34:37] turned and his his speaking convinced
[1:34:40] the people to turn away from killing
[1:34:42] these men.
[1:34:44] But why did they arise with such a an
[1:34:47] anger? Why did they have to spill out so
[1:34:49] much evil upon them? Because they were
[1:34:51] cut to the heart.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; It was the truth that cut them to the
[1:34:56] heart. These were like the words of
[1:34:58] Moses coming heavy and grievous and
[1:35:01] oppressive.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; We don't want to hear these things. We
[1:35:05] don't want to hear we can't cut our
[1:35:07] hair. We don't want to hear how we ought
[1:35:09] to dress. We don't want to hear how we
[1:35:12] should live and what we should see in
[1:35:14] our homes and the kind of material. We
[1:35:16] don't want to hear that. This is too
[1:35:17] oppressive. It's thus sayith the word.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; And we receive those heavy grievous
[1:35:26] words and say this is God speaking. I
[1:35:29] need this and I will benefit as I I
[1:35:32] receive it. Amen.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; It was a burden to the apostles to have
[1:35:40] to speak that way.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had to say, "I don't I
[1:35:45] don't hate the sisters.
[1:35:50] We love them. I'm trying to help them,
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; but it was a burden in his life."
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; And he was identified as a woman hater.
[1:36:02] He was identified as being all kinds of
[1:36:04] things and the message is still
[1:36:07] identified that way
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; and you can accept that rather than
[1:36:16] trying to smooth it out.
[1:36:22] Apostle Paul's great teacher, he was
[1:36:24] affected by that 32nd sermon and talked
[1:36:29] those religious leaders out of killing
[1:36:32] the apostles. And when when the
[1:36:34] scripture says in the Greek they were
[1:36:36] cut to the heart, it was that they were
[1:36:38] just like saw a sununder to be sawn
[1:36:41] through mentally and and and to be to be
[1:36:45] rent and torn with vexation. This wasn't
[1:36:48] something light, friends.
[1:36:51] This was something that were having an
[1:36:53] incredible effect upon people. But the
[1:36:56] apostles,
[1:36:58] it is like they were looked upon as
[1:37:00] having a mar having uh that they were
[1:37:04] identified
[1:37:06] as being ignorant men,
[1:37:09] raw to the point, saying that they
[1:37:13] couldn't put the message in a in a nice
[1:37:16] framework. You just had to tell it the
[1:37:18] way it was.
[1:37:20] Amen.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; We still need it.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; And then when Jesus
[1:37:26] was speaking, he said, "Many therefore
[1:37:29] of his disciples," these were believers
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; who had professed to believe on him.
[1:37:35] They were in church.
[1:37:38] He said, "Many therefore of his
[1:37:40] disciples when they heard this saying,
[1:37:43] or rather heard this, said, "This is a
[1:37:46] hard saying. Who can hear it?
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in Jehovah Gyra,
[1:37:52] the trouble of it is we have got so much
[1:37:55] Hollywood preaching and not enough
[1:37:58] oldtime rough preaching. I like the old
[1:38:00] time kind that really tears the hide off
[1:38:03] of you. Brings it down to a place where
[1:38:06] it belongs. Too much petting around. We
[1:38:09] need the oldfashioned gospel preached in
[1:38:12] its power of the resurrection of the
[1:38:14] Lord Jesus. That's what the world needs
[1:38:17] today. How many here can say amen to
[1:38:20] that?
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; But for saying those things, he was
[1:38:27] despised.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; It is Jesus Christ that's still being
[1:38:32] despised and rejected.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Said God doesn't need compromisers.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; God doesn't want his church to look like
[1:38:42] the world. He doesn't want it to act
[1:38:45] like the world. He doesn't want it to
[1:38:47] have anything to do with the world, only
[1:38:49] to preach the gospel to the world and to
[1:38:51] call those forth. God wants separators.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; The church wants mixers. They want a
[1:38:57] pastor who will not be so hard on them
[1:39:00] and tell them good things and not dig
[1:39:02] right down, just rake the hide off of
[1:39:05] them. Brother, that's what we need. And
[1:39:08] in this day, this is the thing we have
[1:39:10] to be so concerned about because
[1:39:13] everything around us, our entire
[1:39:15] environment and the prophet said that
[1:39:17] the pressure of this great age is soft
[1:39:19] living.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; It can be dangerous.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; So if you have it, use it for God's
[1:39:30] kingdom.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Whatever it might be, I say soft living
[1:39:34] is a flaw on this generation. Soft
[1:39:37] living is disfiguring this generation.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; And I believe whatever generation we are
[1:39:43] raised in, we can take that and use it
[1:39:45] for the glory of God. You got a home,
[1:39:48] use it for God's glory. Use it for
[1:39:51] hospitality. You got a car, use it when
[1:39:54] believers have need.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, use it for the glory of
[1:39:58] God.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Be faithful to the house of God.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Be faithful with your testimony.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; So I say once again repeating there are
[1:40:10] different aspects of wounding or to mar
[1:40:13] or to cause a flaw.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; I remind you again some are allowed by
[1:40:18] God and some are brought upon us by
[1:40:20] other people or circumstances
[1:40:23] and some are self-inflicted.
[1:40:28] Some are the results of nature.
[1:40:34] Fanny Crosby, born blind.
[1:40:38] I looked at others. There were great
[1:40:40] people. I won't even talk about them.
[1:40:42] Einstein couldn't hardly write
[1:40:45] much of his life.
[1:40:47] Very intelligent people. Stephven
[1:40:49] Hawking. I saw him here in Vancouver
[1:40:52] trying to speak through his computer uh
[1:40:56] dying with Lug Garrick's disease as it
[1:40:58] were. And yet one of the most brilliant
[1:41:01] minds if you saw his twisted up just
[1:41:05] such a hopeless helpless sight twisted
[1:41:09] up being wheeled in a wheelchair
[1:41:13] and and with this motorized chair I
[1:41:15] should say and and speaking one word and
[1:41:18] then another word and another word and
[1:41:20] taking questions from the taking
[1:41:23] questions from the people. several
[1:41:25] hundreds of people are there and yet the
[1:41:28] eyes of the world are on him because he
[1:41:30] has the most brilliant mind I guess
[1:41:32] since Einstein.
[1:41:35] I would say that not for Christ
[1:41:38] necessarily. I don't know what his
[1:41:40] belief is but he has not allowed that
[1:41:43] dreadful flaw and disfigurement in his
[1:41:47] life to hinder him from what was driving
[1:41:50] inside. Listen to me friends. We have
[1:41:53] something inside. If we're a believer,
[1:41:55] you have Christ inside. And now we need
[1:41:58] to listen to the inner man and let the
[1:42:00] inner man motivate us and drive us.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; To be a tool and a vessel for the
[1:42:08] kingdom, not for this world.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Don't serve this world. It's all passing
[1:42:14] away.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Serve it to live. Serve it to provide
[1:42:18] for your family. Serve it to pay your
[1:42:20] bills and do what you ever need to do.
[1:42:22] But don't sacrifice the house of God.
[1:42:25] Don't sacrifice your spiritual life
[1:42:28] before Christ.
[1:42:39] Jesus said
[1:42:42] as he was coming to the marring
[1:42:46] as he was coming now to be so brutalized
[1:42:50] that his visage would be marred more
[1:42:52] than that of any man. Can you believe
[1:42:54] that? Brother Brandham describes it and
[1:42:57] I tell you you want to have a strong
[1:42:59] stomach.
[1:43:03] But he said, "No man taketh," speaking
[1:43:05] of his life, taketh it from me, but I
[1:43:08] lay it down with myself. I have power to
[1:43:11] lay it down, and I have power to take it
[1:43:14] again. And this commandment I have
[1:43:16] received of my father.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "God gave his son.
[1:43:23] Jesus laid his own life down and yet men
[1:43:26] crucified him." So this is one where God
[1:43:30] and even brother Brandham says God
[1:43:32] smoked him
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; but actually in human form it was men
[1:43:38] that smokeote him but God was allowing
[1:43:40] them to smite him. God was allowing man
[1:43:43] to make the mar but God was actually
[1:43:46] responsible for the mar. God gave his
[1:43:48] son.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Now hold it close.
[1:43:55] Men thrust the thorns on his brow. Men
[1:43:58] drove the nails in his feet and hands,
[1:44:02] but God gave him to be the sacrifice. So
[1:44:06] God arranged it.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; And this flaw,
[1:44:11] this mar
[1:44:14] was not something that Jesus ran from.
[1:44:16] He ran to it.
[1:44:21] He'd be despised of men and considered
[1:44:24] smitten by God.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; But out of the flaw,
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; came a voice.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Out of the flaw came the blood that
[1:44:38] speaks better things than that of Abel.
[1:44:43] And the prophet, he dwells on it so much
[1:44:46] that when Michelangelo
[1:44:49] was finished with his his statue and his
[1:44:52] image of of Moses, he said it was so
[1:44:56] perfect when he saw the image that he
[1:44:59] had in his mind. And he said he worked
[1:45:01] for years and he labored for years and
[1:45:03] spent such a large part of his life and
[1:45:06] he saw it in his mind and all it was was
[1:45:08] a a block. It was just a a piece of
[1:45:11] stone. But in the stone, he saw an
[1:45:13] image. He saw Moses in the stone.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; And when he finally had it done and had
[1:45:19] it polished and and touched up here and
[1:45:22] there and and and and he thought that it
[1:45:24] was so real, it must speak. And he took
[1:45:26] his hammer and struck the knee and said,
[1:45:29] "Speak."
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham ties that over to
[1:45:33] Calvary when he finally saw an image
[1:45:36] here on earth. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, stay with me now, please. When he
[1:45:42] saw the image here on earth, he he he he
[1:45:45] didn't only desire a son. He desired a
[1:45:48] family.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; He desired a relationship that would be
[1:45:52] that of husband and wife.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; And you that have not experienced
[1:46:01] husband and wife relationship, let me
[1:46:03] tell you the relationship that the Lord
[1:46:06] Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost will take
[1:46:09] you into will supersede the husband wife
[1:46:12] human relationship.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; It can supersede it.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:46:22] Not just because I'm preaching it, but
[1:46:24] if you can say that
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; it supersedes it.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; God was looking up beyond the physical
[1:46:33] frame. He was looking beyond the
[1:46:36] physical when he said, "This is my
[1:46:39] beloved son in whom I'm well pleased."
[1:46:42] But when he led and he led that son the
[1:46:46] the the the dove leading the lamb and
[1:46:50] led him up to Calvary and beaten and uh
[1:46:54] and bloodied and finally he comes to
[1:46:56] Calvary and men who are breathing God's
[1:47:00] air
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; who have ate God's food
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; who God gives strength in their muscles
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; and they are the ones with the hammer
[1:47:11] and drove move the spikes and the one
[1:47:14] that took the spear and thrust his side.
[1:47:18] I've said it before and perhaps you
[1:47:19] can't understand it. He did us a favor.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Even the cruel Roman soldier did us a
[1:47:27] favor when he thrusted his side and out
[1:47:30] came blood and water. But the prophet
[1:47:32] said, "Of came spirit."
[1:47:37] The only spirit that can mingle with
[1:47:40] your spirit
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; for the first time in history and the
[1:47:48] last time in history.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Came out a spirit
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; out of a broken blood cell. He said the
[1:47:57] blood cell was broken and only that
[1:48:00] spirit can come into your spirit
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; and make you a new creature in Christ
[1:48:06] Jesus.
[1:48:07] [Applause]
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; But the prophet said you'll still have
[1:48:11] the sticky nature.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; And that's what I want to deal with as I
[1:48:15] go along. You'll still have the sticky
[1:48:18] nature. I say you might as well accept
[1:48:21] it. There's people who spend their
[1:48:24] entire life trying to get rid of it,
[1:48:27] trying to get rid of it. I'm not talking
[1:48:29] about sinful things. I'm talking about
[1:48:31] the the sticky nature.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; God knew you'd be born in a natural
[1:48:39] birth.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; God knew every footstep that you take.
[1:48:44] And some of you come from good homes and
[1:48:46] some come from very dysfunctional homes.
[1:48:51] And some come from very sad situations.
[1:49:00] And it's fine for me to go back back in
[1:49:02] the Bible
[1:49:06] and I've given some of my own testimony.
[1:49:07] Brother Brandham often told his life
[1:49:09] story
[1:49:11] and he told it in minute detail.
[1:49:25] Sister Debbie Kanye, I spoke to your
[1:49:27] husband
[1:49:30] years ago.
[1:49:32] Sister Debbie is many years ago. I
[1:49:35] couldn't even recall all the details. I
[1:49:37] won't go into all the details,
[1:49:41] but her and her sister, there was a
[1:49:44] number of children. I think another
[1:49:46] four, maybe about six
[1:49:48] children
[1:49:50] in a home with an alcoholic mother and
[1:49:53] alcoholic father.
[1:49:55] And the children are put out into foster
[1:49:57] homes
[1:49:59] and the whole family is essentially
[1:50:01] disbanded.
[1:50:04] And she talked with me and said, "I I
[1:50:06] want to make contact with my family
[1:50:10] and we've been separated all these years
[1:50:12] and certain members of the family
[1:50:16] and and she was so burdened. I could see
[1:50:18] she was just so crushed.
[1:50:22] Now, that sister sits here. I'm not
[1:50:24] talking about 3,000 years ago, 4,000
[1:50:26] years ago. And every one of you here
[1:50:31] have something that you're carrying
[1:50:37] and you wish it could be different.
[1:50:40] And I'm going to say, take the situation
[1:50:44] where you are and where you find
[1:50:47] yourself
[1:50:48] and say, "God,
[1:50:51] I give it to you.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; I will not surrender up any of my
[1:50:56] spiritual Christian standards or walk.
[1:51:00] Let my sentence come from your presence,
[1:51:03] but I will. I give it to you. I will not
[1:51:06] let it intimidate me. I will not let it
[1:51:09] stand in my way. I give it to you.
[1:51:12] Whatever that thing is, whatever
[1:51:14] whatever arrangement I came out of.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; And I saw that Sister Debbie was so
[1:51:21] burdened and crushed over this. And when
[1:51:24] do you think it goes away? It doesn't go
[1:51:25] away.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; You think about it at night. You think
[1:51:29] about it when you lay down in bed. You
[1:51:30] think about it while you're working,
[1:51:32] while you're busy, while you're active,
[1:51:33] while you're doing things. You're
[1:51:35] thinking about it. It's always there
[1:51:37] because it's you.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Not talking about what's in your nature.
[1:51:42] I'm talking about circumstances.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; And the circumstances may be those that
[1:51:48] you didn't were were imposed upon you.
[1:51:50] There may be others that were
[1:51:52] self-inflicted choices that you made. Uh
[1:51:55] we have David's case. We have other
[1:51:57] cases in the scripture which it was not
[1:51:59] the people's fault that they were
[1:52:01] birthed into. It
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; wasn't Sister Debbie's fault. And mother
[1:52:06] and father are both alcoholics. She had
[1:52:08] nothing to do with the fact that they
[1:52:10] went out to foster homes, different
[1:52:12] foster homes, and she doesn't have
[1:52:14] contact. And now she comes into the
[1:52:16] message, and she wishes that they they
[1:52:18] could hear the same gospel. She hears.
[1:52:22] Amen.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; To make a long story short, and I won't
[1:52:25] go into it, just a year or so ago, I was
[1:52:28] able to meet Sister Debbie,
[1:52:32] her sister, older sister, and her
[1:52:36] husband, and both have come into the
[1:52:39] message.
[1:52:40] [Music]
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; I want to pass a bouquet to brother Mike
[1:52:44] and sister Debbie,
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; and it never has entered my mind.
[1:52:50] It has never come to mind. But as I was
[1:52:52] studying and I put it down and Debbie,
[1:52:54] your your name came up and then I pushed
[1:52:57] it away and then it came up again. I
[1:52:59] pushed it away and it came up and so I
[1:53:01] felt I have to say something and then it
[1:53:04] seemed like the Holy Spirit spoke to me
[1:53:06] and said she took a flaw. She took a
[1:53:09] mar. took the burden uh oppressive
[1:53:12] condition from her life but didn't let
[1:53:14] it affect
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; her spiritual walk
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; and her service to God and God has
[1:53:22] brought now the older sister and her
[1:53:23] husband and it just seemed like the Holy
[1:53:26] Spirit said to me
[1:53:28] they the scientists say that the world
[1:53:30] is that the universe is expanding and
[1:53:33] for the first time I thought maybe that
[1:53:35] is right because as people are birthed
[1:53:38] into the family of God, he throws
[1:53:40] another world out there or another
[1:53:42] 10,000 worlds.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; And I said, "God bless you, Sister
[1:53:47] Debbie." 20,000 planets went into space
[1:53:51] when they went into into God's kingdom.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why not?
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "One soul is worth
[1:53:59] 10,000 worlds."
[1:54:02] That's not some poetic language. That's
[1:54:04] the truth. Amen.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; I'm here today to declare you live your
[1:54:09] life for God. Regardless of your past or
[1:54:12] regardless of what you suffered or
[1:54:14] regardless of your situation, don't let
[1:54:17] Satan poke anything down that memory
[1:54:19] channel.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; If I was standing here
[1:54:33] and I'm bringing it home
[1:54:36] and you knew me to have slept with a
[1:54:38] woman
[1:54:43] and that she bore a child as a result of
[1:54:46] it
[1:54:49] and God killed that child.
[1:54:54] I don't think you would want me to be a
[1:54:56] pastor.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; I don't think you'd want to hear me
[1:55:00] speak
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; because your eyes would be on the flaw.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; And David could have just kept looking
[1:55:12] at the flaw as well and saying, "Look
[1:55:15] what's happened to my life. I' I've
[1:55:17] ruined it. I'm I'm good for nothing."
[1:55:22] God still saw him as one of the greatest
[1:55:24] kings of the Bible and he wouldn't
[1:55:26] change it.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; I'm not suggesting that I have committed
[1:55:30] such a sin. I can in fact say I've been
[1:55:33] I've been true and I've lived a clean
[1:55:35] pristine life and the only woman I've
[1:55:37] known is my wife.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; I say that for the glory of God. But let
[1:55:41] me say this. This might not be the
[1:55:43] testimony of other people but I am no
[1:55:45] purer than you and you're and and
[1:55:48] brother Brandham is no purer than
[1:55:49] anybody. The blood of Jesus Christ
[1:55:52] cleanses and erases every transgression.
[1:55:58] So to you that may have self-inflicted
[1:56:00] wounds,
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; let me tell you that the that the Christ
[1:56:05] of this gospel
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; erases and the prophet furthermore says
[1:56:11] that when your confessed sin drops into
[1:56:14] the bleach, he said it actually becomes
[1:56:17] bleach.
[1:56:22] That's beyond our comprehension.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; And then there are others that are
[1:56:28] imposed upon you.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Sister Debbie that chose my
[1:56:33] parents should be alcoholics. It wasn't
[1:56:35] you that chose that your situation would
[1:56:38] be what it is. Some of you are single
[1:56:40] parents. It wasn't you that chose your
[1:56:42] husband or wife would depart you and
[1:56:44] leave you. It wasn't you that chose
[1:56:46] certain things would be a certain way.
[1:56:48] I'm saying if the reason why God, hear
[1:56:52] me good now. The reason why God so loved
[1:56:55] David, it was because God could set his
[1:56:58] sentence on his act and David would
[1:57:01] accept it, but he would say, "This will
[1:57:04] not hinder me. I will not let this
[1:57:06] impair my love for God.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; I will not let it stand in my way."
[1:57:16] And that was so complete
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; that God allowed and predetermined that
[1:57:23] Ba Sheba would bring forth Solomon
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; who was a type of Jesus Christ.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; And under Solomon he the prophet said
[1:57:33] Israel essentially had a millennium.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; That kind of God we don't know very much
[1:57:44] about. Amen.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; In case anybody thinks you don't have a
[1:57:52] flaw,
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; don't
[1:57:56] don't be too self assured
[1:57:59] for when the scratch comes.
[1:58:02] when the flaw comes.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; How I thank God for clean lives and how
[1:58:08] I thank God for lives that haven't, like
[1:58:11] Brother Brandham said, I might have been
[1:58:13] further down the road.
[1:58:18] I just want to say I don't care what has
[1:58:20] happened in your life. I don't care
[1:58:22] where you came from.
[1:58:26] The God that I serve and the God that is
[1:58:28] present here today knows precisely
[1:58:31] your situation. He knows what has caused
[1:58:34] it, what has created it. He has watched
[1:58:36] you every step you've taken. And he is
[1:58:40] saying right here this morning through
[1:58:42] my lips that you turn your life, you
[1:58:45] give what you have to him. That's all he
[1:58:47] wants.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; He's not wanting a bunch of bunch of
[1:58:51] works. He doesn't need a bunch of things
[1:58:53] so you he can justify you. He just wants
[1:58:55] you to surrender your life. the talents
[1:58:58] that he's given you, the gifts that he's
[1:59:00] given you, just turn them back to God.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't be reduced to a
[1:59:06] churchgoer.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't merely become
[1:59:11] religious.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, are you hearing me?
[1:59:15] Don't turn this message into a
[1:59:17] tradition.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, now we're so happy we're believers
[1:59:21] that we just live nice little lives and
[1:59:23] go to church and so on. Don't do that.
[1:59:26] Say, "Here I am.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Speak, Lord. What do you want me to do?
[1:59:30] What do you want me to be?"
[1:59:32] [Music]
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; And don't forget this message.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Flaws.
[1:59:46] And then in the beginning was the word
[1:59:47] and the word was with God. And the word
[1:59:50] was heed out
[1:59:53] and reflected what the word was at the
[1:59:55] beginning him.
[1:59:58] The word reflected in the masterpiece in
[2:00:01] his own likeness. God back again in his
[2:00:04] own likeness.
[2:00:06] The word form being reflected in the
[2:00:09] image of a man, the masterpiece.
[2:00:13] And he said, "All prophets had flaws."
[2:00:18] Now,
[2:00:21] I'm kind of jumping all over, but you
[2:00:23] forgive me. I'm just
[2:00:27] so moved.
[2:00:29] I'm having a hard time delivering this
[2:00:31] to you.
[2:00:33] I've talked a lot of you
[2:00:38] and I know the burdens you bear. You
[2:00:42] surrender it up to God.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; The scripture says
[2:00:51] that when God saw Jesus
[2:00:54] the father, the word now in flesh, and a
[2:00:58] voice spoke,
[2:01:00] "This is my son
[2:01:03] in whom I'm pleased." And on Mount
[2:01:06] Transfiguration, a cloud covered him in
[2:01:09] a voice. This is my son. Hear ye him.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:14] But the prophet and I'm so thankful for
[2:01:16] the message. The prophet said that when
[2:01:19] uh when Michelangelo and he's he's
[2:01:21] bringing it right up to the present time
[2:01:23] when he saw the sun when he saw his
[2:01:26] image and when God saw his image because
[2:01:29] there was something he saw on Calvary
[2:01:31] that he didn't see while Jesus was
[2:01:33] walking and coming out of the water. He
[2:01:36] saw something on Calvary and the prophet
[2:01:39] is bringing to us so clear and he takes
[2:01:41] a hammer and now God is allowing it and
[2:01:45] struck the image and when the image was
[2:01:48] struck the blood cell of God
[2:01:53] the the the beginning of the new
[2:01:55] creation. Please grasp this
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; the image the beginning of the new
[2:02:00] creation the blood cell
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; that had been in the womb of Mary.
[2:02:05] Hallelujah.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Which was a creation of God.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; The beginning of a new creation. The
[2:02:10] blood cell broke and God saw his family.
[2:02:15] [Music]
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; God saw you.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; I can prove it to you.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; He asked through He asked through
[2:02:24] Isaiah, "Where's my family? Where's my
[2:02:28] household that you build to me?"
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; In other words, where's my family?
[2:02:33] Where's my household?
[2:02:35] The heavens my hand has made. The earth
[2:02:37] is my foottool. But where's the house
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; that you build me? Not a building, not
[2:02:43] cedar, not stones. Where's the house?
[2:02:47] You look at in the Hebrew. Where's my
[2:02:48] household? Where's my children? Where's
[2:02:50] my sons? Where's my wife? Where's my
[2:02:53] household?
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Where's this kind of relationship? God
[2:02:59] doesn't need gold. He doesn't need
[2:03:01] silver. He doesn't need your offering.
[2:03:03] He doesn't need your tithes. He doesn't
[2:03:05] need anything. He just wants you.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; He wants that spirit that's in you that
[2:03:12] his the life from his blood cell came
[2:03:15] and mingled with your spirit and made
[2:03:17] you a son and daughter of God.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; And that life is so powerful.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; It can control the sticky nature.
[2:03:30] Amen.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; I've got something. You've got something
[2:03:37] greater than your sticky nature.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; He said he got so inspired.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; And I just it was as though I could see
[2:03:49] God, the almighty one. All of his focus
[2:03:54] now is on what's happening on on this
[2:03:57] hill called Mount Calvary. called Goth.
[2:04:01] And when he sees and and finally that
[2:04:03] son is so battered, he saw Isaiah and
[2:04:08] what he spoke to Isaiah, it's all been
[2:04:10] passed, all been fulfilled. He sees it
[2:04:12] right before him. A lamb, a bleeding
[2:04:15] lamb, and it's so perfect because he
[2:04:17] knows this is the answer.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; And he struck it.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; And out come the blood and the spirit.
[2:04:26] The blood went to the earth and the
[2:04:28] spirit ascended. It's the spirit of God
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; to come back into the believer.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; That's why we speak so forcefully on the
[2:04:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And you're
[2:04:40] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[2:04:43] the remission of sins. And you shall
[2:04:46] connecting word and you shall receive
[2:04:48] the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[2:04:51] It's not some man laying hands on you
[2:04:53] and making you to utter some words.
[2:04:55] That's not it.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; It's him who said, "You be baptized and
[2:05:00] you shall be filled with the Holy
[2:05:02] Ghost."
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; And you'll have God,
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; living inside of a sticky nature.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon was even asked a
[2:05:13] question when Apostle Paul said, "When I
[2:05:16] would do good, evil is present with me.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; And what I would do, I do not. The good
[2:05:23] that I would do, I do not. And the evil
[2:05:26] that I would not, I do.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; And a man asked a question in questions
[2:05:31] and answers. He said, "This I don't
[2:05:32] understand."
[2:05:34] Brother Brandham said, "Well, it's a
[2:05:36] cockle bur with a wheat seed in it."
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; With wheat life in it.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; But God got so inspired
[2:05:53] And the prophet kept saying it. He
[2:05:55] struck it
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; and cried, "Speak."
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say anything. But the blood
[2:06:02] spoke.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; The blood cried out, "The price is
[2:06:06] paid."
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; The blood cried out, "Redemption is
[2:06:11] complete."
[2:06:13] [Applause]
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; The blood cried out, "Here is the
[2:06:17] family.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Here's the family of God."
[2:06:22] And our prophet of God said, "You were
[2:06:24] there
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; in him at Calvary."
[2:06:29] Do you believe that? You were there.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Call your name out. Say, "I was there."
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; On Calvary,
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; When the blood spoke out,
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; this is redemption.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Not half, not 90%. This is redemption.
[2:06:54] You've never heard me say what I'm
[2:06:56] saying.
[2:06:58] If I committed the sins of David,
[2:07:02] you wouldn't want to be here.
[2:07:06] Your human reasoning just wouldn't quite
[2:07:08] allow it.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; But you see, you would be, I'm really
[2:07:13] coming down. You'd be looking at the
[2:07:16] flaw,
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; not at what you could do with it.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; And what David did with it,
[2:07:34] he accepted the sentence of God.
[2:07:38] You should read the Psalms now after
[2:07:41] this service.
[2:07:44] It was what he did with it. If you
[2:07:46] focused with what he did with it,
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; then you would understand.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, we have the Holy
[2:07:52] Spirit now." That's right. But we have
[2:07:54] some of the same flaws.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; We have some of the same,
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; weighty,
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; burdensome,
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; crushing, oppressive.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Mars in our life.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; I've been born this way. I've been born
[2:08:13] in a certain country. I've been born
[2:08:15] with a certain home. I've had a mess of
[2:08:18] my life.
[2:08:20] Tell you what, God's not looking at the
[2:08:22] mess.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; He's looking at what he provided to fix
[2:08:26] it.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm speaking today.
[2:08:34] Amen.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Furthermore, I have come
[2:08:37] not
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; those that are not sick, they don't need
[2:08:44] a physician."
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Those that are righteous don't need
[2:08:49] Christ.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "I have come. I have come
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; for those that are sick.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Those that recognize, I need a savior.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; I need a total redemption.
[2:09:03] I need the life that came out. I need
[2:09:05] the blood that speaks better things
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; than evil.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; I need a voice that says, "You're
[2:09:12] forgiven."
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; I need a voice that says,
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; "Lay your life down.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; Give me
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; your heart."
[2:09:31] God got so inspired.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul carried a flaw. He even
[2:09:37] mentions it.
[2:09:40] He said,
[2:09:43] "I stood
[2:09:45] when Timothy was being martyed."
[2:09:50] And furthermore, they laid his clothes
[2:09:52] at my feet.
[2:09:55] And I stood there and I never said a
[2:09:57] word against it.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; First church heritage messenger.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; If you look at his flaw,
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; you'll have a hard time seeing really
[2:10:08] what he achieved in his life.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I blasphemed.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; I was a blasphemer, but I did it
[2:10:15] ignorantly.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; I didn't know any better.
[2:10:24] That's not people.
[2:10:27] I've heard things said about believers.
[2:10:30] And whatever you do with those that have
[2:10:33] found fellowship elsewhere and gone
[2:10:35] elsewhere, be careful what you say about
[2:10:37] them.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; Leave it in the hands of God.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; I've heard things and I've said that's
[2:10:43] so close to blasphemy against the Holy
[2:10:45] Spirit.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; They walk on such dangerous grounds.
[2:10:52] When we speak about one another, we
[2:10:54] speak about how they've lived or what
[2:10:57] has happened to them. I can tell you one
[2:11:00] thing, a surrendered life, God is
[2:11:03] looking at what you will do with thy
[2:11:04] flaw.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Moses said, "I can't speak." God says,
[2:11:08] "I'll have you to speak."
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I'll give my whole law
[2:11:13] to you. You'll be the first prophet, and
[2:11:15] I'll give your whole law. And no man
[2:11:18] will speak with God like you're going to
[2:11:19] like I'm going to speak with you. Amen.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; And he came down
[2:11:25] and was a mouthpiece, brother Ernie, of
[2:11:27] Almighty Quad.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; But it was coarse.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; It was hard. He was of slow laborious,
[2:11:35] not slow in length of speaking. It It
[2:11:38] was laborious. And he just had to say
[2:11:40] it. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not
[2:11:44] commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; And he just laid it out there, right?
[2:11:52] And some of the people could handle it
[2:11:53] and some couldn't.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; That did not change his status with God.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Your flaw,
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; I'm here to say your flaw, whatever it
[2:12:06] might be, does not change your call or
[2:12:10] your status with God. Can you say amen
[2:12:13] to that? Why don't you say thank you
[2:12:15] Lord Jesus?
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:18] [Music]
[2:12:20] Amen.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; And don't spend your life trying to get
[2:12:23] rid of it. Don't spend your life being
[2:12:25] bitter about it.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; Just say, "I am who I am,
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; and I give it to Christ. I give it all
[2:12:32] to Christ." Amen.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "I get up to
[2:12:48] preach."
[2:12:49] You know, I'm not a preacher
[2:12:52] with this my Kentucky grammar and the
[2:12:55] his and the haint and all those words.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; I love it.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; So, I can't say this.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. what we call a modern preacher
[2:13:02] today.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; I couldn't take its place. I couldn't
[2:13:07] take that place because I have no
[2:13:10] education.
[2:13:16] Came out of a meeting and there were
[2:13:18] children standing there and a little boy
[2:13:22] wanted his autograph.
[2:13:24] Said, "I can't even read my own writing.
[2:13:28] How are they going to do it? I'm giving
[2:13:31] you a little bit of a taste
[2:13:33] of what you think that he didn't labor
[2:13:36] under that
[2:13:41] his childhood despised and no one wanted
[2:13:44] to even walk on the same side of the
[2:13:46] street. You think he didn't remember
[2:13:48] that? Yeah, he remembered that cuz he
[2:13:50] told about it.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; It was in his mind.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; And the Brandham name and how it was
[2:13:56] turned down. And he says, "Now I got
[2:13:58] friends all over the world. left to run
[2:14:00] to hide.
[2:14:05] Then he said, "Dear friends,
[2:14:08] I'm not young like you all this morning,
[2:14:12] but I'm old and I've been through many
[2:14:15] hard battles. And by going through those
[2:14:18] hard battles
[2:14:20] brings you where you are this morning."
[2:14:24] He said, "You see, so I'm sure you
[2:14:27] understand that God has put me God has
[2:14:31] put me through it."
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Every person here needs to say that same
[2:14:40] thing.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; God has put me through that.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; He said that. And there is a reason that
[2:14:49] my life might open up a way and say this
[2:14:54] is it.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; Some of you
[2:15:01] maybe been hiding
[2:15:03] behind your flaw.
[2:15:06] Well, you know, I'm kind of shame. This
[2:15:09] is my home or this is my family or this
[2:15:12] is my background and I'm kind of strange
[2:15:16] and the kids at school, they kind of
[2:15:18] make fun and my family's kind of looked
[2:15:22] down on for this reason or that reason
[2:15:25] or a whole multitude of reasons. We kind
[2:15:28] of hide behind. I say come out from
[2:15:29] behind that bush.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; Come out from behind that excuse. Yeah.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; So, I am what I am
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; and I give it to the glory of God.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; I'll believe the word. I'll live
[2:15:43] according to the word. But I give my
[2:15:45] life to God.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; I will glorify him one way or another.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; But Satan shall not rob me of my
[2:15:52] opportunity in this life.
[2:15:55] [Applause]
[2:15:55] [Music]
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; And I'll do what I can. I'll do
[2:15:59] everything I can to live a life that is
[2:16:01] a a credit to this gospel.
[2:16:15] sticky old nature.
[2:16:18] When I say sticky, right away you think
[2:16:20] of something that clings and adheres to
[2:16:22] you.
[2:16:24] That's right.
[2:16:27] It does. I've been trying to get rid of
[2:16:30] it for 76 years. Excuse me. 75. And I
[2:16:34] got to back that up a couple before I
[2:16:35] found out what I was like. So for a lot
[2:16:38] of get rid of that,
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; you know, then you get down say, "Oh
[2:16:43] god, I just failed. I'm such a failure.
[2:16:46] I just I think I'll just throw it in the
[2:16:48] towel."
[2:16:50] And the devil's just standing there and
[2:16:51] say, "Do it. Do it. Throw in the towel.
[2:16:55] Give up, you wretch."
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Isn't that the truth?
[2:17:04] You need to remember it's not the flaw.
[2:17:07] It's not that old hindrance. It's not
[2:17:09] that old sticky nature that I'm going to
[2:17:11] give whatever I am.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; I'll let God deal with the sticky
[2:17:15] nature.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:17:27] now I got a surprise for you. You might
[2:17:30] be saying, "Well, thank goodness
[2:17:32] something's going to come out of this
[2:17:33] service."
[2:17:37] You know what?
[2:17:39] It's that weakness, that inherent
[2:17:42] weakness. It's that frailty. It's that
[2:17:45] thing that troubles you all the time
[2:17:47] that keeps driving you on.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; And if you didn't have it, you wouldn't
[2:17:53] be driven on. You wouldn't go to your
[2:17:55] knees and say, "Oh, God, deliver me. Oh
[2:17:58] God, forgive me. Oh God, help me once
[2:18:01] more. I'm so This has happened so many
[2:18:03] times, but please, just once more.
[2:18:07] And that kind of motivation is going to
[2:18:10] put you right into the rapture.
[2:18:16] That's the truth. Right into the
[2:18:17] rapture.
[2:18:20] And when you got on the other side,
[2:18:22] you'll say, "Thank God for the flaw. If
[2:18:25] I didn't have the flaw, if I hadn't got
[2:18:28] that mar, if I wasn't born that way, I'd
[2:18:31] have just lapsed back. Hey, there's a
[2:18:33] lot of people that got the same
[2:18:34] conditions and circumstances you and it
[2:18:36] doesn't bother. They just they have
[2:18:37] another drink.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Just smoke some pot and forget all about
[2:18:44] it.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; It doesn't bother them, but it bothers a
[2:18:48] son and daughter of God. It bothers us.
[2:18:52] Hallelujah.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; The waring of the flesh. The scripture
[2:19:01] says, "For the flesh lusteth or desires
[2:19:05] and wars against the spirit, and the
[2:19:08] spirit against the flesh." I thank God
[2:19:10] for that one. The flesh is lusting
[2:19:12] against that life. It has all kinds of
[2:19:14] other desires. But the spirit,
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; the spirit that came out of Calvary The
[2:19:23] spirit that came out of Jesus is in you.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; And that spirit is stronger
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; than the sticky nature. It's stronger
[2:19:34] than the flaw.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; Your past,
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; the spirit that came out, Satan's
[2:19:46] looking, pointing at you, pointing at
[2:19:47] you, look at your past. But the spirit
[2:19:50] has a voice. And the spirit is saying
[2:19:53] you're forgiven.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; The spirit is saying it's under the
[2:19:56] blood.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; And I don't know if I can speak on
[2:19:59] behalf of God, but I believe God's
[2:20:01] saying, "Amen."
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; That's why I was so inspired. I saw them
[2:20:07] forgiven.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; I saw them as my family. I saw them as
[2:20:13] the blood washed.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:20] Hallelujah.
[2:20:27] No wonder he was inspired.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; So I have this and I want to give it to
[2:20:34] you as a phrase. The waring of the flesh
[2:20:37] against the spirit just makes us more
[2:20:42] resolved,
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; more determined to sacrifice and lay our
[2:20:48] lives down for the cause of Jesus
[2:20:51] Christ.
[2:20:52] Amen.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; He would like you to become
[2:20:57] affected and atrophied. Say, "Well, I
[2:21:00] because I'm this or because I'm that or
[2:21:03] because this happened to me because I I
[2:21:05] guess I can't do anything." You tell him
[2:21:07] he's a liar.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; You can do lots for the kingdom.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; I speak to every man, woman, and child
[2:21:13] here. You can do lots for the kingdom.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; And you must.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; Is it not an option?
[2:21:23] Amen.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; For though we walk in the flesh, we do
[2:21:27] not war after. Can I have a few more
[2:21:29] minutes?
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Though we walk in the flesh, we do not
[2:21:32] war according to or after the flesh. We
[2:21:36] do not war as our mind would tell us or
[2:21:38] as a human would be. For the weapons of
[2:21:41] our warfare are not cornal, but mighty
[2:21:44] through God to the pulling down of
[2:21:46] strongholds.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; And Paul said in Romans, "Who shall lay
[2:21:49] anything? Anything.
[2:21:53] Say that with me. Anything. Who shall
[2:21:56] lay anything
[2:21:58] against
[2:22:00] lay anything to the charge of God's
[2:22:03] elect? It is God that justifyth.
[2:22:07] It was God's blood cell that was broken
[2:22:10] at Calvary.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; Who is he that condemnth?
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; And even yourself. You don't have a
[2:22:18] right to condemn what God has justified.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; Don't belittle Calvary.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Don't give Satan any credit.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ
[2:22:38] that died, yay, rather that is risen.
[2:22:41] Who is even at the right hand of God?
[2:22:44] Who who also maketh intercession for us?
[2:22:49] Shall the flaw of tribulation,
[2:22:53] distress,
[2:22:55] persecution,
[2:22:57] famine, nakedness, every one of those is
[2:23:00] a service within themselves.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul said,
[2:23:06] "Who shall separate us from the from the
[2:23:08] love of Christ? Shall tribulation, I'll
[2:23:11] say the flaw of tribulation."
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. None of us want tribulation, but
[2:23:16] you got it.
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; You will have it sometime. There will be
[2:23:20] a scratch no matter how blessed and
[2:23:23] perfect your life and home is.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; You may live the most pristine life.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; Look at the prophet of God. Absolutely
[2:23:31] flawless life.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; But there was all kinds of things that
[2:23:36] have been said and continue to be said
[2:23:38] against him
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; and against us
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; who bear the message. Yes.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; Shall tribulation
[2:23:47] or distress, you have distress
[2:23:52] or persecution
[2:23:54] or famine or nakedness
[2:23:57] or the flaw of peril or the flaw of the
[2:24:00] sword.
[2:24:02] As it is written, for thy sake we are
[2:24:04] killed all the day long. We are we are
[2:24:08] accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
[2:24:10] Nay, in all these things we are more
[2:24:12] than conquerors.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; And I want this congregation to repeat
[2:24:16] with the Apostle Paul. We are more than
[2:24:19] conquerors. Say it again. We are more
[2:24:21] than conquerors through him
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; that loved us and he demonstrated that
[2:24:27] love at Calvary when the spirit left him
[2:24:30] to come into you.
[2:24:42] I'm going to stop now.
[2:24:46] I'll just take these few minutes.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; I wanted to speak on the inspiration of
[2:24:51] his vision.
[2:24:54] Maybe I'll take just a few moments to
[2:24:56] highlight it. Amen.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; For we,
[2:25:02] all that are here,
[2:25:04] all that are streaming, all that have
[2:25:06] been bloodwashed, we are his
[2:25:09] workmanship.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; Created in Christ,
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; unto good works, which God hath before
[2:25:20] ordained, that we shall walk in them. No
[2:25:22] wonder he got inspired.
[2:25:25] No wonder God God inspired. It wasn't
[2:25:28] the Romans or the Jews that killed him.
[2:25:30] God became inspired.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; God bruised him.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; God bruised him to get you out.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; To bring you to this time.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; I hope I don't sound repetitious.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; We're his workmanship.
[2:25:52] Brother Brandham says back yonder and
[2:25:54] sometimes we don't let your mind become
[2:25:59] just uh like what I've heard that
[2:26:01] before. Keep it in perspective with what
[2:26:03] I'm saying.
[2:26:06] before the foundation of the world,
[2:26:09] before he took this old sun, and he
[2:26:12] moved it around this old star, this
[2:26:14] earth that we're living on now, this
[2:26:17] earth, and he molded it over here by the
[2:26:20] sun and laid it around the sun, and he
[2:26:23] molded it on this side and let her hang
[2:26:26] there for a hundred billion years.
[2:26:30] What was he making? Some gases.
[2:26:33] And he moved on around to this side and
[2:26:35] he made something else.
[2:26:38] What was he making there? Some pot ash.
[2:26:40] And he moved around this way. And what
[2:26:42] was he doing? He was making some
[2:26:44] calcium. What was he doing? He was
[2:26:47] making you and me.
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; I just want to ask you something.
[2:26:52] If God spent perhaps a few billion
[2:26:56] years
[2:26:58] to make this
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; here so that we could live
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; for 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 years.
[2:27:09] And he did that for the calcium
[2:27:12] that he put in the earth and the
[2:27:14] petroleum and the pot ash and so on. So
[2:27:16] we could live here and have a little
[2:27:18] expression. Do you think he wearies
[2:27:23] with shaping
[2:27:25] that inside person
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; and he molds? He knows that flaw is
[2:27:29] there. He let you even be born with it.
[2:27:32] He let you be born in such a kind of
[2:27:34] family. He knew even those things that
[2:27:36] are self-inflicted. He knew those things
[2:27:39] that we would do, those sins or those
[2:27:41] things we would commit, those things
[2:27:42] that we even ask forgiveness. And Satan
[2:27:44] doesn't want you to forget it because
[2:27:46] that that kind of thing is in the blood.
[2:27:48] He doesn't want anything that comes from
[2:27:49] the blood. He'll be sure and resurrect
[2:27:51] everything. Keep it right fresh in your
[2:27:52] mind like it happened yesterday.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; Say, "I can't even see that. God can't
[2:27:57] see it.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; It's in the blood. It's under the blood.
[2:28:00] It's gone."
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; And somebody might say, "Well, you know,
[2:28:07] how was it confessed or how did you
[2:28:09] confess it?" That's between you and God.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; That's none of my business. That's
[2:28:13] between you and God.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; And then you just say with David. Say
[2:28:17] with David, let your sentence come. Let
[2:28:20] my sentence come from your presence.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; I don't want to hear it from the church.
[2:28:24] I don't want to hear it from a preacher.
[2:28:26] I don't want to hear it from some good
[2:28:28] people. I want my sentence to come from
[2:28:30] you.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; And if you if you've done it, then you
[2:28:35] can prosper my life. You can allow the
[2:28:37] life of Christ to live in me. I only
[2:28:39] desire here's my life, Lord.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; And let him do the rest. Amen.
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; And it's amazing how he'll start
[2:28:46] confirming it.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; Forgive me.
[2:29:07] A minister said to brother Brandham
[2:29:10] in the masterpiece, he said, "Why is it
[2:29:13] that you're always balling the people
[2:29:15] out? Those people believe you to be a
[2:29:18] servant of God, to be gentle and sweet
[2:29:21] to them and everything." said, "Every
[2:29:24] time I hear you get up, you're balling
[2:29:26] the women out about having short hair or
[2:29:29] about wearing shorts or wearing makeup
[2:29:31] and balling the people out and telling
[2:29:33] them how cold and formal and different
[2:29:35] they are." Said, "Why do you do that?"
[2:29:38] He said, "How can you be?" And he said,
[2:29:41] "How can you be a loving son of God and
[2:29:44] do a thing like that?" And I said, "Sir,
[2:29:48] did did you ever read about the
[2:29:52] great composer Beethoven?"
[2:29:56] He said he probably tore up
[2:29:59] wasteful baskets,
[2:30:02] waste baskets full of scrap paper, but
[2:30:06] he gave the world a masterpiece.
[2:30:15] You know where we are
[2:30:18] and what you see. I've never said this
[2:30:20] before, but it came so powerful to my
[2:30:24] own heart.
[2:30:26] We're living in a world. This world is
[2:30:28] God's. It's a waste basket.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; It's full of crumpled
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; paper of things. That's not the plan of
[2:30:38] God. when your flaw or or your past or
[2:30:42] whatever more was done, there was a time
[2:30:45] God crumpled up the paper and threw it
[2:30:47] in a waste basket.
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; And he's going to dump this waste basket
[2:30:52] out.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; It's going to be so thorough. Stay with
[2:30:57] me in my little language now. It's going
[2:30:59] to be so thorough and so complete that
[2:31:02] he's even going to send a holy fire, the
[2:31:04] prophet said, and burn the heavens where
[2:31:06] the demon spirits have lodged
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; and come down to tempt you and to give
[2:31:11] you a a terrible life.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; And those hordes of hell
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; that have played on your mind. I'm not
[2:31:20] preaching to somebody outside of this
[2:31:22] building. I'm preaching to you here or
[2:31:24] you that are in the in the streaming
[2:31:26] congregation at the hordes of hell that
[2:31:28] come and don't tell me they don't talk
[2:31:30] to you. They talk to you like they talk
[2:31:31] to me.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; And we have things that if you could do
[2:31:39] it over, you'd go back and do it again.
[2:31:41] Forget it.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; Say, I acknowledge the flaw.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; I acknowledge the sticky nature. It
[2:31:48] isn't that I just cave in say, well,
[2:31:49] that's the way I am. I got a temper. and
[2:31:51] I can't do anything about it. It's not
[2:31:53] that the life that is in you is greater
[2:31:55] than that temper, greater than that
[2:31:58] temptation, you know, but you may not
[2:32:00] ever get rid of you will never get rid
[2:32:01] of the temptation. And we got things
[2:32:03] that are, you know, we each want to have
[2:32:06] little quirks.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; I guess I'm the only one.
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:32:18] not praise the Lord that we all have
[2:32:19] quirks, but we do have.
[2:32:25] And after speaking, he said he probably
[2:32:27] tore up waste baskets full of scrap
[2:32:30] paper and he gave the world a
[2:32:32] masterpiece when he was sitting in his
[2:32:34] study. Under the inspiration, notice
[2:32:36] under the inspiration, God was so
[2:32:39] inspired, he spoke, "This is my beloved
[2:32:42] son. There is none other. This is my
[2:32:44] beloved son in whom I'm pleased to
[2:32:47] dwell. This is my beloved son. Here he
[2:32:50] on the cross when he saw that image,
[2:32:53] that perfect son paying the price, he
[2:32:56] struck him and said, "Speak.
[2:33:06] He did speak and that blood is speaking.
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; listen while I come to a close
[2:33:16] &gt;&gt; and he he he got under under inspiration
[2:33:18] and he write something down and he go
[2:33:20] into a study and pray it wasn't right.
[2:33:23] He'd scrap it and throw it in the basket
[2:33:25] waste basket. Look at the earth was
[2:33:28] filled with violence
[2:33:31] and men and women they just didn't even
[2:33:33] get married. Men took women and the
[2:33:37] earth was filled with violence
[2:33:38] &gt;&gt; and it was filled with pleasure and God,
[2:33:41] the Bible says God repented himself.
[2:33:44] They even made the earth. What did he
[2:33:46] do? He took it that first creation and
[2:33:49] crumbled it all up and got throw this in
[2:33:51] the waste basket.
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; And all the time down through the
[2:33:56] centuries,
[2:33:57] man, even Israel, they failed. went into
[2:34:01] bondage, corrupted themselves, bowed
[2:34:03] down to images, bowed down to false
[2:34:07] gods, offered their children, and burnt
[2:34:09] them.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; Now, that's something,
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; I've never been able to understand that.
[2:34:17] Burnt their own children
[2:34:19] and offered them to some false empty
[2:34:23] god.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; I tell you, that's deception.
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; That's deception. But even then, God
[2:34:32] would not give up on Israel.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of a flaw you
[2:34:36] have. I don't care how much bondage
[2:34:38] you've gone into. I don't care what kind
[2:34:41] of sins you've committed. You are the
[2:34:43] people of God. And you will bring forth
[2:34:45] a masterpiece.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me?
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; God's not going to give up on you. You
[2:34:55] may give up on yourself. God will not
[2:34:57] give up on you.
[2:34:59] And even if you went and and went off by
[2:35:01] yourself, God, the Holy Spirit is going
[2:35:04] to keep he's going to keep penetrating
[2:35:06] your mind and your soul.
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; And he will bring back to remembrance
[2:35:11] the things that you've heard.
[2:35:15] [Applause]
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; He will not surrender up. He will not
[2:35:19] give up on that. Amen.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; He got so inspired
[2:35:27] that finally Apostle Paul said, "Thou
[2:35:31] Lord,
[2:35:32] in the beginning you laid the foundation
[2:35:35] of the earth
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; and the heavens are the work of thy
[2:35:39] hands and they shall perish.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; You'll crumple them up. You'll throw
[2:35:45] them in a waste basket.
[2:35:48] But thou remainest. You're the same. And
[2:35:52] they shall wax old as doth a garment.
[2:35:54] And as a vesture shalt thou fold them
[2:35:57] up, and they shall, and they shall be
[2:35:59] changed, but thou art the same, and your
[2:36:02] years fail not. And no wonder through
[2:36:05] the apostle John, he'll cry out in
[2:36:07] Revelations, "And he that sat on the
[2:36:10] throne said,
[2:36:11] &gt;&gt; "This is the one who shed the blood, he
[2:36:13] said,
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; behold." Attention people. Attention.
[2:36:18] Clover day Bible way. I make all things
[2:36:23] new.
[2:36:25] [Applause]
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; You're destined for a new body.
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; You're destined for a new home.
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; You're destined for a new city.
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; That's your destination.
[2:36:44] [Applause]
[2:36:49] And if you don't have any sense of going
[2:36:50] there, you may not rejoice over it. But
[2:36:52] I'll tell you, for people that have been
[2:36:53] looking for it and longing for it, and
[2:36:56] that's why God says, "You're my son.
[2:36:58] You're my daughter. You believe me.
[2:37:05] [Music]
[2:37:17] I've been 10 minutes. I will just be
[2:37:20] five.
[2:37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:21] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to quit wherever. Even I'm
[2:37:23] in the middle of a word. I'm going to
[2:37:24] quit.
[2:37:30] Do you know why God got so inspired?
[2:37:34] because he saw in that he saw in that
[2:37:37] life that was coming. God is his
[2:37:41] knowledge isn't merely immense. His
[2:37:43] knowledge is infinite.
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; He saw the church coming forth. He saw
[2:37:48] the martyrs suffering for him. He saw
[2:37:52] the reformation. He saw Luther and say,
[2:37:56] "I cannot recant.
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; I won't give up." Amen.
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; He saw him standing against that great
[2:38:03] harlot church
[2:38:05] &gt;&gt; and he saw the reformers and he saw the
[2:38:08] messenger.
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; Here comes one,
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; don't get me wrong, like him.
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; This vessel,
[2:38:20] he's like Moses
[2:38:23] &gt;&gt; has slow,
[2:38:25] cumbersome speech.
[2:38:27] He can't express himself.
[2:38:33] But he believes me.
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; He even write a letter to me
[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; and nailed it on a tree. He believes me.
[2:38:42] He believes I'm here. He believes I'm in
[2:38:45] the woods. He believes I'm alive.
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; He believes I'm resurrected. And God saw
[2:38:50] him coming out of that blood.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; And he was so inspired. Amen.
[2:38:57] &gt;&gt; I'll let him fulfill Luke 17:30.
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; I'll let the very life of my son issue
[2:39:04] out through him and I'll give him signs
[2:39:07] and I'll work wonders through him. I'll
[2:39:10] let him tell the people the secret of
[2:39:11] their heart like my son did.
[2:39:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:23] and he needs a flaw.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; I'll let his parents
[2:39:31] serve and worship
[2:39:33] the very harlot
[2:39:36] system
[2:39:37] &gt;&gt; that he is so going to fight against.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; I'll let them be overcome
[2:39:45] by alcohol.
[2:39:47] The very demon that will take his life
[2:40:00] some
[2:40:03] completely under the influence in a
[2:40:06] drunken stouper and drive a car and
[2:40:10] smash head on in and let him lose his
[2:40:13] life.
[2:40:15] His lips will be sealed. I will allow
[2:40:17] that.
[2:40:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:40:22] &gt;&gt; But he will never
[2:40:24] heir
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; in his vision.
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; He will be another one that will hold to
[2:40:31] his vision.
[2:40:33] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to this church, I have
[2:40:35] been looking back not over the last
[2:40:37] year, the last two years, over the last
[2:40:39] 30 years and and and all the things that
[2:40:42] may happen in your life. But I look back
[2:40:44] and I say, God, what was your vision?
[2:40:48] Your vision shall be my vision. What did
[2:40:51] you intend here? Why did you raise us up
[2:40:54] to get this message out? Then thus shall
[2:40:56] it be.
[2:41:01] &gt;&gt; This congregation of people will hear me
[2:41:04] preach according to the initial vision.
[2:41:06] You've been raised up to be witnesses of
[2:41:08] this end time message.
[2:41:11] God was so inspired at the thought that
[2:41:14] this vision that this vision would be
[2:41:16] fulfilled. That's one of the reasons he
[2:41:18] struck him.
[2:41:24] &gt;&gt; I haven't time but I must conclude with
[2:41:26] this.
[2:41:30] Now, here comes this messenger
[2:41:33] and he meets seven angels and he goes
[2:41:35] back to speak,
[2:41:39] Brother Randy, Sister Lori, and you from
[2:41:41] Arizona,
[2:41:44] Brother Wes,
[2:41:46] your wife and daughter Jessica,
[2:41:50] you from Arizona,
[2:41:54] others
[2:41:56] perhaps.
[2:41:58] Isn't it amazing? Of all the earth,
[2:42:02] God chose a spot out in that desert.
[2:42:05] &gt;&gt; And he was so inspired.
[2:42:08] And there are things that have been
[2:42:10] sealed up since the foundation of the
[2:42:12] world.
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; And his son is hanging on the cross. His
[2:42:15] son is a beaten mass of humanity. But he
[2:42:18] sees that there's going to be secrets
[2:42:20] that are going to be made known to a
[2:42:22] people. And it must be made known. This
[2:42:24] blood must speak. Speak.
[2:42:27] Hallelujah.
[2:42:31] &gt;&gt; And after the prophet of God had that
[2:42:33] visitation, he came back and he said, he
[2:42:35] spoke in the seals, the opening of the
[2:42:37] seals, he said, "I was so inspired."
[2:42:42] &gt;&gt; Sometimes hardly knowing what he's
[2:42:44] saying,
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; but he's so inspired
[2:42:48] because it had to reveal
[2:42:51] Jesus Christ now
[2:42:53] &gt;&gt; and had to tell the people.
[2:42:56] had to have a vessel. So inspired,
[2:43:00] &gt;&gt; I'll show him on the other side. I'll
[2:43:02] take him beyond the curtain of time.
[2:43:05] &gt;&gt; So inspired, I'll show this messenger
[2:43:08] the bodies these people are going to
[2:43:10] live in.
[2:43:15] &gt;&gt; That's why he said, I saw you all there.
[2:43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:23] &gt;&gt; You tell that devil. You tell that evil
[2:43:27] one coming by to whisper in your ear,
[2:43:30] "I've heard different things
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; than what you're telling me.
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; I've heard eternal things.
[2:43:37] &gt;&gt; You cannot You cannot impose this on me
[2:43:41] and you cannot impede my walk with God.
[2:43:46] &gt;&gt; I reject you
[2:43:49] &gt;&gt; and I reject your voice because I've
[2:43:51] heard another voice."
[2:43:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:56] Hallelujah.
[2:43:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, my friend.
[2:44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "If there was ever anything,
[2:44:07] if I've ever said anything that was
[2:44:10] inspired,
[2:44:12] it was in that
[2:44:14] &gt;&gt; immediately after the angels of the Lord
[2:44:16] appeared
[2:44:18] and about the seven seals." And I was to
[2:44:21] return back immediately after that. He
[2:44:24] said here to Jeffersonville and preach
[2:44:27] the seven seals. And
[2:44:30] I'm not just closing on a quiet quiet
[2:44:32] note. if I've ever said anything,
[2:44:40] he said
[2:44:42] to thousands of people,
[2:44:44] he said to the blind man in India,
[2:44:49] he told me about that
[2:44:54] and he said
[2:44:56] there was tens of thousands, hundreds of
[2:44:58] thousands of people and I've been in
[2:44:59] that church and stood behind the chair
[2:45:03] chair chair that or the table rather
[2:45:05] that he stood. He told me this man had
[2:45:07] been a sun worshipper
[2:45:09] and his eyes had been burned out by
[2:45:11] worshiping the sun.
[2:45:15] You think you have a physical problem?
[2:45:18] Think of this one.
[2:45:20] And his eyes had been burned out.
[2:45:23] And brother Brandham said as he stood
[2:45:26] there, he's in two worlds.
[2:45:30] and he looks and he sees the sideburns
[2:45:33] are black, real black.
[2:45:38] But in the vision, he sees it that
[2:45:40] there's a little gray hair. See how
[2:45:42] accurate it was? A little gray hair in
[2:45:44] it. So he said, "I knew he was going to
[2:45:47] receive his sight."
[2:45:49] But he says, "Then I needed to exercise
[2:45:52] my my faith that it would happen right
[2:45:54] then
[2:45:59] and called for his healing."
[2:46:02] Thus sayeth the Lord. And the place went
[2:46:05] into pandemonium. They were trying to
[2:46:08] pull pieces of his suit and his pants
[2:46:10] off so they have a piece of cloth. They
[2:46:13] had to have the the ushers and the
[2:46:16] people try to protect him. And that man
[2:46:19] went screaming, his eyes perfect. He
[2:46:21] said, he said he saw that he would he
[2:46:24] saw him and turn his head and look and
[2:46:26] he said, "I I saw that he had his
[2:46:28] sight." And now he he he speaks sight
[2:46:31] for that person.
[2:46:33] He what he's saying here is what he
[2:46:35] spoke to you and I under the opening of
[2:46:38] God's word is greater than giving that
[2:46:41] man his sight.
[2:46:44] &gt;&gt; Is greater than all the supernatural.
[2:46:48] friends.
[2:46:50] &gt;&gt; He went up on a mountain like Moses went
[2:46:52] up on a mountain, but he came down
[2:46:56] and he has a word
[2:46:58] &gt;&gt; that's been left us. That's why I am
[2:47:01] consumed. Don't think it's just myself
[2:47:03] personally. I'm consumed. If there's
[2:47:05] anything in me, I want to be getting
[2:47:07] this word to every last elected seed.
[2:47:11] I've told you many times and I say may
[2:47:13] it be a theme of this church what we
[2:47:16] want to be able to do when we meet him
[2:47:18] when we go and meet him our Lord Jesus
[2:47:21] when we meet the messenger cuz we'll be
[2:47:23] gathered to the people of our age when
[2:47:25] we meet him you want to be able to look
[2:47:27] in his face and say brother Brandham we
[2:47:31] did what we could
[2:47:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[2:47:33] &gt;&gt; we had a little fellow up maybe not much
[2:47:35] of a preacher not deep and all of these
[2:47:37] things but he told us he wanted to just
[2:47:40] do what he Good.
[2:47:41] &gt;&gt; And that's what we doing.
[2:47:44] &gt;&gt; God bless you people.
[2:47:45] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:47:51] [Applause]
[2:48:00] &gt;&gt; Your flaw is valuable.
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:04] &gt;&gt; The value of your of the flaw. May God
[2:48:07] ever make this
[2:48:12] in your forefront of your mind.
[2:48:15] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:48:19] I'd like to have you
[2:48:22] stand with me. And we'll sing my
[2:48:24] favorite,
[2:48:26] brother Ryan. It's You had the mind of
[2:48:29] God. I couldn't believe it.
[2:48:34] I just walked into the study and I heard
[2:48:37] you singing. I that sounds so familiar.
[2:48:39] I went and turned the volume up and you
[2:48:42] were singing blessed assurance and I
[2:48:44] just started to cry like a baby. I said,
[2:48:46] "Oh God, here I've got the woman's
[2:48:48] picture up here. I'm going to talk about
[2:48:51] her life and he's singing one of her
[2:48:53] most famous songs and one of my
[2:48:56] favorites of all time. I'll ask you to
[2:48:58] join with me and sing it as the
[2:49:00] redeemed."
[2:49:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:53:57] [Music]
[2:54:01] I'm going to ask you brother Timothy
[2:54:03] Anoco if you would come up please pray a
[2:54:06] prayer of blessing upon this church.
[2:54:10] Brother Timothy Anookco and his wife
[2:54:13] Sister Shantel,
[2:54:14] their children Paul and I believe
[2:54:17] Michelle Michael, I'm not too sure just
[2:54:19] how they pronounce it
[2:54:21] flew his family here second or third
[2:54:24] time I've been here
[2:54:27] and I'm just going to give you this.
[2:54:30] He didn't. He wanted to be sure that he
[2:54:33] was in the mind of God. So they flew
[2:54:36] over here without any announcement that
[2:54:38] they're coming.
[2:54:40] And he said, "If brother Biscll isn't
[2:54:42] there, then I know that my plan
[2:54:45] is not of God. He arrived. I was here.
[2:54:50] I'll phone his home. And if his wife
[2:54:52] indicates he's too busy, then I will I
[2:54:55] will understand. My plan is not to go
[2:54:57] ahead.
[2:54:58] [Music]
[2:55:00] And I and she said, "Well, my husband
[2:55:02] would like to see you." So we met here
[2:55:05] that and he held in his heart, "If
[2:55:07] brother Bis
[2:55:09] is too busy to have the kind of meeting
[2:55:11] I need to have, then I will take that."
[2:55:14] The third thing he had in his heart, I
[2:55:16] will take that as this is not the will
[2:55:18] of God. I said, "We have time." We were
[2:55:22] going to be with our brother Gerard and
[2:55:24] sister Angela, but I said we'll take
[2:55:26] Sunday afternoon and come and however
[2:55:28] time, 2 hours. Will that be fine? Yes,
[2:55:30] that'll be fine. We sat together. He
[2:55:33] tells me
[2:55:37] due to circumstances, I want to leave my
[2:55:39] wife and my family here
[2:55:43] to fellowship in this church and perhaps
[2:55:46] the children would go to the school.
[2:55:50] and he says,"I will need to find a
[2:55:52] place. I will need a three-bedroom home.
[2:55:54] I will need this." He began to make the
[2:55:56] requirements down. I just want to say to
[2:56:00] this church, "When you see Sister
[2:56:02] Shantel
[2:56:04] and her son Paul
[2:56:06] and daughter Michael Michelle,
[2:56:12] they came on vacation and left the
[2:56:14] family here.
[2:56:16] I would like the church to take it upon
[2:56:19] your heart to pray for them and say,
[2:56:21] "God, if there's anything I can do and
[2:56:24] but they were well able, they've already
[2:56:27] looked at several places and got
[2:56:29] something in mind and have looked at
[2:56:31] furniture. I can tell you they haven't
[2:56:33] wasted any time just here on a few days
[2:56:35] of vacation."
[2:56:37] And I I I feel humbled and I trust the
[2:56:41] congregation understand. I feel very
[2:56:43] humbled
[2:56:44] that a very qualified man he's an
[2:56:48] executive in a large company but feels
[2:56:51] something in his heart. I want my family
[2:56:54] in this particular South Africa's got
[2:56:57] wonderful churches and many wonderful
[2:57:00] pastors but his circumstances were such
[2:57:03] and now they're just entering into a
[2:57:05] burden
[2:57:07] and I pray brother Timothy God with you.
[2:57:10] He has to fly out about July the 2nd or
[2:57:14] thereabouts and has to go back to work
[2:57:16] and Sister Shantel and the family will
[2:57:18] be staying here. Invite her and make
[2:57:23] friends and let her know that this is a
[2:57:25] family and we do everything we can,
[2:57:28] Sister Shantel, support you and the
[2:57:30] children and be friendly with you and
[2:57:33] pray for you. And brother Timothy, God
[2:57:36] bless you. So this brother Timothy on a
[2:57:39] Tokco I believe some friends came from
[2:57:42] Edmonton. There's a family from
[2:57:43] Edmonton. Did you come from Edmonton?
[2:57:46] Some came from Edmonton down. All right
[2:57:49] there. God bless you. I just see some
[2:57:51] faces we didn't recognize right away.
[2:57:53] God bless you. I see this family here.
[2:57:56] God bless you. Lovely to have you. Come,
[2:57:59] brother Timothy. Would you please?
[2:58:01] This is my story.
[2:58:07] This is my song.
[2:58:12] Praising my
[2:58:17] father.
[2:58:22] This is my story.
[2:58:26] [Music]
[2:58:27] This is my song.
[2:58:32] Praising my s
[2:58:36] [Music]
[2:58:41] Lord Jesus,
[2:58:44] I believe that is the very very reason
[2:58:46] we are here
[2:58:50] to praise you Lord
[2:58:53] &gt;&gt; all the day long
[2:58:56] &gt;&gt; and what we have been hearing this
[2:58:59] morning Lord
[2:59:02] what kind of weakness we have. You saw
[2:59:06] it before,
[2:59:09] but you predestinated us to be your
[2:59:12] children
[2:59:13] to receive the message at the end of the
[2:59:16] time.
[2:59:17] No one has a plan before to accept the
[2:59:20] message. But we thank you for that.
[2:59:24] Thank you Lord for everything that has
[2:59:26] been spoken.
[2:59:28] Bless brother Ed. Bless the church.
[2:59:32] And God, you know what they are trying
[2:59:34] to do to encourage the bride of Jesus
[2:59:38] Christ across the world.
[2:59:41] Missionary,
[2:59:43] streaming
[2:59:45] and whatever I can imagine.
[2:59:49] Lord, we say thank you.
[2:59:53] Bless everyone that has come this
[2:59:55] morning.
[2:59:56] And as we are departing from this place,
[2:59:59] Lord, I pray that your spirit departed
[3:00:03] with us. And as we are coming this
[3:00:06] evening, bring us back and speak tonight
[3:00:09] and again through right at home
[3:00:12] and be with us for the rest of the life.
[3:00:16] We pray in Jesus Christ's name and for
[3:00:19] your glory. Amen.
[3:00:23] [Music]
[3:00:25] with you. Amen.
[3:00:32] &gt;&gt; We're going to dismiss you because we've
[3:00:33] been let along. I remember that the
[3:00:36] giving your giving is part of worship is
[3:00:38] that you've been in here worshiping and
[3:00:40] brother brother Toby he gave us a he
[3:00:42] gave us a little talk on on giving. I I
[3:00:45] thought that was wonderful. Thanks,
[3:00:46] brother Toby. I've heard many people
[3:00:48] refer to it and he said it's actually
[3:00:50] part of worship. So he said when you
[3:00:51] come in the door you're coming into
[3:00:53] worship. So, first give give your
[3:00:55] offering and then come into worship.
[3:00:56] We've always done it the other way.
[3:00:58] However you do it, I don't care. But we
[3:01:01] need you. We appreciate you. I do very,
[3:01:05] very much appreciate your strength, your
[3:01:07] attention, your attendance. And now
[3:01:10] remember the Lord in your giving. And
[3:01:12] God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus
[3:01:15] name. Amen. God bless you.
