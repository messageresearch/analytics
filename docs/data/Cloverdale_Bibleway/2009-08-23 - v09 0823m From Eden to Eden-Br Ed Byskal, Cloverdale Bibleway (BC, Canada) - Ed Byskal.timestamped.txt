[8:52] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[8:54] Lord. We have one prayer request and ask
[8:57] Brother Tom Ray to come and take the
[9:00] knees before the Lord. Open service in a
[9:02] word of prayer. Sister Snow has a urgent
[9:05] prayer request. We want to remember her
[9:07] sister Jennifer and her family that God
[9:09] would intervene and make himself known
[9:12] in their personal matter but also for
[9:15] their salvation. So we want to remember
[9:17] Sister Snow's sister Jennifer. Amen. If
[9:20] you have a need on your heart, just
[9:22] raise it as we go to prayer. Brother
[9:23] Tom,
[9:27] [Music]
[9:29] precious Lord,
[9:31] what a wonderful chorus and song we've
[9:33] just sung. I claim the blood,
[9:38] Lord. A blood that can cleanse,
[9:40] a blood that can deliver, a blood that
[9:43] can set free, a blood that can heal, a
[9:46] blood that saves, a blood that washes
[9:49] us. Lord, how thankful we are for the
[9:51] blood of Jesus Christ this morning. That
[9:54] is not something in our imagination, but
[9:56] we can say this morning, I've
[9:57] experienced the blood, Lord. I felt the
[10:00] power of that blood. It has redeemed me.
[10:03] It has changed me. It is molding me. It
[10:06] is shaping me. Oh, the blood shall never
[10:09] lose its power this morning. Lord, as
[10:12] the redeemed stand here washed in the
[10:14] blood of the lamb, surely there could be
[10:17] something within our lips that shouts
[10:19] out and proclaims precious blood. Lord,
[10:22] how thankful we are for the washing of
[10:25] the water, of the bleeding word this
[10:27] morning that has come through a mouth of
[10:30] a prophet, Lord, that is washing a
[10:32] bride, cleansing of people, Lord, doing
[10:35] an eternal work within the hearts and
[10:37] lives of your children. And as brother
[10:40] Jason has read this request, I believe
[10:42] there's many requests that are here this
[10:44] morning on the internet that have joined
[10:47] with us this morning. I have a need this
[10:49] morning. I can say by the assurance of
[10:51] your word, there is wonderful working
[10:54] power in the blood of the lamb. It's
[10:57] still in effect, Lord. And we're looking
[10:59] to you to touch lives this morning as
[11:02] the pastor will come and minister words,
[11:05] not words of man, but words of life. We
[11:08] pray that you'll anoint him mightily,
[11:10] that you'll anoint our ears to hear,
[11:12] eyes to see the glory of your word as it
[11:16] passes by our way. Lord, meet every need
[11:18] in divine presence. And may God, you
[11:21] minister from the to the youngest and to
[11:24] the oldest of us as we lift up our
[11:26] hearts in adoration and praise of the
[11:29] goodness of God. Bless your children
[11:31] now. Breathe upon us. Let the Holy Ghost
[11:34] fall. Let lives be changed, Lord. Let
[11:38] those that are bound be set free by the
[11:41] word of God. Let there be liberty in the
[11:43] camp of God. For where the spirit of the
[11:45] Lord is, there is liberty. And the
[11:48] children of the Lord have a right to
[11:49] shout and sing. Bless your children now,
[11:52] Lord.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; In Jesus name we pray.
[11:56] Amen.
[11:57] Amen.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's
[12:03] &gt;&gt; wonderful to be found in the house of
[12:05] God, isn't it?
[12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats.
[12:09] Just a couple of announcements.
[12:14] Is Brother Elvie here? We've been

[12:24] Brother Elvie, God bless you. All the
[12:27] way from China. We've been waiting for
[12:29] you, Brother Alvie. God bless you.
[12:32] Amen. Brother Elvie, Lord willing, will
[12:35] be ministering on Wednesday
[12:37] &gt;&gt; with Brother Murphy.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; I don't know if that came as a surprise
[12:41] or not, Brother Alvie, but we're looking
[12:43] forward to a wonderful time in hearing
[12:45] what God is doing over in China. God
[12:47] bless you. Also, we've invited Brother
[12:50] Caillumi to speak next Sunday. He's out

[29:49] Praise him.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Isn't it great? Isn't our God great?
[29:56] Oh,
[29:58] &gt;&gt; I tell you what,
[30:00] &gt;&gt; it's just marvelous to think that he
[30:02] could look upon us. Sometimes I and I've
[30:07] said here before, I marvel that he ever
[30:09] found us little specks. Uh what size can
[30:14] we be when even the world itself we sit
[30:17] on that we dwell on is just a a grain of
[30:21] sand or dust in space. And this great
[30:24] God that fills all time and space, as
[30:26] the prophet said, they'd be too
[30:28] mysterious to us. But he came down, made
[30:31] himself known.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; Wonderful Lord Jesus. Amen.
[30:38] While you're still standing, we're just
[30:40] going to
[30:42] uh I'd like to just mention that we
[30:44] received a letter from
[30:46] brother Louis's father who was here and
[30:51] he said at the the last of his letter, a
[30:54] very lovely letter, let all the brethren
[30:57] of the church
[30:59] uh he wanted me to express his gratitude
[31:03] for their wonderful time that they
[31:05] dedicated to
[31:07] And with all my gratitude, I send them
[31:10] all my affections.
[31:13] I only want to ask, brother Biscll, that
[31:15] you pray for me so I would be able to be
[31:19] a Christian worthy to consider myself a
[31:23] son of God.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; And I thought that was a wonderful last
[31:26] statement.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; To a letter. May God uh bless our
[31:30] brother and and fulfill that desire,
[31:33] that request.
[31:36] Uh this last week
[31:38] uh I was saddened to hear brother Roger
[31:42] through you that uh John Vertasic who
[31:47] was not a attending here at the church
[31:51] and not a believer uh of the message
[31:53] that we have but he was such a good man
[31:57] and such a uh considerate uh he was one
[32:02] that was calm. He was one that was free
[32:04] with his time and all these baffles that
[32:07] you see here across the building. That
[32:10] was John Vertasic's work and he had a
[32:14] has a website
[32:16] uh and uh he has worked for a lot of
[32:19] very notable people in the music
[32:21] industry and has worked along with our
[32:24] brother Roger Monk for many years. He
[32:27] passed away this uh last week and uh he
[32:31] was just 61 years old. And I just think
[32:34] that it would be uh only correct that we
[32:38] return our thanks to him by praying for
[32:42] his family and praying for you also,
[32:45] Brother Roger. I know you're very very
[32:47] close to uh John and uh we we we knew
[32:51] him for many years and he helped us out
[32:53] many many times. He was a absolute
[32:56] expert, one of the finest in the
[32:59] industry. And so to think that he would
[33:01] take time, he came came here to the
[33:04] church and helped us work through
[33:05] problems and and uh if you enjoy the
[33:09] sound
[33:10] and say, "I really enjoy hearing the
[33:13] service. The sound is excellent." Well,
[33:16] then we have thanks to uh John Bertasic.
[33:20] And so God uh be with his family and I
[33:24] wonder brother Roger if you'd convey
[33:26] that for us. We're going to remember
[33:28] them in prayer in in just a in just a
[33:30] moment as well. So I want to thank each
[33:33] of you for coming for your prayers for
[33:37] those of you that are visiting.
[33:39] God bless you. And uh let us pray that
[33:42] God's will will be done
[33:45] uh in the service this morning. I don't
[33:47] think we've gathered in vain, have we?
[33:49] &gt;&gt; No.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; We've gathered with a purpose.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Have you gathered with an expectation?
[33:55] I have. And I thank all of you and the
[33:58] ministry and and uh
[34:02] we're just in great expectation.
[34:05] Mostly thankful for the presence of the
[34:07] Holy Spirit with us. Amen.
[34:11] Let's just bow once more before we go to
[34:14] the scripture.
[34:17] Father God, our father,
[34:22] we are so grateful today that we can
[34:25] address you, that we can speak to you
[34:27] this way, that we can approach you, and
[34:30] you have given us the name of the Lord
[34:32] Jesus Christ, the name that's lifted up
[34:36] above every name, the son of man, the
[34:39] redeemer of the world, the sacrifice of
[34:43] God, God's lamb, our advocate
[34:46] All that we can uh we could express
[34:49] today is just so feeble in trying to
[34:53] speak and trying to verbalize what's in
[34:55] our hearts. But today we give you
[34:58] praise. You are indeed the almighty. You
[35:02] are indeed the redeemer. You have
[35:05] purchased us and we are not our own any
[35:07] longer. We pray, oh God, that you will
[35:11] uh be uh present to not only feed the
[35:14] sheep, but we have needs amongst us.
[35:17] Lord, I know of some myself that are in
[35:21] great need physically. They have not
[35:23] made their requests known, but they've
[35:25] made them known to you, made them known
[35:28] to myself and perhaps some others. I
[35:31] pray that you'll come down, oh God, and
[35:34] that you'll send virtue into their
[35:36] bodies. Send virtue into their souls,
[35:39] Lord, and into their spirits. For you
[35:42] have paid the price. And when you said,
[35:45] "It is finished." That indeed was true.
[35:49] So true. And we accept that. And then as
[35:52] you came and manifested yourself in this
[35:55] generation, Lord, how thankful I am for
[35:58] your prophet's voice and for the true to
[36:02] being true to the message and delivering
[36:05] us a word, oh God. And that word is
[36:08] Christ living in our time. Lord, I pray
[36:11] that you'll minister to each one, those
[36:14] that are streaming in whatever part of
[36:16] the world or this globe that they are
[36:18] in. I pray that you'll reach out into
[36:20] the room. Reach out into the building
[36:23] where they are and minister to them in a
[36:26] very special way. I pray. And now,
[36:28] Father, anoint us with your own spirit.
[36:34] How I think of the words of that
[36:35] inspired song, consecrate me now to thy
[36:39] service now, Lord. Oh, how we wait upon
[36:43] you, Lord. Draw me nearer, nearer,
[36:46] nearer to thy precious side. I want to
[36:49] remember John Vertasic's
[36:52] family today, Lord. And I pray that you
[36:55] will strengthen, oh God, and comfort
[36:57] them. We do not know, but their their
[37:00] soul. We do not know anything of them.
[37:03] We have not met them. But we thank you,
[37:06] Lord Jesus, for the time that John
[37:09] Vertasic spent here and the contribution
[37:12] he made and how willing he was to work
[37:15] and how freely he was able to work for
[37:18] us. I pray that you'll bless his family
[37:21] now. Uh Lord Jesus, I believe that's our
[37:24] responsibility to pray for all men, oh
[37:27] God. Pray that you'll give Brother Roger
[37:29] words of wisdom, Lord, words of comfort.
[37:32] he may convey the feeling that we have
[37:35] for him in Jesus Christ's name. Now I
[37:38] ask that you will take each one and
[37:40] anoint oh God my lips father might speak
[37:43] what you have on your heart to say to
[37:46] your children and all that may be
[37:49] visiting today for we know that there no
[37:51] there are no accidents with you
[37:54] everything is ordained and we believe
[37:56] that with all of our heart in the name
[37:59] of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you'd like to take your Bibles,
[38:05] I'll invite you to turn to Genesis the 3
[38:08] chapter
[38:11] and would appreciate your full and kind
[38:15] attention. We have uh some distance to
[38:20] go, but I I won't delay. I'll try to
[38:23] move as quickly as possible. I would
[38:24] like to have had some uh some slides and
[38:28] PowerPoint for you today, but it just
[38:30] didn't have sufficient time to do it.
[38:33] So, I trust God will give you the uh
[38:37] alert mind to uh follow and retain as we
[38:42] speak.
[38:43] And Genesis 3 uh starting with the first
[38:46] verse down through six.
[38:50] Now the serpent was more subtle than any
[38:52] beast of the field which the Lord God
[38:54] hath made. And he said unto the woman,
[38:58] "Ya hath God said, Ye shall not eat of
[39:00] every tree of the garden." And the woman
[39:03] said unto the serpent, "We may eat of
[39:06] the fruit of the trees of the garden,
[39:08] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[39:10] the midst of the garden, God hath said,
[39:12] you shall not eat of it, neither shall
[39:15] you touch it, lest you die." And the
[39:18] serpent said unto the woman, "Ye shall
[39:21] not surely die. For God doth know that
[39:24] in the day that you eat thereof, then
[39:27] your eyes shall be opened, and you shall
[39:30] be as God's, knowing good and evil." And
[39:33] when the woman saw that the tree was
[39:36] good for food, and that it was pleasant
[39:38] to the eyes, and a tree to be desired,
[39:41] to make one wise, she took of the fruit
[39:44] thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto
[39:47] her husband with her, and he did eat. I
[39:51] would like to have a second reading in
[39:53] Revelation
[39:55] the 12th chapter
[39:57] and we'll just start with verse 7 and
[40:01] read the three verses down through verse
[40:04] 9.
[40:06] So we've read in the first book of the
[40:09] Bible and now we're in the last book of
[40:11] the Bible. the two books that Satan
[40:13] hates the most
[40:16] &gt;&gt; because one tells of all his treachery
[40:19] in the beginning and one tells of his
[40:22] penalty at the end.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to be standing on the
[40:25] sidelines shouting glory.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; I want to see him go down.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Doesn't look like I have too many here
[40:32] that are joining me. Are you all joining
[40:34] me?
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; All right. Let let the believer stand on
[40:38] the sidelines and shout hallelujah.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. when he goes down.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; You think that I'll shed a tear when I
[40:47] see cancer go down?
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Not for a moment.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Just let this pale horse rider ride on
[40:55] his trip
[40:57] &gt;&gt; right into the flames.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And all who love him.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Might as well declare themselves.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; All right. Sorry for getting started
[41:10] here. And there was war in heaven. Verse
[41:14] seven, Michael and his angels fought
[41:17] against the dragon. And the dragon
[41:19] fought in his angels and prevailed not.
[41:23] Neither was her place found anymore in
[41:26] heaven. And the great dragon was cast
[41:30] out. That old serpent called the devil
[41:34] and Satan which deceiveth the whole
[41:37] world. He was cast out into the earth
[41:41] and his angels were cast out with him.
[41:45] Amen. God bless you as you have your
[41:46] saints.
[41:55] Now, if you'll stay focused, please.
[41:59] Whatever Satan introduced in Eden
[42:03] has been personified and magnified
[42:07] in Satan's Eden in this Eden. And so I
[42:12] wish to speak to you on the subject from
[42:15] Eden to Eden.
[42:19] his approach,
[42:21] his tactics,
[42:24] his device,
[42:26] uh his purpose,
[42:29] his method.
[42:31] All that he used in Eden
[42:34] has only been magnified
[42:37] perhaps millions of times. And science
[42:41] has provided him to be able to approach
[42:45] the human
[42:49] humanity
[42:50] with such subtility and such cunning
[42:54] that we could say today outside of the
[42:57] grace of God it be impossible to escape.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Absolutely impossible to escape. That's
[43:04] right.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; We also have in Genesis God's promise of
[43:08] the ultimate redemption
[43:12] when God spoke to the serpent himself
[43:16] and said that the woman's seed
[43:19] shall bruise the serpent's head.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Said you'll bruise his heel, but he will
[43:25] bruise your head.
[43:28] Brother Brandham speaks of the book of
[43:30] Revelation and he says this. This is the
[43:34] most official book
[43:36] of any book in the Bible.
[43:39] This is the only book that Christ put
[43:42] his own seal upon. It starts off with a
[43:46] blessing and ends with a curse. Blessed
[43:49] is he that readeth and cursed is he that
[43:52] takes anything out of it. It's the only
[43:55] book that Christ wrote himself of the
[43:58] whole Bible. The Ten Commandments he
[44:00] wrote with his fingers. That's right.
[44:04] The Jews held on to that. And today it's
[44:07] the Revelation.
[44:10] And if Satan hates any book in the
[44:12] Bible, it's the Revelation.
[44:14] There are two he hates of all scripture.
[44:18] He hates all scripture. And it's Genesis
[44:21] tells the beginning and revelation
[44:24] reveals what's going to happen to him in
[44:26] the last days. He's going to be bound a
[44:30] thousand years.
[44:32] Then him and the false prophet and the
[44:34] beast is going to be thrown alive into
[44:37] the lake of fire.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; And he'll attack the book of Genesis
[44:42] upon it being authentic. And he'll say
[44:46] it's not authentic. and he'll stir the
[44:49] minds of people. Watch where the devil
[44:52] lays that book of Genesis or the book of
[44:55] Revelation, the first and the last. The
[44:59] reason of course he already gives it
[45:02] because one is speaking of how he made
[45:06] his approach.
[45:08] Uh, I've said I've said this in just a
[45:12] very very brief sequence and you've
[45:14] heard it perhaps many times, but I'll
[45:16] say it for those that may not and for
[45:18] those that are new and young and haven't
[45:21] heard it before. Satan was cast out into
[45:24] the earth.
[45:28] Why did he go to Eden?
[45:30] Why didn't he go to some other continent
[45:32] or some other place? Why didn't he just
[45:35] remain in the wilderness?
[45:37] Why did he go to Eden?
[45:40] Because he wanted to get to Eve.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Now, he said in I, it's spoken in Isaiah
[45:47] by the prophet, I will ascend to the
[45:50] throne of God. I will ascend to the
[45:53] mount of the congregation, to the sides
[45:56] of the north. That entire scripture fits
[46:02] the doctrine of the serpent seed
[46:04] precisely because he will ascend. He
[46:06] will ascend to a mount. He will actually
[46:09] ascend to the congregation which refers
[46:12] to an appointed time, an appointed
[46:15] season. You see, uh when God took Eve
[46:21] from Adam, that was the first time that
[46:25] an appointed season came because prior
[46:28] to that, there was no place for Adam's
[46:31] seed. Right?
[46:33] &gt;&gt; That was the first time in all of
[46:36] creation that there was something a
[46:38] there was a a creature, a vessel that
[46:43] was so designed by God himself. And God,
[46:46] a father, God, one who has seed had come
[46:50] to the earth. And that's why there's
[46:52] nothing that man has ever discovered
[46:55] that resembles the earth because the
[46:57] prophet calls it a womb for God's seeds.
[47:00] And then God filled the earth with
[47:03] creation and multitudes of species which
[47:06] are already vanishing off the face of
[47:09] the earth into extinction. But God the
[47:12] creator had created a vast array of
[47:15] life. Let the earth bring forth. Let the
[47:17] waters bring forth. And it all brought
[47:19] forth. It was life. Life. All varieties
[47:23] of life. All colors. All types of all
[47:26] types of creation because God is a
[47:28] creator.
[47:30] And no doubt you have looked at the
[47:32] aquariums or different places and
[47:34] different species of life and looked at
[47:37] and said who who who what kind of mind
[47:39] could create this?
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Only God.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; And he created all of these things
[47:46] because he's a creator. And the prophet
[47:48] has said Satan is not a creator. He can
[47:52] only pervert what God has created. So
[47:55] hold that in your mind.
[47:58] So God has created all this uh in
[48:01] incredible uh species of of creation
[48:06] and Satan he cannot create these things.
[48:09] He can only pervert them.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; And Satan came to that Eden, God's Eden,
[48:20] and there he began to speak. I want you
[48:24] to watch very very closely.
[48:26] In that Eden,
[48:30] Satan through the instrumentality of the
[48:33] serpent
[48:34] began to speak.
[48:37] He began to speak not to Adam but to
[48:40] Eve.
[48:41] Why did he want to come to Eve?
[48:44] Because he wanted to get into humanity.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Why did he want to get into humanity?
[48:50] Because he wanted to get into Israel.
[48:53] Why did he want to get into Israel?
[48:55] Because he wanted to get into the
[48:56] church.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Why did he want to get into the church?
[49:00] Because he wanted to get into the bride
[49:02] of Jesus Christ that would be called out
[49:03] from the church. But why would he desire
[49:06] to get into the bride? Because she was
[49:08] destined for the throne. And there he
[49:12] said in through the prophet Isaiah, God
[49:15] speaking and revealing the secret of
[49:18] Satan's heart, Lucifer's heart, I will
[49:20] ascend to the throne of God.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; That's what was in his heart. And
[49:24] iniquity was found in his heart. And he
[49:27] was cast out to the earth. And that's
[49:29] why he that's why he ended up in Eden.
[49:32] And he didn't appear. He didn't appear.
[49:34] And he used the instrumentality of a
[49:36] serpent, not a snake, an upright being
[49:38] who could talk intelligently to God. who
[49:40] could talk to the woman, who could
[49:42] reason, who had all perhaps the closest
[49:45] thing there was to Adam, the missing
[49:47] link, if you would.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; And he's the one. And God spoke more to
[49:53] him than he did to Adam.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; And told him, I'll put enmity between
[50:01] thy seed
[50:04] &gt;&gt; and the seed of the woman. A woman
[50:06] doesn't have seed. The only woman that
[50:08] ever received seed aside from a man was
[50:13] Mary,
[50:15] &gt;&gt; a virgin.
[50:17] And she received seed, the creation, the
[50:20] second creation, the second Adam. And
[50:23] the prophecies that spoke of this one
[50:26] coming, the Messiah. Those prophecies,
[50:29] the prophet said, lodged in the womb of
[50:32] Mary. And that's how Jesus Christ came
[50:35] on the scene. He was the second Adam
[50:38] spoken by the word of God.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; And came into the earth as a kinsman
[50:44] redeemer. And without that, we're all
[50:46] lost.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; You're lost. I'm lost. Without that, the
[50:50] world lies in its darkness and sin and
[50:52] confusion.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Yeah.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; He said in questions and answers, "Satan
[51:06] was literally cast out of heaven by
[51:08] Michael,
[51:09] the archangel of God, and he was cast to
[51:13] the earth, came to the earth, got into
[51:16] the serpent, deceived Eve, and then has
[51:20] got into men, women, all down through
[51:22] the age on the same thing he started at
[51:25] the beginning a great big kingdom,
[51:28] prettier than the other fellows, uh to
[51:31] be a governor over all to know it all.
[51:34] That is why he he so brazen, so so
[51:38] crass, he would come to Jesus Christ
[51:40] himself and say, "If thou be the son of
[51:43] God,
[51:46] make these stones bread." Jesus answered
[51:49] him with the word. Brother Brandham
[51:51] said, "Of all the marvelous and glorious
[51:54] gifts what Christ was endowed with, he
[51:57] only answered Satan with the word." And
[51:59] because you have access to that word,
[52:02] you have access to the same authority.
[52:05] We don't have power, but you do have the
[52:07] authority.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; You have the same authority that Jesus
[52:11] Christ used. It is written.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; It is written.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; It is written.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; And every time it defeated him.
[52:19] Amen.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; In the greatest battle ever fought said,
[52:24] "This great battle that was ever fought,
[52:27] the great first battle that was ever
[52:30] fought began in heaven when Michael and
[52:33] his angels fought against Lucifer and
[52:36] his angels.
[52:38] The first battle was in heaven. So sin
[52:40] did not originate on earth. It
[52:42] originated in heaven. That might jar
[52:46] some minds
[52:48] because sin is not just a whole lot of
[52:50] immoral living. Sin is unbelief.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; And Lucifer
[52:58] committed that sin and that's what
[53:01] brother Brandon refers to. And then it
[53:02] was thrown down from heaven, cast out of
[53:05] heaven to the earth and fell on human
[53:08] beings. You're well familiar with this
[53:11] quote, but listen closely. Then the
[53:14] battle from angels became human battles.
[53:16] It's your battle.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; The battle that angels fought one day is
[53:22] your battle.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; And Satan came to destroy God's
[53:27] creation.
[53:29] What God had created for himself. Satan
[53:33] had come to destroy this. That's what
[53:35] his purpose was was to destroy it. When
[53:39] Satan came and approached Eve,
[53:42] his purpose was to destroy creation.
[53:46] And the destructive thing in our world
[53:50] today all began there.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Every grave,
[53:56] &gt;&gt; every hospital bed, every prison cell,
[53:59] every insane institution, and every
[54:02] insane person walking on our streets.
[54:05] And there's many. Right.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; There's many. I'm saying
[54:10] &gt;&gt; you see it every day.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; You look at it and you say, "How can
[54:14] that person be in their right mind?"
[54:16] They aren't.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; I'm not judging them.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; They judge themselves.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Now, friends, don't be people of the
[54:28] 21st century. Be people of the word.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If you be with a modern mind
[54:36] of the 21st century, you're you won't be
[54:39] in the same bracket that I'm speaking to
[54:41] today.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; So then the battle began here on earth
[54:50] and began in us and it's been raging
[54:53] ever since.
[54:57] He said another place I'll probably read
[54:59] it. We're not here in a picnic. He says,
[55:02] "We're not here to eat cookies.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; We're here to fight a warfare
[55:08] &gt;&gt; and we're in the middle of a warfare."
[55:10] And if you find yourself in the middle
[55:11] of a conflict, a battle, and I said it's
[55:15] in your mind, it's that's the first
[55:17] battleground was chosen there. Said the
[55:20] first thing in heaven was a battle and
[55:22] Lucifer was kicked out and came to the
[55:25] earth. Then he polluted Eden. I'm
[55:27] reading some of these. They sound
[55:29] similar but they are there are different
[55:31] wording which I want you to get. He
[55:33] polluted Eden.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Then he's been polluting ever since.
[55:39] I just thought of how this world today
[55:42] in this generation is fighting
[55:44] pollution.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, you can't build too near that little
[55:49] trickle of water because there might be
[55:52] a salmon someday that wants to I'm not
[55:54] making fun of it. I'm just saying how
[55:56] extreme it's gone.
[56:00] a friend of mine who's actually given an
[56:03] offering to this church. He's never been
[56:05] a member of this church, never come, but
[56:07] a friend of mine who owns a lot of
[56:09] property and he was planting trees and
[56:11] he planted I think like about 50,000
[56:14] trees on this property and the and the
[56:17] and and the parks department came after
[56:19] him. The fisheries department of
[56:21] fisheries
[56:23] because there's a little stream and
[56:25] said, "You planted these trees too close
[56:26] to the stream. I don't want to even get
[56:29] time." and took him to court
[56:33] and held up a little minnow fish that
[56:36] was dead as evidence.
[56:40] And he said, "I don't know of any fish
[56:42] in there." But he said, "If there is,"
[56:44] he says, "you're the one that killed it
[56:46] to bring in here as evidence." And they
[56:48] had to admit that they killed it to
[56:50] bring it in as evidence. the only fish
[56:52] that they found a little minnow. They
[56:54] killed the fish to bring in as evidence
[56:56] that it a man has actually beautified
[56:59] hundreds of acres of land and then they
[57:02] brought them in. Well, you know, I
[57:04] understand that we don't want to pollute
[57:06] the water. I understand. But you can
[57:09] kind of go too far, can't you?
[57:12] &gt;&gt; I understand that we want to recycle
[57:14] everything.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; I guess I'm maybe the only one who
[57:19] recycles here. I don't know.
[57:21] At least I try.
[57:25] Fighting wars, fighting pollution,
[57:27] fighting wars, fighting drugs, fighting
[57:31] depression, fighting inflation, fighting
[57:34] poverty, fighting pollution again,
[57:37] fighting non-believers, fighting
[57:39] technology, fighting for the common
[57:41] good, fighting churches, religion,
[57:44] everybody's fighting at war. You talk
[57:46] about being at war, isn't that right?
[57:49] That's the world we live in.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; We'll never clean it up or we're going
[57:53] to clean it up. We're not going to clean
[57:55] it up. It's going to be a holy fire
[57:58] &gt;&gt; come from God.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Going to clean the air, the sea, the
[58:03] land, and the whole earth and make it
[58:06] fit for God and his children.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; And by his grace, I I desire and and
[58:14] plan to be there.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; By his grace, you plan to be there. Do
[58:18] you not?
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:26] He said, "And every from the battle in
[58:29] heaven, it's come to the battle of earth
[58:31] and it's to be finished on earth at the
[58:34] end time in a battle called Armageddon."
[58:38] Started in heaven. Angels was kicked
[58:40] out. He says, "And when they did, they
[58:42] dropped right down to Eden. And here
[58:45] started the battle down on earth. So we
[58:48] read in our first scripture.
[58:52] Soon as I say first world war, you'll
[58:55] think of 1919 or someplace in there. No,
[59:00] I read about the first world war this
[59:02] morning.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; When Satan came to Eve,
[59:07] &gt;&gt; that was the first world war.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Truly world war. The first war was not
[59:13] fought in Europe.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; The first world war was fought in Eden.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; The first war was fought in heaven.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; But the first world war was fought in
[59:26] Eden.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; And he didn't prevail in heaven.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; And I will tell you to my dying day, he
[59:36] will not prevail on earth. Amen. Amen.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; He's fighting. He's using every device,
[59:44] every possible tactic, every lie, every
[59:47] doubt, every disease, every sickness,
[59:50] every hatred, everything. We don't have
[59:52] time to name it, but I will say in
[59:54] simplicity, he shall not prevail.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; And that ought to make every son and
[1:00:00] daughter of God stand up and shout,
[1:00:03] hallelujah. He shall not prevail.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it wonderful?
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; He shall not prevail. That's right.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; I think it would be good for you to say
[1:00:14] that. He shall not prevail.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; You've been sick, but he shall not
[1:00:19] prevail.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; We've been tormented and all kinds of
[1:00:25] things have come your way and financial
[1:00:28] distresses, but he shall not prevail.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; He cannot use that to defeat you.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; I feel like shouting hallelujah
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; to our God.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Someone
[1:00:52] from the College of the Atlantic,
[1:00:54] a professor or a
[1:00:57] educator,
[1:00:59] notable person.
[1:01:02] He said, "Since I've started paying
[1:01:04] attention to environmentalism in the
[1:01:06] United States,
[1:01:07] I felt that the movement has been
[1:01:09] fighting a losing battle.
[1:01:12] Environmental laws are rolling
[1:01:14] backwards.
[1:01:16] Pollution is increasing
[1:01:18] and the public seems less and less
[1:01:21] aware.
[1:01:26] Man
[1:01:27] is not in his own ability going to
[1:01:30] conquer.
[1:01:32] this battle.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; I haven't lived that long, but I lived
[1:01:40] long enough to tell you people that when
[1:01:43] I was a young man working,
[1:01:46] I got paid
[1:01:48] very little money. But it was good
[1:01:50] money. The coins were silver.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Pure silver.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; You don't have a silver coin in your
[1:01:57] pocket.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:02:01] And we paid cash. I didn't have any
[1:02:03] credit cards. I got a bunch of credit
[1:02:05] cards now. Got reward cards and more
[1:02:08] cards and
[1:02:10] travel cards and air mile cards and all
[1:02:13] kinds of cards.
[1:02:16] Do we live better? When I went to the
[1:02:19] store and bought a strawberry, do you
[1:02:20] know what? It tasted like a strawberry.
[1:02:24] not sawdust
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; or some tasteless pulp.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; When I had a peach, it wasn't all rotten
[1:02:33] in the middle.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; I didn't have bananas and oranges that
[1:02:38] had to be gassed to be ripened.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; They didn't look as nice, but they
[1:02:43] tasted a whole lot better.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Isn't it strange? all this technology
[1:02:49] and all this, you know, the civilization
[1:02:52] that we've cultivated. Isn't it
[1:02:54] incredible? And we live poor and we eat
[1:02:57] poor.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; I didn't even dream of going to a
[1:03:03] hospital and waiting.
[1:03:05] Never entered my mind that you'd have to
[1:03:08] wait. Line up. We didn't know anything
[1:03:10] about lineups.
[1:03:12] They just walked into the hospital and
[1:03:15] went to the emergency or went wherever.
[1:03:18] who we didn't have a Isn't it amazing
[1:03:20] that we have developed all this society
[1:03:23] and all this great intelligence and now
[1:03:26] you wait maybe you'll die before you get
[1:03:28] in.
[1:03:32] I have serious doubts about some of our
[1:03:34] people. Yeah, I only made just a few
[1:03:38] dollars a day, but my goodness, the
[1:03:40] economics were great. I paid a dollar a
[1:03:43] day for my children to be born.
[1:03:48] No, it wasn't in the dark ages.
[1:03:52] It actually was in modern times.
[1:03:55] My kids cost me 15 bucks.
[1:04:02] Go ahead. It's all right. That's what it
[1:04:05] cost.
[1:04:07] So, are we better off?
[1:04:10] You young people, don't look at me
[1:04:12] sideways now when you think, "Oh, he's
[1:04:15] from way back there." I'm from the good
[1:04:17] old days.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Emphasis on the good.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:04:28] Adam and Eve lost their first war.
[1:04:35] But we didn't lose the war. Adam and Eve
[1:04:38] lost the first war. Says Satan, he said
[1:04:42] in conflict between God and Satan. Satan
[1:04:45] in this time set up uh the same system
[1:04:48] that he did in the garden of Eden,
[1:04:50] reasoning against the word of God. And
[1:04:52] in the breach, he said when Adam sinned
[1:04:54] by heeding his wife's reasoning instead
[1:04:57] of holding to God's word, that's what
[1:05:00] made Adam sin, his wife reasoned with
[1:05:03] Satan and then produced the product to
[1:05:06] Adam. And Adam turned loose the word and
[1:05:09] sold out. And he lost also his
[1:05:11] inheritance when he lost his fellowship
[1:05:14] and right to life. And this produced
[1:05:17] Cain and Abel. There were and then and
[1:05:21] then came after that Seth. But Cain and
[1:05:25] Abel
[1:05:27] twins.
[1:05:33] Now here's something shocking. He said
[1:05:35] by by physical death in the uniting of
[1:05:39] of mother Eve and Satan together by
[1:05:43] disbelieving God's word they united and
[1:05:46] brought in the product of death. Death
[1:05:49] is a product of uniting Satan and Eve
[1:05:52] together.
[1:05:54] In the day you eat thereof, in the day
[1:05:57] you partake thereof, in that day you'll
[1:06:00] die. and the uniting of the two. It
[1:06:04] wasn't an apple or an apricot or
[1:06:06] anything else. It was a sexual act. And
[1:06:09] and and Cain was the product. I even
[1:06:11] asked Rabbi Richmond. I said I said,
[1:06:15] "Cain, how can you ever attribute Cain
[1:06:21] who lied to God, was a liar,
[1:06:25] lied in the face of God, murdered his
[1:06:28] brother?" How do you attribute those
[1:06:31] attributes to having come from Adam who
[1:06:34] was a son of God? And of course, he was
[1:06:37] quite in agreement that it couldn't
[1:06:39] possibly have come from God.
[1:06:42] It didn't.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says in the New
[1:06:45] Testament, not as of Cain who was of
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; the wicked one.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Never says that of Abel, but of Cain was
[1:06:54] of he was a product of. I'm just
[1:06:57] establishing that it's elementary
[1:06:59] perhaps to quite a few of you. But then
[1:07:02] in a in a revelation series once again
[1:07:05] and and please don't tire of my reading
[1:07:08] because I have uh considerable but stay
[1:07:10] with me. Our kinsman is handed a seven
[1:07:14] seal book of redemption from the
[1:07:16] original owner. When we lost it in the
[1:07:19] garden of Eden, we lost the book of
[1:07:21] redemption through Adam. It went back to
[1:07:25] the original owner. But there's been a
[1:07:27] poacher on the land, a squatter. That's
[1:07:31] Satan.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; He's a squatter.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; He's a poacher.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; He's come over. He's a poacher. The
[1:07:39] earth doesn't belong to him. It belongs
[1:07:43] to God. But he's a poacher, a squatter.
[1:07:46] And it the title deed of our redemption.
[1:07:49] This seven sealed book. It's it is the
[1:07:52] title deed. and he breaks the seals and
[1:07:55] reveals gives us his inheritance to his
[1:07:59] people. He gives the inheritance that he
[1:08:02] inherited by becoming the kinsman
[1:08:04] redeemer. Oh, I just want you to stay
[1:08:06] with me. So, so very very close. And
[1:08:10] freely gives it out to us. It all
[1:08:13] belonged to him. He was the one who
[1:08:16] redeemed. But instead of keeping it to
[1:08:18] himself, he gives it back to the people.
[1:08:21] And that's his love for us.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; So Satan become a squatter.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; He become a poacher. It doesn't belong
[1:08:30] to him.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; The prophet said many places he
[1:08:33] possesses it. He's possessing the earth,
[1:08:36] but he doesn't own the earth. And he
[1:08:38] makes it very specific. I want you to
[1:08:40] understand that he possesses it. He's
[1:08:43] filled the earth, but he does not own
[1:08:45] the earth.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God's people who he has
[1:08:51] purchased with that virgin blood of
[1:08:53] Jesus Christ are the rightful owners to
[1:08:57] the earth and they shall have that
[1:09:00] earth.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; We will live here. You're going to come
[1:09:04] back and live here. Even if you die
[1:09:06] before the time of promise comes, you
[1:09:09] will come back in the resurrection and
[1:09:12] you will live here. And your death won't
[1:09:14] change anything. It only changes like
[1:09:16] from the interior to the exterior, from
[1:09:18] the mortal to the immortal. That's all
[1:09:20] it is. It's like going through the door.
[1:09:23] [Applause]
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; He says, "What did we lose?" Well,
[1:09:31] it was given to Adam to have eternal
[1:09:33] life. As long as he ate from the tree,
[1:09:37] he had eternal life. I want you to watch
[1:09:40] that very closely. As long as he ate
[1:09:42] from the tree, he had eternal life.
[1:09:45] Adam was like an amateur god over the
[1:09:47] earth.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; The earth was his.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Everything was given into his hand.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; He could do with it whatever he wanted
[1:09:56] to. He named it and called it and done
[1:09:59] whatever he wanted to. He was truly the
[1:10:01] son of God. It was Adam who named the
[1:10:04] serpent.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; And he named things after their nature.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; He named a lion a lion because of the
[1:10:12] nature of the lion. And the eagle
[1:10:14] because of the nature of the eagle. He
[1:10:16] had such comprehension, such knowledge.
[1:10:19] He had he was a son of God and he called
[1:10:22] all the he gave names to everything. God
[1:10:25] stood by while he Adam named the
[1:10:27] creatures.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; God created them. His son named them.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; I can just see when the serpent come by,
[1:10:38] he probably said, "You could be
[1:10:40] dangerous.
[1:10:42] I'll call you a serpent
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; and whatever that connotation would
[1:10:48] reflect
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; right
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; now. He said in the fall Adam forfeited
[1:10:56] the title deed to that he forfeited it
[1:10:59] to Satan and Satan took the title deed.
[1:11:05] Adam was very slothful and he did not
[1:11:08] redeem his right for he could not redeem
[1:11:10] it. Amen.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; He could not redeem his right. He says,
[1:11:14] "But Satan, which does not rightfully
[1:11:18] own it, but he possesses that." He does
[1:11:22] not own it.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Remember, when he comes to you, now I
[1:11:26] want you to be mindful. When he comes to
[1:11:28] you, he doesn't even own the ground you
[1:11:32] stand on.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; He does not own it. He possesses it. And
[1:11:36] he acts in a in a brazen way like saying
[1:11:40] to Jesus, "See all these kingdoms? I'll
[1:11:42] give them to you." The kingdoms were his
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; to give. But the earth that they stood
[1:11:48] on was not his.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; And Jesus had the blood in his veins
[1:11:53] that was going to drop onto that earth
[1:11:55] and claim the earth because it was his.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; And to redeem is to buy back.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Sin was everywhere. Sin had polluted the
[1:12:04] earth.
[1:12:06] But Jesus Christ was declaring, "I'm
[1:12:08] going to buy it back."
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was the worthy one.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "He became
[1:12:15] worthy." Oh, I had had almost a whole
[1:12:18] service on this. He became worthy by the
[1:12:22] virgin birth.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Think of it. He he although he was equal
[1:12:27] with God, he he found himself in the
[1:12:30] form of a man and became he became
[1:12:35] willing to go even to the death the
[1:12:37] death of the cross.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; But the scripture tells us that he found
[1:12:41] himself in the form of a servant.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; And he gave himself freely as a
[1:12:46] sacrifice saying to Pilate, "No man
[1:12:49] takes my life from me. I give it.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; I lay it down." What's the next line?
[1:12:55] And I will take it up again.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; See, a man can say, "I will lay it
[1:13:02] down." You can say, "I'll lay my life
[1:13:04] down." You can say, "I'll go and fight
[1:13:06] for my country." You can say that. But
[1:13:08] you cannot say of your own self, "And I
[1:13:11] will take it up again."
[1:13:12] But the prophet said, "You can say that
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; by the word of God
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; because the very the very Christ that
[1:13:19] you've received, the very eternal life
[1:13:21] you have received cannot stay in a
[1:13:24] grave."
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; So it's not rightfully his, but he
[1:13:31] possesses it. He is the God of this
[1:13:33] earth, the Bible said. So he possesses
[1:13:36] that not because that he really
[1:13:39] rightfully gets it, but he possesses it.
[1:13:42] Satan possesses that. He holds it into
[1:13:44] his hand. Death is in his hand. The
[1:13:47] earth is in his hand. The world belongs
[1:13:49] to him. Every nation belongs to him. He
[1:13:52] governs and controls the whole world and
[1:13:55] everything in the world. But he says
[1:13:57] Satan is a squatter.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; He doesn't legally own this.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:04] And he's had 2,000 years
[1:14:07] of fuss whether he owns it or somebody
[1:14:10] else owns it. Right?
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; He's had 2,000 years to fuss about it.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; But Christ came
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; as the kinsman redeemer
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; and he redeemed it back to us. But Satan
[1:14:29] possesses it. But you know, after a
[1:14:31] while, this great fight's over and he'll
[1:14:35] be cast into the lake of fire.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; He'll be done away with, and all of them
[1:14:41] who worship with him, and the heirs of
[1:14:44] salvation will come with Christ.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:55] God be to show a Abraham what the plan
[1:14:59] was that was held in his mind. That the
[1:15:03] unbelief of Satan and the unbelief of
[1:15:05] Eden would be defeated by the faith of
[1:15:08] Abraham.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; What was lost is given back.
[1:15:13] And you, he said, on the other hand,
[1:15:15] you'll fight for every inch of it. So,
[1:15:18] we're not here on a on a Sunday school
[1:15:22] picnic.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; He said, speaking of God now saying, "I
[1:15:26] swore to Abraham 400 years and something
[1:15:30] some years uh that I was going to give
[1:15:33] it to him." And he said, "Now I said,
[1:15:36] it's yours." He's speaking now of Moses
[1:15:39] and Joshua. It's yours. I give it to you
[1:15:42] to this to his seed and said, "I give it
[1:15:45] to you." He said, 'Now, here's where I
[1:15:47] want you to see, and I would like to
[1:15:49] bring this to you. The prophet trying to
[1:15:52] bring it to the people. He said, 'Isn't
[1:15:53] it strange? He said, ' It's yours, but
[1:15:56] it's just full of Hittites
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; and Jebusites
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; and Canaanites and all kinds of enemies.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; This life that he has promised you is
[1:16:06] yours,
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; but it's filled with every kind of an
[1:16:10] enemy.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; But yet, that does not change. Even
[1:16:14] though it's filled with every kind of
[1:16:15] enemy, doesn't change the word of God. I
[1:16:18] have given it to you. I gave it to your
[1:16:21] father Abraham.
[1:16:23] That's
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; And I've given it to you. He says
[1:16:26] they're all walled up. He said, "It's
[1:16:29] yours. Go take it. It's yours. I give it
[1:16:33] to you, but you go get it."
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; God just didn't sit up there and take
[1:16:40] his brush and sweep them all out.
[1:16:45] He said, 'Now you come on in.
[1:16:49] Here you are. Sat down. Never did God do
[1:16:52] that. He's not going to do it even even
[1:16:55] with regards to anything that we ask
[1:16:57] for. We may ask for, you know, we may
[1:17:00] ask for a miracle. We may ask for
[1:17:01] healing. We may ask for something
[1:17:04] special from God. But it seems that God
[1:17:07] for whatever reason seems to delight and
[1:17:10] sit back to see you exercise your faith
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; that you actually believe the promise
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; that you believe the word.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And every man in here
[1:17:24] that's born again of the spirit of God
[1:17:26] knows that you've had to fight for every
[1:17:29] inch of ground tow the mock with Satan."
[1:17:32] Amen.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Friends, he said, "This is not a picnic.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; This is a battle ground,
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; and we never come here to eat cookies."
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "We're in a battle."
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; I think the sooner we recognize that,
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; the better we'll understand the rest of
[1:17:54] my message today. We're in a battle.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be a picnic.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be simple. You kids in
[1:18:03] school, you just resolve right now.
[1:18:05] It'll be a battle
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; to hold your testimony
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; and to not succumb to whatever might be
[1:18:14] said about you or against you, excuse
[1:18:17] me,
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; but we're in a battle now. Now he said
[1:18:21] before any battle can be put in array
[1:18:24] they first have to choose a meeting
[1:18:27] ground
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; or a meeting place where the battle is
[1:18:30] to be fought a selected place. There's a
[1:18:33] battle front where they meet and test
[1:18:36] their powers. Now think about this
[1:18:38] closely where each enemy tests its
[1:18:41] strength against the other. Now, here
[1:18:44] comes the serpent
[1:18:46] into Eden.
[1:18:48] And they're selecting. He's been cast
[1:18:51] out of heaven. Lucifer is cast out of
[1:18:53] heaven.
[1:18:55] And in God's Eden, in God's Eden, he
[1:18:59] finds an instrument
[1:19:01] that he can use.
[1:19:07] Even when the serpent was created, God
[1:19:10] had looked on everything and said, "It's
[1:19:12] very good."
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Now, I know that you might be puzzled
[1:19:18] with some of my statements, but I want
[1:19:20] you to hang on to them.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; God said it's very good,
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; and the sat and the serpent was there
[1:19:27] and created,
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; God said it's very good. But Lucifer,
[1:19:33] Satan, got a hold of that vessel
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; in God's Eden
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; and began
[1:19:42] to use him as an instrument to point Eve
[1:19:47] to the one tree.
[1:19:51] Amen.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Just so you can see where I'm going.
[1:19:57] In Satan's Eden,
[1:20:00] in the end time,
[1:20:02] when the earth was literally polluted
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; in every sense of the word,
[1:20:09] God came down
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; in Satan's Eden
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; and found a vessel.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; That was born in sin. Amen.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; And shapen in iniquity
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; and come into the world speaking lies as
[1:20:27] he said that the scriptures. I haven't
[1:20:29] found that scripture exactly that way.
[1:20:31] But born in sin and shaping iniquity and
[1:20:35] came to redemption through the kinsman
[1:20:38] redeemer. And God takes that vessel
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; and begins to speak to a group of people
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; telling them about the other tree. Amen.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; That was Christ.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; And pointing them away from that tree to
[1:20:56] this tree.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; And what the serpent said to Eve
[1:21:01] concerning the tree of knowledge of good
[1:21:03] and evil was false. Thou shalt not
[1:21:07] surely die. But when this servant came
[1:21:11] in Satan's Eden and turned our attention
[1:21:14] to the other tree, that statement became
[1:21:17] true.
[1:21:19] Thou shalt not surely die.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Look. And the serpent was saying to Eve,
[1:21:27] "Look on this tree."
[1:21:29] And this servant was saying, "Look on
[1:21:32] this tree."
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; And she looked and desired and died.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; And now this woman,
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, the bride of Jesus Christ in
[1:21:43] the midst of Satan's Eden looks on this
[1:21:45] tree and lives.
[1:21:49] looks on this tree and she's a virgin.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:55] [Music]
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; This Eve became, this Eve became
[1:22:00] pregnantated
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; with a false seed.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; And this Eve, this bride becomes
[1:22:07] pregnantated
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; with the true seed of God.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; That Eve doubted. This bride believed.
[1:22:15] Amen.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; The difference was which tree are you
[1:22:20] actually looking at
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; from Eden to Eden.
[1:22:25] [Music]
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Now you have the substance of the
[1:22:30] message
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; that I want to build around.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; That's why the battle rages today.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Both trees are here.
[1:22:45] And we're fast coming to a time, let me
[1:22:47] announce to this congregation,
[1:22:50] if this would be my last breath,
[1:22:53] we are going to a place where the tree
[1:22:57] of good and knowledge doesn't exist
[1:22:59] anymore.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; In the book of Revelation, you do not
[1:23:03] find the tree of good and knowledge. You
[1:23:05] find him in that Eden, but you do not
[1:23:07] find him in this Eden. You do not find
[1:23:10] them rather in the restored Eden.
[1:23:12] There's only the tree of life.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Only the tree of life.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:25] Some of this just so it doesn't sound
[1:23:27] repetitious,
[1:23:29] but God spoke about
[1:23:32] Lucifer in through the prophet Ezekiel
[1:23:35] and he said, "Thou has been in Eden
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; in the garden of God." That's right.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Every precious stone was your covering.
[1:23:46] the sardis, the topaz, the diamond, the
[1:23:48] burl, the onyx, the jasper, the
[1:23:50] sapphire, the emerald, and the
[1:23:52] carbuncle, and the gold, and the
[1:23:54] workmanship of thy tabs, and of thy
[1:23:56] pipes were prepared in thee in the day
[1:23:59] that thou was created.
[1:24:02] Thou art the anointed cherub that
[1:24:04] coverth. That's why Satan, do you know
[1:24:06] what? He's not afraid of this church.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; He's not afraid of worship.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; He's not afraid of programs. He's not
[1:24:15] afraid of denominations.
[1:24:17] He's not afraid of traditions and creeds
[1:24:20] and how you fashion and do things. He's
[1:24:22] not afraid of it. He wants to be there.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Fact is, he knows more about worship
[1:24:27] than most of us.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; The prophet said he was the right-hand
[1:24:34] man of God.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; A co-equal with everything except
[1:24:38] creation. He could not create.
[1:24:43] Hello.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; That was the one thing he couldn't do.
[1:24:48] That's the one thing he wants to do.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; And the closest he can get to it is to
[1:24:55] take creation
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; and pervert it and twist it a little
[1:24:58] bit.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; That's the closest he can get to it.
[1:25:07] Thou art the anointed cherub that
[1:25:09] coverth all. I have set thee so. Thou
[1:25:13] wast upon the holy mountain of God. Thou
[1:25:17] hast walked up and down in the midst of
[1:25:19] the stones of fire. Thou was perfect in
[1:25:22] all. Thou was perfect in thy ways from
[1:25:24] the day that thou was created till
[1:25:27] iniquity was found in thee. Brother
[1:25:31] Brand says concerning this watch the
[1:25:33] evil controls of this world. Now as we
[1:25:36] read it in Ezekiel 38 and he turns to it
[1:25:39] rather 28 and 12 thou has been in Eden.
[1:25:42] He says now you know because this was
[1:25:43] addressed to King Tyrus
[1:25:46] and he said and you know that the king
[1:25:49] of Tyrus at that time could not have
[1:25:52] been in Eden for it was 4,000 years from
[1:25:55] that thou has been in Eden. Who's he
[1:25:58] talking to? He's talking to Satan in
[1:26:02] that king. Right.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; He said there's He said there's Lucifer.
[1:26:11] He once dwelt in Eden. The devil was
[1:26:14] kicked out of heaven. And the very
[1:26:17] purpose that he tried to purpose in
[1:26:19] heaven, he came right down through here
[1:26:24] on the earth and is trying his best to
[1:26:27] fulfill what he had purposed. What he
[1:26:30] had he purposed. What had he purposed?
[1:26:33] He purposed that he might get a a child
[1:26:36] of God and get her to believe his words.
[1:26:42] So he appealed to her mind.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; And he appealed to the eye gate. Now I'm
[1:26:51] just starting to open up to a whole
[1:26:53] another area.
[1:26:56] So I want you to stay very very focused.
[1:27:00] So he appealed to the eye gate.
[1:27:05] The prophet of God says and we know also
[1:27:09] scientifically that the body has five
[1:27:12] gates or channels
[1:27:15] seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and
[1:27:17] feeling.
[1:27:19] And that the spirit has five channels
[1:27:23] which I help myself to remember. I
[1:27:26] simply call it my car memory.
[1:27:29] imagination,
[1:27:30] conscience,
[1:27:32] uh, affection and reasoning.
[1:27:36] And at least four of those are certainly
[1:27:38] centered in the mind. Your conscience
[1:27:41] and your affection, your reasoning, and
[1:27:44] your imagination, your memory.
[1:27:50] I want to for this morning's service, I
[1:27:52] want to refer to them as kingdoms.
[1:27:58] So we have the kingdom of sight. Oh,
[1:28:02] what would we do? You talk about you
[1:28:06] talk about tantalizing
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; the human psyche,
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; By sight today.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; We talk about television. What about
[1:28:17] computers?
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; What about text phones?
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; What about all this technology that we
[1:28:23] have today? What about all of this
[1:28:25] stuff? What would you do without sight?
[1:28:27] And then you get on there and and and
[1:28:30] with sight and you begin to see some.
[1:28:32] What do you think Satan's using it for?
[1:28:34] Just so that we end up they call it a
[1:28:36] couch potato. Excuse me. He he inspires
[1:28:40] all kinds of traps and sin from that.
[1:28:42] Right. Right.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; And then that kingdom,
[1:28:45] the king of the eye kingdom, the king,
[1:28:49] the king of the sight
[1:28:52] merges,
[1:28:53] merges with the king of the affections
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; and begins to pervert
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; that whole thing. Or he merges with the
[1:29:01] king of the imagination or merges with
[1:29:04] the king of the memory
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; and then doubles his power. says,
[1:29:08] "Remember
[1:29:10] remember when that person did that to
[1:29:13] you? Remember what that person said to
[1:29:16] you?" And then it begins to generate
[1:29:21] within you some reaction,
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; He's looking for a reaction. And Eve
[1:29:27] looked and the scripture says, "When the
[1:29:30] woman saw
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; the tree,
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; she saw it was good for food. It was
[1:29:37] pleasant to the eyes. It was something
[1:29:40] to be desired. You know, the only
[1:29:42] problem was she's looking at the wrong
[1:29:45] tree.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Ernie,
[1:29:52] we have a prophet messenger.
[1:29:55] And I just want to make sure I don't get
[1:29:57] ahead of myself. I have much to say.
[1:30:02] He revealed
[1:30:05] Jesus Christ. That was his whole
[1:30:09] mission. That's why God raised him up.
[1:30:12] That's why God endowed him. That's why
[1:30:14] the pillar of fire stood with him.
[1:30:16] That's why he would not lay any of his
[1:30:17] words fall to the ground. That's why
[1:30:19] when he revealed the secrets of the
[1:30:21] hearts not hundreds, thousands of times,
[1:30:24] it never never missed. Not one time.
[1:30:26] Who's speaking? I'll tell you who's
[1:30:28] speaking. The spirit of truth.
[1:30:31] Not a man from Indiana, the spirit of
[1:30:33] truth that chose the vessel in Satan's
[1:30:36] Eden and said, "Speak this,
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; say this."
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; And that turned the people's attention
[1:30:43] to Christ, the tree of life.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; And he began to tell them things about
[1:30:49] this tree that they did not know. They
[1:30:51] didn't learn it in a Bible school. They
[1:30:53] never learned it in theology. They never
[1:30:56] learned it in philosophy. They could not
[1:30:58] possibly know these things. And he's
[1:31:00] speaking it from a divine source
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; and opening up the secrets of the
[1:31:06] scripture
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; which would go sideways and conflict
[1:31:10] with what man had learned. We're not
[1:31:13] trying to weigh it out against what man
[1:31:16] taught. We are hearing it from God's
[1:31:19] thoughts.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; And he's pointing to the tree
[1:31:23] strange things, things we hadn't heard
[1:31:26] before. And he's not saying you have to
[1:31:28] understand this,
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; you have to do this, you have to do
[1:31:31] that. He simply says this, and I say
[1:31:33] this to this congregation, look on this.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Satan cannot create.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; He didn't create the iron,
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; the steel.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; He didn't create fabric,
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; right? But he began to take it out of
[1:31:52] the earth
[1:31:55] and he developed fabric.
[1:31:58] Oh, we look at it.
[1:32:01] I like that.
[1:32:03] The eye gate.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Gets a hold of it.
[1:32:08] And your friend or your wife says, "Oh,
[1:32:10] you look good in that." I do.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, sets up an imagination.
[1:32:17] Maybe I'm going to impress some people.
[1:32:20] I have to have a certain body language.
[1:32:22] I have to I have to, you know, make a
[1:32:25] certain statement. Come on, folks. Don't
[1:32:27] sound like you've been back in the, you
[1:32:30] know, back in some previous age. You
[1:32:32] know, that's the truth.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:37] That's right.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; And we go into a restaurant.
[1:32:42] What do you What do you like to drink?
[1:32:45] Let me see. What do I want? Do you have
[1:32:47] this kind of lemonade? No, not that.
[1:32:49] That's too sweet. Do you have this other
[1:32:51] kind? Do you have this? Do you have
[1:32:52] that? Is we want to, you know, we want
[1:32:55] it just to be just right for how we
[1:32:57] feel, right? Then
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know you're going to get quieter
[1:33:04] yet.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; And then the food comes and say, "Oh,
[1:33:09] that's presented so nice." When you've
[1:33:11] ever heard presented, I mean, when I was
[1:33:13] a kid, presented, there's your potatoes.
[1:33:15] There's your beef. Eat it.
[1:33:19] Amen.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; I don't really care. Click.
[1:33:24] Do
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; you ever have it? Eat the broccoli. Eat
[1:33:27] that stuff. Eat it. Well, I didn't have
[1:33:29] too much trouble. I I enjoyed most of
[1:33:31] everything. But and that was a problem,
[1:33:34] too.
[1:33:36] But now it's it's presented nice.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Well, isn't it nice the way it's
[1:33:40] presented? So now you know so we eat and
[1:33:44] we eat and we
[1:33:46] Why do we continue to eat? Because it
[1:33:48] tastes good,
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; And maybe all you skinny people, it's
[1:33:54] not a problem for you, but for me it's a
[1:33:56] problem.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; I look at it and oh
[1:34:01] and I can't have that.
[1:34:04] I'd love to have that. Why? Because the
[1:34:06] flesh is calling for it.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; That's the age we're in. When have you
[1:34:11] had an age that was so consumed with
[1:34:13] what you eat
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; and what you drink
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; and how it looks
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; and the appeal
[1:34:21] and and and then all this fabric and
[1:34:23] here here's it's not it's not just man
[1:34:26] that does it. Satan's inspired it and
[1:34:27] they pull out all this fabric and now it
[1:34:30] just can't be fabric. It's got to be the
[1:34:32] right color.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; It's got to be the right color for this
[1:34:34] age. And he's got some demonpossessed
[1:34:37] people in there that are doing all the
[1:34:39] design work for men and women. Well,
[1:34:41] this will accentuate, you know, the
[1:34:43] right part of the body. This will
[1:34:45] accentuate the legs of the lady. This
[1:34:48] this this
[1:34:50] kind of heel or this kind of shoe or
[1:34:52] this kind of, you know, whatever more,
[1:34:54] you know, I'm speaking the truth
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; and it's going to accentuate. And here
[1:34:59] comes a believer sister and well,
[1:35:01] haven't you got anything else? Well,
[1:35:02] what do you what do you think you What
[1:35:04] are you going to try to do? Cover your
[1:35:05] shoulders or cover your elbows or
[1:35:07] something? You know, this is what people
[1:35:09] wear today. This is You mean you don't
[1:35:12] want this? Is this This is as skinny as
[1:35:14] a uh Well, I use Brother Ben's language.
[1:35:17] It's a wiener,
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; It's a skin over a wiener.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; And this is just a this is just a
[1:35:23] stocking.
[1:35:24] Hey, I see I see women dressed in stuff
[1:35:27] today up and down the street. Thousands
[1:35:29] of them. And my socks are thicker than
[1:35:33] their tops,
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; it's true.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Don't act like a bunch of Presbyterians
[1:35:41] now.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to believe the message.
[1:35:44] Is that what the message says? Is that
[1:35:46] what it says?
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; What has he done? He's managed to dredge
[1:35:53] up out of the earth. He does He can't
[1:35:56] create a color. He can only develop one.
[1:35:59] Right.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; And then
[1:36:02] what do you think this whole auto
[1:36:03] industry is? Oh, we just went through a
[1:36:05] terrible meltdown and General Motors
[1:36:08] went into bankruptcy. You're you're
[1:36:09] going to think, you see, maybe I was too
[1:36:11] deep and now I'm too shallow. But we got
[1:36:13] people that got to paddle around the in
[1:36:14] the shallow end, too.
[1:36:19] All you men. Come on.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; All you men, come on.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; You you you look at the newspaper. I do.
[1:36:25] And I don't think I'm a freak.
[1:36:28] I look and say, "Wow, that car looks
[1:36:30] nice. I wonder what it drives like. I
[1:36:33] wonder what it feels like." You know,
[1:36:35] and you you look at it what it it's
[1:36:37] appeals to you.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; And pretty soon you you know, you see
[1:36:41] yourself maybe driving, is that the
[1:36:43] vehicle for you? And does that make the
[1:36:45] kind of statement and all you know who's
[1:36:48] inspiring that?
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost isn't worried about how
[1:36:53] you look coming to church.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. He's not so worried about
[1:36:57] that. And then
[1:36:59] so we're we're we're we're enticed by
[1:37:03] it. I'll say enticed. Maybe you say,
[1:37:05] "Well, okay, we we desire it."
[1:37:09] Be careful. We're not looking at the
[1:37:11] wrong tree.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, I have to have wheels." That's
[1:37:16] fine.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about wheels now.
[1:37:20] We're talking about being enticed and
[1:37:23] being enchanted beyond even your means.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. Preach it.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; He's like, "Well, you don't you don't
[1:37:30] have to put anything down. Zero
[1:37:31] financing and zero payment down. Don't
[1:37:34] worry about it till 2010.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Don't fall for that.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; I'd like to stop preaching right now,
[1:37:45] but I think I should carry on."
[1:37:48] And then you sign on the dotted line and
[1:37:50] you find out on down the road someplace
[1:37:54] that you know you've been kind of
[1:37:57] brought in. Now here's here's my point.
[1:38:00] Here's a very important point. The
[1:38:02] reason why
[1:38:04] and I hope you can follow me now. The
[1:38:07] reason why I'm stressing this and I'm
[1:38:10] going from, you know, maybe one extreme
[1:38:12] to the other is that there is there is a
[1:38:14] line there's actually a line
[1:38:18] where uh necessity we have necessities
[1:38:22] and where we may have wants and desires.
[1:38:25] Well, I'll go to the scripture.
[1:38:29] Now, this may sound like it's completely
[1:38:31] off the subject. It's not. It connects
[1:38:34] directly. Brother Brandham is standing
[1:38:37] and revealing and a now no one notice a
[1:38:40] pillar of fire is moving out over the
[1:38:43] people. So it's over this man. It's over
[1:38:45] this woman and he speaks and reveals the
[1:38:48] secret of the heart.
[1:38:50] Pentecost and the church world and the
[1:38:53] religious world which Satan had already
[1:38:55] deceived
[1:38:57] thought that he was just a gifted man
[1:38:59] and that was a gift of discernment and
[1:39:02] they were missing it. So he said not a
[1:39:04] few times perhaps hundreds of times this
[1:39:07] scripture for the word notice closely
[1:39:10] the word of God is quick and powerful
[1:39:14] and sharper than any twoedged sword
[1:39:18] piercing even to the dividing a sunder
[1:39:22] of soul and spirit.
[1:39:25] never said dividing a sunder between
[1:39:29] body and spirit.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Not between those 10 kingdoms, but
[1:39:35] between spirit and soul.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; And soul only has one channel which is
[1:39:41] made for the word of God.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; And you have your free will to either
[1:39:46] doubt it or believe it. Amen.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; And so here we have now these 10
[1:39:53] kingdoms of the body and the and of the
[1:39:56] spirit, all those five channels of each
[1:40:00] and we see things, we hear things, all
[1:40:03] the sights and the sounds and all the
[1:40:06] design and the civilization.
[1:40:09] Friends, that is why he was saying in
[1:40:11] one sentence, this civilization is of
[1:40:15] the devil.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:40:20] He doesn't speak against wearing
[1:40:22] clothes. We have to wear clothes.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; But it's what kind.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; There's a line.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; And you need to look at the one tree
[1:40:33] which is the tree of life. To know how
[1:40:35] we should dress, how we should speak,
[1:40:38] how we should act, how we should
[1:40:39] worship, how we should do everything,
[1:40:41] you must be looking at the tree of life.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:40:52] Are you being helped?
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; I just have to speak pretty much from
[1:40:59] inspiration.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Now, here comes this messenger,
[1:41:04] Brother DJ,
[1:41:09] in the end time,
[1:41:12] and he has an experience
[1:41:17] And a man, another minister has a dream
[1:41:19] and tells him the dream
[1:41:22] and says, "Brother Brandham,
[1:41:27] this see this mountain
[1:41:29] and people are gathered around and a
[1:41:32] sharp object comes into your hand and
[1:41:35] you cleave off, remember mountain is
[1:41:37] very important. You cleave off the top
[1:41:39] of this mountain
[1:41:42] and there's white rock, granite rock,
[1:41:46] and there's writings,
[1:41:49] but the sun, the sun, not the su n, but
[1:41:53] the s o n
[1:41:56] Christ has never shone on that.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Now, for those of you, there's a little
[1:42:00] bit of swimming water. when Jesus stood
[1:42:03] here on earth a little over 2,000 years
[1:42:06] ago
[1:42:08] and he said to the people when you see
[1:42:11] the days of Noah again when they planted
[1:42:13] and they built and they did all this e
[1:42:15] economic thing was happening when you
[1:42:17] see that happening not locally but
[1:42:20] globally when you see that happening and
[1:42:23] you see the days of Noah and you see the
[1:42:25] days of Sodom the days of Lot once again
[1:42:28] when you see those globally
[1:42:31] then Even that will it be when the son
[1:42:34] of man
[1:42:36] speaking of himself it will be even that
[1:42:38] when you see those conditions let it be
[1:42:41] known that that is the time that the son
[1:42:43] of man I I the son s o n will be
[1:42:48] revealed I'll be revealed up there I'll
[1:42:51] be revealed and so when Satan's Eden has
[1:42:54] finally developed oh the culture and the
[1:42:57] scientific achievement and the
[1:43:00] advancement and the technology and the
[1:43:03] knowledge that has been gained and
[1:43:05] universities and places of learning all
[1:43:09] over the globe and and according to
[1:43:11] Daniel going to and fro throughout the
[1:43:14] whole earth.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; We're there, friends.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:43:22] the son of man I will be revealed again.
[1:43:25] In other words, it will be held a secret
[1:43:27] until that time.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Very good. And now he calls
[1:43:33] a man and and and and and he's gifted in
[1:43:37] a special way and I don't have to go
[1:43:38] into the details and he even William
[1:43:41] Brando himself wonders about his life
[1:43:43] and others see certain traits and gifts
[1:43:46] and so on in him and and he see that
[1:43:48] he's a gifted person a very gifted
[1:43:51] person and then God begins to confirm
[1:43:54] with supernatural crippled twisted up
[1:43:57] child jumping out of his out of his arms
[1:44:00] in a meeting. He He's not trying to
[1:44:03] bring this on. This is just a local
[1:44:04] service. And the news goes and spreads
[1:44:07] all over the world. And a dead boy
[1:44:10] raised in Finland killed in an auto
[1:44:12] accident. And I spoke to the wife of the
[1:44:16] man who drove the car that killed the
[1:44:19] boy.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; So I'm here as a witness.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; These things happened not in a corner.
[1:44:28] The Mormons have a prophet and I don't
[1:44:30] know where his prophecies were. I'm
[1:44:32] talking about a prophet as Jesus said,
[1:44:34] "I've said nothing in secret.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; I've said it in public.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Token toilet. Go and ask them. I didn't
[1:44:43] say anything in secret. He didn't say
[1:44:44] anything in secret. This isn't some
[1:44:46] secret thing. This is on tape.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; This is for you to hear.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Be diligent.
[1:44:53] And I will say to you in the name of the
[1:44:55] Lord, look on this.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; And he cleaved off the top of the
[1:45:00] mountain. And then he said when he gave
[1:45:05] that, oh my, you have to help me.
[1:45:09] He said when he
[1:45:11] uh at that at that time notice in ser is
[1:45:14] this a time listen very close don't miss
[1:45:17] this he said notice in the writing that
[1:45:20] was on the rock
[1:45:23] I was interpreting it for them
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; they were elated
[1:45:30] that's the mystery of God that's been
[1:45:32] not understood for years
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; that's part one
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; he said Could that be?
[1:45:40] Could that be that? He's saying, "Sir,
[1:45:42] is this the time?"
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Could that be that? He said, "And then
[1:45:47] notice, in some mysterious way, we
[1:45:50] picked up
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; out of the air a sharp tool that opened
[1:45:54] up the top." Now, he's talking just from
[1:45:56] the dream.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Sharp a sharp tool that opened up the
[1:46:00] top. In there was white granite,
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; but it wasn't interpreted. Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; There was no letters.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; I didn't interpret that.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; I just looked at it
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; and said to the brethren, look on this.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "And that's fulfilled tonight."
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; I didn't interpret it.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; That's fulfilled tonight.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; And serves as this the time. But then
[1:46:29] the next year, the seals are open. the
[1:46:32] seven angels have have attended and have
[1:46:36] commissioned him and goes back and
[1:46:38] preaches the seals 569 pages I believe
[1:46:43] and never went back and enlarged or or
[1:46:46] change the paragraphs or anything said
[1:46:48] there it is and at the end of it that's
[1:46:50] thus sayeth the lord when he comes to
[1:46:52] the seventh seal he said and notice the
[1:46:55] next thing now a time has gone by and
[1:46:58] the and this dream has now happened
[1:47:01] Amen.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the next thing now,"
[1:47:05] he said, "I took some kind of a bar and
[1:47:07] cut it off." Talking about the same
[1:47:10] thing, "And on the inside was white rock
[1:47:14] that had nothing wrote on it." And at
[1:47:17] that time, I started to the west, which
[1:47:20] is where I went, and the fulfillment of
[1:47:23] it was in the visitation of the angels.
[1:47:26] And I told them all, I said, "Don't go
[1:47:29] out west. people wanted to follow him.
[1:47:31] He said, "Don't come out there." Because
[1:47:33] he knew he was going out
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; for a special meeting with God. And he
[1:47:38] said, "Stay here
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; and look on this till I return."
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "Went for the blast. Return
[1:47:47] back
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; to the east with the Holy Spirit
[1:47:51] interpreting the unwritten word." Amen.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; And then he said, "It can't be anything
[1:48:00] new. It has to be in the Bible."
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; But it was in the Bible, but it had not
[1:48:05] been interpreted.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; And in the dream part, he said that was
[1:48:10] fulfilled tonight. It's not been
[1:48:12] interpreted. When he comes in the
[1:48:14] seventh seal, he said, "Now it has been
[1:48:17] interpreted. The Holy Spirit has
[1:48:19] interpreted it.
[1:48:21] [Music]
[1:48:25] You see the thing is you can't write a
[1:48:28] revealing.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; So the dream you can write the dream but
[1:48:32] when it's revealed it must be spoken.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; So it's spoken out
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; and becomes a spoken word
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; for the spoken word. Are you with me?
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; It's the spoken word that's the original
[1:48:47] seed.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; And so it becomes spoken. Amen.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; And then the spoken word is taken in
[1:48:55] faith in the heart of the believer.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Not through the eye gate or the hearing
[1:49:00] gate, but through the Holy Ghost
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; down into the soul.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; And even against the human mind
[1:49:08] sometimes say, "I'm having trouble with
[1:49:10] that." But something in your soul is
[1:49:12] saying, "I believe that." Right.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; I'm looking down into this audience
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; and I see men and women of all
[1:49:25] stations of life.
[1:49:27] Some have been looking down here. I see
[1:49:30] a brother that was a leader of the
[1:49:33] communist rebels in South America. I
[1:49:37] look down, I see businessmen. I see men
[1:49:40] that are workers and laborers. I see
[1:49:42] farmers. whatever more and you sisters
[1:49:46] but there had to come a time
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; when the word
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; came into your hearing yet
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; but it did not go into just an
[1:49:54] imagination or reasoning
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; that kingdom did not join a force with
[1:49:59] another king
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; it went down from there into the soul
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; and something within said I believe that
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; something inside said I can't let Oh,
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; your parents, your friends, your
[1:50:18] religious associates may have said,
[1:50:19] "You're crazy. You've gone off the deep
[1:50:22] end.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; You're going insane." But something
[1:50:25] inside said, "I believe that."
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; And it cost you friends. It cost you
[1:50:30] family. It cost you jobs. It cost you
[1:50:33] money. It cost you everything. But your
[1:50:36] soul said, "I believe that."
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and he cleaved off the top
[1:50:45] and there's groups of ministers around
[1:50:47] him
[1:50:49] and he went out. Then he left
[1:50:53] and they said he went down a little dip
[1:50:56] and over a little knob and down a little
[1:50:58] dip and got smaller and smaller and
[1:51:00] disappeared.
[1:51:02] Just before he left he said look on this
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; in this Eden
[1:51:12] Over
[1:51:15] here in another Eden was another vessel
[1:51:21] controlled
[1:51:23] by Lucifer who was cast out of heaven.
[1:51:26] And he's saying to another virgin,
[1:51:30] look on this.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; And she looked.
[1:51:36] And when she saw it,
[1:51:39] something set up in the next kingdom of
[1:51:41] the the imagination.
[1:51:44] You'll be like gods.
[1:51:47] You'll know things. You'll become wise.
[1:51:51] Things that are secret to you. You'll
[1:51:53] understand them. You'll know them. And
[1:51:56] she partook and was pregnantated with
[1:51:59] his seed.
[1:52:01] And that's why God cursed him and
[1:52:03] changed the structure of his body.
[1:52:05] Right.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; And said, "The seed of the woman
[1:52:12] is going to crush your head."
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; You can't you can't make that an apricot
[1:52:20] or a banana or an orange.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; And she brought forth two children. And
[1:52:26] one is a liar. One's a hater of God.
[1:52:29] One's a deceiver. One took the even
[1:52:31] energy that God gave him and slew his
[1:52:34] brother. and murdered him. The first
[1:52:36] murder death came and the Bible says
[1:52:40] that then Adam knew her again. Only two
[1:52:42] acts, three children.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; And she brought forth Seth.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; And she said, "For God hath appointed me
[1:52:52] another seed
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; instead of Abel who Adam who Cain slew."
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; And now here's another vessel, a
[1:53:01] different kind of a vessel.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he is he is possessed
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; of the very god that cast Lucifer out.
[1:53:15] [Music]
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Speak it.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Expose this tree.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Speak with such force. It will cause the
[1:53:24] people to turn from their reasoning and
[1:53:27] from their religion and from their
[1:53:30] history in their memory channel to a
[1:53:32] revelation of Jesus Christ in this day.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Speak it.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; And he says to the people, look on this.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; That's all. Look on this.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Didn't say you have to understand it.
[1:53:51] didn't say you have to figure it out.
[1:53:53] Just look on this.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; And the word of God is quick and
[1:54:03] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:54:05] sword,
[1:54:07] piercing even to the dividing. Listen,
[1:54:10] close. I'm closing now. Dividing a
[1:54:12] sunder of soul and spirit.
[1:54:15] And so
[1:54:17] here's this world and
[1:54:21] hey friends, why did this Elijah speak
[1:54:24] so much about the fashions
[1:54:28] and the way people dress? Because he's
[1:54:31] going to the most fundamental
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; part of our human living where Satan he
[1:54:38] he he has he cannot create something. So
[1:54:42] he takes what has been created and he
[1:54:45] refineses it and designs it and fashions
[1:54:49] it and molds it in such a state until we
[1:54:54] are hey when you go to a mall what do
[1:54:58] they call window shopping
[1:55:01] we are looking everywhere and his he he
[1:55:04] what he's saying is we're looking at it
[1:55:07] we're looking at this we look at the car
[1:55:09] we look at that we look at it all all
[1:55:11] its eye gate High gate. I gate. The
[1:55:13] kingdom is there. And then as soon as
[1:55:15] you feel attracted,
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Whether it be a a dress or a suit of
[1:55:22] clothes or a boy or a girl.
[1:55:28] Just take a breather
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; from that view
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; and have a look at the tree of life.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Just look on him.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Just look on him.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look on this word that has come.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Look on the revelation of this word.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; And see what kind of a feeling that
[1:55:47] brings.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Oh God. My God.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; How great thou art. How great thou art.
[1:55:53] Thanks, brother Larry.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; From Eden to Eden.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; That's the only way we're going to get
[1:56:02] to this next Eden.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. And he said when that top
[1:56:08] was cleaved off and that writing was
[1:56:11] there.
[1:56:13] He can't write it out. Had to speak
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; and then the Holy Spirit takes what is
[1:56:19] spoken and reveals it to you.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; You can't write the revelation.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; It comes to you one way to you brother
[1:56:28] Roger another way. Brother Tony another
[1:56:30] way comes to me another way. We all but
[1:56:33] it will reveal Christ. It will always be
[1:56:36] Christ,
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; We can never reduce
[1:56:41] our spiritual life down into some
[1:56:44] reasoning process or some religious
[1:56:47] process.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; You talk about war, all the wars are
[1:56:52] religious wars.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Even in the east today, it's all
[1:56:58] religious wars. Iraq, that's a religious
[1:57:00] war. what took place in second world war
[1:57:03] and all the rest all religious war if
[1:57:05] you read anything about it or see
[1:57:07] anything about it you'll see the Vatican
[1:57:09] come into view the Eastern Orthodox
[1:57:11] Church come into view why it's all
[1:57:13] religious things that's happening
[1:57:26] brother Brandon made a statement
[1:57:28] actually didn't make a statement he was
[1:57:30] an act he did.
[1:57:34] And I want you to think about it. I sat
[1:57:35] in the meetings and I heard this and
[1:57:38] I've listened to the tapes and I've
[1:57:40] marveled
[1:57:43] how one man
[1:57:45] I've never heard anyone else, neither
[1:57:47] have you,
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; stand and say
[1:57:53] he's here.
[1:57:55] I take I take every spirit
[1:57:59] under my control
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; for the glory of God.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Not every soul
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; and not every body
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; but every spirit. In other words, I take
[1:58:13] your affections under control. I take
[1:58:16] your imagination under control. I take
[1:58:19] your conscience out of under control for
[1:58:21] the glory of God. And then when that
[1:58:23] pillar of fire would move over one
[1:58:25] person, he would tell him clearly like
[1:58:27] the woman, if you haven't seen deep,
[1:58:29] called the deep and we just talked about
[1:58:31] it, I think at brother Deepac Titus's
[1:58:33] the other day. And when he stood in
[1:58:35] front of that woman, brother Deeppac was
[1:58:38] saying, well, there was a woman that had
[1:58:40] been called a witch. I said, "That's on
[1:58:42] deep call to the deep." And that woman
[1:58:44] is standing there and she's trying,
[1:58:46] she's just to balance and settle
[1:58:48] herself. She's nervous. And he says, he
[1:58:51] says, he said, "You got a nervous
[1:58:54] nervous heart. You're nervous. Very
[1:58:56] nervous." He said, "That's because
[1:58:57] there's been a lie told on you." And he
[1:59:00] goes just like that. A lie has been told
[1:59:02] on you. Said, "Isn't that right?" Yes.
[1:59:04] He says he you it been you were said you
[1:59:08] are a witch. And they said, "That's
[1:59:10] right. And it was a preacher that said
[1:59:12] that." And said, "That's right." You
[1:59:15] see, he now they heard that. She heard
[1:59:18] that. She didn't know where to put it.
[1:59:20] Now it's in her thoughts. It's in her
[1:59:22] mind. And it goes actually into her
[1:59:24] merges one kingdom with the other one.
[1:59:26] She heard it with the eargate went down
[1:59:28] and became physical in her body. And she
[1:59:30] become a nervous woman, a nervous wreck.
[1:59:32] But the word, the word coming out of
[1:59:34] this other messenger, speaking the truth
[1:59:37] to her, set her free from that thing. My
[1:59:40] brother, my sister, we haven't got time
[1:59:42] for the devil's lies. We haven't got
[1:59:44] time for all of his reasoning. We
[1:59:46] haven't got time for all of his
[1:59:48] temptation. And I'm saying to you today
[1:59:50] as I close, don't look at that tree.
[1:59:52] Don't look at all the glamorous things
[1:59:54] the world produces for us. Don't look at
[1:59:56] what you know what your position, your
[1:59:59] job, or anything else. Look to this
[2:00:01] tree.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; Look to the tree of life.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; Say, look on him.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Look on this.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:15] Amen.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; That's my message to you today.
[2:00:21] The scripture says of this day, of this
[2:00:25] time,
[2:00:29] they overcame him. In fact, is I I
[2:00:31] thought a good deal of what brother Tim
[2:00:33] Tim how God used him
[2:00:36] for us in the camp meeting.
[2:00:39] But he say he spoke and they overcame
[2:00:41] him by the blood of the lamb and by the
[2:00:43] word of their testimony and they loved
[2:00:45] not their life unto the death. Those
[2:00:47] three things.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says to him that
[2:00:52] overcomemeth in each age to him that
[2:00:54] overcomemeth to him that overcomemeth
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; in the leodyian age the age most
[2:00:59] treacherous age of all. Listen friends
[2:01:03] things are moving so fast
[2:01:07] so fast. so rapid
[2:01:10] it's bypassing. Even some of you young
[2:01:13] couples that have your family and have
[2:01:15] your children, I can tell you without
[2:01:17] even sitting down and talking to you,
[2:01:20] you almost feel like an antique
[2:01:23] beside your teenagers
[2:01:26] because they are so, you know, they're
[2:01:29] they're so fitted and and suited to this
[2:01:33] generation.
[2:01:34] Hey, I see great grandchildren,
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; not grandchildren, great grandchildren,
[2:01:42] and they get a mouse in their hand. They
[2:01:43] know exactly what to do. They know
[2:01:45] exactly how to click it, when to click
[2:01:46] it, and what to do. I say, "I can't
[2:01:48] believe this."
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Because it's just moving so fast,
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; so quickly,
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; That's the age.
[2:02:01] But the scripture says
[2:02:04] to him that overcomemeth,
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; And I want to say, please take this home
[2:02:09] with you. There is no way to overcome
[2:02:14] this age by looking at this tree.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; If we look at the tree and what this
[2:02:21] what the tree of knowledge is, don't
[2:02:22] forget it's good
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; and evil. Right. Right.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; What I preach today is to alert you that
[2:02:30] only by looking at this tree here will
[2:02:33] we know where the line is between good
[2:02:36] and evil.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; You have to wear clothes. You do drive a
[2:02:40] car. You have to do these things, etc.
[2:02:42] But there's a line between what is good
[2:02:45] and evil.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; You see where I'm going.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; And only by looking to the tree of life
[2:02:56] will we be able to discern
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; because it divides between the spirit
[2:03:02] and the soul.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; He won't leave us in the dark.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; We all need
[2:03:10] we need supernatural wisdom in this
[2:03:12] time.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; We're facing decisions. We we have to
[2:03:16] make our way through life. So I say to
[2:03:18] you friends,
[2:03:21] children of God, the God that called
[2:03:24] you.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; May he go with you.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; May he prosper you in your way.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; May he ever be with you.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; You're his. I know he loves you very
[2:03:40] deeply.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; That's why he gave himself for you.
[2:03:45] Amen.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; He called you because you were his.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; And you heard him because you were his.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; My sheep hear my voice.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; And another they will not follow.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; And I trust that the word today
[2:04:03] will be food for your soul.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; And guide you in this way.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; My last phrase to you is
[2:04:12] look on this.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:15] Amen.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Let's just stand.
[2:04:28] My dear Lord Jesus,
[2:04:31] I so crave and yearn
[2:04:35] to be a disciple, a faithful disciple.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; I know that that
[2:04:41] is in the hearts of the people that are
[2:04:43] here. I see it on their faces.
[2:04:47] I see a deep yearning.
[2:04:51] When we sing the course to be like
[2:04:53] Jesus, to be like Jesus, it's not merely
[2:04:55] some word set to a melody,
[2:04:58] but it expresses something within our
[2:05:00] being. Oh lamb of God,
[2:05:05] glorious one. I think so often, Lord,
[2:05:09] and you bring it to my mind
[2:05:12] how the saraphims in
[2:05:15] the prophet Isaiah speaking and they
[2:05:17] cried, "Holy, holy, holy, holy."
[2:05:23] Lord, my soul today cries out, "Holy,
[2:05:26] holy, holy."
[2:05:28] A Holy Ghost,
[2:05:31] a holy message, a holy word, the Holy
[2:05:33] Bible.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. a holy people and a holy prophet
[2:05:38] and a holy prophets, the holy one, the
[2:05:41] Lord Jesus Christ. All we can say is
[2:05:44] holy, holy, holy.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; And I pray that you'll fill not only the
[2:05:50] few, but that you would fill those that
[2:05:53] are gathered here today.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Fill and refill
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost. baptized, Lord, and
[2:06:01] refill those that are craving and
[2:06:04] desiring. And if there if there's not
[2:06:07] sufficient hunger, I pray, Lord, you'll
[2:06:09] cause them to thirst after you. Create
[2:06:12] within us a clean heart, oh God. And I
[2:06:15] pray, Father, that you will do uh the
[2:06:18] extraordinary, do the beyond our
[2:06:20] expectation.
[2:06:22] I pray father that you will come amongst
[2:06:25] us and meet every need that may be here
[2:06:28] present amongst us now in Jesus Christ's
[2:06:31] name. Oh Lord, we want to worship you
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; in spirit and in truth.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; I'd like to have
[2:06:41] sing if we would please. I worship you
[2:06:44] in spirit and truth. And I felt I felt
[2:06:48] this morning and while I was in the
[2:06:49] study,
[2:06:51] there may only be one. There may be more
[2:06:53] than one. There might be several. I
[2:06:56] don't want you just to come for, you
[2:06:58] know, pain in my arm or something. But
[2:07:01] you have a a craving.
[2:07:05] You have a need, a great need in your in
[2:07:08] your being and you would like to be
[2:07:10] prayed with. There's ministers here and
[2:07:14] we will just pray for you if you want to
[2:07:17] come forward and stand here. You might
[2:07:19] just have something that you're looking
[2:07:21] to God about. But it's something that's
[2:07:23] been it's very very I'll say
[2:07:28] it's very special, very serious. It's
[2:07:30] something you're at that point where you
[2:07:33] need God to come on the scene for you.
[2:07:37] And there's brothers here in a
[2:07:39] congregation that would pray. And you're
[2:07:42] welcome to come
[2:07:44] while we sing. We worship you in spirit
[2:07:46] and in truth.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Andes, would you come together?
[2:07:58] [Music]
[2:08:06] We worship
[2:08:09] you.

[2:09:16] your word and
[2:09:20] your
[2:09:25] brother. We worship you
[2:09:31] in spirit
[2:09:33] and in truth.
[2:09:38] Lord, we worship
[2:09:41] you.

[2:24:46] under the banner of the Holy Spirit and
[2:24:48] look to you, the lamb of God, the one
[2:24:51] alone who's worthy of all thanksgiving,
[2:24:54] of all adoration and all praise. I we

[2:25:26] and dismal all day. I pray that you'll
[2:25:28] cause our attention, our focus to be, oh
[2:25:31] God, entirely upon you, oh God. Even
[2:25:33] when the enemy comes as a flood to try
[2:25:36] to distract us, to remove us uh from the
[2:25:39] objective that have been set before us,
[2:25:41] Lord, I just ask that you keep each one
[2:25:43] of us uh with our eyes fixed upon you,
[2:25:45] oh God, refusing to compromise, refusing
[2:25:49] to let go of you, oh God, putting a firm
[2:25:52] grip upon you and your promises, knowing
[2:25:54] that they're here and amen, and that
[2:25:56] they're going to bring us to the
[2:25:57] expected end. for you promise us uh a
[2:26:00] shalom, a millennium, a place of peace
[2:26:03] where sorrow and pain and suffering will
[2:26:05] no longer be in existence. Lord, that's
[2:26:08] why we want to thank you this day for
[2:26:10] reminding us Lord Jesus of your great
[2:26:13] plan that you have for us and for
[2:26:15] assuring us of the victory regardless of
[2:26:18] all the opposition. You have given us
[2:26:20] victory through the blood of Jesus
[2:26:22] Christ. Uh and by the testimony of our
[2:26:25] mouths that you made we have been made
[2:26:28] more than conqueror and that the enemy
[2:26:30] has no power even as his head was
[2:26:32] crushed. Uh we know that father under

[2:26:49] thanks and praise for the things that
[2:26:52] you have done. Oh God, in spite of our
[2:26:54] weaknesses, in spite of our frailties,
[2:26:56] dear Jesus, you're determined, Father,
[2:26:59] to bring your word to pass. That's why

[2:27:13] hearts and setting them, oh God, in a
[2:27:16] channel of faith to believe that his
[2:27:19] things are true. And oh father, what you
[2:27:22] have begun in us, you're going to finish
[2:27:24] and complete it. For you are the author
[2:27:27] and the perfector of our faith today.
