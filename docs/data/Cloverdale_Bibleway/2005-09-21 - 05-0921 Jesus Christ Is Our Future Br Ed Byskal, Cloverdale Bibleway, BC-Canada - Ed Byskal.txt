He just wants to thank the Lord for healing his knee. It has s hurt since camp and now is feeling perfect. He has here also my car was stolen our driveway on Tuesday and the police have recovered it. Please pray that the tools that uh are still in the car when when he gets a hold of it. So we want to remember that. Also, brother Ken Buckles has a testimony here. He just says, "I would like to thank everyone for their prayers for Carissa Buckles and baby." Uh yesterday after eight plus hours of labor in the hospital, the doctor elected to do emergency cescareian section. Uh because of the baby was distressed. There was much prayer. Chrisa felt something change and knew the Lord had answered her prayer for normal delivery. She asked the nurse to check one more time. The nurse did and rushed out and got the doctor and he delivered a healthy baby girl. 9 lb 14 oz. Praise God. Baby's name is Lila Da. Did I get that right? Okay. And it says here, uh, mother, baby, and father are doing fine. And grandmother and grandfather are slowly recovering. So, you want to thank the Lord for for the little miracle. [Music] We want to pray for Mr. and Mrs. Hefernan from Indiana. Both are in urgent physical needs. And uh Philip Ashdown has a prayer request here for a friend and from high school. Todd Strange uh was diagnosed with lymphia and is undergoing chemo. Please pray for him and for his soul. We want to uh continue to remember sister Marge Miller in prayer tonight. And uh we also want to remember sister Carmela. Her husband was taken to the hospital this evening. So we want to remember remember her husband also. We want to remember this is from sister Shauna says please pray for Stephanie Price and her family. She is a 39year-old mother of six who was extremely sick with liver and pancre pancreas cancer uh which is extremely painful. Apparently she's she's on the same floor as sister Marjorie Miller and that they told the family that they'd be praying their sweet Christian family and apparently they know brother Frank Fletcher's wife and they have written here I just don't believe this is by chance that she's on the same floor. So may God move on their behalf and reveal himself to them in a greater way. So, we want to remember this lady Stephanie. Brother Chris, why don't you come? [Music] Let us all just gather our thoughts together and put our licks together. Let's rise up in faith as we go to the master. Thank you, Lord Jesus. We praise your name this night, oh God.

Put a smile on your face. If you feel to say amen, it wouldn't hurt any of us. Amen. All right. Moses told the children of Israel, "The Lord shall raise up a prophet like unto me and him shall you." Truly Jesus came fulfilling all that Moses said, then died and rose and give us salvation to declare. We have a message to the world. We have a message to save lost souls. We have a message to those sick and dying. We've got to tell them Jesus saves. You go and tell them Jesus heal. We got a message that makes our lives worth living.

Father, we're here to serve you. We want to serve you in spirit and in truth. We have been worshiping, Lord, in spirit and in truth. Now we come to your word which is truth. It's all true. And we ask that its truths will sink down into the v inner recesses of our souls. Take charge of every mind and thought. Lord, may the thoughts of today have passed away. Lord, may any concerns about tomorrow be forgotten. And may we now come into your presence and say, "Only you, Lord. Only you. You're the fountain that I run to. &gt;&gt; We thank you with joy in our hearts that we're able to be here in your divine presence. Now take each one of us, Lord, myself. I pray you'll anoint me, oh God. Let the people be anointed to hear, to receive, and be benefited. Let the seed now fall into good ground in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, here we are this evening, a Wednesday evening. At least we're not amongst the numbers of uh I understand over one and a quarter million fleeing another hurricane that is swept in over the Gulf and uh they say it's a a storm five now and uh just hundreds of thousands of people fleeing. For some, it's the fourth time this year. You heard me about two Sundays ago, and I I draw a parallel between this and what was happening in Israel. &gt;&gt; And my wife and I were talking and she observed and I thought it was very very perceptive. But this what she had received from it. How that the pressure the pressure from this western countries and not only United States but from all the western countries uh but but I I would say that United States laid the led the charge to displace people in Israel &gt;&gt; and to mow their buildings down. And now that's exactly what's happening within our own coasts. &gt;&gt; It's being displaced by hundreds of thousands more than we're displaced. You don't touch Israel, friends. You don't touch Israel without being affected. And and the two things the two things that she I would say engineered was the removal of the people and the destruction of their homes. And that's exactly what came back. It's coming back even now. and may come back for it's a sign of the time. &gt;&gt; It's a sign of the time. And when God starts to do something, if he begins to use the elements, I tell you, it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a living God. &gt;&gt; And you can't we we just can't say that the things that are happening in the nations, in the world is just happening. It's not just circumstance. God is ordering all of these things that is taking place. And so, of course, we're we're sad for the people that are, but it I tell you, a lot of innocent people get caught in the in the deeds of of men who go against the word of God. And so, we're here tonight and you you want to be very thankful. You're here tonight to catch whatever the Holy Spirit will have for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have your Bibles, turn to James, please. uh the fourth chapter of James which James comes right after Hebrews. And tonight I don't know how much we'll preach, maybe more just study. We'll just see how the Lord will take it. Nice to have you here again, Brother Ernie. We've been having meetings and brother Ernie's been down with Brother Samuel Dale and a number of other pastors down there. uh holding up this banner. &gt;&gt; The fourth chapter of James, we're just going to start to read at the at the 13th verse. And we'll read down to verse 17, the end of the chapter. go to now or we would say come now. You that say today or tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain. Whereas you know not what shall be on the tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appearth for a little time and then vanishth away. For that you ought to say, "If the Lord will, we shall live and do this or that." But now ye rejoice in your boastings, all such rejoicing is evil. Therefore, to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin. And I want you to especially notice the first two verses and especially 14. Whereas you know not what shall be on the tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even as a vapor that appearth for a little time and then vanishth away. You may be seated and keep your Bibles handy if you would please because I have a number of other scriptures we want to be looking at. I want to speak on your future and because it's a very we have a very youthful church. Very youthful church. I go to some churches and all we see is uh gray-haired and white-haired and bald-headed people and all across the whole congregation. We come here and and the gray-haired and uh bald-headed and uh uh and the white-haired and all the rest of it can't even get a seat &gt;&gt; down close to the front. And I've noticed that quite a few have gotten displaced. And so we have uh naturally the younger a person is the more future they feel that they have and the more interest they have in the future and the more long range plans that they have. But I I like to title the message tonight that Jesus Christ is our future. &gt;&gt; I want to say very very quickly and I'll be making some statements that you can write down and keep. There are things coming up in your future that you did not expect for sure. There are things coming up in your future that are going to uh this is for all of us but especially our young people. There are things coming up in our future that not only did we not expect but we're not prepared for in our in our own mind in our own strength. We're not prepared for it. And that is why uh things come up in people's future. I'm talking about believers future that sets them on their head, turns them right upside down. And they said, "I never expected this." There are things which come up in people's future that only not only did they not expect and not only were they illprepared for but it simply and and not only does it turn them upside down but there are things that come up in people's future that turns them away from the path of life and that is the most tragic thing and I would hate to think I would just really dislike thinking I should put it that way that we would have within a congregation like this that we would have uh the prospects of such a thing happening. But it does happen. It happens to be the real world. And there are things that come up and people they you can say throw in the towel or they just turn their back on God or they just become completely despondent or I don't know for what all the reasons are, but there's a whole multitude of reasons. And they do because we've been here a long time and we've seen people and I've seen people turn out of the path of life for the most nonsensical thing. You have too. &gt;&gt; You said where's so and so? Where's so and so? Well, well, what did they go for? Well, I don't know what they went for, but they some of them went for pleasure. Some of them went for jobs. Some of them went for an education. Some of them went for this. Some went for money. Some went for had all kinds of things. And some probably don't even know what they went for. Some said, "Well, I prayed and God didn't answer." Uh or or you know, or or God did this or God did that or they blamed the preacher, blame the church or blame somebody. And you know, that's just exactly the way it happens. And you want to in fact is uh when the little fellas were up here singing, I've got my heart set right. I've got my I've got my mind I've got my mind made up. I've got my heart set right. Right at that moment while they were singing that I had on the computer resolved resolved and being determined and the Bible is full of it and there's one person who is many that were resolved all of them were resolved in the Bible but like Apostle Paul said even when he knew he was going to Jerusalem and he knew what because it had already been prophesied he knew what was facing him. It had been prophesied what was facing him. He knew there was bonds coming. And a man has been beaten by rods and beaten by stripes and been shipwrecked on the ocean and had been in hunger, had been in nakedness, had suffered all of these things. He knew it wasn't going to be blissful. He knew it was trouble that was coming. But he said, "None of these things move me. &gt;&gt; None of these things move me." So God had alerted him and informed him what his future was, but he said, "I have he wasn't concerned about the future because he wasn't looking for easy street." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was just looking for the perfect will of God. And so we're not here tonight to look up for easy street or to look up something, you know, that is, well, if God blesses me, that's not the point. &gt;&gt; The point is that we're resolved whatever God decides to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So future in the encyclopedia says it is the future is the time yet to come. You might wonder why I look up some of these things because there there there is depths in its meaning that we escape us and are just our normal English language. Our future is the time yet to come. But specifically, specifically, the encyclopedia says it's the state of the soul after death. And I really was thankful they had those two statements. But in the second statement, they came right to the point. &gt;&gt; Number one, it is the time yet to come. It's tomorrow. It's five minutes from now. It's next week. It's next month. It's next year. But specifically, it's what happens after death. &gt;&gt; That's specifically, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's your future. &gt;&gt; And we do have an appointment. And the appointment is it is appointed &gt;&gt; on a man &gt;&gt; once to die &gt;&gt; and after that the judgment. Well, if we don't die, we go in the rapture. We're looking for the rapture. If you're not raptured, one thing is certain. We're going to go by either by rapture or by way of the death. And of course, and then after this, the judgment. Well, we know that Christ was judged for us. But we don't want to be elusive about that subject because uh some say, well, how the message teaches Christ was judged for us that he was. You won't pay for your sins. He paid it all. There's not a thing that is there. But we will be judged for how we how we conducted ourselves and what we did with what God gave us as servants of Christ, as disciples of Christ. And we want to uh we want to be diligent about those things. We want to be diligent about the decisions that we have made. And uh I I'm moving forward with the young people as well in the service. But it applies to all of us. We want to be diligent with what God has given to us. Don't you not agree with that? &gt;&gt; Everyone, I believe, is keenly interested in their in their future. And the question is, what does my future hold for me? Some people I find every newspaper, some people religiously read the horoscope. You see how I've worded that? The horror scope. &gt;&gt; I had to even think about it to try and say it right. I've been saying horoscope for so long that I had trouble trying to say it correct according to the according to the newspaper and um and for many it turns out to be a horoscope. All right. The horoscope is the aspect of the heavens with special reference to the positions of the planets at any instant from which astrologers profess to foretell the future especially of a person born at that time. Now, you remember brother Brandham got on a bus &gt;&gt; and he's standing right beside a sailor and he just kind of felt you you felt the same sometime. You just kind of felt strange and and you don't maybe know why. Maybe you never do find out why. Maybe someone's presence that you're in or maybe a situation that you're facing. But he was on this bus standing there and uh I believe he was a game warden at the time uh young man and this woman heavy set large woman looking right straight hard at him said I'd like to speak to you said do you know that you're a gifted person he said I I don't want none of that I he didn't want to hear any of that and this woman then told him you've been born under a sign and there's a when three planets three planets planets came into line when Jesus was born. And every time those planets line up, then God in in in remembrance of that sends a special gift to the earth. And you were born under those same three planets. He didn't want to have anything to do with it. He didn't want to hear. He said, "Tell she I'll tell you I'll tell you the day that you were born." And she gave him the date and the hour he was born by because she was a student of the planets. And uh he says tell the sailor when he was born. She said I can't. Now you know he didn't want to hear anything about that. And we don't believe in astrology and we don't believe in horoscopes and we don't believe in all that stuff. Nevertheless, we do believe we were born at a certain season when God had the planets. He had the stars. He had everything right in place. And it's amazing. We may think we may never know of it in this world, in this life. I don't expect that we will. But just to think, I I would far sooner believe that than to believe I just came here by an accident. &gt;&gt; I just dropped in. God knew nothing about me. God's got all this whole planetary system all going up there and all the stars and everything's in absolute precision and and it is so inexhaustible that man can't find it. He can't discover it. He's trying to discover it. And to think that that kind of God who is so infinite has has a son and a daughter born here on earth and and they just happen to arrive. No, I don't believe that. I believe he had absolutely everything in perfect harmony. And he knows exactly when you were born. He knows exactly that you're here right now. And he knows precisely what there is in store for you in the future. And he's the only one who knows. And the only assurance that you and I can have that that the future will be I won't say it be okay for us but and I won't say that it'll be easy for us but the only way that we know that the future will be as it ought to be and spiritually rewarding is that we see our future in Christ which is the word of God. And it it's much deeper than we can possibly even touch on tonight. all kinds there's all kinds of things and they uh and all nations and all peoples they always interested and in intrigued with the future and that's why they have you know fortune tellers and in China they have I think what they call the yin-yang and uh I know they also have a uh uh fortune telling sticks special sticks and there's 78 sticks and they have uh some some person knows how to handle them and supposed to be we don't believe in trying to peer into the future. But I can tell you one thing, the you cannot take the future out of the scripture. &gt;&gt; This Bible is absolutely full of the future. And it happens to be your future. And my future, the future of every believer and the future of the unbeliever and the future of the makebeliever &gt;&gt; is all here in the scripture. Now, in preparation for our lives, we get an education, for our future, get a job for our future. We raise families because we anticipate a future. We instruct our children, and we instruct them to look ahead. Farmers plant a crop. Businessmen make investments. And they we instruct all of our uh those that are around us. We expect that they will look a look uh to the future, look ahead. And throughout our working years, people plan for uh a future or perhaps a retirement or whatever more all plans all plans somewhere along the line if Jesus Christ is not included will fail. &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. &gt;&gt; And more people are finding, I would say more people's plans fail than plans that are fulfilled. How many people plan for just a glorious and absolutely ecstatic marriage and wedding and future and all the rest of it? And if you took a uh took a analysis of it, it is less than what they thought it was going to be when they stood at the altar. It's not the same thing. I know you're quiet now, but that happens to be the truth because because we have such great anticipations, but yet they fall short many times that and the anticipation is a uh our pursuit of things in the future. &gt;&gt; See, and then falls and spiritually. So, you know, a lot of you young men, young ladies, you you know, you just come with such a surge of energy and all the rest of it. But that's why resolve is absolutely essential because then it doesn't matter what the future is actually bringing you. You've resolved to serve God and you don't care whether it's up or down or backwards or inside out or whether it's good times or bad times. I I came I resolved I gave my life to God. I don't even have it anymore. Brother Donaldson put a $10 bill up here and somebody who wasn't got it. I I I thought that I thought someone else got it, but I couldn't see you from where I was sitting. She said, "My wife said, "No, no." One of the young boys got up there and got it. Well, now instead of instead of putting a $10 bill down there, put your life down there. You didn't give it back to Brother Donaldson, did you? No. You're smiling real big. You put in the bank. All right. And when you put your life there now, not a $10 bill, but you lay your life on the altar and say, "I'm not mine anymore. I give up everything." And the Lord comes and snatches that and says, "You're mine." And you never take it back. You'll never get it back because it's now his. That's the kind of surrender I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; I'm not mine anymore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My life is not my own. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have been bought with a price and we are not our own. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And whatever he determines to do, we say, "Thy will be done, oh God, on earth as it is in heaven. Do with me as you see fit." And then when you come with that kind of resolve and that's the same today and tomorrow and this week and next week and you just go steady and straight. I know I've been saying these things. I've been making reference to these things but that happens to be a foundation stone without that it's in out up down good day bad day. But when you are resolved it a good day or a bad day is all the same day. It doesn't make one scratch of difference to God and it should not make one scratch of difference to us what kind of a day it is. Everything goes backwards. It's going to you got to expect that. That's life. &gt;&gt; But when we think about the future, you know, usually we're thinking about uh you know things that we've prepared for and and uh we we expect uh good things to happen. I would like you to take your Bible now, please, and we're going to turn to Matthew the 6th chapter, starting at verse 25. All right. Therefore, what I'll do, I'll read the I'll read verse 25, you read verse 26, and then we'll alternate. Therefore I say unto you, notice now th this phrase, take no thought for your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor yet for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life more than meat and the body than raignment. Are you not much better than they? And the people said, "Yes." &gt;&gt; Which of you by taking thought, there we have it again, can add one cubit onto his stature? And yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not a raid like one of these. [Music] Therefore, take no thought, saying, "What shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or wherewithal shall we be clothed?" But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you. I want to read the dialot for the last verse. Take take therefore no thought. The digot, the original Greek says, "Be not anxious then about the moral &gt;&gt; for the moral will claim anxiety for itself. &gt;&gt; Sufficient for each day is its own trouble." &gt;&gt; Isn't that perfect? Now, that puts the right kind of slant on it. Be not anxious then about the moral, for the moral will claim anxiety for itself. Don't borrow today the anxiety from tomorrow because when tomorrow arrives, you'll have sufficient anxiety tomorrow. So don't borrow it now and and bear it now. You'll have enough tomorrow. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Sufficient for each day is its own trouble. You might say, "Well, we didn't come to church tonight, uh, Brother Ed, to hear that." But that happens to be the reality. you will have a certain portion of anxiety tomorrow and you'll have enough for tomorrow. So, we won't borrow any from tomorrow for today. And then what Paul or rather what Jesus is speaking of here when he said and I' I'd like you to just notice please in the 25th verse he said take uh take no thought for your life. 28th verse he asks why take ye thought for arignment and so on. The 31st verse he said therefore take no thought and the 34th verse take therefore no thought. Say you know which of you by taking a thought you can add anything to your stature. No. And why take a thought therefore take no thought. And what Jesus is saying because the word thought is to have care or to be anxious to be troubled with cares. To be troubled with cares. This happens to be friends in this age is a plague. &gt;&gt; It's a plague. It's not one just touching, you know, the odd one here, the odd one there. It's like a blanket that covers us all. and and and and some perhaps more than others, but there's a anxious concern. To be anxious or to be troubled with cares or to look out for a thing, it's something that's on your mind. It's something that you're concerned with. Well, naturally, we have to be concerned. The other side of this is the the Bible tells us to be diligent. The Bible tells us to serve our employers with singleness of mind, singleness of eye. The Bible tells us that if we don't work, we don't eat. The Bible tells us all of those things, but this is taking it further. This is a anxious care, anxiety, and Jesus is saying, don't take any thought. Don't be anxious and and and filled with concern and troubled in your mind over tomorrow or over how I'm going to do this or what's going to be in the future because he doesn't want us to take. He says, "Take not thought. Why take thought? Which of you can by uh can can by taking thought can add your stature? We there are in other words we cannot achieve or accomplish what our objective is by all of this anxious concern anyway. &gt;&gt; And it is this kind of thing that Jesus is referring to in another scripture in Mark 4:14. if you'd like to turn to it because he's speaking about the swer in the 14th verse. Mark 4:14, the swer sweeth the seed and these are they by the wayside which the word where where the word is sown. But when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. Now, when we read this, you can just give me your attention for a few moments. When we read this, we've had a lot of marvelous and powerful preaching just over the last few weeks. I will say that there is on a continual basis. This seed of this message is being sown in the hearts of the people. And I feel it tonight. I need to alert you and to remind others and to bring it to your remembrance that Satan is standing ready and by to steal that word &gt;&gt; and have you forget it instead of pondering on it. And then he would far sooner have you distracted over here and become all wrapped up and concerned about something and have anxiety about your life or about your future and about this that you don't have control over anyway. Not that we shouldn't prepare for it. Prepare for it and and do what you can that way. But we're living each day each day without the anxiety, without the fretting, without the turmoil, without the troubled mind. Because that troubled mind is actually displacing the very mind that God wants and needs for your spiritual life. &gt;&gt; You say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly true. I told you this is kind of, you know, going to be meat and potatoes, but we need that once in a while. &gt;&gt; And so we don't take the he said that the enemy Satan cometh immediately. Verse 15. And taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately received it with gladness. And I would say there are that everyone has received the word with gladness. And that still doesn't deter the enemy. They have and have no root in themselves. And so they endure, but for a short time afterward when affliction, they didn't expect it. And persecution ariseth. That was in their future. But when they were hearing the word and oh, they were so ecstatic. They were receiving the word and they were just on such joy and excitement and all the rest of it. Oh, we're here at camp or we're here in a meeting or we're we just had a glorious service and I'm just so gripped with the oh what the pastor preached or what the special speaker spoke or one of the other ministers and we're just so moved by it. You have to make certain that it's not just moved in the emotional realm. It has to be something in the that drops down to the soul. When you hear something that enthuses and excites you, I'm going to give you some advice right now. You say and just take exactly what the prophet has said. You're a triune being and say, "Oh, God, don't leave that. Don't leave it just in my mind. Satan will take it. Don't leave it in my emotional realm because my emotions will change by tomorrow morning. But let it drop down to my soul. Let the seed come down to my soul. And once it is dropped there, it's anchored there forever. Hallelujah. And if you're not a new creature in Christ Jesus, you will become one. If you're not filled with the Holy Ghost, you will be filled with the Holy Ghost. When that word, if you take that pattern and you come to a service even like this and walk out of these doors, maybe we don't have an altar call, you're not prayed for and all of those things. That's fine. You walk out. You don't need that. You just walk out of these doors. You say, "Father, I know according to the word, my eternal body was calling for this for this nutrition tonight. the spiritual vitamins that I received tonight. I needed that and that's why I was there. Don't let me just be excited. Don't let me just be enthused. Don't let me just say amen. I I'm asking that the Holy Spirit will take that word and drop it from the womb of my mind down into my soul. I will respect it. I will love it. I will cherish that word. I will ponder upon it. I'll put a note in my Bible. I'll read these verses again so I can see this person here never expected the affliction and the persecution. But when you have resolved then it doesn't make any difference. Then the next day persecution comes. Well, if it doesn't come down to the soul and you say, "Oh, I was just I I was expecting a great time. I thought we're going to have this old time. I didn't expect this. They're calling me all kinds of names or saying all kinds of nasty things or or the place that I work. This thing's going backwards. This is going sideways. I never expected that. Of course not. But we don't know our future. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you had never if you never even said yes to God, you still wouldn't know the future. &gt;&gt; So, is it better to trust him? &gt;&gt; And we'll go on now verse 17. and had no roots in themselves, and so endure for a short time afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended. And these are they which are sown among thorns, such as hear the word, and the cares of this world. Here we are now, that same word, the cares of this world. This world is filled with cares. And I want to rise up against those cares because they're destructive to your spiritual life and mine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're a tool in Satan's hand. &gt;&gt; Your cares, &gt;&gt; my cares. We all have them. And this world is is plagued with cares, one kind or another. There's something. Now, just assess it in your own mind. What what what consumes your thought? What occupies? And those things that cause us to be anxious about things that is actually robbing us of the time that God would like to take the word and instill it into us to give us faith to deal with that anxious time. &gt;&gt; It's not that the anxious time won't be there. Did you follow me? Did you follow that? I'm not saying that we're not going to have anxious time. I'm not saying that you're supposed to ignore it. I'm saying is that Satan uses he uses the cares and the the anxieties of life to displace the time that God wants for you as a believer so that you can so that you can contemplate and meditate and have time in the word and have time to to just uh be in the presence of God. You can be in your work. You can be amongst your duties. You can be as busy as can be, but your time, your thoughts are given over. You're not allowing this anxiety to to conquer you. And then God strengthens you so you can deal with that anxiety the way it ought to be. &gt;&gt; That's the order of the day of the believer's life. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Amen. &gt;&gt; And the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things entering in choke the word and it becometh unfruitful. In other words, it actually came to be fruitful state but becomes unfruitful. And verse 20, and these are they which are sown on good ground, such as hear the word and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some 30fold, some 60fold, some 100fold. And the cares of this world. Now, uh I was just looking in um a writer has said this about the cares of this world. anxious unreaxing attention to the business of this present life. That was what they set out as the cares of this world. Then the deceitfulness of riches of those riches which are the fruit of this worldly care. So there's all kinds of anxious care about life etc. And then we reap some benefits from it. That's what keeps the person going. You reap natural benefits from the cares of this life. But he said of those riches which are the fruit of this worldly care, the pleasures of life or the lust of other things entering in. And I thought this paragraph was very, very good. I'd like you to just hear it as I read it. The enjoyments in themselves may be innocent, the pleasures of life, the enjoyments may be innocent, which worldly prosperity enables one to indulge in. In other words, the prosperity of life person has an anxious cares and they're we're in a rat race in this world and it has its it has its benefits. Satan has made sure it's got some perks &gt;&gt; and that keeps a person going. Hey, I can tell you some of these big corporations that are very very successful, you know how they keep their, you know, how they keep their men and keep them burned out, giving them perks, perks, perks. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They got such wonderful perks. you know, if if I don't keep, you know, if I don't keep just exhausting myself, I don't get these perks. Hey, I was talking to a young man and he was just burning himself up. He was working 12 hours a day, every day except Sunday. 12 hours a day. Every day except Sunday. But he was they were barely paying him enough to keep body and soul together and they just had one child and just barely enough to keep paying the bills. But the car he drove was such a luxurious SUV, you know, thought, man, I can't afford to give this up. I give this up, I lose this SUV. So, I just got to keep serving this beast. I just got to keep serving it because I got this. And not only that, when I travel, I stay at the nicest hotels and eat good food. And man, I hate to lose all those perks. You You kind of get used to it, you know, walking in the five-star hotel, you know, and fivestar room and feels nice. And to think if I if I get out of this, I'm back down to three stars or I'm just down to, you know, I can't afford this at all. So they they actually keep you going. And how and and so what did those perks do? They kept a man just grinding it out 12 hours a day going home just totally exhausted. hardly any time for the wife and hardly any time for the for the kid, you know, and you know, you're just totally exhausted. And by the time you drive to work, maybe half an hour or an hour and drive away back from work, that 12 hours is 14. And by the time you eat, it's 15. And by that time, you are dead exhausted. And they'd say, "Oh, that's just four days." No, that is this week and next week and this month and next month and in six months. And then they say these perks are six months from now we're going to make you manager. And like they said, you know, that is so you can go from up eight hours a day to work 12 hours a day to when you get to be manager. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's subtle. &gt;&gt; Sunday, you pray for me. I want to speak on the system. &gt;&gt; The system. And these systems become gods &gt;&gt; and they bow before them and they they burn up their life for them. I better stop right there. I'm going to be be giving all the thunder away for Sunday's service. The system, the religious system. Seal my mouth right now because you're perceptive people. You're gonna say, "Oh, we know what he's going to preach." So the enjoyments themselves may be innocent which worldly prosperity enables one to indulge. These choke or smother the word, drawing off as much of one's attention, absorbing so much of one's interest and using up so much of one's time that only the drags uh the drags of these remain for spiritual things. &gt;&gt; Only the dregs remain for spiritual things. True. And a ragged, hurried and heartless formalism is at is at length all the religion of such a person. Just a heartless uh a rather a ragged, hurried and heartless formalism. What a vivid picture of today. &gt;&gt; It always gets quiet when we touch these things because we're all touched on it. And you can't escape when the prophet said the pressure of this age. We have that pressure and and it's not because you want that pressure. It's because the age has that pressure. &gt;&gt; There's nobody here who voted to pay $3 a gallon for their gas and here it's about five. &gt;&gt; Who wanted that? &gt;&gt; Who wants to pay the kind of, you know, price for a roof over your head? &gt;&gt; Who wants to pay the kind of taxes you pay I pay? Who wants to pay that? No, you didn't. You didn't try to you didn't vote for that. But that's the age you live in and that's the country you live in. It just happens to be that way. And we're caught in that web. &gt;&gt; And so if Satan can, he catches us in that web. And so it used to be that if you had a grade eight education, you're well educated. Very few had a grade eight education. Then it was you got to have 12 or you're not getting anywhere. And you got to have your grade 12 uh diploma. And so when I when I was in school, that was important thing to have a grade 12 diploma. Today they just turn their nose up say, "Well, I graduated out of grade 12." They want to know what further education and the college and university and whatever more and what degrees and whatever more and and I think that that's very very important in these times. But that must never become a god. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we don't want to have said, "Well, I served I served with all my strength and all my energy on a material level and had nothing but drags left for spiritual things. I'm talking to a lot of young people here. I would like you to set a course in your life that would guarantee that God would have first place that he will have quality time in your life. Maybe at the expense of some pleasure maybe at the expense of something else. I don't know. But at at least that God and I don't believe that when I stand on the other side I will have to apologize for preaching this message tonight. I don't believe I'll have to apologize for in for just really laying it on the line and uh so that you'd have some guidance now. And here's what brother Brandham said in the Thotyron church age. He said, "A great burden of this last age." And I know that some of you that are here, of course, as real students of the message, you've heard these things many times. But remember, I'm saying them not because I don't think that we've got them. I enjoy reading it. I enjoy preaching it. Again, I enjoy being able to lay it out so that the young men and the young ladies will have this as pillars in their spiritual life. Amen. &gt;&gt; A great burden and it's in the Thotyron church age. You want to make a note. 239 page 239 church ages. A great burden of this last age is the pressure of riches. Now, some would say the great burden of this last age is riches. That's not what it is. The great burden of this last age is the pressure of riches. And as I said a moment ago, it's not us who designed and desired an economy that is costing so much for rent. and so much for food and and all of these things going up up up up and naturally your salary has to go up. It is a treadmill that every living person who's you know in the system they're they're on that and they've got to have a certain amount and a father who has children all the rest of it and believers of the message. You talk about a pressure &gt;&gt; where our our statistics here in Canada, which was released not very long ago, proved that here in this area, a two wage earning family cannot keep their head above water. &gt;&gt; A two wage earning family. And here we are, I'll say for the most part, husbands, one wage earner in a family. And I say to God's glory, doing better. &gt;&gt; When you talk about doing good, doing better than those that are burning it up at both ends of the candle, husband, wife working, kids cast to the television or cast to the mall or wherever they're cast to. It's a whole lot better with a one-way jourer in the in the family according to the prophet's message, according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'd like to say also because I know there's such an eagerness for spiritual things, I'll say to all of our young people, don't be anxious over your spiritual growth or your spiritual advancement. Don't be anxious over spiritual things so that they're a worry and a care and a concern. Just trust the God you gave your life to. I'm yours. You take me as far as you want. You show me whatever you want me to see. You reveal yourself to me, but I will hunger and thirst after you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let that be the pattern of your life. Now, I'll tell you something else. I I believe that these little things are such lessons for us in brother Brandham's life and I take them and observe them and they're so excellent. Now he felt this you know God dealing with him in his in his capacity which is you know as a as a prophet with a message for the world. But you have your own corner, you have your own place. I have mine. You have yours. And we we will have a uh we won't understand. Listen to me now. We will not understand all of God's dealings with within yourself. You won't understand it always. God God's leadings are sometimes very mysterious. Brother Brandham even said to his wife, he said to Sister Mey, "I can't stand this anymore. I I'm I'm leaving here. I'm going up into to my cabin or up to my cave. I'm going I'm going to get away and I got to get an answer and I won't be back till I get the answer. Now, what what is he talking about? He He was talking about his future. He knew that, you know, somehow God was dealing with him, but he didn't know what it was going to come to. He didn't know what the future was in his spiritual life. Now you can just you can stay and just stew about it and and but you but he did the right thing and that is the pattern. He just got alone with God. God God by himself said I'm going to I'm going to find out from God what this is all about. I can't go any further because he'd wondered about it for a long time. &gt;&gt; I hope this meaning something to you. Now, God does not tell us everything about our future. Yet, he promises us a future that you would not trade for anything else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not necessarily an easy future, but a fulfilled future. These are chosen sentences. You want to remember them. The more future you have, the more reason you have to be keen and have a keen interest in it. The will of God and the leading of the Holy Spirit in that plan can often be a great mystery and it will be. People make plans, have short-term and long-term objectives that do not have Jesus Christ at the center of their plans. The world is filled with bitter disappointment. And those kinds of plans will end up in disappointment. &gt;&gt; The bornagain believer has Christ at the very heart and center of their plans and never are disappointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Will there be no disappointment?" There will be things happen that you never planned. But when you've made Christ the center of your plans and he is the objective in everything that you do, then whether it's a whether whatever kind of reversal or whatever happens, I'm trying to tell you friends, there are things which will pain you. There are things which will bring sorrow to you. There are things which will grieve you. But I will say that some of my greatest griefs have come from what I know the Holy Spirit is grieved with. And if you have that kind of grief, I say to you, go and bear it thankfully that you can bear some of his stripes &gt;&gt; and you can bear some of his grief. And if the Holy Spirit is grieved and you are a possessor of the Holy Spirit and you are a temple of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit becomes grieved about something, let me tell you something. You're going to feel it. &gt;&gt; You're going to experience it. You're going to have it. And when you do have it, you won't want to escape it. You won't say, "Oh, God, take this away from me." And you won't say, "God, is this you or is this a devil?" I have all kinds of people. I hear it all the time, Brother Biscll. I don't know whether this is God or this is the devil. Well, when a person's life is totally focused on Christ and he is the center of everything, you will know that it is for Christ's sake, whatever it might be. And it may not be good because Christ didn't suffer everything good. He didn't I mean, he didn't experience everything that was good. Now, God spoke through Jeremiah. If you want to write it down, it's the 29th chapter of Jeremiah. And he said to Jeremiah through Jeremiah, thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives. Now, how many knows what he's talking about? He's talking about Israel carried away into Babylon for 70 years. And so the Lord is speaking to all that were carried away captives whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon. And here's what he's telling them to do. Build houses, dwell in them, plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them. Take your wives. In other words, don't stop getting married. Get married and beget sons and daughters. and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that you may be increased there and not diminished. This was the instruction. What's he doing? He's telling them their future. &gt;&gt; Get a house. Live in a house. I'm not telling you that. I'm telling that's what God spoke to them to do it. And seek the peace of the city whether I have caused you to be carried away captives. And pray unto the Lord for it. For in the peace thereof, shall you have peace. For thus sayith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, let not your prophets and your divers, what are they? Fortune tellers. Prophets and divers. Don't let them that be in the midst of you deceive you, neither hearken to their dreams, which and neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed. He said, "Don't listen to the prophets and the divers who were speaking contrary to the word that was coming from the prophet. Don't listen to it." You know, there's all kinds of voices. Let me say this. There's more voices against the message than there is for it. And a lot of those voices and influence come right from within a church. Right within the message. They give all kinds of instruction and all kinds of and tell you about you know what your future is or you know and they don't put it that way that I'm going to tell you your future. I'm a fortune teller. I'm a diver. I'm a I'm a prophet or a prophetess. They don't but all kinds of advice you know and all kinds of counsel which actually is reaching into your future to shape your life to how you're going to serve God and and all of these things. And then what happens is the outcome isn't what you expected it to be. And furthermore, furthermore, he says he said here and and neither hearken to your dreams. Everybody has a dream. &gt;&gt; Everyone has an expectation. He said which you cause to be dreamed. And and the individual themselves, they had an aspiration. They had an expectation for a certain thing. And he and he and don't trust those dreams. Don't trust them. Just trust exactly what the word and the word alone has said. &gt;&gt; You know, you're here on a Wednesday night and there's always a very wonderful audience on a Wednesday night. You're here not to put in some time. You have left other things undone to come here. you have left uh valuable time, quality time you could have had with the family or doing something productive or or or or maybe some of you could have got some work done and you could have made some extra cash by by uh being away and working, but you're here in church and the reason you're here is because you want to make this a focal point in your spiritual life and you have and you've done that and that's why God will honor you. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we have our dreams and our aspirations. They must come subject to the word of God. And he said, "For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name. I have not sent them, saith the Lord. For thus saith the Lord, that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place. for I know. And brother Brandham takes this scripture. You can if you have a computer system, you can look it up. But he said this was a lovely thought. And he and God says, "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and not evil, to give you an expected end." God is actually prophesying, I'm going to give you an expected end. And the expected end here, the word what he's using, it is a I will give you a a hope. I will give you an expectation. I will give you an outcome. I like to say to the congregation tonight, I'm not interested in anybody else's outcome for my life. &gt;&gt; None of my family. They probably wish the very best for me. And you got and and I know in a congregation you you think the best. You say, "Oh, we just wish you'll just have a prosperous and a happy and a joyfilled and a healthy life and all that." And I say, "Amen." Amen. Amen. I I hope all of those things. But the real future that I want is held in his hands. &gt;&gt; I want his future. You want his future. And we don't know what it is, but the consecrated life will have his future unfolded in your life. &gt;&gt; And he says to give you an expected end. In other words, to give you a hope or to give you his outcome, to give you something that you will wait and look eagerly for. And this is wonderful. You remember when Rahab put the cord in the window? What color was it? &gt;&gt; Scarlet, a scarlet cord, a token. Says, "Give me a token." Says, "You put the cord in the window." And the exact word that God uses in the Bible for your expectation is the exact word for the line, the cord in Rahab's window. When she looked in that window, she had an expectation. She had a hope. And her hope and her expectation did not come from the city she lived in. It didn't come from her family. It came right out of the very out of the very source of Israel. The word of God came to her and gave her a token. You will remain and all that is under this roof shall be saved. Oh, isn't that a wonderful thing? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And she could go to the window &gt;&gt; and see that line there. You know what that line was? You know what that scarlet cord was? Was God's thought concerning her. &gt;&gt; God's thought concerning everyone who would be in that house. That cord was a token or a promise of God. That was a sign of God's promise to her. Hallelujah. And God is saying to us that I have given you an expected end. I've given you. I have given you. And there has never been a people that I know of. There's been no people throughout this 2,000 years of church ages that has had such an authorative vindicated voice that has given us a promise has given us a promise of a rapture of a a of an eternal life and eternal body and a a a change of this body. God has given us that in this day. &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, it's in the Bible." That's absolutely right. But I'm talking it's been pinpointed now. It's been specified. It's been designated to a certain people. This just isn't something that's out there for the whole world. Now he sends a voice. Now he sends a message and says it's for these people. &gt;&gt; I've given you an expected end. &gt;&gt; Something you can look at and every time you look at it say there is my hope and there is my future. It doesn't lay anywhere else. &gt;&gt; It's not in my school. It's not in my education. It's not in my job. It's not in my raise. It's not in my profession. This expectation is here in the word of God. And my future is in the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's when Joshua sent word and she said, "According unto your words, so be it." And she sent them away and departed. And she bound the scarlet expectation. The word is line. She bound the scarlet hope in her window. She bound the scarlet promise in her window. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love it that way. The same word. I will give you an expectation. This was this was Rahab's back there. The people in Babylon had Jeremiah's words and we have a prophet's words. We have brother Brandon's words. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to just end here in a moment. Just bear with me. The hope or expectation is from God. And that is why the psalmist David said, "My soul wait thou only upon God." Now, have you ever talked to yourself? I do all the time. So, you do? Is that where these messages come from? No. But I talk to myself all the time. David talked to himself. &gt;&gt; He says, "My soul, wait thou upon God, for my expectation is from him." Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, you walk down the street tomorrow and all the people are around there and looking at you and you just say to yourself and you're all by yourself, "My soul, wait thou upon God for my expectations from him." They're going to take a side glance at you. Say, "Okay, here now here's your future. The promises of God's people are even more valid now than they were. And I'm taking these out of out of the Bible. I'll tell you in a moment where it's from now. Therefore, go and I will go. Let me ask you a question. If I can read this out of the Old Testament, do you not think it's valid for you right now? Even more so than it was there. more so today under grace than it is under law. Far more so. Far more potent. &gt;&gt; That was a shadow. Now this is the that was the negative. Now it's the positive. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now therefore go and I will go with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say. Your future, my people, your future involves you saying something. Your future involves you as a witness &gt;&gt; because that is your whole purpose of being here and you shall be witnesses unto me. &gt;&gt; What is it I should say? I pray with people regularly. I'm going I'm going to visit my relatives. We're going to see unsaved friends. Pray with me so I'll know what to say. And I tell them, God may give you something to say and he may have you be silent. He may have you preach it in your action. &gt;&gt; He may have you just demonstrate the very Christ that's in you. &gt;&gt; And that will speak louder than even your words many times. And if he has you say something, may it be choice words sent by the Holy Spirit from the very throne of God to the very heart of the people of the hearer of the word. And he gave a promise. I'll be with your mouth. And I felt inspired tonight to give this to you, especially young men and young women, but to all this congregation. God's promise to us, I'll be with your mouth and I will teach you what to say. &gt;&gt; And I say, amen. &gt;&gt; That is in your future. &gt;&gt; That might be yet tonight, &gt;&gt; but it's in your future. And he says, "And thou shalt speak." &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to notice thou shalt because that's not you have but you will you shall speak and then he says he he gave some statements concerning thou shalt said thou shalt say thou shalt stand thou shalt know that I am the Lord. Those three are powerful. And I say, God, let that be in my future. I claim that for myself. Thou shalt say, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This isn't some false divination now. This isn't some false prophecy. This is the truth of God's word. You shall speak. &gt;&gt; You shall say it. &gt;&gt; And God shall be with your mouth. and he shall teach you what to say. And thou shalt know that I am the Lord. Oh, bless his name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'm taking that now for myself. This next one, and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws. Thou shalt show them the way wherein they must walk and the work that they must do. There's something for us to do. And he says, "If thou shalt do this thing, and God commanded thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure." I'm saying to every person here tonight, thou shalt, this is your future. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt be able to endure. I've been down the road a long ways &gt;&gt; and I've seen elder elder men even in the message I've seen them what I would say become entangled in a way that to me brought a great deal of sadness. I certainly wouldn't want that. I've seen young people do it. I've seen young people turn aside. And I'm pressing this. I'm pressing this point real hard. I say to you, in the name of the Lord, don't you turn aside. &gt;&gt; You stay the course. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I've been hearing you say that, Brother Biscll, and I'm going to continue to say it." You stay the course. You be resolved. And say, "I am resolved and nothing can change my mind." And you speak it because when you speak it, the devil hears it. &gt;&gt; Don't let anything change that. Hallelujah. I've lived long enough. I've seen people go through sickness. Go through a tremendous amount of sickness. We were visiting I see our sister Slagger here. God bless her. A mother of Sister Marge Miller. And we were with Sister Marge. Uh I've I've spoken about her several times here, but my wife and I spent with uh Sister Sleer and uh and Sister Patricia Drake and Sister Shauna Grunard. We were all there together and and here's this woman. Sister Marge has been afflicted off and on and uh I believe since 1991. That's about 14 years. 14 years. And she says to me, "Read some scripture. Read some scripture." And she's reaching her little slim thin body ravished by this cancer. And really, I don't know why. Well, I don't know why that thing even is there. and she's wanting me to reach for her Bible to looking for it. And I find her Bible, big heavy Bible. I bring it out. I start to read some scripture and the presence of God comes in the room and and and there she is laying in this bed, what they would call, as far as the world is concerned, in the final stages of cancer. And she raises her little slim bony hands to the air and begins to worship God and worship God and worship God. I say friends, my brother, my sister, we haven't got a thing in the world to claim to complain about. We haven't got a thing in the world. And not one time, not one time does a does a negative thing come out of her mouth. &gt;&gt; A shame to a lot of people. We should not have that. And just I was leaving the other day, I just was slipping away and we were just getting ready to go and I just touched I said, "Sister Marge, is there anything we can do for you?" And those dark eyes flashed at that word just flashed. She said, "Yes. Yes, there is. Pray for my two sons." &gt;&gt; Amen. after all those years. That is what I'm telling you tonight is a Christ centered life. &gt;&gt; There's no self-pity. There's no, oh, pity me. Can I do anything? And she wasn't thinking of herself. Not one word for me. Don't do anything for me. Pray for my two sons. And I made her that promise said, "I will pray for them and I have been from that time." And whether God allows her, do you think I'd be surprised she walked through those doors right now? Not one twit. &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, I'll be surprised if she doesn't come to church. &gt;&gt; I fully expect it. Fully expect it. Not at all. It's not my stubborn mind. I just fully expect it. &gt;&gt; She's too young to go. &gt;&gt; But here's a woman and I can tell you if God takes her home, it'll be like someone said, "The good ones go and the bad ones stay." &gt;&gt; I have seen people go, Brother Chris, Brother Ernie, young people, I've seen them go. And you know, when they were done, I had to speak over their coffin. And you know what was going on in my heart? They were too good to stay, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They were just too good to stay. And God said, "I'm not going to leave them there anymore. I want them." &gt;&gt; Saying to the world, "You've had them long enough. I want them. I want them right with me in my kingdom." &gt;&gt; We don't understand those kind of things. But that is exactly what happens. &gt;&gt; God takes them. And I close with this. Brother Brandham says, "Faith doesn't look at the present." Faith doesn't see this here. Faith looks to see what God wants. He says, "And works accordingly." That's what faith does. It sees what God wants and what God wants done. And faith operates through that. Listen everyone now. Faith has long range vision. It doesn't lower its sight. It holds to the target. Any good shooter knows that. He said that it it's long range. It's a telescope. It's a binocular that you don't look around here. You don't use binoculars to look to see what time it is on your watch. You don't look binoculars to see what time it is on your watch. He said you don't use it for that, but you use binoculars to look way off. And faith does that. Faith picks up God's binoculars, both of them, both sides, the New and the Old Testament. And tonight, I went into the New and the Old Testament, so you could take the binoculars of God's word and look up into not my future, not your neighbor's future, but your future. And when you look up there, you want to see at every station in your life, I see Christ. I see the word right at the center of my life. I don't see anything else. That's exactly how I've placed my life. I'm looking at those promises. And when he says, "Thou shalt," I say, "I will. Thou shalt do this. Thou shalt speak. I will speak. Thou shalt know the Lord thy God. I will know the Lord my God." Thou shalt mount up with wings as eagles. I will mount up with wings as eagles. and every promise that he made and faith sees it out yonder and faith chooses that regardless of what the present tense says here. &gt;&gt; Faith chooses that &gt;&gt; out there. Hallelujah. If I look just right around us and if you looked right around us, that wouldn't give us the inspiration to press on the upward way. We have a guiding light guiding us. And I want the musicians to come. And while they're coming, if you'll bow your head with me. Oh, how Father, you're so gracious to us. and for this uh evening Lord this Wednesday evening as we have spoken and touched on just briefly as briefly as it was on the future the people the future of their homes the future their lives the future of these young people the future oh God that you have planned and programmed for us the future of what is to take place in the earth and oh God whether it's good times or bad times Whether it is uh uh whether it is joyful times or times of sorrow, we do not know. But we say, "I am thine, O Lord, and I've heard thy voice and I've give myself entirely to you." In the name of Jesus Christ, I ask that these words will linger long in the hearts of the people. It's been spoken for that purpose. And we thank you now in Jesus name. Amen. Now, just before we come to a close, I'm sure there's maybe any one of our young men here that would if I said, "Would you like to be Peter?" Apostle Peter. You think about Peter? Or if I said, "Would you like to be Apostle Paul?" Oh my. If I could just be Apostle Paul. If I could just be Peter. Well, those are two that I chose. Jesus told the fortune of both of them the future. And he says to Peter, "When you were young, you just went wherever you wanted to go. When you're old," so he knew just from that statement, he was going to get to be old. When you're old, they'll carry you where you would not want to go. So he knew that something was going to take place with them and tradition says brother Brham also confirms it that they crucif he said they didn't want to be crucified the way his wife his way his lord was crucified and so they crucified him upside down but that was his future and can you just imagine can you imagine now living every day of his life I got this in my future here. When I was young, I just went wherever I wanted to go. I went with all my friends. I did I did I went fishing. I did all of these things when I was young. What I have in my future is they're going to take me. Somebody's going to pack me where I don't want to go. But that is what Jesus said. And so, you know what? My if he made here's my whole service. If he made Jesus Christ the center of his life, then he could say, "Somebody's going to take me where I don't want to go, but yet I want to go there because he said I was going to go there." &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul, he's blind. He's just been smitten down by this great light. Who art thou, Lord? I'm Jesus, whom thou persecutest. It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks. and they send him into the into the city and God speaks to Ananas that he comes and pray for him and says, "Show him. I will show him what great things he will suffer for me." Those are two things. We're we're not in a real suffering age. We uh it's not an age that's really uh dedicated to that. But I believe that the believers of this message are going to have greater squeezes yet. We have plenty of squeezes now, but we going to have more squeezes yet. Do you know that what you believe, what you believe deep down in your heart and what's written in this word of God and written in this message is so foreign to this age. It is absolutely foreign language to this age. And the position that you have on things is considered abs. In fact, his brother Donaldson was just telling me he said, "You know this message?" He said, "Uhuh, I was called by a minister when we talked about how ladies live and how women of the message dress." You know what the pastor said? He said, "You people are idiots." That's really what people think. They think they think it's very, very strange. They think it's absolutely strange. They think it's wild. &gt;&gt; They think it's insane. True. &gt;&gt; In fact, it's just turned completely around because the insanity is on the streets. And here, can you imagine that people with such nakedness and such debauchery and such sin that's taking place and murders and rape and all of these things and turn around and look at believers and say, "You're crazy." &gt;&gt; How the things turn from that which is clean completely to the unclean. &gt;&gt; And that which is clean, they call unclean. That which is unclean they call clean. That which is unclean they call normal. We live in a very abnormal age and this is not a this is not a negative message but that happens to be the reality. And so I'm talking to you about your future and it is going to intensify. If this would be the last message I'd preach, you'll recall this service and you'll say that's exactly right. We've been told that well you we kind of believed it but I feel I need to enforce it so that we don't have some euphoria euphoria you know about uh how things are going to be you know it may not be that way at all it may not just be an easy street at all it may be very very difficult times that we enter into but I say whatever it is if we've made Christ the center then then you're going to have good success. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to sing uh Sister Elizabeth, I want to sing beautiful Star of Bethlehem. I don't have the a number. There we are. Giving a light, guiding the wise men on their way and are guiding wise men and wise ladies today. Wise believers. Let's stand, shall we?

That's all I want to hear. &gt;&gt; Well done. &gt;&gt; Enter in. &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends. Think of it. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be worth an entire lifetime of future for that kind of a future?

[Music] Gracious heavenly father, we are indeed the most blessed people on this earth. Father, Lord God, you've given us another time to gather together with our brothers and sisters, Lord God, around your word, Father. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Lord God, you must love us so much. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, time upon time upon time upon time, we've come here with thoughts upon our heart, upon our mind, Lord God, and your Holy Spirit has gone forth and just preached to each one of us individually, Lord God. Lord God, the evil one, Lord God, would love to get our eyes off of you, Lord, but &gt;&gt; his ws have been uncovered, Lord God. Father God, you've given your army, your soldiers, Lord God, the weapons that we need, Father, to fight the enemy, Lord God. Father God, you've given us a yielded vessel in our pastor, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Father, he knows what we have need of. You know what we have need of. You laid it upon his heart, Lord God. You set the man to the side. Your Holy Spirit has given him uncction, Lord God. And Father, we've heard, we've received, Father, and now we want to manifest what we've heard, Lord. Tomorrow morning, Lord God, tomorrow Satan's going to hit us between the eyes, Lord God. He's going to want to take our mind upon off the word that we've heard, Father. Lord God, with laser beam accuracy, Lord, Father, while it's all dropping down around us, may we keep our eye upon you, Father, upon the goal, Lord God. Father, as we're going down the road, it's just telephone poles along the side, but Father, keep us upon the road, the straight and narrow road, Lord God. Father, may we go tomorrow, Father, with you upon our mind, with you in our hearts, Father God, knowing that you're leading, that you're guiding, that you're guarding our every footstep, Father, you've been so wonderful, Lord God, to give us the word, Father. So much word, like so much good food. Father, the food drives us. But Lord God, your food is eternal life unto us, Lord God. your word, Father, as he strikes us tomorrow or whenever it might happen to be, Father, may that word that you've given to us in so many times that we've been in through these doors, Lord, the word that you've laid upon our heart, Lord, let us drop from our mind to our soul to be manifested, Lord God, let it be lived out through us, Father. Lord God, may our lives be a living testimony for you, Lord God. Yielded vessels for you, Father. Lord God, we thank you for the word that you've given us tonight, Lord. Father, we just don't want it to go in our ears and be gone. Father, we want to live it. We want to manifest it. We want to be it. We want to be sons and daughters in whom you're pleased to dwell in. Father, that's our desire. And like brother Derek said, Father, &gt;&gt; we want to be &gt;&gt; that picture that you have of us that was painted. We will be what you want us to be, Father. yielded vessels, yielded children of yours, Father. Lord God, now as we leave this place, Father, we ask that you go with us, Father. Each and every one of us, Lord, be with us in a special way, Father. May we go praying, Father, getting ourselves prepared for Sunday morning. Yes. Sunday evening, Lord God, praying for whoever delivers the word, Lord God, coming in anticipation, Father. We've just seen your word coming forth greater and greater and greater, Lord God, not only in the word coming forth, but Lord God, your word being made manifest in our lives, Father. Lord God, now we just take and turn everything over into your hands again, asking that you would go with us in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Dear brother Wes, I say God bless you and may the life of Jesus Christ be seen in you by all that is around you, all that are near you. I pray that he'll be visible. He will be heard.
