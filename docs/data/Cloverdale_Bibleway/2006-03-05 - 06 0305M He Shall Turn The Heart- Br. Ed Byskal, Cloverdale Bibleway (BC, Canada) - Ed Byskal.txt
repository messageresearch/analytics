Glory to your name, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to your name, Lord Jesus. [Music] Amen. And we've got a number of requests this morning. I'm going to ask our brother Tom Ray. Brother Tom, if you'd come and open the service in a word of prayer. Um, some testimonies first. Sister Leverne Clemens says, "Uh, I requested prayer for a young man, Grant Gerkin, in Houston, Texas, who had a brain tumor so large it fractured his skull, was very entwined in his brain and optic nerve of both eyes. surgery was on February 22nd. He is doing so well. He is up and about his business. When his dad, who was an officer in a bank, received word by phone that the tumor was not cancerous, he shouted, "Praise God." So loud his shout was heard all over the offices in the bank. His family sends thanks for the prayers. Amen. Brother Nathan, Sister Heidi Davis, want to thank the family of God for all the love they've shown and all the prayers. Our daughter Eliza is doing wonderful for the last 5 days. She's been off the respirator and breathing on her own. &gt;&gt; Praise God. [Music] Sister Patty Petting said, "I would like to publicly praise God for my healing. For months, eight or more, I've been plagued with severe pain in my right leg. On Monday, I woke up with absolutely no pain. Praise God. Over and over again. Amen. She wants to thank all those who's prayed. We've got a God who could heal. Amen. Saints, he's here this morning. If you've got a need, we're going to read these needs that have been pinned down here. Sister Diana Johnson is requesting prayer for uh her cousin Sonia. Tomorrow, she's going for a scan test to the brain because of terrible pains that she's having. um uh in her head. Um Sister Norma Smith has been scheduled for a 10 and 1/2 hour cancer surgery tomorrow, March the 6th. Please pray that the Lord will guide the surgeon's hand and all will go well, but above all that the Lord will receive glory. Sister Roxan Hoffman is asking we would continue to pray for her dad. Uh he's supposed to be released from the hospital tomorrow. He was told by the doctor on Friday that the cancer is now in his liver. He's getting around on his own now and able to eat. They want to thank everyone for their prayers and support. Sister Lana requesting prayer for uh her plumber's son Jodie Zestchuck is going in for surgery, brain surgery on March the 21st. Um uh Ed Zeschuk, I guess it's the father, has taken books and take tapes and has asked the church to pray for his son and sister Becca Lamb is requesting prayer for a family. Um because on Thursday, my grandpa Lamb died. So we want to remember uh the Lamb family. Man, if you're here this morning, you've got a need. The Lord knows what it is. If you're on the internet and you've got a need, you just take it before the Lord as you go to prayer now to the top. Only believe, only believe. All things are possible. These are desperate, desperate needs. And I believe that God is able to meet these needs this morning as we go to prayer. Holy, [Music] holy, [Music] all things are possible. Holy, holy, all things are possible. [Music] Father, with my hands, [Music] Lord, over these requests this morning, we believe that all things are possible to them that believe. We've heard the testimonies this morning of your amazing grace. Lord, even as that tumor was growing and cracking a skull, my heart was just moved. And now we hear the report. All is well. What a mighty God we serve this morning. Angels bow before him. Heaven and earth adores him. What a mighty God we serve. All we're saying this morning with my hands on these requests. Once more, Lord, would you move on the behalf of these requests this morning? Once more, Lord, would you touch the hands that are raised in faith to you, Lord? that they could leave the house of God delivered in the name of Jesus Christ. And Lord, we'll give you the glory. We'll give you the praise, do your holy name. For we believe in the power of your resurrection, that you are alive and well, living in me to tell. The resurrected one is here. And so, Father, we're asking that you will come amongst us in a special way from heart to heart. individual to individual that they could praise you this morning as they leave the house of God that they could declare all is well between my soul and the savior. Would you anoint the servant of God, our dear pastor this morning? Anoint the man of God to speak thus saith the word. Lord, that's all we're interested in this morning. That the word become alive to our souls. Bless him, use him, anoint him, Lord, and anoint our ears to hear what the spirit would say to the church. And those that have joined with us, bless them, Lord, on the internet, whatever medium has been used, that they have connected with us, whether it be by phone, whatever way, Lord, by the computer. We pray that you'll move in their rooms, that the same presence that is here would be with them. For we know wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there I will be in your midst. So bless the service. Bless each one we pray in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. [Music] We want to welcome all those who are visiting with us this morning. Happy to have each and every one of you here. It's good to see you, brother Ben. God bless you. And uh any others are here, we want to make a special welcome. Um Brother Luke has a special for us this morning. Brother Luke, why don't you come? And uh those that are playing with them, if they can get ready, uh just one announcement. There's a young people's choir practice this afternoon at 3:00 here at the church. And uh while they're getting ready, let's sing together. I am redeemed, bought with a price. Amen. Are you redeemed this morning? You should be able to sing this song. I am redeemed. I will Jesus. Heat. Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Oh, heat, heat. Yeah. Heat. I am free. [Music] [Music] [Music] Must Jesus bear the Cross along and all the world go free. [Music] No, there's a cross for everyone. And there's a cross for me. [Music] The calm secreted cross I'll bear till death shall set me free. and then go home. my crown to wear. Oh, there's a ground for me [Music] upon the crystal pavement down at Jesus. He said feet with joy I'll cast my gold then crown and p his dear name repeat oh precious cross Oh glory. Yes. Crown or resurrection [Music] day. [Music] The angels from the stars come down and bear my soul away. [Music] The angels from the stars come down and bear my soul away. [Music] Sing that last uh verse together. Oh, precious cross. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Oh, heat, heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Amen. As we're turning to the word now, let's sing together. Word of God, ever true, changing me. Has it changed you? &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's sing it together. We'll start with the first verse. Holy words long preserved for our walk in this world. We got the word [Music] [Music] of Changing me. We have the word of God. Heat. Heat. All right. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we want today. &gt;&gt; The inspiration &gt;&gt; of the word of God. Hallelujah. I believe God loves his word. &gt;&gt; He loves the message &gt;&gt; more than we do. It's his word. Amen. Nice to be with you this morning. And uh I kind of wish I was sitting elsewhere and listening to someone else preach. That would have been nice. But here we are standing at the post of duty. And so you pray for me and I've already prayed for the meeting many times. And so I just believe that the Lord will have his way. We're always so thankful for what God is doing. And from week to week, we couldn't uh we couldn't even begin to relate everything that he does. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Just so wonderful. Marlo, we heard such a good report of your journey, your trip. my uh what God did with our sister Mara and it's s such a remarkable testimony. We just are so thankful and um cannot express ourselves completely the the supernatural things that God is doing just marvelous. Hallelujah. And that's just such a I'm sure it's such a witness, brother Vile, to you and your family of what God is doing. We hope somehow we can get to hear some of these things that's happening. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Um I'm going to without taking any delay going to turn to the word. Before we do, I'd like to sing. I've been singing for last 2 three days in the presence of Jehovah. And I'd like to have you stand while we sing it. Brother Rod, if you'll help me, please [Music] God Almighty. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] in the praise. [Music] We're going to sing it again. But I'd like to say to this waiting congregation, both visible and those that are not visible in the sanctuary, but are with us on the internet, the telephone, there is one here that knows exactly what your need is. And there are hearts that need to be mended. There are lives that need to be delivered. And you know, if it wasn't available, that would be one thing, but it's really sad if someone comes right to the source and doesn't get it. &gt;&gt; The source is here. &gt;&gt; The healer is here. The deliverer is here. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you come oppressed, you come down, downcast, heavy in heart, there's someone here to lift that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe that with all your heart? We're here in the presence of not of one another. That's one thing. Sometimes we get intimidated being in the presence of one another. Get close and we don't like to open up. But there's somebody here, friends. We want to forget everyone else in the presence of Jehovah. Let's sing it to him. Sing it because we believe it. Let's glorify him in the presence of God of the Lord mighty. on me and heart in the presence of our lovely Lord Jesus. Jehovah Savior, we are so grateful this morning that you so directed our lives in such a way, guided footsteps of those that perhaps were total strangers to us. And by one means or another, you brought the gospel, the light of the message to our hearts. We were in darkened places, oh God. We were in with troubled minds and confused and some may even be in that state today yet. But here you are. And Lord, we acknowledge we're in the presence of the unseen, the invisible God who has manifested himself in no uncertain terms. And you've made yourself known. I pray that this congregation today with one voice will give you praise and glory that is due to you out from their souls. redeemed souls as they have sung a short time ago, redeemed, redeemed. And we can say, Lord, with everything that's in us, we are desiring that you will be present, that you will be glorified. We do not only want to ask you to do these things for us, but we want to serve you, Lord, today. We want to come and lay our lives down as a sacrifice. And we trust that the incense of the sacrifice would be sweet, a sweet smelling savor to you. And now, Lord, [Music] Savior, Master, you're in charge of every detail. And you saw the people as they entered in here. You know precisely where they are spiritually. You know just exactly what they need. And I would ask that you will come. Would you be in attendance with me, Lord? I pray that you will so be the speaker. May it be nothing, Lord, but lips that are dedicated to your service now. Speak by the Holy Spirit, oh God. Go direct to the heart, I pray, and mend that needs to be mended. I pray you'll build us up in the most holy faith, and we will be sure to give you all the praise and glory. I ask Father that every demon power will be bound and cast out from amongst the people that all doubt will leave, all fear will leave, oh God. And may your people be able to just relax and rest in be refreshed today, strengthened in the inner man, and go out from this place, Lord, fit and ready for the life that is before us in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Take your Bibles if you would, please, and turn to the last book of the Old Testament. We're going to read Malachi 4. It's only six verses long and very familiar to all of us, I'm sure. Malachi before we read Malachi is uh if you were to read the whole book and just kind of digest what God is speaking through the prophet Malachi. it really uh the summary of it would be that the people had gone away from God. And furthermore, they didn't even quite understand that themselves. The people didn't understand that. And they asked, you know, where have we wearied God? Where have we robbed God? where they they they seemed to be completely bewildered at the fact see they weren't only away from God but they had become dull they had become numb to the whole thing and where where have we done these things and so on and God told them in no uncertain terms that not only the people the priests also they've gone away from God and uh so then the third chapter starts, "Behold, I will send my messenger." See, this is the solution to the fact that the people had gone away from God. This was the solution. I'll send my messenger before my face and he'll prepare the way. And and and chapter three, chapter 1 and two tells about how the people gone away from God. Chapter 3 and four tells about how God's going to bring them back. and chapter three for the Old Testament Jews at the end of the Jewish age. And chapter four at the end of the Gentile age, behold, I'll send you Elijah the prophet, and he'll turn the hearts. And so that's where we're going to be reading. For behold, first verse of chapter 4, for behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yay, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble. And the day that cometh shall burn them up, sayeth the Lord of hosts, and it shall leave them, neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings. And you shall go forth and grow up as calves in the stall, and you shall tread down the wicked, for they shall be ashes under the souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this, sayith the Lord of hosts. Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb, for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord, and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. Father, we pray now that you will take your word, this is your word, and that you will indeed break the bread to us, oh master, Lord Jesus, and feed your sheep in your name, Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Appreciate your full attention this morning. You can rejoice while we preach. It's fine. I want to speak on He shall turn the heart. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. In both our natural and our spiritual life, either either one or both together, we arrive at junctions, corners, places in our life that are perhaps more critical than the everyday, you know, just the humrum of living. We come to we come to a certain season in our life and uh we're it seems like perhaps we're thrust into it or we are uh we are almost imperceptibly brought into it and we have to we have to make major decisions. Sometimes it crises. Sometimes it's just uh the normal course of life, but we're we're brought into these times and it requires to turn this corner. It requires some very skillful and careful maneuvering to get around the corner. Uh when it comes to driving the highways today, uh a lot of accidents and and uh uh things that happen along the road h actually happen at curves and you'll see signs along the road. Caution and you'll see the wavy sign that's indicating you're coming into an area of a lot of curves and uh you need to be careful. You need to drive with more caution because this is where a lot of this is an accidentprone area and you have to be careful. Corners is where the uh trouble can be and it will will require uh uh a movement where a person has to be skillful and use some dexterity in order to maneuver. the the thing that is being turned here and I need to just draw your attention. He shall turn the heart. If you're turning a vehicle, uh, at least most of the vehicles I would imagine out in the parking lot today have what they would call power steering or their power assisted steering. And that's just simply makes it easier for you to maneuver the the uh couple ton vehicle that you're driving. And uh so it depends on what it is that you need to turn and they try to give you something that would be appropriate to handle that piece of equipment or whatever it might be. you that handle industrial equipment, you know what I speak of when I say that they have they have equipment that is uh that is so uh it it requires to be turned almost at right angles at at 180° and quickly. It can't take a half a mile to do it. You have to turn it very very quickly. So they've got it equipped and they've got the power systems in place so it can articulate itself and turn very very quickly and so it it just depends what it is you are turning and what is the the requirement at the time. Well in this case we're talking about uh not a piece of equipment but we're talking about something else and that is the heart. It takes perhaps a great deal of skill to turn a ship or to turn a piece of equipment, but I can tell you it takes God Almighty to turn the heart. &gt;&gt; And he shall turn the heart, the inner man, the mind. Oh, that mind. Every one of us have it to turn the mind. When Peter preached his first service after being filled with the Holy Spirit and the men were pricricked in their heart and they said, "What must we do to be saved?" Said, "Repent at number one." And the word repent is strictly change your mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, you can't just stand and say, "Okay, I'll change my mind." That's just not possible. I'll just change my mind. No, you can't change your mind in in the in the language that we're speaking of the Bible. It takes God Almighty by the Holy Spirit to come into your in into your being. But when what the scripture is saying here that he shall turn the heart he will turn the heart that this this mind uh there something they were pricricked in their heart. What must we do? Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. But none of that will happen without the changing of the mind. And there may be some here today that need to say, "God, change my mind. &gt;&gt; Bring me to a place of repentance." &gt;&gt; Do you know there's a lot of people that know it's true? They know the word of God is true. They know the message is true. They know that this is the messenger. They know that God sent a prophet. There's too much proof of it, but they haven't had their minds truly changed yet. I'm talking about a repentance. Because repentance doesn't only mean to change your mind. It means also to abhore your past. &gt;&gt; So a lot of people they come to the place where they say yes I I can see that. Yes I believe that. But they don't abhore their past abhore it detest it. &gt;&gt; We must turn from sin or turn from unbelief &gt;&gt; in order to make a full repentance. We abhore our past. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can't love what God is leading you into and love your old denomination or your old beliefs or your old way or your old life. You can't love your sinful life &gt;&gt; and walk on with God. You've got to turn from that and turn to him. That is turning. And oh, that's a difficult turn. &gt;&gt; That is a difficult turn. And it takes real skillful working of the Holy Spirit. So the heart is not only the inner man, the mind. It is one's understanding, right? Even down to the soul. It's our knowledge. I just want to stop there a moment. So often you you may even be here this morning and you'll hear things and say, "Well, that isn't what I heard when I was a child or when I went to church or when I went to catechism or when I went to Bible school or when I went when I went to my congregation." That isn't what my uh priest or rabbi or preacher or whatever said. But God didn't say he'll send you a preacher. He didn't say he will send you even a pastor. Said I'll send you a prophet, one to whom the word comes to. And I wouldn't dare declare anything that he hadn't already declared today. So the understanding I came to a place in my own life when I began to hear things in the message I thought wow that's different than I was taught that I understand and then I stopped one day I remember very clearly I came to a place in my life I thought uh where did I learn what I understand what I know where did I learn it I just asked myself that where did I learn where did I get this knowledge that I have. And I thought, well, I learned some of that in Sunday school as a child. I learned some of that in Sunday school. And I learned a lot of that uh just by almost by a process of osmosis. &gt;&gt; I sat in church and I heard this preacher and heard that preacher and it was just kind of what everybody accepted. And so, uh, that's where I gained my knowledge. And then I now I found out I was hearing somebody saying this is thus sayaeth the Lord and I tried to compare that with my understanding and I just figured time to chuck my understanding out. This didn't come with any this didn't come with any vindication at all. This didn't come with any proof whatsoever. This didn't come with thus sayith the Lord. I think I'll just repent &gt;&gt; and turn away from that. And you couldn't give me that for anything today. It has no place in my life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So your understanding and the knowledge and your thinking and your reflection and your memory, your inclinations, your resolutions, things that you were so resolute and so determined over, your will and your conscience. That's the heart, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You put all of that together and it's a big package. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God's got to turn that. Not only that, your heart is the seat of your appetites, your desires, your passions. It's the seat of that right down to the very inner depths. And you got to change your appetite. How many have had their appetite changed? Amen. We've had our appetite changed. &gt;&gt; We got our diet changed. And in the now, he's going to turn that. And to turn that is to move to face in a particular direction. You've been going a certain way, certain belief, certain understanding, certain desire, certain appetite, and we moved in that direction. And now something's something's going to take place that's going to actually turn. You know, some people look upon themselves like the Queen Mary ship. Well, I got a lot of time to turn. I understand it takes a long time to turn a ship. &gt;&gt; No, we haven't got we haven't got days and weeks to to do this. &gt;&gt; When do we turn? When God speaks. &gt;&gt; And the quicker you turn, the better it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you don't even know if God's going to give you the space to make the turn. &gt;&gt; Tomorrow, next week, we don't know that we have tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Now is the day of salvation. Now is the accepted time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know that you believe that. &gt;&gt; And so to turn it turn into another direction, a different direction. But in the Hebrew, it's interesting because it can be to turn. Actually, the first meaning in Hebrew is to return. That's the turn. In other words, God is speaking of of people essentially moving away from him. And that's what the book of Malachi is all about. Return or turn back. To turn is to either turn away from God. It's used in that sense to turn away from God or to turn back to God, to repent, but also to refresh and be restored. &gt;&gt; Turn back, &gt;&gt; be refreshed. You don't come back all dried up. &gt;&gt; You come back refreshed. to turn to be converted to return to the true worship of the true God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As I said a moment ago to turn it depends on what it is that you are attempting to turn. So now really the subject I need to move on another step and that is this. What is it that needs to turn and why is the turn necessary in natural life? We have here a lot of young people and a lot of children within the church and uh science will tell you that our bodies are constantly changing from day to day. From the day we're born to the day we die, our bodies change. But there's a period of time when children are changing and they begin to mature biologically and psychologically and emotionally and socially and girls start to grow into womanhood and young men begin to grow into men. And it's a transitional period from childhood to adulthood. And it's a critical time. Those of us who've gone through it, you know that it's a critical time. It's a time when young people, they they know they're not a child anymore. And they know they're not fully adult and they're they're trying to find themselves. And there's young people here that are like that. And it's don't don't think it's strange. It just happens to be part of life. But it is a corner. &gt;&gt; You're turning a corner. And I want to say that even in the natural life, that's where young people that are in good solid Christian homes need, you need to thank God. I'm going through a difficult time, but I thank God. I've got a mother and a father or a mother and a father. Either one. Sometimes you only have one. That's fine. They will stand there with you. But you need to recognize they need to guide me through. they need to help me through this time. And if you haven't, if you don't have that, then I would gra I I I would gravitate to someone else that is strong, that you admire, that can assist you because you're turning a corner. You don't want to get advice from your school friends. &gt;&gt; You don't want to get advice from the world. &gt;&gt; You don't want to get advice at the mall or at the arcade or someplace else. You want to get advice from somebody who has spiritually maneuvered that corner and come out around the other side. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It is a corner &gt;&gt; and some have gone around it and some still have to go around it and some are in the midst of the curve right now and you need to skillfully maneuver that corner. &gt;&gt; This is not one you're going to avoid. There's a curve and I'm putting a sign up right now. And some go through it very quickly and some go through it gradually and it takes a much longer period of time, but you will go through it. &gt;&gt; And there are some that are I had friends that they had grown children, but I think they were still in the corner. Never did well, I won't say it, but you know what I'm saying. In the message faith once delivered to the saints, brother Brandham says this. Now the faith that was once delivered to the saints if the body of Christ literally when it was in Jesus Christ when that spirit of God was in Christ a little while he said and the world will see me no more. You shall see me for I'll be with you to the end of the world. The works that I do shall you do also even greater than this shall you do. for I go to my father. He said, there you are. That's the faith that was once delivered to the saints. And he makes this statement. Christian friends, let's not be children any longer. He wasn't saying it because they weren't children. He was saying it because when he was speaking and he knew the message that he'd been sent, he knew what his commission was. He knew he had to take a whole &gt;&gt; and turn them back away from childhood as it were &gt;&gt; to maturity &gt;&gt; and turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers. &gt;&gt; Listen, as far as I'm concerned, the church world today is like playing fun and games. Church is not to be a place of entertainment. It's to be a place of spiritual instruction. &gt;&gt; It's a place where we are to receive from God spiritual things. &gt;&gt; And we're we're not here just to, you know, have a a a social this is not a social gathering as such. &gt;&gt; Uh it is social, but it's far beyond that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is to go much beyond that. And so he said it, "Let's not be children any longer." He said, 'We have no need of being children. We're adults. So quit running after this and running after that and joining this and join that. He said, "Come join your heart with the word of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come join your heart with the word of God. Notice what he's calling for. Come join your heart, your mind, your conscience, your resolute uh your your every part, your inner being, your soul, your appetites. Come join that with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Mature sons and daughters, they recognize the condition and the uh I will say the environment that they're in. Brother Brennham talks about the woman at the well. He said that woman in fact is I was I sat in this service in 1961. My brother-in-law, brother Brett and Anne sat in this service. My wife sat in this service. But it means more to me today than it did then. I don't recall these words. And the fact is I was sitting on the platform and brother Brandham said the woman will rise speaking of the woman at the well. She will rise in judgment and condemn this these generations. That ill-famed prostitute raised up and said, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet." I thank God for the grace of God because I was sitting there and had not fully recognized that myself. &gt;&gt; I had preached for seven years, but I had not fully realized what kind of prophet this was. I knew that brother Brandham was a prophet, but I knew nothing about Malachi 4 till a few days after this up in the mountains. He went to Malachi 4 with me. I can tell you I wasn't I wasn't gripped by this the charisma of this man. We were just there in jeans. We were just out with the horses and hunting. And as we sat there and he just went to Malachi. Didn't turn in the Bible. He just referred to Malachi. He referred to John's ministry and a ministry at the end of the age. He didn't say it's me. He never said that. He just said one that'll turn the hearts of the old fathers to the children that were born at Pentecost. And now at the end of the Gentiles comes a prophet. And I'll tell you what, I turned a corner that day. Right there. I turned a corner. Why? Because I saw it. &gt;&gt; I saw it as clear as I'm looking at you. I saw it. And it's never changed from that day to this. &gt;&gt; It's been as clear as crystal from that day to this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I thank God you need. And it says he shall turn the heart. I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I want you to listen very, very carefully. And he said, this woman, she said, I perceive that you're a prophet. We know, we're taught that the Messiah which is called the Christ, see she had to move further. The anointed one when he comes, he will do these signs, but who are you? Woman saying, we know that we know that when the Messiah has come, he will do these things, but who are you? He said, "She'll rise up, an ill-famed woman, a prostitute, and condemn this generation." Because here she stood hearing a man, saying, "But and I know you're a prophet, and I know when Messiah comes, he will do these things which he which she was seeing done. But who are you?" And Jesus said, "I'm he that speaks to you." Upon that she left her water plot and ran into the city and said to the men of the city, "Come see a man who told me what I've done. Isn't this the very Messiah?" He says, "Now, Canadian brethren and sisters, let's not be children. Let's look at the Bible. If that was the sign of Messiah yesterday, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; to both Jew and Samaritans, would it not be the same sign of Messiah to the Gentiles? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's not be children. And it takes something to move beyond childhood. We can't remain in adolescence &gt;&gt; to receive the full scope of what he's saying. It's the sign of Messiah. God sent the sign of Messiah to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; I understand this year we're going to have the largest graduating class of graduates graduating out of their 12th senior 12th grade or their senior year. and they'll be turning a corner uh a big a big corner big time and finding that you know we'll be launching straight into the work world and it's a wonderful thing to be able to graduate. It's a sense of achievement and all the rest of it but you are turning a corner and it's important that you get the right kind of counsel the right kind of direction as you turn that corner as well. But friends, spiritually speaking, and I'm moving along slowly, not because of my age. I'm moving along slowly because I want to just to get across right. We're sitting here in service this morning, but I feel and I have a great awareness that where we are in the message today, we're arriving at a graduation time. And the graduation time I'm talking about is a change of this body. &gt;&gt; And we will need some skillful maneuvering. Nothing you can do, &gt;&gt; but you need to have yourself in a place where God can do it &gt;&gt; with your heart open &gt;&gt; with your mind receptive &gt;&gt; and all obstacles out of the way. &gt;&gt; We're coming to graduation, friends. and this graduation. You don't want to flub up on. &gt;&gt; You don't want to be kind of uncertain at this time. You want to know. You want to be able to stand up and say, "I know in whom I have believed. &gt;&gt; I know the word that I believe. I know the scripture. I know where my feet are planted." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The revelation has been clear to me. &gt;&gt; Praise God. But I'm not in any I'm not in any quandry about what I believe. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a little bit of a different of a service, but if you allow me to give it to you the way it has come to me. Brother Brandham went into a psychiatric ward and he said, "When I went into the psychopathic room and there was a young lady that as he came in, this young lady said to him," she was about 20 years old and she said, "Are you brother Brandham?" And he said, "Yes, I am." And she said, "Well, would you do me first?" He said, 'Why? He says, 'You're not in the psychopathic ward. You're not here, are you?' She said, 'Yes, I'm supposed to be. He said, well, you're such a pretty young woman. Looked to be about 20 years old. Looked like she'd have made any little minister a little jewel, a little sweetheart. And I said, "Tell me your story." We're talking about turning corners. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she said, "Well, I was raised in a strict Christian home." And I would say many of us can identify with that. And one time I started again against my parents' better judgment. So I started going with a boy that packed a flask in his pocket. In case you don't know what a flask is, he packed some liquor in his pocket. And one night he persuaded me to take a drink. I'm going to talk about two corners now. And this is one she turned. It didn't take her long. It was just one evening. And he persuaded me to take a drink and said, "Finally, I had taken the one drink." And all of them was telling me that I was a wallflower if I didn't do this. I'm just a wallflower if you don't do this. &gt;&gt; So she took her drink and the first thing you know I got the habit of drinking. Now she'd been introduced to the corner by a young man and she turned the curve and when she got around the corner she found that she was headed in another direction. And now she became an alcoholic and she was a she was a she got the habit of drinking. And she said then I started public prostitution and they sent me to the good sheeperd home which is a Catholic institution and I served my time there three or four years and turned to be a Catholic. When I came out of this institution, she said, "Then I was a Catholic. I started right back to drinking and prostitution again, the law picked me up and gave me four years in the woman's penitentiary. And when I came out, it didn't do me one bit of good. I joined another church. I've joined two or three churches. And now they finally have declared me insane and said they they just watched me said I am a mental case. Why? I said you certainly don't talk like a mental case trying to find her spirit. Oh fret. What grace &gt;&gt; a lot of women were in institutions. Yeah, &gt;&gt; a lot of women &gt;&gt; were in prostitution. A lot of women were drunkards. &gt;&gt; And here's one woman of the earth that has Elijah prophet &gt;&gt; sitting with her. &gt;&gt; Amen. You certainly don't talk like a mental case. He's trying to find her spirit. And I said, now watch. Now, a young man brought her to a corner and he had a flask in his pocket and Godard turned that corner and now here's a prophet with a completely different in motive and different purpose and he's going to bring her to a corner. Watch now how he does it. And I said, "Have you ever thought of getting married and having a loving husband and little babies and all that?" Like all real mothers long or real women like to have little ones. What's he doing? He's quoting this. &gt;&gt; He's quoting this for a young woman. And she said, "And see your little girl pushing a little baby cart with a little dolly in it." Can you imagine a prophet who could be speaking to half a million people is here talking to a woman? A young woman insane institute. Wouldn't you like to be married? Wouldn't you like to have a loving husband? Wouldn't you like to have babies? Wouldn't you like to have see a little girl pushing a cart with a dolly in it? Doesn't sound profound, does it? But he's turning a corner. And she said, "Oh yes, I thought about that, Brother Brandon, but said, who would have me? What could I promise a man? Not even a home. I'm no good." And after she talked a few moments, the vision struck and I saw then where it was. And I said, "Young lady, did it ever to occur to you that all these things, these reformings and these turning of pages and so forth, we're not turning a page. Turning a page won't do it. &gt;&gt; It's got to be turning the heart. &gt;&gt; That's a different thing. and all this ritualistic routine of joining one church and another and making vows and so forth. And she said, "Yes, sir, it has." And I said, "Did you ever think that it was the devil that's making you do those things that you don't want to do?" And she said, "Mr. Brandom I've always believed that you know sometime we there are people know that what I'm doing is not correct but they they don't identify and say that's the devil &gt;&gt; and even as believers sometime we think well that's just me. No you need to identify he's your enemy &gt;&gt; and he's a devil. He want to keep you out of heaven. That's what he wants to do. He wants to keep you out of the blessings of life. &gt;&gt; Said that's the devil. She said, "I always have believed that." And she said though, he said, "Those black eyes flashed." And I said, "That's what it is, sister. You couldn't sign pledges or join churches enough if you had books as high as this building. Would never do you one bit of good. It's the devil that's driving you to those things, making you do those things." He's taking around the corner. Oh, what a curve from the life being in a mental institute. Look what she faced every day. Look at the life she faced. Look at the record that she had. And I said, "Here in your heart, you are telling me." Notice what he identifies. Here in your heart, what does the prophet messenger identify? Her heart here in your heart. drawing her full attention to her heart. You are telling me that you'd love to be married and you'd love to have a husband. And I said, "You're a beautiful girl. You'd make a sweetheart for some little tired preacher of God." And she said, "I couldn't promise a preacher, no one else, nothing in this condition, Mr. Brandom." And I said, "But I want to tell you something. Your sins may be be as black and smutty as hell, but I know that there's a fountain filled with blood, drawn from Emanuel's veins, where sinners plunge beneath that flood, lose all their guilty stains. &gt;&gt; You'll be as white as snow, he said. She said, "Oh, it seems like it just could be a myth, Mr. Brandom." She said, "I want to be that." And I said, "Will you pray with me?" She said, "Yes, sir." She turned around, knelt down at the chair where she was at, and I knelt at the other on the other side, and I said, "Now you pray." See, she could pray for herself. So I said, "You pray." And she prayed real sincerely. And I just held still, feeling if the spirit went away from her. But after a bit, she rose up and she said, "Mr. Brandom, I'm going to take your hand and make you a promise that from this day henceforth, I'll never smoke again. I'll never drink again. Or I'll never play the part of a prostitute again." And I said, "I believe, my sister, that you mean that, &gt;&gt; but it's not over yet." &gt;&gt; Nice to have somebody even tell you when you don't know. You're not around the corner yet. &gt;&gt; You haven't made it around the corner yet. &gt;&gt; You've done that so many times, but it isn't over yet. there is there's there has to be something happen. And she said, "What do you mean, Mr. Brandom?" And I said, "Kneel back down and just keep praying." And I put my hand over on her shoulder and I began to pray and I said, "Lord God, you made this woman this way. She h she is a handmade and and she could be your servant. She could be a wife to some good man. She's a beautiful woman and you can help her, Lord. And the devil has bound her and I pray thee, Lord God, make him to leave her. And she continued to pray and all of a sudden she be to change her notes in her prayer. &gt;&gt; You know, there's a different I can tell you that that is true. Yes. &gt;&gt; And some of you may be not just young people, but to many here, it may be that prayer is a bit of a strange thing or a ritualistic thing. You need to pray. You need to stay there until your language begins to change. And then you realize that that's not me anymore. That is something that is from deep within. I'm saying things that I wouldn't normally say. I'm saying phrases that are not unique to my own person. And you realize then that God has taken over in the vessel. And you're calling out out of sincerity sometimes out of desperation. You're you're you're speaking things that God is sending. And and the Holy Spirit is speaking those things. And as she began to pray, says that her her notes and her prayer had changed. In other words, she struck a home run. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe in staying there till you strike a home run. &gt;&gt; And something happened and she turned all of a sudden and looked at me with those big staring eyes like an angel then and the tears running down her cheeks. She jumped to her feet and said, "Sir, I've never felt this way in all my life." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Now it's over. Now I want to say to the congregation now she was around the corner. &gt;&gt; Oh thank God for his grace. &gt;&gt; It's a reality my brother my sister. It's a reality. And I'm not preaching this here for my health. I'm preaching this to this congregation. Some might be in the midst of a a curve right now. You might be in the midst of a curve. Perhaps not this kind of a curve. But you got to get around the curve. And you need the leadership. You need the skill of the Holy Spirit to guide you through it. And God is sending this word to you today so that you'll know that he's here &gt;&gt; and he's prepared. &gt;&gt; He knows what's around the corner. We have such a friend. &gt;&gt; We do indeed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me give you a sound of warning. You think that you can find your own way? This is not a do-it-yourself program. &gt;&gt; You cannot find your own way. You cannot guide your own life. People feel, "I'm strong enough and I know all about it." I tell you, you're headed for a wreck. &gt;&gt; You're not going to maneuver the curve. &gt;&gt; And that's where a lot of bad accidents happen is they didn't make the corner. &gt;&gt; Couldn't make the curve. &gt;&gt; And he said that's been about six years ago. She's married now and has two fine children. said she was a prostitute until that time and that time when Christ took a hold. She was a good girl until the evil took a hold. But from that time, Amen. &gt;&gt; I think that is I read that and and gave that in that kind of detail because I feel that that there's some uh striking principles that are there. I can tell you worldly friends, people that are out in the world that influence a believer, Satan has his his instruments and his tools to try to get you to turn a curve, a bad one, in a wrong direction. &gt;&gt; I thank God for people that are concerned. I thank God for the body of Christ. I thank God for godly people. I thank God for the messenger. &gt;&gt; I thank God for godly families. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And your influence. And I say stand strong &gt;&gt; and be a powerful influence where you are. You don't know. You know this. When you read what brother Brandham said to this woman, it doesn't sound like it was a lot of profound counseling, but it was the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; the way he did things. Amen. Now, Brother Brandham says this. We're building a building. I'm taking a little different direction now. I want you to remain real attentive for a few more moments. &gt;&gt; We're building a building, not a wall. &gt;&gt; The builders want to take a Now, here here he is. This is later in the ministry. And the message was, "Who do you say this is?" That's what he asked the disciples. And that was the that was the critical point with the woman at the well, who she thought he was. And it's still just as important today. &gt;&gt; Who do you think this is? &gt;&gt; Who is it that has done for you whatever has taken place in your life? Who is it that did it? Say, "Well, I go to Cloverdale Bible Way. If Cloverdale Bible Way did it, it's not it. &gt;&gt; You haven't gone around the corner. &gt;&gt; Church can't do it. Friends can't do it. Family can't do it. Parents can't do it. That's all wonderful. That might be part of it, but that's not it. I could say what Brother Vanom said. You're not around yet. It's not over yet. &gt;&gt; If you've had a life up and down and up and down and in and out and in and out, I'm saved today. I'm lost tomorrow. All the rest of it, you haven't. You're not around the corner yet. But we're here to help you around that corner. &gt;&gt; I want to do business for God today. &gt;&gt; Is this congregation with me? &gt;&gt; We want to do business for God. &gt;&gt; He said, "The builders want to take a line of blocks and just go straight down." Why? Because, and this is what he's talking about. He's talking people that were in all kinds of denominations and they set their set the direction they're going and they just keep going in a straight line. He says, "We're not building a wall. We're not we're not establishing a denomination just going on and on and on forever. That's not what we're doing. That won't build the building of God." He was telling them they understood what he was saying. We're not building a wall. We're building because actually the denominations became a bunch of walls. We're not building a wall. &gt;&gt; And the walls had separated the people. We're not building them. He wanted those walls to come down. &gt;&gt; We're not building a wall. We're building a building. &gt;&gt; And so he said, he said, "Now any builder can build that, but it takes a real master mechanic to turn a corner." He says, 'When you get to cut the corner, some are here in the construction industry, and I can tell you that you just build a straight wall that's that's relatively simple, but when you want to start turning corners or perhaps more complex corners and the other thing, corners are expensive. They you count more corners in a building or in a house, it that's where there's expense associated with that. And I can tell you that the temple of God is not something that's just been thrown together. It's been masterfully designed and put together. And he said, "We're building a we're building a building." He says, "When you get a to when you got to cut the corner, that's a time it shows whether you're really a stonemason or not. When you can turn the corner with it and keep the continuity of the rest of the building. when you can turn a corner and keep the continuity. That's that's one of the most marvelous things of this message is that it has continuity. You can find it and anchor it in Genesis and in Exodus and Leviticus and Deuteronomy and Joshua and Judges all the way through to Revelation. You can anchor it because it had continuity with the rest of the building. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And now it's on these corners is when the trouble comes, and the builders want to keep building on down, but we're not building a wall, but a building." Ephesians, Paul says in Ephesians, "In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit." And if he Paul says further in Hebrews and I just want to launch from here for the next short while to the end of the service. He said wherefore Hebrews 3:1 Wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession Jesus Christ who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house. I want you to just catch that. as Moses was faithful in all his house. Now, Paul is not talking about Moses' children and his wife. &gt;&gt; He's talking about his ministry to the people that God used him to call out. He says he's faithful to all of his house. And then he goes on to say, "For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, in as much as he who builded the house hath more honor than the house. For every house is builded by some man, but he that built all things is God." &gt;&gt; Moses is attributed to having built the house. But Paul is saying God, it's God that builds all things. &gt;&gt; Now hold on to it. And Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after. So what Moses did was to be spoken. It was something that uh reflected or showed what would come after. That's what Paul is saying here. But Christ as a son over his own house whose house we are. You are &gt;&gt; the house of Christ. &gt;&gt; And and he says whose house we are if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. And Jesus said in Matthew which we know so very very well, I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Now God gave an example here said that Moses was faithful in all of his house. But here's one now. He said it's greater than Moses and greater than the house because he's the builder of the house and we are his house. You're the temple of the Holy Spirit when the construction of the tabernacle. And now I'm going to turn bit of a corner. You want to think real deep. I want to go back to the tabernacle when it was finished. And as the construction of the tabernacle which Paul said here now is a type an example when it was completed and all the sacred things were put in their specific place. They were placed in their certain order. It was Moses that was ordained of God to set the things in order. turning the corner for Israel from not even having a tabernacle to having a place where God said, and I hope you can catch the importance of this. This was a major corner for Israel. They had no place that was a a a central focus place like the tabernacle. The tabernacle, friends, is not just a structure. A tabernacle was a place. Have them build me a sanctuary so I can be among them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, what would you think if if I was able to say here, God of heaven appeared to me uh yesterday and told me that we as a congregation are to do such and such and such and such and you had that kind of confidence in what I would say and I wouldn't tell you a lie and say we're to do a certain thing. God says because I want to come down amongst you. I want to be there and I want to dwell with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is going to cost us some effort, cost us some money, cost us some time. There'd be at least I would say perhaps the most of you would have confidence enough to say we believe what brother Ed has said and we're going to go ahead and do that. Well, the people had to believe in Moses and and and now this was turning a major corner because God is saying you build this tabernacle. you build a sanctuary and I'm going to dwell there with the people. I'm going to be there with them. &gt;&gt; And so they begin to assemble the whole thing and and you'll find that all through Exodus. And now they come to the end of of Exodus. And if you have your Bible still handy, would you please turn to Exodus the 40th chapter. I'll give you a moment. as we read this. Now, listen. Don't read ahead of me, please. We're going to start right at the very first. And as we read this, I want you to think of the text and the whole title of the service. He shall turn. He shall not might, not hope to, not if, he shall. Let me tell you something, friends. To me, this is such an absolute. For every elected seed of God that is truly elected of God, there is no way but what their heart was going to be turned by this message in the messenger. &gt;&gt; He has been called and ordained of God to turn the heart from wherever you were and whatever you were in. If you are an elected of God, that message is going to turn you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, "On the first day of the month shalt thou set up the tabernacle." You'll do this, Moses of the 10 of the congregation. Verse three, "And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the veil." Moses. Now, as we're reading, I'm going to make comments. Moses, you there's two million people there. Now, Moses perhaps physically didn't do it all. But the word, this this corner that this people was turning from being without a tabernacle to having a tabernacle, without having a place where God would be, without having a mercy seat, to having a mercy seat, that's a big corner. to having a place where the pillar of fire would be to not having one. That was a big corner. &gt;&gt; And Moses and there was no one else. There wasn't another person within the two million people. That was the only one. And thou shalt do it and you shall set it up &gt;&gt; and you shall bring the ark. In other words, you'll bring the word in there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This prophet's going to bring the word in there. Not another soul could do it. He was the one-man ministry that was going to bring it in there. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; And you will cover the ark with the veil. And I can't hardly hold this, but in this day, another prophet was sent and says, "You shall uncover it. &gt;&gt; You shall unveil the word. You shall take the veil away. You shall take the mystery of God out of it, and you'll make it clear to the people, and you shall turn their heart." [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and thou shalt bring in the table and set in order the things that are to be set upon it. Verse five, and thou shalt set the altar of gold and the incense before the ark of the testimony. Verse six, and thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering. In verse 7, and thou shalt set the labor between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and down to verse 12, please. And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. He shall he shall establish the ministry. In other words, he will establish. There's another order for the ministry. This was the sole responsibility of this prophet of God who was the messenger to them at that time. There was no one else that could do it. You shall bring them in. You shall set them in order. You shall wash them with water. Verse 13. And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments. You're going to clothe him. And you're going to anoint him and sanctify him that he may be a minister unto me in the priest's office. Without that, Aaron could not do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And thou shalt, verse 14, and thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats, and thou shalt anoint them. Verse 15, as thou did anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office, for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations." And thus did Moses according to all that the Lord commanded him. So did he. And he took he took and put the testimony into the ark. He put the testimony. He put the word of God into the ark and set the staves on the ark and put the mercy seat upon it. Now notice verse 21. And he brought the ark. He brought the ark into the tabernacle and set up the veil of the covering and covered the ark of the testimony as the Lord had commanded him. And he put the table in the tent of the congregation upon the side of the tabernacle north without the veil. And he reared up the court around about the tabernacle and the altar and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work. &gt;&gt; Can I say Moses turned the corner? &gt;&gt; Moses led Israel and turned the corner. And this whole chapter is just a summation of all that was taking place through wrote we can say, "Oh, I I heard this message today and I heard that message and another message, etc." Let me say to you as a congregation, it all it's all summarized in these few words. I'll send you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn the heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He shall when you read a message that is part of the turning to turn people from their darkness to turn people out of their confusion. &gt;&gt; And people might say, well, I I don't agree with one man. That's beside the point. And you have a you have your dispute with God Almighty. It's God who said in chapter 3 of of Malachi, I'll send I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way. Who would ever stand up and say John the Baptist didn't fulfill it? He did indeed. &gt;&gt; And that's the that's the danger of the people today and happy to look back and say, "Oh yeah, he did it, but I don't believe it happened in my time. I believe I can tell you it already happened to your time." And people that don't believe that are too late. You're too late. You've already lost it. You're already in already going straight down the line without turning the corner. &gt;&gt; Elijah turned the corner. &gt;&gt; A major corner. This structure may look like a church building. We may have microphones and music and music and singers and and a congregation and and take tithes and offerings and have missions and all the rest of it. It may appear have the same outward appearance as Israel had the same appearance as being another nation. But they weren't another nation. They weren't just another nation. &gt;&gt; They had a leader, yes, but their leader was not like the other leaders. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I hope hope I'm able to get this across to you. &gt;&gt; This message is not the same. It may have the appearance you've got a group of people, you got a church, you got ministers, and whatever more. It is not the same as any other. &gt;&gt; And no wise can be the same. Why? Because the one that God has sent, we are here as a product of a certain phrase of scripture. He shall turn the heart of the children back to the fathers. &gt;&gt; And we are now a people that he has turned back. And we can say he the messenger of the day. He gave the order of the church. &gt;&gt; He set the table where it's supposed to be. He set the candlestick where it's supposed to be. He put the deacons where they're supposed to be. He put the Sunday school teachers where they're supposed to be. He did these things. &gt;&gt; How? By the message. By the word that came out of the mouth. &gt;&gt; You think we put too much importance on a man? Tell God that. &gt;&gt; Tell God he shouldn't have sent Moses. Tell God he shouldn't have had Samuel. Tell God he shouldn't have had Isaiah. Tell God he shouldn't have had Jeremiah. Those were one man ministries. God's always done that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And look where all our uh uh uh shall we say gathering or accumulation of leadership worth taking. Where's the United where's the ecumenical council taking the world? &gt;&gt; No place. &gt;&gt; It's going to the slaughter. This messenger said &gt;&gt; take him to a slaughter. &gt;&gt; You think they believe that? Not for a second. And if you're here and you doubt that, then shame on you. Here's come a vindicated messenger. Yes. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, that no one else but but God himself and and Christ was the builder. That's why the pillar of fire. As soon as Moses was done this, you have to help me now so I can finish cuz now I got to the place where I can finally preach. &gt;&gt; When Moses finally got got the thing finished and the Bible says then &gt;&gt; then the cloud covered Moses Moses didn't say cloud now come. &gt;&gt; God was waiting till Moses was done. Hallelujah. And he put the table where it's supposed to be. He put the shoeb bread where it's supposed to be. He put the candlestick where it's supposed to be. He hung the curtains. He put the veil there. He brought the ark in. He brought the word in and placed it in the ark. He put the mercy seat on there. He put everything in its place. And when that was all done, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then God &gt;&gt; came and covered it with a cloud and a pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when this messenger come in and people out of the congregation came and stood before before him, he was just a man. He was like me. He was like you and perhaps a woman who was standing in front of them like any woman here. They're standing there. Now what? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's the people. Here's the congregation. They've got the music. They got everything in its place. It looks like any other group. &gt;&gt; Looks like any other evangelist. Looks like any other ministry. But now what happened? I tell you that's when the pillar of fire came down. That's when the secret of the heart was revealed. Those people knew that there was another presence that this was not. And I can tell you that that it was that presence that has brought this word. That presence has sanctioned this message. &gt;&gt; And if you think it just this is just another gathering of another group of people because it looks like another church, you're so far off the base, friends. You're not even near it. Not even in the same court that I'm in today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Then the cloud covered the tent of the congregation in the glory of the Lord. People say, "Come amongst us. Come amongst the people." And they see the children. They see the sisters. They see it's not just the appearance of the dress. There's a holiness. &gt;&gt; There's a godliness. There's an aura. There's an atmosphere. And the people sense it. They they know something within themselves that this is different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what you need to be able to say is glory to God. It's different because an Elijah messenger came and turned a corner. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I have turned a corner. Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you a Christian? I am that but more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm a Christian that has a prophet messenger. &gt;&gt; And that sets you apart from a good many others. &gt;&gt; That's not a boast, friends. That's a praise and a glory. &gt;&gt; What we're saying is, oh God, who sent Malachi, you sent the messenger of Malachi. &gt;&gt; Turn the heart. Oh, the heart that is so deceitful. The heart that can be so hard. The Bible says that Jesus, he walked into a He walked in the synagogue and this is I'm going to close. He walked in the synagogue. You talk about how hard how hard a heart can get. &gt;&gt; Religious. &gt;&gt; You couldn't even put your finger on these men. &gt;&gt; They live such godly lives. Were they nice? Absolutely. have nice families. Absolutely flawless. You couldn't put your finger on them. And Jesus walked in the synagogue and he sees a man there with a withered hand. He says, "Tell me, is it lawful if you have your animal has fallen a ditch, is it lawful to set him free on the Sabbath day? and they held their peace. And Jesus, the Bible says he was angered &gt;&gt; at the hardness of their heart that they could stand there, sit there and see this man bound that withered hand. And he said to the man, "Stretch forth your hand. Stretch forth his hand." And they took up, they wanted to find out how they could destroy him. &gt;&gt; Why? Because of a hard heart. I'll tell you what, friends. I know that within this congregation and within my ministry that I've seen people I've seen men come from dark places where they fought and they had murder in their heart and all the rest of it and God rich in mercy got a hold of their heart. And some of you, you know where you were in such dark places, but God rich in mercy. What am I talking about? But I'm not talking about just a man setting things in a certain order, but I'm talking now about a a a supernatural that comes in in attendance with the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, how thankful I don't have to we don't have to go back just to some some books and say, "Well, this is uh you know, this is what I was taught in the seminary or this was what you were taught." I'm not I'm not having to depend on that today. I can put my back up against the wall of the revealed word of God and say, "My God, he came down in his glory." Even then, even even brother Brandham, I was looking at it and and I was going to bring it to you today. He stood and stood before the people. I can read it to you. And he said, "Now I will show you the glory of God." Brought the people before him. Now, do you like to see the glory of God? I will say my brother, my sister, we have been privileged to see the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; From one day, from one week to the next, the supernatural hand of God is upon the people. &gt;&gt; I am not putting my confidence in the fact that God does supernatural things. I put my confidence in the fact that God opens blinded eyes to see what the word of God states. &gt;&gt; You can be prayed for and be healed and be wonderfully healed at this moment and you go out and maybe not even live for God. But one thing for sure, if God reveals himself to you, that's why you want to say from the depth of your heart, Lord, I have a corner to turn. I have a spiritual corner to turn. I have I've been a church member. I've come here to church, but I need to turn a corner where this is real to me. Maybe you're at the place where brother Brandon would say to you, you need to get down one more time. You think it's over. You think it's over because you say, I I'm going to promise I'm going to live that way. I'm going to do it. But when you go out, the strength's not there. &gt;&gt; Why? You need to get around the corner. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is it complicated? No. Oh, how simple it is. You just get down and pray until the note &gt;&gt; in your prayer changes. &gt;&gt; You say something has happened. &gt;&gt; You can stand up and say, "Brother Ed, something happened." I say, "Yes, something happened." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I didn't intend on saying this, but one day I was praying with a young man. He was a good church member. He played in the orchestra of another church not far from where we were. And I walked up to him after a meeting. Brother Barup was in that meeting. And the Holy Spirit came on brother Barup and he be to cry out glories to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; You heard Baroo say that. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's enough to scare the liver out of some unbeliever. &gt;&gt; And I walked up to this young fellow His name is Ken Ardal. I said, "Do you think it's for you?" He was choked up. He said, "I think it is." I said, "Why don't we pray?" He was startled. He said, "Right here." They didn't do that in his church. I said, "Yeah, right here." So he got down and he took a hold of the rungs of the side of the chair and I began to pray. There was no movement. I felt absolutely nothing. I felt like this here. There was no emotion. There was no nothing. And I was kneeling and I looked up and I said, 'Lord, within myself, I said, 'Lord, is that all there is to it? Is that all you're going to do? Is there nothing more? And had my hand on the middle of his back? And I felt I felt his back pulsating. And I looked down and his knuckles were white as he was trying to hang on to the sides of the chair and they started sliding down. He was trying he was almost resisting it, but he couldn't. He couldn't. The Holy Spirit was overpowering him until his chest was flat on the chair. And he sobbed out his life and his unbelief to God. And when he got up, he was a changed. &gt;&gt; He turned the corner that moment. And he was around the corner from that day on. I tell you friends, God is real. &gt;&gt; And that's the God I believe in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm glad to invite you to this quad. &gt;&gt; I'm glad to introduce him to you if you don't know him. And he'll take you around the corner. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer. Oh Lord Jesus, the same yesterday, today, and forever. You are here present, not in a great emotional drama, but you're here to come to the hungering heart. You're here to come to the thirsty one. You're here to make the transformation by the power of transformation. Oh, Holy Spirit, I declare that you are the one that has brought this word. You're the one that has attested to and the validity of it. You have attested to it, Lord. You have proven it. You have vindicated it. and all who will come and all who will believe shall be the beneficiary of the full power of it. Oh God, there may be some that need to go around the corner today. There may be some that need to make the full full uh measure of their decision. Oh God, I pray that it will not just be uh some an another action or another attempt. It's not an attempt. It's a finished work. And Lord, I'm declaring it by the power of the Holy Spirit and by the power of your word. I pray that even now the Holy Spirit will go out and hover over the congregation brood upon them. And I pray, dear Lord, the hungering and the thirsting will indeed have even now uh a a a reaction to the moving of the Holy Spirit. and that there will be a voice audible in their mouth saying, "Lord Jesus, even now I believe with all my heart and I believe the word that you have sent and I'm prepared, oh God, to follow you every step. Take me around my corner. In the name of Jesus Christ, I trust you as my guide." Amen and amen. I wonder if we could stand. I'd like to sing I have a friend. We have a we have a friend who I don't want you to get lost in the in the words of the song. You can sing with your eyes closed if you will. If you don't know it, you can look at the screen and have it. [Music] I'm going to pray for this congregation. For those in the congregation, I want the congregation to pray with me. You prayer warriors out there, you pray with me now. I preach this message because God wants to do something within the lives of people here in the congregation. Some have struggled for a long time. Would you believe with me so that struggle can be done? &gt;&gt; Would you believe with me &gt;&gt; so the struggle can be finished and over? &gt;&gt; And we want to say it over, friends. We want to say it over. And if it was even just for one person, I'd say, "Oh, God, we've had this whole service. I've done my studying. I've done my praying. I've done my preaching. That a struggle could be over for one." [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a friend [Music] beside me. You hold my hand and Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh, [Music] he to me. He knows the way. He knows the way. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Oh my. [Music] [Music] We're going to say that last chorus once again, that last verse. But I'm today I'm here, but I'm not in church as such. I'm here sitting across the table from you. I'm saying from heart to heart. If you're in the midst of some not just some spiritual walk or some struggle, we all have that. But if you are in a critical corner in your life and you haven't made that, you haven't been able to get around that curve yet. And maybe you're like the young lady in the institution. She'd tried so many times. Maybe you've joined this church. That won't do it. She joined one church and another church, another church, but she had to have somebody who knew who knew the one with power. &gt;&gt; She had to have someone. And maybe you need someone to pray with you. And you haven't had that. I would invite you to come. You can stand right here. You can kneel whatever you wish. And there's godly brethren here, ministers will come and pray with you. But you mean business with God. You absolutely mean business that that's what you want to do. [Music] friends, if we don't if we don't make the curve. Believe me, I've seen a lot of wrecks. I've seen a lot of wrecks. They're not pleasant. There's always sadness attached to it. And what's really sad is if you don't need to, you don't need to wreck up. There's people here that'll pray with you. You come and it's not me. It's not the one prays with you. It's the one we represent that is here on your behalf. We'll sing it once again. And then we invite you if you care to come. [Music] He knows the way my path is. He can see around. I [Music] did. [Music] Oh, whatever. Brother Tom [Music] my [Music] brother Lance is here. Brother Lance [Music] He is. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a friend. Oh, what a friend. You are beside me. Yeah. He to me. He knows the way. He knows the way. My is he my [Music] take me afraid he afraid. No one afraid beside me to hold my hand and save me. I he knows the way. He knows the way. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.

[Applause] [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Applause] [Music] Let's just thank him, shall we? Thank you, Lord. Your sins are forgiven. Oh, they're forgiven. The forgiven people, the Exodus people. We thank you, Lord. We give you praise and glory. No one else could redeem us. No one else could take us out of the fire of sin. No one else could change our mind. No one else could take us the darkness from us. Oh God, such grace and such mercy. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. We bless your name. We bless your name. We bless your name oh God. We bless your name. Oh, we bless your name, oh God. We give you glory. We give you praise. Oh magnificent one for all the victories passed and the great things you have done. We bless your name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Bless your name. Bless your name. [Music] He never will. Yeah. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Applause] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. That's [Music] [Applause] [Music] heat. How about that verse in prisons chain? Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Heat [Applause] [Music] up here. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. [Applause] Yeah. Heat. [Music] I just &gt;&gt; That second verse says at some midnight hour, it might not be a midnight might be a Sunday morning. Hallelujah. But the same one that could meet us at midnight. And the same one that was in the prison with Paul and Silas, not another one. That very one is here. That very one that went with the prophet messenger that spoke through his mouth and told the secrets of their heart and has turned our hearts back. How we rejoice, oh God, we've been turned back by that one. And that one is none other than Lord Jesus Christ. He's the builder of the house. But he had to have his messenger to do it. And tonight, this morning now, not a midnight hour, but this morning, we're giving praise to him. And I I can say if you're still in prison here, you can get out. You can get out. Hallelujah. Walk out. Let's give him praise. Some midnight. [Music] [Applause] Oh, heat, heat. Yeah. Heat. [Applause] Yeah. Heat. [Music] [Music] We're going to dismiss you but not from his presence carry this with you. Why did he send? Why did God Almighty send such a message and such a messenger, such a prophet in this end time with the utterance of what we call a message out of his mouth? Why did he do that? To counteract, to defeat and destroy the power of every spirit that Satan would bring upon this age. &gt;&gt; And I don't care what spirit it is. I don't care what temptation it is. The power and presence of the Lord Jesus Christ that's here now is greater than that today, tomorrow, next week, until the rapture. Do you believe that? I believe it with all my heart and soul. Heavenly Father, this congregation of people, assembly of hearts and souls, believing with all that is in them in the word that you have sent. We believe this grand old Bible revealed. We believe the seals have been opened and that the mysteries have been made known. Lord, we believe, oh God, all that you have spoken through your messenger. And now as the people have heard the service this morning, I pray that you'll bless each one abundantly. And as we depart this place and prepare to come this evening, Lord, as our brother Lance has waited upon you. And oh God, how blessed we are as this servant of God comes and and lays open the word of God. I pray that you'll anoint the service mightily, Lord. And even now, may we begin where we're leaving off just now. and carry on as we fellowship this afternoon. I ask that the fellowship will be sweet, that it'll be around the word, and may your presence be with each one in Jesus Christ's name. Keep us safe on the highways. Protect us. We pray Jesus Christ's name. Amen. We're thanking the Lord for sparing our brother Shawn and uh Kaye. Am I saying it right? Just last night is struck by a motorcycle. And were there two on the bike? Two on the bike. One lost his life. Not we don't know. just right in the city just making a simple turn shot right out of the street. The motorcycle body flying right over top of the vehicle. And uh we're we're thanking God that we haven't got some people in the hospital seriously hurt. We're thanking God we're not announcing that someone's life has been taken. We're thanking God for his grace. I tell you what, we got somebody watching over us, friends, and we give him praise and thanksgiving for that. You tell Brother Sean we're rejoicing. Amen. God bless you. Drive safely. Drive carefully. Have some refreshment. Come back early and be prepared for the word. You're dismissed in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music]
