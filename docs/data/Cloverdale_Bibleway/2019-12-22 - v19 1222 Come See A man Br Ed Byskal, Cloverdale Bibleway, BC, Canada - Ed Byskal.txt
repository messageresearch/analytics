We'll give him all the glory. We'll give him all the glory. We'll give him all the glory. Christ [Music] the Lord. Merry Christmas. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sure we're allowed to say that now. We're politically correct. &gt;&gt; Made sure the prophet said it. We He said it. I can say it. So, merry Christmas &gt;&gt; to the elected lady here in Cloverdale Bible Way and all those that have joined with us this morning. We wanted to indeed give him all the glory, honor, and praise. So, I have a couple announcements to make and uh I'll just try and do it uh succinctly and then let the uh brother Mark Ao and family get ready to sing their special. Please, if you can make yourself ready. Um you know, we've started at the end of the year with a couple of announcements. We had, of course, we had Rosie and Anthony announcing their engagement and sooncoming wedding. Then we had Jasmine and and Caleb announcing and now we have another announcement to make. So you can see that the whole uh something's happening this year. So um brother Danny and sister Melinda parents up there. They're they're going to announce the wedding of their daughter, Sister Danny Lynn and brother Alex. They're standing up there. Why don't you stand up? There they are. God bless you. If you ever get a chance to have them over and and uh uh and try and encourage them, they don't really need your encouragement, but they will encourage you. I said, you are uh your testimony has been like that of sister uh Linda and brother Ken. actually uh our sister led brother Alex to the Lord and he's been here for a few years and been baptized and identified with this message. I said that's the way to get your husband, get him saved and then marry him. So, God bless you and maybe a blessed time in the future. Um we'd like to make an announcement regarding the watch night service. Brother Ben Hoffman, Sister Linda Ardal will be those that will be uh making themselves available for the musician part. If you've got a song, we'd like to we have such a diversity of nationalities and cultures within the church and families of course and we love to we love to see the families and you all the different groups come up on on New Year's Eve. It is really a time of victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're still standing in Christ. We love the word. We love his people. &gt;&gt; And we're looking for a blessed blessed time. And um trustees wanted me to announce coming to the end of the year, those that would love to uh give extra donations, you need to have that in by the 31st coming into the new year. And um that is their part. And we also like to announce again, Brother Ron Spencer will be our first guest speaker kicking off the the year. It'll be January the 3rd and the 5th. He'll be speaking the Friday night and both services on Sunday. And been I've been in contact with brother Ron. He might be listening this morning. I said we're going to ring you out like a lemon. Amen. We're going to start the year with the anointing of God and the word of God. And I I believe we're going to have a a blessed time. &gt;&gt; Amen. And one last thing before, if you don't mind, I'll just make one last announcement. I have a great Christmas present this morning. Brother Edwards will be speaking. &gt;&gt; Brother Briscoll called me up and asked me, "So, Tom, you think it would be all right?" I said, "All right." I said, "Brother Ed, take them all. We love you." And I I love that last message Brother Brem preached. I think brother John alluded to it on Wednesday night which was a tremendous service. But God's gifts always and I love that word always find their place. So God gave us at Cloverdale Bible Way a tremendous gift in the man of God. And I want to give God the re I want to recognize that to him this morning. How thankful we are for this love gift that you've given us as many years. May God anoint him and may you have a wonderful Christmas. We love you all. God bless you. [Music] [Music] Over the skies of Bethlehem appeared a star. The angels came to lonely shepherds.

[Music] The sun could not compare to the glory of your love. There is no shadow in your presence. No mortal man would dare to stand before your throne, before the holy word of heaven.

Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me. Let it start and live inside this house of clay and mold it every day. Oh, let your word be born. Bless you. [Music] Amen. Well, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Wonderful day, &gt;&gt; wonderful season, and a wonderful time that we're in. I've heard the uh announcements that have been made, and we're not quite done. So, we have one more. uh, Brother Gary and Sister Lisa St. John of Lynen, Washington. Uh, and Brother Jesse and Tracy Lovevel of Phoenix, Arizona. They wish to and are happy to announce the engagement of their children and a hope St. John of London and Jeremiah, that's a wonderful name, Miles Levelvel uh of Phoenix. And they are announcing their engagement. [Music] And wedding plans are in the making. That's always good. When they're in the making, that makes them flexible. We're happy for them and happy for the families and happy for the believers that they are believers and that's the main thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Well, I wanted to uh speak to you this morning and I'm happy for each one that is here. God bless you. It's wonderful to see you and it's wonderful to have this opportunity. And the reason why I say it's wonderful is because I want to say some things today that probably I may not say otherwise and thank you for being here. I appreciate your presence, appreciate what has been said and appreciate each one of you. Uh, I just want to make a couple of remarks before we read the scripture. And I'm going to have brother John Andes read the scripture for me. Uh, Brother Brandham often referred to the woman at the well. This is also one of the scriptures. I want you to really pay attention to this. This is also one of the scriptures which we have in John 4 and we're going to read. But this is one of the scriptures that the angel of the Lord referred him to when he was entering into the second pole of his ministry and revealing the secrets of the hearts of the people. And the ministers ministers told him it's of the devil. And uh the people people had a difficult time and I had a difficult time speaking about this because that was the very thing that anchored my heart because I thought no man can do this. &gt;&gt; This has to be from another place. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I was just uh a teenager as some of you are. I was 14 when I first saw that and and I heard a man from Vancouver actually who was Ern Baxter and he was pastoring a church downtown. He became brother Brham's first manager. And I heard him at the platform saying before brother Brandham came out and he said, "Now, Brother Brandham will not begin to preach. We'll not begin to pray for the sick until the angel of the Lord is here at the platform." And I that just smoked my heart. I thought I have heard about angels. I have had Sunday school teachers refer to us out of the scripture about angels, but I have never seen a man that spoke to an angel and I want to hear him. And brother Brandham came out and began to pray for the sake. And that is the night or the day I saw a blind girl healed. And I never forgot that. It is remarkable how his ministry unfolds the makeup of our human being, our body, our spirit, and our soul. Now, I won't let you get out of this building today without pricking your heart with a a phrase that you've heard him say many, many times. Now, I'm I want to take every spirit in this building under my control. And when he said that, I thought that has to that statement has to come from another place. Who has the control of every spirit of every person in a building? &gt;&gt; How does a man stand there and be able to say that unless God will come in, move behind him and allow that to take place? And that is why also he would tell the people don't move around, don't be, you know what he's saying is don't be irreverent. And so today I want to take uh my time and I want to engage some others to help in the service. And I would ask you to be as reverent and uh as respectful as you possibly can. Now, uh, I'm going to read and you can take your Bibles, please, and we'll turn to the book of John. I have some slides and I will have some audio as well. Now, I'll forewarn you ahead of time. The slides have to do with included in the slides are uh audio portions that I was seated here probably no further than where John or Tom is. brother Tom from me and uh my mind was filled with questions because the scriptures had not been revealed open to me concerning baptism and concerning Godhead and concerning the serpent seed. Now, do you have any questions? And brother Brandham said when the people came up, he said, "Now I just want to talk to the woman or I want to talk to the man, sir, and contact your spirit." That was him. Now, the scripture, the Bible you're holding says he's the same yesterday. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm going to take some from the woman in the well. That was yesterday. And today, I was sitting on the platform 2,000 years. That sounds like a long time. That's not very long for God, a person that's eternal. &gt;&gt; That's no there are there's no yesterday. &gt;&gt; There's no tomorrow. And there's no today. It's all the same time. It's and I can tell you and I am speaking from being a witness of that. And then I stood where brother Tom is when he was contacting the spirits of some people that I knew and he would tell them what was going to take place. And some of you young men, well, you've heard me tell the story of the soldier boy. Now, you're going to hear brother Brandham cry out to him in the service. And the next day, I met him. The next day, it was all fulfilled. &gt;&gt; And I just felt that I would fail you if I didn't do this. And so I'm going to give you that as a gift and there'll be no Christmas like this. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, the prophet of God came and one of his first services was God in his people. That's God in &gt;&gt; you. You may not feel very worthy. You may not feel as though that is the case. But that happens to be the absolute truth. &gt;&gt; And you have to recognize that because if you don't recognize it, that doesn't stop it, &gt;&gt; but it will prevent God from using it the way he would like to. And so I'm going to be speaking to you at a service that I have held in my heart now for some weeks. And uh so I pray that you will be attentive. I know you will. And may this be a service that you will remember all your days. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's my prayer. Brother John, would you come and and read, please? We're starting at John the 4th chapter and verse is it five? Verse five. and John will be reading and I will I I like the way that he reads the scripture and we're reading it very slowly and very with emphasis. Okay, brother John &gt;&gt; John 4 verse 5. Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Saikar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, &gt;&gt; I'd like you to notice Jesus who is going to say to this woman later on, I am he. Yes. &gt;&gt; Is he weary? He's weary. &gt;&gt; He's tired. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's thirsty. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So continue. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well, and it was about the sixth hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith unto her, "Give me to drink." For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat. &gt;&gt; I wonder if you could put slide six up. Uh slide one rather. Slide one. And if you read verses nine and 10, we'll read it together and you can look it if you don't have your Bible. Verse N. Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou being a Jew, askketh drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. That is uh difficulty number one. How is it that you are speaking to me that Jews have no dealing with the Samaritans? And here's a young Jewish man in his 30s perhaps uh who is tired is obviously wearied by his journey and he's thirsty and he's asked for a drink of water from this woman. Now she has some hurdles to overcome. How is it that you a asking me Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans? That's a real problem. &gt;&gt; Jesus answered and said unto her, if thou kneest the gift of God, &gt;&gt; if thou kneest the gift of God. Now, he's going to unveil a gift to her. And I have chosen this time to unveil that gift to you. And who it is that saith to thee, give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The woman saith unto him, "Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with." &gt;&gt; Problem number three, &gt;&gt; and the well is deep. Problem number four, &gt;&gt; from whence then hast thou that living water? &gt;&gt; Number five, &gt;&gt; art thou greater than our father Jacob? &gt;&gt; Number six, &gt;&gt; who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle. Jesus answered and said unto her, "Whosoever drinkketh of this water shall thirst again, &gt;&gt; but whosoever drinkketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst." &gt;&gt; But the water that I shall give him shall be in him, a well of water springing up into everlasting life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, there is a satisfying portion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's even a portion where you will not return to have somebody some I know we're having a special speaker, our brother Ron Spencer. Uh, and that's wonderful. But remember that you can be inspired and you can be oh so caught up. Oh, you think I'll never be the same, but you have to come back and get another drink. &gt;&gt; But I can tell you that there is water &gt;&gt; that where you will never thirst again. &gt;&gt; Never thirst again. &gt;&gt; God can do something in your life &gt;&gt; that will be so permanent, &gt;&gt; so powerful, &gt;&gt; it will answer your questions. And I have some things to ask you and remember during this service while brother John is reading. I wonder if he is here. &gt;&gt; I wonder if he is trying to catch your spirit &gt;&gt; and reveal himself to you. &gt;&gt; That will be the greatest gift &gt;&gt; I could give you. We'll continue to read &gt;&gt; verse 15. The woman saith unto him, "Sir, give me this water that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw." Jesus saith unto her, "Go, call thy husband, and come hither." The woman answered and said, "I have no husband." Jesus answered said unto her, "Thou hast well said, I have no husband, for thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband. In that, sayest thou, truly." The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. Our fathers worshiped in this mountain. And ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. Jesus saith unto her,"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem worship the Father. Ye worship, ye know not what. We know what we worship. For salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; For the Father seeketh such to worship him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit &gt;&gt; and in truth. &gt;&gt; The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh, which is called Christ, when he has come, he will tell us all things. &gt;&gt; I'd like you to notice now this. He will tell me, tell us all things. Yes, &gt;&gt; please notice that. &gt;&gt; And brother and and the prophet of God brings out this. She he said she knew one thing. I know the Samaritans know. I know when the Messiah cometh, he will tell us all things. And and the Lord Jesus opened his mouth and told her one thing. It only needs to tell you one thing. &gt;&gt; And you feel as though your whole life has been exposed. &gt;&gt; And she said, "Come see a man." &gt;&gt; That's my message. Come see a man. &gt;&gt; That told me all things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "I don't know you." That's William Brandham. I don't know you, but there's one here that knows us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he knows everything about us. He knows all of our troubles, our difficulties, our trials, &gt;&gt; our burdens, and the things that are throw our lives into such a chaos sometimes. And we come and you've come now to this service and I want that you'll receive something. &gt;&gt; Carry on, please. &gt;&gt; Verse 26. Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. And upon upon this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said, What seekest thou? Or, why talkst thou with her? The woman then left her water pot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, Come see a man which told me all things that ever I did. Is not this the Christ? &gt;&gt; That's the question. &gt;&gt; And now this morning. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And now today. &gt;&gt; Yes. Not back then. This same Christ, &gt;&gt; this is what this prophet of God and this what the ministry here and brother John spoke on Wednesday night. If you haven't heard it, you need to go home and stream that service. Wonderful service. &gt;&gt; God is in his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the greatest gift that we can give you. Amen. &gt;&gt; The greatest gift. You may not care for the wrapping. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's a different wrapping. He's given each child that's been born into the world a different wrapping. &gt;&gt; And so you have your own wrapping. And maybe it's not appealing to everyone, but nevertheless, that's the wrapping. God has wrapped you up with a certain nature, a certain character. &gt;&gt; And uh and now I want to say to you, this man was dressed as a Jew. Come see a man. &gt;&gt; He's dressed as a Jew. a man wearied and thirsty. He doesn't look impressive. He doesn't look like some dynamic preacher. He was more than a prophet. &gt;&gt; He was the Messiah. &gt;&gt; A man wearied, thirsty with his journey. A man speaking to a woman of a diverse culture. Right? &gt;&gt; And actually the Jews considered them of a lower base culture. &gt;&gt; And so that is why when his disciples returned, they wouldn't ask him anything about why do you speak to this woman? And not only that, she was ill-famed. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; she was one that you may not wish to have as a neighbor. She had had five husbands &gt;&gt; and been unsuccessful with five husbands. &gt;&gt; Unsuccessful. Not a very successful person. And the one she's with now is not her husband. &gt;&gt; Not a very impressive &gt;&gt; no sir. &gt;&gt; Record. But the Messiah met her and answered all of her questions in a moment of time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's the gift God and his people. Thank you, brother John. Thank you. That is why she said, "How is it?" I'll let you sit down in just a moment. How is it that you being a Jew ask a drink of me? That's a simple thing. She had the bucket. She could give him the water. She could give him a drink. Why didn't she just give him a drink and call it quits? &gt;&gt; She could have done that. You could do you can do things that are spiritual and acceptable to your neighbor, to your wife, to your husband, to your children, or the young people, to their parents, but is it what he really is troubling your spirit about? And that's what I want to ask. Is he trying to contact your spirit today? &gt;&gt; It's given to me to stand here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I feel very humbled over that to think that a man, a father, a mother, a young person can have this God in them. &gt;&gt; Are we worthy? probably not, &gt;&gt; but we'll pray. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; how I thank you for your children. How I thank you for your servants who have given themselves to you unreservedly. Lord, I do not know where you want to go today, but I am asking that the Messiah that sat on the well and spoke to a woman of Samaria will be here and speak to people from Washington, Idaho. We'll speak to people from London and Blaine and Cloverdale and Langley. &gt;&gt; We need you. &gt;&gt; Oh, we need you. &gt;&gt; We don't want to just gather in a church building. &gt;&gt; We'd sooner just meet you out in the wilderness someplace. Come and do what you would be pleased with. I ask it in your name Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Jesus answered her and said, "If thou kneest, if you knew the gift of God, a lot of people are going to be giving and a lot of people are going to be receiving and maybe have some gifts given." And I can tell you before you even tear the wrapping, it may be important and it may not be important. One thing for sure, it won't change your life. But I am going to offer you according to this book. I'm going to offer you a God that knows you &gt;&gt; inside out. And he knows the things that's troubled you all of your life perhaps or for maybe many many years. And maybe you even asked why have you allowed this? Why did you allow this? I'll tell you what you need. You need this gift and it'll answer it in a moment. And I'm going to tell you about you're looking at a man that was filled with huge questions. I was telling the brothers in the back. I saw a group of ministers and I was one of them. And they gathered around a woman that was very oppressed. She was very cast down and she had a heavy spirit with her and I don't know what the problem was even to this day. I don't know what it was, but she was physically in some state. And the ministers around her cast started casting out spirits and they cast out devils. And I didn't know they cast out every devil I even knew ever knew of. And nothing seemed to happen. And when they were all done and done their praying and exercised in prayer, they all went to their seats. I was still standing right here. And a woman, she's a widow, and her husband was a great teacher of the scriptures. And uh she took up to sending his books out, and her name was Eaton. And this was in a little tent. And she stood in front of this woman. The woman was right here at the pulpit standing. And she stood in front of her and she began to quote the scripture. That was all she knew. She quoted one after the other after the other. And I saw her get happy as she quoted the scriptures. That's all she had. And she quoted the scriptures and she began to giggle. and she'd quote another one and laugh. And the woman in front of her, I saw her face change. I saw her I saw the transformation take place and soon she entered into she began to smile with the lady and and she giggled a little bit also. And that woman was completely delivered &gt;&gt; listening to the scriptures &gt;&gt; being quoted to her by another woman and all the ministers you know ministers uh eloquent ministers maybe powerful preachers I don't know and I was standing there with them but I knew that something was missing &gt;&gt; that woman is to be delivered and I'm going to tell you now the God &gt;&gt; that is present. &gt;&gt; You must receive that. &gt;&gt; But that God is present to to be active in your life and to give you what you have need of. And you need to be able to say, "I know &gt;&gt; when the Messiah cometh, &gt;&gt; he will tell us all things." And you're looking at a man, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; that was in that same state. But I knew one thing that what this prophet of God, it was another era. I just knew I had never heard anything like that before. And I had questions on the scripture. And please hear me out. There was one that knew what those questions were &gt;&gt; and he answered those questions. If thou kneest, if you know, if you behold, if you perceive, you've asked maybe many times, you've asked down in your deepest self. And uh you'll excuse me when I When the woman said, "How is it that thou being a jou a Jew, how is it that you being a message believer, how is it that you have these things that are seemingly beyond answer and yet they should not be a part of your life, part of the oppression And I'm not speaking defeatism, but that does happen. And uh thank you for your attention. She was not, and this is the key, she was not completely open with everything. You know, we are capable in this day and in this age of, you know, we've cultivated ourselves to such a place. We go to church and we have we have the answers to so many things and and we do. But we become a a word which is koi. C O Y. We become koi and that is we become incapable of coming to a very sensitive part of our life. We uh so he said, "How is it that thou being a Jew askest of me which am a Samaritan?" That was a big question in her mind. And then now I'm going to give you a great secret that I have found in throughout my life and that's this that you can bring people and when you contact or start to contact their spirit they're willing and open to speak to you about spiritual things but they don't come right to the problem. And brother Brandham said he he said this he said the Samaritan woman was willing to speak about what the Jews and Samaritans now I'm sorry that's not the exact quote but nevertheless the woman was willing to speak about what was the Jews and Samaritans what they believed believed and where they worshiped etc. She said how is it that the the she said I know that the Jews worship in Jerusalem and she turns religious right away and is willing to speak and is able to speak of those things. I know the Jews say we should worship here and we Samaritans say they should worship in this mountain. I don't know where where where is the place that you really worship. And Jesus said if you knew the gift of God and who it is that is speaking to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what I want to say to you today. If you knew the gift of God, what is the gift of God? A prophet. God sends Elijah the prophet to let you know that God is not He says he says these words, "God's in the universe. Do you believe it?" The people believe it. &gt;&gt; He said God's in his son. Do you believe it? Yes, we believe that God's in his people. &gt;&gt; Well, if you as long as you don't mean me. Because if you only knew my flaws, &gt;&gt; he knows their He knows that. He knows those flaws. &gt;&gt; He knows all about it. &gt;&gt; Before you even came on the scene, he chose &gt;&gt; to be recognized in you and with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know uh we become so efficient at covering it up and not really coming to the subject and that was her case. So he said what she was not able to do go and get your husband. He was contacting her spirit right then. Go and get her husband. Well, she said, "I I have no husband." And Jesus said, "You've spoken the truth. You've had five." Her eyes flashed. I'm sure. What? What kind of man is this? You've had five, but the one you have now is not your husband. in that you've spoken the truth. She says, "I know that when the Messiah comes, he'll tell us all things." She achd for that moment. I that speak to thee am he. &gt;&gt; You know, you know the God of this word. You know the God of this Bible is God in his word. Yes, you believe it. Yes. Is God in his son? Yes. Because that's way in the past sometime. But is God in his people? &gt;&gt; That's the question. Is that God right here? Is that God who can contact somehow we put that off and put it out there? some place where we don't have to deal with it. Don't do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bring it right here. God, in this service, &gt;&gt; God, in this tabernacle, this sanctuary, God, you've heard my confessions. You've heard my worship. You've heard me say things. You've heard me say I love you and I'm sorry. Maybe I didn't say it with a surrendered life that I should have that I want to have. And I am going to I wonder if you'd play an audio part. Yes, that'll be fine. Please. Now, as this is being played, your brother at is standing here was on the platform. I perhaps had more questions than you have because I was bewildered and in a dilemma when I was just standing just where Thomas seated. I may have been seated. I don't remember. But I was there and I heard this. I was there. So would you please play it? &gt;&gt; Just break that little bed of blackness there and watch the Holy Spirit fall on this building and every person in here be healed. Will you believe it? &gt;&gt; Stand up on your feet and accept it then in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Raise up your hands now to him. Say, "I believe you, Lord. I love him. I love you. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm broken because I was there. &gt;&gt; Oh, your heart. Just raise your hands high and praise him. Say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus." &gt;&gt; What's the matter, soldier boy? You're not going to commit suicide. &gt;&gt; The devil's lying to you, boy. You've only got a phobia. He's lying to you. He'll drive insane if you believe. Deny, renounce the devil. I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to renounce the devil and accept Jesus Christ as your healer. You'll go back and be a gentleman and a real real man. Do you do that? Raise up your hands to God and say, "Praise God." That's right. Oh, amen. I go back for me. Be well. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Said, "You'll go back." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And be a real gentleman and be a real man. On the way back, they passed us and I stopped in a town. It was a little mud town called Fort Nelson, 300 miles from where this was song was being sung and I was on the platform listening to this. How strange. Sure. &gt;&gt; How strange it was to have somebody in the middle of a course. I love him. &gt;&gt; I love him. It was a normal service to me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because he first What's the matter, soldier boy? That was different. &gt;&gt; That was a service like I didn't I couldn't predict. You'll not commit suicide, soldier boy. Everyone started looking for the soldier boy. That's not the point. You'll not commit suicide, soldier boy. That's the devil talking to you. The next day they passed us. And when we had gotten to Fort Nelson, I said to Brother Brandham, I said, "You know, it's about 2:00. By the time we get to Southwick's, Sister uh Southwick will be done the dishes and so on. Maybe we should have something to eat right now." He said, "I think that'll be a good I think that would be a good idea, Brother Eddie." So, we just pulled off the highway onto a little side road, potholes, rough gravel, and we're jostling up and park the car. And we go in, and there's Chris Berg, Brother Brandham, and myself. And uh in the door comes we had just ordered our soup and the waitress had gone and uh the door opened. It was just over here. The door opened little aluminum door and in walked two men. The one man I hadn't seen before and the tall young man I had seen, he was probably six foot, probably your size, brother Carrie and his eyes were quite his face was drawn and he this man little heavier set man uh crowded by him and came around in front of brother Brandham and thrust his hand down. He says, "Brother Brandham," he says, "so you remember calling out the soldier boy?" And he put his hand up and he was kind of shaking. He said, he looked at me. He said, "Do you do you remember, brother Eddie?" I said, "Yes. You said you'll not commit suicide, soldier boy. That's the devil talking to you." He said, "That's it. That's what you said. That's what you said." And uh he said, "This is him. Would you pray for him?" He said, "Uh, I brought him down from Fairbanks to be in your meeting so that you could pray for him, but I couldn't get him in the healing line." And so, just then, the waitress came and slid our soup. In fact, as I can tell you, it was pea soup. And she slid it in front of us and uh just went on her way. And brother Brandham said, "Uh, well, maybe we'll just have our soup." I thought, "Have our soup?" You know, here's a boy is trying to commit suicide. three times commit suicide in the last year and we got our soup and we're not going to pray for him. I thought that was one of the awakening things I had. If God's going to do something, a bowl of soup doesn't make any difference. So, we uh they said, "Well, we're going to have a bite to eat, too." So they went down a few booths and sat down and uh brother Brandham he said now I saw he he had changed. He was burdened again. Now it it was not just uh to go out in the mountains and hunt. You know the people at home maybe thought that but here he's always exposed to the burdens of the people and he he said uh I think there was a woman yesterday he said in the healing line and uh she's blind. I said, "Uh, I can't remember her." Because they had the ministers all lined up and just laying their hands on the sick. I said, "I can't remember any blind woman." Yeah. Brother Berg said, "I think there was a blind woman uh in the healing line." And brother Brham said, "He's just listening, but he's not paying much attention." He said, "Just a moment." And he looked just over my head and looked like he was looking into eternity or someplace and he said, "Yes." He said, "It's uh let's see." And he's looking, he's watching something. He said, "Yes, she's a young German woman." And uh let's see. Oh, he said, "I see now she has given up her place in the prayer line to lead the blind woman through." He looked at me and said, "That's right." And then I just listened. I knew now that he was off someplace else. And he said, "Yes, she's a young German woman." He looked at he kind of shook his head and looked at me and we're eating soup. I can tell you soup doesn't stop God. &gt;&gt; I can tell you this meeting doesn't stop God. &gt;&gt; The fact we've got microphones and speakers, etc., and you're set again. That doesn't stop God. &gt;&gt; The question is, is God coming near to you to contact your spirit? If he is, then he has some answer for you. &gt;&gt; You can make contact with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Yes." Just a young German woman. He looked at me. He said, "You see, brother Eddie," he said, "she may be praying just now." I, Brother John, Brother Tom, I was completely bewildered. She could be praying right now. We're up in the wilderness someplace. How are we going to know she's praying? He said, "She has perhaps some things that she was she's in need." And he just listened for a few moments and looked said, "Yes, she's a young German woman. Starts all over again." And her name, he said, "I'll ask him. I'll ask him. Come see a man." Yes, &gt;&gt; I'll ask him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he'll give me her name. And he was just silent a moment and he said, "Yes, her name is Sister Fear." He said, "We would say fair." She's a young German woman. Her name is Sister Fair. And he shook his head just a moment. He said, "You see, she could be praying just now. I thought, what kind of a what kind of an experience is this? &gt;&gt; What kind of a preacher is this? &gt;&gt; Who will know that she's praying just now? Praying for what? And she had had no idea that 300 miles of the Alaskan Highway, 300 miles, 500 miles from where she is praying. And I got in touch with my father, my dad, who lived in Dawson Creek, about 200 miles from her. I said, "Can you find Sister Far?" I said, "This is what happened." And he said, "She lives down in a certain town, I think White Court, something like that. And she was praying. I don't know what she was praying or what she was saying, but here was a prophet of God, and that was what I was introduced to." Now friends, the soldier boy, we had already left of Fort Nelson. We're driving up and and we have a second portion. I just want to a second audio portion. Could we play that, please? The second one, &gt;&gt; the woman's moving back from &gt;&gt; the lady is suffering with a tremendous nervous condition. &gt;&gt; He's talking to a woman. &gt;&gt; Spiritual problems that bother her. &gt;&gt; Her name is Sister Clint. K L the truth. Raise up your hand. &gt;&gt; A good friend of my family. She's standing just in front of me. &gt;&gt; Last time I said you guessed that, Brother Brandham. Let me talk to her a little more. She's a fine person and the anointing's on her. Let me just say this to you. I don't know the woman. Never spoke to her till just now. But that woman is aware that something's on her right now. A real sweet holy feeling. If that's right, raise up your hand, lady. Now, she's the Canadian here with you. See, I'm looking right at it. That it isn't a glare. It's a glow. amber light right around the you say how do you see it and I don't well it's another dimension how did Paul see that pillar of fire down there and damper with him didn't see it &gt;&gt; how the wise man see the star that led him to Jesus and no observatory ever reported it mystic star in the sky for two years nobody saw it but the wise man because they were the only ones looking for it &gt;&gt; I don't know what I told you the only way I know is on I hate them. But whatever it said was right. Now, let's just see again. Yes. Nervous. Your trouble comes mainly about this time of day, late in the evening, when you're really fatigued, wore out, have real funny, weary feelings come on you. That is right. You get nervous once in a while and drop things. Not long ago, you were standing near a window when a sun was going down. You feel real nervous rubbing your hand. That's the truth. How would I know where you were standing? How would I know you did that? Before you come to the meeting, you prayed to God that you'd get a prayer card. You were very happy when you received it. That's thus sayaeth the Lord. That's true. Here's another thing. God tells me that on your heart, you're praying for somebody else. &gt;&gt; That's a friend that's a dying. It's got cancer. They don't live here. They live in Fort St. John. And the person's shadow with a dark shadow. That person is a sinner dying with cancer. Thus sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are those things true? Raise up your hand now. Is there a shadow of doubt in your mind? Is he Jesus Christ? Is God among his people? &gt;&gt; Do you believe, sister? Take that same handkerchief with you. Lay it on the person and don't doubt. Jesus Christ will make him well. Don't believe. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it all? &gt;&gt; I was in the car. We were driving past Fort St. John and the first exit into the and I read in his obituary, this man's obituary last night. You know what obituary is? That's read at the funeral. Now, here he is calling him out. And then he's talking now to a woman that I know is a very close friend of ours. went to our church when they were in Dawson Creek and they were in Fort lived in Fort St. John. Now we're just coming to through Fort St. John on the Alaskan Highway. The prophet of God has no idea where we're taking him. He just knows that we're driving and he's actually driving and I'm sitting beside him in the passenger side. And there was a big old white house uh up probably 150 meters up this access road and it was the first road into the town. They moved the town because the US Army built the highway wherever they wished it to go and they made it as straight as they could right at that point. And I often wondered about this big old white house. never did know and that this man who Sister Clint was praying for lived in that house. And while we drove, he slowed right back down because it was about a 30 mph uh zone and brother Brandham is driving and he said, "There was a woman praying for a man. I believe it was from Fort St. John." And I said, I wanted him to know. Oh, I know her. She's a good friend of our family and well acquainted with us. I knew her very very well. And now she was standing in front of this prophet of God and he was telling her and another thing. Now he said someone might have said I guessed that but another thing you've been praying for. He said, "Another thing, God tells me that on your heart, you're praying for someone else. That's a friend that's dying that's got cancer. They don't live here because we were in Dawson Creek." He said they live in Fort St. John and we're in Fort St. John. And the person is shadowed with a dark shadow. That person is a sinner dying with cancer. That's thus sayaeth the Lord. And while we drive by slowly, he has to put his hand and he puts it behind my head. And he said, "The man's in that house." When I got to to to brother Southwick's place, I'm anxious to tell him what a prophet is. So I'm saying, you know, Fort St. John, I said, you know, that big white house. I said, we're just going by it. And brother Brandham put swings his hand out and and because of the movement of the car, he puts it behind my head and he said, "The man's in that house." Brother Southwick says, "Well, I know that's Ed Thomas. I know him." He said, "He and I know he's dying with cancer." I said, "Well, you know, Sister Clint, she was praying for him and standing on the on the platform and here I am sitting just a few feet away and I see her and I'm listening to every word. Now you're listening to me. &gt;&gt; Are you listening to every word? &gt;&gt; This happened." Amen. &gt;&gt; A man that I'm introducing to you was telling this prophet of God and speaking through his mouth and telling him, "She's praying for a man. He's a sinner man. He's dying with cancer. He died two months later or three months later. He died in July." uh according to the internet, he died in July and uh uh he and and his wife wrote a great obituary about him and told where they were living. And I found and just read it this last week where he was living and when they moved to that place and when he built that house and raised his family in that house. Listen friends, this isn't some play game. &gt;&gt; This is God, a living God. You have been called by a living God. &gt;&gt; He knows every detail of your life. He knows your burdens right now. He's contacting your spirit to let you know that he's alive and he's ready to deal with every situation. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Yes, we do. &gt;&gt; You think that he may be unaware and somehow maybe because you can speak of religious things. Oh, I I go to Bible way and what does that mean? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It it doesn't mean anything. What it really means is that there's a God &gt;&gt; in this world. He chose to come here to this world and through Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; who is the God man. &gt;&gt; And this is something that I have great difficulty but I'm going to try to explain it to you. That was the man. He went to the cross as a man but it was God in Christ reconciling the world to himself. He was making a way. &gt;&gt; He was being your uh uh propitiation. Uh he was being your sacrifice. You needed a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; You're hell bound. &gt;&gt; Without God, without the sacrifice, you're hell bound. There's no way for you to be saved. But but through him &gt;&gt; and he gave himself &gt;&gt; freely to you. &gt;&gt; Freely no questions asked. &gt;&gt; He didn't ask this woman to tell about her life. What about your first husband? What about your second? What about the third? What about the fourth? What about the fifth? He didn't. Now the Messiah was there &gt;&gt; to deal with that thing &gt;&gt; and she said, "Come see a man. and that's what I'm saying to you. &gt;&gt; Come see a man, &gt;&gt; not a man, &gt;&gt; not not William Brandham, not brother Ed Biscoll, but come and see a man that knows every detail. It's none other than the living God. &gt;&gt; And he chose to come in the form of this message. This message only relates I had all kinds of questions about it and uh this man a man that God had under his control. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A prophet of God. And you may have a question about that right now. When did when was that prophet under complete control of the Holy Spirit? I can tell you a friend, when he uttered those words, that was God speaking. &gt;&gt; God spoke to my wife whose daddy was hanging between life and death. I flew her up. I flew her up. The man that's standing behind this pulpit flew the sister that's sitting back there listening to me. And she could only look at her father for 10 minutes of a day and that was it. And could not utter a word. Couldn't say anything to him. His heart might stop. His main artery had ruptured and but had not burst but had ruptured but it was on the verge of bursting. And if he did, he'd just expire. and she's standing there and I called a doctor, Dr. O'Brien in Dawson Creek and I said, "Uh, should I fly my wife up?" "Yeah." I said, "I think you better." So, I flew her up. But we have three daughters that are all here this morning, and she's mother to them. And brother Brandham was in Victoria and he had meetings there. You have it on tape. Three in Grand Prairie. I'm sorry. Three in Grand Prairie. Yes. And three in Dawson Creek. But the year before, the next year, we had three in uh Portal Bernie and three in Victoria. And she was holding this in her heart all the time. I don't know who was there. I was there. But my wife wrote the ads for the newspaper and was playing. There were two Pentecostal churches that I had attended both and one hosted brother Brandham in Saskatoon in 1947 and they would not cooperate with this meeting. It's hard to say, but it's true. And I called the pent main Pentecostal church and invited them to be in the meeting. He said, "Well, we have a camp." So I said, "Well, that's fine." So he excused himself. And so that was three churches invited. We just have this service starting. My I think my wife or sister Opel McGriff's at the piano. I'm on the platform and Brother Brandham is going to come out shortly and a woman comes up and she said she's from Christ Church Cathedral in Victoria. That's the church the queen goes to. You talk about a stuffy church. That's a stuffy church. Anglican church. She came up and she said, "You need somebody playing the piano. You need somebody at the organ." We're I think we're singing Only Believe or something. And she sat and began to play the organ. And she was the woman that played the organ for those meetings. Somebody &gt;&gt; who claimed to be a real Christian really missed out. &gt;&gt; They had an opportunity. &gt;&gt; And here God's prophet who is uttering and speaking to people who I knew and they're missing it. And this woman comes up. When I say they are, they had been invited to play and partake of those beatings. And they did. Friends, God is in his people. &gt;&gt; And when you shake hands with somebody today, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if you're here in this service, Yes, sir. Make yourself accessible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Make yourself visible and make yourself available &gt;&gt; to God's people. &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, nice to see you. Thank you for being here. &gt;&gt; I trust this will be a blessing to you. said, "What was Brother Brenham's ministry?" His ministry was this, and I'm going to do it like he did it. God is in the universe. Said, "Do you believe it?" The people said, "Amen." He said, "God is in his word." &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? He said God is in his son. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; And he says God is in his people. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; And that's what we are called here to believe. &gt;&gt; God, this God &gt;&gt; is in his people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I wonder if he's maybe touching your heart, touching your spirit, not touching your emotions, but touching your spirit. And maybe you've had very very deep questions. Yeah, we can talk about spiritual things. We can talk about the church. We can talk about well, I worship here. Will you worship there? That's not the question. You see me here in this service, but we had to give up everything. I had people call me and cancel meetings because now I was tainted with William Brham's name. But I can tell you and I tell you by a declaration. I wouldn't trade any of those brothers testimony for the testimony of this message which I've received it. You talk about it it answering all of your questions. I said I had three questions and and people hear about that. When those three questions were answered, my whole life was exposed. &gt;&gt; Whole life. The whole life. &gt;&gt; There's something about it. There's something about God's word. &gt;&gt; There's something about it. And I don't want you to get lost in the terminology of God's word, but there's something about the scriptures. There's something about a certain light that comes from another place. &gt;&gt; It's a divine light. &gt;&gt; And it may be that halo. I don't know. I couldn't care less. I don't know what kind of light it is. I don't know where it came from. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; All I know is a a light &gt;&gt; is shed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And explodes in your heart and all questions people asked me and they were irreverent. And one man asked me, he was a minister. I think he was certainly religious. And he said to me, he didn't even have the respect to say, "Brother Brandham." He said, "What attracted you to Brandham's ministry?" That's what he said. I said, "Well, every time he spoke, this book became alive." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that your testimony? Then I'm with friends. Every time he spoke, this book became alive. &gt;&gt; I said it didn't take much intelligence to determine whoever is the author of this book was speaking through those lips. &gt;&gt; And that's what attracted me &gt;&gt; when he opened his mouth. when when all of that happened up in Fort Nelson &gt;&gt; and we were driving on a rough uh road, access road, I just said, I just stepped out of the Bible. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; I've just stepped out of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've just stepped out of the pages of the Bible. That's what has drawn me to this. And the fact that people come or people go, that's up to them what they do. I can tell you one thing. It's a living thing. It's a living testimony. I thought of you, Brother Milco, and and the people in uh in Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslavia, and all the supernatural things that took place. That's this man. &gt;&gt; Come see a man. people disregarded him and fell and we don't want to even talk about that. But we had a Pentecostal minister. He wanted to print this message. But he had other things in his mind &gt;&gt; and he stood right beside the printing press at 30 37 to 38 years old and dropped dead &gt;&gt; right there printing this message. Those things are not easy to get. His wife remained a believer for years. Those were things that we experienced. Friends, you talk about writing a book. We could write a volume of a book. But God has People are not sitting here because of their health. They're not sitting here because I don't have another church to go to. They're sitting here because something has gripped them. &gt;&gt; Something somebody &gt;&gt; has gripped them. &gt;&gt; And all I can say to you, come and see a man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I introduce you to a man. &gt;&gt; The same man the woman talked to. How is it that thou being a Jew? How is it that you being a Christian? How is it that you've been engaged are here to hear this? It's not even a sermon as such. But how is it maybe you could speak about things and handle yourself and maneuver things around and talk about the message or talk about but you know there's something missing yet. You know there's something missing. This man that I introduce you to is the one where an honest prophet of God &gt;&gt; would say, "I don't believe I've known you. I don't know you." He said, "I see you've been prayed for before." uh said, "Yes, a man that's kind of got thinning his hair." He's prayed, "You've been prayed for in a big meeting before." He said, "Why? It's me." He said, "It's me." When he sees it refocused, I suppose in the vision, he said, "It's me. You were in a meeting of mine and I prayed for you before." And uh she said, "That's right. I like that kind of honesty." &gt;&gt; Listen friends, you have been introduced &gt;&gt; to a Christ. &gt;&gt; He knows everything about tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows everything about the rest of your life. He knows every person. He knows every detail. And not only that, he knows it, but he's got it in control. &gt;&gt; Absolutely has it in control. &gt;&gt; Would you stand with me and I'm going to pray. Lord, I'm going to ask you to come by come by our way. Come by the people's way. &gt;&gt; Come by these that are standing here. &gt;&gt; And I have given witness &gt;&gt; of the things that you have done. &gt;&gt; You're the living God. &gt;&gt; It's a true testimony. &gt;&gt; It's a true work. &gt;&gt; You're here, oh father, &gt;&gt; bless your holy &gt;&gt; living in your people. living in your servants. &gt;&gt; Help us &gt;&gt; to receive as we ought to receive. &gt;&gt; Help us, Father. &gt;&gt; There are people here that I &gt;&gt; dearly love. Oh God, &gt;&gt; and this congregation is full of people. Father, may they know and may they feel. Oh, God. &gt;&gt; I bring them to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I offer them to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This is the wrapping &gt;&gt; you have given, oh God. &gt;&gt; Yes. It's been crinkled by a lot of things in life. &gt;&gt; Yes. But you are real. And I want to say you are more precious. &gt;&gt; I want to say with a man that you used mightily, he was humble enough to say, "Brother Eddie, the next time you're talking to him, tell him." and you feel his presence close, come close to you, tell him that brother Bill loves him very much. And tonight, Lord, today I want to say to you before these people, we love you &gt;&gt; very much &gt;&gt; for all that you have done and all you will continue to do. Jesus, I want to present these people to you. &gt;&gt; And the only gift we have is whatever you have given. &gt;&gt; Bless them I pray. Bless them I pray in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Would you allow me just to pray a prayer although we've just prayed brother Brandham said and I was so touched by this if you don't mind he said shall we bow our heads just a moment Ed for prayer. Our heavenly father, as we come into thy presence now, dedicating ourselves and this building and all that's in here for your service. That's what I want to say. &gt;&gt; Yes. realizing that this may be the last time that some here will ever hear the gospel or be privileged to be in a church anymore. And this may prove the eternal destination of their being. So help us, Father, tonight to be very reverent, to be very loyal to the gospel and to the call that thou hast called us unto this world. And I thank thee, Father, tonight for the privilege that I have to stand before this audience of people. I've often thought how I would I cherish in my hands a charger that held the drop a drop of the blood of thy son. But I realize tonight I hold greater &gt;&gt; in this estimation. Before me is a purchase of the blood that he gave his blood that these might become his. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you see why I'm exercised is because of that? And I'm coming to a close now. So may thy spirit direct every word. &gt;&gt; And how we thank and how we thank for the grace of God. to know that one time we were aliens cut off from God &gt;&gt; without mercy without hope. &gt;&gt; Christ died for us &gt;&gt; in ourstead bearing our reproach and sins in his own body and knowing someday that he shall come. We do not know uh we do not know what we shall be like but we know we shall have a body like his for we shall be like him. Amen. Amen. God bless you my precious friends &gt;&gt; this season. Thank you Sister Athena for being here. God bless you, Brother Nathan's mom, Sister Charity's mom from Idaho. Thank you for being here and thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak to you. Come see a man. I hope you'll remember. It may not be. It may not be today, but it could be that he'll come to you in a very personal way. And I pray that he will. I pray that you'll experience some of these things. Don't Don't get weary. Don't give up. Don't do that. You pursue it. And he'll he'll meet you. The man at the well, he'll meet you. I say it in faith. I say it in confidence. &gt;&gt; He'll meet you. He didn't bring you this far. &gt;&gt; He didn't bring you to hear this message unless he intended to take you all the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I look over this. I know that some of you have experienced troublesome times. I know that. I know that you have reached almost like the end of yourself. That's fine. That's good. But you'll never reach the end of himself. &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what to do and how to do it. He knows exactly how to touch you, how to reach and I think of I I read it so many times, but I read it again and again. I put it he said he I'm trying to reach your spirit. I'm trying to contact your spirit. And I said, "Oh God, let these people that sit there and listen to these words, let them know that someone &gt;&gt; so much greater." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Will contact their spirit. &gt;&gt; Friends, you can have all the Christmas you want, &gt;&gt; but give me one moment in his presence. That's much greater than anything else. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Brother Tom, I feel like the presence has been open. Amen. And we're not like brother Bham talked about that idiot that was caught up with the wrapping paper, but we're caught up in the God that was in the wrapping. Let's stand to our feet. Let's let's just sing beautiful Christ. Beautiful Christ. Well yeah we can say let me exalt exalt the beauty of Christ fairer than all his [Music] wonderful marvelous beautiful [Music] oh that the world might see. [Music] Beautiful Christ.

Praises forever I in beautiful cry. Beautiful cry [Music] of my life. [Music] Beautiful cry. Beautiful cry. My ever glory. I wondered this Christmas whether you can come and say, "Come see a man. Come see a man that's told me all things." How many of us could lift up our own hearts before God and say, "I met that man. I met that man." It's not just a story of 2,000 years ago, but this Jesus that has come down in our day has come to meet me and I love him. So, I think it'd be fitting to to close this little meeting off with I love him. I love him. I love him. [Music] I love you. [Music] and [Music] just sal [Music] tree. Let's bow our heads a word of prayer. [Music] We heard your word this morning, Lord, and it spoke deeply into our hearts. [Music] How often have we read John 4 at the woman at the well? How many times your prophet used that scripture to identify even his ministry and the people missed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They missed seeing the Christ in the vessel. &gt;&gt; You said the world will see me no more, but you shall see me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For I'll be with you, even in you to the end of the world. This great unveiling of Christ is now Lord being resident within the flesh of your children Jesus Christ living in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May this Christmas season we unwrap our lives before those that love us that they could look within to love you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us live this life. Not just speak about it, but Lord, live it and love it. Love a message that has come to elevate you in all your glory. Lord, I pray that you'll be with each and every one from the youngest to the oldest. May this be such a different Christmas that not caught up in the frivolous things of life, but let us come get caught up so that we might be carried away with the blessed lover of our souls. Would you bless this church, Lord? Bless this group of people for they are the church, the sons and the daughters of God that have witnessed this declaration of come see a man and we've seen you high and lifted up in all your glory. Bless your children as they are with their loved ones maybe unsaved. May God they be drawn to the God wrapped within their lives. Use us for the kingdom. Lord, there's just maybe this could be our last Christmas, our last time, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To proclaim the glory of God. And wise men are still seeking the word made flesh. Guide us every step of the way. Lord, let this star lead us in the days that lay ahead. Bless your children now. We pray in Jesus holy name. Amen. Amen. Well, can we just sing one last song? &gt;&gt; Can we sing one last song? &gt;&gt; One last song. Oh, beautiful star of Bethlehem. This star that God used today to guide us to his word. Beautiful star of Bethlehem shining upon [Music] and guiding the wise around their way unto the place where Jesus lay. Beautiful star that let shine on. Beautiful star of Bethlehem, shining on us from the glory dawn. Give us the light to light our way to the land of perfect day. Beautiful star that land shine our first rain. Beautiful smile, the whole of rest for the redeemed, the good and blessed. Yonder in glory when the crown is one. Jesus now that star brighter and brighter. Beautiful star just shine on. Beautiful star of Bethlehem. Shine on us with glory dawn. Give us a light to light our way to the land of perfectly. Beautiful star. Shine on. Shine on. God bless you. Greet one another.
