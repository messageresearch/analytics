[13:55] this morning.
[13:58] Brother Dave Chabernoff, if you'd
[13:59] [music] come,
[14:02] there's several requests that we want to
[14:03] pray over, but you've got to reach out
[14:06] and touch the Lord
[14:08] right where you're at.
[14:12] many needs in the congregation [music]
[14:13] this morning.
[14:17] But I believe that God has a heart. God
[14:20] has a mind for you, for this [music]
[14:24] body, for this service this morning, for
[14:26] our pastor.
[14:29] So we want to come under one mind,
[14:33] one heart, [music] one accord.
[14:36] We want to remember
[14:45] the straws family. Their daughter's in
[14:48] very serious condition in an accident
[14:52] down in Oregon. She's in ICU. We want to
[14:54] remember her this morning. [music]
[14:57] Unspoken requests we want to lift before
[14:59] the Lord this morning.
[15:02] We just want God to move in our midst.
[15:06] How many have a need upon [music] your
[15:08] heart? You just say, "Lord, with my
[15:11] burden lifted up before you would to
[15:13] [music] come and meet me this morning as
[15:15] we pray." Brother Dave, God bless you.
[15:21] Let's pray seats.
[15:26] Our precious heavenly father, Lord,
[15:29] we bow our heads to you, Lord, in one
[15:31] mind, one accord this morning. Father,
[15:34] the church of the living God has
[15:36] gathered in this building, [music] Lord,
[15:38] and we've come, Lord, to worship our

[16:06] fables, Lord Jesus. But we're following
[16:09] the revealed word of the hour, Lord.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; This is the ark, Lord. [music] This is
[16:14] the ark for this hour, Father. And we've

[17:02] see the supernatural, Lord. We want to
[17:05] see lives changed. [music]
[17:07] We want to see lame bodies healed, Lord.

[17:50] divine presence, including the requests.
[17:53] We we bind our hearts for these serious
[17:56] needs. We just say that by your stripes,

[26:53] all alone,
[26:56] praise [music and singing] his name.
[26:59] When you feel you can go on, [music]
[27:03] just raise [singing] your hands and say,
[27:07] "Great [music]
[27:08] [singing] is he
[27:11] that is within me." And you can praise
[27:14] [music and singing] the way.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; [music]
[27:25] &gt;&gt; If you just praise his [singing] name.
[27:35] [music and singing]
[27:42] &gt;&gt; [music]

[28:25] [music]
[28:26] [singing]
[28:32] &gt;&gt; Gater [music]
[28:33] [singing]
[28:34] is he
[28:36] that is within me. [music]
[28:39] And you can praise the heard away.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; If [music] you'll [singing] just praise
[28:53] his name.

[29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Sister Yola, Sister
[29:11] Esther. God bless you. Maybe Linda, if
[29:14] you could just start playing. Lord, I

[29:18] want to have a couple announcements this
[29:20] morning. Nice to see the church full.
[29:22] Nice to see the sons come home.

[29:28] that spot's been empty too long.
[29:31] We welcome you back, Brother Gilbert. My
[29:34] goodness, it's great to have you home.
[29:37] I'm gonna put some super glue on that
[29:39] seat.
[29:42] Matthew, [music] nice to see everybody
[29:44] here. It's a wonderful thing about
[29:45] September. It's a wonderful thing.
[29:48] Everybody's coming back. Everybody's at
[29:49] home and sitting in their spots. [music]
[29:52] Few get displaced, but that's okay. like
[29:56] to see your smiling faces and [music] we
[29:58] want to greet you in the precious name
[29:59] of Jesus Christ. We have some special
[30:02] guests here this morning. We'd like to
[30:04] acknowledge brother Jean's mom and dad
[30:06] and sister are here. We've been waiting
[30:09] for so long for this event to take
[30:11] place. We want to acknowledge brother
[30:14] Jean Arthur. Dad, would you mind
[30:16] standing? Sister Mary, would you mind
[30:19] standing? Sister Naomi, they're here all
[30:21] the way from France. God bless you.
[30:24] [applause]
[30:25] Thank you.
[30:29] God bless you, brother Jean. You might
[30:32] as well stand identification as a son.
[30:35] I'm sure mom and dad have missed you
[30:36] much and we have [music] enjoyed the
[30:39] blessing of having your son here. He's
[30:43] been used of God and we thank [music]
[30:44] the Lord for him and I trust you have
[30:46] sweet fellowship not only with him but
[30:48] all that love him. And I would say that
[30:51] that's the church. So, God [music] bless
[30:53] you and welcome in the name of the Lord
[30:54] Jesus Christ. God bless you all. God
[30:57] bless you.
[30:59] Amen. [music and applause]
[31:04] We trust you feel very very welcome in
[31:06] his presence. Mom will be staying a
[31:08] little bit longer than dad and dad will
[31:10] be flying away [music] with business,
[31:12] but we expect to see him back soon. And
[31:14] Naomi will be here for a while taking
[31:17] school. So, [music] the sisters will
[31:19] surely get to know you very well, Naomi.
[31:22] God bless you. We have a special
[31:24] announcement also this next week coming
[31:26] up. We're moving our Wednesday service
[31:28] to Saturday [music] uh Saturday night at
[31:31] 7:00. Brother Joseph Hammet from
[31:34] Murphy'sboro, Tennessee [music] will be
[31:36] here this following week. So we're going
[31:38] to have a Saturday night and a Sunday
[31:40] morning service. And brother Joseph
[31:43] Hammet is pastor in Murphy'sboro and
[31:46] he'll be speaking again Saturday night.
[31:48] Wednesdays move to Saturday night at 7.
[31:50] [music] And then Sunday morning at 10:30
[31:53] a.m.
[31:55] Everybody got that? And Lord willing,
[31:58] September the 19th is a Friday night
[32:00] will be a prayer meeting and we'll be
[32:02] [music] announcing that again. But we'll
[32:04] be putting that on the bulletin board.
[32:06] And I believe that that is the end of
[32:09] the announcements. Let's just sing a
[32:11] little chorus as we give the service
[32:12] [music] back to brother Derek. Lord, I
[32:14] lift your name. God bless you.

[38:10] [music]
[38:13] Amen. I'll have you just bow your head
[38:16] with me to give him thanks. Heavenly
[38:18] Father, we are so grateful
[38:21] &gt;&gt; for the [music]
[38:22] uh first part of the service and how
[38:25] your presence I know has been [music]
[38:27] made known and felt amongst the people.
[38:30] Thank you for the visitors that are
[38:32] here. And Lord, this morning as we've
[38:34] already prayed, we are praying for
[38:37] brother Michael Andes and brother Ryan
[38:39] Hayes, far away in Malawi, but yet
[38:43] they're not far away from our hearts. Oh
[38:46] God, we pray the same spirit. Although
[38:49] it's evening time there, bless the word,
[38:52] oh God. And as Michael speaks, I pray
[38:55] you'll cause words to be spoken, Lord,
[38:57] and
[38:58] &gt;&gt; [music]
[38:58] &gt;&gt; uttered from his mouth, oh God. And may
[39:00] they know, Father, that brother, brother
[39:03] brother Ryan and brother Michael are
[39:05] being held up in prayer and being
[39:07] surrounded by prayer. We pray you'll
[39:10] make them an eternal blessing. Oh God,
[39:12] may something be done for the kingdom of
[39:14] God in your name raised up. We thank
[39:17] you, Father, for the guests that are
[39:19] here. Brother Jean Manassi's [music]
[39:21] family. And we hear Lord that brother
[39:23] Jean Commandis family wife and four
[39:27] children [music] have arrived in Canada
[39:29] to be with him. We pray oh God that he
[39:32] will rejoice in you and give you glory
[39:35] today. I know that he is. Pray
[39:38] especially Father for the word this
[39:40] morning for the people that have
[39:42] gathered see the church full and to know
[39:46] that there are those oh God that are
[39:48] streaming elsewhere. And Lord, I pray
[39:51] that you will bless the bride of Jesus
[39:54] Christ [music]
[39:55] throughout the world. Oh God, those
[39:58] bloodbought
[39:59] children of God. You've [music] paid the
[40:02] supreme price for them. And today, Lord,
[40:04] give us divine understanding. [music]
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Give us, I pray, the gift of
[40:09] understanding and knowledge, oh God, in
[40:12] the things of God. Help us to see the
[40:14] day that we're in. I ask father for
[40:17] special [music] help by the Holy Spirit
[40:20] that you will take control of the mouth
[40:22] of the speaker and Lord I pray you'll
[40:25] take control of the ears of the hearer
[40:29] and that you will take control of each
[40:31] one of our minds and spirits Lord and
[40:34] bring it under the management of the
[40:37] Holy Spirit. And I pray oh God you will
[40:40] come now to our soul that channel oh God
[40:44] may it be filled with faith to receive
[40:46] every word of God in the name of Jesus
[40:49] Christ we ask it. Amen.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I'll invite you to
[40:57] take your Bible and [music] come
[40:59] directly to the word. I'm reading out of
[41:01] Isaiah.
[41:04] I will read two places in the Bible that
[41:06] don't seem to fit together, but they
[41:09] will during the service.
[41:13] I'd like to make a comment while you're
[41:15] looking. And if you'll be listening very
[41:16] very carefully,
[41:19] something that I've pondered very much
[41:21] and I decided I would just like to make
[41:23] these three comments.
[41:26] the pattern of events
[41:29] that follow or take place within the
[41:32] body of believers. I'm talking about
[41:33] message believers.
[41:36] The pattern of the events that follow or
[41:38] take place within the body of believers
[41:42] of this message are in many cases in
[41:46] many cases identical to those
[41:49] experienced in the life of Jesus Christ
[41:52] when he was here on earth.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; That's number one.
[41:57] This is confirming that this message is
[42:02] the life of Jesus Christ being lived out
[42:05] in another form
[42:07] &gt;&gt; in the corporate body of Jesus Christ.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; That's number two.
[42:14] And it is the very same Lord Jesus
[42:16] Christ present here this morning now
[42:21] here in another form and in another
[42:25] season
[42:27] fulfilling perfectly Luke 17:30 in the
[42:30] day when the son of man is revealed
[42:33] because he is perhaps still revealing
[42:36] himself
[42:37] to some or revealing himself in a
[42:40] greater way to others.
[42:43] And and I'd like to say to you this
[42:45] morning, sometimes he is revealing
[42:47] himself when you aren't even aware of
[42:49] it.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; You think you're in church for Sunday
[42:53] morning service, but the the Lord Jesus
[42:56] Christ is intent on revealing himself to
[43:00] you.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; That's his purpose. And so with that, I
[43:03] want to address the congregation
[43:07] and those that are streaming.
[43:12] And there may be some streaming
[43:14] that are doubters
[43:17] or rejectors.
[43:18] I have a word for them also.
[43:23] I believe it's a word from God.
[43:26] Certainly a word from his prophet. May
[43:28] God bless his word. And we will read now
[43:33] from Isaiah 9 and we'll start at verse 6
[43:37] down through verse 8. [clears throat]
[43:40] Familiar scripture. For unto us a child
[43:44] is born.
[43:46] Unto us a son is given, and the
[43:49] government shall be upon his shoulder,
[43:52] and his name shall be called Wonderful,
[43:55] Counselor, the mighty God, the
[43:58] everlasting father, the prince of peace.
[44:02] Of the increase of his government and
[44:04] peace, there shall be no end. upon the
[44:08] throne of David and upon his kingdom to
[44:11] order it and to establish it with
[44:13] judgment and with justice from
[44:16] henceforth even forever. The zeal of the
[44:20] Lord of hosts will perform this.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; The Lord sent a word into Jacob. Notice
[44:29] sent a word into Jacob and it hath
[44:33] lighted upon Israel.
[44:36] I'll read a second scripture which is in
[44:40] Matthew
[44:43] the 26th chapter
[44:50] and verse 6
[44:53] [clears throat]
[44:59] down to 11.
[45:04] Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the
[45:06] house of Simon the leper, there came
[45:10] unto him a woman having an alabaster box
[45:12] of very precious ointment, and poured it
[45:15] on his head as he sat at meat. And when
[45:19] his disciples saw it, they had
[45:22] indignation, saying, "To what purpose is
[45:24] this waste?
[45:26] For this ointment might have been sold
[45:28] for much and given to the poor." When
[45:32] Jesus understood it, he said unto them,
[45:35] "Why trouble ye the woman? For she hath
[45:38] wrought a good work upon me,
[45:42] for ye have the poor always with you.
[45:46] But me, you have not always."
[45:51] He's Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[45:53] today, and forever. But in this case and
[45:56] in many instances in your case, me, you
[46:01] have not always at that moment or for
[46:04] that season or for that moment in time
[46:08] which she was seizing me. You have not
[46:11] always. So we'll ask God to bless his
[46:15] word. Heavenly Father, we ask you to
[46:18] take these words now and break it to us
[46:20] in Jesus name.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; That he might be glorified. Amen. You
[46:25] may be seated. [clears throat]
[46:33] So the zeal of the Lord shall perform
[46:35] this.
[46:39] Although God did not give all the
[46:42] details through Isaiah of how he will
[46:46] perform this. Nevertheless, he said that
[46:50] the Lord of hosts, he will perform this.
[46:52] the zeal, the zeal of the Lord of hosts
[46:57] shall perform this. It's uh it's
[47:01] important that we understand
[47:04] and I may be reaching out here this
[47:06] morning. Uh I've I've hesitated. I've
[47:10] really wondered about this, but I if God
[47:13] gives me grace and gives you grace to
[47:15] understand I understand I I realize
[47:18] we're speaking to a mixed multitude and
[47:21] perhaps many on the internet that are
[47:23] not under the full atmosphere of the
[47:26] service, but uh I I hope and I trust and
[47:30] pray that I will not be misunderstood.
[47:32] But the zeal of God to bring forth Jesus
[47:37] Christ.
[47:39] The redeemer
[47:41] is absolutely indescribable.
[47:44] It's completely indescribable.
[47:47] The zeal, the word zeal actually
[47:51] involves jealousy.
[47:53] That's one of the first uh meanings of
[47:56] the word. the the the zeal is the aror
[48:00] or passion.
[48:02] Uh it is love or fervor and it is
[48:06] referred to as one of the one of the
[48:08] things right in its own meaning in the
[48:11] in the scriptures is the jealousy or
[48:14] disposition of a husband.
[48:19] The reason why they couldn't understand
[48:21] Jesus Christ is because there are
[48:23] aspects of his message which just didn't
[48:26] have to do with living and love one
[48:29] another and those kind of things. But he
[48:33] was speaking from the disposition or
[48:35] from the position of a husband
[48:39] that they could not understand. The
[48:41] reason why people couldn't understand
[48:44] William Brham was because he's a prophet
[48:47] speaking thus sayaeth the Lord which now
[48:51] is the seed
[48:53] of God.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; And when you're dealing with the seed,
[48:57] there happens to be a certain level of
[49:00] jealousy.
[49:01] As Apostle Paul said to the Corinthian
[49:04] church, I'm jealous over you
[49:07] &gt;&gt; with a godly jealousy.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; For I have espoused you. I've given you
[49:13] an engagement to one husband, but I fear
[49:17] lest as the serpent beguiled Eve, so
[49:20] your mind should be corrupted.
[49:23] You understand? It has to do with the
[49:26] passage of seed.
[49:28] It has to do with one one who is giving
[49:33] it
[49:34] &gt;&gt; and and others who are receiving it. And
[49:38] then you'll understand
[49:40] things that the prophet of God spoke in
[49:43] this generation in a much different and
[49:46] greater way. I do believe
[49:50] so. Zeal is directly associated with the
[49:53] jealous dispossession
[49:56] of a husband.
[49:58] God forming a prophet vessel.
[50:02] God forming a prophet vessel to bring
[50:05] thus sayeth the Lord. He he prepared
[50:08] certain vessels.
[50:10] We call them prophets.
[50:12] For they said thus saith the Lord.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Who is that? That's that's a man saying
[50:21] thus sayaith the Lord. Not thus sayith
[50:24] Isaiah or thus sayith Jeremiah or thus
[50:26] sayith William Brandon. Thus sayith the
[50:28] Lord.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Are we are we got that?
[50:33] And the scripture tells us that the word
[50:36] is the seed.
[50:39] It's the seed. It's God's seed. Let's
[50:41] just go back to the beginning very
[50:43] moment for just a moment quickly. And I
[50:45] I I don't want to labor this too
[50:47] terribly much. And yet I want to convey
[50:49] this thought before we move forward. In
[50:52] the beginning, God said, "And God spoke
[50:54] and it was so." And God spoke and it was
[50:56] so. And he created man and uh and and he
[51:00] gave man his word.
[51:03] And he said, "Now about these trees, you
[51:05] can partake of this, but you can't
[51:07] partake of this one." And it was that
[51:10] very word that Satan through the serpent
[51:14] came to
[51:16] because he always wants to get to the
[51:19] source of the seed.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; And when he was able to twist her mind
[51:26] around concerning the further
[51:30] enlightenment,
[51:32] &gt;&gt; uh what was the next thing that
[51:34] happened? became an experience that we
[51:38] all have participated in in that we've
[51:40] been born through a sexual birth and by
[51:43] that we die. Every person in here is
[51:46] dying at different levels, at different
[51:49] times, at different seasons. We're we
[51:52] are we are on our road to die. Says it's
[51:56] appointed under man once to die and
[51:59] after this the judgment. So, we know
[52:01] that. And then there are those that are
[52:03] going to be raptured, defying death.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; God putting it in the face of Satan. I
[52:10] defy you.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; You started this on the wrong course.
[52:14] I'm correcting it and putting IT ON THE
[52:16] RIGHT COURSE.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; And the only way you could do that is to
[52:19] bring a redeemer
[52:21] &gt;&gt; of the seed of God, the beginning of a
[52:24] new creation. And thus, GOD WAS JEALOUS.
[52:27] I WILL READ some scripture. jealous over
[52:30] Zion, jealous to bring forth his word.
[52:33] That's why each OF THE PROPHETS CAME IN
[52:35] THE jealousy of the of of God because
[52:40] they were carrying the seed of God,
[52:43] searching out to find uh a womb to put
[52:47] that seed in.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; If you don't understand it, don't take
[52:54] me wrong.
[52:57] So the zeal of the Lord performed to
[52:59] fulfill.
[53:01] Unto us a child is born. Unto us a son
[53:05] is given. That's what it's talking
[53:06] about. The zeal of the Lord will perform
[53:09] this. The zeal of the Lord will bring
[53:12] forth this child, this son. This will be
[53:17] the seed of God. This will be the
[53:20] redeemer of the mankind.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; And in the scripture which we read in in
[53:31] Isaiah,
[53:33] it starts out with for unto us a child
[53:37] is born. But then in this in those two
[53:40] verses, it says of the increase of his
[53:43] government and peace there will be no
[53:46] end upon the throne of David and upon
[53:49] his kingdom to order it. And the prophet
[53:52] of God tells us very clearly many times
[53:55] that upon the throne of David, he comes
[53:58] to the throne of David in the
[54:00] millennium.
[54:02] So we are somewhere between unto us a
[54:05] son is given.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; A child is born that took place. Mary
[54:10] the virgin brought forth that son, the
[54:13] seed of the woman.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; But and we are somewhere between that
[54:17] because in the millennium he will be on
[54:20] a throne of David. SO WE ARE VERY CLOSE
[54:24] to that.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; WE'RE VERY CLOSE. THAT IS WHY FRIENDS,
[54:29] THE COUNTRY, the nation that God called
[54:31] and brought forth out of Abraham and
[54:34] brought out of bondage by Moses and and
[54:37] sits over there in this in a nation
[54:39] called Israel. That is why there's so
[54:42] much trouble on the news every day
[54:46] STRUGGLING ALWAYS constantly giving up
[54:49] land or giving up inheritance or
[54:51] fighting over their inheritance or
[54:53] fighting over their existence. What
[54:55] other nation is there that is threatened
[54:58] by hundreds of millions of people to be
[55:01] driven into the sea to be made extinct
[55:04] so THAT YOU DON'T EXIST ANYMORE? Would
[55:07] you want that as Canadians or as Germans
[55:10] or as British or what other nation or as
[55:13] Americans WOULD YOU WANT SOMEBODY
[55:15] THREATENING ON YOUR VERY SHORES? We're
[55:18] going to drive you into the ocean. WE'RE
[55:20] GOING TO DRIVE YOU INTO NON-EXISTENCE.
[55:23] we're going to drive you into
[55:24] annihilation. They live under that
[55:27] threat.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Why do they live under that threat? IT'S
[55:30] BECAUSE GOD HAS BROUGHT THEM FORTH BY A
[55:33] PROMISE. AND WE'RE NOT WE DON'T STAND
[55:36] for everything Israel stands for. Far be
[55:38] it. But there are some that are in that
[55:41] nation that are ELECTED TO RECEIVE THIS
[55:44] CHRIST. And they WILL SAY ONE DAY, THEY
[55:48] WILL SAY ONE DAY, "WHERE DID YOU GET THE
[55:50] WOUNDS?" in the house of my FRIENDS AND
[55:54] THEN THEY WILL have a revelation. Oh, he
[55:56] was the one that was crucified. HE IS
[55:59] THE SON. HE IS THE redeemer of Israel.
[56:02] He is the Messiah. Oh, MY FRIENDS, WE'RE
[56:06] RIGHT ON THE VERGE of that.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; So, HE'S NOT SITTING ON THE THRONE. AND
[56:11] THE PROPHET of God tells us uh he said
[56:15] it's not it's not the David that was
[56:18] king of Israel. It's not him. I'll read
[56:21] it probably a little bit later. And he
[56:24] said, "And it's not uh it's not Jesus.
[56:28] It's not Jesus as he was here on earth,
[56:30] but it is him that will as a son of
[56:34] David will sit on the throne. Sit on the
[56:37] throne of David his father.
[56:47] It was the seal of God
[56:50] in the people of the Old Testament.
[56:53] You see the the the the bringing forth
[56:56] of Jesus Christ unto us a son was is
[56:58] born. We we may say and there's a many
[57:02] that perhaps uh within religious world
[57:05] that attribute everything to Mary. The
[57:08] virgin wasn't just Mary. God was forming
[57:12] up this son way back.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Uh when he promised Abraham for a son,
[57:17] he wasn't thinking of Isaac. He was
[57:20] thinking of Christ.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; And he chose one man that would be
[57:24] called the father of the faith because
[57:26] God himself was determined to be A
[57:29] FATHER.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY HE CRIED OUT THROUGH ISAIAH
[57:33] ALSO, "WHERE'S MY FAMILY? WHERE'S MY
[57:36] HOUSEHOLD?" BECAUSE THIS IS THIS HAS
[57:38] BEEN IN HIS MIND. HEY, HE WANTS
[57:40] CHILDREN.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; AND THIS SON THAT HE'S GOING TO bring
[57:45] forth is going to be THE REDEEMER OF THE
[57:48] ENTIRE EARTH.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO REDEEM THE EARTH.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Is it all right thus far?
[57:58] &gt;&gt; We're just laying a bit of a foundation
[58:00] here.
[58:02] So the zeal of the God, the zeal of God
[58:05] in the people of the Old Testament,
[58:08] don't worry, we'll get down to your
[58:09] address in a few minutes that brought
[58:12] forth Jesus Christ. The coming and the
[58:15] birth of Jesus Christ involved many. It
[58:18] was not an isolated or singular event
[58:22] that just happened between Mary and and
[58:25] an angel and so on. That was the climax
[58:28] or the culmination of of all of this
[58:31] process all down. The Bible says, "And
[58:34] God formed man out of the dust of the
[58:36] earth." What did he do it in 24 hours or
[58:39] did he do it IN 24 YEARS? WE DON'T KNOW
[58:41] HOW long it took. It took centuries for
[58:45] God to form Jesus out of the old through
[58:48] the Old Testament. But it was through a
[58:50] series of people THAT WENT FROM FAITH TO
[58:52] FAITH to faith to faith. I WILL SAY FROM
[58:56] ELECTED TO ELECTED to elected to
[58:58] elected. IT WAS ALWAYS A PROCESS OF
[59:01] BRINGING HIM FORTH. AND THE PROPHET
[59:03] COMES IN THIS DAYS AND SAYS THERE'S
[59:04] MATTHEW uh I'm sorry there's uh there's
[59:08] uh Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph,
[59:12] the four corners of the statue of the
[59:15] Lord Jesus Christ, the masterpiece that
[59:18] he was forming and bringing forth. AND
[59:20] ALL THE PROPHETS spoke uh thus sayaith
[59:23] the Lord and tried TO BRING ISRAEL BACK
[59:26] to their PROMISES AND BACK TO God and
[59:29] and and they BE WENT INTO IDOLATRY and
[59:31] went into bondage AND EVERYTHING. BUT
[59:33] GOD NEVER CHANGED HIS MIND.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; I'm still going to use them. He never
[59:36] SAID, "WELL, I'LL WIPE you off the face
[59:38] of the map and I'll start with another
[59:40] nation." NO, HE NEVER DID. GOD GOD KEPT
[59:42] IT. HE HE'S HE'S got a onetrack mind. I
[59:45] MAKE A PROMISE AND THAT'S IT. DO
[59:49] &gt;&gt; YOU BELIEVE THAT?
[59:50] &gt;&gt; I MAKE A PROMISE AND THAT'S IT.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO BLESS I'M GOING TO BLESS
[59:54] THOSE THAT BLESS ABRAHAM. THAT'S IT.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO BLESS THIS MESSAGE AND
[1:00:01] THAT'S IT.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; SO, he's going to bring forth
[1:00:10] and many were involved with this. Many
[1:00:12] down through time were connected
[1:00:14] directly or indirectly the zeal of God
[1:00:20] bringing forth his son passing his word
[1:00:23] seed from generation to generation from
[1:00:27] believing heart to believing heart.
[1:00:30] Believers have always been connected
[1:00:32] with bringing forth Jesus Christ in the
[1:00:35] Old Testament. And remember now that was
[1:00:37] just a shadow.
[1:00:39] And the Bible is filled with record of
[1:00:42] people from vastly different backgrounds
[1:00:46] from different races from different
[1:00:49] levels of society.
[1:00:51] See, because we've got a mixed multitude
[1:00:54] here of people and levels of life. Some
[1:00:59] perhaps, you know, are well educated,
[1:01:01] others are poorly educated. it and it
[1:01:04] doesn't make any difference. And I'm
[1:01:06] saying that because because of the we
[1:01:10] have young, we have seniors, we have
[1:01:13] married, we have unmarried, we have
[1:01:15] different races and different ethnic
[1:01:17] groups. That has nothing to do with it.
[1:01:20] You are here. God has allowed you to
[1:01:22] come. God has allowed you to come to the
[1:01:25] earth. You've come BY A NATURAL BIRTH.
[1:01:28] God knows that. And God had in his mind
[1:01:31] another birth called a new birth.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; God had another SEED
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; IN HIS MIND. And he realized also that
[1:01:40] man, we all have come from a male seed
[1:01:44] into a woman's womb. And we were born at
[1:01:47] a certain time, at a certain season, and
[1:01:50] this is our season.
[1:01:58] I want to speak for a moment quickly
[1:02:01] on the zeal that brought forth a person
[1:02:04] or people to carry the faith seed. Some
[1:02:08] were ordained to give the seed
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; and others were ordained to carry the
[1:02:13] seed. Right?
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Jesus was ordained and sent. For God so
[1:02:20] loved the world, he sent his only
[1:02:23] begotten son.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; And when he came, he was declared to be
[1:02:28] the seed of God.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; He was declared to be the beginning of a
[1:02:32] new creation.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; If he's the beginning of the new
[1:02:35] creation, HE HAS TO BE THAT DIRECT SEED
[1:02:38] of God.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; And the PROPHET SAID HOW IT HAPPENED. HE
[1:02:42] DESCRIBED it very clearly. HE SAID THE
[1:02:44] WORDS OF THOSE PROPHETS,
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T ISAIAH, JEREMIAH,
[1:02:49] PSALMS, and so on. IT WAS THEY WERE
[1:02:53] ELECTED OR ORDAINED TO SAY CERTAIN
[1:02:56] THINGS THAT spoke of Christ.
[1:02:59] And and the prophet said, our prophet
[1:03:02] said that the words of those prophets,
[1:03:05] now try to imagine this. The words of
[1:03:08] those prophets anchored
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; in the womb of Mary
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; when she believed, "Let it be unto me
[1:03:17] according to THY WORD." AND THAT WAS IT.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; That was it.
[1:03:23] the seed germatized
[1:03:26] AND WAS CONCEIVED WITHOUT A MAN.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; GOD ALMIGHTY HIMSELF, THE HOLY GHOST
[1:03:33] shall overshadow thee. IF THE HOLY GHOST
[1:03:35] OVERSHADOWED A A A YOUNG GIRL, virgin
[1:03:38] girl, WHAT WILL THE HOLY GHOST DO TO
[1:03:41] PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME UNDER THIS MESSAGE?
[1:03:44] WHAT WILL THE HOLY GHOST DO WHEN HE
[1:03:46] HOVERS over the people of THIS MESSAGE?
[1:03:48] I TELL YOU WHAT, FRIENDS, THE THINGS OF
[1:03:50] LIFE BECOME STRANGELY DIM WHEN WE
[1:03:53] REALIZE, FULLY REALIZE AND give honor to
[1:03:56] why God HAS DONE WHAT HE'S DONE.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; And I'm not here to play little picnic
[1:04:02] games or to, you know, to speak lightly.
[1:04:06] I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT SUBSTANCE OF THE
[1:04:08] WORD of God. THIS MESSAGE HAS INCREDIBLE
[1:04:12] SUBSTANCE. And if THIS WERE MY LAST
[1:04:14] MESSAGE, I WOULD WANT TO CONVEY IT TO
[1:04:16] YOU IN ALL THE POWER AND ENERGY OF THE
[1:04:19] HOLY GHOST to drive it down into your
[1:04:22] heart.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; The prophets were ordained to pass the
[1:04:30] seed. Surely the Lord God will do
[1:04:32] nothing,
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; but he revealth his secret unto his
[1:04:37] servants, the prophets. The word OF THE
[1:04:39] LORD CAME unto the prophet. How many
[1:04:42] times it says that in the scripture and
[1:04:45] the now I want to just divert for a
[1:04:47] moment and speak of the zeal of God in
[1:04:50] Abraham
[1:04:52] to believe against all odds. FOR WHAT
[1:04:55] SHALL WE SAY? APOSTLE Paul says for what
[1:04:58] shall we say then that Abraham our
[1:05:00] father as pertaining to the flesh have
[1:05:03] found? What shall we say
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; about Abraham? What did he find sir?
[1:05:08] says, "Who against hope?"
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; He believed in hope that he would become
[1:05:15] the father of many nations. According to
[1:05:18] that which was spoken, so shall thy seed
[1:05:22] be.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHO AGAINST HOPE BELIEVED IN
[1:05:27] HOPE. When he heard those words spoken
[1:05:29] to him, WHAT LANGUAGE WAS IT SPOKEN? I
[1:05:32] DON'T KNOW, BUT those words were spoken.
[1:05:34] SO SHALL THY SEED BE. And Abraham said,
[1:05:38] "Our father in the faith," he said, "So
[1:05:41] be it."
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW HOW. I DON'T KNOW WHEN. I
[1:05:46] DON'T KNOW WHERE. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
[1:05:48] ABOUT IT. BUT I KNOW ONE THING. I HEARD
[1:05:50] the voice.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. WE MAY NOT KNOW WHEN. WE MAY
[1:05:55] NOT KNOW HOW. WE MAY NOT KNOW HOW THE
[1:05:57] ATOMS ARE GOING TO BE CHANGED. WE DON'T
[1:05:59] KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO IN A RAPTURE.
[1:06:02] BUT WE KNOW IT HAS BEEN SPOKEN. AND SO
[1:06:05] SHALL IT BE.
[1:06:09] Is it right?
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Does your faith say that?
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Are you a child of Abraham
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; who against hope believed in hope
[1:06:21] in the message Israel in the church
[1:06:24] prophet God said then he brought his
[1:06:27] seed down. So now we're watching and
[1:06:29] we're just going moving through the Old
[1:06:30] Testament quickly. The next thing he
[1:06:33] comes down through Abraham
[1:06:37] and then through Isaac
[1:06:40] and then through Jacob. And I
[1:06:43] underlined. I would have had it for you
[1:06:45] on the screen, but just accept my words
[1:06:48] for it. And then through Jacob. And then
[1:06:51] through Jacob to Joseph. Look, he said,
[1:06:54] "Election is in Abraham." Did you notice
[1:06:58] just those four patriarchs? And then it
[1:07:01] ceased, broke up, went out, went out in
[1:07:06] the 12 patriarchs, and the tribes tribed
[1:07:10] off. Never did return again till it
[1:07:14] returned in one,
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; the seed of Abraham. Then it came or
[1:07:20] come into the human being, which is
[1:07:23] Christ.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; It all broke off. THEN IT ALL ASSEMBLED
[1:07:27] BACK into one. Jesus Christ. Unto us a
[1:07:32] son was given and he said was glorified
[1:07:35] here on earth and lifted up unto God.
[1:07:38] And the Holy Ghost came back to spread
[1:07:41] the whole nations to fill the earth with
[1:07:44] knowledge of the Lord as deep as the
[1:07:47] heavens. And oh, that's the Holy Spirit
[1:07:50] today.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; I think of a number of others and I'm
[1:07:53] not going to go into it because I could
[1:07:55] preach a whole sermon on each of them.
[1:07:57] Uh I think of you've heard me preach on
[1:07:59] Tamar. She was compelled by the zeal of
[1:08:03] God to do things that she never dreamed
[1:08:06] she would do. She Tamar the
[1:08:10] daughter-in-law of of Judah and dressed
[1:08:13] herself in widowhood after two sons
[1:08:16] died. And he said go back to your father
[1:08:19] your father's house. And she dressed
[1:08:22] herself in the dress garments of
[1:08:23] widowhood. Notice the difference of
[1:08:25] garments. and she dressed herself in a
[1:08:28] garment of widowhood. Heard later that
[1:08:30] he was with his friend up shearing sheep
[1:08:33] and so near her town. So she dressed
[1:08:36] herself now in a garment of harlotry.
[1:08:39] And as a harlot sat by the roadside and
[1:08:43] and uh Judas saw her and asked now what
[1:08:48] was in his mind and what was in her mind
[1:08:50] were two totally different things. and
[1:08:52] he asked that he might have a
[1:08:55] relationship with her. And she asks him
[1:08:58] to give her uh to give her some some uh
[1:09:03] evidence of of the gift. He said, "I'll
[1:09:06] give you a kid uh little goat. I'll give
[1:09:10] you a kid for this uh service." And uh
[1:09:14] and she said, "Well, give me how do I
[1:09:15] know you'll come back?" He gave her, I
[1:09:18] think, a a signate and a rod or whatever
[1:09:21] more. gave two or three items and uh and
[1:09:25] then he goes to his friend and says,
[1:09:27] "Take this kid back to the harlot in the
[1:09:30] village." And he goes back and talks to
[1:09:32] the people cuz he can't find her. Talks
[1:09:35] to the men of the village and says, "Uh,
[1:09:38] where is the harlot that sits by the
[1:09:40] wayside?" Said, "No, there's no harlot
[1:09:43] in this village. There's no harlot
[1:09:46] here." So he goes back to Judah and
[1:09:49] says, "There's no harlot." REMEMBER NOW,
[1:09:52] JUDAH,
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; RIGHT,
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; IS carrying a seed.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; There had to be one. THERE WAS ONE
[1:10:01] COMING.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE THE the lion
[1:10:06] [clears throat] OF THE TRIBE of Judah.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Which would be none OTHER THAN JESUS
[1:10:11] CHRIST. HE HAD TO COME. BUT IT LOOKED AS
[1:10:14] THOUGH BY THE DEATH OF TWO MEN FROM
[1:10:17] JUDAH, HIS SONS, that this that this was
[1:10:21] going to be broken and it was going to
[1:10:23] end right here. IT MUST NOT END
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE FULFILLMENT OF THE SCRIPTURE
[1:10:29] MUST HAPPEN.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; AND SO SOMETHING POSSESSES HER AND
[1:10:35] DRIVES HER TO DO SOMETHING WHICH NO
[1:10:38] WOMAN would do. SHE WASN'T WANTING A
[1:10:41] SEXUAL EXPERIENCE. SHE WASN'T EVEN
[1:10:43] WANTING A MAN. SHE WASN'T WANTING A
[1:10:46] HUSBAND. SHE WAS WANTING THAT SEED.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. WHEN
[1:10:53] YOU SIT HERE AND YOU WANT THE WORD OF
[1:10:55] GOD THAT BAD,
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL FIND THAT COMING TO CHURCH ON A
[1:11:01] SUNDAY MORNING IS JUST INFATISMAL.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOTHING. SAY, I DRIVE QUITE A
[1:11:07] DISTANCE OR WE HAVE A LONG SERVICE.
[1:11:09] NONSENSE.
[1:11:12] THIS WOMAN WHO WAS A WIDOW PUT ON THE
[1:11:14] GARMENT OF HARLOTRY
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; TO GET THAT SEED.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; She didn't EVEN KNOW WHAT'S DRIVING HER.
[1:11:23] SOMETHING'S DRIVING HER, COMPELLING HER.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; SHE KNEW SHE WAS UNDER THE THREAT OF
[1:11:29] BEING BURNT TO DEATH.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; FOR SUCH AN ACT,
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; AND SHE RISKED EVERYTHING, INCLUDING HER
[1:11:35] OWN LIFE. WELL, I have to move on. I'm
[1:11:37] talking about, YOU SAY, WHAT CAUSED HER
[1:11:39] TO DO THAT? THE ZEAL of God.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; She didn't have it within herself. The
[1:11:46] zeal of God. YOU LOOK BACK INTO EACH OF
[1:11:50] OUR LIVES, YOU'LL FIND THAT WE DID SOME
[1:11:51] PRETTY STRANGE STUFF. We may made some
[1:11:54] very, VERY UNPOPULAR uh decisions in
[1:11:58] life. BUT WE TOOK A STAND AND GOD CAME
[1:12:02] BEHIND IT AND STOOD BY THAT STAND.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; WE'VE LEFT HOME. WE LEFT FRIENDS. WE
[1:12:09] LEFT FAMILY, LEFT MOTHERS AND FATHERS.
[1:12:12] SOME OF YOU, I KNOW I'M SPEAKING TO YOU.
[1:12:15] I KNOW WHAT SOME HAVE GONE THROUGH. I
[1:12:17] KNOW THAT SOME HAVE BEEN SAID, UH, GO TO
[1:12:20] THE PSYCHIATRIST. YOU HAVE LOST YOUR
[1:12:23] MIND. NO, THEY JUST GOT THEIR MIND.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Rejoice with me, friends, if you would.
[1:12:36] I think of the hot zeal of Moses.
[1:12:40] Moses.
[1:12:41] Moses,
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; right in line to step into the Pharaoh's
[1:12:47] throne.
[1:12:49] And now he's wandering in the wilderness
[1:12:53] as a smelly shepherd
[1:12:56] and leads all of these complaining
[1:12:59] people
[1:13:00] out for 40 years. 40 years.
[1:13:08] EVEN SAYS TO GOD, YOU ASK ME TO TAKE
[1:13:10] THESE PEOPLE. HOW CAN I CARRY THESE
[1:13:13] PEOPLE? AM I A FATHER? HAVE I BROUGHT
[1:13:16] THESE PEOPLE FORTH THAT I SHOULD CARRY
[1:13:18] THEM IN MY BOSOM?
[1:13:21] He said, if you don't go before us,
[1:13:24] if you don't go before us, don't lead us
[1:13:26] up.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; If this angel OF THE LORD DOESN'T lead
[1:13:30] us in this message, if it's not you
[1:13:34] leading us, don't let don't carry us up
[1:13:37] any further. WE MUST HAVE HIM.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; I'M TRYING TO ENERGIZE THIS
[1:13:44] CONGREGATION. WE MUST HAVE HIM.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT HIM, THIS IS AN EMPTY FORM.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT HIM, THIS IS JUST A GATHERING of
[1:13:56] people.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; We're not here just to enjoy one
[1:14:00] another's company.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; If we don't have him.
[1:14:05] And Moses,
[1:14:06] the zeal of God was driving him. And he
[1:14:10] went through all of the difficulties
[1:14:13] leading the people, but he did bring
[1:14:17] forth a people that became a nation. And
[1:14:20] finally, there was a people that could
[1:14:22] be called out
[1:14:24] of God known as the children of God, the
[1:14:29] children of Israel. For the first time,
[1:14:32] Moses moved it forward. There would be a
[1:14:35] people that would be that. Then we have
[1:14:37] others like Rahab and and Ruth. She was
[1:14:42] both a of a strange race and reduced to
[1:14:46] utter poverty. MOSES WAS AT THE TOP OF
[1:14:49] THE RICHEST AND MOST POWERFUL superpower
[1:14:52] on earth. This woman now she's at the
[1:14:55] bottom of the ladder.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; She's a she's a widow.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; HAS NEVER HAD A CHILD AND SHE'S OF the
[1:15:03] wrong race. She's of a race that's had
[1:15:06] its beginnings with incest.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Nothing to boast about. A
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Moabite.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Friends, you may have some I want I I
[1:15:20] want to stir your minds to think.
[1:15:24] And she was of a strange race and
[1:15:27] reduced to poverty.
[1:15:30] Yet Boaz neither despised her poverty
[1:15:33] nor her birth.
[1:15:35] If Ruth had not left her father's
[1:15:37] household and his kindred
[1:15:41] and her country, she would not have
[1:15:44] attained to the union with Boaz.
[1:15:48] We too having forsaken the creeds and
[1:15:52] the traditions and all the customs of
[1:15:55] our FATHERS WHO WALKED IN THE LIGHT OF
[1:15:58] THEIR DAY. WE'RE NOT DEGRADING THEM.
[1:16:01] We're not diminishing them. BUT WE HAVE
[1:16:03] LEFT FROM THAT. WE HAVE ANOTHER MESSAGE
[1:16:06] that has come from God. WE HAVE A THUS
[1:16:09] SAYAITH THE LORD, A VINDICATED WORD.
[1:16:12] WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO US?
[1:16:15] WHAT does it mean to us? Oh, it means
[1:16:18] everything.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; You're all my breath. YOU'RE MY YOU'RE
[1:16:22] MY SUNSHINE. YOU'RE MORE THAN LIFE TO
[1:16:24] ME.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; And because Ruth forsook all,
[1:16:32] she became the mother of kings,
[1:16:36] even as the church did likewise
[1:16:40] for her David himself. from D from her
[1:16:44] David himself sprung.
[1:16:47] You might say, "WHAT AM I DOING HERE ON
[1:16:49] A SUNDAY morning listening to this?" You
[1:16:51] have I'm announcing TO YOU. YOU HAVE
[1:16:53] BELIEVED A MESSAGE THAT'S going to BRING
[1:16:55] FORTH THE SON OF DAVID TO SIT ON A
[1:16:57] THRONE.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; You don't believe that?
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; That is according to the word of God.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Ruth brought forth Oed brought forth
[1:17:09] Jesse brought forth David. Ruth did
[1:17:12] perfect type of the bride of Jesus
[1:17:14] Christ.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; There came unto him a woman. Now he's
[1:17:23] born and he's here on earth and I've
[1:17:25] moved quickly as I as quickly as I
[1:17:28] possibly can. And there came a woman
[1:17:30] having an alabaster box,
[1:17:34] very precious
[1:17:37] ointment,
[1:17:39] and poured on his head as he sat at
[1:17:41] meat.
[1:17:43] And when the disciples saw it, they had
[1:17:45] indignation. They were very provoked.
[1:17:50] They were filled with indignation.
[1:17:52] And another scripture tells us it was
[1:17:54] Judas. He probably had the most
[1:17:57] indignation because he was the he was
[1:17:59] the treasurer and the keeper of the
[1:18:02] funds for the group of Jesus.
[1:18:06] And they were saying to what purpose is
[1:18:08] this waste?
[1:18:11] Think of this act.
[1:18:13] This woman is going to anoint him for
[1:18:15] his burial
[1:18:17] and they have identified it as a waste.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; How far off believers can be.
[1:18:30] Sometimes perhaps you've OBSERVED THINGS
[1:18:32] AND YOU THINK, "OH, THE MINISTRY DID
[1:18:34] THIS AND THE MINISTRY SAID THAT." LET ME
[1:18:36] TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU HAVEN'T GOT A
[1:18:37] CLUE WHAT THE MINISTRY IS doing or
[1:18:39] saying.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're compelled
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; TO DO A CERTAIN THING. I don't say
[1:18:46] everything the ministry does is correct,
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; but I'm SAYING THAT WE'RE UNDER A
[1:18:50] DIFFERENT THIS ISN'T JUST PREACHERS OF
[1:18:52] ANOTHER CHURCH. We're under a different
[1:18:54] KIND OF BAND-AID.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; WE STUDY A DIFFERENT KIND OF WORD.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE A WHOLE DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY OF
[1:19:01] THE SCRIPTURE
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S A LIVING WORD.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT, YOU HAVE NO
[1:19:12] BUSINESS BEING HERE.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; You must believe that
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE A DIFFERENT MESSAGE. WE'RE UNDER
[1:19:18] DIFFERENT OES. WE'RE UNDER A DIFFERENT
[1:19:21] LIGHT. WE'RE UNDER A DIFFERENT
[1:19:22] VINDICATION.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; I didn't intend on saying that, but it's
[1:19:29] free.
[1:19:33] And this OINTMENT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOLD
[1:19:34] FOR MUCH and given to the poor.
[1:19:39] And when Jesus understood it, he said
[1:19:41] unto them, and this is burning in my
[1:19:44] heart for
[1:19:46] many days now, why trouble ye the woman?
[1:19:50] for sheath has brought a good work upon
[1:19:52] me.
[1:19:54] For you have the poor always with you.
[1:19:57] But me,
[1:20:00] me,
[1:20:02] even though it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:20:03] yesterday, today, and forever, but me.
[1:20:06] At this this moment,
[1:20:09] you don't have always.
[1:20:14] You'll look back
[1:20:17] perhaps in future days
[1:20:19] say, "Oh, if I had only hear that again.
[1:20:23] Oh, if I'd only known what was really
[1:20:26] happening. Oh, if I'd only been
[1:20:28] listening. Oh, if I'd only given my
[1:20:31] best. Oh, if I had just strained at it
[1:20:35] as a as a people." as I see those and I
[1:20:38] heard about heard brother Ed talking
[1:20:40] about the women and the men of the old
[1:20:42] the Joshua and the Calebs and I heard
[1:20:45] the brothers preach about it and my
[1:20:47] heart was so stirred let it be more than
[1:20:50] stirred friends
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; even this morning
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; me
[1:20:57] you don't have always
[1:21:02] you're listening close
[1:21:05] me
[1:21:06] who he was referring to was a moving
[1:21:09] object.
[1:21:12] Me was soon going to be me was soon
[1:21:15] going to be crucif me was soon going to
[1:21:17] breathe his last breath.
[1:21:21] She couldn't COME A FEW DAYS LATER. THIS
[1:21:23] WAS ONLY ABOUT 6 DAYS BEFORE the
[1:21:24] crucifixion. SHE COULDN'T COME A FEW
[1:21:26] DAYS LATER AND SEE HIM AT THE CROSS AND
[1:21:28] SAY, "OH, IF I COULD ONLY DO IT NOW, MY
[1:21:30] ALABASTER BOX IS STILL IN THE ROOM. I'D
[1:21:33] LIKE I I LIKE TO DO IT NOW.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; ME,
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; you don't ALWAYS HAVE. WHEN THAT HOLY
[1:21:42] SPIRIT SPEAKS TO YOU, HE INTENDS HE'S
[1:21:45] COMING FROM THE ETERNITY. HE INTENDS
[1:21:48] THAT YOU MOVE. HE INTENDS THAT YOU SAY,
[1:21:50] "YES, HERE I AM, LORD."
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; What is it that you'd have me to do or
[1:21:58] say?
[1:22:04] And I know that this is for this
[1:22:05] congregation.
[1:22:07] Me, you don't always have.
[1:22:11] I'm going to come right to the heart of
[1:22:13] it right now. And I may come a little
[1:22:14] later.
[1:22:16] right in this time and brethren,
[1:22:19] right in this season in the message,
[1:22:22] this Christ,
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; this Christ that's been revealed,
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; THIS CHRIST THAT FINALLY CAME across the
[1:22:31] nation was birthed in America. AND GOD
[1:22:36] KNEW the son coming from east to west
[1:22:39] and this great nation that would be uh
[1:22:42] the most generous and the uh protector
[1:22:46] of nations of many in the world and who
[1:22:49] whose part in the birth painans of the
[1:22:52] first and second world war primarily
[1:22:55] this nation that that the god would
[1:22:58] bring forth and to be a superpower. AND
[1:23:01] FINALLY IN OUR DAY, in our day in this
[1:23:05] season would become the the singular
[1:23:08] superpower. And in your day, you begin
[1:23:12] to see the decline. And in your day, you
[1:23:16] begin to see immorality
[1:23:18] creep uh through over the nation. And in
[1:23:22] your day, YOU BEGIN TO SEE SODOM SWEEP
[1:23:26] over the nation. AND IN YOUR DAY, YOU
[1:23:28] see it come into every home and room.
[1:23:32] And in your day, YOU SEE THAT young
[1:23:34] people and your children carrying it in
[1:23:38] their hands, the ability to reach into
[1:23:41] the internet and enter the vast resource
[1:23:44] of the of of the world. AND IN YOUR DAY,
[1:23:48] YOU'VE SEEN THIS decline
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; until you said, "Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh,
[1:23:56] God. What an age, what a time that we're
[1:23:59] LIVING IN, OH GOD. WHAT CAN PRESERVE US?
[1:24:03] OH GOD, WHAT CAN HOLD US? WHAT CAN HOLD
[1:24:06] THESE marriages together? What can what
[1:24:08] can give a good girl a good man and a
[1:24:11] good man a GOOD WIFE? WHAT IS THERE? OH
[1:24:14] GOD, THIS GENERATION IS SINKING INTO
[1:24:18] SUCH A SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS. WHO'S GOING
[1:24:21] TO PRESERVE THESE FAMILIES? WHO'S GOING
[1:24:24] TO PRESERVE these children? Who's going
[1:24:26] to preserve these young men and these
[1:24:28] young women? I can tell you friends,
[1:24:31] there will be a FEW AND NOT MANY THAT BY
[1:24:34] THE ZEAL OF GOD WILL GUIDE THEIR HOMES.
[1:24:40] GUIDE AND BE BE OFFICERS IN A CHURCH.
[1:24:43] AND THAT PEOPLE THAT COME TOGETHER WILL
[1:24:45] NOT COME TOGETHER TO HAVE A Sunday
[1:24:48] service. THEY'LL COME TOGETHER TO HEAR
[1:24:50] SOMETHING OF THE WORD of God. THEY'LL
[1:24:53] COME TOGETHER TO BE TRANSFORMED BY THE
[1:24:56] POWER of God. THEY'LL COME TOGETHER
[1:24:58] UNTIL THEY GET A DIFFERENT set of
[1:25:00] values.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; This woman didn't know.
[1:25:10] The guests at the dinner didn't know
[1:25:13] what she was doing.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; The disciples
[1:25:17] didn't know what she was doing.
[1:25:19] She didn't know what she was doing.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; All she knew
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; IS THAT SOMETHING WASN'T QUITE RIGHT.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; I don't know what it is,
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; BUT I KNOW ONE THING THAT HE DESERVES MY
[1:25:35] BEST.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; And incidentally, 300 pence. They worked
[1:25:41] for one pence was as a silver Roman
[1:25:44] coin. That was a day's salary. And 300
[1:25:49] days was nigh unto a year's salary that
[1:25:53] she bust and broke over his head in one
[1:25:57] place over his feet.
[1:26:07] We Christ is in another form.
[1:26:11] You're following a message whose
[1:26:13] messenger was put out of every door.
[1:26:17] He said, "I've been in Tucson here for
[1:26:19] about three years and all the doors are
[1:26:21] closed. I haven't had one invitation."
[1:26:23] Why? Not because of him, but while he
[1:26:26] was carrying
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; the word THAT WOULD TRANSFORM YOU AND I
[1:26:33] THUS SAYETH THE LORD TO A NATION,
[1:26:36] carrying it in his BOSOM AND DOORS
[1:26:40] shutting
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; because Revelation 3:14, I believe it
[1:26:44] is, HAD TO BE FULFILLED. ARE YOU
[1:26:46] LISTENING YOUNG PEOPLE?
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; And he was found out who he me
[1:26:54] not me at me.
[1:26:57] Me you do not have always. He could have
[1:27:00] SAID IT TO THE PEOPLE BEFORE THEY PUT
[1:27:02] HIM OUT.
[1:27:04] IN REVELATION HE'S FOUND OUTSIDE,
[1:27:07] but it had to be lived out IN THIS DAY.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; A MINISTRY, A WORTHY MINISTRY, A
[1:27:13] SUPERNATURAL MINISTRY. ONE LIKE HAD
[1:27:16] NEVER BEEN EXPRESSED IN THE IN THE WORLD
[1:27:18] of revealing THE SECRET OF THE HEARTS
[1:27:21] AND TELLING PEOPLE WHERE THEY came from
[1:27:23] and those things they say and and the
[1:27:25] and the devil tried to bring up some
[1:27:26] cheap substitute
[1:27:28] even brought it on the television stuff
[1:27:30] cheap it was it wasn't even worth a
[1:27:33] wooden nickel
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; are you with me
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; and he's put out had to be put out he
[1:27:43] had to endure that
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; he had TO BE PUT OUT BECAUSE IT WAS
[1:27:49] CHRIST IN HIM BEING PUT OUT.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; If he had to be put out, did he say,
[1:28:01] "Well, I don't have any more
[1:28:03] invitations. I guess I'll just give it
[1:28:05] up." No.
[1:28:08] No.
[1:28:09] There was a zeal of God.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Forgive me, you may not understand this,
[1:28:16] but that zeal of God in him was saying
[1:28:18] there's a virgin bride
[1:28:21] that needs to be pregnantated with this
[1:28:23] word.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; THIS MUST HAPPEN
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE SERPENT DID WHAT HE DID.
[1:28:31] THIS MUST HAPPEN.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; HE IS WORTHY OF A VIRGIN BRIDE AND THE
[1:28:36] ZEAL OF GOD IN HIM. THE ZEAL OF GOD
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; WAS PRESSING HIM UNTIL SHE SHOULD BE
[1:28:43] BROUGHT FORTH. AND I CAN SAY THIS
[1:28:45] MESSAGE IS BROUGHT FORTH. A VIRGIN BRIDE
[1:28:49] PREGNANT BY THE PURE SEED OF GOD.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Listen to me friends. You don't have to
[1:28:58] EMPOWER THAT SEED. THAT SEED IS ALREADY
[1:29:00] EMPOWERED
[1:29:02] WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND IT WILL BRING
[1:29:05] FORTH JESUS CHRIST
[1:29:08] IN THIS WORLD AND YOU ARE CALLED TO
[1:29:11] MANIFEST THAT LIFE.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; You don't have to produce it. You just
[1:29:16] manifest it.
[1:29:23] Neither the guests
[1:29:25] nor the Pharisees nor the disciples nor
[1:29:28] the woman doing it understood what was
[1:29:30] happening.
[1:29:32] The prophet messenger delivered the word
[1:29:35] seed to a bride people who will carry
[1:29:38] the seed to manifest Jesus Christ.
[1:29:42] And the prophet said in the message
[1:29:44] shalom, "God
[1:29:47] is a jealous God."
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; You'll understand more what these
[1:29:51] phrases mean perhaps when you leave. He
[1:29:54] is jealous and he wants his wife pure.
[1:29:58] Isn't it amazing? He talks about wife in
[1:30:00] the same sentence.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; I haven't got time today. You have to
[1:30:06] forgive me. I haven't got time. Do you
[1:30:08] mind if I take my jacket off?
[1:30:13] In the Old Testament,
[1:30:15] I have I have a few scriptures. The
[1:30:17] greatest jealousy that can be known on
[1:30:19] earth and one of the causes for a lot of
[1:30:22] crimes is the jealousy of man over his
[1:30:24] wife or wife or her husband. And so in
[1:30:28] the Old Testament, so when a man is
[1:30:30] jealous over his wife and when a man and
[1:30:33] and and the spirit of jealousy comes on
[1:30:36] him
[1:30:38] and so on and then it finally finally
[1:30:40] God gives instructions. I haven't got
[1:30:42] time to go into it, but he can bring he
[1:30:45] can bring the wife to the priest and
[1:30:48] bring an offering and it's called the
[1:30:51] jealousy offering.
[1:30:54] It all had to do with one thing. There
[1:30:57] was a relationship between the husband
[1:30:59] and wife and what we have and what we
[1:31:02] know of down here. Listen to me friends.
[1:31:05] You're adults. I don't want to go into
[1:31:07] detail. But you must understand what is
[1:31:11] the absolute
[1:31:15] obsession
[1:31:18] of this age.
[1:31:21] It's sex.
[1:31:24] twisted sex, perverted sex over getting
[1:31:27] married. I can't You can't stand I dare
[1:31:31] you to stand in the in the market at the
[1:31:33] at the cash counter and all you'll be
[1:31:36] faced with is what Hollywood is doing.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Hollywood, this woman is dumped and that
[1:31:41] guy is dumped and this one is getting
[1:31:43] and this one's getting a divorce. And I
[1:31:45] I just say what else is new?
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Garbage. Garbage. just trash and
[1:31:52] garbage. And you go down the street in
[1:31:54] the road and and there all all of the I
[1:31:57] won't go into it, but all the gay
[1:31:58] parades and what do you mean gay parade?
[1:32:01] Where's Where's all the straight people?
[1:32:04] Where's all the upright people? What's
[1:32:06] wrong with the right home? What's wrong
[1:32:08] with saying something about a right
[1:32:10] home? WHAT'S WRONG WITH SAYING SOMETHING
[1:32:12] ABOUT A FAMILY?
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; COME ON, FOLKS.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; LET THE VOICE YOUR VOICE be heard.
[1:32:24] Tell you what, friends, you got an old
[1:32:27] man behind this pulpit, but the zeal of
[1:32:29] God burns in me. I wish it burned in
[1:32:31] every one of you the same degree it
[1:32:33] burns in me.
[1:32:37] Don't take a weak stand on these things.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; At least live it.
[1:32:47] He's a jealous God and he wants his wife
[1:32:49] pure. He wants her a virgin chased
[1:32:52] nothing in the world in into her at all.
[1:32:56] Altogether his word part OF HIM. WHAT'S
[1:32:59] HE TALKING ABOUT? IT DOESN'T WANT
[1:33:01] ANYTHING FROM the world. IT DOESN'T WANT
[1:33:02] ANY CONVERSATION OR ANY WORDS from the
[1:33:05] world to make up part of her being. He
[1:33:08] only wants her word, his word IN HER.
[1:33:11] WHAT'S HE SAYING? I WANT MY SEED IN MY
[1:33:14] LIFE,
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; pregnantated with his word and possessed
[1:33:25] of his zeal to bring forth the life of
[1:33:28] Jesus Christ to sit on the throne of
[1:33:31] David in the millennium. Listen in the
[1:33:34] message. I hope I can say this
[1:33:38] in the way of a true prophet.
[1:33:41] in the message the way of a true
[1:33:43] prophet. You know what this last two
[1:33:45] paragraphs are? The last two stanzas of
[1:33:49] this is like a song.
[1:33:52] Oh lion
[1:33:54] of the tribe of Judah,
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; rise up and roar is in his prayer.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; His closing prayer.
[1:34:03] Oh lion of the tribe of Judah,
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; rise up and roar. Thou art roaring in
[1:34:09] this last day. Your eyes are narrowed.
[1:34:14] You're looking down. You're seeing THE
[1:34:16] SIN OF THIS SO-CALLED CHRISTIAN nation
[1:34:20] and world. You're seeing the sin of this
[1:34:23] nation when it's been brought when it's
[1:34:25] been bought with precious blood. What
[1:34:28] you talking about? Blood that didn't
[1:34:30] come by a sexual birth. Blood of the new
[1:34:33] creation of God. I'm preaching to a
[1:34:36] people. said, "A nation that you raised
[1:34:39] up HAS BEEN BOUGHT, PURCHASED. NO WONDER
[1:34:43] THIS MESSENGER of the owner is zealous."
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE SEEING THE SIN OF THIS NATION
[1:34:52] when it's been brought bought with the
[1:34:54] precious blood. You're seeing how the
[1:34:56] denominations are waiting over your
[1:34:59] word. What's he saying? the
[1:35:00] denominations with their own word,
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; their own seed,
[1:35:07] waiting over your word,
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; just waiting and walking over it and
[1:35:12] saying, "Well, we don't believe that.
[1:35:13] This is what WE BELIEVE." I DON'T CARE
[1:35:15] WHAT THEY BELIEVE.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; It's what GOD CONFIRMS IS HIS SEAT.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; I'M INTERESTED IN SEED THIS MORNING.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; THUS SAITH THE LORD.
[1:35:27] AND WE HAVEN'T GOT THAT COME OUT OF SOME
[1:35:29] HUMAN MIND that's nothing more than a
[1:35:31] teaspoon of ashes.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; We're not interested in teaspoons of
[1:35:35] ashes. WE'RE INTERESTED IN WHAT GOD SAID
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; and what not not what somebody thinks he
[1:35:42] said.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; See how the false prophets are lying.
[1:35:56] That's not that's not uh maybe what they
[1:36:00] consider culture language. That was the
[1:36:03] truth.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; See how false prophets are lying. What
[1:36:07] is false prophet? That's somebody who's
[1:36:09] carrying a word and their word, God's
[1:36:12] truth, they're denying. Roar, oh lion of
[1:36:17] Judah.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about this li this line.
[1:36:22] this not this lion but this line
[1:36:26] of this lineage that almost didn't make
[1:36:28] it
[1:36:30] almost couldn't make it. Think of it
[1:36:34] when Judah looked like there would be no
[1:36:37] more children birth.
[1:36:40] Oh lion of Judah, let your prophets cry
[1:36:43] out.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; When God speaks, who can keep from
[1:36:48] prophesying? It's the word of God coming
[1:36:50] out of the Bible. moving up through the
[1:36:53] prophet. How can he hold his peace? If
[1:36:56] he would, he'd blow to pieces. Oh God,
[1:36:59] let your prophets roar.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Let Lord roar out. Roar out your message
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; and let every creature of your kingdom
[1:37:08] take heed.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Said, I believe, Lord, if you'd send
[1:37:12] Amos here, he'd cry out the same thing.
[1:37:15] For he could not
[1:37:17] cry. But if he he is a prophet of the
[1:37:19] Lord, he's a sender forth of the word.
[1:37:23] In other words, he transfers the word,
[1:37:25] the seed word of God. He is sent forth
[1:37:28] by the word with the word. And he is the
[1:37:31] word.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Now Lord, let it be done in the name of
[1:37:34] Jesus Christ. That's the end of that
[1:37:36] message.
[1:37:41] The woman,
[1:37:43] she happened to be Mary of Bethany.
[1:37:47] that broke the ointment.
[1:37:50] She's the sister of Martha and Lazarus.
[1:37:57] I'm taking you. I mentioned that because
[1:38:02] she was so disheartened
[1:38:04] when her pastor
[1:38:07] Jesus Christ wouldn't come when her her
[1:38:12] brother was sick
[1:38:14] and he waited till he died.
[1:38:18] She had disappointments
[1:38:22] and she had been she had walked with
[1:38:24] Jesus as you have walked in the message
[1:38:27] for a long time
[1:38:32] not only months but perhaps years she
[1:38:35] had walked. So she's seen she's seen all
[1:38:38] the great crowds and she saw all the
[1:38:42] perhaps miracles and saw all of these
[1:38:44] things and now uh he's become rather
[1:38:49] silent and she has seen a decline
[1:38:54] and perhaps we've seen something that is
[1:38:57] you think is a diminishing and you say
[1:39:00] what is all of this happening? What is
[1:39:02] all this business in the message? What
[1:39:05] is all this stuff?
[1:39:09] Have you been there?
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Have you read some things?
[1:39:16] Have you been there?
[1:39:18] You don't have to answer that. I know
[1:39:20] you have.
[1:39:23] What is this? What is this about
[1:39:26] ministers of the message denying it and
[1:39:29] leaving it? Well, when Jesus she walked
[1:39:31] with Jesus and Jesus said some words and
[1:39:36] a whole multitude of people left him.
[1:39:40] So she saw that
[1:39:43] where' they all go
[1:39:46] and then finally 70 that he chose to
[1:39:49] work with him, commissioned with him to
[1:39:52] go and preach with him. 70 they said who
[1:39:55] can who who who can understand this? who
[1:39:57] can understand, you know, what he said,
[1:40:00] who I can't put this together. Uh, some
[1:40:03] of it seems to go against the Bible, the
[1:40:05] Torah. Some of we we don't understand
[1:40:07] it. We can't understand it. And they
[1:40:09] they kind of withdrew and finally they
[1:40:12] left.
[1:40:14] So, she saw 70 leave preachers,
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; miracle workers,
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; sent out by Jesus himself.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Saw them go.
[1:40:27] I have to ask I have to ask this
[1:40:28] congregation.
[1:40:32] I want you to ask yourself where would
[1:40:34] you be?
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Where would you be?
[1:40:41] You put yourself back in the Bible. I
[1:40:43] don't have to answer that. You put
[1:40:45] yourself there.
[1:40:54] When you look at me, you don't look at
[1:40:55] something that's historical.
[1:40:57] I'm talking about something as fresh as
[1:40:59] tomorrow morning's newspaper.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; I only ask you that because I asked
[1:41:05] myself that
[1:41:13] she couldn't explain everything.
[1:41:17] In fact, she couldn't hardly explain
[1:41:19] anything.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; All she knew here, he sits just six days
[1:41:25] before the Passover.
[1:41:28] Just six days
[1:41:31] and all the people in the population and
[1:41:34] all the popularity is gone and all the
[1:41:37] greatness is gone. And here he is at a
[1:41:41] at a supper
[1:41:43] and he's sitting there.
[1:41:47] Somehow it's not just right. It's not
[1:41:50] right.
[1:41:52] She runs home,
[1:41:55] gets an alabaster box. I'm going to ask
[1:41:57] you, what is your alabaster box?
[1:42:01] And brings it to him and breaks it. She
[1:42:04] doesn't understand. She's just driven.
[1:42:07] Now watch closely, friends. I have
[1:42:09] something to say. She just driven. She
[1:42:12] breaks that ointment on him and spills
[1:42:15] all out and everybody. Everybody, it's
[1:42:18] such a waste.
[1:42:22] She didn't know what she was doing.
[1:42:26] I said right in that study,
[1:42:29] I said, I I don't know why
[1:42:33] I was so obsessed.
[1:42:36] maybe 40, 45 or 50 years ago. It sounds
[1:42:39] like A LONG TIME. IT'S NOT long ago. I
[1:42:42] lived it
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; and I went overseas to Africa
[1:42:48] and saw the people and many of them
[1:42:50] couldn't speak very clear English and
[1:42:53] they're listening to a message ON TAPE
[1:42:55] AND THEY'D look at me with those dark
[1:42:57] eyes and know that I had books and know
[1:43:00] that I had tapes, know I had red
[1:43:03] volumes, know I had it in this form and
[1:43:05] that form and they're saying, "Oh,
[1:43:08] you're so lucky. You're so fortunate you
[1:43:11] have it.
[1:43:13] And I I heard some of them speaking and
[1:43:15] as I listened they're speaking in
[1:43:18] Kentucky
[1:43:19] accent because they just listen to the
[1:43:22] tapes. I talked to some ministers and
[1:43:25] they learned English from listening to
[1:43:27] the tapes.
[1:43:29] And I thought, I can hardly understand
[1:43:32] some of those tapes myself because the
[1:43:35] the production is so poor and the and
[1:43:39] the uh it's so poor and I don't know
[1:43:41] what they're listening to it on. And I
[1:43:43] come back and I spoke to a a widow
[1:43:47] woman. I won't use her name.
[1:43:49] And I told her this. I said, "I look at
[1:43:51] those black eyes.
[1:43:54] They don't have the message." I said, "I
[1:43:57] just I'm I feel driven." I didn't tell
[1:44:00] her that. I want to clean these tapes. I
[1:44:03] want to filter these tapes and make the
[1:44:06] best tapes we can. Why? What was driving
[1:44:09] it was a zeal
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD'S PEOPLE, THE ELECT OUT THERE,
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; MIGHT HEAR CLEARLY, AS CLEAR AS
[1:44:19] POSSIBLE, THE VOICE. And so, WE STARTED
[1:44:22] CLEANING THE TAPES. And in this study
[1:44:24] today, I can't can't remember ever doing
[1:44:27] it. I just thank God. God, I just wanted
[1:44:29] to pour this part of my life out. And I
[1:44:32] got others and others other young man.
[1:44:34] He worked four years. Four years. He
[1:44:37] wasn't worried about salary. I think we
[1:44:39] gave him something to eat. I don't know
[1:44:41] what we gave him. I have no idea. But he
[1:44:44] worked for four years full time. Full
[1:44:47] time in a little log room. And we had
[1:44:50] all the tapes there. and they listen to
[1:44:53] all the tapes and make a diary of the
[1:44:57] sounds and the noises and then start
[1:44:59] cleaning and filtering the tapes. We
[1:45:01] filtered 530 tapes. 530 in four years.
[1:45:08] I'm so glad
[1:45:10] to have poured out those years.
[1:45:13] They had on the radio broadcast for a
[1:45:15] little while.
[1:45:19] Some people, you know them, the
[1:45:21] Ploachers from Montana and they're
[1:45:23] probably streaming say greetings to the
[1:45:26] Ploer family.
[1:45:31] I heard that Sister Ploer was coming.
[1:45:33] Matthew Redell told me sister Ploer's
[1:45:35] parents or her mothers. He's He says, "I
[1:45:39] think she's going to be she's going to
[1:45:41] be visiting her mother in Vancouver."
[1:45:45] And I was a little bit nervous.
[1:45:48] She hadn't been here before.
[1:45:50] Never thinking of maybe moving here or
[1:45:52] whatever. I never want to try to
[1:45:55] persuade people on that.
[1:45:59] And she was here with her husband and
[1:46:02] walked out and and almost everybody had
[1:46:04] gone. And then I saw they were still
[1:46:06] there. I was talking to a person. I
[1:46:07] said, "Excuse me, I have to run. I want
[1:46:09] to see these people." I believe Brother
[1:46:12] Mark and Sister Sally, you were just
[1:46:14] with the poachers, right? I saw the
[1:46:17] pictures looked very nice.
[1:46:21] And so I walked over just brother and
[1:46:22] sister poster by themselves. I said,
[1:46:24] "Well, how are you?" I said, "It's so
[1:46:26] nice to
[1:46:28] to meet you." I said, "Your husband has
[1:46:31] told me about you. It's nice to see
[1:46:33] you." I said, "I understand that your
[1:46:36] mother's from Canada and is in
[1:46:38] Vancouver." She said, "Actually, my
[1:46:41] mother's in Langley."
[1:46:43] Oh. I said, "Goodness, Langley, just
[1:46:45] right here. Your mother's in Langley."
[1:46:48] And she said, "Yes." She said, "Many
[1:46:51] years ago, you had a radio broadcast."
[1:46:54] And she said, "And my mother wrote and
[1:46:56] you sent her tapes
[1:46:58] and then she wrote again and you sent
[1:47:01] her a church age book." And she said, "I
[1:47:03] read the church age book and I came into
[1:47:05] the message."
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; That was about about 10 seconds of a
[1:47:11] testimony. I thought, "Praise God. I'm
[1:47:14] so glad we
[1:47:16] so glad we sent her." Didn't know what
[1:47:19] you're doing when somebody's sending out
[1:47:21] that church age book. But isn't that
[1:47:23] wonderful?
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; This woman didn't know what she was
[1:47:28] doing.
[1:47:38] I don't want to conclude.
[1:47:41] I've got to conclude right away. But I
[1:47:44] don't want to conclude without saying
[1:47:48] unto us a son is unto us a child is
[1:47:52] born. Unto us a son is given.
[1:47:55] And he'll be called wonderful and
[1:47:58] counselor and mighty God and the father
[1:48:02] and all of these things. and he will be
[1:48:05] on the throne of his father David
[1:48:09] and a prophet comes and lets us know who
[1:48:12] wants to know that'll be in the
[1:48:14] millennium
[1:48:16] he'll be on his
[1:48:19] but all of that scripture from one point
[1:48:22] to the other point the zeal of God shall
[1:48:27] perform this
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; and you may wonder what it is that you
[1:48:31] sense or feel in a service perhaps like
[1:48:34] This it is the zeal of God that is
[1:48:38] registering something in your heart and
[1:48:40] life and soul that is that is is is
[1:48:43] pressing forward to perform this.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS ONE THING IN HIS MIND REVEAL AND
[1:48:51] MANIFEST JESUS CHRIST IN THIS WORLD. YOU
[1:48:55] KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING? HE'S SAYING I'VE
[1:48:56] COME TO OVER I'VE COME TO TAKE IT OVER.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; I PAID FOR THIS WHOLE WORLD.
[1:49:03] I'VE HAD I'VE SENT A PROPHET AND HE TOLD
[1:49:05] YOU HOW IT'S GOING TO BE renovated
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; and it's going to burn up with with
[1:49:09] UNQUENCHABLE FIRE
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; and the and the thing that's in you
[1:49:13] right now is THE SPIRIT OF HIM WHO SPOKE
[1:49:16] this
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; is in me and the zeal of God is in ME
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; AND THUS SAYITH THE LORD IS IN ME
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; AND the and the seed of God is in me
[1:49:25] producing Jesus CHRIST
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; AND THAT JESUS CHRIST HAS ALREADY
[1:49:30] DECLARED I own this place.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I I'M GOING TO COME BACK
[1:49:35] HERE WITH MY BRIDE AND LIVE HERE.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get rid of all of this
[1:49:42] filth.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; AND THE SCRIPTURE SAYS EVEN THE HEAVENS
[1:49:45] WILL BE ON FIRE. WHY? BECAUSE THOSE
[1:49:48] VOICES that you may hear coming on the
[1:49:51] radio, all of you on the television and
[1:49:55] God forbid that and on on and it's
[1:49:58] printed down and through the internet
[1:50:00] and they call it the worldwide world
[1:50:04] web. I have an announcement. There's
[1:50:07] another web
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; and there's another world. And the
[1:50:10] prophet says even the heavens will be on
[1:50:13] fire because of the demon power
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF THE DARKNESS of devils.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; I shouldn't have to I shouldn't have to
[1:50:24] expound on it. You should catch that AND
[1:50:26] JUST SAY GLORY BE TO GOD.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; The zeal THAT'S IN ME IS CRYING OUT FOR
[1:50:31] THAT. OH FIRE OF GOD BURN ON BURN UP.
[1:50:37] BURN UP THESE ELEMENTS OUT OF THE
[1:50:38] HEAVENS. BURN ALL THIS PERVERSION OUT OF
[1:50:41] THE HEAVENS. BURN ALL THIS DEMON POWER
[1:50:44] IN DARKNESS.
[1:51:02] He said me you don't have always.
[1:51:08] I want to say to this congregation, we
[1:51:11] need to seize. We need to really ponder
[1:51:14] this message.
[1:51:17] Ponder what the Holy Spirit will speak
[1:51:19] to you in the next coming days.
[1:51:22] I will tell you, even if we're like Mary
[1:51:24] of Bethany, she maybe just made a lot of
[1:51:27] meals.
[1:51:29] She entertained the word.
[1:51:32] When she had a sick brother, he was
[1:51:34] called.
[1:51:35] Christ was called. He didn't come when
[1:51:38] they wanted to. Didn't always get the
[1:51:40] response they wanted.
[1:51:43] Began to see things that they couldn't
[1:51:45] understand.
[1:51:46] This one leaves.
[1:51:49] That one denies.
[1:51:51] The church secretary is gone.
[1:51:54] We understand he committed suicide or
[1:51:57] hung himself,
[1:51:59] cast himself down.
[1:52:01] What a record.
[1:52:05] Who wants to join that church?
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Only those
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; who have zeal of God in it.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Only those elected.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Only those that ARE GIVEN AN INSIGHT
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; AND they know the season that it's him.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; And to me, to me, this is not a dark
[1:52:27] hour in that we rise and have shone with
[1:52:31] the light of God. Are you listening?
[1:52:32] This is not to not to just energize you,
[1:52:35] not to emotionalize you, but this is ONE
[1:52:38] OF OUR GREATEST OPPORTUNITIES.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; When I hear all kinds of things TAKING
[1:52:45] PLACE, I SAY, "PRAISE GOD."
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT JESUS SAID? YOU KNOW WHAT
[1:52:50] JESUS SAID TO SCRIBES AND PHARISEES? GO
[1:52:52] AND FILL UP THE CUP OF YOUR FATHERS.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Fill it up. Get this thing over with.
[1:52:57] Whatever you're going to do, go and do
[1:52:59] it.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. DID IT CHANGE HIM? NOT A
[1:53:04] BIT.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said something that I
[1:53:08] want to be sure to get this. And I'm
[1:53:10] speaking now to many that might be on
[1:53:12] the internet and you're listening for
[1:53:15] whatever reason you're listening. I'm
[1:53:16] not too sure.
[1:53:18] But the prophet of God in this
[1:53:21] generation have been vindicated
[1:53:22] thousands of times. He said this, "You
[1:53:26] will remember these words on your
[1:53:28] deathbed
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; and you'll roll back and forth on your
[1:53:35] deathbed."
[1:53:37] And in your dying hour, you will hear my
[1:53:41] voice.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; And I say, "So be it
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; and thus it shall be." And if I were
[1:53:51] you, I if there's an ounce or a tinkle
[1:53:53] of of of GOD'S SPIRIT AT THIS MOMENT, I
[1:53:57] WOULD CRY OUT TO HIM.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY NOT be married. You may not be
[1:54:01] another one, BUT I WOULD CRY OUT TO HIM.
[1:54:03] AND I HAVE NEVER DONE THIS, BUT I WAS
[1:54:06] COMPELLED. And I told my wife yesterday,
[1:54:09] I'm going to speak to the people on the
[1:54:10] internet. You rejectors and you doubters
[1:54:13] of the word. If you're doubting the
[1:54:15] word, I WOULD CAST THAT OFF AND SAY,
[1:54:18] "GOD, DELIVER ME FROM THIS SPIRIT OF
[1:54:22] UNBELIEF. Deliver me." It didn't WORK
[1:54:26] FOR ANYONE THAT DISBELIEVED IN THE WORD
[1:54:28] OF GOD. AND IT WON'T BELIEVE FOR YOU. It
[1:54:31] won't work for you BEFORE YOU ARE BEFORE
[1:54:34] YOU COME TO THAT PLACE. He said, "You'll
[1:54:36] hear my voice."
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said further to the
[1:54:41] people, he said, "If you could only
[1:54:43] recognize
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; the voice,
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; not my voice, it's his voice.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; IF IT'S HIS VOICE, WHO IS IT? IT'S A
[1:54:52] HUSBAND." AND WHAT DOES THE HUSBAND
[1:54:53] HAVE? HE HAS SEED. AND HE'S JEALOUS OVER
[1:54:56] THAT SEED. HE'S JEALOUS OVER THAT SEED.
[1:55:00] And that seed's going to arrive to its
[1:55:02] right place.
[1:55:04] I have so much to say. Abraham had seed,
[1:55:07] had the right seed, BUT IT WOULDN'T WORK
[1:55:10] in Hagar.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; THE RIGHT SEED IN THE WRONG WOMB. And
[1:55:15] the word of God in THESE DENOMINATIONS
[1:55:17] WILL NOT WORK.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; WILL NOT WORK.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Say amen, folks.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; THIS RIGHT, THIS RIGHT SEED IN
[1:55:27] UNBELIEVING HEART WILL NOT WORK.
[1:55:31] AMEN.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; But the right seed in the right womb
[1:55:36] will bring forth in Isaac. The right
[1:55:38] seed in the right womb, the right seed,
[1:55:41] THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW CREATION of God
[1:55:43] in the Virgin Mary brought forth a child
[1:55:47] and a son unto us a son is given.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; And to think that that son grew up and
[1:55:56] returned in the end time
[1:55:58] and send a message your way.
[1:56:01] I don't know where you heard it. Well, I
[1:56:04] heard it from my mom and my dad. I
[1:56:06] didn't hear it from my mom and my dad,
[1:56:12] but I sat here where
[1:56:16] grace is sitting.
[1:56:19] And I saw the prophet of God talk to a
[1:56:23] woman
[1:56:25] with a blind girl
[1:56:28] about 12 years old, 10, 12 years old.
[1:56:32] And I thought, I I I want to really
[1:56:34] listen to this. I want to really hear
[1:56:36] this.
[1:56:37] I've never seen this before.
[1:56:40] And eyes of her eye her eyeballs are
[1:56:43] just white.
[1:56:45] And brother Brandham prays once. He
[1:56:47] looks at her twice, three, four times,
[1:56:49] five times, six times.
[1:56:52] She's just the same.
[1:56:55] Put his hand around her head,
[1:56:59] said, "Satan,
[1:57:02] an angel from God, gave this gift to me
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; and told me if I could get the people to
[1:57:08] believe that nothing would stand before
[1:57:10] my prayers, not even cancer."
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; And the people are here and they are
[1:57:14] believing. and I adjure you in the name
[1:57:17] of the living God to loose her and let
[1:57:18] her go. That time he just took her by
[1:57:20] the shoulders and turned her to the
[1:57:22] people and then lifted her up. Her eyes
[1:57:24] were as straight as mine.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; That anchored in my heart and I've never
[1:57:31] seen this before. THIS IS DIFFERENT.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; And I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THAT VOICE WAS
[1:57:38] SAYING. I want to know. AND IT IT WENT
[1:57:40] ON THROUGH and then people and then I
[1:57:43] hear all he's gone off and he believes
[1:57:46] the serpent's seed that Cain is the son
[1:57:48] of the serpent. Well, I know I had my
[1:57:50] disappointments. I didn't know. I didn't
[1:57:52] even know to baptize. Here I was
[1:57:55] preaching the gospel seven years
[1:57:57] preaching. I wasn't too sure if God was
[1:58:00] one or two or three. I wasn't sure about
[1:58:02] these things. Why am I saying this to
[1:58:05] you? Because there was something in me
[1:58:08] that was greater than disappointment.
[1:58:11] Something in you THAT'S GREATER THAN ALL
[1:58:14] YOUR FRIENDS. SOMETHING IN YOU THAT'S
[1:58:17] GREATER THAN ALL THIS DARKNESS.
[1:58:19] SOMETHING IN YOU THAT'S GREATER THAN ALL
[1:58:21] ALL THIS ON THE WEB.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; I SAY TO YOU IN THE NAME OF THE LORD,
[1:58:27] THOSE HEAVENS THAT HOLD THOSE VOICES,
[1:58:29] ALL THOSE DENIERS SHALL BE BURNED UP.
[1:58:34] AND ONE THING WILL REMAIN AND THAT IS
[1:58:37] THE VOICE OF GOD.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; UNTO YOU A SON IS GIVEN.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; UNTO YOU A BRIDEGROOM'S GIVEN
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; UNTO YOU. A VOICE IS GIVEN THAT HAS
[1:58:50] CALLED YOU OUT OF THIS DILEMMA.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; OUT OF THIS TERRIBLE STATE OF CONFUSION.
[1:58:56] COME TO PEACE, FRIENDS.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Come to peace.
[1:59:02] Come.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; I'm well aware.
[1:59:13] Some of you wrestled.
[1:59:15] Some of you wondered, but I said to you,
[1:59:17] come. Come. Just drop it. Come this
[1:59:21] morning.
[1:59:22] Come to his feet,
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[1:59:32] What an opportunity.
[1:59:35] It's not the church building. It's not
[1:59:37] the church name. It has nothing to do
[1:59:39] with it. We don't know anything of the
[1:59:42] house that Mary was in.
[1:59:45] We don't know anything of the
[1:59:48] We have never seen the alabaster box,
[1:59:50] but we have something.
[1:59:53] It's a life.
[1:59:57] A life.
[1:59:59] And with that life, we can go out and
[2:00:00] earn living and earn perhaps
[2:00:04] do well, live a good life.
[2:00:07] But when it's all over, what do we have?
[2:00:09] And so I pray, oh God,
[2:00:12] I don't know how you will deal with
[2:00:14] individuals.
[2:00:16] I don't know how you'll speak to them,
[2:00:19] but I prayed about this service, Lord.
[2:00:22] And I pray that somehow you'll speak
[2:00:24] very very very deep, not just to stir
[2:00:28] their hearts
[2:00:30] in a in a moment or an emotional moment,
[2:00:32] but that they might see the hour that
[2:00:35] we're in within the scope of this
[2:00:37] message, within the scope of the
[2:00:39] believers worldwide
[2:00:42] and where they are. Maybe some this is
[2:00:44] just a title on the church or a name and
[2:00:47] they they're believers of the message.
[2:00:49] But I pray, oh God, that there be a
[2:00:52] reality. Let the Holy Spirit give them a
[2:00:55] birth, oh God, in the word of God. Give
[2:00:58] them a birth, oh God. I pray in the name
[2:01:02] of Jesus Christ. Move every power of
[2:01:05] darkness. Move every confusion. MOVE
[2:01:09] EVERY DEMON FORCE OUT FROM THIS
[2:01:12] BUILDING, oh God. AND MAY MEN AND WOMEN
[2:01:15] RESPOND AS you would have them to
[2:01:17] respond, Lord. May they begin to have a
[2:01:21] relationship with you.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Me, you have not always.
[2:01:28] So Lord, I want to before I leave this
[2:01:30] pulpit today, I want to say that I love
[2:01:34] you.
[2:01:36] I wonder if we could have
[2:01:39] someone at the piano.
[2:01:51] I sat
[2:01:54] and I was singing,
[2:01:57] "I love him. I love him."
[2:02:01] when a voice spoke out,
[2:02:05] cried out, "YOU'LL NOT COMMIT SUICIDE,
[2:02:08] soldier boy."
[2:02:14] A day later, I met him.
[2:02:19] A day later, he was being prayed with.
[2:02:24] A day later, he was delivered.
[2:02:28] Friends, that God
[2:02:32] is present in this [music] building.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; I could not make it more more real to
[2:02:40] you.
[2:02:41] Let that God, maybe you've carried on,
[2:02:44] but you're not satisfied with your life
[2:02:47] and you know that you're not living
[2:02:49] where you ought to be.
[2:02:52] I want you to be man enough as w as Mary
[2:02:54] was woman enough to do what she didn't
[2:02:57] even understand.
[2:02:59] Maybe you'd like to stand. Maybe you'd
[2:03:01] like to come [music] and stand here
[2:03:03] forward as an evidence.
[2:03:05] I'm dedicating myself. I'm giving myself
[2:03:08] holy
[2:03:10] to this one.
[2:03:15] Maybe you'll sing it with me.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:03:33] [music]
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; We come
[2:03:37] to
[2:03:39] first
[2:03:41] love. [music]
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Salation. [music]
[2:04:02] [music]
[2:04:10] [music]
[2:04:13] I
[2:04:16] love him.
[2:04:19] I [music]
[2:04:22] love him
[2:04:27] [music and singing] because
[2:04:29] he
[2:04:33] love me [music and singing]
[2:04:39] and [music and singing]
[2:04:44] just smile.
[2:04:46] Salation. [music]
[2:04:53] [music]
[2:04:59] [music]
[2:05:03] There's someone else [music] who wants
[2:05:05] to come.
[2:05:07] [singing]
[2:05:09] [music]
[2:05:13] I [music]
[2:05:16] love
[2:05:20] [music]
[2:05:21] [singing]
[2:05:23] his word
[2:05:26] for [music]
[2:05:27] me
[2:05:32] and
[2:05:33] [music]
[2:05:34] her
[2:05:37] life. [music]
[2:05:40] Salation
[2:05:47] [music]
[2:05:54] [music]
[2:05:59] and a message here you [music] hear.
[2:06:02] I speak to you on the internet and
[2:06:04] perhaps some that are here. I trust not
[2:06:08] this message.
[2:06:10] will linger
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; with you
[2:06:14] as long as you live.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of opinion the
[2:06:19] person has about this Christ,
[2:06:22] this message
[2:06:24] will linger.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that he's made himself
[2:06:28] known to you? Aren't you glad he's come
[2:06:30] to your home? Aren't you glad he's come
[2:06:33] to your house?
[2:06:36] You might just be a teenager. You might
[2:06:38] be to someone in a in a in A CHRISTIAN
[2:06:40] HOME. AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU'RE IN THAT
[2:06:42] KIND OF a home?
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; I was just young fellas was your age.
[2:06:56] I was just young. A message like this
[2:06:59] stirred me [music] very very deep.
[2:07:03] Stirred me very very deep. That's when
[2:07:06] it started.
[2:07:08] Didn't start years later.
[2:07:15] I want you to be real respectful [music]
[2:07:17] now.
[2:07:22] I
[2:07:24] sing it, please.
[2:07:29] [music]
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; He was [music]
[2:07:45] first
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:07:56] [music]
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Purchase
[2:07:59] my
[2:08:01] Sal
[2:08:03] [music]
[2:08:08] [music]
[2:08:24] said I never see you again
[2:08:26] on this earth. Those words are just as
[2:08:29] real to me. I don't care when they were
[2:08:31] sad because the message lives on.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; And he said, "If this if you never see
[2:08:37] me again on this earth, remember in your
[2:08:39] dying hour, he may be gone and you may
[2:08:42] be still here. And those on the internet
[2:08:44] may still be listening. And I'm
[2:08:47] addressing you because I know you're
[2:08:49] there. God, witness to my heart that
[2:08:52] you'd be there."
[2:08:54] and these words
[2:08:57] in your dying hour
[2:09:00] this message will ech back and forth
[2:09:05] on your deathbed.
[2:09:08] Friends, I wouldn't
[2:09:10] I wouldn't risk that for anything.
[2:09:15] I'd say if I were you, where's my
[2:09:16] alabaster box?
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; And those of you that are believers,
[2:09:21] listen to me. Listen to me.
[2:09:24] In this hour, th this is this hour is
[2:09:28] similar to the one that Mary was in. He
[2:09:31] was on his way to a terrible end, a
[2:09:33] terrible crucifixion. He was on his way
[2:09:36] to what appeared to be obvious defeat.
[2:09:39] But the prophet said THIS WAS HIS
[2:09:41] GREATEST VICTORY BECAUSE NOW HIS ENTIRE
[2:09:44] MINISTRY was being crowned.
[2:09:47] Hallelujah.
[2:09:49] Listen, the very thing that you live for
[2:09:52] is is destined to be crowned.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Who wants to turn back? How many here
[2:10:00] want to see the change of their body?
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, brother. I want to see it. Some
[2:10:05] don't want it. I want to see your hand.
[2:10:08] You want it. You desire it.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; You're going to leave a lot of peers
[2:10:15] behind. We're not into an emotional
[2:10:17] thing. YOU'VE ALREADY RECEIVED THE SEED.
[2:10:20] SAY, "I'VE RECEIVED THAT SEED. I've
[2:10:22] received THAT WORD." HE SENT that
[2:10:24] personal message to me. It's a personal
[2:10:28] thing. I'M NOT PREACHING just to A
[2:10:30] CROWD. IT'S A PERSONAL MESSAGE TO ME.
[2:10:33] HALLELUJAH.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; like each one to pray with me. Going to
[2:10:45] pray for all these all of you that are
[2:10:47] standing here. I want you just to Hey,
[2:10:51] this is more than just a moment.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; This is a rare moment. A rare moment in
[2:10:58] time. I have to tell you, this is a
[2:11:01] glorious, glorious opportunity that you
[2:11:04] have, my brothers, my precious sisters.
[2:11:06] [music]
[2:11:07] A glorious opportunity you have.
[2:11:11] Heavenly Father, my father, my father,
[2:11:16] you that have sent your word seed,
[2:11:19] eternal life seed.
[2:11:22] Oh God, we don't want any of man's
[2:11:24] words, man's seed. We don't want
[2:11:27] anything that just has a time limit on
[2:11:30] it, but we want this eternal seed. Oh
[2:11:34] Jesus Christ, giver of life, author of
[2:11:38] life. You that gave yourself for us, a
[2:11:42] propitiation, a substitute for us. Come,
[2:11:45] oh God, we so desire to pour out our
[2:11:48] lives at your feet, to pour out all that
[2:11:52] we have. Oh God,
[2:11:56] grant us this moment, Lord. Grant us
[2:11:58] this moment in time as we express our
[2:12:01] love [music] to you. Oh lamb of God.
[2:12:06] Lamb of God, we love you. We love you.
[2:12:10] Oh, we love you Lord Jesus. We love you.
[2:12:14] We love you Lord. We love you Lord.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to sing him. We love
[2:12:23] you Lord. I love you Lord.
[2:12:26] Brother Derek, if you'd help us, help
[2:12:28] me, please. I love you, Lord.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; I love
[2:12:34] you, [singing and music] Lord. Let his
[2:12:36] voice as blend as one. And I
[2:12:44] [music]
[2:12:47] worship,
[2:12:50] [music]
[2:12:52] oh [singing] my soul.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Rejoice
[2:13:02] my king. [music]
[2:13:09] [music]
[2:13:13] Let it be a sweet [singing]
[2:13:16] sweet [music]
[2:13:20] in my ear. [music]
[2:13:26] Oh, I love [music]
[2:13:30] you, Lord. Receive Lord and I [music]
[2:13:36] th
[2:13:41] [music]

[2:20:48] Oh, to reflect [music]
[2:20:51] his grace,
[2:20:56] calling [music] the world to see
[2:21:03] love that will
[2:21:06] [music]
[2:21:07] others
[2:21:14] [music]
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; my Lord Lord Jesus,
[2:21:20] I know you will hear me as I pray from
[2:21:22] the very [music] depths of my heart.
[2:21:25] First, I want to thank you for all that
[2:21:27] have come and attended this morning.
[2:21:31] I thank you, Father,
[2:21:34] and pray that you'll go with Brother Tom
[2:21:36] and Joanne as they will leave for
[2:21:39] Seattle and be with the Saints in Reon.
[2:21:43] Pray, oh God, you'll be with the saints
[2:21:45] in Victoria.
[2:21:47] Now I pray for all of those that have
[2:21:50] streamed this service or ever will
[2:21:52] stream it. Lord, I pray if there is a
[2:21:57] twinge [music]
[2:21:58] of godliness
[2:22:00] within them
[2:22:03] that they will come to a major decision
[2:22:05] in their lives,
[2:22:08] a crossroad, and they will realize that
[2:22:10] the direction is without direction. The
[2:22:15] direction they're headed is in
[2:22:16] confusion.
[2:22:18] And as your prophet has already said,
[2:22:21] they will hear these words of this
[2:22:25] message till their dying day. [music]
[2:22:28] And Lord, for those of us that believe
[2:22:30] it,
[2:22:31] for those of us that have given
[2:22:33] ourselves to it, we want to say to you,
[2:22:36] oh Lord Jesus, you're worth all the
[2:22:39] world and more to us.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; You're more than life to us.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE OUR BREATH, OUR SUNSHINE.
[2:22:47] YOU'RE all in all AND WE GIVE YOU GLORY.
[2:22:50] We give you praise.
[2:22:52] Others may cast all kinds of things
[2:22:54] against you. We see nothing but
[2:22:57] perfection. You're the [music] perfect
[2:22:59] one, the holy one. You've called us,
[2:23:03] Lord. And we say today, we've heard your
[2:23:06] voice. I've heard your voice. You've
[2:23:08] called us and we've responded.
[2:23:11] So I thank you for all that are
[2:23:13] standing,
[2:23:15] all that are praying. I commit them to
[2:23:18] you now in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:23:20] Christ. You'll continue to speak and
[2:23:23] you'll continue to mold their lives
[2:23:27] to be instruments in your kingdom
[2:23:31] and to know that it will not be long.
[2:23:35] very very soon
[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; will be gathered in the kingdom of God
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; all all of this roar of life and this
[2:23:46] noise
[2:23:48] this pestilence and these evil things
[2:23:51] and these wars and calamities will be
[2:23:54] gone gone a distant
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; perhaps even not even in our memory
[2:23:59] anymore I trust not father and we will
[2:24:02] be in eternal joy Jo, eternal glory,
[2:24:07] united, married
[2:24:09] to the King of Kings. Oh, we bless your
[2:24:13] name, Lord. We bless your name. We bless
[2:24:16] your name, Jesus. I commit all of these
[2:24:19] to you.
[2:24:21] And as the people depart,
[2:24:24] pray that your presence will fill the
[2:24:27] automobile, their car,
[2:24:29] their rooms.
[2:24:31] And pray or bless the service.
[2:24:36] Services coming up Lord with brother
[2:24:37] Mohammed coming in the name of Jesus
[2:24:41] Christ. Amen. Amen.
[2:24:45] God bless you saints. God bless you.
[2:24:48] Wish we could shake [music] hands with
[2:24:49] each one of you.
[2:24:52] Hallelujah. Isn't it wonderful?
[2:24:57] If you want to just stand, we would just
[2:24:59] sing, we bless your name. We bless your
[2:25:01] name.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; We bless your name. [music] We're
[2:25:10] dismissed in Jesus name. We bless your
[2:25:14] name.
[2:25:17] We [music] give you [singing]
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; give you honor.
[2:25:24] Give [music] you praise.
[2:25:28] You are the life,
[2:25:33] [music] the truth, the way.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Truth, the way.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; We bless [music] your name.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; Bless your name.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; We bless your name. [music]
[2:25:47] Sing that again. I
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; I bless your name. [music]
[2:25:54] I bless your name.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; I give you all. [music]
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; I give you honor.
[2:26:04] Give you praise.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; You are the life,
[2:26:14] the truth, the way. [music]
[2:26:19] I bless your name.
[2:26:24] I bless [music]
[2:26:26] your name.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't want to ruin the
[2:26:31] atmosphere of the Holy Spirit, but
[2:26:34] somehow on our web page, different uh
[2:26:36] dates were given for services. There was
[2:26:38] just one service this weekend, so we
[2:26:41] don't want somebody showing up tonight,
[2:26:42] [music] and it got into October on a
[2:26:44] Thursday night. I don't know how that
[2:26:46] all happened, but brother Aaron was
[2:26:48] quick to correct the times and [music]
[2:26:50] and the times of the meeting.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; Did you say it was hacked?
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; No, I don't know who hacked it, but
[2:26:56] could have been one of our own people.
[2:26:57] something.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; But brother Aaron corrected it. So we
[2:27:03] want to thank brother Aaron.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Victory.
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; Victory [applause]
[2:27:12] over all the parts of darkness. Victory.
[2:27:15] Hallelujah.
[2:27:17] Maybe they get saved.
[2:27:20] Glory.
[2:27:22] We rejoice [music] in the midst of it.
[2:27:25] It doesn't bother me a bit. And I just
[2:27:27] say, "Praise God.
[2:27:31] Praise God." When the world's on fire,
[2:27:34] [music]
[2:27:36] I to be in God's vo.
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know where the hackers are
[2:27:42] going to be, but that's up to them.
[2:27:45] Praise the Lord. Praise the [music]
[2:27:47] Lord. Praise the Lord. You think I'm out
[2:27:49] of my mind. I am not out of my mind. I
[2:27:52] rejoice.
[2:27:55] People give me all kinds of sad news and
[2:27:57] I SAY, "PRAISE THE LORD."
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:28:01] What can defeat truth? Nothing. [music]
[2:28:04] Nothing. And they got a bag full of lies
[2:28:07] and want you to believe this bag full of
[2:28:09] lies. Praise the Lord.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; It only goes to [music] show they were
[2:28:14] listening
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; when I spoke to them
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; for the first time in [music] my life.
[2:28:20] Spoke to them. They were listening.
[2:28:23] Hallelujah.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So be it.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; Now say the same thing with the prophet.
[2:28:30] On their dying day, they'll roll back
[2:28:32] and forth [music] and this message will
[2:28:34] be echoing to them. They cannot get away
[2:28:37] from the message. [music]
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; EVEN THE ROMAN SOLDIERS AFTER IT was too
[2:28:44] late. Surely this was the son of God.
[2:28:47] Sorry fellas. Too late. should have seen
[2:28:51] it just ahead of time. We've seen it in
[2:28:53] time.
[2:28:55] Glory. Glory.
[2:28:58] What an opportunity to [music] rejoice.
[2:29:01] I'm serious. I'm full of it. Praise the
[2:29:04] Lord.
