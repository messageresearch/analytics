[0:27] him back and imprisoned him and when
[0:29] they did a trial was set and a sentence
[0:32] was
[0:33] made oh it was a terrible thing he had
[0:36] murdered the King's son and he knew what
[0:39] was coming to him they put him into the
[0:41] inner cells they locked the doors they
[0:43] put pads on it so no one in the guards
[0:45] around it because we know what kind of
[0:48] horrible punishment this boy was going
[0:49] to receive because he killed the King's
[0:52] son the royal king
[0:55] son guards is placed all around the
[0:57] doors he put an intersection stripping
[1:00] nothing but a loin cloth on there he was
[1:03] sat there in that condition starving

[1:09] in that condition then they brought him
[1:10] out to a trial he was found guilty and
[1:13] proven guilty a sentence was made that
[1:16] he is to be executed under horrible
[1:19] capital
[1:20] punishment he is to be killed by inches
[1:23] until his mortal life was gone sentenced
[1:25] by the
[1:26] judge he is to die and he begged and he
[1:29] he cried and he said though I am guilty
[1:33] though I am
[1:34] guilty I'm sorry that I did that I wish
[1:38] I had never done it I'm sorry that I did
[1:40] in a moment of a rage of temper I did it
[1:43] I didn't mean to do it that way one day
[1:45] the king went down to the place to visit
[1:47] the boy to tell him talk to him and tell
[1:52] him about killing his own son the only
[1:54] son he had he'd kill that boy he said
[1:56] I'm going down to talk to him and when
[1:58] he went down there he looked back in
[2:00] that cage like a caged in animal he saw
[2:04] his little skinny body laying back in
[2:06] the corner
[2:07] crying his face all sunk
[2:10] in Jaws sank back his eyes way back
[2:14] matter was all in his eyes and his mouth
[2:16] was all whed over no water thirsting
[2:21] laying back there on his face crying the
[2:23] king said stand up you come up to him
[2:26] you looked at him he said why did you
[2:28] kill my son
[2:30] what did my son do to you what did he do
[2:34] to marit such a death as you killed him
[2:36] stabbing him to death with the
[2:39] spirit he said nothing my Lord not one
[2:43] thing just my own imper just my own way
[2:47] I killed him because I was jealous of
[2:49] him and I got in a temper fit and I
