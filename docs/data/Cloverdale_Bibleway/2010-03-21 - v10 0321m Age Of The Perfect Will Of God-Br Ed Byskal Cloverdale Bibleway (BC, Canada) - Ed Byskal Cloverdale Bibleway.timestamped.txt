[7:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Welcome to the house of the Lord
[7:40] this morning.
[7:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[7:45] I know you love the Lord. He's in your
[7:48] midst. It's evident.
[7:51] His expression is expressed through you.
[7:53] And it's so good to see you this
[7:54] morning. It's so good to see him live
[7:57] through you.
[8:00] I want to sing
[8:02] I want to be holy righteous number 1060
[8:04] on the screen. Maybe just before we sing
[8:07] that, I'll give a couple of quick
[8:08] announcements.
[8:10] We don't have to interrupt the rest of
[8:12] the service at this point. Um if you had
[8:14] any lost in items from camp, they can be
[8:18] found in the fellowship room. They can
[8:20] be picked up uh between now and April
[8:23] 4th. After that, they'll be sent away to
[8:25] a needy country, I'm sure. Young
[8:27] people's choir is this afternoon at
[8:30] 3:30. So, if you're in Young People's
[8:32] Choir, make sure that you're here for
[8:34] that.
[8:36] And the nursery, for those of you that
[8:38] are moms that have little babies, the
[8:40] nursery is under renovation at this
[8:42] point, but they have the fellowship room
[8:44] set up for all the mothers that would
[8:46] need a nursery to be able to use that.
[8:48] So, dads, brothers, young people, make
[8:51] sure you stay out of the fellowship room
[8:52] as the moms will be using that as a
[8:55] nursery. For today,
[8:57] we have a new addition to the family of
[9:00] God, Caitlyn. An where's mom and dad
[9:04] Paula?
[9:06] Not here yet. This morning, all right.
[9:08] Well, it's awful new baby. So, she's
[9:11] born 7 lb 3 oz. Little baby girl. So, we
[9:15] want to congratulate brother Steve and
[9:16] sister Paula. Courtney this morning. I
[9:19] believe her mom is here from Edmonton.
[9:23] God bless you. And her dad is her uh
[9:27] actually Steve's dad, I think, is also
[9:30] here and mom. So, God bless you. That's
[9:32] the McCormick. So, if you see them, make
[9:35] sure you make them real welcome into the
[9:37] house of the Lord this morning.
[9:40] Where's Brother Matthew Dertie?
[9:43] How's that rib, brother Matthew?
[9:45] Perfect. Nobody noticed. Brother Matthew
[9:48] had a broken rib on Wednesday. He was
[9:49] standing in the parking lot. Had a
[9:52] couple of brothers lay hands on him and
[9:54] pray for him. I think he actually wrote
[9:55] who they were here. Brother Ben Drake,
[9:58] Brother Jim Miller, and the Lord
[10:01] miraculously touched him
[10:03] &gt;&gt; and healed his rib. Matthew wants to
[10:05] give praise to the Lord this morning.
[10:10] Amen.
[10:11] [Music]
[10:13] Take courage this morning. The Kurtie
[10:16] family has miracle after miracle after
[10:18] miracle. They're still coming, brother
[10:20] Matthew. Amen. God bless you this
[10:22] morning. Why don't we stand and sing
[10:25] this together?
[10:28] Our God is a holy God and he dwells
[10:30] amongst
[10:32] holy people.
[10:35] Amen.
[10:37] You want to help me out right?
[10:40] I want to be holy,
[10:47] rightous
[10:50] in your image,
[10:54] in your likeness.
[10:57] For you are holy.
[11:01] You are faithful and true. Oh my Jesus,
[11:08] I want to be like you. I want to be
[11:14] holy.
[11:16] [Music]
[11:22] Holy.
[11:28] There's a year.
[11:32] There's a cry.
[11:35] There's a burning
[11:39] deep inside.
[11:43] There's a longing
[11:47] only you can set
[11:51] this fire
[11:57] in your presence.
[12:00] Have you stayed?
[12:03] Hallelujah.

[20:01] Lord, making what you've done real to
[20:04] the hearts of your children.

[20:52] and touch the master this morning. We
[20:54] have loved ones. We have unsaved ones.
[20:57] We have those that are far from God. We
[20:59] have those that are streaming that feel
[21:01] just as much a part of this service as
[21:03] you do, the redeemed of the Lord,
[21:05] sitting here this morning. And they need
[21:07] us to pull on the word because they're

[31:08] in the cross.
[31:11] In the cross
[31:14] be my glory
[31:17] ever
[31:20] till my rapured soul shall find
[31:26] rest beyond the river
[31:30] [Music]
[31:32] till my rapured soul shall find sweet
[31:40] Rest beyond
[31:43] the river.
[31:48] [Applause]

[33:25] In my darkest hour, you're my hiding
[33:30] place
[33:32] for the ancient of days.

[36:55] Blessed be
[36:59] blessed be
[37:02] blessed be your name.
[37:10] Halleluah.
[37:13] Blessed be his name.
[37:19] Blessed be his name.
[37:25] Matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[37:28] The scripture tells us that all things
[37:31] are done in his name.
[37:35] The prophet tells us that in his
[37:37] presence the supernatural is happening.
[37:41] I wonder if we could stand once again.
[37:47] [Music]
[37:49] As humans, we always are needy
[37:54] and we need the supernatural
[37:57] &gt;&gt; amongst us.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; We have I have I have Sister Elizabeth
[38:03] Das. I have you on my heart today.
[38:08] She's here. Perhaps a lot of people may
[38:11] have stayed home, but she's got severe
[38:14] pain,
[38:16] knees swelling.
[38:18] They say it's arthritis. We have a God
[38:21] that's greater than arthritis.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; So, I just pray that God will dispense
[38:28] with the arthritis
[38:31] &gt;&gt; in his presence. Amen.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; And sister Sue Aguary, I just heard of
[38:36] Brother Phil's need
[38:39] and terrible condition with I've never
[38:42] even heard of it with shingles behind
[38:44] the eye.
[38:46] And shingles are very, very painful.
[38:49] Sister Sue, go and tell Phil Forest,
[38:52] would you please? God is greater than
[38:54] the shingles
[38:57] and your congregation of people.
[39:01] And when the prophet said that people
[39:03] are raising their hand and coming to God
[39:06] in unison and unity and if one chase a
[39:09] thousand and two 10,000 what about a
[39:12] congregation like this? Hallelujah.
[39:15] [Applause]
[39:17] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; He's greater than all of these things.
[39:23] Greater than cancer, greater than
[39:25] diabetes,
[39:27] greater than all of these things. and we
[39:30] bring your affliction,
[39:32] whether it be physical or spiritual or
[39:34] any other emotional, we bring it to him.
[39:37] And I know we've already prayed, but I'd
[39:39] just like to have you join with me in
[39:41] prayer before we come to the word.
[39:44] Oh, Father Jehovah Gyra,
[39:49] &gt;&gt; the provider, our provider. You've
[39:52] provided all that we have need of and
[39:55] more.
[39:56] You're the creator of heavens and earth
[39:58] and you've made all things. And we're
[40:01] praying, oh God, for our brother Philari
[40:04] today, Lord. And my heart was so touched
[40:06] as I heard yesterday of his affliction.
[40:09] Smite this affliction, oh God. And may
[40:12] it begin to subside as of now, oh God.
[40:16] And may he be delivered from this
[40:18] affliction. Our sister Elizabeth Diaz is
[40:22] here. Oh God, remove, I pray, oh Father,
[40:25] this arthritic condition and swelling of
[40:29] the knees and may she walk for the glory
[40:32] of God and many other needs that are
[40:35] amongst us. Lord, our brother Daryl, oh
[40:38] God, how we're standing firm with him.
[40:40] You spoke to him and touched him. Lord,
[40:42] you've touched me. Father, you've
[40:45] touched brother John Lei. Oh God, you've
[40:48] touched so many that are here. We give
[40:50] you glory. We give you praise. You're
[40:53] the almighty one, the God of Abraham, of
[40:57] God of Isaac, and God of Jacob. You're
[40:59] the God of the living and not of the
[41:01] dead. We give you praise, Lord. We give
[41:04] you praise. And all out on the internet
[41:06] congregation, oh God. Let them stand in
[41:09] their rooms and wherever they are. And
[41:12] may they be delivered and healed,
[41:14] Father, by the power of the resurrected
[41:17] Christ. For you are the same yesterday,
[41:20] today, and forever. You're the mighty I
[41:24] am. Not I was or will be, but you are
[41:28] today, Lord. We thank you. We thank you.
[41:32] Thank you, Lord.
[41:34] Thank you, Lord. And now touch us as we
[41:38] turn to your word. Father, give us a
[41:41] spirit of revelation upon us, Lord.
[41:44] Spirit of adoption, oh God. Bring us
[41:47] into a maturity Lord where we will have
[41:51] understanding in your word I pray and
[41:53] take it to heart in Jesus name.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; In Jesus name. In Jesus name.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I wonder if we could
[42:05] maybe just sing thank you Jesus. Thank
[42:08] you
[42:10] [Music]
[42:13] Jesus.
[42:14] [Music]
[42:17] for the things that you have done for
[42:22] us.
[42:25] Oh, I can
[42:28] love that you have given me life.
[42:32] Thank you,
[42:35] Lord.
[42:39] Thank
[42:40] you. Thank you, Jesus. Jesus
[42:45] [Music]
[42:47] for the things that you have done for
[42:51] us.
[42:54] Oh, I can't repain the love that you
[42:58] have given me.
[43:01] Thank you,
[43:04] Lord.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:10] If you'd like to join with me in reading
[43:13] and turn to the scripture in second
[43:16] Peter
[43:19] the 3 chapter.
[43:22] And while you're turning, we want to say
[43:25] the baptism we're going to have tonight.
[43:29] Our young sister Brooke Bismouth is
[43:33] going to be baptized. And I don't know
[43:35] who else might want to be baptized if
[43:38] they've never been baptized in the name
[43:39] of the Lord Jesus Christ and baptized
[43:43] into this word. That's the baptism that
[43:46] we believe in and do. So thankful for
[43:49] the young men, young women, young people
[43:53] and the meetings and the after effect of
[43:56] the camp meetings. Remember when you
[43:59] have a meeting with God, it doesn't end
[44:02] with camp. Amen.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't end with a good service.
[44:06] You just keep pressing on.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Good to hear you pray, John.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Brother John has been here since been a
[44:13] young boy. It's wonderful to see the
[44:17] different ones have prayed. I was so
[44:20] moved as I heard, you know, the
[44:22] different ones pray and and lead in
[44:25] part. It's your it's your turn now. We
[44:28] want to greet those on the streaming
[44:31] congregation. We have a nice
[44:33] congregation
[44:34] here, but there's many more and uh uh
[44:39] possibly hundreds of people that are
[44:42] streaming. And we want to say God bless
[44:44] you. Uh once in a while, just
[44:46] occasionally I look to see where they're
[44:49] streaming from. Generally about 25
[44:53] countries and perhaps even more I think
[44:56] of and I look at them every once in a
[44:58] while. I see them throughout the uh
[45:00] Europe nations,
[45:02] United Kingdom and and France and
[45:06] Belgium and Holland and Norway and into
[45:09] Russia and the Ukraine and Poland down
[45:12] through many nations in Africa. And
[45:15] they're here with us. They're streaming
[45:17] and we say God bless you
[45:20] &gt;&gt; down into New Zealand and Singapore,
[45:22] Argentina, Peru, Bolivia,
[45:25] uh, Brazil, uh, Mexico. My, there are
[45:28] just so many down on the islands of the
[45:30] sea. So, we just say God bless them
[45:33] &gt;&gt; immensely and I trust that they will
[45:36] have a a wonderful,
[45:39] joyous time with the word today.
[45:42] You've been enjoying the future home.
[45:46] That's good.
[45:49] You're not enjoying it near as much as
[45:50] you're going to when you get there.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; We'll start to read
[45:59] second Peter the 3 chapter
[46:04] starting at the first verse.
[46:08] This second epistle, beloved, I now
[46:10] write unto you in both which I stir up
[46:12] your pure minds by way of remembrance,
[46:16] that you may be mindful of the words
[46:18] which were spoken before by the holy
[46:20] prophets and of the commandment of us
[46:22] the apostles of the Lord and Savior.
[46:27] Knowing this first, that there shall
[46:29] come in the last days scoffers walking
[46:31] after their own lust and saying, "Where
[46:33] is the promise of his coming? For since
[46:36] the fathers fell asleep, all things
[46:38] continue as they were from the beginning
[46:40] of the creation. For this they willingly
[46:43] are ignorant of that by the word of God
[46:46] the heavens were of old and the earth
[46:49] standing out of the water and in the
[46:51] water whereby the world that then was
[46:54] being overflowed with water perished.
[46:57] But the heavens and the earth, which are
[46:59] now by the same word, are kept in store,
[47:02] reserved under fire, against the day of
[47:04] judgment and predition of ungodly men.
[47:08] But beloved, be not ignorant of this one
[47:11] thing, that one day is with the Lord as
[47:14] a thousand years, and a thousand years
[47:16] as one day. The Lord is not slack
[47:18] concerning his promise, as some men
[47:21] count slackness, but is long-suffering
[47:23] to usward, not willing that any should
[47:26] perish, but that all should come to
[47:28] repentance. But the day of the Lord
[47:30] shall come as a thief in the night, in
[47:33] which the heavens shall pass away with a
[47:35] great noise, and the elements shall melt
[47:37] with fervent heat. the earth also and
[47:39] the works that are therein shall be
[47:42] burned up. Seeing then that all these
[47:44] things shall be dissolved. What manner
[47:48] what manner of persons ought ye to be in
[47:52] all holy conversation and godliness
[47:55] looking for and hastening unto the
[47:57] coming of the day of God wherein the
[47:59] heavens being on fire shall be
[48:01] dissolved. Any element shall melt with
[48:03] fervent heat. Nevertheless, we according
[48:06] to his promise look for new heavens and
[48:09] a new earth wherein dwelleth
[48:11] righteousness. And we say amen. God
[48:14] bless you as you have your seats.
[48:22] Just as a little prelude to the message,
[48:27] I want to say to you as a as a
[48:29] congregation, as a pastor, as a friend,
[48:33] as a brother in Christ, we are taught
[48:37] and we believe
[48:40] that God has sent
[48:43] uh his prophet
[48:46] and messenger.
[48:49] I want to think of that word for a
[48:51] moment. his messenger
[48:53] with remarkable vindication
[48:57] because the message was critical and
[49:00] urgent and important.
[49:03] I would like to say that the message we
[49:06] refer to the message so many times but I
[49:10] want to emphasize and impress you deeply
[49:14] today that brother Brandham was sent and
[49:17] a messenger means to give an
[49:20] announcement
[49:21] or it is actually a one sent forth with
[49:27] orders.
[49:29] He wasn't here for his own choosing. He
[49:33] was here with orders. He was sent with
[49:35] orders.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; And you and I are privileged to hear
[49:40] those orders.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; So this is not a you know
[49:48] just a hoham
[49:50] church or doctrine. Right.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; This is uh one that has been that has
[49:55] been received by a messenger, an
[49:58] announcing messenger.
[50:00] Here are some of the announcements.
[50:04] This is the last age.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; This is the last church age
[50:11] &gt;&gt; and the messenger always comes at the
[50:13] end of the age.
[50:15] This is the messenger
[50:18] &gt;&gt; because he's been proven by a multitude
[50:21] of vindications.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; This is the calling out of the bride.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; It's not something happened hundreds of
[50:30] years ago. It's happening now.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; And we have received the last signs.
[50:37] Think of it. We have received the sign
[50:41] of the Messiah. Yes.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; We have received the sign of the
[50:46] resurrection.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Just think of it. We talk about a
[50:49] resurrection, but we have seen the sign
[50:52] of the resurrection. It's on tape. You
[50:54] can hear it. And when you hear that
[50:56] vindication, you say, "I'm hearing the
[50:59] sign of the resurrection."
[51:03] &gt;&gt; This messenger has said that the bride
[51:05] will be the final age, the final voice
[51:09] to the final age. And if you are a bride
[51:12] and you believe that, then you have to
[51:16] declare and confess God has sent the
[51:19] most vindicated, proven messenger to
[51:22] tell me and announce to me that this is
[51:26] the final voice and I'm a part of that
[51:28] final voice to the final age.
[51:33] Amen.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; It's only right that this kind of
[51:36] messenger
[51:38] would be the one who would tell us about
[51:42] the future home.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Not just the future home, but the future
[51:48] home of the heavenly bridegroom
[51:50] &gt;&gt; and the earthly bride.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Our eternal home. This messenger has
[51:58] been sent to tell us of these things
[52:03] in the message of future home and many
[52:05] of you have been reading it and I'm so
[52:07] thankful for that. There are there are
[52:10] three things that I would like to draw
[52:12] your attention to
[52:14] and and and brother Brown speaks of all
[52:17] three of them but I would like to stitch
[52:21] them together.
[52:23] Excuse me.
[52:25] He speaks of three stages of the earth.
[52:29] I'm not preaching yet. We're just
[52:30] starting to set a little base
[52:32] foundation. Three stages of the earth.
[52:35] But the last stage he he speaks clearly
[52:39] that it that that speaks of eternity.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Not the millennium, but eternity.
[52:46] Then he speaks of then he breaks off
[52:48] from that and goes into the Old
[52:50] Testament to Leviticus the 23rd chapter.
[52:53] And those you had been reading it will
[52:54] recall now these are things you've read.
[52:57] And he goes into the Old Testament goes
[53:00] to the 23rd chapter of Leviticus which
[53:03] speaks of the seven feasts. The seven
[53:05] feasts and he goes to the last feast.
[53:09] Said now this is the feast of
[53:10] tabernacles
[53:12] which is a dwelling places. It speaks of
[53:15] the changing of the body. And he goes to
[53:18] that. But he says now the last day of
[53:22] that feast was the eighth day and there
[53:25] is no eighth day. There's only seven
[53:28] because the eighth day speaks of
[53:30] eternity.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; So when he speaks of the world, he takes
[53:34] it to eternity. When he starts now to
[53:37] speak of the last feast, he takes it and
[53:39] shows from the Old Testament, it blends
[53:41] right into eternity. And then he takes
[53:44] and speaks also of the wave sheath which
[53:48] happened after Jesus was resurrected
[53:50] from the dead. And he said he was waved
[53:53] over the people because he was the first
[53:56] one that come to full maturity. And he
[53:59] was waved over the people as a memorial
[54:02] to God that there's more like him in the
[54:06] field.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; And you were in the field. You were
[54:11] laying in the field of the earth when
[54:14] Jesus Christ was waved over the people.
[54:17] And the Bible says the prophet brings
[54:20] out from the scripture that he was he he
[54:24] was it was waved as a memorial that
[54:26] there were more like him in the field
[54:28] and that they would come. There were
[54:30] more like him that would come forth. And
[54:33] I want to say to you now before we start
[54:35] preaching and here we are. Right?
[54:39] &gt;&gt; It's this God who brought us forth
[54:42] &gt;&gt; and he sent Elijah with all the
[54:44] vindication and all the proof and
[54:46] something that would speak to that seed
[54:48] that you have in you because that also
[54:51] was eternal life seed and that's the
[54:54] only thing that could quicken it was was
[54:57] the spirit of God. Isn't it wonderful?
[55:00] Amen.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; And we we took and started last
[55:05] Wednesday.
[55:07] Thy our heaven our heavenly father, thy
[55:11] kingdom come, thy will be done. Our
[55:14] father which art in heaven, hallowed be
[55:17] thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be
[55:20] done. What I've just spoken to you now
[55:23] is the consummation of his will. Thy
[55:27] will be done. Thy desire. What he
[55:29] desires is not that we're sitting here
[55:31] fighting with the world. That he's
[55:33] allowed that, but his desire is that
[55:36] he'll take his children to his home.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Thy will be done. This is his will. His
[55:45] will is his desires, his ambitions, his
[55:48] his objective. What he takes pleasure
[55:51] in. He doesn't take pleasure even in the
[55:53] death of the wicked. He doesn't take
[55:55] pleasure in all the wars and the
[55:57] fighting and all the things that we even
[56:00] uh we have we scrape with every day. We
[56:03] rub rub shoulders with every day and
[56:05] we're bombarded with every day. He
[56:07] doesn't take pleasure in that. He takes
[56:09] pleasure that he's delivered us from it.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; So that will be the age of the perfect
[56:18] will of God. What I'm speaking of now is
[56:21] the age of the perfect will of God.
[56:25] So now it's it is absolutely
[56:30] so important. I I I even fail to find
[56:33] words to express how important it is
[56:35] that we discern the hour that we're
[56:38] living in and who we are.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; That God has called you for this time
[56:43] and for this season. And as Jesus said
[56:48] to Jerusalem, if thou hast known even
[56:51] thou, at least in this thy day, at least
[56:56] in this thy day, the things which belong
[56:59] unto thy peace, but now they are hid
[57:02] from thy eyes. And then he goes on as
[57:04] for the days. Notice he said if you had
[57:07] known this day, but he said the days
[57:08] shall come upon thee that thine enemies
[57:12] shall cast a trench about thee and
[57:15] compass thee about and keep thee on
[57:17] every side and shall lay thee even with
[57:20] the ground and thy children within thee.
[57:23] And they shall not leave uh in thee one
[57:26] stone upon another because thou kneest
[57:29] not the time of thy visitation. We this
[57:33] this uh generation this age has had a
[57:38] time of most unusual vindication and
[57:42] visitation.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; This is our day
[57:46] &gt;&gt; when God has visited us.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; And even as Tommy Osbborne said of
[57:49] brother Brennham's uh memorial, he said,
[57:52] "I know I'll be misunderstood for this,
[57:54] but he said God walked amongst us
[57:56] again."
[57:57] &gt;&gt; And he says, and mark my word, this
[58:00] won't happen again. I tell you what, I
[58:03] don't know what what other things he has
[58:05] preached. I've heard many things. Uh
[58:07] I've heard a number of sermons of
[58:09] brother Osborne when he was uh
[58:11] ministering and brother Brown spoke
[58:13] highly of him. But I can tell you he was
[58:15] ordained of God to say those things.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; God walked amongst us
[58:21] &gt;&gt; and he will not do it again because it
[58:24] needed to have that kind of significance
[58:26] so that we would realize the hour that
[58:29] we're in. And as I said earlier on
[58:32] Wednesday that they Jesus said the
[58:35] children of the world are wiser in their
[58:38] generation in their time. They pick up
[58:41] on things quick real quickly. We find
[58:44] our children and and the educational
[58:46] world and they pick up on things real
[58:48] quick and and they they major on it and
[58:51] they build on it and they advance and
[58:53] they go further with it. And uh we don't
[58:56] want to we don't want to be that way
[58:57] spiritually. Um, I mean, we don't want
[59:00] to be slack spiritually. We want to in
[59:03] the message countdown, my there's so
[59:05] many things going through my mind,
[59:06] you'll have to just try to stay with me.
[59:08] But in the message countdown, Brother
[59:10] Brandham takes the advancement of the
[59:12] world and shows that the church has
[59:13] advanced right along with it. But we
[59:15] don't want to be slack in the in the
[59:18] advancement of the church and the
[59:20] advancement of what's happened. Look,
[59:22] look at what God has sent. And yet,
[59:24] there's so many multitudes that they
[59:26] don't only deny it. They don't want to
[59:27] have anything to do with it.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; To them, it seems like it's
[59:30] old-fashioned. And it's so advanced,
[59:32] they can't even grasp it.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; I can tell you, Brother Brandham spoke
[59:35] things that were so advanced in science,
[59:38] in in medicine, in uh botney life, in
[59:42] all fields of science. He's so advanced.
[59:45] [Music]
[59:47] &gt;&gt; How would you like many, many years ago
[59:49] saying, "There's voices going through
[59:50] here right now. There's colors going
[59:52] through this room right now. There's
[59:53] bodies going through this room. That's
[59:55] right.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Figure that one out.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; That's not not some strange off-the-wall
[1:00:01] doctrine. That's exactly true.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Science could prove it."
[1:00:05] And so you have a radio, you have a
[1:00:07] signal, you have a television, it proves
[1:00:08] some of these things.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; So the messenger to the people of this
[1:00:12] day, one sent with orders
[1:00:16] in the message Elisha the prophet. I I I
[1:00:19] just want to I want to
[1:00:23] identify some things in these quotes. It
[1:00:25] might be quite long, but hang on to the
[1:00:26] essence of the quote because I'm on a
[1:00:29] very specific theme. Brother Brandham,
[1:00:31] now I'm on a on this theme of knowing
[1:00:34] the time that you're in. He knew the
[1:00:36] time. He had to know the time that he
[1:00:38] was in.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; All right? And in Brother Brandham's
[1:00:41] ministry, you'll find that um uh you'll
[1:00:45] find that his ministry was such it was
[1:00:47] progressive. The revelation was
[1:00:49] progressive. And uh and so the unveiling
[1:00:53] to us is progressive. He says, "Now down
[1:00:56] through the age, now this is this is
[1:00:58] 1956
[1:01:01] down through the age." He said, "You
[1:01:03] come." He's speaking now in prayer. You
[1:01:05] come and vindicated yourself. How we can
[1:01:08] see David climbing the mountain and
[1:01:10] looking back over Jerusalem and rejected
[1:01:13] by his own. And he wept as he went up
[1:01:16] the mount. And just a few hundred years
[1:01:19] after that, we see the son of David
[1:01:22] rejected and sitting on the same
[1:01:25] mountain saying, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
[1:01:27] how oft you and hovered over you as a
[1:01:30] hen with her chicks, but you would not
[1:01:33] if you'd only known your day of
[1:01:34] visitation."
[1:01:36] And he says, "And dear father tonight,"
[1:01:40] now this 1956, "and dear father, tonight
[1:01:43] my heart I feel the Holy Spirit crying
[1:01:46] out, oh now there's a messenger
[1:01:50] announcing, oh America,
[1:01:53] America, how oft
[1:01:56] would the Holy Spirit have given you the
[1:01:58] real outpouring
[1:02:01] of a revival? how he would have gathered
[1:02:04] you and held you in safety. But I
[1:02:07] believe you didn't understand the day of
[1:02:10] your visitation. You scorned the
[1:02:12] prophets. You called them fanatics and
[1:02:15] you put them in jail.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Then in 1961
[1:02:22] in sers we would see Jesus. He said,
[1:02:24] "I'm praying, fasting, and waiting on
[1:02:28] God. I want to do my part while I'm here
[1:02:31] in California. You do your part. God is
[1:02:34] doing greater things today than he ever
[1:02:37] than ever has been known since Jesus
[1:02:39] Christ was on earth. And it's going
[1:02:41] right over the top of the people's head.
[1:02:43] What's he saying? They still don't
[1:02:45] understand the day of their visitation.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And they're missing it."
[1:02:51] He said, "That's the bad part. if they'd
[1:02:53] only known it like Jesus. If you'd known
[1:02:56] your day, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how
[1:02:58] often I would have hovered over you as a
[1:03:00] hen does her brood. But you would not if
[1:03:03] you would have only known your day of
[1:03:06] visitation. He said, "That's the way it
[1:03:08] is today. It's always been and that's
[1:03:11] the way that's what it is now. if we' if
[1:03:14] we'd have only known the day of
[1:03:17] visitation. But the visitation goes
[1:03:19] right through and the people are looking
[1:03:21] way over here for something else and the
[1:03:24] first thing you know the visitation's
[1:03:26] over and there it is. That's why I'm
[1:03:29] rejoicing so much tonight that we have
[1:03:32] caught the voice of the visitation.
[1:03:34] We've caught and heard the voice of the
[1:03:37] announcement. Our hearts are moved. Our
[1:03:40] whole soul is stirred because it's not
[1:03:43] just a service for us. It's not just a
[1:03:45] church for us. We've heard it and we've
[1:03:47] received it as a messenger from God with
[1:03:51] an announcement that this is this is
[1:03:53] what's happening. And we're saying, "Oh
[1:03:55] God, cause me to be alert.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Oh God, let me be fully at attention.
[1:04:02] Let me be ready to receive this as a
[1:04:05] voice from God."
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; In the choosing of the bride. Now we go
[1:04:12] to 1965. I'm just moving you
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; through the prophet's ministry because
[1:04:18] this is what this is. That's why I I
[1:04:21] came at first to say he came with an
[1:04:23] announcement.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; These people missed it. 56 missed it.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; 61 missed it. 63 65 missed it.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Let's not us miss it.
[1:04:36] [Applause]
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Men were soon going into future home. He
[1:04:41] said that solemn that's solemn warning
[1:04:44] cuz he had just spoken some comments and
[1:04:47] I always read before it. He said, "We
[1:04:49] don't know what time." Notice that the
[1:04:51] time we don't know what time and you
[1:04:54] don't know what time that the city one
[1:04:58] day is going to be laying out here in
[1:05:03] the bottom of this ocean.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; This is an announcement.
[1:05:08] It's not just something that you know he
[1:05:10] spilled out of his lips. This is an
[1:05:12] announcement. This city will be laying
[1:05:15] out here at the bottom of this ocean.
[1:05:19] Oh, Capernium. He said Jesus said Jesus,
[1:05:23] thou exalted into heaven will be brought
[1:05:26] down into hell. For if the mighty works
[1:05:29] had been done in Sodom and Gomorrah, it
[1:05:31] would have been standing till this day.
[1:05:33] And Sodom and Gomorrah lays at the
[1:05:35] bottom of the Dead Sea. And Capernaum's
[1:05:38] at the bottom of the sea. And thou city
[1:05:42] who claims to be the city of angels, uh,
[1:05:45] Los Angeles, he said, you exalted
[1:05:48] yourself into heaven, they got their
[1:05:50] stars, their fallen stars, wicked stars.
[1:05:55] and you that have exalted yourself into
[1:05:57] the heavens and have have and and and
[1:05:59] and have sent your filth, he said,
[1:06:01] you've picked up your filth and sent it
[1:06:03] away with your fine churches and your
[1:06:06] staples. You're still religious, you
[1:06:08] see, and so forth the way you do.
[1:06:10] Remember, one day you'll be laying at
[1:06:12] the bottom of the sea. You great
[1:06:15] honeycomb
[1:06:17] under you. Your great honeycomb under
[1:06:20] you right now. The wrath of God is
[1:06:23] belching right beneath you. How much
[1:06:25] longer he'll hold this sandbar hanging
[1:06:28] over that when that ocean out yonder a
[1:06:31] mile deep will slide in there plum back
[1:06:34] to the salt and sea. It'll be worse than
[1:06:37] the days of Pompei. Repent. Los Angeles.
[1:06:41] Repent. The rest of you and turn to God.
[1:06:44] The hour of his wrath is upon the earth.
[1:06:47] flee while there's time to flee and come
[1:06:50] into Christ.
[1:06:52] [Applause]
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be around when that
[1:06:57] happens.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; I can just tell you right now, they the
[1:07:02] world think they had a meltdown. They
[1:07:05] have no meltdown like it's coming.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; And I want to be in Christ.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; I want to be fully in Christ.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:17] Mori said to Esther,
[1:07:21] "For if thou altogether holdest thy
[1:07:23] peace at this time,"
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; that's her time.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Then shall there be an enlargement and
[1:07:31] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[1:07:33] another place.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; I would say to the bride from another
[1:07:36] place,
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; but thou and thy father's house shall be
[1:07:39] destroyed. And who knoweth, who knoweth
[1:07:42] whether thou art come to the kingdom for
[1:07:44] such a time as this?
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; I say to you young people, I say to this
[1:07:49] congregation, I say to those that are
[1:07:51] streaming, who knoweth?
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; God knows that we have come to the
[1:07:55] kingdom for such a time as this. And
[1:07:57] that's why God sends this kind of a
[1:08:00] messenger, sends this kind of a prophet,
[1:08:02] sends this kind of vindication. That's
[1:08:04] why he himself came and stood at the
[1:08:06] pull pit at the platform service after
[1:08:09] service whether it be uh Durban, South
[1:08:12] Africa or Bombay or Houston, Texas or
[1:08:16] Dawson Creek or Edmonton or Saskatoon or
[1:08:20] Chicago or wherever it was that was that
[1:08:23] pillar fire came there so that we
[1:08:26] wouldn't miss it.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; So that we wouldn't miss the day of
[1:08:29] visitation. That's why it all happened.
[1:08:33] That's why that's why men come like
[1:08:35] brother Diggs. That's why men come and
[1:08:37] that as brother Tom will preach tonight,
[1:08:39] brother John taking services as myself,
[1:08:42] other men of God who are ministering to
[1:08:44] the bride of Jesus Christ with such an
[1:08:46] urgency.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Some may minister for different reasons,
[1:08:51] but I'm not here for another reason. I'm
[1:08:54] here to expend all the energy and all
[1:08:56] the vision and burden that I have for
[1:08:59] you that are here, dear loved ones and
[1:09:02] friends.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; We've been called for such a time as
[1:09:07] this. He says of the church, the church
[1:09:09] and recognize the day in his message.
[1:09:11] The church has not recognized her day.
[1:09:14] Recognize the day of the evening time.
[1:09:16] It's here. It's not coming. The evening
[1:09:19] time is here. And it's here to vindicate
[1:09:22] the coming of Christ. And we're at the
[1:09:24] end. Recognize your day.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; One of the most significant times in all
[1:09:31] of history
[1:09:33] when one span of time blended into
[1:09:36] another.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; He talks about the church ages. One
[1:09:39] blends into the other.
[1:09:42] And once again, a messenger is sent at a
[1:09:46] specific time. And brother Brandham was
[1:09:49] sent here at this time when time would
[1:09:52] blend into eternity. And that's why he
[1:09:55] had to go into this message. He never
[1:09:57] spoke future home a dozen times. As far
[1:10:00] as I know, he spoke it once.
[1:10:03] And he takes you into the three stages
[1:10:04] of the earth going into eternity. He
[1:10:07] takes you into the eighth day taking you
[1:10:09] into eternity. He takes us into the wave
[1:10:12] sheath which takes right into eternity.
[1:10:14] That is the whole theme of that message.
[1:10:16] I I need I need to set this before you
[1:10:19] as we move on into it. But now just
[1:10:22] quickly, there's been some fullnesses of
[1:10:24] times when something when something
[1:10:25] comes to its fullness and then and then
[1:10:28] it's as Jesus said your day, oh
[1:10:32] Jerusalem, Jerusalem, if you'd only
[1:10:34] known your day of visitation. But now
[1:10:36] it's gone.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Now something else is going to happen.
[1:10:39] An era has passed. Hear the word of God.
[1:10:41] I came and walked among you. God in
[1:10:44] flesh, the fullness of the Godhead. I
[1:10:46] walked among you, did all manner of
[1:10:48] healings, sent the word and and healed
[1:10:50] the people and did all manner of
[1:10:53] miracles, but now it's gone. In other
[1:10:55] words, like Tommy Osborne said, you're
[1:10:56] not going to see this again.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; You're not going to see it like this.
[1:11:00] But now this era has passed.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; And uh
[1:11:06] Jerusalem and the temple will be laying
[1:11:09] down. There won't be one stone upon
[1:11:11] another. another era is going to come.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; He said
[1:11:24] in the
[1:11:25] a scripture which he read, "Blessed is
[1:11:28] he that readeth,
[1:11:30] Revelation 1 and3, and they that hear
[1:11:33] the words of this prophecy and keep the
[1:11:36] sayings which are written therein."
[1:11:38] Four. And the reason for blessed are
[1:11:40] they is because the time is at hand.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham takes that phrase,
[1:11:47] the time is at hand. In Revelation, the
[1:11:51] Revelation series
[1:11:53] uh church age book chapter 1 says the
[1:11:56] time was not at hand previously.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; The time wasn't at hand previously. The
[1:12:02] warning for Los Angeles wasn't needed
[1:12:05] previously. He was sent with that
[1:12:07] warning. He was sent with that
[1:12:09] declaration. The time was not at hand
[1:12:12] previously. In the wisdom and economy of
[1:12:14] God, this mighty revelation could not
[1:12:17] come forth hitherto. This revelation
[1:12:19] couldn't come previously. He says, "Thus
[1:12:22] we immediately learn a principle. The
[1:12:24] revelation of God for each age can come
[1:12:28] can each age can come in that age only
[1:12:32] and at that specific time." What you're
[1:12:35] hearing today couldn't even have come to
[1:12:37] the previous generation. It had to come
[1:12:40] at your time.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; And you young people will hear at it
[1:12:45] perhaps hear it. You hear the same words
[1:12:47] and you'll hear it at a different level
[1:12:49] than perhaps someone else because you
[1:12:51] will be energized and inspired and
[1:12:54] revelated and say, "This is my time.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; I'm here.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; I'm breathing. I've been given life.
[1:13:02] Doesn't matter how you came down
[1:13:04] physically. It matters what you heard
[1:13:06] spiritually.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; God ordained that I would hear this. God
[1:13:10] ordained that I would be in a certain
[1:13:12] camp, hear a certain messenger, sit in a
[1:13:14] certain church, hear a certain thing.
[1:13:16] God ordained this is my time.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Says the revelation of God to Moses came
[1:13:26] only at a specific time in history. And
[1:13:29] even more specifically, it came as the
[1:13:31] people cried unto God.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus himself came at the fullness of
[1:13:36] time. Fullness of time. Please hang on
[1:13:38] to that. He being the complete
[1:13:40] revelation of the Godhead. And in this
[1:13:42] age, Leodysian, the revelation of God
[1:13:46] will come in its due time.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; It will not falter. Neither will it be
[1:13:52] premature.
[1:13:53] Think on this and heed it well. For we
[1:13:56] are in the end time today.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, let us be moved.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Let our hearts be opened.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; And say, "Oh, God, don't let me miss a
[1:14:08] thing.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Let me get every tidbit. Let me get
[1:14:11] every part.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; This is the time. This is my time.
[1:14:15] That's why I'm here."
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; I'd say, "If it's not your time, why
[1:14:19] weren't you born previously? here. Why
[1:14:21] weren't you born sometime in the future?
[1:14:23] You were born now. You were brought here
[1:14:26] now for this season, for this time.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; We're not here just to be a carpenter or
[1:14:32] a a plumber or electrician or or or
[1:14:36] something else or a housewife or even
[1:14:38] though that's our ministry. We have to
[1:14:40] do those things. That's part of this
[1:14:42] life. But your real call, your real call
[1:14:45] was to hear this word. Your real call
[1:14:48] was to hear this messenger. God sent
[1:14:51] you. And so the you you the real prayer
[1:14:53] is, "Oh God, thank you for your voice.
[1:14:56] I've heard it.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; I heeded it.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:04] [Music]
[1:15:04] [Applause]
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; It will not falter.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; And it will not be premature."
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; So then that time came at the time of
[1:15:14] Jesus. Jesus came at the fullness of
[1:15:16] time. And then the fullness came
[1:15:20] the fullness of the of the Old
[1:15:23] Testament. And the Bible says, "And when
[1:15:25] the fullness of time was come, God sent
[1:15:28] forth his son." when the fullness of
[1:15:31] time when God was done with the law and
[1:15:34] because that could never bring man to
[1:15:36] righteousness even the prophets
[1:15:38] everything that they they kept trying to
[1:15:40] turn the people back back to the law to
[1:15:42] the keeping of the things and it could
[1:15:44] not bring a people to perfection it
[1:15:46] couldn't bring them to a wave sheath
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; that isn't what God desired all burning
[1:15:53] of animals and sacrifices and he even
[1:15:55] said one place all your new moons and
[1:15:58] your sacrifices is a stench in my
[1:16:00] nostrils. That is what he wanted.
[1:16:02] Integrity of the heart.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; But there was no transforming power in
[1:16:07] the blood of bulls and goats. But
[1:16:09] there's transforming power in the life
[1:16:11] of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Be ye therefore transformed. And when
[1:16:20] the fullness of time was come, God sent
[1:16:22] forth a son made of a woman and made
[1:16:24] under the law. And that that's why Jesus
[1:16:26] said, "Think not that I've come to
[1:16:28] destroy the law and the prophets.
[1:16:32] I've come think not that I come to
[1:16:34] destroy the law or the prophets. I'm not
[1:16:37] come to destroy, but to fulfill." In
[1:16:40] other words, I've come to bring it to
[1:16:42] its final conclusion. I've come to bring
[1:16:45] it to its fullness. I'm the end of it.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Not that God cast it off and said,
[1:16:50] "Well, that was a big mistake." No. Then
[1:16:52] Jesus came at the end of it and says,
[1:16:54] "I'm part of the fulfillment.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; I've brought it to its conclusion. I've
[1:16:59] brought it. The will of God concerning
[1:17:01] the law and the prophets has now been
[1:17:03] completed. I'm a part of that
[1:17:05] completion. Are you with me?"
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; And that after Jesus short time to
[1:17:11] fulfill it is to bring it to the full
[1:17:13] measure. Jesus was the full measure
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; of the whole Old Testament and the law
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; to render it perfect to bring it to
[1:17:22] pass. So Jesus came to fulfill or bring
[1:17:26] the final conclusion of the Old
[1:17:28] Testament law and prophets. Thus when he
[1:17:33] the lamb of God died
[1:17:35] at the time of the feast of the Passover
[1:17:38] all other lambs died in vain. Jesus
[1:17:42] lived for 33 and a2 years. But during
[1:17:45] those years, they kept the Passover
[1:17:47] every year. And every year, God honored
[1:17:50] their Passover. They all killed their
[1:17:53] lambs. And God honored their lambs. But
[1:17:56] when the fullness came and God's lamb
[1:17:59] was hanging on Calvary that day, they
[1:18:02] killed all their lambs in vain.
[1:18:04] [Applause]
[1:18:08] You see friends,
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; that is why when God's prophet messenger
[1:18:12] came and after he delivered his message,
[1:18:16] it was fine for us to come and we gather
[1:18:19] in churches and we sing songs of
[1:18:21] worship. But when finally the message
[1:18:24] came, which was Christ himself and the
[1:18:27] people turned that down, all of their
[1:18:29] singing, all of their worship, all that
[1:18:31] became empty. Amen.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Because an era had passed.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; So they sang in vain. They practiced in
[1:18:44] vain. They prayed in vain. They
[1:18:46] worshiped in vain because it was man's
[1:18:48] doing and not God's doing.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; God was here. God stood on the platform.
[1:18:54] The pillar of fire was on the platform.
[1:18:57] God witnessed it. And they rejected it
[1:19:00] and turned it down. and religion became
[1:19:02] an empty and that is why Hollywood has
[1:19:05] moved to the platform.
[1:19:07] [Applause]
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; I'm glad we still have the Holy Ghost on
[1:19:11] the platform. I'm glad we still have the
[1:19:14] pillar of fire at the platform.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Unfolding the word speaking
[1:19:20] to the people
[1:19:22] [Applause]
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:30] Hallelujah.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; God come amongst us.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Do whatever is necessary here.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; So the fullness of time had come.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; And Jesus came to bring this
[1:19:43] fulfillment.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; And he says the law and the prophets
[1:19:47] were until John
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; were until John.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; And since that time
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; the kingdom of God is preached. It's a
[1:19:57] different era,
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; a different time. So the law and the
[1:20:01] prophets where until John, until that
[1:20:04] time, but now the kingdom of God is
[1:20:07] preached, something else is happening.
[1:20:10] And that's why Jesus could say, "I
[1:20:11] didn't come to destroy it. I'm putting
[1:20:13] all of these together. I came to fulfill
[1:20:15] it."
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; And so he began to turn. He began to
[1:20:20] announce. Even John the Baptist began to
[1:20:24] announce that another era is coming. The
[1:20:26] lamb of God is here. I'm going to
[1:20:29] introduce him. I don't know who he is,
[1:20:30] but I'm going to introduce him. What a
[1:20:33] revelation when he saw his own cousin
[1:20:35] after the flesh walking in the mud of uh
[1:20:38] of Jordan River and saying, "This is him
[1:20:41] of whom I spake."
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; He knew no man after the flesh.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; He only knew him after the spirit and
[1:20:49] the word of God. This is him. Behold the
[1:20:53] lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[1:20:56] the world.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus began to turn the corner
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; from law to grace.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; And that is why then the apostle Paul
[1:21:07] came and it was it was important. It was
[1:21:10] absolutely essential that he would meet
[1:21:12] the pillar of fire not in the flesh. He
[1:21:15] didn't know Jesus after the flesh. He
[1:21:18] met him on the road to to Damascus and
[1:21:21] he and the apostle and brother Brandham
[1:21:22] says he knew that presence. He knew that
[1:21:25] was the same one that was in the burning
[1:21:27] bush back there. He said and that's why
[1:21:30] he could turn the corner from lot of
[1:21:32] grace. He had to have that kind of an
[1:21:34] encounter.
[1:21:37] Listen my brother, my sister, the Holy
[1:21:40] Spirit, the prophet of God, the prophet
[1:21:43] of God
[1:21:45] had the pillar of fire in attendance and
[1:21:48] saw it over the people and revealed the
[1:21:51] secret of the people's hearts. Are you
[1:21:53] ready?
[1:21:54] While that pillar of fire hung over him
[1:21:58] and while that pillar of fire hung over
[1:22:00] the room where he where the seals were
[1:22:02] opened, you are the product
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; of what he spoke
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; under the pillar of fire.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, that that does so much for me. We're
[1:22:19] here. We're here as a product.
[1:22:25] You're a product of the pillar of fire.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; You're not the product of this church.
[1:22:31] You're not the product of some man's
[1:22:32] ministry. You're the product of the
[1:22:34] pillar of fire.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:44] That's it for the Lord.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; In the message, evening messenger, he
[1:22:47] said, "It's always been a fight
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; for the messenger
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; to separate the old from the new."
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; It's always been a fight for the
[1:22:55] messenger coming to separate the old
[1:22:59] from new.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Though always the message
[1:23:02] must be scriptural, now for each
[1:23:05] foretold of the other." For instance, he
[1:23:07] said Jesus how hard it was him to come
[1:23:10] in and change the message from law to
[1:23:12] grace. Yet the Bible said it would come
[1:23:15] that way and there'd come a Messiah and
[1:23:18] the daily sacrifice would be done
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; would be over. So that was Jesus part
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; of turning it from law to grace
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; and then apostle Paul
[1:23:33] he came
[1:23:35] the sacrifice of Jesus Christ
[1:23:38] was the full end and the completion of
[1:23:40] the prophecy this prophecy and the
[1:23:44] woman's seed shall bruise the serpent's
[1:23:48] headl
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; that had to
[1:23:51] And he was the fullness of that
[1:23:52] prophecy. No one had to come and doctor
[1:23:55] it up. No one had to come and add to it.
[1:23:57] The serpent's head was crushed at
[1:23:59] Calvary.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; We must never forget that.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; And that is why in the Patmas vision,
[1:24:05] Jesus could say, "I am the first and the
[1:24:08] last. I am he that liveth and was dead,
[1:24:10] and behold, I'm alive forever more."
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; What is there to fear? The judgment that
[1:24:16] fell upon him at the cross, at the
[1:24:18] grave, and when he descended was for us.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; He absorbed. He absorbed. Are you
[1:24:24] listening? He absorbed the full brunt of
[1:24:28] the wound of sin. And there therefore is
[1:24:31] now no condemnation to them which are in
[1:24:33] Christ Jesus.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Here is the one who conquered both
[1:24:37] worlds, the seen and the unseen.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Here he is.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Not back there. He's here. He conquered
[1:24:45] both worlds. He conquered the world that
[1:24:48] you tend you have to live in and tend
[1:24:50] with and he conquered the world that is
[1:24:52] to come.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Because Satan wants to keep us out of
[1:24:58] there. He's not going to be able to do
[1:25:00] it.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; The atmosphere in the in the future
[1:25:03] home, the atmosphere is filled with
[1:25:05] demon spirits. They come to afflict you.
[1:25:08] That's the unseen world. This Jesus that
[1:25:11] has spoken to you, that called you, has
[1:25:14] defeated that that atmosphere.
[1:25:20] [Applause]
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; He alone is the savior, redeemer. He is
[1:25:26] the only God. The Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:25:28] his name.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul was chosen by God. never
[1:25:35] got to walk with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:25:37] But he was the one chosen to separate
[1:25:39] the law from grace. And the prophet said
[1:25:42] in Christ the mystery, God revealed Paul
[1:25:44] had something greater than any of the
[1:25:46] apostles did because Paul saw him
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; after he was dead,
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; buried, and rose again and expressed
[1:25:54] himself in the pillar of fire that led
[1:25:56] the children of Israel. That led the
[1:25:59] children of Israel. No wonder that he
[1:26:01] could separate the law from grace. Over
[1:26:04] in the book of Hebrews, he meant the
[1:26:06] same pillar of fire.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; And then there's another fullness,
[1:26:15] the fullness of the Gentiles.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; And here you are.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Here we are.
[1:26:27] Amen.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; The fullness of times
[1:26:36] when that will take place and the Bible
[1:26:39] says
[1:26:41] the fullness of the Gentiles when the
[1:26:44] fullness of the Gentiles arrived and the
[1:26:47] fullness of times it's referred to both
[1:26:49] ways. God sent his last messenger not
[1:26:52] John the Baptist but the same spirit of
[1:26:55] Elijah. When the fullness of times of
[1:26:58] the Old Testament came, God sent Elijah
[1:27:01] the third time of his coming. When the
[1:27:03] fullness of time of the Gentiles came,
[1:27:05] God sent Elijah because that was his
[1:27:08] most faithful prophet spirit. He sends
[1:27:11] Elijah to turn the people back. It was
[1:27:13] Elijah who rebuilt the altar. It was
[1:27:16] Elijah who called fire down from heaven.
[1:27:19] It was Elijah and then Elisha came with
[1:27:21] a double portion of Elisha. And they and
[1:27:24] then and then came John the Baptist in
[1:27:26] the spirit of Elias but didn't do any
[1:27:28] miracles. He only had a message.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God that takes away
[1:27:33] the sin of the world to turn the
[1:27:35] people's hearts back to him.
[1:27:38] [Music]
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Then when brother Brandham came, he had
[1:27:41] both miracles and a message
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; because it's the fullness of the
[1:27:47] Gentiles
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; and the gospel will go back to the Jews.
[1:27:52] There's an awakening happening there in
[1:27:55] Israel. And there's awakening happening
[1:27:57] here.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; There's awakening happening amongst the
[1:28:00] bride.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; And so this fullness,
[1:28:11] there's a fullness of the Gentiles.
[1:28:16] Paul said, "For I, brethren, for I would
[1:28:20] not, brethren, that you should be
[1:28:21] ignorant of this mystery, lest you
[1:28:23] should be wise, this mystery,
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; that you should be wise in your own
[1:28:28] conceits, that blindness in part has
[1:28:31] happened to Israel until
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus said the law and the prophets was
[1:28:37] until John."
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; And now the Apostle Paul is coming and
[1:28:40] he's prophesying and he's saying that
[1:28:42] blindness in part has happened to Israel
[1:28:44] until the fullness of the Gentiles
[1:28:47] become him.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; In Ephesians, he said that in the
[1:28:52] dispensation of the fullness of times,
[1:28:54] he might gather together in one all
[1:28:58] things in Christ. He couldn't gather all
[1:29:01] things into Christ if Christ remained
[1:29:04] partially a mystery.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; He couldn't gather them into Christ
[1:29:08] because Christ is the word. If the seals
[1:29:10] were never open, he had to have a
[1:29:14] vindicated messenger with orders to come
[1:29:18] and open the seals or to speak the
[1:29:21] opening. Brother Brandham didn't open
[1:29:23] the seals. The lamb opened the seals.
[1:29:25] The prophet of God was the mouthpiece to
[1:29:27] speak what was open.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; The opening of those seas seals was
[1:29:34] signaling the end
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; of an era. and the opening of another
[1:29:40] era
[1:29:42] [Applause]
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:29:46] of times. The fullness of times is
[1:29:48] connected to the gathering
[1:29:52] in one being Christ all things both
[1:29:56] which are in heaven and that which is in
[1:29:59] earth
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; even into him.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; How could they be gathered into him if
[1:30:04] he remained a mystery?
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; The mystery had to be made known. The
[1:30:08] mystery of the serpent seed had to be
[1:30:10] made known. The mystery of the godhead
[1:30:13] had to be known. We can't worship a a a
[1:30:16] trinity of gods or a multiplicity of
[1:30:19] gods. We worship God himself
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; revealed as a father, as a son, and in
[1:30:25] the holy spirit.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Are you following me? Amen.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; In the seventh seal, I'm talking about
[1:30:36] the fullness. In the seventh seal, he
[1:30:39] said, "We must remember that the seventh
[1:30:41] seal is the end time of all things."
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; It is the end.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; It is the end of the struggling world.
[1:30:53] It is the end of the struggling nature.
[1:30:56] It's the end of everything. It's the end
[1:30:58] of the trumpets. It's the end of the
[1:31:00] vials. It's the end of the earth. It's
[1:31:03] even the end of time. Time runs out.
[1:31:06] Everything runs out in this time. The
[1:31:09] end of the seventh seal. And here we are
[1:31:12] right in the midst of it. We're in the
[1:31:14] winding up. We're in the fullness. We've
[1:31:16] heard the concluding messenger. He's
[1:31:18] already gave his message. There won't be
[1:31:20] another one.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; If you're waiting for better meetings,
[1:31:27] they may never come.
[1:31:29] Jump in right now.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Jump in and say, "Here I am, Lord." Pour
[1:31:37] it in. Pour it in. Pour it in.
[1:31:40] Pour revelation into me. Pour zeal into
[1:31:44] me.
[1:31:46] Don't let this world make us to become
[1:31:49] kind of lopsided and and lukewarm.
[1:31:53] We deny the world. We deny that lukewarm
[1:31:56] spirit. We deny the soft light.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:05] [Applause]
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's just all
[1:32:11] excitement." I say, "Give me more.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Give me more of this kind of excitement.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Let me be carried right out of my
[1:32:20] house."
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Into the realms of the spirit. be lifted
[1:32:26] up into the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; This is a reality.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; And when you finally realize, friend, I
[1:32:33] want everybody in this building, this
[1:32:35] isn't going to come your way again.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; This is coming your way now.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; There's not going to be another message.
[1:32:42] There's not going to be the seals open
[1:32:43] again. They have been open.
[1:32:48] [Applause]
[1:32:56] the perfect will of God.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Now you'll have a different revelation
[1:33:00] every time you say the Lord's Prayer.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Our Father, which art in heaven,
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Hallowed be thy name.
[1:33:11] Thy kingdom come.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Thy will be done.
[1:33:17] And brother Brandham says on the seventh
[1:33:18] seal, I have it here somewhere
[1:33:21] my notes. He says we shouldn't think
[1:33:23] it's been that this is strange. And he
[1:33:25] mentions the Colin boy Collins boy and
[1:33:28] the girl healed from luccomia leukemia
[1:33:30] rather. He said what it is. It's the
[1:33:34] kingdom of God coming.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Healing is just a small part of it. This
[1:33:39] is the healing. This is the kingdom of
[1:33:41] God coming. the opening of this seventh
[1:33:44] seal and the and all the other seals.
[1:33:46] This is the kingdom of God coming.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Hey, we pray thy will be done and
[1:33:51] everybody prays it and God does it and
[1:33:53] they miss it.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; It's a kingdom of God coming.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; He said more and more from the negative
[1:34:00] to the positive
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; as it has been.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; It's been happening.
[1:34:12] Oh my goodness.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; The perfect will of God,
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; which is the completion, the completed
[1:34:21] the the the what was set out, the
[1:34:26] definite goal and the point that God had
[1:34:29] in his mind. He said, "Who gave himself
[1:34:32] for our sins, Galatians 1:4, that he
[1:34:35] might deliver us from the present evil
[1:34:37] world according to the will of God." All
[1:34:41] of this happened to deliver you and I
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; from this present
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; evil world.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; And you young people especially, you
[1:34:53] will perhaps if time goes on, you will
[1:34:56] contend with things that I don't have to
[1:34:58] contend with. But this message came to
[1:35:01] deliver you from this present evil
[1:35:04] world. And this world is not getting
[1:35:07] better and it's not improving. It's
[1:35:10] becoming more wicked, more vile, more uh
[1:35:14] flagrant with its evil. It'll pour it
[1:35:17] out on you. It'll in an insidious way.
[1:35:20] It'll put it in the on the shopping
[1:35:21] centers. It'll put it on the clothes
[1:35:23] racks. It'll put it before our children
[1:35:26] in school. That's why I'm so thankful
[1:35:28] for the school that is here and the Holy
[1:35:30] Ghost teachers that they can give our
[1:35:33] children an atmosphere
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; to nurture
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; the spiritual life.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; It's not going to come less
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; in the school system. It's going to come
[1:35:46] more.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "You can't
[1:35:50] outsmart him.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Don't think you're going to outsmart
[1:35:54] him. He is so slick.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; He knows the Bible better than any of
[1:35:58] us.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; But he has no revelation.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; And this is the revelation we have. This
[1:36:06] is the word. He can't even get a hold of
[1:36:08] it.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Deliver us.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. deliver us from this present
[1:36:22] evil world.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; To deliver, the word even is to choose
[1:36:26] out for oneself.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; In delivering you, it isn't it just that
[1:36:31] he frees you and cuts some bondages off.
[1:36:34] He chooses you for himself.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; He's the untouchable one.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Christ is untouchable. He's already been
[1:36:43] He's already uh satisfied the judgment
[1:36:46] of God with the full curse at Calvary.
[1:36:49] He's the untouchable one.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; He's the mighty conqueror.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; And you can say today, I am in the
[1:36:56] mighty conqueror.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; I am untouchable in him.
[1:37:02] [Applause]
[1:37:05] When the fullness of the Gentiles
[1:37:07] arrived in the fullness of times, God
[1:37:09] sent forth this last messenger. In the
[1:37:12] fullness of the Gentiles, in the
[1:37:14] fullness of times, a messenger to the
[1:37:17] age always comes at the end of the age.
[1:37:19] And so, this is the end of the age. I'm
[1:37:21] going to hurry along now. In the what is
[1:37:23] the attraction? And he says, "And God of
[1:37:25] heaven promised the evening time would
[1:37:27] have an evening light. And three years
[1:37:29] ago, this mystery was a prophecy."
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "What time is it, sir? But now
[1:37:34] it's history. It's passed. The promise
[1:37:37] is fulfilled." He said, "Just three
[1:37:40] years ago, this was a mystery. Today,
[1:37:42] it's history.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be looking at things
[1:37:47] and think that they're a mystery when in
[1:37:49] fact, they may already be history.
[1:37:54] We're not sitting here
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; to just, like I say, be rocked to sleep.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; We're here to be shaken
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; and moved.
[1:38:03] [Music]
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be looking at things
[1:38:06] and think it's a mystery waiting to be
[1:38:08] revealed when in fact it's already
[1:38:10] history. And he said this in modern
[1:38:12] events. He said, "What a time it is that
[1:38:14] we're living in." He said, "We're living
[1:38:17] in the bride age." The calling uh
[1:38:21] bringing back to God through a channel
[1:38:23] that he promised to bring it back in.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Look at that was a modern events made
[1:38:29] clear. This was just a few hours before
[1:38:31] he was leaving.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; This is this is one of his last
[1:38:35] messages.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Rapture, modern events made clear.
[1:38:40] Things that things that are to be in
[1:38:42] modern events made clear. That was and
[1:38:44] then the last message was leadership.
[1:38:46] There's a second last message. He's
[1:38:48] saying it's already happened.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Can I read that again for you?
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; What time is it?
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; He's asking the people that are there,
[1:39:01] what time is it? And I take those words
[1:39:03] and repeat them this morning. Not
[1:39:05] because we're back there, because we're
[1:39:06] up here. But we can say the same word.
[1:39:08] What time is it, folks?
[1:39:15] What time is it?
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "We're living in the bride
[1:39:18] age." I say, "We're living in the time
[1:39:20] of the bride's been called."
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; But we are living in the bride age.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. The bride's been
[1:39:27] called.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Dear ones, young ones, the bride's been
[1:39:34] called.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; You are the youth of that calling.
[1:39:37] [Applause]
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Don't take this one lightly.
[1:39:42] This thing's been on my heart and in my
[1:39:44] bosom for weeks.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Oh God, give me the strength and give me
[1:39:49] the words. I pray that the Holy Spirit
[1:39:51] would take the words and plant it
[1:39:53] directly into your heart.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; We're not living I'm not here to speak
[1:40:01] to you about history, speak to you about
[1:40:03] something that's been fulfilled.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; We're living in the bride age and the
[1:40:07] calling back to God through a channel.
[1:40:10] and the channel was standing right in
[1:40:11] front of them and they didn't miss they
[1:40:13] missed it completely went straight over
[1:40:15] their head
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; in leadership the very last message he
[1:40:20] goes on he says as Moses called a nation
[1:40:22] out of a nation Christ today
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; is calling a church out of a church and
[1:40:28] Christ right at that day was calling a
[1:40:31] church out of a church and they missed
[1:40:32] it
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; and here we are the church of the living
[1:40:36] God
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; called by the living word of God. My
[1:40:40] friends, this isn't just some other uh
[1:40:42] other doctrine to get excited about.
[1:40:45] This isn't some mental gymnastics. This
[1:40:48] is the truth that's burning in our soul.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; What was the attraction on the mount? He
[1:40:53] says, "What was the attraction was
[1:40:55] because scripture was being fulfilled?"
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; That's why there's such a burning.
[1:41:01] That's why there's such an excitement.
[1:41:03] Scripture is being fulfilled. Not has
[1:41:06] been, is being fulfilled.
[1:41:11] [Applause]
[1:41:11] [Music]
[1:41:15] Amen.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; The same thing in type. He said, "Taking
[1:41:19] them to the glorious eternal promised
[1:41:22] land." Not just the promised land of
[1:41:25] Israel, but to the eternal promised
[1:41:27] land. Amen. Amen.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; In the in the end time message, he said,
[1:41:34] "And oh, I'm so glad to be on the earth
[1:41:36] now just before the break of day."
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; That was 1954. Listen, I'm I'm taking
[1:41:43] you. I hope you're following me now in
[1:41:45] the sequence. I'm showing you as it was
[1:41:47] there in his earlier ministry. Here it
[1:41:48] is here in his later ministry. And here
[1:41:49] we are here.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Then I'm going to come to future home.
[1:41:53] I've got to really move.
[1:41:56] says, "I'm so glad to be on the earth
[1:41:58] now." Just before the break of day,
[1:42:00] herald the message of his blessed
[1:42:02] appearing. He He knew back then in 54.
[1:42:06] He knew he was heralding. He knew he was
[1:42:09] the heralder. He knew he was the
[1:42:11] messenger. He knew he had been sent with
[1:42:13] an announcement to tell the people,
[1:42:16] "This is the appearing of the Lord Jesus
[1:42:18] Christ."
[1:42:20] And behold, the fig leaves now are
[1:42:22] becoming green,
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; and the gospel of the kingdom is
[1:42:26] sweeping to every nation. And we're near
[1:42:28] the end can be seen. And then we come to
[1:42:30] 64 in shalom.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; From 54 to 64. Now we come 10 years. He
[1:42:36] said, God who made the promise in the
[1:42:38] last days these things would happen that
[1:42:41] we see happen. He says, "If he the
[1:42:44] promised son and the promised son came,
[1:42:46] if he promised all these things that we
[1:42:49] see through the scriptures, and it did,
[1:42:52] let's get into the rhythm of it."
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; So, he wasn't saying, "Oh, it's coming."
[1:42:57] He was saying, "It's here.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Get into the rhythm of it now."
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; And I say the beat has gone on and I
[1:43:10] want to be in the beat. I want to be in
[1:43:11] the rhythm, not even of 64, but this
[1:43:15] time 2010.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; God didn't stop back there.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; God didn't finish it back there.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; It's happening today while you're
[1:43:25] sitting here.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:43:34] [Applause]
[1:43:36] [Music]
[1:43:38] Yes, Lord.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:44] [Music]
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Get into the rhythm of it.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "The dawning of a new day." He
[1:43:53] didn't say, "I can see it coming." He
[1:43:55] says, "It's the dawning of a new day."
[1:43:57] This is happening. It's in the He said,
[1:43:59] "I feel it all over me. The light of a
[1:44:02] new day." the light of a day where there
[1:44:04] is no night. Once God starts it, it's
[1:44:08] already started. We can't stop it. It's
[1:44:11] not going to have any interruptions.
[1:44:13] It's going to come right to the eternal
[1:44:15] day
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; where there's no night and there's no
[1:44:20] darkness and no shadows, no skies to
[1:44:24] dim, no dark skies, no midnights, no
[1:44:28] graves, no flowers on the hillsides, no
[1:44:32] funeral section.
[1:44:35] Say, "Oh God,
[1:44:38] give me that time."
[1:44:40] And we've been called. You've been
[1:44:42] called into it.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; That's what God did for you at camp.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you what happened at
[1:44:48] camp. It's just another step in this
[1:44:51] great movement.
[1:44:53] It's just another step on the way to the
[1:44:56] hillsides where there'll be no more
[1:44:58] flowers, there'll be no more graves,
[1:45:01] there'll be no more funeral possessions,
[1:45:03] there'll be no storms, there'll be no
[1:45:06] disasters.
[1:45:07] That's what you've been called to.
[1:45:12] Hallelujah.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; don't spurn this invitation.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Don't spurn this invitation,
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; my dear little ones,
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; because he's not going to give it again.
[1:45:37] When the king sent out his servant and
[1:45:39] said, "Go and invite them." And they
[1:45:42] were busy and had their things to do. He
[1:45:45] never said, "Go back and try and
[1:45:46] persuade them.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Just leave them to their things.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; I'm busy with my auction and I'm busy. I
[1:45:52] bought a piece of ground. I'm busy with
[1:45:54] this and I'm busy with that." Leave them
[1:45:56] to it.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Now go out again and get the halt and
[1:46:00] the maimed and the blind. And so and he
[1:46:03] goes out again. He says in the second
[1:46:04] pole, "And there's still more room."
[1:46:06] says, "Go into the highways and the
[1:46:08] byways."
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Get the drunkards and the alcoholics and
[1:46:13] the prostitutes and get those that are
[1:46:16] blasphemers and get them all. Get the
[1:46:18] dopers and the drug addicts. Get them
[1:46:20] all. Get the religious one. Get them
[1:46:23] all.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Persuade them to come in.
[1:46:31] [Music]
[1:46:34] He said now
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; the darkness is separating
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; itself from the light.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; That's what he now was seeing. It
[1:46:44] changed from 54 to 64 and it changed
[1:46:47] even further
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; from 64 till now. Many of these people
[1:46:52] rejected it. But now we hear the same
[1:46:55] message and the same messenger and we
[1:46:57] say it's for me.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; He said God caused it
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; and the light's doing it.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; You've heard me maybe preach on it if
[1:47:09] you remember. He said the light's
[1:47:11] pressing itself.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; The light is pressing itself in such a
[1:47:15] way until the darkness has to congregate
[1:47:19] together. You say, "Why is this terrible
[1:47:21] wickedness happening?" It's the light
[1:47:23] that's pressing it.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; The light is squeezing the darkness.
[1:47:30] Light is greater than darkness. And the
[1:47:33] light is squeezing the darkness, calling
[1:47:35] it to coagulate, if you would, causing
[1:47:38] it to condense.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; It becomes the evil becomes gross evil.
[1:47:44] The darkness, gross darkness, the filth
[1:47:47] and uncleanness, vile. It's because a
[1:47:50] light is pressing it. and separating
[1:47:53] from it and they're just given over to
[1:47:55] straight darkness
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Ghost
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit fil people
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; are going to leave this world
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; and I say to you in the name of the Lord
[1:48:07] you don't want to be here
[1:48:10] [Music]
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; I just want to say to you
[1:48:18] I feel like I'm announcing some things
[1:48:20] today I really do.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; I felt I was going to come to the pulpit
[1:48:24] with announcement to let you know that
[1:48:26] we're a lot further down the road
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; than perhaps you have realized.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; We can't take it just kind of hung ho,
[1:48:34] you know, easy. No, no more.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; He said, I'm sure that you've noticed
[1:48:47] the seventh seal. I'm sure that you've
[1:48:48] noticed the thing that's been happening
[1:48:50] this week. The kingdom of God is coming.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; That's quite an announcement.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is coming
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; and it's becoming more and more from the
[1:48:59] negative to the positive as it has been.
[1:49:02] We're just drawing closer to God all the
[1:49:04] time.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Our heavenly father, thy will be done on
[1:49:07] earth as it is in heaven.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Let your pleasure be done. And he's
[1:49:12] saying it's being done. I'm calling them
[1:49:15] and they're responding. They're coming
[1:49:17] into this new day. They're coming into
[1:49:19] this glorious light.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Can I have a little more time?
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Then we we're not going to squeeze in on
[1:49:32] Tom's time tonight, but I want to get I
[1:49:35] want to get this now. I have I have some
[1:49:37] slides and I want to get to it. Speaking
[1:49:40] of our future home, I gave you a little
[1:49:42] background right at the very beginning.
[1:49:45] He speaks of the three stages of the
[1:49:46] earth. He goes into the eighth day and
[1:49:49] all speaking of eternity.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; I might as well drop my bomb right now.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; This message and this messenger actually
[1:50:04] was ordained to usher you into eternity.
[1:50:17] That's the purpose
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; of such a phenomenal ministry
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; to usher you into eternity.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham,
[1:50:29] he only used the phrase
[1:50:31] the phrase. Now listen to me carefully.
[1:50:37] Feast of the tabernacles. Feast of
[1:50:40] Tabernacles. He referred to feasts and
[1:50:43] tabernacles and so on and other places,
[1:50:45] but he only used the phrase
[1:50:49] feast of tabernacles four times. And
[1:50:53] they're all in the future home.
[1:50:58] Because the future home, the very
[1:51:01] message is the very word of God coming
[1:51:03] to the believing bride to let her know
[1:51:06] this word is going to take you to a
[1:51:09] change.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; This word is ordained. It's already been
[1:51:14] seasoned with the eternal word of God.
[1:51:17] From the thought of God, this this
[1:51:19] messenger is going to call my family.
[1:51:21] I'm going to lead them. This is the
[1:51:23] calling out of the bride. I'll give them
[1:51:25] the sign of the resurrection. They'll
[1:51:26] believe it. I'll give them the sign of
[1:51:28] the Messiah and they'll believe it. I'll
[1:51:30] send all these announcements and they'll
[1:51:32] believe it. And then I'll I'll notify
[1:51:34] them about the future home and I'll talk
[1:51:36] to them about the the the feast of the
[1:51:38] tabernacles.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; And at the feast of tabernacles, I'll
[1:51:41] have my messenger take them to the last
[1:51:44] day of the feast of the tabernacles to
[1:51:46] show them that it's that day is not even
[1:51:49] in the in the calendar. It's not the
[1:51:50] Sabbath. It's not the great day of the
[1:51:53] feast of the Sabbath, but it's a day
[1:51:56] after on the morning after because it
[1:51:58] was on the eighth day that Jesus our
[1:52:01] Sabbath raised.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; It was on the eighth day that the Holy
[1:52:06] Ghost came to give birth to the church
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; because he took him into eternity.
[1:52:15] And the messenger had to bring it to you
[1:52:17] and I to realize this is a message of
[1:52:20] the eighth day.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; He said the seventh day speaks of time.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; But the eighth day speaks of eternity.
[1:52:28] [Music]
[1:52:28] [Applause]
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Three stages of the earth and the world
[1:52:34] out of out of Peter's gospel. Let me get
[1:52:38] myself organized here
[1:52:42] where we read the world that then was
[1:52:46] the heavens and the earth which are now
[1:52:51] and the new heavens and the new earth
[1:52:54] wherein dwelleth righteousness
[1:52:58] in the future home and the three stages
[1:53:01] of the world once again the old world
[1:53:04] that stood out of the water which was
[1:53:05] the that was the Andalivian world the
[1:53:08] present world we live in now and the
[1:53:11] world that is to come the new world It
[1:53:14] means from passing from one thing. When
[1:53:18] it says pass away, it's the passing from
[1:53:22] one thing to another. To pass from one
[1:53:25] condition, it says to another.
[1:53:29] What does it mean? The earth will be
[1:53:32] loosed from the grip of Satan. It'll be
[1:53:35] loosed. It'll be loosed from politics.
[1:53:38] It'll be loosed from denominational
[1:53:40] religion systems. It'll be used for the
[1:53:42] kingdom of God to be established here on
[1:53:44] the earth. Do you realize that, friends?
[1:53:46] Whether you're in Washington, British
[1:53:48] Columbia, or California, or wherever it
[1:53:49] is, regardless of how vile or how
[1:53:51] wicked, you realize that France and
[1:53:53] Paris and the UK and London and all of
[1:53:55] these places and whether off into Russia
[1:53:58] or down into down into Africa, this
[1:54:01] world, God created it for himself.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; And righteousness is going to be in
[1:54:06] Kinshasa. Righteousness is going to be
[1:54:09] in Johannesburg. Righteousness is going
[1:54:11] to be in San Francisco. Righteousness is
[1:54:14] going to be in Los Angeles. That place
[1:54:16] was given to God. He created it.
[1:54:22] It will be righteous. And listen
[1:54:24] friends, the messenger has come to make
[1:54:26] the announcement.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; And that's why he says this law is going
[1:54:30] to slide into the ocean
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; and this wickedness is going to be done
[1:54:34] away with.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:54:39] I feel like doing a dance.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; We established here on earth. He says,
[1:54:52] "One time it one time I was his
[1:54:55] property." Why don't you say that
[1:54:57] together? One time I was his property,
[1:55:00] but not now.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; But not now.
[1:55:06] He came to lose the grip of it. He
[1:55:08] loosed the grip of sin, of Satan upon my
[1:55:11] life, upon your life. And now we're not
[1:55:14] his.
[1:55:18] Why do we say that? Now we're not his.
[1:55:22] Let the devil know we're not his.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends. Elijah said that.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost said that
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; by the spirit of Elijah.
[1:55:38] We're not his.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; The grip has been loose. You think he's
[1:55:44] got some strings tied to you? You
[1:55:46] announce to him this morning, I've been
[1:55:48] loosed from you.
[1:55:51] He loosed me from your grip.
[1:55:55] I don't care what your circumstances are
[1:55:57] in life. Our God is greater than those
[1:56:00] circumstances.
[1:56:04] Amen.
[1:56:08] [Applause]
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Have you often heard me say in prayer,
[1:56:14] Brother Bram says, "Take your hands off
[1:56:16] God's property." Amen.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Have faith to claim your own.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; That's your right.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Take your hands off her.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Take your hands off him.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Faith will do it. Maybe you need to say
[1:56:30] that. Take your hands off her. Take your
[1:56:33] hands off him. She's God's property.
[1:56:36] He's God's property.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Loose him.
[1:56:41] [Music]
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; He said it's the same word as when he
[1:56:45] stood at the grave of Lazarus and he
[1:56:47] called Lazarus forth. That was the
[1:56:49] supernatural. But he said to those that
[1:56:51] were around him, "Loose him."
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; In other words, you put the rags on him,
[1:56:55] take them off.
[1:56:58] We're part of a world that has
[1:57:00] encumbered and enslaved people. Take it
[1:57:02] off.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; We're empowered by prayer.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; We're empowered by faith.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Take it off.
[1:57:14] [Music]
[1:57:14] [Applause]
[1:57:16] [Music]
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:21] [Music]
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; I was so blessed. Brother Roy said to
[1:57:27] Judy, "I saw one of your sons. I got him
[1:57:29] mixed up praying at the camp."
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; He began to pray. I thought, "My
[1:57:35] goodness,
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; this is glorious.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Where's this young man been?
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; I know many times you prayed, Brother
[1:57:42] Roy, Sister Judy, take your hands off.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; They're God's property.
[1:57:57] [Music]
[1:58:02] not annihilate it.
[1:58:04] Just take your hands off of it.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; Loose it and let it go.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; When a man's changed, he isn't
[1:58:13] annihilated, but he's he's a changed
[1:58:16] person. He's been changed from what he
[1:58:18] was to what he is. Not annihilated.
[1:58:21] Amen.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Not by works of righteousness which we
[1:58:25] have done, said the Apostle Paul and
[1:58:27] Titus, but according to his mercy, he
[1:58:30] saved us by the washing of the
[1:58:32] regeneration. By washing of re
[1:58:35] regeneration and renewing of the Holy
[1:58:37] Spirit and the and the re the new birth
[1:58:41] uh let's have it here. He said the new
[1:58:44] birth hence renovation. I just want to
[1:58:47] get what what renovation is. the
[1:58:49] production of a new life consecrated to
[1:58:52] God. A radical change of mind for the
[1:58:54] better. Restored to its pristine state.
[1:58:58] And I have to underline that. Restored
[1:59:01] to its pristine state. We have the Holy
[1:59:04] Spirit has come to us through this
[1:59:06] message to restore you to your pristine
[1:59:08] state.
[1:59:10] [Music]
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:20] There'll be no artificial joints.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; I remember old brother, brother Herb
[1:59:28] Rutherford.
[1:59:30] He was laying in bed and I think he'd
[1:59:33] had some hip joints replaced
[1:59:36] and he had a rougher voice than I have.
[1:59:39] He said, "Brother Ed,"
[1:59:42] he said, "What do you think?" He said,
[1:59:44] "When this change comes in this new
[1:59:47] body," he says, "I'm not going to have
[1:59:49] artificial hips there, am I?" I said,
[1:59:51] "No, boy." I said, "There's going to be
[1:59:53] a lot of stuff laying around,
[1:59:56] artificial knees and artificial joints
[1:59:59] and false teeth and glasses and all
[2:00:02] these things." Praise God.
[2:00:06] It's
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; all going to be gone. It doesn't belong
[2:00:08] in the new world.
[2:00:10] [Applause]
[2:00:15] to our pristine state
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; is the millennium.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; The millennium reign, the thousand years
[2:00:24] is not sorry is not the new earth.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; The thousand years is not the new earth.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; So he said the three stages,
[2:00:35] the millennium is not the new earth.
[2:00:37] It's not even the earth that's here now.
[2:00:39] No, I'll let him I'll let the prophet
[2:00:41] explain it. The millennium reign is a
[2:00:43] different reign and that's what we go
[2:00:45] into the millennium, but that isn't the
[2:00:48] new earth and the new earth. No, he said
[2:00:50] that's just a rest place, a rest period.
[2:00:53] Not at all the new heavens and the new
[2:00:55] earth. For in the millennium, we have
[2:00:57] things that we would not go into that.
[2:00:59] He said it's a type of the old seventh
[2:01:01] day of Eden. Remember the old seventh
[2:01:03] day of Eden when God rested, sin was
[2:01:06] there. There was failure within Adam and
[2:01:09] Eve at that time. And I'm not trying to
[2:01:12] put an interpretation to it, but I just
[2:01:14] say he said it's a type of the old
[2:01:16] seventh day of Eden. The seventh day
[2:01:18] after he made the world, the seventh day
[2:01:20] he rested in Eden.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; The millennium is a type of the seventh
[2:01:26] day. We're still in time in the
[2:01:28] millennium. It's a day, a thousand
[2:01:30] years. It's a time element. Don't get
[2:01:32] that mixed up with the new earth now
[2:01:35] because it's not. Now you say,
[2:01:38] I'm sorry.
[2:01:43] Now you say, brother Brandham, you're
[2:01:45] trying to put something way over yonder
[2:01:47] beyond the seventh day. Sabbath, as God
[2:01:50] made the earth and labored six days and
[2:01:52] rested, the seventh was only a type of
[2:01:54] time. But I just said here, we become
[2:01:57] eternal. Can you say amen? We become
[2:02:00] eternal. And then he said, "Let's take
[2:02:02] the last feast, which was the feast of
[2:02:05] tabernacles." And here's the scripture.
[2:02:07] Seven days you shall offer an offering
[2:02:09] made by fire unto the Lord. On the
[2:02:12] eighth day shall be an holy convocation
[2:02:15] unto you. And you shall offer an
[2:02:17] offering made by fire unto the Lord. It
[2:02:19] is a solemn assembly, and it shall and
[2:02:22] you shall do no survile work therein.
[2:02:24] You shall not do any work that reminds
[2:02:26] you of of slavery. You won't do any work
[2:02:29] that reminds you of the work you're
[2:02:30] doing now.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; You'll do no work on that eighth day
[2:02:34] because we've passed from that. We've
[2:02:36] passed from time into the eighth day.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; And this is not a message for time
[2:02:42] alone. This is a message to call you out
[2:02:45] of your old religion and call you out of
[2:02:48] your old life and call you out of your
[2:02:50] bondage and to loose you from the grip
[2:02:52] of Satan. But it's also a message to
[2:02:54] take you in because the messenger was
[2:02:57] one in the breach of time from time into
[2:03:00] eternity.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Do you believe me?
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; I sat as close as brother Tom is to me
[2:03:09] right now and and brother Brandon would
[2:03:11] say, "I'm in two worlds."
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; Which world was he in? He was in this
[2:03:17] one and he was in the eternal realm.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why he could tell
[2:03:21] the person what you did last week.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; What you did just before you came to the
[2:03:25] service. You you slid a chair out in
[2:03:27] your bedroom and you you sat there. You
[2:03:30] kneel there and prayed and you prayed
[2:03:32] that I would call you.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; He said to one woman, "Do you want me to
[2:03:35] tell you what you prayed?"
[2:03:38] [Applause]
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "You've been to you've been to
[2:03:41] the doctors." He said, "Two large men,
[2:03:43] quite large men. They're doctors." He
[2:03:45] says, and he said, "Do you want me to
[2:03:48] tell you what's on your report?"
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; And then go and tell her what's going to
[2:03:53] be in the where is he? He's in eternity.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; To all the Catholic people that might
[2:04:02] ever listen to this, they never had a
[2:04:04] pope do such a thing.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Never had a prespter do, never had a
[2:04:08] general overseer of the Pentecostal
[2:04:09] assemblies do the do such a thing. We
[2:04:12] are following. Are we following a
[2:04:13] message? Yes, we are.
[2:04:15] by a vindicated prophet.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; And I'm not ashamed of that message in
[2:04:20] the messenger.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a what a gift from God
[2:04:24] that he would call you and I
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; such as we are into such a into such a
[2:04:30] realm
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; so he said let's take the last feast and
[2:04:37] we we read that
[2:04:40] now we got an eighth day
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; on the eighth day
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; and he says now there's only seven days
[2:04:46] but here we speak of the eighth day a
[2:04:48] holy convocation the eighth day is what
[2:04:51] back to the first day. What it speaks of
[2:04:54] eternity as she rolls around without a
[2:04:56] stopping place. Notice it also is upon
[2:04:59] the eighth day, the last day of the
[2:05:01] feast of the tabernacle. Notice after
[2:05:03] that, after the last feast day, after
[2:05:06] the last church age, after the last
[2:05:08] complete seven days upon the earth,
[2:05:10] after the millennium, that this holy
[2:05:12] convocation comes.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; For in the millennium, the Bible said
[2:05:16] they shall build houses and they shall
[2:05:18] inhabit them. But in the new earth, it's
[2:05:20] already went and prepared the place.
[2:05:22] It's built. We have nothing to do with
[2:05:25] the building of it.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; A holy convocation. The eighth day,
[2:05:31] which there's only seven days. Then on
[2:05:33] the eighth day, which comes back to the
[2:05:35] first day again, comes right back to the
[2:05:37] first day. The eighth day is a holy
[2:05:39] convocation.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Eight days deals with the new creation,
[2:05:46] not old creation. 8 days is a new
[2:05:48] creation. For it was on the eighth day
[2:05:50] that our Lord Jesus raised from the
[2:05:52] dead. Hallelujah. He never went back to
[2:05:54] that grave.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; He never went back to that tomb. He
[2:05:58] never went back to Calvary or Golgatha.
[2:06:00] He was a new creation.
[2:06:02] [Music]
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Eighth day, which is a holy convocation,
[2:06:09] which is the first day. You've done pass
[2:06:11] through time and dropped into eternity
[2:06:14] again. Not the keeping of days and
[2:06:17] keeping of Sabbath and new moons and
[2:06:19] things like that, but have passed
[2:06:21] changed your form. Not annihilated, but
[2:06:24] passed from death unto eternal.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; Not will be, we have passed.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; And the messenger came to let us know
[2:06:34] that we those that have eternal life
[2:06:36] have always had eternal life. You've
[2:06:38] always been eternal. He just came to
[2:06:41] tell you you are eternal.
[2:06:46] [Music]
[2:06:47] [Applause]
[2:06:49] Hallelujah.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; Help me out. I'm trying to go quickly
[2:06:56] here now so you can be done. And you
[2:06:59] shall count on you.
[2:07:01] You shall count unto you from the
[2:07:03] tomorrow after the Sabbath, from the day
[2:07:06] that you brought the sheath of the wave
[2:07:08] offering. Now we're to the wave sheath.
[2:07:11] You shall count. This is another part of
[2:07:13] the scripture. You shall count.
[2:07:16] Leviticus the 15th verse of chapter 23.
[2:07:19] You shall count unto you from the
[2:07:22] tomorrow after the Sabbath.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; From the day that you brought the sheath
[2:07:26] of the wave offering, seven Sabbath
[2:07:29] shall be complete.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; After 50 days or seven Sabbaths, Brother
[2:07:36] Brandham said, from there again there
[2:07:39] come another holy convocation. what
[2:07:42] happened? The Holy Ghost fell on the day
[2:07:44] of Pentecost on the eighth day.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And Christ uh was the
[2:07:50] first one to raise from all the prophets
[2:07:53] and so forth." He was the first fruits
[2:07:55] of those that slept in the Bible in the
[2:07:58] bride coming of Christ coming out of the
[2:08:01] church. There will have to be a sheath
[2:08:04] waved again in the last days.
[2:08:08] There will have to be a sheath waved
[2:08:10] again in the last days.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; Who was the sheath that was waved
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; at the resurrection?
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Was Christ in another form?
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Put on your thinking cap now.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; And there'll have to be another one.
[2:08:30] He's making an announcement. The message
[2:08:32] is full of announcements. And there'll
[2:08:34] have to be another chief wave. Now, this
[2:08:37] is in the rising of the sun. There'll
[2:08:38] have to be another wave sheath coming in
[2:08:41] this bride coming of Christ and the
[2:08:43] fullness of the word. It couldn't come
[2:08:45] till the seals were opened because the
[2:08:47] sheath is Christ.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; And that's why he preached the second
[2:08:51] crucifixion of Jesus Christ. And that's
[2:08:54] why he preached, I indict this
[2:08:56] generation, not that generation or
[2:08:59] another one coming. I indict this
[2:09:01] generation for the second crucifixion of
[2:09:04] Jesus Christ because the word come and
[2:09:06] they crucified it.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; But when they crucified him that time,
[2:09:14] did it stop him?
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Say it again. Did it stop him? No. It
[2:09:19] never stopped him. He just continued on
[2:09:21] with the program. He was buried and
[2:09:24] raised again. And not only raised again,
[2:09:26] then he was raised according to this
[2:09:28] scripture in Leviticus as a memorial to
[2:09:31] God.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; And he was waved over the people.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; That there were more like him still in
[2:09:38] the field.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was waved over this earth.
[2:09:44] He dropped his blood on it first. Then
[2:09:46] he raised in the resurrection and was
[2:09:48] waved over it. And when he ascended, he
[2:09:51] was waved over it. Father, there's more
[2:09:53] like me.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; There's more like me.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; There's more word in flesh down there.
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; There's others that are going to live
[2:10:04] being the word in flesh.
[2:10:06] [Applause]
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; Waving the sheath. What was the chief?
[2:10:23] The first one that come to mature. The
[2:10:25] first one that proved it was a wheat.
[2:10:28] That proved it was a
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; chief.
[2:10:37] He said if there would be a holy ritual,
[2:10:40] it should come forth on the Sabbath,
[2:10:44] which was the seventh day of the week,
[2:10:47] which is Saturday. But did you notice in
[2:10:49] this memorial to wave it on the first
[2:10:51] day of the week the sheath which was the
[2:10:54] first of your seed that you planted when
[2:10:57] it comes up and ripens you cut it down
[2:11:01] this sheath and take it to the priest
[2:11:03] and let him take it and wave it before
[2:11:06] the Lord for your acceptation that you
[2:11:10] are accepted.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; You were accepted before you were born.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:11:19] [Applause]
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; You were accepted when you were laying
[2:11:25] in the earth.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; Before your body was formed,
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; before your father put seed in your
[2:11:32] mother's womb, you were accepted.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; And the accepted one will never be
[2:11:38] discredited and set aside. You're
[2:11:40] accepted.
[2:11:44] Now, for those of you for the younger
[2:11:46] ones, I've said this many times before,
[2:11:48] but I'll just go over it very, very
[2:11:49] quickly because I'm trying to watch my
[2:11:51] time. I didn't have my watch on.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; The scripture says this,
[2:11:58] when you come into the land,
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; so it didn't put a special day on. It
[2:12:02] says, "When you come into the land and
[2:12:04] you've sew in your fields,
[2:12:08] the first ripe grain, the first ripe
[2:12:11] grain, because it was all Christ,
[2:12:14] the first ripe one was the first one who
[2:12:16] came to maturity, the first one who
[2:12:18] could prove, as brother Brandham says,
[2:12:20] the first one that could prove he was a
[2:12:22] wheat."
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Now, that was back there.
[2:12:27] That is why when you read the messages,
[2:12:30] you'll hear the prophet say, "Now, if I
[2:12:34] have told you the truth,
[2:12:37] let him come now and prove
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; I told you the truth." In other words,
[2:12:42] if I have spoke the ripe grain to you,
[2:12:45] if I've presented the wheat sheath to
[2:12:48] you, if I've presented the absolute
[2:12:50] truth to you, then let him who gave the
[2:12:53] word come and prove it.
[2:12:56] And did he? Every time. Every time.
[2:12:59] Every time he proved it.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; So there had to be another chief at this
[2:13:03] time. That's why he said there had to be
[2:13:04] another one at this time. But if you
[2:13:06] live back then, your parents, he says,
[2:13:09] "When you come into the land," because
[2:13:10] they, you know, it it wasn't a certain
[2:13:12] day they came in when they came in. Then
[2:13:14] they planted their field,
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; And then the grain grew. But if you've
[2:13:20] been around on a farm, it never all
[2:13:23] ripens at the same time. There'll be
[2:13:25] some that comes ripe first.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; And you take that first one, that first
[2:13:31] sheath, and you cut it down because that
[2:13:34] was to that would to describe explicitly
[2:13:39] that Christ would be the first one to
[2:13:41] come to maturity and they cut him down.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; He was cut down
[2:13:48] to the cross and to death
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; and they had to play a part in that.
[2:13:54] Why? It was your sins and mine that put
[2:13:57] them there.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; So, you play a part in it.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; And you cut the sheath down. And when
[2:14:04] you've cut the sheath down,
[2:14:07] don't take it to Oh, man.
[2:14:11] If you were here for a second season,
[2:14:13] second session this afternoon, I could
[2:14:15] start right now. You don't take it to
[2:14:17] the prophet.
[2:14:20] He didn't say go and take this to Moses
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; or go and take it to Joshua. Moses
[2:14:25] wasn't there yet. He didn't say take it
[2:14:27] to someone else. You take it to the
[2:14:29] priest.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus could not do this as the God
[2:14:37] prophet.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; He had to die, shed his blood, take his
[2:14:42] own blood, ascend it, and then be waved
[2:14:45] over the people because it was only the
[2:14:47] priest that could wave it.
[2:14:49] Amen.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; At the beginning of the priesthood, he
[2:14:52] waved it.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; At the beginning of the priesthood,
[2:14:56] there was a waving that there was more
[2:14:58] like him. But at the end,
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; at the end of mercy and at the end of
[2:15:05] the priesthood comes the full word
[2:15:07] again. And that's why Jesus said, "Who
[2:15:09] is this MelzDC? It's another priesthood.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Not Aaron. But who's this Melzdc? Who is
[2:15:16] this one that's showing himself? Who did
[2:15:18] she touch? opportunity touch the high
[2:15:20] priest, but it was the ending of mercy
[2:15:23] at the ending of the age.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; Don't get me wrong now, but at the end
[2:15:28] of the age, there had to be another
[2:15:30] waving
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; because now the full word had come, had
[2:15:33] been crucified, cut down, and they
[2:15:35] couldn't stop it.
[2:15:37] [Music]
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; They said all kinds of nasty things.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; You folks to live through it all. When
[2:15:46] we gathered in the little house, Brother
[2:15:48] Don, Sister Gur were there, few others
[2:15:51] perhaps, Sister Violet Law,
[2:15:55] they called us tapeworms,
[2:15:59] these po people to go
[2:16:03] and they listened to tapes and they made
[2:16:06] it as spooky as they could and they shut
[2:16:07] off all the lights.
[2:16:14] Isn't that what they said?
[2:16:18] And they they shut off all the lights in
[2:16:20] the darkness and they don't believe in
[2:16:23] music
[2:16:25] and they're a weird cult and they made
[2:16:28] it as spooky as possible and they're a
[2:16:31] bunch of tapeworms.
[2:16:33] Well, one lady finally one lady came in
[2:16:36] one day and she sat down and we were in
[2:16:39] the log church then and she heard the
[2:16:41] people singing their lungs out and heard
[2:16:42] them playing their music and heard them
[2:16:44] shouting and they're praising God like
[2:16:46] she she came up to me. She says, "I
[2:16:48] heard that you people don't believe in
[2:16:50] music." I said, "Where'd you hear that?"
[2:16:52] Well, she says, "Some people told me you
[2:16:54] don't believe in music." I said, "Of
[2:16:55] course we believe in music." What? And
[2:16:58] she was so moved by the whole thing. I
[2:17:00] tell you one thing, she knew that
[2:17:02] whoever spoke to her was telling lies
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; and it still carries on
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; what what these people are.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; All these people,
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad I'm one of them.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; All right, I'm just finishing right now
[2:17:26] for your acceptation.
[2:17:28] He said, "Notice it was the first of
[2:17:30] God, the first corn of God's wheat that
[2:17:33] had been raised from the dead by God's
[2:17:35] quickening power. God had quickened his
[2:17:37] life, raised him from the dead. He was
[2:17:39] the first fruits of them that slept. He
[2:17:42] was that she chief. That's why they had
[2:17:44] to wave that sheath for it was the first
[2:17:47] one that came to maturity. It was the
[2:17:49] first one." I will say this,
[2:17:54] I'm coming to a close just now in a
[2:17:55] couple minutes.
[2:18:00] I want you to take this real serious.
[2:18:04] Jesus was the sinless.
[2:18:09] He was the sinless son of God, tempted
[2:18:13] in all points like you and I are and yet
[2:18:16] without sin.
[2:18:20] and he was the first sheath that came to
[2:18:23] maturity and was cut down and waved
[2:18:26] before God. But that was not God's whole
[2:18:29] program.
[2:18:32] God wanted to take a sinner
[2:18:35] that had been cleansed by the blood of
[2:18:37] this lamb.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; He wanted to take a sinner that even
[2:18:41] tried to commit suicide.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; He wanted to take a sinner that hated
[2:18:46] people.
[2:18:47] He wanted to take a sinner as brother
[2:18:49] Brennham said he was a sinner
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; and he tried attempted to do these
[2:18:53] things and then then and then one day
[2:18:55] but God's hand was on him
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; and God wanted to take a sinner and
[2:19:00] bring him to that full maturity
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; so that we would see hey it's not just
[2:19:05] Jesus Christ someone who came from
[2:19:07] heaven's uh glories hey God can take a
[2:19:10] sinner
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of a sinner
[2:19:13] you've been I don't care what you've
[2:19:15] done God want to break a sinner.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; That's his pleasure.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; His pleasure is the cross work, the
[2:19:23] sacrifice work. He can take a sinner and
[2:19:26] bring him to full redemption
[2:19:28] [Applause]
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; and bring them to maturity.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; Then we understand more what it's like
[2:19:35] to say to be like Jesus.
[2:19:41] Now the last the last one
[2:19:45] believing and it was waved as a memorial
[2:19:48] of thanksgiving to God believing that
[2:19:51] the rest of them would come. I say to
[2:19:54] you to those that are streaming
[2:19:57] to all who will ever hear this voice and
[2:20:00] they have come.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; I want you to get beyond that you're
[2:20:05] just part of a church or part of Bible
[2:20:07] way or any other church. You're part of
[2:20:09] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; They're in Bolivia. They're in Peru.
[2:20:14] They're in Argentina. They're in South
[2:20:16] Africa. They're in Zambia. They're in uh
[2:20:19] they're in Nairobi. They're all over the
[2:20:22] world. They're in Nigeria. They're in
[2:20:24] Congo. They're in Belgium. They're in
[2:20:27] France. They're in Germany. They're in
[2:20:29] Russia. They're in the Ukraine. They're
[2:20:31] all over. It's a glorious bride of Jesus
[2:20:33] Christ
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; to your friends. Brother Brandma crossed
[2:20:39] over and he saw millions,
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; millions.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "I saw you all there."
[2:20:51] [Music]
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; I just want to ask you, did he see you?
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; Does your faith say he saw me?
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; This messenger saw me?
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, that's too great." Did God
[2:21:06] see you then? Amen.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; God saw you.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; You're part of that number.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; We have a reason to rejoice.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; We have a reason to shout.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:20] [Music]
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; They screamed and threw their toques in
[2:21:24] the air and everything else at the
[2:21:26] Olympics. The Olympics. What's the
[2:21:27] Olympics?
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; Olympics is nothing.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; All the games are nothing.
[2:21:34] We're in the greatest race of all time.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; And God chose for you to be here at the
[2:21:40] very last lap.
[2:21:42] [Music]
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; You talk about the podium. We're going
[2:21:45] to stand on the podium.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; Having overcome the devil.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; And sin,
[2:21:55] the deceiver.
[2:21:59] [Music]
[2:22:01] You think that Jesus was waved in vain?
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; No, he was not waved in vain. He was he
[2:22:06] was he was waved because the the the
[2:22:08] people were there in the field and now
[2:22:10] we've come.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; If it was a memorial to God then,
[2:22:15] forgive me for just taking this minute,
[2:22:16] but if it was a memorial to God then and
[2:22:18] God rejoiced in that memorial, think
[2:22:20] think what he what what's in the heart
[2:22:22] of God when he sees the product of it.
[2:22:24] [Music]
[2:22:27] And
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; here's the last one. You
[2:22:31] You came by predestination.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; And there's the genuine holy
[2:22:38] convocation.
[2:22:39] [Applause]
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; We're entering the holy convocation.
[2:22:43] We're entering into that real genuine
[2:22:45] eternity
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; where the church is called not some
[2:22:48] station or some denomination, but into
[2:22:51] eternity where with their eternal king.
[2:22:54] We don't have it uh at all. He said,
[2:22:57] "Why don't we have it at have it have it
[2:22:59] at all? There's no such a thing as days
[2:23:02] and things of times. You've passed into
[2:23:04] eternity where you come from."
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; You were there to begin with.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; Future home.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Future home.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; That's why you've been called.
[2:23:22] I think we ought to stand and sing.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; Uh either the young people sang it the
[2:23:28] other day
[2:23:30] and I I I don't have all the words but
[2:23:32] all I have in it I have that phrase
[2:23:35] shout hallelujah.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's say thank you Jesus.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I want to shout
[2:23:48] hallelujah.
[2:23:50] You know that it's good after you heard
[2:23:51] the word to worship.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Let's just worship for a few moments.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; Let our spirits enter into worship.

[2:24:10] here?

[2:24:13] I'm just made up so that when I sing,
[2:24:17] the Bible says we do it with all of our
[2:24:19] heart.
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; We've got something wonderful to
[2:24:24] worship for.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:24:35] When I think about the Lord,
[2:24:41] how he saved me, how he raised me, how
[2:24:46] he filled me with the Holy Ghost, how he
[2:24:52] healed me to the other.
[2:24:57] When I think about the Lord,
[2:25:02] how he takes me up, turn me around, how
[2:25:08] he
[2:25:12] solid ground.

[2:25:30] all the honor and all the praise.

[2:25:51] all the honor and all the praise.
[2:25:56] Hallelujah.

[2:27:02] Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus for
[2:27:08] all the glory for all the honor and all
[2:27:13] the praise.
[2:27:15] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:27:20] I want to sing one of them. I'm so glad
[2:27:22] I'm one of them.
[2:27:26] before we're dismissed for a short while
[2:27:29] and coming back this evening and
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; those are going to be baptized. I
[2:27:35] believe it's going to be a glorious
[2:27:36] time.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; But I think we need to sing and worship.
[2:27:40] There's people almost everywhere and
[2:27:42] they are
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; whose hearts are all a flame with the
[2:27:48] fire that fell at Pentecost. Didn't only
[2:27:51] fall pentecost, it fell here.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing a verse or two.
[2:28:03] [Applause]

[2:28:37] My soul that I can say I'm going to
[2:28:42] [Applause]
[2:28:43] all these people may not be normal.
[2:28:56] [Music]
[2:29:06] [Applause]
[2:29:16] Ille
[2:29:29] see this blessing that will cleanse your
[2:29:31] heart from sin that will start your
[2:29:35] ring. Yeah.
[2:29:38] Heat.
[2:29:46] [Music]
[2:29:48] Yeah. Heat.
[2:29:55] [Music]
[2:29:59] Heat. Heat.
[2:30:04] [Music]
[2:30:14] Hallelujah.
[2:30:17] [Music]
[2:30:19] [Applause]
[2:30:23] I'm going to ask a brother Peter Ivano,
[2:30:26] brother Peter, if you'll come and ask
[2:30:28] God's blessing upon the people. As I was
[2:30:30] just coming to church about 10:00 here,
[2:30:31] brother uh brother Peter and his wife
[2:30:35] and twin boys are walking up the
[2:30:36] sidewalk. I just said, "Well, you
[2:30:38] started early this morning."
[2:30:41] Driving about three hours. They started
[2:30:43] early. And we appreciate that. Let's
[2:30:46] pray for brother Peter. He has applied
[2:30:48] for his visa to be able to go to Moscow.
[2:30:52] And I really had it on my heart for him
[2:30:54] to go. And uh uh I don't know, they're
[2:30:58] taking their time, but let's pray that
[2:31:00] visa will come through. Ours just came
[2:31:03] through in the last few days. Brother
[2:31:06] Kim, brother uh brother Randy and
[2:31:08] brother Milco, some that are going,
[2:31:11] Brother Machmood and his wife are going
[2:31:14] and I'm so happy about that. I was asked
[2:31:16] by brother Giddo Vbront
[2:31:19] Bront uh who all was going and then he
[2:31:22] decided he wanted to go. I think maybe
[2:31:24] his wife and brother Peter is going,
[2:31:27] Lord willing. And I believe that that's
[2:31:30] God's plan.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. be a great boost and a great
[2:31:34] encouragement to the people there in
[2:31:36] Russia. Just think of it as the first
[2:31:39] time they've had a had a place where
[2:31:40] they all gather together and worship.
[2:31:43] It's going to be really wonderful. We'll
[2:31:44] sing the course once more as Brother
[2:31:46] Peter comes. I'm one of them.
[2:31:49] Hallelujah. One of them. Praise God. I'm
[2:31:53] so glad that I can say I'm one of them.
[2:31:57] Hallelujah. One of them. Hallelujah. One
[2:32:01] of them.
[2:32:02] God.
[2:32:09] [Applause]
[2:32:10] [Music]
[2:32:16] [Applause]
[2:32:20] Heat.
[2:32:27] Say,
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; you sang it pretty good here, but we're
[2:32:34] going to sing it on the other side.
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; We'll all get together and just see. I
[2:32:38] think we'll even do better.
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; God bless you all, brother Peter. God
[2:32:42] bless you. Ask God's blessing upon us.
[2:32:46] Our heavenly father,
[2:32:48] what a privilege it is, Father, to be
[2:32:50] here in the house of God,
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; to worship you, Father, to express our
[2:32:57] love and joy
[2:33:00] and to say, "Thank you for everything
[2:33:01] that you have done, Lord Jesus, because
[2:33:03] we could see through the messenger that
[2:33:06] you've you brought for this age, Father,
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; and he's he's he came and he announced
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; that he's seen us already there, that
[2:33:14] we're with him there. We we're crying
[2:33:16] out. We're saying our precious brother
[2:33:19] and we stand upon that because he said
[2:33:21] that Paul and Peter that be judged and
[2:33:23] he said I preached exactly I preached
[2:33:25] everything that they have preached and
[2:33:27] he said and those people yelled out and
[2:33:29] they said we stand upon that Lord Jesus
[2:33:31] and we stand upon it this this this
[2:33:33] morning and we're so happy and excited
[2:33:35] Lord Jesus that you sent a faithful
[2:33:37] messenger Lord Jesus and in the book of
[2:33:39] Revelation you said I am the faithful
[2:33:41] witness Lord Jesus. You are faithful,
[2:33:44] Lord God. And we're standing upon
[2:33:45] faithful word and believe in faithful
[2:33:48] messenger, Lord Jesus, that he this word
[2:33:50] will produce that faithful bride, Lord
[2:33:52] God, that will not waver, that will not
[2:33:54] follow any any doctrine, but will stand
[2:33:56] true to this word, Lord Jesus. We're so
[2:33:59] thankful to you, Father, for the message
[2:34:00] this morning that we we could see if we
[2:34:03] could realize who we are that that you
[2:34:05] came and you fulfilled the Old
[2:34:07] Testament. You fulfilled the law and the
[2:34:09] prophets and you were the fulfillment.
[2:34:11] you as if the last as the last drop of
[2:34:14] that of the fulfillment of the time for
[2:34:17] that generation, Lord Jesus. And this
[2:34:19] time, we see that we are the fulfillment
[2:34:21] of the work for this day. We are the
[2:34:24] bride. We're the last voice for this
[2:34:25] last age, Lord Jesus. We believe that
[2:34:28] we're the fulfillment. We're the
[2:34:29] consummation, Lord Jesus, of all the
[2:34:31] time, Lord God. We we're so thankful to
[2:34:34] you that you've chosen us to live in
[2:34:36] this generation, not in the generation
[2:34:38] of Lutheran or Wesley, Lord Jesus, but
[2:34:40] in this generation to produce, to show
[2:34:43] and prove to this world that there will
[2:34:44] be a bride that will be spotless without
[2:34:47] spot or wrinkle wrinkle, Lord Jesus.
[2:34:49] We're so grateful to you for that. Thank
[2:34:51] you for everything you have done. Thank
[2:34:53] you for the message of the hour. Thank
[2:34:54] you for the word that you've sent for
[2:34:56] this day, Lord Jesus. And we may we
[2:34:58] accept it and believe it that we are
[2:35:00] that we are the the word father accept
[2:35:03] expressed in this generation. We believe
[2:35:06] it. We accept it Lord Jesus. May you use
[2:35:08] your use these vessels these bodies
[2:35:10] father. May you prove your word through

[2:35:23] you may you pour may you just pour
[2:35:26] yourself out, Father, through through
[2:35:28] our lives. And may you refill those who
[2:35:30] pour out their lives, Lord Jesus, to
[2:35:32] bring your word, to bring
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; encouragement, Father, forever for
[2:35:37] everyone that's here, Lord God.
