[3:32] anything, Lord, but lift our hands to
[3:35] you, say, "Thank you, God.

[4:04] Amen. And we've got a number of prayer
[4:05] requests here this morning and we can't
[4:08] uh
[4:10] take them all, but we want to remember
[4:13] brother Tony who's away.
[4:17] Brother Ivans requested prayer for the
[4:19] church in the central China.
[4:22] Uh brother Gilbert from Saudi Arabia who
[4:25] was here uh was carjacked. They've gone
[4:29] through a very traumatic time. We want
[4:30] to remember them this morning.
[4:33] And uh I want to remember brother Dan
[4:35] Daisley in prayer.
[4:37] And uh if you've got any other needs
[4:39] this morning, you just lift it before
[4:40] the Lord. We go to prayer. Amen. He
[4:42] knows every need. Amen. Every single
[4:45] need this morning that's here.
[4:48] I want to bring them before him this
[4:50] morning. If you're listening in on the
[4:51] internet, you've got a need to just lift
[4:53] it before the Lord this morning. I'm
[4:54] going to ask Brother Dier, Brother DJ,
[4:56] if you'd come and open the service in a
[4:58] word of prayer.
[5:10] Gracious Father,
[5:14] surely this morning we come to
[5:18] recognize you as the great one among us,
[5:20] Lord,
[5:22] the allsufficient one,
[5:25] the great I am,
[5:27] the almighty God.
[5:30] There's no one beside you.
[5:34] We're so glad that you're alive and well
[5:36] this morning.
[5:38] We're so glad you made yourself
[5:40] accessible to us, Father.
[5:43] As we come this morning, Lord,
[5:46] our voices lifting up to you.
[5:50] You're the only one, Father, that
[5:51] deserve our praise, our adoration.
[5:54] You deserve our love. You deserve our
[5:57] devotion.
[5:58] You deserve our consecration, Father.
[6:01] You deserve our own lives. So we lay
[6:04] them all at your feet today. We say,
[6:07] Father, receive them as a sweet smelling
[6:10] incense as we give ourselves without
[6:13] reservation today. Lord, we have come to
[6:16] honor you, the great God of our
[6:17] salvation. You're the one who has
[6:20] redeemed our lives. You're the one who
[6:22] has purchased us. Oh God, you're the one
[6:25] who paid the price and called us your
[6:27] bride in this hour. How you came back to
[6:30] claim us, oh God, as your purchased
[6:32] possession. We pray this morning, you
[6:35] richly dwell inside of every hearts
[6:37] today. Lord, we want you to have your
[6:40] preeminence once again. For without you,
[6:42] we confess we can do nothing. Lord, we
[6:45] have nothing in our hands that we bring.
[6:47] Father, we only look to the cross of
[6:50] Calvary where the enmity was removed,
[6:53] where the veil was rent, oh God, where
[6:55] the way back to the Holy of Holy was
[6:57] made accessible to a people, oh God,
[7:00] that have been called and redeemed to be
[7:02] priests and kings in this hour. Lord, to
[7:05] have dominion over sin, death, hell, and
[7:07] the grave, to raise triumphant, Father,
[7:10] in this darkened day. Father, we know
[7:13] that your light has shone inside of us.
[7:15] Oh God, we thank you for the quickening
[7:18] power. We thank you Lord for your
[7:20] delivering power dear Jesus that have
[7:23] broken the the wages of sin from our
[7:26] lives that has delivered us oh God to
[7:29] allow us to worship you this morning in
[7:31] spirit and in truth. Angel cannot oh God
[7:35] even touch the worship that your bride
[7:37] can bring to you this morning because
[7:39] she can sing the song of redemption and
[7:42] grace. She recognized Lord that she has
[7:44] been redeemed by the precious blood of
[7:47] the lamb of God. So we thank you this
[7:50] morning. How we magnify your name. How
[7:53] we celebrate you Jesus. How we bless
[7:56] you, oh God. How we lift up your holy
[7:58] name. There's no God like our God.
[8:01] Eternal mighty indeed. Oh Jesus. Move
[8:05] among us today. Have your preeminence.
[8:07] Lord, you know every need in divine
[8:10] presence. We just believe in you.
[8:12] There's no God like you. You alone can
[8:15] touch our lives. You alone can make a
[8:18] difference. Lord, we have not come to
[8:20] see men today. Let your servant as the
[8:23] voice of God will go forth. That
[8:25] resurrection voice, that voice that
[8:27] called Lazarus, that same voice that
[8:29] called Simon, Lord, we believe we're
[8:31] here to hear you. Call us, Father, to
[8:34] that sacred place where we can be
[8:36] ministered to, where, oh God, our needs
[8:39] can be met, where our souls can be
[8:41] strengthened, where we can, oh God, feel
[8:43] the tender hand of Jehovah, just leading
[8:46] us on into total and complete victory.
[8:49] Those that are sick and body, we believe
[8:52] you're the great physician. Touch them
[8:54] this morning. I pray our brother Dan
[8:56] Dasley, your precious servant. Lord,
[8:59] we're holding him up before you this
[9:00] morning, knowing that your arm is not
[9:02] too short to reach to where he is.
[9:04] Father, he's been looking to you, oh
[9:07] God. When science has failed, our God
[9:09] never fails. So we ask, come and oh God,
[9:13] by his sight today and just remember
[9:15] him. Raise him up, Father. Deliver him
[9:18] so completely that your name can be
[9:21] glorified among the saint. As we hear
[9:23] the testimony, Father, we remember the
[9:26] church in China this morning. your
[9:28] people, oh God, under such oppression.
[9:31] But you're the God that delivers your
[9:33] people, Father. So be the portion at
[9:35] this time. Yes, oh God, give them
[9:37] strength and courage to stand in their
[9:39] lot and know that God will deliver them
[9:42] so completely and will prove himself
[9:45] strong on behalf of those that trust in
[9:48] him. Have your way this morning, Lord.
[9:50] Our brother Tony, we pray that you'll
[9:52] continue to be with him. Oh Jesus, we
[9:55] just want you, Father, to comfort our
[9:57] brother Gilbert and his wife, Father,
[10:00] having gone through such a traumatic
[10:01] experience, but we're so glad that you
[10:04] preserve their lives. Oh God, we just
[10:06] give you thanks this morning, Lord. We
[10:08] love you. We just feel so undeserving to
[10:11] stand in your presence, Lord. But we
[10:13] know you have something good in store
[10:15] for us this morning, Lord. So we ask
[10:17] that you remove every hindrance. Let the
[10:20] enemy, oh God, be put to flight today.
[10:22] That a word, father, be victorious as it
[10:26] get delivered by your servant. We want
[10:29] it to touch every heart to strengthen
[10:31] your people and that you can be
[10:33] glorified this morning as we commit the
[10:35] service to you. The singing, the praise,
[10:38] the worship, Father, and everyone at the
[10:41] post of duty, remember us this morning,
[10:43] Lord. We are your people, oh God, and we
[10:46] depend upon you. Let this meeting father
[10:49] be beneficial today to each one that has
[10:52] come to the glory of Jesus Christ. We
[10:55] commit it to you and we thank you in
[10:57] Jesus name. Amen.
[11:02] Man, you can have your seats this
[11:04] morning.
[11:20] Man, we want to welcome all those who
[11:21] are visiting with us and uh
[11:25] special welcome this morning uh brother
[11:27] Matthew
[11:30] Tudis, I believe it is, from Germany.
[11:32] Can we get you to stand up?
[11:35] Amen. We're happy to have you here,
[11:37] brother. God bless you. And also, we
[11:40] have visiting with us, uh, from Brother
[11:42] Donnie Reagan's church in Tennessee,

[11:47] them to stand. They are.
[11:52] Amen. God bless you. God bless you.
[11:58] Um, we've got a song this morning from
[12:01] Brother Matthew Wilson. Brother Matthew,
[12:03] why don't you come? And while he's uh
[12:06] coming and getting ready, let's sing uh
[12:08] Mercy Rope My Life.
[12:11] Aren't you glad for his mercy in your
[12:13] life, saints?
[12:18] Mercy
[12:20] rules my life.
[12:25] His mercy
[12:28] re
[12:35] I should have called
[12:38] my soul
[12:40] cast down
[12:46] my life.
[12:49] Oh yes, his mercy.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; It rewrote
[12:55] my life.
[12:59] His mercy
[13:02] re
[13:04] my life.
[13:08] I should have fallen. My soul
[13:14] cast down
[13:16] by the grace.
[13:19] of my
[13:22] [Music]
[13:36] [Music]
[13:47] [Music]
[13:56] I thought I had learned to love the
[13:59] unlovable after I became a Christian.
[14:05] But the mountain I'm facing is higher
[14:09] than that. It's like starting all over
[14:12] again.
[14:15] This mountain so high it blocks out the
[14:19] sky. There's no way of going around.
[14:24] But that's not going to stop me. I'll go
[14:27] over the top. See a believer will never
[14:31] back down.
[14:34] And I'll be one step closer to Jesus.
[14:39] A little bit closer to home.
[14:44] I'll have one more test like all of the
[14:47] rest behind me where it belongs.
[14:53] As my journey gets longer, my faith
[14:56] getting stronger by hacking away with
[15:00] the sword
[15:02] up slippery slopes without a ropes just
[15:09] my Lord.
[15:12] [Music]
[15:21] [Music]
[15:30] God's prophet told me God's working to
[15:34] mold me cuz only pure love can go in.
[15:39] So he's shaping and grinding, honing,
[15:43] refining. Third, pulling me out of my
[15:47] sin.
[15:50] Following the Lord and the crossing of
[15:53] Jordan is really just dying to self.
[15:58] It's Jesus beside me. His word down
[16:02] inside me redeeming a part of himself.
[16:08] Bring me one step closer, Lord Jesus.
[16:12] A little bit closer to home.
[16:17] Let me have one more test. Like all of
[16:20] the rest behind me where it belongs.
[16:26] As my journey gets longer, my faith's
[16:29] getting stronger by cutting away with a
[16:33] sword.
[16:35] of life's slippery slopes without axes
[16:38] or ropes. Just the strong hand of Jesus,
[16:42] my Lord.
[16:44] And I'm one step closer, Lord Jesus.
[16:49] I'm a little bit closer to home.
[16:53] I have one more test like all of the
[16:57] rest behind me where it belongs.
[17:02] As my journey gets longer, my faith
[17:06] getting stronger because I'm believer
[17:11] [Music]
[17:22] creating another black eye for Satan.
[17:29] By the hand of Jesus, my Lord.
[17:33] By the strong hand of Jesus, my Lord.
[17:38] By the strong hand of Jesus, my Lord.
[17:52] Thank you, brother Matthew.
[17:57] Sometimes it seems on the side of a
[17:59] cliff. No axes, no ropes. Brother Ken
[18:02] and I had been there. Remember that
[18:04] time, Brother Ken?
[18:08] About 800 feet or more up this cliff, no
[18:12] ropes, no proper equipment, just before
[18:15] brother Ken got married. And I'm very
[18:18] thankful that the Lord brought us
[18:20] through unscathed.
[18:24] But sometimes it's like that in this
[18:25] life. Amen. seem like you're out there
[18:28] all by yourself and there's no way out.
[18:30] I'm thankful for the Lord's watch and
[18:33] care. Amen.
[18:38] You are my all and all. Let's sing it
[18:39] together as brother Wesal is going to
[18:41] come and bless us with a song.
[18:44] [Music]
[18:52] When I am weak, you are the treure that
[18:57] I seek. You are my
[19:01] inordious.
[19:03] [Music]
[19:12] I want the Holy Ghost to rule. You are
[19:17] my

[20:37] he? Amen.
[20:48] [Music]

[21:09] is in his holy temple.

[21:17] is on his heavenly throne.
[21:24] We bring
[21:26] our praises unto Jesus
[21:32] for all the love that he has shown.
[21:40] We sense

[21:53] shout.

[30:51] Jesus
[30:53] loves the little children.
[30:58] All the children are
[31:01] [Music]
[31:04] black and white.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus loves the little children of the
[31:12] world.
[31:14] Yes, Jesus
[31:17] loves the little children.
[31:21] All the children,
[31:25] [Music]
[31:28] black and white, they are precious in
[31:31] his sight.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother John. And a
[31:40] great day here.
[31:45] God has blessed
[31:48] Am
[31:52] I there? Good.
[31:55] God has blessed our brother John and
[31:58] sister Leah with a son, two daughters,
[32:02] now a son,
[32:05] and they have named him Lincoln Gage.
[32:09] And uh I'm glad that they gave me the
[32:12] interpretation.
[32:15] Lincoln is a quiet leader.
[32:18] And Gage is dedicated
[32:22] dedicated to an oath or a pledge.
[32:25] And I like that someone who will be
[32:28] dedicated to his oath. And I trust that
[32:32] this young son will make a promise to
[32:34] God that he will be dedicated to that
[32:36] oath and that vow and that promise to
[32:38] God.
[32:40] A scripture we read always
[32:43] and I just want to refer to it. And he
[32:45] took up
[32:47] took them up in his arms and put his
[32:49] hands on them and blessed them.
[32:52] We have no record of
[32:56] the future lives of those children after
[33:00] Jesus took them up in his arms and
[33:02] blessed them. There's nothing written,
[33:04] we have nothing on written record of
[33:07] what took place in the lives of those
[33:10] children.
[33:11] But I can assure you one thing that
[33:14] those children perhaps were not aware of
[33:18] the of the future events or the events
[33:21] that took place in their lives and the
[33:23] things that came by their way which they
[33:27] were not conscious of but were the
[33:29] direct result of this blessing that the
[33:33] Lord Jesus placed upon them. And that
[33:37] blessing was upon them because God put
[33:40] something in the heart of the parents. I
[33:42] want my child. I want my daughter. I
[33:46] want my son blessed of God. Not some
[33:49] little formality. Not some little
[33:51] ceremony in the church. Certainly not
[33:54] some empty tradition, but I want my
[33:57] child blessed of Almighty God.
[34:00] I know that God sees that and God hears
[34:03] that. and uh they would live the rest of
[34:07] their lives not knowing that the
[34:10] benefits that came to them came as a
[34:12] direct result. And I'm praying also that
[34:15] upon Lincoln Gage will come the
[34:19] blessings of almighty God as a result of
[34:21] the faith that is in the mother and
[34:24] father's heart. The Bible said also of
[34:28] the mother of Samson, and the woman bare
[34:31] a son, and called his name Samson, and
[34:35] the child grew, and the Lord blessed
[34:37] him. That's all we're here for.
[34:42] There's a lot of children born in the
[34:44] world. A lot of children come up and
[34:46] have some kind of form of church or
[34:49] religious ceremony. That's not where
[34:52] it's at. We want this last line. And the
[34:55] Lord blessed him. And that's my desire
[34:59] here today. And the Lord bless thee
[35:04] and keep thee is my prayer for Lincoln.
[35:08] The Lord make his face to shine on thee,
[35:12] and be gracious to thee, and the Lord
[35:16] lift up his countenance upon thee, and
[35:18] give thee peace.
[35:21] I pray that the Lord will bless this
[35:23] child with a tender heart towards God.
[35:28] I'm praying that God will bless this
[35:30] child and make him useful and fruitful
[35:33] in the kingdom of God.
[35:36] And I pray that God the greatest
[35:38] blessing that I could invoke
[35:41] is the essence of the word blessed. And
[35:44] the word blessed in the Old Testament
[35:47] comes from eulogy which is we have
[35:49] eulogy
[35:53] which is well done
[35:56] and a spoken word log go. May he hear by
[36:02] a living voice of the Lord Jesus Christ
[36:06] well done. When this life is over and
[36:10] when he needs no more of earth's
[36:11] blessings. We're going to pray God's
[36:13] blessings upon him.
[36:18] Lord, as I hold this son in my arms and
[36:22] Jesus, as you bless the children, I'm a
[36:25] poor substitute for you. But as your
[36:27] servant, I lay my hands upon him and ask
[36:30] your blessing upon him. Lord, I pray
[36:33] that you will, oh God, bless him with
[36:35] health,
[36:37] bless him with strength, make him a
[36:39] blessing in this home. Make him a joy in
[36:41] this home. And above all things, when he
[36:44] comes of age, may he hear your voice and
[36:48] may he say yes at that time, Lord. And
[36:51] as you have given him, Lord, to John and
[36:53] Leo, we dedicate him to you in the name
[36:56] of Jesus Christ. Amen. And may he use
[37:00] this voice for the gospel.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; When I start praying, I will not be
[37:09] defeated.
[37:12] Hallelujah.
[37:14] God bless you, brother John.
[37:17] Give your leadership in this home. How
[37:20] blessed they are. I know how nervous
[37:23] parents get. Oh, I hope my child doesn't
[37:27] squeal or whatever. Uh, don't worry. I I
[37:32] have some amplification here and uh I
[37:34] will just yell over them. I will pray
[37:38] over it anyway. I'm not going to be
[37:40] defeated in my prayer of blessing.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:45] We're so happy we have a second son
[37:49] also. Now, I just take these in the
[37:51] order as they as they call my home. We
[37:54] don't have any preference one over the
[37:56] other, but brother Adam and Sister Sarah
[38:00] Graham. And we're so delighted also that
[38:04] Sister Sarah's parents are able to be
[38:07] here at this time. if you'd just come,
[38:10] Brother Adam, sister Sarah, our brother
[38:13] and sister Lumsford, hear from Phoenix
[38:16] and how I enjoyed the testimonies.
[38:19] Uh, I would like the church to
[38:22] actually hear maybe at the end of the
[38:24] service if at all possible. Brother
[38:27] Lumsford, if you could just I'd like to
[38:29] have you come forward after I finish the
[38:31] ministry and tell how you saw that man
[38:35] in the wheelchair and that case and just
[38:38] that event if you could. It would be a
[38:40] great blessing and I'd like to have it
[38:42] permanently recorded here so we would be
[38:45] able to bless those that are on the
[38:48] internet and so on. I enjoyed that so
[38:50] much. Amen.
[38:54] Hallelujah.
[39:00] My oh my. And here we have Gideon
[39:04] Michael.
[39:06] Oh,
[39:07] I started studying about Gideon and I
[39:09] almost got so blessed that I I I thought
[39:12] I was going to have to preach on him.
[39:17] Hallelujah.
[39:18] I I saw this boy last night and I
[39:20] thought his name is Gideon, but he's it
[39:22] looks like he's got the locks of salmon
[39:24] Samson on him.
[39:27] Hallelujah.
[39:31] Brother Adam and sister Sarah, I'm sure
[39:35] you pondered what you would call this
[39:37] son. And uh
[39:41] Gideon, mighty warrior. Just I just like
[39:44] that so much.
[39:46] Michael, who is like God or godlike.
[39:51] Adam's parents are here. So this son has
[39:55] grandparents from both sides of the
[39:57] family and he's indeed
[40:00] privileged to have such a heritage.
[40:09] And when Gideon perceived
[40:12] that he was an angel of the Lord, Gideon
[40:15] said, "Alas,
[40:17] oh Lord God, for because I have seen an
[40:20] angel of the Lord
[40:22] face to face." And the Lord said to him,
[40:25] "Peace be unto thee, fear not, thou
[40:29] shalt not die."
[40:31] Then Gideon built an altar there unto
[40:34] the Lord, and called it Jehovah Shalom.
[40:38] That's the only place in the Bible it
[40:40] appears.
[40:43] Gideon perceived
[40:46] that it was not just, and I'm saying
[40:48] this because I'm praying that this son,
[40:52] and there's no reason why we shouldn't
[40:53] pray, will be blessed with that same
[40:56] kind of visitation
[40:58] and that he will be blessed with that
[41:00] same perception to realize, oh, this
[41:03] just isn't a strange experience. This is
[41:05] actually the angel of the Lord that has
[41:08] come to me. And from that perception,
[41:13] and this really moved me, brother Adam,
[41:15] because you told me of two experiences.
[41:18] This boy doesn't know that you as his
[41:20] father experienced two critical times in
[41:24] your life. And you told me of them last
[41:25] night. And I was moved when I began to
[41:30] I added that to what I wanted to say
[41:33] today. and in a critical time when his
[41:37] life could have been extinguished
[41:40] in a car could have been a car wreck.
[41:42] But he said just incredible
[41:45] indescribable peace came
[41:49] and this Gideon gave the world this
[41:53] title for God, Jehovah Shalom, peace.
[41:57] And I'm asking that when this Gideon
[42:01] sees the angel of the Lord
[42:04] that he will and may he have this same
[42:08] encounter.
[42:10] And when he has this encounter, may it
[42:12] be the same thing that it was to that
[42:14] Gideon. Peace. Say Jehovah shalom to my
[42:20] soul, to my life. And I pray that he
[42:24] will give himself to God in such a way.
[42:28] And may this Gideon
[42:33] experience the same God that that Gideon
[42:37] did. There's no reason why those things
[42:38] are written in the scripture for our
[42:40] promises. And I'm sure that you attached
[42:44] if this Gideon was not in the Bible, I
[42:45] doubt if you'd have called him by that
[42:47] name. But that's what inspired you. And
[42:50] so it's I have a right as a servant of
[42:52] Christ to say may the God of that Gideon
[42:55] may be the God of this Gideon. May the
[42:57] perception that he had be the perception
[42:59] that he had. And when he's done and that
[43:01] with that encounter, may he say he is
[43:04] Jehovah Shalom.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to pray God's
[43:08] blessings upon Gideon. The name of our
[43:11] Lord Jesus Christ. How lovely you are,
[43:15] Lord. You've given these such rich
[43:17] gifts, beautiful gems. And how you have
[43:22] had this son called Gideon Michael. You
[43:25] gave him as a gift, Lord, to our sister
[43:28] Sarah and brother Adam. And now as they
[43:31] have standing here before this group of
[43:34] witnesses, this congregation, may you
[43:38] receive this son as they return him to
[43:40] you. And we dedicate him in the name of
[43:42] the Lord Jesus Christ. May he be kept
[43:45] always in good health. May he be strong.
[43:49] And I pray when that encounter comes, he
[43:53] will perceive it is the angel of the
[43:55] Lord. And may this message be a reality
[43:58] to him. And may it be something that he
[44:00] will utter and witness freely from his
[44:02] own mouth. I bless him in the name of
[44:05] the Lord Jesus Christ and his father and
[44:08] mother with leadership to guide him.
[44:11] Lord Jesus, as you bless the children, I
[44:14] bless him now in your name, Jesus. Amen.
[44:19] Amen.
[44:21] Bless you.
[44:22] God bless you, Sister Sarah.
[44:25] God bless you.
[44:29] Amen.
[44:35] We've been blessed by the visit of our
[44:37] brother Edmund Titus. Titus from India
[44:42] and I mentioned that our brother Titus's
[44:45] aunt was in brother Brandham's meetings
[44:48] in Bombay where brother Brandham said
[44:50] there were some of these greatest
[44:51] meetings were actually in India and uh
[44:55] just before I speak uh we only have one
[44:58] service where we've got time for
[45:02] everything. Amen. going to invite you,
[45:05] brother Titus, to come and and uh
[45:08] brother Titus also has a bit of a a
[45:11] PowerPoint going to show some slides and
[45:14] uh then then we'll come to the word and
[45:17] after brother Titus I'd like if brother
[45:19] if Wesley could be just ready to sing
[45:21] the chorus of that song. Didn't he love
[45:24] that song? I'll tell you why I loved it
[45:26] especially. I was coming to church this
[45:29] morning in my car and I was singing out
[45:32] of my heart, holy, holy, holy. I didn't
[45:36] know this song and the old song uh sings
[45:40] holy, holy, I don't care for it because
[45:42] it was written by denominationals.
[45:45] God in three persons, holy trinity. I
[45:47] said, I I reject that.
[45:50] He's one God
[45:52] &gt;&gt; and the angels say holy. Saraphim say
[45:55] holy. Cloverdale Bible Way says
[45:58] &gt;&gt; holy amen.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Listen, be free, friends.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna have a jubilee whether you are
[46:08] or not.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You might as well just start
[46:11] enjoying yourself. We're here for a
[46:13] wonderful time.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come, brother Titus, would you
[46:16] please?
[46:20] They have to leave back, I think,
[46:23] tomorrow or Tuesday. Is it tomorrow?
[46:25] tomorrow. Well, God bless you, brother
[46:27] Titus. Amen.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.
[46:35] Precious heavenly father, our dear Lord
[46:37] Jesus Christ,
[46:39] I thank you for this blessed opportunity
[46:43] to stand here as your witness.
[46:46] And as I stand behind this sacred desk,
[46:50] Lord, I commit myself into thy hands.
[46:53] Lord, unite me with the Holy Ghost and
[46:56] put your words in my mouth so that
[46:59] whatever I speak should glorify your
[47:01] name Lord. In Jesus name. Amen.
[47:07] Uh before I start my testimony, would
[47:10] you mind if I sing a song along with my
[47:13] family?
[47:19] Rachel and his family may join me.
[47:23] Although we are not very good singers or
[47:27] rather I should say we don't know how to
[47:28] sing but we definitely know how to make
[47:31] a joyful night noise unto the Lord.

[51:47] Finally,
[51:54] [Music]
[52:01] God bless you.
[52:12] Amen.
[52:14] God bless you all. Especially
[52:17] God bless you brother Biscll
[52:20] and all the saints here at Bible way.
[52:24] I have written down my testimony and I
[52:28] would like to
[52:30] be precise.
[52:32] So I don't want to deviate from the
[52:36] limited time which has been allotted to
[52:37] me and that is why
[52:41] please bear with me if I read from this.
[52:45] So I bring you greetings from the bride
[52:47] of Christ at Nagpur which is in India.
[52:52] We have almost stayed here for about two
[52:56] months and we found that there's a
[53:00] beautiful bride of Christ
[53:03] in beautiful British Columbia.
[53:06] Whenever we used to read behind the cars
[53:09] on the number plate, beautiful British
[53:11] Columbia, we almost every time said this
[53:15] is a there is a beautiful bride of
[53:16] Christ at British Columbia in and u this
[53:21] church glor Bible way.
[53:25] It was a very nice time to be with you
[53:27] all.
[53:30] I especially want to thank brother
[53:32] Biscll this morning for giving me time
[53:35] to speak a few words today
[53:39] of
[53:41] the small work which is being done by me
[53:44] in India about little bit about my
[53:46] family and also about the miraculous
[53:50] healing of my aunt.
[53:52] So I hope this will the short testimony
[53:56] will bless you all.
[53:59] I also want to thank the saints here for
[54:03] the translation and printing of message
[54:05] books
[54:08] especially for the Hindi translation
[54:12] through which the Hindi- speakaking
[54:14] churches in India are greatly blessed.
[54:18] As you all might be aware, Hindi is the
[54:20] national language of India and
[54:25] uh most everybody understands Hindi. So
[54:32] we are greatly blessed by your effort
[54:34] brother and all the efforts of this
[54:37] church.
[54:41] uh as I told you earlier many of you
[54:43] earlier we are regularly streaming the
[54:45] services and I'm sure my family back in
[54:49] India is streaming this service live
[54:52] today
[54:53] so I greet them also in Jesus name
[54:57] and the services have been of great
[55:00] spiritual blessings to all of us
[55:03] in making ourselves ready for the
[55:05] rapture
[55:07] we are tremendally tremendously blessed
[55:09] by the ministry of brother Ed Bisll,
[55:14] brother Tomrey and all the ministers of
[55:16] CL Bible Way.
[55:21] I believe believers across the world
[55:25] would join me in praising the Lord for
[55:28] providing these internet services.
[55:32] This has been a great source of blessing
[55:33] to us.
[55:37] So thank you once again and God bless
[55:39] you saints for caring for the bride of
[55:41] Christ
[55:43] around the world and extending the
[55:47] services to us.
[55:50] Now a short testimony about my family.
[55:55] As you all know
[55:58] predestination is a very vital
[56:02] truth of the Bible. We all have been
[56:05] predestinated
[56:06] before the foundation of the world to be
[56:09] conformed to the image of Lord Jesus
[56:13] Christ.
[56:14] So when I think of predestination,
[56:18] I would like to share with you that my
[56:21] grandfather
[56:24] who was a Hindu and a son of a Hindu
[56:28] religious priest
[56:30] was the only survivor of the plague that
[56:34] struck India during 1890s.
[56:38] Of all the children which my
[56:41] greatgrandfather had, my grandfather was
[56:44] only survivor and he was a Hindu.
[56:47] But
[56:49] he was only 12 years old at that time.
[56:52] But the Christian missionaries who were
[56:54] there present in India at that time,
[56:58] they took care of my father. They kept
[56:59] him in their home and they brought him
[57:02] up. And at the
[57:05] age of 19, he accepted the Lord Jesus
[57:09] Christ as his personal savior and was
[57:10] baptized
[57:12] and the missionaries named him Titus. So
[57:16] that is how our surname started from
[57:18] there.
[57:22] From the beginning it was in his blood
[57:26] to preach because he belonged to a
[57:28] priestly family. It was earlier a Hindu
[57:32] priestly family when he accepted the
[57:34] Lord Jesus Christ. He still had in his
[57:36] blood to preach the word of God. So he
[57:39] used to go out in his own way and preach
[57:43] into the remote jungles and villages.
[57:47] One
[57:48] evening it was twilight time and he was
[57:51] returning back from preaching in a
[57:53] remote jungle after the evening service
[57:57] and he was coming uh there are no roads
[58:00] in the villages in jungles. It is a
[58:04] rough patch
[58:06] from where people find their way. So he
[58:08] was coming from there and suddenly a
[58:11] tiger huge tiger crossed his way and he
[58:14] stood
[58:16] and the tiger looked at him and my
[58:18] grandfather just prayed a simple prayer
[58:20] because he was at that time in the
[58:23] Lutheran faith.
[58:26] He just prayed to God and God saved his
[58:28] life. The tiger simply looked at him and
[58:30] went away.
[58:33] That was predestination.
[58:37] Then
[58:40] so the Lord preserved him so that he and
[58:42] his
[58:43] son and his generations
[58:47] should accept this message
[58:50] and be a part of the bride of Jesus
[58:52] Christ.
[58:54] Now my my grandfather was also present
[58:56] in brother Branham's meetings when
[58:59] brother Branham visited Bombay in India
[59:02] in September 1954 with his two daughters
[59:06] and his youngest daughter my aunt was
[59:10] critically ill. She was with us in our
[59:13] home at Nagpur
[59:15] being the youngest sister of my father.
[59:18] My father brought her up in his own home
[59:21] as his own daughter and uh she was
[59:25] critically ill and all the doctors of
[59:27] Nagpur could not diagnose what the
[59:29] disease was. At that time medical
[59:31] facilities and diagnostic centers were
[59:34] also not so advanced.
[59:37] So
[59:39] when they heard that brother Branam is
[59:40] visiting Bombay
[59:43] and he is endowed with
[59:46] a commission from the angel of the Lord
[59:49] that nothing can stand before his prayer
[59:51] and great miracles are happening
[59:53] throughout the world. So they my
[59:55] grandfather and my grandmother and my
[59:58] two aunts were there in the meetings
[1:00:03] and when my
[1:00:06] on the very first day of brother Brian's
[1:00:08] convention uh campaign she got prayer
[1:00:10] card number one
[1:00:13] predestination she got prayer card
[1:00:16] number one and as a young girl of about
[1:00:21] 25 26 years at that time she was very
[1:00:25] nervous before the lacks of people
[1:00:27] hundreds of thousands of people she went
[1:00:30] on the stage. She she still describes
[1:00:32] that to me. So and brother Brandham as
[1:00:37] he saw her he discerned what is her
[1:00:41] name? She he said you are escatitis.
[1:00:46] You are not from here. You are from uh
[1:00:48] central India from a place called Nagpur
[1:00:51] and you are suffering from this disease
[1:00:53] and doctors have given up you to die.
[1:00:56] And then he said I perceive that you are
[1:01:00] a child of God
[1:01:02] and there is no G in your heart.
[1:01:05] and he prayed for her and he said in the
[1:01:08] name of Jesus Christ I
[1:01:11] you are healed
[1:01:13] and from that day from that very moment
[1:01:17] my aunt received her healing I'll be
[1:01:19] showing you your picture she received
[1:01:21] the healing and from that day she has
[1:01:24] never taken any medicine and till today
[1:01:27] she's alive
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; she's Amen
[1:01:32] to go
[1:01:33] hallelujah
[1:01:38] She is 79 years old.
[1:01:41] And just before I was coming to Canada,
[1:01:45] just three days before she telephoned me
[1:01:48] and told me, she calls me Ed because my
[1:01:51] name is Edmund. So she's she said Ed, I
[1:01:55] want to be baptized in the name of Lord
[1:01:57] Jesus Christ. Now my father died till
[1:02:01] the day of his death. He was telling her
[1:02:03] this is the truth. You have to accept it
[1:02:05] if you want to go in the rapture. This
[1:02:07] is the true message. But she did not
[1:02:10] accept it. But just three days before I
[1:02:12] came to Canada, she telephoned me all of
[1:02:15] a sudden and I was surprised and I told
[1:02:17] her after I come back from Canada, I'll
[1:02:20] baptize you definitely.
[1:02:22] So you can see the predestion after 54
[1:02:26] years
[1:02:28] she tells now I want to be baptized.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Of course she was also present when the
[1:02:37] miracle of the healing of the blind man
[1:02:41] was performed by brother Ranham.
[1:02:43] Immediately after my aunt's healing,
[1:02:46] uh they were there and they saw with
[1:02:49] their own eyes how that blind man
[1:02:51] received his sight.
[1:02:54] Of course, in 1954, I was a small boy of
[1:02:57] 8 years only.
[1:03:00] Anyway, then after brother Brandham left
[1:03:02] India, as you all may be aware, there
[1:03:04] was no follow-up work.
[1:03:08] We did not know of his word ministry.
[1:03:10] Our family had the visitation of God
[1:03:13] through his prophet Elijah. We knew that
[1:03:16] brother Brandham is the prophet of God
[1:03:18] and he has got great healing ministry.
[1:03:22] Up to that we knew but we did not know
[1:03:25] about his word ministry until after 1963
[1:03:29] when my father started receiving message
[1:03:32] books and that too one or two message
[1:03:36] books in a month.
[1:03:40] My father was then pastoring a
[1:03:41] Pentecostal church and had approximately
[1:03:44] 250 members.
[1:03:47] As the Holy Spirit began to convince him
[1:03:50] about the truth, he shared the same with
[1:03:52] his family. We used to sit in the night
[1:03:55] have a prayer and all and he used to
[1:03:58] share out of the message which he had
[1:04:01] read during the day.
[1:04:03] And the Holy Spirit began to work in our
[1:04:06] family.
[1:04:08] And on 2nd March 1969,
[1:04:11] my grandfather, my father, his two
[1:04:14] sisters, me and one of my sisters, we
[1:04:19] all got baptized in the name of Lord
[1:04:21] Jesus Christ and we accepted the message
[1:04:24] of the hour.
[1:04:27] Now here I would like to show you a few
[1:04:29] pictures on PowerPoint
[1:04:32] of the small congregation which we have
[1:04:34] in Nagpur.
[1:04:36] The work is developing now. I was in
[1:04:40] government service so I could not fully
[1:04:42] devote my time to the ministry. I was uh
[1:04:46] officer with the Indian revenue service
[1:04:49] and I retired only in October. So after
[1:04:52] that I am fully uh devoting my time, my
[1:04:56] heart, my soul to this work. So I'd like
[1:04:58] to show you some pictures.
[1:05:01] As you see,
[1:05:04] it is the greeting from the bride of
[1:05:05] Lord Jesus Christ at Nagpur, India.
[1:05:08] Shalom.
[1:05:16] Many many believers ask me where is
[1:05:19] Nagpur?
[1:05:21] So I just had this map.
[1:05:25] Nangur is down south of Russia and west
[1:05:29] of China
[1:05:30] in India in center of India. We'll come
[1:05:34] to that.
[1:05:36] Now the population of India is
[1:05:37] approximately 1.3 billion.
[1:05:40] The Christian population is about 24
[1:05:43] million which accounts for about 2.34%
[1:05:47] of the country's total population.
[1:05:50] 1.5% of the Christian population are
[1:05:53] Catholics and the remaining are
[1:05:55] Protestants.
[1:06:02] Nagpur has a population of nearly 3
[1:06:04] million
[1:06:07] and Christian population of the city is
[1:06:09] approximately three lakhs of which
[1:06:12] nearly 50% are Catholics.
[1:06:19] Nagpur as I said is in the center of
[1:06:21] India. So we have the zero milestone
[1:06:24] also which is depicted here in the
[1:06:28] picture
[1:06:30] and inscription that uh poll is there
[1:06:34] which shows you this is the center of
[1:06:36] India.
[1:06:39] Then we have sprawling shopping malls in
[1:06:42] Nagpur. It is not a very backward place.
[1:06:45] In India there is a wide disparity. on
[1:06:47] one hand you have dire poverty on the
[1:06:49] other hand you have uh great affluence.
[1:06:53] So this is one such market in Nagpur.
[1:06:56] Nagpur is a very big city
[1:06:58] and uh a lot of business centers are
[1:07:02] there.
[1:07:05] This business center is just behind my
[1:07:07] house or rather my house is behind this
[1:07:10] business center.
[1:07:17] Now this is the small lake where we were
[1:07:24] baptizing the people
[1:07:27] and uh my father also used to baptize
[1:07:31] there only
[1:07:33] and there was one brother um from
[1:07:35] Tanzania brother Zephaniah Peters during
[1:07:39] the minister's conference he showed us
[1:07:42] one clipping where he was to baptize a
[1:07:45] person and they were going with a
[1:07:48] measuring rod and going and seeing how
[1:07:52] deep is the water. The water was all
[1:07:54] muddy. I don't know whether brother
[1:07:56] Peters is there or not. Anyway, so
[1:07:58] brother Biskel remember that. So we use
[1:08:02] had to do the same thing in this lake
[1:08:04] and measure because suddenly it used to
[1:08:06] be very deep. So instead of drawing
[1:08:10] along with the baptismal candidate,
[1:08:14] we thought it is better to measure the
[1:08:16] depth first and then to enter. So my
[1:08:18] elder used to go and do that for me and
[1:08:20] we used to baptize people
[1:08:24] of course. Now this is the baptism of
[1:08:27] brother Deepak,
[1:08:32] October 18th, 1988.
[1:08:36] And along with brother Deepak, my two
[1:08:38] daughters were also baptized in this
[1:08:40] same place on the same day.
[1:08:46] Now this place is beautified by the
[1:08:48] government and it has become so crowded
[1:08:52] on any day that it is not possible to
[1:08:55] conduct any religious service or baptize
[1:08:58] people because that will create a havoc
[1:09:00] there. They're all anti-Christian people
[1:09:04] and uh it'll be difficult. So we have
[1:09:07] constructed a small tank in the backyard
[1:09:12] of my house which I'll show you
[1:09:15] when we come to the baptisms. So this is
[1:09:17] my house.
[1:09:20] We were first meeting here.
[1:09:26] Is it to do
[1:09:30] Okay, it's all right.
[1:09:35] We were meeting on the ground floor and
[1:09:37] if you can see the um
[1:09:41] front ver people were sitting there also
[1:09:45] when we used to have worship there and
[1:09:46] even under the patio we used to put the
[1:09:49] chairs and people used to sit there and
[1:09:51] we used to have the Sunday worship
[1:09:54] service and even witness evening. But
[1:09:57] then
[1:09:59] it was difficult. They could pull on in
[1:10:03] summer.
[1:10:05] But in now the rainy season started and
[1:10:08] we have rainy season for four months in
[1:10:10] India and it rains very heavily.
[1:10:13] Downpour is so heavy. It rains like cats
[1:10:16] and dogs. So we not we did not expect
[1:10:18] our believers to sit with open
[1:10:21] umbrellas. Each one having his umbrella
[1:10:23] and then worshiping the Lord. So we
[1:10:26] constructed this first floor on top of
[1:10:28] my house which you can see and it is
[1:10:32] partly completed and we are going to
[1:10:34] complete it after we go back.
[1:10:40] Now this is the uh
[1:10:43] the
[1:10:45] hall where we are worshiing on the first
[1:10:47] floor. You can see the worship service
[1:10:51] in
[1:10:53] progress.
[1:10:59] You can see the sisters
[1:11:02] who are singing, raising their hand and
[1:11:04] praising and worshiping God.
[1:11:08] The men folks beating drums and
[1:11:14] other instruments.
[1:11:17] You can see myself also in the picture.
[1:11:20] Some are on the out verenda also on the
[1:11:23] first floor.
[1:11:26] Again the worship service is going on.
[1:11:32] Again the another section where you can
[1:11:34] even see sister Rachel raising her hand.
[1:11:40] Yeah. This is another view where some
[1:11:42] ladies are sitting on the ground. Even
[1:11:44] my daughter is sitting there.
[1:11:51] So
[1:11:54] these are some of the views of the
[1:11:56] church service which were lying on the
[1:11:58] first floor of our house. Now this is
[1:12:01] these are some photographs of the
[1:12:02] baptismal service. As I told you we have
[1:12:05] constructed a small tank in the
[1:12:07] courtyard in the backyard of our house
[1:12:11] and we are having baptisms.
[1:12:13] Not in this photograph. In this photo,
[1:12:19] this young believer,
[1:12:23] he was
[1:12:25] already a pastor in Anglican church
[1:12:30] and he had about 40 converts whom he had
[1:12:34] baptized in the name of father, son and
[1:12:37] holy ghost. when he accepted this
[1:12:39] message,
[1:12:41] he has a burden to share the truth with
[1:12:44] them. So I baptized
[1:12:47] about eight people
[1:12:49] just before coming here on 27th May
[1:12:55] and presently I hear I get emails from
[1:12:59] my people and they say that about five
[1:13:03] six are still waiting including my
[1:13:05] grandson Joshua.
[1:13:07] Now here is the picture
[1:13:10] which I want to show. This is the
[1:13:12] picture of my eldest daughter's wedding.
[1:13:17] You can see on extreme right myself
[1:13:20] standing there. I may be looking very
[1:13:22] young to you
[1:13:26] but that was 10 years ago in 1997 this
[1:13:29] picture is taken.
[1:13:31] So on the extreme right I am standing
[1:13:33] and on my right side is brother Deepak.
[1:13:37] He's also looking very young with
[1:13:38] respects.
[1:13:40] Then in front of brother Deepak in red
[1:13:43] sari is my wife sister Rachel.
[1:13:46] Behind and by the side of Deepak is my
[1:13:49] second daughter Kiran and
[1:13:52] by the side of my wife is my eldest
[1:13:54] daughter Joti and my son-in-law
[1:13:59] Nitan.
[1:14:00] who is looking after the church when I'm
[1:14:02] away here. He's he's taking care of the
[1:14:05] church at NPU.
[1:14:07] And the lady which you see in the white
[1:14:11] sweater
[1:14:14] in front of me and brother Deepak,
[1:14:16] there's a lady standing by the side of
[1:14:18] my wife
[1:14:21] with white sweater on. She is my aunt
[1:14:24] who was healed through the ministry of
[1:14:27] the granam.
[1:14:31] Now
[1:14:37] I'll take a few more minutes and then
[1:14:39] conclude
[1:14:43] about the India campaign.
[1:14:47] You are all aware.
[1:14:49] Brother Brandham speaks about his visit
[1:14:51] to Bombay, India. In quite a few of his
[1:14:55] messages,
[1:14:56] he tells about the blind sun worshipper
[1:14:59] man receiving his sight and the
[1:15:01] magnitude of his healing ministry.
[1:15:04] He also expresses how the churches in
[1:15:06] India should have taken care of the new
[1:15:08] converts who got converted from various
[1:15:11] religions with his v visit to India. So
[1:15:14] I'll just want to show you a clipping if
[1:15:18] you can just allow me to play it.
[1:15:46] Is it
[1:15:55] what is wrong?
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:05] Church
[1:16:20] about
[1:16:30] the city with doubt and that's when the
[1:16:32] blind man received his sight stand there
[1:16:34] when I challenged every Muhammad and
[1:16:36] everyone come give me his sight and I'll
[1:16:38] believe you let that god he is the
[1:16:41] worship of the sun out of his eyes is
[1:16:43] out he worshiped the creation to the
[1:16:44] creator I said I was down at the temple
[1:16:46] of James you know and and Buddhas and
[1:16:49] all of them there seven or eight
[1:16:51] different religions and every one of
[1:16:52] them against Jesus Christ and didn't
[1:16:54] believe in him so that night when that
[1:16:56] great challenge come there was all of
[1:16:57] them sitting out said now here's a man
[1:17:00] been blind for 20 years. You think I'm
[1:17:01] reading his mind? You know, a holy man,
[1:17:04] you know, and so forth, the worshippers.
[1:17:06] I said, "You think it's a telepathy?"
[1:17:08] That's reading his mind, telling him
[1:17:09] what his name. Couldn't he pronounce it?
[1:17:11] Had to spell it out. See? And so I said,
[1:17:13] "Uh, that was right." And he was a man
[1:17:16] had two children, his wife, and one boy
[1:17:18] eight, the other 10 or something like
[1:17:20] that. I said, "Now you thought that
[1:17:21] mental telepathy." Now, if that's mental
[1:17:24] telepathy, then you come here. I don't
[1:17:26] know nothing about telepathy. If it is,
[1:17:28] you're a genius at it. I don't know
[1:17:30] about psychology. You come here and give
[1:17:32] me sight and I'll follow you. I said,
[1:17:35] the Mohamad religion is so great. This
[1:17:37] Quran is right. I said, then let the
[1:17:39] Muhammad priest come here and give him
[1:17:41] the sight and I'll be a Muhammad.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; I said, now I challenge you, everyone in
[1:17:46] the name of Jesus Christ to come give
[1:17:47] him his sight. I'd have never said that
[1:17:49] if I hadn't seen a vision to go to
[1:17:51] receive his sign, but I know where it
[1:17:52] was at.
[1:17:57] That's the quietest bunch you ever
[1:17:58] heard. Thousands. Why take me two hours
[1:18:01] to press through an automobile to get up
[1:18:02] there? And so the man standing there and
[1:18:04] I said, he said he'd serve the God to
[1:18:06] give you his sight. I said, "That's a
[1:18:08] great big challenge to the Muhammad
[1:18:09] religion, Buddha, James or whatever it
[1:18:12] might be. There it is." So nobody I
[1:18:16] said, "What you so quiet about?" I said,
[1:18:18] "You know, the reason they don't come is
[1:18:20] because they can't do it. And neither
[1:18:22] can I. But the God of heaven has raised
[1:18:24] up his son Jesus Christ whose witness I
[1:18:26] am.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; I said I saw a vision that he's going to
[1:18:29] get his sight. Now I said if he doesn't
[1:18:31] get his sight I'm a false prophet run me
[1:18:33] out of India. But if he does get his
[1:18:35] sight now how many of you will receive
[1:18:37] Christ as personal savior and forget
[1:18:38] about your Muhammad and prophet and so
[1:18:40] forth just as far as you've seen masses
[1:18:42] of hands thousands times.
[1:18:45] That's it.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; I motioned to him. I told him in
[1:18:48] translator I said don't interpret this.
[1:18:50] I said, "Heavenly Father, it's again
[1:18:53] Mount Carmel." I said, "You will not let
[1:18:55] your word be defeated because you showed
[1:18:57] me the man that was going to receive his
[1:18:59] sight." I said, "Let the God who showed
[1:19:01] me the vision of his eyes being open.
[1:19:04] Let him open the eyes." He let out a
[1:19:05] scream. The mayor could see as good as I
[1:19:07] can. Anyone else? He run to the mayor of
[1:19:09] the city. I had to leave the platform. I
[1:19:11] didn't have no shoes. when I got out
[1:19:13] there and pockets all from my clothes
[1:19:14] and they had great big strings of people
[1:19:17] I guess the guards or something had them
[1:19:19] long sticks you know holding them off
[1:19:21] like that and people run over their feet
[1:19:23] under the leg just to touch it crawl on
[1:19:26] top of their back I had to leave the
[1:19:28] city that he we couldn't get out of the
[1:19:30] city kind of having protection and that
[1:19:32] man had testified before the governor or
[1:19:34] the what president I think it is up
[1:19:37] there and the mayor of the city was
[1:19:38] witness of it I had his name I got it
[1:19:40] one of my pockets now I think down
[1:19:42] motel, one of the pockets of my co
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; and so were my
[1:19:48] family a witness to this great event,
[1:19:51] great miracle.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; I went to Bombay. I count that my
[1:19:55] greatest meeting because of the effect
[1:19:57] it had on the people. And I if in Africa
[1:20:01] they say 30,000 came to Christ at one
[1:20:04] time, then there was 150 or 200,000 came
[1:20:08] to Christ at one time out of that half a
[1:20:10] million.
[1:20:12] What could I do? There was a thing
[1:20:15] perhaps say there was just say there's
[1:20:17] 100,000 of them. There was no church,
[1:20:20] nothing I could do. There's nobody to
[1:20:22] give to them. The message I believe
[1:20:25] there was even a Pentecostal
[1:20:26] denomination would cooperate with me.
[1:20:29] And all those souls probably back in Jan
[1:20:32] Buddhism, whatever they come from. No
[1:20:35] place to put them.
[1:20:40] No, that was a shame. Prophet said
[1:20:42] that's a shame. That's a dis disgrace.
[1:20:44] See, because I had no cooperation
[1:20:47] because of the stand that I take. So
[1:20:49] that is why
[1:20:52] lot of work which could have been done
[1:20:54] in India was not done and the message
[1:20:59] came very late in India.
[1:21:04] So we are so thankful to God
[1:21:07] that the message of the hour is
[1:21:09] continuing to reach those who are
[1:21:11] predestinated to his bride before the
[1:21:14] foundation of the world.
[1:21:18] So now
[1:21:22] the prophet demonstrated before the
[1:21:24] whole world that Jesus Christ is the
[1:21:26] same yesterday, today and forever.
[1:21:29] And his message still is true.
[1:21:32] Whenever we play the tape in our
[1:21:34] meetings, great miracles are happening.
[1:21:37] Just some
[1:21:40] time back a boy
[1:21:42] uh his mother was a Buddhist and his
[1:21:46] both the legs were crooked so much so
[1:21:48] that the sole of his feet were looking
[1:21:50] skyward like this and he was he was
[1:21:54] walking like this.
[1:21:57] And that uh poor old woman
[1:22:02] illiterate. She asked me what can be
[1:22:05] done. I said we will have faith for her
[1:22:07] and we'll pray for her. We prayed for
[1:22:09] her son and I told her you play the
[1:22:13] message of brother Brandham in your
[1:22:14] house. I gave her some cassettes and she
[1:22:18] started playing the house and within two
[1:22:20] to three months time both of his legs
[1:22:22] became normal
[1:22:25] and now he he's a boy of about 18 20
[1:22:29] years old and he is playing football
[1:22:32] soccer he's uh driving his motorcycle
[1:22:36] absolutely normal he's wearing shoes
[1:22:40] similarly many of people who had demon
[1:22:43] possession
[1:22:45] They were delivered instantly. Recently
[1:22:48] a Roman Catholic man, he he was also
[1:22:50] baptized on 27th May along with the
[1:22:52] eight persons. He had demon possession.
[1:22:55] So my elder went to his house, he was
[1:22:58] called. They prayed and then they played
[1:23:01] the message of brother Brandham
[1:23:05] be certain of God. And as the tape was
[1:23:08] being played within 10 minutes all the
[1:23:11] demons left him. He came back to his
[1:23:13] senses and he accepted Jesus Christ as
[1:23:15] his personal savior and he was baptized
[1:23:18] in Jesus name.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; So not only
[1:23:22] the message is still alive, it is the
[1:23:25] voice of God for this age. I also
[1:23:27] experienced it in my own healing when I
[1:23:29] was healed he healed of the heart
[1:23:31] trouble completely.
[1:23:33] So, not only is the message still
[1:23:36] healing the people, the message of God's
[1:23:39] prophet was sent to call out the bride
[1:23:42] of Lord Jesus Christ out of the logician
[1:23:44] church age and to prepare her for the
[1:23:47] rapture.
[1:23:49] So, the message is changing the lives of
[1:23:51] the believers who are listening to the
[1:23:53] message. This we are experiencing and
[1:23:56] you all are also experiencing to that in
[1:23:59] India in a remote place in Nagpur you
[1:24:02] find people whose lives are changed. We
[1:24:04] don't have to tell them uh you uh wear
[1:24:07] such type of dress where have
[1:24:10] ladies don't have short hair. The
[1:24:12] message is telling them they are
[1:24:14] illiterate people. But the Hindi message
[1:24:16] books which have reached their hands
[1:24:19] they are reading and they are
[1:24:22] understanding and they are accepting the
[1:24:23] message and it is changing their lives.
[1:24:26] So we find the bride of Christ being
[1:24:28] prepared all over the world for rapture
[1:24:30] and we at Nagpur are also looking
[1:24:34] forward waiting eagerly for the rapture.
[1:24:37] May our hearts be always tuned to hear
[1:24:39] the call come up hither. Amen. So may
[1:24:43] our Lord Jesus Christ continue to bless
[1:24:45] and prosper our precious brother Biscll,
[1:24:48] brother Tomrey and all the ministers and
[1:24:53] saints of CL Bible way. Amen. God bless
[1:24:56] you all richly
[1:25:07] and take our greetings back to the
[1:25:08] saints in India. Amen. To the church.
[1:25:12] Well, it's it's just nice to be able to
[1:25:16] uh share something with people who are
[1:25:17] on the other side of the world. Amen.
[1:25:20] going to have you stand with me now and
[1:25:22] uh
[1:25:25] let's just sing we worship thee in
[1:25:26] spirit and in truth shall we? And then
[1:25:29] I'll have you turn also to while we're
[1:25:32] singing you can turn to John's gospel
[1:25:34] the 20th chapter John
[1:25:36] we worship you
[1:25:42] in spirit
[1:25:44] and in truth.
[1:25:50] We
[1:25:52] worship you in spirit.
[1:25:58] [Music]
[1:26:14] We worship you
[1:26:18] in spirit
[1:26:20] and in truth
[1:26:24] together. We'll just offer this prayer.
[1:26:27] Father,
[1:26:30] where two or three are gathered in your
[1:26:33] name, there you are in the midst. And
[1:26:36] we're many more than that just now. But
[1:26:39] we have come to say we're dependent upon
[1:26:41] you. We have come to say that we thank
[1:26:45] you for what we have heard and for the
[1:26:49] great things you have done, but even
[1:26:52] more so the great things that you are
[1:26:54] doing now. Lord, you have surely been
[1:26:57] raised up from history and you have
[1:27:00] proven yourself, Lord, to us that you
[1:27:03] are the same yesterday, today, and
[1:27:06] forever. Somebody needs you today, Lord.
[1:27:09] And I pray that what they've heard will
[1:27:11] encourage and inspire their faith. And
[1:27:14] now I ask oh God that the Holy Spirit,
[1:27:18] the divine Holy Ghost with the spirit of
[1:27:21] revelation will be upon each one of us
[1:27:24] and enlarge oh God the boundaries of our
[1:27:26] thought and our understanding in eternal
[1:27:30] things in the name of Jesus Christ I ask
[1:27:32] it. Anoint us all for service now. Amen.
[1:27:37] Amen.
[1:27:39] God bless you. I ask for your undivided
[1:27:42] attention. Are you ready?
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; All right. I want to start to read at uh
[1:27:48] in the 20th chapter at the 11th verse.
[1:27:54] But Mary stood without at the sele.
[1:27:59] As she wept, she stooped down, and
[1:28:01] looked into the seeler, and seeth two
[1:28:04] angels in white sitting, and one at the
[1:28:07] head, and the other at the feet, where
[1:28:10] the body of Jesus had lain. And they say
[1:28:13] unto her,"Woman, why weepest thou?" And
[1:28:16] she saith unto them, Because they have
[1:28:19] taken away my Lord, and I know not where
[1:28:22] they have laid him. And when she had
[1:28:25] thus said, she turned herself back, and
[1:28:27] saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it
[1:28:30] was Jesus. Jesus said unto her,"Woman,
[1:28:34] why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou?"
[1:28:37] She supposing him to be the gardener,
[1:28:39] sith unto him, Sir, if you have borne
[1:28:42] him hence tell me where thou hast laid
[1:28:45] him, and I will take him away." Jesus
[1:28:48] saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself
[1:28:52] and said unto him, "Reboni," which is to
[1:28:55] say, "Master." Jesus saith unto her,
[1:28:59] "Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended
[1:29:02] to my father." But go to my brethren,
[1:29:05] and say unto them, I ascend unto my
[1:29:08] father, and to your father, and to my
[1:29:11] God, and to your God. May God bless his
[1:29:14] word. As you have your seats,
[1:29:19] I want to draw your attention very
[1:29:21] quickly. And if you stay with me,
[1:29:24] because this has been a important
[1:29:27] time for me,
[1:29:29] I'm I'm going all the way back from the
[1:29:32] from the convention which we've had. I
[1:29:34] I'm still under the effects of what God
[1:29:38] was and is doing.
[1:29:40] Uh, I want to speak on these words,
[1:29:44] winds of change.
[1:29:47] And I'd like to draw your attention to
[1:29:49] this one single and very important fact.
[1:29:53] And I'll show it to you in the
[1:29:55] scriptures and in normal life, our our
[1:29:58] everyday life is we are not always
[1:30:02] conscious
[1:30:04] of these change changing winds of
[1:30:08] change. When changes are taking place,
[1:30:11] we're not always conscious of it until
[1:30:14] after the fact. And then we look back
[1:30:18] and we see the change that has taken
[1:30:21] place. Now even in natural life, we're
[1:30:24] very very aware of what is called
[1:30:27] adolescence,
[1:30:28] what is children or childhood. But there
[1:30:32] is that era, that time in everyone's
[1:30:35] life. they change from adolescence
[1:30:38] into adulthood.
[1:30:41] And uh uh many many cultures also in
[1:30:44] India and the Hindu culture and in uh uh
[1:30:48] in in the Jewish culture they have the
[1:30:51] bar mitzvah when a child is uh believed
[1:30:54] to have come into adulthood and they
[1:30:57] have all these various types of
[1:30:59] ceremonies. In the Christian world, they
[1:31:02] have, you know, a confirmation, the
[1:31:04] rights of confirmation and a a time when
[1:31:07] they regard that the child has now come
[1:31:10] into adulthood and should be responsible
[1:31:13] as adults. But you know within the even
[1:31:16] within the chemistry of our bodies we're
[1:31:20] not aware that we're just we're changing
[1:31:24] and and then as as time goes on then it
[1:31:28] you know it it we're uh uh sometimes
[1:31:32] even you know kind of surprised well
[1:31:35] such a change is taking place within our
[1:31:38] own bodies and with our own emotional
[1:31:41] self. changes are we become aware of it
[1:31:45] and we're not aware of it while it's
[1:31:47] taking place but we become aware of it
[1:31:49] just following or as soon afterward
[1:31:53] and I'm going to give you uh a number of
[1:31:56] things
[1:31:58] uh uh just quickly before we I break
[1:32:00] into that that particular subject I want
[1:32:03] to give you a number of scriptures and
[1:32:05] some and some quotes as well
[1:32:10] spiritually speaking
[1:32:12] It is absolutely essential
[1:32:16] that we are in tune with God
[1:32:20] and that we have made known to us by the
[1:32:24] Holy Spirit what not what he has done
[1:32:28] but what he's doing now. I believe
[1:32:30] that's very important. Now the scripture
[1:32:33] says this.
[1:32:35] These things, this is John 12:16. Don't
[1:32:38] turn to it. I'm just going to read it.
[1:32:40] These things understood not the
[1:32:41] disciples at the first. I'll just start
[1:32:45] again.
[1:32:47] These things understood not the
[1:32:49] disciples
[1:32:51] at the first. But when Jesus was
[1:32:54] glorified,
[1:32:56] then remembered they that these things
[1:32:59] were written of him, and that they had
[1:33:02] done these things unto him. Afterward,
[1:33:06] they became aware of it. Peter when he
[1:33:09] was rehearsing to the apostles in
[1:33:11] Jerusalem what had happened at
[1:33:13] Cornelius's house and how he had had the
[1:33:17] vision and how Cornelius had sent men to
[1:33:20] him and he's rehearsing this and and as
[1:33:24] he's speaking he's saying this and as I
[1:33:27] began to speak the Holy Ghost fell on
[1:33:31] them as on us at the beginning then
[1:33:35] remembered I the word of the Lord. Lord,
[1:33:38] how he had said, John indeed baptized
[1:33:41] with water, but you shall be baptized
[1:33:44] with the Holy Ghost. So, we have in the
[1:33:47] scripture where John the John the
[1:33:48] Baptist says those words, but they heard
[1:33:51] the Lord Jesus say those words and those
[1:33:54] words came back into Peter's remembrance
[1:33:57] after he has now preached. And so now
[1:34:01] he's been, please understand, he's been
[1:34:04] working his way through the whole event.
[1:34:07] He's had the vision. He's seen the sheet
[1:34:10] coming down saying, "Peter, eat. I've
[1:34:12] never eaten of anything unclean. Take
[1:34:15] and eat." And God is showing him that
[1:34:17] now he must go to the Gentiles. Men are
[1:34:20] at the door knocking. He he he follows
[1:34:23] them. And there were six alto together
[1:34:25] that went with him. He goes to
[1:34:27] Cornelius's house. While he's preaching,
[1:34:30] the Holy Ghost falls on them. And when
[1:34:32] all this now he's gone through the whole
[1:34:35] event, then I remembered the word of the
[1:34:38] Lord that he shall baptize you. John
[1:34:42] indeed baptized with water, but you
[1:34:44] shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:47] Jesus in speaking to Nicodemus,
[1:34:50] he said, "The wind bloweth where it
[1:34:53] listeth." Don't just get caught up in
[1:34:56] the fact that you know these verses
[1:34:58] almost by memory, but think what he's
[1:35:00] saying. And the wind bloweth where it
[1:35:02] listeth, and thou you hear the sound
[1:35:05] thereof, and can but can not tell whence
[1:35:10] it cometh and whether it goeth. So is
[1:35:13] everyone that is born of the spirit.
[1:35:16] Jesus is saying he he's describing the
[1:35:20] most incredulous experience that can
[1:35:23] happen to a human being. They are
[1:35:25] actually born again of the spirit of
[1:35:29] God. And he said you hear the sound. You
[1:35:33] you maybe see some evidence of it but
[1:35:35] really do not understand. We don't know
[1:35:37] where it came from. We don't know where
[1:35:40] it's going. All you see is an event and
[1:35:42] then and then after you see the event,
[1:35:45] you come to a realization. The
[1:35:47] realization something's passed by.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Right while you're standing there or
[1:35:53] here here today in the service, right in
[1:35:55] this service, this very scripture could
[1:35:57] be fulfilled once again. And you sitting
[1:36:00] right beside that individual wouldn't
[1:36:02] know. It would pass straight through.
[1:36:04] that person be born again of the spirit
[1:36:06] of God, receive eternal life, have their
[1:36:09] sins totally forgiven, and you wouldn't
[1:36:12] know a thing about it. It would just
[1:36:13] pass by. And then on down the road, you
[1:36:16] say, "My, she's changed. My, he's
[1:36:19] changed." But you didn't know the wind
[1:36:22] came from a direction and it went
[1:36:24] another direction and you know nothing
[1:36:26] about it. That's our God.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the way he operates
[1:36:32] in the message Mary's belief. Brother
[1:36:34] Brennham is in Angelie Temple in Los
[1:36:37] Angeles. He said this Angel Temple is
[1:36:40] thirsting for an outbreak of the Holy
[1:36:43] Spirit. Not only that, but the whole
[1:36:46] United States, speaking of of the
[1:36:48] Christian realm, is waiting for a
[1:36:51] revival in our time. He was saying this
[1:36:53] in 1959. But we're waiting for something
[1:36:56] to happen. And I believe that God has
[1:37:00] let it happen and we're just so pushing
[1:37:04] it somewhere else until it until it'll
[1:37:07] pass over us and our time of grace will
[1:37:11] be done.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; We're pushing for it. We're waiting for
[1:37:14] it. We're we're expecting it, but the
[1:37:17] people don't realize what it is that
[1:37:19] they're waiting for. He said, "Let's
[1:37:21] believe that this is the night that God
[1:37:23] will do." And I will say to you, let's
[1:37:25] believe that this is the day that God
[1:37:27] will do the exceedingly abundantly above
[1:37:29] all that we could do or think. He will
[1:37:32] do it tonight. Don't take it for another
[1:37:35] answer. He said it's when it's when we
[1:37:38] think that these things it's when we
[1:37:40] think these things, you create an
[1:37:43] atmosphere around you. So if you want to
[1:37:45] put it off on the future, fine. But
[1:37:48] it'll pass by. It'll pass straight
[1:37:50] through and you don't even realize it's
[1:37:52] happened.
[1:37:55] But if you believe, you say, "I'm not
[1:37:57] waiting for a future time. I'm expecting
[1:38:00] what I have need of. I'm expecting what
[1:38:03] someone else has need of. I'm expecting
[1:38:05] it now. I'm going to create an
[1:38:06] atmosphere of faith and believe in this
[1:38:09] God for this word says he is the same
[1:38:12] exactly what he was. He is today and he
[1:38:15] will be tomorrow."
[1:38:17] In sers, we would see Jesus. He said,
[1:38:20] "But remember, before this happens,
[1:38:24] the church has to go." So he's referring
[1:38:26] to some things that are to take place.
[1:38:28] He said, "But the church has to go." So
[1:38:31] we're at the end time.
[1:38:33] We're right in the shadows of his coming
[1:38:35] right now. This is 1957. He said, "I'm
[1:38:39] so thankful to see that he's come down
[1:38:41] to prove his word." U if it's been a
[1:38:45] dozen or more uh or or before a million.
[1:38:48] He said, "I'm so glad he's come and
[1:38:50] prove his word if it's even before a
[1:38:51] dozen or if it's before a million. But
[1:38:54] it'll pass. Listen to this now. But
[1:38:56] it'll pass right through the people and
[1:39:00] millions will never know about it. It's
[1:39:03] always been that way and it always will
[1:39:07] be that way." Then they'll wonder
[1:39:10] sometime, "Well, I didn't uh really I
[1:39:13] didn't know it." He said, "Got eyes but
[1:39:16] can't see.
[1:39:19] in the message desperation which is the
[1:39:22] service right after the token he said
[1:39:24] you can't be desperate till God speaks
[1:39:27] to you oh I pray that he does today
[1:39:31] oh church rise shake yourself pinch your
[1:39:36] conscience wake yourself up in this hour
[1:39:40] we must be desperate or perish there's
[1:39:43] coming forth something from the Lord and
[1:39:46] I know it is thus saith the Lord.
[1:39:50] There's coming forth something and we
[1:39:52] better get desperate. It's between life
[1:39:55] and death. Here's my point. It'll pass
[1:39:58] through us and we won't see it. I really
[1:40:03] am s I'm I'm really in a a state of awe
[1:40:07] at the times that he says it'll pass
[1:40:10] through us. It'll pass through us. Not
[1:40:13] even beside us, but it'll pass through
[1:40:15] us. It is something that's happening in
[1:40:18] a supernatural, in a spiritual realm.
[1:40:21] When I turned from a child to a man, it
[1:40:24] passed through me and I didn't even
[1:40:27] realize it till afterwards someone
[1:40:29] starts saying, "My, you grew so much in
[1:40:32] so such a short period of time. You your
[1:40:35] voice has changed. This has changed.
[1:40:38] That has changed. All I realize is, you
[1:40:41] know, some things were taking place, but
[1:40:42] you don't fully comprehend what's
[1:40:44] happening." and you turn from a a girl
[1:40:47] into a woman. You turn from a boy into a
[1:40:50] man. It passed through you, but you
[1:40:52] weren't realizing it at the time. Even
[1:40:54] though the word is being preached, the
[1:40:57] Holy Spirit passing through you. Amen.
[1:41:00] And spiritual maturity is taking place
[1:41:02] and you don't realize it. You, right?
[1:41:05] You come in burdened. You come in
[1:41:07] clouded with doubts and whatever more
[1:41:09] and it passes through you and you're not
[1:41:12] even aware the washing of the power of
[1:41:14] the blood of Jesus Christ passing
[1:41:17] through you cleansing you. You may not
[1:41:20] even realize it but it passes through
[1:41:22] you something you're carrying. It passes
[1:41:24] through you and you walk out the doors
[1:41:26] and it's gone.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; That's our God
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; and that's the power of his word. That's
[1:41:35] the power of his spirit. We want to be
[1:41:37] in a place where we don't miss it, where
[1:41:39] we realize it. Even though, oh God, make
[1:41:42] me sensitive. So soon as it happens, I'm
[1:41:44] sitting there. I'm aware something's
[1:41:47] taking place. Perhaps I can't define it,
[1:41:49] but something's happening.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; And begin to give him glory. Begin to
[1:41:55] give him thanks. I know that something's
[1:41:58] happening. and I'll thank him anyway
[1:42:00] because I'm in expectation
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; whether I feel it or I don't feel it
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; in door and a door. Now we come to the
[1:42:12] rapture. He said, "What if the what if
[1:42:13] today the rapture came and he took two
[1:42:16] from Tucson and one from Phoenix and
[1:42:20] around the world as a universal rapture
[1:42:22] will be and the thing and the ones that
[1:42:25] rises from the dead will go to meet him
[1:42:28] in the air
[1:42:30] and steal away a mysterious thing and
[1:42:33] then one of these days judgment drops
[1:42:35] upon the earth." And you say, "Well,
[1:42:38] wasn't this supposed to be a rapture
[1:42:40] time? Wasn't it supposed to be rapture
[1:42:42] first? It's already come and you didn't
[1:42:45] know and you knew it not. Think how many
[1:42:48] people will disappear in the world
[1:42:50] today.
[1:42:52] Think about how many people will
[1:42:53] disappear even today while we're sitting
[1:42:54] here in this 24-hour period. How many
[1:42:57] people will disappear? Will we know
[1:43:00] anything about it? Probably not a person
[1:43:02] in this building will have heard about
[1:43:04] it.
[1:43:07] And they won't even hear a word. You'll
[1:43:09] know nothing about it. There'll be 500
[1:43:12] people in the world which will come up
[1:43:13] missing and you won't know nothing about
[1:43:16] it. We're living in a terrific time. 500
[1:43:20] people disappear and we you won't hear
[1:43:22] about it but it will pass through. It
[1:43:25] will have happened in the presence of
[1:43:28] God unrecognized. He says this and this
[1:43:30] is 1964 now. And think people will go
[1:43:34] right on preaching. Now we're after the
[1:43:36] we're after the rapture. Just think
[1:43:39] people will go right on preaching.
[1:43:42] They're saying believe they're getting
[1:43:45] saved. So they're not only preaching,
[1:43:47] they're having results. People are
[1:43:50] becoming uh immoved and uh and and and
[1:43:54] come believing that they're getting
[1:43:56] saved and they'll be adding to the
[1:43:58] church. So the churches will be growing.
[1:44:01] Number three, and building churches.
[1:44:03] Number four, they'll be building
[1:44:05] buildings to accommodate the growth of
[1:44:07] the congregation and going on just like
[1:44:11] they did in the days of Noah and so
[1:44:13] forth and not know it. And the rapture
[1:44:16] done passed.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Is that what he said?
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; And the rapture done passed. He said
[1:44:24] it's already happened and he didn't know
[1:44:26] it. There's hundreds of people disappear
[1:44:29] from the earth and people know nothing
[1:44:31] about where they went to. They can't
[1:44:33] account for it. Somebody was going
[1:44:36] somewhere. They never hear from them no
[1:44:39] more. And that could be the rapture. Now
[1:44:43] I come back to Mary. Now Mary is caught
[1:44:46] up into the details of a of an event.
[1:44:49] She's caught up. Things are happening.
[1:44:52] Jesus was taken in judgment. A trial is
[1:44:55] taking place. The disciples are are
[1:44:58] scattering. The power is gone. The
[1:45:01] message seems to have lost all of its
[1:45:03] all of its power and weight and uh and
[1:45:06] and the thousands I mean here's a woman
[1:45:08] say where the thousands go where did the
[1:45:13] crowds go? Where is where's all the
[1:45:16] supernatural? Where's the miracles?
[1:45:19] Where's all this? And and now she caught
[1:45:21] up in the event and and and and they've
[1:45:24] been there and they've seen him. They've
[1:45:25] seen the most dreadful of of deaths and
[1:45:28] and Christ crucified and the and the
[1:45:31] thieves on each side, the male factors
[1:45:34] with him and taken down and he's taken
[1:45:36] into a tomb and and the whole thing is
[1:45:39] just a one great big uh movement of of
[1:45:42] happening and you're caught in the
[1:45:45] event.
[1:45:46] She didn't know. There she is and she's
[1:45:50] looking at Jesus.
[1:45:52] She's looking straight at Jesus. She's
[1:45:55] looking at the word
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; who's now changed his mask.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, "And knew not
[1:46:04] that it was Jesus."
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Looking straight at the fulfillment of
[1:46:09] the word and knew not it was the
[1:46:11] fulfillment of the word. The word
[1:46:14] changing its form, changing its mass.
[1:46:17] He's changing from son of son of man to
[1:46:21] son of God. And in that change, she was
[1:46:24] not aware of that change taking place.
[1:46:28] But she didn't know that paradise had
[1:46:31] been emptied out.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; She didn't know. She didn't know that
[1:46:37] Satan had been stripped of the keys of
[1:46:40] death, hell, and the grave.
[1:46:44] What if someone had come to her marry?
[1:46:47] Why are you weeping? All the saints that
[1:46:49] have died in the faith, they're up
[1:46:52] walking in the streets of Jerusalem.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; That would have cheered her heart. Mary,
[1:46:59] the Lord has descended into the heart of
[1:47:01] the earth and has stripped Satan of the
[1:47:04] keys of death, hell, and the grave. He
[1:47:07] is now powerless.
[1:47:11] Mary,
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; the the seed of the woman has crushed
[1:47:16] the serpent's head.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; It's already happened.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; And it went through her and she was
[1:47:23] unaware. She didn't know all of that had
[1:47:26] happened. She didn't know that
[1:47:29] redemption had been purchased. She
[1:47:31] didn't know that the price had been
[1:47:33] paid. All of that had passed through.
[1:47:36] And she was completely unaware of it.
[1:47:38] She was caught up.
[1:47:42] Caught up in what was taking the details
[1:47:44] of everything.
[1:47:46] Just caught up.
[1:47:51] There's definitely
[1:47:53] something that was supernatural that was
[1:47:56] taking place.
[1:47:59] And I might add
[1:48:03] that when when he is changing his mask,
[1:48:08] that's a time that's most difficult.
[1:48:11] He's changing from son of man, the
[1:48:15] prophet,
[1:48:16] to take his office as a priest. He's
[1:48:20] changing
[1:48:22] from that eagle ministry, that prophet
[1:48:26] ministry to the priesthood. And he's
[1:48:29] going to ascend for you and I. He's
[1:48:32] going to ascend into the Holy of Holies.
[1:48:36] Going to ascend before into the very
[1:48:38] presence of God with the blood of the
[1:48:41] sacrifice, the atonement for all
[1:48:44] mankind. Can you believe the sins of the
[1:48:47] world? Mary knew nothing about that the
[1:48:50] sins of the price for the sins of the
[1:48:52] world had been paid for. She knew
[1:48:54] nothing. Even we knew nothing until a
[1:48:58] prophet declared in this day that when
[1:49:00] that blood flowed down from the cross,
[1:49:02] God was claiming back the earth once
[1:49:05] again for a future home for the bride,
[1:49:08] the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[1:49:10] bride. Oh, I mean, I wonder if we're
[1:49:12] aware of it this morning.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; She do nothing about that. It all was
[1:49:18] passing through. All of that passed
[1:49:20] through. The earth had been reclaimed.
[1:49:23] God in flesh, the spirit had left. The
[1:49:27] blood came down and identified the
[1:49:30] owner. He He took ownership of the earth
[1:49:32] once again. The head of the serpent was
[1:49:35] crushed. Paradise was emptied out. Satan
[1:49:38] was stripped. And she knew nothing about
[1:49:41] it. She's weeping.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; She thinks it's lost.
[1:49:47] what's happening
[1:49:49] and the angels
[1:49:51] are trying to give her another message.
[1:49:54] And the scripture says, "But Christ
[1:49:57] being come and high priest of good
[1:49:59] things to come by a greater and more
[1:50:01] perfect tabernacle, not made with hands,
[1:50:04] that is to say, not of this building,
[1:50:07] neither by the blood of bulls and goats
[1:50:10] and calves, but by his own blood he
[1:50:13] entered in once into the holy place,
[1:50:16] having obtained eternal redemption for
[1:50:19] us. Touch me not.
[1:50:22] I've not yet ascended.
[1:50:24] Oh, what a what a a moment of drama that
[1:50:29] is taking place. What an incredible
[1:50:31] moment. She's swept into the very
[1:50:35] uh the very vortex of one of the
[1:50:38] greatest moments of history.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; You think the rapture is going to be any
[1:50:47] different?
[1:50:48] Going to be exactly the same.
[1:50:54] going to be exactly the same.
[1:50:58] I've mentioned this. I'm going to bring
[1:51:00] it in way early. I want to bring this in
[1:51:02] at the end of the service.
[1:51:07] I won't say we had a convention, but
[1:51:09] I'll say a convention just took place.
[1:51:11] And I won't call it a convention.
[1:51:15] I'll put it this way.
[1:51:19] There was an inspiration begin to feel
[1:51:21] led of the Holy Spirit to have a
[1:51:25] gathering
[1:51:29] of ministers and a gathering of the
[1:51:32] believers and we don't know who's going
[1:51:34] to come and we just cast it out and
[1:51:38] invite all.
[1:51:42] We feel a certain direction.
[1:51:46] I've never pondered myself any any
[1:51:49] meetings longer than I pondered these
[1:51:52] for not weeks but months
[1:51:56] and pondered and sat alone, sat in my
[1:51:59] office here, sat at home and pondered
[1:52:03] prayerfully
[1:52:05] who should participate and who would
[1:52:07] speak and all of these things.
[1:52:11] And then they begin to gather and it was
[1:52:12] as though people rose up and they're
[1:52:16] going to look after this and they'll
[1:52:17] look after that and these will look
[1:52:18] after that and someone else said I'll
[1:52:21] take responsibility. I'll be in charge.
[1:52:22] I'll oversee it and all right. It was it
[1:52:26] was like I had my personally had nothing
[1:52:28] to do
[1:52:30] and then we're caught in the event. No,
[1:52:33] we're caught you know they they have to
[1:52:36] eat after the service. There's no
[1:52:37] restaurants open. and we all caught up
[1:52:39] in that and so what do we do and sisters
[1:52:42] rose up and said well we'll make some
[1:52:43] lunches or we'll we'll go and find and
[1:52:45] we're all caught up and the brothers are
[1:52:47] going to see and we're all caught up in
[1:52:49] the thing you know with them with the
[1:52:51] women it was the spices and we got to go
[1:52:53] and we we we got to go to the tomb and
[1:52:56] we got to you know anoint them with
[1:52:58] spices and oh oh well who's who's going
[1:53:01] to move the stone away the big stone
[1:53:03] who's going to roll that away and
[1:53:05] they're all caught up in it and and
[1:53:07] they're sad and the the whole life has
[1:53:10] just gone upside down for them and
[1:53:12] they're going back and forth and they're
[1:53:14] caught up in all the details
[1:53:17] and glorious spiritual things were
[1:53:20] already taking place and passing
[1:53:22] straight through and when we were
[1:53:25] afterwards it was like a a a
[1:53:28] dawning
[1:53:30] kind of awakening. Then I have brothers
[1:53:33] that have been ministering for 35 and 40
[1:53:36] years. Men who've been ministering the
[1:53:38] message for 30 years. And they're coming
[1:53:41] and asking asking me kind of in a not a
[1:53:45] question, but you know, how does this
[1:53:47] happen? We've had over a hundred
[1:53:50] ministers.
[1:53:52] We've had over a hundred ministers for
[1:53:56] eight and 10 and 12 days.
[1:54:02] I have never heard I never heard one
[1:54:05] sentence
[1:54:07] ah that would be just critical or sharp
[1:54:11] or someone putting forward their idea
[1:54:16] and and they they were asking me because
[1:54:18] they wanted want to know if I could give
[1:54:20] them an answer and I hadn't realized it
[1:54:27] but some had been bothering me
[1:54:30] for a very long time
[1:54:33] in this message for a very long time and
[1:54:36] I hear brother Brandham preach that
[1:54:39] especially some of his last services
[1:54:42] and come down on Pentecost
[1:54:45] that I was rejecting him and he said
[1:54:47] Pentecost you could never bring the
[1:54:50] rapture because you're too broke up
[1:54:54] you're too divided
[1:54:56] and I be smitten in my
[1:55:00] Oh god.
[1:55:02] Oh god. We have that.
[1:55:05] We have that also. This one. This one's
[1:55:08] this way. This one's got this agenda.
[1:55:10] That one's got that doctrine. This one's
[1:55:12] got that.
[1:55:15] And now it passed through.
[1:55:18] And I begin to try to assimilate. I
[1:55:20] begin trying to How did this happen?
[1:55:25] and begin to ask the Lord just in this
[1:55:26] last
[1:55:28] week or two,
[1:55:32] is it perhaps the prophet has spoken and
[1:55:35] said, declared openly, this age is the
[1:55:40] age of brotherly love?
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; This age is the age of brotherly love.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; That oh God, is there something that's
[1:55:51] already passed through? Is it moved
[1:55:54] through? Has it actually happened
[1:55:57] in our own local and we were too taken
[1:56:01] up and didn't realize not only brotherly
[1:56:04] love but what comes right down to
[1:56:06] brotherly love is a capstone which is
[1:56:10] love himself which is God himself
[1:56:13] uniting with his bride. I say to you my
[1:56:16] friends in the name of the Lord you
[1:56:18] should be awakened. You should be
[1:56:21] awakened and say, "God, don't let me
[1:56:24] miss any part of this.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Don't let me miss what's happening.
[1:56:31] Not what's going to happen. What's
[1:56:33] happening, what's happening now, what's
[1:56:35] taking place now." And I would challenge
[1:56:37] anybody. You tell me how a hundred
[1:56:40] ministers over a hundred
[1:56:43] who come from many different places in
[1:56:45] many different countries and have had
[1:56:47] many different doctrines that have been
[1:56:49] very precious to them and it was all
[1:56:52] laid down. It was all laid down and
[1:56:55] there was no instruction along with it.
[1:56:57] It was it was the oneness of the Holy
[1:56:59] Spirit and they were swept up into it
[1:57:01] and afterwards said this was marvelous.
[1:57:04] How did it happen? I can tell you no man
[1:57:08] engineered it. No man, no man could
[1:57:11] bring that about. I want to give glory
[1:57:13] to God in these last few minutes of this
[1:57:15] service for God's supernatural hand. I
[1:57:19] want to give acknowledgement that God,
[1:57:21] we're in the midst of something that God
[1:57:23] did
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; and is doing. And I say, oh God, let it
[1:57:29] continue.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Let this age of perfect love.
[1:57:33] We're interested in perfect faith. I'm
[1:57:35] interested in perfect love. Let the
[1:57:37] capstone cap my life. Let the capstone
[1:57:41] cap your life. Let the capstone
[1:57:46] cap this congregation
[1:57:49] and cap the bride.
[1:57:53] I got a phone call from Nigeria
[1:57:56] and left me a long voice message. Said,
[1:57:59] "We're listening to the services." This
[1:58:01] minister said, I don't know his name.
[1:58:04] I've never laid eyes on him, but he
[1:58:06] said, I I'd like to make contact. And he
[1:58:08] named two of the brothers that were
[1:58:10] ministering. He said, we've heard that
[1:58:11] service and we've heard that service.
[1:58:13] How can I contact these brothers? There
[1:58:16] was just a thirst, just a desire, the
[1:58:19] spirit of the atmosphere of the meetings
[1:58:21] coming through and going yawn yonder in
[1:58:24] many, many places. And uh I've had phone
[1:58:27] calls from brothers that very rarely if
[1:58:30] ever in many many years would call. They
[1:58:33] called and they drank.
[1:58:36] They called and said the care
[1:58:39] that you people gave for us. We feel so
[1:58:42] humbled at the care. We feel so humbled
[1:58:46] at the presence at the spirit that was
[1:58:49] with all the people and the brothers.
[1:58:53] and I felt I had to come this morning.
[1:58:57] This isn't patting you on the back.
[1:59:01] We're not here to pat anybody on the
[1:59:03] back. We're here to say,
[1:59:07] is something going through us?
[1:59:09] Is something going through? Is something
[1:59:11] divine? Is something supernatural
[1:59:13] happening? And the rapture will be
[1:59:17] exactly the same. And friends, I
[1:59:21] preached here for a lot of years.
[1:59:23] along with other brothers.
[1:59:26] Brother Lance is almost 30 years.
[1:59:28] Brother Tom is almost 30 years. Brother
[1:59:31] DJ has rose up to be a minister. Brother
[1:59:34] John Andy's brother Andy's is here and
[1:59:36] has ministered and other people have
[1:59:38] ministered for many years. And brother
[1:59:40] Tony and is coming back from China. We
[1:59:44] don't want to get caught up in those
[1:59:45] details.
[1:59:48] We've ministered for many, many years.
[1:59:51] We don't want anybody.
[1:59:54] I don't desire anybody.
[1:59:58] I wouldn't want to say it coming out of
[2:00:00] your lips.
[2:00:03] Wasn't there supposed to be this and
[2:00:05] wasn't there supposed to be that?
[2:00:08] I would like to think that we're so in
[2:00:10] tune
[2:00:12] so that the ministry would be able to
[2:00:14] say to you, "Friends, children,
[2:00:16] something's moving. We've just
[2:00:19] something's happening. It's just moving
[2:00:21] through. Where did that kind of Where
[2:00:23] did that kind of un Where did it come
[2:00:25] from? I want to ask you, what dropped on
[2:00:28] to over a hundred ministers? What
[2:00:30] dropped onto them?
[2:00:33] They're so thirsting and and just
[2:00:35] receiving from each other's spirit and
[2:00:38] back and forth and such a blending, such
[2:00:40] a glorious blending. How does it happen?
[2:00:43] How do you get a hundred preachers?
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about just people. I'm
[2:00:49] talking about preachers, men who are
[2:00:51] strong, men who can be opinionated, men
[2:00:53] who are have their own personal vision,
[2:00:55] and men who are driven,
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; men who are burdened.
[2:01:00] And yet a moment arrived. You lived it.
[2:01:05] It passed through you.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; It passed through your church. It passed
[2:01:10] through the meetings. It was none less
[2:01:13] than the great almighty spirit of God.
[2:01:18] Do you hear me?
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; It was none less than the spirit of God.
[2:01:22] While while Mary was there, that same
[2:01:24] spirit went and raised him out of the
[2:01:26] tomb
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; and she knew nothing about it. Passed
[2:01:30] through her.
[2:01:34] I tell you, great things be happening
[2:01:36] right at this moment. Right at this
[2:01:38] moment.
[2:01:40] Where do we know? How do we know where
[2:01:42] we're at in this process of the rapture?
[2:01:45] How do we know where we're at?
[2:01:47] wouldn't want a soul. But in the sound
[2:01:50] of my voice or on the internet to ever
[2:01:53] have to say, "I thought this was I
[2:01:56] thought this I thought something else. I
[2:01:58] was trying to get myself ready. I was
[2:02:00] trying to
[2:02:02] You better stop trying."
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; You better just get there.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; You better say, "Today, it's over and
[2:02:08] done. I'm finished with the world. I'm
[2:02:11] finished with Satan. I'm finished with
[2:02:13] all this unbelief. I'm finished with
[2:02:15] this doubt. I'm going to believe on
[2:02:18] where I'm at. I'm going to believe the
[2:02:19] ministry of the word. I'm going to
[2:02:21] believe what the prophet of God has
[2:02:23] said.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Do I hear an amen from you?
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Don't get left.
[2:02:31] Don't be one of those
[2:02:34] that has to hear somebody and might be a
[2:02:37] message preacher too who's proclaimed it
[2:02:41] has to say, "You know what, folks? I
[2:02:44] think we've missed something.
[2:02:48] I don't want to be in that service.
[2:02:53] I don't want to be there.
[2:02:57] I don't want to be there. I don't want
[2:02:59] to be one that sits in a gathering said
[2:03:02] you know what
[2:03:05] few months ago I felt there was some
[2:03:07] great stir in everything but I was too
[2:03:09] engaged. I was too taken up. I was too I
[2:03:13] was too involved.
[2:03:19] And it's all through the scripture. It's
[2:03:21] all through the scripture. And then they
[2:03:23] remembered what he said. I want to at
[2:03:25] least be in tune. Oh, Holy Spirit, keep
[2:03:29] me snug right up. Holy Spirit, keep me
[2:03:32] straining at the reigns. Holy Spirit,
[2:03:35] keep me right in tune with what you're
[2:03:38] doing. What you're doing. What you're
[2:03:40] doing. not what you did do. I don't want
[2:03:43] history. I want now present now. I want
[2:03:46] a God
[2:03:48] that I can speak to.
[2:03:51] I want a God that can talk to me.
[2:03:55] Want a God that will tell me things and
[2:03:56] I want to have a heart that'll respond
[2:03:58] to it instantly.
[2:04:11] I'm just barely started the service, but
[2:04:14] I'm not going to belabor the point.
[2:04:17] I feel that the Holy Spirit has said
[2:04:20] pretty much what he's wanted to say to
[2:04:23] the congregation today.
[2:04:25] But I can tell you friends,
[2:04:28] this is very, very much very heavy on my
[2:04:30] heart. And I'm going to close,
[2:04:35] but I'm going to close with this.
[2:04:37] Mary and those disciples
[2:04:40] were going through their their time at
[2:04:44] the changing of his mask and that was
[2:04:49] the great changing his mask. God was
[2:04:52] actually changing his mask.
[2:04:55] The prophet says he never changes
[2:04:57] nature,
[2:04:59] never changes character, but he changes
[2:05:02] his mask.
[2:05:05] and he's here now to act out and we
[2:05:08] happen to be in a a little different
[2:05:10] position.
[2:05:12] I want you to notice in the unveiling of
[2:05:14] God especially
[2:05:16] in the message the unveiling of God and
[2:05:18] I have all the quotes here I don't have
[2:05:20] time and he says in the during the
[2:05:23] church ages he was son of God
[2:05:27] spirit because he had god is a spirit he
[2:05:32] so he was son of god god's a spirit so
[2:05:35] he came in the age of the new testament
[2:05:38] as the holy spirit son of god God on
[2:05:42] earth he had to be son of man prophet to
[2:05:46] fulfill the scriptures which were spoken
[2:05:49] of that time. So a god had to become
[2:05:52] flesh he became son of man prophet to
[2:05:56] live out that era. But when he changed
[2:05:58] his mask from son of man to son of god
[2:06:02] it threw the believers into a into a
[2:06:05] dilemma of trying to follow what was
[2:06:08] happening. Now children,
[2:06:13] brother Brandham says at the end of the
[2:06:17] church ages, he's been son of God during
[2:06:20] the dispensation of Holy Spirit. At the
[2:06:22] end,
[2:06:25] he has to be revealed as son of man
[2:06:27] again. So has to change his mask from
[2:06:30] son of God to son of man just in that
[2:06:32] breach because he's changing from son of
[2:06:34] man now. He has to change then to son of
[2:06:36] David. So from son of God to son of man,
[2:06:39] from son of man to son of David. And
[2:06:41] we're caught in a double
[2:06:44] action of his changing. And things I can
[2:06:48] say to you will move at a different pace
[2:06:51] and they will move more mysteriously.
[2:06:54] So, let's not get caught up in all the
[2:06:57] physical things and, you know, we've got
[2:06:59] church and we got a convention, we got
[2:07:01] this and oh, we have the internet and we
[2:07:03] have to do this, we have to do that and
[2:07:05] and things in your home and things in
[2:07:07] your life and things in your business.
[2:07:09] Fine. Keep your mind stayed upon God.
[2:07:14] Where am I at, Lord? Where are we at?
[2:07:17] What has taken place in another realm?
[2:07:20] Oh, God. Oh, when the resurrection takes
[2:07:23] place, you're not going to see floods of
[2:07:25] people walking all over the place. God
[2:07:28] might show you one because uh they can
[2:07:31] appear and disappear.
[2:07:34] when it when uh paradise was emptied out
[2:07:39] and the Old Testament saints and the
[2:07:41] prophets and the seers and the sages
[2:07:44] were walking and were seen in the
[2:07:46] streets of Jerusalem. Only a few people,
[2:07:49] Matthew is the only one that recorded
[2:07:51] it.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; I don't know who saw it, but only
[2:07:54] Matthew recorded it. Only believers saw
[2:07:56] it. And maybe not all believers saw it.
[2:07:59] Some saw it. Something had happened.
[2:08:02] Mary's weeping, but but but the saints
[2:08:04] are in the streets of Jerusalem. They're
[2:08:07] not weeping.
[2:08:09] Are you with me, folks? You understand
[2:08:11] what's coming out of my soul this
[2:08:13] morning. They weren't weeping. They were
[2:08:16] rejoicing. Hallelujah. Their king had
[2:08:20] come. The redeemer had come and emptied
[2:08:23] out paradise, shaking the keys of death,
[2:08:26] hell, and the grave in victory and
[2:08:28] taking them out.
[2:08:32] He said, "Who is it?" He said, "It's the
[2:08:34] seed of the woman." Ezekiel said, "Who
[2:08:36] is it?" He said, "It's the wheel within
[2:08:38] the wheel." Daniel said, "Who is it?"
[2:08:41] It's a stone cut out of the mountain
[2:08:43] without hands.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Who is it?
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; The Lord of glory.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Conquer death, hell, and the grave. No
[2:08:56] man takes my life from me. I lay it
[2:08:58] down. I take it up again. I say to you
[2:09:01] children, what's it worth? What's it
[2:09:03] worth to be involved in that? I say, oh,
[2:09:05] let me be caught up in that. Let me be
[2:09:08] enthused. Let that be my life. Let that
[2:09:10] be the focus of everything I live for.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh God, like Apostle Paul said,
[2:09:24] don't let me be a cast off after
[2:09:26] preaching." Not he didn't I don't
[2:09:28] believe he's saying lost but don't let
[2:09:30] the thing pass by me. Don't let me be a
[2:09:32] cast off after I've preached the gospel
[2:09:34] and labored and given all this and
[2:09:37] traveled in all his mission journeys. So
[2:09:39] don't let me be a cast off. Don't let
[2:09:42] you having sat here and in the church
[2:09:44] and having the fellowship and having the
[2:09:46] wonderful communion with the saints and
[2:09:48] putting in your tithes and your
[2:09:50] offerings and supporting the mission
[2:09:51] work. Don't let it be that you just get
[2:09:53] caught up in life. Don't let you young
[2:09:56] people some say I I came to church and I
[2:09:58] heard it and I heard it. It just becomes
[2:10:00] old and stale to me. It's going to pass
[2:10:02] through you.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be an event outside of
[2:10:07] you. It's going to pass through you.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; You're going to be sitting right here
[2:10:11] and the rapture,
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; the resurrection
[2:10:15] passes through.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Maybe one in this church or two or three
[2:10:19] will see it. I don't know. the
[2:10:21] resurrected.
[2:10:23] But I'm going to be on my toes. I'm
[2:10:26] going to be alert. I'm going to be
[2:10:28] waiting. I'm going to be listening. I'm
[2:10:31] not going to get caught up with
[2:10:33] everything of the world. I'm going to be
[2:10:35] on my toes.
[2:10:37] Sure, we have to work. Sure, we have to
[2:10:38] pay bills. Sure, we do this. We buy and
[2:10:40] we sell and whatever more. But that's
[2:10:42] not what our life is all about. We do
[2:10:44] that for this.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:48] Glory to God. Glory to God. Glory to
[2:10:51] God.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; Ram said he's always veiled himself.
[2:11:07] Veiled himself in a pillar of fire.
[2:11:08] Vailed himself in a in a cloud.
[2:11:13] Veiled himself in the prophets.
[2:11:17] Veiled himself in the body of Jesus
[2:11:19] Christ.
[2:11:23] And after that veil was tore at Calvary
[2:11:27] and some of the people begin to wake up.
[2:11:33] Roman soldier
[2:11:35] woke up too late.
[2:11:37] Surely this is the son of God.
[2:11:43] Sorry sir, it's passed through. You
[2:11:47] should have recognized him when your
[2:11:49] friends were stabbing him
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; in his heart. That's when you wake up.
[2:11:55] Let us wake up. Here's a brother. What
[2:11:58] What's the difference between me saying
[2:11:59] it and Brother Brandham saying, "Pinch
[2:12:00] your conscience.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Let's be awake. Let's be alert.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Say, here I am, Lord.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; I'm here.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; I'm here for you to speak to me. I'm
[2:12:13] here for you to pick my conscience. I'm
[2:12:16] here for you to alert me, oh God, don't
[2:12:18] let me miss a single thing that you're
[2:12:20] doing. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[2:12:22] Father, send forth the Holy Spirit. You
[2:12:25] that brought forth the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:12:27] from the dead. You that revealed to Mary
[2:12:30] who he was and what he was and that he
[2:12:33] had changed his mask. And they were
[2:12:35] caught up in the vortex in the caught up
[2:12:38] in the very central part of this great
[2:12:42] movement that was happening. And here we
[2:12:44] are. Here we are, oh God. Here we are
[2:12:46] once again. We're caught up in the
[2:12:48] consummation of the ages. We're caught
[2:12:50] up at the end of the time. And I believe
[2:12:53] exactly what your prophet has declared.
[2:12:55] There'll be churches. There'll be
[2:12:56] preaching. And oh God, no doubt someone
[2:12:59] will be preaching behind this pulpit.
[2:13:00] Don't let it be me. Don't let it be any
[2:13:03] of the ministers out of here. Don't let
[2:13:04] them, oh God, be any of the part of it.
[2:13:07] Don't let anybody who's here, oh God,
[2:13:09] come in and say, "Oh Lord, I I need
[2:13:12] something special.
[2:13:15] Lord,
[2:13:17] it's going to it's something going to
[2:13:19] pass through. A rapture change of our
[2:13:22] bodies going to take place. This is your
[2:13:24] word. This is your promise.
[2:13:27] I pray, Father, that mothers will not be
[2:13:30] so caught up with motherhood and young
[2:13:32] people will not be so caught up with
[2:13:33] their studies and that men will not be
[2:13:35] so caught up with their their
[2:13:37] responsibilities of providing living
[2:13:39] that we do not have this as the number
[2:13:41] one focus of our lives. this great
[2:13:43] rapture, this great change of our
[2:13:45] bodies, this great resurrection is going
[2:13:47] to take place. We want to say, "Lord,
[2:13:49] I'm here. Here I am. Call my name. Call
[2:13:53] my name. My ears are listening. I'm
[2:13:55] ready to answer. Here I am, Lord. Send
[2:13:58] me whatever you want. Say what you
[2:14:00] would, Lord." And your servant will hear
[2:14:03] and say, "I will. I will respond to you,
[2:14:07] oh God.
[2:14:09] Whatever it might be in this hour, this
[2:14:12] tremendous hour, I'm trying to absorb,
[2:14:14] Lord, what's taken place in the last few
[2:14:17] weeks. Your spirit is moved in a very,
[2:14:20] very unusual way. And we want to build
[2:14:23] and go on from there.
[2:14:27] Father,
[2:14:28] touch hearts.
[2:14:32] And I'm asking
[2:14:35] I'm asking specifically
[2:14:38] that you will touch people in such a way
[2:14:41] that that old things that have held them
[2:14:45] back. Lord, I think of some of our youth
[2:14:48] and young people go through the same
[2:14:51] cycle as our brother Gideon Matif spoke.
[2:14:55] They need to break that cycle. They need
[2:14:58] to bring an end to it. I pray that even
[2:15:01] this morning, oh God, if anyone's caught
[2:15:04] in a cycle that say this has to end,
[2:15:07] that's the enemy that's trying to hold
[2:15:09] me back. Enemy that's trying to keep me
[2:15:11] dragged down. Break that in the name of
[2:15:14] Jesus Christ. Let that chain be broken.
[2:15:17] Let the believers call on the name of
[2:15:19] the Lord and let them say, you should
[2:15:21] rise to your feet and say, "Satan, this
[2:15:23] is the end of it. I'm done with you. I'm
[2:15:26] done with the world. I'm done with your
[2:15:28] enticements. I'm done with all of this.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; It's a quiet congregation. We should
[2:15:36] call on the name of the Lord. Oh God,
[2:15:39] let it be a completed work. Don't let a
[2:15:41] thing pass by, pass through me. I want
[2:15:44] to be the recipient and receive the full
[2:15:46] benefit of it
[2:15:48] in the name of Jesus Christ. In the name
[2:15:52] of Jesus Christ, all power and all hail
[2:15:55] in the name of Jesus, let angels
[2:15:58] prostrate fall. Let the power Lord Jesus
[2:16:01] that you you purchase for your bride.
[2:16:04] Let that resurrection power, let that
[2:16:06] virtue, let that revelation, oh God,
[2:16:09] sweep through every being, every single
[2:16:12] person that is in need of it at this
[2:16:14] time, oh God. And I stand against every
[2:16:17] demon of resistance. I stand against
[2:16:20] every hindering spirit that would try to
[2:16:22] keep the people, oh God, bound down and
[2:16:25] keep them from accepting and receiving
[2:16:27] what you purchased for them. Oh God, in
[2:16:31] Jesus Christ's name, let the people of
[2:16:33] God call on it. You call on it for
[2:16:35] yourself.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; You pray.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You do the praying.
[2:16:45] You're the one who wants deliverance.
[2:16:46] You do the praying. You call on his
[2:16:48] name. Don't wait on the preacher.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Father, you do it in the name of Jesus
[2:16:57] Christ.
[2:16:58] I receive it. I accept it. God bless
[2:17:02] you, young man. I believe it. I believe
[2:17:05] this promise. I accept it. Lord, let me
[2:17:09] let me be in tune with what you're
[2:17:11] doing,
[2:17:13] oh God.
[2:17:19] [Music]
[2:17:21] Let your voice be heard.
[2:17:23] Let your soul cry out.
[2:17:26] Let desperation take place. Don't stand
[2:17:29] as it just as another service. Call out
[2:17:32] to him
[2:17:34] in the desperation of your soul. Oh God,
[2:17:37] I don't want to miss anything. I want to
[2:17:40] be in tune. Finetune me.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:46] Oh God, let every chain be broken,
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; every spirit defeated
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. This is not
[2:17:56] just another service. This is not just
[2:17:58] another Sunday morning. This is a
[2:18:00] meeting of deliverance at this moment.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; Maybe one, maybe two, maybe 50, I don't
[2:18:08] know
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; for you. May the very nature of Jesus
[2:18:14] Christ come your way.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; May the very nature of Jesus Christ
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; come and be born.
[2:18:24] Oh God.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Can you say in faith, I'm going out of
[2:18:43] this building a different person?
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; Going out of this building free.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; A free man. A free woman.
[2:18:55] [Music]
[2:19:00] What an hour we're in.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; There's never
[2:19:05] been a day
[2:19:08] like this day
[2:19:11] to me.
[2:19:13] There's
[2:19:15] a day
[2:19:17] like this. Satan in faith. I see.

[2:20:51] there's
[2:20:53] a day brother.
[2:20:56] Brother Tom,
[2:20:58] Brother.
[2:21:02] [Music]
[2:21:16] [Music]
[2:21:24] Listen folks, while we're praying for
[2:21:25] this sister, I want to say to you with
[2:21:27] this Bible in my hand, don't you accept
[2:21:30] 50%. Don't you accept 75%.
[2:21:34] You walk out of here today and say
[2:21:36] whatever I I don't know what God has
[2:21:38] spoken to you, but whatever he's spoken
[2:21:40] to you, whatever he's given you faith to
[2:21:42] believe, believe it.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you haven't been free up
[2:21:46] to this time, but there's something in
[2:21:48] your spirit says I can be free, then
[2:21:50] don't you settle for anything less than
[2:21:52] absolute liberty. Amen. Absolutely. Do
[2:21:55] you haven't been able to have
[2:21:57] deliverance over something? Don't you
[2:21:59] accept a partial deliverance? Say, "I'm
[2:22:01] walking out of here delivered in the
[2:22:03] name of Jesus Christ." Hallelujah.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; If your heart and soul is saying, "I've
[2:22:11] been immature. I've not matured in the
[2:22:14] way I should have spiritually. I've just
[2:22:16] drifted along." You want to say with
[2:22:18] your Bible in your hand, that's over.
[2:22:21] Say it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:22:23] That's over. I want that spirit to move
[2:22:25] through me and mature me.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; If natural life could mature me from a
[2:22:31] girl into a womanhood, from a boy into a
[2:22:33] manhood, then surely the Holy Spirit,
[2:22:35] the author of the Almighty God, can move
[2:22:38] through me and mature me spiritually
[2:22:42] where things that have bothered you in
[2:22:43] the past will bother you no more.
[2:22:46] I say it again. Things that bothered you
[2:22:48] in the past will bother you no more. I'm
[2:22:51] done with this childhood stuff. I'm done
[2:22:53] with this little things that trouble a
[2:22:56] believer. I'm finished with it.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the kind of church. That's
[2:23:02] the kind of church that the that the
[2:23:04] Lord Jesus Christ purchased. He
[2:23:06] purchased a delivered church.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; He purchased a powerful church. He
[2:23:11] purchased a church where the
[2:23:13] demonstration of the gospel is amongst
[2:23:15] them.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Great things happened in
[2:23:19] brother Brandham's day. We're not living
[2:23:21] on his testimony. You're living on your
[2:23:23] own testimony.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; What you believe?
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; We believe it.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:23:41] I'm not coming to church just to have a
[2:23:44] little, you know, a little social time.
[2:23:47] We're here to meet with God.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; When I tell you that he's here and you
[2:23:55] know that he's here and your soul is
[2:23:58] saying he's here, then don't go out of
[2:24:00] here. Don't be one that says, "I looked
[2:24:02] at Jesus, but I knew not it was Jesus."
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; So where is he standing? right beside
[2:24:10] you.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; He's veiled. The same prophet said he's
[2:24:14] veiled in the body of his bride. He's
[2:24:17] veiled in human flesh again. He the same
[2:24:20] Jesus Christ.
[2:24:23] [Music]
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; I can't get a song off my mind.
[2:24:32] I don't want you to clap. It's a
[2:24:34] clapping song, but I don't want you to
[2:24:35] clap. I want you to be focused on the
[2:24:38] words and sing it. Behold, what manner
[2:24:42] of man is this.
[2:24:46] Hallelujah.
[2:24:48] Who stands between God in man. His eyes
[2:24:52] are as a flame of fire and his fan is in
[2:24:54] his hand. John saw him in the seven
[2:24:57] churches as the son in in
[2:25:03] glorious something.
[2:25:06] Behold, what manner of man is this? He's
[2:25:09] the Lord of glory. Who is he? He's the
[2:25:12] great I am. Who is he? He's the alpha
[2:25:15] and omega.
[2:25:17] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:25:19] forever. He's in this building. He's in
[2:25:21] his people. That's thus sayeth the word
[2:25:24] of
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; He's in you.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; He's in me.

[2:30:06] Thank you. The Lord bless each one of
[2:30:08] you this morning here. I tell you, I
[2:30:12] didn't know where to kind of dance up
[2:30:13] here, but
[2:30:15] God is here this morning.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; And I if he's dealing with your heart, I
[2:30:20] might I don't want to try to preach. I
[2:30:22] just brought my Bible to show you
[2:30:24] something brother Bound done many a
[2:30:25] times and it may help you but you know
[2:30:30] we're in a late hour and time is swiftly
[2:30:34] going by.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; You know you're I look at brother Bisco
[2:30:38] and I we're old. I was young when I came
[2:30:40] into this message. 17 years old was the
[2:30:43] first time I was in brother Bound's
[2:30:45] meetings. I raised my family, you know,
[2:30:49] and as they go on, you think, well, if
[2:30:51] I'd have done this, if I'd have been
[2:30:53] more sincere about praying with them, if
[2:30:56] I'd have been more sincere about reading
[2:30:58] the word, you know, life just goes by so
[2:31:01] quickly, and we're going to do certain
[2:31:03] things. It's just like he's preaching
[2:31:06] here this morning. One morning,
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; if you don't make that rapture, you're
[2:31:11] going to wake up and realize all of
[2:31:13] these things of the tribulation is
[2:31:15] coming up on you and you're going to
[2:31:17] say, "I thought there was going to be a
[2:31:20] rapture."
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; And then they'll come back a little
[2:31:22] voice, it's already over and you didn't
[2:31:25] know it. I had the privilege. Well, let
[2:31:28] me tell you one other one first that I
[2:31:30] was in when the when the priest brought
[2:31:32] brother Brown the Bible. And this may
[2:31:34] give you and let you see how you can
[2:31:37] miss things. There was probably
[2:31:41] 5,000 people in that meeting and brother
[2:31:44] Bound was standing here at the platform
[2:31:46] like this and u he had his Bible and he
[2:31:50] was going through it and you've probably
[2:31:52] heard it on tapes. He started reading
[2:31:54] from the 17th chapter because the pages
[2:31:56] were glued together. And I was in the
[2:31:59] back of the building against the wall.
[2:32:02] And and all of a sudden, I seen this
[2:32:04] priest come walking up and he had all
[2:32:06] these crosses on him and his uh robe and
[2:32:09] everything. And as he come, he began to
[2:32:12] stand here at the side like this to
[2:32:14] brother Banner. And we couldn't hear
[2:32:17] nothing that he was saying. You couldn't
[2:32:18] hear nothing. We didn't know what was
[2:32:21] going on. I was beating a wall with my
[2:32:23] fist and I says, "Why don't somebody
[2:32:26] just get that guy and get him out of the
[2:32:27] way?"
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; Now, this is how you can miss things.
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; I was standing right there in that
[2:32:33] meeting. I didn't have a clue what was
[2:32:35] going on,
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; But I said, "Why don't they get him out
[2:32:39] of the way?"
[2:32:41] You know, and brother Brown uh later on
[2:32:44] he left that day and the next day he was
[2:32:47] in Tucson, he began to preach this day,
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; this scripture is fulfilled. Do you
[2:32:53] realize I do today that that was one of
[2:32:56] the greatest things in this hour taking
[2:32:58] place
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; and I didn't even know it. Matter of
[2:33:01] fact, I didn't know it the next night
[2:33:03] because we didn't go down to Tucson. I
[2:33:05] didn't know it until I heard the tape
[2:33:07] from Jeffersonville this day. this
[2:33:09] scripture and I sat there and I thought
[2:33:11] to myself
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; how easy it is to miss God.
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; It's very easy.
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; But I had the privilege of my first
[2:33:19] meeting. I think it was around 1961.
[2:33:23] My wife and I wasn't married at that
[2:33:25] time, but I went over to uh you know the
[2:33:28] the Bay Area there around Los Angeles is
[2:33:31] so big. I don't know which town it was
[2:33:33] even in. And I was young I wasn't even
[2:33:36] interested in that. But uh I had heard a
[2:33:38] little uh younger in my life about
[2:33:41] brother Brown from my mother. She was in
[2:33:42] his meetings in 1942
[2:33:45] and and through there when brother Brown
[2:33:47] came to Fris there's no tapes of it. And
[2:33:50] she had told me when I was 14 years old
[2:33:52] she says if you ever hear of a man
[2:33:55] William Brown she says you better try to
[2:33:57] get in his meetings.
[2:33:59] I forgot about it. I didn't even
[2:34:01] remember the name. And uh I' we had a
[2:34:05] pastor I began to this name, Brother
[2:34:07] Brham. Uh he never did really believe
[2:34:10] this message. He never did even follow
[2:34:12] it, but he encouraged the people to go
[2:34:14] to brother Brown's meetings because he
[2:34:16] knew they'd get healed.
[2:34:18] And uh so I when I heard him tell him
[2:34:21] about there was going to be one on the
[2:34:23] West Coast, I went over to it, me and
[2:34:25] about five other friends of mine, and we
[2:34:28] were setting back about halfway in the
[2:34:30] meeting. And there was probably 10,000
[2:34:32] more people in this meeting. And you got
[2:34:34] to realize when you're setting back five
[2:34:36] six thousand people in front of you.
[2:34:38] Brother Bound was very uh when he came
[2:34:40] out you could hardly It was small. It
[2:34:42] was small and I remember about 15 20
[2:34:46] minutes before the meeting everyone was
[2:34:49] bowed their heads. It got so quiet in
[2:34:53] that meeting that it scared you. I was
[2:34:56] scared because if you ever seen 10,000
[2:34:59] people get so quiet that you could drop
[2:35:01] a pin and almost hear it. But he there
[2:35:05] was such reverence and such respect. It
[2:35:08] scared me. And when I remember the song
[2:35:12] leader began to and they asked everyone
[2:35:13] to bow their heads and they started they
[2:35:16] were singing and they bowed their heads
[2:35:17] and the next thing you know this little
[2:35:19] man was out there and he says good
[2:35:21] evening and we raised our heads and I
[2:35:24] began to look you could barely see and
[2:35:26] brother Brown began to preach. I don't
[2:35:28] remember a thing he preached because I
[2:35:31] was so excited. I remember when he came
[2:35:34] to the end of the service, he had a
[2:35:36] prayer line. He came down to this man
[2:35:39] that was in a wheelchair. He was sitting
[2:35:41] down like this and he told the man in
[2:35:43] the wheelchair. He says, "Now," he began
[2:35:46] to tell him. He told him five or six
[2:35:48] things that was wrong with him. Heart
[2:35:50] condition. Uh his kidneys was failing
[2:35:53] him. I remember some of those. And he
[2:35:55] just tells the man, he says, "Sir," he
[2:35:57] said, "you're hope so hopeless." He
[2:35:59] said, "You only got one hope." He said,
[2:36:02] "That's get up out of that wheelchair
[2:36:03] and push it out of here." Now, anybody
[2:36:06] could see that the man was couldn't
[2:36:07] hardly get up. He just help us. And
[2:36:10] brother Brown, this is one thing I
[2:36:12] noticed. He was very confident
[2:36:15] wherever he was at.
[2:36:18] He knew God was there.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; And he never uh he never lost control of
[2:36:24] nothing.
[2:36:25] You never seen a man like this. He just
[2:36:27] never lost control. The man didn't move.
[2:36:30] He just went right on through and the
[2:36:33] pillar of fire was moving. He says, "I
[2:36:35] want you to see it. It's right here. I
[2:36:38] raised up trying to see with all my
[2:36:40] heart. I never could see it." And I
[2:36:42] found out later that there's very few
[2:36:43] people ever seen it. I want to remind
[2:36:46] you something. The pillar of fire only
[2:36:48] appeared three times on the earth. It
[2:36:51] was once in the time of Moses, once in
[2:36:54] the time of Jesus, and it was promised
[2:36:56] in the end time. And he came in our day.
[2:37:00] And uh so brother Brown began to call
[2:37:02] this girl that had epileptics. He had
[2:37:04] called several and he came to this girl.
[2:37:06] She was back like this. And um this this
[2:37:10] girl went into one of these fits and it
[2:37:13] was the most hideous screams you ever
[2:37:15] heard. And now he says now I want the
[2:37:17] people he says I want you to bow your
[2:37:19] heads and don't look up.
[2:37:22] And uh I remember when he told us to bow
[2:37:25] our heads. I was with these other Now
[2:37:27] you got to realize we was just young
[2:37:28] people oursel and we bowed our head and
[2:37:31] we didn't know what he was doing. He was
[2:37:32] wanting so bad to see what he was doing.
[2:37:35] But he just talked to the girl and then
[2:37:37] she began to scream and and just fall
[2:37:40] down and and it just got his and he just
[2:37:43] said I I could hear him say, "Satan,
[2:37:46] come out of that woman."
[2:37:49] And pretty soon he told the people, he
[2:37:51] said, "Now you can raise your head." And
[2:37:53] so as as the people began to raise his
[2:37:56] head, this lady was standing there, the
[2:37:58] young girl in her right mind
[2:38:01] just praising the Lord. He went around
[2:38:04] to several other. There was a man that
[2:38:06] if I remember correctly, that had one
[2:38:09] foot shorter than another against the
[2:38:10] wall. The man's foot came out. Then he
[2:38:14] said, "Now the man is getting up out of
[2:38:17] the wheelchair."
[2:38:18] And this guy's legs just shot out. He
[2:38:21] got out. He pushed. There was a big
[2:38:23] center aisle probably three times as
[2:38:25] wide as this one. Went right down that
[2:38:27] auditorium. He came right down that I
[2:38:30] got out looking at him and follow him. I
[2:38:32] could not. This man came out of this
[2:38:35] chair just pushing it right down the
[2:38:36] aisle.
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; Pushing his own chair. Amen.
[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; There's one other should I tell them
[2:38:40] about when women and my wife.
[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; Well, this was in the power of
[2:38:44] transformation. I was in several
[2:38:46] services, quite a few. I was there at
[2:38:49] harvest time, a lot of them. But on the
[2:38:51] power of transformation, it was a
[2:38:53] breakfast. And um uh that uh by the way
[2:38:58] that meeting just went hysterical after
[2:39:01] that man came. It just I mean that was
[2:39:03] the end of the meeting. You couldn't
[2:39:05] hear brother M no more because the
[2:39:06] people just went hysterical when the man
[2:39:08] went down the aisle with the chair. And
[2:39:10] I went home from that meeting telling my
[2:39:13] brothers and my dad and just about every
[2:39:17] one of them follow this message now. I
[2:39:19] told them that Bible days are here
[2:39:22] again.
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; And I says the G I was raised in a
[2:39:26] United Pentecostal church. I had found
[2:39:28] the Lord before I ever met Brother
[2:39:30] Brown. And I says, "The Jesus that I
[2:39:33] heard so many stories about is alive.
[2:39:37] &gt;&gt; He lives. I seen him moving today in a
[2:39:41] little man."
[2:39:42] &gt;&gt; And I come home and I've never lost that
[2:39:44] testimony that he is alive.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; Then after me and my wife got married,
[2:39:49] we was after brother Brown preached
[2:39:51] choosing of a bride, we left California.
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; About the week after I got up, we had
[2:39:58] prayed. My wife said, "Well, what are
[2:40:00] you praying about? You already heard. We
[2:40:02] b said we need to leave." And I said,
[2:40:04] "Well, we had been taught in the
[2:40:06] Pentecostal church to put out a fleece
[2:40:08] before the Lord. That's all I knew to
[2:40:09] do." So, we put out a fleece. You know
[2:40:12] what? The Lord answered me just like
[2:40:14] that.
[2:40:16] And I thought, "We got to move, you
[2:40:18] know." And so, I told her and she says,
[2:40:20] "Well, that's what I've been trying to
[2:40:21] tell you." So, anyway,
[2:40:24] we sold my business. I asked the Lord. I
[2:40:27] sold it the next day. had the money that
[2:40:29] night. We had a huge truck, backed up,
[2:40:32] loaded everything in the truck heading
[2:40:34] west and didn't know where we was going.
[2:40:37] And there you got Now, you got to
[2:40:39] realize there was no churches
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; anywhere that believed this
[2:40:44] &gt;&gt; and we didn't know what we believed.
[2:40:47] I just knew that God had sent a prophet
[2:40:50] &gt;&gt; and I didn't really know what a prophet
[2:40:51] was. But later on after we got to
[2:40:54] California, I mean to Arizona, Phoenix
[2:40:56] there, we got in the power of
[2:40:59] transformation
[2:41:00] uh my we had a friend of mine that used
[2:41:03] to be my son's school teacher and he had
[2:41:05] started a church. He'd become a
[2:41:07] minister. He'd come to my house the
[2:41:08] night before this meeting, the power of
[2:41:10] transformation. You can listen to it.
[2:41:13] And um brother uh he come he started
[2:41:16] jumping on to me about the serpent seat.
[2:41:19] And I says I didn't know how to answer
[2:41:21] him. I just knew it was right. And he
[2:41:24] said, "Well, Eve said she had got a man
[2:41:26] from the Lord."
[2:41:28] And I says, "Well, I just know it's
[2:41:31] right. I don't know." And my wife said
[2:41:34] she's told me many of times and told me
[2:41:36] that night that she felt like a she just
[2:41:38] got real nervous and like a black cloud
[2:41:41] came down over. Well, we was at the
[2:41:43] Power Transformation. It was a
[2:41:45] breakfast. It was very long building,
[2:41:46] you know, probably 3,000 people or so.
[2:41:49] And we were sitting to the right of
[2:41:50] brother Brown like this. And brother
[2:41:53] Brown had an uncutting way that when you
[2:41:56] had a question, he could answer you in a
[2:41:59] crowd of people.
[2:42:01] &gt;&gt; You could not hide a thing from him. And
[2:42:04] I remember this. He about two twothirds
[2:42:06] through the min of the B through his
[2:42:09] sermon. Let me tell you this. He used to
[2:42:11] hold up a Bible like this. And I've seen
[2:42:14] him do it many of times. That's why I
[2:42:16] brought mine up here. And he says, "Now
[2:42:18] to know this," and me being Pentecost, I
[2:42:21] used to almost fall out of the chair. He
[2:42:23] said, "To know this is not eternal
[2:42:25] life."
[2:42:27] He says, "But to know the author
[2:42:31] &gt;&gt; is eternal life." And I'd go away from
[2:42:34] there and I think, "Oh, God,
[2:42:38] that's it." To know the author of the
[2:42:40] book.
[2:42:41] Well, as brother Brown uh was preaching,
[2:42:44] he turned like this and he he had a way
[2:42:46] that I don't know if any of you have
[2:42:49] heard much about it, but when he set his
[2:42:50] eyes, they were piercing. I couldn't
[2:42:54] even stand to look at him. And he went
[2:42:56] just like this where we were sitting and
[2:42:59] this minister friend was sitting right
[2:43:00] next to us. And he pointed just like
[2:43:02] this. Now he's preaching the power of
[2:43:04] transformation which is a totally
[2:43:06] different subject. And he says, "Now
[2:43:09] this about Eve saying that she's got a
[2:43:11] man from the Lord."
[2:43:15] Well, right then I realized he was
[2:43:18] sitting. I mean, I thought, "Well, he
[2:43:20] was sitting in our house the night
[2:43:22] before because he began to go in that
[2:43:24] and he talked for 10 minutes and my wife
[2:43:27] said just about the end of his talking,
[2:43:30] that cloud left off of her head." And
[2:43:33] brother Brown just goes right on back,
[2:43:35] dropped his hand, but he pointed the
[2:43:36] whole time. I I couldn't even look at
[2:43:38] him. I dropped my head. But he went
[2:43:40] right back and began to finish his
[2:43:42] sermon. The power of transformation.
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; But I tell you, you've seen something in
[2:43:47] this day. And what we need to do is is
[2:43:51] not just profess a Christian life,
[2:43:54] &gt;&gt; but we got to live it.
[2:43:56] &gt;&gt; And your very actions
[2:43:59] &gt;&gt; shows what's in here.
[2:44:02] &gt;&gt; We must live it. And it's not it's not a
[2:44:06] question of whether we want to or don't.
[2:44:08] If you don't, it's just what our
[2:44:10] brother's saying because the Lord has
[2:44:12] laid that upon my heart years ago. I
[2:44:15] determine I want to be a part of that
[2:44:17] rapture.
[2:44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:19] &gt;&gt; And I'm willing to lay down anything in
[2:44:21] my life
[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; if God will grant me the privilege to be
[2:44:26] one of those.
[2:44:36] We love him. He's alive, isn't he? Real.
[2:44:39] Brother Tom, would you come and dismiss
[2:44:41] us in prayer, please?
[2:44:45] Wonderful, wonderful Savior.
[2:44:48] Lord, we're so thankful for the moving
[2:44:50] of your word.
[2:44:53] Lord, as men of old were moved of the
[2:44:55] Holy Ghost, it was the breath of God
[2:44:57] that was inspiring them. So Lord, we're
[2:45:00] willing to hoist the sails of our own
[2:45:03] souls this morning and say, "Oh, moving
[2:45:06] of God, spirit of God, breathe upon us.
[2:45:09] Lord, move us into this glorious promise
[2:45:12] that we've anchored many years ago." And
[2:45:15] Lord, we got something beating within
[2:45:17] called a seed of representation.
[2:45:20] Lord, we don't want to learn it, but we
[2:45:23] want to see it by what is happening. So
[2:45:27] Lord, we've heard the word. were stirred
[2:45:30] now. Lord God, may we walk in it, Lord,
[2:45:32] desiring that our eyes will see your
[2:45:35] glory, Lord, that we would not miss the
[2:45:37] moving of God. Bless your servant. Bless
[2:45:40] your people. And may the spirit of God
[2:45:43] lead us into the perfect will of Christ.
[2:45:46] We love you and ask Lord you go with us
[2:45:49] now in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You are blessed.
[2:45:56] &gt;&gt; Hope you can hold it all.
[2:45:58] You're dismissed in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:46:01] Amen.
