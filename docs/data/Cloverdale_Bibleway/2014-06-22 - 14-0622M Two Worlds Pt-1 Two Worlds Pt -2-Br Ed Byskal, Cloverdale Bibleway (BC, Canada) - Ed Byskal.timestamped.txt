[14:37] prayer. [music]
[14:37] He also has a testimony he wanted to
[14:39] share with us.
[14:41] Brother Mike Gandandy has just asked
[14:42] that we please remember Sister Debbie.
[14:44] She is home with [music] problems in her
[14:46] back and hip. Asking that the Lord would
[14:49] grant her a healing touch this morning.
[14:51] [music] Brother John Dodd has a
[14:53] testimony.
[14:54] As many of you know, I've had an
[14:56] affliction with my swallowing for quite
[14:57] some time. And on Wednesday night after
[14:59] the service, I got something stuck in my
[15:01] throat. And after having a scope done at
[15:02] the hospital, they discovered that the
[15:04] mucus lining was torn.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; [music]
[15:06] &gt;&gt; After a lot of testing, they found out
[15:07] it would not require surgery. And praise
[15:08] God, I have been made whole. [music]
[15:10] Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you,
[15:12] brother John. Amen. Maybe the brothers
[15:14] could also just come and prepare for the
[15:16] morning offering at this time. And then
[15:18] immediately [music] after the offering,
[15:20] we will have the Sunday school come. So,
[15:22] if they could just be prepared.
[15:24] Amen. If there's something on your heart
[15:25] that you just like a touch from the Lord
[15:27] this morning, Amen. I just encourage you
[15:28] to reach out in faith as brother Ernie
[15:30] would come. Thank you, brother Ernie.
[15:31] [music]
[15:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's bow our heads for a
[15:35] moment of prayer.
[15:37] [music]
[15:40] Father, the words have [music]
[15:43] not been written or even imagined to say
[15:46] how blessed we are to be a a part of the
[15:50] elect of God.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; The elite [music] of God by the grace of
[15:54] God.
[15:56] And Lord, when your word came,
[15:59] the revelation [music]
[16:01] produced a a spiritual revolution in our
[16:05] lives. Has led to a supernatural
[16:09] restoration that's brought us all the
[16:11] way back to Eden, all the way back to
[16:13] what Adam and [music] Eve had available
[16:16] to them before the fall has been
[16:18] restored back to the bride. And we're so
[16:21] thankful and so so grateful for the
[16:24] blessings in your word. And each one of
[16:27] those words in the Bible are anointed
[16:30] [music] and the promises are are lying
[16:32] there waiting for us to believe them and
[16:34] confess them and possess them. Lord,
[16:38] [music]
[16:39] &gt;&gt; we're so thankful, Father, for your
[16:42] intervening touch when when one of us
[16:45] has a need and various various and
[16:49] sunundry needs in the body, Lord. But
[16:52] &gt;&gt; in your time, God is in time, on time
[16:54] all the time. [music] And Lord, for
[16:57] sister Debbie having trouble at home. We
[17:01] pray right now as I'm sure she's
[17:04] probably listening to the service. I
[17:06] pray that right now, Lord, that your
[17:07] Holy Spirit would reach down into the
[17:10] room where she is and touch her and make
[17:13] her every wit whole. Father, let her be
[17:16] able to stand up and rejoice and be able
[17:19] to testify
[17:20] that God is the same yesterday, today,
[17:23] and forever. And God has met her
[17:25] personally, an individual at her point
[17:28] of need. We thank you for the testimony
[17:30] that was given Lord for our brother that
[17:33] went to the hospital and uh after prayer
[17:36] all was well with him. [music]
[17:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Random said prayer is the most
[17:40] powerful weapon in the Christian's
[17:42] arsenal. We're so thankful Lord that
[17:45] that when we we pray that your line is
[17:47] is never busy that you can you can hear
[17:51] every request all the time 24 hours a
[17:54] day from from your bride all around the
[17:56] world.
[17:58] And brother Brandham said, "Don't ask
[18:00] God for little things. Ask him for great
[18:02] big things. Ask him for spiritual
[18:04] things, Lord." And today, we pray that
[18:06] you would move and and and Lord, if
[18:09] there are physical or financial or
[18:11] spiritual or emotional needs or
[18:13] decisions that are going to be made, we
[18:15] pray, Lord, that you would move and the
[18:17] right move would be made by each one,
[18:19] Lord, that has that need. Lord, we pray
[18:23] for the word that's going to be spoken
[18:25] this morning. We pray for a great
[18:27] liberty and a great anointing to come
[18:29] upon our pastor as he stands behind the
[18:32] sacred desk. Lord, just allow him to be
[18:34] able to deliver what God has put on his
[18:37] heart in a supernatural way. And let us
[18:40] receive it in a supernatural way. And
[18:42] let us receive the benefit, Lord, of
[18:45] what's going to be spoken to us. [music]
[18:48] We ask all these blessings in your
[18:50] precious and holy name of our Lord Jesus
[18:53] Christ. Amen.
[18:56] God bless you. You may be seated.
[18:59] I wanted to give a very very short
[19:01] testimony. Uh a while ago uh I was
[19:08] faced with a decision to move and uh I
[19:12] know moving is never fun for anybody and
[19:15] when you've been in a house for 15 years
[19:17] you accumulate a lot and uh you know
[19:20] when it comes to spiritual things or or
[19:22] business things I have accumulated you
[19:25] know just a ton of things and uh brother
[19:29] brother Martin Walman a deacon I I I
[19:32] just have to say he is a deacon above
[19:35] deacons. He's you know to me he's
[19:37] everything that a deacon should be and
[19:39] more. And I cannot put in words what a
[19:41] blessing he has been to me to come over.
[19:43] And he's a master organizer, put
[19:46] everything in order, where everything
[19:48] had to go. And I don't know how many
[19:50] trips that he has taken to the recycle
[19:53] bin with paper and boxes and uh
[19:56] recycling all the electronic equipment
[19:58] that was out of date that are boat
[20:00] anchors. And he just hauled everything
[20:03] everything away. It was here one minute,
[20:05] the next minute every everything was
[20:07] gone. And uh it was just it was it was
[20:09] like totally supernatural. And yesterday
[20:12] I wanted to do a move in two parts. And
[20:14] so brother Tim Andes, he put the word
[20:16] out on the uh the backyard ministry
[20:19] team. And I want to thank brother Tim
[20:21] for that wherever he is. And uh and
[20:24] brother Ron Cowwell was inspired to to
[20:27] have him add anybody who came and helped
[20:29] move. There was going to be a barbecue
[20:30] at his house. So, Brother Ron and Sister
[20:33] Star had a a great feast of a barbecue,
[20:36] and we had 14 young men show up at my
[20:40] house yesterday morning at 10:00. And I
[20:43] think it took us maybe uh maybe two
[20:45] hours to to take. And uh again, it it it
[20:49] seems so supernatural because there was
[20:51] just tons and tons and tons of furniture
[20:54] and boxes and uh books and Bibles and
[20:58] just enormous enormous amount of things.
[21:01] And I looked around and they said,
[21:03] "Where where do you want this, brother?
[21:04] Where do you want this? This is going
[21:05] this going. This go and all of a sudden
[21:07] everything was gone." And we're over at
[21:09] Brother Ron's house having a a barbecue.
[21:11] And it seemed like everything happened
[21:13] like like in a flash. And so, uh, you
[21:16] know, I just wanted you to know what's
[21:18] amongst us, that backyard ministry team.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; And, uh, I also wanted to thank a couple
[21:23] of of, uh, sisters that have helped.
[21:26] Sister, uh, Karen Hendrickson came over
[21:29] and, uh, she is a master packer. I I
[21:32] She's extraordinary. And, uh, and Sister
[21:36] Star Cwell came over and packed. Sister
[21:37] Ruth Frederick helped pack. And, Brother
[21:40] Diana uh, Walman uh, brought food over.
[21:44] and uh brother Richard Pettingale came
[21:46] over yesterday and brother Steve Rivas
[21:48] and all of his uh his boys. And so
[21:51] yesterday was I mean you want to talk
[21:53] about a 10,000 lb load lifted off your
[21:56] shoulders. I feel light as a feather
[21:58] today and I just want to thank God.
[22:02] [applause]
[22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to invite the Sunday
[22:10] school to come now. And maybe just as
[22:12] they come, why don't we sing thanks.
[22:13] Thanks. I give you thanks. And we want
[22:17] everyone's attention for a moment. The
[22:19] service tonight is going to be at 4:30.
[22:23] So, we're going to start the service
[22:24] immediately at 4:30 and give us a little
[22:25] bit of extra time for Lord's table this
[22:28] evening. So, everyone be here on time, a
[22:30] little early, and we'll get started

[28:13] [music] A boy named [singing] David

[28:19] he had God's help. Moses [music] set
[28:23] God's people free. [singing] He believed

[28:31] I [music] can. I can.
[28:37] I [music] can. I can.
[28:42] [music]

[29:43] [music]
[29:54] [music]
[30:01] &gt;&gt; [music]
[30:06] [applause]
[30:17] &gt;&gt; These guys never cease to amaze me ever.
[30:21] Um
[30:24] in John 15:5
[30:27] Jesus said, "I am the vine and ye are
[30:30] the branches and ye that abide he that
[30:32] abideth in me and I in him. The same
[30:35] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[30:38] you can do nothing."
[30:41] It's an interesting note that the vine
[30:44] produced the branch and the vine
[30:47] empowered that branch to produce fruit.
[30:51] And uh you know it says in Philippians
[30:53] 4:13, I can do all things through Christ
[30:57] which strengthens me. And I know brother
[30:59] Brandham, you know, he talks about when
[31:00] the bride of Christ ever realized who
[31:02] she was. And I think if we actually
[31:05] realize that um
[31:07] we're actually God wrapped in flesh, not
[31:09] some kind of little piece of flesh
[31:11] trying to house an almighty God, we'd be
[31:13] further down the road. And I just I it's
[31:17] an interesting song. Love the song.
[31:20] And yet there's we're still here. So
[31:22] there's obviously a seed somewhere out
[31:23] there that needs to be found. And and uh
[31:26] hence the reason for a missionary
[31:27] offering for the Sunday school. And uh
[31:30] if I can have sister Hannah Ray come,
[31:32] brother Bisll, have you come too? And um
[31:35] Brother Joseph, you can grab that box.
[31:50] Thank you. Thank you.
[31:54] And what is this?
[31:59] Now we need a muscle man to carry this.
[32:03] Thank you. Sunday school.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; God bless you. [applause]
[32:12] [applause]
[32:18] I always think it's so
[32:21] commendable
[32:23] that uh that the Sunday school has
[32:26] Sunday school superintendent who has
[32:28] always had the missions on his mind on
[32:31] his heart. God bless you,
[32:34] brother Richard, and for the all the
[32:37] teachers and for the students of Sunday
[32:41] school. Some of them are small, but just
[32:45] waited.
[32:46] Time goes by very quickly.

[33:55] and adored." And we'll just turn the
[33:56] service directly to the word.

[35:46] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful day.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; And I'm sure that all the all the school
[35:50] students can say praise the Lord for
[35:53] more than one reason. Now their classes
[35:56] are over. Isn't it wonderful?
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Ernie felt that 10,000
[36:02] pounds went off or tons, whatever it
[36:04] was. And uh I will feel better in
[36:07] another 2 or 3 hours. And
[36:10] and we'll all feel wonderful before this
[36:14] day is over.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; We'll say it's been good to be in the
[36:17] house of the Lord.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; It's been good to be at a communion and
[36:21] footwashing.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:24] Expect it, friends.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; Because you'll get what exactly what you
[36:28] expect.
[36:30] Uh and so at uh at 4:30 we're going to
[36:35] start promptly so that as we the saints
[36:38] from uh Seattle, Tacoma and so on will
[36:42] be able to get uh out just a little bit
[36:45] earlier and we're happy about that.
[36:48] Amen. Amen. Is everyone in expectation?
[36:54] &gt;&gt; All right. Well, I'll have you stand and
[36:57] we're going to just sing while

[37:06] he's doing, friends. [music]
[37:07] And I'd like to put you in
[37:12] not necessarily expectation, [music]

[37:48] that. Amen. So let's just sing it
[37:50] together.
[37:54] [music]
[37:55] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed
[37:59] that you love me.
[38:02] [music] I

[38:20] heart.
[38:24] [singing]
[38:25] [music]
[38:30] Now, we're going to sing it once again.
[38:32] I would like everyone [music] while
[38:34] people are getting settled, let's not
[38:36] bother looking around. Let's just focus
[38:39] on him. We're singing it to him. I'm
[38:42] amazed, Lord, [music] that you love me.
[38:44] I'm amazed that you sent such a perfect
[38:47] word, a bleeding word. Hallelujah.
[38:52] I'm amazed. [music]

[39:10] I [singing]
[39:14] [music]
[39:22] [music and singing]
[39:28] Heavenly Father, how true it is. Our
[39:32] hearts are filled with thanksgiving
[39:34] [music]
[39:35] and words cannot express what's in our
[39:38] hearts. Oh [music] God, we think that
[39:41] you picked us up out of the miry clay.
[39:43] You picked us up out of the filth of
[39:45] this world. You picked us up out of dark
[39:48] le oysia and with a glorious word you
[39:51] sent a message to us. Rise and shine.
[39:56] Your light has come. Oh God, I pray that
[39:59] the glorious light of the Holy Spirit
[40:02] will radiate out of every person. Oh
[40:05] God, I think of the uh those that have
[40:08] young children, those that are young
[40:10] parents, mothers are perhaps busy with
[40:13] their parents, with their children. But
[40:15] Lord, I pray that you will give them uh
[40:18] give them an opportunity to hear your
[40:20] word. And I pray you'll give the
[40:22] children not only an opportunity but a
[40:25] capacity to understand it. Oh God, let
[40:28] none be distracted. I pray, oh God, in
[40:31] the name of Jesus Christ, we give
[40:33] ourselves completely. I give myself holy
[40:35] over to you, Father, for this day is the
[40:38] Lord's day and it we will be glad and
[40:41] rejoice in it. God, your will be done.
[40:45] May your name be glorified as we seek to
[40:48] prepare ourselves for the crossing over
[40:51] time in the name of Jesus Christ, our
[40:54] beloved shepherd. Amen. [music] Amen.
[40:58] God bless you.
[41:01] I'll ask you to take your Bible and uh
[41:06] you can turn to John's gospel, the first
[41:09] chapter.
[41:11] But before we read, I'll just make a few
[41:14] comments just before we read the verses.
[41:18] We're going to start in verse 14 and
[41:20] read down to 18. And then I have two,
[41:23] three other verses we want to read.
[41:32] I'd like to just give a summary of the
[41:35] message. [clears throat] And I thought
[41:37] of all of those that have studied and
[41:39] students and the graduations uh
[41:42] ceremonies that have just taken place
[41:45] and how acquainted you are. So I
[41:48] [clears throat] thought of you while I
[41:49] was studying.
[41:53] I would like to include in this
[41:56] message and the message is going to go
[41:58] in a in a
[42:01] a very specific sequence
[42:04] sequence. So it will need your full
[42:07] attention. If you miss one of the
[42:10] sequences, it you'll kind of get lost.
[42:14] I want to speak on the origin of
[42:16] unbelief.
[42:18] The disobedience of course which is sin.
[42:22] The origin of it.
[42:26] Then how God created the element of time
[42:31] to destroy the works of Satan.
[42:35] Thirdly,
[42:37] but when the fullness of time was come,
[42:40] God sent forth his son made of a woman,
[42:44] made under the law.
[42:46] Fourth, for this purpose the son of God
[42:49] was manifested
[42:51] that he might destroy the works of the
[42:54] devil.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[42:55] &gt;&gt; And fifth, our
[42:58] includes all of us here. Our allotted
[43:02] time in this world to fulfill our part
[43:07] in God's plan
[43:10] to destroy
[43:12] the enemy.
[43:14] And if you'll think and of this out of
[43:16] the bosom of the father and I'll be
[43:19] going over these. Out of the bosom of
[43:21] the father came that that little mystic
[43:25] light that halo that he said we'll call
[43:28] it the son of god. Out of the bosom of
[43:31] the father came the son of god. But I
[43:34] want to put it in two concise terms. Out
[43:36] of the bosom of the father came
[43:40] redemption and destruction. Amen.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Both
[43:45] we will read,
[43:48] "And the word was made flesh and dwelt
[43:50] among us, and we beheld his glory, the
[43:53] glory as of the only begotten of the
[43:55] Father, full of grace and truth." John
[43:59] bare witness of him, and cried, saying,
[44:02] "This was he of whom I spake. He that
[44:05] cometh after me is preferred before me.
[44:08] He for he was before me and of his
[44:11] fullness have all we received and grace
[44:14] for grace. For the law was given by
[44:17] Moses but grace and truth came by Jesus
[44:21] Christ. No man hath seen God at any
[44:25] time. The only begotten son which is in
[44:28] the bosom of the father. He hath
[44:32] declared him.
[44:34] In the eth chapter, John 8:42. I'm just
[44:38] going to read one verse.
[44:45] John 8 and 42.
[44:48] Jesus said unto them, "If God were your
[44:52] father, you would love me. For I
[44:56] proceeded forth and came from God.
[44:59] Neither came I of myself, but he sent
[45:04] me.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; In the 13th chapter
[45:08] verse three,
[45:18] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[45:21] all things into his hands, that he was
[45:25] come from God and went to God. And the
[45:28] next verse and the next verses tell us
[45:31] how he gerted himself and washed the
[45:34] disciples feet. And tonight you will do
[45:37] that.
[45:39] But before he gerted himself, just
[45:41] before he girded himself,
[45:45] uh
[45:46] he said
[45:48] that knowing that God had given all
[45:51] things into his hands
[45:54] and knowing that he was come from God
[45:58] and went to God,
[46:00] &gt;&gt; he ged himself. So I think this evening,
[46:03] even if you prepare this morning for
[46:06] tonight when you get down
[46:10] to wash one another's feet, you'll also
[46:12] have that
[46:14] uh knowledge I came from God.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; And I go back to God
[46:20] &gt;&gt; and this is a brother. This is a sister.
[46:22] And I wash their feet.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a reality.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[46:33] I'm reading one more verse
[46:36] and you can just listen as I read it.
[46:38] It's 1 John 3:8.
[46:40] [clears throat] He that committh sin is
[46:43] of the devil. For the devil sinnth from
[46:45] the beginning.
[46:47] Then especially this line, for this
[46:51] purpose the son of God was manifested or
[46:56] for this purpose the son of God
[46:58] appeared.
[47:00] For this purpose the Son of God was made
[47:02] known. This is what we saw. For this
[47:05] purpose that he might destroy the works
[47:10] of the devil.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; And don't forget that the scripture says
[47:15] also that the great mystery that was
[47:18] unfolded is Christ
[47:21] in you.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; And for this purpose
[47:24] &gt;&gt; he was manifested.
[47:27] And I would like to extend that and say
[47:29] and for this purpose he's manifested in
[47:32] you
[47:34] &gt;&gt; that he might destroy the works of the
[47:36] devil.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; So I'll be coming to that and I think
[47:39] probably it might be quite a surprise to
[47:43] some. I am going to maybe we can just
[47:46] dim the lights a wee bit.
[47:49] I want to
[47:55] read these quotes together with you.
[48:11] I I have here the summary of the
[48:14] messages.
[48:16] But when the fullness of time was come
[48:18] as we're speaking about time and our
[48:21] allotted time in this world to fulfill
[48:24] our part in God's plan
[48:27] and then
[48:32] this great first battle that was ever
[48:35] fought began in heaven when Michael and
[48:38] his angels fought against Lucifer and
[48:40] his angels.
[48:42] It [clears throat] first start. It first
[48:44] started. The first battle was in heaven.
[48:46] So sin did not originate on the earth
[48:51] but in heaven.
[48:57] And then it was thrown down from
[49:00] [clears throat] heaven, cast out of
[49:01] heavens to the earth and fell on human
[49:05] beings. Then the battle from angels
[49:08] became human battles and Satan came to
[49:11] destroy God's creation. What God had
[49:14] created to be for himself. He had Satan
[49:19] came to destroy this. That's what his
[49:23] purpose was was to destroy it. Then the
[49:26] battle begin here on earth and begin in
[49:30] us and has been raging ever since.
[49:35] You can never evade that scripture
[49:38] &gt;&gt; that or or and I consider it as
[49:41] scripture not as the bi not from the
[49:45] Bible but it is a revelation of of the
[49:48] word of God. I hope you understand that
[49:52] and it has been raging. The reason I say
[49:54] it that way is because I do not know any
[49:57] believer where this has not been raging.
[50:01] Amen.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; This service is going to help many of
[50:04] you. [clears throat]
[50:17] Christ was manifested
[50:19] to destroy the works of the devil.
[50:22] [clears throat]
[50:23] And you believe that? Now, I can't
[50:25] explain all this. Christ was manifested
[50:28] to destroy the works of the devil. Is
[50:30] that right? You all believe that?
[50:34] &gt;&gt; What was he?
[50:36] God's word which destroys the works of
[50:39] the devil. Is is that right? He was done
[50:44] to do that. He was born to be that to
[50:47] destroy the works of the devil. Now his
[50:52] body is to do the same.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; We should say that together, please. Now
[50:58] his body is to do the same.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Because the body is head and body is
[51:06] together.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said it'll take this
[51:09] ministry to unite the two together.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; And that has happened.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; That's already happened, friend. Don't
[51:16] be left in the dust. That's already
[51:18] happened.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; It will take this ministry and the
[51:21] manifestation that was seen in the
[51:24] prophet's ministry. He said it would
[51:26] take the ministry exactly like the
[51:28] ministry of Jesus Christ to unite the
[51:31] head and the body together. And what is
[51:33] the purpose of the body? To destroy the
[51:36] works of the enemy.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Now his body is to do the same because
[51:42] the body is head and body is together.
[51:45] If Christ is the head was the word, his
[51:49] body has to be the same thing as his
[51:52] head was. A church of the word. Born of
[51:57] the word. Virgin born from the word. Not
[52:01] denominational now. Virgin born from the
[52:04] word. Let us say that last phrase.
[52:06] Virgin born from the word. Once again,
[52:09] virgin born from the word. Do you
[52:11] believe that? Virgin born from the word.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; That's the only kind the word produces.
[52:18] Virgin born from the word. Amen.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Now, I just have a few more
[52:27] here. [clears throat]
[52:31] Lucifer was kicked out and came to the
[52:34] earth. Then he polluted Eden. Then he's
[52:38] been polluting ever since.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; And now from the battle in heaven, it's
[52:43] coming to the battle on earth. And it is
[52:46] to be finished on earth
[52:50] &gt;&gt; at the end time in the battle of
[52:53] Armageddon.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; It's to be finished on earth. What
[52:58] battle? The battle between God and
[53:00] Satan. The battle between right and
[53:03] wrong. The battle between clean and
[53:05] unclean. The battle between truth and
[53:08] deception. It'll be finished, friends.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; We have that promise. You had that
[53:14] promise. It won't always be exactly what
[53:18] we're experiencing. It won't be that
[53:19] way.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; This is God's word.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; It'll be finished.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I want to take that back.
[53:32] [clears throat]
[53:34] Now, here I'm laying a real close
[53:37] foundation. So, he was first God. You've
[53:39] heard me read this before. So, he was
[53:42] first God. Jehovah, let's see coming out
[53:47] of space where there's nothing. Let's
[53:50] make a little white light like a mystic
[53:52] light, like a halo. And that was the
[53:56] logos that went out of God in the
[53:59] beginning. Now, let me just stop here
[54:01] and have you stop reading for a moment.
[54:04] To think that this may be well, I I
[54:07] can't quite understand that. Listen
[54:09] friends, the scientists go up with uh uh
[54:11] with a telescope and and and
[54:14] they show the planets and and the
[54:16] explosions off the sun and and all these
[54:19] glorious things in the heavens. You
[54:21] don't understand that.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; You don't understand just some gases.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; We don't understand some atomic powers
[54:29] or hydrogen powers or we don't know what
[54:32] kind of powers it is. And and and we
[54:35] don't understand the space. If we don't
[54:37] understand the millions of light years
[54:39] that all us if we don't understand that
[54:41] how we can understand um God appearing
[54:44] himself in a mystic light trying to come
[54:47] down so we can so we in this human
[54:51] condition think about it born from a
[54:55] woman
[54:56] &gt;&gt; by humans and we can understand God
[55:01] &gt;&gt; we can place God in time
[55:04] &gt;&gt; let's get real
[55:07] How can you get the one when we don't
[55:09] even understand what he created? How are
[55:11] we going to understand the creator?
[55:16] &gt;&gt; I think one of the things we need to
[55:18] under we don't want to misunderstand. We
[55:20] don't under underestimate our ignorance.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; We don't want to underestimate that. We
[55:30] we we're we're such finite beings and
[55:34] he's the infinite. Amen.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; So we'll continue to read for a
[55:38] [clears throat] moment.
[55:40] Like a halo and that was the logos that
[55:44] went out of God. And when we speak about
[55:46] logos,
[55:49] people get lost in it. But logos
[55:53] and don't close your mind now and think,
[55:55] well, I don't understand that. Yeah,
[55:56] you'll understand it. It's what a person
[55:58] intends,
[56:00] what God intended to do, and he spoke
[56:03] it. Yeah.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; And as I've asked the congregation, what
[56:06] language did he use? We don't know. What
[56:08] sound was it?
[56:09] &gt;&gt; We don't know that either. So a lot I
[56:12] think the what we don't know is a whole
[56:14] lot more than what we know.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; We just do not know exactly what that
[56:19] was. But the prophet said if he said let
[56:22] there be light and there came a fog,
[56:23] then it wasn't the word of God.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; There is light. We go out today. Thank
[56:28] God the sun's shining.
[56:31] So, we're thankful there was light. And
[56:33] we're going to come come to that in just
[56:35] a few moments. And the logos went out of
[56:40] God in the beginning. That was the son
[56:43] of God that came out of the bosom of the
[56:46] father. Now, now John the uh Baptist, he
[56:50] spoke that. That's what he said. He came
[56:52] out of the bosom of the father and the
[56:56] bosom. So, he had he he had some
[56:59] understanding. he was trying to convey
[57:01] to the people. And the bosom is is
[57:04] there's several words in the scripture
[57:06] that refer to the bosom, but the bosom
[57:08] to put it simply is from the intimate
[57:11] part.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ proceeded from the intimate
[57:16] part of God.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; The logos, the word, the intent, that in
[57:22] internal person,
[57:24] &gt;&gt; that internal being. That's why he had
[57:26] all the attributes of God. He was from
[57:29] the intimate part of God from the bosom
[57:32] of the father. There's only one came
[57:34] from the bosom of the father. And all
[57:36] that he was, he would pour into a body
[57:39] called a bride
[57:41] &gt;&gt; for himself.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Where do you think you came from?
[57:45] &gt;&gt; The bosom,
[57:47] &gt;&gt; the bosom of the father.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; As it came out of the bosom of the
[57:52] father. And that was what was in the
[57:55] beginning was the word. and the word was
[57:58] with God. So when we hear the word the
[58:00] word the word the word, don't don't
[58:02] forget that it's not just some syllables
[58:05] and something that's on in an alphabet.
[58:09] It's not that.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; It's something that God had within
[58:13] himself
[58:14] &gt;&gt; that he intended. And he had intended. I
[58:17] can tell you what he had intended in a
[58:20] few words. He intended to bring his
[58:22] children, the elected and the redeemable
[58:26] &gt;&gt; back to himself.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; What I had in my mind, I will bring back
[58:31] to myself.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; And the rest and the enemy, my arch
[58:35] enemy who rose against me with
[58:37] disobedience and with pride in his heart
[58:40] and with an iniquity in his heart. I
[58:43] have set in motion a plan and I'll
[58:46] destroy him
[58:48] &gt;&gt; and all angels that he took with him
[58:51] &gt;&gt; and all people who believe him.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; I will destroy it. It shall not be in
[58:56] existence anymore.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Glory. I don't want to go to any other
[59:03] place.
[59:08] And that was the word that was made
[59:10] flesh
[59:11] &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us.
[59:23] I'm going to just leave that now for a
[59:25] moment.
[59:30] coming into existence. He said a little
[59:32] white light and we'll call it like a
[59:35] halo. I'm not repeating, but this is
[59:38] from another message. And he says
[59:41] something just a little different. I
[59:42] want him. You can turn the lights on now
[59:45] if you wish, please. And that was the
[59:48] son of God,
[59:50] the logos,
[59:52] and went out of God in the beginning.
[59:54] And then
[59:56] and then that how that he was standing
[1:00:00] there. I want you to catch that phrase.
[1:00:02] He was standing there
[1:00:05] and he in his mind he be to think of
[1:00:09] what the world would be
[1:00:12] and drew all of this pictured in his
[1:00:14] mind and he said let there be light.
[1:00:20] So now we've moved to a very important
[1:00:23] station.
[1:00:25] time
[1:00:27] came into existence.
[1:00:31] You graduates
[1:00:33] that graduated,
[1:00:36] uh, I'll use you as an example, you've
[1:00:39] just said now 12 years is over and you
[1:00:41] get your cap and gown and so on so
[1:00:44] forth. And you were given these years
[1:00:48] time,
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; so much time
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; to study your books
[1:00:56] and do your assignments.
[1:01:00] And you had a certain amount of time to
[1:01:01] do your assignment. Hand that in.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Complete this. And then when you have
[1:01:07] completed this, you will write this
[1:01:10] examination that will show that you have
[1:01:13] studied this assignment and you have a
[1:01:15] certain amount of time and year after
[1:01:17] year after year and finally you come to
[1:01:20] graduation and you graduate. What is
[1:01:22] graduation? you it it's it simply
[1:01:26] demonstrates that these students who are
[1:01:29] sitting here seated seated here have
[1:01:32] completed this work
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; and they're not the same as when they
[1:01:36] entered in grade one.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; They have matured.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; They have learned. What have they
[1:01:42] learned? They learned what they were
[1:01:43] taught.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; You're sitting here learning.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; What are you learning? You're learning
[1:01:49] something of spiritual things. Amen.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; You're learning something that God by
[1:01:54] his holy spirit
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; and he everything that he can. He sends
[1:01:58] gifts and he sends men and he sends
[1:02:00] prophets and he sends Jesus Christ and
[1:02:03] he sends all of this so that humanity
[1:02:06] can hear so the world will be without
[1:02:08] excuse. And he will through that method.
[1:02:12] That means he will call every one of his
[1:02:15] elected
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; because he put a seed in them,
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; predestinated seed that's attracted to
[1:02:21] that.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; This is the voice I've been waiting to
[1:02:24] hear.
[1:02:26] And you that have been in school, some
[1:02:28] teachers are able to instructors are
[1:02:31] able to get more perhaps out of the
[1:02:33] student and certain ones seem to fit you
[1:02:36] and you can understand them and the way
[1:02:38] that they uh speak it. They're not
[1:02:41] preaching, but the way that they speak
[1:02:42] it and the way they teach and this is
[1:02:45] important,
[1:02:47] very important.
[1:02:49] Now, [clears throat]
[1:02:55] I would think that if you get that in
[1:02:58] your mind, I have to start. I have a
[1:03:01] beginning and I'm going to end. I I want
[1:03:04] to finish this project.
[1:03:07] Some of you that are in business or
[1:03:09] you've gone on to further education,
[1:03:12] you've gone and you you started
[1:03:14] something. You commenced it and you went
[1:03:17] through a series of of teaching or
[1:03:21] lessons or sermons or whatever more and
[1:03:23] then you come to an end and you said, "I
[1:03:27] I finished now what I've heard and
[1:03:29] learned in the book and what I've been
[1:03:31] instructed in." That's precisely God's
[1:03:34] program. Amen.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; We as humans have only borrowed it
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; for other purposes to learn to be a
[1:03:42] electrician or a plumber or a a
[1:03:45] financial advisor or something. We've
[1:03:47] learned that
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; girls learn from their mother. They
[1:03:51] learn certain uh tricks and the certain
[1:03:54] things in the kitchen. And so where do
[1:03:56] you learn that? I learned it from my
[1:03:57] mother. I I learned that from somebody.
[1:04:01] And that's exactly what we're we're here
[1:04:03] doing. And this is God's program now. He
[1:04:06] brought light into existence
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; to deal with sin.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; And he says that and he stood there
[1:04:16] and in his mind he be to think of what
[1:04:19] the world would be.
[1:04:23] And he drew all of this, pictured it out
[1:04:26] in his mind. This is the cruelty of sin
[1:04:28] and the penalty that it cost to rid sin
[1:04:30] from our lives. That's the message.
[1:04:34] and he pictured it in his mind and he
[1:04:38] said,
[1:04:40] "Let there be light."
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, "And God said,
[1:04:48] let them be for signs
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; and for seasons and for days and for
[1:04:55] years."
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; So God allotted his word from the very
[1:05:00] beginning.
[1:05:01] And then he said, "And why little
[1:05:03] Bethlehem?" He said, "God in every age
[1:05:06] allotted his word from the beginning."
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Truly, as we have a prophet,
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; one one is in 53 and the other's in 63.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Don't they fit together?
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; And he stood there and while he was
[1:05:22] standing, he said, "Let there be light."
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; He pictured the whole world and what it
[1:05:26] would be.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; He pictured every person. He knew he
[1:05:30] knew you. He knew exactly how you would
[1:05:32] get here.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; He knew your nature.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; He knew what part where to place you in
[1:05:39] the plan.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Just imagine if he placed a bunch of us
[1:05:43] back in the days of Jesus back in those
[1:05:45] days. No, it wasn't only the fullness of
[1:05:48] time for Jesus. It was the fullness of
[1:05:50] time for Caiaphas
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; and for the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
[1:05:56] You know why the Pharisees were sad or
[1:05:58] the Sadducees were sad? Because they
[1:06:01] didn't believe in the resurrection.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; So that's why they were so sad. You see,
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; if I didn't believe in the resurrection,
[1:06:10] I'd be a sad you see also.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; And so he said in 53, and so he said,
[1:06:21] "Let there be light." In 63 he refers
[1:06:24] and he says God in every age allotted
[1:06:26] his word from the beginning. He allotted
[1:06:29] a certain amount
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; of time.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; which he had created. He allotted a
[1:06:35] certain amount of time
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; to pass by when certain thing would
[1:06:40] start.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; And so when the fullness of time came,
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus came. He came. That was the
[1:06:48] fullness of time for him. When the
[1:06:50] fullness of time came for Mary, she gave
[1:06:53] birth, a virgin Mary gave birth to this
[1:06:56] to to a child, a son who was known as
[1:07:00] the son of God,
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; the son of man,
[1:07:04] the son of God. Allotted a certain
[1:07:07] amount of time, he created a a a record
[1:07:10] of the manifested thoughts of God.
[1:07:15] A record.
[1:07:17] And as those thoughts were manifested,
[1:07:21] God and I can't describe him, but God in
[1:07:24] his mind who drew all things out says,
[1:07:27] "I I'm manifesting the word now. I'm
[1:07:30] destroying more my enemy. I'm destroying
[1:07:33] him. I'm doing away with him." And he's
[1:07:36] coming in with more deception. I'm
[1:07:38] destroying it with truth. I'm
[1:07:40] manifesting truth.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; And truth and truth is light. And the
[1:07:46] light is keeping rising. The light is
[1:07:49] coming. The light is being shed abroad
[1:07:52] in the hearts of people. And I elected
[1:07:54] that this one would come. This one would
[1:07:57] come and these would come and these
[1:07:58] would come. And when the fullness of
[1:08:00] time came here, they sprung up.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; What for? To manifest the word. And the
[1:08:07] manifested word is here to destroy the
[1:08:10] works of the enemy.
[1:08:13] Don't ever let him bamboozle you that
[1:08:16] you have to cowtow to the enemy. You
[1:08:18] don't have to bend or bow to him. You
[1:08:21] certainly won't burn with him. God sent
[1:08:24] you here to be victorious over this
[1:08:27] enemy.
[1:08:29] Absolutely victorious. That's the whole
[1:08:32] purpose of the plan.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; He didn't send you here to be defeated.
[1:08:36] He didn't send you here to be despondent
[1:08:39] and discouraged. He sent you here to be
[1:08:41] victorious.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going to surprise some of you
[1:08:48] sometimes. I want to come to the end of
[1:08:50] this service. At towards the end, I want
[1:08:52] to speak of the power
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; of the lived out life.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Just a quiet lived out life.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; By living out
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; manifesting the character of Jesus
[1:09:06] Christ. You may not say a lot, but that
[1:09:09] is God's weapon
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; against the deception.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; The one who stands and is unmoved is the
[1:09:18] power of God against deception.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; The one who stands for truth, you don't
[1:09:24] have to say a lot. You don't have to be
[1:09:26] a preacher. You don't have to do a lot
[1:09:28] of things. You don't have to do any
[1:09:30] miracles. You live the life of God's
[1:09:33] life in you. And it defeats the enemy
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; at every junction.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; I declare it in the name of Jesus
[1:09:42] Christ. It defeats the enemy.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Whether you're in school or whether
[1:09:46] you're in university or whether you're
[1:09:48] at a workplace or whether you're in the
[1:09:51] shopping mall, all you have to do is
[1:09:54] live the life.
[1:09:56] And someone like Sammy Keane will come
[1:09:58] by and see your sister Reena Wit. And
[1:10:01] the power of God and sister Reena Whit
[1:10:04] when she didn't even know she was being
[1:10:07] looked upon, the power of God was
[1:10:10] defeating the kingdom of Satan in this
[1:10:13] other woman's life.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Let us rejoice.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't this glorious?
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; And down through the centuries of time,
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; God manifested his plan
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; through the lives of believers.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Students, you aren't the only ones who
[1:10:37] got a good report.
[1:10:40] And all these
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 12, Hebrews 11. And all these
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; having obtained a good report,
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; I would say they retain obtained a good
[1:10:52] report by the master teacher.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; The master of all.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; No professor ever even
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; came to know anything of the things that
[1:11:05] God
[1:11:06] knew as a as an instructor. And all
[1:11:08] these having obtained a good report
[1:11:10] through faith received not the promise.
[1:11:14] They didn't receive it in this life.
[1:11:16] They didn't get to see it,
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; but they believed in the promise
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; though we may not see it.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham lived to see the
[1:11:27] rapture and sister Glattis Dao told me
[1:11:32] she was sitting in the car in the back
[1:11:34] seat and she just said she's very
[1:11:36] forward. She said, "Brother Vandom, are
[1:11:38] you going to be here at the rapture?"
[1:11:40] And he said, "No, I'm going to be
[1:11:42] killed."
[1:11:43] Some kind of explosion. Said, "It might
[1:11:46] be a gunshot or something, but some kind
[1:11:49] of explosion. It was a car crash."
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; That was the kind of explosion.
[1:11:56] He said, "I wouldn't be here." But did
[1:11:58] he stop believing it?
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; One of his last messages is rapture.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; How to prepare for the rapture.
[1:12:06] Hallelujah.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; And we're children of faith.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; We pray for the sick. We believe they'll
[1:12:13] be healed.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; We pray for the diseased. We believe in
[1:12:17] miracles. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. Say,
[1:12:21] "Well, I haven't seen it." You believe
[1:12:23] and you shall see.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; That's the word of God. Amen.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; And when the fullness of time
[1:12:36] of come was come, God sent forth his
[1:12:40] sign. Now, God knew that was going to
[1:12:43] happen when he said, "Let there be
[1:12:45] light."
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; He knew that there would come a time, a
[1:12:50] time
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; because time had its commencement. Amen.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; How God who's eternal can't be put into
[1:12:58] time.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; He didn't. God didn't begin. Then
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; the light began
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; and light began to travel
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; and began to warm the planets and so on
[1:13:10] and so forth. It might have been
[1:13:12] hundreds of millions of years. We care
[1:13:14] not.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; That's not for us to figure out
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; because we couldn't understand it to
[1:13:19] begin with. And when the fullness of
[1:13:21] time was come, God sent forth his son
[1:13:24] made of a woman, made under the law.
[1:13:27] Galatians 4:4.
[1:13:37] And now he was made.
[1:13:41] And you saw this on this on the in the
[1:13:43] slide. Christ was manifested.
[1:13:47] His purpose of being made, his purpose
[1:13:49] of being sent was to destroy. Listen
[1:13:53] friends, not to somehow make our way
[1:13:56] through this world. That's not the
[1:13:58] program. The program is destroy the
[1:14:01] works of the enemy.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; He was manifested to destroy the works
[1:14:06] of the enemy.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you get this truth
[1:14:11] lodged in your heart, you'll realize all
[1:14:13] this other things and stuff you hear and
[1:14:16] things that you see will have no effect.
[1:14:19] It It's not that they will disappear.
[1:14:22] We're not looking for that. We're
[1:14:24] looking for for it to have no effect
[1:14:26] upon the believer. No effect whatsoever.
[1:14:29] In other words, like Mori did to Hmon.
[1:14:32] disregarded his existence,
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; disregarded his position,
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; disregarded his authority,
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; disregarded his so-called glory.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So disregarded. It was his
[1:14:46] disregard that ate out. And I can tell
[1:14:48] you that it is your disregard. Your
[1:14:51] disregard, I'm saying that in faith,
[1:14:54] your disregard of all of this stuff just
[1:14:56] gnaws on Satan.
[1:15:01] He just can't stand it.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; And he will take that position till he
[1:15:06] falls into the flame of fire.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; And Mori took that position until he
[1:15:13] hung on his own gallows.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Which he had intended for for I'm sorry,
[1:15:20] Hmon did, which he intended for Mori.
[1:15:23] Mordei didn't hang on the gallows.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Hmon hung on his own gallows.
[1:15:30] Hallelujah.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; He was born
[1:15:37] to be that
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. Say, "Well, he died. He He
[1:15:44] was crucified. He looked helpless. He
[1:15:47] was born to destroy the work of the
[1:15:49] enemy."
[1:15:51] And did he not destroy? Didn't he bring
[1:15:53] death out to an open defeat when he
[1:15:56] raised and said, "Here I am."
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Glory. Did he raise from the dead? Did
[1:16:02] he defeat death? Did he come forth as
[1:16:05] the conqueror? Yes. He was sent to
[1:16:08] destroy the works of the enemy. And his
[1:16:11] example of life, his example of
[1:16:14] response, his example of of his victory
[1:16:18] is our example.
[1:16:21] Amen.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; In the testimony of Jesus Christ, the
[1:16:30] prophet said he was risen from the dead,
[1:16:32] living in his church, and he said, "The
[1:16:34] things that I do shall you also greater
[1:16:37] than this shall you do because
[1:16:41] because I go to my father." Now, the
[1:16:44] people couldn't understand how him being
[1:16:46] a man would go to the father. and yet
[1:16:48] back in and and yet back in. But he
[1:16:52] said, "I come from God
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; and I go to God."
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; And he came he came out of spirit.
[1:16:59] Listen now. He came out of spirit or out
[1:17:02] of eternity
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; into time.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; He came out of eternity.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; He came out of another world
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; to this one
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; for one purpose, to destroy the work of
[1:17:15] the enemy. I don't want this message to
[1:17:18] ever be forgotten. If it's the last
[1:17:20] message I ever preach, I would want to
[1:17:22] preach on the defeat of Satan and the
[1:17:25] power of God.
[1:17:27] And this is why he came out of eternity,
[1:17:31] out of the great realms of eternity with
[1:17:34] one intent in mind, destroy the works of
[1:17:38] Satan.
[1:17:42] And I rejoice when I look upon the
[1:17:45] congregation of people and realize that
[1:17:47] the elect, the elect, he sent a word to
[1:17:51] call them out of this, out of this
[1:17:54] organization and out of this world
[1:17:57] council and out of all of these things
[1:17:59] and the elect have responded to it.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:18:08] He came out of eternity into time for
[1:18:11] the taking away of sin and he passed
[1:18:14] through time went back into eternity. So
[1:18:18] it was God
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; and he's with us
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; and he's with us. Now we're not supposed
[1:18:26] to break the intensity of what is being
[1:18:30] spoken. And he is with us. this one who
[1:18:33] sent his son and when the fullness of
[1:18:36] time came he was born of a in the
[1:18:38] simplicity
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; to a virgin.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; And he passed through time went back
[1:18:46] into eternity. So it was God and he's
[1:18:49] with us.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Raised from the dead. And the things
[1:18:53] that he did in the days of his flesh,
[1:18:55] he's doing tonight
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; and he's been doing since he rose from
[1:19:02] the dead.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Shall the prophet put it all back into
[1:19:05] time
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; all through those centuries. Do you
[1:19:08] believe it, friend?
[1:19:17] in seal of God.
[1:19:21] This is the sequence now. And he lived
[1:19:24] here on earth with us on earth in the
[1:19:27] form of a man.
[1:19:30] God lived in his son Christ Jesus as the
[1:19:34] God man.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; And he returned from glory leaving his
[1:19:39] word.
[1:19:40] A little while and the world will see me
[1:19:43] no more. Yet you will see me for I will
[1:19:47] be with you even in you.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; I will be with you even in you.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I don't really fully
[1:20:02] understand that." Do you understand him
[1:20:03] coming out of eternity?
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:20:07] we don't understand that either. So,
[1:20:09] let's just do our part and believe it.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Let's just repeat it
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; like brother Tom preaches. Put it on our
[1:20:17] lips. Put these words on your lips.
[1:20:30] to the end of the world.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; It had a beginning. It'll have an end.
[1:20:34] The person of the Holy Spirit, God
[1:20:37] returning in the form Jesus said, "I
[1:20:41] came from God. I go to God." He came out
[1:20:44] of eternity, stepped down into time,
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; went out of time, back into eternity.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; So now we're at that point at that
[1:20:54] junction
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; in the message fellowship. And when the
[1:20:58] sting of death, now we're just stepping
[1:21:01] back while he was in time.
[1:21:04] And when the sting of death was anchored
[1:21:06] in his flesh,
[1:21:08] that's why it had to be Calvary
[1:21:11] was anchored in the in the flesh of God,
[1:21:14] it pulled the stinger out.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; So today, we don't have any sting of
[1:21:21] death. Right.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; It can buzz
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; and make a sound, make a noise,
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; but we can stand like Paul that's under
[1:21:30] the fellowship.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, death,
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; where's your strength?
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we believe what has
[1:21:38] happened.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; You that are young and full of beauty
[1:21:44] and health and strength and all the rest
[1:21:46] of it.
[1:21:48] I can tell you that there's ones that
[1:21:50] are older and I can ask the older ones,
[1:21:52] where did the last 10 years go to?
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; How many would stand say I've said that?
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Well, we got one. How many more do we
[1:22:08] have? There we have. Look at this crowd
[1:22:11] of people.
[1:22:12] Look at this crowd of people. I'm
[1:22:14] standing here. We got honest people
[1:22:17] here. Have you never said that? The tip
[1:22:20] never never said that. He's a hero. I
[1:22:22] want to shake his hand.
[1:22:28] See this crowd of young people? They
[1:22:31] said, "Where did the last 10 years go?"
[1:22:33] All right, you can sit down. God bless
[1:22:35] you.
[1:22:37] And there's a whole bunch more that were
[1:22:38] too shy to stand.
[1:22:45] Oh, death, where's your staying? Oh
[1:22:47] grave, where's your victory? But thanks
[1:22:49] be to God that gives us the victory
[1:22:51] through our Lord Jesus Christ. There's
[1:22:54] where death was swallowed up in victory.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; At that at that seeler when the ladies
[1:23:02] that had, you know, they worked and they
[1:23:03] made their spices, they're just doing
[1:23:05] what ladies do.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; What are you doing today, dear? Well,
[1:23:09] I'm I'm making spices. You know, our our
[1:23:13] precious redeemer has been put in a
[1:23:16] tomb. He wasn't even in there.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; But they were making spices for somebody
[1:23:22] who wasn't there.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; What are they doing? They weren't They
[1:23:27] weren't fasting. They weren't having all
[1:23:28] night prayer meetings.
[1:23:31] They were just living their life.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; And in living their life and doing they
[1:23:36] got put into the eternal word of God
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; doing just what women do.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Just what women do. They prepare the
[1:23:44] spices and take and anoint the body
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; and they go there and they're the first
[1:23:49] ones. They see angels. They're in
[1:23:52] contact with another world.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; They're not even too sure. Even the men
[1:23:56] who heard the testimony, they're not too
[1:23:58] sure. They they saw some vision. They
[1:24:00] actually saw a man
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; who spoke to them
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; asking them, "Why do you seek the living
[1:24:07] amongst the dead?"
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Because they hadn't they hadn't heard it
[1:24:12] hadn't got to they hadn't internalized
[1:24:14] the words
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; that he'll rise again.
[1:24:22] And the bee lost his stinger. And the
[1:24:25] bee of death lost his stinger when it
[1:24:28] stung God Almighty. Manifested in flesh.
[1:24:31] Manifested in flesh.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; God is manifested in your flesh.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; God is manifested
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; in your flesh. I'm not saying that to
[1:24:42] try to get a response out of you. I'm
[1:24:44] saying that to get it into you.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; God is manifest in your flesh. Well, I
[1:24:50] don't see great things. He doesn't have
[1:24:52] to do great things. He'll do whatever he
[1:24:54] wants to do. You might just be a quiet
[1:24:56] person at at your place of employment,
[1:25:00] but that God manifested in you. You
[1:25:02] might just be someone I I've never
[1:25:05] actually been able to speak to any of my
[1:25:07] neighbors, but I can tell you one thing.
[1:25:10] They all know where we go.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; And I have a little standing joke with
[1:25:15] my wife. I said, I we drive out of this
[1:25:18] drive so often. I think that they think
[1:25:20] we're on a drug run.
[1:25:23] So I back out and they're we've only
[1:25:26] been in five minutes. We're backing out.
[1:25:27] I said there they're saying, "Oh, there
[1:25:29] they go again. Another drug run." I
[1:25:31] said, "The only thing they don't know is
[1:25:33] what kind of drugs we have." Hallelujah.
[1:25:37] We got the inoculation.
[1:25:39] We got the remedy. Hallelujah.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; And then the prophet says, now we're in
[1:25:50] 63. He says, "And I can see eternity
[1:25:54] break,
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; come down into time since Eden.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; I can see eternity break.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; This one who walked amongst us.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; This one whose tapes you hear,
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; I can see eternity break."
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; And come down into time since Eden. And
[1:26:17] when it did,
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; there come a line of blood
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; all the way up onto Calvary. And from
[1:26:25] Calvary, tied with this line and goes on
[1:26:29] to the tiepost, Jesus.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; And someday when he comes to claim his
[1:26:34] own, everyone that's tied to that
[1:26:38] ultimate,
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; I want to break here and say that is why
[1:26:41] this messenger had to say the bleeding
[1:26:44] word.
[1:26:46] That is why the message had to be
[1:26:47] crucified.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, don't be surprised that
[1:26:51] it had to be crucified
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; because it's the same one.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Each generation has to have their
[1:26:59] opportunity to hear the word and believe
[1:27:02] and disbelieve the word and be damned.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, I'm not going to be
[1:27:07] strong on those that believe without
[1:27:10] saying exactly what the scripture says
[1:27:12] about those that don't believe.
[1:27:15] Hallelujah.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Don't go soft on it now.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Is it the truth?
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; I'll let you finish it. And they
[1:27:27] believed a lie
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; and were.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Say it.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; You say it.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Does it say that?
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; I know people that don't want to believe
[1:27:38] that.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Precious Bible.
[1:27:44] But they might as well tear that page
[1:27:46] out
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; if they don't believe it. That's exactly
[1:27:48] what it says.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; I rejoice over it all.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; And someday when he comes to claim his
[1:27:57] own, everyone that's tied to that
[1:27:59] ultimate,
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; everyone that's tied to that ultimate.
[1:28:03] Only those. You're sitting here this
[1:28:05] morning listening. You must know that
[1:28:07] you are tied to that ultimate that this
[1:28:10] messenger is speaking. He was sent from
[1:28:13] God for this allotted season. Listen to
[1:28:16] it. For the rest of this service, you
[1:28:18] have an allotted time to believe what
[1:28:20] this messenger sent. I sent him out of
[1:28:23] eternity so that you would get a message
[1:28:26] and believe that message.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; And everyone that believes this ultimate
[1:28:32] will be raised up into eternity.
[1:28:40] Why? They have been in eternity all the
[1:28:44] time.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're in God's mind in in
[1:28:51] God's bosom in the intimate part of God.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; You think you're aching to get there.
[1:28:58] He's aching to have you.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; He's aching to have you. He made you
[1:29:02] what you are.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; He deposited in you what you have. so
[1:29:07] that he can receive you to himself.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; What a love story.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; For God so loved the world.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Not this chaos, not this violence,
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; not all of this inequality and
[1:29:21] injustices,
[1:29:23] not this filth.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; He loved the only one that's recorded in
[1:29:27] the scripture is when he had finished
[1:29:29] his creation and was completed.
[1:29:33] He said, "It's very good."
[1:29:36] That's the world he loved.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus, the son of God, stepped down
[1:29:46] into a period of time called the end
[1:29:49] time
[1:29:52] to manifest himself to fulfill Luke
[1:29:55] 17:30.
[1:29:57] There were some that hadn't been
[1:29:59] fulfilled.
[1:30:00] And your your prophet said, your
[1:30:03] messenger said to fulfill the rest what
[1:30:06] what's what's the all the stir about?
[1:30:11] What is what's this that's happening on
[1:30:13] the mountain? What what's this that's
[1:30:14] taking place?
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; What is it with these people? Why are
[1:30:18] they so fervent? Why are they so ardent?
[1:30:21] Why are they so have such a conviction
[1:30:23] about things? Why is it if they got to
[1:30:25] only understand, they cannot understand,
[1:30:27] can never see it, it's not me, it's him.
[1:30:30] living through
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; to defeat and destroy the works of the
[1:30:36] enemy.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; And so to manifest himself
[1:30:43] fulfilling Luke 17:30, that's why you've
[1:30:46] heard quite a few of the different
[1:30:48] ministers
[1:30:51] quote and repeat things that vindicated
[1:30:55] Brother Brandham's ministry.
[1:31:00] And during the time
[1:31:02] he's calling the nation, he blinded
[1:31:06] Israel.
[1:31:08] During this allotted time, during this
[1:31:10] specific time,
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; God sends a messenger.
[1:31:15] And during that time, someone was just
[1:31:18] at brother Randy and Sister Lorie
[1:31:20] Snow's. They have a book of
[1:31:24] uh someone has put together, brother,
[1:31:26] pardon.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Generous. generation
[1:31:29] and the shows of meetings in 1947 just
[1:31:32] masses of people
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; literally masses of people when you look
[1:31:37] at that
[1:31:39] when you see that I have it on my wall a
[1:31:41] few on my wall from Africa South Africa
[1:31:46] don't look at that and think you're
[1:31:47] looking at some history that's not
[1:31:50] history that's what God
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; did God sent him God called all his
[1:31:57] people allowed them to be uh uh allowed
[1:32:00] them to be stirred their emotions to be
[1:32:02] stirred and their spirit and soul to be
[1:32:04] stirred too some of them but allowed
[1:32:06] them to be stirred masses and you can
[1:32:08] say where are they alive in 47
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; quite a few here were alive in 47 during
[1:32:15] the 50s and here's all these masses of
[1:32:18] people
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; and during that same time during that
[1:32:25] same time it just seemed So uh such a
[1:32:28] paradox here here comes this uh after
[1:32:33] the aftermath of the second world war
[1:32:36] soldiers are returning home to America
[1:32:39] to Canada to the the UK Australia and
[1:32:44] different places different nations that
[1:32:46] contributed
[1:32:48] soldiers to the war. I've mentioned it
[1:32:50] here. This small country, Canada, only
[1:32:54] had less than I I don't know what they
[1:32:56] had in 1939,
[1:32:58] but they contributed 1 million over 1
[1:33:01] million fighting men to the Second World
[1:33:04] War. Was actually more per capita than
[1:33:07] any nation
[1:33:09] and fought some terrible, terrible
[1:33:11] battles and lost some of our best young
[1:33:13] men. A whole generation of young men
[1:33:15] were lost for the Second World War. And
[1:33:19] in and and in the aftermath. And then
[1:33:21] here comes the Holocaust.
[1:33:26] I have books I can't show you. I have
[1:33:28] pictures I can't show you.
[1:33:31] It's too gruesome.
[1:33:34] It's too terrible.
[1:33:36] Maniated bodies
[1:33:39] piled and stacked like cord wood.
[1:33:42] I have stood in the rooms where the
[1:33:45] ovens are
[1:33:47] and they burned them by the millions.
[1:33:51] And I walked and stood on the ground
[1:33:53] where the ashes are
[1:33:56] in Awitz
[1:33:58] and was at the 60th anniversary
[1:34:01] when the leaders of the world came and
[1:34:03] lit candles to say this must never
[1:34:05] happen again.
[1:34:08] No one ever said
[1:34:12] the tender hand of Jehovah.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; No one would dare say such a statement,
[1:34:20] the tender hand of Jehovah.
[1:34:23] I repeated those words to Gerson Solomon
[1:34:26] right over here
[1:34:28] at the Ramada in as we parked and his
[1:34:32] wife was at the door ready to go in. He
[1:34:35] said, "My wife has so much trouble. Why
[1:34:39] did God allow us to go through the
[1:34:41] Holocaust?"
[1:34:43] I said, "Our prophet called it the
[1:34:46] tender hand of Jehovah." And he just
[1:34:49] hung his head and looking down trying to
[1:34:53] assimilate those words. I said,
[1:34:56] "Anything less than this would not have
[1:34:59] driven your people back to Israel. And
[1:35:03] God cannot bless He said God cannot
[1:35:06] bless Israel outside of their promised
[1:35:09] land.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; And this Orthodox Jew said, "That's
[1:35:13] right.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; What is it?"
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Truth.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Truth.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Is a tender-handed Jehovah. Cuz almighty
[1:35:23] God knows he's going to give him white
[1:35:25] robes.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I tell you, the white
[1:35:28] robe means a lot more than a switch.
[1:35:31] means a lot more than the ovens. Means a
[1:35:33] lot more than the ashes of this earth.
[1:35:36] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're serving
[1:35:39] almighty God. And what was God doing? He
[1:35:41] was shaking his people out of all the
[1:35:44] nations according to his word. And I
[1:35:46] will bring you back.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; I will scatter you, but I will bring you
[1:35:51] back.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; And thus defeating, destroying the work
[1:35:58] of Satan.
[1:36:02] I hope you people can respond in faith
[1:36:06] and believing it in all truth, friends.
[1:36:08] And I hope all those that see it on the
[1:36:10] internet are grasping what is being
[1:36:12] done, what is being said, and where we
[1:36:14] are. We're not just in a service here
[1:36:17] having a church service this morning. We
[1:36:20] are here in a certain in a certain
[1:36:22] stage, a certain phase of this mighty
[1:36:25] last message that came. Hallelujah. And
[1:36:28] that is why the scripture says that he
[1:36:30] stood upon land and upon sea and said
[1:36:34] time shall be no more.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; And in the Greek or in the Hebrew in the
[1:36:40] Greek it says and there will be no
[1:36:42] further delay.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Delay to what? The revealing of him who
[1:36:48] was speaking. There be no further. I
[1:36:50] will come. I will manifest myself. I
[1:36:53] will appear. I will show myself. That's
[1:36:56] the pillar of fire in Houston, Texas.
[1:36:59] That's the pillar of fire in Germany.
[1:37:02] And thus all of these signs and we'll
[1:37:04] come to it in a few moments. It's God
[1:37:07] coming so close. And he's got a vessel
[1:37:09] so that he can materialize himself and
[1:37:12] come before the people so that the
[1:37:14] people will have no reason to doubt,
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; no reason to disbelieve.
[1:37:28] Hallelujah.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; In the days
[1:37:36] and he swear by him that liveth forever
[1:37:38] and ever who created heaven and things
[1:37:40] that are therein that therein are in the
[1:37:43] earth and the things that therein are in
[1:37:45] the sea and the things that are therein
[1:37:48] that there should be time no longer or
[1:37:50] there should be no further delay. I will
[1:37:52] not delay now these mysteries, these
[1:37:55] things that have been sealed. I will
[1:37:58] make them known.
[1:38:01] But in the days, the next verse,
[1:38:04] there'll be no further delay.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; For in the days,
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; that's the next verse.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; That's the next event.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; For in the days of the voice of the
[1:38:14] seventh angel.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; And people want to say, "Well, it's not
[1:38:17] him." Well, find him then.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Where is he?
[1:38:22] We have Israel back.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; We have all these other scriptures
[1:38:25] fulfilled. Where's this one?
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; I challenge the world. I challenge
[1:38:31] anyone. Show me this seventh angel.
[1:38:36] Show me this one that has the
[1:38:38] vindication.
[1:38:40] Show him to me.
[1:38:42] Denying one is the easy part. That's the
[1:38:45] parkbench politician that has all the
[1:38:48] can find everything that's wrong but has
[1:38:50] no answers.
[1:38:52] Finding things that are wrong are not
[1:38:55] answers.
[1:38:56] Anybody can find things that are wrong.
[1:38:59] Any hoodlm, anybody can find things that
[1:39:02] are wrong. Find the answer for me. Give
[1:39:05] me the answer. And I say on the
[1:39:07] authority of God's eternal word, we have
[1:39:10] found the answer. Or the answer found
[1:39:13] us.
[1:39:15] The answer found me.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; He found you.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; When you weren't looking for him, he
[1:39:26] found you.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:35] This verse simply declares
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; that there are words that are yet to be
[1:39:42] manifested.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture declares.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; There are words yet to be manifested.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; And you may be sitting here this morning
[1:39:50] and wondering, "What do I do?" You don't
[1:39:53] have to really do anything. Just
[1:39:55] believe.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; And when you believe, you will manifest.
[1:39:59] Somehow you will manifest it. It's not
[1:40:01] up to me to try to manifest it or up to
[1:40:03] you. We don't have to invent something
[1:40:06] new. God already has all the invention
[1:40:09] is here.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Will you believe it?
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; So when Christ is identified
[1:40:23] the same in all generations in 64 now
[1:40:26] we've moved. Hallelujah.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; In the beginning, that's when time
[1:40:30] started.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; When eternity broke down into time,
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; now after a while, time comes back into
[1:40:43] eternity.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; And he learned that in grades when he
[1:40:48] graduated out of grade seven in
[1:40:50] Kentucky.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; When did he learn that?
[1:40:57] Where did that come from?
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; That wasn't any professor at any
[1:41:01] university.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; They don't have that kind of knowledge.
[1:41:04] They don't have that kind of
[1:41:05] inspiration. They don't have that kind
[1:41:07] of insight. They haven't got that kind
[1:41:09] of connection. They weren't taught where
[1:41:11] he was taught.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; You have to forgive me. I'm just having
[1:41:19] a revival up here. I'm having a
[1:41:22] wonderful time. Amen.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; That's when time started. When eternity
[1:41:26] broke down into time. Now after a while,
[1:41:29] time comes back into eternity. Of
[1:41:31] course, time is eternity.
[1:41:36] Time is eternity too. He says, but time
[1:41:40] is aotted space.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; I hope you're not too tired now.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; I I I need a few more minutes. And
[1:41:48] that's the way the only thing we know is
[1:41:52] inches and yards
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; and miles
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; and figures and so forth. And all the
[1:42:00] students said
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; All the students said
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; I hear you yell at the ball court. All
[1:42:06] the students said
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:42:11] All we know is inches
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; and yards
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; and miles and figures and so forth.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; But that's that's nothing to God.
[1:42:21] [laughter]
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; He don't have no time.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; He's always
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; We know interest in yards and miles and
[1:42:32] figures and so on.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; But do you know somebody who's always?
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Figure that one out. You haven't got
[1:42:39] enough zeros.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; So a specific word I'm coming down
[1:42:48] to what I've been preaching for the
[1:42:50] whole purpose for
[1:42:52] the specific word or the thoughts of the
[1:42:55] predestinated will of God. What came out
[1:42:58] of the bosom? See I want you to see it.
[1:43:00] coming out of the bosom of God, out of
[1:43:02] his most intimate part
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; is coming this thoughts
[1:43:08] of the predetermined will of God
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; where to now be set in motion
[1:43:17] and God is revealed the prophet said in
[1:43:19] Christ is a revel revealed in his own
[1:43:21] word and God is revealed in every age by
[1:43:25] his promised word to that age.
[1:43:30] But when the fullness of time was come,
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; says God sent a son.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Listen folks, now when the fullness of
[1:43:38] time was come, God sent John the
[1:43:40] Baptist.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; When the fullness of time was come, God
[1:43:44] sent Saul of Tarsus.
[1:43:47] When the fullness of time was son,
[1:43:50] fullness of time was come, God sent
[1:43:52] William Brham.
[1:43:55] When the fullness of time was come,
[1:43:58] William Brham
[1:44:01] would could not fulfill his
[1:44:06] work of calling people out. If the
[1:44:09] calling people,
[1:44:11] so when the fullness of time this time
[1:44:14] came, God brought you forth.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; God brought you forth to hear it.
[1:44:22] And if we could get the testimonies
[1:44:24] throughout this audience today of how
[1:44:26] you heard it,
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; it was absolutely remarkable.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Just nothing short of supernatural.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; And I could keep you here the rest of
[1:44:37] the day until night telling you those
[1:44:41] things because I've lived with so many
[1:44:43] people that have had these experiences.
[1:44:49] And so God sent forth
[1:44:52] and when the fullness of time was come,
[1:44:54] God sent forth his son.
[1:44:57] I want you to go out of these doors
[1:44:59] today and at some point in time I want
[1:45:01] you to say these words.
[1:45:07] Your mother and dad can tell you when
[1:45:08] you were born.
[1:45:11] Said you were born in the evening. No,
[1:45:14] you were born just before midnight. You
[1:45:17] were born around noon. I want you to go
[1:45:20] out of this church today, please, and
[1:45:24] put the words of God out of his eternal
[1:45:26] word on your lips and say, "When the
[1:45:28] fullness of time was come, God sent me
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; into the earth." Amen.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; To hear a specific word, not in school,
[1:45:42] how to count,
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; not to learn your alphabet, not to learn
[1:45:46] your physics and your history
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; and all of these advanced things perhaps
[1:45:51] in advanced learning. That isn't why he
[1:45:54] sent you here. That's to help you get
[1:45:56] through this light. He sent you here to
[1:45:59] manifest a specific word because he
[1:46:02] intends you to play a part in his
[1:46:05] destruction because that what he puts in
[1:46:08] you is Christ. And Christ came into the
[1:46:11] world to destroy the works of the devil.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; And that part of Christ that you may
[1:46:18] have
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; is for that. And if you haven't received
[1:46:21] him yet, you need to receive him
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; if you're called.
[1:46:29] You know, there's nothing there.
[1:46:32] I'm very, very sorry.
[1:46:39] There needs to be something there. This
[1:46:41] prophet was honest enough to say also,
[1:46:44] "If you're not called, you'll never be
[1:46:47] there."
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; He was honest.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; I appreciate that. Amen.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; And it makes those that do have
[1:46:56] something
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; within them, you know,
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; I've been made
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; for a higher calling.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; I've been made for another world.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not at home in this world.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Uncleaness and sin has no part of me.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus could say, "Satan came,
[1:47:15] but he hath found nothing in me."
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Say it. He has nothing in me.
[1:47:21] Glory to God. Say it in the face of
[1:47:24] Satan.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Do we fail? Yes, we've failed. Have we
[1:47:29] sinned? We've all sinned and come short
[1:47:31] of the glory of God. Have we been
[1:47:33] forgiven? Yes, we've been forgiven. And
[1:47:35] more than that, we've been recreated by
[1:47:38] the new creation of Almighty God.
[1:47:42] Recreated. Virgin bride to Jesus Christ.
[1:47:47] Virgin born by the word of God. Do you
[1:47:49] believe that?
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; And God is his own interpreter. I'm
[1:48:00] going quickly now. Please help me.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; And now remember, you Christians were
[1:48:05] his thoughts.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Not you were in his thoughts. He said
[1:48:09] you were his thoughts
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; before there was a world.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Figure that one out.
[1:48:17] And you are the manifestation of his
[1:48:20] thinking.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; What was he thinking? His thinking was,
[1:48:25] I'm going to destroy this arc enemy. I'm
[1:48:28] going to destroy this betrayer. I'm
[1:48:31] going to destroy this deceiver. I'm
[1:48:33] going to destroy him.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Leave no trace of him.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, friends. The world
[1:48:41] passeth away.
[1:48:44] Yes.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; This world passes away.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; That world is coming into existence.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; That's my world.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; The unseen is my world.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Your world is a believer. That's our
[1:48:58] world.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:49:09] In other words, you're sitting here
[1:49:11] today and you're dressed in your Sunday
[1:49:15] suits and fineries.
[1:49:18] That's not why you were sent here.
[1:49:22] You were sent here to be the appearance,
[1:49:26] the demonstration of God.
[1:49:34] You'd be surprised what people say about
[1:49:35] you behind your back.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; I don't care what they say.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Procon, indifference,
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; liar, deceiver, whatever more doesn't
[1:49:48] make a bit of difference to me.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; I know what we are. I know who called
[1:49:52] me.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:58] I say hallelujah to my God.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Friends, I urge you to rejoice
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; in the salvation of
[1:50:10] what God has done. I en I urge you to
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; in the greatest battle.
[1:50:21] Let me follow quickly, please. And your
[1:50:24] spirit, are you too weary?
[1:50:27] And your spirit catches the word of God.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; And that's a thing that's got life in
[1:50:32] it.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; And your spirit catches the word of God.
[1:50:36] And that's the thing that has life in
[1:50:37] it.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Don't let that be here. Don't let that
[1:50:40] thing, the word of God, be here without
[1:50:43] catching the life in it.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to see a tribulation,
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; but it is coming.
[1:50:58] The world, the world is being set up
[1:51:00] right now.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; The pain and suffering
[1:51:09] that is taking place is indescribable.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; We're not here to try and talk about it,
[1:51:16] but it is indescribable. Your own human
[1:51:18] body, one single body
[1:51:24] can suffer pain
[1:51:26] and you have more pain
[1:51:29] and then they give you pain pills and
[1:51:31] then are you with me?
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; And then you reach a level where the
[1:51:36] medication doesn't work
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; and you're filled with pain and then if
[1:51:40] that pain increases
[1:51:43] you will actually go into
[1:51:44] unconsciousness.
[1:51:47] That's one body. Now just take the
[1:51:50] masses in the millions.
[1:51:52] And the pain's not only in the body.
[1:51:54] What about pain?
[1:51:56] What about the millions of children
[1:51:58] right now? Children,
[1:52:00] they're coming up from Mexico in the
[1:52:02] United States. They've come from El
[1:52:04] Salvador and they've come from all kinds
[1:52:05] from Central America. They're pouring
[1:52:07] across and the United States government
[1:52:10] doesn't know what to do. They're
[1:52:11] sleeping in big auditoriums right in
[1:52:14] Texas.
[1:52:17] on cold cement. They don't know what to
[1:52:20] do with them.
[1:52:22] Can't put children in jail. 9 years old,
[1:52:24] 10 years old, 11 years old. How much
[1:52:27] pain
[1:52:30] are those kids having?
[1:52:32] How much pain is in the world? How much
[1:52:35] pain is in Africa right now? How much
[1:52:37] pain is in Ukraine?
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; How much pain is in Syria?
[1:52:44] Right.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; How much pain
[1:52:49] and then the world finally
[1:52:52] it crumbles under the intensity of these
[1:52:55] wars and this hatred and this fighting.
[1:52:58] Do you want to be here?
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Is this is this your world?
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; For someone that doesn't want to go, I
[1:53:10] just say have a happy tribulation.
[1:53:14] You made your bed, sleep in it.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; And even if I didn't have a tingle of
[1:53:20] God in a service like this, I would say,
[1:53:22] "Oh, God."
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; I would call out, "I wouldn't care who's
[1:53:26] beside me.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't care who's in the
[1:53:28] congregation. Oh, God, remember me."
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; You think the thief on the cross was
[1:53:34] thinking about who's beside him or who
[1:53:37] cared what he said? He didn't care. He
[1:53:40] didn't care about the mockers. He didn't
[1:53:41] care about him. losing his garment to
[1:53:44] the people that were uh uh
[1:53:48] passing their what were they doing?
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Casting lots for his garment. He didn't
[1:53:53] care about anybody. Lord, remember me.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; When you come into your kingdom,
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; what an answer.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; What an answer to a man who lived a life
[1:54:05] of treachery.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Perhaps killed people. I don't know what
[1:54:09] he was. robber, a man of sin. Lord,
[1:54:13] remember me. And to hear the word today,
[1:54:16] today you'll be with me in paradise.
[1:54:21] What was that worth? That's worth all
[1:54:23] the shame and all the mockery and all
[1:54:25] the ridicule anybody else. You think he
[1:54:28] cared what anybody said? Nobody cared.
[1:54:30] He didn't care. He had one who cared
[1:54:33] today.
[1:54:42] Frankly, I don't care what anybody
[1:54:44] thinks.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; I want to hear two words.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; I want to hear two words.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; From that one who said today,
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; and by God's grace, I trust I will be
[1:54:57] able to hear them.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; And I do not take it for granted. You
[1:55:01] say, "What are those two words? I want
[1:55:02] to hear well done.
[1:55:05] That's all I want to hear.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Well done.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; I think of the woman that poured the
[1:55:12] ointment on him and they the disciples
[1:55:15] and the apostles and everybody were iate
[1:55:17] over it. What a waste.
[1:55:19] And he said, "Don't trouble the woman.
[1:55:23] She has done this for my burial."
[1:55:26] Burial. They didn't know anything about
[1:55:28] burial. Even though he told him burial,
[1:55:33] he said she hath done what she could.
[1:55:36] And I've made that a phrase for my life.
[1:55:40] I say that often. All I want to hear is
[1:55:43] you you did what you could.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; Can you give me just a few more minutes,
[1:55:53] please? In this atmosphere, I just want
[1:55:55] to finish just a very few minutes.
[1:56:05] This will set.
[1:56:07] Can I get that slide one more please?
[1:56:13] Don't read it ahead of me.
[1:56:19] Then we become a part of him
[1:56:23] as you are the veil that veils him. I
[1:56:26] want to stop there and have you look
[1:56:27] this way.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; You're the veil.
[1:56:32] You know what you are? I'll put in
[1:56:34] today's language. You're undercover
[1:56:36] agents
[1:56:38] of the Holy Ghost. They've never figured
[1:56:41] me out. They've never figured you out
[1:56:44] because God has veiled you. And people
[1:56:47] are trying to figure out, you know, what
[1:56:49] makes him tick, what makes her tick,
[1:56:51] what makes him that way, what makes him
[1:56:54] dress this way or what makes them
[1:56:56] whatever.
[1:57:00] We sat in an airport
[1:57:03] for several hours
[1:57:05] determined to get on a South African
[1:57:07] airlines from one of the islands of the
[1:57:10] sea. I think it was Canary Islands,
[1:57:13] wasn't it? there off there someplace
[1:57:15] around the Canary Islands
[1:57:18] and in come this we waited four days and
[1:57:21] in came this big jet 747 South African
[1:57:25] Airlines
[1:57:27] landed
[1:57:30] there was a long space maybe from here
[1:57:32] to the door across the big open area of
[1:57:36] this air airport and there was a family
[1:57:38] came in after we were there and they
[1:57:40] were sitting on the other side they had
[1:57:42] three teenage children and a husband and
[1:57:44] wife and they were all busy and I was
[1:57:46] and we were waiting. There was nobody at
[1:57:48] the counters. So, we're waiting as soon
[1:57:50] as the girls got to the counter. I mean,
[1:57:52] I saw I was just watching cuz I'm
[1:57:54] nervous that way, you know, and I see a
[1:57:57] South African air airline girl coming up
[1:57:59] and I just up made a beline right for
[1:58:01] the desk. And I'm standing there at the
[1:58:04] desk like this. Some of you have heard
[1:58:05] this before, but it's very appropriate
[1:58:07] now. I'm standing at the desk and this
[1:58:09] woman, she made a beline also for the
[1:58:11] same counter and she's standing right
[1:58:13] beside me on this side and I could feel
[1:58:15] her pushing on my elbow. But you push
[1:58:18] all you want. I'm staying right here
[1:58:23] and she just pushed a little harder and
[1:58:26] a little harder and uh you know what few
[1:58:29] minutes later she was standing in front
[1:58:32] and I was off to the side
[1:58:35] and she just started she ranted on. She
[1:58:37] said, "We've been here. We've been We
[1:58:39] were put off of our flight. We've been
[1:58:40] waiting here and sitting in the motel or
[1:58:43] hotel and all of these cost everything
[1:58:45] else. We've got to be on this flight."
[1:58:49] And uh I knew the plane was loaded. So
[1:58:52] when we got to the I'll make this short.
[1:58:55] When we got to the waiting room, I got
[1:58:59] up there too and the 747 has a hump at
[1:59:02] the top and the first class is up there.
[1:59:05] some first class.
[1:59:07] So, uh,
[1:59:10] and my wife and I, we got, we were just
[1:59:12] two people and we got up in that hump.
[1:59:17] Don't don't don't don't feel that some
[1:59:19] something special. It was just packed
[1:59:21] with people
[1:59:23] and uh, just as we were coming up, we
[1:59:25] were right beside the same family coming
[1:59:27] up and they all had regular seats. But
[1:59:31] there was one first class seat and she
[1:59:33] says, "Oh, let me I've never been
[1:59:35] there." She said to the rest of her
[1:59:36] family, even three of her kids. And so
[1:59:39] she took the first class ticket and we
[1:59:41] all walked onto the plane all crowded.
[1:59:44] And then we go up that little spiral
[1:59:46] staircase up to the top. And man, she
[1:59:48] was up there and here's two nice easy
[1:59:50] seats right there facing each other, you
[1:59:52] know, swivel seats. And and I and my
[1:59:54] wife sat in one and I was just ready to
[1:59:56] dive in the other. And this woman dived
[1:59:58] in ahead of me and left me standing
[2:00:01] there and I thought, "Boy, she'd be
[2:00:03] beating me all the way along."
[2:00:06] So, I went and sat somewhere else. I
[2:00:08] thought about another eight hours of
[2:00:10] flying
[2:00:12] and I can't visit with my wife. So, I
[2:00:13] went and sat somewhere else and it was
[2:00:16] just packed with people.
[2:00:19] And uh I I got up and went to the
[2:00:21] washroom.
[2:00:23] And uh this woman said to my wife said,
[2:00:26] "What does your husband do?"
[2:00:30] She said, "He's a minister."
[2:00:33] She said, "Oh, I've been watching you
[2:00:36] all the time. We were in the airport.
[2:00:38] I was looking across that space and I
[2:00:40] was looking at you and she said,
[2:00:44] "Your face,"
[2:00:47] he said, "you're so clean." I don't mean
[2:00:50] that you've just washed. said, "There's
[2:00:53] something. I've been trying to figure
[2:00:54] out what it is."
[2:00:57] Just think of it, friends.
[2:00:59] There I I had it in my heart. I'm going
[2:01:01] to get to that counter first.
[2:01:05] She had it in her heart. I'm going to
[2:01:06] get But if she's sitting there trying to
[2:01:08] figure something out, you know what
[2:01:09] she's trying to do? She's trying to see
[2:01:11] behind the veil.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Say, "What makes this cleanness?
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; What makes this woman this way?" My wife
[2:01:18] wasn't preaching. She wasn't praying.
[2:01:20] She wasn't reading a message book. She
[2:01:21] wasn't doing anything. She was just
[2:01:22] sitting there being a believer
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; preaching a message to this woman
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; and was able to direct her to message
[2:01:33] believers in South Africa. We don't know
[2:01:36] what happened but we did our part.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; You've been sent here
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; in this aotted time
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; to manifest a certain portion of word
[2:01:47] God has given you. Do you hear me? I'm
[2:01:50] not preaching a sermon. I'm giving you
[2:01:51] an announcement. God has given you a
[2:01:53] specific amount of word. All you have to
[2:01:56] do is believe the word that God has sent
[2:01:58] you. He will do the manifesting. He will
[2:02:01] manifest it in silence. He'll manifest
[2:02:03] it in music. He'll manifest it in word.
[2:02:06] He'll manifest it in preaching. Somehow
[2:02:09] he will manifest his word because it is
[2:02:13] him who's destroying the works of the
[2:02:15] devil.
[2:02:18] Hallelujah.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; That's my message to you today, friends.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; I feel that's what God has sent me to
[2:02:27] this pulpit to do. Tell you you're here
[2:02:30] and this message is your allotted
[2:02:32] portion
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; and the devil tries to come and take it
[2:02:36] away from us or tries to lessen it,
[2:02:39] tries to tell us it's not true. I deny
[2:02:42] that.
[2:02:44] I challenge him in the name of Jesus
[2:02:47] Christ. That enemy will be destroyed
[2:02:50] even for his thoughts in this way.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Go and tell him who spoke to the people.
[2:03:02] You live in a certain place
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; and you have you're praying for a
[2:03:06] certain person. It's your sister. No,
[2:03:08] it's not your sister. It's your
[2:03:10] sister-in-law.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Tell this kind of thing. Tell the person
[2:03:14] who gave that wisdom
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; that these things aren't so.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; And I want to say they are so,
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; they are true.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; I want to declare it openly. You
[2:03:24] declared with your praise and
[2:03:26] thanksgiving to God. Thank you, Father,
[2:03:29] for having called me at this specific
[2:03:32] time. And I know you're faithful. You
[2:03:36] have allotted a certain word and just
[2:03:38] help me to live that. I give myself to
[2:03:41] the Holy Spirit. I will be a I will be a
[2:03:44] veil for the living God.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Oh beloved
[2:03:54] Lord Jesus.
[2:03:56] We are so grateful, so thankful.
[2:04:00] I want to give you praise and thanks
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; for the congregation, for the people,
[2:04:05] for those that are streaming,
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; and those that may hear this at this
[2:04:10] time that of our rejoicing
[2:04:13] and this announcement of this is where
[2:04:15] we're at. Bless the people that have
[2:04:18] come up from Seattle or Victoria or
[2:04:21] wherever they are and those that have
[2:04:23] traveled to come here. They've waited in
[2:04:26] lines perhaps at the border. The
[2:04:28] children that came early. Lord, bless
[2:04:30] the children. Bless those that stood
[2:04:33] here. Oh God, bless our young men and
[2:04:36] young ladies.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Within the school system, whether it be
[2:04:40] this school system, we thank you,
[2:04:42] Father. I see Brother Tatch here and his
[2:04:45] wife, Sister Shelly. Thank you, oh God,
[2:04:47] for star people. And I pray that you
[2:04:50] will embolden them, Father. And the
[2:04:53] teaching staff, oh God, the ministry
[2:04:56] that stands here, Father, and we hear
[2:04:59] them have spoken as Brother John spoke
[2:05:02] to the students, oh God. And I pray for
[2:05:05] those that are in the university, Lord,
[2:05:08] at SFU and wherever they may be, and in
[2:05:11] the further education, oh God, may they
[2:05:14] know this is only education to help them
[2:05:16] through this life. But we have another
[2:05:19] focus. We have another focus. We have
[2:05:22] another world. And this world is not my
[2:05:25] home. I'm just a passing through. My
[2:05:29] treasures are laid up somewhere
[2:05:32] somewhere beyond the blue. We do not
[2:05:34] know where it is, but we know that it is
[2:05:36] nigh to us. Thank you for this message
[2:05:39] and messenger. Oh God, that passed into
[2:05:42] their realm. I'd like to say to this
[2:05:45] congregation in prayer, Father, this
[2:05:48] messenger that you sent, you allowed him
[2:05:50] to pass into that world that we're
[2:05:54] headed to. You gave us a taste. You gave
[2:05:58] us a foretaste like no other people of
[2:06:00] history
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; because you gave it to the generation.
[2:06:04] This is our allotted portion.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; This is our allotted inheritance.
[2:06:11] And in the name of the holy one of
[2:06:13] Israel, the Lord Jesus Christ, I claim
[2:06:18] that. Oh God, may every believer, oh
[2:06:21] father, I pray that their spiritual life
[2:06:23] will be enhanced and there will be
[2:06:26] invigorated.
[2:06:27] I pray, oh God, there will be a
[2:06:29] cleansing wave for everyone that may be
[2:06:31] a sinner and unbeliever. Remove that
[2:06:34] unbelief even now. Oh God,
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; may it startle them how quickly it
[2:06:38] leaves them. And let them have a heart
[2:06:41] of faith and belief in the name of Jesus
[2:06:44] Christ for your glory.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; For your glory.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; This world is not my home.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
