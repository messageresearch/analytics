[1:32] Want
[1:47] to welcome everyone this morning to the
[1:48] house of God.
[1:52] This is a day when most of the world's
[1:54] going to be out shopping. I think
[1:57] everybody rushing around the last minute
[2:00] because the most important thing to them
[2:03] is
[2:04] Christmas presents, right? Don't want to
[2:08] disappoint anyone.
[2:11] I trust you've received, Brother
[2:12] Brandham said, the ultimate Christmas
[2:14] gift, which is Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:18] And uh I want to sing a couple of uh old
[2:22] Christmas carols this morning. These are
[2:23] songs and I remember sitting and I had
[2:26] paid much attention as a kid to
[2:28] Christmas carols. We kind of sang them
[2:29] at Christmas time and I remember just uh
[2:32] not long after we had some of the we had
[2:35] uh I think Jake went into school. It was
[2:37] in elementary school. We went in there
[2:40] for some little Christmas concert they
[2:41] had and they started singing one of the
[2:43] Christmas carols and I started reading
[2:45] the words. Wow, these words are good.
[2:48] Everybody in here is hearing the gospel
[2:50] whether they realize it or not. they
[2:52] were hearing the gospel. So, some of
[2:54] these songs we only sing once a year,
[2:56] but uh maybe uh there's nothing wrong
[2:59] with that. And uh well, sometimes my
[3:01] kids, you know, they just uh get uh
[3:04] Christmas always being a wonderful
[3:05] family time for us. And sometimes I'd
[3:08] walk in in the middle of July and hear
[3:09] Christmas carols going on in the house.
[3:12] Says some of these songs got great
[3:13] words. So, let's stand this morning and
[3:15] we'll sing uh number 792 on the screen.
[3:20] Amen.
[3:24] We're worshiping the Lord this morning.
[3:27] Amen. Do you love him? Praise God.

[14:44] your presence, Lord. God, we have
[14:46] gathered this resurrection morning to
[14:48] lift up that name above all names, the
[14:51] lovely name of Jesus Christ. Father,
[14:56] angels worship you. But Father, we're
[14:59] the redeemed. We are the bloodbought.
[15:02] We're the purchased of God. We are the
[15:04] ones that were picked up from the muk
[15:07] and mire of this world. There was a hand
[15:09] that reached down. There was a hand that
[15:12] brought us forth, washed us in the blood
[15:15] of the lamb. And we're thankful for
[15:17] that. We're asking that you will come
[15:19] forth out of your word and speak to us.
[15:23] Lord, deliver those that need
[15:25] delivering. Save those
[15:27] that need this great salvation.
[15:31] Father, touch those that need a touch
[15:34] from the master's hand. And so, Lord, as
[15:37] we've gathered, may our worship be true.
[15:39] And may it be from our hearts. And may
[15:41] you be praised. May you dwell amongst
[15:44] now the praise of your people. Bless
[15:47] brother Ed as he will bring the word.
[15:49] and let that word do its molding work
[15:52] within our lives. May we cradle the
[15:54] Christ again and may we make an entrance
[15:57] within our hearts and may you be pleased
[16:00] to come and dwell and suck with us this
[16:02] morning in Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[16:09] and you can have your seats this
[16:11] morning.
[16:18] We're happy to have each and every one
[16:20] of you here this morning. And if you're
[16:22] visiting here, we're just uh we just

[19:42] [Music]
[20:20] [Music]
[20:38] longing for a savior,
[20:42] a hopeless world would wait.
[20:47] Sin demanded justice
[20:51] at a price we could not pay.
[20:55] But God displayed his mercy.
[20:59] The greatest gift of love.
[21:04] When we could not reach heaven,
[21:08] heaven came to us.
[21:14] He made a way in a manger.
[21:19] Away through the star
[21:22] [Music]
[21:24] of the promise
[21:27] before time had beun
[21:31] for God so love this world.
[21:35] But we knew what love would fall
[21:40] away in a manger.
[21:46] to make a way to the cross.
[22:05] In Bethlehem a stable
[22:09] became a throne of grace.
[22:13] As God himself our savior
[22:16] drew near to take our place.
[22:21] His mother smiled in wonder.
[22:25] The shepherd stood in awe.
[22:29] The sacrifice of heaven
[22:33] lay sleeping in the stone.
[22:38] He made a way
[22:41] of danger
[22:43] away through the sun.
[22:47] The sign of the promise
[22:51] before time had beun
[22:54] [Music]
[22:55] for us to love this world.
[22:59] Though we knew what love would want, we
[23:03] made a way in a manger
[23:09] to make a way to
[23:14] [Music]
[23:16] he
[23:19] got our death.
[23:22] [Music]
[23:23] The precious Lord Jesus
[23:29] lay down his sweet
[23:32] [Music]
[23:36] away in a manger. No crib for a bed.
[23:45] The little Lord Jesus laid down his
[23:51] sweet head.
[23:54] [Music]
[23:56] The stars in the bright sky looked down
[24:01] where he lay.
[24:06] The little Lord Jesus
[24:10] asleep
[24:12] on the head.
[24:17] He made a way in a manger.
[24:22] Away through the sun
[24:27] of the promise
[24:30] before time
[24:35] of this world.
[24:38] But he knew what would
[24:41] [Music]
[24:44] he
[24:45] in
[24:48] [Music]
[24:50] to make a way to the cross.
[24:56] He made a way in a manger
[25:02] to make a way to the cross.
[25:07] Oh,
[25:08] [Music]
[25:23] heat.
[25:27] [Applause]
[25:37] Thank you very much children. It's
[25:39] wonderful.
[25:42] Get tired of hearing the kids sing and
[25:45] it gets even more interesting when
[25:48] some of
[25:51] our attributes are up there. Right,
[25:52] brother Tom?
[25:55] It's a bit strange. Um,
[26:00] still haven't quite gotten used to it.
[26:04] Amen. Uh, there's a note here. Bible way
[26:07] Christian Academy students will be
[26:09] singing tonight. Parents, please have
[26:11] your children in the fellowship room at
[26:13] 4:45 tonight before the service.
[26:17] Um, the senior choir is going to come up
[26:19] as soon as the uh
[26:23] smaller ones have taken their seats. Um,
[26:26] they're going to sing a a song that I've
[26:29] asked them to sing this morning that uh
[26:31] been going over my mind for the last
[26:32] three or four days and I've I've got up
[26:35] uh I know this morning, yesterday
[26:38] morning and this song was just going
[26:39] over my head and uh you know, brother
[26:42] Brandon said today Christian means a
[26:44] carton of camels, a bottle of serum
[26:47] wrapped up in pretty Santa Claus paper,
[26:49] but they still refuse God's Christmas
[26:51] gift. They still refuse his Christmas
[26:54] gift. They don't want it.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; But he said, "I want it.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I received it."
[27:02] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I wonder tonight in this
[27:03] building, in this Christmas time, in
[27:05] commemoration of nearly 2,000 years ago,
[27:08] when God gave the first Christmas gift,
[27:10] I wonder tonight if you'd look, like to
[27:13] look on the inside of that package and
[27:16] see, sinner, that there isn't somebody
[27:18] in there who loves you. Somebody who
[27:20] died for you, somebody who gave their
[27:23] life for you. Would you be willing
[27:24] tonight to take the swaddling's cloth
[27:27] off of him, that dirty cloth that they
[27:29] call fanatic and holy roller, wrap
[27:31] yourself up in it, and take the way with
[27:34] the Lord's despised few. Amen.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; He's all I want this morning, saints.
[27:39] So, if the senior choir could come,
[27:41] they're going to sing this uh song.
[27:44] And that's
[27:47] certainly my cry of my heart this
[27:49] morning. I know it is and it should be
[27:51] everyone here. I trust we can worship
[27:53] the Lord together as they sing this
[27:55] song. You're all I want, Lord. You're
[27:56] all I need. Amen. We want to worship him
[27:59] in the spirit of truth. Amen. We believe
[28:02] that he's here this morning. Amen. To
[28:04] receive that worship. Amen. We want to
[28:06] prepare our hearts this morning to
[28:08] receive the word of God so that when our
[28:10] pastor comes to speak, Amen. The seed
[28:12] will fall on a prepared ground. Amen.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:41] [Music]
[29:05] Have you really thought how wonderful is
[29:09] our Lord Jesus Christ?
[29:13] He redeemed us by his precious blood. We
[29:17] are his purchase
[29:20] price.
[29:21] For I know what I was
[29:26] and I know where he took me from.
[29:30] We were sinners bound in chains. Lord,
[29:34] we didn't know we had your name.
[29:40] We thank you Lord
[29:45] Jesus.
[29:48] We thank you Lord
[29:54] Jesus.
[29:56] You're all
[29:58] I want.
[30:01] Heavenly Father,
[30:04] you're all
[30:06] that I need.
[30:12] Lord, we worship you
[30:15] in the beauty of holiness.
[30:19] For what your word has done for us,
[30:23] we hide it in our hearts. We will not
[30:28] let the enemy
[30:31] steal it away.
[30:36] You're all
[30:38] I want.
[30:41] Heavenly Father,
[30:44] you're all I want.
[30:54] You are the great kinsman, redeemer,
[30:59] the mighty one of wealth.
[31:03] In whose sight we have found grace.
[31:07] We know you will not rest until you
[31:12] finish the work
[31:15] that you've begun in us.
[31:21] We are your bride.
[31:26] Jesus.
[31:29] We are your
[31:32] [Applause]
[31:34] Lord. You're all I want.

[39:09] hallelujah. Let's worship him. Saints,
[39:12] you're all that we want, Lord. You're
[39:15] all that we need, oh God. Oh, we worship
[39:19] you, Lord. Lord, you are worthy of our
[39:22] praise this morning, Lord. Hallelujah.
[39:26] Glory to your name. Hallelujah.
[39:29] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[39:34] [Music]
[39:42] Hallelujah.
[39:47] [Music]
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:54] That's our purpose of being here today.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; When shepherds arrived, they worshiped
[40:01] him.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Sometime later, when the wise men
[40:04] arrived, they worshiped him.
[40:07] Sometime later, the disciples arrived
[40:10] and they worshiped him.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; And all down through the ages,
[40:16] those who love him worship him.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; And we are here today for that one
[40:20] purpose, to worship him, to give him
[40:24] honor.
[40:26] Amen.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; You came into the world a sinner so he
[40:30] could save you. So you could worship
[40:31] him.
[40:33] We were born in sin, shaped in
[40:35] iniquities,
[40:37] &gt;&gt; but God saved us so we could worship
[40:39] him.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; I think we should say in fact is we
[40:44] wouldn't be able to worship him unless
[40:46] he'd sent the Holy Spirit within us. So
[40:48] we can worship him in spirit and in
[40:51] &gt;&gt; truth.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Truth.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Many worship in spirit, spirit only.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; But it's in spirit and truth.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the father desires to
[41:03] worship him. Perhaps we could just sing
[41:05] that together. We worship you in spirit
[41:08] and in truth. And uh
[41:12] we're happy to have each of you here,
[41:14] those that are visiting. Nice to see
[41:16] you, Brother Chris. God bless you. Amen.
[41:20] One thing about having Brother Chris,
[41:24] you don't miss him very easy. And when
[41:26] he sits on the front seat, you don't
[41:28] miss him at all. Hallelujah. God bless
[41:31] him. Nice to have you all here.
[41:35] Are you happy to be here?
[41:38] Praise the Lord. We're having a
[41:40] wonderful time. Amen. Before we sing
[41:43] this, I want to give a special
[41:45] acknowledgement to our brother and
[41:47] sister Henry Hayes Senior and his wife.
[41:52] They had 61 years of of marriage as of
[41:56] yesterday. That was their anniversary
[41:58] yesterday.
[42:00] Amen.
[42:01] [Music]
[42:05] [Applause]
[42:06] [Music]
[42:07] [Applause]
[42:13] That's the grace of God.
[42:16] Amen. I tell you today 61 years is a
[42:20] real milestone.
[42:23] Amen. God bless them.
[42:25] All right, let's just sing it together.
[42:32] We worship you
[42:37] in spirit.
[42:38] [Music]
[42:45] We worship you.
[42:56] [Music]
[43:00] your word and your presence.
[43:07] [Music]
[43:10] We worship you.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; We've heard your word.
[43:21] We've heard
[43:24] your word and found your presence.
[43:29] [Music]
[43:33] We worship you
[43:38] in spirit
[43:40] and in truth.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Our dear heavenly father, we have come
[43:49] and gathered together
[43:51] with a one single purpose in our minds
[43:55] that we might worship you. We want to
[43:58] worship you in spirit and in truth. We
[44:01] want to worship you in such a way that
[44:03] it will be acceptable and received by
[44:06] you. We do not want uh just idle words
[44:10] on our lips but out of the very depths
[44:13] of our soul. We want something of
[44:16] reality, Lord, to rise up to give you
[44:20] thanks that we can be here today in the
[44:23] land of the living in this golden age
[44:26] that your prophet spoke about. Oh God,
[44:30] you have given us such a privilege to e
[44:34] to express and to make known this Christ
[44:38] which has come which has been given to
[44:40] the world. And we think of the revealing
[44:44] of Jesus Christ in this hour. We think
[44:46] of the fulfillment of Luke 17, the 30th
[44:50] verse. Lord, even thus will it be when
[44:53] the Son of Man is revealed. And here you
[44:56] are, Lord, in bride form in your
[45:00] children by your spirit and by your
[45:03] word. Take your word now, I pray. anoint
[45:07] us mightily by the Holy Ghost that we
[45:10] can Lord hear it that it will be a
[45:13] reality to us and so made so real. Burn
[45:18] it, inscribe it, Lord, with your finger
[45:20] upon the tablets of our heart. I pray
[45:23] father you'll bless all wherever they
[45:26] may be throughout this planet Father
[45:29] throughout the earth Lord wherever
[45:31] people are streaming and through the
[45:34] technology that you've allowed Lord that
[45:36] we can join together hearttoheart and
[45:38] attribute to attribute not only within
[45:41] this building but wherever your body of
[45:44] Christ is today pray you'll anoint us
[45:47] Lord anoint me to bring your thoughts to
[45:50] the people in the name of Jesus Christ.
[45:53] Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[45:59] I'll invite you to turn in your Bibles
[46:01] to uh the book of Luke, the 2 chapter,
[46:10] and we're going to begin reading at
[46:12] verse 21.
[46:29] And when eight days were accomplished
[46:31] for the circumcision circumcising of the
[46:35] child, his name was called Jesus, which
[46:39] was so named of the angel before he was
[46:42] conceived in the womb. Isn't it
[46:44] wonderful that the first time the name
[46:47] was mentioned, it was came out of the
[46:50] lips of an angel from the presence of
[46:52] God.
[46:54] And when the days of her purification
[46:58] according to the law of Moses were
[47:00] accomplished, they brought him to
[47:02] Jerusalem to present him to the Lord. As
[47:06] it is written in the law of the Lord,
[47:08] every male that openeth the womb shall
[47:10] be called holy to the Lord. and to offer
[47:13] a sacrifice according to that which is
[47:15] said in the law of the Lord, a pair of
[47:19] turtle doves or two young pigeons. And
[47:22] behold, there was a man in Jerusalem
[47:24] whose name was Simeon.
[47:26] And the same man was just and devout,
[47:30] waiting for the consolation of Israel,
[47:32] and the Holy Ghost was upon him. And it
[47:35] was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost
[47:38] that he should not see death before he
[47:41] had seen the Lord's Christ. And he came
[47:44] by the Spirit into the temple. And when
[47:47] the parents brought in the child Jesus
[47:50] to do for him after the custom of the
[47:53] law, then took he him in his arms, and
[47:58] blessed God, and said, Lord, now let us
[48:02] thy thou thy servant depart in peace,
[48:06] according to thy word. For mine eyes
[48:09] have seen thy salvation,
[48:11] which thou hast prepared before the face
[48:14] of all people, a light to lighten the
[48:18] Gentiles and the glory of thy people
[48:22] Israel. I'd like you to notice the 32nd
[48:25] verse.
[48:28] I light to lighten the Gentiles
[48:31] and the glory of thy people Israel. If
[48:34] you would turn also back to Matthew's uh
[48:38] gospel the fourth chapter
[48:41] uh I'd like to just read it just a very
[48:43] few verses starting with verse 13.
[48:51] And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt
[48:54] in Capernaum, which is upon the sea
[48:57] coast, in the border of Zabulon and
[49:00] Nephilim,
[49:02] that it might be fulfilled which was
[49:05] spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
[49:08] "The land of Zabulon
[49:10] and the land of Nephilim, by the way of
[49:13] the sea beyond Jordan, Galilee of the
[49:17] Gentiles, the people which sat in
[49:20] darkness saw saw great light. And to
[49:23] them which sat in the region and shadow
[49:25] of death, light is sprung up. And from
[49:29] that time Jesus began to preach and to
[49:32] say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven
[49:36] is at hand." God bless you. As you have
[49:39] your seats,
[49:48] I've taken a a title to the message this
[49:52] morning
[49:54] from the uh 32nd verse in our first
[49:59] reading,
[50:01] a light to lighten the Gentiles.
[50:04] And that is the title of the message
[50:06] this morning, a light to lighten the
[50:10] Gentiles.
[50:14] The
[50:16] uh the word light
[50:18] of course is very uh common to us
[50:22] and uh I find that in the scriptures
[50:26] God has allowed the scriptures to be
[50:29] written in the Old Testament in the
[50:32] Hebrew and the New Testament in the
[50:33] Greek which we've received and God even
[50:36] knows you know how it was to be conveyed
[50:39] to us. But I find that certain words uh
[50:43] which we read and and it will have a
[50:46] specific meaning to us as individuals in
[50:49] in our uh English language. It and it
[50:53] may have exactly the same meaning in the
[50:56] in the Hebrew or the Greek. But as you
[51:00] look at the word and find out how it was
[51:02] used throughout the scripture, you'll
[51:04] find that it has a much broader
[51:08] uh meaning.
[51:09] much much a deeper meaning than we would
[51:13] normally have in our in our mental
[51:15] understanding of the word. And I believe
[51:18] that even God, he knew exactly how he
[51:21] wanted a certain thought conveyed. And I
[51:24] believe it's important for us as
[51:26] ministers to be able to convey the full
[51:29] depth of that thought. And so it says
[51:32] that uh now in the in the Old Testament
[51:35] for example when it's used the word
[51:38] light because the scripture in in Isaiah
[51:43] and it's one that uh brother Brandham
[51:45] used in the message shalom and I will be
[51:48] using some quotes out of that message
[51:50] today. It was his uh Thanksgiving or New
[51:53] Year's uh service I would say for 1964.
[51:57] And uh the scripture there is arise and
[52:00] shine for thy light, thy light is come
[52:03] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[52:06] thee. And the light in the Hebrew is
[52:09] simply it's aura which we use the word
[52:12] we we know what aura is. It's a it's a
[52:15] light that's around a person. And uh but
[52:18] in the Hebrew when it says thy light has
[52:20] come it is the light of life or the
[52:24] light of prosperity
[52:27] uh the light of instruction
[52:30] the light of someone's face that someone
[52:33] looks upon you and uh they look
[52:36] favorably upon you the light of
[52:39] someone's face or the light of Jehovah
[52:43] uh God as being Israel's light. So when
[52:46] I refer to the aura, your light has
[52:49] come. The light of blessing, the light
[52:51] of prosperity, the light of instruction,
[52:54] the light of the countenance of God, who
[52:57] is the light of Israel. Uh all of that
[53:00] is what they understood when that single
[53:02] word was used. When we talk about light,
[53:05] you know, a lot of our children today
[53:07] and so on may think of the light and the
[53:09] light switch and the the bulb in the
[53:11] ceiling, but that's not what we want to
[53:14] be thinking about. We want to be
[53:16] thinking of it in terms that God God
[53:19] spoke it so we can get his his thought.
[53:22] And uh in the message shalom
[53:27] uh brother Brandon makes this reference
[53:30] and and there's three things here that I
[53:32] need to uh inject at this moment so we
[53:36] can have you follow my thought through
[53:39] the service. said, "We're facing here
[53:43] uh uh we're facing here in our two
[53:46] subjects." That was the scripture which
[53:49] they read uh arise and shine for thy
[53:52] light has come and the glory of the Lord
[53:54] has risen upon thee. The second verse is
[53:58] verse two of Isaiah 60 6 is for behold
[54:03] darkness shall cover the earth and gross
[54:07] darkness the people but the Lord shall
[54:10] arise upon thee and his glory shall be
[54:14] seen upon thee. And so that's why
[54:17] brother Brandham uses and says there's
[54:19] two subjects here in the scripture. Uh a
[54:23] very contrast one to the other and arise
[54:27] and shine for the glory is upon thee.
[54:31] And the next verse gross darkness is
[54:33] upon the people. And then when we are in
[54:37] a mixtury, now it's not an English word
[54:40] that we use, but we it's amazing how
[54:43] brother Brandham used words and we knew
[54:45] exactly what he meant. Even though you
[54:47] can't find it in the dictionary, he know
[54:49] you know precisely what he's talking
[54:51] about. And so he says and and when we
[54:54] are in a mixtury of light and darkness
[54:57] and that's exactly what we have. We have
[55:00] light here but darkness is coming to
[55:02] another part of the world at the same
[55:04] time. And somewhere between that we have
[55:07] maybe dawn or evening and dusk coming
[55:10] because it's a mixtury of the two uh
[55:13] between the light and the darkness. It
[55:16] says we have a mixtury. And then my
[55:18] address to the church is shalom or peace
[55:22] to the church. And yet there was
[55:24] darkness, gross darkness upon the
[55:27] people.
[55:28] Now I want to come to the uh uh to the
[55:33] uh he the English as compared to the
[55:37] Greek uh in the light and I'm just
[55:40] taking a little bit of time to to kind
[55:42] of lay this foundation for you because
[55:45] in the scripture which we have uh read
[55:49] uh
[55:52] a light to lighten
[55:55] the I want to bring those two words a
[55:57] light to lighten. And the light in the
[56:01] Hebrew and in the Greek are slightly
[56:04] slightly different. But in the New
[56:06] Testament, we have God is light and in
[56:10] him is no darkness at all. Then Jesus
[56:13] said, I am the light of the world and he
[56:17] that followeth me shall not walk in
[56:19] darkness. And then Jesus said, you are
[56:22] the light of the world. So it says God
[56:25] is light. said Jesus said I am the light
[56:29] and Jesus said you are the light
[56:34] &gt;&gt; and this word light is light of truth
[56:39] the light of knowledge
[56:42] together with spiritual purity.
[56:46] light as the power of understanding
[56:50] especially
[56:52] moral spiritual truth
[56:56] and that word light comes from a a
[57:00] second word in the in the uh Greek which
[57:04] is and this is important
[57:07] it is for something to appear
[57:10] so if it's in darkness you can't see it
[57:13] but if light comes it's not just that
[57:16] let there be light and and there's
[57:18] light. No, the purpose of God was that
[57:20] light would come so that something else
[57:23] can appear so that something else can
[57:26] come into view. And so it the word light
[57:30] which is foss what we have in the he in
[57:33] the Greek phosphorus. And so that is
[57:35] where where we get the word light. But
[57:37] then it comes from this uh pheno which
[57:41] is to appear or god intends light so
[57:44] something can be seen or to bring forth
[57:47] into the light so that it can be
[57:50] understood.
[57:52] It is to cause something to shine so it
[57:56] can become evident.
[57:58] He wants it to become evident. Something
[58:01] that can meet the eyes or strike the
[58:04] eyes or something that he wants to make
[58:08] manifest so it can be made uh not just
[58:12] evident but that you can get some
[58:14] understanding from it. You understand?
[58:17] Because actually what God wants you to
[58:19] understand is his purpose of bringing he
[58:23] brings light causes something to appear
[58:27] because he wants you to understand by
[58:29] what's appearing what his purpose what
[58:32] his motive and what his uh uh what what
[58:36] is in his thoughts. He wants to convey
[58:38] something and that's the whole that's
[58:41] the whole purpose. Is this making sense
[58:43] to you? Amen.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; So, it's not just, oh, light. Oh,
[58:46] there's a light. No, that's not it. When
[58:48] the Bible speaks about light, it is so
[58:51] that so that something can uh be light
[58:54] can shine upon something to bring it
[58:57] into view to bring it into manifestation
[59:00] so that when you see it, it it
[59:03] enlightens you and that's why it says a
[59:05] light to enlighten because I want to
[59:08] also go into the into the word to
[59:10] enlighten, but it's to bring it
[59:13] and and and there's one more Greek word
[59:17] that so there's two compound words with
[59:19] the light and the last one is it's to
[59:23] say or to speak
[59:26] to affirm or to declare
[59:29] and make known one's thoughts. So now
[59:34] here we have what the what the light is
[59:38] to make known. It's not just to bring
[59:40] something to make it evident to make it
[59:44] visible but it is to convey to the
[59:47] people and God's purpose is to make
[59:50] known and declare his thoughts. And now
[59:55] you have this is a light to lighten the
[59:59] Gentiles. And the word lighten is much
[1:00:02] much deeper than just light itself. a
[1:00:06] light to lighten the Gentiles. And the
[1:00:09] word lighten
[1:00:12] uh is is a it's used in the Bible in
[1:00:15] this in this way. But here's the actual
[1:00:18] direct meaning. It is a revelation.
[1:00:22] Something to be revealed.
[1:00:24] It's manifestation.
[1:00:27] It is also a person coming. Person
[1:00:31] coming into your presence. That person
[1:00:33] is appearing. that has to do with
[1:00:36] lighten because uh someone coming into
[1:00:39] your presence coming to you uh right
[1:00:43] away. I mean I know it's going to
[1:00:45] conjure up some thoughts to say this
[1:00:47] person's approaching me why are they
[1:00:49] approaching me? What what is the
[1:00:50] purpose? What are they going to say? Uh
[1:00:52] you know what is this event that's
[1:00:54] taking place? And so it can have to do
[1:00:57] with coming or appearing. It is a a
[1:01:01] disclosure of truth, instruction
[1:01:04] concerning things that before were
[1:01:07] unknown.
[1:01:09] It is used of events of which things or
[1:01:14] uh or persons hitherto withdrawn from
[1:01:17] view are made visible by a manifestation
[1:01:21] or by an appearance. And it is to
[1:01:23] uncover or to lay bare. I have some uh
[1:01:27] just a half a dozen or so slides. I'd
[1:01:30] like you to see how this is used in the
[1:01:33] Bible. The word lighten, it appears in
[1:01:36] the New Testament just 18 times.
[1:01:39] And uh
[1:01:47] let's see here.
[1:01:52] Okay.
[1:01:54] If I may have the the uh the next
[1:01:57] portion please.
[1:02:16] Okay, you read these and then
[1:02:20] breaking away.
[1:02:31] Somehow
[1:02:32] these are not the
[1:02:43] I saved I saved a number of slides here
[1:02:46] but it seems that this isn't exactly
[1:02:51] uh the ones that I had in mind.
[1:03:07] Uh those aren't they
[1:03:10] those are good, but they're not the ones
[1:03:11] I had.
[1:03:15] So, I hope you enjoyed reading reading
[1:03:18] that. I'm probably will read some of
[1:03:21] those uh some of those quotes as we move
[1:03:23] on. But let let me just get to this uh
[1:03:26] uh I want to go back to the word
[1:03:29] lighten. It's used 18 times in the New
[1:03:33] Testament. And here's how it's used.
[1:03:38] Oh my. Well, let's try that then.
[1:03:45] That was it. Who's ever using this
[1:03:48] thing?
[1:03:51] All this technology is so marvelous.
[1:04:00] If I can just get up there, what I see
[1:04:02] down here, brothers, it'll just be
[1:04:04] wonderful.
[1:04:18] All right,
[1:04:20] we're making some headway.
[1:04:22] I hope you have a little time. The way
[1:04:24] things are going looks like we might
[1:04:25] need a little bit of time.
[1:04:29] All right, it's used as lighten once,
[1:04:33] revelation or revealed 14 times
[1:04:37] manifestation once coming of Christ once
[1:04:40] the appearing of Jesus Christ once his
[1:04:43] appearing. So the word lighten,
[1:04:46] revelation, revealed, manifestation,
[1:04:49] coming and appearing. Those are the
[1:04:52] words that are used in the New
[1:04:53] Testament. So when and the scripture
[1:04:56] says, now just collect your thoughts
[1:04:59] with me. And Simeon came by the Holy
[1:05:03] Ghost
[1:05:05] and took the child
[1:05:08] and spoke and uttered these words. A
[1:05:11] light to lighten the Gentiles. And when
[1:05:16] you come to lighten now, a light to
[1:05:19] reveal, a light that will be a
[1:05:21] revelation to the Gentiles, a light that
[1:05:25] will be a manifestation. It will be
[1:05:27] something that will be brought evident
[1:05:29] before them. Cause them to see it. This
[1:05:32] is something that God is doing just the
[1:05:35] same as Jesus Christ himself. I I mean
[1:05:38] here Simeon by the Holy Ghost is brought
[1:05:40] into he's he's drawn into by the Holy
[1:05:43] Ghost into an into an event in his life
[1:05:47] and now he's holding a a little infant
[1:05:50] child in his arms and he's prophesying
[1:05:53] and saying strange things. This will be
[1:05:55] a light to lighten the Gentiles. This
[1:05:58] will this right here, what is embodied
[1:06:02] here is going to be a a manifestation to
[1:06:05] the Gentiles. This right here is going
[1:06:07] to be a revelation to the Gentiles. And
[1:06:10] yet he was coming to Israel at that
[1:06:12] time. But that was the purpose. He will
[1:06:14] be a light to lighten the Gentiles. And
[1:06:17] this will be this will refer also to his
[1:06:20] appearing. This will refer to his
[1:06:22] coming. All of these are are linked
[1:06:26] together and in that one word, a light
[1:06:29] to lighten the Gentiles. And here are
[1:06:32] the here are some scriptures as they
[1:06:34] come. You'll see how it's used in the in
[1:06:38] the New Testament. A light to lighten
[1:06:41] the Gentiles and uh the glory of thy
[1:06:45] people Israel.
[1:06:56] For the earnest expectation of the
[1:06:59] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[1:07:02] of the sons of God.
[1:07:08] Now to him that is of of power to
[1:07:11] establish you according to my gospel and
[1:07:14] the preaching of Jesus Christ according
[1:07:16] to the revelation of the mystery which
[1:07:20] was kept secret since the world began.
[1:07:23] the the the revelation of the mystery.
[1:07:26] In other words, to lighten this is the
[1:07:28] purpose is to lighten uh uh to lighten
[1:07:32] the people of something that had been
[1:07:34] kept secret. And in the book of
[1:07:36] Revelation is the last time it's used,
[1:07:38] the revelation of Jesus Christ, which
[1:07:40] God gave unto him to show unto his
[1:07:42] servants things which must shortly uh
[1:07:45] come to pass. And he sent and signified
[1:07:47] it by his angel unto his servant.
[1:07:54] And to you who are troubled, rest with
[1:07:57] us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed
[1:08:01] or for the purpose of lightening to
[1:08:04] lighten from heaven with his mighty
[1:08:07] angels. And that the trial of your faith
[1:08:10] being much more precious than of gold
[1:08:12] that perisheth, though it be tried with
[1:08:15] fire, might be found unto the praise and
[1:08:18] honor and glory at the uh appearing,
[1:08:23] which is the same word lighten of Jesus
[1:08:26] Christ.
[1:08:31] So that you come behind in no gift
[1:08:34] waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus
[1:08:37] Christ. a light to light. And those are
[1:08:39] just the scriptures which I thought
[1:08:41] would be uh
[1:08:44] important so you can tie together how it
[1:08:48] is used in the New Testament. Now,
[1:08:54] brother Brandon makes this quote because
[1:08:58] uh I'll say as an introduction, there
[1:09:01] are many many phrases and I'm going to
[1:09:04] refer to quite a few of them this
[1:09:06] morning that have reference to light. I
[1:09:10] want to speak about the light of truth,
[1:09:15] the light of freedom,
[1:09:18] the light of morality,
[1:09:22] things that we enjoy
[1:09:25] in our in our country, in our
[1:09:29] civilization.
[1:09:31] Things that we enjoy, we shouldn't take
[1:09:33] them for granted,
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; but they are light.
[1:09:37] And while we
[1:09:40] enjoy them as light, I want us also be
[1:09:42] mindful things that you are enjoying in
[1:09:46] these various uh areas that I want to
[1:09:50] focus on. I like to also be mindful that
[1:09:53] there are those that are not enjoying
[1:09:58] that light
[1:10:01] and there are those that are in a
[1:10:04] mixtury.
[1:10:06] They're not in a a life of total
[1:10:10] darkness, but neither are they in a
[1:10:12] light of truth,
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; but they're enjoying at least some
[1:10:17] measure of light. They're in a evening.
[1:10:22] They're in a dusk time and that's very
[1:10:25] very evident and I'm sure that you'll
[1:10:27] see it much clearer. Now, what is light?
[1:10:31] And brother Brandham, he's very very
[1:10:33] explicit. Light is the word of God made
[1:10:39] manifest.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; In the beginning said, "Let there be
[1:10:44] light."
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "If a fog came, then it wasn't
[1:10:48] God's word.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Let there be light." It might have been
[1:10:52] hundreds of millions of years after God
[1:10:56] said it. But once God said it, it was
[1:10:59] going to become evident. It was going to
[1:11:02] become manifested. And there was a
[1:11:04] purpose in it becoming manifested
[1:11:06] because God intended that that the light
[1:11:09] would bring uh into being some other
[1:11:11] things that he wanted to express his own
[1:11:14] thoughts and his own mind. And so the
[1:11:16] light brought forth life. He said life
[1:11:19] life only comes by the word of God made
[1:11:23] manifest. And as long as it is just in
[1:11:27] the book like this, as long as it's just
[1:11:30] in the book like this,
[1:11:34] It still can be questioned.
[1:11:36] But when it's made manifest,
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; when it happens, when it becomes an
[1:11:43] event, then it can no longer be
[1:11:45] questioned.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Once it's manifest, he says, then you
[1:11:49] see the product. Hallelujah. We've seen
[1:11:52] the product. Amen.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; I'm sure even with Simeon when he said
[1:11:58] those words, those that were gathered
[1:11:59] there and those who were listening,
[1:12:01] those who were had also brought their
[1:12:03] children maybe wondered at the kind of
[1:12:05] words he was saying, perhaps saying, "I
[1:12:08] wish he could pray that kind of prayer
[1:12:09] over my baby."
[1:12:12] But now the Holy Spirit was causing him
[1:12:15] to say something because now God's word,
[1:12:19] God's promise through Isaiah had become
[1:12:22] evident and had become manifested. But
[1:12:25] it was only the beginning because there
[1:12:27] was so much more that would be made
[1:12:29] known through him. And so he said it is
[1:12:31] become manifested. And then he said that
[1:12:34] is light on the word. When God's word
[1:12:38] becomes manifested then that's light on
[1:12:40] the word. That is the first time you can
[1:12:42] actually understand what the Bible said
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; is when it's manifested
[1:12:50] and a man can turn on the light. He said
[1:12:51] Christ is the light. Of course, the
[1:12:54] whole world will say that. And the word
[1:12:57] manifested is the light of the hour.
[1:13:01] Let there be light and there was light.
[1:13:03] Yes, sir. Let there be light and there
[1:13:07] is light.
[1:13:08] And then in the in the message shalom
[1:13:11] once again just I want to lay these
[1:13:13] down. He said the sun I want you to
[1:13:16] think about the sun is the word of God.
[1:13:21] In the beginning God said let there be
[1:13:24] light. And when the manifested word of
[1:13:28] God when the word of God was manifested
[1:13:32] there was light. So God spoke it, but
[1:13:36] when it manifested, then light came. And
[1:13:39] when light came, that is the word of
[1:13:41] God.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God manifested. He
[1:13:45] said, "First God spoke it." What if it
[1:13:48] didn't manifest? Then it wasn't light
[1:13:50] yet. But when he spoke it, and then when
[1:13:56] it was then it was manifested or
[1:13:58] vindicated,
[1:14:00] his word was vindicated.
[1:14:02] light came into existence and that's the
[1:14:06] only way that it can be done now.
[1:14:10] So now we go from Genesis 1 to today and
[1:14:14] that's still the only way that light can
[1:14:18] come. God has to have spoken it. Amen.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; I did some research and in,
[1:14:28] you know, in my studies, you got
[1:14:30] thinking about the people talk about the
[1:14:33] light of truth. Oh my goodness. I tell
[1:14:37] you what, it's the darkness of
[1:14:39] confusion.
[1:14:41] every guru
[1:14:43] and every great teacher
[1:14:46] and all religions
[1:14:49] just uh a total mass of confusion.
[1:14:54] But if you read their words, the words
[1:14:57] will say that the truth of light. They
[1:15:00] have the truth of light. And if you come
[1:15:03] to this, you'll have the truth of light
[1:15:05] and you'll have some kind of peace. And
[1:15:07] somewhere along the line, you'll have a
[1:15:09] few exercises of yoga thrown in just for
[1:15:12] good measure because you're going to
[1:15:14] come to the truth. You're going to come
[1:15:16] to the light of this truth. Oh, utter
[1:15:19] confusion.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Utter just nonsense.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Just man's thoughts, man's words. But if
[1:15:26] you only and that's why a prophet he
[1:15:28] gives it he gives it full I tell you he
[1:15:31] gives it full uh uh ability and and full
[1:15:34] measure when he says if it's just in the
[1:15:36] book it's just in the word it still can
[1:15:39] be questioned but when God hallelujah
[1:15:43] almighty God takes that word and breaks
[1:15:46] it evident and say here it is folks here
[1:15:49] it is in full view then you can't
[1:15:51] question it anymore
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; that is why you find you find in all the
[1:15:58] areas all the areas of opposition and
[1:16:02] question concerning brother Brandham's
[1:16:04] life and his ministry have to do they'll
[1:16:07] take some word that he spoke but they
[1:16:11] cannot deny the evidence
[1:16:15] when the evidence is brought forth by a
[1:16:18] supernatural almighty God it's beyond
[1:16:22] question
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; and I've never had anybody I've had all
[1:16:25] Times do people come in to debate with
[1:16:27] me about what brother Brandham said, but
[1:16:30] they never once in my entire life have
[1:16:32] they come to debate about what happened
[1:16:35] on the platform, what happened in the
[1:16:38] evidence when the evidence came forward.
[1:16:40] There is no space to question the
[1:16:43] evidence. I thank God we're not we're
[1:16:46] not on this, you know, this word or that
[1:16:49] word. But when God took that word and
[1:16:52] brought it before the people and said,
[1:16:54] "Here's what I said."
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Here's the evidence.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Then it's beyond any question.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; And when it's manifested, he said,
[1:17:06] "That's when it's light." Yeah.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; When something happens then and you know
[1:17:11] that God did it because no man can do
[1:17:13] it. That's what God intended to be
[1:17:16] light. That's what he intended for us to
[1:17:19] be responsible for.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; That's what he'll judge the world by.
[1:17:25] What they had an opportunity to see.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:36] And he said here,
[1:17:40] "And when the word of God was
[1:17:42] manifested, there was light."
[1:17:46] And that's the only way it can be done
[1:17:48] now. It's when when the word is
[1:17:51] vindicated,
[1:17:52] God's written word. So we have the
[1:17:55] written word. Oh, of all the debate and
[1:17:57] discussion. Can you can you just imagine
[1:18:00] for a moment the volumes of books that
[1:18:04] are contrary one from the other? Can you
[1:18:08] imagine what 3,000 denominations over
[1:18:11] 3,000 dominations have gathered out of
[1:18:14] this book? Can you just imagine for a
[1:18:17] moment all the different theories of the
[1:18:20] book of Revelation alone? Can you just
[1:18:23] let your mind and imagination try to
[1:18:26] drift out into the great great somewhere
[1:18:29] and imagine the volumes and millions of
[1:18:32] books and theories that are written
[1:18:35] concerning this book and if you were
[1:18:37] turned loose and I said to you discover
[1:18:40] the truth
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; you'd say it's impossible
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; and I'd say you're exactly right
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; completely impossible
[1:18:50] so it's incumbent
[1:18:52] It's absolutely essential that whoever
[1:18:56] is the author of this book come and make
[1:18:58] it live.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; And unless he makes it live, you'll
[1:19:04] never know what the truth is.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; And if anything that if what Simeon said
[1:19:11] was truly of the Holy Ghost, that this
[1:19:13] is a light to lighten the Gentiles, then
[1:19:16] he was saying this is a light that will
[1:19:18] manifest. This is a light that will make
[1:19:21] it evident. This is a life that's going
[1:19:23] to make it happen. This is a life that's
[1:19:25] going to do something.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; This is a light that's going to bring it
[1:19:29] right into appearance.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; And you will have no mistake because
[1:19:34] God, the life that was in him will do
[1:19:36] it.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; It's not going to just be a theory. It's
[1:19:40] not just going to remain in the Torah.
[1:19:42] It's not just going to remain in the
[1:19:44] Bible. It's going to be it's going to
[1:19:45] become a living word.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it's not a light to lighten.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; And he said, God in this word
[1:20:01] has given a portion of the word for
[1:20:05] every age.
[1:20:07] And then he sends along
[1:20:10] his elected
[1:20:12] individual,
[1:20:14] maybe a prophet or a messenger
[1:20:18] or a reformer, whatever he has called
[1:20:22] for that age, for that moment in time.
[1:20:26] And that vessel has been called and
[1:20:28] ordained of God. So that God by the Holy
[1:20:32] Spirit will take this little portion of
[1:20:35] this word and cause that individual to
[1:20:39] make that word come alive.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; It's for that age.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; And the reason for that is so that the
[1:20:46] people of that time can behold it
[1:20:50] because it will come into view and the
[1:20:52] light will shine upon it and the person
[1:20:55] will make it live. And then he doesn't
[1:20:57] have to say I he doesn't have to say I
[1:21:00] want your attention people. I'm going to
[1:21:01] make this piece of scripture live.
[1:21:04] That's not what happens. He just comes
[1:21:05] out reads a scripture and God does
[1:21:08] through the individual what he intends
[1:21:10] to do for that age. And the people can
[1:21:13] see it and say that's God
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; because a man can't do that. That's God.
[1:21:18] And now what do they receive? They
[1:21:20] receive light.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Knowledge comes.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Understanding comes. truth comes and now
[1:21:28] they know how I must live and how I must
[1:21:32] conduct myself because a vindicated word
[1:21:36] has spoken it.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Something that works happened.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to have a gospel that
[1:21:42] works?
[1:21:47] I had here just to go back to Eden for a
[1:21:50] moment. Before the word could manifest
[1:21:54] in Adam and Eve
[1:21:56] before the word even had an opportunity
[1:21:58] said multiply,
[1:22:01] replenish the earth, multiply and bring
[1:22:04] forth. But before that could happen,
[1:22:08] the serpent moved in
[1:22:10] and he added one word.
[1:22:14] And by adding one word, shadows
[1:22:18] came,
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; a heavy dusk came,
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; and before very long they found
[1:22:26] themselves in darkness and nighttime.
[1:22:30] And the Bible says Adam lost his way. Of
[1:22:34] course, he lost his way because darkness
[1:22:37] had encompassed him. And the darkness
[1:22:40] came because light came by word.
[1:22:43] Darkness also came by word.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Is the congregation getting that?
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Light came by word. And when God spoke
[1:22:52] it, then it came into being. It came
[1:22:55] manifested. And then people had light.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Whether it was the light of the sun or
[1:23:01] the light of understanding, whatever it
[1:23:03] was. But now the serpent added a word.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; You shall not surely die
[1:23:13] and darkness came
[1:23:16] and the perfect light
[1:23:18] was eclipsed.
[1:23:21] Why don't you just hold that word? The
[1:23:23] perfect light was eclipsed
[1:23:26] by another word, by another
[1:23:30] thought.
[1:23:31] He said in God of this evil age and the
[1:23:34] bride of Adam believed Satan's knowledge
[1:23:37] against God's word and the bride of
[1:23:40] Christ has believed Satan's knowledge in
[1:23:44] this intellectual evil age against God's
[1:23:48] word and notice Eve in the natural that
[1:23:51] believed it and plunged the whole human
[1:23:54] race to death. Let me ask you,
[1:23:58] is death light or is death darkness?
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; It's darkness, isn't it?
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Is sickness light or is it darkness?
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; I'd say it's darkness.
[1:24:17] Is poverty light
[1:24:20] or is it actually darkness, a heaviness?
[1:24:23] If you had to live in utter poverty,
[1:24:28] is confusion light or is it darkness?
[1:24:32] It's darkness.
[1:24:34] So, we have a lot of darkness
[1:24:38] to contend with.
[1:24:42] Morality,
[1:24:44] a moral purity, is it light or is it
[1:24:47] darkness? It's light.
[1:24:49] Immorality.
[1:24:51] Evil
[1:24:53] is darkness.
[1:24:57] Plunged the whole human race to death.
[1:25:01] Adam, the natural man of the earth, his
[1:25:03] bride, before he got to her to be wife,
[1:25:07] plunged the whole human race into death.
[1:25:10] Whether it's scientific or not, we uh we
[1:25:14] die just the same.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; We're dying people, friends. And there
[1:25:19] probably isn't anyone here but what has
[1:25:21] been touched
[1:25:23] by the separation of death
[1:25:27] and this darkness.
[1:25:29] And if we could, we'd avoid it. If we
[1:25:32] could, we'd change it. But we're all
[1:25:34] headed there.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Every person that's here is headed
[1:25:37] there.
[1:25:39] You better make certain you have a
[1:25:40] light, the light of truth that goes
[1:25:43] beyond this little brief life. you that
[1:25:47] are here and young and you look towards
[1:25:49] a great great future,
[1:25:52] you don't really know how much future
[1:25:54] you have because even the life that you
[1:25:56] have and the youth that you have and the
[1:25:58] strength that you have and whatever it
[1:26:00] is that you have and whatever it is that
[1:26:02] God has given you that has made your
[1:26:04] life full of light and and happiness and
[1:26:08] joyful and so on, just remember that
[1:26:11] darkness is not very far. It's just the
[1:26:13] other side of the the other side of the
[1:26:15] globe. Amen.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Whether you're in holy
[1:26:20] Eden or holy church or holy
[1:26:24] denomination," and that would include
[1:26:27] everybody here or whatever it might be,
[1:26:30] you will die the day you disbelieve one
[1:26:33] word of God's word. Isn't that a
[1:26:37] staggering statement? Doesn't matter
[1:26:39] whether you're in Holy Eden or a Holy
[1:26:42] Church or in Cloverdale Bible Way or
[1:26:45] wherever you might be or whatever
[1:26:47] denomination or whatever it might be
[1:26:49] that you're in. If you disbelieve one
[1:26:52] word of God's word to be the truth, when
[1:26:56] it's vindicated and proved to you, not
[1:26:59] when it's just in a book being debated
[1:27:01] and being discussed, but when it's been
[1:27:03] proven to you. when it's been vindicated
[1:27:07] to you. He said, "A man
[1:27:11] and God's truth is vindicated and proved
[1:27:13] to you, that's the day you separate
[1:27:15] yourself from God." And just one more
[1:27:18] before I
[1:27:20] more or less get into the substance of
[1:27:22] the message.
[1:27:24] And we see by representation of this
[1:27:26] word as Satan misrepresented it to Eve
[1:27:29] caused her to doubt one word and threw
[1:27:31] the whole human race into a fallen
[1:27:34] chaos. Just one word.
[1:27:38] He says then we see in the middle of the
[1:27:39] book came our Lord and Savior and he
[1:27:42] gave us the quotation concerning it. Man
[1:27:45] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:27:48] every word that proceedth out of the
[1:27:50] mouth of God. Brother Brandham is going
[1:27:52] from Eden from Genesis to the middle of
[1:27:56] the book and now to Revelation and the
[1:28:00] solemn warning at the last of the book
[1:28:02] of the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:28:04] Whosoever shall add one word or take
[1:28:07] away uh or take away his part will be
[1:28:10] taken from the book of life.
[1:28:15] So I say to this congregation this
[1:28:18] morning, if words
[1:28:21] uh if words of light
[1:28:24] uh versus words of darkness,
[1:28:28] one word was added brought the darkness.
[1:28:30] I believe that
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; I happen to believe that one word in the
[1:28:35] beginning brought
[1:28:37] every sick hospital, every bed
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; in the hospital where the sick people
[1:28:41] are. One word brought every prison cell
[1:28:46] onto the earth.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; One word. Who can assimilate in their
[1:28:53] mind and grasp the depth of darkness
[1:28:56] that can come by one word? It behooves
[1:28:59] us to believe every word of God. It
[1:29:02] behooves us to live by every word of
[1:29:04] God.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; So I just speak now for a moment on the
[1:29:09] light of truth.
[1:29:12] We're going to turn a couple of sharp
[1:29:14] corners here in a few moments.
[1:29:18] The light of truth.
[1:29:20] The psalmist said, "Thy word is a lamp
[1:29:23] unto my feet and a light unto my
[1:29:25] pathway."
[1:29:27] He said also in Psalms 119:13,
[1:29:30] "The entrance of thy words giveth light.
[1:29:34] It giveth understanding unto the
[1:29:36] simple."
[1:29:37] Peter said in his epistle, "We have also
[1:29:41] a more sure word of prophecy, where unto
[1:29:44] you do well that you take heed as unto a
[1:29:47] light that shineth in a dark place until
[1:29:51] the day dawn and the day star rise in
[1:29:54] our hearts." A wise man Solomon said in
[1:29:57] Proverbs, "For the commandment is a lamp
[1:30:01] and the law is light."
[1:30:06] These are powerful. And John has said,
[1:30:11] "I have no greater joy than to hear that
[1:30:15] my children walk in truth."
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Walking in truth was walking in light.
[1:30:23] The truth is light.
[1:30:28] I believe it's important for us as
[1:30:31] individuals to be truthful with
[1:30:33] ourselves.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; And you have to think about that
[1:30:38] sometimes it's difficult to be truthful
[1:30:40] with your own self. What your
[1:30:43] convictions
[1:30:44] the the voice of God to your own heart.
[1:30:48] We need to be truthful to ourselves. We
[1:30:52] need to be truthful to what God has said
[1:30:56] that you are.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; And I find that this is a big
[1:31:00] contravention
[1:31:01] even amongst message believers. It's
[1:31:03] hard for them. Many, it's hard for them
[1:31:07] to actually confess with conviction that
[1:31:11] what God has said. Let me let me give
[1:31:14] you a little secret
[1:31:16] which I feel has been a secret in my
[1:31:18] life for myself as an individual. There
[1:31:22] isn't any man or woman who walks with
[1:31:24] God but what hits the bottom of the
[1:31:28] barrel sometime.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; You really strike bottom.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; And when you do, I'll give you this.
[1:31:38] What I consider has been a secret for me
[1:31:40] in my life. I've hit bottom. Everybody's
[1:31:43] hit bottom. I think we'd be less than
[1:31:46] truthful if we said, "Oh, no.
[1:31:47] Everything's just uh beautiful and
[1:31:49] wonderful all the time." No, that might
[1:31:51] be the facade. That might be what we
[1:31:54] portray. That might be how people see
[1:31:57] us. But down inside, you're the only one
[1:31:59] who really knows. And that's when you
[1:32:00] have to be truthful with yourself.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; You have to say, "Well, am I really on
[1:32:05] the bottom?" And Satan comes in with all
[1:32:07] of his hordes of hell and tells you that
[1:32:09] there is no hope and you're not even a
[1:32:11] believer. And if there is a rapture, for
[1:32:14] sure you're not going in it. And all
[1:32:16] kinds of things. And the world just
[1:32:18] presses in. And I can tell you that uh
[1:32:21] Satan has a lot of uh imps and a lot of
[1:32:24] spirits to bring every kind of
[1:32:26] oppression to an individual. So what
[1:32:30] this joyous time the world, this is one
[1:32:33] of the most depressing times. They talk
[1:32:35] about Christmas and all of its joys and
[1:32:37] all the rest of it. It's a it's a
[1:32:39] ranting raving mob out there
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; and they're talking about having a wild
[1:32:45] party and all of these things at
[1:32:46] Christmas. What a debauchery.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; What a disgrace
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; to the very Christ. They seem to uh want
[1:32:55] to make reference and they use it as an
[1:32:57] excuse for all of these things.
[1:33:01] What is the secret? The secret is this.
[1:33:05] That when you get reduced down to your
[1:33:08] feelings are going contrary.
[1:33:11] Circumstances have gone contrary.
[1:33:15] As far as anything that you might feel
[1:33:18] is a bright spot, there is no more
[1:33:20] bright spot. I'm talking about we as
[1:33:23] individuals arrive there. What is the
[1:33:25] key? What is the secret? I'll tell you
[1:33:29] my little secret is this.
[1:33:34] You need to say
[1:33:37] what God has said
[1:33:39] about you.
[1:33:42] Amen.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Because what God has said is truth.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; And if you begin to confess the truth,
[1:33:50] all I can tell you somewhere along the
[1:33:52] line, the light's going to shine again.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; It might not be in the next five
[1:33:58] minutes, but if you begin to say, "This
[1:34:00] is what God Almighty has said." And I
[1:34:03] ask myself, do you believe that Jesus is
[1:34:06] the son of God? Yes, I do. Do you
[1:34:09] believe that he died for your sins? Yes,
[1:34:11] I do. And he that believes shall be
[1:34:14] saved. Yes, I do. I believe that. And I
[1:34:18] just begin with the basic understanding
[1:34:20] of that. Do I believe that this
[1:34:22] supernatural that has come about in this
[1:34:24] age by his prophet messenger doing
[1:34:27] things that no human could do? Do you
[1:34:30] believe it was Jesus Christ just in the
[1:34:32] last few days? I said, Jesus, none other
[1:34:35] than you could do that. And he said it
[1:34:38] was none other than the pillar of fire.
[1:34:41] And I as I was preparing this message, I
[1:34:43] said there's been no message, there has
[1:34:46] been no doctrine that has come across
[1:34:49] the face of the earth that has been so
[1:34:51] attested to by a light, a pure light, a
[1:34:55] glorious light. I never saw the pillar
[1:34:58] of fire. Other people have. I've been
[1:35:00] right where it came. I've been in its in
[1:35:03] in under the impact of its presence. I
[1:35:06] couldn't deny it. But as far as seeing
[1:35:09] something with my natural eye, but I can
[1:35:11] tell you one thing, that pillar of fire
[1:35:14] did things. I had to believe that
[1:35:16] because I saw it go out into the
[1:35:18] audience. I saw that the word of truth.
[1:35:22] And you find out how many times the
[1:35:24] prophet said, "Is that true?"
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Raise your hand if that's true. Did they
[1:35:29] ever fail to raise their hand? No, they
[1:35:31] raised their hand. Is that the truth?
[1:35:33] Then you know it's the spirit of truth.
[1:35:36] If it's the spirit of truth, then the
[1:35:38] truth can only bring light.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; And once you have light, you know where
[1:35:44] to walk. Once you have light, you're not
[1:35:46] in confusion anymore. Once you have
[1:35:49] light, you're not even in the dusk
[1:35:51] anymore. You're not just in the dawning
[1:35:54] of a new day. You're in the light.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For the light of this word.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; I thank God for you people that have
[1:36:02] have come into this light. This isn't
[1:36:05] light because I say it's light. It's not
[1:36:08] light because William Brandham said it's
[1:36:10] light. That's not light. It's light
[1:36:12] because God made the word work.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Because God made the scripture manifest.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking now just about
[1:36:19] blessings. I'm not talking just about
[1:36:21] healings. All all kinds of people, any
[1:36:24] kind of people. He even said a
[1:36:26] prostitute can be healed because faith
[1:36:28] is a law.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; And if you put the laws of God into
[1:36:31] practice, you can be healed. You can
[1:36:33] have all kinds of blessings, but that is
[1:36:36] not the because you have those blessings
[1:36:38] doesn't mean you've come into eternal
[1:36:39] life.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; But eternal life can only come by the
[1:36:42] word of God.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Be truthful
[1:36:50] to yourself. Be truthful about what God
[1:36:52] said about you.
[1:36:56] Being born in a barnyard
[1:37:01] doesn't really matter if you only know.
[1:37:04] But if you know, you must know that you
[1:37:06] came from an eagle egg.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; If you've been born in the barnyard and
[1:37:13] you're not say, well, I maybe came from
[1:37:15] a chicken egg and then that's a problem.
[1:37:19] It doesn't matter. We've been born in
[1:37:21] the barn. Doesn't matter. We've been
[1:37:22] born in Leodysia. Doesn't matter. is uh
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; destitute
[1:37:28] that
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; the generation may be that you've been
[1:37:30] born in as long as you know your hatch
[1:37:32] from an eagle's egg.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Be true to God's word.
[1:37:39] True in the truth in the pulpit.
[1:37:43] And that's why it's not always so
[1:37:44] acceptable because it has to be truth
[1:37:46] from the pulpit.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Truth in government. Taking a little bit
[1:37:52] of a curve just now.
[1:37:59] We're so accustomed to hearing politics
[1:38:03] and politicians
[1:38:06] and the US has their primaries primaries
[1:38:09] just now and and different ones are
[1:38:12] stating what they're going to do and
[1:38:17] and their thoughts whether we should be
[1:38:19] in Iraq or we shouldn't be in Iraq.
[1:38:21] Bring the boys home. No, keep them over
[1:38:23] there.
[1:38:25] Medicare, this is what we need to do.
[1:38:28] Everybody's got their plan.
[1:38:33] And it's not that they that the
[1:38:36] individual doesn't have good intention,
[1:38:39] but brother Brandham says it very
[1:38:41] clearly, the system corrupts them.
[1:38:44] Even a priest that goes into the
[1:38:46] priesthood in the Catholic church or a
[1:38:48] nun that goes into the service of of
[1:38:52] some area of of of the Catholic church.
[1:38:57] She may wear the ring
[1:38:59] married to the church. He said they
[1:39:02] don't go in to be bad people,
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; but the system corrupts them.
[1:39:08] Even within the realm of the message, we
[1:39:10] have to be just constantly on the, you
[1:39:14] know, on our on our toes and be careful.
[1:39:18] We we don't want a system as such. We
[1:39:22] just want God amongst us. We want the
[1:39:24] great shepherd leading us. We want the
[1:39:27] Holy Spirit on a constant basis. And we
[1:39:30] can't afford not to have it. Amen.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; And we need to come into the house of
[1:39:34] God saying, "I want to be led by the
[1:39:36] Holy Spirit. I want the shepherd to feed
[1:39:39] me today. Use the man of God." I don't
[1:39:42] know if you prayed for myself and
[1:39:44] Brother Tom's going to preach tonight or
[1:39:46] the brothers who preach behind the
[1:39:47] pulpit. We need to pray for them. We
[1:39:49] need to pray that God will utter his
[1:39:52] thoughts through them.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Cause something to become evident,
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; something of reality.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:03] truth in government
[1:40:06] and truth in religion.
[1:40:08] And once the shadows of of untruth
[1:40:12] or the darkness begins to cloud the
[1:40:15] truth, it's not long before a person
[1:40:18] walks in darkness.
[1:40:22] I think of America as a nation because
[1:40:27] brother Brandham was raised in that
[1:40:30] nation and that was God's doing.
[1:40:34] He spoke on uh
[1:40:38] uh
[1:40:39] on a Thanksgiving right after
[1:40:41] Thanksgiving day. He says, "Tonight I
[1:40:43] want to say there's so many things that
[1:40:46] I'm thankful for.
[1:40:48] I don't know how to give thanks to God
[1:40:50] for so many blessings. I'm sure we feel
[1:40:52] that way. He says, ' Tell your children
[1:40:55] about it.
[1:40:58] Tell them that this nation was built
[1:41:00] upon such as that. Our forefathers who
[1:41:04] fought to bring this freedom and I'm
[1:41:07] coming now to freedom is light as long
[1:41:10] as it remains as freedom.
[1:41:13] Tell them of this freedom
[1:41:18] that was they fought to bring this
[1:41:20] freedom to us and left the other country
[1:41:22] so that they could have freedom of
[1:41:24] worship
[1:41:26] and freedom of speech
[1:41:28] and freedom of press and so forth. And
[1:41:32] we're thankful yet for it. We don't know
[1:41:35] how long it will last that way. But I
[1:41:38] say this long. May our land be bright
[1:41:41] with freedom's holy light. Protect us by
[1:41:46] thy might. Great God our king. I thought
[1:41:50] for many here of other countries and
[1:41:53] other background probably don't know
[1:41:55] where brother Brandham got that phrase.
[1:41:59] It is this poem. It is my country is of
[1:42:03] thee sweet land of liberty. Of thee I
[1:42:06] sing, land where my fathers died, land
[1:42:10] of the pilgrims pride. From every
[1:42:13] mountainside
[1:42:15] let freedom ring.
[1:42:17] And the chorus must be a song. Land
[1:42:20] where my fathers died. Land of the
[1:42:23] pilgrims pride. From every mountainside
[1:42:27] let freedom ring. He was quoting from
[1:42:29] the last verse. Our father's God, to
[1:42:33] thee, author of liberty,
[1:42:38] to thee we sing, long may our land be
[1:42:41] bright with freedom's holy light.
[1:42:44] Protect us from protect us by thy might.
[1:42:49] Great God our King.
[1:42:52] Long may
[1:42:54] our land be bright with freedom's holy
[1:42:58] light. Amen.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; True freedom
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; is a light.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Long may our land be bright with
[1:43:08] freedom's holy light. Protect us by thy
[1:43:12] might, great God, our king.
[1:43:16] It's amazing this same prophet would
[1:43:18] have to come to Jezebel religion.
[1:43:22] And so this great nation of ours, we
[1:43:24] come here and on Plymouth Rock, the
[1:43:28] nation was founded on freedom of
[1:43:30] religion
[1:43:32] because our forefathers had fled Roman
[1:43:35] persecution of the modern Jezebel system
[1:43:39] and had come up and stood many great
[1:43:42] persecutions and martyrdom
[1:43:46] under the false system of Jezebel.
[1:43:49] And according to the Bible of Revelation
[1:43:51] the 13th chapter, God had promised them
[1:43:54] an oasis and a place for the woman was
[1:43:57] carried away into the wilderness where
[1:44:00] she was fed for a time, a time and a
[1:44:03] dividing a time.
[1:44:06] God had made a promise to America
[1:44:09] or to the church, to the woman to come
[1:44:13] into this country.
[1:44:15] Did you ever put that together?
[1:44:19] He's pulling out of Revelation 12 and 13
[1:44:23] saying God made a promise to this
[1:44:25] country to find an oasis
[1:44:29] for her freedom
[1:44:32] and freedom is light.
[1:44:36] Freedom opened up the door
[1:44:39] unfortunately for darkness.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take you right angles just
[1:44:44] now.
[1:44:47] There were many nations under communism
[1:44:51] just in the last few years and they were
[1:44:54] under the oppression and under
[1:44:55] dictatorship
[1:44:57] and under the cruel hand and we over
[1:45:00] here we felt oh my those poor people and
[1:45:06] they need our sympathy and they they
[1:45:09] have almost nothing to live by. They're
[1:45:13] in such poverty and we are in such
[1:45:16] abundance. We have so much and they have
[1:45:19] so little and we have so much freedom
[1:45:21] and they are they're so restricted they
[1:45:24] can't move a boat. They can't even go
[1:45:26] from one place to another and we just
[1:45:28] get in our car or our train or our our
[1:45:30] plane and we travel wherever we want and
[1:45:33] we don't have to have all of these
[1:45:34] restrictions and freedom finally came
[1:45:36] and the wall went down between East and
[1:45:40] West Germany and and nations and
[1:45:42] uprisings and in Poland and so on and
[1:45:45] nations and communism fell and oh the
[1:45:48] light of freedom came
[1:45:51] but with it came sin. and debauchery
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; and immorality
[1:45:59] until now that's a bigger problem
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; than their bondage was
[1:46:08] and violence
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; and criminal activity in Moscow itself
[1:46:15] has made it an unsafe place a place
[1:46:18] where we have several three churches
[1:46:19] just come together and they've called on
[1:46:21] us to help them build a building they
[1:46:24] don't have a building to worship in. You
[1:46:25] talk about poor, they're poor people and
[1:46:27] they need a building to worship in.
[1:46:31] And we need to help them.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; We're taking on a lot.
[1:46:38] That's not why I'm standing here today,
[1:46:40] but I'm standing here to say, "Oh,
[1:46:42] freedom is is glorious. Freedom is
[1:46:45] marvelous. But with the light of freedom
[1:46:47] and when freedom blasted open the doors
[1:46:51] in came
[1:46:53] such sin.
[1:46:55] I can't help but remember and I just
[1:46:57] forget which president it was that was
[1:47:00] in power whether it was President Reagan
[1:47:02] or an earlier president that was here
[1:47:05] and when Kruef came over on one visit
[1:47:09] and may have been more than one visit
[1:47:11] and you remember he's mentioned in the
[1:47:14] message as he took his shoe off and
[1:47:15] pounded it on the table at the United
[1:47:18] Nations but on that they wanted to show
[1:47:21] him America and they were going to take
[1:47:23] him to Las Vegas and show them the can
[1:47:26] can girls and and show them an evening
[1:47:28] out. And here one who would be called a
[1:47:32] dictator from a severe communist country
[1:47:36] was a rebuke to America and her freedom
[1:47:38] and refused to go.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; He had no interest in seeing that
[1:47:42] nakedness. No interest in seeing all
[1:47:45] that uh sexual uh uh whatever you would
[1:47:49] call it. Had no interest in it
[1:47:51] whatsoever. And here God had a leader of
[1:47:54] a communist country bring a rebuke to a
[1:47:58] leader of the most powerful nation on
[1:48:00] earth. Why? Freedom. Freedom has light
[1:48:04] but freedom also has darkness.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; I hope you can say amen to it.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; In Jubilee year
[1:48:17] he said God is not a respect of nations.
[1:48:20] He's not a respect of people. He wants
[1:48:23] whosoever will and if one nation will
[1:48:26] bloom and do all of this and stand, that
[1:48:30] empire will last forever.
[1:48:33] But he says, "But every world empire
[1:48:36] will be broken down at the coming of the
[1:48:38] rock that's hued out of the mountain
[1:48:41] without hands, and that'll break all the
[1:48:44] world's kingdoms into pieces. And Christ
[1:48:47] will rule and reign. and his reign shall
[1:48:50] be no end. Can the congregation give
[1:48:53] praise and worship to this one?
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; And his name shall be called counselor,
[1:49:01] prince of peace, mighty God, the
[1:49:03] everlasting father. And the government
[1:49:06] shall be upon his shoulders and of his
[1:49:09] kingdom there shall be no end.
[1:49:11] Hallelujah. For this kingdom of truth.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; We've been born into that kingdom.
[1:49:17] We live by that kingdom.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; He said that's the kingdom of our God
[1:49:24] that shall come with power and
[1:49:26] demonstrations and all the rest of the
[1:49:29] world will be broken shot to pieces. He
[1:49:32] says they're going to they're going to
[1:49:34] reject it. Nations reject it. Churches
[1:49:38] reject it. Individuals reject it. So
[1:49:42] that God can judge the nations. He can
[1:49:45] judge the churches. He can judge the
[1:49:48] individuals. For a man that comes to the
[1:49:51] truth and fails to walk in the truth,
[1:49:56] then he has, according to the scripture,
[1:49:59] he's blasphemed or rejected the Holy
[1:50:02] Spirit of God and passed the day of
[1:50:06] redemption. I tell you my brother, my
[1:50:09] sister, this generation doesn't really
[1:50:13] know what they have seen, what they have
[1:50:16] experienced, and what they have
[1:50:18] rejected.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; God came with a spirit of truth in the
[1:50:24] end time. He manifested the word before
[1:50:28] the eyes of the leaders. It is no
[1:50:31] secret. It was not done in a corner.
[1:50:34] This message we talk about a message is
[1:50:36] not just my word above someone else's
[1:50:39] word. It's not that. It's God came on
[1:50:42] the scene, manifested his word year
[1:50:45] after year before tens and hundreds of
[1:50:47] thousands and even millions of people so
[1:50:50] that he could say to this last dying
[1:50:52] age, I have vindicated and manifested
[1:50:56] the truth and I have come to lighten the
[1:50:59] Gentiles, the last generation.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; A light to lighten the Gentiles. And
[1:51:06] here they have their Christmas and all
[1:51:08] of their all of their debauchery and
[1:51:11] sin. And and with the freedom has come
[1:51:13] darkness. And with the truth has come
[1:51:16] darkness.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Where's no truth in government? Here
[1:51:20] they are. Here they are even having
[1:51:23] criminals write the law for you.
[1:51:31] and binding you to have to live by it. I
[1:51:33] don't want to get off on that. Freedom
[1:51:36] also opens the door for the base nature
[1:51:40] of man.
[1:51:42] Freedom for every and any lifestyle.
[1:51:45] The light of holiness and the light of
[1:51:47] purity and the light of cleanness.
[1:51:56] Knowledge is light. I have to just move
[1:51:59] a little bit quicker. My time is has
[1:52:02] slipped away and I want to close fairly
[1:52:04] soon.
[1:52:08] But perhaps I shouldn't go too quick.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; I found this a most compassionate
[1:52:19] portion.
[1:52:22] as brother Brandham is describing the
[1:52:25] age in shalom.
[1:52:27] So you notice men today, you don't find
[1:52:30] that genuiness.
[1:52:32] You don't find it in women.
[1:52:35] But you notice that women in our day,
[1:52:37] they don't seem to have that ladylike
[1:52:40] that they once had.
[1:52:45] I was just walking with my wife this
[1:52:48] last week.
[1:52:52] And you have to you have to forgive me.
[1:52:56] But I like when I see a a lady to look
[1:52:59] like a lady
[1:53:02] and one after the other after the other
[1:53:05] after the other. You go down through a
[1:53:07] mall and and they got big sloppy jeans
[1:53:10] on and their hair just hanging uncamped
[1:53:14] and and walking in these big lumberjack
[1:53:17] boots and look like they're going to
[1:53:20] work. And I said, I can't imagine
[1:53:23] a man having to go home and meet that as
[1:53:27] his wife.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; It's the most incredible thing. How do
[1:53:31] you How do you even
[1:53:38] Well, if that's all we had, fellas, I'd
[1:53:40] say I I'd probably give up on marriage,
[1:53:42] too. But I'm glad there's some ladies in
[1:53:45] the land.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; And you ladies, I tell you what, you're
[1:53:49] jewels before that kingdom of God. And
[1:53:52] you are what you are because there's
[1:53:54] been truth.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; You have a truth to walk in. You have
[1:53:58] something that God has made evident. And
[1:54:01] now here you are evident.
[1:54:04] Amen.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; And he says this.
[1:54:08] He says to be ladylike that like they
[1:54:10] once had. He says they want. Now listen
[1:54:13] to this.
[1:54:15] They want to,
[1:54:18] but there's something that won't let
[1:54:20] them do it. It seems like there's a
[1:54:22] heaviness.
[1:54:24] He said, "You tell a lady that she
[1:54:26] should do such and such a thing and the
[1:54:28] lady looks upon that and believes that."
[1:54:35] She wants to believe that, but there's
[1:54:37] something that presses her. I just want
[1:54:40] you to catch that, please, that I'm
[1:54:41] coming to an ending soon. There's
[1:54:43] something that presses her the other
[1:54:45] way. He said, see, he said, "Poor
[1:54:48] thing." He says, you ought to hear him
[1:54:51] say it. Poor thing. He said, "I feel
[1:54:54] sorry for her. She's She's so caught up
[1:54:59] in a web." And I want you to count
[1:55:01] these. There's about eight or nine of
[1:55:03] them. She's so caught up in a web of
[1:55:06] Hollywood
[1:55:09] and the advertisements
[1:55:12] and the television
[1:55:14] and the radio
[1:55:18] and the newspaper
[1:55:21] and on the street and in the store
[1:55:24] windows
[1:55:25] with the modern dress and so forth. and
[1:55:29] the way that other women meet her.
[1:55:34] You you need to write those down.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; They have an effect, young ladies,
[1:55:40] especially those of you that maybe not
[1:55:42] so young but conscious about your
[1:55:44] appearance.
[1:55:49] And so here we see, you know, moving in
[1:55:53] and Hollywood has permeated the entire
[1:55:56] globe.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Is it light? No, it's darkness.
[1:56:01] And he's accentuating
[1:56:04] the woman's body
[1:56:07] to bring more darkness
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; and more sin and more perversion. And
[1:56:14] it's permeating and making it enticing
[1:56:18] and and and something desirable and
[1:56:21] appealing and you know the colors and
[1:56:24] all of the fashion in the radio and the
[1:56:27] television and the magazines and the
[1:56:29] media and all these things bring it
[1:56:32] before the people dazzling
[1:56:35] the eyes of the people to bring it down.
[1:56:39] But it's darkness. It's darkness. And
[1:56:43] there's a there's a great truth I want
[1:56:45] to bring to you just before I close. I
[1:56:47] must bring it to you. There's just waves
[1:56:51] waves of corruption.
[1:56:55] I don't know. It might not be in my time
[1:56:58] and yet it might be.
[1:57:02] But I see us as a body of believers
[1:57:06] headed on a collision course
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; with the immorality
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; and the perversion of this generation
[1:57:15] because there's laws that are in place
[1:57:18] and laws that are not only in place but
[1:57:21] are going to be enforced
[1:57:23] that's going to go directly opposed to
[1:57:27] your faith. And at some point in time,
[1:57:31] you're going to have to stand and stand
[1:57:34] for truth because truth is light.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; And if you give into it and compromise,
[1:57:39] remember I will tell you today, if you
[1:57:41] say compromise, I will just say
[1:57:43] darkness.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; With compromise comes shadows of night
[1:57:46] and darkness. And with all of that will
[1:57:49] come in immorality and all kinds of
[1:57:52] things. Even if we're swept aside with
[1:57:55] all the fashions of the world and all
[1:57:57] the activity of the world, it's not
[1:57:59] light, friends. It's darkness.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; And even when people hear, they say,
[1:58:04] "Yes, I know." And the prophet is saying
[1:58:06] they're caught in it. It's kind of
[1:58:08] caught in some kind of a web and we feel
[1:58:10] sorry for them. That is true. We may
[1:58:13] have a compassion, but we cannot afford
[1:58:17] to surrender up.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; That's right. our faith in Jesus Christ
[1:58:22] or surrender up what the word of God has
[1:58:25] said.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; He said it seems that there's something
[1:58:32] that they just can't pull away from. And
[1:58:35] so now here I'm not at the end, but I'm
[1:58:38] going to close.
[1:58:42] He said in the message shalom and I just
[1:58:44] I'm giving a principle now because I
[1:58:46] want to draw to a close
[1:58:51] what makes it says rise and shine for
[1:58:55] your light has come
[1:58:59] and the second verse and grows darkness
[1:59:02] upon the people. And I've never heard
[1:59:04] anyone ever in my entire life approach
[1:59:08] and actually interpret that. And he says
[1:59:10] it in a very simple way. He said as
[1:59:12] gross darkness, I could give you a
[1:59:14] number of quotes. I haven't got time.
[1:59:16] This the gross darkness
[1:59:18] is because the light has come and is
[1:59:23] pressing the darkness back where it came
[1:59:27] from
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; and I begin to rejoice.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, "God is light."
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I am light." And he
[1:59:40] pressed that darkness because the light
[1:59:42] came and it had to congregate together.
[1:59:45] And now says, "You are light. You are
[1:59:48] light." And it had to be it had to be
[1:59:51] God help me to be able to say it right.
[1:59:53] It had to be at at this age. It couldn't
[1:59:56] be at another time. That is why a a
[1:59:59] ministry of this stature, a ministry of
[2:00:01] this nature, a message of this
[2:00:04] magnitude.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; That's true. It is such a it's a message
[2:00:08] of such magnitude.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Who's even assemble who who's even
[2:00:12] assimilated a part of it? None of us.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; It's a mammoth message that has come and
[2:00:19] nuggets throughout the entire message.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; What does it mean to you when I tell you
[2:00:23] there's there's about 7 8 900 messages
[2:00:26] you've never read?
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Falls very silent.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; What's it mean to you?
[2:00:36] What should it mean to me, Brother Ed?
[2:00:38] It shouldn't mean to you.
[2:00:41] Which are they?
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Where are they?
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Where do I get them? How do I lay my
[2:00:45] hands on them? How do I hear these
[2:00:47] nuggets? How do I hear these truths that
[2:00:49] have been sent to me in this day? It
[2:00:52] might be a there may be a key. There may
[2:00:53] be a secret right there. I need to read
[2:00:55] it. I need to allow the Holy Spirit to
[2:00:58] take that word and make it live within
[2:01:00] me and give me the power and give me the
[2:01:02] light that I need.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:08] that really bothered me in the last few
[2:01:10] months. Not for you, for me.
[2:01:13] And I'm in the message of every day,
[2:01:17] but it started to bother me as we
[2:01:19] started to work on the kiosk and we're
[2:01:21] working on other things because we want
[2:01:23] to make we want to make this message
[2:01:25] available to as much of the world as
[2:01:27] possible. And there's brothers that are
[2:01:28] sitting in this in this congregation
[2:01:30] who've spent hundreds of hours and will
[2:01:32] probably spend thousands more to get it
[2:01:34] so that people people anybody who has a
[2:01:37] and believe me all kinds of people
[2:01:39] children young people are just young
[2:01:42] children going to have computers and
[2:01:43] what and are even today.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Well, I know there's maybe some here say
[2:01:47] I don't know how to turn a computer on.
[2:01:49] Well, that's your fault.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Well, I I I'm my children aren't going
[2:01:54] to have it. Well, and that's fine, but
[2:01:56] they don't have to have it, but but make
[2:01:58] sure that they get it another way. Don't
[2:02:00] deprive them of the word.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; And some might say, "Well, only one
[2:02:04] message is enough." Well, it may be
[2:02:07] enough if there isn't another one
[2:02:08] available.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; But another one's available.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; And I see myself, friends, like I'm
[2:02:17] standing here before you. I I I see
[2:02:19] myself I think a great deal about
[2:02:21] crossing over. And I think a great deal
[2:02:24] about standing before God.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; And as it was that the angel said,
[2:02:31] "You're gathered with your people." And
[2:02:33] brother Brandham gathered with the
[2:02:34] people.
[2:02:37] And I might be sitting down with
[2:02:39] somebody around a table just visiting
[2:02:41] whatever more.
[2:02:44] But I see myself being looked at
[2:02:47] and saying, "Uh,
[2:02:50] what what did you do with what was given
[2:02:53] you?"
[2:02:57] You don't know how badly I've said it
[2:02:59] here before. You don't know how badly I
[2:03:02] want to say I did what I could.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; I did what I could.
[2:03:13] I lived what you showed me.
[2:03:16] You ladies that are mothers,
[2:03:19] you want to be able to say, I did what I
[2:03:21] could. I instructed my children. I lived
[2:03:26] before them.
[2:03:28] I tried to always express and show it
[2:03:30] was Jesus Christ. I did what I could.
[2:03:34] What did you do as fathers?
[2:03:37] It wasn't easy.
[2:03:40] I worked in places that I'd sooner not
[2:03:43] been. I worked under the
[2:03:47] noise, irritating noise of booming music
[2:03:51] and
[2:03:53] aggravating situations.
[2:03:56] But I labored and I lived before them
[2:04:00] because I needed to bring
[2:04:02] home food for my family. I brought them
[2:04:06] to the house of God.
[2:04:09] made many mistakes, but I lived.
[2:04:13] And Lord, where I failed, forgive me.
[2:04:17] But I did what I could.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; And I believed the word that you sent.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; If this isn't God's word, friends, if
[2:04:27] this message isn't God's word, believe
[2:04:29] me, I'd be on a search as of this
[2:04:31] afternoon to find out where it was. We
[2:04:34] need truth.
[2:04:36] We need something God has attested to. I
[2:04:40] would look for it. I mean, I I I see the
[2:04:43] things that are out there in the world.
[2:04:45] I read uh just in the last few days, one
[2:04:49] of the largest, I think the largest
[2:04:51] church in America,
[2:04:54] they have tens of thousands of people
[2:05:00] and a young minister which took over
[2:05:02] from his father.
[2:05:05] I think they have around 20 27,000
[2:05:08] members
[2:05:12] and his father was Pentecostal
[2:05:14] minister
[2:05:16] and they asked him the interviewer asked
[2:05:20] him what do you say what he said I just
[2:05:23] tell the people he said I want them to
[2:05:26] feel good about themselves there's so
[2:05:28] much that's negative in the world
[2:05:30] there's so much that's trouble and
[2:05:32] negative in the world and I I want I
[2:05:34] want to tell the people who they are and
[2:05:36] I want to tell the people uh uh uh to to
[2:05:39] to look upon themselves and think good
[2:05:41] about themselves. He said because I
[2:05:43] don't want to I don't want them to be
[2:05:45] burdened and want them to be troubled.
[2:05:46] Well, that that is fine. And I I mean he
[2:05:49] has to answer for what he's going to
[2:05:50] preach to his people. But I tell you, I
[2:05:54] want to be able to tell people something
[2:05:56] of substance so that when you come to
[2:05:59] the river, there's a light there for
[2:06:01] you.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; And that the message is preached with
[2:06:04] clarity and in simplicity so that you
[2:06:08] can take it and say this is something we
[2:06:10] can take into our home and we can live
[2:06:12] by this and we have some assurance. And
[2:06:14] I I can say only one thing, friends.
[2:06:17] We're living by a message. We're
[2:06:19] preaching a message that God himself
[2:06:22] supernaturally has vindicated. And when
[2:06:24] he vindicated, that was a manifestation
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; and that was the fulfillment.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; But Simeon's words, a light to lighten
[2:06:35] the Gentiles.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; And with this, just give me a couple
[2:06:38] more minutes.
[2:06:42] I find it very very unusual
[2:06:46] that at this particular time when when
[2:06:48] when Simeon held that babe in his arms,
[2:06:52] Rome was the power
[2:06:56] and the influence that the the people
[2:06:59] were living under. And even Joseph had
[2:07:02] to flee to Egypt because they sought the
[2:07:05] child's life.
[2:07:07] And here we are at the end of the time.
[2:07:10] The seventh messenger has come. A
[2:07:13] vindicated message given before the
[2:07:16] thousands and tens of thousands. And in
[2:07:18] the scientific age where the picture
[2:07:20] could be taken of the pillar of fire and
[2:07:22] the angel of the Lord and then God would
[2:07:25] put it into the hearts of the people to
[2:07:27] propagate it so that millions more can
[2:07:29] hear and see about it. A message a a
[2:07:32] message that came with such vindication.
[2:07:34] And the vindication was always light.
[2:07:37] That meant something to me. It's light
[2:07:40] here, light there, light. It's all milky
[2:07:42] white. It's light.
[2:07:44] So, the message has come accompanied
[2:07:46] with light. And it came in America.
[2:07:53] When that messenger was raised and when
[2:07:55] the prophet of God was raised up in
[2:07:57] America, America wasn't the singular
[2:08:00] superpower of the earth.
[2:08:02] But as the message progressed
[2:08:05] and began to spread
[2:08:08] and churches and people began to be
[2:08:10] believers of it, America also became the
[2:08:15] single great superpower
[2:08:18] of the earth.
[2:08:20] But as the scripture said,
[2:08:23] listen close now.
[2:08:26] As the scripture said and the prophet of
[2:08:28] God pointed to the 13th chapter of
[2:08:30] Revelation said America is in there.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; That is her chapter
[2:08:36] and she was like a lamb but spoke as the
[2:08:40] dragon
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; and the dragon is always Rome.
[2:08:46] He spoke like the dragon. I happen to
[2:08:49] have the sequence here of how
[2:08:55] the Vatican
[2:08:57] made agreements
[2:09:01] with uh Mr. Arafat
[2:09:05] for the holy places
[2:09:07] because they wanted to encourage that
[2:09:10] these people of Palestinians shall have
[2:09:12] a state and within that state will be
[2:09:16] Bethlehem. Within that state will be
[2:09:19] Hebron. Within that state will be
[2:09:22] Jericho. Within that state, that state
[2:09:24] will encompass Judea and Samaria, which
[2:09:27] is actually part of the kingdoms of
[2:09:29] Israel. And they made an agreement. And
[2:09:32] so the Vatican threw all their weight
[2:09:34] behind it, and begin to call and do
[2:09:38] their diplomacy
[2:09:40] a state for the Palestinian people. And
[2:09:43] at that time, America was not saying
[2:09:45] those words. But as time went on and
[2:09:49] darkness began to invade more into the
[2:09:53] nations of freedom,
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; into the nations of of liberty, in the
[2:09:57] nations of wealth and the people who
[2:09:59] have influence in the world
[2:10:03] and because of the influence of the
[2:10:05] western civilization and their freedom
[2:10:08] and their liberty, other places and
[2:10:10] other nations of such a uh such
[2:10:13] dictatorship and control under such a
[2:10:16] cruel man had begun to break apart. God
[2:10:18] even knew that. And those nations would
[2:10:21] look and say they craved they craved the
[2:10:24] wealth of America. They craved the
[2:10:27] freedom of America. They crave this kind
[2:10:30] of thing. And they opened their doors
[2:10:31] and in came Hollywood. And in came the
[2:10:34] sin. Are you with me?
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; And in came the darkness.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Not only the light, but the darkness
[2:10:42] came in.
[2:10:46] And it seemed that the darkness came in
[2:10:48] much faster.
[2:10:50] They don't have the total freedom of
[2:10:51] worship and the total freedom of the
[2:10:53] gospel. But the darkness came in. And
[2:10:57] then here we come right to this end
[2:10:59] time. And here we are. And in the last
[2:11:01] few days,
[2:11:04] America is making one more attempt.
[2:11:08] Condisa Rice, who is the the most
[2:11:12] powerful diplomat in the world,
[2:11:16] was interviewed a few days ago by the
[2:11:19] British uh British Broadcasting
[2:11:21] Corporation from England, the BBC,
[2:11:24] and said, "You are uh you are making
[2:11:28] another attempt, and this seems to have
[2:11:31] it be a priority. Is this very very
[2:11:33] important?" Yes, she said, "This is very
[2:11:35] important. It's not the only priority.
[2:11:37] I've got Korea to think about and I have
[2:11:40] Iraq to think about and I have Iran to
[2:11:42] think about. But yes, this is this is a
[2:11:45] this is a priority
[2:11:50] that the Palestinians
[2:11:53] have a state. So really, let's put it in
[2:11:56] Bible language. This is a priority of
[2:11:59] our country that we give away some of
[2:12:03] the land. And God said to Abraham, "This
[2:12:06] is my covenant."
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; Can this congregation say, "Amen."
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; God said to Abraham, "This is my
[2:12:14] covenant. This land is for you and your
[2:12:17] seed after you." Amen.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; And now here we are down uh in a nation
[2:12:24] that has received a prophet, vindicated
[2:12:27] prophet whose cities have been visitated
[2:12:30] by the spirit of truth and light. Light
[2:12:34] has come to lighten the Gentiles. But in
[2:12:38] the midst of that is the deepest of
[2:12:40] darkness upon the people.
[2:12:43] Amen.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; And the greatest leader, the most
[2:12:45] powerful leader on earth
[2:12:49] is bringing those two together.
[2:12:52] Bringing the leader of Israel,
[2:12:55] not elected, but a leader of Israel and
[2:12:58] the prime minister and the leader of the
[2:13:00] Palestinian people to make one more
[2:13:03] attempt. They've tried it at Oslo.
[2:13:06] They've tried it at Camp David. And now
[2:13:08] they try it once again. and and and
[2:13:12] getting a commitment from them that this
[2:13:14] can happen by 208
[2:13:17] or at least during 208 this will happen.
[2:13:21] I wonder friends really what is going to
[2:13:26] cause God to move.
[2:13:29] But I think that when man
[2:13:32] begins to take God's word and carve it
[2:13:35] up because we need oil and we got to
[2:13:38] keep friends with those people or
[2:13:40] because we need a military uh logistical
[2:13:44] place, a strategic place. We need this
[2:13:47] for our military power. We need this for
[2:13:49] one reason or for another. And and and
[2:13:51] we're sitting here waiting for the
[2:13:53] rapture. I believe that great events are
[2:13:56] in the offing very very near whenever it
[2:14:00] it scares me when I see man take a hold
[2:14:04] of not nations they can do what they
[2:14:06] want with nations but when they take a
[2:14:08] hold of God's word when God says this is
[2:14:11] my covenant with you I've given you this
[2:14:13] land and a man takes a hold of it and
[2:14:15] says we're going to divide it up we're
[2:14:17] going to divide it up we're a superpower
[2:14:19] we're the head we're going to divide it
[2:14:21] up and and actually is saying
[2:14:26] what the dragon has said,
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; but they don't know that while they're
[2:14:31] pushing for this, they're actually
[2:14:32] pushing. They're actually introducing
[2:14:35] the desire of the harlot church.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; The church wants all of those sacred
[2:14:41] places and they know they're already a
[2:14:43] commitment to receive them with this
[2:14:46] kind of a with this kind of an
[2:14:47] arrangement. And so now the scripture is
[2:14:50] being fulfilled right in front of us as
[2:14:53] we sit here. This been happening in the
[2:14:54] last two weeks.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; This Bible is more important and more up
[2:15:00] to date than tomorrow morning's
[2:15:01] newspaper.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; And that is gross darkness upon the
[2:15:08] people. I say that to say to you how you
[2:15:11] ought to appreciate the light that God
[2:15:14] has given us to walk in. Amen.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; That's my message to you.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[2:15:22] Hallelujah.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; Let's thank him.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, we'll walk in the light. It's a
[2:15:28] glorious light. Come where the dew drops
[2:15:32] from heaven are bright.
[2:15:35] Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[2:15:38] Hallelujah. Let's not conclude as a
[2:15:41] Sunday morning service. Let's say thank
[2:15:43] God for the word that we have received.
[2:15:46] Thank God for the message that he has
[2:15:48] sent us. Uh what a wonderful thing to be
[2:15:51] able to say to you young men and young
[2:15:53] ladies. Oh, you've got a bright future,
[2:15:56] but it's not in this world. You got a
[2:15:59] bright future that lays before you. Walk
[2:16:02] in the truth. We'll walk in the light as
[2:16:04] the glorious light. We'll walk in the
[2:16:09] light.

[2:17:10] the song down from his glory to close
[2:17:13] this service today.
[2:17:16] Ever living story. It hasn't gotten
[2:17:19] stale, has it? I hope you didn't mind
[2:17:22] the kind of heavy message this morning,
[2:17:25] but I think it would be I I I I feel
[2:17:28] it's our responsibility as ministers and
[2:17:31] especially myself to bring before the
[2:17:34] congregation something that you need to
[2:17:35] think about. You need to ponder. You
[2:17:38] need to pray about and go out of here
[2:17:40] and say, "Thank God we're not walking in
[2:17:43] some shadows."
[2:17:47] Amen.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; God's always been concerned about the
[2:17:50] nations.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; Even the birth of Jesus Christ has all
[2:17:55] to do about the nations.
[2:17:57] A light to lighten the Gentiles.
[2:18:00] [Music]
[2:18:09] Are we Gentiles? Yes.

[2:18:53] gentile. Where are we?
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; Is this light?
[2:18:58] And you'll have to say, "No, it's I
[2:19:00] can't walk in that.
[2:19:06] It's not light." Say, "Where is the
[2:19:08] light?"
