[9:20] that this morning. Amen. His
[9:22] faithfulness to us is great. Amen. Isn't
[9:24] he wonderful to us?
[9:27] Amen. and we just want him to come this
[9:29] morning. And
[9:31] so often we pray for revival. Brother
[9:32] Brandham said revival isn't so much an
[9:35] outreach or an evangelistic
[9:37] event. It's just reviving what we've
[9:39] already had. Amen. And if we look back
[9:40] over what he's done for us, we can say
[9:42] great is his faithfulness. Amen. We just
[9:44] want to fan the flames this morning.
[9:47] Amen. Realize all that he has done for
[9:49] us. Amen. We don't want to just take it
[9:51] for granted or forget those things that
[9:52] he's done for us. Amen.
[9:56] I'd rather
[9:59] have Jesus
[10:02] than silver
[10:04] or gold.
[10:07] I'd rather
[10:08] be his
[10:11] and have riches
[10:13] on.
[10:16] I'd rather
[10:18] have Jesus
[10:21] house
[10:23] or land.
[10:25] I ra
[10:27] be le
[10:30] by his
[10:32] garden
[10:33] [Music]
[10:34] to me. Yeah.
[10:38] Heat.
[10:42] [Music]
[10:52] I
[10:55] have Jesus.
[11:03] [Music]
[11:10] I would rather
[11:13] have Jesus
[11:16] and man
[11:18] of law
[11:20] and I'd rather
[11:22] be faithful
[11:25] to his
[11:27] dear.
[11:29] I would rather
[11:31] have Jesus
[11:34] than a world.
[11:36] [Applause]
[11:38] And I rather
[11:40] be true
[11:42] to his
[11:55] [Music]
[12:01] way.
[12:05] I will
[12:07] have Jesus
[12:10] and
[12:12] anything
[12:13] [Music]
[12:15] worth
[12:16] the
[12:18] [Music]
[12:22] for he is fairer
[12:25] than liies
[12:28] of rare as blue.
[12:32] is sweeter my
[12:36] than the
[12:41] he is all that my hungering
[12:46] spirit
[12:48] me
[12:50] I'd ra
[12:57] [Music]
[12:59] to be
[13:01] Yeah. Heat.
[13:06] [Music]
[13:16] I
[13:18] have Jesus.
[13:24] [Music]
[13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just going to sing that one
[13:33] more time. We're going to have brother
[13:34] Ed come and open the service in a word
[13:35] of prayer. Amen. It says rather have him
[13:39] in all these things. Amen. And the
[13:41] wonderful truth in our hearts is that we
[13:43] do have him. We can have him this
[13:44] morning. Amen. This is a fulfilled
[13:47] promise this morning. Let's sing the
[13:48] third verse.
[13:50] He's rarer, fairer than the liies,
[13:55] how rare
[13:57] is blue,
[14:00] and he's sweeter
[14:02] than honey
[14:04] from a honey.
[14:09] He is all that I
[14:14] sp
[14:17] [Music]
[14:20] have Jesus
[14:23] and let him be
[14:27] and to be
[14:29] the king
[14:32] Oh,
[14:36] and we
[14:46] My brother
[14:48] Jesus
[14:55] [Music]
[15:06] have your seats. God bless you.
[15:13] going to have prayer in a few moments,
[15:15] but we want to
[15:18] uh speak a few moments about a couple
[15:21] very urgent prayer requests.
[15:24] Uh one is for our brother
[15:29] Esther
[15:31] Paris,
[15:32] brother Derek and sister Debbie and
[15:34] their little one. Uh
[15:39] the little baby David is going to be
[15:42] taken to Philadelphia
[15:44] uh Children's Hospital for pancreatic
[15:47] surgery
[15:48] probably in the next two to three weeks
[15:50] or two to four weeks. And that's what we
[15:53] we understand.
[15:55] Uh you know, I'd like to say the
[15:58] congregation uh God's not uh afraid of
[16:01] doctors.
[16:03] uh and uh a doctor will simply confirm
[16:06] that a healing has taken place.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; That's all uh I know I have I've gone to
[16:12] doctors when I had that real it's almost
[16:16] 14 years now and that herniated disc
[16:19] pressed against my spine and they said I
[16:22] had to rush right in. We'll get you dead
[16:24] bed as quickly as possible.
[16:27] But that that's a time I think that a
[16:29] person wants to do everything right
[16:31] according to the word and uh I try to
[16:34] follow that as closely as possible. So
[16:38] this morning, we're going to pray for
[16:41] the Paris family and for little David as
[16:44] well and pray that God will
[16:48] uh raise him up and whether God does the
[16:51] healing right now by faith, does a
[16:54] miracle or heals through doctors or
[16:56] heals through love, all of those things.
[17:00] What the prophet said, I believe that
[17:02] because nobody had a ministry like just
[17:05] equal that. and uh we can just have that
[17:08] pillar of fire move in over him and
[17:11] it'll be done.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; So, we're thankful for that. We've just
[17:16] seen too many things happen of a
[17:18] supernatural nature.
[17:21] When I was here last service, I spoke,
[17:24] which a week ago, last Wednesday.
[17:27] Uh, and for those of you that try to
[17:29] archive it, you can't archive it because
[17:31] it wasn't recorded and it wasn't
[17:33] streamed for obvious reasons and it's
[17:36] not available. But for those of you that
[17:39] were here, I showed some pictures of
[17:42] some of the people in uh in Switzerland.
[17:47] And one of the pictures uh showed
[17:50] brother Gerard Michel and his wife
[17:53] Angela who we'd stayed with. uh than
[17:56] than myself
[17:59] and another young man, excuse me, that
[18:02] was actually a son-in-law
[18:05] of uh brother George's brother who's a
[18:08] pastor and his name is Brother Jane
[18:11] Jacques
[18:13] uh just day before yesterday now just
[18:18] three weeks ago or less than three weeks
[18:19] ago we were with him and day before
[18:22] yesterday he's a pastor
[18:25] Uh but day before yesterday, he had an
[18:27] appointment
[18:30] at 9:00 in the morning and his wife
[18:32] works for Swiss Air. Uh and so she was
[18:37] gone to the airport uh where she works
[18:40] and that's where we were able to meet
[18:41] her as well. And uh a brother who he had
[18:46] an appointment with at 9:00 in the
[18:48] morning came over to the house and
[18:51] knocked on the door and there was no
[18:52] answer. And so he knocked
[18:55] uh again and was quite persistent but
[18:58] there was no answer from within. He did
[19:00] something that I wouldn't have done and
[19:03] I thought it was very very unusual and I
[19:05] think very few people would do it. You
[19:07] knock the door there's no answer. You
[19:08] think well maybe he had to step out or
[19:10] whatever. He called an ambulance
[19:13] and the ambulance came up and they
[19:16] smashed a window and went in and found
[19:20] him in bed unresponsive
[19:23] and they took him quickly to the
[19:25] emergency. The doctors have since said
[19:28] that a few minutes just a few minutes
[19:30] later and he'd have been gone.
[19:33] Uh they didn't know what it was. They
[19:36] struck they he's been struck down with a
[19:38] type of menenitis
[19:41] and uh uh his heart was racing at 250
[19:45] beats. Uh his temperature was way up and
[19:49] they didn't know why any of this was
[19:51] happening.
[19:53] So they have now determined there was a
[19:55] menitis. They don't know what type of
[19:56] menitis. I just got an email just before
[19:59] church and they have just walked out of
[20:01] the hospital and they said that uh
[20:04] temperature had come down slightly.
[20:07] His heart had uh had become more normal
[20:11] but he's still in a coma and I'm not too
[20:14] sure but what he's on life support uh
[20:17] system but he's uh I have a picture of
[20:20] him and his wife and I wonder if we
[20:23] could just uh show that at this time.
[20:26] That's brother Gerard. Not brother
[20:28] Gerard. That's brother Jeanh Jacques.
[20:31] Jean Jeanjhac's uh Michel. And he
[20:35] pastors a church just out of Geneva.
[20:40] And this was our first time to be able
[20:42] to meet and be with him. And so we want
[20:46] to I want to ask this congregation
[20:49] if you will just take this burden upon
[20:51] your heart. And we're going to pray for
[20:53] him. going to pray for David and I'm
[20:56] going to ask brother Dia if you'll come
[20:58] please and I want to have the prayer
[21:02] translated because it will be received
[21:04] over there also they'll be streaming the
[21:07] service and they perhaps take it in to
[21:11] him and to his family I've already heard
[21:13] back from the family today when they had
[21:15] just left the hospital
[21:17] I received also from brother Nanda
[21:19] Chedetti request to pray for him brother
[21:22] Gido from Belgium called. These are
[21:25] other pastors who are known known to our
[21:28] brother Jean Jocks and uh I just feel
[21:32] that God wants to raise him up and
[21:35] that's what we're going to be praying
[21:37] for. I wonder if you'd stand with us now
[21:39] and let us say only believe, only
[21:41] believe. John, would you help us please?
[21:43] Only believe. Only believe. And then
[21:45] Lord I believe I believe. We have no one
[21:48] else.
[21:49] We have none like him.
[21:51] You agree with the songwriter? There's
[21:53] none like you, Lord. We have no one else
[21:56] to turn to. All right. Oh,
[22:00] [Music]
[22:10] all things are possible.
[22:16] Holy,
[22:18] [Music]
[22:21] holy,
[22:23] [Music]
[22:27] holy,
[22:33] all things are possible.
[22:37] [Music]
[22:43] Lord
[22:45] I Let's make that declaration.
[22:49] [Music]
[22:54] [Music]
[23:01] Oh,
[23:02] [Music]
[23:08] I need
[23:11] [Music]
[23:18] all things are possible.
[23:22] [Music]
[23:29] Let's bow our heads in prayer.
[23:33] Father, as we approach you,
[23:38] &gt;&gt; so reverently and humbly coming into
[23:41] your presence.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; We're coming on behalf of the needs of
[23:48] the people.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; And many are the afflictions of the
[23:54] righteous, but the Lord deliver them out
[23:56] of them all.
[24:01] The Lord deliverth them out of them all.
[24:05] And we are praying on behalf of our
[24:07] precious pastor, brother Michel.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; You know exactly his condition at this
[24:15] moment.
[24:17] The doctors may not understand.
[24:20] They may not have identified.
[24:24] We know that it is the enemy
[24:27] and as your prophet said, it is the
[24:29] devil.
[24:31] He comes in sweeping in like a roaring
[24:34] lion,
[24:36] &gt;&gt; but he is not a roaring lion.
[24:40] Your line, you're the line that resurre
[24:45] us.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; Your promises are yay and amenise.
[24:51] Amen. to everyone that believeth.
[24:54] We're praying on behalf of our brother
[24:56] Michal
[24:58] bring him out of that sleep of God.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; Bring him out of that coma. Oh God,
[25:05] may even the sound and the words of your
[25:07] messenger
[25:11] sound in his ear
[25:14] and resound in his soul.
[25:18] We pray that healing virtue
[25:21] delivering power
[25:24] will enter into his room,
[25:27] &gt;&gt; enter into his body
[25:30] and that faith, oh God will be in the
[25:33] heart of every one of his family
[25:34] members.
[25:37] Bring glory out of this situation.
[25:42] Those Lord Jesus who need to be spoken
[25:45] to,
[25:48] &gt;&gt; use this oh God.
[25:51] Speak to each member of the family.
[25:54] Speak to the congregation.
[25:57] And I pray, Father God,
[26:00] &gt;&gt; that you will receive glory
[26:03] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. We thank
[26:05] you now for his gift.
[26:08] We thank you, oh God, for what you have
[26:09] done.
[26:12] Bless, I pray, his wife and family.
[26:16] touch each one of them
[26:18] &gt;&gt; with a special touch this morning
[26:23] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we pray for our little David,
[26:29] baby David. We pray that you will
[26:34] enter the room where he is.
[26:37] [Music]
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, it would delight us to have you
[26:41] perform the surgery.
[26:44] It would delight us, oh God.
[26:47] It would give us great opportunity once
[26:49] again to praise you. But we praise you
[26:51] anyway, Lord. We praise you for his
[26:53] life. We praise you for a godly father
[26:56] and mother. We praise you, oh God,
[26:58] because every good gift comes from the
[27:01] father of lights.
[27:03] Dear Lord Jesus, this other request we
[27:05] have for a pastor in Brisbane,
[27:07] Australia, we pray, oh father, that your
[27:10] hand will guide the affairs of the
[27:14] congregation in the church and their
[27:16] need. And now for this service today,
[27:18] Lord, take your word, I pray. Take your
[27:22] word. You're the only one that can break
[27:25] it down. You're the only one that
[27:27] understands it. You're the only one that
[27:28] can interpret what's written on the
[27:30] pages. And so we pray, oh God, that you
[27:32] will do this, Lord. Give us the
[27:34] interpretation. We pray by the Holy
[27:37] Spirit. And I ask, oh God, there'll be a
[27:40] great hunger in the hearts of the people
[27:41] as they pull on the word as they are in
[27:44] expectation that anything can happen in
[27:47] your presence. And in your presence, the
[27:49] supernatural is happening. I pray you'll
[27:52] smite the enemy on every hand, oh God.
[27:55] every contrary spirit, Lord. Every
[27:57] everyone that may still be in bondage,
[27:59] may they be loosed. I pray, oh Father,
[28:03] anyone that is not filled with the Holy
[28:05] Spirit, may they be filled. May they
[28:07] come to a real birth, oh God, and walk
[28:10] and live as a son and daughter of God.
[28:13] In the name of Jesus Christ, anoint my
[28:15] lips, Lord, in the ears of the people
[28:17] that hear. I pray you'll anoint this
[28:19] day, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. and
[28:22] our brother that's going to be baptized.
[28:24] I pray, oh God, you'll hover over this
[28:26] baptismal and do something special for
[28:28] him. We pray in the name of Jesus
[28:31] Christ, we dedicate this day to you now
[28:34] for your glory. Amen.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[28:39] Thanks, brother Dier.
[28:45] It's a good day.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; It's a good day when we're alive.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. got breath in our lungs and in our
[28:52] body
[28:53] &gt;&gt; to be able to praise him.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Good to look down into your
[28:58] faces.
[29:00] Victory. Is it victory everywhere?
[29:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:06] Praise God.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Well, I want to
[29:11] uh have you turn in your Bibles. We're
[29:14] just going to go to the word now.
[29:16] And uh
[29:19] right after the service, a brother has
[29:21] come down to be baptized. They've driven
[29:23] 6 hours. So I'll see how the service
[29:26] goes. And and if I'm a little bit long,
[29:29] what I might do is uh
[29:32] uh something happened to my sound.
[29:37] Do you hear out there? Now we got it
[29:39] again. All right. There'll be no wires
[29:41] in heaven. Somebody stand and sing that
[29:43] song for me.
[29:45] Uh
[29:47] uh if the if the service carries on a
[29:49] little bit long, what I may do for those
[29:51] of you that may have to slip away, I'll
[29:53] just uh give a prayer to dismiss you if
[29:56] you need to go. Some of those that have
[29:58] driven perhaps a long ways, but our
[30:00] brethren has come 6 hours. As I said,
[30:03] has to go 6 hours back. So we've
[30:05] prepared a baptismal and and brother
[30:08] John Andy's will be baptizing our
[30:10] brother Richmond from Lumbi I believe it
[30:13] is in the Okanogan.
[30:17] Uh
[30:19] I want to
[30:21] take a subject this morning and I'm my
[30:24] scripture reading is very very short. Uh
[30:28] if you wouldn't mind to stand once again
[30:30] and we'll read the scripture.
[30:34] In Isaiah the 61st chapter,
[30:40] we'll read a prophecy of our Lord Jesus.
[30:44] And then we'll be turning to Luke the
[30:46] 4th chapter reading
[30:48] uh a partial fulfillment.
[30:51] And as you're turning the scripture,
[30:53] I'll just say on behalf, I see Sister
[30:56] Sally Dodd looking at me. Sister Sally,
[30:58] Brother Edwin,
[31:00] I I sent testimony
[31:04] of you and your family when you were in
[31:07] a similar situation. I sent that this
[31:10] morning.
[31:12] I said, "A sister who God has raised
[31:16] up." And I will not forget a moment uh
[31:19] brother Edwin as we sat with Sister
[31:21] Sally when she was unconscious and
[31:24] unaware of anything happening and other
[31:27] family members. Sister Sally Jr. was
[31:30] there
[31:31] uh faithfully at your bedside.
[31:34] Uh but I felt I even felt the impact of
[31:37] the faith that was in your heart,
[31:39] Brother Edwin. And and I thought this
[31:42] morning as I was typing that in,
[31:45] praise God, who knows if something like
[31:48] that happened even to inspire faith on
[31:51] this family member. So I sent it to
[31:54] brother
[31:55] uh Jeanjac's brother who we stayed with
[32:00] and they already instantly spread it to
[32:03] the entire family
[32:05] and the family had already received it
[32:08] at the hospital and to me it's a
[32:11] wonderful thing. It wonderful thing we
[32:14] use we use this technology but I'm just
[32:17] happy we can get those we use it for the
[32:19] right purpose
[32:20] &gt;&gt; and we got that testimony out there. So,
[32:22] God bless you, Sister Sally. Brother
[32:24] Edwin, you're here with us as part of
[32:27] the part of the ministry. That's what
[32:29] it's all about.
[32:32] The spirit of the Lord. Isaiah 61 verse
[32:36] one. The spirit of the Lord God is upon
[32:38] me because the Lord hath anointed me to
[32:42] preach good tidings unto the meek. He
[32:45] hath sent me to bind up the
[32:48] brokenhearted,
[32:49] to proclaim liberty to the captives, and
[32:53] the opening of the prison to them that
[32:57] are bound.
[32:59] Then we'll turn to Luke's gospel, the
[33:02] fourth chapter.
[33:10] I'm going to begin reading
[33:13] at the 18th verse.
[33:17] The spirit of the Lord is upon me
[33:21] because he hath anointed me to preach
[33:23] the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me
[33:27] to heal the brokenhearted,
[33:30] to preach deliverance to the captives,
[33:32] and recovering of sight to the blind, to
[33:36] set at liberty them that are bruised, to
[33:40] preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
[33:42] And he closed the book, and he gave it
[33:45] again to the minister, and sat down, and
[33:48] the eyes of all of them that were in the
[33:51] synagogue were fastened on him. And he
[33:55] began to say unto them, "This day is
[33:58] this scripture fulfilled in your ears."
[34:01] Amen. God bless you.
[34:05] You may be seated.
[34:08] Jesus quoted
[34:11] a half of the second verse of Isaiah 61.
[34:15] Quoted only half of the second verse.
[34:18] And that is why he said, "This day is
[34:20] this scripture fulfilled in your ears."
[34:22] The last half, the second half was of
[34:26] course was not fulfilled in the day of
[34:28] vengeance of our God.
[34:31] uh the the content of these scriptures
[34:36] uh that we have just read. If we break
[34:39] it down and I will in just a moment
[34:42] really
[34:45] involve the inner man
[34:47] very much for the exterior
[34:50] but for the inner man
[34:53] to preach the gospel to the poor. Well,
[34:55] the preaching of the gospel we know is
[34:58] not just in word only, but it's in power
[35:00] and demonstration of the Holy Spirit.
[35:03] But the preaching of the gospel, the
[35:05] purpose of the preaching of the gospel
[35:08] is to reach the soul. It the the purpose
[35:11] of the gospel is to come down that one
[35:14] channel to the soul. Not the five for
[35:18] the body, not the five for the spirit.
[35:21] It is for them. But that's not the
[35:24] purpose of the gospel. The purpose of
[35:27] the gospel is to save the soul, the
[35:30] inner man, to heal the brokenhearted,
[35:34] to preach deliverance to the captives,
[35:37] recovering of sight to the blind, to set
[35:40] at liberty them that are bruised, and to
[35:43] preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
[35:45] Those are the six uh the the six items,
[35:49] the six subjects that are involved in
[35:51] the prophecy. And it was partially
[35:54] fulfilled when Jesus, it was prophesied
[35:57] by Isaiah and then partially fulfilled
[36:00] when Jesus took the uh the book and read
[36:04] in the synagogue in chapter 4 of Luke.
[36:08] Now, reference to the brokenhearted
[36:12] only appears twice in the Bible.
[36:16] And the one is Isaiah 61 in the prophecy
[36:21] and that's a prophecy of the coming of
[36:23] the Messiah.
[36:25] And the second time is in Luke 4 which
[36:28] is a partial fulfillment of 61.
[36:32] And both of them speak of the
[36:34] brokenhearted.
[36:36] I want to speak to you this morning on
[36:38] bind up the brokenhearted
[36:42] because you cannot separate that from
[36:45] the ministry of Jesus Christ.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; If Jesus Christ if we say that all that
[36:51] was in God was poured into Christ then
[36:55] we have to say that that attribute
[36:59] that attribute of binding up or healing
[37:01] the brokenhearted was in God. that
[37:04] cannot be diminished. And and
[37:07] furthermore, if that attribute was in
[37:10] God and c and that was poured into
[37:13] Christ, it was obviously obvious that
[37:16] those who who Christ would touch
[37:21] would be in need of that. And then
[37:24] thirdly, if all that was in Christ has
[37:26] been poured into the bride of Jesus
[37:28] Christ, for we are his body, we are the
[37:32] oper we are we are we animate
[37:35] the very virtues of Christ. Then that
[37:39] attribute cannot fail but being in the
[37:42] body of Jesus Christ. And if it is to be
[37:45] in the body of Jesus Christ, it's
[37:48] absolutely clear to us that it will also
[37:51] be needed
[37:54] &gt;&gt; whether we realize it. And there may be
[37:56] a lot of reasons why we don't realize
[37:59] it, why perhaps we don't acknowledge it.
[38:01] Perhaps we don't operate or we're not
[38:04] functioning uh in that realm. It might
[38:07] be because we're not aware or there can
[38:09] be other reasons and I intend to speak
[38:12] about some of those this morning. And
[38:14] I'm praying, I have been praying even
[38:16] while I was away these last few days
[38:19] that there would be a dramatic shift in
[38:22] our agenda,
[38:24] in our lives,
[38:26] &gt;&gt; in our in our consecration
[38:30] that uh and I'm just holding myself back
[38:33] now because we live in a very
[38:37] uh selfobsessed
[38:40] generation.
[38:42] We're taken up with ourselves. We're
[38:45] taken up with our little realm. And I'll
[38:48] get into that a wee bit. I don't want to
[38:50] be too negative on that, but yet it
[38:53] needs to come to the surface. And so I
[38:55] want to uh uh bring that to to the
[38:58] surface as well. So now once in Isaiah
[39:02] 61 and once in in Luke's gospel, fourth
[39:06] chapter.
[39:08] But it's interesting to know and to see
[39:12] how and I'm laying I'm taking my time
[39:14] very very carefully because I want to
[39:17] lay this foundation.
[39:19] Well,
[39:21] Isaiah and God knows exactly how the
[39:24] language would unfold because the
[39:27] language is of the people of the world
[39:28] and their understanding of it. In Isaiah
[39:31] 61, he's saying that
[39:35] he hath sent me to bind the
[39:38] brokenhearted.
[39:40] And then when Jesus came, he said that
[39:44] to heal the brokenhearted.
[39:47] And both of those words are critical in
[39:50] one in the prophecy with saying it's to
[39:53] bind the brokenhearted that that has a a
[39:57] a rather a a duplicate uh not a
[40:01] duplicate but a dual meaning in that to
[40:04] bind on the one hand is maybe to bind it
[40:08] up to bandage it or something like that
[40:10] but it is also to restrain it. Healing
[40:14] is really twofold. We've just prayed for
[40:17] some healing. Healing is twofold. One is
[40:21] the attack of the enemy. The attack
[40:24] within the framework of the physical
[40:27] being or the spiritual being or the
[40:30] emotional being. It has to be brought to
[40:35] uh to to seize. It has to be it has to
[40:39] restrain. It has to be stopped. It has
[40:42] to be uh there has to be resistance
[40:44] against what is taking the health away
[40:48] or what is uh what is distressing. Let's
[40:50] say someone sitting here today may be at
[40:52] the end of themselves and and for
[40:55] whatever reason circumstances and all
[40:57] kinds of things coming against it think
[40:59] this whole thing is pulling apart. My I
[41:02] don't think I can handle anymore. Well,
[41:04] the first thing has to happen is
[41:06] whatever's working contrary to that has
[41:09] to come to an end. That's right.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; That has to be seized, taken a hold of,
[41:14] and say the enemy thus far and no
[41:18] further.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; You can advance no further. This
[41:23] sickness is going no further. This fear
[41:27] is going no further. This condemnation
[41:30] is going no further. This this
[41:34] affliction is going to end now.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:41] The direction that this life is going is
[41:44] going to be seized upon, going to be
[41:46] restrained because the Holy Spirit's
[41:49] going to take control of the situation
[41:52] and it's not going to continue any
[41:54] longer.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; And that was in the prophecy because
[42:01] that's part of the ministry of the
[42:04] Messiah and that's part of the ministry
[42:07] of the bride. Amen.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; And then the second part comes in and to
[42:12] heal the brokenhearted is a put it back
[42:15] together. There's power that's resident.
[42:18] And if you can only realize the power
[42:20] that's resident within the bride body of
[42:23] Jesus Christ to bring healing. Oh, it
[42:26] may not just be lay your hands on
[42:28] somebody or to drop to your knees or to
[42:31] or to utter a prayer in that instant, in
[42:33] that moment, but healing might be over a
[42:36] period of time. Some some people require
[42:39] healing physically over a period of
[42:41] weeks or months or even years, but they
[42:45] improve. They gradually get better and
[42:48] they get better. Well, if that power is
[42:50] within the bride, it might be it might
[42:53] be a healing power and it might call for
[42:56] some instruction at one time, some
[42:58] counsel at one time, some friendship at
[43:01] one time, or fellowship at another time,
[43:03] or the promises of God, or the services
[43:06] or the congregation or the meetings and
[43:09] the anointed word being preached. It
[43:11] might be it might be as as the prophet
[43:13] said, "Bring me a minstrel and play a
[43:16] song."
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Good. All part of it would be all
[43:20] healing. But whatever part it is, it is
[43:23] just healing. It is healing. Sometimes
[43:25] it you're not even conscious that it's
[43:27] happening, but God is using it.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so now we have the two sides
[43:35] to bind the brokenhearted. And I say
[43:38] that's resident here in amongst the body
[43:42] of Jesus Christ. You possess some part
[43:45] of that attribute.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:49] Amen.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; And to heal the brokenhearted
[43:53] is to make it whole and to cure it and
[43:56] to bring it back to a normal life.
[43:59] To be brokenhearted. I just like to give
[44:02] quite a number of things that uh that it
[44:05] has reference to the brokenhearted and
[44:08] it's a word that you're very you can
[44:10] connect to it very easily in the Greek
[44:12] is cardia which of course where you have
[44:15] cardiac arc arrest and so on but so
[44:19] cardia is the is the word and it's the
[44:22] it's considered to be the center of all
[44:24] physical and spiritual life but now this
[44:26] goes into more detail the center and the
[44:29] seat of spiritual to life to heal the
[44:33] brokenhearted.
[44:36] The soul or the mind as it is the
[44:39] fountain and the seat of all thoughts. I
[44:42] can tell you and I tell you without any
[44:46] shame
[44:48] or without any apology.
[44:50] There's many even sitting right here and
[44:53] many under the sound of my voice need a
[44:55] healing in the mind. Amen.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; You need there are thoughts that
[45:00] torment.
[45:02] They may be thoughts of the past. They
[45:05] may be fears of the future. They may be
[45:09] some
[45:11] uh family situation and the mind just
[45:16] ponders that, meditates on that, it
[45:19] needs to be healed.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Am I getting my point across? The mind
[45:24] is a there isn't anybody here that fully
[45:27] understands the mind. I don't think any
[45:28] human understands the mind. They can
[45:31] study it and dissect it and make all
[45:32] kinds of volumes of books on it, but
[45:34] they don't fully understand the mind.
[45:37] But God has a remedy for the mind. My
[45:40] peace give I unto you. Not as the world
[45:42] give it, but I give you peace.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Each of these is almost a message within
[45:51] itself. the passions, the desires,
[45:55] the appetites,
[45:58] the affections
[46:00] come to heal them.
[46:03] As I said a few moments ago,
[46:06] this is a very very self centered
[46:10] generation.
[46:12] our society, the way things are, the
[46:16] availability of the good, what they call
[46:18] the good life
[46:20] that sucks us in as it were to the
[46:23] vortex of what I want, what where I want
[46:28] to go, who I want to be with, who I
[46:32] love, who I think I love.
[46:35] uh entering into a marriage. How many
[46:39] marriages fell apart cuz I didn't get
[46:42] what I thought. This isn't what I got
[46:44] married for. My body coming here to
[46:48] church with this on my mind. I see them
[46:51] jogging.
[46:53] They're not in the house of God like you
[46:54] are.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; It's my body.
[46:58] Saw a great big sign. Flea market today.
[47:02] the man. Do you know what? I personally
[47:05] went to a person's place and picked up
[47:07] all of Brother Brandham's tapes. And he
[47:09] is the very man that started the Sunday
[47:11] flea market,
[47:15] listening to all of these tapes, what to
[47:18] do for him. And I thought of all this
[47:20] crowd now in a flea market, a man that
[47:24] once professed, never never did never
[47:26] did have it, never did grasp it as far
[47:28] as I was concerned, but once professed
[47:31] that he believed that God sent a prophet
[47:33] and had all of Brother Brandham's tapes
[47:35] and finally called me and said I could
[47:37] have them.
[47:38] Started the flea market. I saw the sign
[47:41] this morning with this on my mind and I
[47:44] thought, you know
[47:46] what? What are they at the flea market
[47:48] for? For someone else? No, it's me.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; I want to go to the flea market. I want
[47:54] to look and see what I can do. What
[47:56] about my entertainment? The kind of
[47:58] thing that tickles me, the kind of thing
[48:00] that I enjoy, the kind of food that I
[48:02] like.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Hey, the kind of car I want to drive,
[48:06] the kind of home I want to live in. And
[48:09] then pretty soon you're just sucked into
[48:11] a vortex
[48:13] of self-gratification
[48:16] &gt;&gt; and getting things better, getting
[48:17] things easier and doing things and it's
[48:20] all my me. I want to reverse that today.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; I want to reverse that. And that's what
[48:27] this whole service is about. And you
[48:29] might as well sit back and take your
[48:31] time because I'm going to deliver this
[48:34] message to you.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[48:40] the desires, the appetites, the
[48:43] affections, the purposes, our endeavors,
[48:48] our understanding,
[48:50] the seed of our intelligence,
[48:53] and the will and the character of the
[48:55] soul. All of these can be affected and
[48:58] stirred in either a good way or a bad
[49:01] way. And we're now moving in a direction
[49:05] that'll be stirred in a good way.
[49:09] So he spoke of the wounded.
[49:12] I spoke of the wounded a week ago
[49:14] Wednesday
[49:16] and and I was very very open with you
[49:19] and that's why I didn't want it to go
[49:20] any further. I've spent my life almost
[49:25] my entire life from a young married man
[49:29] to the native Indian people.
[49:33] I thought of brother Brennan in one of
[49:36] the quotes I'm coming to here. He said
[49:38] he he was had been in the ministry just
[49:40] coming up to 31 years. He said when you
[49:43] get older you start thinking back over
[49:45] your life. And I thought of my
[49:49] uh some of the back that's one advantage
[49:51] with getting up at the at my end of the
[49:53] road. You can afford to look back. And I
[49:56] thought of my young wife and three
[49:59] little children in a tiny home in
[50:02] Victoria. But whenever the native Indian
[50:05] people came off the reservation,
[50:08] it was our home that was always open.
[50:10] They slept in our basement. Uh we tended
[50:14] to the, you know, sometimes fleas and
[50:16] bed bugs and so on. After that never
[50:19] changed anything. They always stayed in
[50:22] our home, ate our food. My wife did the
[50:25] cooking. We never thought we're going to
[50:27] do good for somebody,
[50:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[50:29] &gt;&gt; This is just a thing to do.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; There's nothing else to do. Or someone
[50:34] is in need or whatever. You can't live
[50:37] to yourself.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; You young couples cannot afford to live
[50:42] to yourself.
[50:44] my home and my little thing and where
[50:47] I'm going and what I'm doing. I can tell
[50:50] you you'll get to the end of the road
[50:52] and there'll be zero reward for that.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; I'm laying it I'm I'm coming to
[51:02] everybody's address.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; And the reason I can come to it is and
[51:07] I'm not ashamed to say I've been there,
[51:10] &gt;&gt; been there, done that.
[51:15] the gospel
[51:17] that we have. Now, this is going to take
[51:19] a few twists and turns. That's why I'm
[51:20] going to go carefully with you. The
[51:23] gospel, which I refer to the message of
[51:25] the hour,
[51:27] has the remedy
[51:29] for the wounded
[51:31] &gt;&gt; and the brokenhearted.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; You have the remedy.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; And God help us if we withhold that
[51:38] remedy.
[51:40] We cannot afford to withhold it. We've
[51:43] got to be able to find a way to be to
[51:47] just give it out. Now,
[51:51] uh in the Thotyron church age, Brother
[51:53] Bram says this.
[51:55] He's quoting the scripture, I will put
[51:57] upon you none other burden. The word for
[52:01] burden is the weight or pressure. and
[52:04] the pressure of the dark ages was either
[52:07] bend or be broken. Now, I know you've
[52:10] all heard this quote before, but I want
[52:13] you to hear it again in context with the
[52:16] whole service.
[52:18] And to put emphasis on the fact that it
[52:20] wasn't a preacher that preached it, it
[52:22] was a prophet that spoke it. And he said
[52:25] it was uh in the Inquisition the power
[52:28] of the empire back backing up satanic
[52:31] worship
[52:33] and to be organized or pay with your
[52:35] life. Each age had its pressures. For
[52:40] example, a great burden of the last age
[52:43] is the pressure of riches.
[52:46] There's pressure
[52:48] of riches. The world's understanding a
[52:51] wee bit of it now. What they call a
[52:53] meltdown. The only reason they can call
[52:55] it a meltdown is because they thought
[52:58] they had something before it melted
[53:00] down.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; They had what did they have? Stocks and
[53:05] bonds and well, let's face it, riches.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; That's what it was. Riches. Oh, I made
[53:11] so much or my property went up or or it
[53:14] did this and so on. That's riches.
[53:16] That's what it is. And I thought they
[53:19] had it and now it's a bit of a meltdown
[53:21] and everybody's disappointed.
[53:22] Everybody's discouraged and people are
[53:24] in the doldrums and so on. But he said
[53:28] there's pressure with riches.
[53:32] For example, a great burden is the
[53:34] pressure of riches. Secondly, soft
[53:37] living and nervous tensions. I tell you
[53:41] what, brother Brandham covered the whole
[53:43] age in those three statements. riches,
[53:46] soft living, and nervous tensions in a
[53:52] complex age. It's a complex age that we
[53:56] seem unfitted to live in.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; I say amen to that.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; I don't feel fitted to live in it at
[54:02] all.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; I feel as a I feel like a foreigner.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; And like Marilyn's song,
[54:09] I don't feel welcome here anymore.
[54:13] Amen.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; I don't want to feel welcome.
[54:19] I don't want to feel a welcome spirit
[54:21] from the world. You're one of us. No,
[54:23] I'm not one of us. I'm not one of them.
[54:25] I'm one of I'm one of these.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Called out ones.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; And the fourth age seems to have had a
[54:33] clear-cut burden. It was to defy Rome,
[54:37] stand up for the word even unto death.
[54:40] All right. So now the gospel is the
[54:43] remedy. So we've come that far. I'd like
[54:45] to have had slide but I didn't have time
[54:47] to prepare all of that. So the gospel
[54:51] for this day is the remedy for the
[54:54] situation for whatever need we might
[54:56] have. Secondly, that gospel is to be
[55:00] preached and it's to be preached not in
[55:02] word only but also in power. I so
[55:06] enjoyed brother Lance your message as
[55:10] you took your burden of your heart and
[55:13] it was certainly a burden of my heart.
[55:15] We don't want to just you know have
[55:18] messages or have sermons. We want to
[55:21] have services where things are taking
[55:24] place, where the word is delivered out
[55:27] to the people and faith comes into your
[55:30] hearts and something happens.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Something takes place. If you're not
[55:36] saved, you get saved.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; You get convicted. If you're not
[55:40] baptized, you become baptized. Not
[55:42] because somebody says so or somebody
[55:44] pounds you with it, but that you have a
[55:46] conviction within your own heart.
[55:50] If if we don't act exactly right, we
[55:53] don't speak right or we don't have the
[55:55] right relationship between husband and
[55:57] wife, then it becomes right
[55:59] &gt;&gt; by the power of the word.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Do we believe that?
[56:04] &gt;&gt; The young people, our actions, our
[56:07] desires for whatever kind of uh thing we
[56:10] fill our lives with uh entertainment or
[56:14] how we dress. We should have an inner
[56:16] conviction. Not because someone stands
[56:18] behind the pulpit and preaches a
[56:20] closline doctrine. You should have the
[56:23] closline doctrine in your soul. It's up
[56:26] to you to have it because you know you
[56:29] if you have the Holy Spirit, the Holy
[56:31] Spirit isn't going to have you run on
[56:33] the streets and be and and be held
[56:36] responsible uh for for as brother
[56:39] Brandham says, you might be pure as a
[56:41] lily, but you stand before God as a
[56:43] prostitute if you dress in a certain way
[56:46] to cause cause people or cause men to
[56:49] look after and lust after you. And so I
[56:51] say modesty is a is a key word with the
[56:55] Holy Spirit. That's what the scripture
[56:57] teaches. Modest and dress.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Modest in our our actions. Do you
[57:02] believe that?
[57:04] &gt;&gt; And some somebody comes up with a I
[57:06] won't call it a lame excuse, but it's
[57:08] it's got a heavy limp in it.
[57:12] And that is I don't know how to sew. And
[57:14] that's the only thing they make. Well,
[57:16] you know what? If you need if you want
[57:18] to be an accountant, you know what you
[57:19] do? You go and learn how to do books. If
[57:22] you want to learn to sew, then you learn
[57:24] to go and go and find out somebody to
[57:26] teach you how to sew. We got some
[57:28] wonderful seamstresses here in this
[57:30] place. And and I I think it's just
[57:31] wonderful. Well, and and you say, "Well,
[57:34] I might be on dangerous territory." I
[57:36] don't think it's dangerous at all.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; I raised three girls.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; And I don't like to see them wearing
[57:45] some overgrown sock.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Somebody says, "I'm getting old. I see
[57:54] so many girls wearing socks."
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about skin tight.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; And as far as I'm concerned, that is
[58:06] skin tight. Amen.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; And I believe in and if you want to know
[58:10] what modesty is, we can give you the
[58:12] give you a picture of the lovely young
[58:14] ladies in in the Ukraine and how they
[58:16] were beautifully dressed and modestly
[58:18] dressed. And this congregation ought to
[58:20] be roaring an amen.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; To preach the gospel. All right.
[58:28] Sure enough, I'm going to need my watch
[58:30] out here on the table
[58:34] in the message. Queen of Sheba. Brother
[58:37] Brandon speaks about the commission. The
[58:39] commission was go into all the world and
[58:40] preach the gospel. Preaching the gospel
[58:43] was to demonstrate the power. He said it
[58:46] had to be. What's the next verse say?
[58:48] That these signs shall follow them that
[58:51] believe. He said the manifestation, the
[58:54] demonstration
[58:56] are the works are the works out of the
[58:59] word made positive. Are the works out of
[59:03] the word made positive? That is the
[59:06] manifestation, demonstration. And listen
[59:08] to this now. When the word is preached,
[59:11] signs of the word confirms the word to
[59:14] the true to be true. If it doesn't, it
[59:18] doesn't come from the heart of faith. It
[59:20] doesn't anchor in the heart of faith.
[59:23] Did not Jesus say that some seed some
[59:26] seed uh some swed seeds and when it did
[59:30] it fell by the wayside and the birds
[59:32] gathered it. Some went in stony ground
[59:35] and the riches of the earth choked them
[59:37] out like briars and so forth. And didn't
[59:40] he say some went over and brought forth
[59:43] a hundfold? You must first let the word
[59:47] fall in the right type of faith. And
[59:49] this is I have underlined. And then that
[59:52] faith produces what the word said
[59:58] &gt;&gt; because the word is a seed and the word
[1:00:01] of God right here is a seed that a swer
[1:00:05] sws and every seed will produce its kind
[1:00:10] if it's put in the right atmospheres and
[1:00:13] the right condition. The seed will
[1:00:16] produce it.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. in a in a message exhortation of
[1:00:22] healing and the gospel came uh the
[1:00:26] gospel never came by word only but
[1:00:27] through the power and demonstration of
[1:00:29] the Holy Spirit. I believe that.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; And that is what we ought to expect.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; That is what we must expect.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; It does not come in word only but in
[1:00:42] power and demonstration of the Holy
[1:00:44] Spirit. So he said, "So it's to
[1:00:46] demonstrate the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:49] in our lives."
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; In our lives, uh probably a good number
[1:00:54] of people here within the sound of my
[1:00:56] voice, you may well have something that
[1:00:59] you've struggled with and over a period
[1:01:03] of years or a period of time, I want to
[1:01:07] announce to you the power of the spoken
[1:01:10] word. If it's received, if you say
[1:01:13] today, I believe that and I believe it's
[1:01:16] for me.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; That thing you have struggled with will
[1:01:21] be broken.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; You may have to you may have to battle
[1:01:26] something tomorrow, but you're on your
[1:01:29] way to victory.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; It's a it's a spiritual illness that
[1:01:34] will be conquered by the word
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; one step at a time. Hallelujah.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; I'm looking down and seeing in the faces
[1:01:44] of people, you're sitting right here and
[1:01:46] I've seen you come to more glorious
[1:01:48] victory from being steadfast, being
[1:01:52] absolutely adamant, this promise is
[1:01:55] mine. And if regardless of what the
[1:01:58] battle is, regardless what the struggle
[1:02:00] is, if this thing is not going to
[1:02:03] conquer me, by the word of God, by the
[1:02:06] promises which are yay and amen, by the
[1:02:08] Holy Ghost that's present, by my
[1:02:10] yieldedness and giving the word first
[1:02:12] place in my life, I will conquer this.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; It shall not impede my spiritual walk.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; It shall not hinder me. It shall not
[1:02:23] conquer me. It shall not dictate to my
[1:02:26] life.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And by the acting upon
[1:02:35] your faith in God for divine healing and
[1:02:39] other things and other things and he
[1:02:42] calls it redemptive blessings." The
[1:02:44] redemptive blessings believe belong to
[1:02:47] us. Then brother Brandham speaks about
[1:02:49] the healing of the soul. Because now you
[1:02:53] that have played the tapes and heard the
[1:02:55] messages and read them over the years,
[1:02:58] you'll have to agree with me that most
[1:03:01] of the people perhaps 90ome percent of
[1:03:04] the people maybe 95 or 98% of the people
[1:03:09] came before that gift and before that
[1:03:12] pillar fire and before that prophet for
[1:03:15] a physical benefit.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Right? Amen.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; And that really is sad
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; because no doubt the biggest percentage
[1:03:26] of those people also had a spiritual
[1:03:30] need
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; and some came a preacher came says you
[1:03:37] desire a revival in your church.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; That was wonderful.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; It wasn't for himself it was for his
[1:03:44] church. Amen.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; So healing of the soul, he says, and not
[1:03:48] only the healing of the body, but
[1:03:50] healing of the soul also, which is far
[1:03:53] more essential than healing of the body.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; We have all kinds of afflictions. I can
[1:03:59] feel a pain or two as I stand here.
[1:04:02] That's irrelevant to me right now. I'm
[1:04:05] interested in the spiritual benefit of
[1:04:08] the people of our congregations.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. of the bride of Jesus Christ on a
[1:04:15] large large scale.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; So healing of the soul and that could be
[1:04:20] a whole a whole message within itself.
[1:04:25] He speaks of Isaac that said to Abraham
[1:04:30] uh behold the fire and the wood but
[1:04:32] where's the lamb for the burnt offering?
[1:04:35] Brother Brandon goes on. He says, "Now
[1:04:36] in the book of Hebrews, Paul speaking in
[1:04:39] the 11th chapter 40th verse, and God
[1:04:42] having provided some better thing for
[1:04:45] us." He says, "Now I wish to take this
[1:04:47] my thought on God providing healing for
[1:04:50] this generation." He says, "Being our
[1:04:53] services are mostly devoted to divine
[1:04:56] healing." Then he says healing of the
[1:04:59] soul and healing of the body.
[1:05:04] Salvation of the soul
[1:05:06] and salvation is a deliverance but also
[1:05:10] a welfare and prosperity.
[1:05:13] I would that you would prosper
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; in soul. Your soul prospers.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; That is really what the intent is here.
[1:05:22] And to be saved, to have salvation is to
[1:05:26] be liberated,
[1:05:28] to be victorious.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Oh my. If I could just make my point
[1:05:34] here this morning, God does not intend
[1:05:38] that you should live under some uh uh
[1:05:42] under some affliction.
[1:05:45] If if I could believe that God intended
[1:05:47] we live under physical affliction, I
[1:05:50] couldn't preach divine healing. I don't
[1:05:52] believe that it's God's will for us to
[1:05:55] be afflicted
[1:05:56] physically, but much more intense is it
[1:06:00] the will of God that you be free
[1:06:02] spiritually.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; And it's Satan wants to bind people,
[1:06:07] bind our faith so it can't be released.
[1:06:10] God wants to release your faith
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; to believe for all things are possible
[1:06:17] to him or her that believeth. And we're
[1:06:20] sons and daughters of God. And our
[1:06:22] heavenly father, he he's not our father
[1:06:24] to fail us. He's our father to fulfill
[1:06:27] his word. And he delights in fulfilling
[1:06:30] it. He wants to fulfill it.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; That's why we praise him and glorify
[1:06:36] him. And it's to save us from moral
[1:06:39] troubles. Salvation is uh is not only
[1:06:43] deliverance, health, preservation. It's
[1:06:45] all of these things, but it's also to be
[1:06:48] saved from the molestation of the enemy.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; An enemy is not allowed to molest us.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; He can do all kinds of things. He can
[1:06:58] roar around and and try to afflict us,
[1:07:01] but we if we we just want to rise up and
[1:07:04] say, "I'm going to be part of a
[1:07:05] congregation. I'm going to contribute to
[1:07:08] this congregation. I'm going to
[1:07:09] contribute faith.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; I'm going to contribute to positive word
[1:07:14] of God. I'm going to contribute the
[1:07:16] promises by speaking it, by singing
[1:07:19] about it, by living it. I'm not going to
[1:07:22] I'm not going to confess a negative
[1:07:25] aspect. I'm not going to give Satan any
[1:07:27] credit whatsoever.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to just take a a slight turn
[1:07:37] here. Stay with me. I want to speak for
[1:07:41] a few moments on the ministry of Joseph
[1:07:45] in the Old Testament and the ministry of
[1:07:48] Boaz. Those two for a specific reason
[1:07:52] because it ties completely and perfectly
[1:07:55] into the message today.
[1:07:58] Both of them have very important
[1:08:01] similarities.
[1:08:04] Joseph
[1:08:06] and Boaz,
[1:08:09] they both at the climax of their
[1:08:12] ministry, I call it their ministry,
[1:08:13] their life, they both were a perfect
[1:08:17] type of Jesus Christ.
[1:08:20] Joseph's family became destitute.
[1:08:26] Joseph's family
[1:08:28] had a lot of infighting
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; and struggle between the brothers
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; and pointing a finger of who was to
[1:08:36] blame for the things that were taking
[1:08:38] place.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Both came into a famine. Their family
[1:08:43] came into a famine. and the family of
[1:08:47] Naomi and Ruth and IMC and the husbands
[1:08:52] of the of the girls all came into a
[1:08:56] famine. We can sit here and I can say
[1:08:58] some a few words, but it does not even
[1:09:02] begin to do justice to the years
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; of spiritual drought,
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; the sorrow,
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; the grief,
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; the darkness at night,
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; being without a husband, and being
[1:09:19] destitute
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; of having as Ruth as Naomi did, going
[1:09:23] out full and coming back empty,
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; And of Joseph's family,
[1:09:30] a a patriarch
[1:09:33] that was declared by God,
[1:09:37] you'll be blessed.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; And to think that he's in that destitute
[1:09:42] condition, how can I say that I'm
[1:09:44] blessed? Where's the God of my fathers
[1:09:47] Abraham and Isaac?
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; This is not the way it was supposed to
[1:09:52] be. And they it seemed like everything
[1:09:54] was in reverse.
[1:09:56] And Joseph
[1:09:58] he raised up to a a position in Egypt.
[1:10:02] But this is what he said.
[1:10:05] Joseph said to his brethren, "Haste ye
[1:10:10] and go up to my father." this in the
[1:10:13] midst of his meetings with them. And say
[1:10:16] unto him, thus saith thy son Joseph,
[1:10:21] God hath made me lord
[1:10:24] of all Egypt. Come down unto me and tar
[1:10:28] not. And thou shalt dwell in a land of
[1:10:32] Gan, and thou shalt be near unto me,
[1:10:36] thou and thy children, and thy
[1:10:38] children's children, and thy flocks, and
[1:10:42] thy herds, and all that thou hast. And
[1:10:46] there I will nourish thee. Amen.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; For yet there are five years of famine,
[1:10:58] lest thou in thy household and all that
[1:11:01] thou hast come to poverty.
[1:11:05] And in the 50th chapter of Genesis,
[1:11:08] Joseph speaking again, and now therefore
[1:11:10] fear ye not. He's saying to his
[1:11:13] brothers,
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; I will nourish you and your little ones.
[1:11:19] and he comforted them and spake kindly
[1:11:23] unto them. That has been replicated
[1:11:27] again in the message and the ministry of
[1:11:31] of the prophet of God in this day.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; We've come to a place the generation
[1:11:37] that come to a place into utter
[1:11:39] spiritual poverty.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; And it's evident everywhere.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Talk about denominations. We haven't got
[1:11:45] time to talk about them. Talk about
[1:11:47] Pentecost. We haven't got time to talk
[1:11:49] about it. They got their programs and
[1:11:52] all of the things and the schemes and
[1:11:54] all of their e educated intelligence and
[1:11:57] and all the all the theology. It's come
[1:12:00] to nothing.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; It's evident it's come to nothing. It
[1:12:06] has produced nothing in the people. The
[1:12:08] people have ended up being in widowhood.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; No seed has been given her. She can't
[1:12:14] bring forth the son of God. Amen.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Said, "And I will nourish thee." And to
[1:12:24] nourish
[1:12:26] is almost like bind.
[1:12:29] Says uh to seize.
[1:12:32] In other words, Joseph is saying, "I've
[1:12:35] come down and I'm going to seize this
[1:12:38] situation
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; because I'm in seizing it. I'm going to
[1:12:42] bind it. I'm going to restrict it. It
[1:12:45] will have no more effect upon my elect.
[1:12:48] I'm going to bring it to an end.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Are you getting my point? Are you
[1:12:53] getting the connection? I'm going to
[1:12:55] cause this to cease now. This is not
[1:12:58] going to have any more power upon my
[1:13:00] children, upon my sons, and upon my
[1:13:03] daughters.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; I am going to nourish them.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; And the second part of that is I'm going
[1:13:09] to strengthen them. I'm going to loose
[1:13:11] them. I'm going to do what's necessary
[1:13:14] for them.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; I want you to bring it to this service.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; God, bring an end.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; I release myself to you in a full
[1:13:27] yieldedness. I say no to the enemy. I
[1:13:30] say no to Satan. I say no to those
[1:13:33] suggestions that enter into my mind. I'm
[1:13:36] done with them.
[1:13:37] And if you will do that this morning,
[1:13:39] I'm saying to you on the basis of God's
[1:13:41] word, on the basis of the burden of the
[1:13:43] word in my heart, that will come to an
[1:13:45] end.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go up and down.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; You don't have to come through these
[1:13:52] dark spells anymore.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; You don't have to have it. God has come
[1:13:57] down in this generation and has seized
[1:14:00] taken a hold of the situation and say,
[1:14:03] "It's over.
[1:14:08] That's not just some excitement in my
[1:14:09] part. Otherwise, Revelation 10:1 doesn't
[1:14:12] mean anything.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; He didn't come down just to give us
[1:14:16] another church or give us another little
[1:14:18] way to believe. He come down to say this
[1:14:20] this situation's come to an end.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; And if you're an elect of God, God has
[1:14:27] seized upon that situation. And it's
[1:14:31] such a such a myriad of situations, but
[1:14:34] you know, you know in your heart when
[1:14:36] it's not from the kingdom of light,
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; you know it's a dark cloud. You know
[1:14:41] it's from the enemy.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; I want you to declare today God has
[1:14:46] brought a sessation to it. He's seized
[1:14:48] it. He's restrained it. He said it's
[1:14:50] done.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; And if you accept that,
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; you'll walk out of these doors different
[1:14:58] than when you walked in. And I'm not
[1:15:00] studying. These brothers aren't studying
[1:15:02] and pouring out their heart as the
[1:15:04] messages I've heard recently. They
[1:15:06] haven't done that. That's been God to
[1:15:08] you people.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Has no right. Has no right to your mind.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Has no right to your soul.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; And has no right to your body.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; But you have to accept it. And that's
[1:15:25] what the prophet was saying. If the seed
[1:15:27] is received in faith, if it's just
[1:15:29] received on stony ground, the birds are
[1:15:32] going to have it before you get home.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; If you're in love with riches, if you're
[1:15:37] in love with your business, if you're in
[1:15:39] love with your your own life, me me,
[1:15:41] then the cares of this world and the
[1:15:44] deceitfulness of riches will choke it
[1:15:46] out
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; and it will bear no fruit,
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; and you'll end up exactly where you have
[1:15:52] been.
[1:15:53] Yes.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; But if you say, "I receive it.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; I open up my heart. There's no part of
[1:16:00] my soul that I reserve." Oh God, have
[1:16:03] full control. Have full control as of
[1:16:06] this moment. I receive that as my pastor
[1:16:09] speaking your word. And I believe it's
[1:16:12] for this service today. And I'm not here
[1:16:15] by accident. I'm here by design.
[1:16:19] [Music]
[1:16:19] [Applause]
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; You'll receive it. you'll have it.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Don't sit in this service and ignore it.
[1:16:29] Don't sit here and ignore it. It'll be
[1:16:32] worse.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; But if you say, "I accept it. I receive
[1:16:38] it on my behalf. I'm prepared to change.
[1:16:41] I'm prepared to hear the word of God and
[1:16:44] the Holy Spirit speaking in my soul."
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; One thing about his voice is persistent.
[1:16:51] Amen.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; He'll say the same thing all the time.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; And you don't have to have a big flash
[1:16:59] of lightning here.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is do business with
[1:17:03] God.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Come to a quiet or loud. It doesn't
[1:17:07] matter to me. But come to a resolve
[1:17:09] within your soul. This thing is going to
[1:17:13] change. I've committed it to God. And
[1:17:15] I'm going to go out of these doors
[1:17:17] different. And I will not forget what I
[1:17:19] have heard.
[1:17:21] I will be quoting that and repeating
[1:17:23] that day after day after day.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; So the ministry of Joseph,
[1:17:31] I will nourish thee. I will seize and
[1:17:34] contain this thing. And second part of
[1:17:39] that, I will
[1:17:42] sustain you. It's going to seize and
[1:17:45] take control of the situation that it
[1:17:47] can't advance any further. Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; That Satan cannot use that to bring that
[1:17:54] evil difficulty upon you. One thing
[1:17:57] about evil, one thing about wrong, one
[1:17:59] thing about corruption, one thing about
[1:18:01] darkness, one thing about all of that
[1:18:03] from the kingdom of of Satan, if you
[1:18:06] don't take a definite step against it,
[1:18:08] it will continue to creep in.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; It will continue to take dominance.
[1:18:18] If you start to feel cool in your
[1:18:20] spiritual life, if you don't deal with
[1:18:23] that, you will not get warmer.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; You'll get coldermen.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; If you ignore the voice of God,
[1:18:34] your spiritual fellowship and walk with
[1:18:36] God will not become more blessed and
[1:18:39] wonderful.
[1:18:41] It'll become less and less.
[1:18:44] And if you don't really enjoy the
[1:18:46] service and enjoy the fellowship and
[1:18:48] enjoy the worship and enjoy the house of
[1:18:51] God, if you feel a twinge of, you know,
[1:18:54] just being casual about things, attack
[1:18:57] that.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Attack that with a vicious with a
[1:19:01] vicious attitude. Say, Satan,
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; whether I don't feel anything or not,
[1:19:07] this is not
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; going to continue.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:14] might say, "What kind of advice can you
[1:19:15] give me, brother Ed?" I I'll give you
[1:19:17] this advice that David said, he said, "I
[1:19:20] said to my soul,
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; David speaking to his own soul,
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; praise ye the Lord."
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; He was commanding his own soul. You
[1:19:31] praise the Lord.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of praise.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Now, do I feel like it?"
[1:19:38] Has nothing to do with how you feel like
[1:19:39] it. It's what's right. And what's right
[1:19:41] is he deserves it.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; He deserves it and you need to give it.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Take control of the situation.
[1:20:02] He says, "Therefore, I will nourish you
[1:20:05] and comfort."
[1:20:08] He'll take control of the adverse
[1:20:09] conditions,
[1:20:11] contain them, and reverse them.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; That's what nourish really has to do.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Provide provisions, food, and sustenance
[1:20:21] than you, more than you even need. Is
[1:20:25] Jehovah Gyra. Amen.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Joseph had more than his brother and his
[1:20:30] father and all of their families needed.
[1:20:32] He had more.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Boaz had more grain than Ruth and Naomi
[1:20:38] together and all of their people could
[1:20:40] ever eat.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; He had more fields. He had more wealth.
[1:20:44] He had more everything than they could
[1:20:46] ever possibly need.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; They could ever God has more this
[1:20:50] morning than you could ever need.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; There's more bread. There's more
[1:20:56] revelation on this word than you can
[1:20:58] ever assimilate. You won't live long
[1:21:01] enough.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; The longer you live, the more you'll
[1:21:05] realize how little you know. Oh God,
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; give me capacity.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Help me to understand.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Give me revelation and revelation.
[1:21:18] Amen.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; I think now
[1:21:23] returning as Naomi was
[1:21:26] in her grief and her stricken condition
[1:21:30] and she said, "Call me not Naomi.
[1:21:34] Call me Mara, for the Almighty hath
[1:21:37] dealt very bitterly with me.
[1:21:41] I went out full, and the Lord hath
[1:21:44] brought me home again empty." Why then
[1:21:47] call me Naomi, seeing the Lord hath
[1:21:50] testified against me, and the Almighty
[1:21:53] hath afflicted me. So that was her
[1:21:56] wounded situation.
[1:22:00] She had no knowledge
[1:22:03] that Boaz was going. Now watch, please
[1:22:06] you that are spiritual and know the
[1:22:09] message.
[1:22:12] This also
[1:22:14] the lives of Jo Joseph and his brethren
[1:22:17] and his father were playing out a
[1:22:20] prophecy.
[1:22:22] The lives of Naomi and Ruth and Boaz
[1:22:27] were living out a prophecy.
[1:22:30] And that prophecy
[1:22:32] had a fulfillment in our time
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; because as Boaz came to the field to do
[1:22:41] the redemptive work, so did the son of
[1:22:44] man in Revelation five and in
[1:22:47] Revelation. In Revelation five, he stood
[1:22:50] up and took the book. That was his
[1:22:52] action there. Boaz's action was coming
[1:22:56] to the field which was descending to the
[1:22:58] world.
[1:23:00] Also in Revelation 10, the mighty angel
[1:23:04] which was none other. We say it was Boaz
[1:23:06] or Joseph or the mighty angel or the
[1:23:09] lamb that stood up. It's all synonymous.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; It's all the same. All the same person.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; And a mighty angel descending and the
[1:23:18] prophet saying it's clear. It's Christ.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; He's coming to the earth in the end
[1:23:23] time.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; And he's coming to a maiden,
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; a gentile maiden.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And here we are
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; and you are part of that
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; gentile maiden
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; coming to take her as a bride. All
[1:23:38] reapers were in the field. All kinds of
[1:23:39] people working in the gospel. But he had
[1:23:42] his eye only on one. And he says to the
[1:23:45] servant singular who was over all the
[1:23:48] harvest which is none other than the
[1:23:50] prophet messenger this day. And he said
[1:23:52] to him, "Who is this maiden?"
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; And he says, "This is the gentile. This
[1:23:57] is the Moabitetish girl.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; That is here. And from that time on, the
[1:24:03] the servant the servant passes off the
[1:24:06] scene. You never hear of him again.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; And all you hear of is
[1:24:12] Boaz and Ruth.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; And now she becomes his wife.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Now listen to this.
[1:24:23] So Boaz took Ruth,
[1:24:26] and he was and she was his wife.
[1:24:30] And when he went in unto her, the Lord
[1:24:32] gave her conception, and she bare a son.
[1:24:37] She had had a husband, but had no
[1:24:39] conception.
[1:24:42] And the w and the women the woman said
[1:24:45] unto Naomi, "Blessed be the Lord." Now
[1:24:48] the women are speaking to Naomi. Blessed
[1:24:51] be the Lord which hath not left thee
[1:24:54] this day without a kinsman. Now they're
[1:24:56] speaking to Naomi. And his name may be
[1:25:00] famous in Israel.
[1:25:02] And he shall be unto thee a restorer of
[1:25:06] thy life. Number one, and a nourisher of
[1:25:10] thine old age.
[1:25:12] For the daughter-in-law,
[1:25:16] which loveth thee, which is better to
[1:25:18] thee than seven sons, hath borne him.
[1:25:24] So, she's speaking now. They're speaking
[1:25:26] of the child that will be born of Ruth
[1:25:33] and he shall be they're referring to
[1:25:36] Boaz of course because both you can't
[1:25:39] separate either one of them because
[1:25:42] here's Boaz as a man in a husband form
[1:25:47] and his seed is in her in a child form.
[1:25:53] Oed
[1:25:55] who will bear begget Jesse who begat
[1:25:58] David. So the very tribe the very lion
[1:26:04] of the tribe of Judah
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; is coming forth
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; from the womb
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; of Ruth.
[1:26:12] And so when they say he will be a
[1:26:15] nourisher that
[1:26:18] that which is born of Ruth, they're not
[1:26:21] making any separation because she goes
[1:26:24] on to say, "And he shall be unto thee."
[1:26:28] says, "And the women said to Naomi,
[1:26:30] blessed be the Lord, which hath not left
[1:26:33] thee this day without a kinsman, the
[1:26:36] kinsman being Boaz,
[1:26:39] that his name may be famous in Israel.
[1:26:43] And he shall be unto thee a ner a
[1:26:46] restorer
[1:26:48] of thy life, and a nourisher of thine
[1:26:52] old age.
[1:26:54] For thy daughter-in-law,
[1:26:56] which loveth thee, which is better to
[1:26:59] thee than seven sons, hath borne him.
[1:27:04] Well, the daughter-in-law, Ruth, did not
[1:27:06] bear
[1:27:08] the kinsman,
[1:27:10] but she bore the kinsman's son.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; It said, "And he will nourish you
[1:27:19] and he will restore you." Now you cannot
[1:27:23] it's synonymous
[1:27:25] the kinsman or the kinsman's
[1:27:28] seed which brought forth.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; We can say I could put it this way the
[1:27:33] kinsman
[1:27:35] Boaz the person was a restorer of life
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; to to Naomi
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; and a nourisher in her old age. But that
[1:27:46] which came from him which which was Oed
[1:27:51] Jesse and David and Matthew 1:1 Jesus
[1:27:55] Christ the son of David that's him
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; who was a nourisher in Joseph's time
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; and was a nourisher in Boaz in Ruth and
[1:28:07] Naomi's time and is a nourisher and a b
[1:28:12] a restorer in your time.
[1:28:15] Hallelujah.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; He's the same one.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; And the beautiful thing is he's a
[1:28:22] restorer. Beautiful. Beautiful.
[1:28:25] Beautiful. Restorer. That is to turn
[1:28:28] back or to give back. Do you know when
[1:28:31] the last time that word is used in the
[1:28:33] Old Testament?
[1:28:35] Malachi 4 and six. He shall turn back.
[1:28:40] Amen.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; He'll be a restorer unto you.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; You believe the prophecy of Malachi.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; You believe it with all your heart.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; That prophecy came to fulfillment in
[1:28:52] your life.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; It's effective today.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Receive it.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Receive it. It's effective this moment.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Without limit,
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; without restraint.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All things are possible to
[1:29:11] them that believe. If you sit here in
[1:29:13] the service and just sit for a sermon,
[1:29:15] you're losing the whole thing. But if
[1:29:17] you sit here and say, "I receive that.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; I receive that from the mouth of God.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; You'll receive the benefit of it."
[1:29:27] You'll go out those two wooden doors or
[1:29:29] these other two different than when you
[1:29:32] came in.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in power and demonstration
[1:29:38] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; What would you ask of him? Ask it and
[1:29:45] receive it.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Glory. I want to see the services break
[1:29:54] loose
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; because of what's happening in the seat.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; I want to see people delivered as they
[1:30:00] listen to the word.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; That word is none other than Jesus
[1:30:04] Christ.
[1:30:06] I'm here in need. I look to him. He's
[1:30:08] the solution.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; This gospel is the remedy.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; This message is the remedy.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Receive it.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; And it's your portion.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the situation is. You
[1:30:21] know, it's not it's not something from
[1:30:23] God. Then be free from it.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Be loosed from it.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Don't live with it any longer.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Boaz is here.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Joseph's God is here. William Brandham's
[1:30:36] God is here.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Elijah's God is here.
[1:30:41] [Music]
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; And I want to hear your testimony. I
[1:30:47] want to receive that email. I want to
[1:30:49] receive that card. I want to hear what
[1:30:51] God is doing in your life. You're going
[1:30:53] to share it with some others.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said to people, "Come,
[1:30:58] come. Why don't you come and see the
[1:31:00] supernatural and it'll increase faith in
[1:31:03] your heart?"
[1:31:04] Amen.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; And God has empowered you now. It's not
[1:31:09] just for you to receive, but it's for
[1:31:11] you to give.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; God has empowered you and left you
[1:31:15] because it is this it is this Christ
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; that is the nourisher.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; And the restorer
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; It's an essential quality of Christ.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; You can never separate it.
[1:31:31] Amen.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; There's a great threat.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; There's a threat
[1:31:42] to
[1:31:44] us stepping forward
[1:31:47] and fulfilling this commission.
[1:31:50] See, I believe this church
[1:31:52] fact is I have good evidence.
[1:31:55] I have an abundant evidence.
[1:31:58] This congregation and this church has
[1:32:02] been raised up by God
[1:32:05] to bind up the brokenhearted.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; It's been a part of my life
[1:32:13] from the very beginning.
[1:32:16] And I personally have a nature.
[1:32:19] If I even come to a a a fellowship, my
[1:32:23] family can tell you, especially my wife.
[1:32:26] Sometimes I come into a room where
[1:32:28] there's been invited and we're having a
[1:32:30] wonderful time and all the rest of it
[1:32:32] and I'm not being able to enter in. I
[1:32:34] can't enter into the wonderful time like
[1:32:37] other people perhaps are and they're,
[1:32:39] you know, jovial and and laughing and so
[1:32:42] on. And I do too, but I'm scanning
[1:32:46] the whole group that's there to see if
[1:32:48] someone's sitting off by themselves
[1:32:51] and nobody's talking to them.
[1:32:54] I go overseas
[1:32:56] even on his last trips
[1:32:58] and there was 27 people having a big
[1:33:02] dinner with the people in Switzerland
[1:33:06] afternoon and oh it was such a wonderful
[1:33:08] time people haven't been together for a
[1:33:10] long time and they were just but while
[1:33:12] we had a little service in a little
[1:33:14] church I identified one young lady
[1:33:18] happened to be the brother who you saw
[1:33:20] in the picture I didn't know who she was
[1:33:23] The brother who you saw who's laying
[1:33:25] right now in the hospital is his
[1:33:27] daughter-in-law
[1:33:29] married to his son.
[1:33:31] I did not know that. But I could see she
[1:33:36] was distant.
[1:33:37] I could see that she was not feeling a
[1:33:41] part of this kind of gathering, this
[1:33:43] meeting. And then all the family and
[1:33:46] other friends and so on end up for
[1:33:48] dinner. I didn't have the same kind of
[1:33:50] enjoyment from the gathering and the
[1:33:53] dinner and so on because my mind was on
[1:33:56] this young woman. Don't know who she is.
[1:33:59] Don't know anything about her.
[1:34:02] You know what that is?
[1:34:05] It's the spirit of Jesus Christ.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; It's essential part
[1:34:12] of him
[1:34:14] wanting to step in.
[1:34:16] Can I say something
[1:34:20] that will bring that will begin to bind
[1:34:26] and take control of the situation that's
[1:34:30] driving her separating her from
[1:34:34] the household of faith my mind and at
[1:34:37] the very end of the day
[1:34:40] at the very end everybody's leaving
[1:34:44] I took her hand to shake her hand and I
[1:34:48] took it
[1:34:50] and she began to tell me that she really
[1:34:53] didn't feel. She said, "I feel very
[1:34:56] hard."
[1:34:58] I said, "Well, maybe
[1:35:00] maybe you're like the woman at the well.
[1:35:04] You've actually
[1:35:06] he's actually near you, but you don't
[1:35:08] know it."
[1:35:10] And she began to soften right away.
[1:35:13] And I was just able to speak. You know
[1:35:14] what that is? Healing ministry.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; You, that's not my ministry. You have
[1:35:22] that healing ministry. All that Christ
[1:35:25] was, he's poured into the bride. Maybe
[1:35:28] you haven't practiced it. Maybe you
[1:35:30] haven't been sensitive to it. I want to
[1:35:32] change that today. Amen.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; I want you to go out of here saying on
[1:35:38] the basis of the message that was
[1:35:40] preached, I have and am part of a
[1:35:44] healing ministry
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; and I have a power resident within me to
[1:35:52] heal
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; the souls and the lives because it's
[1:35:56] Christ in me. It might just be a word I
[1:35:59] say. It might just be a phone call.
[1:36:01] might be I'm not going to speak negative
[1:36:04] things.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to glorify Satan by
[1:36:08] pointing out things that he may be doing
[1:36:10] in somebody's life. I ignore that and I
[1:36:14] will be I will glory God in the things
[1:36:18] that he's doing and I will contribute to
[1:36:21] that by God's grace.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Just another few moments and I'm going
[1:36:29] to close.
[1:36:35] There's a number I'll just say very very
[1:36:38] quickly because I don't want to major on
[1:36:40] this but you know there's a number of
[1:36:42] things if I can just relate for a moment
[1:36:46] from and draw a comparison because from
[1:36:49] the physical to the spiritual do you
[1:36:51] know there's people that are physically
[1:36:53] sick
[1:36:55] but don't know it
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; you've been there
[1:37:00] You weren't well, but you didn't really
[1:37:03] know it. Something was going on in your
[1:37:06] life, in your body, but you didn't know
[1:37:08] it. But actually, you were not well.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; That's number one. Spiritually, it's
[1:37:13] also that way.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Fact is, you can have something going
[1:37:19] sideways, if you understand me. You can
[1:37:22] have something going very, very wrong
[1:37:25] physically in you, and you're still out
[1:37:27] there having a great old time. and
[1:37:29] enjoying life and all the rest. You
[1:37:31] don't realize it that you might be just
[1:37:33] days or weeks away from something that's
[1:37:36] going to attack you and you don't
[1:37:39] realize it. There's people spiritually
[1:37:41] that way. Everything's fine.
[1:37:45] But if they if they had an examination,
[1:37:50] you might say, "Well, how can I have an
[1:37:51] examination?" I'm giving you one today.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; We're having an examination.
[1:37:58] And while the word is preached, I want
[1:38:00] you to listen real real close
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; and see if something is just monitoring
[1:38:06] inside
[1:38:08] by the word.
[1:38:10] And we have an examination
[1:38:12] because we have the physician here.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; We've got him here.
[1:38:20] He's ready to
[1:38:23] fix things. I closed a week ago,
[1:38:26] Wednesday. I said, "How many came here
[1:38:27] wounded?" You don't have to raise your
[1:38:30] hands, but you can.
[1:38:33] And I know a lot of people looked around
[1:38:35] and without any shame, many raised their
[1:38:38] hands.
[1:38:42] And I happen to know because as a
[1:38:44] pastor, I'm well aware.
[1:38:48] And I can even tell you that when
[1:38:50] wounded come in,
[1:38:53] the only thing that a wounded person has
[1:38:56] is their current memory.
[1:39:00] And if they've gone through a very very
[1:39:03] terrible time or a very tearing time or
[1:39:07] a shattering in their life or shattering
[1:39:09] in their home or their family,
[1:39:12] at that moment when they come in, that's
[1:39:14] all they have in their memory. So I I I
[1:39:18] just speak with them and and uh let them
[1:39:21] relate it again and speak about it
[1:39:23] again. They speak about their hurt, they
[1:39:25] speak about their wounds, they speak
[1:39:27] about their grief, speak about their
[1:39:30] sorrow.
[1:39:31] And I have learned that as time goes on,
[1:39:36] then good things, well, they come into
[1:39:39] the house of God. They enjoy the word
[1:39:42] and the fellowship and it feeds them and
[1:39:44] they get strong and they had a wonderful
[1:39:46] time of maybe fellowship with a family
[1:39:49] or other saints. And then I realized
[1:39:51] that now that that
[1:39:55] time that they've had that becomes in
[1:40:00] their current memory. And as time goes
[1:40:03] on, all of that hurt and wounding, it
[1:40:06] starts to eb away.
[1:40:09] And a whole wonderful, glorious walk
[1:40:11] with God becomes their current life.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; And after a period of time, and
[1:40:17] sometimes it's been up to three years,
[1:40:20] and then later at some point in time,
[1:40:22] this is all distant, distant memory. And
[1:40:26] what do you say, brother Ed? I say
[1:40:28] they've been healed.
[1:40:30] They've been healed.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; So wonderful.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about something way off
[1:40:37] in it. They're here,
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Some are sitting beside you.
[1:40:43] They've been healed.
[1:40:45] I'm talking about shattered
[1:40:48] lives.
[1:40:50] I'm talking about people that just about
[1:40:54] didn't recover.
[1:40:59] But I saw God come down.
[1:41:02] [Music]
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; I saw God come down
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; and lay hold of their situation and say
[1:41:08] to Satan, "No more."
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; You don't have them anymore.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; You can't go any further. I'm going to
[1:41:16] bring the restraint. And now I pour in
[1:41:18] the oil and the wine.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; And they come into a healing process.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; And it's so wonderful. I've got to close
[1:41:29] and I got to close with this. There's
[1:41:31] one thing that's a threat.
[1:41:34] There's one thing first I'll say that is
[1:41:36] essential to this ministry of this
[1:41:38] church. That is compassion.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Compassion.
[1:41:46] I want you to think about that word for
[1:41:48] a few moments.
[1:41:51] If a person has compassion,
[1:41:54] you begin to become consumed
[1:41:57] with other person's
[1:42:00] need
[1:42:02] rather than your own life.
[1:42:05] Compassion is something and brother
[1:42:07] Brandham I I'll have to come to it. I
[1:42:10] have to come to it.
[1:42:12] Will you give me a few more minutes?
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:18] There's two very very long quotes. I'm
[1:42:20] not I can't I can't read them. But I was
[1:42:23] touched. I was so touched with I had to
[1:42:24] leave my chair and I had to get on my
[1:42:28] knees
[1:42:30] and weep my own heart out before God.
[1:42:36] But at that day at Calvary, and I'm just
[1:42:39] going to take my time. Is that all right
[1:42:40] for a few minutes?
[1:42:43] He says, "When he died at Calvary," now
[1:42:45] I'm talking about compassion.
[1:42:47] "When he died at Calvary, he made a way.
[1:42:51] He gave up the spirit, the Holy Spirit,
[1:42:54] that sent it back to the earth for you
[1:42:59] and I to live by."
[1:43:02] Amen.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; I want you to that day at Calvary.
[1:43:08] He died
[1:43:10] and released the spirit to come back
[1:43:13] upon you and upon me to live by. So
[1:43:18] whatever that spirit that you and I are
[1:43:20] living by, it'll be the same spirit that
[1:43:22] was in him when he went to Calvary. This
[1:43:25] is brother Bram's whole message when he
[1:43:27] went to Calvary.
[1:43:30] And it says that's what Calvary means to
[1:43:32] us to follow him.
[1:43:36] He was just one man.
[1:43:39] He gave his life and he made an example
[1:43:43] for you.
[1:43:46] Now he says, "What must
[1:43:49] what must we do?"
[1:43:51] He says, "Now the first thing I want to
[1:43:53] say is here's the first thing. Jesus
[1:43:56] never lived for himself.
[1:43:59] His life was spent for others.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; And Calvary was the personification
[1:44:06] of that life. He never went to Calvary
[1:44:09] for himself.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; It was a personification of a life that
[1:44:13] was given for others.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; He lived his whole life for others. Now
[1:44:17] he's on the cross dying accused
[1:44:22] ill ill uh spoken and witnessed against
[1:44:26] and he's standing there hanging there
[1:44:29] dying there to give us an example so
[1:44:32] that when the spirit leaves him and
[1:44:34] comes into us we'll live the same kind
[1:44:36] of life that was the personification we
[1:44:39] look at Calvary that's exactly what
[1:44:41] brother Brandham is saying
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; that's right just for a few moments,
[1:44:47] please. He said that's Jesus never lived
[1:44:51] for himself. His life was spent for
[1:44:53] others. And that's that's perfectly
[1:44:57] eternal life.
[1:44:59] He says, "But when you live your life
[1:45:01] for to yourself,
[1:45:04] you haven't eternal life. Eternal life
[1:45:06] is living for others." So, we hear that
[1:45:09] so many many times. I just decided I
[1:45:11] needed to really break down break that
[1:45:13] down and focus on it.
[1:45:16] He said it proved it when he came in the
[1:45:20] lamb of God. He lived and had eternal
[1:45:23] life because he did not live for
[1:45:25] himself. He lived for others. And you
[1:45:28] receive eternal life by receiving that
[1:45:31] day. And you don't live for yourself no
[1:45:34] more. You live for others.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; And someone said said to brother
[1:45:38] Brandham,
[1:45:40] "How can you stand?" Now notice the the
[1:45:43] right angle turn he's taking in his
[1:45:45] message.
[1:45:47] How can you stand and let anyone call
[1:45:49] you such bad names? Now it's coming down
[1:45:52] to his address. He said you don't live
[1:45:56] for yourself.
[1:45:57] You live for others that you might
[1:46:00] redeem that man.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; But that you might nourish that man.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; That you might restore that person who's
[1:46:08] calling you bad names. saying evil
[1:46:11] reports about you or whatever more. But
[1:46:15] if we
[1:46:17] if we had that person saying slanderous
[1:46:20] things and innuendos and kind of snide
[1:46:25] remarks,
[1:46:27] you know, against you and you rear up
[1:46:30] and say, "Well, you know, you're not so
[1:46:32] perfect
[1:46:34] or I know a few things about you."
[1:46:38] Brother Brandham said from the things
[1:46:41] that that God would reveal to him or the
[1:46:44] things that were confessed in that
[1:46:46] little room, he said there'll be court
[1:46:50] cases.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; It'll tear homes all to pieces.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; So what was he doing? Hiding those
[1:46:57] things? No, he's protecting them because
[1:46:59] the direction is a a direction of of
[1:47:02] healing.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; I had a call yesterday. said, "Should I
[1:47:08] call the authorities
[1:47:10] about this situation?
[1:47:12] Should I call the authorities and
[1:47:14] involve them?" Had to say, "I know we've
[1:47:16] got police brothers here and in in front
[1:47:19] of them and in front of the world." I
[1:47:21] said, "That's the last thing you want to
[1:47:22] do. You're going to destroy your child."
[1:47:27] He said, "That's what I thought." This
[1:47:29] is someone who used to sit here
[1:47:33] years ago.
[1:47:35] But as soon as this call, even though it
[1:47:37] was in the midst of my studies, as soon
[1:47:38] as the call came, I took the call
[1:47:42] because I wanted to see what it was. And
[1:47:45] he's seeking counsel, and I believe it
[1:47:48] was godly counsel. I said, I've had many
[1:47:51] experiences along these lines. He says,
[1:47:53] that's exactly how I felt in my heart. I
[1:47:56] need to do that about his child.
[1:48:00] You see friends,
[1:48:03] it is this it is this healing ministry.
[1:48:07] And I have felt I'm coming down to the
[1:48:10] end of the road. This is not brother Ed
[1:48:13] Biscll's ministry. It's your ministry.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; It's a ministry. I didn't hear enough
[1:48:18] amen out of that.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; It's a ministry of the congregation. And
[1:48:21] it's the ministry. Maybe you don't have
[1:48:23] to study to preach next Sunday or
[1:48:25] whatever more or next Wednesday, but
[1:48:27] it's your ministry. And anybody that
[1:48:29] gets the idea that the preacher does it
[1:48:32] is completely wrong. It's your ministry.
[1:48:35] And the fact that we have telephones and
[1:48:37] iPods and texts and all of these kind of
[1:48:40] things that unless that unless that's
[1:48:42] being used in a positive way, I wouldn't
[1:48:45] use it.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't let it spread gospel. I
[1:48:51] wouldn't let my fingers handle and
[1:48:52] spread gossip.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't tear somebody down. I'd build
[1:48:56] them up.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Looking down here at brother Andrew and
[1:49:04] his wife said to Dorothy, I had in
[1:49:07] Ukraine the brother said to me, "What is
[1:49:09] that Polish brother in your church?" I
[1:49:10] said, "Brother Andrew, yes. Yes. He and
[1:49:14] his family." And he said, "I came there
[1:49:16] and I didn't have a jacket." and they
[1:49:18] gave me a jacket and they you know he he
[1:49:21] said I he said give them many many
[1:49:23] thanks what is it somebody on the other
[1:49:26] side of the world remembers the kindness
[1:49:29] that was poured out upon them there's
[1:49:31] nothing that hidden from God
[1:49:34] [Applause]
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; you live for others
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; to redeem that man
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; he said you're taking you're taking low
[1:49:47] congregation,
[1:49:49] prophet, messenger saying to you, you're
[1:49:51] taking Christ's place.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; What an honor.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; I say, "Father, I accept that."
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Could you raise your hand with me?
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Father, I accept that. Would you do
[1:50:05] that? I accept that you're taking
[1:50:08] Christ's place.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; You are sons, so you don't live for
[1:50:13] yourself.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; I take Christ's place.
[1:50:27] Two more last little thoughts. I hope to
[1:50:30] be done about five minutes.
[1:50:35] Brother Brandham makes a point, a strong
[1:50:37] point. And he says, "This isn't this
[1:50:40] isn't consciously done.
[1:50:43] It's unconsciously done. Don't go out of
[1:50:46] here saying, "Well, now I have to try to
[1:50:48] do it. I have to kind of find to do it.
[1:50:49] I I've got to find ways that I, you
[1:50:52] know, I I got to find a way so I can,
[1:50:54] you know, be giving and I want to always
[1:50:56] be giving and I want to encourage people
[1:50:58] and so on so forth." No, you let the
[1:51:00] Holy Spirit take this word this morning
[1:51:03] and start to just live in you. You'll
[1:51:05] just do it unconsciously.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; And you don't do it for reward. There's
[1:51:09] no such a reward for it. You just do it
[1:51:11] unconsciously.
[1:51:13] And lastly,
[1:51:16] if compassion living for others,
[1:51:19] brother Brandon was he was talking to
[1:51:22] his old friend Samadair and he says,
[1:51:25] "Dr. Samadair and I, we grew up as boys
[1:51:27] together.
[1:51:30] He walked into Samadair's office one day
[1:51:32] and and this is actually in Bruce
[1:51:35] Serpent.
[1:51:37] I have about three, four more pages, but
[1:51:39] I haven't got time." But of you that
[1:51:42] know the message and you know what Bruce
[1:51:44] Serpent was all about,
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; And this and this message happened to be
[1:51:49] just a few months. It was between Are
[1:51:52] you listening close?
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm telling you something I never
[1:51:55] told you before
[1:51:58] and hope I never have to tell you again.
[1:52:02] It was living. It was it was between the
[1:52:06] first time I went took brother Brandham
[1:52:08] on a rest and a hunt and the second time
[1:52:11] and in between he preached
[1:52:16] Bruce Serpent
[1:52:18] because people want to say he's he's
[1:52:20] Lord because it gets so close. You
[1:52:22] understand? Understand? Please
[1:52:24] understand.
[1:52:29] When John came on the scene, the spirit
[1:52:31] of Elijah, you have to understand this,
[1:52:33] the spirit of Elijah is so close to that
[1:52:36] of Christ
[1:52:38] that people have always got them
[1:52:40] confused.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Listen now.
[1:52:45] When John came on the scene, the spirit
[1:52:47] of Elijah to proclaim the first coming,
[1:52:50] they said to him, "Are you the Christ?"
[1:52:54] He said, "No."
[1:52:57] Why do they say that? Because that's
[1:52:58] what they felt.
[1:53:00] They felt something sacred.
[1:53:03] They felt something holy. They felt
[1:53:04] something very godly. Are you Christ?
[1:53:08] No, I'm not.
[1:53:11] Are you Elijah? Said, "No, I'm not."
[1:53:14] Because he knew that there was a further
[1:53:16] coming of Elijah. That's right.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; That he was not fulfilling
[1:53:20] comprehensively.
[1:53:22] And in fact is Faucet and Brown's
[1:53:25] commentary on the Bible which is a
[1:53:27] Baptist commentary if you go to Malachi
[1:53:30] that's exactly what they say.
[1:53:33] That is why Eli that's why John said no.
[1:53:36] Then when Jesus came
[1:53:40] the king the authority said it John has
[1:53:44] come back.
[1:53:46] Now we have the actual Messiah, God, the
[1:53:48] fullness of the Godhead bodily in a man,
[1:53:51] Jesus Christ, and they're confusing it
[1:53:54] with John the Baptist. When John was
[1:53:56] here, they thought he was Christ
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; or they thought he was Elijah. Then when
[1:54:00] Christ came, they thought he's John.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham came, they thought
[1:54:06] he was Christ.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; No big deal.
[1:54:12] And he took Bruce Serpent.
[1:54:15] You've never heard this before.
[1:54:18] I'm telling you some things I've never
[1:54:20] told you before because I don't know how
[1:54:21] much longer I'll be around.
[1:54:26] I was in a I was in the motel room with
[1:54:28] brother Brandham
[1:54:34] and uh
[1:54:37] the meetings were over and we're just
[1:54:39] going to go downtown to a store.
[1:54:43] just he and I standing there and a knock
[1:54:45] came on the door
[1:54:48] and we opened the door and there was a
[1:54:51] woman standing there very
[1:54:54] very godly uh believer
[1:54:58] and so we just opened the door and she
[1:55:01] just stepped in
[1:55:03] and she was standing
[1:55:06] her hands and just kind of looking
[1:55:09] very humble and I felt uncomfortable. I
[1:55:12] did not feel a good I didn't feel
[1:55:15] anything good about it. So I I said to
[1:55:17] brother Brandham, should I just step
[1:55:18] outside? So I said, he said, I think
[1:55:21] that'll be fine. So, I just stepped at a
[1:55:24] little we wooden porch and I stepped on
[1:55:25] that wooden porch and just stood there
[1:55:29] and waited for maybe 10 minutes
[1:55:33] and the door opened and she came out and
[1:55:35] I went in
[1:55:38] and uh so we just get, you know, Brother
[1:55:40] Brand was getting ready to go in the car
[1:55:42] and so we got in the car and started
[1:55:44] driving and now he's talking very very
[1:55:47] fast and nervous
[1:55:50] and uh he said, "Brother Eddie, He said,
[1:55:53] "Uh,
[1:55:54] do you know what that woman tried to
[1:55:56] do?" And I said, "No."
[1:55:58] Said, "She tried to worship me."
[1:56:01] Now,
[1:56:03] don't feel something drastic about that.
[1:56:06] They tried to worship me in India. They
[1:56:08] tried to worship Brother Lonnie Jenkins.
[1:56:10] It was just a part of their custom. But
[1:56:12] this was different. And this woman tried
[1:56:14] to worship him. And he said, "Woman,"
[1:56:18] and she called him Lord.
[1:56:21] And he said,"Woman,
[1:56:23] my father was a Catholic, an alcoholic,
[1:56:27] and my mother was a Catholic. Does that
[1:56:30] sound like the parents of your Lord?"
[1:56:33] And she said,
[1:56:35] "Oh, you just have to say it that way."
[1:56:38] And she called him Lord.
[1:56:41] And then he said, these are his words to
[1:56:43] me, "Woman."
[1:56:45] He said, "The first time he said,
[1:56:47] sister." Then this time he says,"Woman,
[1:56:50] you don't know what spirit you're of."
[1:56:52] And that was the end of the
[1:56:53] conversation. And she left.
[1:56:57] In the next few days, he's speaking
[1:57:01] and nervous and he says to me, "Brother
[1:57:05] Ed," he said, "Please, please forgive
[1:57:06] me." He said, "I just can't. I'm just so
[1:57:08] tore tore up over what that woman did."
[1:57:12] Why am I telling you this? Not to give
[1:57:14] you a story. I'm telling you this the
[1:57:17] next time you read Bruce Serpent and I
[1:57:19] had the notes here out of there.
[1:57:23] He talks about he talks this is what he
[1:57:27] says says I went to see my good friend
[1:57:30] Dr. Samadair
[1:57:33] and uh says, "Hi, hi Doc. How are you?"
[1:57:36] He says, "Not bad. How are you?" He
[1:57:38] said, "I'm not bad."
[1:57:41] And uh they start speaking about their
[1:57:44] life cuz they've been boy friends since
[1:57:46] boyhood.
[1:57:49] and he asked him
[1:57:54] he said uh
[1:58:00] he said to his doctor friend he said
[1:58:03] well I don't know just how long we're
[1:58:05] going to be around
[1:58:07] we're both in our 50s
[1:58:10] and he said that's true Bill
[1:58:13] and I said but all these years about 31
[1:58:15] years of ministry now I've kept my heart
[1:58:19] prepared for that hour when he comes. So
[1:58:22] it doesn't matter when he comes. And he
[1:58:25] said that is true. I said the greatest
[1:58:28] thrill I give you all of this background
[1:58:31] for these statements. The greatest
[1:58:33] thrill
[1:58:35] that I have
[1:58:40] is living for others.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[1:58:44] the greatest thrill that I have is
[1:58:47] living for others.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's what makes life
[1:58:52] real." The doctor said, "That's what
[1:58:54] makes life's real is when you not what
[1:58:59] you can do or accomplish for yourself,
[1:59:02] but what you can do for others."
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; That's what when you're really living.
[1:59:07] Amen.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Docadair said
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; and brother Bram says and there happens
[1:59:13] to be
[1:59:16] if there happens to be someone among us
[1:59:18] who has never did that
[1:59:21] and I felt
[1:59:23] I have to say that to this congregation
[1:59:25] this morning. If there happens to be
[1:59:27] someone here when brother Brandham lived
[1:59:30] when he spoke these words life was a lot
[1:59:33] simpler than it is right now. It was a
[1:59:35] complex age, but he said, "We live and
[1:59:38] you live in a very complex age."
[1:59:43] And if the greatest thing that a prophet
[1:59:45] of God could do would be to live for
[1:59:46] others, I can guarantee you the spirit
[1:59:49] of this age is exactly the opposite.
[1:59:53] Amen.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; It is to live for yourself and do it for
[1:59:56] yourself and get your education and get
[1:59:59] your scholarship and get this and get
[2:00:02] your job and get your raise and get your
[2:00:04] vacation time and get your whatever
[2:00:07] whatever it might be. That's the whole
[2:00:09] spirit of the age.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Right,
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; friends?
[2:00:13] If you would never hear my voice again,
[2:00:15] you go at these doors, I I would pray
[2:00:18] that you'll be resolved.
[2:00:21] That you're going to change that you are
[2:00:24] not going to be dictated to by the
[2:00:26] spirit of this age.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; And this congregation would be a giving
[2:00:30] congregation. This congregation would be
[2:00:32] a congregation that is prepared to give
[2:00:35] of themselves
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; with the spirit of Christ in them. And
[2:00:40] he goes on, he said, "If there's if
[2:00:42] there's no one that's never did that,"
[2:00:43] he said, "Try it. Try to live for
[2:00:46] somebody else, give that a try and just
[2:00:50] see how much more life holds for you
[2:00:53] when you will do when you will not live
[2:00:56] for what you can get yourself out of
[2:00:59] life, but what you can give someone else
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; in life."
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[2:01:12] That's his words.
[2:01:15] That's the spirit of Christ.
[2:01:18] And this congregation,
[2:01:21] I thank you
[2:01:24] for the spirit of giving and
[2:01:27] hospitality,
[2:01:30] your prayers.
[2:01:33] But I have to announce to you, God
[2:01:36] wants us to make a drastic step and a
[2:01:40] shift. And you'll start getting out of
[2:01:42] life so much more than you had ever
[2:01:45] expected.
[2:01:50] And I'm closing just now, but there's
[2:01:53] people in this congregation,
[2:01:56] there's people in this congregation,
[2:01:59] they were not well off.
[2:02:03] They had a number of children in their
[2:02:06] family.
[2:02:08] But after Sunday morning service,
[2:02:10] there's a number of people and some of
[2:02:12] them are in this service right now,
[2:02:16] different races
[2:02:18] that gathered every Sunday to that home.
[2:02:24] And that sister who had a sizable
[2:02:26] family,
[2:02:28] always had food on, and they had their
[2:02:31] fellowship.
[2:02:33] till the evening service. And that was
[2:02:36] almost Sunday after Sunday after Sunday,
[2:02:39] not for weeks or months, but for years.
[2:02:43] And God blessed that family.
[2:02:47] And I know on down the road, people may
[2:02:50] be look and say, "Oh, yeah. Well, you
[2:02:52] know, God so blessed them." You got it
[2:02:56] backwards.
[2:02:57] They just did something unconsciously.
[2:03:00] That was the thing to do. Here's some
[2:03:03] young brothers
[2:03:06] had no place to go
[2:03:08] and they came to our place or that place
[2:03:14] and that family's children are here.
[2:03:19] They probably don't even know who I'm
[2:03:21] speaking about.
[2:03:26] One Christmas time,
[2:03:28] my wife and I said, "For Christmas,
[2:03:32] people are with their family. We decided
[2:03:35] we were going to have brothers who have
[2:03:38] no family."
[2:03:41] And so we invited them. There was a man
[2:03:44] who was a bachelor that lived in
[2:03:46] Maryland and Mike's basement
[2:03:50] on the island. and we invited him and he
[2:03:54] came and he came early and he was
[2:03:57] sitting on my sofa. My wife was getting
[2:04:00] dinner ready. He went like this
[2:04:06] and he picked out a picture out of his
[2:04:08] wallet and held it up and it was the it
[2:04:13] was the boy that was raised from the
[2:04:14] dead in Finland.
[2:04:17] And he said, "Have you ever seen this
[2:04:18] picture?"
[2:04:20] I said, 'Yes,
[2:04:22] that's the boy that was raised from the
[2:04:24] dead in Finland. He said, 'I just
[2:04:26] visited him.
[2:04:29] He's a policeman now on the highway
[2:04:32] patrol just out of Helsinki.
[2:04:35] I was rewarded.
[2:04:38] I wasn't looking for a reward. It was
[2:04:40] just the right thing to do to have
[2:04:42] brothers there that didn't have any home
[2:04:44] or family, but I was rewarded by it. You
[2:04:47] see friends,
[2:04:49] living for others
[2:04:52] is really the life. It's the highest
[2:04:55] calling that you can have. I think most
[2:04:58] rewarding I will say.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Shall we bow our heads?
[2:05:07] Lord Jesus,
[2:05:11] your presence,
[2:05:13] not only your presence, but your life is
[2:05:15] the life that we desire to be expressed
[2:05:18] in us.
[2:05:20] This has been a different service. You
[2:05:22] have been dealing with me differently,
[2:05:24] Lord. And I I I want to just make myself
[2:05:27] open, oh God. I feel as though I have
[2:05:32] missed
[2:05:34] so much, Lord. Even you become occupied
[2:05:38] and taken up with burdens and of life
[2:05:40] and people's concerns and the burdens of
[2:05:43] the church and whatever more.
[2:05:46] But yet Lord I I personally this morning
[2:05:50] I want to rededicate myself. We want to
[2:05:54] with this congregation and I pray oh God
[2:05:56] that each of them each one that you're
[2:05:59] speaking to each you'll have to do the
[2:06:01] speaking Lord. You'll have to touch
[2:06:03] their hearts, oh God, and just open
[2:06:05] their hearts up. And if they have a
[2:06:07] desire, and I believe that they do, we
[2:06:09] want to make ourselves available, Lord.
[2:06:12] We want to say, "Here I am. Bring me
[2:06:14] into this situation. Let the Holy Spirit
[2:06:16] begin to work through my life.
[2:06:20] Lord, begin to work.
[2:06:23] Use my hands. Use my feet. Use my mouth.
[2:06:27] Put a seal, oh God, upon my speaking
[2:06:30] that I will not say anything contrary,
[2:06:33] but I will build up the body of Jesus
[2:06:35] Christ. Cause me to be an active active
[2:06:39] member. Cause me, oh God, to live for
[2:06:43] others. I pray, Father, you'll turn my
[2:06:46] direction that we'll not live for
[2:06:48] ourselves to just improve or to better
[2:06:50] our own situation, but may we just make
[2:06:54] ourselves available to you. Oh God, we
[2:06:56] surrender and dedicate ourselves to you.
[2:06:59] And in the name of Jesus Christ, I pray
[2:07:02] Lord, you'll receive us. There's so many
[2:07:05] young men and women that are here.
[2:07:08] Father, let this service be a milestone
[2:07:11] in their lives. I pray that homes will
[2:07:14] be opened, lives will be opened, that
[2:07:18] there will be a a a closer fellowship
[2:07:21] amongst the people, oh God, not for
[2:07:24] lightness or frivolity, but for
[2:07:27] spiritual strengthening of one another.
[2:07:29] And let the Holy Spirit through this
[2:07:32] movement, through this body, have a
[2:07:35] movement of nourishment to the body of
[2:07:37] Christ. Not only locally, but may they
[2:07:40] realize, oh God, that we're reaching far
[2:07:42] beyond the boundaries of this building
[2:07:46] to others that are far away in different
[2:07:49] lands and different countries and
[2:07:50] different places. Let us be a tool,
[2:07:53] Father, in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:58] All that I have and all that I am.
[2:08:03] [Music]
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Let's stand, shall we?
[2:08:17] [Music]
[2:08:18] [Applause]
[2:08:25] Heat. Heat.
[2:08:32] [Applause]
[2:08:34] [Music]
[2:08:36] [Applause]
[2:08:37] [Music]
[2:08:42] Let's sing them jointly now as a prayer
[2:08:43] everyone with lifting up your voice.
[2:08:47] All that I am.
[2:08:52] All that I am.
[2:08:57] All I shall ever
[2:09:01] be.
[2:09:04] [Music]
[2:09:06] Can not repay
[2:09:13] my own.
[2:09:16] I
[2:09:18] surrender
[2:09:20] to thee.
[2:09:23] Let's sing it again. And I wonder,
[2:09:24] brother Jonathan, if you're here, if you
[2:09:26] could just come up, please. All that I
[2:09:31] am,
[2:09:33] all that I am,
[2:09:38] all
[2:09:40] I surrender.
[2:09:45] Grant it, Lord Jesus. hear the prayer
[2:09:48] and not repay
[2:09:53] the love
[2:09:55] I
[2:10:00] surrender
[2:10:02] to thee.
[2:10:06] I feel like singing it once more again,
[2:10:08] please. I'd like you to notice the last
[2:10:11] words. Cannot repay the love debt. A
[2:10:16] week ago, Wednesday,
[2:10:18] I just said, "I am debtor." Now I turn
[2:10:20] it just a wee bit. We are all debtors.
[2:10:24] We're debtors. To demonstrate,
[2:10:27] to show this compassion,
[2:10:30] I believe we're in debt. I've actually
[2:10:34] imposed a debt on you today to live for
[2:10:37] others.
[2:10:39] Do you accept that?
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; This is not an option.
[2:10:44] This is a requirement
[2:10:46] by the scripture. Our Lord live for
[2:10:50] others.
[2:10:52] We just adjust things to do it according
[2:10:56] to the Holy Spirit. I feel very very
[2:10:59] compelled this morning to let you know
[2:11:02] that this is the ministry of healing of
[2:11:04] this church. And whether it is by your
[2:11:08] prayers,
[2:11:10] your dedication in your particular area
[2:11:14] and make plans,
[2:11:17] make plans,
[2:11:19] definite plans.
[2:11:22] I want to serve the bride of Jesus
[2:11:24] Christ.
[2:11:27] And the prophet of God says, "If you
[2:11:28] haven't done it, try it.
[2:11:30] You'll find that life is so fulfilling."
[2:11:33] Amen.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; Of course it will be because you're
[2:11:35] allowing the spirit
[2:11:38] of Christ to come through you.
[2:11:44] I surrender all to thee, all that I
[2:11:47] have. And then and then we're going to
[2:11:49] have the baptismal right away. Soon as
[2:11:51] we've done singing one more course after
[2:11:53] this,
[2:11:56] if you must dismiss, you just dismiss
[2:11:58] quietly. I'll have a prayer. And those
[2:12:01] that can remain, it'll only be a few
[2:12:03] minutes. And we'll have our brother
[2:12:04] baptized. I think it's nice to support
[2:12:06] him having driven six hours. He has to
[2:12:08] go six hours back right after service.
[2:12:10] So we'll sing this once again as a
[2:12:12] prayer. I'm I'm joining with you. I'm
[2:12:15] joining with you.
[2:12:17] Oh,
[2:12:19] [Music]
[2:12:31] shall
[2:12:32] [Music]
[2:12:34] be
[2:12:35] [Music]
[2:12:43] the love that I
[2:12:47] [Music]
[2:12:51] surrender
[2:12:53] to the
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; I have a father. If I have a father,
[2:12:58] then
[2:13:00] [Music]
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; I have a
[2:13:08] [Music]
[2:13:10] before
[2:13:12] my heart.
[2:13:16] And before even time began,
[2:13:22] my life was in his hand.
[2:13:30] He knows my name.
[2:13:36] He knows my everyone.
[2:13:43] He sees his
[2:13:48] hear me when I go.
[2:13:54] [Music]
[2:13:56] I have a father.
[2:14:02] He calls me his home.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; How wonderful.
[2:14:09] And you never
[2:14:13] [Music]
[2:14:23] [Music]
[2:14:38] Oh,
[2:14:39] hear me when I call.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:51] Amen.
[2:14:54] I've been We're just waiting for the
[2:14:56] brothers.
[2:15:02] I've had a simple prayer
[2:15:06] while I was just away and talking to the
[2:15:10] Lord in the woods.
[2:15:12] And yesterday,
[2:15:14] a number of times, I've had a simple
[2:15:15] prayer. Maybe you want to join me in
[2:15:18] that prayer.
[2:15:21] What would you have me to do?
[2:15:24] As I walk I work my way through this
[2:15:25] message. So, what would you have me to
[2:15:28] do?
[2:15:30] What would what would please you? What
[2:15:32] do you want me to do? And I believe he
[2:15:35] sees our heart and we're prepared and
[2:15:37] ready. Whatever you say, Lord, I'll do.
[2:15:42] What would you have me to do?
[2:15:46] And these words were in my mind.
[2:15:51] I have a father.
[2:15:55] Surely he'll tell me what he wants me to
[2:15:57] do. I have a father.
[2:16:00] Let's just sing that again. I have a
[2:16:02] father.
[2:16:04] I have a father.
[2:16:08] [Music]
[2:16:12] He calls his
[2:16:19] and he'll never
[2:16:21] leave me.
[2:16:24] No matter where I go,
[2:16:29] [Music]
[2:16:37] [Music]
[2:16:46] He sees me
[2:16:49] fall.
[2:16:51] [Music]
[2:16:56] You may be seated.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you for your time
[2:17:04] today to uh be with our brother Paul
[2:17:07] Richmond that God's been dealing with
[2:17:09] now for the last seven, eight years. His
[2:17:11] wife Sonia is here and his family, they
[2:17:13] drove here today and need to go right
[2:17:16] back home. Paul desires to be filled
[2:17:18] with the Holy Spirit. And he desires the
[2:17:21] life of God that he's heard about, that
[2:17:24] he's studied, he's looked for, but now
[2:17:27] he knows he's come to this place that
[2:17:31] Jesus Christ would step inside of his
[2:17:33] life, that the old man would die and
[2:17:36] that the new man would come forth. And
[2:17:39] that's what we're with you for today
[2:17:40] here, brother Paul. I'm just gonna let
[2:17:42] you speak with time.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; About eight years ago, my wife was
[2:17:46] standing here.
[2:17:49] About 8 years ago,
[2:17:53] Hallelujah.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; And all of our lives are different when
[2:18:04] we respond to in relationship. Sometimes
[2:18:08] they're quick, sometimes there's long,
[2:18:11] but what we're happy about is there's
[2:18:12] finally a day comes when there's a
[2:18:14] marriage takes place. So that's what we
[2:18:16] want to rejoice with brother Paul about
[2:18:18] today. And brother Paul, I felt to say
[2:18:20] this to you that all the years and all
[2:18:23] the things that's gone on, God's had
[2:18:26] grace upon your life and mercy to
[2:18:30] continue around your life to give you
[2:18:32] this opportunity.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; And I just pray that the Holy Spirit
[2:18:35] will come and fill this vessel. We've
[2:18:37] gone through the scriptures and gone
[2:18:39] through the things together and brother
[2:18:40] Paul knows exactly what the Lord has for
[2:18:43] him. Let's agree together that the Lord
[2:18:45] will just come and fill this life.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, what a great opportunity it is to
[2:18:53] be standing with you at this end time
[2:18:55] and know that your grace and mercy is
[2:18:58] able to win a heart, is able to terry
[2:19:01] with a soul. You deal with our natures
[2:19:05] and the way that we are in so many
[2:19:06] different ways, but the end result of it
[2:19:10] is we come to you when you call to us.
[2:19:14] And that is a wonderful thing, God. I
[2:19:17] pray that you bless our brother Paul
[2:19:19] today. I pray that you would fill him
[2:19:21] with your Holy Spirit as we spoke about
[2:19:24] your word and he's repented and he knows
[2:19:27] that this is a step of faith. I pray as
[2:19:30] you reveal yourself to him that you
[2:19:32] would draw closer and that you would
[2:19:35] fill his life today and in the coming
[2:19:37] days and the time that you would have
[2:19:39] for us before you take us home that our
[2:19:42] brother Paul and his wife, his children
[2:19:45] that they would recognize that there's
[2:19:47] been another life, there's been another
[2:19:49] person step into their home and it's
[2:19:52] been none other than you, Lord. Pray
[2:19:54] that you bless him in his desire, his
[2:19:56] willingness, his sincerity. I pray as he
[2:19:59] travels home today, God, that his heart
[2:20:01] would burn within him. That the word
[2:20:04] would come alive. That this
[2:20:06] relationship, this marriage that we
[2:20:08] spoke about, that it would become more
[2:20:10] dearer, more wonderful, more lovely.
[2:20:14] Bless him now, Lord. May the fire of God
[2:20:17] take this vessel as he goes down into
[2:20:19] the water and the old man is put to
[2:20:22] rest. May he rise in a resurrection and
[2:20:25] a new life and a new hold, a new hope, a
[2:20:29] new experience. I pray the token would
[2:20:32] be upon him even today that the blood
[2:20:35] would be applied to brother Paul's life.
[2:20:38] We thank you Lord and we receive your
[2:20:40] Holy Spirit to another part of your body
[2:20:43] being joined today into this great
[2:20:45] family. We thank you Lord in Jesus name.
[2:20:51] Brother Paul, just according to your
[2:20:53] desire and your hungry hungry heart and
[2:20:57] thirsty heart to receive Jesus Christ
[2:21:00] into your life, I baptize you in the
[2:21:04] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:21:11] God bless you. God bless you. Amen.
[2:21:27] Isn't it wonderful?
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just going to stand. We're
[2:21:31] going to have prayer. We're going to ask
[2:21:33] our brother Deepak if you'll come,
[2:21:36] please.
[2:21:38] Uh
[2:21:39] our brother Deepac needs work
[2:21:42] desperately
[2:21:43] and you've been almost overqualified for
[2:21:47] the places that he's applied. So we as a
[2:21:50] congregation are going to pray just now.
[2:21:53] What are you going to do? We're just
[2:21:54] going to give a little bit of time.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're going to pray
[2:21:58] together. I wonder brother DJ would you
[2:22:00] join also with our brother DPAC? We're
[2:22:04] going to pray and let let's sing once
[2:22:07] again. All things are possible. Oh, we
