I'm going to ask brother Tom open the service this morning in a word of prayer. got a a request this morning uh email that I received from uh brother Ken Fury up in Edmonton who had a brother uh request that uh we pray this morning for um a nephew of a brother by the name of uh Lorie Mloud and uh he's been diagnosed with cancer. He's going in for surgery this week and is praying that God would heal him and grant healing for his soul as well. And uh our sister Rebecca Walsher is requesting prayer this morning for her uncle who was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer in November. Uh he just received Christ in the last two weeks and is uh emailed the family just uh asking forgiveness for some of the things he's done. Um and uh his daughter emailed today and asked if we would pray that he would be well enough to come home for a few days over the Christmas season. So I want to remember this brother in prayer this morning. Brother Vio [Music] uh and is requesting prayer this morning. Um he's traveling uh with sister Mara uh to see sister Mara's mother. is very close to death and uh he's brother Vai is requesting strength for sister Mara and that at this time of deep grief would be used for God to do an eternal work. So you want to remember uh the Moscu family this morning. Um, Sister Yola is requesting prayer for a sister Helina from Poland who lost her father in February and now her mother has been diagnosed with diabetes. And next Wednesday, she is scheduled to have part of her foot amputated. She's asking for prayer for healing and strength for the whole family as they're going through these hard times. They uh watch the services over the internet. and so may be watching us this morning. We want to unite our hearts with him this morning. Um want to remember brother Ernie Veloe is going back to the Philippines and also u there's a request that we remember brother Isaac Laontaine's father-in-law Steve Johnson who uh has been diagnosed with uh tumors in his liver and they're going to be doing a biopsy tomorrow and want to pray that God's will would be done. Amen. So uh we want to remember these requests. If you're listening on the internet and you've got a need, you just lift it before the Lord. Would you go to prayer and uh if you're here this morning, you've got a need, just lift your hand before the Lord. He knows your need. Amen, brother Tom. Lord, a very appropriate song this morning. Be it unto me according to thy word. And so Lord, on the basis of your word, you said, "Ask anything in my name, believing, and you shall have what you ask." And so Lord, in the precious name of Jesus Christ, we lay our hands upon these requests as brother Rod has spoken them. Hands have been raised around this little sanctuary. Lord, needs are here, Lord Jesus. We've been remembering in our hearts, Sister Vanessa. Lord, we're believing for a supernatural move of God. Lord, you're still a beautiful star. You're the one that held those seven stars in your hand. Lord, you led wise men, Lord, to the word. You're leading men and women again to the promises of your word. And Lord, I'm praying, God, that you will meet every need according to your word. We're going to ask abundantly, Lord. cancers may they leave in the name of Jesus Christ. Diabetes Lord may it go in the name of Jesus Christ. Whatever the affliction, whatever the disease, we resist it in the name above all names. Hart the herald angels sing. Glory to the King of Kings. Lord, we want to join our voices with those holy angels this morning because we believe you're a supernatural being and you work in mysterious ways your wonders to perform deal with lives. Lord, may they come to you not to a babe in a manger, but to a savior, a healer, a redeemer. God, meet these needs we pray. Move in our midst, Lord. Anoint your servant this morning. Anoint our eyes and our ears to hear what the spirit would say to the church. Move us, Lord, into a love relationship with you and you alone. We pray that you will speak to us deeply on this Christmas season. Lord, that we could come into that chamber, be sweet Holy Spirit, and speak to me gently. Would you anoint brother Ed and anoint us? We pray. and meet these precious needs, Lord. Precious needs, Lord. I pray, God, you'll supernaturally. Touch each and everyone. And Father, we will be sure to give you then the glory, the honor, and praise. Do your holy name. We commit this service, all the songs, all the worship. May it just be pleasing in your eyes. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. [Music] We want to welcome all those who are visiting with us this morning and uh happy to have you here with us. It's good to see brother sister Andy's. God bless you and happy to hear with us. Brother Kim and Sister Hedi are down here for keeps now. They got a house anyways. They moved into so uh we're happy to have uh the Dingwall family here with us and want to officially welcome them to the assembly and I'm sure everybody knows Brother Kim, Sister Hedi. We're happy to have them here. Um Jake and Aaron and couple of my grandkids are down here. If you see some kids walking around look like little Norwegians and dressed like them, uh, Brother Brett will be happy this morning. We got them dressed in the Norwegian national costume. So, so uh um we're happy to have each and every one of you here this morning and um and trust that God would bless you this Christmas season and be a real testimony to your to your family. Good to see Jonathan, brother Jonathan Coral. Good to see you here. And if we missed anyone, uh, just forgive us. We're going to take a few minutes, uh, Jeremy, if you can get the clip ready. And, uh, and the brothers in the video room, if you could make sure that the musicians could see what's happening here. Sometimes they feel left out and, uh, they contribute a wonderful part to the service and we don't want to leave them left out of anything. U,, we're going to play an introduction. Uh you've heard about the witnessing website that Jeremy's been working on and and a few others here at the church and uh unfortunately it's too few although a lot of people have volunteered uh not very many people have actually uh come through but we we are getting things done and we wanted to share with you. This is not in finished form, but it will be very soon. And I wanted to give you a little taste of what it will look like and hopefully encourage some of you uh to uh that maybe uh haven't helped to help out a little bit. Um the purpose of the site is to introduce people to the message. Those that haven't heard of the message, we want to introduce the message to them. Brother Brandham said, "We are God's people all marching together with one great purpose." &gt;&gt; Amen. to win souls for Christ. &gt;&gt; And he said, "May it ever be that way." &gt;&gt; And I want to thank brother James Rosac who is instrumental up in Edmonton in putting this together. Brother Tom, Brother Michael Ray, Phil Ashdown, Jeremy uh um and uh for this little clip here. We've had a few others who are helping in kind of the detail. We'll talk about that a little bit more. So maybe Jeremy, you could roll the first clip. And the music on this was played by our brother uh Philip Ashdown. [Music] And then it introduces people to the uh the photograph. Now, if you uh turn um Jeremy and go to the second sign, we want to introduce &gt;&gt; you. You've had a I see a great crash of some sort. It's an accident. Yes. &gt;&gt; And you it was a car wreck &gt;&gt; and you were thrown in the air like that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And it strang somewhere in your neck and caused a a cancer to come into your neck or &gt;&gt; and you're some sort of a teach in the scripture and you believe that Jesus Christ makes you well. I do. Father God, in the name of thy son Jesus Christ on the authority of God's word by a dying woman, I ask this evil thing to leave her. Satan, you are exposed. So come out of the woman as the church of the living God calls for you to leave in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, uh, we're going to show one other clip. There's going to be and this the whole purpose of this initial introduction for the website is to show people what the ministry of brother Brandon was about, but we also want to bring it up to date to what's happening today. And uh, we've got a clip that includes a few people um that, you know, who have experienced the touch of God in their lives. Jeremy Hi, my name is Benjamin Derti. I broke my neck while I was bouncing on the trampoline and the next day the Lord healed me. My name is David Law and I had flesh eating disease in my shoulder and a few of my organs. And uh the Lord Jesus healed me and I have absolutely 100% use of all my body. I didn't lose anything. &gt;&gt; My name is Beth Dingwall. When I was eight, I was diagnosed with leukemia alll Philadelphia positive. The Lord has healed me miraculously. Hi, my name is Shayla and when I was 3 months old um I started having seizures and about after a month in the hospital um I got sent home and the doctors told my parents that I would be mentally for the rest of my life and my parents and believers around the world were praying for me and the Lord totally touched me and I'm 100%. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the whole purpose of that again is to attract people to see that there has been a sign in this day and then we've got a whole detailed website behind it and that's where we really need some help. Um how many were here last Sunday morning? Men. Brother Biscll talked about Mark 14:8, the woman with the alabaster block. She hath done what she could. Brother Brandon said, "What our main purpose is here for is to capture the unbeliever to a faith in God. That's what we want to do is to see the sinner converted to a living faith in our Lord Jesus Christ." And that's our main thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh you know what I'm going to ask some of you and I and this is particularly the young people if you're grade nine and up you can write something that people can understand. And uh you don't have to say I don't know where to start. We've already got a good start but we do need some help. And uh there are two kinds of people. There's people get things done and there's people that never get anything done. And personally I want to be somebody who can get thing done for the kingdom of God. Amen. So, if you're interested, go to the Bible way website. You'll see a link on the bottom asking for help and uh we can really use it as much as we can get. As much as your time as you can give us, we can use. Amen. &gt;&gt; You excited about what God is doing? &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. We're going to have uh I think a uh there's a baby dedication. Um and then the uh the school choir is going to sing for us. But before they do, I want to sing maybe a little chorus. Go tell it on the mountain. Amen. We want to stand up and tell what God has done for us. Amen. So, let's stand together. Now, this is not the traditional version of this song. Uh I've been listening to Mahelia Jackson sing it all week. And uh so, if you don't know it or you know another version, just listen to me first. You can sing the chorus. And if you know the the verses uh the way she sings it, well then you can join along with me. Go tell it on the mountain, over the hills and far away. Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born. The shepherds kept their watching over their sheep at night. Behold a star from heaven that shone a holy light. Halleluah. Go tell it on the mountain, over the hills, everywhere. Go tell him on the mountain that Jesus Christ is born. The shepherds fear and tremble when low above the earth rang out the angel chorus that he savior. Everybody go tell it on mountain over the hill. Everywhere tell it on mountain that Jesus Christ is born. They found a lonely manger where the humble Christ was born. And God sent out salvation on that blessed Christmas. Hallelujah. Go tell it on the mountain over the hills and everywhere. Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ did for and he brought with him forgiveness. He lived to show his way. He came to redeem every sinner and to wash our sins away. Hallelujah. Go tell it all those. Oh, thank you everywhere. Go tell it on the mountain that Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Go tell it on the mountain. Everywhere. Go tell it on the mountain. Jesus Christ is born. Go tell it on the mountain over the hill and go tell it on the mountain. Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. That's our commission. You may have your seats. Amen. It's a full day, folks. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Donald has been coming to the church for how many years, brother John? &gt;&gt; Since 1996. &gt;&gt; Since 1996. And through uh our sister Ada has met Alda. And God brought them together. And now this morning we have Gabriel in another form. And Gabriel means a warrior of God. So this morning we want to dedicate Gabriel to be not just a warrior but a warrior of the word. &gt;&gt; A warrior from his youth. One that can stand with thus sayeth the Lord. And you know the wonderful thing about the Bible is is it's such a a guiding light for us. Proverbs 22:6 says, "Train up a child and the way it shall go and when he is old, he will not depart from it." You know this wonderful thing about Jesus Christ is that he being the word lived the word that was laying in the word and here now he was born raised up and when he came to his commission the Bible says in Luke 4 and Jesus came to Nazareth where he was born and was brought up and as was his custom he went into the synagogue train a child up the Word of God when it grows old, it shall not depart. May the Holy Spirit so train him up. And may the presence of God so protect this child that he would become a warrior of God. Amen. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, this morning cradled in my arms is a gift that you have given to a couple Lord that have given their lives to you. You have blessed their home. You united them together and Lord this child was born Gabriel warrior Lord &gt;&gt; of the Lord. We pray Lord that your hand will ever rest upon him. Amen. &gt;&gt; That you will keep him Lord Jesus under the blanket of your presence. May you put a wall of fire around him Lord. And father from his youth and growing up may hear of this Jesus Christ, Savior, Lord, King of Kings. And Father, may he know you at a young age. And may he Lord be a testimony of your grace. Father, we're asking that your blessings will rest upon this child as we dedicate him this morning to you. Mother and father has brought him to the house of God. That he be dedicated before God. And so we offer him this morning as a love gift to you, Father. And may your grace ever rest and guide and lead him through life's journey. We pray as we dedicate little Gabriel to you in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. May the Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Tom. Um, we have um the Bible Waych Christian Academy, the school kids are going to come and sing. Maybe they can come at this time. As they're coming, we've got a couple of announcement. Um, we got uh the first young peoples uh of the new year will be the second Friday of January, January the 12th here at the church. And the age group for young people's is those that were in senior camp in 2006. So if you were at senior camp uh this year, then you're welcome to come to young people's. Also, we've had a request from the deacons that um we be very careful and mindful of our neighbors. You know, we're commanded to love our neighbors as ourselves. And uh neighbors have lawns, they have driveways, and we don't want to park in their driveways or, you know, blocking part of their driveways. We want to stay off their lawns. And uh some u I think people maybe have accidentally not heated that. So, if we could in the future, please be careful, remember where you're parking, watch out, and uh we'd appreciate that very much. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah.

When little things like that happen, doesn't bother me. That's that I guess that's the missionary part. We just have so many things. Had lights go out, sit in the blackness, cold or whatever more. That doesn't make any difference. &gt;&gt; God's the same. &gt;&gt; We came here for a purpose &gt;&gt; and God's going to achieve his purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; Welcome to the Dingwall family also officially. God bless you. I'll have you turn in your Bibles, please, to John's Gospel, the first chapter. And I don't know exactly how the service is, the message part is going to come, but I'm just looking for divine guidance right at this time. &gt;&gt; And I believe that God will give that to us. It's not so much a subject. I want to speak. I'm going to carry on, Lord willing, from last week, the mystery of God in the flesh. And this will be part two. So, it'll tie into last week. We'll start reading at verse one. In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of man. And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a witness to bear witness of the light, that all men through him might believe. Notice, all men through him might believe. John was a witness to that light that all men through him might believe that he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which cometh which lightth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name, which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory, the glory as the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth. Amen. How wonderful. &gt;&gt; Let's just ask God's blessing. Father, we ask your blessing upon our gathering and upon the gathering of the invisible internet congregation as well. wherever they may be gathered, gathered together with us now at this moment. And we feel, oh Lord, the impulse of the Holy Spirit. This is a sacred time when your people gather. We've gathered here because we hunger and thirst after righteousness. We have gathered here because we anticipate a resurrection. We've gathered here because we expect, we're in full expectation of the change of the body and the rapture of the church and the catching away of the believing saints of God. We believe that there's a great host that's just a breath away. We believe that there's angels at this moment at their stations in this sanctuary and elsewhere, Lord, throughout the world where your people are gathering. We believe, Father, that we are a group of people individually and corporately that are held in your hand and that no man can take us out of that place. How we love the security, oh God, that we sense this morning. Bless the congregation that is here, Father. And I pray that you will give utterance, Lord. And may when my mouth opens, let it not be human breath as it were, but may the words be the breath of God to the people I pray. And Father, cause us to think, cause us to ponder deeply. Cause us to be stirred. And if there's any portion of any heart that's present that is not fully surrendered, may it be cut loose by the Holy Spirit. and may the world disappear and pale off into the invisible become just an unessential part of our lives. Lord, as we give ourselves to you and prepare our little sister that'll be baptized right after the preaching of the word, we ask all of these things and we surrender ourselves, yield ourselves holy to the Holy Spirit at this moment in the name of Jesus Christ and for the glory of God alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. I I'd like to pose some questions uh right at the beginning of the service to kind of get your thoughts moving in a direction. Generally when I'm speaking and taking a a subject as thorough as I'd like to take it this morning I like to start and build a big foundation and then come with what is really the core core thought. But uh today I want to just take a quantum leap into the message and say you know here's kind of the direction I've been pondering in my own mind and I want to get you thinking about these things as well. In the scripture which we read we concluded with the verse and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory. John did John's writing of his own experience. He did see Christ in the flesh. He saw him, shall I say, in his first coming and uh experience part of that cycle of his first coming. Uh individually as an individual, it would have had some depth and meaning to him. And corporately, corporately as a body of believers where there were disciples and others, uh it was having a certain effect on them. And I suppose as it is today, it was having a a different effect on different individuals. Some were very gripped by what was happening. Some were completely consumed by what was happening. They were so consumed that the everything they were engaged in whether it was fishing and family or whatever more became like obsolete to them and they became completely consumed with what was they were engaged in and what was transpiring and what was happening and they were hearing for the first time scriptures from the Old Testament brought forward and and being applied to that very moment and thought well I've never connected that before and that was that was continued. Jesus was bringing them and and so so they were caught in some kind of a cycle and I'm I'm sure they asked themselves a question I've asked myself and I'm asking my question again with you today. Where are we in the cycle of his second coming? the world, they're all caught up in their thing which is they are calling Christmas and we know that uh the world at large is missing it. We don't want to miss it. &gt;&gt; We don't want to miss what God is doing. So my question is how far along has the message moved us into the cycle of his coming? How many scriptures have been fulfilled and are being fulfilled that pertain to the second coming? How many scriptures have been fulfilled while we are sitting here? While we've been attending church, &gt;&gt; while we've been declaring that we are believers, how many scriptures have been fulfilled? And uh how many are going to miss it? Brother Brandham says something here and then I'm going to take it to another stage in Christ the mystery of God revealed. He says, "Now the coming of the Lord is in mystery. It's in mystery." He said, uh, we don't know when he's coming, how he's coming, but we know he's coming. And so was all the mysteries of God waiting for the last day. All the mysteries of God, including this one, was waiting for the last day. Then he says a very interesting statement. after it's already been completed. Then he reveals he shows what he's done. He said, "Oh my, never give never gave his full mystery." Now he just hold that. Then he goes on to kind of explain that by saying, "Now it's just like this comparing the seven seals." Now he said when God used Martin Luther for the coming out for the first church in the reformation when God used Martin Luther for the coming out of the first of that church age and when he used John Wesley he gradually brought them out and was revealing and here's the phrase was revealing in them was revealing in Martin Luther and was revealing in John Wesley the church age was revealing the whole age the intent and the purpose was revealing in them that age he says and when we anyone goes back through the Bible now and find out and then he breaks it and then just says but in the last days and then he just breaks it once again and he he says is the reason that it was such a tremendous thing that he spoke here and showed in those seven thunders. And he goes on to the picture in the cloud picture which was on the screen earlier that brother Rod and brother Jeremy and the brothers have been working on. Uh you know uh these things are not really new or strange to us. uh we know a lot of the details but now I guess my question that I'm pondering in my own mind and I don't expect to come out with any you know profound things necessarily but I thought that that I would take and seize upon this Christmas season while the world is remembering and know nothing about his first coming celebrating and spending billions of dollars on on their parties and whatever more all just one big wild celebration about something they know nothing about and that's remembering his first coming and that's what it's degraded to and the Jews don't believe that he has come and the Gentiles who do and whatever more and whatever station the various peoples of the earth whether they're Muslims or Hindus or Buddhists or Christians or Jews or whatever it is they all got their different concept But that doesn't change that doesn't change one thing of God's word. &gt;&gt; God's word is right on track. &gt;&gt; And I I will say that we can be a very confident people. not proud but confident people because as you saw that little clip even of uh I thought how appropriate this morning that little clip of the of the pillar of fire and the confirmation of this hour and then to see that messenger stand in front of the people and to believe the sign to believe the sign. What happens to a people if they do believe the sign? I wonder in the when Jesus was on earth and beginning to move about the people and the Bible says they marvel at the glorious words that fell from his lips. I wonder because I try to put myself back there so I can project myself to where I am now. If I was back there, what what would I have thought at the these are marvelous words. Who is this? And then the revelation comes. This is the Christ. this is the Messiah and you're moving along in in the daytoday activity and the day-to-day things and you're seeing the various supernatural and the miracles and you have, you know, a number right here sitting in the congregation today that were up on the screen. No less supernatural. Every bit is marvelous. The same Jesus Christ yesterday and today and forever. And it's the same Jesus Christ who sent this messenger with this kind of a message veiled himself in it in that messenger and spoke out concerning the events that are taking place. And my question is just how far are we &gt;&gt; in that cycle. I don't want to be one I don't want to be one that turns around looks back and says, "Do you know what? a resurrection's happened &gt;&gt; and I I I wasn't moved by the things before and this somehow this isn't moving me. Oh God, stir me. I don't want to I don't want to ask for a stir then. I want to be stirred now. I want to be upfront now. I want to be passionate about this now. I want to be engaged. I want to be uh as close as I know how to be to God at this time. Amen. &gt;&gt; God works out his will and purpose in us as individuals and he also works out his purpose in us in a corporate form. So when we can say that the coming of the Holy Spirit or the coming of the manifestation of God uh in a certain in a certain time remember if you'll remember this and you have to excuse me I I I pray that God will uh help me to be very very clear but God can bring one person into a into a church a into a whole season of time. He can move in one person. And as far as God is concerned, he has achieved a certain objective by even bringing that in. In other words, here we are a whole body of people and God could raise up one person, one individual, do a certain thing, maybe fulfill a certain scripture and yet God would consider that the whole corporate body has moved to that place. &gt;&gt; You following me? So when God when God in Luther &gt;&gt; was breaking forth the church age, the whole church age had arrived. &gt;&gt; Every individual in the whole country were not was not experiencing what Luther was experiencing. But God had brought that scripture for that season to that moment. &gt;&gt; And then he did it in Wesley. And so and when and when brother Brandham came on the scene with that he may say a gift at one time another time we know that a a a prophet is is more than just a gift. It's not a gift of prophecy. They're born that way. Born so that that sign could be what it was be so visible. Then God considered the whole age to have arrived at that moment. &gt;&gt; You understand? And when the birth of Christ took place, a handful of shepherds heard about it, uh the wise men uh were attracted from two years distance away and traveling and the and the boy becomes a young lad. Uh by that time the world claims to be so smart and I find them very very ignorant. I find them unable to read the scripture and even understand a simple simple statement. And they got wise men in the in the store windows and everything else coming to the manger. They never came to the manger. No scripture said they ever came to a manger. So they came to a child, a young child, probably two years old by that time. Why can't they even get those simple things straight? If they can't get that straight, don't trust your soul to them. &gt;&gt; They came to the young child. But God, even so there was just a few some three wise men, a few shepherds and and and and Simeon and and Mary and Joseph, just a handful of people in the entire population of of the earth. Let me say this right and I want you to get it right. Just a handful of people of the entire population of the earth. I will say corporately that was the human human family &gt;&gt; corporately but individually there was only a handful that actually knew what was happening but in God's mind the entire world had moved to that station &gt;&gt; when William Brham came on the scene. And I use his name because he was the man that God used in this very unusual way. When he came on the scene, I am asking you, I'm asking God, I'm asking my own heart, where does God regard us as a whole corporate, we say Christian community, where did God regard us? At what station are we in the scriptures? And at what place are we as people who believe and know the opening of the word? Where are we in his coming? &gt;&gt; The resurrection has not happened to my knowledge. And brother Brandham says in one place after it's already been completed. You and I are not here to be people who recognize this event after. &gt;&gt; Now I believe brother Brandham is saying that to show to us that most of these important events are recognized after they happen trying to tell us don't be that group. &gt;&gt; We have no reason to be that group. We have no excuse to be that group because you have be been informed. I am informed. &gt;&gt; Are you informed? &gt;&gt; In the Sardisian church age, he said, "And Christ died. He gave his life. that life was to come back upon the church and bring many sons like unto himself unto glory in the resurrection. But as the wheat as the wheat seed had to have a carrier to bring forth multiplied wheat seed even so there had to be a church that would be the carrier of the life. God help me now. Be a carrier of the life of Christ as the blade, the stalk, the tossel, and the husks were the carrier for the seed, not the seed itself. So the church, the church age as it's moved on, the Christian community at large and the multitudes that are probably pounding their the floors of the mall at this moment trying to get their last gift or whatever more or or sitting in in in some church and singing these same carols that you sang and rejoicing in the fact that Christ came, but yet their leaders and their people and the Christian community officially, rejected and spoke reproachfully against this message, against the very doctrine that God was trying to and against the truth that that would move a people into an expectation such as we are. &gt;&gt; We're not saying, oh, you know, the Lord is coming. The Lord is coming. It's way beyond that. He is presently here in another realm. And we had a messenger who who who transcended back and forth that dimension of of the un invisible to the visible back and forth. You people had that. You people have had that sign because God has considered us as a corporate body to have arrived at that point when he did it within the body in one person. &gt;&gt; We've already arrived at that station. We're not waiting for that station. &gt;&gt; It's already happened. We're saying, "Well, it didn't happen to me." It wasn't given to you as an individual, but it was given to us corporately. &gt;&gt; Everything that the disciples, the disciples walked with the Lord, they didn't turn the water into the wine. They didn't multiply the bread and the fishes, but they were identified with it. &gt;&gt; They had arrived at that station. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; They were there. I'm here to announce to you as a group of people, you've arrived there. &gt;&gt; Well, I haven't seen visions. It wasn't given to you, but we have corporately arrived there. &gt;&gt; The secrets of the hearts of men. We aren't doing it. You're not doing it. I'm not. We don't have to do it. God has regarded that this that this corporate body of believers have arrived there and passed that. &gt;&gt; We've gone beyond the physical seeing a sign in the hand. We've gone beyond the revealing of the secrets of the heart of the people. We've gone beyond even the preaching and the opening of the word. Not that the word isn't to be preached, don't get me wrong, but he is the the the waiting for the mysteries of God. We don't have to try to contrive and figure out what the mysteries are. I just say, God, you have done it. &gt;&gt; You know what our big task is? And there's another there's another place uh uh I don't want it to be a negative on you but I want I want it you to think about it in connection with what I'm saying. It's in the same message Christ the mystery of God revealed. He said why do you hunger church? Why do you hunger? And why do you thirst? It's the father. So I speak to any that are here today that have a hunger and you have a thirst. You crave for spiritual things. You might think it's well it's just you or just some place you are in your life or just some events that have been happening that have put you into that kind of feeling that attitude that atmosphere. A prophet has come now to tell you listen to every person. He said it's the father. Oh, if we could only absorb that this moment. It's not just you. It's not something that's happened that's made you feel melancholy or made you feel emotional or made you feel good or made you feel bad. Has nothing to do with that. If you hunger and thirst after righteousness, it's the father. &gt;&gt; He said it's the father. And the father, it's not just the father, but he said the father is trying trying to reveal his hidden secret to you. And what was the secret that brother Brandon was talking about that was in the back part of God's mind that God wanted to reveal himself. He wanted to make himself known. &gt;&gt; He wanted to materialize himself. &gt;&gt; He wanted to become tangible. &gt;&gt; And he wanted it in his family. He said, "Is it trying to reveal his hidden secret to you?" And I search hard. This morning I was almost in a panic because I was trying to find this exact quote, this paragraph, these words because this is what was reverberating within me. But you let it you let you let it get you let them take it out of you. You let Satan take it out of you. I knew that he was saying something. You let something take it out of you. And he says, "But you let so many things get it out of you." And I thought, "Oh, God. Here we are with the hunger. Here we are with the thirst. Here we are in the second coming of Christ. Here we are with the scriptures being unfolded and fulfilled so rapidly. And I've got to stand before the people. And I know that they've come with this hunger and this thirst. This is not merely it's some celebration. And you may have come here because it's a special Christmas season. Let me tell you, you're here because God ordained that you're here. &gt;&gt; You're here because God ordained you want to hear this service. You need to hear this service. You're here because there's something within your heart that that has a hunger for God. And maybe the hunger needs to be uh needs to be increased. Maybe the Holy Spirit needs to really get a hold of it and and give you such a thirst for God. You'll get a passion. You'll get a hunger knowing this message is unfolding. And I've got to be there. I've got to be upfront. I got to be front center. I've got to receive everything. I I resolve within myself. I shall not be one that now looks back &gt;&gt; and says, "Wasn't Elijah supposed to come? Wasn't he even said they'll look back and say, "Wasn't there supposed to be a rapture?" &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; This is truth, friends. &gt;&gt; This is truth. Throughout this congregation and those on the internet, resolve within your heart before God. I will not be one that stands on the other side looking back saying, "Wasn't there supposed to be a rapture?" If &gt;&gt; you want to give yourself a gift, make that promise to your own self before God in this body of witnesses. I shall not be one that looks back. Satan, wasn't there supposed to be? And he said, you let so many things get it out of you. You have it, &gt;&gt; but now he's going to identify some things that you allow &gt;&gt; to get that out of you. &gt;&gt; You have it. You possess it. It is yours. &gt;&gt; The father speaking to you. The father trying to perhaps reveal exactly where we are. But you allow things to get it out of you. And he names them. Your job, your wife. I speak to the wives. You wouldn't for a moment want to be an instrument of the world. that in opposition to Almighty God, the father trying to make himself known and reveal himself to your beloved husband. You wouldn't want to be one. Well, I'm a believer. I love this. But, you know, it's just the things of life. And you can engage your husband in the home and become so immersed in just life itself. And he doesn't stop there. And let your husband husbands you might be saying, "Brother Biscll, this is the last kind of message we expected for a Christmas message. This is my Christmas message. Husbands, you wouldn't would you want to create an atmosphere? When the prophet told us what kind of atmosphere you're creators, you can actually create an atmosphere in the home that brings the presence of God into the home. husbands, spiritual leaders, priests, the example to set the example. Many times I feel I set a poor example in the home even for my wife. But we are we have a charge &gt;&gt; and now it speaks he speaks of a husband or you let your children Parents can become so swallowed up in their child or their children or or what is involved with their children and and and so swallowed up and so swamped with their children and their activities and where they are and what they must do and all the rest of it that we allow we let that get it out of us. You have it, &gt;&gt; but that causes it to deteriorate, &gt;&gt; causes it to diminish within us. What we really need to do, you say, well, let let's let's move on from that. Well, I can't because it goes on to say, and the cares of this world, and this world is a world of cares. &gt;&gt; And I can say, we're not going to ever be done with the cares. We've got cares and cares and more cares and more concerns. And the more uh the more media, the more contact you can have with one another, the more you read and the more uh you see in a newspaper or see on the on your computer or television, I hope not, or hear on the radio and all of these things, then we we become so absorbed and so swallowed up and then I crash into our bed at night totally wearied and wore out by the cares of this life and just the burdens of this life. And I say this most important of all things here. God sends everything as brother Brown says on that message deep call to the deep. He says God sends his word. He sends his holy spirit. He sends his preachers. He sends his gifts. He sends his messenger. He sends his prophet. He sends his sign. He sends a pillar of fire. What more can he do? &gt;&gt; What more can he do to get our attention? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We ought to be turning and saying, "God, you've done everything you can. I give myself. I take my I take time. I think about this. I'm going to turn my even in my job or even in my duties, I'm going to have my mind upon you. Going to be pondering things." &gt;&gt; Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even whatever you're engaged in, you don't have to allow there will be cares, but you you don't have to allow the cares to take it out of you. &gt;&gt; But while you're in the cares of this life, for we will have the cares of this life. Our mind is set upon God. &gt;&gt; Our mind is set upon where we're at. Our mind is set upon the fulfillment of the scriptures of the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll just tell you privately often I and my wife, we sit in silence and we'll eat in a lot of silence and even I'm conscious I should be saying something but I haven't got a lot to say because my mind is so absorbed and so caught up and I'll just be thinking about one phrase but you let the world you let so many things get it out of you. And I'm sitting there eating at the breakfast table or sitting there last night and I tell you, but you let so many things get it out of you. Get it out of you. Oh God. Oh God. What is it that you're wanting to say to us? &gt;&gt; We're not going to completely eradically radically change our lifestyle. We are here. This is the age we're in. This is a this is the real world, friends. You're not going to change. You're not going to change the whole society. You're not going to change civilization. And we're not interested in we're interested in one thing in in this individual yourself. Number one, moving in the direction that God would have you move and affecting anyone you can affect, influencing whoever you can influence. But keep moving in that direction with a determination that no devil in hell can break. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. said, "So the scripture says, "And she brought forth her firstborn, her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for him in the end." She she was a long time coming. this one Mary, this virgin and the one that she was bringing was a long time coming before the foundation of the world. And last Sunday I took a lot of time and I won't do that now. But while this earth was an old star spinning and created some gases and created some uh calcium and some pot ash and some elements and so on and the prophet says what was he doing? Ask the question he was making you &gt;&gt; to be here knowing that you would be lost. And at the same time when he was creating you, he was also putting the elements for a earth that he knew would become cursed. That he under his own decree would curse the earth and it would bring forth thistles and thorns and so on. He knew it would become cursed. And he knew in his mind that he's going to bring forth the elements of that. Oh, this is a Christmas story to me, friends. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I haven't got the time, but I would I would like to I would like to even have you read in your own time the genealogies of Joseph which are in Matthew. And it says in Matthew that Joseph was the son of was the son of uh Jacob. And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary. And if you take the genealogies in Luke, it says that Joseph was and the and the word son of is not in the Greek. It says simply that Joseph was of Heli and Heli obviously was not Joseph's father. It says in Matthew, "And Jacob begat Joseph." So there's not a contradiction. And I have another scripture which I haven't got time to go into, but it the scriptures also refer to a son-in-law as the son. And so now Jacob, Joseph had to be the son-in-law of Heli, which brings Mary, Mary directly into the lineage of David through Nathan. And it brings Joseph directly into the lineage. They were both directly out of the lineage of David. So that the one coming forth, Jesus, from Mary, could be called the son of David. &gt;&gt; Both of those lineages. Now that that is really striking because the reason it goes all the way back God, you know, they had wars and troubles and fightings and all kinds of things taking place and famines and bondage and and deliverances and on and on coming down. All God is seeing like a dual vision. He's singing one line coming down here all the way down. All the way down until a certain moment of time and she's just a girl. She's just 15 years old and she comes and now she's in the world. God considers the whole world, the whole earth has moved to that junction of the first coming. Nobody knows about it. But God the creator has moved the whole the whole of humanity to that junction and conceived in the womb of that young girl by the Holy Spirit begins to form a body and she eats of the normal food of the wheat and whatever more. And what is God Almighty doing? He's the one that let the old star spin billions of years ago to bring some gases and pot ash and calcium and whatever more. And now he's drawing that right up through a body, the body of Mary the virgin. drawing that very food up into her body to form a body of cursed earth that he himself will dwell in and take control back of the earth and claim it back in a perfect redemption. &gt;&gt; Think of it. Think of it. He's taking and that's why the scripture says that Christ became a curse for us. He took of the cursed earth and dwelt in it and brought that earth under subjection to the Holy Spirit to the spirit of God that was in him. And and he didn't merely live that life for himself, but he said it's expedient for you that I go because when I go, then the spirit of God will come into you and you'll be like he's a son of God. You'll be sons of God. You'll be daughters of God. You'll be a God people. &gt;&gt; God will be in the flesh again. We've gone through this process. We're going through a process. And God took this process of trillions of years perhaps bringing up bringing up a body of the earth. And that's what's that's what Christmas is all about. Here's a body. And the word was made flesh and we beheld his glory as the only be of the only begotten of the father. He stood on the earth and it's not enough to remember that. It's not enough to celebrate that. The real celebration is that the that God came into our flesh. &gt;&gt; That's part of the process. &gt;&gt; And he would move. Now this uh it came from an individual. It became a corporate body and the church was born and the spirit of God came into the church. And now the church moves through its hundreds of years and 2,000 years and coming to the end after it's had a birth pain of the first world war and another birth pain of a second world war and man from eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil has devised a means by which he can destroy himself and he can destroy the entire earth by his own knowledge and he's come to a critical place. And at that time, God comes and demonstrates a knowledge that man knows nothing about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In a human body stands there, a redeemed body, one born by sin, but one who's come to full maturity. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In fact is it had to be that Christ through him would wave a sheath over the people to declare there are more like that in the earth. God in the flesh. &gt;&gt; And people want to back away from it. If it's anything less than that, then you have to have a new definition. &gt;&gt; But the definition is it's God in the flesh. I in you and you in me. I in the father and the father in me. And it's that day and that is oneness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he said the church really had birth pains. He said the church really is in birth pains tonight again for the deliverance of the son of God to come again. 65. All of our theologians, all of our symptoms, uh, systems, all of our denominations has rotted &gt;&gt; right out from under us. &gt;&gt; So, we are in birth pains. &gt;&gt; And a message from God always throws the church into heavier pains. The message through the church into heavier pains. I listened to a testimony last night of a couple that sits here in the service this morning and the birth pains and how they went on a search in another country on another continent. But how they went on a search and they searched here and they searched there and they tried this and they tried that and both of them Catholics, both of them died in the wool. Catholics, they knew it wasn't there and they're going on a search and it's just so amazing. You can just see how the conception takes place and God arranges it. They're just one person even got so close that they were fellowshipping in a group and the group would use the prophet's message but would absolutely refuse to tell them where they got those things. And finally one man out of all of them that they meet they bang here bang there you know bump into this one bump into that one go into this church into that movement into this one and then finally finally all there's one person says the right thing and then it all happens the church is in birth pains again heavier pains but after a while. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. After a while, &gt;&gt; but after a while, she's going to be delivered of a bride. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't stop there. After a while, she'll be delivered of a bride who the church will be delivered of a bride. In other words, God will consider the entire corporate church to have brought forth a bride because they were a carrier. They were only a carrier and they brought forth a bride. And but he doesn't end the he doesn't end the sentence there. He said brought delivered of a bride that'll bring forth Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; to his bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is it all right? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This message was to forrun the second coming of Jesus Christ. And obviously, we're in that cycle. I said a moment ago, Satan will use every possible means he can to dull our expectations or to distract us with other things that seem more urgent, more demanding. taking our attention and seeking to fully occupy us. This we must resist. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do I have a a complete 100% union on that? This we must resist. &gt;&gt; We and I say in all truth. We can do our duties. We can do our studies. We can bear up under our responsibilities. And we can do all of that. I want to announce to you, you can do all of that without allowing it to take it out of you. It's the father. &gt;&gt; I want you to look inwardly right now. &gt;&gt; And ask yourself, do I have a real thirst and hunger for God? Something more than just a casual, well, yeah, I like, you know, I like going to church. That's not what I'm asking you. Yeah, I have my friends there. That's not what I'm asking. I'm asking you, do you have a thirst for God deep down after you pull everything else aside? So that thirst for God. Oh God, I as the heart panth after the waterbrooks so pneth my soul after you. After all of these things fade away and I push them all aside, there's a hunger. There's a craving for holiness, for justice, for truth, &gt;&gt; for holiness, purity. There's a hunger for it. If there's a hunger for it, I can announce to you from the message, it's the father. &gt;&gt; That's not just you. That's the father. &gt;&gt; And he's trying by that hunger to move you in the direction he wants you because he wants to reveal himself to you. That's the secret he had in the back part of his mind before the foundation of the world. I'm going to get a people. I'm going to create within them a certain appetite, a certain hunger, a thirst that nothing can satisfy. Nothing can satisfy. Material things can never satisfy it. Uh a a beautiful life can never satisfy it. Only I can satisfy it. [Applause] And Satan, my arch enemy, he's going to throw everything dazzling in front of them and he cares and worries and troubles and sorrows and and griefs and all kinds of things. I'll throw it all in front of them to try and get it out of them. &gt;&gt; But I have a little preacher that'll come on a Sunday morning or another preacher that'll come and alert them and and cause them to see it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I pray this. I've never prayed before. God, let let it be your breath that comes this morning over this pulpit. Your breath, &gt;&gt; which is the very inspiration of God. And let that breath be breathed into you so you can go out these doors and say, I can never be the same person again. [Applause] And the word was made flesh &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us in a body of earth cursed earth. The second Adam Jesus Christ standing on the earth for the purpose of reclaiming the earth. How beautiful. How beautiful. And the angel is commissioned prophet said what the first Adam lost the second Adam Christ restored again &gt;&gt; to the human race. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you part of the human race? &gt;&gt; You believe that vindicated word? What Adam lost a second Adam has restored it back to the church to the human race. As I said a moment ago, not only was Jesus coming down, maybe not what not what the Jews anticipated. He's going to come down. The great red carpet's going to go on into the temple. I don't know what they anticipated. And I know speaking to you today, I know from my own experience, if we talk about the coming of Jesus Christ, we have some hundreds of people here, we've got all kinds of ideas &gt;&gt; about how it's going to be and how he's going to come and, you know, and and uh the word says cloud. So, some says it got to be a cloud and well, you know, scientifically we have all kinds of problems with that. It comes with the cloud here. What about the people on the other side of the earth and all kind? Well, is it going to be, you know, over a period of 24 hours or what's Oh my goodness. I tell you, a lot of this is fairy tales. &gt;&gt; A lot of it is just ideas that have drifted. We we we've uh we've got them by osmosis from the church world and the denominations and what people have said and what we've been taught and all kinds of things. Then God comes and begins to tell us that it's in a mystery. The coming's in a mystery and and and these are the things. And I'll tell you the prophet of God, he was very very clear. And yet it will always be a mystery to us. Do you know why? These human minds cannot grasp what God and how he's going to do things. &gt;&gt; I've thought about our bodies. The body that I'm going to step into and there's going to be destruction. You know what? You know what the prophet speaks about and I'm getting off my subject now but he speaks about the great tribulation and the things that are going to happen and then says you know we don't go any place and we're right here and and how are we going to do that? Well, you know how one way I'll just tell you that satisfies myself. You're going to be your body your body your theophony body is absolutely indestructible. &gt;&gt; You you you could stand in that body and have have a nuclear bomb land two inches from you. It wouldn't do a thing to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz one is material and one is of this world and one is of this civilization and you're in another civilization. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have a body like his glorious body. &gt;&gt; Go through that wall if I need to. You will, too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you need to be in another place, you'll be there. That's not a pipe dream. That's the body that Christ had. &gt;&gt; And you'll have a body like under his glorious body. I'll have a body like his glorious body and there can be tumults and there can be destruction and there can be absolute uh uh just uh uh in incredible things happening destruction of every kind. It won't touch the believer. &gt;&gt; That body is from another creation and you already have that creation within you. You are a new creature in Christ Jesus. The scripture says so. Do you believe that? Jesus said, Jesus said, "That which is born of the flesh is what?" &gt;&gt; Flesh. Say it again. &gt;&gt; Flesh. But that which is born of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Is spirit. &gt;&gt; Didn't say spirit and flesh. It's spirit. &gt;&gt; We have a spiritual life, a spiritual body already growing inside. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he's got a body like this one when it dropped out of our mother's womb. Here we were subject to the elements of this world. But we have another body. In fact, is the craving that's in you right now, the hunger that's in you right now caused me to come to this pulpit today because the prophet said it's your body on the other side crying out for this element. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you don't like what you're hearing, you're the one that caused it. &gt;&gt; It's a medicine that God called for it to come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My &gt;&gt; so all of this if I could just have you to see in the corporate in the corporate structure God saw all through these church ages just coming down. I'm just going to take a moment to quickly try and dramatize it a wee bit. And now he came down into the church by the Holy Ghost. And the church is born. And the very life of Jesus now is in the earth corporately. And God is just watching that life, watching it coming down in the corporate body. And that corporate body moves down, moves into the ages of the martyrs. The life keeps going and the world is trying to extinguish it and the world is at great conflict with it. But the life keeps moving down. Then the age of the man come and darkness came and political movements and laws came into place and they made decrees and you can't have that Bible in your home. But the life kept moving through that darkness and God God and then and then the other side of that darkness it came to a certain season a certain time and God himself then he he reveals in revelation he puts it in a man and that man is Luther and now the whole of humanity is ri arrived to a certain junction and he begins to display in that man and the others begin to catch it the believers begin to catch the revelation moves on and then he gets comes into the age of of another age of justification moves on, steps into a man and begins to manifest in that individual what is taking place and where we are in time. And then comes the last age. He says the messenger always come at the end of the age had a great outpouring and gifts and manifestation and speaking in tongues and signs and wonders and supernatural things. Hadn't had anything like that uh for for centuries and centuries. Now we moved. Are you listening to me? Now we move to that time. See, it's like a little study. And we come to that time. Now it is a different season. It's not a reformer that's needed. Listen closely. Not a reformer could do it. It's got to be a a a God prophet. &gt;&gt; Not a a a prophet of God. It has to be that. And it has to be one who's who is the veil so that God can now bring it to a whole different a different junction a different kind. I might be misunderstood but I would say behind the skin of brother Brandham behind the skin God was hiding behind that skin. And when he opened his mouth God spoke out of his mouth and not through his eyes. It wasn't in his eyes. I've been closer than I am to this boy here when brother Brandham was having visions and looked over my head and told me exactly what was happening and what was wrong with people, what was taking place. And I looked at those eyes. I thought those eyes are not like a human's eyes that are looking darting around back and forth. He's looking into some other place, some other realm. God had a vessel that could look into eternity. Tell a woman what the doctor said. He could tell her, uh, I see the doctor's report something in in in the past and read that report to that woman. Now, that was just to that woman. Now, what about you and I? What about the report we need to hear? And where are we in this season? What kind of God would we have would send us this kind of ministry? Send us this kind of uh this kind of a voice. What kind of a God have you got that would leave the most important and the most significant thing and leave it all shrouded and covered and bring us to this time? But I can't tell you. I won't tell you. I'll leave you floundering around. That's not the God we have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know what this is meaning to you, but it means a whole lot to me. &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to be too much longer. I don't want to wear you out, but I all I can tell you friends, I I'm just on page two. I have a lot in my heart. And it centers on that one theme. Where are you? Where am I? Where are we? And for me to even think that I can come here and you'd be I would hate to think that you would allow other things to crowd in and you to be be distracted at this incredible moment. I won't preach this again next Christmas if we're still here. I'm not worried and I'm not trying to think what I'm going to say. I'm just watching. The Bible starts out and the first time image appears in the Bible is in Genesis 1 and 26. Let us make man in our image. And the next verse mentions it about three times. When you come to the book of Revelation, there's not one time that image refers to God. Every single time it is the image of the beast, the image to the beast, the image of the beast, the beast's image. And every time 10 times the word image appears in the book of Revelation. And every time it refers to the image of the beast from the image that God had standing on the earth. Now I'm going to I've got to consummate my message pretty quickly. From the time God said, "Let us make man." And he made man. And a God man stood on the earth in the image of God made he him and God life in him. And then the fall and then the prophet says and I had a I had to look for this one too. Said God wasn't willing to leave his masterpiece lay down in the dust. He wasn't willing to leave his his image, his masterpiece lay broken down in the dust. But he be quickly to build up again another masterpiece. &gt;&gt; And that is what from Adam's time. Oh, I wish I had a big platform. I'd demonstrate it. from Adam's time here. God on all God of the universe, but he's got his focus on a a little speck of dust called the earth cuz it's the womb for his life. And in that amongst that, he's got some little creatures that are crawling. But the great God from the back part of his mind wanted to manifest. He wanted to show himself. He wanted to become tangible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wanted to materialize himself. He wanted a family. &gt;&gt; Where's the house that you build me? Where's the household? He speaks to Isaiah. Where is my household? Where's my children? &gt;&gt; Says the earth is my foottool. The heavens, my hands have made, but where is my family? Where's my household? Where do I dwell? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God watches and the and he's got a son and he fellowshipped with him and his bride, his wife and they fall and he starts quickly. He won't leave them there. He starts quickly to build them up &gt;&gt; and Seth and Enos &gt;&gt; come and then uh the lineage comes comes Noah found a man perfect but the sons of God have taken the children of daughters of men going to destroy this going to destroy this world and he comes up out of the ark and keeps continuing on moving on through centuries centuries of time centuries ies and along through this humanity moving moving along God's focus. I'm going to come. I'm going to come. I'm going to redeem that earth. I'm going to take a part of that very earth cursed earth and I'm going to bring it all the way to redemption. I'm going to take it in a body. I'm going to take it by the word of God, by my own decree. I'll live out every decree, everyone. And I'll take that cursed body to the to the cross and through death. And I'll slay death by taking it through death. And and then my own spirit raise up that body of clay out of there. And it will not be in the tomb. &gt;&gt; And they'll come looking for it. It won't be there. But at the same time, he's also following another lineage on down from this from this man to that man on the way down. And finally, here's a little girl. At the same time that what is in his mind now, he's got a little girl there and and and he doesn't teach her a bunch of things. He gives her his word and she believes his word and there's conceived in her womb. Hallelujah. And God, are you with me? &gt;&gt; God so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son. His son lived in a body of cursed earth &gt;&gt; in order that he could give you a body that's not of the earth cursed &gt;&gt; and he's bringing forth redemption and then after that and I've got to got to move quickly but I don't want to lose my main thought and he's moving on down in a corporate that was corporate that was the people that was humanity that was even before Even before Israel become a nation, even before he talked to Abraham, even before he told him he'd have a son, God had in his mind redemption. &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring it down. I'm going to move it on down. And he's got his mind focused on that. And his mind focused on see that would be a carrier of the word. And then he comes, he goes through his life, his death, his burial, his resurrection, and his ascension. And this same Jesus that you've seen go will come in like manner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit comes down into the church. I need to take you so you get my my thought. Comes down to the church and now it's a corporate body. What was in the corporal body of Jesus Christ, a single body, is now in the corporal body, the church. and that but it's the same life only now it's in a different place and it moves through that corporal body all the way through all the way through and then there comes a time and he's got to identify where he's at at a certain junction so he comes and he makes his revelation in a man then he comes to the next junction in a man and the next junction in a man in the next junction a man but in the last one in the last junction it has to be very different &gt;&gt; this has to be very different. I wish I could convey to you where I personally think Jesus Christ was. He came as close physically as he possibly could in the ministry of God's prophet. &gt;&gt; That's what I believe. He came as close to being in a corporal body as he could without coming and standing. He would have had to break the plan. The plan is I will come again and receive you unto myself. That where notice how the scripture now listen to all you people got question your mind. Notice the scripture. The scripture is the absolute. I will come again. And anyone in the church world will say that's the second coming. All right. Well, let's just take it. And I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also. Not that I'm coming where you are dwelling, but I'm and and he had to come so close that he would attract the people. And these people that begin to see this Christ, they're able to look beyond the human veil, &gt;&gt; they're able now, they begin to realize because the human veil is saying he's become word again &gt;&gt; and this is his word coming &gt;&gt; and the people are gripped with the word. The people see him in the word. We see it clearly. This is a word coming. This is the form of the word. He's taken on another form. &gt;&gt; And we believe it and confess it and are baptized unto it. And the spirit of God comes and quickens that word. &gt;&gt; And the bride now is the wrapping, &gt;&gt; the wrapping &gt;&gt; of the glorious gift. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a simple wrapping. &gt;&gt; It's a humble wrapping. It's a wrapping filled with mistakes. It's a wrapping filled with error. &gt;&gt; Some of us feel like we're recycled. &gt;&gt; But it's a wrapping. &gt;&gt; Oh, he wrapped himself in such simplicity in his first coming. Wrapped himself in such simplicity that when he came and he was coming great with child, &gt;&gt; it was him said they went down to Egypt. &gt;&gt; They went down to Egypt because of him. &gt;&gt; They went to be taxed because of him. &gt;&gt; It was him that was going down there &gt;&gt; and here she was a little girl pregnant. And the first thing was in that very religious nation, the whole religious nation of Israel is going a little girl, teenage girl pregnant. She was the wrapping at that moment &gt;&gt; and the wrapping was reproached, &gt;&gt; spoken evil against. &gt;&gt; And when he came and even grew to be a man, the the reproach was still hanging there. And the uh great religious leader says, "We be not born of fornication." They still held that you're born of fornication. Your mother was pregnant as a teenage girl. She bore it. She was the wrapping. And then the God was wrapped in human flesh. &gt;&gt; And there was no beauty &gt;&gt; that we would desire him. &gt;&gt; If he was here today, you would not find him charismatic, &gt;&gt; but gracious words would come from his lips &gt;&gt; and he would speak the same message that we have spoken today. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; And so today he's wrapped in utter simplicity. But those people, yeah, that cult, they fall dead. I say, "Praise God." &gt;&gt; Thank God I can bear his reproach. &gt;&gt; And that's why the Apostle Paul said, "Let us go unto him outside of the camp bearing his reproach." I say to all of you people here, you want to be glorified in God that you're able to bear his reproach. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a blessed thing to be able to bear his reproach. &gt;&gt; We are now. We're now. And we're not going to try to make this a a glamorous wrapping. I get more worried over people seeing, oh my, you people have had some success. I don't want people to come here because of success. I don't want people to come here because God is using the place or using the brothers or whatever more. We we we don't want to attract people for those things. We want to attract people because they have a hunger and thirst after God and that they will be buried in the in the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; And so I'm concluding and listen friends, don't get lost in the numbers. &gt;&gt; I'll just go back a couple thousand years. Just a couple thousand years. I would say back from the beginnings of the and way into the eternities, God's focus was on the moment that he would send his son as a sacrifice to redeem the world. And once that had taken place, now one has to come out of this cursed earth that will be a wife to my son, &gt;&gt; a bride for the bridegroom, &gt;&gt; a wife for the lamb, &gt;&gt; who will be worthy? And God kept his focus on that life and brought it all through. But I I say to you in the name of the Lord, his focus was right on this time, &gt;&gt; right on this junction. &gt;&gt; And a whole lot of scriptures scriptures while you're sitting here that may are in the process of being fulfilled right now. &gt;&gt; And so I want you to be able to leave here and ask yourself the question, where are we? Where am I in this process of the coming of Jesus Christ? God has allowed me to have ears to hear the last messenger's voice, &gt;&gt; to be gripped by the awesome vindication. &gt;&gt; What is your purpose, Lord? &gt;&gt; Help me, oh God, to move move right into the right up into the realm. Help me to be so sensitive. Help me to be so conscious. May this be the thing that's uppermost in my mind even while I'm doing my daily duties and whatever more. And may your life I pray in the name of Jesus Christ be so ordered in your home in your work and in your service to Christ in the body of Christ. May that be the guiding light and the directing the directing force. And we speak about you know beautiful star of Bethlehem. I pray that that beautiful star which is hovers over this message. It hovers over his word. I pray that beautiful star will be your guiding light through this world that's very very dark and it's dark out there. grows darkness upon the people, but upon you it shall be light. &gt;&gt; Isn't he lovely? &gt;&gt; Let's bow in prayer. Oh, gracious and loving father. We have read and I have related. I have rehearsed what I believe is your word to the people. Why do you hunger, church? That's the father trying to reveal himself to you. And Lord, throughout this day, there will be many different activities. Homes will be visited, some Christian, some religious, some not religious. People are going different directions. But in in the midst of all of this, oh lovely one, who was the image of the invisible God and in that image you sat and there was a woman ill-famed woman and she saw you with dirty feet and saw how how wrong that was and she washed your feet with her tears. Lord, there may be there may be someone here, no doubt is that's away from you that has perhaps not denied the faith, but they have not lived in the faith. They're not where they should be. And they've disregarded you and disregarded your wooing and put it off for another time when things will be different in their life. But oh God, time has moved on. Weeks and months and years have moved on. I pray you will brand their minds with a flame of fire of the hour that we're in and you'll take something that's been spoken today and anchor it in their heart, in their soul, so they cannot move away from it. And I pray Lord again today there'll be tears of repentance and they will wash the feet oh God wash the feet of this lovely one Christ they will come with such sincerity and even now may their heart turn into an altar as they give themselves and say Lord I give myself to you father I'd be so rewarded that would be the only reward I would desire if I can cause someone to surrender themselves to you so completely, Lord. No doubt there are those that will be honest with themselves, say, "Oh, my enemy has worked so hard to try to get it out of me. I'm not going to make a bunch of excuses. I'm not going to blame it on other people. I'm not going to blame it on other situations. I'm simply going to say, Lord, from this time, from this day on, I will listen to that voice that is within me. Your calling and your seeking to make yourself known to me. I wonder how many would like to stand and say, I want to make that resolve. The world is a very deceptive place. I want to give my all this morning. I want to be that not that carrier of the seed but the seed itself. Lord Jesus, for this these that are standing, these oh God that they have a I believe the same craving that I have this morning. We just want to say to you, take us Lord as your disciples, your children. We both want to serve you and we want to love you. We want to be an expression that is so clear. &gt;&gt; We want to be an unmistakable voice. We want you to live in us. &gt;&gt; So that people will see you unquestionably, unmistakably be able to declare, I see Jesus Christ in you. Let it be, oh God. And all that are visiting us and that are here, I pray their hearts will be deeply stirred. in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. All that I have. All that I am. All that I am. All that I am. All I shall ever be. Can I be the I [Music] surrender to thee. &gt;&gt; The sister that's being baptized, perhaps you'll go and just make ready to be baptized now. And we'll have the baptismal in just a few moments. Can we take this time to meditate, to ponder in this quietness because I know that when you leave here, it's going to be a hustle. It's going to be a whatever going to be lost to occupy your thoughts under the influence of the Holy Spirit. under the influence of the word which I've spoken today and I felt so I pray that you'll not be able to forget it. I'm praying that the Holy Spirit will just keep [Music] bringing it to you that he'll make it a constant something you're constantly thinking about. If I read my scripture right and read the message correct, the bride of Jesus Christ is not merely the carrier, not the carrier anymore. the bride of Jesus Christ. You people standing here, God brought you here to this season so that he could actually dwell in you, actually live in your flesh, live in your body. Do you believe that much? as he saw Mary come on down through the centuries. As he saw the very life that would come down and be that body that would be created in her, that same God ordained you to this very moment of time so that he focused on his own life coming down, down, down. You think that he's interested for a moment in all of this sin and confusion and darkness? Do you think he's interested in what's happening around the country? Not a bit. Not a bit. He's focused on one. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you're understanding me. &gt;&gt; Why was it just a few shepherds? I'm trying to say, why was it just a handful of people? Because it's going to be few in the end time. We might be a few hundred people. We're just a handful of people. That's all. We're not a lot of people. We're just a handful of people, but God ordained before the foundation of the world and especially since Pentecost. And he just follows that life on down on down. It'll come to a Luther junction, a Wesley junction, a Pentecost junction. It'll come to the end and there'll be a messenger. I'm going to dwell in him. &gt;&gt; I'm going to show I'm going to show the world what I can do &gt;&gt; through a fully adopted son. Friends, God didn't bring you here on the scene so we could rem re remain a bunch of infants. &gt;&gt; Infants in the scripture. &gt;&gt; He brought us here so we could be mature men and women. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I got this little problem or I got this little trouble with this sister or this brother. I say nonsense. &gt;&gt; We got a higher calling. &gt;&gt; None of these things are to afflict us. mature sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; One that can look at a hardship, look at a reproach and say, "Oh, God just sent it my way. It's good for me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What What are you here? Brother Rod used that phrase. Why are we here? It's really amazing. Brother Rod, this last week, first part of the week, I thought the same thing. What am I doing here? Where are we at? You say, "Well, Brother Biser, you said that several times. I'll probably say it a lot more times cuz I want to know not only today and not only tonight, but tomorrow and next week. I want to know where we're at in the word." And Holy Spirit, move us. Move us. Move us. Keep moving me on. Keep making yourself known. Brother Brandham says why we're here. Why are we here? Said we're here to help you. I'm taking this personally and to this congregation and all that are listening. [Music] We're here to help you. If if we see that God promised these things, If we see that God has promised these things, we're here to see them come to pass. &gt;&gt; We're here to represent the Lord Jesus Christ and his resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not here for doctrines. We're here to worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; We're here to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; We're here to influence Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're here to influence somebody. &gt;&gt; And we are here to identify ourselves as your servants as a true witness of the Bible. &gt;&gt; And we're here to turn our attention towards eternal things and to the life that lays beyond this mortal reach. That's why we're here. And we are claiming by grace and love that we are here to represent. I want the congregation to say amen. We're here to represent the bride and believing associate with him in his kingdom. I'm here to represent the bride of Jesus Christ and to declare by my presence here each one of us that we are associated in the kingdom of God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All that I am, oh All [Applause] [Music] [Music] the I [Music] surrender to thee. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? Wonderful. Wonderful. Isn't Jesus my Lord? Wonderful. My eyes have seen earus. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; You know the Lord is present. So very present. Do you sense him? Amen. &gt;&gt; And that realm is so mystical and so wonderful and Sister Vanessa [Music] while I was in the midst of hearing the prophet speak to a woman and he spoke with power and authority and told her to go and be healed and your you came to my thoughts and I said let it be &gt;&gt; for Vanessa as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our God &gt;&gt; is the same &gt;&gt; yesterday, today and forever. And why should we expect anything less? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's alive. &gt;&gt; Give him glory. &gt;&gt; This is what he's here for. He's not a god of wood or stone. &gt;&gt; He's a god of the supernatural &gt;&gt; and he's worthy of all of our life. He's worthy of all of our energy. What do you say, young man? Is he worthy of everything? Then give him everything. I say in the name of the Lord, young ladies, give him everything. Is he worth everything? Give him everything. Is he worth our families? Give him our families. Hallelujah. He's worth everything. Hold back nothing from him. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. God bless you, brother John. You may be seated. [Music] Amen. God bless you this afternoon. I'm just standing in the water with Marlene Barton and I was just uh preparing for uh this afternoon and this uh resurrection that we're going to have this death, burial, and resurrection. I was thinking it wasn't just going to be for Marlene, but I felt for all of us also it was an opportunity to recognize that in it was in this season of the year that the Messiah was revealed to people like us. And it was at the same time that uh Sister Marlene actually it was several weeks ago that she uh had asked about baptism. We've just been waiting. Uh she's been coming to the assembly since August and has been affected by the word of God and she she desires the Holy Spirit. And it was at the time just a couple weeks ago that I was also listening to why it had to be shepherds. And there was certain words that brother Brandham was using about the shepherds of why that the word was revealed to them and why it was that that certain ones were the ones that that God made the message known to. And it reminded me also of in the scripture when there was an invitation to come to the feast and those that were bidden didn't want to come. So the word went out to go to the highways and go to the byways and get those that would receive the message. But there were certain words that brother Brandham used in that message why it had to be shepherds describing the shepherds. And I thought it was so uh pertinent, sister Marleene, not just for yourself but for all of us as believers. Brother Brandham said they were humble, they were uneducated, they were common, they were unlearned, they were poor, they were simple, they were untrained, they were uncultured, they were illiterate, they were called the ignorant and unlearned, they were common, and they were people of low degree. &gt;&gt; But that's who God revealed the word to. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I was thinking how God passed by all the trained, all the cultured, all the people that thought they had it together and has revealed himself to Sister Marlene. And I thought, "What an incredible day today on Christmas Eve when Sister Marleene was asked, "What would be the greatest gift thing that you could have?" And and her response was is she wanted to be baptized. She wanted to give that gift within her life back to Jesus Christ. I feel that we're right back again, not 2,000 years ago, but we're finding oursel this morning to some more shepherds &gt;&gt; and to a lady that has found her place in the word of God. Sister Marine. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I became in believe I be coming in several months to church and the greatest gift I can have for Christmas is being baptized in the holy name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we agree together &gt;&gt; that this great spirit that's been around her for all these months now since August would just come fluttering right inside and give her the desire of her heart. Amen. Heavenly Father, I believe your focus is here this morning. Lord, you've chosen to find humble and honest hearts, sincere hearts that would just simply respond to the message, respond to the word that has come. And Sister Marlene has it upon her heart to surrender herself. She's repented. She desires a greater change within her life. Not to just see it in others, but to see it in her own life. So, we are here today as believers also with her to honor her request and ask that Jesus Christ and that great dove of God would be born within this manger today. That the Holy Spirit, Father, would fill our sister Marlene with the Holy Spirit. This promise as we read in the book of Acts, which is unto you and to your children, and to those that are a far off, and to as many as the Lord our God shall call. And you've been calling. You've been dealing. There's been something coming upon our sister Marlene. And we pray, Father, that that something would come inside of her and cause this predestinated seed to be born within her life. Lord, you've come in our day as you did to shepherds long ago to us poor, maybe illiterate, not knowing everything, untrained and uncultured. But we are asking that this gift would be open this morning, this afternoon within our sister Marlene's life. Bless her. Continue to unfold yourself within her life. Reveal yourself in a greater way from this moment on. May Lord everything about this experience be so real to sister Marlene Lord that this daughter of yours could come to her perfection in Jesus Christ. We bless her in Jesus name. Amen. Sister Marlene according to your desire and your willingness to be identified and married to Jesus Christ. I now baptize you in true Christian baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bless you. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Bless you. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, I'll have you stand. [Music] I don't need any gift from the world or any gift of any kind. I already received the gift. Not only Christ but his promise [Music] I will come and receive you to myself that where I am there you may be also to me that's the most wonderful thing.

It's good to just be quiet before God to give him this complete surrender of ourselves, dedicate ourselves to him. Hallelujah. Brother Lance, God bless you. Our gracious heavenly father, we want to say Lord that there is no one like you. You are the one that's more than able to minister and to touch lives and change lives. And Father, every opportunity that we have to sit at your feet, we realize it's an opportunity to come to a place where we can know you more and be affected by your presence. And Lord, as we have gathered even this morning and we have sat and we have listened to the word of God, we're praying, Father, that word that has been ministered by scripture, &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; will not &gt;&gt; return void. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But Lord Jesus, it will reach forth with divine hands &gt;&gt; and change lives. Father, what you do, you do well. And so, Lord, we want to humble ourselves to the word of God. And we know as we humble ourselves, the very effects of that word will take place within our lives. Lord, I pray you bless this congregation. We pray that you bless them for the desire that they have within their heart to know you. And Jesus, we believe even as the scripture hath said that they that hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled. Father, these are not the words of a man. This is not just something that we can speak and rattle uh through through through uh words that have no meaning. But Father, these are your words. These people shall be filled. And Lord, may that filling continue even as we leave this afternoon and we uh we enjoy each other's companionship. People will be visiting family. Father, may the the grace of God just go with us. May you bless the people. And Father, may above all things, you remain the number one priority in our lives. In Jesus Christ's name, we pray that you continue to minister to us, Father. Amen. And amen. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; We dismiss you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Would remind you there's no service this evening here. There are service on Wednesday as normal. And next Sunday is Sunday morning. And the evening will be our our watch night service. We'll be starting at 9:00. But I would urge you to come a little early. The place will be f full. So you want to come a little bit early. In the meantime, have a glorious time. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. [Music] Good job. [Music]
