[2:12] six.
[2:14] And she told this guy who pulled her
[2:16] out, pulled the kids out. He was just

[2:29] old and her little brother is six.
[2:33] And she told the people said uh she told
[2:37] her that she and her brother go to
[2:39] church every Sunday. She said, 'I told
[2:41] him, her little brother in the car when
[2:43] we were there that we should pray to God
[2:45] to save us. So, we prayed together and
[2:47] he did.

[2:51] faith as a little child. Amen. And I

[20:44] Jesus
[20:48] Jesus.
[20:50] [Music]
[21:07] I know not why God's wonderous grace to
[21:14] me he had made known
[21:20] nor why unworthy
[21:24] Christ in love redeemed
[21:28] me for his own.
[21:32] I know not how his saving faith to me he
[21:40] did impart,
[21:44] nor how believing
[21:48] in his word peace within my heart.
[21:56] But I know whom I have believed
[22:01] and I'm persuaded
[22:04] that he is aable
[22:07] to give those which have committed
[22:13] unto him against that day.
[22:19] I know not how the spirit moves. Convene
[22:27] sin men of sin
[22:31] revealing
[22:33] Jesus
[22:34] through the world cateing
[22:38] faith in him.
[22:42] I know not what of good or evil may be

[22:57] golden days before
[23:01] his face I see.
[23:05] But I know whom I have believed
[23:10] and I'm persuaded
[23:13] that he is able
[23:16] to keep that which have committed
[23:22] unto him against the day.
[23:28] I know not when the Lord may come at
[23:34] night or noon day fair,
[23:38] nor if I walk the veil with him or meet
[23:46] him in the air.
[23:50] But I know whom I have believed
[23:55] and I'm persuaded
[23:58] that he is able
[24:01] to give those which have committed
[24:06] unto him against the day.
[24:12] But I know whom I have believed
[24:17] and I'm persuaded
[24:20] that he is able
[24:23] to keep those which have committed
[24:30] unto him
[24:32] against that day.
[24:38] Amen.
[24:40] [Applause]

[24:59] uh we're thankful for the blessing that
[25:01] God's given brother Jason and Sister
[25:04] Remy. So, they're going to come at this
[25:06] time. And as they come, let's sing. I am
[25:08] so glad that our father in heaven tells
[25:10] of his love in the book he has given.
[25:17] I am so glad that our father in heaven
[25:22] tells of his love in the book he has
[25:25] given to wonderful things in the Bible.
[25:30] I see this is the dear that Jesus loves
[25:35] me. Oh, I am so glad that Jesus loves
[25:40] me. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. I am
[25:46] so glad that Jesus loves me. Jesus loves
[25:52] me.
[25:54] [Music]
[25:55] In thissurance I find sweetest rest.
[26:00] Trusting Jesus I know I am blessed.
[26:05] Satan dismayed from my soul. Now I flee
[26:09] where
[26:11] that Jesus loves me. I am so glad that
[26:16] Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. Jesus
[26:22] loves me. I am so glad that Jesus loves
[26:27] me. Jesus loves me.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:34] Amen.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Well, it's wonderful to be able to start
[26:37] Mother's Day out by introducing another
[26:41] mother.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; You have just entered a very special
[26:47] place. Sister Emmy, this is uh you're
[26:50] beginning now
[26:53] the gospel according to mother.
[26:56] Brother Bram talked about this gospel.
[27:00] Brother Jason, Sister Emmy are here to
[27:04] dedicate their son,
[27:07] Shawn Edward Lock Ashdone.
[27:12] Sure, there weren't another one or two
[27:14] you could add in there.
[27:18] Shawn, which actually is John, Jehovah
[27:21] has graced.
[27:23] Ed we know is witness
[27:26] and lock is stronghold.
[27:29] And I found some interesting things
[27:31] about that name. May not have come from
[27:34] where you think it came, but
[27:36] nevertheless,
[27:38] I thought of the scripture which I'm
[27:41] just going to read and then I'm going to
[27:42] read a number of scriptures.
[27:45] Hannah said, "For this child I prayed."
[27:49] And I thought it was very fitting
[27:51] for Jason and Emmy. for this child. I
[27:55] prayed and the Lord hath given me my
[27:58] petition which I asked of him and I
[28:01] believe there are this church prayed
[28:04] that our brother Jason, sister Emmy
[28:06] would be able to have this child and uh
[28:09] the grandparents
[28:11] undoubtedly prayed and we have brother
[28:14] Gil and sister Karen and Emy's mother
[28:17] here uh to be with us at this time and
[28:22] that's very very special. were happy
[28:24] they were able to be here.
[28:28] Hannah, however, didn't only pray for
[28:30] this child. So, I'm just going to take a
[28:32] few moments. Hannah prayed a prayer of
[28:36] thanksgiving
[28:38] after she had the child. And I can tell
[28:41] you this woman was a very spiritual
[28:43] woman because she she makes really no
[28:46] reference to how much she had prayed for
[28:49] the child and that God was so gracious
[28:51] to give. But this is her prayer and I
[28:54] want to read it.
[28:56] And Hannah prayed and said, "My heart
[28:59] rejoicth in the Lord. Mine horn is
[29:03] exalted in the Lord. My mouth is
[29:05] enlarged over mine enemies because I
[29:09] rejoice in thy salvation." She was
[29:12] different from the others. "There is
[29:14] none holy, is the Lord, for there is
[29:17] none beside thee. Neither is there any
[29:19] rock like our God. Talk no more so
[29:23] exceeding proudly, excuse me. Let not
[29:27] arrogancy come out of your mouth, for
[29:29] the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by
[29:33] him actions are weighed. The bows of the
[29:37] mighty men are broken, and they that
[29:41] stumbled are girded with strength. They
[29:43] that were full have hired out themselves
[29:46] for bread, and they that were hungry
[29:49] ceased. So that the barren hath borne
[29:52] seven, and they and she that hath many
[29:56] children is waxed feeble. The Lord
[29:59] kleth, and the maketh alive. He bringeth
[30:02] down to the grave, and bringeth up. The
[30:05] Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich. He
[30:09] bringeth low, and lifteth up. He raisth
[30:12] up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth
[30:14] up the beggar from the dung hill. So set
[30:17] them among princes, and make them
[30:20] inherit the throne of glory. For the
[30:23] pillars of the earth are the lords, and
[30:25] he hath set the world upon them. He will
[30:28] keep the feet of his saints, and the
[30:31] wicked shall be silent in darkness. For
[30:34] by strength shall no man prevail. The
[30:37] adversaries of the Lord shall be broken
[30:39] to pieces. out of heaven shall he
[30:42] thunder upon them, and the Lord shall
[30:44] judge the ends of the earth, and he
[30:47] shall give strength unto his king, and
[30:50] exalt the horn of his anointed. Now,
[30:53] that gives a little insight into the
[30:56] woman that God heard and gave a child
[31:01] and she said, "For this child, I
[31:03] prayed." And now, she didn't go on in
[31:06] some emotional realm. She went on to
[31:09] glorify God. And I would say that may
[31:12] this child that God has given to our
[31:15] brother Jason and sister Emmy, may he be
[31:19] a child that will be brought up at the
[31:23] hands of a mother that knows God. Emmy,
[31:26] you have made some difficult decisions
[31:28] in your life and you stand here. Brother
[31:30] Jason, I believe, is the first son that
[31:32] was born in Cloverdale Bible Way. not
[31:35] the first son that was here, but the
[31:37] first son that was actually born in the
[31:39] church. And now it's amazing to see that
[31:42] he has come this distance and has given
[31:45] his life to the Lord. And now God has
[31:48] given him a son. And I pray that they
[31:50] shall raise him to the glory of God.
[31:53] Amen. We're going to dedicate.
[32:00] Amen.
[32:03] how gracious you are, Lord.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; You've heard the many prayers that have
[32:07] been prayed.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; And you've seen the hearts the hearts of
[32:11] this this couple that is here, our
[32:13] brother Jason, Sister Emmy. You've
[32:16] watched over their lives. You have
[32:18] watched over their footsteps. And Lord,
[32:21] I believe it is their deepest desire not
[32:23] only to serve you and give you
[32:26] theirelves unreservedly,
[32:29] but now they are holding this son which
[32:32] they have now uh been given a gift of
[32:36] God. And Lord, as I as I hold this son
[32:39] in my arms, I hold them Lord Jesus as
[32:42] you would hold him. And Lord, as you
[32:45] have given him, now they give him back
[32:48] to you. We dedicate Lord Sean Edward
[32:51] Lockach in the name of the Lord Jesus
[32:54] Christ to the service of Christ. Oh God,
[32:57] as Hannah brought Samuel and gave him
[33:01] and returned him to you, Lord Jesus,
[33:04] this couple now brings him and I pray
[33:07] that you will take Shawn, Lord. I pray
[33:10] you'll take this son and use him to your
[33:13] glory. And if time should go on, may he
[33:16] raise up and be like his father, a
[33:18] blessing to the assembly. May he be like
[33:21] his mother, a stable, steady uh one
[33:24] who's got her eyes upon the goal, fixed
[33:27] upon the goal. And Lord, I pray you'll
[33:30] bless brother Jason, sister Emmy as they
[33:32] instruct him. And I ask oh God that your
[33:35] blessing will be upon their family Lord
[33:38] that you give them good health and that
[33:41] you will prosper them Lord in spirit
[33:44] spiritually and materially in every way
[33:46] according to your will in the name of
[33:49] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:53] That's one fine boy.
[33:57] May there be many more.
[34:00] God bless his
[34:03] brother Rod.
[34:08] It's a quartet. Uh brother Mike Gier and
[34:11] some others who are going to come and
[34:12] sing this morning. And as they come,
[34:14] let's sing together. I bless your name.
[34:16] I bless your name.
[34:19] I bless your name.
[34:24] I bless your name.
[34:28] I give you honor,
[34:32] Lord. I give you praise.
[34:35] [Applause]
[34:37] You are the life,
[34:41] the truth, the way.
[34:45] I bless your name.
[34:50] I bless your name.
[34:54] I bless your name.
[34:58] Lord, I bless your name.
[35:02] I give you honor. I give you honor.
[35:07] I give you praise.
[35:10] You are the
[35:15] truth, the way.
[35:19] I bless your name.
[35:23] I bless your name.
[35:26] [Music]
[35:42] [Music]
[35:45] Amidst
[35:47] [Music]
[35:57] the hustling, clamoring world, sometimes
[36:01] it's hard to hear
[36:04] the voice of God speaking to my soul.
[36:11] But in my quiet time alone, when I
[36:15] approach his holy throne, his tender
[36:18] words fall gently on my ears.
[36:23] He still speaks.
[36:29] I know his voice.
[36:36] Sweeter
[36:38] sound.
[36:40] Never ever heard my mortal
[36:44] ear.
[36:49] And to think that God by his own choice
[36:56] would speak to me, it makes me rejoice.
[37:02] He still speaks.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; I know his voice.
[37:10] [Music]
[37:14] There are so many who still doubt that
[37:17] God can speak today.
[37:20] They laugh and mock when we say we've
[37:22] heard from God.
[37:26] Yet the still small voice of God is
[37:28] heard above the doubts of this world.
[37:32] It's time his words ring out with hope
[37:35] today.
[37:37] He still speaks.
[37:43] I know his voice.
[37:49] Sweeter
[37:51] sound
[37:52] never heard by mortal ears.
[38:01] And to think that God by his own choice
[38:08] would speak to me, it makes me rejoice.
[38:13] He still speaks.
[38:16] [Music]
[38:17] I know his voice.
[38:24] He still speaks.
[38:29] I know his voice.
[38:35] Sweeter sound
[38:38] never heard by mortal ear.
[38:47] And to think that God by his own choice
[38:53] would speak to me, it makes me rejoice.
[38:59] He still speaks.
[39:01] [Music]
[39:03] &gt;&gt; I know his voice.
[39:11] He still speaks.
[39:17] He still speaks.
[39:23] I know his voice.
[39:30] [Laughter]
[39:32] [Music]
[39:34] I know his voice.
[39:39] [Music]
[39:42] [Applause]
[39:48] Praise the Lord.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; That's wonderful.
[39:53] I was I was singing that the other day
[39:56] in the car and I mentioned it and here
[39:58] the brothers got all ready to sing it
[40:00] this morning.
[40:03] Amen.
[40:06] Well,
[40:08] this is Mother's Day.
[40:11] the world is remembering it and they've
[40:13] commercialized about everything that can
[40:15] be commercialized.
[40:17] But nevertheless, we're not going to
[40:19] lose sight of how precious mothers are
[40:22] to us. And we are thankful for each of
[40:25] you mothers that are here today,
[40:29] godly mothers that have heard the voice
[40:32] of God, have responded,
[40:36] and the children have an example. how
[40:39] wonderful it is. Uh and there are many
[40:43] others who are not mothers but that
[40:47] still does not take away from the fact
[40:50] that you have a part in that you are an
[40:53] example.
[40:54] Uh, I said a few words to the school
[40:58] teachers the other day
[41:01] and it it came to me that they spend so
[41:05] many hours with the children of the
[41:08] families that are here in the
[41:10] congregation
[41:12] and that while they
[41:15] have all of this time with the parents
[41:18] uh the parents have committed the
[41:19] children and they have all of this time
[41:21] with the children of these parents. I
[41:24] thought of the phrase which I just used
[41:26] in the dedication, the gospel. Brother
[41:30] Brandham said there are five gospels,
[41:33] Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and mother.
[41:36] And I don't think he said that just to
[41:39] uh give uh some poetic license to the
[41:43] phrase, but the mother is indeed a
[41:46] gospel to the children. And uh but in
[41:51] the gospels as we read Matthew, Mark,
[41:53] Luke, and John, we find that there are
[41:56] many others that are included in those
[42:00] gospels that make up part of that
[42:03] gospel. And I I felt to say to the to
[42:06] the teachers, you are part of the gospel
[42:10] according to mother because you are
[42:13] playing a very very integral part in the
[42:16] lives of these children. But I want to
[42:18] say to the whole congregation today, it
[42:21] doesn't take just the mother, but there
[42:24] are others in the congregation that you
[42:28] interact with these children. And we we
[42:31] also have a responsibility of having
[42:34] example to them. And I can think of my
[42:37] childhood and think of those who I uh
[42:41] interacted with and looked up to. They
[42:43] weren't my mother, but they certainly
[42:45] had an effect upon my life. And I'm glad
[42:48] for their lives. I'm glad for every
[42:50] mother. I'm glad for the mothers that
[42:52] are not here that have gone on to their
[42:55] reward. And they have laid the laid
[42:59] their their life down. They have their
[43:02] record is already been finished and
[43:04] they've gone on to their reward. And
[43:07] we're thankful for those. And my mother
[43:09] joins uh that crowd. She's part of that
[43:13] host of witnesses. And so each one of us
[43:15] I think of what brother Brandham said
[43:17] about about his mother after
[43:22] uh the time she had just passed away and
[43:25] he said how many times
[43:28] uh I'm sorry he was talking to her at
[43:30] her bedside just before she passed away.
[43:33] And I I happened to be listening to the
[43:35] messages last week. I listened to a
[43:38] spirit of truth and brother Brandham
[43:40] talked so much about his mother in that
[43:43] in that uh message. She had already
[43:45] passed away but he said that how many
[43:49] times you walked away from the table so
[43:52] I could have something to eat. And she
[43:55] said it was just a duty.
[43:59] She felt that was just something she
[44:00] needed to do. walk away from the table
[44:03] when there wasn't enough for for all the
[44:06] children to eat. And uh we read of
[44:10] prayers of a mother.
[44:13] Uh my wife and I were speaking on the
[44:15] way here to church about the love of a
[44:17] mother.
[44:20] And brother Brandham related the
[44:22] instance of the uh colored woman, the
[44:26] mother in Memphis when the plane landed
[44:30] and because of a snowstorm and could not
[44:33] take off until the next morning. And uh
[44:37] he related, I I thought today that I
[44:39] should perhaps list down all the
[44:43] conversations that he had with me
[44:46] because it would be a blessing, no
[44:47] doubt. And I don't think it was done by
[44:49] accident. And when he related this
[44:52] account, he looked at me and said,
[44:54] "Brother Eddie, what brought that plane
[44:58] down?
[45:00] What brought that plane down in that
[45:02] snowstorm?"
[45:04] And I didn't have an answer. And he
[45:07] said, "The love of a mother,
[45:10] the love of a mother brought the plane
[45:13] down. The love of a mother caused a
[45:16] snowstorm that brought Elijah to her
[45:19] door. I tell you what, friends, you you
[45:23] you we possess things that we don't
[45:25] realize we possess. Do you believe that?
[45:29] &gt;&gt; The love of a mother and then the gospel
[45:31] according to mothers. So, we're thankful
[45:34] for our mothers. And uh it's a shame
[45:36] that we are just spending so few minutes
[45:40] speaking about them.
[45:43] We could spend a long time speaking
[45:46] about our mothers and those mothers that
[45:49] we have today that are here present and
[45:51] those that are not with us but they are
[45:54] connected to us today in the internet.
[45:57] We're we're so thankful for each one of
[46:00] you and I say may God's blessings be
[46:03] upon you. Amen.
[46:06] I'll have you stand. We're going to
[46:08] read.
[46:14] We're thankful also
[46:16] to have our sister Norma with us. I
[46:19] believe I looked back and saw our sister
[46:21] Norma, a real soldier. God bless her, a
[46:25] real mother. Others that are have made a
[46:28] a special effort to be here today. Uh
[46:32] God bless you. And my uh my sister is
[46:38] here as well. Many of you don't know.
[46:41] She was taken to the hospital a few just
[46:44] a few days ago. And uh so we're
[46:48] believing for all of these. Our brother
[46:50] Mike Vineyard, God bless you. We have
[46:53] needs here friends. We have needs. But
[46:57] we have come to the fountain. Amen. Just
[47:02] before we uh read the word, let's pray.
[47:06] Our gracious father,
[47:10] how we depend upon your supply and your
[47:13] provision.
[47:15] Lord, as we come to speak before the
[47:18] purchase of your blood, the people that
[47:21] you have sent to journey together and
[47:26] sojourn together, I pray that you will
[47:29] cause this to be a special meeting time.
[47:33] And it can only be special if the Holy
[47:35] Spirit will feel at liberty to take
[47:39] control of the minds and the hearts of
[47:42] the people. I have already asked you, oh
[47:46] God, to take control of my mouth that I
[47:49] may say only those things that would be
[47:51] pleasing to you to instruct the uh the
[47:55] people along their journey to give
[47:58] revelation to those that perhaps have
[48:01] not received that Lord for your word can
[48:04] only be understood by divine revelation.
[48:07] And I pray that that will be our
[48:08] portion. Oh God, move back the clouds.
[48:12] Move back the doubt, oh God. Move back
[48:15] skepticism, oh God. Move back every
[48:18] hindrance. And let your people that you
[48:21] have purchased and have ordained to life
[48:23] and ordained to the revelation of your
[48:25] word and which is the revelation of
[48:27] yourself. Oh, we want to see you, Lord
[48:30] Jesus, in all of your beauty. I pray
[48:32] you'll captivate us now by the Holy
[48:35] Spirit and energize us. And may the
[48:38] angels of God that surround this place
[48:41] and stand at their post of duty it
[48:43] beside each person. I pray oh God that
[48:46] the we will feel the influence of it as
[48:49] your prophet messenger has said we will
[48:51] feel their influence. And Lord I pray
[48:54] that you will be lifted up and glorified
[48:56] in this service in Jesus Christ's name.
[48:59] Amen. Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; I want to read from John the first
[49:02] chapter just a few verses starting with
[49:06] verse one. John 1 and 1.
[49:16] Everyone feeling good?
[49:19] &gt;&gt; That's good. Beautiful day. Sun's
[49:22] shining outside. Let's have him shine
[49:24] inside also.
[49:26] In the beginning was the word and the
[49:29] word was with God and the word was God.
[49:34] The same was in the beginning with God
[49:37] and all things were made by him and
[49:40] without him was not anything made that
[49:42] was made. In him was life and the life
[49:47] was the light of man. We'll cease to
[49:50] read there and you may have your seats.
[50:00] I would like to get your thoughts
[50:02] immediately
[50:04] uh
[50:07] in line with what I want to bring to you
[50:09] this morning as as quickly as possible.
[50:13] Each one of us that are here today, we
[50:15] are we have human life coursing through
[50:19] our bodies.
[50:22] we have
[50:24] uh a pulsating of natural life, human
[50:29] life.
[50:30] But then there are also those of us and
[50:34] I trust by God's grace I can say each of
[50:37] us that are gathered here have another
[50:40] life pulsating in us and it is God's
[50:43] life
[50:45] called Zoey life.
[50:48] Uh I would like if you would watch and
[50:51] see some uh slides which I have prepared
[50:55] and these slides are just to give us a a
[50:58] basis for the comments. I will be kind
[51:02] of referring to them as we move on. So
[51:06] we will I'm just going to move through
[51:08] them.
[51:12] God's life. Zoe life
[51:21] I don't.
[51:27] All right. Life in the absolute sense.
[51:33] Life as God has it.
[51:38] And that which the father has in
[51:40] himself. This is Zoey life. Life in the
[51:44] absolute sense. Life as God has it. And
[51:47] that which the father has in himself.
[51:51] God's life.
[51:53] Zoey life. In the token message, we have
[51:57] this quote. Eternal life comes from the
[52:01] word Zoey, which means God's own life.
[52:06] Further in that token quote, "The only
[52:09] way that you ever can have life, there's
[52:12] only one form of eternal life, and
[52:15] that's God's own life in you. Then you
[52:18] have eternal life because he is the only
[52:22] eternal there is." And we are the
[52:25] attributes of his thoughts before there
[52:29] was even a foundation of the world or
[52:32] anything. All this is just his thinking
[52:37] and we're the display of his thoughts of
[52:41] what it was, what his thoughts were.
[52:44] We're the display of his thoughts.
[52:47] And now Zoe life is life that the father
[52:51] gave to his son Jesus Christ to have in
[52:54] himself.
[52:56] John 5:26. For as the father hath life
[52:59] in himself, so hath he given to the son
[53:02] to have life in himself.
[53:06] This is the Zoey life. Life which the
[53:08] son manifested to the world. John 1 John
[53:12] 1 and2. For the life was manifested and
[53:16] we have seen it and bear witness and
[53:19] show unto you that eternal life which
[53:22] was with the father and was manifested
[53:26] unto us. wasn't just with the father but
[53:28] was manifested unto us.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; And from this life, man has been become
[53:33] alienated as a result of the fall.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:18,
[53:40] having the understanding darkened, being
[53:43] alienated from the life of God through
[53:46] the ignorance that is in them because of
[53:49] the blindness of their heart.
[53:53] Through this life, man, men men become
[53:56] partakers
[53:58] through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[54:02] For John 3:15,
[54:05] that whosoever believeth in him should
[54:08] not perish, but have eternal life.
[54:11] That's the life we're speaking of. Now,
[54:15] Christ in truth is our life.
[54:20] Colossians 3:4, "When Christ who is our
[54:24] life shall appear, then shall ye also
[54:28] appear with him in glory."
[54:33] Jesus Christ now maintains that life.
[54:38] John 6 and35. And Jesus said unto them,
[54:41] I am the bread of life. That's the
[54:45] maintains the life. He that cometh to me
[54:47] shall never hunger, and he that
[54:49] believeth on me shall never thirst. Also
[54:52] another scripture in this regard, John 6
[54:54] and uh 63, it is the spirit that
[54:58] quickenth, the flesh profiteth nothing.
[55:00] The words that I speak unto you, they
[55:02] are spirit and they are life. I love
[55:06] that scripture. They are spirit and they
[55:09] are life. The words that I speak. So the
[55:13] word becomes ultimately supreme.
[55:16] If you don't have the word, you don't
[55:18] have the bread of life. You don't have
[55:20] the word, you don't have life. If you
[55:22] don't have the word, you don't have
[55:23] Christ. And that is why Satan has such a
[55:26] uh such a turmoil and confusion going on
[55:30] over the word.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; What is truth and what is the word?
[55:34] Everybody can't have it because it's all
[55:36] different.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; And that is why our confidence is so
[55:39] strong in thus sayeth the Lord. Amen.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; We're only interested in thus sayeth the
[55:44] Lord and what God vindicates and what he
[55:46] confirms.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; This eternal life is the present actual
[55:52] possession of the believer.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; John 5 and 24. Verily, verily, I say
[55:57] unto you, he that heareth my word and
[56:00] believeth on him that sent me hath
[56:03] everlasting life, and shall not come
[56:05] into condemnation, but is passed from
[56:08] death unto life. Amen. in modern events
[56:12] made clear by the prophecy. For you're a
[56:14] gene of your father, and you were in
[56:17] your father, yet your father had no
[56:20] fellowship with you. You were in there,
[56:23] but you knew it not, and he knew it not.
[56:26] But you were manifested that that that
[56:29] he might fellowship with you.
[56:33] And you being born again, you're born of
[56:37] eternal life. And that's the only one
[56:40] form of eternal life and that's God's
[56:42] life. Zoey, the Greek word is Zoey. Only
[56:46] one form of eternal life.
[56:50] Then if you are a son of God or a
[56:52] daughter of God, you were in God all the
[56:55] time, but he knew what bed and time
[56:59] you'd be planted. So now you're made a
[57:03] creature, a son of God, manifested son
[57:06] or daughter of God to meet the challenge
[57:09] of this hour. I can just stop there and
[57:12] say you'll never meet the challenge of
[57:14] this hour in just normal human life.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; You'll never meet the challenge of this
[57:20] hour with just human life being inspired
[57:24] by some other religious life or
[57:27] religious thought. uh you'll never meet
[57:30] the challenge of this hour merely by
[57:32] being stimulated
[57:34] &gt;&gt; by being stimulated by whatever it might
[57:38] be that stimulates a person. You'll
[57:40] never meet the challenge of this hour.
[57:42] But you'll meet the challenge of this
[57:44] hour to vindicate the true and living
[57:47] God of this hour. The message that is
[57:51] coming forth in this time.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; It's the only way to meet the challenge
[57:55] of the hour.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:58] Amen.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Then if you're a son or daughter of God,
[58:05] you were in God.
[58:08] You were in God all the time.
[58:11] He said, and he knew what bed. He knew
[58:15] where you'd be conceived. He knew where
[58:18] you'd be planted, where you'd live. And
[58:20] he ordained that you'd be here at this
[58:23] time. You're here, friends, not merely
[58:26] to, you know, fill a space in uh in the
[58:30] world, but you're here to meet the
[58:32] challenge of the hour.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that?
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says, "And the Lord God
[58:38] formed man of the dust of the ground and
[58:42] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[58:44] life, and man became a living soul." Now
[58:49] the scripture tells us also in uh
[58:52] Genesis 1 and 26 that God said let us
[58:57] make man in our image.
[59:00] He formed man then secondly out of the
[59:03] dust of the earth. Now this life that
[59:06] said and the Lord God formed man out of
[59:09] the dust of the ground and breathed into
[59:11] his nostrils a breath of life. But that
[59:13] was that's Genesis 2 and uh and 7. But
[59:17] Genesis 1 and 26 said, "And so God
[59:21] created man in his own image." Now
[59:24] Genesis 2 and7 does not say that that
[59:28] was his own image.
[59:30] He said in 1 and 26, so God created man
[59:34] in his own image, in the image of God
[59:37] created he him. Male and female created
[59:39] he them.
[59:41] And then he says in 2 and 7, "And the
[59:45] Lord God formed man of the dust of the
[59:48] ground and breathed into his nostrils
[59:51] the breath of life. And man became a
[59:54] living soul.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; He breathed that breath of life,
[1:00:01] the first man into the second man,
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; if you want to put it that way. And man
[1:00:06] became a living soul." Now in questions
[1:00:10] and answers, brother Brandon was asked a
[1:00:11] question
[1:00:14] uh
[1:00:17] he and and he and he reads a scripture.
[1:00:19] He formed them out of the dust of the
[1:00:21] earth and breathed into his nostrils.
[1:00:24] And the question is what is the
[1:00:26] difference or where is the connection in
[1:00:30] the above scripture?
[1:00:32] What connection does the first man have
[1:00:34] with the second man?
[1:00:37] And uh he goes on he says the first man
[1:00:41] is the second man made manifest in five
[1:00:44] senses.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; The first man is the second man made
[1:00:50] manifest in five senses. The first man
[1:00:53] was made in the image of God and God is
[1:00:55] a spirit.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; So the first man is a spirit man.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. the first man and and by sexual
[1:01:03] birth we have missed actually haven't
[1:01:07] missed that first man but we missed
[1:01:08] being that first man that first man is
[1:01:12] the second man made manifest in five
[1:01:15] senses and then he goes on to say he
[1:01:18] said all right that's the connection God
[1:01:21] is determined when God makes up his mind
[1:01:24] to do anything it has to be Satan
[1:01:29] spoiled spoiled the picture by sexual
[1:01:32] desire by the woman to bring forth
[1:01:35] children. He spoiled it. So go ahead and
[1:01:37] make it. That's all right. He said this
[1:01:39] habitation to pick up these cuz the only
[1:01:42] thing that you can do in this life is to
[1:01:46] pick up your form and image of what you
[1:01:49] are. The only thing you can do in this
[1:01:52] life is you pick up your form and the
[1:01:55] image in this life. Amen.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; If you're redheaded now, you'll be
[1:02:02] redheaded. If you're blackheaded now,
[1:02:04] you'll be blackheaded then. What you
[1:02:06] what you wear at your best. Satan
[1:02:09] interrupted the picture and you didn't
[1:02:11] get you didn't even get what God
[1:02:14] intended you to be that you'll be. And
[1:02:17] he said, "Oh, how glorious."
[1:02:20] And there's your man. Now, I'd like to
[1:02:23] make a few statements here because I'm
[1:02:25] just going to go slowly for a wee bit.
[1:02:28] death and life cannot exist at the same
[1:02:31] time. The kind of life that I'm talking
[1:02:33] about in questions and answers also he
[1:02:36] said death is not uh associated with
[1:02:39] life. Life and death cannot exist at the
[1:02:43] same time in the realms of the human
[1:02:46] being. Death is associated with sin
[1:02:51] because before we had any sin we had no
[1:02:54] death at all. Before we had sin, we had
[1:02:58] no death at all. But where there is
[1:03:01] death, then there is sin. And where
[1:03:05] there is sin, there is death. They are
[1:03:08] associated together. Because death is
[1:03:11] the results of sin. The soul that
[1:03:14] sinnth, it shall die. But when you're
[1:03:18] born again of the spirit of God, we have
[1:03:21] eternal life and not associated anywhere
[1:03:25] with death.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; When we have eternal life, because it's
[1:03:30] a different type of life, we're talking
[1:03:32] about human life, human existence, which
[1:03:37] through that human existence, man fell.
[1:03:40] And because of man's fall, then came
[1:03:43] judgment and came the separation from
[1:03:45] God. And death is associated with that
[1:03:48] life. But when a man or woman is born
[1:03:51] again, there is no death associated with
[1:03:54] that life.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; That is Zoey life, God's life.
[1:04:00] But when you're born again the spirit of
[1:04:02] God by the sp of the spirit of God we
[1:04:05] have eternal life and not associated
[1:04:08] anywhere with death. Death cannot
[1:04:12] associate with life. And I want to say
[1:04:14] amen to that.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Life cannot associate with death.
[1:04:23] Now God commissioned Adam
[1:04:27] and Eve to multiply and replenish the
[1:04:29] earth.
[1:04:33] That commandment,
[1:04:36] that commandment cannot
[1:04:41] bring forth death.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; That commandment cannot bring forth
[1:04:49] death. How can God almighty God say
[1:04:53] multiply and replenish the earth and
[1:04:55] associated with those words is death is
[1:04:59] sickness is pain is suffering is trouble
[1:05:04] is starvation is all of these things how
[1:05:07] can those things be associated with the
[1:05:09] god the author of life
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; so you see it was a different life that
[1:05:14] brought the world what we have today
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; it was not that commandment oment.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; That's very important.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; We're going to get in some deep swimming
[1:05:26] water. So, just for a few moments,
[1:05:31] the commandment cannot bring forth
[1:05:33] death. In the spoken words, the original
[1:05:36] seed, I'm going to do considerable
[1:05:37] reading, so I hope you don't mind. He
[1:05:40] said, "Now notice what happened to Eve's
[1:05:42] children, the first one that was born.
[1:05:46] Now, if God said multiply to his bride,
[1:05:50] to Adam's bride, multiply and replenish
[1:05:54] the earth, that was God's commission.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; And she would have done it. She would
[1:06:00] have br she would have uh she would have
[1:06:04] done it and he would mixing themselves
[1:06:07] together.
[1:06:08] But what happened when Adam got ready to
[1:06:11] come to her? She was already a mother
[1:06:15] and said, "See what I mean?" He said,
[1:06:16] "Now the same thing has happened to
[1:06:19] Christ's church, Christ's bride. Her
[1:06:22] first child came forth. It was a bastard
[1:06:25] child and he was full of death and
[1:06:27] caused death.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Cain was full of death and caused death.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; You just listen real close. And everyone
[1:06:38] since then is death.
[1:06:41] There's one thing that all humanity has
[1:06:44] in common. No man has escaped death.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Enoch was translated.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; We do not know of any other that
[1:06:56] actually escaped death. We all are
[1:07:00] summoned to death. So he says when God
[1:07:04] give a commission when God give a
[1:07:07] commission which cannot perish God's
[1:07:11] words eternal it cannot fail when he
[1:07:15] said now I'm giving the quote see when
[1:07:17] he said multiply and replenish the earth
[1:07:21] that was God's eternal purpose
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; to carry it out you cannot die
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; you know this becomes this this becomes
[1:07:31] You you've got to really just absorb
[1:07:34] this because we got a foundation truth
[1:07:37] here. When God said replenish, multiply,
[1:07:40] and replenish the earth, that was God's
[1:07:44] eternal purpose. And to carry it out,
[1:07:47] you cannot die. So, Adam and Eve were
[1:07:50] not carrying it out
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; when death was brought into the earth.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; That's just that simple.
[1:08:02] because it's his word. You have to live.
[1:08:06] And if the child would have been brought
[1:08:09] forth right, they'd have been there
[1:08:11] would have been no death because she
[1:08:15] because she wouldn't wait. He went on
[1:08:18] the word of God, the word that God spoke
[1:08:21] to multiply and replenish the earth. He
[1:08:24] said it couldn't find a place to land.
[1:08:28] But finally this word, this word, this
[1:08:33] word replenish and and multiply and
[1:08:36] replenish. He said this word finally
[1:08:41] caught into the womb of a virgin.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; It was that commandment that caught that
[1:08:48] commandment didn't catch into the womb
[1:08:50] of ma of Eve. That commandment caught
[1:08:54] into the womb of Mary
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; and the virgin and what happened from
[1:09:00] him?
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Came forth the germ of life.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; The thing that gives the water and that
[1:09:09] gives the kernel its chance to reproduce
[1:09:12] itself. The spirit came out of him
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; and went up.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that spirit has come
[1:09:20] back down into the church. Oh, the
[1:09:23] depths of this word, friends, the depths
[1:09:25] of this message, that commandment, that
[1:09:28] commission to multiply and replenish the
[1:09:32] earth caught into the womb of a virgin
[1:09:35] Mary who could say, "Be it unto me
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; according to thy word."
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; And she brought forth
[1:09:45] the germ of life, none other than Jesus
[1:09:48] Christ. How thankful we are today.
[1:09:54] The first commission
[1:09:56] of God to Adam was be fruitful and
[1:10:00] multiply and replenish the earth.
[1:10:04] And God blessed them. I'm reading these
[1:10:06] now. I hope it's not too chopped up for
[1:10:08] you. And God blessed them. And God said
[1:10:12] unto them, "Be fruitful and multiply." I
[1:10:16] just want the congregation to be
[1:10:18] settled. I just want you to be quiet and
[1:10:21] be real uh attentive. This is God's
[1:10:25] first words,
[1:10:28] first commission to Adam when he's been
[1:10:31] made in his image. For it's Genesis 1
[1:10:34] and 28.
[1:10:37] Eve has not yet been separated from him.
[1:10:43] And God is saying, "And God blessed them
[1:10:46] plural. And God said unto them, plural,
[1:10:50] read your Bible and it'll show you.
[1:10:52] Genesis 1:25 says, "Let us make man in
[1:10:56] our image." Genesis 1:26, "And God made
[1:10:59] man in his image. And when he was done,
[1:11:01] he had one person on the earth, Adam."
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; And Adam was essentially came out from
[1:11:08] God, a a a product of God. And and and
[1:11:12] God who is one had a man who was in his
[1:11:16] image on the earth.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; And God has all attributes within
[1:11:20] himself. He has all masculine
[1:11:22] attributes, all feminine attributes
[1:11:24] within himself. And now Adam has those
[1:11:27] attributes. And then God according to
[1:11:30] his purpose and plan in in Genesis 2
[1:11:33] separates those attributes. But before
[1:11:35] he does, and he took the feminist part
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; of those and put it in a in a in one
[1:11:42] called Eve.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; It's exactly what your Bible says.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, be fruitful and
[1:11:50] multiply and replenish the earth and
[1:11:52] subdue it and have dominion over the
[1:11:54] fish of the sea, etc., etc. Now,
[1:11:58] Satan,
[1:12:00] we could say Lucifer,
[1:12:03] this
[1:12:04] this master of cunning,
[1:12:08] this master of deception
[1:12:11] and deceit,
[1:12:13] this one that was created without
[1:12:18] any reproductive
[1:12:20] glands
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; because angels do not reproduce.
[1:12:28] We say we get into little swimming
[1:12:30] water.
[1:12:32] You'll find no place in the scripture,
[1:12:36] no place where angels are male and
[1:12:39] female.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; No place whatsoever.
[1:12:44] In fact is they do not have reproductive
[1:12:47] organs.
[1:12:49] And Satan in heaven desired to have a
[1:12:54] position higher than he was in. And so
[1:12:58] it does not come as a surprise to me
[1:13:00] that Satan came down now and he's found
[1:13:04] in the garden. He does not have
[1:13:07] reproductive organs. He does not have
[1:13:10] that capacity. So, he comes to a
[1:13:13] creature called the serpent that does
[1:13:15] have it.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; And he's an upright being, a being that
[1:13:21] speaks to God. Actually, there's more
[1:13:23] conversation with the serpent between
[1:13:26] the serpent and God than there is
[1:13:27] between Adam and God.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; It's not some creeping animal uh or or
[1:13:34] or slithering creature on the ground.
[1:13:38] This is an intelligent creature. And the
[1:13:41] serpent now is utilizing his body.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; You know something
[1:13:50] now? I I I may be getting out into some
[1:13:53] territory here, but I'll I'll I'll throw
[1:13:55] it out anyway.
[1:13:58] Brother Brandham in his most
[1:14:01] just incredible ministry.
[1:14:05] He ventures into areas that are so
[1:14:10] uh pro that provoke our minds and our
[1:14:14] thoughts and it's good.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; We can find in the scripture
[1:14:23] where Satan uses animals
[1:14:30] You don't find God possessing animals.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; The only instance I know uh and it
[1:14:38] wasn't God possessing the animal but the
[1:14:41] but the mule or the donkey that Balam
[1:14:45] was riding spoke to him.
[1:14:47] Amen.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says when they possessed
[1:14:52] of the gatherines,
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; the demon-possessed man of the
[1:14:56] gatherines, and the demons began to
[1:14:59] speak out
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; and said, "Have you come to torment us
[1:15:03] before our time?" And they asked for
[1:15:05] leave that they might go into the swine.
[1:15:09] And Christ said, "Go." And with that one
[1:15:12] word, those demons went and possessed
[1:15:15] the swine. And their ultimate uh their
[1:15:19] ultimate goal and objective was was
[1:15:22] expressed in the swine. They ran down a
[1:15:24] steam pl steep place and were destroyed
[1:15:26] in the sea. Satan can possess an animal.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; But I don't know of any place where God
[1:15:35] possessed an animal. God possesses
[1:15:39] humans.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; God possesses a believer. Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; But Satan can possess an animal.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; There are no less than three times when
[1:15:51] a person have came before the prophet of
[1:15:54] God. And here were all kinds of of of
[1:15:59] revealing of the needs of the people in
[1:16:02] such an intricate way. In fact, this if
[1:16:05] you wish to listen to this message, the
[1:16:07] spirit of truth, he just told he told a
[1:16:09] number of testimonies. It sounds like
[1:16:11] he's storytelling one after the other.
[1:16:14] And one of them is the one that I was
[1:16:16] in. And he tells all about the checkered
[1:16:19] green shirt that I was wearing, the
[1:16:21] animal. I saw the tape measure come out.
[1:16:24] I saw the horns being measured. We all
[1:16:26] looked at it, heard the voice. It's 42
[1:16:28] in. He tells it all in detail. Brother
[1:16:30] Brandham says God allowed that to
[1:16:33] comfort him because of the loss of his
[1:16:36] mother.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; He's going to lose his mother. And God
[1:16:40] allowed that to comfort him. He said,
[1:16:42] "You you might, you know, you might
[1:16:43] question that God would do something
[1:16:45] like that, but he did that to comfort
[1:16:47] him."
[1:16:48] I was so happy to be able to be on that.
[1:16:51] And that vision was probably 6 hours in
[1:16:54] the unfolding.
[1:16:56] Now, you can just imagine and at the end
[1:16:59] of that, you know that the people in
[1:17:01] Phoenix where he was telling it were
[1:17:04] just in a I think they were in
[1:17:06] wonderment. What is he saying? what's
[1:17:08] the objective of this service? You know,
[1:17:10] this isn't like preaching. And at the
[1:17:12] end, he says, "This the spirit of
[1:17:14] truth." He said, "It was all true. The
[1:17:16] vision was all true. They're always
[1:17:19] true."
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; And then he said, "Now,
[1:17:24] how many have prayer cards?" Bunch of
[1:17:26] people raised their hand. How many
[1:17:27] people don't have prayer cards? He said
[1:17:30] about the same number raised their hand.
[1:17:32] So, he didn't call them up. He just
[1:17:34] started to talk to them right down. this
[1:17:36] woman, this woman here. Began to tell
[1:17:38] her why she's there, etc. And then just
[1:17:41] gave her her name. Went to the next
[1:17:43] person, says, "There's a woman at the
[1:17:45] back. You're at the back." So, you got
[1:17:47] cancer. He says, "You're shadowed.
[1:17:49] You're going to die. You got cancer in
[1:17:51] the breast." And he said, "She's missing
[1:17:53] it." Said, "Mary May."
[1:17:57] Now, Mary May didn't miss that one.
[1:18:02] And it went one after the other after
[1:18:04] the other. about five or six people just
[1:18:06] call them by their name, by their name,
[1:18:07] by their name, by their name. And
[1:18:09] finally, of course, the whole audience,
[1:18:12] you know, is in a in a in a state of
[1:18:15] euphoria
[1:18:17] because that catches that's something
[1:18:19] they can see. That's something they can
[1:18:20] hear with their but but all of that that
[1:18:22] was spoken before that was just as true
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; as calling the woman Mary May
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; or calling the other people by their
[1:18:30] name. It was just as true, but they were
[1:18:32] missing it. They were missing what the
[1:18:34] spirit of truth was trying to say. Oh,
[1:18:37] may we be sensitive.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And catch what God has to say. And
[1:18:42] now I want you to be sensitive. A person
[1:18:44] comes up.
[1:18:47] Good evening, lady.
[1:18:49] A timid spirit.
[1:18:51] He says, "That's that's kind usually the
[1:18:55] kind of a little timid type. You've had
[1:18:58] many sorrows,
[1:19:00] too, haven't you, lady? many sorrows.
[1:19:06] Had a great scare once in your life,
[1:19:09] too.
[1:19:11] Something seemed like when you were a
[1:19:14] school girl. Oh, he said she's had many
[1:19:17] troubles in her life. She's looked down
[1:19:19] through her entire span of her life and
[1:19:22] drops down to one thing. you had a a
[1:19:26] scare when you were just a school girl
[1:19:29] and I believe it was a a dog or
[1:19:32] something along I see something bark and
[1:19:35] go on and you jump and scream you were
[1:19:39] just a little child and that hung all
[1:19:42] through her life and here comes a
[1:19:44] prophet God in such mercy
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; come right down to that one thing that
[1:19:50] troubled her
[1:19:53] and another one and another one. Be not
[1:19:56] afraid. Three right in a row. How do you
[1:19:58] do? Said speak English. You do. You
[1:20:02] believe me to be God's servant? He said
[1:20:04] it's for your little boy. That's right.
[1:20:08] You believe God can tell me what's
[1:20:10] what's his trouble? You believe it? He's
[1:20:12] nervous.
[1:20:14] He's nervous. A mother's brought a boy.
[1:20:16] He's nervous. It's from a scare. A dog
[1:20:20] scared him. That's right. Now, here's
[1:20:23] God got a prophet messenger telling a
[1:20:26] mother what the trouble. They didn't
[1:20:28] know what the trouble was. They couldn't
[1:20:30] pinpoint it.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; I can tell you Satan uses
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; the animal world.
[1:20:40] And here comes
[1:20:48] here comes
[1:20:51] Satan to use a serpent
[1:20:58] in a conflict between God and Satan.
[1:21:01] The Bible never denotes
[1:21:05] sex in angels.
[1:21:07] There's no denoting of sex in angels.
[1:21:11] There's no place in the Bible where
[1:21:13] there's a woman angel because a woman is
[1:21:15] a byproduct of a man. It'd all be the
[1:21:19] same. Like Adam was both Adam and Eve to
[1:21:22] begin with. She was taken from his side.
[1:21:26] So, Satan is a as a fallen archangel
[1:21:30] lusting for the un with unquenchable
[1:21:34] desire to be lifted up as God. There's
[1:21:37] two places in the Bible that says, "I
[1:21:39] will ascend." And Satan said it both
[1:21:42] times.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Only two places in the Bible where
[1:21:46] anyone said, "I will ascend." And Satan
[1:21:50] said them both. What's he want to do?
[1:21:52] It's amazing that he comes now. He comes
[1:21:56] directly
[1:21:57] onto the subject
[1:22:00] of God's first commission multiply and
[1:22:04] replenish and it's something he can't do
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; right
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; he does not have the capacity
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; does he is not a creature of that but he
[1:22:15] comes to use one in the garden that is
[1:22:18] the only one whose seed will mingle
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; an intelligent creature called a serpent
[1:22:25] who beguiled Eve and did indeed sow seed
[1:22:30] in her. And God referred to that seed
[1:22:33] and said, "I'll put enmity between you
[1:22:35] and the woman and between thy seed."
[1:22:38] Listen, friends, if you're hearing a and
[1:22:41] cannot believe that, you'll have to
[1:22:42] swallow God's word in order to have
[1:22:44] life. And God's word said, "I'll put
[1:22:46] enmity between thy seed, serpent seed,
[1:22:51] and the woman's seed." And a woman does
[1:22:54] not have a seed. She has a field. She
[1:22:57] has a bedding ground. And the only woman
[1:23:00] who receives seed outside, the only
[1:23:02] woman of all the billions that have ever
[1:23:04] existed, the only woman who receives
[1:23:06] seed outside of a mental, outside of the
[1:23:10] human instrumentality of a man is one
[1:23:12] woman called Mary.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Mary receives seed. And God was giving a
[1:23:18] promise. He was saying, "I'm going to
[1:23:20] put enmity." enmity clashing between
[1:23:24] your seed,
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; the serpent, and the woman's seed. And
[1:23:30] the woman's seed was Virgin Mary's seed
[1:23:33] that she received from God himself.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; By the spoken word of God,
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus came forth by the spoken word of
[1:23:42] God. He was not Jew. He was not Gentile.
[1:23:47] He was God manifest in the flesh. Amen.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; And uh and and God said, "I'm going to
[1:23:55] put enmity." Who was it that took up
[1:23:58] stones to stone him?
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Who was it that wounded him? Who was it
[1:24:03] that took him to a cross? Serpent seed.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; I'll put enmity between your seed and
[1:24:11] the woman's seed. And Satan now had
[1:24:15] succeeded in his attempt to come into a
[1:24:20] form that could be that reproduction
[1:24:23] could take place. And by that
[1:24:25] reproduction, we die.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; We all came by a natural birth through a
[1:24:31] sexual experience. I don't care who we
[1:24:34] are. And by that birth, we die.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "By the birth of
[1:24:39] the woman, we die. And by the birth of
[1:24:42] the man, we live.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to take you to some
[1:24:51] scripture that started this all in my in
[1:24:55] my thoughts. And uh you'll have to
[1:24:58] forgive me if I'm just going a little
[1:25:00] bit laborious here.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Turn if you would to Luke's Gospel,
[1:25:08] the 20th chapter.
[1:25:16] And we're going to read at verse 20.
[1:25:20] Jesus is answering the Sadducees
[1:25:22] concerning the resurrection.
[1:25:39] 27
[1:25:41] Then came to him certain of the
[1:25:44] Sadducees which denied that there is any
[1:25:46] resurrection. And they asked him,
[1:25:48] saying, "Master, Moses wrote unto us, if
[1:25:53] any man's brother die, having a wife,
[1:25:56] and he die without children, that his
[1:25:58] brother should take his wife and raise
[1:26:00] up seed unto his brother." There were
[1:26:03] therefore seven brethren of the first,
[1:26:06] and the first took a wife, and died
[1:26:08] without children. The second took her to
[1:26:11] wife and and he died childless. And the
[1:26:14] third took her and in the manner in like
[1:26:16] manner the seven also and they left no
[1:26:19] children and died. Last of all the woman
[1:26:22] died also. Therefore in the resurrection
[1:26:26] whose wife of them is she? For seven had
[1:26:29] her to wife. And Jesus answering said
[1:26:32] unto them, the children of this world
[1:26:36] marry. Notice the children of this world
[1:26:39] marry and are given in marriage. Now
[1:26:43] he's talking about being childless and
[1:26:47] not bringing forth a child. So the whole
[1:26:50] subject isn't so much about the seven
[1:26:53] had her but they weren't a they had her
[1:26:56] because they were supposed to raise up a
[1:26:58] child supposed to raise up children and
[1:27:01] and uh the children of this world. Verse
[1:27:05] 34, marry and are given in marriage. But
[1:27:08] they which shall be accounted worthy to
[1:27:11] obtain the world and the resurrection
[1:27:14] from the dead, neither marry nor are
[1:27:17] given in marriage. Neither can they die
[1:27:20] anymore. For they are equal unto the
[1:27:24] angels and are the children of God,
[1:27:27] being the children of the resurrection.
[1:27:29] Now he does not say that the angels are
[1:27:32] children of God. He said they are equal
[1:27:34] to the angels
[1:27:37] being children of God
[1:27:40] uh and are the children of God being the
[1:27:43] children of the resurrection. It's the
[1:27:45] children of the resurrection that that
[1:27:48] that give them this status of being
[1:27:50] children of God.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Now that the dead are raised, even Moses
[1:28:00] showed it at the bush. Verse 37. When he
[1:28:03] called the Lord the God of Abraham and
[1:28:06] the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob,
[1:28:09] for he is not a God of the dead, but of
[1:28:12] the living, for all live unto him. Our
[1:28:15] God is not a God of the dead, but a God
[1:28:17] of the living.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; And the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
[1:28:21] Jacob. Now, Matthew records it just a
[1:28:24] just slightly different in uh in the
[1:28:28] 22nd chapter of Matthew. And we're just
[1:28:32] going to read just a few verses there.
[1:28:34] 22nd chapter of Matthew
[1:28:39] and verse 29.
[1:28:43] Jesus answering said unto them, this is
[1:28:46] a Sadducees now. He'd gone through the
[1:28:48] same preliminary part. You do heir, not
[1:28:52] knowing the scriptures, nor the power of
[1:28:55] God. For in the resurrection they
[1:28:58] neither marry nor are given in marriage,
[1:29:01] but are as the angels of God in heaven,
[1:29:04] but as touching the resurrection of the
[1:29:07] dead. Have you not read that that that
[1:29:10] which was spoken unto you by God,
[1:29:12] saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the
[1:29:16] God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, God
[1:29:19] is not a God of the dead, but of the
[1:29:22] living. And when the multitude heard
[1:29:24] this, they were astonished at his
[1:29:27] doctrine.
[1:29:29] He's not the God of the dead, but a God
[1:29:33] of the living. Yeah.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; And so Jesus is saying in the
[1:29:39] resurrection,
[1:29:42] we don't marry and we aren't given in
[1:29:45] marriage
[1:29:47] according to God's wisdom and his
[1:29:52] uh and and in his economy. We are here
[1:29:55] in this life. There's a number of things
[1:29:57] that we we have here that is unique to
[1:30:00] this life. And one of them of course is
[1:30:03] the bringing forth of children. We marry
[1:30:06] and are given in marriage. But he says
[1:30:10] in the resurrection we are as the
[1:30:12] angels. We're not angels but we're as
[1:30:16] the angels. And the prophet goes into
[1:30:18] details. Brother Brandham beyond the
[1:30:20] curtain of time. He said the women were
[1:30:23] indeed women and the men were indeed
[1:30:26] men. But he says there was no sex
[1:30:28] glands.
[1:30:30] It did not exist. It was an absolute uh
[1:30:35] uh uh absolute void of anything having
[1:30:40] to do with any feeling or sense of uh of
[1:30:45] a of a sexual thought or relationship
[1:30:48] when a man they embraced one another.
[1:30:51] And it's something that we can scarcely
[1:30:53] grasp. But in this world now if you go
[1:30:57] back to multiply and replenish the earth
[1:31:01] and to find that now a creature that God
[1:31:04] had created, he had indeed created the
[1:31:08] angels and those angels which Satan drew
[1:31:12] out from heaven by his deception and
[1:31:14] they were called fallen angels and uh
[1:31:17] and you you can be certain that those
[1:31:19] fallen angels are demon spirits.
[1:31:23] Amen.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing how those uh you can
[1:31:30] find some of the most demonpossessed of
[1:31:32] people and they will be religious.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; They demons know all about worship
[1:31:39] because they came from the presence of
[1:31:41] God. They're not afraid of church.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; They're not afraid of the Bible.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; They will quote it.
[1:31:50] But you will find that all along the way
[1:31:54] there is always a a a sexual connotation
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; and they become obsessed that way.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Isn't it incredible that this world that
[1:32:04] we live in is so hellbent
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; with a perversion of the whole sexual
[1:32:11] experience.
[1:32:12] Just everything that you can even
[1:32:15] imagine or think about that Satan has
[1:32:19] managed to contaminate.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; He has made a mockery of marriage for
[1:32:24] example.
[1:32:25] He's made a mockery of even raising of
[1:32:28] children
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; and huge huge uh uh concern today in all
[1:32:36] kinds of things whether it's abortion or
[1:32:40] a a woman's right for abortion or
[1:32:43] non-abortion all of these things. I mean
[1:32:46] people get caught up in the in these
[1:32:48] programs or they get caught up in these
[1:32:50] causes. I'm for it and I'm against it. I
[1:32:54] can tell you one thing. The word of God
[1:32:56] is so far even beyond that. This world
[1:32:59] is truly hellbent.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; And it all has to do with the original
[1:33:05] sin. It's all pinned back to the
[1:33:08] original sin. You can't escape it. If
[1:33:11] they ate apples, this whole thing is an
[1:33:13] absolute confusion. If if Eve just ate
[1:33:16] something off a tree and all of this
[1:33:18] happened out of that, it's just a total
[1:33:20] chaos. But I can tell you it is
[1:33:22] absolutely clear. Satan wanted to
[1:33:25] possess he wanted to possess uh uh he
[1:33:30] wanted to actually
[1:33:32] possess an individual but there is a
[1:33:35] certain capacity.
[1:33:37] Listen now because this is getting this
[1:33:39] is going to be very very important.
[1:33:41] There's a certain capacity
[1:33:43] a there's a certain status and a certain
[1:33:46] position that Satan wanted to have. He
[1:33:49] desired to have. He wanted to ascend. He
[1:33:52] wanted to do what God was intending to
[1:33:54] do. And God's intent was that God was
[1:33:58] going to possess human beings
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; in a sense that Satan cannot possess
[1:34:04] them.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Now, Satan can cause them people to do
[1:34:07] things and so on, but God can actually
[1:34:10] and does by the power of transformation
[1:34:13] takes a place in the human life. So he
[1:34:16] permeates the entire being, changes his
[1:34:19] nature, changes his desires and that he
[1:34:22] has he is he is held back from Satan.
[1:34:43] God desires to indwell man. And
[1:34:47] therefore Satan desires the same
[1:34:49] position.
[1:34:51] And the scripture tells us which is
[1:34:53] familiar scriptures. How art thou fallen
[1:34:55] from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the
[1:34:57] morning. How thou art cut down to the
[1:34:59] ground which did weaken the nations. For
[1:35:02] thou hast said in thine heart, I will
[1:35:03] ascend into heaven. I will exalt my
[1:35:06] throne above the stars of God. I will
[1:35:08] sit also upon the mount of the
[1:35:10] congregation in the sides of the north.
[1:35:12] Now listen, the one he is speaking of,
[1:35:14] he says, I will ascend above. I will
[1:35:17] ascend above. Remember now that this God
[1:35:20] that could have said anything he could
[1:35:22] have said anything to Adam his son for
[1:35:26] the there's no time but we have a record
[1:35:29] of in the economy of eternity where God
[1:35:33] made one in his own image and now he has
[1:35:37] one in his own image and the first thing
[1:35:39] he says is
[1:35:41] be fruitful
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; multiply
[1:35:45] and replenish the earth That has to be a
[1:35:49] very significant statement.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Are you following me? That has to be a
[1:35:55] very powerful statement. That has to
[1:35:58] have priority in the mind of God. And
[1:36:01] you can be well assured. Satan knew
[1:36:04] that.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Satan knew that that was priority in
[1:36:08] God's mind. And he desired to have a
[1:36:11] position. Why was God even saying
[1:36:13] multiply and replenish the earth? Why
[1:36:16] was God saying that? Because in this he
[1:36:19] set aside this time. He set aside
[1:36:22] history whereby he would bring forth a
[1:36:24] family
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; to himself.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; And even though it fell, God's God's
[1:36:31] plan cannot be thwarted. God's plan
[1:36:35] cannot be voided out. God's still going
[1:36:38] to bring it. And he's going to bring it
[1:36:39] by redemption.
[1:36:43] Glory
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; in the Ephesians church age. I want you
[1:36:47] I'm not going to carry on long, but I
[1:36:49] want you to I want you just to this is
[1:36:52] so clear.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; I want you to catch this, please.
[1:36:58] In the Ephesians church age,
[1:37:02] brother Brandham's saying this.
[1:37:06] Now, why did this have to be so?
[1:37:10] Why was it that the seed of the serpent
[1:37:12] must come this way?
[1:37:15] Man was created for God.
[1:37:19] Man was to be the temple of God. The
[1:37:23] place of God's rest. The Holy Spirit
[1:37:27] was man, the temple.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit was going to indwell
[1:37:34] man. That's God's program. Amen.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; And then we read Acts, he reads Acts
[1:37:40] 7:46-51.
[1:37:43] Who found favor before God and desired
[1:37:45] to find a tabernacle, for the God of
[1:37:48] Jacob, but Solomon built him an house.
[1:37:50] How be it, the Most High dwelleth not in
[1:37:52] temples made with hands. Uh, as Seth
[1:37:56] prophet, heaven is my throne, and the
[1:37:59] earth is my foottool. What house will
[1:38:01] you build me, sayeth the Lord? or what
[1:38:04] is the place of my rest? My hand hath
[1:38:08] made all these things. Ye stiff necked
[1:38:10] and uncircumcised in hearts and ears, ye
[1:38:13] to always resist the Holy Ghost. As your
[1:38:16] fathers did, so do ye. He said, "Satan
[1:38:21] has known this all along.
[1:38:24] He also wants to indwell man." I want
[1:38:29] this congregation and all listening on
[1:38:30] the internet to listen very closely.
[1:38:33] Satan has always known this. He's known
[1:38:34] this all along. He also wants to indwell
[1:38:38] man even as God does. But God has
[1:38:43] reserved to himself that right.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; This is the key.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; God has reserved to himself that right.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; But this is what he desired in Eden.
[1:38:59] and he's done the next best thing for
[1:39:01] himself.
[1:39:04] Satan cannot do that. I underlined it. I
[1:39:09] I highlighted it. I put it in red. I put
[1:39:12] it in yellow. And I rejoice over it.
[1:39:15] Satan cannot do that.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; God alone appeared in human flesh.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God alone appeared in human
[1:39:31] flesh.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Do you mind if I get enthused about
[1:39:34] this? God alone appeared in human flesh.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Satan could not and cannot do that. He
[1:39:47] does not have creative powers. The only
[1:39:51] way for Satan to accomplish
[1:39:54] what he wanted to do was to enter the
[1:39:57] serpent in Eden as he entered by evil
[1:40:00] spirits into the swine of Geria.
[1:40:04] God does not enter animals, but Satan
[1:40:07] can and will accomplish his ends.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; He could not have a child directly by
[1:40:15] Eve as God did by Mary.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:40:20] Hallelujah.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; He could not have a child by Eve as God
[1:40:25] did by Mary.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; So he entered into the serpent and then
[1:40:31] beguiled Eve. He seduced her and by her
[1:40:34] Satan and by her did Satan have a child
[1:40:38] vicariously.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; He did not have a he it was not his
[1:40:43] child. He used the serpent to do so and
[1:40:46] he had one vicariously. Cain bore,
[1:40:50] listen closely, Cain bore the full
[1:40:54] spiritual characteristics of Satan.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; And the anim animalistic, sensual,
[1:41:01] fleshly characteristic of the serpent
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; cannot be denied. He bore the full
[1:41:10] spiritual the full spiritual
[1:41:13] characteristic of Satan and the full
[1:41:16] physical characteristic of the serpent.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you for that.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:41:31] No wonder the Holy Spirit said, The Holy
[1:41:35] Spirit said,
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; "Don't lose it."
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit said Cain was of that
[1:41:44] wicked one.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; For he was.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit wrote this book.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit said it.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Can you take it?
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Can you accept it? The Holy Spirit said
[1:41:59] it.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is the author of this
[1:42:02] book. The Holy Spirit said in this book,
[1:42:05] Cain is of the serpent.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; To deny that is doubt
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; and to doubt it is death.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; God will not bless doubt. Right.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; When man
[1:42:27] Now, here's a here's God's first
[1:42:30] commission. Can I take another few
[1:42:31] moments?
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Here's God's first commission.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Be fruitful,
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; multiply, and replenish.
[1:42:42] Then the scripture tells us just in
[1:42:44] chapter 6, "And when men multiplied,
[1:42:51] when men multiplied,
[1:42:54] sin covered the earth
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; to such a degree and to such a depth
[1:42:59] that God says, I'll destroy it."
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Now, how could he be destroying the
[1:43:05] result of his commandment?
[1:43:08] So what what the product was not the
[1:43:11] product of his word
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; when men multiplied in chapter 6 was not
[1:43:16] the fulfillment of what he said to Adam
[1:43:19] multiply
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; and replenish the earth
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; something got in there
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; and it's none other than Satan through
[1:43:27] the instrumentality of the serpent and
[1:43:30] then God cursing the serpent so that his
[1:43:32] his physical features are gone forever.
[1:43:36] He's not upright anymore.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; He was upright. He's not upright
[1:43:40] anymore.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; When man be to multiply in the message
[1:43:49] time is at hand and waxed great in the
[1:43:51] earth building cities and many people
[1:43:53] began to be fully populated.
[1:43:57] Wickedness set in among the hearts of
[1:43:58] the people. And the time came when God
[1:44:00] had to send judgment. God set a time for
[1:44:03] that judgment. And then he also had a
[1:44:06] preacher of righteousness for the name
[1:44:08] by the name of Noah. And he preached 120
[1:44:11] years and was turned down.
[1:44:15] Now just one more short reading and I'm
[1:44:17] going to close.
[1:44:19] Continuing in the Ephesian church age.
[1:44:22] And now that we've come this far, let me
[1:44:25] try to crystallize your thinking on this
[1:44:28] subject so you can see the necessity of
[1:44:31] our going into the serpent seed doctrine
[1:44:34] as I have. We start with the fact that
[1:44:37] there were two trees in the midst of the
[1:44:40] garden. The tree of life was Jesus and
[1:44:44] the other tree is definitely Satan
[1:44:48] because of what came forth of that tree.
[1:44:52] Amen.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; You can't just have a tree growing out
[1:44:55] of the ground out of the botney life pot
[1:44:58] ash and in that tree is the power uh to
[1:45:01] corrupt the earth.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Nonsense.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Utter nonsense.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Any child knows that you can't have a
[1:45:10] tree, a fig tree or some other tree or
[1:45:12] fruit tree corrupt the whole earth and
[1:45:14] bring all this death and bring all this
[1:45:16] trouble. One tree was Christ and he's
[1:45:19] found three times. He's found in Genesis
[1:45:21] and he's found in Revelation. He's found
[1:45:24] three times in the book of Revelation, I
[1:45:26] believe. Three times in the book of
[1:45:27] Genesis. But the tree of knowledge of
[1:45:29] good and evil does not appear in the
[1:45:32] book of Revelation. He's cast out.
[1:45:36] He's cast into the lake of fire. He's
[1:45:38] done away with. And God in the in the
[1:45:42] meantime has brought forth his family. A
[1:45:45] family of faith, a family who has
[1:45:47] believed on his and he came and
[1:45:50] satisfied his own judgment. In the day
[1:45:52] you do in the day you eat there of you
[1:45:54] shall surely die. And God brought forth
[1:45:56] his seed of the woman Mary. And he went
[1:45:59] to the cross and by death he slew him
[1:46:02] who had power of death.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:46:07] Praise God.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; The other tree is definitely
[1:46:12] Satan because of what came forth of the
[1:46:14] tree.
[1:46:16] Now he said we know that both of those
[1:46:19] trees had a relationship to man or they
[1:46:24] would never have been placed there.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Both of these trees have a relationship
[1:46:30] to man or they would not have been
[1:46:33] placed there. They must have had a part
[1:46:35] in the sovereign plan and purpose of God
[1:46:40] in their relationship to mankind and to
[1:46:42] himself or we could never impute
[1:46:46] omniscience unto God. This is all true
[1:46:49] so far, is it not? Amen.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Now, the word most definitely sets forth
[1:46:54] that from before the foundation of the
[1:46:57] world or the earth, the purpose of God
[1:47:00] has to was to share his eternal life
[1:47:03] with man.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Before the be before the foundations of
[1:47:08] the earth,
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; the purpose of God was to share his
[1:47:13] eternal life. Yeah,
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Zoe life,
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; God's life
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; with man. You can see why Satan wanted
[1:47:25] to use every instrumentality
[1:47:28] that was available to him to to
[1:47:32] interject and try and destroy and and
[1:47:36] take man away from God's eternal
[1:47:39] purpose, which was to give him his own
[1:47:41] life.
[1:47:47] according as he hath chosen us in him.
[1:47:50] Ephesians 1, before the foundation of
[1:47:53] the world that we should be holy and
[1:47:55] without blame before him in love and so
[1:47:58] on. I'm and and it goes on and reads
[1:48:01] also into Revelation 13:8. And all that
[1:48:04] dwell upon the earth shall worship him,
[1:48:07] Satan, whose names are not written in
[1:48:10] the book of life of the lamb slain
[1:48:14] before the foundation of the world.
[1:48:19] But that life could not and would not be
[1:48:23] shared in any other way than through the
[1:48:26] way of God manifested in the flesh. This
[1:48:30] was a part of his eternal and
[1:48:32] predestinated purpose. Remember what we
[1:48:34] said a moment ago.
[1:48:36] Only God can actually manifest himself
[1:48:40] and indwell. And the scripture says,
[1:48:43] "And the word was with God. The word was
[1:48:47] God and the word became flesh."
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; There's no place where Satan can take
[1:48:53] that process.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; God has reserved certain aspects. He can
[1:49:01] go thus far and no further.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Satan had to come through flesh also.
[1:49:14] Listen. But Satan could not come through
[1:49:17] human flesh to make the fall as would
[1:49:20] Christ come in human flesh to restore
[1:49:23] the fallen.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Satan could not come through human
[1:49:29] flesh.
[1:49:31] But there was an animal,
[1:49:34] the serpent, so close to man. I might
[1:49:37] just drop in here, maybe you'll
[1:49:39] understand. And now I've read the quote
[1:49:40] a number of times where where medical
[1:49:43] science even now this clinic down just
[1:49:46] south of San Diego in in Mexico and
[1:49:49] where it's a it's a an accepted thing
[1:49:51] today that they can take the cells of a
[1:49:55] fetus of an animal and they use a fetus
[1:49:59] perhaps of a cow or or a lamb but they
[1:50:02] can take they can take a young cow which
[1:50:05] is a fetus still in the womb of its
[1:50:07] mother and They take that fetus and they
[1:50:11] take the cells of of the main major
[1:50:16] organs of that fetus. They take the
[1:50:18] cells of that those organs and and and
[1:50:22] they have taken now because those cells
[1:50:25] know no disease. They are pure cells and
[1:50:30] they take people that have diseases and
[1:50:33] inject if it's a if it's a liver cells
[1:50:36] or a thyroid cell or different kind of
[1:50:40] cells they take those cells and inject
[1:50:42] them into the human
[1:50:44] sister
[1:50:47] Nelson Guy pastor in Newfanland one of
[1:50:51] the pastors brother Nelson Guy who was
[1:50:54] here at brother Mike's funeral
[1:50:56] his wife many years ago was at death's
[1:51:00] door and medical science could do
[1:51:03] nothing for her and she was dying
[1:51:06] literally dying and we here were praying
[1:51:09] and and Mike and Marilyn then were on
[1:51:11] the island and they they were praying
[1:51:13] and and there were people who knew them
[1:51:15] well and we were praying for this for
[1:51:18] this woman pastor's wife she was being
[1:51:21] taken prematurely
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; and uh and brother Nelson I was in touch
[1:51:27] with brother Lee Vale and brother Lee
[1:51:30] told him of this portion in the church
[1:51:32] age book where these cells were uh this
[1:51:36] this process was done and he heard that
[1:51:38] there was a doctor in in Mexico brother
[1:51:41] Nelson Guy told me himself personally
[1:51:43] that he called that doctor and the
[1:51:46] doctor told him these are the costs and
[1:51:49] this is what we'll do and this is the
[1:51:51] program and we do a certain amount of
[1:51:54] preparation with your wife and inject
[1:51:56] her with the with the cells for that
[1:51:58] part of her body that's diseased. And so
[1:52:02] Nelson Guy when he saw that in the
[1:52:03] church age book, he took his wife down
[1:52:05] there and they prepared her and and
[1:52:10] brother Brandham asked in the doctor who
[1:52:13] was a doctor from Germany and he had
[1:52:16] studied this in Germany and the the cell
[1:52:19] life. He was he he asked brother Nelson
[1:52:23] Guy when did William Brandon speak of
[1:52:26] this? When did this come out? He says
[1:52:28] well it was in the n early 1960s. He
[1:52:31] said that's just when this was
[1:52:32] perfected.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; It was right at that same time that this
[1:52:37] was perfected and they administered the
[1:52:40] cell therapy to sister Nelson guy who
[1:52:44] lives today as a healthy woman.
[1:52:48] Now, let me just say this. In the church
[1:52:50] age book, Brother Brandham says the
[1:52:52] thyroid cell will go right when it's
[1:52:56] injected in the person will go right to
[1:52:58] the thyroid.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; Now, catch this. It's a it it is coming
[1:53:02] from an animal kingdom
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; and it will go right to the thyroid, the
[1:53:10] bladder to the bladder, the stomach to
[1:53:12] the stomach, the liver to the liver. He
[1:53:15] said there is an intelligence.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; How does that cell know where to go?
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; There's an intelligence
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; in the whole creation of of the animal
[1:53:28] kingdom. And that's why science tells us
[1:53:30] we're animal as far as of being a mammal
[1:53:32] is concerned. And he says there is an
[1:53:35] affinity between those two. And that
[1:53:38] cell will go directly to that cell.
[1:53:41] There's an intelligence behind it what
[1:53:43] tells it where to go. I tell you my
[1:53:46] brother and my sister and we had a
[1:53:47] prophet messenger stand on the earth who
[1:53:50] was tapped into the very mind of God.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; The God that spoke the creative power
[1:53:56] and brought forth the entire uh entire
[1:53:59] kingdom of the animal kingdom and botney
[1:54:02] life and all of these things. I tell you
[1:54:04] there's no scientist like our God.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; And told him exactly. And here he puts
[1:54:09] it for you and I to read. Uh unbelievers
[1:54:11] will doubt it and don't believe it and
[1:54:13] that's fine. That's their part. But as
[1:54:16] for my part, I believed it.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; I do believe it. I believe it now. I
[1:54:20] believe it more now than I ever did.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; I believe in that intelligence. And I
[1:54:28] believe that intelligence
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; which even guides a cell
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; of a unborn fetus to go to the needy
[1:54:36] needy part of a human body and and and
[1:54:39] and not very long ago we had people that
[1:54:43] were down there and they're busy. They
[1:54:45] got the who's who of the world coming in
[1:54:47] there trying to get over their
[1:54:50] sicknesses and diseases and some are too
[1:54:52] far advanced to do anything. There has
[1:54:53] to be a certain time that this can
[1:54:55] happen. And I'm not promoting them
[1:54:57] whatsoever. I'm simply saying what God's
[1:55:00] prophet said was absolutely the truth.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; And years later, it's proven to be the
[1:55:05] truth.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; And it shows that there's an affinity
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; between the serpent, the animal kingdom,
[1:55:15] and mankind,
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; and this body. You know as well as I do.
[1:55:20] You're humans. You know as well as I do.
[1:55:22] You know what you're susceptible to. And
[1:55:24] Satan would try to use everything that
[1:55:26] God has said and made pure. Look at the
[1:55:29] mockery he's made. Look at the whole
[1:55:32] world is is is just absolutely sexually
[1:55:34] mad.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Every joke and all the programs and all
[1:55:39] the television and the newspapers are so
[1:55:41] full of it. I get sick. I don't get
[1:55:43] newspaper to my home.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; It's so vile,
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; so sexually oriented. Why? Because
[1:55:50] that's where it started. Amen.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; And nobody can deny that. And I want to
[1:55:56] make another announcement. God has
[1:55:58] already announced an end. For in the
[1:56:01] resurrection, they neither marry nor are
[1:56:04] given in marriage. I say, "Thank God.
[1:56:07] All of that will be done away with.
[1:56:24] There was an animal, the serpent, so
[1:56:27] close to man that Satan could get to
[1:56:29] that beast. And through that beast, he
[1:56:32] could get to human flesh and cause the
[1:56:35] fall and inject himself thereby into the
[1:56:39] human race. Even as Jesus would one day
[1:56:42] come and inject himself into the human
[1:56:45] race, into human bodies.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Even to the extent of the resurrection
[1:56:54] wherein we would have bodies like under
[1:56:57] his glorified body.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This Satan cannot do. This
[1:57:02] the serpent could not do. But our Lord
[1:57:05] Jesus by the Holy Ghost has injected
[1:57:08] himself
[1:57:10] into a people today. Oh, I wouldn't be
[1:57:12] outside of that, friends, for anything.
[1:57:14] I wouldn't be outside of that for
[1:57:16] anything. And that has been my message
[1:57:18] in the last three services. It is this
[1:57:20] life that is pulsating in the believer.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not getting done, but I just want to
[1:57:28] end right now.
[1:57:30] He says, "And then there was to come a
[1:57:33] day when God would appear in flesh and
[1:57:36] by means of his humiliation, he would
[1:57:38] restore man. He would restore fallen man
[1:57:41] and make him a partaker of that eternal
[1:57:44] life. Make him a partaker. He would come
[1:57:46] and become sinful flesh for us that we
[1:57:50] would be a partaker of Zoe life, not a
[1:57:53] human life. You came by human life. You
[1:57:56] may be British or German or Canadian or
[1:57:58] American or Russian or whatever more. By
[1:58:00] that we die. By the woman we die. But by
[1:58:04] this one who came we live.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got Zoe life.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; If you have come to him and acknowledge
[1:58:12] him and believe his word, we have Zoe
[1:58:14] life.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; And that life pulsates in the believer.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; That life causes us to do things that
[1:58:21] are strange. That life causes us to do
[1:58:23] things you don't understand. It bypasses
[1:58:26] your mental mind. Your the capacity of
[1:58:29] your mind is not great enough to
[1:58:31] comprehend what God is doing. I said to
[1:58:34] you in the last service, I believe I
[1:58:37] just made reference. I was going to read
[1:58:38] it today. We don't have time. I I I
[1:58:42] spoke to you about the widow of Zerapath
[1:58:45] and uh and and she was out collecting
[1:58:48] her toothpicks
[1:58:50] and and it was so remarkable to me. But
[1:58:52] one thought I didn't bring and I it just
[1:58:54] come fresh to me again.
[1:58:57] She was out making preparations to die.
[1:59:02] But I want to I just want to describe
[1:59:03] this to you before I close.
[1:59:06] The scripture says
[1:59:09] that there had been
[1:59:11] the famine in Samaria was sore.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; It was sore. and see everywhere she
[1:59:20] looked, she could see death
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; everywhere.
[1:59:25] God, who had allowed Elijah to declare
[1:59:28] this, had also told him, "Go up to the
[1:59:32] brook and be by the brook
[1:59:36] uh Cherith, believe it is." And uh you
[1:59:39] be by the brook, and the ravens, I've
[1:59:42] commanded them to feed you. The Bible
[1:59:45] says after a season even that brook
[1:59:48] dried up.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; I want to declare to you we are in a
[1:59:54] famine. A spiritual famine such as this
[1:59:58] world has never witnessed.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual famine. While a billion
[2:00:04] will chase after Islam and another
[2:00:07] hundreds of millions will chase after
[2:00:09] Hinduism and others after Buddhism.
[2:00:12] maybe a billion or more after Buddhism.
[2:00:14] And there's a handful of people that
[2:00:16] hear of Jesus Christ and of his
[2:00:19] sacrifice of Calvary. And there is no
[2:00:21] other name.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; There is no other sacrifice.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; We're in a famine.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; There has never been a day like this day
[2:00:32] with such a famine
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; in the land. And if you have spiritual
[2:00:37] eyes, all you need to do when you leave
[2:00:39] this building, you go to a restaurant
[2:00:41] and you go down the street and wherever
[2:00:44] it is, you look around. And if you got
[2:00:46] spiritual eyes, all you see is is is
[2:00:48] famine.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; And you see death everywhere.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; And man in his wisdom, in all of his
[2:00:58] wisdom, has so polluted the earth
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; that even the animals are crying. Even
[2:01:03] the animals are dying
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; and the air is polluted and the ground
[2:01:07] is polluted
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; and the very food that the people eat
[2:01:11] and the animals eat is polluted. It It's
[2:01:14] never been like Eden was
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; there. Everything is Satan's Eden.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; And they can try to doctor it up and
[2:01:24] make it as pretty as possible. They'll
[2:01:26] never be able to do so. It's a
[2:01:28] contaminated world
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; by the perverter of all things.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; And you go and and walk around and go to
[2:01:37] the mall. I don't care where you go.
[2:01:39] Everywhere you go,
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; it's death.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Nothing but death. But Satan, this
[2:01:49] master of cunning, has got people to
[2:01:52] believe
[2:01:54] that they're living it.
[2:01:57] Oh, this is
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; this is so great.
[2:02:01] So great.
[2:02:03] I told you about I stood behind a man.
[2:02:06] I was in a places are have gone places
[2:02:09] where I don't even recognize them
[2:02:10] anymore. I stood behind a man in a in a
[2:02:14] in a
[2:02:16] pharmacy here not too long ago
[2:02:19] and he said something to the I wasn't
[2:02:21] paying attention and the girl reached
[2:02:23] around and brought down a carton of
[2:02:25] cigarettes
[2:02:27] and he threw down a $100 bill. Thought
[2:02:30] wow man I don't know if she's even going
[2:02:32] to accept that you know threw down a
[2:02:35] hundred bill dollar bill. She rung it up
[2:02:38] and gave him about 30 bucks back.
[2:02:40] I thought I almost forgot what I was
[2:02:43] going to buy.
[2:02:46] $70
[2:02:48] and he's going to put that in his mouth
[2:02:50] and inhale that cancer into his lungs
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; and put the rest of up and smoke so he
[2:02:57] can pollute the air and pollute himself
[2:03:00] and think he's having a good time.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:03:06] I tell you what, friends,
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; and pay for it.
[2:03:14] Sometimes you have people in the world,
[2:03:16] you know, and they want to get at the
[2:03:18] believer. Oh yeah, you and this or you
[2:03:20] know, how do you pay for this church and
[2:03:22] you live in a nice home and everything
[2:03:24] else? Once in a while I just get, you
[2:03:26] know, I get a little nasty and I say, I
[2:03:29] paid for my home with all the booze you
[2:03:31] drink and all the cigarettes you smoke.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; That's how I paid for my home.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; And you'd have had one, too. I tell
[2:03:39] them, you'd have had one, too. You'd
[2:03:41] have had a place for your family if you
[2:03:43] hadn't set it all up in smoke. Some
[2:03:45] devil deceive a person. I say, "Thank
[2:03:47] God for deliverance from that."
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; In the resurrection,
[2:03:57] they'll not be so. So, and this woman
[2:04:01] from Zarapath
[2:04:07] and she was indeed
[2:04:09] surrounded by death everywhere.
[2:04:12] But she did not realize because she had
[2:04:15] not known yet that the very life that
[2:04:18] was in her was pulsating
[2:04:22] and leading her directly to life.
[2:04:26] Amen.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; She already had life in the midst of the
[2:04:29] famine but didn't know it.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; And some of you that are here, I want to
[2:04:33] announce to you, if I need to announce
[2:04:34] to you that in the midst of the famine,
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; God has given you a provision.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; Far beyond far beyond anything of of the
[2:04:46] world that's around you. far beyond
[2:04:49] anything that would try to detract or
[2:04:52] take away from from the spiritual life
[2:04:54] that God has given.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; No one, no power can take this Zoey life
[2:05:00] from you.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Zoe life is God's life.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; God's children have Zoey life.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Gracious and loving heavenly father,
[2:05:19] how your word moves us.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I I want to personally just
[2:05:26] give you thanksgiving,
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; your ways are true,
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; your word is true,
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; and your program is being fulfilled.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; And we shall by your grace, we shall
[2:05:40] finish the course that you've given for
[2:05:42] us. I pray for every person that's
[2:05:44] within the sound of my voice and those
[2:05:46] that are here in the sanctuary today.
[2:05:49] Lord, I pray you'll bless them. Some of
[2:05:51] them perhaps are facing a difficult time
[2:05:54] just now. Some of them have uh someone
[2:05:56] who's on their heart, someone that
[2:05:58] they're holding very dear to them. I
[2:06:01] pray that you will loose the feathers
[2:06:03] that bind the unbeliever, oh God, and
[2:06:06] bring them to a place of faith. Bring
[2:06:09] them to a place, oh God, where their
[2:06:11] where their faith will materialize for
[2:06:14] them.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Father, we have some that are still out
[2:06:17] of the way. We have some that are still
[2:06:19] in the paths of death. We have some, oh
[2:06:22] God, who if they continue the direction
[2:06:24] they're going, we'll will find
[2:06:26] themselves sorely sorely wounded for the
[2:06:29] wages of sinners death. But the gift of
[2:06:31] God is eternal life. Oh God, this Zoey
[2:06:35] life that we have so cherished today,
[2:06:38] bless, I pray, your people. And perhaps
[2:06:41] today, even now, Lord, you'll bless
[2:06:43] someone. Perhaps they've come to church
[2:06:45] and been part of the congregation, but
[2:06:48] have not participated yet, have not
[2:06:50] received Zoey Life. I pray that they
[2:06:53] will do so by the new birth. We ask in
[2:06:56] the name of Jesus Christ, I commit this
[2:06:58] word to you now for your glory alone.
[2:07:01] Amen. Amen.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Thank you for your
[2:07:05] time and your patience. We've been a
[2:07:07] little bit long this morning, but I'd
[2:07:09] like to have you turn if you would
[2:07:11] please. And we're going to sing,
[2:07:15] Faith of Our Fathers.
[2:07:20] It's number
[2:07:23] I think you have that
[2:07:27] faith of our fathers living still. Would
[2:07:30] you stand with me and sing this from
[2:07:32] your heart?
[2:07:34] [Music]
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Faith of our father
[2:07:41] living
[2:07:42] still
[2:07:44] in spite of dark and fire and sword.
[2:07:51] Oh, how our hearts be high with joy.
[2:07:58] Where we hear that glorious
[2:08:03] word
[2:08:05] faith
[2:08:07] [Music]
[2:08:09] holy
[2:08:11] face
[2:08:12] we will be true to thee till death
[2:08:20] our father changing
[2:08:24] prison
[2:08:26] [Music]
[2:08:28] still in heart and consious
[2:08:33] free.
[2:08:34] How sweet would be their children's
[2:08:40] face
[2:08:42] if they like them could die for me.
[2:08:49] In God's
[2:08:52] holy
[2:08:54] gra
[2:08:56] we will be true to thee till death
[2:09:03] [Music]
[2:09:04] on our father
[2:09:07] we will love
[2:09:11] both friend and f in all our strife
[2:09:18] and reach the
[2:09:21] as love goes out
[2:09:25] by kindly words and
[2:09:30] life
[2:09:32] f of the father
[2:09:36] holy
[2:09:37] face
[2:09:39] we will be true to the
[2:09:45] end oh faith
[2:09:48] of our father's
[2:09:51] holy name.
[2:09:54] We will be true to thee till
[2:10:01] [Applause]
[2:10:04] it's our testimony.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; We bless your name, Lord.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; We thank you.
[2:10:17] Holy Spirit,
[2:10:20] you are welcome in this place.
[2:10:23] You're welcome in these temples.
[2:10:26] You're welcome to indwell these vessels.
[2:10:29] And we believe your word.
[2:10:32] Oh, almighty God, we believe your word.
[2:10:36] Satan cannot occupy the individual like
[2:10:40] that. People become demonpossessed and
[2:10:42] do all kinds of terrible things. and the
[2:10:46] world is full of it. But oh God, you
[2:10:48] have reserved the indwelling of man to
[2:10:52] yourself and by the Holy Spirit, you
[2:10:56] come and literally indwell down into the
[2:10:59] regions of the soul.
[2:11:02] We're not moved by some emotion, but
[2:11:05] we're being moved by the Holy Ghost.
[2:11:08] Even as men of ancient times spake as
[2:11:11] you said in your word as they were moved
[2:11:13] by the Holy Ghost. We carry the burden
[2:11:16] of the word of the Lord. We carry the
[2:11:19] burden of this message. We carry the
[2:11:21] burden of its fulfillment and
[2:11:23] manifestation. I say, oh God, declare
[2:11:26] yourself, manifest yourself and show if
[2:11:29] this word is true today, do that which
[2:11:32] is impossible
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. I wonder
[2:11:36] who is here. seeking to believe for
[2:11:38] something that seems to be impossible. I
[2:11:41] want to hear a testimony from you. I
[2:11:43] want your heart to be raised in faith
[2:11:45] right now. I want you to raise your hand
[2:11:47] and make a declaration. I'm believing
[2:11:50] for that which my senses declares
[2:11:52] impossible, but my faith declares is
[2:11:55] possible.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, we have seen the impossible. We've
[2:12:00] seen, oh God, how you've worked in
[2:12:02] homes. We have your wives and husbands,
[2:12:05] oh God. We have the impossible that has
[2:12:08] taken place. I give you glory in the
[2:12:11] very face of Satan himself. I give you
[2:12:14] praise and glory. I know that the devil
[2:12:17] comes to church. He comes here to
[2:12:19] church. And I want to declare to him,
[2:12:21] God indwells this vessel. And God is
[2:12:25] declaring, Satan, you're defeated
[2:12:29] in all of this situation.
[2:12:32] Let the chain be loose now. Let the
[2:12:35] chains fall.
[2:12:37] Let prodal sons come to theirelves.
[2:12:41] Let prodical daughters awaken
[2:12:44] in the name of Jesus Christ. For we're
[2:12:47] here to do business for the eternal God.
[2:12:50] May someone start on their heavenly
[2:12:52] homeward way.
[2:12:54] May they cast off and deny the enemy
[2:12:58] now. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ be
[2:13:02] glorified.
[2:13:03] My brother, my sister, I feel I feel
[2:13:06] that we deserve we we owe it to the Lord
[2:13:08] who deserves our thanksgiving for the
[2:13:12] mighty things he's done in our lives.
[2:13:17] All hail of power of Jesus name.
[2:13:20] Oh, let angels prostrate fall. Bring
[2:13:24] forth a royal diadem and crown him Lord
[2:13:27] of all.
[2:13:29] My God, my God.
[2:13:31] My God, my God dwells. He dwells in his
[2:13:35] saints.
[2:13:37] [Music]
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[2:13:49] [Music]
[2:13:55] [Music]
[2:14:00] I want to hear the cry.
[2:14:03] [Music]

[2:14:16] of the shackle
[2:14:18] from the orange
[2:14:21] of time. Lift it up.
[2:14:25] of his feet there.
[2:14:30] Oh, see the tears
[2:14:33] of the broken
[2:14:36] the cry
[2:14:39] [Music]

[2:14:47] Oh

[2:16:45] worthy
[2:16:54] worthy
[2:16:56] lamb that was saved.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Tony, I'm going to ask you if
[2:17:02] you'll come forward, please. Nice to
[2:17:04] have brother Tony, Sister Rebecca back.
[2:17:07] Brother Tony will be ready on Wednesday
[2:17:09] night to tell us about the work
[2:17:12] especially in Usbekiststan.
[2:17:15] So we're anxious to hear about that and
[2:17:17] see whatever he's prepared for us.
[2:17:20] We love him, don't we? Amen.
[2:17:25] [Music]
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; Precious friends,
[2:17:30] I announce to you
[2:17:32] the things that you are plagued with,
[2:17:35] the things that you're bombarded with,
[2:17:39] God has already signed an end to it.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:47] [Applause]
[2:17:50] I think of you young people and what it
[2:17:52] is you're subjected to and all the
[2:17:55] vulgarity and the vile things of this
[2:17:58] world. I say to every man and woman and
[2:18:01] young person in this place, God has
[2:18:04] already assigned an end to it.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You'll be changed in your
[2:18:11] body in a moment, in the twinkling of an
[2:18:13] eye. And you'll never, never again
[2:18:16] struggle with any of these things that
[2:18:18] Satan has perpetrated. And some of it is
[2:18:21] is illegal.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; As we heard the other night, it's
[2:18:25] illegal. He has no right to you.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ has already
[2:18:31] paid that penalty. And I can say today,
[2:18:34] you are free.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; I am free.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Isn't that good
[2:18:40] news? You're free.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Don't ever allow that enemy by default
[2:18:46] to try to hold you in subjection.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; You're not in subjection to him.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; The redeemed of the Lord are free.
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Tony, God bless you.
[2:19:07] Hallelujah.
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word
[2:19:15] today.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, at the entrance of your word came
[2:19:19] life into our souls, Father,
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. Oh God, the power of Zoe
[2:19:25] life resident within us. Lord, that
[2:19:28] death sentence that was over our bodies,
[2:19:31] over our lives, was ended at the moment
[2:19:33] that we became the children of the
[2:19:35] resurrection. And Lord Jesus, there is a
[2:19:38] greater power. There is a greater life
[2:19:40] within us now. And Father, as we would
[2:19:42] go our separate ways today, oh Father,
[2:19:45] may you help us, Lord. May we recognize
[2:19:48] that we're not just born of flesh, but
[2:19:50] we're born of the will of God, born by
[2:19:51] the spirit of God to bring this body of
[2:19:54] death into subjection and under the
[2:19:57] power of your word. Father, we thank you
[2:19:59] for this glorious word. We're thankful
[2:20:01] that a man was able to get himself out
[2:20:03] of the way that brother Ed was able to
[2:20:06] enter into another channel of
[2:20:07] inspiration, Lord, and be a mouthpiece
[2:20:10] for you, the Holy Spirit, to have spoken
[2:20:13] today, Lord. Let that word dwell richly
[2:20:15] in our hearts. And as we go from here,
[2:20:18] we pray your blessing upon each and
[2:20:19] everyone and upon our mothers, Father,
[2:20:22] we remember them and celebrate that
[2:20:24] fifth gospel today, Father. Oh Lord
[2:20:26] Jesus, bless brother Ed. Bless each and
[2:20:29] every one of us. bring us back at the
[2:20:31] appointed time, Lord, with this fire,
[2:20:33] with this burning life, this Zoe life
[2:20:36] burning in our soul. And bless Brother
[2:20:38] John, Lord, as we come back to the
[2:20:40] household of faith to feast upon the
[2:20:42] word that you've spread before us this
[2:20:44] day, as we ask all these mercies in
[2:20:46] Jesus name. We thank you. Amen. Thank
[2:20:49] you, brother Tony. God bless you.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; Lord willing, we'll see you this
[2:20:56] evening,
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; 5:00 rather late this afternoon. You're
[2:21:00] dismissed in Jesus' name. Greet one
[2:21:02] another and especially to every mother.
[2:21:04] Say happy Mother's Day. God bless you.
