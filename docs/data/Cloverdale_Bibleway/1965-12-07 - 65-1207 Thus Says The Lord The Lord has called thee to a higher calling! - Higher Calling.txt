TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God bless you God bless you are you looking in a mirror I ask you in Christ's name are you looking in God's mirror behold my people even this hour am I moving upon thy hearts even this hour will thou judge thyself or if Thou shalt judge thyself the Lord will not judge thee nor condemn thee behold the Lord hath called thee to a high and holy calling y even now do the Lord brood over thee in love and in Mercy y if Thou shalt confess thy sin y the Lord shall cleanse thee and forgive thee and he shall cause thee to Bow up with wings as Eagles and thou shalt be filled with his power and he shall wash thee by the water of his word he shall renew thee he shall change thy heart and give thee a heart of Flesh for behold the day of the Lord is at hand will thou even as the old word World old who paid no attention to my preacher no who went about unconcerned and complacent who Dishonored God yay and then s it the Holy Spirit what about in everyday life as though the Lord matter what he said and what he would do for behold the word of the Lord overtook them and behold they all perished therefore I say unto thee this is an evil hour this is an evil day and thou shalt not be deceived and thou shal be led by my spirit and conformed to my word for behold I shall keep thee and preserve thee and I shall keep thee true and I shall revive thee until the day of my coming amen
