We want to remember our brother Diversson. He was here fellowshipping with us for a couple years and he and his family are in London, Ontario now and they lost a daughter only a few months old and she passed away just this last week on July 24th. We just desire that the Lord would be a strength and a comfort to them during this time. Why don't we just lift them up as if we were in their shoes. Amen. And I appreciate our brother Dersonson.

We're just going to continue with this atmosphere of worship. We have a couple specials, but maybe before we turn to them, why don't we just sing All That I Have, All That I Am. Amen. Oh, all that I have. Oh, and all that I am. All I shall ever be. It cannot It cannot repay. I Lord I surrender to thee all that I have. Oh that I have. When all that I am and know I shall ever be.

Uh we love to worship, don't we? &gt;&gt; We're just going to sing a worship song up here. I pray that you'll worship with us. It's one thing that um we start here. Worship take it right into eternity. &gt;&gt; Crosses over to both sides. &gt;&gt; So we might as well get started now. &gt;&gt; This song is called Worship is Forever. Worship is free. Worship is everlasting. Worship will cross from this life to eternity. Mountains may crumble and fall into the sea, but worship forever. Wonderful to worship. &gt;&gt; Counselor worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; Mighty God everlasting father worship is forever. Worship is right. Worship is complete. Worship will pass through the veil to eternity. He cast off your shackles and set your spirit free for you were born to worship. Prince of peace. Want to worship worship &gt;&gt; Emmanuel. &gt;&gt; I want to worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we just rose &gt;&gt; praise him of the valley. &gt;&gt; Praise him. Worship his forever. And it would take forever to start to find the words to tell one part of just the least of what he's done for you and me. And I would find a million times too few to sing the half of all the praise he's due. Though twice of every word of it were true. Worship is free. Mountains may crumble and fall into the sea, but worship is forever. It's in your soul. It's in your hands. It's in your hopes. Your dreams are planned. It's in your heart. It's in your mind. It's in the things you leave behind. It's in your eyes. It's on your face. It's what you shine and you embrace. The atmosphere your life creates. Everything communicates. It's how you work. It's how you play. It's how you live. From day to day, it's what you see. It's what you hear. It's what you let your heart come here. It's what you show. It's what you see. It's in and out and you dress. It's what you wear. Even how you wear your heads. Every look, every phrase showing something should be praised. &gt;&gt; Every word, every deed, shine a light. And so, it's how you serve. It's how you pray. It's how you give your life away. It's how you talk. It's how you sing. Worship covers everything. covers everything. &gt;&gt; Worship covers everything. &gt;&gt; Worship is forever. &gt;&gt; Worship covers everything. &gt;&gt; Worship is forever. &gt;&gt; Worship is forever. Amen. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. God bless you. Why don't we sing we worship you in spirit and in truth. Just before brother Biscll comes, uh it's a song that's been on my heart that I'm going to sing. I also want a couple uh remember a couple of announcements. There is a counselor's meeting directly after this morning's service. Uh I believe is that just in the chapel or the or the fellowship room? Fellowship room. So right after this morning's service, we will have a counselor's meeting and also a young people's choir. If you're of senior camp age, would like to be in the choir, please come Thursday evening, 700 p.m. I believe that's August the 2nd. We're going to prepare a couple songs for this year's camp. We're looking forward to it. Amen. That's when we sing. We worship you in spirit and in truth. We worship you, oh in spirit and in truth. Lord, we worship you in spirit and in truth. Lord, we have heard your word and felt your presence too. Oh, we worship you in spirit and in truth. We worship you, Lord. We worship you oh in spirit and in truth. We worship you in spirit and in truth. Oh, we have heard your word and felt your presence too. We worship you in spirit in truth. In this quiet place with you, I bow before your throne. I bear the deepest part of me. To you and you alone. I keep no secrets for there is no thought you have not known. I bring my best and all the rest to you and lay them down with all my heart. I want to love you, Lord, and give my life each day to know you more. All that is in me is yours completely. I'll serve you ally with all my heart. You faithfully supply my needs. according to your plan. So help me Lord to seek your face before I seek your help and trust you know what's best for me when I don't understand and follow in obedience in every circumstance. With all my heart I want to love you, Lord, and live my life each day to know you more. All that is in me is yours completely. I'll serve you holy with all my heart. I want to love you, Lord, and give my life each day to know you more. All that is in me is yours completely. I'll serve you all with all my heart. too. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Wonderful day. &gt;&gt; Sun is shining. &gt;&gt; To all you visitors, we want you to see the sun shines here on occasion. &gt;&gt; We've been enjoying it. Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Shine on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a good day whenever we can come into his presence and come to worship as the a whole family sang. I'm going to have you stand and uh I I want to sing that chorus, brother Ryan. Uh you are my everything. I thought of something that should just express what's in our hearts this morning. And I trusted something that's in your heart. Sister Biscll and I were just speaking on the way to the service this morning. She was just commenting. It's amazing how one thing, one event, one happening, just one occurrence in a person's life and there's something about it. You don't know exactly why, but it it it registers with you so profoundly that it's there for the rest of your life. And and Sister Biscll was just relating when she was a girl, uh perhaps 12 or 13 years old. She doesn't even recall exactly, but she remembers exactly the church. It was a Lutheran church, a little church in Dawson Creek. And a pastor, a minister's wife sang a special. And she said that special just uh it was as though it was indelibly marked upon her her own heart and mind. And whenever she sings it and sings it, I suppose to herself. said, "Whenever I sing those words," is that I see that woman. I can remember her just as clear as it was yesterday. I see the glory of God shining on her face. We don't know anything about her. All we know is she was certainly a daughter of God. And she conveyed something and she sang something of uh the I believe that you're all the all all the world to me or something like that. I just forget the song, but it's a song that's remembered forever. And I have been thinking the last few days because uh we were invited to Joseph Hildbrand's uh gathering, had a gathering for his birthday, 16th birthday. God bless you, brother Joseph. And it's wonderful to be 16. I wish I was there. I'd have a whole life. I'd just say, "Follow me, Joseph. if I'm on my way here to serve God. Now, I've had a few years experience and uh so I wrote in this card the scripture and I've written it in perhaps many of your Bibles. I received many letters from my father. He would write me generally once a month. We were apart for much of our lives and I was just a boy. Uh, and whenever f father wanted my attention, he would use my full name, Edward. And he was a great handwriter and he wrote in my this letter to me and he he said, "Edward, always pray that God will reveal himself to you." And he put John 14:21. He that hath my commandments and loveth me, he will be loved of my father, and we will come and I'll manifest myself to him." And I tell you what, I never forgot the truth of that. That was branded, that one event branded my heart. So I prayed just before I stood up here. I said, "Lord, let something of the songs that have been sung, let something of the word that will now be preached, let it brand somebody's life. &gt;&gt; Let it be eternally there. Let it be something born on the wings of a dove. &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Spirit bring it to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let it be lifechanging. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let it be me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just before we sing, I want to also remind you that this la next Friday will be the last prayer meeting before the camp. And brother Kyle has had it on his heart uh and sent me an email and I just felt a real witness. Brother Kyle, you had the mind of God. We'll have the prayer service in the in the fellowship room to make room for everyone. I think that all young people as well that are going to participate in the camp and everyone because we're we're in great expectation and I believe that God is going to not move just because it's camp but we because we set ourselves aside we're giving these days we're giving this time forget all the world and all the other activities that we have to be engaged in and let's join together in prayer and I believe that God will honor that so we'll have it so we have sufficient room in the fellowship room 7:30 on Friday evening and God bless you also uh nice to see brother Mike and sister Debbie Gier Satan has really given brother Mike a real uh difficult time for the last little while uh we want to talk about battles we also want to talk about victories &gt;&gt; and Brother Mike even had some pneumonia, but we're glad he's here this morning. They missed a number of meetings, but I just felt uh I would have had sister Debbie give this testimony. I don't know all the details, but there were a number of things and v various tests that she's had recently. And one of them was her liver. And her liver was had a very very high count, very high count, 150ome, I believe, orund right up around 150. and and from the one test to the next test, it went down 90 points. And that was supernatural. So, Sister Debbie, we're going to talk about victories and we're going to thank God. It's one thing to have requests and have prayers. It's the next thing to say, "He's done something for me." And we're going to give him all the glory. &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, we went to a doctor." That's your That's irrelevant. Doctors don't heal. God heals. Hallelujah. Isn't that the right? Isn't that the truth? &gt;&gt; And you certainly can clap, Brother Gonzalez. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Ricardo, Sister Buffy. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cancer's gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I read another testimony this morning which I just read. Some of you people are visiting this morning. A brother's in a serious car accident just a few months ago in Switzerland. He's from Germany and they put a pin in his leg and his leg was short, substantially short. I think about 2.9 cm or something and God healed him instantly and his leg is exactly the same length as the other one. And he just said, "I don't know how that rod lengthened, but it's the same length." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We give all the glory to our Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. You are my everything. Lead it out for us. You are all lifted up. Everything both great and small. He gave himself for me. Everything. He is my everything. My will. &gt;&gt; I'd like to hear everyone now. &gt;&gt; He is my everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is my Lord. He &gt;&gt; is my everything. both great and small. He did himself for me. He is my everything. Let's just tell him about it. &gt;&gt; Oh lovely Lord Jesus, you are our everything. Not only for those that are gathered here within the sanctuary and within this building, but those that are streaming and there are many of them from the different countries, whether it be Germany or Switzerland or Norway or New Zealand or over in Singapore. Lord, how we love the people and they write in and encourage us. We bless them in the name of Jesus Christ. We have them join with us and not only in song, but now as we turn to the word. And we are lovers of your word. Lord, we love your word. We love this message. You sent it to us. You called us to it. You called us by it. And now we just pray that you'll bless this group of people that are here. How I thank you for each one of them. Y Let your bride, the bride of Jesus Christ, which your word has declared through the mighty Apostle Paul, it's one bread. We are one bread. Hallelujah. We are one bread. And we will profess that and claim that. Oh God, not only within this building, but the bride of Jesus Christ, wherever they are gathered, we give testimony that the bride of Jesus Christ is one bread. Glory to God. And we've been called under a ministry as your prophet has declared his ministry was to bring the people together. Father, I just pray in the name of Jesus Christ, there'll be such a baptism of the Holy Spirit and a refilling of the Holy Ghost and a rededication and a commitment, oh God, such as we've never experienced. We thank you, Father. Now, come and let your word be spoken as you would have it spoken. In Jesus' name we ask it and for his glory alone we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll have you turn in your Bible, please, to John the first chapter. And we'll read from verse one to verse four. A very familiar chapter and very familiar verses. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And without him was not was not anything made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of man. Amen. You may be seated. I really appreciate you giving me your all and full attention and have just as little movement as possible. so it doesn't distract others. Sometimes we have something on our heart that is uh really ponderous and I think perhaps this is perhaps ponderous. I'm going to pray that God will give you mature spiritual minds. I just don't know how deep I'm going to go and it'll largely depend on on the congregation. And so I just pray that God will help us. Um, and I'm going to read give a couple quotes and then make some statements. In the message, the Palmer worm, a locust, locust and cankerworm caterpillar. Brother Brandham said, "The church was established on the day of Pentecost. Peter preached the inauguration sermon at the baloreate service when the church was born. And if God is infinite, infinite and cannot change &gt;&gt; his church must remain as it was at the beginning. &gt;&gt; And he said, do you admit that &gt;&gt; the church must ever remain the same as it was? But he said, "But man has," and notice closely, "Man has tinkered with it." Put their own interpretation in it. He says, "Don't you never try to interpret the word of God. &gt;&gt; Say just what it says &gt;&gt; and don't care how it is." &gt;&gt; You just line up with it. That's all. &gt;&gt; Don't change the word. The Bible said that the scripture is not of any private interpretation. We have no right to say these things. We just got to read it and say it just exactly like it says and believe it the same way. &gt;&gt; I don't care how ridiculous it seems. Believe it anyhow. &gt;&gt; And the me in the message but from the beginning it was not so. He said, "And he he does not change." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Though men may try to change the word, &gt;&gt; they may try to change the word, but he is the unchangeable God that said it that said it wasn't so from the beginning. The two trees in Eden, we know there were two trees. The one is the tree of life and the other is the tree of knowledge of good and evil. One was Christ and one was Satan. Well, we don't. You might be visiting. You don't understand that. Just believe it. &gt;&gt; There were two trees. &gt;&gt; The two trees appear in the middle of the Bible also. When uh Satan approached Jesus, those are the same two trees. And there they are, the two of them. In Matthew, I think the fourth chapter, it says uh in Ephesians church age, we start with the fact that there were two trees in the midst of the garden. The tree of life was Jesus and the other tree is definitely Satan. &gt;&gt; It has to be because one produced death &gt;&gt; and one produced life. &gt;&gt; That's just simple. &gt;&gt; That's a simple person. We don't have to try to figure things out. And because of what came forth of the fruit of that tree, we know it was of Satan because of the fruit of the tree. And he says, "Now then we know that both of those trees had a relationship with man or they would never have been placed there." &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly. They must have had a part in the sovereign plan and purpose of God in their relationship to mankind and to himself or we would never we could never impute omniscience unto God. This is all true so far, is it not? Now he says, "The word most definitely sets forth that before the foundation of the earth, the purpose of God was to share his eternal life with man." So in spite of the tree of knowledge and in spite of death being right accessible in the in the Garden of Eden, yet God's plan and program was to share his eternal life &gt;&gt; with man. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the scripture says, "In him was life." In him was life. Didn't say it was anywhere else, but in him was life. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says, "Faith, life is the healer and life is God." &gt;&gt; Another message, the absolute life is the greatest treasure that man can have. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now friends, everyone here, everyone on the internet or all who will ever hear this, we're only here for a very short time. &gt;&gt; And I have a very uh heavy message in in a sense of the word. I want to speak on the supreme importance of maintaining the absolute integrity of the word of God. the supreme importance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of maintaining the absolute integrity, &gt;&gt; the truth, the truthfulness, &gt;&gt; the integrity &gt;&gt; of the word of God. &gt;&gt; God is duty bound. &gt;&gt; He's duty bound to vindicate or to prove his word. &gt;&gt; If it's his word, he's duty bound. Would we agree to that? &gt;&gt; Amen. He's duty bound to prove it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And once he has proved it, &gt;&gt; you and I are duty bound to believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even though we may never understand it, &gt;&gt; we may not even understand how or why God vindicates or proves that word. But once he proves it, &gt;&gt; we're duty bound. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in all likelihood, we will not be able to figure it out. &gt;&gt; We may ponder it. We'll be filled with questions, but we're duty bound to believe it and at least confess and say, "That is God." &gt;&gt; That presence is God. &gt;&gt; I don't have to conjure it up in my mind. I don't have to imagine it. He has just made it abundantly clear that this is God. It's God because it's supernatural and no man could do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not hit and miss. &gt;&gt; That's where we're going to be going. &gt;&gt; And the doors in the in the doors in a door. &gt;&gt; He said, "But to me, it's still the word of God. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. And he's duty bound to stay by that word." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham is standing in front of the people and he said, "But now I'm saying now this is a public meeting and he's just speaking." He said, and he's and he's got, I believe, a people in front of him and he says, "But now I'm saying that waiting to see if he will give me the anointing." He said, "If he doesn't give the anointing, then there's only one thing I can do, friends, is to apologize that he hasn't met me tonight. And then we'll just lay hands on the sick and pray for them and ask the benediction, make the altar call, and go home. That's all we can do." and that's all I know to do. &gt;&gt; Now, we surely must admire that honesty. &gt;&gt; But he said, "If he does come, &gt;&gt; then I think every each one of you that raised your hands and you wanted to see Christ, I think it's your duty just as soon as this is over to come right down here and kneel down and say, "Lord Jesus, I now surrender myself to you." Amen. &gt;&gt; I think that's reasonable. &gt;&gt; He says, "If I'm a liar, &gt;&gt; he will never vindicate a liar." &gt;&gt; And I don't think there's any mystery about that. &gt;&gt; If I'm a liar, he will never vindicate a liar. &gt;&gt; He will have nothing to do with sin. God won't. But if I've told you the truth, then he's duty bound by his word to prove that it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But if it's the word, then God's duty bound to back that word up and vindicate it and to make it truth because he promised to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to speak about I'm just going to leave that there for a moment. We'll come back. I want to speak on that the accuracy the accuracy of the word. To be accurate is conforming exactly to truth or to the standard without error. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Accuracy is critical in so many areas of our lives and I just want to speak of a few. I always think of whenever I get on a plane, you know, I got a private pilot's license years ago and they make you go through a checklist and you have to check everything and you try out your various instruments and make sure the flaps are working and you look at your instruments and so on so forth. And this is just visual flying by visual. It's not even uh instrument flying, but I've been in the cockpits of those 747s and you see all those instruments all up and down the ceiling and all over the place and I just marvel that anybody has the intelligence to know what they mean. &gt;&gt; I have been in the cockpit of a 747 Singapore Airlines and I walked in cuz a bunch of believers are staff and so I walked in and sat down. Uh pilot got his foot kind of up on the edge there and he got a cup of coffee in his hand and I said kind of nice life. Yeah. He said it's it's good life. Whole thing's on automatic pilot. Well, I'm glad that somebody knows how to wire it right. I I don't know how much confidence I have in it. But you know, whenever I did a did a check on the plane, the one thing you you want to check the fuel and you kick the tires and you walk around the plane. That's the pilot's job. You know, in a car, you don't do that. I don't go around kick my tires. I don't check every last thing. So, you run out of gas, just pull over. But like the like the man said, he said about flying, he wasn't going to go on a plane. He said, "When you're in the car and the car stops, you're there. And if you're in a train and the train stops, he says, there you are. But when you're in a plane and the plane stops, where are you?" You have to be more accurate. &gt;&gt; Don't you agree? You have to have a lot of confidence in that fellow sitting up in the front. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother James. Where'd you just fly from? Tokyo or Argentina. We got a brother that's more in the air, I think, than he's on the ground. But I know that they you would agree with that. You have to be more specific. I don't check all the instruments in the car when I get into you. I just get in, turn the key on, and drive away. And if something happens, get a flat tire. So there it is. You're not so concerned about accuracy in the diagnosis of health or sickness. I was reading about a doctor in the states the other day. I won't go into it as I don't want to spend much time on it. But they said in by using using the wrong antibiotic can actually cause certain infections to even grow more and prolonging your sickness and affecting your family. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with the anti antibiotic. It's the wrong antibiotic &gt;&gt; and can actually prolong the sickness or cause the infection virus to grow. &gt;&gt; Sister Biscll and I just have a nephew and he just arrived home I believe yesterday. Flew him out by airvac in a terrible condition. He's terribly afflicted with sugar diabetes. He has a pump and he's got a stent in his head and all kinds of things and he has been in incredible pain and into unconsciousness and whatever more and they flew him from Dawson Creek to Edmonton last week and we didn't know whether he's going to live or not and mother and family went out wife and another sister went out to be there and and the doctors ers who had been attending him seemed they couldn't get things balanced and and the pain and the sickness is just beyond description. Incredible. Just out of his mind and off balance and everything else. got to a doctor in Edmonton and they just did changed something with the stent and made a couple adjustments and I don't know what all and he got up right away and he was going to make himself something to eat and he's on his way home. He's going home right now. Maybe arrived home. That's what happened. I just read also where another doctor and he said that a man fell down is actually happening. a man fell down and and he went into a seizure and I can't take time with it, but they went into the seizure and uh his I believe his son and his wife was there and they rushed him by ambulance to the hospital and they they diagnosed the case and whatever more and and and said he needs more help than we can give him here. They took him to another help, another hospital, I believe in Kansas City. And uh and this doctor who wrote the article, he said that he he said that one thing troubled him. He asked uh he asked the one member of the family that was there exactly what happened. He asked the other member of the family exactly what happened and he asked him to relate what happened to him. And his story was exactly the same as the others. And they said if he went into a seizure, he wouldn't have remembered all of that. So something is wrong. It's not a seizure. And yet they put him through a CAT scan and said it it must be a seizure because uh because of what they're uh the diagnosis that they had made. And he just had a he said sometimes you have to have a hunch. 50% of it's medicine but 50% of it is you just got to have a a a hunch. The doctor has to have an inner voice. And he said he said it wasn't matching. If he had a seizure, he wouldn't remember it. His story would have been different than the other two. And he said, "I want to have another CAT scan. Only this time, I want to have a CAT scan of his chest, not his head." And even the nurses said, "Doctor, he just had a CAT scan. He just had a CAT scan and and and and it and it shows that he's not having a a bleed in his head." He said, "I want another CAT scan." He said they just had one. They had a a discussion over it. Sounded like it had even dissension amongst the medical team. He said, "I want another cat scan. I want it of his chest. Something's not sounding right. If there's anything wrong with his brain, he wouldn't have remembered. I want another CAT scan." And a main artery had had broke in him. Had broke and ruptured. And they found exactly what was wrong. He said he only had 50/50 chance to live right then. They operated immediately and and and fix that artery and whatever was necessary and the man continued to live and was perfectly healthy. So he was just talking about the right diagnosis. We've had brother Otto I've talked to brother Otto many times and he said the medical profession today doesn't have time doesn't have the time because of the pressure and the and the pressure on the time for the doctors and medical people don't have time he said I have spent four and five hours to get the right diagnosis and he just simply said in his in his precise German way how can you give the right uh antibiotic or how can you give the right uh the right response if you don't know what the problem is. You've got to know what the problem is. My point is when you're sick, you're afflicted. You want accuracy. &gt;&gt; And you want a doctor who knows what he's doing and knows what he's saying. You want accuracy. That's just in life. &gt;&gt; You want accuracy. &gt;&gt; You're determined. Well, maybe he doesn't know. I want a second opinion. I want to go to a specialist because you want accuracy. &gt;&gt; We just have and we could talk about accuracy and prescription. We talk about accuracy. They just had the world Olympics are on and the first gold medal that was won I understand was won by a a Chinese young lady and and she was a sharpshooter and she got a 10.5 out of a possible 11 and won the first gold medal. She was and and and all of the athletes are there. They're there for accuracy. They're there for stamina. They're there to uh to uphold their nation. They're not there to slough off. Right. &gt;&gt; They're not there to take this thing casual. &gt;&gt; There's nobody over there in London taking this week casual. &gt;&gt; They have spent years getting ready and practicing to be accurate &gt;&gt; with everything that they do. Is that not right? &gt;&gt; I want to say something. I am speechless and dumbfounded at how casual people want to be with the word of God &gt;&gt; and eternal life. &gt;&gt; Well, that's what they said. That's what my church is. That's what this church does. Who gives a care what somebody else does? what another doctor does or another preacher does or something else. &gt;&gt; Let's find out. Say, well, God, uh, if there is a word of God, &gt;&gt; it's up to you to prove who it is. &gt;&gt; And you're supernatural, so it's not going to be some natural reasoning that we got to figure out. I don't have to figure it out. You figured it out. &gt;&gt; I'm not obliged to send it or produce it. Right? &gt;&gt; It's your word. &gt;&gt; You want to share eternal life with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is that word? &gt;&gt; And then what are we going to do with it when he does present it and say, "Here it is." &gt;&gt; Now you see where I'm going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To sin. The word sin in the Bible simply means to miss the mark. To miss the way or to go the wrong way or to miss the goal. You don't have to miss it by six feet. You don't have to miss it by three feet. You don't have to miss it by you just miss it by an inch or two. &gt;&gt; And a miss is a miss. That's right. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says in things that wasn't so from the beginning. He said their churches is gone today. They're off on a tantrum somewhere. Making organizations, making denominations, bringing people after creeds instead of after Christ. Says, "I don't want no creed but Christ, no law but love, and no book but the Bible." That's exactly what we've got. God's creed. &gt;&gt; It's God's prescription. &gt;&gt; I'm glad it's an accurate prescription. &gt;&gt; I'm glad that God knew what sin needed and gave exactly what it needed. &gt;&gt; And sin was simply going off of the word, tampering with the word. &gt;&gt; That's what he did. He tampered with the word &gt;&gt; and got Eve to accept a tampered word &gt;&gt; and all of death happened. You'll never figure out how come every hospital bed, every prison cell, every insane institution, every drug addict, everything else, it's been produced by that one. We can't understand it. God understands it. &gt;&gt; And because he understands it, he's given the he's given the antidote for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's given the solution for it. He's given the prescription for it. Does everyone agree with that? &gt;&gt; I'm giving it in short statements today. But I hope that when I'm done, there isn't very much room to move. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's God's creed and it's God's prescription. It's God's antidote for sin. It's God's antidote for our healing. And it's God's power made manifest to us as we take the word in our lives. It's God's power made manifest &gt;&gt; to us as we take the word in our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said Peter, James, and John hit the mark every time because they followed the word. &gt;&gt; Said they didn't hit the mark every time because they understood the word. They hit the mark every time because they followed the word. &gt;&gt; So we're called on some sometimes to follow something we don't understand. I don't know exactly why I'm doing this. I only know that it is God and I know that it works &gt;&gt; in the message key to the key to the door. He said Hebrews 12. He's referring to Hebrews 12. Seeing that we're compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and the unbelief and the unbelief that does so easily set us. The sin that does so easily beset us. Which sin, he said, is unbelief. Only one sin. That's unbelief. And sin means miss the mark. Like you're shooting, you miss the mark. Better adjust your gun because there's something wrong. You missed the mark. See, he says, "Come back and try over." See, it means to turn around. You've missed the mark. And when you want to be a Christian and you join a church, you've missed the mark. When you want to be a Christian and you've been sprinkled in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, you've missed the mark. Better come back. You'll not be on the target. If this says in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, repent, not just be baptized, repent and be baptized. Turn around and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. The preacher doesn't give it to you. The water doesn't give it to you. No one else, no, no, no amount of emotion gives it to you. You shall receive it. That's the prescription &gt;&gt; and that's what you need to believe. A lot of people I think they only believe that I will go to the water and be baptized. That isn't where the believing ends. That's just where it starts. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So there's only one way. &gt;&gt; However, people, you know, tend to lean to their own understanding. He says, "Brother Brandham talks about dreams. I've heard a lot of people. I've had dreams. Most people have dreams. Good ones, bad ones. Some that mean something. Some that are just total nonsense. Some that are full of hookie spooks. And some of them that need interpretation and bio. She never gets some wild interpretations." Uh, and the prophet says God can deal in dreams, but it's not too accurate. &gt;&gt; So, let's not put a whole lot of emphasis on on the dreams. &gt;&gt; So, now I'm speaking on the maintaining and the believing in the accuracy now of the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm accuracy of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Maintaining &gt;&gt; maintaining the accuracy, maintaining the belief in the accuracy accuracy to obtain the prize, not a gold medal at the Olympics. You might take this with a grain of salt, but I don't want you to. I can I can tell you that the Olympians that are in London have nothing nothing. They're not even in the same ballpark with the people that are sitting right here. &gt;&gt; Not even in the same ballpark. &gt;&gt; And they for uh uh um just some human glory, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And are you going to compare that? We could never compare that with hearing a blessed voice saying, "Enter in &gt;&gt; thou blessed of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Into the things that have been prepared for you from before the foundation of the world. You want a galaxy, here it is. You want eternal life. We're talking about eternal life, friends. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not talking about standing on a podium. &gt;&gt; I'm bronze. I'm silver. I'm gold. &gt;&gt; And I'm not belittling that. They But look how they how they uh strive for how the accuracy and perfection and precision &gt;&gt; in their run and in their step and everything. How much more &gt;&gt; should we concern ourselves about the accuracy of the word of God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You don't mind if I just take my time a little bit? &gt;&gt; I'm conscious about being long- winded, so please help me. God has made himself abundantly clear and left man with no excuse. &gt;&gt; In Romans, we read, "Because that which may be known of God is manifest is Romans 1:19. Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them. For God hath showed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Being understood by the things that are made. We see the things that are made. So we understand that even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse. God is saying through the mighty Apostle Paul that these things are so clear. &gt;&gt; The invisible God has made those things so visible and so manifested that they're without excuse. They're right here in front of them. Now he continues on with that. And the seed, we speak of the seed now in the beginning. The seed life seed is central to the entire Bible. Now I'm starting to get into some fairly heavy things. The seed life is absolutely central to the entire scripture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Every seed after his own kind. So just pay real strict attention. In the beginning we read was the word. The spoken word and this will cover another messages I've tried to convey here but the spoken word is infused or pervaded or permeated with seed life. It's &gt;&gt; number one. And the carrier of that seed even in the animal world has is driven by a compulsion. Must give that seed for the for the procreation of life. And the prophet took back to the animal kingdom and how the animal kingdom amongst the uh animals when they come into season for breeding it it is incredible. You know you take those of you that are acquainted with the animals in this country a moose for example he goes crazy. He'll take on anything in Alaska if you can believe it. a moose when he's when he's in the rut, they call it the rut. When he's in the rut, he'll stand in the middle of the train tracks and take on an engine coming at him at 50 m an hour. And it's a big problem up there because so many of them are killed. But there's something within him. He just he's so supercharged. He He's supercharged. Remember now, it's it's life. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is interested only in one thing that is producing another one like himself &gt;&gt; and he's so intent on that he's ready to take on a tree or take on the woods or take on any other animal he meets or take on a train if necessary. That is now that's just in the animal kingdom. Then when that becomes perverted in the human kingdom, then in the end time we end up with a complete perversion &gt;&gt; where men don't want to give the seed to women and women don't want to receive it from the man. &gt;&gt; And for that, come on, folks. &gt;&gt; You're not babies. &gt;&gt; You understand? And that's exactly what the world is. &gt;&gt; And the world's infested with it. &gt;&gt; The world is corrupted with it. &gt;&gt; And that's one of the reasons God's going to destroy it. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said that if God didn't destroy it, he'd have to raise up Sodom and Gomorrah. Who's Sodom and Gomorrah? &gt;&gt; What are the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah? and apologize &gt;&gt; for destroying them because this age has exactly gone full full scale &gt;&gt; the same direction &gt;&gt; and it's tampering with the seed &gt;&gt; and that is only at a natural level &gt;&gt; because that is indicative of what Satan is on the rampage to do with the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; It's the message of the hour that he hates. &gt;&gt; It's the lifegiving seed that he hates. He wants to tamper with it or get anybody with their in their minds or or their philosophy or whatever more and and maybe they're not going right away. So, the message is not of God. Oh, no. The message of God, but it needs to be tingled with. It needs to be tampered with. It needs to be, you know, it needs to be explained. &gt;&gt; We don't have to have it explained. You need to believe it. &gt;&gt; Do I hear an amen on that? &gt;&gt; And you young people especially the same. You've got minds and you've got retention and you've got energy. And if there is a time yet to remain, there is some future. You're the ones that really need to take a hold of this thing with real fervor and zeal. &gt;&gt; And you should look up what the zeal and the fervor meant in the scripture. It is right exactly comes back to the same thing. It is the passion. &gt;&gt; It's a passion and the zeal &gt;&gt; to bring forth &gt;&gt; after their kind &gt;&gt; because that's the word of God. &gt;&gt; And we're not here just to form another church. There's churches everywhere. We're here to bring forth after our kind. And as long as we're here, there's another one that needs to be brought forth after our kind. That's another word believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's a bornagain son of God, daughter of God, separated from the world to live the expression of Jesus Christ, to carry his seed. and to bring forth another one. &gt;&gt; And we're driven by a zeal, by a fervor, by a passion. &gt;&gt; We're not lukewarm. &gt;&gt; We're not lukewarm. We're not casual about this thing. We want an accurate word and we want it preached accurately. We want the full strength of the word delivered to us. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And it's only that word that has life in it. And this isn't life just to extend life. This isn't healing. This is eternal life. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself upon the earth." And it was so. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the next verse, and the earth brought forth grass. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he said it. &gt;&gt; And it brought forth grass, and the herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit after uh whose seed is in itself, after his kind. That happens to be the text for the spoken words, the original seed. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. And God saw that it was good. &gt;&gt; Christ come forth. The fruit tree came forth. &gt;&gt; And then God said, "Let us make man in our image." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's have one of our kind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; After our likeness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let them have dominion. We have dominion. Let them have dominion &gt;&gt; over the fish, over the sea. I got an email, a text this morning from a brother in Uganda. He's streaming right now. He said he'll be streaming the service. So, we say, "God bless you, brother Bus." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and he just was spoke on a radio broadcast and God opened the door with the uh leader of the Pentecostals and he got on a trinity and uh and the trinitarians and I'm saying this for brother Bus's behalf is right it's easier than for me texting at all but when they say let us the emphasis is on us I say I go with you &gt;&gt; well who is us I don't know do you No. Well, it's a trinity. Oh, is it? That doesn't say so. &gt;&gt; Let us make man. So, I go with them. &gt;&gt; And then I say, did do you agree that they made man in their image when they were done? Did they have one? Did they have their image? &gt;&gt; And they said, "Well, yeah. How many did they have?" Well, now we have a real problem &gt;&gt; because we say, "Well, no. Well, uh, yeah, they only had one." Then it wasn't in their image. &gt;&gt; Wasn't in their image. &gt;&gt; When they had it in their image and they ended up with one &gt;&gt; and yet it was a plurality because in him was his wife. Amen. &gt;&gt; Eve was still in him. &gt;&gt; And he says they called their plural name Adam singular. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when he was finished with his image, he only had one. &gt;&gt; And so God created man in his in his own image. &gt;&gt; In the image of God created he him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Male and female created he them. &gt;&gt; Don't try to figure it out. Just read it. &gt;&gt; And God bless them plural. And God said unto them, plural, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl over the air, and over every living thing that moved upon the earth." Adam hadn't even been put to sleep yet. &gt;&gt; Eve hadn't even come forth yet. &gt;&gt; She wasn't even made till chapter two. And then you get into chapter two and and God hasn't even formed Adam out of the dust of the ground yet. &gt;&gt; Have dominion and control just like the original &gt;&gt; does male and female created he them just like the original. &gt;&gt; The bride was in God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was alone. He was absolutely alone &gt;&gt; and he made one in his own image. &gt;&gt; And the reason why he could say it's it's not Adam who said it's not good for man to be alone. &gt;&gt; No, it's God who said it's not good for man to be alone because he was expressing himself. &gt;&gt; I'll make a helpmate for you. &gt;&gt; And what was the helpmate? Listen now, adults. The helpmate was a place for his seed. &gt;&gt; That was a weak amen. &gt;&gt; It was a place for his seed &gt;&gt; so he could reproduce himself and have another one of his kind. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly why God created you and I. So he could implant his seed in you, pregnantate you and bring forth after his kind. Not after the world, not after a church, not after a denomination, not after any other creed, not even a tradition of the message. His kind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; From this point rises two things. Number one, the determination to bring forth. &gt;&gt; Now, when you read the Old Testament, when you folks read the Old Testament, I guarantee you there's all kinds of it that you don't understand. There were people in the whole nations that were slain and you don't understand that. But I can tell you one thing. There's one thing in the mind of God and that is that he's going to bring forth of his own kind. &gt;&gt; And when anything got in the way that the seed line might get cut, hindered &gt;&gt; or prevented, God moved nations. He moved nations and he eliminated them. &gt;&gt; If they tried to stand withstand Israel and God raised up a people and and and and now you have to help me. &gt;&gt; There's a passion within God where the same God that says we should be zealous, we should be redot, we should be fervent, that's because there's that characteristic of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why that's why Tamar wasn't destroyed when she when she had a husband and couldn't bring forth and then it was to have her her his brother to bring forth and he spilled his seed and God slew him. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he wouldn't bring forth on honor on his brother's head &gt;&gt; and she had something in her. Now it's not only the male but it was a female. the woman there and you even know in the animal kingdom it is so and I'm hesitant to speak these things but nevertheless it is true the animal kingdom is God's kingdom &gt;&gt; and sometimes there's something even within uh within uh uh the the females of of the animals that they're selective &gt;&gt; about who is going to uh which one will be give them a strong cub or a strong offspring And there was something selective in Tamar. She knew she must bring forth the the seed of the lion of the tribe of Judah. &gt;&gt; This tribe must not die. &gt;&gt; And if it means my reputation, it means my reputation. If it means they're going to cut me off even at the threat of being burned at the stake, this seed must not die. Amen. &gt;&gt; And transferred herself from Genesis over into Matthew 1:1 as one of the mothers of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You can never figure that out. Don't try to figure it out. It's God's determination. He must be He must be uh the lion of the tribe of Judah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it caused her even to dress in a as a harlot. &gt;&gt; And to lay with her own father-in-law. You'll never figure that one out. &gt;&gt; And she should have been burned for it. Judas says, "Bring her here and I'll burn her." &gt;&gt; And she had some tokens that he had given her. And &gt;&gt; he said, "This is the man &gt;&gt; that I'm carrying this child with." And she gave him his own items and he just said, "You're more righteous than I am." &gt;&gt; God didn't have her destroyed. Has God got a double standard? No. The standard is the standard is every seed must bring forth after his own kind. And God is the first one that prophesied. He gave a prophecy. &gt;&gt; God actually prophesied. And the prophecy is concerning seed. &gt;&gt; And he comes to the serpent and he says, "I'll put enmity between you and the woman &gt;&gt; and between your seed &gt;&gt; and her seed." &gt;&gt; And her seed was going to be nothing other than the new created seed of almighty God. God was God was speaking and prophesying again that he's going to create a new seed and Jesus Christ would be the beginning of a new creation. Hallelujah. And I say to you today, he transformed himself into spoken word and uttered his word and spoke in this generation. The spoken word is the original seed and has brought forth original children after his kind. And there's a great struggle going on for us to to dilute and to water down and to take away from the emphasis and the importance of it. I resist the spirit of this leisia with everything that's in me. I resist it in the name of Jesus Christ. It is the enemy of God. And I want that this church rise up because this is your time to shine. This is your time to make yourself known. This is your time to be able to tell the world, "We're not just a church. We're sons and daughters of the living God. We've been birthed by the eternal seed of Almighty God. And I refuse to be reduced down to a nominal Christian to a lukewarm generation. Hallelujah. I refuse it in the name of Jesus Christ. And as a servant of Christ today, I say, Satan, you're defeated. Hallelujah. You perverter of the seed of God. You cannot pervert this seed. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He's filled our streets with filth of vile things and you rub shoulders with it every day. I deny it &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. With everything that's in me, I deny it. This perverted spirit will have no part of the message. I'm not talking about the perversion of the flesh. I'm talking about the perversion of the word of God. The evidences of this loss of desire to reproduce in both men and women, loss of natural affection for the offspring. &gt;&gt; Don't be afflicted with that. The sexual perversion of this age all has to do with seed. &gt;&gt; People are talking about sexual orientation. Has nothing to do with that. &gt;&gt; Has to do with the perversion of seed. &gt;&gt; That's right. Men, the scripture says, leave leaving the natural use of the women. And even women did change the natural use into that which is against nature. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, and I'm going to give it very precise. &gt;&gt; It's all in Romans 1. Won't turn to it. Verse 24. and God gave them up. And verse 26, and God gave them up. And verse 28, and God gave them over to a reprobate mind. The only place in the Bible you'll find it like that. &gt;&gt; Doesn't make me happy. Gives me sadness. And God gave them up. &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; gave them up. &gt;&gt; And God gave them up. &gt;&gt; And God gave them over to a reprobate mind. God the fountain of mercy, the m fountain of longsuffering. &gt;&gt; And he gave them up. That spirit which is in the world is only an indication of what that demon wants to do &gt;&gt; with the seed of God, &gt;&gt; the word of God. &gt;&gt; Listen, my friends, this is to put an emphasis on. We haven't just, you know, well, I'm I'm I'm in the message. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just a second. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know what you're talking about? &gt;&gt; You're saying I've got the seed. of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; I've been pregnantated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; However you want to put it. I've been pregnantated &gt;&gt; by God's own instrument. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With the living eternal seed of eternal life into my soul. and I've been given it that I might express my part of him, my allotment that I have been given. &gt;&gt; And that I shall portray Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; in this only chance you have. &gt;&gt; You only got a few short years and you're going to be gone out of here. &gt;&gt; And if God, if the rapture doesn't take place, be laying under some dirt here someplace. So let if this is your time to shine, rise and shine. Hallelujah. For your light has come. &gt;&gt; The seed has been sown. Paul said to Timothy, "Is this all right?" &gt;&gt; If you've never listened, listen this time. I won't preach this again here. without natural affection, put with truth breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce despisers of those that are good &gt;&gt; without natural affection. &gt;&gt; Amen. men and women today. This is so far out of my even my capacity to imagine actually leave their offspring. Not talking about the offspring leaving them. I'm talking about them leave their offspring. &gt;&gt; Just abandon them. Romans again Paul says without understanding covenant breakers without natural affection &gt;&gt; implacable unmerciful the determination of God to keep his lineage going. One of the outstanding places. Is this all right, friends? &gt;&gt; I don't mind if you ship me off to Timbuktu after this service. It'd be fine with me. How's Timbuktu? Somebody knows something about Timbuktu. That's in Molly. You know, sometimes we say things not because we have answers, because we have questions. There's all kinds of questions. I don't figure that I'm going to get all the answers. I just And you don't mind if I tell you about some of the questions because people want to tinker with the message. we if we get this and we just we can fit all of this together and then finally we can consummate in kind of a a doctrine that I love. That's not what the message came for. &gt;&gt; We're not here to tinker with the message. &gt;&gt; We're here to take it as it was unfolded and it was it unfolded. We know it was an everinccreasing revelation. And what is a revelation? It's an unfolding of who? Jesus Christ. And if you don't find Jesus Christ, and I, as I said to the people over in Europe, they end up with some of these specialty doctrines, and by the time you get to the bottom of the doctrine, you find a man there. &gt;&gt; A personality there. That's not the message. Didn't come to raise up personalities. &gt;&gt; Personalities is what corrupted Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm following this person. I'm following this person. I'm following this. There's no great ones in this message. We're just preachers of the gospel declaring the truth of the word. &gt;&gt; And that's where this church stands. &gt;&gt; And I despise I actually despise even the even the thought of the concept, well, brother Ed Bisl this or brother Ed Bisl that or or whoever else. &gt;&gt; We have nothing to do with that. &gt;&gt; That's not what this is all about. &gt;&gt; We're here just for a short time and then we're going to leave. we're going to be dispensed with. And if time goes on, many of you folks will be gone. And some of these younger ones and those that are just children in BCA, they're going to take positions. They're going to be deacons and trustees and whatever more. &gt;&gt; The mission and the vision will still be the same vision. &gt;&gt; It has to be. &gt;&gt; I'm really laying it on you young men and you young ladies. tell you what, you've got a huge mission, &gt;&gt; a huge call, &gt;&gt; this is not something that is supposed to atrophy &gt;&gt; and diminish down into just some kind of social churchgoing thing. I abhore that. &gt;&gt; I came out of that. I was delivered from that. I'm not going to give up this flame and fire. I was born in the fire and I can't stand the smoke, &gt;&gt; if you know what I mean. Now we read about Samson and Delilah and Samson and the different women and everybody figured out Hollywood got their idea about it just is rotten and corrupted. They couldn't think straight if they tried. They couldn't get a picture and a count and they always like to they go to the Bible to get a spiritual side because they know it appeals to a lot of people and then a lot of ignorant people out there and they get kind of their emotion. Isn't that wonderful? You know the passion of Jesus. No, they don't nothing but the passion of Jesus. &gt;&gt; I might be hurting somebody's feelings. They might be saying, "Well, well, I saw it and I was hurt. I I I was moved. I I don't know that I cried. Maybe you did. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean a thing to me. &gt;&gt; He gave his life blood. &gt;&gt; A bride came out of him. Hollywood knows nothing about that. &gt;&gt; Seed life came out of him &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit fell upon a church and we were born again by the spirit of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Samson went down to the Philistines and he saw a woman of Timnath and he liked her. She pleased him. And he goes to his mother and father and says, "This girl down here, I like her. Get her for me." And they were distraught. &gt;&gt; What are you saying? Is there no Is there no young women in Israel? &gt;&gt; You have to go to the Philistines, our enemies. &gt;&gt; He says, "But I, you know, she pleases me. Get her for me." And the Bible says, your Bible says, now this is where you really need to be adult. Your Bible says that his mother and father did not understand that it was of God. &gt;&gt; For God, not Samson, loving a woman. God sought an occasion and go and click on occasion and you'll find out in the meaning of the occasion. God was in the heat, in the compulsion of continuing to bring forth his seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Philistines were a prime enemy and target against it. &gt;&gt; And God was seeking an opportunity to bring destruction to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it even has a sexual connotation as as as uh a as an animal or as a human or as a person in the heat. &gt;&gt; To bring forth &gt;&gt; God was going to bring forth. &gt;&gt; He didn't care about Philistines. &gt;&gt; He didn't care about Hitler. &gt;&gt; He doesn't care about any of these that try to What? What do you think the demon is that possessed Mr. Hitler? It's seed. &gt;&gt; Why do you think Herod had the children? All the male children. Seed. &gt;&gt; Why did Pharaoh want to destroy the male children? It's seed. It's the same demon that was in the beginning. And God will not allow that spirit to overcome. He's going to bring forth his children. And in the midst of this age, you were seated in the most darkened, most confused, most perverted age of all the ages. And God God concluded, I'm not going to send a reformer. I'm going to send a prophet. I'm going to vindicate him. &gt;&gt; And the accuracy will be perfection. There will not be a single time that he will error. Yeah. Just say, did he say it this way or did he say it that way? And he said 700 and he meant 10 7,000. Oh, nonsense. That doesn't change the truth of the word. The purpose of the message is to reveal Jesus Christ in the scripture. The scripture doesn't change. &gt;&gt; The man was a human. &gt;&gt; He got weary like we did. He got hungry like you do. He got tired like we did. So did Jesus. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Tell you what, I &gt;&gt; I am I'm burning up, friends. &gt;&gt; I got an incredible zeal. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And I have to deliver this to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the passion of almighty God. I can say with Apostle Paul, I'm jealous over you. It's with a godly jealousy. We have no natural thing that we're interested in. Not interested in your money. Not interested in your homes. Not in We're interested in your soul. I have a godly jealousy over your soul. And I want to announce to Satan and all the demons and hordes of hell, they shall have no part of the bloodbought throne. They shall have no part of these that have been birthed as sons and daughters of God. You have not been introduced to a church. You've been introduced into the body of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. the chosen elected bride of Jesus Christ, chosen to bear his seed, &gt;&gt; chosen to bring forth of his likeness, &gt;&gt; his image, &gt;&gt; and the gentile bride will bring forth the son of David, &gt;&gt; into the millennium, Through the dark ages, the martyrs that gave their lives, it was to see that the word seed of God would be passed on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, uh, can I have a few more minutes? I mean, &gt;&gt; I need a little more time. I'm quoting. He said in Abraham and his seed, he said, this one, he's speaking about this one, Elohim, that stayed back behind to the elected church. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, Abraham, where's your wife Sarah? How did he know that he had? He said that he was a stranger. Now watch. He's talking to the elected seed now of Abraham. &gt;&gt; He's talking to the elected seed. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, I'm bypassing centuries. This one that stood with Abraham is here this morning talking to you. &gt;&gt; Not me, him. &gt;&gt; I don't even know your individual situation. He does. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he was when he was talking to Abraham and probably saying he was talking to his elected seed. &gt;&gt; He's trying to tell you this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That was me back there and that's me here. &gt;&gt; And if you could believe that &gt;&gt; I confess to you, I have a hard time. &gt;&gt; I have a difficult time. And I'm also challenged at times. Do you believe exactly what he said? &gt;&gt; And I and and I'm not talking about doctrine now. I'm talking about him producing forth &gt;&gt; and saying this one is here at the platform. &gt;&gt; And friends, if I'm going to believe the message and believe everything that prophet of God said, you have to believe. And I have to believe that that same one, that same angel that was in the burning bush and stood before Moses, that same one that stood over the Holy of Holies in the Old Testament, that same one that was none other than the spirit of Jesus Christ, that same one that spoke to Paul on the road to Damascus all the way through, that's the same one that was with William Brandom was photographed. And that same one is still here right now. I am not saying that as some words to excite you. I'm saying that that is the truth of this word and we must not water it down. We must not well don't get casual with it. &gt;&gt; I'm urging you to become believers, strong believers. You say, "Well, that tends towards fanaticism." Then go there. &gt;&gt; Go there. I'll be a fanatic if I need to, but that's what I believe. I cannot water it down. I cannot diminish it. &gt;&gt; That same Jesus that stood there creating bread is the same one walking in this aisle today. The same one speaking to your heart. I know he's speaking to your heart. &gt;&gt; Speaking to the elected seed. like there was in the days of Jesus. When the light flashes, that seed will come to life like that. &gt;&gt; They'll know it. They'll it'll understand it, and it won't have to say a word about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation 22:17 said, "And the spirit and the bride say, "Come." The spirit and the bride say the same thing, and it is come. And let him that heareth say, "Come." Do you hear? I say come. I'm going to say what the spirit says. &gt;&gt; Spirit of Jesus Christ, come. &gt;&gt; And he that is a thirst, let him come. &gt;&gt; And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. &gt;&gt; Whoever heareth my voice today, let him be transformed from a nominal casual Christian into a Holy Ghost burning flame. In this hour of darkness, this is your time. I felt so impressed yesterday. This is your hour. Shine. Rise and shine. While others are dimming out. It's time for you to shine. Others say, "Well, we can do this. Well, we're just having a social nonsense. I don't want anything to do with that social thing. I turn aside from it. I announce to you, this is not merely a church." &gt;&gt; We say CBW. That's just the name of a building. Has nothing to do. This is the church. God's not interested in these lights or all this sound equipment. He's not interested in that. He's interested in you as an individual. And that's all he's interested in. You are his own seed. You're his own elected seed. You're his own son and his own daughter. You think he's going to leave that? He who said without natural affection, you think he's going to leave those without spiritual affection. You're spiritually connected to him. &gt;&gt; You came out of his loins. &gt;&gt; Believe it. &gt;&gt; You young people that have heard it and you've heard it in your church. This isn't this isn't even the message that you've heard at home. &gt;&gt; You haven't even picked it up the way it really is. &gt;&gt; Meet the author. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You'll be changed forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Won't take much. And I'm going to do a dance up here &gt;&gt; because I'm so happy about it. &gt;&gt; For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book. If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book. I have a ways to go. Say, hang on, friends. &gt;&gt; And if any man shall take away from the words of this book, of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. See, it's not just down here. It's over there in the holy city. This is your eternal. We're not here for the accuracy of uh you know, did you miss going to Sunday school? So on and so that's fine. That may be fine. That's just down here. We're not interested in that kind of accuracy. We're interested in hitting the mark. &gt;&gt; The prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus, eternal life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. He which testifith these things saith, surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so come, Lord Jesus, and the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The accuracy of the scripture. Now I I must I must I cannot end this service without coming to the accuracy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of the vindication. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we've driven the nail, but now we're going to clinch it &gt;&gt; so that nobody can pull it out. Nobody can go out this door and pull it out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. First of all, he says in Leodysian church age, first of all, that messenger is going to be a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will have he will have the office of a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He will have the prophetic ministry. &gt;&gt; It will be based solidly on the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because when he prophesies or has a vision, it will always be word oriented. &gt;&gt; Amen. and will always come to pass. &gt;&gt; He will be vindicated as a prophet &gt;&gt; because of his accuracy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You might say, well, &gt;&gt; and I I know I know I know of many. Well, I've been on the internet and there's all kinds of people that found all kinds of things wrong with brother Brandham's message. Well, go on the internet and find how many found things wrong with Jesus message. &gt;&gt; He said the proof that he is a prophet is found in Revelation 10:7. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the proof of it. &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared it to his servants, the prophets. &gt;&gt; Who else has said, "Thus says the Lord, the church doesn't go through the tribulation." &gt;&gt; Who else has said that how the rapture and the change of the body and the change of these Adams? Who said that &gt;&gt; in those words? Amen. &gt;&gt; Who has said that this message is the power to transform? &gt;&gt; And do we see it? We do see it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look what you got out there. If you don't think you have it, go and attend some of these churches. Help yourself. &gt;&gt; Help yourself. &gt;&gt; To all the show and the Hollywood and the presentations and all these things. To me, it's just a it's a sham. &gt;&gt; When I say it to the world, I'm saying to the church, it's a sham. and to preach a trinitarian doctrine when it's not in the Bible, &gt;&gt; not in the word of God. Can't find the trinity in the word of God and baptizing people in titles when there is no such a thing in all of the scripture. And everyone that was in the book of Acts was baptized in the name of the Lord. In the name of Jesus, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And the same people, even ministers, shame on you, &gt;&gt; refuse to go to the water and be baptized in the precious name of Jesus Christ. What a shame. &gt;&gt; And you &gt;&gt; you see it. Say, "Well, I don't understand." You see it. &gt;&gt; You've been brought up in it. &gt;&gt; You've been elected of God to hear it. &gt;&gt; Not because you're some special person. You were born into a special family. God did that &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. God brought you into &gt;&gt; the Lord. &gt;&gt; He says, "I believe the Bible is accurate." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus completely authenticated the Old Testament &gt;&gt; when he was here on earth and it was compiled exactly &gt;&gt; as was our New Testament. &gt;&gt; Makes no mistake about it. We have the infallible word of God today and no man dares take from it or add to it. But we need the same spirit that gave it to teach it to us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "If you're here tonight and thus sayith the Lord, the spirit of God that's within me, I tell the truth, I lie not." The very thing that vindicates it is is a returning of that prophetic spirit. The very thing that vindicates it is the returning of that prophetic spirit. It's the prophetic spirit that did the vindicating because it's God's spirit. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I hope you don't think I'm off the my rocker. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I am, I'll just say, "Leave me that way." &gt;&gt; Amen. He said that discerns the thoughts, tells you what you have done, what you will do, what will happen to you, every predicament, every time perfectly &gt;&gt; for year after year. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want everybody under 25 to say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody under 25. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody over 25. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. year after year after year with perfection, vindication. Absolutely everything was true. What is it that is true? The spirit of prophecy fulfilling the prophecy. In that day, the mystery will be revealed. It's no mystery who the messenger is. &gt;&gt; One of you young people in school, this is a class you'll never get in school. All honors to brother Mr. Tatch and his wife, Sister Shelley, and all the teachers that are here. Maybe you'll take up some of this and incorporate it. &gt;&gt; Every predicament year after year, he says, "That's the vindication &gt;&gt; that I have told you the truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The truth. Yes. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now we've come down to you actually have heard the truth. &gt;&gt; Not only that, you've heard God prove its truth. &gt;&gt; Now, with all of that, I say, what have you done with the truth? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Have you taken it as serious as your diet? &gt;&gt; Have you taken it as serious as your profession? or accuracy when you that are measuring a board or you that are cutting something and I know brother Sam Walner I worked with him he's a perfectionist &gt;&gt; I said that tile looks good enough it just fits in no I said it's not good enough tear it up again have to tear that up oh I hate doing that we work so hard putting down no we got to put it in use all the strength and I just lean against him because he's the man with the muscles Got it all laid in there. Yeah, now that's good. Okay. Yeah, that's right. We're perfectionist, brother Sam. I said we're perfectionist. I was heavy on where we're where. We we I and you &gt;&gt; and we have that kind of accuracy to lay a floor, &gt;&gt; that kind of accuracy to cut a board and get it on the 45, Brother Nathan, or on some other angle. No, there's a spacer 16 of inch. That's no good. Cut it again. What do we do? Waste that whole board. Yeah, we got to cut it again. Going to go shooting. I went shooting with brother Brandham. I said I went out to an old elder who old elder brother. He was elder in our church. We knew nothing about the message. We'd heard that there were some tapes and we were in some brother Brandham's meetings and so on, but there was no messages such yet. And it was our first hunt. So just before we were getting ready to go, I said, "Brother Van, think you'd like to try your gun out and, you know, see how shooting?" Yeah. He said, "I think that'd be good, good idea." So went out to Brother Haney's farm and he got sitting down beside this little log building, you know, the logs come out on the ends and so he could rest his gun there. And and we got a big old piece of cardboard and drew some circles on it and had it about 100 120 yards away. And uh and he had shells in this and shells in this. I'd never been with the person, you know, he knew how many grains were in this shell and how many grains were in that shell and and you know how many grains of powder and you know what kind of powder it was and I just you know I never heard of all that scientific stuff before. But then he he he got down there and he said, "Now this should be about a half inch high at at 1:00." can do. We all run over there and there it was. And then he said, "Now this should be probably 2 in high at 12:00." Boom. There it was. And he kept firing. I I finally quit going. I just quit going. I I knew that's where it was. After about three times, I quit running down there. And uh when it was all over, he said, "Uh, would you like to try a shot, Brother Eddie?" And I thought, "Yeah, maybe I should." Cuz when we went out, you know, we'd just throw a gun in the backseat of the car, the truck, and and along the way, we'd find a tin can in the off in the ditch someplace and just shooting if we're anywhere near the tin can. Good enough for us. So he says, "Would you like to try a shot, brother?" I Yeah, probably I should. So I sat down. Now he says, "Now, how how do you like to shoot?" "Well, I like to pull the trigger." And he he was he was checking for the wind, you know. And wow, it's almost like shooting with a wind wind sock, you know. And so I I I got lined up with my gun. And he said, "Now, brother Eddie," he said, "If you breathe, you breathe twice, you know, and on the second breath, you just breathe breathe out like that. On the second breath, just stop halfway." And he says, "That's when your heart kind of misses a misses a beat or something and you're dead still and fire." Then said, "Okay." you know, I'm going to try that. And so anyway, I I did my best and I think I hit the paper just to this big. So I I I didn't I don't think I don't even remember going to see whether I hit it or not. And Brother Brandham said, "Well, well, how do you like to shoot, Brother Eddie?" And I laughed. I said, "Brother Brandom," I said, "If I see a moose, I I throw so much lead in the general direction, he can't get out of it." and he just laughed. Then he knew he was with some northerners. I know a lot of you folks, you can say amen to that. Now, can I conclude with something? It's maybe a little bit humorous, but it's very serious because I'm preaching a great burden about this message. And brother Bram talks about after a messenger comes and then within about three years they denominate. &gt;&gt; What is that? Tamper with the word. &gt;&gt; And he said now this has been going on for 15 years but now it's been going on a lot more than 15 years. And he talks about the messenger coming and then after the messenger comes people take a hold of his life and events and Make a tradition out of it. &gt;&gt; In questions and answers, we read the scripture. When that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away with. He says, "And we do have today &gt;&gt; by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication." &gt;&gt; Don't forget the vindication with divine vindication. &gt;&gt; Science he said about 35 years ago and that's a lot longer now. It goes back to about the 1919 1920. I timed it from where he was was about 1919 1920. He said they could they could only measure in 10,000th of an inch. In that they could make a model T Ford and with 10,000 of an inch piston ring which could give it the terrific speed of about 25 miles an hour. He said, "Did they stop there?" No, they're cutting in their rule. They're cutting in their ruler, their measurement, and measuring closer. Now, he says they can take the same piston in a jet plane and almost drive it 600 m an hour. He says they can even take that 100,000th of an inch and split an atom with it. Are they stopping? No, they're going on. But us, oh well, we're satisfied with what Moody said, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; With what Finny said, &gt;&gt; those men are all right. &gt;&gt; They're Christians, &gt;&gt; brothers. That's in glory. The first time the rule was ever laid across the word of God, how do you measure it tonight? Said Martin Luther, come out and laid across Catholicism and found out that the just shall live by faith. &gt;&gt; John Wesley, he measured to the people a little closer. &gt;&gt; He cut to the ruler in a little closer, sanctification as they called it in them days. And and second work of grace. And look what he done. He introduced holiness to the church. &gt;&gt; Along came Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And measured down to the gifts of the Holy Spirit, speaking with tongues and signs. And let us let us tonight lay the measure of God down and measure the whole word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who's saying it? &gt;&gt; Vindicated prophet. Let's lay it down. He's not saying it to himself. He's saying it to the people. I'm saying the same word to the people. Let us lay the measure down. We're We've been given the whole council of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, it'll You'll never be the same after this service. You'll say, "What am I doing with that message?" &gt;&gt; Amen. used to go out of this meeting saying, "I can never be the same again &gt;&gt; because what I read, I'm going to absorb. I'm going to receive it and it will bring an accurate revelation of Jesus Christ." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many of us you go down the road and in life and maybe your home, your individual life, your home, your family, your financial situation or whatever more may be in in in disarray. I can tell you thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This message has the answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. for every single need because it's Christ who has the answer &gt;&gt; for every need. &gt;&gt; And I realize we have things that maybe seem impossible. Don't let that change your posture. &gt;&gt; Your posture is I am a believer. &gt;&gt; God has sent me this word. &gt;&gt; Live, die, sink, swim. Whether they go out in the world or whether my family does this, if they cast me off, whatever they say, that's irrelevant. This is what I believe. &gt;&gt; This church, this that church, that something down in Arizona or something up in the Arctic or something in Edmonton or something. We're not We're That's not our guide. That's not our standard. It's already been spoken. It's been delivered to us. And Satan wants to tamper with it. &gt;&gt; He wants to tinker with what you believe. And you have to say, "I'm not going to permit you to tinker with this word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Please, please, I'm trying I'm trying to I'm trying to stop. We're satisfied with what these other brothers, Martin Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, whatever more, but the whole word. And the same Holy Ghost that fired the piston back there and brought them out by faith and justification, the same one that gave sanctification, the one that gave the baptism to the Holy Ghost, the same power and the same Holy Ghost can move the church to perfection. And it will do it. &gt;&gt; And I have my confidence. I nail my confidence by faith right there. And it will do it. &gt;&gt; Not me, not these brothers, not you, not anybody else. The word will do it. It's the life that's in the seed. &gt;&gt; It will do it. &gt;&gt; We just have to be obedient to it. And when he speaks to you, and today he is speaking to you and you say, "Yes." &gt;&gt; I say, "Yay." &gt;&gt; I'll say yes to you, Lord. I'm going to absorb that word &gt;&gt; that the accuracy of the word might manifest itself in me &gt;&gt; please do it &gt;&gt; and it will do it to everything that God has promised in his word God will do it &gt;&gt; he says and they're always trying to bring back the old thing back &gt;&gt; listen friends what's all these you know, antique and uh flea markets. It's a good name. So that my fleas can become your fleas. It's the way I got it figured out. Just a transfer of fleas. My old junk can be your junk. And finally, somebody gets tired of the junk and hauls it where it belonged in the garbage in the first place. Go down to be recycled so it can come back and be new junk. always trying to bring it back. And now listen friends, are you tired? &gt;&gt; Can I Can I go just a few minutes and then I'm done? &gt;&gt; And now keep he says, "And now keep the horse and buggy. It's just a relic. It's history. &gt;&gt; It was all right in its day, but it's it's past that day. Shake hands with the preacher." And the day of Billy Billy Sunday, that was the common thing. and they shook hands with him and they lined up to shake hands with the preacher. And that's the first time I understood that phrase, shake hands with the preacher. And he says, "All right, a long time ago." He said, "But that's past. Denomination lived its day out and we're past that now. &gt;&gt; We're in the astronaut age. &gt;&gt; We're in the astronaut age." &gt;&gt; Hello, young people. We're in the astronaut age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what has got the people all turned around. They don't know what to think about these things. They don't know how to get it. &gt;&gt; They don't know what to think about these things. This kind of meetings that he was having the the two worlds. You don't understand. He says, "I'm standing in another world right now." &gt;&gt; He just said it. I was just listening. He says, "I'm in two worlds." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That world, as I was saying to the brothers, I think yesterday, that world doesn't know anything about time. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no yesterday and no tomorrow &gt;&gt; and there's no thousand years ago and a thousand years in the future. It's timeless. &gt;&gt; You can't even understand that. So I can't even understand the dimension he was in. How are we going to understand what he says from that dimension? &gt;&gt; You know what the problem is? I'm going to cut things short. You know what the problem is? And the reason why I'm preaching so with such fervor and zeal is because I see things that perhaps you don't see, but you might live &gt;&gt; beyond my time. I don't know. But don't let yourself ever be reduced to model T technology in the message. &gt;&gt; This is not a model T religion. &gt;&gt; This isn't even an airplane religion. &gt;&gt; This isn't some little rocket religion. This is an astronaut age. And you are here for the simple purpose that this word will have power over your life and over your substance. That you will actually change from this world into another world by the power of this word and by the power of the Holy Spirit that's here right now present &gt;&gt; and of God so will that we could vanish into another world into another place. That's the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as Jesus resurrected, came back and walked with the disciples, &gt;&gt; I expect it, &gt;&gt; I expect, &gt;&gt; the resurrected in Christ, &gt;&gt; to come up alongside of me someday. &gt;&gt; I've watched for it. I've looked for it. &gt;&gt; And you might not even recognize them because they're going to be young, youthful. Maybe not the way you saw them when they left. Jesus saw Mary saw Jesus thought he was a gardener. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I've done this a time or two, but now in the context of this message and I'm closing, we hear everything. We hear so much and you have heard so much. I'm appealing to you that maybe just gone over your head or you know just oh I've heard it so much the word the word the word. No I bring it down right down where you're living. If there is a word of God and he's the author of it, he's under obligation to prove it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And once he has proved it, then we know that that is his word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And once we determine yes and you can go out of this service and you're going to sit in your seat and you're going to have to say yes, &gt;&gt; that is the word because that is perfect vindication. &gt;&gt; And that is supernatural and no human knew that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you must believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that is really is you're really pressing it down, brother Biscll." I am because we're not talking about health or being healed. We're not talking about finances. We're not talking about marital situations being corrected. We're talking about eternal life. &gt;&gt; I want to go on the other side and I want to meet you on the other side. &gt;&gt; And listen, friends, I I examine myself continually. &gt;&gt; God, forgive me. Help me. Help me not to make error. Help me not to go the wrong direction. Help me to have the right attitude. &gt;&gt; Help me. I need help all the time, don't you? &gt;&gt; I don't want to miss the mark. &gt;&gt; So, he has a person. Now, we have what he said. It will be a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll reveal the mystery. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of God in the word. &gt;&gt; Now he's going to reveal the mystery in the lives of not a hundred, not a thousand, thousands. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You could have been there. It so happened it was another woman that was there. He says, "You're shook a little because I'm trying to get you quiet." So the woman was shook and nervous because he's trying to get her quiet for that which is on you now isn't isn't isn't to hurt you. So he's explaining it. It's to help you. It's his presence. &gt;&gt; You're getting dim to me. Why? because he's passing from this realm into another one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're getting dim to me and that's his presence. Number one, you're doing some kind of mercy work. Number two, you are a nurse. Number three, and you suffer with a stomach trouble. Number four, you can't eat. It's a condition of the stomach that's causing you trouble. Number five, and you've got a place that troubles you in your back. Number six, and it was caused by lifting a patient one time and you strained your back. &gt;&gt; Those things are true. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if God is present to say what is true, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; you know whether that's right or not, ever what he told you because he doesn't even know what he told him. &gt;&gt; Ever what he told you is in your is in your back life. &gt;&gt; Will you believe me as his prophet tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, surely everything six things he just told her true. actually more than six. Just told her was true. Surely you wouldn't ask her to believe something that was a lie. &gt;&gt; So now will you believe me as this prophet? &gt;&gt; Tonight you're healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can go. God bless you &gt;&gt; for I see you in the time after. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're healed. &gt;&gt; I saw you before. I saw you. I see what you're doing. I see what kind of profession you have. You've lifted a patient. You've strained your back. All of these things. That's what you're here for. And now I see you after. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the kind of God I want to serve. &gt;&gt; He sees you when you leave out of here. &gt;&gt; He knows what's going to be this afternoon and when you go home. Isn't he wonderful? Amen. &gt;&gt; That kind of accuracy, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to trust my soul to &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now you may hear in your lifetime or encounter. And with this, I'm closing and I'm going to give you some sound advice. advice that I have used many times and it silences the critics when someone comes and they say, "Well, uh, you know, I've heard all kinds of stuff. February 28th, Brother Brandon was out hog hunting. There wasn't even any uh any uh there wasn't any season open at that one fellow said to me, "Does your prophet hunt out a season?" No, he doesn't hunt out a season. Says, "Well, I know that he wasn't there on that time because of March the March the uh March the 4th, he was down in Texas appealing for that boy who was on death row, appealing for his release, the boy that was on death row so he wouldn't go and be put to death. So he wasn't there on February 28th. I just looked at him. I thought, "You're so ignorant. &gt;&gt; You're so ignorant." &gt;&gt; I lived in the north. I I I worked Wednesday morning in my wife's dad's store and it closed Wednesday afternoon. Wednesday afternoon, I just borrowed a gun. I didn't even own a gun. And I just borrowed a gun, threw it in the backseat of the car, and went out and got my first deer. And I was back for supper. And here's a guy trying to tell me. Well, he couldn't have been there February 24th because he went down there and in March he was down in Texas. And then he came back and he said, "I was hunting with the brothers after I came back." Well, that's fine. There's no mystery. I could be hunting with the brothers and say after I come back, you know. So, I went out. It didn't take me a whole day. Didn't take me three, four days. I just went out in the afternoon and got a deer. I went out in the afternoon little two three weeks later and shot a moose and was back the same night &gt;&gt; back home and got up the next morning went to work. He says, "Well, it couldn't have been that. We're not here to try to satisfy critics." &gt;&gt; And when I hear one, I just say this, and here's my conclusion. When you produce the kind of vindication &gt;&gt; that followed this message, you come back to me when you have that vindication. And then I will listen to you. &gt;&gt; Until then, you have nothing to say. You have nothing to offer. And furthermore, I don't want to hear anything from you. &gt;&gt; And you know what? They don't come back. &gt;&gt; Why don't they come back? Cuz I haven't got the vindication. I want the kind of indication that says you're you're working in mercy. &gt;&gt; You're a mercy worker. &gt;&gt; You're a nurse. &gt;&gt; And you got a back stomach trouble and you can't eat and this is your problem. But they have another problem. I like I like the one that says he says uh I see another woman beside you. Another woman. It's your sister. No, it's your sister-in-law. That's the kind of indication I have. &gt;&gt; Until those critics come back with that, let them go their own way. &gt;&gt; And they'll be damned by it &gt;&gt; because they're following a lie. &gt;&gt; They're following the same one who told the lie in Eden. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Is that too strong? &gt;&gt; No. That's what you want to hear. &gt;&gt; You want to hear it because you're elected seed. &gt;&gt; Why you want to hear it? Amen. &gt;&gt; And I didn't preach this morning just to make people feel good. Even though I feel wonderful, &gt;&gt; I spoke that you might be uh further uh uh s such an affirmation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and that I would like to see within this congregation a commitment &gt;&gt; far beyond what we have. &gt;&gt; So I'm going to be more attentive. I'm going to be more fanatical. I'm going to be more supportive. I'm going to support this work. I'm going to support the mission. going to support the ministry. I'm going to be there with my presence. I'm going to support the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the young man is sitting listening to me right now that last Sunday I appreciated very much and he will forgive me if when I repeat this but he met me because he wanted to say something. said, "Brother Biscoll, I I used to be in involved quite a bit and and the things everything was happening, you know, in the church. I wanted to make myself available. I wanted to He said, and I kind of laid the vision down, but he said, I'm not fulfilled and I'm picking it up again. &gt;&gt; And I wanted you to know what can I do &gt;&gt; you? Whatever my talents, whatever I can do for God, that's what I want to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say, God bless that attitude. &gt;&gt; That's the way we all want to be. Just do what we can do for the body of Jesus Christ. This is our only only opportunity to run and we're going to run it with everything that's in us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's have the musicians. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What should we sing? I had a one or two written down here. Let's sing. Uh, I'm amazed &gt;&gt; that he loved me. All right. Would you stand with me, please? Can we say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; I hope that there's a sense within you. Don't Don't go back just to the same level. Just say, "I heard something. I want to reach out to it. I want to reach out to a whole new level of energy, a whole new call. Friends, preachers don't preach for their own health or just to make people happy. That's not it. And let's not have this service end just as another service. Say, God, what is it that you're saying to me? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you want prayer, there's brothers here to pray for you. You don't even have to come forward. You can have it right there where you're at. And it's not an alter call. We're not having an altar call. I just want people I I take you as a real mature congregation. But I want to nail I want to nail shut any possibility for Satan, this slicker, to creep in with his lies. I've heard enough and it just brings a heaviness upon my own soul. And so I'm saying that to you and I think I was very clear this morning, was I not? &gt;&gt; If it's God's word, &gt;&gt; he's duty bound &gt;&gt; to prove it. &gt;&gt; And he does prove it &gt;&gt; with a supernatural &gt;&gt; so that we know whatever you hear of the prophet's message. That's irrelevant &gt;&gt; because you go right back to the vindication say he vindicated it. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, dear friends, I don't know how long I'm going to be around. I don't know how long you're going to be around. One thing's absolutely certain. There's never been a people. There's never been a people. You can just say your name, your age. There's never been a people that has been given such vindication. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That has such a message. &gt;&gt; No one's heard tapes like that. No other generation heard it &gt;&gt; where they could hear hear him uh hear this prophet of God. It's not even his voice. &gt;&gt; He says just it's my voice, but he he's the one who's speaking. Someone else is speaking. No one's ever had that. &gt;&gt; And that this is what's eating me up. &gt;&gt; How anybody comes without even a trace of vindication. You talk about a brazen. That's the same devil that could come to Jesus and say, "It's written." Who's speaking? &gt;&gt; Who's speaking? &gt;&gt; It's written talking to the very word himself. That friend, that same demon, that same spirit is present in the world today &gt;&gt; and ready to talk to you. It's second you'll give an ear to it. &gt;&gt; I say my ear has no room for that stuff &gt;&gt; whatsoever. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm amazed. I'm amazed. I'm amazed. To your precious blood. I found and I see the heart away. Heat. Heat. Heat. I am all wash away. All I see want to turn around and shake hands with another redeemed one. What a joy it is. Glory. What a joy it is. Another redeemed one. God bless you, brother Timothy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is within me. Bless his holy name. Let's sing it together. I just want to worship. We haven't got another meeting tonight. I know the brothers have from Tacoma. God bless you, Brother Daniel. Brother Joseph, so happy to have you. Amen. All the others. Ah, hallelujah. Bless the Lord, oh my soul. All right. Bless my soul and all that is within. Bless his name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and me. Bless his holy name, holy name. For he has done great things. Great things. Yes, he has done great things.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise his holy name. &gt;&gt; Bless God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Thank you for this word, Lord. Thank you for this message. Today I stand behind this pulpit and before these people to declare, Father, my thanksgiving, my worship to you for such accuracy, for a vindication that was perfect. Perfect. Oh God, I just want to give you all the glory. You're just so glorious and so wonderful. Fill our hearts with the splendor of heaven. I pray. Oh God, I pray there will not be one that will be stooped over. I pray not one that will be burdened down, but they will cast their burdens quickly at the feet. Oh, bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. Oh my soul, Father, it is as though we're just ready to ready to enter into that realm. The word is here. The message is here. The Holy Spirit is present. Oh God, cause this congregation &gt;&gt; to be ignited with a flame, &gt;&gt; with a fire &gt;&gt; that will catch the catch the catch others on fire. &gt;&gt; Oh God, stir, I pray, fill with your spirit. &gt;&gt; I pray you'll slay the enemy, oh God, at every point. Make these people to be mighty mighty warriors in a very dark time in a very confused time. You'll give them such stability. Oh God, bless every person. Father, I pray all the difficulties may vanish. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. Oh, glory to God. Glory to God. Glory to God. Bless the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Can I ask you a question in this song? Do you hear them coming, brother, climbing up the steeps of light? Clad and glorious shining garments, bloodwash garments, pure and white. Hallelujah. Join me. Let me hear it all my Oh, glorious shining garments. Watch pure and glorious in the blood of the lamb in the glorious farmer. till we all see the grand blood of the lamb. I am the glorious glory and I am walking in the blood of the lamb and your spirit might go and your spirit might upon Because again, Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I send you from this place with the blessings of the Almighty &gt;&gt; upon you &gt;&gt; and ask you that you'll claim a different life in Christ. You walk out of this place and shine with a light. I felt I felt to tell you it's your time to shine. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to meet many, many people this week and they don't have this light. &gt;&gt; They don't have this hope. They don't have this promise. They don't have this Christ. You shine. You'll just shine with the glory of God. If a woman back in her denominational days, or I don't even know if she was in the denomination, sat and sang here, what was the name of that song? Come up here, Joel. We've got new we we've got new uh microphones also. But uh I wouldn't dare ask my wife to sing it. But you get the get the title. You know, this is an experience. This something God did. &gt;&gt; This something the woman I'm living with, she it was this before we were married. She's just a girl. &gt;&gt; Why wouldn't we give glory to God? &gt;&gt; And in that realm, there wasn't even empty yesterday, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Maybe that woman, the the sound is still there in another realm. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're going to think I went right off my rocker. Tell you what, you just want to listen to that prophet enough times and see the realm that he was in, the world he was in, the realm he was in. That's where I'm headed. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; What was the name of it? &gt;&gt; I'll let you know the words. I won't sing it &gt;&gt; real loud. &gt;&gt; Um I wandered far in sin's dark shame with doubts and fears oppressed. I heard the voice of Jesus say, "Come unto me and rest." Jesus hath saved me. Jesus doth hold me. Faithful and true is he. He Jesus is nearer. Jesus is dearer than the whole wide world to me. &gt;&gt; I'm sure you can't doubt that that impressed a girl's mind. Here we are 60 years later. More than 60 years later, she can tell you exactly what it was. Jesus is nearer. Jesus is dearer. Hallelujah. Go with those blessings. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Thank you for being here today. Love.
