[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] Give ear to my words, oh Lord.
[0:11] Consider
[0:13] my tempation.
[0:19] I cannot do the Lord from my cry.
[0:26] My king
[0:29] and my God.
[0:34] For unto
[0:36] thee shall I praise
[0:41] my voice shall I hear
[0:45] [Music]
[0:53] will I direct my prayer unto thee
[0:59] will
[1:01] I stand and sing these First David here
[1:06] to my word. Oh

[1:30] is my God.
[1:34] For unto
[1:36] me will I pray.
[1:41] My voice shall thou hear in the morning.
[1:49] Morning
[1:52] will I direct my prayer unto thee and
[1:58] will
[2:06] and those are the words of David
[2:10] prophet and the king. He also said in
[2:12] Psalm 5, the same chapter, but as for
[2:16] me, I will come into thy house in the
[2:18] multitude of thy mercy, and in thy fear
[2:21] will I worship toward thy holy temple.
[2:25] Later on, verse 11, he says, "But let
[2:27] all those that put their trust in thee
[2:29] rejoice." Can you rejoice this morning?
[2:33] Let them ever shout for joy,
[2:37] because thou defendest them, let them
[2:39] also that love thy name be joyful in
[2:42] thee. For thou, Lord, will bless the
[2:44] righteous with favor. Wil thou compass
[2:47] them as with a shield. Amen.
[2:51] Praise God. When I wake up in the
[2:52] morning and think of the great things
[2:54] you've done for me. Amen. I feel like
[2:56] praising him. Let's sing it this
[2:57] morning.
[3:00] M
[3:03] when I wake up in the morning
[3:07] great things
[3:10] God has done for me
[3:14] in my heart there's such rejoicing
[3:19] today
[3:21] has gone on me
[3:26] all the glorious mysteries in God's word
[3:30] that he
[3:32] has allowed me to share.
[3:37] It's only an indication of his great
[3:41] love
[3:43] and how much he cares.

[3:54] him.

[4:25] unto me.
[4:28] Showing me the things that were and
[4:31] things that are
[4:35] things that are to be.
[4:39] What has been hidden from the eyes of
[4:42] the wise and the brass
[4:47] to his own?
[4:51] A message of reparation
[4:54] to take us to our eternal home.

[11:55] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[11:58] [Music]
[11:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask Brother Tony to come
[12:09] and open the service in a word of prayer
[12:11] this morning. We've got uh couple of
[12:14] testimonies. Brother Gordon said, "I had
[12:16] a small stroke on Thursday night. 18
[12:18] hours later, I was walking, talking, and
[12:20] witnessing my healing. the power of
[12:22] prayer by all the saints and God's grace
[12:24] is here today. Amen. Thankful for that.
[12:28] Brother uh Emanuel Gindo says, "A year
[12:31] ago, my wife was involved in a car
[12:33] accident and IBC said it was 100% my
[12:36] wife's fault. We took them to court and
[12:39] without a lawyer and a witness, the
[12:41] judge changed the decision, said that my
[12:44] wife was not guilty. Thanks and praise
[12:46] to the mighty lawyer and judge Jesus
[12:48] Christ." Amen.
[12:50] Amen.
[12:53] Our sister uh Roxan Hoffman.
[12:57] Um
[12:58] got a note here from our brother Nelson
[13:00] Guy. Would like to thank you for your
[13:02] prayers for his grandson Jeffrey. He had
[13:04] surgery on Saturday night for a cyst
[13:07] that was pressing on his spine. He is
[13:09] doing well and learning to walk again
[13:11] with a walker. However, he still needs
[13:13] prayer for salvation. So, let's remember
[13:15] him this morning. Amen. And if you have
[13:18] a request that you want
[13:22] taken before the Lord this morning, you
[13:23] lift it before him as we go to prayer.
[13:25] If you're listening in, you do the same
[13:27] thing. Just We've got a God who hears,
[13:30] knows our our requests even before we
[13:33] ask. Let's remember brother Tom as well.
[13:35] He's down in Phoenix this morning with
[13:37] the saints there. Amen. Tony if you
[13:40] come.
[13:44] We also got word from China that those
[13:48] uh believers that were uh arrested, they
[13:51] are serving time right now. They're
[13:53] doing hard labor and uh the testimony
[13:56] that came back because there could be a
[13:58] way to maybe pay the fine or whatever.
[14:00] And they says we're we're prepared to
[14:02] leave this in the hands of Almighty God.
[14:05] I think that's very admirable, very
[14:07] honorable. And so we want to remember
[14:09] these brothers in prayer and also we got
[14:11] word from Iran that uh one of the
[14:13] believers there in one of the cities we
[14:14] visited. I don't think he was in the
[14:16] meetings we were in but nevertheless uh
[14:18] they were also picked up by the police
[14:20] as well. So these are trying times.
[14:22] Amen. Let's join our hearts together in
[14:24] prayer.
[14:25] Lord Jesus truly we have come into your
[14:28] presence this morning with great
[14:30] expectation.
[14:31] Lord we want to see you high and lifted
[14:34] up in our midst. This is our confession,
[14:36] Father, that you have triumphed
[14:38] gloriously over every evil spirit. You
[14:41] are the one, Lord, that descended down
[14:43] into hell. Oh God, you kicked the doors
[14:46] off of hell itself when you took the
[14:48] keys away from, Lord, the tormentor, the
[14:51] accuser of the brethren, the one who has
[14:54] inadvertently taken that which was not
[14:56] his, a dominion that you provided to
[14:58] Adam. And oh God, as you descended into
[15:00] the realms of the lost, Lord, you proved
[15:03] your great power. And Lord, you rose
[15:05] triumphant. And you, Lord, have given to
[15:07] us great and exceeding wonderful gifts,
[15:10] Lord. That whereby we can be overcomers
[15:12] this morning, whereby we can worship
[15:14] you, whereby we can honor you with the
[15:17] fruit of our lips, and we can praise you
[15:19] and bring a a sacrifice, a living
[15:22] sacrifice, that you may be pleased with
[15:24] our lives and our testimony and our
[15:26] confession. How thankful we are for
[15:28] healing our brother Gordon. Lord, Lord,
[15:30] how thankful we are for the other
[15:32] testimonies of how you've been merciful
[15:34] to Nelson Guy
[15:36] grandson or nephew, whatever he is.
[15:38] Lord, we we pray for his soul, Father,
[15:40] that you would move upon this young man,
[15:43] this grandson. And Lord, save his soul,
[15:45] Father. Lord Jesus, we hold up these
[15:48] other needs before you as well in China,
[15:50] our precious brothers that are standing
[15:52] firm for the testimony of your word.
[15:54] Father, comfort them and strengthen them
[15:56] and deliver them. Father, you are our
[15:59] great judge, our great advocate as you
[16:02] delivered us to Gindo. Lord, deliver
[16:04] these brothers out of the mouth of the
[16:06] lion. We pray, Lord, for our precious
[16:09] believers in in Iran and other places,
[16:11] Lord, that are under oppression. Father,
[16:13] we hold them up before you, Lord. We
[16:16] remember brother Tom and the services
[16:18] that he is in this weekend. We remember
[16:20] brother Ernie as he is in the
[16:21] Philippines. We pray for Brother Dier in
[16:24] the services this afternoon in Tacoma.
[16:26] Lord, may you pour out a blessing upon
[16:28] these saints. And Lord Jesus, as we are
[16:31] here now and Lord, everyone that is here
[16:34] in this building and by way of extended
[16:36] audience through the internet and
[16:38] telephones, Lord, we are a needy people
[16:40] today. We come to the house of God, a
[16:43] house of deliverance with great
[16:45] expectation. Feed our souls, Lord Jesus.
[16:49] Move in our midst, Lord. We need a fresh
[16:52] and filling father. We need the
[16:54] corrective word of God. We need the
[16:57] demonstration of your power. Lord, may
[16:59] you move through our pastor as our
[17:01] desire. And Lord, may you convict the
[17:03] backslider. May you, Lord Jesus, restore
[17:06] the joy of salvation. Lord, may you
[17:09] deliver those that are bound and
[17:10] oppressed. Meet every need in divine
[17:12] glory is our prayer and desire as we ask
[17:15] all these mercies in the name of our
[17:17] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[17:23] And you may be seated.

[17:35] visiting with with us. We're happy to

[19:40] [Music]
[20:06] [Music]
[20:49] Wandering out in the dark of night, I
[20:54] could not find my way.
[20:58] [Music]
[20:59] &gt;&gt; I was lost and torn apart. Alone and so
[21:06] araid.
[21:09] Tears became my company.
[21:13] My friends had all withdrawn.
[21:19] Words of prayer just seemed to fall. I
[21:23] found no comfort there.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; There a lot of voice of prayer lifted me
[21:35] somewhere
[21:40] where I've seen his glory in the holy of
[21:45] holies. I've seen him face to face.
[21:50] There I found my rapture by his word and
[21:55] captured. I am hardened by his grace.
[22:01] Standing in the presence of the King
[22:07] of Kings.
[22:10] Standing in his presence. I am living in
[22:17] his presence.
[22:20] Standing in his presence, I am changed.
[22:29] [Music]
[22:35] Now I walk much differently.
[22:39] A child of God. I'm found.
[22:45] His word revealed inside of me. It's
[22:49] Christ my Lord come down.
[22:54] Priest, the judge, the coner,
[22:58] the mighty God is he.
[23:03] His glory reigns in majesty.
[23:07] Christ Jesus is the king.
[23:13] Lifted by his presence near into
[23:17] eternity
[23:24] where I've seen his glory in the holy of
[23:28] holies. I've seen him face to face
[23:33] where I found my rapture by his word and
[23:38] captured. I am pardoned by his grace.
[23:43] Standing in the presence of the King of
[23:50] Kings.
[23:52] Standing in his presence. I am living in
[23:59] his presence.
[24:01] Standing in his presence. I am changed.
[24:14] [Music]
[24:27] [Music]
[24:28] And we've got a baby dedication this
[24:30] morning. Brother Peta and Sister Sheila
[24:32] are going to bring their little one. And
[24:34] uh as I do and as brother Episcopal
[24:37] comes, let's sing together. When he
[24:38] cometh, when he cometh to make up his
[24:40] jewels, number 2484 in the on the
[24:42] screen.
[25:02] When he cometh, when he cometh to make
[25:07] up his jewels, all his jewels, precious
[25:12] jewels, his love and his own.
[25:18] Like the stars of the morning, his
[25:22] bright crown adorning,
[25:25] they shall shine in their beauty.
[25:29] his love for his crown. The last verse,
[25:33] little children, little children who
[25:37] love their redeemer
[25:40] are the jewels, precious jewels, his
[25:44] love and his own. Like the stars of the
[25:50] morning, his bright crowns adorning,
[25:55] they shall shine in their beauty bright.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:07] Well, it's uh always our pleasure to
[26:11] dedicate another one of our children. to
[26:14] think that they're born into this kind
[26:17] of a home where they're going to hear
[26:20] the name of Jesus Christ.
[26:23] And I wanted to just share a few
[26:26] thoughts with our brother Peter and
[26:29] sister Sheila from the scriptures. It's
[26:32] always very different and I I wonder why
[26:36] it's different, but I guess God knows
[26:38] why it's different. But right in the
[26:40] middle of this my scripture reading
[26:42] yesterday, I came on a scripture that I
[26:46] felt was so suited to this occasion. Our
[26:51] brother Peter and sister Sheila have
[26:54] called their son,
[26:57] third son,
[27:00] Wesley, second name, and Gabriel his
[27:03] first name.
[27:05] Gabriel, man of God.
[27:08] He's almost 11 months old. He's a big
[27:11] boy.
[27:13] And uh there may be relatives on the in
[27:17] the central part of Canada that are
[27:19] streaming and we certainly uh welcome
[27:22] them to this dedication.
[27:25] There's a scripture
[27:28] uh Moses speaking to the people. He
[27:32] said, "Consecrate yourselves today
[27:35] to the Lord, even every man, upon his
[27:39] son
[27:41] and upon his brother, that he may bestow
[27:44] upon you a blessing this day."
[27:48] And then I thought of how
[27:51] uh that is connected to the service
[27:54] today. Brother Peter as a father, Sister
[27:57] Sheila, as a mother.
[27:59] Jacob laid his hands upon his sons and
[28:02] upon Joseph's sons. There is a
[28:05] significance
[28:07] when the father in his place of
[28:09] responsibility
[28:11] takes and identifies that responsibility
[28:13] in that headship and lays his hand upon
[28:16] his son. I'm going to pray for
[28:18] dedication for Gabriel Wesley in a few
[28:22] moments, but I'm ask Peter to join me
[28:24] and lay his hand upon him as a father.
[28:28] And I think it's a good thing not just
[28:30] on this occasion but through life. And
[28:34] then the scripture tells us that Moses
[28:37] laid his hands on Joshua
[28:39] to identify and to pass
[28:42] uh from him to Joshua.
[28:45] Not just a blessing but a commandment
[28:47] and a charge. He said he gave him a
[28:49] charge.
[28:51] And I believe that Joshua didn't realize
[28:53] what the full responsibility that charge
[28:55] is. And even as we lay our hands on our
[28:57] children, they don't realize what it
[28:59] really will mean on in life. But God
[29:02] knows.
[29:04] And uh even Jacob, I thought of Jacob
[29:06] when he laid his hands and he he uh
[29:08] crossed his hands and uh and Joseph
[29:12] said, "No, no, no. It's a it's a wrong
[29:14] one." But it was the right way. That's
[29:17] that. And those boys didn't know what
[29:18] was happening. They didn't know at all
[29:21] what was happening. Joseph didn't
[29:22] understand it. But God knew when a
[29:25] father reaches out his hand, lays his
[29:27] hand on his son and then Jesus when I
[29:30] brought the children to have them
[29:31] dedicated, not dedicated but to bless
[29:34] them. The Bible says he touched them.
[29:38] I don't have to hold this child but I
[29:40] often do but it's the main thing is to
[29:43] to touch them to identify what is
[29:45] happening. And then
[29:47] I want to say sister Sheila,
[29:50] brother Brandham said in the message
[29:52] inner man, he said, "How many of you
[29:55] mothers?" He said, "What mother doesn't
[29:58] know what laying on of hands means when
[30:02] a little baby's ftting and crying and
[30:06] everything and let the mother's hand
[30:08] just touch that baby. That settles it."
[30:12] The little fellow stops crying and
[30:15] huddles up to his mother. It's laying
[30:18] your hand. It's mother. It's a contact.
[30:21] And in the message leadership, he said
[30:24] the mother, she was the first one that
[30:26] received the child and and and had
[30:29] contact with it. And then she handed it
[30:31] to the school teacher. Then the school
[30:33] teacher handed back to the father and
[30:36] the father taught him business. And then
[30:38] the father handed them to the rabbi. And
[30:40] the rabbi taught him spiritual things.
[30:43] And he said, "Then now, who's leading
[30:45] you?"
[30:48] And I'm going to say to brother Peter
[30:50] and sister Sheila,
[30:52] "We're going to have this dedication,
[30:53] but don't stop laying your hand on him.
[30:56] Keep your hand upon this son. And even
[30:59] if he should get to be and the Lord
[31:01] Jesus should tar and he should get to be
[31:03] a young teenager and even end up going
[31:05] his own way and you see him going in a
[31:07] direction that you feel sad and you're
[31:09] broken about. Keep your hand on him.
[31:12] Keep your hand on him. Keep your
[31:14] spiritual influence on him and give him
[31:16] some footsteps to follow.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:22] Gabriel,
[31:24] come to me my boy.
[31:28] Gabriel Wesley.
[31:30] Amen. We'll pray. Our loving heavenly
[31:34] father, how we thank you for this jewel
[31:37] that you have given into the home of our
[31:39] brother Peter and sister Sheila. Lord,
[31:42] their third son Gabriel.
[31:45] Lord Jesus, I put my hand upon him and I
[31:49] ask now that brother Peter, his father,
[31:52] will lay his hand on him. And I pray,
[31:55] Father, that the heart and desire
[31:58] of this father will pass onto this son.
[32:00] His desire for God, his desire, Lord,
[32:04] for eternal life.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; And I pray this desire will never leave
[32:08] this son.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I dedicate him to you in the
[32:12] name of Jesus Christ.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; The God that gave him into this home.
[32:18] Father, I pray that you will now receive
[32:20] him into your everlasting arms and that
[32:23] he shall know what the name of Jesus
[32:25] means. He shall know what Calvary means.
[32:27] He shall know what the message means. He
[32:29] shall know, oh God, what you have done
[32:32] in this generation. Thank you. I
[32:34] dedicate him in the name of Jesus
[32:37] Christ. Gabriel Wesley. Amen.
[32:46] God bless you, sister Sheila. God bless
[32:48] you, brother Peter. Amen.
[32:53] Hallelujah.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[33:01] Amen.
[33:03] Well, Brother Rod sang my chorus.
[33:09] We lift him up to the highest place.
[33:13] Amen. I just so love that love that
[33:18] chorus.
[33:20] We place him in the highest place. We
[33:22] want to do that this morning. And
[33:24] perhaps we will sing a chorus or two
[33:27] before we're done. Was there anything
[33:29] else, brother Rod? You had. All right.
[33:32] Uh,
[33:35] I understand I heard you praying for the
[33:38] believers in China
[33:40] and uh
[33:43] not a whole lot has been said. We're not
[33:44] going to say a whole lot. There's five
[33:46] of them that have been arrested.
[33:50] They've been in uh
[33:53] they were reported by uh the local uh
[33:57] three self church members of the church.
[33:59] We understand it was reported that they
[34:02] had attended some meetings where a
[34:04] foreigner was speaking. I believe it was
[34:06] brother Chris Hall was having meetings
[34:09] and they had traveled to another city
[34:12] and were attending the meetings and then
[34:14] when they got home they witnessed about
[34:15] the message and what God was doing
[34:19] and uh now some of you young people in
[34:21] school you think you suffer some things
[34:25] and we as individuals
[34:28] mothers and fathers families and so they
[34:31] began to witness and it was uh re
[34:34] reported that they had attended a
[34:36] meeting where foreigners were speaking.
[34:38] Uh the police came to them and then the
[34:42] police handed them over to the national
[34:44] security
[34:45] and uh they were arrested
[34:48] and from there they were put into hard
[34:50] labor. So that's where they are today.
[34:54] uh
[34:56] they heard that it might be possible one
[34:58] of the wives of the one of the brothers
[35:01] is not a believer
[35:03] and uh she understands that she could
[35:05] get her husband out for quite a large
[35:07] sum of money.
[35:10] uh the the the other people are aware of
[35:13] it also
[35:15] uh that it might be possible but they
[35:16] said no they refused deliverance
[35:19] because they said you know we have been
[35:22] placed here for the name of Jesus Christ
[35:26] for the gospel of Jesus Christ and we're
[35:28] not prepared to accept deliverance if
[35:30] God wants us out he can get us out but
[35:33] we're staying here and uh uh I thought
[35:37] of that
[35:40] they could possibly be freed. It's not
[35:42] sure, but they could possibly be freed,
[35:44] but they've refused that. And the other
[35:47] reason they refused it is because if
[35:50] they pay once, then they authorities
[35:52] realize all we have to do is arrest them
[35:54] and we get big sums of money. So, they
[35:57] are not going to bend to that. I praise
[36:00] God. You know, they haven't had they
[36:02] haven't had years and years and years in
[36:04] the message,
[36:06] &gt;&gt; but already it's a reality to them.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; They have such a a sense of balance.
[36:12] Nice to see you, brother John Sacker. I
[36:14] see you acknowledging brother John. God
[36:16] bless you. Just good to see your face,
[36:18] Sister Esther. My God bless you. Nice to
[36:22] have you. And I know that's real close
[36:24] to your heart. I was thinking just in
[36:26] the last uh few days, last week or two,
[36:30] I thought about brother John Sacker,
[36:32] brother John Lei and how they initially
[36:35] went over and handed books and took them
[36:37] in pack sacks and stood outside of the
[36:39] three self church and handed the books
[36:42] as the people came out and and uh
[36:46] brother John, you brothers are have a
[36:48] reward for everything that's happening
[36:50] there. You're just part of it. That's
[36:52] all there is to it. That's what we
[36:54] believe.
[36:55] Amen.
[37:00] I just got in the last hour before
[37:04] coming to church just received an email
[37:08] and I'm going to take a few minutes
[37:09] before we turn to the word. So I hope
[37:11] you don't mind. Shalom our dearest
[37:14] brother and pastor in Christ. We have
[37:17] influx of brethren from the Ivory Coast.
[37:22] How many been hearing about the Ivory
[37:23] Coast? There's a terrible, terrible
[37:26] conflict there. People are being killed,
[37:28] being slaughtered. They're ready. United
[37:30] Nations are trying to do something.
[37:32] They're trying to send maybe some help
[37:35] in there.
[37:37] And uh
[37:39] they're fleeing from the Ivory Coast.
[37:41] These are some believers that are
[37:42] fleeing from the Ivory Coast from the
[37:44] crisis. And they are here with us in
[37:47] Liberia, but stranded. no food and even
[37:52] safe drinking water. Brother Biscoll, we
[37:56] plead to you. They are dying slowly and
[38:00] want you assist with funds to buy food
[38:04] and give some of them proper medication.
[38:07] God bless you. Shalom, Pastor Enoch
[38:10] David. Now, when we receive a a
[38:13] desperate uh thing like this, uh we
[38:16] don't just jump and respond instantly.
[38:19] We want to confirm what is uh really
[38:22] what the situation is. Sometimes that
[38:25] takes uh uh a little while. It takes
[38:28] some phoning. It takes some call. And uh
[38:32] I I just want to say a word about men of
[38:36] vision in this regard.
[38:38] Now, we're sitting here in in comfort
[38:41] today, and we're sitting here. We're
[38:43] going to leave here. We're going to go
[38:44] and eat our our dinner or lunch,
[38:47] whatever. We're going to fellowship.
[38:50] We're going to be comfortable.
[38:53] We're going We have what we have need of
[38:55] most of us. And if you don't, it is
[38:58] available, I'm sure. Uh but now here's
[39:02] some people. Uh there are believers in
[39:05] China. They're in hard labor. And also
[39:07] in the email, they said it's snowing.
[39:10] They're it's cold. Uh all we can do is
[39:13] pray for them. That we have a
[39:15] responsibility to do. But there's others
[39:19] and we can do one of two things. We can
[39:21] just sit up our you know close up our
[39:23] bowels of compassion or we can come
[39:26] forward and say what can we do? That was
[39:29] the concept behind men of vision and uh
[39:32] we had people just who are probably
[39:35] streaming right now from Switzerland and
[39:37] they sent two emails. They just wanted
[39:40] to do something for the saints in
[39:41] Granada. The thing is as a in the
[39:45] ministry, we don't have the time to
[39:48] follow up all of these things here.
[39:50] Here's a a real live need. And my heart
[39:54] starts to be wrenched, but I don't have
[39:56] I might make a phone call and say, "This
[39:58] is a solid brother. This is a real
[40:00] devoted pastor." But that's as far as I
[40:03] can go as far as, you know, doing all
[40:06] the logistics and maybe seeing how and
[40:09] is there a possibility and maybe we can
[40:12] Hey, we've sent brethren, we've had them
[40:14] fly over to different countries to do
[40:16] things just to uh set things up or to
[40:20] deliver uh some help or some aid. So,
[40:24] that's not the impossible. But what we
[40:27] need is men. We need devoted men. And I
[40:31] really feel, you know, I know that
[40:33] brother Rod as busy as he is, brother
[40:36] Ken, brother Randy Snow, these three
[40:38] brothers, there have been others who
[40:40] said, you know, what can I do? But it's
[40:42] not a matter of just sitting back and
[40:43] saying, what can I do? It's a matter of
[40:44] saying, I am here. I'm ready. Put me to
[40:47] work. What do you want me to do? Is
[40:48] there something that I can do? Uh, it's
[40:51] one thing to take up. I'm not going to
[40:52] take up an offering, but one thing we
[40:54] could take up an offering and, you know,
[40:56] put $20 in the plate or whatever more
[40:58] and then it's just out of our minds.
[40:59] that is isn't really what we need. It
[41:02] isn't what we need just that, but it is
[41:05] to have people that are burdened.
[41:08] And that is quite frankly, and I haven't
[41:10] told the church, but in about 3 weeks,
[41:12] I'm going to Ghana because there's been
[41:15] such uh a demand and such a pressure, a
[41:18] spiritual pressure to to be there.
[41:21] There's going to be there's going to be
[41:23] people from six nations. And one of the
[41:26] nations which was just speaking on
[41:28] behalf where they've had some meetings
[41:30] on this crisis is in Burkina Faso. In
[41:33] fact is brother Brett and sister Anne's
[41:35] son and daughter-in-law were there as
[41:38] missionaries for some time. So she got
[41:40] quite sick and had to come back. But
[41:42] that is where the meeting was just
[41:43] taking place I believe yesterday on
[41:45] account of this crisis. And Ghana is
[41:47] right next door as well right in the
[41:50] same region. They said there will be
[41:52] people from from the Ivory Coast and
[41:55] brethren are going to be there from the
[41:56] Ivory Coast. So I will be with some
[41:58] brothers that will know a whole lot
[42:00] about this probably in the next 3 weeks
[42:02] on the 20th. I'll leave on the 20th. The
[42:05] meetings are for four or five days uh
[42:08] right over Christmas. And I thought,
[42:09] well, another Christmas. I'm without the
[42:11] family. And uh who knows at my age it
[42:14] could be the last Christmas. But it's
[42:15] it's I'm driven with a passion and a
[42:19] concern for the body of Christ. And I
[42:22] think that that's what that's what
[42:24] everyone needs to be in their own place,
[42:26] in their own area, in their own realm.
[42:28] And and uh you know, it's it's not easy
[42:31] to do good because when you do good,
[42:34] evil's present.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; See, the devil's always there to stop,
[42:38] to throw up a roadblock or do something
[42:40] one way or another. But don't ever lose
[42:42] your desire. You know, if you can't do
[42:45] anything else, if uh you sisters, you
[42:47] say, "Well, men of vision, what can the
[42:49] sisters do?" And I tell you what, there
[42:51] have been women of God down through the
[42:53] scripture that went on their knees and
[42:56] prevailed upon God and accomplished
[42:58] great things for the kingdom of God. Can
[43:01] this congregation believe that? Can you
[43:03] say amen to that? And so we don't want
[43:05] to become you know just uh a information
[43:09] receiving station where we just hear
[43:11] things and you know that are happening
[43:13] elsewhere in the world. But I want that
[43:15] this congregation to be uh just
[43:20] involved. I want them to be uh uh a part
[43:25] of what is taking place and so that you
[43:28] feel that and you you know that you're a
[43:30] part of it. You're a part of it in
[43:32] prayer. You're a part of it in giving.
[43:34] You're a part of it in going. You're a
[43:36] part in in doing something whether it be
[43:39] as as you know as mundane as licking a
[43:42] stamp or
[43:44] doing assisting some way or another. And
[43:46] I just thought I told brother Rod I said
[43:48] I just want to give a a men of vision a
[43:51] punch because I really believe even
[43:54] though it's quiet even though Satan has
[43:55] fought that real real hard and you know
[43:58] I say this to I think our shame I don't
[44:02] say our shame here as a church but even
[44:04] as a movement amongst believers some of
[44:06] the hardest and most skeptical people to
[44:08] move as preachers. They're afraid
[44:10] they're going to lose something. They're
[44:11] afraid they're going to lose some able
[44:13] man or lose some offering or lose some
[44:16] nothing. We don't ask for any of that. I
[44:18] But I I really feel that when there's
[44:20] men within a congregation and you know,
[44:23] you you save up and maybe take a
[44:26] vacation someplace. Well, quite frankly,
[44:28] you know, I've taken just about all my
[44:30] grandsons, not for a trip. I took them
[44:33] to the Philippines. I took them to
[44:35] Africa. Brother Tom took one son to to
[44:37] Poland and let them see uh Warsaw and
[44:40] let them see uh where they where the
[44:42] Jews were were slaughtered by the
[44:45] millions and let you know let them
[44:47] become a part of the of of the work.
[44:50] We've taken brothers and brother
[44:52] Michelle to Congo and the other brothers
[44:54] to Congo and brother Isaac Nash to the
[44:57] Congo. I don't think they'll ever ever
[44:59] forget that. And some of the sisters
[45:01] have gone. They wanted to just go and
[45:03] observe. it'll be a part of their life
[45:05] forever. And I I think now it's uh
[45:08] anyone who has ever gone and said, "I
[45:11] want to do something. I want to be of
[45:12] help." I don't think they've ever
[45:14] regretted that. Not everybody can go.
[45:17] That's granted. But I think that we can
[45:19] all be a part of it. One way or another
[45:21] can be a part of it.
[45:24] So you take that for whatever.
[45:28] When you live for others,
[45:31] &gt;&gt; you're looking heaven in the face. Amen.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Do you still believe that?
[45:36] &gt;&gt; And you can live for others right here.
[45:39] There's needs all around us. People are
[45:41] needy. You find h how can I do it? Well,
[45:45] you might find somebody who's kind of
[45:47] going loose and kind of going astray.
[45:49] Don't don't just stand back. Just, you
[45:52] know, pitch in there and do what you
[45:53] can. Encourage them and go and see them
[45:56] and invite them over and put them in
[45:58] another atmosphere. Say they're getting
[46:00] in the wrong atmosphere. will create the
[46:02] right one for them. Have them over you.
[46:04] You're you're you can be at mission
[46:06] right here, right here. And we need it.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, we need missionaries
[46:12] &gt;&gt; right here.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Right in this countrymen.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; You don't believe me. This is probably
[46:18] the most critical place you can find.
[46:21] North America, land of plenty and land
[46:24] of ease and land of all the rest of it.
[46:26] We're more in danger of backsliding than
[46:28] anybody.
[46:30] We're the ones who really want to keep
[46:32] our our our spiritual senses sharpened.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't want to preach before I'm
[46:38] supposed to. All you young people, I
[46:41] want you to listen. Well, Sister Magda,
[46:43] I was just going to mention your name.
[46:46] Sister Magda, who's just standing there
[46:47] at the back. She uh she has been in
[46:50] contact with a a girl and they've been
[46:53] on uh internet and speaking back and
[46:56] forth. This girl I think is 13 or 14 14
[47:03] years old and she just come in contact
[47:06] with the gospel through sister Magda in
[47:09] the church here. I think they have
[47:12] streamed a meeting or two. She has been
[47:15] streaming some meeting somehow. Her
[47:18] mother just died. They thought her
[47:20] father was going to die first from a
[47:22] brain tumor. Her father has survived.
[47:25] He's still living, but they have no
[47:27] place to live. The doctor, the doctor at
[47:30] the hospital actually took them into his
[47:34] own home, and they're staying at the
[47:36] doctor's house right now. She was at
[47:38] school. The school she's at is largely
[47:41] Muslim. At least she has mostly Muslim
[47:44] in her class as I understand it. And
[47:47] they got on her case about Jesus Christ.
[47:51] They said that Jesus was nothing more
[47:53] than a prophet. She said he was God and
[47:56] Jesus Christ was God. And because she
[47:59] stood up for Jesus and made him more
[48:01] than just a man, they said he was just a
[48:03] man. She wouldn't accept that. And so
[48:05] they said, "We're going to meet you
[48:07] after school." After school, there was a
[48:12] a a big fight. And she didn't know any
[48:15] more than to defend what she believed.
[48:18] And they came against her physically.
[48:20] And she reacted physically. And they put
[48:24] her, she's in the hospital with broken
[48:26] bones and everything else. And she put
[48:29] five of the six in the hospital also. It
[48:32] was such a fight. And they said there
[48:34] was blood everywhere. It was a It was a
[48:37] gruesome fight. But she was fighting for
[48:39] the defense of Jesus Christ. And they
[48:42] don't even know what the outcome of all
[48:43] of this is going to be when they're
[48:45] finally out of the hospital. She's in
[48:48] contact with us from the hospital. And I
[48:50] read some of her emails. are long long
[48:54] and this girl's name is I don't know
[48:56] exactly how to pronounce it but I think
[48:58] it's Murtha probably Murtha correct and
[49:02] uh I was touched by her by her account
[49:07] by her testimony she doesn't know what
[49:08] to do and she hasn't got anybody to
[49:10] speak to she hasn't got anybody hasn't
[49:12] got anybody her mother just died just
[49:15] just days ago and she's really alone in
[49:18] the world and I I think that it would be
[49:21] Wonderful. You talk about doing
[49:23] something. I think be wonderful if a 14,
[49:26] 15 year old, 16 year old girl or older
[49:29] would say, "I'd like to write her and
[49:32] and just really encourage her and and
[49:35] give her some friendship."
[49:37] You know, we we sit here and it it's
[49:39] quite easy. And maybe some of you young
[49:42] people think that you've gone through
[49:44] some hard things, but let me tell you
[49:47] something. You really don't know what
[49:49] hardship is. There's some real hardship
[49:52] in the world and there are some people
[49:54] that are standing up for what's right.
[49:57] And so you want to be thankful and say,
[49:59] "Well, what can I do?" Well, one thing
[50:00] you can do is be thankful to God that
[50:03] you're sitting here today and you're
[50:05] able to be under the sound of the gospel
[50:07] and you can just tell the Lord how much
[50:09] you love him
[50:11] &gt;&gt; and give him what he desires.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we I want you to remember
[50:16] Mirththa
[50:18] and Pastor David Enoch and the saints in
[50:21] Liberia,
[50:23] the believers in in China.
[50:28] Oh, it's a wonderful hour we're living
[50:30] in, friends. And I'll tell you what, one
[50:33] of these moments, you're just going to
[50:35] take one breath, and that's going to be
[50:38] your last breath here. You're going to
[50:40] be changed in your body, and you'll
[50:42] start one step. You'll be putting one
[50:44] foot forward and that next step will be
[50:46] in the millennium
[50:47] &gt;&gt; because he'll say in a moment in the
[50:49] twinkling of an eye, we're going to be
[50:51] changed. Then what what is all this
[50:53] other going to mean?
[50:55] &gt;&gt; What's everything going to mean? We're
[50:57] happy to have our brother Vern Nygard
[50:59] here. Brother Vern is the father of
[51:02] brother Wes and brother Jeff Nygard.
[51:04] Brother Vern, why don't you stand? Been
[51:06] a believer for many years there. God
[51:09] bless him.
[51:15] Well, would you mind standing with me?
[51:18] And I'd like to just sing that once
[51:20] again. We place you in the highest
[51:23] place.
[51:25] Let's just move into the realm of the
[51:27] Holy Spirit. Shall we do that? Would you
[51:29] do that? Would you pray for me this
[51:31] morning? I'm just I'm wanting to address
[51:34] something and I want to move into a
[51:36] subject that I can't possibly finish
[51:38] just now. And I don't know perhaps what
[51:41] exactly I should say, but I want to I
[51:43] want him to say it. And I've offered him
[51:45] already. I said, "Lord, you be my
[51:49] you take my lips
[51:51] and my tongue. I dedicate it now to
[51:54] you." And let's all of us within
[51:56] ourselves say, "I give you my mind. I
[51:58] give you all that I am, all that I ever
[52:01] can be. And I'm going to lift you in the
[52:03] highest place." God bless you.
[52:06] [Music]
[52:08] Place you
[52:12] in the highest place.
[52:16] For you
[52:19] are the great high praise.
[52:23] We praise you.
[52:27] above
[52:29] all
[52:31] else
[52:32] [Music]
[52:38] and we come to you
[52:42] and worship
[52:45] your king
[52:48] from the bottom of your heart. Once
[52:50] again please we place you
[52:55] in the highest place.
[53:01] Oh,
[53:02] great high priest.
[53:05] We bless you.
[53:10] Our love
[53:12] [Music]
[53:15] [Applause]
[53:18] [Music]
[53:20] and we call you
[53:24] worship.
[53:26] [Applause]
[53:27] [Music]
[53:35] their heads bowed. Heavenly Father,
[53:40] we're not only placing you in the
[53:41] highest place. There is no God
[53:45] that can compare with you. There is no
[53:47] other God that's a living God.
[53:50] You're the God of Israel, the God of
[53:53] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of
[53:56] creation.
[53:57] You are the father,
[54:00] our father which art in heaven. And we
[54:04] say today, hallowed be thy holy and
[54:07] righteous name.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; And as we come in the name of Jesus
[54:11] Christ, we are saying, let your will be
[54:13] done on earth as it is in heaven just
[54:15] now. Lord, I pray you will work through
[54:18] your vessels, work through your body,
[54:21] work through your church.
[54:24] Let your word be engraved upon the
[54:27] tablets of our heart now Lord and give
[54:31] voice and give speech. Give utterance oh
[54:34] God by the Holy Ghost. We are helpless
[54:37] without you. We can do nothing. Touch
[54:41] lives here oh God. Touch men and women I
[54:44] pray. Move them into a spiritual realm
[54:49] and out of this natural passing fading
[54:52] world.
[54:53] Move, oh God, your children. I pray be
[54:57] with those that are far distant places
[55:00] but yet very close by internet. Lord,
[55:04] they're meeting in so many places. I
[55:06] pray that you'll bless them. Anoint me
[55:09] now, Lord, and anoint the people in
[55:12] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[55:16] We're going to turn in the Bible
[55:21] and I'm going to read some from Exodus
[55:24] the 32nd chapter. And while you're
[55:27] turning, I want to formally welcome our
[55:32] uh Brother Eric and Sister Kylie Funk. I
[55:35] don't know whether they have been
[55:39] uh where's Brother Eric and Sitra?
[55:42] They're on holidays.
[55:44] And I choose the day they're on
[55:46] holidays. I thought they've been on
[55:48] holidays for about three months in
[55:50] Australia or someplace.
[55:52] All right. Well, I'm going to wait till
[55:54] I get back. But brother Eric and Sister
[55:56] Kylie, they sold their home in the
[55:59] Okonogan and they have actually formerly
[56:01] moved here and with their family. And
[56:04] although we've seen them on a regular
[56:06] basis, always came to the family camp
[56:09] and as often as they could, but we're so
[56:11] happy for them because we love them and
[56:15] we're going to receive them in the name
[56:16] of our Lord Jesus Christ. All right.
[56:19] While you're standing, we're going to
[56:21] read uh selected portions from Exodus
[56:25] chapter 32. And then I want to read a
[56:27] few verses from Genesis 3, starting at
[56:30] verse 9. Then,
[56:33] and when the people saw that Moses
[56:35] delayed to come down out of the mount,
[56:38] the people gathered themselves together
[56:41] unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make
[56:44] us gods, which shall go before us. For
[56:48] as for this Moses, the man that brought
[56:51] us up out of the land of Egypt, we ought
[56:54] not, what is become of him. And Aaron
[56:58] said unto them, Break off the golden
[57:00] earrings which are in the ears of your
[57:02] wives, of your sons, and of your
[57:05] daughters, and bring them unto me. And
[57:09] all the people break off the golden
[57:10] earrings which were in their ears and
[57:14] brought them unto Aaron. And he received
[57:16] them in their hand and fashioned them
[57:20] in uh fashioned it with a graving tool
[57:24] after he had made it a molten calf. And
[57:27] they said, "These be thy gods, O Israel,
[57:30] which brought thee up out of the land of
[57:32] Egypt." And when Aaron saw it, he built
[57:35] an altar before it. And Aaron made
[57:37] proclamation and said, "Tomorrow is a
[57:40] feast to the Lord." And they rose up
[57:43] early on the tomorrow and offered burnt
[57:45] offerings and brought peace offerings.
[57:47] And the people sat down to eat and to
[57:51] drink and rose up to play.
[57:55] And the Lord said unto Moses, "Get thee
[57:58] down, for thy people which thou
[58:00] broughtest out of the land of Egypt have
[58:02] corrupted themselves."
[58:04] And then I want to
[58:07] uh turn a little further to uh God said
[58:10] he was going to destroy them. But look
[58:11] at verse 11. And Moses besought the Lord
[58:15] his God, and said, Lord, why do thy
[58:18] wrath wax hot against thy people, which
[58:21] thou hast brought forth out of the land
[58:23] of Egypt, with great power, and with a
[58:26] mighty hand? Wherefore should the
[58:27] Egyptians speak and say, for mischief
[58:30] did he bring them out to slay them in
[58:32] the mountains, and to consume them from
[58:34] the face of the earth, turn from thy
[58:38] fierce wrath, and repent of this evil
[58:41] against thy people. Remember Abraham,
[58:42] Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom
[58:45] thou swearest by thine own self, and
[58:48] saidest unto them, I will multiply your
[58:50] seed as the stars of heaven, and all
[58:53] this land that I have spoken of will I
[58:56] give to your seed, and that they shall
[58:58] inherit it forever. And the Lord
[59:00] repented of the evil which he thought to
[59:02] do unto his unto his people. And then
[59:05] Moses the from verse 15 on down talks of
[59:09] him coming down and of his anger and he
[59:13] cast down the tablets of stone which
[59:15] were in his hand.
[59:17] And verse 21, and Moses said to Aaron,
[59:20] what did this people unto thee that thou
[59:23] hast brought so great a sin upon them?
[59:25] And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my
[59:28] Lord wax hot. Thou knowest the people
[59:30] that they are set to mischief. Uh for
[59:34] they said unto me, "Make us gods, which
[59:36] shall go before us. For as for this
[59:39] Moses, the man that brought us up out of
[59:41] the land of Egypt, we ought not what has
[59:43] become of him." And I said unto them,
[59:45] "Whosoever hath any gold, let him break
[59:47] it off." So they gave it to me. Then I
[59:51] cast it into the fire, and there came
[59:53] out this calf. And when Moses saw that
[59:58] the people were naked, for Aaron had
[1:00:01] made them naked unto their shame among
[1:00:04] their enemies, then Moses stood in the
[1:00:07] gate of the camp and said, "Who is on
[1:00:09] the Lord's side? Let him come unto me."
[1:00:12] And all the sons of Levi gathered
[1:00:14] themselves together unto him. I will
[1:00:18] read from Genesis, please. verse three,
[1:00:22] I'm sorry, chapter 3, just a few verses,
[1:00:30] starting at verse 9.
[1:00:34] And the Lord called unto Adam, and said
[1:00:36] unto him, Where art thou? And he said, I
[1:00:40] heard thy voice in the garden, and I was
[1:00:43] afraid because I was naked, and I hid
[1:00:47] myself.
[1:00:49] And he said, "Who told thee that thou
[1:00:50] was naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree
[1:00:53] whereof I commanded thee that thou
[1:00:56] should us not eat?" And the man said,
[1:00:59] The woman whom thou gavest to me to be
[1:01:02] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I
[1:01:05] did eat. And the Lord said unto the
[1:01:07] woman, "What is this that thou hast
[1:01:09] done?" And the woman said, "The serpent
[1:01:11] beguiled me, and I did eat."
[1:01:16] I'll stop reading there. You may be
[1:01:18] seated. Thank you for remaining
[1:01:21] reverend while we read the word of God.
[1:01:27] I pray that God will help me
[1:01:29] and I ask you to be as quiet and
[1:01:32] reverent as possible.
[1:01:39] After Eve said, "And the serpent
[1:01:42] beguiled me and I did eat." The Lord
[1:01:45] said unto the serpent,
[1:01:48] "Because thou hast done this," he didn't
[1:01:51] ask him. He just said, "Because you have
[1:01:54] done this, thou art cursed above all
[1:01:56] cattle, and above every beast of the
[1:01:57] field. Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and
[1:02:00] dust shalt thou eat all the days thy
[1:02:02] life, and I will put enmity between thee
[1:02:04] and the woman, and between thy seed and
[1:02:06] her seed, and it shall bruise thy head,
[1:02:08] and thou shalt bruise his heel." Brother
[1:02:10] Brandham said, "Because the woman took
[1:02:13] life out of the world, God was going to
[1:02:17] cause her to bring life into the world.
[1:02:19] I'll greatly multiply thy conception and
[1:02:22] thy sorrow." I want to speak on the
[1:02:24] blame game.
[1:02:30] One of the principles
[1:02:33] that is here in this re scripture, in
[1:02:35] fact, it's both scriptures which we read
[1:02:37] today.
[1:02:39] And these principles span the entire
[1:02:42] spectrum
[1:02:44] of our life. It's our a whole
[1:02:47] psychological makeup
[1:02:50] is in these verses.
[1:02:52] It is so human.
[1:02:55] We are so given over to it that it's I
[1:02:59] would say all of us have engaged in it
[1:03:02] at one time or another
[1:03:04] and perhaps engage in it
[1:03:07] most every day
[1:03:10] and that is what is commonly known today
[1:03:12] as the blame game. We blame someone
[1:03:17] else. Now
[1:03:20] although and I'm going to go slowly
[1:03:22] because I want to go very carefully.
[1:03:26] Although we may at times there may be
[1:03:29] times when we respond inappropriately.
[1:03:33] We may say something
[1:03:37] uh we may do something we may act in a
[1:03:40] certain way that we regret right
[1:03:42] afterwards.
[1:03:46] we may uh respond in a way that we're
[1:03:51] very
[1:03:53] discouraged about. It gets us we we feel
[1:03:57] unhappy with ourselves.
[1:03:59] Uh there are those times we afterward we
[1:04:02] regret it. We may be drawn into the
[1:04:05] affairs of others inadvertently,
[1:04:08] not willingly. Sometimes there's no way
[1:04:12] to escape it because others it might be
[1:04:15] family, it might be extended family or
[1:04:18] friends, it might be brothers or sisters
[1:04:21] in the church, it might be uh you know
[1:04:24] uh work related and uh we will get drawn
[1:04:29] into the affairs of someone else and
[1:04:31] they make decisions which affect us uh
[1:04:36] directly or indirectly and we are
[1:04:38] affected by those decisions.
[1:04:40] And those decisions are not decisions
[1:04:42] that are pleasing to us. And they may
[1:04:44] not be spiritual decisions. They may not
[1:04:46] be something that move us in a spiritual
[1:04:50] direction. And we feel spiritually
[1:04:53] affected by it. Not in a positive sense,
[1:04:56] but in a negative sense. And we may
[1:04:59] respond to such a a situation. We may be
[1:05:03] uh we may be subjected to consequences
[1:05:08] of decisions that someone else may make.
[1:05:10] Someone else makes a decision. I'm going
[1:05:12] to do this. I'm going this way. I'm
[1:05:14] going that direction. And and so much of
[1:05:18] the consequence of their decision falls
[1:05:21] upon you. And you might say, "I never
[1:05:23] asked for this. I didn't want this. This
[1:05:26] isn't good for me. I don't feel this is
[1:05:28] good. I don't feel this is spiritually
[1:05:30] beneficial but there isn't a thing in
[1:05:33] the world I can do someone else's and so
[1:05:36] then the critical thing is how do we
[1:05:39] respond to that that's the critical part
[1:05:43] and I'm going to deal with something
[1:05:45] that I have seen and observed and it's
[1:05:47] it's absolutely catastrophic in its in
[1:05:50] its consequences and that is that and
[1:05:54] I'm going to make a statement there is
[1:05:57] no O valid reason
[1:06:02] for a believer to
[1:06:05] loose or be loosed from their faith in
[1:06:09] God as a result of any of these that
[1:06:12] I've just talked about. There is no
[1:06:15] valid reason for a person to turn aside
[1:06:18] from their faith. There is no valid
[1:06:22] reason for a person to throw in the
[1:06:26] towel and say, "Well, I'm done." There
[1:06:29] is no valid reason for a person to
[1:06:33] backslide.
[1:06:34] Zero. No valid reason. Regardless of
[1:06:38] what happens, regardless of what someone
[1:06:41] says, regardless of what someone does,
[1:06:44] regardless of what comes upon us,
[1:06:46] whether God allows it or whether someone
[1:06:50] else brings it on or whether the devil
[1:06:52] does it, whatever happens in life,
[1:06:55] there's no valid reason for me to
[1:06:57] surrender up my convictions. Your
[1:07:00] convictions,
[1:07:02] there's no valid reason. Amen.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; And though we might have justification
[1:07:08] in laying the blame over here or laying
[1:07:11] the blame over there, that does not
[1:07:14] justify the loosening of a person's
[1:07:16] faith in God. Amen.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; I have watched people drift away
[1:07:28] from the from the very councils of God,
[1:07:32] from the word of God, from the very
[1:07:34] message. I've seen them drift slowly,
[1:07:37] almost imperceptibly, but you can see
[1:07:40] the little danger signs has come along,
[1:07:42] but in a matter of a short period of
[1:07:44] time, they're long gone. Right.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; And if you follow the course of their
[1:07:51] life,
[1:07:52] almost invariably sin enters,
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; the world enters and they become
[1:07:59] swallowed up with the world.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; The world, it could be education. They
[1:08:05] may throw themselves into education. You
[1:08:08] can throw yourself into into business.
[1:08:10] You could throw yourself into pleasure.
[1:08:12] You could throw yourself into sports.
[1:08:15] all of those things your life may you
[1:08:17] may live a good life but that that is
[1:08:21] that that's the very thing I'm speaking
[1:08:23] about now at this moment to me that is
[1:08:26] surrendering up your spiritual
[1:08:29] convictions your spiritual life for the
[1:08:32] things say well because this or because
[1:08:34] that it might not even be a negative
[1:08:36] thing that comes it might be a positive
[1:08:38] thing as far as the world is concerned
[1:08:40] it might be a great test that is coming
[1:08:43] your way it might come in the form of a
[1:08:45] wonderful offer. You know, it might be a
[1:08:48] rose that th Satan throws at the feet of
[1:08:52] the people. Not something negative, but
[1:08:54] something a great opportunity. And Satan
[1:08:57] is sucking you in.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; He's He's attracting you, sucking you in
[1:09:03] to a vortex that you won't have. It will
[1:09:06] squeeze out the God in your life unless
[1:09:10] you take up a real valiant position. I
[1:09:14] mean uh uh not just consecration. I'm
[1:09:17] talking about being determined, being
[1:09:20] resolved, being as the rock of Gibralar.
[1:09:24] You have to keep that.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; And I've seen others I've seen them
[1:09:28] right here in this congregation. I've
[1:09:30] seen them go through college, go through
[1:09:32] university, withstand all of the forces
[1:09:35] of the ungodly atmosphere that is there,
[1:09:39] and still come out the other end serving
[1:09:41] God. and having lived their testimony.
[1:09:43] You don't have to surrender it up. You
[1:09:45] don't have to surrender up your
[1:09:47] testimony. You can live it in the midst
[1:09:49] of all of that wickedness and evil. And
[1:09:51] that's what God intends us to do.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; There is no
[1:09:58] I'm going to be repeating that not
[1:10:00] because I don't think you grasp it, but
[1:10:03] because I want to make it a theme. There
[1:10:05] is no valid reason. Amen.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Don't ever come to me with a valid
[1:10:09] reason that you feel is valid for having
[1:10:12] surrendered up your spiritual walk with
[1:10:15] God. There is no reason.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; And that ought to be 100%.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; An agreement with this congregation.
[1:10:26] Yeah,
[1:10:31] I've heard some of the weakest arguments
[1:10:36] put forward as an excuse for being in a
[1:10:40] backslid condition.
[1:10:45] I wonder what goes on in the mind or if
[1:10:48] that individual even has any concept of
[1:10:52] eternity.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:55] Someone said something, someone did
[1:10:57] something, someone.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; you're going to put that on the scale
[1:11:04] with eternal life over in this side.
[1:11:06] What is it over here that's worthy of of
[1:11:09] of missing out over here? Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; And even though even though what we are
[1:11:21] going through and some have been dragged
[1:11:24] through vicious,
[1:11:27] terrible, horrific circumstances, some
[1:11:30] have been dragged through it, not even
[1:11:32] as a result of their own decision or
[1:11:34] their own doing. And that's when it's
[1:11:36] really, really hard. But that is the
[1:11:38] time that you need to shore up. That's
[1:11:40] the time you need to strengthen your
[1:11:42] faith in God. That's the time you need
[1:11:45] to draw nearer to Christ
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; and seek your answers from the word.
[1:11:56] Sometimes
[1:11:59] even though we are going through some of
[1:12:01] these things and I'm going to identify
[1:12:03] some just before we turn to this some
[1:12:05] other scriptures
[1:12:10] I have uh right within this congregation
[1:12:14] and I've seen it elsewhere as you know
[1:12:16] having traveled considerable
[1:12:20] but parents we have our children and we
[1:12:24] raise them we bring them in up in a
[1:12:26] godly atmosphere. They know what it is
[1:12:29] to be in the house of God. They know
[1:12:31] what it is to hear the scriptures read.
[1:12:34] They know the songs of Zion. And they've
[1:12:37] been brought up in the right kind of
[1:12:38] atmosphere. Then they get to be, you
[1:12:40] know, uh start making their own
[1:12:42] decisions. They young men, young women,
[1:12:45] they start trailing off in a direction
[1:12:47] that is so grievous to the parents.
[1:12:52] And they may they may go into the depths
[1:12:55] of sin.
[1:12:57] And then the parents become
[1:12:59] disillusioned,
[1:13:01] disillusioned with the very gospel they
[1:13:04] have their own faith in and start
[1:13:07] surrendering up.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Then they disappear.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; I say that is a double disaster because
[1:13:16] now the one who's away, the young person
[1:13:18] who has drifted off and gone their own
[1:13:21] way, doesn't have a beacon light
[1:13:23] anymore.
[1:13:25] Amen.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; They say, "Well, you know, I understand,
[1:13:29] you know, the pressures of of youth and
[1:13:31] the pressures, the peer pressure and and
[1:13:33] all of this, but where's the beacon
[1:13:35] light? Where's my where's my mother's
[1:13:37] standard? Where's my father's where's my
[1:13:39] father's integrity anymore? Where's the
[1:13:41] beacon light that I once had?
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Where is it? What What is all of this
[1:13:46] that was told me about this pure holy
[1:13:49] gospel? Where is it anymore?" I tell
[1:13:52] you, my brother, my sister, we need, as
[1:13:54] Moses said, who's on the Lord's side.
[1:13:57] Come and stand here. Stand by me. Stand
[1:14:01] by this word. Regardless of what
[1:14:03] happens, say, "Well, I'm disappointed.
[1:14:06] I'm disillusioned. I'm I'm uh uh uh I
[1:14:09] maybe have failed, even though all of
[1:14:11] that may be true.
[1:14:14] You might be discouraged. You might be
[1:14:16] disillusioned. You might have failed.
[1:14:18] But there's no valid reason for giving
[1:14:22] up a spiritual walk with God.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; None whatsoever.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; You'll never get me to change that
[1:14:29] sentence.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; There's no valid reason.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; You need to you need to even strengthen
[1:14:39] your stand with God so they have a they
[1:14:42] have a a a sure light, a beacon light.
[1:14:45] You can say whatever my child does,
[1:14:47] whatever my son does, whatever my
[1:14:50] daughter does, whatever my brother, my
[1:14:52] husband, my wife or whoever they are,
[1:14:54] whatever they do, I shall remain
[1:14:56] unmovable.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; That means let it be so.
[1:15:12] I'm coming down to our address today.
[1:15:18] Say some weward son, some weward
[1:15:20] daughter. And then and then they get in
[1:15:23] and and and and are are being
[1:15:25] counseledled or being under the
[1:15:27] influence of the Holy Spirit say, "Wow,
[1:15:29] you know,
[1:15:31] the waring that goes on their mind. My
[1:15:34] goodness, when I turned aside from these
[1:15:37] things, my mother went out and cut her
[1:15:39] hair and put on pants and went into the
[1:15:42] world and and all the rest of it and
[1:15:44] goes around with makeup and who knows,
[1:15:45] maybe with some other man or whatever
[1:15:47] more, you talk about a struggle. They've
[1:15:50] got a horrible battle to overcome
[1:15:53] because of that. But if they can turn
[1:15:54] around and say, "My mother, she would
[1:15:57] not stop praying for me. My mother, she
[1:16:00] remained steadfast. I could go home and
[1:16:02] she was there. I could go to church and
[1:16:05] she was there. My father, he raised the
[1:16:08] standard. He told me, "Whatever happens
[1:16:10] to you, son, I'm here. I'm praying for
[1:16:12] you. Whatever happens to your wife,
[1:16:14] husband, whatever more, I'm here. I will
[1:16:17] be unmovable. I will be undaunted in my
[1:16:20] in my faith in God.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; And my faith goes beyond this life.
[1:16:27] Whether it happens here or I'll be
[1:16:29] believing it when I rise in the
[1:16:31] resurrection.
[1:16:33] I said, "I'll be believing it when I
[1:16:35] rise in the resurrection."
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; There's an example in the scripture
[1:16:51] where the young people, the young man,
[1:16:56] God came and spoke to him. You'll know
[1:16:58] who it is in just a moment.
[1:17:01] God came in the form of an angel, a man
[1:17:04] to him
[1:17:06] and addressed him. His name was Gideon.
[1:17:10] And he's the one who made the statement,
[1:17:12] "If God before us, where be all his
[1:17:14] miracles?
[1:17:16] Where is this God?"
[1:17:18] His father had groves. His father had
[1:17:22] idols. His father was a circumcised
[1:17:25] Hebrew
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; who had gone back
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; and had idols.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Had gone back to his old life.
[1:17:37] But there was something in this young
[1:17:38] man.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; I tell you, there was something in him.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Even though father's given up and
[1:17:44] surrendered his faith in God, in the God
[1:17:47] of Israel, I will not be moved.
[1:17:51] Oh, God give us men like that.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; God give us young men like that.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; You know what kind of a message he got?
[1:18:17] God said, "Take your father's altar,
[1:18:20] throw it down,
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; and cut down his grove and throw down
[1:18:25] his idols and destroy them."
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; He respected him. He respected his
[1:18:33] father. He loved his father. But he was
[1:18:36] not going to surrender up
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; what God had spoke to him, what God had
[1:18:40] made real to him.
[1:18:43] I appreciated what happened. He feared
[1:18:46] him enough. The Bible says, "And it came
[1:18:48] to pass."
[1:18:51] Judges 6, you can just jot it down if
[1:18:53] you want. Came to pass the same night
[1:18:55] that the Lord said unto him, "Take thy
[1:18:58] father's young bullock, even the second
[1:19:01] Even the second bullock of seven years
[1:19:03] old, and throw down the altar of Baal
[1:19:06] that thy father hath, and cut down the
[1:19:09] grove that is by it, and build an altar
[1:19:12] unto the Lord thy God upon the top of
[1:19:15] this rock." What is it that he's doing?
[1:19:17] What is it that God is doing? God is
[1:19:19] saying, "Disregard.
[1:19:21] have no respect to to what your father's
[1:19:24] gone back to, but remain absolutely
[1:19:27] steadfast and build an altar to God.
[1:19:30] Cast down this other thing.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, cast down." You
[1:19:35] know what? There's idols. Maybe a father
[1:19:37] go back who who knows? Maybe his idol in
[1:19:40] the world was some sports fans or
[1:19:43] whatever more. Who knows what it was?
[1:19:45] Maybe it was entertainment. Maybe it was
[1:19:47] the movies. Maybe it was the television.
[1:19:50] He was addicted to it. He was a couch
[1:19:51] potato. Whatever it is. But now God
[1:19:55] begins to breathe some new life into
[1:19:57] some young man, some son. And he says,
[1:19:59] "I'm going to cast that thing down. I
[1:20:02] won't have any part with that. I'm going
[1:20:04] I'm going the way of holiness.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; I'm going the direction of the God of
[1:20:09] Israel. I'm not going to have anything
[1:20:11] to do with that. I cast it down
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to raise up I'm going to
[1:20:16] raise up an altar to God."
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My father going to come into
[1:20:20] my presence. He's going to know. He's
[1:20:22] going to know that I'm serving the God
[1:20:24] who sent this word to us in this hour.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to call what's clean
[1:20:29] clean. I'm going to call what's unholy
[1:20:31] unholy. I'm going to call purity purity.
[1:20:34] I'm going to call sin sin
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; in the face of father, mother, or
[1:20:39] whoever else.
[1:20:44] And Gideon took 10 men of his servants
[1:20:47] and did as the Lord had said unto him.
[1:20:49] And and so it was because he feared his
[1:20:52] father's household. He did have some
[1:20:54] fear for his father's household. He
[1:20:57] respected it. And the men of the city
[1:21:01] that he could not do it by day, so he
[1:21:02] went and did it by night and he
[1:21:05] destroyed and cut down the grove.
[1:21:07] Incidentally, when they cut down groves,
[1:21:09] it took years and years and years to
[1:21:11] grow those trees.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; It took years to establish what was
[1:21:16] established. And when you cut down trees
[1:21:19] in that country, you were doing a very,
[1:21:21] very severe damage to a person.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; And he went and cut all the trees down.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; And cast down the idol. Brother John.
[1:21:31] Hallelujah.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says,
[1:21:34] "And when the men of the city rose up
[1:21:36] early in the morning, and behold, the
[1:21:38] altar of Baal was cast down, and the
[1:21:42] grove was cut down that was by it, and
[1:21:45] the second book was offered upon the
[1:21:47] altar that was built. And they said one
[1:21:50] to another, "Who hath done this thing?"
[1:21:54] And when they inquired and asked, they
[1:21:57] said, "Gideon, the son of Joash, hath
[1:22:00] done this thing.
[1:22:04] Oh my,
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; there was something there had to be
[1:22:13] something within Gideon.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; They saw some integrity in him, in his
[1:22:19] life. He hadn't made a great mark in the
[1:22:22] world, but there was something in him.
[1:22:25] There was a not merely a stability, but
[1:22:27] there was a strength.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; I like to use the word integrity. There
[1:22:32] was a real in spiritual integrity. They
[1:22:34] could say there was something different
[1:22:36] about him. He took the things of God
[1:22:38] serious. No doubt he kept his nose in
[1:22:41] the Torah. He was in the law of Moses.
[1:22:44] And thinking about it, he was it was on
[1:22:46] his mind. He perhaps said to his
[1:22:49] friends, "Where is the where is the God
[1:22:51] of Israel? Where are these miracles that
[1:22:54] God has sent? Where is the old where is
[1:22:57] the priesthood they used to stand for
[1:23:00] the the the law and the word of God to
[1:23:02] us? Where are the men?
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Where are the family? Look where we
[1:23:07] are." He probably thought with grief,
[1:23:09] "My own father, my own father has gone
[1:23:12] back to his gods,
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; living there in idolatry.
[1:23:18] which was adulterous,
[1:23:20] living there, worshiping there, probably
[1:23:24] within his own mind and imagination.
[1:23:26] Someday I'd like to go up there and cut
[1:23:28] that grove down. I'd like to destroy
[1:23:31] that old altar of Baal that was in him.
[1:23:34] And God saw that was in him. Listen to
[1:23:37] me, my brother, my sister. God sees
[1:23:38] what's in your heart.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; God sees what's there.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; It's not just sitting there for not. God
[1:23:46] sees what's there. The day will come
[1:23:48] when he'll speak to an individual. Say,
[1:23:50] "Stand up."
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Be counted now.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, well, the church is going
[1:23:57] loose and the church is going
[1:23:58] laxidasical and this and that." Stand up
[1:24:01] then. Be counted
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; for the God of this word.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing. If you merely
[1:24:15] sit back, this generation isn't going to
[1:24:18] take you in a God-word direction.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; If you just sit back, young people, your
[1:24:23] school isn't going to take you in a
[1:24:24] godward direction.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; For most of you, except those that are
[1:24:29] in the school that are here and and and
[1:24:31] most of you are not because you're in
[1:24:33] senior years. Your teachers are not full
[1:24:36] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; They're not full of the Holy Ghost.
[1:24:40] They're not going to encourage you on
[1:24:42] you. I I trust and pray God that you
[1:24:44] have a beacon light at home where you
[1:24:46] have a father and a mother that are
[1:24:48] urging you on and putting you in an
[1:24:50] atmosphere, a spiritual atmosphere and
[1:24:53] sending you in that direction.
[1:25:00] I perhaps haven't got the best
[1:25:02] footprints in the world,
[1:25:07] but I don't want to be ashamed of them
[1:25:08] either.
[1:25:11] And I don't mind saying to my three
[1:25:14] daughters,
[1:25:17] follow dad's footsteps.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; And I think that's the very least we can
[1:25:21] say.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Follow dad's footsteps.
[1:25:25] Maybe we didn't make a big mark in the
[1:25:27] world, but at least it'll take you back
[1:25:28] to the house of God.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Dad's footsteps will lead you to an
[1:25:32] altar. Dad's footsteps will lead you to
[1:25:34] a chair. Dad's footsteps will lead you
[1:25:36] to a place where you can read the word
[1:25:38] of God.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, dad's footsteps,
[1:25:49] mother's footsteps led you shopping.
[1:25:51] Mother's footsteps led you in a big a
[1:25:53] big uh a big spree. Mother's footsteps
[1:25:55] had you led you to all the garage sales
[1:25:58] in the country. Shame.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; You can do what you want with this
[1:26:02] message, but I say shame." Yes.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; You want mother's footsteps to show that
[1:26:07] they led them to a place where where
[1:26:08] they knew how to pray, where they knew
[1:26:10] how to get answers from God.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; And there may be mothers here today that
[1:26:14] need to repent today.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Repent means turn around. Go the other
[1:26:19] direction. We need to change our course.
[1:26:22] There are fathers today that need to
[1:26:24] repent. Don't I don't care what you
[1:26:26] think of this message. If it's a truth,
[1:26:28] if it's the truth, then say amen to the
[1:26:31] truth. If it's the truth, then say, "I'm
[1:26:33] going to do it."
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; I'm burning up, friends.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; It's been on my mind for some time, and
[1:26:43] I really waited on God. I know I won't
[1:26:46] even begin to finish what is on my
[1:26:49] heart. But if you'll just help me. But
[1:26:51] my biggest concern is that you don't sit
[1:26:54] and listen and think this is just
[1:26:56] another sermon. I'm speaking directly to
[1:26:59] the individuals today. I'm speaking to
[1:27:01] families in this church. I'm speaking to
[1:27:03] individuals. I want them to hear it.
[1:27:05] Whether it's the women in the in the
[1:27:07] nursery, I want them to sit quiet and
[1:27:08] hear. Or whether it's those that are
[1:27:10] connected on the internet. Last Sunday,
[1:27:12] we had 88 88 places that were tuned to
[1:27:15] us on the internet. It doesn't do me any
[1:27:17] good if people sit here and then go out
[1:27:19] and live their own way. It's not our own
[1:27:21] selfish life anymore.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; We're a part of the body of Christ and
[1:27:26] we are responsible to one another. and
[1:27:28] parents especially responsible to their
[1:27:30] children. God is going to hold you
[1:27:32] responsible. How you led and the kind of
[1:27:35] light you left for your children to
[1:27:38] follow. God gave them to you.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; God gave that life to you. And at least
[1:27:43] of regardless of what happens to them,
[1:27:46] you want to be able to stand before God
[1:27:48] and said, "I left the best beacon light
[1:27:50] I knew. I I I did all I knew to do.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Am I my brother's keeper?
[1:27:59] Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; We might say, "I don't have any friends
[1:28:06] in the church." I've heard that. I don't
[1:28:08] have any friends in the church. I'm the
[1:28:10] only one. I don't have any friends in
[1:28:11] the church. Yeah, there's a lot of young
[1:28:12] people. There's a lot of someone else.
[1:28:14] There's a lot of families, but I don't
[1:28:15] have any friends in the church. So,
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to throw in the towel. God
[1:28:22] will hold you accountable for that.
[1:28:24] That's right.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to loosen up. I'm going to go
[1:28:28] and seek friends elsewhere in the world.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; God going to hold you accountable for
[1:28:32] that.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; And what you sow, you're going to reap.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. You're going to reap it.
[1:28:37] That's the law of God's word. I don't
[1:28:39] have to say it. You're going to reap it.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; And I'm here today to prevent you from
[1:28:43] reaping it.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; And so, it's the blame game.
[1:28:56] Well, because of this,
[1:28:58] because of what someone did,
[1:29:01] because a set of circumstances,
[1:29:09] we make an excuse
[1:29:13] because I got a certain physical
[1:29:16] thing. I've leaned on the arm of flesh.
[1:29:23] So long
[1:29:25] that's all I trust anymore is the arm of
[1:29:27] flesh.
[1:29:30] I just run to the doctor and I haven't
[1:29:32] got anything but going to a doctor. I
[1:29:33] was to one just the other day. But I run
[1:29:36] to the doctor. I just And now I've just
[1:29:38] become so dependent.
[1:29:41] I'm going to come right down there. No
[1:29:43] use beating around the bush.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; I've got so depressed with my situation.
[1:29:48] And they've got me on on this kind of
[1:29:49] pill. got me on that kind of pill. And I
[1:29:52] can tell you those pills going to take
[1:29:54] you and drift you away from God, not
[1:29:56] closer to God.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Because they become dependent.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; I've visited people in the hospital that
[1:30:06] become absolutely dependent upon their
[1:30:09] drugs.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; And those drugs never took them in a
[1:30:13] direction of faith.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Always took them in a direction of
[1:30:16] unbelief. And it had so many side
[1:30:19] effects they become psychotic.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; They weren't themselves anymore. I have
[1:30:25] visited with people years ago. They are
[1:30:28] not the same people today.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; And I am speaking that not against
[1:30:33] individuals. I'm speaking that against
[1:30:35] the devil himself.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; I despise that enemy.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; And it did not restore their faith. It
[1:30:42] destroyed their faith. They became so
[1:30:45] dependent upon those things. You know,
[1:30:47] one of the big things today, in fact,
[1:30:48] there's this big news last week and
[1:30:51] there's a big movement within the
[1:30:53] Canadian government and the and the
[1:30:55] First Nations, which are the native
[1:30:57] Indian people, are appealing to the
[1:30:59] government, come and help us because you
[1:31:02] have made such a great percentage of our
[1:31:05] people addicts.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; You have made them addicts.
[1:31:11] And they did a survey this last few
[1:31:14] days, this last week. And there were
[1:31:16] people, there were people, native
[1:31:18] people, and this also is in our
[1:31:21] community, native people taking up to
[1:31:23] 15. They were going to one doctor and
[1:31:26] then another doctor and another doctor
[1:31:28] so they could acquire all the drugs that
[1:31:30] they needed. And they had up to 15
[1:31:32] prescriptions.
[1:31:36] Literally legal drug addicts.
[1:31:41] Say, why are you saying that?
[1:31:45] You don't have any right to claim a
[1:31:46] message
[1:31:48] and be a legal drug addict.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, then you're saying the
[1:31:53] message which is Christ is powerless.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; I got my power in a bottle.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; I got my help in a bottle.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Where are we, friends? Where are we? You
[1:32:08] have a message and you got your aid in a
[1:32:10] Bible.
[1:32:12] Where's the power of God?
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Where is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
[1:32:17] Jacob? Where's the God that that Gideon
[1:32:21] called upon? If God be God, where is his
[1:32:24] miracle?
[1:32:25] I'm glad we have the angel of the Lord.
[1:32:28] The same one that delivered this message
[1:32:30] is the same one that's leading us on.
[1:32:42] So, Adam did
[1:32:46] what was only natural for him. I want
[1:32:48] you to notice the words.
[1:32:52] Help me.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; It's not easy preaching this.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Did you eat the fruit?
[1:33:04] His answer should have been yes.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; No, he said the woman that you gave me.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; This really goes right back to you.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Somehow God is responsible.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; God is supposed to be able to He's all
[1:33:23] in and all. He's supposed to be able to
[1:33:25] look after these things. Somehow God
[1:33:27] failed. And people don't say it
[1:33:28] directly. They don't say, "God, you
[1:33:30] failed." But they will put the blame and
[1:33:32] shift it around until it's not their
[1:33:34] fault anymore.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; It's not my fault that you gave me this
[1:33:38] woman,
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; You didn't only create her, you brought
[1:33:43] her to me.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; And she's the problem.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; And if you hadn't brought her to me, I
[1:33:49] wouldn't be in this situation.
[1:33:52] It didn't cut the mustard.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; It didn't work. Right.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; He says, "The woman that you gave me,
[1:34:01] she gave it to me."
[1:34:06] Go to the woman.
[1:34:09] Did you eat it? She doesn't say yes
[1:34:11] either.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Says, "Well, the serpent that you know,
[1:34:16] you made the serpent.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; I didn't create him. You created him.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; I didn't make him so handsome. Right?
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; And he beguiled me. He had the power.
[1:34:28] And beguile is also not only it it means
[1:34:31] to to to beguile a person is to beguile
[1:34:34] them sometimes by charm
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; or by deception.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said she was deceived.
[1:34:41] So she's simply saying, "I didn't know
[1:34:43] what I was doing."
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; I didn't know it was going to come out
[1:34:46] this way. How did I know this was going
[1:34:49] to happen?
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; I didn't know. I was deceived into it.
[1:34:56] Okay. So then God goes the serpent.
[1:35:00] He didn't say did you do this? He said
[1:35:03] because you did it.
[1:35:06] I'm glad, brother Brandham, how we had a
[1:35:09] prophet in this day. Says, "Finally, in
[1:35:11] the final analysis, all of this sin and
[1:35:13] all this unbelief will be tracked right
[1:35:15] back down through history and come right
[1:35:18] back on him who created it or not
[1:35:20] created, but who invented it in the
[1:35:22] first place." And I'm going to rejoice
[1:35:24] when Satan fa when Satan feels the full
[1:35:27] impact of all of the unbelief and sin.
[1:35:29] But in the meantime, we're not to give
[1:35:31] in to him. We're not going to surrender
[1:35:34] up to him, friends. And I pray that this
[1:35:36] church here
[1:35:41] will have a sound in the earth that it
[1:35:44] has stood for truth
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; and it has stood with a force and a
[1:35:49] strength and integrity and the people
[1:35:52] were unmoved, undaunted
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; in their faith. Amen.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; And the message token,
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; he said, "We know that this hour is
[1:36:07] here. This hour is here now.
[1:36:11] Judgments is at hand."
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; And what are we going to do with it?
[1:36:16] That's because the message had now
[1:36:18] arrived and the token was being applied.
[1:36:21] And he said, "There's only one way
[1:36:26] you could ever get it off of you."
[1:36:30] He said, "I'd hate to have his blood
[1:36:32] upon me in in that sense. There's only
[1:36:35] one way he can get it off you." He said,
[1:36:36] "You can't wash it off." Pilate tried
[1:36:39] that. He tried to pass the buck on to
[1:36:42] somebody else. He said, "Send him over
[1:36:44] to Caesar."
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "He couldn't. You can't pass
[1:36:49] the buck.
[1:36:53] or to someone else. He said it
[1:36:55] backfired. It fell right back on him. In
[1:36:59] the message preparations
[1:37:02] said Eve wrapped herself up in some fig
[1:37:04] leaves and Adam, but when it came time
[1:37:07] to face God,
[1:37:11] they were condemned.
[1:37:14] They realized that their man-made
[1:37:17] religion wouldn't work.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when God called them, he said,
[1:37:21] "Now how true it is today when God had
[1:37:24] prepared himself to speak with a Adam
[1:37:27] and Adam in a man-made way was trying to
[1:37:30] prepare himself." And I see this also
[1:37:33] people try to prepare themselves to
[1:37:36] speak to God, but God had to prepare
[1:37:38] Adam to speak to him. So in order to do
[1:37:42] that, they begin to pass the buck one to
[1:37:45] the other in the old street expression.
[1:37:48] And then what happened? God went out and
[1:37:50] got some skins and made made them
[1:37:53] aprons.
[1:37:55] God was the only one that had a solution
[1:37:58] for the situation that they were in. And
[1:38:00] he's the only one this morning that has
[1:38:03] a solution for the situation that we
[1:38:05] find ourselves in. This a very complex
[1:38:09] generation, a very weward generation. I
[1:38:13] was thinking this morning as I was in
[1:38:16] prayer early this morning. Well, not
[1:38:19] that early, but it was fairly early
[1:38:24] and I was thinking I started praying for
[1:38:26] some of you children. I was thinking of
[1:38:27] this girl Merta
[1:38:30] and I was just thinking what kind of a
[1:38:32] what kind of a start did she have in
[1:38:34] life? And I begin to think of you young
[1:38:37] people here and a lot of them born now.
[1:38:39] You're young men and women, you have
[1:38:41] your own families. they've got children.
[1:38:43] I got thinking, you know, when they were
[1:38:45] just young, Lord Jesus, I'm going to be
[1:38:48] speaking to people this morning and they
[1:38:50] some of when they were five and six and
[1:38:53] four years old and they heard the
[1:38:55] gospel, they heard about Christ
[1:38:58] and they've seen the power of God and
[1:39:00] then they grew on up and they became
[1:39:03] into the age of accountability and they
[1:39:06] were baptized and they went on further.
[1:39:09] Today they're young men and young women
[1:39:10] and some of them are parents and have
[1:39:12] their children
[1:39:14] and some have drifted off. Some have
[1:39:17] gone.
[1:39:19] Parents have gone the way of the world
[1:39:23] been swallowed up by the earth as it was
[1:39:26] in the scripture.
[1:39:28] But I thought, "Oh God,
[1:39:31] help us
[1:39:34] so that we remain steadfast,
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; unmovable."
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; And friends, we can't do it in our own
[1:39:41] strength. But the God who sent this
[1:39:43] word,
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; the God who delivered it, the God who
[1:39:46] proved it is the same God today.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Absolutely the same today. Does this
[1:39:53] congregation believe that? You believe
[1:39:55] that?
[1:40:04] We can't pass it off to someone else.
[1:40:12] I could go on and on
[1:40:18] when the governments
[1:40:22] in the city whenever anything you know
[1:40:26] goes sideways then they see where we're
[1:40:29] going to lay the blame.
[1:40:34] There came a crisis and we read about it
[1:40:36] in chapter 32.
[1:40:41] shame a crisis and this is a crisis
[1:40:43] friends don't
[1:40:45] don't let your mind wander now this was
[1:40:47] a crisis that God never forgot
[1:40:51] and it may not have looked so bad but
[1:40:53] the people started to say
[1:40:56] where is this man
[1:40:59] Moses
[1:41:00] that brought us out
[1:41:03] and led us into this wilderness you know
[1:41:05] what they forgot you know what they
[1:41:07] forgot
[1:41:08] You know what? They forgot
[1:41:12] something that we we not the churches
[1:41:15] surrounding here, but we as believers
[1:41:18] are in grave danger.
[1:41:21] It's not a man who led us out to where
[1:41:24] we are.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; It's not a preacher.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; It's not even William Brham that led you
[1:41:29] out where you are.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; And the thing they were missing, they
[1:41:32] said, "Where is this man?" But God spoke
[1:41:35] to them directly through Moses and said,
[1:41:38] "The angel of the Lord shall go before
[1:41:41] you and lead you to where you're
[1:41:44] supposed to go." And they failed to
[1:41:46] remember. They failed to know that I am
[1:41:50] here because the angel of God has led us
[1:41:53] here.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; I say to this congregation, if you've
[1:41:57] been led for any other reason, you're in
[1:42:00] the wrong track.
[1:42:04] You're in the wrong track. If you've
[1:42:06] been following Ed Biscll, you're in the
[1:42:07] wrong track.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; If you just been following a man, people
[1:42:11] have thought, well, you know, if it's
[1:42:13] brother Brandham the prophet, it is
[1:42:15] indeed. But it's more than him. It's
[1:42:17] what came out of his mouth.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; And so, because many stay connected to
[1:42:22] the man, they got to have another man
[1:42:24] and another man. They got to have
[1:42:25] another hero, another one with a special
[1:42:27] revelation. And they have led them into
[1:42:30] some sad direction. Amen.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; So
[1:42:43] they went to the priest.
[1:42:48] You know, I have been called. I'm going
[1:42:50] to say some things here you probably
[1:42:52] never heard.
[1:42:54] I've been called by those that had grand
[1:42:57] revelations. I've been called. Oh,
[1:43:00] you're just a kind old priest. You're
[1:43:03] the one that kisses the babies. But
[1:43:05] those very men that uttered those words
[1:43:07] today, I don't even know where they are.
[1:43:09] Some of them, their churches have blown
[1:43:10] to pieces and they're off in the
[1:43:12] mountain someplace. They've stopped
[1:43:14] preaching the gospel. Some are backslid,
[1:43:16] whatever more. And I I just say to the
[1:43:18] glory of God, they call me what they
[1:43:21] want. But I'm still here declaring this
[1:43:23] gospel. And I intend to stay here. And I
[1:43:26] intend to preach it. And I intend to go
[1:43:28] out of this world in a blaze of fire for
[1:43:30] the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; And I want you to do the same. I want
[1:43:36] you to make that same commitment. Say,
[1:43:38] "The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of
[1:43:41] Jacob is my God."
[1:43:44] The God of the prophet of God, the God
[1:43:46] of William Brandham, the God of Elijah
[1:43:48] is my God.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; And this message is a word of God that
[1:43:52] has come to us. It's a revealed word.
[1:43:55] And I don't find another word in the
[1:43:57] world that is that is sustaining the
[1:43:59] people in this generation. And so when
[1:44:02] we say that we have this, it is here.
[1:44:05] The pillar of fire is here. And the
[1:44:07] angel of the Lord has led us here. Let
[1:44:10] us not get let us not get uh uh our
[1:44:13] minds filled with other thoughts that
[1:44:15] we're here because some man brought us
[1:44:17] here or some church brought us here. It
[1:44:20] is the God of the word. It is the God
[1:44:22] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It
[1:44:25] is none other than the God of Elijah
[1:44:27] that is still present here today.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; But the conditions got to such a place.
[1:44:36] He said, "We know not."
[1:44:43] Moses delayed to come down from the
[1:44:45] mountain. And the people gathered
[1:44:47] themselves to Aaron
[1:44:50] and said up make us gods
[1:44:53] that may they may go before us.
[1:44:57] He delayed us. He delayed. I'm going to
[1:45:00] go slowly.
[1:45:03] In the Hebrew it is that
[1:45:07] we have been brought to we're ashamed.
[1:45:11] We have been disappointed.
[1:45:19] uh we're ashamed before one another
[1:45:21] sometime we're ashamed before the people
[1:45:24] because
[1:45:27] okay and I'm just going to give you a
[1:45:28] scenario because we stood so true we
[1:45:32] stood steadfast
[1:45:34] we said this is the word this is the
[1:45:35] message of the hour it's not like any
[1:45:37] other message and then our families grew
[1:45:39] up under I committed my family I
[1:45:41] committed my wife to it I committed and
[1:45:43] maybe the wife went this way or the
[1:45:44] husband went that way or the children
[1:45:46] went this way and and and where is this
[1:45:49] God of William Brown? Where's this God
[1:45:53] that brought this message? Where is this
[1:45:55] God? And then
[1:45:58] that's just exactly what Satan wants you
[1:45:59] to say.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; And then that person gives up and
[1:46:05] surrenders their
[1:46:09] courageous strength and they they they
[1:46:13] just surrender it up. They surrender up
[1:46:14] their convictions.
[1:46:16] What they're saying is this man brought
[1:46:20] us out into this wilderness and now he's
[1:46:24] gone and we're we're stuck out here and
[1:46:27] now we're disappointed.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; And what are the nations going to say?
[1:46:32] We're we're ashamed.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; That's what they're saying.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; He has delayed.
[1:46:38] He has we're disillusioned with him this
[1:46:41] message. And that's exactly what
[1:46:43] happened to the disciples at the cross.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; They said, "We're disappointed.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Where's the miracles? Where's the great
[1:46:50] signs? Where's the great things that are
[1:46:53] supposed to happen?" And they're not.
[1:46:55] Where's this Christ of power? Oh, my
[1:46:58] brother, my sister, God is not uh God is
[1:47:02] not being confounded with any of of the
[1:47:04] of the things that man does. Amen.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:47:14] the Bible says also
[1:47:21] they made a calf. God speaks of it in
[1:47:23] Psalms. He speaks of it in Ne in
[1:47:26] Nehemiah. God never forgot that they
[1:47:29] made this calf.
[1:47:32] He never forgot it.
[1:47:35] David said they made a calf in Harb and
[1:47:38] worshiped the molten image. And Nehemiah
[1:47:41] said, "Yay, when they had made them a
[1:47:43] molten calf, and said, this is thy God,
[1:47:46] and brought thee up that brought thee up
[1:47:48] out of Egypt, and it wrought great
[1:47:50] provocations."
[1:47:51] This was a great
[1:47:54] sin. The scripture speaks of it to the
[1:47:57] people. And so now I want us to see how
[1:48:00] this progressed. Are you listening?
[1:48:02] Amen.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Watch how it progressed, please.
[1:48:11] The people failed to realize
[1:48:15] that was the angel of the Lord. I I
[1:48:17] referred to it, but let me read it to
[1:48:19] you. In Exodus 23, we're in Exodus 32.
[1:48:22] But long before that, God spoke and
[1:48:26] said, "Behold, I send an angel before
[1:48:28] thee to keep thee in the way, and to
[1:48:31] bring thee into the place which I have
[1:48:33] prepared. Beware of him and obey his
[1:48:37] voice." Not even speaking about Moses
[1:48:39] now. Beware of him, the angel. Obey his
[1:48:42] voice, which would speak through the
[1:48:44] prophet. Amen.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; And obey his voice, and provoke him not,
[1:48:48] for he will not pardon your
[1:48:49] transgressions, for my name is in him.
[1:48:52] But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice,
[1:48:54] and do all that I speak, then I will be
[1:48:58] an enemy unto thine enemies, and an
[1:49:01] adversary unto thy adversary. Have we
[1:49:03] got adversaries? Yes, we have many. God
[1:49:06] said, "You follow the angel of the Lord,
[1:49:09] the one who brought the word to you, the
[1:49:11] one who brought you to it. You follow
[1:49:13] him and I'll be an enemy to your
[1:49:15] enemies.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; I'll be an adversary to your adversary.
[1:49:19] I tell you friends, that's the kind of
[1:49:21] that's the kind of uh language I like to
[1:49:23] hear.
[1:49:38] And Moses in his commission,
[1:49:41] he said, "And we without a leader are
[1:49:44] helpless." And Christ is our leader, and
[1:49:48] God was Moses leader, though he sent an
[1:49:51] angel to lead him.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "I I send my angel before thee
[1:49:56] to keep thee in the way, and to bring
[1:49:59] thee to the place which I have
[1:50:01] promised." The angel was their leader.
[1:50:06] My brother, my sister, Sunday morning,
[1:50:08] 10:30, you're here in a service.
[1:50:14] And many of you have come from all we've
[1:50:17] come from all walks of life and all
[1:50:20] kinds of geographical locations. We have
[1:50:23] one thing in common.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; That is that the angel of the Lord has
[1:50:28] led us to where we are.
[1:50:32] Not some man,
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; not some shiny thing, not some program,
[1:50:38] not some other thing that enticed you,
[1:50:41] but something within you.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; God, the angel of the Lord brought you
[1:50:47] to where you are. Yeah,
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; some of you came across the seas, across
[1:50:52] lands, across continents, across states,
[1:50:55] across provinces, and then you said,
[1:50:57] "Well, uh, I arrived and, uh, and my
[1:51:00] life took such a turn, and here I found
[1:51:02] my wife. You didn't find your wife." The
[1:51:04] angel of the Lord led you there. The
[1:51:06] angel of the Lord led you to where
[1:51:08] you're sitting here today. The angel of
[1:51:11] the Lord want you to hear this service
[1:51:13] this morning.
[1:51:17] You are not here by accident. None of
[1:51:18] you are here by accident. Not one person
[1:51:21] here by accident. The angel of the Lord.
[1:51:24] It has nothing to do with me. This
[1:51:25] message came from God.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; He's the one who vindicated it. He's the
[1:51:30] one who stood there with the pillar of
[1:51:31] fire. He's the one who spoke out of that
[1:51:33] prophet's mouth. He's the one who
[1:51:35] revealed the secrets of the heart. He's
[1:51:37] the one who delivered this message to
[1:51:38] us.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; And it's not complicated.
[1:51:45] It's actually rather quite simple,
[1:51:48] but we failed many times to do it. And
[1:51:51] when we fail to obey the voice, we start
[1:51:55] leaning on the arm of the flesh.
[1:52:00] You might say, "Well, what would you do,
[1:52:02] brother Bis? If you were in my case, I'd
[1:52:04] sooner trust God." In some cases, I'd
[1:52:06] sooner trust God and die.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Than depend on the arm of flesh. If that
[1:52:12] depending dependence on the arm of flesh
[1:52:14] was going to cause me to drift and drift
[1:52:16] and cause me to be out here and be
[1:52:18] something else. God made me who I am.
[1:52:21] God made you who you are.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want you to be something else
[1:52:26] that some uh some some pharmacist has
[1:52:30] made you.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; If I have a pain, I don't mind taking a
[1:52:36] Tylenol or take something else. I'm
[1:52:38] talking about something that's very,
[1:52:39] very evident.
[1:52:44] Brother Herb and Sister Rita Rutherford
[1:52:46] are gone.
[1:52:48] Wonderful saints of God. Brother Tony
[1:52:51] right here. I had to call him in the wee
[1:52:52] hours of the morning one day.
[1:52:59] Sister Rita called me. She says, "Herbs
[1:53:01] on the floor. I can't get them up. It
[1:53:04] was cold."
[1:53:07] And so I called Tony. I said, "Come
[1:53:09] quick. I got to go over there. We
[1:53:12] arrived at his house. I'm telling you
[1:53:13] this because I know it. I'm telling you
[1:53:15] this because I'm speaking from
[1:53:16] experience. And he's laying on the
[1:53:18] floor. He's turned blue.
[1:53:22] Just had had just his shorts on
[1:53:26] stumbling out of bed. Knocked over and
[1:53:29] broke I think a a table and stuff was
[1:53:32] strewing around.
[1:53:34] And beside his bed is sleeping pills.
[1:53:39] quite a large bottle of them. Helium,
[1:53:43] which they've outlawed here in Canada,
[1:53:45] outlawed in the States, outlawed in
[1:53:47] Britain, because it actually destroys
[1:53:49] your mind.
[1:53:52] And I looked at the bottle,
[1:53:55] 200
[1:53:56] pills.
[1:53:59] I even had that prescribed to me years
[1:54:01] ago for a trip to overseas. And my
[1:54:03] doctor who trusts me implicitly never
[1:54:07] gave me over 30.
[1:54:11] Said, "Who is this man
[1:54:14] who's accredited by the college of
[1:54:17] physicians and surgeons and give this
[1:54:20] man 200 sleeping pills?"
[1:54:26] He was laying on the floor. We had to
[1:54:27] call an ambulance and rush him to the
[1:54:30] hospital.
[1:54:31] become dependent on it.
[1:54:34] I asked a man once, "How many of these
[1:54:36] have you taken?" Another case, I grabbed
[1:54:39] his prescription. I says, "How many of
[1:54:41] these have you taken?" He says, "Four."
[1:54:45] I looked at the I I I looked at the the
[1:54:48] date on the on the thing. Looked on the
[1:54:51] date that we were at now. He had taken
[1:54:53] 29.
[1:54:55] Enough to put a person right out and
[1:54:58] maybe out of this life into another
[1:55:00] life. Who is this doctor? Who is this
[1:55:03] man that you're trusting? I sooner die
[1:55:07] and trust God.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; You got a pain, take a pill. It's not
[1:55:16] against my religion. But if that starts
[1:55:18] to make you drift away from the
[1:55:21] confidence in God, the confidence of the
[1:55:24] supernatural, if it start to destroy
[1:55:27] your faith, I would do away with it
[1:55:29] immediately. and I'd suffer the
[1:55:31] consequence.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, Brother Bisco, you don't know the
[1:55:35] pain. I know the pain of a slip disc
[1:55:37] that comes against the spinal cord, so I
[1:55:39] can't even hold my book. I can't hold my
[1:55:41] Bible. I can't preach a service. I'm
[1:55:43] laying with my arm over my head in
[1:55:45] excruciating pain. They said, "We'll
[1:55:48] take you right in. Here's morphine." And
[1:55:50] I had to I have the morphine bottle yet
[1:55:53] with a doctor's note on it so I can pass
[1:55:55] across borders. I took three of them and
[1:55:58] he told me, "These are very addictive.
[1:56:01] That's it.
[1:56:03] Forget it. I'm not going to become
[1:56:05] dependent on this thing.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; I'll spike my way through 7 weeks. Lost
[1:56:12] lost 10 lbs in two weeks from the sheer
[1:56:15] pain of it."
[1:56:17] We know a little bit about pain. Not a
[1:56:19] whole lot, but a little bit. But I know
[1:56:22] one thing more.
[1:56:24] while sitting in a tub of hot water just
[1:56:27] to get some relief, not intending to say
[1:56:30] anything more than a little short
[1:56:32] prayer, looked up to God, said, "God,
[1:56:36] if thou wilt, thou can make me whole."
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; I never intended on saying one more
[1:56:43] word, but it was like a rut of some
[1:56:46] supernatural thing went through me, and
[1:56:49] my own mouth spoke, I will be thou
[1:56:51] whole. I stood here in this in this
[1:56:56] pullpit and said to you that's what God
[1:56:59] said. I didn't say it. He said it.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; And if he said it, he's the one who has
[1:57:04] to do it. I don't have to make it
[1:57:06] happen. He has to make it happen.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Two weeks later, walked right into Dr.
[1:57:12] Chan's office, a neurosurgeon who is who
[1:57:14] has conducted 800 plus operations on the
[1:57:18] neck, spinal operations, a specialist. I
[1:57:22] said, "Book me in."
[1:57:25] Out of his own mouth, he said, "There is
[1:57:27] no other remedy for you." Two weeks
[1:57:29] earlier, there's no remedy. We have to
[1:57:31] go in. We have to remove it. We have to
[1:57:33] take that. What's left? I have to suck
[1:57:35] that out. He said, "We put the two I
[1:57:37] take a bone out of your hip or take a
[1:57:38] cow bone and I have to I have to fuse
[1:57:41] those together and that's the only way
[1:57:43] he that's what came out of his mouth."
[1:57:45] Two weeks later, he said, "Sign this
[1:57:47] right here and I'll put you in the first
[1:57:49] bed. Emergency operation." I I signed
[1:57:52] it.
[1:57:54] Two weeks later,
[1:57:56] I said
[1:57:58] I cancel that.
[1:58:00] No, I I'd said that earlier. I asked
[1:58:02] them earlier to cancel it. They said,
[1:58:04] "That's the only way." So, two weeks
[1:58:06] later, I went in. I said, "Book
[1:58:09] me as soon as you can possibly get me
[1:58:12] in. Book me in." He said, "But how are
[1:58:14] you?" I said, "Well, I'm the same. I've
[1:58:16] lost 10 pounds in the last two weeks. If
[1:58:18] that's any answer," he said, "but how
[1:58:21] are you?" I said, "Well, I'm I'm the
[1:58:22] same." He said, "Well, maybe you should
[1:58:24] wait."
[1:58:26] He's the one saying now. He refused to
[1:58:28] asked him three times formally take me
[1:58:30] in and do the operation because I felt I
[1:58:34] needed to just put the word of God to
[1:58:35] the test. Not tempting him, just put it
[1:58:38] to the test.
[1:58:41] Three times he refused. When I walked
[1:58:44] out, I was just going to my car. I was
[1:58:47] going down the sidewalk.
[1:58:50] I looked at my wife who was on this side
[1:58:51] of me. I remember like it was yesterday.
[1:58:53] I said to her, "Something just
[1:58:56] happened." I said, "I feel like I've
[1:58:58] just taken a step about 25%." I said,
[1:59:01] "About 25% to my healing."
[1:59:04] And it was 7 weeks from that time. But I
[1:59:08] knew that God had spoken it. And I said
[1:59:10] here over this pulpit, for those of you
[1:59:11] that here, I said, "God didn't say be
[1:59:13] improved."
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; God did not say be better. He said be
[1:59:18] whole.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:21] And I'm here tonight to witness this
[1:59:23] afternoon that that God is still a God
[1:59:25] that speaks. That's that's a God that
[1:59:28] spoke to you, Brother David Law. That's
[1:59:30] a God that spoke to you. That's a God
[1:59:31] that spoke to you, Brother Ken Bookho.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; That's a God that speaks. I feel like
[1:59:42] giving him glory. Amen.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Our grandson Joel just had a birthday.
[1:59:52] I said to my wife,
[1:59:55] she always keeps a little Hallmark
[1:59:57] calendar.
[1:59:59] I said, "Find the find the little
[2:00:02] calendar." When we were in India, I
[2:00:05] remember it like it was yesterday. I
[2:00:07] walked over and I knelt in my bed and
[2:00:10] had my Bible open and just a voice and I
[2:00:13] just spoke it. I said, and she's sitting
[2:00:14] in the corner reading her Bible and I
[2:00:17] said, "We'll have another grandson. His
[2:00:20] name will be Joel." March the 10th
[2:00:24] of 1984.
[2:00:31] One week later,
[2:00:33] his granddaddy, Brother Tom Ray, and
[2:00:35] they're in Phoenix today having
[2:00:36] meetings. But one week later, the note
[2:00:39] on that Saturday is Tom's dad died
[2:00:42] today.
[2:00:45] Died suddenly. They couldn't get him to
[2:00:46] the hospital fast enough. Just at 59
[2:00:49] years old.
[2:00:51] And Joanne was not feeling real well and
[2:00:55] she went to the doctor
[2:00:57] on that day when her when her
[2:01:00] father-in-law died and he said, "You're
[2:01:03] pregnant."
[2:01:05] One week later, I'm kneeling in India.
[2:01:08] We're not even home yet. I gave it to
[2:01:11] Joel. I photocopied it and enlarged it.
[2:01:15] I want you to keep this.
[2:01:17] The God that said that has something in
[2:01:20] his mind.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, the angel that
[2:01:25] led you here, I have so much more I want
[2:01:27] to say, but the angel that led you here,
[2:01:30] he has a plan.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Don't give up.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Don't surrender up your conviction.
[2:01:36] Don't surrender up. Don't loosen up.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Not in this age. Not in this time.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Young people, don't bend for anything.
[2:01:43] Don't bend for anything that's around.
[2:01:45] None of your peers, none of your
[2:01:47] friendship, none of the suggestion. Make
[2:01:49] your atmosphere in the house of God and
[2:01:52] around the believers. I say that to
[2:01:54] everyone.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; I have no apology for what I spoke this
[2:01:58] morning.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; No apology whatsoever.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; I believe it's the absolute truth of
[2:02:02] God's word.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; And remember, one thing that won't cut
[2:02:06] it with God is I'm this way or I'm doing
[2:02:08] this because of that. That's not the
[2:02:11] reason.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; That's called the blame game. And we're
[2:02:14] not into that.
[2:02:16] And it didn't work with Adam. It didn't
[2:02:18] work with Eve.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; And it didn't work with Aaron.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; He said, you know, the people are given
[2:02:24] over to this mischief.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Blamed it on the people.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; The people are are after this. You know,
[2:02:31] the people are desiring something. So, I
[2:02:33] just gave into it. The Bible says, I
[2:02:36] haven't got time. We're already through
[2:02:38] our The Bible says that Aaron told them
[2:02:42] specifically, "Break off your earrings
[2:02:45] of your wives and your daughters and
[2:02:47] your sons and put them in the fire." And
[2:02:50] the Bible says he he graved, he made,
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; he actually constructed this image. It
[2:02:57] came out.
[2:02:59] But when it was all over, and the Bible
[2:03:01] says this,
[2:03:05] the Bible says when Moses came down,
[2:03:08] Joshua, he couldn't get the sound. He
[2:03:10] thought they're having a revival.
[2:03:13] They're rejoicing. This is the sound of
[2:03:15] victory.
[2:03:17] Moses, that old prophet, no, he said,
[2:03:21] "This is not the sound of them that have
[2:03:24] gotten the victory. This is not the
[2:03:26] sound of them who've been defeated.
[2:03:29] and he come down
[2:03:31] and the Bible says it's very curious
[2:03:35] says and Moses saw their nakedness
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; and he saw that Aaron had made them
[2:03:42] naked and the word for nakedness is that
[2:03:45] the restraints were given over.
[2:03:49] Aaron gave in to their desire and made
[2:03:54] them naked before God. the restraints
[2:03:56] were gone. And when I I saw that, I
[2:03:59] said, "God, I'm going to come to the
[2:04:02] altar today, and I'm going to come to
[2:04:03] the pulpit today, and I'm going to come
[2:04:05] to the platform today, say, the
[2:04:07] restraints need to stay in force. The
[2:04:10] restraints need to be reestablished."
[2:04:13] And mothers and fathers, if you've
[2:04:15] allowed it to be loosened up because of
[2:04:17] the pressure of the school or the
[2:04:18] pressure of the children or the pressure
[2:04:20] of my work or the pressure of something
[2:04:22] else, don't play the blame game. Don't
[2:04:24] allow those restraints to be loosened
[2:04:26] up.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Strengthen them.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; And this morning is a morning of
[2:04:32] repentance. Say, "I repent before God.
[2:04:35] I'm not going to go that direction
[2:04:37] anymore."
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; You'll find one day in eternity that
[2:04:43] what I'm saying today here is absolutely
[2:04:45] the truth. And now it's not on my hands
[2:04:48] anymore. It's on yours.
[2:04:51] God's going to ask you one day. I
[2:04:53] declare before God, God's going to ask
[2:04:55] you one day, what did you do with that
[2:04:58] service?
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; You think I put my servant through all
[2:05:04] twisted up nervous feeling and studying
[2:05:07] before God seven days a week, not six
[2:05:10] days or five days, go on Sunday and go
[2:05:13] on Monday and all day Saturday and
[2:05:15] barely squeeze a little time off to be
[2:05:17] able to deliver this to you. and you're
[2:05:19] going to sit there and just say, "Well,
[2:05:21] ho, how I'mma take it if I want to take
[2:05:22] it, or I got some other idea." Your idea
[2:05:24] won't wash with God.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; God's not interested in your reasoning.
[2:05:29] He's not interested in your excuses.
[2:05:31] He's not interested in your
[2:05:32] circumstances because God is greater
[2:05:35] than all of those things. What are we
[2:05:36] going to say? I'm caught in a certain
[2:05:38] situation. I'm caught in a certain and
[2:05:40] God's not big enough to deliver me.
[2:05:45] Who is your God?
[2:05:48] Your God isn't the God of this message.
[2:05:49] Then
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; your God isn't the God of the prophet.
[2:05:53] Your God's not the God of Abraham,
[2:05:54] Isaac, and Jacob. It's some other God.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; But this God is able to deliver out of
[2:06:01] any situation.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; And I look for him to do so.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; I say, glory be to God.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Our God is a mighty God.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; This is a God of Moses. This a God of
[2:06:17] Elijah. This is a God and father of our
[2:06:20] Lord Jesus Christ whose spirit raised
[2:06:22] him up out of the dead. This is a God
[2:06:24] that's going to change your body.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; This is a God that's going to raise him
[2:06:28] out of this the sleeping out of the
[2:06:31] earth. This is a God. And if we haven't
[2:06:33] got that God, I don't care what our
[2:06:35] circumstance is.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; I don't care what your situation is,
[2:06:39] physical, mental, financial, or any
[2:06:42] other way. We are not depending upon the
[2:06:45] arm of the flesh.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; Especially when those situations get us
[2:06:50] driftest further and we become more
[2:06:52] distant from God, more distant from this
[2:06:55] holy godly way. I say return to the
[2:06:59] Lord.
[2:07:00] [Music]
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; To this whole congregation of Bible way,
[2:07:04] return. Some of you men, some of you
[2:07:07] fathers made weak, lame excuses. You
[2:07:10] ought to repent. You ought to fall on
[2:07:12] your face before God this morning and
[2:07:14] say, "I repent. I return to this God of
[2:07:18] Elijah. I return back to this God of the
[2:07:22] word." I've heard such lame excuses of
[2:07:25] the women. You are why you are because
[2:07:27] of something. I've heard them say, "Uh,
[2:07:30] I get headaches from long hair." I say,
[2:07:32] "Repent."
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Repent.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; There's a message for repentance.
[2:07:40] Not a message to be heard and go out and
[2:07:42] forget what you heard. It's a message to
[2:07:44] say, I changed. I turn around.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; I'm turning around.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to obey. I'm going
[2:07:51] to heed the voice of God.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; You think I'm singing? I'm I'm preaching
[2:07:57] this for my own satisfaction. Far from
[2:08:00] it. I'd far far sooner be somewhere
[2:08:03] else. I'd far sooner have my feet up
[2:08:06] someplace else. I'd far sooner have a
[2:08:08] day off saying this because it's truth
[2:08:12] and because it must be spoken. It must
[2:08:14] be said.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; You can't pass it off on the husband or
[2:08:20] the wife or the parents or the young
[2:08:22] people. You can't pass it off
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; cuz God won't hear it. I'm here to tell
[2:08:27] you God won't honor it. God will not
[2:08:30] acknowledge it at all. Say, "Well, it's
[2:08:32] because of this or because of that." God
[2:08:34] won't honor it. While those things may
[2:08:37] be true,
[2:08:39] I've been called serpent seat. I've been
[2:08:42] called the kind old priest. I've been
[2:08:44] called every kind of dastardly thing. I
[2:08:47] had two phone calls this last week. Left
[2:08:50] long messages and they are so insane.
[2:08:54] Completely way off calling brother
[2:08:56] Brandon, brother Brandon, Brother Bisl,
[2:08:58] brother Bisco. I mean, they're way off
[2:09:00] into some insane place. and and and it
[2:09:04] troubled me and I knew it was some evil
[2:09:08] spirit
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; cuz I woke up very early in the morning
[2:09:11] about 4.
[2:09:14] You think this is not supernatural
[2:09:15] friends? I'm talking about supernatural
[2:09:17] God. I experience it every week.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; And I was troubled. I'd had a dream. The
[2:09:25] dream doesn't mean anything to you.
[2:09:26] Meant very little to me. But I was
[2:09:28] troubled.
[2:09:30] So, I got up and walked into my office
[2:09:34] to do something.
[2:09:36] While I was standing there, I saw the
[2:09:37] light on my phone. I thought, "That's
[2:09:40] strange.
[2:09:42] I didn't remember hearing the phone
[2:09:43] ring."
[2:09:45] And that light wasn't on when we got
[2:09:46] home from our visitation,
[2:09:49] but I'll I'll I better see what it is.
[2:09:52] It might be an emergency.
[2:09:54] a female young woman's voice came on
[2:10:00] and she began. It wasn't even she wasn't
[2:10:03] coherent in her thoughts. She was
[2:10:06] completely
[2:10:08] in insane
[2:10:11] condition.
[2:10:12] Completely insane.
[2:10:15] And I listen to every word
[2:10:18] she's been in this church.
[2:10:22] She's heard the message like you all
[2:10:24] hear the message.
[2:10:27] But somehow, and I'm sure I don't know
[2:10:29] who she is exactly, I have my ideas.
[2:10:34] I think she even held some position in
[2:10:38] the church.
[2:10:41] Somewhere along the line,
[2:10:44] something crept in
[2:10:47] and just began she began to drift.
[2:10:52] There's no end to that drifting,
[2:10:54] friends.
[2:10:56] I tell you, before God, it ends up in
[2:10:59] some dark abyss.
[2:11:02] And I doubt if even a good gospel
[2:11:05] message right now could reach her short
[2:11:06] of God giving her some sanity back in
[2:11:09] her mind.
[2:11:11] And she talks about brother Brandham
[2:11:15] and she goes off into Nostradamus
[2:11:19] off into astrology back down here again
[2:11:23] and into the into what she's heard and
[2:11:26] then she's picking out some dates and
[2:11:28] talking about a child she has and makes
[2:11:32] all kinds of incoherent references back
[2:11:36] and forth and talk. She's fluent. She's
[2:11:38] she's she's fluent.
[2:11:41] She's intelligent. Very intelligent
[2:11:46] and way off into some dark place.
[2:11:51] God,
[2:11:54] I hope there isn't a man or a woman
[2:11:59] or a young person that's sitting here
[2:12:00] today
[2:12:02] that ends up where she is.
[2:12:06] Only the grace of God could even find
[2:12:08] her and bring her back.
[2:12:11] And right in the middle of her
[2:12:12] conversation, in comes a four-letter
[2:12:14] word.
[2:12:16] That unclean demon speaking out of her
[2:12:20] mouth. Oh God, in the place she's headed
[2:12:24] right now, friends, even where she is,
[2:12:28] be like a millennium to where she's
[2:12:30] going, short of the grace of God.
[2:12:36] Is that necessary? Was it necessary for
[2:12:38] her to be there? I don't believe so.
[2:12:41] But somewhere along the line, I'm
[2:12:44] closing.
[2:12:45] Brother Brandham says, and he says it
[2:12:48] for a reason,
[2:12:49] you can believe in predestination all
[2:12:51] you want, but he says this, it's not
[2:12:54] easy to go to hell.
[2:12:58] Says you have to fight over your
[2:13:00] conscience.
[2:13:01] There was something down in here.
[2:13:04] Even when you were allowing it, even
[2:13:06] when you took that first step to loosen
[2:13:08] up and go, just when you were loosening
[2:13:11] it up and and and saying, "Well, because
[2:13:13] of this and because of that, because all
[2:13:15] you're doing, that's the blame game. And
[2:13:17] because of that, that does not justify
[2:13:20] this.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; It doesn't doesn't justify this
[2:13:23] movement. That might be so. Maybe they
[2:13:25] did say that. Maybe they did act that
[2:13:27] way. Maybe your husband, your wife or
[2:13:29] whatever more, your family, your
[2:13:30] children, who knows who it is, your
[2:13:32] employer, whatever your finances or your
[2:13:35] body, your sickness or whatever more.
[2:13:36] You could even say, "Why God did you
[2:13:38] allow this?" That will not suffice
[2:13:42] for making a step sideways,
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; making a step away from the things of
[2:13:47] God.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Return,
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; I say in the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:13:52] return back to the God of our fathers.
[2:13:56] For God sent Elijah to send you back to
[2:13:59] him.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; And what you have here is a life.
[2:14:03] It'll all pass.
[2:14:06] It's nothing but a vapor.
[2:14:09] You got a home. I guarantee you it'll be
[2:14:12] ashes one day.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; You got a nice car out here. You got a
[2:14:17] bank account that's worth nothing and
[2:14:19] getting to be worth less every day.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; You got a secure job. God could take
[2:14:23] your health tomorrow. You wouldn't have
[2:14:24] anything.
[2:14:37] If you can't say God is my keeper,
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; God is my God
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; and I'm serving him with everything, all
[2:14:44] the ferveny of my soul.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; I say return to him in the name of Jesus
[2:14:51] Christ.
[2:14:53] We'll bow our heads.
[2:15:02] Father,
[2:15:04] you're so holy,
[2:15:08] so righteous.
[2:15:10] Your presence is so sacred.
[2:15:13] I feel unworthy,
[2:15:16] unworthy to even stand near that
[2:15:18] presence.
[2:15:20] But we are here. I am here. These people
[2:15:22] are here because we heard a voice.
[2:15:27] We are here as I've declared earlier
[2:15:30] because your angel,
[2:15:33] your angel,
[2:15:35] I know something of that angel.
[2:15:38] I've sat in the divine presence
[2:15:42] with your prophet and your servant.
[2:15:45] I've looked into eyes that reach down
[2:15:48] into my soul,
[2:15:50] down into the most inner secret parts of
[2:15:53] my soul.
[2:15:55] And Lord, you are the same God now.
[2:15:59] And I know that you have spoken. You've
[2:16:00] spoken very explicitly.
[2:16:03] And I'm praying that there will not be a
[2:16:06] man, woman, or child
[2:16:08] that shall procrastinate
[2:16:11] or put off to another day which day may
[2:16:13] never come for them. But that now,
[2:16:16] today, even now, as you not only have
[2:16:20] spoken, but are speaking, that there
[2:16:23] will be
[2:16:25] a most sincere and deep work done by the
[2:16:30] Holy Spirit of God into hearts. Oh Lord,
[2:16:35] I pray that you'll come with a sword of
[2:16:37] the spirit and cut away this world and
[2:16:42] all of its enchantments,
[2:16:44] all of its stimulants, oh God, whatever
[2:16:47] they might be. Move us from them,
[2:16:49] Father, and let us walk in the midst of
[2:16:52] this world
[2:16:54] in robes of white,
[2:16:57] untainted.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Un unaffected by it. Lord, there's
[2:17:03] families here. There's parents here. And
[2:17:06] I don't know what you're going to call
[2:17:07] on them to do, but you're calling on
[2:17:11] young men and women to give themselves
[2:17:16] to give themselves so completely, so
[2:17:18] surrendered to you, Lord, that their
[2:17:21] time goes through a new adjustment.
[2:17:24] Their day has they they'll have another
[2:17:27] agenda. And oh God, help us that
[2:17:31] minister, our brother John Andy's that
[2:17:32] will be ministering tonight. Lord, I
[2:17:35] pray you'll send a flame from his mouth.
[2:17:39] And oh God, I ask that your word this
[2:17:43] morning will find its resting place into
[2:17:46] good ground.
[2:17:48] Lord, let it bring forth fruit.
[2:17:51] I don't need any credit. I don't need
[2:17:53] any accolade. I don't need any thank
[2:17:56] you. My reward will be, Lord, as I see
[2:18:01] you work in the lives
[2:18:03] of your people.
[2:18:06] And if this message thins us out,
[2:18:09] so be it.
[2:18:12] If this message increases our numbers,
[2:18:14] so be it. We're not here for popularity.
[2:18:19] We're not here to have the best or the
[2:18:21] biggest. We're here, oh God,
[2:18:24] to have a people that'll be ready. ready
[2:18:27] in that hour when you call us.
[2:18:33] When you call us, Lord, we want to hear
[2:18:34] just once more.
[2:18:37] Well done. Enter in, oh God.
[2:18:43] Well done.
[2:18:45] Enter in. I'm speaking what is
[2:18:49] so real on my own heart so often.
[2:18:54] Oh God, by your grace,
[2:18:57] by your unconditional covenant, I pray
[2:19:00] you'll exercise it upon the people
[2:19:03] today.
[2:19:05] And forgive us for our backslidings.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; We'll name it for what it is. Forgive us
[2:19:12] for our wewardness. And you even spoke
[2:19:14] to your own people, your own children.
[2:19:15] You asked them, "Why? Why do you turn
[2:19:18] away?
[2:19:19] Return.
[2:19:21] Return."
[2:19:23] And I pray, oh God, that that will be
[2:19:27] what takes place now. Let your word now
[2:19:30] be confirmed with the these signs
[2:19:32] following
[2:19:34] Jesus Christ in your name.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:51] I wonder if you're not ashamed.
[2:19:56] You're not ashamed of this gospel.
[2:20:00] And I just want those that God has
[2:20:03] spoken to very very directly and I want
[2:20:06] you to identify yourself by saying
[2:20:09] I'm
[2:20:12] I am now prepared under God
[2:20:16] to make a turnaround of repentance in my
[2:20:19] life and I do so I fear lest anyone
[2:20:25] would harden themselves against that
[2:20:28] kind of invitation.
[2:20:30] But only if God has been dealing and
[2:20:32] speaking to you as such. And you must
[2:20:35] forget about who's next to you or who's
[2:20:38] around you or what what people think of
[2:20:40] you. It's what God thinks of you. And he
[2:20:44] loves you enough to speak to you and to
[2:20:47] come to you now once again. And perhaps
[2:20:50] you'd like to stand.
[2:20:52] The only song I can think of just now,
[2:20:55] Linda, is I surrender all
[2:20:58] all to Jesus. I surrender
[2:21:02] all
[2:21:05] to Jesus.
[2:21:09] I
[2:21:11] surrender
[2:21:14] all
[2:21:16] to him.
[2:21:19] I freely.
[2:21:26] I
[2:21:28] will forever
[2:21:34] and trust you
[2:21:37] in
[2:21:39] his presence
[2:21:43] they
[2:21:45] live.
[2:21:48] I
[2:21:50] [Music]
[2:22:01] surrender
[2:22:04] all
[2:22:06] [Music]
[2:22:12] to the
[2:22:15] blessing.
[2:22:18] [Music]
[2:22:21] I
[2:22:23] surrender.
[2:22:25] [Music]
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; All that I have, all
[2:22:33] that.
[2:22:38] Oh,
[2:22:41] [Music]
[2:22:44] all
[2:22:46] I
[2:22:48] ever
[2:22:55] [Applause]
[2:22:59] [Music]
[2:23:11] to the
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; I wonder before we sing this song again.
[2:23:19] All that I have and you'll mean every
[2:23:22] word of it.
[2:23:24] I only
[2:23:26] would have those that would care to come
[2:23:29] forward that let me be very specific. We
[2:23:32] don't have room for everyone and you
[2:23:34] don't need to necessarily come here. But
[2:23:37] those that God has spoken to say I am
[2:23:40] not where
[2:23:43] I am in a backsliden condition. I'm
[2:23:46] before God. I am engaged in. I have
[2:23:50] drifted far
[2:23:52] from the mark. I'm not where I used to
[2:23:55] be, but I desire to be there. And I want
[2:23:59] to give I want to attest to this
[2:24:02] congregation. I want to show this
[2:24:05] congregation
[2:24:07] that I am making a a a decision under
[2:24:11] God and under this word as evidence that
[2:24:15] the Holy Spirit has spoken to me. I'm
[2:24:17] going to come and dedicate myself and
[2:24:20] give myself unreservedly
[2:24:23] to this Christ. And I'm sorry. I'm
[2:24:28] sorry. I have a repentance in my heart.
[2:24:30] I have a godly sorrow. I want to serve
[2:24:33] him. I've been not even laxidasical.
[2:24:37] I've been wewarded in my life,
[2:24:41] oh God. And you you desire the prayers
[2:24:45] of the people
[2:24:47] and the mercy and grace of God upon your
[2:24:51] life. And if you are that one,
[2:24:56] come and stand and make that
[2:24:59] declaration.
[2:25:00] He stood openly for you and we need to
[2:25:04] stand openly for him. Confession is good
[2:25:07] for the soul. There's no way if you're
[2:25:09] going to take that kind of stand in a
[2:25:12] congregation of the believers, let it be
[2:25:15] seen right at the present, right at the
[2:25:17] right at the opening of your decision.
[2:25:20] Let it be declared. I'm here to declare
[2:25:23] it before God, before man and the world
[2:25:27] in the name of Jesus Christ. All that I
[2:25:30] have. And then I'm going to pray. There
[2:25:33] will not be another invitation.
[2:25:35] All that I have.
[2:25:42] [Applause]
[2:25:43] [Music]
[2:25:51] worthy
[2:26:01] [Music]
[2:26:10] surrender.
[2:26:11] [Music]
[2:26:14] All that I have.
[2:26:18] [Music]
[2:26:30] worthy
[2:26:36] can I
[2:26:44] go
[2:26:48] [Music]
[2:26:51] to the
[2:26:55] with everyone reverently.
[2:26:58] Father, I trust that you are pleased
[2:27:01] with
[2:27:02] what you are seeing.
[2:27:06] Some are responding, others need to.
[2:27:11] But these who willingly
[2:27:14] have come,
[2:27:16] they're making a serious admission and a
[2:27:19] serious step.
[2:27:22] Oh God, I believe they are saying with
[2:27:25] their footsteps down here.
[2:27:29] Father,
[2:27:31] you have spoken. I have heard your
[2:27:33] voice. It has tenderly called me. You
[2:27:37] have wooed me by your spirit so
[2:27:41] tenderly. You woo me and brewed over me
[2:27:45] that I might bring forth that life, that
[2:27:48] perfect reflection of Jesus Christ. Oh
[2:27:51] Lord, do it. And I am praying, oh God,
[2:27:53] in the name of Jesus Christ, that every
[2:27:56] obstacle in the lives of these who are
[2:27:58] standing will be removed from them. Oh
[2:28:01] God, may the fire of God come, I pray,
[2:28:05] and separate them, oh God, from every
[2:28:07] hindrance. I pray, I ask that this
[2:28:10] morning will be a morning, a decisive
[2:28:12] time, oh God. Let it be a decisive
[2:28:15] decision. Let there be nothing in heaven
[2:28:18] or the world or hell itself that can
[2:28:21] change their mind or change their
[2:28:23] thought. Come and strengthen, I pray.
[2:28:25] Strengthen the bonds, oh God. Strengthen
[2:28:28] the tie. Strengthen, oh God, the the
[2:28:31] anchor. I pray the anchor holes, oh God.
[2:28:34] We can say the anchor holes. We can say
[2:28:36] to them, cast yourself upon the Lord
[2:28:39] Jesus Christ and he will carry you
[2:28:42] through. There is nothing that can move
[2:28:44] them. Lord, let their faith, I pray, let
[2:28:47] their old unbelief depart. Let it depart
[2:28:50] in the name of Jesus Christ. I come
[2:28:52] against that demon of doubt.
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; Let the people of God I need now. I need
[2:28:59] now your unity. Let the demon of doubt
[2:29:02] be bound in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:29:06] And let him be cast out of the the
[2:29:08] people, the hearts that have given him
[2:29:10] place. Let him be removed
[2:29:13] in Jesus name. In the almighty name of
[2:29:16] Jesus, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
[2:29:19] Jacob.
[2:29:21] Oh God, we are here, Lord, not on some
[2:29:24] kind of entertainment, but we're here to
[2:29:28] do business. We're here to see men and
[2:29:31] women
[2:29:32] chart the course towards eternal life.
[2:29:37] Oh God, let the voice, oh God, give my
[2:29:42] give me breath to cry out.
[2:29:46] Give the people hearts to believe.
[2:29:50] Let them be souls spoken to today that
[2:29:53] nothing will be able to move them from
[2:29:55] the decision they make. Let the husbands
[2:29:58] go home and say to their wives, "Honey,
[2:30:00] it's going to be different."
[2:30:03] We're setting up time around God around
[2:30:06] his word.
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; It's going to be different.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; I'm going to demonstrate by the grace of
[2:30:13] God, the very life and leadership of the
[2:30:16] Holy Spirit in our home. Let the wife
[2:30:20] with dedication
[2:30:22] come and say, "It's going to be
[2:30:24] different. It's going to be different.
[2:30:26] I'm going to seek to follow the pattern
[2:30:28] of the godly women of the scriptures.
[2:30:32] to be those that are identified in
[2:30:34] Hebrews 11.
[2:30:37] Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
[2:30:41] Oh God. We're a needy people. We're a
[2:30:44] needy people.
[2:30:46] We're living here in Satan's Eden. But
[2:30:49] we're living here in the most glorious
[2:30:51] age that you've ever given man to live
[2:30:54] in.
[2:30:56] You'll demonstrate your power.
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; You'll demonstrate your power in your
[2:31:00] people.
[2:31:02] and you'll demonstrate your victory over
[2:31:04] death itself.
[2:31:06] We praise your name. We praise your
[2:31:08] name.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; Let's everyone stand, shall we, please?
[2:31:12] I will praise him. I will praise him.
[2:31:15] Praise the lamb for sinner slain. Give
[2:31:18] him glory all ye people. For his blood
[2:31:21] has washed each stain.
[2:31:24] I
[2:31:26] will praise. Just give him glory and
[2:31:29] thanksgiving. Now I
[2:31:33] will
[2:31:36] [Music]
[2:31:42] sinner slave.
[2:31:49] Oh,
[2:31:53] glory
[2:31:55] on ye
[2:31:58] [Music]
[2:32:01] for his blood has washed away.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; Let's all in the United Way now
[2:32:12] together.
[2:32:14] Hear
[2:32:18] these words, oh Lord.
[2:32:24] Oh God. Oh God,
[2:32:26] [Music]
[2:32:29] the lamb all sinners slain.
[2:32:34] [Music]
[2:32:40] Give him glory. Glory
[2:32:43] all ye people
[2:32:49] for his blood has washed out away.
[2:33:00] The anchor holds
[2:33:04] I'm singing this
[2:33:09] not to fill in time. And the service has
[2:33:11] gone long enough. And yet with God, he's
[2:33:14] not wearied
[2:33:17] with your confession. He's not wearied
[2:33:20] with your praise.
[2:33:23] And may well be that the Holy Spirit
[2:33:25] still
[2:33:27] tenderly wooing, brooding.
[2:33:30] Son, daughter,
[2:33:32] surrender. Give up all. Give up
[2:33:34] everything.
[2:33:36] Maybe he's wooing you to set a different
[2:33:38] course.
[2:33:42] Let me say to the young couples here,
[2:33:45] it doesn't take any hero to get married
[2:33:48] and then go off and live for yourself.
[2:33:50] But it takes a real brave son and
[2:33:53] daughter of God to say, "Our home is
[2:33:55] going to be a godly home. Our home's
[2:33:57] going to be an open home. Our lives are
[2:34:00] going to be given to the service of the
[2:34:02] bride of Jesus Christ. whatever we can
[2:34:05] do for them.
[2:34:07] And that's not a works program. That's
[2:34:10] the program of Jesus Christ. He lived
[2:34:13] for others. Are you willing to do that?
[2:34:15] Are you prepared to do that?
[2:34:20] [Music]
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; Are you prepared to do that?
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; It's a blessed life.
[2:34:29] It's a blessed life.
[2:34:33] What have you done, Brother Bisl?
[2:34:35] Well, you kids wouldn't know it. I
[2:34:37] peeled logs to build a church.
[2:34:43] I worked on the foundation of Little Log
[2:34:45] Church when I was alone. I hired one
[2:34:47] other man who was ungodly and left at
[2:34:49] noon. Went to the beer parlor, never
[2:34:51] came back.
[2:34:54] Many of you were in that log church.
[2:34:57] [Music]
[2:35:00] wasn't just standing behind the pulpit,
[2:35:04] worked with my hands.
[2:35:08] Your prophet who brought this message
[2:35:10] worked with his hands.
[2:35:13] He climbed telephone poles. He hung on
[2:35:16] to high tension lines and power lines.
[2:35:19] And that humbles me to think that he was
[2:35:21] willing to do that. Why was he willing
[2:35:23] to do that? Cuz he had a life to live, a
[2:35:25] life of service, a life to give.
[2:35:28] Let this congregation, if it be
[2:35:30] identified for anything else, let it be
[2:35:32] a a giving, a service to the Lord Jesus
[2:35:35] Christ. Do we have a yay and an amen?
[2:35:39] God bless you. God sees that.
[2:35:45] The anchor
[2:35:47] hold
[2:35:51] the in his mat.
[2:35:56] [Music]
[2:36:10] I am all
[2:36:14] I need.
[2:36:19] Praise
[2:36:22] the
[2:36:24] Lord.
[2:36:29] [Music]
[2:36:38] Oh
[2:36:40] my
[2:36:42] [Music]
[2:36:48] god.
[2:36:50] [Music]
[2:37:17] in spite of the storms. We're just going
[2:37:21] to sing it once more and I'm going to
[2:37:22] dismiss then after we sing it once more.
[2:37:25] You do whatever God tells you to do. If
[2:37:27] you want to spend time here, just kneel
[2:37:29] and pray. Spend time in your seat.
[2:37:32] That's fine. The message is over.
[2:37:37] [Music]
[2:37:55] I
[2:37:57] this this service was uh was a meant a
[2:38:01] lot for me. I just want to take it one
[2:38:02] more step. I just want to say I'm sorry
[2:38:04] to the body cuz it's Christ's body.
[2:38:08] [Music]
[2:38:11] Years ago, brother had prayed for me up
[2:38:13] front here. He says, "A man of great
[2:38:17] faith.
[2:38:19] I haven't felt it for years. I don't
[2:38:21] feel worthy of a statement like that."
[2:38:23] And and I I haven't felt that faith in
[2:38:28] my life.
[2:38:32] I want it back.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; This service is for me.
[2:38:39] I take the full step. I want the body to
[2:38:44] forgive me. I want that faith.
[2:38:49] [Music]
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; I have children here.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; Restore the Lord.
[2:39:00] that the Lord gave me.
[2:39:03] They're not serving him
[2:39:06] and he gave them to me.
[2:39:11] I was giving up.
[2:39:14] I was giving up.
[2:39:18] And he gave me this service.
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; Forgive me.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; I love you all and I love the Lord.
[2:39:29] After
[2:39:37] we've dismissed,
[2:39:39] we have brethren here, ministers,
[2:39:41] brother Tony and brother John.
[2:39:45] And if you desire prayer, you can just
[2:39:47] hold your hand and they'll come and pray
[2:39:49] with you.
[2:39:54] The anchor holds friends
[2:39:56] and the bride is coming through. She'll
[2:40:00] crest every wavel.
[2:40:02] The name of Jesus Christ
[2:40:06] in spite of the storm.
[2:40:09] [Music]
[2:40:19] Oh sh
[2:40:25] [Music]
[2:40:38] [Applause]
[2:40:39] my soul. Oh
[2:40:42] my
[2:40:47] [Music]
[2:40:49] se
[2:40:51] [Music]
[2:41:00] [Music]
[2:41:02] anor
[2:41:11] testimony.
[2:41:13] Let us be their testimony.
[2:41:16] [Music]
[2:41:18] Oh, as we march across
[2:41:22] our
[2:41:24] [Music]
[2:41:26] [Applause]
[2:41:28] [Music]
[2:41:35] face
[2:41:36] [Music]
[2:41:45] inside the soul.
[2:41:49] [Music]
[2:41:52] I'm going to close in prayer.
[2:41:54] I want to close with this statement. I
[2:41:57] would that everyone here take the
[2:42:00] service this morning with the utmost
[2:42:04] seriousness.
[2:42:06] I believe that for some God will not
[2:42:09] speak to you again this way.
[2:42:12] You want to take it with the utmost
[2:42:14] seriousness. If he's been speaking to
[2:42:16] you,
[2:42:18] I actually believe that some will never
[2:42:20] feel that pull again if you don't
[2:42:25] surrender to it this time. I've never
[2:42:28] said that in my life, but I believe that
[2:42:30] down in my soul, and I believe in before
[2:42:33] the throne of God, it will be true on
[2:42:36] that day.
[2:42:38] The spirit of God, the scripture says,
[2:42:42] "Behold, my spirit will not always
[2:42:45] strive with man."
[2:42:51] Dear Father,
[2:42:55] how merciful you are,
[2:42:59] how long-suffering.
[2:43:01] I've been so mindful of your
[2:43:03] longsuffering.
[2:43:06] But this world has perverted our thought
[2:43:12] into turning you into some dirty old
[2:43:15] grandfather as your prophet said,
[2:43:18] someone who has no principle. Someone
[2:43:22] who can be pushed any direction. That's
[2:43:25] not what you are.
[2:43:28] Your word has told us it's a fearful
[2:43:30] thing to fall into the hands of a living
[2:43:33] God. I want to fall into your loving
[2:43:36] arms, Lord. I don't want to fall in
[2:43:39] rebellion. I do not want to come and
[2:43:42] look into your eyes and know I resisted
[2:43:44] you. I turn to your side. Oh, I just
[2:43:46] thought that's some little preacher.
[2:43:48] That's some that's old brother Ed.
[2:43:49] That's his own thoughts and own ideas.
[2:43:52] Let it be known today, oh God, that it
[2:43:54] was a voice of the Holy Spirit speaking
[2:43:57] down into the very deep recesses. And
[2:43:59] that is why they even have that thought
[2:44:02] in their mind now because it is you. It
[2:44:06] is you. And the enemy would try to have
[2:44:07] them put it off. They'd like to have
[2:44:09] them slide it off and put it off on some
[2:44:12] other place. But I pray you'll bring
[2:44:14] home, oh God, bring home, I pray, to the
[2:44:18] heart, every heart, Lord, the reality of
[2:44:21] your word, the reality of your presence.
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; I thank you, Lord.
[2:44:29] And now for your faithfulness
[2:44:33] and your tender love and care for the
[2:44:35] sheep.
[2:44:36] I ask that you'll prepare us, oh God,
[2:44:39] for what else you have for us for today.
[2:44:43] And if you see fit to let us see this
[2:44:45] evening, for we know that condition of
[2:44:48] the world the way it's in, we could be
[2:44:50] gone at any moment. We could be gone at
[2:44:53] any time. And Lord, I I stand here
[2:44:56] before these people saying to you in
[2:44:59] prayer,
[2:45:01] not for our worthiness, but by your
[2:45:03] grace alone, we trust we shall stand
[2:45:06] there and hear your welcoming voice.
[2:45:10] Jesus, I commit this people to you, the
[2:45:13] words that now have been spoken. and to
[2:45:16] those that are
[2:45:19] in many places around the world just
[2:45:21] now. Lord, perhaps the saints in
[2:45:24] Switzerland, saints in New Zealand and
[2:45:26] in Europe, oh God, bless them, I pray
[2:45:30] abundantly.
[2:45:32] And if our little sister Merta is
[2:45:36] streaming,
[2:45:37] God touch and help that girl. Send
[2:45:41] somebody to be an encouragement to her.
[2:45:44] lead her, I pray, oh shepherd of the
[2:45:46] flock, I commit her to you in the name
[2:45:49] of Jesus Christ. Commit all of those
[2:45:52] that are have made a firm
[2:45:56] decision.
[2:45:57] Help them in their decision, Lord.
[2:45:59] Strengthen them in their resolve
[2:46:02] and send the Holy Spirit, I pray, to
[2:46:07] give them stamina and strength. Dismiss
[2:46:10] us now in your grace in Jesus Christ's
[2:46:12] name. Amen.
[2:46:15] God bless you. We dismiss you in Jesus
[2:46:17] Christ's name. We ask you to be
[2:46:20] reverent. Those you that are leaving,
[2:46:22] just leave reverently in Jesus name.
[2:46:28] The anchor.
[2:46:31] The anchor.
[2:46:36] You're dismissed.
[2:46:40] [Music]
[2:46:57] Hallelujah.
[2:46:59] [Music]
