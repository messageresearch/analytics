[12:27] prayer at this time. It's good to have
[12:29] our brother Kim Dingwall with us.
[12:31] Brother Kim, I'm going to ask you to
[12:32] come if you would and just open the
[12:33] service in a word of prayer. Couple of
[12:36] prayer requests. We want to
[12:39] remember Dorine. First, apparently she
[12:42] is Sister Sylvia Messages older sister
[12:46] and she she's in Honduras. She's asking
[12:48] prayer for um I guess their bookkeeper,
[12:51] their nephew was kidnapped and uh
[12:54] they're just asking that the Lord would
[12:57] release this young man. His name is
[13:00] Arnold. They want to they thank you very
[13:02] much for their prayers and also we want
[13:05] to uh remember brother Ernie Beva
[13:08] as he said brother JT Padet's church
[13:11] today
[13:13] couple of testimonies
[13:17] uh from sister from sister Victoria
[13:20] Adomora
[13:23] may the name of our Lord and Savior
[13:24] Jesus Christ we've glorified for his
[13:26] unfailing guidance provision and
[13:28] protection may He may he be blessed for
[13:32] his lovely sons and daughters who have
[13:33] used who he has used to bless me and my
[13:36] family. She says God bless you all.
[13:38] Amen. Sister Camela Camela has a prayer
[13:42] has a testimony. She wants to thank the
[13:44] Lord for helping her go through the
[13:46] worst of a bad case of flu. Brother DDA
[13:49] prayed for her. She's asking that we
[13:52] continue to pray for her that she would
[13:53] be continually made whole. Brother Hugh
[13:56] message just a quick word here. just
[13:58] wish he wants to thank the saints for
[14:00] prayer Wednesday evening. The Lord
[14:02] touched his body and he was fully
[14:04] restored to health and was able to go
[14:06] back to work on Thursday.
[14:09] Our sister Antuinette from Victoria just
[14:13] has a little note just grateful to the
[14:15] Lord Christ for all he has done
[14:18] particularly. She has uh helped her
[14:21] through school and helped her get a job
[14:22] after, but apparently she's not able to
[14:24] get all Sundays off. And when she can
[14:26] get the Sundays off, the devil comes and
[14:28] attacks her. She just wants to say
[14:31] thanks to be our Lord Jesus. We made it
[14:32] today. She just asking that we continue
[14:34] to remember her in prayer that she'd be
[14:37] able to continue making the services.
[14:39] Sister Mina, last Monday, she fell from
[14:42] a two to three foot lad step ladder flat
[14:46] on her back. She wants to thank the Lord
[14:47] that nothing seriously happened, but
[14:49] please pray for her that the Lord would
[14:51] continue to heal her all the way. So, we
[14:53] want to thank the Lord for these little
[14:54] little things that he's done. If you've
[14:56] got a need on your heart, just raise
[14:58] your hand as we go to prayer. If you're
[15:00] on the internet or on the telephone
[15:02] hookup, just count Brother Kim.
[15:14] Praise the Lord. This morning, I just
[15:15] want to take a moment to uh
[15:18] express my appreciation for the internet
[15:21] hookup and those that are involved with
[15:23] that. You know, I know what it's like to
[15:25] be involved sometimes in a church
[15:27] project and you're working with wires
[15:28] and you're working with computers and
[15:30] all those things and and it can be a lot
[15:32] of work and a lot of thankless work, but
[15:34] from the bottom of my heart, I want to
[15:36] express to everybody that's involved in
[15:38] the internet work and getting that out
[15:41] what a tremendous blessing. There's but
[15:43] there's been times I've been in a room
[15:44] full of people
[15:46] that are just worshiping and and and and
[15:48] receiving from God. And I'd like to be
[15:50] able to turn it around so that those
[15:51] that are doing it could see what an
[15:52] effect it's having on the outside. So I
[15:55] just pray God it be with you those that
[15:57] are involved with that and just I just
[15:58] want to appreciate just express my
[16:00] appreciation for that this morning.
[16:02] Let's bow our heads in prayer this
[16:04] morning.
[16:06] Kind heavenly father, we bow our hearts
[16:08] before you this morning, Lord. Lord, and
[16:11] we sang that song this morning when he
[16:13] reached down his hand for me. Lord, and
[16:16] we're just so thankful, Lord, that you
[16:18] continue to reach down your hand, Lord.
[16:21] Father, that you didn't only reach down
[16:22] your hand for me that 25 years ago,
[16:25] Lord, but you continually reach down for
[16:28] me, Lord Jesus.

[16:50] power.

[16:53] that we see you doing in our lives and
[16:56] moving among us, Lord, and healing our
[16:58] sick and

[17:03] such a wonderful God, Lord.

[17:34] and then we just want to sit at your

[27:54] &gt;&gt; So happy to see everyone. Another
[27:56] beautiful day.
[27:59] See the springtime speaks of
[28:01] resurrection.
[28:03] See the blossoms coming out on the
[28:06] trees.
[28:07] Some of the uh plum blossoms were
[28:11] blossoming this morning and speaks of
[28:14] life.
[28:15] We're not here because of
[28:19] some death as much as we're here because
[28:21] of life. Say, well, Jesus died, but the
[28:25] great thing is he rose again.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; The prophet said he proved who he was
[28:31] when he rose.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're here today because
[28:35] he has already proven who he is.
[28:39] Amen.
[28:41] Well, just a very very
[28:46] maybe three four weeks ago, I spoke of
[28:49] uh uh Sister Esther Shackleford here in
[28:53] the church. And this last week, she went
[28:56] into the presence of the Lord.
[28:59] I
[29:02] I thought a great deal. I've thought
[29:04] about her a lot uh this last week.
[29:08] And uh this is how I envisioned her in
[29:11] my mind. And perhaps you will get some
[29:14] picture of the of the sister.
[29:19] She was as a grand old ship,
[29:23] her masts
[29:25] proudly standing against the sky.
[29:29] anchored,
[29:31] steady,
[29:33] gently responding to the breezes,
[29:37] storms from time to time, but this grand
[29:41] old ship had seen it all before.
[29:46] Then the anchor was lifted
[29:49] and Sister Esther
[29:53] silently
[29:56] sailed off into the eternal haven of
[30:00] rest.
[30:02] And she certainly was that grand old
[30:04] ship.
[30:06] Year after year after year, you could
[30:10] just look in that direction and you know
[30:13] she'd be exactly the same.
[30:16] She was a large woman,
[30:19] but she would get her niece to drive.
[30:23] They would drive for hours
[30:26] from
[30:28] uh Lima all the way down to Murphy'sboro
[30:31] or other meetings.
[30:34] And uh at the ministry of the word,
[30:37] if you sit down and speak with her, her
[30:41] eyes would just flash with life. just
[30:45] glisten and sparkle.
[30:48] And oh, how I love to hear her sing. She
[30:50] had such a lovely voice. Just deep, rich
[30:55] voice. And even as well as I love to
[30:59] hear her sing and I think that she had a
[31:01] great love for
[31:04] my wife and I, uh, the last few years we
[31:07] couldn't convince her to sing. But I
[31:10] believe that angels are sitting back
[31:13] because none of them have a voice like
[31:14] she has.
[31:16] And uh probably hearing something new
[31:19] and fresh. Our sister Esther
[31:21] Shackleford, if you would this morning,
[31:24] I'd like you to remember
[31:26] her family. Uh Sister Faith Stoddard
[31:31] is her sister. And Sister Faith Stoddard
[31:34] was the penist at Bible believers uh in
[31:38] Limo, Ohio, where brother Isaiah Brooks
[31:42] is pastor now. And she was penis there
[31:44] for many, many years. And she played and
[31:48] Sister Tammy Laroo's sister played the
[31:50] organ. And so they're very, very close,
[31:54] especially to Sister Tammy has known her
[31:56] ever since. uh known sister Esther and
[32:00] Sister Faith ever since she was just a
[32:03] child.
[32:05] And then Sister Violet Brennan
[32:09] uh she is also sister
[32:12] and uh Sister Diana Kay is a niece and
[32:16] they've always been they've been very
[32:18] very close to ourselves personally and
[32:22] to the work and especially to Bible
[32:24] believers. Sister Esther Shackleford.
[32:28] And I sent I sent a note to brother Jeff
[32:30] Jenkins because he and uh brother I
[32:34] believe Ray Ericson took the memorial
[32:37] service yesterday.
[32:39] But Sister Esther Shackleford
[32:42] as soon as she heard that the message
[32:44] had reached into China, she was uh I
[32:47] would say the first person to speak to
[32:50] me about that work. And they had already
[32:54] been giving to a real good what they
[32:57] felt was a real good solid uh gospel
[33:01] minister who was did not know the
[33:04] message. The message hadn't reached him
[33:05] but they just wanted to reach the people
[33:07] of India with the gospel of Jesus Christ
[33:11] and they were already giving and
[33:13] supporting that work there.
[33:17] So it was not so much that sister Esther
[33:20] had such a burden for India but it was
[33:23] her love for the word. It was it was
[33:26] something that just spoke to your heart
[33:29] when you begin to speak to them speak to
[33:31] them about the scripture and they would
[33:32] stay after service just as long as you
[33:34] talk to them and preach to them after
[33:37] service. They just sit there and pull it
[33:39] out of you.
[33:41] It's just really really nice. And so,
[33:43] God bless the family and we'll certainly
[33:46] be remembering them.
[33:49] Amen. Well, uh, we've come here to hear
[33:53] the word and be ministered to.
[33:56] And let's pray that God will do
[33:59] everything that he has in mind to do in
[34:02] this service.
[34:04] Amen. I wonder if we could stand and uh
[34:09] I'd like to sing again. Uh, hear the cry
[34:12] of the shackled. Is that it?
[34:17] Yeah. It's 21 2119. So, you have it. I
[34:21] just love this song. Let's sing it as we
[34:24] getting ready to approach the word now.
[34:31] Hear the cry
[34:33] of the shackles
[34:38] of time.
[34:42] on his feet.
[34:45] [Music]
[34:48] See the tears
[34:50] of the broken,
[34:52] the cry
[34:54] of the slaves.
[34:56] [Music]
[34:57] No one
[35:00] set us free.
[35:05] Then the crying
[35:07] is still.
[35:09] The chorus
[35:11] rings out.
[35:14] The shackles
[35:16] leave from their chain.
[35:22] And the thousands
[35:24] of voices
[35:27] dwell in the song.
[35:31] Worthy
[35:33] where that was slain,
[35:39] worthy,
[35:44] worthy,
[35:48] worthy.
[35:50] The lamb that was slain.
[35:56] He's worthy.
[35:59] [Music]
[36:01] So worthy,
[36:02] [Music]
[36:06] worthy.
[36:07] The lamb
[36:09] that was slain.
[36:12] Then all the archangels,
[36:15] all the archangels,
[36:18] the saints of all time,
[36:23] holding
[36:25] their crowns in their hands.
[36:29] [Applause]
[36:31] Fall down
[36:33] before him
[36:36] joining
[36:37] the song.
[36:40] Worthy,
[36:42] worthy
[36:44] the lamb. Let's just worship him now.
[36:48] Worthy,
[36:50] [Music]
[36:53] worthy,
[36:57] worthy.
[36:58] [Music]
[37:01] That was
[37:06] worthy.
[37:09] So worthy. Worthy.
[37:12] So worthy, oh Lord. So worthy.
[37:16] [Music]
[37:22] You are indeed so worthy.
[37:25] Our hearts are filled,
[37:28] swelled to overflowing
[37:31] with praise and worship and honor.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; There is none other God
[37:38] &gt;&gt; to whom this honor is due.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; We owe you everything. We owe you all
[37:43] that we are, all that we ever can be. We
[37:47] lay our lives at your feet.
[37:50] We want to say today, lovely Lord Jesus,
[37:53] as we heard brother Kim Kim Dingwal
[37:57] express his
[37:59] love and appreciation to you, Lord,
[38:01] touch my heart. And I pray, Father, that
[38:05] each person,
[38:07] whatever state they are in as of this
[38:10] moment,
[38:11] they may look up into that
[38:14] lovely face of the resurrected Christ
[38:18] and recognize
[38:20] in their confession that when you were
[38:23] on the cross, we were on your mind.
[38:27] And there the shackles were broken.
[38:31] There the bodies were healed.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; There Satan and sin was defeated
[38:39] &gt;&gt; and we stand gloriously free this
[38:42] morning. Oh, glory to the lamb. Glory to
[38:46] the lamb of God.
[38:49] Thank you, Father, for the sacrifice.
[38:52] I pray that now you'll allow the Holy
[38:56] Spirit to move amongst us. And may that
[39:00] pillar of fire, oh God, I pray, be
[39:04] present. And may we sense the nearness,
[39:08] not only around us, but in us and
[39:11] through us. Permeate us, penetrate us,
[39:14] oh God.
[39:17] Move us. I pray that you'll move upon
[39:21] my being today, Lord, and thoughts.
[39:26] Cause my mouth to speak your words.
[39:29] Seal it, I pray, with the Holy Ghost.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; I pray that the seed will find good
[39:35] ground in the name of Jesus Christ. We
[39:39] depend upon your anointing now and
[39:42] humbly seek your grace and blessings in
[39:46] Jesus name. Amen.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. If you have your
[39:51] Bibles,
[39:53] turn with me to First Corinthians 2 and
[39:56] 12.
[40:05] Just reading that one verse and then I
[40:08] will
[40:11] read out of second Peter the first
[40:14] chapter
[40:23] 1 Corinthians 2:12 12
[40:27] Now we have received
[40:30] not the spirit of the world, but the
[40:34] spirit which is of God,
[40:36] that we might know the things that are
[40:39] freely given us of God. We have received
[40:43] the spirit of God that we might know the
[40:47] things that are freely given us of God.
[40:53] In second Peter,
[40:55] I'm going to read from verse one
[40:59] uh of the first chapter. Simon Peter, a
[41:03] servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
[41:06] to them that have obtained like precious
[41:10] faith with us through the righteousness
[41:13] of God and our savior Jesus Christ.
[41:17] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[41:20] through the knowledge of God and of
[41:22] Jesus our Lord, according as his divine
[41:27] power hath given unto us all things that
[41:33] pertain unto life and godliness through
[41:37] the knowledge of him that hath called us
[41:40] to glory and virtue. I would like each
[41:44] of us to read together in unison that
[41:48] verse three. According as his divine
[41:52] power hath given unto us all things that
[41:57] pertain unto life and godliness through
[42:01] the knowledge of him that hath called us
[42:04] to glory and virtue.
[42:07] And now please just back to Ephesians
[42:11] the first chapter.
[42:16] I often go to this verse in uh Peter. I
[42:22] often go to this verse, this third verse
[42:24] that we read in unison because each of
[42:28] us have times in our lives in fact is
[42:32] they come quite frequently I suppose
[42:34] when we have questions and the questions
[42:38] are not necessarily
[42:42] answered sufficiently or satisfactoryy
[42:45] to our our own
[42:48] uh curiosity about spiritual things and
[42:53] I always go to this because I say he has
[42:56] given us all things that pertain to life
[43:00] and a lot of the things we want to find
[43:02] out about doesn't really pertain to our
[43:04] you know it's not critical to our
[43:06] spiritual life but we'd like to know and
[43:08] if God doesn't tell you that's a good
[43:11] question to ask yourself is it really
[43:12] critical to my spiritual life you know
[43:15] is it coming on a cloud is it coming on
[43:17] a horse is he coming to you know what
[43:19] happens and a lot of those things, you
[43:22] know, we don't have to know.
[43:24] That's why are you going to establish
[43:26] the kingdom now? Says, it's not for you
[43:28] to know, you know, just they they wanted
[43:31] to find out and they had to write. They
[43:34] had to write that.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; It's not for you to know.
[43:39] That'd be good for us to do sometime.
[43:43] All right. In Ephesians 1,
[43:46] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the
[43:49] will of God, to the saints which are at
[43:52] Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ
[43:55] Jesus. Grace be to you, and peace from
[44:00] God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus
[44:03] Christ. Blessed be the God and father of
[44:06] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[44:09] us with all spiritual blessing in
[44:12] heavenly places in Christ. God bless his
[44:16] word to our heart. You may be seated.
[44:25] I appreciate your prayers. Brother Tony
[44:28] has arrived home and he certainly
[44:30] appreciate your prayers and I would say
[44:33] has labored very very hard. I got a
[44:36] final report uh while he was on his way
[44:40] back and uh has done an enormous
[44:44] enormous amount of work and we're
[44:46] looking forward to and the ministry and
[44:50] the saints in Brazil are looking forward
[44:52] to
[44:53] being able to move forward and see the
[44:58] message expanded and multiplied in their
[45:01] country. Now, we've read from Ephesians.
[45:05] And this book of Ephesians,
[45:08] brother Brandham says, is the book of
[45:10] Joshua.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; It's the book of Joshua of the New
[45:15] Testament. He said it's dividing up and
[45:19] setting in order the overcome ones.
[45:24] in adoption. He said the book of
[45:26] Ephesians is a book of Joshua and Joshua
[45:30] placing the people where they belong.
[45:34] Ephesians
[45:36] is intended
[45:38] to place you where you belong.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; And that's very important.
[45:46] He said God's wanting to place his
[45:48] church
[45:50] sons,
[45:53] daughters
[45:55] of God. God let me live. He said to see
[45:58] it is my prayer.
[46:01] So close till I can just feel it with my
[46:04] hands almost. That's how he was feeling
[46:07] it because there's a he could see
[46:11] the potential and the word coming to
[46:14] place the people. He said, "It's right
[46:17] here. It's right there. And that's what
[46:20] I've longed to see, waiting for the time
[46:24] when you walk down the street. There
[46:27] lays a laying there from his
[46:30] mother's womb. Silver and gold have I
[46:32] none. Oh, he said, waiting for the
[46:35] manifestations
[46:36] of the sons of God. Hallelujah. When God
[46:41] will make itself known, when they'll
[46:44] stop sickness, they'll stop cancer,
[46:47] they'll stop diseases.
[46:50] We speak of diseases may not just be
[46:53] physical diseases. Ephesians
[46:56] is God's given land
[47:00] &gt;&gt; to us as believers. It's God's given
[47:03] land or the place that he has ordained
[47:08] that we should live and enjoy the
[47:11] fullness of it. Ephesians and I'm saying
[47:15] all of this because we're going to go
[47:16] through a good part of it very very uh
[47:20] carefully.
[47:22] I've been speaking on last two services
[47:26] on the holy
[47:28] resourcerich
[47:30] nation.
[47:33] I felt very very directed. I thought I
[47:35] would be through and finished with this,
[47:36] but actually this morning it's larger
[47:39] today than it ever has been since I even
[47:41] started contemplating it. Uh God has
[47:44] something for us and we want to uh sit
[47:48] here with a open heart and a resolve.
[47:52] I'm going to receive what God has for
[47:54] me. I'm going to go out of this building
[47:57] with something that I didn't have when I
[47:59] came in.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; That's God's program for us. I can tell
[48:05] you, I can feel it within myself.
[48:08] Now one of the resources
[48:12] which we have as believers is faith. The
[48:16] Bible speaks of those believers who were
[48:19] rich in faith
[48:22] and there is a wealth of faith but faith
[48:26] needs to be exercised.
[48:29] faith needs to be uh worked in the law
[48:35] of its of of of uh the law of faith
[48:39] which the prophet said that law faith
[48:42] and love are the same thing.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; So you can't really have faith unless a
[48:49] person has the kind of love that God's
[48:51] talking about. For God is love.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; And so they work together,
[48:56] faith and love. And there is a law of
[49:00] love.
[49:01] Now Jesus said to some that he was
[49:06] speaking to in Matthew 21. Jesus
[49:08] answered and said unto them, "Verily I
[49:11] say unto you, if you have faith and
[49:14] doubt not,
[49:17] you shall not only do this which is done
[49:20] to the fig tree," which he' cursed the
[49:23] fig tree.
[49:25] But if you shall say to this mountain,
[49:27] "Be thou removed,
[49:29] and be thou cast into the sea," it shall
[49:33] be done.
[49:36] Have faith and don't doubt. Now,
[49:41] doubt maybe isn't unbelief in the pure
[49:44] sense of the word, but doubt will lead
[49:46] you to unbelief.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; So, don't doubt.
[49:51] And so, I want to be specific about a
[49:53] certain aspect of faith and a certain
[49:55] aspect of doubt.
[49:58] And that one, I'm going to just narrow
[50:00] it down because faith covers everything
[50:01] that there is in our spiritual life.
[50:06] You know, we could take faith and speak
[50:08] on it for years and wouldn't even
[50:10] scratch the surface. But I want to bring
[50:12] it down to one very very significant
[50:17] aspect and it's it it's significant to
[50:20] every person and it's this.
[50:26] We certainly don't doubt
[50:29] that Jesus Christ came into the world,
[50:33] that he was who he said he was.
[50:37] We do not doubt. I don't believe there's
[50:40] a doubt in a single person's mind here
[50:43] that Jesus Christ came into the world to
[50:45] save sinners.
[50:47] I don't believe anyone doubts that he
[50:50] was the son of God, born of the virgin.
[50:55] And we do not doubt, don't even have a
[50:58] trace of doubt that he died,
[51:02] suffered,
[51:04] and died and was buried
[51:08] &gt;&gt; and raised the third day.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; We believe that. I believe anyone from
[51:13] the youngest to the eldest in this uh
[51:16] sanctuary and wherever my voice is going
[51:20] today streaming. I believe that people
[51:23] would believe that. Any believer would
[51:25] believe that. And so we believe who he
[51:27] is. We don't have any doubt. We haven't
[51:30] got the least doubt that he is what he
[51:33] says that he is. And we're are we are
[51:36] not afraid to confess that. We're not
[51:39] afraid to confess everything he said he
[51:42] was.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; We're ready to say that. However,
[51:47] I am just I've been pondering
[51:51] very very deeply
[51:53] how effective his sacrifice and his
[51:57] victory at Calvary will be if we do not
[52:02] exercise the same degree of faith and
[52:06] confession in what he said we were
[52:10] &gt;&gt; as a result of his death. If we do not
[52:14] walk in what he said we were, if we
[52:18] don't confess and that's where we go
[52:20] quiet
[52:23] &gt;&gt; because
[52:25] then
[52:27] I have to say that we have some doubts
[52:30] &gt;&gt; and those doubts will lead to unbelief
[52:34] &gt;&gt; and unbelief will cause the word to be
[52:37] impotent and we will not receive what we
[52:40] are supposed to receive. That's just
[52:42] exactly the way that it will go.
[52:47] Confess what he said about you.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; In the message Christ, which was
[52:52] preached in Phoenix, an early message,
[52:56] brother Brandon makes a statement out of
[52:58] the scripture, let the mind that was in
[53:00] Christ be in you.
[53:04] Think his way of thinking.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Say what he says.
[53:09] Confession means
[53:12] to say the same thing. It'll be
[53:15] important that you remember that
[53:17] statement to say the same thing because
[53:19] actually brother Brandham is actually
[53:21] reaching into the into the Greek and I
[53:24] don't know if I can get to it this
[53:25] morning but it but it it has a reference
[53:28] further on in the message to repeat and
[53:31] to say the same thing that he said. And
[53:34] I think that we need to mean it when we
[53:36] say it. Confess is to confess the same
[53:40] thing. Say the same thing. I'm not
[53:42] repeating what he said. He's repeating
[53:44] it. I'm reading the whole thing. I'll
[53:47] start it again. Confession means to say
[53:50] the same thing. Confess is to confess
[53:54] the same thing. Say the same thing. He
[53:57] says, then don't confess your own mental
[53:59] conception.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, this mind is so weak.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; It is so weak. And Satan sws so many
[54:07] thoughts. Your mind even this morning at
[54:10] this minute is is active and flashing
[54:13] with all kinds of thoughts. But you want
[54:15] to deny any thought that is not in
[54:17] harmony with the word of God. Deny it
[54:22] &gt;&gt; and confess what he said.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Say shall I confess it if I don't s say
[54:26] see it? I would confess it till you do
[54:29] say it.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:37] be born again and confess his word.
[54:40] Confess what he said. That's confession.
[54:45] If you were sick, then you say, "By his
[54:47] stripes, I'm healed." And you have a
[54:50] right, he said, to his wounds.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Ain't that a beautiful statement? This
[54:55] morning, every sick person under the
[54:58] sound of my voice has a right to his
[55:00] wounds. You have a right to his wounds.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Worthy is the lamb that was slain.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Let the sick say, "I have a right to his
[55:12] wounds."
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Right now, you have a right to
[55:20] salvation.
[55:22] I have a right for the Holy Spirit.
[55:24] Anyone without the Holy Spirit, you want
[55:28] to confess, I have a right to the Holy
[55:31] Spirit. I have a right to salvation. The
[55:35] one that's not born again, I have a
[55:37] right. If God is speaking to you, if the
[55:40] Holy Spirit is moving upon you, you have
[55:42] a right to salvation.
[55:45] He promised it to me. said, "It's in you
[55:49] and your children and them that are a
[55:52] far off and as many as the Lord our God
[55:56] shall call."
[56:00] He said another scripture, "It is I be
[56:02] not afraid." So we pray for the sick. We
[56:05] do not heal the sick. I've seen tens of
[56:08] thousands of cases healed, definitely
[56:10] healed. four with records of rising from
[56:14] the dead in our own little ministry. But
[56:17] I have never healed anyone yet. It's
[56:20] your faith
[56:22] in a finished work that Christ did at
[56:25] Calvary. He was wounded for our
[56:28] transgressions and by his stripes we
[56:32] were healed. And now it's your faith in
[56:34] that finished work that does the work.
[56:37] And that's the way it is. You confess
[56:40] it. He's the high priest of the of our
[56:44] confession. He cannot do anything until
[56:48] you first profess that you accept
[56:52] &gt;&gt; and you confess what he said.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; You immobilize Christ if you don't
[56:59] confess it.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; And confess it in reality, not just some
[57:04] uh words coming out of a person's mouth,
[57:06] but you confess it because it's
[57:08] something rising up within you. even
[57:10] though you don't see it, you should just
[57:13] become blinded to the to the actual
[57:16] event that might be before you and and
[57:19] then confess what he said
[57:22] and you confess it and that is when you
[57:26] believe it and then he becomes the he's
[57:28] the high priest to make intercessions
[57:32] upon our confession.
[57:35] Now if we hesitate,
[57:38] if we hesitate, it indicates we have a
[57:41] question, we have a little doubt. If we
[57:43] hesitate, I'm speaking now specifically
[57:46] on your confession of what he has said
[57:51] about us about you as an individual if
[57:55] you hesitate.
[57:57] So I have used this example before.
[58:00] We will say Jesus Christ is a
[58:03] masterpiece, great masterpiece of God.
[58:05] And we'd say amen.
[58:08] I believe that we say the bride of Jesus
[58:11] Christ, she's a spotless
[58:14] pure virgin bride of Jesus Christ. She's
[58:17] a masterpiece.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Now we bring it down. Well, if she's a
[58:22] masterpiece, then each member must be a
[58:25] masterpiece because if if if there's a
[58:28] flaw in any member, then she can't be
[58:30] the masterpiece. And so now we have to
[58:33] bring it down to an individual saying,
[58:34] "I am a masterpiece."
[58:38] And that's where quite often the
[58:40] congregation gets a little quieter
[58:42] because we can say it on the big, you
[58:44] know, the big scene and we can make that
[58:47] kind of a claim for the the the whole
[58:50] universal bride, but then when we want
[58:51] to bring it down to the individual and
[58:54] so there should not be any hesitation.
[58:59] uh the service this morning I want and
[59:02] I'm praying earnestly that will be
[59:05] instruction and inspiration
[59:08] to you to develop the resources that are
[59:12] here in the word of God and especially
[59:16] in your land called the Ephesians.
[59:21] The land
[59:23] is both the fullness
[59:26] of the promise for your life. The land,
[59:29] that's what the land is, is both the
[59:31] fullness of the promise for you, your
[59:34] life in the Holy Ghost and also your
[59:38] physical body that is ordained to
[59:41] manifest that life. That's what the land
[59:45] comprises of. The land comprises, as the
[59:48] prophet says, of your life in the Holy
[59:51] Ghost. It's yours. You should you should
[59:54] uh and I'm saying to you, you should not
[59:56] only should but you must make that
[59:58] declaration, make that confession so
[1:00:00] that God moves on that. Then my life is
[1:00:04] my land and my land.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; It's my property.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; It's my life
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; in the Holy Ghost. That's my land
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; and I claim it.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; How much of it? Every every inch
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; right from border to border. I claim
[1:00:21] that whatever God said is mine is mine.
[1:00:26] I will confess that. I don't care what
[1:00:28] my eyes mortal eyes see or what my
[1:00:31] mortal body feels. And I bring my body
[1:00:34] into subjection to that word.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; I bring my mouth into subjection. I
[1:00:40] bring my thoughts into subjection to
[1:00:42] think those thoughts and my mouth to say
[1:00:45] those words. and then and then my high
[1:00:48] priest can move in intercession to God
[1:00:52] on my behalf. And then that's the only
[1:00:55] way that faith operates.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; There's one quote I want to
[1:01:08] bring up for you.
[1:01:41] it come up. Maybe you can bring it up
[1:01:43] then. Don't seem to be getting it here.
[1:01:49] I want you to slowly read this.
[1:01:52] Before a word, it's a thought.
[1:01:57] And a thought has to be created.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; I've ministered on that. A thought. Now,
[1:02:03] I want you to think this is God. God's
[1:02:06] thoughts. And and and before we even
[1:02:10] came into being,
[1:02:12] God thought, we say, "Well, God thought
[1:02:14] of us." But not just some, you know, uh,
[1:02:19] piece of clay and
[1:02:22] the chemistry of your body, but God
[1:02:26] created in his mind a thought
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; that would encompass what you are.
[1:02:36] Everything about you, even how you came
[1:02:38] down through the lineage to be what you
[1:02:42] are to be born where you were born and
[1:02:45] to be have certain unique
[1:02:46] characteristics and idiosyncrasies and a
[1:02:49] certain personality and certain
[1:02:51] characteristics. God knew all of that.
[1:02:55] And some of us are quiet and some are
[1:02:57] perhaps boisterous and some are silent
[1:02:59] and others are uh uh you know just a
[1:03:02] stream of conversation and and uh
[1:03:05] whatever more. Some are talented, some
[1:03:07] are musical, some haven't got a twitch
[1:03:10] in them. Some are artistic, others are
[1:03:12] not. Some like our sister Sally Dodd can
[1:03:14] go off and and give all kinds of poultry
[1:03:17] and so on and get so inspired and others
[1:03:20] are just flat don't have it. God made us
[1:03:22] what we are
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; for his own glory.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; He intended us to be what he made us to
[1:03:29] be.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; You believe that? And so he put it
[1:03:33] together. You need to say, "I'm not just
[1:03:37] a thought, but God created this
[1:03:40] thought."
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; And so God's thoughts become creation
[1:03:46] when it was spoke by a word. And that's
[1:03:50] when he presents it to you as a thought.
[1:03:54] He presents it to you. The word was
[1:03:56] presented to you. One day you came
[1:03:58] across and you heard somebody speak or a
[1:04:01] message came your way and you and the
[1:04:04] word was presented to you as a thought,
[1:04:08] his thoughts.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; And it was revealed to you. Now you it's
[1:04:13] even been revealed to you
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; after the revelation. Oh, I have such a
[1:04:18] revelation.
[1:04:19] He said, then it's still a thought.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Until
[1:04:25] until you speak it.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; That's how important confession is.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; There are, I believe, many in the
[1:04:32] message that I've had a real revelation.
[1:04:35] And I don't doubt they had a revelation,
[1:04:36] but they're they don't speak
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; that revelation on a personal level.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I had a revelation of what I
[1:04:48] am. We never talked about the bride of
[1:04:51] Jesus Christ hardly at all until the
[1:04:53] message came. And then you hear of it
[1:04:56] all the time. The bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:58] We talk about the virgin spotless bride
[1:05:00] of Jesus Christ say you never did it in
[1:05:02] the first place. That was a a it must be
[1:05:05] a revelation to you that is so real that
[1:05:09] you can from your heart speak it
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; and say it.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:15] say, "Well, I don't see it." That isn't
[1:05:17] what it says.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Doesn't say when you see it, say it.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Says when it's revealed to you, say it.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Speak it.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Speak it.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, speak the
[1:05:31] word.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Speak what is in accordance and in
[1:05:34] harmony with this word.
[1:05:37] That's our only That's our only hope.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:43] There's a great need to take possession
[1:05:45] of this land,
[1:05:48] this fullness of the promise. There's a
[1:05:50] great need amongst our own people right
[1:05:54] in this church and in any church I've
[1:05:57] ever been in,
[1:05:59] some greater than others. Perhaps a
[1:06:02] great need to develop these resources
[1:06:06] that God has placed in the church. And
[1:06:09] as I go through some of these resources,
[1:06:12] you're going to say, "Well, my I don't
[1:06:15] have that." That's not how you're going
[1:06:17] to get it by saying, "I don't have it."
[1:06:21] How you're going to get it is saying it
[1:06:23] is in the land.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; It is in the property.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, I haven't got much
[1:06:29] gold." It doesn't mean it's not in the
[1:06:30] land. God's put lots of it in the earth.
[1:06:33] Maybe we just don't have it. But lots of
[1:06:36] it is here and he has promised to supply
[1:06:39] our need according to his riches in
[1:06:41] glory. But these resources are are here
[1:06:46] that for the church and uh sufficient
[1:06:50] for our need.
[1:06:53] Now
[1:06:56] young men, the Bible says you're strong.
[1:07:00] You're strong.
[1:07:03] a young man or any man, but I I want to
[1:07:06] address a young man.
[1:07:09] You will not give answer to God
[1:07:13] and give an account to God because you
[1:07:15] have strength.
[1:07:17] You are born with whatever you have.
[1:07:21] One one is stronger than another.
[1:07:23] Everybody is is unique in their own way.
[1:07:26] You will never give an answer to God
[1:07:29] because you have a certain strength
[1:07:32] and that you got a strong body. But you
[1:07:35] will give an answer to God of how you
[1:07:37] used that strength
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; and what you did with that strength.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; That's what you'll use. That's what you
[1:07:44] give an answer for.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; A young woman
[1:07:49] beautiful in the youth of your beauty of
[1:07:54] your youth. You won't give an answer to
[1:07:57] God
[1:07:58] be for your beauty
[1:08:01] or for what you are. You won't answer to
[1:08:04] God for that. But you will answer to God
[1:08:07] for how you used
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; that beauty
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; and what you did with it. Whether you
[1:08:13] gave honor to God with it or whether you
[1:08:16] dragged some innocent man or bystander
[1:08:21] into thoughts that he shouldn't have,
[1:08:25] that would be a illuse of what God gave
[1:08:28] you.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; You won't give an answer to God because
[1:08:31] deep laying within you is some talent to
[1:08:35] play some musical instrument. And
[1:08:38] perhaps you have uh have not even
[1:08:40] developed that yet. We've got children
[1:08:42] here that perhaps don't even have a uh a
[1:08:45] clue that they have something in them.
[1:08:48] And God has given people great gifts and
[1:08:51] great talents and abilities. You won't
[1:08:54] give an answer to God for the fact that
[1:08:57] he has given you that or that you were
[1:08:59] born with that or that's just the way
[1:09:01] the genes were put together. But you
[1:09:03] will certainly answer to God with how
[1:09:06] you used that gift and use that talent.
[1:09:10] You can use it for God. You can use it
[1:09:12] for the benefit of the bride of Jesus
[1:09:14] Christ. You can use it for the benefit
[1:09:16] of the gospel. Or you can use it for
[1:09:18] some ill use, some wrong use, some
[1:09:21] sinful use.
[1:09:25] As mature, we'll say
[1:09:29] those of us who've been on the way for a
[1:09:31] while and you go through life and you
[1:09:34] gain some wisdom. Hopefully,
[1:09:36] you gain some experience.
[1:09:41] We will not give an answer to God for
[1:09:44] the fact that we accumulated
[1:09:46] wisdom or experience. Anyone who lives
[1:09:50] gains some experience and they gain some
[1:09:53] knowledge from that experience. You
[1:09:56] won't give an answer to God and say,
[1:09:57] "Well, I gained a lot of knowledge. I
[1:09:59] gained a lot of experience." He'll say,
[1:10:02] "What did you do with it?"
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; That's what we'll give an account to.
[1:10:09] You see, God speaks, I believe it was in
[1:10:12] the book of Ezekiel,
[1:10:15] and he and he begins to chastise the
[1:10:18] people because they took the gold. He
[1:10:23] said, "It was my gold and you took the
[1:10:26] silver." He said, "It's my silver
[1:10:29] and they took it." It wasn't it wasn't
[1:10:32] he wasn't chastising him because there
[1:10:34] was gold there or that the earth had
[1:10:37] silver and had wealth and riches and so
[1:10:40] on. He wasn't chastising him saying I
[1:10:43] give you I give you an earth that was
[1:10:45] wealthy. No, it was that they that they
[1:10:48] had developed it and had used it for an
[1:10:51] evil purpose
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; and you took and made idols out of it.
[1:10:56] You see,
[1:10:59] the Bible tells us that Adam was given
[1:11:02] dominion over all the earth. He could
[1:11:05] have done anything with it. And along
[1:11:07] come Cain, a product of the serpent uh
[1:11:11] from the tree of knowledge. And you can
[1:11:13] see where it went. Starts with murder.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Has that multiplied?
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Tragic.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; The world is filled with violence. But
[1:11:23] it started there with a seed. And then
[1:11:26] they began to work with iron and brass
[1:11:29] and all of these things. And and they
[1:11:32] had become very accomplished not very
[1:11:35] many years down the road. And they took
[1:11:37] all beginning to take the wealth and so
[1:11:39] on out of the earth and use it for all
[1:11:43] kinds of evil purposes. And our are our
[1:11:46] cities. Show me the city that is
[1:11:50] delightful and pure
[1:11:52] and holy and safe.
[1:11:56] Show me the city doesn't exist.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; And God's going to hold man accountable
[1:12:02] what he did with it.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; You took it out of the ground. You raped
[1:12:07] my earth. You stripped the land of its
[1:12:10] trees. You polluted the waters. You did
[1:12:13] all of these things. And look what you
[1:12:15] produced. showing that it's not of God.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; But behold, I make all things new. He
[1:12:21] said,
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; I'll make a new heaven and a new earth
[1:12:24] wherein dwells
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; righteousness.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; It'll be clean. It'll be pure. It'll be
[1:12:31] holy.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; And if you're if you're in love with
[1:12:35] this world, I let me announce to you,
[1:12:37] you'll be very uncomfortable in that
[1:12:39] one.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; You won't even get into that one if you
[1:12:42] love this one. He that loves this world
[1:12:45] is no friend of God.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; This is Satan's kingdom. This is Satan's
[1:12:50] world. And I say to the believers, let's
[1:12:53] not you utilize this this energy, these
[1:12:58] few days, this time as I spoke of the
[1:13:00] resource of time. You've only got so
[1:13:03] much time to live here. So many days, so
[1:13:06] many years, so many months. And we do
[1:13:08] not know how many.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; The last service when we had prayer for
[1:13:14] the family for an eight-year-old boy.
[1:13:17] 8-year-old boy.
[1:13:21] Who's here at 8 years old?
[1:13:24] Someone here at 8?
[1:13:27] Raise your hand. Who's eight? Look here.
[1:13:30] Why don't you stand up?
[1:13:33] Look at this little fell here. 8 years
[1:13:35] old. a boy like this
[1:13:39] playing soccer
[1:13:41] and and he was a very very fine well
[1:13:46] thought of young boy excelled
[1:13:50] in the things that he did and just felt
[1:13:53] a little tired who doesn't feel tired
[1:13:55] playing soccer went to his coach sat
[1:13:57] down on the bench and died right there
[1:14:02] family well known to her brother Sam
[1:14:04] Renie Renie Waldner there. Hey, you
[1:14:08] think he plans to go in a few minutes?
[1:14:11] Who knows? You're 14, you're 16, you're
[1:14:14] 20, you're strong, healthy. Tell you
[1:14:17] what, your breath's in the hands of God.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; You don't know whether you have the next
[1:14:22] five minutes.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; God's not going to hold you accountable
[1:14:28] that you have been given time. He's
[1:14:30] going to hold you accountable. What did
[1:14:31] you do with the time? I gave you a
[1:14:34] resource. I gave you a resource. Just
[1:14:36] think of people who have plotted their
[1:14:37] life all the way through life, lived
[1:14:39] maybe 60, 70 years or even more and live
[1:14:43] to themselves. Used all the energy just
[1:14:45] for themselves.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a shame.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; You're looking heaven right in the face
[1:14:51] when you live for others.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Every once in a while, I get a phone
[1:14:57] call and there's people I've known for
[1:14:59] years and all they can think of is
[1:15:01] themselves. Well, I want this and that
[1:15:04] didn't happen and the people didn't do
[1:15:05] this and something else and somebody did
[1:15:07] this to me and me and me and my and all
[1:15:09] the rest of it. I said, "Oh, for
[1:15:10] goodness sakes, why don't you grow up?"
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; 40 years old and haven't grown up. Life
[1:15:15] is to live for others. What are you
[1:15:18] doing with your life? Live for someone
[1:15:19] else. Live first for Christ. Live for
[1:15:22] his people. And he will love you for it.
[1:15:26] That's what life's all about. That's
[1:15:27] what this church needs to be all about.
[1:15:30] Amen.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; I'll let you know as far as me and
[1:15:32] myself's concerned, this pulpit is
[1:15:34] concerned, and the vision of this church
[1:15:36] is concerned is to live for others.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; I'm not satisfied that you have the
[1:15:41] message. We have the message. What about
[1:15:43] the next fellow, the next person, the
[1:15:45] next sister hasn't got anything in her
[1:15:48] hand. Oh God, we'll get the word to you.
[1:15:50] We'll do what we can because we only
[1:15:53] have x amount of time that you've
[1:15:56] allotted to us.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:16:00] Hallelujah.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Until you speak it, somebody here needs
[1:16:07] to be sang. I've lived enough for
[1:16:09] myself. I want to live for someone else.
[1:16:12] I'm going to find every moment that I
[1:16:14] can. Not necessarily just time, but I'm
[1:16:16] going to try to find every avenue, every
[1:16:19] channel that I can make myself
[1:16:21] available. That's the first thing.
[1:16:23] People come to me and say, "What can I
[1:16:25] do?" So, a lot of times there isn't
[1:16:26] something to do right then. But the
[1:16:28] first thing to do is make yourself
[1:16:29] available. I'm here. Call on me or even
[1:16:33] look.
[1:16:35] You know, there's all kinds of things to
[1:16:37] do. All right. Until you speak it.
[1:16:41] Here's what I consider a close to a
[1:16:44] perfect confession
[1:16:46] in the message. Concerned.
[1:16:48] Convinced. And concerned.
[1:16:52] Here's what the messenger is saying when
[1:16:55] he gets down towards the end of a
[1:16:57] service and he's he's got his back to
[1:17:00] the wall. He's got people that are sick
[1:17:03] and dying. He's got people that are
[1:17:06] demonpossessed.
[1:17:08] He's got people before him that are
[1:17:11] depending on him. They've come from
[1:17:12] miles. They've come across the ocean and
[1:17:15] they want now as a servant of God, he's
[1:17:19] on the spot to produce. Listen, this is
[1:17:22] this is where he needs to start. And he
[1:17:24] says, "I'm convinced that he's the same
[1:17:27] yesterday, today, and forever." That one
[1:17:31] statement, we might quote it, but
[1:17:33] there's not everybody that can live by
[1:17:35] it. If we're convinced he's the same
[1:17:37] yesterday, today, and forever, then what
[1:17:40] we're saying is if if we're if we would
[1:17:43] follow him today, it means we would
[1:17:45] follow him yesterday, and we'll follow
[1:17:47] him to the same degree today, and we'll
[1:17:49] do it tomorrow. So we'll say, "Oh Jesus,
[1:17:51] if I had only been here, I'd have loved
[1:17:53] you. I'd have followed you. I'd have
[1:17:54] been your disciple. What about now?
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; I'd have been your disciple. I'd have
[1:18:00] forsaken all back then. But right about
[1:18:02] now, I'm so busy. I'm so tied up. I'm so
[1:18:05] going. I'm up to here. Well, it's time
[1:18:07] not to get up to here. It's time to It's
[1:18:10] time to change the standard of things.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced he's the same yesterday,
[1:18:18] today, and forever. I wish you could
[1:18:20] hear his voice when he says this. I'm
[1:18:23] convinced in the ministry and the
[1:18:25] message I'm preaching. I I want to add
[1:18:28] today, I'm convinced in the message I'm
[1:18:30] preaching to you this morning. I'm
[1:18:32] convinced it's an answer to this
[1:18:35] congregation. It depends what you do
[1:18:37] with it, but I'm convinced it came from
[1:18:39] God.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; He said, I'm convinced that it's the
[1:18:45] truth. I'm convinced that these visions
[1:18:48] come from God. I'm convinced we're
[1:18:50] living in the last days. Can you say
[1:18:52] amen?
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced that this very spirit
[1:18:57] that's on you now is the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced. I'm impressed with the
[1:19:04] congregation before I came out and was
[1:19:06] still in prayer. I thought, I'm
[1:19:08] impressed with the young people of this
[1:19:11] congregation.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; I'm con Oh, people say, "Well, I find
[1:19:14] this, I find that." I tell you what, I'm
[1:19:16] impressed with the Holy Spirit upon the
[1:19:20] young people. I'm impressed with the
[1:19:23] young people in the school. I'm
[1:19:25] impressed with the teachers that teach
[1:19:27] them in such a godly fashion. I'm
[1:19:30] impressed with our with our deacons. I'm
[1:19:33] impressed with the trustees. I'm
[1:19:35] impressed with every person that I find
[1:19:39] I shake hands with. I find that spirit
[1:19:42] vibrating, a believer's spirit. What a
[1:19:45] privilege it is for me to walk with
[1:19:47] them.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; What a privilege it is that we know one
[1:19:52] another. What a privilege.
[1:19:55] I'm impressed. I'd like to shown you the
[1:19:58] pictures of the brother in China right
[1:20:01] now that at they have this had this
[1:20:04] convention and they have demanded of
[1:20:07] them that they confiscate all the
[1:20:08] message books. They demanded that they
[1:20:11] confiscate all the women's skirts.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; They've demanded that they recant and
[1:20:17] withdraw from these things. Listen. And
[1:20:21] the people in China said we will not
[1:20:24] compromise.
[1:20:27] Hallelujah.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; I'm impressed with these young
[1:20:34] believers.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; I'm impressed with them. I'm impressed
[1:20:39] with our brothers that translate. I'm
[1:20:42] impressed with everyone that works. I'm
[1:20:44] impressed with our brother Alex and how
[1:20:46] he keeps this church and the property in
[1:20:49] such a wonderful fine state. And uh I'm
[1:20:53] impressed with the people.
[1:20:55] Hallelujah.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, brother Alex came with
[1:21:02] me to Venezuela
[1:21:05] and our interpreter wouldn't didn't show
[1:21:07] up. And I'm glad he didn't because our
[1:21:10] brother Alex stood beside me and
[1:21:12] preached alongside me. And as far as
[1:21:14] that nation still, they think he's one
[1:21:16] of my associate ministers.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; I said, "Praise God, he is. I'm
[1:21:22] impressed with them.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; I've been in your homes and ate at your
[1:21:28] tables and see the standard that you
[1:21:30] hold before God. I'm impressed with it.
[1:21:34] I love you for it. And God loves you for
[1:21:36] it. And don't let the devil ever call
[1:21:40] cause you to downplay it. You say in the
[1:21:43] face of every evil, every doubting
[1:21:46] spirit, I will not doubt that.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; I am what God said I am. And that
[1:21:52] settles it.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to confess that
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; so my high priest can confess it.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; You feel like a failure. That's
[1:22:00] irrelevant.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; You if you say in one breath, I believe
[1:22:06] in Christ. I believe you lived. I
[1:22:08] believe you're holy.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; I believe you're the spotless son of
[1:22:11] God. Then you have to say, I believe
[1:22:13] that you purchased me at Calvary. You
[1:22:16] paid the price and I am a sinless
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; child of the living God.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; The devil hates it and that's why you
[1:22:26] need to say it.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; It's a perfect confession.
[1:22:33] He said, "I'm thoroughly convinced that
[1:22:36] the Holy Ghost is the right way. I'm
[1:22:38] convinced that the Bible way is the
[1:22:40] truth." He wasn't speaking of this
[1:22:41] church, but it sounds good anyway.
[1:22:46] I'm convinced that this is Jesus Christ
[1:22:48] here now. Are you convinced? Are you
[1:22:52] convinced that this is Jesus Christ here
[1:22:55] in this building now?
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Then God can do something for you. You
[1:23:01] confess it. You want to say the same
[1:23:03] thing. I'm convinced that this is not
[1:23:06] just a good feeling. I'm convinced this
[1:23:08] is not just my emotions. I'm convinced
[1:23:11] this is the Holy Ghost speaking the
[1:23:14] spirit of God to my soul telling me
[1:23:17] that's the truth.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; And you know it's the truth.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; This isn't some just some little
[1:23:26] preacher up here excited. I'm convinced
[1:23:29] it's Jesus Christ here now. Amen.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced it's the same pillar of
[1:23:36] fire that burned in the burning bush and
[1:23:39] spoke God speaking through it to Moses.
[1:23:42] That's the same pillar of fire leading a
[1:23:44] people out. I'm convinced this is the
[1:23:46] third Exodus.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced as it led them out of
[1:23:55] Egypt and into a promised land. This is
[1:23:58] leading us right into a rapture. And the
[1:24:01] same God
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; is going to change the atoms of these
[1:24:05] bodies,
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; we can we're we confess that.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Just speaking the other day here in the
[1:24:14] church of the new heaven and new earth
[1:24:16] and just made a comment on it speaking
[1:24:20] how the heavens will be on fire
[1:24:22] and the elements thereof will melt with
[1:24:25] fervent heat. listen to me. While you
[1:24:28] sat here and didn't perhaps know
[1:24:29] anything about it, an Israeli scientist
[1:24:33] uh predicted and some of the people sent
[1:24:35] it to me, I appreciate that. Sent me uh
[1:24:39] his his not only his prediction, but he
[1:24:42] predicted there was going to be a giant
[1:24:45] uh flash of fire in the heavens, a
[1:24:50] burst. You know some now we have these
[1:24:52] sunbursts and changes our affects the
[1:24:56] radioactive and I should not radioactive
[1:24:58] but the radio waves and the gamma rays
[1:25:01] that uh come out flow out from this and
[1:25:04] there was a the there was a neutron star
[1:25:09] and there was a burst off this neutron
[1:25:11] star. They said it was December the
[1:25:14] 27th,
[1:25:16] one day after the tsunami
[1:25:19] uh disaster.
[1:25:21] And this burst of fire was so great. If
[1:25:27] you've ever any of you ever read of the
[1:25:29] power of our sun, it is beyond our
[1:25:33] imagination. Our mind can't grasp the
[1:25:37] strength of our sun. that one burst from
[1:25:40] that neutron star which was 50,000 light
[1:25:43] years out into space in the midst of our
[1:25:48] the midst of our galaxy. It said that it
[1:25:50] generated somewhere between what our sun
[1:25:54] could produce in 100 to 200,000 years in
[1:25:59] one flash. And they said had that been
[1:26:03] closer to the earth
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; and they just hung it there.
[1:26:07] They just left it. They didn't say
[1:26:09] anything about it. Had it been closer to
[1:26:12] the earth. And even right now, they said
[1:26:13] that the the radio waves and so on is
[1:26:17] being affected by the effects of that
[1:26:19] here on earth. We're sitting here. We
[1:26:22] think, "Oh, well, the heavens be on
[1:26:24] fire." I tell you what, God could just
[1:26:26] send a little pee of power, just a
[1:26:30] little pea pod of power and would burn
[1:26:33] his heavens up. And our prophet said
[1:26:36] that he's going to burn the atmospheres
[1:26:39] because it holds Satan himself as the
[1:26:42] prince of the power of the air.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; I tell you, he will go up into a smoke
[1:26:47] of some kind. He'll disappear.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; And all the angels that fell with him
[1:26:54] and all the wicked who love his ways,
[1:26:57] you'll evaporate
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; and hang before a righteous God. Man in
[1:27:04] his little insignificance wonders how
[1:27:06] God's going to do those things. I tell
[1:27:08] you what, who is God? We can't even
[1:27:11] begin to mention his name. We're not
[1:27:14] worthy to utter his name.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; That's who he is. Amen.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; If you're not right with God, be right
[1:27:22] with God today.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced.
[1:27:39] I want to just continue with this
[1:27:42] confession that Brother Brandham made.
[1:27:45] I'm convinced
[1:27:48] the Holy Spirit
[1:27:52] that Jesus Christ is here and now. I'm
[1:27:54] convinced
[1:27:56] if we believe him at this minute, I'm
[1:27:59] convinced he'll heal every sick person.
[1:28:02] That's what he was convinced
[1:28:06] in a twinkling of an eye. I'm convinced
[1:28:09] he'll pour out the Holy Spirit
[1:28:13] up upon here till there be such a sh
[1:28:16] such a shout
[1:28:18] till hard to tell what would take place.
[1:28:22] I'm convinced. He said, "I believe it
[1:28:23] with all my heart, not because I'm an
[1:28:26] old man." Said, "I preached this when I
[1:28:29] was a kid, not not over 20 years old.
[1:28:33] And I'm convinced since that day he met
[1:28:36] me on the river." Hallelujah. Said, "I'm
[1:28:40] convinced that he's here now."
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Going back, it didn't mean whether it's
[1:28:43] 30 years ago or 20 years ago, he had he
[1:28:46] was convinced. It was the same one, the
[1:28:49] same voice, the same power. here to do
[1:28:52] the same thing.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, we must not let this undeveloped
[1:28:58] earth, that's this one here, we need to
[1:29:00] bring it into subjection.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every person, I don't care what
[1:29:05] state you're in. I don't care what goes
[1:29:07] through your mind. It's time. It's time
[1:29:10] that we develop the resources that God
[1:29:14] has placed within us. Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "When I come to the earth,
[1:29:28] when the son of man returns, will he
[1:29:31] says he didn't say will I find churches?
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Will I find sincerity?"
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; That isn't what he said.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Will I find teachers?
[1:29:43] Will I find teaching the Bible? Will I
[1:29:45] find doing this? He said, "Will I find
[1:29:48] faith?"
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; You got the power. You've got the power.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; You don't have to pray for power. You've
[1:29:56] got the power. He said, "You need faith
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; potentially.
[1:30:01] Know where you are in Christ." Where you
[1:30:04] are in Christ. Then yield yourself
[1:30:08] potentially. So here this morning, I
[1:30:10] want to take you to that step. I want
[1:30:13] you to see potentially
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; what you are in Christ
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; potentially and then yield yourself to
[1:30:21] that
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; as he spoke of of those that were
[1:30:26] physically sick. Put a fully healed
[1:30:29] person in front of you before you and
[1:30:33] take a step at a time and walk into that
[1:30:37] perfectly healed body
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; because you're putting something before
[1:30:40] you. That's true. that's real and that
[1:30:43] God intended.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; And I think as a body of people, it
[1:30:47] doesn't doesn't do us any good to nibble
[1:30:50] at the heels of the church or nibble at
[1:30:52] the heels of the ministry or nibble at
[1:30:54] the heels of some other brother or
[1:30:55] sister. It doesn't do what are you going
[1:30:57] to do? You're not going to achieve
[1:30:59] anything. That's a devil's playground.
[1:31:02] But when a man or woman can look and
[1:31:05] say, "I'm convinced. I'm convinced
[1:31:07] that's a son of God. That's a daughter
[1:31:08] of God. I'm convinced in the bride of
[1:31:11] Jesus Christ. I'm convinced in the
[1:31:13] vision that God has given here even in
[1:31:15] the ministry. I'm convinced and I am
[1:31:18] here to build up even as even as uh
[1:31:22] perhaps I can only do a little bit, but
[1:31:24] I'm going to make sure my mouth says
[1:31:26] words of encouragement. I'm going to
[1:31:28] make sure my mouth establishes people.
[1:31:31] I'm going to let anybody know that talks
[1:31:33] to me that I love the body of Jesus
[1:31:36] Christ. Amen. And I see a glorious body
[1:31:40] without spot or wrinkle. And I walk with
[1:31:43] those that God has placed me amongst.
[1:31:46] And we walk towards that whole body.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Until we walk into it, until
[1:31:52] we depart this place.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; That's the program.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; That's the program. And nothing else
[1:32:01] ever works.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; I've been preaching now 48 years. I've
[1:32:05] seen a lot of people I've seen a lot of
[1:32:08] people in the direction that they've
[1:32:10] gone and I tell this congregation before
[1:32:13] almighty God before this word laying
[1:32:16] here open before me before the message
[1:32:18] which we have received according to the
[1:32:20] prophet's message that's the thing that
[1:32:22] you do he said you you speak nice things
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; of one another
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:32:34] praise Praise God.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Have confidence
[1:32:39] in one another and build on those kind
[1:32:42] of resources
[1:32:44] in uh
[1:32:47] his seed shall possess the gate of the
[1:32:49] enemy.
[1:32:52] He says you just feel that sweetness of
[1:32:54] the spirit just moving over the
[1:32:57] audience. Somebody might say I don't
[1:32:59] feel it. You need to develop
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; you need to develop a sense. You need to
[1:33:05] develop an awareness. Oh God, I sat
[1:33:09] there when I should have been. I should
[1:33:11] have been experienc I should have been
[1:33:13] sensing your spirit, your presence. I
[1:33:15] didn't sense it. Others did. Oh God,
[1:33:19] take me. Cause me
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; to be developed.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To develop that resource of
[1:33:27] this earth. And he said, he went on to
[1:33:30] say,
[1:33:31] now honestly before God, how many can
[1:33:33] really feel that Holy Spirit is close
[1:33:38] sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[1:33:41] Jesus? Move, sweet spirit of God. And I
[1:33:45] blend my voice with his voice here
[1:33:47] today. Move, sweet spirit of God.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Do you know it's him? Amen.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Young, old, married, unmarried, till you
[1:33:59] know it's him.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Bound, backslider,
[1:34:02] whatever it is, away from God, whatever
[1:34:05] you are, that you may know it's him. I
[1:34:09] say move, Holy Spirit.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Call from death unto life. I'm convinced
[1:34:19] that there's power here now present by
[1:34:23] the living Christ to bring someone who
[1:34:26] is dead in trespasses and sins and cause
[1:34:30] them to be born again by the power of
[1:34:33] the resurrected Christ.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; We're in the resurrection business.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; We're in a resurrection business.
[1:34:46] My wife read me a quote this morning
[1:34:48] from some philosopher or something. He
[1:34:50] said, "We believe in resurrection." He
[1:34:51] says, "And the resurrection of the
[1:34:53] dead." He said, "Sometimes it's a lot
[1:34:55] harder to resurrect those that are
[1:34:56] living."
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; That's what he found. But I say with the
[1:35:02] power of God dwelling in his church, we
[1:35:05] believe in the resurrection.
[1:35:07] Amen.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Call from death unto life. Speak to the
[1:35:15] seed of Abraham. Give them faith. Let
[1:35:18] them know that that they let them know
[1:35:21] that they
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; can possess the gate of every enemy.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; You believe that's your messenger.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Let them believe. Let them have faith.
[1:35:33] They can believe. They can possess the
[1:35:35] gate of every enemy because every enemy
[1:35:38] has been put under the feet of Christ,
[1:35:40] even death. And we
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; and I want you to say, "And I
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; stand
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; in him
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; as a conqueror."
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say that one?
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; How about putting the drill rig down?
[1:35:56] Don't take up a sore a just a a cample a
[1:36:00] sore core sample. I'll get it right yet.
[1:36:04] Don't just take up a core sample and
[1:36:06] look at the core sample. Drill down and
[1:36:09] say, "I hit the motherload."
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; I found the main deposit.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to Quad.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Good to see you, brother John. Sister
[1:36:22] Marie, glad you're here.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; It's a service we all need to be in.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I am
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; a conqueror in Christ Jesus. So I failed
[1:36:37] him yesterday. Forget yesterday. Confess
[1:36:40] what you're hearing now.
[1:36:43] I'm a confessor of the promise of God.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; It can't come any other way.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Develop the resource. You got it in you.
[1:36:53] Amen.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "Every enemy
[1:36:59] is under your feet as long as you are in
[1:37:04] Christ." Say, "Well, that's the problem.
[1:37:07] I'm not in Christ." Well, develop the
[1:37:09] resource today and get him here. Get her
[1:37:11] into Christ.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; How do I get into Christ? By confessing.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; If you've done wrong, confess it.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; If you've sinned, confess it. Amen.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; I'll give you his word. As soon as you
[1:37:25] confess it, soon as you confess you're
[1:37:27] wrong, have you got sin? Have you got
[1:37:29] something that's standing between you
[1:37:31] and God? As soon as you confess it with
[1:37:33] a repentant heart, it falls, he said,
[1:37:36] into the bleach of the blood of Jesus
[1:37:38] Christ. And the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:37:40] it it destroys the very chemistry of
[1:37:43] that disobedience. It takes iniquity and
[1:37:46] you can't find it again.
[1:37:50] You can't find it again.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; You drop that drop of ink into that into
[1:37:58] that tub of bleach. He said it even
[1:38:01] breaks up the chemistry and makes the
[1:38:04] ink bleach.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Try to figure that one out.
[1:38:11] God is able to take your wrongs, your
[1:38:14] insecurities, your complexes, and yes,
[1:38:18] even your disobedience and turn it
[1:38:20] around to his glory.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; He's able.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; He's able
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; to take your your wrongs.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; He's able to take your disobedience and
[1:38:35] cause it to glorify himself if you will
[1:38:38] turn your life to him now.
[1:38:40] [Applause]
[1:38:43] Hallelujah to God.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends. I feel the
[1:38:49] devil's on the run. The devil's
[1:38:52] defeated.
[1:38:53] He hates this kind of word. I say glory
[1:38:57] to God.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; This is what the church needs to hear.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; I could pick out all your little faults.
[1:39:08] You know what your faults are. People
[1:39:11] don't need to hear about their faults.
[1:39:12] They need to hear how to get rid of
[1:39:14] them.
[1:39:15] They need to rise above them.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; They need to hear how it won't happen
[1:39:20] anymore. I'm showing you the way out.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. This is the way of power.
[1:39:26] This is the way of victory.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; This is the language of the conqueror.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; You are a conqueror in him.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:37] Hallelujah.
[1:39:39] Hallelujah.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; My goodness,
[1:39:43] our time is going.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "Every enemy's under your
[1:39:50] feet."
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; I want you to hear the last prayer, not
[1:39:53] a quote, is a living word
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; for this hour
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; for the body and bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "Because you're in Christ and
[1:40:03] because everything is under his feet."
[1:40:05] How do we get into him? by one spirit.
[1:40:08] We're all baptized into one body and
[1:40:10] been made partakers of the same
[1:40:12] blessing. The same power. The same
[1:40:15] blessing. The same power.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Why don't we say that? The same
[1:40:21] blessing. The same power. The same
[1:40:24] blessing. The same power.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; His power.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; The same faith dwells within our heart
[1:40:33] that dwelt in Abraham.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Our father Abraham in the faith, the
[1:40:41] same faith is here this morning.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; It dwelt in Abraham and the same faith
[1:40:50] that was in Abraham holding a promise of
[1:40:52] God just before the destruction of the
[1:40:54] world. We don't doubt that. Just before
[1:40:57] the destruction of the world, Sodom,
[1:40:59] world in the last in Lot's day. Now,
[1:41:03] here it is. That same faith
[1:41:08] can draw that same angel
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; to this building.
[1:41:16] That same faith you said, I have the
[1:41:19] same faith that was in my father
[1:41:22] Abraham. And that faith, it needs to be
[1:41:25] developed
[1:41:26] and can draw that angel,
[1:41:29] the angel of the Lord into this building
[1:41:34] at this time.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Then you can say from your soul, all
[1:41:41] things are possible
[1:41:45] to them that believe.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:41:54] [Applause]
[1:42:02] says, "You believe it."
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; And he asked, "How many out there
[1:42:06] believe it?" How many out there believe
[1:42:08] it?
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Your faith,
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; that's enough to even do with all the
[1:42:13] doubters.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; That's enough.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; You that believe it is enough. I don't
[1:42:19] care if there are those that don't
[1:42:20] believe it. It still will happen.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; And the bound will be delivered
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; and the sick shall be healed
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; and the lost shall be found.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; That's thus sayeth the word.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:42:52] I want you to see just a little bit of
[1:42:55] your land and what it what it might be
[1:42:59] that we need to develop in these
[1:43:02] resources of this land.
[1:43:24] Grace be unto you
[1:43:28] and peace.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Who's here?
[1:43:33] Say, I I don't have peace.
[1:43:37] This is your land.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; This is your possession. And there's a
[1:43:42] motherload of peace. And the devil would
[1:43:44] like you to be all distressed so you
[1:43:46] don't have any peace. I say unto you,
[1:43:49] this is your this is your inheritance.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Don't let him lie to you about this.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Peace
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; be unto you
[1:44:03] from God
[1:44:07] and the Lord Jesus Christ. He has chosen
[1:44:11] us.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. in him
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; You've got a corner of your property
[1:44:20] that announces that you the people who
[1:44:22] live here are chosen.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; They're the chosen race.
[1:44:36] Having predestinated us
[1:44:40] unto the adoption of children,
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; I have been predestinated
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:44:49] Christ
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; to himself.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; What a statement.
[1:44:55] I've been chosen.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; I've been sent peace and grace.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; He has made Oh, I'd love to take you in
[1:45:10] the word. He has actually fashioned.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; He's made us
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; to be accepted
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; into beloved.
[1:45:22] G.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:25] My mouth can hardly frame the words.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; It is so glorious.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; God has made us, made me, made you
[1:45:35] accepted
[1:45:37] the before a holy God who these lips
[1:45:41] aren't worthy to frame the his name. And
[1:45:45] that's why the Jews think it is
[1:45:47] absolutely impossible for a human to
[1:45:50] speak the name of God. Whether we say
[1:45:52] his name, who knows exactly how the the
[1:45:56] the the sound is or the f uh the how
[1:46:00] it's how it's pronounced. But to think
[1:46:02] that we can come into his presence and
[1:46:05] be accepted
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; only because there's blood
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; accepted in the beloved.
[1:46:17] We have
[1:46:19] redemption.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Not will have. We have redemption
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; through his blood.
[1:46:34] forgiveness.
[1:46:37] Who might need this?
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Who might need this this morning?
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Forgiveness.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Who might need it?
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Maybe someone sitting somewhere in the
[1:46:48] church or someone who's not in the
[1:46:51] building right now needs forgiveness and
[1:46:54] you've got it to give them.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; So, I've had a hard time. That's not the
[1:46:59] point. I'm here and I felt urged by
[1:47:02] God's spirit to say, "You've got it.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; You've got the material.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; You've got it in you.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; You can forgive them." How many times
[1:47:12] Peter thought he was really going
[1:47:14] overboard?
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Should I forgive him seven times in a
[1:47:18] day?
[1:47:23] 70
[1:47:25] times seven.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Isn't that about 490?
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Is that more?
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; 490 times.
[1:47:39] 489.
[1:47:43] If he if he comes again or if she comes
[1:47:46] again, I think I'll give him a piece of
[1:47:48] my mind. Don't do it. Amen.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; And nobody here has had to go 490 times
[1:47:55] and probably not even seven.
[1:47:58] How many times? And from your heart,
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; you forgive. Even before they come,
[1:48:05] they're forgiven.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; And leave the consequences to God. What
[1:48:10] kind of a God do we serve? We have a
[1:48:13] great judge. He knows absolutely
[1:48:15] everything. He knows the beginning from
[1:48:17] the end. He knows who's responsible,
[1:48:20] who's not responsible. He knows what the
[1:48:22] intent was.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Forgive
[1:48:33] and he has abounded toward us in all
[1:48:37] wisdom and prudence.
[1:48:50] having made known unto us
[1:48:53] the mystery of his will. I say, "Oh,
[1:48:56] when they talk about mysteries, I just
[1:48:57] feel you need to develop
[1:49:02] that area."
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, I have so much I could say. Each one
[1:49:06] of these are sermon in the dispensation
[1:49:09] of the fullness of times. he might
[1:49:10] gather together in one all things that
[1:49:13] are Christ. How come you're here?
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, someone else invited me
[1:49:18] this, that, the other thing. What about
[1:49:20] putting God in the formula? What about
[1:49:22] putting God in the equation? What about
[1:49:24] leaving everyone else out and say, "God
[1:49:26] did it.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; I'm here because God gathered me.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; God put his arm around me." Say, "Well,
[1:49:34] it was this circumstance, that
[1:49:36] circumstance." Forget the circumstance.
[1:49:38] Forget the people. Forget everything
[1:49:40] else. Forget the preacher. Say, "God
[1:49:42] gathered me.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord."
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; In whom also we have, we have obtained.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; We have an inheritance.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; I think some here are like the prodal.
[1:50:00] How many have heard of the prodical son?
[1:50:01] Let me see your hands. How many have
[1:50:03] heard of the prodical son?
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; How many have never heard of him?
[1:50:07] Well, a whole bunch of people. really
[1:50:08] don't know whether they did or not. But
[1:50:09] anyway,
[1:50:12] how many you afraid to raise your hands?
[1:50:16] God bless his honest brother. Are there
[1:50:18] some others that want to join him?
[1:50:22] I'll shake your hand after the service.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; But the prodal had a brother.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; And the prodal, you know, he was a
[1:50:32] rascal. He got everything. He came to
[1:50:34] his father, give me all my inheritance.
[1:50:37] Oh man, I can't get out of here to get
[1:50:40] ready to uh feel my wild oats. I just
[1:50:43] want to I want to taste the wall. I want
[1:50:45] to be out of I'm out of here. So he
[1:50:48] checked out and he went down into far
[1:50:51] country and wasted
[1:50:53] all of his living.
[1:50:56] And you know what? When he was wasting
[1:50:58] it, he had friends.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; You always got friends when you're
[1:51:03] wasting it. Oh, they love you. my
[1:51:06] friends.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Then when uh money was gone, the friends
[1:51:14] were gone. His best friends was some
[1:51:16] pigs.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; And he even shared dinner with them.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; He ate what the pigs ate.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; You know, one day probably chewing on an
[1:51:26] old corn cob. He's thought, "You know
[1:51:29] what? This is ridiculous. I'm going to
[1:51:31] throw this thing down. I remember my
[1:51:33] father's servants. They ate a whole lot.
[1:51:36] My father, he treated his servants so
[1:51:38] well and they ate so well. What am I
[1:51:41] doing down this mess? Oh, praise God for
[1:51:44] his grace.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Kind of waking a person up. He said, "I
[1:51:50] will return to my father's house and I
[1:51:52] will tell him I have sinned against you
[1:51:56] and against heaven. I've sinned against
[1:51:59] everybody. I've been a disgrace to the
[1:52:01] family." And he got it all planned. How
[1:52:04] he was going to pray,
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; just what he was going to say.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's going to say that just the
[1:52:10] right kind of prayer. I tell you what,
[1:52:13] he got coming home. His father had been
[1:52:15] looking for him
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; cuz his father knew. His father knew
[1:52:20] that son's going to come. He's got to
[1:52:22] come back. He's got to come back because
[1:52:25] I believe for him. I don't know how and
[1:52:28] I don't know when, but he's got to come
[1:52:30] back and he kept looking for him. One
[1:52:33] day there he comes over the hill. His
[1:52:35] father runs out to him. He get father I
[1:52:38] said forget it.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; I know all about it. I know what this
[1:52:42] foolishness is all about. Come on in. Uh
[1:52:45] son, go and servant go and get the
[1:52:48] fatted calf. Another one, please run to
[1:52:50] the closet and get the best robe. Oh, go
[1:52:52] to the jewelry box and get the ring out.
[1:52:54] And yes, send these servants out to all
[1:52:57] the neighbors. We're going to have a
[1:52:59] feast tonight. There's going to be
[1:53:01] rejoicing tonight. My son that was lost
[1:53:04] has come home.
[1:53:06] [Applause]
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; And one wasn't happy.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; He was the older brother.
[1:53:17] He says, "I go to church all the time.
[1:53:20] I've never failed to go to the tithe box
[1:53:23] and put in my tithing. And when they
[1:53:25] talked to when brother Admma talked
[1:53:27] about the uh the overseas, I was there.
[1:53:32] And when they needed some extra work
[1:53:33] done, I was there. I worked around the
[1:53:36] church. I was so faithful. I never
[1:53:38] disobeyed any of your any of your any of
[1:53:41] your laws or any of your uh principles.
[1:53:46] I never disobeyed them ever. The father
[1:53:50] came out and that's what he said to him.
[1:53:52] He said, "Here, I've been with you all
[1:53:54] these years. I've worked in the field.
[1:53:57] I've worked through the heat. I've
[1:53:58] worked through the cold. I've been as
[1:54:00] faithful. You could count on me. I'd be
[1:54:02] sitting in my seat. I sang when they
[1:54:05] sang. I did what I prayed when they
[1:54:08] pray. I was faithful.
[1:54:11] And never once did I go against
[1:54:15] one of your laws.
[1:54:18] You know what the father said? He didn't
[1:54:20] say, "Well, I remember a time."
[1:54:23] No, he said,
[1:54:26] "All that I have is yours."
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; He was so hardwork.
[1:54:35] He was so unhappy.
[1:54:38] He was unhappy because he never he never
[1:54:44] got to appreciate the resources that
[1:54:46] were right there. That best garment hung
[1:54:48] there all the time.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; That calf they were just killing was
[1:54:52] always out in the field. That ring was
[1:54:55] always in the jewelry box. The neighbors
[1:54:57] were always there. But he didn't know
[1:54:59] how to enjoy it.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; He didn't know how to enjoy it. He just,
[1:55:03] you know, just his old grumpy self.
[1:55:07] Oh, I'd sooner have somebody
[1:55:11] discover
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; that there's some riches around.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; There's such a riches in fellowship.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; I've had people say, "I don't have any
[1:55:22] friends. Nobody comes over to see me and
[1:55:25] I am upset." I said, "How did you invite
[1:55:28] anybody?" Well, no. I'm kind of a loner.
[1:55:31] Well, then you'll stay alone.
[1:55:34] How about inviting somebody? How about
[1:55:36] inviting somebody and they'll be there?
[1:55:39] Someone says
[1:55:42] just the other day they're sitting here.
[1:55:46] He said, "We invited you." They invited
[1:55:48] us and we came within two days. He said,
[1:55:51] "We couldn't believe it. You're so
[1:55:53] busy." I said, "When did you invite us?"
[1:55:56] So you invite us. We were right there.
[1:55:58] Oh, I tell you what. Don't overload me
[1:56:01] now.
[1:56:07] But there's a well
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; of fellowship.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; There's a well within the body of
[1:56:14] Christ. Let me say to you as I come to a
[1:56:16] close, the closet is full of beautiful
[1:56:19] robes.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; And the and the field is full of fatted
[1:56:24] calves
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; and the neighbors are waiting to rejoice
[1:56:28] with you.
[1:56:31] They don't want to go over all of your
[1:56:33] troubles and all of that here. They're
[1:56:35] interested in hearing your positive
[1:56:36] confession, what God did for you, what
[1:56:39] you got out of the word of God, and what
[1:56:42] God is doing in your life. That's what
[1:56:44] we fellowship around.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Well, I haven't got very far. Brother
[1:56:51] Lance is going to preach tonight. And he
[1:56:54] generally comes and I come with meat and
[1:56:56] potatoes, and he comes with the icing on
[1:56:58] the cake. So, he'll come with dessert
[1:57:00] tonight. I'm sure. I'm anxious to hear
[1:57:03] it. I just I just started. All we did
[1:57:06] was just kind of get through the gate.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; And the land looks wonderful, doesn't
[1:57:12] it?
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Doesn't the land look wonderful?
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:57:21] it just depends what kind of eyes. We've
[1:57:23] got the eyes of Joshua and Caleb.
[1:57:26] They haven't got the eyes of the others
[1:57:28] said, "Oh my, these wall cities."
[1:57:32] And you know what? Then they they looked
[1:57:34] in relationship to the obstacle to
[1:57:37] themselves and they said, "We saw the
[1:57:39] men, giants in the land, and we are like
[1:57:45] grasshoppers."
[1:57:47] Now, that was one testimony.
[1:57:50] The other two said, "They're just bread
[1:57:52] for us. Let's go and eat them up.
[1:57:55] [Applause]
[1:57:57] And here's the grapes to prove it.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; And the prophet used the language used
[1:58:02] that language in reference to the word
[1:58:04] that we have received. I tell you,
[1:58:06] somebody went across.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Somebody has gone into the presence of
[1:58:11] God. They've come back with a grapes of
[1:58:14] esto.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; It's a good land, friends. It's a good
[1:58:18] land. It's a good land, young ladies.
[1:58:20] It's a good land, young couples. It's a
[1:58:22] good land,
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; young man. It's a good land.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Develop that land.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; It's there. It is there. You have it.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; You have it now. You have it.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; It's yours. You've already had it.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Maybe you haven't developed it.
[1:58:42] Just develop it.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Exercise it.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Work on it. So, well, how do I? We'll
[1:58:50] start with the confession.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; If you can't do anything between now and
[1:58:54] the next service, just say, I am not
[1:58:57] going to confess anything of a negative
[1:58:59] nature.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; I am going to confess what God's word
[1:59:02] has said. That's what I'm going to say.
[1:59:04] I'm going to say it in the face of every
[1:59:05] devil. I'm going to say it in the face
[1:59:07] of every every failure.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Who doesn't fail? We all fail.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; What do you do when you fail? I failed.
[1:59:19] So many times I would even want to I
[1:59:21] don't want to think about it.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; What do you do?
[1:59:25] Sometimes I bury my head.
[1:59:28] That's awful. This will pass.
[1:59:32] And then I think of what the prophet
[1:59:33] said. Any son of God when he falls,
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; he will quickly get up.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I'm going to get up.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get up." And that devil
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; that kind of lured me to maybe say that
[1:59:51] or to do that or whatever more. I'm
[1:59:54] going to do him damage
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; or cause me to doubt that or cause me to
[1:59:58] be weak in my faith. I'm going to do him
[2:00:00] damage.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; My God
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; has said certain things
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to confess that.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; I believe that will give him the
[2:00:10] greatest pleasure
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; if he sees you confessing that.
[2:00:15] Amen.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; We'll have our musicians and and Lord
[2:00:21] willing, I'd like to show you something
[2:00:23] of the rest of the land. I have I think
[2:00:25] I've only gone through just a handful of
[2:00:27] slides. I'm on slide four. I've probably
[2:00:29] got 16 or 17. And uh something we could
[2:00:33] say on each one of them. Did you like
[2:00:35] looking at your land?
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; We don't have any you don't have any
[2:00:40] doubt of what he did.
[2:00:43] Now you can you must not doubt what he
[2:00:45] did for you. That's why he did it.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; He did it with a purpose and it's for
[2:00:50] you. Hallelujah.
[2:00:54] Wonderful.
[2:00:57] All right.
[2:01:07] It's the same God. He's living in me.
[2:01:10] Same God is living in me.
[2:01:14] [Music]
[2:01:20] Let's stand, shall we?
[2:01:23] Sing God
[2:01:25] spoke to
[2:01:27] the
[2:01:31] same God
[2:01:33] [Music]
[2:01:35] to many to tell.
[2:01:40] The same God who part
[2:01:43] [Music]
[2:01:45] [Applause]
[2:01:46] [Music]
[2:01:49] is the same God
[2:01:53] in me.
[2:01:57] Oh, the same God.
[2:02:04] away
[2:02:08] [Applause]
[2:02:10] today.
[2:02:12] [Applause]
[2:02:14] Sing God
[2:02:15] [Music]
[2:02:26] living.
[2:02:30] You know, I want to sing the verses, but
[2:02:31] I don't know the verses. But I think we
[2:02:33] can just mine some of the resources that
[2:02:36] are right here and maybe use them to the
[2:02:39] glory of God. Doesn't take long, just as
[2:02:42] long as it takes them to walk to the
[2:02:44] platform. I I couldn't remember who sang
[2:02:46] that. Sister Elizabeth Neighbor, you
[2:02:48] sang this. So, why don't you come out?
[2:02:50] We're going to help everyone. And
[2:02:52] they're not going to sing. There's some
[2:02:54] members of the choir. If you're free,
[2:02:55] just come and sing impromptu. We'll sing
[2:02:58] it for the glory of God. We're all going
[2:02:59] to sing it. Where's the choir? Out here.
[2:03:03] I'm just asking them to help me. I don't
[2:03:06] know it. And some of these, you know,
[2:03:08] they get certain time in them, and I'm
[2:03:10] I'm amidextrous,
[2:03:12] so I can't get on the right time.
[2:03:17] That's my problem.
[2:03:20] All right. My goodness. Here they are.
[2:03:23] Didn't know that we had so so many.
[2:03:27] Anybody else may not be in the choir?
[2:03:28] You want to join them? Come on up.
[2:03:33] We're full of surprises.
[2:03:35] Hallelujah.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Red Sea. We'll sing it once again. It's
[2:03:41] the same God
[2:03:44] living in. Sing the chorus once again.
[2:03:48] Oh, the same God.
[2:03:53] A woman at a well. It's the same God
[2:04:01] too many to tell.
[2:04:05] The same God who fight
[2:04:09] the raing ring.
[2:04:13] [Applause]
[2:04:14] He is the same God who
[2:04:19] me.
[2:04:22] I look back on history. I see a mighty
[2:04:27] God unveiled
[2:04:30] proving over and over.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; That his word has never failed.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; But I can't keep on dwelling
[2:04:42] on some past meories.
[2:04:44] [Music]
[2:04:47] But now I think God is living in me.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[2:04:55] The same God who spoke to the woman at
[2:05:01] the
[2:05:03] same
[2:05:05] [Music]
[2:05:07] [Applause]
[2:05:12] God who
[2:05:15] the
[2:05:16] Red.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:05:20] the same God who
[2:05:25] [Music]
[2:05:28] the same God who created
[2:05:32] all the heavens and all the earth
[2:05:36] came back living in Jesus. And there was
[2:05:40] power in his word.
[2:05:44] And now in these last days, I'm
[2:05:48] beginning to see.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; That it's that same God and he's living
[2:05:57] in me.
[2:06:01] The same
[2:06:03] sparted
[2:06:07] [Applause]
[2:06:08] [Music]
[2:06:11] [Applause]
[2:06:20] the
[2:06:22] [Applause]
[2:06:22] [Music]
[2:06:26] He's the same.
[2:06:28] [Music]
[2:06:32] Oh,
[2:06:34] the same God who spoke to the woman.
[2:06:41] He's the same God and wonder. There are
[2:06:45] too many to
[2:06:50] God who are the ra
[2:06:56] [Music]
[2:07:00] and he's living in me.
[2:07:05] [Music]
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; That same God is here.
[2:07:12] That same God that spoke to the woman of
[2:07:14] the well
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; and spoke to us here.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; There may be someone, maybe more than
[2:07:22] one. God spoke to you. You know it's him
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; and you need to develop it further. You
[2:07:31] need prayer. You need deliverance.
[2:07:35] You need forgiveness. You need
[2:07:37] redemption.
[2:07:39] You need to be free.
[2:07:43] We got men of God here that'll pray,
[2:07:46] pray with you, pray for you. If you wish
[2:07:49] to come, fine. But don't come unless
[2:07:53] you're coming with faith in your heart.
[2:07:55] I know and I'm convinced. I'm thoroughly
[2:07:57] convinced that that God that spoke to
[2:07:59] the woman at the well, that God is here.
[2:08:02] That God is present now. I'm convinced
[2:08:06] it's that God that spoke to me.
[2:08:09] I'm convinced that this is the day that
[2:08:11] he prophesied and spoke would be that
[2:08:14] would come our way that this is the last
[2:08:16] time. I'm convinced it's he
[2:08:20] that will deliver me. You want to come?
[2:08:23] We're going to sing it once again.
[2:08:25] There's a ministers are here. Brother
[2:08:27] Lance, brother Tony, brother Dier,
[2:08:32] brother Tom, others are here. They'll
[2:08:35] pray with you. But don't
[2:08:38] don't come just as a formality or a
[2:08:41] ceremony.
[2:08:42] Come if you are determined. This is it.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; I remember well the day I laid it down.
[2:08:49] It was all over.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; Right. That day it was finished. I was
[2:08:54] done with the world. I was done with the
[2:08:56] devil. And God knows. And the devil
[2:08:58] knows when you mean business.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; And something half-hearted doesn't work.
[2:09:04] It does not work. Never will work.
[2:09:09] Your own thoughts, your own plans of how
[2:09:11] you're going to do it and when you're
[2:09:12] going to do it. When I get home, that's
[2:09:14] what I'm going to say. I'm going to say
[2:09:15] when I get ready is what I'm going to
[2:09:17] say. You might not even have the chance
[2:09:19] to get ready. Now is the accepted time.
[2:09:22] And today is a day of salvation. What
[2:09:25] greater thing could God do today than to
[2:09:27] whisk someone out of the grip of the
[2:09:30] enemy and usher them into the presence
[2:09:33] of God and cause angels to burst out
[2:09:36] with singing and rejoicing.
[2:09:39] A son has come home. A daughter has come
[2:09:42] home.
[2:09:43] Hallelujah.
[2:09:45] As they sing it once again, the same
[2:09:47] God. Do you know it's your time?
[2:09:51] [Music]
[2:09:54] [Applause]
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; The same God
[2:10:00] [Music]
[2:10:01] [Applause]
[2:10:02] today.
[2:10:05] [Applause]
[2:10:07] The same God
[2:10:09] who is the Amazing.
[2:10:13] [Applause]
[2:10:15] Oh,
[2:10:17] is the same
[2:10:19] [Music]
[2:10:26] God.
[2:10:29] [Music]
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, he's the same God.
[2:10:38] Not too many to tell.
[2:10:43] The same God
[2:10:45] who pardons
[2:10:47] the
[2:10:49] resol
[2:10:52] [Music]
[2:11:05] [Music]
[2:11:14] [Applause]
[2:11:16] to tell
[2:11:19] the same God
[2:11:21] who pardon
[2:11:23] the raing red.
[2:11:26] [Music]
[2:11:29] The same God
[2:11:32] is within
[2:11:34] me.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Almighty God,
[2:11:40] it is indeed the same God.
[2:11:44] You're the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
[2:11:46] Jacob.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; You're the God of the prophets,
[2:11:52] the God of the apostles, and of the
[2:11:53] messengers. You're the God of the Elijah
[2:11:56] of this time.
[2:11:58] How many times, Lord, you heard your
[2:12:00] prophet messenger, our precious brother
[2:12:03] Brandham pray. And oh many of those
[2:12:06] prayers Lord I repeat because I know
[2:12:10] there is incense
[2:12:12] before your very throne. And now my
[2:12:15] prayer oh God and the prayers of all
[2:12:19] those that are present and all those in
[2:12:21] the invisible audience wherever they
[2:12:23] might be in the world. We blend our
[2:12:26] hearts together.
[2:12:27] We pray that your divine will and
[2:12:30] purpose will be done. We ask, oh God,
[2:12:33] you will receive now our confession. We
[2:12:38] believe that by grace we are saved
[2:12:41] through faith and that it is not of
[2:12:43] ourselves. We believe that as we
[2:12:45] confess, oh God, concerning what you
[2:12:49] have spoken of our own self, our own
[2:12:52] walk, and as I've attempted today, Lord,
[2:12:56] to give them a little preview of what
[2:12:58] the land holds for them and what is
[2:13:00] really there, I pray, oh God, your
[2:13:03] people will tap into it. I pray, oh God,
[2:13:06] they will be exercised. They will
[2:13:09] develop these things, oh Lord, and we
[2:13:12] will not remain children any longer. We
[2:13:15] will do business with you, oh Lord. I
[2:13:18] pray, Father, in the name of Jesus
[2:13:19] Christ, you will set free every soul
[2:13:22] that is bound. Let the chains now be
[2:13:26] broken. In the name of Jesus Christ, I
[2:13:30] speak to you that are bound. If you will
[2:13:32] now speak the name of Jesus Christ, you
[2:13:34] shall go free. The mighty conqueror is
[2:13:38] here.
[2:13:39] present now to do it. A habit binds you.
[2:13:43] A habit ties you down. Sin, Satan, and
[2:13:47] all of his attributes are broken.
[2:13:51] The shackles are broken.
[2:13:54] The lamb of God is present.
[2:13:58] The conqueror came from the tomb and has
[2:14:01] been resurrected out of history.
[2:14:04] He's not somewhere in the past. Dear
[2:14:07] friends, he's here now. And oh God, may
[2:14:10] that living presence now come
[2:14:16] surround each one.
[2:14:18] And as your people will soon depart,
[2:14:21] Lord, may they go in the glory,
[2:14:25] the victory
[2:14:27] of their mighty redeemer,
[2:14:30] conquering
[2:14:32] every gate of the enemy.
[2:14:36] Father, I pray for everyone that stands
[2:14:40] in need. We're here to meet needs.
[2:14:43] We're here, oh Lord, that the sun may
[2:14:46] shine in darkened places. We're here, oh
[2:14:50] God, that the fog of doubt and unbelief
[2:14:54] will be dispersed in the bright
[2:14:56] sunshine,
[2:14:58] for the sun has risen. And we say to the
[2:15:01] people, arise,
[2:15:03] shine, your light has come. And all we
[2:15:06] can do is reflect that heavenly light.
[2:15:11] Bless your people, oh God. Dismiss us
[2:15:14] and send us from this place with joy,
[2:15:18] grace, peace, and all the benefits of
[2:15:23] the land.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[2:15:27] Lord, I'm asking you remember Sister
[2:15:30] Esther Shackleford's family.
[2:15:33] Oh God, as this grand
[2:15:37] believer, this grand woman of the
[2:15:40] church,
[2:15:42] she's taking her place now with those
[2:15:44] that have gone on before.
[2:15:47] Others perhaps, many of them martyed,
[2:15:51] some burned at the stake. But here's a
[2:15:54] woman that has lived most of her life,
[2:15:58] right up to her 90 years,
[2:16:01] fervently showing the glow of the glory
[2:16:05] of Christ on her face.
[2:16:07] I thank you, Lord, for her life. Pray
[2:16:10] now, Lord, you'll be with all those that
[2:16:12] are today for the first Lord's day
[2:16:15] without her.
[2:16:17] You will strengthen them and be near
[2:16:20] them. And now as we prepare this
[2:16:22] afternoon, Lord, for this evening
[2:16:24] service and some have to drive on the
[2:16:27] highway, Lord, our brother Kim and Hetty
[2:16:29] Dingwall and those that are with them,
[2:16:32] ask that you'll give them safe journey.
[2:16:35] Watch over them over the long journey
[2:16:37] home in Jesus Christ's name. Dismiss us
[2:16:40] now. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:16:45] May the resource that is in you be
[2:16:49] extended to someone else
[2:16:52] as you greet them
[2:16:55] as they're uplifted by looking in your
[2:16:57] face.
[2:16:59] Hallelujah.
[2:17:01] God bless you. Why don't we sing it
[2:17:03] perhaps? Sing it again.
[2:17:10] No woman at the well.
[2:17:14] He's the same God
[2:17:17] is wonder.
[2:17:19] Are you ready
[2:17:21] to tell
[2:17:23] the same God who is the raing?
[2:17:30] [Applause]
[2:17:34] He's the same God and he's living in me.
[2:17:41] Oh,
[2:17:43] the same God
[2:17:45] who spoke to
[2:17:48] the woman at the well.
[2:17:52] He's the same God
[2:17:54] who
[2:17:56] are too many
[2:17:58] to tell.
[2:18:01] The same God
[2:18:03] who parted
[2:18:06] the raging west
[2:18:10] [Music]
[2:18:12] the same God
[2:18:14] is living
[2:18:16] in me.
[2:18:18] [Music]
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; You're dismissed in the name of Jesus
[2:18:22] Christ. God bless you. Go prayerfully.
[2:18:26] Go quietly. Go reverently. Amen.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Don't visit in the foyer if you don't
[2:18:31] mind.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you choir. God
[2:18:35] bless you.
