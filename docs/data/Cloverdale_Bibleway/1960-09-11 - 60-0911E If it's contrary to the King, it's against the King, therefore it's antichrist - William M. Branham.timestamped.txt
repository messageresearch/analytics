[0:00] now Christ is ahead of this Christ is
[0:03] ahead of this Messianic Kingdom and you
[0:07] can not organize a kingdom of which
[0:11] Christ is the
[0:13] head you cannot denominate a kingdom
[0:18] which Christ is the head amen hallelujah
[0:22] because Christ is King and you cannot
[0:26] take the intellectuals of a man and make
[0:29] an organization to which Christ will
[0:33] govern amen therefore any companies any
[0:37] peoples any groups of men that tries to
[0:41] organize the kingdom of God is going
[0:45] contrary to the
[0:48] king and if they're going contrary to
[0:51] the king it would be against the
[0:54] king so if it's against the king it
[0:56] would be an antichrist amen yes
[1:00] Hallelujah that's pretty
[1:02] rough if I had just a little more voice
[1:04] we' make that clear but in the days of
[1:07] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:09] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[1:11] should be finished as he hath declared
[1:14] to his servants the prophets
