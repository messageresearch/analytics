This atmosphere of worship, we'll just ask our brother John Andes to come and lead the congregation in prayer this morning. Brother John, [Music] just want to give a testimony and also a prayer request for sister uh Sharon Holur. Uh Friday night she was on her way to the prayer meeting uh from the border uh just coming up uh 264th and 16th Avenue and uh a drunk driver smashed into her car and uh she didn't even know what hit her and uh when she came to there just happened to be an accident just ahead on the same road and the paramedics came right to sister Sharon and was able to give her oxygen and and take her to the hospital and we just want to say thank you Lord Jesus tonight and her whole car just it was three feet just right into the back of her um car just totally smashed and into uh two or three other vehicles out into the intersection and God saved her life on Friday night and we're able to visit her yesterday in the hospital. Uh she broke her wrist. She needs surgery tomorrow morning about noon on the wrist and there's other uh bruises and injuries that the Lord will heal. But we just thank the Lord for sparing Sister Sharon's life. It was right at 7:10. She just happened to look up at her clock uh right before the impact and that's what she remembers. You know, God is mindful every moment of our lives. But we just want to hold her up uh today that God will just heal her. How many else have a need that you just like to worship the Lord and say, "God, I believe. I believe. I believe all things are possible, Lord. Lord, we're still in worship, Lord. This is part of worship, God. Lifting up our hands, Lord. We don't want a form here to choke out or clog out, Lord, the arteries of our hearts, giving praises to your name, God, for eternal life that's flowed down into our lives. Lord, we want to cry out from our situation, from our lives, every individual. How great is your mercy and grace to come to each one of us and come to us in our time of our seasons of our lives and bring us salvation. It was so rich. It was so full and it's free God that we can just rejoice God and lives can lift up hands today Lord with burdens on their hearts, needs in the congregation, but with one thing on our lips. Lord, we believe you. Lord, we love you, God. You're the only true living God. Thankful for a place we can come into and let off the pressure. We can praise your name, God. We can wave our hands. We can shout out hallelujah. We can say amen God that we're so privileged to be in the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit God and have your presence even now saturating this whole building going out on the internet God. You are mindful of every seed, every predestinated life. We want to surrender today God. We want your Holy Spirit, God, to let perfect faith arise in our souls as we are in the very climax of time. We don't want anything in the way, God. Any grieving, any sin of unbelief, right now, we confess it, God, and we want to put it under the blood, Lord. Your spirit could could have full reign even in our prayers. Even right now, every man and woman, every young person and old could have a connection with Jesus Christ. And you could come down and fill these vessels, Lord. Our hands are lifted up, God. Our hearts are speaking, Lord. Even out of our lips, Lord. Some are whispering. Some are shouting, God. But you know our needs, Lord. You know our requests. And we believe that you're already on the way, God. You've provided the way, God. healing, salvation, the Holy Spirit, and even the direction that we need. &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to thank you tonight for Sister Sharon Holer. This morning, God, Friday night, God, could have been the end of her life, but you've spared our sister. And as a congregation, we want to rejoice with her family that you've given our sister Sharon, God, grace and mercy and that you have given her, Lord, what a wonderful thing to be with her yesterday in prayer. So grateful, Lord, that you've spared her life. And Lord, that you would just heal her wrist, Lord, that's been broken and other complications and bruises and and and things that happened during the accident. We just feel your angels was all around her. God, oh father, even as our pastor conveyed to her the thoughts on his heart, how Satan has his reward, but sister Sharon has her reward, too. And we know that one day our arch enemy Satan will be destroyed and he'll be cast into a lake of fire. And how our hearts will rejoice as believers that our reward is eternity with you, God. and we'll be around your throne where we'll be rejoicing. We'll be praising you, God. We'll be so grateful for the day, for the hours that we lived our lives for you, God, we will have no regrets then. So, Lord, let us live in our liberty today. Our pastor comes forth, God. And as we hear singing and dedications and baptisms today, oh, what a full day we have, God. You are bringing life to your bride, God. As Boaz was married to her great Ruth, Lord, we're married to you. And we're not just gleaning anymore, but now we're married with you. And your very thoughts and your life is flowing right into our wombs, Lord, that we can receive it, God, all that you have for us. Bless every need, God, and every life. We just feel such a sacredness today in the sanctuary. May every life be impacted by that, God. May our pastor speak the words of eternal life that would be for every need. Just break it down to our lives, God, as you know, our bodies, our spirits, and our souls and how they cry out for more of you, Jesus. Fill every fiber. We want to thank you, God, for your dealings. Lord, we thank you, Jesus, for the miracles, the healings, and we wait upon you further for your glory. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats this morning. Sister for us this morning. We've got a baby dedication, some triplets. So, we'll have to give them a couple of minutes. I don't know if it takes three times longer to dedicate three as it does one, but I guess we'll find out this morning. Brother Marco and Sister Sharon and their little ones. We want to welcome all those that are visiting. Sister Sharon Gindo is she already on her way. All right. All the Sunday school children are going to come in and find their seats. We want to welcome all those that are visiting with us. I saw sister Sammy and brother Jason with us this morning. God bless you. It's good to have you here. Be baptized this evening. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Our pastor will be baptizing them. And any those that the Lord has been dealing with your heart on baptism, &gt;&gt; the waters are open. &gt;&gt; You're here. Expecting just a wonderful time in the presence of the Lord this morning. Remember our brother Kyle ministering over in Victoria and young peoples on Friday evening here at the church this coming Friday. God bless you as we have a wonderful day together. [Music] My faithful father, enduring friend, your tender mercy, is like a river with no end. It all overwhelms me. Covers my sin. Each time I come into your presence, I stand in wonder once again. Your grace still amazes me. Your love is still a mystery. Each day I fall on my knees. Cuz your grace still amazees me. Your grace still amazes me. Oh patient Savior, you make me whole. You are the author and the healer of my soul. What can I give you? Lord, what can I say? I know there's no way to repay you, only to offer you my praise. Your grace still amazes me. Your love is still a mystery [Music] each day. I fall on my knees cuz your grace still amazees me. It's deeper. It's wider. It's stronger. It's higher. [Music] It's deeper. It's wider. It's stronger. [Music] It's higher than anything. My eyes can see. Your grace still amazees me. Your love is still a mystery each day. I fall on my knees cuz your grace still amazes me. Your grace still amazes me. Amen. [Music] Appreciate that. Sister Sharon, Brother Marco, Sister Sharon, the children, don't you come. You believe our God does miracles &gt;&gt; and he does them so great. Let's sing that together as they come. Ask our pastor to come. You are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else like you. [Music] There is no one else like you. For you are [Music] There is no there is no else you might as well sing it once again. We may not. You are great. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] else like you. There is no like [Music] Amen. Well, this is a wonderful time, wonderful moment for all of us, I trust, especially for brother Marco, Sister Sharon, and their family that is here. Uh we're praying they don't start crying because they they're a trio. Uh after about 7 years, God gave brother Marco sit there Sharon an instant family and God was gracious beyond measure to bless them with the three healthy children and were indeed happy. grandparents on both sides of the family uh are believers and we're so happy for that. Brother Lex and Sister Tilly Vanenter and Brother Dave and Sister Marilyn Chabberonoff and we're thankful and happy for them. God bless them. I think the grandparents should stand if they would because they're a big part of this &gt;&gt; ongoing ongoing part and and also uh Aunt Sonia haven't even checking your hand sister Sonia forgive me uh sister Sonia and her husband Tace Tace had to remain in South Africa. But Sister Sonia, if you can believe it, I don't know if you've ever heard of this before, flew halfway around the world to help her sister Tilly care for these children. And they have their shifts. Brother Marco was educated in robotics, robotics. And he didn't know why he was studied robotics, but now he knows three minutes of this and down here and that comes over here and the diapers are over here and he just reaching everywhere and he he's got everything right down to uh uh right down to seconds. I visited with them and and everything happens around you. We're real thankful for that. Sister Sonia, I'd like if you would stand. We know you, but of course, this is an honor to you for flying around the world. God bless you. Also, the greatgrandparents, which is the father of uh sister Sonia and sister Tilly, their father, brother James Duplacy. We call him brother Dupy. I met him first in 1978. He came with brother Willie Ratif, his pastor, and brother Theo Rasmus, who has gone on to be with the Lord. They sat around our table, and I remember my wife co baked them a nice salmon. Little did I ever realize we'd be connected this way and have my granddaughter and brother Dupy's grandson standing here. and and of course, brother Marco just followed in his elder brother's footsteps who married Andrea. And so now we have Rickart marrying one daughter and one granddaughter and brother Marco the other. Well, I know that they're concerned about these children and we're not concerned about them. Good things come in threes and uh I expect this is a good thing. We have three children, Georgia Ray, Shiloh Pearl, and they're identical twins. And Wesley Joel is the odd one. I say that respectfully. Georgia. They thought a good deal about these names. Georgia is a worker of the earth or a farmer. She's not going to be a farmer, but she can maybe have a green thumb or get close to nature, a work of the earth. Rey is a lamb. Shiloh is peace and tranquility. to be at rest, to be at peace, to be quiet, to be at ease. And her second name, Pearl, is a word of great value. Wesley Joel. Wesley, some one of the West, but he's certainly in the West. And Jehovah God Joel daughter one is a worker connected close to the earth. Second daughter one is peaceful speaking words of great value and a son is to declare that Jehovah is God in blasphemous names. Brother Brandham said everything is perfected in threes. My wife and I have three children. Many others here have. It took us five or six years to do what they've done in less than a year. This is called an instant family. on a serious moment. Brother Marco and Sister Sharon have had a very deep and abiding respect for this message. A very deep respect for this message for God's prophet, the messenger, the message that was spoken for the ministry, for their parents, that goes a long way. It's not for the people so much, but the office that God has given. And Marco has been a real lover of the message. And I know that these children will be raised in the fear and the admonition of the Lord. And I pray that as I pray a prayer dedication, I pray that that respect that you, Brother Marco and Sharon, have will be passed off to these children. &gt;&gt; If they inherit anything, I pray they will inherit that. And I have uh looked to the Lord for something to say and very little came. I felt very directed. You stand here and as a servant of Christ, bless these children and bless this home. And so that's what I feel to do. I uh want to read some scripture and it is the blessing of God through Moses. And all the blessings shall come upon thee and overtake thee as these children have overtaken you. If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field. Blessed shalt be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, and the increase of thy kind, and the flocks of thy sheep. Blessed shall be thy basket, and thy store. And the rest of the chapter is too long for us to read. It's all blessings and curses if the people didn't keep the word of God. And this is a couple that have indeed been a blessing to the bride of Jesus Christ. And I'm not going to attempt to hold these three, but I'm going to bless each one individually if you'll bow your head with me. In the name of Jesus Christ, which one do we have here? Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; I stand here, Lord, as a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ before a father that is holding two of these children. We bless Georgia Ray in the blessed name of Jesus Christ that has been revealed in this hour. And I pray, oh God, that you will give to her, Father, the Holy Spirit at the earliest possible age she can receive it. &gt;&gt; I pray that when she comes to the age of accountability, her ears will well have heard the name of Jesus Christ multitudes of times in their home. Lord, if any child affliction comes upon them, their father and mother shall unite as one and pray for them and you will heal them. I lay my hand oh God upon shallow pearl in the name of Jesus Christ. I bless her. I bless these children oh God and they shall grow and be nurtured and strengthened. They will become believers of this end time message. Let them be examples of a shining brilliant examples. Hold them hold them in your purity oh God all the days of their life. Yes. &gt;&gt; I lay my hand, oh God, upon Wesley Joel. May he, Father, be live a life that will certainly declare Jehovah is God and there's none other beside him. Father, I pray that this family will be blessed immensely with the lives of these children. I pray, oh God, that mother and father will be filled with wisdom. And as you have given them, oh God, I want to thank you for the healthy children. I want to thank you for the wonderful time as sister Sharon has carried them all these months. Oh God, without a moment of sickness, oh God, I pray that that holy that holy atmosphere will be upon the home. Father, I pray that the mother and the father, Lord, oh God, as they speak of you, as they hear your word and hear your messenger, &gt;&gt; these children as they become acquainted with their mother and father's voice, may they become acquainted with the voice of God. &gt;&gt; I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. I dedicate each one of them. &gt;&gt; Georgia Ray, Shiloh Pearl, Wesley, Joel, back into the name of Jesus Christ to your care, to your keeping. And you watch over them when they're out of the eyesight of mother and father. &gt;&gt; You watch over them, oh God, when mother and father cannot reach them. You will care for them, oh father, and as you have given them as gifts to this couple, brother Marco and sister Sharon, they stand here to give them back in return to you. In the name of Jesus Christ, we dedicate them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Well, we couldn't take just a minute with that because I've told them whatever they plan to do, it'll be times three. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to have a song, right? Good. We got time to serve the Lord today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jason, it's so good to see you. We've been waiting to see you. I wonder if Brother Jason, Sister Sammy, and maybe their kids if you just stand up so we know who you are. Jason and Sammy Keane from Bellingham. [Music] God bless you. Amen. Sister Natasha, are you here? As she comes and gets ready, we'll just sing. Word of God, speak. Would you pour down like rain? Word of God, speak. Would you pour down like rain? Pausing my eyes to see your majesty. Be still and know. You're in this place. Please let me stay and rest in your holiness. Word of God speak. [Music] [Music] Whatever happened to tell death to us part? [Music] Does the home reflect the heart? Parents faces tell of worried minds. While children search, but they can't seem to find. It's time we took a closer look. got back to living by the holy book. No compromise without getting slack. You see, church won't go forward. It will just go back. We'll know the tree by the fruit we see. Serving God has no in between. [Music] We're either cold or we're hot. He said in his word, lukewarm shall have no part. It's coming down to in or out. Well, there's no time for all this playing around. We're going back to lost or found church. We've got to go back. We've got to stand our ground. We've got to go back to living true. We're going back to the absolute. Oh, back to where the church stands strong. Oh, back to where there's a right and there's a wrong. Back to where it's black or white. You see the difference. It's like day and night. We're going back to things above. love. We are going back to our first love. [Music] We're going to rise like a sleeping giant, standing tall in God's strength and might. Well, all the power we've claimed for so long, it has returned and we've been made strong. Oh, we're not looking to the right or to the left. You see these eyes? They're spiritled. We're going back to truth or fault. church. We've got to go back to Calvar's cross. We've got to go back to living true. We're going back to the absolute. Oh, back to where the church stands strong. Oh, back to where there's a right and there's a wrong. Back to where it's black. You see the difference. It's like day and night. We're going back to things above. We're going back to our first love. We've got to go back to living truth. We're going back to the absolute. Oh, back to where the church stands strong. Yes. Back to where there's a right and there's a road. Back to where it's back. Oh, you see the difference. It's like day and night. We're going back to things above. We're going back to our first love. We're going back to things above. We're going back to our [Applause] We've got to go back to living true. We're going back to the back to where the church is strong. It's back to where there's a [Music] [Applause] you see the difference of God. We're going back to Jes. [Music] We're going back to our first love. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Back. &gt;&gt; Back to this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Send Elijah the prophet. &gt;&gt; He'll turn the heart of the children back &gt;&gt; to the original faith of the fathers. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful to be in this atmosphere? &gt;&gt; Just bow with me as we pray. Father, we've taken time to worship, time to pray, time to hear these songs. Oh God, we thank you, Father, for Sister Sharon that sang and and Sister Natasha that sang and for the people that sang. We're not just singing words, Lord. It's a reality in our soul. May the Holy Spirit witness today that you are receiving this worship to you. We worship you, Father, in spirit and in truth. Pray that you'll make this day an exceptional day, a day of blessing. Every day is a new day. This is the day the Lord hath made, and we will be glad and rejoice in it. We thank you, Father, for this supernatural thing that you have done for our brother Jason, sister Sammy. They've desired so much to be baptized. And tonight, oh God, that will take place. and others that will be baptized. Father, our brother Ben Ao, ask your blessing upon him today, oh God, as they look forward to this time. Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, we've come here to hear your word, and without you, we can do nothing. You are the revealer of your word, Lord. You're the baptizer in the Holy Spirit. I pray that any that are not filled with the Holy Ghost will be filled. And those, oh God, that need to be refilled will be refilled as we hear and receive your word. Anoint us, oh God. Anoint speaker and hearers in the lovely name of Jesus Christ. We ask it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Well, if you were here Wednesday night, you will we're going to proceed further from that, but I'll give a little summary of it. You can turn in your Bibles if you would to Ephesians the 3 chapter and then we'll be turning to Ephesians the 2 chapter. First we will read Ephesians 3 14:15 and 16. Once you found your scripture, if you'll just look this way. I would like to make a few comments before we read. I appreciate you all coming on this lovely day, being here, and blending our hearts together. We want it to be pleasing to the Lord. Our message, the message that we believe and that uh our faith is founded on is uh and as a most remarkable supernatural gospel &gt;&gt; been commissioned by an angel. The evidence of the angel of the Lord and the pillar of fire were present all through the ministry and it was something that was recognized by untold multitudes of people. Prophecies were spoken and fulfilled. Brother Brandham spoke prophecies, spoke them in public. Sir, is this the time in December and tells of the experience that should happen and two three months later it has taken place and we have the opening of the seals as a result of it foretelling of it. It's a message that speaks of the change of our bodies. It speaks of the theophony body that you have beside you. In the ministry of brother Brandham, he was reaching out into the supernatural and actually making us very very conscious of the supernatural. There are people today in the world and they are constantly trying to discover themselves because there's a part of the human psyche that is hard to understand and is very mysterious. And I hope to be able to take some of that mystery away today. The book that has been written by Professor Ed David Edwin Herrell of Birmingham, Alabama. He's the professor of history. He said these words uh concerning the great revival which was taking place between 1948 and 1958. And being a professor of history, he wanted to determine how and to what degree did this revival change the face of America. And he began to take the lives of men uh notable men, revivalists and outstanding men that were known to the pop public and very visible people. Wall Roberts and AA Allen, I think Velmer Gardner, WV Grant, and on and on because there was a a host of them that perhaps you're not a familiar with their names except for a few. and he said and he told me personally as he traveled up here and I spent a day with him uh because I used this quote on a radio broadcast that we had and he happened to be tuned into that station on that day and heard me use his name and he phoned me that's how that happened and I asked him how is it that you I notice you've given your first chapter is on the two giants William Brandom oral Roberts and you put Brother Brandham first and then in the pictorial section of the book you have the pillar of fires that appeared over the head of brother Brandham in Houston, Texas in the Sam Houston Coliseum. Why did you put that as first? And he said, "Well, it that's that's because those are the facts." And uh in his prologue this I read these words. The two giants of the healing revival, William Brandham and Oral Roberts, they were remarkably different personalities, but they quickly recognized one another as the premier leaders of the revival. Most of the participants of the revival looked upon Brham as its initiator. Out of his massive union meetings in 1947 spread reports of hundreds of miracles and marvels. Brham seemed an unlikely leader. He had long been a pastor in a small independent Baptist church. He was introduced to the Pentecostal world by the despised oneness Pentecostals. His preaching was halting and simple beyond belief. But William Brham became a prophet to a generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. A small, meek, mild, a middle-aged man with piercing eyes, he held audiences spellbound with tales of constant communication with God and angels. That's why I'm reading this. Night after night before thousands of odded believers, he discerned the diseases of the sick and pronounced them healed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. as he was telling telling me about uh how the book came about and then I asked him how was it that you I identified William Brandon he said I'd never heard of him he said and I I just as a educator I became interested in seeing how America the whole population of America had changed because of this revival and so he said I began to study the individual or Robertson Tommy Osburn and Tommy Hicks and all of these different individuals. He said, "And as I was compiling my data and my material on these various men," he said, "I found a common denominator. It would be here and this one, up here and this one, over here and this one, but I found the name William Brham in all of these men's lives." He said, ' And I said to say to myself, how is it I have never heard of this person? And he seems to be in the roots of every one of these men. He seems to be the flame that ignited. He was the torch that ignited their flame. So he said, "I laid all my studies aside." This is right here at a dinner table in this city. I laid all of my studies aside and determined I must find out who this man was. And when he was done, he gave him first place in his book because he said he believed indeed he was the initiator of this revival. I say to you, it's not because Professor Harold put him first. It was because the angel of the Lord, &gt;&gt; a messenger from God, that God would cause the world to recognize it. &gt;&gt; And you and I have been birthed by a supernatural gospel. And it is a world apart, &gt;&gt; friends. Not because we're in another church or Cloverdale Bible Way has nothing to do with it. Because of the message you believe, we are a revelated people. &gt;&gt; We're in tune with another realm. &gt;&gt; The mass man that God has used has connected you &gt;&gt; with the supernatural, &gt;&gt; has connected you with the unseen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God help us as we read now Ephesians 3:14. For this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man. And I would like you to pay attention to the inner man. Ephesians the 2 chapter verse 13 to 15. But now in Christ Jesus, you who were sometimes were a far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition, which between us, having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances, for to make in himself a twain, one new man, so making peace. I will read some other scriptures I've not announced, but Ephesians 4 once again, please turn to verse 22. That you put off concerning the former conversation, the old man. Notice now we have the new man. Now we have the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts. and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. &gt;&gt; If you care to just turn to Colossians quickly the third chapter, we'll read two verses there as well. Colossians the 3 chapter verse 9. Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds, and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him. &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats. Thank you for being patient and standing. I wanted to be very pronounced today that we become conscious that we're more than just individual physical beings sitting here and you have your way of life. You have your own idiosyncrasies. You are made a certain way. You have a certain background after the flesh. That's after a natural birth. But we have a spiritual birth. There's not only the old man. This is the old man. And the old man, the old woman gets older day by day, but we have a new man. We spoke on on uh Wednesday uh concerning we led into this subject and how that God in the beginning began to create. We're talking about hearing the voice of God. The scripture says, for example, speak to my soul. What does that mean? What kind of feeling is that? Is that it's something that certainly goes far beyond just something penetrating our eardrums and resounding there. God spoke to to the substance of his creation. Now just turn your mind loose and let us go into what the scripture says, not what we've heard and what we've established before in our religious thinking. But God spoke to the substance of creation and it heard him and obeyed him. God spoke to the heavens. He spoke to the waters. He spoke to the earth. He spoke to man. and each in each case said very specific things just quickly as a summary now because I won't take much time with this just a couple minutes but when God said the Bible says and God said let there be light and when God said in the Hebrew he said is to not only speak or to utter because we have no we have nothing to relate to what the sound was, what the language was, if there was a sound. But the word speak in the Hebrew is to utter or to say in one's heart or to think or to command or to promise or to intend. Even if he had that intention, if he held that in his thoughts, he held it in his heart. He held it as a promise as something that he planned and intended to do that all is encompassed in the word and God said however God we we have no way of he as brother Brandham said he fills all time and space is too mysterious he had to become said that's why he become a son of man &gt;&gt; so we could see uh and have a window into this great eternal being who has given given us life. We could see him. He was a God of compassion. He was a God of that was a healer. He was a God that would deliver people. He was a God that could cast out demon spirits. He could send the insane back home free and whole. And he's the same God. &gt;&gt; And if he can get us to believe that, the more that we can believe that, the more we're in position to receive from him. And this God wants to give. He wants to give exactly what you have need of if he can get you to believe that he is there ready and here present with us to give it to us. &gt;&gt; And and the scripture says, "And God said, let there be light and let there be a firmament." And God said, "Let the waters under the heaven be gathered." And they were. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth." And it did. And God said, "Let the waters bring forth." And they did. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth of the living creature of his kind." And it did. And God said, "Let us make man in our image after our likeness." And he did. &gt;&gt; The creator is speaking to the substance of his creation. &gt;&gt; And whether that substance is has any life that can be animated or whether it was just substance, it obeyed him. The elements obeyed him. &gt;&gt; The potassium and the calcium and all of the things that make up the body, this obeyed him. How he formed man in his own image, how he took and formed us, we do not know. But the creator is speaking and giving his thoughts and his intention. And the prophet said it had to be a thought and then it became a word. And he spoke a word. Then I mo we moved on to the capacity of the seed, the children of God to hear the shepherd's voice. It's more than just a preacher behind a pullpit. &gt;&gt; It's more than even just reading a scripture. &gt;&gt; The shepherd knows exactly how and where you are &gt;&gt; and what you go through. And he who brought us here is prepared to lead us all the way to his intended lo direction or his intended destiny. &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm coming to that in just a moment. I want to sew that in your minds very quickly because it's important to me at this time. Jesus said when he was here on earth, "My sheep hear my voice." &gt;&gt; Well, there are many that heard the vocal cords of Jesus, but very few heard his voice. He said, "And I know them &gt;&gt; and they follow me. My sheep." &gt;&gt; Not all humans were his sheep. &gt;&gt; My sheep. &gt;&gt; Even said to his disciples, "Go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. &gt;&gt; Go to those sheep." &gt;&gt; It wasn't everyone whose sheep. &gt;&gt; You take the serpent seed. It's all through the Bible. It's one of the most powerful scriptures. My sheep &gt;&gt; hear my voice. &gt;&gt; And I know them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they follow me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The voice of the sign. &gt;&gt; When the angel of God spoke to the prophet, he said, "I'll give you two signs. One will be in your hand." I saw that. I was there. I was there. And he shook hands with the man. One of our elders of our church shook hands with our with him. And and and he looked up. He jerked quickly. He said, "Did you get that?" Well, I I didn't have any capacity. I didn't I wasn't given that kind of a gift, but he had in his hand. And then later when it came to the second pull, he just stood a distance from the people and revealed the secret of their heart. And as it was with Moses, if they don't hear I if and he says and it came to pass if they will not believe you not believe you neither hearken to the voice of the first sign they will believe the voice of the latter sign. &gt;&gt; So the sign had a voice. &gt;&gt; The voice the sign wasn't speaking wasn't uttering anything but it had a voice. &gt;&gt; And those to whom it was intended heard that voice. So it comes to a different level than just receiving something in our ears or hearing somebody preach or becoming emotionally involved or emotionally attached to something. This friends has nothing to do with your family being here, your friends being here. It is between you and the almighty, &gt;&gt; between you and the divine almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the sooner we become uh uh become convinced of that, &gt;&gt; I believe that then we're in a place where we can move on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's obviously a sound or a voice uh with greater intensity that can reach into the parts of our being not connected with the physical hearing. &gt;&gt; I'm interested that you hear me. I'm interested that uh that you understand the words. I've prayed that God would make it very uh pronounced to you, but I'm more interested that the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; will take the words and take the substance of the thought and inject it into your heart and soul. &gt;&gt; So he said to Moses, "If they will not believe thee, they will believe the voice of the latter sign." Jesus said to the disciples, "Follow me. And as I pointed out Wednesday, this had an incredible effect upon the disciples. They were actually, the Bible says they were casting their net. Actually, they were casting their net into the into the sea when he spoke. And he says unto them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men." &gt;&gt; And they straightway or immediately left their nets &gt;&gt; and followed him. You can't tell me that anybody who just heard a man walking by the sea saying follow me that that his life could have had that kind of an effect. They heard something &gt;&gt; that was far beyond the hearing. And that's what I'm interested in today. I want to say this message. If it had come out of a Bible school, you would need your eardrums to hear it. But this message goes far beyond the eardrums. This message is something that is so quick and so alive. &gt;&gt; Uh my wife and I speaking as we came here and she was just saying it's so amazing that within our congregation, within our church, the people are lovers of the word of God. &gt;&gt; And you go from church to church and you find people scarcely know anything about the word of God. It's a social club. It's nothing more than a social club, a time to get together and socialize. We do socialize, but that's only a side benefit. We are here because we love the word of God, &gt;&gt; and we love his source. It came from God. And we love that God has sent us a messenger that could say, "Thus saith the Lord." &gt;&gt; And we receive it as that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus spoke of others whose hearts had waxed gross and their ears dull of hearing. And I run into it all the time where people it it is as though they would even love to hear. They would love to have what you have. They would love to have the zeal. They would love to have that fervent spirit, but somehow it it escapes them. And I can tell you that the world and all of its religiosity and all of its programs, it has a tendency to dull the hearing so that people even want to hear. They want but they're escape and they they hear the same thing as you hear in the ears, but they don't hear the voice that comes to the soul. So, we're speaking of the inner man, the old man, &gt;&gt; but the inner man or the new man as it relates to the old man. I'm interested in the faculties of the inner man. &gt;&gt; You would not be sitting here today if you didn't have a physical body. And you would not be sitting here today if you didn't have an inner man. &gt;&gt; Amen. The scripture says, "If therefore any man be in Christ, he is a new creature." And the prophet gives that he is a new creation. &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away. And behold, all things are become new, &gt;&gt; and all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation. In Romans 6 and6 the scripture reads, "Knowing this that our old man &gt;&gt; is crucified &gt;&gt; with him &gt;&gt; that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin." &gt;&gt; The first man, the first man of creation was a spirit man. the first man. And God said, "Let us make man in our image &gt;&gt; and after our likeness." And when he was done, he had Adam, &gt;&gt; both masculine and feminine. &gt;&gt; So the first man of the creation was a spirit man. My question today and this is uh I've given a great deal of of thought and question to myself and I'm posing this to you. What is it that we are being restored back to? What is it that was in God's mind? What is full redemption? Where are we going back to? Are we going back to Adam and Eve post sin? Surely not. Are we going back to them just pre the fall or are we going back to what God formed when he said, "Let us make man in our image." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was when he was done that and he gave a general summarization of all of creation and then he said and he looked upon this and said this is very good &gt;&gt; and then he went into his rest. &gt;&gt; It was during that period we should be notified ahead as to what our destination is. What is the objective? I'm not interested friends in just playing a game. I'm not interested in just having church. &gt;&gt; I want to know why are we here? &gt;&gt; And if God indeed has called us, why did God call us? &gt;&gt; What is he calling us to? What is his objective? What is he plan? &gt;&gt; Any person working uh uh on a worthwhile project must keep the objective of that project in view. &gt;&gt; Now, the first man was a spirit man. in questions and answers. Now, you'll listen very closely. I'm sure you will ask the question, please explain the difference between the spirit and the soul. Is 1961. He said, "But the first thing you are a triune being." You are a triune being just like father, son and holy ghost. Father, son and holy ghost is three titles going to one person which is Jesus Christ and your your soul, your body and spirit. But it takes the three to make you. with just one of them. You're not you. &gt;&gt; It takes the three of you. &gt;&gt; Now friends, this is not a negative thought or negative statement, but we do indeed spend a horrific amount of time on the body. &gt;&gt; We feed the body, care for the body, want the body to feel right, want to extend its life, we want to give it enough rest. We do all these things for the body. But I can show you by the scriptures some of the scriptures which I've read will take on some new light that you have a capacity to hear and you are a person also within your soul &gt;&gt; with w with within your soul. &gt;&gt; Your soul is a is part of your being. &gt;&gt; It's the part of you that you do not fully understand. &gt;&gt; It's the part of you that perhaps is neglected. &gt;&gt; I say that again. It may often be neglected. &gt;&gt; We feed our body, but do we feed our soul &gt;&gt; and the needs of the soul &gt;&gt; and the other part of our body? We we know all about our emotional self &gt;&gt; and those things. I have a number of quotes and I'm put them on the slide for the purpose of being able to read them with you. Now that is that one which I just read. And I want to go here to number two. When a man gets saved, he's just about like the light that comes into him is about like this little white button on my shirt. It's simple so that everybody can understand. That's when God comes into the inner part of a man. In the inner part of a man, a man is made up uh in in the system of the tabernacle. That's the tabernacle of the Old Testament. In the outer courts, then the holy place and the holiest of holies, the shakina glory on the inside the veil. The holy of holies is represented by your soul. &gt;&gt; And that is the part God was not as concerned with the outer court which is your body. &gt;&gt; And he was not nearly as concerned with the inner court which is your spirit, your emotional being. &gt;&gt; He is concerned and where God dwelt was in the soul. Your soul must be an in incredibly significant and important part of God's association and consequently with the service. &gt;&gt; And each time we come here, we should know we're coming here to have our souls fed &gt;&gt; to receive instruction in our soul &gt;&gt; and have God speak to our soul &gt;&gt; and that we will become obedient to that voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now on the outside on the outside gates of a man there is five senses and enters that enters to his body. On the inside which is his soul or the soul he said is the nature of the spirit. I'd like you to notice brother Brandham he said as body soul and spirit and then towards the end of the ministry said body spirit and soul but did not change that did not change what he was saying about it. He says continually that the soul is the nature of the spirit. &gt;&gt; The soul is the nature of the life. And so I want you to notice that that is a that is an absolute the soul is the nature of the life. &gt;&gt; And so he says that here and the soul is the nature of the spirit that's on the inside of his heart produces his soul which makes the atmosphere around him. And he has also he has also five entrances as we say the memory, the uh conscience and the affection and the reasoning and the imagination. Then on the inside he has only one gate one entrance to go into the shakina glory where God can enter into him and take over control take over in the control tower and that way is through self-will whether you will or you're or not that's up to you but that's the way that's the only avenue that's open to the man that God can come into his heart is by self-will. puts him right back like Adam and Eve on the free moral agency again. You can choose right or wrong. Either one you do. If you are born of his seed, you'll choose right. &gt;&gt; You'll choose his word. &gt;&gt; And uh hear his voice. I think that we have this All right, just just take that one off for just a moment. In the message here, his voice, I'm laying some of this out first just to get some things established. He said, I was thinking when the soul has gone out of a man, what is it? He said, it's his inner being that has moved out. He's not dead. He's still alive. He lives forever and our loved ones who have passed on beyond this veil is in a body that we don't know what it is. It isn't revealed. This is back in 1958. And then I want to come to the token message here. Now the soul is the nature of the life. There is a life, a blood and a soul in the life. The soul is the nature of the life. Therefore, it had no certain it had no certain nature. Take speaking of the Old Testament. It was an animal the sacrifice back then because he's speak preaching on the token. Therefore, the blood stood for a token that the life had been given. But in this glorious place under this covenant, there is a difference between the blood and the life. The token, the token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; not a blood, a chemistry, but it is the Holy Spirit of God. &gt;&gt; That is the token that God requires of the church today. God must see this token. He must see it in every one of us. And then in questions and answers he's saying speaking now now the first man and please just notice how we're making a distinction of the first man the inner man the new man and so on and the first man now he made the first man in his image and we're returning back to that image &gt;&gt; now the first man. He made the first man in his image. And we're returning back to that image, to our first create created image. When God created me, William Brandham, I was be before the foundation of the world. He made my being, my spirit. I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know of, but I was there. Jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world. And Paul said that he chose us in him before the world began. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now, there was some part of me, he continuing on in this same uh paragraph. There's some part of me, Orman Neville, that's brother Neville who was the pastor there. and the rest of you all here that's in Christ Jesus before the world ever began and he said and here's to my analysis of that I think that the people today that are possessed with the spirit or the spirit a part of these angelic beings spirits were rotated off of God that never fell in the beginning and resisted the devils the devils lie in heaven heaven. &gt;&gt; You know, there was a there was a a number of them that were deceived &gt;&gt; and were deceived by Satan. &gt;&gt; I don't want to concentrate on those. I'm not going to be speaking about it. But there were some angels in heaven. Says, "Let thy will be done on earth as it was in heaven." Uh when when uh when Abel slew a lamb and put blood on an altar, that blood matched the blood that was on an altar in heaven before the foundation of the world. And that's why God had to have respect to it &gt;&gt; because he was seeing a reflection on earth of something that was in heaven. &gt;&gt; We are here today &gt;&gt; and there's going to be a people who Satan will never succeed in deceiving. And the prophet made it very simple. The bride cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; And there has to be reflection on earth of something that's already in heaven. There were angelic beings that could not be deceived. &gt;&gt; And Satan with all of his cunning, with all of his beauty, and almost equal to God except in creation. With all of his power, with all of his persuasion, there were some beings he could not convince to follow him. And it's re irrespective of what he has on earth or how sophisticated this civilization becomes. He will not be able to persuade some people. There will listen to me young people. There will still be young people if time goes on. There will be young people like you kids right here that will be in their teens and God will preserve them. They are the elect of God. &gt;&gt; And it'll be impossible. I don't care what Satan brings on, how how attractive he makes it, he could not possibly make sports attractive enough to attract even a a really qualified, skilled person who physically in the outer body could perhaps get a gold medal. But the inner man will say, "I'm not interested in it. I'm interested in another gold. &gt;&gt; I'm interested in the character of my master. Amen. &gt;&gt; I cannot sell my body, the outer man, out for this because it it won't mean anything &gt;&gt; and it's just for time. &gt;&gt; I want something that's eternal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's gifted people who have such incredible mental skills, such retention of their mind, they could they could attain to incredible heights in the world of all the old men, &gt;&gt; the old body, the old man. &gt;&gt; But the inner man is calling out for something that's far greater than that. The apostle Paul who was so well-versed and well taught under the greatest of teachers Galiel he studied there and Jesus let him study under Galo when God in the flesh was walking on the same ground. They no doubt crossed their pathways in that small country of Palestine. But Paul became so educated, he had such a mind, he had to have that in order to turn the law of the Old Testament to grace in the New. &gt;&gt; But he said everything that he had learned. All of his intelligence, he counted it as dung that he might win Christ. &gt;&gt; One was the old man, &gt;&gt; but the other was the new man. And God yet took that intelligence and used it &gt;&gt; for the glory of God &gt;&gt; and for the writing of the New Testament &gt;&gt; now God put man first in his image in his own image which was in an image of God. And God is a supernatural being. He was a supernatural man. And then he put him in five senses. And none of those five senses declare his heavenly home. Do I need to say that? &gt;&gt; And none of those five senses declare his heavenly home. Those five senses declare this earthly home. And God give him the five senses to contact his earthly home and not to contact God. But I can tell you that this triune being, God has given us senses to contact our heavenly home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God has given us senses to contact our heavenly family. &gt;&gt; We need to listen to it. &gt;&gt; We can just turn the lights up if you will, please. And these five senses control the human body but and two senses control the inside man. The inside man and that's faith and unbelief. And you possess one of you possess one of the one or the other tonight. He said, David said, "My soul followeth hard after thee. &gt;&gt; Thy right hand upholdeth me." &gt;&gt; Who is that? &gt;&gt; What part of that? What part of you? What part of David was actually what was happening in reality in his life when he said my soul followeth hard after thee and thy right hand upholdeth me. There is a part of us that we need to become more conscious of. There are people in the world and they speak of you know uh spiritualism &gt;&gt; and there's a certain reality to it. There's and we have nothing to do. There's people there who are, you know, they're so conscious of and in the world there's whole movements. I think the new age movement perhaps, you know, reaches out and people are constantly trying to reach out and and it kind of gets into a fuzzy area because it's it's out there someplace. That happens to be people in the world who know there's a great beyond. And and that's why almost all religions have a heaven someplace. and have a better place and a greater power and all of these things. Friends, of all of the religions of the world, there's none. &gt;&gt; And if there is, I I'm putting you under responsibility to come and tell me, there's none that I know of. one day in fact is I'm going to especially for you young people and those of you who have not done it I'm going to put on a a portion of the healing lines and have this messenger go from one to the other to the other to the other and speak and declare the very secret of their heart even one I'm just listening to and and he spoke and told her why she was there and and he said you're not satisfied with that because that's not why you're really Here you have someone else on your heart. And then he got right down. Who is it that knows that? &gt;&gt; Who is it that knows the inside of the inside? And then as he hears or he hears the vocal cords of a man speaking and they begin to break down and go to pieces and begin to convulse with tears. They're not listening to somebody with a seventh grade education from Kentucky. They're hearing the voice of God. &gt;&gt; They become consciously, they become aware, instantly aware, someone is here that knows me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's why he said so often, I don't know you. You're a stranger. We're strangers. Raise your hand. What I'm trying to get across to you, I'm not going back 40, 50 years just to, you know, to give accolades to brother Brandon because of that. I want this congregation to realize that person that knew that man or that woman knows you sitting right where you are today. I'm not him and you're not that person. But that same God that stood between those people, that same pillar of fire brought this message. &gt;&gt; That same pillar of fire vindicated this message. It was that same pillar of fire, that angel of the Lord, which is none other than the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ himself. He's the one who called you. And I'm announcing to you, you have something in you that could hear it. &gt;&gt; And you had and that inner man in you didn't only hear it, you knew what it said. &gt;&gt; And when he said repent, you repented. &gt;&gt; When he said this isn't the way, it's another way. &gt;&gt; And some of us have heard a voice inside. We've heard something. Others have been maybe just strongly influenced and inclined. And there's a there's influences right here in this service at this moment. &gt;&gt; I don't care what this service means to you. This prophet said the angels of God are here trying to influence you in an upward motion. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, are you giving yourself to it? Say, "Oh God, let the messengers of heaven, &gt;&gt; let me be influenced &gt;&gt; in a Godword direction. &gt;&gt; Let everything that might hinder &gt;&gt; be cast away from me. &gt;&gt; Let me be moved. &gt;&gt; Let us not be so earthly minded. Let us let us become heavenly minded." &gt;&gt; And say, "We become so heavenly minded, we're no earthly good." I'd say, "Praise God for that." Amen. &gt;&gt; I wish people would become so heavenly minded. There are no earthly good. &gt;&gt; He said there's two elements that make up the human being. And one of them is your mind. This is not the same quote I just read. And the other is your soul. And the mind is your mental thinking, your intellectual. And your soul, your soul is a part of God that's in you. &gt;&gt; This great eternal force, this one who fills all time and space. &gt;&gt; There's a part of that God, I want to say it would be my last words in life. A part of that God is in his children. &gt;&gt; It's in you. Are you his child? &gt;&gt; You have a part of that God &gt;&gt; in you. &gt;&gt; That God that creates &gt;&gt; heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; That God that heals, &gt;&gt; that God that defeats and casts out Satan, &gt;&gt; part of that God is in you. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; And if you can believe that, &gt;&gt; supernatural things happen right while you're in your seat, &gt;&gt; that God's greater. greater than cancer. &gt;&gt; Cancer is just a toothache. &gt;&gt; To God, this is God. &gt;&gt; There's no devil. &gt;&gt; People say, "Devil's been on my case." That devil is nothing but a bluff. &gt;&gt; There's no devil. &gt;&gt; This is God. I'm talking about the almighty God. &gt;&gt; And we as his children ought to give thanks and praise God to our heavenly father. We're here in a sanctuary where we can give him praise. &gt;&gt; We have breath in our lungs and strength in our body. Say, "Praise God, oh my soul." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Now I'm focusing on the soul." He said, "Your soul, your soul is what directs you. It's what you are. &gt;&gt; Your soul is what you really are. He said if you you've got a soul besides your senses, God never gave you these senses to trust him with. God gave you his spirit to trust. You will trust. Your senses is only a contact. Taste, feel, smell, hear, but to you yourself is that spirit that lives in you. Now, here's a highlighted. And when that's been regenerated, &gt;&gt; see, it had to be regenerated. And the old man died &gt;&gt; and the new man born again. &gt;&gt; That is a part of God. &gt;&gt; And then you become a son of God, &gt;&gt; an offspring of the creator. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, this is AB stuff. I've heard this. I believed this for years." We need to focus on it. We need to practice. We need to strengthen that part of this triune being. &gt;&gt; And then you become a son of God, an offspring of the creator. &gt;&gt; And then you can believe the impossible things. Friends, this is where I'm trying trying to come to because while you're sitting here, we need impossible things to happen. &gt;&gt; You need it in your home. Your family needs it. People need it. We're in the end time. We need impossible things to happen. &gt;&gt; Sister Karen Ficken's brother Lyall is lying in the hospital very ill, very sick. We need the supernatural. &gt;&gt; We don't need another church service. We need our soul to make contact with God and believe for the impossible. &gt;&gt; If thou can't believe, &gt;&gt; nothing shall be impossible. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We're children of God. &gt;&gt; Let's have it. &gt;&gt; Let's have it. &gt;&gt; Let's have the full benefit. Why walk down here with the old man when we can walk up in the heavenlies with the new man? &gt;&gt; Why are we all encumbered and worry and are troubled about all of these things here? This is passing. This building will be gone one day. Your bodies, this old man, will be nothing but a mere teaspoon of ashes. But the creator if we go by the grave will utter his same thought, &gt;&gt; his same intent that he had in the beginning. Because God cannot change his mind and he will call those elements back into the thorn he intended. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God's mind cannot be changed. &gt;&gt; He thought of you before the foundation of the world. And that's the form you'll come in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I feel beside myself. Friends, &gt;&gt; you help me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when he's regenerated and the old man died and the new man is born again, &gt;&gt; that is a part of God. &gt;&gt; You become a son of God, an offspring of the creator. &gt;&gt; Those words are too wonderful for me. &gt;&gt; They're too wonderful for my eyes to look on. We become a part of the creator. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, these aren't diluted words. &gt;&gt; This isn't mumbling something uh just of religion. &gt;&gt; This is a vindicated prophet of God quad &gt;&gt; that has declared truth. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, the world the world and all of its frivolity, it's a stench. Amen. &gt;&gt; It stinks in God's nostrils. &gt;&gt; We're sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For you are dead and your life is hid &gt;&gt; with Christ in God. &gt;&gt; In souls that are in prison, he said, "Now, it wasn't that your body died in reference to the scripture. It wasn't that your body died. It it wasn't your spirit died. It was the nature of your spirit died. The nature which is the soul. The nature of your spirit died. And the nature of your soul is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're born again, &gt;&gt; if it's not, it's of the world. &gt;&gt; We have a nature of the world. But our nature of that soul, the nature died and we're born again. &gt;&gt; Now the scripture tells us, following along close, friends, please. I agonized trying to bring my mind and thoughts into subjection even into the weariness of the night that we might have I might be able to bring it to you as as as I was feeling it within myself. Jesus Christ, the second Adam, the Bible tells us he poured out his soul, poured out his soul into death. And being in agony &gt;&gt; in the garden of Gethsemane, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground, almost like a precursor of the redemption of the earth, because his blood on Calvary fell to the earth and claimed that newly created blood of God, that blood cell that had never experienced sin. man that had come by a virgin birth. Sex knew nothing about this. He didn't come out of sexual desire. He came out of the bosom of the father. &gt;&gt; And God chose another virgin woman, a little woman that believed him. Eve displaced him by disbelieving. And he chose another one. Be blessed art thou uh because she was chosen. marry your chosen of God. And how will these things be? You'll be overshadowed by the Holy Spirit. And that which is in thee, that holy thing is will is conceived of the Holy Ghost. And she gave forth a son. And now that blood, which was God's blood by his word, for the prophet spoke it &gt;&gt; that a virgin would conceive. And the power of that word brought that blood cell. Hallelujah. It had it had been in the mind of God, but it had to be spoken. &gt;&gt; The thought became a word. And the prophet spoke the word. And the and the prophet, our prophet said, and those prophets words attached themselves [Applause] &gt;&gt; to the womb of Mary, &gt;&gt; and she brought forth a son. And now he's dropping his blood upon the earth. Why? Because the blood is the is the was the token and the life. He poured out his soul because that is uh something that cannot be described or to be defined. He poured out his soul because it was the soul that died. He lost his nature. He lost his God nature. Are you following me? Adam lost the way. &gt;&gt; He lost his God nature. &gt;&gt; And now we can say according to Isaiah 53, Isaiah's prophecy, who who would believe our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? And he was wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities. And the chastisement of our peace was upon him. And by his stripes we are healed. And he was he was with the rich and the just and his and the rich and the wicked in his death. But the Bible tells us he poured out his soul if he had not done that. In other words, he could say, "Children, the nature of the father is given back to you. I'm going to coast for a little while. I want it to soak in. The fierce a fierce struggle went on into the night. Some of you that write songs, maybe you'll get some inspiration here. A fierce struggle went on into the night in agony while great drops of blood fell to the ground. Jesus cried, "Oh my father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt." The Bible says he went a little further and he fell on his face and prayed saying, "Oh my father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I wilt, but as thou wilt." I can tell you friends. He didn't want to die or suffer what was hanging just before him. But without that, &gt;&gt; without the spilling of this sacrifice, &gt;&gt; there'd be no way for us to have access. &gt;&gt; And we may have had access, all right, you've been born again, but to be a to be made aware of what it is that's in you. &gt;&gt; I had a rem I have a remarkable clip. I wanted to show it to you this morning, but I perhaps at another time. It is really it's in a series of DVDs that comes from the Wisen Tall Institute. For those of you that don't know Wisen Tall, Mr. Weisen Tall who recently passed away and I believe he was he received the highest honor that America gave could give by the president and he was called the Nazi hunter. He hunted down uh the great men who were responsible for the murders of tens of thousands of Jews. Who was the one in Israel? They just had gotten had to one of the most main one in Israel. &gt;&gt; Pardon? Ikeman. Thank you, brother Ernie. Ikeman. He's captured several others and whisked them out of the country. Sometimes while it was known to the government and most times while it was not known but he wanted to show that there were other other effects of uh the Holocaust and the ongoing things and one of them was most unusual and it's called beautiful music. Excuse me and forgive me now. I just want to take time. Can I have a few minutes? &gt;&gt; And he tells of it just breaks into the family, a Dutch family, Christians that were doing missionary work over there and a person, I forget the person that came to them and asked them if they would take these two Palestinian children. So what he's tying together is here's people who have a love for Israel. The Dutch people are there to give their lives for the betterment of Israel, etc., etc. And yet they're being approached and asked if they will take these two Palestinian children. These children have been abandoned by their parents. I think the girl must have been like five or six or seven and the boy a little bit younger. And both of them were like demented children. And they were all twisted up. They had been malnourished and just everything. I can't describe them. It's hard to look at them because their faces are all twisted and contorted and they jerk and and impossible to communicate with. And they and they had a difficult time taking those two children and finally they felt that they should. So they took these children, had them in their home, and they show quite a bit about the children. You kids need to see it. Young people need to see it. You families, you need to see it. And and and and as they grew up, you know, they I can't describe them to you, but they're just twisted and contorted and jerk and their eyes and everything is you you can't communicate with them. And one day in the house there they they hear suddenly they hear symphony music and and Bach or one of the great uh one of the great uh composers is being played and and he he he and her have a conversation. They well somebody must have turned on the radio. And so they go into the next room and here's this girl who to their knowledge had never heard symphony music and she's playing flawlessly on the piano. &gt;&gt; This uh Bach or one of the great musicians and playing and they are in a state of shock. They can't even begin to comprehend where it's coming from. And I'm going to take a quantum leap now to the end of this girl's life. She becomes a teenager. And this family went and asked one of the leading Jewish piano teachers if she would teach this girl and she went through an enormous struggle and finally decided that she would take her on. And she taught her for quite some time. And then the mother, her mother who had adopted her or her adopted mother died of cancer and that was a great shock and she went down kind of into her into herself became reclusive etc. And then they had to have some you know encouragement and and this man remarried but didn't have the same attraction to this girl and she becomes a girl about 15 16 and she needed to be able to be funded and so this teacher who is a Jewish woman had a put on a benefit and the wealthy and the rich and the known people of Israel came into a great iator and that girl played. Now my question to you friends is this. It was just because it was a very outstanding example. My question to you is this. Where was that? Where was that music? Where was where were those skills? Where was it? She isn't that she tinkered and played on it and that they had some indication. and had no clue. It just boom, there it is. And she plays in this great grand theater to the absolute amazement of musicians and the elite of Israel. This isn't ancient stuff. This is recent. And when I say recent, I'm talking about this generation. and and that girl I don't know the end of it but they call it beautiful music and she she and the people I couldn't do nothing but give her a standing ovation my question is where was that we have people and you you're seating you're seated here you're not that and I thank God you haven't had to overcome that but you have you have if I were uh if I were someone who was an instructor of of athletics and I enjoyed athletics when I was in my teens and did quite well at it at school and racing and jumping and this kind of thing. I I liked uh that kind of sports. Uh I loved music. I used to play several hours a day. My guitar had opportunities to, you know, maybe play with a group or whatever more, but there was something inside I had no desire. I had no desire whatsoever when it came to the gospel. And I'm coming to something that's very moving to me. I have never been able to understand why I have an insatiable desire. I have been so blessed by this message. I'm so glad I've seen what I've seen. &gt;&gt; And for me to think, Brother Ernie, maybe there's someone else. Maybe I can get this into someone else's hands, a Chinese person or a Bosnian or a or a Polish or a Ukrainian or a Russian or a Vietnamese. And and that is why I just can't seem to do enough to to get it. It's with me in the morning. It's with me at night. It's with me when I preach. I just have such a joy. And why do I rejoice? It's not me. It's not the old man. But there's something inside, friends. And to me, that makes music for me. It's just music to be able to know someone else is hearing it. Someone else is getting it. Someone else is printing it. I just say, you may wonder what that means to me. I'd sooner hear that than hear Boach. &gt;&gt; I'd sooner hear that than hear a symphony. &gt;&gt; Someone's getting it. 100 messages went out. I don't I'm not rejoicing over a hundred or 2,000 or a billion. I don't rejoice over that. I rejoice over one. &gt;&gt; One got a hold of it &gt;&gt; and they trembled and the word the word was so uh quickening to them. They had an earthquake inside. &gt;&gt; How do you have four scriptures being spoken by a man and the whole scripture comes alive? No wonder the woman ran into the city and come see a man that told me all I ever did. He never told all she ever did. He just said a few lines, but her whole life was exposed. &gt;&gt; We have a soul. &gt;&gt; It's that God that's in you that's rejoicing. &gt;&gt; It's that God that's in you says that's music to my ears. &gt;&gt; It's that God that's in you says this is the real life. This is true riches. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible says who for the joy that was set before him. I wrote these lines and I was blessed. He was in agony praying father and the father heard him if it's possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done I don't know if he heard anything from the father perhaps the father said no it's not possible or perhaps the father was exactly ly as he is sometimes with us silent and we heard nothing. The sacrifice met the penalty &gt;&gt; on the background battleground. &gt;&gt; Nailing on the scarred and blood soaked earth. an earth that was groaning for the blood of just one more. The blood of redemption, &gt;&gt; the blood that can take us back to the original Eden. &gt;&gt; He must face the fierce judgment of a holy God alone. And that's why he said through the prophet, therefore I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death because he prayed played and paid the supreme sacrifice. It was the soul Adam this sin the soul that sinner that shall die. He'll be separated from God. And now it became united back. It became available. Friends, whatever you do, wherever you are, whoever you are out on the internet, don't be satisfied just to say, "Well, I've heard a message regarded prophet." It's more than that. &gt;&gt; He came. &gt;&gt; I've got a couple things I have to say to you. Do you mind if I keep you a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; I I have to say something. You're going to think maybe I'm crazy, but this messenger had to come. People think well the first pull the second pull of sunset mountain this that and the other thing. It's not those things are fine but it's more than that. It's that a messenger came ordained of almighty God with a word proceeding out of his mouth that could connect you back and bring back the nature of God to your soul. I tell you friends, then the struggle of the world is over. I'm talking about God life. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about God nature. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a part of God. &gt;&gt; And you become a son of God birthed into the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And you can never be lost. &gt;&gt; There's no such a thing as being lost. God will never lose a part of himself. No part of God is going to hell. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're the redeemed. &gt;&gt; And let the redeemed of the Lord say so. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I wish I could sing like you, brother Nathan. Brother Nathan heard. I don't know exactly where. Many years ago, the Lord gave me a song. Not much of a writer, but I have written a few songs. I wish I could sing, but the words are Terry here. Wait a while, watch and pray with me. My soul's exceeding sorrowful, burdened heavily. A dying world awaits my choice, longing to be free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Terry here, wait a while, watch and pray with me. &gt;&gt; The verse I can't sing. And Jesus went to the garden, but he went not alone. He took with him another three. And when the weight of our sin begin to burden him there, it's not exactly the words. Then he asked these three, "Watch with me. &gt;&gt; Terry here. Wait a while. Watch and pray with me. My soul's exceeding sorrowful, burdened heavily. A dying world awaits my choice. Longing to be free. So tar here. Wait a while. watch and pray with me. &gt;&gt; And three of his dearest friends on earth were weary and tired and they fell asleep and missed that moment. I'm just going to come to my conclusion. Just going to say it. I think you would agree there's not going to be another messenger. &gt;&gt; Then who's going to take us back to the original man? Who's going to take us back? Where's the voice? Where's the words? Who has, as I closed last Wednesday, who has the power of infallibility, &gt;&gt; who stood before untold hundreds of thousands and even millions of people and said, "Is it true? &gt;&gt; Is it true? Is it true? Is what I'm saying true? Is it true? Amen. &gt;&gt; Asking hundreds of thousands of people, first pull, second pull. And now here we are, children of the third pole. &gt;&gt; He said to all those tens of thousands of people that were getting something for the physical man, the outer man, the body, "Is it true? Is it true? Is it true? Is it true?" They said, "Yes, it's true. It's true." They broke down. It's true. They trembled. It's true. Here we are, a congregation, children of the third Paul, and I say to you, is it true? Amen. &gt;&gt; Is true. &gt;&gt; What he said is true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is the unfolding of the word true? &gt;&gt; Is Luke 17:30 true? &gt;&gt; This is a serious question. We're all We're all in a dying state here. &gt;&gt; Who's going to take you and I back to the original? He said the original. &gt;&gt; The original. And God made man in his own image. It was his own thought and his own intent. And now he calls you in this generation in the end time a world that is sinking &gt;&gt; in sin and death and corruption and uncleanness and perversion of every kind in this hellhole &gt;&gt; when hell has come to the earth. &gt;&gt; Is this God capable of bringing out a holy people? &gt;&gt; I say yay. He is indeed. &gt;&gt; And will he do so? &gt;&gt; He will indeed. &gt;&gt; And by what power? By the power of the spoken word. &gt;&gt; This messenger was sent to take you back &gt;&gt; to your original condition. &gt;&gt; He did not come to give you a better church style or to give you a better service or help you sing better or help preachers preach better. This word came and the truth is of it. It is here and it will speak to your soul and let you know I've come to receive you to myself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That where I am. &gt;&gt; Where is he? Where I am, I can tell you he's in a place of perfection. Where I am, there you shall be also. And when he came, who was he in attendance with? He said, "The pillar of fire is here." That's the spirit of Christ is here. I'm speaking to you through the pillar of fire. Who do you think brought this message? &gt;&gt; The son of man himself. &gt;&gt; He who could break the seals, he who could make the mysteries known is none other than Jesus Christ himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he came &gt;&gt; to get you. &gt;&gt; Not that he's coming. He's here. &gt;&gt; He's arrived. [Applause] &gt;&gt; To get you. &gt;&gt; To receive you. &gt;&gt; To himself. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. The message was to receive you. &gt;&gt; To receive you. It's &gt;&gt; It's not just a book. &gt;&gt; It's not just some quote. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is his receiving of you &gt;&gt; to himself, &gt;&gt; the voice of the creator in these last days. And he says that's where that's the reason Jesus had to come through the woman to bring it back to the original beginning again &gt;&gt; in marriage and divorce without sex desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's virgin born. &gt;&gt; But hallelujah, there will come a time where it won't be no more sex. &gt;&gt; But God shall call his children &gt;&gt; from the dust of the earth &gt;&gt; back like they was in the original. And friends, if we are going to link up with those the dead in Christ shall rise first. And we which are alive and remain shall be changed, you're going to be changed into the same form they are. &gt;&gt; And it is the Almighty &gt;&gt; calling them. Even if it's a teaspoon of ashes, &gt;&gt; hear me now, church. &gt;&gt; Oh, all who are on the internet orever will hear this service. Hear me. The voice of God in this messenger already spoke it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And once it's said and it's gone out into the heavens and into the earth, God God didn't need a second Isaiah. &gt;&gt; He said it first &gt;&gt; and a virgin shall conceived and a virgin had to conceive or God is not true. &gt;&gt; And the words of those prophets lasted 800 years and beyond. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And God had to speak it in this generation &gt;&gt; to reaffirm it. &gt;&gt; It already was written here, &gt;&gt; but he had to reaffirm it in our time &gt;&gt; to declare now is that timel [Music] &gt;&gt; friends. And I think this is the critical point. There's some that's going to catch a hold of that. &gt;&gt; Some are going to say, "That's for me." Some are going to say, "I'm not going to miss that." &gt;&gt; Maybe this girl could play this great piano music and all the symphony music. But there's something within me that cannot let that promise go. &gt;&gt; I am here and the power of God is here. The creator has spoken. &gt;&gt; What is it friends when a young man 27 as I was sitting and listening to another man? Is it his vocal cords that just spoke four scriptures that I've heard many times? I'm asking you the question, what is it? I asked myself the question, what is it that dissolved a thousand questions in my mind, troubling things and people have sat even after the last service and the sister sitting here had questions and said, "I heard the service and all the questions were answered. Who is it? It's not Edis speaking then. &gt;&gt; It is God taking the words, &gt;&gt; God taking his scripture, &gt;&gt; God taking his prophet's words &gt;&gt; and speaking to your soul. &gt;&gt; Your soul is a being. But God shall call his children from the dust of the earth back like they was &gt;&gt; in the original. I'm not emphasizing on calling them from the dust of the earth. I'm calling them back to the original. Yes. &gt;&gt; Not through any woman, but through the molding uh but through the molding of the clay &gt;&gt; and the cosmic lights and the petroleum. He'll create again &gt;&gt; like he did Adam at the first time. &gt;&gt; He'll create again &gt;&gt; like he did Adam at the first time. &gt;&gt; That was actually one of my key phrases. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus made this possible by God making himself a man and came into the world so he could die through this woman. Now is the testing time of sin. Hallelujah. We may think it's the testing time of believers, &gt;&gt; but I want to announce to you this is a testing time of sin. Sin's in a big struggle with the believer &gt;&gt; and sin is rising hopelessly defeated. &gt;&gt; Sin is defeated. &gt;&gt; Joy bells are ringing. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, I don't I care not what our families are. We go through individually. Catch a hold of what I'm saying today. &gt;&gt; That part of you that's inside of you is your soul. Satan has no access to that soul. &gt;&gt; He can make things difficult in the body. He can make things difficult in our emotional realm. Disregard it. &gt;&gt; Pay him no attention. &gt;&gt; Where's my example? Jesus Christ is your example. &gt;&gt; You think the prophet of God down here had it easy? He had more. He had more difficulties than all of us put together. And Jesus took the burden of the whole world. &gt;&gt; And when Satan came to him, he ignored him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somehow there's something in my soul today, friends, that speaks peace. &gt;&gt; Speaks peace. &gt;&gt; Speaks peace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. weigh your future out and your plans in the light of this message &gt;&gt; if you would. Let's bow our heads. Gracious Father, this is a marvelous moment, I lay my life before you, oh God. And as someone who has contacted me just very recently, someone who's been away a long time said, "I feel I need to dedicate my life to God again." Father, I trust and I believe that there are many here who perhaps feel the same way. we can't get. It's impossible for us to get too much or to feel as though we've gotten so close. We don't need to get closer. We want to get closer to you. I ask you to bless this people that have come. They have driven. They've crossed the borders. They've done all kinds of things. Lord, in this afternoon, we have a short period of time before the evening service. And this is not just a service, not church. We're people. Lord, how thankful I am that you have spoken to the hearts. Oh God, even from a young lad, 12, what you've chosen for him in his life, we know not. But we will we will be so happy and delighted to baptize him. Oh God, how your word has become quickened to our brother Jason, sister Sammy. Father, how remarkable are your ways. Oh God, you are speaking to our soul. &gt;&gt; And we say, "Yay, amen. I have heard." &gt;&gt; And we want to obey. Do what you'd have us to do. Bless the people, Lord, in this congregation. In Jesus Christ's name, I ask it. Amen. Sister Reena Wit, just going to have you stand a moment. The congregation see this sister. She's in the middle of a mall, Bellispher Mall, to do something, some banking or whatever. She's just there. Her mind isn't that some glorious thing is going to happen. But this woman here, Sammy, you stand. She looks on that woman. Sister Sammy, God spoke to your soul. He knew exactly what you needed. And he said to you, "That's different. That's the way it should be." And this woman approached this woman and began to question her, "What what religion are you and where do you go and so on?" And she saw a long hair and a long dress and something anchored in her heart. That's the way it should be. The devil wasn't saying that to you. The world wasn't saying that. Hollywood wasn't saying that. Fashion wasn't saying that. Vogue magazine wasn't saying that. That's what I'm trying to get across this congregation. At some time in your life, the still small voice just said, "This is the way." And sister Reena, you'll have a great reward for having lived as a Christian sister ought to live in the light of this message as this sister and her husband, Brother Jason, will go to the tank this evening. God bless you both. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; You think I'm not a preacher. You don't have to be a preacher. Right. &gt;&gt; Sister Sister Reena preached the message that brought her to the tank. &gt;&gt; And then we just broke down the message. We just spoke about what God did. Isn't this wonderful? &gt;&gt; Is this glorious? &gt;&gt; That's where the marvelous things are taking place. &gt;&gt; Come, Brother Derek, and help me sing. Forgive me for being so long, but I'd like to sing My Sheep Hear My Voice. Would that be all right? &gt;&gt; Why don't we stand? Change our position. God bless you. Do you have something to think about this morning? [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I know my voice and the path that I take. They follow wherever I go. My sheep go my voice and come at my stranger voice do they not know. My she my voice and my [Music] Oh my [Music] go my [Music] for my sheep. Oh my voice.

They abide in the home and go not afraid. They love me because I have made them my choice and they my oh my she [Music] my ask your brother Leon Leon if you'd come Please and pray a prayer in the message hearing recognizing and acting on page about eight or nine. Brother Brenham, he he uses the same phrase. He says, "My sheep know my voice." But it just it's kind of disjointed from what he's saying. But he's saying to us, if you read the paragraph, he's saying to us clearly, now listen. In the beginning, he made man. That's not this man that we're looking at today. Like brother Bram says, quite frankly, you've never seen me and I've never seen you. I'm wanting to get across to you today that your soul, your inner being, it's not some kind of cloud or fluff. It's a person. It's the real you that God spoke to. And he said, "The reason that he says it like this, something like this, the reason you have this capacity to hear is because you were elected." &gt;&gt; My brother and my sister, I want to emphasize today, you're a different kind of being inside. &gt;&gt; You go out of these doors, there'll be very few that you'll encounter that are elected. You say, "Well, how do we know that we're elected? Isn't that some lofty thought?" I say this to you. You were elected to hear this message. &gt;&gt; I want to I want an evidence from you when you heard the message or at what point did you hear the message? But was there a point when you heard the message that you said, "This is God speaking to my soul? Let me see your hands. &gt;&gt; This is God speaking to my soul. &gt;&gt; If you haven't had that, that's what God wants to talk to you. If you haven't had that, that's what this message is all about today. &gt;&gt; To announce to you that God created you, this body your mother and father give you, but God gave you a spirit. &gt;&gt; And somehow you've been attracted to this message. And it's God's voice to your soul. That being that one that this message came, this message didn't come for your body. That is why that is why. Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; That is why when that when brother Brandham moved from the first pull and and then when he was bringing the message, he said to the people, "Don't don't do that. Don't pull. I must give myself to the message." Why? The pull that the people were pulling on was for their bodies. &gt;&gt; I'm not here for the old man. &gt;&gt; I'm here for the new man. &gt;&gt; This bro, this open word now is for the soul. &gt;&gt; God was focusing now saying to his messenger, give them the final words. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why at the very end of his ministry, he's saying to the people, we ought to be notified, &gt;&gt; of what our destination is. &gt;&gt; That's why he was speaking these messages, notifying you of what the destination is and getting ready for that destination. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. Ryan, do we know the words that I just want to shout? Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus, for the love. Do we have the words to that?
