[0:06] God bless you.
[0:08] It's wonderful to be out with you in uh
[0:11] I guess weather that was or ordered for
[0:13] us. Rain.
[0:16] We come from a country where there's
[0:18] lots of rain and I feel right at home.
[0:21] Uh I'm here this morning behind the pull
[0:23] pit. uh I feel under the opices and
[0:28] under the mandate of uh pastor Tim Puit
[0:32] and uh he has requested that I should
[0:35] give some testimony this morning. So I
[0:38] will do so. Uh but I don't tell
[0:41] testimony as a as a series of stories.
[0:45] Uh there are parts of the testimony that
[0:48] are very very very precious and I can
[0:52] only tell in a certain atmosphere
[0:55] and that atmosphere will depend on you.
[0:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[0:59] &gt;&gt; It'll depend on this congregation and if
[1:02] the atmosphere is right then we can say
[1:05] more.
[1:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[1:08] the the the accounts that I will speak
[1:11] of are not merely about brother Brandham
[1:15] or about myself, what I saw, but it's
[1:19] about the one who did it.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; And and that's the unseen one.
[1:25] &gt;&gt; That's the angel of the Lord.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; And so I would like you to reverence him
[1:31] as we speak. We'll have a word of
[1:34] prayer. Dear heavenly father, we come to
[1:38] you in the name of the beloved son of
[1:40] God because you said this is my son.
[1:45] Hear ye him. And we desire to hear him
[1:50] this morning. We pray, Father, you will
[1:52] take the words of testimony
[1:55] and let them live again as it was. We
[1:58] pray, Father, you will take the
[2:00] scriptures and you will cause them to be
[2:03] alive for this moment. We ask that you
[2:07] will be glorified in all things. In the
[2:10] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I pray
[2:12] that you will take the reality and the
[2:15] truth and anchor it in the hearts of all
[2:19] that are here, both young and elder. I
[2:22] pray oh God that the reality as it was
[2:26] when I experienced it will be the same
[2:30] even this morning. We pray that those
[2:34] things that are needed will be
[2:36] experienced by the those that are
[2:38] hearing. May they hear the voice of the
[2:41] shepherd.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ we pray.
[2:45] Amen. Amen. I'm going to read a
[2:48] scripture if you'd like to turn with me
[2:50] in your Bible.
[2:53] And the scripture is found in
[2:55] Philippians
[2:57] the fourth chapter
[3:06] and we'll read from verse 8. In fact, as
[3:09] we're only reading verse 8,
[3:14] so I might have you join with me as we
[3:17] read verse 8 together.
[3:20] Finally, brethren,
[3:24] whatsoever things are true,
[3:27] let's read it together simultaneously.
[3:30] whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
[3:33] things are honest, whatsoever things are
[3:36] just, whatsoever things are pure,
[3:40] whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
[3:43] things are of good report, if there be
[3:46] any virtue, and if there be any praise,
[3:51] think on these things.
[3:56] this morning is all of these.
[4:00] &gt;&gt; It is true.
[4:02] &gt;&gt; It is honest.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; They are just,
[4:07] they are pure
[4:10] and they are lovely.
[4:13] &gt;&gt; And I shall say they are of good report
[4:17] and it will have a good response
[4:20] and a good effect upon you as you
[4:23] receive it. Amen.
[4:25] &gt;&gt; I feel while you're still standing, it's
[4:27] important to say that especially at this
[4:30] time
[4:32] &gt;&gt; when I know that you here, we we get in
[4:35] an environment like this and you know
[4:37] perhaps like to think that the outside
[4:39] world is there and we're never in
[4:40] contact with it, but I know that you
[4:43] hear many of the same things that I hear
[4:46] and the questions. I don't hear very
[4:48] much because I don't read very much. I
[4:50] use the internet, but I don't use it to
[4:53] surf. I don't use it to find out what
[4:57] other people think cuz I don't care what
[4:59] they think.
[5:00] &gt;&gt; I don't care what I think. Why should I
[5:02] care what they think?
[5:04] &gt;&gt; And uh I've seen too much.
[5:08] &gt;&gt; And I want to give you a secret.
[5:11] Anybody who questions anything with you,
[5:14] you tell them this one thing. Now, this
[5:17] is from an elder brother in this
[5:18] message. And this settles it. You bring
[5:22] one thing of the vindication that God
[5:26] gave this prophet.
[5:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[5:28] &gt;&gt; Just one time, even though he had it
[5:30] thousands of times, you bring one time
[5:34] where the revealing of the secret of the
[5:36] heart is done. And then I can start
[5:39] listening to you.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; Until then, don't talk to me again.
[5:44] [Music]
[5:46] &gt;&gt; Some of you were silent when I said
[5:47] that.
[5:49] That's not too rigid.
[5:51] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever things are true. How do you
[5:53] know those things are true?
[5:55] &gt;&gt; And so whatsoever things are true. And
[5:58] if you want to hear some of the
[6:00] testimonies, brother Brandham tells it
[6:02] that in spirit of truth, he tells a
[6:04] great deal in proving his word. He tells
[6:08] u some of the things which I will refer
[6:11] to and I don't think you'll find most of
[6:14] it in any of the tapes. Exactly. in the
[6:18] order that I will give it. So, God bless
[6:20] you as you have your seats.
[6:38] Now, this may sound like history, but
[6:40] it's not.
[6:42] I will start very early, but a man who
[6:46] was in the meetings in 1962, a native
[6:49] Indian man who was in the meetings in
[6:51] 1962, and I will relate that a little
[6:54] later on. My wife and I visited him last
[6:58] week.
[7:00] So, let's say that it's not historical,
[7:03] it's current.
[7:05] And in 1962, he was 19.
[7:09] Who's 19 here? Stand up.
[7:15] Well, we have three that were 19. He was
[7:18] your age. Thank you.
[7:21] He was sitting beside his mother.
[7:24] He was been afflicted by uh the demon of
[7:28] epilepsy
[7:30] and was constantly having fits. he
[7:33] probably would not have lived
[7:36] uh to be a
[7:38] middle even a middle-aged person. He
[7:40] might not have lived much longer with
[7:43] the amount of attacks. I had never met
[7:45] him up to that time but I knew his
[7:47] mother and he was sitting down in the
[7:50] meeting. It was no prayer line and I
[7:53] will just tell you this much and brother
[7:55] Brandham standing at the pull pit called
[7:58] him out. Called that demon of epilepsy
[8:01] out. I can't recall all the
[8:03] instructions. He even remembered more
[8:05] instructions than we had. And brother
[8:09] Brennan, I don't I can't say he declared
[8:12] him healed. He called that demon off of
[8:14] him. And then he gave him some
[8:17] instruction which he just told us about
[8:18] last week. He was in a red shirt and
[8:22] brother Brandham told him, "If that
[8:23] thing tries to come back, take that red
[8:26] shirt and cast it in the fire in the
[8:29] name of the Lord and you'll be free." We
[8:31] visited him last week. He's 71 years
[8:34] old. That was my first visit with him.
[8:37] And he said that that's what brother
[8:39] Brandham had told him. He he's not been
[8:42] in a congregation like you have. He's
[8:44] not had the min ministry that you've had
[8:46] or the tapes that you've had, but he has
[8:49] had this experience. And he said that uh
[8:53] that thing tried to come back on him and
[8:55] he took that red shirt and cast it in a
[8:57] fire in the name of the Lord and has
[8:59] never had another one till now. And he's
[9:03] 71 years old today.
[9:05] Amen.
[9:12] You may need some of this in the future,
[9:17] especially for you young people. I was
[9:20] 14. Who's 14?
[9:23] Would you stand up?
[9:26] I'll let her 14. Oh, there's more.
[9:29] That's a good age. I was 14.
[9:34] And 14 year olds, they are hungry for
[9:37] God and they also like to enjoy life.
[9:40] You may sit down.
[9:42] Someone else was my age and it was Billy
[9:43] Paul Brham
[9:45] and it was a meeting taking place and I
[9:48] didn't know anything about these
[9:50] meetings. I never heard the name William
[9:51] Brham and they were taking place in
[9:54] Vernon, British Columbia.
[9:56] And British Columbia is a a big province
[9:59] or state, however you want to call it. I
[10:02] know that Texas is the uh is the star
[10:06] lone star state and it's big.
[10:12] Texas has a square miles 268,820
[10:19] 268,820
[10:23] British Columbia is 364,764
[10:29] or 95,944
[10:32] more square miles. So, so long lone
[10:37] state
[10:43] and the only reason I'm saying that is
[10:45] Vernon, British Columbia is down toward
[10:47] the southern part and where we live now,
[10:50] which is uh down towards Vancouver
[10:52] Island in the Vancouver area. You go
[10:55] from Vancouver is almost 800 miles up to
[11:01] Dawson Creek. and where a lot of the
[11:04] testimony is. And Dawson Creek is only
[11:06] about midway in the province. And so
[11:10] then you have to go from Dawson Creek up
[11:12] the Alaskan Highway, which go which was
[11:16] constructed by the US Army during the
[11:18] war. It was a war project. and they
[11:21] pushed through 1,523
[11:25] mi from Dawson Creek to Fairbanks in 7
[11:29] months
[11:31] because the Japanese were invading up
[11:33] the Aleutian Islands and that was the
[11:36] reason for the Alaskan Highway. was
[11:38] built by the USD or US Engineers
[11:42] Division
[11:43] and and my father worked for them. And
[11:46] so I I lived on the Alaskan Highway and
[11:49] in the army camps and on various pioneer
[11:53] farms and so on. I know that may sound
[11:56] ancient to you, but you've had a you've
[11:58] have a country here that's developed.
[12:00] Sister Biscll and I lived in a country
[12:02] that was new, just being pioneered. her
[12:06] father was a pioneer farmer and then
[12:08] became a merchant. And so we we have
[12:12] lived a pioneer life. I I didn't have a
[12:15] dog when I was a boy, but I had uh bears
[12:19] were in the camp every day, every night,
[12:23] and I used to go and see the bears and
[12:25] throw sticks at them and so on. And and
[12:28] so to this day, I still don't have any
[12:30] fear of bears unless they're grizzly
[12:32] bears. and then you have a lot of
[12:34] respect for them. So I was 14 years old
[12:39] uh and there were and my father was go
[12:41] coming to a meeting like this only it
[12:43] was in a large auditorium and my father
[12:46] had been saved from Catholicism.
[12:49] So they always were interested in going
[12:51] to church, going to meetings, going to
[12:53] prayer meetings and God was moving in
[12:55] wonderful way. And so there was a a lot
[12:59] of ministers and flyers that were sent
[13:02] out in the mail and magazines. There was
[13:04] Oral Roberts, Tommy Osborne, Tommy
[13:06] Hicks, Velmer Gardner, O Jaggers and WV
[13:10] Grant and on and on and on had infinitum
[13:13] of all of these men. But I had heard of
[13:16] brother William Brham uh in this when I
[13:20] was 14. And so we came to the meeting
[13:23] early. It was in a civic uh arena where
[13:27] they played uh hockey and uh uh uh we
[13:32] just came and I was I was like
[13:35] 14year-old like any 14year-old you know
[13:37] and we we got a little cvy of boys
[13:40] together and and would you know just uh
[13:43] fool around and and run around and and
[13:46] one of them was Billy Paul and there
[13:48] were about four or five of us so we were
[13:50] just enjoying it and then when we would
[13:52] get to the get come to the meeting with
[13:54] my parents, my father and stepmother. My
[13:57] mother had passed away. So, uh, we'd
[14:00] come to the meeting and this was the
[14:03] first meeting I'd ever been to like this
[14:05] where it was just a big lineup of people
[14:09] and I thought, "Oo, what kind of what
[14:12] kind of preacher is this? What kind of
[14:14] meeting is this going to be?" And all
[14:16] these people lined up way way early of
[14:19] the meeting. So, we finally got into
[14:22] this auditorium and the bleachers up the
[14:24] side and the whole lower area was filled
[14:27] with chairs and filled with people and
[14:30] it was hard to get a seat. And so, we
[14:32] were way up in the bleachers and you
[14:34] know, us fellas kind of, you know, uh uh
[14:37] not too serious about what was going on.
[14:40] But I noticed the man who came up to in
[14:42] introduce Brother Brandham, he was a
[14:45] former pastor from Vancouver. His name
[14:48] Ern Baxter. You'll see his name in the
[14:50] books. And brother Baxter introduced
[14:53] brother Brandham and he said that
[14:55] brother Brandham will not these are the
[14:57] things I remember. He said uh brother
[14:59] Brandham when he comes out he will not
[15:02] begin praying for the sick till the
[15:03] angel of the Lord is here at the
[15:05] platform. And I that really perked my
[15:09] attention. I thought I have never seen a
[15:12] man that has seen or talked to an angel
[15:15] of the Lord. So uh after about 2 three
[15:19] days I I lost interest in being with the
[15:23] other young fellows and I I wanted to
[15:26] get closer. I wanted to see and I wanted
[15:28] to hear and this was one this was really
[15:30] the start of my spiritual existence I
[15:34] would say. And and I got a chair and
[15:37] that is a miracle number one. Chairs
[15:39] were at a premium. You couldn't get a
[15:41] seat period. And I got a seat right down
[15:45] the third row from the front where the
[15:47] brother with the checkered shirt is. I
[15:49] was sitting right there and the meeting
[15:52] was taking place
[15:55] and I don't recall anything of the
[15:57] service. I don't recall what was spoken.
[15:59] Brother Brandham usually didn't preach.
[16:01] There was a little exhortation that
[16:02] happened ahead of time and then brother
[16:04] Brandon would come out and call a prayer
[16:06] line and the prayer line was coming from
[16:08] this direction at this time and a woman
[16:11] came up with a with a daughter and the
[16:14] girl I would think would be about 10 to
[16:17] 12 years old and she had uh uh dark
[16:20] ringlets and coming down to her
[16:23] shoulders kind of full face and uh but
[16:27] but all she had for eyes was just two
[16:30] big white balls. And I was so close that
[16:34] I noticed that up in this up on this eye
[16:37] here, right up in the very corner, I
[16:41] thought I could see a little bit of the
[16:43] ball of the eye, but I wasn't sure. And
[16:46] so, Brother Brandham didn't have to uh
[16:50] do any discerning. It was obvious what
[16:52] was wrong with her. And I was quite
[16:55] feeling excited and enthused because now
[16:58] I was going to see something. All of
[17:01] these diseases and tuberculosis and
[17:04] cancer and things you couldn't see those
[17:07] things, but now I wanted to see
[17:09] something. So, Brother Brennan, he laid
[17:11] his hands on her and prayed for her.
[17:13] Then he looked at her, nothing happened.
[17:16] Prayed for a second time. Looked at her
[17:19] third time. fourth. I'm counting four
[17:23] times, five times, nothing happened. And
[17:26] my heart began to sink and I thought
[17:29] just when I get a chance to see
[17:31] something, nothing is happening. And I
[17:34] thought, this is like all other
[17:36] ministers.
[17:38] And then he prayed six times and there
[17:40] was nothing. And then I'll never forget,
[17:43] he just took and put his arms around her
[17:45] head and he prayed a prayer. Now,
[17:49] anybody who questions this message, I'd
[17:51] like them to pray that prayer and see
[17:52] what happens. And he prayed a prayer and
[17:56] he said, "Satan,
[17:59] an angel from God, ministered this gift
[18:02] to me
[18:04] and told me that nothing would stand
[18:07] before my prayers, not even cancer, if I
[18:11] could get the people to believe." Said,
[18:13] "The people are here and they do believe
[18:16] you. believe me and I adure you in the
[18:19] name of the living God to loose her and
[18:22] let her go. And that time he did not
[18:24] look at her. He just took her by the
[18:26] shoulders here and turned her this way
[18:29] to face the audience. Her eyes were as
[18:31] straight as mine are. And then he lifted
[18:33] her like this. And she's looking at the
[18:36] bright lights of the arena. And I was so
[18:38] close I could even see that tears were
[18:41] coming in her eyes from the bright
[18:42] lights because she wasn't accustomed to
[18:44] that. that never left me. Of course, it
[18:47] wouldn't leave you either.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; It never left me. And I was I was more
[18:51] than impressed. It was an anchor
[18:54] &gt;&gt; went down my heart. Then when I heard uh
[18:57] that was 1949
[19:01] about 19
[19:04] 57,
[19:05] I'm getting older.
[19:08] We're we're going to meetings. Well, I
[19:10] got married to my wife who's here with
[19:12] me and we went to brother Brandham's
[19:15] meetings in 1957 in Tacoma. And I
[19:19] believe the pastor was Aw Rasmmanson
[19:22] on under who I was ordained. And uh in
[19:26] those meetings, they went on I believe
[19:28] for 10 days. I'm not certain, but it was
[19:31] a miraculous time. And brother Brandham
[19:33] called out one native Indian boy and he
[19:36] gave the names of all of his parents.
[19:38] They were over on the other his parents,
[19:40] his grandparents and siblings. He named
[19:44] them each one like that. And that boy
[19:46] was blind also. And the next night or
[19:49] two I saw him going to the water
[19:51] fountain to get to get a drink. And uh
[19:55] so it was it was really remarkable. Then
[19:57] in 1958,
[20:00] uh a relative of mine had been a
[20:03] missionary in Cuba and uh and and he was
[20:08] up in our area because that's where his
[20:10] home had been. And he was there just uh
[20:13] uh seeing some of his relatives and he
[20:16] was helping me uh build a house. And
[20:20] while we were walking across the floor
[20:22] carrying a plank,
[20:24] uh, he said, "Have you heard what
[20:26] Brother Brandham is teaching these
[20:28] days?" And I said, "No."
[20:31] Uh, actually, I just be honest with you,
[20:34] I had I I'd started to get very
[20:36] discouraged. from about 1948, thank you,
[20:40] to 1958,
[20:42] had been uh been a tremendous, Brother
[20:45] Brandham refers to it as a revival of
[20:47] the restoration of the gifts and it was
[20:49] just an incredible manifestation of
[20:52] things. Just incredible. Uh in fact is
[20:57] in a meeting like this, if you don't
[20:58] mind, I'll just interject here. I was
[21:01] sitting over here uh right on the front
[21:04] seat in a little wee tiny church. I
[21:07] traveled 350 miles on a motorcycle to go
[21:10] to that meeting. There was such a hunger
[21:12] for God. Talk about all night prayer
[21:15] meetings. That wasn't nothing new to us.
[21:18] They had all night prayer meetings and
[21:20] manifestation of tongues and
[21:22] interpretation and all of these things
[21:25] and anointing. My goodness, just
[21:27] anointing. You could almost cut it with
[21:29] a with a knife. It was so uh evident.
[21:33] And we didn't care who they were, what
[21:36] they were, they were Baptist or what
[21:37] they were. That all had was meaningless.
[21:40] We never even asked anybody. It was just
[21:42] what God was doing. We never went to
[21:44] church to hear a sermon only. We went to
[21:47] church to hear God's word, but we went
[21:49] to church to see what was happening.
[21:51] Something was always happening. And I
[21:53] was sitting on the front seat and the
[21:56] service was over. And uh pastor, I don't
[21:58] I don't even know what the church was. I
[22:01] think he was I don't know what he was.
[22:04] They they certainly believed in what God
[22:06] was doing and it was just such an
[22:08] outpouring and uh and there was an older
[22:10] couple sitting right behind me. I had
[22:13] met them once someplace I don't know
[22:15] where and uh so we we just stood to
[22:18] greet one another and I turned around
[22:20] shook hands and and my wife had come.
[22:24] She wasn't my wife then. She was with
[22:26] her best friend, a tall uh fair-haired
[22:29] girl, a Norwegian girl, and they had
[22:32] come with somebody else, and I drove a
[22:35] motorcycle up there, and they were
[22:37] sitting way at the back of the church
[22:39] against the back wall. And uh I just
[22:43] turned around, was greeting this family,
[22:45] this brother and his wife, and he was
[22:47] just a raw boned older man. and he shook
[22:50] my hand and I shook her hand and the
[22:53] lady said, "You have something very
[22:55] heavy on your heart." And I said, "That
[22:57] is true." She said, "It concerns a young
[23:00] lady." And I said, "That is true." And
[23:02] she turned around and pointed to my uh
[23:05] who I wasn't even going with her as a
[23:08] girlfriend at the time. And turned
[23:10] around, she says, "The little dark girl
[23:12] at the back." The reason she said dark
[23:14] girl was because her friend was taller
[23:17] and very fair. said, "It's a little dark
[23:19] girl at the back." I said, "That is also
[23:22] true." Said, "Have no fear. God has
[23:24] given her to you." Well, praise the
[23:27] Lord. That was good meeting.
[23:29] [Applause]
[23:38] So, so those things, but then when the
[23:40] word came, not very many took it.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; So, this is what was troubling me.
[23:48] This is what was troubling me. How could
[23:51] all of this manifestation and this
[23:53] anointing and this powerful things and
[23:56] and true things and false things, things
[23:59] that we didn't know what to do with, you
[24:01] know, and uh I heard prophecies over
[24:04] people. They're supposed to go to my my
[24:06] sister and her husband supposed to go to
[24:07] Indochina. They went to Midwest of
[24:10] Canada. Uh there uh his brother and he
[24:13] were to go with them to Indochina. They
[24:15] went to Jamaica. Another couple went
[24:18] were supposed to go to the Arctic to the
[24:20] Eskimo people. They went down to
[24:22] southern British Columbia. My father was
[24:25] supposed to go to Africa. He never left
[24:27] Canada.
[24:30] What do you do with all these things?
[24:32] 14, 15, 16 years old. You just see and
[24:35] then you see things like, you know what
[24:37] I just experienced? Well, you're you're
[24:39] just going all over the map. You don't
[24:41] know what to believe. And then some some
[24:44] of my then I entered the ministry and
[24:46] got married and entered the ministry and
[24:49] some were baptizing in Jesus only. And
[24:51] some were baptizing father, son, holy
[24:53] ghost. I was baptized father, son, holy
[24:56] ghost. My wife was baptized father, son
[24:58] and holy ghost. And the man who led me
[25:00] into ministry says, "Well, I only see
[25:02] two. So is it two? Is it one? Is it
[25:05] three? Is it you know?" Well, we just he
[25:08] said, "Well, it doesn't matter." You
[25:09] know, nobody could sort it out. And uh
[25:12] but when I went to baptize some people,
[25:14] five people for the first time in you
[25:17] talk about a cold river. I mean my legs
[25:19] were purple when I came out of there and
[25:22] it was just a glacier river and it was
[25:25] fast
[25:27] and I had three men that were all over
[25:30] six foot. And so I said to I said to the
[25:33] one who later became a a deacon in my
[25:36] church, I said, "Now I always like to
[25:39] figure things out." I said, 'Now,
[25:42] I said, 'When I baptize you, I said,
[25:44] 'I'm only going to go in, you know,
[25:47] probably to my thighs, and I want you to
[25:49] kneel down. And he was big. He said, oh,
[25:52] no. He said, you're going all the way
[25:54] with me.
[25:58] I said, "No, Tommy." I said, "Listen, we
[26:01] we'll just go in. This river is cold and
[26:03] this river is swift. You just go into
[26:06] your up to your thigh. Then you kneel
[26:09] down and I said, "I want to baptize you
[26:12] into the current so I have the current
[26:14] help me bring you back up." No. He said,
[26:17] "You're going all the way with me." So,
[26:20] and he took a vice grip on my arm and
[26:22] led me all the way in. But before I went
[26:24] into that water, I had said to a little
[26:27] fellow that I knew had also heard of
[26:29] some of Brother Brandham's tapes. I
[26:31] said, "Have you ever heard how Brother
[26:33] Brandham believed in baptizing?" And so
[26:35] he said, "Well," he said, "I
[26:37] understand." And he baptized in the name
[26:39] of the father, son, and holy ghost,
[26:42] which is the lord Jesus Christ. He says
[26:44] the name of the father, son, and the
[26:46] holy ghost is the lord Jesus Christ.
[26:49] Said okay. So the first people I
[26:51] baptized, I baptized the name of the
[26:53] lord Jesus Christ.
[26:56] I've always been happy for that.
[26:58] [Applause]
[27:03] So now we're in 1957
[27:06] and the meeting's in Tacoma. Uh I'm just
[27:08] backing up for just a second. And in in
[27:11] that meeting while Brother Brandham is
[27:13] is preaching. Now one of the things that
[27:17] I hope this will convey to you. Brother
[27:20] Brandham says many times, "I'm in two
[27:22] worlds at this point."
[27:25] Now you young people, you're in one
[27:27] world,
[27:29] but I was had the opportunity of being
[27:33] with a man that would step into two
[27:35] worlds. And while I give my testimony,
[27:38] that's what you'll detect. He'd just
[27:41] slip into another world and speak from
[27:43] another realm. And that that always
[27:46] that's never been duplicated.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; That's never been duplicated. Not since.
[27:51] And we didn't have that all through the
[27:53] history that I can ever find. Not since
[27:56] Jesus time.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; And so in the meeting in uh in Tacoma,
[28:01] he said
[28:03] he just went like this. Tacoma, Tacoma,
[28:07] a bomb hangs yonder with your name on
[28:10] it.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; And from that time, Tacoma was a at that
[28:16] time Tacoma was being boarded up. It was
[28:19] postwar.
[28:21] It was just in a really dilapidated
[28:24] condition. But the United States
[28:26] government made it the submarine base
[28:30] for nuclear submarines. And it it is I
[28:33] can tell you right today it is high on
[28:36] the list of targets. If there's a
[28:38] nuclear war, there's a bomb. That
[28:41] prophet said there's a bomb with
[28:44] Tacoma's name on it. and people from
[28:46] Vancouver, Canada, actually went down in
[28:50] resistance to it being made a nuclear
[28:53] submarine base. And it's a large base
[28:56] today. And I met a brother that's a
[28:58] believer now who was a on a train that
[29:01] took missiles into that base.
[29:05] So, you know what's he doing? He's just
[29:08] preaching and he's rearing back and
[29:10] saying, "Tacoma, Tacoma, a bomb." and
[29:14] and I had goosebumps.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; You can imagine I would have goosebumps.
[29:19] So in 1958 then I heard that brother
[29:22] Brandham believed that this uh relative
[29:25] of mine said, "Have you heard what
[29:26] brother Brandham is preaching?" And he
[29:28] was a man of very few words. And I said,
[29:30] "Well, no. We've kind of buried oursel
[29:33] up here in the north." And he said,
[29:35] "Well, it's something about Cain being
[29:37] the son of the serpent." And I said,
[29:40] "Oh." I said, "Where did he get that?"
[29:42] you know, he said, "I I I don't know."
[29:44] And that was the end of the
[29:45] conversation. And it just like a big
[29:48] lead weight went down in my heart. Now,
[29:52] please watch carefully. This isn't not
[29:54] just not just a series of stories. This
[29:57] is what happened in my life. And that
[30:00] was 1958
[30:02] when that took place. And then in the
[30:06] next two years,
[30:08] uh something was taking place. And one
[30:12] day this AW Rasmmanson who was pastor I
[30:15] believe at that time in Tacoma he used
[30:18] to be in Edmonton Canada uh he and
[30:21] Matson Boze Joseph Matson Boz from
[30:24] Chicago were very dear friends. Now I'm
[30:27] saying this to you that I understand you
[30:29] must know the tapes in the books. Matson
[30:32] Boz was a very dear friend of brother
[30:34] Brham and so that was the connection and
[30:36] it was very very close to AW Rasmosson
[30:39] and Matson Boze and uh uh so when when
[30:45] this when this brother brother
[30:47] Rasmmanson came to my house once once
[30:53] once
[30:55] in my life I'm 79 years old once in my
[30:59] life this AWS came to my house on that
[31:04] very day was my good friend and a
[31:07] pioneer rancher by the name of Bud
[31:10] Southwick. How many have heard Bud
[31:13] Southwick's name in the books? Many of
[31:15] you. Many of you haven't. You want to be
[31:17] sure and familiarize yourself. And Bud
[31:20] Southwick and I were very, we were
[31:22] actually bosom friends. He was older
[31:24] than me, a little bit older. I used to
[31:26] go to his ranch and hunt. And uh we went
[31:30] up and had meetings there. And he was
[31:33] not a Christian. His wife was uh such as
[31:36] it was. They had five sons, all small
[31:39] boys. He was saved in my church and and
[31:43] we became very dear friends. Bud
[31:46] happened to be in my house that evening
[31:49] when AW Raspersonson was there and he
[31:52] just blew me away. He said uh he said
[31:56] the British Columbia government want to
[31:58] give me a big hunting territory.
[32:00] And I just brushed it off because Bud
[32:03] was just becoming established as a
[32:05] rancher. He had many horses. He was a
[32:08] horseman. He had many much cattle,
[32:11] probably 200 head of cattle and horses
[32:14] and so on and so forth. And a log house
[32:17] he had just built. And so the game
[32:21] department, I just wrote that off, but
[32:23] he stayed with it. He said, well, said
[32:25] the game warden and in Fort St. John
[32:28] want to give me this territory. It's way
[32:30] up the Alaskan Highway. And then Brother
[32:33] Rasmmanson said, "Oh, Brother Biscll,"
[32:37] he said, "you should you should invite
[32:39] Brother Brandham. He likes to hunt, you
[32:42] know." And he said, ' Then maybe you
[32:44] could have some meetings and kill two
[32:47] birds with one stone. And I I thought,
[32:50] well,
[32:52] uh, Brother Brandham, he probably gets
[32:54] 100,000 letters a month. Uh, he'd never
[32:57] see my letter if I wrote from But I
[33:00] don't know what possessed me, but I sat
[33:02] down and I wrote a letter with a pencil
[33:04] and paper and sent it to brother
[33:07] Brandham. And uh, I didn't hear. I
[33:11] didn't hear for months and months and I
[33:13] didn't expect to hear because I said
[33:15] what's my letter amongst all the letters
[33:17] he gets. And uh in the next year and a
[33:20] half I resigned pastoring the little
[33:24] church in Dawson Creek and I moved 800
[33:27] miles south uh to go and do missionary
[33:30] work amongst the native Indians. And we
[33:33] were only there about 3 weeks and I got
[33:36] a letter from brother Brandham's office
[33:39] and Billy Paul had written the first
[33:41] letter and he said that daddy would like
[33:43] to uh go on a hunt if we could arrange
[33:46] it. And then I have a letter from
[33:48] brother Brandham. I still have all of
[33:51] these letters. And it was March the 6th,
[33:55] 1961.
[33:57] And he and he was talking about the
[33:59] hunt. and he said, "I think we can just
[34:01] only do grizzly hunt in the spring." So
[34:03] that was our first hunt. And he he came
[34:07] up and we met him and he went on up to
[34:10] Brother Southwick's place and introduced
[34:12] him there. I was from from Dawson Creek
[34:16] perhaps. So we can get this map up. Can
[34:17] we do that?
[34:20] Uh,
[34:25] all right.
[34:31] Well, there you see Dawson Creek. Now, I
[34:34] was living off the map down here
[34:38] on Vancouver Island and going up here
[34:41] along the coast of the native Indians in
[34:43] these little areas, these uh
[34:47] little bays. And there's probably native
[34:50] Indians. They didn't even speak the same
[34:53] language. Down here there would be the
[34:56] Bamfields,
[34:58] then the Ullets
[35:00] and the houses, the Tofenos, all the way
[35:03] up the coast, Indian bands, and I went
[35:07] up that coast on that side for 14 times
[35:09] in the first year. Now, Brother Brandham
[35:12] wants to go hunting and the hunting
[35:15] territory. Here's Dawson Creek. We would
[35:18] meet there and drive Fort St. John. This
[35:21] is mile 300 on Alaskan Highway. And we
[35:25] drive to about here where brother
[35:27] Southwick would be. And then we would go
[35:30] from there by horse this way into the
[35:34] Rocky Mountain Trench, about 25 or 30
[35:37] miles by packor.
[35:40] This was the first time that that
[35:43] territory had been hunted other than uh
[35:47] under the under the jurisdiction of a
[35:50] native Indian band. And there was one
[35:52] family and it was a large family called
[35:56] McDonald's. He took a he took a white
[35:58] man's name and uh
[36:03] that's all right.
[36:07] I'm accustomed to grizzly bears.
[36:10] [Applause]
[36:17] And uh this McDonald family, they live
[36:20] down here.
[36:22] Uh there's some little lakes down there.
[36:25] It's actually called Moose Lakes. and uh
[36:29] uh
[36:31] the British Columbia government took the
[36:33] territory away from them and gave it to
[36:34] brother Southwick. They were not happy.
[36:38] So we're riding on our horses and we
[36:41] come to a sign, a little sign, and only
[36:44] one of them of the 17 children, 17 grown
[36:47] adult children. And one of them could
[36:50] write a little bit of English. And this
[36:52] is these were the words on a on a little
[36:55] board on a stake beside the horse trail.
[36:59] Go past this sign means blood.
[37:04] And so when brother Brandham saw that go
[37:07] past this sign means blood. We were we
[37:10] were the first white people. Brother
[37:12] Brandham was the first hunter that we
[37:15] that I knew of hunting on this
[37:17] territory. And brother Southwick was
[37:19] taking him in. And there's uh brother
[37:22] Southwick, brother Brham, brother a
[37:26] brother that brother Brandham wanted to
[37:28] have along by the name of Chris Berg. It
[37:29] was a trapper from our town and and
[37:32] myself.
[37:34] And so
[37:36] Bud Bud, this is the way Bud look at the
[37:39] sign. I don't know if he could even read
[37:40] it, but anyway, look at the sign and I
[37:44] looked at the sign kind of wondered what
[37:46] what do we do now? Go beyond this sign
[37:48] means blood. And he just kept on writing
[37:51] like he never even saw the sign. And and
[37:55] I I know that brother Brandham he he
[37:57] wondered he said he said to me later he
[38:01] said you know they have they have
[38:03] western movies of of they said they're
[38:06] reruns but he said this isn't rerun.
[38:12] This isn't a rerun. We're doing this for
[38:14] the first time. I said yeah that's
[38:17] exactly right. and he was interested in
[38:18] everything, how we tied our shoes and
[38:20] how we tied our moccasins and and and
[38:23] everything. And we were way in there
[38:25] about 2530 miles. And uh uh we're in the
[38:30] in the tent. We had just finished
[38:31] breakfast and I heard, you know, I heard
[38:35] pad pad
[38:39] out just barely faintly outside. And so
[38:42] I crawled to my hands and knees and and
[38:45] just part of the tent flaps and I just
[38:48] saw horse legs
[38:50] and I looked up and there's a native
[38:53] Indian on the horse and another one
[38:56] right beside him just like you see in
[38:58] the movies if you
[39:02] and sitting there and there I was on my
[39:04] hands and knees looking at the and this
[39:07] one very old Indian and another one
[39:10] right beside him and uh I said we got
[39:14] company and so brother Southwick comes
[39:17] up
[39:19] this that was the father of the whole
[39:21] tribe Charlie. Hey Charlie. So invited
[39:26] him in the tent and
[39:29] and he sits and squats down said would
[39:31] you like some tea? Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
[39:33] They just grunted and uh brother
[39:36] Brandham says to me, he says, "Ask, tell
[39:39] Bud, ask him how old he is." He didn't
[39:42] know. All he knew is 80 no more. 80 no
[39:46] more. He wasn't 80 anymore. He was some
[39:50] somewhere past that. And uh and and and
[39:53] and I'm now here I am. Please put
[39:56] yourself in my place with huge questions
[40:00] in my heart. I don't know about the I
[40:04] don't know about baptism. I'm wondering
[40:06] about that. Now I've been preaching for
[40:08] seven years. I don't know about the
[40:10] Godhead. I'm wondering about that. And
[40:13] this thing about the serpent said, I
[40:15] decided it was a bad rumor and somebody
[40:19] who was just saying bad things to
[40:22] degrade brother Brandham's ministry. And
[40:25] because I only the only thing I knew
[40:27] about his ministry is that angel of the
[40:29] Lord
[40:30] &gt;&gt; was there at the platform. And I'd seen
[40:33] this se the secrets of the hearts and
[40:36] and and brother Benham taking him by the
[40:38] hand at initially and then speaking to
[40:40] them and I thought you know that can't
[40:43] be duplicated. So now I'm watching him.
[40:46] I'm watching everything how his
[40:47] movements are, how he acts and when he
[40:49] sees people. That's why I'm telling you
[40:51] this first part. And uh and here's this
[40:54] native Indian. He's he's squatting. And
[40:57] the other one says, "Well, my brother's
[40:59] down at the river." Oh, there's not just
[41:01] two. There's three of them. So he goes
[41:03] down to the river and gets his brother
[41:04] and they're all sitting there.
[41:07] And the old man had gunny sacks, burlap
[41:10] gunny sacks for
[41:14] what happened? Stitched from here all
[41:17] the way down to here on both legs.
[41:21] And uh and he sat squatting and he sat
[41:24] perfectly erect. I thought he's doing
[41:27] pretty good for 80 no more.
[41:32] And we we put tea in, you know, bags of
[41:36] tea and his tea and he just took the
[41:38] rest of the tea bags and threw them all
[41:40] in his cup. I thought, boy, that that
[41:43] fell like strong.
[41:46] So I I'm just I I'm just eager now. I'm
[41:49] picking up everything I can. And then
[41:51] finally there, we gave him a little bit
[41:53] of lunch and they went on got on their
[41:55] horses and I was happy to wave to them
[41:57] and see them go actually. And uh and he
[42:01] swung up on the saddle and and they rode
[42:03] off. And Brother Brandham and I were
[42:05] standing there. Brother Brandham says,
[42:08] "Brother Eddie said, you see how
[42:10] straight he sits in the saddle?"
[42:13] He said, "Did you see the patches on his
[42:16] pants? burlap sacks on his pants. And
[42:20] those are the two things he noticed.
[42:23] The burlap patches on his pants and how
[42:26] straight he sat in a saddle. You might
[42:28] think, well, why why wouldn't he see
[42:30] some glorious or some deep thing, but
[42:36] just hang on.
[42:40] So, we have this account and we get back
[42:45] uh to the camp and uh then some some
[42:49] ride in someone rides in and says that
[42:53] Charlie's wife has got a something.
[42:55] She's dying. She got a heart attack or
[42:58] something. They don't know. And they
[42:59] rode Brother Brandham out and prayed for
[43:02] her and she lived to the end of his
[43:04] life. Those two people, Charlie
[43:06] Macdonald and his wife, both appear in
[43:08] the National Geographic magazine.
[43:12] And he was one of the original guides
[43:14] for the US Army to guide them in that
[43:17] area for the Alaskan Highway where the
[43:19] highway was should go. And here, Brother
[43:22] Brandham is the first one to be on their
[43:25] territory and and and hunting. And all
[43:28] of these things are kind of coming in on
[43:31] me. And so while we're still in there in
[43:34] the camp in a beautiful, beautiful
[43:36] place, just
[43:38] mountain glaciers on either side.
[43:43] And uh one evening, Brother Brandham
[43:45] says to me, he said, "Brother Eddie," he
[43:47] said, "Would you uh I think I'll just go
[43:49] out and see if we get a rabbit for some
[43:51] meat." Cuz we couldn't get meat in the
[43:54] in the springtime.
[43:56] And he said, "Would you like to go with
[43:57] me?" I said, "Yeah, I would." because in
[43:59] the daytime I had been going with the
[44:01] trapper friend, brother Chris Berg, and
[44:04] brother Bud had been going with with
[44:06] brother Brandham. So we went uh a short
[44:09] distance just walking
[44:12] and uh brother Brandham soldered over to
[44:14] a log and just sat down on a log and I
[44:16] just cuz I could sense he wasn't really
[44:18] interested in hunting and I wasn't
[44:20] interested in hunting. I had these huge
[44:22] questions on my heart and I thought if I
[44:24] can just get a chance to talk to him and
[44:27] we sat down on this log and uh and if I
[44:31] wouldn't open up any spiritual things
[44:33] because he was there for a rest I just
[44:36] wanted to give him a rest. How many
[44:39] remember the woman in the Bible that
[44:42] said to her husband this man of God she
[44:45] didn't know he had the it was Elijah?
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. She just wanted to give him a
[44:50] place to rest. Just wanted to give him a
[44:54] table, uh, some water, a little bed,
[44:58] just a place to rest. Friends, that's
[45:02] all I had in my mind. I just give this
[45:05] man I already had this big questions in
[45:08] my heart and especially on the serpent
[45:10] seed. And so I read Genesis 4:1. I
[45:14] memorized it. Genesis 4:1. And Adam knew
[45:18] his wife, and she conceived and brought
[45:21] forth a son called his name Cain. For
[45:24] I've received a man from the Lord. To
[45:26] me, that settled it. If Brother Brandham
[45:29] tried to circumvent or go around that
[45:31] scripture, I just thought that would be
[45:33] the end of our friendship.
[45:35] And so, that was really troubling me.
[45:39] And there I am. You can understand. And
[45:41] I thought for a moment any time he might
[45:45] look at me as he did on the platform and
[45:48] say, "You rascal,
[45:50] you don't believe." You know, and I had
[45:53] that on me as well. I I I had a fear of
[45:57] being exposed and I had a fear of him
[46:00] being wrong. And then finally
[46:03] he said, uh, I said, "Brother Brandon,
[46:07] how how is it that people can be, you
[46:10] know, anointed?" And I said, "I do know
[46:12] what the anointing is." And I said,
[46:14] "They can prophesy and they speak in
[46:16] tongues and they interpret pro prophecy
[46:20] and all of these things going on." And I
[46:22] said, "And preach and they are anointed.
[46:25] I can tell that they're anointed." But I
[46:27] said, "Their lives don't measure up with
[46:29] the word of God." And he said, "Well,
[46:31] Brother Eddie," he said, "Uh, the
[46:34] scripture says that the rain falls on
[46:36] the just and the unjust." And I said,
[46:38] 'Yeah, I I knew the scripture well, but
[46:40] it, you know, it didn't have the same
[46:42] emphasis with me. He says, and he said,
[46:45] "You tell me what the wheat rejoiced in.
[46:49] I'll tell you what the tears rejoiced
[46:51] in. You tell me what what strengthened
[46:54] the wheat and I'll tell you what
[46:56] strengthened the tears." And I said,
[46:58] "Yeah, okay." You know, and then he
[47:00] said, "In the last days, says God, I'll
[47:03] pour out my spirit upon." And I said,
[47:06] "All." He said, "A ll flesh. Not all
[47:09] flesh is saved, but he said, I'll pour
[47:12] out my spirit upon all flesh." And I,
[47:14] "Yeah, okay. I could I could understand
[47:17] that." And then he went to a third
[47:20] scripture. And then he went to a fourth
[47:22] scripture. By the time he got to the
[47:24] fourth scripture, and I could I could
[47:27] give you at least three of those
[47:28] scriptures, but by the time he got to
[47:30] the fourth scripture, it just like every
[47:33] question vanished. It it literally
[47:35] evaporated.
[47:38] He said, "You know, Brother Eddie, I was
[47:39] riding on my horse behind Brother
[47:42] Southwick this afternoon." He said, "I I
[47:44] I believe it was on this mountain here."
[47:47] And he pointed just behind me. He said,
[47:49] "The sun was shining down
[47:52] real nice and warm." Said he he came to
[47:56] me there and I had heard him at the
[47:59] pulpit. Now I'm getting down
[48:03] where you want to listen.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; And I had heard him at the pulpit say,
[48:08] "He's here." And I knew then that there
[48:11] was nothing
[48:13] that could hide from that man. And when
[48:16] he said he came to me there, now he's
[48:18] sitting right here.
[48:20] And I just looked at him.
[48:23] Looked at him right in the eyes.
[48:26] And and I have to be honest with you
[48:28] now, the scripture went through my mind
[48:31] in Daniel where his eyes were like
[48:34] candles that burn so intensely
[48:41] and I was naked.
[48:44] I was absolutely exposed.
[48:49] Not be and his eyes were not
[48:52] his eyes were not dancing. His eyes were
[48:54] not glittering. His eyes were not
[48:56] flashing, just deep set intensity.
[49:02] Brother Puit, I knew there was nothing
[49:05] hidden in my life from the earliest
[49:08] memory that I had.
[49:12] And yet the eyes had conveyed a
[49:14] compassion.
[49:16] And he said, "I believe you have three
[49:19] questions you want to ask me." And the
[49:23] first one is the Godhead.
[49:26] And he took them in the order they were
[49:28] stacked in my heart. And he said, "And
[49:30] the second one is on the first one is on
[49:32] baptism
[49:34] and the second was on the Godhead and
[49:37] the third one is on the serpent seed."
[49:40] Friends, I was so
[49:42] I was so wound up. I was so tense.
[49:47] I was so afraid because I didn't want to
[49:51] be disappointed that this man that I had
[49:54] kind of the last of the move of God. But
[49:58] I was like a young man hanging on to a
[50:00] life raft
[50:02] and I thought that his life if I didn't
[50:05] want anybody to take that away but if he
[50:07] believed this thing about Cain and the
[50:10] son of the serpent I just I just to me
[50:13] in those days we never even used the
[50:15] word sex over the over the pulpit. We
[50:18] just were it was the promiscuous society
[50:21] hadn't arrived and we just considered
[50:24] those place too sacred for those things.
[50:28] And so I said, "But brother Brandham,"
[50:31] and I'm sorry I raised my finger, which
[50:33] I did. I said, "But brother Brham," I
[50:35] said, "The scripture says, "And Adam
[50:37] knew his wife and she conceived and bare
[50:40] a son and called his name Cain and and
[50:43] said, I've received a man from the
[50:45] Lord." Brother Brandham said, "Brother
[50:48] Ready, that's exactly right."
[50:51] I thought, "How can you say that? You
[50:54] took my defense away.
[50:57] You agreed with me." And and just as I
[51:00] was thinking that, he said, "But you
[51:02] need to read the next verse." I didn't
[51:04] know what the next verse was.
[51:07] He says, "And she again bare his brother
[51:09] Abel." He said, "They were twins."
[51:13] thought, "Oh,
[51:15] I've missed something." No revelation.
[51:18] Said, "I just missed something." So I
[51:20] said, "Oh," he said, "It's always been
[51:22] twins. Cain and Abel and Ishmamail and
[51:26] Isaac and Jacob and Esau and Jesus and
[51:31] Judas." And I realized I realized there
[51:34] was no problem that they weren't twins
[51:37] from the same womb always, but they were
[51:39] twins. He says they arrived at the same
[51:41] time and left about the same time. He
[51:45] said he said a lot of people think three
[51:47] died at Calvary, but he said there were
[51:50] four. He said Jesus took one thief with
[51:55] him and Judas the son of predition took
[51:58] one thief with him. Went like that. See,
[52:02] there was four that died.
[52:05] All I knew I was seeing things
[52:09] I had never seen.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; And the questions I had vanished. And
[52:14] yet
[52:16] the other thing was that I had a
[52:18] realization. I'm missing something. I'm
[52:22] missing a whole lot.
[52:24] And then he said, "You pray and be real
[52:27] sincere." Brother Eddie said, "These
[52:29] things can only come by divine
[52:32] revelation. and I'll pray for you, too.
[52:35] And I believe God will reveal it to you.
[52:38] It was about 4 months later. I was at
[52:40] home. I was reading my Bible and I was
[52:44] reading in the New Testament, not in the
[52:46] Old Testament. In the New Testament and
[52:48] Apostle Paul says in I think it's 2
[52:50] Corinthians 11.
[52:53] Bear with me in my folly and indeed bear
[52:55] with me for I am jealous over you with a
[52:58] godly jealousy. For I have espoused you
[53:02] to one husband, that I may present you
[53:05] as a chasteed virgin to Christ, but I
[53:09] fear lest as the serpent beguiled Eve,
[53:12] so your mind should be corrupted from
[53:14] the simplicity that is in Christ. Mine
[53:17] said what? She didn't get a headache.
[53:20] That wasn't what happened.
[53:23] And and and I thought if English means
[53:25] anything, if if Eve was married to one
[53:30] husband, she was a spouse to one husband
[53:33] and uh and and she was chased and she
[53:37] was a virgin. If she remained a virgin
[53:40] after Satan came, then English has
[53:43] completely lost its meaning.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; She couldn't possibly be a virgin. He
[53:48] Paul is saying, "I'm jealous over you, a
[53:50] Corinthian church." And the church is a
[53:52] woman. Church is a feminine gender. I'm
[53:55] I'm I'm jealous over you. I'm zealous
[53:57] over you as a as a a from his office.
[54:02] And and that I may present you as a
[54:04] chasteed virgin to Christ. But I fear
[54:08] less as the serpent beguiled Eve. And
[54:11] and then I just then it opened up. Not
[54:15] opened up. I didn't study it. I didn't
[54:17] even study it. It just opened up. It was
[54:19] just like a flash of light from Genesis
[54:22] to Revelation. Then I understood the
[54:25] blood sacrifice. I understood the
[54:27] circumcision and the Old Testament. I
[54:30] understood what Calvary was all about. I
[54:32] could understand why we had to be washed
[54:35] in the blood. I could I just begin to
[54:37] understand that it's become a pillar
[54:39] truth. I tell you what, friends, the
[54:41] serpent seat is a pillar truth. And I
[54:44] have said publicly and we'll say again
[54:45] this morning that that if if time should
[54:48] go on, Brother Brandon would go down in
[54:51] in religious history as having changed
[54:53] the face of Christianity more than any
[54:56] other one man because of the serpent
[54:58] seed doctrine that that the serpency
[55:01] doctrine. If you get people who are not
[55:04] indoctrinated
[55:06] already, you talk to somebody in
[55:08] university, university students, they
[55:10] see that right away.
[55:12] you're quiet. But I'll tell you, it
[55:14] works. There's a young man by the name
[55:16] of Jonathan Larga in Croatia and uh and
[55:20] he was in university. His father died
[55:23] when he was a young man and he and
[55:25] Jonathan was going to university. You
[55:26] know him, brother pro. He's going to
[55:29] university and he's walking down the
[55:30] aisle and he heard that this other young
[55:32] lady was he wasn't married and this
[55:35] other young lady was a some kind of
[55:37] Christian. So he just walking down the
[55:39] aisle of the university and he's saying
[55:42] he said as he as he passed he said it
[55:44] wasn't an apple
[55:46] and she thought what in the world
[55:49] what what's this guy saying it wasn't
[55:51] wasn't an apple he married her she
[55:53] became his wife
[55:56] so if you need a wife you might want to
[55:58] use that
[56:01] [Applause]
[56:07] all Right. Are we doing all right for
[56:09] time?
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Now I want to I need to come now to uh
[56:27] after that first time we were with
[56:29] brother Brandham in that first hunt and
[56:31] they had asked answered those three
[56:34] questions for me. Then he said, "I'd
[56:37] like to bring my son up this fall."
[56:40] And uh and uh but in the meetings in
[56:45] Dawson Creek now, just before we had
[56:47] left
[56:49] uh to go up,
[56:51] I'm sitting on the platform. Can you let
[56:54] me just back up for just a moment? I'm
[56:57] sitting on the platform sitting over
[56:59] here. And there were about two things.
[57:02] I'm only going to take about two or
[57:04] three things. three things. Then you
[57:06] think about the two worlds.
[57:09] And I'm I'm I'm sitting beside a a very
[57:13] very dignified
[57:16] uh minister. He became a Bible school
[57:19] teacher. He was pastoring the church in
[57:21] Grand Prairie where the first meetings
[57:24] were. His name was Paul Cornish,
[57:27] Reverend Paul Cornish.
[57:29] And uh he was he was a man that was
[57:32] didn't show his emotions very much.
[57:34] So there's a whole prayer line lined up
[57:37] against the wall coming this way. That's
[57:39] the way they have them. And Paul Cornish
[57:42] is standing right beside me. He was
[57:45] quite a tall man. And brother Brandham
[57:48] has got somebody in front of him and
[57:50] he's speaking to this person in front of
[57:52] him. Now I'm going to describe just what
[57:55] happened. He's speaking to this person.
[57:57] I'm trying to listen to everything. He
[57:59] just goes like this. the boy will be all
[58:02] right.
[58:03] And then he just turns this person,
[58:05] carries right on and a force,
[58:10] a living force just flew past me. I
[58:15] didn't know. I didn't even hear exactly
[58:17] what it was. The boy will be all right.
[58:20] And this man here, you might as well hit
[58:23] him. I mean, here's a very dignified
[58:25] minister. You might as well have hit him
[58:27] with a sledgehammer. He just went like
[58:29] this, like that. And he's folded over in
[58:33] two, and he's convulsing in tears and
[58:38] sobs.
[58:40] I don't know what to do. I don't even
[58:42] know what happened. I don't even know
[58:46] what was said exactly. And here's a man,
[58:49] "Boy, I'll be all right." And here's a
[58:51] man collapsed and convulsing in tears. A
[58:55] man you couldn't get to do that for
[58:57] nothing.
[58:59] And uh and I'm I'm I'm standing not
[59:02] knowing what to do. I'm I'm I'm I'm
[59:04] stunned and uh brother Brandon carries
[59:07] on talking with this person in the
[59:09] prayer line and brother Paul Corny
[59:12] stands up erect and he touches me on the
[59:15] elbow. He says, "Brother Eddie," he
[59:18] said, "See down at the end of the line,
[59:21] not the last person, but two or three
[59:22] people up." He said, ' That's my son,
[59:26] and he's due for an operation
[59:29] next week.
[59:32] Uh, now you'll just get a few things. I
[59:36] just leave that with you. Now comes a
[59:39] woman on this side another day, a friend
[59:43] of mine, friend of my family, especially
[59:47] is much older than me,
[59:50] and she's got her hands like so.
[59:53] Her name is Sister Clint, a German
[59:56] woman. K L U N T. Sister Clint. They had
[1:00:00] no children. She was from Fort St. John.
[1:00:07] And Brother Brandham is standing and
[1:00:08] he's saying now
[1:00:11] you're praying for a man
[1:00:15] and he's shattered with death.
[1:00:18] He's not from this town.
[1:00:21] I believe he's in a place just north
[1:00:23] from here called Fort St. John.
[1:00:28] And he told her to go and just to
[1:00:31] believe. And he didn't say anything
[1:00:33] more. And she left. And I I thought,
[1:00:38] well, she's praying for this man. He's
[1:00:40] dying with cancer.
[1:00:42] And the next day, that was Saturday,
[1:00:45] Sunday, and then then this was Monday.
[1:00:49] We're leaving and Brother Vanam doesn't
[1:00:51] know where I'm taking him
[1:00:54] and we're leaving early early in the
[1:00:56] morning to go way hundreds of miles into
[1:00:59] the wilderness.
[1:01:02] And you can see that Dawson Creek here
[1:01:04] in Fort St. John are quite close
[1:01:06] together. They're about 40 miles apart.
[1:01:09] And so now on Monday morning, we're just
[1:01:12] relaxed and Brother Brandham is in his
[1:01:15] dungarees and and we're driving along.
[1:01:19] I'm sitting beside him
[1:01:21] and we start to come to Fort St. John
[1:01:24] and and the town lays to the right hand
[1:01:27] side of the highway and when the US Army
[1:01:30] pushed the road through they just went
[1:01:31] through the farmer's fields and there's
[1:01:33] an old farmhouse there
[1:01:36] and as we brother Brandham slowed down
[1:01:39] he's driving his station wagon and as he
[1:01:42] slowed down and we're coming into and
[1:01:46] there's two roads that go into into the
[1:01:48] town into the village or town of Fort
[1:01:50] St. on and the first road right after
[1:01:54] just before the first road is this big
[1:01:56] white farmhouse
[1:01:58] and we're just driving past slowly and
[1:02:01] brother Brandham just went like he said
[1:02:03] there was a woman praying for a man in
[1:02:06] Fort St. John.
[1:02:09] And I said, "That's right, Brother
[1:02:10] Brandham. That's a good friend of my
[1:02:12] family." He just went like this. He was
[1:02:14] he was in another realm. I could tell he
[1:02:16] was another realm. Now, think about two
[1:02:18] worlds. He just went like this with his
[1:02:21] hand. He put it behind my head because
[1:02:24] we were traveling. He says, "The man's
[1:02:26] in that house.
[1:02:31] You know, God is faithful. And I can
[1:02:34] tell you that Satan is not very far
[1:02:36] away.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; And a thought just flashed through my
[1:02:40] mind. Here I am with these big questions
[1:02:42] in my heart. I don't know exactly what's
[1:02:44] happening. I'm taking this man for a
[1:02:47] rest.
[1:02:48] And Satan's very, very diligent. How do
[1:02:51] you know the man's in the house?
[1:02:54] Well, I don't know. I don't know
[1:02:56] anything about the house. I don't know
[1:02:57] anything about who's there. I knew her
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; and I knew that she walked off the
[1:03:03] platform, felt uh uh felt comfortable
[1:03:08] with what brother Brandham said to her.
[1:03:10] So now we get 375 miles. Now we're way
[1:03:14] up into the wilderness, way up here.
[1:03:26] I don't know if this isn't working.
[1:03:32] We're about to here someplace.
[1:03:35] From there,
[1:03:37] the man is here. Now we're up here.
[1:03:42] And we're in Brother Southwick's house
[1:03:44] with all his little kids.
[1:03:48] And I I'm I'm anxious to make him aware
[1:03:51] what a prophet is. He doesn't know. If
[1:03:54] you said Genesis, he wouldn't know what
[1:03:56] you're talking about. If you said
[1:03:57] Revelation, he wouldn't know what you're
[1:03:59] talking about. He's just a horseman, a
[1:04:01] rancher, knew nothing about the Bible,
[1:04:03] but had received Jesus Christ as a
[1:04:05] savior. That's all he knew. So I said,
[1:04:07] "Brother Southwick, you know, Brother
[1:04:09] Bud, Brother Brandham is like a
[1:04:12] prophet." And I said, "You know, you
[1:04:14] know the Clint family." Cuz he knows
[1:04:15] them well. I said, 'Well, Sister Clunt
[1:04:18] was in the f in the in the church on the
[1:04:20] platform, and this is what Brother
[1:04:21] Brandham said to her. And I said, and as
[1:04:24] we came just past Fort St. John, I said,
[1:04:26] 'The big white house is on your right
[1:04:28] hand side there before you go in. And I
[1:04:30] I and and Brother Brandham said, "And
[1:04:33] the man's in that house." And he said,
[1:04:35] "The man isn't from here. He's in Fort
[1:04:37] St. John." As we drove past and he
[1:04:39] waved. He says, "The man's in that
[1:04:40] house." And Bud says, "Well, that's
[1:04:43] right." He says, "That's Ed Thomas. I've
[1:04:45] known him ever since I was just a boy,
[1:04:47] about eight years old. And I said, I
[1:04:49] also know that he's dying with cancer.
[1:04:52] And so here it was on the platform. Here
[1:04:54] it was that I knew her. Here it was as
[1:04:57] we drove past. Here it is 375
[1:05:01] miles into absolute wilderness.
[1:05:04] and friends, my good friends from
[1:05:07] Louisiana and Texas,
[1:05:12] I want to say something to you. You see
[1:05:15] where this is?
[1:05:17] You can go down this Rocky Mountain
[1:05:19] trench for probably 600 700 miles and I
[1:05:27] have we run out of speed. I doubt you'll
[1:05:30] ever see a human. You could go from
[1:05:33] there north probably 1,500
[1:05:38] miles and I doubt you'd ever see a
[1:05:40] human.
[1:05:42] That's wilderness.
[1:05:44] And here a man is saying, "Well, I know
[1:05:47] that he's there."
[1:05:50] And brother Brandham who's sitting there
[1:05:52] at a table is saying on the pulpit,
[1:05:55] "This man," or you might say, "Well,
[1:05:58] that's revealing the secret of the
[1:05:59] heart." That's that's that's even more
[1:06:02] than that. It was revealing the secret
[1:06:05] of her heart. But then who was that in
[1:06:07] the car?
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; And who was that for in the car? The
[1:06:11] man's in that house is my heart was
[1:06:14] smitten. These things, friends, this man
[1:06:18] here, brother Puit, senior brother
[1:06:20] pastor has asked me to give my
[1:06:22] testimony. And I'm saying it in a way
[1:06:24] perhaps I've never said it before. And
[1:06:26] now I'm saying it to you. And now you
[1:06:28] have it.
[1:06:32] those things
[1:06:34] those things this is not you know
[1:06:36] reading somebody's mind I didn't have
[1:06:38] anything in my mind other than some big
[1:06:41] fear and questions and here it's God's
[1:06:45] grace extended to us
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; and I just felt that brother Puit must
[1:06:49] feel some reason to have this lodged in
[1:06:54] somebody's heart
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; these things have never happened
[1:07:00] since Adam.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; When did this happen? Where is this in
[1:07:05] church history?
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Where is this anywhere in the world?
[1:07:08] Whoever who does this not this is not
[1:07:11] some fortune telling. This isn't reading
[1:07:14] somebody's mind. I didn't go there to
[1:07:16] have that in involved. I didn't go there
[1:07:19] I went there with fear and trembling. I
[1:07:22] went there with apprehension. I'm going
[1:07:24] to find this thing is all sideways. I I
[1:07:27] wasn't going there swallowing everything
[1:07:30] up. I was going there to it had to be in
[1:07:32] line with the scriptures.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; But then when in a few days he's saying
[1:07:38] you got three questions in your heart
[1:07:40] and the big question just evaporated.
[1:07:43] Now I saw all this anointing. And then I
[1:07:46] begin to see these people were so
[1:07:48] mightily anointed, but when the message
[1:07:50] came their way, didn't accept it. Didn't
[1:07:52] receive the word. And so there's nothing
[1:07:55] to anchor it to. And so now, Brother
[1:07:57] Southwick is saying, "I know him and I
[1:08:00] know he's dying with cancer."
[1:08:03] Not too long ago, I Googled his name,
[1:08:07] Ed Thomas in Fort St. John.
[1:08:11] In May,
[1:08:13] Sister Clint was standing there and
[1:08:15] brother Braden didn't say anything. I
[1:08:16] had noticed that. He didn't say anything
[1:08:18] about him. In July, he died from cancer.
[1:08:26] So all these years later, I hadn't paid
[1:08:29] any attention to it, but I just wanted
[1:08:31] to find out what happened to him.
[1:08:35] And uh
[1:08:37] then the last service
[1:08:39] to a Saturday night service I believe
[1:08:42] you can find it and you can hear it on
[1:08:43] the tape and it's better if you hear it
[1:08:45] on the tape and it's good that you speak
[1:08:48] English and understand and you can get
[1:08:50] the tape from Dawson Creek
[1:08:53] and and and and this is what is
[1:08:56] happening
[1:08:58] and brother Brandham is closing the
[1:09:00] service after he finished preaching.
[1:09:03] and he sang and we're singing I love
[1:09:07] him. I'm standing over here.
[1:09:10] I
[1:09:11] love him. He's leading them. I love him
[1:09:18] because he first
[1:09:21] loved me. Says, do you love him with all
[1:09:25] your heart?
[1:09:27] The people still singing
[1:09:30] just raise your hands and praise him and
[1:09:34] say thank you Jesus
[1:09:36] says what's the matter soldier boy
[1:09:40] you're not going to commit suicide
[1:09:43] that's the devil talking to you and the
[1:09:45] people are singing I love him that's the
[1:09:47] devil that's the devil lying to you boy
[1:09:50] you're only a you've only got a phobia
[1:09:54] he's lying to you he'll drive you insane
[1:09:58] if you believe him. Deny him. Renounce
[1:10:01] the devil. I command you in the name of
[1:10:03] Jesus Christ to renounce the devil and
[1:10:06] accept Jesus Christ as your healer.
[1:10:09] You'll go back and be a real gentleman
[1:10:12] and a real man. Do you do you do it?
[1:10:16] Raise up your hands to God and say,
[1:10:18] "Praise God. That's right. Oh, amen.
[1:10:22] Now, go back and be well. go back home
[1:10:25] and be well because he first loved me.
[1:10:31] And I I sat there stunned.
[1:10:41] The atmosphere was fearful
[1:10:45] and at the same time filled with
[1:10:47] question.
[1:10:50] And I knew a Canadian soldier and so I
[1:10:53] was looking for him.
[1:10:55] I had lived in US Army camps and earlier
[1:10:59] in the meetings I'd seen one out in the
[1:11:02] foyer in the lobby. I saw one just with
[1:11:05] a US tunic and he had a staff sergeant
[1:11:08] on his arm. But you know then the hippie
[1:11:11] generation was on and everybody was
[1:11:13] buying army clothes and so I didn't know
[1:11:16] whether it was just a young person
[1:11:18] wearing army clothes and he was tall.
[1:11:22] uh he was uh shallow complexion and very
[1:11:27] tight deep set eyes and I had just
[1:11:30] noticed him in the foyer and so I was
[1:11:33] looking for him now when brother
[1:11:35] Brandham called and said these words and
[1:11:39] I couldn't see any soldier
[1:11:43] at Sat on Monday morning we left very
[1:11:45] early in the morning maybe four or five
[1:11:47] o' and were driving up the highway and
[1:11:50] now we have the man's in that house and
[1:11:54] we drive on and uh we drive to Fort
[1:11:58] Nelson which is 300 miles. This is 300
[1:12:02] miles.
[1:12:11] 300 miles.
[1:12:16] Fort Nelson is just built alongside the
[1:12:19] highway. Gas stations and motel on
[1:12:23] either side and little clapboards. It's
[1:12:26] a mining like a mining town only it's a
[1:12:29] now it's become kind of an oil. They're
[1:12:31] doing oil discovery work there. And and
[1:12:34] uh there's a little clapboard hotel on
[1:12:37] this side of the road on the left. And
[1:12:40] I said, "You know, Brother Brennan, it's
[1:12:43] about noon." And and I said, "If we
[1:12:45] drive on up to South Witch, we won't get
[1:12:47] there till maybe 1:30, 2:00, and Sister
[1:12:49] Laya will be done her dishes. Maybe we
[1:12:52] should just stop and have a bite to
[1:12:54] eat." And typical Brother Benham says,
[1:12:57] "Oh, I think that's a good idea, Brother
[1:12:58] Eddie." So, he just pull off the road on
[1:13:01] a little access gravel, just gravel
[1:13:03] road, and parks the car. And we walk in
[1:13:08] uh and and and there's brother uh
[1:13:11] brother Brandham is here and brother
[1:13:13] Chrisberg is here and I'm here and we're
[1:13:16] sitting in a booth
[1:13:18] and uh just behind us is the till cash
[1:13:21] register and the door that comes in and
[1:13:26] we we there waitress came up and we
[1:13:28] ordered our dinner and nothing has come
[1:13:32] yet and the door swings open and two men
[1:13:35] walk in. Uh, one is about the size of
[1:13:40] brother John Lei and has got fair hair
[1:13:43] like him pretty much. And the other
[1:13:46] there's a young man uh quite a bit
[1:13:48] younger probably by age maybe 27 28
[1:13:54] and uh and and and those two men walk in
[1:13:57] and I recognize the one as being the one
[1:14:00] who was in the tunic
[1:14:02] and are walking the two of them walking
[1:14:04] right down looking right at us. And so I
[1:14:07] said to the one, I said, "Excuse me now,
[1:14:10] I'm sorry. Brother Brandham was here and
[1:14:12] brother
[1:14:14] uh Berg was there and I was here." And
[1:14:17] this man says,
[1:14:19] I looked up at him and we had never met.
[1:14:22] And I said, I said, "Fancy seeing you
[1:14:24] here."
[1:14:26] Cuz he was looking right at me
[1:14:27] knowingly. And uh the other shorter
[1:14:32] sandyhaired man squeezed between him and
[1:14:36] our table and thrust his hand down at
[1:14:38] brother Brandham. He says, "Brother
[1:14:40] Brandham, Brother Brandham." And brother
[1:14:42] Brandham said, "Oh," he put his hand up.
[1:14:44] He says, "Oh, oh, do I know you?" He
[1:14:46] said, "No, no, no." He said, "But you
[1:14:49] remember the soldier boy you called out,
[1:14:51] the soldier boy?" He said, "And and uh
[1:14:54] you talked to the soldier boy in the
[1:14:56] meeting." And brother Brandham has his
[1:14:58] hand up. It's still kind of shaking like
[1:15:00] this. He's, "Oh, oh, do you remember,
[1:15:02] Brother Eddie?" I said, "Yes, yes, I
[1:15:04] remember." You said, "Uh, uh, that's the
[1:15:07] devil, soldier boy. You're not going to
[1:15:10] you're not going to commit suicide.
[1:15:11] You're not going to kill yourself or
[1:15:13] that's that's the devil talking to you.
[1:15:16] Deny him. Deny him and you'll go home
[1:15:18] and be a real gentleman. Be a real man."
[1:15:21] He said, "That's it. That's right.
[1:15:23] That's what you said. That's what you
[1:15:24] said." when he says, "This is him." He
[1:15:27] said, "Would you pray for him, Brother
[1:15:29] Brandham?" And just then the waitress,
[1:15:31] she just thought that we're three guys
[1:15:33] talking or four guys or whatever we
[1:15:35] were. And she just walks in with bowls
[1:15:37] of soup and she she just slides the soup
[1:15:39] in in front of all of us and and and and
[1:15:42] uh and then she goes her way and and and
[1:15:45] brother Brandon says, "Well, yes." He
[1:15:47] said, "Well, uh oh, certainly would pray
[1:15:49] for him. Uh, I said, "Maybe we'll just
[1:15:53] eat our soup first."
[1:15:55] And I thought,
[1:16:00] "This young man's demonpossessed. He's
[1:16:02] trying to kill himself, and we're going
[1:16:04] to eat our soup first."
[1:16:07] But you know, that's what control is,
[1:16:10] friends.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; When you're in control,
[1:16:15] and I was learning things. Oh, was I in
[1:16:18] a I was in a I was in an advanced course
[1:16:22] of ministry.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; I was in an advanced course of Christian
[1:16:27] living
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; and uh and so we had our start having
[1:16:32] our soup and brother Brandon's eating
[1:16:34] his soup and I noticed he had changed
[1:16:39] and uh you know we'd been friendly and
[1:16:41] loose and you know relaxed and talking.
[1:16:44] He was always friendly, but I mean
[1:16:46] relaxed and and I can see he wasn't
[1:16:48] relaxed now. He was just eating his
[1:16:51] soup.
[1:16:53] He says, "You see, brother Eddie,"
[1:16:56] he said, "unless the Lord does
[1:16:58] something," he said, "for this young
[1:17:00] man." And I could see he was now his
[1:17:03] mind had gone to the need of this young
[1:17:05] man.
[1:17:07] And uh
[1:17:09] he said, and he's eating a soup. He says
[1:17:12] there was a woman who was blind
[1:17:16] coming through the prayer line because
[1:17:18] we had a big prayer line like you're
[1:17:20] going to have I think maybe tonight. Big
[1:17:23] prayer line coming through on Sunday.
[1:17:27] And he said she's blind.
[1:17:30] And I said I don't remember. I was one
[1:17:32] of the men praying. I said I don't
[1:17:34] remember a blind woman coming through
[1:17:36] the line. And brother Bam just said
[1:17:39] let's just see.
[1:17:41] Yes. He said, "She's blind." And brother
[1:17:43] Chris Berg said, "Yeah." He said, "I
[1:17:46] think there was a blind woman, but he's
[1:17:49] not a minister and he wasn't." So, we're
[1:17:52] just, you know, having this kind of
[1:17:53] conversation. And, uh, Brother Brandham,
[1:17:57] he just continues to eat his soup.
[1:18:00] Yes. He said, "She's blind." Oh, he
[1:18:03] said, "I understand.
[1:18:05] The y there's a younger woman that is
[1:18:08] leading her through." and the younger
[1:18:10] woman has given up her place in the
[1:18:14] prayer line to lead the blind woman
[1:18:17] through.
[1:18:19] And so I'm just listening and he looked
[1:18:22] at me. He said, "Brother Eddie, do you
[1:18:24] believe?" I said, "Yes, I do." He said,
[1:18:28] "Now, just to help you believe, I'll ask
[1:18:31] him and God will give me her name." And
[1:18:34] he just continued to eat his soup.
[1:18:37] He said, "Yes, she's a young German
[1:18:40] woman. Her name is Sister Fair." He
[1:18:43] said, "In English, we would say fear,
[1:18:46] but her in German, you'd say fair."
[1:18:49] And he said, "She has uh trouble
[1:18:53] internally." And he named five different
[1:18:55] organs
[1:18:57] that she has trouble with, he said. And
[1:19:00] then he just looked at me again, kind of
[1:19:04] shook. And now you do you believe me?
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; He just coming from another world
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; to this one just kind of made me shake
[1:19:13] his head a little said you see brother
[1:19:15] Eddie said she may be praying just now.
[1:19:20] I thought
[1:19:22] am I sitting beside a man that knows a
[1:19:26] woman someplace that's praying? I called
[1:19:29] my dad. I said, "Find out where Sister
[1:19:33] Far is that was in the meetings. She was
[1:19:37] at least 500 miles from where we were
[1:19:41] sitting."
[1:19:42] That what kind friends, message
[1:19:45] believers,
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; what kind of prophet did God send you?
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; And my father, my father located her 500
[1:19:58] miles away. Now, we got up. We finished
[1:20:01] our our meal and we got up and we went
[1:20:04] to the cash desk and brother Brandham's
[1:20:07] at the cash desk and this young soldier
[1:20:10] boy standing right behind him and he
[1:20:12] touches him on the shoulder. He said,
[1:20:14] "Brother Brandham," he said, "just two
[1:20:16] minutes. Just two minutes." "Oh, sure,"
[1:20:19] Brother Brandham said. And we stepped
[1:20:22] out and went through the door and down
[1:20:24] to this end a little wooden sidewalk. I
[1:20:27] need to describe this to you so you see
[1:20:29] what do you appreciate that
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; down little wooden sidewalk ended up at
[1:20:33] the garbage cans. Garbage cans. And the
[1:20:37] wooden sidewalk went this way where our
[1:20:39] cars were parked. And the sandyhaired
[1:20:42] man, Brother Chris Berg, and I went here
[1:20:46] to the cars. And I'm standing this way,
[1:20:48] and I'm looking right down. I want to
[1:20:50] see what Brother Brandham is doing
[1:20:52] because I'm just interested in in every
[1:20:54] aspect of the ministry. And he uh he
[1:20:58] took his little I saw how he took his
[1:21:00] little flat cowboy hat and he was
[1:21:03] holding it down here and I knew he was
[1:21:05] praying. And then uh and then uh he
[1:21:09] slipped his hat back on and they both
[1:21:12] turned around. And I have to be honest
[1:21:14] with you, I'm just a young man. There is
[1:21:16] no message. There's no message churches
[1:21:18] at the time. And and and and I'm just
[1:21:21] trying to find out what's going on. And
[1:21:23] I thought now I am not going to be swept
[1:21:27] swept into the charisma of a powerful
[1:21:30] personality. You know, it has to be
[1:21:33] absolutely real. And as they were coming
[1:21:35] back, I saw the the countenance of this
[1:21:38] young man changed completely. Totally
[1:21:41] changed. And now as he's walking with
[1:21:44] brother Brand, Brother Bran's walking
[1:21:45] really erect like that. And the young
[1:21:47] man goes like this. I'm free. I'm free.
[1:21:51] I'm free.
[1:21:53] three times.
[1:21:58] And when they came up to us, he said,
[1:22:03] "This man, when this man told me
[1:22:08] what only I and my wife in this world
[1:22:11] knows, he said, "It left me."
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; And they got in their car. I guess we
[1:22:17] took a couple of pictures because I want
[1:22:20] to say something about that. And we got
[1:22:22] in our car, they got in their car, and
[1:22:24] away we went. They had tried to catch
[1:22:27] us. This man drove this soldier boy
[1:22:31] 1,500 miles from Anchorage, Alaska to be
[1:22:36] in these meetings or Fairbanks, either
[1:22:38] one of the two. I think it was from
[1:22:39] Anchorage. And to be in these meetings
[1:22:42] and they never got them in the prayer
[1:22:43] line. And here they met him 300 miles,
[1:22:46] hundreds of miles in the absolute
[1:22:48] wilderness. and they drive their way and
[1:22:50] we drive our way.
[1:22:53] Brother Brandham says to me, "Brother
[1:22:55] Eddie, do you know this young man?" I
[1:22:58] said, "No, I don't really." He said,
[1:23:01] "Not likely you'll ever see him again."
[1:23:03] I said, "Not likely." Now, I'm going to
[1:23:07] say some things publicly I haven't said
[1:23:09] when I've told my testimony before. He
[1:23:12] said, "Not likely you'll ever see him
[1:23:13] again." I said, "Not likely." I said,
[1:23:16] 'He's way up in Fairbanks and I'm down
[1:23:20] Victoria.
[1:23:22] He said he understand if he was a friend
[1:23:24] of yours, I'd never tell you.
[1:23:27] But he said,
[1:23:29] uh, when we went to the end of the
[1:23:30] sidewalk, he said he came to us there
[1:23:34] and told him that he had a lovely
[1:23:37] Christian wife and two children. And the
[1:23:41] sandyhaired man had just told us that.
[1:23:44] Brother Chris Berg and I not not not any
[1:23:48] more than three minutes before that.
[1:23:51] He has a lovely Christian wife and two
[1:23:54] beautiful children and they don't know.
[1:23:57] He tried to commit suicide three times
[1:23:59] and they don't know what's the matter
[1:24:00] with him. And he's been under the under
[1:24:02] the direction of US Army doctors. And
[1:24:07] brother Brandham now as we're driving in
[1:24:08] the car, we haven't even hit the highway
[1:24:10] yet. And Brother Brandham says when he
[1:24:13] came to us there and told him he had a
[1:24:15] lovely Christian wife and two children,
[1:24:19] but he'd been committing homosexual acts
[1:24:22] with young men. And when he w and when
[1:24:25] that when he was told that and the enemy
[1:24:29] was exposed,
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; he was set free.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; I learned a big lesson, friends. Amen.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; You don't have to cast out every devil
[1:24:37] in the book. You have to expose him.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; And a lot of people want deliverance,
[1:24:42] but they don't want to expose him.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; You've got to expose your enemy.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; You can't come to your pastor and just
[1:24:50] say, you know, I got a problem. If you
[1:24:52] know what it is, it's a lot more than a
[1:24:54] problem. Say, expose him. Say, this is
[1:24:58] exactly what it is, and this is what I
[1:25:00] need deliverance for. And then you'll
[1:25:02] have deliverance.
[1:25:04] [Applause]
[1:25:08] Some people got some difficulty. Maybe
[1:25:09] it's lying. Maybe it's cheating. Maybe
[1:25:12] it's something else. But they don't want
[1:25:13] to say it because it's it's, you know,
[1:25:15] they're afraid of becoming too
[1:25:16] vulnerable. Expose that devil
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; tonight. Just expose him. Get rid of
[1:25:22] him. And you'll have a victory such as
[1:25:25] you've never had before. And I can tell
[1:25:27] you that that young man would have never
[1:25:29] had a deliverance if he had said if he'd
[1:25:32] said, "Well, no, I I don't want to
[1:25:33] expose it right now."
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; No. And we've experienced that in our
[1:25:38] own congregation, in our own church.
[1:25:40] We've had men come in who wanted to be
[1:25:42] delivered and tried to tried to uh veil
[1:25:47] homosexuality
[1:25:49] with leukemia. I've got cancer. I've got
[1:25:52] a leukemia. I've got a blood problem.
[1:25:55] Well, they may have had a blood problem,
[1:25:56] but that wasn't the problem. And uh and
[1:25:59] and and God revealed it to brother Tom
[1:26:02] Ray, and Tom says, "There's the phone.
[1:26:04] Uh we'll call a pastor right now. God
[1:26:07] has revealed to me that it's not
[1:26:09] leukemia. It is uh it's homosexuality,
[1:26:12] and if you if you want deliverance,
[1:26:15] we'll pick up the phone and call, and
[1:26:16] we'll have a deacon and and our brother
[1:26:18] Biscal come up here, and we'll pray for
[1:26:20] you and cast this demon out." And the
[1:26:22] man said, "I'm not ready for that."
[1:26:27] And he walked off that way.
[1:26:30] About a year and a half, two years
[1:26:32] later, I got a phone call from a
[1:26:33] hospital, a large hospital in Vancouver,
[1:26:36] and it was from the chaplain. And the
[1:26:38] chaplain was a woman,
[1:26:41] and she said, "Reverend Biscll, there's
[1:26:43] a man that's calling for you here."
[1:26:46] and uh said uh uh he'd like you to come
[1:26:51] and visit him.
[1:26:53] I said she wasn't sure what his name
[1:26:56] was. And so I said, "Well, I I don't
[1:26:59] know of anybody down there." It turned
[1:27:01] out it was the same man, the same man
[1:27:04] that had run out of the church, the very
[1:27:08] same man that God had offered him. And I
[1:27:10] finally called the chaplain back and
[1:27:12] said, "I think that this is a man that
[1:27:16] uh God offered him salvation and he
[1:27:19] refused it." And she said, "I believe
[1:27:21] you're right."
[1:27:23] And I said, "I think you should just
[1:27:25] call someone closer."
[1:27:27] So that's what
[1:27:29] And 36 years later, are you listening
[1:27:32] friends? I hope you're not too tired.
[1:27:34] 36 years later, I had a picture that was
[1:27:38] sent to me. Sent actually to my daughter
[1:27:41] Marilyn from Florida, from brother Bob
[1:27:45] Brown in Florida. And he sent that to
[1:27:48] Mike and Marilyn. And uh and uh and I
[1:27:53] was downstairs in my study and Marilyn
[1:27:56] had just dropped by the house and
[1:27:58] dropped it off. Said, "There's a
[1:27:59] picture, quite a nice 5x7 picture." And
[1:28:03] uh when I came upstairs, Sister Biscll
[1:28:06] said, "Uh, Marilyn just left this
[1:28:08] picture for you when they brought it
[1:28:10] back from Florida." And I went over and
[1:28:13] picked up the picture.
[1:28:17] And I'm looking at the picture. She
[1:28:19] said, "Well, who is it?" And I'm just
[1:28:21] looking silent. Said, "Who is it? Who
[1:28:24] who's the picture?"
[1:28:26] I said, "It's the soldier boy.
[1:28:29] It's the soldier boy.
[1:28:32] We took this picture in in in Fort
[1:28:35] Nelson. 36 years later, I'm looking at
[1:28:38] the picture. I called I called Brother
[1:28:43] Bob Brown and we don't talk together in
[1:28:47] years and I I said, "Where did you get
[1:28:50] this picture? You sent this picture up."
[1:28:53] He said, "Well, you know," he said, "I
[1:28:55] looked at the scenery and I thought it
[1:28:56] might be Canada, so I just sent it up
[1:28:58] and thought you might know something
[1:29:00] about it." I said, 'I do. It's the
[1:29:02] Soldier Boy, and this is taken in Fort
[1:29:06] Nelson, British Columbia. And and he
[1:29:09] said, 'Well, I I just sent it to you. I
[1:29:11] didn't know. I thought it might mean
[1:29:12] something to you. I said, "Where did you
[1:29:14] get this picture?" He said, "I had a
[1:29:16] young man working in my church, a young
[1:29:18] unmarried man. He was working in
[1:29:20] construction work, and they were
[1:29:23] building in a mall, doing some floor
[1:29:25] work in a mall. And uh another
[1:29:28] contractor was there and he had some men
[1:29:31] working and he said the young man from
[1:29:33] my church started to witness to him and
[1:29:35] he says well I I had my picture taken
[1:29:38] with William Brham and he said would you
[1:29:41] like me to bring you a copy and that man
[1:29:43] brought him that copy and that was the
[1:29:46] man
[1:29:49] 36 years later
[1:29:51] and I begin to realize that these things
[1:29:55] are not accidents.
[1:29:58] They don't just happen. They don't just
[1:30:00] happen. They're strange things happen to
[1:30:01] all of us. But these things all have a
[1:30:04] connection
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; from another land, from another world.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Are you all right?
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; I know you've been waiting for some of
[1:30:22] this.
[1:30:25] Uh,
[1:30:30] I got a phone call.
[1:30:34] Uh,
[1:30:36] and this was in 19 also 1961. I got a
[1:30:40] phone call and brother Brandham said,
[1:30:43] "Brother Eddie said, I believe we're
[1:30:45] going to have a good hunt this fall." I
[1:30:47] said, "Yes." Now, you I just want to
[1:30:51] answer some question. And I feel there
[1:30:52] might be some question of people's
[1:30:54] minds. Why would God do this all about
[1:30:56] hunting and all about up in the
[1:30:58] wilderness and all about the animals?
[1:31:00] You know why? There's some souls up
[1:31:03] there worth 10,000 worlds of peace.
[1:31:06] Amen.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; And when brother Bud Selfwick saw a God
[1:31:11] that understood his world, understood
[1:31:15] this wilderness, he didn't know the
[1:31:17] Bible, but he saw a Bible in action
[1:31:20] right in front of him. All about his own
[1:31:23] world. He became a believer. He was
[1:31:25] baptized. His wife became a believer.
[1:31:28] She was baptized. Some of these native
[1:31:30] Indians, they were baptized. and all of
[1:31:33] those people are worth more than all of
[1:31:35] the United States and all the world put
[1:31:37] together.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; And that's why it happened. Said, "I
[1:31:41] believe we're going to have a good
[1:31:42] hunt." He said, "I I had a vision." He
[1:31:45] said, "Or dream, whichever it was." He
[1:31:47] said, "If it's a dream, then I just ate
[1:31:49] too much pie before I went to bed." But
[1:31:51] he said, "If it was a vision, it'll come
[1:31:53] to pass exactly as it's spoken." And so
[1:31:56] he said, he said, "I saw this great
[1:31:59] animal." He said, "It's not a moose and
[1:32:01] it's not a deer and it's not an elk and
[1:32:03] I don't know what it is. I've never seen
[1:32:05] that an animal before." And the horns
[1:32:08] instead of going out on its head like an
[1:32:10] elk or like a moose, it goes back on its
[1:32:13] head like that. And I said, "Probably
[1:32:18] the only thing I know that like looks
[1:32:20] like that would be a caribou." He said,
[1:32:22] "Well, I don't know." He said, "I had
[1:32:23] never seen one." And then he says, "And
[1:32:26] then after that, uh, I I I got a a
[1:32:29] grizzly bear."
[1:32:31] Well, friends, I lived in the north. I
[1:32:36] hunted since I was 16 years old. I went
[1:32:39] out on special hunt excursions to try to
[1:32:43] get a grizzly bear. They are rare. And
[1:32:47] brother Brandham is saying he got this
[1:32:49] great mass of caribou. And right after
[1:32:52] that, he shot this grizzly bear. I
[1:32:54] thought, "Oh my goodness, that's a
[1:32:57] that's a that's more than a dream to me
[1:33:00] to see that a man get a you know, and
[1:33:02] from a hunting perspective, that's
[1:33:04] almost un unheard of." And so he said,
[1:33:07] "I was hunting with this uh uh two or
[1:33:10] three little fellows," he said. And and
[1:33:12] then anyway, he said, "I'll tell you the
[1:33:14] dream when I see you."
[1:33:16] So when we got up to Dawson Creek, I
[1:33:19] said, "Tell it to my dad, too." And my
[1:33:21] dad was there, my father. So, Brother
[1:33:24] Brandham was saying, he said, "There's
[1:33:26] two or three little fellows." And he
[1:33:28] said, "One had a checkered shirt." Well,
[1:33:30] I had had a checkered green checkered
[1:33:32] shirt, but I told my wife, "Take that
[1:33:35] shirt and throw it in the garbage and go
[1:33:38] and get me a new shirt, a red shirt. I
[1:33:40] wanted a red shirt cuz I that's the
[1:33:42] first time hunting really in the
[1:33:44] mountains and I thought I needed a red
[1:33:46] shirt. And brother Bud told me it's a
[1:33:48] good thing I didn't bring a red shirt.
[1:33:50] He'd run me out of the country because
[1:33:52] you don't wear red shirts up there. So I
[1:33:54] said, "Okay." Uh and and and I didn't
[1:33:59] know she packed my green checkered
[1:34:01] shirt. And he says and and he says there
[1:34:03] was one of the little fellas was he said
[1:34:06] what it was I got this big animal
[1:34:10] and he said and then uh uh it seemed
[1:34:13] that my my hunting buddy was down
[1:34:16] towards camp and he said it was a great
[1:34:19] panoramic area like this and he swept
[1:34:21] his hand like this. Actually, there was
[1:34:23] a mountain peak right here. But he just
[1:34:25] said he swept he swept his hand like
[1:34:26] this and camp was back this way and my
[1:34:29] my hunting buddy was down here someplace
[1:34:32] uh waiting on us. And he says, "And I
[1:34:34] got this great animal." And then on the
[1:34:37] way back, he said, "I we spotted this
[1:34:40] big silver tip grizzly." He said, "I was
[1:34:43] carrying my 270." And he called his 270
[1:34:46] Old Blondie. And he said, "I was
[1:34:49] carrying 20 270." And then he said, "All
[1:34:52] the stories you told me, Brother Eddie,
[1:34:53] about grizzly bears, and and some of
[1:34:57] them are, which would maybe be a
[1:34:59] surprise to you. A grizzly bear can
[1:35:01] overtake a fast horse in the first 100
[1:35:05] yards.
[1:35:07] That's the speed of them. And they'll
[1:35:10] run in front of the horse, turn around
[1:35:13] like that, and give it one swat like
[1:35:15] that, and break its neck.
[1:35:18] That's a grizzly bear. And you never
[1:35:21] shoot them up a mountain because a bear
[1:35:23] can come rolling like they do roll like
[1:35:25] that and when they're done rolling
[1:35:27] they're in full form
[1:35:30] and they kill a man. And brother
[1:35:32] Brandham told me they can you can shoot
[1:35:34] a grizzly bear in the heart and he can
[1:35:35] still kill a man if he's too close. And
[1:35:40] so you have to know something about
[1:35:41] grizzly bears. You don't you don't cross
[1:35:43] up with them. And brother Brandham had
[1:35:46] got this great big elk. I mean, sorry,
[1:35:48] big caribou. And I had just shot a
[1:35:51] little one. And then we spotted these
[1:35:53] two. I'm not going to give you all the
[1:35:55] details because uh uh we sat and waited
[1:35:59] until we saw Brother Brandham had got
[1:36:01] this one. And then brother Bud, just a
[1:36:04] natural natural course of events, he
[1:36:07] said, "You'll go and get your uh brother
[1:36:10] Eddie's uh meat and he'll take it down
[1:36:13] over here to a dry creek bed and uh and
[1:36:16] wait on us there and then we'll come
[1:36:17] down." On the way down, Brother
[1:36:20] Brandham, they spot this uh grizzly
[1:36:22] bear.
[1:36:24] And brother Brandham said, "Brother
[1:36:25] Eddie, I remembered all the story you
[1:36:27] told me, and I looked at my I looked at
[1:36:29] my gun, and it seemed so small, and I I
[1:36:33] fired a shot, one shot, and that bear
[1:36:37] come down that mountain." And he says,
[1:36:40] "And that one with that one shot went
[1:36:42] through the heart and killed him." And
[1:36:45] uh and I'm waiting down here and in the
[1:36:48] vision, one of the boys, one of the
[1:36:51] young fellas was supposed to be 18 years
[1:36:53] old. Brother Blaine,
[1:36:56] Brother Bud Southwick's son was way up
[1:36:58] into the Arctic on a survey crew and he
[1:37:02] and when we drove into the yard here,
[1:37:05] here Bud Blaine comes out. I said,
[1:37:08] I thought you're supposed to be up in a
[1:37:10] survey crew. He said, well, I just I
[1:37:12] just came back. I said, 'Okay.' And so
[1:37:15] Bud says he's going to come with us.
[1:37:17] Brother Brandham said in the vision that
[1:37:19] he got this grizzly bear and then when
[1:37:22] he he said then they came to this uh
[1:37:26] place and a and a man took out something
[1:37:30] to measure the horns and what it was was
[1:37:33] a little steel tape. And so brother Bud
[1:37:36] Bud took the I I I've hunted there all
[1:37:39] my life and hunted with Bud. I never
[1:37:40] seen anybody take a steel tape out to
[1:37:43] measure horns. We didn't care what size
[1:37:45] horns were, you know. We just were out
[1:37:47] for meat or whatever. But he's measuring
[1:37:49] these horns and and and and then the
[1:37:52] horn goes in a circle like this, a
[1:37:55] concave
[1:37:58] like this. And when it goes back, the
[1:38:01] bottom would flick out. So he start
[1:38:03] again.
[1:38:05] We're talking about a vision.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're talking about ministering to
[1:38:09] this soul.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; He's never seen a vision fulfilled in
[1:38:13] front of his eyes. I've never seen one
[1:38:15] like this either.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Are we there?
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; And after about three times, he says to
[1:38:27] his son, "Blaine,
[1:38:29] hold that tape in there."
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; So Blaine gets down to one leg and knee
[1:38:34] and and he holds this in there. And
[1:38:36] brother Brandham told me, he says, "I
[1:38:39] saw a young man's hands." He says, "No
[1:38:41] hair on his hands." He says, "Oh, I'd
[1:38:45] say he was about 18."
[1:38:47] And so I got Blaine off to the side
[1:38:50] before we left and he's working on a
[1:38:52] little harness. I said, "Blaine, how old
[1:38:55] are you?" He says, "18." "Why?" I said,
[1:38:58] "I just wanted to I just wanted to ask
[1:39:01] and I'm trying to put some pieces
[1:39:03] together."
[1:39:05] And then uh and so now here here
[1:39:09] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:39:09] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:39:09] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:39:09] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:39:09] brother brother Brandham uh he he's just
[1:39:11] standing here like this and I'm standing
[1:39:15] where I I want to see cuz they're going
[1:39:17] to measure the horns and blaine and and
[1:39:21] bud and I we all put our heads together
[1:39:23] where he pulls the tape over the horn
[1:39:26] and that horn fell on the black line.
[1:39:29] The end of that horn fell on the black
[1:39:31] line and Bud says it's 42 in. Yeah.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham and and I stepped
[1:39:37] back and standing there, Brother
[1:39:39] Brandham just touched me on my shoulder.
[1:39:41] He says, "There it is." And it was all
[1:39:44] over. I tell you what, friends,
[1:39:49] what kind of Where did that come from?
[1:39:51] Yeah.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; On the telephone a year about a month
[1:39:55] before, then to my father in Dawson
[1:39:58] Creek, then to Bud and his family up in
[1:40:01] their house, and now here we are. And
[1:40:04] it's unfolding exactly the same way.
[1:40:06] What happened was I was I left that
[1:40:09] morning and I was not in my checkered
[1:40:12] shirt
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; and I as far as I was concerned, my wife
[1:40:16] had been a good wife and got me a nice
[1:40:18] red one. Yeah.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; So, I was in some kind of shirt, I don't
[1:40:21] know. And we just had left camp and we
[1:40:24] had to cross a log over a fast creek and
[1:40:27] I fell in the lo I fell on the water.
[1:40:31] And I just said to the brothers, "Just
[1:40:33] wait here a second. I'll run. I'll run
[1:40:35] and get change my shirt." So, I ran back
[1:40:38] real quick and opened up my duffel bag.
[1:40:41] And here's that ugly checkered shirt.
[1:40:45] And I just thought, my wife didn't get
[1:40:48] me a new shirt. I got this one patched
[1:40:50] up again. That one had been in a vision.
[1:40:52] I had to have it on.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; So that's how I got in the checkered
[1:40:56] church.
[1:41:04] So you men that have wives that don't
[1:41:06] always do exactly what you say, they
[1:41:10] they may be in the plan of God somewhere
[1:41:12] along the line.
[1:41:18] And uh I just want to see that we have
[1:41:24] have that. Uh
[1:41:30] and then uh
[1:41:32] I had gotten a caribou myself
[1:41:37] and uh we went to get the meat and Bud
[1:41:41] said to Blaine, "You go and get, you
[1:41:44] know, Brother Eddie's meat." And so we
[1:41:48] went there, well, they went another
[1:41:49] direction. And when we went to get the
[1:41:52] meat, he had we had four horses. And one
[1:41:55] of them was a dappled grey horse. And
[1:41:59] that horse absolutely went wild at the
[1:42:02] smell of fresh blood. And that horse
[1:42:05] just gone, disappeared. Had a pack
[1:42:09] saddle on with the rope all in on top
[1:42:12] put together. And when we came back,
[1:42:15] Blaine had to tell his dad. Uh well, he
[1:42:19] said, "We lost that horse."
[1:42:21] And uh Bud says, "You know, you forgive
[1:42:25] me now. I'm going to I got I have to act
[1:42:27] and talk like that." But he kind of
[1:42:30] talked through his nose and says, "Well,
[1:42:32] you knew better and take that horse.
[1:42:34] That horse, you know, can't stand the
[1:42:36] smell of blood." And he was scolding his
[1:42:38] son. He said, "You now we've lost that
[1:42:41] horse." said, "Probably get tangled up
[1:42:44] someplace." And uh out in the willows,
[1:42:49] the wolves will get it or or starve to
[1:42:52] death. And he was sad and upset
[1:42:57] because that horse was worth several
[1:42:58] hundred dollars even back then. And
[1:43:02] mountain ponies, pack horses.
[1:43:05] And and he and he said, "Another one
[1:43:08] that'll be gone."
[1:43:11] And we're just walking out of the tent.
[1:43:13] We're back at the tent and we're just
[1:43:16] walking out there. The night doesn't
[1:43:18] come till, you know, you can read you
[1:43:21] can read your Bible in your camp at at
[1:43:24] probably 10 11:00 at night.
[1:43:27] And brother brother Bud was going out.
[1:43:30] Brother Brandham were right behind him
[1:43:31] and I was right behind him.
[1:43:34] And brother Brandham says, "I think
[1:43:36] it'll be all right, brother Bud, that
[1:43:38] you know that horse will come back." And
[1:43:40] I thought that's nice. You know, he's
[1:43:42] encouraging him. And actually what he
[1:43:45] said, and I didn't pick it all up, but
[1:43:48] he said to brother Bud, he said,
[1:43:51] "Before the sun sets over this
[1:43:53] mountain,"
[1:43:55] he said that horse will come over this
[1:43:57] null,
[1:43:58] and I have to describe this to you
[1:44:00] friends. The horse will come over this
[1:44:02] null and stop and when he sees the when
[1:44:06] he sees the tent he will winny.
[1:44:10] And so we were just outside. Brother
[1:44:13] Brandham was actually cutting wood with
[1:44:15] Blaine
[1:44:17] and I'm over here and brother Bud is
[1:44:19] over here. We're just outside of the
[1:44:22] camp and the mountains are high on both
[1:44:24] sides.
[1:44:26] Can we show that other picture?
[1:44:33] Maybe you can
[1:44:35] get it for me.
[1:44:53] Thank you. Now you see the kind of area
[1:44:56] it is.
[1:44:59] Those are mountains.
[1:45:03] You don't see any towns. There's
[1:45:04] hundreds and hundreds of square miles
[1:45:06] there. And that's just a little part of
[1:45:09] Brother Michael Dexter got it for me.
[1:45:13] There's hundreds and hundreds and
[1:45:14] hundreds of miles like that. And we're
[1:45:18] in there by horse. You have to follow
[1:45:20] the rivers all the way in. And so the
[1:45:23] sun goes behind the cloud, but the sun
[1:45:26] goes behind the mountain peaks quite
[1:45:29] early. And now I'm going to describe
[1:45:31] this to you. Brother Brandham is cutting
[1:45:33] the wood. Blaine is on this side. And
[1:45:37] brother Brandham says, "Brother Bud, if
[1:45:40] that horse is going to come, it's going
[1:45:42] to have to come pretty soon." Because
[1:45:44] the sun was just going behind that hill.
[1:45:47] And you know, he no sooner said those
[1:45:49] words. That horse came over the null
[1:45:53] and and he looked at the he and looked
[1:45:55] at the camp. His ears perked up and he
[1:45:58] gave a winnie and we brought him to the
[1:46:01] camp. Now I I have to explain something
[1:46:04] to you. You live in Texas. You've been
[1:46:07] around horses. I expect when a horse is
[1:46:10] headed home, nothing stops it. Is headed
[1:46:15] home. And this horse are eight hours
[1:46:17] from home.
[1:46:19] And we had our tent here and a mountain
[1:46:22] here and a lake here.
[1:46:24] And we had lost the horse about four
[1:46:26] miles over there. And that horse came
[1:46:29] up. Brother Brandham said it'll come up
[1:46:31] over this null. This null was on the
[1:46:34] homeward side. If a horse got past our
[1:46:38] tent, which would sound like impossible
[1:46:41] because the lake is right out there. Got
[1:46:43] past our tent. How this horse got over
[1:46:45] there, I do not know. But if he did get
[1:46:48] over there, he's gone.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; He's not going to stop till he's lthered
[1:46:53] up and home in his own corral. And that
[1:46:57] horse was past our tent on the homeward
[1:47:00] side and came up over that null. You'd
[1:47:04] say, "Well, why are you why are you
[1:47:06] raising your voice?" God had to change
[1:47:08] the nature.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; All horses run home and change the
[1:47:14] nature of that animal.
[1:47:16] and uh and come over there. And
[1:47:18] furthermore, now here, take this one.
[1:47:21] There wasn't a rope had had many feet of
[1:47:24] rope on it. The rope it was just like
[1:47:26] you just saddled him, like you just put
[1:47:28] the rope on. Nothing was disturbed on
[1:47:31] him. And and God restored the horse.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; And we had another one. I'm going to
[1:47:36] tell you this very quickly at a
[1:47:37] different time. And uh and this horse
[1:47:40] was was very very uh very mean. and they
[1:47:46] struck out with his hooves and knocked
[1:47:49] brother Southwick down, hit him on the
[1:47:51] chest with both feet. And I I I was
[1:47:55] worried. And brother Brother Southwick,
[1:47:57] he did everything in his human uh
[1:48:01] ability to get that horse to obey him
[1:48:05] and could not get him to obey. And I
[1:48:08] said, "Brother Brandham, we ought to
[1:48:10] pray." I said, "That horse trying to
[1:48:12] kill brother Southwick." And they put
[1:48:14] him up in a V and tied his head way up
[1:48:18] high like that. And that horse still
[1:48:20] struck out. And and Brother Southwick
[1:48:23] was trying to uh trying to put a a pack
[1:48:26] saddle on him. When you put the canvas
[1:48:29] on, they just go crazy. This one would
[1:48:31] go crazy. And so, Brother Southwick
[1:48:34] whipped him, which they hardly ever do,
[1:48:37] and whipped him and tried to break his
[1:48:39] his his his nature. And nothing worked.
[1:48:42] and this and even the last minute had
[1:48:45] driven him down to the ground. And
[1:48:47] that's when I said, "Brother Brennan, we
[1:48:49] we ought to pray. He's that horse is
[1:48:51] going to kill brother Southwick." And
[1:48:53] here we are 2530 miles into the
[1:48:55] wilderness. And he says, "Yeah, he's
[1:48:58] he's a nasty horse, isn't he?" And then
[1:49:01] uh I watched him and I saw if you
[1:49:05] understand horses, I saw that the flanks
[1:49:07] of the horse and his his big muscles on
[1:49:10] his rum begin to jiggle like that. And
[1:49:13] they do that when they're nervous or not
[1:49:16] so nervous, but when the fear has come
[1:49:18] on them and and and the subjection and
[1:49:21] they just began to tremble like this.
[1:49:24] And I saw brother Sulfik get them all uh
[1:49:28] reaching underneath and getting the
[1:49:31] saddle and the cinch and doing it up and
[1:49:34] the other one at the back where they
[1:49:35] don't like it and putting this pack
[1:49:37] saddle on and then finally put the tarp
[1:49:40] over top and I just Brother Brandom and
[1:49:43] I just the words were coming brother
[1:49:44] Brand and brother Brandham had his back
[1:49:47] turned like this
[1:49:49] and was just sliding his hat
[1:49:56] Are you listening to me? That horse
[1:49:59] didn't no exaggeration. That horse
[1:50:02] became a kitten.
[1:50:04] That horse we packed every day. That
[1:50:07] horse worked. That horse never even gave
[1:50:10] a twinge
[1:50:12] of being a nasty horse. That was the
[1:50:14] nicest horse you could have. And we had
[1:50:16] him out there for 10 days. And we never
[1:50:19] had one ounce of trouble with them. I
[1:50:22] said, "Friends, who did that?" The
[1:50:24] creator,
[1:50:25] [Applause]
[1:50:37] you that are horsemen,
[1:50:40] I see Brother Vanoi shaking your head.
[1:50:43] That's the way they are, aren't they?
[1:50:52] Now I feel the atmosphere is right.
[1:50:56] So I'm riding with brother Brand. I'm in
[1:50:58] the core now.
[1:51:01] And I didn't get any meat
[1:51:03] and I needed to get moose to feed us.
[1:51:08] And he and he's driving the car.
[1:51:11] And while he's driving the car, he says,
[1:51:15] "Brother Eddie," he said,
[1:51:18] "what do you think of this ministry?"
[1:51:20] And I noticed right away, he didn't say,
[1:51:22] "My ministry." He said, "This ministry."
[1:51:26] He said, "Do you think it could be that
[1:51:27] of Elijah the prophet as it's foretold
[1:51:30] in the scripture and Revelation and so
[1:51:32] on." Then I also notice those of you
[1:51:35] that listen to tapes, and I trust you
[1:51:37] all do, you'll find when brother
[1:51:40] Brandham is got people in front of him
[1:51:43] and he start to tell a person and you
[1:51:45] you come, you come here, I see you're
[1:51:48] coming from the east and you travel
[1:51:50] west. Mhm. Mhm. And you're you're doing
[1:51:54] this and he's very very deep into vision
[1:51:56] at that time. And when he says, "I'm in
[1:51:59] two worlds right now." Mhm. Mhm. That's
[1:52:02] because and if you if you see the film
[1:52:05] Deep Calls the Deep, how many have seen
[1:52:07] the film Deep Calls Deep? God bless you.
[1:52:10] You look at it again now with what I'm
[1:52:12] going to say. Brother Brandham talks to
[1:52:14] the people talking about if he if the
[1:52:16] people couldn't take God's words as far
[1:52:18] as I'm concerned that would he preaches
[1:52:20] a little bit. Then he looks back and he
[1:52:26] this lady waiting in front of him and
[1:52:28] and he kind of shakes his head like this
[1:52:32] and he says, "Is this the patient?"
[1:52:38] Is because he's not too sure which world
[1:52:40] he's in.
[1:52:43] That's what's happening. And he's
[1:52:45] shaking his head to find out. Is he 40
[1:52:48] years ago? Is he up in the future
[1:52:50] someplace? Or is it is he in real time?
[1:52:53] And is this the patient? Friends, that's
[1:52:56] never happened in any people to any
[1:52:59] country
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; since Adam.
[1:53:03] Find me a place where that happened.
[1:53:07] You have received as we heard last night
[1:53:09] and you're hearing from these ministers.
[1:53:11] This message was not born in
[1:53:14] Jeffersonville.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; This message was not born in a Bible
[1:53:19] school.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; This message came from eternity.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; What God wanted at this specific season.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; To this specific people. And I'm telling
[1:53:31] this testimony to you that you might
[1:53:33] understand we have a great a much
[1:53:37] greater responsibility. And it's not
[1:53:40] enough for us here in America to hear
[1:53:42] how good God has been to us. He has laid
[1:53:45] a huge responsibility on us. And we have
[1:53:47] that responsibility to the entire world.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; America has been the defender of freedom
[1:53:55] in the free world and a defender of
[1:53:57] democracy in the free world. But I'll
[1:53:59] tell you, it's a whole lot more than
[1:54:00] that. God has given this message to into
[1:54:04] the hands of America uh to get this
[1:54:07] message. And I believe I said something
[1:54:08] about it last time I was here. God has
[1:54:10] given it to us as a privilege and an
[1:54:14] honor for us to be able to convey it to
[1:54:16] other people.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that with all my
[1:54:19] heart
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; and I'm obsessed or possessed with that
[1:54:22] desire.
[1:54:24] you young men and you young ladies,
[1:54:27] this the greatest honor you can have?
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Do you what do you believe
[1:54:34] of this ministry? Do you think it could
[1:54:37] be that of Elijah the prophet as it's
[1:54:39] foretold in the scripture and so on?"
[1:54:41] And his voice began to trail off and get
[1:54:44] what I call thick.
[1:54:48] And I felt it I I felt it was a not
[1:54:51] unfair question, but I felt I wasn't
[1:54:53] adequate to answer that question. And I
[1:54:56] looked down at the glove box like this.
[1:54:59] And he says,
[1:55:03] I said, "Well, brother Brandham, for all
[1:55:05] I know, it must be. It has every
[1:55:08] appearance of being."
[1:55:10] And he said, put his head back a little
[1:55:13] bit. He said, "Often kind of wondered. I
[1:55:16] kind of think so myself. And at that
[1:55:19] instant,
[1:55:22] at that instant, I can't It wasn't
[1:55:25] visible with the human eye, but it was
[1:55:28] it was more than visible with the human
[1:55:29] eye. It was just like
[1:55:32] and a a being
[1:55:35] was right between us. Not right between
[1:55:37] us here, but just forward.
[1:55:41] And and I was gripped with
[1:55:45] if I breathe,
[1:55:47] if I breathe, I'm passing out of this
[1:55:50] world someplace.
[1:55:53] And I didn't know what to do. And I I
[1:55:55] looked sideways to brother Brandham.
[1:55:57] That's the only thing I knew to just to
[1:55:59] look and see what he was doing. I looked
[1:56:01] sideways to him and and his face had
[1:56:05] turned ashen. And we had several days of
[1:56:08] whiskers on. and his whiskers had
[1:56:11] prickled right out. And I understand
[1:56:13] that when a man is in a state of shock
[1:56:15] that his whiskers could prickle out and
[1:56:17] I had had one experience of that which I
[1:56:19] won't relate but a deacon friend of mine
[1:56:22] had been right to the point of death and
[1:56:24] they saved him from it but I went in to
[1:56:26] see him just immediately after and his
[1:56:29] whiskers had prickled and I thought he
[1:56:31] looks exactly like this deacon friend of
[1:56:34] mine and he looks like he's near death.
[1:56:37] And brother Brandham does this. He just
[1:56:41] puts his head back and rolls over. And
[1:56:42] then he cast his eyes sideways at me.
[1:56:47] Said, "Brother Eddie, I guess he's come
[1:56:50] to me 10,000 times." 10,000.
[1:56:53] And it's just like every time like I
[1:56:55] could die.
[1:56:57] And just then, we're just going around a
[1:57:01] slow curve. He's just driving slowly.
[1:57:03] And there's a big moose standing right
[1:57:06] in the middle of the road. And I said,
[1:57:09] "Brother Bham, there's a moose." And
[1:57:12] he's standing right broadside, probably
[1:57:14] three three 400 yards. And he just says
[1:57:18] in that slow voice, "It's all It's all
[1:57:20] right, Brother Eddie. Just get your
[1:57:22] shells and get your gun. It's all right.
[1:57:26] You You'll have him or he's yours or you
[1:57:28] know." And and he keeps driving. He
[1:57:30] doesn't slow down. I said, "Bro, Brother
[1:57:32] Brandham, now we're only about 200
[1:57:34] yards." I said, "Brother Brandham, stop
[1:57:36] and I'll just get out and I can get
[1:57:38] him." He said, "It's all right, Brother
[1:57:39] Eddie. Just have your shells and your
[1:57:41] gun." He just kept repeating the same
[1:57:42] thing. I got my shells. I got my gun.
[1:57:45] I'm ready to step out. He drives up to
[1:57:47] 90 ft.
[1:57:50] 90 ft from that animal. And I got out
[1:57:53] and the first time in my life, all my
[1:57:56] life, I pulled up my weapon and all I
[1:57:58] saw was hair.
[1:58:02] And I had to put the scope up to see
[1:58:04] where the where the backbone was and
[1:58:06] bring it down and and I pulled the
[1:58:09] trigger. And that's the only time in my
[1:58:11] life also of all the years I saw the I
[1:58:14] saw the hair just go like that. And then
[1:58:19] I was scared less he would fall right
[1:58:22] there because we're on a slight rise.
[1:58:23] Oh, I wish I could take you there. I
[1:58:25] hope this isn't too long. and and and I
[1:58:28] was afraid then instantly I'm going
[1:58:30] through such a mixture of feelings and
[1:58:32] then I was afraid he was going to come
[1:58:34] down someone come over the rise and hit
[1:58:36] him if he fell on the road and he just
[1:58:38] walks slowly off the road then it's wide
[1:58:41] clearing probably almost as wide as this
[1:58:43] building and he starts walking across
[1:58:45] that and I thought I hope he doesn't
[1:58:47] fall there because we haven't got room
[1:58:49] to take him right now and somebody will
[1:58:51] come and steal this mate and he walks
[1:58:53] across and he goes into the trees and
[1:58:56] just it goes into the trees. Blaine
[1:58:58] Southwick was with us in the back seat
[1:59:00] and he and I both fired a shot as he
[1:59:02] just walked in to the little wee pine
[1:59:04] trees about that high. He walked into
[1:59:07] the pine trees, stepped over two big
[1:59:10] windfalls, stepped over two big
[1:59:12] windfalls and fell right behind them and
[1:59:15] it was totally hidden. I thought, "This
[1:59:18] is absolutely." So we got in there and
[1:59:20] and and we we dressed the animal and
[1:59:23] brother South I mean brother Brandham
[1:59:25] sat on a log and watched us and we
[1:59:27] dressed out the animal and we went back
[1:59:29] in
[1:59:31] and now we're just doing friends what
[1:59:33] people do. You know this is our life.
[1:59:35] This is where we live. And I I got into
[1:59:38] the car and I sat down
[1:59:41] and I wish I could describe this to you
[1:59:43] and I wish you could experience it.
[1:59:47] It was like
[1:59:49] like a feeling of emerald green. It was
[1:59:52] like
[1:59:54] it was so divine. It was so peaceful.
[1:59:58] It was so wonderful. And I just sat back
[2:00:01] and I thought, I'd like to just live
[2:00:03] here forever.
[2:00:05] And brother Brandham says, "Brother
[2:00:07] Eddie, every time he comes,
[2:00:11] something good happens." Amen.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; And I pray this morning, brother P,
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; that that one
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; that came there between us,
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; that one who made this story to happen
[2:00:28] that he may be your portion tonight
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; as you come into this building. As you
[2:00:34] are coming in need to be prayed with or
[2:00:37] to hear the word of God. this one who
[2:00:40] the scripture talks about. And I'd like
[2:00:43] to can I have a just a few minutes
[2:00:45] before we go for lunch? Just a few
[2:00:48] minutes,
[2:00:50] friends.
[2:00:53] I got to I've got to say two or three
[2:00:55] things to you. Do you think that this
[2:00:58] supernatural
[2:00:59] ministry
[2:01:01] unparalleled,
[2:01:03] unequaled in human history,
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Do you think that it could happen
[2:01:09] and not be challenged?
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; This is my own.
[2:01:18] Listen close now.
[2:01:21] You can read it in the books. You can
[2:01:22] hear it on the tapes and I'll remind you
[2:01:25] of it. Brother Brandham says that demon
[2:01:28] is screaming out
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; yes
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; to this other one. It's seeking help
[2:01:33] because it it's afraid of being cast
[2:01:35] out.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Use your minds. Now, this is not this is
[2:01:39] not poetic conversation.
[2:01:41] I'm asking you to use your minds. Pinch
[2:01:43] your conscience. Do you have any idea
[2:01:46] how many demon spirits
[2:01:48] are loosed from bodies through this one
[2:01:51] man's ministry and through the bride who
[2:01:54] has received this ministry since? Do you
[2:01:57] have any idea how many demon spirits and
[2:01:59] your prophet said that the spirit does
[2:02:02] not die?
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; The person dies. And he says,
[2:02:07] furthermore, Satan takes his man, but
[2:02:10] the spirit lives on. He said, God takes
[2:02:13] his man, but the spirit lives on. Is
[2:02:16] that what he said?
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Do you have any idea how many spirits
[2:02:20] there are? and brother brother Danny
[2:02:22] Steman last night speaking of those that
[2:02:24] were around around Calvary around at the
[2:02:28] at the cross at the time of the
[2:02:30] crucifixion. I just want to perhaps go
[2:02:33] on from there just a moment just to
[2:02:36] shake your uh uh conscience a wee bit
[2:02:39] about this event that we just call
[2:02:41] Easter. It's much more than Easter.
[2:02:44] They didn't know there was an Easter.
[2:02:47] They didn't have an Easter when Jesus
[2:02:49] went to Calvary. that that that was an
[2:02:51] event that happened and the bigger event
[2:02:54] was that he was he was dying for
[2:02:57] redemption but he it was the changing of
[2:03:00] the office. Listen now it was the
[2:03:02] changing of the office. It was
[2:03:04] concluding the son of man ministry on
[2:03:07] earth at that time. He comes in three
[2:03:10] sons names. He comes as the son of man
[2:03:13] as prophet on earth. This is the
[2:03:15] unveiling of God. He comes as a son of
[2:03:18] God on the day of Pentecost. He came as
[2:03:20] a son of God. He came as a son of God
[2:03:24] and lived throughout the church ages as
[2:03:26] the son of God. Then at the end of the
[2:03:28] Leodysian church age, listen. Now he
[2:03:31] changes office once again in between the
[2:03:35] son of God and the son of David. He
[2:03:37] comes as a son of man. Again, the
[2:03:40] stories and the accounts that I've been
[2:03:42] telling you is he of the son of man. And
[2:03:45] when Jesus came now, it wasn't wasn't
[2:03:48] just a Calvary he was coming to. He was
[2:03:50] coming to a season. It was a particular
[2:03:53] season. And now the prophet said that
[2:03:56] the that the uh uh manifestation of the
[2:03:59] promise of the word of God is light. It
[2:04:04] is light. Brother Brandham says that the
[2:04:06] sun that hangs in the sky is the result.
[2:04:09] It is the spoken word of God manifested.
[2:04:12] Is that what he said? Yes.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Is that what he said?
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Now when the promise is is fulfilled, is
[2:04:19] that the sun that is the sun? It is the
[2:04:22] rising of the sun. It is the intensity.
[2:04:24] I will say that Calvary, let's not think
[2:04:26] of it as Easter now for a moment. Let's
[2:04:29] think of it. I want you to think of it
[2:04:30] as the intensity of the sun shining upon
[2:04:34] the word. The word. And here it is. That
[2:04:36] the word might be fulfilled. That the
[2:04:38] word might be fulfilled. that the
[2:04:40] promise that it might be fulfilled which
[2:04:42] was written of by the prophet and was
[2:04:44] that it might be fulfilled and brother
[2:04:46] Brandham says how many scriptures how
[2:04:48] many promises were fulfilled right in
[2:04:50] the last few hours what was it it was
[2:04:53] the intensity the intensity of the sun
[2:04:57] and he said furthermore I'm just giving
[2:04:59] it to you verbatim right now he said
[2:05:02] intensity of the sun he said the
[2:05:04] darkness the darkness is separating
[2:05:06] itself from the light and he says the
[2:05:09] light is pressing it down. He says in
[2:05:11] about 1958 and then he says in uh in
[2:05:14] shalom, I believe it is in shalom or the
[2:05:16] rising of the sun. In shalom, he said
[2:05:19] the the the the darkness is separating
[2:05:22] itself from the light. And he says God's
[2:05:26] doing it. The lights are doing it. And
[2:05:29] he says the darkness is congregating
[2:05:31] because the light is pressing it,
[2:05:33] pressing upon it. Listen friends, you
[2:05:36] have these ministers of God preaching
[2:05:38] these promises of God. Let me tell let
[2:05:40] me tell you from my own heart. I I all
[2:05:43] of this stuff if if the if the scribes
[2:05:46] and Pharisees that had internet, if
[2:05:48] they'd had Facebook, they'd have used it
[2:05:50] back then. And all I have today is the
[2:05:53] same spirits
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; hiding behind digital faces,
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; digital bodies
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; hiding because they've got they're
[2:06:03] they're the one they're operating under
[2:06:05] which is Satan. He has he has more
[2:06:08] schemes and more ways of hiding himself
[2:06:12] and and veiling himself at the same time
[2:06:15] that God is unveiling himself.
[2:06:21] And it was the intensity of the light.
[2:06:23] And furthermore, this is the harvest
[2:06:25] sun. I'm speaking fast now because we
[2:06:28] have to end. This is the harvest sun and
[2:06:31] the intensity the harvest sun. And the
[2:06:33] scripture says Jesus telling of the
[2:06:35] tears and the wheat, he said they both
[2:06:37] grow together. And when the disciples
[2:06:39] begin to say it, should we go out and
[2:06:41] tear it up? No, don't tear it up. Leave
[2:06:43] it until the end. Leave it until the
[2:06:46] harvest time. And in the harvest time,
[2:06:48] I'll send my messengers. The angels will
[2:06:51] come and divide the two and we'll gather
[2:06:54] the we'll gather the tears. Listen
[2:06:56] friends. And he said the that time is
[2:06:59] the harvest time. And the prophet of God
[2:07:02] came at this time so that the
[2:07:04] fulfillment and he says further in the
[2:07:06] unveiling of God, he said he comes again
[2:07:08] as the son of man to fulfill the rest of
[2:07:11] it. To fulfill the rest of it. Listen
[2:07:14] friends, the world cannot take this
[2:07:17] intensity
[2:07:18] of the world is not made to handle it.
[2:07:21] He even spoke, he said the message is
[2:07:23] too rich. It would make denominational
[2:07:26] people sick. It's too rich. And you
[2:07:29] you've been made with the constitution
[2:07:30] to be able to take it.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; Not just because you're a special people
[2:07:36] as an individual. You're special because
[2:07:39] God called you. You're special because
[2:07:42] God brought you into redemption.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; That's exactly why. And you want to be
[2:07:46] able to throw your shoulders back.
[2:07:48] Hallelujah. I wish I was the age of some
[2:07:51] of you young men. I tell you what, I'd
[2:07:53] cross this country. This makes me so
[2:07:55] happy to know that this is happening.
[2:07:57] And Jesus said when they were finally
[2:07:59] when the disciples saw what was
[2:08:01] happening, they couldn't understand it.
[2:08:03] And they said, "Well, uh, do do you want
[2:08:05] us to go and gather the tears?" No. He
[2:08:07] said, "Don't gather the tears. Let them
[2:08:09] both grow up together. In the end, he'll
[2:08:12] send his own messengers and gather them
[2:08:14] up. And now he comes in a in a light of
[2:08:17] fulfillment of the scripture. Fulfills
[2:08:20] the word. And every time you say the
[2:08:22] seals have been opened, I'll say the sun
[2:08:25] is shining.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; You say the word's been revealed and
[2:08:28] you've recealed the word, then then the
[2:08:31] light is shining.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; The light is shining stronger. Oh my
[2:08:35] goodness.
[2:08:37] I've had people that are sitting in our
[2:08:39] church right now and they said they said
[2:08:41] that they when they heard what we
[2:08:43] believed they thought that was too much
[2:08:45] for them. It was at the time. But we we
[2:08:49] we come for a certain person, a certain
[2:08:52] purpose. And Jesus said these words.
[2:08:55] He said these words
[2:09:00] coming to Gethsemane.
[2:09:04] Now you have a spiritual
[2:09:06] deep spiritual thinking.
[2:09:10] Peter and the apostles and Peter took
[2:09:12] out a sword. He's going to deliver him.
[2:09:15] And he strikes Malcus ear off. He wasn't
[2:09:18] aiming at his ear. He was aiming to
[2:09:19] split him straight down the middle. He
[2:09:22] had murder in his heart. He was going to
[2:09:24] kill him. You were going to do this to
[2:09:26] my Lord. Jesus said, "Pull up your put
[2:09:28] up your sword, Peter. They that live by
[2:09:30] the sword will die by the sword." Right?
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; He said, and he says, "These things must
[2:09:36] be
[2:09:37] he was giving himself to it." And the
[2:09:39] disciples couldn't believe it.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Couple of things I want to say very,
[2:09:44] very clearly. And then Jesus said these
[2:09:47] words. He said, "Why have you come out
[2:09:51] against me with swords and staves?" And
[2:09:53] it wasn't just it wasn't just Judas and
[2:09:55] a few people. The Bible says there was a
[2:09:57] multitude there.
[2:10:00] He never went out to try to talk to them
[2:10:02] again. He never tried to say, "Well, you
[2:10:03] didn't quite understand me. It's this
[2:10:05] way."
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; He let him go. Believe what you're going
[2:10:09] to believe.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus even said, "Drink up the cup of
[2:10:13] your fathers.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Fill it up. Do what you have to do."
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; You people maybe don't understand. Do
[2:10:21] you understand now where I'm at?
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Do you understand this?
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus said that. And Jesus said,
[2:10:28] "Furthermore, this is what Jesus said."
[2:10:31] And you say, "Well, he was just going to
[2:10:32] the cross." No, I say further. Wasn't
[2:10:35] just going to the cross. He was on his
[2:10:37] way to change office. This was the
[2:10:40] closing of the son of man ministry when
[2:10:43] he was on earth on that part. And he was
[2:10:46] changing. This was part of a change. The
[2:10:48] disciples didn't understand this change.
[2:10:50] And so Jesus said, "You've come out
[2:10:52] against me as a as a thief. you come out
[2:10:56] against me with staves and swords and so
[2:10:58] on. He said, "Daily I spoke with you.
[2:11:01] Daily I spoke with you in the temple."
[2:11:03] But he says, "This is your hour
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; and the power of darkness."
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; And the disciples didn't say, "Amen,
[2:11:16] Lord, we believe that."
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; They didn't know what's going to happen.
[2:11:20] This is your hour
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; and the power of darkness. And I'm
[2:11:25] saying when the a son of man
[2:11:29] revealed the same son of man
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; in this time and in this hour it might
[2:11:35] even get much more difficult. But I can
[2:11:38] tell you one thing nothing and it
[2:11:41] doesn't I'm I'm not I I don't perhaps
[2:11:44] have uh I may may not be demonstrative
[2:11:47] about it but I can tell you I have
[2:11:48] walked I have never had a question about
[2:11:51] this message. I've had lots of questions
[2:11:53] about the message. I've never had the
[2:11:55] I've never had a question about the
[2:11:58] origin of this message. Never had a
[2:12:01] question. Who Who I asked myself
[2:12:04] honestly, who can do this?
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Who can do this? Which man did this?
[2:12:10] What school did this? Where did a man
[2:12:12] learn this?
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; Come from God.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Came from the creator who said, "Let
[2:12:19] there be light."
[2:12:21] The same creator said, "This is the
[2:12:23] time. Time shall be no more. I'm going
[2:12:26] to unveil this word. It's the unveiling
[2:12:28] of God." And he describes it completely.
[2:12:31] And here we are. Here we are. Louisiana,
[2:12:34] Texas, whoever we are. Here we are to
[2:12:37] have received this word. What a glorious
[2:12:39] thing to think that you young men and
[2:12:41] young young ladies have an opportunity
[2:12:43] to take this up.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Maybe some of you haven't heard it.
[2:12:48] Maybe some of you haven't even read the
[2:12:50] rising of the sun or shalom. You need to
[2:12:52] get it. Get it right away and read it
[2:12:55] and absorb it and see what the prophet
[2:12:57] of God has said about this time. And it
[2:13:00] and and this is their hour. Their hour
[2:13:02] do whatever they say. Just do what you
[2:13:04] need to do. Get it over with. It could
[2:13:07] get a lot worse. But for us, it could
[2:13:09] only get better because
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; it took the son to bring
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; Caiaphas,
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Judas,
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; the thieves even that cast lot. You
[2:13:21] know, they cast lot for the robe of
[2:13:24] Jesus.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that it might be
[2:13:27] fulfilled. When they cast lot, the
[2:13:30] scripture came alive
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; that it might be fulfilled which was
[2:13:34] spoken. Soldiers were involved. thieves
[2:13:37] were involved. One is cursing and one is
[2:13:40] lamenting. Save yourself and save us.
[2:13:43] And the other one, the Bible says the
[2:13:45] thieves plural railed on him. But at
[2:13:47] some point in time, a thief had a
[2:13:50] revelation that perhaps we haven't got
[2:13:53] or perhaps the disciples didn't have and
[2:13:55] they didn't have it. The disciples
[2:13:57] didn't have a revelation of the kingdom.
[2:14:00] And the one thief said to Jesus, "Here
[2:14:03] he is. Do you understand what the
[2:14:05] crucifixion is? It's dying by
[2:14:07] asphyxiation. That's why they put a
[2:14:09] block under the feet and the knees are
[2:14:12] bent. The knees are bent and they're
[2:14:16] hanging and the muscles and the
[2:14:18] ligaments all pull and the diaphragm
[2:14:20] comes up and they can't breathe and from
[2:14:23] the pain and agony. Then they stiffen up
[2:14:25] like this. Straighten up so they can
[2:14:27] breathe a bit. Then they sag back down.
[2:14:29] Then they straighten up and after three
[2:14:31] days come and break the legs.
[2:14:35] So they can't straighten up anymore. And
[2:14:38] they died the death. And when they came
[2:14:39] there was not a bone of his to be
[2:14:41] broken. And they found that he his he
[2:14:44] had already given up the ghost. He had
[2:14:46] already and and and the suffering. But
[2:14:49] in between that time that thief saw
[2:14:52] something
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; and he looked over. Lord, when you come
[2:14:57] into your kingdom, remember me.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; It's not a very long prayer. He didn't
[2:15:02] see a first pull. He didn't see a second
[2:15:04] pull. He didn't see the opening of the
[2:15:06] seals. He didn't see have a whole lot of
[2:15:08] revelation. But he had one revelation
[2:15:10] that this one hanging behind him was God
[2:15:13] himself. Lord, when you come into your
[2:15:16] kingdom, remember me. And Jesus answered
[2:15:19] him, "Today you'll be with me in
[2:15:22] paradise."
[2:15:23] He didn't tell him, "I'm going to empty
[2:15:25] out paradise in a few hours."
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; He didn't tell him. He didn't try to
[2:15:30] excite him and try to get him on. Oh,
[2:15:32] we're going in the rapture. That's not
[2:15:34] why we're getting saved. We're going to
[2:15:36] escape hell. That's not why we're
[2:15:38] getting saved. We get saved cuz we see
[2:15:40] him. The Holy One of Israel.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; The Holy One that did these things and
[2:15:46] I'm seeking to give testimony to. I tell
[2:15:48] you friends, these things are true.
[2:15:51] These things are honest. These things
[2:15:53] are pure. And these things are of good
[2:15:55] report. And I leave you with them. And
[2:15:58] may God bless you. May God bless you in
[2:16:00] this hour that we're in. And and the men
[2:16:02] that have been sent here, the men that
