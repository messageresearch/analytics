[15:24] Blessed be your name, Lord Jesus.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[15:32] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[15:34] Hallelujah.
[15:36] Amen. We fall down. We lay our crowns.
[15:39] Amen. We're just going to go to prayer
[15:41] here in a moment. We have a testimony
[15:44] from the Weber family. They want to
[15:46] praise the Lord that brother Jim's in
[15:47] procedure in Portland went well. The
[15:50] doctors were amazed and Brother Jim is
[15:52] healed. Praise the Lord.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; Thank all the saints for their prayers.
[15:56] Amen. We appreciate the Lord being with
[15:58] our brother Jim Weber guiding the
[16:01] surgeon's hands. Also from our brother
[16:04] Sam Walner. He wants to thank the saints
[16:05] for their prayer prayers for Sister
[16:07] Renie. The Lord has moved on her behalf.
[16:09] We just want to keep praying for a full
[16:11] recovery.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have many requests. A number
[16:15] that are in touch and body are needed
[16:17] touch and body that are sick right now.
[16:19] Satan's on a rampage. Amen. The Holy
[16:23] Spirit's on the move.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. We're thankful.
[16:27] So, we want to remember these ones.
[16:28] There's too many to read, but our
[16:30] brother uh Frank Fletcher, Sister Hope
[16:33] Robinson, Dominic, Sister Buffy,
[16:36] all these ones are sick at home. We just
[16:38] want to pray that God would touch them
[16:39] and body our sister Luis Woods. Her
[16:41] blood pressure has been going up. She's
[16:43] not able to take the medication. She
[16:44] also needs blood work for her diabetes.
[16:47] She says, "God's will be done." I
[16:49] believe it's God's will that you be
[16:50] healed, Sister Louise. That's what the
[16:52] Bible tells us to pray for healing that
[16:55] by his stripes we are healed. So we just
[16:57] want to uplift you, Sister Luis in
[16:59] prayer. We bind our hearts with you.
[17:01] Just trust that the Lord will move on
[17:02] your behalf.
[17:04] Amen. Also, Sister Julian Israel in
[17:06] prayer for her spiritual life and she's
[17:08] up for an operation. We want to pray
[17:09] that God will move on her behalf for a
[17:11] total restoration.
[17:13] Amen. One more request for a friend of
[17:15] ours, sister Tina Dickinson's, a friend
[17:16] of hers, a close friend who's lost her
[17:18] husband. Just pray that God would move
[17:20] on behalf of this friend and use this
[17:21] time to speak to her heart. Many needs,
[17:24] there's something on your body, just
[17:25] lift it from before the Lord. First and
[17:27] foremost, we've come in worship. Amen.
[17:30] So, why don't we sing this song as we
[17:31] prepare to go to prayer? I'm going to
[17:32] ask our brother Tom if he would just
[17:34] come lay his hands on these requests. If
[17:36] there's something on your heart, just
[17:38] hold it before the Lord. Again, we bring
[17:40] the sacrifice of praise. So, let's lift
[17:42] his name. We've come here to worship
[17:44] him. We know that he's already met all
[17:45] of our needs. Amen. And so let's just
[17:47] bind our hearts together as we sing. We
[17:49] bow down, we fall down.
[17:51] Oh, and we fall down and we lay our
[17:58] ground. Oh,
[18:04] Jesus.
[18:06] Such greatness.
[18:08] [Music]
[18:12] His mercy and love.
[18:18] Oh Jesus.
[18:21] And we cry holy, holy,
[18:27] holy.
[18:29] And we cry holy, holy,
[18:35] holy.
[18:37] Yes, we cry.
[18:39] Holy, holy,
[18:43] holy
[18:45] in the lamb.
[18:50] We fall down. Oh,
[18:54] we
[18:56] fall down.
[18:58] We lay our ground
[19:08] [Music]
[19:14] mercy and
[19:19] hallelujah
[19:24] this morning
[19:27] with my Holy Lord
[19:31] you are holy
[19:34] holy
[19:35] holy
[19:37] holy
[19:39] and we
[19:41] holy holy
[19:45] holy.
[19:47] Amen. In one voice blessing we cry holy
[19:50] once more together. We cry holy Lord we
[19:56] cry holy holy
[20:00] holy
[20:04] cry holy holy
[20:08] you are holy
[20:12] holy
[20:14] holy
[20:16] holy
[20:17] [Music]
[20:24] Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Tom, bless
[20:27] you.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; We've read many requests this morning.
[20:34] Maybe there's needs that are here also
[20:35] that have not been mentioned. And we
[20:38] believe that Jesus Christ is present.
[20:40] Amen. Amen.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; We believe that he's here to meet all
[20:44] our needs according to all
[20:48] his riches and glory. So if you have a
[20:50] need this morning and you want to raise
[20:52] up your heart, raise up your hand. Let's
[20:54] bend our
[20:56] our believing together. Lord
[21:00] &gt;&gt; to believe for a supernatural
[21:03] intervention
[21:04] of the great Holy Spirit.
[21:07] [Music]
[21:13] There is only one
[21:16] that we could turn to in our hour of
[21:18] need. Father,
[21:22] man would fail us, but you have never
[21:25] failed us.
[21:28] And Father, what a comfort there is in a
[21:31] scripture where it declares when the
[21:33] enemy would come in like a flood.
[21:36] But God, you will raise a standard.
[21:41] So the enemy has come, but we will take
[21:43] thus sayaeth the Lord as our anchor this
[21:47] morning. We will rebuke Satan. We will
[21:50] stand on thus sayaeth the Lord. We will
[21:53] say the devil is a liar. God's word is
[21:56] true. We will stand here as sons and
[21:58] daughters of God that will take you at
[22:01] your word and at your promise. You said,
[22:04] "Whatsoever you desire when you pray,
[22:06] you shall have what you ask." And so,
[22:09] Lord, as I lay my hands on these
[22:11] requests, hands are raised, hearts are
[22:14] lifted up. We are believers this
[22:16] morning. We believe, thus sayaeth the
[22:18] Lord, that by your stripes,
[22:22] we are whole. And, Father God, we will
[22:25] take that promise. We will be a Caleb
[22:28] this morning. I don't care how old we
[22:30] are in the faith. We are stronger now
[22:33] than we have ever been. And so this
[22:36] morning, Lord, as brother Ryan has read
[22:38] these requests and hands were so quickly
[22:41] raised, we want to give you glory. We
[22:43] want to give you honor. We rebuke the
[22:45] devil. We resist him in Jesus' name. We
[22:49] stand as the church of the living God
[22:52] that whatsoever you bind on earth will
[22:54] be bound in heaven. We take you at your
[22:57] promise, Lord, that by your stripes
[23:01] We're whole.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; So every sickness must leave, Lord.
[23:06] Every promise in the book is mine. Every
[23:09] chapter, every verse, every line.
[23:14] And so we stand together shouldertosh
[23:16] shoulder. We are the church of the
[23:18] living God.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; We are the army of God.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; We stand now as sons and daughters
[23:24] adopted in thus sayaeth the Lord.
[23:28] And so, Father, we just pray for our
[23:30] little ones, our wives, and our
[23:32] children, those that have written in.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; We stand, Lord, on the word of God this
[23:37] morning, for it's true. Heavens and
[23:40] earth will pass away, but that word will
[23:42] never pass away. Abraham believed for 25
[23:46] years. God, we're not going to stagger
[23:48] at the promise this morning. We are not
[23:51] going to look at the symptom. We are
[23:52] going to look to the temple of the word
[23:55] of God this morning. And there will be a
[23:57] deliverance. Lord, we believe your word.
[24:01] We do not ask him this. We believe. And
[24:04] thus saith the Lord this morning.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; Every sickness we take under our control
[24:13] for the glory of God.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Father, we're not going to retreat. We
[24:21] are going to take what your prophet
[24:22] said. We're going to charge into the
[24:25] living word. this morning.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:31] [Music]
[24:32] &gt;&gt; What a promise it is. What a rejoicing
[24:34] it is.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; You bore your stripes at Calvary when
[24:39] you cried, "It's finished. It's done."
[24:44] &gt;&gt; And by your stripes, we are whole. You
[24:46] bore it for us. And we claim that
[24:48] promise this morning.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; We are not doubters. We're believers. We
[24:54] have been schooled under thus sayaith
[24:56] the word of God
[24:59] &gt;&gt; and we stand as a fortified body in
[25:02] Christ Jesus.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; So every request that was written
[25:07] &gt;&gt; we believe for the fulfillment of it.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; It's on the way.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. We might have devils
[25:14] trying to fight the answer.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; But Lord, you are the mighty conqueror
[25:20] &gt;&gt; and every devil is defeated
[25:23] &gt;&gt; and we stand
[25:26] &gt;&gt; believing.
[25:27] [Music]
[25:30] So when the man of God comes, Lord, that
[25:32] there would be an atmosphere charged
[25:34] again this morning.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; We have come to hear
[25:38] &gt;&gt; from the very throne of God that we
[25:40] could pull on the word of God, Lord.
[25:43] That God, one great day that we will so
[25:45] pull, we will get a change within the
[25:48] atoms.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; And that's what we're believing for.
[25:52] So anoint the man of God and anoint our
[25:54] ears. Anoint the remainder of the
[25:56] worship. May it be true and pure. anoint
[25:58] brother Ryan we pray
[26:01] &gt;&gt; we thank you for this time
[26:04] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name
[26:06] &gt;&gt; amen
[26:07] &gt;&gt; amen
[26:12] praise the Lord you have to have your
[26:15] seats want to say God bless you all

[26:34] the evening service tonight to go over a
[26:36] project for the Korean messages that
[26:38] need to be made ready for the hub. And
[26:40] I'm not really sure what that says, but
[26:42] many hands make light work. So, if
[26:44] you're interested in helping with the
[26:46] hub project, you can come to the project
[26:48] uh the chapel after the evening service.
[26:51] Amen. And also young people's this

[27:01] looking forward to a wonderful time.
[27:03] Amen. We're not going to delay the

[27:07] to come shortly here. Uh why don't we
[27:09] sing Oh how I love Jesus. Oh how I love
[27:12] Jesus.
[27:14] Amen. I just want to rejoice. It's been
[27:15] on my heart for weeks now. You can't
[27:19] hardly have a bad I mean, you have a bad
[27:20] day, but you know, you can't stay down
[27:22] for long. Amen. We're so thankful. Just
[27:26] yesterday, my wife and I were driving,
[27:29] and for months, I've been having some
[27:31] kind of inner ear thing that will leave
[27:33] me extremely dizzy and it will come and
[27:35] go. It won't bother me for weeks, and
[27:36] it'll just hit me out of nowhere. And
[27:38] I've had different people tell me what
[27:39] they thought it might be. Apparently,
[27:41] you can have these tiny hairs inside
[27:43] your ear that gets dislodged and it
[27:44] throws your equilibrium off. And so I'm
[27:46] dizzy and I'm driving and that's going
[27:48] through my mind and I'm thinking all the
[27:49] different causes and something just says
[27:50] demon and I'm like that's right it is.
[27:54] It's like no no it's an it's an inner
[27:55] ear imbalance. No it's a demon. And so I
[27:58] just began to say in my mind demon you
[28:00] can't touch me. It's like get off of my
[28:02] inheritance. And it was a battle for
[28:05] about half an hour but it left and has
[28:08] been back. So praise the Lord. Don't let
[28:10] Satan sit on your inheritance anymore.
[28:12] We don't want any squatters on the land.
[28:13] Amen. So, why don't we sing this? We're
[28:15] going to invite the senior choir to come
[28:17] and sing, "Still I will trust you,
[28:19] Lord." And we'll sing, "Oh, how I love
[28:21] Jesus." Amen. Oh, there is
[28:25] a name I love to hear. Oh, I love to
[28:33] sing it.
[28:38] Oh, it sounds
[28:41] like music
[28:43] in my ear. Oh, it's the sweetest
[28:49] name
[28:50] on earth and
[28:56] how I love Jes. Why? Why don't you come?
[29:01] Oh,

[29:33] Oh,
[29:35] how I love Jesus.
[29:40] Oh,

[29:52] Jesus.
[29:54] Oh,
[29:58] how love Jesus.
[30:03] How I love him.
[30:06] How I love Jesus.
[30:12] Oh.
[30:13] Oh, how I love Jesus.
[30:19] Because
[30:21] he burns
[30:24] me.
[30:25] [Music]
[30:49] [Music]
[31:03] climbed a mountain.
[31:05] [Music]
[31:08] I've walked
[31:10] a valley low.
[31:14] And there's a hand
[31:17] guiding me
[31:20] where to go.
[31:26] So I cannot question.
[31:29] [Music]
[31:32] and storm
[31:34] clouds come my way.
[31:37] For I have placed
[31:40] my trust in you
[31:44] and you alone.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Still I will trust.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; I will trust you.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Still I will follow. I will follow.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Still I
[32:05] will listen
[32:07] to your every
[32:11] calling.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Ages on. And I can't find my way.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; Still I will try. I will trust you,
[32:32] Lord,
[32:35] when in my dark hour.
[32:41] You restored
[32:44] my weary soul.
[32:47] You led me to that resting place
[32:53] and made me whole.
[32:58] So I cannot question
[33:04] those storm
[33:06] me.
[33:09] My faith is secure.
[33:12] Safe is my trust
[33:15] in you alone.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Still I will trust. I will trust you.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; Still I will follow.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; I will follow you.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Still I do
[33:38] to your every
[33:41] calling
[33:44] for the
[33:47] rages.
[33:48] [Music]
[33:49] &gt;&gt; And I can't find my way.
[33:56] Still I will trust.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; I will trust
[34:00] &gt;&gt; you.
[34:03] [Music]
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Still I
[34:09] will trust you.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Still I will find.
[34:19] Will I
[34:21] will
[34:24] to your
[34:27] calling
[34:35] &gt;&gt; and I can't find my way.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Still I will trust.
[34:46] Still I will trust you.
[34:52] Still I will trust.
[34:58] I will trust you, Lord.
[35:05] [Music]
[35:09] I will trust you, Lord.
[35:15] [Music]
[35:18] [Applause]
[35:28] I may want to send you.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Well, it's a glorious day outside.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. and glorious day inside.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:49] Uh we have so much to be thankful for.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Uh
[35:56] was thinking of the brother John Andy's
[36:00] is up ministering with brother Tim Dodd
[36:02] this morning. I was thinking maybe the
[36:05] whole family went up. I was hoping they
[36:07] didn't, but here they are. God bless
[36:09] you. Some are brother Kyle and sister
[36:12] Christina and some others are gone over
[36:14] to
[36:16] uh Vancouver Island and having a meeting
[36:19] there today. Some of the people are down
[36:21] at the camp and enjoying I suppose the
[36:24] glorious scenery there. So on one hand
[36:27] we kind of envy them, but on the other
[36:28] hand I don't envy them. They're down
[36:31] there helping brother Derek. He needed
[36:33] some help today. So uh but they're for
[36:38] sure streaming the services and uh we
[36:42] had an email this morning first thing
[36:44] one from Durban South Africa and another
[36:46] one from Israel and uh on Friday night
[36:50] about uh getting close to midnight
[36:54] between 11 and midnight got a phone call
[36:56] from brother Daniel and uh brother
[37:00] brother Dioa was in Israel he wanted to
[37:04] see if we could provide the number of
[37:06] the saints and the believers there.
[37:08] Brother Gear Rodald had just been there
[37:11] and so they were getting some ministry
[37:13] and I asked Brother Milco, please call
[37:16] Brother Daniel and let him phone brother
[37:18] Dioa and because it was going to be
[37:20] afternoon there and the arrangements all
[37:23] worked out just perfectly and brother
[37:26] Dioa got over with the believers uh
[37:29] brother brother Rodal put them in touch
[37:32] with uh I think a a Spanish-sp
[37:35] speakaking but they're Jewish people and
[37:37] a young man has become a believer about
[37:39] six years. And he brought his parents
[37:43] and uh she was in, you know, the
[37:45] traditional Jewish dress and he had the
[37:48] ke on and and but they enjoyed the
[37:51] meeting and uh and God is putting the
[37:56] little group of believers over there in
[37:59] contact with some that speak and can
[38:02] translate Hebrew.
[38:04] I tell you what, friends, God knows how
[38:06] to put things together.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; And then brother Dioa had people that
[38:11] were he said near him and that he had
[38:15] become acquainted with and they speak
[38:17] Hebrew as well. Uh so uh with with
[38:22] everything that's taking place right
[38:24] now, that whole Middle East area right
[38:28] from Morocco all the way up to Iran has
[38:33] erupted. And only God knows what the
[38:37] result of all of this is going to be.
[38:40] And I can tell you that what has
[38:42] happened in Egypt and the present regime
[38:44] that has been uh uh replaced or is being
[38:49] replaced at this time and it's in a
[38:51] state of transition.
[38:53] The people even the millions on on the
[38:55] streets and in the homes they don't know
[38:57] what the outcome is going to be. Israel
[39:00] themselves
[39:02] are
[39:04] I think apprehensive
[39:06] be and for good reason because one of
[39:08] the leading uh members of the whole
[39:13] Egyptian community is the is the Arab
[39:17] brotherhood and they have been very
[39:19] strong to voice. They are more the voice
[39:22] of the people and the people and uh the
[39:26] former President Barack
[39:28] uh uh they were uh they were not Mubarak
[39:33] I should say but they were they were not
[39:35] in keeping and for those of you that
[39:37] don't know when the Israel had that
[39:40] great victorious
[39:42] six-day war they took the entire Sinai
[39:46] Peninsula
[39:48] which is a border on them but which was
[39:50] Egypt
[39:51] And then Chiron,
[39:54] the premier of of Israel, who had a a
[39:58] brain tumor and went into a coma, and he
[40:00] still lives in a coma, but he he was
[40:05] kind of a renegade type of a general at
[40:07] that time. And he didn't when he came to
[40:10] the Suez Canal, he didn't stop. It was
[40:13] intended that he would stop rather than
[40:16] going into Egypt proper, but he didn't
[40:19] stop and he took his forces across the
[40:22] Suez Canal and encircled almost the
[40:26] entire Egyptian army and was only 90
[40:30] kilometers, I understand, from Cairo
[40:32] itself. And he being the kind of general
[40:35] he was, he was like a general patent. He
[40:38] wanted to bust it through and take and
[40:41] conquer the whole country. But even the
[40:44] the the screaming and the crying from
[40:47] the United Nations that which they had
[40:49] already been on as soon as Israel starts
[40:51] making any headway, you know, the United
[40:53] Nations cry, but as long as they're
[40:55] being crushed, they don't say a word.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; And we all know that. And we there we
[41:00] know it's a spiritual thing. And so even
[41:02] his own country had to tell him, you
[41:04] know, stop. This isn't what we intended.
[41:06] we don't want to uh you know uh defeat
[41:11] this nation but they wanted peace. So
[41:13] what they did for peace was we will we
[41:17] will give back the whole Sinai desert
[41:21] provided that it be it remains as a
[41:24] demilitarized zone
[41:26] and that is the price of peace and so
[41:30] Egypt is one of the few countries only
[41:32] two I believe Jordan and and Egypt that
[41:36] have signed a peace agreement with
[41:38] Israel but now with a new regime coming
[41:43] in or new power going to govern the
[41:45] country. Israel is quite certain that
[41:49] that peace pact will not be honored. And
[41:52] the people who are got the loudest voice
[41:54] over there right now are saying that
[41:57] very clearly that that it needs to come
[42:00] by. And I heard someone speaking,
[42:04] one of the Egyptian uh professors or
[42:07] some one and he was saying very clearly
[42:11] the peace the the the the difficulty
[42:15] does not lie within Egypt. It lies
[42:18] within Israel and Israel needs to make
[42:21] peace with the Palestinians before they
[42:24] can really have peace with us. And so
[42:26] that, you know, is the pivotal point and
[42:30] and we know that these things have to
[42:32] come. And so you don't have to wait for
[42:34] a lot of unrest over there. There's a
[42:36] lot of unrest while we're sitting here
[42:39] peacefully in the comfort of the of the
[42:42] church. But they do not have that.
[42:45] There's a great deal of apprehension
[42:48] and uh and questions within the our our
[42:53] within Israel. And you can be sure God's
[42:56] eyes is on Israel.
[42:59] Just to distract from that, this for a
[43:01] moment, I saw I I just saw a picture. It
[43:05] came up on the MSNBC
[43:07] news, which is my computer page. And uh
[43:11] and it it just had a picture of the
[43:13] universe of of uh of our our solar
[43:18] system that's from the Earth. And they
[43:21] said that there's now uh they estimate
[43:25] 50 billion planets in our in our galaxy
[43:30] in our solar system. Not the universe,
[43:34] but in our Milky Way. 50 billion
[43:37] planets. When I was in prayer this
[43:40] morning, I I thought about that. The
[43:41] picture was very impressive. I tried to
[43:43] find it. I thought I might show it to
[43:45] you, but you've all seen those kind of
[43:47] pictures. And uh I just thought, you
[43:52] know, here we are
[43:55] on this insignificant
[43:59] piece of dust
[44:01] in the whole creation.
[44:05] But but God zeroed in on it. God focused
[44:08] on it for some reason. And God and when
[44:12] God said, "Let the earth bring forth,"
[44:15] he was speaking about this place.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let the waters bring forth. He was
[44:19] talking about this place.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; And when he brought forth the creatures
[44:23] and brought forth man, he was talking
[44:25] about this place.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; And then of all the space and time that
[44:30] God
[44:32] exists in, he just he he ordained to
[44:36] come to this place.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; This is incredible.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Just imagine. And I was so moved by it
[44:43] and just so broken by it to think that
[44:46] God could even find me, find you. And he
[44:50] would be concerned. I mean, God, why are
[44:53] you concerned? Why are you interested?
[44:55] But God is even interested. And more
[44:57] than that, he's interested in how you're
[44:59] doing.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; So, how are you this morning?
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Say, we're doing fine, Father.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Have you been enjoying the
[45:09] meetings? Amen.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I am too. Well, time goes on,
[45:14] doesn't it?
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Richard Drake, he he's uh
[45:19] finding out time goes on. I think he's
[45:22] turned another year today.
[45:25] That's the way it goes. Brother Richard,
[45:28] we just can't do anything about it. And
[45:30] while some of us are getting older,
[45:31] we're having young ones come. Brother
[45:34] Andy and Sister Esther Wither. They have
[45:37] a a new one that has come and you'll
[45:40] soon see him. We're going to dedicate
[45:42] him soon and uh we're happy for that.
[45:45] Brother Andy and Sister Esther, God
[45:47] bless you. God has given them a son. So,
[45:50] uh that's wonderful and we're happy
[45:52] about that.
[45:55] Amen.
[45:57] Well, I don't want to take any more
[45:59] time, but let's have you let's stand and
[46:02] I'd like to just sing if I could but
[46:04] touch. Uh, can you give brother
[46:08] give him some volume over there?
[46:14] I could touch
[46:19] the hem of his garment.
[46:24] If I could not touch
[46:30] some part of his throne.
[46:35] I knew I'd be healed.
[46:40] My sins all forgiven.
[46:46] If I could find him, I know I'll be
[46:50] home. and lift it up once more. If I
[46:55] could but
[46:59] the
[47:01] story
[47:05] I could
[47:09] just part of.
[47:15] I know I'd be healed.
[47:21] My sins all
[47:26] if I could not touch him, I know I'd be
[47:30] healed.
[47:36] Dear heavenly father, we have your word
[47:38] laying before us and we will soon read
[47:40] words that inspired this song, inspired
[47:44] the author.
[47:46] I ask Almighty God,
[47:50] you'll come down amongst us.
[47:53] You'll sweep away all human thought and
[47:56] weakness.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; That the Holy Spirit will come in all
[48:00] his strength and beauty. revealed Jesus
[48:04] Christ to us at this moment in this
[48:06] hour, Lord. And what you would what
[48:09] would please you to see happen today. We
[48:13] say
[48:14] &gt;&gt; do it, Lord.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Do whatever is pleasing to you.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; We ask in the name of Jesus Christ that
[48:24] that name will is above every name will
[48:26] be glorified.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cleanse us of all formality.
[48:31] Oh God,
[48:33] &gt;&gt; cleanse us of all just rel religiosity.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; We want none of that. Oh God,
[48:39] &gt;&gt; come amongst us. Teach us, Lord. I give
[48:43] and surrender myself to you. Father, I
[48:46] pray that you will accomplish and
[48:48] achieve every goal that is intended for
[48:51] this moment in Jesus name. Amen.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:57] I'll have you turn in your Bibles to
[48:58] Luke the 8th chapter. And we're going to
[49:01] begin reading at the 43rd verse. And may
[49:05] I say to you that
[49:07] uh the service this morning is something
[49:10] that I've been pondering for some time.
[49:13] And just what the objective, what God
[49:16] has as an objective, I do not know. The
[49:18] first part of the message is rather
[49:22] elementary in some ways.
[49:26] And the second part we maybe get off
[49:29] into
[49:31] uh
[49:33] some scriptures that I have not put
[49:35] together the way they're coming together
[49:37] now. And so let's just pray that God
[49:41] will guide us in a supernatural way.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; I believe that it is timely and I
[49:47] believe that it's part of what God is
[49:50] doing. Amen. And incidentally, I look
[49:53] down see brother and sister Iberson,
[49:56] brother Nathaniel's mother and father.
[49:58] God bless you,
[49:59] &gt;&gt; brother Hank. Amen. God bless you. It
[50:02] was nice to see you.
[50:04] All right, we will read. And a woman
[50:06] having an issue of blood 12 years, which
[50:10] had spent all her living upon
[50:12] physicians, neither could be healed of
[50:15] any. came behind him and touched the
[50:18] border of his garment. And immediately
[50:21] her issue of blood stanced.
[50:25] Matthew in recording this said, "For she
[50:28] said within herself, if I may but touch
[50:32] his garment, I shall be whole."
[50:36] 45th verse in our reading. And Jesus
[50:40] said, "Who touched me?" When all denied,
[50:44] Peter and they that were with him said,
[50:47] Master, the multitude throng thee, and
[50:50] pressed thee, and saest thou, Who
[50:52] touched me? And Jesus said, Somebody
[50:56] hath touched me, for I perceive that
[50:59] virtue is gone out of me. And when the
[51:02] woman saw that she was not hid, she came
[51:05] trembling and falling down before him,
[51:09] she declared unto him before all the
[51:11] people, for what cause she had touched
[51:14] him, and how she was healed immediately.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; And he said unto her, Daughter, be of
[51:22] good comfort, for thy faith hath made
[51:25] thee whole. Go in peace.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[51:33] Jesus did not say my power has made you
[51:36] whole.
[51:38] Jesus did not say that uh that the that
[51:43] even the father had made her whole. He
[51:46] said your faith
[51:48] &gt;&gt; your faith
[51:50] &gt;&gt; something she already possessed.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Your faith has made you whole.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; He didn't say your faith caused you to
[51:57] touch me. Your faith made you whole.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; That was the wholesome and substance of
[52:04] it. And virtue had left from him. The
[52:07] the strength or the dynamics left him.
[52:11] The same word that says you shall
[52:13] receive power after that the Holy Spirit
[52:16] has come upon you. Exactly the same
[52:18] word. Power left him. Virtue left him.
[52:21] And brother Brandham, you hear him
[52:22] mentioning it so many times, saying that
[52:25] the the faith of the people pulling on
[52:27] him, bringing the visions is what
[52:30] weakened him. But when God was going to
[52:32] do something sovereignly, there was
[52:34] there was nothing to it. There was no
[52:36] strength that uh left him at all.
[52:39] But Jesus said that her faith, thy faith
[52:44] hath made thee whole.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was just waiting for her faith
[52:50] to uh uh to reach out and to receive
[52:56] this be this a attribute that was there.
[53:00] I want to just draw a little picture for
[53:03] a moment. The throng also touched him.
[53:07] The throng did not gather with the
[53:09] intent and the determination that she
[53:12] came for.
[53:14] She had a determination and she had said
[53:17] in her heart, "If I may but touch
[53:21] &gt;&gt; his garment, the hem of his garment."
[53:24] That's what she had said in her heart.
[53:27] Many touched him in the press, the Bible
[53:30] says, "But they were all just part of
[53:34] the press."
[53:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach to you right here.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; And all of you that are on the internet,
[53:40] I'm preaching to you. And there's
[53:42] there's people that are in need. And I'm
[53:45] preaching so that faith may be
[53:47] increased.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; We've had some glorious times, but we
[53:51] want to see we want to see the results.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't want to see the
[53:56] sick remain sick.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; We don't want to see the backslider
[54:00] remain a backslider.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; We don't want to see those that are in
[54:04] great need. We don't want to see those
[54:06] that are in financial distress to
[54:08] continue on. We want people to be able
[54:11] to lay hold of the promise of God.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; And we want a group of people that are
[54:17] that will live at the level in their
[54:20] inheritance.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; And I thank brother brother Ryan for uh
[54:26] uh his his last comments. So the throng
[54:29] that were gathered were gathered for
[54:32] different reasons. Some came because uh
[54:35] there's just there's a crowd of people
[54:36] here. They came because they were
[54:38] curious. Could be the same this morning.
[54:41] There were others that came because uh
[54:43] they they had a religious, you know,
[54:46] background and they were they were in
[54:48] wonderment about this young prophet from
[54:51] Nazareth and there's been all kinds of
[54:53] controversy about him and and some were
[54:56] there because they were against him.
[54:58] They were critical. People followed him
[55:00] to catch his words. Maybe they stream
[55:03] today to catch their words, but we don't
[55:06] care about that. Hallelujah. We're here
[55:08] to serve God. We're here to say what
[55:10] we're supposed to say. We're here to uh
[55:14] uh we're here to enjoy what God has
[55:16] given to us. But they were gathered for
[55:18] different reasons
[55:21] &gt;&gt; and they still do. Brother Brandham
[55:24] talks about the people that were able to
[55:26] touch him. He said the soldiers touched
[55:27] him when they put a a rag over his eyes
[55:31] and struck him and said who prophesy. If
[55:34] you're a prophet tell us who's tell us
[55:37] who struck you. They touched him but
[55:40] they got no virtue out of it. A lot of
[55:42] people touched him
[55:44] &gt;&gt; over the years. A lot of people touched
[55:46] him
[55:47] &gt;&gt; but didn't receive anything. But this
[55:49] woman did not come only seeking, but her
[55:53] faith told her, "If I may but touch
[55:58] &gt;&gt; the hem of his garment," what does she
[56:00] say? I will behold.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; I want you to hold that.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Because I'm going into quite a few
[56:08] things that brother Brandham has said
[56:11] that if I can touch his garment, I shall
[56:14] be whole. And she had that one thing in
[56:18] her mind. She was not concerned about,
[56:22] and I speak to you now, she was not
[56:24] concerned about who was standing beside
[56:26] her
[56:27] &gt;&gt; or you who's sitting beside her.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you that if you want
[56:32] something from God, you have to focus on
[56:35] that one thing, you have to be convinced
[56:37] in your own heart, this is for me, and
[56:40] I've come today to obtain that. Amen.
[56:43] Amen.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Not just to get enthused in the morning
[56:45] service, but that you have something
[56:47] that you're holding on to God for. And
[56:50] there comes a moment
[56:53] &gt;&gt; there comes a time
[56:54] &gt;&gt; and there comes an opportunity.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; But she wasn't concerned about who was
[56:59] standing near her
[57:01] &gt;&gt; or what her neighbor was thinking.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; She doesn't care about what her
[57:05] neighbors think. She doesn't care about
[57:06] who else is in church. She doesn't care
[57:09] about the people that were in the
[57:11] synagogue or in the temple today.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; That's not in her mind. What's in her
[57:16] mind, if I can touch his garment, I'll
[57:19] be whole.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that's in her
[57:22] mind.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; And that declared to her, it it became a
[57:25] substance to her.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; And that's why Jesus could say, "Your
[57:29] faith has made you whole."
[57:33] &gt;&gt; And you possess that.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:37] I'm going to be going through the
[57:38] message this morning and you'll find out
[57:40] the prophet of God if you believe him.
[57:42] He said you possess that,
[57:44] &gt;&gt; but it needs to be exercised.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; If you have a part of your body and you
[57:50] don't exercise it, it will atrophy
[57:53] &gt;&gt; and you'll find out that you'll have to
[57:55] start doing little small simple things
[57:58] to get your arm to work or to get your
[58:00] legs to work again if they if they lay
[58:03] idle for very long. If faith lays idle
[58:06] and Jesus spoke about weak faith.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; We don't want a weak faith, friends. We
[58:11] want an exercise faith.
[58:15] [Applause]
[58:18] &gt;&gt; That was the only thing she had in her
[58:20] mind.
[58:21] And thus she reached through a crowd
[58:25] down at the hem. She probably was
[58:29] crawling maybe between the people. And
[58:32] she was not just going to touch a man.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; She was not going to touch
[58:38] uh just Jesus of Nazareth
[58:42] because it was more than a man that was
[58:44] going to make her whole.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; So she was touching the word made flesh.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; She was touching the tree of life.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; She was touching the promises of God.
[58:59] And she probably was touching a whole
[59:01] lot more than she realized.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Now, you'll have to stay with me.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; There was another woman.
[59:14] It was our first mother, Eve.
[59:19] And when God
[59:21] spoke
[59:24] and said
[59:26] that all the trees of the garden you can
[59:29] eat and partake of.
[59:33] And uh brother Brandham said and lean
[59:36] not to your own understanding. He said,
[59:38] "Eve was easily persuaded by Satan from
[59:42] the word of God, and she leaned on her
[59:46] own understanding because Satan had
[59:48] projected something to her which wasn't
[59:51] to her real understanding of God, but
[59:54] she had something else told her by the
[59:57] enemy, Satan, and she believed it."
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Now we find the results of
[1:00:04] this. It plunged the whole human race to
[1:00:07] death
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; because the first mother, the first
[1:00:12] mother on the earth leaned to her own
[1:00:15] understanding contrary to the word of
[1:00:18] God and plunged the whole human race to
[1:00:21] death. Our first parents, Adam and Eve,
[1:00:26] had the privilege to walk, to
[1:00:29] fellowship, and commune with God in the
[1:00:33] cool of the evening. The Bible tells us,
[1:00:36] "But God had commanded Adam and Eve that
[1:00:39] they were not to eat, not to partake of
[1:00:44] the fruit." And the and and she said,
[1:00:47] "Even Eve said to the serpent, nor to
[1:00:51] touch it."
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; We are not to touch it lest we die.
[1:00:56] We're not to connect with this in any
[1:00:59] way,
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; lest we die. Amen.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; But the serpent was more subtle
[1:01:07] than any beast of the field. And subtle
[1:01:09] is not only subtility
[1:01:12] in his manner. And people have, you
[1:01:14] know, talked about the serpent, the
[1:01:16] snake, and all the rest, how subtle they
[1:01:17] are, and da da da. But it was a lot more
[1:01:22] than that. Subtle in the in the Hebrew
[1:01:25] is that he was a refined being. He was
[1:01:30] pervasive. He was he was enticing.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; But he was refined even in his perhaps
[1:01:37] his structure. And brother Brandham said
[1:01:39] he was perhaps much more handsome than
[1:01:41] even Adam.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; He had a refinement about him.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; And furthermore,
[1:01:50] as you pondered and as I did, I'm going
[1:01:52] to pass this on to you. I pondered this
[1:01:55] cunning creature.
[1:01:57] Brother Brham said, "Don't try to debate
[1:01:59] with him on the word. He knows the word
[1:02:01] better than we do.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; We're not here in a debating process.
[1:02:05] We're here just to believe what God said
[1:02:07] and leave everything else aside."
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; He was extremely cunning in his approach
[1:02:16] because he drew the one thing out of the
[1:02:20] conversation that God had with his
[1:02:22] children. He drew on the one thing that
[1:02:26] would appeal to the human psyche and
[1:02:30] that is the thing that had been
[1:02:32] forbidden.
[1:02:34] The one thing and it is you that are
[1:02:37] parents, you know that if you have
[1:02:40] something that you cannot have, that's
[1:02:43] the one thing they want. Right.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; I said to brother,
[1:02:49] "Oh, what is the family that the play
[1:02:52] and sang?"
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Cochman family.
[1:02:57] I I watch the Cochman family.
[1:03:00] One's playing the bass and one's great
[1:03:03] big guys playing the little mandolin and
[1:03:06] one's playing the violin and one's
[1:03:08] playing the guitar. And I just looked at
[1:03:09] that whole family, you know, and I
[1:03:10] thought, "How in the world did one
[1:03:12] family learn all these instruments?" So
[1:03:15] I went to brother Cochran right in a
[1:03:19] right after they played and sang an
[1:03:21] evening and I said, "How in the world
[1:03:24] did you teach these children? You know,
[1:03:27] it's enough to try and teach one, you
[1:03:29] know, uh, an instrument to be
[1:03:32] accomplished. And here they are
[1:03:33] accomplished in all these array of
[1:03:35] instruments. How did you teach them?" He
[1:03:38] said, 'Well, you know, he said, we
[1:03:40] didn't have any music in our family.
[1:03:42] None of my kids played. He said, I went
[1:03:46] downtown and I bought all these
[1:03:49] different instruments
[1:03:50] and I came home and I put them in their
[1:03:54] different rooms. And then I told them,
[1:03:56] "In your rooms are certain instruments,
[1:03:59] and don't you touch them."
[1:04:04] That was great psychology.
[1:04:07] He said, "I told them not to touch them
[1:04:09] because I knew they would. If I told
[1:04:11] them not to, they would pick them up."
[1:04:13] And he says, "That's how they learned to
[1:04:15] play." I thought, "Well, good for you.
[1:04:18] It really worked." But the the the the
[1:04:21] serpent now, and I make no comparison
[1:04:24] here, but the serpent, he had he had he
[1:04:27] was such a cunning, subtle creature. So
[1:04:30] out of everything that God had communed
[1:04:32] with them with Adam and Eve, he comes
[1:04:35] with the one thing and he says, "Uh, are
[1:04:38] can you not not eat of all the trees?"
[1:04:41] Well, all we are able to eat but this
[1:04:44] one. We're not to eat of that. And in
[1:04:47] the day we touch it, we'll die.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; So he says, "No, you won't die." And so
[1:04:53] the conversation goes on. And the woman
[1:04:56] said unto the serpent, "We may eat of
[1:04:58] the fruit of the trees of the garden,
[1:05:00] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:05:02] the midst of the garden, God hath said,
[1:05:05] Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye
[1:05:08] touch it, lest ye die." And the serpent
[1:05:11] said unto the woman, "You shall not
[1:05:13] surely die."
[1:05:16] So he says it was more subtle. He was
[1:05:19] more subtle by his approach, more subtle
[1:05:22] by the question that he asked. And as as
[1:05:25] I said earlier, the subtility is to be
[1:05:27] subtle is having fine structure. This
[1:05:30] right down to the encyclopedia
[1:05:32] bratannica. Having fine structure,
[1:05:35] delicately formed, pervasive. This is
[1:05:39] the kind of creature he was. And I
[1:05:41] thought of all the things he could have
[1:05:42] tempted her with. He went to the one
[1:05:45] thing to appeal to that part of the
[1:05:48] human,
[1:05:50] you know, the human
[1:05:53] psyche. I use the word that they it's
[1:05:57] scientifically proven people want what
[1:06:00] they're not supposed to have.
[1:06:06] They say something that's illicit
[1:06:09] is more enticing
[1:06:12] than something that you can have,
[1:06:14] something that is yours.
[1:06:17] And so that's what Satan works on. And
[1:06:20] they say they no longer had free access
[1:06:24] to the loving heavenly father
[1:06:27] who was also a holy and a righteous God.
[1:06:29] I want you to follow this close. Said,
[1:06:32] "Don't touch it." They did touch it and
[1:06:36] then were separated.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; And so now they don't even have access
[1:06:41] to God.
[1:06:44] And this is the whole plan. And the Lord
[1:06:46] God said, "Behold, the man has become as
[1:06:49] one of us to know good and evil. And
[1:06:52] now, lest watch, please, lest he put
[1:06:56] forth his hand,
[1:06:59] and take also of the tree of life and
[1:07:03] eat and live forever."
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Therefore, the Lord God sent him forth
[1:07:08] from the garden of Eden to till the
[1:07:11] ground from whence he was taken. Now, we
[1:07:14] cannot stay there because I have quite a
[1:07:17] distance to go. But they touched and
[1:07:20] took hold. And the word touch in the
[1:07:22] scripture, you're going to find this as
[1:07:25] a you're going to have to really use
[1:07:27] your mind and let your mind and
[1:07:29] imagination loose for a moment because
[1:07:31] this is as a spiritual application. to
[1:07:34] touch in the scriptures. The first one
[1:07:37] is to actually not merely lay hold of,
[1:07:41] but it's it's the it used the word
[1:07:43] kindle
[1:07:45] as in a fire.
[1:07:47] When you begin a fire, when you kindle a
[1:07:50] fire, when you touch When you touch the
[1:07:54] burning substance with a flame and it
[1:07:58] bursts into flame, you've started
[1:08:00] something that you can't really pull
[1:08:02] back. That woman, she had a fire. She
[1:08:08] had something burning within her that
[1:08:11] was greater than all of her inhibitions,
[1:08:14] greater than all of her concern about
[1:08:18] who and what. And that's powerful. A lot
[1:08:20] of people right here in this church, you
[1:08:22] I'm talking about you. I'm talking about
[1:08:23] myself. We don't do certain spiritual
[1:08:26] things that we ought to do because who's
[1:08:28] beside us? You have to have a fire
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; that becomes lit in you.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; You have to be touched by God
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; so that you no longer care who what what
[1:08:40] is said.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can't you cannot concern
[1:08:45] yourself with the way you're supposed to
[1:08:47] be or I'm I'm sedate or I'm not
[1:08:51] emotional or I'm not loud or I'm not.
[1:08:53] You don't have to be loud, but you do
[1:08:55] have to have a fire.
[1:08:58] It has to be lit.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; And it isn't lit today and out tomorrow.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; It's not a Saturday night at at at camp
[1:09:07] and then out on Monday.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; No, it's not that. It's a fire.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; And that fire can burn. It's like
[1:09:15] blazing embers. Hallelujah. And the wind
[1:09:19] of the Holy Spirit comes and they burst
[1:09:21] into another flame. That fire is the
[1:09:24] fire that witnesses. That fire is a fire
[1:09:27] that that other people feel.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; That fire is what other people is
[1:09:32] attracted to.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; It's a fire of God.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; You say amen.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; To lighten, to light, to kindle,
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; to touch.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; We'll be building on that now.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; And so God said, "Lest they put forth
[1:09:50] their hand and and get the fruit of this
[1:09:53] tree."
[1:09:54] But that woman when the tree became
[1:09:57] flesh.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; She put forth her hand
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; and took the fruit of life and she was
[1:10:05] whole. And the prophet said that's the
[1:10:08] that is the token evidence of the
[1:10:10] resurrection.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; She received a part of the resurrection
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; while all the others listen to me. There
[1:10:18] may have been people in the press
[1:10:21] jostling around that were much more sick
[1:10:24] than she was.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; There may have been cancer cases,
[1:10:28] tubercular cases, all kinds of sickness
[1:10:31] and diseases much worse than her, but
[1:10:34] they had no fire.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Nothing was lit inside.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; You don't even have to be around a whole
[1:10:43] bunch of people to have a fire.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; She didn't have anybody encouraging her.
[1:10:48] say, "Do it. Do it. Go on. This is the
[1:10:50] promise." She didn't have a bunch of
[1:10:52] encouragement. She said with her in her
[1:10:54] own self,
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Because she had a
[1:10:58] revelation, "If I may but touch his
[1:10:59] garment,
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; I'll behold."
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; And it was put here in God's eternal
[1:11:07] book
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; for you and I to read.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:14] The devil's not going to be happy with
[1:11:16] the sermon, friends.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; The devil's not going to be happy with
[1:11:20] it
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; because I'm preaching today
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; that you can obtain.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching today that you can defeat
[1:11:28] him
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; You don't have to stay
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; You don't have to stay under that thing.
[1:11:38] You don't have to stay pressed down. You
[1:11:41] don't have to stay depressed. You don't
[1:11:43] have to stay defeated. You don't have to
[1:11:45] stay sick.
[1:11:47] [Applause]
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; There have been times now God was
[1:11:58] separated from mankind and the whole
[1:12:02] program of God is to become one again
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; and he'll begin the process. Then we
[1:12:10] come to the children of Israel. One man
[1:12:13] e Abraham is receives the promise of the
[1:12:16] son and uh and Abraham is uh uh gives
[1:12:21] birth to a nation and God selects the
[1:12:24] Hebrew children. They're my children and
[1:12:26] they go into slavery and they God sends
[1:12:29] them a prophet. Let my people go and
[1:12:32] they do go and they go out into the
[1:12:34] wilderness. And then God commands Moses
[1:12:37] to come up into the mountain into Si and
[1:12:40] I'm going to talk to you there. And the
[1:12:42] fire came down on the mountain. But God
[1:12:45] said to God said to the prophet Moses,
[1:12:48] "Don't let the people come near the
[1:12:50] mountain and don't let the animals come
[1:12:53] near the mountain because this is a holy
[1:12:56] sacred moment. God is approaching trying
[1:13:00] to restore back fellowship. This is part
[1:13:03] of the plan of redemption.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; I must make my way back and find a way
[1:13:08] back. But he said, "Don't let anybody
[1:13:11] even touch the mountain.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not touchable yet.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; I'm a holy, just God.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; And if anybody touches the mountain, he
[1:13:23] will have a dart put through him and
[1:13:25] killed."
[1:13:27] The holiness required such a such a a
[1:13:31] recognition for the people to realize
[1:13:34] and it came down in the sight of all the
[1:13:36] children of Israel. And the Bible says
[1:13:39] God speaking and be ready
[1:13:42] against the third day for the third day
[1:13:45] the Lord will come down in the sight of
[1:13:47] all the people upon Mount Si.
[1:13:51] And thou shalt set bounds. You'll set a
[1:13:54] boundary. Amen.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; unto the people around about, saying,
[1:13:59] Take heed to yourselves, that you go not
[1:14:03] up into the mount,
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; or touch the border of it. Whosoever
[1:14:08] toucheth the mount shall surely be put
[1:14:11] to death.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; There shall not a hand touch it.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; You can't touch this mountain. You
[1:14:18] cannot go beyond this boundary because
[1:14:20] God was bringing his word
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; to his prophet.
[1:14:25] It's important for us to know that. But
[1:14:27] he shall surely be stoned. This is
[1:14:30] severe. This is kind of out of our realm
[1:14:33] of thinking today. But that's what God
[1:14:36] We've got to accept that's what God
[1:14:39] thought of his word. No wonder even in
[1:14:43] Israel today, those you have been there
[1:14:46] or seen pictures or documentaries or
[1:14:48] whatever and you'll see the priests,
[1:14:50] you'll see the uh rabbis and they'll and
[1:14:54] not everybody handles the scroll of the
[1:14:57] word, but they'll bring it and they hold
[1:15:00] it and they'll kiss it and they'll bring
[1:15:04] it out so delicately and roll it out and
[1:15:08] begin to read. It is. So after all of
[1:15:11] these centuries, they have never lost
[1:15:14] the holy regard for the word of God.
[1:15:18] They know nothing about the word
[1:15:19] becoming flesh.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; They know nothing about Jesus Christ as
[1:15:24] savior.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; They know nothing about him as healer.
[1:15:27] But this word is so sacred.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't think of handling the
[1:15:32] Bible the way you and I handled it. They
[1:15:34] have such a great regard for God's
[1:15:38] word,
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; even in a written form. They will not
[1:15:43] even allow a printing press to print it.
[1:15:47] They must write it by hand because they
[1:15:50] say the words of God can only be written
[1:15:53] by the work of God, by the hand of a
[1:15:56] man.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; And so those scrolls are written by hand
[1:16:01] even to this day.
[1:16:05] That's the sacredness of it.
[1:16:09] There shall not a hand touch it.
[1:16:12] There shall not a hand touch it
[1:16:16] to reach or to extend,
[1:16:18] to attain to, to obtain.
[1:16:22] A hand shall not reach through. The
[1:16:23] holiness of the word of God coming to
[1:16:26] the people was so sacred.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; That the people were not permitted to
[1:16:30] even come near or to touch it.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said on the in the the
[1:16:37] inside man, God when he settled over
[1:16:40] Mount Si that morning and Moses was up
[1:16:43] there to get the commandments,
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; he said he was in the pillar of fire.
[1:16:48] Anyone knows that God the Father,
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; anyone knows that that was as the angel
[1:16:55] of the covenant and the angel of the
[1:16:57] covenant was Jesus Christ.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; That he is in the pillar of fire.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; No one could touch him. He's holy. No
[1:17:05] one can come near him.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; He said in Abraham's grace covenant, not
[1:17:11] three gods, but three offices of the
[1:17:14] same God. God the Father in the pillar
[1:17:17] of fire.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; God the Son in human flesh.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; God the Holy Ghost in you.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; The same God. Do you believe the first
[1:17:27] part?
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; God the Father in a pillar of fire. Do
[1:17:31] you believe the second part? God the Son
[1:17:34] in Jesus Christ in the flesh. And then
[1:17:37] God the Holy Ghost. You believe this in
[1:17:40] you?
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; A lesser God. No. The same God. Yes,
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; just a piece of God. No, the same God,
[1:17:48] the same attributes, the same strength.
[1:17:51] This is what Satan hates.
[1:17:53] [Music]
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want you to realize. He
[1:17:57] doesn't want you to come to the full
[1:17:59] realization that God is present in his
[1:18:03] people.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; You do too many things.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; You'd be destructive to his kingdom.
[1:18:12] And that's what the Holy Spirit is
[1:18:15] trying to get us to.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; I say, "God, help me.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; God help you." We certainly need prayer
[1:18:22] for one another. God help us. God help
[1:18:25] this church. God help the bride of Jesus
[1:18:28] Christ to come to this place.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; I prayed for many of you this morning
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; as I thought where you sat.
[1:18:42] and what God has been doing.
[1:18:45] I prayed for you that we could come to
[1:18:48] this place.
[1:18:52] Jesus said that day you'll know that I'm
[1:18:55] in the Father and the Father in me and I
[1:18:57] in you and you in me. What day?
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; God sent a vindicated prophet to say
[1:19:03] this day.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; This day, not tomorrow. This day. Amen.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Satan is a very very cunning and
[1:19:13] faithful adversary to point out every
[1:19:16] weakness that you have and weaknesses
[1:19:18] you don't have.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; To condemn you for things that's years
[1:19:23] ago under the blood of Jesus Christ to
[1:19:25] condemn you for things that God doesn't
[1:19:27] even know about.
[1:19:32] Amen.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; He said God trying to get back to
[1:19:35] fellowship with his creature and he
[1:19:38] created in the Garden of Eden he can't
[1:19:41] disobey his own laws. Man was sinful and
[1:19:45] when he settled on Mount Si if anyone
[1:19:48] touched the mountain
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; must be thrust through with a dart. But
[1:19:52] when he was made flesh we could touch
[1:19:55] him.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Something happened
[1:20:00] remarkable when he became flesh. We
[1:20:03] could touch him.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; But now he is God the Holy Ghost in his
[1:20:10] people.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; My question to you is still can we still
[1:20:14] touch him?
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Can it be as effective?
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Can we go as far as the woman went or
[1:20:26] can we go further? Can I touch him?
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; My message is who touched me?
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham asked that
[1:20:41] many times.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Who did she touch?
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Who did he touch?
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; I'm 30 yards. I'm 40 yards.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:55] When he was made flesh, we could touch
[1:20:57] him.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; I had to hold myself back because I'm so
[1:21:02] anxious to come to some more things and
[1:21:04] I'm going to watch my time. Now, he said
[1:21:07] he becomes a part of usmen
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; to lead us and guide us and fellowship
[1:21:12] with us again.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Eden being restored again.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; But when he was made flesh, we could
[1:21:20] touch him. God has made a way, a
[1:21:23] provision whereby we can touch and make
[1:21:26] contact with God.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; When he became flesh, he said, "Come
[1:21:31] unto me
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; all ye that labor and are heavy laden,
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; and I will give you rest."
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; There was an invitation.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:46] And as they were eating at the last
[1:21:48] supper, they had the communion, what we
[1:21:50] call the communion, but they had the
[1:21:52] Passover. Many times the Bible says it
[1:21:55] was as his custom. And then Jesus said,
[1:21:58] I believe in Luke's gospel, I've desired
[1:22:01] to have this communion with you,
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; this last supper with you. Because he
[1:22:07] knew that was the last one he would have
[1:22:09] in that form.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; And they were eating. And Jesus took
[1:22:15] bread and broke it and gave it to his
[1:22:18] disciples and said, "Take, eat. This is
[1:22:21] my body. Don't just touch me, but
[1:22:25] partake of me."
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And if you would believe it,
[1:22:29] this is my body. And eat it
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; and let it come into you.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Because this is part of the truth he's
[1:22:36] trying to convey. The father's in me.
[1:22:39] I'm in the father and I'm in you
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; and you're in me. Amen.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, if we could get that, friends, if we
[1:22:47] get that, that'd change this place,
[1:22:48] change your life, and change your home
[1:22:50] forever.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; I want a special note here.
[1:23:02] You have five senses. And the five
[1:23:04] senses are a great blessing and also a
[1:23:07] great enemy.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; And you have another one. You actually
[1:23:11] possess another sense and it's called
[1:23:12] the sixth sense.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; And this sixth sense I want to say today
[1:23:17] needs to be exercised.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; The sixth sense is faith.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God cannot be touched
[1:23:24] with our five senses.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; I don't care how you felt at the camp or
[1:23:28] how you feel here. God cannot be touched
[1:23:31] with the five senses, but he can be
[1:23:33] touched with the six sense.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; You can actually touch and contact God.
[1:23:39] Amen.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Something that the that the children of
[1:23:44] Israel would have been sent stoned if
[1:23:47] they even had attempted it. And you're
[1:23:49] sitting here invited
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; with a royal invitation.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; A written invitation.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Come.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Now about these five senses.
[1:24:06] If I probably could have the lights
[1:24:08] dimmed a wee bit, please.
[1:24:12] Five senses was given to man to contact
[1:24:15] his earthly home.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; We contact God by faith, the sixth
[1:24:20] sense.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; These five senses control this body.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; But the sixth sense is faith. Amen.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; And as these are as these are read, I
[1:24:32] want you to hear the prophet's voice
[1:24:34] declaring it to you personally. And make
[1:24:37] it personal if you would please.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; And the super sense is the Holy Spirit,
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; the faith of God that dwells in you.
[1:24:47] Amen.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; And if you'll let the five senses be
[1:24:51] yielded to the sixth sense,
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; it'll guide you and bring all the other
[1:24:57] five senses under control to that super
[1:25:00] sense. And I say, "Oh God,
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; oh God,
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; let this be more than a message. Let it
[1:25:08] be more than a Sunday morning sermon.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Let us experience this. Oh God,
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; let the six sense
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; take control of my senses.
[1:25:19] [Applause]
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Be ready to let go of these.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; What can your five senses do for you?
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Very little.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; But this super sense
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; can touch the invisible God.
[1:25:43] Friends, this is not going to be an
[1:25:44] average Sunday morning service.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; God is calling on you. God is presenting
[1:25:50] it to you.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; And it's not merely my voice. I'm not
[1:25:55] just reading some words. I'm telling you
[1:25:56] what God, he spent 33 years vindicating
[1:26:00] this
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; so that you could have it.
[1:26:05] [Music]
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Don't be like the 10 spies. Be like
[1:26:10] Joshua and Caleb.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Don't look at why you can't.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Look at why you can.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; For it's so far above
[1:26:25] the natural sense as the spiritual man
[1:26:28] is above the natural.
[1:26:30] It's as far above as high as the heavens
[1:26:33] is above
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; the natural man and his five senses.
[1:26:36] Amen.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; It makes you believe things that you
[1:26:38] cannot see.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; I want you to read that line with me. It
[1:26:42] makes you believe things that you cannot
[1:26:44] see. Put your own name in there. It
[1:26:46] makes me believe things that I cannot
[1:26:49] see.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; It makes you act where you do not think
[1:26:56] the five senses would ever think about
[1:26:58] it.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; The devil can get into these five senses
[1:27:01] and lie to you. Say that over again. The
[1:27:05] devil can get into these five senses and
[1:27:07] lie to you.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; But this is one but I like. He cannot
[1:27:13] touch the super sense.
[1:27:17] Satan cannot touch the super sense. And
[1:27:20] you are a possessor of the super sense.
[1:27:25] Exercise it. Become strong in it.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Live by it.
[1:27:31] Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Live by faith.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; He cannot touch
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; that super sense
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; that's far beyond his reach.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Not just beyond his reach, it's far
[1:27:44] beyond his reach. Satan cannot touch the
[1:27:48] super sense. Put it on your fridge. Put
[1:27:51] it on your wall. Say it in the daytime.
[1:27:55] Say it at night. The Satan cannot touch
[1:27:58] the super sense. And I am a possessor of
[1:28:02] the super sense. God my father gave it
[1:28:05] to me so I can touch him.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; That come from God.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; It's called what?
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Faith.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Faith. It's called faith. This mystery
[1:28:21] of faith. The super sense is called
[1:28:24] faith.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; We walk by faith.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; We live by faith. cuz we're the children
[1:28:30] of God.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Faith is
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; that great thing.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Faith finds sources that others don't
[1:28:43] see.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Faith is the sixth sense.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Five senses are fine as long as they
[1:28:49] don't disagree with the sixth sense.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; So the five senses must agree with the
[1:28:55] sixth sense. We are to live by the sixth
[1:28:59] sense. And the five senses must be in
[1:29:02] agreement and in subjection to the sixth
[1:29:04] sense.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, uh, I don't feel it. I don't
[1:29:07] see it." Now, it's lying to the sixth
[1:29:10] sense.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; The sixth sense, it says, as it said to
[1:29:14] the woman, "If I may but touch him,
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; I will be whole."
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God will put us into places
[1:29:24] where and and we're all human.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm called to preach, but we're all
[1:29:29] human. If I hear things maybe hear
[1:29:32] things from the doctor or hear things
[1:29:34] from somebody else and it brings a
[1:29:36] sadness and you it it it it you know it
[1:29:40] just is something that you don't want to
[1:29:42] deal with and right away your mind.
[1:29:45] Hello
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; goes into a turmoil and we become
[1:29:49] tormented in our mind not because of the
[1:29:52] six sense because of the five senses of
[1:29:55] this body
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; and it brings us fear.
[1:29:59] Amen.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Brings us fear
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; and fear has torment.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; And Satan uses fear
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; to lie to you.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; You're not going to get better.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Get behind me, you liar.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Get behind me.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Start exercising that super sense.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm But I can't do it. Start
[1:30:26] exercising what little you have.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; You're not going to forget this service,
[1:30:32] friends.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Even if you want these quotes, we'll
[1:30:36] give you copies of these quotes.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; The way they are. Where were we? But the
[1:30:41] sixth sense is faith.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; It's the substance of things hoped for.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; The sixth sense is not things hoped for.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; The sixth sense is the substance of
[1:30:53] things hoped for.
[1:30:56] Yes, Lord.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; You don't see, taste, feel, smell, or
[1:31:00] hear,
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; but yet you know it.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Faith tells you so.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said to the woman, "Thy
[1:31:08] faith,
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; hath made thee whole."
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; She was already holding the substance
[1:31:14] before she touched his garment.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; And it's sure that it's real, that it
[1:31:22] comes to you a substance, not just
[1:31:25] imagination, but it's something. It's
[1:31:28] something you have.
[1:31:30] [Music]
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; You have it.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; You have it by virtue of a sense that
[1:31:35] you have.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; I know I could reach my hand out. I have
[1:31:41] faith in my arm. I know that I could
[1:31:43] touch this. And when I touch it, I know
[1:31:46] that it'll be hard cuz my eyes tell me
[1:31:48] it's wood. And I can I I know how it'll
[1:31:51] feel. So I reach out and right away I
[1:31:54] have a sensation. I have a feeling. It's
[1:31:57] strong. It's sturdy. It's solid. If I if
[1:32:00] I can slap it and I, you know, I have a
[1:32:03] certain reaction. If I bang my elbow on
[1:32:05] it, I I I it may hurt. I know that
[1:32:09] because my senses are telling me all of
[1:32:11] that. But faith goes beyond that.
[1:32:14] Faith is something you don't see
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; and you don't hear it.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; And you don't feel it.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; You feel rotten.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; You feel sick.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; But the promise of God says, "Ask what
[1:32:27] you will
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; and it shall be done."
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; That is more than an excitement.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; That is more than hope.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; It is a reality.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; I said to my wife sitting at around the
[1:32:54] table and we said quite a number of
[1:32:57] times, we just get in the car, sit
[1:33:00] around the table. I say I I just feel so
[1:33:04] privileged. God has given us both such
[1:33:06] wonderful health.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Such wonderful health.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; I go to the doctor. I go to the doctor
[1:33:12] frequently. My wife goes whenever we
[1:33:15] need to go. We go to the doctor. But I
[1:33:18] have a doctor
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; that tells that doctor what to do.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; I have a doctor that tells him what to
[1:33:24] do.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; I have a doctor that baffles this doctor
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; says, "Well, you got this. Take another
[1:33:32] test." No, we can't find it. Good.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; I'm happy for both. I'm happy when he
[1:33:38] says you got it. I'm happy when he says
[1:33:41] it's gone.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; God, to God be the glory.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Sometimes he has to lay you in with
[1:33:48] sickness so you can look up.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Sometimes he has to set you aside
[1:33:52] because you got too busy
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; and you have to find out that the all
[1:33:56] the busyiness isn't important,
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; that there's something else that's more
[1:34:00] important.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Am I making some headway?
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Where are we at? Faith finds sources
[1:34:14] that others don't see. Faith is the
[1:34:16] sixth sense. Five senses are fine as
[1:34:19] long as they don't disagree with the
[1:34:21] sixth. But the sixth sense is faith.
[1:34:24] It's the substance of things hoped for.
[1:34:26] You don't see, taste, feel, smell, or
[1:34:29] hear, but you know, but you know it.
[1:34:32] Faith tells you so. And it's so sure
[1:34:35] that it's real, that it comes to you a
[1:34:38] substance, not just an imagination. It's
[1:34:42] something that you have.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing. I'm going to
[1:34:52] just just take that off for a moment,
[1:34:55] please.
[1:34:57] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:35:00] the word of God. Well, we've heard that
[1:35:01] so many times. And brother Brandham says
[1:35:04] that now he's in a meeting. He said he's
[1:35:06] here.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; You can't see him.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; You couldn't feel him.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham couldn't see anything
[1:35:14] more than you can see.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; He knew by his call
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; and he knew by the presence of God.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; If you feel and sense a certain
[1:35:25] presence, don't just say, "Well, this is
[1:35:28] blessing." Say, "He's here."
[1:35:31] That's what you need to say. He's here.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; He may be there to bless. He may be
[1:35:36] there to do a lot of other things, but
[1:35:38] he's here.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; That's what God wants you to say.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; He wants you to say that in your home.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; He is here.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; The sacrifice is here.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is here.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm saying it because I believe I
[1:36:01] feel I need to say it in this sanctuary.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; We got to go beyond
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; even being just blessed. Got to go
[1:36:08] beyond
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; an an altar call. Got to go beyond what
[1:36:13] we've done where we've been before.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; We have to make some confessions. And
[1:36:18] maybe you haven't said that enough
[1:36:20] times. And brother Brandon says, "How
[1:36:22] how long should you say it?" You say it
[1:36:24] till you believe it.
[1:36:26] till you actually believe it.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; He is here.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; He is in me.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; I have become one with God.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Whoa.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; You'll have to do that to go forward in
[1:36:40] the rest of this service.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; What I have to say, he said, and the
[1:36:44] angel of the Lord, he said, he is here.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; And he said, now pray. That's important.
[1:36:50] Pray.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. The angel turned his back to the
[1:36:54] audience. Talking about the angel who
[1:36:56] came to Abraham, he turned his back to
[1:36:59] the audience.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says, "Somebody in these
[1:37:03] sections over here." So he turned his
[1:37:05] back. Somebody in these sections over
[1:37:07] here, he said in this section over here,
[1:37:11] you pray
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; and God that for God to do something for
[1:37:16] you and just see if he will still remain
[1:37:20] the same angel of God or somebody
[1:37:24] anywhere, wherever it is. He said, "Now,
[1:37:27] now he's still got his back turned and
[1:37:29] he says now somebody is contacting God."
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. How could he say that? Because he
[1:37:38] is feeling
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; he is feeling that pull.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; And God sent this kind of a visitation
[1:37:44] so he could bring a special message to
[1:37:46] us.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; This God didn't depart when William
[1:37:49] Brandham departed.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; This God didn't depart. This God moved
[1:37:53] on to even do greater things.
[1:37:59] [Applause]
[1:37:59] [Music]
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Greater things.
[1:38:04] When brother Brandon was here,
[1:38:07] his crowds had diminished
[1:38:10] to a few hundred from hundreds of
[1:38:12] thousands. What would he have done? What
[1:38:15] would he have? What kind of message
[1:38:17] would he have brought us? So he said,
[1:38:19] "Man,
[1:38:20] everybody left me."
[1:38:24] But instead, he preached the seals. He
[1:38:27] knew he was sent back. He knew it was a
[1:38:29] commission. And he said, "10,000 of my
[1:38:33] friends will leave me now."
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Did that stop him? No, that didn't stop
[1:38:39] him. He was moving forward on his call.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly where you are. That's
[1:38:45] where I am. That's where we are. We're
[1:38:48] called to be the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; My objective, your objective is the
[1:38:54] marriage table.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; We're on our way to the marriage table.
[1:38:58] Say it. believe it.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; I'm on the way to the marriage table.
[1:39:03] [Applause]
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't want you to say that.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; My feeling doesn't tell me that. My
[1:39:10] feeling tells me I'm getting to be an
[1:39:12] old man. But my faith is, oh God, I'm
[1:39:15] looking for the resurrection. I'm
[1:39:17] looking for the rapture.
[1:39:19] [Music]
[1:39:20] [Applause]
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; That's my sixth sense. Amen.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; And if I pass this world without having
[1:39:27] experienced it, that six sense will take
[1:39:30] me out of the grave.
[1:39:34] [Music]
[1:39:36] [Applause]
[1:39:39] [Music]
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; You
[1:39:51] You know me and you understand me. I
[1:39:53] wouldn't say anything to hurt anyone,
[1:39:55] but uh one of our native young men, when
[1:39:59] I say ours, he was a son of a woman
[1:40:03] who's up in White Horse now, but this
[1:40:06] young man died and died a under rather
[1:40:11] strange conditions in a prison and they
[1:40:14] asked me to come and take the funeral.
[1:40:18] So there was, you know, his girlfriend
[1:40:20] and her friends and other friends and
[1:40:22] they came there with their drums
[1:40:25] and their sticks
[1:40:28] and they wanted to have part of the
[1:40:29] service to be up and beat their drums
[1:40:33] and go through religious ceremony. And I
[1:40:35] said, "No."
[1:40:38] The people said, "Do you mind that?" I
[1:40:39] said, "Yes, I don't I wouldn't have
[1:40:41] that."
[1:40:43] So they were kind of disappointed
[1:40:45] and sat there. But I preached what God
[1:40:47] had put on my heart. But when we got and
[1:40:50] we were putting him down in the in the
[1:40:53] in the ground in a casket, they brought
[1:40:56] their drums and I they wanted to beat
[1:40:57] their drums. And I stepped over to them
[1:41:00] and I said, "No,
[1:41:02] I don't I don't want you to feel bad.
[1:41:07] You have to know who you are.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; You have to know that you have something
[1:41:12] more." And I said to them, about three
[1:41:15] of them, I said, "Listen, please don't
[1:41:18] feel bad."
[1:41:20] I said, "Your drums won't bring him out
[1:41:23] of the grave. What I have to say will
[1:41:26] bring him out of the grave.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; What I have to say, what he's believed
[1:41:31] in and what his mother prayed and
[1:41:32] believed for him will bring him out of
[1:41:34] the grave. But your drums won't breed
[1:41:36] him out of the grave." I'll tell you
[1:41:38] what, friends. church church annity just
[1:41:41] having a nice little service even around
[1:41:43] the message that won't bring you out of
[1:41:45] the grave. That won't put you in the
[1:41:46] rapture. I'm concerned about what's
[1:41:49] happening in the message. God is
[1:41:50] stirring me very very deeply from things
[1:41:53] that I've seen and we cannot just be
[1:41:55] another church.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; We got to be something far beyond that.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; God gave us too much. God brought us too
[1:42:03] much.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He gave us a word to live
[1:42:07] by.
[1:42:08] And this is the same supernatural God.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; And don't you ever give up. That's one
[1:42:17] thing. Faith will not Faith will not
[1:42:19] give up.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:34] Amen.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody's contacting God.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; And I believe
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; without any question, without a shadow
[1:42:43] of a doubt,
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; these meetings that we've had, people
[1:42:47] can say, I don't want to even refer to
[1:42:48] it as winter camp. It's just some more
[1:42:51] meetings, just another minister.
[1:42:53] Incidentally, this next Friday night
[1:42:55] will be brother Oedoka. He's going to
[1:42:58] come and speak to the young people. And
[1:43:01] as many people as want to come there, it
[1:43:03] doesn't make any difference to me. You
[1:43:04] adults want to come be in the fellowship
[1:43:06] room. I'll be there, Lord willing,
[1:43:08] Friday night.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; And God has been using our brother Rich
[1:43:13] uh brother Richard, his father Oed. And
[1:43:17] so we're looking forward to that.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Now somebody's contacting God.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; I stood I didn't feel any great emotion.
[1:43:28] They talk about Saturday night the C. I
[1:43:30] didn't feel any emotion. I was happy. I
[1:43:33] was just happy to see what God was
[1:43:34] doing. I didn't feel one thing.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Not one thing. I went up to the cabin. I
[1:43:41] listened floating over through the air
[1:43:44] praying and the rejoicing and going on
[1:43:46] and on and on. That that's wonderful. I
[1:43:49] don't feel anything spectacular, but I
[1:43:53] just I am rejoicing because I know it's
[1:43:55] God's word.
[1:43:58] I know that this is what you're supposed
[1:43:59] to receive.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; When you were here the other the other
[1:44:06] day, you brothers and praying.
[1:44:11] I played it again last night late in
[1:44:14] middle of the night.
[1:44:16] Brother Joel and
[1:44:21] brother Ben and the other boys that were
[1:44:23] around.
[1:44:26] I was rejoicing,
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; but I didn't feel any great excitement
[1:44:30] because this is what's supposed to
[1:44:32] happen.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; This is almighty God.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Mother and dad have prayed
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; and they've believed and we shouldn't be
[1:44:40] shocked when people are healed.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be shocked when they're
[1:44:43] made whole. We shouldn't be shocked when
[1:44:46] we touch the hem of his garment. We
[1:44:48] don't understand it. It's another sense.
[1:44:50] It's a sick sense. But I'm here to tell
[1:44:53] you it works.
[1:44:56] It works.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; And God's not done working.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; And you're going to hear more preaching
[1:45:09] like this.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Cuz God's raising up an army. There'll
[1:45:13] be preachers out there. And you're going
[1:45:16] to hear more witnessing
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; because there's a power, a surge coming
[1:45:22] within the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:45:26] Brother Brandham even said, "You
[1:45:28] sisters, you're going to lay hands on."
[1:45:30] He said it.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; You can lay hands on somebody.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; God will hear your prayer.
[1:45:36] [Music]
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; You mothers can lay hands on your
[1:45:40] children. You don't even have to call
[1:45:41] the preacher. You lay your hands on
[1:45:43] them. I know who I am.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil tell you you haven't
[1:45:53] got a right. You have a right.
[1:45:56] [Applause]
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; He says in another message in Phoenix,
[1:46:04] I'm going to turn my back to you.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; While you pray,
[1:46:09] while you pray. Notice how he said that
[1:46:11] while you pray. We need to be a praying
[1:46:14] people.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Stay in an attitude of prayer.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; You can be busy and praying. You can be
[1:46:20] working and praying. You can be in your
[1:46:23] studies, in your classroom, and be in an
[1:46:25] atmosphere of prayer.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; I'm going to turn my back while you
[1:46:33] pray. I'm going to talk to brother
[1:46:35] Duplac. brother. He turned his back
[1:46:37] because brother Duplac was sitting there
[1:46:38] and a brother uh uh a brother Mccanley
[1:46:44] he says and sitting back here he says I
[1:46:47] want to to you as ministers I no he's
[1:46:50] trying to tell the ministers trying to
[1:46:52] teach the ministry he says and and I
[1:46:54] want to just say right now to you
[1:46:57] ministers I want to say right now you
[1:46:59] watch
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; you can't tell me that this prophet
[1:47:05] didn't have confidence in what he had.
[1:47:09] [Music]
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; And he's trying to tell you, you have
[1:47:13] the same thing. Not by the same call,
[1:47:16] but the same quality,
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; the same person.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; You can say he's here like he said he's
[1:47:24] here.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; You can say I'm healed like he said
[1:47:28] you're healed.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:35] He says, "Now watch. Somebody is in this
[1:47:39] audience is coming in contact with the
[1:47:43] Holy Spirit behind me. Somebody's coming
[1:47:47] in contact." I will say without being
[1:47:50] brazen, somebody is coming in contact
[1:47:52] with the Holy Spirit that's out here
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; that's in front of me.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because you're listening to
[1:48:01] the word and you're believing it.
[1:48:05] A vindicated prophet told you, you don't
[1:48:08] need brother Ed Biscll to tell you a
[1:48:09] vindicate. I'm simply studying what he
[1:48:12] said.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you under the uncction
[1:48:15] of the Holy Spirit. This is the only
[1:48:17] vindicated message the world has.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; 2 million Muslims don't have it. A
[1:48:24] million Catholics don't have it. All the
[1:48:27] denominations don't have it. The bride
[1:48:29] of Jesus Christ has a vindicated
[1:48:32] message.
[1:48:34] God vindicated it. He He went the second
[1:48:37] mile so you would believe it
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; so that you'd confess it
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; and say it's mine.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; And no one can take it from me.
[1:48:59] He went on to say, "I feel in my own
[1:49:02] makeup
[1:49:04] that the Holy Spirit,
[1:49:07] the Holy Spirit,
[1:49:09] somebody is touching him."
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I I
[1:49:16] Please understand me. I am intrigued
[1:49:21] and somewhat mystified,
[1:49:24] but I realize that it's got to go beyond
[1:49:26] my own mental capacity. That's right.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; I want to know something about this
[1:49:31] touching him.
[1:49:36] And he asked, there's a woman sitting in
[1:49:39] this direction right here over here that
[1:49:42] just contacted the Holy Spirit.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; That service is no different than this
[1:49:47] service.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Someone just contacted the Holy Spirit
[1:49:53] and she's suffering with a heart trouble
[1:49:54] and sitting right down there. She's
[1:49:58] having trouble taking salt in her food.
[1:50:02] And you believe with all your heart,
[1:50:03] lady, stand up.
[1:50:06] That's true.
[1:50:08] And it's all over now.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; You can go home. Be well.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Tell me." He's asked the
[1:50:17] congregation, he asked the preacher,
[1:50:18] "Tell me, who did she touch?"
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; What did she touch?
[1:50:27] Now faith I said earlier faith needs to
[1:50:29] be exercised. Can I go on a few minutes
[1:50:31] please?
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Faith needs to be exercised.
[1:50:36] He said somebody said all things are
[1:50:39] possible with God. Nothing impossible.
[1:50:44] Uh but all things are possible to you
[1:50:46] also.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Nothing impossible to them that believe.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; All things are possible brought right
[1:50:53] down and made you. If you just know who
[1:50:56] God is,
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid that the church doesn't know
[1:51:00] their authority. I'm afraid that the
[1:51:02] Holy Ghostborn men don't realize their
[1:51:05] authority or the authority that God has
[1:51:08] permitted to his church. Here's a
[1:51:10] vindicated prophet. I'm afraid this was
[1:51:13] one of his apprehensions that the church
[1:51:16] doesn't know their authority. Oh God,
[1:51:19] let this church, let these people, let
[1:51:22] the bride of Jesus Christ come to know
[1:51:25] their authority.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; You may not have the power, but you have
[1:51:30] the authority.
[1:51:32] [Applause]
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid that Holy Ghostborn men, I'm
[1:51:38] one of those, and I don't want to be
[1:51:40] that one that doesn't realize their
[1:51:42] authority or the authority that God has
[1:51:45] permitted to his church. Hallelujah.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; I'll give unto thee the keys to the
[1:51:51] kingdom. Whatsoever you bind on earth
[1:51:53] will be bound in heaven. Whatsoever you
[1:51:55] loose will be loosed. I give you power
[1:51:58] over serpents and over all kinds of
[1:52:01] diseases. I give you power over all
[1:52:04] kinds of diseases. Jesus said it.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said it. And you have
[1:52:10] a right to say it.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; I've received power over all kinds of
[1:52:16] diseases.
[1:52:18] Oh everything and nothing shall harm
[1:52:20] you. Exercise your faith.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Exercise your faith.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; You say, "What if I fail? Did you walk
[1:52:31] the first time you had a a step? Did you
[1:52:34] run and do a high jump when you took
[1:52:36] your first step? Did you ever stumble or
[1:52:39] fall?" You still may do it again, but
[1:52:41] you get right back up and you keep
[1:52:43] exercising because you say, "I can do
[1:52:45] this. I can do this. God said I can do
[1:52:48] it.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; The word of God said I can do it. Jesus
[1:52:52] said I can do it. The prophet said I can
[1:52:55] do it. Hallelujah.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; And I will sooner agree with them than
[1:52:59] even agree with the five senses.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; If I fall, I sooner agree with God's
[1:53:04] word than the fact I fell.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; I failed God.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; We all failed God.
[1:53:12] [Applause]
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:17] All things are possible
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; to them that believe.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Well, we went to prayer service. I heard
[1:53:26] of you praying, Brother Ricard.
[1:53:28] Hallelujah. I know that your daughter
[1:53:30] has got to be on your mind.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; It's not excitement, it's faith.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; And they said in her heart, she shall be
[1:53:42] healed.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; I shall be whole. They shall be whole.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Have you ever had times when it didn't
[1:53:54] happen? Yes.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; I've had times it didn't happen. I had
[1:53:59] times it went sideways. I had times we
[1:54:02] would turn to the medical. I don't
[1:54:04] consider the medical field a failure. I
[1:54:07] don't consider that my faith failed. I
[1:54:10] don't consider that. I just say God,
[1:54:12] however. But nevertheless, I will never
[1:54:15] cease quoting your word. I will never
[1:54:18] cease believing your word. I will not
[1:54:20] allow my faith to be affected by your
[1:54:24] word.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, as a believer, we don't
[1:54:31] have any other option.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; You don't have any other option.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; It's not as though, well, I'll try this.
[1:54:38] There isn't anything else to try. This
[1:54:40] is it.
[1:54:43] This is it.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Let it loose.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; And let God have his way
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; and God will grant it to you.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; I find two classes of people. One, the
[1:54:59] fundamental.
[1:55:00] And the other one, the full gospel.
[1:55:02] They're both fine classes of people. But
[1:55:04] there's the trouble. The fundamental
[1:55:06] knows what they are positionally in
[1:55:09] Christ, but they don't have much faith
[1:55:11] to exercise it. The full gospel's got
[1:55:14] plenty of faith, but they don't know
[1:55:16] what they are.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; So, you have to have all of that. You
[1:55:19] can have all the faith in the world, but
[1:55:20] you have to know who you are.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Just like a man's got a lot of money in
[1:55:27] the bank, but he don't know how to write
[1:55:28] a check. And the other man's got no
[1:55:30] money in the bank, and he knows and he
[1:55:33] knows how to write a check. If I could
[1:55:35] ever get those two together.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; When I have healing services, now watch
[1:55:41] this one closely. When I have healing
[1:55:43] services, hundreds of people that way,
[1:55:45] they come to the platform. Oh, brother
[1:55:47] Brennan, I got all faith. He said, if it
[1:55:51] was ink, in other words, if their faith
[1:55:53] was ink, it wouldn't dot an eye.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; So, you got hope
[1:56:00] instead of faith.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm just hoping. And I'm just hoping
[1:56:04] it won't even dot an eye. It's not
[1:56:07] enough faith to dot an eye. God didn't
[1:56:10] say, "I'll give you enough to dot an
[1:56:13] eye."
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; So, I'll give you enough that all things
[1:56:16] shall be possible.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; I Christ in you.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; I'm the revealed word in you.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; I'm the manifestation of the invisible
[1:56:27] God in you.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. As you confess it, it'll change
[1:56:33] things in your life.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; It'll change things in your whole up
[1:56:37] makeup.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; He said not enough ink to dot an eye.
[1:56:43] See, he said you've got hope instead of
[1:56:45] faith. Faith is positive.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; There's no nothing can move it.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; It's positive.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; No matter how sick you got,
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; how everything went.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Now, if you're trying to bluff it, it
[1:56:58] won't take bluffing. The devil's a bluff
[1:57:00] himself
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; and he knows how to run a bluff.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; But when you got the goods
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; This is the goods.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; When you got the goods
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; and you believe it
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; with unshakable confidence.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; When you got the goods,
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; it don't take loud hollering and it
[1:57:23] doesn't take stomping and screaming. It
[1:57:26] takes faith. and he will recognize it.
[1:57:29] And don't worry, just say the word.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says he's not against
[1:57:35] he's not against shouting. He's not
[1:57:36] against hollering. He said he does it
[1:57:38] and I'm a Baptist. He said,
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; He says, "And when you get healed and
[1:57:42] God does something for you, of course
[1:57:44] you shout and you holler.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Don't let that dampen you.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; God's done lots for us here.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; You have a lot to shout and and thank
[1:57:53] God for."
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:59] He may save you. Not he may.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; He will.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; He has.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; He's just only wanting you to believe it
[1:58:09] and exercise a little faith.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; You are saved.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; You are saved. Joel,
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; you are saved.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Brothers, sisters.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; God did do. It wasn't you at camp. It
[1:58:23] was God at camp.
[1:58:25] It's not you just in not me just
[1:58:27] preaching it. It's God doing it.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; God is telling you who you are.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; You won't even want to be around
[1:58:35] negative people.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Let the balcony say amen.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You believe it.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; God's greater than your problem and your
[1:58:53] need.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; You believe it.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Can you do that? Can you believe tonight
[1:59:09] for anything? Oh my brother, sister, if
[1:59:12] you could only take a hold yonder and
[1:59:14] say, "Yes, Lord Jesus, I believe it." If
[1:59:17] you believe it deep enough in your
[1:59:18] heart, there's not enough devils in this
[1:59:23] country
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; to keep you from being healed tonight.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; There's not enough devils in North
[1:59:31] America, in the United States, in
[1:59:33] Canada, in Europe. Not enough devils. He
[1:59:37] said it.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; You know, I've come to the place I'm not
[1:59:42] even going to try to see people healed.
[1:59:44] I'm just going to do what the word says.
[1:59:46] I'm not going to try to even see them
[1:59:48] sealed. I'm just going to see see them
[1:59:50] saved. I'm just going to do what the
[1:59:52] word says. Preach the gospel. Lay hands
[1:59:54] on the sick.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God does the rest.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; I can't give you a revelation.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; I've striven sometimes to give a
[2:00:03] revelation. The opening of the word in
[2:00:05] the third pull. He's the revealer.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; He's the one that's going to make it
[2:00:10] revealed to you.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Not enough devils.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you have trusted me to be
[2:00:21] the servant of the Lord,
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; I want a positive response
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; out of this.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Do you trust
[2:00:31] Brother Brandham as a true servant
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; of the Lord?"
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; He's laying this out to the people
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; and that I have preached to you the
[2:00:41] Bible. And I say amen.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; You have indeed, servant of God, prophet
[2:00:46] of God, you have indeed preached
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; the truth of the Bible.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; For Christ has come down and permitted
[2:00:54] me to prove to you that he is here
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; and living and raised from the dead.
[2:01:00] Then hear me speak the solemn truth.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; He was wounded for your transgressions.
[2:01:06] And with his stripes, you were healed.
[2:01:09] You've got the power in you. If you've
[2:01:13] got the faith to exercise and do you
[2:01:16] believe it as a servant of God, I say
[2:01:20] yay and amen. That's what Jesus said.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; That's what pro the prophet of God said.
[2:01:27] That's what his messenger said.
[2:01:29] Vindicated messenger
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; as a solemn statement.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; He's saying that to us.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:40] You've got the power in you.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; You've got the sixth sense in you.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; If you have the faith to exercise it,
[2:01:51] and faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[2:01:53] the word of God, and that's what you're
[2:01:55] hearing today.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Whether you realize it or not, faith,
[2:01:59] the level of faith is rising
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; within you.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; There was a young man there. Brother
[2:02:06] Bram says, "Young man," he addressed
[2:02:07] him, "you've been bound for some time,
[2:02:09] too, haven't you? You believe Jesus?"
[2:02:11] Look, young man, you'll be bound to that
[2:02:14] chair as long as you live if you don't
[2:02:16] exercise faith and believe he's in a
[2:02:18] wheelchair. Do you believe it now that
[2:02:21] you're sitting in his presence? You do.
[2:02:23] He may not have felt anything special,
[2:02:26] but he says you do. You You do. He's
[2:02:28] asking, "All right. Won't you rise up in
[2:02:31] the name of Jesus Christ and walk on
[2:02:33] out? You're not bound anymore with the
[2:02:37] powers of hell.
[2:02:44] [Music]
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:47] [Applause]
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; He said the Bible said this is in who is
[2:02:55] God.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Let me just go for a few more minutes
[2:02:58] please.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Who is God? He says, "No wonder cripples
[2:03:02] when you realize that can straighten
[2:03:04] out. The creator's here.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; No wonder blind and they can't see opens
[2:03:11] up. The creator's here.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; The creator. They realize he says the
[2:03:16] Bible said we are sons and daughters of
[2:03:20] God.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; His offspring." Now,
[2:03:24] now then you're something like God was.
[2:03:28] Jesus said himself, "It is written,
[2:03:31] you're God's written in your law. We
[2:03:34] become a part of God, a son of God by
[2:03:37] adoption through Jesus Christ. You'll
[2:03:40] become a daughter and a son of God by
[2:03:42] adoption through Jesus Christ. Jesus
[2:03:45] Christ adopted you,
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; gave you his name,
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; gave you his nature,
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; and brought you into the family
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; through his blood."
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; You're birthed by the blood.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; The blood of God,
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; therefore, if you realize that the very
[2:04:07] God that made the dirt and the earth and
[2:04:10] whatever is here is living among men,
[2:04:13] where's your faith at, friends? And he
[2:04:15] said, "These things do I when he was
[2:04:17] here on earth, greater shall you do, for
[2:04:20] I go to my father. Whatsoever things you
[2:04:23] desire when you pray,
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; believe that you receive them,
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; you shall have them.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; That's the creator speaking.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Then
[2:04:48] quoting him, then it doesn't lay in him.
[2:04:53] It lays in you.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Wow. This goes way beyond your
[2:05:01] understanding.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; Goes way beyond
[2:05:06] what you can figure out by your senses.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Right. You don't feel that.
[2:05:12] You'll never feel that.
[2:05:15] But you can cause this mouth to say it.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; And you can cause your mind to think and
[2:05:23] ponder it and to pray
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; and to pray.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Make that real. Oh God, make that real.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:35] He said, "When this growth is dead,
[2:05:43] that's why I had Lyall on my heart so
[2:05:45] much."
[2:05:48] And I trust he's listening.
[2:05:51] When this growth is dead, it shrinks.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; The patient rejoices. Oh, how happy. in
[2:05:58] a few days and they find themselves
[2:05:59] worse off
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; than when they were in the first place.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Now, what are your senses going to say?
[2:06:05] Your senses are going to say, "I'm worse
[2:06:07] off."
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Listen to how a seventh grade educated
[2:06:15] Kuckian speaks. It's not the Kuckian
[2:06:19] education, friends. This happens to be
[2:06:21] the throne of God speaking. This happens
[2:06:24] to be the creator
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; who flung stars into space.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; Hear him.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Hear him.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "And they're worse off than
[2:06:41] they were in the first place. Oh well,
[2:06:43] they say, I guess I lost my healing."
[2:06:46] And just as sure as faith taken it away,
[2:06:50] unbelief resurrects it again.
[2:06:53] [Applause]
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; As sure as faith takes it away, unbelief
[2:07:00] resurrects it again. I'm preaching to
[2:07:02] you, friends.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; He said, furthermore, you you're healed
[2:07:11] as long as you believe it.
[2:07:13] And he said, "You're also saved as long
[2:07:16] as you believe it."
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; If you cease believing that you're
[2:07:20] saved, then it will resurrect the
[2:07:23] darkness
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; and give Satan an open door.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Whenever he comes, that's the most
[2:07:30] subtle thing. Say, "You don't feel
[2:07:31] saved." Forget how you feel.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; You failed God. Forget your failures.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got something in you
[2:07:40] that's greater than your failure.
[2:07:44] It's called the power of God.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Don't sink back down. There's too many.
[2:07:50] That's why I'm preaching this way
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; amongst the house of God, amongst the
[2:07:55] bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:09] whatsoever things you desire when you
[2:08:11] pray that it doesn't lay in him, it lays
[2:08:14] in you.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; He says, "And then we fellowship with
[2:08:17] Adam,
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; lost in the fall, Christ restored in his
[2:08:21] death."
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; To bring man back into fellowship with
[2:08:26] God. Now he says, "Now the church has
[2:08:29] moved up to that fellowship with God.
[2:08:32] Communion like Adam in the beginning in
[2:08:35] the Garden of Eden, taking all sin away,
[2:08:37] free from condemnation, Holy Spirit
[2:08:39] cleansing us from all sin. Now you're
[2:08:42] free to exercise. And this is why I read
[2:08:45] this whole quote. Now you are free to
[2:08:48] exercise the next step in God.
[2:08:53] [Applause]
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say, "Bring it on.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Bring it down.
[2:09:01] Bring the next step.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; Now you're ready to exercise the next
[2:09:06] step in God.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; You young men, young ba, young families,
[2:09:15] young people, you can lay hands on one
[2:09:18] another.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; I had a friend, Billy Andrews. You know
[2:09:23] Billy Andrews? He got a growth on his
[2:09:26] nose and every morning that he shaved,
[2:09:28] he had that growth on the side of his
[2:09:30] nose. He and he told me personally he
[2:09:34] had that thing for months. He said, "I
[2:09:36] laid my finger on it every morning and
[2:09:38] cursed it in the name of Jesus Christ."
[2:09:41] He didn't come running back and say, "Is
[2:09:42] it gone?"
[2:09:44] As long as it was there, he cursed it
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. He says,
[2:09:50] "And one day it just dropped off."
[2:09:52] Hallelujah.
[2:09:53] Hallelujah.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; He believed it.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; He believed something was happening when
[2:09:59] he put his finger on it.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; I curse it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; God's against these things.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Satan wants us to become accustomed to
[2:10:11] sickness and accustom. Oh, get your
[2:10:13] shots. And are you afraid of shot? No,
[2:10:14] I'm not afraid of a shot. I got a
[2:10:16] greater shot than anything you put in my
[2:10:18] arm.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; They've been trying to get me to take a
[2:10:20] flu shot. your age, you need to take the
[2:10:23] flu shot. They they just pages full of
[2:10:26] advertising and H12N or who knows what
[2:10:29] how many N's, all these flu and and then
[2:10:32] they ended up I said I said to my wife,
[2:10:34] "This thing's a hoax.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; This thing's a hoax. They're coming up
[2:10:38] from the States because they run out of
[2:10:40] flu stuff down there and they're lined
[2:10:41] up there and I I watched the lineup,
[2:10:44] Brother Tom, what they're all talking,
[2:10:47] oh, they're so happy we can get our flu
[2:10:49] shot. Hallelujah. I'm glad I got one in
[2:10:52] church
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; long before that flu shot came along.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:59] [Applause]
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; I'm standing here as a testimony.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; You folks that have gone sick into bed,
[2:11:11] I don't I don't say anything about it. I
[2:11:13] say God raise faith in your heart.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; I and my wife haven't had a flu for so
[2:11:21] many years, we can't even remember. And
[2:11:23] of course, a good thing we forget what
[2:11:25] we did yesterday.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; We just I can hardly remember being
[2:11:32] sick.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; God's our healer.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And most of the time if I
[2:11:41] don't get feeling very good, I generally
[2:11:43] come to work or come to church anyway.
[2:11:45] You don't know how many times I sat
[2:11:46] here. I did. I I didn't feel I wanted to
[2:11:49] be here, but I sat here because I'm
[2:11:51] better off here.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; I'm better off under the word of God.
[2:11:55] I'm better off in the atmosphere
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; and I'm just as sick at home, so I might
[2:11:59] as well be here.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, I don't feel very good. I
[2:12:03] guess I'll stay home." That's no excuse.
[2:12:05] If you don't feel good, come to the
[2:12:07] house of God.
[2:12:09] [Music]
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; Is this all right, folks?
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; I'm over time.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; But I just have to
[2:12:26] the growth is dead and it shrinks and
[2:12:28] your unbelief will resurrect it again.
[2:12:31] He says, "But when you get sick after
[2:12:32] about 72 hours, you're supposed to." He
[2:12:35] said, "A dead ball of flesh in your
[2:12:37] body, what purifies the blood?" The
[2:12:40] heart purifies the blood and the heart
[2:12:42] pumps it and causes an infection. causes
[2:12:46] fever and all kinds of feelings and
[2:12:48] sickness. And after 72 hours, if you've
[2:12:52] been prayed for with cancer, tumor, or
[2:12:55] anything, and you begin to get real sick
[2:12:57] and a high fever, that's one of the best
[2:13:00] signs in the world that you're healed.
[2:13:03] Just keep on.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; See, your faith is not what you feel.
[2:13:07] Your faith is what you believe. Amen.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; If you really believe it,
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; I don't care how you feel,
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; you'll you'd never never say you wasn't
[2:13:19] healed.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; You'd always believe it.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; That's what does it.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; That's what exactly the woman who went
[2:13:27] through the press. That's what she had.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; It was already done.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; She was holding the substance when she
[2:13:33] reached through and touched his garment.
[2:13:35] Amen.
[2:13:36] [Music]
[2:13:36] [Applause]
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; Okay. Quickly,
[2:13:50] I'm I'm going to just something I have
[2:13:52] to come to.
[2:14:00] I want to read I want to read a
[2:14:02] scripture
[2:14:04] and then uh
[2:14:06] if you if you'd sooner just have the
[2:14:08] note down it'll be fine.
[2:14:11] Now
[2:14:14] I'm kind of reaching out.
[2:14:16] This is where it's not just so you know
[2:14:19] fundamental
[2:14:22] things.
[2:14:25] Uh
[2:14:26] now we've come to
[2:14:29] a a ministry that was an unusual
[2:14:31] ministry.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; That said, turn my back. Somebody's
[2:14:36] touching the Holy Spirit. The woman
[2:14:39] right here. He said something about one
[2:14:42] woman
[2:14:43] and uh she didn't identify. He says,
[2:14:46] "Are you standing up?" Oh, no. He said,
[2:14:48] "She's not standing up." So he then he
[2:14:50] turned and I think he even spoke her
[2:14:52] name and then turned around and says,
[2:14:53] "Stand up." Well, it wasn't hard for her
[2:14:55] to stand up when she heard her name.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; And now we've had this kind of ministry.
[2:15:01] Don't let it get common to you. Now
[2:15:03] watch very close.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; Please watch very close.
[2:15:10] When this one now
[2:15:13] was going through the process, the word
[2:15:16] had become flesh.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; And the flesh man went to Calvary.
[2:15:23] And then
[2:15:25] he was resurrected.
[2:15:28] And one of the women, I believe Mary,
[2:15:31] came and Jesus said to her, "Woman, why
[2:15:35] weepest thou? Whom seekest thou?" And
[2:15:39] she supposing him to be the gardener,
[2:15:43] said to him, "Sir, if you have borne him
[2:15:46] hence, tell me where you have laid him,
[2:15:50] and I will take him away." She's uh
[2:15:52] still hanging fast to that person, the
[2:15:56] man Jesus Christ of Nazareth, who did
[2:16:00] all of these things. And she's hanging
[2:16:02] at him. He's speaking to her. But things
[2:16:04] have changed.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right?
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; There's another phase. It's the same
[2:16:09] Jesus,
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; but he's in a different form.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; And Jesus and and then said, "And and I
[2:16:17] will take him away." And Jesus said to
[2:16:19] her, "Mary,"
[2:16:21] called her by name, too.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; And she turned herself,
[2:16:27] and said unto him, Raboni, which is to
[2:16:31] say, "Master."
[2:16:33] And Jesus saith unto her, "Touch me not,
[2:16:40] for I am not yet ascended."
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; He had to ascend with the blood. I've
[2:16:46] not yet ascended
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; to my father,
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; but go to your go to my brethren and say
[2:16:53] unto them, I ascend unto my father and
[2:16:57] your father
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; and to my God and your God.
[2:17:02] Hallelujah.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; And then another account,
[2:17:08] he apparently had ascended and descended
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; because he was with the apostles and
[2:17:14] disciples and believers for some days.
[2:17:17] And as they went to tell his disciples,
[2:17:21] as he went as they went to tell his
[2:17:23] disciples, behold, Jesus met them,
[2:17:27] saying, "All hail." And they came and
[2:17:31] held him by the feet and worshiped him.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; And then Jesus on the mat on Luke the
[2:17:40] 24th chapter. Listen very closely and
[2:17:42] don't be please don't don't let your
[2:17:44] mind get fogged up. In Luke the 24th
[2:17:48] chapter, the second last service that
[2:17:51] the prophet of God spoke out of Luke 24.
[2:17:55] And he called the two men on the way to
[2:17:57] Emmas. modern events made clear by the
[2:18:01] prophecy.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; And this was the prophecy.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; And by him speaking it, it would become
[2:18:07] clear
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; by him speaking it. And the Lord and and
[2:18:12] and these people, these men were saying,
[2:18:14] "And the Lord is risen indeed and hath
[2:18:17] appeared unto Simon."
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; And they now these two are telling the
[2:18:21] other apostles what has happened. And
[2:18:24] they told what things were done in the
[2:18:26] way, and how he was known of them in
[2:18:29] breaking of bread. And as they thus
[2:18:32] spoke, Jesus himself stood in the midst
[2:18:35] of them, and said unto them, "Peace be
[2:18:38] unto you."
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; And they were terrified
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; and afrighted, and supposed that they
[2:18:44] had seen a spirit. Now, folks, it's
[2:18:47] another it's another way. It's another
[2:18:49] form.
[2:18:51] This is a lesson for all of you that are
[2:18:53] in school education. It's another form.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; And they were terrified and thought
[2:18:59] they'd seen a spirit. And he said unto
[2:19:01] them, "Why are you troubled?
[2:19:04] And why do thoughts arise in your
[2:19:05] heart?" See, they couldn't sort it all
[2:19:07] out either. Sometimes we can't sort it
[2:19:09] all out. That doesn't change what God's
[2:19:11] doing. Don't give up on it. Don't revert
[2:19:14] back to your senses because you can't
[2:19:16] figure it all out. And he says, "And why
[2:19:19] do these thoughts arise in your hearts?"
[2:19:21] And then he says, "Behold my hands
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; and my feet.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; It is I myself
[2:19:30] handle me.
[2:19:40] For a spirit hath not flesh and bones.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; And when he had thus spoken,
[2:19:48] he showed them his hands
[2:19:52] and his feet.
[2:19:57] 2,000 years.
[2:20:00] About 2,000 years later, the whole scene
[2:20:03] is going to change again.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:07] and Luke 17:30 must be fulfilled.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; Squeeze your mind now. Pinch it.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; And when the day of Sodom and the day of
[2:20:18] Noah,
[2:20:20] in that day I'll be revealed. I
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; who's here showing his hands and his
[2:20:25] feet.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; I will be revealed.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Who could reveal it more than he
[2:20:31] himself?
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; He'll be the one that'll be standing at
[2:20:34] the platform. He'll be the one who's
[2:20:36] speaking through that seventh age
[2:20:38] messenger. He'll be the one who's doing
[2:20:40] all of these things. He'll be the one
[2:20:42] who is speaking to the bride, his own
[2:20:44] bride, through that messenger. And thus
[2:20:47] it would have to go on tape. And thus it
[2:20:49] would still be on voice. And thus it
[2:20:51] would be in message books. And thus you
[2:20:53] would hear it. And thus it would be
[2:20:54] conveyed to you. And then he and and and
[2:20:56] then that messenger he coming. Is this
[2:20:59] earth? Is this the sign of the end? And
[2:21:02] he goes to Revelation 10:1. And now this
[2:21:05] mighty angel is descending from heaven
[2:21:08] and he has in his hand
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; the same hand. Hallelujah. And he's
[2:21:15] holding a book and the book is open. And
[2:21:18] the prophet said it was a Bible and it's
[2:21:20] open. The book is open. Your name was in
[2:21:24] the book. Your life was in the book. He
[2:21:27] was holding it in his hand. The hand
[2:21:29] that had scores in it. Now he's
[2:21:31] descending. And when he's descending the
[2:21:34] next the next line says and he set one
[2:21:36] foot
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; on the land and he set the other foot on
[2:21:41] the sea. He set it on the peoples
[2:21:43] because this is the hour of the
[2:21:46] revelation of himself and he's saying to
[2:21:50] his disciples because he was seeking to
[2:21:53] get them to believe that the
[2:21:55] resurrection had happened.
[2:21:58] And as a final proof in the end time, he
[2:22:02] descends with the open book
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; to prove he's resurrected.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; And it was then he said, "Handle me."
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; Handle me.
[2:22:16] [Applause]
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; And the Apostle John said, "Whom our
[2:22:20] eyes have seen
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; and our hands have handled." He didn't
[2:22:25] say handled. Jesus of Nazareth, he said,
[2:22:28] "Handle the word of life."
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; Touch him.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Touch him.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; Handle him.
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Handle me."
[2:22:46] [Applause]
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; You say, "It's not just a message.
[2:22:50] Handle me." It's him.
[2:22:53] If you can get a revelation of him being
[2:22:56] here,
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; we're touching him. Brother Isaac,
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; handle him.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; He's inviting. Handle me.
[2:23:06] [Music]
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; Another woman.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; He was the tree
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; that was in Eden.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; Said, "You can't le put their hand forth
[2:23:16] and touch him."
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; They can't do that in that fallen state.
[2:23:21] But once they've been justified,
[2:23:25] once they've been redeemed,
[2:23:27] they can come and touch me. They can
[2:23:30] handle me.
[2:23:36] [Applause]
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; Come my brothers and sisters,
[2:23:44] handle him.
[2:23:45] [Music]
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Talk to him. Amen.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Kindle the fire
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; touch him
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; in such a way that the fire can never be
[2:23:59] extinguished.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; You won't have to put all your faith in
[2:24:04] even a camp in a Saturday night. Thank
[2:24:07] God for it.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; I thank God for it. And may we have many
[2:24:11] more.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; But the fire that was kindled
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; is a reality.
[2:24:19] Hallelujah.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; That same one said, "Who touched me?"
[2:24:29] But then as a proof of his resurrection
[2:24:31] and to get his people to prove, to get
[2:24:34] his people to believe abundantly without
[2:24:36] any question, it's not a spirit. It's
[2:24:39] me, it's myself.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; I've just changed. I'm in another realm.
[2:24:44] I'm in another dimension.
[2:24:47] But the resurrection has happened.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; And to prove it, come and handle me.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; I want to say to this church,
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; I want to say to all of you that are
[2:24:55] streaming,
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus Christ
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; has been given this honor.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; Not to just talk about him,
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; not to just repeat what he said,
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; not just to say about what he done, but
[2:25:08] to but you can have a personal
[2:25:10] acquaintance and experience with him.
[2:25:12] And he is saying to you, I have never
[2:25:15] even dreamed of such a subject in my
[2:25:17] life. I've been pondering it for some
[2:25:20] weeks. Handle me.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; Handle me.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; I've been singing a song.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; I love very dearly.
[2:25:32] There's people who aren't here in this
[2:25:34] church. I wish they were here this
[2:25:35] morning.
[2:25:37] I feel badly.
[2:25:42] I'm having my wife come and sing
[2:25:46] with her daughters.
[2:25:57] They'll sing it a lot better than I can.
[2:26:03] Brother Alan King, this was I think
[2:26:04] became famous in England. Brother
[2:26:07] Fletcher, if you're here,
[2:26:11] I touched
[2:26:13] the heart of God in prayer.
[2:26:18] I lingered
[2:26:20] in his presence there.
[2:26:24] I lost
[2:26:26] my heavy load of care
[2:26:30] when in prayer
[2:26:32] I touched the heart of God.
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; They will sing it for you.
[2:26:44] My wife doesn't like to sing as other
[2:26:46] people sing and all the rest of it.
[2:26:54] And I might even try along with them.
[2:27:04] Please make sure that Where's Michael?
[2:27:07] I'd asked him to be there. Are you
[2:27:09] there? Good.
[2:27:15] Now, this part, you came to church, but
[2:27:17] this part is my part of the service.
[2:27:21] I've been wanting my wife to sing this
[2:27:23] song for years,
[2:27:26] years. And so I'm having that fulfilled.
[2:27:30] Brother Mike Gier, I listened to you
[2:27:32] sing again
[2:27:34] last night.
[2:27:36] One of the last things I went to bed
[2:27:38] listening I'll die believeing.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; That was God that made you sing that.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:52] Thank you for your time.
[2:27:56] [Music]
[2:28:19] When I was burdened
[2:28:24] down
[2:28:26] with care,
[2:28:28] I knelt with God
[2:28:32] aart.
[2:28:36] I stretched my hands
[2:28:40] to him in prayer
[2:28:45] and touched
[2:28:47] his loving
[2:28:49] heart.
[2:28:54] I touched
[2:28:57] the heart of God in prayer.
[2:29:04] I lingered
[2:29:07] in his presence there.
[2:29:13] I lost
[2:29:15] my heavy load of care.
[2:29:20] [Music]
[2:29:23] When in prayer
[2:29:26] I touched the heart of God.
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; His heart is love
[2:29:40] and tenderness.
[2:29:42] [Music]
[2:29:44] He feels the pain
[2:29:49] we feel.
[2:29:50] [Music]
[2:29:53] He waits
[2:29:55] the needy
[2:29:57] heart
[2:29:59] to bless.
[2:30:01] His touch
[2:30:03] can save and heal.
[2:30:11] I touched
[2:30:14] the heart of God in prayer.
[2:30:20] I lingered
[2:30:23] in his presence there.
[2:30:29] I lost
[2:30:32] my heavy load of care.
[2:30:39] When in prayer,
[2:30:43] I touched the heart
[2:30:48] of God.
[2:30:53] I touched
[2:30:55] the heart of God. In prayer,
[2:31:02] I lingered
[2:31:05] in his presence there.
[2:31:09] [Applause]
[2:31:12] I lost
[2:31:15] my heavy load of care.
[2:31:22] When in prayer
[2:31:26] I touched the heart
[2:31:31] of God.
[2:31:36] He touched me.
[2:31:40] Oh,
[2:31:42] he touched me.
[2:31:47] And all
[2:31:50] the joy that floods my soul.
[2:31:59] Something
[2:32:01] happened
[2:32:03] and now
[2:32:10] he touched me
[2:32:13] and made
[2:32:16] me whole.
[2:32:22] and
[2:32:23] a heavy
[2:32:26] burden
[2:32:29] [Music]
[2:32:33] of lift it up now.

[2:32:45] touched me
[2:32:49] and

[2:37:38] [Music]
[2:37:41] &gt;&gt; I wonder, brother Darren Hoffman, if you
[2:37:44] would come,
[2:37:47] pray a prayer of blessing upon the
[2:37:49] people.
[2:37:51] Brother Murphy is speaking tonight.
[2:37:56] [Music]
[2:37:58] I'm anxious to hear what God has to say
[2:38:00] to us.
[2:38:02] [Music]
[2:38:04] How many here have been touched by God
[2:38:08] in a supernatural way in the last while
[2:38:12] in the prayer meetings?
[2:38:16] Brother Kyle is told me the place is
[2:38:19] full.
[2:38:21] 60 to 70 people in the prayer meeting.
[2:38:23] You're invited to come.
[2:38:26] God bless you.
[2:38:28] God bless you, brothers, sisters.
[2:38:34] You're much loved
[2:38:36] of the father. Brother Darren, if you
[2:38:39] would come, please.
[2:38:42] [Music]
[2:38:50] Let's bow our heads.
[2:38:55] Heavenly Father, I'm so grateful for the
[2:38:58] faith of Jesus Christ that you've
[2:39:00] deposited within the lives of your
[2:39:02] people, Lord.
[2:39:04] Father, it doesn't matter whether on the
[2:39:05] mountaintop, down in the valley, dear
[2:39:07] God, whether it's the good times, the
[2:39:09] bad times. Lord God, there's something
[2:39:12] just pushing up within our hearts, Lord,
[2:39:14] just to praise you, to worship you, Lord
[2:39:17] God, to know that your word is real,
[2:39:19] Lord Jesus. People can say, "Well, how
[2:39:21] do you know?" Because I've experienced
[2:39:23] it, Lord. How we have a people that have
[2:39:25] experienced the presence of Jesus Christ
[2:39:27] in their individual lives, have
[2:39:29] experienced the hand of God transforming
[2:39:31] them from creatures of time to creatures
[2:39:34] of eternity, Lord.
[2:39:35] &gt;&gt; And dear God, how we're so thankful,
[2:39:37] Lord Jesus, that Lord, you've made us
[2:39:40] different, Lord. And the devil, he's
[2:39:41] howling, dear God. You're you're making
[2:39:43] us ready for a rapture, Lord. how that's
[2:39:46] on our hearts, dear Lord, just to be
[2:39:47] ready, Lord. And not just ourselves,
[2:39:50] Father, but for our children, for our
[2:39:51] loved ones, Lord, to get our family,
[2:39:54] dear God, into the household of faith,
[2:39:56] Lord, to have each one of us prepared,
[2:39:58] Lord Jesus, for that going home time,
[2:40:01] Lord Jesus, we just remember your
[2:40:03] people, Lord God, we would you just
[2:40:05] raise up our faith, dear Lord. We just
[2:40:07] cast down our doubts, Father. We just
[2:40:10] put aside the the the the thoughts the
[2:40:12] devil would try to put into our minds,
[2:40:14] dear God, to try to doubt us, Lord, but
[2:40:16] he's nothing but a liar. Every time he
[2:40:18] opens his mouth, Lord Jesus, he's just
[2:40:20] lying, Lord. So, Father, this morning,
[2:40:23] we're standing upon thus sayeth the
[2:40:25] Lord. We're standing upon a vindicated
[2:40:27] ministry, Lord Jesus. Lord, that you've
[2:40:30] sent down this hour with an open book,
[2:40:32] dear Lord. We've seen our names there,
[2:40:34] Father. We rejoice, Lord God, because
[2:40:37] you've redeemed us back to yourself,
[2:40:39] Lord. There's a marriage supper, dear
[2:40:41] God, that we've have a a reservation in,
[2:40:44] Father, that you've invited us
[2:40:46] personally, dear God. We have a spot,
[2:40:48] Lord. We have a chair at that table,
[2:40:50] dear God, where no one else can fit,
[2:40:52] Lord. We thank you, Lord God, that
[2:40:54] you've come to each one of us, Lord
[2:40:56] Jesus. You've given us a word in due
[2:40:59] season. You've made modern events clear
[2:41:01] by prophecy, Lord God. Lord, just
[2:41:04] continue to unveil yourself to us, Lord.
[2:41:07] Continue to open up our eyes, Lord.
[2:41:09] Continue to fill us up with revelation,
[2:41:11] Lord. Lord, that we would not see with
[2:41:13] our natural eyes. We would look beyond
[2:41:15] the things of this world, Lord God, the
[2:41:17] turmoil, Lord, but we would look to the
[2:41:20] unseen, Father. We would look to the
[2:41:22] hills from whence cometh our help, Lord.
[2:41:24] Our help cometh from the Lord God
[2:41:27] himself. So, Lord Jesus, we're just
[2:41:29] reaching out to you this morning in
[2:41:31] faith, dear God. Lord Jesus, just
[2:41:33] accepting what you've said, Lord, in
[2:41:35] your word. Accepting what you've brought
[2:41:37] forth through our pastor this morning,
[2:41:39] Lord. We are believers, Lord. We're
[2:41:41] standing on thus saith the Lord. Oh,
[2:41:44] God. We're rejecting everything this
[2:41:46] world would try to lure us away with,
[2:41:48] Lord. All the world, Lord God, would
[2:41:50] burning the bridges behind us. Father,
[2:41:52] we're moving on with God. We're going
[2:41:54] forward, Lord Jesus. We're staggering
[2:41:57] not at the promises of God, Lord, like
[2:41:59] our father Abraham. Lord, 25 years he
[2:42:02] waited for the promise. He staggered
[2:42:04] not, Lord. But he was strong, Lord God,
[2:42:07] through faith, Lord Jesus. We're strong
[2:42:10] through the faith of Jesus Christ, Lord,
[2:42:12] that you're building up in our lives,
[2:42:14] dear God. No matter what comes by our
[2:42:17] way, Lord, nothing can deter us, Lord.
[2:42:19] Nothing can separate us from the love of
[2:42:21] God that's in Christ Jesus. Oh God, not
[2:42:25] trials, not tribulations, Lord. Nothing,
[2:42:28] Lord, God will separate us, Lord. Not
[2:42:30] one of us will be plucked from your
[2:42:32] hand, Lord Jesus. So we give you the
[2:42:35] glory. We give you the honor and the
[2:42:36] praise, Lord, for you are holy. You are
[2:42:40] worthy, dear Lord. You are worthy, Lord
[2:42:43] God. Oh God, take away the formalities,
[2:42:47] Lord Jesus. Take away the rituals, Lord
[2:42:50] God. We just want to be free, Lord. Free
[2:42:52] to be used of God. Free to be a blessing
[2:42:55] to others, Lord. free to be a witness of
[2:42:58] the resurrection, Lord, in this hour.
[2:43:01] Oh, we praise you, Lord God. We bless
[2:43:03] your holy name. You're worthy of it all,
[2:43:06] Lord Jesus. We glorify you, Lord. Oh, we
[2:43:10] thank you, Father. We never want to let
[2:43:13] this become common to us, Lord. But just
[2:43:15] let that fus continue to burn within our
[2:43:18] souls as we press on this way. Lord, go
[2:43:21] with your people, Father. Give us rest
[2:43:24] in our bodies, strength, Lord God, to
[2:43:27] come tonight, Lord Jesus, to hear the
[2:43:29] word of God once again through brother
[2:43:31] Murphy. Let us come, Lord, just pulling
[2:43:33] upon the gift, expecting, Lord, great
[2:43:36] things, Lord Jesus, because our faith is
[2:43:39] doing great, Lord. We appreciate you,
[2:43:42] Lord. We just thank you for answering
[2:43:44] prayers, Lord. We know the answer is on
[2:43:46] its way, Lord. So, we're just waiting
[2:43:48] for it, Father, with great expectation,
[2:43:51] Lord, to strengthen our dear pastor,
[2:43:53] Lord. We so thank you for the man of
[2:43:56] God. We so thank you for a vision, Lord.
[2:43:59] We thank you for a body, Lord, a body
[2:44:02] ministry that ministers one to the
[2:44:04] other. It's just not men behind the
[2:44:06] pulpit, Lord. Men who labor, Lord. We
[2:44:08] appreciate that so much. But Lord,
[2:44:11] you're showing us, Lord, it's a body
[2:44:13] ministry, Lord. It's teamwork. It's one
[2:44:16] praying for the other, Lord. It's one
[2:44:18] pressing on, helping one another, Lord.
[2:44:21] Each one of us have a part to play,
[2:44:23] Lord. And so, we just want to walk, Lord
[2:44:25] Jesus, in the word as you unveil it
[2:44:28] before us. Go with your people now,
[2:44:30] Father. We just ask your blessings upon
[2:44:32] us in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:44:39] &gt;&gt; And now I say this to you that
[2:44:42] uh I would encourage you to take and
[2:44:44] read,
[2:44:46] not just read, let this resurrected one
[2:44:50] that's present here that sent this
[2:44:53] message to you. If you take modern
[2:44:56] events made clear by prophecy and when
[2:44:59] you open it up, he's in another form.
[2:45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:05] But it is the same Christ.
[2:45:08] &gt;&gt; The same one that walked with the two
[2:45:10] men to Emmas will be wherever you are.
[2:45:14] &gt;&gt; And and and listen, I could say so much.
[2:45:17] I'm I'm going to let you go. But the two
[2:45:19] men when you're reading it, the two men,
[2:45:22] Luke 24, and they they walked with him
[2:45:25] and talked with him and they got to
[2:45:28] their house and he even took the he even
[2:45:31] took the bread and broke it. They didn't
[2:45:33] say, "Oh, look at the nail scars."
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; They weren't there
[2:45:40] &gt;&gt; in that form. They weren't there.
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; That same one who I talked about today,
[2:45:46] the same one who Brother Brandham
[2:45:48] declared for 33 years is going to talk
[2:45:51] to you if you'll believe it.
[2:45:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:55] &gt;&gt; And you'll be able to reach him and
[2:45:57] touch him.
[2:45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:59] &gt;&gt; As you hear him speak,
[2:46:03] And you people, that's what will make
[2:46:06] this church a different church
[2:46:08] &gt;&gt; if you realize it's him
[2:46:11] &gt;&gt; speaking to you.
[2:46:13] &gt;&gt; And I say to you in the name of the
[2:46:15] Lord, handle him.
[2:46:19] [Music]
[2:46:21] &gt;&gt; Handle him.
[2:46:23] &gt;&gt; Become attached.
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; A fire kindled.
[2:46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; Do it. You're not too young. You're not
[2:46:31] too old. God bless you in Jesus name.
[2:46:34] You're dismissed. We'll see you this
[2:46:36] evening. God willing. God bless you.
[2:46:42] [Music]
