[7:22] [Music]
[7:24] Man, I'm gonna ask Sister Linda and
[7:26] Sister Florence,
[7:29] uh, come help me sing a song.
[7:33] Brother Ryan,
[7:35] you know, when you win a victory
[7:38] like Moses did, Lord told Moses,
[7:43] he said,
[7:46] "Go into Pharaoh, for I've hardened his
[7:49] heart, the heart of his servants, that I
[7:51] might show these signs before him." That
[7:54] was the reason he hardened his heart, so
[7:56] he could show the signs. and that thou
[7:59] mayest tell in the ears of thy son and
[8:01] of thy sons sons what things I have
[8:03] wrought in Egypt and my signs which I
[8:06] have done among them that ye might know
[8:08] that I am the Lord. So you know when
[8:10] these victories happen you know we need
[8:13] to start we need to rehearse them.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; You know in Joel prophet Joel says tell
[8:18] your children of it and let your
[8:20] children tell their children and their
[8:22] children
[8:23] &gt;&gt; another generation.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; God's restored. Amen. And we have the
[8:29] we've got the victory this morning,
[8:31] saints. We're going to sing this little
[8:33] song. We've sung it before and and uh I
[8:35] want to make sure everybody knows it. So
[8:37] when we sing the chorus uh together, you
[8:40] know, you can sing it. This song just
[8:41] keeps going over and over in my mind.
[8:43] And uh trust that you'd uh sing along
[8:46] with us this morning. You can have your
[8:47] seats.
[8:54] [Music]
[9:10] Many times I've questioned
[9:14] certain circumstances
[9:18] or things I could not understand.
[9:21] [Music]
[9:25] Many times in trials,
[9:28] weakness blurs my vision.
[9:32] That's when my frustration
[9:34] gets so out of hand.
[9:39] But it's then I am reminded
[9:42] that I've never been forsaken
[9:46] and I've never had to stand one test
[9:50] alone.
[9:53] As I look at all the victories, then the
[9:57] spirit rises up in me. And it's through
[10:01] the fire my weakness is made strong. Oh,
[10:08] he never promised that the cross would
[10:12] not get heavy and the hill would not be
[10:16] hard to climb.
[10:21] Oh, he never offered
[10:24] our victories without fighting. But he
[10:28] said help would always come in time.
[10:34] So just remember when you're standing in
[10:38] the valley of decision
[10:41] and the adversary says give in. Just
[10:48] hold on.
[10:51] My Lord will show up.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; Yes. And he will take you through the
[10:57] fire again.
[11:03] I know within myself that I would surely
[11:08] perish. Oh, but if I trust the mighty
[11:11] hand of God, he'll shield the flames
[11:14] again.
[11:17] again.
[11:22] He never promised that the cross would
[11:26] not get heavy and the hill would not be
[11:30] hard to climb.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; He never offered our victories without
[11:40] fighting, but he said help would come
[11:44] in. So saints when yours
[11:49] when you're standing
[11:51] in the valley of decision
[11:55] and the adversary
[11:57] he says just give it
[12:01] [Music]
[12:04] our Lord will show up
[12:07] &gt;&gt; and he will take you through the fire.
[12:11] Can you help us sing this morning,
[12:13] saints?
[12:16] &gt;&gt; He never promised that the cross would
[12:19] not get heavy and the hill would not be
[12:24] hard to climb.
[12:27] Oh,
[12:29] he never offered
[12:32] a victory without fighting. But he said
[12:35] help would always come in time.
[12:39] [Music]
[12:42] Just remember when you're standing in
[12:45] the valley of decision
[12:48] and the adversary says give in
[12:54] just
[12:58] our Lord will show up
[13:01] &gt;&gt; and he will take you through the fire.
[13:07] [Music]
[13:10] He never promised that the cross would
[13:13] not get heavy and the hill would not be
[13:17] hard to
[13:21] [Music]
[13:23] &gt;&gt; He never offered
[13:26] our victories without fighting. But he
[13:29] said help would always come in time.
[13:35] So just remember when you're standing in
[13:39] the valley of decision
[13:42] and the adversary says give
[13:51] our Lord will show up
[13:55] &gt;&gt; and he will take you through the fire.
[13:59] Say one more time.
[14:03] He never promised that the cross would
[14:07] not get heavy and the hill would not be
[14:11] hard to ride.
[14:14] [Music]
[14:16] He never offered our victories without
[14:21] fighting. But he said help would always
[14:24] come in time.
[14:29] Just remember when you're standing in
[14:32] the valley of decision
[14:36] and the adversary says give
[14:41] just
[14:45] our Lord will show up this and he will
[14:49] take you through the fire again. So just
[14:54] remember,
[14:56] just remember when you're standing in
[14:59] the valley of decision
[15:02] and the adversary says give
[15:08] justice for us.
[15:12] My Lord will show up
[15:15] &gt;&gt; and he will take you through the fire
[15:19] again.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; Just hold on. Just hold on.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; Hold on. My Lord will show up.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; And he will take you through the fire
[15:32] again.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; Hold on.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Hold on. My Lord will show up.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; And he will take you through the fire.
[15:47] [Music]
[15:56] Hallelujah.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; Man, you might have a trial you're going
[16:03] through this morning. Amen. The Lord's
[16:06] here to meet your need. Amen. We got
[16:09] some requests here this morning. We want
[16:11] to take before the Lord. I'm going to
[16:12] ask brother Dier if he'd come and take
[16:15] these requests before the Lord. We don't
[16:18] remember our brother Daryl Drake. He's
[16:20] been in a hospital since Friday
[16:22] afternoon undergoing tests and so far
[16:25] all the tests are negative or normal
[16:28] except he's got elevated sugar levels in
[16:30] his blood and he's uh being transferred
[16:33] to Children's Hospital on Monday for
[16:35] more tests and they believe he's become
[16:37] a diabetic. Amen. And we want to stand
[16:40] with the Drake family. Amen. And say we
[16:44] got the victory this morning. Amen. who
[16:46] want to stand against this thing. Amen.
[16:50] We got a testimony from Sister Amelia.
[16:52] Wants to thank God and all the church,
[16:54] Brother Tom, Brother John for praying
[16:56] for my son Dario. He has a test and the
[16:59] cancer's gone. Amen. Praise God.
[17:06] Hallelujah.
[17:08] Amen.
[17:11] The Hoverer sisters want us to pray for
[17:14] their brother and uh he needs
[17:17] deliverance.
[17:19] Amen. So want to join our hearts with
[17:22] them this morning. If you've got a need
[17:24] this morning, you just lift it before
[17:26] the Lord as we go to prayer. If you're
[17:27] listening on the internet, man, and
[17:29] you've got a need this morning, amen,
[17:32] you feel like you're in the fire, the
[17:33] Lord's there with you. Amen. And and he
[17:36] knows every need, amen, this morning. So
[17:40] and ask brother Dia if you'd come and
[17:41] open the service in prayer.
[17:50] Father, we thank you this morning.
[17:55] How we appreciate your grace in our
[17:57] lives, oh God.
[17:59] How grateful we are to you, the living
[18:02] God.
[18:04] for you thought of us and you considered
[18:06] us in this hour, Father,
[18:09] to come and make yourself known and come
[18:11] and open our eyes,
[18:13] allowing us to see this bright shining
[18:15] light, your very own revelation, oh God,
[18:19] that we can, Father, realize that we
[18:22] came from you and here we are being made
[18:25] ready to go back to where we belong.
[18:27] Father,
[18:28] &gt;&gt; you have secured our victory. Oh Lord
[18:30] Jesus, you wrote it in your very own
[18:33] blood. Father, when dare you drop even
[18:35] that very last drop, you said it was
[18:38] finished, oh God, to give us the
[18:40] assurance this morning that there's
[18:42] nothing that is written against us,
[18:44] Father. You banish the ordinances, oh
[18:47] God, that was written, Father, against
[18:49] us this morning, that we can come in
[18:52] liberty, Father. We can come in freedom,
[18:55] oh God. We can come to sing and to
[18:57] celebrate this mighty victory that is
[19:00] belonging to us. That is becoming real
[19:03] every day. Father, that is becoming such
[19:06] a personal thing in our lives that we
[19:08] know the enemy is nothing but a bluff
[19:10] this morning that the children of God
[19:12] have overcome by the blood of the lamb
[19:15] and by the testimony of our mouth this
[19:18] morning. We're testifying that we're
[19:20] more than able by what you have done for
[19:22] us. Father, we can stand here, oh God,
[19:25] redeemed, Lord, knowing that you have
[19:27] sent us, Father, through the fire, but
[19:30] you have allowed us to see your mighty
[19:32] hand, your hands of deliverance, your
[19:35] hand of power, Father. So, we are
[19:37] thanking you this morning, Lord. We're
[19:39] coming to celebrate your grace, to
[19:41] celebrate this victory. Father, we're
[19:44] just so glad to know that you made this
[19:46] thing so sure and secure that there's no
[19:49] doubt in our minds this morning that
[19:51] you're more than able, Father, to meet
[19:53] every need, to touch every life. Oh God,
[19:57] we come believing, Father, we can go
[19:59] back rejoicing, oh Father, come among us
[20:03] this day and minister to every need.
[20:06] Remember, Father, the burden that we're
[20:08] carrying, for you are more than enough
[20:10] to us. You are the great Jehovah Jara.
[20:13] You have already made provision. Father,
[20:16] if we can but believe this morning, we
[20:19] can go out rejoicing, Father, knowing
[20:21] that all things is well. Our God has
[20:24] given unto us even exceedingly beyond
[20:27] all we can think of as this morning,
[20:29] Lord. Father, we're remembering the
[20:31] needy one this morning. Our brother Dar
[20:33] Father, we know this is nothing but the
[20:35] enemy, but we're claiming total victory
[20:38] this morning, Father. Come, oh Jesus,
[20:41] and touch him in such a way that a
[20:43] testimony will come back even as you did
[20:45] with sister Amelia's son, riding him of
[20:49] that cancer, oh God, that it is nothing
[20:51] to you, oh God. We curse that enemy this
[20:54] morning. We ask for total deliverance
[20:56] and that your name can be glorified as
[20:59] the testimony comes back in the house of
[21:01] God. We claim that this morning. We
[21:04] receive it, Father, and we thank you in
[21:06] advance, Lord, that it's already been
[21:08] done. And that your name, oh God, is
[21:10] that strong tower where we can go and
[21:13] find safety and refuge this morning.
[21:15] Have your way, Father. Bless the
[21:17] gathering this morning. Remember your
[21:19] servant, our pastor, as he's coming to
[21:22] stand at his post of duty, Lord. Anoint
[21:25] the man of God. Let the human element be
[21:28] moved out of the way that a divine
[21:30] channel can be open and revelation can
[21:32] be imparted to us this morning. We want
[21:35] to hear from heaven, Lord. And we know
[21:37] as we've gathered this place, we believe
[21:39] your presence is here to do all that our
[21:42] hearts are longing for. It's you that we
[21:45] want to see, Lord. Make yourself known
[21:47] once again. Come and anoint us, Father,
[21:50] to receive that hidden mana and to be
[21:53] strengthened in the inner man. We love
[21:55] you this morning, Lord. We just bless
[21:58] your great name. We appreciate this
[22:00] privilege of standing in your presence,
[22:02] Lord. We ask that you have your
[22:04] preeminence. You lead in all things,
[22:06] Lord, and that you glorify your name
[22:08] once again, by doing the supernatural
[22:11] among us, Lord. This is your gathering,
[22:13] Father. You say that the gathering of
[22:15] the people will be unto you. So, we
[22:18] commit the service under your great hand
[22:20] and asking that you have your way in
[22:23] Jesus name. We thank you father. Amen.
[22:31] &gt;&gt; You can have your seats.
[22:47] Want
[22:54] to welcome everyone this morning. Happy
[22:55] to have each and every one of you here.
[22:57] And uh those that are visiting with us,
[22:59] we just want to extend a real warm
[23:01] welcome to you. Uh the choir is going to
[23:03] sing for us this morning. Uh so if they
[23:06] would come and uh and uh get ready. We
[23:10] have one announcement this morning or
[23:12] two. Um we are happy to announce that we

[24:56] Now, do you remember
[25:00] way back
[25:02] to your former
[25:06] [Music]
[25:07] where you
[25:10] Yes, you did. You stood in position
[25:16] having dominion and all things under
[25:20] your feet.
[25:22] Oh, but you fell.
[25:26] Yes, you did. You fell from that
[25:30] fellowship
[25:32] and then you wonder where you went.
[25:39] So you thirst and you cry and you pray.
[25:44] You thirst for that latter rain and then
[25:49] you'll fight for that power again.
[25:56] You see the palmer worm came in your
[26:00] life and
[26:02] &gt;&gt; then the can worm
[26:05] &gt;&gt; came in your life and
[26:09] &gt;&gt; then the caterpillar and
[26:14] God promised
[26:17] he promised
[26:19] &gt;&gt; I will restore
[26:21] [Music]
[26:23] the Lord

[26:27] &gt;&gt; It's a
[26:28] [Music]
[26:30] we take you and hope.
[26:33] It's a Holy Ghost promise.

[26:39] &gt;&gt; I will restore
[26:41] the Lord.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Blessed the Lord. I will restore
[26:47] the Lord.
[26:50] Now power
[26:55] shall come from on high.
[26:59] After the Holy Ghost it comes upon you
[27:04] and you shall be witnesses.
[27:09] Yes, you are. Unto me throughout this
[27:13] world all my glory.
[27:17] All men shall behold.
[27:20] For I shall come.
[27:26] Unto you as the former rain and at the
[27:31] latter rain. To you shall I come. And
[27:36] all men shall testify
[27:41] that you have the evidence.
[27:45] Oh, that Jesus, he rose from the dead.
[27:53] And in your own atmosphere,
[27:57] your
[27:59] &gt;&gt; God will visit you there.
[28:04] You there
[28:05] &gt;&gt; for you were raised to be a mighty

[34:59] [Music]
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[35:03] That's our desire. Amen.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; I'll I'll have you just take your seats
[35:08] for a few moments before we we reading
[35:11] the scriptures.
[35:14] Uh we want to remember our brother uh
[35:17] Leon and brother Don de Ga. Uh also
[35:20] brother Allan who most of us know and
[35:24] sister Stephanie their mother
[35:27] uh it is the Alan and Dawn and Leon's
[35:32] stepfather passed away yesterday and so
[35:36] they have gone to be uh with their
[35:39] mother in Toronto and uh the the
[35:43] gathering of the families today he was
[35:46] Jewish Gerald Cohen and they they have a
[35:51] they have a burial almost immediately
[35:54] after the person has passed away within
[35:56] a number of hours. So that is taking
[35:59] place today. So I would ask the
[36:02] congregation we have already had prayer
[36:05] for them. we have spoken and prayed with
[36:07] Sister Stephanie last night and uh so a
[36:12] lot of you sisters are very close to
[36:14] Sister Stephanie and I I couldn't help
[36:16] but think and in connection perhaps with
[36:18] the message this morning how marvelous
[36:21] it was that uh many here know the
[36:26] testimony but I'll just be very brief
[36:28] with it. Here's brother Leon, a young
[36:31] man
[36:32] uh wanting to see the world, wanting to
[36:35] travel, fine, handsome young fellow. And
[36:39] uh so he travels from South South Africa
[36:42] to Europe and he tours Europe. And while
[36:45] he's in Europe, he sees uh uh some kind
[36:50] of a notice in the media that the that
[36:54] uh Oh, I know. I'm sorry. First he
[36:56] thought, well, I'll I'll I'll extend my
[36:59] vacation. I'll go and travel across
[37:01] America.
[37:03] And dur and in this time he's in Los
[37:06] Angeles. And while he's in Los Angeles,
[37:09] he picks up a newspaper and sees that
[37:12] the World Council of Churches is having
[37:16] uh which they only have once every six
[37:18] years is having their uh conference in
[37:23] Vancouver. and that there will be 3,000
[37:26] delegates and besides 3,000 delegates
[37:29] will be uh thousands more of visitors
[37:33] and people who will be attending and all
[37:36] kinds of groups are invited of these
[37:39] delegates. Even the Palestinians had a
[37:42] they had a a a table or a booth there.
[37:46] And then there were workshops and
[37:48] meetings of all kinds and then uh great
[37:52] gatherings of meetings and world leaders
[37:55] that were speaking. And so Leon thought,
[37:59] "Wow, this is going to be quite an
[38:01] event." And he always had some kind of,
[38:04] you know, spiritual craving that he
[38:06] couldn't explain. I'll go there. This
[38:08] this must be something only happens once
[38:10] every six years. And he does. He comes
[38:14] and he's wandering around amongst all
[38:16] these thousands of people. And there was
[38:18] about somewhere between 40 and 50 of the
[38:22] congregation here and the brothers that
[38:24] were burdened to do something. And we
[38:27] always tried to attend some of these
[38:29] significant gatherings. When Billy
[38:31] Graham was here, we did. When the Pope
[38:33] was here, brothers from the church did
[38:36] till the police stopped them. if you can
[38:38] believe it. And uh so there they were,
[38:40] 40, 50 of the brothers handing out
[38:43] message books and so on. And everybody
[38:45] who are delegates, they were given big
[38:48] bags because everyone had something to
[38:51] give out. So they had these big bags and
[38:53] they just open their shopping bag up and
[38:56] we could deposit a book in it. And who
[38:59] knows what country they went to.
[39:01] Hundreds of countries. And uh but Leon
[39:04] was one of those. He was standing there
[39:06] like a little lost sheep and uh the
[39:10] brothers got a hold of him and I think
[39:12] then he came to live with brother Milo
[39:14] for a number of weeks and he stayed here
[39:17] for some months. His vacation ended but
[39:20] his real vacation started.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh brother Leon has been with
[39:26] us ever since. And then he got burdened
[39:27] for his family and he went home. His
[39:30] mother gave her heart to Christ, came to
[39:33] the knowledge of the message, became a
[39:34] part of brother Billy Ratif's church,
[39:37] and uh Don gave his life to Christ,
[39:39] Allan gave his life to Christ, and
[39:42] they're working on one more brother. So,
[39:44] uh it's wonderful how God does things,
[39:46] isn't it? We're so thankful for that.
[39:51] Uh
[39:53] we're going to need uh some volunteer
[39:56] help. And uh this is starting from
[40:01] tomorrow morning, Monday the 19th on
[40:04] through to December 30th. Now, we know
[40:07] that no one can volunteer for that
[40:09] period of time, but uh we need some
[40:12] brothers. Uh we'll only need three at a
[40:15] time, but we would like as many brothers
[40:18] as would be available that could make
[40:21] themselves available a day or a couple
[40:23] of days between now and the end of the
[40:25] year. If you would please meet Brother
[40:28] Chris Peterson, he will be at the at the
[40:31] office and just to take your name and
[40:33] when you might or be be available and he
[40:36] could call on you and they want to draw
[40:38] draw up a schedule. Uh there it's just
[40:41] some labor work and that we have to uh
[40:45] do some uh work at the camp which we
[40:47] knew we had to do having to do with the
[40:50] septic systems etc. But we've got the uh
[40:53] the people there and they have the
[40:54] equipment etc. But we just need some we
[40:58] don't it doesn't require a lot of skill.
[41:02] Uh but uh uh you may gain some skills
[41:06] and then we could use you more.
[41:10] And if you're not in shape, if you say,
[41:11] "Well, I'm not really in shape." This
[41:14] will help you. You will get in shape. uh
[41:18] you will be fed the pay according to
[41:21] brother Chris unfortunately you won't
[41:24] receive any earthly remuneration but
[41:26] eternal benefits are great
[41:29] &gt;&gt; and they're available from our ultimate
[41:31] employer
[41:33] have openings for three people but we
[41:36] don't want just three to show up because
[41:38] we need to schedule some along the way
[41:41] and great opportunity for advancement
[41:43] into other volunteer construction
[41:46] project based on performance.
[41:52] So, Brother Chris, I hope that you are
[41:54] inundated with manpower.
[41:58] Amen. And uh for those that are on this
[42:01] side of the border, uh arrangements are
[42:04] being made so that uh even those that
[42:07] are more skilled will be able to assist
[42:10] down there.
[42:12] Amen.
[42:14] Isn't the Lord wonderful? We're just
[42:16] going to see how the service goes this
[42:18] this morning. And uh I have a a a video
[42:22] of the Congo. It's only 13 minutes, but
[42:24] I'm not going to show it before the
[42:27] word. We will just see how the service
[42:29] goes. And uh if we don't have time this
[42:32] morning, perhaps this evening after the
[42:35] service, we can show it. Uh
[42:39] those of you that were not able to be in
[42:41] the service when brother Murphy uh
[42:45] spoke, it was un unfortunate. I know
[42:47] that many were feeling, well, we'll
[42:49] stream. We'll be at home and stream, but
[42:51] it was a service we didn't stream for
[42:53] obvious reasons. And uh
[42:57] uh that's that's all we could do. We
[43:00] just couldn't stream that service. So uh
[43:03] we apologize. And yet we can't really
[43:06] fully apologize. There are things that
[43:07] we have to do and take uh take certain
[43:10] measures. Amen. Well, I would like to
[43:15] ask you to stand once again if you
[43:16] would. And let's sing we place thee in
[43:19] the highest place. Thanks, brother Ryan.
[43:23] I'd like you also if you'd remember uh
[43:26] remember I and my wife, my wife and I
[43:30] and uh actually our daughters are going
[43:32] to attend with us to brother Donnie
[43:35] Reagan's and I'm to speak the uh
[43:38] Thanksgiving meetings there. And I'd
[43:41] just like to say to the congregation
[43:43] here,
[43:44] I'm very very thankful to be alive. I'm
[43:49] thankful to be able to once more
[43:50] proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ. I'm
[43:55] glad that God gives us the strength and
[43:57] has given us the revelation of his word
[44:01] that is to me so priceless and becomes
[44:04] more priceless. And as I move through
[44:06] the service this morning, I would like
[44:08] to ask God to give you
[44:12] just a a a sense of what's on my own
[44:15] heart because I believe we're in a great
[44:17] time. We are in a great time. We're in a
[44:20] a marvelous day. And you're not here by
[44:23] accident. You didn't come into the
[44:26] message, you know, by a fluke of some
[44:28] kind. You came in by design. You believe
[44:32] that? came in by absolute design. And so
[44:36] we want the one who designed all of
[44:38] these things to move us in the direction
[44:42] that he would have us to be moved. Amen.
[44:47] We place in the highest place.
[44:51] We place you
[44:55] in the highest place
[45:00] for you.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; You alone Lord are the great highest.
[45:09] We praise you.
[45:12] [Music]
[45:17] All
[45:26] and we come to you
[45:30] and we worship
[45:34] [Music]
[45:40] &gt;&gt; once again we
[45:45] place you in the highest.
[45:48] Oh God, we look for you
[45:54] on a great high
[45:58] and we praise you.
[46:01] [Music]
[46:03] I above
[46:05] all
[46:07] else.
[46:10] High above all
[46:12] [Music]
[46:15] and we come to you.
[46:19] We worship
[46:22] at your feet.
[46:30] Let's just look to him with our hearts
[46:32] lifted up and open.
[46:35] But as we come to the word
[46:37] and those things that are on your heart,
[46:40] he sees and knows.
[46:43] Father, once again
[46:46] we add our prayer to the prayer brother
[46:48] Dier prayed and to the prayers that were
[46:52] lifted up from not only this
[46:54] congregation that is visible but that
[46:57] congregation which is part of your body
[46:59] Lord that even at this moment their
[47:02] hearts are tied and linked to our hearts
[47:05] via the internet. I pray, oh God, you'll
[47:08] see the burdens that we have and the
[47:11] praises that we have and the worship
[47:13] that we have and the victory that we're
[47:15] rejoicing in. Oh God, we do pray for
[47:18] brother Leon, Brother Don, and Sister
[47:21] Stephanie, their mother, Brother Allan,
[47:24] and those, oh God, who have a sense of
[47:27] loss and a sense of grief, but yet we
[47:29] know that you are the comforter and
[47:31] you're the lifter up of our head. And I
[47:34] pray Lord you lift up their hearts today
[47:37] father as they are together. I ask Lord
[47:39] that there will be such a supernatural
[47:43] visitation and such a virtue that will
[47:47] be poured into them. Grace upon grace
[47:50] upon grace. And I pray father that a
[47:53] supernatural measure will be their
[47:54] portion. We're thinking of uh Sister
[47:58] Rebecca and brother Tony, sister
[48:00] Rebecca's sister Shirley, her husband is
[48:03] in need. A great burden, Lord, for an
[48:07] and Ba. Lord, I pray for brother Ba
[48:11] who's not feeling all that well either.
[48:14] Strengthen him, I pray in the name of
[48:16] Jesus Christ, we have this right. And I
[48:19] pray Lord you'll give supernatural
[48:21] strength to my sister Anne. And father
[48:23] oh God at this moment that they might
[48:25] know that when they pray you hear. And
[48:28] when you hear you answer Lord I pray for
[48:32] Shirley's husband Lauren in the state
[48:35] that he's in. And even at this moment
[48:38] Lord as critical as it might be to
[48:40] humans yet we put everything into your
[48:42] hands into your care and into your
[48:45] keeping. And we can say this with
[48:47] assurance. Thou doest all things well.
[48:50] And we say yay and amen to that
[48:52] scripture. You do all things well, oh
[48:56] God. Giver of every good gift. I pray
[48:59] you'll give us a measure now of the Holy
[49:01] Spirit, Lord. Something that is even
[49:03] beyond what we think we can contain. May
[49:06] it just uh may it just possess us so
[49:08] completely. I pray, Father, in the name
[49:11] of Jesus Christ, you'll drive back the
[49:13] forces of the enemy. And may all
[49:15] darkness and doubt disappear. May it
[49:18] dissipate. I pray you'll bring every
[49:20] human spirit into subjection to the Holy
[49:23] Spirit and take every thought, oh God,
[49:26] bringing into captivity to the mind of
[49:29] Christ. In Jesus Christ's name, I pray
[49:32] you'll give, oh God, utterance for my
[49:35] lips today to speak what you have said
[49:38] for your glory. Amen.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Please take your
[49:43] Bibles if you would
[49:46] and I would like you to turn to uh
[49:48] Revelation the 3 chapter
[49:54] and we're going to start at verse 7.
[50:12] And to the angel of the church in
[50:14] Philadelphia, write these things saith
[50:18] he that is holy, he that is true. He
[50:22] that hath the key of David. He that
[50:25] openeth and no man shutth and shutth and
[50:28] no man openeth. I know thy works.
[50:31] Behold, I have set before thee an open
[50:34] door, and no man can shut it. For thou
[50:39] hast a little strength, and hast kept my
[50:42] word, and hast not denied my name.
[50:45] Behold, I will make them of the
[50:47] synagogue of Satan, which say they are
[50:51] Jews, and are not, but do lie. Behold, I
[50:54] will make them to come and worship
[50:56] before thy feet, and to know that I have
[50:59] loved thee. Because thou hast kept the
[51:03] word of my patience, I also will keep
[51:06] thee from the hour of temptation, which
[51:08] shall come upon all the world to try
[51:10] them that dwell upon the earth. Behold,
[51:14] I come quickly, and hold fast uh hold
[51:18] fast which thou hast that no man take
[51:21] thy crown. Him that overcomemeth will I
[51:25] make a pillar in the temple of my God,
[51:28] and he shall go no more out, and I will
[51:30] write upon him the name of my God, and
[51:33] the name of the city of my God, which is
[51:36] New Jerusalem, which cometh down out of
[51:39] heaven from God, from my God. And I will
[51:43] write upon him my new name. He that hath
[51:46] an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
[51:50] uh saith unto the churches. I read one
[51:53] more scripture please in 1 Corinthians
[51:56] the 16th chapter
[51:59] which is the last chapter of that book
[52:04] in just verse 9
[52:11] apostle Paul is concluding some
[52:14] instruction
[52:16] and he says for a great door and
[52:19] effectual is opened unto
[52:22] And there are many adversaries.
[52:25] I like you to notice it's a great door.
[52:31] It's effectual
[52:33] and are many adversaries. And whatever
[52:36] door God opens for you, it's a great
[52:38] door in that it's a supernatural
[52:41] opening. That's what makes it great.
[52:43] It's supernatural. It's not something
[52:45] you did. It's a great door. It is an
[52:48] opening. And thirdly, it will be uh
[52:51] secondly, it will be effectual.
[52:54] It will be effective.
[52:56] And thirdly, there will be adversaries.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated.
[53:05] I'll need your undivided attention,
[53:08] which I thank you for meeting from
[53:10] meeting, but there are some times when
[53:13] you just don't want anything to escape
[53:16] the people. So if we could have just as
[53:18] little movement as possible once you get
[53:20] settled
[53:24] and the scripture which we read as you
[53:28] uh that are familiar with the message
[53:30] are well acquainted that the
[53:32] Philadelphiaian church age brother
[53:34] Brandham said was the age of brotherly
[53:36] love and also the age of the open door.
[53:41] It was the age of a great missionary
[53:44] effort. And so I want to I want to make
[53:48] quite a few references, excuse me, to
[53:51] that age. But you must not think, oh,
[53:54] that's just the last age and has no
[53:56] reference to us. Because in the
[53:59] Philadelphia church age in the church
[54:01] age book and I will be taking quite a
[54:03] number of quotes both out of the church
[54:05] age book and also to the Philadelphiaian
[54:07] the revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[54:10] church ages be and and uh uh because he
[54:13] made certain statements there that are
[54:16] very very uh very powerful and pertinent
[54:18] to us right now and to this church. So
[54:22] he said, "I have set before thee an open
[54:25] door." Said, "I want to look at these
[54:29] words again." See, he'd referred to them
[54:32] before. I want to look at these words
[54:34] again. This time, though I though I am
[54:39] not going to disassociate them from
[54:41] missions, I'm going to bring you a
[54:44] thought which carries deep into the last
[54:48] stage. Now, that's a key phrase for me.
[54:52] I'm going to look at these words. I I
[54:55] placed before you. I put set before you
[54:57] an open door which was distinctly God's
[55:02] u message from the Lord Jesus Christ to
[55:05] the messenger of the last age. But he
[55:08] said, I want to look at this uh these
[55:11] words again. And he said, I'm not going
[55:14] to disassociate
[55:16] those words I set before you an open
[55:18] door. I'm not going to disassociate
[55:19] those from missions
[55:22] from missions but I'm going to bring you
[55:25] a thought which carries deep into the
[55:28] last age so it carries forward deep into
[55:31] this age and that's why we need to uh
[55:35] look at it very prayerfully this morning
[55:37] and he went on to say as I have already
[55:40] stated this age now I'm coming to a
[55:43] major principle here a major thought
[55:45] that brother bring brother Brandham
[55:47] brings in as I've already stated this
[55:50] age which was speaking Philadelphiaian
[55:52] age melts into melts into the last age.
[55:58] It was this age Jesus said I come
[56:01] quickly and to the last age he was going
[56:05] to finish the work and cut it short in
[56:08] righteousness because a short work will
[56:11] the Lord make upon the earth. according
[56:13] to Romans 9:28 said notice how this
[56:17] verse of Revelations 3:8 goes
[56:21] open door
[56:23] little strength
[56:25] and name. He said the open door has to
[56:30] do with all three. So the open door now
[56:33] he's tied that directly to the last
[56:36] church age. He said and this one melts
[56:39] into this one. He uses the phrase
[56:42] lapping over and he used that of all the
[56:44] ages. One laps over and kind of feathers
[56:47] off into the other, fades into the
[56:49] other. And of course, we have that with
[56:52] we're not uh unfamiliar with that in in
[56:56] uh in the realm and the area of shall we
[57:00] say technology and inventions and things
[57:03] that have happened. You'll see why I'm
[57:05] saying this at this point in just a few
[57:07] moments. But things in the world because
[57:10] as knowledge has increased and knowledge
[57:13] has been gained, you'll find that one uh
[57:17] one type of invention just doesn't just
[57:20] pass off the scene just cut off like
[57:22] that and something absolutely new just
[57:25] comes. It is one increases into the
[57:27] other.
[57:29] You understand
[57:30] the the technology we have of this
[57:32] generation, you know, something is
[57:34] introduced and it's introduced in a very
[57:36] primitive way and then as as knowledge
[57:39] is gained and it's refined and and
[57:42] increased and all and and finally you
[57:44] have some some you know uh uh shall I
[57:47] say magnificently example of what
[57:50] started maybe a few years ago. Well, in
[57:53] the church age, you find it's the same
[57:55] thing. And that the door, the open door
[57:58] has to do with all three of the open
[58:01] door, a little strength. The open door
[58:05] with a little strength, the word and the
[58:08] name, all three.
[58:11] Now just to digress from that for a
[58:13] moment. In the world there is really
[58:16] only two powers
[58:18] in the message of the uh greatest battle
[58:21] ever fought. And these are just selected
[58:24] phrases out of out of a paragraph there.
[58:28] He said there's only two powers in the
[58:30] universe. There's only two powers and
[58:33] there's only two kingdoms.
[58:35] All the rest of the little minor things
[58:38] are connected with either one of these
[58:40] two powers.
[58:42] Every war,
[58:44] every disorder,
[58:46] everything that comes along is either
[58:48] controlled by God's power or Satan's
[58:52] power. And that is the power of life and
[58:56] the power of death. I need to make that
[58:58] statement because I want to build on
[59:02] this fact of these two kingdoms in the
[59:05] sense that we are living in both at the
[59:07] same time.
[59:10] The countdown in the message of
[59:12] countdown, brother Brandham records
[59:16] spiritual advancement.
[59:18] This is a key thought. Now he connects
[59:22] spiritual advancement
[59:24] moving in concert with
[59:27] scientific advancement.
[59:30] We've gone from the horse and buggy to
[59:32] the rocket or the spaceship or whatever
[59:36] more over men in space. And while that
[59:38] was happening, the gospel also was
[59:41] advancing. And he said, why asked one
[59:44] place, why didn't this invention happen
[59:46] many centuries ago? He said they
[59:48] wouldn't have believed it back then.
[59:50] Right?
[59:51] &gt;&gt; See, and then why didn't God reveal the
[59:53] things that are revealed to you now way
[59:56] back in Luther's age? It wasn't for that
[59:59] age. And the people wouldn't, unless the
[1:00:01] people had uh unless God had ordained
[1:00:04] that there would be a people that could
[1:00:06] be illuminated at that level, they
[1:00:08] wouldn't have believed it back then.
[1:00:11] And you wouldn't have believed the
[1:00:13] messenger. You would not have believed
[1:00:15] Luther if you if you had the calling you
[1:00:18] have now. Luther said terrible things
[1:00:21] about the Jews. Smoked a pipe and drank
[1:00:25] beer.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; And I just don't think you'd be
[1:00:27] following that kind of a messenger.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; But the people at that time did
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; and that was for them at that time. And
[1:00:35] yet he was a great messenger from God.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; And the rest of it you leave to God.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; You follow that? And so in the in the
[1:00:45] message things are to be
[1:00:48] the prophet said now in this world that
[1:00:51] we live in its education,
[1:00:55] its science, civilization,
[1:00:59] all of these things that we so seemingly
[1:01:02] enjoy and we do enjoy them. You enjoy
[1:01:06] the vehicle you drive perhaps. I expect
[1:01:08] you do the home that you live in and the
[1:01:11] conveniences which we have which science
[1:01:13] has brought to us education has brought
[1:01:16] to us and the thing that the things that
[1:01:18] you do know you're glad that you know
[1:01:20] you don't want to know less in this day
[1:01:23] what you've achieved what you've learned
[1:01:25] and what man has passed on down through
[1:01:28] the centuries to us we don't want less
[1:01:31] we're happy we have what we have but
[1:01:33] these two kingdoms are are going
[1:01:36] simultaneously in concert one with the
[1:01:39] other. And we are living in a world that
[1:01:42] has both the kingdom of God and life and
[1:01:46] the kingdom of Satan and death.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; And we are in contact with both of them.
[1:01:51] And he said these things that we so
[1:01:53] seemingly enjoy today is of Satan and
[1:01:57] will perish.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; This civilization, he goes on to say, is
[1:02:03] by Satan. And so I want you to see
[1:02:06] there's a there's a band here uh of uh
[1:02:10] of of uh of the kingdom of the world.
[1:02:13] It's the science and all of these
[1:02:16] advancements which are of Satan but it
[1:02:20] is here in this present world. And that
[1:02:22] is why Jesus said we are in the world
[1:02:25] but we are not of the world.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; You follow that of course and I need to
[1:02:31] lay this. He said Genesis 4 proves it.
[1:02:35] Cain's son started this this
[1:02:38] civilization, building cities and organs
[1:02:41] and so forth. And civilization came by
[1:02:44] knowledge. Knowledge is what the devil
[1:02:48] sold Eve in the Garden of Eden and can
[1:02:51] and caused her to transgress God's
[1:02:56] commission.
[1:02:59] The Eden that God created,
[1:03:03] the Eden that God looked upon and saw
[1:03:06] and said, "It's very good." was not this
[1:03:10] one.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; It was the one he had finished.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; And when he completed it, he looked upon
[1:03:17] that kingdom. He looked upon that realm,
[1:03:20] which was a supernaturally created
[1:03:23] realm. He and he looked on it and said,
[1:03:25] "It's very good.
[1:03:29] And that is happens to be the pattern or
[1:03:32] the example that we can look for or look
[1:03:36] at and use as an example. Now because
[1:03:40] that perfect creation was lost in the
[1:03:44] fall, hear me. Because that perfect
[1:03:47] creation was lost in the fall of man. We
[1:03:51] do not really know fully what it was
[1:03:55] really like. you would agree with me
[1:03:58] thus far. And God has given us in the
[1:04:01] last day. He's given us some special
[1:04:04] prophetic insight into some of the
[1:04:08] things that took place back there and
[1:04:12] what kind of a uh what kind of a
[1:04:14] kingdom, what kind of a uh uh uh a
[1:04:19] government administration that we are
[1:04:21] going to because we now have here heard
[1:04:25] things of of the millennium. We've heard
[1:04:27] things of Eden that we haven't heard
[1:04:29] before. H how sin came, the original sin
[1:04:33] which has given us such an insight into
[1:04:36] the sacrifice, into the blood, into the
[1:04:39] high priest uh and his office uh of what
[1:04:42] Jesus came to do. We have such insight
[1:04:45] into that and what the new Jerusalem
[1:04:47] will be like and what the millennium
[1:04:49] will be like. We we've heard those
[1:04:51] things. You hear those things. We hear
[1:04:54] of our theophony which is right near us
[1:04:58] and tying it back to Apostle Paul. If
[1:05:00] this tabernacle of this house be
[1:05:03] dissolved, we have another eternal in
[1:05:06] the heavens. What glorious truth and yet
[1:05:09] brother Brandham didn't invent those
[1:05:11] words. He simply as a prophet was
[1:05:13] directed and anointed to bring us to
[1:05:16] that word because it's for the people of
[1:05:19] this age. And that's why you didn't hear
[1:05:21] it perhaps in your previous life or when
[1:05:24] I said not previous life but your
[1:05:26] earlier life and whatever church
[1:05:28] denomination you were in.
[1:05:31] So now there's much that could be said
[1:05:35] about the order and the perfect harmony
[1:05:37] of the first Eden. Brother Brandham says
[1:05:39] in the Garden of Eden was God's economy
[1:05:43] of innocence.
[1:05:45] And that's an important statement in my
[1:05:48] service this morning.
[1:05:50] It was an age of innocence. So this
[1:05:53] economy when God looked on it and said
[1:05:56] it's very good. It was an age. It was an
[1:06:00] era of innocence,
[1:06:03] of purity,
[1:06:05] of holiness. It was just natural to be
[1:06:08] holy.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; There was no sin. And that's why it was
[1:06:13] so magnificent in its harmony because
[1:06:16] automatically fellowship was there with
[1:06:18] a holy God and a holy child, a holy son
[1:06:23] and his bride. It was a marvelous. We
[1:06:25] can't all we can do is try to imagine
[1:06:29] what that was like. But here comes a
[1:06:31] prophet. I've never heard anyone else
[1:06:32] call it an economy of innocence. An age
[1:06:36] of innocence. It's a marvelous statement
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; really when you think about it because
[1:06:43] innocence
[1:06:45] is the condition of being free from
[1:06:48] evil.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; And all you and I can do as people who
[1:06:52] were born sinners is try to imagine what
[1:06:55] that's like to be free from evil.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Never having a thought of any kind that
[1:07:02] comes and afflicts you. Never having
[1:07:05] some attitude that raises up within you.
[1:07:08] Never having a moment when your heart
[1:07:11] feels wrong about something or someone
[1:07:15] or some issue. There were no issues.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; There was no there was nothing to taint
[1:07:22] the mind. Just think the mind of of the
[1:07:26] of Adam and Eve had instant and
[1:07:28] immediate contact with God.
[1:07:33] Nothing was they never had to say
[1:07:35] forgive me father.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; They never had to give any kind of they
[1:07:40] never had a taint upon them. Oh, we can
[1:07:44] only imagine that. But how marvelous
[1:07:47] that that was the age of innocence.
[1:07:50] And so that was the only age. And to be
[1:07:53] innocent is blameless,
[1:07:56] pure,
[1:07:58] clean,
[1:08:00] faultless,
[1:08:01] guiltless,
[1:08:03] never had a thought of any guilt on
[1:08:05] their mind. Harmless,
[1:08:08] immaculate,
[1:08:10] righteous, sinless, spotless, virtuous.
[1:08:13] Now as I have given those various words
[1:08:18] which are the meaning of innocent,
[1:08:22] you have some idea then why a prophet
[1:08:25] messenger in this day came and used
[1:08:28] those same words concerning the bride of
[1:08:31] Jesus Christ that she is innocent. She's
[1:08:34] guiltless. She's spotless. She's
[1:08:37] virtuous. She's pure. She's holy because
[1:08:41] this word of God who this word of God
[1:08:43] that was disbelieved back there had to
[1:08:46] be believed again and we had to come the
[1:08:48] full cycle
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; in the message masterpiece.
[1:08:56] Now I'm moving very very carefully.
[1:09:00] He said his enemy came into this
[1:09:03] marvelous
[1:09:05] age
[1:09:07] of purity, innocence,
[1:09:10] and his enemy, God's enemy, crept in
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; and he said he came in and found this
[1:09:17] great masterpiece
[1:09:19] and by deceit he crawls under the garden
[1:09:22] wall,
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; And then he marred this beautiful
[1:09:26] masterpiece. It was he called it the
[1:09:28] masterpiece family
[1:09:31] and Satan came in and he marred it so
[1:09:34] that it fell.
[1:09:38] And the Smyrnian church age said Adam
[1:09:41] took innocence
[1:09:43] and turned it into guilt.
[1:09:47] And this one speaking of the second
[1:09:48] Adam, Jesus Christ, he took guilt
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; and turned it into righteousness.
[1:09:54] Hallelujah.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Adam took a paradise and turned it into
[1:09:59] a waste howling wilderness. But this one
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; is coming back to turn an earth
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; rocking and reeling with destruction
[1:10:09] into another Eden.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; And I guarantee you in that Eden
[1:10:14] innocence will reign once again. It'll
[1:10:17] be another age of innocence. He'll be an
[1:10:19] age of purity, holiness, righteousness
[1:10:22] where none of the past will be, the
[1:10:25] scripture says, remembered anymore.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; What a joy it is to for us to sit here
[1:10:31] and have that promise right there, not
[1:10:33] only before us, but in us.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; No more tears.
[1:10:38] Hallelujah.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; No more sorrow.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; No more aching heart.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; No more guilt.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; No nothing even rising up within.
[1:10:47] Welling up within. It's gone.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's passed.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; And to the believer, we can say the
[1:10:54] victory's already won.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; The joy bells are already ringing.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; And your faith claims the promise. Like
[1:11:02] the little child claims the ice cream
[1:11:04] cone. just promised to it. I'm going to
[1:11:07] Daddy's going to buy an ice cream cone
[1:11:09] and they're delighted with it.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, they're happy. They start clapping
[1:11:13] their hands.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; We can clap our hands. We already have
[1:11:16] this.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's already ours.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "Adam took a life of fellowship
[1:11:32] and joy with God and turned it into a
[1:11:34] desert, a spiritual dark, darkness, and
[1:11:37] brought forth all sin, moral decay,
[1:11:40] pain, and suffering and delusion and
[1:11:43] corruption and wars within the souls of
[1:11:46] man.
[1:11:48] So the first Eden had innocence
[1:11:51] and then the second Eden will have
[1:11:53] innocence restored.
[1:11:56] If we consider and think about for a
[1:11:59] moment the age that we are living in and
[1:12:03] compare it with the age of innocence,
[1:12:06] we get some idea of what crept under the
[1:12:08] garden wall.
[1:12:11] Say, well, I can scarcely compare
[1:12:15] an age of innocence. It's hard to even
[1:12:18] imagine it because of the age that we're
[1:12:21] in contact with. It's a terrible vial.
[1:12:27] We can scarcely you can scarcely a evade
[1:12:32] and ev avoid or evade.
[1:12:36] They're are going to impose it on you in
[1:12:39] the restaurant and in the malls and in
[1:12:42] the newspaper and through all sorts of
[1:12:45] media and out of the mouths of your
[1:12:47] peers whether they're women or men or
[1:12:50] children all kinds of vulgarity and
[1:12:53] innuendos and stories and whatever more
[1:12:57] and it's going to be imposed on you
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; whether you like it or not. This is the
[1:13:02] age. And so that we have a a a a
[1:13:06] twophase
[1:13:08] double kingdom. One a layered one on top
[1:13:12] of the other. We're living in this one,
[1:13:15] but there is another one. And the
[1:13:17] believer is living in that one.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Satan's kingdom.
[1:13:33] was not established immediately.
[1:13:36] But everything that we see and
[1:13:38] experience today was in Satan's evil
[1:13:42] heart and mind when he crept under the
[1:13:45] garden wall.
[1:13:47] Everything you see today was in his
[1:13:49] intention when he crept in. It didn't
[1:13:52] happen immediately in Eden, but it it
[1:13:55] had its beginnings there.
[1:13:58] What we see today had its beginnings at
[1:14:01] that time. And I can say that everything
[1:14:04] that God had in his mind when he created
[1:14:08] the perfect Eden, hear me now.
[1:14:10] Everything he had in his mind when he
[1:14:12] created that perfect Eden is still in
[1:14:15] his mind. And he will not be deterred.
[1:14:18] He will not be deterred aside. He will
[1:14:21] restore it completely. I heard the song
[1:14:23] that Sister
[1:14:26] Leslie Anne sang in the choir. I will
[1:14:30] restore. I think we could say it as a as
[1:14:33] a phrase of a faith in our heart. I will
[1:14:36] restore, sayeth the Lord. Let's say it
[1:14:38] together. I will restore, sayeth the
[1:14:40] Lord. Hallelujah. It's not Ed Biscal or
[1:14:43] you saying it. It's the Lord said it. I
[1:14:46] will restore, say the Lord. What will he
[1:14:48] restore? He'll restore that first Eden
[1:14:51] exactly as the age of innocence. It will
[1:14:53] be in all of its glory and purity. And
[1:14:56] by God's grace, we will be there.
[1:15:08] says, "And Cain,"
[1:15:10] this is how it began, "and Cain knew his
[1:15:13] wife,
[1:15:14] and she conceived and bare Enoch,
[1:15:17] and Enoch builded a city." Notice how
[1:15:20] close we have an Enoch also that was is
[1:15:25] a type of the bride, the seventh from
[1:15:27] Adam. But you'll find in Cain's lineage,
[1:15:30] there's almost duplications of the same.
[1:15:34] It still is today.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; So close.
[1:15:38] that even the elect would be deceived if
[1:15:40] it were possible.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Thank God it's not possible.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; And Cain knew his wife and bear bear
[1:15:46] Enoch. And Enoch and Enoch builded a
[1:15:51] city
[1:15:53] and called the name of the city after
[1:15:55] the name of his son Enoch.
[1:15:58] And Enoch builded a city. Here's what a
[1:16:02] city is. Now things are changing. Now
[1:16:05] I'm introducing
[1:16:07] this kingdom that we live in and that we
[1:16:11] deal with.
[1:16:14] A city in the ancient times was a a
[1:16:18] walled perhaps a a ring of houses that
[1:16:23] was joined by a wall.
[1:16:26] And the wall of course is for
[1:16:28] protection.
[1:16:29] But a city is understood as being a wall
[1:16:32] or fortified place.
[1:16:34] protecting a group of houses or other
[1:16:37] social
[1:16:38] structure,
[1:16:40] economic or political or administrative
[1:16:43] structure. Now, we have something
[1:16:46] introduced that God did not introduce.
[1:16:48] He didn't introduce a city, but Cain's
[1:16:51] son introduced a city.
[1:16:55] A city is a place that has a social
[1:16:58] development
[1:16:59] sufficient to support the population
[1:17:03] and sustained by enough uh different
[1:17:06] food resources because you get a group
[1:17:08] of people. Now there comes the
[1:17:11] responsibility of how do we care for
[1:17:13] them and and uh we have now the concerns
[1:17:16] of not just a family or perhaps a tribe
[1:17:19] of people because in ancient times you
[1:17:22] know you'd have a family and then the
[1:17:24] family would grow and it would be the
[1:17:25] extended family you'd have the seniors
[1:17:28] there and the children and the
[1:17:30] grandchildren and perhaps the great
[1:17:31] grandchildren. Finally it would get
[1:17:33] large enough. So this was almost like
[1:17:36] Abraham became regarded as a as I mean
[1:17:39] he almost had a tribe of people because
[1:17:41] he had all of his men. Remember when he
[1:17:44] armed 300 that were I believe it was 300
[1:17:47] that were uh raised up born in his own
[1:17:50] in his own household or his own
[1:17:52] encampment. So they would have
[1:17:54] encampments then it would get you know
[1:17:57] uh they would they would unify perhaps
[1:17:59] with another and finally they would get
[1:18:01] to be a city. So now as soon as you had
[1:18:04] a city then the structure a structure
[1:18:08] had to come into place. The people had
[1:18:10] to design a structure to be able to
[1:18:14] start to care for the people. And so
[1:18:17] they would need perhaps security because
[1:18:19] there would be a other one that now
[1:18:22] wants to take this one's better wells
[1:18:25] and better feeding uh places and grazing
[1:18:29] lands. And so now war is introduced. And
[1:18:34] because war is introduced, military has
[1:18:37] to be introduced and a structure to care
[1:18:40] for the people that was outside of God's
[1:18:43] original program.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; You see where I'm going?
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; There had to be something introduced to
[1:18:50] care for the people. And so the cities,
[1:18:54] the city serves as a religious center,
[1:18:57] as a cultural center, as an economic
[1:19:00] center, and a base for military. Who's
[1:19:03] going to care for us? Who's going to
[1:19:05] look after this administration? Who's
[1:19:07] going to who's going to guide it? Who's
[1:19:10] going to watch over this? And so
[1:19:11] finally, uh, cities required more and
[1:19:15] more development. And finally, there'd
[1:19:18] be nations. And that's why nations
[1:19:21] fought against nations. And that's why
[1:19:23] the scripture says they'll there's a
[1:19:26] place in the time they'll teach war no
[1:19:28] more.
[1:19:39] such as we have. And so now you have to
[1:19:42] see and then the Bible speaks of the
[1:19:45] cities of the Amorites and the cities of
[1:19:48] the Hittites. And these cities then grew
[1:19:52] to be kingdoms.
[1:19:56] And the Bible says God speaking to the
[1:19:58] woman after the fall says and and to the
[1:20:03] woman he said I will not multiply I will
[1:20:07] greatly multiply
[1:20:09] because he said to Adam and Eve be
[1:20:12] fruitful and multiply but now after the
[1:20:16] fall he said you will greatly multiply
[1:20:20] and sorrow thy sorrow and thy conception
[1:20:22] I'll multiply thy I'll multiply ly thy
[1:20:27] sorrow and thy conception, and in sorrow
[1:20:31] thou shalt bring forth children. Then it
[1:20:33] wasn't long, but into Genesis 1, Genesis
[1:20:36] 6 and1 rather, and it came to pass when
[1:20:39] men began to multiply
[1:20:42] on the face of the earth, and daughters
[1:20:45] were born unto them, and they looked
[1:20:47] upon them, and saw they were very fair.
[1:20:50] And so then there was a union between
[1:20:52] Adam's lineage and Cain's lineage. I
[1:20:56] should say Abel or Seth's lineage and
[1:20:58] and Cain's lineage and then God looked
[1:21:02] upon that. But now I just want you to
[1:21:04] see the multi multiplication
[1:21:06] and the cities and the kingdoms which
[1:21:09] had to result out of that. And we don't
[1:21:11] just want to say city, kingdom, nation.
[1:21:13] We want to think about
[1:21:16] what kind of system
[1:21:19] managed,
[1:21:21] looked after, cared for, and that the
[1:21:24] people became subjects of that system,
[1:21:29] that government system. Now, in the end
[1:21:32] time, friends, in the end time, I'm
[1:21:33] taking a quantum leap to the end time.
[1:21:36] And you have a messenger came, every
[1:21:38] government
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; is of the devil.
[1:21:43] education,
[1:21:45] science, the things that we so enjoy
[1:21:47] because it's all in this realm. It's all
[1:21:50] in this dimension that was introduced
[1:21:52] when Satan came under the garden wall.
[1:21:55] He had that plan and now it has risen to
[1:21:58] its apex, shall I say, at the end time
[1:22:02] until until even a prophet would have to
[1:22:05] come and say, "This is Satan's Eden.
[1:22:12] Whether you like it or not,
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; we seemingly enjoy some of the things.
[1:22:16] He's not saying don't enjoy it. I mean,
[1:22:19] do do the best that you can. But we we
[1:22:22] as believers must bear in mind this
[1:22:25] kingdom is designed by Satan.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; And I should have a hearty
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; amen to that.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; We work in it. We receive salaries for
[1:22:39] it.
[1:22:40] We have to live in homes. We utilize the
[1:22:43] technology. We utilize the advancement.
[1:22:47] We utilize the education. But we must
[1:22:50] not be tied to it.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; We must not have it dictate to us.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Because we are of another kingdom
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; and that kingdom is within you.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; That kingdom is a holy kingdom. It's
[1:23:03] contrary to this kingdom. And that is
[1:23:05] why the flesh is contrary to the spirit
[1:23:09] because the flesh is tied into this
[1:23:11] kingdom and the spirit is tied into
[1:23:13] another kingdom.
[1:23:19] So in questions and answers,
[1:23:24] he said, "Now
[1:23:28] those people speaking of the great signs
[1:23:30] and wonders in Israel."
[1:23:33] And then he sent men to spy out
[1:23:36] uh spy out one out of each tribe. Now we
[1:23:40] have the tribes of Israel. And Moses is
[1:23:44] now he's now uh at at Kadesh and he's
[1:23:48] sending these spies out to to see this
[1:23:52] land. And when they came back they had a
[1:23:55] bunch of grapes taken by two men. Took
[1:23:58] two men to pack it. And when they went
[1:24:01] back, instead of rejoicing, because they
[1:24:03] had a taste of the grapes, instead of
[1:24:05] that, they went back to their tribes and
[1:24:09] said, "Oh, but we have seen great walled
[1:24:15] cities
[1:24:18] of the Philistines or of the Hittites or
[1:24:22] of the Parizzites." And they said, "And
[1:24:24] they are giants and we look like
[1:24:27] grasshoppers beside them." Says they he
[1:24:31] said they went to the borderline. They
[1:24:33] were borderline believers and they came
[1:24:36] up to the real thing and saw the promise
[1:24:40] and felt that their they weren't weren't
[1:24:42] able to go over and take the promise. I
[1:24:46] said that because although that was back
[1:24:48] in Moses time that happens to be here
[1:24:51] today.
[1:24:53] November the 18th I believe
[1:24:56] 2007 is exactly the same thing for
[1:25:00] exactly the same reason. They were
[1:25:02] seeing the development of this kingdom
[1:25:05] uh of this operational kingdom that
[1:25:08] Satan was putting into place. Here we
[1:25:10] are looking back maybe 3 4 thousand
[1:25:12] years and now they were coming to a
[1:25:15] rather primitive but they saw a walled
[1:25:18] city. Men had gathered themselves into
[1:25:21] walled cities and they had they had made
[1:25:24] themselves to appear fearsome and these
[1:25:27] people had perhaps fought wars and taken
[1:25:29] lands and had slain other tribes and
[1:25:32] whatever more and now there are wall
[1:25:34] cities. Now here's God's people
[1:25:38] operating in another level having a
[1:25:41] prophet with the word coming from
[1:25:43] another dimension
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; telling them go into that land and take
[1:25:48] it. I have given it to you. But when
[1:25:51] they saw what the other kingdom had
[1:25:53] established, they became fearful.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; How many people have not received this
[1:25:59] message because they've seen their great
[1:26:01] denominational system?
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Said, "How how do we how do we do this?
[1:26:06] How how do we uh you know, I I have a
[1:26:09] certain apprehension within me because
[1:26:11] this is so well established. How many
[1:26:13] ministers saw this and and and brother
[1:26:15] Brandham even said they spoke with him.
[1:26:18] I've spoken with them. I've spoken to
[1:26:21] one that was my pastor in Toronto and I
[1:26:25] and my wife sitting in the room talking
[1:26:28] about this very message. And he was so
[1:26:31] moved in his heart. He said, "I never
[1:26:33] saw such things as I saw in brother
[1:26:35] Brandham's meetings in Windsor." And he
[1:26:37] knew it was the truth. And out of his
[1:26:39] wife's mouth and God bless her very is a
[1:26:42] woman. She's concerned about home and
[1:26:44] things. She's and his name was Edmund.
[1:26:48] Well, Edwin,
[1:26:50] remember our pension?
[1:26:54] Because they were getting up in years
[1:26:56] and they had to think about their future
[1:26:59] and the system guaranteed them their
[1:27:03] retirement
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; and they had to think about their system
[1:27:06] and had to think about their future and
[1:27:09] that bound them to it.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; And he wasn't able to listen to his
[1:27:14] heart. The grapes taste wonderful. I
[1:27:18] never saw such power. I never felt such
[1:27:22] presence. I've never seen such truth as
[1:27:25] I seen this message. But there's a fear.
[1:27:27] There's an apprehension in my heart.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; And that's the two kingdoms
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; abiding at the same time.
[1:27:41] We've seen great walled cities
[1:27:44] and they became borderline believers.
[1:27:48] Now we arrive at time
[1:27:51] when the civilization that was
[1:27:53] introduced by Satan in Eden
[1:27:56] is putting fear into their hearts. And I
[1:28:00] don't want to just say outside of this
[1:28:01] church, outside of those that are
[1:28:03] listening to the voice,
[1:28:05] but as soon as we say and we bring the
[1:28:08] things that are imposed upon us, we say,
[1:28:12] "Well, how will we live?
[1:28:15] If I listen to my heart, how will I
[1:28:17] survive?
[1:28:20] If I move there, how will I h how will I
[1:28:25] sustain myself?
[1:28:28] If I pay my tithes, how am I going to
[1:28:30] pay my bills?
[1:28:33] And things that are clearly in the word
[1:28:36] of God and but we become fearful. We
[1:28:39] become apprehensive because the system
[1:28:42] that we're living in has imposed other
[1:28:45] things upon us.
[1:28:47] Now it's quiet, but you ought to be
[1:28:48] getting more boisterous all the time.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; This world has imposed. And remember,
[1:28:55] it's not this world. It's Satan in this
[1:28:58] world.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; This is Satan's kingdom,
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Satan's Eden.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; And we stand against it with everything
[1:29:06] that's within us because we are not of
[1:29:09] this world. We're not of this kingdom.
[1:29:12] We're not part of this Eden. Thank God
[1:29:14] for that.
[1:29:17] I want to declare it.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; And yet I believe use it. Use it all you
[1:29:23] can. Use the mammon up. Use it for the
[1:29:26] kingdom of God. Use it for the
[1:29:28] betterment of your family. God bless
[1:29:30] you.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Make all you can. Give all
[1:29:35] you can.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; You're here as a instrument.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Get all you can here and pass it up into
[1:29:43] the next kingdom.
[1:29:46] Hallelujah.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; If you don't understand me, just hang on
[1:29:51] to your seats. You will in a little
[1:29:53] while.
[1:29:58] They said, "These spies said, we came to
[1:30:00] the land whether thou sentest, and
[1:30:03] surely it flowth with milk and honey,
[1:30:06] and this is the fruit of it. Surely it
[1:30:08] flows with milk and honey." this kingdom
[1:30:11] that God, these promises that God has
[1:30:13] given us flows with milk and honey. Now,
[1:30:16] many people hadn't got there yet, but
[1:30:18] they had to believe the spies. Maybe
[1:30:20] some of you folks haven't experienced,
[1:30:22] you know, uh, all the glories and the
[1:30:25] marvelous thing and say, "Oh, I wish I
[1:30:27] could have that." Well, that's fine. You
[1:30:29] just keep drudging on and you'll have
[1:30:31] it, too.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; It'll be yours as well.
[1:30:36] You keep believing the promise and
[1:30:38] you'll come to where the others have
[1:30:40] come.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe it, well, then you
[1:30:42] won't enter into it.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, the people be strong that
[1:30:50] dwell in the land and the cities are
[1:30:52] walled and very great. And moreover, we
[1:30:55] saw the children of Anch there. Sometime
[1:30:58] when we look out in the world and we see
[1:31:01] as David did. David was a marvelous king
[1:31:06] of Israel but he looked at others and he
[1:31:09] wondered how do the evil people who live
[1:31:12] so wickedly do so well. Why is it that
[1:31:16] they prosper? Why is it looks like they
[1:31:19] don't have the same problems that we
[1:31:21] have? But then he considered the end.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what you need to
[1:31:26] think about. You need to keep the end in
[1:31:29] front of you. Hallelujah. And when you
[1:31:30] look at the end, you realize they're
[1:31:32] having their best time right now and
[1:31:34] you're having your worst time right now.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. This is your worst time.
[1:31:41] It's not that bad when you think it's my
[1:31:43] worst time because I have my savior
[1:31:45] walking with me. I have the token within
[1:31:48] me. I've got the message of the hour.
[1:31:50] This is not that bad. We can survive
[1:31:53] anything. Whether it be in life or
[1:31:55] whether it be in death. Whether we live
[1:31:57] a short time or a long time. This is
[1:32:00] God's time that he put us here.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; I'm staying fairly close to my notes for
[1:32:12] a specific reason
[1:32:16] because I felt very very directed of God
[1:32:18] in this thought. I want you to hang on
[1:32:21] to it. Listen to it closely.
[1:32:26] The system
[1:32:28] necessary to operate our society
[1:32:32] is contrary
[1:32:34] to spiritual life. I want to say that
[1:32:37] again. The system that is necessary to
[1:32:40] operate our society,
[1:32:43] it is contrary to spiritual life.
[1:32:46] That is why Apostle Paul says the spirit
[1:32:51] and the the carnal man, they're at war
[1:32:54] with one another
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; because the carnal man can never please
[1:32:58] God in that sense of the world in that
[1:33:01] sense of the word. And the spirit cannot
[1:33:04] that that holy spirit within us cannot
[1:33:07] feel at home in the world that we have
[1:33:09] to live in. And so we as individuals we
[1:33:13] have this uh uh we have this what do I
[1:33:17] say this uh feeling within ourselves
[1:33:21] that is uh it it's a it's not one of
[1:33:24] complete union. We can't be in union
[1:33:27] with the world. The system for example
[1:33:30] imposes demands upon the people that
[1:33:34] often choke the life of the spiritual
[1:33:37] blessing.
[1:33:39] The whole system of civilized of
[1:33:42] civilization requires a higher level of
[1:33:45] education,
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; a higher level of skills which are not
[1:33:49] available in the wilderness.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:33:53] So that is why what we have now, you
[1:33:57] know, we've developed into cities and
[1:33:59] we've developed into nations and we've
[1:34:01] developed into all different of types of
[1:34:04] identities. But and so we require things
[1:34:08] the the organism requires things that
[1:34:11] was not required in the wilderness when
[1:34:14] we were just an encampment. If you can
[1:34:16] put yourself back say we were just an
[1:34:18] encampment of rural people. We didn't
[1:34:21] need all of these things. We didn't need
[1:34:24] to be taxed to the eyebrows to support
[1:34:27] our police and our firemen and our
[1:34:30] protection and our highway systems and
[1:34:33] all those things. I'm I'm not saying
[1:34:35] that these things are wrong. We are
[1:34:37] here. God put us in this place. But he
[1:34:40] does not want us to be so imposed that
[1:34:43] system so imposed upon us that it just
[1:34:45] chokes out the spiritual part.
[1:34:50] And I have a very specific reason for
[1:34:52] bringing this this way. Many good
[1:34:55] wholesome young people, for example,
[1:34:57] good wholesome young people that lived
[1:35:00] on the farm. And if you go to the
[1:35:02] prairies of the Midwest, you'll find
[1:35:04] that the farms are are vacated. The
[1:35:07] buildings are just being whitened with
[1:35:09] age. And the people have left the farms
[1:35:12] and have moved to the
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; cities.
[1:35:17] But when they come to the city, they
[1:35:19] have certain things imposed on them that
[1:35:22] never was out on the farm.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; If you got angry out at the farm, you
[1:35:27] might take a stick and throw it at the
[1:35:29] cow or take an old root off the ground
[1:35:33] and strike a tree and wear off your, you
[1:35:36] know, anger, but that's about all you
[1:35:38] could do. Wasn't a whole lot to do.
[1:35:42] You look lost.
[1:35:45] The reason I can preach it, so I've been
[1:35:48] there.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; I've been out in the wilderness and
[1:35:51] things may be, but there isn't very much
[1:35:52] to aggravate you.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; There's not much to trouble you out
[1:35:56] there. Not much to even get annoyed
[1:35:59] about. You know,
[1:36:02] I get upset if I needed a prairie
[1:36:04] chicken to eat and I missed him.
[1:36:08] That was about it. But I missed that
[1:36:11] shot. Missed that nice chicken.
[1:36:15] and really frustrating.
[1:36:17] Stomp your foot, hit a tree, bang your
[1:36:20] gun on the ground. But what are you
[1:36:22] going to do? But not here. Not so now. I
[1:36:26] mean, you can give a person a piece of
[1:36:27] your mind and got cut off on the highway
[1:36:30] and all the rest of it. Hey, you're
[1:36:32] paying for that highway. Might as well
[1:36:33] enjoy it.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; The only reason you're quiet is I'm
[1:36:40] coming to your address.
[1:36:43] coming right to your address
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; and I've just started
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; and turn my watch over
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; if I go to tonight. Brother Tom,
[1:36:57] many good wholesome young person went to
[1:37:00] the city. Then when they went to the
[1:37:03] city ah they become street wise.
[1:37:06] Now they knew how things worked. They
[1:37:10] went into the college and then they
[1:37:12] found all about the you know the unisex
[1:37:16] and uh the and uh how you know things
[1:37:19] aren't the way it was at home and they
[1:37:22] get a whole new a whole new education
[1:37:25] and now they know things that mother and
[1:37:28] dad didn't weren't able to teach them.
[1:37:30] They've learned a whole lot of things.
[1:37:33] But you know, in uh the final analyses
[1:37:36] of that is it didn't really do them
[1:37:39] good.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Many went there with good morals, good
[1:37:43] standards
[1:37:45] and a and a wholesome attitude and a
[1:37:48] respect for the gospel, a respect for
[1:37:51] humanity, a respect for their fellow
[1:37:53] man. And much of it they lost it all.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it's not necessary." No,
[1:37:58] that might be true. But nevertheless,
[1:38:00] that's what happened. And what I'm
[1:38:01] trying to say is that that this whole
[1:38:04] band, this whole realm, this whole
[1:38:06] system of this world is has been
[1:38:08] designed by Satan to sap that out of a
[1:38:11] person.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; And spiritual amnesia, my God, help me.
[1:38:17] I've got a ways to go. He says the
[1:38:20] church has got a bad case of spiritual
[1:38:22] amnesia.
[1:38:24] He said it's got into a place of Leodysa
[1:38:26] again, back into that rich place like
[1:38:28] Israel was when it was poor
[1:38:32] and had to trust God for everything. It
[1:38:36] could do any everything that God and he
[1:38:38] broke it. It trusted God. He said then
[1:38:41] God was with it and it was and it was
[1:38:44] spiritually moved on. Spiritually moved
[1:38:48] on. But when it got rich, here's what
[1:38:50] happened. their cities built up
[1:38:54] and their women got immoral. Notice how
[1:38:56] he puts that. When they got rich, their
[1:38:59] cities built up and their women became
[1:39:02] immoral and men permitted it and their
[1:39:05] preachers let down the bar and they
[1:39:08] denounced the prophets and that's the
[1:39:10] kind of condition they got into. You
[1:39:13] know, you ought to take that phrase.
[1:39:14] It's in spiritual amnesia. Brother
[1:39:16] Brandham wasn't just lipping off some
[1:39:18] thoughts, loose thoughts. that's somehow
[1:39:22] disjointed. This was an absolute clear
[1:39:24] pattern when they got rich. And here's
[1:39:27] what happened. Their cities built up.
[1:39:30] They got finer places and their women
[1:39:32] got immoral. That's what happens in a in
[1:39:35] the cities. And their men permitted it.
[1:39:37] And their preachers let down the bar and
[1:39:39] they denounced their prophets. That
[1:39:41] happens to be a very distinct pattern of
[1:39:44] what happens. And Satan designed it.
[1:39:51] That's precisely what he planned when he
[1:39:53] crawled under the garden wall.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; They'll become groups. They'll become
[1:39:58] tribes. They'll become cities. They'll
[1:40:00] become nations.
[1:40:03] And they'll set up a whole system and
[1:40:05] and it will be an economic system. I'm
[1:40:08] going to design it.
[1:40:11] It'll be a military system because I'm
[1:40:14] going to design it. Their protection and
[1:40:15] so on. It designed by Satan.
[1:40:23] When the fall came, and I don't want to
[1:40:24] spend much time on this, but I'll just
[1:40:27] want to mention it. when the fall first
[1:40:30] came and and Adam and Eve now had to be
[1:40:34] driven out of this
[1:40:37] place of innocence
[1:40:40] and this age of innocence. The Bible
[1:40:42] says that they put that God placed
[1:40:45] cherubams and it says that it was on the
[1:40:48] east side of Eden where he placed these
[1:40:52] cherubams and I was very very keenly
[1:40:55] interested. I don't know if I can
[1:40:57] explain it to you just right, but east
[1:41:00] in this case is not merely east as in as
[1:41:04] opposed to west. But east in the Hebrew
[1:41:07] is that which was before from the from
[1:41:11] the ancient time or a for time or
[1:41:15] before. In other words, God was going to
[1:41:18] keep it original,
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; right? He was not going to allow this
[1:41:22] word of life, this tree of life to be
[1:41:25] tampered with.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; And how in Satan's Eden today, man with
[1:41:30] his knowledge has taken this book and d
[1:41:33] this is Christ.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; This is exactly what was in the tree of
[1:41:37] in in the Eden as the tree of life. And
[1:41:40] they've tampered with it and they have
[1:41:42] modified it. And they have so changed it
[1:41:45] till you can go to a Bible bookstore and
[1:41:47] hardly recognize the words of this book.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Because they have changed it. But God
[1:41:55] God guaranteed there would be an
[1:41:57] original word.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; And he was going to put he's going to
[1:42:01] put cherubams in the four time in the
[1:42:05] ancient time to keep it as it was
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; and that less they less they would
[1:42:10] tamper with this. And it and he closed
[1:42:12] it to them. Closed the door
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; and drove them out.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; And now a prophet comes in this end time
[1:42:22] to reveal or to open up
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; that which was locked up.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; And he said today those same cherubams
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; are here now
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; to drive you back to that tree.
[1:42:41] Let's give God a praise offering.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; The same cherubam
[1:42:47] here now. Here now.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Why doesn't the congregation say same
[1:42:54] cherubam
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; here now?
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Here now
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; to drive me back
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; to the tree of life.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; That's exactly the truth of God's word.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; How could they be here now? Because now
[1:43:10] there was the original word coming back
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; to the people.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; And that is why the system, the
[1:43:19] denominational system had to reject it
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; because they could find no place to
[1:43:25] unify with it.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; It was man's system
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; designed by Satan.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; And he had that in his mind when he
[1:43:32] crawled under the garden wall.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Is it clear?
[1:43:48] Well, I think I've stayed enough along
[1:43:50] on that.
[1:43:54] Oh, he said, "Oh, come
[1:43:56] take the tree of life." Instead of those
[1:43:59] instead of those cherubams guiding this
[1:44:01] throne, they're out here seeking, trying
[1:44:06] to run the people, guard to the throne,
[1:44:09] trying to bring them through the gate.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Back to the tree of life again.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; The gate that was closed, my brother, my
[1:44:16] sister, has been unlocked.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; The door that was locked is now open.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; You don't have to try to push on it. It
[1:44:26] is open. God has opened it.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Ah, this is the day of the open door.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's open for you. All the
[1:44:36] benefits are open for you.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, come.
[1:44:44] This is Elijah saying, "Oh, come to the
[1:44:47] tree of life." What kind of invitation
[1:44:49] do we need? Do you think how many people
[1:44:52] came when Jesus said, "Come unto me all
[1:44:54] ye that are burdened and heavy laden."
[1:44:56] Do you think they came?
[1:44:59] Not many. You're sitting here today
[1:45:03] and you hear a prophet's message. Oh,
[1:45:05] come. Not just come, not come to him.
[1:45:08] Not come to his church, not come to just
[1:45:11] the way he thinks things are, but come
[1:45:13] back to the tree of life because the
[1:45:16] gate has been opened.
[1:45:21] Not only that, he described it with such
[1:45:25] magnificent language.
[1:45:27] When Adam and Eve left, you young people
[1:45:30] read literature. You've never read
[1:45:32] literature like this. Never. And he says
[1:45:35] he can see them. And as a prophet, I
[1:45:37] believe he could see them. And he says,
[1:45:39] "Now they're walking out of the garden
[1:45:42] and they've got the skins that God
[1:45:45] himself clothed them in. And the skins
[1:45:49] are slapping against the great manly
[1:45:51] legs of Adam as he walks out. that
[1:45:55] perfect physique and that beautiful
[1:45:57] woman that Eve was and and puts her head
[1:46:01] over on her husband's bosom and the
[1:46:05] tears now dropping down onto her and her
[1:46:10] tears dropping down onto her body and
[1:46:13] mingling with the blood from the skins
[1:46:17] that they've been clothed on. And a
[1:46:19] prophet describes them exiting, leaving
[1:46:22] Eden and saying
[1:46:25] they can cry now.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; God saw that.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; I've always been moved when I read that.
[1:46:36] I thought, how sad,
[1:46:39] how terribly sad that is. But I I would
[1:46:43] be very very sad if we didn't have the
[1:46:46] same one who drove them out to come and
[1:46:48] say, "I'll make all things new,
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; and there'll be no more tears.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; There'll be no more crying. There'll be
[1:46:56] no more sorrow." Why? because he knew
[1:46:59] that the same age that were standing
[1:47:01] there with a flaming sword, he would
[1:47:03] bring back a messenger with a flaming
[1:47:05] sword in his hand and break loose the
[1:47:08] door and send the people back in back to
[1:47:11] the tree of life again.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I tell you what, folks, if
[1:47:17] you're not, I trust you do enjoy it, but
[1:47:20] I'm going to enjoy this word.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; I'm going to enjoy my salvation.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely glorious.
[1:47:29] Oh, thank God for the cherubams, the
[1:47:32] angels of the Lord that are driving us
[1:47:35] back to the tree of life
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; here now.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, I say God, that your angels minister
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; faith
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; to the heart that needs faith.
[1:47:53] Another
[1:48:01] thing and I'm just dropping these in
[1:48:03] because I haven't got time to go into it
[1:48:07] but I bring this in so that you'll
[1:48:10] understand another important statement
[1:48:12] which happens to be one of the great
[1:48:14] stumbling blocks of the world in regards
[1:48:16] to the message and brother Brandham
[1:48:19] talks about one age being ushered into
[1:48:22] the other
[1:48:24] th this age is is fading out and it's
[1:48:29] lapping over this age and this age is
[1:48:32] picking up and carrying on to its new
[1:48:36] its new realm, its new uh what it is
[1:48:40] that it's supposed to or will actually
[1:48:43] bring into being. So, one age is being
[1:48:46] ushered out, the other age is being
[1:48:49] ushered in. And there is, as he said,
[1:48:52] there's no cut off date where this just
[1:48:55] ceases and then something else happens.
[1:48:58] When did the computer come? I'm going to
[1:49:00] talk about it in a moment or two. When
[1:49:02] did it come? Well, it's been coming all
[1:49:04] the time. It's been coming for a lot of
[1:49:06] years. It's it's come from, you know,
[1:49:08] some very very primitive thing to now we
[1:49:11] have it, you know, we have it on our
[1:49:13] pocket.
[1:49:16] When did this one age quit? That's why
[1:49:18] brother Brandham says the age of the
[1:49:20] open door.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; He said that promise and everything that
[1:49:24] was said there comes deep into this age.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Now he says in the church age and here's
[1:49:37] the here's the one everybody not here
[1:49:40] but all kinds of people came. They sat
[1:49:42] in my office right here in this building
[1:49:44] and says William Brham said that 1977
[1:49:51] will usher in the millennium. I said
[1:49:54] that's that's exactly what he said.
[1:49:57] And if you under understand usher in
[1:50:00] usher out, then you understand what
[1:50:03] usher in means. Amen.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; I said to him, I said, "The bride."
[1:50:07] Well, let's say we're having a wedding
[1:50:09] and and and and so someone is standing
[1:50:11] there and the bride is getting out of
[1:50:13] the car out in the parking lot and uh
[1:50:15] and a man stands up and says, "The bride
[1:50:17] is now being ushered in," which is
[1:50:19] perfectly fine. Maybe she's coming
[1:50:21] through the doors in the foyer. The
[1:50:23] bride is being ushered in. Or he's
[1:50:25] coming through the double doors here.
[1:50:27] The bride's being ushered in with an
[1:50:29] eternal God. Is that a day, a week, a
[1:50:32] month, a year, 10 years, 15 years?
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Samuel was 12 years old. Some of our
[1:50:38] people know this. I preached this at the
[1:50:40] in the log church. Samuel was 12 years
[1:50:43] old. God called him three times in the
[1:50:47] evening.
[1:50:49] And then in the morning, Eli, which was
[1:50:50] the priest, now this was a prophet, but
[1:50:53] he's just coming to be a prophet. He's
[1:50:55] just a boy about 12. So he comes and Eli
[1:50:58] knows knows what to do, you know, when
[1:51:03] God speaks, but he couldn't receive the
[1:51:04] word.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; He had no capacity to receive the word.
[1:51:08] He was now aged and his sons had become
[1:51:10] sons of bal. They' become very wicked
[1:51:12] and he hadn't he didn't have enough
[1:51:14] courage to straighten them out or to
[1:51:16] disassociate them himself from them. And
[1:51:19] so he said to Samuel in the morning,
[1:51:22] "You tell me
[1:51:24] what he said to you. And if you don't
[1:51:27] tell me, may it be worse upon you." I'm
[1:51:30] just paraphrasing it. And Samuel told
[1:51:34] him everything. Really, what he had to
[1:51:36] tell him was, "God's done with you, and
[1:51:39] God's done with this office of the
[1:51:42] priesthood, and he's going to change
[1:51:44] it." It was about 16 years or longer
[1:51:48] from that time. No, there's more. 16 I'm
[1:51:50] coming to. I think it was about 25 years
[1:51:53] that Eli then was sitting in a chair,
[1:51:55] got word that his sons had been killed
[1:51:57] in a in a war and the ark had been
[1:51:59] taken. And when the war the ark had been
[1:52:01] taken, then he fell over backwards,
[1:52:03] broke his neck and died. What was
[1:52:06] happening in that 25 years? In that 25
[1:52:08] years, the office of the priest was
[1:52:12] being ushered out
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; and the office of the prophet was being
[1:52:16] ushered in. It wasn't just cut off and
[1:52:18] start
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; in the New Testament. If you had been
[1:52:22] standing there and that's what I asked
[1:52:24] this reporter of the of the of a
[1:52:26] Christian ecumenical newspaper sat here
[1:52:27] to question me on brother Brandham's
[1:52:29] ministry and I I said to him about
[1:52:31] ushering in. I said and I went through
[1:52:33] the bride thing with him. I said now uh
[1:52:35] let's go to the scripture and you're a
[1:52:37] reporter. Now you're a reporter. You're
[1:52:39] standing there and you hear Jesus and
[1:52:41] you see him weeping over Jerusalem,
[1:52:43] standing on Mount Olives and he's
[1:52:45] weeping and he's saying, "Oh Jerusalem,
[1:52:47] Jerusalem, thou this killst the
[1:52:49] prophets. If you'd only known your day
[1:52:51] of visitation, at least this your day of
[1:52:53] visitation, but now it's gone from you.
[1:52:56] Now it's passed from you." I said, "What
[1:52:58] would you report in your newspaper?"
[1:53:00] You'd say, "Jerusalem's finished. I
[1:53:03] heard it myself. I heard it right out of
[1:53:04] the mouth of the Messiah myself. It's
[1:53:07] finished.
[1:53:08] And then comes the disciples. And then
[1:53:12] comes Jesus saying, "Try ye in the city
[1:53:16] of Jerusalem until you be endued with
[1:53:18] power from on high." And then in
[1:53:20] Jerusalem, 3,000.
[1:53:22] And these are devout Jews that came to
[1:53:25] worship there. 3,000 are converted in
[1:53:27] one day. What would you say then? This
[1:53:29] is just a couple months down the road.
[1:53:31] So now and two months down the road, it
[1:53:33] doesn't look like it's over with at all.
[1:53:35] They're having the greatest revival.
[1:53:37] They've never had anything like this.
[1:53:39] And the Holy Spirit has come. Now it's
[1:53:41] happened. I said, "Now we'll just go
[1:53:42] down about 16 years down the road." And
[1:53:45] now here's Apostle Paul, this mighty
[1:53:48] first church age messenger. And Apostle
[1:53:50] Paul comes and uh and and then he speaks
[1:53:53] to the Jews. And he says to the Jews,
[1:53:55] "It was necessary, it was needful for us
[1:53:59] to preach the gospel to you first, but
[1:54:02] seeing that you have counted yourself
[1:54:05] unworthy of eternal life, henceforth or
[1:54:08] from now on, we turn to the Gentiles."
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; I think it's the 13th chapter, 14th
[1:54:15] chapter of Acts. And then you go to the
[1:54:18] 14th chapter it is. And the Bible says,
[1:54:20] "And they journeyed to Iconium
[1:54:24] and went into the synagogue and preached
[1:54:27] there, and many devout Jews believed on
[1:54:30] them."
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; So I said to this reporter, when did it
[1:54:34] end?
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; When was God done? But I said, "One
[1:54:38] thing for sure, and I say to you today,
[1:54:41] one thing for sure, the Jewish age did
[1:54:44] fade out,
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; and the Gentile age was ushered in." And
[1:54:49] we just happen to be at the other end of
[1:54:51] the scale. The Gentile age has received
[1:54:54] a gentile messenger who said it's over.
[1:54:57] And it is indeed over and it's being
[1:54:59] ushered out. And you came in that time.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; And the Jewish age is being ushered in.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; One is being ushered out and the other
[1:55:10] is being ushered in. And exactly what he
[1:55:13] said is exactly the truth.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the people can say
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Are you rejoicing yet?
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; I want to preach you happy.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Give me a few more minutes, please.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:55:34] he said this in order to understand the
[1:55:37] wealth of meaning involved in quotation.
[1:55:42] Behold, I set before you an open door,
[1:55:46] and no man can shut it. We must recall
[1:55:51] what has been said about each age
[1:55:53] running over into another.
[1:55:56] He's coming right into this ushering in.
[1:55:58] In order to understand the wealth
[1:56:01] of behold, I set before you an open
[1:56:03] door. Now, folks, this is not a lesson.
[1:56:06] This is not just some teaching. This
[1:56:08] isn't just going back over learning
[1:56:10] something about a previous age. I'm
[1:56:12] talking to you about the very day you're
[1:56:14] in, the very seat you're sitting in.
[1:56:17] This is applicable to you this morning.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; We must now recall what has been said
[1:56:27] about each age running over into
[1:56:29] another. There is an overlapping, and
[1:56:32] that's the word he uses now, a melting
[1:56:36] or a fading into rather than an abrupt
[1:56:40] end. and a clear-cut start. This age
[1:56:44] particularly flows into the next age.
[1:56:47] The Philadelphiaian age particularly of
[1:56:50] all the ages flows into the next one
[1:56:52] which is ours. So what he's saying I
[1:56:54] want to say something of the wealth of
[1:56:57] this open door. There is a treasure.
[1:57:00] There is something special. There's
[1:57:02] something spectacular about this. I
[1:57:05] place before you an open door. And now a
[1:57:07] messenger saying that is fading into
[1:57:10] this one.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; This has special.
[1:57:16] Are you giving me your undivided
[1:57:18] attention?
[1:57:20] This has special meaning for you,
[1:57:26] for us.
[1:57:28] He says, "Not only does this age
[1:57:30] overflow into the last age, but the last
[1:57:34] age in many respects simply a carrying
[1:57:37] on of the sixth age. The seventh age is
[1:57:40] very short. Your age is very short.
[1:57:45] It gathers up into itself in one quick
[1:57:48] work all the evil of every age
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; and yet all the reality of Pentecost."
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It brings everything
[1:57:58] forward. So everything comes. This is
[1:58:02] the aggregate age. That's why it's
[1:58:04] Satan's Eden.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; And this is the aggregate, the sum total
[1:58:09] of everything that came on the day of
[1:58:12] Pentecost. Hallelujah. I thought I heard
[1:58:14] a testimony here. Somebody was prayed
[1:58:16] for for cancer and they were healed.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; That should be happening. I heard a
[1:58:20] testimony here and saw it on there and
[1:58:22] people in the congregation didn't
[1:58:24] understand the pictures we showed of
[1:58:26] Brother Ron Spencer. They thought
[1:58:27] someone even said, "Was that brother Ron
[1:58:29] Spencer some time ago?" No, that was
[1:58:32] Brother Ron Spencer about 35 days after
[1:58:35] he was burned.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; That was about 35 days after he was
[1:58:39] laying laying in in there that he didn't
[1:58:42] know he'd live.
[1:58:43] you've been praying for brother Gary
[1:58:45] Walker and they and the medics that flew
[1:58:48] him by helicopter from the accident said
[1:58:51] they thought that he had gone and they
[1:58:53] said he's gone all the way from death to
[1:58:56] where he is today. Hallelujah. Sitting
[1:58:59] up in bed speaking to his wife.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; I say glory be to God.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; These are realities.
[1:59:13] And here's the wealth of meaning. He
[1:59:16] said it gathers it up for a quick work.
[1:59:19] And then in the Philadelphiaian age, he
[1:59:21] says, he goes on to say, because that
[1:59:24] you have taken my word and lived it and
[1:59:27] thereby become patient, I will keep you
[1:59:30] from the hour of temptation.
[1:59:33] He says, now here again, we see the
[1:59:35] overlapping of the two ages.
[1:59:38] For the promise has to do with the end
[1:59:41] of the gentile period. The promise has
[1:59:45] to do with the end of the gentile
[1:59:48] period. The gentile age or period he
[1:59:51] uses which culminates in the great
[1:59:54] tribulation.
[1:59:56] Can I have about 15 minutes?
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; I want to just come quickly to the age
[2:00:01] of the open door. Our open door
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; says that no man in heaven or in earth
[2:00:09] neither under the earth was able to open
[2:00:11] the book. Who's the book?
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Who's the book?
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[2:00:20] That word is in us.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the door." Amen.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; The Bible says when the 10 foolish
[2:00:31] virgins, five wise, five foolish I
[2:00:34] should say,
[2:00:36] heard the cry, the bridegroom cometh,
[2:00:39] five had oil and went in. Five did not
[2:00:42] have oil and did not go in. The Bible
[2:00:45] says the door was shut.
[2:00:48] Christ or the word was shut. How has the
[2:00:52] word shut? The word is shut when it's
[2:00:54] fulfilled. Amen.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; God never fulfilled the same promise
[2:00:59] twice.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; And if it gives a certain promise that
[2:01:05] Christ will come, he's not going to come
[2:01:07] again. He came once. The promise in the
[2:01:09] scripture, I'll send you Elijah or I'll
[2:01:12] send you a voice in the wilderness
[2:01:14] concerning John the Baptist. When John
[2:01:15] the Baptist was born and soon time,
[2:01:18] short time later he was beheaded, it was
[2:01:21] gone.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; That's fulfilled. And what if people
[2:01:24] said after he was gone, "Oh, I want to
[2:01:26] believe that. I want to believe that. I
[2:01:27] believe what Isaiah said. I believe it.
[2:01:29] Oh, God, forgive me. Cry all you want.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; The door is closed."
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Understand?
[2:01:38] And that's why that's why how many times
[2:01:40] in the message how many times he said
[2:01:43] even after the rapture has happened,
[2:01:45] there will be people God grant. This is
[2:01:48] my prayer while I preach. God grant
[2:01:51] there won't be anybody here have to say
[2:01:53] it. I thought Elijah was supposed to
[2:01:55] come. I thought there was supposed to be
[2:01:57] a rapture. Every time. Every time. Do
[2:02:02] you hear me? Brother Brandham said it'll
[2:02:04] be over.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; He never once said, "Oh, they'll reopen
[2:02:09] it."
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Never once will be reopened.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; The door is shut.
[2:02:18] And the Bible says, "And they went
[2:02:20] seeking oil."
[2:02:23] And brother Brandham said further and
[2:02:25] very clearly it was happening right in
[2:02:28] this day.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; That very event. And the bridegroom has
[2:02:32] come.
[2:02:35] And whether you realize it or not,
[2:02:37] you've gone into a very special place.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; And from here we go to the supper.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; From here we go to the supper. We're
[2:02:45] already shut in with him in a secret
[2:02:48] place. We're already in heavenly places.
[2:02:49] And from here we go to the supper.
[2:02:52] That's all. Hallelujah. From here we go
[2:02:54] to the supper.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Says, "Now we can see that Jesus is the
[2:03:04] door. He is the door of the sheep." And
[2:03:08] notice that it speaks now of the door
[2:03:10] opening. What is it? What is that but a
[2:03:14] revelation of him? A door opening. A
[2:03:17] revelation of him. And that revelation
[2:03:20] is opening up to bring us strength
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; to ultimate to illuminate the word and
[2:03:28] to glorify his name.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; You have
[2:03:33] I said before you an open door. He says
[2:03:34] you have a little strength. Brother
[2:03:36] Brandham says it involves all three. The
[2:03:39] word and the name. And now he says that
[2:03:43] has gone deep into this age where the
[2:03:46] revelation and the illumination of him,
[2:03:49] excuse me, is absolutely complete.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; And he illuminates the word and brings
[2:03:57] glory to his name.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ and his power of his coming
[2:04:06] at the end time was sealed up until this
[2:04:09] time. the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[2:04:12] Now these are his words. He he said you
[2:04:15] have I've set before you an open door.
[2:04:17] And this is what the open door he said
[2:04:19] that has such a deep meaning for this
[2:04:21] time because the al ultimate of the open
[2:04:24] door he says here is the is the uh the
[2:04:30] open door has to do with all three. He
[2:04:33] said it is the revelation, the opening
[2:04:35] up to bring us strength,
[2:04:39] to illuminate the word and to glorify
[2:04:42] his name. The revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:04:46] and of his power, of his coming and of
[2:04:49] the end time was sealed up until this
[2:04:52] time. And that and that's what he's come
[2:04:54] to do. That's what he has come to do.
[2:04:57] It's hid from the scholars,
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; but the vision has been sealed till
[2:05:03] right now.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; The vision's been sealed till right now,
[2:05:09] and it's been made open.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said when he prayed, I thank
[2:05:16] thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[2:05:19] because thou hast hid these things from
[2:05:21] the wise and the prudent and has
[2:05:24] revealed them unto babes. I hope I can
[2:05:26] just lift you up into your thoughts,
[2:05:29] high into your thoughts for a moment. I
[2:05:32] thank thee, Father. Here's the word.
[2:05:36] The door himself
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; standing on earth
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; in a physical form. The very door
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; of the sheepfold standing the very door
[2:05:49] the very word in flesh standing saying I
[2:05:53] thank you father that you've closed this
[2:05:55] door.
[2:05:57] Other words I thank you that you've hid
[2:05:59] it. Why? because he was he was
[2:06:01] addressing what came under the other
[2:06:04] system that crawled under the wall. I'm
[2:06:07] glad they couldn't figure out the tree
[2:06:09] back then and they can't figure it out
[2:06:10] now
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; and they can't figure out today.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham addresses the five
[2:06:19] foolish virgins and he said the question
[2:06:22] was are they lost? He said no they're
[2:06:24] not lost. Now, even Pentecost should
[2:06:27] learn something about that because he's
[2:06:28] got them out in outer darkness. They're
[2:06:30] in outer darkness. They haven't got
[2:06:31] light.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; And he is the light. But are they lost?
[2:06:35] Eternally lost. No. Said they're not.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; He said they're the only thing they
[2:06:41] didn't have was oil,
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; but they're clean in every other aspect.
[2:06:46] He says they're the same.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; That gives us a lot of comfort.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; They are not lost.
[2:06:57] Hallelujah.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; And so, friends, that helps us out.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; It teaches us how to uh h how to conduct
[2:07:04] ourselves around others. If they don't
[2:07:06] see the message, don't force it down
[2:07:08] their throat.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; God has to give them the revelation. If
[2:07:12] he doesn't give them the revelation,
[2:07:13] it's up to God.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Even some that respect the respect the
[2:07:19] message and respect what it produces and
[2:07:21] respect the messenger of the hour.
[2:07:26] And if somebody just speaks in vile
[2:07:29] terms against the messenger, against the
[2:07:32] word, just walk away from it.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Don't even force them.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:07:41] okay, now here we are.
[2:07:44] God help me. Here's these whole two
[2:07:48] realms that have been going. Jesus
[2:07:50] identified one and said they they can't
[2:07:53] see the word and so on. All right. Uh in
[2:07:57] Paul's day they had ships so he used the
[2:08:00] ship.
[2:08:03] In Luther's day they had just come
[2:08:06] through with the the Gutenberg press and
[2:08:09] they used the press but no one age.
[2:08:12] Here's here's the church ages now. Can
[2:08:15] you see the church ages? One just coming
[2:08:17] into the other. Here comes a messenger
[2:08:19] and he goes back and he shows how
[2:08:22] scientific achievement took place here.
[2:08:25] One advancement, one invention mel
[2:08:28] melted into the other one and the church
[2:08:30] ages one melted into the other one into
[2:08:32] the other one. And the second last one
[2:08:34] says I give I place before you an open
[2:08:36] door. And now a messenger comes and says
[2:08:38] and he pulls that back and says that has
[2:08:40] very deep meaning up here now because it
[2:08:42] was in this age when that open door was
[2:08:45] going to be fully made open and revealed
[2:08:47] who that door was and what the purpose
[2:08:50] of it was. So it had to be at this time
[2:08:52] in the meantime all of this advancement
[2:08:54] is taking place and and one thing didn't
[2:08:56] just you know one thing just didn't end
[2:08:59] another one started. So, I thought I
[2:09:01] would just take a a couple and probably
[2:09:03] some of you know this uh have read some
[2:09:05] of these things. But here's just a few
[2:09:07] of the wise men, wise men of the world,
[2:09:11] knowledgeable men, men of high office,
[2:09:14] men who know what they're talking about.
[2:09:17] And they were talking about I wanted to
[2:09:19] know what they said about the the
[2:09:21] advancement of the computer world and so
[2:09:24] on.
[2:09:27] Thomas Watson, the chairman of IBM. He
[2:09:31] ought to know something.
[2:09:33] Chairman of IBM in 1943.
[2:09:38] Don't think that's back in the dark
[2:09:39] ages. I was living in 1943.
[2:09:45] He said, I think there is a world market
[2:09:48] for maybe five computers.
[2:09:53] is IBM chairman of IBM. I think in the
[2:09:56] world there's a world market for about
[2:09:58] five computers. The popular science
[2:10:01] mechanics or popular mechanics magazine
[2:10:04] had an article they said while a
[2:10:06] calculator
[2:10:08] is equipped with 10,000
[2:10:10] vacuum tubes and weighs 30 tons.
[2:10:14] Said computers in the future may have
[2:10:17] only a thousand vacuum tubes and weigh
[2:10:19] only one and a half tons.
[2:10:27] What what can you say? Oh, we've come a
[2:10:29] long ways.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; And spiritually I say we've come a long
[2:10:33] ways.
[2:10:38] The editor in charge of business books
[2:10:41] for Apprentice Hall, which one of the
[2:10:43] greatest and largest publications, said,
[2:10:45] "I've traveled the length and breadth of
[2:10:48] this country and talked to the best
[2:10:50] people, and I can assure you that data
[2:10:53] processing is a fad that won't last a
[2:10:56] year."
[2:11:01] When they
[2:11:04] when the microchip came out,
[2:11:08] an engineer of advanced computing
[2:11:10] systems division of IBM says, "But what
[2:11:12] what is it good for?"
[2:11:18] I think I have one right here. I don't
[2:11:20] know. There's my sound system. I guess I
[2:11:22] haven't.
[2:11:24] He says there's
[2:11:26] this Ken Olsen, president and chairman
[2:11:28] and founder of Digital Equipment
[2:11:30] Corporation in 1977.
[2:11:34] He said there's no reason why anyone
[2:11:37] would want a computer in the home.
[2:11:40] How many computers do we have in homes
[2:11:42] here? I'd like to see your hands.
[2:11:45] Boy, he he didn't see what was going to
[2:11:47] be in your house.
[2:11:50] And furthermore, he didn't see what was
[2:11:51] going to be on your computer.
[2:11:54] He didn't dream that there'd be a voice
[2:11:57] of a man coming through on that
[2:12:00] computer. He didn't dream because that
[2:12:03] had been shut out from him.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; If you'd have told him just from 1977,
[2:12:08] that's not long ago. How many people
[2:12:09] were here in 1977? I mean alive in 1977.
[2:12:13] Let me see your Oh, look at all these
[2:12:15] old-timers. My goodness.
[2:12:19] You were here in 1977 and you had the
[2:12:21] president and chief executive officer of
[2:12:23] digital systems saying that there isn't
[2:12:25] any use for you to even have one in your
[2:12:27] home.
[2:12:30] You think for a moment if you got back
[2:12:32] then said, "I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Ken
[2:12:34] Olson, president. I respect you, but you
[2:12:37] haven't got a clue. I'm going to sit I'm
[2:12:39] going to sit in my computer and I'm
[2:12:41] going to be able to actually I'm going
[2:12:43] to pull up uh I'm going to pull up
[2:12:45] messages of a prophet of God that have
[2:12:47] been translated in other languages and
[2:12:49] they're actually coming down into my
[2:12:51] computer. They're coming down on a on a
[2:12:54] daily basis. They're coming down and I
[2:12:56] even have the voice of that messenger on
[2:12:58] there
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; and I listen to over,00 sermons on
[2:13:02] there. Can you believe that? He'd say,
[2:13:04] "Ah, nonsense.
[2:13:07] Do you know who you're talking to? And
[2:13:09] then you have to say, you know who
[2:13:10] you're talking to.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; Don't lose me now.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; And Bill Gates.
[2:13:19] I thought that that last name, my wife
[2:13:22] was struck by it,
[2:13:25] was quite unique.
[2:13:28] Gates.
[2:13:31] Bill Gates. He opened up quite a gate,
[2:13:34] didn't he?
[2:13:36] for this system down here,
[2:13:40] but perhaps didn't realize there's going
[2:13:43] to be a group of people up here going to
[2:13:45] tap into that. So, we're going to use
[2:13:47] that for a purpose you never dreamed
[2:13:50] would ever be possible. All these
[2:13:52] voices, all this vulgarity, it does me a
[2:13:56] great deal. I'm not just preaching now.
[2:13:58] I'm going to unload the burden of my
[2:14:00] heart. It does me a great deal of
[2:14:02] satisfaction right in the midst of all
[2:14:04] that evil to push that voice through, to
[2:14:07] push it through in this language, to
[2:14:09] push it through in another language, and
[2:14:10] let the people around the world hear it.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I want to say to this
[2:14:17] church, you haven't got a clue where
[2:14:18] it's going.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; I don't mean just where it's going
[2:14:21] geographically, where we're going
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; with this.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:27] By God's grace, I believe that in the
[2:14:30] future days, and not very far in the
[2:14:32] future, there'll be people be able to
[2:14:34] pull it down and and and and print it in
[2:14:36] their language.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; All over the world, there'll be no
[2:14:40] borders for the message at all anymore.
[2:14:43] You think that's where it's going?
[2:14:44] That's exactly where it's going.
[2:14:47] I see where there will be hundreds,
[2:14:48] maybe even thousands of individuals and
[2:14:51] pastors and and lay men and people
[2:14:54] burdened for the word that'll be in
[2:14:56] charge and they'll be printing out this
[2:14:58] message and giving it out to their out
[2:15:01] to the people of their area. Where will
[2:15:04] they be pulling it from? Right from the
[2:15:06] heavens
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; where it should come from.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God, his people is is
[2:15:12] amazing. I don't know if you've been on
[2:15:14] and you you hear the very first tape,
[2:15:17] the very first tape that is that's even
[2:15:19] made and the first words out of Brother
[2:15:21] Brandham's mouth is they've got some
[2:15:23] kind of a new gadget here
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; called a tape recorder.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; They got some kind of a new gadget. His
[2:15:33] first words on the first recorded
[2:15:35] message, they've got some kind of a new
[2:15:37] gadget
[2:15:38] called a tape recorder.
[2:15:41] and men that were faithful but didn't
[2:15:44] realize they began to record that and
[2:15:46] everybody got into the tape business or
[2:15:48] Roberts and Katherryn Kman and everybody
[2:15:50] got in disposing and sending off with
[2:15:53] their tapes etc etc but I tell you
[2:15:55] there's an allegiance there's a loyalty
[2:15:57] to what God gave uh this messenger and
[2:16:01] that voice and in the days of the voice
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; of the seventh angel I tell you I weep
[2:16:06] every time I take people up there with
[2:16:08] brother Murphy brother Timothy brother
[2:16:10] Ivan these brothers that are translating
[2:16:12] and brother Murphy is is is o overlaying
[2:16:15] the voice over and other brothers
[2:16:17] whether they be in voice of God studios
[2:16:19] or where they are anywhere in the world.
[2:16:22] I'm so thankful to God that that voice
[2:16:24] is going up in the midst of all this
[2:16:26] other nonsense and in the midst of all
[2:16:28] this other rift wrath in the midst of
[2:16:31] all this violence is a pure word.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you listening to me? A
[2:16:36] bleeding word.
[2:16:38] In the midst of all of that is a
[2:16:40] bleeding word.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; It's called Christ. The door's been
[2:16:44] opened and no man can shut it.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; No man can shut it.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; They've tried to shut it.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; They've tried to say all kinds of nasty
[2:16:59] things, but the more they said, the
[2:17:01] further it went.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:07] And today over a hundred million
[2:17:10] websites
[2:17:12] and billions of pages, billions, you
[2:17:15] never live long enough.
[2:17:18] Science is moving on and education at
[2:17:20] such a at a such a pace. And the prophet
[2:17:23] said in the image to the beast, he said,
[2:17:26] "We're moving on. Science is moving on.
[2:17:29] Education's moving on. And the gospel is
[2:17:33] moving on.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; I hope you're as excited about this as I
[2:17:37] am.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; I want to tell this church today because
[2:17:41] I have a personal
[2:17:43] a very personal burden in my heart. I
[2:17:46] believe I'm going to live to say it. I
[2:17:49] believe there'll be a access to the
[2:17:53] message. Might say, "Well, it's on the
[2:17:54] internet now. You haven't seen anything
[2:17:56] yet. You haven't seen anything." see
[2:17:59] people in little corners of the world
[2:18:02] where they can scarcely get it. I can
[2:18:04] see that the translations will be coming
[2:18:06] in to a center and they'll be able to
[2:18:08] tap in and those translations will be in
[2:18:10] their language will be downloaded in a
[2:18:13] matter of hours
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; and I'm speaking about ourselves in
[2:18:17] India. We get a translation and it might
[2:18:19] take weeks or months before we can get
[2:18:22] it printed and distributed. Do you hear
[2:18:25] what I'm saying? I'm talking about a
[2:18:28] translator maybe in India giving a
[2:18:30] translation. It'll be uploaded and
[2:18:33] downloaded into a person's into their
[2:18:35] computer and being printed within hours
[2:18:38] of the brother having it finished.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Timothy Maul right now is in the
[2:18:45] Vietnam. Do you know that I know that I
[2:18:47] know the men I I've been in Singapore. I
[2:18:50] know the men that have struggled to get
[2:18:52] the message into Vietnam. And here God
[2:18:55] somehow brings a man by into this
[2:18:58] church. This is the door. This this to
[2:19:00] me is a great door. He didn't know my
[2:19:03] name. He didn't know the name of this
[2:19:05] church. I didn't know his name. He never
[2:19:07] asked to meet us or anybody here.
[2:19:10] Timothy M. I never asked to meet him. I
[2:19:12] didn't know he existed. He brings God
[2:19:14] brings the two together for one great
[2:19:17] purpose of his. And then what is the
[2:19:20] purpose? to get that gospel out, to get
[2:19:22] that message out, to get that word out,
[2:19:24] and to have several hundred now, over
[2:19:27] 300 messages in Vietnamese, and he's
[2:19:30] there right now with pastors and giving
[2:19:33] them access and people over there
[2:19:36] translating the messages, and he's
[2:19:38] correcting them. We have three
[2:19:40] translators, if not four, in China that
[2:19:42] are translating, three of them
[2:19:44] full-time. One is in New Zealand every
[2:19:46] day. Every day translating every day.
[2:19:49] and they come and pass back and forth on
[2:19:51] this great great system that that this
[2:19:55] uh the system of the world has opened up
[2:19:57] to us. But God is using it.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; In the days of Jesus, it was the Roman
[2:20:07] Empire, the great Roman Empire. And in a
[2:20:10] in the age of the open door prior to
[2:20:13] that, we have the great British Empire.
[2:20:15] And they according to what I was able to
[2:20:18] discover there was 85 nations 85 nations
[2:20:23] countries all of Canada is one Australia
[2:20:27] is another New Zealand is another the
[2:20:30] entire continent of India was another
[2:20:32] but 85 were in that British Empire you
[2:20:36] say they colonized the world and the all
[2:20:39] the kingdoms of the world had war and
[2:20:42] strife and fighting over it but at the
[2:20:44] same time God was in it. God was
[2:20:47] allowing it because those people who
[2:20:48] would never have spoken English now had
[2:20:51] to speak English. And English becomes
[2:20:53] the language of business. Lingui English
[2:20:56] is the language of the travel industry.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; Let me give you I have I have a
[2:21:03] statistic right here. China
[2:21:06] has more English-speaking people in it
[2:21:10] today than the United States has.
[2:21:16] Do you know why? Because they're whole.
[2:21:20] They're obsessed. They're gripped by
[2:21:23] business. Business must go ahead. And
[2:21:26] China is a great dynamic force today. It
[2:21:30] is an incredible dynamic force. And so
[2:21:32] the second language in all of China is
[2:21:35] for English to be taught.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; So they're teaching English to the
[2:21:38] people. Why? So they can have the
[2:21:40] economic system down here working. But
[2:21:42] why is God allowing it? God wants it.
[2:21:45] God's promoting it. So those people can
[2:21:47] hear also the messenger
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; and we're in support of it. This church
[2:21:54] ought to ought to be thankful to God
[2:21:56] that God, you give a tithing, you give
[2:21:58] an offering, you give something, you
[2:22:00] give of yourself. I'm calling this
[2:22:02] morning on this church. I'm calling on
[2:22:06] the people of this church to give
[2:22:08] themselves physically and unreservedly
[2:22:11] to whatever God may call you to do. We
[2:22:14] cannot do this by one or two people or
[2:22:17] 10 people. We got very devoted people,
[2:22:20] incredibly devoted people. And if you
[2:22:23] just say, whether I mop a floor or
[2:22:26] whether I have a shovel in my hand or
[2:22:29] whether I just count out some books or
[2:22:31] whether I look after this or whether I'm
[2:22:33] just able to only pray and give of my
[2:22:36] offerings, I let you know, friends, I
[2:22:38] want you to know it is it is far worth
[2:22:41] far more than anything else you can
[2:22:43] accomplish in this world.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; I think of the brothers that give
[2:22:48] themselves give themselves freely.
[2:22:50] Deacons give themselves. Trustees give
[2:22:53] themselves.
[2:22:57] We need you.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; We need you. And I'm done. I've been
[2:23:02] long.
[2:23:07] I have been gripped by this scripture
[2:23:09] and a great
[2:23:12] door and effectual is opened unto me.
[2:23:17] Brother Timothy or rather brother Murphy
[2:23:20] when this is already burning on my heart
[2:23:22] down Murphy'sboro
[2:23:24] and brother just brother Murphy and
[2:23:26] myself sitting and I said to brother
[2:23:28] brother Derek may have been there but I
[2:23:30] said to brother Murphy did you ask to
[2:23:32] meet me
[2:23:35] said no and I said and I never asked to
[2:23:37] meet you I didn't I didn't know you from
[2:23:39] anybody
[2:23:41] and yet your footsteps are ordained in
[2:23:43] such a way
[2:23:46] and we meet and all I'm not able to do
[2:23:48] what you're able to do. I don't know
[2:23:50] Chinese,
[2:23:53] but I know there's 1.3 billion people
[2:23:55] over there and the fact that we're able
[2:23:58] to even reach a handful. Incidentally,
[2:24:03] yesterday some of our people were
[2:24:05] arrested.
[2:24:10] pastor
[2:24:11] and some of the people as they came out
[2:24:12] of the water of baptism
[2:24:16] were taken right then
[2:24:19] yesterday day before yesterday Friday.
[2:24:26] You can't go over there and shake their
[2:24:29] hand and say, "I'm going to pray for
[2:24:30] you." You can't get to where they're
[2:24:32] being held.
[2:24:37] But one thing for sure, listen. One
[2:24:40] thing for absolutely certain on every
[2:24:44] person listening.
[2:24:46] The prophet of God said that that age of
[2:24:48] the open door is coming deep into this
[2:24:52] age.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; And he wanted to get the meaning of the
[2:24:55] open door to us. It says the meaning of
[2:24:58] the open door. It is in you have little
[2:25:01] strength.
[2:25:03] the word,
[2:25:05] the revelation, the illumination of the
[2:25:07] word.
[2:25:08] And he he he gave and the word itself,
[2:25:11] those three things, those people have
[2:25:14] embraced what they've heard.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; And what they've heard has come from the
[2:25:19] brothers that fellowship right here in
[2:25:21] this church. It has come through people
[2:25:24] such as brother John Lei, brother John
[2:25:27] Sacker, brother
[2:25:30] brother Murphy, brother and to us
[2:25:35] don't make the mistake of saying well
[2:25:38] you know yeah there are brothers etc.
[2:25:41] Don't belittle what God is doing through
[2:25:44] these brothers. It is an enormous work
[2:25:46] and don't belittle what God is doing in
[2:25:49] your own in your own circle. You may
[2:25:52] say, "Well, what what are we able to
[2:25:54] do?" I tell you, every member of the
[2:25:56] body of Christ have their part. I don't
[2:25:59] care what it is. I don't care if it's
[2:26:00] one of these children that puts 25 cents
[2:26:03] in the mission offering plate. It's
[2:26:05] going to go someplace. It's going to go
[2:26:07] to a good cause. And furthermore, I say
[2:26:09] to this congregation, we give more out
[2:26:11] for missions than comes in the missions
[2:26:14] missions offering. It goes more than
[2:26:16] that goes out.
[2:26:19] Now,
[2:26:20] brother Brennham, he spoke about that
[2:26:23] last age and he says they're handing out
[2:26:25] tracks and handing out booklets and
[2:26:28] handing out things and they built
[2:26:31] schools and built these kind of things
[2:26:33] over there and Bible schools and so on.
[2:26:35] Says we're not into that. But let me
[2:26:37] just make one very clear distinction.
[2:26:39] when you hand out a message because he
[2:26:41] said it's the preaching of the gospel
[2:26:42] with power. And he said when you hand
[2:26:45] out I'm saying when you hand out a
[2:26:47] message book, you're handing out a
[2:26:49] sermon.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; You're not handing out a tract.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; You're not just handing out a book that
[2:26:55] somebody wrote. That that message book
[2:26:58] happens to be preaching.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; It is preaching and the clearest
[2:27:03] preaching that I know of. And then the
[2:27:05] works need they absolutely have to have
[2:27:08] ministry. Brother Tony has gone and will
[2:27:10] be going again I think to India and uh
[2:27:13] and there's something being planned
[2:27:15] right after the first of the year
[2:27:16] because there's there's great needs
[2:27:18] amongst the ministry and amongst the
[2:27:20] churches for those things. Brother
[2:27:22] that's why brother Timothy's over there
[2:27:24] now. That's why brother Murphy goes
[2:27:26] every year there. And I'm I just say to
[2:27:28] the congregation,
[2:27:31] I had a very very very heavy heart when
[2:27:34] brother Murphy was over this year and we
[2:27:37] had the first time to share it when when
[2:27:40] he was with me in Murphy'sboro
[2:27:43] and I said I was very burdened for you
[2:27:46] and quite frankly I'm not one to be
[2:27:48] dictated by fear but I was I was
[2:27:52] somewhat fearful that you'd be arrested
[2:27:56] because when we were arrested. They told
[2:27:58] us that if a Chinese if a Chinese who
[2:28:02] has a dual citizenship
[2:28:05] is arrested, they said we will they do
[2:28:08] away with the Canadian passport and deal
[2:28:11] with them as as a a national. They said
[2:28:16] they've been in prison for over a year
[2:28:19] and do not have a date set even for a
[2:28:21] court hearing.
[2:28:24] Brother Murphy told me while he was
[2:28:26] there and was now planning to make a
[2:28:29] trip to a certain place to be with a
[2:28:32] certain man that that man had a phone
[2:28:35] call from the police saying we know that
[2:28:39] this Murphy is coming there and if he
[2:28:42] does there is big serious trouble and
[2:28:45] that brother called brother Murphy said
[2:28:48] don't come.
[2:28:50] Now, that's just how how critical it is
[2:28:52] at times.
[2:28:57] And I just said to Brother Murphy, you
[2:28:59] happen to be Brother Brandham's voice to
[2:29:03] that nation.
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; As far as I know, there's not another
[2:29:07] single one tape of Brother Brham's voice
[2:29:10] going over there from anywhere else. I
[2:29:13] don't know if there is. If there is, I
[2:29:14] don't know anything about it. But now we
[2:29:16] have here, and I I and I'm trying to
[2:29:18] close. I have here is a very very
[2:29:21] unusual gathering. Very unusual church.
[2:29:24] There's people of probably between 35
[2:29:27] and 40 nations in this church. That
[2:29:30] happens to be very unusual. Number two,
[2:29:33] there's people here probably 40% from
[2:29:36] the from the US side. Probably at least
[2:29:40] 40%. And I tell you, you you may have
[2:29:43] wondered sometime why in the world are
[2:29:45] we here? Well, one reason you're here is
[2:29:49] because you've been a great great
[2:29:52] comfort to me and you've been a great
[2:29:55] asset to this church and you have
[2:29:57] brought an essential uh something
[2:30:01] essential from the American culture that
[2:30:04] we don't have and it was needful for
[2:30:07] getting the message where it is today.
[2:30:09] And I felt I needed to express myself. I
[2:30:12] groan each time I go across the border.
[2:30:15] And I know that you do. But I'll just
[2:30:17] tell you in the name of the Lord. Your
[2:30:19] labor is not in vain.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; Time you spend at the border is not in
[2:30:24] vain. Your giving is not in vain. Your
[2:30:26] presence is not in vain. You've come to
[2:30:29] the you've come to the to the to to the
[2:30:32] vineyard at this season. We all have.
[2:30:35] We've come to the v vineyard at this
[2:30:37] season like Esther did. And we're here
[2:30:40] on behalf of those that are still
[2:30:43] striving to be to be liberated and be
[2:30:46] found and be found and to be set free.
[2:30:50] And I will say to you in the name of the
[2:30:52] Lord Jesus Christ, if if I don't live to
[2:30:55] see it, you will if the Lord Jesus
[2:30:58] terries. And you'll be hearing of this
[2:31:01] message going into places and corners of
[2:31:04] the earth that have hitherto been
[2:31:07] completely unthought of into distant
[2:31:10] places into the interior of China into
[2:31:13] Europe and places where it's so
[2:31:15] restricted. This message is going to go
[2:31:18] and I I I'd like to have a yay and amen
[2:31:21] from you if you believe it. Every last
[2:31:23] elected seed will come.
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; And I would like to think that this is a
[2:31:27] unique place. I didn't design this
[2:31:29] place. I didn't ask you to come here.
[2:31:31] God brought you here.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; I didn't even ask to come here myself. I
[2:31:35] thought I lost my my better sense, my
[2:31:37] better judgment when I came here. We're
[2:31:40] all strangers and pilgrims.
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; I came 3,500 miles to be here.
[2:31:46] And many of you did. We didn't choose
[2:31:49] that.
[2:31:51] I sit back and I marvel in this
[2:31:54] congregation. Very few people from this.
[2:31:56] Brother Brandham said, "How many people
[2:31:57] from Jeffersonville?" Just a handful.
[2:32:00] How many people here from Cloverdale?
[2:32:01] Just a handful. How many people even
[2:32:03] here from this area that were that
[2:32:05] aren't here because of the church? Just
[2:32:06] a handful. But then if we said, "What
[2:32:09] about the rest of you?" Those are the
[2:32:11] ones out of the Jefferson Valley
[2:32:13] Tabernacle. They're the ones that really
[2:32:16] took a hold of it and spread and got
[2:32:17] under the burden. And I would say, "God
[2:32:19] bless you as a congregation. God bless
[2:32:21] you in your homes. God bless you in your
[2:32:24] labor. God bless you and your spiritual
[2:32:26] walk with God. And I trust that the
[2:32:28] meetings and the things that God does
[2:32:30] here are divinely ordained of the Holy
[2:32:33] Spirit.
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; And I trust you will accept this
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; out of the bosom of my soul.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; That's the only way it's going to
[2:32:43] happen. And that's the way it is
[2:32:45] happening. But I but but I don't want
[2:32:47] you to restrict your vision this
[2:32:48] morning.
[2:32:51] These men were wise that thought of the
[2:32:54] the system of this world. And I'm
[2:32:56] closing with this. They were wise men.
[2:32:59] And then now the things that they said
[2:33:01] just a few years ago are humorous. Our
[2:33:04] young people are humored.
[2:33:06] Bill Gates telling you you there isn't a
[2:33:08] person that needs over 640K.
[2:33:12] And I say there isn't a person who
[2:33:13] raised their hands that has 640K.
[2:33:16] You're in the gigabytes.
[2:33:18] multi- gigabytes. You're into doing
[2:33:21] things that he didn't even dream of just
[2:33:23] a few years ago and he's still not an
[2:33:25] old man.
[2:33:27] Likewise, spiritually, let us not be,
[2:33:31] you know, restricted and bound in our
[2:33:33] mind. Let's see the possibilities. The
[2:33:36] door of opportunity is open to this
[2:33:39] congregation.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not just going to go
[2:33:46] on. There's more happening under just
[2:33:48] under the current than you even realize.
[2:33:51] I want you to I want you to catch a hold
[2:33:52] of that vision and say, "God, I may not
[2:33:55] understood everything was in my heart,
[2:33:56] but I'm going to believe what Brother
[2:33:57] Bisll was saying this morning. I'm going
[2:33:59] to believe it. I'm going to support it.
[2:34:01] I'm going to pray for it with all my
[2:34:02] heart and soul. I'm going to pray for
[2:34:04] those that are involved. I'm going to
[2:34:06] pray for those that give themselves. If
[2:34:08] I can't do anymore, that's one thing I
[2:34:10] can do."
[2:34:12] God bless you.
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's stand for our
[2:34:22] I'm sorry I was a half an hour over what
[2:34:24] even intended on being the musicians
[2:34:27] here.
[2:34:36] We had a phone call this last week
[2:34:40] and a lady was on the phone. She said,
[2:34:44] "I understand I heard from somebody that
[2:34:46] you people used to have this log log
[2:34:48] house log church down here." Said,
[2:34:50] "Yeah."
[2:34:52] She says, "Well, there's a huge
[2:34:53] chandelier."
[2:34:55] I had the chandelier made. It's about 16
[2:34:57] to 20 feet across with just a whole big
[2:35:00] ring of lights and up at the top's
[2:35:01] probably about a six foot chandelier.
[2:35:05] said, "We'd like to give it to you. You
[2:35:07] just want to come and take it down."
[2:35:10] So, some of you old-timers that know how
[2:35:12] heavy it is. You can be the next ring of
[2:35:15] volunteers.
[2:35:19] If we decide to take it, we got to just
[2:35:21] take it down and dismantle it. It's not
[2:35:24] much. Just a little job.
[2:35:28] Did I see your hand up, brother David
[2:35:30] Laws? Yeah. Good. Good. I got one of
[2:35:33] her. How great is our God? How great is
[2:35:36] his name? Let's be here on early this
[2:35:39] evening. Hallelujah. We don't know what
[2:35:42] God's I've asked God today already to
[2:35:44] take over control of the meeting. Take
[2:35:46] over control. Hallelujah.
[2:35:49] How great is our God?
[2:35:53] How great is his name?
[2:35:57] He's the greatest
[2:36:01] forever the same.
[2:36:05] He roll back the water
[2:36:10] by sea
[2:36:14] and
[2:36:16] you
[2:36:18] put your trust in me.
[2:36:22] How great is our God.
[2:36:26] God his name.
[2:36:30] He's the greatest
[2:36:34] forever.
[2:36:38] He
[2:36:40] [Music]
[2:36:43] will
[2:36:47] [Music]
[2:36:53] sing that last verse again. And I was
[2:36:55] all locked into the first verse with my
[2:36:57] eyes shut. So help me sing this last one
[2:36:59] again. How great is our God.
[2:37:04] How great is his word.
[2:37:08] He's the greatest.
[2:37:11] [Music]
[2:37:24] And
[2:37:25] [Music]
[2:37:33] Amen.
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:37:36] Hallelujah.
[2:37:38] Going to ask our brother Bohan,
[2:37:41] brother Andrew's father, if you'd come
[2:37:42] and pray for us to do that.
[2:37:52] How great is our God?
[2:37:55] [Music]
[2:38:18] and he
[2:38:24] [Music]
[2:38:26] moan to ask God's blessing upon the
[2:38:28] congregation. May the Holy Spirit have
[2:38:32] prevail in every single life. Amen. Our
[2:38:38] gracious heavenly father,
[2:38:40] we thank you that you have called us at
[2:38:43] such a time as this. Lord,
[2:38:46] father, we thank you that the open door
[2:38:49] has
[2:38:51] embraced us.
[2:38:54] You stood at the door, Lord Jesus, and
[2:38:56] you received us.
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:38:59] &gt;&gt; we accepted you.
[2:39:02] We came to know you.
[2:39:04] You made known yourself to us.
[2:39:07] &gt;&gt; You revealed the Godhead to us.
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; Father, today we see you moving in your
[2:39:13] church.
[2:39:15] &gt;&gt; We see you moving in this congregation.
[2:39:18] We see you moving with the message in
[2:39:20] its last throws, Father, across this
[2:39:23] world.
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; And we are recipients of this message
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; and we are carriers of this message.
[2:39:31] Eternal Father, how blessed we are today
[2:39:36] to be involved. How blessed we are to be
[2:39:38] included.
[2:39:40] And Father, as we come
[2:39:43] to the next phase,
[2:39:45] we pray that the same glory that brought
[2:39:48] us to this stage would be the same glory
[2:39:51] to take us to the next stage.
[2:39:54] Father, we come humbly being unworthy
[2:39:57] before you. And Lord, knowing that our
[2:40:00] lives are just fading out too and that
[2:40:03] the end is approaching us, Father, and
[2:40:06] there's a desperation in our hearts that
[2:40:10] Lord, we must accomplish what was
[2:40:14] planned and prefigured before for us.
[2:40:18] And so we pray today that the spirit of
[2:40:22] the Lord God will give us the next step
[2:40:25] and you will show us the next door and
[2:40:28] the next opening and the next father and
[2:40:31] the next and the next and oh God we will
[2:40:33] be oh Lord worthy servants to proceed
[2:40:37] into these open doors. We thank you for
[2:40:39] this message. We thank you for this
[2:40:41] challenge this morning.
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; We thank you for our pastor and with the
[2:40:45] revelation you have given to him. Oh
[2:40:47] God, you have brought us mysteriously
[2:40:50] unto this place. And father, the spirit
[2:40:52] of the Lord God is in this place.
[2:40:56] Father, help us. We pray as we go give
[2:40:58] us jouring mercies now in the name of
[2:41:01] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; And amen.
[2:41:08] God bless you. Thank you so much. We
[2:41:10] bless you. We just miss you in Jesus
[2:41:12] name. meeting has been long, but I want
[2:41:15] you to be get a little refreshment and
[2:41:17] rest for this evening.

[2:41:22] of the border and they wish to stay for
[2:41:23] this evening, give them an invite to
[2:41:26] your place. God will bless you for it.
[2:41:28] Things we can do. God bless you. You're
[2:41:29] all dismissed in Jesus name.
