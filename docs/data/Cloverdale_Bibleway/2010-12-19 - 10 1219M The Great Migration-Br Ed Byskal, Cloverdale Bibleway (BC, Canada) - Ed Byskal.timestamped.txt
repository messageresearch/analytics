[19:47] supernaturally.
[19:49] He did so well they discharged him after

[20:18] We want to remember
[20:21] our brother Frank Fletcher this morning
[20:23] not feeling well in body. Some in my
[20:26] household as well. My mom and dad are
[20:28] visiting from back east and my mom being
[20:31] so gracious took care of the kids while
[20:33] they were sick and well got her too. So
[20:36] we want to remember them this morning
[20:37] that the Lord would be their portion.
[20:40] Amen. And if you have a need upon your
[20:41] heart or need in your body, the great
[20:44] physician is always on hand. Brother
[20:47] Peter, why don't you come as we remember
[20:50] these requests and
[20:52] prayer this morning.
[20:54] If you have an unspoken request, maybe
[20:57] make it known to the Lord just by an
[20:59] uplifted hand.
[21:04] Our heavenly father,
[21:07] Lord Jesus, we're so grateful to you
[21:09] that we can call you our father.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; We can call you our redeemer,
[21:14] &gt;&gt; our savior.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Lord God, you've done so much for us.
[21:20] Lord Jesus,
[21:23] as I was just reading before the
[21:25] service, Father,
[21:27] oh Lord God, when you were here, you
[21:29] were just
[21:31] you're walking with the people that
[21:32] you've redeemed, the people that you
[21:34] said that they were your sheep and they
[21:35] were hearing your voice,
[21:38] oh Lord Jesus, and when you came to the
[21:40] grave of Lazarus, Lord God, how you wept
[21:43] and it was just a man just standing
[21:45] there. But your prophet says that was
[21:48] more than a man when he spoke. Lazarus
[21:50] come forth Lord Jesus. You you have
[21:52] called each one of us Lord Jesus out of
[21:54] your our traditions out of our sins out
[21:57] of out of where whatever we came from
[21:59] Lord Jesus. You've resurrected us to new
[22:01] life Lord Jesus. You are redeemer. You
[22:04] are savior father. You are healer Lord
[22:06] God. Oh Lord God you are the
[22:09] resurrection and the life Lord God. We

[22:12] for what you have done and what you are
[22:14] doing amongst us Lord God. Thank you for
[22:16] the message of the hour. Thank you for
[22:18] the word that you've given unto us Lord
[22:20] Jesus.
[22:21] Oh Lord God, because by your word is the
[22:24] only thing that we may live live by,
[22:26] Lord Jesus. Not by anything of this
[22:28] world, Lord God. By by the spoken word
[22:30] that was promised for this generation,
[22:32] Lord Jesus, that you've proven once
[22:34] again that you're alive, that you are
[22:36] the same yesterday, today, and forever,
[22:37] Lord Jesus. And we pray that you'd come
[22:39] down once again this morning, Father.
[22:41] And you speak to us, Lord God. May you
[22:44] ignite our hearts, ignite our faith,
[22:45] Lord Jesus. You know exactly the need of
[22:47] every person that is here, Lord Jesus.
[22:50] May you abide with us, Father. May you
[22:52] walk with us, Lord Jesus. May you draw
[22:54] near unto us, Lord Jesus. We're so
[22:57] thankful to you and we're grateful to
[22:59] you, Father, that you answer prayer,
[23:01] Lord God. And we ask that you, Father,
[23:03] you answer, Father, these requests are
[23:06] repent down, Lord God. We pray for our
[23:08] brother Frank Fletcher, Lord God. How
[23:10] has been he has been an inspiration to
[23:12] me, Lord Jesus, seeing this this man,
[23:15] Father, that's been so faithful to you,
[23:17] Lord God. May you raise him up once
[23:20] again. May you prove to him that you are
[23:21] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[23:24] That you are the resurrection and the
[23:25] life. You are the healer, Lord God. May
[23:28] you also touch our brothers and sisters,
[23:31] Lord Jesus. All those who have needs
[23:33] this evening, this morning, Father, and
[23:35] the parents of Brother Derek Paris,
[23:37] Father, may you touch them, Lord God.
[23:39] May you heal them. We believe that you
[23:41] are a healer and you are our redeemer.
[23:43] May you speak to us this morning. May
[23:45] your name be glorified. We want to tell
[23:47] you and say that we love you father in

[24:07] you come and get ready?
[24:10] Brother Isaac's going to sing a special
[24:12] for us.
[24:14] Amen. I think I'll uh wait till all the
[24:17] Sunday school kids come in for the
[24:19] announcements. One of them pertains to
[24:21] them. Do you love the Lord this morning?
[24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those on the internet hook up and

[24:32] as well. Just trust that you enjoy the
[24:34] special this morning. And
[24:36] Brother Isaac, are you ready? All right.
[24:49] [Music]
[25:00] Beyond the sun set,
[25:06] oh blissful morning
[25:11] And with our Savior,
[25:16] heaven is begun.
[25:22] Earth's toiling ended.
[25:27] Oh, glorious
[25:29] dawning
[25:33] beyond the sunset.
[25:38] When day is done
[25:43] beyond the sunet,
[25:48] no clouds will gather.
[25:54] No storms will threaten.
[25:59] No fears annoy.
[26:04] Oh day of gladness,
[26:10] oh day unending
[26:15] beyond the sunset,
[26:21] eternal joy.
[26:26] Beyond the sun set,
[26:31] a hand will guide me
[26:36] to God my father
[26:41] whom I adore.
[26:47] His glorious presence,
[26:52] his words of welcome
[26:57] will be my portion
[27:03] on that fair shore.
[27:18] beyond the sun set.
[27:24] Oh glad reunion
[27:29] with our dear love ones
[27:34] who've gone before.
[27:39] In that fair home land,
[27:44] we'll know no parting
[27:50] beyond the sunset
[27:55] forever
[27:57] more.
[28:00] there with my Jesus
[28:06] forever
[28:08] more.
[28:13] [Music]
[28:19] Amen. Thank you, brother Isaac.
[28:21] Appreciate that very much.
[28:24] Amen. Well, I've got a couple of
[28:26] announcements. So, why don't I go ahead
[28:27] and read those and we'll turn the
[28:30] service over to Brother Ed. I think
[28:32] Brother Ryan, you've got a special for
[28:33] us. I don't want to forget that. So, if
[28:36] I hurry things along too much, Brother
[28:37] Ryan will hit a key. It'll remind me
[28:40] he's going to sing. All right. Remember,
[28:43] although there is no Sunday school
[28:45] classes next Sunday, please have your
[28:47] children in the fellowship hall no later
[28:49] than 10:15 so they can practice for the
[28:52] special. Sunday school will resume at
[28:55] 9:45 on January the 2nd. All right, so
[28:58] we've got that announcement in.
[29:02] How many senior campers do we have here?
[29:04] Let me see a show of hands. Get them up
[29:06] high, guys. All right, this one's for
[29:08] you. Camp winter registration forms are
[29:11] now available at the tithe and offering
[29:13] boxes in the back. They are due by
[29:16] Sunday, January 9th. So, that gives you
[29:18] a couple of weeks to make sure that you
[29:20] get your registration forms filled in.
[29:22] How many would like to get the
[29:23] registration form filled out in the box
[29:26] before the end of the year?
[29:28] All right, I got six. I think three
[29:31] here, one over there, and two back
[29:33] there. All right, I saw a counselor get
[29:35] his hand up. So, praise the Lord. Let's
[29:37] make sure we get those forms in timely
[29:39] so we don't have to remind you once
[29:42] again that it's time for camp. How many
[29:45] know how far away it is?
[29:49] It's less than 40 days. Inside of 40
[29:52] days. It's not at the end of February.
[29:54] It's at the 1st of February. Basically
[29:55] the end of January. All right. We're
[29:58] excited for camp.
[30:02] Those that would like to sing a special
[30:04] during watch night.
[30:07] During the watch night service, we would
[30:08] like to have you contact Brother Ryan or
[30:11] Sister Elena Hendrickson personally or
[30:14] by email so that we can kind of
[30:16] formulate a plan of attack as to how
[30:19] we're going to get everybody fit in. I
[30:21] know Brother Ed's uh working very
[30:23] earnestly on getting the uh folks from
[30:26] overseas connected with us. So, we're
[30:27] not sure how it's all going to
[30:28] orchestrate together, but we know the
[30:30] mind of the Lord is to have things
[30:32] happen in an orderly fashion. So if we
[30:34] can have you get in contact with brother
[30:36] Ryan if you'd like to sing. So that'd be
[30:39] really great.
[30:43] It's also the end of the year 2010. So
[30:46] tax receipts uh say that you need to
[30:48] have any tithes or offerings or uh
[30:51] things that you would like to have a
[30:53] receipt for in by the end of the year.
[30:55] So, you've got uh just a couple more
[30:57] weekends to get your tithes and
[30:59] offerings and uh love gifts in for the
[31:03] receipts before the end of the year. So,
[31:05] make sure you get that done so that we
[31:08] can have that well taken care of.
[31:11] Service this afternoon, it'll be at 400
[31:14] p.m. We'll have a communion service.
[31:15] Just looking for a really wonderful time
[31:17] with the Lord today. Amen.
[31:21] Why don't we sing Your Love is Life to
[31:22] Me. Maybe brother Ed can just take over
[31:26] the service after brother Ryan sings.
[31:30] Your love is life to me.
[31:36] My truest longing my deepest
[31:40] me.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you believe it?
[31:51] For your love is life to me.
[31:56] Oh,
[31:58] your love is
[32:01] me.
[32:03] My true and longing my deepest
[32:11] without you know I don't know where I
[32:18] your love is
[32:21] to me.
[32:32] God bless you all. Just a quick word
[32:34] about this song. I was um Lord was
[32:37] dealing with me once on the the phrase
[32:39] to worship in spirit and in truth. And
[32:41] as I thought about it, it's like Lord, I
[32:43] don't honestly know if I know in the
[32:45] fullness what that means. And I it kind
[32:48] of developed into a prayer. Teach me to
[32:50] worship. And the more that I thought
[32:52] about that, it just began to unfold into
[32:53] other things. Teach me to love. Teach me
[32:55] to pray. And uh then this song kind of
[32:58] ended up as a result of that. And it's
[32:59] just simply called my prayer. I hope
[33:01] it's a blessing. I believe it's
[33:02] something we all identify with.
[33:18] When in my
[33:22] daily life, you lead me into the world
[33:28] to those that need thee. and I'm
[33:32] surrounded by all those who cannot
[33:38] see.
[33:41] Give me a heart that beats as yours does
[33:46] and a life that shines with your love
[33:51] and a grace that testifies of how you
[33:56] love me as I was. And teach me to love.
[34:08] Teach me
[34:11] to love.
[34:28] And when you lead me through the valley
[34:34] and desperate need is all around me and
[34:39] I am called to stand when standing
[34:43] breaks my heart.
[34:47] Oh, let me bear my soul before you
[34:53] as I yield this vessel for you. And with
[34:58] tears stained eyes turn toward you,
[35:02] knowing you will hear my cry and teach
[35:07] me to pray.
[35:15] Teach me
[35:18] to pray.
[35:25] [Music]
[35:49] And when the
[35:53] wind and storms are blowing and I am
[35:57] filled with such a knowing and all
[36:01] around me strife and Questions fill the
[36:06] air
[36:08] [Music]
[36:09] in the midst of all the noises.
[36:14] Through the multitude of voices,
[36:18] give me faith that still rejoices.
[36:22] Then I see you in this storm and teach
[36:27] me to trust.
[36:32] Oh,
[36:34] teach me
[36:36] to trust.
[36:55] And when I humbly bow
[37:00] before you and offer all that I am to
[37:06] you and give you thanks for all you've
[37:12] done and are to do.
[37:17] Give me words for thoughts unspoken.
[37:23] Give me songs when I am broken
[37:27] and a heart that's yielded and open as I
[37:32] surrender all to you and teach me to
[37:38] worship.
[37:44] Teach me
[37:46] to worship.
[37:52] Teach me
[37:55] to worship.
[37:59] [Music]
[38:16] This is my
[38:20] prayer.
[38:21] [Music]
[38:26] [Applause]
[38:33] Why don't we stand together this morning
[38:34] as we invite our pastor to come?
[38:41] I stand and all within the presence of
[38:47] the Lord.
[38:50] In whom the wisdom of the age
[38:55] is alive.
[38:58] from whom the raging of the sea
[39:03] subsides.
[39:06] A living sacrifice.
[39:11] The only source
[39:14] of life.
[39:16] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[39:22] [Music]
[39:26] I
[39:39] forever more.
[39:47] His tender mercies come with every
[39:52] rising sun.
[39:55] to meet the sinner in his brokenness.
[40:04] offer healing and for
[40:12] those who trust me in
[40:16] Heat. Heat.
[40:20] [Applause]
[40:26] Heat. Heat.
[40:38] Oh
[40:43] forever
[40:51] is my
[41:08] My
[41:11] is
[41:15] forever more.
[41:20] Let's sing the first verse again.
[41:24] I stand in all within the presence of
[41:29] the Lord.
[41:33] In whom the wisdom of the aesthetic
[42:20] forever.
[42:23] Oh, you sing that chorus again.
[42:26] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[42:36] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[42:47] is alone
[42:51] forever more.
[42:58] It's my hope
[43:02] is in the Lord
[43:06] from this time on
[43:10] and ever more.
[43:13] Oh my home
[43:18] is in the Lord
[43:22] forever more.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Derek.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you
[43:36] &gt;&gt; for being here.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; And we thank the Lord Jesus Christ for
[43:39] all he's done. Otherwise, we couldn't be
[43:42] here.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; That's why our hope is in him.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; If your hope is in just each other or
[43:49] your family or the preacher or whatever,
[43:52] uh that'll that'll fail.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; But our hope is in him. It'll never
[43:57] fail.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a wonderful message we
[44:00] have.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful gospel.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, we're the service this
[44:10] afternoon is going to be at 4:00 because
[44:14] uh the different ones are here from they
[44:16] come from further or away perhaps
[44:19] Seattle, Tacoma and different places.
[44:22] So, we want them to be able to have a
[44:25] little extra time on their drive home.
[44:27] We certainly appreciate all the
[44:29] believers to come and appreciate you
[44:32] coming this morning.
[44:34] We believe if you've come with
[44:36] expectation then God will not disappoint
[44:38] you.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't he wonderful?
[44:44] Uh I also wanted to just say in in
[44:47] reference to uh the announcement that
[44:49] brother Derek made uh with regards to
[44:51] the giving almost every year we have
[44:54] people who give after the first of the
[44:56] year and uh uh and then would like to
[45:00] backdate the receipt and we're not
[45:02] permitted to do that. But if your giving
[45:05] takes place, I would say even up to
[45:07] Sunday the 1st because the accounting
[45:10] and so on will be making deposits after
[45:12] that. But it's preferable uh that you
[45:17] consider your giving and what you want
[45:19] to do with regards to regards to the
[45:22] congregation, your tithes and offerings
[45:25] for the operation of the church and for
[45:28] if you wish to give to missions.
[45:31] uh that's that's the only way that it
[45:33] happens. You know, we we're just a
[45:35] conduit and what the people give not
[45:38] only you here but those on the internet
[45:41] and they give towards the uh missions
[45:43] and we're able to do that. Also, I'd
[45:46] like to uh make make special notice. You
[45:50] see the building is progressing the we
[45:54] call it the school building which is
[45:55] largely what it will be used for. But I
[45:58] want you to think about as I do, I think
[46:01] about the children in the in the as as
[46:06] believers
[46:07] family. Do you know that, and
[46:10] I'll just take this moment while you're
[46:12] standing, but do you know that we have
[46:14] people coming in on a fairly regular
[46:17] basis wanting to put their children in
[46:20] this school
[46:21] because they see them out on the parking
[46:25] lot, they look at them, and I can also
[46:29] tell you, if you were not here on
[46:32] on the other night when they had the uh
[46:36] Christmas concert, certain so on
[46:40] that the inspectors were just here spent
[46:43] a whole day that's the British Columbia
[46:45] government inspectors they were here for
[46:48] a whole day in November and they've
[46:51] given us just a first class rating they
[46:55] think the school and the last time they
[46:57] were here they said we want to take your
[46:59] format and suggest it to other schools
[47:03] in other words there's other schools
[47:04] that need this you know friends even the
[47:07] just the basic fundamental strength
[47:09] that's within the message. There's other
[47:11] people who believe it but not able to
[47:13] produce it.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; It's not your strength. It's the spirit
[47:17] of God.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; And if we give ourselves to that, we
[47:21] will express that and other people will
[47:23] see it. They actually want to
[47:26] participate. They want we're not able to
[47:28] accommodate them. So the congregation
[47:30] here should be so so grateful that that
[47:33] God has put it on the hearts of people
[47:35] and uh and uh brother Terry Tatch as the
[47:40] principal and Sister Shelley working in
[47:43] the office. I don't know another
[47:45] principal in the world that drives the
[47:48] bus and picks up children and brings
[47:50] them to the school and delivers them
[47:52] home.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; I tell you I don't know. Do you know
[47:54] anybody?
[47:56] &gt;&gt; No, there's nobody. you you don't have
[47:59] uh anyone who's an educator do that kind
[48:01] of thing. That's the kind of devotion
[48:03] that I say comes with the message.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; That's the only reason people are
[48:07] consumed with that.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; And I'd say God bless the school. So,
[48:11] those of you that were in the meeting
[48:12] and and you uh committed yourself to uh
[48:16] contribute to the building, please don't
[48:19] forget that on a monthly basis because
[48:20] we're paying now every month to uh to
[48:23] have the contractor paid and and
[48:26] everything is looking fine, but we we
[48:28] need the support of the people. And
[48:30] that's what it was all based on. And
[48:32] it's a you're going to see a big
[48:34] difference the first week of of uh
[48:37] January. I understand the walls. You may
[48:39] not understand, but when the walls are
[48:42] being prepared that they're already
[48:44] poured, they're all laying down there in
[48:46] the basement and around the building.
[48:47] And there's just one more pour this next
[48:50] week. And the first week of January, all
[48:54] the walls are going up and it's just a
[48:57] uh really truly amazing. Uh and and the
[49:00] church will be able to use the facility
[49:03] there. uh all I can say is you know as
[49:06] far as my own personal vision is
[49:08] concerned I believe this thing is of God
[49:11] and there are things that I could say
[49:13] about it that I don't want to say just
[49:15] at at this time but I can tell you that
[49:18] this is what I believe in my heart I'm
[49:20] speaking now just from my heart I
[49:22] believe that there's going to be
[49:23] believers families
[49:26] all across North America will be blessed
[49:29] from the educators that will will be
[49:32] able to give the atmosphere and stream
[49:35] it right into other homes
[49:38] where children are sitting around being
[49:40] homeschooled and all the rest of it and
[49:42] they're just in a little enclave by
[49:44] themselves. Why not bring them right
[49:46] into the atmosphere? I mean, we're doing
[49:48] it right this minute.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; You're creating an atmosphere for people
[49:52] sitting by themselves. Maybe some are
[49:54] not well. They're in in in far away
[49:57] places. I know that this service right
[49:59] now is being listened to in Europe
[50:00] because it's a it's their evening time
[50:03] and they just rejoice. We get emails
[50:05] every week. The effect of it and I say
[50:09] God, let's give the message a mighty
[50:12] voice.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we say, God bless all of
[50:15] you that are streaming at this time. And
[50:18] we trust that you'll be able to say amen
[50:20] and be a part of us. And incidentally on
[50:23] on a watch night service, what the
[50:25] brothers have been working at, they say
[50:27] that I've been working hard. I can tell
[50:29] you there's other brothers, brother
[50:30] Michael, brother Darren, and brother
[50:32] Aaron, and all of these other brothers,
[50:34] brother Nathaniel
[50:36] Iverson, and these brothers been working
[50:38] very, very hard. They're going to try
[50:40] and attempt to connect. We have the we
[50:43] have things in place, but we've never
[50:45] done it before. and actually connect
[50:47] some other congregations, two or three
[50:50] of them in China
[50:52] where the where the people will be right
[50:54] there and the and the minister will be
[50:56] there and we'll be able to have two-way
[50:59] uh conversation. We want them to sing
[51:02] for you and you sing for them and why
[51:05] not?
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:07] So, whatever God has in his mind.
[51:10] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. I'd like to
[51:13] just sing a little chorus. Uh, I I just
[51:16] feel he's so wonderful. I like to sing.
[51:19] Isn't he wonderful? Wonderful.
[51:21] Wonderful. You help us out, Brother
[51:23] Derek, please. Amen. And then we're
[51:25] going to go right to the word.
[51:30] Isn't he wonderful?
[51:34] Wonderful.
[51:36] Wonderful.
[51:37] Isn't Jesus my Lord? Wonderful.
[51:44] I see
[51:52] a Jesus my wonderful
[51:59] king. Wonderful.
[52:02] Wonderful.
[52:04] Wonderful.
[52:06] Isn't Jesus my Lord? Wonderful.
[52:12] My eyes have seen my ear
[52:16] was recorded in God's word. Isn't Jesus
[52:22] my Lord wonderful?
[52:26] I'd like to sing it just one more time,
[52:28] but I'd like you to turn around and use
[52:31] you're you're saying it, so you shake
[52:33] hands with as many people as you can.
[52:35] And with that on your lips, isn't he
[52:36] wonderful? That's a good testimony to
[52:39] hold this morning. Let's greet one
[52:41] another. Isn't he wonderful?
[52:45] Wonderful.
[52:47] Wonderful.
[52:54] [Music]
[53:05] Wonderful.
[53:12] Wonderful.
[53:24] I have seen my
[53:28] reward in God's word. Isn't Jesus my
[53:33] Lord? Wonderful.
[53:38] And the people said, "Hallelujah.
[53:41] Praise the Lord." Well, now that's that
[53:44] created an atmosphere. I'm ready to
[53:46] preach.
[53:48] Amen. So nice to have brother Timothy
[53:50] Honor Tokco here with us all the way
[53:53] from Johannesburg, South Africa. But the
[53:57] families here, Sister Chantel and
[54:00] Brother Paul and Michelle, we're so
[54:02] happy to have them.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; I'd like to turn in your Bible and thank
[54:08] you for standing to Hebrews the 11th
[54:10] chapter and we're going to read a few
[54:12] verses starting with verse five.
[54:30] I would like to speak to you this
[54:33] morning on the great migration
[54:37] and for a subject
[54:40] I want to
[54:42] direct the thoughts to they seek a
[54:44] country.
[54:48] And the verse starts out verse 5, by
[54:50] faith Enoch was translated or we could
[54:54] say migrated
[54:56] because migration is to go from one
[54:58] place to another.
[55:00] So by faith Enoch was translated or he
[55:04] migrated from one place to another that
[55:06] he should not see death to a place
[55:09] that's in other words beyond death and
[55:12] was not found a place beyond the visible
[55:15] because God had translated him for
[55:18] before his translation he had this
[55:20] testimony that he pleased God. But
[55:24] without faith it is impossible to please
[55:26] him. For he that cometh to God must
[55:28] believe that he is, and that he is a
[55:31] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[55:33] him. By faith, Noah, being warned of
[55:36] God, of things not seen as yet, moved
[55:39] with fear, prepared an ark to the saving
[55:42] of his house, by the which he condemned
[55:45] the world, and became heir of the
[55:47] righteousness, which is by faith. By
[55:50] faith Abram, when he was called to go
[55:53] out into a place which he should after
[55:57] receive for an inheritance, obeyed, and
[55:59] he went out, not knowing whether he
[56:01] went, by faith he sojourned in the land
[56:04] of promise, as in a strange country,
[56:07] dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and
[56:10] Jacob, the heirs with him in the same
[56:13] promise. For he looked for a city which
[56:15] hath foundations, whose builder and
[56:18] maker is God. Through faith also Sarah
[56:22] herself received strength to conceive
[56:24] seed, and was delivered of a child when
[56:27] she was past age, because she judged him
[56:30] faithful, who had promised. Therefore
[56:33] sprang there even of one and and him as
[56:37] good as dead, as so many as the stars of
[56:40] the sky in multitude, and as the sand
[56:43] which is by the seashore innumerable.
[56:46] These all died in faith, not having
[56:49] received the promises, but having seen
[56:51] them aar off, and were persuaded of
[56:54] them, and embraced them, and confessed
[56:56] that they were strangers and pilgrims on
[56:59] the earth. For they that say such
[57:02] things, they that say such things
[57:05] declare plainly that they seek a
[57:08] country.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Let's just have a word of prayer.
[57:11] Father, this is your word.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Your Holy Spirit authored is the author
[57:17] of the word. Faithful holy prophets
[57:20] wrote and they spake as they were moved
[57:23] by the Holy Ghost. They desired to look
[57:26] into these things which we see and they
[57:28] were prevented from it. But now you have
[57:30] made them open. You have sent your
[57:32] messenger. You have revealed your word.
[57:35] You have opened the seals, oh God. You
[57:38] have made clear things which were in a
[57:41] short time ago were not clear. We're
[57:44] obscure. But you have cleared our
[57:46] vision. Oh God, we thank you for it so
[57:49] much. Bless the people from the youngest
[57:51] to the eldest in Jesus Christ's name.
[57:54] Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[58:01] The Bible
[58:04] records the movement of his children
[58:07] over the face of the earth
[58:11] in search of a permanent home.
[58:15] We can say with the songwriter, this
[58:17] world is not my home.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; I'm just traveling through. Yes. Amen.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that are
[58:24] traveling as well, but they're not
[58:26] traveling through with the same purpose
[58:28] and intent that we have. Hebrews the
[58:31] 11th chapter, and we could have read on,
[58:33] but you know the chapter well, is uh a
[58:37] record of some of those that were
[58:40] directed from one place to another. Now,
[58:44] you'll have to really lay hold of my
[58:46] thought today because it's it's it
[58:49] reaches out into a into a sphere of it
[58:53] deals with our instinct. It deals with a
[58:56] supernatural instinct. And brother
[58:58] Brandham refers to he ties faith to that
[59:02] instinct, that sixth sense. It's
[59:04] something else. It's something that the
[59:07] believer possesses. Not everyone
[59:10] possesses it. The believer possesses it.
[59:12] And I want to single uh and and and make
[59:16] that very very distinct. And uh so I
[59:19] have referred to for my own reading and
[59:22] my own study. I've seen that the 11th
[59:26] chapter of Hebrews, the Bible tells
[59:28] about how they wandered in the deserts
[59:30] and so on so forth. I just see a a uh
[59:33] humanity
[59:35] uh a movement of humanity within the sea
[59:38] of of humanity is is currents and these
[59:42] currents are moving and and and currents
[59:45] are under different influence in a in a
[59:48] river in a body of water. And now we're
[59:50] talking about a body of people and but
[59:53] there are some people that have they're
[59:56] moving they're they're being directed by
[1:00:00] a a a different uh something a different
[1:00:03] something within them a different
[1:00:05] instinct within them and uh the
[1:00:08] believers uh I want to bring that out as
[1:00:11] the believers have that now the reason
[1:00:13] for migration and we're familiar with it
[1:00:16] but the reason for migration and those
[1:00:19] of you from the continent of Africa when
[1:00:22] you have come from there.
[1:00:24] Uh it is such a wonderful wonderful
[1:00:27] continent and it is so blessed by
[1:00:30] uh the the creatures and the animals and
[1:00:33] the birds and so on and they have some
[1:00:35] of the greatest migrations and I have
[1:00:37] sat with awe as I have looked at them
[1:00:40] and I'm going to just show a few on the
[1:00:42] screen a little later on. But the
[1:00:44] marvels of the creatures that are moved
[1:00:46] by instinct, there's no one that can
[1:00:49] really fully grasp because it it it goes
[1:00:52] beyond our understanding. They do they
[1:00:55] do what seemingly is impossible humanly
[1:01:00] speaking. It's impossible. And we marvel
[1:01:02] at their at their determination to do
[1:01:05] certain things. Feats of nature which
[1:01:08] are so mysterious to us. Even though we,
[1:01:11] you know, we know everything that we
[1:01:13] have discovered about them, but all we
[1:01:16] can do is just watch them and watch them
[1:01:20] with awe. I wonder if the Bible speaks
[1:01:23] in Hebrews the 12th chapter that we are
[1:01:27] encompassed, surrounded, we are looked
[1:01:29] upon by a great host of witnesses. I
[1:01:33] wonder if some of those witnesses, if
[1:01:34] they're able to view us today, if they
[1:01:39] would look and think of the t era that
[1:01:42] they lived in in the simplicity of uh uh
[1:01:47] uh of movement by animals, by horses, by
[1:01:51] oxen, by camels and whatever more. and
[1:01:54] and they look at us today and see this
[1:01:58] mass of humanity, you know, uh hundreds
[1:02:01] of thousands in the air at any moment
[1:02:03] traveling at such speeds as the jet
[1:02:06] travel allows. And I I wonder if they
[1:02:08] look at and see the enticements and the
[1:02:11] soft living and the pressures of life.
[1:02:14] And I wonder if they just don't look
[1:02:15] upon uh this host of witnesses and look
[1:02:18] upon it with awe, seeing that there's a
[1:02:21] still a body of people holding fast to
[1:02:24] the same faith that they held to and
[1:02:27] making their way through all of these
[1:02:28] currents and all of these influences and
[1:02:31] being undeterred going whether it means
[1:02:34] life or whether it means death, I'm
[1:02:36] going to reach my objective.
[1:02:38] [Applause]
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; They do it for food. They do it for
[1:02:43] survival.
[1:02:45] They do it for reproduction. They do it
[1:02:48] for different reasons. But whatever
[1:02:50] instinct is in them, they are driven by
[1:02:53] that instinct and cannot be deterred.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; And I say, God bless God's people.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. By instinct, they migrate away
[1:03:04] from the cold of winter
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; and head directly to where there is food
[1:03:10] to sustain them. By instinct, we have
[1:03:15] moved away from the cold formality of
[1:03:19] denominations that have been established
[1:03:21] for hundreds of years. We've moved away
[1:03:23] from those denominations. We've moved
[1:03:26] away from the walls that have come
[1:03:28] crumbling down. They have not supported
[1:03:30] the people these walls of cold formal uh
[1:03:35] denominations and I we've moved away
[1:03:37] from them
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; and we've moved away from them and we
[1:03:40] have we have migrated hallelujah to
[1:03:44] another place where we found food.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Our souls were fed.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we found a sense of
[1:03:51] protection and we knew that we'd have
[1:03:54] food to take us through this famine era.
[1:03:58] Hallelujah.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; We've experienced this migration
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; by instinct. The cattle and the birds
[1:04:07] moved away as brother Brandham spoke a
[1:04:10] number of times in India where they were
[1:04:13] uh the cattle moved away from the walls.
[1:04:17] The birds moved away from their nests
[1:04:19] which they had actually, you know, they
[1:04:21] made their homes in the nest and they
[1:04:22] moved away from it and sat out in the
[1:04:25] trees out in the middle of the field and
[1:04:27] the pastures and very very hot and the
[1:04:30] and animals moved out to the middle and
[1:04:33] sat in the heat hours before maybe a day
[1:04:36] before the earthquake came. And when the
[1:04:40] earthquake came, the walls crumbled, the
[1:04:42] birds would have been crushed. Their
[1:04:44] nests were crushed. The animals would
[1:04:46] have been killed from the walls that
[1:04:48] fell down. In other words, there was a
[1:04:50] sense within those animals, which we
[1:04:52] call dumb animals. I don't call them
[1:04:54] dumb. I call them that they were very
[1:04:56] much guided.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were guided for the
[1:05:00] preservation of life to move away from
[1:05:02] those crumbling walls. And even though
[1:05:04] it even though it meant standing in the
[1:05:06] heat, though it meant doing something
[1:05:09] that wasn't pleasant, they were driven
[1:05:11] by an instinct that preserved their
[1:05:14] lives.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; And we're being driven, friends. This
[1:05:17] isn't just some uh, you know, a sloppy
[1:05:20] agopy thing. This isn't something in the
[1:05:23] emotional realm where we're just coming
[1:05:24] to church to have a nice little
[1:05:26] handshake or a a good feeling with one
[1:05:29] another. We're being driven
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; because there's a consciousness within
[1:05:33] us.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; This is life or death.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; And if it's not life or death to you,
[1:05:38] you don't understand what the situation
[1:05:40] is.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; This is a this is a matter of life or
[1:05:42] death.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; I've got a slide or two.
[1:05:58] Every year there's the reindeer up in
[1:06:02] the Arctic
[1:06:04] and uh
[1:06:07] they perform
[1:06:10] what is difficult for most any other
[1:06:13] animal.
[1:06:16] They might travel more than 5,000
[1:06:19] kilometers
[1:06:20] or 3,000 over 3,100
[1:06:24] miles
[1:06:26] in the extreme cold
[1:06:29] of the Arctic.
[1:06:46] In fact, is one of brother Brandham's
[1:06:47] dearest friends
[1:06:50] called Chris Berg. How many know of
[1:06:53] Chris Berg?
[1:06:57] He was a very dear friend of
[1:07:01] ours as our family. My wife and I have
[1:07:04] known him ever since we were children.
[1:07:07] He wasn't all that much older than
[1:07:10] myself, but when I was taking brother
[1:07:12] Brandham Hunting, he said, "Do you think
[1:07:15] we could get Brother Chris Berg to go
[1:07:17] with us?"
[1:07:19] And I said, "Uh, oh, absolutely. He'll
[1:07:21] drop everything."
[1:07:23] And he did. So, he was on the the hunts.
[1:07:28] Brother Chris Berg took a contract with
[1:07:30] the
[1:07:32] provincial government and I'll just take
[1:07:33] this back
[1:07:35] to her reindeer
[1:07:38] to her the reindeer they call her the
[1:07:40] Arctic caribou
[1:07:42] and he he took a contract for five years
[1:07:45] to herd these animals
[1:07:48] and uh the Canadian US government made a
[1:07:51] arrangement I think where the US
[1:07:52] government contributed a bunch of the
[1:07:54] animals to come over to the eastern in
[1:07:58] Arctic.
[1:08:00] Brother Chris was a man of prayer. He
[1:08:01] had never married. He had never didn't
[1:08:04] have any other responsibilities than
[1:08:07] just to serve God in the way that was
[1:08:11] available to him.
[1:08:14] When he was hurting reindeer, just one
[1:08:16] or two accounts, and you may have heard
[1:08:18] me tell this before, but there's many
[1:08:20] that perhaps and some on the internet
[1:08:22] which have not heard it. He was a man of
[1:08:25] prayer. then you have an idea why
[1:08:28] brother Brandham loved him
[1:08:30] and he was in prayer in his tent and he
[1:08:34] got so intensely in prayer but the stove
[1:08:38] pipe going through the tent he he the
[1:08:41] metal collar head was gone and so the
[1:08:45] canvas uh caught on fire and if you know
[1:08:48] anything about canvas it burned very
[1:08:50] quickly but he was so intense in intent
[1:08:54] in prayer in the tent And they have it
[1:08:57] walled up with snow around it. And he
[1:09:00] was he was he was in caught up in prayer
[1:09:03] and uh the tent burnt down just just
[1:09:06] gone. And when he came too out of his
[1:09:10] prayer he looked up and all he saw was
[1:09:12] the heavens and the stars at night and
[1:09:15] he thought, "I've crossed over."
[1:09:19] Said, "I've already crossed over." He
[1:09:21] didn't realize that the tent had burned
[1:09:22] down around him. I tell you it's it's a
[1:09:25] it's wonderful to get locked into prayer
[1:09:27] like that. I had one more experience and
[1:09:29] I because I I don't want to go on with
[1:09:31] these accounts but these are true
[1:09:33] accounts and I think why the prophet
[1:09:34] loved him is uh he was there for 5 years
[1:09:40] and he witnessed all he did was witness
[1:09:42] and pray. He just witness and tell
[1:09:44] people with such in earnestness and
[1:09:47] sincerity that they need to love Jesus
[1:09:49] and they need to be saved and and he
[1:09:51] would just tell them everything that he
[1:09:53] knew. He never saw one soul saved.
[1:09:57] Sometime later after he'd been there 5
[1:10:00] years, we had a a missionary to the
[1:10:03] Eskimo people, Inuit they call now, and
[1:10:06] they he was at our church and he said to
[1:10:10] me, "Do you know Chris Berg?" I said,
[1:10:12] "Yes, of course. When he's here, he
[1:10:15] comes here to this church." Oh, he said,
[1:10:19] he said, "There's been a sweep." And
[1:10:20] they had the pictures and showed
[1:10:22] pictures of the Arctic and they had a
[1:10:24] revival amongst the Inuit people. And he
[1:10:27] said, "You when you're just up speaking,
[1:10:30] they would come and they would run down
[1:10:32] and tears streaming down their face and
[1:10:35] give their lives to Christ. The Holy
[1:10:37] Spirit came on them and swept over the
[1:10:39] whole Arctic.
[1:10:41] This man flew a Sessional 180 plane and
[1:10:44] would land where the where the Inuit
[1:10:46] were because they would travel with a
[1:10:47] caribou. And he would and he said he
[1:10:50] said as soon as they got up and God had
[1:10:54] brought salvation to them, they'd say,
[1:10:56] "Where's Chris Berg?
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; He's the one who told us about this."
[1:11:00] And he said it was because that man's
[1:11:02] witness
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; over the whole Arctic in five years that
[1:11:06] God poured out his spirit upon the whole
[1:11:08] place. One man. Hallelujah. Can we say
[1:11:11] praise be to God?
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; And God hears your witness.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where you are, you don't
[1:11:16] know the effect of it. You might not
[1:11:18] even be around when the effect happens,
[1:11:20] but it will surely happen.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; And that was his testimony.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Five years. Never saw a soul saved. But
[1:11:31] I tell you what, he became a friend of
[1:11:33] the prophet of God.
[1:11:39] They say also
[1:11:42] every year
[1:11:44] there's a a million wilderbeast
[1:11:48] in the Serengeti.
[1:11:51] And uh these wilderbeast they migrate
[1:11:54] from the southern Serengeti in search of
[1:11:56] grass and water that they need to
[1:11:59] survive. And they will travel 2,000
[1:12:02] miles
[1:12:04] devouring 4,000 tons of grass a day.
[1:12:09] But when you see them jumping into that
[1:12:10] river, and I have seen, if you have an
[1:12:13] opportunity to see it at IMAX, you see
[1:12:16] some that aren't making it. They're not
[1:12:19] making it, but they died trying.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; That's a big difference, friends. There
[1:12:24] are those that have died in the faith.
[1:12:26] There are those that have laid down, and
[1:12:28] some of them died at an early age. They
[1:12:31] burned out their life for God. But I can
[1:12:33] tell you that at the great gathering,
[1:12:35] they'll be there.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at them.
[1:12:43] Brother Brandham said, "God has so
[1:12:44] provided." He spoke of the horses as an
[1:12:48] instinct. Horses has an instinct. They
[1:12:51] can smell storms
[1:12:54] for miles away.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; He said another time, he said, "You find
[1:12:59] you read in the newspaper the weather
[1:13:01] forecasters and they say beautiful
[1:13:04] weather in the next few days." He says,
[1:13:06] "If you have a a a s hog, just a pig,
[1:13:11] and she getting her the corn husks from
[1:13:15] the north side of the hill and bringing
[1:13:18] them around to the south side and making
[1:13:21] her bed on the south side." He said,
[1:13:23] "Don't you believe the newspaper. You
[1:13:25] believe that hog."
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Do I need to say that again?
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:43] These are butterflies.
[1:13:46] Monarch butterflies.
[1:13:53] They come from way up in northern part
[1:13:55] of Canada
[1:13:58] and they fly
[1:14:00] all the way down to southern California
[1:14:04] to around Mterrey and fly down into
[1:14:07] Mexico.
[1:14:09] Their wings are 4 in across.
[1:14:12] And now here's a absolutely amazing
[1:14:15] thing which I didn't know until I just
[1:14:17] began to read a wee bit about them.
[1:14:20] But they spend their summers in the
[1:14:22] Great Lakes
[1:14:24] and uh and in the fall they migrate
[1:14:27] southern California, Mexico and even
[1:14:29] into Florida.
[1:14:31] Uh on route the same trees on route the
[1:14:36] same trees are chosen as resting places
[1:14:40] every year.
[1:14:42] And of course, none of the insects
[1:14:46] uh none of the insects have seen these
[1:14:48] trees before. That's right.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; It's in the genes, folks.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; And they rest on the same trees. And yet
[1:14:59] they land and mass
[1:15:02] on the same branches generation after
[1:15:04] generation, migration after migration.
[1:15:10] And down in California, they they rest
[1:15:13] at the same place and they only feed on
[1:15:15] one weed called the milkweed. That's
[1:15:18] their food.
[1:15:20] And because of the cycle of life, some
[1:15:23] of them because they some of them do not
[1:15:27] make this trip. And then the young ones
[1:15:30] are born and the young ones fly exactly
[1:15:33] the same place, land on precisely the
[1:15:37] same trees and rest at the and and and
[1:15:40] go to the same place for the for the
[1:15:42] winter to come back. Now this is this is
[1:15:46] the uh some of the migration
[1:15:51] and he said by and large these are the
[1:15:54] ones destined for the round trip south
[1:15:58] once more without leaders and without
[1:16:01] any prior experience
[1:16:03] millions of monarch butterflies will
[1:16:06] make their way south toward their
[1:16:08] Pacific Grove winter sanctuary year
[1:16:12] after year instinct draws them back to
[1:16:16] the identical trees where their
[1:16:19] ancestors passed previous winters.
[1:16:24] Isn't it amazing?
[1:16:29] They were saying also about instinct.
[1:16:31] I'm just taking a few minutes. They were
[1:16:34] saying also about instinct that We'll
[1:16:37] just shut those off now, please. Thank
[1:16:39] you.
[1:16:44] this instinct that these creatures have
[1:16:47] and so many of them have it
[1:16:50] and I related that to uh the people but
[1:16:55] they were they brought the honeybee
[1:16:59] uh what he does by instinct what they do
[1:17:02] by instinct
[1:17:03] and they spoke about the marbles they
[1:17:05] were speaking about what is instinct
[1:17:08] and we have it as humans, but we don't
[1:17:13] understand it. Perhaps we don't
[1:17:14] understand it in the creatures. And they
[1:17:17] said that some creatures, there's all
[1:17:20] kinds of ants and termites and all kinds
[1:17:23] of creatures that migrate. They have
[1:17:26] incredible migration and go incredible
[1:17:29] distances and expend unindescribable
[1:17:33] energy and strength and do it for
[1:17:36] survival for different reasons, but
[1:17:38] mostly having to do with food, having to
[1:17:40] do with protection, having to do with
[1:17:42] the create their their uh reprodu
[1:17:45] reproduction of others and and that
[1:17:48] drives them just uh uh it indescribable.
[1:17:52] So they scientists say, well, it seems
[1:17:55] that some of them are pre-programmed and
[1:17:58] they can't do anything else because
[1:18:00] that's what's programmed within them.
[1:18:02] But they say there are others that that
[1:18:04] certainly have a degree of of of
[1:18:08] knowledge because they can actually make
[1:18:11] some decisions and they have decision
[1:18:14] making uh uh abilities. And here we are
[1:18:18] as humans. And now I'm going to go into
[1:18:23] the message now with that as a
[1:18:25] background because brother Brandham even
[1:18:28] says that the Holy Spirit
[1:18:31] put it in the animals.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Now just to give you a bit of
[1:18:35] understanding.
[1:18:38] Follow this real close. The Bible says
[1:18:41] this is going to come to you sideways.
[1:18:43] The Bible says as it was in the days of
[1:18:46] Noah.
[1:18:49] Now what actually happened in the days
[1:18:51] of Noah? A preacher preached for 120
[1:18:54] years. He was not a very successful man.
[1:18:59] After preaching for 120 years by the by
[1:19:02] the standards of the world. After
[1:19:05] preaching for 120 years, he had eight
[1:19:07] souls
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; in the ark.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; That was a wicked time.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, friends, Jesus said
[1:19:16] as it was. And I can tell you it's a
[1:19:18] wicked time. Yes, sir.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; We're sitting here in a congregation. I
[1:19:23] want to say to you young people, you're
[1:19:24] living in a very vile, wicked time.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; It's unclean. It's unclean as it can be.
[1:19:31] And I want you to look deep within
[1:19:33] yourself and and ask yourself, do I have
[1:19:37] something? Why am I here? Why am I in
[1:19:40] this service? Is there something deep
[1:19:42] within that speaks to me? Is there
[1:19:44] something? Brother Brandham says, "I
[1:19:46] love nature." Because he saw God. I just
[1:19:49] wasn't showing you some pictures of some
[1:19:51] creatures, but he saw God in the
[1:19:54] animals. He saw God in the universe. And
[1:19:57] when we look to the heavens and when we
[1:19:59] look and see these things, even these
[1:20:00] few little slides today, I'm not trying
[1:20:02] to describe what what what possesses
[1:20:05] these animals, but it's good for us to
[1:20:07] look at them and say, "That's God in his
[1:20:10] creation. That's God in his universe.
[1:20:13] This is God in his word. And this is God
[1:20:16] that has come in flesh today. God has
[1:20:19] sent his God has sent his word. The God
[1:20:21] that sent his word and made all of these
[1:20:23] things. The God that even put the
[1:20:25] instinct within these creatures. What
[1:20:28] What has he done for man made in his
[1:20:30] image? What kind of instinct do we have?
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; For the scripture says, "For the
[1:20:38] invisible things of him from the
[1:20:40] creation of the world are clearly seen
[1:20:43] being understood by the things that are
[1:20:45] made, even his eternal power and
[1:20:48] godhead. So that they are without
[1:20:50] excuse." God is saying the world is
[1:20:51] without excuse because God is visible in
[1:20:54] creation.
[1:20:56] And he said, "Because that when they
[1:20:58] knew God, they glorified him not as God,
[1:21:00] neither were thankful, but became vain
[1:21:03] in their imaginations, and their foolish
[1:21:05] heart was darkened." Amen.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; I I want you to ask yourself the animals
[1:21:11] that came into the ark. God said to
[1:21:14] Noah, "You will take two of every
[1:21:18] creature and and and seven of the clean,
[1:21:22] but two of
[1:21:24] of all the creatures of all the animals
[1:21:29] and creatures that went into the ark. I
[1:21:33] want you to ask yourself this morning,
[1:21:35] what was it that caused the two
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; of all of them, all of the species were
[1:21:42] there. Perhaps thousands and thousands
[1:21:44] of them, but two,
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; something spoke to two.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says they came and they
[1:21:52] came to Noah.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; What What drove them to Noah?
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; What caused them to come to Noah?
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; He had the word
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; to preserve them.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; And God had a greater plan to preserve
[1:22:08] the creatures
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; and they must come out into a new world.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; And the seven the seven the seven of the
[1:22:16] others
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; and they came to Noah. Seven came to
[1:22:19] Noah.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Seven walked into the ark. They were
[1:22:22] driven to go. Something was in them.
[1:22:25] Something motivated them. They were
[1:22:27] listening to an inner voice. And that
[1:22:30] inner voice was going to take them out
[1:22:31] into a new world. They're going to walk
[1:22:34] out of the ark one day.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there's been something
[1:22:38] that's driven us into the ark. Christ
[1:22:40] the word.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; We're not here because, you know, we
[1:22:44] just have a certain appetite for it.
[1:22:46] We're here because it it answers to
[1:22:48] something within us.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; And we find there our food. We find
[1:22:52] there our preservation. We find our
[1:22:55] protection.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; We find what satisfies us.
[1:23:01] Hallelujah.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; When you were first converted,
[1:23:10] the prophet said, "And show us the
[1:23:13] father." He said, "You remember when you
[1:23:16] were first converted,
[1:23:19] how different things looked. The trees
[1:23:22] looked different.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; The birds sounded different than they
[1:23:26] ever had before." He said, "God had just
[1:23:28] come in here."
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; And God speaking out in his universe.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; You just got converted. You just got
[1:23:36] into a different location. You got into
[1:23:39] a different sphere and everything looked
[1:23:42] different and things sounded different.
[1:23:44] It was because God had come into you
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; and God in that nature and God in
[1:23:50] creation started to mean something
[1:23:52] different to you. If you haven't
[1:23:54] experienced that, I hope that you will.
[1:23:56] He said, "How I love to watch him in his
[1:23:58] nature." How, and that's a prophet. If
[1:24:01] he loved to watch it in nature, how much
[1:24:02] more even we should, God, how he
[1:24:05] provides things. These little ducks come
[1:24:08] up from the north down south and go
[1:24:11] there and make their nests on this lake.
[1:24:13] He said the little ducks are raised
[1:24:15] there. They're hatched out. And in
[1:24:18] September gets cold, the first breeze
[1:24:20] comes down across the mountains and
[1:24:22] there's real cold breeze. He says,
[1:24:24] "Well, those little ducks." He says,
[1:24:26] "Now, he has never left that lake."
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; He was born there. He has never left
[1:24:33] that lake. And he says the first cold
[1:24:36] breeze, and I know what I'm talking
[1:24:37] about. I have been up in the north,
[1:24:39] lived so much of my life there. And that
[1:24:41] first cold breeze just goes by like
[1:24:44] that. He says that little Drake,
[1:24:51] he'll put his bill up in the air.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Smell that? He said he'll give a few
[1:24:56] honks and all the other ducks, ducks on
[1:24:59] the lake will just come right gathering
[1:25:02] around him because he's a leader
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; and he knows that he knows that winter's
[1:25:07] coming. And he says he'll lift up off
[1:25:09] that lake and fly as straight as can be
[1:25:11] right to Louisiana or down to the rice
[1:25:14] fields in Texas. What is it that caused
[1:25:16] him to do it? What is it in him?
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; And this great leader of the Holy Spirit
[1:25:23] that that gave the word of God and and
[1:25:26] and and so some people hear the prophet
[1:25:28] and he's just another preacher. Some
[1:25:30] people heard Jesus Christ and he was
[1:25:32] just a great teacher. He's a great man.
[1:25:34] But to another one, he said, "You have
[1:25:37] the words of eternal life."
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's a different sound. I
[1:25:42] hear a different sound, friends. Glory
[1:25:44] to God. This message, I'm consumed with
[1:25:47] this message. It's a different sound.
[1:25:49] It's not just some other teaching. It's
[1:25:51] not some just some other doctrine. It's
[1:25:54] a different sound. It's speaking to an
[1:25:56] instinct. And I know that that instinct
[1:25:58] is going to guide us because it's the
[1:26:00] Holy Spirit guiding you
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; from here
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; to a new world.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Behold, I make all things new. That
[1:26:10] instinct that's in you is guiding you to
[1:26:12] that place
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; where he who put the instinct there
[1:26:16] says, I have created all things new. Oh,
[1:26:19] what a place. We don't want to miss that
[1:26:21] one.
[1:26:23] Thank you, Lord.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; He says it's God working in his nature,
[1:26:29] working among his animals. And if you
[1:26:32] can give a d give a duck enough sense to
[1:26:34] know how to get out of the cold weather,
[1:26:37] what ought it do to a man that's born
[1:26:39] again of the spirit of God?
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; A woman born of the spirit of God.
[1:26:47] Yeah.
[1:26:48] I
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; tell you kids,
[1:26:52] there's a lot out there.
[1:26:55] Every demon force, every enticement,
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; every kind of pleasure, every kind of
[1:27:01] thing that will appeal, if you lean for
[1:27:04] a moment to the world or the things of
[1:27:07] the world, if you lean for a moment just
[1:27:09] to what makes you feel good or or what
[1:27:12] will make life better for you, it'll
[1:27:14] guide you in a wrong direction.
[1:27:16] But you listen to that instinct. You
[1:27:18] listen to that voice. You listen to the
[1:27:20] sound that God sent.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "When they leave northern
[1:27:25] British Columbia," speaking in a super
[1:27:27] sign in ' 63, he says, "I hear those
[1:27:30] geese going over screaming the way they
[1:27:32] go going south." He said, "I can listen
[1:27:35] to them and cry because I see God
[1:27:38] guiding them." He said, "What what
[1:27:41] guides them through the pathless air?
[1:27:44] What guides them? They've never been
[1:27:45] that way before. What guides them
[1:27:47] through the pathless air? They know
[1:27:49] precisely where they're going. He said
[1:27:52] some kind of instinct draws them
[1:27:54] together and they get together and swarm
[1:27:57] before they fly and before they go
[1:28:00] south. What is it? He said it's a
[1:28:02] revival time. I wonder what it is that
[1:28:05] has gathered people around this message.
[1:28:08] I can tell you friends uh I I I got
[1:28:11] another message. I don't want to get on
[1:28:13] to it, but I hear another voice.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; We've heard the voice of the shout.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; A lot of people heard brother Brandham
[1:28:23] preached, but only some of all the
[1:28:26] masses. We're We were guided into the
[1:28:29] ark.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Because it's been ordained to step out
[1:28:35] into a new world.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil trap you. Don't let
[1:28:40] the devil deaden that instinct or cover
[1:28:42] it over. You listen to that instinct.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't want to be on down
[1:28:48] the road and say, "I should have
[1:28:49] listened." You want to be up there and
[1:28:51] say, "I'm glad I listened."
[1:28:54] [Applause]
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Now I want to speak about 11th chapter
[1:29:06] of Hebrews. Enoch.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; He migrated from one place to another.
[1:29:13] And the Bible says, now we're talking
[1:29:15] about this migration.
[1:29:18] The Bible says that by faith Enoch was
[1:29:21] translated, but before he was
[1:29:23] translated,
[1:29:25] he had this testimony
[1:29:27] that he pleased God. And I asked myself
[1:29:30] and want to ask you why did he why did
[1:29:33] he do that? Why did he please God? It
[1:29:36] wasn't because it was easy. It was
[1:29:38] because he had an instinct within him. I
[1:29:40] want to please God. I want to walk with
[1:29:44] God.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Listen to that voice, friends. Listen to
[1:29:47] that voice. I want to walk with God.
[1:29:50] Forget every other voice. Listen to that
[1:29:53] voice and just do what that voice tells
[1:29:54] you to do. Don't do what the world or
[1:29:56] anything else. Don't listen. and don't
[1:29:58] be moved by the pressures of this life.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Satan's got lots of pressure.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; And then Noah, following the flood,
[1:30:08] following the flood, the earth began to
[1:30:10] be populated through the three sons of
[1:30:13] Noah, Sham, Ham, and Japheth.
[1:30:17] And brother Brandham said there's only
[1:30:19] three nationalities of people in the
[1:30:21] world, three classes. Ham, Sham, and
[1:30:23] Japheth. Ham, Shem, and Japheth. The
[1:30:26] whole human race. this side of the flood
[1:30:28] came from them. You believe that? The
[1:30:31] countries we lived in changed our
[1:30:34] colors. Black, white, brown, yellow,
[1:30:37] whatever color that has nothing to do
[1:30:39] with it. We come from we come from three
[1:30:42] children. And that's Jew, Gentile, and
[1:30:45] Samaritans. And I think of uh when
[1:30:48] brother Brandham was uh
[1:30:52] now just please c catch this
[1:30:56] when he talked about Jesus revealing the
[1:30:59] secret of the heart and it goes to the
[1:31:01] woman at the well. She was a Samaritan
[1:31:04] and brother Brandham said
[1:31:07] Jesus did and he demonstrated this
[1:31:09] revealing the secret of the heart to the
[1:31:12] Jew and the Samaritan. Amen.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; He never did do it to a gentile until
[1:31:19] this day.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; And now he leaves Luke 17:30
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; in the day when the son of man will be
[1:31:27] revealed. He reserves that for this
[1:31:30] time. And he sends one messenger,
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; one leader.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One leader and pours through
[1:31:37] him the same spirit that was in Jesus
[1:31:40] Christ. And he comes with even the same
[1:31:43] characteristics. He came out of poverty.
[1:31:46] He came out of being not known by
[1:31:49] anyone. He came on the scene doing
[1:31:51] miracles, doing the impossible. And
[1:31:55] that's precisely the same pattern. Why
[1:31:58] is it? Because Jesus, I'll come to it in
[1:32:00] a few moments. He came on the scene to
[1:32:04] an institute to initiate a a migration.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. This message came to initiate
[1:32:12] another migration.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; When Jesus was here, I call it the first
[1:32:17] phase of the epic journey. And now in
[1:32:20] this day, it's the final phase of this
[1:32:23] epic journey from this world to a new
[1:32:26] world. Hallelujah.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; By a Holy Ghost instinct, by a faith.
[1:32:32] Hallelujah. It's in our genes.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's in our genes.
[1:32:39] Yes, sir.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; He says, "Here's the spirit of God
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; in God's provided way." He said, "Now,
[1:32:49] here's here's the spirit of God in the
[1:32:53] animal life
[1:32:55] brought the animals into the ark. The
[1:32:57] spirit of God on the animal life brought
[1:33:01] the animals into the ark. And how much
[1:33:03] more ought the Holy Ghost to men and
[1:33:06] women today who believe God, who hear
[1:33:08] the scriptures, people who think of the
[1:33:10] Holy Spirit, oh, I got filled with the
[1:33:12] Holy Spirit and
[1:33:14] it's so far beyond that. It's so far
[1:33:17] beyond a feeling and a chill down my
[1:33:18] back and and all these little trinket
[1:33:21] signs. It's way beyond that, friend. The
[1:33:24] Holy Spirit we got in this day came
[1:33:26] said, "I'm the author of this word. I'm
[1:33:28] the one who's revealing this word." And
[1:33:31] the instinct within you says, "I want to
[1:33:33] understand that."
[1:33:36] [Music]
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; We're not we're not satisfied to take a
[1:33:40] casual look at it.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; It is this very word that's going to
[1:33:48] move you,
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; going to protect you, going to feed you,
[1:33:52] and going to see that you succeed in
[1:33:54] your journey. Amen.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; You might get hurt and wounded along the
[1:33:58] way,
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; but if you listen to that inner voice of
[1:34:01] the Holy Ghost, you'll make it.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; If you listen to this voice and that
[1:34:05] voice and the other voice, do you hear
[1:34:06] me? If you listen to that voice, this
[1:34:08] voice, and another voice, there's all
[1:34:10] kinds of voices. And the prophet said,
[1:34:12] "There's so many voices in the world
[1:34:14] that it will dull
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; the true voice of God." I'm interested
[1:34:19] in the true voice of God. And the only
[1:34:21] assurance I have of the true voice is
[1:34:23] God came in behind it
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; and vindicated it.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; And that's the voice.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Among all the animal life, there were a
[1:34:39] few that were elected
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; to go into the ark.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; And our ark is Christ. There's a few
[1:34:46] that are elected to go into the ark. I
[1:34:49] can't answer for everybody else. And the
[1:34:51] Bible says Genesis 7:9,
[1:34:54] there went in two and two unto Noah into
[1:34:58] the ark.
[1:35:01] Two and two
[1:35:04] of all the masses.
[1:35:06] They went into the ark. They went in
[1:35:08] unto Noah, the one who had received the
[1:35:12] message of the day.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:16] male and female as God commanded Noah.
[1:35:22] The Bible tells us a little further in
[1:35:25] this migration of humanity.
[1:35:28] And the whole earth
[1:35:31] was of one language when they came out
[1:35:34] into the new world,
[1:35:36] another part of it. And they were of one
[1:35:39] speech. And it came to pass as they
[1:35:41] journeyed from the east that they found
[1:35:43] a plain in the land of Shinar, and they
[1:35:46] dwelt there. And they said,
[1:35:50] "Go to let us build a city and a tower
[1:35:54] whose top may reach into heaven, and let
[1:35:58] us make a name,
[1:36:01] lest we be scattered abroad upon the
[1:36:06] face of the earth." So they had within
[1:36:08] their own mind, let us prepare ourselves
[1:36:13] so that we're not scattered. We're not
[1:36:15] sent into some kind of a migration
[1:36:19] over upon the face of the whole earth.
[1:36:21] And so let us go down. And God said,
[1:36:24] "Let us go down there and confound their
[1:36:26] language that they may not understand
[1:36:28] one another's speech." It's really
[1:36:30] amazing how God, he didn't take them by
[1:36:32] force to change uh their program. He
[1:36:36] just changed their language so they
[1:36:38] couldn't understand one another and they
[1:36:39] got a they got a babble out of it and
[1:36:42] then and that scattered them. And the
[1:36:44] Bible says, "So the Lord the Lord
[1:36:47] scattered them abroad from fence upon
[1:36:49] the face of the earth and they left off
[1:36:51] to build the city these that built a
[1:36:55] city and a tower of Babel, lest we be
[1:36:58] scattered abroad over the face of the
[1:37:00] earth." And so the Lord scattered them.
[1:37:03] And God God commenced another migration.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; And the families of Shem, Ham, and
[1:37:12] Japheth began to migrate in different
[1:37:15] directions. And God was the initiator of
[1:37:19] that migration.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; A migration of humankind
[1:37:29] over the face of the earth. I just want
[1:37:30] you to see this sweeping, this movement.
[1:37:34] Then we move on quickly
[1:37:37] and the Bible says by faith Abraham was
[1:37:40] called. Now we've got people over the
[1:37:42] face of the whole earth
[1:37:45] as a result of the after the flood. But
[1:37:47] now we have Abraham. And when he was
[1:37:49] called to go out, one man
[1:37:53] he was called to migrate,
[1:37:56] one man into a place that he should
[1:37:59] after receive for an inheritance. He
[1:38:02] obeyed and he went out.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Not knowing whether he went,
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; he was being guided.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; By some force,
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; by some instinct, but he'd heard the
[1:38:15] voice of God. leave your place and go
[1:38:18] out.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said it was
[1:38:21] difficult for him. He was comfortable.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; You know, we have our homes. You have
[1:38:26] your homes, you have your friends, you
[1:38:27] have your families.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; And now God by the word of God,
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Abraham is being called to go out and to
[1:38:35] leave his comfort zone
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; to a place that I will show you.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; So that was his faith. I've heard it.
[1:38:42] I'm listening to it. I don't know where
[1:38:44] this message is going to end up. I don't
[1:38:46] know where it's going to take me, but
[1:38:47] I've heard it and I'm going to follow
[1:38:49] it.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; It may cost me my friends. It may cost
[1:38:53] me my family. It may cost me a lot of
[1:38:56] things, but this is what the vindicated
[1:38:58] word is said.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to stand with it.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; It'll never be popular. Right.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says
[1:39:11] he went out not knowing whether he went
[1:39:13] and by faith he sojourned.
[1:39:15] He sojourned in a land of promise as in
[1:39:18] a strange country dwelling in
[1:39:21] tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob
[1:39:24] and the heirs with him of the same
[1:39:27] promise. For he looked for a city which
[1:39:30] had foundations whose builder and maker
[1:39:33] was God. So now he's he's he's he's in a
[1:39:37] state of uh of wandering as it were, but
[1:39:40] he's being guided and he goes from one
[1:39:42] place and if you read the life of
[1:39:43] Abraham, it will say that God met him
[1:39:46] and God spoke to him and he built an
[1:39:47] altar and he was a great altar builder,
[1:39:50] but he's in a constant migration. He's
[1:39:52] migrating. He's not found his resting
[1:39:55] place yet. And he keeps going uh in in
[1:39:59] this uh being driven. And and so I say
[1:40:02] from the time of Abraham, from the time
[1:40:04] of Abraham, the world could never be the
[1:40:08] same because God, are you listening? God
[1:40:12] was introducing a faith seed
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; in the midst of that migration.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He saw in this man a certain
[1:40:21] quality, a a quality of faith that would
[1:40:25] become a friend of God. and he entered
[1:40:27] and a faith seed entered into the human
[1:40:30] scene. And this would change the whole
[1:40:33] dimension of human life from that time
[1:40:36] forward. And we're sitting here today.
[1:40:38] Listen folks, you're not just sitting
[1:40:40] here in Cloverdale Bible Way. You're
[1:40:42] either sitting here as a member of the
[1:40:44] faith seed.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; And Abraham is your father in the faith.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Are you connected?
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Then I want to say to you, what was in
[1:40:54] him is in his kids. What was in him is
[1:40:57] in the genes,
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; faith genes, supernatural genes
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; brought down by God himself.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; And the two seeds,
[1:41:10] two seeds or two streams of life began
[1:41:13] flowing out now
[1:41:16] from Abraham.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; He's got a natural seed.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Even after Sarah was gone, he remarried
[1:41:24] and had several children. He's got a
[1:41:26] natural seed. He's got natural children,
[1:41:30] but he has a faith seed. And brother
[1:41:32] Brandham is very specific. And Apostle
[1:41:34] Paul is very specific. He does not he
[1:41:37] does not say and to thy seeds plural,
[1:41:40] but to thy seed singular.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; It was a seed. And it's it and and it
[1:41:47] was going to move down. In other words,
[1:41:49] what's in you is going to be passed on
[1:41:51] to Isaac,
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; thy son. He says, "Take thy son, thy
[1:41:54] only begotten son." And he had Ishmael.
[1:41:58] He had other children. But take because
[1:42:01] that son was a son of promise. That son
[1:42:05] was a promise was a son of the word.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; You want to be able to say to yourself
[1:42:12] while you're sitting here, I am here
[1:42:15] because of the word.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; I'm not here because there's a nice
[1:42:18] church. I'm not here because of the
[1:42:20] music. I'm not here because of a certain
[1:42:22] preacher. I'm here because the word is
[1:42:25] here. It's being preached in its
[1:42:27] undiluted form. And what's in me answers
[1:42:30] to that word.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; That's an instinct.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; And if we don't have that, that instinct
[1:42:39] is what's going to carry you from this
[1:42:41] place to another place.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; This building's going to be nothing but
[1:42:46] ashes.
[1:42:49] And I say as the prophet said, taking
[1:42:51] the words from the song, "What then?"
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; When this is all gone, what then?
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; When friends are gone,
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; what then?
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; When families are no more than teaspoons
[1:43:08] of ashes
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; in a grave, what then?
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; You want to be able to say, "I'm of
[1:43:14] Abraham.
[1:43:16] I'm in the faith of the fathers.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have been returned back to
[1:43:21] the faith of the fathers.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; And then I will be in the bosom of God
[1:43:26] who sent me here.
[1:43:28] [Music]
[1:43:34] Amen.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; God does not say
[1:43:39] that his seed will be better than
[1:43:41] others,
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; but that they will be different.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; He doesn't say your seed will be better
[1:43:48] than all the other s all the other
[1:43:50] people,
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; but they will be different.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; They'll react different.
[1:43:56] And God said, "Between me and thee."
[1:43:59] Those are the two main words, "Me and
[1:44:02] thee."
[1:44:03] Between me and thee and thy seed,
[1:44:06] singular after thee. Genesis 12:1 17-7.
[1:44:10] And I will establish my covenant between
[1:44:13] me and thee and thy seed after thee.
[1:44:17] Listen friends, I'm not talking about
[1:44:19] something that is historical. How long
[1:44:21] have the wilderbeast been doing this?
[1:44:24] How long has a monarch butterfly been
[1:44:26] doing this?
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; They've been doing this for centuries.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; They did it long before you and I were
[1:44:33] here. And if time will go on, they'll
[1:44:35] continue long after you and I are gone.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; That's how important we are. But after
[1:44:42] we're gone from here, I plan to go
[1:44:45] either in the faith or in the rapture.
[1:44:48] One of the two.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; And I will establish my covenant between
[1:45:00] me, he said, God,
[1:45:03] and thee, and thy seed after thee.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; As long as that seed would continue, thy
[1:45:10] seed singular faith seed after thee. The
[1:45:15] messenger, the last verse, the last
[1:45:18] chapter and the last verses of this Old
[1:45:21] Testament, the word of God says that he
[1:45:24] will send Elijah the prophet to turn the
[1:45:27] hearts of the children. Here we are.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Back to the faith of the fathers.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To thee and thy seed after
[1:45:37] thee. Here we are. We're the after thee.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I have made my covenant,
[1:45:44] God said, between me and thee, Abraham,
[1:45:48] and your seed after thee. We're the seed
[1:45:52] after thee. We've been in a a great
[1:45:54] migration.
[1:45:56] [Music]
[1:46:05] flowing out
[1:46:08] and the seed of brother Brandham says
[1:46:10] the seed is not in in the message the
[1:46:12] seed is not the shock will not be heir
[1:46:15] with the shock he said here this seed
[1:46:18] one one seed not seeds but one seed
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; these others were not seed of Abraham
[1:46:26] because Abraham's seed was his faith
[1:46:29] seed that God was speaking of not his
[1:46:32] natural seed seed. And so we have a
[1:46:35] natural seed. We've got populations of
[1:46:39] people in the earth. If you would raise
[1:46:42] up and perhaps see it through God's
[1:46:44] eyes, you'd see masses of humanity.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; And they all have their own little world
[1:46:52] that they live in. They all have their
[1:46:54] own struggles. They all have their own
[1:46:56] concerns.
[1:47:00] They have their own battles. They have
[1:47:01] their own temptations.
[1:47:04] They have their own ambitions.
[1:47:08] They love their children like we love
[1:47:10] ours.
[1:47:13] The world is just a mass of humanity
[1:47:15] just moving like constant moving over
[1:47:19] the face of the earth.
[1:47:23] But in that stream of humanity,
[1:47:27] there's a current
[1:47:30] of eternal life.
[1:47:32] And God has promised and given covenant
[1:47:35] to not only Abraham, but he's promised
[1:47:37] to himself.
[1:47:39] Some of that down there is my children.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; And it's not just this flesh and blood.
[1:47:46] It's not that. It is the faith seed.
[1:47:49] Some down there believe me.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; And and
[1:48:02] God says to Abraham, And he said unto
[1:48:05] Abram, is this all right?
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; He said unto Abraham, know of
[1:48:11] assurityity
[1:48:13] that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
[1:48:16] land that is not theirs, and shall serve
[1:48:19] them, and they shall afflict them 400
[1:48:22] years. and also that nation whom they
[1:48:25] shall serve will I judge. And afterward
[1:48:28] shall they come out with great
[1:48:32] substance. In the same day the Lord made
[1:48:35] a covenant with Abraham, saying, Unto
[1:48:37] thee unto thy seed have I given you this
[1:48:40] land from the river of Egypt under the
[1:48:44] great river, the river Euphrates.
[1:48:47] And now something else is taking place
[1:48:50] here. And this is why I really need you
[1:48:52] to follow with me very very close. It's
[1:48:55] a it's a lesson to the young people. If
[1:48:57] you can remember, I'm I'm going in a
[1:48:59] sequence. I'm going in continuity. Now,
[1:49:03] we've gone through the the migration
[1:49:08] after the flood
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; to the time of Abraham and then another
[1:49:12] part. And now he has his seed. And and
[1:49:17] and then the days of Lot, which I
[1:49:19] mentioned last Sunday, and the children
[1:49:22] of these two men, the nephew and his
[1:49:26] uncle, and their families begin to go in
[1:49:29] different directions. It went before the
[1:49:31] days of Lot, the days of Sodom. Actually
[1:49:34] started before the days of Sodom. There
[1:49:36] was uh there was distress in the family.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Have we had distresses in families?
[1:49:42] Yeah.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; And there was a distress in the family
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; and it was so severe that it it it
[1:49:50] rippled out to the workers and the
[1:49:52] servants and the employees,
[1:49:55] the shepherd people
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; and they began to, you know, struggle
[1:49:59] between themselves. And so Abraham, he
[1:50:03] says this, Lot,
[1:50:07] if you go this way,
[1:50:10] if you migrate this way, I'll migrate
[1:50:13] this way. If you say I will go this way,
[1:50:17] then I will go this way,
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; and you can choose first.
[1:50:21] And Lot beheld the well-watered plains,
[1:50:27] and he says, I'd like to go this way.
[1:50:30] Abraham said, "That's fine." And he took
[1:50:32] the lesser and they parted and away went
[1:50:36] Lot in his direction
[1:50:38] and begins a migration. Then the two
[1:50:41] angels come to him. And this is where I
[1:50:42] cut in from last Sunday. And then the
[1:50:45] migration continues, but he's being led
[1:50:48] by something else. He even says to the
[1:50:50] angels, "Can they said we're going to
[1:50:52] destroy this?" said, "Well," he said,
[1:50:53] "Can I go to this little one?
[1:50:57] Can I go here to this little one?" his
[1:50:59] wife has already turned back and been
[1:51:00] turned into a pillar of salt and he
[1:51:02] still wants to go to a little city.
[1:51:05] There's something something is drawing
[1:51:08] him
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; that's different
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; than Abraham
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; because Abraham's being guided by faith
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; and he's wandering through a land that
[1:51:21] has been promised but there's no
[1:51:22] evidence that he actually possesses it
[1:51:25] and wi with Isaac and Jacob and he's
[1:51:28] wandering through this land the Bible
[1:51:29] says but faith was guiding him when you
[1:51:31] say faith was guiding him what was it
[1:51:33] was an instinct I want to walk with I
[1:51:36] want to walk with this God that talked
[1:51:37] to me. I want to stay where I can hear
[1:51:40] his voice.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; I I want to be in a condition. I want to
[1:51:43] be in a place where I can continue to
[1:51:45] hear from him.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; That was Abraham.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; And Lot, he wanted to have whatever
[1:51:51] benefits that the world could give him.
[1:51:55] And so he continued on. And Abraham
[1:51:58] said, "Is not the whole land before
[1:51:59] thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee,
[1:52:01] from me. If thou wil take the left hand,
[1:52:04] then I will go to the right. If you
[1:52:05] depart to the right hand, then I will go
[1:52:07] to the left. And Lot lifted up his eyes.
[1:52:10] And beheld all the plain of Jordan. It
[1:52:13] was well watered everywhere before the
[1:52:16] Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even
[1:52:18] as the garden of the Lord, like the land
[1:52:21] of Egypt,
[1:52:23] as thou comest unto Zor. And then Lot
[1:52:28] chose him all the plain of Jordan. And
[1:52:30] Lot journeyed east. He migrated east and
[1:52:34] they se separated themselves one from
[1:52:37] the other. There's something that
[1:52:39] triggers there's something that triggers
[1:52:42] a migration as you see in the pictures
[1:52:44] of these animals. And brother Brandham
[1:52:46] says about the little duck says it'll be
[1:52:49] the first breeze that comes the first
[1:52:52] cold breeze
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; that comes
[1:52:55] and it triggers a migration.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; I got to move away from this.
[1:53:06] I say this without apology.
[1:53:09] When you feel that cold
[1:53:12] negative breeze
[1:53:14] coming your direction,
[1:53:16] hear me folks, you move away from it.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; You take your God-given wings
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; and move away from it.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not talking about
[1:53:30] individuals. I don't care who the
[1:53:32] individual is. I don't care if it's my
[1:53:34] family. If you hear a negative
[1:53:37] and something that is not according to
[1:53:39] the word of God,
[1:53:42] you move away from that cold thing
[1:53:44] because that'll do you damage.
[1:53:50] Satan wants to use those things
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; to create situations
[1:54:00] that will leave you wounded.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Just move away from it.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:16] Something triggers the migration to the
[1:54:19] promised land.
[1:54:21] And here's what the scripture says. Are
[1:54:23] you able to follow me?
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Paul, Apostle Paul said in Galatians,
[1:54:28] "Wherefore then serveth the law." What
[1:54:30] did this law do?
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt thou shalt not. Thou shalt
[1:54:34] thou shalt not. What good was the law?
[1:54:36] What did it do? He said it. It was added
[1:54:40] because of transgression. Because there
[1:54:42] was if there's no law then there's no
[1:54:44] transgression. So God gave a law and
[1:54:47] then the people become guilty and they
[1:54:49] say oh I'm not supposed to do this. Now
[1:54:53] the law made the transgression. It gave
[1:54:56] and it brought a guilt. But he said this
[1:54:59] that wherefore serveth the law. He's
[1:55:01] asking a question. What did the law
[1:55:03] serve? said it was added because of
[1:55:06] transgression because the people were
[1:55:08] committing transgressions, but they
[1:55:09] didn't know there were transgressions
[1:55:11] till the law said. You can go down the
[1:55:13] street here if there wasn't a 30 mph
[1:55:15] zone out here, you could drive 50. And
[1:55:18] so some would drive 50, some would drive
[1:55:20] 60, some would drive 40. But it's
[1:55:22] dangerous. And so the they they with
[1:55:25] their science and everything put in a
[1:55:26] law and says it's 30 or in Blaine it's
[1:55:29] 25 or it's it's 50 kilometers or
[1:55:32] whatever it is. This is a speed limit.
[1:55:34] This is a safe that we're trying to keep
[1:55:36] it safe for the people. And then if you
[1:55:39] go beyond that, you feel a little
[1:55:41] guilty. You're wondering if there's a a
[1:55:43] cherry light blinking behind you because
[1:55:45] you're breaking the law. And soon as
[1:55:48] you're breaking the law, there's a sense
[1:55:50] of, you know, everything's just not
[1:55:52] right. And you feel a wee bit condemned
[1:55:54] only because you know that there's a
[1:55:56] sign there and you go past the sign and
[1:55:58] it says 30 and you're going 40. You feel
[1:56:02] that? Bunch of you are smiling.
[1:56:08] It's all right. That's what it came. But
[1:56:10] it says that's not the end of the verse.
[1:56:12] It says till or until the seed should
[1:56:17] come to whom the promise was made and it
[1:56:21] was ordained by angels in the hand of a
[1:56:25] mediator.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; And the reason for this is we're not
[1:56:28] talking about speed limits. We're
[1:56:29] talking now about a law that people
[1:56:32] can't keep.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; You can't keep.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; I
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; I was talking to a man once. He was a
[1:56:39] 7th day Adventist and he says, "I I I
[1:56:42] live by I I live by the commandments." I
[1:56:45] said, "Oh, do you?
[1:56:48] You live by the commandments?"
[1:56:51] I thought I'd just zero in. I said,
[1:56:54] and I talked to him about the
[1:56:56] commandments. I said, "No man can keep
[1:56:58] all the commandments." And the Bible
[1:57:00] says in the New Testament, "If you break
[1:57:02] one, you're guilty of all."
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; So I said, "You're guilty all, including
[1:57:06] the one on the Sabbath." He said, "Well,
[1:57:09] I keep the Sabbath. I keep Saturday."
[1:57:10] No. If you break one of the others, then
[1:57:12] you've broken them all.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; So I said, "You're not living by the
[1:57:15] law."
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; I said, "No, man. The law is fulfilled
[1:57:18] in Jesus Christ." And so the script- the
[1:57:20] scripture tells us that the law was
[1:57:23] added because of transgression until the
[1:57:25] seed should come to whom the promise was
[1:57:28] made. And so when the seed came on the
[1:57:30] scene to whom the promise was made, the
[1:57:33] promise in the seed triggered that
[1:57:36] migration
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; and they began to they began to now we
[1:57:40] had Abraham's children, his children in
[1:57:43] in Egypt and there has to be what's an
[1:57:47] exodus. If you look up the word
[1:57:49] migration, you'll find out one of the
[1:57:51] meaning of migration is Exodus. There's
[1:57:54] a people there that had to migrate.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they wanted to migrate
[1:58:00] long before they did.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; And they cried to God.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Send a deliverer.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Send a Messiah. Send somebody who can
[1:58:09] lead us out of here.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; And so how what was the process?
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; There was a burning bush. There was a
[1:58:17] voice in the bush and then the voice was
[1:58:19] in the man
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; was in Moses
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; and Moses went down and he didn't feel
[1:58:26] very adequate. So he spoke and God the
[1:58:29] voice had told him speak to Aaron your
[1:58:31] brother. He's good speaker. So he spoke
[1:58:34] to Aaron and then Aaron knew what to do.
[1:58:36] Speak to the Levites his sons and then
[1:58:38] they will know what to do. But it all
[1:58:40] came from the bush.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; It came from the voice in the bush.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't know about the
[1:58:47] voice in the tree that says to the voice
[1:58:49] in the tree that spoke to a prophet and
[1:58:51] said, "Don't drink or smoke or defile
[1:58:53] your body in any way. When you get
[1:58:55] older, you'll have a work to do." I am
[1:58:57] the result of that older work.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; I'm the result of whatever spoke to him
[1:59:02] out of the tree. How do you know it was
[1:59:04] God? Well, I wasn't there to be I could
[1:59:07] never I don't have any special equipment
[1:59:10] to tell that that was God. But when the
[1:59:13] voice came out of the tree to the man
[1:59:16] and the man preached it to the people,
[1:59:18] there was an instinct within me and
[1:59:19] said, "That's the truth."
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; I've had questions in my heart
[1:59:26] concerning this word, who God is the
[1:59:28] author. And then and then when this man
[1:59:30] speaks, the questions were answered. And
[1:59:34] then it's it's not a big it's not rocket
[1:59:36] science to say the one that was in the
[1:59:38] tree who spoke to the man, one man on
[1:59:41] the earth, he has to be the author of
[1:59:43] this word.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Can I hear an amen?
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; That's not difficult.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; So, so, so the seed was there. Now the
[1:59:56] people were there and the and the one
[1:59:58] who gave the promise spoke and he came
[2:00:00] now and he said uh that I've heard from
[2:00:03] God and God has sent me and the time of
[2:00:05] deliverance the seed was there and so
[2:00:08] the law was there until the seed should
[2:00:09] come on the scene. Help me now so I can
[2:00:12] get through this as quickly as I can.
[2:00:15] And it triggered another migration
[2:00:18] called an Exodus. I hope you're getting
[2:00:20] to see it. When God speaks, there's
[2:00:22] always a migration. When God speaks, he
[2:00:25] wants to transfer you from one place to
[2:00:27] another
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; spiritually, sometimes physically. But
[2:00:32] just remember, don't allow any physical
[2:00:35] Don't allow any physical migration to
[2:00:38] impede your spiritual migration.
[2:00:41] [Music]
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; So much said,
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; and there's a migration of the people
[2:00:50] that possess the promise. They didn't
[2:00:52] understand it. And he says and the
[2:00:54] mighty God unveiled Jesus is our Moses
[2:00:56] of today. Moses veiled was the living
[2:00:59] word to the people today. Jesus veiled
[2:01:02] is the living word to the people. Jesus
[2:01:04] is Jesus in the church the Holy Ghost
[2:01:07] the son of God in the people revealing
[2:01:10] the world word by the promise of this
[2:01:12] day makes it just exactly the same. And
[2:01:15] he says and remember
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Moses did this and manifested this not
[2:01:20] to all the world.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:23] Say, not the voice that came to Moses
[2:01:26] didn't go to all the animals.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; The voice that came through the prophet
[2:01:30] of God in this day didn't go to all the
[2:01:33] animals.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; The voice that God spoke in the day of
[2:01:36] Noah didn't go to all the animals. It
[2:01:38] went to those that were ordained to come
[2:01:41] into the ark.
[2:01:44] Oh my brother, my sister, if I could
[2:01:46] just impress this upon you
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; that God has made a way and God has has
[2:01:52] laser accurate
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; brought the word to you
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; wherever you were.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; He brought the word to you.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Because you were ordained to go into the
[2:02:08] ark.
[2:02:11] You're ordained to come into the word.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; You're not ordained to join a church,
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; this church or any church. You're
[2:02:20] ordained to come into Christ the word.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; And that's why it's I feel such a
[2:02:25] responsibility to make known the word of
[2:02:28] the hour to emphasize the word of the
[2:02:30] hour. That's all that counts.
[2:02:33] [Applause]
[2:02:35] Whether that word brings us joy or
[2:02:38] whether it brings us heaviness or
[2:02:40] whether the word brings us whatever it
[2:02:42] brings us sometimes it brings us peace.
[2:02:45] Remember now the same word oh my the
[2:02:47] words of Jesus.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; He said I didn't come to bring peace.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Here's the prince of peace speaking but
[2:02:55] a sword.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[2:03:01] Remember also that the lamb, he was the
[2:03:04] lamb, was he not? He was the lamb of
[2:03:06] God. Go and read about the lamb. It's
[2:03:09] not just tenderloin roast.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; It was also the inward parts.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Do I have to eat that?
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; And the bitter herbs.
[2:03:30] I don't really care for that. This isn't
[2:03:32] a smorgus board where you take what you
[2:03:34] want.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; This is you take the lamb
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; and eat it all.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:42] [Applause]
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; And there is a time of such joy and such
[2:03:47] peace.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Boy, I just feel completely
[2:03:51] you know my whole inards are in are just
[2:03:54] bursting with such joy and happiness.
[2:03:57] But then there's the other time of that
[2:03:59] you're still eating the lamb
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; and it'll really show who you are.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; It says, "And Moses did this and
[2:04:13] manifested this not to all the world but
[2:04:16] to the Exodus people."
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Hello Exodus people.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Hello people in migration. Hello people
[2:04:26] who have been triggered into this
[2:04:28] movement into this final epic journey.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. By an instinct
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; called the Holy Spirit.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; I haven't time because our time is gone.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; But the the whole scripture God said in
[2:04:50] scripture because I have so many. He
[2:04:52] said, he said, I will scatter you.
[2:04:56] You'll go under migration
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; by God's scattering.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; And the same God says
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; and I I will gather you.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; You'll be in another migration.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going to send you one direction,
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; not from the Serengeti, but by the word
[2:05:13] of God. I'm going to send you in one
[2:05:15] direction,
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; and by the word of God, I'm going to
[2:05:17] bring you back.
[2:05:19] God sent the Jews over the whole face of
[2:05:21] the earth.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; They were all over Europe. They were all
[2:05:24] over the entire earth.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; You from South Africa, they were there.
[2:05:29] You from Congo, they were there. They
[2:05:31] got into this business, into that
[2:05:32] business. Why? Because God scattered
[2:05:35] them
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; over all the face of the earth.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; And he scattered the peoples of the
[2:05:40] earth
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; over the whole face of the earth. But he
[2:05:43] promised in the end time, I'll gather
[2:05:45] them.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; I'll gather them back. Yes.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; It's not the Jews that gave themselves
[2:05:52] the flag back again and the money back
[2:05:54] again and everything. It It's the word
[2:05:56] of God that gave it. I'm going to gather
[2:05:57] you back
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; to the same land.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; And I must I must just say that and say
[2:06:08] no more.
[2:06:10] And then
[2:06:14] out of them he scattered them. They went
[2:06:17] into Babylon.
[2:06:19] They came out of Babylon.
[2:06:21] They went into Egypt and they came out
[2:06:23] of Egypt.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; They went into Egypt by the word of God.
[2:06:26] They came out of Egypt by the word of
[2:06:28] God. They went into Babylon by the word
[2:06:30] of God. They came out of Babylon by the
[2:06:31] word of God.
[2:06:34] But an instinct.
[2:06:36] And all through this masses of people
[2:06:39] was a faith seed. There were some that
[2:06:41] believed and one was called Mary.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that instinct caused her to
[2:06:48] say, "Let it be unto me according to
[2:06:50] your word."
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; I don't understand how I, as a virgin,
[2:06:54] going to conceive a son.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; That's never been done before or since.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; But I know I will receive what you
[2:07:03] speak. Let it be unto me. That's the
[2:07:05] kind of people that God is his family.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; And she brought forth a son. Never was
[2:07:11] one like him. Amen.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Never was one like him, friends.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Who speaks like this man?
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Tell you, my heart is moved.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; We sing the choruses and they're lovely
[2:07:29] courses to be like Jesus.
[2:07:33] But when we're singing it sometime, we
[2:07:34] may be thinking about, I want to be like
[2:07:37] him, you know, as I picture him at a
[2:07:38] certain time. But do we want to be with
[2:07:41] them when they were accusing him and
[2:07:43] sending him out of this place and
[2:07:44] whipping him and saying all kinds of all
[2:07:46] kinds of nasty things and saying and and
[2:07:49] he and he began to speak. Hey, it wasn't
[2:07:52] just at the cross. No, he began to speak
[2:07:55] and he said, "Except eat my flesh and
[2:07:57] drink my blood."
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; He had just had 5,000 people in a
[2:08:02] meeting. 4,988
[2:08:05] left him.
[2:08:07] Right.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; To be like Jesus. To be like Jesus. This
[2:08:12] is what Jesus said.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Will you also leave me?
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; To whom shall we go?
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; You have the word?
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Of eternal life.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; The word.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, my sister, I yearn for
[2:08:32] eternal life so great.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; The word of eternal life. I'm in a
[2:08:42] migration this morning. You're in a
[2:08:44] migration this morning.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Headed for eternal life. And there's
[2:08:48] nothing else in this world that means
[2:08:49] anything.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; And Jesus commenced another migration.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Are you listening?
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; I've got to take a few more minutes.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; He's just ready to leave now, but he's
[2:09:02] initiating a migration.
[2:09:04] He's a mo he's a prophet like under
[2:09:06] Moses and he initiated a migration.
[2:09:09] Moses did. And now here's another one.
[2:09:10] He said, "Go ye
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; into all the world
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; and preach the gospel
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; to every creature."
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they that believe and
[2:09:22] are baptized, they'll have eternal life.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Heal the sick, cast out devils, raise
[2:09:29] the dead.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Freely you've received.
[2:09:33] freely give and he began a migration
[2:09:37] [Applause]
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; and they began to go
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; into all the world.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; With this gospel
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; and the migration picked up motivate uh
[2:09:48] uh picked up uh in increase
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; of people
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; and they begin to move this mass of
[2:09:57] people,
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; this group of people
[2:10:16] Hallelujah.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; I just want to
[2:10:21] go you into all the world and preach the
[2:10:23] gospel.
[2:10:26] And then Jesus said, "How be it when he,
[2:10:29] the Spirit of truth, has come, he will
[2:10:32] guide you into all truth."
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; Because along the way,
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; we're going to have some, we've got to
[2:10:39] have some guidance.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; I cannot determine exactly where my next
[2:10:44] footstep is. And neither do you know
[2:10:45] where your next footstep is.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; But he has promised us. He has promised
[2:10:50] us. He said, "You will have it within
[2:10:52] you."
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he will tell you what your
[2:10:55] next footstep. Listen to that voice.
[2:10:57] Whatever you do,
[2:10:59] [Music]
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; brother, sister.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. friends,
[2:11:04] those of you on the internet, whatever
[2:11:06] we do, I can say on the authority of
[2:11:10] God's word that Holy Spirit will give
[2:11:13] you an instinct.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; Gives it to the horses, smells a storm
[2:11:18] miles away before it comes. Gives it to
[2:11:21] the pigs, gives it to the ducks, gives
[2:11:24] it to the butterflies, gives it to the
[2:11:26] insects and some of the lowest, and
[2:11:28] gives it to these animals. And they know
[2:11:30] where to go. They know exactly what
[2:11:32] their food is. Surely the same God of
[2:11:36] creation has given us this instruction
[2:11:40] has given us such a fine-tuned guidance.
[2:11:43] And I don't believe that I am here by
[2:11:45] accident. I don't believe you're here by
[2:11:47] accident. I want to believe I've been
[2:11:50] led here and you've been led by a divine
[2:11:54] laser has nothing to do with this. This
[2:11:56] is accurate beyond laser beam.
[2:12:00] Do you believe that?
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; If we ever needed a leader,
[2:12:20] we needed one in this end time.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; I would have not have known. There's a
[2:12:27] scripture
[2:12:34] that
[2:12:36] ministers and those have read.
[2:12:43] They've read it for centuries.
[2:12:47] While the animals have done all their
[2:12:49] migration thing,
[2:12:51] there are times when the people
[2:12:55] read the scripture, but it's not for
[2:12:57] their day
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; till the seed will come to whom the
[2:13:01] promise was made.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; And how this is a blessed promise.
[2:13:08] For this we say unto you by the word of
[2:13:10] the Lord,
[2:13:13] that we which are alive and remain unto
[2:13:15] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[2:13:18] them which are asleep.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; You and I are not going to hinder those
[2:13:24] that have are asleep in the faith.
[2:13:27] For the Lord himself
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; shall descend from heaven
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; with a shout
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; and with the voice of the archangel,
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; and the trump of God,
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain shall
[2:13:46] be caught up together with them
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; in the clouds to meet the Lord in the
[2:13:51] air,
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[2:13:55] Wherefore comfort one another with these
[2:13:57] words.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; We needed a leader
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; that could tell us what that meant.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; And now in the very closing one of the
[2:14:06] prophets last messages called the
[2:14:09] rapture.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; He refers to this scripture.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; And he says this is the order, the great
[2:14:16] order. And that's the only time he used
[2:14:18] that phrase, the great order or the
[2:14:20] order of this great rapture. And the
[2:14:23] order is there is a shout. We knew
[2:14:26] nothing about that. It's quite common to
[2:14:28] many of us that read the message today.
[2:14:31] But the shout
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; will be first
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; and then the voice and then the trumpet.
[2:14:37] And that's the order. And the sh for the
[2:14:39] apostle Paul says, "We who are alive and
[2:14:42] remain,
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; they hear the show." He says, "The show
[2:14:46] is the message."
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; The show is the message. Now, the
[2:14:51] message has already been declared and it
[2:14:54] was at the end. Oh, I hope you can grasp
[2:14:57] it. It's not difficult, but let me get
[2:14:59] it across. I pray the Lord will help me.
[2:15:01] At the very end of the message, the
[2:15:04] messenger only has maybe six hours left
[2:15:07] of preaching
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; out of thousands.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Six for you.
[2:15:12] [Music]
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Now, here's the order
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; of the rapture." Amen.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; As I started out about 3 weeks ago
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; and was speaking upon the instructions
[2:15:28] and applying the instructions,
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; you have to read the instructions. And
[2:15:33] now God is giving us the instructions
[2:15:36] for the rapture. Read the instructions.
[2:15:40] Hear the instructions. Do exactly what
[2:15:42] the instructions say and you have the
[2:15:44] result. the one who gave the
[2:15:46] instructions and stands behind it and he
[2:15:49] he confirms it and the instructions are
[2:15:52] there will be a shout and the shout is
[2:15:55] the message and the message had already
[2:15:57] been essentially concluded.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; There was only three more services to
[2:16:02] speak and the message was already
[2:16:04] concluded and it had already gone out.
[2:16:07] We have we have been the recipient
[2:16:11] somehow. And I'd like to ask you, you
[2:16:14] know, why you're here. Not so much why
[2:16:17] you're here, but what is it that
[2:16:23] ignited something?
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; What is it that caused you to be perked?
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Something came your way. And as I look
[2:16:32] across this congregation, I see from
[2:16:34] north to south to east to west and
[2:16:38] there's been already a physical
[2:16:39] migration. But the physical migration
[2:16:42] doesn't mean they say the whole world is
[2:16:43] a community today. It's just become a
[2:16:45] village. That's fine. But amongst that
[2:16:48] whole sea of humanity that is going to
[2:16:51] and fro throughout the whole earth. And
[2:16:54] the scripture says the days will come
[2:16:56] when they will be be young men and young
[2:16:59] women will be seeking for bread.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; And there will be a famine in the land.
[2:17:06] And the famine is for hearing the word
[2:17:09] of God.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; Oh God help me.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; The famine is for hearing the
[2:17:15] instructions. But you can't hear the
[2:17:17] instructions without the leader.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; And Moses was concerned about being the
[2:17:21] leader. He says, "How? They won't hear
[2:17:24] me. They won't listen to me." And God
[2:17:26] didn't change his mind. Says, "I'm still
[2:17:28] going to use you. It'll be Aaron. Speak
[2:17:31] to Aaron." Brother Brandham, he didn't
[2:17:33] he didn't really want he didn't choose
[2:17:37] the kind of life
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; that he lived
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; that was ordained of God. And friends,
[2:17:43] it was not an easy life,
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; but it was lived for you and I.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus life was not an easy life, but he
[2:17:50] lived his life for you and I.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; Is this coming across to you?
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; But now come the last phase, just the
[2:18:01] last phase of this journey,
[2:18:04] this great epic journey
[2:18:07] from mortality to immortality.
[2:18:11] I look on you young people. Hey, doesn't
[2:18:15] take very long. I look upon some here
[2:18:18] that were a lot younger as I was a few
[2:18:21] years ago. But we've been on a journey
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; and it's a great journey.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't want it any. We're
[2:18:28] migrating.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; We're not just migrating to another city
[2:18:33] to a better place or, you know, a better
[2:18:36] life. That's not it. We're migrating to
[2:18:39] eternal life.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, how I desire that.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Eternal life.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about something
[2:18:46] in the end time message is to get the
[2:18:49] bride ready
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; and prepared for the rapture.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; And according to Malachi 4 is to bring
[2:18:56] them back
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; to the faith that was once delivered to
[2:18:59] the saints. Bring them back to the faith
[2:19:01] of the fathers. There's something
[2:19:03] strange,
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; a strange presence that begins to move
[2:19:08] within the believers.
[2:19:11] And it's a it it's not a timid, weak
[2:19:16] strength.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; It's something that's very strong.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; I want to actually preach on it as well,
[2:19:26] Lord willing. I want to preach on the
[2:19:29] aspect this generation, you know, is a
[2:19:32] very soft,
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; limp,
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; generation.
[2:19:39] But you read those in the scripture. We
[2:19:42] talk about David's valiant men.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; We talk about the believers and read
[2:19:48] Hebrews 11 when you're done. They
[2:19:51] wandered around in the dens and caves of
[2:19:53] the earth of whom the world is not
[2:19:54] worthy.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; They were saw aunderder. They were
[2:19:58] tortured. They were slain with the
[2:20:00] sword. And others would not even uh
[2:20:05] they said that they desired a better
[2:20:07] resurrection. So they didn't want to
[2:20:09] escape the sword. To me, friends, that's
[2:20:11] not the group of people that grew up in
[2:20:13] this generation. We we we've got a
[2:20:16] different pressure. We got one of soft.
[2:20:19] But I think that I want to bring across
[2:20:21] to you, Lord willing. There's something
[2:20:23] tenacious, tenacious about the people,
[2:20:26] the believers. And we we are to be a a
[2:20:31] not merely a strong people, not merely
[2:20:34] veilant people, but aggressive
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; with our faith.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; Because uh when I when I went and saw I
[2:20:46] I actually listen quite a long time ago.
[2:20:49] I saw these animals I in their in their
[2:20:53] journey
[2:20:55] and I even asked myself why are they
[2:20:57] doing this? Why are they doing this? And
[2:21:00] you know it helped me to understand
[2:21:02] myself because then you start asking
[2:21:04] yourself why am I doing this?
[2:21:06] Why are we in this journey?
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; I guess the better question is could you
[2:21:12] quit?
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; Could you let go?
[2:21:18] I can't
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; say, "Well, to whom would we go?"
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; I urge you with everything that's in me,
[2:21:26] live it.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; Live it
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; with greater force.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; Live it with a greater zeal.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can you be too on fire? I
[2:21:36] don't believe so.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; I don't believe so. Live it with
[2:21:40] everything that you have because the day
[2:21:42] will come surely and you'll remember
[2:21:43] these words when you will not regret
[2:21:46] having lived it. Amen.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; I want to sing. If the musicians will
[2:21:54] come, please. I want to sing. I feel the
[2:21:57] pull
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; and I've I've heard the call
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; and the spirit. I love those words. It's
[2:22:06] calling me to give my all.
[2:22:12] Let's just stand.
[2:22:15] Let's bow in prayer a moment, please.
[2:22:22] Dear father,
[2:22:28] thank you for your kindness.
[2:22:31] Thank you for your grace that has called
[2:22:34] us and brought us here,
[2:22:39] Father, by the Holy Spirit. And we we've
[2:22:43] heard many references of the Holy
[2:22:45] Spirit. The fire he will baptize you
[2:22:47] with the Holy Ghost
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; and fire.
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; Lord, I feel that fire.
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; I sense that burning within.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; I sense that determination, oh God. Not
[2:22:59] merely in the animal kingdom and the
[2:23:01] creatures of the earth, but we you have
[2:23:04] spoken to us.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; You have sent a powerful message to us,
[2:23:07] oh God. And I say publicly before this
[2:23:11] congregation, before all that will
[2:23:13] stream or ever hear this service, I feel
[2:23:15] the pull. I hear the call. And Lord
[2:23:19] Jesus, more than just hearing it, we're
[2:23:21] here to say, Oh God, I'm here to listen
[2:23:25] to it. I'm here to obey it.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; I pray that your will will be done. Oh
[2:23:30] father, and now this after service and
[2:23:33] as we prepare for this evening to
[2:23:36] receive the bread, the wine, and the
[2:23:40] Lord's table and the washing of the feet
[2:23:43] of the saints, Jesus, as you did, I pray
[2:23:46] that we will heed your word and love and
[2:23:50] embrace your commandments in the name of
[2:23:52] Jesus Christ. Bless this people I pray
[2:23:56] oh God in a way that we as humans cannot
[2:23:59] bless one another but bless them father
[2:24:01] I pray in Jesus name for your glory.
[2:24:05] Amen.
[2:24:09] I feel the
[2:24:15] I hear the call.
[2:24:20] [Music]
[2:24:22] And his spirit
[2:24:25] moving me to give my heart.
[2:24:33] He speaks to me.
[2:24:37] [Music]
[2:24:39] And I agree.
[2:24:43] [Music]
[2:24:46] Lord, please come and take control. I
[2:24:52] feel the Lord.
[2:24:56] Are you agreeing with the pull? Do you
[2:24:58] agree with the pull?
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; Have you felt the pull?
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; You have, obviously, because that's why
[2:25:04] you're here. I feel the pull.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to lift your voice up and
[2:25:09] make this a declaration.
[2:25:12] Lord, not to me, not to anyone else
[2:25:14] around, but I'd like you to speak it to
[2:25:16] the Lord. I feel the pull.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; I hear your call.
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; Have you heard it?
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; Have you heard it? Yeah. Amen.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; And my spirit
[2:25:34] is answering
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; to that call. If you'll take these
[2:25:38] moments and give yourself, I know that
[2:25:41] God will confirm it to you. Wonder if we
[2:25:43] can just pick it up just a wee bit,
[2:25:44] please.
[2:25:46] I feel the call.
[2:25:51] I hear the call.
[2:25:55] Oh,
[2:25:57] and his spirit is moving me to give my
[2:26:04] own.
[2:26:07] He speaks to me
[2:26:13] and I
[2:26:16] agree.
[2:26:17] Hallelujah.
[2:26:22] Take control. I feel the once and once
[2:26:27] again I feel the
[2:26:33] I hear the
[2:26:40] in his
[2:26:43] me
[2:26:50] speak to
[2:26:53] All that I am,
[2:26:56] all I ever can be.
[2:26:59] Oh God,
[2:27:04] [Music]
[2:27:06] I feel
[2:27:11] I'd like after this service that you'll
[2:27:13] never be the same. I want you to walk
[2:27:15] out of here. I want tomorrow morning.
[2:27:18] I'm praying and I believe and I'm asking
[2:27:19] you, you walk out into this world and
[2:27:22] you say, "I'm in a divine migration.
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; I'm moving. I have a voice that has
[2:27:29] called me and has beckoned me and has
[2:27:32] taken me in a different route than all
[2:27:34] of these people that I'm around.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; Wherever you are,
[2:27:38] [Music]
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; and you'll find out that God will come
[2:27:42] in behind that
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; because you have honored the word that's
[2:27:45] been spoken even today. God will come
[2:27:48] behind it and he will he will cause your
[2:27:50] life to have a different testimony.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; So when we cross over,
[2:27:57] as I was saying to the brothers the
[2:27:58] other night, we had a gathering of the
[2:28:01] trustees, the deacons and the ministers
[2:28:03] and the workers in the office and so on
[2:28:06] just in recognition of their work and
[2:28:08] labor. And I said, "We have one goal.
[2:28:11] I'm not going to keep you now. We have
[2:28:13] one goal and one thing is certain. When
[2:28:16] the prophet went beyond the curtain of
[2:28:18] time, when brother Brandham went beyond
[2:28:19] the curtain of time and all these people
[2:28:22] were there, he said, "Who are these
[2:28:25] people?" Said, "They're your people."
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; Are they Brandhams? No, they're your
[2:28:30] converts to Christ.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; And one place he said, just one place he
[2:28:35] just dropped and he said, "I saw you all
[2:28:36] there."
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; There's no time with Gloria. I saw I saw
[2:28:40] you all there. Amen.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; And when that time comes, what do we
[2:28:43] really want to
[2:28:45] what what do we want to have as
[2:28:47] individuals, as people? You're all
[2:28:48] individuals. I don't care about your
[2:28:50] age. We're all individuals. What What do
[2:28:53] you want really to have happening at
[2:28:55] that time?
[2:28:57] Say, "Well, one thing for sure, we all
[2:28:59] want to have. I was true. I stood true
[2:29:02] with this word.
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; It was a costly word, but I stood true
[2:29:07] with it.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; And I've given it all I can. I've given
[2:29:10] my all. And that's what this course is
[2:29:12] all about. We're going to do it and then
[2:29:14] we're going to have a word of prayer and
[2:29:16] be dismissed. I feel the fall.
[2:29:22] Oh God, I hear the call
[2:29:29] and his spirit is moving me to give my
[2:29:36] all.
[2:29:39] He speaks to me and I'm going to bring
[2:29:44] my Lord and I are free
[2:29:50] for come and take the truth. I feel the
[2:29:57] cold.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; I wonder, brother Dave, brother Dave
[2:30:01] Jabberov, would you come please and
[2:30:03] dismiss us in prayer and was he this
[2:30:06] afternoon, Lord willing, ponder these
[2:30:09] things, would you please
[2:30:13] just ponder them very, very deeply.
[2:30:19] Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you,
[2:30:22] brother.
[2:30:24] We just bow our heads, saints.
[2:30:29] Lord, it's been an incredible experience
[2:30:30] to be here this morning. Father,
[2:30:34] Lord, when I came here this morning, I
[2:30:36] just thought in my mind, Lord, I'm I
[2:30:38] feel like I'm just going to sit down on
[2:30:39] the grass by the shores of the Sea of
[2:30:41] Galilee, Lord, and hear from the very
[2:30:45] voice of my savior, Lord. And Lord, I
[2:30:48] believe I have had that experience this
[2:30:50] morning, Lord. I've heard from your very
[2:30:53] voice this morning, Lord. We want to
[2:30:56] thank you for your word this morning,
[2:30:58] Lord Jesus.
[2:31:00] We want to thank you for a God-given
[2:31:01] instinct, Lord, that's that's brought us
[2:31:04] from around the world and has brought
[2:31:06] us, Lord, to this place.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; Not this building, but this place, the
[2:31:12] ark of your word, Lord Jesus.
[2:31:15] this place where we can hear your word
[2:31:17] through the
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; through the ministry that you have
[2:31:20] called us under. Lord,
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; we are truly eternally grateful. Lord,
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; we look out in the world and it has
[2:31:28] nothing for us, Lord Jesus.
[2:31:30] This is our diet, Lord. This is our
[2:31:33] life.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, there's so much to say. It's just
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit.
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, we just want to
[2:31:43] believe and do what we've heard today.
[2:31:45] Lord,
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; this migration, Lord, we're on a
[2:31:49] migration, Lord. We just want to keep
[2:31:51] migrating, Lord.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; We don't want to
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; stay stagnant, Lord Jesus. We want to
[2:31:58] keep moving, Lord.
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; I pray for every life in divine presence
[2:32:03] from the oldest to the youngest, Lord.
[2:32:06] Hallelujah.
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; Especially the young ones who are just
[2:32:08] starting out in life, Lord. We just pray
[2:32:10] that you would impart them
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; with a stabilizing force in their lives,
[2:32:15] Lord, that would keep them from the hand
[2:32:17] of the enemy, Lord.
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we just don't want to see one
[2:32:21] life in this building that Satan can get
[2:32:25] his dirty hands on, Lord Jesus. We pray
[2:32:27] that you would put a hedge about them,
[2:32:29] Lord. Just fill them with the Holy
[2:32:32] Ghost. Lord, that is what they need.
[2:32:34] That is the stabilizing force. Lord, I
[2:32:38] pray that you would put the Holy Ghost
[2:32:40] into every young life in this building
[2:32:42] this morning. Lord Jesus, let not a one
[2:32:45] of them leave this place, Lord, without
[2:32:48] that inner life that will guide them
[2:32:50] through this journey. Lord,
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; like brother Ed said, it's it's life and
[2:32:55] death. It's life and death. They It's
[2:32:57] not maybe they need it. It's they need
[2:32:59] it. They need it. They have to have this
[2:33:03] Lord Jesus.
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; Give it to them. We pray Lord.
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; We thank you for this time.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; Lord and we just go with us. Prepare us
[2:33:12] for tonight. Lord, we pray. We thank you
[2:33:16] for your servant, our brother Bisco.
[2:33:18] Lord, how we appreciate,
[2:33:21] Lord, just decades, decades of service.
[2:33:24] Father, God bless your servant,
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; and give him many, many more days as
[2:33:29] we're here on this earth. Give him
[2:33:31] strength. Give him revelation
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; in his body. I pray, Lord,
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; and we pray that, Father, as a
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; as his sheep that you've placed us
[2:33:42] under. We pray for our pastor this
[2:33:44] morning for Lord, bless him,
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; and his family, we pray in Jesus' name.
[2:33:51] Amen.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:53] Thank you, brother David. Thank you.
[2:33:59] Will you sing this anthem with me? It
[2:34:01] take less than 2 minutes and then we'll
[2:34:04] be going home. I believe the true
[2:34:07] reward. Hallelujah to the lamb.
[2:34:14] Oh, glory be to God.
[2:34:27] [Applause]
[2:34:31] Heat. Heat.
[2:34:40] Hallelujah.
[2:34:43] Hallelujah.
[2:34:46] I live in the presence of the king.
[2:34:52] With that on your lips, I dismiss you in
[2:34:54] the name of Jesus Christ. We'll see you
[2:34:57] this evening 4:00 at the Lord's table.
[2:35:00] You're dismissed in Jesus name.
