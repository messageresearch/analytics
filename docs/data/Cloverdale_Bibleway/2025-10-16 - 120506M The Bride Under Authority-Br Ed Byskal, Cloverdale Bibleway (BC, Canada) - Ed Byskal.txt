I appreciate our brother Frank. Amen. If there's something on your heart, we're just going to sing. I just want to please the Lord. As we prepare to go to prayer, I'm going to ask our brother John Andes if he would just come and take this request and anything else before the Lord. Amen. I just want to please the Lord. Oh, I just want to please the Lord. Oh, be his will. &gt;&gt; Be his will in every way. to be lost in his presence. Found in his likeness to hear him say, "Well done."

In his will in every way to be lost in his presence found in his likeness to hear say well done. You'd want to hold it up before the Lord. He's he's a faithful God this morning. Lord, the words of those song, the song is so true. We want to come into your presence, Lord. We want to come into your house, Lord, with our heads bowed and our prayers coming up like odors before your throne. Pray the Holy Spirit would just move upon every soul that's here. Take captive all of our hearts together. Lord, we just want to thank you and praise you for this opportunity to call you our father, our savior, to know that you know all about our needs even before we ask. But you're looking to our faith today, Lord. And many hands are lifted up throughout the service out on the internet, Lord. Hearts are lifting up their hands. We want that divine connection in your presence where you can come down and minister sovereignly, supernaturally. Lord, your wonderful savior. Lord, we just come with our hearts open today, asking forgiveness of our sins or anything that would hinder any life that's here. As a family, as a body, we're here bearing one another's burdens, lifting up the weak, praying for one another, having grace for one another, having love for one another. We're reaching beyond our own needs and our own sphere. We're reaching into one another's hearts, carrying one another, Lord, as you carried us, Lord. May the power of God be released today in the services throughout this whole day. Lord, as we wait reverently and and yet freely from our hearts, we want to give ourselves. Cover us with your blood, Lord Jesus. May today be a wonderful time of you speaking to your people. May supernatural things work in our souls, work in our spirits, Lord. As oh God, is even yesterday reading going beyond the curtain of time and your prophet speaking about a young lady who Lord you, your prophet had the time to go out and catch your spirit that was wondering and a young man who his spirit had wondered, but your word caught them, Lord, and brought them back. There's needs and bodies, Lord, that the physician is here and we're here and our whole lives are before you, God. And would you go out after hearts, Lord, and may your love win them back to you, God. We want to worship you today, God. We want to lift up these hands and open up these mouths, Lord. We don't want nothing hindering us at the river. We're getting rapture ready, Lord. Bless our pastor, Lord. And Lord, even Brother Frank Fletcher, God, with these kidney stones. We pray that you dissolve them, Lord. Minister to our brother Frank Fletcher, a veteran warrior, one of our brothers. Oh God, we have a new body waiting. And as we toil in this body and as all of us get older, we need your grace. We need your mercy, God. go to the Langley Hospital, Lord, and be with our brother Frank today, God. Let him know that our prayers are with him, Lord. And let your angels be his comfort. And may ministering spirits guide his heart. Guide all of our hearts today, Lord, for your perfect will to be done in earth, Lord, as it is in heaven. We want to thank you for answering prayers. Every prayer and every heart's cry, we give you today in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You may have your seats. Our sister Naomi Chimpaka is going to come sing for us. Maybe she could come and get ready. We have a couple announcements. Um the fellowship hall is going to be cleaned this next week. All clothing and lost and found items left in the fellowship hall after today will be donated to charity. So, if you could take a look through there, even if you're not sure if you're missing anything, cuz it won't be there after this week. And also, we want to make a reminder for the young people's choir uh today at 3:00. And um is next Sunday Mother's Day? Is that right? So, next Sunday we will not have a 3:00 choir practice, but if we could just have the young people at 4:00 next week just to rehearse the songs for the meetings. So, 3:00 today and then next Sunday we'll just have a brief practice at 4:00 before the service. So, we hope to not cut into the family time on Mother's Day. Amen. Sister Naomi, God bless you. Amen.

I've been singing a lot this week. Then sings my soul. my savior God to thee. That's why we're grateful. He's such a great and wonderful heavenly father, is he not? &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonder if we could just lift that up before we are seated. But I have a few comments to make and then we'll go to the word. &gt;&gt; My soul, my savior to thee. How great thou are. How great are they my soul myior Heat. Hey, Heat. How great are th is worthy. worthy of all praise. &gt;&gt; Glory to God as worthy of all praise. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Father. Thank you for calling us. Thank you for bringing us into your kingdom. We bless your holy name. Glory to God. Amen. Amen. Thank you, choir. Thank you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Perhaps I'll just have you take your seats for a moment. Thank you for being here. Everyone, it means a great deal for us to be together, &gt;&gt; not failing to assemble ourselves together. And the more so as we see the day approaching, &gt;&gt; we certainly see the day approaching. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we're here as part of our inner desire and hunger to not just be together. This isn't just a social event. There's a spiritual event. Two weeks from today will be the anniversary meeting and two weeks from Friday. Friday's already passed so we have less than two weeks will be the first service on Friday. uh we have uh kind of a compounded situation which happens uh on our long weekend. Number one, it is a long weekend and number two, it's the beginning of the or at least I don't know whether it's the beginning or not, but the Cloverdale rodeo is on and uh that makes a kind of a a double problem at the border. So, I want to say this two things. Number one, for those of you who wish you could stay over so you're not having to cross the border in case it's long, I will give you a few details what I think is a better time and a bad time. But for those of you that could stay over and you want to just bring a night bag or something, we're going to ask the congregation and everybody that would have a uh extra bedroom or spare room where you could have a couple or have uh uh singles over or whatever. If you would just please call the office and let us know if you'd have a room uh or you'd be able to keep a couple. uh for a night or two and then uh then we'll leave the choice up to the individuals. For those who would like to stay over or could stay over, uh then you should call the office too and say you'd be you'd be uh you'd be happy to stay over if there's accommodation for you. Uh and I know if the congregation if we just make every space available it would certainly be a big help. Uh I would think that uh Friday Friday is the first service. Uh and just to make sure that I have the times exactly correct. Uh the Friday service is at 7:30 and Saturday morning at 10:00 a.m. I've asked brother Ron Spencer to speak the Saturday morning service and brother Puit will be Friday evening, Saturday evening and Sunday morning. Uh there's quite a number of people coming in and some will be staying on the US side with friends and so on and we're happy for that. But you should be aware that on Friday uh coming north there could be some extra traffic because there's believe it or not the Cloverdale Rodeo is I think it's the second largest third largest in North America, second largest in Canada next to Calgary and so there is quite a few people that are attracted to that type of thing and uh so you should come a little bit early between 2 and 5 on Friday afternoon. We're just going to have a get acquainted and fellowship time. It'll either be in the fellowship room or over in the gymnasium. Uh and so that will be determined between now and then, but it'll just be a fellowship time. If you want to come a little bit early, that will be fine. And then from f from 5 it will close at 5 and then the service will be at 7:30. So there'll be a couple of hours for people to uh get refreshed. But if you wish to stay over Friday night so you can be here for the Saturday morning service. I don't think the border should be a big problem for 10:00 a.m. service. I I don't think so. It could be a little bit heavy. But going back in the evening could be uh quite heavy. So if you're able to stay, I think that would be wonderful. And uh I know we have a couple of rooms ourselves and we're going to make those. I think they're already taken. They may be taken, but at least we're we just want to make people uh I just want to let you know that we're not we're not just laying that on you. My wife was getting the rooms ready yesterday and so we can have people there. I It's always a joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's always a joy. Uh so that is the main part this and the Sunday morning will be the uh anniversary service and we're just wanting it to be a special time. A very special time. And this is a time we're uh giving glory to God. I've been looking over some of the pictures and and just uh seeing what God has done. Some of it is almost hard to believe that actually that all took place. But 40 years is quite a while. And I can tell you one thing as a testimony. We have no regrets. everything we're able to do for God. We're just so delighted about that. Amen. So, if you'd like to uh stand now, we will read at a scripture out of Luke 7. Thank you, musicians. I have two scripture readings. I'd like to read from Luke the 7th chapter, starting at verse 3 down to verse 9. and then we'll read from Matthew 8 5-10. Just before we read, let's bow in prayer. Gracious and loving heavenly father, we are so indebted to you for all that you have done and are doing and will continue to do. We thank you for your mighty power. We thank you for the release of the Holy Spirit, Lord, upon our lives. We just thank you, oh God, for the reality that you have given us, oh God, the assurance of salvation. And we just pray, Father, that in the name of Jesus Christ, you will receive, oh God, not only our thanksgiving, but now we offer our lives to you. We offer all that we are and all that we ever can be. Lord, we pray that you will take this service and we ask that you will be glorified. &gt;&gt; You're the only one that's worthy of glory &gt;&gt; and we give ourselves to you, Father, as we've already prayed in the study and we agreed, oh God. And if you you said if two or three shall agree, it shall be done. And so I pray with this congregation, with all that are streaming this service, be glorified. be glorified, oh God, and let the words of our lips and let the praise from our soul give you glory. We pray, Father, that you will do all manner of things, those things that are even exceedingly above all we could ask or think. Pray that you will not only heal the sick, pray you'll deliver the bound. Pray, oh God, you'll fill with the Holy Spirit those that desire and hunger and refill, oh God, each one of us. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; And let everyone say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good. All right. We're going to read from Luke now the 7th chapter, starting with verse three. And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant. And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying that he was a worthy, he was worthy for whom he should do this, for he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue. This man was a centurion that they're speaking of. Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now a was when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself, for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof. Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee, but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed. For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers. And I say unto one, go, and he goeth, and to another, come, and he cometh. And to my servant, do this, and he doeth it. When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him and turned him about and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, know not in Israel. And then in Matthew the 8th chapter and verse 5, we read of the same account. And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion beseeching him. And saying, Lord, my servant lith at home, sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. And Jesus sth unto him, I will come and heal him. The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof, but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this man, "Go," and he goeth. And to another, "Come," and he cometh. And to my servant, do this, and he doeth it. And when Jesus heard it, he marveled and said to them that followed. Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, know not in Israel. So we can see that faith is even tied to what this man learned from authority. And I want to speak about that. I want to speak about the bride under authority. You may have your seats. You'll need to listen and follow closely and Lord willing I may have to take another portion of this of this wonderful truth and it's a mighty truth. I want to ask first what is authority? we say the authorities uh but what is authority as far as we are concerned as as far as we are as individuals and I looking into it have said it's actually a combination of about three things number one in the word uh right from the uh Greek it is the liberty of doing as one pleases. So you have liberty to do as one pleases. But connected to that is it's combined with the ability and the strength with which one possesses. So now one is given authority but in God's case and in the believer's case uh God also endus the individual with perhaps certain type of character certain type of gift certain type of uh of of whatever so that he would make the right choices uh and use that authority. So and then it goes it it merges from that. He not only is a gifted one but then he has the power of authority. And the centurion said something very very interesting which is kind of the basis. He said I also am a man under authority. You have to be under authority before you can exercise authority. Right. &gt;&gt; I also am a man under authority. &gt;&gt; And and and he was saying it two ways. I'm under authority, but he also exercised and he explained it. He said, "I I say to this man, do this. This soldier, go here." And he goes, "Another one, come and he comes. I say to my servant, do this." And he doeth it. He had authority. And they recognized that authority. But he also was a man under authority. He knew what it was to take orders. &gt;&gt; He knew what it was to to, you know, to cut to the line. He knew what it was to be disciplined. &gt;&gt; He knew all of those things so he could he could exercise that. So the the world wonders, I'll just say this briefly to commence and lay a bit of a foundation. You might not realize it, but the world stands back and wonders at the power of the believer in this hour. Many of you have experienced it. They they may not say a whole lot. They may not express a whole lot, but it it seeps out &gt;&gt; here and there. And they they marvel at perhaps the homes. They marvel at the structure, how you maintain it, how you maintain the home or the family or the life that you have when others are just seemingly cut loose and there's uh it the fiber of uh society seems to be pulling apart at the seams, but instead the believer seems to be able to maintain maintain. Is that not so? Amen. &gt;&gt; They're able to maintain a life and maintain a certain standard and something that actually if you described it to the world it seems unreal &gt;&gt; and and it is unreal for them &gt;&gt; but that is uh because we are we are under authority. Now, you know, couples when they get married, it's one of the things that the young lady finds out that now there's a head in the home uh beside maybe she was in a home and had her father and so on. But after they get married, then there's uh to be another head in the home. But it's it is absolutely essential to realize that we talk about a message coming. We talk about the revelation of Jesus Christ. We talk about him revealing himself as the bridegroom. I want to say to the church very quickly, anybody who considers themselves a believer, you have come under another level of authority. And if we don't submit to the word and submit to that authority, we're going to be shortanded on giving any authority. &gt;&gt; We can't give authority. We can't exercise authority. We can't exercise that aspect of of even the offices, mother, father, young people, whatever they are, pastor, deacons, whatever more. We have to realize we have come under authority &gt;&gt; and we're obliged to live by a word that is the word is Christ. &gt;&gt; If we think it's a book of rules, you're going to miss it. &gt;&gt; It's not a book of rules. It's a person. It's a headship of Jesus Christ in a union of marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; There's five people that I wish to speak of who were given the use of authority. I hope I can get through these five. And uh one is Esther, Queen Esther. Uh Mori. Mori took her took Esther to be his own daughter when her mother and father had died. She was an orphan. And uh Esther was uh the daughter of Mori's uncle. You don't have to try to follow that out. But Morortei's uncle, he had raised uh she was the daughter of his uncle and they had died apparently and Mori took her as his own daughter and raised her and that's all in the book of Esther. And then there's this centurion which we've just read of. There is Jesus Christ himself. And I want to also give a few accounts of brother Brandham's ministry in this day. And there are some certain quotes which are really outstanding and I trust I will be able to get to them. You know that brother Brandham uh he was authorized and I I will be going into that but just as one instance I would just mention it to the brethren in the study because I was so struck by it. Uh I the first meetings I was in uh he had the sign in the hand. He would take the people by the hand and uh and uh uh was able because he the angel had said I'll give you you'll be given two signs. So he had a sign. He took the people by the hand. The second one was he would know the secret of their heart. And uh so he had this woman by the hand and he told her it's a tumor. And that was right is a tumor and it's showing. So he said, so he had the people bow their head and in this case wasn't only just a tumor, it was a demon. And he he came against that demon and looked and nothing happened. He said, "It's still there." And he came against it again. He said, "It's still holding. So there's something wrong." And and that that spirit would not leave. And then he spoke to her and dealt with her and uh just uh had some private conversation and he says, "All right, now we'll pray." And the people had their head bowed and he prayed and that thing left &gt;&gt; and the hand comes normal. Why did I say that? That was a display of authority. &gt;&gt; And he was under authority by an angel commission. and he knew that demon had to leave. &gt;&gt; You have to know where you stand and you have to know that you're standing &gt;&gt; where God wants you. You know that you have to be standing under submission. You have to be under the authority in order to exercise the authority. But when you're under it and you're being submissive to it, then you know you have confidence &gt;&gt; that thing can't stay there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, everyone everyone that's here to different degrees exercises some form of authority even in decisionmaking or whatever. And Jesus had supreme power and authority to conduct that power. However, he was in complete submission to the scripture. He himself was in complete submission to the scripture and to the will of God spoken by the prophets in the word of God. He made himself submissive to that word. And that's why he had supreme authority and supreme power. Jesus said, "And Jesus came and spoke unto them." is Matthew 28:18 saying all power is given me in heaven and in earth. But he also had the con character to control that power. He said in John 10:18, "No man taketh it from me." He was speaking now about his own life. No man taketh it from me or takes my life from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it up again. But that isn't where he ended. He said, "This commandment have I received of my father." &gt;&gt; So he knew that he could lay down his life and he would take it up again &gt;&gt; because this was written of him that his body would not even see corruption. So you may have the power to do a certain thing. Listen to this one close now. You may have the power to do a certain thing, but do you have the scriptural permission? &gt;&gt; This comes right down into our life. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, well, I have a I have an opportunity uh for a job over here. I have an opportunity to do this or to do that. I have an opportunity." But do you have scriptural permission to do it? &gt;&gt; You have the power to give somebody a piece of your mind, but should you do it? &gt;&gt; That's the next thing. You You have the power to do it, you can verbally put it together, hey, I can too. But sometime just when you want to do it, you have to bite your tongue because you have to say scripturally, I shouldn't do that. &gt;&gt; I just shouldn't do that. That's that that's how it comes right down to where we live. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to just take the visitation of the angel for a moment. Receiving the authority. Receiving the authority is someone with official power. Someone who has authority is the right or power to enforce rules or to give orders. Now in the in the message God revealing himself to his people when he heard had this visitation of the angel he said I knew that was the same voice that spoke to me all along and that was the first time that I'd ever seen it like that but I knew that voice and he said here's a voice now fear Not. I am sent from the presence of the almighty God to tell you that your pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe pe peculiar birth and peculiar life has been always misunderstood with men and said your peculiar life and your peculiar birth has been to indicate that you're to take a gift of divine healing to the peoples of the world and as Moses was given two signs so you will be given two signs the First will be that you'll be able to detect the diseases by your hand and taking the patient by the right hand. And if you'll be sincere when you pray, get them to believe you and be sincere when you pray. Here it is. Nothing will stand before your prayers, not even counsel. &gt;&gt; And the thing was, if that didn't happen for the next 30 years, before millions of people, &gt;&gt; we'd have a reason to doubt it. But this generation has no reason to doubt it. &gt;&gt; To receive authority is to believe in it. And I'm going to come a little further into this uh just in a few moments in the message. Uh and he spoke of his own ministry. He said dealing with one at a time. you're just dealing with one person and another person, another person. Rather than having them come through a prayer line, he says, "I with those prayer cards," he gave out prayer cards. He said, "I just have to take one at a time." And here it comes through the different diseases and the only that only tells what's wrong with the person. But it's the faith in God. It's the faith in God that heals us. So it's to take just one at a time. One at a time. And they come up with a prayer card. But he said it's the faith in God that heals us. Believe the authority. Believe God. Now he's talking not only about having authority or exercising authority, but the individual believing in the authority. &gt;&gt; Believe in the authority. Believe God and look and live. in Mark 13 and34. That's why I said I'm glad you're listening closely. For the son of man is as a man. Uh and Mark is only 16 chapters. So this is getting towards the end of towards the cross, the crucifixion, and the burial. It's important to place it. For the son of man is as a man taking a far journey who left his house. Because he's talking now. He's talking now about what's going to happen. just in the next short few days. So the son of man is as a man taking a far journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work and commanded the porter to watch. Watch ye therefore, for you know not when the master of the house cometh at even or at midnight or at the cockcrowing or in the morning, lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And what I say unto you, I say unto all, watch. Now he's talking about he's going to give his servants authority &gt;&gt; and then men sleeping. But he says he says you know not the time he said and less coming suddenly he find you sleeping. Say really men given authority sleeping. But here these same men uh he went right to the garden shortly after this the garden of Gethsemane and and and three of his greatest were sleeping. &gt;&gt; They were sleeping. the conditions can make us uh I won't say uh uh you know lethargic necessarily but conditions and the conditions of this age the conditions the world that you live in the real world is designed to sap your energy &gt;&gt; and to almost make a person lethargic &gt;&gt; because a person gets can get weary &gt;&gt; and that's why Jesus spoke the way he spoke and so men of authority and immediately following this scripture which Jesus I just read of Jesus Jesus commenced his journey to Calvary and the disciples began their darkest journey in life and I can tell you that the events of the next few days wearied them out &gt;&gt; they didn't only sleep in the garden. They were filled with fear. They were they were they were convinced that something had gone wrong with the message. &gt;&gt; They were convinced because the great things weren't happening anymore. &gt;&gt; And the people were fleeing and filled with fear and the people who had had all kinds of miracles and things happen and healing. Where all the miracles go? It wasn't the miracles that saved people. That's where they were missing it. And here he was being accused and he fell into the hands of the authorities. The authorities and they were exercising their authority. And uh and the people they were having, you know, you talk about having it seems like this whole country, the whole North America at least. In fact, there's a big part of the world is is all filled with, you know, people in the streets protest protest this and protest that. We took a little walk at at White Rock yesterday just to get into some sunshine and and there there's cameras and everything else was what's going on protest protesting the coal crane toll cral trains going from here to the US. Hello. &gt;&gt; And my wife says, "Well, let's turn around. We're going to be on television." I says, "We're not part of this. Let's just excuse us. We're going through here just like a cold train ourself. Everybody with their little signs and all of this and protesting this and protesting that and the young people are protesting the, you know, stuff is going up, the rates are going up, uh, tuition is going up and hello, this is the real world. uh you can be sure taxes are going up, everything's going to go up. Uh that's just the real world. You know, our money isn't hardly worth anything. I better not get on to that. But uh that's that's the real world. That's where we're at. But the the the talking about the authority and coming into their darkest hour and they got wearied with it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us in Mark 16, now this is after their darkest hour. So I'm I was thinking in fact as I had actually titled this message the road to authority because it isn't something that I just you know we just have conferred on you. You have the authority. Oh great I'm going to go out and do big things. No, it doesn't happen that way. God prepares his vessel. &gt;&gt; And I've got to have time to go into that because sometimes we think everything's going sideways, everything's going wrong. Everything's going in reverse. Don't you fool yourself. With God, nothing's going in reverse. It's right on target. &gt;&gt; It's right on target. And you need to believe that. &gt;&gt; I don't care how young you are or how old you are or where you are in life. As long as we surrender ourselves and keep ourselves yielded and say whatever he said, I believe that I'm going this direction. I've given my life to this Lord Jesus, this revealed word. and uh and I I leave the results in his hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not the one to have to produce a thing. He's the one who said it's a spotless bride &gt;&gt; without spot or wrinkle &gt;&gt; or any such thing. &gt;&gt; Well, we can find all kinds of things wrong. Say, well, this is wrong. That's wrong. Are you sure? Maybe that's what God needs to have happen in order to produce what he what he's desiring to produce. So after after Gethsemane and after the last supper and after the judgment hall and after the people screaming in the streets, the same ones who a week before were were saying hosana, hosana, hosana. They thought he was going to be a king. Now it's down. Crucify. Crucify. Crucify him. People are fickle. &gt;&gt; They were fickle and they're fickle now. It's the truth, friends. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. And and because they don't have any roots. And so it was after all of this and after the crucifixion and the brutality and after the burial and after the resurrection, afterward, he appeared to the 11. Even the secretary's gone. He's he's killed. He committed suicide. Judas. And after he sat with the 11 as he as they sat at meat and he upgraded them, he scolded them for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after his resurrection. &gt;&gt; After he was risen. And he said unto them, "Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature, and he that believeth and is baptized uh shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe. And in my name they cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues, and they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover." So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into glory into heaven and sat on the right hand of God. And they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following. Why? Because now they had gone through a very difficult time, but now he's telling them now they have more authority than they had before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now they're commissioned to do something. They weren't prepared to do this before, but now they had to experience something that was a rather short event. &gt;&gt; When I say short event, in the in the life of uh Esther and Mori, it was their entire lives that were devoted &gt;&gt; to and two people saved a nation. &gt;&gt; Two people under God saved a nation. &gt;&gt; Two individuals no different than two individuals sitting here today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Two individuals. If you put it back as some, you know, glamorous historical thing, you miss the point. &gt;&gt; It's the same today as it was then. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They had to believe then, they had to believe now. They had to be under authority then. We have to be under authority now. &gt;&gt; And able to exercise it. Full authority &gt;&gt; was restored in this day. And we would send to doubt this evidence of restoration. And I'm going to just go through in the message expectation. These are live happenings and I'm going to be as brief as I can. Brother Brent, I'm in prayer and a commission now. But thou demon upon the confession of this woman's faith in the son of God, I come in the name of Jesus Christ, professing the gift of divine healing. You are made known. You can't hide any longer. Come out of the woman through Jesus Christ. Something's left you. He said, you accept him. You're healed. There you are. You feel different now, don't you? All right. You may raise your head. He's saying to the congregation, "Sister, your sins are forgiven and you're healed now." &gt;&gt; It's all right. I know this question in your mind. He said, "It's not me that forgives sins. &gt;&gt; I just see that God has already done it." &gt;&gt; That's authority. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you're sitting here this moment and this morning and you had something and you say, "Well, I feel all right." But maybe in a certain presence, you start to feel a great light, pure light, a holy light &gt;&gt; on your life and just say, "I I'm just not quite as certain as I was before I walked in here." Wouldn't it be wonderful for you to come into a presence where you say, "I can sense this is a presence of not of a human, &gt;&gt; but this is a presence of the Lord Jesus Christ." And then have a vessel for that one who's present to speak to you and say, "Your sin is forgiven." &gt;&gt; And he said, "Straighten yourself up and go off the platform. you're well. He said, "Walk real fast." &gt;&gt; Here's the one I was just telling you about in a message, a testimony, and he said, "Yes, tumor." Why are you saying this, brother? I'm saying this because should we have confidence? Is there is there a good reason why we should be able to give ourselves under this authority? &gt;&gt; It's not just a statement or a quote, but is it a living person, Christ, &gt;&gt; the revealed word, and we submit ourselves and give ourselves under that authority. &gt;&gt; He said a tumor. Is that right? Now he said, "You'll believe." He said, "Ask the people." Let's bow our heads. Our heavenly father, be merciful to this poor woman. Grant, Lord, that she may be healed of this tumor. I ask you to be merciful. Grant it. And here she's to have it removed. Maybe to die in the operation, but thou art here, Father, to remove it for her. Take all this from her. Help her now to be healed in the name of thy son Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, &gt;&gt; it doesn't leave. Just a moment. It didn't leave. It didn't leave her. He said, "See, you see it running on my hand?" He's showing her. You see it running on my hand like that? Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus come out of the woman said seems to hold everybody just keep your heads bowed I want to talk to you he said now you look at me do you live far no far he said there's something see the tumor is making an act some way but there's something causing it to keep it from leaving. You believe me to be a person that's and then it went blank to work hard in life said that's what it is. You know that's right sister but you've got a desire to do that recently more than ever in the last two weeks. Now he's telling her exactly what was going on in her life. He said, 'You've been praying about that, asking God if he'd take you back. Isn't that right? One time you tried to commit suicide. Isn't that right? That's right. But now he said, "You've gotten away. This things's come. This thing's come. This tumor's come to bring you back to the Lord." Isn't that true? I'm not reading your mind. I'm seeing a vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that the truth? Will you promise then that you'll return to God and will serve him all of your life and live? You promise it? All right, bow your head. Our heavenly father, our beloved sister standing here who's once knew you and wandered away. &gt;&gt; She's a backslider. &gt;&gt; And now the secret sin of her life is revealed to her. the thing that's caused her to wander away and now down through the channel of time. Days passed by, you've come and revealed it to her, Lord. She's coming back. Will you receive her tonight here at the platform, a commemoration of the hour. Thank you. Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; God bless you, sister. Your sins are forgiven. Your body is healed. And now go and sin no more. We need that kind of authority. I receive that kind of authority. I acknowledge that kind of authority. And I say it was sent from God to this generation to give you confidence in that kind of authority. And for us to say, I accept that. &gt;&gt; That is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ in action. &gt;&gt; Does this congregation believe that? Isn't that worthy &gt;&gt; of our lives? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not just praying for somebody passing through. But it won't leave. It's also somebody know it won't leave. That spirit won't leave. It's still holding. It's still staying there. It won't go. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She walked off of there with her sins forgiven. Then a person as this brother Brham talks about this Roman or Italian whatever he was Lord I'm not worthy that you'd come under my roof. Neither thought I worthy to come to face you. In other words I sent your church. He sent people to him. He says, "I know that you're a man under authority and I'm under authority and you don't have to come down to my house to put your hands on my servant. You don't have to come here." Now, what's the prophet saying? You don't even have to come and have hands laid on you. &gt;&gt; This man stayed in his house, sent servants. Tell him, "I'm not worthy to even face you." &gt;&gt; Now, he's in a place. I tell you what, friends. &gt;&gt; Now, he said, "Now, be sure to get this." He said, "I'm a man under authority also. And if I say to this man, you go do it, he'll do it. And if I say to this man, you come here, he will come. I'm under authority." And he knew that was the son of God that that every sickness and every demon was under him. And all he had to do was just speak the word. &gt;&gt; He said, "Not pray, speak the word. friends, Cleverdale Bible Way and all that, we need a reality check. &gt;&gt; We need to know that this is the truth. &gt;&gt; This is the way. &gt;&gt; This word that has come. If we can realize I have submitted myself under it. I am under authority and God has given me also a charge. &gt;&gt; Before I'm done, friends, I want you not only to accept this first part of the message. I want you to accept the last part of the message. We need men and women. We need young people. We need them to rise up and say, "I know this word. I believe this word. I give myself to this Lord Jesus Christ who's revealed himself in this time." And as such then, I have a position. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're people under authority and we have authority in the name of Jesus Christ. We have to know who that Jesus is. Not just a historical figure of 2,000 some years ago, but one who's revealed himself, who's alive, who's demonstrated himself and has shown what his will is for this age. &gt;&gt; And there's a danger that this age miss &gt;&gt; talked about the Supreme Court in America, Supreme Court in Canada. There has to be an absolute Supreme Court. You see these judges. They said on the Supreme Court, you can have uh a city court. You can have uh you know courts of lower levels and then you have a supreme court who can overturn the decision of a lower court. But there must be one that is supreme court with supreme authority. And and the prophet says, "You may not agree with their decision, but their decision is the absolute." &gt;&gt; And he said, "Our nation needs an absolute." &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, we have to have an absolute. And if the nation in Satan's Eden needs an absolute, we as believers need an absolute. Not as he won, as he two, as he three, baptize this way, baptize forward, baptize them three times down, three times this way, baptize them as they do in Africa for every sin they can think of. He almost drowned them. I had a brother standing on the standing on the bank and went down there and said, "You're drowning the man cuz they bring him up. You had they believe in baptizing for every sin he could remember." And every time he came up said, you know, he'd remember another one. Down he goes. What? What kind of nonsense and chaos going on? We need an absolute. &gt;&gt; The word of God is absolute and it needed to be revealed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Can you imagine anyone resisting wanting to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ? My wife had been baptized when she was about 12 and in and the titles I had been baptized in the titles. But when I saw that in the scripture, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I wanted to be baptized, rebaptized. &gt;&gt; One day, just quietly on her own, my wife said, "I'm just going to read the scripture." She took the book of Acts and read right through the book of Acts. And every place that anybody was ever baptized in this Bible, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the name of the Lord. There was no other way. And those that were baptized under under John's baptism were rebaptized. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When they heard that, glory to God. We need an absolute. &gt;&gt; And when I see this kind of authority, thou demon, You're hanging on. &gt;&gt; You won't release. &gt;&gt; You're defeated. &gt;&gt; I've been given a gift &gt;&gt; by an angel of God. He was under authority and he had authority and now we come under authority. Hallelujah. And it's not something that's rigorous and something that makes life miserable. It's wonderful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's wonderful. &gt;&gt; It's a liberty. It's a freedom. When we come under, we know we're protected. &gt;&gt; We have a protector. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I hope this meaning something to you. &gt;&gt; He said in another place, we have authority, but we don't have power. He said, uh, this is not a superstition. It is a manifestation of the promise of God. It depends on what you're looking at. No virtue, he said, in any man. There's no power in no man. &gt;&gt; But we as believers have authority. Not power, but authority. Is this this must register in your heart as more than a sermon. &gt;&gt; You got to be able to say, and you should say, I have authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you afraid to say that? &gt;&gt; I have authority. &gt;&gt; You have a God-given authority. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can have a God-given expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What about the rest of your life? &gt;&gt; What about your future? &gt;&gt; What about the future plans? &gt;&gt; Well, if they're under God, it's his responsibility. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do in life? You young people, who are you going to marry? God knows. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As long as you give your life and submit your life &gt;&gt; under under the opaces and under the mandate &gt;&gt; of the word of God in this hour. You can forget your concern. God has it in control. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you can't say, well, what if he doesn't? Oh, there is no such a thing. &gt;&gt; There is no such a thing. What if he doesn't? He will. Amen. &gt;&gt; If if you have that in your mind, then there's some unbelief there. And we would be chastised. The Lord Jesus would stand here and say, "Why do you doubt &gt;&gt; after what you've heard? After what you've seen, after the evidence, after what I've said this generation, how can you doubt?" &gt;&gt; That if you can say from the very bottom of your soul, I don't doubt it. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I give myself to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, you're seeing a fellow standing up here. I say, I gave myself to it. &gt;&gt; At about 21, 22 years old, I gave myself to it. I've never ever regretted it. And when God opened up more, when I saw things start to slide, you know, go down a toboggan ride spiritually. So, there has to be an answer. &gt;&gt; There has to be an answer in the word. This messenger, this prophet gave me the answer of false anointed ones at the end time, &gt;&gt; anointed, &gt;&gt; anointed with a genuine anointing, &gt;&gt; but the vessel themselves have something false, maybe a false doctrine, false teaching. It wouldn't let go of it. Anyway, I'll go on from there. Said, and he gave an example. Are you following me? All right. He gave an example of a policeman and we got policemen. Talk about policemen. There was enough policemen down there at this at this protest protest. Bunch of retirees down there my age and younger sitting around with a little sign. We pro probably cost us a quarter million dollars in taxes. They had policemen and police cars and more policemen. Every time I turned around, there's a policeman. I thought, you know, why don't they get out and do something? I hope you don't mind what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; But they're given authority. &gt;&gt; They're just like you and me. They get up in the morning, they have to have breakfast. &gt;&gt; Men shave. Women do whatever they want or whatever they should. They had some women policemen out there and I I thought if I saw one my wife saying keep quiet now. So I was ready to say, "Why don't you go home and bake some biscuits?" But there's a gun on their side and all this stuff, you know, but they had a yellow stripe down the This is big time stuff. RCMP keeping the peace. About 30 people there costing us tens of thousands of dollars. &gt;&gt; I know what I'm speaking about. Brother Bam says you take a little policeman. He stands out in the corner here. A car comes roasting racing down the road right through city 50 mph. You know, maybe at a 25 or 30 zone. He's he's he said he he couldn't physically he hasn't got the power to stop a bicycle. &gt;&gt; But he stands out there, blows that little whistle. He says maybe he's skinny and his clothes are hanging on him and his cap down and folding his ears down. It doesn't matter what he looks like. He may look like a total discredit to the police force, but all he has to do is put up his hand and blow his whistle and the car comes to a screeching stop. &gt;&gt; Why? He doesn't have any power, but he has authority and the whole city's behind him. If that's what the police force, what does the Bible say about a believer? It says the angels of God, &gt;&gt; heavenly beings are surrounding the believer. That's what your Bible says. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that ought to give a believer some authority to realize I'm under authority. I believe that. &gt;&gt; And I give myself to that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm faithful to that call. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think about this road to authority. I'll watch my time. The lives of these two people. I want to just speak about Esther for a few moments. And there's lessons here for absolutely everybody. the road to authority because I didn't want to get the people or have you you know get just conscious of oh I just had authorities because sometimes we exercise authority we have the power to exercise authority but we really haven't submitted ourselves to the molding of this word and the obedience to this word but when we do we'll find it works differently and uh authority is not in word only. It's not it's more in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the lives of these two people so I want to just uh go into the lives of Esther and Mori for a few moments to to say this and make this statement. There's some preerequisites to authority. Now uh I'm a father. There's men here that are fathers and a lot of you that you hear from your parents on a regular basis. And I want to just say to the parents, you know, sometimes we can exercise authority. We have authority and we can exercise authority, but we really need to check ourselves to see that some of these prerequisites are in place. I say prerequisites. A prerequisite is something that is necessary for something that's to follow. If we want a certain result, &gt;&gt; there can be a prerequisite that's needed. So the vessel must be molded before it's entrusted with the power of authority. There's a lot of power in authority, friends. Jesus called unto him. The Bible says, "But Jesus called unto him and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them." The Gentiles do this. He said, "But you shall not be so. It shall not be so among you. But whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister. &gt;&gt; And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say, Father, in the name of Jesus, let these words of our Lord Jesus sink down into the hearts of this congregation. &gt;&gt; You want to be in a place where you exercise authority. You want to become a servant. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm here to serve the body of Jesus Christ. One of the greatest things I can do, &gt;&gt; to be an uplift, to be an encouragement, to minister to the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Until you get that revelation, friends, your life will be short changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. If authority is to follow, there are some things that need to be in place in order for authority to function properly. You still listening? &gt;&gt; Good. The Bible says of Esther, now I want to go. I'm just going through it quickly. Now when the turn of Esther came there were the story is for those of you that are unfamiliar Vashi the queen refused her husband's invitation to come to this great feast and she refused it and became a spectacle and his advisor said you know if she treats you the king and he had 127 provinces he he reigned all the way from Ethiopia to India He was one of the greatest of kings and Vashi his wife refused to come and his counselor said if that's an example of the leading lady then other women and wives are going to do the same thing they were wise it's still the same today and brother Brandon brought the same thing up now so uh then they said they said let us search in all the provinces of the kingdom and find fair, young, beautiful maidens that can be queen and wife to the king. And so amongst them was gathered a little Jewish girl who was an orphan, but she was striking, absolutely magnificent in her beauty, flawless. and Mori uh who had adopted her, he was he was in the he would sit in the king's gate. Says, "And then they kept these women for one year and for one year of purification with odors and perfumes and oils and so on." And they were under some chamberlains, chamberlains uh men what were like unics and they they and they had chief of the chamberlains as well and they kept them. And then the time came after one year of all of this then the women would go in before the king to see how how the king felt about these young women. And Esther refused all of these fancy things. That's right. &gt;&gt; She was content with what God had given her. &gt;&gt; Now, I tell you what, if there ever was a lesson for today's women, and Esther was a lovely person, and for and not only women, but for believers, we don't need a whole lot of auxiliary stuff. We don't need a whole lot of other things to make the church acceptable or make your worship acceptable. Just exactly what the word of God declares. That's all we need. I think we need to be simple and humble and and and real believers and believe be rugged people for God. Let's not let this generation with its uh to me it's a characterless generation. But but God has given us and infused into us by the Holy Spirit the character of Jesus Christ. Let's let that word when it's transforming power transform us and give us what we have need of. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when the turn of Esther the daughter of uh Abahel the uncle of Mori who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king. She required nothing. And I underlined that and I've highlighted it and I think you ought to do the same. She required nothing. The believer who's bloodwashed &gt;&gt; by the blood of Jesus Christ has been baptized according to the scripture and is under the opaces of the the word of God that's been made known in this age. I tell you friends, I just want to say we need nothing. We don't need a whole lot of fancy things from the world. &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for this congregation. &gt;&gt; We don't need a whole lot of accessories. &gt;&gt; Even when the choir and the musicians when you sing, you play. Don't play for the entertainment. Not that you do. I'm just This just my counsel. Just play and worship to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every once in a while I look at the musicians and you're really intent on your music and I know what it is because I I played in the church for years. But you know what? It's wonderful also for you to give expression. &gt;&gt; Just worship God. &gt;&gt; While you're playing, worship God. &gt;&gt; Just open your mouth and sing with the congregation. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with that. When you sing in the choir, we don't care how this sounds or how this pleases or somebody's a little out of tune or whatever more, but if you if you can't do anything else, at least make a joyful noise unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, I've got some support. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Ryan. Yes. I'm not trying to instruct the choir or the one that's directing the choir, but she didn't require anything. He says, "But what Hegi, the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women appointed, and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all of them that looked upon her." &gt;&gt; In the marriage of the lamb, the prophet said, and you want to, in case you want to hear a message, go and hear that one. And the air is so tight you can cut it with a knife. And he had one of I just finished up listening to it last night and had one of the longest alder services that I've ever heard and be labored to ask if there's anyone and a few and there were young people that came. God bless the young people. But he was telling them in the service, Esther was to become a bride. So she didn't want none of the adorning of the world. She wanted to go in to the king just like she was. &gt;&gt; She adorned herself. He said she adorned herself like the Pentecostal women ought to &gt;&gt; with a meek and humble spirit. And when all of these fancy and first ladies came by with all their new fandangled things, the king looked at them and uh uh put them uh put them in the chamber with the concubines. And when this Esther came into his sight and he got a glimpse of that sweet, humble, meek spirit, he said, "That's her. put her on her head. &gt;&gt; He said, "Then let them adorn themselves like that to have a kind that kind of spirit." Not only the women but the men, too. &gt;&gt; Adorn themselves with a kind of a spirit. Then you're becoming ready for the bride, sweet, reverent Esther made her heart clean. And the Bible says, "And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all of the virgins, so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vastly." The Bible tells us also of Esther because she was Jewish. She had not showed herself. Esther had not showed her kindred nor her people as Mori had charged her. Morortei who was her adopted father, he said, "Don't tell them we're Jews and keep that as a secret." And Mori had charge of that from from a youth. &gt;&gt; And now she's queen. &gt;&gt; Now she's got the golden crown on her head. &gt;&gt; Now she's somebody. Fact is, she is the lady &gt;&gt; in a huge kingdom of 127 countries &gt;&gt; from Ethiopia all the way to India. Listen friends, he's not the first lady of the United States. He's not the prime minister's wife of Canada. This is a woman of incredible esteem &gt;&gt; and incredible influence. &gt;&gt; And she's just gained this. It took a a it took a a period of time. But the Bible is saying and and I want you to mark this. It's Esther 2 and 20. And for Esther, it says Esther had not showed her kindred nor her people as Mori had charged her. She was holding that a secret in her heart. For Esther did the commandment of Mori. She listened to her adopted father like as when she was brought up with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to say to the young people, your parents have not lost it up here. &gt;&gt; I want the young people to say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They haven't lost it up here. &gt;&gt; Esther, she didn't get up there and say, "Well, now I'm the queen." uh you know old my old relative out here and he's still sitting in the gate. &gt;&gt; He just wanted one of the lowest of servants sitting in the gate &gt;&gt; but he he he always wanted to be there and he wanted to just keep eye on what was happening. &gt;&gt; You know why? Not because he was a relative but because he was a Jew. &gt;&gt; True. And he told her, "Don't say anything." That was the only thing he told her. Don't say anything about it because there was a time that would be essential. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "And after she become a queen, and I want this as a lesson to this congregation, we never never shall get above the wisdom that comes from God. I want to say when God sets an office, &gt;&gt; whether it's a husband in a home &gt;&gt; and he and he and he's submissive to the word, he must be submissive to the word or a wife in the home or a father or a deacon or a minister of the gospel. They have an office given by God. &gt;&gt; I can't I can't apologize for that. They have an office given by God. &gt;&gt; It's in the word of God. And we need to find ourselves to be in cooperation with the word of God. And then when we do come under authority, then our words carry some weight. &gt;&gt; And she never lost her respect. Even though he's sitting in the gate as one of the lowest of servants, just sitting as a servant. She's a queen. She has her own house, her own room. And this is one who can go in to the king. You don't just go into the king, friends, because if you did, you got killed right there, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Unless he raised his golden scepter. &gt;&gt; And this is all coming up. I'm preaching this because it's needful. Amen. &gt;&gt; I say to you children and young people, honor thy father and thy mother that your years may be that it might go well with you and your years may be long in the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even my father, my father in the flesh was a lover of the word of God, a godly man. God didn't open up the the revelation of the word to him. had never changed our relationship one iota. &gt;&gt; That's why I say I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham said this to me. He said, "Brother Eddie," and we were in a motel. He said, "If you stacked gold from the floor to the ceiling, gold bricks, and you asked me, would I sooner have that or have five minutes with my daddy?" And his father was a uh bootleger, &gt;&gt; made alcohol. &gt;&gt; He said, "I would take the five minutes with my daddy &gt;&gt; rather than gold from the floor to the ceiling." He meant every word of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Honor thy father and thy mother. And I believe that people that will do that. And this age has got a horrible spirit on it &gt;&gt; for young people to start to think our parents don't understand our parents. She could have well said, "Well, he doesn't understand. He doesn't understand. I I I'm in here and I have a certain status and I have a certain responsibility. I've got a full slate. My life is busy. It's completely changed. &gt;&gt; But some things don't change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may not want me to preach like this. &gt;&gt; But I'm preaching like this. &gt;&gt; And if we can turn even the minds of the young people and those that aren't even here will get to hear this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need to honor honor father and mother. &gt;&gt; Honor the offices that God gives. and you respect it and you watch and see the blessing of God come upon you. &gt;&gt; That's right. like it was when she was brought up. The supreme test was yet to come. What? What am I preaching on? the way, the road to authority. &gt;&gt; They've lived this whole life. &gt;&gt; You know, sometime we don't know what we're doing. You've you've you I won't take any time with this, but you've heard a bit of my testimony from time to time. I just put it in a in a service. And I I want the young people to know, too, we haven't all had an easy life. And my mother died as I and I said this in Switzerland. I said my mother died when I was young that they had not heard that. And I stepped down in front of the pulpit and I was speaking on something's wrong. Something's not right. I couldn't understand it but something's not right. And I stood beside her little clothcovered coffin, the cheapest you could purchase, I guess. And and a woman came down, broke off that big lily and stuck it in my hand. And I looked at that big white lily that was about that time of the year in May, I believe it was. And I I just looked at that lily and I looked at this coffin. I was six and a half. I just knew something is terribly wrong. This isn't to happen like this. You know, my mother is gone. I couldn't even I couldn't even understand it. I told that in Switzerland. I don't even know why I told her. I was standing down here just telling it. One of the pastors that was in that meeting was just in Siberia. He just got emails. We've been emailing back and forth this week since last Sunday. And he's been in Siberia and he has gone there. Brother Gidto, many of you know brother Gido and he was in he was in Siberia and brother Dennis from Latvia was with him as an interpreter and and they're going to because brother Gito's gone to orphanages for years and now those orphans have grown and they've gotten grown and they married and there's new orphans coming up and brother Richard you went with him. He mentioned you two three times and because he said that brother when brother Richard was here and then they went to Moscow and saw a woman I think was an orphan and or was in the orphanage and she uh has she's married now and has some children and was visiting her. You probably know her. And uh and so anyway, I just told that and he said, "Brother Biscll," he said, "I just was in a service with the orphans, an orphanage, and a and a young girl, she's probably 9 or 10 years old, she came up and she said, "Brother G, why do I have to be an orphan?" And he says he didn't even have an answer. He didn't know what to say to her. He said, "And just at that moment," he said, "what your testimony came to my mind." And I told her that about Brother Biscll was just speaking in Switzerland and that his mother was taken at 6 and a half and he was saying there just something we don't understand, but uh we we know something's wrong. But he says, and he just finished speaking. So he said, "It's not only you." And he said just a piece came over her and she was understanding and that satisfied her. And I thought, you know, God probably God knew that girl was going to come and ask him that question and caused me to say that right then for her that girl's sake. And I'm just glad any part of our testimony can be. But sometime and and and uh uh Esther now she's she's she could go back to her orphan life and uh you know brought up by her uncle and and and then you know Mori or her uncle uh Mori's uncle I should say passed away and and then she's raised by Mori and now now she's swept into you know selected elected. &gt;&gt; We're people that know what election is don't we? So many people when they first come they say, "Why me? &gt;&gt; Why me? Why not somebody else?" Well, she she's she's not just saying that. She all she knows is she's swept into the absolute height, the apex, the epitome of of the just perfect position and say, "Who could be what could be more glorious than this?" But she wasn't caught up with the glamour of it. She still remembered what Mori said and she listened to that as a head of the state, the leading lady like she did when she was brought up. &gt;&gt; I say to all here, &gt;&gt; though we may not be children, that is a principle we should not forget. &gt;&gt; And now comes the great test. And there's uh Hmon has raised up. I'm just going to be a few minutes. Just give me a few minutes. Hmon has raised up and he hates the Jews or could be Christians, but he hated the Jews. And now he gets a he gets a declaration from the king that they would be slain. and and it's it's taken out to all of the provinces that on a certain day the Jews you'll gather them and slay them. That spirit Hitler did the same thing. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, we don't have to talk about whether our whether we're Soviet or whether we're Jewish or whether we're Russian or what we are. The world is the world &gt;&gt; and it's the devil to begin with. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's been all down through history &gt;&gt; cuz God chose those people to be in a to be a certain uh to be of a certain class in the world as a as a he raised them up as a symbol to the world. &gt;&gt; And so they're going to slay them. And so now Esther is put into this awkward position that she's a Jew and one has been Hmon has been elevated to above all the princes of the nation and he has come to let uh uh let the king know these people they don't bow to every order because Mori wouldn't bow to him. I don't know how many principles I've given in this service, but I hope you're picking them up. And here's one I use all the time. I want to give it to this congregation. When the enemy this and the enemy that and the devil this and Satan that, I want to say to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, don't bow to him. &gt;&gt; When you recognize this is not right. &gt;&gt; This is from the kingdom of darkness. Don't bow to him. whether it's physical, whether it's a pain, whether it's spiritual, whether it's depression, whatever it is, don't bow to him. &gt;&gt; And that drives the devil crazy. &gt;&gt; And we're happy that it drives him crazy. And it drove Hmon crazy. &gt;&gt; He said, "What?" Even though I'm elevated to the highest position of the head of all the princes, I'm the head prince. &gt;&gt; And he was next to the king. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he came out and all the servants are bowing before him. And Hmon, he won't bow. &gt;&gt; He won't bow. &gt;&gt; He won't regard him. &gt;&gt; He won't give any honor. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, friends, that should be that should be something that's an absolute in our lives. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to bow. I'm not going to bend. I'm not going to compromise. And I'm not going to burn. And it drove him just wild. &gt;&gt; And he said, "What good is all of this glory for me if this Hmon I mean, if this Morai won't bow?" &gt;&gt; So he goes into the king. There's there's some people that won't bow. And he he he identified the Jews. Said they're against our customs, etc., etc. and he wanted a a a signed letter with a king's ring that they would be destroyed. And so then now Mori says to her, and it's a good thing she's still listening. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, if you allto together hold your peace at this time, then shall there be there an enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place. &gt;&gt; You talk about confidence. &gt;&gt; You talk about faith. This is one Jew that wasn't going to be moved. I'd like out of this congregation for people to say, "This is one believer that will not be moved. &gt;&gt; I don't care what Satan throws at us. I don't care what happens. I don't care what the devil's got in his up his sleeve. I will not be moved." &gt;&gt; Amen. You throw all the glamour, throw the best job, throw the biggest biggest bonuses or whatever more or throw sickness or throw disease or throw whatever he can throw at you. But I will not bend &gt;&gt; and I'll not compromise &gt;&gt; and I'll not be moved by it. &gt;&gt; Friends, I'd like to see a whole congregation of people rise up and say, "I don't care &gt;&gt; what this world has. I don't care what this world throws up. I'm not going to be moved by it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Husbands, wives, young people, whoever they are, parents, what happens to your children, hold on. Hold fast to the promise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is this all right? &gt;&gt; Pray that God give you grace to receive what I have to say this morning because this is the road to authority. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a road and you need authority. &gt;&gt; You need to exercise it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say where I need authority. You'll need authority to say, "Satan, &gt;&gt; depart from me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You need authority perhaps as a husband or a man to pray in your home. Say, "Satan, loose them." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you have to be under authority to exercise authority. And it's not just for a single event. You might go through a lot. It went through her entire life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; From childhood. This is all back when she was an orphan. &gt;&gt; She lost mother. She lost dad. &gt;&gt; She's raised by a strange family. Now she's in a strange country. Now she's in a palace. She doesn't know anything about palaces and being a queen. &gt;&gt; But she knew one thing. What I am, that's sufficient. I don't need anything else. &gt;&gt; And I want to say something to you, my brother, my sister, in this le oysia. I don't care what the world throws our way. I don't care how sophisticated. I don't care how techn technological he becomes. What we have is sufficient to overcome in this generation. God has not left us short changed. This word is still sharper than any two-edged sword. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this Jew, he said, "If you don't rise up, God will just bring deliverance from some other place." &gt;&gt; God's plan is not going to be defeated. &gt;&gt; And uh if you hold your peace, there'll be an enlargement that will arise from another place. But thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed. And who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom? What words of this? Who knoweth but what thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this? &gt;&gt; I want to I want to lift that out of the book of Esther and I want to bring it right down to May the 6th, 19 I mean 2012. May the 6th, 2012. Whatever is taking place in your life, whatever has taken place or whatever will take place, the best thing you can do right now while we're sitting here is to realize God brought me here for just such a time as this. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he has deposited in me what I need to do his job and his commission in this hour. &gt;&gt; You need to have that as a result. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wish you would acknowledge it. &gt;&gt; I trust you will acknowledge it. &gt;&gt; God has brought me here for this hour &gt;&gt; and he has equipped me for what I need to serve his kingdom. And finally she said go gather. She decided she was very very sharp, very cunning. She said she went into the king and he lifted the scepter because he wouldn't have her destroyed. and she told them about herself and about her people. And uh she said, "If I perish, I perish." That's where the course comes from. And she goes in and she has a request. And she said, "I would like to make a feast." Hang on. Now, here's the bride saying, "I'd like to make a feast, and I'd like the king to come." And she said, "I'd like also Hmon to come, ahead of all the princes." So, they both came. Hmon was beside himself. He because he was possessed of that one said, "I will &gt;&gt; I will exalt myself. &gt;&gt; I will I'm up here at the top. I'm right. I'm the right-hand man. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what he said? &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that's left. That's control of the whole kingdom. &gt;&gt; Oh. So, he was possessed with that same spirit. and he went home after they had that feast and uh and just the three of them, the queen, the king, and Hmon. And she said, "Now," she said, "if I found favor in your sight." She says, "I'd like to have one more feast tomorrow." and says then I will say because he told her he said to half the kingdom whatever you want to half the kingdom &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; 127 she could have almost had you know almost 65 nations under her to have the kingdom. Wow. Just think what she could have had. She's only interested in one thing. &gt;&gt; What I'm here for. &gt;&gt; Right. what I'm here for. Not the blessings, not all the benefits, it's what I'm here for. &gt;&gt; And uh so the it comes the next day and she says, "Now now I will tell you why I had the feast. There is an enemy of my people who is out to destroy us and to eliminate us and to annihilate us." He says, "Who could be so wicked as that?" &gt;&gt; Right? says, "The man that's sitting here with you," &gt;&gt; says, "Take him out and have him destroyed." And he hung on the gallows that he had made for Mori cuz he was going to hang Mori. And he was so beside himself, so filled with ecstasy that he just thought that this is this is what's going to happen. And the Bible says this, and this is right at the very end of her life and the end of the book of Esther. Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abahel, and Morortei the Jew wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim, which is the feast of Esther. And the Jews today, my wife and I were there last time in Israel. The whole nation was celebrating Purim, which is the feast of Esther. because they're celebrating that God used her and Mori, but used her especially to go into the king to intercede and two people saved a nation. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. I might be I might be regarded as off my top, but I can tell you that you will not know what your life has achieved. The life that's under authority, the life that's under submission. Don't you want to do something for the kingdom of God? Don't end up over there empty-handed. That's why I'm preaching. You're still here. You're breathing. &gt;&gt; You can do something for God. You don't have to be visually prominent or whatever more. I tell you, you can say a prayer. She wasn't out in front. There wasn't millions of people that saw what she was doing. She just she she coo had a meal cooked. Yes, &gt;&gt; she did what a woman does. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But she submitted herself to her old uncle. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't Unk out there or some disrespectful thing. &gt;&gt; It's her uncle Morai. Not her uncle, but the man who brought her up. &gt;&gt; You think this is, you know, I'm not preaching to the air. What would what would you do? you found out, oh, your your parent is not your parent, it's your adopted parent. I've dealt with all kinds of cases and the young people feel entirely different. Oh, you're not my father or you're not my mother. I'm I'm adopted. It didn't make any difference with her. He was a Jew. She was a Jew. And I'm saying this congregation, they're a believer, we're a believer. &gt;&gt; I'm a believer. You're a believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's where the subject ends right there. &gt;&gt; He was old. She was young. &gt;&gt; I'm old. You're young. &gt;&gt; What's the difference? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Not much difference, is there? &gt;&gt; What's a What's a few years to God say, "Oh, they're 50 years older than me. Who cares? &gt;&gt; What's the difference in God's economy?" Absolutely none. Says, "Oh, he doesn't understand." And well, he does. &gt;&gt; That father does. He understands it. He knows exactly what you need. Exactly what this church needs. He knows what this generation is calling for. And his Holy Spirit, I know, has been striving in these meetings because I can feel it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The devil's on the war path. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God is also. &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought I should I thought I should give you this and I'll close. And this great warrior Joshua he's speaking of. Hallelujah. The devils are on the move for Jesus Christ the chief captain said in my name they shall cast out devils. That is as powerful at this very moment as it was when he spoke it or it was when Jesus spoke it. He said, "The devils are on the move." Not because you have a lot of faith or we're some treasured people. Because Jesus said &gt;&gt; in my name, &gt;&gt; they shall cast out devils. &gt;&gt; You might not have heard that. You might not remember that. I will tell you what, there's those here in the in the spirit world that know very well what Jesus said &gt;&gt; and they know it speaks of them. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says they're on the move. &gt;&gt; They're moving. They're stirring. a demon in that demon world are stirring because the God's word has said &gt;&gt; in my name &gt;&gt; they shall cast out devils. &gt;&gt; He said they failed to get it 40 years ago but were coming in now possessing the land. The same pillar of fire. The same chief captain is leading the host of the Lord. And it's your land. God promised promised to prosper you in health. He gave you that body. &gt;&gt; Why don't we agree with this? He gave you that body. The one you're sitting in. He gave you that body. It's yours by possession. The devil's trying to take it over. He hasn't got the authority to do it. &gt;&gt; Maybe trying to tempt some young people away with some glamour or some some thing of the world or some attainment or something else. You want to say to yourself, he hasn't got the authority to do it. &gt;&gt; Greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; They're on the move. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they're being disturbed. &gt;&gt; They're being disturbed because Jesus, the master, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, he spoke the word in my name. They'll cast them out. &gt;&gt; You know what Satan's afraid of? That you'll get enough faith right now to say, "Get out of my life. Get out of my home." &gt;&gt; Get out of my body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's trembling tonight. He said &gt;&gt; and I want to say he's trembling this morning. &gt;&gt; And then he said hallelujah. And I'm going to say hallelujah. I'm going to ask you to say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why are we saying hallelujah? Because he's trembling. &gt;&gt; Jesus said we have authority over him to cast him out. And those spirits in another world are actually moving around. They're distressed. &gt;&gt; In case you might believe it, &gt;&gt; that prophet of God even heard the demons scream out from one person in the audience to another person. And he says those two spirits are crying between themselves trying to get the people to disbelieve. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say to Satan today, scream all you want. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll not achieve your goal. &gt;&gt; Scream all you want. We shall believe the words of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Scream all you want. We will cast you out. You will not have any part with us in our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You know right well that God has done glorious things for you. Friends, I stand here not as a young man anymore. I preached this way when I was young. I was against his kingdom when I was young. Nothing has changed in these 55 years of preaching. Nothing has changed. I believe it exactly the same. I'm calling for others to stand up and take the take the banner and take the baton and run this last lap. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; We need families. We need individuals. We need young men. We need young ladies. We need children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That believe it and will give themselves to it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How old do you have to be? Gypsy Smith who won thousands of Christ. A gypsy. &gt;&gt; One is really considered low &gt;&gt; in the earth. He was saved when he was 8 years old. &gt;&gt; Who's eight? Who's eight? Raise your hand. Nobody eight. Isn't that amazing? Is there anybody nine? That'll be somebody. Yes. Here we have some nine. Gypsy Smith was saved younger than you. And he became a mighty man of God &gt;&gt; and gave his life to God &gt;&gt; from 8 years old on up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I remember standing in front of a service in a tent at four years old singing there's honey in the rock. There's honey in the rock for you. It was about the only song I knew and I loved that song. Oh, there's honey in the rock, my brother. There's honey in the rock for you. Let your sins for the blood to cover. There's honey in the rock for you. And it's just as powerful today as it was back then. Glory to God. Nothing's changed. I am the Lord. I change not. &gt;&gt; He wants people to have the joy in the victory and live under this wonderful covenant that God has given. &gt;&gt; And he said he's not got the authority. You believing this? &gt;&gt; Here's a prophet saying he's trembling tonight. I say he's trembling this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A great whirl of God's power moving in the building. &gt;&gt; And Satan's trembling. I say to you in the balcony, I say to you in this congregation, I say to you in the streaming, Satan's trembling &gt;&gt; because of what God has given his church. He's trembling &gt;&gt; because there's never been a people that's received such a vindicated message. &gt;&gt; He's trembling. &gt;&gt; He's never met a people that's had such a revelation. &gt;&gt; He's trembling. This is the first generation had the seals open. &gt;&gt; If I were him, I'd tremble, too. &gt;&gt; Here's the people that are not going to give up &gt;&gt; and they're not going to compromise. Here's what people are going to listen and hear the preaching of the word &gt;&gt; and they're going to give themselves to the word &gt;&gt; and they're they're a great danger to my kingdom. And I say, you're right, Satan. We're a danger to your kingdom. We're a people that are here to destroy your kingdom. We're a people that are saying, "Let thy kingdom come. Let that kingdom of holiness come. Let the people of that kingdom arise. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't we rejoice? &gt;&gt; And he says, "Yes, &gt;&gt; he's trembling." Oh, what if they'd only have faith? He's talking to the people. His heart's about gone. Speaking of Satan, it's melted in him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Looking into another realm, saying the very heart of Satan is melted in him. &gt;&gt; For I tell you this prophet, he truly lived in two worlds. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, the doctor said I Yeah, the doctor said." He said, "Yeah, but they realize that the host of the Lord is moving now." And that's right. No matter how high he's walled in, how high Satan has walled himself in, he's uh he said he may he may have walled it out of the sight of the doctor, but hasn't walled it out of the sight of God. He might be a great big bluff to the medical science, but he isn't a big bluff to God. &gt;&gt; He said the man of God ministers anointed with the Holy Ghost. And we'll be having a number of ministers in. Friends, don't just think this is brother so and so from over there and this brother so and so here and we're having brother Puit to preach. He's a man of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Satan's Satan's trembling right now. &gt;&gt; I can guarantee you he's trembling right now for the faith that is building up in the people of God. And I have felt a supercharge. &gt;&gt; I have felt absolutely supercharged because there's going to be a there there's going to be a a group of people within this congregation that are giving themselves &gt;&gt; not only to what they read, but the moving of the spirit that's coming in the services. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's come for a purpose. Say, "What is the purpose?" So you can go out these doors and exercise authority. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's got plans for you. But I want Satan to know today, we have plans for him. &gt;&gt; He's going to come knocking on your door, and you're going to resist him. He going to come knocking on the door of your body to make you sick, make you ill, and Satan is going to be told to get out according to the word of God. &gt;&gt; I am one of those. &gt;&gt; I'm part of that number. &gt;&gt; Hey folks, &gt;&gt; I've had them come to my body many times. &gt;&gt; You better believe that. Many times we had to stand there toe to toe and eyeball to eyeball. Amen. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be up here preaching if it hadn't been for the supernatural hand of almighty God &gt;&gt; and my confidence in the word of God. And just simple phrase that the prophet of God said, "Healing is in the body." &gt;&gt; I just held on to that when sickness or something else comes. Healing is in my body. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I let the doctors do what they need to do, but healing is in my body. If you're in physical need, and we're not here having a healing campaign, but if you're in physical need, you can certainly experience and exercise your authority. &gt;&gt; Just make sure you're one under authority. It says, "Ministers of God with the Holy Ghost, they have just as much right, just as much authority to pray for the sick and cast out a devil as anyone else does in the world." He said, "Don't you believe it?" I do believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Victory in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What does this mean to you, saints? &gt;&gt; Don't be backward. Don't be bashful. If you believe it with all your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What are we here for? We're here to prove that our Lord Jesus is victorious. &gt;&gt; We're here to prove that Calvary stands true. &gt;&gt; We're here to prove the devil's a liar &gt;&gt; at every point. &gt;&gt; Here's a man right here. Stand. Joseph. A few weeks ago, this man could hardly walk and people that love him called me. And this is not to say to destroy anybody's faith whatsoever. He said, "I feel that I have a promise from God, but he had a great big lump on his leg and his weight went down and became very frail." And one of the brothers that love our brother called and said, "I'm worried. I'm concerned. If it were me, he'd be in the emergency. He'd be in the ambulance and I'd be calling 911 right now." That's what the brother said. Brother Joseph's never heard that. He said, "If it were me, the last I saw him, I'd be calling 911." That's just a few weeks ago. So he said, "Would you please call Brother Joseph?" I said, 'Well, I have called him. We've spoken together. He gave me the scripture out of the Bible that God made real to him. And I said, "I don't want to tamper with his faith." And he called again and said, "Would you please call him?" So I called brother Joseph. Come here, brother Joseph. I said, "Brother Joseph, I'm talking to you now like my son. If you were my boy, I'd simply tell you, go there and they'll tell you what it is. It has nothing to do with your faith. Your faith is in God. Healing is in God." &gt;&gt; But they'll they'll and and the prophet of God, now we come in submission to authority. The prophet of God said, "A doctor will cut the bad part out." &gt;&gt; A prophet of God said that &gt;&gt; the doctor will cut a bad part out, &gt;&gt; but God does the healing. &gt;&gt; I said, "Would you please for me go to the emergency and have them tell you what that is?" Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. It was a great big mass that was poisoning his whole system and they cut the bad part out and God healed him. &gt;&gt; That's not years and years ago. That's a few days ago. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a brother sitting here in church driving all the way from Seattle. &gt;&gt; That's the word &gt;&gt; that came to us. &gt;&gt; That's the authority we're under. &gt;&gt; He said the absolute might not be what we the answer we want. Say, well, brother Joseph said, I just want God to do it. And I was submitting myself. I I say amen to that. &gt;&gt; If a person's faith is there and that's the will of God and the desire of God, all I know is that it was not his time to go &gt;&gt; and he was fading to nothing. &gt;&gt; So I have to submit myself under authority in order to give authority and say go &gt;&gt; as my son go. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they whisked him right in and operated and took a huge mass off his leg that was poisoning him. &gt;&gt; Friends, I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; And I want this congregation to receive that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And respect and honor. I'm not talking about respecting honor minister. I'm talking about everybody. &gt;&gt; Every person desires that. You young people, your parents deserve honor. And parents deserve to live so that their children will respect them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let them see you in the house of God. Let them see you on your knees. Let them see you serving God with all your heart. Let them see you worshiping God with your life. &gt;&gt; Esther worshiped him with his life, her life. Mori, he laid his life on the line. And because they did that, they were able to write a letter with all authority to all the other Jews. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you know, I was going to preach on the bride's feast because I was going to take it, but I thought I would lose you there. So, I'm preaching on authority. But she made a feast. And they call the feast purim. And it means it's a it's a celebration that the plan of Satan was crushed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say hallelujah to God. How I thank God for the message. The confusion of denominationalism was crushed. &gt;&gt; The false doctrines of the Trinity was crushed. &gt;&gt; This is the bride's feast. &gt;&gt; Oh, come all things are ready. &gt;&gt; Glory to the Lamb. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Will you stand to your feet with me while we give him praise and thanksgiving? Heavenly Father, I want to thank you. Thank you for this glorious truth. Thank you for your word. Oh God, it's not a lot of just uh doctrines and so on, but it's glorious truth that you have unveiled to your bride. Let this be more than just a gathering place of a church, Father, but let it be a place where Satan fears the people and the lives of the people. I pray, Father, that you will do mighty things even this morning. &gt;&gt; As I have spoken, Father, I have felt and sense the words that your prophet has spoken. They're just as real this very moment. And the enemy is howling. He's afraid he's going to be cast out and cast down. And there are people here, Lord, perhaps young people making decisions. They've got to make a major decision. They know a decision is weighing on them. I say, oh God, with the authority of the Holy Spirit. May you go into their lives and grip them. And they may not even be here in the in this building, go to wherever they are. Make their life miserable. Take sleep away from them. Do whatever is necessary to bring them to repentance in the holy name of Jesus Christ. Satan, you are defeated. And we bind you. We bind your power and we bind you with chains of circumstance. You will not succeed in your objectives and goals. &gt;&gt; For we have the victory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, come all things are ready. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. Glory to God. What is that song? We sing a song about uh Amen. You go ahead and praise him while I figure out what this song is. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Uh, all things are ready to come to the feast. No, there's another one. Uh, &gt;&gt; come and dine, master callth. Come and dine. What if we could sing? Come and dine. The master calleth come and dine. Hallelujah. Jesus has a table spread. Glory to God. Glory to God. Glory to God. Glory to God. I realize time slipping away, but I'm not interested in time. I'm eternal. I think when people hear me preaching, they think that I I believe that. &gt;&gt; How many have read the 23rd Psalm? &gt;&gt; Of course you have. This verse will mean more to you the next time you read it. Thou preparest a table &gt;&gt; before me in the presence of mine enemies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. The devil knows what you're fed on this morning and he's prepared the table before us in the presence of our enemies. I want to say in our enemies, take a look at that one. &gt;&gt; Have a look at this glorious truth. &gt;&gt; You tried to lie to the generation in the churches and we have a eye of a prophet saw through your trickery and declared us the truth. Hallelujah. And we have a wonderful table prepared in the presence of our enemies. Jesus has a table spreadus. Praise God. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Take the end. Heat. Heat. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We'll sing the chorus once more. Brother Ron Caldwell. I'd like you to come and dismiss us in a word of prayer. Hallelujah.
