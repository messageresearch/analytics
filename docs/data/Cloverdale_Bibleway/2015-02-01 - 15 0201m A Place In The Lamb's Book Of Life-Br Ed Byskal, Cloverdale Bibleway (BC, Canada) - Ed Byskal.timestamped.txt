[9:07] faith to you this morning, Lord Jesus,
[9:09] and claim it's already been done,
[9:11] Father. We believe it, Lord. We believe
[9:15] you've already provided every need, oh
[9:17] God. Every deliverance, Lord, has
[9:19] already been paid for. Salvation's

[9:24] Lord. We walk in victory, Lord Jesus,
[9:27] because of what you've already done for
[9:29] us. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[9:33] Can we just sing worthy, worthy, worthy
[9:36] the lamb that was slain? As we prepare
[9:37] to go to prayer this morning, let's just
[9:40] lift our voices, saints, give him
[9:42] worship. He's worthy this morning.
[9:44] Hallelujah. Amen. Let's sing in the
[9:46] chorus. Worthy.
[9:48] Oh, worthy.
[9:53] So worthy.
[9:58] Oh, worthy.
[10:01] The lamb
[10:02] that was slain.
[10:06] He is worthy.
[10:11] So
[10:13] worthy.
[10:16] Oh worthy
[10:19] lamb.
[10:21] Oh, hear the cries of the shackle. Oh,
[10:25] and hear the cries
[10:27] of the shackle
[10:30] from the onset
[10:32] of time.
[10:34] From the chains
[10:36] of defeat, there's no king.
[10:42] And see the tears
[10:45] of the broken,
[10:48] the cry
[10:50] of the slave.
[10:54] worthy.
[10:56] Oh, can we stand as we sing this verse?
[10:58] Then the crying is still, the crying
[11:03] is still.
[11:05] And the chorus breaks out. All the
[11:10] shackles
[11:12] released from their chain.
[11:18] Hands down.
[11:20] The voices
[11:22] are swelling
[11:24] the song. They sing worthy
[11:30] that was slain.
[11:34] He is worthy.
[11:38] Oh, so worthy.
[11:44] worthy
[11:46] lamb that was slain.
[11:51] He is worthy
[11:56] for
[12:01] worthy
[12:03] to let
[12:05] sing. I'll praise him. I'll praise him.
[12:08] I will praise him.
[12:13] I will praise him.
[12:17] I will praise
[12:20] the lamb that was saved.
[12:25] Oh, I'll praise.
[12:30] I will praise him.
[12:34] I'll praise
[12:37] the lamb.
[12:39] Oh,
[12:39] &gt;&gt; maybe we can just lift our voices and
[12:41] sing. I love him with just our voices. I
[12:43] love him.
[12:47] I love him.
[12:51] I love
[12:54] the lamb
[12:56] that was slain.
[13:01] I love him.
[13:05] I love him.
[13:10] I love
[13:13] the lamb
[13:15] that was slain.
[13:20] Hallelujah.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord Jesus this morning.
[13:23] He's wonderful. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[13:26] I'm going to ask for brother Tom Ray
[13:28] will come open the service for us in a
[13:30] word of prayer.
[13:32] Amen. We do have a couple requests we
[13:35] want to remember before the Lord this
[13:36] morning.
[13:38] Amen. Do you believe he's here to grant
[13:40] your request this morning? Amen.
[13:43] Brother Milos says, "Last week we prayed
[13:46] for brother Franco and his wife. She got
[13:48] instantly better after we prayed for
[13:50] her." Praise the Lord. The same God.
[13:53] Wonderful. Amen. So, let's just believe
[13:55] for our sister Patty Pettingale. She's
[13:57] homesick today. Requesting prayer for
[13:59] healing. Our brother Richard Drake also
[14:02] asking we would please pray for sister
[14:03] Barb Drake who's also homesick this
[14:05] morning. Amen. And maybe if the brothers
[14:07] would come and prepare for the offering,
[14:10] if there's something on your heart that
[14:11] you would just like to lift before the
[14:12] Lord. Amen. I know that he sees. Brother
[14:16] Bram says it's an act of faith even to
[14:18] raise your hand. Amen. Showing that you
[14:20] believe that God sees that. Amen.
[14:22] Brother Tom, would you come please?
[14:27] How many are approaching God this
[14:28] morning in faith?
[14:30] Faith.
[14:32] Amen. Faith is our victory this morning.
[14:35] We stand on the promises of God for
[14:37] their yay and amen to them that believe.
[14:40] Heavenly Father, we approach your throne
[14:42] of grace with great boldness. We come
[14:45] under the shed blood of the lamb. We
[14:48] come, Lord God, approaching a living God
[14:51] that we can say is the same yesterday,
[14:53] today, and forever. Lord, we've seen
[14:56] victory after victory after victory over
[14:59] these last weeks, months, and years.
[15:01] Lord, as we prayed already this morning,
[15:03] Lord, there's cancers that have been
[15:05] defeated by the power of prayer. There
[15:09] have been souls that have been
[15:10] delivered, Lord, by the power of prayer.
[15:13] And Lord, there's many here this morning
[15:15] that need that presence to come and
[15:18] deliver them and set them free. Lord, we
[15:22] have come to a risen savior. Not a God
[15:24] that's in the tomb, but a God that is a
[15:27] living Lord. A rising savior, Jesus
[15:31] Christ, the living word. We come and we
[15:34] approach your throne of grace. Lord,
[15:37] bless your people, heal your people,
[15:40] deliver your people. You said, ask
[15:42] abundantly that your joy be filled. We
[15:45] pray God that you will meet the need of
[15:48] every brother, every sister that is in
[15:51] the house of faith this morning. Those
[15:54] that have joined by the way of the
[15:55] internet. Lord, I pray that you'll
[15:57] anoint their faith to believe for the
[16:00] impossible. Lord, I remember many years
[16:03] ago, Brother Andy's preaching. You're a
[16:05] supernatural God. So, it's natural for a
[16:08] supernatural God to heal supernaturally.
[16:12] Lord, heal your people. Once again, let
[16:15] the bomb of Gilead come down. Let the
[16:17] revelation of your word come alive to
[16:20] your people. Let this glorious Jesus
[16:22] Christ that has been lifted out of the
[16:24] pages by Malachi 4, Lord, anoint us to
[16:28] believe thus saith the Lord. Would you
[16:31] anoint your servant? Would you anoint
[16:33] brother Ed? Would you anoint our ears to
[16:35] hear what the spirit would say to the
[16:37] church this morning? Let the Holy Ghost
[16:39] move, Lord. Let there be a great baptism
[16:43] of your spirit. Let the children of the
[16:45] Lord rejoice in your presence. God,
[16:49] speak to us divinely, individually,
[16:52] Lord. And we pray now as we take up an
[16:54] offering that it would not be to your
[16:56] glory, and to your honor. Bless those
[16:59] that will give, those that can't bless
[17:01] them abundantly, that they also, Lord,
[17:04] would be able to bless the bride of
[17:06] Christ. Lord, bless now the service, the
[17:09] songs, and the worship. And most of all,
[17:12] when the word comes, may our hearts burn
[17:15] within us as you will speak to us this
[17:17] morning along this way in Jesus' name.
[17:21] Amen.
[17:26] Amen. You may have your seats. My hope
[17:29] is in the Lord. Amen. Do you believe
[17:32] this morning? Jesus said, "Whatsoever
[17:34] you ask in my name, it will be given
[17:37] you." Amen. David says in the Psalms,
[17:39] "Why are you distressed, oh my soul?
[17:41] Hope thou in God." Amen. Why don't we
[17:44] sing the song, "My hope is in the Lord
[17:46] from this time on as we take up the
[17:48] offering." Amen. God bless you once
[17:50] again. We want to greet anyone visiting
[17:51] with us. Just trust that you'll feel at
[17:53] home in the service this morning. Amen.
[17:55] God bless you. I stand in awe.
[18:00] I stand in awe within the presence of
[18:05] the Lord.
[18:08] In whom the wisdom of the aes
[18:24] living sacrifice,
[18:28] the only source of life,
[18:32] my hope
[18:35] is in the Lord. Oh,
[18:40] the sound of
[18:44] the
[18:48] I
[18:55] forever
[18:56] more.
[18:59] His tender mercies come.
[19:02] His tender mercies come with every
[19:06] rising sun
[19:09] to be the sinner
[19:17] to offer healing and forgive
[19:25] and those who trust in him.
[19:30] There are I rest my home
[19:36] is in the
[19:40] des
[19:55] forever.
[19:58] The horse will take in my home. to my
[20:03] soul.
[20:06] Is it Lord
[20:10] I
[20:14] never
[20:18] my own
[20:25] forever.
[20:30] Amen. We're just going to turn our
[20:32] service directly to our pastor, Brother
[20:34] Ed. Amen. We had a couple specials this
[20:36] morning, but we're just going to give
[20:37] Brother Ed all the time he needs this
[20:39] morning. Amen. Are you looking forward
[20:41] to the word?
[20:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. We do have a
[20:44] couple announcements just before our
[20:45] pastor comes. The American donation
[20:47] receipts for income tax are ready for
[20:49] pickup at the church office today. If
[20:51] you do not collect them today, it will
[20:52] be mailed to you. And there's a young
[20:55] people's this Friday, February the 6th
[20:57] at 7:30 here at the church. And also
[21:00] just once again, communion put
[21:02] Washington night at 4:30. Instead of the
[21:04] usual time of 5, we've moved it up to
[21:06] 4:30. Give a little more time for the
[21:08] service. Amen. I trust you're expecting.
[21:10] Amen. As our pastor comes, why don't we
[21:12] sing, I'm amazed that you love me. I'm
[21:14] amazed how you care.
[21:16] Amen.
[21:18] Oh, I'm amazed,
[21:22] Lord, that you love me.
[21:26] Oh, I'm amazed
[21:31] how you care.
[21:34] Through your preious
[21:37] love, I found pardon.
[21:42] And my sins are washed.

[21:54] away.
[21:56] Oh, I

[23:07] Oh, once more I believe that you love
[23:09] me. Lord, I see

[24:21] it all wash away. All I see
[24:27] are

[24:58] all wash away all my sins.
[25:03] are
[25:04] away.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; Let's just give him thanks as we pray
[25:10] together. Heavenly Father, how thankful
[25:13] we are, oh God, that we can stand as
[25:16] recipients of your grace, your mercy,
[25:19] your longsuffering,
[25:21] oh God, and as recipients of eternal
[25:24] life through the atoning blood of Jesus
[25:27] Christ. Thank you for taking our penalty
[25:30] at Calvary. Oh God, we're so thankful
[25:33] for Calvary. We're so thankful for your
[25:36] your children, Lord, that have received
[25:39] this redemption. And now, oh God, how
[25:42] you have manifested and revealed
[25:44] yourself in this hour. I pray you'll
[25:46] take your word this morning, Lord. Take,
[25:49] oh God, your servants. I pray both those
[25:53] that hear and I that have to speak. I
[25:56] pray you will anoint oh God the thoughts
[26:00] and may they not be a human's thoughts
[26:03] may they be your thoughts I pray that
[26:06] your special grace will be upon each one
[26:09] that they will see oh God their place
[26:12] their position and father may they move
[26:15] in that by the guidance and the
[26:17] leadership of the Holy Ghost Father we
[26:20] surrender ourselves to you now and we
[26:23] ask your blessing upon each one that's
[26:25] here in Jesus righteous holy name. Amen.
[26:30] And amen. And everybody could say amen.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; I believe I see brother Ben Drake. Is
[26:38] that right? God bless brother Ben and we
[26:43] followed your testimonies
[26:45] and what God has done for your family.
[26:48] We appreciate that. We're thankful for
[26:50] each one that is here and the the day is
[26:52] a full day. We're having the afternoon
[26:55] service at 4:30,
[26:57] not 5, 4:30 because we are having the
[27:01] Lord's table tonight and foot washing.
[27:04] And we have two baptisms which I think
[27:07] perhaps have already been announced, but
[27:09] we're so happy to have uh our brother
[27:12] Chan that's going to be baptized, Sister
[27:14] Leslie's husband, and uh we're so
[27:18] thankful for that. and uh sister Shakina
[27:21] Bondi, brother Peter and Anna's
[27:24] daughter.
[27:26] I am so thankful whenever I see a young
[27:29] person moved and want to be baptized,
[27:32] not because it's an emotional thing or a
[27:34] bunch of other people are doing it or
[27:36] the family's doing it, but because God
[27:39] has touched something. And then to have
[27:43] uh uh brother Chan when he heard that
[27:46] Sister Lesie and the children were being
[27:49] baptized,
[27:51] he uh sent word when I get back from
[27:54] China, I want to be baptized also.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; So God bless our brother Chan.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God bless Shakina. So that
[28:04] will be taking place tonight as well.
[28:07] We're thankful. It's a it's a moving
[28:12] God's moving. Continue to move.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; It's not a It's not some imagin
[28:18] imaginary thing.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:22] So, while you're standing and we have
[28:24] prayed, we're going to turn to the word
[28:27] and uh I'm continuing on.
[28:31] I'll just remind you, I won't give a
[28:33] summary so much, but I'm going to
[28:35] continue on
[28:37] from the scripture where
[28:41] God said to Moses,
[28:44] Moses said, "I'd like to see your face.
[28:46] Show me your glory."
[28:49] And uh the Lord spoke to him and said,
[28:51] "You can't see my face."
[28:54] Uh it's it's really quite
[28:57] interesting and amazing that in
[29:00] Revelation then the last the last of the
[29:04] seven descriptions of his personage was
[29:07] his face his countenance. That was the
[29:10] last of the seven.
[29:12] And when a person saw met a person face
[29:15] to face that's when you had the most
[29:18] intimate conversation.
[29:20] Now, now there's no secret or mystery or
[29:22] who it is you're dealing with. And uh
[29:25] and in Revelation, that was the one
[29:28] thing that the bridegroom was determined
[29:30] to do is make her know who this is.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; And thus, he would open up the seals and
[29:36] reveal himself and unveil himself and
[29:39] let us see that this is that this is the
[29:41] mighty God.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; In all of his beauty. And so uh but when
[29:47] Moses said I want to see show me your
[29:50] glory and uh brother Tim do spoke about
[29:53] the glory of the Lord and the Lord said
[29:57] behold there is a place by me and thou
[30:01] shalt stand upon a rock. So we spoke
[30:04] about the various places there's
[30:08] your home is a place and you've left
[30:11] there and you've come here and you're in
[30:12] a place. Uh you may have an opportunity
[30:15] and that will be a a certain position in
[30:18] a place or you may be educated to a
[30:22] certain level and and then you are from
[30:25] this place to that place and uh and then
[30:30] the Bible tells us that Jesus was given
[30:33] the book and he found the place
[30:37] where it was written
[30:39] &gt;&gt; and what he read was written of him. And
[30:43] now I'm going to ask you
[30:45] &gt;&gt; if you have found your place
[30:48] &gt;&gt; in the Lamb's book of life. That's what
[30:51] I'm going to be speaking about. Our
[30:53] place in the Lamb's Book of Life. So
[30:56] we'll read some of the same scripture
[31:00] in Luke the 4th chapter
[31:02] and we'll start at verse 16.
[31:13] And if you have difficulty following
[31:17] uh I don't blame you.
[31:21] But I would ask you to seriously
[31:24] uh follow the continuity
[31:27] because I'm going through a lot of
[31:28] different scripture but they are all
[31:31] tied together. So follow the continuity
[31:34] please.
[31:37] And he came to Nazareth where he had
[31:40] been brought up. That's verse 16.
[31:44] And as his custom was, he went into the
[31:47] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[31:50] up for to read. And there was delivered
[31:52] unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[31:56] And when he had opened the book, please
[31:58] notice, he found the place where it was
[32:03] written. The spirit of the Lord is upon
[32:06] me because he hath anointed me to preach
[32:08] the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me
[32:11] to heal the brokenhearted, to preach
[32:14] deliverance to the captives and
[32:16] recovering of sight to the blind, to set
[32:19] at liberty them that are bruised, to
[32:22] preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
[32:25] And if you look back in Isaiah 61, I
[32:28] believe it is, and two, you'll find that
[32:30] he broke the the verse right in half.
[32:33] And he did not refer to the second part
[32:36] of the verse because that was part of
[32:38] his second coming to preach the
[32:41] acceptable year of the Lord. And please
[32:44] notice and he closed the book
[32:49] and gave it to the minister and sat
[32:52] down. And the eyes of all of them that
[32:54] were in the synagogue were fastened on
[32:57] him. And he began to say unto them,
[32:59] "This day is this scripture fulfilled in
[33:03] your ears." The Bible says that they
[33:07] wondered at the gracious words that came
[33:09] out of his lips. And then they said, "Is
[33:13] not this Joseph's son?" Now, because he
[33:16] closed the book, they didn't know who it
[33:19] was that was speaking.
[33:22] Maybe I lost you. I don't think so. He
[33:27] opened the book and he read what he was.
[33:30] He identified himself. Then he closed
[33:33] the book. I don't want to major on that,
[33:34] but he closed the book. But if you just
[33:37] read a few verses down, and then he
[33:39] began to speak and identify God working
[33:43] back there and here. And the Bible says,
[33:46] "And they were filled with wrath."
[33:49] &gt;&gt; That wasn't from the open book.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; I guarantee you that wasn't a result of
[33:53] the open book. They were filled with
[33:56] wrath. They had not recognized him. And
[33:59] he was standing right there.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; So God bless you as you have your seats.
[34:12] Now I have some slides and in in these
[34:16] slides it will be I will be making
[34:19] references to some of the same things
[34:20] we're going to read. But this is to help
[34:23] you get to where I want to get as fast
[34:26] as possible.
[34:28] So, we just dim the lights a wee bit,
[34:30] please. And
[34:35] so, now this is what we're going to be
[34:37] talking about.
[34:39] We have the written book.
[34:43] We have the sealed book.
[34:48] We have the claimed book.
[34:52] And we have the open book.
[34:56] We're be covering those subjects.
[35:01] And I saw in the right hand of him that
[35:03] sat on the throne
[35:06] a book written, a book written within
[35:10] and on the backside, sealed with seven
[35:13] seals.
[35:18] And he came and took the book. He
[35:21] claimed it
[35:23] &gt;&gt; out of the right hand of him that sat
[35:25] upon the throne. And I saw another
[35:27] mighty angel, this is Revelation 10 now,
[35:31] come down from heaven clothed with a
[35:33] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[35:36] and his face was as it were the sun and
[35:38] his feet as pillars of fire. Prophet
[35:41] says all the way through that's Christ.
[35:43] Amen.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; So now he's now it's the same Christ
[35:47] when he was here on earth. He found the
[35:50] place in the book.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Now he's descending and coming coming
[35:56] with a certain purpose and he had in his
[35:58] hand a little book open. Now it's not
[36:01] closed.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; It's not only written.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; It's not only taken and claimed.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; It's not only opened. It's not but it
[36:12] but now he's going to reveal it. And he
[36:14] set his right foot upon the sea and his
[36:17] left foot on the earth. So now we won't
[36:21] get lost in that. You young people, you
[36:23] just listen close and we'll follow these
[36:26] other Revelation 20 uh chapter 20. Now
[36:30] we're at the end of this book
[36:34] and the one you have in your hand. We're
[36:36] getting to the closing of it to chapter
[36:40] 20 11 and 12. And I saw a great white
[36:43] throne and him that sat on it, from
[36:46] whose face the earth and the heaven fled
[36:50] away, and there was found no place for
[36:54] them.
[36:58] And I saw the dead, small and great,
[37:01] stand before God, and the books were
[37:03] opened. And another book was opened,
[37:07] which is the book of life. And the dead
[37:09] were judged out of those things which
[37:12] were written in the books according to
[37:15] their works.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Here's what brother Brandham said now.
[37:24] And this I believe is none other. This
[37:26] is in the invisible union.
[37:29] Union.
[37:30] God wants to unite you.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. into an invisible union. We don't
[37:36] have a book for you to sign out there.
[37:38] We don't have a fellowship card for you
[37:41] to sign. But this is a union.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; He wants to have a union. There's a
[37:47] place by him.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; He's inviting you to a place.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Make yourself known to me, Lord. Reveal
[37:53] yourself to me. And he'd like to say to
[37:56] you, there is a place
[37:58] &gt;&gt; by me. And thou shalt stand upon a rock.
[38:04] Life is a sacred thing to God and it's
[38:07] recorded in a book. Book of life. Life
[38:11] is a sacred thing. God is the author of
[38:15] life. I'd like you to notice author as
[38:18] well.
[38:20] He said, "Do you believe that our
[38:21] natural life here we have is just a
[38:25] perversion. That's why you have so much
[38:28] trouble with it.
[38:30] It really should be the right life to
[38:32] begin with. But it was perverted by
[38:35] natural birth.
[38:39] Your name of your first nature that was
[38:41] a natural birth was born and put in a in
[38:46] a book of life. All your deeds were
[38:50] wrote in it too. Everything you done
[38:53] under that nature was put in a book
[38:57] called the book of life.
[39:02] Well, you se
[39:06] while you separated from your first
[39:08] union
[39:09] by spiritual death. Now you are born
[39:13] again or remarried again to the new
[39:17] spiritual union of not your natural life
[39:20] of the things of the world but of
[39:23] eternal life. That germ that was in you
[39:26] at the beginning found you.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; It's gone before you were born. That
[39:32] it's the seed that was in you. The germ
[39:35] that was in you at the beginning found
[39:38] you. Now that's now is different. Now
[39:42] your old book is gone
[39:46] with your old union and now your name of
[39:50] your old in your and he breaks it has
[39:54] been transferred. Now you say do you
[39:57] mean to tell me that my old book he said
[40:00] God put it in the sea of his
[40:02] forgetfulness.
[40:04] You stand perfectly before God.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Now your name is in the new book.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Not the book of life, but the lamb's
[40:14] book of life. It sounds like two books,
[40:17] but he said the same book and one runs
[40:20] out to the other like a stock of wheat.
[40:22] It's not a little blade anymore. It's
[40:24] not just a stock anymore. It's not just
[40:26] a head anymore. But now it's a full
[40:29] mature wheat within the husk. And now
[40:32] your name is in the new book. Not the
[40:34] book of life, but the lamb's book of
[40:36] life. What the lamb redeemed. That's
[40:39] what changed it. Say, not the old book
[40:42] of your o of of your natural union, but
[40:46] your new bride. He says, hallelujah.
[40:49] Your new life is in the lamb's book of
[40:52] life. Your marriage certificate.
[40:55] Hallelujah. where your true eternal germ
[40:59] from the beginning takes hold. Now
[41:02] you're not only forgiven, but you're
[41:04] justified.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:10] I think that's as far as I want to go
[41:12] there.
[41:14] Yes. I'll leave that last one, please.
[41:19] So that gives you the theme.
[41:24] I want to say that every book
[41:28] is uh written by an author.
[41:31] There has to be an author to a book.
[41:35] Uh and there are different categories of
[41:37] books.
[41:39] I had a wonderful experience this last
[41:42] week
[41:44] and I I I trust that God will share some
[41:47] of that with you. Not in my speaking but
[41:50] in his presence. I had a very very
[41:53] unexpected visitation, unexpected
[41:56] visitor. It was him.
[41:59] I was just reading something. I was just
[42:01] in my middle of my studies
[42:03] and I felt that I need to tell you this
[42:07] and uh it's just as
[42:10] common and
[42:12] uneventful as it is perhaps right this
[42:14] morning. And I was just sitting in front
[42:17] of my computer and I was I started to
[42:20] read uh a few lines in a in a message
[42:24] because I was looking up this part right
[42:27] now. I said, "Well, there's different
[42:30] categories of a book.
[42:32] There's uh and every book has an author.
[42:40] There's books of fiction and
[42:43] non-fiction.
[42:45] And they say that fiction is something
[42:48] imaginary.
[42:50] Fiction is something that's been
[42:52] contrived and dreamed up in a person's
[42:56] mind.
[42:57] And it concerns events, imaginary events
[43:02] and imaginary people. And I thought
[43:08] I come from the mind of God.
[43:11] And the presence, the presence of the
[43:14] author just enveloped me.
[43:18] And I bowed my head in that holy sacred
[43:22] presence. And I began to weep.
[43:26] And then then different songs came to my
[43:29] mind. And I was in a state of almost
[43:34] euphoria of some kind for about two
[43:37] hours.
[43:38] I tell you friend, he's a real person.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; It's not just a dead dry book.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; This message that we talk about is a
[43:46] living person.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; He's called Jesus Christ.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; And the message that I started to read
[43:55] was, "What think ye of Christ?
[44:00] And we haven't got time this morning,
[44:02] but you go home and get that.
[44:05] It was 1953 in Chicago.
[44:09] And he asked the people and he said,
[44:12] "This is what they said of him. What do
[44:14] you think of Christ?" This is what his
[44:17] friends said. This is what his enemies
[44:20] said. Now we go through what his enemies
[44:22] said of him. And they all testified of
[44:25] Christ. And he goes all through and now
[44:29] to the people. What think ye of Christ?
[44:37] He was in the message of testimony of
[44:40] telling of the raising of the dead
[44:44] boy in Finland. I had a man in my home
[44:47] that visited that boy. He now was a
[44:50] policeman
[44:52] in the uh patrol patrol policeman in
[44:57] Finland.
[44:58] And brother Nino, I believe it was, who
[45:02] was actually living with at my daughter
[45:05] Marilyn and her husband Mike at the time
[45:09] on the island. He was living in their
[45:11] basement. And we had him over for
[45:13] Christmas and he took the picture of the
[45:15] boy out. He said, "Have you seen this?"
[45:17] I said, "Of course." That's the boy that
[45:19] was raised from the dead in Finland. He
[45:21] said, "Well, I was just visiting him in
[45:23] Finland." And he said, "He's a policeman
[45:26] now." And he's the boy that was raised
[45:29] from the dead. Brother Brandham is
[45:31] telling the account of when the boy was
[45:34] struck, two boys on a bicycle.
[45:38] And the woman,
[45:41] a sister in her work in Finland, met the
[45:46] woman whose husband drove that car that
[45:50] struck the bicycle.
[45:54] I haven't time to go into it, but
[45:57] brother Brandham said, "When I when I
[45:59] got out and looked at the little fellow,
[46:01] I tell you, I thought my heart would
[46:04] break. I started to go away like that.
[46:08] said, "Now, this sounds like fiction,
[46:13] but it isn't, friends.
[46:17] There are things in this message that
[46:19] sound like it's fiction,
[46:21] &gt;&gt; because it's of another place.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; If it's it's another realm, it's another
[46:26] world. It's another power. It's another
[46:28] being,
[46:30] &gt;&gt; not of this world.
[46:32] And you cannot take it into a human mind
[46:35] and think that you're going to
[46:36] understand it all. It's it the prophet
[46:39] said it'd be even for God to make
[46:41] himself known and be too mystical. You
[46:43] wouldn't be able to understand it. It
[46:44] sounds like it's mystery almost and it
[46:47] is to this life. But it's a real person.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; And I want to declare to you today he's
[46:54] able to come to you personally
[46:56] &gt;&gt; to your place to your seat where you are
[46:59] today. Don't put it somewhere else. It's
[47:03] not somewhere else. He's everpresent.
[47:06] He's Jesus Christ, the same yesterday
[47:09] and today, always today and forever. You
[47:13] believe that? He knows exactly where you
[47:16] are. He knows exactly what you need. And
[47:19] as I said last time I spoke on this.
[47:22] There were people who came before the
[47:23] prophet of God who thought they had a
[47:25] certain need. But then he said, "But
[47:28] your real need is you're not saved. Your
[47:32] real need is you need the Holy Ghost."
[47:34] And he identified the real need. They
[47:37] thought it was the arthritis or the TB
[47:40] or something else. But your real need, I
[47:43] thank God he knows our real need today.
[47:51] And in this what thinking of Christ he
[47:53] says then I can hear the angels. He was
[47:55] describing the marriage supper and it
[47:58] was right at this moment that the
[48:01] presence of the author came in
[48:04] and then he says I hear the angels move
[48:07] back and bow their heads
[48:10] and I look and come out walking yonder
[48:12] from behind those doors. There he comes,
[48:16] the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords,
[48:21] walk down along the table and wiping
[48:24] each one's eyes and putting his arm
[48:28] around them and say, "Now, don't cry.
[48:32] It's all over now. All of them is here.
[48:36] There's not any of them gone.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; They're all here.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Now, enter into the joys of the Lord."
[48:44] He said, "I know my heart jumps when I
[48:48] think of it."
[48:51] &gt;&gt; He just exactly how you are. He's in a
[48:53] body like you. You know, prophet of God
[48:56] just has the same troubles and problems
[48:59] everybody has. But he's in a place where
[49:01] he says, "Oh, my heart just jumps when I
[49:04] think of it."
[49:05] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's not a little fiction
[49:08] story
[49:10] of Santa Claus." He said, "That's thus
[49:13] saith the Lord."
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Tell you, there's a big difference
[49:17] between a fiction story and thus sayaith
[49:21] the Lord.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; And this th this sayith the Lord may
[49:24] sound fiction, but it's not fiction,
[49:27] friends.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; And he says that's the seed that's right
[49:33] now becoming materialized right now. It
[49:36] it's moving in.
[49:39] Friends, my thoughts have gone into such
[49:44] directions. I trust I can make it real
[49:47] to you. But that's the seed. I will just
[49:51] drop this in. He said that's the seed
[50:00] that's becoming materialized right now.
[50:04] It's moving in. Well, I just want to
[50:07] just drop something in that I hope I'll
[50:09] come back to later on.
[50:12] Whether you young people are in school
[50:15] or whether some of you are in other
[50:17] higher grade, higher places of education
[50:22] or whether you are in a church, you're
[50:24] hearing a word. Words are seeds.
[50:28] You're going to be the product of what
[50:30] you hear. If you hear unbelief, you'll
[50:33] be an unbeliever.
[50:34] If you hear doubt, you'll be a doubter.
[50:37] If you hear faith, you'll be faithfilled
[50:40] with faith. If you hear those things
[50:43] that have been revealed, it will be
[50:45] materialized within you.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; And the book had to be open to bring
[50:52] forth another germitized seed for the
[50:55] people of this age that they might
[50:57] receive that seed.
[51:00] Not a dead denominational seed, but that
[51:03] seed.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? There are multitudes of
[51:07] people today in churches everywhere. And
[51:09] you might say, "Well, do you think that
[51:12] you that you have it? We better have it.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; You better have it. You better have that
[51:19] confidence. You better know in whom
[51:21] you've believed." The apostle says, "We
[51:23] are not of those." They knew who they
[51:26] were. They knew who they heard. You have
[51:29] to know where you stand. You have to
[51:32] know that you're in the right place at
[51:34] the right time and you have the right
[51:37] person
[51:38] made known to you. This is not some
[51:41] Jesus of history. This is a Jesus Christ
[51:44] that's revealed himself that took this
[51:47] book into his hand, opened it, and sent
[51:50] the word down through his vindicated
[51:53] messenger. He spoke the word. We receive
[51:56] that word. And you are a transformed
[51:59] person by that word.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; That's how it happens. And it doesn't
[52:04] happen. That's God's program.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Every book has an author. As I said a
[52:12] moment ago, and in the rapture message,
[52:16] he said the book of Revelation is the
[52:18] last book of the Bible. It's sealed to
[52:20] unbelievers.
[52:22] In there the Bible says in 22nd chapter
[52:27] whosoever shall take one word from it or
[52:29] add one word I'll take his part from the
[52:32] book of life. We realize that then it is
[52:36] altogether given for believers.
[52:39] I have this underlined and it opens the
[52:42] book of revelation and reveals the
[52:45] author.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Let the church say praise God.
[52:53] It reveals the author
[52:58] &gt;&gt; of this entire book.
[53:01] And he's the one. He's the alpha and the
[53:02] omega from Genesis to Revelation in
[53:05] modern events
[53:08] made clear by prophecy. It's two days
[53:11] later. He says, "And this book is the
[53:14] book of prophecy.
[53:17] Its believers are commanded to honor it
[53:20] &gt;&gt; and to read it
[53:22] &gt;&gt; and to believe its author.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're commanded to read
[53:28] it, to honor it, and to believe its
[53:31] author.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Every book has an author.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; We don't just have some doctrine. We
[53:36] have a book that has an author.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus, when he was here,
[53:45] John spoke of it. He said, "No man has
[53:47] seen God at any time. The only begotten
[53:50] son which is in the bosom of the father
[53:54] hath declared him."
[53:56] So now
[53:58] I want to I want to just enter into the
[54:01] subject please
[54:03] that the author to declare the author
[54:07] by displaying the fullness of God
[54:11] proving that he was God not a second
[54:14] person or a third person but the person
[54:24] &gt;&gt; and brother Brown takes a little drama
[54:26] and now I want to use that which I've
[54:27] used before.
[54:29] He said let's see
[54:32] coming out of space
[54:34] where there's nothing. Let's make it a
[54:36] little white light because he said you
[54:39] couldn't understand. You can't
[54:40] comprehend God. So he's helping us.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; A little white light. Uh he said that
[54:47] went out like a mystic light, like a
[54:50] halo.
[54:52] That that was the logos that went out
[54:55] from God in the beginning. That was the
[54:58] son of God that came out of the bosom of
[55:01] the father.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; So now every book has to have an author.
[55:08] I'm speaking about your place in the
[55:11] lamb's book of life. There's no book
[55:14] like that on earth.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; The lamb's book of life. the book that
[55:20] has no sin in it.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; The lamb has paid the sin total judgment
[55:26] price and the people whose names are in
[55:29] that book are completely and totally
[55:33] sinless and justified.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; So much so that you never did it in the
[55:38] first place. And he would send a prophet
[55:40] messenger here to declare it to a
[55:43] certain people. You never did it in the
[55:45] first place. And he might say it to a
[55:47] whole group and one will say I can't
[55:49] believe that and sir you carry your sin
[55:52] with you. Other one says I believe that.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; By believing that
[56:00] &gt;&gt; we have faith in what he has spoken
[56:02] &gt;&gt; and what he's done.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; And out of the bosom of the father he
[56:07] said that was
[56:09] that was what was in the beginning was
[56:11] the word.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the word was with God,
[56:15] and the word was God, and the word was
[56:18] made flesh, and dwelt among us. In the
[56:22] beginning was God, and there and then
[56:24] out from God came the logos, a part of
[56:27] God that went out of God. What am I
[56:30] talking about? I'm talking about the
[56:31] author.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; This was the author.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; He spake and said, "Let there be light."
[56:41] And there was nothing. And there was
[56:43] nothing but there was something happened
[56:45] and an atom turned there and began to
[56:49] whirl around this way. And the sun begin
[56:53] to come into existence
[56:55] because he said let there be
[56:58] when the prophet was speaking on uh what
[57:02] thinking of Christ. He said nature
[57:05] declared who he was. The sun stopped
[57:08] shining and the earth belched at the
[57:12] very death of the Christ and his
[57:14] resurrection.
[57:16] I tell you what, friends, everything has
[57:18] testified of him.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Let there be.
[57:23] He said, and because he said, let there
[57:26] be, there's the authority.
[57:29] And I can see a piece fly off.
[57:34] Uh, it's a meteor, a meteor. After a few
[57:37] million years or a hundred billions of
[57:40] years, if you want to call it, it's
[57:43] circled way out. I see him standing
[57:46] there watching it and it falls down
[57:51] here. He said he stops it after it
[57:54] falls. Now, this sounds fiction, but
[57:57] it's not.
[58:02] and let it hang there in orbit.
[58:05] Here goes another one flying off the
[58:08] sun. It goes over here and hangs down.
[58:13] Stops it there. Said, "What's he doing?"
[58:18] He's writing his first Bible.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Who is God? He said, "Who is God?" Are
[58:27] you with me, folks?
[58:29] Who is God? The one that stood there and
[58:32] rolled stars off of his hands and rolled
[58:37] worlds out of his hands and made the
[58:39] things which do not appear deity and
[58:43] deity himself lives in man. Do you
[58:46] believe that deity himself lives in man?
[58:51] He made he made heavens and earth and he
[58:54] lives in mankind. Why? No wonder
[58:57] cripples when you realize that they can
[59:00] straighten out and the creator's here.
[59:03] No wonder blind. Look where he's gone.
[59:05] Look where prophets gone in just a few
[59:08] moments of time. He's gone from a little
[59:10] white halo coming out of out of nothing.
[59:14] Uh coming out of God and saying that's
[59:17] identifies that that's the son of God.
[59:19] Uh that's the that's the son of God.
[59:22] That's the logos. That's the word of
[59:24] God. And that word came down and became
[59:27] flesh. And we and manifested that God.
[59:31] He had to manifest where he came from.
[59:34] Who is that? I'm saying today, he's the
[59:36] author
[59:38] &gt;&gt; and the finisher of our faith.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; And he's writing his first Bible. And
[59:46] now he comes right down. He said,
[59:48] "That's why cripples straighten out. The
[59:50] creator is here. No wonder the blind can
[59:53] see and opens up. The creator's here.
[59:57] And this is what I'm saying today.
[59:59] That's not back there. The creator is
[1:00:01] here.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; All things are possible.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; The author is one. He's a maker of
[1:00:14] anything.
[1:00:19] The author is a creator or an
[1:00:22] originator.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; The author of the book came himself to
[1:00:26] live out those prophecies
[1:00:29] that were written of him
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; and he fulfilled them. No wonder he
[1:00:33] could find his place.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; In the book of Isaiah. And no wonder he
[1:00:38] knew where to start reading and where to
[1:00:40] stop reading. And then he closed the
[1:00:42] book and the book remained closed.
[1:00:46] There were some that believed on him and
[1:00:49] they couldn't understand it, but they
[1:00:50] believed. And the author had the book in
[1:00:53] his hand. No wonder he knew. And the man
[1:00:55] who even brought the brought the book to
[1:00:58] him. He didn't realize that he was going
[1:01:00] to be put in the he was playing a part
[1:01:03] of the story, but he didn't even know
[1:01:05] what he was doing.
[1:01:08] And he didn't know the one who that was
[1:01:10] standing there was going to take the
[1:01:12] scroll and find his own place in that
[1:01:15] book.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Now you'll get some idea of what the
[1:01:21] message is.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ coming from the bosom of
[1:01:27] the father full of grace and truth. And
[1:01:30] I want to say this book
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; has no falsehood in it.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. This book has no questions in it.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; It is not that the human speaks every
[1:01:43] word just intellectually correct and
[1:01:46] politically correct. Please listen to
[1:01:49] this. You that go and get educated and
[1:01:52] have gone through years of university
[1:01:54] etc. That's not what this book, this
[1:01:56] book didn't go, this book didn't come to
[1:01:59] earth to go through university filter
[1:02:02] and come out just exactly right. This
[1:02:05] book came out to reveal the author and
[1:02:09] it's the revelation of him. You may have
[1:02:12] one revelation not different. It won't
[1:02:14] be opposing but it will produce life and
[1:02:18] changing power, transforming power in
[1:02:21] you. And it will do the same thing in
[1:02:24] me. And it's absolutely pure.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely true.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; And there's no falsehood in it.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:02:41] among us. And we beheld his glory, the
[1:02:44] glory as of the only begotten of the
[1:02:47] father, full of grace and truth.
[1:02:52] That's who he is.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; There's no falsehood here.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; And then now I just take another
[1:03:02] section.
[1:03:04] Every
[1:03:06] one included in the book of life
[1:03:11] and those who were transferred to the
[1:03:14] lamb's book of life by faith in his
[1:03:17] work.
[1:03:22] And we are here this morning. And those
[1:03:25] that are streaming,
[1:03:27] and there are many that are streaming,
[1:03:31] perhaps 150, 160 or more now live
[1:03:36] because of the time zone. And we greet
[1:03:38] you all in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:40] Christ.
[1:03:43] And we appreciate your letters
[1:03:46] come from Europe, different places.
[1:03:49] the south, Mexico, wherever,
[1:03:53] New Zealand, the other part of the
[1:03:55] world.
[1:03:56] And because brother Murphy is
[1:03:59] translating,
[1:04:00] there'll be those from China that are
[1:04:02] about 16 hours ahead
[1:04:05] from here. And I I say to you, we
[1:04:09] appreciate your letters. You send them
[1:04:12] to us.
[1:04:13] And uh for you that don't know because
[1:04:16] we don't announce it, we very rarely
[1:04:18] ever ever speak of it. I think this is
[1:04:20] perhaps the first or second time I ever
[1:04:22] mentioned it. But in the usually the
[1:04:25] week following
[1:04:28] the archive s the the streaming service,
[1:04:31] the week following is usually up to
[1:04:35] another anywhere from 3 to 400 locations
[1:04:39] within one week and then it continues
[1:04:42] on. We don't know anything about the
[1:04:45] future of that. But we're thankful that
[1:04:48] there are others that join you here that
[1:04:50] are seated here.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; And every age,
[1:04:55] there's part of the book
[1:04:57] that's for every age.
[1:05:02] And Jesus had to find his place in
[1:05:05] Isaiah.
[1:05:08] And then he had to then he identified a
[1:05:11] spot that was about him.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Now he happens to be the main theme of
[1:05:18] the whole Bible.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; But somewhere in here
[1:05:24] is your part.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; So there's a whole part for an age and
[1:05:32] then there's a part for the people in
[1:05:34] that age. Amen.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; And now just hold that close. And then
[1:05:39] he said, "How that will be, how you will
[1:05:42] know that is when the people of that age
[1:05:46] when they see it vindicated,
[1:05:50] they see or hear it was vindicated. It
[1:05:53] was proven." In other words, the author
[1:05:56] came on the scene and said, "This is not
[1:05:58] someone else. This is me. This is the
[1:06:01] author." And then you as an individual.
[1:06:05] Now I'm coming right to your address.
[1:06:07] There's something inside that sparks.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; You can't explain it. It just happens.
[1:06:15] Something the light strikes the seed. We
[1:06:17] can have all kinds of things. I don't
[1:06:19] know what happened, but something
[1:06:21] something came over me. I just began to
[1:06:24] weep or I I came to an altar. I I don't
[1:06:27] understand what happened, but I was
[1:06:30] changed from then. My desires change. My
[1:06:33] appetites change. The things I once
[1:06:36] loved, I begin to hate. And the things I
[1:06:38] hated, now I love. And the people that
[1:06:41] spoke about these things, they became my
[1:06:44] people. They became my brothers. I
[1:06:46] became this. They became my family.
[1:06:49] Yeah. Something's happened, friends.
[1:06:52] This isn't a fiction. This is what the
[1:06:54] book talks about. That's a revelation.
[1:06:58] And no one can ever argue you out of
[1:07:00] that. No one can ever take it away from
[1:07:02] you. It's a revelation of the author.
[1:07:06] Not because everything was nicely said
[1:07:09] or everything was uh everything was in
[1:07:12] in in keeping and reconciling with what
[1:07:15] you used to believe. That's not it.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; That's not it at all. It's a it it's
[1:07:21] just something divine. It's something
[1:07:24] most glorious.
[1:07:26] It's a bridegroom making himself known
[1:07:29] to the bride. And we don't understand
[1:07:32] that even in life. We don't understand
[1:07:34] the the mystery of love and the mystery
[1:07:36] of the union of the marriage even in
[1:07:40] this world. But it's only a type of a
[1:07:42] much greater thing that's happening.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; And so now individuals have I must hurry
[1:07:51] because I would like to just
[1:07:54] convey this to you. He said each age had
[1:07:57] its allotted allotment of word to be
[1:08:01] fulfilled. It's one sentence out of the
[1:08:03] unfailing words of promise. And then in
[1:08:06] the future home of the heavenly
[1:08:08] bridegroom and the earthly bride speaks
[1:08:10] of you. He said there are many that are
[1:08:14] sick and needy in the land and they
[1:08:16] haven't completed their journey. and our
[1:08:19] great enemy, not only our enemies in
[1:08:22] prayer, but he said, "Your enemy,
[1:08:25] your enemy has come to beset them and to
[1:08:28] stop their life and to send them to a
[1:08:31] premature grave." He said, "And we're
[1:08:34] asking for them today that you in your
[1:08:38] mercy and grace, Lord, will extend their
[1:08:42] days to the allotted time."
[1:08:46] You have a claim on the allotted time
[1:08:50] and Satan may come and try to make you
[1:08:52] ill. He may try to bring some
[1:08:55] debilitating disease upon you. You have
[1:08:58] a right to healing.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus paid for your healing.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; You have a right to fulfill your
[1:09:04] allotted time.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; And there's something that God is
[1:09:08] expecting of you. And God allotted his
[1:09:11] word to each age. And as that age comes
[1:09:14] along, here's my key now and your key.
[1:09:17] And as that age comes along, he sends
[1:09:21] someone there to vindicate that word and
[1:09:25] prove that it's true.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Thus, you have the someone coming in
[1:09:29] this age saying hundreds and hundreds of
[1:09:32] times, is it true? Is it true? Is it
[1:09:35] true? Did you ever hear one say, no,
[1:09:37] it's false? No. They always said it's
[1:09:39] true. It's true. It's true. Why? Because
[1:09:42] that same voice had to take this word
[1:09:45] and even though he spoke things we do
[1:09:47] not understand, we have to say it's
[1:09:49] true. It's true.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Let this entire congregation say it's
[1:09:57] true.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Let's say it again.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, doesn't it sound wonderful? It's
[1:10:03] true and it works.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a word of power.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; It's a transforming power. It's got
[1:10:12] enough power to transform your body and
[1:10:15] change the atoms from this world and
[1:10:19] this flesh to an immortal realm.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do we believe unto that?
[1:10:25] Yes, we do.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Every person
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; is allotted a certain number of years
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; and our deeds are written in a book.
[1:10:40] And the word, he said in the message, a
[1:10:43] token, the word has been quickened to
[1:10:46] you.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; This is a key. I've I I labored over
[1:10:50] this key. My wife says, "It's not really
[1:10:54] fair. You spent so many hours
[1:10:57] and all these brothers spent hours and
[1:11:00] we have maybe an hour and a half to
[1:11:02] deliver it. So, we do our best.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; You pray that God will take that
[1:11:09] and quicken it to you. He said, "And the
[1:11:12] word has been quickened to you by the
[1:11:16] Holy Spirit to vindicate this age." So
[1:11:20] when you hear the message or the word of
[1:11:23] this age, well, you say, "Well, h I
[1:11:26] don't know if I've heard anything." Oh,
[1:11:27] come on. You've heard all kinds of
[1:11:29] things. You've heard the Godhead like
[1:11:32] you never heard it before. You've heard
[1:11:34] the baptism like you never heard it
[1:11:35] before. You heard about the serpent seed
[1:11:38] that you never heard anywhere else.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Is it true? It is true.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when the Holy Spirit
[1:11:47] comes and and and quickens to you the
[1:11:50] the message of the hour, that quickening
[1:11:54] means you are selected and elected one
[1:11:58] for that.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:03] You're finding your place
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; in the book.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; And then I'll read this quickly because
[1:12:09] it's what I already had on the screen.
[1:12:12] Life is sacred thing to God and it's
[1:12:15] recorded in a book.
[1:12:20] It's recorded in the book. God is the
[1:12:22] author of life.
[1:12:25] And do you believe that our natural life
[1:12:27] here we have is just a perversion. Now
[1:12:30] you see that the perversion that's in
[1:12:32] the book of life
[1:12:34] everything's recorded in that book and
[1:12:37] we may each one of us there's no holy
[1:12:41] person around here. Jesus condemned
[1:12:44] everybody when he said when a and when a
[1:12:47] man looks on a woman to lust after her,
[1:12:49] he hath committed adultery with her
[1:12:52] in his heart. And you stand the prophet
[1:12:56] comes and says, "And a woman may dress.
[1:12:59] You may be as pure as a lily to your
[1:13:02] husband, but are you dressed so that to
[1:13:05] attract a man to lust after you? You'll
[1:13:08] stand before God as a prostitute."
[1:13:11] Aren't you glad? that I can say and you
[1:13:14] can believe
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; the author of this book
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; said I'll not marry a forgiven woman.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; I'll not marry just one that I have
[1:13:24] forgiven. I shall only marry a virgin.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; And how can I do that? because I'm the
[1:13:30] creator and I will recreate
[1:13:34] those that I have elected and their sins
[1:13:37] I will remember no more and they shall
[1:13:40] be buried in the sea of God's
[1:13:42] forgetfulness
[1:13:43] his own forgetfulness and they will not
[1:13:46] be remembered anymore and I will create
[1:13:48] them a virgin bride and I will come and
[1:13:52] unite myself with her and I will speak
[1:13:56] forth thus saith the Lord a perfect word
[1:14:00] and she will believe that word and she
[1:14:03] will be pregnantated with the revealed
[1:14:06] word of God.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; That's a different kind of a book.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Now it's a lamb's book of life
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; revealed to the bride.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; And now she's pregnantated with that
[1:14:23] kind of word.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; It's not a fiction friends. may sound
[1:14:28] like fictions. It's not fiction. It's
[1:14:31] fact.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; For your name of your first nature was
[1:14:38] born and put on a book. And after all
[1:14:42] all our deeds was wrote on it,
[1:14:44] everything you done under the nature was
[1:14:48] put in the book called the book of life.
[1:14:52] Now he said your old book is gone with
[1:14:55] your old union.
[1:14:57] If you have to read Romans 7 and the
[1:15:00] scripture says that a woman that is
[1:15:02] bound to a man is bound by the law of
[1:15:05] her husband as long as her husband
[1:15:08] liveth.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; But it says but if her husband is dead
[1:15:13] then she is free from the law of her
[1:15:15] husband and spiritually speaking not
[1:15:18] physically but spiritually speaking.
[1:15:21] Spiritually speaking, Jesus took our sin
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; which came by our first union
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; by a perverted life.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; He took that to Calvary and he took it
[1:15:35] to death.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; He didn't just take it and and and and
[1:15:39] drink some strong drink. He took it to
[1:15:42] death and he went to the tomb to break
[1:15:45] your union so that I could stand behind
[1:15:49] this pulpit and tell you you are free
[1:15:51] from that union.
[1:15:55] And that enemy that tries to tell you
[1:15:58] you're still part of that old union. You
[1:16:01] can you have every right to tell him you
[1:16:04] are a liar and my husband speaks the
[1:16:07] truth.
[1:16:08] My husband went to the cross.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My husband went to death and
[1:16:15] my husband rose from the dead.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; And because of that, I am a free person.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:32] He said just like last night I was
[1:16:34] speaking when you get the books you're
[1:16:37] going to see maybe a little confusion
[1:16:40] there. What I said the two books of life
[1:16:43] it's the same book
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; that's called in works is faith
[1:16:48] expressed. It's the same book, but the
[1:16:50] one of them is your natural birth and
[1:16:54] the other one is your spiritual birth.
[1:16:57] One leads out to the other just like a
[1:17:00] stock of wheat.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; So, it's the same book. It's a book of
[1:17:04] life. You're the same person, but you
[1:17:06] had a book of life and all your deeds
[1:17:08] are recorded in that book. Then came the
[1:17:11] lamb of God and he had to show John not
[1:17:14] on earth but he showed him after he had
[1:17:17] ascended and he showed it and he showed
[1:17:20] him and it and the heavens were open and
[1:17:23] he sees one and I'm going to come to it
[1:17:25] now. He sees one sitting on a throne
[1:17:29] with a book in his hand
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; and no man can open the book.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; And the prophet declares that John
[1:17:38] begins to weep because all is lost. All
[1:17:40] is lost cuz the book is closed. And
[1:17:44] there's no man worthy. And they search
[1:17:45] through heaven. And they search through
[1:17:48] earth.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Moses, Elijah aren't worthy. Gabriel is
[1:17:53] not worthy. The angels aren't worthy.
[1:17:56] Have never touched sin, but they're not
[1:17:59] worthy to take this book. And and and
[1:18:03] one and John was weeping. Don't weep.
[1:18:06] And the prophet said his weeping lasted
[1:18:08] for just a moment because the voice
[1:18:11] said, don't weep, John, the lion of the
[1:18:14] tribe of Judah. That speaks of the end
[1:18:17] time. The lion of the tribe of Judah. He
[1:18:20] is a prophet, priest, and king. He's the
[1:18:24] same one prophet as a as a on a son of
[1:18:28] man. He's a prophet. He is a son of God
[1:18:31] as in the Holy Spirit. This dispensation
[1:18:34] of the Holy Spirit. And he's the son of
[1:18:37] God. He's the son of God and the son of
[1:18:39] David in the millennium.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; The lion of the tribe of Judah. He is
[1:18:45] the lion. He is the eagle.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; He's the man. He's all of them.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; He's the same person. Have you followed
[1:18:54] that that far?
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The lion of the tribe of
[1:18:57] Judah,
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; the he has he prevailed to open the
[1:19:01] seals. And John turns to look to see the
[1:19:05] lion and he sees a lamb as it had been
[1:19:08] slain
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; because that was the process without the
[1:19:12] slaying of the lamb. There was no one
[1:19:15] worthy to claim the book. He had to be a
[1:19:17] slain lamb to take the book. had to be a
[1:19:20] lion because it was at that time it was
[1:19:23] at the end of the age the lion of the
[1:19:25] tribe of Judah because now comes a
[1:19:27] messenger at the end where it's fading
[1:19:30] out from the Jew from the Gentiles going
[1:19:33] back to the Jews and under the Jews he
[1:19:36] deals with the Jews as a nation he deals
[1:19:39] with Israel as a nation even says one
[1:19:42] place in the bride I have it here that
[1:19:44] he says there will be Arabians and
[1:19:46] there'll be Indians and there'll be all
[1:19:48] different because they're all kinds of
[1:19:50] peoples and he even mentions Jews. There
[1:19:53] could be Jews as individuals. But when
[1:19:55] he deals with Israel, he deals with them
[1:19:57] as a nation. And now the prophet says
[1:20:00] that this is the end. This is the last
[1:20:02] sign.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; children.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; We're living in the age of the last
[1:20:09] sign.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; We've had You've had the sign of the
[1:20:14] Messiah. Amen.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; You have lived and your allotted time is
[1:20:18] in the time of the sign of the
[1:20:21] resurrection
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; and there'll be no more sign. Let us not
[1:20:25] be even less than say Tommy Osbborne.
[1:20:30] Tommy Osburn said at brother Brandham's
[1:20:33] memorial, he said, and it was a rebuke
[1:20:36] to some of the people who claimed to be
[1:20:38] believers. He said, "You'll not see this
[1:20:40] again."
[1:20:42] He said, "I may be misunderstood, but
[1:20:45] God walked amongst us."
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; And that's what the prophet is saying.
[1:20:52] It's deity in human's flesh. It's deity
[1:20:56] in your flesh. If you can believe that,
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; do you believe that?
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say it's true?
[1:21:09] from the Gentiles back. This just to
[1:21:12] give you some understanding. I'm going
[1:21:13] to go I'm going to go over it real
[1:21:15] quickly. From the Gentiles back to the
[1:21:17] Jews said, remember he deals with Israel
[1:21:20] as a nation always.
[1:21:22] It's the nation of Israel. The Gentiles
[1:21:25] as individuals, people taken from the
[1:21:28] Gentiles. the Gentiles had to be made up
[1:21:31] of all the people of the world. So now
[1:21:36] and then there's a few comes that into
[1:21:40] that see just like Abra
[1:21:43] uh
[1:21:46] and so now then there's a Jew comes not
[1:21:49] a few there's a Jew comes into that
[1:21:53] just like a Arabian and Irish and Indian
[1:21:57] and what more it's all the people of the
[1:21:59] world make up the bouquet bride but now
[1:22:03] when he comes to dealing with Israel in
[1:22:07] his last part of the 70 weeks. He deals
[1:22:10] with them as a nation. The Gentiles are
[1:22:14] finished. Children, we are there.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; We are there. If God's dealing with you,
[1:22:22] you should be saying, "Thank you,
[1:22:23] Father. Oh, Father, thank you that you
[1:22:27] have quickened me to this word. You've
[1:22:31] quickened me. Don't don't don't just
[1:22:33] allow yourself to be, you know, stirred
[1:22:35] a wee bit, but say allow yourself say,
[1:22:38] "Father, if I'm in that number, quicken
[1:22:41] me
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; by the new birth."
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody here needs to be
[1:22:50] quickened,
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; quickened to it.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Not just more of God, but quickened to
[1:22:58] it.
[1:23:05] He says the Gentiles are finished, the
[1:23:09] hour soon arriving
[1:23:11] and maybe yet this very night. This was
[1:23:14] in the sixth seal.
[1:23:16] That God will completely turn from the
[1:23:20] Gentiles altogether.
[1:23:26] your memories.
[1:23:29] Every I have a lot more memories than
[1:23:31] some of you folks, but
[1:23:34] I always tell younger couples and young
[1:23:36] people, put memories, nice memories in
[1:23:40] your memory bank.
[1:23:42] One day, that's all you'll have left.
[1:23:45] If time goes on, all you have is the
[1:23:47] memories. And you want to be able to
[1:23:49] open up the bank and say, "Give me some
[1:23:53] nice memories."
[1:23:55] Memories are nothing more than
[1:23:59] flipping through the page of your pages
[1:24:01] of your life.
[1:24:03] That's what you're remembering. You're
[1:24:05] smiling, Brother Frank. Brother Frank
[1:24:08] Fletcher has a few memories, too.
[1:24:11] And you're flipping through the pages of
[1:24:13] your life.
[1:24:15] That's what your memories are.
[1:24:18] the book and when the story of your life
[1:24:22] was to change,
[1:24:25] there's parts of your memories that
[1:24:27] perhaps you don't want to think about,
[1:24:30] but God intercepted you.
[1:24:33] God intercepted the writing and the
[1:24:36] script of your book and decided that he
[1:24:39] would interject it,
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; that he would intercept it. And now the
[1:24:44] author now it's not just you it's the
[1:24:46] author in you
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; and he would determine to meet you. So
[1:24:54] that is why send a prophet messenger
[1:24:57] with a special message,
[1:25:05] an invitation
[1:25:08] to meet the author.
[1:25:13] Special invitation
[1:25:16] for you to meet the author.
[1:25:21] Lots of people go to church.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; A lot of people sing songs.
[1:25:27] A lot of people maybe play instruments.
[1:25:29] And a lot of preachers preach.
[1:25:34] But friends, I I'm on the verge of being
[1:25:37] broken because
[1:25:39] I had met him in such a way so suddenly,
[1:25:45] so unannounced.
[1:25:47] I'm studying. I'm just read I'm just
[1:25:49] reading this the way it can happen can
[1:25:51] happen anywhere. Amen.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; I was with a whole group of ministers
[1:25:58] who were talking about everything that
[1:25:59] ministers talk about at a camp meeting.
[1:26:05] And the author just came said, "I want
[1:26:09] to have fellowship." And I realized that
[1:26:12] he wasn't really included in the
[1:26:14] conversation that we were having. And I
[1:26:16] ran from the brothers and got in my car
[1:26:19] and just broke down.
[1:26:23] Brother Nathan, it was in Saskatchewan
[1:26:27] at Lake Wascasu
[1:26:30] at that camp.
[1:26:35] You might be in you might be at your
[1:26:37] work. You might be in school. You might
[1:26:39] be and suddenly
[1:26:42] you'll just sense a presence of
[1:26:44] somebody. It's not like stepping into
[1:26:46] elevator. Have you ever stepped in an
[1:26:47] elevator? Everybody's chatting and
[1:26:49] talking and talking. And then you step
[1:26:51] in the elevator, everybody just stops.
[1:26:53] Usually everybody starts looking at
[1:26:55] their watch because they're they they
[1:26:57] don't know what to do. They're so close
[1:26:59] to people. There's a there's an aura.
[1:27:02] They say there's an aura scientifically
[1:27:04] around people and uh they they say that
[1:27:07] I'm not interested in that, but but
[1:27:10] that's what they say. But you can you
[1:27:12] can sense him and you will know him.
[1:27:16] I'm trying to prepare you for that.
[1:27:25] Everything I've said is just a
[1:27:27] foundation for the next few minutes
[1:27:29] before I close.
[1:27:34] You were predestinated to this hour.
[1:27:39] Please say that's true.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; God knew you were going to be born.
[1:27:45] You were going to come in a natural
[1:27:48] birth,
[1:27:49] a perverted birth. It wasn't the
[1:27:52] original way that God intended. And God
[1:27:56] knew that you'd come in contact and
[1:27:59] somehow the author intercepted your life
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; someplace.
[1:28:04] Maybe at work, maybe in a family, maybe
[1:28:07] with a relative, maybe a stranger, but
[1:28:10] he intercepted your life.
[1:28:14] And he had a struggle. We all have
[1:28:16] struggles. We had a struggle because the
[1:28:19] flesh is still there and the prickly
[1:28:22] nature still there and all those things
[1:28:23] are there. But there's another life
[1:28:25] that's inside. There's another voice.
[1:28:28] It's a tender voice. It's a still small
[1:28:31] voice, but it's a very persistent voice
[1:28:34] and keeps telling you you're mine.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; What happened back there was true. What
[1:28:41] happened back there was real.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; All of these doubts and all of these
[1:28:46] things that tried to take it from you
[1:28:48] has been a lie. You know it's a lie. You
[1:28:52] know it's no happiness. You know there's
[1:28:53] no fulfillment there. And I am the
[1:28:56] truth. I am the alpha and I am the
[1:28:59] omega. I am the beginning and I am the
[1:29:02] end. And I am the one that has called
[1:29:04] you.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:15] And how he shall appear in the last days
[1:29:19] is to bring a people back to the word so
[1:29:22] that the bride will know her husband,
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; know her mate, the revealed word.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; That's why this has to happen.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; That's why this has to happen.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; That's why what's going on right now has
[1:29:36] to happen.
[1:29:38] is to bring the people to her mate to
[1:29:41] their mate. We're the bride of Jesus
[1:29:44] Christ. And just saying that doesn't
[1:29:46] make you bride. You must experience
[1:29:48] that.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; And then
[1:29:58] I just want to refer back to this
[1:30:01] because I'm proceeding now to a very
[1:30:04] very very special place for us.
[1:30:08] And the Lord said to Moses, "Behold,
[1:30:12] there's a place by me, and thou shalt
[1:30:15] stand upon the rock." I want to quickly
[1:30:18] say, says the word was made flesh. You
[1:30:21] know, he came down, came down, and the
[1:30:24] prophet said he was
[1:30:27] actually able.
[1:30:30] Abel expressed Christ
[1:30:32] because he was he was slain. And they
[1:30:35] said, "Now we have the blood that speaks
[1:30:37] better things than that of Abel." He was
[1:30:40] like the fa faithful father in Abraham.
[1:30:43] He was the promised son in Isaac. He was
[1:30:47] he was in in in Jacob and showing his
[1:30:50] his long-suffering mercy. He was in he
[1:30:53] was in uh Joseph as the perfect son. He
[1:30:56] was in all of the prophets and all of
[1:30:58] the kings and Solomon who almost like
[1:31:00] had a a little millennium. And then
[1:31:03] Jesus could say, "A greater than Solomon
[1:31:05] is here." So that in the end time now,
[1:31:08] one that came as your inviter could say,
[1:31:11] "A greater than Solomon is here." And
[1:31:14] prove that it was the same Christ who
[1:31:16] said that back there.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; You're hearing me?
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going through a sequence,
[1:31:26] please, where you'll have to follow it.
[1:31:29] Here's just a little sequence.
[1:31:31] 1961
[1:31:34] in a Revelation series.
[1:31:37] He said, "The seven and last one of
[1:31:40] those seals when they're opened, it's
[1:31:43] found in Revelation the 10th chapter."
[1:31:47] Now, there's the inviter,
[1:31:50] a prophet.
[1:31:52] In Revelation the 10th chapter, there
[1:31:54] was a mighty angel, which was Christ.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Come down.
[1:32:00] I spoke this here in the church and I
[1:32:04] went home. I laid down in my bed and
[1:32:09] right away there was a voice because God
[1:32:13] spoke to me and said, "This is for
[1:32:14] Switzerland
[1:32:16] and I didn't know I was going to
[1:32:18] Switzerland."
[1:32:20] And the voice like said, "Where'd he
[1:32:22] come from?"
[1:32:25] And I got thinking, well, when he came,
[1:32:28] he came from the came from the realms of
[1:32:30] glory. He came down, came into a body of
[1:32:33] humiliation into flesh. He went that
[1:32:36] took that flesh and took flesh of the
[1:32:38] earth. Body like yours and mine. Got
[1:32:41] tired when he was weary. Got thirsty
[1:32:44] when he wanted water. He did all of
[1:32:46] those things exactly like you. And when
[1:32:49] he got to the cross, he felt every bit
[1:32:51] of the pain and the suffering. But he,
[1:32:54] the prophet said he had one promise.
[1:32:57] Your flesh shall not see corruption.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; And he went to death on that one
[1:33:02] promise. He says you have hundreds
[1:33:04] concerning healing. Hundreds concerning
[1:33:07] the rapture. And he had one.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was the author. He
[1:33:12] believed it.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; I trust you believe it with all your
[1:33:15] heart.
[1:33:21] And then just allow me to kind of go
[1:33:24] off.
[1:33:27] Then he went to death. He went to grave.
[1:33:31] And the Bible says he descended and
[1:33:34] preached to the souls that were in
[1:33:35] prison.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says
[1:33:40] he went to hell for us.
[1:33:45] I got thinking about the place and the
[1:33:47] Bible says concerning Judas that he
[1:33:49] betrayed the Lord. And the book of Acts,
[1:33:51] they wanted to they they took Lot to
[1:33:54] find another apostle to fill the place
[1:33:57] of Judas. And they said Judas by
[1:34:00] transgression fell that he might go to
[1:34:03] his own place. And I thought, "Oh, for
[1:34:06] the grace of God,
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ actually went to Judas's
[1:34:10] place.
[1:34:13] He went to the place of the man that
[1:34:16] sold him for 30 pieces of silver.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; People, all kinds of people try to
[1:34:25] discredit this message. I say, "What's
[1:34:27] wrong with the message?" Well, you the
[1:34:29] women have to wear long skirts and and
[1:34:30] and have long hair. What's wrong with
[1:34:33] that?
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Is that so terrible?
[1:34:39] Millions and millions and millions out
[1:34:41] there do it, but they don't have any
[1:34:42] problem with it. But you know the
[1:34:44] believers, you know why it is? It's the
[1:34:46] same spirit coming against that word,
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; that blessed spirit of the author.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; So now he begins to talk about the the
[1:34:58] mighty angel that come down. And I
[1:35:00] thought, where'd he come from?
[1:35:06] And it was sealed up.
[1:35:10] Let me get right down where you are.
[1:35:13] You say, "What? What? What's What's so
[1:35:15] special about the opening of the seals?"
[1:35:17] You didn't know that was Christ.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; You didn't know it was Christ.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; I begin to go into the scripture and I
[1:35:28] can tell you they they have a horse
[1:35:30] rider coming out, a white horse rider,
[1:35:33] and and there's ministers that got on
[1:35:35] the radio and said, "That's the Holy
[1:35:36] Ghost.
[1:35:38] And a prophet of God comes and says it's
[1:35:40] the devil.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; How much further apart can you get than
[1:35:45] that?
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Who are you going to believe?
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; One says it's the Holy Ghost. Prophet of
[1:35:50] God says it's the devil.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; He's got a bow but he has no arrows. I
[1:35:57] say praise God. I take that message.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Got a bow but no arrows. He can't do you
[1:36:06] any damage.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; But who told you it was Christ in
[1:36:10] Revelation 10? Who told you?
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; You didn't know it before?
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; You needed the seal to be open. You
[1:36:19] needed this messenger to come to tell
[1:36:22] you it's him up there.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; He's coming.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Then we can ask why is he coming and
[1:36:30] who's he coming for? And we can find our
[1:36:34] place.
[1:36:36] They will say, "Where are you?" I will
[1:36:38] just find my place. And another mighty
[1:36:41] angel come down from heaven. Oh, this is
[1:36:46] my angel. This is my Lord. He's got a
[1:36:49] covenant over his head. And he's
[1:36:52] writing, as it says also in the Psalms,
[1:36:54] with clouds as dust at his feet. And
[1:36:57] he's riding down. Why? With an
[1:36:59] announcement.
[1:37:01] children is finished. I'm turning back
[1:37:04] to the gender. I'm turning back to the
[1:37:06] Jews. It's all over now. Just get ready
[1:37:10] for the going home.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Did you find your place?
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Our place in the lamb's book of life.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Had to be the lamb. And now he's making
[1:37:28] it known.
[1:37:32] And then in 1962,
[1:37:35] is this the sign of the end, sir?
[1:37:40] That's the title of the message. It's a
[1:37:42] prophet asking that, is this the sign of
[1:37:45] the end? And so he says on part of it,
[1:37:49] now in the 10th chapter of the book of
[1:37:52] Revelation
[1:37:53] of Jesus Christ, I wish to read a few
[1:37:56] verses. And he starts and he reads 1:7
[1:38:00] and he says, "And I saw another mighty
[1:38:02] angel, another mighty angel come down
[1:38:04] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:38:07] rainbow upon his head, and his face was
[1:38:10] as it were the sun, and his feet as
[1:38:14] pillars of fire, and he had in his hand
[1:38:18] a little book open."
[1:38:21] You didn't know what that book was
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; until a messenger came and told you
[1:38:25] about that book.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; You didn't know now that it's a claimed
[1:38:29] book
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; and it's an open book
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; and it's a book that has has the power
[1:38:34] the author of the book has the power to
[1:38:37] forget, has the power to dismiss, has
[1:38:40] the power to deletate permanently. It's
[1:38:43] not the delete button on a computer that
[1:38:46] still keeps it on the hard disk. He
[1:38:48] claims the desk. He abolishes the sin
[1:38:52] and he comes and sends a messenger and
[1:38:54] says, "You tell them they're sinless.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; You tell them they're not only forgiven,
[1:39:01] they're justified."
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; And he comes down with a little book
[1:39:17] open. That's the author of the book.
[1:39:22] The author of the book has a book in his
[1:39:25] hand cuz he's got a special message. And
[1:39:28] now he's not just coming to redeem a
[1:39:30] bunch of people. And he's not just
[1:39:32] coming to be beaten and to and to be
[1:39:35] have his beard pulled out and spat upon.
[1:39:37] That's not what he's coming for now.
[1:39:39] He's coming to be loved. Now he's coming
[1:39:42] in a marriage ceremony. Now he's coming
[1:39:45] with a marriage certificate in his hand.
[1:39:48] Hallelujah. Now he's coming with a ring
[1:39:51] of grace to slip it on her finger.
[1:39:53] Hallelujah. So you can look at it and
[1:39:55] say, "Grace, grace. Amazing grace."
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you folks enjoy it, but
[1:40:06] I'm enjoying it.
[1:40:14] It's not a Ruth.
[1:40:17] It's not a Ruth of the Old Testament.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; It's not an Esther. Now,
[1:40:22] it's not a Mary. It's not a Sarah.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; It's none of these types. I'm not coming
[1:40:28] for a type. I'm coming for the person.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Listen friends, your place
[1:40:43] if you're going to be I wrote this down
[1:40:46] when I was in such a state.
[1:40:50] If you're going to be
[1:40:53] what you ought to be, what you need to
[1:40:55] be, you need to find your place in the
[1:40:59] book to really find your place in this
[1:41:02] world.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. That's true.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; To know what kind of a man, what kind of
[1:41:09] a woman, what kind of a young person,
[1:41:11] what kind of a person am I to be
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; to represent him?
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; You've got to see your place in the
[1:41:20] book.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus could say,
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; "It is written," and quote Isaiah,
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; and then say, "This day is this
[1:41:31] scripture fulfilled." I can say this
[1:41:35] day, this scripture, I saw another
[1:41:38] mighty angel. I have felt his divine
[1:41:41] presence. He has saved my soul and
[1:41:45] healed my body. I can say he's the
[1:41:48] author of truth.
[1:41:50] He's the author of life.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Is he your author?
[1:42:00] That's why when he come from the bosom
[1:42:02] of the father, he knew what was in the
[1:42:04] father's mind. He knew who had been
[1:42:08] chosen. He knew who was here to be play
[1:42:11] out part of the book.
[1:42:16] And then he whispered
[1:42:19] to his bride.
[1:42:22] I hope you can but can you stay with me
[1:42:25] a few more minutes?
[1:42:28] See when he was here on earth he came
[1:42:32] priest came and handed the book to him.
[1:42:34] You know that happened in brother
[1:42:35] Brandham's case birth pains couldn't
[1:42:37] find a place in the Bible and a a priest
[1:42:41] came and handed the book. Do you know
[1:42:44] that a man who sat in our church for a
[1:42:46] few years was the song leader where that
[1:42:49] priest would came to speak in Tri
[1:42:52] Cities, Washington.
[1:42:57] That man, that man, the song leader
[1:43:00] became a a a believer of the message.
[1:43:05] I prayed for him one day at the altar.
[1:43:08] Forgive me for including myself, but
[1:43:12] and he asked him about that event when
[1:43:15] you handed the book to William Brham.
[1:43:19] He said,
[1:43:21] "Did you know that was Elijah?" He said,
[1:43:24] "If he would have said clearly that I'm
[1:43:27] Elijah," he said, "I would have dropped
[1:43:29] my val, my case, and followed him.
[1:43:39] Friends,
[1:43:41] if God reveals it to you,
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; it's stronger than any human saying it.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Once it's revealed to you, you cannot,
[1:43:55] nobody can argue why you out of it.
[1:44:07] They begin to the prophet said he begin
[1:44:09] to whisper
[1:44:12] when he came on the I'm I'm trying to go
[1:44:14] quickly but when he came and he found
[1:44:16] his place that's why it so struck out to
[1:44:19] me he had opened the book he read the
[1:44:21] scripture identified himself and he
[1:44:23] Bible says he closed the book
[1:44:27] you don't want that to happen to us.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; We say make yourself known.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Keep the book open to us.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Reveal yourself. Keep whispering. Lord
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; whisper.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; When you whisper something, it's not for
[1:44:46] everybody.
[1:44:49] When you whisper something, it's not
[1:44:51] even for someone who's close by.
[1:44:54] You're whispering it to them.
[1:44:57] and he's whispering to us friends
[1:45:01] says and I we said well I've heard that
[1:45:04] a long time ago I know that uh that uh
[1:45:07] uh he was you know how did you know it
[1:45:10] I'm simply pointing out your place in
[1:45:12] the book and then uh and uh then seven
[1:45:18] thunders uttered their voices and the
[1:45:20] angel which I saw standing upon the sea
[1:45:23] and upon the earth lifted up his voice
[1:45:25] lifted up his hands to heaven. And he
[1:45:28] swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:45:30] ever. Created heavens and the earth, and
[1:45:32] the things that in them are, and the
[1:45:35] earth, and the things that therein are,
[1:45:38] and the sea, and the things which uh
[1:45:41] therein are, that time should be no
[1:45:44] longer. And the and the dagot, says the
[1:45:47] Greek digot says that the time shall no
[1:45:50] longer be delayed. In other words, now
[1:45:53] I'm coming down. I make it known.
[1:45:56] It won't be delayed any longer. Now it's
[1:45:59] set in motion. And friends of Cloverdale
[1:46:03] Bible Way and whoever may be hearing or
[1:46:06] ever hear this voice,
[1:46:10] we are in the cycle.
[1:46:14] And when he revealed who that was that
[1:46:17] was descending and had a prophet
[1:46:20] messenger on the earth that would start
[1:46:22] at a certain season in his ministry and
[1:46:25] start identifying who that was. I can
[1:46:28] tell you if it wasn't before it
[1:46:30] certainly was at that moment that the
[1:46:32] cycle started
[1:46:34] and he be now he had revealed himself
[1:46:37] before as he revealed himself that
[1:46:39] prophet messenger as a prophet and a
[1:46:41] servant of God and uh know the secrets
[1:46:44] of the heart and then he finally comes
[1:46:46] up and that was me and he was trying to
[1:46:50] say all the time that's not me that's my
[1:46:52] voice but that's not me speaking we
[1:46:55] begin to hear now it comes from another
[1:46:57] place it comes come from another source.
[1:47:01] And then he begins to identify a people.
[1:47:03] And you if you if you actually study,
[1:47:05] you'll find out it was well into the
[1:47:07] message that he begins to really
[1:47:09] identify the bride and who the bride is
[1:47:12] and what he's doing for the bride.
[1:47:15] Help help me now to to close.
[1:47:27] And I I I do want to say this
[1:47:32] in the message. Is this the sign of the
[1:47:34] end? Sir,
[1:47:36] is this the sign of the end? said,
[1:47:39] "These stars falling into their
[1:47:41] constellation back yonder the angel
[1:47:43] coming and said as John was sent to wind
[1:47:46] up the Old Testament and bring forth the
[1:47:48] introduction to bring forth the
[1:47:50] introduction
[1:47:52] uh of Christ a message all wind up the
[1:47:56] loose ends and will introduce the
[1:47:59] Messiah just before his coming. We all
[1:48:04] of us here I suppose all of us have come
[1:48:07] after the introduction
[1:48:10] he introduced himself. How did he
[1:48:12] introduce himself? He did exactly the
[1:48:14] same thing.
[1:48:16] He did the same thing. You know I've
[1:48:18] read with my own eyes men who have
[1:48:20] reported on what happened and you know
[1:48:22] what they said Bible days are here
[1:48:25] again.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; What is the Bible? It's of Christ.
[1:48:28] That's what they were saying. Did they
[1:48:30] walk this direction? Did they take this
[1:48:32] message? No. Cuz it kind of ran a foul
[1:48:35] with what they had been taught before.
[1:48:38] If they could have only realized this
[1:48:39] was a this was the author of the book
[1:48:41] speaking. Now
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; he says now and this angel came down
[1:48:51] from heaven. The other seven angels of
[1:48:54] the seven churches was earthly
[1:48:57] messengers. But this angel, all the
[1:49:00] message is finished. And the seventh
[1:49:02] angel winds up the whole thing. And this
[1:49:05] angel comes not to the earth, not to the
[1:49:08] earth. He isn't a man from the earth as
[1:49:11] the messengers of the church ages.
[1:49:14] That's finished. But this angel brings
[1:49:17] the next announcement. And an angel
[1:49:19] means a messenger. And he comes down
[1:49:21] from heaven clothed with a pillar of
[1:49:24] light, a cloud with a rainbow over his
[1:49:28] head. And a rainbow is a covenant. It
[1:49:30] was Christ. Oh, it was the one I tell
[1:49:33] you. It was the one I tried to tell you
[1:49:36] about.
[1:49:38] And this didn't come to the earth. It
[1:49:40] came down. It came down from heaven
[1:49:43] because he came down from heaven
[1:49:46] because, are you with me? Because
[1:49:52] the mystery
[1:49:54] is all finished.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; You say, "What mystery?" I've heard this
[1:50:01] so many times. I tell you before this
[1:50:05] message, it was a mystery.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; And you can hear whatever scholar you
[1:50:10] want to hear. They go all over the map
[1:50:13] and they contradict one another and they
[1:50:15] all declare it to be the truth. How can
[1:50:17] it be the truth when it contradicts the
[1:50:19] other one?
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Some of you young people probably won't
[1:50:23] remember, but some years ago when we
[1:50:25] were still in the log church, I decided
[1:50:27] one Saturday while I was studying that I
[1:50:28] would call up some ministers. I called
[1:50:31] up eight eight ministers on on a
[1:50:35] Saturday morning. And I said, "Excuse
[1:50:37] me, I know that you'll be getting ready.
[1:50:39] I'm interested in the scripture." And I
[1:50:41] said, "Revelation 17 now talks about the
[1:50:44] great harlot and so on." I said, "Could
[1:50:46] could you tell me what you
[1:50:49] what do you believe about that?" And
[1:50:51] they were they were all over the map.
[1:50:54] And and one of them, they'll never
[1:50:55] forget. He says, "Oh," he says, "You
[1:50:58] want to stay away from that?" He says,
[1:50:59] "That's dangerous."
[1:51:02] I thought, "Now, what what are his
[1:51:04] people going to hear?" And it talks
[1:51:06] about the great harlot, the enemy of the
[1:51:08] church of God. It talk about the great
[1:51:11] enemy. They have no idea of it. Oh,
[1:51:13] don't don't want to talk about that.
[1:51:15] Stay away from that. That's dangerous.
[1:51:18] And I said, I got a congregation of
[1:51:20] people listening to that in the morning.
[1:51:39] I said, "What is it, friends?" He said,
[1:51:43] I'm asking you, where are we at, sir?
[1:51:48] I'd like to ask this congregation, where
[1:51:50] are we at?
[1:51:51] That's why I don't want to be too
[1:51:54] demonstrative. I want you to think real
[1:51:56] deep. It was very quiet when brother
[1:51:58] Brandham said that. He said, "Where are
[1:52:00] we at?"
[1:52:05] And I thought I thought very very deep
[1:52:08] for the last two weeks. Where where are
[1:52:11] we at? Where am I? Where am I? And my
[1:52:15] wife and I talked over the table. Jesus
[1:52:18] came to the scripture. Where am I in the
[1:52:19] scripture? And I I don't have a whole
[1:52:22] lot of places, but I can come to
[1:52:24] Revelation 10:1.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Say, beloved,
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; my beloved,
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; that's you.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:34] And beloved
[1:52:37] Jesus, I did not know that was you till
[1:52:40] you sent this servant.
[1:52:43] I didn't know it was you. And then he
[1:52:46] told about it and I and I am I'm able to
[1:52:48] go to the computer and I'm able to find
[1:52:50] out. He spoke of it here. Then he spoke
[1:52:52] of it there. And he went on down and he
[1:52:55] began to tell me what it was all about.
[1:52:58] I tell you what, friends, that's what we
[1:53:00] need to hear. Amen.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; That's what we need to hear.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; And and I I want to I want you to be
[1:53:07] able to leave here today saying, "Well,
[1:53:10] brother Biscll, if I don't go away with
[1:53:12] anything else, I go away with one thing.
[1:53:15] I can find my place
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; in the book."
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; Not only in the book, I can find my
[1:53:21] place in the Lamb's book of life.
[1:53:24] And in that lamb's book of life, there
[1:53:26] is not a twinge of sin or iniquity or
[1:53:29] anything there. We can say, "He has
[1:53:32] forgiven me."
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Linda, I wonder if if Linda's here.
[1:53:45] I was so inspired.
[1:53:49] would you mind if I just feel a little
[1:53:51] bit of liberty for a moment?
[1:53:54] I've never had this happen. And I began
[1:53:57] to sing song. I can't sing, but I began
[1:54:00] to sing a song. And I I reached over and
[1:54:03] grabbed a piece of paper and I wrote
[1:54:04] that song down. And then as I was in my
[1:54:08] broken state and and I I was just lost.
[1:54:11] And then another song come, I reached
[1:54:13] over and I started writing that song.
[1:54:18] And some of these are
[1:54:35] How many have ever heard or know
[1:54:38] that song? It's not a chorus, not a
[1:54:40] popular chorus. It's a course of a song.
[1:54:42] Now I am saved. Just just sing the just
[1:54:46] come to Can you put some power on it?
[1:54:48] The
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; What is the words of the uh
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; words of the verse?
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; In the darkness. I wondered,
[1:55:10] vanished from God,
[1:55:12] knowing not of his grace,
[1:55:18] seeking by merit
[1:55:21] to gain my salvation,
[1:55:26] ever despairing
[1:55:29] of winning the race.
[1:55:34] Now, now I am saved.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; I can shout hallelujah.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Glory
[1:55:44] from my sins and my darkness
[1:55:48] made bright.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; No more darkness
[1:55:54] and fear shall I wonder.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[1:56:02] has
[1:56:04] My gloom and my night. Now I am safe.
[1:56:10] Now I am saved.
[1:56:14] I can shout
[1:56:16] hallelujah.
[1:56:21] From my sins and my path
[1:56:25] made bright.
[1:56:28] No more in darkness
[1:56:32] and fear.
[1:56:35] No more in darkness norus.
[1:56:47] Now I am saved.
[1:56:51] I can shout hallelujah.
[1:56:57] made from my sins and my pathway made.
[1:57:05] No more in darkness
[1:57:09] and fear shall I wonder.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Jesus has
[1:57:19] my loom and my night. Why don't you
[1:57:24] stand? S Linda, sing the second verse
[1:57:27] and we'll join in.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Fearing God's judgement.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Yet seeking his favor
[1:57:37] to him. My works and self effort I gave.
[1:57:46] Then I at last saw the plan of
[1:57:50] salvation.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. In the blessed savior
[1:57:56] so mighty
[1:57:58] to sing.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Now I am saved.
[1:58:05] I can shout. Hallelujah.
[1:58:11] Save from my sins and I have way.
[1:58:19] Oh, no more in darkness
[1:58:23] and fear shall I wonder.
[1:58:29] Jesus has
[1:58:33] my bloom and my
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; listen to the words of this next verse.
[1:58:39] This is the third verse. Oh, how I
[1:58:42] grasped at God's offer of mercy
[1:58:48] when by his grace he revealed it to me.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; Showing me Christ
[1:59:00] who had purchased my pardon
[1:59:05] went for my sins. He was judged on the
[1:59:10] tree.
[1:59:13] Now I am saved.
[1:59:17] I can shout
[1:59:19] halleluah.
[1:59:23] Straight from my sins and my path made
[1:59:29] right.
[1:59:32] No more in darkness
[1:59:36] and fear shall I wonder.
[1:59:41] Jesus
[1:59:43] has scattered
[1:59:46] my
[1:59:51] sing justified. Justified
[1:59:55] friends before we close before we sing.
[1:59:58] It's one of the services I don't hardly
[2:00:00] feel like closing, but we're going to
[2:00:01] have baptism tonight.
[2:00:04] We're going to have the Lord's table
[2:00:05] tonight. So, look forward to it.
[2:00:13] I want to announce to you,
[2:00:16] announce to you,
[2:00:20] we've found our place in the Lord.
[2:00:25] I want to declare to you friends, if you
[2:00:28] don't show it to anybody else, show it
[2:00:30] to the devil.
[2:00:32] Let Satan know that's me.
[2:00:36] And the author wrote of me.
[2:00:41] And he put one foot on the sea and one
[2:00:43] foot on the earth and declared and swore
[2:00:47] by himself. Hallelujah. Who's God?
[2:00:50] That's my God.
[2:00:56] Hallelujah.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; Is it all right friends?
[2:01:04] You might have kept you a little bit
[2:01:05] extra time. I I want to sing this also
[2:01:09] together.
[2:01:12] Justified the court.
[2:01:16] You're justified.
[2:01:20] Justified.
[2:01:39] have done it in the first place.
[2:01:46] Justified.
[2:01:49] Justified
[2:01:53] as
[2:01:57] justified.
[2:01:58] Justified.
[2:02:00] Justified.
[2:02:04] Justified.
[2:02:07] He had not done in the first place.
[2:02:11] Goodbye.
[2:02:15] Look at the picture.
[2:02:22] Didn't look at you where you are now.
[2:02:32] You might have passed shortly off.
[2:02:36] You have not done it in the first place.
[2:02:40] Justified.
[2:02:41] Justified.
[2:02:43] Justified.
[2:02:47] Justified.
[2:02:50] And I died in the first place. Justine.
[2:02:57] I'm justified.
[2:03:01] Justified
[2:03:08] just
[2:03:13] where do you find out you bypass your
[2:03:14] theophony?
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Where do you find that? Where do you
[2:03:21] hear that? Where'd that come from?
[2:03:24] Hallelujah.
[2:03:26] I'm glad he descended.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Now it answers all the questions. What
[2:03:33] happened? Oh, you just bypassed your
[2:03:35] theophony. It's okay. You're going to
[2:03:37] get it.
[2:03:39] It's just a step away. You're just going
[2:03:41] to step into it. Hallelujah. Who told us
[2:03:44] about that? Thank God.
[2:03:54] Brother John, why don't you come and
[2:03:55] close in prayer?
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's good news, isn't
[2:04:02] it?
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Why don't we thank the Lord together?
[2:04:05] Our heavenly father, we want to thank
[2:04:07] you, Lord. We've been brought from all
[2:04:10] so many walks of life and places, but we
[2:04:13] found our place in the same book. Lord,
[2:04:16] we look down the aisle and across the
[2:04:18] pew and across the room and we see
[2:04:20] nothing but God, nothing but Christ,
[2:04:23] nothing but miracles, saved by grace, no
[2:04:26] longer sinners, but we're sons and
[2:04:29] daughters. Lord, that ought to lift up
[2:04:31] every heart. That ought to rejoice every
[2:04:33] soul today that we saw our name in a
[2:04:36] book that cannot be erased. Satan tried
[2:04:39] to delete us some before we were even
[2:04:41] born and in the womb. But Lord, we came
[2:04:43] and was manifested not just in the
[2:04:46] natural, but in the spiritual. And you
[2:04:48] have followed us all the way down
[2:04:50] through our lives. And one day we were
[2:04:52] born again. And here we are, Lord. And
[2:04:55] we're not ashamed to declare that you
[2:04:57] are our God. And this message came for
[2:05:00] us. And we thank you and we rejoice
[2:05:03] today, Lord. Our hearts are beating,
[2:05:05] Lord. that this is the greatest thing in
[2:05:07] all of our lives is that Jesus is making
[2:05:10] himself known in our flesh. Lord, what a
[2:05:14] service before the communion table. What
[2:05:17] a time tonight, Lord. We can rejoice
[2:05:19] that it's no longer us that's living,
[2:05:21] but it's Christ that has been born
[2:05:24] again, Lord. Oh, Father, let's this
[2:05:26] afternoon and tonight be a great
[2:05:29] rejoicing time for the saints. Let this
[2:05:31] assembly experience great healing, great
[2:05:34] deliverance, great revelation. Lord, as
[2:05:37] we see this day, this February first,
[2:05:42] this scripture is being fulfilled.
[2:05:46] That is super, that is supernatural.
[2:05:49] Our eyes have come open, Lord. And we
[2:05:52] have won the battle. It's already done.
[2:05:55] And we're on the winning side. And we've
[2:05:58] seen, Lord, we've heard from our
[2:06:00] theophony. And we've seen our names in
[2:06:02] the book. There's no reason for any
[2:06:04] defeat. There's no reason for any more
[2:06:07] unbelief. But Lord, may our eyes come
[2:06:09] open and may we rejoice. The Holy Ghost
[2:06:12] is quickening sons and daughters. Oh,
[2:06:15] Father, we pray this afternoon and as we
[2:06:17] come tonight, Lord, all three
[2:06:19] ordinances, Lord, in one evening,
[2:06:21] baptism, communion, and foot washing,
[2:06:24] and rejoicing. Lord, when you came to
[2:06:27] your cross, Lord, great heaviness was
[2:06:29] upon your shoulders. And there were men
[2:06:31] and women that could not watch and tar
[2:06:34] with you not even an hour. They were
[2:06:36] under such a burden. But Lord, at the
[2:06:39] end of the ages, there's another group
[2:06:41] of people that are watching and
[2:06:43] prayerful and are looking unto you,
[2:06:46] Lord, and coming to our cross as it was,
[2:06:49] but our eyes are wide open, Lord. this
[2:06:51] day, this scriptur is being fulfilled,
[2:06:54] that our hearts can be free to know that
[2:06:56] the rapture has already began. Lord, we
[2:06:59] thank you and rejoice. Bless our pastor,
[2:07:02] our senior pastor that has given his
[2:07:04] life, Lord, and you've allowed him a
[2:07:06] glimpse over the wall for us younger
[2:07:08] ones and us coming behind to be able to
[2:07:11] say, "Thank the Lord Jesus that our
[2:07:13] eagle eyes have got that were once
[2:07:15] filmed over. Now we can see clearly the
[2:07:18] vision of the word and it is plain and
[2:07:20] we can run with this message all the way
[2:07:23] to the end. strengthen Lord every life
[2:07:26] that's here, visitors and then those
[2:07:28] that'll be coming tonight special in
[2:07:30] give us a great time around the table
[2:07:32] and as we wash feet with one another let
[2:07:35] us recognize it is Jesus that is here
[2:07:37] among us again we thank you and we go
[2:07:40] rejoicing in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:07:43] amen
[2:07:47] thank you God bless you
[2:07:50] why don't you turn around shake hands
[2:07:52] with some that you're going to spend
[2:07:54] eternity with. And then you're dismissed
[2:07:57] in Jesus name. Meeting starts at 4:30.
[2:08:00] 4:30.
[2:08:02] Thank you. God bless you. You're
[2:08:03] dismissed in Jesus name. Amen.
