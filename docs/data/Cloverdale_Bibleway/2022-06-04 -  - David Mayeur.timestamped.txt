[0:41] for you each one and for those men that
[0:45] are here on the platform that have left
[0:47] their churches yes
[0:49] brother
[0:50] david meyer
[0:52] and son
[0:54] have come from switzerland
[0:58] brother
[0:59] tim pruitt
[1:02] and brother tim pruitt has said
[1:06] he said again at our table
[1:09] and i believe it with all my heart
[1:12] he said brother ron spencer
[1:15] is a miracle amen when he stands and
[1:18] preaches
[1:20] every week and i know something about
[1:22] that
[1:26] and he's the man who prayed a prayer
[1:30] when i was laying in the hospital
[1:33] and i suddenly
[1:36] i jerked my head
[1:39] because i knew my family was waiting
[1:43] and
[1:44] i said
[1:46] i don't know and i said out loud i don't
[1:49] know if i'm going to come out of there
[1:53] i had had
[1:56] brother ron spencer pray
[1:59] and i said
[2:01] i'll just call his cell
[2:03] you don't mind standing do you
[2:06] a few moments
[2:08] i'll call his cell
[2:10] and if he answers
[2:12] then i know that god is
[2:15] has put it together
[2:17] and i
[2:19] call his cell
[2:21] and i said brother ron
[2:23] i called you once
[2:25] for prayer
[2:27] now i'm calling you again
[2:29] for prayer
[2:31] the first time
[2:34] it was just a
[2:37] physical thing
[2:38] but this time it's a spiritual thing
[2:42] and i don't know whether i'm going to
[2:43] come out of this place
[2:47] and
[2:48] he said sure brotherhood
[2:51] and he prayed a prayer and he started to
[2:54] pray
[2:55] and i thought
[2:57] while he was praying i thought i'm going
[2:59] to
[2:59] hang on to the words
[3:02] because this is my turn
[3:05] the woman at the well
[3:07] it was her turn
[3:08] but now this is my turn
[3:11] and i brought it up to today
[3:15] and friends i moved
[3:18] i moved because
[3:20] god answered the prayer
[3:22] and i said
[3:25] i i prayed and i said
[3:28] would you have pray
[3:31] for me i have 14 blockages
[3:35] 90
[3:37] in the main artery
[3:40] i have not told all of this
[3:45] and
[3:46] down to 30 in other
[3:49] and my cardiologist had a look at it and
[3:52] they said to my wife
[3:56] he said
[3:57] the
[3:58] man that did the
[4:02] bypass
[4:04] and he didn't turn on any of the bypass
[4:07] equipment
[4:08] he said
[4:10] this is off pump
[4:13] and that's what they said on the
[4:15] document
[4:17] it was an off-pump
[4:19] operation
[4:21] and they operated on my heart for three
[4:23] and a half hours
[4:26] and the
[4:27] chung was his name
[4:30] and i thought it was dr watson going to
[4:33] be doing the operation
[4:36] so
[4:37] i i just
[4:39] when brother
[4:40] ron spencer was praying
[4:43] he said anoint the person anoint
[4:47] he didn't even say the person or the man
[4:50] or the woman
[4:51] or the doctor he said anoint them
[4:54] anoint them
[4:56] so that they will
[4:59] rise to the challenge
[5:02] and i thought well i know who the person
[5:05] is is dr watson
[5:07] and i went back into dr watson's office
[5:11] or no i'm sorry i didn't go back into
[5:14] his office i was laying on the bed
[5:17] and he said unfortunately we have to
[5:20] leave i have to leave tonight and i will
[5:23] not be there to do your surgery
[5:26] i said
[5:28] who's going to do it he said dr chung
[5:31] he will be in charge of the
[5:33] i said
[5:35] dr watson
[5:37] you look awfully
[5:39] awful lot
[5:41] like a man that stood at the foot of my
[5:44] bed who was dr watson
[5:46] he said i am dr watson
[5:50] but i can't do your operation
[5:53] and he said we have great teams
[5:56] i said
[5:59] would you
[5:59] [Music]
[6:01] be standing there
[6:04] as i am laying here
[6:07] would you
[6:08] be as happy
[6:10] if
[6:11] dr chung was doing
[6:14] your surgery and the head of the team
[6:18] he said that was the only time he smiled
[6:22] he cracked a little smile
[6:24] and he said all of our people our teams
[6:27] are good
[6:28] and i said would you trust him with your
[6:31] life
[6:33] and he said yeah i think so i would
[6:36] i said that's good
[6:41] because he's the same yesterday
[6:44] today
[6:45] and forever
[6:47] and there was a sister here

[7:30] and
[7:31] andy and i know that it's right
[7:35] it's right that shirley should be up
[7:37] there
[7:41] and i know it was right
[7:43] and dr chung
[7:45] he was ready to do the surgery for me
[7:49] and he
[7:52] i want to
[7:53] say this
[7:55] my daughters were there
[7:58] and they tapped real quick and my for my
[8:02] wife's sake
[8:03] and brought up the google
[8:06] search
[8:07] and brought up
[8:08] dr
[8:09] chung's name
[8:11] and he got famous
[8:13] by transplanting
[8:15] three
[8:16] human hearts
[8:17] in one evening
[8:21] and that was a
[8:22] fifteen he stood on his feet for 15
[8:25] hours and transplanted those three
[8:28] hearts
[8:28] and nana
[8:30] i felt okay
[8:35] i felt okay
[8:37] and in the morning he said hi i'm dr
[8:40] chung
[8:41] i said nice to see you he said this is
[8:44] dr kang
[8:46] from singapore
[8:47] he's going to be assisting me
[8:50] and
[8:51] watching while i do the surgery i said
[8:54] well great i prayed for you
[8:56] all both of you and by name dr chung i
[9:00] prayed for you
[9:02] dr kang i prayed for you
[9:05] and they said well thank you they
[9:08] accepted that
[9:10] but i i wanted to get that
[9:13] in and i had prayed for them
[9:16] and a man who was a cardiologist was not
[9:19] even there
[9:21] but he was looking at the pictures and
[9:23] he said
[9:24] well he said we have
[9:28] 14 blockages
[9:30] and we've bypassed those
[9:34] and the dr chung was able to bypass them
[9:39] with about
[9:40] three
[9:42] only three bypasses
[9:46] it was just miraculous
[9:49] and uh
[9:51] so i was standing there and he said
[9:55] he said you have this bypass
[9:58] and that bypass
[10:00] and you have a uh
[10:02] an extra one
[10:04] he says and my wife said to him why do
[10:08] we have that he said
[10:10] it's because he's a man of god
[10:14] and he's jewish
[10:16] he was jewish cardiologist
[10:19] but he said well he's a man of god
[10:22] and so
[10:24] they operated on it
[10:26] and he
[10:28] he wouldn't let michael in the room
[10:32] michael wanted so badly to go in
[10:40] michael is our in-house doctor
[10:44] but he this was above him
[10:47] apparently
[10:50] anyhow michael that was the other part
[10:54] of the story
[10:55] and that's why they wouldn't let
[10:58] because i had said to my wife
[11:00] nobody goes in and sees
[11:02] until the tube is out of
[11:05] i don't i don't want them to see in tube
[11:08] and that was because
[11:11] my grand
[11:13] my
[11:15] son-in-law
[11:18] who's married to
[11:19] linda ordeal
[11:23] and kenneth ordeal was there
[11:26] and i said i do not want them to see
[11:28] them moving that two boat two weeks
[11:31] before
[11:33] he had saw he had
[11:35] had to give the word for his
[11:38] mother
[11:40] to have the tube taken out and she
[11:43] didn't last
[11:44] and they had a
[11:46] funeral for her
[11:48] and i said i don't want that right i i
[11:51] don't want that to happen
[11:54] i want to him to know that it's all done
[11:59] and it's finished
[12:00] and the man who was doing it he said
[12:03] can you hear me yes i said i can hear
[12:06] you
[12:07] he said the last little thing i'm going
[12:09] to do is take the tube out
[12:12] and i took it out i wasn't in tube
[12:14] anymore
[12:16] and i was perfectly fine
