[0:45] well it's in Maryland now isn't that
[0:48] something and then here is the picture
[0:50] of those uh I was telling you this
[0:53] morning of those
[0:55] Beatles The Return of Beatles And
[0:58] there's the articles you just should
[1:00] read it out of the magazine and all of
[1:04] the different thing as it were had
[1:06] founded a new religion now they're a
[1:10] manager I've got a note out of the paper
[1:12] here you haven't got time if anybody
[1:13] wants to read these I put them on the
[1:14] bulletin board and you can read them I
[1:17] just want to show you the hour that
[1:18] we're living in shocking you might not
[1:21] understand it but people try to
[1:23] understand it that what these things are
[1:26] I've asked brother capsy got a good
[1:28] education and can read better than I
[1:31] I've asked him to read this article from
[1:33] the manager of the Beatles you do it
[1:36] brother the
[1:38] Caps states that the Beatles wonder
[1:41] about themselves and draw no answers
[1:43] it's incredible absolutely incredible
[1:46] says Derek Taylor The Beatles press
[1:49] officer here are these four boys from
[1:51] Liverpool they're rude they're profane
[1:55] they're vulgar and they've taken over
[1:57] the world it's as if they'd founded a
[1:59] new religion they're completely
[2:02] Antichrist I mean I'm Antichrist as well
[2:05] but they're so Antichrist they shock me
[2:08] which isn't an easy thing but I'm
[2:11] obsessed with
[2:12] them isn't everybody I'm obsessed with
[2:15] their honesty and the people who La them
[2:17] most are the people who should be
[2:19] outraged most in Australia for example
[2:22] each time we'd arrive at an airport it
[2:25] was as if deal had landed or better yet
[2:28] the Messiah The Roots were lined solid
[2:32] cripples threw away their sticks sick
[2:35] people rushed up to the car as if a
[2:37] touch from one of the boys would make
[2:39] them well again old women stood watching
[2:42] with her grandchildren as we'd passed by
[2:45] I could see the look on their faces it
[2:48] was as if some savior had arrived and
[2:51] all these people were happy and relieved
[2:53] as if things somehow were going to be
[2:56] better now Taylor paused and stuck a
[2:58] cigarette in his mouth
[3:00] the only thing left for the Beatles he
[3:02] said is to go on a healing
[3:06] tour isn't that what he
[3:09] said many shall come to me in that day
[3:11] and say Lord have not I se now can't you
[3:16] see that you can't P your trust in
[3:18] heating campaigns you can't put your
[3:20] trust in any kind of a sign like that
[3:23] the only thing you can put your trust in
[3:25] is thus sayeth the Lord from the Bible I
[3:28] church that is a exactly where I have
[3:31] tried to keep you my children and if
[3:34] something happens to me and God takes me
[3:36] out of this Earth don't you never fail
[3:39] remember this with all your heart stay
[3:42] with that word don't you leave that word
[3:46] anything contrary to it leave it alone
[3:49] no matter what it is then you know it's
[3:52] right a healing campaign now sinful man
[3:57] that even shocked their own man
[4:00] with their Bulger and dirt and filth and
[4:03] people throw away their crutches and get
[4:05] healed by looking at these boys it's so
[4:08] filthy and dirty and
[4:11] Antichrist you see it's Satan on a mock
[4:16] campaign see he does anything that the
[4:18] Christ can do but he can't confirm the
[4:22] word he'll take part of it year and part
[4:24] of it year but he can't take it all
[4:26] together see he can't get it together so
[4:29] you see no wonder the Bible said that
[4:31] would almost fool the very elected if it
[4:33] was possible the Antichrist Spirit now
[4:37] even their own press manager here press
[4:40] agent he's for him believes in him and
[4:43] said he's possessed of the same thing
[4:44] because they've wanton him over them
[4:47] evil things and now don't you see women
[4:50] why I am trying to tell you about this
[4:52] short wearing hair cutting bobbing and
[4:54] things it's a
[4:58] spirit it is a spirit here it is right
[5:01] in our leading magazines and everything
[5:03] of what showing not rock and rolling
[5:05] stuff in the church why it's a setup
[5:07] exactly for Satan and there's still
[5:09] churches and
[5:11] denominations back to the word children
[5:14] is fast as you can go don't you dare to
[5:16] leave it you stay right with that word
[5:19] see how that Antichrist Spirit it can
[5:22] speak in tongues you can show signs and
[5:24] wonders you can heal the sick you can do
[5:27] all these things see them people
[5:29] thinking they're approaching God at the
[5:31] boys where God sent because the church
[5:33] has let down on the
[5:36] [Music]
[5:37] word those boys belong to
[5:40] church Elvis Presley is a Pentecostal
[5:44] Pat Boon is a Church of
[5:46] Christ look at them guys Pentecostals
[5:49] Church of Christ and all those like that
[5:51] with them evil spirits on them read
[5:54] fully a golden voice Church of Christ
[5:59] sing the religious songs like nobody can
[6:01] sing them and rock and roll in the next
[6:03] Voice by their fruits you know them look
[6:07] what churches they belong
[6:11] to Elvis Presley and members of the
[6:13] Assemblies of
[6:15] God there you are each one of them
[6:17] wanted that and Satan give it to them
[6:20] don't you see friends how don't let
[6:22] loose of that word see it's a spirit
[6:25] that gets on you now I tell these women
[6:28] when they make themselves look sexy in
[6:30] these dresses that God's going to make
[6:31] you answer for committing
[6:34] adultery if you believe me to be what
[6:37] you say God's servant a prophet listen
[6:40] to what I'm telling you see you might
[6:42] not be able to understand it if you
[6:44] can't then you just do what I tell you
[6:45] to do God will hold me responsible for
[6:47] what I say see you listen real close and
[6:52] remember that those things are Spirit
[6:54] ordinarily maybe the person don't you
[6:57] remember God
[6:59] with skin I preached so not long ago see
[7:03] see God it with skin on
[7:06] it now just remember some of us are sent
[7:09] to this world to break into these rims
[7:11] to tell us these things see it's the for
[7:14] knowledge it's God speaking showing when
[7:17] you judge anything by the flesh why
[7:19] they're innocent look here fine people
[7:21] honest wouldn't tell yall l or nothing
[7:25] and the whole thing is a
[7:28] devil religious even starting a healing
[7:32] campaign see of just exactly
[7:37] Antichrist as Presbyterian and all that
[7:39] you see them denominations how they do
[7:41] right the same thing well here in London
[7:42] England just recently they had a rock
[7:44] and roll team to impersonate Christ and
[7:47] Judas and all that and uh they called
[7:50] Christ Daddyo and talked all those c
[7:52] words them crazy kids talk see the
[7:55] teenage kids tuck over the world
[7:59] now you know that the Bible predicts
[8:01] that unthankful Unholy without natural
[8:04] affections truth Breakers false accusers
[8:07] disobedient to
[8:09] parents teenage taking over the world
[8:12] and it's done
[8:14] it I went into a place the other day
[8:17] there playing this one of these old
[8:18] dirty Juke boxes all that stuff I didn't
[8:20] even want to take my family I said to
[8:22] that lady how much is them records cost
[8:24] 10 cents a piece how many would have
[8:25] play an hour she told me I said here's
[8:27] the money unplug it well she said I
[8:30] couldn't do that them kids come in here
[8:32] to play that then I couldn't spend no
[8:33] money there I went somewhere else see
[8:36] well that stuff that make you nervous
[8:37] you'd have to go down and get a bunch of
[8:41] prizers to say actually hearing the
[8:44] crazy
[8:46] stuff that just irks a
[8:49] Christian if you like that kind of stuff
[8:51] you know what's wrong with you you need
[8:53] to get saved cuz what's in you is
[8:55] feeding on something besides the word
[8:58] it's feeding on you couldn't imagine
[8:59] Jesus doing a thing like that could you
[9:01] could you imagine one of the prophets
[9:02] doing such a thing don't you see fans
[9:05] the whole thing all over is the
[9:08] devil and the Bible said how he would
[9:11] come in form of religion and just do
[9:14] just exactly like the Christ see but the
[9:16] only way you'll ever be able to tell it
[9:18] is not join this church or join that
[9:20] church stay with the word he is the word
[9:24] but in the days of the voice of the
[9:26] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[9:28] sound the mystery of God should be
[9:30] finished as he hath declared to his
[9:32] servants the prophets
