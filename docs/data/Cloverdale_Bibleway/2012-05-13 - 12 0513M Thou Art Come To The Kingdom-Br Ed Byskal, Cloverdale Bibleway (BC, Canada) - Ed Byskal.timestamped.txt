[21:05] Blessed be your name, Lord Jesus. We ask
[21:08] you all this blessing in the name of the

[21:15] [Music]
[21:16] &gt;&gt; God bless you this morning. As you have
[21:18] your seats as the Sunday school children
[21:20] are making their way in, we're going to
[21:22] have the choir come right up.
[21:26] So, I've just got as the choir comes up,
[21:28] we've just got two announcements,
[21:35] have everybody
[21:38] coming in.
[21:49] If I make the announcement while
[21:50] everybody's coming up here, 50% of us
[21:52] miss it.
[21:55] That's a pretty big risk. If you're in
[21:58] risk management, that's a probably a
[21:59] risk you don't want to take, right?
[22:01] There's probably insurance people out
[22:03] there that would say that's not a that's
[22:04] not a safe bet. I wouldn't go with that
[22:06] statistic. All right. So, two
[22:08] announcements this morning. So, a late
[22:11] afternoon lunch is being provided by the
[22:13] sisters of the church here in the
[22:16] gymnasium of the school. That'll be next
[22:19] Sunday afternoon at 4:30.
[22:22] So for the sisters and the families,
[22:24] please bring all prepared food and
[22:26] coolers to the church fellowship room
[22:28] and place on the tables provided. If you
[22:31] have any questions, you may contact the
[22:33] office. I believe an email has gone out.
[22:35] Phone calls have been made. So if you
[22:37] haven't been contacted and you're not
[22:39] sure what to do, just make sure that you
[22:41] um touch base with somebody in the
[22:43] office. And we certainly appreciate all
[22:45] the labor of love that's going into
[22:47] these meetings next weekend. It's going
[22:48] to just be a real wonderful time. Now,
[22:51] for those that missed it, happy Mother's
[22:54] Day for the mothers that didn't make it
[22:56] in. The last announcement we've got is
[22:58] we want to take a photograph um of
[23:01] everybody in the congregation
[23:02] immediately after the service after it's
[23:04] been dismissed. So, if everybody can
[23:06] just go outside on the east side of the
[23:08] building, we'll take a photograph for
[23:10] the collage of photos that we want to
[23:11] have for the meetings this weekend. Is
[23:13] that clear?
[23:16] &gt;&gt; I got two. Is that all right?
[23:18] &gt;&gt; All right. Right. Well, we're going to
[23:19] enjoy a wonderful special this morning.

[32:39] that you love me.
[32:43] I see
[32:46] that you came
[32:50] through your preious
[32:53] blood. I found
[32:58] my sush
[33:04] away. All my sins
[33:08] are wash
[33:10] away. Yes, I believe.
[33:14] I believe
[33:17] that you love me.
[33:28] [Music]
[33:33] I found
[33:37] and my sins
[33:39] are
[33:41] there. All wash away. All my sins
[33:47] are wash
[33:49] away.
[33:50] [Music]
[33:54] Amen.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; No wonder they people can sing and we
[33:59] can sing. Hallelujah.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Ryan, for that song
[34:04] and the choir. Thank you. God bless you
[34:06] each one. We I enjoyed that. I I just
[34:10] are worshiping with you. I don't know
[34:11] what the next line melody is, but I just
[34:14] sang with it anyway because it kind of
[34:16] flows along. You can kind of sing in the
[34:18] spirit, you know, just kind of get on
[34:20] the note and stay with it.
[34:23] Is that all right?
[34:25] Hallelujah.
[34:27] Uh
[34:29] I know that you've heard the
[34:30] announcements and uh we want to get
[34:32] right into the word as quickly as
[34:34] possible, but we do certainly want to
[34:36] honor and greet our the mothers in the
[34:39] congregation.
[34:40] Uh mothers, grandmothers, whatever more.
[34:43] And we're we appreciate you. Uh if it
[34:46] wasn't for our mothers, we wouldn't be
[34:48] around, would we? So we thank them. And
[34:52] uh a lot of the mothers perhaps are not
[34:54] here. There may be elsewhere. And we
[34:58] want to give thanks to God for godly
[35:01] women and mothers in the congregation.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; No service this Wednesday
[35:09] as you have heard before announced. No
[35:12] service this Wednesday
[35:14] and people actually are beginning to
[35:16] arrive on Thursday. Some ministers will
[35:19] be arriving on Thursday as well. and
[35:22] Friday from 2:00 to 5:00 over in the gym
[35:27] auditorium. And that's what I call it,
[35:29] not the gym, but I call it the gym
[35:31] auditorium because the church is going
[35:33] to be using it. Also, we will have a get
[35:36] acquainted time, just a little informal
[35:39] time if you like to slip by and meet
[35:42] some of the people that perhaps have
[35:43] arrived by that time. And that will be
[35:47] that will just be from 2:00 to 5:00. At
[35:49] 5:00, it's over. And uh at 7:30 will be
[35:53] the service. Brother Tim Puit will be
[35:55] preaching at 7:30.
[35:57] Saturday morning at 10:00 a.m. Brother
[36:01] Ron Spencer will be speaking.
[36:04] And then Saturday evening at 7:30,
[36:08] Brother Timuit again.
[36:11] Sunday is a full day and we want this
[36:15] time to be a time of thanksgiving and
[36:18] worship. And so what we're doing, the
[36:20] services are intended. And I I trust
[36:23] that the word will come to you in such a
[36:25] way that you will be lifted up to give
[36:29] glory to God. And that's the only thing
[36:31] that we're really interested in. To him
[36:34] be all the glory.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Anything that's been done, he has done.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; Anyone who's saved here, he has saved
[36:42] &gt;&gt; and he's the author of salvation. And we
[36:44] give him praise.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's all these meetings are
[36:48] about. But on Sunday morning, we have
[36:51] announced on the announcement 11:00
[36:54] service, but we want to just move that
[36:57] up a wee bit. And I would like for as
[37:00] many as possible, the whole congregation
[37:02] if possible. Uh we should be here by
[37:04] 10:30. We want to start the song service
[37:08] as soon after that as possible. and and
[37:12] by 11 or just ahead of 11:00
[37:15] uh we want to
[37:19] it's not a presentation
[37:21] but it is to give an overview
[37:25] of the 40 years of time and there's been
[37:29] quite a bit of work that's been put into
[37:31] it. I haven't put a lot into it. Just
[37:33] have had the concept and the idea. But I
[37:37] believe that you will hear things that
[37:39] you hadn't heard before, discover things
[37:42] you had not heard of, and see things
[37:45] perhaps you hadn't seen before. We
[37:48] encourage you to be here. It will be a
[37:50] wonderful, wonderful service. And uh
[37:54] that part will probably take uh maybe
[37:58] close to an hour or just a little
[38:00] better. And we're going to get the
[38:02] service directly over to brother Tim
[38:04] Puit who is going to be preaching the um
[38:09] main that will be the main anniversary
[38:11] service. Uh I've spoken with brother
[38:14] Puit. I spoke also with brother Ron
[38:16] Spencer and uh it just the grace of God
[38:20] both on their own have said God has
[38:23] given them a direction for the service
[38:26] &gt;&gt; and I thank God for that. Amen.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; I thank God for that. Yesterday was a
[38:32] wonderful day. Also, we uh we have uh I
[38:36] perhaps should just finish with this. Uh
[38:39] after the morning service, then as has
[38:42] been announced late in the afternoon,
[38:44] later in the afternoon, there will be a
[38:47] lunchon for everyone.
[38:49] And uh uh I want to thank Sister Karen
[38:53] Ashdown for taking a hold of that. We
[38:56] were just going to have like coffee and
[38:58] desserts because it was such a mammoth
[39:00] task to try to feed everyone and you
[39:04] know you start having trying to feed
[39:06] five or 6 hundred people. But we just
[39:08] decided we might as well bite the
[39:11] bullet. At least they decided that and
[39:14] are going to set up tables over in the
[39:16] gymnasium. Uh the subfloor is down and
[39:21] uh brother brother Derek I believe is
[39:23] going to bring the excess carpet that uh
[39:26] from the camp and so we'll be able to
[39:28] lay the carpet down and just roll it out
[39:31] and have the tables there and be able to
[39:34] feed everybody and I understand that's
[39:36] been announced as 4:30. Is that right,
[39:38] Sister Karen? 4:30. So I want to thank
[39:41] you ladies for uh your contribution and
[39:45] bringing the food and so on and we want
[39:48] you to be able to have a wonderful time.
[39:50] We trust that this will be uh etched in
[39:55] our memory
[39:57] &gt;&gt; and let us remember what God has done
[40:01] &gt;&gt; and the Bible encouraged the people you
[40:03] tell your children
[40:05] &gt;&gt; so what God did
[40:07] &gt;&gt; and tell them how God delivered you. out
[40:10] of bondage. And this is one thing,
[40:12] friends, we never want to forget.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; It always comes alive again. Tell them
[40:16] how tell the children how God delivered
[40:19] you out of bondage and where you came
[40:22] from.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; And then and then that will merge right
[40:27] into the evening gathering. We're going
[40:29] to remain over in the auditorium.
[40:32] Uh there will be some singing and
[40:34] perhaps some uh greetings and there's
[40:38] going to be a number of ministers here
[40:39] that won't have an opportunity to speak
[40:41] but we would want to be able to have a
[40:44] chance to have them presented before you
[40:46] and give a greeting to you. Now I have
[40:50] another uh an announcement which is
[40:53] going to be a surprise to most
[40:56] everybody.
[40:58] Uh we were going to have uh we were
[41:02] going to have the dedication of the
[41:04] school on either the first weekend of J
[41:09] of June or the second weekend of June
[41:12] and I had invited brother Donnie Reagan
[41:14] to come and be with us and uh I gave him
[41:18] the two weekends and he I before I did I
[41:21] said we'd like him to come and do a
[41:22] dedication. and he said, "I will
[41:24] certainly pray about that and thank you
[41:26] for the invitation." And then when I
[41:29] gave him the two weekends, he said,
[41:31] "Well," he said, "I'm so sorry." The
[41:34] first weekend he has brother Paul Laf
[41:36] Fontaine coming down and having special
[41:38] meetings and the ne and the second week
[41:41] they actually are having like a a Bible
[41:44] youth Bible school for the church and
[41:48] the and then they have a special uh a
[41:52] series of services at the second weekend
[41:55] with the young people, the senior young
[41:57] people and he just wasn't able to come.
[42:00] So, I just I just left it like that and
[42:04] uh I I started to feel directed to move
[42:09] the dedication up close right behind the
[42:12] anniversary services. And so, we're
[42:15] going to have on the following Friday,
[42:19] the 25th, there will be no Wednesday
[42:21] service that week either. And we'll
[42:24] following Friday on the 25th, we're
[42:27] going to have the dedication of the
[42:29] school. And one of the reasons for that
[42:31] is we already have uh uh we'll have the
[42:34] platform there uh all set up. It's a
[42:37] portable platform and it'll be set up as
[42:39] a result of the anniversary meetings.
[42:41] That way we'll just be able to leave the
[42:44] platform there and go directly into the
[42:47] dedication service. So that will be on
[42:50] Friday evening on the 25th of May.
[42:55] Amen.
[42:57] I see a few people freeze up. They think
[43:00] we have to have all of that ready.
[43:02] There's nothing really to be ready. We
[43:03] just go there relaxed and just do it.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to give glory to God.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and give you a chance for
[43:14] some of you people who haven't been in
[43:15] there to see where half of this
[43:17] congregation is, at least half of it's
[43:19] been working for the for the last couple
[43:22] years. And we're thankful to God.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for standing and
[43:28] remaining. Um we're going to turn to the
[43:32] word, but just before we do, I wonder if
[43:35] you would bow your head and let us pray
[43:38] together.
[43:42] Dear Lord Jesus,
[43:47] this service would be nothing without
[43:50] you.
[43:52] We thank you for your divine presence.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; We sense your nearness.
[43:58] You have heard the worship.
[44:01] Not only heard the worship, you have
[44:03] received the worship.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Our prophet has said that's what made
[44:07] you God. when you created angels and
[44:11] they worshiped you. And Father, we
[44:14] willingly and with all of our with all
[44:16] of our hearts and souls, we worship you.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; You're the only true God. You're the God
[44:24] of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.
[44:26] You're the holy one of Israel. You are
[44:30] the God that has restored your word to
[44:32] us. Where would we be, Lord, if we did
[44:35] not have this restored word? Thank you
[44:38] for an uncompromising messenger,
[44:40] prophet, messenger delivered. Thank you,
[44:43] oh God, for your clear uh proof and and
[44:47] and vindication that you just would not
[44:51] allow any of his words to fall to the
[44:53] ground. We thank you for it. And now we
[44:55] can come with such confidence, oh God.
[44:58] And we pray that you will bring this
[45:00] reality to our hearts. Anoint your
[45:03] servant, Father, and anoint your
[45:05] servants that hear the word of God. May
[45:08] we be strengthened thereby the name of
[45:11] Jesus Christ. And let the congregation
[45:14] join together in how the Lord Jesus
[45:17] taught us to pray. Our Father, which art
[45:21] in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy
[45:26] kingdom come, thy will be done on earth
[45:30] as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
[45:34] daily bread, and forgive us our
[45:37] trespasses as we forgive those who
[45:40] trespass against us, and lead us not
[45:43] into temptation, but deliver us from
[45:46] evil. For thine is the kingdom, the
[45:50] power, and the glory forever and ever.
[45:54] Amen. and the people can say once again,
[45:57] amen.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; I thank you for standing. Turn in your
[46:03] Bibles if you would please to Isaiah the
[46:06] 40th chapter
[46:15] and we'll start at verse 15.
[46:34] Read down to verse 18.
[46:38] Behold, the nations are as a drop of a
[46:40] bucket, and are counted as the small
[46:44] dust of the balance. Behold, he taketh
[46:47] up the isisles as a very little thing.
[46:50] All nations before him are as nothing,
[46:54] and they are counted to him less than
[46:56] nothing, and vanity. To whom then will
[47:00] we liken God? Or what likeness will you
[47:04] compare unto him?
[47:06] Look down to verse 24, please.
[47:10] Yay, they shall not be planted. He was
[47:13] speaking now of Israel. Yay, they shall
[47:15] not be sown. Yay, their stalk shall not
[47:19] take root in the earth, and he shall
[47:22] also blow upon them, and they shall
[47:25] wither, and the whirlwind shall take
[47:28] them away as stubble. I would like you
[47:31] to turn to the book of Daniel, please,
[47:34] the fourth chapter,
[47:36] and we'll read from verse 29.
[47:44] Daniel 4:29.
[47:50] And now as we begin to read, if you
[47:52] would please remember that Daniel and
[47:54] his friends have been taken captive
[48:00] and uh Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon,
[48:05] one of the most majestic
[48:08] and uh greatest of kingdoms.
[48:12] Uh this is written of him
[48:17] and Daniel, he has had a dream. not
[48:19] Daniel, but the Nebuchadnezzar has had a
[48:21] dream and he's seen this great tree
[48:26] uh spread out and the fruit and so on
[48:28] and so forth and he was troubled about
[48:30] it and there was nobody that could
[48:32] interpret the dream uh and he called
[48:35] Daniel. He always had confidence in
[48:37] Daniel and so Daniel has interpreted the
[48:40] dream and this is part of it. Verse 29.
[48:44] At the end of 12 months, he walked in
[48:48] the palaces palace of the kingdom of
[48:50] Babylon that is Nebuchadnezzar. The king
[48:54] spake and said, "Is not this great
[48:57] Babylon that I have built for this for
[48:59] the house of the kingdom by the might of
[49:02] my power and for the honor of my
[49:05] majesty?" And while the word was yet in
[49:08] the king's mouth, there fell a voice
[49:10] from heaven, saying, "Oh King
[49:12] Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken,
[49:14] the kingdom is departed from thee, and
[49:17] they shall drive thee from men, and thy
[49:21] dwelling shall be with the beasts of the
[49:23] field. They shall not make thee to eat I
[49:27] rather they shall make thee to eat grass
[49:30] as oxen and seven times shall pass over
[49:34] thee until thou know that the most high
[49:37] ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth
[49:41] it to whomsoever he will. The same hour
[49:44] was the thing fulfilled upon
[49:46] Nebuchadnezzar.
[49:47] And he was driven from men and did eat
[49:50] grass as oxmen. And his body was wet
[49:54] with the dew of heaven till his hairs
[49:56] were grown like eagle's feathers and his
[49:59] nails like bird's claws.
[50:02] And at the end of the day, I
[50:04] Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto
[50:06] heaven, and mine understanding returned
[50:08] unto me. And I blessed the most high.
[50:11] And I praised and honored him that
[50:13] liveth forever. Uh whose dominion is an
[50:17] everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is
[50:20] from generation to generation. And all
[50:22] the inhabitants of the earth are reputed
[50:25] as nothing. And he doeth according to
[50:28] his will in the army of heaven, and
[50:31] among the inhabitants of the earth, and
[50:33] none can stay his hand, or say unto him,
[50:36] "What doest thou?" At the same time, my
[50:40] reason returned unto me, and for the
[50:43] glory of my kingdom, mine honor and
[50:45] brightness returned unto me, and my
[50:47] counselors, and my lord sought me unto
[50:50] me, and I was established in my kingdom,
[50:53] and excellent majesty was added unto me.
[50:56] Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol
[51:00] and honor the king of heaven all whose
[51:03] works are truth and his ways judgment
[51:08] and those that walk in pride he is able
[51:10] to obey.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful reading. You may be
[51:15] seated.
[51:19] I I would ask for your full attention,
[51:21] please, and just as little movement as
[51:23] possible because not for my sake, but
[51:26] for the sake of those that are around
[51:27] you and I I need your
[51:32] full attention as I'm I'm striving to
[51:34] move in a thought and I would like to
[51:37] convey it to you. I want it to have its
[51:40] full depth of meaning as it has
[51:41] impressed myself as well.
[51:44] I want to say as a beginning all nations
[51:48] and humanity is truly in God's hand. God
[51:52] lifts up who he will and God destroys
[51:55] who he will. He lifts up who he will and
[51:58] he puts down who he will. All kingdoms
[52:01] rise and fall. Civilizations rise and
[52:04] fall and uh uh they rise to the heights
[52:08] of their majesty and disappear in the
[52:12] sands of time and God is in control of
[52:15] it all.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Nothing is out of God's hands.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Uh the Bible says, and this is for our
[52:23] certainly for I I trust will be for your
[52:26] benefit. I just trust it'll be more than
[52:28] a message to you. Jesus said when he
[52:33] told of the tears and the wheat that was
[52:35] sown, he answered and said unto them,
[52:38] because they had asked him, he that seth
[52:40] the good seed is the son of man. And I
[52:43] want to say to this congregation and all
[52:45] that are listening, you are not in
[52:48] control of your own life.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; God planted you here in the earth. And
[52:53] for those that are the elect
[52:55] predestinated of God, God had a design
[52:59] and a plan and a purpose in bringing you
[53:02] here at this time,
[53:04] &gt;&gt; at this season. And we want to I have
[53:08] titled this message, thou art come to
[53:10] the kingdom for such a time as this. the
[53:14] words of Mori to Esther when she thought
[53:17] that perhaps she would get by without
[53:20] the uh wi-i without the persecution that
[53:23] was coming upon the Jews h in the
[53:26] kingdom at that time and her her uh they
[53:29] say uncle it wasn't her uncle but one
[53:32] who had adopted her daughter daughter
[53:34] Mori he said to her that you have come
[53:37] to the kingdom for such a time as this
[53:40] and don't think for a moment that you'll
[53:41] escape and if you do not do what God has
[53:44] called you to do. God will raise up
[53:46] someone else from someplace and he will
[53:48] do it.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; So he was giving just absolute
[53:51] confidence in God that this is going to
[53:54] happen anyway. God is not going to
[53:56] permit his people to be destroyed and
[53:59] God has raised you up for such a time as
[54:01] this. And I want to say to this
[54:03] congregation and I trust it will just go
[54:06] right down to the very depths of your
[54:08] soul. There has not ever been a people
[54:11] that has had the word revealed to them
[54:15] through such a profound ministry as we
[54:18] have had. And we are accountable for
[54:21] what God has given us.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; And do you understand that?
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Everyone understand that
[54:27] &gt;&gt; this is not something that God has taken
[54:29] lightly. There is you can search church
[54:31] history if you want. And there has never
[54:34] been a time that there has been such a
[54:36] messenger with such a proof of ministry,
[54:39] such a vindication that went on for so
[54:42] many years. And and if you even have a
[54:45] hesitation at what I'm saying, you need
[54:47] to ask yourself uh can I find such a
[54:50] thing? And if not, why did God do that?
[54:53] Because that is a supernatural act of
[54:55] almighty God
[54:56] &gt;&gt; is great as anything you can read in the
[54:58] scripture because it was none other than
[55:01] the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; And he said he that sweth the good seed
[55:06] is the son of man.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; The son of man has sown the good seed.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Your mother and father did not sow the
[55:13] good seed
[55:15] &gt;&gt; by by your mother's death. And we thank
[55:17] God for Mother's Day. But by mother's by
[55:20] mother's uh by our birth, by mother's
[55:23] by our mother, we die.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Everybody.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Everybody.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; We're all aging and we will die.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Unless we're changed and go in a
[55:33] rapture.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; But by our by the birth, by the second
[55:37] birth, we live.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "The field is the
[55:42] world and the good seed are the children
[55:45] of the kingdom and the tears are the
[55:47] children of the wicked one to
[55:50] &gt;&gt; and a subject."
[55:52] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Those are the words of Jesus Christ. And
[55:56] we accept that.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Now to kind of set the scene just a wee
[56:01] bit, I read also from Isaiah 61 and3.
[56:05] And this is the uh this is brother
[56:08] Brandham's text for shalom.
[56:10] So he says, "Arise,
[56:13] shine,
[56:14] for thy light is come, and the glory of
[56:17] the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold,
[56:21] the darkness shall cover the earth, and
[56:24] gross darkness the people, but the Lord
[56:27] shall arise upon thee,
[56:30] &gt;&gt; and his glory shall shine upon thee."
[56:33] Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; This is such a paradox
[56:36] &gt;&gt; uh that arise and shine for your light
[56:40] has come but darkness and gross darkness
[56:43] upon the people.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Uh this and another scripture I want to
[56:48] read is setting a stage. I won't
[56:50] apologize for reading these scriptures
[56:52] but please catch the theme of them
[56:54] because I need to make a a curve in my
[56:57] service just immediately.
[56:59] He uh God spoke to Jeremiah and told
[57:02] him, "Go down to the potter's house and
[57:04] I'm going to speak to you there." So, he
[57:07] went down to the potter's house and he
[57:08] watched the potter when making a a
[57:11] vessel, but the vessel had a mo in it.
[57:14] And so, he he took it apart and and uh
[57:18] and restarted all over again and remade
[57:21] it so that he didn't have a mar in it.
[57:25] And uh he said Jeremiah said, "I went
[57:28] down to the potter's house, and behold,
[57:30] he wrought a work on the wheels."
[57:34] &gt;&gt; And and the vessel that he made of clay
[57:37] was marred in the hand of the potter. So
[57:40] he made it again another vessel,
[57:44] &gt;&gt; another vessel.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; So it had perhaps a different form, a
[57:48] different shape, a different something,
[57:49] but it was another vessel
[57:52] &gt;&gt; as it seemed good to the potter. And
[57:54] then the word of the Lord came to me,
[57:56] saying, "Oh house of Israel, cannot I do
[57:58] with you as this potter, sayeth the
[58:01] Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the
[58:03] potter's hand, so are ye in my hand, oh
[58:07] house of David." I want to say to the
[58:09] waiting congregation that God sent this
[58:14] word and we can say perhaps different
[58:17] people uh we differently may have a
[58:19] different emphasis upon the message.
[58:21] Some of you have been born in in message
[58:24] believing homes and you maybe don't have
[58:26] you don't see it from the same
[58:28] perspective and others uh such as myself
[58:32] I've seen it for many years and am just
[58:34] amazed I'm amazed I'm amazed at the
[58:37] grace of God I said what grace is this
[58:39] why are we worthy to have such a such a
[58:43] incredible ministry I want to say that
[58:46] whatever you view or see within the
[58:49] message or within the movement ment of
[58:51] the of the people of believers of this
[58:54] time as I viewed Pentecost and viewed
[58:57] the denominations and we viewed what is
[59:00] happening. Whatever it is that you view,
[59:02] I just want to make one declaration very
[59:04] clear. God is going to achieve exactly
[59:09] for the whole purpose that he sent this
[59:11] word. He's going to achieve it
[59:14] &gt;&gt; whether you're in it or I'm in it or
[59:17] not. He's going to achieve it. He's
[59:19] going to bring it to pass.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; And I and because I know that because I
[59:24] have that confidence in it, I say, "Oh
[59:26] God,
[59:27] &gt;&gt; allow your grace,
[59:30] &gt;&gt; allow your sufficiency to come to this
[59:32] poor soul
[59:34] &gt;&gt; that I and you might be in that."
[59:39] &gt;&gt; I want to say with the messenger, don't
[59:41] miss it.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; You don't have to miss it. And that's
[59:46] not something that is should bring fear
[59:48] to anybody. But don't miss it. In other
[59:50] words, put your whole focus. That's why
[59:53] you're here. That's why God planted you
[59:55] in the earth.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; He planted you for that purpose.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Not not from some human purpose. He
[1:00:03] planted you here for his purpose.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; We say, "Oh God, thy will be done."
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Whatever your purpose is, let it be
[1:00:12] done.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; There was a writer,
[1:00:21] he's a Jewish writer, and he's written a
[1:00:23] little history of the Jews. And I wonder
[1:00:27] if you would just bear with me as I
[1:00:29] read.
[1:00:31] Uh, has anyone here read the
[1:00:34] indestructible Jews?
[1:00:40] This man had a I won't say much about
[1:00:42] it, but I think he had a has an
[1:00:44] incredible grasp
[1:00:47] of uh
[1:00:49] of the Jews within world history. And
[1:00:53] and so this is not a bunch of dry
[1:00:55] history, but he explained the difference
[1:00:58] and I have gone into also the difference
[1:01:00] between
[1:01:02] between dynasties. He said
[1:01:06] uh world history
[1:01:08] is not a succession of dynasties.
[1:01:12] Dynasties being like they have in
[1:01:14] England for example. You know it's a
[1:01:16] family a royal family goes on down from
[1:01:19] you know father to son or mother queen
[1:01:21] to son and whatever more and there's all
[1:01:25] you know the papers are always full of
[1:01:27] who's going to be the next one in
[1:01:29] England to sit on the throne. That's a
[1:01:32] dynasty.
[1:01:33] But this gentleman, he says, "The world
[1:01:36] history is not a succession of
[1:01:39] dynasties, but rather
[1:01:42] tidal waves of civilization."
[1:01:47] And he says, "The and he just starts in
[1:01:50] this very brief, and I'm going to read
[1:01:51] it. The Aadian,
[1:01:54] Sumerian,
[1:01:56] and Egyptian,
[1:01:58] he's speaking of their civilizations.
[1:02:00] these civilizations
[1:02:02] sweeps in on the shores of the planet
[1:02:04] earth
[1:02:06] followed by the emergence of the
[1:02:08] Babylonian and Assyrian emperor empires
[1:02:14] and that was very much in Daniel's time
[1:02:16] and also Esther's time. These give wave
[1:02:20] to the Persian title wave of success.
[1:02:24] Persia is washed away by the Greek idea
[1:02:28] and then the Greeks are engulfed by the
[1:02:30] legions of Rome.
[1:02:33] And next the Byzantine and Islamic
[1:02:35] civilization flood
[1:02:38] o flood over the shores of history and
[1:02:41] feudalism arises in Europe.
[1:02:44] Finally, we see the modern age weighed
[1:02:47] in on the wave of capitalism and
[1:02:49] industrialism.
[1:02:51] But where are the Jews?
[1:02:55] We have raced through 5,000 years of
[1:02:59] history and not beheld a single one.
[1:03:03] We know that they are there somewhere.
[1:03:07] So we look again and more closely and we
[1:03:11] do see them riding cultural surfboards
[1:03:15] on the crests of these tidal waves
[1:03:19] precariously bobbing up and down with
[1:03:22] the rising and falling fortunes of these
[1:03:24] civilizations.
[1:03:26] And after the flow of a civilization has
[1:03:29] reached its high point,
[1:03:32] we see it slowly eb and ultimately sink
[1:03:35] into the depths of historical oblivion.
[1:03:40] And we see the Jew in that civilization
[1:03:43] go down with it.
[1:03:46] But whereas each sunken civilization, I
[1:03:49] want you to listen close now. This is
[1:03:50] where I'm coming to. Whereas each sunken
[1:03:53] civilization remains submerged,
[1:03:58] the Jews emerge time and again from
[1:04:02] seemingly doom, riding the crest of a
[1:04:06] new civilization,
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; rolling in where the old one flowed out.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; We see the Jews make their first
[1:04:14] appearance in history in the Babylonian
[1:04:17] world
[1:04:19] about 2000 BC. when the Babylonian state
[1:04:23] disappears. And I just want to stop
[1:04:26] there. Daniel saw Babylon
[1:04:30] and he said to the king of Babylon,
[1:04:32] "You've seen this great image with the
[1:04:36] head of gold and the arms and the breast
[1:04:40] of silver. And each of the four were
[1:04:43] inferior." and your prophet told you
[1:04:47] that you are in the toes of iron and
[1:04:50] clay.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Don't forget and don't think for a
[1:04:55] moment that we are living as the elites
[1:04:58] of civilization.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; The elite was a head of gold
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; and the majesty and the glory and the
[1:05:07] power of that kingdom of head of gold.
[1:05:10] We don't we're not even hardly in the
[1:05:12] picture.
[1:05:15] We've got a lot of fluff.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; We got a lot of plastic.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; We got a lot of
[1:05:22] illusionary things.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; And Satan has set up in this age of
[1:05:27] deception to make us think this is so
[1:05:30] glamorous and that it's empty and it's
[1:05:33] vain and it is nothing.
[1:05:37] That kingdom of the head of gold was
[1:05:40] certainly a great Babylonian. And that's
[1:05:43] when the Jews appeared as Jews, not
[1:05:45] Hebrews necessarily, but the Jews. And
[1:05:48] he says, "And the state disappears and
[1:05:52] the Jews make their entry in the Persian
[1:05:54] Empire.
[1:05:56] As the Persian as the Persian world
[1:05:59] disintegrates, they announce their debut
[1:06:02] in the Helenic drawing room. And when
[1:06:06] Rome conquers the world, they settle in
[1:06:09] Western Europe, helping the Romans carry
[1:06:12] the banners of business enterprise into
[1:06:16] the barbaric Gaul. And when the star of
[1:06:19] Islam rises, the Jews rise with it to a
[1:06:23] golden age of intellectual creativity.
[1:06:26] And when feudalism settles over Europe,
[1:06:30] they open up shop as the bankers and
[1:06:32] scholars. And when the modern age struts
[1:06:36] in, we find them sitting in the
[1:06:38] architectural staff shaping it. What can
[1:06:42] we make of these events?
[1:06:45] Are they mere accidents of history?
[1:06:49] Are they but meaningless facts? Or does
[1:06:53] this improbable succession of events
[1:06:56] have a predetermined purpose?
[1:06:59] If so, who drafted such a blueprint?
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; God or the Jews themselves?
[1:07:08] I want to go from there to say that God
[1:07:12] planted not only the Jews in the earth
[1:07:15] at a certain time, not only Esther and
[1:07:18] Mori at that critical moment and she was
[1:07:22] finally possessed of a spirit say if I
[1:07:25] perish I perish. But I go in at this
[1:07:29] critical moment and as I closed last
[1:07:31] Sunday and two people saved a nation
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; and I want to say to you uh
[1:07:38] unequivocally you do not know what your
[1:07:41] sole purpose is in earth and you will
[1:07:43] not discover it until you've crossed
[1:07:45] over.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says every person
[1:07:49] influences somebody. You are influencing
[1:07:52] somebody. May God anoint you and fulfill
[1:07:57] you and fill you with the spirit of God
[1:08:00] to send someone upward
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; to send someone into this rapture
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; place condition
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; in the message show us the father and
[1:08:14] it'll satisfy us. He says, "To you that
[1:08:17] are born again of the spirit of God,
[1:08:19] when God planted you in Christ Jesus,
[1:08:23] which is the inexhaustible fountain of
[1:08:25] life,
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; everything you have, everything you have
[1:08:29] need of was put in you when you received
[1:08:32] the Holy Ghost."
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Everything you have
[1:08:37] need of was placed in you when you
[1:08:40] receive the Holy Ghost for your life's
[1:08:42] journey, for your healing, for your joy,
[1:08:44] for your happiness.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; We need to have the big picture. I
[1:08:50] enjoyed so much our brother Killet spoke
[1:08:53] on uh Wednesday evening
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; and he he he spoke on and I I I really
[1:09:01] uh trusted you were listening close and
[1:09:04] for those you that weren't here you can
[1:09:05] hear it on the archives but he just said
[1:09:08] you know it's it's one thing to see the
[1:09:09] big picture to see he wasn't using those
[1:09:12] words but to see you know the bride the
[1:09:14] whole body of believers etc etc but we
[1:09:17] need to identify ourselves individually
[1:09:20] and he spoke to the individual and I
[1:09:22] really appreciated that. Now I now I
[1:09:24] want to just take the big picture and I
[1:09:26] want to be able to say that you know you
[1:09:28] need to see the big picture but you need
[1:09:30] to see yourself as an individual within
[1:09:33] that big picture.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; It's not enough just to say you know the
[1:09:36] Christians or the bride or the message
[1:09:39] that's not sufficient. You got to see me
[1:09:41] in that. Amen.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; So we need to see that. Brother Brandham
[1:09:49] says, notice closely. He says, "I'm an
[1:09:52] American.
[1:09:54] I'm an American." And yet he was part of
[1:09:56] a bigger picture. He carried that
[1:09:58] forward in his testimony in the message
[1:10:01] testimony said, "I'm an American.
[1:10:04] Generation after generation back to the
[1:10:06] third or fourth generation uh been
[1:10:09] American. Many brands been planted and
[1:10:12] he breaks it. See how the other day he
[1:10:15] says I was walking through France and
[1:10:17] many of them laying there fell in the
[1:10:20] war. I had four brothers
[1:10:23] uh in this last one in this last war. He
[1:10:27] says one of them helped me in the prayer
[1:10:29] line. In fact, as I was in a meeting and
[1:10:31] I saw that was his brother Howard saw
[1:10:35] helped him in the prayer line. He says
[1:10:37] where he has had four years in the Navy
[1:10:40] and give up as a hopeless case, hundreds
[1:10:43] disabled. And he got on to speak about,
[1:10:46] you know, those that had suffered and so
[1:10:47] on. But then at the end, he said,
[1:10:50] "That's right. I'm an American, but just
[1:10:53] as sure as I'm the minister standing in
[1:10:56] this platform. We're heading for
[1:10:58] judgment."
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; So on the one hand, he says, "I, as an
[1:11:02] individual, I'm an American." But he
[1:11:04] didn't get he didn't lose sight of the
[1:11:06] big picture. But as a nation, we're
[1:11:09] heading he said, "As sure as I'm
[1:11:11] standing here, we're heading for
[1:11:13] judgment."
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Now listen to me, friends. Please listen
[1:11:17] to me today. And I want this to be
[1:11:20] inscribed into your very mind and soul.
[1:11:25] We are in a civilization that's in
[1:11:28] demise. Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; This civilization is heading for
[1:11:34] disintegration.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; This civilization is heading for death.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; As certain as you're breathing God's
[1:11:41] free air,
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; this civilization is headed for death.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, if you open your eyes,
[1:11:47] you'll see death everywhere.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; You'll see it expressed in the minds and
[1:11:53] faces of the people.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; You'll see it on the streets. You'll see
[1:11:57] it in the malls. You'll see it in the
[1:11:59] young people. You'll see it in the
[1:12:01] elderly. This this is a civilization not
[1:12:04] heading to majesty and glory, but this
[1:12:07] civilization is heading for death.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; It's everywhere.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; It's laden with sin.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; It's being washed with sin and iniquity
[1:12:18] and evil. And we certainly have come to
[1:12:20] the days of Noah where it says that the
[1:12:23] thoughts of men's hearts was only only
[1:12:27] evil evil continually.
[1:12:30] [Applause]
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham speaks with a sense
[1:12:35] of pride about his country.
[1:12:39] He does say I'm thankful to be an
[1:12:41] American.
[1:12:42] He says I'm glad that I'm an American
[1:12:45] and thankful for it. He said he'd sooner
[1:12:48] be there or in Canada. He said they're
[1:12:50] twin sisters or their sisters. And then
[1:12:53] he says,
[1:12:55] uh, and I'm glad to be an American and
[1:12:57] thankful for it, but I tell you, it
[1:12:59] certainly needs a counter revival. It
[1:13:01] sure does. And it will not get it. Isn't
[1:13:06] it incredible how truthful and how
[1:13:09] forward? And if you get those nuggets,
[1:13:12] you can you can just say, "Thus sayaith
[1:13:14] the Lord after it." They need a revival
[1:13:17] but they will not get it. And he speaks
[1:13:20] also that it turned it aside. He even
[1:13:23] gives a year 1956.
[1:13:26] And after that he said they turned it
[1:13:27] aside. And I can tell you, I was living
[1:13:30] at that time, just married a couple of
[1:13:32] years at that time, and the country was
[1:13:34] absolutely a wash with great revivals
[1:13:37] and tents and speakers and healings and
[1:13:41] miracles of every kind, north and south,
[1:13:44] and other places in the world. But did
[1:13:46] they get a revival? No.
[1:13:49] And then God came with a revival for the
[1:13:51] bride, a revival of the restored word of
[1:13:55] God. And those multitudes that were
[1:13:58] there, just a sea of humanity for the
[1:14:01] most part missed it. But one here, one
[1:14:04] there, one over there. And I thank God I
[1:14:08] can say one here.
[1:14:13] And it took a while to find out you've
[1:14:15] come to the kingdom for such a time as
[1:14:18] this.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; I sat as a young person where you young
[1:14:21] people are sitting. I sat as a young
[1:14:23] married man with young babies and
[1:14:26] children where you people are sitting.
[1:14:28] I've sat also as an elder in the
[1:14:30] churches and listen to men preach. And
[1:14:33] we've come to the realization that we
[1:14:35] have come as a body of people to such a
[1:14:38] time as this. God raised up this
[1:14:41] congregation to send a word around the
[1:14:44] world and you have given of your tithes
[1:14:46] and of your offerings. And I want to say
[1:14:49] we have tried to be and before God true
[1:14:52] stewards of what God has given to us.
[1:14:56] We've sent people out. We've sent
[1:14:57] ministers out. someone that probably
[1:15:00] would be a surprise to you, but brother
[1:15:01] Dominic Sangamina, who we married here,
[1:15:05] uh I didn't find out after he'd been
[1:15:07] here about a couple of years, came into
[1:15:10] my office one day and let informed me
[1:15:12] that he had actually started a couple
[1:15:14] churches over in Africa and Kenya and
[1:15:16] Tanzania. Came originally from Uganda.
[1:15:20] He has been out on a on a ministry
[1:15:23] mission. He'd been asked to go and
[1:15:25] minister at different places. He's been
[1:15:27] in Sarnia, Ottawa, Lexington, Kentucky,
[1:15:30] Georgetown, Kentucky, Quebec, and right
[1:15:33] today, this Sunday, he's speaking at
[1:15:35] Danny Fars in Manitoba. And he is uh he
[1:15:39] he sat up there for a long time. Now, he
[1:15:42] sits with his wife at at the back,
[1:15:44] Sister Astrid, and uh and he just came,
[1:15:48] but had such honor and respect. came in
[1:15:50] came into my study and said he'd been
[1:15:52] asked to go and to speak and he would be
[1:15:55] taking this trip and uh it didn't ask
[1:15:57] for any assistance or anything just
[1:15:59] going to take this trip and go out and
[1:16:01] minister been sitting here quietly
[1:16:03] amongst you and I know probably 99% of
[1:16:06] you didn't even know he would stand
[1:16:08] behind the pulpit and preach.
[1:16:12] Amen.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; I want to hear
[1:16:17] and I'm sure you want to hear
[1:16:20] what Jesus said to the woman
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; who gave the oil to pour over his feet.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; And it always has moved me. She was a
[1:16:29] nobody
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; as far as the people. She wasn't one of
[1:16:32] the disciples. She not even called one
[1:16:35] of the great women of the Bible. But
[1:16:37] Jesus said great words about her. She
[1:16:40] hath done what she could.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to lift your hand and
[1:16:48] say, "I want to join. I want to join. I
[1:16:50] want to hear that."
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; She have done what she could.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; You'll influence somebody.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to you and listen very
[1:16:59] closely. I don't care what the state of
[1:17:01] your what the state of your life is. You
[1:17:04] have come to this kingdom at such a time
[1:17:07] as this. This civilization is fading
[1:17:10] away. This civilization is going to
[1:17:13] dust.
[1:17:14] [Applause]
[1:17:17] [Music]
[1:17:28] I want to refer to because of the
[1:17:30] shortness of time.
[1:17:34] Even before there were Jews,
[1:17:37] even before there were Jews, we see the
[1:17:40] elect of God
[1:17:43] riding in on the waves of humanity
[1:17:47] and cresting everyone.
[1:17:50] Does that phrase sound familiar?
[1:17:53] There will be trials. There will be all
[1:17:55] kinds of things that will happen to you
[1:17:59] in your lifetime to try to take you
[1:18:02] down.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; And you may crest a wave and you may go
[1:18:05] down with the wave,
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; but you are a spiritual Jew and you will
[1:18:09] bob back up
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; and you'll crest the next wave
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; and you might just be riding the wave of
[1:18:20] humanity.
[1:18:21] If the country prospers, you may
[1:18:24] prosper. If the country goes into a
[1:18:26] decline, you will go into a decline. If
[1:18:29] the country goes bankrupt, you possibly
[1:18:32] go bankrupt with it. We don't know and
[1:18:35] we don't care.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; It's all in God's hands. But one thing
[1:18:41] is certain, we will bob back up
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; out of the bottom end of it.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Before there was a Jew, there was a
[1:18:50] Noah. who would be used as a time and
[1:18:53] Noah was at a time when they planted and
[1:18:56] they builded and they married and they
[1:18:59] were given and marry and they lived in
[1:19:01] hilarity and they had a great time. It
[1:19:04] was more than the roaring 20s.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; The prophet said it was a society and a
[1:19:09] civilization far advanced over ours.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; We can't build pyramids. They did.
[1:19:16] We don't know how to embomb people to
[1:19:18] last thousands of years, but they did.
[1:19:21] We don't know how to have ink and color
[1:19:23] uh that will last for thousands of
[1:19:25] years, but they did. He said it was a
[1:19:27] civilization far beyond ours, Noah's
[1:19:31] time, and that civilization sunk.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; And he rode in an ark on top of that
[1:19:40] sinking. He was part of that sinking,
[1:19:43] but he bugged back up.
[1:19:48] and he washed onto the shores of a new
[1:19:50] world
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; until the Lord Jesus himself would say,
[1:19:56] "As it was in the days of Noah, so shall
[1:19:59] it be in this time."
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you and announcing to you,
[1:20:07] this generation is sinking,
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; but we will bob back up.
[1:20:15] Glory to God.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; When we see this immorality,
[1:20:20] don't you assign your young people or
[1:20:22] your children to it or your families. We
[1:20:24] shall overcome.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; That's not just Martin Luther's song.
[1:20:31] That's our song.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; We shall overcome.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; And to them that overcame, says it, to
[1:20:37] all the church ages. Seven church ages.
[1:20:40] To them that overcame. to them that
[1:20:43] overcame and in Leo Deceia there's a
[1:20:45] people that overcome and I say to you on
[1:20:48] a public declaration by God's grace I am
[1:20:52] in that number
[1:20:55] and you want to say I am in that number
[1:20:57] and if you can't say that where are you
[1:21:01] are you going down in this in the in the
[1:21:05] dash and ashes of this civilization
[1:21:07] young people young men young ladies
[1:21:10] think about it think about it.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Where are you going?
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Where are you headed?
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; You want to turn it around today?
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; While the minister is speaking,
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; I don't care who's speaking behind the
[1:21:25] pulpit. We're coming into some meetings,
[1:21:27] but don't wait for those meetings. I'm
[1:21:29] speaking today by the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Directed right to you.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Noah wasn't a Jew, but he was an elect
[1:21:40] of God. Amen.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; There were no Jews yet.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; There were no Hebrews yet, but he was an
[1:21:46] elect of God.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; You may not be born a Jew, but we are an
[1:21:51] elect of God.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Placed here in this time, at such a
[1:21:56] season as this.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Oh my people,
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; listen closely to these words.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; But Noah
[1:22:12] found grace
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; in the sight of God in the eyes of the
[1:22:16] Lord.
[1:22:18] And when Jesus Christ, the son of man,
[1:22:21] whom dwelleth all the fullness of the
[1:22:23] Godhead bodily. Colossians 2:9,
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; he spake of this time that you and I are
[1:22:28] in.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; He spake of this hour. And he said as it
[1:22:32] was in the days of Noah and this is what
[1:22:34] he lived in. They eat and they drank.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; We are living in that time.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Go to any restaurant. Go to any place.
[1:22:41] We walked out of one yesterday.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; This is too vile.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; These girls are too unclean.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; They're just too naked.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; And we resist it.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; And my wife says, "This makes me sick."
[1:22:56] I said, "We'll leave here."
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; And we told the girls, "Forget the
[1:22:59] reservation. and we're walking out.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:04] [Applause]
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; That's this nation. That's not one
[1:23:09] place. That's every place.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; You have to look for a place
[1:23:15] that has any wholesome wholesomeness to
[1:23:18] it
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; in God's provided way. He said, "What
[1:23:23] kind of a world were they having?"
[1:23:26] speaking of Noah's time,
[1:23:29] eating, drinking, marrying, giving in
[1:23:31] marriage, all kinds of different things
[1:23:33] just as they're doing now.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; He said they had a civilization even was
[1:23:39] greater than what we've got now.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; You know something, folks? You've heard
[1:23:44] me say this before and it's kind of
[1:23:46] humorous perhaps, but really it's not
[1:23:49] humorous. I don't have a coin in my
[1:23:51] pocket,
[1:23:53] but you if you have any coins in your
[1:23:55] pocket, I guarantee you they're just pot
[1:23:57] metal.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Worthless pot metal. That's
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; I could take you home and at least I had
[1:24:06] enough cents to save some silver ones.
[1:24:09] Silver.
[1:24:11] 99.99%
[1:24:14] silver. That's what we had. We didn't
[1:24:16] realize it. We didn't think it was
[1:24:18] anything. We just had silver and the
[1:24:20] dollar was worth something and the coin
[1:24:22] was worth something and but today it's
[1:24:24] it's all Canada's just done away with
[1:24:28] their pennies cuz it cost them 2 point
[1:24:30] some cents to make a penny
[1:24:34] and the penny isn't even got any copper
[1:24:36] in it.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; They used to call them coppers. They're
[1:24:39] not coppers. This is some pot metal. And
[1:24:42] so they quit making them
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; here a few days ago.
[1:24:47] Anyway,
[1:24:52] but he says, "But in the midst," he
[1:24:54] said, "they produced the pyramid and
[1:24:56] they built this and the sphinx and the
[1:24:58] mummies and the Egyptian mummies and the
[1:25:00] embalming and all of these things and in
[1:25:03] the great coming revival and the
[1:25:06] outpouring of the Holy Ghost message."
[1:25:08] He spoke. He said, "I see the signs of
[1:25:11] destruction hanging everywhere." says,
[1:25:13] "We're in the midst of it all."
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; And this great civilization we have here
[1:25:19] is what he said. This great civilization
[1:25:21] we have here,
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; I see the destruction hanging
[1:25:25] everywhere.
[1:25:26] That's
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:25:34] Well, if Noah rode the waves of
[1:25:36] destruction and judgment coming onto the
[1:25:39] shores of a new world, Jesus said, "As
[1:25:42] it was in the days of Noah." And that'll
[1:25:44] be as it was in the days of the
[1:25:45] revealing of the son of man. I so I just
[1:25:48] say to you, not in not to be harsh or
[1:25:50] not to be but to be very direct. What
[1:25:53] has the revealing of the son of man done
[1:25:54] to you?
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing. The revealing
[1:25:59] of him is the difference between washing
[1:26:02] on the shores of a new world or or
[1:26:04] perishing in the judgment of the old.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Take your choice.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; That is the choice. There is no other
[1:26:11] choice. It has nothing to do with going
[1:26:13] to church.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Going to church is only feeding that
[1:26:18] that life that you have received. Amen.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And then the scripture tells us
[1:26:32] the disciple preaching, the apostle
[1:26:34] preaching in Acts, you are the children
[1:26:36] of the prophets and of the covenant
[1:26:38] which God made with our fathers, saying
[1:26:40] unto Abraham, and in thy seed shall all
[1:26:43] the kindreds of the earth be blessed.
[1:26:46] The Jew has blessed all the kindreds of
[1:26:49] the world.
[1:26:50] He said, "Art, art thou art not thou our
[1:26:54] God?" This is in Chronicles. "Who did
[1:26:56] drive out the inhabitants of this land
[1:26:58] before thy people Israel, and gavest to
[1:27:01] the seed of Abraham thy friend?" And
[1:27:04] Isaiah said, "But thou, Israel, art my
[1:27:06] covenant." Jacob whom I have chosen, a
[1:27:10] seed of Abraham, my friend. Although
[1:27:13] they were his children and the friend of
[1:27:16] God, they went into terrible bondage.
[1:27:18] They went into terrible uh calamities
[1:27:21] and catastrophes and they were they were
[1:27:25] at the time of the Inquisition and
[1:27:28] they'd been slaughtered and in the time
[1:27:30] of Esther and Mori the whole nation was
[1:27:33] to be everybody in the nation was to
[1:27:35] take up arm and kill the Jews in one
[1:27:38] day.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Mark that day and Hmon went his way and
[1:27:43] Mori and Esther went their way and they
[1:27:46] were victorious.
[1:27:49] But yet God did allow them to suffer
[1:27:52] incredible things.
[1:27:58] Daniel,
[1:28:00] I'm just taking a moment here because
[1:28:01] I'm skipping quite a bit. Daniel was a
[1:28:04] Jewish captive in Babylon.
[1:28:07] And he interprets the king
[1:28:09] Nebuchadnezzar's dream.
[1:28:12] It was a head of gold and a breast and
[1:28:13] arms of silver and a belly and thighs of
[1:28:16] brass and legs of iron with feet of iron
[1:28:20] and clay. Don't look lost in history.
[1:28:24] You're in the iron and clay.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Daniel was in the head of gold and
[1:28:30] you're in the toes.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God declared it.
[1:28:35] Daniel a prophet spoke it, interpreted
[1:28:38] it. And we have to recognize where we
[1:28:41] are. But as he was called to be there at
[1:28:45] such a time as that, Esther and Mori at
[1:28:49] such a time as that, I'm saying thus
[1:28:51] sayith the Lord. You're here for such a
[1:28:54] time as this.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. The truth.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; God has not made a mistake bringing you
[1:29:00] here. And your heart needs to be
[1:29:03] stirred. Your soul needs to be moved.
[1:29:05] And you need to have a confession out of
[1:29:07] your mouth. I am here by design.
[1:29:11] I am here by the design of the almighty
[1:29:13] God. And I will not let conditions of
[1:29:16] this world, I will not let the influence
[1:29:18] of the world, I won't let anything
[1:29:20] adulterate that design and that that
[1:29:23] desire that I have.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Young people, say amen.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Say it again.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Say it till you believe it.
[1:29:42] Daniel lived during the reign of the
[1:29:45] head of gold and he saw all the
[1:29:48] civilizations of the gentile world.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; These were not Jewish world. This was a
[1:29:53] Jewish civilizations. These were gentile
[1:29:56] civilizations
[1:29:58] which Max Diamont the historian which I
[1:30:01] just quoted from a wee bit. He he gave
[1:30:04] he gave a history of those civilizations
[1:30:07] and their demise and washed out and none
[1:30:10] of them came back.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you another person by the
[1:30:16] name of William Brandham who spoke on
[1:30:18] these great denominations and once they
[1:30:21] denominated they died he said and they
[1:30:23] never come back.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yes.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; And this prophet
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; saw thousands of visions.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Thousands of visions.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Not one of them failed.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; And he saw a vision of the bride.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; And he saw them in their dress. He saw
[1:30:46] them how they were clothed. He saw their
[1:30:48] hair. He looked in their eyes.
[1:30:52] And they were looking at him as they
[1:30:54] passed by.
[1:30:56] Why? because he was the messenger who
[1:30:58] brought them the voice.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; They were looking at him. He was the
[1:31:06] source of that word.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; He was the instrument that spoke that
[1:31:12] word.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; And as they passed by, they looked at
[1:31:16] him. And then they went off the scene
[1:31:19] and he sees another group. And the voice
[1:31:21] says to him, "Now you'll see the
[1:31:23] church." And he left and sees the church
[1:31:26] coming. Oh, he said it was so so
[1:31:30] disheartening. He said his heart wept.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; And he said they were barely clothed.
[1:31:36] Probably about what we saw in a
[1:31:38] restaurant yesterday.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; And I don't have themselves covered.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; And he said they had something like this
[1:31:45] like almost like a a a newspaper type of
[1:31:48] skirt and and naked. And I won't
[1:31:52] describe it. And he said he couldn't
[1:31:53] describe it over the pullpit. I won't
[1:31:56] try to describe it.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; It made him sick at heart.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; He wept. Oh God, is this what we have
[1:32:04] produced?
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; After all of his preaching, is this what
[1:32:08] we've produced?
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; And they passed by. And he says,
[1:32:13] "Furthermore,
[1:32:14] they as they heard a ter awful sound as
[1:32:18] they went down and down and he heard the
[1:32:22] sound of this place." Friends,
[1:32:25] [Music]
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; you do not want to go there.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; That's why I say with all the strength
[1:32:32] that's in me, this cannot merely be a
[1:32:35] church.
[1:32:37] We're not here just with a few revived
[1:32:39] doctrines brought by a great man man of
[1:32:42] God called William Brandom. We He had to
[1:32:45] be an instrument of the almighty God who
[1:32:49] spoke his own thoughts through that
[1:32:52] vessel.
[1:32:54] [Music]
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Are you prepared to say amen to that?
[1:32:59] Yes, sir. and he saw the church come by
[1:33:03] and it was such a such a disheartening.
[1:33:06] He saw it friends.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; This is as clear a vision as any other
[1:33:10] vision.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; And the people went by and went down and
[1:33:15] he was in that state his head and he was
[1:33:18] like feeling ashamed
[1:33:20] and he said, "You'll see the bride
[1:33:24] again."
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And there was a phrase that
[1:33:30] blessed my soul yesterday. He said, "The
[1:33:33] bride came back."
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; She didn't go down with the other crew.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; They went down down into the abyss of
[1:33:46] darkness like the civilizations they
[1:33:49] lived in.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; They lived in the glamour and the glory
[1:33:53] of those civilizations.
[1:33:55] this civilization of nothing but
[1:33:57] entertainment and Hollywood and fashion
[1:34:00] and beauty and all of this nonsense.
[1:34:02] It's going down into the ashes of hell
[1:34:05] itself.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; But the bride came back.
[1:34:13] Oh God. Oh God. Let me be in that
[1:34:17] number. Let me be in that number. Don't
[1:34:21] ever forget this. Whatever you do after
[1:34:23] this service, if you miss it, you'll not
[1:34:25] be able to blame me. It'll be your own
[1:34:28] blood on your own hands. Whatever you
[1:34:31] do, don't miss that.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; The bride came back. Noah came back.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Moses was a headed for the Pharaoh.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; He would have been a Pharaoh of the
[1:34:46] land. Being the daughter of of Pharaoh's
[1:34:50] sister, he was headed for the throne. He
[1:34:54] was headed for a throne, not the
[1:34:56] presidency of the United States,
[1:34:58] absolute monarchy,
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; of the greatest superpower of the earth,
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; that had many of the things we can't
[1:35:06] even think of making.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; We haven't got the intelligence. Are you
[1:35:11] listening to me, folks?
[1:35:13] You think America's great, Canada's
[1:35:16] great, it isn't even in the It's not
[1:35:19] even peanuts
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; compared to Egypt.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Egypt truly was a great Egypt isn't what
[1:35:25] Egypt is today. Egypt was a very great
[1:35:28] nation.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Control a big part of the earth.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, they had magicians that could do all
[1:35:35] kinds of things. Make rods go into
[1:35:37] snakes.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; How? I don't know.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; The Bible said they did.
[1:35:42] They did all kinds of things and they
[1:35:45] had wisdom and wise men of those times.
[1:35:49] We're not even in that class. Don't even
[1:35:51] think of it. It's a plastic tin
[1:35:53] generation.
[1:35:56] [Applause]
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; This a pot metal age.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; There's nothing genuine.
[1:36:04] Amen.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Even the clothes you wear some if it
[1:36:07] wasn't for some chemicals to put
[1:36:09] together to put the thread together.
[1:36:11] Perhaps hardly any of us wearing a true
[1:36:13] linen.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; And the linen of Egypt, I even read
[1:36:17] where the linen of Egypt was of greater
[1:36:20] value than an ounce of gold.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; It was such beautiful cloth. And I have
[1:36:27] seen some of it. I've seen the our
[1:36:29] people and the and the clothing and the
[1:36:32] flowing of those garments. We don't have
[1:36:34] nothing like that. The stuff you have in
[1:36:36] the malls is just junk.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Absolute garbage.
[1:36:40] [Applause]
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Excuse me, but I'm letting it all out
[1:36:44] today. This civilization is headed for a
[1:36:48] demise and we're in the midst of it. But
[1:36:51] the believers of this message are going
[1:36:53] to bob back up.
[1:36:58] I can declare that to you because a
[1:37:00] prophet who I believe in saw that happen
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; and because he saw it I say I want to be
[1:37:07] in that number. I got my eyes on that
[1:37:10] group of people.
[1:37:13] [Applause]
[1:37:21] Moses,
[1:37:23] one of the Hebrews,
[1:37:27] went from the throne to a sheep herder.
[1:37:31] Went from the royal robes to the
[1:37:34] stinking robes of you got to be willing
[1:37:37] to do it all.
[1:37:41] We've been looking back over a few years
[1:37:43] of this church.
[1:37:45] You're sitting on nice pews. I was the
[1:37:49] president of a company. But I felt that
[1:37:51] God was sweeping amongst the young
[1:37:54] people.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; And they're searching for reality. And I
[1:37:58] knew in my heart that I had that
[1:37:59] reality. I knew I had what they were
[1:38:02] searching for.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; What they were taking drugs for. Their
[1:38:06] drugs didn't bother me. They're they're
[1:38:08] trying to find some reality or trying to
[1:38:10] escape what the world said was reality.
[1:38:14] And I don't blame them for that.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; People drink themselves into oblivion.
[1:38:22] They're trying to escape the world that
[1:38:24] they're in. And you can't really blame
[1:38:27] them for that.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; But there is a reality.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; There is something that's true. Yes,
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; you're sitting on nice seats. But this
[1:38:37] man you see standing here and a few
[1:38:39] others in this congregation walked into
[1:38:42] a house which you'll see uh next Sunday.
[1:38:44] Just a quick shots of it and sat on
[1:38:47] rough unplained planks, just planks
[1:38:50] sitting on blocks of wood. Why is that
[1:38:53] all you could afford? No, but that's
[1:38:54] what we had to put together. Cuz the
[1:38:56] young people wanted to come in
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; and they did.
[1:39:03] And God's spirit, we didn't have to go
[1:39:05] out and invite them that God's spirit
[1:39:07] moved on them.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; One of them was so drunk when he walked
[1:39:10] up to the hedge of the house, he
[1:39:12] collapsed and fell over the hedge.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; About tall as you, David, about 6'5,
[1:39:17] 6'6.
[1:39:19] He just fell over the hedge.
[1:39:22] And he was want to speak to my daughter
[1:39:24] Marilyn and and and and
[1:39:27] try and, you know, make her embarrassed
[1:39:29] over something. And I said, "Invite him
[1:39:31] to church. invite him to come to the
[1:39:33] meeting
[1:39:35] and he didn't want to come. And I said,
[1:39:38] "You look up into his face and you tell
[1:39:40] him you're a chicken."
[1:39:42] That's what I preach to the girls at
[1:39:44] home. You tell them you're a chicken. If
[1:39:46] you don't, don't talk to me about, you
[1:39:48] know, what you're trying to get me to do
[1:39:50] to take your drugs and stuff. You come
[1:39:52] to church and if you don't, you're a
[1:39:53] chicken.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; And so he was standing outside of the
[1:39:57] house because he felt like he was a
[1:39:59] chicken. He had to prove he wasn't a
[1:40:00] chicken. and he fell right over the
[1:40:03] hedge klunk. That's how drunk he was.
[1:40:06] That didn't mean nothing to us. He came
[1:40:08] in and got saved
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; and got delivered
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; and found really what he was looking
[1:40:15] for.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. Glory to God. This is
[1:40:20] the same God.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; And I don't care whether it's a hippie
[1:40:24] movement or some other movement.
[1:40:26] civilization just waves and waves and
[1:40:28] waves and then some of the great
[1:40:30] civilizations and this one is the
[1:40:32] prophet of God has said it. I believe it
[1:40:35] and I have seen it witnessed in my own
[1:40:38] life. It's going down the tube.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; It's going it's in the demise. You young
[1:40:44] people, you live to see it and someday
[1:40:45] you'll remember what brother Biscott's
[1:40:47] preaching to you today. You shall see
[1:40:51] the demise of it.
[1:40:54] Amen.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; And then you remember this word and
[1:40:59] you'll remember what a prophet of God
[1:41:00] has said. But I'm showing you from the
[1:41:03] scripture that the believer for the word
[1:41:06] of God
[1:41:08] is eternal.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth shall pass away, but
[1:41:13] my word shall never pass away.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; And if you take that word into the womb
[1:41:18] of your mind and down into your soul,
[1:41:20] you shall never pass away. Hallelujah.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; The civilization may demise, but you
[1:41:26] shall bob back up.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Where's Egypt today?
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; They just had riots over there.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Their president had to flee and in his
[1:41:38] 80s they're they're taking him to court
[1:41:40] for cruelty to humanity.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Mubarak.
[1:41:46] What's it all about? It's total chaos
[1:41:49] over there.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; So filthy you don't want to go over
[1:41:51] there. That was a great nation
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; at one time.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; A great nation. Where are they? And
[1:41:59] where's Pharaoh? He went down.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; He's gone into the sands and of
[1:42:04] oblivion. Where's Moses? He was on Mount
[1:42:07] Transfiguration.
[1:42:08] He bought back up.
[1:42:12] He came back up.
[1:42:16] Elijah the prophet lived under the most
[1:42:18] wicked reign, the most wicked president,
[1:42:21] the most wicked prime minister, whatever
[1:42:23] you want to call him. The title doesn't
[1:42:25] mean anything, but he lived under the
[1:42:27] most wicked of people.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Ahab. Where's Ahab? I don't know. But
[1:42:34] Elijah came back.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Elijah was there with Jesus
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; on Mount Transfiguration.
[1:42:43] He bobbed back up.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And the prophet
[1:42:48] of God saw the church world go down. But
[1:42:51] he saw the bride come back again.
[1:42:55] Said the bride came back.
[1:42:59] Oh, hallelujah. The bride came back.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Nothing's going to hold her down.
[1:43:07] I don't care what this system around us,
[1:43:09] what they do. If they even cast us into
[1:43:11] prison,
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; so be it.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; But the bride will come back.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Destroy this body, Jesus said. Destroy
[1:43:23] this body. He knew he was going to bob
[1:43:26] back up.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; I don't mean to be disrespectful of the
[1:43:29] resurrection, but nothing could keep him
[1:43:32] in that tomb. For he had that word
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; that it flesh shall not see corruption.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; And it was because he believed that word
[1:43:43] he raised his own body back up.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "You can do
[1:43:48] that."
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we believe a word that is
[1:43:51] not meant for the grave.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; We have a life that's meant for the sky.
[1:44:00] [Applause]
[1:44:04] You think God is going to allow this in
[1:44:06] flesh to go into a grave
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; and sit in the grave?
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Not on your life.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We weren't meant for the
[1:44:15] grave. As the songwriter said in the it
[1:44:18] is well with my soul. The grave is not
[1:44:21] our goal. The sky.
[1:44:27] [Music]
[1:44:32] Hallelujah.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; When Daniel saw these
[1:44:38] civilizations and maybe don't don't lose
[1:44:42] the inspiration, please.
[1:44:43] when he lived and saw these in he saw
[1:44:46] these
[1:44:47] uh the interpretation he received the
[1:44:50] interpretation
[1:44:52] and brother Brandham Gibbs and I have
[1:44:54] taken time to abbreviate it for you in
[1:44:57] the Pergamian church age
[1:45:00] quickly and I'm just going to read
[1:45:02] little segments please and he says thus
[1:45:05] by the time the third church age we have
[1:45:08] two churches
[1:45:10] bearing the same name
[1:45:13] but with but with a bitter difference
[1:45:16] between them.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; One is departed from the truth,
[1:45:22] married idols, and has no life in her
[1:45:26] church.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; She is powerful with many members.
[1:45:32] She is favored by the world and the
[1:45:35] other is a little persecuted group. Now
[1:45:38] watch this, please.
[1:45:40] But she follows the word
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; and the signs follow her.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; The sick are healed and the dead are
[1:45:47] raised.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; She is alive with the life of the word
[1:45:50] of God.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; And she loves not her life but holds her
[1:45:54] holds his name and his faith unto the
[1:45:57] death.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Those are two groups.
[1:46:00] Terrible persecution of official Rome
[1:46:04] fell upon the true believers until
[1:46:07] Constantine arose and granted freedom of
[1:46:11] spiritual worship.
[1:46:14] These were persecuted little group. Now
[1:46:16] watch
[1:46:19] a persecuted little group and at even to
[1:46:23] the risk of death and they were thrown
[1:46:25] into jungle into jails and into prisons
[1:46:29] and before animals and finally a leader
[1:46:32] arises and says you know it's okay I'm
[1:46:35] going to give you freedom of worship.
[1:46:39] Constantine
[1:46:41] had a very different very difficult
[1:46:44] battle ahead of him.
[1:46:46] So he was a military man
[1:46:49] in taking over the control of the
[1:46:51] empire. So now his desire was to take
[1:46:54] over the control of the empire. That's
[1:46:56] why he gave freedom of worship to these
[1:46:58] people to gain their favor.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; What they thought was a blessing from
[1:47:03] God
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; was actually a trap.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; You have freedom of worship.
[1:47:17] I don't mean to be nasty,
[1:47:20] but I will tell you in places where they
[1:47:22] are under oppression,
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; they appreciate being able to get
[1:47:27] together more than we do.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; I was so humbled
[1:47:40] and not long ago,
[1:47:43] just a few years ago, China has opened
[1:47:46] up. But when China was real restricted
[1:47:48] and Sister Tracy knows about that,
[1:47:52] and they come in,
[1:47:55] little knock on the door, someone goes
[1:47:56] and looks through the peepphole, opens
[1:47:59] the door, and a couple people walk in.
[1:48:01] They sit down, quiet,
[1:48:05] knock on the door, go to the door, look
[1:48:07] at the people. Another one walks in and
[1:48:10] then finally gathers 20, 30 people. And
[1:48:12] when they come in, they have to go over
[1:48:14] to a closet and they take out the
[1:48:16] chairs, little plastic children's
[1:48:18] chairs, little ones like this. And and
[1:48:21] because they're stacked because they can
[1:48:22] put them away quickly. I see Sister
[1:48:25] Tracy nodding her head. That's exactly
[1:48:27] right. And take those chairs out and set
[1:48:29] those chairs
[1:48:31] like that
[1:48:33] and then they sit on those little chairs
[1:48:35] like this and look up at you. I can see
[1:48:39] some of them are in business suits.
[1:48:42] The day we were arrested, the woman that
[1:48:44] was right in front of me
[1:48:47] who wanted didn't service the next night
[1:48:49] and asked if I would speak on the
[1:48:51] rapture.
[1:48:53] The policeman that arrested me months
[1:48:56] later wrote and said the reason he was
[1:48:59] so disheartened at having to go in and
[1:49:02] do that arrest said because his
[1:49:06] grandmother and this took him months to
[1:49:08] get out. His grandmother took him to a
[1:49:11] house meeting when he was a boy 8 years
[1:49:13] old and he said they were such nice
[1:49:16] people and they called each other
[1:49:18] brother and sister and their leader was
[1:49:20] a very kind man. He just put it in his
[1:49:23] words, not religious words, but his
[1:49:25] words. And he says, "And when I came
[1:49:27] into the room, about 25 police with the
[1:49:30] cameras and everything. And when I came
[1:49:32] into the room, he says, "The lady right
[1:49:35] in front of you was my son's
[1:49:39] kindergarten teacher."
[1:49:42] And there was a teacher.
[1:49:44] You sisters here are teachers. You
[1:49:46] brothers are teachers. and they're
[1:49:47] sitting on a little plastic stool
[1:49:50] listening to words they had not heard
[1:49:53] before. They're mouth so eager. Would
[1:49:56] you speak on the rapture tomorrow night?
[1:49:58] Please stay over one more night.
[1:50:04] I don't hear that here. Do you know why?
[1:50:07] We got freedom.
[1:50:09] We know we're going to have a service
[1:50:10] next Wednesday. We're going to have a
[1:50:12] service tonight. Brother Tom's going to
[1:50:14] preach. Brother John's going to preach.
[1:50:18] That's a trap.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; That doesn't do us any good.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; What does the prophet spoke of? Rugged.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Don't care. Rugged.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; At the expense, I'll believe here. I'll
[1:50:36] be here tonight.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll be here tonight because
[1:50:40] of rugged.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; This lacks of days called an easy thing.
[1:50:44] easy life to say what's a great life I
[1:50:46] came here to announce to you this great
[1:50:48] life
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; and the prophet said that you're so
[1:50:51] you're so attached to
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; it
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; is going down in death
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; what can we do well I I would say it
[1:51:01] it's not enough to talk about the
[1:51:02] negative side what can we do positively
[1:51:04] I would say the positive thing is number
[1:51:06] one give yourself unreservedly
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; to the spirit of God and yield yourself
[1:51:12] unreservedly and say Father, let thy
[1:51:15] will be achieved in my life.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Don't slide along with this age.
[1:51:25] [Music]
[1:51:35] I trust. I pray.
[1:51:38] I have daily examined my life
[1:51:43] daily.
[1:51:44] Do you know why?
[1:51:48] I want him to be pleased.
[1:51:51] I want somehow him to be pleased.
[1:51:56] Once in a while I get to go hunting and
[1:51:59] when I go through the woods or ride the
[1:52:02] quad,
[1:52:04] I ride my quad. You think, "Oh, that's
[1:52:05] so much fun. You just ride your quad." I
[1:52:08] ride that quad. I just let it putt putt
[1:52:11] along.
[1:52:12] I say, "Father,
[1:52:16] all I really want to know,
[1:52:19] I just want to know if you're pleased.
[1:52:23] I want to know if what I'm doing is
[1:52:25] pleasing to you.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; If I see something, that's fine. If I
[1:52:30] don't, that's fine. I'm just out there.
[1:52:32] I want to talk to him
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; that made all of that.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; I want to feel connected. I want to know
[1:52:40] he's hearing me.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Is my life pleasing to you?
[1:52:47] If you can't do anything further,
[1:52:51] you can do that.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; That's in everybody's reach.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; It's in everybody's reach. That's in
[1:53:01] your boy's reach.
[1:53:04] Father,
[1:53:06] is my life pleasing to you?
[1:53:17] I want to be in that number.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; I want to be in that group.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; And I want to still be looking at that
[1:53:24] messenger
[1:53:26] that that source where that word came
[1:53:28] from. I want to be saying it as he said
[1:53:30] it.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; I want to be be believing it as he
[1:53:33] believed it.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Let me just close.
[1:53:46] So, here's these two churches. Here's
[1:53:47] these two groups. Here's one, the
[1:53:49] persecuted little group. And I thought I
[1:53:52] would just throw in that what really is
[1:53:54] liberty and what is not.
[1:54:00] And he says one night in a dream, and
[1:54:02] brother Brown talks about this often,
[1:54:04] one night in a dream, he sees a white
[1:54:06] cross
[1:54:08] appear before him. And he felt that this
[1:54:09] was an omen unto him that if the
[1:54:12] Christians prayed for victory for him,
[1:54:16] he would win the battle. He promised
[1:54:18] freedom for them in the event that he
[1:54:20] was victorious. He was victorious and
[1:54:23] the freedom of worship was granted.
[1:54:26] The whole thing is the wrong
[1:54:30] it's the wrong basis.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; He wanted to win a victory. He got the
[1:54:35] people to pray. They won the victory and
[1:54:37] the people got freedom.
[1:54:40] And you had brother brother Timothy Maw
[1:54:43] here the other day and when he referred
[1:54:45] to freedom he said evil.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; I mentioned it here. I'll just mention
[1:54:56] it again. I was living and I saw the
[1:54:58] paper and I read the article
[1:55:02] when President Krushche,
[1:55:05] the one who hammered his shoe down, what
[1:55:08] the prophet spoke about, hammered his
[1:55:10] shoe down
[1:55:13] at the United Nations and brother Brown
[1:55:15] made a significance out of that
[1:55:18] and the president of America wanted to
[1:55:20] take him why why would they take him to
[1:55:22] a can can dance where all the can can
[1:55:25] ladies are dancing and swinging. their
[1:55:27] naked legs way up in the air. Oh, this a
[1:55:31] land of America is a land of freedom.
[1:55:34] Look where freedom took them.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; And a godless which prophet said a
[1:55:37] godless nation whose god was science had
[1:55:40] to chastise and rebuke
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; the head the leader of the land of
[1:55:44] freedom
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; because freedom took him to corruption
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; and to immorality and into death.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; And that's the way it is.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; That just happens to be the way it is.
[1:55:55] And the scripture says, your Bible, if
[1:55:57] you care to look at it, your Bible says,
[1:55:59] "It shall wax worse and
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; worse."
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Say it again.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Worse.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Don't forget that. It shall wax worse
[1:56:07] and worse.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; We're coming to 40th year. And I'm sure
[1:56:20] Brother Ken Ardel won't mind me saying
[1:56:22] this.
[1:56:24] just after he gave his life to Christ.
[1:56:27] And he was the organist, organ player
[1:56:30] across the street at the United Church.
[1:56:35] And my neighbor,
[1:56:37] the woman, the house of my neighbor
[1:56:40] where I was living
[1:56:42] was the choir leader.
[1:56:46] And I'm not using any names other than
[1:56:48] Brother Ken's.
[1:56:51] And she was an alcoholic.
[1:56:54] And on Sunday morning, he would come
[1:56:57] hung over from doing what he did the
[1:57:00] night before and maybe some dope and
[1:57:03] drugs or whatever more. Maybe nothing
[1:57:06] heavy. I don't know.
[1:57:09] And she was there with a hangover from
[1:57:12] alcoholism.
[1:57:14] And the organist
[1:57:16] is hangover from his party and the choir
[1:57:20] leader and they're singing. He's
[1:57:22] supposed to be singing worship to God.
[1:57:26] And Ken's father was dean of men at the
[1:57:29] at the church.
[1:57:33] So now I'm just relating a few early
[1:57:35] days that you won't get during the
[1:57:38] meetings. So his mother and dad came
[1:57:41] over to see me
[1:57:48] and they were troubled and they'd seen
[1:57:50] and read perhaps a little bit of the
[1:57:52] books that he had, message books,
[1:57:55] and they're very troubled because he's
[1:57:57] going to quit his education. He was
[1:57:59] heading to be a school teacher or
[1:58:01] something
[1:58:04] and he's going to quit university. He's
[1:58:05] in his second year and he's going to
[1:58:06] quit university. and it's kind of it's
[1:58:08] it's my fault and it's the message fault
[1:58:10] or whoever whatever this thing is
[1:58:14] and I said well you know you're talking
[1:58:16] to the wrong person really has nothing
[1:58:18] to do with me and I began to speak of
[1:58:21] the conditions of the world and they
[1:58:23] were getting worse and worse and God
[1:58:25] bless
[1:58:27] brother Kent has a wonderful mother
[1:58:30] wonderful mother even though his
[1:58:31] father's passed away at I think 57 years
[1:58:34] old and she has lived uh uh alone and
[1:58:39] has lived a very honorable life and
[1:58:40] she's a wonderful woman.
[1:58:43] I want to say that and she said in all
[1:58:45] sincerity because that's what she's
[1:58:47] probably told.
[1:58:49] And I said as the world is getting worse
[1:58:51] and worse and she says oh I don't think
[1:58:53] so.
[1:58:55] Oh really?
[1:58:57] I said what do you think is happening?
[1:58:59] She said I think it's getting better and
[1:59:01] better.
[1:59:03] Well I I couldn't go any further.
[1:59:06] There's the end of the road. Anyway, Ken
[1:59:09] held on to his direction and they rem
[1:59:13] remained so loyal and years later
[1:59:17] that church took the blood
[1:59:20] every song of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:59:24] and cleansed it out of their system
[1:59:27] and don't have a song about the blood.
[1:59:33] And when Linda was witnessing to him and
[1:59:37] he was trying to, you know, he was
[1:59:39] verbally much sharper than she was and
[1:59:42] was trying to debate with her about
[1:59:45] spiritual things and she just couldn't
[1:59:47] say anything anymore. She says, "Well,
[1:59:49] you need to be washed in the blood."
[1:59:51] Washed in the blood.
[1:59:54] You know how gross that sounds to some
[1:59:56] people? Washed in the blood.
[2:00:00] And that was the end of their
[2:00:01] conversation.
[2:00:03] Next thing he knew, he came to a service
[2:00:05] and the Holy Spirit, this same Holy
[2:00:07] Spirit,
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; this same God,
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; this same Christ,
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; begin to deal with him. And that night,
[2:00:14] he was changed and transformed.
[2:00:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; And I think if you were to talk to him,
[2:00:20] you'd find out the very church he walked
[2:00:22] out of
[2:00:24] has gone down is going down that very
[2:00:26] slope that the prophet, his prophet saw.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful, brother Ken, you headed a
[2:00:37] different direction
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; when that church is long gone. These
[2:00:42] denominations are long gone in the seven
[2:00:45] church ages. And what happened? What
[2:00:46] happened with civilization? As I'm
[2:00:48] closing now, what happened in
[2:00:50] civilizations is exactly what happened
[2:00:51] with the believer. There was a small
[2:00:53] elect group. They believed Martin. Small
[2:00:56] elect group believed Wesley. Small elect
[2:00:59] group believed Luther. And when they
[2:01:02] denominated and died and went down and
[2:01:05] never rose again on him, the next move
[2:01:07] of God, the next revival, here they
[2:01:10] were.
[2:01:11] The spiritual Jews bobbed up again.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Through all the seven church ages. And
[2:01:23] here you are. You're not just members of
[2:01:25] Cloverdale. By the way, that doesn't
[2:01:27] mean anything. Spiritual Jews,
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; born of God.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ordained to bob up again.
[2:01:39] Moses came back. Elijah came back.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. After all the civilizations,
[2:01:45] the Jews kept bobbing up. And here we
[2:01:47] are.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Here we are. And I want to close this
[2:01:50] service by saying you on the authority
[2:01:52] of God's word. God has ordained that you
[2:01:56] should come to the kingdom for such a
[2:01:58] time as this. God has a God has a a job
[2:02:02] description for you. God has a place for
[2:02:04] you to fill. And whatever you do, you
[2:02:07] say, "Father, thy will be done."
[2:02:10] [Applause]
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; I can talk about some very people who
[2:02:16] feel very insignificant.
[2:02:20] What's the name of the woman that washed
[2:02:22] his feet
[2:02:24] and anointed his head with oil?
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; What's her name? You don't know her
[2:02:28] name.
[2:02:31] She's not named in the Bible. But her
[2:02:34] act was
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; her act is written in the Bible. We
[2:02:38] don't have to be notifi we don't have to
[2:02:40] be noted and we don't have to be
[2:02:41] recognized and we don't have to become
[2:02:43] highly visible. God knows who we are.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; We just do what we I I can tell you a
[2:02:49] faithful a faithful sister in Christ, a
[2:02:52] faithful mother in Christ, you'll
[2:02:54] receive award. We don't receive rewards
[2:02:56] for what we achieve. We receive rewards
[2:02:59] for being faithful.
[2:03:01] And a woman that's faithful at home will
[2:03:03] receive the same reward as far as I'm
[2:03:05] concerned as a man and stand behind a
[2:03:06] pulpit. If she's faithful in her call
[2:03:09] and God called her to be here, called
[2:03:12] her to be a mother, called her to be a
[2:03:13] wife, whatever it was, called you to be
[2:03:16] young people. I challenge you in the
[2:03:18] name of Jesus Christ, you pick up the
[2:03:21] sword. You pick up this desire that you
[2:03:23] have in your heart and live it. Live it
[2:03:26] for everything that's within you.
[2:03:30] Hallelujah.
[2:03:46] Here's what he said.
[2:03:51] He saw this group and I close with this.
[2:03:55] Her eyes
[2:04:04] She was the cleanest and sweetest
[2:04:08] looking people I ever seen in my life.
[2:04:11] She passed by sweetly with an air and
[2:04:15] her eyes
[2:04:16] up
[2:04:18] watching as she passed by
[2:04:21] said she was so beautiful. I looked at
[2:04:23] her and as she passed by, he said, "Now
[2:04:26] we shall review the churches."
[2:04:30] And when they come up, each one looked
[2:04:33] like they got worse. That's what the
[2:04:36] That's what the civilization you're
[2:04:37] living in right now
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; gets worse.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; In my lifetime, it's got worse.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; There's more worse. There's more
[2:04:47] struggles. There's more war. There's
[2:04:49] more road raids. There's more uh
[2:04:52] violence.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:05:08] Is a very wicked age
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; we live in.
[2:05:14] And only the blood of Calvary
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; can keep you.
[2:05:21] And hold the Holy Spirit can hold you
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; in this day
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; because Satan has successfully
[2:05:30] infiltrated
[2:05:32] every segment of your society to
[2:05:35] infiltrate your mind.
[2:05:38] Right.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; And you'll not be successful on your own
[2:05:42] power to keep it out.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit,
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Do you have confidence in the Holy
[2:05:51] Spirit?
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Have confidence in him, friends.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; You may be burdened this morning. Have
[2:05:58] confidence in him.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And now we'll review the
[2:06:05] churches. And when they come up, each
[2:06:07] one looked like they got worse. I never
[2:06:08] seen such a filthy bunch in my life. And
[2:06:11] all of them was dressed with some kind
[2:06:13] of lower clothes down here. But he said
[2:06:16] the top was just had a strap, just about
[2:06:19] a a little about a half inch strap that
[2:06:23] moved up and went around them like this.
[2:06:26] Absolutely nothing but looked like
[2:06:29] street prostitutes.
[2:06:31] And they were singing this here. twist
[2:06:35] and roll songs and you know every what
[2:06:40] you call it going down singing. Do you
[2:06:44] understand what he saying? They were
[2:06:46] singing while they were going down.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; They're oblivious.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Tell me a church. Show me a church.
[2:07:03] Friends, this is I know a very serious
[2:07:05] service. Show me a church that doesn't
[2:07:08] think they're going to heaven
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; and they're actually singing while
[2:07:14] they're going down.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; You need to read the read the vision
[2:07:20] yourself and let it speak to you like I
[2:07:22] do.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; And it's going down and it kind of
[2:07:28] twisting. And he says, "And he asked, is
[2:07:32] that the church?"
[2:07:35] And I was standing there and in my heart
[2:07:37] I was crying and they went off to the
[2:07:41] left and disappeared into chaos,
[2:07:44] still beating this music and making real
[2:07:47] funny sounds and shaking their bodies.
[2:07:51] One side,
[2:07:54] I don't even know how they do it. I
[2:07:55] don't know whether where it came from,
[2:07:57] but whether it's
[2:07:59] And I'm I'm not timed that way. And I'm
[2:08:01] kind of glad I'm not timed that way, but
[2:08:06] perhaps some are. I see these little
[2:08:09] kids, just little kid like that, and
[2:08:11] they're just walking down the street,
[2:08:12] and they go,
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; that spirit's already on them,
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; And do they think that's wrong? No. No.
[2:08:21] And there there's mother and dad, and
[2:08:22] they're just oblivious to it,
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; and they'll get right up in the service.
[2:08:28] And this now the prophet saw this right
[2:08:30] in church.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; You know what's happening over in
[2:08:37] Christian life assembly?
[2:08:42] Langley's Got Talent.
[2:08:46] That production with celebrities and
[2:08:50] everything is happening in Langley in
[2:08:53] LCA or CLA Christian Life Assembly in
[2:08:58] Langley while you're sitting here in the
[2:09:01] next few days. Langley's Got Talent in a
[2:09:05] Pentecostal church. Right.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; I say wake up.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Don't let sleep and heaviness of eyelids
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; come upon us in this day.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; It's happening down the street.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; It's happening next to your home.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; It's happening in your shopping center.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; Where you buy clothes.
[2:09:30] And don't ever forget that the people
[2:09:32] that designed those fashions
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; are the most possessed you could ever
[2:09:37] ever imagine. I've seen them at their
[2:09:39] tables working in Los Angeles. It is
[2:09:42] unbelievable. I couldn't get out fast
[2:09:44] enough.
[2:09:49] And he says,
[2:09:53] "And I started to bow my head and he
[2:09:56] said,
[2:09:58] "Wait, the bride must come again."
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; And I looked and here they come again.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; And they passed by.
[2:10:09] Let me tell you friends, these are
[2:10:11] people who've even gone to the dust and
[2:10:13] the ashes of the earth.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; These are people who've been buried in
[2:10:17] concrete boxes.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; These are all kinds of people. These are
[2:10:21] people who lived in the midst of sin and
[2:10:22] immorality.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; And one day while they're walking down
[2:10:26] the street or walking wherever they were
[2:10:27] walking, but they had the word of God,
[2:10:30] they wear the word in flesh.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; And that word transformed them.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That word took control of
[2:10:38] the atoms of their body.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I feel such a surge of it.
[2:10:45] I just It almost seems like it happened
[2:10:47] at this moment. It just is in a moment.
[2:10:51] In a twinkling of an eye, they're
[2:10:54] transformed and start their upward
[2:10:56] movement. Friends, this isn't just a
[2:10:58] Sunday school picnic. I'm preaching
[2:11:01] wholesome word of God to you today.
[2:11:05] And if you reject this,
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; you're rejecting God's invitation.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; It's that plain and that simple.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; And we all ought to say amen as
[2:11:16] believers.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; I say that's my kind of preaching.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart and
[2:11:23] soul.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, I do.
[2:11:28] And it says, "And the church came into
[2:11:29] view once each nation, the church, but
[2:11:33] the bride came in twice
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; and then I and the seed fell in the
[2:11:38] ground at Na." That was the original
[2:11:41] seed. And she came and she's come
[2:11:44] through the process of these
[2:11:47] denominations.
[2:11:50] I rode
[2:11:52] the wave of the denominations.
[2:11:55] I was born in the Catholic or the great
[2:11:58] Catholic church.
[2:12:00] I was glad I only wrote it for about
[2:12:02] three or four years.
[2:12:05] And God in his grace got my mom and dad.
[2:12:08] They were born of the spirit of God.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; And even even at four years old,
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; I could look on them and I could tell
[2:12:18] something had happened
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; in our home. Amen.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; They couldn't explain Calvary or all
[2:12:25] these things to me. I just knew
[2:12:27] something happened.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; My mom was a different mom.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; It's still the same.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Nathan Hillbrand. Still the
[2:12:38] same.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And there isn't one of you
[2:12:41] young people that looked in the face of
[2:12:43] your godly mother and father that'll
[2:12:44] ever have an excuse.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; You'll never have an excuse. That's
[2:12:49] right.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Make your choice now. Change it now.
[2:12:52] Change your direction now.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; I knew something had happened.
[2:13:04] Then I then then you know then came
[2:13:07] Pentecost that moved in. Great waves of
[2:13:10] glory singing new kinds of song and I'm
[2:13:13] free. I'm free and all of these
[2:13:15] wonderful things. And oh we so rejoiced
[2:13:17] in it. And I've seen it go all the way
[2:13:19] from that.
[2:13:21] Langley has talent.
[2:13:24] I joined with a prophet. He's gone. I'm
[2:13:29] still here. You're still here.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; I tell you, when I hear those things,
[2:13:33] Brother Tom, Brother John, I hang my
[2:13:35] head.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; I I want to do better.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; I want to make a greater sound. Give the
[2:13:41] winds a mighty voice.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I thank God for every
[2:13:45] message book, Brother
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; Matthew. that's been distributed. And
[2:13:49] brother brother Solomon from Seattle
[2:13:51] just sent me a a text. He said, "And
[2:13:53] with all the list of the churches from
[2:13:55] Nigeria and from Ghana and from all over
[2:13:57] Africa that received 86,000 books, they
[2:14:01] handed them out. Send them over in a
[2:14:02] container. We don't make a big issue out
[2:14:04] of it, but it they were stored in
[2:14:06] India." And brother Kim Dingwall had
[2:14:08] them sent over there. Some I don't
[2:14:10] understand how everything happens. I'm
[2:14:11] just thank God it happens. Amen.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; So, we rode the wave of
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; I'm talking my own testimony now. Just
[2:14:21] bear with me. One to two minutes. I
[2:14:24] riding the wave of Pentecost.
[2:14:28] And I went down. I started going down.
[2:14:33] I was going down with it.
[2:14:39] And it came to nothing.
[2:14:43] came to finally the place where the word
[2:14:45] could come right out of a vindicated
[2:14:47] prophet's mouth and
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; they turn it away.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; And even and I I can't say everything
[2:14:53] I'd like to tell you cuz sometimes these
[2:14:56] things are happening right around you
[2:14:57] and you don't know it
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; by nice people,
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; by good people,
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; and they're denying the message you
[2:15:06] love. And Satan is working in very
[2:15:10] cunning ways to suggest doubt
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; concerning the message.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; Just trying to sew a seed of doubt.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Name it. It's a demon.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; Congregation ought to say thank you.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. Amen.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; I've even spoke to them face to face
[2:15:38] said that's a demon and had good
[2:15:41] righteous men stand say you say that's a
[2:15:44] demon. I said does God do that? Do you
[2:15:49] tell me does the Holy Ghost do what
[2:15:51] you're engaged in? Does the Holy Ghost
[2:15:53] do that?
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; And I fell silent. Listen folks, you
[2:15:59] have to come to I'm calling every one of
[2:16:02] you on the scene because you're going to
[2:16:03] hear all this again.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost doesn't do that trying to
[2:16:10] So, it's the same. You you don't don't
[2:16:12] just sit here and think we talk of
[2:16:14] history. I'm talking about right now,
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; right now. Right here.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; And when you hear that little whiff of
[2:16:21] doubt come in and they're questioning
[2:16:22] something within the word, you cast it
[2:16:24] off. You have nothing to do with it. and
[2:16:28] identify it. It doesn't come from the
[2:16:30] Holy Ghost. And there's only two powers
[2:16:32] in the earth. There's only two powers in
[2:16:34] the earth. One is God and one is Satan.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the sooner that we
[2:16:40] identify and say that's the enemy,
[2:16:42] that's the devil.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; And it looses them from you and you're
[2:16:46] free from it.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Says it came and I underline this. It
[2:16:53] came through the process of the
[2:16:55] denomination. So that was me.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; And Pentecost went down
[2:17:00] and somewhere
[2:17:03] at the bottom.
[2:17:05] I was at the bottom.
[2:17:10] Not just myself emotionally.
[2:17:13] The organization was at the bottom.
[2:17:16] Ministers could tell offcolor jokes and
[2:17:19] stories
[2:17:20] and all kinds of things going on. and to
[2:17:24] even question it or to withstand it.
[2:17:30] And because of that, I went to two
[2:17:32] churches. I went to a full gospel
[2:17:34] Pentecostal church in Vancouver Island
[2:17:36] in Victoria and left it finally because
[2:17:39] of the improprieties that were taking
[2:17:41] place. And I went to an apostolic
[2:17:43] church. I believed in the name of the
[2:17:44] Lord Jesus Christ. That God was one God.
[2:17:46] Baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:17:48] Christ
[2:17:50] and baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:17:51] Jesus Christ. believe in the infilling
[2:17:53] the Holy Spirit. When brother Brandham
[2:17:56] came there, they refused to come.
[2:18:01] Both of those churches refused to come.
[2:18:07] That's how low it got.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; But in the midst of that,
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; and I'm just giving a testimony now. In
[2:18:14] the midst of that, friends, the word
[2:18:16] came by my way. In the midst of that,
[2:18:20] the word came by my way. Hallelujah. In
[2:18:24] the midst of that, the resurrection went
[2:18:26] by. Hallelujah. And I said, that's for
[2:18:29] me.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to end this service by
[2:18:33] saying, I bobbed back up.
[2:18:37] I thank God.
[2:18:40] I thank God I'm not part of that. I
[2:18:43] thank God I'm not part of that on the
[2:18:45] platform.
[2:18:47] Langley has talent or some other place
[2:18:50] has talent. I'm glad I'm not part of
[2:18:52] that mixture of Hollywood church and all
[2:18:55] this kind of business. I thank God and
[2:18:58] people want to put it discredit this
[2:19:00] message. I thank God for this message. I
[2:19:03] thank God for this word. I thank God for
[2:19:06] the original seed, the spoken word, the
[2:19:08] original seed. I thank God for where
[2:19:11] would we be without it?
[2:19:13] That's what we're here for.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; Why don't we stand to our feet?
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; Father, our hearts, my heart is so
[2:19:29] filled with thanksgiving.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; Whether I live or die is immaterial,
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; it's irrelevant to me. God would just
[2:19:38] step over. I want to step into that
[2:19:41] vision and fulfill the other part of it.
[2:19:43] I want to walk by, oh God. I want my
[2:19:47] eyes to be fixed, oh God, on that where
[2:19:50] that source of that word came from. Lord
[2:19:53] Jesus, it's all you. It's all you.
[2:19:55] You're the designer. You're the author
[2:19:57] of all of this. And we thank you for it.
[2:20:00] I thank you, Father, for the people
[2:20:01] that's had grace to listen to me today
[2:20:04] and unburden my heart. And I just pray
[2:20:06] that somehow something has been said
[2:20:08] that will move them. Move them. Oh God,
[2:20:13] move someone. Oh father, move them in
[2:20:16] the name of Jesus Christ to making a
[2:20:19] sound declaration and a decision which
[2:20:23] will last all of their life.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; And let them not be moved by this uh
[2:20:28] fickle generation, this time that we're
[2:20:31] in. Oh God, I haven't got words to even
[2:20:34] express how empty and is. And the great
[2:20:38] great wise person Solomon could say it's
[2:20:42] vanity. Vanity. All is vanity. Give a
[2:20:46] revelation of that to the people,
[2:20:48] Father, so we can see we're in the
[2:20:50] world, but we're not of the world. We're
[2:20:53] living here. We work. We pay our bills.
[2:20:55] We have to eat. We have to have
[2:20:56] strength. We thank you for that. Is any
[2:20:59] sick among you? You're still the healer,
[2:21:01] Lord. Heal them in the name of Jesus
[2:21:03] Christ. Any here not filled with the
[2:21:05] Holy Ghost, I pray that you shall fill
[2:21:08] them, Lord. Fill them not in the
[2:21:10] meetings coming up. Fill them now,
[2:21:12] Father. Fill them to overflowing. And I
[2:21:15] can't do it. You do it, Lord. It's
[2:21:17] something that you do. Help us to sing
[2:21:19] and worship, Father. And any that may be
[2:21:21] in the valley of decision, may they make
[2:21:24] that decision like a true, courageous
[2:21:28] man or woman. Let them make that
[2:21:30] decision, Father. They can make it on
[2:21:33] their own right where they are or kneel
[2:21:36] at their chair or at their at their bans
[2:21:38] or kneel here at the altar. Whatever.
[2:21:41] We're here, oh God, to be the benefit to
[2:21:43] your people.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus.
[2:21:47] In the name of Jesus, we thank you,
[2:21:49] Father.
[2:21:51] Oh, we bless your name, oh God.
[2:21:55] Could we sing? We bless your name. We
[2:21:57] bless your name.
[2:21:59] I bless your name.
[2:22:03] [Music]
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; Let's lift it up now.
[2:22:17] [Music]
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; Give you honor.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; Give you praise.
[2:22:26] You are the life,
[2:22:31] the truth, the way.
[2:22:36] I bless your name. Let's bless his name
[2:22:40] together. God bless your name.
[2:22:45] In prisons change and prisoners change
[2:22:52] with bleeding stripes.
[2:22:56] Then Paul and Silus, Paul and Silas,
[2:23:02] pray that night.
[2:23:07] And in their pain,
[2:23:12] began to sing.
[2:23:16] Their chains were loose.
[2:23:20] Hallelujah.
[2:23:22] and they were free.
[2:23:26] Oh, I bless your name. Bless your name.
[2:23:31] I bless your name.
[2:23:36] I give you
[2:23:43] praise. We want to praise you.
[2:23:48] [Music]
[2:23:51] The truth, the way.
[2:23:56] I bless your name.
[2:24:00] I bless your name.
[2:24:08] Some midnight hour. If you should,
[2:24:14] you will find your
[2:24:18] real present
[2:24:21] in your life.
[2:24:25] Reach out and reach out.
[2:24:28] Reach out.
[2:24:30] [Music]
[2:24:37] Yes, they will fall in Jesus name.
[2:24:44] I bless your name.
[2:24:49] I bless your name.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Bless your name. I give you
[2:24:57] [Music]
[2:24:58] honor. Give you praise.
[2:25:02] Praise you.
[2:25:06] You are
[2:25:08] just the way.
[2:25:13] I bless your name.
[2:25:18] I bless your name.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; I'd like to sing I'd like to sing that
[2:25:22] third verse again.
[2:25:24] [Music]
[2:25:26] That second verse. Yes.
[2:25:29] And when we come to the chorus,
[2:25:32] don't just sing the words.
[2:25:35] I give you honor.
[2:25:39] I give you praise.
[2:25:41] You look up and just say it to him.
[2:25:44] Don't even you don't even need the words
[2:25:46] on the screen for that. Dedicate
[2:25:48] yourself. And I'm going to have a
[2:25:50] prayer.
[2:25:54] And for those of you, I know that God is
[2:25:55] speaking to some very, very definitely.
[2:25:59] I want you to say, "This is the hour.
[2:26:01] This is the time.
[2:26:03] I'm making my choice.
[2:26:08] I will see you again.
[2:26:11] I will see you again.
[2:26:14] if not here on the other side.
[2:26:24] And the same prophet said,
[2:26:27] and if you can't believe me, believe
[2:26:29] him.
[2:26:32] He said, we will be sitting with him.
[2:26:35] [Music]
[2:26:36] Those
[2:26:38] that went by and came back again
[2:26:42] will be sitting with him
[2:26:46] looking down at others that went the
[2:26:48] other direction.
[2:26:55] Don't put me in that place,
[2:26:58] please.
[2:27:00] I'd look down, look in the same faces
[2:27:01] I'm looking at now.
[2:27:05] Say, "Remember that night? Remember that
[2:27:07] morning?
[2:27:11] Remember that day you heard this?
[2:27:19] You looked down from the balcony. You
[2:27:21] saw my heart bleeding.
[2:27:25] You had that opportunity.
[2:27:32] Don't Don't make that happen.
[2:27:36] Just make your decision
[2:27:38] a eternal decision. Now,
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; not based on anything emotional, based
[2:27:44] on a business transaction with God.
[2:27:49] This scene will repeat again.
[2:27:52] [Music]
[2:27:55] And that's what the prophet said and
[2:27:57] that's what I believe.
[2:28:01] some midnight hour.
[2:28:06] [Music]
[2:28:09] You're in a prison
[2:28:15] in your mind.
[2:28:19] Reach out and pray.
[2:28:24] Defy those who chase.
[2:28:31] Yes, they will fall in Jesus
[2:28:35] name.
[2:28:38] I bless your name.
[2:28:40] [Music]
[2:28:43] I bless your name.
[2:28:47] I give you
[2:28:50] [Music]
[2:28:54] praise.
[2:29:02] the truth.
[2:29:06] I bless your name.
[2:29:11] I bless your name.
[2:29:16] We just bow our heads. I want to thank
[2:29:18] you
[2:29:21] for your kindness,
[2:29:23] for your true Christian spirit,
[2:29:26] for you faithful, faithful believers.
[2:29:30] I love you.
[2:29:33] Our Lord Jesus loves us with an undying
[2:29:37] love because we love his word.
[2:29:40] We love his messenger.
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We love his message. We love
[2:29:46] the words.
[2:29:47] Oh, they're sweeter than honey in the
[2:29:49] comb.
[2:29:50] [Music]
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, our Lord Jesus.
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; You have spoken to our hearts.
[2:30:00] And there are some I know that you have
[2:30:02] spoken. We're not being backward or
[2:30:05] bashful about it. You're speaking very,
[2:30:08] very deeply.
[2:30:11] Don't let Don't let anyone you're
[2:30:13] dealing with depart this
[2:30:16] place in a state of turmoil,
[2:30:20] oh God. And don't let the voice of Satan
[2:30:24] continue to ring in their ears. But may
[2:30:26] they defy the chains.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; And they shall fall in Jesus' name.
[2:30:33] Yeah.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; All they have to do is speak with their
[2:30:36] mouth and confess with their lips, oh
[2:30:38] God, the Lord Jesus Christ, and claim
[2:30:42] you as Lord. Lord,
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; you are Lord. You are Lord. You're Lord
[2:30:46] of my life. You're Lord of my future.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; And by your grace, I will be in that
[2:30:55] number your messenger saw.
[2:30:59] Oh God, let me be one that f fulfills
[2:31:02] that vision.
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; I believe I believe I believe he saw me.
[2:31:09] I believe he saw me. And the devil's
[2:31:12] trying to tell me something different
[2:31:13] and I deny his lie.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; In the holy righteous name of Jesus
[2:31:19] Christ, liver every doubt, flee.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we thank you. I pray that now
[2:31:27] Lord as victory comes joy will come
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; to the lives of those it only takes a
[2:31:33] moment
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; as a prophet has spoke to people so many
[2:31:36] times and ask them if they believed and
[2:31:40] they went from an unbeliever to a
[2:31:41] believer in a few moments of time
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus do it now in this close of this
