Your love is to me. Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary, pure and holy, tried and true with thanksgiving. I'll be a living sanctuary. Oh, for you. Yes, Lord. Prepare me in my heart, Lord. And you try and true with I'll be a living sanctuary for [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; I trust that's your desire this morning. &gt;&gt; Lord, may the fire of God fall on this little vessel. &gt;&gt; Prepare me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. To be a house for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Want to greet each and every one of you into the house of the Lord this morning. Trust you brought your little lick of fire and you're just expecting a wonderful time in the presence of the Lord. He deals with our lives individual by individual &gt;&gt; that affects a family that affects a church, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, individually, we want the Lord to deal with us &gt;&gt; today. Amen. We've got a special by the Cochman family. I think we've got all two of them that were able to remain with us. So, maybe they could come and sing for us this morning. and a couple of songs maybe while they're coming and getting ready. Uh there's a green Mercury villager in the parking lot. I've got a license plate number here, but there's probably only two or three green villagers out there. So, if you've got one, maybe go check it and uh make sure the lights aren't on, so you have a battery when you leave the service this morning. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we just stand together? We'll pray and ask the Lord's blessings upon the day. It's his day. We're in his house and we want him to have the preeminence this morning. Brother Nathaniel, why don't you come and Yeah. Come and lead us in a word of prayer. We just ask the Lord and invite him for if he comes, that makes it all worth it all, doesn't it? We want to remember. Come on up, Brother Nathaniel. Got a couple of prayer requests that uh we want to make known. Brother Nathan, I'm sorry I call you Nathaniel. It's a long version, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. um a testimony from uh Sister Grace Bey thanking the Lord for healing her throat from a virus just a few weeks ago. Brother Steve Rivas is asking for prayer for uh his aunt Anna and her son live in Southern California and have just called requesting more information about the message that we believe and he's asking for wisdom and that the Lord would deal with her heart. And we want to remember Richard Drake. Um he's at home dealing with an uncontrollable cough and asking that the Lord would deliver him. If you have a need upon your heart, just as we go to prayer this morning, just make it known by the uplifted hand. Let's just bow together. Lord Jesus, it's just good to come into your presence, Father, and to worship you and in song and in prayer, thanksgiving and praise, Lord, for the shed blood of Jesus Christ. That cleanses us from all unrighteousness and makes us clean and pure and whole in your sight, Lord. &gt;&gt; Where would we be without that blood, Lord? [Music] Oh God, I thank you for that tremendous sacrifice that was made on our behalf, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, when you climbed Goltha's hill, you became our sin. Lord, you who knew no sin, Lord. You became sin that we might be free. Oh Lord, all eternity isn't enough to praise you, Father, and just give you praise for your great plan of redemption, Lord. We bless your name, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; We call upon your spirit this morning to come and move in our midst. Oh father, we've come to hear from you, Lord Jesus. Come to sit at your table, Lord, and feed from the mana that you have prepared for us, oh God. Lord, we've not come to hear from a man, oh God, but we've come to hear from you, Jesus. I pray that you'd come, Lord, in your sweet presence. Oh, Father. Lord, help us to get everything out of the way. Oh Lord Jesus, forgive us, oh God, where we've failed you. Oh God, forgive us of our iniquities, Lord. Search our hearts, Lord Jesus. Your great pillar of fire moving to and fro, Lord. Oh God, shining your word down upon our hearts, Lord Jesus. Oh God, if our faith's not lining up according to your will, Lord, I pray that you'd just fine-tune us. Oh God, correct us, oh Lord. Adjust our attitudes, Lord. Give us more love, Lord Jesus. We need more of you, oh Lord. Oh God, we're living in a very dark hour, oh God, but you are the great light that has shine in this darkness, Lord. Father, that prophet told us that at just a hour before dawn, the darkness just congeals. Oh God, but Lord, we're looking to you this morning, Lord. We're looking to you and we're going to live, Lord. We are living this morning, Lord Jesus. Oh, how we love you, Lord. And we just yearn for more of you, oh God. We bless your name, Lord. We bless your holy name, Jesus. We love you, Lord. We love your holy presence, oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh, we praise you this morning, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord, for this testimony, oh God. We thank you, Lord, that you're among us, Lord, meeting our needs, oh Father, and we give you praise, oh Lord. We hold these requests up before you, oh God. Brother Richard with a a persistent cough. Oh Lord, you have provided his healing. Lord God, it's already ours. It's been paid for. Oh God, I pray that you'd come down in Brother Richard's life and confirm your word, Lord. Touch his body, Lord. Touch his throat. Heal him, oh God. Lord, I hear others coughing in the assembly, Lord Jesus. God, just move across this building this morning and touch each life, oh God. Heal our needs, oh Lord Jesus. And this request that brother Steve has brought in, Lord. Some relatives of his, Lord, asking for more of you, Lord. I pray that you'd reveal yourself to them, oh God. Open their eyes that they might see, Lord. Anoint their hearts to receive, oh God, we pray. Bless us this morning, Lord. We just humbly commit oursel and our ways unto thee, Lord. In Jesus name we ask it. Amen. Amen. God bless you each and everyone. You may have your seats. On behalf of Bible Way Christian Academy and all those that were able to go to the little concert last night, we just had a wonderful time. We appreciate the Cochman family coming and supporting the school and each one of you that came out and contributed. We just want to say thank you. So, we'll enjoy a couple of songs this morning. Amen. Amen. It's certainly good to be with you this morning. Appreciate the spirit we've had felt here and and uh we're a long way from our earthly home, but we're right at home amongst believers. Amen. &gt;&gt; People may look a little different than we're used to or act a little different, but when you get around believers, you're right at home. &gt;&gt; Oh, and I heard them whisper. They said, "How could this be? The same man killed a thousand armored soldiers with just an old jawbone he held in his hand. But look at him now where he stands. Look at him now where he stands. know I had been such a failure. How easily I've been begun. The locks of my hair they had taken. Deceived by a woman made helpless and mild. Blind now and led by a child. Blind now and led by a child. Just once more, Lord. Show me your will. My eneies mock me. They say you're not real. Though I have failed, you remember me still. Just once more, Lord. [Music] In the midst of their allout celebration, I pray. Oh God, hear my cry. Just once more, Lord, send your spirit. Come down and strengthen me just one more time. With him, Lord, now let me die. &gt;&gt; With them, Lord, now let me die. &gt;&gt; My hands found the two mighty pillars that held up the place I was in. I cried, "Avenge me, mine eyes, Lord." And the building came down upon all those within. God had prevailed in the end. My God had prevailed in the end. Just once more, Lord. Show me your will. My enies mock me. They say you're not real. Though I have failed, you remember me still. Just once more, Lord. [Music] Though I have failed, you remember me still. Just once more, Lord. [Music] [Applause] [Music] He knew each mistake. He knew the roads I take. He knew the hearts I'd break with every mile. [Music] He knew the dreams I sold. He knew each lie I told. He watched regrets unfold. Yet he loved me all. the wild. How could I ever love my God enough? &gt;&gt; Where would I be if not for his healing touch? I know that he knew me as I was. But he saw me through a Savior's eyes of love. He knew the loneliness. He saw my life a mess. He watched tears of distress each time I cried. And he knew I'd walk away. But he knew that another day he would whisper as I knelt to pray that he'd loved me all the while. How could I ever love my God enough? Where would I be if not for his healing touch? I know that he knew me as I was. But he saw me through a Savior's eyes of love [Music] through the blessed Savior's eyes of love. [Applause] Amen. We certainly appreciate that gifts of God. We get to enjoy them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for coming and blessing us with those songs this morning, Brother Ben and Sister Caroline. Amen. As the Sunday school children make their way to their seats, why don't we just sing another chorus or two and prepare our hearts. May the ministering of the word deal in our lives today. Keep your mind stayed on me. 417 on the screen. Keep your mind [Music] stay on me. Stay on me faithfully and I will give you perfect peace. Sweet release. If you'll just keep your mind stay on me.

Oh, let me from this day. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Well, nice to see you standing and singing, but I have a few things I'd like to say before we turn to the word. So, I'll just have you have your seats once again. Uh so happy to have our brother and sister Cochman, their family. Uh three of the boys had to leave this morning. Uh you know, it's all work and some work duties. Uh, I I remember I'll just say to brother Sister Cochman and the three boys that had to leave, you can tell them I was uh I was way out in the wilderness with brother Brandham one time and and he was going to be there a couple weeks and and I could only be one week. Uh I had to go to work and uh so we were a long ways. I mean, we were probably 20 25 miles in on horseback off the Alaskan Highway. So, I uh I just felt so down. I'm sure if you were with Brother Brandham, you all would feel down, too. I just thought this this just isn't right. You know, I got to go to work. And uh and and and it seems that God knows just how to compound things to make them worse and worse. You know, have you ever had that? And the night before they'd seen some beautiful big mountain rams and that was actually that was the night we slept out under the tree and that's the one that Sister Marilyn painted that picture brother Brandham. That was the noon noon before. And so I just said to brother Bud casually, I said, "Well, will Blaine ride out with me?" Oh, no. He said, "You know, the horse knows its way out. The horse knows its way out. We're we're foring a river probably 15 or 20 times." And I've been on horses when they just walked into the bush and put their head against a tree and waited for your command. You know, what do you want them to do? And I didn't know my way out of there 25, 30 miles. And uh we woke up that morning and guess what? We were in the biggest snowstorm you ever wanted to see. And I thought, I got to ride out of here alone with a horse that I don't really know. Is he going to make his way out? And I got to leave Brother Brandham. And and and I had I had two real heavy things weighing on my heart. They were just crushing and I'd wanted to talk to him and never got the chance. And uh so they were all having their you know fun time and joshing around in the cook tent after breakfast and I was out there in that little tent rolling up my sleeping bag and I was just rolling it up and and was I feeling low? I don't know if you can get any lower. And here come brother Brandham with the flaps open and he come crawling in on his hands and knees and sat with his cross legs crossed and just squatted. He said, "Well, Brother Eddie, sure hate to see you go." Well, you know what I did? I just I bit my lip because I didn't want to cry in front of him. I said, "Yeah, brother Brandon, I sure hate to go, too." But he said, "I I know I know what it's like. you know, you're got a family and you got to go to work and got those responsibilities. And I was just acknowledging, yeah, and I just kept rolling up my sleeping bag. And he said, and u he said, uh, I I know all about the church in Dawson Creek and about your sister. And he just took those two things right out of my heart like that. And guess what the next thing was? My horse found his way out. So, so that that just, you know, two lines and maybe you think this morning, oh, we need some big, you know, shocking answer from above. No, we just need God to speak a couple of lines to us and we don't know. Might be in a song and might be in a testimony. It might be in whatever more. But we're so happy uh brother Cochman, you and your wife and and uh I don't I know he's the youngest. I know he's the tallest and his wife is there with him. God bless you. And Carolyn at sang. I really appreciate that. I want to just say brother Jake Dick just arrived. Where's brother Jake? Is he here this morning? just arrived back from Mexico and uh took some print uh print stations down. Was there more than one, Brother Cam? No, two. Two. And I just got an email this morning from Singapore. And the people that, you know, they just they hear about a need and they just want to respond. And they heard about Vietnam and they sent a print station over there. and uh and and now brother uh brother brother Timothy he's over there and they had a burden they sent another one over there then they emailed this morning said we want to send one to Africa we hear there's a need for them in Africa brother Kim was telling me this last week there's over 100 print stations already out and operating in the different countries and when you start to think that each one of them the formula is that each one of them can actually provide for about 10 smaller groups. You start talking about a thousand churches and they have the ability to have their books right on demand. You can understand why some of these people are burning them up. They're just burning them up. And it's wonderful to have a vision. I I really I really fear if we lose our vision. We sing the song uh don't lose your vision of Jesus. Well, who is Jesus? Jesus is the revealed word. &gt;&gt; And I got thinking, you know, I've heard some sometimes some negative things about missions and missions people don't understand. Maybe they haven't been there. Uh and and uh we were just doing a little bit of a a summary what's what's taking place because things are changing rapidly in some certain countries like in Africa and also in India, especially in India. And brother Kim was telling me there's been I think what is it 12 million 12 million message books that have been printed there. And I just thought of the people who've read and the people who have you know just it's been quickened to them. Who are they looking at? &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the one that's making himself known. And so I just want to say that also want to let the church and all those that are streaming, we certainly welcome them in the congregation as well. And uh uh they uh uh they're they're planning on having a dedication for the church that we've been helping them with in Moscow. And uh and the Lord has uh just really burdened our hearts. So, they're sending, I think, $32,000 US uh this next week to to Moscow so they can finish it and be in by the winter. And uh so I thank God for that and all those that are have contributed and so on. Then yesterday, just amazing, you know, it takes me a few minutes to get through this. Just yesterday, Brother Milo says he got a phone call from Serbia and some doors have opened in Macedonia and uh they they they're calling and I got thinking of the of the scripture uh and there stood a man before Paul. There stood a man of Macedonia saying, "Come over &gt;&gt; into Macedonia and help us." &gt;&gt; Think of it. &gt;&gt; And a man in Macedonia now again in our time &gt;&gt; has called our brothers in Serbia and have said, "Come over and help us." Hallelujah. And you know what? We're going to do what Paul did. Hallelujah. The brothers are going to go. They're going to go as soon as they can. And I can assure you there are people over there that are waiting to hear it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we'll do anything that we can to see that they get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Murphy comes I hope this next week, isn't it? Sister Tracy, are you happy? And we're going to be so anxious to hear from Brother Murphy after a couple of months in China. My my I hope we can absorb all of these things and and it's just uh just wonderful. Well, now I'll have you stand if you would and I'm going to read a couple of scriptures. Uh maybe just before we read, I'd like to sing uh that I found a love that pardons. said I found a love and pardon. Oh, said I found some stripes that he [Applause] said I found strength for my weakness. My weakness I found grace to cover all my sins. Oh, it's in Jesus. Holy Jesus. Oh, it's in Jesus. He's the one. Holy one is our salvation. He's a firm foundation. It's in Jesus. the Lord. It's in Jesus. It's in Jesus. Only Jesus. It's in Jesus. He's Jesus. Let's give him all the glory. He's the rock sal. He's the perfect foundation. It's in Jesus. He's the one. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's worthy of all of our praise. Well, God bless you. As you take your Bibles, we're going to turn to two scriptures. Hebrews the 9th chapter, the 28th verse. And I'm also going to read from Daniel the 12th chapter and the 4th verse. appreciate you all having your Bibles and being able to read and follow along. I have quite a number of uh of also some PowerPoint text because we're going to be going uh through subject that I would like to make it as clear as possible. There'll be a lot of food for thought uh this morning. I trust and trust you all have your spiritual mental caps on. &gt;&gt; All right. Just before we read, we'll pray. We're approaching you, Father. Because your spirit is the author of this word. &gt;&gt; You're the only one that can interpret it. &gt;&gt; You're the only one that can really reveal it and make it known to us. And so we pray that each individual person will grasp those eternal words that are passing through this building at this moment. I pray that you will anoint my lips, oh God, with a fresh fire uh from off the altar of God and that you will anoint the hearing of the people. Cause our vision, Lord, and our sight to see what your will is. Bless your people now, Lord, in this entire day. Thinking of those that are going to be baptized tonight. Oh, Holy Spirit. I know you will not fail them. You will fill them. This is your promise uh to be repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. And then may that be their portion. Now we thank you, Father. Father, we commit this day to you in Jesus lovely, lovely name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to read the 28th verse of Hebrews 9 first. So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many. And unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation. While you're looking at that verse, I I would like to uh just divide these sentences. Unto them unto them that look for him, whoever he is, who are they looking for? Someone to come out of the skies or uh where are they looking and what are they looking for? Uh, Brother Brham said, "This is the symbol of God." This book right here, that's a that's God on printed page. And then when he reveals it, that's God living. And so unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Without sin unto salvation. And then in Daniel the 12th chapter verse 4, God spoke to his prophet Daniel said, "But thou, oh Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end." Many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased. Amen. You may have your seats. We are most certainly living in a time of incredible expansion. And I I got thinking, how am I going to describe this? I thought, well, this is a knowledge explosion that's happening. &gt;&gt; And I thought that's something. Yeah. I thought about that phrase, this knowledge explosion. And so I just, you know, I just Googled it. I thought, well, somebody else has obviously, you know, thought of that phrase that's not that unique. And it it came up all over the place. All kinds of people have used those exact words. And uh it was really quite interesting, quite amazing. One one said that uh in the future things are moving at such a rapid pace that in the future everyone would have fame for 15 minutes. That's how fast things are going to are going. That's a direction. uh and and some other studies and these are these are in-depth studies uh from so-called very knowledgeable people and uh they are saying that because of the media and the way that things are presented at this time and with such a fast increased speed and while I say that remember brother Brandham speaking about the fulfillment of the seven visions which he had and five of them already fulfilled and he was predicting the ushering ing in of the millennium. He said, I predict I do not prophesy was in the church ages. I predict that the that the uh the ushering in of the millennium, he said, by 1977. Well, if you if you take the word, I don't want to get onto this, but you talk about ushering in. The bride is being ushered in. Well, where is she? Is she just uh coming out of the car? Is she in the parking lot? Is she just entering into the foyer? Where is the bride being ushered in? And so the whole word and concept of ushering is that there's a there's a a movement there that things have been set into place. They're set into motion. And I believe exactly what he said, but he made a very interesting comment and that was that uh because of the rapid pace and speed and with which things were happening, he made the prediction on that basis. And so now he's tying two things together. Not only the vision but the speed by which things are unfolding. And we are certainly in that time. Amen. And uh and and this one uh people uh uh this one uh fac uh university that was studying these things was saying that it is happening with such speed and and so all the data and the knowledge is coming in one direction and then the uh enabling each individual and even children to both visually and uh use the technology to to send and to connect and the connection of the world. They said it's actually going to change the whole face of civilization and it is changing it. We're actually in it right now. And uh and and so uh we certainly are in that time when knowledge shall be increased. It's also called because of this and the uh whole globe becoming merely a village. It's it's said it's an age of tolerance and and that has its good side and has its bad side. Uh the age of tolerance uh we have even here in the church in Vancouver itself and many many cities have become multicultural cities and whe that's wonderful. We really think that that is a wonderful aspect and that's going to continue and that's going to increase because of the connectivity of the peoples of the world. So there's ethnic groups and there's age groups and there's geographical regions and there are religious beliefs. But then that's where we have to start to be careful about tolerance about religious beliefs because all kinds of things are being done. Uh in fact there's a on the news last night just driving home from uh the uh musical presentation out in Abbottzford. They said there's been 300 people, I guess this year, just in Afghanistan or in Iraq, 300 people have been killed by suicide bombers. And but that's all in the name of religion. I personally don't believe that religion. &gt;&gt; I don't believe that God is the author of that kind of thing. And so the acceptance of of of uh religious beliefs and the acceptance of sexual orientation and that's where we start ending our broadmindedness &gt;&gt; and the openness and the tolerance and the acceptance but also it also is uh gives way to patience and charity and the ability to endure hardships or to put up with harsh or diff difficult uh uh conditions. We have all of that that that comes in this uh in in this particular age that we're in. But we're in a time or season, and now we're going to take a real swift turn. We're in a time or season that is actually between, now we're going right into the depths of the message right at the beginning, between the feast of the trumpets and the seventh seal. And that's why you'll need to really keep your thinking caps on. And when I refer to the trumpets and when you hear the word trumpets, I want you to think of voice. When you hear the word of thunders or seven thunders, I want you just to think of voice. And when you hear the phrase third pull, I want you to think of voice. a voice. And when I speak of a messenger, then I want you to think of a voice. And we're going to take a certain a certain perspective which I think is very very important and something that you'll ponder on long after this service. So when I say trumpets, you think of voice, thunders, you think of voice, messenger, you think of voice. And when we think of the third pull, you think of voice because that's where it all focuses down. And this is we're living in an in between time. Now, as brother John Andy's was preaching on Wednesday, and I just would remind you one thing. He said sometimes there are events and times and periods in our life that are progressive and then God can deal with us in a very quick in a very short intense way in a moment of time and that is true. Now, now we've been in the age we say Luke 17:30 a day when the son of man will be revealed. Well, uh, a lot of a lot has happened and I'll be coming into specific details, but, uh, Christ was Christ was put out of the church. &gt;&gt; Well, that's already happened. The word's already been put out. So, that's history. &gt;&gt; So, we're way beyond that. A and a bride would be called out. That's already happened. So, that's all in this period of time. So, we have progressed all through that. So we can say that has taken place. The bride has been called out. She has been identified and all these various things that are to take place. And I'll be touching just on some of them just to keep you focused that this is a now we've zeroed in. We're we're down into a vortex in a very very short period of time. And uh and we will not know. I I want to be honest with you. I do not believe any one of us will know everything that is happening because it'll be happening so quickly. We have been watching Israel. Israel to become a nation that's already happened but that had to happen in this era in this time and and Israel is God's time piece and we do watch that but none of us here understand all of the events that are happening there. Sometimes a certain thing happens, we say, "Yay, yeah, that's supposed to because we see it. It agrees with us and agrees with what we understand the message to say." And then the next time you say, "Oh my goodness, what's happening now?" It all seems to be going in reverse. You know, they seem to be advancing towards uh uh the fulfillment of the scripture. Then it seems to be going backwards. But even when you and I think it's going backwards, there's still God's time piece. It's just that we're not reading it exactly right. But I want you to know and to keep keep focused on this that it is moving in the direction that it's supposed to go and nothing is out of the plan of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're at this in between time between the feast of the trumpets. Now, you won't have time if you want to jot it down or or or or just make a note, but the seven feasts the seven feasts and they're all Christ. And so don't get lost in this. There are seven feasts in Leviticus the 23rd chapter. And I'm only going to mention uh maybe three or four of these feasts because it it it it's necessary for the uh message today. But the the feast of the trumpets, which brother Brandham preach pre preached the feast of the trumpets. He did not preach the feast of the tabernacles. He did not preach like the feast of Pentecost. He did place them. But in the the feast of trumpets, he preached that after the seals. And then but between the feast of the trumpets and the tabernacles because tabernacles, let me let me just give you very quickly so you can connect with my thought which I believe the Holy Spirit has been dealing with me about for some time. God, no one knew really what God was like. You know, God was a pillar of fire and a burning bush and a burning mountain on Mount Si. And God was a fearsome God of judgment and came down with the commandments which none of the people could keep. And so their concept and understanding of God, but God, there was really no change of tabernacle until God came and tabernacled in a body of flesh called Jesus Christ. That was a feast. &gt;&gt; And that is why Jesus said, "Unless you eat my flesh, &gt;&gt; unless you eat this mana, unless you eat this bread and drink this blood, there is no life in you." In other words, this is God's feast &gt;&gt; of tabernacles. But he didn't come just to be a single individual, a second Adam. He was going to come and tabernacle in a body of people. and the conclusion and the ultimate of that uh feast of tabernacles. We're going to have a feast in another body. &gt;&gt; And now we have a prophet in this end time. We didn't know this before. You never heard anyone else preach it before, but telling us that you you have a word body, you have a thought, theophony right next to you. &gt;&gt; And you know that today only because he said it. It's important that you recognize, and this is where I'm going to be coming to further in the message, we need to look at what has been spoken &gt;&gt; and hold our focus on what has been spoken, not on how we feel or how we think things are going or what we see taking place, but we need to see what he was looking at. And that's going to be my theme today. We need to see what brother Brandham was looking at, what God had focused him on and then he spoke it so that we could look at it. &gt;&gt; So the feast of trumpets comes between uh between the feast of trumpets and between the tabernacles. Now the feast of trumpets is between between Pentecost because now we have this age of grace, this long period of Pentecost and the day of atonement. And the day of atonement is when when the Jews will recognize him. The day of the age of grace is when the Gentiles recognize him. And then comes the day of but then comes the feast of trumpets. And the trumpets is a voice. The trumpets can be uh not a preaching necessarily. It's it is something that speaks to the people and draws them back. The people have always been drawn by trumpets in Israel. You'll be called and you'll do this and you'll have a trumpet for war and you'll have a trumpet for Jubilee and you'll have a trumpet. That's why Apostle Paul said, "If it gives an uncertain sound, how will they know what to do?" But it has to give a certain sound. And so there were people even before the Second World War, I've met them. Not many, just one here, one there. But they were they they they were felt something within them, moving within them. And they left and were called back to go back to Israel. old men, people who had a promise of their family business, they gave it all up. Said, "I have to go back to Israel." What was it? There was a voice, an inner voice calling them back to the homeland because the prophet said that God cannot bless them outside of the homeland. So, it's a voice of Almighty God calling them back for the blessing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so between the when we say Pentecost, that's the that's the time of the gentile calling. And then between that and the day of atonement or the feast of atonement. Between those comes the trumpets. And so the prophet now he's the end time messenger of the Gentiles. At the end of the gentile age, which is the feast of Pentecost, and at the end he preaches the seals. and on on on and unveils Christ in in that way comes to the seventh seal speaking of the coming of Christ and then preaches the feast of the trumpets because he's announcing that Israel will be gathered. They're over there now. And how many times he said they're over there now their flag is flying. They've got their own money. They have their own nation. Everything else they've been gathered back what for? for the atonement because that's the next feast and after that is the feast of tabernacles and the change of the body and that's the last &gt;&gt; so we have in this feast we have the we have the feast of first fruits which was the resurrection the first fruits Jesus was the first fruits of the resurrection and when they and and he said when you come into the land and you receive your first fruits See, they had to actually live out the these feasts. So when you come into the land and you plant your field and the first the first ripe grain, the first grain that turns ripe, you'll cut it down. They were actually fulfilling the scripture because Jesus was the first one that would come and be actually God in flesh. He was the first ripe one. &gt;&gt; He was the first mature one. And and here God is spelling it out and showing in such beautiful detail. You'll cut that one down and you'll bring it. And notice, please, I can't go into it. There's just so much. But you'll take that bundle and you'll bring it to the priest. Not the prophet. To the priest. Because when Jesus was here on earth, he was a son of man prophet. &gt;&gt; Then he died, shed his blood, and rose. And as he rose, ascended with his blood, and went into the holy of holies, that was the priest's office. &gt;&gt; So that's why he was son of God. He was son of man, fulfilling the promise on earth. Then he he took the place of son of God. And that's why John the Baptist, the spirit of Elijah, announced him as the lamb of God because it was not the prophet that went into the holy of holies. It was the priest that went into the holy of holies. So now he had to enter into the priest's office. And in the priest's office, the scripture says he entered in once &gt;&gt; with his own blood &gt;&gt; for you sitting here today. Hallelujah. The atonement is there &gt;&gt; by the pure spotless blood and Jesus entered into his priesthood. And that is why the prophet, the messenger in the end time, the spirit of Elijah once again Elijah announced him, "Behold the lamb of God." And then at the end here comes the the um uh Elijah for the for the Gentiles and he preaches who is this MelzDC? MelzDC wasn't prophet now he's a priest. He said who is this Melzdc? This priest &gt;&gt; that that has no beginning of days and no end of life. &gt;&gt; He's the same one that met met Abraham back there. And when he made Abraham, he made him as prophet, priest. Abraham was prophet and he came in the office of priest and king. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because to us, he he had to end this church age and come with this last messenger and reveal himself. &gt;&gt; Every time brother says, "Oh, that pillar of fire is moving. It's moving. Oh, there it is over that man there." He said, "Who did he touch?" &gt;&gt; He didn't say the prophet. He's always said the high priest. &gt;&gt; He touched the high priest &gt;&gt; always. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful friends? &gt;&gt; This is a feast. &gt;&gt; And we came to another feast at the end of this Pentecostal era. &gt;&gt; And then when he when he raised when Jesus was cut down, he was the first mature grain. And the bi and the Bible tells us that he he raised and he ascended with his own blood. And the prophet now comes in this time. How beautiful it was. He ties those two together. And he says, "And he was waved over the people, blessing them as he departed to go into the Holy of Holies." Hallelujah. And he's waved over the people. Oh, how thankful I am for the interpretation of the message by a prophet messenger. And he said, why was he being waved over the people? It was a memorial to God that there's more like him in the field. &gt;&gt; You were still in the field. You young people, the bodies you sit in was in the earth. When Jesus was waved over the people, &gt;&gt; every one of us here, our bodies, which is just part of the uh chemistry of the earth, this flesh was laying here. And God almighty took the accepted sacrifice and waved it over you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He waved it over you as a memorial. There's more like this son &gt;&gt; in whom I'm well pleased. &gt;&gt; And that's why Paul said, "You're accepted in the beloved." &gt;&gt; You're already accepted back there when your bodies hadn't even been conceived yet. &gt;&gt; I say, "Glory be to God." &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful to be accepted in the beloved? &gt;&gt; And that was all laid back laid in the in the in the scriptures back in Leviticus already. I just have to hold myself back because there's just so much. I have to watch my time, too. Incidentally, your dinner with brother and sister Cochman, the Cochman family, I was told, is at 1:30. So, we don't be nervous. And then, and then after the first sheath was waved, then they had 50 days later, they have Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Pentecost. And at Pentecost there's a waving of a loaf &gt;&gt; and he was the loaf &gt;&gt; and there was waving and that loaf was to have no leaven in it. &gt;&gt; None &gt;&gt; because there was no leaven in him. But then they had two loaves and they waved these two because it was representing the church and they had leaven in them and it showed that there would be you know we have the cornality and we all have our problems and that would be with us through to the end &gt;&gt; and so we weren't exclusive of of levan we had and and so it showed it even back there that there'd be leaven but they would be also waved before God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we had the uh feast of Pentecost. I say the wave of the loaves. And then the the prophet said during in the message the feast of the trumpets, &gt;&gt; he said and he called the gentile church out through this Pentecostal feast. And we know that. And then we have the after that we said the feast of trumpets and the day of atonement in the message. Once again, please just hold this closely in your mind. In the message, feast of the trumpets, uh, paragraph 38, he said, "And they said, oh my," because the trumpets all refer to Israel, not to the prophet. The reason why you say, "Well, why would brother Brandham cover that then?" because we need to know where we're at &gt;&gt; and what is taking place and because some of these things are kind of o being overlap overlapping. So he said, "And they will say, "Oh my, did we actually miss seeing him?" &gt;&gt; Uh, "Was that the atonement &gt;&gt; and we've missed?" &gt;&gt; Oh, God. He said, "And they said they just separate themselves," speaking of the Jews, "and mourned for days." He said, "What is it?" He said, "It's the atonement, &gt;&gt; the sadness." This time he said this time the coming of the or making known the atonement notice this closely is not the regular atonement being killed &gt;&gt; because they had a they had an atonement in the scripture which atoned for their sins &gt;&gt; but he said in Leviticus this is not the regular atonement being killed like in Leviticus 16. So they had an atonement there. But he says Leviticus 23 is a morning time for of their sins of their sins that their sins was they rejected it. It was a morning time that they had missed they had missed the atonement because they are recognizing Christ. He goes on to say the Pentecostal feast is paragraph 36. Actually I'm going back. The par the Pentecostal feast finishes at the period of the seventh trumpet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "For the next is the coming or or the seventh seal for the next is the mystery of the coming of Christ." &gt;&gt; And also the trumpet is to sound for the Jews. &gt;&gt; So now there's a calling of the Jews. So there's something that's happening at the same time. &gt;&gt; And this is what I'm I'm going into. So we have a trumpet sounding for the Jews and the seventh seal next is the mystery of the coming of Christ. So it's not just the coming of Christ, the mystery &gt;&gt; of the coming of Christ. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He says their sixth trumpet is sound and when it does it makes known to them the revealed son of God. &gt;&gt; He said one half hour is fixed. Remember all trumpets sound on the sixth seal. So on the sixth seal, all the trumpets sound because that's a tribulation seal. &gt;&gt; The sixth seal finishes the mystery under the sixth seal just before the seventh is opened. &gt;&gt; He said Leviticus 23 and 26. How in order is the scripture after the long period of Pentecost, he said which Israel did reject back there. They rejected it. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Okay. They rejected him. They rejected Pentecost. That's what Paul was busy doing, throwing them in prison and all the rest of it. So, the Jews had rejected it. He says, "And he called the Gentile church out through the Pentecostal feast." So, now we've got the Pentecostal feast and he's called the Gentiles out during that time. Now if you're reading the feast of the trumpets and many of you have there's brother Bradom like gets in a confusion there and he but he does settle it in questions and answers 1964 uh in 9 965-204. I'm only giving that for you for your reference there. But he said like the other day he said I got something mixed up. I happened to hear it and he says, "I caught it right there and it's on the tape and I'll probably hear from it." When I was talking about the seven trumpets, I said it was seven trumpets. I was referring to the Pentecostal feast. From the Pentecostal feast until the trumpets, there was seven Sabbaths. He said seven Sabbaths was between the feast of Passover to Pentecost, which made the 50 days. So, he corrected. If you're in there and you say, "Well, I I can't make this match up." I just dropped that in to let you know that's why you can't make it match up because he he said it he got he got mixed up himself and but he answers it in questions and answers. The 50 days was between the resurrection and Pentecost and then the long period which didn't have any specific time identified which was the feast of Pentecost. But then he comes and I want to come to this seventh seal mystery. &gt;&gt; The seventh seal mystery or the coming of Christ. He said in the first seal and this is in the first seal. He said his coming. He said nobody's going to know when I'm coming. I'm just coming. &gt;&gt; That's all. It isn't for It isn't for my business, speaking of himself to know when. I'll just be ready. That's that's the main thing. Then he said, "If Satan could get a hold of it, &gt;&gt; he can do a lot of damage." &gt;&gt; And he goes into that quote. He says, "I know better than to tell people you know what I'm going to do cuz when I do," he says, "Once you speak it, Satan hears it." And then he caused all kinds of trouble with it. So, so he said that he'll just keep it. He'll keep it quiet. He's trying to bring it down in our language. If Satan could get a hold of it, he said he could do a great damage. So in Revelation 8:1 it says, "And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour." And that's it. That's the whole seal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the seventh seal, he said the breaking of this seal was so great &gt;&gt; that heaven was hushed by it, hushed by it in silence for the space of half an hour. &gt;&gt; He said, "It is the secret that no one knows about." out. Now, just hold this if you feel that you know you're you're you're swimming and I'm going over your head or whatever more. Not really. There's a lot of a lot of material, a lot of quoting, and I'm doing a lot of reading, but I'm I I really worked hard to keep this in continuity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I So, now we've moved from the feast, we've come to the end of the gentile uh feast of Pentecost, and God sends a prophet messenger. Amen. &gt;&gt; Messenger. What' I say? A voice &gt;&gt; to speak certain things. &gt;&gt; Not just for us to hear, but for you to look at. &gt;&gt; And God opened your eyes when you gave your life to Christ. &gt;&gt; And he opened your eyes for one specific purpose so you could keep looking &gt;&gt; at the same thing. &gt;&gt; Because that voice will never change. And God knows that conditions around you are going to change. Circumstances are going to change. The world is going to change. Your friend is going to change. But what he spoke is never going to change. &gt;&gt; So he wants you to keep looking at that &gt;&gt; and everybody say amen. &gt;&gt; So he said it is the secret. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That no one knows about &gt;&gt; John. Now he identifies it. John was forbidden to write about it. That was there in the revelation even to write a symbol about it. That is why there's no activity in heaven. &gt;&gt; He said it might give it might give away the secret. &gt;&gt; And then in Matthew now it says there's one thing that Jesus identifies and one thing that Jesus said only God the father knew. &gt;&gt; And he said and he identified it. He said, "And of that day, an hour," speaking of his coming, Matthew the 24th chapter, "and of that day and that hour knoweth no man, know not the angels of heaven, but the Father only." &gt;&gt; He went on, Brother Brandham says, "If Satan could get a hold of it, he might do great damage. There's one thing he don't know. And now he can interpret anything he wants to and impersonate any kind of gift, but he can't know this. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? Something's been reserved for you. &gt;&gt; That even the devil doesn't know. &gt;&gt; And the reason he doesn't know, well, you say, "But it's in the message." But he doesn't believe the message. &gt;&gt; He's already refused it. Even his theologians refused it. So, there's one thing that the bride knows that no one else knows. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, I don't know how or exactly when." And so on so forth. You might not know specifics as much as you would like to know as the disciples did when Jesus was getting ready to leave. They said, "Are you going to restore the kingdom to Israel now?" He said, "No, that's not given for you to know." &gt;&gt; So, they weren't they were but you shall receive power. And I say to you today, there are certain maybe specifics that we'd love to know, but you shall receive power. &gt;&gt; If God withholds it from you, you shall receive power. &gt;&gt; You will be sustained. &gt;&gt; You'll be here today &gt;&gt; and you'll be in the rapture when that moment comes. &gt;&gt; Just keep looking at exactly the right thing. &gt;&gt; All right. He said seven. Now he said he can interpret any interpret impersonate anything but he can't know this. Then brother Brandon goes right on to say seven thunders. And when I say seven thunders don't don't don't don't squiggle around or think I'm going in some direction. I'm telling you exactly what he said. &gt;&gt; He said seven thunders. And when I said thunders think of what? &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Voice. and seven thunders uttered straight together like they're spelling out something. &gt;&gt; They're trying to say something, &gt;&gt; he said. But notice at that time, John started to write and he said, "Don't write it. &gt;&gt; Jesus never spoke it. John couldn't write it. Angels know nothing about it." What is it? It's the thing that Jesus said, even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it. He didn't know it himself. Only God would know it. But he but he told us when we begin to see these signs. When we begin to see these signs, look up, &gt;&gt; these signs coming up, but at that day and hour knoweth no man. And Jesus said, "Not the angels which are in heaven." Mark 13:32, "Neither the Son, but the Father." &gt;&gt; Amen. In the seventh seal again, paragraph 558, he said, "Satan will try to impersonate. He'll try to impersonate everything, but this one thing he cannot impersonate." He said, "There will be no mimics of this." &gt;&gt; I tell you what, there's no mimics of this. &gt;&gt; Because he doesn't know it and there's no way for him to know it. And then brother Brandham identifies it. It's the third pull. So now we have we have the thunders, we have the messenger, we have the third pull, &gt;&gt; and we have the trumpets. And so we say trumpets voice, &gt;&gt; messenger voice, &gt;&gt; third pull voice, &gt;&gt; thunders voice. They're all p all focused on the same thing. And that's why it had to be the last part of brother Bram's ministry. &gt;&gt; The first pull with a sign in the hand for the body. The second pull reveal the secret of your heart. But the third pull is the word. And that is the word that is empowered to transform us and change this creature into an immortal creature. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Do you accept that? &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the third pull. He just knows nothing about it. He doesn't understand it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Things that happen in this in between time and there's just so so much. You have to forgive me. I can't possibly begin to identify it. But in the feast of the trumpets, brother Brandham is speaking out of Isaiah 27 and 12 and 13. And there's a sound of a a great trumpet, which again is a voice. He says, "And he talks about Israel returning and at this end sign." You use the word end sign. And so I have number one, we're talking about things that are happening in this in between time. Number one, all the nations will recognize Israel. Israel's in her homeland. &gt;&gt; I guess they do. &gt;&gt; The United Nations is there. They all recognize it. Uh he said then the bride will come to be with the bridegroom &gt;&gt; and the bridegroom with the bride. &gt;&gt; It's already happened friends. &gt;&gt; It's passed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the great millennium after the whole world is destroyed by atomic power and there will be a new heaven and a new earth shall live together. And notice he says the ministry of Moses and Elijah begin between the sixth and seventh trumpet will be two prophets. I say prophets or messenger. What it'll be? It'll be a voice. &gt;&gt; And it'll be one they hear. &gt;&gt; And he says Israel will always believe their prophets. Brother Brandham just stops and drops in there and some I think maybe got uh got turned around on a wee bit. He said, "You remember about 5 years ago on my way to India, he said uh he said don't do it." And they said, "If this is the Messiah, let us see him do the sign of the prophet and we believe the prophet." Brother Louie Petrus. Brother Louie Petrus was a pastor, I think, of the largest Pentecostal church in Stockholm, Sweden, one of the largest in the world. He had about 8,000 members at at that time. And he said, and brother Louie Petra sent them uh those Bibles. He said, a million, give them a million of them out to them Jews coming in from Iran and everywhere, coming back, assembling themselves together, becoming a nation. And I thought, this is my time. I was ready in Cairo, Egypt. And he said, don't do it now. The hour's not yet. Then I returned home. But the spirit of Elijah was in him was calling to go there. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; But Moses and Elijah will be those prophets that will go there and that's all part of the trumpets. But he had to speak that because it's part of our scene. &gt;&gt; It's part it's things we have to understand. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; It says Moses and Elijah Moses and Elijah's got to call the Pentecostal Jubilee still going or had up till this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he said the first feast of trumpets has to be known and this one over here in Malachi 4 is not connected with that one over there. Not at all. Not at all. &gt;&gt; So that individual, brother Brandham, is not the one that will go over there, but they'll believe the same message because it's going to be the same messenger. And what is the message? The message is Christ. &gt;&gt; And they will believe the same Christ. &gt;&gt; It will reveal Christ to them. &gt;&gt; But it'll be a mystery to us because we won't even be here during that time. And even if we were, we wouldn't know it any more than they know about William Brown. &gt;&gt; They don't know about him. Look, look what it is. &gt;&gt; He said, notice the ministry will be Moses and Elijah changing and calling Israel from the Jewish traditions that they had been mixed up in uh be being prophets, they'll believe him, calling them to the feast of the atonement. calling them to the feast of the atonement. That's where they're going to recognize it was him &gt;&gt; that we crucified and they're going to mourn. &gt;&gt; And he says letting them recognize Christ and they'll say he's coming. He'll be here. &gt;&gt; The Jews will be gathering things like that and and then when he comes he comes say here I am. They say where do you get those scars? Now he says, "Now the same as those two prophets did, the same as those two prophets did, &gt;&gt; remember the gentile bride is to have a prophet called Elias or Elijah. That's to call them out of their traditions. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful today?" &gt;&gt; And those of you young people have been born in home. You've been born in a in a land or a home of liberty. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Many that are here have been bound were bound by traditions. &gt;&gt; And it was this voice that called you out of those traditions &gt;&gt; and had the power to deliver you. &gt;&gt; Those you from the colonies and those of you out of Catholicism and what fear how my father how he just even spent his inheritance to try to get others. He's had printed material and sent it all over the country and caused an explosion in the north country and retaliation and persecution and hatred, open hatred which I faced right on the streets. I worried for my children which were small at the time because there was such an explosion. He spent his entire inheritance printing the testimonies of converted nuns, converted priests and how he had come out of Catholicism. And I'll tell you what, I I didn't have the nerve to do it, but I even got called by some. A woman called also my home. My stepmother answered the phone. He He wasn't afraid anything. He stamped his name right on the back of everyone. Fred Biscll. Fred. Bisc. Fred. Well, the only Biscll the people in the community knew was myself because he had only lived there a short time, came back, and he wasn't very highly visual. There I was with the little log church and and so these people this woman called said I'd like to speak to Fred Biscll and my stepmother was Norwegian very very quiet woman and she just said well he's not in just moment of silence she said I'd like to burn that pig. So that was the spirit in the community. I picked up the phone one day and man said, "Hello, are you Mr. Biscll?" I said, 'Yes.' He said, "Um, I just had uh uh he gave his name and he said, I have some question about some material that's being circulated in the mail. Do you know anything?" Well, I said, "It's my father that's doing it." And I said, "Uh, if you have any questions, you really need to talk to him." Well, he said, 'Well, I I I just thought that I I would like to find out, you know, what is the intent? What is the purpose? He said, 'Some people are have been asking. I said, 'Oh, well, what kind of position are you in that people would know to come to you? Are you a minister? He said, no. I said, are you a lawyer? No. I said, then what position are you in that people? Well, he said, you know, I I just wanted to get some personal information about it. And he completely avoided. And just at that time, the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said, "He's a priest. He's a Catholic priest." And I remembered his name. So, we had a short conversation. I wouldn't give him any information. I said, "You need to talk to my father." And soon as he hung the phone down, the priests have a residence where all the priests lived in the city. And so, I just dialed the number right back and I said, "Could I speak to Father soandso?" I said, "Just a moment. won't get him. I said, "Thank you very much." Put the phone down. You know, uh, you're not going to fool the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; I know something about nothing like my father knew about the darkness. And of course, now in this age of tolerance, &gt;&gt; they're making it more palatable. &gt;&gt; We're not so bad. You can even eat meat on Fridays and get away with it and you won't go to purgatory and all of these things. Hey, well, I'd want to get on to that. I got enough accounts and stories and actual happenings that would uh sometime make your hair stand on end. But I come to my rejoicing moment. &gt;&gt; You have been set free of those traditions. I had a Pentecostal tradition and but I was not convinced that God was three and I was not convinced about the baptism but I can tell you that the Holy Spirit through the messenger convinced me and this became an open book. &gt;&gt; Can I go on quickly for a few moments please? He said this will be the trumpet. He said the Gentiles already know the atonement, but it's to call the bride back to the original atonement. Who was the original atonement? Christ. &gt;&gt; The original atonement. And remember now that is the that is the revealed word. He says this will be the trumpet, the feast uh the feast the feast be rejected. then their Messiah made known. They'll know their Messiah when they see him. He's coming in power this time, the one they looked for. He's coming in power for the gentile bride. And uh and then uh I I just have some comments here, but I'm going to miss some of those content comments because I want to get between the sixth and seventh trumpet, the messenger of Revelation 10 with the seven thunder voices revealing the seven seals, the two witnesses in Revelation 11, which is Moses and Elijah calling the sealed Jews to the atonement. We're right in this vortex. You say, "Well, why? I I don't you know so much of those things I don't know and I can't keep them in order. Well, you don't really need even if you remember a few lines of what is spoken today. The purpose of this kind of message is when you read or you pondering prayerfully and you're into maybe the seals and the seals brother Brandham said he could never be the same &gt;&gt; the rest of his life &gt;&gt; and I assume that that should have some significance for us. And you'll be thankful next time you're in. You say, "That's what that's what brother Ed was saying. That's a quote he read. Now it comes together. &gt;&gt; That's the purpose of this service, not to have you up dancing in the aisles." So there's a there's the atonement trumpet sound, feast of trumpets and Jesus uh had been put out wouldn't have any cooperation with nobody uh be put out on the outside rejected for uh rejected for it's Christ made manifest among us Jesus among us all made manifest in the purity of his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Make it making it known. What's brother Brandham saying in a leadyian age? So we read it said he was put out. &gt;&gt; He but he lived it. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; And right at the end of his life, not in the first poll, &gt;&gt; not in the second poll, but when the actual voice of the message came out, &gt;&gt; then the door was slammed shut. Yes. &gt;&gt; And when they begin to hear, oh, this is what he believes. He doesn't believe in our trinity. And and remember now, the trinity was the umbilical cord back to mama. &gt;&gt; All the daughters, &gt;&gt; all the daughters &gt;&gt; are tied to Rome &gt;&gt; with a false godhead &gt;&gt; tradition. &gt;&gt; And God cut it for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Some of you that are sitting here, you believe that and you believed it with everything was in you for years and years and years. But when God gave you a revelation of it and you heard that voice, it was cut instantly. &gt;&gt; And it became as clear as clear as crystal for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so now, but in the third pull of his in the last phase of his ministry, the door is slammed shut. And brother Brandon simply says there's no doors open. &gt;&gt; What's he speaking? He's actually speaking the fulfillment of Revelation the third chapter. Jesus standing on the outside. There was his messenger with the with the very word of God. And don't forget the word of God is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is this word made alive in its season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can say, "Well, this is Jesus Christ, but you can't go and build an ark. &gt;&gt; You can't do a whole lot of things. You can go back to Israel. You could go back to the holy sites. You can do all of that. It won't do much for you." but the word in its season &gt;&gt; at this moment &gt;&gt; that God says this is a scripture for now and I'm going to send you a messenger with a voice that's going to point to that scripture and he'll say it in a veiled way and so he'll say uh Jesus is put on the outside who is Jesus it's the word in its season it was put out in Luther's time he was it was put out in Wesley's time Wesley's father I understand had a min was a a minister in in the England, but he couldn't even get behind his pulpit. &gt;&gt; And there was a woman that stood up in the government and declared that every pulpit should be denied to Charles Wesley. &gt;&gt; Why? Not because they didn't like him. It was the word he was speaking. &gt;&gt; And so what that woman was saying, we don't want the second work of grace of of sanctification. All of Europe was saying to Luther, "We don't want justification." &gt;&gt; Think of it. &gt;&gt; We don't want sanctification. &gt;&gt; And they're saying in the last age when he was fully revealed, what the world was crying was this. We don't want Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And the only thing they were in love with was a mental concept. But there when he was made alive, living, vindicated, proven, doing the same things, he said, "We don't want him." &gt;&gt; And that's what they did when he was here on earth. &gt;&gt; He healed him. I I'm just astounded that they that he can heal and do so many miracles in such a confined area. And within a week, they're calling for his blood. &gt;&gt; Last week, they're wanting him to be king. This week they want to crucify him. &gt;&gt; What a fickle thing people are mentally. Goes to show they have that's what tradition will do for you. &gt;&gt; But we don't have tradition. We have a revelation. &gt;&gt; And that's why you're prepared to go through anything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; And then he I I've just abbreviated these things because I must go quickly here. So this is also in the feast of the trumpets. He says, "Now as soon as this church, the bride is drawn together, she she's taken up in that mystery of the seventh seal." &gt;&gt; She's taken up &gt;&gt; in that mystery of the seventh seal &gt;&gt; or the seventh seal, the mystery going. &gt;&gt; He says, and he says, "And the Jews is called to the mystery of the seventh trumpet &gt;&gt; because the trumpets are for them." And he says, which is two prophets, Elijah and Moses, and they come back. He said, Pentecostals is all mixed up. They're looking for something to happen. The church is done, gone, and that's to the Jews. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we don't want to. Now, we've been told, we've been warned, but we don't want to have any lag on, hang on tradition from the past. We don't want a denominational mixture with the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This isn't part message and part &gt;&gt; Pentecost. &gt;&gt; This is the message. &gt;&gt; And he said they're all mixed up. They're looking for something to happen and Christ is done gone. &gt;&gt; Just like the Jews were looking for something to happen and Christ was done gone. He had been there, died, resurrected, ascended up, poured out the Holy Spirit, and they knew nothing about it. &gt;&gt; And they still carried on in their traditions, which exactly the Gentiles are doing the same thing. &gt;&gt; And friends, we haven't just heard a message. We're caught up. &gt;&gt; I'm not doing away with the physical translation, but we're caught up. &gt;&gt; We've heard a voice. How are we caught up? cuz we've heard something. We've heard a voice and we have seen what that messenger is looking at. And I want much more my vision to become clear. &gt;&gt; So now the last sign has been shown. &gt;&gt; The promised son, the word has come. As it was, so is it now. There are so many opinions and questions about him. &gt;&gt; He said, just think of it. It's the end time, folks. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think we can all say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The great day of the Lord is at hand. &gt;&gt; Gather yourselves together. &gt;&gt; In Revelation 11, he said, "Call their ministry will be the ministry of Moses and Elias calling to Israel out of the Jewish traditions." Just as the seventh angel's message called the bride out of the Pentecostal traditions. I say no ministry in our time has caused so much controversy &gt;&gt; has this message &gt;&gt; now he said the last sign that was given could he give me a little more time &gt;&gt; the last sign that Abraham ever seen before the promised son come was what &gt;&gt; God in the form of a human being &gt;&gt; that could discern the thoughts of the people. One man, not a dozen. &gt;&gt; One man, no matter how many impersonations and friends, I can talk about that because I lived in the era of the impersonations. &gt;&gt; And yet, brother Brandham in his kindness called them so sweetly, my brothers. &gt;&gt; My dear brothers. Oh, he's a dear brother. And he spoke so highly of those. But you know, and maybe this some might hear this for the first time, the healing line. That was brother Brandham's ministry. &gt;&gt; Do you know why he called healing lines? Not just to pray for the sick, but so he could take their hand. &gt;&gt; And everybody picked up on it. So then all people start having healing lines but they didn't have like healing lines before. John G Lake for example had healing houses where people would come and they would pray for them and lay hands on them and had wonderful miracles and uh he was in South Africa a lot and had great great ministry in South Africa and outstanding things. So, but the healing line is a part of a one-man ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then all all these others carried on with it. And then he said, "But that was the last sign that they received." &gt;&gt; So now, friends, we're not looking forward for that sign. &gt;&gt; So just say, you know, where we are, where are we at? We're looking back and some of you young people weren't even born when we already had the last sign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we've moved considerable distance from then. And God's clock has continued to tick, &gt;&gt; tick, tick. Has continued to move. Didn't matter. Doesn't matter what people think or what they say or what they look at or what they're teaching or or their opinion or their doctrine. God's clock to say, "Oh, brother Bisco, what would you recommend?" I'm coming to that. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in that time was telling them, "Don't listen to the denomination. Don't listen to your friends. Don't listen to your associates. Don't listen He said, and he said, and he always just said, "The word, the word, the word, the word, the word, my friends, is Jesus Christ, the revealed message in its day." That's the word. That's the word. Th this is the word. But people all over the world have this in their shelves and they they're listening it being preached at from this morning. This is you can get the you can you do you know do you know that all the all the basis of employer employee relationship that that actually is is the foundation for unions it's here in the Bible &gt;&gt; it actually comes out of the out of Moses out of what God told Moses &gt;&gt; how you are the the the social structure how you deal with poverty how you deal with your employer and and what you need to do. That's all here in the Bible &gt;&gt; and its roots. &gt;&gt; And I have read this by non-religious people, but it actually comes out of the scripture. &gt;&gt; It's you can get all kinds of things. We can go into the Psalms and you know it's poetry. We can go into the proverbs and what wisdom there is in the proverbs and we can take nice choice little subjects and go on and speak. It's it's it's excellent. But it's not Jesus Christ to you. &gt;&gt; It's subjects of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; I must move along. I just want you to think now these things I said in this in between time I'd like to give it another terminology things that have happened between the son of man and the son of David. So he said he comes in three sons names. Now that's all in the what we're speaking of. He comes in three sons names. He comes in I'm talking about where are we at? But where was he? He comes in three sons names. One God comes in three sons names. Son of man. That was Jesus Christ on earth. He died, rose, waved over the people, ascended, became the high priest for us could be touched with the feeling of our infirmities. And that he was a son of God because God is a spirit sent the Holy Spirit that we could receive it. As a son of man, he could not be in all the people. That's right. But as a son of God, he can be in the people. &gt;&gt; And that is why he became the wave loaf. So you can eat the loaf. It's one loaf. And so the one loaf goes into many people. &gt;&gt; Is this all right? &gt;&gt; And then at the end of it, he sends Elijah again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To reveal who he is &gt;&gt; because now he's not there in a physical being. He's there. He's there. So now he inhabits. He inhabits a physical being. There he was the son of God born of a holy righteous blood conceived in the womb of a virgin. Now he comes to show his plan is progressing his plan of redemption. So he takes someone born in sin shapen in iniquities and inhabits him to show his continued redemption plan. And he's one that comes to maturity. &gt;&gt; And so, and the word in his mouth is so perfect that what he said in the shalom, and the word the word is once again &gt;&gt; waved over the people. &gt;&gt; So, at the very beginning of the age, he waved the sheep that there's more like me. And at the end, he waved the word again over the people. It's already happened. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So what now? So he comes now after the son of God. There's a breach &gt;&gt; and you can read it in especially in the unveiling of God and he names son of man, son of God, son of David. Son of David is to the Jews in the millennium. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so now he comes a son of man just in a little sliver of time. He said to fulfill the rest of it. Scriptures that Jesus didn't fulfill. Jesus is fulfilling them now in a redeemed vessel. &gt;&gt; Is that clear? &gt;&gt; Maybe these are things that you know. But now now between the son of man and the son of David. If he comes in a breach between the son of God and the son of David comes the son of man. But in his era he's come. God has set him aside has taken him. &gt;&gt; And so we talk about the first pull the sign the hand. That's all history. We're not living there. talked about revealing the secrets of the hearts and and that is I don't belittle that at all. To me that is a vindication. I go back to that all the time. I did this last week many times. This last week these things have been proven. These are vindicated. &gt;&gt; The things that he's speaking would almost be unbelievable. But then God comes behind him and proves it's God speaking. No man can know these things. &gt;&gt; It's God speaking. And so now we're between the son of man. Not between the son of God and son of David. We're between the son of man and son of David. And the one that reveals when I say the son of man. I'm speaking of Christ. And brother Brandham was a son of man revealing the son of man. And so now we're the other side of his physical his physical presence being here. But now, and Christ, listen, Christ wanted him set aside because he didn't want us distracted with the physical person of a prophet standing here. He wants you united with him, Christ, the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so, the bride hasn't only been called out, she's been married. And you already have the ring of predestinated grace put on your finger from before the foundation of the world. And you wouldn't know that without him. &gt;&gt; So God called this bride to himself. Now he says, "Then where are we at, friends? The seals and everything opening. Now, we're getting this uh we're getting this between here. He says, "Now, none of us know, but I'm going to tell you what my revelation is of." He's in the seventh seal. None of us know. But he he said, "The seals and everything opening." Now, he said, "We're getting this in between in in between here." &gt;&gt; And he says, "And I'm going to tell you my revelation." He said, "I've said some things might have been kind of strange to some people." He knows it's strange. He says, "But but when God comes around behind it and vindicates it and says it's the truth, it's not William Brandham saying it's the truth." Because when he's doing something that's beyond human ability, that is God speaking. &gt;&gt; And so the people couldn't hear God's voice. &gt;&gt; And if they couldn't hear his voice, I'm coming to the main part of my message now. And the main part of the message is brother Brandham in the message look. He said when a person says look &gt;&gt; he said then he said there's a voice &gt;&gt; that is saying look &gt;&gt; l o o k &gt;&gt; and he says then then it is what is that person saying &gt;&gt; and so now I'm coming to the heart of the message what was that prophet saying these things sound strange it was strange for him how could he even begin to explain what he was seeing he's seeing things in another realm. &gt;&gt; How could he say it? He says, "I'm in another world." How could he explain that world? You can't explain this one. &gt;&gt; I'm in another world. &gt;&gt; I'm in two places at the same time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How could he tell that eternal realm? &gt;&gt; But now he's told us, I'm the messenger. &gt;&gt; This is a message of Elijah. &gt;&gt; This is the prophet of Malachi. This is the revealing of Luke 17:30, which is Jesus Christ. This is him and he is the word. So he says it thousands of times. He's the word. He's the word. He's the word. And he's proving also what's coming out of his mouth is the vindicated word. &gt;&gt; God coming behind it saying it's not him speaking. It's me speaking. &gt;&gt; And now he's saying to the people, look at this. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Even the angels didn't know anything about it. &gt;&gt; But it's in this in between time. It's in this in between time. And just stay with me now this next few minutes because it's going to take just a little bit. But it's in this in between time. I've said all of what I've said from the beginning to let you know we're we're between the son of ma the revealing of the son of man not between the son of god and the son of David but the revealing of the son of man &gt;&gt; and it was in one pole two pull second pole and then the third pole was actually the word itself but the word itself ends up with the opening of the seals and a short period of time after that &gt;&gt; and it's really amazing Amen. &gt;&gt; This might mean something to you. Jesus lived for 33 years &gt;&gt; on earth &gt;&gt; and was crucified &gt;&gt; and ascended. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's ministry was for 33 years. &gt;&gt; And Jesus ministered actually with a physical ministry for three and a half years. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham here he is ministering to the populations in the thousands, tens of thousands for 30 years. And then God tells him, &gt;&gt; "Stop it. &gt;&gt; Now I want you to reveal the secret of my heart &gt;&gt; and gives him three and a half years." &gt;&gt; You'd think he'd You think God would give him 30 years to minister the secret of God's heart. But no, he draws the people and he tells them he's fishing. &gt;&gt; And the angel of the Lord even told him, "I'll show you. I'll teach you how to fish." &gt;&gt; And he's attracting all these people. And he got all kinds of impersonations. &gt;&gt; And he told him now when the third pole, you will not speak of it. &gt;&gt; He said the angel even even uh I won't say rebuked him but spoke to him very sternly got you got your line all messed up. You got all this tangle by trying to explain it to the people. And so he said he will not explain this. &gt;&gt; And the reason he can't explain it is because God held it as a secret. Amen. &gt;&gt; That nobody knew because it's the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Friends, we're right in that season. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We're in the season that the ancients, the prophets and seers desired to see. We're in that season. &gt;&gt; No wonder the things are going on that are going on in the world. No wonder technology is going. No wonder Hollywood is going the way it is. No wonder there's such filth everywhere. No wonder Satan comes against the believers with such a force is because we're right in that season. And I would that every believer would know we're in that time and that God has held us a secret from the eternities to this moment when you and I, little worms of the earth, &gt;&gt; he's given us this great privilege. &gt;&gt; I would say to you, &gt;&gt; don't get caught by looking at just everything else that's around us. &gt;&gt; So Christ was once offered and unto them &gt;&gt; and I trust we are them &gt;&gt; that look for him. Look for him. Who is he? He is the revealed word of God. &gt;&gt; He is the portion of this word for this hour that is him &gt;&gt; and for them that look for him. look for him. For them and them alone that look for him the revealed work shall he appear to them the second time without sin. The first time he came and took your sin and my sin. This time there is no sin. There isn't even a trace of sin without sin unto redemption because it's complete. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Unto them. &gt;&gt; You want to be able to say and declare it whether you feel it or not. I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; One of them. Oh, I can say I'm one of them. and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There's people even that declare the message and declare themselves to be believers and you can say exactly what Jesus Christ spoke through his mouth and they will not accept it &gt;&gt; because it doesn't agree with their opinion. It doesn't agree with their decision or their tradition or whatever it is. I tell you, unto them that look for him, and only him shall he appear the second time. [Applause] [Music] You can just stay rejoicing &gt;&gt; all you want. &gt;&gt; This is out of the &gt;&gt; unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation. Unto them that look for him the revealed word. We have the whole body of revealed word is here. You have it. And there's no excuse not to look at that. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine all the things that flies by our ears, your ears, someone else's ears? If you hear that voice, you cannot do that and look at him. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Because it's this voice and this voice alone that's looking at the he's looking at the physical thing in another realm. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham gives it all kinds of all kinds of examples. I would love for you to even hear that message if you haven't heard it already. Look in 1963. &gt;&gt; You want to hear that? &gt;&gt; And he said in there just some of the things before I go on. He said that uh he uh Billy had gotten a camera and so he was looking through the camera. &gt;&gt; He was looking at a big saro cactus, I believe it is. And uh before he got the camera, he saw one. And he put the camera up, he saw three. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Well, there's what's wrong?" He said, "There's three." No. He said, "Daddy, you have to focus it." &gt;&gt; He says, "When I focused it in, then I just saw one. Amen. And he's speaking to a whole crew of trinitarians and he took that one little thing and made &gt;&gt; gave him the word out of it. &gt;&gt; He said, "You just need to focus it." Then he turned to the believers and he gave us a message. He said, "You got to focus out everything else and focus only on the word that's been revealed." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My brother, my sister, don't forget this message &gt;&gt; focus. I don't care what you have heard or what you are going to hear or what what what circumstances you have faced. This revealed word will be the same every time. &gt;&gt; It will not change. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you hear the word, now these are all straight quotes. When you hear the word, it's usually somebody to get you to look what they are looking at. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They say to you, look. Amen. &gt;&gt; And what the messenger was saying and is saying to us, &gt;&gt; he's saying, "Look, &gt;&gt; try to see what I'm looking at." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said like going down the road, someone might see a certain scene and they'd say, "Look." And then express what it is. &gt;&gt; But the first thing to get your attention is is is look. &gt;&gt; Because the messenger was trying to get the people to see what he's looking at. He said it depends on what the voice is trying to tell you to look for &gt;&gt; in this hour &gt;&gt; at this point of your life and in this junction I say when you hear anything you want to ask what is it they're trying to get me to look at &gt;&gt; and they can take the word the message of the hour and saying, "Oh, this is what I'm trying to get you to see. Look, read this. This is the revelation of Jesus Christ." But some, they use this word. &gt;&gt; And the prophet even says they they esteem themselves. They put themselves up on a pedestal. They make ministries. And he said they're not drawing people to Christ, who's the revealed word. They're drawing people to themselves or to their church. I tell you what, friends, even from the very beginning when we were in a house and had about eight people in the house and uh and and uh uh you know that we'd see some come, we'd see some go and and just a handful of people and then the the place got full of people and we had go into the log church and all the rest of it. I've always had one quiet confidence. The bridegroom knows those that are his &gt;&gt; and he will lose none of them. Hallelujah. And for the bride of Jesus Christ, don't ever mistake me. People that aren't worshiping and fellowshipping in this physical structure today and our dear brothers and sisters of ours, whether they're across the sea in the Congo or whether across the city or in another place in Abbottzford or wherever they are. I tell you what, friends, I never have questioned the the scripture, the revealed scripture. And it's the prophet that made it so clear. He he and he takes it right out of the scripture. So this becomes a living book to me. Says all that the father hath given me will come. &gt;&gt; And I will lose none of them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will lose none of them. He didn't ask me go and be distressed. Go and have great doubts. Go and be in confusion. I say to this congregation rest. I say this congregation at all, be at peace. Peace. Peace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I would say that to anyone that was even doubting their salvation. And I know they're a son of God. Be at peace. Be at rest. &gt;&gt; God is not in the business of losing his children. We give him praise. We give him praise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelu. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise be to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I trust your feeding. &gt;&gt; He says the church is looking for more members, but the bride is looking for the coming of her Lord. We're all looking. He said, &gt;&gt; "You've got to see something before you can tell somebody else to look at what you're seeing." &gt;&gt; He says, "By faith, Noah saw. He saw the floods. &gt;&gt; He saw the waters of God's judgment coming down. Noah had an experience of this by faith. He saw the coming of the flood. A great rain that was going to cover. He saw it. While he preached, he saw water. &gt;&gt; While he preached, he saw the earth being judged. &gt;&gt; And the rain was going to cover the earth and take all of the wash off the earth, the redemption, rededication to God. But the preaching of Noah brought justification. And God baptized the earth with water. We didn't know until this messenger came that God was justifying the earth &gt;&gt; and putting it through the process of redemption. We didn't know it till we heard this voice. &gt;&gt; Then along came the son and dropped his blood upon it to sanctify it, to claim it for his own. We didn't know that &gt;&gt; until this voice came and now it's baptism of fire. cleanse us from all germs, all diseases, all sicknesses, even all the spiritual things to make it ready for God to dwell in. He said in this great age that's to come, the new earth, he justified it in the future home, he said he justified a man, sanctified him, sent the Holy Ghost and fire and burnt the sin out of him and dwelt in him himself. &gt;&gt; He does the same. He does the earth the same that he's going to use in the plan of redemption. The same way &gt;&gt; we didn't know. We all heard about Noah and the flood and all the animals going into the ark since we were children. &gt;&gt; We didn't know God was justifying the earth, &gt;&gt; bring it through a process of making a justification. &gt;&gt; We didn't know when the blood dropped down. And I've heard so many songs of the cross and the suffering of Jesus. Never once did I hear till Elijah spoke it &gt;&gt; that God was through that blood was claiming the earth as his own. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now the process he's brought you through, you actually bypassed the earth in its process. It hasn't received its baptism of fire, but you have. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You're justified. &gt;&gt; Sanctified by the blood &gt;&gt; and baptized with the holy fire of almighty God. &gt;&gt; It repented and was baptized in water by Noah. Jesus came and sanctified it by dripping his blood upon it and claimed it. And in the new earth that's to come, it's to have a holy fire baptism to clean it uh of every devil, every germ, every sickness, everything. I say, "Oh God, oh God, let every devil be passed away in that holy fire of almighty God." And there make a new I saw a new heaven and a new earth. And God here by the writer in the message look &gt;&gt; bear with me just another few moments &gt;&gt; by the writer who is the apostle Paul I believe uh in Hebrews yes and he's inviting us to view this to look at it we look for Christ the second time &gt;&gt; we see him not as he was &gt;&gt; we see him as he is &gt;&gt; and we and we know that the word is Christ. Therefore, it's the word that we look to then for it's the expression of what God is. &gt;&gt; When God came in Christ, he was the expression of what God was. &gt;&gt; The light of the body is the eye. Matthew says, "And if therefore thine eye be what? &gt;&gt; Single." &gt;&gt; Say it again. &gt;&gt; Single. &gt;&gt; Not double, not triple, but single. My eye is not adjusted to everything around me that makes my life all blurry and adds confusion. He didn't come to confuse. Don't get caught up in anything even of your workplace or your your associates or your friends or your family or whoever. Amen. &gt;&gt; I might be no stick in the mud, but even as a young person, even as a young person, I believe before I actually was born again, no, I I I had friends in the world and I could only associate with them thus far and no further. &gt;&gt; I could not go where they wanted to go. I could not do what they want to do even without there was something holding me back. I just couldn't do it. And so whatever they were looking at and attracted to, thank God he blinded me. &gt;&gt; I just couldn't see it. When your mind and eyes can be singled to that word and focus that in till you see exactly what God is doing. Friends, I'm down now to the final. I'm in the last lap of this message and this is saying it all. When your mind and eyes can be single to that word, I'm talking about that word. If you folks and some maybe rarely ever pick up a message book, to me it's the wisdom of God. &gt;&gt; To me, it's the word of this hour. To me, it is the answer to all life's questions. &gt;&gt; Is that word &gt;&gt; we must focus our lives not what somebody else says but focus our lives to him &gt;&gt; and he is the word. If we get out if we get our lives lined with the word then the word and our life becomes the same. &gt;&gt; Watch this now. And Abraham did such a thing. And 25 years later, we find him still believing the same promise. Why? He had focused &gt;&gt; his mind to the will of God by the word of God and believed it. &gt;&gt; If we can focus ourself to the plan of God. What is the plan of God? You think God would send Elijah here without giving us the plan of God? &gt;&gt; We have the plan of God. &gt;&gt; We need to focus on that plan. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it will never stray from this word. &gt;&gt; He says, "Focus to the plan of God, to what God wants for us and what God promised us and let everything else alone and let everything else alone. &gt;&gt; No matter how long it is, &gt;&gt; just keep believing. &gt;&gt; But focus out of you." Now, he not only focus in, &gt;&gt; but he's telling you to focus out. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Focus out of you all doubt. &gt;&gt; Look only to that word. It It promised it. &gt;&gt; God said it. It's got to be that way. &gt;&gt; The same Holy Spirit, listen so close now. The same Holy Spirit that wrote this Bible will focus it right back into you again. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I believe &gt;&gt; this is the same messenger &gt;&gt; that maybe in a few moments will call people and God Almighty will come directly behind him so that you and I will know this is God speaking to us. &gt;&gt; This is not a man. It's God speaking. And he's saying that if the same Holy Spirit that wrote the Bible, if we'll focus, if we will focus on it, that then that that that spirit that wrote the Bible will focus it right back into you again. Only God himself can take a hold of the camera of your eyes. What a statement. And let you see what God is &gt;&gt; and what his purpose is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say, "Oh God, Take the camera my eyes and let me see only the word for this hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Would you like to stand? &gt;&gt; There are people almost everywhere. &gt;&gt; Whose hearts are all a flame. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, sometime we have a song leader, sometime we don't. But we've got so many song leaders out there. [Music] &gt;&gt; I got a little course, but I can't sing it for you right now. Is that in focus? [Music] I got a little course. I didn't get a chance to be with brother Ryan, but I'm It is just so simple, but I I just began singing to myself yesterday and I sang and wept and sang. &gt;&gt; He was born to be my savior. &gt;&gt; He was born to be my king. &gt;&gt; He was born to be my kinsman. And he was born to reign within. &gt;&gt; I was born without a savior &gt;&gt; in a world so dark and sin. But I was born to walk with Jesus. &gt;&gt; And I was born to reign with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; All right, let's just sing it there. One of them. One of them. We'll sing a verse or two of it. &gt;&gt; There are people everywhere. [Music] I'm baptized in Jesus name. [Music] I'm so glad that I can say I want to I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. Hallelujah. One of them. Praise God. I'm so glad that I can say I'm going to fail. Though these people may not let it be worthy, they all receive their page baptized in Jesus name. And I'm telling now both far and wide his power is yet the same. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I [Music] praise God. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. Praise God. I'm so glad that I can sing. I'm one of them. Just before we sing this last verse, of course, I'm going to ask our brother Victor Adamore if you'll come and pray a prayer or a blessing over the people. When you do that, please. Amen. The next verse. They were gathered in the upper room. All praise in his name. They were baptized with the Holy Ghost. God for service came. Now what he did for them that day, he'll do for you the same. I'm so glad that I can't say I'm going out there. I'm going to praise God. I'm so glad that I can say I want to live. I want to say hallelujah. One of them. Praise God. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of one of them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. I'm one of them. Hallelujah. One of them. I'm so glad that I can sing. I'm one of them. [Applause] Our brother Victor is going to pray. [Music] Brother Victor, I don't think he probably wants me to say this, but he has sacrificed very very much to fellowship with us, to fellowship with you. He's an accomplished engineer for the Shell Oil Company in Nigeria. And he wanted his family to be here and worship some years ago. and he and his dear wife Sister Victoria and children have been separated for months at a time. And brother Victor, that has been such a uh something I pondered so much and I thought of the great sacrifice that you and your wife have made. Brother David and Sam who's up in Edmonton studying and he's he's he's left the position. Oh, they would allow him to be maybe in New York or Toronto or Montreal or someplace. He said, "But no, I want to be here." And I can hear a man like that pray. &gt;&gt; And I can assure you he's not looking at position. I can assure you he's not looking at his salary &gt;&gt; because he wouldn't be here if he was looking at his salary. [Music] I believe you focused in brother long time ago and he's had such a burden for the people over Nigeria and different places in Africa and is working with brother Kim to get message hubs over there. So you just see someone sitting here you never get maybe even shake hands with them. know maybe little or nothing about him. And we're not lifting a person up. I'm just saying the people of the scripture still live today. &gt;&gt; And they left all and followed him. I say, God bless you, brother Victor. And please pray a prayer of blessing upon our people. Amen. [Music] Hallelujah. I'm so excited. And uh it's wonderful, isn't it? &gt;&gt; I think that's what our hearts want. We want want to see Jesus. I want to see God's word made flesh. And uh and uh I don't want to say too much. Uh I I think I'm so true this morning and uh this afternoon and uh it's wonderful and I think that's what I look for. That's what I desire my life. If I since I give my life to Jesus, I want to see &gt;&gt; uh Christ made manifest &gt;&gt; and um uh I also see God answering our prayers and uh coming down in such a simple humble way to make himself known to us of what he's doing and what he's telling us. Uh I think it's exciting time for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I I know that we have a lot more to see, a lot more to hear him say to us with such a starting time to us. And that's that's why, you know, um our enemy, the devil, the pastor is not happy at all. So So we we know he's he's not happy at all. He fights you at home, fights you at school, well trying to get you out of focus. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you're focused in uh this is the time that you you get stronger. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I I I'm certainly there's a testimony in my heart that God has made me stronger and I and I've I've prayed more than I prayed before and uh and I think that's what he wants us to do with all the distractions and all the trials and that we have gone through. I'm not going to speak for you but I I'm going through the same trials as well. But he's he's making us to focus more. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh it's so wonderful. And uh I I I I can't speak too much. I think I I I don't have the words to say it. But um but the Lord knows all. He's he he he knows your heart and uh and uh he's a faithful God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if we just pray for a while. Heavenly Father, what a day that you have ordained Lord Jesus for your people. to gather in your presence. And how Lord uh sometimes I imagine when you preach to the people when you had you took flesh and walk the shores of Palestine preaching uh kingdom of God. Lord, how I can imagine it in history and then come back in reality in my day and see the same word, the same voice and uttering out and speaking to me, you know, in such a way that I have no single doubt that it's you. Yes. &gt;&gt; So this afternoon we we we have we have uh shouted and screamed and praised your name and we have been excited as well how how you have open the this precious word father especially how you have anointed our brother brother Ed Lord um anointed his heart to try to bring it out Lord in in in words of men uh the Holy Spirit taking those words &gt;&gt; deepseated in his heart as revealed to him Lord and we have been dealing with him father in so many ways and trying to bring it out in plain words that we can understand. Father we thank you for your grace upon every one of us. We thank you for your mighty presence here this afternoon. We thank you Lord for the great things you have opened our eyes to see and above all the your mercy that's uh warning us and making us to focus out everything that's contrary to your word &gt;&gt; and to focusing onto your unchanging word. We know Lord that word cannot fail and because he promised it Lord you're you're a faithful God and you keep that promise. So we thank you this afternoon Lord. We thank you for our dear pastor Lord and it's such an exciting thing to to hear gracious words come out father and it's not we we can't find it in the world we can't buy with money we can't uh get it out of our own ideas or thinking but we know it's you that is visiting us in this time Lord to make yourself known we we're so thankful father we thank you for the grace you've granted us to be here Lord as we want to go home now we commit uh ourselves us into your hands, Lord, and ask that you will take us home, Lord. May may these words that we heard the voice, oh, Father, what a revelation this afternoon. May the voice go with us, Lord, and and pull us to yourself and and pull us closer to yourself, Father. May the voice constrain us as we work, as we go home, Lord, everyone here, Lord. I pray that your blessing will go with us, Father, as we go home. And may you bring us again as we gather in the evening, Father. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Victor. God bless you. Amen. God bless you once again. Amen. All right. We are dismissing you in the name of Jesus Christ. And those you that are going to have your dinner with the Cochmans, you've got 35 minutes. It's about a 15-minute drive over to Newand's. And uh I hope someone knows how to get you there, Brother Cochman. Uh, so don't don't give him your life story. If you shake hands, that's fine. But we'll let brother and sister Cochman and uh Ben. All right. Benjamin and his wife. I think it's Melissa. Is it? All right. See you there. And we'll let you slip out and you can go to the door so you can get away and and uh and those of you that are having lunch, you've got a good time, but don't linger around. and uh greet all the saints there. Be real friendly and see you this evening, Lord willing. Uh, Brother Tom is ministering tonight and uh we always get a load. Amen. We get inspired. So, God bless you. You're dismissed.
