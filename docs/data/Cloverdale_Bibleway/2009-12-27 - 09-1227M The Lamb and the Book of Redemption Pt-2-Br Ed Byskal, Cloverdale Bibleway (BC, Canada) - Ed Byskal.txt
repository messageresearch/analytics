[Music] Hallelujah. I'm going to ask brother Alex or dileier if you'd come, brother Alex, and open the service in a word of prayer. Sister Lori writes in a testimony. She wants to thank the Lord Jesus for a physical healing and signs of a spiritual healing in progress after the ministry prayed for her daughter Christine and grandson Joshua. So we thank the Lord for that. Rejoice with Sister Lori. If you have a need on your heart as we go to prayer this morning, just lift it up before the Lord. Those that are sick and body, those on the internet hookup that couldn't be with us this morning, may the Lord Jesus touch you right where you are this morning. And brother Alex, why don't you come? If you have a need, just make it known by the uplifted hand as we go to prayer. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. &gt;&gt; Precious heavenly father, it's privilege this morning to be here in the house of God, the house of worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord, for we know that we're going to hear from God this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh God, this is so wonderful. This is not just a man that's going to come here, Lord. It's you that going to speak to us, Lord Jesus. As I was reading this morning, Lord, the bridge, oh my father, thank you. I ask you, Lord, that you give understanding to each one in the presence of God this morning. Help us, Lord, to understand what you have done for us, to take a hold of it, Lord Jesus, to really have the revelation in our soul and put us into action, Lord Jesus. Oh heavenly father have mercy upon us. Help us Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord let the man of God come forth Lord. I can even say let the lamp come forth this morning Lord through the vessel of brother Elis. &gt;&gt; And he's going to speak to us the words of life. We can receive it into our soul. &gt;&gt; Help us Lord. We commit this gathering to you Lord. Lead us and guide us Lord. Have the preeminence in our lives. Help us Lord to overcome in this evil day. We commit this day into your hands now the preaching of the word. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. You may have your seats. So good to so good to have everyone here this morning. We're going to have our Sunday school come and bless us with a little song this morning. So why don't they come on in there Sunday school? God bless you all the parents that are represented here. Give you thanks for each one of their lives and trust that the Lord deals with them at an early age. May this be a testimony this morning. Brother Tom, did you want to come and make an announcement? &gt;&gt; God bless you and good morning. Looking forward to a wonderful watch night service on Thursday night. There won't be a Wednesday service, of course. We'll have that on Thursday. Brother Biscll has uh got a direction that we're going to be going. So, it's going to be a wonderful time and um there's been a request that those that would like to have a special ready to meet right after the uh service in the chapel. Um we're going to uh be more orientated towards uh a mission direction. I'm sure brother Bisco will uh fill you in on that. But we will be filling in with different songs and specials through the night and some we'll be able to use and some we'll will hold off into the uh following year. So if you're willing to be able to put your name forward and have something ready for us, that's what we're desiring. So God bless you. And again, they're meeting right after the service in the chapel. We follow the star, rejoice in his day. Walk in his light and we can't be the same. We give in our substance and all that we are. We lay down our lives and we follow the stars. East and song to place where they knew the Savior was born. We sing his life. They boldly proclaim. We come to worship his name. We follow the star, rejoice in his name, walk in his light, and we can't be the same. We give it ourselves and all that we are. We lay down our lives and we follow the stars. In the time of the evening, there shall be a light. The whole world is croping, searching for life. So the message has come. Its voice has been heard. And we have returned to the world. We follow the star, rejoice in his name, walk in his light and we can't be the same. We give it our substance and all that we are. We lay down our lives and we follow the star. Let us do. Let us do life. Let us do our place in the body of Christ. led us to healing and peace in our hearts. This time he's leading us all. We follow the star. Rejoice in his name. Walk in his light and we can't be the same. We give in our justice and all that we are. We lay down our lives and we follow the star. We follow the star, rejoice in his name, walk in his light, and we can't be the same. We give it our substance in all that we are. We lay down our lives, and we follow the star. We give it our substance in all that we are. We lay down our lives and we follow the star. We lay down our lives and we follow the star. [Music] Aren't they beautiful? &gt;&gt; You better give them another hand. Wonderful. Wonderful jewels. &gt;&gt; If you can receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. These are the jewels. God bless you children. Thank you so much for singing. We certainly certainly appreciate that. Well, one day we're all going to get to heaven and we won't be necessarily little children, but in order to get there, we must be children at heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. When the redeemed are gathering in, there's a rapture that comes after all of this. &gt;&gt; Job had a vision of the resurrection sitting on his ash heap, no matter how bad it gets. We trust that you get that resurrection vision. Amen. No matter how tough the times come, brother Brennham used to say, "No matter how dark the night, you just call me and I'll be there." And I believe that that's the heart of the Lord Jesus. Let's sing this together as we get ready to turn the service to brother Ed. I think it's a rejoicing time, friends. Somebody got after me the other day for singing an Easter song on Christmas Day. I said, "Well, they're tied together. The birth of a child speaks of a resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing it together, shall we? I am thinking of a rapture in our blessing on high in the sky. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Heat. There will be a great procession over all music singing for city. [Music] [Music] I shall see when the redee [Music] with their voice is clear and strong. When the redee are gathering in then the angels all listen for they cannot join that song when we Yeah. Heat. [Music] We will have there when we did our then the Savior to prepare the banquet when we need our gathering in and we'll hear the invitation of Jesus. Heat. Heat. [Applause] Watch my soul. I will shout and I will sing with you. [Music] Let's all put our hands together now. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Let's [Music] all get [Music] [Applause] [Music] Yeah. When the redeemer [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. That ought to make anybody happy. &gt;&gt; One of my favorite songs. Amen. Well, you may be seated. I'm just going to take a couple of minutes here before we read the word. Uh, want to thank you all for [Music] being here. If you weren't here, we'd have no one to preach to. So, that would be a sad thing, wouldn't it? And uh this is a time, you know, we're coming to the end of this year 209. It's uh I think it's 44 years. Uh Brother Brandham's passing the other day on the 24th. 44 years. And uh well that's like a double deliverance for supposed to be deliverance. So it's a great time that we have come to and every time I hear brother Brandham come to the end of a year and look forward to the next year always says we're looking forward to a great things looking forward to less but looking forward to greater things. &gt;&gt; And I think that's the way we ought to be. I'm here to do my very best. I believe uh musicians uh everyone else I believe you're here to do your very best. We ought to make a we don't make resolutions. We ought to make a resolve that we are prepared to rally to do more. We're prepared to pull our strength and all of our resources together to do more for God. Uh, we don't know how much time we have. Well, one thing is sure, you're going to cross over. &gt;&gt; I'm going to cross over. And then our labors are done. &gt;&gt; I'm sure every one of us want to do everything we can while we have breath, while we have strength, while we have our mental uh capacity and and faculties. We want to do everything we can, do we not? &gt;&gt; Amen. you join with me on that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything that we can. And so we're in a a marvelous hour, friends. Uh uh God has sent us a message that is just the rarest the rarest and most wonderful thing. It's not just mentally intoxicating. That's not what I'm talking about. It's something that physically does something to you physically. And it's moving. If you will allow it, it will move you and take you into another place. And that's kind of I have to be careful. I will be starting to invade on my service. On Thursday evening, we're going to start at 9:00 and we have uh uh I just felt that this year maybe we'll do something just a wee bit different. part of it. You know, our our congregation has been so blessed with so many different uh uh groups, ethnic groups from different parts of the country and the world. And I just thought, you know, we should have some of these uh sing two or three pieces for us. I thought of having the uh Africa represented. We have the congalles people and let them come and some might say, "Oh, I don't sing." Well, we won't know any difference. There are some that do sing and they sing wonderfully. Uh I've spoken to sister Okeello and I think brother Gilbert is here has arrived and we want them to sing. Uh, I enjoyed our sister Lois when she sang, but but she she can sing al also, I'm sure, in her in her Kenyan language as well. The whole family, and I think that would be nice. We have Russian people are here. Uh, we have Spanish people that are here. And, uh, I think we might as you know what the Bible says, the tribes and the nations and the tongues. So, we'll hear them sing in tongues. &gt;&gt; The Chinese, we've got them all lined up. And we might even have some English. I think that'll be great. And uh I've kind of put the finger on our brother Nathan and sister Corin. We've had Nathan up and sing lots of time, but Sister Corin and she she let me know that he even he even knows a few courses in in in Cree. So, we'll have maybe some of the native uh I could even sing a a course in in a native tongue, but not very good. So, I would need a lot of people to cover up for me. Uh so that'll be Thursday evening and some testimony and it's going to be a wonderful evening of fellowship and and and worship. Uh brother and sister Codle have called and they wanted to be remembered to you. They're with some family members in in Florida and they said uh that they want to extend their greetings to the congregation. They miss being with you and they expect to be back about May. Brother Billy Ler, who I don't think uh very few of you know at least. Brother Billy and I have been very dear friends since about in the 1970s. And he just keeps calling oh all the time on a regular basis. And he and about 14 others went down to Jamaica just got back. And I don't know if you've heard on the news that one American Airlines plane uh that overshot the runway a wee bit and I understand broke into three pieces. Well, it it it just happened one day before they were coming back to United States and uh uh but they were coming from a different I believe that happened at at Kingston, Jamaica, and they were flying in and out of Montego Bay. Uh but we're always happy when uh people they weren't down there for vacation, they were down there with brother Reed. Some of you may have met Brother Reed during the 207 convention because he was here uh from from Jamaica and and uh uh really a lovely brother. So they know him and they went down there and I believe that brother Brad, their pastor, took a service. There was about 15 of them all together. But he's he's burdened for India. I didn't get a chance to tell you, brother Kim, but he wants to put another print station in India, and he has a specific brother that he wants to uh send it to. So, they just keep uh going all the time. I'm hoping that we can have for this next year a big map and maybe a whole hub print area right in the in the foyer there. It's uh it's a just a it's such a wonderful thing, friends. I am so enthused and happy about that. I I can't describe to you. I guess maybe it comes from being in so many places and having people look into your face and I know that I got red volumes and there's brother Mless's brown volumes and I got MP3s and you've got every kind. You've got it in every format possible. I've got individual books. I've got some printed, most of them printed by spoken word, then voice of God, and then and then brother Harold Hilderbrand filled in for those that were you couldn't get anymore. And I've had people here and even of our own congregation as as they were getting saved and coming and says they'd see my Hebrew series and says, "Where can I get a Hebrew series?" I'm sorry, you can't get a Hebrew series. They're they're been out out of circulation for a long time. And uh and and then people I've been over in other countries and had them look with their dark lovely sparkling eyes and and just where can I can I get a book? I've I've been with people where the message was written on brown paper bags and translated. I have Russian messages that have been written by hand. I've been in a brother Joseph's home or in a home with him in Romania where he had the pieces of of the paper translated and slipped under a double floor in a rabbit cage. And you know all you have to do and that's just in the short period of time of my lifetime friends. And then to to find it that you have it. And people today, they can just they can either get it by by a disc or have it and and bring it down out of the skies. And people today, I mean, they're excited. If Brother Kim was up here, he'd just tell you. And the Spanish-sp speakaking peoples of Central and South America, they are they are outstripping the even the English speakaking about 6,000. What is it per month downloads? 6,000 downloads a month and it's just in in uh incredible. It's hard to fathom. So, I just say praise be to God. &gt;&gt; And that's not our doing. We're just behind it. Anybody's got a computer. Anybody can go to uh any store and buy a HP printer. It's not just a bunch of mechanics, friends. It is that a person can finally get a message in their hand and begin to read things that they've never heard before. &gt;&gt; How many of you read the messages? You read things that you wonder if you even read it before. You read the seals again. I just had uh brother Milco because I said last last uh service, read the breach. He said, I read the breach. It was just like it was all new to me. I want to thank you for having us read the breach. Amen. Hallelujah. Well, let's stand before I start preaching. Thank you, brother Ryan. Joanne, musicians. And just before we open the word, we're going to read in Hebrews. But before we do, let's just talk to the author. Gracious and lovely, lovely Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; you are lovely. Your spirit is so warm and welcoming &gt;&gt; and we want to welcome you. Welcome. Welcome, Holy Ghost. We welcome thee. Lord, &gt;&gt; how beloved and how lovely you are, Lord, to us. &gt;&gt; You've carried us through another year. &gt;&gt; You have fed us. &gt;&gt; You've led us. You've opened your word. You sent your presence to us. You lifted us up when we were heavy. When our hearts were heavy, Lord, you lifted us up, oh God, when we were in a state of indecision, perhaps didn't know just exactly what to do. You were there for the for us each one. You have led us as a as a great shepherd. And how we thank you for that, Lord. Oh, how wonderful you are today, Lord. I know that you'll come again. Your Holy Spirit will come to each one that is here. Help, I pray, the people so that they will be not only thankful, but they will be keen to hear what you have for them. Perhaps it's just a sentence or just a few words in the in the oncoming service. Help me to say what I'm supposed to say, Lord. I put a put a seal upon my lips. I will not say anything that should not be spoken. I pray, oh God, you'll forgive us our transgressions and forgive us anything that has been done that we've done wrong. Oh God, forgive us, oh Lord Jesus, for our frailties and our weaknesses. And I pray that you'll strengthen us and fill our hearts with strength and courage. And I ask, oh God, that we may move forward, oh Lord, in this glorious hour in the name of Jesus Christ for your anointing. Now we pray. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh I'm going to read out of Hebrews the third chapter and we'll just read the last uh two verses uh verse 18 and 19. Have to be a little bit patient with me. I've I've got a new Bible. I've had the Bible for a long time, but uh I have I have such a hard time letting go of my old Bibles and uh so I just have a new one and and struggle around with it. But I always buy the same Bible. I was carrying it one day and Brother Bram says, "Oh," he said, "I see that you have a Scoffield Bible." Oh, yeah. I said that I have a Scullfield. He said, "I I kind of like old Dr. Scoffield." He said, "I carry exactly the same Bible. It made me feel better." All right. Uh verse 18 and 19. And to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believe not. So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. We'll carry on with chapter 4. Let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it. For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them. But the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. So the gospel was fine and the preaching was fine. We assume that. But they couldn't enter into this rest, into his rest, into this certain place because of their unbelief. And it was not mixed with faith. For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, as I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest, although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise. And God did rest the seventh day from all his works. And in this place again, if they shall enter into my rest, seeing therefore it remainth that some must enter therein. And they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief. Again he limitth a certain day, saying in David, today after so long a time, as it is said, Today if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. For if Jesus, and that is Joshua, had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day, there remainth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall uh fall after the same example of unbelief. Now notice verse 12, how almost out of context it is. For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing aunderder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. God bless the word and each of you as you have your seats. And I'll ask for your undivided attention and really be as focused as possible and ask God to give you uh spiritual understanding. Sometimes it seems uh you know for a minister you start to you get into areas that are uh even for myself as familiar as I am with the message and the scripture and all these years yet sometime you begin to feel that you're almost being overwhelmed not almost but are overwhelmed. So if you don't understand everything, don't don't shut your mind off. Just uh open up and say, "Well, it might be tomorrow or the next week or whatever, but I I need this because the Holy Spirit will bring it back to your remembrance." &gt;&gt; Now the scripture, I just want to make some statements first here. The scriptures are uh a multi-layered in their meaning. Brother Brandham uses the word compound. The same thing will have compound meaning. It'll also have references. It could have references to those in the Old Testament and those in the New Testament. Uh and so the the meanings are layered. If you were to take uh the descriptions of Jesus Christ for example, and I know that you'll readily accept there's many many descriptions of him, you know, he's the anointed one, he's the blessed one, he's the root, he's the branch, he's the son of man, he's the son of David, he's the son of God, he's uh all of these things. He's the judge. He's the he's the savior. He's the redeemer. He's the healer. And you can go on and on. And I have a h I have a long list that has been accumulated which I wouldn't have time to read this morning which starts at A and ends at Z. And it's just an incredible probably uh probably maybe close to a hundred descriptions of Jesus Christ. And then it goes on to the believer and to the bride of Christ and all of the things. So it's multi-layered and and and there are different phrases in the scripture which which brother Brandham says you have to see Christ in every verse. And I know I I sometimes take that in fact as I often do and read that and I know what he said and I think now now where's Christ in that? It's good for us to be uh to to be inquisitive as children &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, you know, just I'm I'm willing to learn. I want to hear. I want to know. I want to be benefited. I don't want to remember. I don't want to remain in some cloud or some fog. Let my mind not be clouded up with this world. Let me be just as clear and focused as I can on these things." &gt;&gt; Amen. So now the scripture here is speaking so much of rest and then it drops down and says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. It's very very interesting to realize that that scripture is one I would say perhaps the second most uh used of brother Brham regarding his own ministry. And now let's just take that for a moment. So I here's where I have to, you know, h really have you thinking with me. So now, brother Brandham is coming in a first pull of his ministry and it it's in in healing and and those things which he says is a minor thing but nevertheless God found it was necessary sending the spirit of Elijah to the people to catch their attention. And so he takes that revealing the secret of their heart and he said would it help you to believe? That's the key. Would it help you to believe if I told you your name or would it help you to believe if he told if he told you where you came from or where you live? It would it help you to believe? And so the whole purpose of it was to help the people. The discernment of the hearts and intents, the thoughts and intents of the heart was to cause the people to believe. &gt;&gt; And by believing then they could enter in to the promise. &gt;&gt; Are you following that? And so now all of the scripture which we read says they can't enter into my rest and because of unbelief and in the day of temptation in the wilderness and the day of provocation and and so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief. And that's why that scriptures dropped in there at the end and it remainth that there is a rest for the people of God. And so God drops in and says and and for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword. Pentecost and so many people missed it because when they saw it happening and demonstrated manifesting in front of them, they thought well it's a gift of the Holy Spirit because they were gift conscious or some kind. And he says some think it's mental telepathy. One think it's mind readading or something else. No, he says and he quoted this scripture, the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart. And so then when it happened, they thought, oh, isn't this wonderful? God knows that, you know, I got somebody home and sick and they're they're they've got sugar diabetes or they've got cancer or I need an answer for this or I need an answer for that and and I wonder about this and I have these questions and oh, isn't it wonderful? We can come before uh God's prophet. I believe he's God's prophet. That's all lovely and that's all wonderful, but that wasn't the whole purpose of it. The purpose is that that they people would come to a place of faith &gt;&gt; and enter into God's rest. &gt;&gt; And this is a land and this is a time. This is a season. And God knew that this would have to be perfectly manifested in its full manifestation in this hour because this would be a day of all days &gt;&gt; that we would need to enter in to a rest. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to read some statements. On the seventh day, God rested from all his work. So he entered into a rest. In this rest period or this rest time, Satan crept in beneath the garden garden wall. Now when God I may repeat some of these things as we go on. When God created the whole creation, which certainly would have encompassed the globe, I'm sure he did his creation. The earth appeared, the waters had their bounds, and the heavens and everything was set in a certain motion. And I would have to say if it was God's creation, which it was, it was a perfect creation. But now within that perfection, God planted a garden &gt;&gt; called Eden. So we often think, well, Eden must have been a perfect place. No, the whole creation was a perfect creation. &gt;&gt; But within that creation, God plants God has a he planted a garden. And there would be the place for his son and his bride, his wife. It'd be a place where God, it was a special place place. And so Satan entered and crept in to the beneath the garden wall. And in this garden, the serpent approached Adam's bride. And I will call her Adam's garden bride &gt;&gt; because she was the place for his seed. &gt;&gt; A garden is where seeds are planted. And in the midst of this Eden, in the midst of this garden, was a tree called the tree of life, which was none other than Christ &gt;&gt; himself. Jesus Christ, the tree of life, is God's Sabbath. It's the only record that we have when God had finished Eden and he rested from his work. But we don't have any record where God has spoken in any part of the scripture says, "Oh my beloved Eden, I'm so satisfied with my Eden." No, it wasn't Eden that he was thrilled with. But when his son came on the scene, he said, "This is my beloved son &gt;&gt; in whom I am well pleased." &gt;&gt; He would have his rest in that son. And while Satan attempted to come to him in the wilderness, attempted to persuade him to worship Satan himself, he came to God's rest. &gt;&gt; He came to God's place of rest and attempted to disturb that rest. Satan, if you'll fall down and worship me, and that was just too much. Get behind me, Satan, &gt;&gt; thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. And he he just quoted him the scripture. But nevertheless, this one who God said spoke, "This is my beloved son more than once. Hear ye him." It was he that went to Calvary and did the redeeming work and paid the price for redemption. And because God's justice was satisfied, God's judgment was already fulfilled when the price was paid. And the earth which was lost by the first Adam is purchased back by the second Adam. And there's no wonder the creator could say he's at rest &gt;&gt; with this son. &gt;&gt; And it was not just that it would be his rest, but then he puts it forward. This is also your rest because he's the one that is doing the work of redemption &gt;&gt; with the first Adam in Eden. Help me now. &gt;&gt; In the first Adam in Eden, there was a &gt;&gt; it was uh well, this is a little bit difficult to explain, but Satan came through the serpent to bring a distress and to upset and to bring the fall. So now he approaches. He doesn't just come to Eden, but he comes to Adam's garden. &gt;&gt; He doesn't just come to God's garden, but he comes to his son's garden. &gt;&gt; Perhaps I can just give you this scripture, which we'll take and read later on, or at least I'll read it for you. in the Song of Solomon, which is a book of in incredible love and descriptions of of love and the and the bridegroom speaks and he speaks to his bride. He says that he calls her my sister, my spouse. And sister can be used also as bride. My sister, my spouse. Uh you are a garden. my sister, my spouse, &gt;&gt; my beloved one, you are a garden. Why? Because that's where the bridegroom will place his seed. &gt;&gt; And he said, and and she even invites him, come into your garden. &gt;&gt; You have to have supernatural thinking now. &gt;&gt; Come into come into your garden. &gt;&gt; And and uh and and and he smelt the myrr and the spices. It was a delightful. It was a place. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It was a specific place. And so, Satan through the serpent came to the first Adam's garden and swed a polluted seed. &gt;&gt; And brought the fall. &gt;&gt; And then if you go over to the book of Revelation, you'll find a new creation, &gt;&gt; another garden. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Another river planted &gt;&gt; and in the midst of the garden is the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; None other than Jesus Christ united once again with his bride. &gt;&gt; And he sent a messenger in this day to tell those that were called your blind womb is sealed. &gt;&gt; And he cannot sew his seed in your mind. He cannot distress the peace that I am bringing to you. You are called and I have sent a ministry that will actually unite you in a marriage. &gt;&gt; And as a heavenly parent, &gt;&gt; that's why the old customs was the parent &gt;&gt; would select a bride for his son. I say to you in all seriousness this morning, don't think too little of yourself when God could search the earth over and call you &gt;&gt; and select you and say, "You will make up &gt;&gt; the body that will be the wife of my son, &gt;&gt; my beloved son. the one I'm so satisfied with. The son that's my rest. My life is wrapped up in my son and you will be his wife. &gt;&gt; That ought to do something for you. &gt;&gt; And Satan will not be able to creep under this new creation wall. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The price has already been paid. And I came in a ministry of revealing the son of man, my son through Elijah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I came in that ministry &gt;&gt; to unite &gt;&gt; those that were elected in this end time. And as the prophet said, there will not be another one. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; There will not be another one. This ministry, it's not going to be married more than once. He's going to come and unite you to him, and you will be forever united with the groom. &gt;&gt; Come hither, said the angel, &gt;&gt; and I'll show you the lamb's wife. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be an old person. You don't have to be a mother, father. You don't even have to be a senior, you young people, to announce to you, you know, there's people being chosen today and we're having the Olympics in another uh few weeks here and uh I understand that I saw a picture in the newspaper of one of the young ladies and and it looked like she would stand on the podium and maybe have gold or silver or bronze. They were counting on her. She was Canada's uh uh she was Canada's, you know, lady to be the skier and and get gold. And here just in some lesser games and so on over in Italy, she injured her leg or broke her leg or something and it was all dashed and it just showed her wiping her tears because she'd been selected and to to stand in a place well nobody here I don't expect plans to stand on the Olympic stadium at the Olympic stand and that is a place of honor in the whole world and tens of millions of people will see it and it it is a place and I can tell you there'll be a feel there'll be a feeling of of fulfillment. There'll be a feeling of exhilaration. There'll be a feeling as though a person has achieved something. I worked my whole lifetime. This is why I got up at 3 in the morning and and and went to the hills and went to the jumps and went to whatever and just practiced and practiced and practiced. I ate right. I did this right. I did everything. So disciplined. So disciplined. They're not people my age or mothers and fathers. These are young people. &gt;&gt; But they're striving to stand on a certain podium. &gt;&gt; They're standing wanting to be selected for a certain place here in this world. And I tell you nothing that you have done but God Almighty who spoke from the heavens said this is my beloved son. carry him. And now he goes over the masses of humanity and and and by his predestination, he's going to choose certain ones and say, "You will be &gt;&gt; my son's wife." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Tell you, my brother, my sister, that's nothing to look down on. &gt;&gt; That's a most glorious thing. That's not something for you to think about for an hour or two while brother Ed is preaching this morning. That's something you want to take out of this place and go home and build on it. Say, "I've been called. I've been chosen. I've been elected. I've been predestinated. God has ordained it." And that's why this message meant something to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say, "Blessed art thou. &gt;&gt; Blessed are you people." Amen. &gt;&gt; I can't even tell you how blessed you are &gt;&gt; and how privileged we are to walk with one another &gt;&gt; and to shake each other's hand &gt;&gt; and to look in each other's face and to sit in the same building. &gt;&gt; How privileged we are. &gt;&gt; The Bible says this just a little summary now tying it into last week. one one sat on the throne and he had a book in his right hand and was sealed. I'm I'm not straying from where I'm at. You'll just have to jump with me. And he has a book. That book is the book of life. It's the record of human life. When the lamb takes it, it becomes a lamb's book of life. So he reaches out and he claims it. You're in that book. &gt;&gt; You're a little segment of that book. &gt;&gt; You are an epistle written by God, as I said last week. &gt;&gt; Known and read of all men. You are part of that book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there was part in there that needed this Sabbath. This one who took all the penalty. this one who was Boaz &gt;&gt; who was a mighty man of wealth &gt;&gt; and he had in him the blood &gt;&gt; that could atone for your sin &gt;&gt; and he was going to take the book with full knowledge of who you are and what you are and what you've been and what you will be and he took that book without any hesitation said this is my book &gt;&gt; in other words this is my people &gt;&gt; more More than that, this is my lover. &gt;&gt; This is my bride. More than that, this is my garden. &gt;&gt; I'm going to sew my seed &gt;&gt; in this garden. [Music] &gt;&gt; And this will be a special place is a book of life and also would be known as a book of redemption. that's not written and described that way in the scripture. But it took Elijah, the spirit of Elijah to come and in the end time as he's approaching now, he's already been met by seven angels. And he's now going to uh expose or reveal to the people what they said. And in preparation for the opening of the seals, in preparation for unfolding and revealing some things about you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And before he did that, he had to lay the foundation for it. So he's he goes to Revelation the 5th chapter said there's one on the throne, &gt;&gt; the oneness, &gt;&gt; only one God. And there's one on the throne and he's got in his hand a book. &gt;&gt; It's written and it's sealed with seven seals. &gt;&gt; And once the lamb rose, there was no one able to take the book and John wept. And the angel that was speaking to John said, "Weep not. The lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to loose the seals thereof." and he looked and he saw a lamb &gt;&gt; and the lamb rose. The lamb was standing, not sitting. The lamb rose and took the book. In other words, when he took the book, he claimed it &gt;&gt; and it became the book of redemption. &gt;&gt; And it took a prophet to uncover and reveal that the first Adam lost it all &gt;&gt; in the garden. He lost everything. But the second Adam is buying everything back. Redeem, buy back what was lost. &gt;&gt; And through Adam and the sexual birth, we lost it all also. But through the virgin birth and through the kinsman redeemer, we gained it all back. &gt;&gt; And there is a place in Christ, in him. There is a place an actual place that we can come to &gt;&gt; that is a place of rest. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you had distress today because of some something physical in the body, and I know even just recently there has been some, physical things. And we're so happy that this kinsman fixed it. Our sister Karen Ashdown. She here this morning. I don't think she's here. They're very, she'll forgive me. We know her like a daughter, but she's had biopsies for several months now, and they want to know if some growths, four large growths were cancerous. and she just got the results this last week that none of them none of them there's no cancer cells &gt;&gt; I say glory be to God &gt;&gt; unknown to the congregation we've been praying and we've been believing but I want to say now it's done &gt;&gt; hallelujah and it was done 2 years ago but it's done this kinsman when he bought it back &gt;&gt; he bought back that healing It is Satan. &gt;&gt; The devil. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "You may call it cancer, but it's a devil." &gt;&gt; And you can sit here maybe healthy this morning and not feel badly about it, but how thankful we are. We have a healer in our kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; I say, "Glory be to God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Let's thank him. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We give you glory. [Music] &gt;&gt; I can assure you &gt;&gt; if sickness came upon you or into your home or your husband, your wife, or your children or your parents, you'd be so urgent. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I know there's an answer. I know that you paid for it. Well, when we're not in directly in need, let us be filled with thanksgiving even in that time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I see Brother Toby clapping his hands. He has good reason to clap his hands. His his baby infant. They said something was wrong with this infant, a serious ailment. And brought her into the office and we prayed and took her back and she's completely 100% normal. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our God is real. &gt;&gt; This a kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; He took the book &gt;&gt; and claimed it. &gt;&gt; I want to say to you, you are claimed. &gt;&gt; You have been bought. &gt;&gt; We are not our own. [Applause] And in order to interpret this fifth chapter of Revelation, Brother Brandham goes back to one place &gt;&gt; to the book of Ruth. her own. And when he took the book, there were shoutings and rejoicings, thou art worthy. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham goes to one place and he goes back to the book of Ruth because she needed to be redeemed. &gt;&gt; And there was only one, a mighty man of wealth. &gt;&gt; And the prophet draws him out and says, "Boaz, &gt;&gt; the kinsman redeemer." And the Bible says, "So Boaz took Ruth. What did he do? He claimed her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He claimed her. You'll be mine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She was his garden. &gt;&gt; And when he swed his seed in her, there was rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before that, before the child was even born, &gt;&gt; before there was anything visible, may he be great. &gt;&gt; And you were swed with seed. &gt;&gt; And that's the mystery. That's the mystery of the book of redemption. You've been swed with seed. And when the angels in heaven and the 420 elders saw what was happening, oh, I hope you can see what I've seen. There was rejoicing. &gt;&gt; They rejoiced because they knew that the seed that had been sown would be great. &gt;&gt; And they said, "You're worthy to take this boy. You're worthy to take this woman. You're worthy to take this bride and sew your seed in her. &gt;&gt; This is your garden. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you've been chosen. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to make you feel good. You're the one that's sitting here. &gt;&gt; And if I asked you, why are you sitting here? You'd say, I heard a message. &gt;&gt; I heard a voice. And by virtue of that, I say on the basis of you hearing it, on the basis of you sitting here, God is declaring you've been called. &gt;&gt; You've been called not to a marriage. You've been called and are married. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This book is a complete book, a complete record of life. It is the mystery of God's plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To reveal revealing redemption. And so Boaz, who the prophet takes to unfold to us, so we can take back and read it and look at it. And so Boaz took Ruth and the Bible says, "And she became his wife." &gt;&gt; And when she when he went into her, the Lord gave her conception. &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm going to be speaking very very bluntly to adults. When the prophet messenger came, we have a physical man called William Brham, but in another dimension, in another realm, which he spoke very much about. He said, "I'm in two worlds. I'm in another world." He said, and he even talked about how he would how he would uh uh obtain access into that world, passing it off for us to letting us know by believing. We can come to a place of divine rest. We can come to a place the price has been paid. Everything is settled. The joy bells are ringing. The victory, the war is over. The victory's been won. Hallelujah. And there's no reason for the bride of Jesus Christ not to be filled with joy and rejoicing in the face of the darkest hour because as brother Joe Green said to me the other day, whichever way happens with mother, if she if she lives, she wins. If she dies, she wins. I said to my wife this morning, she said, "What does this new year hold for us?" I said, "Whatever it holds, we win." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We win. Whatever it holds for you, you win &gt;&gt; because you've been redeemed. Because you were part of the book and the lamb took the book. &gt;&gt; Not someone else. Not some great man. Not some king. The king of kings. The lord of lords, the redeemer took the book. [Music] &gt;&gt; And Boaz, the prophet is saying, Boaz is that perfect type. And Boaz took Ruth. &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ took you &gt;&gt; and Boaz went in unto her. And in this ministry, Jesus Christ went in unto you &gt;&gt; and gave you conception &gt;&gt; so that you could bring forth this great one, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Again, here on earth. Oh friends, &gt;&gt; I hope &gt;&gt; what a glorious thing. &gt;&gt; Just overcome. &gt;&gt; And the Lord gave her conception. and the Lord gave you conception. &gt;&gt; It wasn't really anything that Ruth did. &gt;&gt; It was everything that he did. &gt;&gt; So when Boaz took her, he was actually taking a segment. There was nothing written at that time. But he was taking a segment of this book. &gt;&gt; When the lamb took it, he took the whole book. &gt;&gt; Every person, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But when Boaz took her, he just took a little portion of the book. &gt;&gt; And he claimed her. &gt;&gt; He was elected to claim her. &gt;&gt; She was before the foundation of the world his. &gt;&gt; She was his wife. She was his garden. &gt;&gt; And out of her would come the beauty. &gt;&gt; Out of her would come Oed and Jesse. &gt;&gt; And out of Jesse would come David, &gt;&gt; the beloved king. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a garden. &gt;&gt; Came out of her. &gt;&gt; What a garden. &gt;&gt; What a place of beauty. What a place of power. What a glorious thing came out of her. Listen to me people that are sitting here and you that are streaming and those of you that are in Europe or in in New Zealand or in Switzerland or wherever Norway, wherever you are, he chose you. You are his garden. &gt;&gt; You are the place for his seed. &gt;&gt; And out of you comes, he came as the son of man and revealed himself. But you are the one to bring forth the fullness of that son of man. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is why I said the fullness that fillth all and all. &gt;&gt; You're not just a church goer. &gt;&gt; You're not just a bench warmer. &gt;&gt; You're not just someone who come to church two or three times a week. You are the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You are his garden. &gt;&gt; You're the elected place for his scene. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He already ordained it. You've been predestinated. &gt;&gt; We had a prophet &gt;&gt; to come and confirm that &gt;&gt; to come and establish that. &gt;&gt; And then unless the people would disbelieve, &gt;&gt; he would uh even the father himself in the pillar of fire would move in and begin to call the people out. &gt;&gt; So that he said now you can't believe &gt;&gt; how can you believe? How can you disbelieve? when he comes and vindicates and proves it &gt;&gt; like this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is a place there's an old song and says this. There is a place of quiet rest. Near to the heart of God. A place where sin cannot molest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Near to the heart of God. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus blessed redeemer sent from the heart of God. Hold us who wait before thee near to the heart of God. There is a place of comfort suite near to the heart of God. A place where our where we our savior meet near to the heart of God. There's a place of full release. Near to the heart of God. A place where all is joy and peace. &gt;&gt; Near to the heart of God. Oh Jesus, blessed redeemer sent from the heart of God. Hold us who wait before thee. Hold us near to the heart of God. There is a place. And I said, Lord, help me. Help me today. I want the people to know this. Not just a sermon. There's people, this is all chopped up, but I hope it means I have some continuity with you. Today we live in a time when people are searching and they're going to and fro and hither and yawn and they're seeking out leaders, gurus, teachers, stress management, all kinds of counseling, all kinds of websites, all kinds of things so that you can find and discover an inner peace. find this inner peace and people are yearning for it. They're longing for it. They're hungering for it. And they lap up all of this stuff and and people are are, you know, saying, "If you'll come here and if you'll just do this, I have a system. I have developed something and it will I guarantee you'll come to an inner peace." Well, I guarantee you won't. Brother Brennham, you know what? This is too simple, but I'm going to give it to you anyway. I have been so intrigued is not the word. Captivated is not the word. Completely consumed is not the word. There is no word for me to describe how involved I become when I hear the prophet being able and start calling people. And just as in the simplicity saying there's a there's that light. Do you see that light? He asked the people do you see the light? In other words, he believes that they should and maybe some did. That light is over this woman or this light is over this man. And and I'll tell you how you feel right now. You feel a real warm feeling. And I can tell you're a Christian because perhaps at sometime I'm just going all over the message now. I feel these vibrations coming and people wouldn't understand when he was talking about vibrations. Brother Brandham talked in a language that few people could understand because it was 40 years ago. And back then I'm going to read what the world was when he was talking about the waves coming through. And he it before a group of people and he said now there's cold waves coming through wave upon wave of skeptics. And then he'd say the next time now there's waves coming through. There's vibrations coming through. A welcome spirit. You are a Christian and you are welcoming him. And now I can tell you, you begin to feel real warm and all over. Brother Brand would say, "You don't understand. The people don't understand. But right now, I'm standing in two worlds." And he's telling what the pe he's telling to the people in this world what he's seeing in another world. So now it is it's something real for friends. It's not imagination. It's not just getting off and doing some yoga what they're seeking. It's not just going and sitting. It's not going to some eastern country to India or Thailand or some place to try to get it. And he he said it over and over again. And he said, I can prove to you he is here. &gt;&gt; I can prove to you he that came out of the tomb and was resurrected that he's right with us now. And I can say on the authority of what he said as the disciples followed Jesus Christ. I'm a disciple of this message. &gt;&gt; And they they perhaps couldn't do everything and couldn't perform everything that Jesus did. Many of them perhaps didn't have miracles or whatever more, but they believed he was the son of God. They believed that he died. They believe that he rose again. I believe it too. Do you? I believe that that same son of man sent this minister, sent this man of God, sent this spirit of Elijah. I believe that, don't you? &gt;&gt; And by believing it, you are you are the recipient. &gt;&gt; You are elected &gt;&gt; to believe it. &gt;&gt; And deny every every cold wave that comes in, tries to say, "Well, you're not worthy." Or we're not we're not talking about worthiness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're talking about what God has said. &gt;&gt; And you heard the word. You heard the message. You were attracted to it. &gt;&gt; Can you believe that's the greatest thing that could happen? It is even that in itself is uniting you with the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; That is uniting. Brother Brandon said the son of man, the Jesus Christ will come right through this right through this ministry. He'll come right through the ministry. And he did come right through the ministry. It wasn't it wasn't William Brandham coming through it. It was Jesus Christ coming through it. &gt;&gt; And he'll come right through this and unite the bride with the groom. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That was the glue. &gt;&gt; That ministry was the it was the contact cement. &gt;&gt; You cannot pull away from it. Right. &gt;&gt; But when I hear him and he begins to tell the people and I remember my heart being revealed. I thought, "Oh my, oh my." And I hear it has never never lost its effect. I'm affected perhaps even more now than I was so many years ago. that same one. And I say, Jesus, you came and you used this vessel to get a hold of my heart and get a hold of others hearts and allow us to walk together. You came the son of man using this son of man who was so completely given over and now brother Brandon makes it. Stay with me. He said now he was trying to explain things and he got into trouble by explaining things, but he would say this. He'd say, cuz people were wondering, he'd say, "Two and two makes four. Two and two makes four. Two and two makes four. Two and two makes four. Two and two makes four." Or he said he might pick another number. You may not understand this. I'm not trying to get you to understand it. I'm trying to get you to understand where he where it got him. &gt;&gt; And he physically, of course, he was ordained to it, but let's not stop there. He would physically move to a place standing between two worlds and bring he didn't bring consternation to the people. He didn't bring despondency to the people. very seldom. Only once that I know of in South Africa, he said to a woman that came up and he said, "I see a I see a funeral procession and it's yours." She was a white woman and she was, shall I say, she was disturbed and upset that all these other people are receiving such wonderful things. And now she's been told and Brother Brandham told her, "As far as God is concerned, it's already happened." And she walked off in a bit of a huff. And Brother Brandham said, "A short time later, there was a bit of a commotion and she had all passed away in the meeting." Two and two is four. Two and two is four. two and two is four. Two. What's he saying? He gets his thoughts in his mind. You can't have a mind that's full of your studies and full of your job and full of your debts and full of everything else and just stuffed right out and what are we going to do and this that and all of these things. You can't have that. You got to say, "Oh, Holy Spirit turns that all out." &gt;&gt; When it comes time to pay a bill, just pay it. or when it comes time to have another job, just do it. But but we we cannot succumb and become overwhelmed &gt;&gt; with all the burdens of life and these things of life. We cannot friends, we cannot &gt;&gt; our bridegroom, I don't know how to convey this. He of whom I speak is here. Amen. &gt;&gt; He of whom I speak is the one that's speaking to you. &gt;&gt; Not even through these lips, but he of whom I speak, there's a still small voice. &gt;&gt; And you've heard it &gt;&gt; and it has told you, &gt;&gt; draw nearer. &gt;&gt; Less of this &gt;&gt; and more of him. less of all of these things &gt;&gt; that clutter &gt;&gt; and distract us and drag us down. &gt;&gt; Less and less of this and more of him. Don't worry, you won't become too spiritual. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What am I saying? Do you know why the message came about two years ago? I was with brother Lonnie Jenkins, brother Jeff Jenkins in his church and it came so real that the rapture before it's a before it's an actual location that you will go to it will be a place that you will enter into right here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus stood right here &gt;&gt; and he said, "Even the son of man," you know where it is, John the 3r chapter, I think about the 12th verse, "He that ascended up is the same that descended." And and he said, "And even the son of man which is in heaven standing right there." Brother Brandham said, "That would take an inoculation." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham understood that. There is a place. &gt;&gt; And you might say, "Well, brother Ed, why don't you make it more clear?" Well, I'll tell you why. I'm also seeking it. I am conveying to you my desire, my anticipation, what I long for, what I intend to move towards. And I simply want to announce to you, there is a place. &gt;&gt; I can see it all through the scripture. I could go right back to I could go right back to Genesis into Eden right now. The serpent didn't launch Eve into space. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; she's right there. &gt;&gt; But she certainly she certainly was transported to another place. &gt;&gt; A place of pain, a place where she'd experienced death. a very very very &gt;&gt; very sad place. &gt;&gt; And the second Adam came to take you out of this place &gt;&gt; to another place &gt;&gt; and that place is not some pie in the sky. That place is not something that's remote and far removed from you. that place is close to you as close as your breath &gt;&gt; because that is why he came with the scripture. For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even the dividing of sunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of your heart. I want to say to this congregation, and you know what I'm saying is the truth. &gt;&gt; And you know what I'm saying? God has already witnessed to your heart. &gt;&gt; God has another place for me. God has &gt;&gt; not just something, you know, slightly better or where he wants to touch me where I just get blessed today and go home and say, "Was a wonderful service." I don't care whether you say it's a wonderful service or what it is, but you'll go home and just have that one thing just anchored. And if you don't find it tomorrow or tomorrow night or next week, you go and say, "Not brother Ed said it, but you sent a messenger to say and what brother Ben Brandham said a multitude of times." And he quotes John 14. I go to prepare a place for you. &gt;&gt; That where I am, not where I will be, but where I am. &gt;&gt; And he stood right here on this earth and said, even the son of man which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; You might say, brother Ed, are you doing away with a physical place? Not at all. But I'm saying the way to get there is by something that happens here. &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I personally think that if we were just to continue, we can't just be you can't just be, you know, have a nice little home and a family. You can't just have a social &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Fellowship. &gt;&gt; We're not getting there on social fellowship. We're getting there by the revelation of God's word to your individual heart where you can say, "I see it. &gt;&gt; I receive it." &gt;&gt; And even if you don't see it, say, "I receive it. &gt;&gt; I accept it. I acknowledge it. There is a place for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And by God's grace, I shall move into that realm." Brother Brandham calls it a sphere. He calls it realms. He calls it dimensions. Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Think of this. &gt;&gt; I came across where I thought I I'd like to find out where brother Brandham first makes reference because he speaks about the television and the waves and the radio waves and he said the crystals or whatever you call it. I thought, when did Brother Brandham start talking about television? It was even in the 50s before it even reached our town. And the people were so ignorant, they didn't even know how to plug it into the wall to get it started. I had a friend who was he had the he had the job of going and and plugging in getting getting the pattern on cuz a certain hour it was going to come on in our town. And when it came on here's all this just nothing but snow. And he'd come out and I said, "Well, how was it?" He said, "It's just amazing." He said, "People the front room are full of people. The whole family's gathered and all just staring at that screen with all that snow, not seeing anything. Think this is the most amazing thing. Say simple people. Well, when brother Brandham first started to talk about the waves in the television, trying to describe what it was that he was conveying to the people where he was and how it was and how it so he tried to describe it for them when he was talking for the first time about the television waves. A car cost $1,800. Some of you people pay rent for that much or payment, mortgage payment. A car was $1,800. Gasoline was 27 cents a gallon. A house cost 16,000. Bread was 16 cents a loaf. Milk was 92 cents a gallon. Postage stamp was 3 cents. The stock market was $269. The average annual salary was $4,200 for the year. And the minimum wage was 75 cents an hour. And in that environment, here's a man standing. Waves are coming through. Hey, the people just got, &gt;&gt; how are they going to understand that? &gt;&gt; He's a prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a pleasant. He's not in this world. He's talking about another world &gt;&gt; where these things are real. &gt;&gt; And he told them plainly, "Pictures are going through and bodies are going through and colors are going through the room. You think they could understand that?" Listen friends, if I could say it to you, that's a real world more real than the one you're sitting in. That's the vessel &gt;&gt; who told you. &gt;&gt; You've been united. &gt;&gt; You've been actually selected by the parent, by the father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You've been selected by the father &gt;&gt; to be a wife &gt;&gt; to his son &gt;&gt; who had said, "You are my beloved son." Think of what he faced of his wife. &gt;&gt; Your beloved woman. &gt;&gt; You were selected not to be carpenters or plumbers or mechanics or just housewives even that. All of those are ministry. But you've been selected. I'd love to go down shake everyone your hand and tell you you've been selected to carry seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are his garden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is why when he took the book when he was taking you &gt;&gt; the four and 20 elders, they couldn't hold their seat any longer. &gt;&gt; They had to leap to their feet and stand up and give glory to God and said, "Worthy art thou? Amen. &gt;&gt; Worthy art thou to take this book? And when Boaz took her, they said, Worthy art thou, and may she be a fruitful bow to you. May she be a fruitful one and bring forth, and may she be greater than those that came before. &gt;&gt; There's bigger churches and more glamorous things. But I say in whatever days and time and years or month that months that God gives us, may God pour out &gt;&gt; first an illumination that you can grasp. I've been chosen. May the depth of that come upon you. May it not be some just some words out of Brother Biscllow's mouth. You should say it to yourself, even if you say it quietly. &gt;&gt; I've been chosen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've actually been chosen by the creator of heavens and earth. &gt;&gt; Look up at the stars tonight. It's a clear night. Look up at the stars and say, "He who cast all those and spread them throughout the heavens, &gt;&gt; you have chosen me. Oh my father, the creator of heavens and earth, you've chosen me. &gt;&gt; You've put me here as one little speck of dust on this earth. But in this speck of dust, &gt;&gt; if you had a cell of your body, you wouldn't even be able to see it with this eye. But that cell has the color of your hair, every part of your nature, your DNA. Think what God, the creator, did when he put you here as a cell of his wife's body. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I have many pages, but I'm not going to tire you. I just want to go home myself &gt;&gt; and let this all soak in. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been so help me and forgive me, but I've been so in wonderment about it. And I passed it by my wife and I tried to talk to her about the garden and and I could see it from Genesis all the way to Revelation. I could see it. I could see it all tying together even to the point I can't even begin to bring all the places. But I'll just tell you, it is there. &gt;&gt; It's all through the scripture. You've been called by him. The mystery of this book of redemption, the mysterious part of it is and when it it becomes so mysterious and the word the word mysterious is the word mystery in the scripture would be the same as uh what do they call those things when they an initiation you go to maybe Princeton or Harvard or some university or some you actually enter you say I want to enter this certain field I want to enter I want to go to Princeton. I want to enter and be in the Marine Corps. I want to enter the armed services. No, I want to enter a certain class of it. I I want to enter into a into an officer's class. So when I come out, I'll be an officer. And in order to do this, you have to pass a certain tests. And then when you pass them, you get accepted. And then when you get accepted, you know, they have often an initiation. Some of the initiations have been very gross and men, I suppose, women too, but have even lost their lives in the initiation. They call initiation ceremony, don't they? &gt;&gt; And and and and the more the more there's some very very secret God help me. Are you staying with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; There's some very very secret groups, a very very secret enclosed groups and you can't hardly penetrate them. I'm reading right now a book on the history of the Mossad which is the one of the most elite of secret services in the world. They are a secret service at the CIA in the United States. the Boss Boss in Africa, the French Secret Service, the M15 and M16 from Britain, the Russian Secret Service, the KBG. They all have admired and respected the MOSAD because it seems that they have such a unique way and they know things when no one else knows things. In this book, they tell them, I won't even begin to get into it, but most all of you know a Princess Diana of of England and was killed in that car crash out of in in Paris. The driver of that car happened to be the head of security of the Ritz Hotel, which was actually not an agent, but he was an informer to the Mosad. And they knew things about Princess Diana that none no one else knew, including the queen and all of her people. They're so they're so respected and admired. Yeah, they've had their they've had their flub ups. They've had their mistakes, but in there they're trying to get access to the Vatican and they're trying to find a way. And the pre the president and premier of of of of Israel is saying, "But but who can who can rally the people like the Pope can?" And they're fulfilling the scripture. They're looking on her as John admired &gt;&gt; with admiration, with great admiration &gt;&gt; at this power. And they also look upon her and say, "How can they keep their themselves so enclosed and so tight and so protected that even we, the most elite of the world, cannot penetrate into the inner sanctums of the Vatican and even express their desire right from the president on down and that no secret service." And then when finally some get into the maybe the outer outer court of it, they just are they they're moving for position. They're kind of, you know, jostling for position so they can get who can get the closest. I thought, "Oh my god." Things that the prophet of God said that I didn't even understand just began to go up into great big flames of light, begin to see exactly what he said. And here he's just preaching it across the pulpit to people and they haven't got a clue what he's saying. But he's talking maybe 40, 50 years in the future. And you and I have been united to this kind of information, this kind of word, this kind of revelation. You've been invited to it. I wouldn't take that invitation lightly. &gt;&gt; It's absolutely incredible that this is what we've been called to. I'm going a little bit slow because I just had so much and it was kind of scattered in my mind. The mystery. And if this doesn't just sound right, you'll forgive me. But the real mystery of Eden was not the serpent seat in Eve's womb. But the mystery, the real mystery was that Adam took her. Brother Bram said he took her quickly. &gt;&gt; And he didn't take her and just hug her. He didn't take and just kiss her. He swed his seed in her because he knew that God could not destroy her &gt;&gt; with his seed in her. And even though that was righteous Abel, it was Abel who was a type of Christ. And his was the first blood that was ever shed on the earth outside of an animal blood. But his was the first blood that was shed on the earth. Cain slew him, but God raised up another seed &gt;&gt; and that seed remained forever. Yes. &gt;&gt; The real mystery when Boaz took Ruth and took her into the into the tent and and she conceived. No one knew that but God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the mystery of her conception. She was carrying a royal seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She didn't know it. Boaz didn't know it. No one knew it. God knew it. She's carrying a royal seed in her womb. That was the mystery. &gt;&gt; When the Song of Solomon speaks of his sister, his spouse, his garden, he said the garden is enclosed. The garden is a sealed place. This garden is not available to anyone else. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This bride is not available to anyone else. &gt;&gt; This bride is not available to any man's doctrine. &gt;&gt; This bride is an enclosed garden. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just take it and digest that. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is why when the prophet now who's ordained to bring it to us in this generation, that's why you can go and read it into breach now. And he calls it the mystery of redemption. &gt;&gt; If you just take redemption for, you know, for uh uh uh face value say, well, it's something that was lost. It was something that's bought back. We lost it with the first Adam. We gained it back with the second atom. That's fine. That's at face value. But it's greater than that. How did he redeem us? &gt;&gt; He redeemed us by coming to us &gt;&gt; in this ministry. &gt;&gt; Listen, when brother Brandham was here, Brother Brandham said, "Who did she touch? Who did he touch?" I'm just going now to the first pull because that indicates exactly what was happening all through the ministry. Who did they touch? Not me. &gt;&gt; They're 30 feet, 40 feet, 50 feet from me. They touched him. &gt;&gt; They actually reached through. But now here was a man in this world able to see from another world to tell people who are in this world. You touched him in another world. &gt;&gt; You actually touched him &gt;&gt; in another world. And here he is in this world. You talk about television. Television knows nothing about this. &gt;&gt; Man's science knows nothing about this. This is God's science. Amen. &gt;&gt; Had Elijah standing here &gt;&gt; seeing both worlds &gt;&gt; following a pillar of fire saying, "You touched him." &gt;&gt; And that one that was with him was going to stay with him, was going to open and reveal to him what was sealed in the book. and then tell him, go down and tell them the mystery of redemption is that she's my wife and I have chosen her and she's married to me and I have sown her with seed. &gt;&gt; And maybe these things now mean something. That's why the prophet said, "You're a virgin bride. &gt;&gt; You're sowing with seed." &gt;&gt; And that truly made you his. You're not his because you said some tears at an altar. &gt;&gt; You're not his just because you said some words of repentance. You're not his because of some experience you had down here. You're his because he did it. &gt;&gt; He made you in a certain way. He made you to be his wife. He made you so that you could receive his seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he knows even that seed can never come to judgment because he was judged for you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The second Adam, &gt;&gt; the second Adam. &gt;&gt; Oh, the lamb &gt;&gt; and the book of redemption. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've got to go home and think this over the thing myself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, it's just so wonderful. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you young people. I I I you might not think so, but I I sit at home and I worry about you. I worry about all the young people. I worry about the ones that are children. I think, "Oh, God, are they going to get anything out of this? Did you get something out of it?" Good. &gt;&gt; You kids get something out of it? Did it go over there? &gt;&gt; I hope that some of it even came down here. &gt;&gt; It's all right, young man. &gt;&gt; Good. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. &gt;&gt; I want to sing a strange song. Uh, let's go on. Let's go on talking about this good old way. I need a musician. I need a singer. I need some help. I can sing it, but it might not be the right key. Brother Brand saying this over and over again. That's the way I feel today. We're starting maybe in a few days, another year. Let's go on. Let's go on. Hallelujah. carriers. Do you accept that today? &gt;&gt; Carriers, you've heard it. You've heard it. But I just want it to explode with illumination and light and a revelation that you go out from this place. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So much better talking about this good old way. So much better talking about the Lord. So let's go on. Let's go on talking about this new way. Let's go on. Let's go on talking about the Lord. He don't like it. Talking about this good way. He don't like it talking about the Lord. Oh, so let's go on. Let's go on talking about this old way. Let's go on. Let's go on talking about the Lord. Feeling so much better. Talking about this new way. Feeling so much better. Talking about the Lord. So let's go on. Let's go on talking about this old way. Let's go on. Let's go on talking about the Lord. I'd like you to sing this chorus again. Feeling so much better. You turn around, shake hands with as many as you can. Feeling so much better, talking good old way. Feeling so much better talking about the Lord. Let's go on. Let's go on. talking about this way. Let's go on. Let's go on talking about feeling so much better. Talking about this feeling so much better talking. Let's go on. Let's go on talking about this good old way. Let's go on. Let's go on talking about Let's make that a habit now. And I can guarantee you one thing. The devil, he don't like it talking about this good old way. The devil, he don't like it when talking about the Lord. Oh, so let's go on. Let's go on talking about this. Let's go on. Let's go on talking about the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Tom, you come and ask Brother Tom to pray God's blessings upon you and have a wonderful afternoon. And Lord willing, we'll see you Thursday evening, 9:00. Glory. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I feel good. Amen. In the presence of God. Let's thank him for the word we heard this morning. Heavenly Father, I'm so thankful to know, Lord, that we have a transportation, Lord. It's not on tracks. It's not by jet fuel, but Lord, it's by revelation. and you're moving us from glory and to glory unto glory until Lord, we come into that place rapture ready, ready to take on a new body. Lord, we just pray for more revelation that as you will inspire your ministry, our pastor. We pray God that that revelation will be our portion also that we could bring forth much fruit within our lives. That we could be called the garden of God. That we could bring forth Jesus Christ. What a privilege. What an honor it is, Lord God, that we can join our voices together with those throughout eternity. We've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Take your portion this morning. And may you receive all glory and honor. Go with your people. We pray now in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. service is over. Stay as long as you want for whatever you do. Walk in the fullness. Walk in this light. Don't don't let the devil put even a you know this is a womb of the for the Lord's seed. Just &gt;&gt; let that conception just bring forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Have a wonderful afternoon. God bless you. [Music]
