[0:01] the church today just like it was in in
[0:05] Eden at the east of the gate there was
[0:09] Cain he made a an altar he built it
[0:12] there and erected in Memorial of
[0:16] Jehovah he wasn't Infidel he made the
[0:20] Altar and in commemoration of Jehovah
[0:23] and put a sacrifice on it and laid
[0:26] himself on the Altar and called out to
[0:29] God
[0:30] God and God refused his calling out
[0:34] because it didn't have the right
[0:38] sound there was nothing that a cow that
[0:41] was
[0:43] dying there was nothing no death to
[0:47] appeasing that sin had to be paid for by
[0:52] death the day you eat thereof that day
[0:55] you
[0:56] die and he put flowers and made it
[0:58] pretty but there was nothing there to
[1:01] say that there was death and from the
[1:03] altar of Abel came The Cry of
[1:08] alarm there was death to pay the penalty
[1:12] blood was being shed Hallelujah and
[1:16] today when God just like it was in that
[1:19] day when he told Ken Ken was
[1:22] discouraged he said here's the best I
[1:25] can do you can take it or leave it do
[1:27] anything you want to about it but that's
[1:30] all I can do about it that's the way the
[1:32] modern Christian worships today I go to
[1:36] church I help the preachers I pay my
[1:40] tiing i h h if they got any a social
[1:43] party I I I put my part on it and if the
[1:47] if they need a missionary offering I I
[1:49] help in it that's good but that's not
[1:52] what God requires he's got to hear the
[1:55] sound of
[1:58] death God what God wants today is you to
[2:02] die die to the things of the world and
[2:04] yourself yes fre Lord take me as I
[2:09] [Music]
[2:11] am but in the days of the voice of the
[2:13] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[2:15] sound the mystery of God should be
[2:18] finished as he hath declared to his
[2:20] servants the prophets
